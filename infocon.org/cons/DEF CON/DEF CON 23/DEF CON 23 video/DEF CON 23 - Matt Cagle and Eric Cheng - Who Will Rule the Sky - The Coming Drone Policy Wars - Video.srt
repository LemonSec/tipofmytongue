00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:04.504
All right. So welcome to --
we're track 1 here, our 11:00

00:00:04.504 --> 00:00:10.510
talk is who will rule the sky.
We have Matt Cagle and Eric

00:00:13.347 --> 00:00:18.919
Cheng here to give us a nice
talk. And please help me welcome

00:00:18.919 --> 00:00:23.457
Matt and Eric. (Applause.) >>
Hey, everyone. I'm Matt Cagle.

00:00:23.457 --> 00:00:28.729
I'm a telling and civil
liberties and policy attorney at

00:00:28.729 --> 00:00:34.534
the ACLU of northern California
and today we're here to talk

00:00:34.534 --> 00:00:40.340
about drones owned by people
like you and me, not drones used

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:44.311
by law enforcement, but drones
owned by normal human beings.

00:00:44.311 --> 00:00:48.181
There's a ton of really
interesting policy issues that

00:00:48.181 --> 00:00:51.718
private or civilian drone
ownership raises. And they're

00:00:51.718 --> 00:00:53.987
going to be decided by
manufacturers, they're going to

00:00:53.987 --> 00:00:55.989
be by policy makers and they're
going to be decided by people

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:57.991
who understand code. Free
expression and privacy are

00:00:57.991 --> 00:01:03.931
obviously issues at the core of
civilian drone use. And today

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.504
we're going to talk about those
issues through the lens of two

00:01:10.504 --> 00:01:13.373
pretty interesting case studies.
But first I'm going to hand it

00:01:13.373 --> 00:01:19.079
off to Eric from DJI. >> I don't
have to hand anything off. >>

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:21.982
Hi, guys. My name is Eric Cheng.
I'm the director of error

00:01:21.982 --> 00:01:26.820
imaging at DJI. How many of you
have seen a phantom in the air?

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.124
(Applause.) Yeah, okay. Slow
clap. That's great. Thanks for

00:01:31.124 --> 00:01:36.430
that. How many of you have flown
a phantom? That's a pretty big

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:39.599
percentage >> So everybody look
under your seats right now -- >>

00:01:39.599 --> 00:01:42.536
No, no. >> Just kidding. >> I
was told not to fly this on the

00:01:42.536 --> 00:01:46.974
way in so there will not be any
fun stuff unless we can get away

00:01:46.974 --> 00:01:51.044
with it later. (Laughter.) So
DJI has been manufacturing

00:01:51.044 --> 00:01:55.949
phantoms and other aerial
imaging products for quite some

00:01:55.949 --> 00:02:03.523
time, but for the past say two
and a half years, there's been a

00:02:03.523 --> 00:02:07.928
huge explosion in the number out
there and if you do a search on

00:02:07.928 --> 00:02:11.098
YouTube or something, you'll
find several million videos of

00:02:11.098 --> 00:02:14.968
people doing great things and
not so great things with them.

00:02:14.968 --> 00:02:18.972
And that leads to discussions
like this. So one of the things

00:02:18.972 --> 00:02:22.509
I did was put together a short
video so those of you who

00:02:22.509 --> 00:02:25.512
haven't seen these videos yet
can see what people are using

00:02:25.512 --> 00:02:28.648
them from. Not all the footage
is mine. Some of it is. And,

00:02:28.648 --> 00:02:32.419
yeah. >> And I do want to
mention that if anyone has

00:02:32.419 --> 00:02:35.856
questions, I'm going to be
looking at my Twitter mentions

00:02:35.856 --> 00:02:38.458
when I get a chance. So if folks
have questions and we don't get

00:02:38.458 --> 00:02:45.165
to questions at the end
potentially, just tweet them at

00:02:45.165 --> 00:02:51.171
me and we will try to get to
some of them during the talk.

00:04:13.186 --> 00:04:19.192
But here's the video. >> Okay.
So that was an awesome video.

00:05:24.391 --> 00:05:27.527
Thanks for putting that
together. So we're here today

00:05:27.527 --> 00:05:29.863
again, I want to emphasize, to
talk about the civilian use of

00:05:29.863 --> 00:05:37.704
drones. Oh, yeah, thank you. How
I encounter drones as an ACLU

00:05:37.704 --> 00:05:41.808
attorney is predominantly in the
context of government agencies

00:05:41.808 --> 00:05:45.278
using drones, as folks are
pretty aware probably, federal

00:05:45.278 --> 00:05:49.216
funding is allowing law
enforcement to purchase any

00:05:49.216 --> 00:05:52.118
number of surveillance
technologies. Drones are one of

00:05:52.118 --> 00:05:55.589
these toys and technology is
that police departments want to

00:05:55.589 --> 00:05:59.793
get their hands on as well. But
when it comes to the civilian

00:05:59.793 --> 00:06:03.096
context, it's different. There
are privacy and free speech

00:06:03.096 --> 00:06:06.533
issues that the use of drones by
all of us raise and there are a

00:06:06.533 --> 00:06:11.137
separate set of issues. And so
today's talk overlaps with those

00:06:11.137 --> 00:06:15.075
somewhat, but it's really about
drones used by people like you

00:06:15.075 --> 00:06:18.712
and me to look at police
protests, to take footage of

00:06:18.712 --> 00:06:22.382
whatever things we want to take
footage of. So I'm going to hand

00:06:22.382 --> 00:06:26.987
it off to Eric now because we
need to give a little bit of a

00:06:26.987 --> 00:06:30.991
framework for where the law is
at on this right now. As folks

00:06:30.991 --> 00:06:33.760
know the FAA has primary
jurisdiction at the federal

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:36.830
level over drones and there's
been some recent movement on

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:40.500
that and things are kind of in
flux both for the commercial

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:45.205
space and also for hobbyists. >>
So right now we have proposed --

00:06:45.205 --> 00:06:48.508
a set of proposed rules that
have not been finalized. And

00:06:48.508 --> 00:06:52.045
those govern commercial usage.
What we're here to talk about

00:06:52.045 --> 00:06:55.815
mostly is noncommercial usage of
drones how people might use them

00:06:55.815 --> 00:06:58.551
today and how they might use
them going forward. If you look

00:06:58.551 --> 00:07:01.788
up here there are model aircraft
guidelines that were issued in

00:07:01.788 --> 00:07:08.261
1981 and there was also an FAA
reform act in 2012. And these

00:07:08.261 --> 00:07:14.267
basically carve spaces out for
model aircraft hobbyists to

00:07:17.003 --> 00:07:20.573
operate in a space outside of
FAA jurisdiction. So there are a

00:07:20.573 --> 00:07:22.976
set of these categories and
rules that you have to follow.

00:07:22.976 --> 00:07:27.514
So that would be less than 55
pounds with not close to an

00:07:27.514 --> 00:07:30.417
airport, either three miles or
five miles depending what you've

00:07:30.417 --> 00:07:34.587
read. And if you're closer, you
have to notify the tower and of

00:07:34.587 --> 00:07:38.692
course the safety guidelines.
All of these things that you

00:07:38.692 --> 00:07:43.163
follow end up putting you in a
category that is outside what an

00:07:43.163 --> 00:07:46.499
unmanned aircraft might be --
the regulations that would apply

00:07:46.499 --> 00:07:51.871
to an unmanned aircraft by the
FAA. I'm big a little vague in

00:07:51.871 --> 00:07:54.274
talking around this stuff
because that's of course what

00:07:54.274 --> 00:07:58.411
the FAA says and there was a big
comment period that was just

00:07:58.411 --> 00:08:03.049
last year and, I don't know, do
you have more from the legal

00:08:03.049 --> 00:08:05.585
stand point about this? >> Yeah.
It's really interesting that the

00:08:05.585 --> 00:08:09.022
FAA went forward with these
rules for commercial drone use

00:08:09.022 --> 00:08:12.058
and they specifically, because
of the law that congress passed,

00:08:12.058 --> 00:08:16.129
specifically carved out this
space for hobbyist drones and it

00:08:16.129 --> 00:08:19.532
told the FAA you should tread
lightly in this space right now.

00:08:19.532 --> 00:08:23.970
So there's really kind of a
vacuum when it comes to rules --

00:08:23.970 --> 00:08:26.806
besides these general criteria
and guidelines that the FAA has

00:08:26.806 --> 00:08:30.543
put out there, an extension of
their previous model airplane

00:08:30.543 --> 00:08:34.614
kind of rules, there's kind of a
vacuum as to where the FAA is

00:08:34.614 --> 00:08:38.118
moving right now. Could you -- I
was curious Eric we talked the

00:08:38.118 --> 00:08:40.687
other day you said there is kind
of a gap in the rules, when it

00:08:40.687 --> 00:08:43.790
comes to different designations
of drones and how that might

00:08:43.790 --> 00:08:47.560
play out. >> What we're seeing
in the U.S. right now is one

00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:52.165
giant category which is between
0 to 55 pounds. Obviously the

00:08:52.165 --> 00:08:55.769
kinds of products that are
within 0 to 55 pounds are huge.

00:08:55.769 --> 00:08:59.973
You can buy a remote controlled
paper airplane right now and

00:08:59.973 --> 00:09:05.779
that would be in the same
category. We're seeing some

00:09:05.779 --> 00:09:09.549
momentum around potentially
micro drone, the category would

00:09:09.549 --> 00:09:13.253
be 2 kilograms and under. This
matches what a lot of countries

00:09:13.253 --> 00:09:18.491
who have figured this out have
done, categorize it by kinetic

00:09:18.491 --> 00:09:22.562
energy. How much damage can this
thing cause. If it's small and

00:09:22.562 --> 00:09:25.799
fast it can cause damage and if
it's big and slow it can also

00:09:25.799 --> 00:09:30.870
cause damage. What you're seeing
here on the right, what can I do

00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:34.974
with my model aircraft, this is
part of a publicity campaign

00:09:34.974 --> 00:09:40.313
called know before you fly by
FAA and some others, and this is

00:09:40.313 --> 00:09:44.517
kind of the state of education
right now. You get this thing in

00:09:44.517 --> 00:09:46.820
a box, maybe if you buy a
product, maybe you don't get it.

00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:51.591
But we're largely left to figure
out by ourselves what is okay

00:09:51.591 --> 00:09:55.462
and what is not. Because the
information is not ingrained in

00:09:55.462 --> 00:09:58.164
us yet because it's such a new
technology. So it's a pretty

00:09:58.164 --> 00:10:00.500
interesting space. The other
thing that complicates things is

00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:04.270
that the consumer products that
the companies like DJI are

00:10:04.270 --> 00:10:09.375
making are the same products
being used commercially. So it's

00:10:09.375 --> 00:10:13.513
hard to draw an arbitrary line
around commercialism and have

00:10:13.513 --> 00:10:16.449
rules on one that don't apply to
the other. So I think it's going

00:10:16.449 --> 00:10:19.385
to be a really interesting space
going forward. >> And in the

00:10:19.385 --> 00:10:21.387
meantime while these rules are
pending, at least for the

00:10:21.387 --> 00:10:25.525
commerce space, the FAA has
started issuing certifications

00:10:25.525 --> 00:10:28.928
of authorization and exemptions
which they're authorized to do

00:10:28.928 --> 00:10:33.032
to the commercial space. But
again the hobbyists relying on a

00:10:33.032 --> 00:10:37.470
smaller set of criteria and
guidelines that aren't going

00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:39.906
through a formal rule-making
process right now. One thing

00:10:39.906 --> 00:10:43.009
that is kind of missing from the
FAA rules and regulations is

00:10:43.009 --> 00:10:45.245
guidelines for privacy and
guidelines for addressing

00:10:45.245 --> 00:10:53.086
privacy issues and free speech
issues really. So they're very

00:10:53.086 --> 00:10:56.256
focused on safety, getting
drones into the sky in a way

00:10:56.256 --> 00:11:01.694
that they see fit. But as the
FAA waits, states are really

00:11:01.694 --> 00:11:05.431
moving forward with their own
legislation. This is just kind

00:11:05.431 --> 00:11:08.601
of a chart I pulled together,
the only part of the chart that

00:11:08.601 --> 00:11:13.039
starts to canvas the state of
laws that propose passing the

00:11:13.039 --> 00:11:18.044
private drone use, drone use by
people like you and me, there's

00:11:18.044 --> 00:11:21.781
a whole other slew of laws that
states are passing that limit

00:11:21.781 --> 00:11:25.585
the government's use of drones.
There's a ton of laws now, quite

00:11:25.585 --> 00:11:31.958
a few laws that govern things
like peeping Tom statues,

00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:36.129
criminal trespass laws and
states are looking at where are

00:11:36.129 --> 00:11:41.000
the privacy harms and where do
we need to act. While there are

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.404
absolutely legitimate areas
where states should be acting in

00:11:44.404 --> 00:11:48.808
this space, there are also a few
interesting examples of laws

00:11:48.808 --> 00:11:53.513
that are just being drafted in a
very broad sense. So at the top

00:11:53.513 --> 00:11:56.916
there is actually a provision
that is now law in Idaho. And

00:11:56.916 --> 00:12:00.920
this provision actually says you
may not use a drone to

00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:04.457
photograph somebody without
their written consent if your

00:12:04.457 --> 00:12:07.460
purpose is to publish or
otherwise disseminate that

00:12:07.460 --> 00:12:10.897
photo. That's pretty broad
language and it's not cabined

00:12:10.897 --> 00:12:17.036
elsewhere in the statute. It can
limit your ability to take

00:12:17.036 --> 00:12:20.873
photos police officers during a
protest with the drone if you

00:12:20.873 --> 00:12:23.943
are part of the news media, for
instance. That language could

00:12:23.943 --> 00:12:29.015
also be read to take my ability
to take the SD card and take the

00:12:29.015 --> 00:12:32.318
photo and send it out over
Instagram. That would be

00:12:32.318 --> 00:12:38.291
dissemination. Another
interesting area, just as a

00:12:38.291 --> 00:12:42.862
sidebar, states are passing a
lot of drone laws that relate to

00:12:42.862 --> 00:12:47.767
hunting. There are at least I
think half a dozen laws that

00:12:47.767 --> 00:12:52.405
prevent using a drone to hunt
for game or fish. So apparently

00:12:52.405 --> 00:12:56.242
people are either trying that or
hunters are concerned that's

00:12:56.242 --> 00:13:00.780
going to happen. But -- >> That
would be to document hunting,

00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:05.785
right? >> People put guns on the
grounds these days, but I think

00:13:05.785 --> 00:13:10.890
it's also to do scouting for
game and fish. I think half a

00:13:10.890 --> 00:13:15.061
dozen states have passed laws or
proposed bills that would govern

00:13:15.061 --> 00:13:18.398
that sort of activity. There's
also some laws that actually

00:13:18.398 --> 00:13:23.336
prevent surveillance of hunters
while they're hunting. I think

00:13:23.336 --> 00:13:27.240
there's about two bills that are
on the table that prevent and

00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:31.444
prohibit one from using a drone
to surveil a hunter while

00:13:31.444 --> 00:13:34.547
they're in the process of
hunting. Those raise interesting

00:13:34.547 --> 00:13:38.451
questions and that might be
triggered by animal rights

00:13:38.451 --> 00:13:41.888
activists or fear that they
might use drones to monitor

00:13:41.888 --> 00:13:45.124
hunting patterns in people who
are hunting. Here's another

00:13:45.124 --> 00:13:48.227
interesting thing. On the left
you see a story from last week.

00:13:48.227 --> 00:13:54.233
A federal judge in Idaho struck
down this law that's called an

00:13:57.336 --> 00:14:00.306
ag-gag law. You might have heard
about these laws they've been

00:14:00.306 --> 00:14:05.078
passed pretty recently in a
handful of American states and

00:14:05.078 --> 00:14:09.048
they limit photography of
commercial agricultural

00:14:09.048 --> 00:14:13.886
facilities. So this includes
like poultry farms, places where

00:14:13.886 --> 00:14:17.623
cows are raised and stuff. A
federal judge last week said

00:14:17.623 --> 00:14:22.161
that that sort of law violated
the first amendment because it

00:14:22.161 --> 00:14:26.566
specifically carved out a type
of speech and a type of content

00:14:26.566 --> 00:14:30.002
and said it could not be
recorded. What's interesting is

00:14:30.002 --> 00:14:33.072
just a few months ago is the
State of Louisiana on the right

00:14:33.072 --> 00:14:36.342
passed a law that prohibits --
it requires if you want to use a

00:14:36.342 --> 00:14:39.278
drone to film one of these
facilities, you need to get a

00:14:39.278 --> 00:14:44.016
license from the state and it
has a few conditions. I think

00:14:44.016 --> 00:14:48.287
that the drone footage will
actually be owned by the

00:14:48.287 --> 00:14:52.558
commercial agricultural facility
once you take it, even if you

00:14:52.558 --> 00:14:55.661
have a license. And this is just
very interesting because

00:14:55.661 --> 00:14:58.731
licensing regimes and having to
ask the government for

00:14:58.731 --> 00:15:02.001
permission to speak kind of
raises the eyebrows of first

00:15:02.001 --> 00:15:05.772
amendment advocates. >> I think
what's really interesting too is

00:15:05.772 --> 00:15:08.341
that the bills being proposed
are actually about drones.

00:15:08.341 --> 00:15:11.444
They're not about the
application of drones or drones

00:15:11.444 --> 00:15:15.915
just being cameras that can be
in space. So I think we've seen

00:15:15.915 --> 00:15:19.719
some application of existing law
like tort law and privacy being

00:15:19.719 --> 00:15:23.489
applied to drones and when that
happens, we're sort of almost

00:15:23.489 --> 00:15:27.293
okay. Like I feel that's a
perfectly good use of an

00:15:27.293 --> 00:15:30.763
existing law. But there's a lot
of reactive rule making

00:15:30.763 --> 00:15:34.901
happening. >> I do want to
emphasize that there are a few

00:15:34.901 --> 00:15:38.004
laws being passed and bills
being proposed that are

00:15:38.004 --> 00:15:41.107
addressing the real privacy
harms, things like trespass with

00:15:41.107 --> 00:15:44.877
drones and where there were gaps
in the laws and that's

00:15:44.877 --> 00:15:48.381
absolutely legitimate to address
real privacy harms and places

00:15:48.381 --> 00:15:51.551
where your current laws are not
addressing those harms. What I'm

00:15:51.551 --> 00:15:53.853
focusing on here, what we're
focusing on here, are

00:15:53.853 --> 00:15:57.924
interesting kind of sectorial
use of legislation to get at the

00:15:57.924 --> 00:16:00.960
drone use question. And as you
can see lawmakers are still

00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:07.633
figure it out. Here's one
interesting one that is -- might

00:16:07.633 --> 00:16:10.570
remind people of a story from
last week. This is a law or a

00:16:10.570 --> 00:16:13.940
bill that's currently pending in
California that prohibits flying

00:16:13.940 --> 00:16:18.144
a drone over a state jail or
prison. And as folks may have

00:16:18.144 --> 00:16:23.216
heard last week in Ohio, there
was a story about a drone that

00:16:23.216 --> 00:16:27.119
was strapped with like 3 pounds
-- 3 ounces of marijuana, some

00:16:27.119 --> 00:16:31.424
heroin and some tobacco and they
dropped it over the prison and

00:16:31.424 --> 00:16:35.461
then a prison fight ensued.
(Laughter.) That was a real

00:16:35.461 --> 00:16:38.064
thing last week. And months
before that even happened in

00:16:38.064 --> 00:16:43.402
Ohio, California legislator was
thinking about a way that might

00:16:43.402 --> 00:16:45.972
happen and trying to write a
bill that would address that

00:16:45.972 --> 00:16:50.042
issue. Originally this bill also
prohibited photography of jails.

00:16:50.042 --> 00:16:54.814
The ACLU has raised some
concerns and that has been

00:16:54.814 --> 00:17:02.288
amended out of the bill. So
that's all to say that the

00:17:02.288 --> 00:17:08.361
privacy concerns are not new.
Privacy issues related to flight

00:17:08.361 --> 00:17:13.065
overhead are not new, and
policymakers, coders and

00:17:13.065 --> 00:17:17.003
legislators or excuse me,
judges, have had to address

00:17:17.003 --> 00:17:23.976
these questions before. This is
actually from a case in the

00:17:23.976 --> 00:17:26.579
early -- in the 1930s where a
homeowner sued united airlines

00:17:26.579 --> 00:17:32.885
and Pacific air transport
because planes were flying

00:17:32.885 --> 00:17:36.255
overhead. And the court in that
case had to figure out where do

00:17:36.255 --> 00:17:39.659
we draw the lines with this new
technology that's flying

00:17:39.659 --> 00:17:43.729
overhead. Does it make sense to
allow the homeowner to sue for

00:17:43.729 --> 00:17:47.567
trespass because somebody is
flying overhead. The lines have

00:17:47.567 --> 00:17:50.937
been adjusted before. And right
now we're in a moment where the

00:17:50.937 --> 00:17:55.641
courts, lawmakers and all these
entities are trying to figure

00:17:55.641 --> 00:18:00.179
out where the line should be
today. That brings us to the

00:18:00.179 --> 00:18:03.582
case of a Kentucky man. Eric,
you can talk about this Kentucky

00:18:03.582 --> 00:18:09.588
man if you want >> Yes. Somebody
in Kentucky shot a drone out of

00:18:09.588 --> 00:18:13.759
the sky using a shotgun, because
he said it was flying -- he said

00:18:13.759 --> 00:18:17.463
he was flying 10 feet over his
property and taking pictures of

00:18:17.463 --> 00:18:19.465
his daughter, something like
that. >> Yeah. >> And of course

00:18:19.465 --> 00:18:22.268
the media went nuts with this
and that was the story. And this

00:18:22.268 --> 00:18:27.740
has happened a few times in the
past. We've seen people shooting

00:18:27.740 --> 00:18:32.044
drones out of the air and it
leads to a lot of interesting

00:18:32.044 --> 00:18:36.749
discussions. >> Yeah. So this
guy was charged with criminal

00:18:36.749 --> 00:18:42.021
mischief, I believe, and wanton
endangerment. He claims that the

00:18:42.021 --> 00:18:45.591
drone was I think flying 10 feet
over the ground and that it was

00:18:45.591 --> 00:18:48.828
taking pictures of his daughter
and that it had been over his

00:18:48.828 --> 00:18:51.797
property or some other sort of
drone had been over his property

00:18:51.797 --> 00:18:59.171
multiple times. And he thinks
his privacy rights were violated

00:18:59.171 --> 00:19:02.575
because this drone was flying
over his property. And the law

00:19:02.575 --> 00:19:08.047
here is really unsettled right
now. As far as trespass goes,

00:19:08.047 --> 00:19:13.052
trespass law in Kentucky only
makes it a trespass if you go on

00:19:13.052 --> 00:19:17.423
to the property of somebody
else. Whether the drone at 10

00:19:17.423 --> 00:19:20.559
feet or 200 feet was on his
property, that's a question that

00:19:20.559 --> 00:19:22.762
the courts have been grappling
with for a while and they've

00:19:22.762 --> 00:19:26.298
drown different lines but not
really in the drone context yet.

00:19:26.298 --> 00:19:29.702
Sometimes folks will say that
sort of thing is a nuisance and

00:19:29.702 --> 00:19:33.372
it's possible if that drone had
flown over his property and

00:19:33.372 --> 00:19:38.978
interfered with his enjoyment of
the land, that there may be a

00:19:38.978 --> 00:19:42.615
nuisance tort claim there, but
even that is kind of an untested

00:19:42.615 --> 00:19:48.054
space right now. Whether or not
he can shoot that drone at all,

00:19:48.054 --> 00:19:52.291
I think the answer is probably
going to fall on the side of no,

00:19:52.291 --> 00:19:55.961
you cannot shoot a drone because
it's flying over your property.

00:19:55.961 --> 00:19:59.999
Unless that drone is threatening
your life or your safety and you

00:19:59.999 --> 00:20:04.503
really think it is. I think in
the same way that you can't burn

00:20:04.503 --> 00:20:06.772
your neighbor's car to the
ground when they park in your

00:20:06.772 --> 00:20:08.774
driveway, just because they
parked it there, that doesn't

00:20:08.774 --> 00:20:13.712
really make sense. That same
sort of does this make sense, is

00:20:13.712 --> 00:20:18.517
this reasonable thinking is
going to probably be applied to

00:20:18.517 --> 00:20:23.022
this space of drones. But
currently, because there's no

00:20:23.022 --> 00:20:25.958
laws that go one way or the
other clearly, and because he

00:20:25.958 --> 00:20:29.228
shot the drone, he's been
charged with some crimes, some

00:20:29.228 --> 00:20:33.499
very broad crimes, criminal
mischief under Kentucky law. >>

00:20:33.499 --> 00:20:35.501
There are a couple of issues I
want to bring up, whether a

00:20:35.501 --> 00:20:41.440
drone is an aircraft. This is
something that was decided in

00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:45.144
court in November by some
parties and they're saying yes

00:20:45.144 --> 00:20:48.647
it is an aircraft. You're not
allowed to shoot at aircraft, as

00:20:48.647 --> 00:20:51.951
far as I know. And so
potentially you wouldn't be

00:20:51.951 --> 00:20:57.123
allowed to shoot at a drone. And
those same parties, FAA, NTSB,

00:20:57.123 --> 00:20:59.825
would probably want to get
engaged with someone who shot at

00:20:59.825 --> 00:21:03.429
a drone, but we're hearing maybe
they don't want to be engaged. A

00:21:03.429 --> 00:21:08.067
lot of people are calling that
classification into question, is

00:21:08.067 --> 00:21:10.970
it an aircraft or is it not or
is it a third thing that doesn't

00:21:10.970 --> 00:21:15.641
exist yet. >> And will the NTSB
show up when this drone crashes

00:21:15.641 --> 00:21:18.978
and gets shot down because
there's been an air accident, or

00:21:18.978 --> 00:21:22.114
is it up to the states to decide
like how the law should

00:21:22.114 --> 00:21:25.818
intervene when this sort of like
conflict occurs. Right now

00:21:25.818 --> 00:21:30.356
states are either ad hoc finding
ways to address these issues, or

00:21:30.356 --> 00:21:33.659
they're proposing and passing
laws that would actually dry to

00:21:33.659 --> 00:21:35.961
address them. And there's going
to be conflicts going forward.

00:21:35.961 --> 00:21:38.998
I'm not sure we know what the
NTSB really is going to do in

00:21:38.998 --> 00:21:42.168
this space. One interesting
thing is how will we know what

00:21:42.168 --> 00:21:46.739
actually happened here. This is
a visual flight record that the

00:21:46.739 --> 00:21:51.110
operator of that Kentucky drone
produced from his iPad after the

00:21:51.110 --> 00:21:55.481
drone went down. So I'm
interested, Eric, I want to know

00:21:55.481 --> 00:21:59.818
how do we know in these
situations, how do we resolve

00:21:59.818 --> 00:22:01.754
conflicts. How do we know what
happened, what's being

00:22:01.754 --> 00:22:08.861
collected, that sort of thing.
>> Oh, convergence. >> You can

00:22:08.861 --> 00:22:13.799
shake my hand too. I need the
microphone. >> We have a

00:22:13.799 --> 00:22:20.839
tradition. With new speakers for
Def Con, we invite them to

00:22:20.839 --> 00:22:26.478
partake in a little bit of a
beverage. Hurry up, Paul. >>

00:22:26.478 --> 00:22:30.316
Would you let them talk about
drones which is really fucking

00:22:30.316 --> 00:22:37.790
cool. >> Drones are really
fucking cool. >> We'll keep

00:22:37.790 --> 00:22:43.062
going. >> So this is really
interesting. So the guy who flew

00:22:43.062 --> 00:22:47.166
the drone then produced his
flight log. And we're going to

00:22:47.166 --> 00:22:51.170
talk about logging and what that
means in this space in a second.

00:22:51.170 --> 00:22:54.740
And he showed his flight, what
he said was his flight over it.

00:22:54.740 --> 00:22:58.777
And perhaps he had never been
under 193 feet and never stopped

00:22:58.777 --> 00:23:02.548
over the property, and he was
able to show exactly when he

00:23:02.548 --> 00:23:07.486
flew over the property and for
how long. So now of course, of

00:23:07.486 --> 00:23:09.822
course since the media already
had the original story, nobody

00:23:09.822 --> 00:23:12.691
knows that. But this is the sort
of thing that could be used as

00:23:12.691 --> 00:23:16.195
evidence to show that maybe he
didn't do what the guy said. >>

00:23:16.195 --> 00:23:19.231
Yeah. And the fact that it was
200 feet over the ground

00:23:19.231 --> 00:23:21.600
potentially rather than just 10
feet over the ground might play

00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:26.805
into any sort of claim that he
would have that there was a

00:23:26.805 --> 00:23:29.508
trespass happening because
courts -- this is more

00:23:29.508 --> 00:23:35.147
interesting than courts.
(Laughter.) (Applause.) >> Are

00:23:35.147 --> 00:23:42.454
these guys doing a good job?
(Applause.) Somebody needs to

00:23:42.454 --> 00:23:47.860
get the drone a shot. I think
that's the loudest cheer for

00:23:47.860 --> 00:23:52.965
shot the new that I have heard
all weekend. So good job guys.

00:23:52.965 --> 00:23:58.737
>> Wow. There you go gentlemen.
You know how this works. To all

00:23:58.737 --> 00:24:04.677
the new attendees, to the new
speakers, welcome to Def Con.

00:24:07.413 --> 00:24:12.384
(Applause.) For the record, I
just tried to shoot the mic.

00:24:12.384 --> 00:24:15.888
(Laughter.) >> I'll be sure to
wipe it off. >> So at least if

00:24:15.888 --> 00:24:21.894
the operator -- sorry. If the
gentleman wanted to sue for

00:24:28.033 --> 00:24:31.370
trespass, it might matter that
there is actually evidence

00:24:31.370 --> 00:24:34.840
showing where exactly that drone
was in the sky. Not just

00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:38.344
geographically but the altitude
it was at and this is a more

00:24:38.344 --> 00:24:41.814
detailed version. >> I wanted to
show quickly what exactly gets

00:24:41.814 --> 00:24:45.384
logged. This is from the
perspective of DJI and I can

00:24:45.384 --> 00:24:49.154
talk about the greater industry
as well. But we have flight logs

00:24:49.154 --> 00:24:53.359
in part because users like
gamification. They want to see

00:24:53.359 --> 00:24:57.196
their flights, they want to be
able to go back and refer to

00:24:57.196 --> 00:24:59.531
where they've been flying. This
one on the right is a flight

00:24:59.531 --> 00:25:04.002
that I did not too long ago in
Italy and it shows this flight

00:25:04.002 --> 00:25:07.573
path along with where I took
pictures and it stores things

00:25:07.573 --> 00:25:09.575
like -- it also stories your
stick movements, which is

00:25:09.575 --> 00:25:13.812
interesting. So we're motivated
to store flight logs not only

00:25:13.812 --> 00:25:16.815
because users have asked for
this feature, but also because

00:25:16.815 --> 00:25:20.919
when someone says they had a
fly-away or the drone

00:25:20.919 --> 00:25:24.857
malfunctioned, we can take the
log data they submitted to us

00:25:24.857 --> 00:25:27.526
and look at it and actually see
where their sticks were. We can

00:25:27.526 --> 00:25:30.429
see exactly what they did during
flight to determine whether they

00:25:30.429 --> 00:25:32.765
did something or whether we did
something. And if it was

00:25:32.765 --> 00:25:36.468
something that we did, we'll fix
it. But if it was something that

00:25:36.468 --> 00:25:39.605
they did, they have to fix it.
>> I'm curious though where do

00:25:39.605 --> 00:25:43.108
the logs live and what level of
detail is there? So as like a

00:25:43.108 --> 00:25:46.678
privacy attorney I often wonder
where can governments go and

00:25:46.678 --> 00:25:50.716
where can civil litigants go if
there's a dispute and if

00:25:50.716 --> 00:25:53.052
government wants to put somebody
in jail for doing something, who

00:25:53.052 --> 00:25:56.188
do they demand this information
from, and what can they get from

00:25:56.188 --> 00:25:59.925
the drone owner and what can
they get from DJI. >> On our

00:25:59.925 --> 00:26:02.194
side we have two kinds of
logging. We have black box

00:26:02.194 --> 00:26:05.230
logging on board and that logs
pretty much everything. All the

00:26:05.230 --> 00:26:11.236
inputs in the system, including
I don't know voltages to RPMs of

00:26:15.073 --> 00:26:19.578
motors, battery cell monitoring,
that sort of thing. We do not

00:26:19.578 --> 00:26:23.615
transfer those back to the app
in real time. What you get here

00:26:23.615 --> 00:26:28.087
is essentially where you were.
So GPS coordinates, which I know

00:26:28.087 --> 00:26:31.890
is sensitive information,
altitude and what the user was

00:26:31.890 --> 00:26:35.060
doing with the sticks, for
example. And we have a cloud

00:26:35.060 --> 00:26:37.362
synch service so you can push it
up to the cloud if you would

00:26:37.362 --> 00:26:42.701
like, which is opt in. But I
think all of these issues are

00:26:42.701 --> 00:26:45.537
new. New for the industry
certainly certainly for consumer

00:26:45.537 --> 00:26:50.609
electronics and toys. Do you
want to do questions now?

00:26:50.609 --> 00:26:54.980
Because we have one here. >>
Sure. We'll take one real quick.

00:26:54.980 --> 00:27:00.919
>> We have not put that much
energy -- the question was about

00:27:08.460 --> 00:27:12.931
whether you can verify that this
data is accurate and whether

00:27:12.931 --> 00:27:16.935
it's forged and so the answer
is, you know, since we are

00:27:16.935 --> 00:27:20.105
essentially going from consumer
electronics, basically toying

00:27:20.105 --> 00:27:22.574
into something that's much more
useful, those are also useful

00:27:22.574 --> 00:27:25.911
questions. What you see in
traditional photography, for

00:27:25.911 --> 00:27:30.716
example, Canon will release a
product that allows you to sign

00:27:30.716 --> 00:27:33.485
images to prove that they're
authentic, but their normal

00:27:33.485 --> 00:27:36.121
cameras, even their professional
cameras do not have those

00:27:36.121 --> 00:27:38.323
features. So you're allowed to
go monkey with the data if you

00:27:38.323 --> 00:27:43.795
want. In other companies, like
say open source products, you

00:27:43.795 --> 00:27:46.098
have full access to the logs and
the full logs are often

00:27:46.098 --> 00:27:49.234
transferred to the radio because
it's totally open. There's no

00:27:49.234 --> 00:27:53.539
attempt to even encrypt it. I
think we're in the stage where

00:27:53.539 --> 00:27:56.575
you can find data that's
completely open, not protected,

00:27:56.575 --> 00:28:00.879
and then you can find companies
like DJI who are doing things as

00:28:00.879 --> 00:28:04.583
they become more and more
important due to numbers in the

00:28:04.583 --> 00:28:07.219
population. And of course some
just don't log at all. >> On

00:28:07.219 --> 00:28:12.758
this topic, some governments are
actually trying to address this

00:28:12.758 --> 00:28:17.429
issue of you know privacy and
the ability to shoot drones.

00:28:17.429 --> 00:28:20.732
This is an ordinance that was
put forward in a small Colorado

00:28:20.732 --> 00:28:25.037
town last year or earlier this
year actually. And it grants the

00:28:25.037 --> 00:28:29.508
right to engage, quote, engage a
drone or aerial vehicle if it's

00:28:29.508 --> 00:28:33.345
coming on to your property. It
reads a little bit like a day

00:28:33.345 --> 00:28:37.215
out of a tea partier's diary.
The FAA took it really

00:28:37.215 --> 00:28:40.185
seriously. They issued
statements saying that shooting

00:28:40.185 --> 00:28:46.592
drones is not okay because you
can't shoot aircraft. This

00:28:46.592 --> 00:28:49.561
ordinance has not moved forward.
There was actually another bill

00:28:49.561 --> 00:28:53.432
in Oklahoma this year that would
allow property owners to shoot

00:28:53.432 --> 00:28:58.003
drones just the same. That bill
is also dead now. So this is

00:28:58.003 --> 00:29:00.505
just to say like yet again
there's a gap in the law,

00:29:00.505 --> 00:29:02.741
there's a gap in where the
policy is and states and

00:29:02.741 --> 00:29:05.210
localities are trying to fill
that gap with their own

00:29:05.210 --> 00:29:08.914
proposals. >> There's actually
one that offered cash too if you

00:29:08.914 --> 00:29:15.087
shot one down. >> Right, right.
>> Question? >> How is it going?

00:29:15.087 --> 00:29:18.957
I'm actually from Oklahoma and I
am a 333 exempt -- I have 333

00:29:18.957 --> 00:29:22.894
exempt status. The question is
really to the attorney. If we

00:29:22.894 --> 00:29:27.366
have a DJI ma trees for example
and we're flying it for

00:29:27.366 --> 00:29:31.470
commercial use, it does have a
FN number with the FAA, how

00:29:31.470 --> 00:29:38.644
would the FAA classify that
drone? Would it be considered an

00:29:38.644 --> 00:29:41.279
aircraft at that point and how
would they classify other

00:29:41.279 --> 00:29:44.750
aircraft that are shot at. >> So
your question was if you take a

00:29:44.750 --> 00:29:47.819
drone that is certified for
commercial uses and you fly it

00:29:47.819 --> 00:29:53.191
for non-commercial uses? >>
During commercial engagement, if

00:29:53.191 --> 00:29:55.661
somebody was to shoot at our
drone that is classified with

00:29:55.661 --> 00:29:59.898
the FAA with the FN number, tail
number and all that stuff, you

00:29:59.898 --> 00:30:01.900
mentioned earlier that nobody
really knows if they're

00:30:01.900 --> 00:30:04.503
classified as aircraft or not,
if it is classified with them as

00:30:04.503 --> 00:30:10.709
an aircraft, what does the law
state about shooting an aircraft

00:30:10.709 --> 00:30:14.046
that is -- besides drones, I'm
sorry, I'm confusing. If

00:30:14.046 --> 00:30:17.049
somebody was to shoot at an
airplane what would happen to

00:30:17.049 --> 00:30:22.721
them. >> I'm not super aware of
the shooting drone precedent law

00:30:22.721 --> 00:30:26.825
-- it doesn't actually exist.
The current regulations, I know

00:30:26.825 --> 00:30:29.227
the FAA regulations they don't
actually provide for what would

00:30:29.227 --> 00:30:33.532
happen if one shoots at a drone
specifically. But my

00:30:33.532 --> 00:30:35.801
understanding is our current
longstanding FAA rules are going

00:30:35.801 --> 00:30:40.505
to apply in that sort of
situation if one endangers an

00:30:40.505 --> 00:30:44.976
aircraft or something like that.
But I haven't seen this actually

00:30:44.976 --> 00:30:49.481
be adjudicated. The FAA has gone
after folks joyriding with their

00:30:49.481 --> 00:30:53.952
drones and there's been case law
created around that, but there

00:30:53.952 --> 00:30:58.223
hasn't been, as far as I'm
aware, specific dispute that

00:30:58.223 --> 00:31:01.026
someone has decided in that
context. >> Eric, do you have

00:31:01.026 --> 00:31:04.796
more on that? I think we can
assume it's not going to be okay

00:31:04.796 --> 00:31:07.799
and the FAA is going to find a
way to make it not under the

00:31:07.799 --> 00:31:11.002
law. They'll just say it's
illegal if someone does that. >>

00:31:11.002 --> 00:31:16.208
Another question? >> Sure. >> I
was just curious when you're

00:31:16.208 --> 00:31:19.244
seeing these policies being
created, are you seeing more on

00:31:19.244 --> 00:31:24.850
the end of the privacy side or
are you seeing more towards the

00:31:24.850 --> 00:31:28.553
rights of the drone operators?
>> Seeing it more on the privacy

00:31:28.553 --> 00:31:31.123
side actually. We haven't really
focused on the many bills out

00:31:31.123 --> 00:31:35.026
there that are kind of extending
traditional privacy law into

00:31:35.026 --> 00:31:40.432
this space. There's multiple
bills that are saying you can't

00:31:40.432 --> 00:31:45.070
be a peeping Tom but with a
drone. You can't trespass on to

00:31:45.070 --> 00:31:47.672
somebody's property but with a
drone. What we're focusing on

00:31:47.672 --> 00:31:50.742
are those bills that are getting
at privacy issues or just

00:31:50.742 --> 00:31:54.946
sectors of the economy. With
often a privacy interest in the

00:31:54.946 --> 00:31:57.849
mix, but they're sweeping in a
different direction a lot of the

00:31:57.849 --> 00:32:02.454
time. >> So this brings us to
our next case study. This is

00:32:02.454 --> 00:32:05.824
from January of this year. Do
you want to chat about this? >>

00:32:05.824 --> 00:32:10.395
I don't know if I want to, but I
will. A phantom, I think it was

00:32:10.395 --> 00:32:16.868
an original phantom, ended up on
the White House lawn. And this

00:32:16.868 --> 00:32:22.541
obviously caused a huge uproar.
And I think what -- I mean, I'm

00:32:22.541 --> 00:32:25.076
not sure that the details are
actually that clear, but what we

00:32:25.076 --> 00:32:28.547
understand, what we have been
told by media mostly, is that a

00:32:28.547 --> 00:32:33.852
government employee was drunk
and flew it out of his apartment

00:32:33.852 --> 00:32:38.323
window or flew a friend's quad
copter out of the window,

00:32:38.323 --> 00:32:44.329
probably lost contact and then
it decided to go home, wherever

00:32:46.565 --> 00:32:51.603
home was and probably lost power
on the way and unfortunately

00:32:51.603 --> 00:32:57.843
ended up on the lawn. So, yes.
>> And we have a Def Con first.

00:32:57.843 --> 00:33:03.782
We have a re-creation of that
day. >> There we go. We could do

00:33:05.817 --> 00:33:07.819
it with the bigger one. >> You
need another shot first, I

00:33:07.819 --> 00:33:12.657
think. >> Where's the lawn
though? Yeah, right. (Applause.)

00:33:12.657 --> 00:33:18.663
That's the White House right
there >> Secret service. Go for

00:33:21.967 --> 00:33:27.973
it. >> Everyone jump on it. >>
Okay. Thank you for that.

00:33:32.110 --> 00:33:38.116
(Laughter.) >> Okay. Could
somebody get the drone? >> There

00:33:40.552 --> 00:33:46.558
we go. There we go. Yay. All
right. (Applause.) >> So what

00:33:49.694 --> 00:33:53.265
was DJI's response to this? >>
Our response, which actually

00:33:53.265 --> 00:33:56.835
started -- so there's the public
perception of what happened and

00:33:56.835 --> 00:34:02.374
what was going on behind the
scenes. So our response was to

00:34:02.374 --> 00:34:08.680
make pretty much all of DC a
no-fly zone. And that caused

00:34:08.680 --> 00:34:13.285
mostly hobbyists to perhaps not
be so happy. But actually that

00:34:13.285 --> 00:34:17.122
whole area is already a no-fly
zone. Because it's critical.

00:34:17.122 --> 00:34:20.992
Critical infrastructure, it
could probably be classified as

00:34:20.992 --> 00:34:25.730
that. And those are the same
rules that if you were flying a

00:34:25.730 --> 00:34:30.368
private aircraft, you would have
to abide by. So that had not

00:34:30.368 --> 00:34:35.206
made it into DJI's no-fly
feature set. So what we had done

00:34:35.206 --> 00:34:39.611
not long before was make it very
difficult to fly near an

00:34:39.611 --> 00:34:44.549
airport. Not the five miles that
FAA had talked about, but we had

00:34:44.549 --> 00:34:46.918
some kind of fall-off for
maximum altitude and you're

00:34:46.918 --> 00:34:50.522
grounded at a certain radius
around major airports. It's

00:34:50.522 --> 00:34:54.960
important to note that these
features, the geofencing is not

00:34:54.960 --> 00:34:58.229
necessarily intended to prevent
bad actors from doing things.

00:34:58.229 --> 00:35:01.967
It's right now not that
difficult to buy another brand,

00:35:01.967 --> 00:35:06.671
fly without GPS. In the long
term GPS is unlikely to be the

00:35:06.671 --> 00:35:10.909
primary and only form of
positioning. There's visual

00:35:10.909 --> 00:35:12.911
positioning, there are all sorts
of things that are being

00:35:12.911 --> 00:35:15.113
developed right now that would
serve as redundancy and would

00:35:15.113 --> 00:35:19.284
serve as alternate methods of
navigation. So these no-fly

00:35:19.284 --> 00:35:22.053
zones right now were done pro
actively to really prevent

00:35:22.053 --> 00:35:25.590
people who maybe didn't know
they should be flying in the

00:35:25.590 --> 00:35:29.928
middle of DC, for example, or
close to an airport from doing

00:35:29.928 --> 00:35:34.699
it on accident. >> I think your
point about is the restrictions

00:35:34.699 --> 00:35:37.669
that you've placed or that
you've placed on like geofencing

00:35:37.669 --> 00:35:44.876
in this case, there's often talk
of DRM on devices people own and

00:35:44.876 --> 00:35:47.946
not allowing computers to be
general purpose computers. And I

00:35:47.946 --> 00:35:52.851
think when folks advocate for
more restrictions like this, be

00:35:52.851 --> 00:35:56.688
it on a drone or on a computer
that I own or a car that I own,

00:35:56.688 --> 00:35:59.591
I think it's important to
remember like, and this is

00:35:59.591 --> 00:36:01.860
something that policy makers
especially at the state level

00:36:01.860 --> 00:36:04.496
need to be aware of, is that
when you're going after the bad

00:36:04.496 --> 00:36:07.799
actors and you're creating the
restrictions to get at the bad

00:36:07.799 --> 00:36:11.236
actors, those folks are going to
be the folks to be smart enough

00:36:11.236 --> 00:36:13.772
to do what they need to do that
these restrictions aren't going

00:36:13.772 --> 00:36:18.977
to matter. It should inform, it
should continue 20 inform the

00:36:18.977 --> 00:36:24.883
way these sorts of restrictions
are talked about and debated at

00:36:24.883 --> 00:36:29.020
both the company level and at
the policymaker level. One thing

00:36:29.020 --> 00:36:31.423
that's really interesting I
think is there's often this talk

00:36:31.423 --> 00:36:34.526
of I won't know who owns the
drone that's right outside my

00:36:34.526 --> 00:36:38.863
window. I won't know whose drone
landed in the White House lawn.

00:36:38.863 --> 00:36:42.500
What sorts of methods of
attribution are being pro pieced

00:36:42.500 --> 00:36:45.904
right now to make that
connection. What's possible? >>

00:36:45.904 --> 00:36:52.110
What's possible. We at DJI
specifically requires activation

00:36:52.110 --> 00:36:54.546
of new product in the same way
that an iPhone does, for

00:36:54.546 --> 00:36:58.049
example. And this is not
something that all companies are

00:36:58.049 --> 00:37:01.920
doing in this space, but I think
as companies grow up, they sort

00:37:01.920 --> 00:37:07.225
of realize that we need to do
something to help users, and to

00:37:07.225 --> 00:37:13.364
help us to figure out who's
liable, but also author some

00:37:13.364 --> 00:37:16.534
features that might be useful
and customers can make the

00:37:16.534 --> 00:37:21.072
decision about which one to buy.
We have an activation, it's to

00:37:21.072 --> 00:37:26.010
an e-mail address. >> Could I
use a proxy like web address? >>

00:37:26.010 --> 00:37:30.782
You could use a proxy. You can
use anything you want. And the

00:37:30.782 --> 00:37:33.551
other thing we have is serial
number data. It's loosely

00:37:33.551 --> 00:37:39.757
connected to how it was sold. We
don't necessarily know who it

00:37:39.757 --> 00:37:42.627
was unless they registered but
we might know what dealer

00:37:42.627 --> 00:37:47.265
purchased it. Historically we've
gotten a couple of requests. We

00:37:47.265 --> 00:37:52.403
haven't gotten any super high
profile ones and have so far

00:37:52.403 --> 00:37:55.273
been operating based on
subpoena, like a lot of

00:37:55.273 --> 00:37:58.743
companies do. >> Right. But as
more information, your newest

00:37:58.743 --> 00:38:04.048
model allows for streaming video
into both YouTube and also into

00:38:04.048 --> 00:38:07.819
your cloud. So there's going to
be developing questions of

00:38:07.819 --> 00:38:12.157
whether and how law enforcement
can gain access or litigants who

00:38:12.157 --> 00:38:15.059
want to sue their neighbor for
trespassing, there's going to be

00:38:15.059 --> 00:38:19.164
questions about what sort of
content is available too and

00:38:19.164 --> 00:38:23.368
what sort of sensitive metadata
is available as well. Another

00:38:23.368 --> 00:38:28.373
thing I had a question about is
was the initial firmware update

00:38:28.373 --> 00:38:32.076
mandatory and are firmware
updates mandatory and how did

00:38:32.076 --> 00:38:36.481
that play out. >> We had a brief
period in which we had a

00:38:36.481 --> 00:38:39.751
mandatory firm wear update but
we made them all optional

00:38:39.751 --> 00:38:43.721
quickly. So right now they are
optional. So if we add something

00:38:43.721 --> 00:38:47.659
that users don't like, they can
choose not to update. And we

00:38:47.659 --> 00:38:50.929
will be annoying about it and
tell uh-uh should probably

00:38:50.929 --> 00:38:54.232
update. There's a red thing that
flashes pretty much constantly

00:38:54.232 --> 00:38:58.503
but we don't force people 20 do
it. The question is if we patch

00:38:58.503 --> 00:39:03.875
something that was a bug -- >>
Yeah, what if there's a security

00:39:03.875 --> 00:39:06.377
vulnerability. >> Then who's
liable? Are we liable because

00:39:06.377 --> 00:39:10.148
the user didn't upgrade? These
are all questions I'm not sure.

00:39:10.148 --> 00:39:12.150
>> Right now it's voluntary. >>
The patch would not come, they

00:39:12.150 --> 00:39:14.552
wouldn't get the patch without
the firmware update in complete

00:39:14.552 --> 00:39:21.559
form. >> Correct. >> So this is
another -- you can explain this.

00:39:21.559 --> 00:39:25.330
>> This is interesting. There's
a whole software economy, we'll

00:39:25.330 --> 00:39:28.399
get into this later if we have
time. This is a screen shot of

00:39:28.399 --> 00:39:36.007
an app called air map which has
set out to basically map all of

00:39:36.007 --> 00:39:38.977
these areas that might be a
problem for flight. So whether

00:39:38.977 --> 00:39:41.179
you're flying recreationally or
commercially. So you can

00:39:41.179 --> 00:39:44.382
basically toggle on and off
airports of different kinds,

00:39:44.382 --> 00:39:47.051
whether you're operating
commercially or as a hobby.

00:39:47.051 --> 00:39:52.891
Heliports, things that you might
not know about. We're seeing

00:39:52.891 --> 00:39:57.829
some companies grow up around
no-fly compliance safety, and

00:39:57.829 --> 00:40:00.198
it's very likely that we'll
start to see a lot more

00:40:00.198 --> 00:40:03.067
integration between
manufacturers who may not want

00:40:03.067 --> 00:40:06.304
to do this themselves or may,
and companies like this. So

00:40:06.304 --> 00:40:10.408
right now you have to check this
yourself and determine whether

00:40:10.408 --> 00:40:13.778
you can fly there. But going
forward I think there could be a

00:40:13.778 --> 00:40:19.751
lot more integration. >> And so
this is just getting on to other

00:40:19.751 --> 00:40:24.455
sorts of no-fly zones of recent
vintage. The one on the left is

00:40:24.455 --> 00:40:28.393
the letter that the ACLU sent to
the FAA last fall during the

00:40:28.393 --> 00:40:34.832
protests in Ferguson. There was
an ad hoc no-fly zone was issued

00:40:34.832 --> 00:40:38.469
by the FAA that prohibited fly
around this area over Ferguson.

00:40:38.469 --> 00:40:41.439
And the ACLU raised a serious
first amendment concerns with

00:40:41.439 --> 00:40:44.709
that sort of restriction where
it wasn't based on a compelling

00:40:44.709 --> 00:40:47.912
need to protect officer safety
on the ground and that no-fly

00:40:47.912 --> 00:40:51.649
zone would have applied to both
traditional aircraft and to

00:40:51.649 --> 00:40:55.653
drones. There's an interesting
one you told me about last week,

00:40:55.653 --> 00:40:58.890
Eric, that relates to burning
man. >> I went last year to do

00:40:58.890 --> 00:41:05.363
live streaming to the burning
man you-stream channel and this

00:41:05.363 --> 00:41:09.967
year BLM has gotten a lot more
aggressive about restricting

00:41:09.967 --> 00:41:13.938
drone use altogether. So they've
come to an agreement with

00:41:13.938 --> 00:41:18.343
basically an application process
based on merit. So you submit an

00:41:18.343 --> 00:41:22.947
application to fly a drone at
burning man and it could be

00:41:22.947 --> 00:41:26.851
based on artistic intent or
media coverage and they have

00:41:26.851 --> 00:41:30.254
categories and lots of rules and
they're going to issue 30 of

00:41:30.254 --> 00:41:33.725
them. I think the day it opened
-- I think the first day someone

00:41:33.725 --> 00:41:38.563
I know applied he was on the
waiting list as number 400. So

00:41:38.563 --> 00:41:42.266
there's certainly been demand.
There were rules set up and

00:41:42.266 --> 00:41:46.004
everybody ignored them. So it's
sort of hard. What's interesting

00:41:46.004 --> 00:41:50.842
is that's a little model of
what's going on in the U.S., for

00:41:50.842 --> 00:41:53.811
example. Blanket no commercial
operations and sections 333

00:41:53.811 --> 00:41:57.482
exemptions being granted and at
this smaller level you see that

00:41:57.482 --> 00:42:02.620
same thing happen. >> You see
both no-fly zones at the

00:42:02.620 --> 00:42:06.391
manufacturer level, also at the
ad hoc governmental level and

00:42:06.391 --> 00:42:09.861
then private groups of people
are deciding when and where

00:42:09.861 --> 00:42:13.431
drones should fly. That's just
to say it's not entirely clear

00:42:13.431 --> 00:42:16.667
yet where these decisions are
going to be made about who can

00:42:16.667 --> 00:42:19.370
fly drones and where. The
authorities are in flux right

00:42:19.370 --> 00:42:22.640
now and it's interesting that
everyone is filling the gaps.

00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:26.811
There was actually a bill last
year, so state legislature is

00:42:26.811 --> 00:42:29.914
also concerned about
infrastructure. There was a bill

00:42:29.914 --> 00:42:33.451
earlier this year in fact that
prohibited photography of

00:42:33.451 --> 00:42:37.221
critical infrastructure in the
State of New Jersey. The ACLU

00:42:37.221 --> 00:42:40.224
raised first amendment concerns
with this because critical

00:42:40.224 --> 00:42:45.797
infrastructure could mean
anything including toll booths

00:42:45.797 --> 00:42:49.901
and it was so vaguely defined
that it swept into the rights of

00:42:49.901 --> 00:42:52.737
people to collect information
and to disseminate that

00:42:52.737 --> 00:42:56.741
information. So states are
getting at this from their own

00:42:56.741 --> 00:43:00.278
angle, but it's not only with
regards to flight restrictions.

00:43:00.278 --> 00:43:04.415
It might be they're trying to
prevent terrorists, quote

00:43:04.415 --> 00:43:07.885
unquote terrorists from taking
photos from toll booths or

00:43:07.885 --> 00:43:11.756
bridges or nuclear power plants.
>> And this is all going to get

00:43:11.756 --> 00:43:16.060
even more interesting. Because
what's happening now is we're

00:43:16.060 --> 00:43:20.598
starting to see drones become a
platform for developers. That

00:43:20.598 --> 00:43:23.701
might be of particular interest
here. But there's an application

00:43:23.701 --> 00:43:28.039
layer now that would be
basically the same as what we

00:43:28.039 --> 00:43:32.376
saw on the smart phone world.
Drones will become a platform

00:43:32.376 --> 00:43:35.913
for vertical or horizontal
applications to be written by

00:43:35.913 --> 00:43:40.251
third parties. And so some of
the first examples we're seeing

00:43:40.251 --> 00:43:43.421
are things like mapping,
photogrammetry, kind of standard

00:43:43.421 --> 00:43:47.492
aerial imaging when data is
being used. We're seeing 3 D

00:43:47.492 --> 00:43:50.828
mapping and 2-D mapping and
using all sorts of different

00:43:50.828 --> 00:43:55.566
kinds of cameras mostly for
agriculture, mining, utility

00:43:55.566 --> 00:43:58.035
inspection, those sorts of
things, commercial operations.

00:43:58.035 --> 00:44:01.005
But we're also seeing some
creative tools, things that

00:44:01.005 --> 00:44:04.909
cinematographers might want. If
you want a very beautiful flight

00:44:04.909 --> 00:44:08.012
around your house, there are
some apps coming online in the

00:44:08.012 --> 00:44:12.049
next few months that will allow
you to plan and preview them

00:44:12.049 --> 00:44:15.686
using 3-D environments instead
of using apple maps. And you

00:44:15.686 --> 00:44:17.989
play it back and your drone
takes off and does that same

00:44:17.989 --> 00:44:24.829
flight and it's repeatable. So
if that happens, do we just get

00:44:24.829 --> 00:44:28.065
terms of service, like when
you're on iTunes there's a

00:44:28.065 --> 00:44:32.403
73-page thing or you have terms
of service for the platform and

00:44:32.403 --> 00:44:34.505
the app. >> And you're going to
be like no, that guy is liable,

00:44:34.505 --> 00:44:38.809
no, that guy is liable. And as
you have more players in this

00:44:38.809 --> 00:44:41.012
ecosystem there's going to be a
lot more collection of

00:44:41.012 --> 00:44:44.315
information and no longer is
there going to be an SD card

00:44:44.315 --> 00:44:48.052
living on the drone, there's
going to be footage streamed to

00:44:48.052 --> 00:44:53.658
YouTube potentially or DJI's
cloud and also a bunch of apps

00:44:53.658 --> 00:44:56.294
out there who are collecting
information say for real estate

00:44:56.294 --> 00:45:01.098
purposes or to survey property.
So if you think of security,

00:45:01.098 --> 00:45:03.100
there are going to be a lot more
actors who have touch points to

00:45:03.100 --> 00:45:05.102
that data and there's going to
be a lot more ways potentially

00:45:05.102 --> 00:45:08.105
that that data can be
compromised and accessed by

00:45:08.105 --> 00:45:11.042
third parties. So it's
interesting. And I think we can

00:45:11.042 --> 00:45:17.048
maybe take another question if
someone has another question? >>

00:45:23.254 --> 00:45:27.425
Fascinating talk. I want to
thank you. So in the early '90s,

00:45:27.425 --> 00:45:30.094
or maybe mid '90s, in the
northeast, I want to say New

00:45:30.094 --> 00:45:36.033
York, there was a case where
wildlife photographers posted

00:45:36.033 --> 00:45:39.904
autonomous cameras, the hunting
cameras that are motion

00:45:39.904 --> 00:45:44.008
activated on private property.
Property owner found the

00:45:44.008 --> 00:45:47.445
cameras, destroyed the cameras.
The photographers went and said

00:45:47.445 --> 00:45:50.147
hey we have every right to
photograph these beautiful deer

00:45:50.147 --> 00:45:54.085
whatever and the courts
disagreed and said no, you put

00:45:54.085 --> 00:45:56.921
free stuff on someone's property
they have an absolute right to

00:45:56.921 --> 00:46:03.227
deal with it in any manner they
so choose. The drone question

00:46:03.227 --> 00:46:06.931
then with respect to private
property and the photography of

00:46:06.931 --> 00:46:10.968
private property, regardless of
what's on it, whether it's your

00:46:10.968 --> 00:46:16.540
daughter, a deer or a blade of
grass, seems to hinge on is the

00:46:16.540 --> 00:46:21.779
drone on private property. So
the question is, have you seen a

00:46:21.779 --> 00:46:25.783
revision or a set of cases that
look at the revision of property

00:46:25.783 --> 00:46:30.321
rights definition, meaning air
rights definition? How high do

00:46:30.321 --> 00:46:33.991
my air rights go? Is it 30 feet?
100 feet or do I have it like

00:46:33.991 --> 00:46:38.029
sovereign nations do into space?
>> Yeah, like we were saying

00:46:38.029 --> 00:46:40.231
earlier. Courts have had to
grapple with that before as

00:46:40.231 --> 00:46:43.467
commercial airliners started
flying over people's houses and

00:46:43.467 --> 00:46:47.571
say you lived in the path of the
local airport area, courts have

00:46:47.571 --> 00:46:52.543
had to move those lines around
before. Where the law has

00:46:52.543 --> 00:46:56.547
shifted in the trespass sense
towards lower to the ground is

00:46:56.547 --> 00:47:01.085
where your property rights end.
Drones are different and drones

00:47:01.085 --> 00:47:04.922
can fly and get into private
property in ways that

00:47:04.922 --> 00:47:07.491
traditional airplanes and
helicopters couldn't. So it

00:47:07.491 --> 00:47:11.028
wouldn't be a surprise if the
policy makers had to readjust

00:47:11.028 --> 00:47:14.332
the lines again. It's all in
flux. >> I have seen a lot of

00:47:14.332 --> 00:47:17.601
discussion about it but no real
proposals for how it might

00:47:17.601 --> 00:47:23.207
change. And mostly again it's
around commercial use of drones.

00:47:23.207 --> 00:47:28.879
Which is not -- certainly not
close to the numbers that are

00:47:28.879 --> 00:47:33.017
being used in hobby. So here's
an interesting fact, I guess.

00:47:33.017 --> 00:47:37.922
National parks have banned
drones. So there's an open

00:47:37.922 --> 00:47:41.759
question about whether you can
take off across the street from

00:47:41.759 --> 00:47:45.062
a national park and fly into the
national park. They can

00:47:45.062 --> 00:47:47.932
certainly prevent you from
launching from the ground, but

00:47:47.932 --> 00:47:50.868
they're not sure where does the
air space start. I think

00:47:50.868 --> 00:47:55.172
according to FAA it's at 0. You
don't own any of your airspace.

00:47:55.172 --> 00:48:00.544
These are things that are all in
flux and we hear discussions

00:48:00.544 --> 00:48:05.516
constantly about them. >> Thanks
for having us today. >> Thanks

00:48:05.516 --> 00:48:07.518
so much. (Applause.)
