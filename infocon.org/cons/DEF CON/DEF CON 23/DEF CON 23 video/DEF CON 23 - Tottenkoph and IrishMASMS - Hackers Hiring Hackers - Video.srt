00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.642
 Who is excited? Who has been up
since like yesterday? Yeah! So

00:00:08.642 --> 00:00:11.912
welcome to our talk. Hackers
hiring hackers, how to do things

00:00:11.912 --> 00:00:18.318
better. A key component of the
talk is presentation, so you can

00:00:18.318 --> 00:00:26.193
ask questions and raise your
hand. We want you to share your

00:00:26.193 --> 00:00:31.131
war stories. Ask questions at
any given point. If you think

00:00:31.131 --> 00:00:35.402
we're giving you complete
bullshit, let us know. Be

00:00:35.402 --> 00:00:38.805
respectful about it but that is
the great thing about DEFCON. We

00:00:38.805 --> 00:00:46.246
can talk bull shit and then talk
about it. >> [indiscernible] >>

00:00:46.246 --> 00:00:52.252
But not literally. So the way
that Irish and I came up with

00:00:54.388 --> 00:00:59.793
this talk was I was in his area
for work and we met up and we

00:00:59.793 --> 00:01:04.364
were drinking and eating and we
started talking about how bad

00:01:04.364 --> 00:01:11.138
things were trying to find a job
in -- even for those that had

00:01:11.138 --> 00:01:18.111
been there for a while, let
alone the newbies. >> Whose

00:01:18.111 --> 00:01:25.585
first DEFCON is this? That is?
How many hiring managers do we

00:01:25.585 --> 00:01:33.093
have today? How many of you are
currently looking for people to

00:01:33.093 --> 00:01:38.932
hire? Nice. And how many newly
graduated, looking for your

00:01:38.932 --> 00:01:42.469
first InfoSec gig. How many of
you are curious of just what is

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:48.475
going on? Okay. Nothing else
better to do. >> This talk was

00:01:59.853 --> 00:02:06.960
not done with any consent by
current, future, past, present

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:12.966
employers. This is just Totten
and myself expressing our

00:02:30.584 --> 00:02:35.088
frustrations and how we can do
better as hiring managers and

00:02:35.088 --> 00:02:38.625
how we can do better. You can
read the legalese there, this is

00:02:38.625 --> 00:02:44.631
just us talking. I'll let you
guess which picture respects

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:52.906
which one of us. [indiscernible]
this costs extra. Who here is a

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:05.719
human? >> We're trying to figure
out the mics, it's okay. Yeah.

00:03:15.662 --> 00:03:19.666
We're both currently in
information security industry.

00:03:19.666 --> 00:03:26.006
I'm a security consultant with
rapid 7. I basically do training

00:03:26.006 --> 00:03:32.012
ask deployment. Irish, what do
you do? >> Blue team protection

00:03:34.181 --> 00:03:38.785
and currently working as the
director of research. Why are we

00:03:38.785 --> 00:03:46.159
talking about this? Why would we
have this conversation at

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:51.698
DEFCON? There is a lot of sexy
talks about how to phone this

00:03:51.698 --> 00:03:56.236
and phone that and put these
things together but there are

00:03:56.236 --> 00:04:02.576
very few that address the human
element. This is also an

00:04:02.576 --> 00:04:06.279
engineering exercise. If you
want to look at it and put it in

00:04:06.279 --> 00:04:11.017
that context. How do we get
people hired? How do we get

00:04:11.017 --> 00:04:14.888
people entrusted in our roles?
How do I get that right resume

00:04:14.888 --> 00:04:20.894
to get in this role? To get that
next opportunity. And both of us

00:04:24.631 --> 00:04:28.235
have not be doing a very good
job of this. And we'll have some

00:04:28.235 --> 00:04:35.809
examples later, actually.We're
doing a poor time in

00:04:35.809 --> 00:04:40.814
communicating our expectations
of the job, we're going to

00:04:40.814 --> 00:04:45.285
interviews without knowing how
to showcase our experience and

00:04:45.285 --> 00:04:50.323
how to posture ourselves in
trying to represent who we are.

00:04:53.226 --> 00:04:56.530
What can we do and how can we
reduce that risk for the

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:01.535
organization? And from a hiring
management perspective,

00:05:01.535 --> 00:05:04.604
sometimes we get those
applicants, we don't get a

00:05:04.604 --> 00:05:12.078
feeling that they're interested.
>> From the top secret

00:05:12.078 --> 00:05:18.084
perspective, hackers, either new
or experienced, we're getting

00:05:18.084 --> 00:05:24.090
frustrated because we don't --
we don't know exactly what

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:30.864
they're looking for, right. The
descriptions are ambiguous. We

00:05:30.864 --> 00:05:34.935
go in, they tell us there is no
hackers to hire and they really

00:05:34.935 --> 00:05:39.339
want a hacker and then we show
up with your experience and with

00:05:39.339 --> 00:05:41.942
our willingness to learn and we
feel like we're getting shut

00:05:41.942 --> 00:05:48.548
down for no good reason. >> And
how many of us have heard, it's

00:05:48.548 --> 00:05:54.554
hard to find people to hire?
(lost audio connection). >>

00:06:04.331 --> 00:06:09.269
Sorry for the technical
difficulties, folks. Hard to

00:06:09.269 --> 00:06:11.805
find people to hire. We scare
the folks that we're trying to

00:06:11.805 --> 00:06:16.476
interview or talk with. Scare
recruiters and we're teaching

00:06:16.476 --> 00:06:24.150
ourselves in this process. And
getting retaining talent is a

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:27.387
social engineering exercise. How
is it a social engineering

00:06:27.387 --> 00:06:31.558
science? From a hiring manager
perspective, just finding people

00:06:31.558 --> 00:06:35.295
interested in the role and
getting them to apply. Getting

00:06:35.295 --> 00:06:38.932
upper management approval for
the role. Getting a description

00:06:38.932 --> 00:06:46.439
that they will let get posted on
the website. Let's not forget,

00:06:46.439 --> 00:06:50.510
once you get them in that role,
being able to nurture that

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:54.180
candidate so they grow
personally and professionally

00:06:54.180 --> 00:07:00.620
and they want to stay and help
others and yourself grow. How

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:04.557
can we be better hackers,
helping each other out? From the

00:07:04.557 --> 00:07:10.563
job hunters perspective, writing
a convincing resume, a cover

00:07:14.401 --> 00:07:18.071
letter that expresses why I want
this job. Why am I looking for a

00:07:18.071 --> 00:07:23.910
new role. Getting through the
interview process. Not just with

00:07:23.910 --> 00:07:26.646
the hiring managers but with the
other team leads that we have to

00:07:26.646 --> 00:07:30.150
talk with and get their input.
And the folks that we're going

00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:37.590
to be working with in that role.
Getting and negotiating a

00:07:37.590 --> 00:07:39.592
suitable offer and showing up on
day one and getting

00:07:44.831 --> 00:07:50.837
[indiscernible]. >> Again,
apologies for the technical

00:07:57.877 --> 00:08:03.817
difficulties. So expectations.
This is one of the -- we broke

00:08:07.387 --> 00:08:11.124
it down to four different core
problems or core opportunities

00:08:11.124 --> 00:08:19.065
to improve. There is nobody to
hire. Oh, but hey you want to

00:08:19.065 --> 00:08:23.837
work in a comfy office with a 6
month contract to fire just like

00:08:23.837 --> 00:08:28.608
[indiscernible]. Because we've
never gotten those calls before,

00:08:28.608 --> 00:08:34.013
right? There are folks to hire,
just not in your market, not

00:08:34.013 --> 00:08:37.117
your salary range, and not with
the requirements that you have.

00:08:37.117 --> 00:08:42.222
What do you need to do? Set and
adjust your expectations from

00:08:42.222 --> 00:08:48.228
both sides of the team and
nurturing the team that you

00:08:50.930 --> 00:08:54.801
have. -- talks about, in a
series of blog posts and I

00:08:54.801 --> 00:08:57.370
wanted to stick this in. Hiring
the unhire able. There are folks

00:08:57.370 --> 00:09:03.309
to hire. We got to set our
expectations appropriate to the

00:09:09.749 --> 00:09:16.890
organization, what you need and
what's available out there. So,

00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:22.061
what do you want? I want a
junior level or entry level

00:09:22.061 --> 00:09:28.067
person. Hey, they need at least
five years of experience. What?

00:09:33.807 --> 00:09:39.079
Bingo. Because, right. Now it's
again setting that expectation.

00:09:39.079 --> 00:09:44.017
What things can you pay for,
what, how well did you socially

00:09:44.017 --> 00:09:47.687
engineer your supervisors and
bosses and financial team to get

00:09:47.687 --> 00:09:52.625
the funding that you need for
that role match the expectations

00:09:52.625 --> 00:09:57.497
and requirements to that. Right?
We've seen position restrictions

00:09:57.497 --> 00:10:03.503
all over the place. Jack of all
trades and master of none. What

00:10:05.672 --> 00:10:09.209
do you really, really want? I'm
not doing the dance, sorry,

00:10:09.209 --> 00:10:15.215
guys. It's too early and I have
not drank anything yet. I am not

00:10:19.018 --> 00:10:23.756
doing the dance. Okay. If you
want to log monkey and you need

00:10:23.756 --> 00:10:30.497
somebody to work on a sock, say
so. We've all seen those

00:10:30.497 --> 00:10:34.167
encrypted sort of job
descriptions that make no sense

00:10:34.167 --> 00:10:40.206
and have a list of buzz words
and lingo. >> And a lot of these

00:10:40.206 --> 00:10:45.612
-- that's okay. There is a lot
of broke-ass college students

00:10:45.612 --> 00:10:52.418
that will take anything. But if
you don't tell them that they're

00:10:52.418 --> 00:10:56.656
going to be a log monkey and
that it's going to be a learning

00:10:56.656 --> 00:11:00.293
-- something they can learn and
grow and do, they're not going

00:11:00.293 --> 00:11:03.129
to apply because they're going
to think they're overqualified.

00:11:03.129 --> 00:11:05.798
Something that a lot of us
suffer from is that imposter

00:11:05.798 --> 00:11:09.335
syndrome. We're not good enough.
And your job descriptions aren't

00:11:09.335 --> 00:11:11.337
helping. We don't know what
you're looking for is entry

00:11:11.337 --> 00:11:17.343
level and that you're going to
help us grow with your company.

00:11:21.147 --> 00:11:27.854
Right? So just say what you
want. >> So what really matters?

00:11:27.854 --> 00:11:33.860
Your environment, your team,
your business that you're

00:11:37.497 --> 00:11:44.671
supporting.What really matters,
to the environment, to the team,

00:11:44.671 --> 00:11:50.143
to the business that you're
supporting? With that

00:11:50.143 --> 00:11:56.950
experience, doesn't ask for
things just because. That's

00:11:56.950 --> 00:12:00.119
really going to [indiscernible]
we need folks to go I've never

00:12:00.119 --> 00:12:04.490
done this with X tool and
they're not going to apply. And

00:12:04.490 --> 00:12:06.926
that might be the perfect
candidate for you or they could

00:12:06.926 --> 00:12:10.063
be within 3 to 6 months because
you helped them nurture and

00:12:10.063 --> 00:12:16.069
grow. Yes, we've seen those job
descriptions. We've seen those

00:12:24.744 --> 00:12:27.447
job descriptions, oh, you have
to come from an ivy league

00:12:27.447 --> 00:12:33.252
school with a certification that
none of us can afford on our

00:12:33.252 --> 00:12:35.655
own. We all know how that
testing process is just so

00:12:35.655 --> 00:12:41.661
awesome. >> Another thing that
helps is letting people know if

00:12:48.201 --> 00:12:50.203
you don't have these
certifications that you're

00:12:50.203 --> 00:12:53.840
willing to get them within X
number of months. That is good

00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:56.743
to have on there, too. That
shows the job hunter that you

00:12:56.743 --> 00:13:02.682
actually care. >> -- from other
companies that were able to

00:13:09.222 --> 00:13:15.194
nurture and grow their team. We
need to help grow our own. We

00:13:15.194 --> 00:13:21.300
need help nurturing our own. So
scope, what is -- for? What are

00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:26.406
you trying to do? Get into the
specifics of it Mr. or Mrs.

00:13:26.406 --> 00:13:32.945
Hiring manager. Or is this all
the fittings. A Jack of all

00:13:32.945 --> 00:13:37.016
trades and master of none. That
sometimes needs to be the case

00:13:37.016 --> 00:13:39.018
if you're in a small
organization and you only have

00:13:39.018 --> 00:13:44.957
one or two people on your team.
Where do we fit? Where are you

00:13:44.957 --> 00:13:47.894
supposed to fit in that
organization? Does it make sense

00:13:47.894 --> 00:13:53.900
that we fit under IT or under
legal. And for a lot of start

00:14:22.395 --> 00:14:24.397
ups, we need a security person,
let's get a security architect

00:14:24.397 --> 00:14:26.532
and throw him under the manager
of IT. >> And that sounds good

00:14:26.532 --> 00:14:28.534
in theory but in practice you're
going to have issues because

00:14:28.534 --> 00:14:30.670
it's a conflict of interest. The
head of IT is concerned about up

00:14:30.670 --> 00:14:32.739
time and making sure the users
are happy, they have 50 zillion

00:14:32.739 --> 00:14:34.741
versions of Java. But security
doesn't want that: We're going

00:14:34.741 --> 00:14:36.743
to butt heads with management.
So it's important for us to

00:14:36.743 --> 00:14:38.745
consider where we're going to
put our people. >> From the

00:14:38.745 --> 00:14:40.747
other perspective, apply, the
job is yours. Throw the money in

00:14:40.747 --> 00:14:44.050
and send them to hacker summer
camp. There are conversations

00:14:44.050 --> 00:14:50.957
that I had with candidates that
expected double and triple the

00:14:50.957 --> 00:14:57.296
going rate for that role in that
area. Are you trying to troll me

00:14:57.296 --> 00:15:03.236
or are you looking for a new
role? Great question. The

00:15:05.471 --> 00:15:10.743
question is what is the rate?
And that's dependent upon where

00:15:10.743 --> 00:15:14.814
that organization is, physical
location and also what the job

00:15:14.814 --> 00:15:21.087
is and what it entails. And
experience. There's multiple

00:15:21.087 --> 00:15:27.093
qualifiers that fit into that.
Yes. Correct. So the question

00:15:52.151 --> 00:15:57.456
is, hey, we have some references
to figure out what that rate is?

00:15:57.456 --> 00:16:00.993
And why don't we circle up after
and I can give you a couple of

00:16:00.993 --> 00:16:03.796
those. There is a couple of
websites specifically for if I'm

00:16:03.796 --> 00:16:09.669
working in X location, what do I
need to move to Y location?

00:16:09.669 --> 00:16:13.439
What's the equivalent of that.
>> You can post that on Twitter

00:16:13.439 --> 00:16:17.910
as well. Because we know after
this talk, there is other talks

00:16:17.910 --> 00:16:22.381
and other things you want to
see. So we'll post our, I'll

00:16:22.381 --> 00:16:27.787
post my Twitter handle so you
can look and keep an eye out. >>

00:16:27.787 --> 00:16:32.592
There are a couple of different
salary surveys as well to figure

00:16:32.592 --> 00:16:35.995
out what is going on and figure
out what that is to the location

00:16:35.995 --> 00:16:38.598
that you're at. Yes, sir? >> Do
they want experience? >> The

00:16:38.598 --> 00:16:40.633
scenario, yes, I would like an
unpaid intern for my team, with

00:16:40.633 --> 00:16:42.635
experience. >> That's exactly
what we're about to talk about.

00:16:42.635 --> 00:16:44.770
>> Thank you for the segue. >>
He is absolutely right. A lot of

00:16:44.770 --> 00:16:46.772
hiring managers are stumped
because we don't know how to --

00:16:46.772 --> 00:16:48.774
properly convey to HR what we
really need. They just know what

00:16:48.774 --> 00:16:51.577
they think they want. So that's
when it becomes a social

00:16:51.577 --> 00:16:57.583
engineering exercise, right? >>
Application process. How do we

00:18:06.786 --> 00:18:11.424
get this put together? And this
needs to be done on both sides

00:18:11.424 --> 00:18:15.161
before we make the first calls.
Because you know what, you can

00:18:15.161 --> 00:18:18.030
finish the application process,
and hire and start somewhere

00:18:18.030 --> 00:18:20.032
else before you even reached out
and said [indiscernible] how

00:18:20.032 --> 00:18:27.340
would you like a phone call with
the HR recruiter. How do we find

00:18:27.340 --> 00:18:31.978
candidates. Us hiring managers
and meeting them face to face.

00:18:31.978 --> 00:18:38.884
Contributing back to the
community. Working online with

00:18:38.884 --> 00:18:43.522
stuff. >> And it's great that we
have a couple of hiring managers

00:18:43.522 --> 00:18:48.260
here and it's a great start. But
we need to get our companies

00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:51.931
more interested in DEFCON, et
cetera, because that is where

00:18:51.931 --> 00:18:55.201
they're going to find the
talent, right. That's where

00:18:55.201 --> 00:18:59.238
they're going to seek people
that know their stuff who are

00:18:59.238 --> 00:19:02.074
interested in hacking and
interested in learning things

00:19:02.074 --> 00:19:06.445
naturally and they can use that
and harness that. They look at

00:19:06.445 --> 00:19:10.483
our conferences and think we're
a bunch of drunk kids running

00:19:10.483 --> 00:19:14.086
around and turning pools purple.
>> I haven't done that in years.

00:19:14.086 --> 00:19:20.092
I don't know what you're talking
about. She is color blind. Leave

00:19:22.328 --> 00:19:28.334
her alone. The other thing to
think about is your role, hiring

00:19:30.770 --> 00:19:37.309
manager, in talent. More than a
lack of upper management or the

00:19:37.309 --> 00:19:42.148
things that we're talking about,
the gap of middle management.

00:19:42.148 --> 00:19:46.619
We're the ones that do the
staffing, and spend the budget

00:19:46.619 --> 00:19:54.093
and want the best optimal usage
for the budget. When there is a

00:19:54.093 --> 00:19:56.562
failure at the [indiscernible]
level the whole thing falls

00:19:56.562 --> 00:20:02.568
apart. Let's talk about HR and
recruiters. You have those paid

00:20:10.443 --> 00:20:13.612
recruiters, the overseas body
shops you can tell by the first

00:20:13.612 --> 00:20:19.618
word. Need I say more? I will
say that the CEO of E24 has an

00:20:26.492 --> 00:20:31.063
interesting blog post called
dear head hunters, fuck you.

00:20:33.866 --> 00:20:36.669
It's actually quite an
interesting read. I would highly

00:20:36.669 --> 00:20:43.776
recommend it. So types of
questions. When you're figuring

00:20:43.776 --> 00:20:46.345
out what that position
description is, they matches up

00:20:46.345 --> 00:20:50.850
to the types of scenarios during
the telephone and interview

00:20:50.850 --> 00:20:56.655
process. >> It helps when
writing the questions to look at

00:20:56.655 --> 00:21:03.229
the job description that you put
out there and you can use that

00:21:03.229 --> 00:21:07.566
to tailor the questions, right.
We want this.How do I find out

00:21:07.566 --> 00:21:12.705
if this person has this or if
they're trying to pass through

00:21:12.705 --> 00:21:14.707
[indiscernible]. >> In defining
the key areas, we saw some

00:21:14.707 --> 00:21:19.612
interesting things. Hiring a
recent college grad with five

00:21:19.612 --> 00:21:25.618
years experience and Olympic
medals and superpowers. And

00:21:29.722 --> 00:21:34.393
compensation. You have an idea
as a hiring manager for your

00:21:34.393 --> 00:21:40.499
particular area what -- you have
an idea. Pay them what you're

00:21:40.499 --> 00:21:43.502
worth and what you're capable
of. If you can't, how do we work

00:21:43.502 --> 00:21:49.341
other ways? Vacation, flexible
work schedule. Maybe work out a

00:21:49.341 --> 00:21:53.546
training budget and throw that
in if you can't pay them in

00:21:53.546 --> 00:21:55.781
compensation. There are ways of
working around that from a

00:21:55.781 --> 00:21:59.718
hiring manager perspective and
for someone trying to get hired.

00:21:59.718 --> 00:22:04.423
It's not just about the
Benjamins. At least I hope not.

00:22:09.361 --> 00:22:11.597
We want professional
development. Thank you. Just the

00:22:11.597 --> 00:22:17.603
stock options and free lunch
isn't going to cut it. The beer

00:22:24.009 --> 00:22:26.312
cart and the ping-pong table
isn't going to cut it either.

00:22:28.814 --> 00:22:33.853
And UX (ph.) love it. >> This is
mildly depending on who is

00:22:33.853 --> 00:22:37.790
looking for a job and you
recognize that. Especially

00:22:37.790 --> 00:22:42.561
people entering the work force,
they have a completely different

00:22:42.561 --> 00:22:46.765
set of expectations than the
majority that have been in the

00:22:46.765 --> 00:22:51.604
industry for a while. They might
be happy with the T-shirt and

00:22:51.604 --> 00:22:56.075
cool free lunches and beer cart
on Friday. Sometimes you offer

00:22:56.075 --> 00:22:59.712
different things to different
people that you're looking to

00:22:59.712 --> 00:23:03.582
hire. And that's okay. >> Let's
talk about the application

00:23:03.582 --> 00:23:09.989
tracking systems that we all
love. From a hiring manager, we

00:23:09.989 --> 00:23:13.892
have to remember, that's the
first or second step after

00:23:13.892 --> 00:23:16.528
looking at that position
description you have posted and

00:23:16.528 --> 00:23:19.865
giving that first impression to
the candidates. Why are you

00:23:19.865 --> 00:23:22.034
asking for PII in the
application process? Why and do

00:23:22.034 --> 00:23:24.670
a check? Perfect example. Why
are you asking me for a social

00:23:24.670 --> 00:23:26.672
security number, driver's
license, and state for a senior

00:23:26.672 --> 00:23:29.275
manager of information security
... >> That should disqualify

00:23:29.275 --> 00:23:32.211
them. If they answer those
questions it should be like,

00:23:32.211 --> 00:23:35.714
nope. >> Another great example
of the sexy is there are some

00:23:35.714 --> 00:23:38.550
birth and driver's license
numbers this is a CPA auditor

00:23:38.550 --> 00:23:41.553
company, the HR gal that replied
back to me saying I didn't get

00:23:41.553 --> 00:23:44.356
an interview never responded to
my emails about can I talk to

00:23:44.356 --> 00:23:46.925
you about the privacy violation
you have on the website

00:23:46.925 --> 00:23:48.928
[indiscernible]. Notice the nice
little certificate there, too.

00:23:48.928 --> 00:23:50.929
>> After they're selected,
right. That's a great question.

00:23:50.929 --> 00:23:53.666
Some of -- the fact that you
have to do a background check

00:23:53.666 --> 00:23:56.802
before you bring somebody on.
How do you do that? You need to

00:23:56.802 --> 00:24:02.241
ask for the PII. >> In the
consideration of time ... Okay.

00:24:02.241 --> 00:24:08.247
Background check. That is not
whether someone is qualified or

00:24:19.191 --> 00:24:25.197
not. It's saying what kind of
background do they have with

00:24:32.638 --> 00:24:38.644
credit and law enforcement
issues. As hackers, some of us

00:24:51.757 --> 00:24:57.763
make bad decisions. Others are
just caught. So background

00:25:07.873 --> 00:25:11.543
checks. Yes, that's done after
the interview process because is

00:25:11.543 --> 00:25:15.247
that costs them money. And that
is directly against a line item

00:25:15.247 --> 00:25:21.253
in my budget. So if I'm serious
about someone I'm going to have

00:25:43.142 --> 00:25:49.148
a conversation with them
beforehand, this is the HR

00:25:51.250 --> 00:25:54.887
policy for the organization. I
need to do this. Is there

00:25:54.887 --> 00:25:58.991
anything we need to talk about
beforehand. There is a form and

00:25:58.991 --> 00:26:02.661
a proper way of submitting that
form with the PII on it so it's

00:26:02.661 --> 00:26:08.667
safeguarded and done
appropriately. >> A lot of times

00:26:30.222 --> 00:26:33.959
this information isn't used. You
can be my segue person, sir, for

00:26:33.959 --> 00:26:39.965
the rest of this talk. I can't
put special characters and

00:26:43.902 --> 00:26:50.342
passwords, really? This one was
weird. Here click on this link

00:26:50.342 --> 00:26:54.546
and I get this pop up, going
you're logging in as user name

00:26:54.546 --> 00:27:02.354
HR but the website does not
require authentication. Hum ...

00:27:02.354 --> 00:27:08.360
Hum ... Fail. This gentleman
here is filling out the job

00:27:12.297 --> 00:27:17.135
application and was frustrated
enough with this question, which

00:27:17.135 --> 00:27:20.339
do you most identify with and
why. >> [indiscernible] by the

00:27:20.339 --> 00:27:26.345
way. >> So this -- you do not
put any context into what sort

00:27:29.448 --> 00:27:35.187
of job he is applying to. If
this is an online media company,

00:27:37.289 --> 00:27:42.027
it might be relevant. Certainly
for InfoSec it would not be in

00:27:42.027 --> 00:27:48.600
my opinion. This might also --
depending on the question --

00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:53.872
reflect on ageism, too. >> So we
went back and forth on this one.

00:27:53.872 --> 00:27:58.277
I'm cool with this question. I
would have to be really, really

00:27:58.277 --> 00:28:01.880
picky and since I'm a person
that overanalyzes things, it

00:28:01.880 --> 00:28:07.019
would take five hours. A lot of
the -- folks say they know what

00:28:07.019 --> 00:28:11.790
amine nah is to begin with,
maybe this is a culture I want

00:28:11.790 --> 00:28:16.562
to be a part of. It's a question
of are they being professional.

00:28:16.562 --> 00:28:22.401
Do I want to be a part of this
organization. >> That is part of

00:28:22.401 --> 00:28:24.970
selecting the right questions
and at the right time. Should

00:28:24.970 --> 00:28:27.205
this be an essay question where
I'm not sure if you're looking

00:28:27.205 --> 00:28:29.908
for a humorist or serious
answer. Or maybe more

00:28:29.908 --> 00:28:37.482
appropriate for a human
interview where you can have a

00:28:37.482 --> 00:28:44.690
conversation about it and why.
Hackers, hacking the resume. No

00:28:44.690 --> 00:28:48.727
BS guys, and gals. We can figure
it out really easily. It's

00:28:48.727 --> 00:28:54.733
knowing what the terms mean,
what you want to do or try to do

00:28:58.604 --> 00:29:06.111
in this role. We're going to
clear the bullshit. >> Even if

00:29:06.111 --> 00:29:13.719
you have limited experience with
a tool, or a network topology or

00:29:13.719 --> 00:29:19.524
managing thing, put it on the
resume but let us know how

00:29:19.524 --> 00:29:24.096
limited or experienced you are
with that tool. If you've been

00:29:24.096 --> 00:29:28.433
into it and you can navigate
around and you've done a light

00:29:28.433 --> 00:29:32.971
penetration test as part of your
course work, I want to know

00:29:32.971 --> 00:29:36.408
about that. Because that's
relevant to my interests, so

00:29:36.408 --> 00:29:41.713
that way I can help you work on
your path to become a pentester

00:29:41.713 --> 00:29:47.252
if that's what you want to do
and that's what I'm hiring for.

00:29:47.252 --> 00:29:54.660
>> Yes, I have a file of the
worst resumes ever. Yes, I will

00:29:54.660 --> 00:30:00.999
-- I do redact them, but those I
use as examples when I mentor

00:30:00.999 --> 00:30:06.038
interns and young staff on
whatnot to do. Don't give me any

00:30:06.038 --> 00:30:12.544
more. I have enough examples.
It's tailoring that resume to

00:30:12.544 --> 00:30:15.781
make it relevant to the employer
and the hiring manager. It needs

00:30:15.781 --> 00:30:22.020
to be long enough to reach where
it's supposed to go. It's only

00:30:22.020 --> 00:30:26.258
supposed to be one page, only
supposed to be two page. Does it

00:30:26.258 --> 00:30:31.830
reflect what you can and want to
do so it reaches where you want

00:30:31.830 --> 00:30:38.704
to go? Honestly for myself, I
have a two-page resume and a

00:30:38.704 --> 00:30:43.942
full CV that is five pages and I
submit both. >> When you're

00:30:43.942 --> 00:30:49.481
building out your resume pay
close attention to what you name

00:30:49.481 --> 00:30:57.055
it. If you call it resume dot
XX. I'm going to put it in order

00:30:57.055 --> 00:31:03.028
because I have 50 of them. It's
hard to distinguish them. Put

00:31:03.028 --> 00:31:08.567
first name, last name, CV doc or
something like that. Sanitize

00:31:08.567 --> 00:31:13.805
the meta data. Please. >> That's
the next line. So one or two

00:31:13.805 --> 00:31:19.377
page or full CV. I send both
because humans want different

00:31:19.377 --> 00:31:25.283
things and hiring managers want
different things. Different HR

00:31:25.283 --> 00:31:28.220
folks want different things.
I've run into companies where if

00:31:28.220 --> 00:31:31.056
the resume was not formatted to
their company standard, you

00:31:31.056 --> 00:31:34.893
didn't get a phone call. >> They
didn't share what that file

00:31:34.893 --> 00:31:41.466
format was. >> No, they didn't.
You had to know. File names make

00:31:41.466 --> 00:31:44.936
a difference. And sanitizing the
meta data. Managers make

00:31:44.936 --> 00:31:50.041
mistakes. HR makes mistakes and
we lose documents and good

00:31:50.041 --> 00:31:55.981
labeling helps you out.
Determining if you're qualified

00:31:55.981 --> 00:32:02.220
or not is not your job yet when
you're applying for a gig. It's

00:32:02.220 --> 00:32:06.291
the job of HR and perhaps the
tracking system and who is

00:32:06.291 --> 00:32:09.661
hiring will make that
determination. Keep that in

00:32:09.661 --> 00:32:12.898
mind. >> It's okay to apply for
things that you may not be

00:32:12.898 --> 00:32:15.433
qualified for yet burr are
interested in as long as you

00:32:15.433 --> 00:32:18.470
have the ability and are willing
and able to work. >> You have

00:32:18.470 --> 00:32:21.273
tracking systems. The CMS, the
heavy ones that we love to hate

00:32:21.273 --> 00:32:23.341
and the lightweight ones.
Submission, keeping track of who

00:32:23.341 --> 00:32:25.777
submitted and whatnot. With
those, the heavyweight ones,

00:32:25.777 --> 00:32:31.783
it's recommended to be one of
the first to apply and trying to

00:32:49.234 --> 00:32:52.437
fill out every application box
or text box in that

00:32:52.437 --> 00:32:56.775
application.If you don't feel
comfortable filling it out, put

00:32:56.775 --> 00:33:03.148
a dot. Put a period or something
else in there. On those resumes,

00:33:03.148 --> 00:33:07.619
web safe fonts. Spell check and
spell check again and have a

00:33:07.619 --> 00:33:12.991
friend who is an English major
read it over for you. Don't use

00:33:12.991 --> 00:33:17.362
graphics or special characters.
The system can't handle it. And

00:33:17.362 --> 00:33:22.634
the HR person is not going to
call you and say your resume got

00:33:22.634 --> 00:33:26.104
messed up and you need to
resubmit. >> Applications. You

00:33:26.104 --> 00:33:31.309
may be a unique little
[indiscernible] but that should

00:33:31.309 --> 00:33:37.315
not be reflected in your font. I
don't want to see text like a 12

00:33:39.985 --> 00:33:46.925
year-old girl with a glitter pen
wrote your email. Use Times New

00:33:46.925 --> 00:33:53.865
Roman or 12 point font or
whatever and make it easy to

00:33:53.865 --> 00:33:59.070
read. If you're scrolling --
[indiscernible] that is okay

00:33:59.070 --> 00:34:05.377
too. >> That email application
is the opportunity for the cover

00:34:05.377 --> 00:34:09.781
letter and why you want the job
and why you match that job and

00:34:09.781 --> 00:34:14.920
things that you can't easily
convey within the resume. Email,

00:34:14.920 --> 00:34:20.725
digital signature, bonus. Hey,
you understand how that works.

00:34:20.725 --> 00:34:27.732
>> I was going to say check your
copy/paste. I'll write an intro

00:34:27.732 --> 00:34:35.307
to an email and copy and paste
it and sometimes I forget to

00:34:35.307 --> 00:34:41.713
change the company name. It's
awkward and you're not going to

00:34:41.713 --> 00:34:48.587
get a call back. >> Real quick
for the military and government

00:34:48.587 --> 00:34:51.489
jobs, they have their own
special snow flake website which

00:34:51.489 --> 00:34:55.594
is the worst unwielding from
death you ever experienced. >>

00:34:55.594 --> 00:35:02.300
Also it was breeched. >> And it
was breeched like they all are.

00:35:02.300 --> 00:35:06.071
Be sure to answer the qualifier
questions as best you can. The

00:35:06.071 --> 00:35:09.007
hint is to look at the
description of all those

00:35:09.007 --> 00:35:12.377
questions, write it up first,
and then go in the submission

00:35:12.377 --> 00:35:16.348
process. If you're trying to
word Smith while the application

00:35:16.348 --> 00:35:22.153
is up, you're going to set
yourself up for failure. We

00:35:22.153 --> 00:35:27.392
talked about this. Customize our
resume. One or two pages for

00:35:27.392 --> 00:35:31.396
human digestion, awesome. The
full CD, the ATS system, because

00:35:31.396 --> 00:35:37.402
they're doing that, they aren't
matching. You need indicators.

00:35:47.045 --> 00:35:53.051
>> That's just awesome. >> Go to
the next slide and you're going

00:36:10.602 --> 00:36:14.005
to be the second person for
second ways in our talk. >> It's

00:36:14.005 --> 00:36:17.976
helpful to have a couple
different versions of your

00:36:17.976 --> 00:36:23.782
resume. You hear that all the
time. I have two main ones. One

00:36:23.782 --> 00:36:29.054
with my hacker stuff on it. And
one without it. And so there is

00:36:29.054 --> 00:36:33.324
one resume with the Tottenkoph
because companies want to see

00:36:33.324 --> 00:36:38.029
that and it shows that you're
active in the community and

00:36:38.029 --> 00:36:42.300
learning and doing stuff. Other
people might get a little

00:36:42.300 --> 00:36:47.872
scared. So you might want to
turn it down or make sure you

00:36:47.872 --> 00:36:52.977
only have like the professional
-- it's hit or miss. You might

00:36:52.977 --> 00:36:58.116
not want to work for folks that
turn away you speaking at

00:36:58.116 --> 00:37:02.754
DEFCON, right. Because that
means they may not pay for you

00:37:02.754 --> 00:37:07.292
to come. >> So yes, there are
little tricks for when you do

00:37:07.292 --> 00:37:10.728
applications on USA jobs, that
is just one of them. This is

00:37:10.728 --> 00:37:13.865
probably not the forum to
further discuss that. I'm going

00:37:13.865 --> 00:37:19.504
to say, don't hack with your
resume. >> It's not cute. >> I

00:37:19.504 --> 00:37:26.277
have gotten people that applied
for jobs with exploits in the

00:37:26.277 --> 00:37:32.684
media. Seriously? Yes, I check
for those things. Come on. Nor,

00:37:32.684 --> 00:37:36.621
let me put that caveat in there,
is the application process an

00:37:36.621 --> 00:37:41.159
opportunity to do a penetration
test on the application system.

00:37:41.159 --> 00:37:47.365
That is after you get hired.
[indiscernible]. So you're

00:37:47.365 --> 00:37:50.969
talking about government stuff,
security clearances. Does not

00:37:50.969 --> 00:37:55.073
belong in a resume. Does not
belong on linked in. You're

00:37:55.073 --> 00:37:59.177
making yourself a target. Read
the documentation. You read it.

00:37:59.177 --> 00:38:05.550
It doesn't matter, yes, it all
got stolen. >> There is also

00:38:05.550 --> 00:38:12.724
some disagreement as well. We
heard people say, I always put

00:38:12.724 --> 00:38:19.264
it on there and they won't
consider the application unless

00:38:19.264 --> 00:38:26.471
it's on there. There are ways to
get around it. Security

00:38:26.471 --> 00:38:30.842
clearance information upon
request. [indiscernible] >> And

00:38:30.842 --> 00:38:35.446
yes, I've known folks that have
lost opportunities over that.

00:38:35.446 --> 00:38:38.983
And all I can say is that
organization can't handle doing

00:38:38.983 --> 00:38:42.821
this in the right process and
right way, do you want to work

00:38:42.821 --> 00:38:48.526
for them? This is a time to
communicate, folks.

00:38:51.863 --> 00:38:55.233
Professionally looking email,
cover letter, professionally

00:38:55.233 --> 00:38:58.303
looking email address, digital
certificate. The whole nine

00:38:58.303 --> 00:39:04.242
yards. We expect that within
your work as well. And yes, I'm

00:39:07.078 --> 00:39:10.281
going to Google that email
address and I'm going to Google

00:39:10.281 --> 00:39:15.353
that user name. >> We need to go
through this quicker because

00:39:15.353 --> 00:39:21.192
we're short on time. So, yes,
couple important -- it's a pain

00:39:21.192 --> 00:39:27.498
in the butt to write. Make sure
you are friends with an English

00:39:27.498 --> 00:39:33.805
major. They can read it over and
make sure it doesn't suck or

00:39:33.805 --> 00:39:38.676
sucks less. Use your network.
You're at DEFCON, right. Which

00:39:38.676 --> 00:39:44.515
by the way, whoo!. We're at
DEFCON. There are tons of events

00:39:44.515 --> 00:39:50.355
and contests and things you can
do and meet new people. Villages

00:39:50.355 --> 00:39:55.193
and workshops. If you're not
doing these things and meeting

00:39:55.193 --> 00:40:00.565
new people you're doing yourself
a huge disservice. It's a great

00:40:00.565 --> 00:40:06.371
way to meet hiring managers. If
you didn't make note of people

00:40:06.371 --> 00:40:12.210
who are hiring, you kind of
failed. Can the people that are

00:40:12.210 --> 00:40:17.081
hiring raise your hands again,
please? Thank you. Right. So

00:40:17.081 --> 00:40:22.420
working with recruiters. We have
a couple of different types of

00:40:22.420 --> 00:40:28.259
recruiters out there. A lot of
the times you're not a specific

00:40:28.259 --> 00:40:34.098
snow flake to the recruiter.
They did a search of who has

00:40:34.098 --> 00:40:39.937
something they need and they'll
send you an email. It's not a

00:40:39.937 --> 00:40:45.276
guaranteed job. >> Treat every
interview with a recruiter as an

00:40:45.276 --> 00:40:50.915
interview. It's best behavior.
It's trying to figure out which

00:40:50.915 --> 00:40:58.323
recruiter that you're working
with that is one of those body

00:40:58.323 --> 00:41:04.062
shops over seas or a legit
recruiter working with that

00:41:04.062 --> 00:41:08.967
company to match up the skills
to an environment. >> We know

00:41:08.967 --> 00:41:14.539
there is a bunch of us looking
for work. What we don't realize

00:41:14.539 --> 00:41:20.111
is they're looking for us. We
are in high demand and we're in

00:41:20.111 --> 00:41:24.382
a constantly growing industry.
People with our skill set are

00:41:24.382 --> 00:41:28.653
really [indiscernible]. Just
because you know how to fire a

00:41:28.653 --> 00:41:33.791
wire short doesn't (ph.) mean
you're going to get a job. Just

00:41:33.791 --> 00:41:38.496
keep it real. Interview. A lot
of us have problems with

00:41:38.496 --> 00:41:41.499
interviews on both sides.
Interviewer, interviewee. From

00:41:41.499 --> 00:41:44.936
the interviewee side it's
difficult. We're trying to

00:41:44.936 --> 00:41:50.508
figure out the questions and who
is bull shitting us and not, who

00:41:50.508 --> 00:41:55.646
is interested in learning and
who is just wasting our time. >>

00:41:55.646 --> 00:42:00.718
The monkey questions get us
nowhere and we've all had them.

00:42:00.718 --> 00:42:05.022
>> What do we mean by stump the
monkey? It's to find out how

00:42:05.022 --> 00:42:11.229
smart or dumb someone is by
playing a jeopardy-like game.

00:42:11.229 --> 00:42:18.136
It's rapid fire questions. It's
important to know if someone is

00:42:18.136 --> 00:42:24.142
bull shitting or not. But you're
not there to sit there and, you

00:42:26.310 --> 00:42:31.949
know, have them regurgitate
their last couple years of

00:42:31.949 --> 00:42:38.256
college. >> Talking about
question BIOS. Not being a dick.

00:42:38.256 --> 00:42:43.961
Today is not be a dick day. So
what if the candidate doesn't

00:42:43.961 --> 00:42:51.602
know how to work with maple or
oak or pine or Palo Alto or

00:42:51.602 --> 00:42:58.743
Cisco. Can they learn to use
that tool to find the threats in

00:42:58.743 --> 00:43:06.050
your environment or phone that
box or write that policy? I

00:43:06.050 --> 00:43:11.722
don't care what port or excuse
me what protocol uses port 0. I

00:43:11.722 --> 00:43:17.061
can look that up. We should not
reinforce the rote memorization

00:43:17.061 --> 00:43:20.898
of questions that the school
system ingrained in us. It's

00:43:20.898 --> 00:43:24.101
thinking outside the box and
figure out what is going on and

00:43:24.101 --> 00:43:30.107
stop the madness. >> So
reviewing resumes, keep in mind

00:43:37.281 --> 00:43:41.285
the area that you're hiring in.
Seattle, San Francisco, places

00:43:41.285 --> 00:43:44.889
like that have a lot of
contractors. Contractors who

00:43:44.889 --> 00:43:50.094
can't control when the contract
ends and they have to get a job

00:43:50.094 --> 00:43:54.499
as quickly as possible because
they need that money. Keep that

00:43:54.499 --> 00:43:58.102
in mind and don't automatically
discriminate someone because it

00:43:58.102 --> 00:44:03.241
looks like they're job hopping.
If you talk to them and find out

00:44:03.241 --> 00:44:07.211
the background, it could be
something simple like a contract

00:44:07.211 --> 00:44:12.383
or a death or things outside of
their control. >> Family illness

00:44:12.383 --> 00:44:16.420
I've come across. They went to
school -- hey, the recession is

00:44:16.420 --> 00:44:19.991
still out there in some
environments. It's hard to find

00:44:19.991 --> 00:44:25.997
a good job. Okay? We hear that
excuse that it's not a cultural

00:44:28.432 --> 00:44:32.069
thing. They're not technical
enough. We need to stop using

00:44:32.069 --> 00:44:36.440
this as a crutch for not hiring
someone. We hire for aptitude.

00:44:36.440 --> 00:44:40.111
Hire for whether they can or
learn to do something and

00:44:40.111 --> 00:44:46.150
protect our environment. Can
they do the job? Can they learn?

00:44:46.150 --> 00:44:49.220
Are we looking for a purple
squirrel? That is what the

00:44:49.220 --> 00:44:52.490
recruiters call it when you have
something you cannot find. Or

00:44:52.490 --> 00:44:57.628
worse are they looking for the
plaid unicorn. I had to go to

00:44:57.628 --> 00:45:01.899
ETSY to find a plaid unicorn
because I couldn't find any art

00:45:01.899 --> 00:45:06.971
work because nobody is drawing
it yet. How hard is it to find

00:45:06.971 --> 00:45:10.474
that perfect candidate? >> We
want to know they're willing and

00:45:10.474 --> 00:45:16.747
able to learn. They're
interested in their job. They're

00:45:16.747 --> 00:45:21.852
interested enough to protect our
environment and our users. We

00:45:21.852 --> 00:45:28.726
want passion. We're not saying
you shouldn't use the passion as

00:45:28.726 --> 00:45:32.930
an excuse to have them work
overtime and burn them out

00:45:32.930 --> 00:45:36.767
because you'll have to recycle
through new InfoSec people. We

00:45:36.767 --> 00:45:41.372
also want the ability to fail
and admit they failed or were

00:45:41.372 --> 00:45:45.910
wrong. That is how we learn. >>
Hackers, find the company you're

00:45:45.910 --> 00:45:49.013
trying to interview with. Figure
out what is going on. Use glass

00:45:49.013 --> 00:45:51.282
door and figure out what is
going on. Knowing your target

00:45:51.282 --> 00:45:55.820
and knowing who you're trying to
social engineer to get into that

00:45:55.820 --> 00:45:59.490
job. Have your three bullets and
stick to them. Question

00:45:59.490 --> 00:46:05.429
everything. Right. Please wear
pants. Or at least a kilt.

00:46:09.567 --> 00:46:13.571
Question everything and question
timing. Did the interviewees

00:46:13.571 --> 00:46:16.607
give you an opportunity to
interview them or give you the

00:46:16.607 --> 00:46:21.245
token 3 to 5 minutes at the end?
That tells me something about

00:46:21.245 --> 00:46:27.251
that team. At the end. I've
gotten these emails, too. >>

00:46:31.822 --> 00:46:37.828
Very nice and polite, fuck you.
Oh, thank you. No. >> Hiring

00:46:41.265 --> 00:46:44.602
managers we need to stop leaving
people hanging. Let them know as

00:46:44.602 --> 00:46:47.938
soon as you figure it out that
you're going to someone else. We

00:46:47.938 --> 00:46:53.277
need to find a way even if it's
months or years down the road to

00:46:53.277 --> 00:46:56.614
provide feed back to those folks
about why you couldn't hire

00:46:56.614 --> 00:47:02.486
them. >> And a note about not
following up with folks. It's a

00:47:02.486 --> 00:47:06.590
really small community. There
are 20 --> 000 people here at

00:47:06.590 --> 00:47:11.629
DEFCON, but we talk. A lot,
loudly, drunkenly and we will

00:47:11.629 --> 00:47:18.035
call out each and every one of
you that wronged us in some way,

00:47:18.035 --> 00:47:22.606
especially if we're really,
really trashed. So if you're a

00:47:22.606 --> 00:47:29.346
dick, or don't follow up at all
-- like I had a friend that

00:47:29.346 --> 00:47:33.050
didn't get a follow up from a
potential hire and I'm just

00:47:33.050 --> 00:47:37.621
like, or not a potential hire, a
potential job, and I'm just

00:47:37.621 --> 00:47:41.425
like, I was really, really
disappointed and it made me

00:47:41.425 --> 00:47:46.030
question the people who were
doing the hiring. And a lot of

00:47:46.030 --> 00:47:51.368
those people I knew, I was close
to. So just keep that in mind.

00:47:51.368 --> 00:47:57.341
Your actions do matter. >>
Hackers, follow up as well. Send

00:47:57.341 --> 00:48:00.211
a thank you email to everyone
you talked to and interviewed

00:48:00.211 --> 00:48:04.915
with. Even the receptionist.
They help you get that

00:48:04.915 --> 00:48:08.786
opportunity to have that
conversation. >> I got my first

00:48:08.786 --> 00:48:14.024
InfoSec job. I was ten minutes
late because of a downpour and

00:48:14.024 --> 00:48:18.362
traffic in Seattle, they didn't
disqualify me or penalize me

00:48:18.362 --> 00:48:23.601
because the PA to the hiring
manager thought I was adore able

00:48:23.601 --> 00:48:28.406
and so polite. And they pay
attention to those things. Keep

00:48:28.406 --> 00:48:33.544
that in mind. >> Show some
class. Even send a snail mail

00:48:33.544 --> 00:48:39.550
thank you card. Yes, they do
exist. But best not to send your

00:48:43.187 --> 00:48:47.491
social requests on social media
just yet. That is a little

00:48:47.491 --> 00:48:53.697
creepy. >> Just a little about
social networks. They do Google

00:48:53.697 --> 00:48:59.703
you. I know it seems obvious but
they do. If you sit there and

00:49:01.872 --> 00:49:08.345
bad mouth them and you're
looking to get a job there,

00:49:08.345 --> 00:49:16.020
chances are you're not going to
get to the next level. >> Yes.

00:49:16.020 --> 00:49:22.026
You have to remember there are
some folks that only have people

00:49:22.026 --> 00:49:25.563
they know and trust. Know and
trust. Where other folks, it's

00:49:25.563 --> 00:49:31.669
everybody in the world. >> As a
final note, a lot of us forget

00:49:31.669 --> 00:49:36.473
that we leave impressions on
people no matter what side of

00:49:36.473 --> 00:49:41.712
the table we're on. It's good to
be hypersensitive on how you

00:49:41.712 --> 00:49:46.517
portray yourself and talk to
other people. You never know if

00:49:46.517 --> 00:49:53.057
you're going to try to get a job
with this person down the line.

00:49:53.057 --> 00:49:56.060
>> So we went through this
rather quickly because this is a

00:49:56.060 --> 00:49:59.463
lot. There is a little annoying
things. It's those little things

00:49:59.463 --> 00:50:02.867
that get the network compromised
and it's the little things that

00:50:02.867 --> 00:50:06.871
ding us when we don't get the
job or the opportunity or get

00:50:06.871 --> 00:50:12.843
that person hired. >> It's not
one side -- the hiring managers

00:50:12.843 --> 00:50:18.215
or the job seekers fail, it's
both of our responsibilities to

00:50:18.215 --> 00:50:24.555
try to take our lessons learned
from the past and try to do

00:50:24.555 --> 00:50:30.928
better. We'd like to give thanks
to these folks. We stole a lot

00:50:30.928 --> 00:50:36.800
of quotes and pictures from
them. And any last minute -- we

00:50:36.800 --> 00:50:40.704
have like five minutes. Any
questions? >> Comments,

00:50:40.704 --> 00:50:45.676
concerns. No bull shit lies at
all? >> Exactly. Job seekers,

00:50:45.676 --> 00:50:51.682
what he said is please use open
source software, free ware to

00:50:54.451 --> 00:51:00.391
try to get that experience. A
lot of times we see those in

00:51:03.894 --> 00:51:10.467
corporate environments because
our budget is like that big.

00:51:10.467 --> 00:51:16.473
Yes? Just don't go all office
space on your current employer

00:51:18.509 --> 00:51:28.018
when you're going to the next
big thing. You don't know if the

00:51:28.018 --> 00:51:37.528
job is going to fall through or
later on down the line the

00:51:37.528 --> 00:51:44.101
previous employee, manager,
whatever is at the company that

00:51:44.101 --> 00:51:50.774
you want to work for. >> Again
we talked about it's a question

00:51:50.774 --> 00:52:15.833
of timing. >> Definitely. He was
saying -- there is a way to get

00:52:15.833 --> 00:52:17.835
your experience, to meet people.
All right. Thank you everybody.

00:52:17.835 --> 00:52:19.837
>> Thank you, folks.
