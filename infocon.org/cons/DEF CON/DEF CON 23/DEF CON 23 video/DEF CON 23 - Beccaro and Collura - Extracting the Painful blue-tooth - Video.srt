00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.006
Hello everyone and thank you for
coming. What we're about to

00:00:10.644 --> 00:00:16.650
speak next is blue tooth
security and focusing on Android

00:00:19.152 --> 00:00:25.158
smart phone. Interesting
stuffer. So the talk will be

00:00:29.496 --> 00:00:35.502
divided into 2 parts. And how
does it work. The second part we

00:00:40.274 --> 00:00:43.543
focus on the new stuff, all
right. So action. I'm Matteo --

00:00:43.543 --> 00:00:46.813
I'm a student and my friend the
other Matteo. >> Hello I'm

00:00:46.813 --> 00:00:49.950
Matteo Collura from same -- you
can make some confusion maybe

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:55.889
sometimes. I am a students at --
and researching different fields

00:01:00.694 --> 00:01:04.331
such as blue tooth and -- and
okay. You'll find some info

00:01:04.331 --> 00:01:10.971
about my contact. >> Okay, so
let's start this talk. From the

00:01:10.971 --> 00:01:16.977
name of the tooth because is
nice to spark this humor. The

00:01:20.814 --> 00:01:26.820
name blue tooth comes from --
12th century and his name was

00:01:30.657 --> 00:01:36.663
Hara and name blue tooth. And as
you can see that -- H and B.

00:01:44.404 --> 00:01:49.743
They match together and this is
the name of blue tooth the logo

00:01:49.743 --> 00:01:53.580
of blue tooth. Telling about
that and it is a cable

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:59.519
replacement proto call and it
works the same for -- as Wi-Fi

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:29.276
more or less, you try high
frequency -- 79 channels

00:06:12.339 --> 00:06:18.345
usually. Helps transmission.
This is info regarding the

00:08:27.607 --> 00:08:33.613
architecture. Actually is not so
useful from the point of view of

00:11:50.577 --> 00:11:56.516
the user. Maybe from the
designer because we can see a

00:14:56.529 --> 00:15:02.535
lot of proto calls we may use in
order to build our stock and our

00:19:10.149 --> 00:19:16.155
architecture and first you start
from the physical layer which

00:21:59.285 --> 00:22:05.291
you select your proper radio and
then at the top your base band

00:25:39.138 --> 00:25:45.144
and here come some very let say
important and -- proto call. And

00:29:18.890 --> 00:29:24.896
is comes along with this the
logical link controlling and the

00:32:24.976 --> 00:32:30.982
other proto call and link the
devices together and then the

00:35:00.465 --> 00:35:06.471
service discover proto call is
another monitoring one. But is

00:35:55.587 --> 00:36:01.593
not from the use of point of it.
So -- there has been so many

00:42:11.162 --> 00:42:13.164
updates on regard from blue
tooth. And first of all they

00:42:13.164 --> 00:42:15.166
started the introduce the
physical address from the blue

00:42:15.166 --> 00:42:17.168
tooth because obviously you
cannot target this decide about

00:42:17.168 --> 00:42:19.170
without knowing is address so
then it became up a -- hopping

00:42:19.170 --> 00:42:21.172
spectrum. That was in order to
make it resist tent and is

00:42:21.172 --> 00:42:23.174
dropping after that they know
how it was made and it was not

00:42:23.174 --> 00:42:25.176
so simple but it was easy to
east drop in communication. And

00:42:25.176 --> 00:42:27.178
after that -- professor so two
devices actually were it was

00:42:27.178 --> 00:42:29.180
easily to transfer the amount of
data to the devices -- and face

00:42:29.180 --> 00:42:31.182
shift king where introduce. So
this is just for telecom people

00:42:31.182 --> 00:42:33.184
and then from version 2.1. A
very -- update regarding your

00:42:33.184 --> 00:42:35.186
single pairing because before
this update the pairing

00:42:35.186 --> 00:42:37.188
mechanism was not so was secure
let say. We will see later. And

00:42:37.188 --> 00:42:39.190
from version 3 some updates
regarding data transfer because

00:42:39.190 --> 00:42:41.192
when you have very high data to
be transfer you use the blue

00:42:41.192 --> 00:42:43.194
tooth connection in order to
make the pairing and exchange

00:42:43.194 --> 00:42:45.196
some keys while you're
transferring data using a --

00:42:45.196 --> 00:42:47.198
proto call. Update for the use
of blue tooth for examples in

00:42:47.198 --> 00:42:49.200
museums or places where you need
to send little pieces of

00:42:49.200 --> 00:42:51.202
information of data in some
devices and this was done while

00:42:51.202 --> 00:42:53.204
passing -- well -- just sending
little pieces of information.

00:42:53.204 --> 00:42:55.139
From version 4 Bluetooth low
energy was introduce. Is called

00:42:55.139 --> 00:42:57.141
smart blue tooth it depends and
from version 4.1 they lower the

00:42:57.141 --> 00:42:59.143
consumption. Maybe you heard
about the low energy blue tooth

00:42:59.143 --> 00:43:01.145
as the proto call which is
consuming fuel power because the

00:43:01.145 --> 00:43:03.147
UT cycle has been improve and so
the discover time has been

00:43:03.147 --> 00:43:05.149
limited so the transfer is not
so long and you're lowering the

00:43:05.149 --> 00:43:07.151
-- from version 4.2 the data
packet of low energy has be

00:43:07.151 --> 00:43:09.153
reduce from 22 to 27 bytes to be
transfer. And we will talk about

00:43:09.153 --> 00:43:11.155
low energy -- and regarding blue
tooth. And the let start with

00:43:11.155 --> 00:43:13.157
blue now. It was establish in
the late 2013 but -- Lorry. Some

00:43:13.157 --> 00:43:15.159
papers will find online and
actually it is exploiting the

00:43:15.159 --> 00:43:17.161
old X proto call. And the goal
of this. This exploits you can

00:43:17.161 --> 00:43:19.163
make some ease gift request to
come on file at the time you

00:43:19.163 --> 00:43:21.165
apply this -- and pocket --
because the most common device

00:43:21.165 --> 00:43:23.167
with blue tooth enable and where
the devices you get some

00:43:23.167 --> 00:43:25.169
information exploiting this. And
if you get some get request.

00:43:25.169 --> 00:43:27.171
Sump as calendar or contacts you
know the name and the part and

00:43:27.171 --> 00:43:29.173
you actually for right passing
the security channel and just

00:43:29.173 --> 00:43:31.175
going through this of, changing
files so the user was not seeing

00:43:31.175 --> 00:43:33.177
any prompt on its device and no
authentication needed. Then I

00:43:33.177 --> 00:43:35.179
would -- nice exploit by -- and
where the we're lucky because he

00:43:35.179 --> 00:43:37.181
is sitting here right now and --
he will be glad I think to

00:43:37.181 --> 00:43:39.183
explain as more of course better
than me because the discover

00:43:39.183 --> 00:43:41.185
this. So it was present DEFCON
12 in -- it was regarding the

00:43:41.185 --> 00:43:43.187
blue tooth implementation of
iPhone. How many of you -- so

00:43:43.187 --> 00:43:45.189
few of you? No one of you
actually -- smart phone? >> Mark

00:43:45.189 --> 00:43:47.191
you don't count. >> Sorry. >>
Really? Bad thing because I

00:43:47.191 --> 00:43:49.193
remember when I was I think 13
years was the time. I'm young

00:43:49.193 --> 00:43:51.195
maybe I'm just 21. At the time I
was 13 or 14 years old and I

00:43:51.195 --> 00:43:53.197
remember it was funny to play
with those nice because they

00:43:53.197 --> 00:43:55.132
collect all the -- it was so
funny to hack your friend phone

00:43:55.132 --> 00:43:57.134
because when I leave their blue
tooth on and you just connect to

00:43:57.134 --> 00:43:59.136
them. It was possible to control
some device. Send an S MS to

00:43:59.136 --> 00:44:01.138
another number. Or calling other
people so when we were in school

00:44:01.138 --> 00:44:03.141
for example you were also to
bring their phone and like fuck

00:44:03.141 --> 00:44:05.143
what is happening right now and
the teacher, oh what are you

00:44:05.143 --> 00:44:07.145
doing with your phone. So fun.
So you were also able to down

00:44:07.145 --> 00:44:09.147
loan items. So sometimes you
were getting pictures, it was

00:44:09.147 --> 00:44:11.149
the first time smart phones had
camera. At the time we were --

00:44:11.149 --> 00:44:13.150
guys so it was not legal but for
just our fun you find some

00:44:13.150 --> 00:44:15.152
pictures of people and say, what
were you going with your mom or

00:44:15.152 --> 00:44:17.154
doing something in kitchen I
don't know. Hey I got this from

00:44:17.154 --> 00:44:19.156
you. How come? And it was so
fun. And so thank Lorian for --

00:44:19.156 --> 00:44:21.158
and another one I want to call
blue chop and it was useful to

00:44:21.158 --> 00:44:23.160
break the connection between
some devices and this was

00:44:23.160 --> 00:44:25.162
possible provided this master
device was supporting multiple

00:44:25.162 --> 00:44:27.165
connections. Peak connect and is
address and contact the master

00:44:27.165 --> 00:44:29.167
at the time. The master will
think. I have 2 devices the

00:44:29.167 --> 00:44:31.169
same, what the hell. And it will
update and then I will quote

00:44:31.169 --> 00:44:33.170
other known exploits like blue
bomb. In order in push the link

00:44:33.170 --> 00:44:35.172
but there are a lot of things I
will leave the reference if you

00:44:35.172 --> 00:44:37.174
want to, let say know more about
them. So a little bit

00:44:37.174 --> 00:44:39.177
explanation ability the pairing
and -- about -- and then I will

00:44:39.177 --> 00:44:41.179
leave for the new stuff. More
interesting and funny to hear.

00:44:41.179 --> 00:44:43.181
Okay. This is how the legacy
pairing procedure work before

00:44:43.181 --> 00:44:45.183
version 2.0. So there are two
devices. Initiated device and

00:44:45.183 --> 00:44:47.185
device B as responder. So -- I
want to connect you, this is my

00:44:47.185 --> 00:44:49.186
random number. And device --
thank you for giving me and just

00:44:49.186 --> 00:44:51.188
computer. The E 22 -- and it
takes as inputs the address of

00:44:51.188 --> 00:44:53.190
the bias B a pin number inserted
and the length of the pin and

00:44:53.190 --> 00:44:55.126
random previously created --
there is no check if the link

00:44:55.126 --> 00:44:57.128
created is the same. Actually
this check happens later when is

00:44:57.128 --> 00:44:59.130
the authentication procedure?
And at that time it works in

00:44:59.130 --> 00:45:01.132
this way. Just sends random
number to the claim meant. And

00:45:01.132 --> 00:45:03.134
-- device A which computes the
same exact applies the same

00:45:03.134 --> 00:45:05.136
exact and check it is if the two
are equals. This time if they

00:45:05.136 --> 00:45:07.138
are equals the authentication
happens. But this is the link

00:45:07.138 --> 00:45:09.140
previously generated but here a
lot of exploits. And after

00:45:09.140 --> 00:45:11.142
version 2.1 it comes the simple
pairs. Device A generates a

00:45:11.142 --> 00:45:13.144
number and device B makes it the
same. But another random number

00:45:13.144 --> 00:45:15.146
then they previous and this
pairing mechanism the two

00:45:15.146 --> 00:45:17.148
devices have already exchange --
PKA. So device B will send the

00:45:17.148 --> 00:45:19.150
result of this computation of
this -- to device A. And work

00:45:19.150 --> 00:45:21.152
welled and some result and
check. Each one computes a

00:45:21.152 --> 00:45:23.154
number and the users the last
step on their display they

00:45:23.154 --> 00:45:25.156
visualize the final number and
they have to say, okay, it is

00:45:25.156 --> 00:45:27.158
the same in both sides in order
to compare the pairing. The last

00:45:27.158 --> 00:45:29.160
thing about blue tooth energy.
There are 3 different keys to

00:45:29.160 --> 00:45:31.162
establish that connection and
the nice thing about this is

00:45:31.162 --> 00:45:33.164
that after the temporary key --
the way is generated is written

00:45:33.164 --> 00:45:35.166
in plain text. The problem is
that if I'm able to decrypt the

00:45:35.166 --> 00:45:37.168
PK I'm actually to get the start
term key and the long term key

00:45:37.168 --> 00:45:39.170
from this procedure and it is a
problem. If the pairing -- just

00:45:39.170 --> 00:45:41.172
works. The pairing -- the PK is
set to 0 so simple. If it is 6

00:45:41.172 --> 00:45:43.174
digit pin -- and it is can be
easily blue force using the --

00:45:43.174 --> 00:45:45.176
less than one second. EPT is out
of band it means is that the

00:45:45.176 --> 00:45:47.178
passage is transmitted in
spectrum band. It is not so

00:45:47.178 --> 00:45:49.180
easily to be detected. So I just
wrote, fuck yourself because it

00:45:49.180 --> 00:45:51.182
will be kind of impossible --
but never say never. So if we

00:45:51.182 --> 00:45:53.184
get the short term key and the
long term key and answer to all

00:45:53.184 --> 00:45:55.119
questions or -- so that's it for
this part. I will leave one

00:45:55.119 --> 00:45:57.121
sentence, my professor used to
say in his lecture. The out

00:45:57.121 --> 00:45:59.123
band, because if you are sure
you're fucking someone, the

00:45:59.123 --> 00:46:01.125
saying well you will never find
it. Look at your back because

00:46:01.125 --> 00:46:03.127
sometimes there someone who is
going to fuck before you so be

00:46:03.127 --> 00:46:05.129
careful doing this. So I leave
this, my friend. >> Okay. So --

00:46:05.129 --> 00:46:07.131
[ APPLAUSE ] >> Okay let's go on
some new stuff. So a little over

00:46:07.131 --> 00:46:09.133
view of what's smart lock is. Is
a -- introducing Android 5.0

00:46:09.133 --> 00:46:11.135
lollypop and it enables the user
to unlock his smart phone --

00:46:11.135 --> 00:46:13.137
this condition could be
locational lock where the user

00:46:13.137 --> 00:46:15.139
can set like Joe -- the Android
smart phone is automatically

00:46:15.139 --> 00:46:17.141
unlock. The device -- previously
safe -- and then we have the

00:46:17.141 --> 00:46:19.143
face unlock which is just your
metric face scanner of course

00:46:19.143 --> 00:46:21.145
and the safe must be saved
before. And then we have body

00:46:21.145 --> 00:46:23.147
unlock. I have no idea what it
is. The smart phone is in

00:46:23.147 --> 00:46:25.149
contact with a body not your
body. So your smart phone will

00:46:25.149 --> 00:46:27.151
be unlocked also with my hand.
Any way. And then we have the

00:46:27.151 --> 00:46:29.153
blue tooth unlock which we are
interesting now. So the blue

00:46:29.153 --> 00:46:31.155
tooth unlock maybe is the most
use feature when I'm in my car

00:46:31.155 --> 00:46:33.157
and I'm driving and I should not
text. I can bypass lock screen

00:46:33.157 --> 00:46:35.159
and text. And practically the
user must say okay I have this

00:46:35.159 --> 00:46:37.161
pair device and I can mark one
of them or more of them one or

00:46:37.161 --> 00:46:39.163
them as trusted and then from
this moment every time I am

00:46:39.163 --> 00:46:41.165
connected to this device I don't
have to do pin code, what's the

00:46:41.165 --> 00:46:43.167
problem. The problem is that in
Android version 5.1 the link --

00:46:43.167 --> 00:46:45.169
is not checked. What does that
mean? It means that I ever have

00:46:45.169 --> 00:46:47.171
previous safe connection. I mean
the link is not necessary for

00:46:47.171 --> 00:46:49.173
the connection. So basically out
of blue tooth unlock works. I

00:46:49.173 --> 00:46:51.175
have to initiate the connection
by the smart phone or blue tooth

00:46:51.175 --> 00:46:53.177
device itself and we have 2
possibilities. If the -- blue

00:46:53.177 --> 00:46:55.112
tooth device is known we do not
have to check link and get

00:46:55.112 --> 00:46:57.114
details from the device. Like
what kind of device is it or you

00:46:57.114 --> 00:46:59.116
know -- enable something like
that. Otherwise it is not known

00:46:59.116 --> 00:47:01.118
and we have to start
authentication process and then

00:47:01.118 --> 00:47:03.120
we can do all the other stuff
and then the connection. So from

00:47:03.120 --> 00:47:05.122
this picture you can see there
is only one thing we need to

00:47:05.122 --> 00:47:07.124
know to create a connection to
the Android device which is --

00:47:07.124 --> 00:47:09.126
Mac address. You just need to
know 4 bytes in blue tooth. The

00:47:09.126 --> 00:47:11.128
least significant in order to
establish the connection. We

00:47:11.128 --> 00:47:13.130
have 2 possible solutions. The
problem -- expensive and after

00:47:13.130 --> 00:47:15.132
all is not that good either.
Solution as some comes to

00:47:15.132 --> 00:47:17.134
require -- the victim. The
target can become aware of you

00:47:17.134 --> 00:47:19.136
which you try to -- your
computer and you need to

00:47:19.136 --> 00:47:21.138
authentication process no order
to get the 4 device of the net

00:47:21.138 --> 00:47:23.140
address. So we said the blue
force is low because the mac

00:47:23.140 --> 00:47:25.142
address cannot -- we have
establish a new connection with

00:47:25.142 --> 00:47:27.144
a new address and it takes time
each time. It is expensive

00:47:27.144 --> 00:47:29.146
because if we try to speed up
the process -- and create new

00:47:29.146 --> 00:47:31.148
connection with each and so we
have to buy all those numbers

00:47:31.148 --> 00:47:33.150
and as I said before is not a
good idea because we have 32

00:47:33.150 --> 00:47:35.152
bits of data is not possible
after all. And the other idea is

00:47:35.152 --> 00:47:37.154
sniffing. As I said before also
problems. Have you to be near

00:47:37.154 --> 00:47:39.156
the victim and in order you are
you're -- the connection to

00:47:39.156 --> 00:47:41.158
intercept and you need to
intercept an authentication

00:47:41.158 --> 00:47:43.160
process to get the whole
megabytes you need and is not

00:47:43.160 --> 00:47:45.162
that easy and the target can
become aware. Because you know

00:47:45.162 --> 00:47:47.164
we are not normal people. They
saw strange way. I mean if you

00:47:47.164 --> 00:47:49.166
are in Starbucks playing around
-- it can become a problem. I

00:47:49.166 --> 00:47:51.168
saw -- I won't become this guy.
[ LAUGHTER ] >> If anyone know

00:47:51.168 --> 00:47:53.170
who he is, please -- any, let's
go on. So our solution is like

00:47:53.170 --> 00:47:55.106
enable approach. We know another
thing about Android device. Also

00:47:55.106 --> 00:47:57.108
this thing is true for other
devices. Like in my car, Android

00:47:57.108 --> 00:47:59.110
automatically sends -- wireless
Wi-F solution and Android does

00:47:59.110 --> 00:48:01.112
the same thing. Sending out part
of your mac address. So since

00:48:01.112 --> 00:48:03.114
the trusted device must be
already been paired with the

00:48:03.114 --> 00:48:05.116
Android device the B con contain
-- so we can intercept those --

00:48:05.116 --> 00:48:07.118
retrieve free bytes with the mac
address -- more over the only

00:48:07.118 --> 00:48:09.120
the last byte we need is also
the part of the manufacture part

00:48:09.120 --> 00:48:11.122
of the mac address so the real
possibility are much way less.

00:48:11.122 --> 00:48:13.124
Okay know we have a little demo
showing you how it works. I'm

00:48:13.124 --> 00:48:15.126
sorry that the video is a little
messed up. I -- >> You fucked

00:48:15.126 --> 00:48:17.128
up. >> Yeah, I'm sorry. And we
recorded up that night so you

00:48:17.128 --> 00:48:19.130
know, Vegas, parties. Okay so I
tried to explain it. Okay so how

00:48:19.130 --> 00:48:21.132
does it start? I have this
Window solution. Just a second.

00:48:21.132 --> 00:48:23.134
Okay. Basically what we are
doing now okay, go on and back

00:48:23.134 --> 00:48:25.136
sorry. Okay. We have our mac
address for our computer and

00:48:25.136 --> 00:48:27.138
what you are doing now scanning
if there are some device

00:48:27.138 --> 00:48:29.140
actually we are looking for
specific device which is our my

00:48:29.140 --> 00:48:31.142
ahead phone. Come on. Okay. And
so the highlight mac address is

00:48:31.142 --> 00:48:33.144
my headphone -- with my ahead --
please. And okay so we need to

00:48:33.144 --> 00:48:35.146
spoof this address in order to
create a connection. So we use

00:48:35.146 --> 00:48:37.148
-- in order to do that and after
some glitch of the video we

00:48:37.148 --> 00:48:39.150
should see that the mac address
is now changing. Interface to

00:48:39.150 --> 00:48:41.152
apply the change and when you --
just to make yeah, the device

00:48:41.152 --> 00:48:43.154
the computer blue tooth visible
so they Android phone can scan

00:48:43.154 --> 00:48:45.156
us and try to connect. So we
start HCI down with just

00:48:45.156 --> 00:48:47.158
intercept and HCI pockets in
order to see what's going on and

00:48:47.158 --> 00:48:49.160
then from, this is my -- my
tablet --.0.1. And we start blue

00:48:49.160 --> 00:48:51.162
tooth get automatic connect my
tablet. Just a second. My tablet

00:48:51.162 --> 00:48:53.164
-- after the connection starts.
You can see tablet you let you

00:48:53.164 --> 00:48:55.099
see here at the bottom open and
I lost -- browse it and this

00:48:55.099 --> 00:48:57.101
works for a fix amount of time
and after that the Android

00:48:57.101 --> 00:48:59.103
device tries to send it out and
since the link is not the same

00:48:59.103 --> 00:49:01.105
because we do not have the same
link. The connection is dropped.

00:49:01.105 --> 00:49:03.107
Okay I got notification and here
we are. Pretty much -- so that's

00:49:03.107 --> 00:49:05.109
the way it works. Actually we
didn't root force anything

00:49:05.109 --> 00:49:07.111
because we did not have time to
create proof of concept. We will

00:49:07.111 --> 00:49:09.113
try to produce that in the near
future. Okay so is nice we only

00:49:09.113 --> 00:49:11.115
have one problem that our
Android device sends out -- out

00:49:11.115 --> 00:49:13.117
to fix it. When actually Android
5.0 has -- a nice feature from

00:49:13.117 --> 00:49:15.119
the last screen I can choose
which device I want to connect

00:49:15.119 --> 00:49:17.121
to so I can send B codes for
just device. So if I see a

00:49:17.121 --> 00:49:19.123
computer -- as Mark or something
that has more possibility. So

00:49:19.123 --> 00:49:21.125
another little demo for you
which actually just showed this

00:49:21.125 --> 00:49:23.127
thing. Let's open it works. Okay
so this is my computer with Uber

00:49:23.127 --> 00:49:25.129
tooth scanning. Intercepting --
from my smart phone I just

00:49:25.129 --> 00:49:27.131
enable blue tooth and we will
see that okay. We will see that

00:49:27.131 --> 00:49:29.133
automatically try to connect to
my headset and LAP which is the

00:49:29.133 --> 00:49:31.135
part of the free bytes of the
mac address we need to establish

00:49:31.135 --> 00:49:33.137
that connection. And now we need
of course one byte and this is

00:49:33.137 --> 00:49:35.139
done without the hand set near
the smart phone. So there is no

00:49:35.139 --> 00:49:37.141
need to have both of the devices
together. Okay so this is fixed

00:49:37.141 --> 00:49:39.143
actually in Android 5.1 I think.
Android security fixed it. So

00:49:39.143 --> 00:49:41.145
the link checked it. And by
there is problem because the API

00:49:41.145 --> 00:49:43.147
is not fix yet. So if your
Android device with a version

00:49:43.147 --> 00:49:45.149
prior 5.1 you have a smart
unlock feature. So don't enable

00:49:45.149 --> 00:49:47.151
it and otherwise the only the
API are -- so that means there

00:49:47.151 --> 00:49:49.153
no me today to check that the
blue tooth device and your

00:49:49.153 --> 00:49:51.155
Android device is in an encrypt
channel. There is no way to

00:49:51.155 --> 00:49:53.157
check that the link is correct.
We told Android -- check it is

00:49:53.157 --> 00:49:55.159
link and this is the method
actually. But is not present in

00:49:55.159 --> 00:49:57.161
the SDK yet and the -- so
actually thing they probably

00:49:57.161 --> 00:49:59.163
implemented in Android A or
probably whatever. So Android

00:49:59.163 --> 00:50:01.165
smart phone is fixed so we are
pretty face, right? No because

00:50:01.165 --> 00:50:03.167
we have third part application
and actually there is some

00:50:03.167 --> 00:50:05.169
application which use speaker,
smart unlock Android device. So

00:50:05.169 --> 00:50:07.171
if you don't have lollipop. You
can down load the application

00:50:07.171 --> 00:50:09.173
and set all the things so then
we're like, this video is really

00:50:09.173 --> 00:50:11.175
messed up I think we really
drunk, really drunk. You

00:50:11.175 --> 00:50:13.177
probably won't see any of that.
We should not tell them what

00:50:13.177 --> 00:50:15.179
time we recorded that video? >>
No? It was in the morning it was

00:50:15.179 --> 00:50:17.181
totally fine. >> I'm sorry I
tried to explain what you should

00:50:17.181 --> 00:50:19.183
see. Okay actually we have our
completely -- Coca Cola and

00:50:19.183 --> 00:50:21.185
start interface and we see that
the device -- so we just need to

00:50:21.185 --> 00:50:23.187
make the computer in visible to
other devices. That's what I'm

00:50:23.187 --> 00:50:25.189
talking about. Is what we were
seeing maybe. >> Don't say that.

00:50:25.189 --> 00:50:27.191
He was recording. Okay so wow.
Okay we put the device in

00:50:27.191 --> 00:50:29.193
visible mode and then we start
an HCI dam again to see what's

00:50:29.193 --> 00:50:31.195
going on and we move to my
tablet with Android.4.4

00:50:31.195 --> 00:50:33.197
something. Down load the blue
tooth it tried to automatically

00:50:33.197 --> 00:50:35.199
connect to the blue tooth. You
see? Very shitty video. We have

00:50:35.199 --> 00:50:37.201
the connection is terminated
right after that but we actually

00:50:37.201 --> 00:50:39.203
have time to unlock to tablet
and you know browse the video

00:50:39.203 --> 00:50:41.205
browse the photo. We have
picture, whatever. You know. Is

00:50:41.205 --> 00:50:43.207
not your device. So after that
the connection so drop the lock

00:50:43.207 --> 00:50:45.209
screen is enable again but if
you already unlock the device

00:50:45.209 --> 00:50:47.211
you can just don't lock it
again, browse it bring it hope

00:50:47.211 --> 00:50:49.213
and whatever. So okay, thank God
the video is over. And let's go

00:50:49.213 --> 00:50:51.215
to future works. >> Suggest a
few things about our future

00:50:51.215 --> 00:50:53.217
works. [ APPLAUSE ] >> Thank
you. >> Yeah. Okay, something

00:50:53.217 --> 00:50:55.152
about your future, as you know
probably the I of the word is

00:50:55.152 --> 00:50:57.154
growing up very fast and quick.
So if the devices are going to

00:50:57.154 --> 00:50:59.156
be more and more maybe they're
following something like more

00:50:59.156 --> 00:51:01.158
slowly. Everything is more
spread over the word and so we

00:51:01.158 --> 00:51:03.160
are focusing our next research.
Those devices. And by -- by the

00:51:03.160 --> 00:51:05.162
time right now we have some
concepts about smart locks which

00:51:05.162 --> 00:51:07.164
are those kinds of locks. >> Is
smart locks. >> Yeah. So please

00:51:07.164 --> 00:51:09.166
choose those locks for your
door. They're completely secure.

00:51:09.166 --> 00:51:11.168
Send us where you live and we
will make a check if is working.

00:51:11.168 --> 00:51:13.170
>> We can have dinner together.
>> Bring coffee yeah, so smart

00:51:13.170 --> 00:51:15.172
lock we have one and we just
bought. And we are going to

00:51:15.172 --> 00:51:17.174
spend some time on it and then
some other devices like -- band

00:51:17.174 --> 00:51:19.176
and like Joe band and fit these
bands that are working on low

00:51:19.176 --> 00:51:21.178
energy. So maybe you will see us
next month with new things I

00:51:21.178 --> 00:51:23.180
hope so and just want to thank
you for your patient and willing

00:51:23.180 --> 00:51:25.182
to come here and look at our --
>> Really thank you. >> And now

00:51:25.182 --> 00:51:27.184
is QA time. Q and A time, you
have to ask question, you know.

00:51:27.184 --> 00:51:29.186
>> Not go away time. >> Go turn
off your blue tooth. >> Question

00:51:29.186 --> 00:51:31.188
over there. Yeah the white paper
all this lights I think I won't

00:51:31.188 --> 00:51:33.190
put the videos but everything
else will be online. Probably on

00:51:33.190 --> 00:51:35.192
the DEFCON web site. Other
questions? Don't be shy. >> We

00:51:35.192 --> 00:51:37.194
got time for a couple of more
question but if you are leaving

00:51:37.194 --> 00:51:39.196
leave with the right through the
backside. Not this way. The

00:51:39.196 --> 00:51:41.198
right side. >> Can we have
microphone for that guy over

00:51:41.198 --> 00:51:43.200
there? I can't hear you sorry.
Oh. Windows phone. Is new brand

00:51:43.200 --> 00:51:45.202
you know? Sorry. Smart phone. Is
called Vanalock. And we both is

00:51:45.202 --> 00:51:47.204
quiet expensive I think. I paid
like 300 dollars or something

00:51:47.204 --> 00:51:49.206
like that but we actually try to
get some money to buy other

00:51:49.206 --> 00:51:51.208
locks as well. I don't remember
the other names but we want to

00:51:51.208 --> 00:51:53.210
try 3 to 4 locks. Some things we
have in mind. Anything else? O

00:51:53.210 --> 00:51:55.145
yes? Smart car? I never saw
smart car with blue tooth? >>

00:51:55.145 --> 00:51:57.147
You have one? Machine, sorry.
No. Because I'm poor I don't

00:51:57.147 --> 00:51:59.149
have a car. I'm joking I don't
have a car with the possibility

00:51:59.149 --> 00:52:01.151
to unlock it with blue tooth.
Yeah. Okay can we have a

00:52:01.151 --> 00:52:03.153
microphone, please? Because I'm
-- I can hear -- thank you. >>

00:52:03.153 --> 00:52:05.155
Have you guys worked with the
Apple home kit yet? They are

00:52:05.155 --> 00:52:07.157
trying like -- IOT stuff to
qualify for home kit? >> No we

00:52:07.157 --> 00:52:09.159
actually don't, sorry. >> I
recently ran across a new target

00:52:09.159 --> 00:52:11.161
for you guys, blue tooth vending
machines paying system for you.

00:52:11.161 --> 00:52:13.163
>> There is no vending machines
in Italy, sorry. >> There is one

00:52:13.163 --> 00:52:15.165
if you want to go mess around
with it in the comic -- >> Just

00:52:15.165 --> 00:52:17.167
give me the answer. >> Anybody
else? We will bring -- if there

00:52:17.167 --> 00:52:19.169
is any other questions. I'm not
done talking yet. Okay now you

00:52:19.169 --> 00:52:21.171
can clap. >> Thank you once
again.
