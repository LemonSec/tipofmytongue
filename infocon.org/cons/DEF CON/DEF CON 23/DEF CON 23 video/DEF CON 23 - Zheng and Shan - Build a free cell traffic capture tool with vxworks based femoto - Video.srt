00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.911
Hi. And welcome. In the
following hour we will talk

00:00:10.911 --> 00:00:21.822
about how to -- and how to
(audio blipped) and

00:00:21.822 --> 00:00:27.527
communication. Now, let me
introduce ourselves first. We

00:00:27.527 --> 00:00:39.540
are from -- and (muffled) we
also designed a lot of

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:53.720
interesting gadgets. Of course
we have a lot of -- and my name

00:00:53.720 --> 00:01:03.530
is Yuwei Zheng and I'm
interested in security embedded

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:15.542
systems (audio blipped) and the
blackberry is all my task in

00:01:15.542 --> 00:01:26.453
2011. And this is another
speaker, Haoqi Shan? >> Hi

00:01:26.453 --> 00:01:40.634
everyone. A lot of people so I'm
a little nervous. My name is

00:01:40.634 --> 00:01:54.815
Haoqi Shan and I'm a researcher
on the unicorn team. I have a

00:01:54.815 --> 00:02:04.624
bachelor degree of electronic
engineering this year. So a

00:02:04.624 --> 00:02:15.535
little bit of -- while I'm
hacking into some embedded

00:02:15.535 --> 00:02:27.547
device and some electronic
device. So I focus on the Wi-Fi

00:02:27.547 --> 00:02:38.458
hacking systems. Your routers
and switchers. Now let's take a

00:02:38.458 --> 00:02:50.470
look at this. Why do we
[indiscernible] from the cell. I

00:02:50.470 --> 00:03:01.381
believe you guys have seen --
hacking, the day before

00:03:01.381 --> 00:03:12.292
yesterday, what, yeah, so
Wednesday just - this vehicle is

00:03:12.292 --> 00:03:22.102
not in Wi-Fi (audio blipped)
connect through three generation

00:03:22.102 --> 00:03:36.283
or two generation. So if you
want to know what is going on,

00:03:36.283 --> 00:03:49.362
you need a Femoto cell. That is
useful advice. Besides when you

00:03:49.362 --> 00:04:01.374
want to do research on the
products that are integrated --

00:04:01.374 --> 00:04:16.656
the -- cell is the best choice
that you have. If you want to

00:04:16.656 --> 00:04:28.668
capture or hijack or modify the
FMS, the voice, the data

00:04:28.668 --> 00:04:42.849
traffic, you need it. So maybe
someone wants to ask why do you

00:04:42.849 --> 00:04:52.659
guys not just use
[indiscernible] such as open --

00:04:52.659 --> 00:05:09.009
or USRP or -- radio. Why not?
Because if you want to -- can do

00:05:09.009 --> 00:05:25.358
the -- hijacker but if you want
to know the FMS - if you wanted

00:05:25.358 --> 00:05:38.438
to modify the data traffic, it's
not okay. And it will access

00:05:38.438 --> 00:05:54.788
denied to the -- network. It has
no real up link or down link so

00:05:54.788 --> 00:06:08.969
you cannot hijack it. You can
know what is going in but you

00:06:08.969 --> 00:06:23.149
will know what is going out.
This is a familiar, this is --

00:06:23.149 --> 00:06:37.330
cells advantage. Now you have
the XS to the letter -- to the

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:49.342
network operators core network.
If you hack this, you can know

00:06:49.342 --> 00:07:00.253
what is going on, you can know
[indiscernible] and data

00:07:00.253 --> 00:07:13.333
traffic. You can capture it, you
can hijack it, you can modify

00:07:13.333 --> 00:07:26.413
it. Now you will have the
ability to - in the operator's

00:07:26.413 --> 00:07:37.324
network. You can hack their
switcher, you can hack their

00:07:37.324 --> 00:07:49.336
security gate way. If you are
good, you can hack everything.

00:07:49.336 --> 00:08:05.685
If you guys want to use -- in
research, such as you want to --

00:08:05.685 --> 00:08:18.765
a vehicle with a modem, you can
capture. Such as the FMS

00:08:18.765 --> 00:08:28.575
[indiscernible] that you can
modify the -- data. Well,

00:08:28.575 --> 00:08:40.587
actually some device that use
the data traffic will know that

00:08:40.587 --> 00:08:58.037
-- if it's connected with a true
or fake -- this is a real -- so

00:08:58.037 --> 00:09:08.948
you can bypass it. And besides
the data traffic [indiscernible]

00:09:08.948 --> 00:09:25.298
you can find some spots and now
you can fix it or just hack it.

00:09:25.298 --> 00:09:41.648
How can I get this free from the
cell? In China it's a little bit

00:09:41.648 --> 00:09:53.660
difficult to buy one. According
to some policy they won't allow

00:09:53.660 --> 00:10:08.942
you to buy it. If you want to
buy it, it's illegal. We can

00:10:08.942 --> 00:10:18.751
[indiscernible]. Let's just use
reverse engineering. In China if

00:10:18.751 --> 00:10:34.033
you guys -- that will have not
-- signals, we can make a phone

00:10:34.033 --> 00:10:47.113
call to a customer's device and
you will tell them, hi, ma'am,

00:10:47.113 --> 00:11:01.294
kind of like a phone call to my
home. What is going on?

00:11:01.294 --> 00:11:12.205
[indiscernible] you can just
make a call again and again.

00:11:12.205 --> 00:11:25.285
Finally in the end you can make
a complaint to the management

00:11:25.285 --> 00:11:36.195
department. This department will
say, yes, they should solve the

00:11:36.195 --> 00:11:44.904
problem. And finally, sir,
please [indiscernible] from the

00:11:44.904 --> 00:11:56.916
cell and it's free. And you can
make your network signal's

00:11:56.916 --> 00:12:12.198
quality better. So now we have
one -- to let's hack it - about

00:12:12.198 --> 00:12:18.738
these things, [indiscernible]
Wi-Fi and absolutely,

00:12:18.738 --> 00:12:30.750
apparently, one port and two
lamp posts. This is the most

00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:40.560
important thing, configuration
IP. And the routers, 197.1 and

00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:50.370
the [indiscernible] IPEs,
197.241. Well, you guys can see

00:12:50.370 --> 00:13:02.382
that absolutely, the most
important IPs is the home ID IP.

00:13:02.382 --> 00:13:15.461
This is the signal that you can
configure. That's a quick and

00:13:15.461 --> 00:13:28.541
simple [indiscernible]. Let's
map it. We got a lot of -- it's

00:13:28.541 --> 00:13:36.182
interesting. Just
[indiscernible] it comes up --

00:13:36.182 --> 00:13:44.891
[indiscernible] operating
system. The first thing is just

00:13:44.891 --> 00:13:54.701
enemy router. That's wrong. And
something interesting is the

00:13:54.701 --> 00:14:04.510
[indiscernible] (muffled) longer
and longer time. So forgot about

00:14:04.510 --> 00:14:19.792
the -- try it another way. Well,
according to -- you can just -

00:14:19.792 --> 00:14:30.703
something more about it. It's a
real-time operating system used

00:14:30.703 --> 00:14:40.513
a lot in military device,
medication device, just, you

00:14:40.513 --> 00:14:54.694
know -- welshing of course it's
not open source. So it's hard to

00:14:54.694 --> 00:15:05.605
break it. Well, just Google it.
Just two [indiscernible] that

00:15:05.605 --> 00:15:19.786
comes out -- let's try -- ut-oh,
you will know that the last

00:15:19.786 --> 00:15:32.865
three years and before the last
three years, also at DEFCON the

00:15:32.865 --> 00:15:47.046
-- fell and it was modified a
lot. It looked similar to this

00:15:47.046 --> 00:16:01.227
one. But in a very different
sense. There is -- and you can

00:16:01.227 --> 00:16:15.408
just run a module and get in
here. But it's pretty hard. This

00:16:15.408 --> 00:16:28.487
is a -- a different -- much
harder. Remember the portal that

00:16:28.487 --> 00:16:40.499
we just scanned, there will be a
[indiscernible]. Will have the

00:16:40.499 --> 00:16:54.680
-- just use the -- and try it.
This doesn't work. Of course,

00:16:54.680 --> 00:17:05.591
this as well was --
[indiscernible] of course to --

00:17:05.591 --> 00:17:20.873
version, well, it fell again. So
what is going on? We just try it

00:17:20.873 --> 00:17:33.953
another way. We disassemble this
and see what's in here and try

00:17:33.953 --> 00:17:49.235
to modify it and - to analysis.
And this is the two parts. The

00:17:49.235 --> 00:18:01.247
home and the [indiscernible].
Contents of the -- and across -

00:18:01.247 --> 00:18:13.259
if you guys want a hacker
embedded device, you know that

00:18:13.259 --> 00:18:27.440
-- lots of device that have bug
ports. So the developer can just

00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:41.621
develop them and bug it through
this portal. What we do is find

00:18:41.621 --> 00:18:57.970
out -- it's on the board. And I
will tell you this is the bug

00:18:57.970 --> 00:19:13.252
board. It will say this is TX,
this is RX. So you can simply

00:19:13.252 --> 00:19:27.433
connect it with your laptop. USB
to - several ports. So you just

00:19:27.433 --> 00:19:37.243
connect to the port with a
laptop. It's just

00:19:37.243 --> 00:19:49.255
[indiscernible]. Of course,
let's just use it. And a lot of

00:19:49.255 --> 00:20:04.537
information -- device is -- this
is 6.8. You can see it tells you

00:20:04.537 --> 00:20:16.549
(audio blipped) you can apply
simple steps. Now just use it.

00:20:16.549 --> 00:20:27.460
Thank you. Let's just, well our
nature is help or

00:20:27.460 --> 00:20:37.269
[indiscernible] list and say
what commands we can use.

00:20:37.269 --> 00:20:50.349
Apparently some -- you see it,
you will know which one is

00:20:50.349 --> 00:21:02.361
important. The changeable -- and
the -- well of course, (muffled)

00:21:02.361 --> 00:21:12.171
copy memory. Memory is
everything, right? So you can

00:21:12.171 --> 00:21:25.251
just take a quick look. Press P
and enter. Well here comes

00:21:25.251 --> 00:21:39.431
something else. We try it. This
-- is nothing. Let's see the --

00:21:39.431 --> 00:21:53.612
structure. A lot of things, and
apparently I use days to say --

00:21:53.612 --> 00:22:07.793
which means what. Can we use it
and how large is it. Well

00:22:07.793 --> 00:22:16.502
[indiscernible], really
terrible. And well, now I can

00:22:16.502 --> 00:22:29.582
tell you that this is the most
important thing, in my world.

00:22:29.582 --> 00:22:37.223
[indiscernible] the
configuration file. And the user

00:22:37.223 --> 00:22:51.403
one is the -- the system and
your router and -- number. And

00:22:51.403 --> 00:23:06.685
the two is -- [indiscernible],
give us a little bit of -- so we

00:23:06.685 --> 00:23:18.697
can't just put in another
structure. And back up, a back

00:23:18.697 --> 00:23:35.047
up virus. We don't have a lot of
ways to hack it. So -- from

00:23:35.047 --> 00:23:47.059
there and -- system and analysis
the system. Here are those

00:23:47.059 --> 00:23:57.970
things, how do we validate. From
where. Memory use the

00:23:57.970 --> 00:24:08.881
[indiscernible] just a simple
test, we upgrade, up load and

00:24:08.881 --> 00:24:23.062
download. It looks fine. We know
the past which is the CP, and

00:24:23.062 --> 00:24:38.344
one by one. You can -- write a
simple script. Not like me, I

00:24:38.344 --> 00:24:47.052
just type. According to our
work, [indiscernible] most

00:24:47.052 --> 00:25:01.233
important. Now this might -- >>
Okay. From the MP3 -- we can

00:25:01.233 --> 00:25:12.144
guess that maybe I compress the
-- but, (audio blipped)

00:25:12.144 --> 00:25:23.055
information, I got nothing.
After -- doing research, I found

00:25:23.055 --> 00:25:36.135
-- what is an -- [indiscernible]
or compress or deflate all of

00:25:36.135 --> 00:25:50.315
them. But even though we --
plate, what I -- error. Got the

00:25:50.315 --> 00:26:04.496
05050 from the header. The next
-- I guess it's the length. This

00:26:04.496 --> 00:26:16.508
length plus -- equal to the file
length. After we --

00:26:16.508 --> 00:26:26.318
[indiscernible] to decompress
it. And now, let's examine ...

00:26:26.318 --> 00:26:37.229
Thank you. Now, let's examine
the -- and -- (muffled)

00:26:37.229 --> 00:26:51.410
contained a lot of literal --
and it's a success. Now, we can

00:26:51.410 --> 00:27:00.118
analyze somewhere -- binary.
It's not contained any

00:27:00.118 --> 00:27:08.827
information about the location
and the linking information.

00:27:08.827 --> 00:27:25.177
From the -- here, we can use a
command to load the, we can see

00:27:25.177 --> 00:27:38.257
-- able to say 010000. This is
the -- [indiscernible]. Is cued

00:27:38.257 --> 00:27:53.539
from. And now we can load in --
and address say 010, 0000. And

00:27:53.539 --> 00:28:03.348
difficult. Find the information
difficult. I finally -- to

00:28:03.348 --> 00:28:14.259
create -- why [indiscernible]
have been encoding the basic 64

00:28:14.259 --> 00:28:27.339
-- after, 72 binary. (muffled)?
>> So sorry. It's not ours. Here

00:28:27.339 --> 00:28:40.419
we're trying to bring out own
laptop. Our laptop that kind of

00:28:40.419 --> 00:28:53.498
come to America. We should buy
one, buy a Mac. Sorry. Almost

00:28:53.498 --> 00:29:06.578
done. We are back. Okay. Now the
-- file - and [indiscernible]

00:29:06.578 --> 00:29:24.029
256 and 32 bytes. So maybe - FHA
to -- one to eight. We will try

00:29:24.029 --> 00:29:37.109
one to eight. Sometimes we don't
have good luck. Each one --

00:29:37.109 --> 00:29:49.121
which -- work. Somewhere. They
had to change the password and

00:29:49.121 --> 00:29:58.930
the -- decoding. [indiscernible]
have to -- this configuration,

00:29:58.930 --> 00:30:13.111
it's one thing. Have to get the
original hash code and the --

00:30:13.111 --> 00:30:27.292
and then compare the two. So we
got the -- instructions. Run to

00:30:27.292 --> 00:30:40.372
the. Here we have -- and patch
somewhere and the -- will

00:30:40.372 --> 00:30:53.452
compress it. The header length.
We can also use - patch method.

00:30:53.452 --> 00:31:04.362
Compress the -- to the memory.
And then a commander.

00:31:04.362 --> 00:31:12.003
Instruction from the
[indiscernible]. FE8. You can

00:31:12.003 --> 00:31:25.083
actually -- we can get the --
and -- [indiscernible]. We can

00:31:25.083 --> 00:31:40.365
get the -- let's capture the --
try to analyze it. We can use

00:31:40.365 --> 00:31:53.445
the computer to -- (muffled) to
capture the -- in realtime, now.

00:31:53.445 --> 00:32:06.525
Now -- we can view the -- open
the packet. (audio blipped).

00:32:06.525 --> 00:32:21.807
Here, I got it. It's really hard
to see. It's recording. It's a a

00:32:21.807 --> 00:32:34.886
big packet. We just captured two
days and all our neighbors, we

00:32:34.886 --> 00:32:45.797
can all see. Decoded. You may
say [indiscernible] maybe it's

00:32:45.797 --> 00:32:56.708
going to crash it. And it's
encrypted with -- de-corrupted.

00:32:56.708 --> 00:33:07.619
[indiscernible] I think it's --
and now, de-corrupting it. That

00:33:07.619 --> 00:33:21.800
is the -- you need to find which
protocol -- change the protocol.

00:33:21.800 --> 00:33:35.981
And after decoding the protocol
we can analyze the -- and GPS is

00:33:35.981 --> 00:33:49.060
replaced with -- protocol. So --
decoder. This is the way we

00:33:49.060 --> 00:34:02.140
capture it. >> Here is my
version. Which one is this one?

00:34:02.140 --> 00:34:18.490
Let's have a look at -- we can
see the details. We can show you

00:34:18.490 --> 00:34:32.671
already -- well, here is the --
itself. Beside that -- you guys

00:34:32.671 --> 00:34:49.020
can have my phone number and now
you can hack me. You can see --

00:34:49.020 --> 00:34:59.931
well, now we are capturing the
data, grows, grows, grows.

00:34:59.931 --> 00:35:15.213
That's just a tab for JSM/JSM.
Well, here it is. Now we can see

00:35:15.213 --> 00:35:29.394
the details. Of course I have a
video about how to capture the

00:35:29.394 --> 00:35:43.575

something, you can -- you have
the PowerPoint and my email. You

00:36:10.835 --> 00:36:25.016

of your questions. And I

00:36:25.016 --> 00:36:35.927
apologize for my -- according to
some policy [indiscernible] and

00:36:35.927 --> 00:36:50.108
I'm really sorry about that. So

Okay? ...(applause)... Let me

00:37:01.019 --> 00:37:16.301
show you my email. This is okay.
You have a PDF. Here is our

can buy things or just ask me a

00:37:46.865 --> 00:00:00.000

Thank you.
