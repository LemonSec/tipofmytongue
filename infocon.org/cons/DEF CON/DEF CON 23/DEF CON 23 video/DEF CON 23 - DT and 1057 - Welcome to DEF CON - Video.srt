00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:11.512
How you guys doing? Yeah.

00:00:11.512 --> 00:00:12.813
[Laughter] Okay So I know its

00:00:12.813 --> 00:00:15.048
Friday morning and for a lot of
you this is the first day of the

00:00:15.048 --> 00:00:16.884
con, but like I people in the
room working on the crypto

00:00:16.884 --> 00:00:20.554
puzzle stuff last night until
about 4:00 this morning so bear

00:00:20.554 --> 00:00:26.059
with me. You'll notice that I
have a liaison for DT here with

00:00:26.059 --> 00:00:33.000
me. Her thing will be that she
spoke at DEF CON before she was

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:40.107
1. [ Laughter ] She does have a
goon bag, though.

00:00:40.107 --> 00:00:43.911
[ Applause ]

00:00:43.911 --> 00:00:51.952
So anyway. Her hacker handle is
Super Nova.

00:00:51.952 --> 00:00:55.455
So if mom can come
in and take her.

00:00:55.455 --> 00:00:56.156
[no audio]

00:00:56.156 --> 00:00:57.558
[no audio]

00:00:57.558 --> 00:00:59.159
So thank you 
guys all for coming out How

00:00:59.159 --> 00:01:01.962
many of you by the show of hands
this is your first DEF CON?

00:01:01.962 --> 00:01:05.465
Raise your hand. Man, every
single year it is like this huge

00:01:05.465 --> 00:01:08.402
amount. My only guestimation is
that you only go to opening

00:01:08.402 --> 00:01:10.637
ceremonies one year unless you
want to hear about the badges.

00:01:10.637 --> 00:01:16.877
So normally we do -- >>
Screaming! >> What! >> ( Speaker

00:01:16.877 --> 00:01:24.484
off microphone ). >> It is
pinned onto my shirt, how am I

00:01:24.484 --> 00:01:31.558
going to? [ Laughter ] And I
don't mean to be offensive but

00:01:31.558 --> 00:01:36.296
-- hello? Better? [ Applause ]
All you guys in the back, can

00:01:36.296 --> 00:01:38.332
you hear me? [ Applause ] All
right. So we're going to do

00:01:38.332 --> 00:01:41.468
something that we do every year,
we do a little intro video, but

00:01:41.468 --> 00:01:50.477
first of all, you guys are way
too quiet, this is the opening

00:01:50.477 --> 00:02:00.921
ceremonies for DEF CON, how is
everybody? [ Applause ] >> What?

00:02:00.921 --> 00:02:04.691
[ Video playing ] >> That was
again, this must be some kind of

00:02:04.691 --> 00:02:10.864
pathetic truth. Master,
inquisitive servant -- could it

00:02:10.864 --> 00:02:16.636
be? ∂ [ Music ] ∂ This would not
imagine parents of mine seeking

00:02:16.636 --> 00:02:23.777
a connect accidental dot of
bloodlines. This was something

00:02:23.777 --> 00:02:28.048
real. ∂ [ Music ] ∂ Something --
it is simply to be dangerous (

00:02:28.048 --> 00:02:31.485
Speaker off microphone ).
Deniable in all its obscured

00:02:31.485 --> 00:02:38.058
profession. ( Speaker off
microphone ). ∂ [ Music ] ∂ Oh,

00:02:38.058 --> 00:02:44.564
there are others who deserve
this conspicuousness. Able to

00:02:44.564 --> 00:03:04.518
untangle this perplexity
understood this cipher that

00:03:04.518 --> 00:03:08.822
surrounds this key. ∂ [ Music ]
∂ [ End of video ] >> So I would

00:03:08.822 --> 00:03:15.796
like to officially welcome -- [
Laughter ] Everybody to DEF CON

00:03:15.796 --> 00:03:21.401
23. [ Applause ] And look who
showed up. Everybody say hi,

00:03:21.401 --> 00:03:31.545
Russ. >> Hi, Russ! >> So Russ is
a tiny bopper. He is at DEF CON.

00:03:31.545 --> 00:03:34.281
Do you want to say hi? ] >> Hi!
>> Hi! >> All right. Have a good

00:03:34.281 --> 00:03:38.018
time while you're here. If you
need anything, ask the red

00:03:38.018 --> 00:03:41.655
shirt. Ah, Lost is amazing. He's
not going to tell you, even 20%

00:03:41.655 --> 00:03:45.425
of what he's done for this
conference this year find all

00:03:45.425 --> 00:03:49.896
the secrets. Uncover all the
challenges. Make it happen. Have

00:03:49.896 --> 00:03:52.599
a fantastic time. And please be
safe. One thing I will tell you,

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:55.335
this is Vegas, keep your wallets
and phones in your front

00:03:55.335 --> 00:03:58.538
pockets. Don't leave your bags
lying around. We already had a

00:03:58.538 --> 00:04:02.375
couple people that have had
incidents in other places in the

00:04:02.375 --> 00:04:04.945
hotel. Don't make yourself a
victim. Be smart. Okay? If you

00:04:04.945 --> 00:04:12.319
need anything, holler.
Otherwise, let's have a great

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:17.157
time and, ah, thank you, Russ,
for everything you do. [

00:04:17.157 --> 00:04:19.993
Applause ] >> Thank you. All
right. So I can -- bear with me.

00:04:19.993 --> 00:04:23.296
It's ah, Friday morning, but it
feels like, ah, Sunday -- after

00:04:23.296 --> 00:04:26.299
con -- if any of you have been
here. Again, so a lot of you

00:04:26.299 --> 00:04:30.203
this is your first DEF CON. How
many came here not knowing what

00:04:30.203 --> 00:04:32.873
the hell to expect? Raise your
hand? Be honest. How many of you

00:04:32.873 --> 00:04:35.308
had pretty good idea what you
were getting yourselves into?

00:04:35.308 --> 00:04:39.146
How many of you are like -- I'm
just here to like party and

00:04:39.146 --> 00:04:42.849
drink and hang out? [ Laughter ]
Oh, so I did, how many of you

00:04:42.849 --> 00:04:45.952
came to my 101 talk yesterday,
just out of curiosity? Okay. So

00:04:45.952 --> 00:04:48.722
I apologize, there's a few real
quick things that I'm going

00:04:48.722 --> 00:04:51.057
reiterate for the other folks
here. First of all, I do this

00:04:51.057 --> 00:04:53.827
every time from another
conference that I attend. We do

00:04:53.827 --> 00:04:57.430
a thing called human search
engine. So I'd like to just help

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:00.867
some folks out. How many of you
guys in the audience are

00:05:00.867 --> 00:05:03.637
students? Raise your hands. How
many of you are in high school?

00:05:03.637 --> 00:05:10.076
College? How many are freshly
out of college and looking for

00:05:10.076 --> 00:05:14.848
work? How many are not freshly
out of college and looking for

00:05:14.848 --> 00:05:18.285
work here at DEF CON? Okay. So
hold on. Everybody -- now, how

00:05:18.285 --> 00:05:21.254
many of you out there are here
to hire somebody? Okay. So I'll

00:05:21.254 --> 00:05:24.090
do that one more time. How many
of you are here looking for a

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:30.063
job? Raise your hand. How many
are here trying to hire

00:05:30.063 --> 00:05:32.999
somebody? How you guys talk
amongst yourselves. [ Laughter ]

00:05:32.999 --> 00:05:36.570
Okay? [ Laughter ] You're
welcome. So my name is Ryan. I

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:40.707
know by 1057, yes it is a
palindrome in binary. Write it

00:05:40.707 --> 00:05:43.476
out. There's also the solution
in the first mission challenge.

00:05:43.476 --> 00:05:45.879
So no big ceremonies we just
kind of like to welcome you.

00:05:45.879 --> 00:05:49.316
Kind of set the tone for the
conference. Um, primarily I

00:05:49.316 --> 00:05:52.419
discuss what went into going on
with the creation of the, the,

00:05:52.419 --> 00:05:55.555
the puzzle challenge and the
badges. As well as, I try and

00:05:55.555 --> 00:05:58.758
direct my talks towards what you
guys want to hear about. Um,

00:05:58.758 --> 00:06:02.596
most of the time, though, I get
asked questions over and over

00:06:02.596 --> 00:06:06.666
about the badges. So ah, why we
did what we did. Why the design

00:06:06.666 --> 00:06:11.338
is like it is. Etc., etc. So
with, ah, without further ado,

00:06:11.338 --> 00:06:13.974
let's get going. How many of you
recognize that picture? >> Yeah!

00:06:13.974 --> 00:06:17.310
>> Yeah! So that's from a movie
-- "This Island Earth" it was

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:21.047
riffed by the MFC3K guys, and
that wonderful contraption you

00:06:21.047 --> 00:06:26.253
see in front of you called what?
>> ( Speaker off microphone ).

00:06:26.253 --> 00:06:29.890
>> It is the interocitor. Okay?
So, in that, in that, in that

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:31.725
sci-fi movie, these aliens sent
these scientists all these parts

00:06:31.725 --> 00:06:34.261
in a manual that was hard to
decipher. And they had to

00:06:34.261 --> 00:06:37.063
assemble this machine in the --
not knowing what the purpose of

00:06:37.063 --> 00:06:39.966
the machine was. And at the end,
at the end result was they built

00:06:39.966 --> 00:06:43.303
this machine and they could
communicate with these, with

00:06:43.303 --> 00:06:45.639
these aliens, but it was kind of
like a test, much like last star

00:06:45.639 --> 00:06:47.841
fighter-type thing. So I kind of
look at the puzzle and crypto

00:06:47.841 --> 00:06:49.943
challenge that I'm doing this
year is kind of a test. And

00:06:49.943 --> 00:06:52.812
anyone that actually is
competing will discover how true

00:06:52.812 --> 00:06:56.783
that really is, because there is
a side tangent that will happen

00:06:56.783 --> 00:07:03.356
in the crypto puzzle challenge
this year that I have never done

00:07:03.356 --> 00:07:06.192
before. So I made this point
yesterday and I'm going to make

00:07:06.192 --> 00:07:11.364
it again. And, and this, this
terrified me. I'm not going to

00:07:11.364 --> 00:07:13.233
lie. When I asked this question
in the 10 one section yesterday

00:07:13.233 --> 00:07:15.635
and, I'm only like a few people
raised their hand it freaked me

00:07:15.635 --> 00:07:17.504
out. How many of you people know
a ( Indiscernible )? When I say

00:07:17.504 --> 00:07:20.907
that, when I refer to that with
what's going on right now. How

00:07:20.907 --> 00:07:23.209
many are concerned about that?
Now, every person in this room,

00:07:23.209 --> 00:07:26.346
if you're involved with
security, should have raised

00:07:26.346 --> 00:07:29.949
their hand. So it is a very
tongue-and-cheek poke at the

00:07:29.949 --> 00:07:32.886
fact that I am very concerned
about things, ah, you saw my

00:07:32.886 --> 00:07:36.256
beautiful daughter that was up
here, I want her to grow up in a

00:07:36.256 --> 00:07:39.726
world where she is free to
explore and to tinker and not go

00:07:39.726 --> 00:07:42.629
to jail if she decides that her
career path is to be a security

00:07:42.629 --> 00:07:45.298
researcher. I don't want her to
go to jail for trying to make

00:07:45.298 --> 00:07:49.669
systems better I want her to
have to deal with back doors and

00:07:49.669 --> 00:07:53.106
crypto systems which is first of
all, if there is any aero folks

00:07:53.106 --> 00:07:56.176
here, it is not going to happen.
It's not, because people just

00:07:56.176 --> 00:07:59.279
move offshore, the companies
aren't going to do it. People

00:07:59.279 --> 00:08:02.182
aren't going to put up with
that. But anyway -- >> ( Speaker

00:08:02.182 --> 00:08:05.352
off microphone ). >> Am I not
talking loud enough? I'm going

00:08:05.352 --> 00:08:07.954
to go -- someone in the back say
that they cannot hear me. Can

00:08:07.954 --> 00:08:13.059
you guys in the back row hear
me? >> ( Speaker off microphone

00:08:13.059 --> 00:08:15.362
). >> They say yes. So go screw
yourself. No, I'm just kidding.

00:08:15.362 --> 00:08:16.996
[ Laughter ] So the big joke,
HAHA. You have all come to DEF

00:08:16.996 --> 00:08:21.234
CON this year, and
congratulations, you now all for

00:08:21.234 --> 00:08:25.205
a record. Ah -- you can throw
the tomatoes now, but you should

00:08:25.205 --> 00:08:27.807
care about waist. If I mention
that and you don't know what I'm

00:08:27.807 --> 00:08:31.711
talking about, I would suggest
that's after you go home, maybe

00:08:31.711 --> 00:08:34.881
not here, start Googling it.
Look it up, be concerned. Become

00:08:34.881 --> 00:08:37.117
active. That's why we're here.
People in this community are the

00:08:37.117 --> 00:08:41.888
only ones that are going to be
able to have a voice to fix

00:08:41.888 --> 00:08:46.092
this. So how many of you -- [
Low audio ] In DEF CON expecting

00:08:46.092 --> 00:08:49.996
an electronic badge? How many of
you are familiar with our

00:08:49.996 --> 00:08:53.633
every-other-year policy? Okay.
So those who came expecting an

00:08:53.633 --> 00:08:55.802
electronic badge, we only do
that every other year. And the

00:08:55.802 --> 00:08:58.972
reason for that, is back when
Joe first started doing

00:08:58.972 --> 00:09:01.374
electronic badges it was kind of
a new thing. Now, every fricking

00:09:01.374 --> 00:09:04.611
conference on the face of the
planet has an electronic badge.

00:09:04.611 --> 00:09:08.314
And we try to keep the changed
up, by the way, it really forces

00:09:08.314 --> 00:09:11.051
you to think creatively to come
up with solutions to a problem

00:09:11.051 --> 00:09:14.888
-- people that heard me
yesterday, it is a little joke

00:09:14.888 --> 00:09:18.425
for you. So we do a
nonelectronic badge every other

00:09:18.425 --> 00:09:20.827
year. And actually have more
people tell me as far as the

00:09:20.827 --> 00:09:23.730
cryptographic puzzles and
everything else, that they

00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:26.566
actually enjoy it more. And for
those who never worn a circuit

00:09:26.566 --> 00:09:28.968
board on their shirt that hasn't
been fabricated properly, I had

00:09:28.968 --> 00:09:31.938
a number of people this year
say, yes. They're large, they're

00:09:31.938 --> 00:09:34.741
seven inches, they're not the
largest badge we've ever had,

00:09:34.741 --> 00:09:37.110
and as a non-electronic badge,
they don't mess up your T-shirt

00:09:37.110 --> 00:09:40.246
because you're not rubbing cut
traces on the back of your

00:09:40.246 --> 00:09:42.982
stomach. All day. But anyway, I
have also heard a number of

00:09:42.982 --> 00:09:45.218
comments. Oh, we don't know how
to hook this up. Come on,

00:09:45.218 --> 00:09:48.688
people, it is a hacker
conference and you're

00:09:48.688 --> 00:09:52.659
complaining that you don't know
how to adapt? Remember, we're

00:09:52.659 --> 00:09:56.329
building, we're building our
interocitor here. So that, those

00:09:56.329 --> 00:09:59.999
are all of the record badges
that were produced this year.

00:09:59.999 --> 00:10:04.070
When they were shipped here to
the hotel, the palettes weighed

00:10:04.070 --> 00:10:07.140
over two tons because of the
amount of vinyl that was

00:10:07.140 --> 00:10:10.844
involved in these. These are
actually vinyl. Um, the, the --

00:10:10.844 --> 00:10:13.947
it took hunting fabrication
houses to find somebody that

00:10:13.947 --> 00:10:16.950
could do an order large enough
to produce this much vinyl,

00:10:16.950 --> 00:10:19.786
because nobody's doing vinyl
anymore. And by the way, you can

00:10:19.786 --> 00:10:21.721
notice that the younger people
in the audience will be holding

00:10:21.721 --> 00:10:25.792
these like this -- [ Laughter ]
And the older people in the

00:10:25.792 --> 00:10:28.695
audience will be holding them
like this. [ Laughter ] -- or

00:10:28.695 --> 00:10:32.966
like this. And so you can kind
of gauge people's age, ah, by

00:10:32.966 --> 00:10:37.036
how they're holding this. And by
the way, if anyone, ah, has not

00:10:37.036 --> 00:10:39.138
yet had a chance to hear them,
we're going to put record

00:10:39.138 --> 00:10:41.107
players at, ah, the info booth.
There will be some in my room

00:10:41.107 --> 00:10:44.110
with the USB adapter, too, but
you're welcome to come plug your

00:10:44.110 --> 00:10:47.947
laptop into my USB device. [
Laughter ] And record the audio

00:10:47.947 --> 00:10:50.850
off of these disks if you want,
but I'm sure a number of people

00:10:50.850 --> 00:10:53.920
in the crypto challenge have
already ripped the audio and put

00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:56.723
the files on mine, if you have
not yet heard them. I would also

00:10:56.723 --> 00:11:03.496
like to say thank you to Dual
Core. Everybody give them a

00:11:03.496 --> 00:11:06.966
hand. [ Applause ] Ah, Dual
Core, graciously allowed us to

00:11:06.966 --> 00:11:12.939
use the hack, to hack all of the
theme song, which is the "B"

00:11:12.939 --> 00:11:17.610
side of your record, by the way.
So off-the-record, another

00:11:17.610 --> 00:11:20.480
question I have already is why
the small and not the large of

00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:23.683
the 45. Anyone who has actually
played these yet realizes that

00:11:23.683 --> 00:11:30.723
these are actually recorded or
etched, pressed at a 33 speed,

00:11:30.723 --> 00:11:33.826
not 45. So we could fit more on
it. Cool? Everybody happy?

00:11:33.826 --> 00:11:39.365
You're all quiet. Yeah. It's
like Friday morning. You guys

00:11:39.365 --> 00:11:42.802
are like already tired? So um. [
Laughter ] Anybody know the

00:11:42.802 --> 00:11:46.472
quote? >> ( Speaker off
microphone ). >> Yes? No? Fuck

00:11:46.472 --> 00:11:49.509
bronzi? Yes. So let's talking
about the ‹ber badge. Because

00:11:49.509 --> 00:11:52.979
this is the one that I'm really
excited about this year. How

00:11:52.979 --> 00:11:56.249
many of you have no clue what I
mean when I say ‹ber badge. Tell

00:11:56.249 --> 00:11:58.484
the truth? How many of you heard
the term black badge? Okay. So

00:11:58.484 --> 00:12:00.920
black badge and ‹ber badge have
the same thing. The actual

00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:04.591
official title is ‹ber badge. So
we do this thing at DEF CON. We

00:12:04.591 --> 00:12:09.896
estimate we'll have about 17 --> 000
people this year, give or take.

00:12:09.896 --> 00:12:14.400
And we will give out roughly 15
of black/‹ber badges just DT,

00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:17.103
makes that determination, um,
and at closing ceremonies

00:12:17.103 --> 00:12:19.839
they'll be awarded. In order to
get one of these you have to

00:12:19.839 --> 00:12:22.742
compete in a contest and you
have to win and you have to win

00:12:22.742 --> 00:12:27.113
first place. And it has to be a
contest worthy of earning one of

00:12:27.113 --> 00:12:29.849
these badges. Now, what these
are, are free entrance to DEF

00:12:29.849 --> 00:12:32.885
CON for the rest of your life.
But what they really are is

00:12:32.885 --> 00:12:35.288
status symbol. I know several
employers that will hire

00:12:35.288 --> 00:12:38.057
somebody on the spot if they
have a black badge on their

00:12:38.057 --> 00:12:41.294
resume from, from DEF CON. So
the ‹ber badges are very special

00:12:41.294 --> 00:12:45.565
every year. And so I try and,
and, and -- really, um, go over

00:12:45.565 --> 00:12:49.235
the top with them. Um, some of
you may have seen the ones that

00:12:49.235 --> 00:12:54.641
I did with the -- mechanical
clock parts in them -- for DEF

00:12:54.641 --> 00:12:57.977
CON 21 which was an homage to
my, to my grandfather. So um, I

00:12:57.977 --> 00:12:59.879
was talking about the waste (sp)
thing and I was wearing this

00:12:59.879 --> 00:13:02.448
shirt, now that I'm
transitioning to talk about the

00:13:02.448 --> 00:13:18.031
‹ber badges I actually need to
have a change of wardrobe here.

00:13:18.031 --> 00:13:26.339
So if you can bear with me. [
Cheering ] [ Laughter ] How many

00:13:26.339 --> 00:13:29.876
of you know what that is? [
Applause ] [ Clapping ] (

00:13:29.876 --> 00:13:34.280
Screaming ). Wow. Room full of
really smart people and only a

00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:41.287
few claps for Simon ( phonetic
). That's painful. There's no

00:13:41.287 --> 00:13:45.491
back. [ Laughter ] So I've been
really, ah, in, into Richard

00:13:45.491 --> 00:13:48.861
Feynman this year. Um, I had
before, but, ah, really the

00:13:48.861 --> 00:13:52.799
hacker aspects of his life, um,
are, now have been realized he

00:13:52.799 --> 00:13:55.068
was a safecracker, um, inside of
top super facilities he used to

00:13:55.068 --> 00:13:59.072
break into other people's safes
and leave them notes or hide

00:13:59.072 --> 00:14:06.946
their files, that kind of -- >>
( Speaker off microphone ). >>

00:14:06.946 --> 00:14:10.783
Can you hear? Is this fucked up?
Oh, sorry. Mom. My mom actually

00:14:10.783 --> 00:14:16.889
told me to quick swearing in my
talks live in front of everybody

00:14:16.889 --> 00:14:20.626
at, at -- 101 yesterday. That
was fun. Okay. [ Laughter ] So

00:14:20.626 --> 00:14:23.996
we start out the base of the
‹ber badge this year is an

00:14:23.996 --> 00:14:28.935
acrylic that has been etched in
what is called a Lichtenberg

00:14:28.935 --> 00:14:32.605
figure. That's a guy named Burke
Hickman who runs a website, he's

00:14:32.605 --> 00:14:36.142
a retired physicist and really
awesome guy. I spent many hours

00:14:36.142 --> 00:14:41.047
on the phone with him talking
about these. So the, the organ

00:14:41.047 --> 00:14:43.950
of this type of etching dates
clear back to 1777, but these

00:14:43.950 --> 00:14:47.186
were run through a 5
million-volt particle

00:14:47.186 --> 00:14:50.056
accelerator because acrylic, you
know, is an insulator and it

00:14:50.056 --> 00:14:53.359
takes that to charge up the
acrylic. So then the acrylic is

00:14:53.359 --> 00:14:57.096
forcibly discharged. Usually
taking a metal object and

00:14:57.096 --> 00:15:00.299
spiking it to ground much again,
to the way the discharge happens

00:15:00.299 --> 00:15:02.468
on the cloud when a bolt of
lightning happens. So these are

00:15:02.468 --> 00:15:06.839
often referred to as lightning
sculptures. So what you have on

00:15:06.839 --> 00:15:09.809
the base of the ‹ber badge this
year literally is you are

00:15:09.809 --> 00:15:13.312
holding lightning in your hand
-- as close, or, approximation

00:15:13.312 --> 00:15:16.916
as I can get to. Um, the
potentials on these when they

00:15:16.916 --> 00:15:19.552
were charged up were as high as
2.5 million volts. Um, it is

00:15:19.552 --> 00:15:23.322
actually really dangerous. You
can see, ah, the discharge

00:15:23.322 --> 00:15:25.658
happening there. And the
research that came out of these

00:15:25.658 --> 00:15:29.629
actually is the basis for what
is now modern day plasma

00:15:29.629 --> 00:15:33.433
physics. So -- those are really
awesome. When I was talking to

00:15:33.433 --> 00:15:36.269
Burke, ah, he said -- it is
actually interesting that the

00:15:36.269 --> 00:15:40.940
U.S. air force holds the patent
on the fabrication process of

00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:45.611
these and it was because during
unmanned test spaceflights they

00:15:45.611 --> 00:15:48.614
were having instrumentation that
was coming back with dials that

00:15:48.614 --> 00:15:52.318
were being shattered and, and
ah, the similar patterns in

00:15:52.318 --> 00:15:55.421
them. And so they studied the,
the process after the fact, even

00:15:55.421 --> 00:15:58.691
though there was prior art, um,
back in 1777, but the entire

00:15:58.691 --> 00:16:01.761
process of how that happens
through these spaceflights was

00:16:01.761 --> 00:16:04.397
actually how they came to form
the patent of the actual

00:16:04.397 --> 00:16:08.401
fabrication process. So I
thought that was really

00:16:08.401 --> 00:16:11.437
interesting and, um, he told me
that back in, ah, the '70s there

00:16:11.437 --> 00:16:14.440
were people that were making
these and giving them away, like

00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:17.310
traveling salesmen we're using
them as giveaways and -- entice

00:16:17.310 --> 00:16:20.580
people to buy their Wares. But
now they kind of stopped,

00:16:20.580 --> 00:16:24.383
because obviously time on a
particle accelerator is not

00:16:24.383 --> 00:16:28.788
cheap, and you have to now get
permission from the U.S. air

00:16:28.788 --> 00:16:31.390
force to make them, I guess, if
you care about patents. Sorry,

00:16:31.390 --> 00:16:36.028
man. What? >> ( Speaker off
microphone ). >> So the next

00:16:36.028 --> 00:16:39.899
thing you will see on the ‹ber
badge on the bottom there is

00:16:39.899 --> 00:16:42.635
glass that has been doped with
uranium 238. It is 3% by weight,

00:16:42.635 --> 00:16:47.707
and it fluoresces like a mother
when you hit it with UV light. I

00:16:47.707 --> 00:16:52.445
also took all of the adhesives
that were used to attach this,

00:16:52.445 --> 00:16:57.683
have been, um, doped with a
phosphorus powder. So even the

00:16:57.683 --> 00:17:00.319
glue is -- glows when you charge
it up. In fact, ah, one night

00:17:00.319 --> 00:17:02.588
after I had been working on
building these, I build all of

00:17:02.588 --> 00:17:05.324
them by hand, because there
aren't that many ‹bers. I got

00:17:05.324 --> 00:17:07.760
into bed and I rolled over my
wife looked at me and she jumped

00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:09.929
back and she freaked out. And I
taught somebody was breaking in

00:17:09.929 --> 00:17:13.499
the house to murder us or
something. And she said, your

00:17:13.499 --> 00:17:16.769
hair is glowing. [ Laughter ]
And I -- and what had happened

00:17:16.769 --> 00:17:20.940
was I had gotten this phosphorus
powder on my hands when I was

00:17:20.940 --> 00:17:23.776
working on it, because I, um, do
my hand and I had -- rubbed it

00:17:23.776 --> 00:17:31.050
through my hair 'cause I was
sweating and the sweat had

00:17:31.050 --> 00:17:34.387
pulled the -- powder off my
hands and had gotten all through

00:17:34.387 --> 00:17:36.022
my hair, and apparently she said
it was absolutely terrifying. [

00:17:36.022 --> 00:17:37.657
Laughter ] In addition to that,
how many of you know what

00:17:37.657 --> 00:17:39.558
tritium is? A lot of you. How
many of you have -- ah -- it's

00:17:39.558 --> 00:17:41.761
in exit signs. It is in gun
sights and stuff like that. But

00:17:41.761 --> 00:17:44.530
the interesting thing is the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission

00:17:44.530 --> 00:17:46.866
controls the sale of this. It
determines who's allowed to

00:17:46.866 --> 00:17:50.536
purchase it, who's allowed to
have it. And I actually found

00:17:50.536 --> 00:17:53.673
out that when you buy like those
exit signs, you are actually

00:17:53.673 --> 00:17:57.043
getting a -- ah, I forget the
exact term, but it is like a

00:17:57.043 --> 00:18:00.446
temporary license to have that
volume of tritium and you have

00:18:00.446 --> 00:18:03.282
to actually theoretically
dispose of it in a very

00:18:03.282 --> 00:18:05.284
particular way, which never
happens. You know, the exit

00:18:05.284 --> 00:18:11.324
signs wind up in landfills all
the time. How many of you guys

00:18:11.324 --> 00:18:17.863
from the U.K.? So you guys in
U.K., you know, you can buy

00:18:17.863 --> 00:18:21.033
these as key chains in the U.K.
The U.K. is like we don't care.

00:18:21.033 --> 00:18:22.668
We don't give a fuck. You know,
you can have all of the tritium

00:18:22.668 --> 00:18:25.304
you want. So in order for get my
hands -- oh, well, a real quick

00:18:25.304 --> 00:18:28.140
comment. There's a guy who runs
a site called

00:18:28.140 --> 00:18:31.711
depletedcranium.com, and he was
trying to become an imported of

00:18:31.711 --> 00:18:35.047
tritium to make key chains to
make it a business. He wanted to

00:18:35.047 --> 00:18:38.250
sell them as key chains. Because
tritium glows for roughly 12 to

00:18:38.250 --> 00:18:41.554
20 years depending how much you
put it. Because usually you have

00:18:41.554 --> 00:18:45.925
a, it is usually glass vile, but
tritium is a gas. And it reacts

00:18:45.925 --> 00:18:47.526
with the coding that's on the
inside of that glass and it's

00:18:47.526 --> 00:18:49.795
what fluoresces. So it's like
permanent glow in the dark stuff

00:18:49.795 --> 00:18:52.331
that doesn't have to be charged
up. So he wanted to make key

00:18:52.331 --> 00:18:55.167
chains out of this, find your
keys in the dark, that kind of

00:18:55.167 --> 00:18:58.371
thing. And he has an entire blog
of his e-mail and letter

00:18:58.371 --> 00:19:01.674
correspondence back and forth
with the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory

00:19:01.674 --> 00:19:04.276
Commission. And it is absolutely
hilarious the discussion that

00:19:04.276 --> 00:19:09.048
they have because it's
ridiculous about, it's like what

00:19:09.048 --> 00:19:11.917
they consider frivolous versus,
ah, useful and he's like, well,

00:19:11.917 --> 00:19:14.587
finding your keys is useful. And
they're like no. It's a key

00:19:14.587 --> 00:19:18.024
chain. So it's frivolous. And so
they're going back and forth.

00:19:18.024 --> 00:19:20.526
But anyway, if you're interested
in that, go read about it, it's

00:19:20.526 --> 00:19:25.931
really funny. So we're going to
have a hypothetical story here

00:19:25.931 --> 00:19:29.935
because, um, I would never do
this. Um -- I, I heard about

00:19:29.935 --> 00:19:33.606
some guy that found a source of
tritium that would ship to the

00:19:33.606 --> 00:19:40.913
United States in sealed packets
of coffee. [ Laughter ] And so

00:19:40.913 --> 00:19:44.450
when things, when things would
come through, ah, customs they

00:19:44.450 --> 00:19:49.355
would be labeled as though, oh I
don't know, key chain.

00:19:49.355 --> 00:19:51.757
Ironically. [ Laughter ] Or
coffee. And you get these

00:19:51.757 --> 00:19:54.660
letter, and you're thinking,
hmm, I'm wondering if I have to

00:19:54.660 --> 00:19:58.097
tell Dark Tangent that I wasted
some of his money because I

00:19:58.097 --> 00:20:00.800
bought tritium vials off the
Internet from some guy and he

00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:03.402
sent me coffee. So -- [ Laughter
] You open up the packets.

00:20:03.402 --> 00:20:06.205
There's the tritium vials.
Anyway, so those in the states

00:20:06.205 --> 00:20:09.141
apparently the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission doesn't

00:20:09.141 --> 00:20:11.944
give a rip if you have like
small amounts because you have

00:20:11.944 --> 00:20:14.714
them in your gun sights and
everything else, some watches,

00:20:14.714 --> 00:20:17.783
they just like to determine who
does the fabrication,

00:20:17.783 --> 00:20:20.720
manufacturer, and want to have
it as a control substance,

00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:23.222
ultimately, I believe, because
they charge large fees for

00:20:23.222 --> 00:20:27.026
people that are getting those
licenses to do it, but anyway.

00:20:27.026 --> 00:20:33.732
Going on the badges are safe. So
what you're seeing there is on

00:20:33.732 --> 00:20:37.303
each ‹ber badge there are two
Swarovski crystal skulls, beads,

00:20:37.303 --> 00:20:40.005
and those tritium vials are
embedded in those. So those of

00:20:40.005 --> 00:20:42.942
you who win an ‹ber this year,
when you put this on your wall

00:20:42.942 --> 00:20:48.114
and you go to sleep at night,
the eyes of the skull will be

00:20:48.114 --> 00:20:50.683
staring into your soul for the
rest of your life. [ Laughter ]

00:20:50.683 --> 00:20:53.385
Um, for those of you, how many
of you know what a

00:20:53.385 --> 00:20:57.089
banana-equivalent dose is? [
Laughter ] So for those

00:20:57.089 --> 00:20:59.859
unfamiliar, because everyone,
everyone keeps going, are they

00:20:59.859 --> 00:21:02.661
safe, are these safe? Don't put
the badge near your nuts. You

00:21:02.661 --> 00:21:06.966
don't have kids again. [
Laughter ] You know. So ah,

00:21:06.966 --> 00:21:11.070
there is a unit of measure that
is kind of a joke amongst those

00:21:11.070 --> 00:21:14.073
that are really into nuclear
physics or just screwing around

00:21:14.073 --> 00:21:17.276
with radioactive stuff, um,
called a banana-equivalent dose.

00:21:17.276 --> 00:21:20.212
But due to the potassium in a
banana, if you eat a banana, you

00:21:20.212 --> 00:21:22.481
get a certain amount of
radiation. Ah, same thing with

00:21:22.481 --> 00:21:25.718
sleeping next to somebody,
walking outside, there's

00:21:25.718 --> 00:21:28.621
background radiation, and so
there are, there, there, I just

00:21:28.621 --> 00:21:32.024
found it hilarious that there is
this thing called the

00:21:32.024 --> 00:21:36.395
banana-equivalent dose, BED,
that I listed there. Also, um,

00:21:36.395 --> 00:21:39.165
Matt Blaze was in my room
looking at these and he had his

00:21:39.165 --> 00:21:41.967
Geiger counter, we were trying
to determine, you know, he

00:21:41.967 --> 00:21:46.172
wanted to see independently if
the stuff that I had done, you

00:21:46.172 --> 00:21:50.676
know, what the beta versus gamma
versus alpha was off of these.

00:21:50.676 --> 00:21:58.117
But anyway, can you guys still
hear me? Yes? Oh, we're dead

00:21:58.117 --> 00:22:01.053
fish. [ Laughter ] Hello? Yes? [
Cheers ] All right. So there's a

00:22:01.053 --> 00:22:06.725
picture of one of the uranium
vials. I think I have -- oh,

00:22:06.725 --> 00:22:10.296
yeah. I do have one in my pocket
still. [ Laughter ] So if anyone

00:22:10.296 --> 00:22:12.765
wants to come look at this, this
one -- this one is actually a

00:22:12.765 --> 00:22:16.836
mix of different ores. So the
reason I show you the dram is in

00:22:16.836 --> 00:22:19.738
addition to the tritium vile
that's on there, as well has

00:22:19.738 --> 00:22:23.609
uranium built glass marble
underneath one of them, there

00:22:23.609 --> 00:22:27.379
are, there is a mixture of fish
glen, yellow cake, and uranium

00:22:27.379 --> 00:22:30.549
ore. And if you turn the badge
over, because of the

00:22:30.549 --> 00:22:34.053
Licktensphere is unclear,
clearly, you can see them

00:22:34.053 --> 00:22:36.388
through the back of the badge,
but it's kind of like a made a

00:22:36.388 --> 00:22:39.024
little viewing window. The skull
holds the radioactive material

00:22:39.024 --> 00:22:43.963
in because, you know what better
object to hold radioactive

00:22:43.963 --> 00:22:47.199
material then a skull. Um -- so
ah, and that just shows -- so

00:22:47.199 --> 00:22:49.602
where I counter sunk holes into
the acrylic, put the samples in,

00:22:49.602 --> 00:22:55.040
this is where I had already
mounted the marbles, but I

00:22:55.040 --> 00:22:59.878
hadn't put the ores in yet. So,
who knows what happened on July

00:22:59.878 --> 00:23:06.952
16th, 1945? Not very many of
you. Right? So the reason I went

00:23:06.952 --> 00:23:10.055
through all of this trouble is
I'm an avid collector of things,

00:23:10.055 --> 00:23:15.294
I like to feel connected to
heroes of mine. Ah, whether it

00:23:15.294 --> 00:23:18.063
be in research, mathematics,
linguistics, whatever. And so

00:23:18.063 --> 00:23:22.234
Feynman has been kind of my
obsession. And I was trying to

00:23:22.234 --> 00:23:27.506
think, you know, Feynman is now
no longer living so what is the

00:23:27.506 --> 00:23:30.976
closest I could be to seeing one
of his experiments. So Feynman

00:23:30.976 --> 00:23:34.914
and open timer were present on
July 16th, 1945, when it device

00:23:34.914 --> 00:23:39.451
which is known as Gadget was the
first nuclear detonation. And

00:23:39.451 --> 00:23:42.888
that happened in New Mexico. And
when you do that, when you do a

00:23:42.888 --> 00:23:49.928
nuclear test like that you form
this substance called trinitite.

00:23:49.928 --> 00:23:53.966
Sorry. Water is on this floor.
So I have also procured

00:23:53.966 --> 00:23:58.337
trinitite from the actual test
site that Oppenheimer and

00:23:58.337 --> 00:24:04.643
Feynman were at. And it is also
embedded on the badge underneath

00:24:04.643 --> 00:24:06.779
the skull on the other side. So
-- well, not theoretically,

00:24:06.779 --> 00:24:08.914
literally, you are holding in
your hands one step removed a

00:24:08.914 --> 00:24:11.083
piece of an experiment that was
conducted by Feynman when you

00:24:11.083 --> 00:24:13.919
get one of these badges. That
means a lot to me because I'm

00:24:13.919 --> 00:24:17.956
all about giving credit to the
shoulders of giants that I try

00:24:17.956 --> 00:24:22.027
to stand on. And so this is kind
of my homage, yet, again, to, to

00:24:22.027 --> 00:24:24.196
-- hero of mine. So the
trinitite, um, has actually been

00:24:24.196 --> 00:24:28.033
analyzed by a couple of
different independent labs.

00:24:28.033 --> 00:24:31.270
There's also a guy on-line, he,
named Hunter Scott, who took

00:24:31.270 --> 00:24:35.441
some to Georgia Tech and in
their lab they were able not

00:24:35.441 --> 00:24:38.110
only to actually verify the
signature, but the distance from

00:24:38.110 --> 00:24:41.380
the epicenter of the blast based
on the signature, um, which from

00:24:41.380 --> 00:24:45.651
these samples, I'm not releasing
what it is, it's kind of like my

00:24:45.651 --> 00:24:48.320
crypto key, because even if
somebody managed to detonate a

00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:51.056
nuclear bomb, collect the
samples, place them on a piece

00:24:51.056 --> 00:24:54.293
of trinitite, or, or -- a peer
of acrylic which has been

00:24:54.293 --> 00:24:57.296
charged through a particle
accelerator, forcibly

00:24:57.296 --> 00:25:00.466
discharged, held lightning, and
go through all of that trouble

00:25:00.466 --> 00:25:03.469
and order coffee from Singapore
and get -- ah, tritium vials,

00:25:03.469 --> 00:25:08.173
mount them on there, it's still
not going to have the same

00:25:08.173 --> 00:25:16.115
nuclear signature as this badge.
So -- [ Laughter ] Thank you. [

00:25:16.115 --> 00:25:23.355
Applause ] So it is like an ‹ber
RSA token, although it takes a

00:25:23.355 --> 00:25:26.892
while to verify. [ Laughter ] So
there is a final picture of the

00:25:26.892 --> 00:25:32.464
badge. Ah, there's Feynman there
and Feynman here. So I wanted --

00:25:32.464 --> 00:25:35.567
ah, I didn't want to get up here
and rant and I apologize if it

00:25:35.567 --> 00:25:39.438
felt that way. I want you guys
to have a great DEF CON. Um, I

00:25:39.438 --> 00:25:42.975
want you to talk to each other.
I told the guys in 101, if you

00:25:42.975 --> 00:25:45.811
don't feel like someone here
isn't approachable, then I think

00:25:45.811 --> 00:25:52.151
they're a dick and I don't want
them here anyway. I think

00:25:52.151 --> 00:25:56.555
there's -- yeah. Thank you,
please clap for that. Don't be a

00:25:56.555 --> 00:25:59.124
dick. [ Applause ] We really
don't want those people in the

00:25:59.124 --> 00:26:01.427
community. There's a number of
people that have been getting a

00:26:01.427 --> 00:26:03.896
lot of press lately. Don't let
it go to your head. They're

00:26:03.896 --> 00:26:06.265
approachable. They started just
like everybody else did. And

00:26:06.265 --> 00:26:09.134
really with what's going on, on
the outside, people trying to

00:26:09.134 --> 00:26:11.937
legislate research and force --
back dooring and weakening of

00:26:11.937 --> 00:26:14.706
standards, that's something that
needs to be taken head on and

00:26:14.706 --> 00:26:18.210
we're only going to be able to
do that as if we're a unified

00:26:18.210 --> 00:26:21.013
community. I love the fact that
I can come here to DEF CON and I

00:26:21.013 --> 00:26:24.416
can wear dorky T-shirts and I
don't have to explain them to

00:26:24.416 --> 00:26:27.286
people, I was talking to Mickey
earlier and I forget, oh, I made

00:26:27.286 --> 00:26:30.022
a joke, I said, ah,
occasionally, ah, hey, looking

00:26:30.022 --> 00:26:40.299
there. [ Laughter ] Everybody
turn and wave. [ Laughter ]

00:26:40.299 --> 00:26:43.368
That's Jeff Moss, everybody.
Dark Tangent. [ Applause ] So

00:26:43.368 --> 00:26:48.540
you are all here today because
of Jeff. And so I think Jeff's

00:26:48.540 --> 00:26:51.410
going to come up and say a few
words to you, but the point I

00:26:51.410 --> 00:26:53.378
was making is that the joke was
-- ah, as far as the opening

00:26:53.378 --> 00:26:56.181
ceremonies, Jeff is an interrupt
routine. So Jeff comes up and

00:26:56.181 --> 00:27:00.018
then my cycle stops, and he
talks. [ Laughter ] But Jeff is,

00:27:00.018 --> 00:27:02.688
ah, the reason that I'm here
this conference has affected my

00:27:02.688 --> 00:27:05.657
life in more ways than one, and
I'm grateful for him. So those

00:27:05.657 --> 00:27:08.660
of you this is your first time,
make a lot out of the

00:27:08.660 --> 00:27:17.769
conference. But I'd like
everyone please give a hand to

00:27:17.769 --> 00:27:22.174
Jeff. [ Applause ] ( Speaker off
microphone ). >> Okay. >> (

00:27:22.174 --> 00:27:24.443
Speaker off microphone ). >> So,
so they're all -- they're

00:27:24.443 --> 00:27:28.647
covered in radioactive dust now?
You told them about that? And

00:27:28.647 --> 00:27:32.484
then how they have to --
decontaminate on -- okay. Good.

00:27:32.484 --> 00:27:35.921
[ Laughter ] All right. Well,
thank you for coming to the con.

00:27:35.921 --> 00:27:40.559
Just -- have you done a show by
hands how many are new here? >>

00:27:40.559 --> 00:27:42.261
Do it again. >> Do it again. Oh,
my gosh. That's great. So can I

00:27:42.261 --> 00:27:46.932
see just, I'm curious how many
people are not from the United

00:27:46.932 --> 00:27:50.869
States? Holy crap -- and not
Canada. [ Laughter ] And not --

00:27:50.869 --> 00:27:54.273
[ Laughter ] Okay. Now, it makes
more sense. [ Laughter ] I knew

00:27:54.273 --> 00:27:57.609
I was forgetting a key part of
that question. [ Laughter ]

00:27:57.609 --> 00:28:01.780
Awesome. Okay. So that's great
because what we try to do every

00:28:01.780 --> 00:28:04.983
year is -- it would be stagnant
and the conference would end up

00:28:04.983 --> 00:28:08.420
dying if we can't bring in fresh
blood. And -- [ Laughter ] If

00:28:08.420 --> 00:28:10.722
you think about our hacking
commute, at least the way it's

00:28:10.722 --> 00:28:14.159
started for me, probably for
you, it was really sort of an

00:28:14.159 --> 00:28:18.764
apprenticeship-style program in
the early days for me because

00:28:18.764 --> 00:28:21.066
there was no Amazon, there was
no web, there was no security

00:28:21.066 --> 00:28:25.070
books written anywhere --
there's no Google. So it was

00:28:25.070 --> 00:28:28.073
really about how do you get into
hacking? How do you even know

00:28:28.073 --> 00:28:32.477
hacking exists? And for me it
was the movie "War Games." [

00:28:32.477 --> 00:28:36.682
Laughter ] That got me
interested. [ Laughter ] [

00:28:36.682 --> 00:28:39.184
Applause ] That was a good one.
And so, you know, I didn't know

00:28:39.184 --> 00:28:42.287
all the problems with the movie,
I just thought it was really

00:28:42.287 --> 00:28:46.325
cool movie. And later on in life
I, it is funny I ended up

00:28:46.325 --> 00:28:49.328
meeting this other hacker, um,
one of, the next ones I networks

00:28:49.328 --> 00:28:52.464
met him at DEF CON 1, it was
interesting because the speaker

00:28:52.464 --> 00:28:55.467
was speaking on-stage of DEF CON
1 and like right over there, you

00:28:55.467 --> 00:28:57.869
know, we only had 100 people at
the first DEF CON. And he's

00:28:57.869 --> 00:28:59.905
sitting over there and he's
making little phone call on a

00:28:59.905 --> 00:29:02.708
cell phone and that, right off
the bat, not many people the

00:29:02.708 --> 00:29:05.911
cell phones. And, ah, so I end
up talking to him. And I'm like

00:29:05.911 --> 00:29:09.448
-- he's talking to me, and he's
being really open and, it -- he

00:29:09.448 --> 00:29:12.818
said, well, you know, that last
speaker that was speaking, yeah.

00:29:12.818 --> 00:29:15.387
I'm in his e-mail system, so
I've been reading what he's been

00:29:15.387 --> 00:29:18.023
doing and, I don't know if --
what he was telling you is

00:29:18.023 --> 00:29:20.492
really what he's doing. It's
like, really. It's like, yeah,

00:29:20.492 --> 00:29:23.328
but I might have to get into
this other guy's e-mail system

00:29:23.328 --> 00:29:27.866
and verify that. [ Laughter ]
And so -- it was just like all

00:29:27.866 --> 00:29:30.202
the hackers were in everybody
else's e-mail systems. Um, and

00:29:30.202 --> 00:29:33.772
they were, anybody that was
working on anything interesting,

00:29:33.772 --> 00:29:38.777
they would just shoulder surf
and get over your shoulder. And

00:29:38.777 --> 00:29:42.881
so he ran a system in Seattle
where he was from, which is

00:29:42.881 --> 00:29:45.350
where I was from, it was strange
-- he would have a bulletin

00:29:45.350 --> 00:29:49.655
board system with a big screen
that said -- if you find my

00:29:49.655 --> 00:29:52.824
system let me know because I
don't advertise this system. And

00:29:52.824 --> 00:29:55.894
the whole point was it was like
the honey net. He was trying to

00:29:55.894 --> 00:29:58.830
find other hackers. So like in
"War Games" he just had a system

00:29:58.830 --> 00:30:02.601
so if you dialed the city and
you found his system he wanted

00:30:02.601 --> 00:30:05.637
to meet you. And that was his
way of meeting new people. And

00:30:05.637 --> 00:30:08.440
so he told me when "War Games"
came out, he was so pissed out,

00:30:08.440 --> 00:30:13.011
because he was like, damn it,
now my secrets are out, now

00:30:13.011 --> 00:30:18.784
people are going to lock down
all of these modems and

00:30:18.784 --> 00:30:22.988
everything's going to be secure.
[ Laughter ] Like, oh, I wish it

00:30:22.988 --> 00:30:28.060
was that simple to fix things.
You know? Just release a movie.

00:30:28.060 --> 00:30:30.629
Um, so my point is -- that it's,
became an apprenticeship

00:30:30.629 --> 00:30:33.799
program, I had to meet the right
people. They had to meet the

00:30:33.799 --> 00:30:37.269
right people. And then we had to
learn from each other and be

00:30:37.269 --> 00:30:39.604
introduced to others. And so it
was through this sort of web of

00:30:39.604 --> 00:30:42.774
trust where you would meet other
people. That guy is a UNIX guy.

00:30:42.774 --> 00:30:45.844
That is a SS7 guy. Oh, you need
to talk to that guy, he knows

00:30:45.844 --> 00:30:51.183
what he is doing when it comes
to UNECOS or something. So

00:30:51.183 --> 00:30:53.285
nowadays we've lost that. Right?
We don't have really an

00:30:53.285 --> 00:30:57.622
apprenticeship program. That's,
I'm curious, how many people

00:30:57.622 --> 00:31:00.058
here learned about hacking from
a friend? How many people

00:31:00.058 --> 00:31:04.296
learned about hacking because
you just started Googling it and

00:31:04.296 --> 00:31:07.432
YouTubing it? Oh, they're about
the same. That's pretty

00:31:07.432 --> 00:31:12.771
surprising. So what I try to do
at the conference is encourage

00:31:12.771 --> 00:31:16.608
people to meet others and to
teach others because really

00:31:16.608 --> 00:31:19.811
what's the difference between
that and just sitting on-line

00:31:19.811 --> 00:31:22.280
and reading books? So that's why
I'm excited that a lot of you

00:31:22.280 --> 00:31:25.384
are first time people because I
think you're going to get a lot

00:31:25.384 --> 00:31:27.352
out of it and we keep saying
this -- you know, the conference

00:31:27.352 --> 00:31:31.490
is what you make of it. But
that's no bullshit, that is

00:31:31.490 --> 00:31:34.693
actually really true. So anyway,
something I want to leave you

00:31:34.693 --> 00:31:37.462
with is just think about the
next generation. Think about who

00:31:37.462 --> 00:31:40.766
you're going to sort of teach or
who you want to be taught by.

00:31:40.766 --> 00:31:44.236
And it's not binary, right? You
can be doing two things at the

00:31:44.236 --> 00:31:47.205
same time. And you're actually
probably going to get more out

00:31:47.205 --> 00:31:49.574
of it teaching someone. They're
going to ask a question and

00:31:49.574 --> 00:31:51.309
you're not going to know the
answer to it and you're going to

00:31:51.309 --> 00:31:53.278
have to go research it. The
other cool thing is you can do

00:31:53.278 --> 00:31:55.814
projects and more cool things.
And if you look at how hacking

00:31:55.814 --> 00:31:59.718
has evolved, it is really sort
of turning into a team sport.

00:31:59.718 --> 00:32:02.187
You know, the lone contributor
is -- can still make big

00:32:02.187 --> 00:32:05.924
strides, but if you're thinking
about how the companies work

00:32:05.924 --> 00:32:08.727
today, militaries work, defense
teams work, how does any of this

00:32:08.727 --> 00:32:11.630
stuff work, it's in teams. >> (
Speaker off microphone ). >>

00:32:11.630 --> 00:32:14.466
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Even our
puzzle challenges are

00:32:14.466 --> 00:32:17.536
team-based. So how many of you
know there are codes on your

00:32:17.536 --> 00:32:19.871
lanyards. Those who are first
times here. So I do that every

00:32:19.871 --> 00:32:23.141
year to force you to talk to
each other. Because no single

00:32:23.141 --> 00:32:25.410
person can go just do the, the,
crypto challenge because you

00:32:25.410 --> 00:32:28.346
have to talk to other people,
collect other pieces of

00:32:28.346 --> 00:32:32.050
information. Just like out on
the web. The corpus of knowledge

00:32:32.050 --> 00:32:35.053
out there to become the ultimate
lead hacker is tougher and

00:32:35.053 --> 00:32:37.322
tougher as the, the knowledge
space grows it becomes harder

00:32:37.322 --> 00:32:40.792
and harder to become an expert
in all fields. So you really

00:32:40.792 --> 00:32:44.496
have to have a diversity of
people on your team as far as

00:32:44.496 --> 00:32:46.965
skill sets are concerned. So
like, like DT was saying, what

00:32:46.965 --> 00:32:48.867
we really try and do is
encourage you to meet and talk

00:32:48.867 --> 00:32:52.103
to each other and not to be, and
function -- not function in

00:32:52.103 --> 00:32:55.207
isolation. Even here at the
conference, I've been to many

00:32:55.207 --> 00:32:57.976
security conferences where I've
seen people that spend the

00:32:57.976 --> 00:33:00.679
entire time either they're in a
talk list, or they're in the

00:33:00.679 --> 00:33:03.515
hallway on their laptop. And
they aren't talking to anyone.

00:33:03.515 --> 00:33:07.085
They aren't interacting with
anyone. They aren't making these

00:33:07.085 --> 00:33:10.488
connections. These are your,
this is like your extended

00:33:10.488 --> 00:33:12.657
hacker family. This is the place
you can go and wear your T-shirt

00:33:12.657 --> 00:33:16.094
and not have to explain it to
somebody. Or if you do, they're

00:33:16.094 --> 00:33:18.697
interested in the explanation. I
mean, I can't tell you the

00:33:18.697 --> 00:33:21.967
number of times I've gone to the
checkout counter of the grocery

00:33:21.967 --> 00:33:24.669
store and the teller will either
fake laugh at my shirt because

00:33:24.669 --> 00:33:27.239
I'll have some kind of tech joke
on it and I know for a fact that

00:33:27.239 --> 00:33:30.475
they didn't understand what it
meant. Or they will look at me

00:33:30.475 --> 00:33:33.478
like I'm crazy and -- very
rarely they will actually ask

00:33:33.478 --> 00:33:39.050
what it means and I'll explain
it to them is, is, gently as I

00:33:39.050 --> 00:33:42.254
can, and -- they -- do the like,
HA. [ Laughter ] >> So see his

00:33:42.254 --> 00:33:46.958
shirts are like that bulletin
board from my friend. If you get

00:33:46.958 --> 00:33:51.363
his shirt, he wants to know you.
[ Laughter ] Your filtration

00:33:51.363 --> 00:33:55.233
device. So then, I'll just do a
couple of like administrative

00:33:55.233 --> 00:33:57.502
things, kind of around the show
for first time people. There's

00:33:57.502 --> 00:34:01.239
too much show going on for you
to see it all. And for me, that

00:34:01.239 --> 00:34:04.743
was about DEF CON 4 when I was
so pissed at first I was so

00:34:04.743 --> 00:34:08.480
angry that more crap was
happening at the conference that

00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:10.482
I couldn't -- see. Like --
things were happening, I would

00:34:10.482 --> 00:34:13.285
never know about it at the
conference. And it took me a

00:34:13.285 --> 00:34:16.021
while to be okay with that. [
Laughter ] Because you want to

00:34:16.021 --> 00:34:19.024
experience everything. I wanted
to see everything that was

00:34:19.024 --> 00:34:21.092
happening. And then over the
years I realized, you know what

00:34:21.092 --> 00:34:25.330
we're doing with this show is
we're providing, it's almost

00:34:25.330 --> 00:34:29.200
like we're, you know,
conferences of platform. Or, or

00:34:29.200 --> 00:34:32.003
crap, or something. [ Laughter ]
And, ah -- [ Laughter ] What

00:34:32.003 --> 00:34:35.507
we're trying to do is we provide
platform for people. Oh, you

00:34:35.507 --> 00:34:39.044
want to do wall of sheep? And we
think you can pull it off? Guess

00:34:39.044 --> 00:34:41.746
what? I'll give you enough rope
to hang yourself. You do that.

00:34:41.746 --> 00:34:45.083
And if everybody says it sucks,
well you're not coming back. But

00:34:45.083 --> 00:34:48.887
if everybody likes it you get
more rope the next year. And so

00:34:48.887 --> 00:34:51.523
we have this constant renewal of
contests and events and that's

00:34:51.523 --> 00:34:54.092
why you'll see some event and
contests that are super polished

00:34:54.092 --> 00:34:56.561
and fantastic and other ones
that are really rough and

00:34:56.561 --> 00:35:00.365
ragged. >> You know the quote
will come out now that DT is

00:35:00.365 --> 00:35:04.436
advocating bondage at DEF CON. [
Laughter ] >> I advocate bandage

00:35:04.436 --> 00:35:09.741
in general, it is probably. Get
us in less trouble. [ Laughter ]

00:35:09.741 --> 00:35:12.444
Um, and so then with all the
things that are going on, it's

00:35:12.444 --> 00:35:14.813
okay. You're not going to see
everything. You know, follow

00:35:14.813 --> 00:35:17.482
twitter, follow Facebook, follow
whatever. But that's half the

00:35:17.482 --> 00:35:20.051
fun because you find people that
have radically different

00:35:20.051 --> 00:35:22.354
experiences from the same
conference. And some people are

00:35:22.354 --> 00:35:24.489
night people. And Vegas is
perfect for you. It's open 24/7.

00:35:24.489 --> 00:35:29.160
There's parties. Music. Movies,
whatever. We do a lot of things

00:35:29.160 --> 00:35:34.232
really late in the night. 2:00,
3:00 in the morning. Um, we do

00:35:34.232 --> 00:35:38.370
things sometimes pretty early in
the morning. And so -- unless

00:35:38.370 --> 00:35:41.272
you're assisted by chemical
support, ah, unit, you probably

00:35:41.272 --> 00:35:46.077
not going to be up for it all.
And that's cool. Just want to

00:35:46.077 --> 00:35:50.248
let you know that we're -- we're
-- available. Ah, to help give

00:35:50.248 --> 00:35:53.318
you direction. And we're also
available to like let you find

00:35:53.318 --> 00:35:56.121
your own way. And so, that's
kind of the -- >> ( Speaker off

00:35:56.121 --> 00:35:58.957
microphone ). >> The videos. >>
( Speaker off microphone ). >>

00:35:58.957 --> 00:36:01.526
Oh, yeah. Yeah. In case you
don't know, I mean, you see this

00:36:01.526 --> 00:36:04.896
going on, on the right, this is,
um, for people that might be

00:36:04.896 --> 00:36:08.733
vision-impaired, but really what
it came out of also was --

00:36:08.733 --> 00:36:13.705
vision-impaired -- [ Laughter ]
Yeah. [ Laughter ] >> ( Speaker

00:36:13.705 --> 00:36:18.109
off microphone ). >> Drink. >>
Vision-impaired question mark.

00:36:18.109 --> 00:36:21.546
>> All I got is water. I'm
sorry. Um, and so it turns out,

00:36:21.546 --> 00:36:24.616
though, that for the State of
California, um, a couple years

00:36:24.616 --> 00:36:27.452
ago they, they had a law that,
ah, said you can't have any

00:36:27.452 --> 00:36:31.022
teaching materials in a
classroom that doesn't have --

00:36:31.022 --> 00:36:34.726
ah, second audio program, or
doesn't have the, um, ah, what,

00:36:34.726 --> 00:36:38.663
what do you call it? >>
Captioning. >> Captioning. Yes.

00:36:38.663 --> 00:36:46.705
So I wanted to have all of DEF
CON in California school system,

00:36:46.705 --> 00:36:52.777
if possible, and so I had to
start paying for captioning. So

00:36:52.777 --> 00:36:55.413
we went out and we found a
captioning company. [ Applause ]

00:36:55.413 --> 00:36:58.750
So, so because of this, it turns
out not only then do we get in

00:36:58.750 --> 00:37:01.052
California, we're, it's, it's
possible for any school to use

00:37:01.052 --> 00:37:04.289
the system now and be compliant
with their state laws, but also,

00:37:04.289 --> 00:37:06.524
it means when you watch this
stuff on YouTube once we finally

00:37:06.524 --> 00:37:11.262
upload it, and you look at the
translation it doesn't look like

00:37:11.262 --> 00:37:14.399
-- GLUP, banana, computer, car,
you know, it actually makes

00:37:14.399 --> 00:37:17.268
sense. Because the
autotranslates from YouTube

00:37:17.268 --> 00:37:21.005
doesn't work well with all of
our technical lingo. And the

00:37:21.005 --> 00:37:23.575
other things we do, is
everything, of course, is, is

00:37:23.575 --> 00:37:29.747
available for free, we give it
all away -- sort of -- back to

00:37:29.747 --> 00:37:33.184
had -- community. [ Applause ]
-- you know -- [ Applause ] And

00:37:33.184 --> 00:37:35.820
when I started doing that at the
first DEF CON, um, well, I

00:37:35.820 --> 00:37:38.123
couldn't just -- first DEF CON
we made audiotapes and we sold

00:37:38.123 --> 00:37:40.725
them, but as the Internet came
along we put everything on-line

00:37:40.725 --> 00:37:43.228
and gave it away and partially
that was sort of a forcing

00:37:43.228 --> 00:37:48.066
function. I wanted to force
other conventions to do that. I

00:37:48.066 --> 00:37:52.036
wanted to force the information
to be free. And almost every

00:37:52.036 --> 00:37:59.277
conference does this. And I
think that's a great -- [

00:37:59.277 --> 00:38:01.813
Applause ] Great, great thing. [
Applause ] So you can always

00:38:01.813 --> 00:38:04.582
come back and watch the videos.
You can always come back and

00:38:04.582 --> 00:38:07.452
read what's going on. So if you
see something you want to do in

00:38:07.452 --> 00:38:10.221
person, you're having a great
hallway conversation with

00:38:10.221 --> 00:38:12.991
someone and you're learning a
lot, you know, don't worry about

00:38:12.991 --> 00:38:15.827
the talks. You can get the
talks. You can't get to those

00:38:15.827 --> 00:38:18.496
great conversations and build
those relationships later.

00:38:18.496 --> 00:38:20.732
That's harder. So just -- think
it through, like what you're

00:38:20.732 --> 00:38:23.735
priorities are. And there's a
joke that there's, you know, two

00:38:23.735 --> 00:38:27.438
conferences, there's the hallway
con and there's the speaking

00:38:27.438 --> 00:38:33.645
con. And that's true. So just
kind of think what you want to

00:38:33.645 --> 00:38:46.124
get out of, out of the
conference. You know, what, what

00:38:46.124 --> 00:38:47.892
are your thoughts on that. >>
Yeah. Um, so to, to, to go

00:38:47.892 --> 00:38:49.227
further, and thank you, Jeff,
for everybody -- [ Applause ]

00:38:49.227 --> 00:38:50.829
Again -- for the conference. [
Applause ] So -- so -- I can, I

00:38:50.829 --> 00:38:52.497
can say I wouldn't be here and I
wouldn't be where I am

00:38:52.497 --> 00:38:54.032
professionally, because, if it
wasn't for Jeff and DEF CON,

00:38:54.032 --> 00:38:56.067
because Jeff affected my
professional career. Um, but

00:38:56.067 --> 00:38:57.802
like Jeff was saying, ah, like
-- we have things like the 1057

00:38:57.802 --> 00:38:59.871
room. There were guys in there
last night until 5:00 to 6:00

00:38:59.871 --> 00:39:03.174
this morning. That's open 24
hours. There's probably still

00:39:03.174 --> 00:39:06.211
guys there now, right? So --
what I mean, there's guys there

00:39:06.211 --> 00:39:08.146
still from last night. So -- um,
I would encourage you, like,

00:39:08.146 --> 00:39:10.882
take a piece of one of the
puzzle challenges and find

00:39:10.882 --> 00:39:13.518
someone else to work on it with
you. I mean, even just if you're

00:39:13.518 --> 00:39:15.853
in line waiting for something,
flip open the program, see if

00:39:15.853 --> 00:39:19.123
you can crack some of the simple
ciphers. It really is designed

00:39:19.123 --> 00:39:22.126
to get you to start interacting
with other people. Or just get

00:39:22.126 --> 00:39:24.729
up and introduce yourself to
someone else. Find someone

00:39:24.729 --> 00:39:27.799
that's got something
interesting. Go to the speakers,

00:39:27.799 --> 00:39:32.237
like I was saying earlier, the
speakers are approachable. Go up

00:39:32.237 --> 00:39:36.341
and talk to them. Afterwards a
lot of them do QA and then they

00:39:36.341 --> 00:39:37.542
go out and the hallway and they
talk to people. Take advantage

00:39:37.542 --> 00:39:39.310
of that. I mean, this is one of
the rare opportunities that you

00:39:39.310 --> 00:39:41.546
have to go up and directly speak
to these people. And that's,

00:39:41.546 --> 00:39:44.449
that's what I did. In fact, to,
to put the point on the end of

00:39:44.449 --> 00:39:47.218
the comment Jeff was making --
that's how I'm here. I came here

00:39:47.218 --> 00:39:51.089
to my first DEF CON and competed
in a contest and then after that

00:39:51.089 --> 00:39:53.925
I started getting involved. I
went to Jeff and I said, hey, I

00:39:53.925 --> 00:39:56.494
want to do this thing. And he
said, go ahead. It -- and, and

00:39:56.494 --> 00:40:00.531
-- and then -- now, look -- now
look what's happened. So and,

00:40:00.531 --> 00:40:03.434
and, and Jeff is, is -- is --
wonderful in the fact that he

00:40:03.434 --> 00:40:06.638
will give people the opportunity
to try, he'll give you the

00:40:06.638 --> 00:40:10.041
opportunity to try, but it's up
to you to make what you will of

00:40:10.041 --> 00:40:13.077
it. So we'd like to thank you
all for coming out. We welcome

00:40:13.077 --> 00:40:19.050
you to the DEF CON and, I know,
Jeff, do you want to say the

00:40:19.050 --> 00:40:20.652
official DEF CON is -- >> Yeah.
DEF CON is now open! [ Applause

00:40:20.652 --> 00:00:00.000
] Yeah. Thank you. See you
around. [ Applause ] Thank you.
