00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:05.606
Good afternoon. My real name is
whatever that says. Thank you

00:00:05.606 --> 00:00:12.846
for coming. It is awesome to be
here. Everyone who is affiliated

00:00:12.846 --> 00:00:18.218
with DEF CON this is phenomenal.
The goons and this is

00:00:18.218 --> 00:00:24.224
overwhelming and once you get
the letter that says you have

00:00:26.393 --> 00:00:29.563
been accepted, you think, oh, my
God, I have been accepted. Thank

00:00:29.563 --> 00:00:35.569
you for you guys that are coming
and standing in the room. I'm

00:00:41.642 --> 00:00:47.648
going to keep going. [ LAUGHTER
] What I'm here to talk about

00:00:53.754 --> 00:00:59.760
today is the "Beyond the Scan:
The Value Proposition of

00:01:02.996 --> 00:01:09.002
Vulnerability Assessment." >>
Your talk has been cancelled. We

00:01:11.371 --> 00:01:17.377
have a tradition here at DEF
CON. Wait, I got that mixed up.

00:01:23.483 --> 00:01:29.489
All right. I do this all day.
DEF CON, our brand-new speaker!

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:38.765
>> DEF CON 23. Thank you very
much. [ APPLAUSE ] Water chaser.

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.111
So, a lot of us already do
vulnerability assessment and we

00:01:51.111 --> 00:01:53.880
are involved in scanning
activity and we already know how

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.684
that works and we are doing it
in our organization. There are a

00:01:57.684 --> 00:02:04.024
lot of aspects of performing and
scanning that are not

00:02:04.024 --> 00:02:10.530
understood. Maybe not by us, but
our organizations. I was the

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:16.670
client that knew they needed to
do this, but they were not

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.374
necessarily all together knowing
what they would do with that

00:02:20.374 --> 00:02:23.276
information once they got it.
And working with the clients and

00:02:23.276 --> 00:02:30.217
going through the narrative and
performing the scans and I

00:02:30.217 --> 00:02:36.123
realized there is an opportunity
for us, as performing this

00:02:36.123 --> 00:02:39.960
activity to really make more
meaningful changes in our OS and

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:42.662
you are going to hear me say
this a couple of times, where

00:02:42.662 --> 00:02:48.668
the later (Indiscernible)
happens and we were trying to

00:02:58.111 --> 00:03:03.417
impact the business. There is
contact info on the CD, as well.

00:03:03.417 --> 00:03:05.519
So, stay in touch. You do
vulnerability assessments and

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:08.722
say, I'm your tool guy and a lot
of people think that you set-up

00:03:08.722 --> 00:03:11.725
a scanner and click scan and
that's it. It is regarded as one

00:03:11.725 --> 00:03:14.261
of the least sexy things in info
sector. Vulnerability tends to

00:03:14.261 --> 00:03:17.030
get glossed over and in my
opinion, it is a key component

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:20.434
of the accessibility program and
if it gets overlooked, you are

00:03:20.434 --> 00:03:26.440
doing a disservice to your
organization. Hopefully, this is

00:04:28.935 --> 00:04:31.872
going to be useful to you when
you go back to your

00:04:31.872 --> 00:04:37.878
organizations that you are
supporting. We are going to talk

00:04:41.348 --> 00:04:47.354
about "beyond the scan" and
provide support. Whether you are

00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:54.294
a blue team or a red team, we
are doing the heavy lifting

00:04:54.294 --> 00:04:56.296
blue-collar security work.
That's what we are talking

00:04:56.296 --> 00:04:58.298
about. The next slide and we are
talking about the human tester

00:04:58.298 --> 00:05:00.233
and the tools-based scanning.
The data by itself is very, very

00:05:00.233 --> 00:05:02.235
useful and it tells you a lot
about your environment and what

00:05:02.235 --> 00:05:04.237
you are doing. Without the human
testers, you are just gathering

00:05:04.237 --> 00:05:06.239
data and making a bunch of
noise. I feel strongly when you

00:05:06.239 --> 00:05:08.241
apply the human testers, that's
all of us, to the data that you

00:05:08.241 --> 00:05:10.243
gather, that's when the magic
happens. Just to reiterate, this

00:05:10.243 --> 00:05:12.245
is not a tool-based talk, we are
using tools in a smarter way and

00:05:12.245 --> 00:05:14.247
having people know when to use
these tools. Does that make any

00:05:14.247 --> 00:05:16.249
sense? We need to go a scan and
we are going to give it to some

00:05:16.249 --> 00:05:18.251
new guy and let him scan the
network. I don't respond

00:05:18.251 --> 00:05:20.253
positively to that. Please,
don't do that. You need to have

00:05:20.253 --> 00:05:22.255
the talented humans and in
addition to having the humans

00:05:22.255 --> 00:05:24.257
and applying it to the data, a
question that comes up a lot and

00:05:24.257 --> 00:05:26.259
perhaps you have heard this
question, as well. What should

00:05:26.259 --> 00:05:28.261
we scan? I like the longitudinal
scans. Scan everything. Clicking

00:05:28.261 --> 00:05:30.263
and scanning is easy, but making
sense of the data is the hard

00:05:30.263 --> 00:05:32.265
part. When I get later on in the
case studies, you have to do

00:05:32.265 --> 00:05:34.267
longitudinal studies over time.
If there is an IP stack, you

00:05:34.267 --> 00:05:36.269
should scan it. Maybe, you are
scanning very specific things

00:05:36.269 --> 00:05:38.271
that you are interested in. To
understand your network

00:05:38.271 --> 00:05:40.273
environment, you need to see
everything that is on there and

00:05:40.273 --> 00:05:42.275
not just the known quantities
that you have. There are some

00:05:42.275 --> 00:05:44.277
interesting stories coming up
and talking about that. Humans

00:05:44.277 --> 00:05:46.279
that are looking at the data
also scan all of the things.

00:05:46.279 --> 00:05:48.281
Another point and obviously, we
can't avoid talking about

00:05:48.281 --> 00:05:50.283
(Indiscernible) because we are
using this data. I'm going to

00:05:50.283 --> 00:05:52.285
try and be as vendor specific as
possible. There are some names

00:05:52.285 --> 00:05:54.287
up. They are all very, very good
in their own way. In your future

00:05:54.287 --> 00:05:56.289
engagements, you may need to
pick one tool. There is one tool

00:05:56.289 --> 00:05:58.291
that I'm using currently that is
doing very fine. All will work,

00:05:58.291 --> 00:06:00.227
and you have to work with your
organization and decide which

00:06:00.227 --> 00:06:02.229
one is the best for you. I'm
going to make you sit through a

00:06:02.229 --> 00:06:04.231
history lesson. The security
administrator tool for analyzing

00:06:04.231 --> 00:06:06.233
networks or SATAN was released
in 1995. They were not

00:06:06.233 --> 00:06:08.235
interested in marketing,
obviously. Anyone around in

00:06:08.235 --> 00:06:10.237
1995? Thank goodness. That was a
big deal. I remember reading in

00:06:10.237 --> 00:06:12.239
the trade magazines and this is
the worst idea ever. Why would

00:06:12.239 --> 00:06:14.241
you make a tool to make it
easier to find vulnerabilities

00:06:14.241 --> 00:06:16.243
and the other half of the people
thought; thank God, now I have a

00:06:16.243 --> 00:06:18.245
way to find the vulnerabilities.
The conversation that we had a

00:06:18.245 --> 00:06:20.247
year ago and firewalls were an
expensive way to slow down your

00:06:20.247 --> 00:06:22.249
network and fire routers were
fine. We know that's not true.

00:06:22.249 --> 00:06:24.251
To give you a state-of-the-art
work back then, it was a long

00:06:24.251 --> 00:06:30.257
time ago and things were a lot
different back then. PC Magazine

00:06:57.150 --> 00:07:03.089
-- to show you know and for
today and when we do scans all

00:07:05.692 --> 00:07:11.698
of the time. There are millions
of people scanning the Internet.

00:07:26.479 --> 00:07:32.485
20 years ago, this would get you
landed in jail. Two decades ago

00:07:59.346 --> 00:08:05.285
and it is crazy to think this is
a dramatic thing. And one of the

00:08:28.575 --> 00:08:31.044
tools that came out after SATAN
can scan 100 known

00:08:31.044 --> 00:08:34.214
vulnerabilities. Think about
that. I have 100 in my pocket

00:08:34.214 --> 00:08:38.651
right now that many of you are
trying to find, by the way. The

00:08:38.651 --> 00:08:41.187
last time I checked, it was
160 --> 000 different

00:08:41.187 --> 00:08:44.357
vulnerabilities. 20, going from
100 known things on Linux and

00:08:44.357 --> 00:08:47.193
now, almost a couple hundred
thousand on many different

00:08:47.193 --> 00:08:50.363
platforms. You can learn about
these folks that created SATAN.

00:08:50.363 --> 00:08:54.167
They wisely choose saint. Now,
it is like a Dan Brown novel.

00:08:54.167 --> 00:08:57.670
Thank you, I wrote that myself.
It became a commercial product

00:08:57.670 --> 00:09:02.041
in 1998. SATAN came out in '95
and all hell broke loose. And if

00:09:02.041 --> 00:09:05.512
you remember from my slide,
there are a lot of commercial

00:09:05.512 --> 00:09:08.681
products that exist. From that
humble beginning and now, an

00:09:08.681 --> 00:09:11.851
entirely different capability
with the info sect. Now, we are

00:09:11.851 --> 00:09:14.087
doing vulnerability assessment
and looking across multiple

00:09:14.087 --> 00:09:17.557
platforms across a large number
of hosts and that leads to

00:09:17.557 --> 00:09:20.727
vulnerability management. I'm
going to pause for a moment; it

00:09:20.727 --> 00:09:23.596
is not just performing the scan.
Vulnerability management means

00:09:23.596 --> 00:09:27.067
that now, that we have the
information and know it, what

00:09:27.067 --> 00:09:31.204
are we going to do about it? You
mitigate, transfer it, but you

00:09:31.204 --> 00:09:35.308
have to do something. And now,
we know about it and how to

00:09:35.308 --> 00:09:39.446
document it in an audible way.
Now, we have this thing and we

00:09:39.446 --> 00:09:45.452
know it is working and how do we
know that the decision that we

00:09:56.296 --> 00:10:02.302
make today is going to be
ongoing in the future. The

00:10:32.799 --> 00:10:38.171
landscape could be very, very
tiny and that could change. Now,

00:10:38.171 --> 00:10:41.741
I care all of a sudden.
Vulnerability management

00:10:41.741 --> 00:10:46.613
includes all of those things.
So, a couple of decades ago,

00:10:46.613 --> 00:10:51.951
scanners came out and yesterday
yet, I still feel like in our

00:10:51.951 --> 00:10:55.955
industry, particularly when we
start touching the business, we

00:10:55.955 --> 00:11:00.760
are still misunderstood. I love
that cartoon. No one else likes

00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:05.198
it? We are still misunderstood
and working with several clients

00:11:05.198 --> 00:11:10.103
over the last several years and
one question that always comes

00:11:10.103 --> 00:11:15.408
up, all right, I have human
testing. And I have tool-based

00:11:15.408 --> 00:11:18.077
scanning. If I get this new
scanner, can I get

00:11:18.077 --> 00:11:24.083
(Indiscernible). That's a
conversation that I started to

00:11:38.298 --> 00:11:40.300
have. I started to talk about
the scanning activity relative

00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:42.302
to the OSI model and this is
going to show certain tools that

00:11:42.302 --> 00:11:44.304
we might use and how they work
relative to other tools. Are we

00:11:44.304 --> 00:11:46.306
all familiar with the OSI model?
Love it? Hate it? Down at the

00:11:46.306 --> 00:11:48.308
bottom we have electrons and
protons and going through fiber.

00:11:48.308 --> 00:11:50.310
If you are interested in TTP
ports and if we are interested

00:11:50.310 --> 00:11:52.745
in client applications that are
talking to a server somewhere.

00:11:52.745 --> 00:11:56.316
And now, we are higher up in the
model and the host layers and it

00:11:56.316 --> 00:11:58.952
is giving us visibility into
there. And maybe, we use web

00:11:58.952 --> 00:12:01.955
inspect or Burke or in the host
layers or in the network and

00:12:01.955 --> 00:12:04.824
wanting to sniff traffic and it
goes on. You can see already,

00:12:04.824 --> 00:12:07.894
when I drop the scanner in
there, it is giving us a wider

00:12:07.894 --> 00:12:10.763
view than the other tools. If
the question comes up, we bought

00:12:10.763 --> 00:12:13.600
this great, expensive scanner,
and what can we get rid of? It

00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:16.002
is not replacing something. It
gives us information that is

00:12:16.002 --> 00:12:18.605
useful and the only thing, which
is capable of scanning the

00:12:18.605 --> 00:12:21.441
entire stack, is the humans, us.
They are actually doing the work

00:12:21.441 --> 00:12:23.843
and whether it is manually
penetration testing on an app

00:12:23.843 --> 00:12:27.513
trying to break in or looking at
the tools that it is trying to

00:12:27.513 --> 00:12:33.519
gather, the people are the most
important. I have gotten a lot

00:12:39.192 --> 00:12:47.033
of really good feedback and I
would be interested to hear from

00:12:47.033 --> 00:12:53.172
you folks if this OSI slide is
useful. Starting to talk to the

00:12:53.172 --> 00:12:59.746
business, it helps them to see
that we have a lot to deal with

00:12:59.746 --> 00:13:04.417
and securing the applications
and the systems and there are

00:13:04.417 --> 00:13:09.589
lots of different ways to gather
that information. To kind of

00:13:09.589 --> 00:13:15.228
illustrate that in a different
way. We can see our tools are

00:13:15.228 --> 00:13:19.465
very, very useful for the
longitudinal scans and doing

00:13:19.465 --> 00:13:24.671
scans over a long period of
time. And comparing results and

00:13:24.671 --> 00:13:29.375
seeing what is our security
posture today and as that

00:13:29.375 --> 00:13:33.613
changes, it moves on. The
people, don't let anyone

00:13:33.613 --> 00:13:38.785
(Indiscernible) decide to start
use tools and ideas and going to

00:13:38.785 --> 00:13:44.457
replace other tools and it is
also not going to replace your

00:13:44.457 --> 00:13:50.096
people. You still have to have
people who know what that data

00:13:50.096 --> 00:13:56.235
is and you can read through a
list of things that are on

00:13:56.235 --> 00:13:59.706
there. There is a short list of
the things that we're good at

00:13:59.706 --> 00:14:05.645
that the tools are not. It is
limited without the security

00:14:08.581 --> 00:14:14.587
professionals. All right. This
is an interesting example of

00:14:16.823 --> 00:14:20.960
that. I told the story earlier
and it worked out. We did an

00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:24.664
assessment for a client and came
back with a lot of http

00:14:24.664 --> 00:14:27.133
vulnerabilities and Apache
things. We asked them to come

00:14:27.133 --> 00:14:30.169
back and update the Apache and
they came back and said,

00:14:30.169 --> 00:14:33.473
obviously, they are S servers. I
can see the banner and assure

00:14:33.473 --> 00:14:36.509
you there is a demon running.
Here is a false/positive and

00:14:36.509 --> 00:14:39.545
here is why. And when you are
sharing with operations and

00:14:39.545 --> 00:14:42.281
business units and other people.
I found a really interesting

00:14:42.281 --> 00:14:45.318
thing and when you use words,
the same word might mean

00:14:45.318 --> 00:14:47.787
something completely different
depending on who you are talking

00:14:47.787 --> 00:14:51.090
to. If I say interface it is
going to mean three different

00:14:51.090 --> 00:14:54.393
things and if you have this
experience, as well. And if you

00:14:54.393 --> 00:14:58.264
are talking to a programmer and
you think API and it is an API,

00:14:58.264 --> 00:15:01.234
that is allowing things and if
you talk to routing and

00:15:01.234 --> 00:15:04.237
switching guys, they are talking
about a web-based guitar that is

00:15:04.237 --> 00:15:07.273
attaching to a network. It is
important whom you are talking

00:15:07.273 --> 00:15:10.309
to and language can be a
confusing thing. You have to

00:15:10.309 --> 00:15:14.280
know what you are talking about.
You need to know your

00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:20.286
environment, as well. On a
client engagement and how to

00:15:32.565 --> 00:15:38.571
scan a very large network that
had a global presence. We had

00:15:59.325 --> 00:16:06.966
distributed scan engines that
were in various networks around

00:16:06.966 --> 00:16:12.972
the world. There is one in
Argentina. Intuitively and

00:16:32.525 --> 00:16:38.531
backhauled through Houston. If I
wanted to scan Argentina or

00:17:01.521 --> 00:17:04.023
Brazil, it went by way of
Houston first. Architecturally

00:17:04.023 --> 00:17:08.094
the smart decision to scan North
America to South America. If you

00:17:08.094 --> 00:17:10.696
have a sufficiently large
(Indiscernible) you really need

00:17:10.696 --> 00:17:12.698
to know how those packets are
getting to where they are

00:17:12.698 --> 00:17:15.134
getting to. Understand the
architecture of your network.

00:17:15.134 --> 00:17:18.170
Now, we know which language to
use and our environment and now,

00:17:18.170 --> 00:17:20.439
we need to know our
organization. Don't panic, I'm

00:17:20.439 --> 00:17:26.445
going to walk you through this
whole slide. I know there are a

00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:50.236
lot of boxes going on. There are
a lot of ways that the scanner

00:18:15.294 --> 00:18:20.733
allows us to slice and dice data
and we can look at specific

00:18:20.733 --> 00:18:24.804
vulnerabilities and hosts and
group them in many

00:18:24.804 --> 00:18:30.876
(Indiscernible) and get in the
actual day that we are giving to

00:18:30.876 --> 00:18:35.948
the organization, we have to
make very conscious decisions on

00:18:35.948 --> 00:18:42.188
how to organize the data and how
to ultimately fix the problems

00:18:42.188 --> 00:18:48.194
that we are going to identify.
You need to capitalize in your

00:18:59.205 --> 00:19:05.144
organization and focus solely on
what is wrong with your box.

00:19:16.856 --> 00:19:22.862
Let's get into the case study
part of it. Identifying the

00:19:34.607 --> 00:19:40.613
potential vulnerabilities. What
we are trying to figure out here

00:19:50.723 --> 00:19:56.729
and it might be a little
obvious, but (Indiscernible) and

00:20:06.305 --> 00:20:10.076
we want to figure out what are
our attempted targets and what

00:20:10.076 --> 00:20:12.511
hatches are missing from those
targets and what is our

00:20:12.511 --> 00:20:18.517
environment is configured
properly. We found that SIDS was

00:20:22.154 --> 00:20:28.160
exposed to the open environment.
Many of us panicked. Many of

00:20:35.835 --> 00:20:41.841
them were on the Xbox's and in
2013. We asked the question, why

00:20:52.017 --> 00:20:58.023
is it set-up that way? Why would
you put them on the Internet

00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:14.106
that way? It is never a good
Windows and of course, there are

00:21:24.283 --> 00:21:30.289
VPN's and a million way to do
those things and instead of

00:21:39.198 --> 00:21:45.204
saying close those ports and
have a nice day. To realize

00:21:52.878 --> 00:21:58.884
there is a gap in the
understanding and how they would

00:22:02.721 --> 00:22:08.727
be supported in the first place.
There is a related issue where

00:22:13.132 --> 00:22:19.138
the boxes need access to require
IP-based authentication and

00:22:23.342 --> 00:22:29.348
that's how they let them in. Not
only were the ports exposed, but

00:22:38.057 --> 00:22:41.360
they had static NATS set-up.
When they set-up the NATing and

00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:45.064
they put an inbound firewall
rule and anything and everything

00:22:45.064 --> 00:22:48.434
was coming into the inboxes. We
identified some technical

00:22:48.434 --> 00:22:52.137
problems and also, a business
problem that was broken. They

00:22:52.137 --> 00:22:56.609
should have never allowed that
firewall to be put in place as

00:22:56.609 --> 00:22:59.979
it was, right? There were
multiple decisions that were

00:22:59.979 --> 00:23:04.750
left in and they were unchecked
and we were afraid to change it

00:23:04.750 --> 00:23:08.487
because something might stop
working, so we are going to

00:23:08.487 --> 00:23:12.958
leave it alone. So, we resulted
-- we found not only those

00:23:12.958 --> 00:23:15.928
vulnerabilities, but there was
poor documentation and we

00:23:15.928 --> 00:23:20.766
couldn't figure out why it was
set-up the way it was and the

00:23:20.766 --> 00:23:24.870
broken process that allowed the
firewall get in the first place

00:23:24.870 --> 00:23:28.207
and lack of understanding of
what the specific requirements

00:23:28.207 --> 00:23:32.311
were. At this same organization,
we found there is an obsolete

00:23:32.311 --> 00:23:36.048
version of Java. Obsolete Java
shouldn't be a surprise and

00:23:36.048 --> 00:23:39.785
having it result in hundreds of
vulnerabilities shouldn't be a

00:23:39.785 --> 00:23:44.256
surprise either. But when we
asked, why is it set-up the way

00:23:44.256 --> 00:23:47.960
that it is? Well, we have a
specific application that

00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:52.064
requires that version of Java.
We called the vendor, which no

00:23:52.064 --> 00:23:56.168
one had done. Do you require
this specific version of Java?

00:23:56.168 --> 00:24:00.572
No, we require at least, that
version of Java. A very subtle

00:24:00.572 --> 00:24:05.044
detail was left out at the
client's site. If I were a

00:24:05.044 --> 00:24:10.249
cynical person and for those of
you that know me, I kind of am.

00:24:10.249 --> 00:24:15.087
I think they were using that as
an excuse of not updating Java

00:24:15.087 --> 00:24:20.960
in a large enter prize and there
was broken process and all of

00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:23.529
these things were benefits that
the organization got long after

00:24:23.529 --> 00:24:25.531
the scan was over. It happened
when we started working with the

00:24:25.531 --> 00:24:27.533
business units and the support
organizations to clear these

00:24:27.533 --> 00:24:29.535
things up. So, it is going to
provide a scheming tool and I it

00:24:29.535 --> 00:24:31.537
will provide information. This
is another thing that maybe

00:24:31.537 --> 00:24:33.539
obvious. I worked with another
client that were surprised to

00:24:33.539 --> 00:24:35.541
find out; not only will it tell
me (Indiscernible) and a good

00:24:35.541 --> 00:24:37.543
product will also fix it. This
client only saw the result of

00:24:37.543 --> 00:24:39.545
the scan in a spreadsheet and
the IP address name and what

00:24:39.545 --> 00:24:41.547
went wrong with it. When we
provided the information, it

00:24:41.547 --> 00:24:43.549
became hugely valuable to this
organization. No, they knew not

00:24:43.549 --> 00:24:45.551
only what was wrong and how to
fix it. It is impossible for any

00:24:45.551 --> 00:24:47.553
of us to know everything. They
may not know. Make sure you take

00:24:47.553 --> 00:24:49.555
advantage of the information
that is in the tool that you are

00:24:49.555 --> 00:24:51.557
using. I have a pretty good idea
of what is on my home network

00:24:51.557 --> 00:24:53.559
and what is on everywhere across
the whole organization and that

00:24:53.559 --> 00:24:55.561
might not be true. Here is where
you have to make a decision. Are

00:24:55.561 --> 00:24:57.563
you going to scan a specific set
of hosts or everything that is

00:24:57.563 --> 00:24:59.565
out there? Those are two
different activities and

00:24:59.565 --> 00:25:01.500
problems, but I think that we
should do them both. A client

00:25:01.500 --> 00:25:06.939
that I worked with scanned all
of the cyber blocks that we knew

00:25:06.939 --> 00:25:11.577
about. And at the end of the
engagement, we decided, let's

00:25:11.577 --> 00:25:16.181
scan the stuff that doesn't
exist and the networks that are

00:25:16.181 --> 00:25:18.684
completely undocumented.
Obviously, the switches didn't

00:25:18.684 --> 00:25:23.288
turn themselves on and the hosts
didn't turn themselves on. And

00:25:23.288 --> 00:25:27.493
someone did it in the
organization. Maybe, we can find

00:25:27.493 --> 00:25:32.531
parts of the network that we
didn't know was there. And the

00:25:32.531 --> 00:25:37.569
range of IP addresses that work
on your networks and try and

00:25:37.569 --> 00:25:42.174
figure out what is there. One
client that I'm working with,

00:25:42.174 --> 00:25:44.176
when you do that, scan these
huge blocks, you end up creating

00:25:44.176 --> 00:25:49.648
a very, very nice inventory of
what exists on your network and

00:25:49.648 --> 00:25:54.053
the information management, it
is helpful to share that

00:25:54.053 --> 00:25:58.957
information with them. Now,
there is a check for the

00:25:58.957 --> 00:26:05.564
day-to-day data that have. At
that point, it is not a security

00:26:05.564 --> 00:26:09.501
related issue as it is asset
management. Still very important

00:26:09.501 --> 00:26:14.740
if you don't know what is on
your network and how can you

00:26:14.740 --> 00:26:19.545
possibly secure it? A large
number of IP cameras were not on

00:26:19.545 --> 00:26:24.383
anybody's list and it was a
little embedded system and not a

00:26:24.383 --> 00:26:28.787
computer so much that anyone
cared about. Many of them were

00:26:28.787 --> 00:26:31.623
configured incorrectly with
default credentials and just

00:26:31.623 --> 00:26:36.829
because IP didn't care; it was a
huge win for the client because

00:26:36.829 --> 00:26:41.667
they fixed what could have been
a very big problem. The same

00:26:41.667 --> 00:26:46.105
client and again, it wasn't a
security-related issue, but we

00:26:46.105 --> 00:26:48.340
found some Nintendo machines on
the network. It was a children's

00:26:48.340 --> 00:26:50.576
hospital, so it was okay. It
illustrated the point if IT

00:26:50.576 --> 00:26:53.011
didn't know they were there and
then, you have to ask the

00:26:53.011 --> 00:26:55.447
question, I have gaming consoles
that are on the same network as

00:26:55.447 --> 00:26:57.449
my production equipment. And
that drives the question, how is

00:26:57.449 --> 00:26:59.685
our network configured and are
we doing it the appropriate way?

00:26:59.685 --> 00:27:02.454
And the best way that we can.
The next company, they had a lot

00:27:02.454 --> 00:27:04.490
of oilrigs in Mexico. Every
platform has exactly four hosts

00:27:04.490 --> 00:27:07.125
on it and that's exactly what
you are going to find. And we

00:27:07.125 --> 00:27:09.561
did the scan and most of the
platforms did have exactly four

00:27:09.561 --> 00:27:11.997
hosts and that's fine. There
were a couple that had more than

00:27:11.997 --> 00:27:14.633
that. We went back to the client
and said there are hot IP

00:27:14.633 --> 00:27:16.635
addresses coming off of this
rig. They were interested in

00:27:16.635 --> 00:27:19.071
what those feeds were. Finding
out what is on our network in

00:27:19.071 --> 00:27:21.306
the first place. And an asset
management is very much network

00:27:21.306 --> 00:27:24.142
and if you don't find out what
is on it, you are screwed at

00:27:24.142 --> 00:27:26.578
what you are doing. I think
that's very, very true and why

00:27:26.578 --> 00:27:29.214
we should spend our time making
sure that we get to every corner

00:27:29.214 --> 00:27:31.216
of our network that we can.
Speaking with software

00:27:31.216 --> 00:27:33.218
management. Do you know each
machine that is in your

00:27:33.218 --> 00:27:35.220
enterprise that you are
scanning? And doing the

00:27:35.220 --> 00:27:37.222
credential scans and do we scan
with or without credentials and

00:27:37.222 --> 00:27:41.860
obviously, you are going to get
a lot of information and the

00:27:41.860 --> 00:27:47.866
scanning tool is going to allow
us to enumerate everything that

00:27:50.002 --> 00:27:56.008
is on the box and once we do the
scan, we can go back and run the

00:28:02.548 --> 00:28:08.554
reports and find out if there is
anything there and maybe if you

00:28:11.423 --> 00:28:16.929
standardize on Internet explorer
and what about BitTorrent and

00:28:16.929 --> 00:28:19.431
Kazaa. Compliance and on some
level we are flinging things and

00:28:19.431 --> 00:28:21.433
scanning the packets and you can
learn about what the

00:28:21.433 --> 00:28:23.435
organization is and what the
activities that are needed to

00:28:23.435 --> 00:28:25.437
make them more secure. Is
compliance an issue for you?

00:28:25.437 --> 00:28:27.439
Compliance an issue for anyone?
A few hands. If it is HIPPA or

00:28:27.439 --> 00:28:29.441
GOBA, your scanner should be
able to tell you (Indiscernible)

00:28:29.441 --> 00:28:31.443
relative to something else. That
could be important if you do

00:28:31.443 --> 00:28:33.445
work with the folks or the
client's folks and make sure

00:28:33.445 --> 00:28:35.447
that you are taking advantage of
the fact that you can gather

00:28:35.447 --> 00:28:37.449
that information and make sure
that you are compliant of what

00:28:37.449 --> 00:28:39.451
your health status is.
Strategically, the information

00:28:39.451 --> 00:28:41.453
that we are gathering should be
important to our networks as

00:28:41.453 --> 00:28:43.455
well. I will use the word again
because I like it; I'm talking

00:28:43.455 --> 00:28:45.457
about these longitudinal scans
over time. It is not a scan at

00:28:45.457 --> 00:28:47.459
the point in time
(Indiscernible) the trends that

00:28:47.459 --> 00:28:49.461
are developing and you need to
do these scans. That can be very

00:28:49.461 --> 00:28:51.463
important in an unexpected way.
If you are looking and

00:28:51.463 --> 00:28:53.465
continuing to see that, you find
vulnerabilities and it is fixed

00:28:53.465 --> 00:28:55.467
and maybe, you have a resourcing
problem. If something happens

00:28:55.467 --> 00:28:57.469
and all of a sudden, bash is
vulnerable. Strategically, it

00:28:57.469 --> 00:28:59.471
can be very, very important and
tactically, it can be very, very

00:28:59.471 --> 00:29:01.406
important, as well. Anyone work
in health care or work in

00:29:01.406 --> 00:29:03.408
environments that have
industrial control systems?

00:29:03.408 --> 00:29:05.410
Yeah, more hands. So, this is --
this conversation is going on a

00:29:05.410 --> 00:29:07.412
lot in our industry now and it
is going to continue because

00:29:07.412 --> 00:29:09.414
these systems in particular are
not the same as the other

00:29:09.414 --> 00:29:11.416
computers on our networks. The
biomedical devices and control

00:29:11.416 --> 00:29:13.418
systems and the things that help
run plants and refineries and

00:29:13.418 --> 00:29:15.420
whatnot are highly, highly
specialized and they are used to

00:29:15.420 --> 00:29:17.422
getting (Indiscernible)
specific. As you are throwing

00:29:17.422 --> 00:29:19.424
traffic at them -- the hot
button for me. Even though the

00:29:19.424 --> 00:29:21.426
FDA is getting stronger in
forcing equipment manufacturers,

00:29:21.426 --> 00:29:23.428
a lot of time you find that the
equipment manufacturers hide

00:29:23.428 --> 00:29:25.430
behind the FDA. Does anyone know
specifically what the FDA fight

00:29:25.430 --> 00:29:27.432
is and have to deal with it now?
Okay, the food and drug

00:29:27.432 --> 00:29:29.434
administration says before you
sell a medical device, you have

00:29:29.434 --> 00:29:31.436
to go through the FDA and once
the FDA says this is fine, you

00:29:31.436 --> 00:29:33.438
can't make any changes to it.
That becomes a problem when I

00:29:33.438 --> 00:29:35.440
say that you need to patch your
x-ray machine, the -- the

00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:37.442
problem with health care and
sometimes, it can lead to poor

00:29:37.442 --> 00:29:39.444
design decisions and with
radiology divisions and that's a

00:29:39.444 --> 00:29:41.446
problem in this hospital. The
vendor supported it with FTP and

00:29:41.446 --> 00:29:43.448
all of these stations had FTP
running on it. And setting it up

00:29:43.448 --> 00:29:45.450
and the logons that are enabled
and they enabled the FTP route

00:29:45.450 --> 00:29:47.452
and who this the world would
ever do that? Buy me a beer and

00:29:47.452 --> 00:29:49.454
I will tell you who did that.
Everyone on this network had FTP

00:29:49.454 --> 00:29:51.456
access to the file system and it
is the worst thing possibly

00:29:51.456 --> 00:29:54.660
ever. Normally, if you scan and
see FTP and maybe the return

00:29:54.660 --> 00:29:58.363
valves at the refineries and the
technology and they are not the

00:29:58.363 --> 00:30:01.733
same as information technology
at all. Shutting down a plant to

00:30:01.733 --> 00:30:04.803
do maintenance in computers and
their patch cycles maybe in

00:30:04.803 --> 00:30:08.206
months or years. If you find
yourself working on these types

00:30:08.206 --> 00:30:11.276
(Indiscernible) you need to make
sure that the OTP people

00:30:11.276 --> 00:30:14.079
understand that once you find
the vulnerability, the OTP

00:30:14.079 --> 00:30:17.749
patches are not going to be that
simple. They are purpose built

00:30:17.749 --> 00:30:20.852
and very, very specific and if
you get unusual traffic,

00:30:20.852 --> 00:30:24.222
(Indiscernible) at all. Be very,
very cautious. I know that I'm

00:30:24.222 --> 00:30:27.325
running out of time and
basically, the story I'm trying

00:30:27.325 --> 00:30:31.630
to tell you is that scanning has
been around for a long time and

00:30:31.630 --> 00:30:35.334
it has matured to be a lot more
useful and becoming shared

00:30:35.334 --> 00:30:39.304
appropriately and look for the
opportunities to share this data

00:30:39.304 --> 00:30:45.310
with your organization and if
you come up with a data

00:31:00.992 --> 00:31:06.998
manageability program that
shares all of these processes,

00:31:52.644 --> 00:31:58.650
it will help you. Thank you very
much for sitting through all of

00:32:45.697 --> 00:32:51.703
that and enjoy DEF CON 23. Thank
you. [ APPLAUSE ]
