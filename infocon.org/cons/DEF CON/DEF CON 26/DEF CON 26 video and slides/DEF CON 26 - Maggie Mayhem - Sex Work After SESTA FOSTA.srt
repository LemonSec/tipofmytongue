00:00:00.000-->00:00:06.173
>>Hello there. I think there is
no greater pleasure on Earth
than doing dangerous things with

00:00:06.173-->00:00:12.246
competent people and so I’m so
honored to be among your ranks.
Thank you so much to all the

00:00:12.246-->00:00:16.483
Goons and to the conference for
having me. I know I’m a little
bit of an untraditional talk.

00:00:16.483-->00:00:22.923
What I have to say may thrill
you, it may shock you, it may
even horrify you. What I am not

00:00:22.923-->00:00:28.595
going to do today is try to
provide a case for why sex work
is or is not moral. Instead what

00:00:28.595-->00:00:33.233
I would like to convey is why
this warrantless surveillance is
not only an erosion of our

00:00:33.233-->00:00:38.405
collective civil liberties but
it also presents a clear and
lethal danger to those in the

00:00:38.405-->00:00:43.410
sex trade. So this is a very uh
a chant that’s near and dear to
my heart when sex worker rights

00:00:46.980-->00:00:51.985
are under attack what do we do?
Get dressed, fight back! And who
am I? I’ve done a thing or two

00:00:55.355-->00:01:00.060
around the world. I have been on
the board of directors of the
sex workers outreach project USA

00:01:00.060-->00:01:04.998
doing national organizing. I
have spoken around the world on
sex worker rights. Harm

00:01:04.998-->00:01:10.637
reduction is also a cause that
is near and dear to my heart. I
also do birth work and I’m an

00:01:10.637-->00:01:15.642
apprentice death worker. So home
funerals, births, I got
everything. So what is

00:01:18.545-->00:01:24.785
SESTA/FOSTA? This is a piece of
legislation that was signed into
law by Donald Trump on A- April

00:01:24.785-->00:01:31.725
11th 2018. It is the Stop
Enabling Sex Traffickers Act and
the Fight Online Sex Trafficking

00:01:31.725-->00:01:37.898
Act. It kind of converged into 1
piece of horrible legislation
that has had all kinds of

00:01:37.898-->00:01:42.903
affects um resulting in 150 at
least documented tech actions.
Uh this has involved Craigslist,

00:01:45.372-->00:01:48.976
if any of you have been trying
to find a date on Craigslist,
you probably have had some

00:01:48.976-->00:01:54.348
trouble. Uh many other web sites
have also been shut down or
censored. We’re seeing an

00:01:54.348-->00:02:00.587
increased amount of shadow
banning um or out right removal
of sex workers from services. So

00:02:00.587-->00:02:06.360
what is this? Essentially what
this legislation did is it
eliminated section 230 of the

00:02:06.360-->00:02:11.365
Communications Decency Act. This
means that websites are now um
have increased liability for any

00:02:13.567-->00:02:19.373
third party content that is
posted. Uh so even if a website
doesn't know that someone may be

00:02:19.373-->00:02:24.878
buying or selling sex on their
website, they are now uh gonna
be in trouble for that. This

00:02:24.878-->00:02:31.451
means that there is increased
scrutiny on speech online and uh
it’s had as I said tremendous

00:02:31.451-->00:02:37.557
affects. Some of which have also
been surprising. It was uh
pretty horrifying to see the

00:02:37.557-->00:02:41.428
ripples of people who were
getting deleted from Twitter,
but a group of sex workers

00:02:41.428-->00:02:47.601
decided to create a Mastodon
Instance they called Switter. It
was up for a few days and

00:02:47.601-->00:02:51.605
thousands and thousands and
thousands of people flocked
there. In fact it was one of the

00:02:51.605-->00:02:56.610
largest instances of Mastodon.
It was hosted by CloudFlare and
CloudFlare has been very vocal

00:02:58.945-->00:03:05.352
about privacy and freedom.
They’ve only ever terminated uh
services for 1 client and that

00:03:05.352-->00:03:10.357
was the Daily Stormer. They shut
down Switter. They shut us down
and that is quite a

00:03:13.026-->00:03:17.531
disappointment because what was
Switter but essentially a group
of women, trans women, and uh

00:03:17.531-->00:03:22.502
male workers who were trying to
save their own lives. So to be
equated with something like the

00:03:22.502-->00:03:27.607
Daily Stormer was quite a slap
in the face. Especially from
people who had been such like

00:03:27.607-->00:03:32.612
crusaders and vocal outspoken
people about why we need spaces
like this. And what influenced

00:03:36.316-->00:03:41.455
this is the philosophy known as
the Nordic model. So up ‘till
now we’ve really had

00:03:41.455-->00:03:47.194
criminalization, which is where
we say uh “You can’t do that,
it’s bad.” People go after the

00:03:47.194-->00:03:53.066
sex workers, they go after the
buyers. Uh in New Zealand you
have a model called

00:03:53.066-->00:03:57.404
Decriminalisation, and
Decriminalisation is when you
remove criminal penalties from

00:03:57.404-->00:04:02.242
any buying or selling. Uh in
fact the United Nations has had
a few people who have gone on

00:04:02.242-->00:04:06.680
the record saying “If you wanna
be a sex worker anywhere in the
world, do it in New Zealand.”

00:04:06.680-->00:04:12.853
Some people have said that the
Nordic model is a middle ground
because it criminalizes the

00:04:12.853-->00:04:17.858
buying but not the selling of
sexual services. It is guided by
the idea that you can end demand

00:04:21.328-->00:04:26.333
for sex. Uh this is actually a
little bit difficult. Uh
[laughter]. Sex work has been

00:04:29.169-->00:04:34.608
going on for a very very long
time. As long as there are haves
and there are have nots,

00:04:34.608-->00:04:41.181
negotiations will occur between
the 2 parties. And while I agree
it’s very important to protect

00:04:41.181-->00:04:45.752
people who may be vulnerable to
exploitation, I think we need to
do a little bit more of a

00:04:45.752-->00:04:50.457
careful look at why anyone is so
vulnerable to that kind of
economic exploitation in the

00:04:50.457-->00:04:55.462
first place. And here again here
is one of the quotes from some
of the uh lovely law enforcement

00:04:57.631-->00:05:01.535
officers talking about what
they’re trying to accomplish.
They’re really hoping that they

00:05:01.535-->00:05:06.540
can end demand, and if they can
just end this demand, nothing
bad will ever happen ever again.

00:05:08.575-->00:05:13.580
So we’ve seen a move from the
model of criminalization uh of
the bad girls, into the sad

00:05:15.982-->00:05:22.222
girls, the victims of
trafficking rather than women
who have gone astray. And this

00:05:22.222-->00:05:26.493
may- again does sound tempting,
it does sound like something
that’s going to be better, or is

00:05:26.493-->00:05:31.498
going to be helpful. And yet
it’s important to remember that
asymmetric enforcement of a law

00:05:33.767-->00:05:39.973
will always infringe on the
fundamental rights of the non
criminal party. There is no way

00:05:39.973-->00:05:45.478
to enforce laws like this
without impacting sex workers
themselves. And in fact laws

00:05:45.478-->00:05:50.784
like this make sex workers more
vulnerable. We’ve seen this
around the world, especially in

00:05:50.784-->00:05:55.622
Sweden where this was uh,
originated. There was no
research that went into this.

00:05:55.622-->00:06:00.927
There was no communication with
those in the sex trade about how
to implement it or how to

00:06:00.927-->00:06:07.067
enforce it. And it drives
negotiations into a system where
the worker has to protect the

00:06:07.067-->00:06:13.139
buyer. It makes it a lot harder
to get information to screen, um
it essentially drives things

00:06:13.139-->00:06:19.479
further underground and further
away from resources. It also
comes with a lot of baggage;

00:06:19.479-->00:06:25.886
because someone who could be
profiting from sexual labor can
be also uh a landlord. There are

00:06:25.886-->00:06:30.924
people that are being kicked out
of their homes. If you have 2 or
more sexworkers in any given

00:06:30.924-->00:06:36.763
location, that is a brothel or a
body house, that is illegal. So
you can’t work together, you

00:06:36.763-->00:06:42.168
can’t live somewhere. And those
who are being accused of being
uh traffickers are often

00:06:42.168-->00:06:47.807
partners, they are parents, they
are children and they are
friends; and they are not being

00:06:47.807-->00:06:53.546
distinguished from those who
have ill intent. It’s been a
very popular thing outside of

00:06:53.546-->00:06:58.351
Nordic countries. This is a map
of the continental United States
where End Demand programs have

00:06:58.351-->00:07:03.290
been implemented. I couldn’t
quite fit the slide quite right
but this is happening in Alaska

00:07:03.290-->00:07:08.295
and Hawaii as well. And you can
see how much it’s spread. And
yet as we all know, if you build

00:07:11.598-->00:07:18.071
a better rat trap, you will
always have a better rat. Sex
workers are really very good at

00:07:18.071-->00:07:22.809
evading uh any type of law
enforcement because their lives
and their livelihood depends on

00:07:22.809-->00:07:28.181
it. So every time there’s ever
been something, uh, a barrier
erected, there are sex workers

00:07:28.181-->00:07:33.420
who have figured out how to go
around it. We do the best we can
but sometimes this new

00:07:33.420-->00:07:39.826
legislation makes it a lot
harder. There’s been a lot of
surveillance on sex workers, it

00:07:39.826-->00:07:45.699
goes back quite, quite a great
of time back. Um in the 60’s
they started doing uh s- uh

00:07:45.699-->00:07:49.536
buyers stings. So instead of
focusing on the sellers they
were looking on getting clients

00:07:49.536-->00:07:54.541
or Johns. Uh the first internet
based buyer sting was in Everett
Washington. They began

00:07:58.178-->00:08:03.850
publishing names of people in
the news paper in the 70s. The
Dear John letter campaigns

00:08:03.850-->00:08:09.556
encouraged neighbors to provide
information about who they had
seen, license plate numbers, and

00:08:09.556-->00:08:16.129
they would send notices to homes
that were actually designed to
be opened by wives or mothers.

00:08:16.129-->00:08:20.834
So if you can’t arrest somebody,
you can always shame them. We
started seeing surveillance

00:08:20.834-->00:08:26.272
cameras that were put in areas
that were known for uh any type
of commerce. And yet by

00:08:26.272-->00:08:32.078
coincidence these were often low
income neighborhoods or
neighborhoods of color. There is

00:08:32.078-->00:08:36.850
just as much sexual commerce
happening at the Ritz Carlton as
there is at a Motel 6 off a

00:08:36.850-->00:08:42.655
highway; but you don’t always
see the same kinds of
surveillance there. Neighborhood

00:08:42.655-->00:08:46.426
actions targeting Johns were a
lot of groups and community
groups that were teaching people

00:08:46.426-->00:08:52.165
how to do this. And since then
we have seen license plate
readers erected um and many

00:08:52.165-->00:08:57.170
other forms of intense
surveillance. A human rights
attorney in San Leandro where a

00:08:59.406-->00:09:03.276
large neighborhood action was
set up had a great quote: “This
turns neighbors against

00:09:03.276-->00:09:07.647
neighbors and it recruits people
to become spies for the police.
It’s not healthy for these

00:09:07.647-->00:09:12.485
communities.” It makes us
suspicious of each other. It
makes us create arbitrary ideas

00:09:12.485-->00:09:17.056
for who should be in a
neighborhood and who shouldn't.
Uh and as we will continue to

00:09:17.056-->00:09:22.028
see these designations are,
they’re arbitrary and they’re
capricious. There’s only 2

00:09:22.028-->00:09:28.134
things that distinguish
commercial sex from recreational
sex, that is communication and

00:09:28.134-->00:09:34.474
association. Unlike other crimes
it’s hard to actually pinpoint
something. I don’t necessarily

00:09:34.474-->00:09:38.812
agree with the drug laws on our
books but either you have drugs
on you or you don’t or they were

00:09:38.812-->00:09:45.718
planted. If you kill somebody we
can do forensics to find out a
body and how it came to be dead.

00:09:45.718-->00:09:51.191
If you steal money, there’s a
trail. But again with sex work,
that’s a little bit harder. So

00:09:51.191-->00:09:56.396
people are often targeted for
the way they are dressed, where
they are standing, and who they

00:09:56.396-->00:10:01.434
are associating with. And again
this is what makes it so
arbitrary. We’ve seen people

00:10:01.434-->00:10:06.306
that have been uh arrested and
searched and condoms that
they’ve had on their person have

00:10:06.306-->00:10:11.311
been used as evidence against
them. Condoms. Those are legal.
They’re sold everywhere. And

00:10:14.080-->00:10:19.819
this is dangerous when you
consider HIV and STIs and STDs.
If you’re gonna be penalized for

00:10:19.819-->00:10:24.824
having protection, why would you
carry it? And uh the department
of homeland security has been

00:10:28.862-->00:10:34.567
increasing a lot of uh their own
types of outreach campaigns. I
was looking at the uh Twitter

00:10:34.567-->00:10:39.239
stream and I noticed a lot of
people were very upset that
their rooms were being searched.

00:10:39.239-->00:10:45.178
Providers have been following
this for a long time. Some of
their training includes uh

00:10:45.178-->00:10:50.183
targeting the uh janitorial
staff, the hospitality staff in
general. And uh you’ll note on

00:10:52.318-->00:10:57.323
the left hand side, I’ll point
to “presence of multiple
computers, cell phones, pagers,

00:10:57.323-->00:11:02.262
credit card swipers, and other
technology.” Uh oh. [audience
laughter] Uh oh. And in fact

00:11:06.533-->00:11:10.870
it’s even a little bit more
detailed. It may be hard to read
some of this but they include

00:11:10.870-->00:11:15.875
other very arbitrary things
like: declining cleaning, a
strong smell of musk, men coming

00:11:18.311-->00:11:24.417
and going, drugs and alcohol,
pornography. There’s a lot of
reasons why you may be enjoying

00:11:24.417-->00:11:29.622
your hotel stay, it doesn’t mean
that you’re a human trafficker.
And again who is going to be

00:11:29.622-->00:11:35.028
targeted more specifically for
having or behaving in a manner
like this? Another thing that I

00:11:35.028-->00:11:39.332
noticed that really stood out to
me is that on all of these
fliers and on all of this

00:11:39.332-->00:11:44.337
training that was being
provided, people are told and
encouraged not to approach a

00:11:44.337-->00:11:50.677
suspected victim. They are told
that the first thing they should
do is contact ICE, immigrations

00:11:50.677-->00:11:55.682
And customs. And that was really
very curios. ICE has been very
involved in a lot of this and a

00:11:57.951-->00:12:04.424
lot of that is because people do
migrate to do sexual labor. Uh
it’s not always going to be as

00:12:04.424-->00:12:08.261
profitable to work in your own
home country, sometimes you
travel to work and that is the

00:12:08.261-->00:12:13.533
case for many people in the sex
trade. They’re not necessarily
being forced against their will,

00:12:13.533-->00:12:18.004
they’re just following the
money. They're doing the best
they can. And we have these

00:12:18.004-->00:12:24.210
raids, they’re called rescues,
but there’s no coco, there’s no
teddy bears, there’s no one

00:12:24.210-->00:12:30.783
there to help you. Instead it’s
going to be incarceration or
deportation and prostitution is

00:12:30.783-->00:12:35.555
a deportable offense. So out of
1 side of their mouth they’re
using this terminology of

00:12:35.555-->00:12:41.127
“victims” and “rescue.” On the
other hand, there doesn't seem
to be anything in place that

00:12:41.127-->00:12:47.600
actually makes this a rescue.
There’s only 150 beds in the
whole United States that are

00:12:47.600-->00:12:54.040
designated for human trafficking
victims. 150 beds. And yet
sometimes there are raids that

00:12:54.040-->00:12:59.045
have 150 individuals in any
given raid in any given specific
location. I also found it very

00:13:01.247-->00:13:06.619
curious that there has been a
campaign to talk to university
students. That is the item that

00:13:06.619-->00:13:13.259
you see on the uh right. Uh I
don’t know very many human
traffickers that are like going

00:13:13.259-->00:13:18.064
to exploit someone sexually but
they want them to get a good
college education. But that’s

00:13:18.064-->00:13:23.069
what this uh image seems to
imply. It says to be aware of
people who are getting a lot of

00:13:26.806-->00:13:31.911
gifts and male attention and
seem to have a handler who won’t
let them out of their site. I’ve

00:13:31.911-->00:13:37.316
never seen this on a campus
though it may happen. And again
students are being encouraged to

00:13:37.316-->00:13:42.321
call ICE. The National Overview
of Prostitution and Sex
Trafficking Demand Reduction

00:13:45.558-->00:13:51.597
Efforts had a report in 2012. I
recommend reading it, it’s a
really horrific document and it

00:13:51.597-->00:13:56.035
outlines that there just simply
isn’t anything there for those
who may be rescued or may

00:13:56.035-->00:14:02.675
actually be a victim. “While it
is necessary and just to assist
survivors, an expansion of those

00:14:02.675-->00:14:08.915
services is acutely needed, the
interventions are not designed
to prevent or reduce the

00:14:08.915-->00:14:13.920
occurence of exploitation.” Big
mother is watching. And she
wants to end demand no matter

00:14:16.823-->00:14:21.828
what kind of damage or casualty
there may be. Some of these
stings are also very very brutal

00:14:24.330-->00:14:29.469
in general, and pretty much most
of them are. At some of the
raids in the United Kingdom, uh

00:14:29.469-->00:14:36.342
press was called ahead of time
and the uh victims were dragged
out into the street without any

00:14:36.342-->00:14:41.481
opportunity to cover themselves.
They were still in negligee and
lingerie. That doesn’t sound

00:14:41.481-->00:14:47.720
like a rescue effort to me. And
in one of these cases uh a lot
of law enforcement found that it

00:14:47.720-->00:14:53.526
would be a little expensive to
actually post as an escort. You
gotta rent a room, you gotta

00:14:53.526-->00:14:58.331
post these ads and they’re
asking for money and there's
this budget. They actually found

00:14:58.331-->00:15:02.935
it was a lot easier to find
someone who was legitimate who
was working in their own room

00:15:02.935-->00:15:07.940
and uh remove the survivor and
install a police decoy. So what
happens to this survivor? Was

00:15:12.278-->00:15:17.950
she cooperating? She has her
phone seized and uh all of her
appointments for the day, things

00:15:17.950-->00:15:22.955
that were negotiated in good
faith are gonna run afoul. And
most of this law enforcement

00:15:25.825-->00:15:31.697
response has really been driven
by complaints from people rather
than any actual concern. We know

00:15:31.697-->00:15:38.137
that at least 71 percent are
definitely from complaints but
it’s likely much higher. And

00:15:38.137-->00:15:45.144
public shaming, this could be
billboards posting pictures of
buyers or sellers, um or having

00:15:45.144-->00:15:51.951
a Dear John campaign will like
drop those complaints. So
officers really like that, it

00:15:51.951-->00:15:56.956
makes it very convenient. And
again no punitive response up to
and including the death penalty

00:15:59.992-->00:16:05.231
has ever effectively halted
commercial sex at any time in
history. So we know that it’s

00:16:05.231-->00:16:11.137
not actually doing anything to
stop this supposed problem, it’s
just a great cover up or a

00:16:11.137-->00:16:16.142
bandaid. And what kind of things
have we lost? This is a
screencap from MyPinkBook. This

00:16:18.678-->00:16:24.016
was a side message board of
Myredbook which was a California
based message board. It was

00:16:24.016-->00:16:29.188
where ads were posted and uh as
you can see this is this is the
type of speech that was being

00:16:29.188-->00:16:35.194
halted. This is health
information. These are legal
services. This isn’t necessarily

00:16:35.194-->00:16:40.700
trafficking at all, this is sex
workers helping sex workers. It
was also a place where sex

00:16:40.700-->00:16:47.039
workers were able to become more
independent. Uh in the past a
pimp has been necessary uh

00:16:47.039-->00:16:51.143
because there’s so much work
that goes into things. If you’re
arrested, who’s gonna bail you

00:16:51.143-->00:16:57.383
out? If you need security, who's
gonna provide it? Who knows
where you are and what you need?

00:16:57.383-->00:17:03.055
So oftentimes sex workers have
been employees of people but
with the rise of the internet

00:17:03.055-->00:17:07.793
they were able to become a boss
and were able to hire out the
services they need. That could

00:17:07.793-->00:17:13.599
be a driver, that could be a
lawyer, that could be someone
who knows how to make paychecks

00:17:13.599-->00:17:18.838
and pay stubs if you need to
rent something. And so it was
incredibly powerful to be able

00:17:18.838-->00:17:23.843
to be in charge rather than to
be a worker. We also know in a
recent study that the Craigslist

00:17:27.680-->00:17:32.685
erotic services reduced the
female homicide rate by 17 point
4 percent. That’s incredible.

00:17:35.788-->00:17:40.960
Purely by virtue of having a
place where people could meet
clients and screen them, the

00:17:40.960-->00:17:45.665
overall homicide rate dropped.
We’re here at this conference
and we all know that it’s not

00:17:45.665-->00:17:51.837
necessarily safe to answer an
email, but it’s a lot safer to
answer an email than it is to

00:17:51.837-->00:17:56.842
stick your head in a car window.
So if you’d like to see that, I
really recommend you read it.

00:17:58.844-->00:18:03.582
And in San Francisco, even these
are uh people who were
proponents of the Nordic model

00:18:03.582-->00:18:08.955
noted, that the average yield of
arrest per street level sting
fell by half between 2004 and

00:18:08.955-->00:18:14.827
2007. That’s when Craigslist
became popularized. So actually
the amount of street based

00:18:14.827-->00:18:20.232
traffic dropped, it dropped
considerably. Because even
though we’re talking about using

00:18:20.232-->00:18:25.237
computer and digital services,
smartphones became much more uh
uh available to people and most

00:18:27.940-->00:18:33.980
providers were able to post ads
uh and work on the street or
just move indoors entirely. In

00:18:33.980-->00:18:40.086
fact on the street in general
there are oftentimes people who
will have their ad posted,

00:18:40.086-->00:18:43.589
they’ll have a room waiting, and
if they’re not getting any
business maybe they’ll go

00:18:43.589-->00:18:49.595
downstairs but pretty much
everybody was using the
internet. And this is a

00:18:49.595-->00:18:55.067
dangerous job. Being a sex
worker is the most dangerous job
in America. So when we talk

00:18:55.067-->00:19:01.340
about this reduction in uh in
numbers, it’s a very very large
un- uh thing. It’s no small

00:19:01.340-->00:19:07.179
feat. Women represent 22 percent
of all homicide victims but 70
percent of serial killer

00:19:07.179-->00:19:12.385
victims. This is why December
17th the International Day to
End Violence Against Sex Workers

00:19:12.385-->00:19:18.257
was started. The Green River
Killer made it very clear who he
was targeting and why. Sex

00:19:18.257-->00:19:23.696
workers are 18 times more likely
to be a victim of homicide than
other women. And 50 percent of

00:19:23.696-->00:19:29.168
sex worker homicides will go
unsolved. This is a community
that doesn't have any justice,

00:19:29.168-->00:19:34.173
and the 1 tool that they had to
protect themselves was ripped
out from underneath them. I have

00:19:36.409-->00:19:42.148
some of my sources up here, if
you’d like to check some of
them. Which I hope you will. And

00:19:42.148-->00:19:46.052
I hope you will always
scrutinize the statistics that
you hear because so many of them

00:19:46.052-->00:19:51.424
have been based on falsehoods.
The average age of entry into
the sex trade is not 12 years

00:19:51.424-->00:19:56.429
old, it’s closer to 19. It is
safer to have these message
boards, not more dangerous. And

00:19:59.432-->00:20:03.369
even though I’m saying some
pretty harsh stuff I’m a sex
worker so you know I believe in

00:20:03.369-->00:20:08.374
happy endings. [crowd laughs]
I’ve seen us have success when
people stand up with us and

00:20:10.543-->00:20:17.483
fight back. I have seen bad laws
in California struck down. I
have seen change made. So I

00:20:17.483-->00:20:21.187
believe that the more people
know, and the more people are
willing to speak up to their

00:20:21.187-->00:20:25.124
politicians and their law
enforcement communities that
this can be reversed and we can

00:20:25.124-->00:20:30.229
have an internet that is safe
for sex workers, where the civil
liberties of all of ours are

00:20:30.229-->00:20:35.234
protected, and uh we can all
have our happy ending. Thank you
very much. [applause]
