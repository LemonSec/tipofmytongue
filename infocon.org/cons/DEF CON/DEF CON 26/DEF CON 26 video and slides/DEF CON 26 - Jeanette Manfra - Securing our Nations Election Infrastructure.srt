00:00:00.133-->00:00:04.738
>>I’d Like to introduce this
morning, Jeanette Manfra with
the talk, securing our nation’s

00:00:04.738-->00:00:09.743
election infrastructure. Enjoy!
[Applause] >>Thank you so much
and good morning. Uh, uh, I was

00:00:17.184-->00:00:22.456
hoping you all would sleep in
and I could do this with maybe
just ten people. Not terrifying

00:00:22.456-->00:00:27.461
at all to stand up and see you.
So first, uh, thank you so much
for coming, both to DefCon and

00:00:29.596-->00:00:35.936
to this speech. Uh, I wanted to
just spend about 15 to 20
minutes, talk to you about how

00:00:35.936-->00:00:41.441
we feel about election security
and also uh, you know, sort of
extrapolate a little bit about

00:00:41.441-->00:00:46.246
um how that relates to our
approach to critical
infrastructure overall. Uh, I

00:00:46.246-->00:00:51.652
also want to point out that this
is my son’s first DefCon. He’s
very excited. He’s six!

00:00:51.652-->00:00:56.657
[Applause] So, we’ll bring him
by the voting village later. So,
um for the- a little closer?

00:01:03.897-->00:01:10.437
Sorry, I’m a wanderer when I
speak. I’ll try to stay still.
So for those of you who don’t

00:01:10.437-->00:01:15.776
know what DHS does, and I do
apologize up front. I can’t help
myself. I’m going to say cyber

00:01:15.776-->00:01:22.049
and cyber security probably a
lot. It’s just the way we talk
in D.C. So, just accept it; I

00:01:22.049-->00:01:26.620
have. Um, so in a- at DHS, my
organization, we’re the office
of cybersecurity and

00:01:26.620-->00:01:31.625
communications and we stood up
about 11 years ago, to focus on
the purely defensive side of

00:01:33.794-->00:01:40.600
cyber security. And we have two
main roles, and we’ll talk-
maybe about three we can talk

00:01:40.600-->00:01:45.605
about. The first one, which uh,
we spend a lot of time on is uh,
protecting federal civilian

00:01:47.841-->00:01:53.046
networks. So the way the
government runs it actually is
somewhat complicated. Um- we uh-

00:01:53.046-->00:01:57.417
we- we don’t do I.T. governance
particularly well and we’ve made
it particularly complicated for

00:01:57.417-->00:02:01.788
ourselves, but I will spend 30
seconds and explain it um-
because it may be useful in a

00:02:01.788-->00:02:07.094
trivia game at some point in
your future. So, uh- the uh- the
DoD, alright, they’ve got-

00:02:07.094-->00:02:09.930
they’ve got their network,
they’re protecting that. The
intelligence community has their

00:02:09.930-->00:02:16.336
networks they’re protecting that
and uh- DHS is left with the 99
ish federal agencies and yes

00:02:16.336-->00:02:22.843
there are 99 federal agencies.
And uh, what we do, is we work
with them uh- to deploy

00:02:22.843-->00:02:28.382
technologies and capability to
better protect our- our
networks. And uh- what we’re

00:02:28.382-->00:02:33.920
evolving towards on the federal
side is thinking about, instead
of individual risk, every agency

00:02:33.920-->00:02:39.493
thinking about themselves is uh-
is owning one part, their own
part, much like many companies

00:02:39.493-->00:02:44.064
think about just themselves as
individual risk. We’re trying to
get to think about enterprise

00:02:44.064-->00:02:48.035
risk and think about the
government as a whole. We have a
lot of technologies and- and

00:02:48.035-->00:02:52.339
shared platforms and we have a
lot of adversaries that are
trying to get our information,

00:02:52.339-->00:02:57.411
whether that’s to steal citizen
information or whether that’s to
get information about uh-

00:02:57.411-->00:03:02.482
policies or other capabilities
that we’re thinking about. So we
have to think differently about

00:03:02.482-->00:03:07.954
how we uh- defend uh- those
systems within our federal
government and we’re doing a lot

00:03:07.954-->00:03:13.093
of work, we’ve been issuing a
lot of uh- directives to improve
the security and take advantage

00:03:13.093-->00:03:17.531
of uh- of different capabilities
of the private sector has
developed. So, that’s enough

00:03:17.531-->00:03:21.635
about the federal side. The
second part is uh- critical
infrastructure. So while I have

00:03:21.635-->00:03:25.705
the authority and the resources
to deploy technologies to tell
other federal agencies what they

00:03:25.705-->00:03:30.911
should do and importantly to
measure them on their progress.
With the private sector, it’s

00:03:30.911-->00:03:36.349
purely voluntary. And- and I
think that's important. I think
that’s the only way that we can

00:03:36.349-->00:03:42.322
be truly successful. And I’m
using the term ‘private sector’
very broadly and uh- the- and-

00:03:42.322-->00:03:48.628
that includes all of you in this
room whether you’re in a big
company or working for yourself.

00:03:48.628-->00:03:53.900
It also includes academic
institutions. Uh- It includes
state and locals as well. So we

00:03:53.900-->00:03:59.406
have a broad public private
partnership that we uh- as we
refer to it. That it- it has to

00:03:59.406-->00:04:05.112
work together to figure out how
we’re going to secure and defend
our critical infrastructure. So

00:04:05.112-->00:04:10.150
if you think about one of the
most fundamental roles of
government is to provide for the

00:04:10.150-->00:04:15.889
security and the defense of its
citizens, right? But the
internet has challenged

00:04:15.889-->00:04:20.327
everything when it comes to how
we think about the role of
government in defending and

00:04:20.327-->00:04:26.133
securing its citizens and its
infrastructure. And for all the
amazing benefits and economic

00:04:26.133-->00:04:31.571
development and uh- the social
benefits that has come with the
development of the internet and

00:04:31.571-->00:04:37.778
the technologies that leverage
it, it does create of course, a
lot of vulnerabilities, but I

00:04:37.778-->00:04:43.817
think most interestingly for-
for policy people, it- it really
challenges how you think about

00:04:43.817-->00:04:49.523
what the role of government is.
The role of government, we’ve
typically had the- the best

00:04:49.523-->00:04:55.629
advantage when it comes to
defending our country. We don’t
have that anymore. We have uh-

00:04:55.629-->00:05:00.066
some capability and it is
unique, for those of you who uh-
maybe took an international

00:05:00.066-->00:05:05.639
trade uh- class uh- once upon a
time. The concept of comparative
advantage. It applies here, but

00:05:05.639-->00:05:09.843
in a different way. So the
government, right- we can go
places and we can do things and

00:05:09.843-->00:05:14.781
invest in places that- you- the
private sector or other entities
are not allowed to or the- you

00:05:14.781-->00:05:19.619
don’t have the incentives to.
And um- and that can be useful
when we’re talking about

00:05:19.619-->00:05:25.425
bringing everything together.
Um- but we don’t have that
unique advantage and we don’t

00:05:25.425-->00:05:32.065
have all the information. And
uh- so what we’ve been talking
about a lot, and I’ll get to

00:05:32.065-->00:05:37.070
elections in a second, is the
concept of collective defense.
And what this means, and there’s

00:05:39.306-->00:05:44.778
a lot of different analogies
that uh- that people talk about-
best athlete, comparative

00:05:44.778-->00:05:51.418
advantage, but- but the concept
of that - the government is just
one player in a community of

00:05:51.418-->00:05:57.490
organizations and individuals
that all have some capability
that they can bring, some of

00:05:57.490-->00:06:01.795
which are better than what the
government can bring. And so for
the first time in a national

00:06:01.795-->00:06:06.967
security space, the government
is not on the front lines. Our
companies on the front lines,

00:06:06.967-->00:06:12.672
our citizens on the front lines,
all of you are on the front
lines. And uh- And that sounds

00:06:12.672-->00:06:18.712
um- easy to say, but when you
start to really think that about
that, then it just challenges

00:06:18.712-->00:06:22.148
everything you think about, well
what does it mean, the role of
DoD, what does that mean about

00:06:22.148-->00:06:28.054
the intelligence community. What
does that mean about the role of
the private sector. And so, what

00:06:28.054-->00:06:32.325
it does mean though, is that we
have to get passed our
traditional incentives. In the

00:06:32.325-->00:06:37.097
government, our incentive is to
collect information and to
protect that information, in

00:06:37.097-->00:06:42.135
order to be able to execute our
security a defense missions. But
we can’t do that. We have to be

00:06:42.135-->00:06:46.606
able to share that information
and we have to be able to be
transparent and we have to build

00:06:46.606-->00:06:53.146
a level of trust with the uh-
wide variety of individuals
organizations and entities that

00:06:53.146-->00:06:59.753
we’ve never had to do before. On
the flip side, on the- on the
company side, the idea is to

00:06:59.753-->00:07:06.593
monetize information and
capability, which is fine. I’m a
capitalist, I want us to be uh-

00:07:06.593-->00:07:11.598
strong, economically powerful
country, but in this space, if
we’re going to truly be able to

00:07:13.633-->00:07:18.471
hold the adversaries of the same
level of risk that they’re
holding us, we have to be able

00:07:18.471-->00:07:23.843
to move passed that. We have to
be able to find other ways to
uh- to cooperate and we have to

00:07:23.843-->00:07:28.181
think differently about what are
the capabilities that each of us
needs to bring to bear to this

00:07:28.181-->00:07:34.821
fight. So that sort of thinking
is- is how we think about the
entire fight overall, if you

00:07:34.821-->00:07:39.693
will. Our adversaries have been
taking advantage of us for a
long time. They’ve been taking

00:07:39.693-->00:07:44.497
advantage of our traditional
principles for a really long
time. And we’ve got to figure

00:07:44.497-->00:07:49.235
out a way to turn it back on
them. And again, that means the
government has got to think

00:07:49.235-->00:07:53.106
differently, and that means
everybody has got to think
differently. So, I want to talk

00:07:53.106-->00:07:57.344
to you specifically about
elections. Um- though I’m happy
to talk about anything, from

00:07:57.344-->00:08:02.415
medical devices to our electric
grid after the- after the event
if you’re interested. So this

00:08:02.415-->00:08:05.785
slide that we’ve pulled
together, and this is my first
talk I’ve ever done with a slide

00:08:05.785-->00:08:10.790
so uh, we’ll see how it goes.
Um- this is how we think about
elections. And elections is more

00:08:12.826-->00:08:17.364
than just the voting machines. I
didn’t know a whole lot about
how our voting system worked

00:08:17.364-->00:08:22.902
before uh- DHS got involved and
I’ll tell you it’s tremendously
complex. The complexity is

00:08:22.902-->00:08:27.907
actually uh- a benefit. Um, but-
um, so what we started to look
at is um- and going back to

00:08:30.009-->00:08:35.882
2016, when we- um, when we first
started to understand that uh-
that the Russians were uh

00:08:35.882-->00:08:40.887
attempting to uh, undermine and
sow chaos and- and discord and
undermine our uh democracy in

00:08:43.289-->00:08:47.293
general. Which by the way,
they’ve been trying to do this
for decades. It’s just that

00:08:47.293-->00:08:53.666
technology has allowed them to
do it at a better scale. So, um-
So we stepped back, we talked

00:08:53.666-->00:08:58.371
with a lot of election experts
and we said ‘okay, explain how
this system actually works’. And

00:08:58.371-->00:09:03.109
then we worked with intelligence
communities and others and we
said okay if an adversary wants

00:09:03.109-->00:09:09.516
to undermine our democratic
process, how could they do that?
And so this is um- and and you

00:09:09.516-->00:09:13.620
know don’t think- we have stuff
up here on election day, it
doesn’t necessarily happen on

00:09:13.620-->00:09:19.993
the day of election. But the
concept of- you’ve got
everything from uh voters trying

00:09:19.993-->00:09:26.699
to register to actually casting
the ballots, to counting and
tallying, to distributing those

00:09:26.699-->00:09:31.704
unofficial uh- uh- vote results
on election night to the final
uh- to the final tally. And what

00:09:33.940-->00:09:37.944
we did through this very
comprehensive risk assessment is
we found that it’s actually

00:09:37.944-->00:09:42.949
really really difficult to try
to uh- manipulate the actual
vote count itself. And- and

00:09:46.052-->00:09:51.124
there’s a lot of reasons for
that. The voting machines are
physically secured, there, um-

00:09:51.124-->00:09:55.195
we’ve got you know thousands of
jurisdictions around the country
that all use different sorts of

00:09:55.195-->00:09:59.699
things and so while you may be
able to get into uh- some voting
machines, and I know a lot of

00:09:59.699-->00:10:05.038
you may be working in the um
voting village. Um- you can’t
really affect that at scale

00:10:05.038-->00:10:10.076
without detection and uh- and it
would be really hard. So we
said, ‘okay, what are they

00:10:10.076-->00:10:15.281
trying to do?’ They’re trying to
undermine our democratic process
and the confidence that we have

00:10:15.281-->00:10:19.385
in our democratic process. And
there are a lot of ways to do
that without actually trying to

00:10:19.385-->00:10:24.624
manipulate the vote. And that’s
what we expect that they will
continue to do. So, um- what we

00:10:24.624-->00:10:30.129
look at is- and this is how we
define election infrastructure.
There’s uh- a lot of other

00:10:30.129-->00:10:34.567
efforts about thinking about
social media companies and the
role that they play uh- in

00:10:34.567-->00:10:40.673
campaigns. But what we’re very
much focused on is the state and
local run process that you and I

00:10:40.673-->00:10:47.380
uh- all participate in, I hope,
uh- all the time. And um- and so
this is what we’re focused on

00:10:47.380-->00:10:53.620
securing. And- and again to take
an example, voter registration,
it’s not so much the data

00:10:53.620-->00:10:57.557
itself. It’s actually fairly
easy to get the data. In most
states you can buy the data. So

00:10:57.557-->00:11:02.095
it’s not that we’re worried
about losing the data. What
we’re worried about is maybe

00:11:02.095-->00:11:08.167
manipulation of the data. So um-
so somebody comes to vote. Now
everyone can get a provisional

00:11:08.167-->00:11:13.306
ballot in every single uh- in
every single jurisdiction in
their country, but say a bunch

00:11:13.306-->00:11:19.312
of people show up, and uh- and
you’re- you’re told well you’re
not supposed to vote here, um-

00:11:19.312-->00:11:22.715
but we’ll give you a provisional
ballot. And then the lines start
to back up, and then a lot of

00:11:22.715-->00:11:26.286
people say ‘something must be
wrong here, there’s a lot of
people not on this list, they’re

00:11:26.286-->00:11:32.559
on the wrong list.’ And um- so
the- the data itself has just
been man- either manipulated or-

00:11:32.559-->00:11:36.496
or lost or something like that.
So that’s what we’re concerned
about so we’ve talked a lot

00:11:36.496-->00:11:41.534
about how we um- can secure
those voter registration
processes. In the actual

00:11:41.534-->00:11:45.738
tallying of the votes, thinking
about the systems that run the
voting machines; election

00:11:45.738-->00:11:51.444
management systems, the tallying
process, all of those. Making
sure that those are secure and

00:11:51.444-->00:11:55.615
uh- and and many of those, I
will say, State and local
communities that run elections,

00:11:55.615-->00:12:00.353
they are not the most resourced
organizations in this country.
And now it’s not a surprise to

00:12:00.353-->00:12:04.390
you. So they’re often dealing
with old software, old
technologies and they do the

00:12:04.390-->00:12:09.028
best that they can, but how can
we help them as a community,
again, this is all of us in this

00:12:09.028-->00:12:13.700
room, how can we help them
ensure that those- those systems
are secure, that they understand

00:12:13.700-->00:12:20.473
best practices, that they know
how to prioritize what they need
to be doing. And then, finally,

00:12:20.473-->00:12:26.212
thinking about say uh- the
submission on election night.
This was um- an interesting

00:12:26.212-->00:12:32.685
concept right. That these are
not the official election
results, but um- say a bunch of

00:12:32.685-->00:12:38.758
states issued- you know- here’s
who won the- the presidential
election, our unofficial tally.

00:12:38.758-->00:12:43.396
And then a couple of weeks later
an official tally comes out.
It’s completely different. So,

00:12:43.396-->00:12:48.501
the official tally is correct,
but the unofficial one was
manipulated. Now you have

00:12:48.501-->00:12:54.707
another situation where the uh-
the confidence in the process
has been undermined. So, so I

00:12:54.707-->00:13:00.747
want to put this out to you.
This is a public document, um-
you can um- you can get it

00:13:00.747-->00:13:05.818
online, uh- on our website. But
I wanted you all to think about
bigger than just the voting

00:13:05.818-->00:13:10.623
machines themselves. This is a
bigger process, there’s more to
think about, there’s more um

00:13:10.623-->00:13:15.962
work to do with the private
sector. The vendors of these
systems, who are working with

00:13:15.962-->00:13:19.732
the state and local, secretaries
of state, the election
directors, helping them

00:13:19.732-->00:13:24.737
understand how we work together
on this. So, I- I just- I wanted
to close before I- I bring up

00:13:27.106-->00:13:33.079
one my folks here, who is
running a lot of this activity
for us. With uh, you know,

00:13:33.079-->00:13:38.084
really thinking about kinda
where we started. The uh- the
election issue has brought the

00:13:40.520-->00:13:46.526
concept of cybersecurity to the
fore in a way that nothing else
had. I- I like- I yearn for the

00:13:46.526-->00:13:52.932
days when we were just worried
about the electric grid going
down. And- uh- in- so as uh- as

00:13:52.932-->00:13:57.937
frustrating as- as [laughter]
that may be for us talking about
it, it has had the power of

00:14:00.039-->00:14:05.478
getting people involved in this
space and thinking about these
questions about the role of

00:14:05.478-->00:14:09.582
government, the role of the
private sector, the role of the
researchers, the role of the

00:14:09.582-->00:14:14.821
international community, when we
start to think that we have had-
we have adversaries that are

00:14:14.821-->00:14:19.559
trying to undermine our
traditional concepts within our
country; our concepts of

00:14:19.559-->00:14:24.430
democracy, our concepts of
intellectual property, our
concepts of privacy, our

00:14:24.430-->00:14:30.870
concepts of our ability to do
business and to run our
government. And, if we don’t

00:14:30.870-->00:14:36.809
come together and again we
don’t- aren’t able to get passed
our traditional cultures, our

00:14:36.809-->00:14:43.349
traditional incentives, and
figure out how do we come and
collectively defend against

00:14:43.349-->00:14:48.855
these adversaries, they’re going
to turn the internet into the
model that best suits their

00:14:48.855-->00:14:53.960
concepts, which is not free
expression, which does not
protect intellectual property,

00:14:53.960-->00:14:59.999
which does not allow the level
of um- discourse and progress
that we have made in our

00:14:59.999-->00:15:05.471
country. So it’s not just an
American issue, it is definitely
a global issue. And uh- and

00:15:05.471-->00:15:09.942
while elections are just one
part of it, we still have to
think about all of the rest. I

00:15:09.942-->00:15:14.781
encourage you as you- as you all
are thinking about the
technology itself, and how do we

00:15:14.781-->00:15:19.318
make the technology better,
think about the policy side of
it and participate in that

00:15:19.318-->00:15:24.423
debate. We need more people who
understand the actual technology
to participate in the policy

00:15:24.423-->00:15:29.428
debate. Shockers, not everybody
knows how the internet works in
D.C. So, um with that, I wanted

00:15:32.365-->00:15:36.969
to just um- close, I would like
to um- we were in the voting
village last year, um- not

00:15:36.969-->00:15:43.676
everybody knew, but we’ve got
our team of um- pen testers and
red teamers here, that um- They

00:15:43.676-->00:15:48.781
are the ones doing all of these
vulnerability assessments across
the country. They do it for

00:15:48.781-->00:15:52.785
critical infrastructure. Um-
We’ve gone to Ukraine, we’ve
been everywhere. Rob, come on

00:15:52.785-->00:15:57.990
up. And um, I just wanted to
introduce him to you, um- they
are all proudly wearing- I think

00:15:57.990-->00:16:02.495
that they’re all proudly wearing
DHS shirts. Um- uh- some of them
are pretty obvious that they’re

00:16:02.495-->00:16:09.368
government officials, but uh-
[laughter] um, but um we want to
make sure that you get a chance

00:16:09.368-->00:16:14.073
to talk with them, and like I
said importantly, that you
engage in both the technology

00:16:14.073-->00:16:20.112
and the policy side. Because we
can’t just be having this debate
in D.C. so uh- Rob? [applause]

00:16:20.112-->00:16:25.117
>>Yeah, thank you so, yeah,
there’s about twenty of them
down here and they’re some of

00:16:28.654-->00:16:33.659
the brightest and- and smartest
people that I’ve- I’ve worked
with um- so please make sure you

00:16:36.762-->00:16:41.901
find them out. What I’d like to
reiterate though, is we- we do
have a national mission and

00:16:41.901-->00:16:46.505
elections is one part of that.
So, under the assessments
program, uh we have three

00:16:46.505-->00:16:49.976
different programs, we have
cyber hygiene which is basically
vulnerability scanning, we have

00:16:49.976-->00:16:54.213
risk and vulnerability
assessment which is pen testing,
then we have operation assurance

00:16:54.213-->00:16:59.952
uh- which is more of a blue team
kind of style look. Under cyber
hygiene, we have 850 customers

00:16:59.952-->00:17:05.291
under there, of which 95 are
election related. And so what’s
great about this is we’re able

00:17:05.291-->00:17:09.695
to get this data, and analyze
this data and look at it and say
‘hey we see trends here.’ So we

00:17:09.695-->00:17:13.566
saw trends in the federal
government um- where critical
vulnerabilities weren’t being

00:17:13.566-->00:17:17.737
closed, and we- we worked with
that. We issued some um binding
operational directives that take

00:17:17.737-->00:17:23.709
care of that. Um- the statistics
that we’re seeing on elections
are right in line with our- our

00:17:23.709-->00:17:27.914
other customers. So they-
they’re no better, they’re no
worse than the other customers.

00:17:27.914-->00:17:31.951
Um, they have the same issues
and the main issues are that
we’re seeing old software out on

00:17:31.951-->00:17:37.790
the internet, unsupported
software, PHP that is outdated.
um- It’s the same issue. Um- One

00:17:37.790-->00:17:42.595
one thing that we are able to
see in a little of our analysis
is that the election officials

00:17:42.595-->00:17:48.634
are- are a little slower than-
than um- the government and
other people on on fixing and

00:17:48.634-->00:17:52.171
patching those issues. So we’re
going to work with them, and get
the word out, and let them know

00:17:52.171-->00:17:56.842
how critical it is and,
hopefully they’ll be able to get
the resources to um work- work

00:17:56.842-->00:18:02.381
and fix that so it it it’s a-
it’s a resource issue again,
right? So, um, on the uh-

00:18:02.381-->00:18:07.486
penetration testing side, it’s
the same issues. When these guys
uh- start their campaign, the

00:18:07.486-->00:18:12.525
first thing that they do, they
do a little uh- background
investigation and they send a

00:18:12.525-->00:18:17.930
phishing email. Bingo, they’re
in. So, they’re in election uh-
places and they’re in

00:18:17.930-->00:18:22.435
non-election places; financial,
water uh- it it it’s the same.
So we’re working on educating

00:18:22.435-->00:18:26.606
people and educating people and
getting- getting the word out
there. And the final thing I

00:18:26.606-->00:18:31.477
want to say before we wrap this
up is uh- we just started uh- a
pod vulnerability assessment

00:18:31.477-->00:18:35.181
where we’re getting election
machines in and other critical
infrastructure machines in.

00:18:35.181-->00:18:38.284
We’re take- tearing apart the
firmware, we’re looking at that,
and we’re working with the

00:18:38.284-->00:18:43.889
vendors. Gonna issue some
guidance to them and find issues
on those, and hopefully we’ll

00:18:43.889-->00:18:48.627
make this more secure so, um
we’re here to help, and um- make
sure you see these guys, they’re

00:18:48.627-->00:18:53.633
a lot of good guys Thank you-
>>and girls >>and- and ladies,
yes [laughter] [applause]

00:18:57.570-->00:19:02.508
>>Okay, so with, again, please
find us. We- we’d like- We’d
love if you’d work for us, but

00:19:05.811-->00:19:10.349
if you’re not willing to work
for us, um we’d love you to work
with us, like I said, we’re the

00:19:10.349-->00:19:15.554
only part of the government that
has a purely defensive mission,
and as you can see, it’s a- it’s

00:19:15.554-->00:19:20.559
a big one! And uh- we’re just so
happy that you’re here. That you
choose to came to listen to us

00:19:23.996-->00:19:30.970
talk, and that you’re willing to
invest your time, and your
talent in solving these really

00:19:30.970-->00:19:33.572
critical problems so, thank you.
[Applause]
