00:00:00.334-->00:00:04.671
>>Howdy everybody! Um thank you
for showing up. Uh I know you’re
all pretty hungover and that

00:00:04.671-->00:00:10.410
you’ve managed to survive a
couple days of Vegas. Uh and
that this is, you know Saturday.

00:00:10.410-->00:00:15.716
Um to start off before we get
into the actual subject like
actually talking about um using

00:00:15.716-->00:00:21.421
ads and what not. Don’t fire or
sue me, the basic crap. Be
responsible adults. Uh who am I?

00:00:21.421-->00:00:26.426
Does it really matter? Eh. Um
so. [audience laughs] [applause]
Alright uh let’s dive in. So a

00:00:33.800-->00:00:38.839
couple caveats um first off so
I’m operating under the
assumption that the target

00:00:38.839-->00:00:43.043
whoever I'm trying to detect is
going to be searching for the
term. So that they are actually

00:00:43.043-->00:00:47.014
going to a search engine and
they will, sorry, I’m not gonna
wobble, um that they're gonna go

00:00:47.014-->00:00:51.785
into a search engine and they’re
gonna search for it. Um second,
I’m picking one particular ad

00:00:51.785-->00:00:55.856
network. In this case I’m
picking um Google because Google
indexes very quickly, I have a

00:00:55.856-->00:00:59.927
very short attention span, it
plays out very nicely. Um so
they’re gonna use that ad

00:00:59.927-->00:01:04.464
network. Um and then the ad will
actually register it as
displayed to the target, so some

00:01:04.464-->00:01:08.802
ad blockers are going to block
even the display of an ad to
somebody even registering on the

00:01:08.802-->00:01:14.408
back-end. Versus others will
still appear to have that
impression given. So uh

00:01:14.408-->00:01:17.411
operating under the assumption
that the ad blocker doesn't
block the display from

00:01:17.411-->00:01:22.950
registering. So spherical cows
in a vacuum. Back story. So you
know you’re- you’re a red team

00:01:22.950-->00:01:27.955
operator and your op is your
baby. Uh you’ve been really
clever-cl-clever; you’ve put in

00:01:27.955-->00:01:33.527
tons and tons of effort; you
feel like you’ve exploited you
know the humans very well, you

00:01:33.527-->00:01:36.530
feel like you’ve written
beautiful code. Maybe you're
doing something really clever in

00:01:36.530-->00:01:41.234
terms of how you're gonna get
root in production and all of
the sudden your implant gets umm

00:01:41.234-->00:01:47.240
discovered. What are you gonna
do? You’re not gonna cry. So the
criteria for this were it had to

00:01:47.240-->00:01:51.411
be indirect, so the notion that
this had to be really easy
something that we could do just

00:01:51.411-->00:01:55.649
to spin up as part of the op. It
had to be passive. We didn't
want to actively go and like

00:01:55.649-->00:01:59.186
cheat and go look at where the
blue team was coming from and
use any of that information so

00:01:59.186-->00:02:03.824
apply it to any potential blue
team effort. And of course low
effort. Going back to general

00:02:03.824-->00:02:09.496
laziness and short attention
span. Um so what is that worth
to all of us? To me it's worth a

00:02:09.496-->00:02:14.568
lot but at a certain point I
draw the line. So this is where
the line is drawn. Let’s catch

00:02:14.568-->00:02:20.907
lazy blue teamers. Um this also
stems from the idea of
previously you used to be able

00:02:20.907-->00:02:24.811
to upload like everybody was
like “Oh I found this weird hash
I’m gonna upload the file to

00:02:24.811-->00:02:29.216
Virustotal.” And then all of the
adversaries all of the red teams
were like “Hey so we’re not

00:02:29.216-->00:02:32.719
going to upload the actual
implant, we’re gonna wait for
someone else to upload it.” And

00:02:32.719-->00:02:36.156
then you had adversaries that
were able to go then search for
their hash they knew what the

00:02:36.156-->00:02:39.926
hash was, they wait for it to
show up and appear in Virustotal
and that means that somebody

00:02:39.926-->00:02:43.330
found it and somebody uploaded
it. Biggest problem with that of
course is like you knew that

00:02:43.330-->00:02:47.000
they found it, you didn’t know
what they were going to do. So
just but just having that fact

00:02:47.000-->00:02:50.971
is enough time to transition
your infrastructure over so,
whatever your latest

00:02:50.971-->00:02:54.708
infrastructure is, move it, it
saves you time, saves you money,
and again, you don’t have to do

00:02:54.708-->00:03:01.481
the op from scratch again. Um
and this is the fun part. Blue
teams are burnt out. So

00:03:01.481-->00:03:05.152
[chuckles]. Uh the average SOC
analyst really doesn’t do
something important nowadays.

00:03:05.152-->00:03:08.555
It’s, they’re looking at false
positive, false positive, and
then oh look it’s a phishing

00:03:08.555-->00:03:12.926
email, somebody downloaded some
commodity s**t. So what we’re
gonna try and do here is attack

00:03:12.926-->00:03:18.098
the human when they find
something interesting. And we’re
gonna look at the general life

00:03:18.098-->00:03:22.669
cycle here, so. The SOC analyst
is like, they’re, they’re gonna
get the alert, something's gonna

00:03:22.669-->00:03:27.274
happen. It’s gonna be “hey weird
file” maybe it's a reverse shell
going somewhere strange like oh

00:03:27.274-->00:03:31.511
what is this. Because they’re
bored, this is what I’m banking
on, because they’re bored

00:03:31.511-->00:03:35.215
they’re going to actually dive
into this with a little bit more
depth than what is traditional.

00:03:35.215-->00:03:41.421
So the alerts the alert won’t
tell them it’s bad, it’s just
gonna be like “something strange

00:03:41.421-->00:03:44.424
happened.” So as part of that
investigation they’re going to
do more of that investigation

00:03:44.424-->00:03:48.161
then they normally would, which
is where they’re gonna start
making mistakes. So um target

00:03:48.161-->00:03:52.232
the human we all know everybody
has internal tools. You have
your internal sandbox you have

00:03:52.232-->00:03:56.036
all of your internal indicator
databases, you have all your
vendor products. You’re paying

00:03:56.036-->00:04:01.241
some cyber TM vendor to tell you
everything is bad. Um but then
eventually you end up going to

00:04:01.241-->00:04:04.911
public tools. So you take the
hash you throw it into Google
and you’re like great! What does

00:04:04.911-->00:04:08.215
hybrid analysis say? Did anybody
write a blog about this? Is
anyone else talking about this

00:04:08.215-->00:04:12.385
hash? And you need that
information to kind of, you know
like, you wanna write your

00:04:12.385-->00:04:16.022
report, when you send it up to
the highest tier you're like
“Hey I’m amazing, I found out

00:04:16.022-->00:04:20.460
that this is really in fact not
China it’s actually Russia
pretending to be China.” And you

00:04:20.460-->00:04:26.566
found that on blog on Kaspersky.
Um so [laughter] sorry I love
all of them I’m not being bitter

00:04:26.566-->00:04:32.339
or mean. Uh [laughs] So it’s
it’s really you’re you’re just
attacking that human desire, you

00:04:32.339-->00:04:36.009
know someone who’s really bored
someone who’s diving into that
investigation. They want to feel

00:04:36.009-->00:04:40.280
special they want to be able to
send all the information up to
the next tier analyst or to the

00:04:40.280-->00:04:43.783
the sophisticated reaches and be
like “Hey I did all this work
already I found all this.” And

00:04:43.783-->00:04:48.755
if it’s not in any of their
tools they’re going to have to
rely on public sources. Cool. So

00:04:48.755-->00:04:52.592
next up. Um what if I know when
somebody searches for something?
Right? This is pretty basic

00:04:52.592-->00:04:56.062
like, this is- this is the
advertising goals um.
Advertising is all about

00:04:56.062-->00:05:00.000
targeting someone based on how
they’re using the service, based
on what they’re searching for,

00:05:00.000-->00:05:04.471
based on what they want. So it
gives us the power to dive into
key words, we can do demographic

00:05:04.471-->00:05:08.008
information, we can also say
“Hey I know that there are gonna
be you know hackers there are

00:05:08.008-->00:05:11.978
gonna be interests in security.”
So you can even target it down a
lot further. That’s literally by

00:05:11.978-->00:05:17.450
design. But the really cool part
here about advertising um which
is something that we as the

00:05:17.450-->00:05:22.322
general public don’t see very
often is all the tools on the
backend to help companies and

00:05:22.322-->00:05:27.994
individuals fine tune their
advertising. So this is the, the
basic idea here. So highlighted

00:05:27.994-->00:05:32.599
in the red square is in Google
this is the impression. So the
impression is going to appear

00:05:32.599-->00:05:38.405
every time a particular ad is
shown to someone. Um it goes
back to the- the caveat about um

00:05:38.405-->00:05:42.576
it has to actually register as
an impression for this to work.
So what we’re gonna be looking

00:05:42.576-->00:05:46.880
for here is like, when that
impression is shown that means
someone searched for it. And if

00:05:46.880-->00:05:51.117
you choose the exact um string
matches like yes someone had to
have searched for it for that

00:05:51.117-->00:05:55.622
impression to happen. Um and of
course over on the right if
somebody chooses to search for

00:05:55.622-->00:06:01.428
your adword while they’re logged
into um their Google account,
you get a ton of really scary

00:06:01.428-->00:06:04.064
information. So if you really
wanted to have some fun
afterwards if you got this to

00:06:04.064-->00:06:08.535
work you can really target them
almost directly because you
don't- if you’re a red teamer

00:06:08.535-->00:06:12.038
and you’re looking at which
particular target, you probably
know whose on their sys or you

00:06:12.038-->00:06:18.511
probably know who’s gonna be
running this op anyways. Cool so
fun part. Is it possible? Um

00:06:18.511-->00:06:23.917
obviously yes more caveats. So
this is something that was a
huge pain in the a*s which is um

00:06:23.917-->00:06:27.988
there are advertising
limitations. It really makes
sense, so thinking about it from

00:06:27.988-->00:06:32.759
Google’s perspective, to take
out an ad where there needs to
be um search volume. There have

00:06:32.759-->00:06:36.129
to be people searching for it
before you can take out that
adword. Now a bunch of you

00:06:36.129-->00:06:41.635
people in the audience who are
ethically ambiguous pretty easy
to bypass that 1 uh but that is

00:06:41.635-->00:06:45.372
still 1 limitation that some
people will not be able to
bypass to use this technique. Uh

00:06:45.372-->00:06:50.877
and um lastly there needs to be
search results. So if you’re
going to throw the uh, a hash in

00:06:50.877-->00:06:54.447
there, there needs to be blogs
coming back. And that’s really
uh it just needs to be indexed

00:06:54.447-->00:06:58.785
by Google in this case. Easy to
do, you can throw it in comment
fields, you can spin up a a

00:06:58.785-->00:07:02.355
Google site, you can write your
own blog and host it on
Wordpress. Anything you want

00:07:02.355-->00:07:07.360
just to get it indexed so that
there are search results when
someone searches for it. Um and

00:07:07.360-->00:07:11.865
of course there’s the OpSec
considerations. So to actually
sign up for adwords you have to

00:07:11.865-->00:07:16.636
enter in all of this easily
spoofable information, um and on
top of that then the pages have

00:07:16.636-->00:07:20.440
to be indexed which is actually
a-a huge consideration going
back to the initial point of we

00:07:20.440-->00:07:24.711
wanted this to be really low
effort. We wanted it to be
passive and indirect. So if you

00:07:24.711-->00:07:29.783
have to expose yourself
additionally by creating all of
these blogs, um again you’re

00:07:29.783-->00:07:32.852
going up against someone who
you’re assuming is bored and
would dive into all of those

00:07:32.852-->00:07:36.389
blogs that you write. So every
blog that you write just to
generate that search result to

00:07:36.389-->00:07:42.329
get it indexed is going to
result in potentially more
exposure to uh whoever is

00:07:42.329-->00:07:46.333
looking for you. So they’re
gonna, they’re gonna maybe be
able to dig. So you’re just

00:07:46.333-->00:07:50.403
gonna- you have to be really
careful if you do that. Cool.
Let’s do it. So um 1 type of ad

00:07:50.403-->00:07:54.708
I kind of talked about briefly
but uh Google has a bunch of
really awesome ad types if you

00:07:54.708-->00:07:58.778
want to do a keyword search on a
Google search so you can do
broad, you can do phrase, and

00:07:58.778-->00:08:03.917
you can do exact. Uh for this
we’re doing a very simple we’re
doing exact match on a hash, but

00:08:03.917-->00:08:09.189
you can also do display and
video ads. So you can target
people all across the entire

00:08:09.189-->00:08:14.127
spectrum if you wanted to get
really really uh picky if you
wanted to work with probably

00:08:14.127-->00:08:19.799
someone who’s a marketing major
or focuses in uh advertising. Um
and then for the big strategy on

00:08:19.799-->00:08:23.970
this like, for those of you who
don’t know um how Google adwords
work you actually have to bid to

00:08:23.970-->00:08:28.475
get your ad displayed um and
your bid is based on how much
you’re willing to pay per click.

00:08:28.475-->00:08:32.879
For this technique it's super
easy to get your ad displayed
because theoretically no one

00:08:32.879-->00:08:36.349
else should be taking out an
adword for your hash because
you’re the only one who knows it

00:08:36.349-->00:08:42.288
exists. So you can bid you know
5 cents whatever it is uh it's
no big deal. Um other

00:08:42.288-->00:08:46.426
possibilities. So this is the
really fun part is I’m using
hashes because hashes are easy I

00:08:46.426-->00:08:51.197
can guarantee that’s unique but
you can use all sorts of other
uh references. So if you wanted

00:08:51.197-->00:08:56.102
to attack uh and see if someone
was actually reversing your
malware, you can take your

00:08:56.102-->00:08:59.939
handle and take out an adword
for it. No one else should be
googling for your handle unless

00:08:59.939-->00:09:03.209
they found it in, you know, you
stick it in the strings of the
file. So someone read the

00:09:03.209-->00:09:07.781
strings on your implant and
that’s how they’re looking for
your handle. It gives you, like,

00:09:07.781-->00:09:11.751
the value of knowing that
someone is reversing your
malware. The value of knowing

00:09:11.751-->00:09:15.288
that exact that like they ran
strings on my file or they’ve
decompiled it and they’re

00:09:15.288-->00:09:21.394
actually uh doing something
mean. I- that value is priceless
for a lot of people depending

00:09:21.394-->00:09:26.399
upon your target. Uh same goes,
like you can do email address.
Have a really unique file name.

00:09:26.399-->00:09:30.637
And then you know uh a bunch of
random misc- miscellaneous
phrases so like pick your

00:09:30.637-->00:09:34.974
favorite battle from Lord of the
RIngs or something really really
obscure from literature, throw

00:09:34.974-->00:09:38.945
that in as a reference in your
file and see if people are
googling for it. Um the 1

00:09:38.945-->00:09:42.816
problem though with this is if
you’re trying to, it’s like,
what the goal of the campaign

00:09:42.816-->00:09:47.086
is. So if you’re trying to catch
that someone is reversing your
file, these options are really

00:09:47.086-->00:09:51.224
good. Um however if you just
want to see if “Hey someone
found my file and they may be

00:09:51.224-->00:09:54.294
spinning up an investigation
they may be going after my
infrastructure.” You want to

00:09:54.294-->00:10:00.066
keep it as simple as possible.
So really um my recommendation
is to keep it with a file hash.

00:10:00.066-->00:10:02.936
Everybody is gonna take an mb5.
They’re gonna take the mb5 or
the shovel and they’re gonna

00:10:02.936-->00:10:07.173
throw it into Google. Um not a
guarantee but it's more likely
that they’re gonna do that then

00:10:07.173-->00:10:10.810
actually reverse your file and
dig in find your email address
find your handle find all of

00:10:10.810-->00:10:16.382
those things. So keep it unique,
k- keep it simple, is my
recommendation. Um I made this

00:10:16.382-->00:10:20.920
mistake as part of this, is
don’t ever use common terms,
don’t try and put in complex

00:10:20.920-->00:10:27.093
id-ideas, and also um the last
part is uh domains and IPs. So
almost everybody on a blue team

00:10:27.093-->00:10:32.432
is going to be using some other
tool that will be able to dig
into domains and IPs better than

00:10:32.432-->00:10:36.202
throwing it into Google. Uh so
that's just something to be
aware of. If you really want

00:10:36.202-->00:10:39.706
like you’re trying to get really
high fidelity results and you’re
trying to get it so that if

00:10:39.706-->00:10:45.311
somebody searches for it, uh
you’re gonna get that alert that
they did. Cool so for this

00:10:45.311-->00:10:49.816
example, because I love lawyers,
and lawyers love me, uh I’m not
going to be doing it for a

00:10:49.816-->00:10:53.653
custom file, I’m going to be
doing it for uh just some
ransomware that is already

00:10:53.653-->00:10:57.857
generating a lot of traffic. So
already past that ethically
ambiguous point, um the

00:10:57.857-->00:11:01.294
traffic’s already been generated
and this is kind of you know
something interesting I learned

00:11:01.294-->00:11:06.232
is all of the AV companies take
out ads. They do the exact same
thing. So if Google were to

00:11:06.232-->00:11:10.069
combat this technique, uh
they’re gonna say “great you
can’t take out ads for hashes.”

00:11:10.069-->00:11:15.742
But all of the AVs are already
taking out ads for hashes after
something hits. So um it’s- it's

00:11:15.742-->00:11:21.247
really gonna be a hard game to
combat something like this. Um
so uh the ad that I did was just

00:11:21.247-->00:11:25.151
a- a really huge bid so I was
bidding like 5 dollars per click
so it got displayed all the

00:11:25.151-->00:11:30.657
time. And then um I was the- the
campaign was a maximize click.
So I’m trying to drive all that

00:11:30.657-->00:11:36.563
revenue um by driving people to
my site. Um so, here it is. It
actually works it's a miracle.

00:11:36.563-->00:11:41.568
So uh up at the top all I did
was uh my ad is a simple Google
site. And I said, so Google also

00:11:44.003-->00:11:47.540
looks at ads very carefully
because they've been dealing
with a lot of malware in ads. So

00:11:47.540-->00:11:51.544
what you’re trying to do is
you’re trying to demonstrate
that the ad you’ve created is

00:11:51.544-->00:11:55.281
gonna be relevant for the
particular ar- audience that
you’re targeting. So in this

00:11:55.281-->00:12:00.887
case I pretend to be a- a
malware blog about uh weird file
hashes and it’s just a Google

00:12:00.887-->00:12:05.992
site. Uh it shows up when
someone searches for it. It’s
awesome. But this is what the um

00:12:05.992-->00:12:11.831
SOC analyst or someone on the
blue team would see. Uh this is
what you would see. So this is

00:12:11.831-->00:12:17.270
where the- the actual valuable
information is. Obviously uh
Google has these fancy colors

00:12:17.270-->00:12:20.840
and pretty graphs that you know
if you actually wanted to login
and use your mouse you could

00:12:20.840-->00:12:27.680
see. But um it also has this uh
beautiful API. So you can grab
the report you can just set up a

00:12:27.680-->00:12:31.084
pipe on script. It pulls down
the report every hour. And all
you’re looking for is that

00:12:31.084-->00:12:34.721
column right there that column
is gonna change from 0 to 1.
When it does you can

00:12:34.721-->00:12:39.392
automatically switch your
infrastructure over. So um it
works really nicely to just

00:12:39.392-->00:12:44.163
automate a way the having to
deal with uh like blue team
recon actually coming after you.

00:12:44.163-->00:12:49.569
Um and then there is 1 other
annoying caveat with Google is
that it’s um, adwords so it’s

00:12:49.569-->00:12:54.240
designed for marketing people.
It’s not gonna be a real time
alert. It’s um they claim in

00:12:54.240-->00:12:58.177
their documentation it’s 3
hours. Um during my testing it
wasn’t ever that long but at the

00:12:58.177-->00:13:02.348
same time it’s not gonna be a
real time alert. So someone’s
not gonna search for it 1 minute

00:13:02.348-->00:13:05.184
and then 5 minutes later you’re
gonna see it. It’s gonna be
probably a couple of hours and

00:13:05.184-->00:13:10.623
then- then that’s how you know
that someone's been searching
for it. Um but it works um but

00:13:10.623-->00:13:17.030
there’s a ton of practical
considerations to take into
account. So if you’re you’re

00:13:17.030-->00:13:22.835
you’re a team of 1 is it really
worth going into all of this
effort to target a blue team

00:13:22.835-->00:13:27.173
that you already know is
overworked, uh completely
underwater, and bored out of

00:13:27.173-->00:13:31.911
their mind? Um really the most
applicable use case of this is
someone who can spend millions

00:13:31.911-->00:13:36.849
of dollars, someone who has a
staff of several thousand that
can go out and generate that

00:13:36.849-->00:13:42.055
traffic for you in advance. And
also someone who’s going to be
burning an 0day. So if you’re

00:13:42.055-->00:13:46.325
burning an 0day, it’s really
really important that you know
that you’ve been detected. Like

00:13:46.325-->00:13:49.062
that all of the sudden becomes
really valuable. If you’re just
you know, if you’ve sent out a

00:13:49.062-->00:13:52.098
phishing email, and it’s like
it’s just generic like your
running empire or something like

00:13:52.098-->00:13:57.170
that. That being burned, like
it’s a pain to set up again and-
and spin up from scratch, but

00:13:57.170-->00:14:00.473
it’s not gonna be, it’s not
gonna be the death of an entire
op. It’s not gonna be actually,

00:14:00.473-->00:14:06.179
have any serious implications.
But if you’re dropping like 3 to
4 0days and you end up with that

00:14:06.179-->00:14:09.682
getting burned, then all of the
sudden it’s like oh great we've
lost millions of dollars or

00:14:09.682-->00:14:13.319
however much time it took to
find those 0days so having any
kind of visibility into how

00:14:13.319-->00:14:17.557
quickly you’ve been found out is
amazing. Um and of course OpSec.
I’ve touched on this before but

00:14:17.557-->00:14:22.829
I can't emphasize this enough is
like uh you have to expose quite
a bit of information to whoever

00:14:22.829-->00:14:26.699
is researching it but also then
to Google. So if you're not
careful about how you're

00:14:26.699-->00:14:31.104
registering this if you’re a
very sophisticated actor and
you’re taking out uh an ad so

00:14:31.104-->00:14:35.575
like you spin up a campaign you
take out only 1 ad for 1
particular hash, Google can dive

00:14:35.575-->00:14:39.612
into that data and say “Hey, you
took out 1 ad for 1 particular
thing, that’s really

00:14:39.612-->00:14:42.615
suspicious.” And even after like
eventually you’re gonna get
discovered everything's gonna

00:14:42.615-->00:14:46.252
get publicized. Google can go
back and say “Alright great! I
know all this information” They

00:14:46.252-->00:14:50.490
can see all of your logins they
can see every time you ran the
API and pulled down that report,

00:14:50.490-->00:14:54.594
so you’re really exposing a lot
of OpSec and it’s definitely
something you need to take into

00:14:54.594-->00:14:57.897
consideration if you’re gonna be
a sophisticated actor and if
you’re really like, if you

00:14:57.897-->00:15:04.270
really wanna use this in the
wild. Um but this is- this is
really the exciting part for me

00:15:04.270-->00:15:10.543
is um is the next steps. So
keyword matching on a Google
search is probably gonna be

00:15:10.543-->00:15:15.681
phased out within uh the next 12
months just based on how quickly
they continue to change the ad

00:15:15.681-->00:15:19.752
tech. Just between when I
submitted this talk in April and
when I’m presenting today,

00:15:19.752-->00:15:24.457
Google has changed their
back-end algorithm at least 3
times that I’ve noticed and it’s

00:15:24.457-->00:15:29.128
ridiculously annoying because
there’s no way to understand how
the false negatives are going to

00:15:29.128-->00:15:33.966
change. So with this technique
if someone searches for the hash
and they get the ad displayed to

00:15:33.966-->00:15:39.405
them it's pretty much a
guarantee that you know that uh
they found your hash. But what

00:15:39.405-->00:15:43.676
you don’t know is if someone
doesn’t- if someone searches for
the hash and the ad doesn't

00:15:43.676-->00:15:48.881
display. Uh there are plenty of
times when Google and you just
tweak that algorithm a little

00:15:48.881-->00:15:51.784
bit and you’re like great so
we’re not gonna show that ad to
the first 50 people that search

00:15:51.784-->00:15:55.321
for that term. And they’ll never
tell you. So you don’t know when
the ad is not being shown. So

00:15:55.321-->00:15:58.457
there’s no guarantee that it
will actually work in every
single case, it’s just all that

00:15:58.457-->00:16:02.528
you know is that if someone
searches for it and the ad is uh
shown to them then it will

00:16:02.528-->00:16:06.365
actually be uh useful and
valuable to you. Um but of
course there’s also the

00:16:06.365-->00:16:12.138
extension of this into email.
And that’s the really exciting
part. So um all of the blue team

00:16:12.138-->00:16:15.474
communities they have their
secret scroll groups that are
basic distribution lists.

00:16:15.474-->00:16:20.680
Everybody is using a 3rd party
email provider and if one of
those 3rd party email providers

00:16:20.680-->00:16:25.218
is not as sophisticated as
Google, so Google no longer lets
you like uh look at the email

00:16:25.218-->00:16:29.822
bodies. So if someone is not
that sophisticated um I’m not
gonna rat out any companies

00:16:29.822-->00:16:33.359
here, but um, there’s a- there’s
a couple of them out there that
will allow you to take out an ad

00:16:33.359-->00:16:38.030
for a keyword match on a body.
Doing the same thing with hashes
on the email keyword match in a

00:16:38.030-->00:16:43.469
body would allow you to know if
someone is talking about your
file in a closed group. That’s

00:16:43.469-->00:16:48.507
arguably much more useful to you
because that means that someone
who isn't like most of us try

00:16:48.507-->00:16:53.713
not to put things into Google,
but we will share suspicious
files, suspicious IPs in closed

00:16:53.713-->00:16:58.284
communities that we perceive to
be safe. So this is a really
good indicator for people who

00:16:58.284-->00:17:00.853
think that they’re more
sophisticated and they could be
spinning up a working group

00:17:00.853-->00:17:04.924
against you, great. You know
it’s great early warning to move
your infrastructure. Um and of

00:17:04.924-->00:17:09.762
course there’s always going to
be 3rd party apps. So of course
we all read about Google who is

00:17:09.762-->00:17:14.367
uh that was still allowing
developers to read email. You
can always just go ask all the

00:17:14.367-->00:17:18.304
people on the thread and tell
the team that you’re uh target
to install a third party uh

00:17:18.304-->00:17:21.807
plugin and they'll do it.
Probably one of them will. And
you can read all of their

00:17:21.807-->00:17:26.812
emails. Um and of course why do
you care? Um I think we all know
why we care is that advertising

00:17:29.715-->00:17:35.521
is everywhere. Um we actually
should pay attention to how our
data is being stored but also we

00:17:35.521-->00:17:41.260
should think about how we can
use it. Um the barrier to entry
into online marketing and

00:17:41.260-->00:17:46.332
advertising is continually
getting lower. Um this entire
presentation could have been

00:17:46.332-->00:17:51.070
done simply just by clicking
buttons and and reading online
documentation. There was no

00:17:51.070-->00:17:57.610
actual technical barrier to use
advertising for the benefit of
the community and for the

00:17:57.610-->00:18:01.981
benefit of security. So um
that’s- that's what's pretty
awesome about how- how the ad

00:18:01.981-->00:18:06.986
world- adword eh brr bleh-
advertising world is changing.
Like uh we get to do, we get to

00:18:12.591-->00:18:17.596
take advantage of big companies
trying to make money. And let’s
use it to our advantage. Thank

00:18:22.835-->00:18:25.237
you very much. [applause]
