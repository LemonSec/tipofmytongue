00:00:00.667-->00:00:07.107
>> Hey, um, thank you all for
coming. Um My name is Yawnbox, I
co-founded, ah, Emerald Onion,

00:00:07.107-->00:00:12.112
um, we’re a 501(c)3 transit ISP.
We currently route a whole bunch
of Tor exit traffic Ah, based in

00:00:17.718-->00:00:22.723
Seattle Washington. [Speaker
clears throat] Um, three years
ago, um I started, ah this idea.

00:00:26.927-->00:00:33.333
I started um, sharing this idea
with some friends of mine in the
privacy community, that the

00:00:33.333-->00:00:38.338
current way of building up the
Tor network might not be ideal
for our th-the version of the

00:00:42.175-->00:00:46.480
internet that we want and that
might be to Torify everything,
ah, to push everything through

00:00:46.480-->00:00:51.485
Tor whatever, ah . I think that,
ah, Brave ah, is testing, ah um,
using Tor in the private browser

00:00:58.358-->00:01:03.297
mode, um, that’s awesome. Um,
facebook has their Onion that’s
awesome, um DuckDuckGo, ah, all

00:01:06.566-->00:01:12.406
of the ah, media organisations
that use SecureDrop um, that’s
great, um but if we want more,

00:01:12.406-->00:01:17.411
um providers using Onion
services to protect their, ah,
users privacy, then I think, ah,

00:01:20.013-->00:01:24.618
we need to go about building our
Tor infrastructure and privacy
infrastructure, ah, a little bit

00:01:24.618-->00:01:29.623
better. So, a year ago, um, me
and some friends, ah co-ah-co-
founded Emerald Onion, um, we

00:01:32.993-->00:01:39.967
registered in Seattle, in
Washington State Um, and ah,
we’ve been online for a short,

00:01:39.967-->00:01:45.872
ah, little over a year now. Um,
most of the content in, in my
slide deck is, or details of the

00:01:45.872-->00:01:50.410
content, is on our website
emerald onion dot org. Um, cause
I don’t have enough time to go

00:01:50.410-->00:01:55.415
through all of the detail
[Speaker laughs] in this talk.
So, um, starting up, we ah, did

00:01:59.586-->00:02:05.525
the Washington non-profit ah,
status, um, for a few dollars.
Ah, the articles and

00:02:05.525-->00:02:10.197
incorporation that we did, were,
are compliant, are compliant
with, ah, the IRS 501(c)(3)

00:02:10.197-->00:02:16.570
requirements, um, it’s there on
that website there emerald onion
dot org forward slash articles,

00:02:16.570-->00:02:21.575
um, so I should step back
actually real quick. So, one of
the overall um, purposes of

00:02:23.877-->00:02:30.484
Emerald Onion, is to, like, try
all of this stuff, make it work
and then publish, ah, what we do

00:02:30.484-->00:02:35.455
on our website. So, like the
articles, um, like all the other
stuff in-in this, ah,

00:02:35.455-->00:02:42.029
presentation they’re gonna be
online, so that you all can, ah
easily, ah, approach, ah,

00:02:42.029-->00:02:47.034
these-these problems. So um,
step two for us was registering
with Arin, ah, to get our ASN

00:02:50.037-->00:02:55.042
and our IPv6 and IPv4 scopes.
So, Arin, if you don’t know is,
um like a domain registrar,

00:02:58.145-->00:03:02.049
except instead of going for,
there for domains, you go there
for IP’s. There’s an application

00:03:02.049-->00:03:08.655
process, ah, you, um have an ASN
that you use to talk to other
ASNs if you're using, ah,

00:03:08.655-->00:03:13.660
protocols like BGP, which we,
which we do. And, ah, this
process, ah took a little, a

00:03:18.465-->00:03:24.171
little less than a month. Um,
The, ah, [Speaker makes noise]
um, application, ah process that

00:03:24.171-->00:03:29.176
we went through is also
published on our website, um, so
that you can, ah, more easily,

00:03:32.112-->00:03:37.117
ah do that. So, um, this is our
ASN, um, we have a slash 36 IPv6
scope, ah, we have a slash 24

00:03:41.922-->00:03:48.762
IPv4 scope, um, AS-ah, we, we
use our ASN, again to
communicate with other ASNs that

00:03:48.762-->00:03:53.767
we peer with in the Seattle
internet exchange, um, [Speaker
clears throat] This is hard,

00:04:15.088-->00:04:18.992
[Speaker laughs] [audience
applause] Thanks. Oh So, yeah,
ASNs, they’re cool. So, um,

00:04:18.992-->00:04:25.132
[audience laughter] use your ASN
to announce to other ASNs, um,
yeah, we use BGP, um. So, one

00:04:25.132-->00:04:30.036
really cool thing that we found
out, um, someone randomly told
us on twitter, which was pretty

00:04:30.036-->00:04:35.041
cool. So, um, IPv4, um, scopes
are exhausted in a few years
ago. Um, Arin, um, actually has

00:04:38.612-->00:04:43.617
this 4 Dot Ten policy, um, which
was ,ah, set aside to facilitate
the adoption of IPv6. Um, so if

00:04:48.522-->00:04:52.826
you can articulate to Arin and
apply, go through that process,
they’ll actually give you a free

00:04:52.826-->00:04:57.831
slash 24, ah IPv4 scope, and so
that’s what we did. Um, we were
able to articulate this because

00:05:00.534-->00:05:05.539
Tor in its current state, um,
only supports IPv4 traffic. IPv4
traffic between, ah relays, so

00:05:08.341-->00:05:14.548
from middle to, or from guard to
middle, from middle to exit,
that’s all IPv4 only. Um, Tor

00:05:14.548-->00:05:21.288
project wants to expand and, and
do more IPv6, but we need more
operators to use IPv6 in order

00:05:21.288-->00:05:27.894
to, ah, curtail potential
surveillance issues around ah,
having a limited, ah, subset of,

00:05:27.894-->00:05:32.899
um our, ah, nodes, um, being, ah
IPv4 only. [Speaker sniffs] Um,
so please, ah, add, if you're an

00:05:36.803-->00:05:42.409
operator, please support IPv6,
because we need it and hopefully
one day we’ll be able to only

00:05:42.409-->00:05:47.414
use IPv6 and we can get rid of
our-our IPv4 scopes. Um, So, ah,
because our, long term goal was

00:05:51.284-->00:05:56.289
to get 501(c)(3) status as a
public charity, ah, Sorry,
that’s a little early. Um, so

00:06:00.560-->00:06:04.164
the IRS EIN, so this is
basically you're social security
number for your organisation,

00:06:04.164-->00:06:09.169
it’s a quick easy thing that you
do online. Um, 501(c)(3) so we,
ah, wanted to become a public

00:06:11.338-->00:06:16.343
charity, so that we could be
sustainable in our funding Um,
it’s easy, ah, if you do it

00:06:19.846-->00:06:23.316
right. Like, this was one of the
biggest hurdles that we had
mentally, like going into this

00:06:23.316-->00:06:27.787
we had no idea how long it was
going to take, if it was going
to be possible. We were being

00:06:27.787-->00:06:32.392
coached by Riseup networks and
Calyx Institute and other
not-for profits, and it just

00:06:32.392-->00:06:37.030
seemed like this might be an
impossible task, in this current
day and age for a-a tech

00:06:37.030-->00:06:42.035
organisation to get 501(c)(3)
charity status, um, it was
actually real easy. Um, so, um,

00:06:45.739-->00:06:51.811
The trick that we learned, is
that, ah, don’t make 50 000
dollars in your, um, operating

00:06:51.811-->00:06:57.250
budget, like for your first
year. Um, and that qualifies you
for the 1023-EZ, the 1023 is

00:06:57.250-->00:07:03.156
what you would use to apply for
a 501(c)(3) status, ah, through
the IRS. Um, and make sure you

00:07:03.156-->00:07:08.161
do that, um, within the first
year roughly, um, so do that.
Um, so the 1023-EZ, ah, n-not

00:07:10.297-->00:07:17.170
only made it, ah, cheap, it was
275 dollars compared to, I think
the normal 1023 process is, like

00:07:17.170-->00:07:22.175
850 dollars. Ah, we didn’t need
a CPA, we didn’t need a lawyer,
ah, and if, you can see by these

00:07:24.344-->00:07:29.015
dates here, like, it was, it was
like six- sixteen days. I mean,
for some reason the IRS didn’t

00:07:29.015-->00:07:35.588
actually tell us that we got
charity status, we had to look
it up manually online,um, so

00:07:35.588-->00:07:40.593
cool, but we got it. So, um,
Part of our articles of
incorporation, ah, this is

00:07:45.765-->00:07:50.770
article four, um, one of our
goals as a organisation that
wants to support privacy, was to

00:07:53.106-->00:07:58.244
try and make sure that our scope
was general, um, so the purpose
of this corporation is to

00:07:58.244-->00:08:03.216
promote and support online
[Speaker stutters] anonymity and
privacy. Ah, we wanted to keep

00:08:03.216-->00:08:08.455
it very general, so that in the
event that Tor is, you know, the
hot stuff right now, maybe mixed

00:08:08.455-->00:08:14.361
nuts, maybe whatever is gonna
be, um, what we need to build
out in the future. Um, and

00:08:14.361-->00:08:18.832
there’s a whole bunch of other
stuff that we could potentially
do as a 501(c)(3) charity, so we

00:08:18.832-->00:08:23.837
wanted a, a general mission
statement. [Speaker sniffs] Um,
another small, ah, thing in the

00:08:28.375-->00:08:33.913
1023 process, ah, this is how
you, ah, signify through the IRS
what kind of an organisation

00:08:33.913-->00:08:40.553
that you are. Ah, there’s a huge
list of NTEE codes, um, we spent
a couple of weeks, like , going

00:08:40.553-->00:08:44.124
through all of them and deciding
which one we wanted to go with.
Um, but we felt like this was

00:08:44.124-->00:08:49.129
the best one, given our, um,
presumed scope for operating as
a transit ISP. Um, so as you can

00:08:54.567-->00:08:59.572
see here, um, this was the
timeline and how much it costs
to like, legitimately become a

00:09:04.043-->00:09:10.917
501(c)(3), 501(c)(3) transit
ISP. Ah, if we had known that
the IRS process was gonna be so

00:09:10.917-->00:09:15.922
easy, we’d have done that, ah,
sooner and we probably could’ve
done it by July. Um, but, yeah,

00:09:18.057-->00:09:23.430
so, like bottom line it’s, this
is something that you can do,
this is not that hard. We didn’t

00:09:23.430-->00:09:28.268
need a CPA, we didn’t need a
lawyer, we had them anyway,
because we were fortunate in our

00:09:28.268-->00:09:33.506
network of friends and family,
um, supported us. But it's
actually not needed, if, if you,

00:09:33.506-->00:09:38.511
if you do these things in the
right way. So, ah, we turned on
our exit relays in July, um, of

00:09:44.451-->00:09:49.456
2017. Um, we actually made a
small mistake that, um, I wanna
touch on real quick. Um, we

00:09:51.891-->00:09:58.264
originally first leased our IP
space from our upstream ISP. Ah,
we should have just run as a

00:09:58.264-->00:10:04.304
middle relay until we got our
own IP scopes. Um, so there was
one day when our ISP, ah,

00:10:04.304-->00:10:08.675
e-mailed us and said, hey, we’re
getting abuse, ah, we’re gonna
start charging you a dollar an

00:10:08.675-->00:10:15.148
abuse complaint, if you ah, if,
if you don’t stop. So, that
would’ve been kind of expensive

00:10:15.148-->00:10:20.253
and, ah, thankfully the, um,
Arin had already approved our IP
scopes, so-so we were, um, in

00:10:20.253-->00:10:25.124
transition already to use our
own scopes. Um, but it’s just a
lot easier starting out, if you

00:10:25.124-->00:10:29.195
start as a middle relay and then
once you get your own IP scopes,
go towards, ah, you can start

00:10:29.195-->00:10:34.200
exiting. So in this,ah, year
process , we, ah, transit 3
point 5, ah, pebibytes of data

00:10:37.337-->00:10:42.976
and we received, ah, r-roughly
3100, um, unique abuse
complaints. Um, 99 percent of

00:10:42.976-->00:10:49.549
these abuse complaints were
automated, um, we noticed, but
they came in none the less. Um,

00:10:49.549-->00:10:54.120
most of them also don’t require
any kind of response, but we
responded anyway, just to be

00:10:54.120-->00:10:59.526
proactive, just in case
something were to escalate. Um,
and we, we use, ah, Zendesk to

00:10:59.526-->00:11:03.963
automated that, um automated
response back and we serve our
legal FAQ, which I will be

00:11:03.963-->00:11:09.636
talking about shortly. Um, to
educate them about what we do
and why we’re doing it. So if,

00:11:09.636-->00:11:15.909
ah, basic math here, ah, which I
think is pretty cool, um, for
every 1 point 2 terabyte, no

00:11:15.909-->00:11:21.414
sorry 1 point 13 terabytes, ah,
we receive an abuse complaint.
And that’s a unique abuse

00:11:21.414-->00:11:26.185
complaint and it could be
anything from spam, because,
we-we run as an unfiltered exit

00:11:26.185-->00:11:31.624
router, so we don’t block any
ports. Um, could be spam, could
be SSH attacking, I don’t know,

00:11:31.624-->00:11:35.762
like there’s just a bunch of
random stuff. We used to get a
bunch of DMCA, but that stopped

00:11:35.762-->00:11:41.768
randomly. Um [Speaker sniffs]
So, ah, Emerald Onion, ah,
preemptively develops, um, a

00:11:41.768-->00:11:46.773
strongly go backbone right at
the beginning, ah we reached out
to, um, M-Marsha Hoffman at

00:11:49.475-->00:11:54.480
Zeitgeist Law, um, to help us
create ah, some legal FAQs. Um,
that are also on our website

00:11:56.950-->00:12:01.888
site for free. Um, Im so please,
check them out and use them if
you're a-a operating like we are

00:12:01.888-->00:12:05.825
in the United States, cause
they’re not really valid
anywhere else. Ah, we have two

00:12:05.825-->00:12:12.265
versions of the legal FAQ, ah,
one of them you would give to
your ISP, if your ISP receives

00:12:12.265-->00:12:18.605
an abuse complaint, you can give
them this FA-FA-FAQ and um, it
would be valid in explaining,

00:12:18.605-->00:12:23.610
like, what you're doing is
legal. Um, And then, we have
another legal FAQ, which is if

00:12:26.279-->00:12:30.550
you would receive abuse from
anyone, so that is the one that
we use for automated responding

00:12:30.550-->00:12:35.555
now that we have our own IP
space. Um, So, um, one small
thing we ah, we just note

00:12:42.762-->00:12:48.134
publicly that, ah, we don’t log
any information. Um, Tor does a
good job of this already, but

00:12:48.134-->00:12:54.474
we, um audit our um, devices to
make sure that we don’t log any
network information, um, above

00:12:54.474-->00:13:01.214
and beyond what Tor already
doesn’t record. So, the extent
of what we, I guess technically

00:13:01.214-->00:13:06.219
have, is like DNS cache, um, and
BGP ah, caches, but none of
those are super sensitive, um,

00:13:09.489-->00:13:14.494
thankfully. So, this is, ah,
this is our policy that we state
on our website.. Um, there’s

00:13:16.796-->00:13:21.801
Yeah. So, DMCA is interesting
it’s stupid, but it’s here, um,
basically, ah, in order to be

00:13:25.405-->00:13:32.078
compliant, ah, with the, ah
DMCA, ah safe harbour-r. The
DMCA protections have a conduit

00:13:32.078-->00:13:38.951
provider, um, you need to have a
termination policy. Ah, this is
our termination policy,um, here.

00:13:38.951-->00:13:43.956
Um, it basically says, ah, we
don’t have any subscribers, we
can’t identify our users, but in

00:13:47.660-->00:13:51.831
appropriate circumstances we’ll,
ah terminate. Um, we don’t
really have a technical way to

00:13:51.831-->00:13:57.537
do that because of Tor, but we
have to have this policy just to
be compliant with the DMCA, ah,

00:13:57.537-->00:14:02.475
protections, so cool. Okay, so,
um, also in the past year we
received two subpoenas, um this

00:14:07.013-->00:14:13.352
is just one example, um, both of
them were from the, ah,
Department of Homeland Security.

00:14:13.352-->00:14:18.357
Um, we published a transparency
report here at this, ah, on our
website and, ah, there’s a whole

00:14:21.728-->00:14:27.300
bunch of other things beyond
subpoenas that we list just to
be explicit. Um, so we update

00:14:27.300-->00:14:31.304
that regularly. Ah, this was
pretty scary for us to receive
the first time, like, we kinda

00:14:31.304-->00:14:35.808
expected that something might
eventually happen, just talking
to Calex and other operators.

00:14:35.808-->00:14:41.948
Um, these came in via email,
they don’t come in via mail,
that surprised us. Um, so they

00:14:41.948-->00:14:48.888
send it to our admin ad-address,
ah, it-it was really scary at
first, but it-it doesn’t seem

00:14:48.888-->00:14:54.594
that way, ah now just because
we’ve had a little bit of
practice. Um, so basically like,

00:14:54.594-->00:14:58.698
some takeaways, don’t run an
exit router from your home
obviously. Tor project does a

00:14:58.698-->00:15:03.736
good job, ah educating people
about this. Um, the reason why
you don’t want that, is because

00:15:03.736-->00:15:10.009
you don’t wanna be at the you
don’t want law enforcement to
come and kick in your door and

00:15:10.009-->00:15:14.280
take your computer's just
because, um, someone did
something, presumably malicious

00:15:14.280-->00:15:20.820
from your exit router.So put it
in a data center and ah, ideally
own your own IP scopes, ah like

00:15:20.820-->00:15:25.825
you own, s-ah, V6 and V4 address
scopes. Um, and that way you
can, instead of being at the

00:15:28.961-->00:15:31.998
part of law enforcement where
they come and kick down your
door and take your stuff. Ah,

00:15:31.998-->00:15:37.069
they come, they-they send you an
email and they’re civil and like
okay and we have this IP

00:15:37.069-->00:15:39.071
address, ah, we need some user
data and we can just literally
just reply and say hey we’re

00:15:39.071-->00:15:41.073
running Tor, ah, we don’t have
data, here’s your legal FAQ. Ah,
please let us know if, if we-we

00:15:41.073-->00:15:43.075
can help further. Um, again, a
lawyer isn’t needed for this
process, um, at first we did

00:15:43.075-->00:15:48.080
have a general council call and
just talk to them, just to
understand this process. But, ah

00:16:05.364-->00:16:09.135
it’s actually to the point where
we’re just gonna email them back
now if they send us another one

00:16:09.135-->00:16:15.708
and just say, hey, we can’t
help, sorry. Um, so today we’re
launching a new program, ah,

00:16:15.708-->00:16:20.146
it’s called Onion dot Lawyer.
Um, something that's been
missing in the Tor community for

00:16:20.146-->00:16:25.151
awhile, is clear legal support.
Ah, so, our general counsel Matt
McCoy is, ah, leading this and

00:16:28.221-->00:16:33.726
in partnership with the Yale
Privacy Lab. Ah, it’s a
distribution that you can

00:16:33.726-->00:16:40.566
contact in the event that you
are under legal duress, because
of your operations with Tor. Um,

00:16:40.566-->00:16:46.305
it’s a network of pro-bono
attorneys that um, will do their
best to support you in the event

00:16:46.305-->00:16:52.111
that you need help. Um, if they
can’t, hopefully their networks
can find someone that can, um,

00:16:52.111-->00:16:57.116
but hopefully this is something
that becomes important in
supporting, ah, operators. Um,

00:17:03.656-->00:17:09.762
oh, yes if you're an attorney,
ah please reach out and um,
volunteer for this. If you have

00:17:09.762-->00:17:12.365
a friend that’s an attorney,
please convince them that this
is something that they might

00:17:12.365-->00:17:18.304
want to do and have them reach
out, ah so that we can grow
this. [Speaker sniffs] Okay ,so

00:17:18.304-->00:17:22.909
data centre stuff. So to move in
we had to have three types of
insurance, this is the three

00:17:22.909-->00:17:29.081
types. Ah, we bought our own
hardware, ah we used low power Z
on D platform that has

00:17:29.081-->00:17:34.086
integrated 10 gigabit, ah fibre,
so it’s nice and ah, cool and
has good connectivity. Um, we,

00:17:37.723-->00:17:42.662
because the Tor network is
roughly 90 percent Debian, ah,
we, decided to go with a BSD

00:17:42.662-->00:17:45.932
platform. We decided to go with
hardened BSD, because of
its,inherent, ah, exploit

00:17:45.932-->00:17:50.069
mitigations and general
security, which we think also
improves the health of the Tor

00:17:50.069-->00:17:56.208
network. Um, this is an
outstanding project if you are
into BSD, please support them,

00:17:56.208-->00:18:00.746
ah, if you're an operator,
please consider using hardened
BSD or something that isn’t

00:18:00.746-->00:18:05.751
Debian, that’d be cool. Um, Yeah
[ Speaker sniffs] Okay, so this
is our current call location and

00:18:12.158-->00:18:17.296
our costs, nothing special about
it. We have a gigabit, um,
unmetered link, um this

00:18:17.296-->00:18:21.834
particular link is actually part
of our, um, internet exchange
point connectivity, so we

00:18:21.834-->00:18:26.872
transit through that connection,
so we only have one ten gigabit
fibre drop, which is cool. And

00:18:26.872-->00:18:30.743
then,um, we have connectivity
with the Seattle Internet
Exchange, which I will talk more

00:18:30.743-->00:18:37.316
about here. So, um, internet
exchange points are really
cool,ah, they provide, ah direct

00:18:37.316-->00:18:43.356
access to a whole bunch of peers
and what, what I mean by peer
is, someone that you physically

00:18:43.356-->00:18:48.928
connect to. And this is really
important for Tor exit
operating, because instead of

00:18:48.928-->00:18:51.464
you, that Tor exit traffic. Say
you're facilitating the Tor
traffic from a middle relay to

00:18:51.464-->00:18:56.602
your exit and then its going out
to the internet, ah from that
exit. Ah, it is ideal, I think

00:18:56.602-->00:18:58.604
in that, that traffic that
you're exiting to its final
destination has as little hops

00:18:58.604-->00:19:00.539
as possible. And what I mean by
a hop, is some other router or
switch on the internet, that is

00:19:00.539-->00:19:05.544
owned by some unknown company
and every one that it traverses
is an opportunity for

00:19:11.384-->00:19:16.389
surveillance in some form or
fashion. Ah, so peering, is
really awesome I think for, ah

00:19:22.828-->00:19:26.766
the Tor network, not just
because of latency minimisation.
Like, I think our average, ah

00:19:26.766-->00:19:31.771
latency to our peers in the six
is point 3-5 milliseconds, so
it's really quick. Um, so that

00:19:35.474-->00:19:39.879
also helps, ah, ex-user
experience kind of. Ah, but
mainly it’s, it’s the

00:19:39.879-->00:19:43.883
surv-surveillance
min-minimisation properties of
IXPs that we think that is

00:19:43.883-->00:19:47.119
really valuable. So, as you can
see here, we appear here
directly with Google, with

00:19:47.119-->00:19:54.026
Amazon, with Akamai, OpenDNS,
twitter, so if people are using
our exit relays, they’re gonna,

00:19:54.026-->00:20:00.633
um, terminate at those endpoints
very quickly and with no other
third parties observing that

00:20:00.633-->00:20:06.906
traffic, hopefully. Aside from
like the route servers that we
connect to in the IXP. Um,

00:20:06.906-->00:20:11.911
hoping that they’re not
backdoored and I’ll talk more
about that. Um, So, um, we are,

00:20:15.514-->00:20:20.519
we - jumping into this like we
were kinda fortunate with the
Seattle Internet Exchange, it’s

00:20:22.955-->00:20:27.960
a non-profit IXP, um, it’s
[Speaker stutters] it’s, it
advises that you don’t surveil

00:20:30.930-->00:20:35.534
the ports if you're a peer, um,
which is good. Um, I’m hoping
that they eventually one day

00:20:35.534-->00:20:41.040
adopt a transparency report,
that would be better. Um,
nonprofits have inherent

00:20:41.040-->00:20:44.677
transparency aspects to them,
like publishing where they get
their money, what they spend it

00:20:44.677-->00:20:49.281
on, stuff like that. So, finding
non-profit IXPs, I think is
really awesome. Ah,

00:20:49.281-->00:20:54.286
geo-location, so, um, that could
mean, ah, it’s proximity to,
like an undersea cable. It could

00:20:59.558-->00:21:06.298
mean, ah, it’s, ah proximity to
a certain provider, it could,
ah, there's like a hundred and

00:21:06.298-->00:21:11.670
,um, I think twenty about IXPs
in the United States. Ah, so
there’s quite a selection and

00:21:11.670-->00:21:17.743
m-most of them are, um in dense
areas to begin with, so there’s
not a lot of choice. But there’s

00:21:17.743-->00:21:22.248
some strategic things that you
can, um, some strategic choices
that you can make. So

00:21:22.248-->00:21:28.420
participation, ah, this could be
like, ah, a certain provider
like Amazon, ah like CloudFlare,

00:21:28.420-->00:21:34.793
Akamai, like big providers. Ah,
places that traffic [speaker
stutters] ah, will go on the

00:21:34.793-->00:21:39.798
internet. Um, the-the more the
better, ah, so that there’s more
peers, ah, that you exit-exiting

00:21:43.736-->00:21:48.707
traffic to. And then of course,
costs, ah, most of the IXPs, ah,
that we’ve seen are for profit

00:21:48.707-->00:21:54.580
and pretty expensive. Our’s, we
paid 2000 dollars for a 10 Gig
port, ah, it’s a one time cost,

00:21:54.580-->00:22:01.320
there’s no recurring fees, which
is awesome, ah, so, not many are
like that. [Speaker sniffs] Um,

00:22:01.320-->00:22:06.692
this was a recent article, um,
about the biggest, one of the
biggest IXPs in the world and

00:22:06.692-->00:22:13.299
wh-a-ah, it’s in Germany, which
is unfortunate, because a lot of
the Tor network is in Germany.

00:22:13.299-->00:22:18.304
Like, just because of their, how
cheap their brandwidth is, um,
it’s not clear how good or,

00:22:20.372-->00:22:25.878
obviously not good. How bad this
might be for the Tor network,
um, personally I would try to

00:22:25.878-->00:22:31.617
avoid DE-CIX, just because of
this known issue of active
government surveillance. Um,

00:22:31.617-->00:22:36.622
also part of Five Eyes, um so
it-it’s best to,ah avoid that if
possible. Um, so challenges for

00:22:41.627-->00:22:47.132
finding good IXPs, um, obviously
if they’re under active
surveillance that’s not ideal.

00:22:47.132-->00:22:51.403
Um, there’s lots of data centres
without IXPs, like I said
there’s a 120 roughly in the

00:22:51.403-->00:22:56.408
United States. Ah, there, um,
large IXPs so Comcast, ah AT&T
whatever um, because they’re

00:23:01.046-->00:23:05.217
profit driven, they tend to have
restrictive peering policies,
which means they’re not open to

00:23:05.217-->00:23:10.222
peering with anyone. They’re
only going to,ah, charge money,
um, which is not good for,ah, I

00:23:14.293-->00:23:19.164
think surveillance. Um, or I
should say privacy. And then
content providers with no

00:23:19.164-->00:23:25.904
peering policies, so ah, some
providers just re-refuse to
peer, because it doesn’t make

00:23:25.904-->00:23:29.942
sense. Um, which is also
unfortunate, because that means
we can’t, it means we have to

00:23:29.942-->00:23:34.280
send traffic around in some
other way and it’s going through
some other provider, that we

00:23:34.280-->00:23:39.885
just have no accountability for.
That there’s no accountability
for. Okay, so under sea cables,

00:23:39.885-->00:23:44.890
so we know that these are, we-we
have a good, guess, that these
are all tapped. Um, which is

00:23:49.461-->00:23:56.268
lame, um, The way that the Tor,
ah, bandwidth authority is
currently work means that the,

00:23:56.268-->00:24:01.106
the Tor traffic largely, um,
bounces back and forth between,
West, ah, Western Europe and

00:24:01.106-->00:24:05.544
Eastern United States. So
there’s a whole lot of traffic
that crosses the Atlantic ocean.

00:24:05.544-->00:24:10.549
Um, This, um, We-we have a
working theory where, um there
could be some more strategic

00:24:16.322-->00:24:21.360
decisions made in order to
place, ah, Tor routers,
especially exit routers. Um, one

00:24:21.360-->00:24:25.631
of them is to place them in
IXPs, because of the early
termination and the properties

00:24:25.631-->00:24:31.036
there. Another, is because, or
if- if they can be placed close
to under sea cables, so again,

00:24:31.036-->00:24:36.075
so if it can receive that
traffic as soon as it comes into
the US, ah, and it can terminate

00:24:36.075-->00:24:42.147
as quickly as it can without
going anywhere else in the US,
that I think is better. So, we,

00:24:42.147-->00:24:48.420
um, are just developing this
theory, or we’re trying to find,
ah, things that can help us

00:24:48.420-->00:24:53.425
m-more strategically place exit
routers around the US. Ah,
today, we’re also launching this

00:24:57.663-->00:25:03.268
project called Safe Crossing.
Ah, the first part of this is
just ex, us ex-ah, Emerald Onion

00:25:03.268-->00:25:07.740
expanding into other places in
the US. Ah, we think we’re gonna
go somewhere along the east

00:25:07.740-->00:25:13.579
coast, um, because of the, um,
things that I've just discussed.
Um, but more importantly Safe

00:25:13.579-->00:25:20.486
Crossing is going to be research
and development around the
deployment of net new IXPs. Ah,

00:25:20.486-->00:25:25.491
so because of our experience
with not being able to find
non-profit affordable,ah,

00:25:27.593-->00:25:31.296
[Inaudible] IXPs of the
qualities that I already talked
about. Ah, we want to build our

00:25:31.296-->00:25:36.301
own, so, ah, where there is
dense connectivity, um, we’re
looking there. Um, there’s some

00:25:40.172-->00:25:46.145
underserved areas that we think
that IXPs could be built, ah,
places, ah, like Puerto Rico, we

00:25:46.145-->00:25:52.885
think would be a really great
starting point for something
like this. Um, But it’s

00:25:52.885-->00:25:58.490
basically to compete with, ah,
the profit driven IXPs that are
also generally surveillance

00:25:58.490-->00:26:02.261
friendly. So, it’s about
creating safer spaces on the
internet, ah, like basically

00:26:02.261-->00:26:07.800
kinda the backbone of the
internet. Um, this kind of a
cheap way to do that. Um, create

00:26:07.800-->00:26:12.805
safe spaces for traffic to, um,
move about. Um, if you are
interested in helping create,

00:26:17.676-->00:26:22.114
um, non-profit IXPs and being
involved with Safe Crossing,
please contact us here. Um,

00:26:22.114-->00:26:26.218
particularly if you're involved
with like the open compute
projects or interested in that

00:26:26.218-->00:26:32.624
platform, because, ah, it’s open
hardware, ah, free delivery
software. Um, it goes up to 100

00:26:32.624-->00:26:37.463
Gigabit, um, it just seems like
an ideal platform that creates
a, a safe space for ah, your

00:26:37.463-->00:26:42.468
compute infrastructure. If you
have any IXP management
experience, we are interested in

00:26:42.468-->00:26:48.173
learning more about how to
actually build one. Um, we'll
figure it out. Um, if you have

00:26:48.173-->00:26:53.712
IP scopes or are working for a
company that has IP scopes, ah,
that you’re not using, ah like

00:26:53.712-->00:26:59.418
IPv4 scopes. Um, consider
donating them to us, um, cause
we will either use them or we’ll

00:26:59.418-->00:27:04.356
give them to an organisation
like us, that is able to, to use
them for privacy. Um, and we’re

00:27:06.592-->00:27:11.597
looking for partners, so if we
can create, um, I, one IXP
somewhere, um we wanna have like

00:27:14.366-->00:27:21.106
big partners on day one. So that
it ah, entices other people to
become part of this new, um,

00:27:21.106-->00:27:26.111
mission. And, ah, grow, grow the
infrastructure in that region,
ah, cause the more peers the

00:27:28.180-->00:27:33.185
better. So, ah, this is our ah,
just some quick details about
our income. Ah, we, to get

00:27:41.527-->00:27:46.498
started we received a grant from
Tor service dot net, ah for 5000
dollars. Our directors have been

00:27:46.498-->00:27:51.503
donating monthly, um, currently
up to the sum of about 10 000
dollars. Ah, we’ve received

00:27:51.503-->00:27:56.041
about a 1000 dollars of direct
funding and ah, DuckDuckGo
included us in their privacy

00:27:56.041-->00:28:01.380
challenge, this pa - couple of
months ago. Um, and we received
enough money to s-ah pay for our

00:28:01.380-->00:28:06.251
whole year of operations for
this next year,which is awesome.
Um, in the, the PayPal giving

00:28:06.251-->00:28:10.155
campaign, um, someone signed us
up for that and they just sent
us a random cheque, which was

00:28:10.155-->00:28:14.226
cool. Um, but that’s like the
benefit of like being a
501(c)(3) ah, charity, is you

00:28:14.226-->00:28:18.897
can take advantage of some of
these programs. Another one that
I didn’t mention here, that we

00:28:18.897-->00:28:23.902
haven’t really used yet, is, ah,
um, if your company ah price er,
matches donations that you make

00:28:25.971-->00:28:30.375
to non-profits. Um, because
we’re in those networks as well
[Speaker counting] which is

00:28:30.375-->00:28:35.380
cool, um challenges. So,ah,
fees, obviously money, it costs
money to do this stuff. Um, IP

00:28:38.150-->00:28:45.157
transit, that’s our ISP, ASN
fees, IPv-IP scope fees.
Transport is where you have to

00:28:45.157-->00:28:49.461
lay like fibre from point to
point within the data center, so
that has a recurring cost

00:28:49.461-->00:28:54.833
sometimes. Um, call location
fees, equipment fees, peering
port fees, so these are all

00:28:54.833-->00:28:59.538
challenges that we have. Um,
we’re trying to figure out ways
that we can make these, ah,

00:28:59.538-->00:29:05.777
cheap or free and share that
information with the larger
community. Ah, Generally, it’s

00:29:05.777-->00:29:10.782
hard to prioritise privacy over
anything else. Um, like it’s
really cool to work for Emerald

00:29:14.453-->00:29:19.458
Onion and - and like, think
about privacy first. Ah, not
logging, ah, using disk

00:29:21.660-->00:29:26.665
encryption, whatever, um, But
it, it makes it hard, because we
can’t, we can’t log. So, when

00:29:30.168-->00:29:34.106
someone dosses us, we actually
have no idea who does it,
because we don’t - we don’t log

00:29:34.106-->00:29:39.811
the perimeter firewall, just in
case, ah, some Tor user ends up
hitting our firewall in some

00:29:39.811-->00:29:44.716
weird way and causes us to log
the traffic. We just don’t want
the IPs. So, making those kinds

00:29:44.716-->00:29:49.554
of choices makes it hard to
operate in that way, ah, but
that’s what we think is

00:29:49.554-->00:29:55.827
important. So we prioritise
privacy, ah, over money. Um,
open source networking hardware,

00:29:55.827-->00:29:57.829
so, there is more and more open
hardware showing up, but
specifically networking hardware

00:29:57.829-->00:29:59.831
is unique. Ah, both Firmware and
like Fullstat Compute is-is, is
challenging. There’s some

00:29:59.831-->00:30:01.833
options out there, out there,
like I mentioned the open
compute project. But there needs

00:30:01.833-->00:30:06.838
to more, ah, we can always use
more. Ah, network redundancies,
so one thing that we want to do

00:30:18.817-->00:30:23.822
better, ah is having redundancy
in our WAN and LAN stacks, but
if we want redundancy there,

00:30:26.525-->00:30:31.029
we’re going to be multiplying
our costs by at least a factor
of two. Just because we have to

00:30:31.029-->00:30:35.767
have at least two of everything,
but that usually comes with
other additional costs as well.

00:30:35.767-->00:30:40.772
So, we, we want to, ah, have
that, but again that’s, that’s a
big challenge. Um, IPv4 scopes,

00:30:43.842-->00:30:49.281
ah, obviously because of the
exhaustion issue, um, it creates
a higher bar for someone jumping

00:30:49.281-->00:30:53.452
into this, to get started. If
they could just jump in with
only an IPv6 scope, that would

00:30:53.452-->00:30:58.890
be easier. Um, and of course
technical volunteers, is hard to
find people and keep people that

00:30:58.890-->00:31:03.895
are passionate about this stuff.
Um, so it’s always a, a
challenge. Um, so I wanted to

00:31:03.895-->00:31:09.234
give a quick shout out to Tor
projects for hiring ah, their,
their relay advocate, um,

00:31:09.234-->00:31:14.239
Colon,ah, aka Fool, is ah, their
advocate. Um, he, if you're an
operator he probably has already

00:31:16.308-->00:31:22.681
reached out to you, if you have
updated contact information in
your Torrent C-file. So, um, if

00:31:22.681-->00:31:27.385
you need help, ah, directly
something you can’t get from
the, the email lists, ah, you

00:31:27.385-->00:31:32.390
can reach out to Colin and he
can help you out. Um, lastly I
want to thank, ah, my team so, I

00:31:35.827-->00:31:41.066
have a really amazing team of
volunteers. Ah, on the, the
board of directors and our

00:31:41.066-->00:31:47.539
advisory board, um, it, it, we
just wouldn’t be here without
[Speaker laughs] the help of

00:31:47.539-->00:31:52.544
everyone. So, um, Yeah, um,
thanks [Speaker laughs] That’s
I’m all done. [Audience

00:31:59.484-->00:32:00.452
applause]
