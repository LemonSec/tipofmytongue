00:00:00.067-->00:00:05.072
>>Alright now I’ll hand it over
to the reverse engineering team.
>>Woo >>Thank you. DefCon 26.

00:00:09.409-->00:00:14.414
Thank you. [applause] Okay, my
name is John Torrani and I am
the producer and editor of the

00:00:18.619-->00:00:23.657
project that we’re presenting
reverse engineering. Um I’ve
been working in entertainment

00:00:23.657-->00:00:29.997
for the past 15 years with a
specialty in unscripted content.
Um, we’re gonna tell you about a

00:00:29.997-->00:00:35.002
great project that we’ve been
working on. A project about you.
And we’re gonna tell you how you

00:00:37.004-->00:00:42.009
can get involved and help bring
the project to completion. Cause
after all it is about you. So

00:00:46.146-->00:00:51.151
right now let me bring up the
well let me introduce the
producer and director of reverse

00:00:54.354-->00:00:59.359
engineering, Michael Lee
Nirenberg. [applause] >>Thank
you John. Thank you DefCon 26

00:01:03.997-->00:01:09.002
for having us, uh to give this
presentation. Uh some of you
this weekend thought I might be

00:01:11.338-->00:01:16.343
a narc. Which um, is not the
case, I’m on your side. Um my
partners and I suspect we’d find

00:01:18.745-->00:01:24.251
a susceptive audience here and
so thank you again for having
us. I’m at times a writer,

00:01:24.251-->00:01:30.090
filmmaker, and probably most
known as a commercial artist in
movies and TV. Uh I directed a

00:01:30.090-->00:01:35.395
documentary in Hustler magazine
that came out 4 years ago cause
my dad was our director, 70’s

00:01:35.395-->00:01:40.534
and 90’s. So if you’re
interested in watching, it’s
easy to find. Uh th reason I’m

00:01:40.534-->00:01:45.605
speaking to you today is that 4
years ago we set out to make a
documentary about the history of

00:01:45.605-->00:01:52.179
computer hacking and to get this
right involves bringing it to
you because this is about you

00:01:52.179-->00:01:57.184
too, um John. >>Kay I’d also
like to introduce another
producer, you might know him as

00:02:00.153-->00:02:05.158
Bill RNOC, Dave Buchwald
[applause] >>Hey [applause]
>>Thank you. What’s cooking

00:02:10.397-->00:02:16.503
DefCon? Um, m-my true given name
is Dave Buckwald and I’m a
hacker and I’m a filmmaker and a

00:02:16.503-->00:02:21.508
visual artist. And uh, and God
willing on the 13th I’m gonna be
23 years sober. This was movie

00:02:23.710-->00:02:28.715
magic, water. >>Well we’ve
[applause] >>Yeah, uh we’ve been
working on this project, Mike

00:02:34.755-->00:02:40.494
how long have we been working on
this for? >>Funny you should ask
John, 4 years. Started when I

00:02:40.494-->00:02:45.298
was gifted a copy of this book
Masters of Deception. Led me to
Bruce Sterling’s, Hacker

00:02:45.298-->00:02:50.737
Crackdown, Steven Levy’s
Hackers, John Markoff’s, What
the Dormouse Said. Phil

00:02:50.737-->00:02:55.409
Lapsley’s, Exploding the Phone
and a number of others that were
landmark books of the, of the

00:02:55.409-->00:03:00.947
early years of this thing. So
after doing the research I found
that there was no major docu-,

00:03:00.947-->00:03:06.453
documentary much less a major
docu-series on this subject. And
so we found a wormhole in the

00:03:06.453-->00:03:10.624
culture and the lane was open so
after doing the research we’ve
just started finding people and

00:03:10.624-->00:03:15.095
filming them. The first being
John Perry Barlow, which in
retrospect turned out to be

00:03:15.095-->00:03:20.534
quite Prussian. I’ve always been
a tech like many, I came of age
in the 90’s and was fascinated

00:03:20.534-->00:03:25.539
by the early web but I really
didn’t get really into it to the
beginning of consumer broadband

00:03:25.539-->00:03:31.311
in the early 2000’s. At that
point hacking’s infancy had just
passed. Now they’re great

00:03:31.311-->00:03:36.716
documentaries about specific
hacking moments. Uh it turned
out to be incredible resources

00:03:36.716-->00:03:42.656
for what we’re doing. But after
the research we realized that
there hasn’t’ been a single film

00:03:42.656-->00:03:48.328
that speaks about this thing,
the beginning of this thing to
the broader non-hacker world.

00:03:48.328-->00:03:54.101
And um, there’s a lot of people
who don’t understand it or
afraid of it. And it impacts

00:03:54.101-->00:03:56.103
their lives every day. >>Now 1
of the things that made me want
to be a part of the project was

00:03:56.103-->00:04:02.209
the connection to New York City.
Now, um, upon meeting the
hackers uh that we were

00:04:02.209-->00:04:07.214
interviewing like Dave. Uh most
of them are New York based. And
I’m a lifelong New Yorker. So

00:04:14.855-->00:04:19.759
when I was reading Masters of
Decep- uh, yeah, while I was
reading Masters of Deception, I,

00:04:19.759-->00:04:26.166
I was able to visualize a lot of
the places that they were
talking about. I know th- about

00:04:26.166-->00:04:29.870
the Greenacres mall and the
RadioShack there with the kids
would go to buy their computer

00:04:29.870-->00:04:34.975
parts and their modems and
stuff. So I was able to
visualize a lot of the places

00:04:34.975-->00:04:39.980
cause I had already been there.
And upon meeting Dave and ya
know the other people that, that

00:04:42.015-->00:04:47.154
from MOD and masters of
Defcp3tions, Legion of Doom. I
was able to really identify with

00:04:47.154-->00:04:52.993
them just because ya know, um
I’ve, I’ve felt that, ya know I
was like them. And I would have

00:04:52.993-->00:04:59.699
been friends with them in
school. So ya know bringing Dave
on as a producer for me was a no

00:04:59.699-->00:05:06.373
brainer. >>And uh, it would have
been hard to be friends with me
in school cause I, w- wasn’t in

00:05:06.373-->00:05:13.013
school, often I was behind my
computer uh most of the time.
And I’m here because in 1983,

00:05:13.013-->00:05:19.219
1984 I got an Apple 2E and a
little bit later a blazing Apple
CAT, blazing fast apple CAT

00:05:19.219-->00:05:24.224
modem. And I very soon after
that discovered text files and
TAP magazine, BBSs, later 2600

00:05:27.394-->00:05:31.998
magazine and uh I was the lead
singer of a group called Legion
of Doom until I was busted by

00:05:31.998-->00:05:38.672
the secret service in uh, the
summer of 87. And uh, I got my
first taste of working in the

00:05:38.672-->00:05:43.677
film industry as a uh, hacking
consultant on a movie Hackers
which is not a documentary. Um,

00:05:46.846-->00:05:53.486
many of you’ve probably seen
this uh, this wonderful piece.
Uh in, in the 90s I was working

00:05:53.486-->00:05:59.159
as a computer security
consultant with my old uh
hacking buddy, Fiber Optic until

00:05:59.159-->00:06:04.264
the dot com bubble burst and I
got sick of making money anyway
so I decided to become a film

00:06:04.264-->00:06:09.269
editor. And I’ve always observed
that the more you know about any
given subject the more kind of

00:06:11.738-->00:06:17.077
media distortion there is. And
th- the, ya know the public
perception gets so skewed and

00:06:17.077-->00:06:19.079
working on this film was kind of
my way of giving back to the
hacker community and really sh-

00:06:19.079-->00:06:21.081
ya know presenting ya know, not
just for new generation of
hackers but for general

00:06:21.081-->00:06:23.083
audiences, a kind of true
depiction of uh, of what went on
and what brought us, uh to where

00:06:23.083-->00:06:28.088
we are now. And, and, an
entertaining and non-didactic
way. >>So along with my 2

00:06:41.301-->00:06:45.939
partners from the Hustler movie,
John Torrani and um Flint Hood
Hausner couldn’t be here

00:06:45.939-->00:06:51.878
tonight, we met Dave while
tracking down members of th- uh
the early 90, late 80’s group uh

00:06:51.878-->00:06:57.117
Legion of Doom and turns out he
was also in Brooklynn like the
rest of us and made sense to

00:06:57.117-->00:07:02.555
join the team being a film
editor so he understood what we
were trying to do. And um, turns

00:07:02.555-->00:07:06.459
out to be a damn good film
producer which is how we ended
up here. >>That’s what I told

00:07:06.459-->00:07:12.599
them, um I primarily do picture
editing and producing and I’ve
always stayed close to my roots

00:07:12.599-->00:07:18.938
in that the hacker world, I’d
been the uh cover artist and
residence for 2600 Magazine

00:07:18.938-->00:07:24.377
doing all the covers since about
2001 and designing their
t-shirts it’s funny I see so

00:07:24.377-->00:07:29.949
many people wearing T-shirts uh
here that I designed ya know
behind my little computer, so

00:07:29.949-->00:07:34.954
that’s, that’s always cool. Um,
and uh, i- it’s funny what kind
of started as just like an

00:07:37.123-->00:07:43.930
impromptu uh, uh interview in my
boiler room has bloomed into
this like Herculean task of

00:07:43.930-->00:07:50.203
trying to document hacker
history. >>So I, I alluded to
it, we’re gonna show the uh

00:07:50.203-->00:07:56.343
20-minute clip so, um we, we
alluded to this early but there,
there’s very few documentaries

00:07:56.343-->00:08:00.480
about the original hacker
generations. Uh currently
there’s a great many of them

00:08:00.480-->00:08:06.686
being made about contemporary
hacking cause it’s much more um,
sexy to the film but the, it’s

00:08:06.686-->00:08:08.688
easier to do. The existing
documentaries, they are basic
cable, or homemade YouTube

00:08:08.688-->00:08:10.690
documentaries designed for other
hackers more or less. Some of
them are made quite good. Um my

00:08:10.690-->00:08:12.692
personal favorite is Annalisa
Savage’s um, Unauthorized Access
because it’s the first and it

00:08:12.692-->00:08:17.697
captured these guys in the
moment before the log closed in
on them. Uh there’s also Manuel

00:08:28.007-->00:08:33.279
Goldstein’s Freedom Downtime
which is about Kevin Minnick and
his, his case and Jason Scott’s

00:08:33.279-->00:08:39.986
ambitious 8 part documentary
series on BBS boards. Um, so
we’re doing something different

00:08:39.986-->00:08:43.690
so we can entertain like I had
mentioned earlier the non-hacker
community and pandering to the

00:08:43.690-->00:08:48.395
old school media’s sort of bull
s**t scare tactics um by talking
to people who were actually

00:08:48.395-->00:08:52.899
there. So John you want to set
up the scene? >>Um, sure, right
now we’re going to send, we’re

00:08:52.899-->00:08:58.838
going to show you guys a chunk
of the movie, now all 3 of us
had our hands in making this and

00:08:58.838-->00:09:03.777
please remember it is a work in
progress. >>Right th- it’s
important to note that none of

00:09:05.945-->00:09:11.051
the music has been cleared
because and it’s only temped in,
you clear the, when you have the

00:09:11.051-->00:09:16.289
lawyers to do the last step
because it costs so much money.
Uh the sound or colors hasn’t

00:09:16.289-->00:09:20.660
been mixed yet for the same
reason. And we filled the stage
it’s only right that we share it

00:09:20.660-->00:09:26.065
with the hacker community so we
can, g- get your input, see wh-
what we can, what else we could

00:09:26.065-->00:09:32.672
do with it, cause it’s big it’s
gonna be 3 parts. Um, I can’t, I
have to watch it with you cause

00:09:32.672-->00:09:37.677
I’m tethered to the thing, I
can’t walk away. So, which is
just terrifying. Uh, yeah. John.

00:09:39.813-->00:09:44.284
>>Yeah, well it’s I mean no
one's gonna walk out cause it’s
uh, it’s edited really well

00:09:44.284-->00:09:50.190
whoever edited it. So let’s show
it to you now. >>Meh he’s
alright but after we’re done

00:09:50.190-->00:09:55.195
here we’re gonna explain what
the p- 3 parts are. And we can’t
dim the lights because it’s the

00:09:55.195-->00:09:59.632
r- the rules. >>Pretend that
you’re in a movie theater right
now, the ambiance, the

00:09:59.632-->00:10:04.437
chandeliers. >>Can we take these
down though? >>Nope >>No >>Can’t
do anything >>I don’t know

00:10:36.135-->00:10:41.141
>>Alright enjoy. >> [Video
Playback] Today 5 hackers were
indicted on Federal wire fraud

00:10:47.347-->00:10:52.852
charges and NBC’s Gary Matsumoto
found their leader in unlikely
setting. >>That’s Phiber

00:10:52.852-->00:10:59.292
Optikwith a ph, described by
some as a computer genius by
others as a computer anarchist.

00:10:59.292-->00:11:03.897
>>When you’re a little kid
growing up you kind of feel like
you don’t have any control over

00:11:03.897-->00:11:08.902
what’s going on. As far as what
was going on in the news around
us, in the 80’s the Soviet Union

00:11:11.437-->00:11:17.644
was still a very real thing. We
were worried about nuclear war.
Ronald Reagan and Gorbachev are

00:11:17.644-->00:11:23.850
negotiating this stuff and you
hope it turns out okay but you
really don’t know from one day

00:11:23.850-->00:11:28.855
to the next if one day everybody
is just going to blow up. This
permeated culture it was in

00:11:32.292-->00:11:37.297
movies it was in music and it
was some scary s**t. Getting
online and sort of becoming part

00:11:40.300-->00:11:45.305
of this computer underground was
something we felt we had control
over in a world we had really no

00:11:49.475-->00:11:54.480
place in. >>New York was nothing
like how it is now. It was the
crack epidemic of huge

00:11:58.952-->00:12:05.792
proportions. Drugs in the
street, violence everywhere so
you have to be constantly aware

00:12:05.792-->00:12:12.165
and that sort of hyper awareness
translated into breaking into
computers and out of that came a

00:12:12.165-->00:12:18.938
new class of people, hackers.
Young people that knew
technology inside and out, that

00:12:18.938-->00:12:23.610
grew up with it and could see
the networks that were evolving
right before our eyes and could

00:12:23.610-->00:12:28.915
see where it was going and play
with it, build around it,
interrupt it. In some ways the

00:12:28.915-->00:12:33.920
curiosity that could only be
generated inside of like a busy
place like New York City. >>At

00:12:42.128-->00:12:48.101
the very beginning it was about
a shared interest in an illicit
world of information. And

00:12:48.101-->00:12:54.340
initially there were no barriers
because the world was free, too
important and subterranean and

00:12:54.340-->00:13:00.513
secret and accessible. >>At that
particular time the internet
existed but ya know most people

00:13:00.513-->00:13:06.686
weren’t really on it unless you
were at university or worked for
one of the various agencies you

00:13:06.686-->00:13:11.691
know in the scientific or
military. But there was a rise
of like these online BBSs and

00:13:13.793-->00:13:18.798
these uh networks. >>BBS stands
for bulletin board system and
this was how people would

00:13:21.301-->00:13:27.340
communicate with other people
that also had personal
computers. >>Once a computer is

00:13:27.340-->00:13:32.345
equipped with a modem it can
both send and receive messages
to and from any other computer

00:13:34.580-->00:13:40.286
in the world. That is also
equipped with a similar sort of
modem. >>The first time that I

00:13:40.286-->00:13:45.291
telnetted another machine half
way across the country I
realized that I was, I was

00:13:47.660-->00:13:52.665
connected to that computer way
over there. It was a religious
experience. >>A friend showed me

00:13:55.068-->00:13:59.706
this and he said, yeah I’m
calling up these bulletin board
systems and we could do all

00:13:59.706-->00:14:06.245
these things with them. You
would call a phone number put it
into a cradle and then it would

00:14:06.245-->00:14:11.984
answer and you would be able to
talk to the computer and then
you’d end up with uh, a bunch of

00:14:11.984-->00:14:16.923
strings and characters and
people’s names and I just
thought this was insane. I

00:14:16.923-->00:14:22.061
thought this was the greatest
thing ever. >>It was very very
slow. It would take days for

00:14:22.061-->00:14:27.300
messages to arrive sometimes.
>>The kid whose parents had an
extra phone line would leave his

00:14:27.300-->00:14:33.706
computer hooked up to the phone
all the time so that you could
call to that computer, there was

00:14:33.706-->00:14:37.944
someone who calls into some
other computer far away and this
computer called that one called

00:14:37.944-->00:14:44.851
that one. So it was a completely
kind of ad hoc mesh of
computers. >>You don’t know

00:14:44.851-->00:14:49.889
where this is, you don’t know
how it’s being done and at the
time that’s, that’s beyond

00:14:49.889-->00:14:56.462
belief. >>The first 1 I got on
was called Q-link which was the
precursor to AOL. And I got on

00:14:56.462-->00:15:00.867
there and I didn’t fit in at
all. I’m like yo who here likes
Biz Marque? And they were like

00:15:00.867-->00:15:07.840
yo, nobody likes black music.
And I was like oh man. It was
like and I got like trolled by

00:15:07.840-->00:15:12.779
like a guy, his name was like
NKOTB like New Kids on the
Block. And there’s a whole bunch

00:15:12.779-->00:15:17.784
of posts about hacking and I’m
like holy s**t, hacking,
breaking into computers. Sounds

00:15:23.422-->00:15:29.762
kind of cool. >>The computer
underground in the 80s was the
age of exploration and that’s in

00:15:29.762-->00:15:34.767
stark contrast to whatever
semblance of an underground that
exists today. It’s not about

00:15:38.838-->00:15:43.843
exploration it’s about theft,
it’s about bank fraud, it’s
about monetary gain

00:15:48.981-->00:15:53.986
unfortunately. >>You’re really
into computer huh? >>Yeah.
>>what are you doing? >>Dialing

00:15:59.158-->00:16:04.096
into the school’s computer. They
changed the password every
couple of weeks but I know where

00:16:10.069-->00:16:15.074
they write it down. >>One of the
biggest films I think had the
huge impact on me that came out

00:16:15.074-->00:16:20.446
in the early 80s was War Games
about a kid whose looking for a
video game company uh he’s a

00:16:20.446-->00:16:25.885
hacker, a lot of the things they
show in the movie are true to
life as far as how he goes about

00:16:25.885-->00:16:31.791
looking for systems, scanning
telephone exchanges for modems
and so on. >>I can’t tell you

00:16:31.791-->00:16:37.997
how many different hackers I’ve
interviewed, he said, I watched
that film, I asked for a modem

00:16:37.997-->00:16:43.469
for Christmas. >>It was at that
point that the word hackers was
nobody really knew in society

00:16:43.469-->00:16:49.742
took on a new meaning. Hacker
before had been someone had
MATAI who, who was a programmer

00:16:49.742-->00:16:56.315
and nobody ever saw them. An
hacker after War Games was the
kid uh ya know with acne that

00:16:56.315-->00:17:00.186
was about 15 who broke into
computers. These bands of
teenagers would begin exploring

00:17:00.186-->00:17:05.124
these things and they would do
sometimes fun things, sometimes
illicit things. >>All these

00:17:05.124-->00:17:11.631
bulletin board geeks were ha-
they were a funny bunch they
were basically just bonkers if

00:17:11.631-->00:17:15.334
somebody took their skateboards
and gave them modems, it
wouldn’t make much difference.

00:17:15.334-->00:17:20.573
>>it was not unusual to find a
system with a default login with
no password even on some

00:17:20.573-->00:17:25.444
relatively important systems.
And ya know, is this wrong or
right? It doesn’t really enter

00:17:25.444-->00:17:31.484
your mind. You’re really doing
it more out of curiosity. >>I
was a phone freak and a hacker.

00:17:31.484-->00:17:36.489
It’s like I loved telephones. So
just a computer itself was too
small. I, I liked the network.

00:17:38.824-->00:17:45.064
And there was no computer
network as large as the PSTN,
the Public Switched Telephone

00:17:45.064-->00:17:50.269
Network. >>The first modem I got
was a family friend was like
getting rid of an old

00:17:50.269-->00:17:55.007
vanderplaat modem. That was
pretty much the beginning of
like my road to service, ya know

00:17:55.007-->00:18:01.147
being a hack is what I do now.
There’s this big machine, how do
you like ya know get inside it

00:18:01.147-->00:18:05.851
and take it apart and play with
it? And then also, how do you
use it to create mischief.

00:18:05.851-->00:18:10.957
Eventually I was able to like
finagle an Apple CAT out of my
parents. Apple CAT could

00:18:10.957-->00:18:16.195
generate sound effects so you
could actually use it as a blue
box and do all kinds of things

00:18:16.195-->00:18:20.633
with it that you couldn’t do
with an ordinary modem. >>That
one was life changing because it

00:18:20.633-->00:18:25.938
was a very programmable modem
and you could produce any tone
that you wanted including the

00:18:25.938-->00:18:32.445
control tones for uh, in bend
signaling in phone networks and
basically take control, become

00:18:32.445-->00:18:37.416
an operator and just do anything
that you wanted. It’s pretty
magical when you’re a kid and

00:18:37.416-->00:18:44.123
you suddenly realize, hey I can
control the phone system.
>>Growing up in San Antonio,

00:18:44.123-->00:18:50.696
Texas there really weren’t any
other hackers there. Th- the big
scene in the early 80’s was

00:18:50.696-->00:18:55.701
primarily uh centered around New
York, New Jersey. And so that’s
where I ended up gravitating and

00:18:58.304-->00:19:02.642
that’s where I ended up meeting
a bunch of like-minded people.
>>There began to appear hacker

00:19:02.642-->00:19:08.848
groups, which were loose
affiliations of kids typically
that never met each other. They

00:19:08.848-->00:19:14.253
didn’t know each other’s
identity or any of that. They
came up with an alias, a handle

00:19:14.253-->00:19:20.793
and that’s how they affiliated
on these BBSs. >>I picked Eric
Bloodaxe because I read a really

00:19:20.793-->00:19:26.532
cool book about Vikings. It
sounded cool. My first name’s
Eric and so Eric Bloodaxe. Went

00:19:26.532-->00:19:30.970
from bulletin board to bulletin
board around the United States.
>>Now you have this knowledge

00:19:30.970-->00:19:35.975
base that’s forming of, systems.
How to use them and how to
maintain access to them. It was

00:19:38.944-->00:19:43.949
those early BBSs that turned
into what we refer to as the
elite BBSs. >>13 of us will form

00:19:46.385-->00:19:53.025
the most powerful and sinister
group the world has ever seen.
From now on we’ll be known as

00:19:53.025-->00:19:59.965
the Legion of Doom. >>Legion of
Doom was a super group of
hackers who were let’s say the

00:19:59.965-->00:20:06.138
very top of the game. >>I read
about the Legion of Doom and I
said like, if f**K it, if these

00:20:06.138-->00:20:09.909
guys can do that I can do that.
And I basically went out and
became the head of the Legion of

00:20:09.909-->00:20:15.181
Doom b- when it was like a
popularity contest. I had this
kind of overview of the

00:20:15.181-->00:20:21.954
inner-workings of AT&T better
than maybe any 1 single
employee. I would get off on

00:20:21.954-->00:20:26.525
being able to listen in on a
phone call or hank pulling. Like
you know you turn somebody’s

00:20:26.525-->00:20:31.230
phone into a payphone. Somebody
picks up the phone, dials the
phone to make a phone call and

00:20:31.230-->00:20:35.301
they get a recording telling
them to deposit a quarter or
taking a pay phone and turning

00:20:35.301-->00:20:41.273
it into a home phone. That was
what would help you gain uh,
popularity. >>If somebody hacked

00:20:41.273-->00:20:45.478
you, you tried to figure out a
way how to hack them back. It
was sort of a prankster-ism.

00:20:45.478-->00:20:51.150
>>Ya know we broke into a ton of
shit and we had broke into
companies that I’ll, ya know

00:20:51.150-->00:20:56.622
you, you would just be like
shocked at like the level of
data that’s stored. >>There’s a

00:20:56.622-->00:21:01.560
very, very strong ethos among
hacker underground communities
to keep quiet. If you’re calling

00:21:04.263-->00:21:09.335
attention to yourself through
these kind of audacious hacks
and, and groups guess who's

00:21:09.335-->00:21:14.240
gonna come knocking. >>It was
really hard to get in trouble
unless you were just doing

00:21:14.240-->00:21:19.245
something really wrong or really
misguided. That you’re drawing
unnecessary attention to

00:21:22.148-->00:21:27.253
yourself. >>People considered
Legion of Doom to be sort of at
the pinnacle of the computer

00:21:27.253-->00:21:33.526
underground. That didn’t just
end at th-the edge of the
computer bulletin boards. People

00:21:33.526-->00:21:37.530
within the regional bell
operating companies knew who
Legion of Doom was. People

00:21:37.530-->00:21:43.135
within the FBI and secret
service knew who the Legion of
Doom was. People in ya know

00:21:43.135-->00:21:47.706
corporate security for credit
bureaus knew who Legion of Doom
was. >>Law enforcement didn’t

00:21:47.706-->00:21:52.711
really know how to deal with it
I think at the time because it
was so new. >>There were laws

00:21:52.711-->00:21:58.584
going back to the 30’s from
telecommunications like wire
fraud. The wire fraud act which

00:21:58.584-->00:22:04.423
could be considered most
anything. There was in I think
it was around 1986 the computer

00:22:04.423-->00:22:11.163
fraud and abuse act which was
largely untested it was
certainly never tested in the

00:22:11.163-->00:22:16.735
mid 80’s by the late 80’s and
early 90’s it was the thing that
they were using uh to prosecute

00:22:16.735-->00:22:22.708
uh the lot of us but they were
really just trying to make a lot
of noise to show the public and

00:22:22.708-->00:22:27.213
the government that they were
doing something about the
problem. It’s a threat to big

00:22:27.213-->00:22:32.685
business, it’s some kind of
threat to infrastructure and
this is how to stop it. But

00:22:32.685-->00:22:39.525
kicking in doors and seizing
computers. >>Ya know they, they
weren’t that tech savvy the

00:22:39.525-->00:22:45.431
secret service in those days.
Seem more like they just wanted
to shut it down and make

00:22:45.431-->00:22:51.737
everyone stop doing what they
were doing. So they came to my
house in a UPS truck and uh, an

00:22:51.737-->00:22:58.010
assistant district attorney rang
my doorbell and said he was from
UPS and he asked my dad to sign

00:22:58.010-->00:23:01.313
the clipboard. Dad signed the
clipboard and says where’s the
package and he says, bring in

00:23:01.313-->00:23:07.486
the package. The back of the van
rolls up and ya know guys with
sledge hammers and there were

00:23:07.486-->00:23:13.392
guys with guns drawn come out of
the back of this UPS van,
they’re taking computers and

00:23:13.392-->00:23:19.632
taking notebooks. They weren’t
trying to put anybody in jail.
They were just basically trying

00:23:19.632-->00:23:25.271
to scare people into stopping.
>>There was 1 guy I knew that
said when the FBI came to his

00:23:25.271-->00:23:31.977
parents house to arrest him they
took all these, uh all of the
computers but left all these

00:23:31.977-->00:23:37.016
very important computer security
books that had tons of
information because they didn’t

00:23:37.016-->00:23:41.987
actually know what they were.
>>There was a kid I think he was
in Indiana, he got arrested for

00:23:41.987-->00:23:48.260
some kind of calling card fraud.
They saw he was all involved
with computers and they said,

00:23:48.260-->00:23:54.867
you’re a computer hacker are you
in Legion of Doom? He goes, no.
But I know some people who are.

00:23:54.867-->00:23:59.872
And that ultimately led to uh,
me being raided. >>Well I don’t
think you have to be that smart

00:24:03.242-->00:24:08.247
to know that if you get raided
by a 3-letter agency and you
never go to jail you must have

00:24:10.316-->00:24:15.321
sung like a bird. >>our top
story at 5, a massive offensive
by the US Secret service against

00:24:17.489-->00:24:21.727
the illegal computer hackers.
Search warrants are going out
here in Chicago and a dozen

00:24:21.727-->00:24:27.132
other cities coast to coast in
an effort to stop computer fraud
that is costing companies and

00:24:27.132-->00:24:32.237
consumers millions of dollars.
>>When law enforcement really
started making its presence

00:24:32.237-->00:24:38.243
known, busting into people’s
homes and, and seizing their,
their computers this effected

00:24:38.243-->00:24:44.216
um, a growing number of people
that I knew. There were certain
individuals who kinda thumbed

00:24:44.216-->00:24:50.923
their nose at the whole thing
and kind of had a more uh,
daring attitude. Uh at a time

00:24:50.923-->00:24:55.928
where n- when uh, when modesty
probably would have been better
course of action. It was

00:24:59.999-->00:25:05.003
probably around that time that I
had uh, falling out with uh,
with a particular, uh LOD member

00:25:09.608-->00:25:15.547
who by defacto, uh found himself
in charge of the group. >>Trying
to put together one of the

00:25:15.547-->00:25:20.552
Legion’s technical journals I
had was trying to map out
different um packet switch

00:25:22.988-->00:25:27.226
networks to identify all the
computers that existed on a
particular network. I knew

00:25:27.226-->00:25:32.865
Phiber Optik had access to
information about the internal
setup of the X25 network used by

00:25:32.865-->00:25:37.870
NYNEX. Which was the New York
telephone company. And I was
like alright well can you give

00:25:39.972-->00:25:44.243
me a breakdown of what’s on the,
the NYNEX packets switch network
so I can include it in the

00:25:44.243-->00:25:50.315
directory. And he said, yeah,
yeah sure I’ll get that to you,
he says if I give you that you

00:25:50.315-->00:25:57.089
need to give me this other
thing. I, like well, that’s not
mine to give so then later on

00:25:57.089-->00:26:02.461
Mark calls this other friend of
ours a guy name Bob. He says,
hey Bob, Chris told me to call

00:26:02.461-->00:26:06.765
you and get the login for this
system. He didn’t have it handy
and I need it now cause I’m

00:26:06.765-->00:26:10.202
trying to work on this thing and
he needs something from me so if
you just give me the login to

00:26:10.202-->00:26:15.874
this, this machine. So, Mark got
the account, ended up getting
that account lockout. So now we

00:26:15.874-->00:26:20.078
lost our access to that system.
So I found out about this later
on and I’m I called everybody

00:26:20.078-->00:26:25.818
else in Legion of Doom and I
said we need to kick this guy
out. So he hooked up with a

00:26:25.818-->00:26:31.323
bunch of his friends in New York
and started another group,
called Masters of Deception.

00:26:31.323-->00:26:36.228
>>LOD was falling apart. People
were getting, were getting
bussed by, by the government.

00:26:36.228-->00:26:43.202
Now a group that we had once
respected that I myself was
affiliated with was going off on

00:26:43.202-->00:26:48.640
a strange path that we didn’t
really agree with. >>MOD was
supposed to be just a joke

00:26:48.640-->00:26:54.313
playing off of LOD a little bit
but evidently there wasn’t
enough room for both of us on

00:26:54.313-->00:26:59.251
the networks of the world and
erupted eventually into
something called a great hacker

00:26:59.251-->00:27:04.323
war, where we start trying to
hack each other. Which was a lot
of fun but also caused a lot of

00:27:04.323-->00:27:10.095
trouble. >>From then on out the
deal was, let's get Goggins,
let’s get LOD >>Great hacker

00:27:10.095-->00:27:15.100
wars basically a, a disagreement
between guys that I knew and 1
of the members of LOD who um,

00:27:18.470-->00:27:24.176
let’s just say we thought was uh
engaging in some questionable
behavior as far as potentially

00:27:24.176-->00:27:30.883
turning in other hackers wasn’t
really considered a war until
the media turned this into a

00:27:30.883-->00:27:37.823
gang war inside cyberspace.
Especially in the 80’s, gang
violence was common. So I mean

00:27:37.823-->00:27:43.829
just writing off hacker groups
as just the online version of,
of violent gangs, made it easier

00:27:43.829-->00:27:49.935
for law enforcement or people
to, to visualize oh this is
wrong, this is bad. >>We are

00:27:49.935-->00:27:54.940
experiencing a crime wave in the
computer area that is just
astronomical. We can’t keep up,

00:27:57.209-->00:28:01.947
nobody whose working in this
field can keep up. This is not
victimless crime, we are all

00:28:01.947-->00:28:07.786
victims. >>So the media needs to
have a villain and in something
uh involving computers and

00:28:07.786-->00:28:12.791
technology very easy to label
somebody who is smart and a bit
mischievous as the villain

00:28:18.864-->00:28:23.402
because nobody’s really going to
be able to understand what it is
they’re doing. And they generate

00:28:23.402-->00:28:29.975
fear. >>The problem wasn’t
really ever identified, it was
just sort of uh, a speech that

00:28:29.975-->00:28:34.880
was repeated over and over again
by prosecutors uh and law
enforcement that there’s some

00:28:34.880-->00:28:40.986
kind of hacker menace, it needs
to be stopped by sending kids,
teenagers to jail. [music]

00:28:40.986-->00:28:45.991
[applause] >>And before you
catch the man. Uh I hope we
caught you. Um seems about the

00:29:18.757-->00:29:24.630
same amount of people I think.
>>That was better than I thought
it would be. >>Yeah >>Ya know

00:29:24.630-->00:29:30.736
>>Yeah so who wouldn’t want to
be a part of that? Um okay, so
yeah. >>Uh it’s s-where am I

00:29:30.736-->00:29:35.741
well um again I’m glad you s-
some of you stayed and um
interested enough to hear a

00:29:39.911-->00:29:44.883
samp. We’re doing the series in
3 parts because it’s so big and
we can’t compress into the old

00:29:44.883-->00:29:49.888
90-minute documentary format. So
part 1, is about the origin sort
of computer hacking several of

00:29:55.160-->00:30:00.799
concurrent trends were evolving
to create the conditions that
led to the personal computer. In

00:30:00.799-->00:30:04.970
this section we meet the first
generation of phone freaks, the
corporations that created the

00:30:04.970-->00:30:10.509
personal computer, and the first
hackers emerge from MIT and
Stanford. The government

00:30:10.509-->00:30:14.579
develops Arpanet. All these
unique conditions were just
right to develop the personal

00:30:14.579-->00:30:19.584
computer. John. >>Yeah um for
those of us who were born after
1990 um Dave can you explain

00:30:23.889-->00:30:30.095
what phone freaking is? >>Yeah
uh, w- talked about it a little
bit in the uh clip we showed.

00:30:30.095-->00:30:36.768
The, the, th-the phone network
was a, the, uh ya know largest
vast wide ranging network in the

00:30:36.768-->00:30:42.007
world and uh, ya know back then
uh, I try to tell this to my
kids now, ya know phones didn’t

00:30:42.007-->00:30:47.579
have cameras or apps, or touch
screens and ya know Modbell was
a cheap mother but you could

00:30:47.579-->00:30:52.184
pick up your phone, you could
make a couple of tones and be
connected to anyone anywhere in

00:30:52.184-->00:30:56.722
the world, make somebody’s bell
ring in somebody’s house at 3 in
the morning on the other side of

00:30:56.722-->00:31:01.359
the world. And the hacker spirit
was there, and I knew there was
a lot going on beneath the

00:31:01.359-->00:31:07.265
surface and uh, the trick was
finding out about it and there,
ya know there wasn’t google and

00:31:07.265-->00:31:12.404
there weren’t BBSs that you
could log onto but there were
technical journals and uh, uh

00:31:12.404-->00:31:19.044
internal manuals and reverse
engineering that the uh, the
early groups of ya know freaks

00:31:19.044-->00:31:25.317
learned to f- ya know figure out
this networks from the inside
out. And uh, part of the beauty

00:31:25.317-->00:31:29.955
of a lot of these early networks
is s-security was an
afterthought if it was there at

00:31:29.955-->00:31:34.960
all. And uh, it was kind of
uncharted territory back then.
And I remember uh, an old phone

00:31:37.462-->00:31:42.467
freak friend of mine told me uh
and this is back when I was a
little, little kid, um that used

00:31:45.437-->00:31:50.242
to be able to call in to the,
they discovered you call into
the white house and you get the

00:31:50.242-->00:31:54.679
switchboard operator and you
politely get them to get off the
phone with you and you just sit

00:31:54.679-->00:31:59.050
there and you’re on an empty
line and there’s not sound at
all and a minute later you here

00:31:59.050-->00:32:05.390
a click and the next inbound
call coming in to the president
is connected to you. >>So as

00:32:05.390-->00:32:09.928
many of you know um hacking
meant something different at
first and why this is very

00:32:09.928-->00:32:15.467
obvious to you DefCon attendees
it’s not broadly known. And I
mentioned a great many books on

00:32:15.467-->00:32:20.539
the origins of computer phone
hacking, however the
prankster-ism that, that wasn’t

00:32:20.539-->00:32:26.044
yet malicious. Um, but aside
from freaking there’s a moment
where big university computers

00:32:26.044-->00:32:30.415
are being installed in, in
universities as I mentioned
earlier much of the hacking

00:32:30.415-->00:32:35.420
movement can be traced to 1960’s
MIT and Stanford’s uh, AI lab.
This, the grad students in

00:32:37.489-->00:32:41.293
electrical engineering became
interested in these machines
which they had to timeshare,

00:32:41.293-->00:32:46.798
hack to test the boundaries
which is where we get the term
from. Um they, they never would

00:32:46.798-->00:32:53.171
have predicted all the things
you were doing. >>Now much like
the title reverse engineering

00:32:53.171-->00:33:00.078
suggests, we kind of have to
work backwards as filmmakers so
we’re always asking who came

00:33:00.078-->00:33:05.083
before them, and who came before
them? >>Right, the, the lure of
Steve Jobs is he was uh creating

00:33:09.788-->00:33:15.327
Apple is a story we all know but
the culture they emerged from is
far undervalued and w- is for

00:33:15.327-->00:33:20.365
our purpose is what we’re
interested in exploring. So s-
uh part 2, is about the personal

00:33:20.365-->00:33:26.004
computer and the individual.
Like the last section several
concurrent trends emerged at the

00:33:26.004-->00:33:31.042
same time. Electrical
engineering students began jobs
at places like Intel, Xerox

00:33:31.042-->00:33:36.047
Parc, IBM, Hewlett Packard, the
Homebrew Computer Club and the
People’s computer company start

00:33:38.049-->00:33:42.120
up and computer hobbyists get
together, after hours to
exchange information. Freakers

00:33:42.120-->00:33:47.359
too become interested, there’s a
race to invent the personal
computer. This is well known.

00:33:47.359-->00:33:52.530
Bay Area’s rock culture,
psychedelic drugs, self-help
gurus and hippy scenes emerge

00:33:52.530-->00:33:57.535
with the mass as Silicon Valley.
>>The, the third part to of the
series where you saw an excerpt

00:34:00.071-->00:34:06.444
from, uh the, ya know we were
thinking of is, ya know the war
games and post war games

00:34:06.444-->00:34:10.081
generation. And I mean who
thought at the time that this
film would come out that would

00:34:10.081-->00:34:15.086
kind of motivate uh, ya know
whole generation of teens and
preteens to get into computers

00:34:17.222-->00:34:22.227
and go outfit their computers
with modems? >>Right in part 3
we concentrate on the kids that

00:34:22.227-->00:34:26.932
grew up with the modem and how
it changed the world as you saw
in the clip. Uh personal

00:34:26.932-->00:34:31.836
computers make their way to the
market and popular culture.
Modems open up the early web in

00:34:31.836-->00:34:37.542
creating a population explosion,
teen hacker cultures emerge,
government closes in, law,

00:34:37.542-->00:34:43.815
arrest result and the internet
goes mainstream. >>So Dave
>>Yeah >>C-can you tell a story

00:34:43.815-->00:34:48.853
from when you were a little boy?
>>Sure, when I was a teenager
exploring other people’s

00:34:48.853-->00:34:54.626
computer networks it was a
simpler time. A-and I remember
my dad used to regale many

00:34:54.626-->00:34:59.764
stories about uh when he was a
kid they would go to the movies
with 12 cents and they’d be able

00:34:59.764-->00:35:04.302
to take a trolley to the movies
and have something to eat and go
back home again and he also used

00:35:04.302-->00:35:09.841
to tell me like tw-1200 mod is
the fasted you’ll ever get data
to transfer over a twisted

00:35:09.841-->00:35:14.846
copper pair. And it, it was
simpler times and times change.
And ya know, b-back in the 80’s

00:35:17.048-->00:35:21.786
you would find uh ya know
systems that were wide open with
default passwords or no

00:35:21.786-->00:35:26.791
passwords at all with documented
source code and compilers on
board and, and uh ya know, w-we

00:35:30.095-->00:35:35.700
would backdoor these systems so
even if we were discovered ya
know by that point ya know we it

00:35:35.700-->00:35:40.038
was, ya know the point was moot.
One of my favorite things we
used to do is make it so if you

00:35:40.038-->00:35:45.643
typed pink Floyd at the login
prompt you’d be dropped down to
a root shell and uh ya know

00:35:45.643-->00:35:52.450
things got backed up and uh, ya
know passed on to the uh, ya
know the upgrades of the, the

00:35:52.450-->00:35:57.455
systems as they went on. And uh,
ya know uh, I ya know one of the
things that’s important to

00:36:01.860-->00:36:06.865
really uh keep in mind is uh ya
know a sense of uh, of history
and how uh, uh ya know, ya know

00:36:09.567-->00:36:14.572
things like plastic whistles and
punch cards will ya know will
give way to ya know teens,

00:36:16.908-->00:36:23.415
depositing uh w- source code on
uh open source, GitHub
repositories and landing this

00:36:23.415-->00:36:29.554
cush jobs at google and amazon
by the time their peach fuzz is
turning into a neck beard. And

00:36:29.554-->00:36:34.559
how each uh, ya know iteration
of, of hackers gives into the
next generation uh until we wind

00:36:37.328-->00:36:43.701
up here today at DefCon 26.
>>right w-we’re almost done. Um
before we open the floor to

00:36:43.701-->00:36:48.206
questions I’d like to make some,
just a few points that we
recognize it’s an international

00:36:48.206-->00:36:53.211
story and because it’s a medium
with time space limitations we
have to limit it to American

00:36:55.613-->00:37:01.019
hacking from the late 50’s to
the early 90’s before it comes
mainstream. So it’s pretty well

00:37:01.019-->00:37:06.357
covered by other people after a
certain time frame. And we
haven’t quite defined where to

00:37:06.357-->00:37:12.230
land it, um the, what was
happening in the early 90’s with
Kevin Minnick story seems to be

00:37:12.230-->00:37:17.302
a good place as any but we’re
interested in maybe figuring out
what really is the end of the

00:37:17.302-->00:37:22.307
first uh generation of it. And
it’s a non-linear story so maybe
you can help us figure out where

00:37:24.576-->00:37:30.048
the line is. So um, thanks for
your time and uh. >>Yeah
>>Thanks, thanks for staying.

00:37:30.048-->00:37:35.053
>>yeah I mean just so, uh y-ya
know we need help and ya know
insight is im-important which is

00:37:37.655-->00:37:43.728
why we wanted to kind of bring
this out to the hacker community
now, ya know while we’re still

00:37:43.728-->00:37:50.268
uh, while we’re still in a
process of, of w- uh taping
interviews, ya know we need help

00:37:50.268-->00:37:55.707
finding the kind of buried
stories that uh ya know, shape
the, shape the world that have

00:37:55.707-->00:38:01.613
been forgotten and also find the
ya know old timers before they
become buried people and kind of

00:38:01.613-->00:38:06.518
find the ya know the anonymous
people who wouldn’t give an
interview 10 years ago and uh ya

00:38:06.518-->00:38:12.757
know the unsung heroes and even
like y-ya know Teleco security
dudes and prosecutors and, and

00:38:12.757-->00:38:17.762
feds that were around uh in that
time period, uh who helped uh
kind of shape uh the, the

00:38:21.299-->00:38:26.304
perception and shape the uh
community. >>Um, so before we
take questions I just wanna

00:38:28.373-->00:38:33.945
thank everyone for coming um
we’ve got stickers on the table
outside everybody grab a sticker

00:38:33.945-->00:38:38.950
on your way out. Um, most
importantly, I, I need, I need
to clarify, this presentation

00:38:44.222-->00:38:49.227
okay although we are still
looking for investment partners,
we are looking for investment

00:38:51.396-->00:38:56.401
partners, this presentation was
not about that okay. That’s not
what this presentation was for.

00:38:59.571-->00:39:04.509
That’s what the bar is for.
[laughter] Okay? So we’re gonna
be here all weekend please come

00:39:06.578-->00:39:11.583
find us. So uh >>well also be at
Snackus Maximus >>we saw the
Snackus Maximus, we’re going to

00:39:14.385-->00:39:19.924
hit that too. So at one of >>And
the pool party >>Either, either
karaoke, there’s karaoke

00:39:19.924-->00:39:24.929
tonight, we’ll be at that. Um,
we will now open the floor to
questions. >>Oh great, there’s

00:39:29.601-->00:39:34.606
no questions. >>You sir,
glasses. >>Besides the DefCon
here, who is your target

00:39:38.676-->00:39:44.515
audience? >>Well really anybody.
We, we want to, we wanna put
this into plain language that

00:39:44.515-->00:39:50.288
anybody can understand, s- um
Mike and I are lay people, we
are not, right is that the word?

00:39:50.288-->00:39:55.493
>>Yeah >>Yeah, w-we’re, we
don’t, we don’t uh w-w- uh, we
went to a couple other talks to

00:39:55.493-->00:40:00.198
see what they’re like and the
whole time we’re like, Dave what
the f**k are they talking about?

00:40:00.198-->00:40:07.071
What is, w-w-what is this about?
Oh, okay. There was a guy, there
was a kid in here before , I

00:40:07.071-->00:40:10.808
just thought he was like
wrestling with his pen. He kept
like going like this with his

00:40:10.808-->00:40:15.813
pen and I had no idea, I didn’t
know, I had no idea what this
thing was about. So, so it, it’s

00:40:17.915-->00:40:22.120
we’re gonna try to put it into
plain language that anybody can
understand. >>Because it’s

00:40:22.120-->00:40:26.124
fascinating nonetheless >>Yeah
>>I mean from a cultural
standpoint. This aside from the

00:40:26.124-->00:40:32.997
tech aspect of it, it’s a
cultural phenomenon changing the
way we live our lives. >>Anybody

00:40:32.997-->00:40:39.871
else, you sir also glasses and
beard. >>How far along are you
in the process? >>Well um,

00:40:39.871-->00:40:45.877
we’re, we’re talking about this
earlier, basically we’ve done
about uh 19 or 20, 20 some odd

00:40:45.877-->00:40:52.183
interviews but we’ve got about
100 interviews we wanna do.
>>we’ve got a lot of people who,

00:40:52.183-->00:40:56.454
who’ve come out and have said
they, they want to be interviews
and so th-there’s other people

00:40:56.454-->00:41:01.326
we’re seeking out and there’s
other people that are uh have
approached us. So it’s just

00:41:01.326-->00:41:04.929
people are starting to find out
about what we’re doing. >>it’s
difficult with the whole

00:41:04.929-->00:41:10.234
multi-generational layer to it
and like finding people that
were active in this stuff in

00:41:10.234-->00:41:15.306
the, in the mid 60’s ya know
puts them in their, ya know some
of them in their 80’s now. >>Oh

00:41:15.306-->00:41:19.310
yeah, we’ve gotta get the dead
people ya know it’s like, we’ve
gotta actually we’ve got to dig

00:41:19.310-->00:41:24.182
up the dead people to get them.
>>Okay you, you sir over there.
>>So were you going to cover

00:41:24.182-->00:41:28.019
Steven Johnson Gaines? >>Hell
yeah we are. >>Yup >>Yup
>>[inaudible] secret service

00:41:28.019-->00:41:33.024
would want >>Yes >>Yes, do you
know him? >>No >>We can get h-,
I know someone in the NSA, yeah

00:41:35.626-->00:41:40.565
>>Huh >>I don’t think that’s a
hard 1 to get, but yes.
Definitely. >>Yes uh you in the,

00:41:40.565-->00:41:45.570
you in the center area I saw
your hand go up. >>What was the
name of the documentary. >>Oh um

00:41:49.874-->00:41:54.879
>>Reverse engineering, this one,
yeah. Reverse Engineering, it’s
fine. >>Boom, boom. Um, who

00:42:00.685-->00:42:06.290
else, uh wh- anybody else got a
question? Anybody got a
suggestion? What didn’t you

00:42:06.290-->00:42:10.762
like? What was not good about
it? >>Oh wait you didn’t really
like it. >>Criticism, oh you,

00:42:10.762-->00:42:15.767
also glasses back to you.
>>[inaudible audience comment]
>>Oh hell yeah >>Yeah >>This I

00:42:31.516-->00:42:37.455
mean th-the thing what’s
difficult about playing such a
small, e-each of the parts that

00:42:37.455-->00:42:43.494
we talked about is gonna be uh,
uh ya know if we’re doing it as,
as feature life it’s gonna be

00:42:43.494-->00:42:49.133
running approximately an hour to
an hour and a half and go in ya
know kind of drill down with

00:42:49.133-->00:42:55.306
that detail on >>But that’s
>>The errors and different
things, but what we showed is

00:42:55.306-->00:43:00.244
n-not to be construed as a, a
picture of what there was, it’s
just like it’s a scene from a

00:43:04.449-->00:43:09.454
section not a the entire section
per say. >>W-which is why we
want to do it in 3 parts because

00:43:11.989-->00:43:15.893
it’s a massive story, I mean
it’s not as simple as like, like
we were talking about the old

00:43:15.893-->00:43:20.331
documentary format which was 90
minutes. Like the, the hustler
movie that him and I did, when,

00:43:20.331-->00:43:24.569
when that came out we were only
able to get a major distributor
because it was 90 minutes

00:43:24.569-->00:43:28.940
because it was the, the package.
And that was like 4 years ago.
Now it’s changed, like

00:43:28.940-->00:43:32.143
everything is >>Everything is a
series now >>Yeah I mean >>Which
is better >>With the streaming

00:43:32.143-->00:43:37.682
services and ya know >>Everyone
wants a series >>And looking ya
know talking y-ya know HBO, and

00:43:37.682-->00:43:44.121
Netflix and things along those
lines it, it allows for like
longer form documentary series

00:43:44.121-->00:43:50.828
uh to allow you to, to cover the
big picture. >>You can stretch
out more >>Yeah, so uh that was

00:43:50.828-->00:43:55.199
a compliment, anymore
compliments? [laughter] >>Who
was complimenting >>Thank you

00:43:55.199-->00:44:02.039
>>It was good man, I liked it
>>Thank you >>Oh you sir in the
blue shirt >>Is it available

00:44:02.039-->00:44:07.111
online anywhere to view for
other people? >>The clip is,
we’re still making it >>Yeah

00:44:07.111-->00:44:12.850
this, the >>I wanna talk to you
Tuck I know about you. >>This
th-the sample scene that we

00:44:12.850-->00:44:18.256
showed is on our website and
there’s also a, a short sales
real, it’s like a ya know 2

00:44:18.256-->00:44:24.095
minute sizzle its >>We’ll take,
we’ll take cash, which I hate
>>Um, but uh the, there’s a

00:44:24.095-->00:44:29.100
short sizzle real and as well as
uh the sample scene. >>Kay, so,
oh. >>[audience

00:44:47.985-->00:44:52.990
comments-inaudible] >>Uh find us
at the bar. We’ll, >>We know him
already, that’s our man. Wait,

00:44:58.763-->00:45:03.701
is that Steve? >>Oh yeah that’s
Steve. That was good. >>What up
Steve? Thank you. So I, so how

00:45:06.571-->00:45:11.576
do we reconcile what the, the
sort of modern >>[ audience
comments-inaudible] >>Well no it

00:45:20.084-->00:45:25.022
turned out somewhat dystopian.
Right it started out with all
this utopian promise, especially

00:45:25.022-->00:45:30.595
if you look at the stuff in the
60s at the dawn of the ya know
where like the psychedelic Bay

00:45:30.595-->00:45:35.800
Area, it all kind of comes
together under this utopian
shell. It did change everything,

00:45:35.800-->00:45:40.705
it may not be the way we, that
the, the computer culture had
wanted it to be. >>I think, some

00:45:40.705-->00:45:45.710
of the u-u-utopia is a kind of a
carrot on a stick, it’s like
always as new technologies

00:45:48.179-->00:45:52.917
emerge it’s always like, oh but
ya know, ya know networking is
going to save us and the

00:45:52.917-->00:45:58.723
internet of things is going to
save us and n- and it's, its
always something to strive for

00:45:58.723-->00:46:03.261
uh >>And some of it is still
quite utopian some of it ya
know, it’s not all terrible.

00:46:03.261-->00:46:08.566
Some of it’s terrible ya know.
>>Yeah >>Election hacking >>I
saw, we, we have 3, uh alright

00:46:08.566-->00:46:14.772
you first. >>Alright have you
considered going past pre, and
covering like modern day? >>We’d

00:46:14.772-->00:46:18.342
love to >>Yes sure >>It’s just
hard to find the money for the
original part. Ya know, but

00:46:18.342-->00:46:24.815
yeah, we’d love to, I mean I’d
love to do uh, I’d love to do 12
parts. Ya know we’re super

00:46:24.815-->00:46:30.421
ambitious. >>Yeah there’s no sh-
there’s no shortage of sauce, of
source material. >>The I mean

00:46:30.421-->00:46:37.028
part of th-the th-thing, eh uh
it kind of in the film making
standpoint is, like we wanna

00:46:37.028-->00:46:43.634
have as much first, firsthand
and first party uh ac-account as
we possibly can of ya know first

00:46:43.634-->00:46:49.807
person interviews and w-with the
timeframe that’s going on we’re
on the, the, the far end of the

00:46:49.807-->00:46:55.980
curve now and we need to do like
we have John Perry Barlow and we
sat down with him for 4 and a

00:46:55.980-->00:47:01.752
half hours that’s not possible
today and it’s a shame because
it’d be nice to go back to him

00:47:01.752-->00:47:05.022
after we talked to other people
and say well ya know some of
these other people said this and

00:47:05.022-->00:47:10.027
w-what else can you say about
this to be in a different part.
And it’s not possible anymore.

00:47:10.027-->00:47:16.233
So w-w- ya know it’s especially
when you’re documenting the
past, it’s that has to be given

00:47:16.233-->00:47:21.172
priority because it’s fleeting
unfortunately. >>W—one more
point on this is the last

00:47:21.172-->00:47:26.777
documentary I made with him that
the, the one on hustler magazine
there is 5 people in it who are

00:47:26.777-->00:47:32.450
dead ya know, which is, y-ya
know the clock is always
running. One of who went to the

00:47:32.450-->00:47:37.455
electric chair. >>Well lethal
injection but anyway. Uh guy
from M- will you, will you have

00:47:40.791-->00:47:46.163
Mohawk come? >>Yeah >>Yeah, did
you win? >>I think we’re be
given the time signal >>Oh, oh

00:47:46.163-->00:47:49.767
sorry I didn’t see >>Is that the
time sig? 1-minute, ok Mohawk
guy you’re the last question.

00:47:49.767-->00:47:54.972
>>A little bit off the topic but
what do you think about um
working on the Modern Hackers

00:47:54.972-->00:47:58.642
after the time? >>Uh what did I
think at the time, uh it, it was
pretty funny I mean it was right

00:47:58.642-->00:48:01.779
after this uh esquire article
uh, about hackers had come out
and uh, Michelle Pfeiffer on the

00:48:01.779-->00:48:03.781
cover of, of the issue and uh
um, and it, I mean it was, it
was Raphael who wrote the uh

00:48:03.781-->00:48:08.786
screens ply uh came to a lot of
the 2600 meetings and new a lot
of kind of local New York people

00:48:25.770-->00:48:30.708
and tried to bring them in
either personality wise or
handle wise. Then the whole

00:48:30.708-->00:48:35.713
thing god Hollywood-ed and uh,
and then with uh a layer of
British uh, directing of

00:48:41.652-->00:48:46.657
American events on top of it was
fun. It was fun, d- I enjoyed
it, uh ya know e- e- I, I like

00:48:49.660-->00:48:55.599
filmmaking so I enjoyed it on
that level but I mean its, it’s
its storytelling and it’s, it’s

00:48:55.599-->00:49:00.538
fictional. >>I expected you all
to dress like that. C-can we
take anymore, or are we? >>We’ll

00:49:02.673-->00:49:07.211
see you later tonight, I will go
with you. >>Okay, can we take
one more or are we are we good?

00:49:07.211-->00:49:12.216
Out of time, okay. >>Alright
thank you so much. >>DefCon 26
>>Muah >>Thank you
