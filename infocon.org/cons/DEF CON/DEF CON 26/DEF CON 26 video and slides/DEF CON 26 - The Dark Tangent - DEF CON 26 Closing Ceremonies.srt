00:00:00.167-->00:00:05.172
>>Welcome to the closing
ceremonies of DefCon [cheering]
>>Woo! [whistling] >>Okay. So

00:00:12.679-->00:00:17.818
you all noticed it was an
experiment I talked about it a
little bit in the program, we’ve

00:00:17.818-->00:00:22.623
never been in multiple hotels
like this where you have to
actually go out and see the sun.

00:00:22.623-->00:00:27.628
And I was really worried about
that [booing from audience] yeah
[laughs] yeah yeah so we’re

00:00:30.664-->00:00:35.669
we’re uh we have a plan for next
year that does not involve
destroying the sun um

00:00:41.341-->00:00:46.346
[laughter][booing] um [laughs]
the ‘orb’ as I call it um so
it’s uh as I mentioned this is

00:00:51.852-->00:00:56.823
the last time we were here, this
is the last year uh we’re at
Caesar’s and next year we’re

00:00:56.823-->00:01:01.762
back to some old favorites.
We’ll talk about that in a
minute but just to let you know

00:01:01.762-->00:01:07.434
with all of this growth it
allowed us to try a lot of new
things um we used over four

00:01:07.434-->00:01:14.408
hundred thousand square feet of
space and we’re across three
hotels the Linq was the workshop

00:01:14.408-->00:01:19.413
hotel um [cheering] yay
workshops! >>Woo! >>Um this year
also was like a record year for

00:01:23.483-->00:01:30.157
people who made badges, it was
crazy we [yell from audience]
how many badges over a hundred

00:01:30.157-->00:01:34.761
different badges and then we
lost track that’s not even
counting the shitty add ons

00:01:34.761-->00:01:39.766
[laughter] and so yeah there’s a
lot and so um one thing I wanted
to say is at the last minute I

00:01:42.803-->00:01:47.107
got this brainwave and I was
like you know what I should
start a museum for all these

00:01:47.107-->00:01:52.713
badges. Why don’t everybody just
give me badges and I’ll put them
in a museum and that was a

00:01:52.713-->00:01:58.719
little kind of half baked what I
really should have done is set
up an area given you money you

00:01:58.719-->00:02:04.191
give me badges and I would have
this authoritative collection
but even at the last minute over

00:02:04.191-->00:02:08.895
twenty five of the hundred
donated badges to me, I’ll
collect them, we’ll have them on

00:02:08.895-->00:02:13.600
display for next year, and next
year we’ll have a proper way for
you if you want to sell us a

00:02:13.600-->00:02:19.039
badge and we’ll create sort of a
a whole history um of the badges
because I think it’s really cool

00:02:19.039-->00:02:22.809
and unique and I’m afraid we’re
going to lose some of that
history so I just wanna start

00:02:22.809-->00:02:27.814
doing this year after year so
we’re going to be doing that
>>Woo! >>Yay! [applause] so for

00:02:32.853-->00:02:38.592
those of you in your hotel rooms
or uh in the speaking tracks,
last year you knew it was kind

00:02:38.592-->00:02:45.232
of a disaster, we had a lot of
wiring and cabling and interface
laptop video issues we lost

00:02:45.232-->00:02:50.404
three hundred and fifteen
minutes of s t speaking last
year due to technical problems

00:02:50.404-->00:02:55.409
and this year we lost around
ten. [applause] yeah. I don’t
think anybody even would have

00:02:58.578-->00:03:03.517
noticed but since we’re trying
to be more transparent um
there’s ten. [laughs] >>We have

00:03:07.020-->00:03:13.894
a tradition here at DefCon, our
number one Paul Proctor will be
leaving our team after twenty

00:03:13.894-->00:03:18.899
years [cherreing] please DefCon
welcome, help us give him a
toast, to Paul Proctor

00:03:28.275-->00:03:35.048
[cheering]cheers! [applause]
>>I’d like to thank all of those
that I’ve shot over the years,

00:03:35.048-->00:03:40.053
thank you. >>Thank you Proctor!
>>Love you man. Okay so, we also
started last year, uh this

00:03:47.127-->00:03:52.132
transparency report I I wanted
to do um and so we’ve continued
it this year so uh I as I’ve

00:03:54.801-->00:04:00.607
predicted what I hope, what I
hope is happening is that you
will see that we are trying

00:04:00.607-->00:04:06.680
really hard to take these issues
seriously and that we’re trying
to act on them and when you do

00:04:06.680-->00:04:13.019
report something we do something
about it uh if we can and so I’m
expecting this numbers to go up

00:04:13.019-->00:04:16.957
year after year after year as
people get comfortable
reporting, seeing that we

00:04:16.957-->00:04:21.995
actually are uh uh serious about
this I think for the next four
or five years we’re just gonna

00:04:21.995-->00:04:26.766
see these numbers increase until
we level off uh and only by sort
of facing this problem head on

00:04:26.766-->00:04:32.405
are we really going to know the
magnitude of of the issues, so
um so the numbers yes, did go up

00:04:32.405-->00:04:37.310
this year which I think is good
and we were better at tracking
them and we introduced a hotline

00:04:37.310-->00:04:41.915
uh for people to report things.
So to talk about this and
deliver this year’s uh

00:04:41.915-->00:04:46.920
statistics I’d like to bring the
head of our SOK up, uh CJ.
[applause] >>Okay. Alright well

00:05:00.100-->00:05:06.606
first of all I wanna thank all
of our partners >>Microphone!
[multiple voices from audience]

00:05:06.606-->00:05:12.012
>>[laughs] I’m not loud enough.
First of all I’d like to thank
all of our partners across all

00:05:12.012-->00:05:16.917
of our departments and across
the hotel, we wouldn’t have been
able to be this successful

00:05:16.917-->00:05:21.922
without their help. So, the
numbers, we had 3 reports of
harassment, 7 reports of sexual

00:05:24.658-->00:05:29.663
harassment, 1 report of sex- of
sexual assault, 7 medical
incidents, none requiring an

00:05:32.933-->00:05:37.704
ambulance this time which is an
improvement from last year
>>woo! [from audience] >>So

00:05:37.704-->00:05:42.709
whether you guys are getting
better at drinking, or?
[laughter] 2 reports of theft, 3

00:05:45.712-->00:05:50.717
reports of vandalism, 1 case of
trespassing, 1 case of the
ceiling falling >>Again

00:05:55.222-->00:06:00.160
[laughter] >>Again. One badge
maker exonerated, 1 attack on
the casino folded, 1 dust storm

00:06:11.037-->00:06:16.476
[laughter], attendees of other
conferences thinking that we
hacked them when we didn't, one.

00:06:16.476-->00:06:21.481
[laughter]. Oh uh sorry there’s
one that’s off, off of here. One
warning issued to a member of

00:06:31.458-->00:06:36.463
staff whose conduct wasn’t
appropriate and didn’t represent
what we as a team would like to

00:06:38.898-->00:06:43.903
represent to you. Alright.
[applause]. Support line. We got
62 calls in total. 42 of those

00:06:57.517-->00:07:02.856
were general information calls
asking where things were
[laughter] it’s kind of to be

00:07:02.856-->00:07:07.861
expected. But we did get 3
harassment calls, 5 sexual
harassment calls, 1 call for

00:07:12.332-->00:07:17.337
medical help, and 1 conce- 1
call over concerns about drink
tampering. That is awesome.

00:07:19.406-->00:07:24.411
>>Woo! [applause] >>So we’re
doing it again next year [off
mic] >>Obviously we’re gonna do

00:07:27.981-->00:07:34.421
this again next year and we’re
going to scan it up and I want
you guys to use it more, less

00:07:34.421-->00:07:40.193
information calls please, we do
have an information booth in
lots of locations, but you know

00:07:40.193-->00:07:46.966
I understand um at the same time
please trust us call us we’ve
got trained people that there to

00:07:46.966-->00:07:51.971
help you, and we wanna help you.
So the next thing is as you are
all aware, there have been a lot

00:07:55.241-->00:08:00.146
of concerns about new processes
adopted across the Las Vegas
hotels, this isn’t just

00:08:00.146-->00:08:05.919
Caesar’s, it’s across all the
hotels, um there’s a change,
these changes represent a new

00:08:05.919-->00:08:10.924
reality that all hotels have to
face in their work to keep
guests safe. We hear your

00:08:15.095-->00:08:21.468
concerns and Caesar’s is an
extremely receptive partner.
They’re already engaged with us

00:08:21.468-->00:08:26.539
and working with closely with
DefCon management to figure out
the best way forward for next

00:08:26.539-->00:08:33.279
year and as soon as we have an
update we will let you know.
Thanks and cheers

00:08:33.279-->00:08:38.284
[applause][whistling] >>Even
tyrannosaurus rex over here
likes that [laughs]. Okay do we

00:08:48.261-->00:08:52.766
have the info booth? uh hacker
tracker? do we have someone want
to come up and, come on up!

00:08:52.766-->00:08:59.172
Mello, Melloman, head of info
booth [applause] >>This is my
last year too! >>Oh! >>This is

00:08:59.172-->00:09:04.110
my last year as well. [audience
boos] boo. No. Thank you
[laughs] So, I don’t know what

00:09:07.714-->00:09:13.219
my slides look like cause, what
I sent is not this uh [laughs]
so hacker tracker we brought on

00:09:13.219-->00:09:17.891
board last year as an official
DefCon thing, this year we
started expanding it. Uh we got

00:09:17.891-->00:09:22.028
both Android and iOS next year
we’ll have actual a full website
and it will all look the same.

00:09:22.028-->00:09:27.934
That’s my only slide? >>That’s
your only slide. >>Yes, that is
my only slide. >>That’s your

00:09:27.934-->00:09:34.841
only slide [everyone laughs]
>>Hey! Woo! >>Alright so I’m
remembering the numbers, and

00:09:34.841-->00:09:39.846
I’ve had a few drinks. My team
is great. We had something like
8 point six thousand, er eighty

00:09:42.649-->00:09:47.654
six hundred Android users and
about sixty four hundred iOS
users as active users over this

00:09:49.756-->00:09:54.527
weekend so that’s about half of
you out there used hacker
tracker at least once >>Woo!

00:09:54.527-->00:09:59.532
>>Alright so, how many out there
have used Hacker Tracker? >>Woo!
>>I know I have. We also had 7

00:10:05.238-->00:10:09.576
info booths this year. So if you
turned around and didn’t see an
info goon there was probably in

00:10:09.576-->00:10:14.848
the wrong place. Okay, now, how
many of you went to an info
booth, or talked to an info

00:10:14.848-->00:10:19.853
goon, somewhere? >>Woo! >>Sweet.
So looks like we’re actually
doing something decent

00:10:28.261-->00:10:33.266
[laughter] So, thank you, enjoy
the Con, and [applause]
>>Workshops. So those, some of

00:10:38.538-->00:10:42.675
those, you might have noticed,
with the new hotel space at
Linq’s we’ve managed to expand

00:10:42.675-->00:10:47.580
the number of workshops um and
this is something we want to
keep trying to do it’s just

00:10:47.580-->00:10:52.719
logistically takes a lot of work
uh and effort. But I’d like to
introduce the person in charge

00:10:52.719-->00:10:57.724
of workshops [applause] >>Hi
everybody! [applause][speaker
laughs] So, Oh yeah, uh so just

00:11:05.465-->00:11:10.470
out of curiosity, how many of
y'all uh went to a workshop this
year? How many of you tried to

00:11:12.472-->00:11:15.942
register for a workshop this
year? [laughs] Okay, so we might
need some more room? Yeah. Oh

00:11:15.942-->00:11:20.947
ho, b***h um so this year we had
nearly two thousand attendees
registered, this does not

00:11:26.986-->00:11:32.025
include, the folks on the
waitlist, we had about a
hundred, a hundred and fifty

00:11:32.025-->00:11:37.030
folks on waitlist for each
class, um, we went from Thursday
to Saturday uh six concurrent

00:11:41.134-->00:11:46.406
tracks, morning afternoon, four
hours each and we had some
amazing workshops we had folks

00:11:46.406-->00:11:51.044
like Joe Grand, Richard
Henderson, all sorts of
different folks out there,

00:11:51.044-->00:11:57.283
teaching, giving back to the
community, absolutely for free.
>>Woo! >>Yeah [applause] Yay!

00:11:57.283-->00:12:02.221
>>Free is good >>We like free,
right? And, we were in our own
hotel, we had the fourth floor

00:12:05.792-->00:12:10.396
of the Linq all to ourselves,
which is a far cry from when we
were over at Bally’s and we were

00:12:10.396-->00:12:16.803
huddled over and had uh a really
cramped hallway and we made you
guys wear those awful wristbands

00:12:16.803-->00:12:20.907
and we’ll never do that to you
ever again but uh [laughs]
[cheers from audience] woo! And

00:12:20.907-->00:12:24.677
that’s it, so I’m looking
forward to next year and
hopefully we can get more

00:12:24.677-->00:12:30.516
classes out for you and more
folks in them um and improve the
registration process, thank you.

00:12:30.516-->00:12:37.457
>>Right on [applause] >>Woo!
>>Okay, Effffn, it’s the NOC
[applause from audience] woo!

00:12:37.457-->00:12:42.462
What, just one thing I wanna say
is there’s no amount of money in
my back pocket that can afford

00:12:49.502-->00:12:54.507
the amount of bandwidth you want
to use [laughter]. >>So I’m
done. [laughter] How’s it going

00:12:59.145-->00:13:04.083
everyone? Uh here to talk about
the NOC [whoops from audience]
hello okay I have to seed the

00:13:06.919-->00:13:11.924
screen hi so my name is Effffn
and I run the NOC here along
with Mac and as usual I’m gonna

00:13:14.327-->00:13:20.900
go through some statistics and
interesting stuff that we did.
So, we have two kinds of network

00:13:20.900-->00:13:25.905
here, we have the wired and the
wifi, so wifi is mostly for all
of you, across all three

00:13:28.708-->00:13:33.946
properties, and wired is for
everything else that is listed
there, I’m not going to go

00:13:33.946-->00:13:38.951
through this, you can download
uh this presentation for the NOC
later. So this is how the week

00:13:41.721-->00:13:47.994
went, we have the same amount of
days and two more properties to
take care of and we started on

00:13:47.994-->00:13:54.734
Sunday uh basic set up so
whatever is green is good,
orange more or less, and red

00:13:54.734-->00:14:00.740
that that was very hard for us.
But Sunday usually good we work
with the hotel IT people, and

00:14:00.740-->00:14:05.745
the Encore folks, they’re super
awesome and uh was going well
until the time crunch came and

00:14:09.349-->00:14:15.955
more and we had to run around
the properties and get
everything set up so it’s um it

00:14:15.955-->00:14:20.693
was good and then and it worked,
you can go through this later,
uh but there was a lot of

00:14:20.693-->00:14:25.832
patching, there was a lot of
things, when things were coming
up, people couldn’t find cables

00:14:25.832-->00:14:31.037
or cables were not working and
then we shop up they were
working and so on and so forth

00:14:31.037-->00:14:36.042
so uh but the code that we used
[whoop from audience] to know if
things were working or not

00:14:39.712-->00:14:45.084
working was our friend Guy
Fieri, so we had the NOC current
status, had the happy, the

00:14:45.084-->00:14:50.089
desperate, and stellar one.
[laughter]. So. We set up
everything was working despite

00:14:52.892-->00:14:59.365
some problems that I’m gonna
talk a little bit in the next
slide, but you guys show up, we

00:14:59.365-->00:15:04.871
have three hundred megs and Jeff
already addressed what has to be
addressed on how much it costs

00:15:04.871-->00:15:09.876
to to do this a lot of money uh
so you guys showed up, you can
see went straight to 300 meg on

00:15:11.978-->00:15:16.983
Thursday [laughter] and you
never went down [laughter] so
then we went to 350 for about 3

00:15:20.453-->00:15:25.458
hours and we saw that it was
already packed so kindly DT
allowed us to to go to 400 and

00:15:29.262-->00:15:34.267
it stayed there for the whole
week. [applause] As usual we
have some challenges and and and

00:15:40.606-->00:15:45.878
issues other than the unplanned
ones, right? So bandwidth is the
usual one actually uh but some

00:15:45.878-->00:15:51.484
fiber connections they were
acting up on us uh between the
IDF and the MDFs, the IDFs and

00:15:51.484-->00:15:56.489
the MDF um so we had a problem
with uh some switches that we
swapped still s**t didn’t work

00:16:02.261-->00:16:08.234
and then we found out it was a
power issue that half of the,
not half but part of the hotel

00:16:08.234-->00:16:15.208
and the APs were not working um
then we had on Thursday somebody
posted on Twitter, and thank you

00:16:15.208-->00:16:20.213
for that, that Multicast was
leaking on the secure- on the
secure network to the other

00:16:22.281-->00:16:27.520
users that was a configuration
thing we fixed right away but
totally we overlooked that,

00:16:27.520-->00:16:31.824
thanks for reporting your name
is at the end of the
presentation, appreciate that.

00:16:31.824-->00:16:38.197
Um AP coverage and capacity like
this room with all of you right
now the internet is probably not

00:16:38.197-->00:16:43.202
so good but it happens and we
had also new APs uh I'm gonna
talk about that in two slides

00:16:47.907-->00:16:52.912
and people still don’t get 8021X
I don’t blame you cause we have
to fight through this but if you

00:16:56.582-->00:17:01.520
follow the instructions mostly
most of the time it works and
anyhow. So we went for a 10 gig

00:17:04.390-->00:17:09.762
backbone just like last year but
because of the fiber issues we
had to some places go down to

00:17:09.762-->00:17:14.767
one gig uh the internet the
internet uplink I talked about
that already um here at Caesar’s

00:17:17.136-->00:17:23.276
so all the other properties will
talk like layer three to here,
layer layer 3 using IPsec

00:17:23.276-->00:17:29.482
tunnels so everything goes comes
here and then to the internet,
we have one internet uplink.

00:17:29.482-->00:17:34.754
About the wired gear, not gonna
go through this, but pretty much
the core which is the firewell

00:17:34.754-->00:17:39.759
and the core switch and uh the
firewall we had like three of
those, three sets of those.

00:17:44.931-->00:17:49.936
[laughs] >>FreeBSD! >>Free BSD
[audience cheers] As for the
wireless gear we also had to

00:17:53.639-->00:17:58.911
have three three controllers And
that worked well and we got a
bunch more APs to support the

00:17:58.911-->00:18:03.849
three properties thanks Jeff um
so we had a total of 136 APs the
breakdown’s there obviously most

00:18:06.052-->00:18:11.057
of the the APs are here at
Caesar’s. 20 at Flamingo. 6 at
Linq. Not gonna read this but we

00:18:13.125-->00:18:18.030
doubled the amount of traffic
that you guys use so last year
we had about four- uh five point

00:18:18.030-->00:18:23.035
something terabytes, nine point
eleven which is a weird number
to have but um [laughter] but

00:18:25.071-->00:18:31.077
that’s true and up to like a few
hours ago uh and there’s like
some more cool stuff the other

00:18:31.077-->00:18:36.082
cool stuff is that we had
fifteen thousand different uh
unique DHCP leases that means

00:18:38.751-->00:18:43.756
that you guys stopped doing DHCP
exhaustion attacks and we really
appreciate that [laughter] So

00:18:48.961-->00:18:53.666
big shout out to my crew, people
are awesome, they dedicate the
whole week to be here and work

00:18:53.666-->00:18:58.671
hard long hours and drink hard
at night don’t know how we do
this but we pulled this off so

00:19:01.073-->00:19:06.078

00:19:19.125-->00:19:24.130

our fearless leader from the
from the NOC in the previous
life, he still runs our server

00:20:26.859-->00:20:33.032
uh the DefCon networking dot org
so I had to have some stuff done
there and I’m like Lock can you

00:20:33.032-->00:20:38.237
help? And he’s like of course
right? so that’s part of the
DefCon family uh thanks to the

00:20:38.237-->00:20:45.144
bar staff downstairs, that’s
where we spent most of the night
because we didn’t go too far um

00:20:45.144-->00:20:49.181
the usual very nice folks who
come to the NOC and drop snacks
for us, they show up, they

00:20:49.181-->00:20:54.120
started working in the NOC
before, and they know how like
you don’t see anything and

00:20:54.120-->00:20:59.525
people only remember about you
when s***t breaks so they bring
us like a few snacks, thanks for

00:20:59.525-->00:21:04.463
that. All the other DefCon
leaders and goons, thank you so
much like I’m a pain in the a**

00:21:07.333-->00:21:13.539
like to meet deadlines I say I
need your requests by this date,
if it doesn’t, if I don’t get

00:21:13.539-->00:21:18.410
it, it will happen but it will
take longer. Everybody does a
great job like pushing back and

00:21:18.410-->00:21:23.849
saying I really need this by
this date, so thank you very
much okay? And thanks everyone

00:21:23.849-->00:21:28.854
for behaving on the wifi as much
as you can [applause][cheering]
>>Okay this is the first year

00:21:35.127-->00:21:40.766
where DCTV split out and became
its own department, got a
budget, and then spent it all on

00:21:40.766-->00:21:45.771
new equipment >>Woo! >>So, I’d
like to introduce VideoMan
[applause] Hi folks, how’s

00:21:52.344-->00:21:57.349
everybody doing? [applause] who
has a hotel room in Caesar’s,
Linq, Harras, Paris, Bally’s or

00:22:01.020-->00:22:06.025
Flamingo? >>Woo! >>Did any of
you watch the talks today from
your room? Yeah, okay so. I

00:22:10.529-->00:22:15.534
expect more, Geez! We got new
equipment this year um Morgan,
my cohead actually pushed for

00:22:19.505-->00:22:25.978
this which was awesome we also
acquired three more new goons
cause we were just a team of two

00:22:25.978-->00:22:30.983
that were doing all of the TV uh
broadcasting into the the DefCon
hotels. As you can see our our

00:22:34.887-->00:22:38.891
senior overnight program
director is over here on the
right right my right our T-rex

00:22:38.891-->00:22:43.896
program director. [applause]
>>higher! higher! [from
audience] [speaker laughs] >>So

00:22:54.874-->00:23:00.145
I don’t know if you guys got
here and were trying to watch
DCTV Thursday, uh it was only

00:23:00.145-->00:23:06.685
one track. Unfortunately we had
a little bit of problems with
our hardware, not showing up uh

00:23:06.685-->00:23:12.691
we had >>over two months of
work. Trying to get that
hardware. >>Yeah. Two months of

00:23:12.691-->00:23:19.598
work trying to get hardware. Six
shipments that we tried to
receive, didn’t happen. Uh

00:23:19.598-->00:23:24.536
Friday morning I drove 30
minutes north of here to pick up
a bunch of hardware put it in my

00:23:24.536-->00:23:29.775
car and drive it back down on
site within 90 minutes of
receiving that shipment, we had

00:23:29.775-->00:23:35.180
4 of the hotels up and by about
two o’clock we had all 6 hotels
up and running the tracks in

00:23:35.180-->00:23:40.185
your rooms [applause] yeah. And
Jeff, as Jeff points out this
year we’re in high def, right?

00:23:45.090-->00:23:49.695
You can actually see all the
slides, you can see video, in
all the rooms, it’s it’s

00:23:49.695-->00:23:54.700
awesome, it’s superb. And I
would say also say that um,
whoops, our our volunteers,

00:23:59.938-->00:24:05.878
here, our new volunteers were a
big part of that. We could tell
them, hey go do this and like an

00:24:05.878-->00:24:10.883
hour later it’d be done, right?
Dedication and the ability to
just pick up and roll with

00:24:12.985-->00:24:17.990
things is very important.
>>Raise your hand over there.
Thank you! [applause] >>We

00:24:24.296-->00:24:29.668
figured we’re broadcasting to 18
thousand hotel rooms that’s
about probably 22 thousand TVs

00:24:29.668-->00:24:35.974
because some rooms have at least
2 or more TVs. 99 point 9
percent up time there was a

00:24:35.974-->00:24:40.612
little glitch uh Saturday
morning but we figured it out,
people were on the Twitters

00:24:40.612-->00:24:47.086
telling us hey we don’t have
audio. We were able to figure it
out and fix it very quickly. We

00:24:47.086-->00:24:52.091
also streamed DC101 and Track 1
to the internet for the entire
time that they were actually on

00:24:54.193-->00:24:58.897
which was pretty fun uh we
figured out we got about four
thousand viewers online

00:24:58.897-->00:25:03.836
throughout the whole conference
obviously DC101 was very
popular. Alright so if you want

00:25:07.072-->00:25:12.177
DCTV dot defcon dot org is where
the URLs will live when the
conference is running and you

00:25:12.177-->00:25:17.649
can hit us up on Twitter,
DefConTV defcon underscore TV
Thank you. [applause] >>We get

00:25:17.649-->00:25:22.654
up in the morning so you don’t
have to. >>Awww. Okay so we’re
gonna move into uh Zant, do you

00:25:32.598-->00:25:37.603
want to talk about the villages?
Not [laughs] not really. Okay so
this year with the new space we

00:25:40.005-->00:25:45.010
had the opportunity to have a
record number of villages and so
uh that meant Zant had to deal

00:25:48.013-->00:25:52.951
with almost double the amount of
logistics uh requests, and
because a lot of the villages

00:25:52.951-->00:25:59.224
were new the whole process was
new um so it was just a lot of
work, a lot of answering

00:25:59.224-->00:26:03.462
questions, a lot of setting
expectations, and a lot of last
minute room changes as we were

00:26:03.462-->00:26:08.200
trying to figure out what kind
of space uh some of the villages
needed. So what we’re really

00:26:08.200-->00:26:13.505
interested in hearing about is
which villages worked and uh
which ones didn’t and we really

00:26:13.505-->00:26:19.378
want to uh make sure that the
winners have the space and the
resources to thrive so I’d like

00:26:19.378-->00:26:25.050
ta- have Zant have some uh have
some words here [laughs].
>>[applause] Thank you.

00:26:25.050-->00:26:30.622
Hopefully everybody enjoyed the
villages? Uh as DT said we’re a
new division, I wouldn’t have

00:26:30.622-->00:26:34.827
been able to do any of it
without my two leads which were
RunnerUp, Br00zer, and I’d like

00:26:34.827-->00:26:38.797
to thank the entire rest of my
team cause they’re the ones that
made it all possible, they

00:26:38.797-->00:26:44.303
answered all the vis- villages
calls for needs, all I did is
ran the entire weekend, I can

00:26:44.303-->00:26:50.209
honestly say I was so busy
running, I don’t, I did not hit
my final village until uh 2

00:26:50.209-->00:26:54.746
o’clock today so yeah all I
gotta do is say thank you for
you guys, I really didn’t have

00:26:54.746-->00:26:59.985
much else to say. [applause]
>>Your voice is shot >>Yeah,
that’s why I didn’t want to

00:26:59.985-->00:27:04.990
talk, my voice has been gone for
3 days. And yes, I already know,
every village needs more space

00:27:13.765-->00:27:19.004
[laughter] >>Okay, data
duplication village uh they
added talks this year uh and

00:27:19.004-->00:27:24.009
unfortunately we also had some
lost duplicators that reduced
our uh our uh total capacity we

00:27:26.912-->00:27:33.285
wanna nobody’s here? I will talk
about it um so you can just
quickly look at the statistics

00:27:33.285-->00:27:38.724
um infocon archive collection
continues to grow, the
hashtables you can see remain

00:27:38.724-->00:27:43.729
popular. Um and uh we had to
turn away uh we stopped
accepting drives around 450

00:27:46.765-->00:27:51.770
drives we only got to about 350
and some odd drives, 300 one to
three, yeah 319 dupes, um and so

00:27:55.007-->00:27:59.678
next year we’re gonna address
this by repairing the machines
that got damaged, and finding

00:27:59.678-->00:28:04.516
the machines that got lost, um
so it’s really fascinating that
even in this age of high speed

00:28:04.516-->00:28:10.355
internet there’s nothing that
beats a high drive duplicator.
Or an airplane full of hard

00:28:10.355-->00:28:15.360
drives. Okay I’d like to go to
contests and events. Mr.
Grifter. [cheering] >>I don’t

00:28:23.835-->00:28:28.840
know what that was, made me a
little nervous um so hi uh I’m
Grifter the department head for

00:28:31.176-->00:28:36.181
contests and events this year
>>I love you! >>I love you too,
deeply. Um this year we had over

00:28:38.850-->00:28:45.791
50 different contests and events
every year I always say um when
we get up here if you guys have

00:28:45.791-->00:28:51.163
an idea for something that you
wanna do that you just wanna try
out it can be the most absurd

00:28:51.163-->00:28:56.168
thing you can think of but if it
has legs then then we’ll we’ll
add it >>it has legs! [from

00:28:58.437-->00:29:03.375
audience] >>It has legs!
[laughter] fantastic, see. Just
f****n DefCon you know?

00:29:09.548-->00:29:16.455
[laughter] Um so we had we had
42 um actual contests this year,
12 of which were new so you guys

00:29:16.455-->00:29:22.561
really took that to heart last
year I got a ton of uh of
different submissions we took a

00:29:22.561-->00:29:28.166
dozen of the best ones, and most
of that was just due to space I
think we’re collecting all the

00:29:28.166-->00:29:34.439
hotels on the strip like they’re
f****n Pokemon cards now for
DefCon now [laughter] So um so

00:29:34.439-->00:29:40.312
maybe if we got some more room
for additional contests next
year, hit me up uh just send an

00:29:40.312-->00:29:46.251
email to contests at DefCon dot
org and uh and tell us what your
ideas is we’d love to hear it.

00:29:46.251-->00:29:51.256
[applause] Um yeah I guess can
we get a huge huge round of
applause for all the organizers

00:29:54.092-->00:29:59.097
of of the contests and events?
[applause] like they put in a
ridiculous amount of work and we

00:30:09.374-->00:30:14.379
open up the call for contests on
January first so um I guess
that’s when DT thinks I I’ve had

00:30:16.715-->00:30:22.721
enough of the holidays um and my
inbox is what lights up like a
Christmas tree and then they

00:30:22.721-->00:30:26.358
just start hammering me with all
the requests to try to make
things the best they possibly

00:30:26.358-->00:30:32.297
can for you so um so I really
appreciate the effort and I hope
you guys do to um there’s way

00:30:32.297-->00:30:37.169
too many to go through
individually um so I’m just
gonna skip it and we’ll come

00:30:37.169-->00:30:42.174
back in a second for the for
those black badge events.
[applause] >>This year um for

00:30:46.578-->00:30:53.585
vendors we had it’s like we have
more space but it got absorbed
very quickly, it was crowded in

00:30:53.585-->00:30:59.891
the vendor space and here are a
list of uh the vendors and what
we’re noticing is this year is

00:30:59.891-->00:31:04.429
the first year we noticed um we
had to turn away some vendors
that wanted to provide cloud

00:31:04.429-->00:31:09.868
servicy things and we really had
to explain to people no you need
to be sort of part of the

00:31:09.868-->00:31:15.240
community, you’ve got to engage
with the community somehow, not
just show up and give away a

00:31:15.240-->00:31:21.346
free cloud log in to your
vulnerability scanning platform
and uh and that pissed off some

00:31:21.346-->00:31:27.686
people but if you can’t yeah
good! If you can’t show up and
engage with the community uh

00:31:27.686-->00:31:33.091
we’d rather have empty tables
than full tables and so we’re
always on the lookout [applause]

00:31:33.091-->00:31:38.096
[speaker laughs] so I had this
uh epiphany it was and I forget
who it wasn’t really my epiphany

00:31:43.869-->00:31:48.073
I I read it somewhere and I
can’t remember where I read it
but it was essentially a report

00:31:48.073-->00:31:51.810
was talking about their
experience at DefCon in the
vendor area and they said bring

00:31:51.810-->00:31:55.914
a lot of cash because you’re
gonna wanna buy all the stuff
that you don’t ever want to show

00:31:55.914-->00:32:02.754
up in your Amazon shopping cart
history [laughter] And I was
like, exactly. We need to find

00:32:02.754-->00:32:07.993
those vendors and get them to
DefCon because we don’t want
them in your Amazon shopping

00:32:07.993-->00:32:12.998
cart so if you can think of
dodgy interesting vendors
[laughter] send them our way

00:32:20.605-->00:32:24.109
[off mic shouting indiscernible]
Okay let’s hear from the the
arts and entertainment, do we

00:32:24.109-->00:32:30.348
have? Do we have the arts and
entertainment here? [cheers]
come on guys! Artists, entert-

00:32:30.348-->00:32:35.620
okay I’m gonna try to wing it
They’re still asleep, oh that’s
right. Um besides the roof

00:32:35.620-->00:32:40.625
coming down for the second year
in a row uh during the fat base
of Juno Reactor last night um

00:32:43.862-->00:32:50.035
you can see our lineup this year
we always try to have a really
community driven track of

00:32:50.035-->00:32:55.440
artists from the community and
then we also try to find some
cool either retro or or current

00:32:55.440-->00:33:00.378
acts that you might not normally
uh uh come across and we wanna
expose you to and uh and then we

00:33:02.447-->00:33:07.452
also try to release every year
an audio- a music track or CD or
original soundtrack so by show

00:33:09.921-->00:33:14.092
of hands how many people
appreciate or actually ever
listen to the DefCon music CD?

00:33:14.092-->00:33:19.097
>>Woo! [cheering] >>Woo! Okay
yeah these people donate their
music to us we we compile it we

00:33:21.499-->00:33:28.206
master it and then it ends up
going up uh for sale with the
proceeds going to the EFF and um

00:33:28.206-->00:33:32.811
and we just plan to keep doing
this until you guys stop caring
because I think it’s cool

00:33:32.811-->00:33:38.316
there's really an intersection
between sort of the culture and
music and you can see that by

00:33:38.316-->00:33:44.656
the number of bands and DJs uh
and acts that we have at DefCon
um this year Juno Reactor was

00:33:44.656-->00:33:51.429
awesome, how many people managed
to see Juno Reactor? [cheer]
yeah. So this was a big growing,

00:33:51.429-->00:33:57.836
this was like the biggest name
band that we’ve ever done and
boy [laughs] did we learn a lot.

00:33:57.836-->00:34:02.774
I mean not you might not have
realized it but that lighting
setup was fantastic, it was

00:34:06.211-->00:34:10.782
fantastic because it was like a
whole project in and of itself,
just to get the lighting setup,

00:34:10.782-->00:34:15.787
uh corporate accounts to get uh
CO2 cylinders to fire off smoke
things. Did you realize that the

00:34:20.025-->00:34:25.030
misting machine, is the same as
the smoke and it will set off
fire suppression systems?

00:34:27.632-->00:34:34.205
[laughter] right? So you have to
have fire trucks ready in the
parking lot when you turn off

00:34:34.205-->00:34:39.077
the fire suppression system and
a fire person standing there
making sure it’s not really on

00:34:39.077-->00:34:45.951
fire and it’s just like thing
after thing after thing just for
some guys to get up on stage and

00:34:45.951-->00:34:49.821
rock it and so I was so happy
that everybody got to enjoy Juno
Reactor and all I saw was like

00:34:49.821-->00:34:51.823
fire suppression, smoke
detector, you know [laughter] it
was crazy I just I just I just

00:34:51.823-->00:34:53.825
wanna and the other thing that
was super cool about Juno
Reactor is they gave us

00:34:53.825-->00:34:58.830
permission to record it so we’re
gonna release it [applause] yeah
that’s really cool. Every one of

00:35:10.208-->00:35:16.748
the other big performers have
these writers that say we can’t
record it we can’t think about

00:35:16.748-->00:35:21.419
recording it you know where Juno
Reactor is fantastic to work
with so we’re gonna try to work

00:35:21.419-->00:35:26.424
with bands in the future that
allow us to record it and
release it [applause] Okay

00:35:30.428-->00:35:35.600
Pyr0s, anybody wanna come up and
talk about the parties? So
parties spun out this year also

00:35:35.600-->00:35:40.038
in it’s own department because
we had multiple properties and
so much going on so I’d like to

00:35:40.038-->00:35:44.175
introduce Pyr0 and his team
[applause] >>How’s it going
everybody, did you have a good

00:35:44.175-->00:35:49.180
DefCon? [cheers] excellent. So I
I’ve worked with DefCon now this
is like my 19th year uh 20 years

00:35:53.151-->00:35:59.424
going on but 19 years on staff
and I always just have Jeff like
bounce me around in different

00:35:59.424-->00:36:03.161
places where he wants me and
last year he came at the end of
Con I told him I wanted to come

00:36:03.161-->00:36:07.465
back and I wanted to contribute
and participate again and he
said that the big goal that they

00:36:07.465-->00:36:14.205
wanted to do with this new
department was bring back the
feel of the old DefCon parties,

00:36:14.205-->00:36:19.878
Alexis Park days, you guys, who
was there? [cheering] you
remember what it was like and

00:36:19.878-->00:36:26.551
that’s what we wanted to
recreate this year so I have a
small staff and uh they are

00:36:26.551-->00:36:32.457
exceptional uh right here
existence was our number 1, most
departments have a department

00:36:32.457-->00:36:38.997
head and a second, he is by far
the number 1 this man did almost
all of the actual labor and work

00:36:38.997-->00:36:45.236
to make this stuff happen this
year so I’m gonna hand it over
to him but thank you very much

00:36:45.236-->00:36:50.241
[applause] >>[off mic
indiscernible] pools >>[laughs]
so how many of you guys came out

00:36:55.046-->00:37:00.385
to the parties that was not here
at Caesar’s other than hacker
karaoke and a couple smaller

00:37:00.385-->00:37:05.390
ones but over in Flamingo?
[cheering] Awesome. We’re hoping
to make it bigger, badder, and

00:37:08.359-->00:37:14.866
better next year unfortunately
the 3oh3 pool party had to get
moved inside due to safety uh so

00:37:14.866-->00:37:19.471
we apologize that we couldn’t
throw the large pool party we
wanted to throw, hopefully next

00:37:19.471-->00:37:25.877
year that will all happen and
you guys can come out, swim and
drink and party. [applause] So

00:37:25.877-->00:37:31.316
feel free to contact us we’re
parties and we’ll make it happen
and uh we’ll get it out there,

00:37:31.316-->00:37:36.321
thanks very much guys
[applause]. >>Okay so we’re into
the part where we’re talking

00:37:42.093-->00:37:47.098
about black badge contests so
this is this is this year’s
black badge and uh I’ll just

00:37:49.200-->00:37:54.272
tell you a quick little story
about the black badge uh for
this year uh it’s electronic and

00:37:54.272-->00:37:59.277
it’s also analog and uh the it
has a parts in it that have been
reclaimed uh electronic

00:38:02.280-->00:38:08.686
components uh from the apollo
ground station tracking stations
from back in the day some of

00:38:08.686-->00:38:13.525
that stuff got surplussed people
took the components off and some
of its ending up on the black

00:38:13.525-->00:38:18.029
badge. Also I’m gonna have up
right here on the stage later
after we’re over in case we’re

00:38:18.029-->00:38:24.135
interested I wanted to create
like how much more black can it
be? I tried, I tried to get the

00:38:24.135-->00:38:29.474
blackest black and uh the
blackest black is a black called
uh Vantablack and it absorbs all

00:38:29.474-->00:38:32.911
visible frequencies um but uh
you can’t get that sorry
[laughter] so the next best

00:38:32.911-->00:38:37.916
black is another black um that’s
really really expensive for
every ounce of this paint and so

00:38:45.490-->00:38:51.596
uh the TYMKRS who designed this
bought an ounce of this super
black ink and we painted it and

00:38:51.596-->00:38:56.601
we compared it to just like
black PCB not really that
different [laughter] so you’ll

00:38:59.204-->00:39:02.941
see the sided by side comparison
but we’re like ah we don't
really want to spend that much

00:39:02.941-->00:39:06.277
money for something where you
can where you can’t unless I
told you that, you would never

00:39:06.277-->00:39:12.650
know. Um so that’s why maybe in
the future if we can work
something out we might try to

00:39:12.650-->00:39:19.457
get a Vantablack that would be
super cool um so black badges
get you in for life uh they’re

00:39:19.457-->00:39:25.096
generally uh they’re always
given to the winning team of
capture the flag and then after

00:39:25.096-->00:39:31.736
that it’s really questionable
who gets to win them. We vary it
by contest uh Grifter makes the

00:39:31.736-->00:39:37.709
call uh on who gets the contest
who gets one based on the
quality the amount of effort

00:39:37.709-->00:39:42.647
that goes into the technical
complexity uh and so I’m gonna
hand it over to him to start

00:39:42.647-->00:39:47.652
talking about the badges and
start handing them out. So
Grifter, Grifter. [applause].

00:39:50.588-->00:39:55.593
>>Trevor! >>Trevor, little
buddy. Um alright so uh so as
Jeff mentioned we the black

00:40:00.865-->00:40:07.071
badges are are something that
you go to contests to put
exceptional work in that doesn’t

00:40:07.071-->00:40:12.076
mean that the other contests do
s**t work um we have only a
handful we do that on purpose to

00:40:16.180-->00:40:22.220
make it special, we also do it
so that you don’t know what
competition is going to have a

00:40:22.220-->00:40:28.159
black badge that year, we want
you to compete in the contest
that is, you know, your

00:40:28.159-->00:40:35.099
favorite, that is the technology
that you like or um frankly the
s**t show that you enjoy the

00:40:35.099-->00:40:40.104
most [laughter] and so so you
never know what’s gonna have a
black badge outside of um the

00:40:43.041-->00:40:48.046
CTF so we have uh a handful and
those get picked and no one
knows until literally four hours

00:40:53.284-->00:40:59.524
ago so not even the organizers
know um I’m gonna start bringing
them up and they’re gonna start

00:40:59.524-->00:41:05.596
telling you what their
contestants did to earn those.
So first, Hack the planet, HACK

00:41:05.596-->00:41:10.601
THE PLANET! [cheering] >>I’m uh
really really excited to be able
to say Hack the Planet on a

00:41:14.372-->00:41:19.377
DefCon stage with a dinosaur in
my ear. Um I’m Beau Woods of ICS
village on behalf of the other

00:41:22.413-->00:41:24.415
founding members Bryson Bort, uh
Tom Van Norman, and uh Larry
Vandenaweele uh I’m really

00:41:24.415-->00:41:26.417
really excited to be here to

one C3 non profit educational
organization we wanna have

00:41:52.176-->00:41:56.848
experiential learning and learn
by doing basically we wanna get
s**t done and not go out and

00:41:56.848-->00:42:01.786
spread a bunch of fud right? So
woo so this year we had uh some
really cool stuff down there if

00:42:04.255-->00:42:08.126
you didn’t get over there we had
a simulated water treatment
facility, we had a simulated

00:42:08.126-->00:42:13.998
power plant, we had a bunch of
cool stuff uh and our CTF
obviously called uh Hack the

00:42:13.998-->00:42:19.003
Planet, hack the planet. Um
>>Hack the planet! >>Hack the
planet! >>So we had uh over a

00:42:23.574-->00:42:28.045
hundred different flags that we
could run in this so we had over
a hundred different people

00:42:28.045-->00:42:34.085
participating uh it was really
really cool uh we did a bunch of
stuff we had uh ICS-rex as we

00:42:34.085-->00:42:39.490
nicknamed him next year um we’re
we’re gonna be back, we’re gonna
be doing this again, hopefully

00:42:39.490-->00:42:44.028
we’ll get another black badge,
uh we’re gonna do it even better
and we’ll have twice as much

00:42:44.028-->00:42:49.033
monster so our winners this year
uh it was a really hard fought
race but we’ve got a couple that

00:42:51.502-->00:42:57.608

[applause] Thank you, hack the

00:43:31.309-->00:43:36.314
planet! >>Woo! [applause]
[laughter] >>Spoilers. Alright
this is uh a first year contest

00:43:41.052-->00:43:45.122
but they put a significant
amount of effort into it, you
may have seen people wandering

00:43:45.122-->00:43:50.294
around with the NPC, hello my
name is NPC on their shirts uh
so they included a bunch of

00:43:50.294-->00:43:55.299
other folks in the contest
itself and made them not only
you know folks that were

00:43:55.299-->00:44:00.538
competing but you could also
participate as as part of the
contest so I thought that was

00:44:00.538-->00:44:05.543
really cool, so welcome to the
stage, Dungeons at DefCon.
[applause] >>Thanks DefCon. Um

00:44:08.045-->00:44:13.050
so DnD was uh Dungeons and
Dragons kind of inspired,
multi-layer, crypto interactive

00:44:22.093-->00:44:28.466
puzzle campaign contest so the
uh the teams were competing in
all these various side quests

00:44:28.466-->00:44:33.638
that included crypto puzzles all
sorts of cool things,
interacting with NPCs and then

00:44:33.638-->00:44:38.042
they all had to coalesce
together and solve this main
quest puzzle uh where they were

00:44:38.042-->00:44:44.415
trying to identify a a wizard
that was taking over DefCon
played by Grifter [laughter] um

00:44:44.415-->00:44:49.420
our teams did a fantastic job we
ended up having to turn away
like 30 teams we capped

00:44:52.623-->00:44:58.296
registration at 38 um amazing
turnout we were so proud of
everyone that competed. We had

00:44:58.296-->00:45:04.101
some people do amazing things uh
one of the guys IAF ended up
flooding his hotel room trying

00:45:04.101-->00:45:09.273
to steam open a letter that he
had to figure out what’s inside
without letting us know he had

00:45:09.273-->00:45:14.278
gotten into it. We had another
team that built a paper enigma
machine to try and solve a

00:45:16.447-->00:45:21.452
puzzle that had absolutely
nothing to do with enigma
[laughter]. But mad style there,

00:45:24.889-->00:45:29.894
they confirmed with the crypto
privacy village that it actually
functioned, so mad props there

00:45:32.964-->00:45:37.969
[applause] our, our winning team
though I mean, wow first of all
two R00tz asylum veterans so

00:45:43.241-->00:45:48.346
[applause] that lets you know
the caliber of people that are
coming out of that village man,

00:45:48.346-->00:45:53.351
watch out for these kids, um
they just destroyed things it
was amazing um and they have one

00:45:56.020-->00:46:00.958
of the coolest names I thought
so our winning team, Murder
Hobos [laughter]

00:46:25.449-->00:46:28.252
[cheering][whistling] >>What I
like about a couple of kids
winning a black badge is how

00:46:28.252-->00:46:33.257
much it’s gonna cost Jeff
[laughter] [cheering] for life
baby! >>Can we get it to the

00:46:38.362-->00:46:43.367
oldest member? >>[laughs] the
oldest guy, he looks pale. Oh
that’s all of us. Alright um

00:46:48.172-->00:46:53.844
these guys took a break last
year and we missed them
incredibly um so we reached out

00:46:53.844-->00:46:59.417
and we’re like are you guys
coming back? And they were like,
yeah we missed you too and so uh

00:46:59.417-->00:47:04.355
so back they came and they were
swamped the entire time uh the
contest area was open so uh

00:47:06.724-->00:47:11.729
let’s hear how they did it, Open
CTF [applause] >>So open CTF was
a collaboration this year

00:47:19.837-->00:47:24.842
between Vand and DC562 we had a
great turnout and would like to
thank Grifter and the entire

00:47:27.111-->00:47:33.050
contests staff for keeping the
area at a reasonable volume
between the hours of nine am and

00:47:33.050-->00:47:38.055
nine pm [laughs] the contestants
who played Open CTF ranged from
complete beginners to previous

00:47:40.524-->00:47:47.398
DefCon CT winners. In order to
win Open CTF your team needs to
have depth across multiple

00:47:47.398-->00:47:52.403
technology disciplines including
binary reversal, cryptography,
web hacking, networking and

00:47:55.940-->00:48:01.545
forensics. Our teams
demonstrated that skill over two
days, hacking through several

00:48:01.545-->00:48:07.051
dozen challenges, with the
contest being neck and neck
until the last hour Saturday

00:48:07.051-->00:48:12.990
night. In keeping with the
principles of Open CTF we would
like to call out the three teams

00:48:12.990-->00:48:17.995
that submitted the best right
ups, BotchSec, Girls Taking
Over, and Donkey Kick [applause]

00:48:26.771-->00:48:31.208
We will be retweeting and and
posting those write ups so you
can if you’re new to CTFs you

00:48:31.208-->00:48:36.213
can take a look at those. And
for our top 3 teams, in third
place we had Ghost of Brittney.

00:48:41.652-->00:48:46.657
For second place we have an Open
CTF regular and previous winner
from Seattle, Neg9 [applause]

00:48:52.096-->00:48:57.101
they had a we we released the
source code to our scoreboard
about four hours before the game

00:48:57.101-->00:49:02.039
ended and challenged the teams
to hack it they they actually
did and and claimed those points

00:49:04.508-->00:49:11.415
uh which put them into first
place with about an hour left.
Unfortunately for them uh

00:49:11.415-->00:49:16.420
another team uh scored at the
end and to introduce our winners
who were previous third place

00:49:18.856-->00:49:23.861
finishers of Open CTF from
Europe, NotProblem [applause]
>>Thank you so much! >>Glad to

00:49:30.334-->00:49:35.339
have you back >>Oh, thank you so
much >>We’re a team! >>Wow, you
guys. Congratulations. That way

00:49:48.219-->00:49:53.224
>>Over there >>Oh my sweet sweet
hadnagy [cheering] They need no
introduction, social engineering

00:50:03.234-->00:50:09.440
CTF [cheering] >>Okay we got
some stats for ya. And we had
almost double the space this

00:50:09.440-->00:50:13.944
year, that was pretty awesome
huh? [cheering] that was really
awesome but you guys still

00:50:13.944-->00:50:19.817
waited 3 hours in line so sorry
about that uh really shoutout to
my team man these guys are just

00:50:19.817-->00:50:24.822
awesome aren’t they? Anyone who
visited the village, come on,
they’re awesome [applause] Okay

00:50:28.926-->00:50:34.265
here’s some stats on the
competition. Uh the contestants
spent over six hundred and

00:50:34.265-->00:50:39.570
eighty hours in doing osent just
for the competition in the three
weeks prior to handing their

00:50:39.570-->00:50:46.410
reports in which constituted
four hundred and fifty six pages
of osent that we had to review

00:50:46.410-->00:50:51.615
uh before they can get in the
booth to make their call which
is just ridiculous um two

00:50:51.615-->00:50:57.354
hundred and eighty minutes of
calls were made during the SE
CTF um just over the last two

00:50:57.354-->00:51:02.893
days and we played forty hours
of clutch in the village so I
think that’s the best statistic

00:51:02.893-->00:51:08.032
of all if you ask me um one
quick story if I have just
thirty seconds the best story so

00:51:08.032-->00:51:14.838
far of SE CTF this year um some
contestant uh got a company JB
Hunt and they’re supposed to do

00:51:14.838-->00:51:20.978
a little research to get numbers
to call, and he did research and
found a person called JB Hunt

00:51:20.978-->00:51:23.747
but he didn’t know it was a
person because when he checked
the number if it was real the

00:51:23.747-->00:51:28.319
guy answered JB Hunt so he hung
up because you’re not supposed
to communicate before the CTF

00:51:28.319-->00:51:32.723
and he called this guy and the
guy answered JB Hunt and he was
like you got three minutes of

00:51:32.723-->00:51:37.161
time? And he’s like I’m watching
the cubs game, I’ll give you two
minutes [laughter] and we’re

you may be saying what? He’s an
ugly woman [laughter] that’s

00:52:45.763-->00:52:50.768
because Whitney Maxwell who won

landslide, she couldn’t make it

00:52:54.405-->00:52:59.910
she had to travel home so uh
Patrick is here uh accepting the
the things for her so what we

00:52:59.910-->00:53:04.848
have for Whitney super special,
super special I hope she likes
bourbon, this is a TX Brand

00:53:07.484-->00:53:12.423
bourbon it’s been customized by
human hacker and something
really cool this is the first

00:53:12.423-->00:53:17.428
year SE CTF T-shirt, I had one
left we sent it to them and they
made it into a cap for for the

00:53:19.663-->00:53:24.668
bottle so yeah this is an SE CTF
T-shirt, that’s for Whitney
[applause]Get the awesome uh

00:53:30.474-->00:53:36.146
human head, human hacker award
for being the first place and
this is our 9th year doing this

00:53:36.146-->00:53:43.053
so we’ve got number 9 challenge
coin for Whitney too [applause]
and then you know Whitney’s not

00:53:43.053-->00:53:47.591
here so maybe I should just hold
on to this for her just just
sayin, no I won’t do that. And

00:53:47.591-->00:53:52.596

can wh wh what are you pointing

00:54:12.983-->00:54:17.988
at? Alright um so you may have
seen these guys before they’ve
put together one hell of a

00:54:19.990-->00:54:24.995
competition um obviously IoT is
something that we hear about day
in day out and they setup um

00:54:28.465-->00:54:33.804
essentially a gauntlet of
ridiculousness for their
attendees to jump through um

00:54:33.804-->00:54:40.043
they leave educated and then sad
about the world [laughter] um
I’ll let them tell you why, so

00:54:40.043-->00:54:45.048
hopelessly broken [applause]
>>Alright, hello everyone. I’m
so happy to be here, this is

00:54:57.161-->00:55:03.500
what our third? >>Yep >>Okay
it’s our third black badge, it’s
really awesome to be here, um we

00:55:03.500-->00:55:08.739
had a crazy contest this year uh
we were tracking some of the
targets that were being attacked

00:55:08.739-->00:55:14.912
and we got up to about fifty one
thousand uh attacks launched on
our network so that’s really

00:55:14.912-->00:55:20.083
impressive so thanks to everyone
who played and contributed to
that onslaught um I wanna give a

00:55:20.083-->00:55:25.222
round of applause to everyone
who played so in third place

[indiscernible off mic comments]
>>Twenty Two >>Twenty two
devices, so they got they they

00:55:52.549-->00:55:58.622
pwned all twenty two devices but
they came in second because they
did not own them first, so that

00:55:58.622-->00:56:03.560
was Pwnie IP, so round of
applause to them. [applause] Now

and a half days of challenge.
Our part- participants they were

released a very special

00:59:16.853-->00:59:21.858
challenge which is a DefCon
special, we had the teams uh had
a had to chug down a beer in ten

00:59:25.262-->00:59:31.468
seconds for three thousand
points [laughter] so four teams
participated, uh two teams won

00:59:31.468-->00:59:37.307
and two teams lost [laughter] so
the two teams that lost had to
lose three thousand points as

00:59:37.307-->00:59:42.312
well, and our leader which was
the winner they lost their lead
yesterday after two days lead

00:59:45.415-->00:59:50.420
but eventually today morning
they took back the lead and they
are the first place yep so

00:59:56.126-->01:00:01.131
[applause] yep so I’ll just
announce our uh top three
places, the third place was

01:00:04.000-->01:00:09.005

second place was uh No Country,

01:00:11.508-->01:00:16.513
they had about twenty five
thousand points, and the first
place we have CTF SG with with

01:00:19.583-->01:00:24.588

01:00:38.468-->01:00:43.473
and also the black badge goes to
them they have been playing non
stop for two and a half days uh

01:00:46.142-->01:00:51.147
I personally see them done the
work and they are really very
persistent in trying to hack our

01:00:54.784-->01:00:59.789
simulations. [applause] So
[cheering] and also since this
is the first time we’re brought

01:01:07.631-->01:01:13.737
uh we have uh held the CTF in
DefCon so we actually are being
uh we are very honored to be

01:01:13.737-->01:01:17.574
standing here on stage at the
closing ceremony so we’d like to
thank everyone that

01:01:17.574-->01:01:23.647
participated, came to our booth,
and also Grifter, Brian and all
the other goons again, thank

01:01:23.647-->01:01:28.652
you. [applause] >>[laughs]
Alright uh I’m I love this
contest, so these guys um put

01:01:46.236-->01:01:51.441
together uh a bunch of mini
games and essentially it’s I
mean it’s a c it’s it’s a a a a

01:01:51.441-->01:01:57.180
bunch of points from all these
different things so if you suck
at one thing you can redeem

01:01:57.180-->01:02:02.352
yourself somewhere else uh and I
think that’s great because it’s
uh sometimes you go into a CTF

01:02:02.352-->01:02:08.191
and you just feel beat down you
don’t uh you hit something that
you can’t get past and then

01:02:08.191-->01:02:13.296
you’re stuck forever, uh this
makes sure that that doesn’t
happen and uh and I love that

01:02:13.296-->01:02:17.434
about these guys they’ve been on
this stage many times before and
here they are again, Warlock

01:02:17.434-->01:02:22.439
Games [applause]. >>Alright good
afternoon DefCon um you know you
get to that point where uh

01:02:32.616-->01:02:37.721
Redbull uh just isn’t enough
anymore right? You need to find
a different energy drink so if

01:02:37.721-->01:02:42.726
anybody’s got ideas let us know.
Um it’s been a long weekend
>>Rondo! >>Rondo. So um [laughs]

01:02:45.829-->01:02:50.834
yes. So this is our fifth year
um coming to DefCon as a contest
and standing here on the stage

01:02:53.603-->01:02:59.242
uh for our third black badge is
just as humbling as receiving
the first so we’re very

01:02:59.242-->01:03:04.981
appreciable and uh honored to be
here, special thanks to uh Dark
Tangent, Grifter, and uh and

01:03:04.981-->01:03:11.888
Darrell. So we started Friday at
eleven AM and uh ended Sunday at
twelve. We actually extended it

01:03:11.888-->01:03:16.426
two hours uh so that we could
get the last bit of points in
there. So the kinds of things

01:03:16.426-->01:03:20.497
that we do, are the things that
you’d expect in the CTF there’s
the binaries, the reverse

01:03:20.497-->01:03:25.101
engineering, the web, and the
challenges that these guys had
to go after this year dealt with

01:03:25.101-->01:03:29.372
the global government cyber
security enforcement agency,
because we all wanna hack the

01:03:29.372-->01:03:35.211
government right? Um so they had
to go against those guys and Tor
bought enterprises uh as part of

01:03:35.211-->01:03:40.483
their web services. They had uh
to reverse engineer binaries
which were authentication tokens

01:03:40.483-->01:03:45.488
for the uh gov sec dot agency uh
so that was the onboard items.
Then we had things at the table

01:03:47.557-->01:03:51.895
the physical security side
right? So they had the lockpicks
that they had to go after and if

01:03:51.895-->01:03:55.465
you didn’t do so well at
lockpicking you could always
jump on the end of the table and

01:03:55.465-->01:04:00.070
play a few rounds of Fortnite
any Fortnite players out here?
[sparse cheer] Yeah a couple.

01:04:00.070-->01:04:06.743
Not my game uh but uh you know
my my uh youngest son could
probably uh he definitely uh has

01:04:06.743-->01:04:13.450
it. Um so we uh offered a lot of
different points uh we even had
a t-shirts uh for a DefCon26, we

01:04:13.450-->01:04:17.954
always uh get a t-shirt going
this year had a puzzle on it as
well so even if you didn’t do

01:04:17.954-->01:04:21.191
anything with all the other
challenges you could at least
solve that and get some points

01:04:21.191-->01:04:26.763
on the board um so our third
place team scored two thousand
three hundred fifty points uh

01:04:26.763-->01:04:32.602
and they actually led a good
portion of the way which was uh
uh pretty impressive. They’re a

01:04:32.602-->01:04:38.541
team uh out of uh Europe
somewhere [laughter] um we won’t
specify exactly where they’re

01:04:38.541-->01:04:44.180
from or who they are but uh
we’ve seen them before and uh
they played a fantastic game uh

01:04:44.180-->01:04:50.120
that was uh Dank Memes uh I
think they may have already
departed. Um our second place

01:04:50.120-->01:04:55.225
team with two thousand four
hundred and twenty five points
was Ambush and uh they played a

01:04:55.225-->01:05:01.498
phenomenal game as well and the
lead actually swapped within the
last hour of the game, our first

01:05:01.498-->01:05:06.503
place team PTFS with two
thousand five hundred and fifty
points >>Woo! [applause] what

01:05:12.308-->01:05:17.313
does that even meme? [laughter]
>>DefCon thank you very much and
we look forward to seeing you

01:05:22.786-->01:05:27.791
next year! [applause]
>>Congratulations >>Shaking your
head no? Don’t shake your head

01:05:39.202-->01:05:44.207
no, just get up here, Wireless
CTF [applause] >>Hey DefCon, so
we’re back again, I think this

01:05:53.016-->01:05:56.820
is our thirteenth year running
the uh wireless village and
we’re super psyched we got more

01:05:56.820-->01:06:02.125
space this year, thank you guys,
appreciate it, we really do. Um
every year we try to make some

01:06:02.125-->01:06:07.130
changes, and this year we did.
Um we had over twenty foxes go
out over the course of the Con

01:06:09.465-->01:06:14.170
which meant that our guys that
were doing well, I’m getting
books thrown at me >>Yep >>Wow,

01:06:14.170-->01:06:17.674
um the guys that were doing well
and the gals that were doing
well were up for twenty four

01:06:17.674-->01:06:22.345
hours a day for three days
straight, the foxes were twenty
four seven, when they went to

01:06:22.345-->01:06:28.551
sleep, they became hide and
seeks, we also partnered thanks
to HighWizz with the Furries. So

01:06:28.551-->01:06:35.558
we actually had foxes that were
foxes [laughter] [cheers] yeah
that happened quite a bit and

01:06:35.558-->01:06:40.563
thanks to Renderman I must say
there was a IOD fox if you don’t
know what that is, it was a butt

01:06:43.700-->01:06:49.405
plug that was walking throughout
the conference inserted and
being spoken to during the

01:06:49.405-->01:06:56.145
course of the uh village
[laughter] I’ll let that one
sink in literally [laughter].

01:06:56.145-->01:07:02.418
>>Where?! >>So so that being
said, we had one team that came
back, uh came over uh from the

01:07:02.418-->01:07:08.324
east coast with us comically
speaking um and they just tore
it up so software defined radio,

01:07:08.324-->01:07:13.329
wifi bluetooth, we’re doing full
on unbeakoning bluetooth
tracking on a phone and they

01:07:15.365-->01:07:19.702
were extremely successful with
it so I want to bring up the
Majestic Twelve oh one other

01:07:19.702-->01:07:24.007
thing real quick so we had one
other to- one other contest that
was new this year, we had King

01:07:24.007-->01:07:27.777
of the Hill, we’ve been trying
to do it for many many years, we
had a router running twenty four

01:07:27.777-->01:07:33.850
seven, it was up for fifty one
hours, forty eight of those
hours there was connections

01:07:33.850-->01:07:39.422
every minute we had three hours
of down time for the entire
conference of people trying to

01:07:39.422-->01:07:44.160
attack it, so we’ve just we’ve
expanded quite a bit and we’ve
done a whole lot, we’ve got some

01:07:44.160-->01:07:48.731
amazing sponsors, and now we’ve
got a black badge, so Majestic
Twelve >>Thank you [applause]

01:07:48.731-->01:07:53.736
>>I don’t wanna give this away,
it’s sickening >>I’ll just have
a couple quick words and that’s

01:07:56.039-->01:08:00.977
just basically just install and
pinto that’s [laughter][sparse
applause] >>Thank you [laughter]

01:08:05.715-->01:08:10.720
>>Thank you! >>Good job, I’m
surprised you’re still awake
that’s pretty impressive.

01:08:22.098-->01:08:28.371
>>Alright so these next guys uh
come out of Packet Capture
Village um [woo from audience]

01:08:28.371-->01:08:33.376
woo! Yeah um I I also like
packets um so a couple of years
ago they asked well how do we

01:08:36.879-->01:08:41.317
become a black badge contest?
And they had multiple contests
that were going on in there and

01:08:41.317-->01:08:44.854
I said well all of these
contests only take a couple
hours for the attendees to

01:08:44.854-->01:08:49.392
compete in so what what we want
for a black badge contest is
something that you really have

01:08:49.392-->01:08:55.465
to invest time in you hear about
these contests where people
compete all weekend or for some

01:08:55.465-->01:09:00.670
twenty four or thirty six hour
stretch so we were um we were
discussing it and they were like

01:09:00.670-->01:09:04.974
okay I think we can make it
harder and then a couple of
years ago they just combined

01:09:04.974-->01:09:09.979
every contest they had into one
mega voltron like contest um for
some reason they haven’t stopped

01:09:13.983-->01:09:20.089
making it harder [laughter] so
every year they just up their
game and up their game and this

01:09:20.089-->01:09:25.595
year it was difficult enough to
knock out um some really
vetering competitors so I think

01:09:25.595-->01:09:30.600
they may have found the right
spot so uh up here to talk about
it, Capture the Packet

01:09:35.972-->01:09:40.977
[applause] >>Hey everyone uh
this year Packet Hacking Village
was insane I want to thank the

01:09:45.014-->01:09:50.319
uh DefCon staff it was an
awesome space um one thing we uh
we kind of noticed you know in

01:09:50.319-->01:09:56.592
in the terms of villages and uh
anything under a thousand is a
village anything over that is a

01:09:56.592-->01:10:01.898
town, and I think we’ve hit town
[laughs] cause we’re crushed in
that space again, how many of

01:10:01.898-->01:10:06.102
you were at the packet hacking
village at one point ra- by
raise of hands? [cheering]

01:10:06.102-->01:10:11.107
Alright! So um thanks again it
was an amazing space um we wanna
thank all of our volunteers they

01:10:14.277-->01:10:19.315
the people that made it happen
we had over a hundred volunteers
our ops crew that nobody sees

01:10:19.315-->01:10:23.920
but makes it happen in the
background uh Vbox and
Prederation and all the the

01:10:23.920-->01:10:30.827
leads that were there, my my
partner in crime CDox just was
awesome um so this year we we

01:10:30.827-->01:10:36.833
changed it up a little bit so to
make it so that more people
compete could compete in capture

01:10:36.833-->01:10:41.938
the packet what we did was we
made three events, So we had
packet inspector where you never

01:10:41.938-->01:10:46.676
touched anything before, you
wanna try, you sit down you
play, then we made packet

01:10:46.676-->01:10:51.414
detective you go to the next
step, middle, you play, you
learn, we have people there

01:10:51.414-->01:10:56.252
teaching you and then when
you’re ready, you jump into the
deep end um as Grifter mentioned

01:10:56.252-->01:11:01.424
I think we made the deep end a
little too deep [laughs] but we
intend to make it a little bit

01:11:01.424-->01:11:06.429
deeper, so bring it. And then uh
as he mentioned it’s a little of
everything, we have a lot of

01:11:08.564-->01:11:14.070
crazy things in there, data
exfiltration, custom protocols,
custom crypto, uh yeah we rolled

01:11:14.070-->01:11:20.042
our own crypter uh crypto and um
we had some ridiculous stuff in
there there’s the steganography

01:11:20.042-->01:11:25.047
in there Um we had a great time
putting stuff all over the place
um and out of the entire

01:11:28.050-->01:11:32.855
conference that played it all
you know the hundreds of people
that competed we only had twenty

01:11:32.855-->01:11:38.427
six percent of the challenge
solved so maybe a little too
hard, maybe a lot, what do you

01:11:38.427-->01:11:44.567
think? >>Mean! >>Keep it there,
be mean? Torture? Yeah? Okay
keep being mean. Noted [laughs]

01:11:44.567-->01:11:51.340
uh so so we had we had uh
companies coming up to us
through this whole thing and

01:11:51.340-->01:11:55.912
they’re like will you share the
winners with us, we wanna hire
them? [laughs] so not giving out

01:11:55.912-->01:12:01.817
any information to anybody we’ll
let them know hey there’s people
that want you but no um but we

01:12:01.817-->01:12:07.190
had uh this absolute awesome
team they competed a couple
years ago and won prior to it

01:12:07.190-->01:12:11.127
being a black badge and you know
had the pouty face and they came
back year after year and they

01:12:11.127-->01:12:16.332
finally got it. So this like
this is like their what fourth,
fifth year? Something like that

01:12:16.332-->01:12:21.337
playing it so uh uh I wanna you
know really thank the uh team
and their uh their name is What

01:12:24.040-->01:12:29.045
is a Packet and here is their
prize, whad-o-cash [applause] um
black badge effect alright,

01:12:33.182-->01:12:38.187
thank you guys >>Put it on red!
>>Um and one aha yeah, and one
last thing, for Wall of Sheep,

01:12:44.393-->01:12:49.398
your APIs are leaking like hell!
See ya! [applause] >>And now
>>And now yes, uh so um you may

01:13:02.378-->01:13:09.085
know these guys, you may not. Um
they call themselves the Order
of the Overflow and even you

01:13:09.085-->01:13:14.090
don’t know them, you know their
contest, Capture the Flag.
[applause] I’m gonna, I’m gonna

01:13:19.662-->01:13:24.667
put that [indiscernible] >>Hello
hackers! I’m Zardus, and this is
the Order of the Overflow we

01:13:30.306-->01:13:35.311
have been here among you since
Defcon 9, we have been playing
CTF since DefCon 12 we were

01:13:39.315-->01:13:44.320
raised in this community and now
we are professors, freelance
hackers, engineers, and we are

01:13:48.424-->01:13:53.429
still here every year playing
DefCon CTF and now hosting. We
played DefCon CTF for a long

01:13:58.367-->01:14:04.407
time and when LegitBS the prior
organizer stepped down we felt
the call to step up and uh carry

01:14:04.407-->01:14:09.412
on this tradition of an awesome
game for some of the best
hackers around. We had three

01:14:13.916-->01:14:18.921
guiding philosophical principles
one we wanted to be inclusive,
we wanted to raise the

01:14:21.290-->01:14:26.295
inclusivity and the positivity
of the community, uh two, let me
look them up [laughter] uh we

01:14:31.867-->01:14:37.840
wanted to be inspirational, we
wanna inspire the next
generation in a similar way that

01:14:37.840-->01:14:43.346
the amazing hackers we saw as we
were walking around DefCon 9
completely clueless, inspired

01:14:43.346-->01:14:48.351
us. And number three, we wanted
to innovate, responsibly
innovate the game into new

01:14:50.786-->01:14:55.791
areas, new formats, new types of
challenges. And so I’ll talk a
bit about the innovations that

01:14:58.227-->01:15:03.165
we did uh this year um one was
kind of a scooped a little bit
uh by an earlier CTF we

01:15:07.336-->01:15:11.874
integrated capture uh capture
the flag, we integrate capture
the flag! [laughter] uh we

01:15:11.874-->01:15:17.780
integrated king of the hill uh
and attack defense services
together so in traditional

01:15:17.780-->01:15:23.619
attack defense teams attack each
other to steal information um
and try to defend themselves

01:15:23.619-->01:15:28.724
against the attacks of other
teams. With king of the hill
teams additionally had to create

01:15:28.724-->01:15:33.729
the most elegant or the best
solution uh additionally we uh
tried to have a much much higher

01:15:36.832-->01:15:41.837
emphasis on raw hacking skill uh
to do this for example we
delayed the resist of network

01:15:44.707-->01:15:49.879
traffic significantly to force
hackers to come up with novel
original exploits instead of

01:15:49.879-->01:15:54.884
script kitting them off the
wire. Um Right and third with
the rise of automation the cyber

01:16:00.456-->01:16:05.861
grand challenge recently and all
of this uh awesome new
technology which is really cool

01:16:05.861-->01:16:10.699
it has become much harder to
tell where the human skill ends
and where the automated skill

01:16:10.699-->01:16:17.173
begins in many contexts this is
great but in CTF we wanted to
find the best humans and

01:16:17.173-->01:16:22.178
identify even among them who the
best hackers are and so we
heavily limited the uh what is

01:16:24.747-->01:16:29.518
probably currently the most
advanced part of this automation
which is automated patching we

01:16:29.518-->01:16:35.424
heavily limited patching so that
teams could only patch a certain
amount of bytes per service so

01:16:35.424-->01:16:41.497
we had a service with multiple
vulnerabilities for example
where teams had to patch in

01:16:41.497-->01:16:46.502
under ten bytes and they did
which was incredible So.
[laughter]. With all of this of

01:16:49.271-->01:16:54.276
course we had to keep uh DefCon
CTF as an this awesome top CTF
uh and with this came some

01:16:59.014-->01:17:03.953
traditions which uh we embraced
we had multiple qualifying
events, the best CTFs in the

01:17:06.222-->01:17:11.227
world, from which the best
hackers in the world qualified
for DefCon uh hosted by awesome

01:17:14.997-->01:17:22.738
amazing conferences and awesome
amazing teams we had our own
qualifying event uh and overall

01:17:22.738-->01:17:29.211
over six hundred teams played in
our event, of which twenty four
qualified together with the

01:17:29.211-->01:17:38.621
prequals. Um and then we made
this game and uh it was an
absurd amount of work um and all

01:17:38.621-->01:17:43.792
of these uh fine hackers can
complain about it a lot more
than I can, but if you haven’t

01:17:43.792-->01:17:51.901
slept in you know six months um
we uh of course had issues, uh
with our first year running

01:17:51.901-->01:17:56.305
this, uh turns out when you
invite the best hackers in the
world, and you invite them all

01:17:56.305-->01:18:01.076
to connect to your network, and
you invite them all to attack
everything uh s**t catches on

01:18:01.076-->01:18:09.218
fire [laughter] um so we had
this awesome uh situation set of
situations where we would be

01:18:09.218-->01:18:14.156
fixing stuff as it was burning
uh and overnight the teams would
be hacking things, and we would

01:18:14.156-->01:18:18.427
be fixing things, and then in
the morning they would hack the
things we fixed, it was pretty

01:18:18.427-->01:18:27.469
incredible uh so everyone had a
great time before I get to uh
announce any oh yes and we

01:18:27.469-->01:18:34.910
captured of course all the
packet uh traffic, we captured
all game events, uh we

01:18:34.910-->01:18:42.318
accumulated an enormous amount
of data overall that we hope
will be very useful to community

01:18:42.318-->01:18:50.759
going forward to analyze how top
hackers perform um so before
moving on to announcing the

01:18:50.759-->01:18:59.501
winners, um I’d like to uh give
special thanks to a number of uh
people uh for one thing, the

01:18:59.501-->01:19:14.183
entire DefCon crew uh and the
goons Porkus, Brian, Grifter,
Dark Tangent [applause] I’d like

01:19:14.183-->01:19:22.424
to thank also Encore, they
helped us set up our AV uh stuff
which hopefully the hackers

01:19:22.424-->01:19:28.964
found extremely distracting and
you found entertaining um we’d
like to thank legitimate

01:19:28.964-->01:19:37.539
business syndicate which is the
prior DefCon CTF organizer uh
[cheers] yeah! [applause]

01:19:37.539-->01:19:45.981
[indiscernible] Guy NoVido, uh
Sir Goon, LIghtning and HJ
there, amazing set of people um

01:19:45.981-->01:19:53.355
and special thanks to our uh
poor undergrads that we brought
with us um these ASU students I

01:19:53.355-->01:20:01.130
don’t know if they’re here but
they uh we basically enslaved
them for a weekend they were uh

01:20:01.130-->01:20:05.334
running cables, running water,
running coffee, they were
running everything, except for

01:20:05.334-->01:20:12.474
digital uh services, that was us
unfortunately um and we'd like
to thank our families who

01:20:12.474-->01:20:21.316
haven’t seen us at all you know
again um and I’d like to thank
my team here uh none of this

01:20:21.316-->01:20:29.325
would be possible without them,
so we have Flipper, incredible
hacker, Adam Dupet, he’s okay

01:20:29.325-->01:20:43.105
[laughter] we have Oto, Tiffany
Bow, [indiscernible], uh Jeffrey
Crowl, Ray Yammer, Noel Pointer,

01:20:43.105-->01:20:58.921
and Alexandras Caprebellus give
it up for this amazing crew
[applause]. So we had uh an

01:20:58.921-->01:21:05.728
interesting issue this year with
the room we had to fight with uh
the fire marshall and we had to

01:21:05.728-->01:21:12.634
fight with um the that balance
of trying to get people in the
room without getting the event

01:21:12.634-->01:21:20.075
shut down for risk of everyone
dying in a fire um so Dark
Tangent is interested in a show

01:21:20.075-->01:21:26.315
of hands, how many people went
by the room this year? >>Woo!
>>Woo!, Awesome. Alright, next

01:21:26.315-->01:21:32.254
year, make sure to spend even
more time there we have a lot of
interesting stuff planned if of

01:21:32.254-->01:21:40.729
course we are invited back
absolutely um alright so I’m
gonna move on to announcing the

01:21:40.729-->01:21:49.671
winners but as I do so keep in
mind that you can be up here as
well in a couple years with

01:21:49.671-->01:21:56.011

enough perseverance you can take
their place and you can take our

01:21:56.011-->01:22:05.954
place [laughter] You’re the
future yes please take our place
[laughter] Alright so without

01:22:05.954-->01:22:18.200
further ado let’s move on to our
winners so in third place we

Good job, give em a hand

01:23:17.826-->01:23:30.005
[applause] Alright in first
place with a motto of when

01:23:30.005-->01:23:56.565
Deathcore Root [applause] [off
mic chatter] Alright so we’ll
now uh confer the black badges

01:23:56.565-->01:24:01.803
onto our winners, they’re more
than eight of you here
[laughter] uh we’ll confer the

01:24:01.803-->01:24:08.443
black badges onto eight of these
uh brilliant hackers so give em
one more round of applause

01:24:08.443-->01:24:35.437
[applause] and let’s do this.
Final round of applause for
Deathcore Root! [applause] Thank

01:24:35.437-->01:24:50.419
you all we hope to see you next
year and remember, obey the
order of the overflow. >>Really

01:24:50.419-->01:24:56.725
well done guys [applause] let me
get my phone back >>I was gonna
say, isn’t that yours, it’s ours

01:24:56.725-->01:25:06.501
now. Um so again uh thank you to
all of the organizers and all of
the contestants um not only um

01:25:06.501-->01:25:12.474
for you know designing and and
competing in all these things
but also for creating a really

01:25:12.474-->01:25:17.245
cool atmosphere around DefCon,
when you see these folks uh and
the level of focus that they

01:25:17.245-->01:25:22.417
have whether that be um you know
on hacking some of the most
complicated systems that these

01:25:22.417-->01:25:29.992
guys can craft for them or the
dedication they put into a
tinfoil hat um you know we love

01:25:29.992-->01:25:42.738
we love seeing it and uh and it
makes us love DefCon so thank
you again. [applause] >>It truly

01:25:42.738-->01:25:48.577
takes I think I put it in the
program over fifteen, sixteen,
seventeen hundred people to put

01:25:48.577-->01:25:54.750
on the contests uh the goons the
villages and uh you can see the
departments here we have almost

01:25:54.750-->01:26:01.556
four hundred and fifty goons
just to try to make the uh the
departments work um and so you

01:26:01.556-->01:26:05.227
can see all the departments that
we have and I’d just like to
give a round of applause and a

01:26:05.227-->01:26:10.298
special appreciation just to all
the goons that work year round
to get ready [applause] >>Woo!

01:26:10.298-->01:26:26.248
[from audience] [whistling] >>So
when when people talk about it
we really exist to try to

01:26:26.248-->01:26:32.054
provide that platform for
everybody else in the community
to run their event and you can

01:26:32.054-->01:26:39.094
see it takes it takes a lot of
people um and a lot of
dedication. So we have uh some

01:26:39.094-->01:26:44.633
goons on the way uh retiring and
we have some new goons coming in
and we just wanna call out um

01:26:44.633-->01:26:50.839
the black ba- uh the gold badge
when we retire y when when you
retire let me rephrase this if

01:26:50.839-->01:26:56.578
you’ve served for ten years uh
at DefCon for more than ten
years you get a gold badge and

01:26:56.578-->01:27:01.383
the gold badge sort of acts like
a black badge in that um you’ve
put in your time you’ve got the

01:27:01.383-->01:27:08.190
scars um the psychic wounds um
and so you we will bring you
back you can come for life,

01:27:08.190-->01:27:14.096
right? You’re always one of us
um you know when you’re with the
walking wounded [laughs] of the

01:27:14.096-->01:27:19.634
goons. And so um I just wanna
say uh thank you to all the
goons of the past that have uh

01:27:19.634-->01:27:24.940
done that and retired, you’re
always welcome and then I wanna
welcome the new goons who don’t

01:27:24.940-->01:27:35.550
know what they’ve gotten
themselves into [cheering]
[laughs][applause] Is uh Major

01:27:35.550-->01:27:43.692
Malfunction here? So we have a
QM stores and if you if you
think about who’s in here the

01:27:43.692-->01:27:49.030
longest um even longer than the
NOC, the NOC has to get
equipment well they have to pick

01:27:49.030-->01:27:56.872
the equipment up from somewhere
and that’s our QM stores
[applause] and so uh we have a

01:27:56.872-->01:28:02.611
little story here where, the QM
stores, we have warehouse space
all over Las Vegas in multiple

01:28:02.611-->01:28:07.149
places and we have all these
semi trucks that swoop in and
bring literally thousands and

01:28:07.149-->01:28:12.854
thousands and thousands of
pounds of and I think last count
we had like over sixty palettes

01:28:12.854-->01:28:18.460
of equipment [indiscernible
shout from audience] yeahoh
palettes! Um and so this year um

01:28:18.460-->01:28:25.100
you might have seen online we
have our poor projectors poor
poor projectors, one one three

01:28:25.100-->01:28:30.505
zero six two five seven and
sixty nine, which tells you
something that we have over a

01:28:30.505-->01:28:36.678
hundred projectors and uh
there’s a little bit of mistake
we got a call that said hey um

01:28:36.678-->01:28:43.451
four of your projectors all just
failed we need more projectors
what that’s a what a what a

01:28:43.451-->01:28:48.256
coincidence, um eighteen volts
you don’t wanna plug into the
HDMI port that is expecting five

01:28:48.256-->01:29:00.268
volts [laughs] or it lets all of
the smoke out [laughter] and so
here’s our our pelican case

01:29:00.268-->01:29:06.341
where the wrong voltage uh was
plugged into the HDMI
distribution block and they all

01:29:06.341-->01:29:14.482
died so we’re gonna poor one out
for the projectors okay
[applause] so [cheering]

01:29:14.482-->01:29:29.397
[applause] yeah! So uh [laughs]
next year we’re going home we’re
going home next year to Paris

01:29:29.397-->01:29:35.170
and Bally’s, a place we know and
love um except we’ve kind of
grown up a little bit and so

01:29:35.170-->01:29:43.778
we’ve had to expand a little bit
so we’re plugging into Planet
Hollywood [cheering] yeah so

01:29:43.778-->01:29:50.051
instead of forcing you out into
the orb for ten minutes or so
we’re hoping we can get that

01:29:50.051-->01:29:58.460
down to like maybe a minute uh
less cancer [cheering] so next
year we’re hoping to have more

01:29:58.460-->01:30:05.200
the same or more square footage
uh three hotels maybe a fourth
if we have to but we’re gonna be

01:30:05.200-->01:30:12.874
back at the Paris Bally’s plus
Planet Hollywood, more hopefully
workshops and uh [cheering] that

01:30:12.874-->01:30:18.346
is what I’ve got to say oh one
last thing that’s not on the
slides in case uh you’re keeping

01:30:18.346-->01:30:25.887
score last year I talked about
this desire to expand the DefCon
culture overseas and we were

01:30:25.887-->01:30:31.526
talking about maybe doing a
DefCon China >>Woo! >>We did
that, it happened, [cheering]

01:30:31.526-->01:30:39.701
those are the people that
actually went [laughs] so we
tried a DefCon China, it worked,

01:30:39.701-->01:30:46.207
we were planning for six hundred
and we got fourteen hundred it
was a huge success and so don’t

01:30:46.207-->01:30:51.913
be afraid we’re doing DefCon
China again next year [cheering]
uh we want to get you involved

01:30:51.913-->01:30:58.119
and so we have DefCon China
t-shirts here that are like
electroluminescent, and they

01:30:58.119-->01:31:09.097
light up [off mic comment] We
don’t know yet yeah. So anyhow.
Yeah yeah [laughs] our friends

01:31:09.097-->01:31:15.637
over here from the other
communist nation of Cuba is
jealous that the nation of China

01:31:15.637-->01:31:21.142
has uh has got us so our other
communist overlords here wanted
us to come to Cuba [laughs]

01:31:21.142-->01:31:27.349
Alright, thank you so much!

audience] I don’t want to say

01:31:27.349-->01:31:32.087
