00:00:00.133,00:00:06.173
>>Good afternoon everybody, my
name is George Tarnovsky, I work
with Cisco and I’m lab manager

00:00:06.173,00:00:11.912
at uh one of our labs in uh
Herndon, Virginia. Thank you for
coming, this is a talk about

00:00:11.912,00:00:18.218
hardware, it’s not Hex-rays it’s
X-Rays so if you’re here for
software, you might learn

00:00:18.218,00:00:22.890
something anyways so stick
around. Anyways, stay uh be
patient with me because we’re

00:00:22.89-->000:00:28.128
gonna start elementary and we’ll
work up to something pretty
interesting. Okay, so here we

00:00:28.128,00:00:34.968
go. So as most of you know uh,
circuit boards come in various
shapes and sizes and the

00:00:34.968,00:00:39.973
complexity really isn’t evident
from outside the board. Okay, so
this is the X-ray machine that

00:00:46.914,00:00:53.153
uh, that we use. It’s a
Glenbrook Technologies uh 9-->0 uh
Jewelbox 90 so it’s a 90

00:00:53.153,00:00:58.659
kilovolt machine. Um, it’s as
you can see, it’s got a window
in the front. It’s a leaded

00:00:58.659,00:01:03.096
glass so it’s pretty safe,
you’re not gonna- you’re not
gonna have too many issues at

00:01:03.096,00:01:06.900
all. Uh we check the machine
every- everyday when we use it
to make sure that there’s

00:01:06.90-->000:01:11.305
nothing happening that’s gonna
affect us because when you’re
running this x-ray when you go

00:01:11.305,00:01:16.610
to the dentist, uh your x-ray’s
on for three quarters of uh,
quarter of a second, half a

00:01:16.61-->000:01:21.615
second. Uh this machine is on
for up to fifteen minutes so the
exposure time is- is huge. So uh

00:01:24.117,00:01:30.123
for your own sake ya know it’s
best that you check it right? So
the- the slide to the right is

00:01:30.123,00:01:36.063
the- is the actual uh stage. And
uh the red dot, I don’t know if
you can see the dot on that

00:01:36.063,00:01:41.068
slide, uh that is where we’ll be
looking in this particular case
on- on- in that picture so it

00:01:43.07-->000:01:47.140
gives you an idea of where you
are, where you’re looking. So
uh, you know they say that

00:01:47.14-->000:01:53.714
x-rays are dangerous but
obviously I don’t believe that’s
the case because uh this was me

00:01:53.714,00:01:59.319
just five years ago. [Audience
laughing] So you can see
nothing’s uh changed. Now that’s

00:01:59.319,00:02:04.257
uh actually some of you probably
I’m dating myself because that’s
uh that’s pre- pre-IBM PC. So

00:02:07.527,00:02:12.532
it’s like uh ‘79, ‘80 but
anyway, okay. Enough of that, so
let’s to down to business. So,

00:02:15.035,00:02:19.973
uh so uh cross sectional views
of some PC boards. As I said,
I’m gonna start out elementary

00:02:19.973,00:02:24.344
so just bear with me and we-
we’ll work up to uh something a
little more technical. But in

00:02:24.344,00:02:29.916
any event, uh the slide to the
left is a two layer simple
design. Uh you’ve all probably

00:02:29.916,00:02:35.522
have seen that you can easily
trace through that top and
bottom layers easily uh, it’s

00:02:35.522,00:02:40.427
not a problem. And if you look
at uh the uh the slide to the-
the illustration to the right,

00:02:40.427,00:02:46.233
it’s a complex 12 layer board.
Um, not only is it 12 layers but
it’s 12 layers including plane

00:02:46.233,00:02:50.704
layers. Um, does- does everybody
understand the illustration or
should I get into that with

00:02:50.704,00:02:57.577
regards to what these- what
these coms, go into it? N- no
okay just keep moving, alright

00:02:57.577,00:03:01.681
very good. So in any event,
because you have plane layers in
there, obviously you’re not

00:03:01.681,00:03:05.519
going to be able to see anything
if you’re trying to do any
reverse engineering like for

00:03:05.519,00:03:10.524
instance with uh optics. So, uh
common methods for reverse
engineering backlighting,

00:03:12.692,00:03:18.298
conductive tracing, and
mechanical delayering. So uh
backlighting is effective again

00:03:18.298,00:03:22.903
without- without plane layers -
if you have a plane layer or
even with a multi-layer board,

00:03:22.903,00:03:27.974
it’s difficult but it can be
done. WIth a plane layer, all
bets are off. Uh, when you talk

00:03:27.974,00:03:34.247
about conductive tracing, well
that’s pretty tedious task. It
can be done, it’s difficult

00:03:34.247,00:03:39.052
though. Uh, mechanical
delayering is very destructive.
Um it can- again it can be done.

00:03:39.052,00:03:43.490
Even with populate- here I say
it’s ineffective but populated
board uh it- it can be done with

00:03:43.49-->000:03:49.896
populated boards. Uh in uh Recon
Canada, they gave an
illustration of uh mechanical

00:03:49.896,00:03:56.336
delayering uh that was effective
and of course, you’ve got
nothing left besides a pile of

00:03:56.336,00:04:02.809
powder when you’re done but- but
get- you get your uh your- your
layers separated and you have-

00:04:02.809,00:04:09.649
you have what you wanted, the
drawing. So, um in in- during uh
in- in backlighting on a simple

00:04:09.649,00:04:14.621
double- double-sided board you
can see the top illustration. It
it’d be pre- pretty easy to go

00:04:14.621,00:04:18.592
through and trace that board
right? I mean, everything is
pretty evident with the

00:04:18.592,00:04:23.864
exception of what’s underneath
the devices and that you can
find so that’s pretty simple. Uh

00:04:23.864,00:04:28.702
the bottom illustration, you’ve
got backlighting on boards that
have internal plane layers, both

00:04:28.702,00:04:32.806
of those uh I mean you can see
that uh you’re not gonna get
anything except the top and

00:04:32.806,00:04:39.479
bottom layer. Uh, you’re not
gonna find anything on the thing
internally. So, uh everyone’s

00:04:39.479,00:04:44.484
familiar with BGA, Ball Grid
Arrays? Great. So heh, so what
this- this is a, this is an FPGA

00:04:48.121,00:04:52.959
so what it actually is- is a
device sitting on a circuit
board that’s placed on a circuit

00:04:52.959,00:04:57.497
board. So as compared to
conventional means where you’ve
got uh leads and you put them

00:04:57.497,00:05:02.169
through a hole and you solder
them. In this case, you’ve got
spheres of solder, that’s the

00:05:02.169,00:05:08.508
center - that’s the single, it’s
the center slide. Uh and they uh
actually melt onto the pad and

00:05:08.508,00:05:13.513
that becomes your con- contact.
Obviously conventional solder
means are not good- are not

00:05:13.513,00:05:18.218
going to get the job done so
it’s done through hot air and
it’s- it’s, there’s some

00:05:18.218,00:05:23.223
precision. Uh you can do it in a
toaster oven however uh good
luck.Heh, you could very well

00:05:26.059,00:05:31.064
separate the board layers; it’s-
it’s a little risky. Uh, the-
the vial to the right is uh is

00:05:33.20-->000:05:38.205
uh standard- standard balls for
um, for replacing FPGA uh sphere
or ball after uh after you

00:05:41.641,00:05:46.646
remove it for instance. If you
remove the FPGA and you want to
reball it and replace it. Okay,

00:05:51.051,00:05:57.991
so uh with the x-ray uh the the-
illustration, the- the picture
to the left uh compliments of

00:05:57.991,00:06:02.929
Semiconductor Guru’s uh is a
decapsulated device.The picture
on the right is the same device

00:06:05.065,00:06:11.504
panelized and x-rayed. So what
you’re seeing is to the left you
see details of the actual

00:06:11.504,00:06:17.577
device, uh memory layout,
everything is there. Uh, with-
with x-ray all you’re seeing is

00:06:17.577,00:06:21.781
the parameter of the dye. So
x-ray sees right through the
silicon so that’s gonna be

00:06:21.781,00:06:25.185
useless for anything like that
cause that question has come up
before where people think you

00:06:25.185,00:06:30.190
can use an x-ray to reverse
engineer a device; you can’t uh
for that reason. Okay, so uh

00:06:33.093,00:06:38.098
there’s practically nothing you
can hide from an x-ray. And I’ll
show you some- some uh some-

00:06:40.70-->000:06:46.506
some devices we’ve had to
reverse engineer that were- they
tried to hide their design from

00:06:46.506,00:06:51.511
us. It didn’t work out too well.
So here’s a uh illustration of
a- of a BGA and it looks pretty

00:06:55.548,00:07:00.787
complicated because you’re
looking or convoluted. You’ve
got the standard spheres, you’ve

00:07:00.787,00:07:05.759
got internal bond wires, that’s
uh that’s that matrix you can
see coming off them but then

00:07:05.759,00:07:10.263
you- you’ve got like you’ve got
Via’s on top of Via’s and then
you’ve got Via’s of different

00:07:10.263,00:07:14.467
sizes and that- that can be
rather confusing but the reason
that you’re seeing this is

00:07:14.467,00:07:19.372
you’re as I showed you in one of
the first picture of the BGA.
You’ve got a circuit board on

00:07:19.372,00:07:24.878
top of a circuit board so the
small feature sizes, uh on the
BGA. Uh, I don't know, do I

00:07:24.878,00:07:29.883
have a pointer, no I don’t.
Okay, nevermind heh. So uh the-
the small Via’s are on the

00:07:36.289,00:07:41.194
circuit board that the BGA is
on; the large ones are on the
circuit board the BGA’s mounted

00:07:41.194,00:07:47.467
on so that’s why it looks a bit
odd when you see a- a Via on top
of a Via or slightly offset. Uh,

00:07:47.467,00:07:52.172
you can- you can, can everyone
see the bond wires? Yeah, I
think it’s pretty clear. Okay,

00:07:52.172,00:07:57.177
so the larger Via by the way is
about 8,000th of an inch. So you
can see that the bond wires are

00:07:59.446,00:08:04.384
uh well fractional. In any
event, that’s internal to the
BGA. Okay, so this, I’m gonna

00:08:09.322,00:08:14.327
skip this slide. Uh oh, what
happened? Maybe I won’t skip
this slide, I can’t move. Haha.

00:08:25.271,00:08:29.709
Uh, did it go? It went, okay, it
went. Alright nevermind
nevermind nevermind. Okays, so-

00:08:29.709,00:08:37.550
so I’ll just show this to you
this way. Uh the- the- the- the
-the um, the x-ray machine

00:08:37.55-->000:08:44.391
allows me to do angular views so
to give you an idea, the- the
direct view on the left side,

00:08:44.391,00:08:49.028
you can see the traces are- are
one on top of the others so you
really can’t differentiate

00:08:49.028,00:08:56.036
between what where-, what where-
does the trace fall within the
structure of the- of the circuit

00:08:56.036,00:09:00.807
board. What layer is it on? So
the - you can angle it and at
that point if you look at the

00:09:00.807,00:09:06.946
view on the right, you can see
where now they’ve separated out
and you can clearly see, well

00:09:06.946,00:09:12.485
maybe you can’t clearly see. If
you look at the Via’s the three
Via’s that are along the bottom,

00:09:12.485,00:09:17.323
you’ll see that the lines that
are coming off actually step to
different positions and you can-

00:09:17.323,00:09:20.527
you can figure what layer it’s
on and then you can go through
and you can trace it the rest of

00:09:20.527,00:09:30.103
the way. So the one feature that
this has that’s pretty unique is
a geometric zoom so remember I

00:09:30.103,00:09:39.112
told you this is a live view.
But I don’t think I can, I can’t
do- oh yeah here we go, okay,

00:09:39.112,00:09:43.983
cool. So the signal to noise is
sacrificed when you’re doing
that because you want the

00:09:43.983,00:09:49.055
sampling rate to be high so
that’s why it looks a little
grainy. But once you get to your

00:09:49.055,00:09:56.696
uh once you get to where you
want to be, then you can go back
to 256 samples uh averages and

00:09:56.696,00:10:04.804
then it clears up so here we go.
Okay, there you go. So let’s uh,
so that’s it. So you can see the

00:10:04.804,00:10:08.241
benefit of this machine because
you can do it live. You can
actually- and I’ll show that to

00:10:08.241,00:10:13.413
you with a live trace. Skip that
one, here we go. So this is a
trace where we actually have to

00:10:13.413,00:10:24.390
trace, where’d it go? Oh okay,
here we go. Okay so we’re gonna
trace that second line of- of

00:10:24.39-->000:10:28.194
well anyway, okay. You’ll see-
see what I mean. So this is
again, the signal to noise isn’t

00:10:28.194,00:10:32.232
as good because- because we
want- we want to see what’s
going on otherwise it’s it would

00:10:32.232,00:10:38.605
take minutes. Um but- but we get
some place we want- we want to
get clarity like for instance

00:10:38.605,00:10:43.176
that vertical line, that’s what
we’re tracing. So it looks uh a
little convoluted so see now I

00:10:43.176,00:10:49.482
did the uh 256 samples so it’s
clear now where it’s going and
now we can continue to trace.

00:10:49.482,00:10:58.892
And this would be typical if you
were looking at something and
wanted to trace the line. So

00:10:58.892,00:11:06.533
now, we’re getting into a BGA
and again I can’t differentiate
whe- whether it’s the top or the

00:11:06.533,00:11:12.105
bottom so we increase the
sampling rate, we stop for a
minute, we zoom in, I forget if

00:11:12.105,00:11:22.515
I did that or not but anyway uh
just to clarify, for our own
sake, where-where we are. Okay,

00:11:22.515,00:11:30.123
so now we’re gonna zoom in a
little bit, we don’t want to
lose our place. And you’re

00:11:30.123,00:11:34.060
seeing this in real time, I’m
not speeding this up any- or
slowing it down for that matter

00:11:34.06-->000:11:40.934
but it’s ideally what you’d be
doing if you were actually- if
it was necessary for you to do

00:11:40.934,00:11:55.381
this, uh to reverse engineer
something. Okay now we’re
getting into the BGA. I don’t

00:11:55.381,00:12:01.220
know if anybody followed this
but it’s- it’s centered pretty
much center Via and the in goes

00:12:01.22-->000:12:07.560
up and there we are. So that is
uh that’d be typical trace if
you went through it. So here’s

00:12:07.56-->000:12:12.432
another- another one where we
had a BGA and we had to figure
out where it was going and what,

00:12:12.432,00:12:21.641
we- we didn’t know where uh the-
the I.O. lines were going so- so
we used the x-ray to- to get

00:12:21.641,00:12:28.748
there. I’m sorry I’m not seeing
the right things here. Okay, so
here’s another one where they-

00:12:28.748,00:12:33.620
they had the plane layer on the
outside so consequently you’re
not gonna see anything on the

00:12:33.62-->000:12:40.393
inside and you can see it’s
pretty compl- complicated.
Here’s a, here’s some methods

00:12:40.393,00:12:45.498
for obscuring the view. Uh the
top is uh epoxy so the- the
board was coated with epoxy. The

00:12:45.498,00:12:52.972
epoxy is the same resin as the
board so consequently if you try
to dissolve it, you dissolve the

00:12:52.972,00:12:59.178
board. So using x-ray we were
able to reverse engineer that
and that was pretty easy. Uh the

00:12:59.178,00:13:02.915
one on the bottom that was a
little different because we
weren’t sure what was going on.

00:13:02.915,00:13:08.655
Turn out they took a smart card,
they chopped out the smart card
itself. Uh to the right you can

00:13:08.655,00:13:12.458
see that’s there a footprint of
a smart card there and they
glued it in there and they

00:13:12.458,00:13:18.965
covered it up so nobody knew
what they did. Ah hah. Okay so
uh, here’s uh ok so here’s the

00:13:18.965,00:13:26.806
one of the other methods was to
epoxy a sheet of lead inside to
cover in- on top of the board

00:13:26.806,00:13:31.644
and then cover it with epoxy to
try to hide the design from
x-ray. That didn’t work either

00:13:31.644,00:13:35.748
cause there’s all you have to do
is increase the power you’ll
see. Yeah there’s some- some

00:13:35.748,00:13:44.057
variation but you’ll see it.
Also we were able to pull the
lead out but anyway uh okay. Rad

00:13:44.057,00:13:47.694
hardened devices, so the Rad
hardened devices, it‘s
interesting you can see through

00:13:47.694,00:13:51.631
it however if you look at the
slide to the right you can see
the variation between Rad

00:13:51.631,00:13:57.270
hardened device that’s that-
that dark area, you can see some
of the pads but that’s compared

00:13:57.27-->000:14:04.243
to a normal BGA where we
would’ve seen everything. And of
course failure analysis is a big

00:14:04.243,00:14:10.483
reason to have a BG- have a
x-ray. So the slide to the, the
slide to the top left, there’s a

00:14:10.483,00:14:16.322
missing, there’s a missing
sphere. I’m- I don’t know if
everyone can see that. Like the

00:14:16.322,00:14:22.962
fourth one in from the left and
fourth one up. So that’s one
reason the other- the other the

00:14:22.962,00:14:27.033
center slide shows you shorts
that you would that would not be
evident to the to anybody

00:14:27.033,00:14:32.939
because that’s on the inside.
You can, you can see the spheres
on the outside of the BGA if you

00:14:32.939,00:14:36.843
tilt it and you can see them but
you’d never the inside where
they are. Uh to the right,

00:14:36.843,00:14:44.817
that’s a that’s a real mess.
That was uh yeah that’s a, and
that happens when you- when you

00:14:44.817,00:14:49.956
allow moisture. The spheres are
hydroscopic so they’re gonna
absorb moisture and if you don’t

00:14:49.956,00:14:59.232
outgas them and you place them,
this is what happens. Okay so,
so this is a- a little problem

00:14:59.232,00:15:06.706
we had. Uh this was a design
using a Xilinx uh FPGA. So
there’s the bottom view of the-

00:15:06.706,00:15:13.780
of the circuit board on the
right and uh we were trying to,
we were trying to talk to it

00:15:13.78-->000:15:20.219
through JTAG so there was no- no
identification so we had
nothing. So consequently uh, I

00:15:20.219,00:15:25.458
took a look at the board and I
found that TDI was not
connected, there’s no connection

00:15:25.458,00:15:31.631
to TDI. But I knew where- which
sphere was TDI so rather than
removing the device and going

00:15:31.631,00:15:39.205
through that um, I took a pin
vice, uh drilled a hole, uh
touched the sphere. And the

00:15:39.205,00:15:43.576
reason I used a pin vice rather
than a drill is because I wanted
to be able to feel when I broke

00:15:43.576,00:15:49.982
through and I was just to the-
to the ball. Cause if I- if I
didn't do that, I probably drill

00:15:49.982,00:16:01.794
right through the device right?
So, took a pin, stuck it in
there and uh wallah, the device

00:16:01.794,00:16:07.166
was identified and uh everything
was working so we were able to
program it. Oh thank you thank

00:16:07.166,00:16:16.075
you. Well, that concludes my- my
talk. Do we have time for
questions? Question? >>Um, so

00:16:16.075,00:16:21.447
you said >>Joe! [laughing] >>
Um, you said you could only run
the x-ray for 15 minute at a

00:16:21.447,00:16:25.718
time. Is that, do you have to
cool the machine off of
something after that or >>Well,

00:16:25.718,00:16:30.756
yeah yeah they- they pretty
much, it has an internal timer
so it shuts off. That’s Joe Gram

00:16:30.756,00:16:36.896
by the way if anybody didn’t
recognize him. So, oops sorry.
>> What’s the interval you have

00:16:36.896,00:16:42.602
to wait for it to do it again?
>>Uh, seconds. Yeah, you can
just restart it again. You know

00:16:42.602,00:16:47.306
there of concern that someone’s
gonna walk away with it on and
ya know, forget about it and

00:16:47.306,00:16:51.577
that’s happened you know. It
even happened to us. You get
involved with something else and

00:16:51.577,00:16:58.451
it’s still on so timeout. But
yeah, that’s the reason. Yes. >>
You mentioned some were- were

00:16:58.451,00:17:03.623
Rad hardened. >>Yes. >>What do
they do to devices to do that?
>>They have some, they have some

00:17:03.623,00:17:09.195
lead in them, actually have some
shielding in there and again
we’re you’re able to see the

00:17:09.195,00:17:12.698
difference. You can see in that-
in that one slide you can see
the difference between the two

00:17:12.698,00:17:19.872
of them, yeah. Yes. >>What is it
that Cisco is reverse
engineering? >>Yes, thank you

00:17:19.872,00:17:30.049
very much.[Audience laughing]
Devices. Haha. But thank you for
asking. Any other questions?

00:17:30.049,00:17:34.854
Yes. >>Does the machine come
with the platform? >>I’m sorry?
>>Does the machine come with the

00:17:34.854,00:17:42.395
platform? >>Yes, yes oh yeah, it
came just the way you saw it,
yeah. Oh okay, I got the “X”.

00:17:42.395,00:17:53.639
Two more, two more questions.
Three? >>Are you reverse
engineering to counter a supply

00:17:53.639,00:17:58.778
chain threat? [Audience
laughing] >>What do you think?
[Laughing] There’s- there’s, we

00:17:58.778,00:18:06.052
do quite a bit of uh work,
different things. [Audience and
speaker laughing] Okay, okay one

00:18:06.052,00:18:11.490
more question and >>[Inaudible]
when you have multi like a lot
of layers, the way to go

00:18:11.49-->000:18:18.497
multiple layers, how [Inaudible]
>>Oh, it- it you- you can by
tilting it. When you tilt it,

00:18:18.497,00:18:23.402
it- you can actually see roughly
where it is, you can gauge where
it is, how many layers it went

00:18:23.402,00:18:27.506
down and then you can trace it
out. Alright if- if anybody else
has any questions, please come

00:18:27.506,00:18:32.845
and see me cause I’m getting
thrown off the stage so thank
you very much for coming

00:18:32.845,00:00:00.000
everybody. Thank you, thank you.
[applause]
