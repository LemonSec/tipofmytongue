00:00:00.067-->00:00:05.072
>>Welcome everyone to the DefCon
Diversity panel. Nobody alright
[laughter] Welcome everybody to

00:00:09.843-->00:00:14.848
DefCon 101, THE panel. I’m not
going to talk about the level of
hate that was just exposed right

00:00:19.253-->00:00:24.258
there. Um so, how many people
have never been to DefCon
before. Raise your hand. Wow all

00:00:32.566-->00:00:38.772
the noobs [applause] Welcome. It
is actually super exciting to
see that many people. You know,

00:00:38.772-->00:00:43.777
every year DefCon grows. I’ve
been coming since 2002, coming
to DefCon but since 2002 since

00:00:48.415-->00:00:53.420
we’re not doing phrasing today.
Um and ah, every year it gets
better. About a uh a decade ago,

00:00:58.292-->00:01:03.230
HighWiz started DefCon 101 as a
way to kinda introduce people to
DefCon, and teach them, you know

00:01:07.634-->00:01:12.639
uh what to expect so first,
welcome to def- Las Vegas.
Please pace yourselves. That

00:01:18.011-->00:01:24.551
squirrel is for you Jericho
[speaker laughs] Oh there’s more
I don’t know how many middle

00:01:24.551-->00:01:30.557
fingers you have. Um seriously
for those of you who’ve never
been to de- uh Las Vegas before,

00:01:30.557-->00:01:36.964
uh it can be a little bit
overwhelming. It it’s veryto.wh
shiny, very distracting. Um so

00:01:36.964-->00:01:43.937
definitely pace yourselves,
DefCon is a few days so you
don’t want to shoot your wad on

00:01:43.937-->00:01:48.942
the first day. Alright, not
advancing There we go, look and
the I this is what what I needed

00:01:58.919-->00:02:03.857
anyway, I needed Clippy um so
we’re going to talk about being
a noob. Everybody’s a noob at

00:02:07.094-->00:02:12.099
something. We are all noobs. We
all consider ourselves noobs and
embrace that. Um noob has had a

00:02:14.334-->00:02:20.007
uh a bad connotation for a long
time, but this is one of those
instances where a if you’re a

00:02:20.007-->00:02:25.012
noob that’s okay, because you
shouldn’t DGAF Don’t Give A
F*ck. If you’re a noob, that

00:02:28.015-->00:02:31.985
just means you have an
opportunity to learn and you
should take that opportunity to

00:02:31.985-->00:02:36.990
learn. So we’re going to talk
about the countdown for
surviving DefCon. Anybody here

00:02:39.526-->00:02:44.531
familiar with this countdown?
One or two people? Yep, three
two one so seriously, take it

00:02:48.335-->00:02:53.340
seriously three, get at least
three hours of sleep a night. My
first DefCon I spent um 16 hours

00:02:56.343-->00:03:02.382
a day in a ca- uh CTF The second
year I was here they decided
that the CTF was going to run 24

00:03:02.382-->00:03:09.022
hours a day. Um and I will tell
you from experience, that its
its not fun when you try to fly

00:03:09.022-->00:03:14.027
back to the east coast and try
to adjust your time. Eat at
least two meals a day for those

00:03:16.496-->00:03:21.435
of you who have may have low
blood sugar problems or high
blood sugar problems, make sure

00:03:21.435-->00:03:26.440
that you eat healthy meals, a
day. They offer healthy meals in
the chill out room. And, for

00:03:28.709-->00:03:33.713
god’s sake, please bathe at
least once a day. It is the
desert and you are gonna be hot

00:03:35.749-->00:03:39.186
and if you go outside you are
going to sweat and you are going
to sweat in the hallways. I

00:03:39.186-->00:03:45.292
sweatin’ just gettin’ here so
it’s kind of kind of challenging
so please wash your hands, too.

00:03:45.292-->00:03:52.265
I was just in the bathroom, walk
out of the bathroom after
washing my hands. I watch two

00:03:52.265-->00:03:56.636
people walk right out of the
bathroom, just go to the
bathroom, walk right out.

00:03:56.636-->00:04:01.575
Please, I you know I’m not
interested in anybody that may
have, stinky pee hands. So

00:04:05.312-->00:04:10.317
again, this is a desert, stay
hydrated. [laughter] Thank you
for this slide. Um, if your pee

00:04:16.590-->00:04:21.595
is the last colour on the right.
[laughter] You are in trouble.
There is an emergency care. not

00:04:26.066-->00:04:31.872
too far urgent care, not too far
from here. So getting back to
washing your hands, um, how many

00:04:31.872-->00:04:38.745
people have been to DefCon
before? It how many have been to
DefCon before and then have been

00:04:38.745-->00:04:43.750
and had a horrible disease
afterwards? >>Or during >>Or
during. Romer, last year um, you

00:04:49.556-->00:04:54.561
know, fist your friends, fist
them often. [laughter] Ya’ll. A,
um, it is actually funny. I have

00:05:00.500-->00:05:05.505
this square up there about how
um fisting is 90 percent less
likely to relay germs, which is

00:05:08.775-->00:05:13.113
kind of funny you know cause I
also see people when they fist
the door to open the bathroom

00:05:13.113-->00:05:18.118
door anyway. But please, make
sure that you uh practice good
hygiene. So, this is Dick.

00:05:20.654-->00:05:25.659
[laughter] Dick’s a hacker. Can
you tell Dick’s a hacker? He’s
got a bad attitude, might be

00:05:29.829-->00:05:36.770
Jericho under that ski mask.
[laughter] Um, Basically I’m
going to give you guys some

00:05:36.770-->00:05:42.943
rules. Some some things I think
are basic guidelines that you
should focus on and try to um

00:05:42.943-->00:05:47.948
make your DefCon experience a
little bit better. So the-the
first one here are the basics.

00:05:50.383-->00:05:55.989
Hold the door open. Don’t let
the door close on somebody as
they, it is just plain rude. Um

00:05:55.989-->00:06:01.828
and keep your head up. I know
that a lot of you um would be
shocked to know that there are a

00:06:01.828-->00:06:05.465
lot of people walking around on
their phones, not paying
attention. In fact, they

00:06:05.465-->00:06:10.537
probably walk right into you. So
pay attention as well. Keep your
head up, pay attention and don’t

00:06:10.537-->00:06:15.675
block the hallway. The hallway
is not the place to hold a
family reunion. If you run into

00:06:15.675-->00:06:20.614
somebody that you haven’t seen
in a long time, and you wanna
have a conversation with them,

00:06:20.614-->00:06:25.418
take it off to the side. These
hallways are tiny so please make
try and make it a little bit

00:06:25.418-->00:06:30.423
easier for people. Do not, I
repeat, do not be an a**hat.
Don’t ruin people’s time. You’re

00:06:34.561-->00:06:39.566
here at DefCon to learn, you’re
here at DefCon to have a good
time. And DefCon is both of

00:06:39.566-->00:06:44.804
those things, it is fun and
educational. But there are gonna
be those people on occasion that

00:06:44.804-->00:06:51.378
are gonna do um ruin it for
everybody. It if you see
somebody harassing somebody,

00:06:51.378-->00:06:57.050
speak up. Or if you’re not
comfortable speaking up, grab
one of our red shirt goons if

00:06:57.050-->00:07:03.523
you see somebody that is um just
straight up being drunk and
belligerent, same thing. Um,

00:07:03.523-->00:07:08.495
these are not circumstances
where you need to deal with it.
You don’t want it to ruin other

00:07:08.495-->00:07:13.500
people’s time and nobody should
just turn a blind eye to it.
Please don’t heckle. You can

00:07:17.137-->00:07:21.107
heckle at this one, this is
interactive. You can just, if
you want to say, rude stuff. You

00:07:21.107-->00:07:26.880
can these guys will shortly um
but please don’t heckle the the
other speakers >> Excuse me,

00:07:26.880-->00:07:32.686
excuse me, it’s a DefCon
tradition to heckle. >>It really
is >>See? Statler and Waldorf

00:07:32.686-->00:07:37.691
[laughter] Thank you. Please
don’t heckle. [laughter] If you
disagree with something, speak

00:07:42.095-->00:07:48.935
with the speaker after it, um,
eh-eh-it you might be surprised
that you don’t know something.

00:07:48.935-->00:07:54.941
A-a but that speaker may have
information that you may learn
something. If you want to speak

00:07:54.941-->00:08:01.381
with the speaker afterward but
just don’t please don’t just
scream in the middle of a any-

00:08:01.381-->00:08:06.386
uh anybody’s talk. Not all hugs
are accepted so see >>I will I
just wanna point out that that’s

00:08:12.292-->00:08:18.965
not a hundred percent great
advise um Jericho >>We can’t
hear you! >>Well I’m f*cking

00:08:18.965-->00:08:24.671
trying, calm the f*ck down.
[laughter] Jesus Christ.
>>Heckling already >>I know for

00:08:24.671-->00:08:30.910
f**k sakes just have the rule on
the screen. Um but I will say
like Jericho heckled us so much

00:08:30.910-->00:08:34.013
at a panel one time, that we
said, “f*ck it” and just brought
him up and put him on the panel

00:08:34.013-->00:08:38.051
and so it’s not if you may if
you wanna be a speaker maybe
heckling is the way to go.

00:08:38.051-->00:08:42.589
>>That it might be [laughs] you
give it a shot and see how uh
how well that works out for you

00:08:42.589-->00:08:47.994
>>Mu-My seat’s available for
twenty dollars [laughter] >>Also
>>What else will you do for

00:08:47.994-->00:08:51.731
twenty dollars? >>Like I think
this is the first year this a
like monitors in the middle of

00:08:51.731-->00:08:56.269
the room. I looked up and like
we see the back of it back here.
I’m like why the f**k is this in

00:08:56.269-->00:09:01.007
Spanish? [Laughter] >>I’m just
making sure that you guys are
done? >>We can keep going

00:09:01.007-->00:09:06.012
>>Okay, >>Sorry ta >>Alright
carrying on >>You may continue
>>Anyway so um please it you

00:09:14.788-->00:09:19.793
know respect other people’s
space. If you know somebody and
you you hug them on a regular

00:09:22.195-->00:09:27.400
basis, obviously hug them. If
you see somebody and this is the
first time you’ve met them, you

00:09:27.400-->00:09:32.405
might want to reconsider.
Alright Phones and wireless
Everybody’s got a phone so,

00:09:36.075-->00:09:43.049
seriously, this is a hacker
convention. Chances are you need
to use your head. Disable your

00:09:43.049-->00:09:48.054
wireless if you need to play
please don’t connect to his
wireless um any-anybody that the

00:09:52.425-->00:09:57.197
it-it you hear the horror
stories, “Oh you gotta get a
burner phone”, burner phones

00:09:57.197-->00:10:01.100
still have wireless if they’re
hooked up to all your apps and
everything, it’s still it’s

00:10:01.100-->00:10:06.105
still gonna mess you up, so use
your head. Along with that,
pictures! Everybody’s phone has

00:10:08.675-->00:10:13.680
a camera so you will be in a
picture. Um again, jus take-take
that into account. I can’t tell

00:10:16.649-->00:10:19.686
you the number of times that
I’ve just walked down the hall
and watched people with their

00:10:19.686-->00:10:25.058
cameras above their heads eh uh
their phones up above their
heads filming everything. So if

00:10:25.058-->00:10:29.496
you don’t want to be in a
picture, that’s cool. You can
put a hand over your face. You

00:10:29.496-->00:10:34.501
can buy one of those crazy IR uh
visors um Pyro had them last
year. Um or you could just

00:10:37.570-->00:10:44.143
simply say, um please delete
that file. >>Or hack their phone
and delete it [laughter] Fair

00:10:44.143-->00:10:49.148
game. >>Another squirrel. Not
everything is free. It was kind
of funny this morning because I

00:10:53.553-->00:10:59.893
was watching and some people
were walking around uh and just
sorting through boxes and there,

00:10:59.893-->00:11:05.131
that’s not your stuff um so if
you see something, that doesn’t
mean that it’s free. That

00:11:05.131-->00:11:10.136
doesn’t mean that you can pick
it up. So please um make sure
that just be a good citizen. Uh

00:11:13.139-->00:11:18.678
that one I can’t really say too
much about this. >>So who wants
some free stuff? >>You wanna you

00:11:18.678-->00:11:24.083
wanna do that now? [crowd
cheers] Whoa, whoa! [Crowd
noise] >>There’s a f**kin’

00:11:24.083-->00:11:30.290
projector >>Ah, these will put
an eye out so cover your eyes
when he throws >>Throw it out!

00:11:30.290-->00:11:35.295
>>No way. >>Alright instead we
have lanyards [crowd cheers]
[speakers laugh] >>Oh s**t

00:11:44.637-->00:11:49.642
[laughter continues] >>Hey Mike,
>>Mike >>Mike, Keegan wants to
try some [laughter] >>You’re

00:11:55.181-->00:12:00.687
going to kill somebody [speaker
laughs and exhales loudly] >>All
of you guys in the front rows,

00:12:00.687-->00:12:05.692
>>Throw them back >>Do you know
who Gallagher is? There there
there will be more stuff thrown

00:12:07.794-->00:12:12.799
>>Hey >>Is there more challenge
questions? >>Hey hey come here
[Noise and laughter] >>Pay

00:12:24.243-->00:12:29.248
attention, mother f*cker
[Laughter] >>Responsibly >>Drink
responsibly son [Coughing] >>I

00:12:35.989-->00:12:40.994
have these guys to mess things
up >>Just when things are a
getting boring >>Okay, let’s go

00:12:43.162-->00:12:48.167
back to a have a plan. Anybody
was that was in here before our
talk heard about hacker tracker

00:12:51.204-->00:12:56.209
and hacker tracker is an awesome
um app. It’s gonna help you out.
Also, um try to plan use your uh

00:12:58.378-->00:13:03.082
programs, and try to identify
where you want to be because
you’re not gonna be able to be

00:13:03.082-->00:13:07.020
everywhere. So the Source of
Knowledge, are they still called
the Source of Knowledge Nikita?

00:13:07.020-->00:13:12.592
>>I think they changed their
name to the Sound of Knowledge
>>RIght so they’re The Sound of

00:13:12.592-->00:13:18.431
Knowledge, TSOK, it doesn’t
matter. Um they’re gonna be uh
somewhere where you’ll be able

00:13:18.431-->00:13:23.436
to buy a buy the videos um so
don’t freak out if you can’t
make it to the next talk. A-

00:13:26.205-->00:13:33.046
it’s gonna be okay. You guys
will all be okay. And there we
go, I already blew it, talked

00:13:33.046-->00:13:38.718
about about Hacker Tracker.
>>Nice job, Mike >>Premature
>>Yep sorry >>Premature >>Sorry.

00:13:38.718-->00:13:43.723
Alright, so the talks, there are
a lot of really good talks. I am
on the call for the uh papers

00:13:45.825-->00:13:49.729
review board. I don’t know who
else wants to admit it, but if
you see one of these orange

00:13:49.729-->00:13:54.734
badges, that’s what that means,
um we spent eight hundred hours
>>Wait wait Isn’t this the CFP

00:13:57.136-->00:14:00.873
review? >>It ips- it is >>Every
member of the panel is on the
board >>Yah >>Remember the panel

00:14:00.873-->00:14:05.712
is on the board >>Well, I didn’t
know if everybody wanted to
admit it >>I’m not [speaker

00:14:05.712-->00:14:11.684
laughs] >>Not anymore. So we
spent a lot of time it’s uh it’s
essentially a half, a part time

00:14:11.684-->00:14:17.323
job, and then it becomes a full
time job right before um the
a-a, end of the talks being

00:14:17.323-->00:14:22.028
accepted. uh we spend a lot of
time trying to figure out which
talks are gonna be good, which

00:14:22.028-->00:14:27.033
talks are not uh we get talks
upwards of well beyond 550 talks
that are submitted. >> 543 >>is

00:14:29.902-->00:14:34.907
it, what is it? >>543 >>543 >>It
was 5- >>551 >>Doesn’t matter
>>He won the bet so he’s

00:14:39.345-->00:14:44.984
sticking with the number even
though the number changed.
>>There were talks. >>I thought,

00:14:44.984-->00:14:49.122
I oh really, there were, okay.
>>No No I I won the bet.
>>Because the talks were full

00:14:49.122-->00:14:54.460
>>No, no, no, I I no, no, no
honestly, honestly because at
Base Camp I created the post and

00:14:54.460-->00:14:58.064
then I changed your number. And
I, that’s how I won the bet
>>Ahh okay [laughter] Anyway, so

00:14:58.064-->00:15:03.002
um we take a lot of pride in the
talks hopefully you guys are
going to have a good time. Um,

00:15:07.774-->00:15:13.079
villages. There are as you can
see quite a few villages and
villages have grown. >>Back up a

00:15:13.079-->00:15:19.619
step, if you attend a talk and
you really like it or really
dislike it, please give feedback

00:15:19.619-->00:15:24.624
>>Yes. you, you want me to give
you a email address? >>Yeah,
HighWiz at [laughter] >>HighWiz

00:15:27.093-->00:15:31.564
at gmail dot com. There ya go.
>>Thanks buddy [Laughter]
>>Talks at DefCon dot org Just

00:15:31.564-->00:15:36.903
email talks at DefCon dot org
>>Okay. Lots of villages,
villages are awesome because you

00:15:36.903-->00:15:42.308
get, it goes beyond talk.
Villages actually give you an
opportunity to get hands on

00:15:42.308-->00:15:49.215
experience with a lot of the um
uh the different aspects and
I’ve highlighted a few here. Um

00:15:49.215-->00:15:54.220
the ICS village, um they’ve
grown and this is a area of um
interest. If you’re trying to

00:15:58.224-->00:16:04.764
figure out where you want to go
in uh computer security and
hacking, uh there is a dearth

00:16:04.764-->00:16:10.636
of-of people that can that can
do-do ICS hacking so you might
want to consider that. We have

00:16:10.636-->00:16:14.874
The Blue Team village is brand
new this year uh if you’re
thinking that your defense

00:16:14.874-->00:16:20.513
minded, the blue team village
would be for you. Lockpick
village is always cool because

00:16:20.513-->00:16:25.518
that’s an opportunity for people
to learn how to pick locks and
who doesn’t need to pick a lock

00:16:25.518-->00:16:31.424
every once in a while. Sorry,
it's that I was hearing
whispering next to me and then

00:16:31.424-->00:16:36.429
there is soldering skills
village which probably will come
in handy with these badges. In

00:16:39.866-->00:16:45.137
addition, there are workshops,
these workshops are truly hands
on, um, often times the

00:16:45.137-->00:16:51.210
workshops are filled up min uh
well in advance, but this is
something to look uh for in the

00:16:51.210-->00:16:56.215
future. The workshops are just
like the call for papers, we go
through how many did- of those

00:16:58.284-->00:17:04.190
did we have? Hundred and
something submitted >>about that
>>Hundred and something. Anyway,

00:17:04.190-->00:17:10.830
um it’s one of those
opportunities for people to take
uh uh sit down and actually

00:17:10.830-->00:17:15.835
learn cryptography. They can
learn uh blockchain, um many
other buzzwords, um and then you

00:17:18.271-->00:17:24.944
get an opportunity to actually
do the work. Every single
instructor um actually does work

00:17:24.944-->00:17:29.949
and they are all instructor led
labs, they are not lectures. On
the other side of that, there

00:17:32.718-->00:17:37.957
are demo labs. Demo labs, we’ve
got contests, we’ve got events,
there is a lotta stuff that

00:17:37.957-->00:17:43.596
happens um at DefCon. That is
why we are as big as we are.
That is why we are across Las

00:17:43.596-->00:17:49.802
Vegas Blvd because DefCon is as
big as it is. Um, quite
honestly, there truly is too

00:17:49.802-->00:17:55.841
much for us to list. uh with
regards to contests and and
events, uh for the demo labs,

00:17:55.841-->00:18:01.280
it's an opportunity to actually
see some of these tools that
people are releasing, um so

00:18:01.280-->00:18:06.285
HighWiz did you have something
you would like to an additional
event? >>Oh the the queer con

00:18:08.921-->00:18:15.828
stuff? >>Yeah >>Yeah uh if you
uh, anybody gay here? >>Woo woo!
[from audience] >>I’m I’m being

00:18:15.828-->00:18:21.534
serious. Uh I have three uh
queer con passes if you wanna-
if someone wants to come up and

00:18:21.534-->00:18:26.639

come on up >>First three to make
it >>Yeah, first three! >>Start

00:18:26.639-->00:18:31.644

>>Look, she even came with a
rainbow on her shirt. >>That’s

00:18:34.680-->00:18:39.819
awesome. >>Oh that’s awesome!
>>oh yeah >>Woooo with a rainbow
on their shirt. >>Oh look at

00:18:39.819-->00:18:44.824
this, wow, alright >>I’m just
throwing this one [speaker
laughs] >>I’m gay, I can’t throw

00:18:47.927-->00:18:52.932
[laughter] >>I’m glad you made
the joke yes >>There you go. I’m
quite surprised >>Yeah >>Alright

00:19:01.173-->00:19:06.312
here’s an area that the um,
everybody likes to take
advantage of, swag and vendors.

00:19:06.312-->00:19:11.817
Vendors opens tomorrow. Swag was
open today. This is uh where you
get all your DefCon stuff.

00:19:11.817-->00:19:16.822
Whether you get DefCon um
branded stuff or the vendor’s is
a an actual vendor hall uh it

00:19:19.191-->00:19:24.196
was actually started DefCon
four? Right Romer? >>Sure
>>Okay. And then Romer took it

00:19:30.236-->00:19:36.275
over shortly after and it became
this awesome thing but um
vendors, the vendor hall, every

00:19:36.275-->00:19:41.647
vendor that’s in there offers
something to the c- hacker
community. um it may be

00:19:41.647-->00:19:46.786
commercial um but it they offer
something to the hacker
community. >>Trolling, trolling,

00:19:46.786-->00:19:50.990
trolling >>I’m trolling [speaker
laughs] >>He’s hoping he can the
the mic is too far away, he

00:19:50.990-->00:19:57.163
doesn’t have an opportunity >>It
it’s right in front of him >>Oh
no, I was trolling, uh Shaggy.

00:19:57.163-->00:20:03.302
>>Oh, okay. >>Well we weren’t
listening to you. >>Surprise,
most I’ve lost half the crowd

00:20:03.302-->00:20:06.705
>>You are droning on and on
>>You’ve been a long f*cking
time of me not talking

00:20:06.705-->00:20:10.409
>>F**cking, f*cking, it’s the
f**king drone village up here.
[speaker laughs] >>Alright,

00:20:10.409-->00:20:15.414
we’re get, we’re getting close.
A drone village, I like that,
yeah. He’s been paying

00:20:15.414-->00:20:20.419
attention. Alright. Um Tara
Wheeler Van Vladtv Ah-Allum um
she said this, about a week ago,

00:20:24.423-->00:20:28.694
two weeks ago, maybe, anyone
worth uh knowing has imposter
syndrome. One of the things

00:20:28.694-->00:20:33.532
that’s very difficult as a uh
being in this industry, is
hanging out with a bunch of

00:20:33.532-->00:20:40.406
really smart people and feeling
like you’re dumb. But you know,
that happens You’re, we’re all

00:20:40.406-->00:20:46.846
smart but we are all noobs too,
so if you’re hanging out with
these guys, who I’m humbled to

00:20:46.846-->00:20:51.083
hang out with, um because of how
smart they are, some of the
people in the front row over

00:20:51.083-->00:20:56.088
here too. Um It-its challenging,
especially when they start
talking about stuff and I’m like

00:20:59.391-->00:21:04.330
yep, I watched football.
[Laughter] Um, but a it’s
alright because just remember,

00:21:07.199-->00:21:11.303
that if you’re hanging out with
those people, you’re hanging out
with them for a reason. You’re

00:21:11.303-->00:21:15.908
not just the guy who pays for
pizza every single time or, or
you know the one who can buy

00:21:15.908-->00:21:20.679
beer, uh they’re hanging out
with you for a specific reason.
>>Because you’re attractive?

00:21:20.679-->00:21:26.785
>>What’s that? >>Because you’re
attractive? >>That’s a stupid
f**king word >>Yes, it could be,

00:21:26.785-->00:21:33.726
I’m the face [Laughter]
>>Alright, so we’re gettin uh um
close to the end for those of

00:21:33.726-->00:21:37.897
you who are excited about
getting close to the end of
this. Um, I am going to issue

00:21:37.897-->00:21:42.801

happens, okay? Cool. I’m really
excited to actually, at the

00:23:53.999-->00:23:59.038
number of people who took the
the time to to talk and
introduce yourself. You’d be

00:23:59.038-->00:24:04.476
shocked at the, how good that is
gonna work out for you, um
getting to know people, getting

00:24:04.476-->00:24:10.215
an opportunity to exchange
information to share people
[laughter] or share with people,

00:24:10.215-->00:24:16.755
you will have an opportunity to
uh actually expand your
knowledge really quick. >>It's

00:24:16.755-->00:24:23.228
great to know that you’re that
open. [speaker laughs] >>Now,
here, here we go. I’m gonna go

00:24:23.228-->00:24:29.368
ahead and up the ante. Do
something that you have never
done before. Go try one of the

00:24:29.368-->00:24:34.773
villages, go to a party. I know
you where you were headed with
that phrasing >>Put a disclaimer

00:24:34.773-->00:24:38.811
on it, come on! >>[laughs] No,
no it’s Vegas, what happens in
Vegas, stays in Vegas >>If it’s

00:24:38.811-->00:24:44.983
illegal, don’t get caught at
Con, at least. >>Yes, that,
please, okay [chuckles] I

00:24:44.983-->00:24:50.289
should, they should’ve been more
specific. When you do something
that you have never done before,

00:24:50.289-->00:24:55.294
please don’t do things that are
illegal. >>Or don’t get caught.
[laughter] >>It is DefCon, hack

00:25:01.133-->00:25:06.138
the law. So, I I would like to
see a show of hands people who
are a-um being nervous, people

00:25:12.244-->00:25:17.716
who have never been here before,
by themselves, and are
uncomfortable introducing

00:25:17.716-->00:25:23.989
themselves. Show of hands. Come
on, this won’t tar, this is not
a target. Come one those those

00:25:23.989-->00:25:28.994
elbows bend, I see a few of you.
Try it, really seriously reach
out. At the very least, you can

00:25:33.165-->00:25:38.804
come up here and you can talk to
the panel. Personally I’m, you
know get scared to death to do

00:25:38.804-->00:25:44.710
that so it’ll be, “Hi, How ya
doing, I’m Mike!” Uncomfortable
silence. [laughter] >>I was

00:25:44.710-->00:25:48.480
wondering what joke I said to
scare you off >>You know we
almost said it on accident

00:25:48.480-->00:25:54.486
>>Thank god, prevented that, but
you were fast too. Alright so
I’d like to introduce you to the

00:25:54.486-->00:26:00.125
panel. Uh, as you go down, they
did not sit in the order that I
have on the slide, so if they

00:26:00.125-->00:26:04.663
could raise their hands.
HighWiz, >>The moderator wasn’t
here at the start of this when

00:26:04.663-->00:26:10.869
we sat down to tell us where to
go, I don’t think you should
blame us. [speaker laughs] >>The

00:26:10.869-->00:26:15.841
next one down is Jericho. Next
down is Suggy, these people’s
real names are then you can um

00:26:15.841-->00:26:17.843
sitting next to Suggy is Romer,
sitting next to Romer is Nikita,
and definitely not the least is

00:26:17.843-->00:26:19.845
Shaggy. >>Especially below the
waste >>Every single one of
these people um since they’ve

00:26:19.845-->00:26:24.850
already mentioned it is on the
call for papers review board,
there are uh many other members

00:26:41.800-->00:26:46.238
of the call for papers review
board >>They don’t count >>we’re
happy to talk about that as well

00:26:46.238-->00:26:51.243
um afterwards. We can give you
advice on how to submit a talk,
how you know you that your talk

00:26:53.779-->00:26:58.450
will immediately get den-
declined um [laughter] you know,
those sort of things. >>It’s a

00:26:58.450-->00:27:04.923
long list. >>It’s a long list.
Um, one of the other things that
I s- I brought up to start, this

00:27:04.923-->00:27:09.928
is our 10th anniversary. So,
what we’re gonna do here. This
is the last DefCon 101 panel.

00:27:14.399-->00:27:20.372
[sparse clap] It’s okay. Because
next year we’re gonna do the
DefCon 101 village. There’s

00:27:20.372-->00:27:25.377
enough [applause] >>Because of
this one thing DefCon needs is
more villages. >>What was that?

00:27:27.980-->00:27:30.582
>>Because DefCon definitely
needs more villages, there are
not enough of that >>They do

00:27:30.582-->00:27:35.854
need more villages. Well the
thing is the the the interesting
thing is there are enough um

00:27:35.854-->00:27:42.361
events and things that just
don’t make it but for noobs it’s
the perfect opportunity >>Nikita

00:27:42.361-->00:27:45.397
just said she did not approve a
DefCon 101 village so [chuckles]
>>What’s that? >>Nikita just

00:27:45.397-->00:27:49.001
said she did not approve a
DefCon 101 village >>Oh yeah we
did not tell her before we put

00:27:49.001-->00:27:51.637
that slide up [speaker laughs]
>>Good luck with your
application. >>We were We were

00:27:51.637-->00:27:56.074
thus the dropping the bomb
thing. Okay. So we have a
tradition, and this will be the

00:27:56.074-->00:28:01.013
last one. Name that noob. Having
a hacker handle is something of
an honor, right? Most people

00:28:04.650-->00:28:10.689
have one for themselves that
they picked out or that they
were given like if you’re uh

00:28:10.689-->00:28:15.694
Shaggy 69435541 because there
were 66-->000 other Shaggy's ahead
of you, um, there are lots of

00:28:21.066-->00:28:26.471
other, other ways to get handles
but earning a handle is a, is a
great way to do it. Um, I’m

00:28:26.471-->00:28:31.710
gonna tell you a quick story and
I’m disappointed because my
friend is not here. But often

00:28:31.710-->00:28:36.715
times, handles are earned by not
doing something smart [laughter]
So I’ve a friend that uh that

00:28:41.053-->00:28:47.225
Romer and I used to work with
many years ago, um and his
handle is Wad. And he hates that

00:28:47.225-->00:28:51.797
handle. He tried a lot of
different ways to get rid of
that handle uh he even tried

00:28:51.797-->00:28:55.434
calling him Rogue Tracker
>>Rogue Tracker [laughs] that
was the f**kin’ [laughter] >>But

00:28:55.434-->00:29:02.040
he spelled it wrong so it was
rouge tracker [laughter] which
of course which of course made

00:29:02.040-->00:29:07.045
it worse But his, so he got the
handle first by um we had to
give a very important demo and

00:29:09.348-->00:29:14.353
we his job was to type in the
password. And he chose to type
in ‘password’. But he left the R

00:29:17.556-->00:29:22.561
out. Twice. [laughter] So he was
Passwod for a quite a quite a
bit of time. Um and then we went

00:29:29.468-->00:29:34.473
to a club a that had a lot of
black lights and >>what kind of
club was it, Mike? >>It was a

00:29:36.942-->00:29:41.947
club that involved dancing.
[laughter] >>Can can you show us
how they danced? [laughter]

00:29:45.150-->00:29:51.757
>>This is at after the party.
Um, and he had a shirt on that
um um we’re gonna go ahead and

00:29:51.757-->00:29:58.597
say that the Tide had not
completely washed out of that
shirt and Romer asked him why he

00:29:58.597-->00:30:03.602
wore he wore his wad shirt to
the club. And he was Wad ever
since and he still is Wad. I say

00:30:08.907-->00:30:14.146
all of this all of this and I
tell you this story because it’s
for fun. When somebody gets a

00:30:14.146-->00:30:20.218
handle, we don’t call you Red
Button um because that’s a
really bad thing to be called.

00:30:20.218-->00:30:27.225
We call you Red Button you
shouldn’t have pressed the red
button. [laughter] >>You know,

00:30:27.225-->00:30:34.066
um, and we are going to pick on
you a little bit. It's not we’re
not gonna call anybody any bad

00:30:34.066-->00:30:40.672
names or anything like that,
this is all in in good fun. And
you’re, you’re you should plan

00:30:40.672-->00:30:47.112
on using your handle from here
forward. So, Shaggy is our
ambassador. I’m gonna have

00:30:47.112-->00:30:52.117
Shaggy go out into the crowd and
pick out 25 people and we are
going to limit it to 25 people.

00:30:54.319-->00:30:58.690
Alright, HighWiz is gonna go out
too. >>They need a handle >>They
need a handle. They need a

00:30:58.690-->00:31:03.628
handle they want a handle and I
really am encouraging people
that are not used to doing this,

00:31:05.997-->00:31:11.002
people that are are um might be
a little bit introverted,
looking for a handle >>Em Mike

00:31:13.238-->00:31:18.210
>>And hopefully it’ll happen
quicker than this. >>Do- does
this signify that the droning of

00:31:18.210-->00:31:22.647
Mike is coming to an end? >>Yes
>>F*cking A >>Drone village
almost over >>Like, just because

00:31:22.647-->00:31:26.017
we have two and a half hours for
this doesn’t mean you need to
make it it needs to feel like an

00:31:26.017-->00:31:32.891
eternity. [off-mic shouting from
audience] >>Okay. You know
while, while they are a

00:31:32.891-->00:31:37.562
identifying some people to come
up here, I’m actually going to
ask the panel a couple of

00:31:37.562-->00:31:41.566
questions, because this is what
I was suppose to do in the first
place. So thank god this is the

00:31:41.566-->00:31:46.571
last one. >>Hey Nikita >>Oh shit
>>Nikita, what’s your favourite
part of DefCon? >>Uh my

00:31:50.942-->00:31:55.947
favourite part of DefCon
actually is believe it or not,
uh the consistency. And that may

00:31:57.949-->00:32:02.888
seem a little unusual because it
is such a chaotic event, but to
me the chaos is consistency and

00:32:05.590-->00:32:10.595
the ability to see all of the
people that I love the most.
Every year I can count on that,

00:32:12.731-->00:32:17.569
and I can count on the show and
count on the energy and all
these people raising their hands

00:32:17.569-->00:32:24.476
and being excited and just
wanting to be at DefCon and
that’s what I love most. The

00:32:24.476-->00:32:30.015
consistency of the show, I love
that the most. >>I think that’s
awesome. Hey Romer, what’s your

00:32:30.015-->00:32:35.020
favorite part of DefCon?
>>Flight home [laughter] [audio
cuts] I really drink a lot. I

00:32:42.460-->00:32:48.600
don’t have that many memories of
DefCon. [laughter] Um, >>That is
true. >>That is true but um nah

00:32:48.600-->00:32:52.370
I don’t know I mean that’s
really difficult. This is uh the
19th DefCon that I’ve been to,

00:32:52.370-->00:32:55.874
so there’s a lot of memories
over that time there’s a lot of
good ones and there’s a lot of

00:32:55.874-->00:33:00.812
really s***ty ones too. Um, but
I would I would I’d say the um
>>Okay >>I I I guess probably if

00:33:03.014-->00:33:09.421
I had to nail it down, probably
my favourite memory is was um is
like selfish which makes sense

00:33:09.421-->00:33:14.626
because I’m severely egotistical
and narcissistic >>What?! >>But
um I I would say probably doing

00:33:14.626-->00:33:19.631
the the goon bandit three oh
three party >>Aww >>Awesome. >>I
did mention it I but I’ll

00:33:25.704-->00:33:31.476
mention it again um if you’re
not one of the lucky people in
this line, come see us

00:33:31.476-->00:33:35.714
afterwards. We’re happy to
listen to you, we’re happy to
talk to you, we’re happy to pick

00:33:35.714-->00:33:42.654
on you and give you a handle.

might want to consider again

00:33:42.654-->00:33:48.326
again I will put it out there
for people that have coins and
want to exchange. You might find

00:33:48.326-->00:33:52.597
that one of the noobs in this
line has a coin. Not everybody
will. We’re going to see how

00:33:52.597-->00:33:56.534

determination. >>I’m start, >>So

mesmerized by that thing, but

that I really like cheese. I’m
also known for taking a lot of

00:48:25.136-->00:48:28.973
notes and I’m very particular so
I actually have a notebook where
I document the cheese that I’ve

00:48:28.973-->00:48:33.978
eaten and I have a personal
rating system for it. [laughter]
>>Listen noob [noob laughs] get

00:48:36.480-->00:48:41.118
into spreadsheets okay, that’s
where it’s at. [laughter] >>I-
You have to bring a notebook to

00:48:41.118-->00:48:44.021
take notes while you’re eating
the cheese and then you go back
home and you enter it in the

00:48:44.021-->00:48:48.225
spreadsheet. >>Okay, yeah, the
last spreadsheet I created was
about tracking jalapeno poppers

00:48:48.225-->00:48:53.464
in Denver and which restaurants
had the best. >>Okay I’m not-
