00:00:00.234-->00:00:04.338
>>So uh you know it takes a lot
to talk in front of all you
guys. And uh we got two newbs

00:00:04.338-->00:00:09.343
today. So let's give it up for
Michael and Colin. [applause]
[presenter whistles] >>Okay,

00:00:23.023-->00:00:28.028
guys. >>So cheers if you got
'em. >>What's in the glass?
>>Whiskey. >>Whiskey. [clinks

00:00:36.503-->00:00:38.505
their glasses] [applause]
>>Alright, welcome everybody.
We're going to be talking today

00:00:38.505-->00:00:43.310
about barc0wned and barcode
scanner hacking. First quick
introduction, even though you

00:00:43.310-->00:00:47.447
probably don't care who we are,
I'm Michael. I'm obsessed with
barcode scanners. As you can

00:00:47.447-->00:00:54.054
see, I have way too many of
them. Um, Colin? >>Hey, I'm
Colin. I do stuff on the web,

00:00:54.054-->00:00:59.693
professionally. [Michael
laughs]. >>He's what we call a
webmaster. [Colin laughs] >>So

00:00:59.693-->00:01:06.099
something we kind of notice and
we may take for granted is that
car codes are everywhere. You

00:01:06.099-->00:01:11.171
might not notice them in real
life, but they really will, they
really kind of permeate

00:01:11.171-->00:01:16.843
everything we buy, everything we
use. And you may think oh
there's some obvious ones.

00:01:16.843-->00:01:21.415
There's a lot of non-obvious
ones. Like, there's 3 barcodes
on that USPS label, there's one

00:01:21.415-->00:01:27.621
on Intel CPUs, there's some on
most printers that print color,
even hospital wristbands. And as

00:01:27.621-->00:01:34.361
a result, because those barcodes
are everywhere, it means the
scanners are everywhere. And so

00:01:34.361-->00:01:38.432
these scanners are basically
just kind of hiding all over the
place. If you go to almost any

00:01:38.432-->00:01:43.203
store, you'll find them, if you
go to an airport, you'll find
them. But they're really an,

00:01:43.203-->00:01:48.141
they're an attack victor. So
before we get into that, let's
just talk about barcodes and

00:01:48.141-->00:01:54.014
kinda what they are. So normally
they decode to text. These are
just a couple of different types

00:01:54.014-->00:01:59.486
of barcodes called symbologies.
Don't to care what they are,
just have to know that they

00:01:59.486-->00:02:03.991
decode to text. Some of them
have restrictions like the UPC
on the right where it can only

00:02:03.991-->00:02:10.197
decode to certain numbers. Some
like PDF417 can hold a lot of
data. And others like QR are

00:02:10.197-->00:02:15.202
really good at being viewed at
weird angles. But the thing is,
these scanners are mostly the

00:02:17.270-->00:02:19.339
same. These manufacturers, this
one, most of these are pictures.
Most of these are symbol

00:02:19.339-->00:02:21.908
scanners and most of them are
vulnerable to attack. They sell,
I mean, look at this. These are

00:02:21.908-->00:02:26.913
about like ten years apart. They
look exactly the same. The
scanner, the equipment inside

00:02:32.019-->00:02:34.021
are pretty much, the controller
inside is based on running the
same software, the same

00:02:34.021-->00:02:37.124
features, year to year. Most of
them will act as an HIE device.
They act a keyboard, they type

00:02:37.124-->00:02:42.129
in the keys, and buffer by, key
by key, they type the buffer
out. So with all these market

00:02:49.836-->00:02:56.176
scanners everywhere acting as
keyboards. What could we do if
we could change the text or send

00:02:56.176-->00:03:01.114
arbitrary keystrokes or do
things like Windows key R? What
could we do with proper

00:03:05.886-->00:03:10.891
permission and a legal sanction
PAN test? So it's not a bug what
this is. A lot of manufacturers

00:03:13.760-->00:03:18.765
will add a lot of special
features in. Code 128, that's
what that barcode right

00:03:20.967-->00:03:25.305
there,that was one of the first
slide. It says FARC underneath
that but there's a hidden

00:03:25.305-->00:03:30.811
character. That one in the red
right there, right after the
start code, is FNC3, which is

00:03:30.811-->00:03:35.682
our best friend in some of these
examples. It tells the scanner
this isn't a normal barcode.

00:03:35.682-->00:03:40.620
This is a programming barcode. A
lot of scanners support this, it
is a little manufacturer

00:03:40.620-->00:03:45.258
specific. And if this is
starting to sound familiar, it's
because this is basically

00:03:45.258-->00:03:50.464
In-band signaling. If you guys
haven't seen the blue locks on
the left, that's that's

00:03:50.464-->00:03:55.469
basically what this is just
modernized. We haven't learned
our lessons from decades ago. So

00:03:57.737-->00:04:02.776
why does this programming exist
that we can do this from? It
mainly exists for legacy

00:04:02.776-->00:04:07.781
systems. So in this example, we
have a legacy system we called
Cyberdyne cat ERP. And we used

00:04:10.150-->00:04:16.123
it to track and herd our cats. A
novel, a noble goal. It's a
little too, it was made a long

00:04:16.123-->00:04:19.759
ago, nobody wants to replace it,
nobody wants to modify it, it's
way too expensive. It's probably

00:04:19.759-->00:04:23.296
4 trillion or something. But
we've been told to make it
faster. So we wanna make it

00:04:23.296-->00:04:27.768
faster with barcodes. This is
actually a real fake example.
There is actually a C sharp

00:04:27.768-->00:04:32.105
program running in the
background that we uh create
just to show this off cuz I

00:04:32.105-->00:04:39.012
don't know how to program in
Fortran. So here we have my cat
Java. Um, he's a domestic short

00:04:39.012-->00:04:44.017
hair, he's born like 2005ish.
And our system wants those three
inputs. And so normally we would

00:04:46.186-->00:04:52.626
have to look at the label on the
cat, grab their name, type it in
manually, press tab, type in the

00:04:52.626-->00:04:58.999
breed, press tab, type in the
year, and finally we hit F12 to
save. Well that takes a lot of

00:04:58.999-->00:05:04.571
work, there's a lot of room for
error, and it's generally just
kind of slow. So what if we

00:05:04.571-->00:05:11.511
solved that by bar coding our
cats because how could that go
wrong? So we create a barcode

00:05:11.511-->00:05:17.817
like the one on the upper right
that says DSH, domestic
short-hair, 2005 Java. Now we've

00:05:17.817-->00:05:22.889
got this barcode. We can't
modify the ERPA to know
barcodes. It's just like I

00:05:22.889-->00:05:27.561
expect a keyboard and that's it.
And so these rules that we
generate, they're gonna go a

00:05:27.561-->00:05:33.300
little bit like this. So first
we got a cursor and we've got a
buffer of the actual scanned

00:05:33.300-->00:05:39.105
barcode. And you see, we've got,
we're starting at right before D
or on D. So we move the cursor

00:05:39.105-->00:05:45.712
forward a little bit and now we
move it forward 7 characters. 7
characters are a defined length

00:05:45.712-->00:05:50.584
for how big those two fields can
be. And then the rest of the
barcode is the cat's name. So we

00:05:50.584-->00:05:54.321
could have a name that's 8
characters long, 12 characters
long, doesn't matter. And now

00:05:54.321-->00:06:00.193
we're at this cursor point, we
send that info and we press tab.
And you see it types it for us

00:06:00.193-->00:06:06.867
and moves to the next field. Now
we go back because the next
field is DSH or breed, which is

00:06:06.867-->00:06:13.206
DSH. The cursor moves back to
the front, we type in 3
characters and we hit tab.

00:06:13.206-->00:06:16.343
Again, it doesn't matter what
those characters are, we're just
typing 3 characters from the

00:06:16.343-->00:06:22.182
buffer. And then same thing, the
buffer's, cursor's already moved
forward for us, so all we do is

00:06:22.182-->00:06:27.621
type 4 characters and we hit
F12. And it saves it for us. So
all you have to do is do one

00:06:27.621-->00:06:33.293
quick scan on this legacy system
that nobody knows how to modify
and we can actually automate

00:06:33.293-->00:06:37.264
that. That's why these rules
exist, that's why manufacturers
added them 20 or so years ago.

00:06:37.264-->00:06:42.269
And so we're back at that, we've
put our barcode on our cat, uh,
which is a very successful

00:06:44.271-->00:06:51.011
endeavor, I might add. And we're
gonna just do a scan. So this is
what the scan looks like, simple

00:06:51.011-->00:06:56.016
as that. It's extremely fast, a
lot less error prone. But of
course, we can make our own

00:06:58.718-->00:07:03.290
malicious rules, we can make our
own malicious programming. So we
can do all sorts of things. We

00:07:03.290-->00:07:08.361
can specify criteria for these
rules. So we can say just do it
on everything, do it on certain

00:07:08.361-->00:07:14.868
barcodes, ones that have a
certain text to it, or a certain
symbologies, like EPC. Or, and

00:07:14.868-->00:07:18.905
then once we're done with that,
we can specify actions. So you
can see here on the left that

00:07:18.905-->00:07:24.911
is, er the right, that is the
actual programming barcode for
that cat ERP system. So if you

00:07:24.911-->00:07:30.083
scan that with this scanner,
it'll do that. A lot of these
scanners can actually support

00:07:30.083-->00:07:34.487
multiple rules, as we'll see
later. They do have a size
limit, but it's fairly

00:07:34.487-->00:07:38.725
expansive. You can't write a
novel on power show, like you
can't write in the hundreds of

00:07:38.725-->00:07:44.397
characters, but you can get a
lot in. These are some of the
actions we can do, some of the

00:07:44.397-->00:07:50.270
ideas. So we can modify and
replace text on the fly. We can
just ignore text, so you scan

00:07:50.270-->00:07:55.575
something that doesn't actually
give you any text. We can add
extra characters at the end, we

00:07:55.575-->00:08:01.448
can do special keys, like
Windows control alt, and we can
just do nothing. We can soft

00:08:01.448-->00:08:05.418
brick scanners by scanning a
rule that says do nothing, and
the scanner is dead until you

00:08:05.418-->00:08:09.756
reset it to default. There's a
classic attack you guys have
probably heard of it, of like,

00:08:09.756-->00:08:14.127
you know, into the Wal-Marts,
where you put a sticker over the
barcode with a different barcode

00:08:14.127-->00:08:19.399
for something cheaper, but it's
super obvious like that. This is
a digital equivalent of that. We

00:08:19.399-->00:08:24.404
can change those barcodes on the
fly, make your 200 dollar item
ring up as 10 bucks. So this

00:08:26.406-->00:08:33.380
culminates in our tool called
barcOwned. BarcOwned is an
attack IDE developed by Colin in

00:08:33.380-->00:08:39.419
JavaScript. We developed
payloads in JSON and it makes it
really easy to rap-rapidly

00:08:39.419-->00:08:44.190
design them. See, these barcode
scanners they don't give you a
lot of feedback, if you give it

00:08:44.190-->00:08:50.196
something invalid, they just go,
they give a nuh, a bad beep
instead of a good beep. And

00:08:50.196-->00:08:54.534
that's all. You don't have any
feedback, there's no out put,
there's no logs. Trying to do

00:08:54.534-->00:09:01.107
these barcodes manually is
possible but literally spent the
past year working on that. So

00:09:01.107-->00:09:07.580
this makes it easy for you guys
to just write some JSON, it's
little harder than Ducky Script.

00:09:07.580-->00:09:13.052
You know, Ducky Script, it it's
kinda basic. This allows you to
do a lot more, but um, but this

00:09:13.052-->00:09:16.990
takes away all the complexity of
doing those barcodes. And you
don't have to decipher any

00:09:16.990-->00:09:22.462
manuals. Right now so far as
simba-symbol, which I think is
like 40 percent of the market,

00:09:22.462-->00:09:27.934
um, most of the scanners support
this like Honeywell, NCR. And
it's open source under the MIT

00:09:27.934-->00:09:32.272
license. Here on the right you
can see just a simple
this-is-how-we-run calculator.

00:09:32.272-->00:09:37.277
So let's show the demo.
[laughter] >> Hmm, first demos.
Run calc. This is the barcOwned

00:09:48.121-->00:09:53.259
website, BarcOwned dot com, it's
live right now. Quick home page
right there and it takes us into

00:09:53.259-->00:09:59.999
a quick ID. First thing we're
gonna do is run calc. I know
this text is a little small but

00:09:59.999-->00:10:05.004
don't worry about it. So you see
on the bottom we have
exclamation point calc. What we,

00:10:07.574-->00:10:13.313
that basically defined as a rule
where if a barcode starts with
exclamation point, we go press

00:10:13.313-->00:10:19.118
Windows key R, we press enter,
and when we run, we type in that
command and press enter. So this

00:10:19.118-->00:10:25.825
basically allows us to easily
build new payloads by just
having a simple rule. So this is

00:10:25.825-->00:10:30.497
an example. Let's scan it, this
this scanner is fresh, it's
reset to default. Here's what it

00:10:30.497-->00:10:37.003
looks like just by itself. Types
in exclamation point calc. And
here's what happens if we scan

00:10:37.003-->00:10:42.008
that programming barcode. You
hear it had a programming noise?
[applause and cheers] >>Full

00:10:49.048-->00:10:54.053
screen calc, my favorite
[chuckles]. So let's go and try
another demo. Next one is wrung

00:11:02.595-->00:11:08.001
command. And so we, that's what
the quick iteration looks like.
We just go back, click some

00:11:08.001-->00:11:11.271
things up here. We can change
things up up here. We can change
all this text really easy on the

00:11:11.271-->00:11:16.276
fly. So what we're gonna do is
were just gonna run this one.
This one has two rules. Gonna

00:11:19.812-->00:11:24.817
scan that. It programs it, and
next let's launch command. And
now we just have a command

00:11:27.720-->00:11:32.292
propped open. We have extra
barcodes. So we can just type in
that user. So we can actually

00:11:32.292-->00:11:37.430
type in text in a line by line.
So you can have a list of
one-liners that you really love

00:11:37.430-->00:11:42.435
and just use them over and over
again. And a quick iteration of
stuff like this, you can go and

00:11:44.637-->00:11:49.642
say, you know, net user adds,
and just go click like that,
click run, now we can type user

00:11:55.949-->00:12:00.887
add. Next up, do the serial box
to know. So right here we've got
an unalt-an unaltered box of

00:12:05.124-->00:12:09.696
s'mores. It's a little smashed
from travel here from Dallas,
but it's got a barcode on the

00:12:09.696-->00:12:16.636
bottom. Simply BC barcode. We're
gonna execute an attack with
that barcode. So first let's

00:12:16.636-->00:12:21.641
demonstrate that we scan this,
it types in a barcode. Next
let's scan the programming

00:12:23.710-->00:12:28.715
barcode. There we go. Let's prep
ourselves. We've already got
Metasploit running right here,

00:12:36.489-->00:12:41.494
just waiting for our reversal.
So let's scan this barcode and
see what happens. [laughter] >>

00:12:52.038-->00:12:57.043
Oh come on, you can do it. We
had to change our webpost at
like 2am and it's super slow

00:12:59.345-->00:13:05.084
right now. But it's working, it
should. Just give it time. There
we go! And we're gonna switch

00:13:05.084-->00:13:10.089
over to this window. [applause]
>> So that's all great. That's
all serious. But, you know, what

00:13:19.298-->00:13:23.670
if we just really wanna play
some video games? What if we're
really feeling down for

00:13:23.670-->00:13:28.675
something more fun? So let's
play some Tetris. So right here
we'll scan this barcode. It can

00:13:31.277-->00:13:35.281
be a little tricky with the
glare on the screen, stage. So
there we go, we've got Tetris.

00:13:35.281-->00:13:40.286
We'll put that over here. And
we've got photos. [laughter]
>>So. [more laughter] >>

00:13:55.268-->00:14:00.206
Basically we've invented the
world's shadiest way to play
Tetris. [laughter and applause]

00:14:09.716-->00:14:15.388
>>[speaker laughs] [applause]
>>And finally let's just show
off what we can do with a little

00:14:15.388-->00:14:20.393
bit of mayhem. So we'll go back
to our brick payload. So there's
the program bar-barcode at the

00:14:28.501-->00:14:35.408
top. So right now, if I scan any
of that barcode, it's gonna scan
the cereal box demo, but if we

00:14:35.408-->00:14:40.947
scan this one simple programming
barcode, we're basically telling
the scanner whenever you get a

00:14:40.947-->00:14:47.186
barcode, just leave for 20
seconds and then don't print
anything. Any barcode. So let's

00:14:47.186-->00:14:53.826
try and scan the cereal box
again. If you can't tell, this
thing is not lighting up, it's

00:14:53.826-->00:14:57.897
just sitting there for 20
seconds doing nothing. It looks
like it's powered off, the

00:14:57.897-->00:15:02.802
light's off, the button doesn't
do anything. It'll just sit for
20 seconds and wait. And the

00:15:02.802-->00:15:08.207
only way to reset it is to go to
the factory defaults, which
almost no one knows how to do.

00:15:08.207-->00:15:13.179
So once we give it 20 seconds to
go through, um, it looks like
it's dead. You scan this one

00:15:13.179-->00:15:18.184
barcode, it's basically a zombie
for that 20 seconds, we've tried
up to like 1 and a half minutes

00:15:21.254-->00:15:26.259
before we got bored, so now if
our scanner goes to defaults, we
can go back and scan all the

00:15:28.494-->00:15:33.499
barcodes we want. But almost no
one knows how to do that. And
that whole thing about we find a

00:15:38.404-->00:15:43.409
lot of barcodes hiding
everywhere? Well, alright. First
let's talk about this.So, first,

00:15:46.412-->00:15:52.451
can you turn it off? And the
answer is yes! You can scan that
barcode to disable barOwning

00:15:52.451-->00:15:57.456
barcodes. Can anyone guess how
you turn them back on?
[laughter] >>So some

00:16:07.433-->00:16:13.372
considerations for red team
attack. Um, this is really, this
is an advanced attack. You can't

00:16:13.372-->00:16:18.744
just walk into a Wal-Mart and
just pull something from your
phone and hit enter and hope

00:16:18.744-->00:16:24.884
something exploits it. This is
something that takes a lot of
testing, a lot of recon, but it

00:16:24.884-->00:16:29.856
allows some windows into systems
that normally you wouldn't be
able to access. They don't have

00:16:29.856-->00:16:34.293
keyboards, they are controlled,
you only have access to the
barcode or maybe you're not even

00:16:34.293-->00:16:40.833
there. Maybe you send a package
with a malicious barcode. One
thing to think about, find the

00:16:40.833-->00:16:45.371
beeper hole and cover it up
because the programming barcode,
at least on symbol scanners,

00:16:45.371-->00:16:48.975
they actually play at full
volume. Some of you guys can
even hear it in the audience. I

00:16:48.975-->00:16:54.380
have it taped over, but it's
really loud. So just cover that
up. Another good example is, you

00:16:54.380-->00:16:58.818
can actually bring your own
scanner. These things all, most
all of these scanners have the

00:16:58.818-->00:17:03.756
same 10B10C connector, ethernet
with 2 extra pins. And you can
just slide in a screwdriver,

00:17:06.225-->00:17:12.431
unclick it, and bring our own
scanner. Or steal a scanner and
replace it, and then test with

00:17:12.431-->00:17:16.669
that one. So you can actually
program your malicious barcode
scanner, bring it into the

00:17:16.669-->00:17:23.409
store, swap it out real quick
and you don't even have to scan
a barcode. One great thing,

00:17:23.409-->00:17:27.046
there's a great example in the
next slide. Even when the
scanners are turned off, a lot

00:17:27.046-->00:17:31.183
of them are still powered. Most
of these aren't actually doing
anything but they're almost all

00:17:31.183-->00:17:36.455
still powered. So you can still
program them even if the
terminal's off. Another thing,

00:17:36.455-->00:17:42.862
laser scanners like this one
from probably before I was born,
no not that really, this one's a

00:17:42.862-->00:17:47.300
laser scanner, the ones they
have in like Wal-Mart and the
end counter checkouts. This

00:17:47.300-->00:17:52.305
one's actually end counter.
Right here, spinning laser beam
of death. Those ones won't work

00:17:54.340-->00:17:59.178
with phones. You gotta have a
Kindle, paper, something like
that. And we have some great

00:17:59.178-->00:18:05.284
ideas with, you can trick others
to deliver these barcodes. For
example, maybe you're at

00:18:05.284-->00:18:11.857
airport. And you just airdrop
someone and say hi, I'm United
Airlines. Have this barcode for

00:18:11.857-->00:18:16.862
your free upgrade. [laughter]
That's actually the cat PR
code.Or you know p-Pet Smart.

00:18:20.499-->00:18:25.504
Just send a fake email to
someone and hopefully they do
it. Literally a minute after I

00:18:28.941-->00:18:34.680
walked off the plane at Vegas,
in the airport, came across that
scene on the left, unattended

00:18:34.680-->00:18:38.351
little coffee shop, the
machine's powered off,
everything's locked up, probably

00:18:38.351-->00:18:44.090
the cash is gone, but we've got
a powered scanner right there.
No one's watching this so we can

00:18:44.090-->00:18:48.995
just go scan barcodes all we
want because you can program
them. And then the one on the

00:18:48.995-->00:18:55.034
right is uh percentage without
comment from Piso's, if anyone's
been there. They even posed with

00:18:55.034-->00:18:57.903
their bar scanner for me. They
probably would have let me scan
some barcodes if I had asked.

00:19:00.773-->00:19:05.778
For the blue team. I don't have
good news for you. [laughter]
>>As far as I know, there is no

00:19:07.913-->00:19:12.718
way to secure these scanners
from programming. The only
benefit you have is that some

00:19:12.718-->00:19:18.491
models may not support it. Some
really really old ones may not
support it. All the new ones do.

00:19:18.491-->00:19:23.362
So you just have to assume that
anything that has a barcode
control. I shouldn't be able to

00:19:23.362-->00:19:26.432
type Windows key R and get an
admin prompt but a lot times you
can, especially on these

00:19:26.432-->00:19:28.968
unattended kiosks. And there's
some good ideas about filtering
malicious keys at the OS level.

00:19:28.968-->00:19:33.973
So you can just say if this
device has a scanner type, then
don't allow any like Windows

00:19:49.722-->00:19:55.761
keys or super keys. Or we can
just enforce non-HID modes.
These will transport or serial

00:19:55.761-->00:19:59.565
port. You can use a barcode to
change them into a keyboard
though, so you gotta enforce

00:19:59.565-->00:20:05.738
that at an eDev level. Anyway,
we're gonna wrap it up with some
special thanks to Terry Burton

00:20:05.738-->00:20:09.809
at BWIPP who made some
last-minute changes and helped
us a lot. Mark Warren made the

00:20:09.809-->00:20:14.713
BWIP in JS version. Hermit,
thanks for the shirts. Dallas
Hackers, thanks for all your

00:20:14.713-->00:20:18.250
help and support. This talk was
actually kind of boring there.
And thanks CyberArk for the

00:20:18.250-->00:20:22.955
travel and support. If anyone's
looking for some interested
talks, related talks, these are

00:20:22.955-->00:20:28.694
some good examples. Um, there,
none of them really go into this
depth of building a tool, but

00:20:28.694-->00:20:34.600
they give some great details
about barcodes and how they
work. And there is our site.

00:20:34.600-->00:20:39.605
There is the GitHub link. And QR
codes trust me, they're safe.
[laughter] [applause]
