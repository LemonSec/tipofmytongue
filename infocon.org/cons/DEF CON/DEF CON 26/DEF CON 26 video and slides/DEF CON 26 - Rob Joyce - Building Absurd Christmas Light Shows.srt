00:00:00.000-->00:00:06.607
>>Alright so, come uh come fall,
when you look out your window
and you see your neighbor

00:00:06.607-->00:00:11.678
crawling up on their roof and
they’re running wires and things
like that, and your significant

00:00:11.678-->00:00:17.217
other just happens to say boy I
wonder if those are Christmas
lights or if they’re setting up

00:00:17.217-->00:00:21.989
some sort of surveillance
station [laughter] and uh maybe
the neighbor is spying on us

00:00:21.989-->00:00:28.762
all. I think what you’re going
to hear today is maybe that’s
true. So, uh, without further

00:00:28.762-->00:00:35.002
ado, uh Rob who um, does
something for the-for the
Federal government uh is going

00:00:35.002-->00:00:39.940
to talk to us about his
elaborate set up for Christmas
lights, let’s give him a big

00:00:39.940-->00:00:44.945
round of applause. [applause]
have a great time. >>thank you.
Hi, thank you everybody for

00:00:48.682-->00:00:53.954
turning out yeah its uh strange
to be in Vegas and thing about
Christmas lights uh in the

00:00:53.954-->00:00:59.359
middle of August, but for me,
this actually is a year round
activity, getting ready to build

00:00:59.359-->00:01:05.198
and uh do Christmas displays.
And so what I’m hoping here uh
buy the end is you understand

00:01:05.198-->00:01:10.003
kind of the- the basic
components of it and uh have a
little bit of an inspiration and

00:01:10.003-->00:01:13.907
passion maybe go out and take
care of the fact that you’re
here at DefCon uh might be

00:01:13.907-->00:01:20.347
interested in some of this stuff
and uh I think that it’s well
within the-the capability of all

00:01:20.347-->00:01:24.117
of you to um to build an absurd
Christmas light show [background
music playing] so this is my

00:01:24.117-->00:01:30.691
house, >>[recording on slide
speaks and says] ho, ho, ho,
Merry Christmas from our family

00:01:30.691-->00:01:35.696
to yours >>It’s subtle and
understated [music changes to
charlie brown theme] so, there’s

00:01:40.500-->00:01:45.505
a number of elements throughout
this, all of them are rgb leds
I’ll talk more to that

00:01:54.348-->00:01:59.353
throughout the talk, um the
actual controller that is
orchestrating all of these

00:02:01.788-->00:02:06.793
maneuvers is a single raspberry
pi. So, pretty cool stuff. So,
the basic elements if you’re

00:02:11.865-->00:02:18.572
going to build one of these, um,
you certainly have to have LEDs,
um lots and lots of LEDs uh the

00:02:18.572-->00:02:24.011
power supplies are a
challenge,um, not because it’s
huge amounts of power, um but

00:02:24.011-->00:02:28.548
they’ve got to be outside in the
weather. Um, where I live you
know, North East, we’ve got the

00:02:28.548-->00:02:33.553
the full range, it could be 80
degrees, it could be 5 degrees
um and there’s always

00:02:36.590-->00:02:41.261
precipitation whether it’s rain,
sleet, snow. Um, so there’s
something, so, so the things

00:02:41.261-->00:02:45.565
you’re putting out have to
consider the elements in that
space. Um, so there’s a, there’s

00:02:45.565-->00:02:50.871
a number of ways to do
waterproof cases, people do
things uh um as simple as tackle

00:02:50.871-->00:02:55.876
boxes, and some um adapting
pelican cases or there’s a
series of boxes you can get um

00:02:58.111-->00:03:03.250
for meant to be junction boxes
for telephone and cable that
would mount to your house. Um,

00:03:03.250-->00:03:09.456
you’ve got to worry about the
cabling uh there’s a, there’s an
element, so the white box I have

00:03:09.456-->00:03:15.095
up here is a pixel controller
and we’ll talk more about those
but that essentially takes um

00:03:15.095-->00:03:21.268
the network commands and gets
them to the protocols that are
needed to drive the lights. All

00:03:21.268-->00:03:27.007
of this is controlled with
sequencing software, so um some
people think they drive up, see

00:03:27.007-->00:03:32.179
that display, and what they
believe is you know, the the
audio is playing, the lights are

00:03:32.179-->00:03:36.283
blinking, there is some computer
algorithm running in the
background deciding which lights

00:03:36.283-->00:03:41.388
to turn on and off, that’s not
the case, you actually have to
control each and every LED in

00:03:41.388-->00:03:46.393
time and I’ll show you the
software we use to do that. Um,
the show controller and software

00:03:48.495-->00:03:52.866
I remembered that was a
raspberry pi in my case, and the
thing that almost always

00:03:52.866-->00:03:58.438
impresses the average non
technical person is I have a
radio station, you drive up, you

00:03:58.438-->00:04:03.910
tune your FM radio to a channel
and you get to hear the music
that accompanies the lights. Um,

00:04:03.910-->00:04:09.950
they’re so impressed that I’m
running a radio station. But
that really is just, it’s-it’s a

00:04:09.950-->00:04:15.689
purchase, you plug it in and it
goes and we’ll talk we’ll we’ll
talk some about that but it

00:04:15.689-->00:04:18.959
essentially takes the headphone
out of your-your computer and uh
puts it out onto the FM dial.

00:04:18.959-->00:04:24.197
And everything is run, managed
and attached with tons of zip
ties. So the traditional mil-

00:04:24.197-->00:04:29.202
mini lights a lot of us grew up
with, little incandescent bulbs,
they’re not very um energy

00:04:31.838-->00:04:36.843
efficient, they heat up a wire
to make light, they’re painted
to get the color um and uh you

00:04:43.383-->00:04:48.321
know you grew up thinking about
how the the local power company
would spin your dial when you’re

00:04:48.321-->00:04:54.227
running massive amounts of
Christmas lights. Technology’s
come a long way and now

00:04:54.227-->00:05:00.667
everything in my display is LED
driven, and there uh, you know
DefCons been good enough to give

00:05:00.667-->00:05:06.339
all of us examples of these, but
the, the basic element in all of
this is an LED chip that has 3

00:05:06.339-->00:05:08.341
different color LEDs on one
substrate, a red, a green and a
blue, and they’re in such close

00:05:08.341-->00:05:10.343
proximity that your eye sees
them as one pixel. So what they
actually do, it’s like shining 3

00:05:10.343-->00:05:12.345
flashlights together, so you
make additive colors, so you, um
by varying the intensity of each

00:05:12.345-->00:05:14.347
of those 3 colors, you can
create across the spectrum and
actually add together to get

00:05:14.347-->00:05:16.349
almost any color in the visible
spectrum. You can go from off
all the way out to all 3 on

00:05:16.349-->00:05:18.351
gives you white and then you can
get in between the various
shades um and the software

00:05:18.351-->00:05:20.353
controls all of that. So when
these pixels first came out they
were called smart RGB as opposed

00:05:20.353-->00:05:22.355
to just RGB because what they
had was a small controller chip,
if you look inside um the one

00:05:22.355-->00:05:24.357
LED that’s running horizontally
you can see a black um
integrated circuit thats mounted

00:05:24.357-->00:05:29.362
there to control those 3 LEDs,
and that was the thing that
takes 3 signals, um it takes uh

00:06:22.782-->00:06:27.887
an intensity for red, an
intensity for green and an
intensity for blue and converts

00:06:27.887-->00:06:34.261
those digital values out to um
the intensity of the LEDs. So
the smart LEDs lets you send a

00:06:34.261-->00:06:40.000
command to each pixel and change
its color individually. So you
can see on that bundle of

00:06:40.000-->00:06:45.005
strings, um and I’ll show you
later in a demo if the demo gods
help me um we’ll we’ll see that

00:06:47.407-->00:06:51.811
you can individually change
colors along that string, they
don’t all have to be the same

00:06:51.811-->00:06:56.816
color and remain the same color.
So, that integrated circuit
comes in multiple forms, um I

00:06:59.352-->00:07:05.592
have the-the white strip running
down the display, it’s also the
rolled up reel in the uh, in the

00:07:05.592-->00:07:12.432
video image that’s uh that’s a
form where that’s a flexible
printed circuit card, um the

00:07:12.432-->00:07:18.471
chip is separate and then you
can see 2 LEDs with 1 controller
chip, two white boxes with each

00:07:18.471-->00:07:23.009
controller chip, um there’s a
lot of different form factors
today they’re starting to

00:07:23.009-->00:07:28.014
integrate um the actual LED onto
the same substrate as the
controller chip. So, the way

00:07:31.618-->00:07:37.557
they work, um, it’s a serial
protocol so I don’t have to have
an address for each and every um

00:07:37.557-->00:07:43.963
pixel, you can extend the
strings out um indefinitely, now
there’s some realistic um

00:07:43.963-->00:07:48.668
limitations to the amount of
power you can push down the
string. Um, but what happens, is

00:07:48.668-->00:07:53.840
3 values come out and then
they’re followed by 3 more
values, 3 more values and you

00:07:53.840-->00:07:59.279
can think of it like a stack of
colored lego blocks, so the
first pixel controller they hit

00:07:59.279-->00:08:06.052
will grab that first set of 3
colors, um instructions, pull it
off the top and display it and

00:08:06.052-->00:08:11.057
then it’ll push out the rest of
the stack onto the next pixel in
the chain. So it-it-it first in

00:08:13.593-->00:08:19.866
first out, but it strips that
first one off the head and uh
and moves them down the line. So

00:08:19.866-->00:08:25.839
um for my display every 50
milliseconds there’s a color
going into every pixel in that

00:08:25.839-->00:08:31.411
display. So there are huge
amounts of data moving through
the uh um through the network um

00:08:31.411-->00:08:37.684
and out to these- out to these
strings. The good news is, as
tinkerers and hobbyists you

00:08:37.684-->00:08:42.489
don’t have to understand this
protocol, you can dig in and if
you really want to get hard core

00:08:42.489-->00:08:47.560
and build the hardware yourself
um you can generate these serial
protocols you can learn about

00:08:47.560-->00:08:52.332
how to talk to the strings um,
but there’s a lot of smart folks
who have already built the

00:08:52.332-->00:08:56.770
controller cards and built the
hardware um and make it
available either in finished

00:08:56.770-->00:09:01.708
form or kit forms um that you
can play with. So, at the core
of my display, are these um, are

00:09:06.212-->00:09:12.852
these elements and I’m sorry I’m
going the wrong way in there. Um
so what you see and if you walk

00:09:12.852-->00:09:19.259
up afterwards I’m going to go to
the chill out lounge and you can
look at some of the tech up

00:09:19.259-->00:09:24.764
close but there’s multiple form
factors for the LEDs. The bottom
center is uh known as a bullet

00:09:24.764-->00:09:30.336
pixel, um they look like a small
bullet you can push them through
um display items and mount them

00:09:30.336-->00:09:35.341
that way. The square nodes um
have ears for you to uh to screw
down, and the strips themselves

00:09:38.478-->00:09:43.483
are flexible and can be tie
wrapped and uh and attached to
different things. In

00:09:47.020-->00:09:51.958
customizing, you’ve got to cut
these up, you’ve got to string
them for your specific display,

00:09:51.958-->00:09:56.963
you’ve got to adapt them to your
house. My, the-the run along my
eaves is gonna be, is gonna be

00:09:59.199-->00:10:03.736
different than my neighbors
house, is going to be different
than anybody else’s house. So in

00:10:03.736-->00:10:07.807
the end, you wind up chopping
these to various lengths adding
them together, a lot of

00:10:07.807-->00:10:12.712
soldering, soldering brings a
core techn or a core skill you
will need to do if you’re into

00:10:12.712-->00:10:18.151
the hobby. Um, build and put
things together and we also
connectorize most of the things,

00:10:18.151-->00:10:22.956
you saw me assembling up her
frantically before the demo um
to get everything together. Um,

00:10:22.956-->00:10:27.961
plugging in and having
waterproof connectors, um on the
on the display, allows you to

00:10:30.163-->00:10:35.235
tear it down store it, put it
away um for the uh for the
season. So, my house has a

00:10:35.235-->00:10:41.841
series of custom elements that I
have built. So the story about
how I got into this, um started

00:10:41.841-->00:10:47.914
a number of years ago 5 or 6
years ago, we were going by a
house in a neighborhood and they

00:10:47.914-->00:10:53.152
had um just a fabulous show.
They had lights on the house,
they had the FM radio tune, they

00:10:53.152-->00:10:58.157
had really cool um elements all
synchronized, I looked at it and
I said “that is neat”. Right?

00:11:05.131-->00:11:11.304
Computer geeky guy, I-I was
excited, my wife loved kind of
the way it moved and captured

00:11:11.304-->00:11:17.410
everybody’s attention, I said “I
think I can do that”, an she
looked and turned and said

00:11:17.410-->00:11:22.415
“sure, sure you can.” So, I
heard, yes, yes you can
[laughter] and so when the boxes

00:11:26.653-->00:11:31.724
started showing up in February
from China with piece parts, and
she’s like what the h**l is

00:11:31.724-->00:11:36.729
this? I said, “It’s the
Christmas light display you said
I could do” [laughter]. Alright,

00:11:39.632-->00:11:43.903
so those of you that didn’t
bring your spouse, you can go
home, boxes will start showing

00:11:43.903-->00:11:50.476
up. Um, it’s expanded and built
over the years so as I mentioned
there’s a bunch of elements,

00:11:50.476-->00:11:55.615
each one of those is um
individually designed and
there’s no big you get that will

00:11:55.615-->00:12:00.553
uh set up your house um, so the
first year I did it um I had the
outlines along the house um that

00:12:06.392-->00:12:13.366
was um this flexible strip
mounted to pvc pipes and zip
tied to the eaves, zip tied to

00:12:13.366-->00:12:18.371
the pillars things like that, so
all of the outline of the house,
those 3 swooping arches are um

00:12:20.773-->00:12:27.180
are pvc pipe with lights strung
through the inside of them and
they kind of defuse, um those

00:12:27.180-->00:12:32.452
were part of the first year and
then the star um down on the
ground the large red and white

00:12:32.452-->00:12:37.657
star that you see, um my son
dubbed that the seizure star
cause all of these elements I

00:12:37.657-->00:12:41.427
didn’t know how to do them I
didn’t know how they’d work, so
I had all this stuff in my

00:12:41.427-->00:12:45.331
basement and I was tinkering
throughout the year to get it to
work, to get it to look right to

00:12:45.331-->00:12:51.270
understand how they would work
and that thing is amazingly
bright. All of this is actually

00:12:51.270-->00:12:57.944
pretty incredibly bright if your
4, 5, 6, feet away um so tested
it in the basement um, it was

00:12:57.944-->00:13:04.384
uh, it was a blinding
experience. So we had those, um
that was the first year um and

00:13:04.384-->00:13:09.389
I’m sorry, the small trees in
the very front, so those are
chicken wi- or those are um

00:13:11.557-->00:13:17.897
tomato cages, upside down and
then lights wrapped around them.
And there’s 10 of those, so I

00:13:17.897-->00:13:22.802
had those as the basic element
and it looked pretty cool. It
was a, it was a nice set up but

00:13:22.802-->00:13:26.739
it’s a little bit of an
addiction, so every year it’s
gotta be a little bigger, a

00:13:26.739-->00:13:31.744
little better. Um, I wound up
second year, um, I added the
floodlights if you notice the

00:13:35.014-->00:13:41.254
green kind of painting the house
uh those are 3 flood lights on
the top, 3 flood lights on the

00:13:41.254-->00:13:46.192
bottom, those also are RBG
they’re controlled the same way
those are just a single pixel to

00:13:46.192-->00:13:51.631
the computer um and they bring
so much more depth uh to this
display so I was really happy to

00:13:51.631-->00:13:57.203
add those. Um, and I’m sorry the
Christmas trees were a second
year add, so the second year was

00:13:57.203-->00:14:02.141
the small trees and the uh flood
lights. Um, third year saw me
add a number of things, which is

00:14:06.713-->00:14:11.884
to include that-that large tree
and I’ll talk more about that
tree on the side that’s the one

00:14:11.884-->00:14:16.889
you saw with the uh, with the
graphics running on it and then
over my garage is a uh small

00:14:20.760-->00:14:26.766
matrix sign that I can run text
and pictures and abstract
colors,um that’s actually a

00:14:26.766-->00:14:32.772
large amount of pixels in a very
dense form factor, I’ll talk to
those. And then, up along the

00:14:32.772-->00:14:37.777
top row you can see the
snowflakes, those are uh
purchased items, um their their

00:14:41.013-->00:14:46.018
pre cut from plastic corrugated
cardboard, plasticized
corrugated cardboard um it’s

00:14:48.054-->00:14:52.759
called corro and there’s
companies that will cut them,
laser cut them and pre drill

00:14:52.759-->00:14:58.030
them so you push those bullet
pixels through the center and
then um you can include those in

00:14:58.030-->00:15:03.369
your display. You can do a lot
of patterns on them and around
them. Similarly the small wreath

00:15:03.369-->00:15:08.374
on the first floor is another
piece is another piece of coro
um with pushed through pieces.

00:15:08.374-->00:15:14.213
So, those are the-the elements
I’ve done um last year I added
no hardware, I was working at

00:15:14.213-->00:15:19.886
the white house, I had no time,
but I added software. Um, so
when you get a base amount, it’s

00:15:19.886-->00:15:25.124
really easy from year to year to
add a little thing here, a
little think there um and uh

00:15:25.124-->00:15:31.898
increment the display. So, I
talked about the tree on the
side um those are those are

00:15:31.898-->00:15:36.903
known as mega trees, um its uh,
it’s pixel strings, and it lets
us do animation and effects,

00:15:39.071-->00:15:44.076
it’s in essence a low resolution
matrix mine is um 50 pixels
tall, um 32 pixels wide, and

00:15:47.747-->00:15:53.352
it’s 14 feet tall. So, let me go
back and put that into
perspective, um so that’s 14

00:15:53.352-->00:15:58.724
feet, it’s taller than the first
story of my house, it really
dominates um the scenery, it

00:15:58.724-->00:16:03.362
draws the eye especially if
you’ve got a moving picture on
it, um, that’s good and bad,

00:16:03.362-->00:16:07.900
that’s one of the reasons I felt
like I could get away without
adding new hardware last year

00:16:07.900-->00:16:14.140
was I had a really good platform
to put new stuff on and I added
new songs. So, in that mega

00:16:14.140-->00:16:19.145
tree, those are just strings of
those bullet pixels inside a
small plastic strip, um that has

00:16:21.814-->00:16:28.020
holes pre drilled in it and I
push the, push the pixels
through d-link at the top, and

00:16:28.020-->00:16:33.492
uh there’s companies that will
make headers up top or if you’re
uh if you’re handy, um there’s a

00:16:33.492-->00:16:39.999
number of good plans on top to
essentially put hooks that you
can hang stuff on, they run down

00:16:39.999-->00:16:45.037
the 14 feet and I’ve got 10
stakes in the ground um that
hold them in the ground, and if

00:16:45.037-->00:16:50.810
you look at the tree you can see
through um as those are all lit,
so there’s gaps, there’s several

00:16:50.810-->00:16:56.148
inches of gaps but as you’re at
the street level and look at it
um it does a great job being a

00:16:56.148-->00:17:00.586
small display um for whatever
you want to put on it; whether
its colors, patterns or other

00:17:00.586-->00:17:06.859
things. Um and there, there,
there an impressive addition um
to any display because of the

00:17:06.859-->00:17:12.365
amount of things you can add to
them. I talked about the
floodlights, um the difference

00:17:12.365-->00:17:18.938
um that it make on my- made on
my house, if you look at the far
left picture, um very dark and

00:17:18.938-->00:17:24.744
and uh and you know sparse
between the elements, when you
start to add the colors in

00:17:24.744-->00:17:29.749
between, um it just changes the
whole look of the house. Um, so
I’ll switch from here from the

00:17:32.051-->00:17:37.056
concepts of what we built to how
you make it run. So, the pixels
themselves um you want to be

00:17:41.027-->00:17:47.233
able to control from a computer
so there’s a prope- protocol uh
that runs over ethernet, it’s

00:17:47.233-->00:17:54.106
streaming ACN, it’s a standard
protocol for uh the control of
lights over ethernet and we’re

00:17:54.106-->00:18:00.146
not in a normal venue but if you
think about stage lighting and
all of those the, the lights you

00:18:00.146-->00:18:06.686
would, you would see in any sort
of concert, or disco venue, um
this was developed for that area

00:18:06.686-->00:18:12.458
and it was a lot of those are
controlled with colored lights
and it can stream out um values.

00:18:12.458-->00:18:17.463
Um, you can push it out, Unicast
to a single IP address or
Multicast where it broadcasts

00:18:20.066-->00:18:25.571
the packets throughout the whole
network, and it-it because of
the legacy, infrastructure is

00:18:25.571-->00:18:31.377
broken up into smaller chunks of
data. You don’t have to
understand this protocol, you

00:18:31.377-->00:18:36.549
don’t have to program to it
because people have crowdsourced
and open sourced all of this

00:18:36.549-->00:18:42.355
technology, and there’s um,
there’s amazing projects um
supported by the community

00:18:42.355-->00:18:46.726
that-that will deal with that,
but the concept of you’ve got to
get out of something in ethernet

00:18:46.726-->00:18:51.797
and it’s going to talk in a
known protocol to a controller.
So the controllers, this is

00:18:51.797-->00:18:57.003
what’s inside that gray box. Um,
it’s an ethernet to uh pixel
controller, this is one of the

00:18:57.003-->00:19:01.941
favorites in the industry, this
is about um 200 dollars, um but
if you look at the green, um,

00:19:05.277-->00:19:10.282
the green connectors along the
bottom, there’s uh, there’s 16
connectors for um, for various

00:19:12.518-->00:19:17.523
strings you can have um, you can
have hundreds of LEDs per
connector, um and there’s even a

00:19:19.625-->00:19:24.397
daughter board that will double
the connectors uh and double the
light outputs. So, it will take

00:19:24.397-->00:19:30.336
the ethernet in and then convert
it to the protocol that the uh,
the strings need. Um, the best

00:19:30.336-->00:19:34.607
controllers have web based
interfaces and I didn’t have my
display up while I was testing

00:19:34.607-->00:19:41.047
and controlling these, but I was
just controlling over um over a
web browser the set up and uh

00:19:41.047-->00:19:47.820
and configuration of those
lights. So, it lets you test, it
lets you remap um it lets you as

00:19:47.820-->00:19:52.825
you add things to the display um
put those in there. Um, along
the bottom the-the gold yellow

00:19:54.827-->00:19:59.832
things are um auto fuses, so
each of the pixel strings is
fused they’re dc elements

00:20:02.134-->00:20:08.040
usually running 5 volts or 12
volts and uh, uh sometimes bad
things happen with water and

00:20:08.040-->00:20:13.512
power. Um so having fuses there
I’ve seen cases where people
have shorted, gotten to the

00:20:13.512-->00:20:19.118
point um where they’ve melted
elements um or even started
small fires when they haven’t

00:20:19.118-->00:20:24.123
had fusing and this uh, the best
projects have fusing within them
as well. And then one thing that

00:20:26.892-->00:20:31.564
has to happen is you’ve got to
drive all of these pixels. So,
in my display every 50

00:20:31.564-->00:20:37.570
milliseconds every single pixel
and there’s tens of thousands of
pixels are getting a new um set

00:20:37.570-->00:20:42.575
of data um running out to the
lights. Um, this is an automated
set of software, that for me

00:20:44.577-->00:20:50.950
starts the lights up every day
at about five fifteen um it
sequences through about 15

00:20:50.950-->00:20:56.388
different songs and then loops
back around and it does that all
the way until 10 at night. So it

00:20:56.388-->00:21:00.693
puts them on a schedule it
streams the-the data to the
controllers. You can have a

00:21:00.693-->00:21:07.099
dedicated PC, or there’s an
element called a uh the falcon
pi player, which uses uh

00:21:07.099-->00:21:13.939
raspberry pi, um you precompile
all the data that’s gonna go out
and this thing just shoves data

00:21:13.939-->00:21:19.812
out the ethernet port, um very
cheaply, very reliably, and
control of like I said all of

00:21:19.812-->00:21:24.817
those various pr- um parts and
pieces. My show is um sequenced
and aligned to music, there’s

00:21:30.189-->00:21:36.529
millisecond control of the
lights and it has to get the
data across all of those uh

00:21:36.529-->00:21:41.400
elements. One thing that is
nice, and I’ll give a demo here
in a few minutes, is you’re able

00:21:41.400-->00:21:47.239
to uh simulate the show without
the hardware there. We can run
these pieces of technology and

00:21:47.239-->00:21:51.043
you can do development on your
desktop workshop, you don’t have
to have that seizure star

00:21:51.043-->00:21:56.348
sitting in the basement blinding
you while your uh, while you’re
doing your work, um but seeing

00:21:56.348-->00:22:01.287
it on the display is always a
little bit different than the um
simulation and uh one of the

00:22:03.355-->00:22:09.562
really cool things is because of
the kind of the colessing kind
of around the software, is

00:22:09.562-->00:22:14.567
sequences can be shared and
adapted, and I will show you an
example of that um uh in a

00:22:17.303-->00:22:22.308
minute as well as um you saw the
opening peanut sequence, um
that’s one I did last year and I

00:22:24.443-->00:22:30.649
crowd- I open sourced that,
posted it to the um Christmas
light forums and now there were

00:22:30.649-->00:22:36.355
50 or 100 different houses
around the world running my song
on their house. Now, they might

00:22:36.355-->00:22:42.995
not have had the same display
elements, but this software lets
them adapt in um move things

00:22:42.995-->00:22:48.000
into and out of the displays um
with pretty good ease. So right
here is the uh the software and

00:22:54.974-->00:22:59.979
I”ve got this incase my demo
fails and here’s where I’m going
to switch over and tempt the

00:23:08.354-->00:23:13.359
demo gods a little bit. Sorry.
Alright, so if you look on the
left side, there’s a display of

00:23:21.900-->00:23:26.905
my house, and along here is a
timeline with an audio wave file
and down below are all the

00:23:29.508-->00:23:35.648
various elements. So, this line
I just highlighted are the
floodlights from my house.

00:23:35.648-->00:23:42.221
Coming up in a few seconds, it
will be running the floodlights
directly, there’s the

00:23:42.221-->00:23:48.794
floodlights running, if you
notice they came on before that
where there’s a blank space,

00:23:48.794-->00:23:53.799
that’s because I have an element
that is everything in the house
and I’m doing something there.

00:23:56.235-->00:24:01.173
But what this graphic interface
lets you do is pick a type of uh
uh a type of display element, so

00:24:05.778-->00:24:10.783
I can take fire and I can put it
on my whole house, sorry I’ve
got other display elements

00:24:19.024-->00:24:24.029
running there. Ah I’m gonna flip
over to the other live demo. I
just told it to recompile that

00:24:32.838-->00:24:37.843
whole display. That’s what’s
running down here. So if I take
the whole house, so it will

00:24:59.598-->00:25:04.536
adapt, I’m not going to be able
to do it on this one, apologies.
Let me flip over I’ll go to the

00:25:20.853-->00:25:25.858
live demo with my lights [music
plays]. Alright, so the other
thing it can do it can control

00:25:57.923-->00:26:02.861
the lights live and where I am
now is running through where I
have it sequenced pushing up and

00:26:10.536-->00:26:15.541
down the strings, and I’ve got
text going on to the screen
[music continues] but the

00:26:19.378-->00:26:24.383
graphic interface lets me pull
an effect, like all the
sequence, on all the strings and

00:26:38.597-->00:26:43.602
run them red. I am getting no
love from my demos. Alright so
there’s a butterfly, rainbow

00:27:05.457-->00:27:10.629
effect I drag down and I can
tell it for how many
milliseconds across the time I

00:27:10.629-->00:27:16.435
want to drop that on, I can do
that across a single string, I
can do it across multiple

00:27:16.435-->00:27:23.141
strings, um, or various elements
of the display. So it’s a
graphic user interface, newbies

00:27:23.141-->00:27:28.146
can grab it despite the problems
I had up here um doing it live
in front of you, it’s an easy

00:27:31.483-->00:27:36.488
way to go try the elements, see
what they look like on the- on
your um your, your um, notial

00:27:39.224-->00:27:44.229
architecture of your house and
then do development all year
long as you’re ready to get

00:27:46.565-->00:27:51.570
these things together. I’ll flip
back over and hop out of the
demo space. So the other thing

00:28:14.326-->00:28:20.666
you can use besides the big
controllers I talked about are
raspberry pis, um the GPIO pins

00:28:20.666-->00:28:25.971
on the Raspberry Pis can drive
these lights directly and
independently themselves. Um you

00:28:25.971-->00:28:31.743
can’t get the same quantities
that you do with the hard um
with the large controllers, um

00:28:31.743-->00:28:36.214
but they’re a cheap way to get
started you can make small
elements for your house um and

00:28:36.214-->00:28:41.987
as you’re building something new
up um you can add them,
prototype them, and then put

00:28:41.987-->00:28:48.293
them in the larger display
ladder-later. There are daughter
cards for Raspberry Pis that are

00:28:48.293-->00:28:53.098
easier than going directly on
the pins, and what they do is
buffer the data going out so you

00:28:53.098-->00:28:58.103
can drive 12 volt, 5 volt
pixels, um one daughter card
will drive up to 800 pixels, um

00:29:00.439-->00:29:06.044
they will have, there’s options
for real time clocks in there to
keep them synchronized um there

00:29:06.044-->00:29:11.650
an easy way to get uh get
dabbling into the hobby. Where
do the pixels come from? I

00:29:11.650-->00:29:17.723
bought my pixels directly from
China. There’s ways to do these
in pre sales where um people

00:29:17.723-->00:29:23.462
band together um we’re a little
late in the season for pre sales
but January, February, March,

00:29:23.462-->00:29:28.867
people will buy together, get a
whole container shipped over
from China, one person will

00:29:28.867-->00:29:34.272
divvy it out and then send them
to you um saving you money.
There are places on ebay and

00:29:34.272-->00:29:39.011
Amazon that sell them, I would
recommend against them, I would
recommend you go to a specialty

00:29:39.011-->00:29:44.416
seller that serves the uh
Christmas light hobbyist and at
the end I’ve got a link for uh

00:29:44.416-->00:29:49.421
where you can find um the the
folks who do this with um, with
Facebook groups, um some, some

00:29:53.992-->00:29:58.997
internet boards, um and places
for mailing lists. They will
help you immensely with what’s a

00:30:02.167-->00:30:06.805
good price, what’s a good place
to buy and who’s reputable.
There’s two different form

00:30:06.805-->00:30:12.611
factors and voltages for these,
there’s 5 volt pixels and 12
volt pixels. People debate back

00:30:12.611-->00:30:17.416
and forth which are easier and
which are better, the good thing
about 5 volts, they’re a little

00:30:17.416-->00:30:22.421
cheaper um and uh the 12 volts
lets you run a longer string
without the um the degradation

00:30:26.525-->00:30:32.431
from long lengths. If you start
to run these and you go to far
out, the most power efficient

00:30:32.431-->00:30:37.302
LED is the red one, and it will
start to turn pink in your
colors if you’re trying to do

00:30:37.302-->00:30:43.575
white because the green and blue
will be starved for power and
the red will dominate, over

00:30:43.575-->00:30:48.580
dominate a lot of people use uh
12 volt pixels in their display.
The other thing we have is uh a

00:30:50.615-->00:30:55.620
matrix display, these are panels
developed for Vegas and other
places where you see the massive

00:30:58.223-->00:31:03.161
LED signs, um so these are 5-7
dollars a piece, and they stack
together. I’ve got 4 of them up

00:31:05.831-->00:31:10.836
there, um in a display node.
What they will let you do is
adept text, I use in my display

00:31:13.605-->00:31:18.610
um one of these to run graphics
and words and um tell people
what channel my FM radio is on

00:31:21.613-->00:31:26.618
so they can tune their radio.
And um, behind each of those is
running some sort of computer um

00:31:30.722-->00:31:36.661
to control and get the pixels
out to it there's a beaglebone
unix raspberry pi like device

00:31:36.661-->00:31:43.235
that you can run up to 64 of
those panels um and uh raspberry
pi will be able to control a

00:31:43.235-->00:31:48.240
dozen of them. The-the one you
see up there is um is 4 tall by
3 wide um so tens of thousands

00:31:51.943-->00:31:56.748
of pixels but it lets me do a
lot of interesting things in the
display. I talked earlier about

00:31:56.748-->00:31:58.750
the water issue, um you have to
buy weather rated lights, there
are some that come without

00:31:58.750-->00:32:00.685
protective coatings, um those
will be cheaper but those also
wont work, the first time you

00:32:00.685-->00:32:02.687
hit rain, you’re done. Um, a lot
of silicone caulk is used if you
have the strips which are

00:32:02.687-->00:32:04.723
plasticized tubes to seal the
end and I talked earlier about
the ways you can enclose your

00:32:04.723-->00:32:09.728
electronics. The thing you’ve
got to be careful about in
certain parts of the country is

00:32:16.034-->00:32:21.039
how to cool it. If you make
something watertight, it maybe
um it maybe generating too much

00:32:28.046-->00:32:33.051
heat inside that watertight
place, um so thinking about
cooling and other topics are

00:32:37.923-->00:32:42.928
good. I talked a little bit
about the challenges you run
into one is the voltage drop,

00:32:49.901-->00:32:56.174
you can’t push enough current
through to supply all those
lights um and they’ll turn pink.

00:32:56.174-->00:33:02.914
But you can at various layers
along the display inject new
voltage and just pull that both

00:33:02.914-->00:33:08.620
up power in both ends of the
strip or even in the middle um
it helps. The other challenge

00:33:08.620-->00:33:13.625
you’ll run into is distance to
the first pixel, so these are um
these are digital signals um but

00:33:15.994-->00:33:21.333
often run on crummy wires and so
if you’re trying to drive
something 100 feet before the

00:33:21.333-->00:33:26.638
first pixel you’re talking to,
the noise grows and you’ll get
corrupted data. What people have

00:33:26.638-->00:33:32.377
done is, you can put what’s
known as a null pixel in the uh,
in the string along the way and

00:33:32.377-->00:33:38.049
it will regenerate the signal,
so one thing the pixels do,
everytime they get data in they

00:33:38.049-->00:33:43.688
regenerate the waves going back
out and they fix up the signal
so a pixel along the way that

00:33:43.688-->00:33:48.693
doesn’t actually turn on um will
uh will allow the-the data to
continue. This is my FM radio

00:33:51.863-->00:33:56.868
station, it’s about 3 inches
square, I bought one from um New
Zealand as a kit, the kit

00:34:00.672-->00:34:07.045
consists of hooking the power
connector onto it, because it
might put out a little more

00:34:07.045-->00:34:13.451
power than the FCC will allow
them to sell directly um but I
will assure you here at blackhat

00:34:13.451-->00:34:17.622
since this is being taped that I
am well within the FCC
regulations [laughter] and not

00:34:17.622-->00:34:24.496
over transmitting. Um, so one of
the things you’ve got to do,
you’ve got to pick an open

00:34:24.496-->00:34:29.467
channel. Um, if you try to
broadcast over the local radio
station, they’re likely going to

00:34:29.467-->00:34:35.640
dominate you, and if not, you
dominate them is going to bring
the FCC in to look at you. Um,

00:34:35.640-->00:34:40.679
there is uh, there’s a great
database that will show you
where the licensed stations are

00:34:40.679-->00:34:47.252
in your area and the link is up
there um but just finding,
tuning through, um finding open

00:34:47.252-->00:34:49.254
channels uh is the easiest way
and uh what the folks um you
know skilled in the rf work will

00:34:49.254-->00:34:51.256
tell you the antenna makes a
really big difference um when I
wound up cutting an antenna from

00:34:51.256-->00:34:53.258
my frequency um I got so much
clearer signal um you know
you're trying to drive it out

00:34:53.258-->00:34:55.260
not uh not miles but uh but
hundreds of feet but you want a
nice clear signal and uh what

00:34:55.260-->00:34:57.262
I’ve found is um tuning your
antenna makes a huge difference.
So basic skills, soldering,

00:34:57.262-->00:35:03.868
debugging, planning, logical
thinking um every year um I
spend about 3 days putting my

00:35:03.868-->00:35:08.873
display up. Um I start and try
having it ready to turn on about
Thanksgiving night and uh the

00:35:22.687-->00:35:27.692
last 10 percent is where I spend
most of my time just worrying
about the the the little

00:35:35.800-->00:35:40.805
gremlins that pop up in any
large um kind of gerrymandered
um um display um so, so

00:35:43.341-->00:35:48.346
attention to detail figuring out
how to connect and display um
will be good. So, I’m getting

00:35:53.284-->00:35:58.890
ready for next year, um the
thing I’m going to be working on
and you’ll see the animated

00:35:58.890-->00:36:03.828
graphics right there, is a
chipmunk sequence I talked to
you about the fact that people

00:36:06.464-->00:36:11.469
like people crowdsource and open
source stuff I found an awesome
place fiver dot com um you can

00:36:14.806-->00:36:20.011
subcontract gig graphics out and
I work with people all over the
world to help me with

00:36:20.011-->00:36:26.384
these-these animations and then
uh build them together and put
them together in terms of song,

00:36:26.384-->00:36:31.656
so I’ll work on this next couple
of months and uh come October,
November, I’ll push that out

00:36:31.656-->00:36:38.163
there for the community to use
and, and and uh play with. The
other thing I’m working on is an

00:36:38.163-->00:36:43.768
element for the display, this is
currently sitting in my basement
that’s a large spray if you

00:36:43.768-->00:36:48.773
look, the center piece is 7
feet, 6 feet, 5 feet, 4 feet and
what this will let me do is

00:36:55.513-->00:37:00.452
other custom display elements
that work a little differently
than uh than the stuff I have so

00:37:03.488-->00:37:08.493
this will be a nice addition but
yet if, because I can treat it
like um 7 parallel matrix lines

00:37:13.665-->00:37:19.370
it’ll be really easy to do
things up to and probably
including text effects on it.

00:37:19.370-->00:37:24.375
Alright, so, how does this all
come together? I said building
absurd Christmas light songs, so

00:37:31.049-->00:37:36.688
I’ve pushed out the Charlie
Brown, I’m going to push out the
the Chipmunks this year, um one

00:37:36.688-->00:37:41.693
of the things somebody inspired
me to to share um what he’d done
was he’d built a Star Wars

00:37:44.095-->00:37:48.800
sequence, so this isn’t the
whole thing, but it’ll give you
a sense of how you can really no

00:37:48.800-->00:37:55.774
kidding get absurd with these
Christmas lights. [Darth Vader
breathing and lightsaber noises]

00:37:55.774-->00:38:00.712
It’s one of the most popular
display uh songs in my in my
show, Star Wars has been running

00:38:07.519-->00:38:12.524
a new movie over the holidays
almost every year so it still
stays fairly relevant and fresh.

00:38:18.463-->00:38:23.468
Again, going with that subtle
and understated, see the Star
Wars characters over the garage,

00:38:28.106-->00:38:33.111
those were my addition but there
are really like two or three
hundred houses around the world

00:38:39.050-->00:38:44.055
run this sequence every year.
People do displays not only for
Christmas, um there’s a lot of

00:38:49.994-->00:38:54.999
folks who put theres up at
Halloween, um do Halloween
displays, leave it up through

00:38:59.637-->00:39:04.576
the holidays and then change it
slightly for Christmas. I don’t
have the authority to run

00:39:07.245-->00:39:12.250
Halloween [applause]. Alright so
out on twitter, my twitter
RGB_Lights um I tweeted out this

00:39:21.626-->00:39:27.031
link as well, so if you don’t
catch it here you can go ahead
and get the link online but this

00:39:27.031-->00:39:32.837
has a 3 page pdf with places to
buy lights, the equipment I
recommend, um the online

00:39:32.837-->00:39:38.009
resources you can get together
and and uh build your own absurd
Christmas light show. So, thank

00:39:38.009-->00:39:41.579
you for your time. I’m going to
go to the chill out room if
anybody has detailed questions,

00:39:41.579-->00:39:46.584
I’m happy to talk lights.
Thanks. [applause]
