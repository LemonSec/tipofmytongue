00:00:00.000-->00:00:02.002
>>Okay! Lot’s to talk about, so
we’re not gonna, we’re just
gonna cut to the chase. Sigh

00:00:02.002-->00:00:04.004
Agent X, the stuff’s in the
program. So let’s get on with
it. Surveillance. Why are we

00:00:04.004-->00:00:06.006
doing surveillance in this talk?
1983 if you said to someone
surveillance this is what they

00:00:06.006-->00:00:08.008
would think about They wouldn’t
think about the, the global,
technical surveillance that’s

00:00:08.008-->00:00:13.013
going on at the moment.
>>Facebook >>So! Are you a
target? >> It’s entirely

00:00:31.999-->00:00:36.603
possible that you are. Some
people that may be in this room
have been targeted. And these,

00:00:36.603-->00:00:43.243
all these people have been- have
spoken at DefCon, or run DefCon,
uh, and where’s the pointer?

00:00:43.243-->00:00:47.948
There ya go. So the guy all the
way on the right is actually Zac
Franken who was speaking- who

00:00:47.948-->00:00:52.953
ran DefCon for 15 years and you
know DefCon might also be
targeting you! This is Michelle

00:00:56.390-->00:01:02.362
Madigan- you were there- this is
basically a sting reporter who
tried to stung DefCon, so we

00:01:02.362-->00:01:08.769
stung them with our own
undercover team. [laughter]
Yeah. So, yeah- real physical

00:01:08.769-->00:01:13.774
surveillance, really good times.
>>In a hostile environment.
>>yeah >>However, if your office

00:01:15.809-->00:01:20.914
at home looks like this and you
never leave your house, then
you’re probably not a target.

00:01:20.914-->00:01:25.586
Although it does look a bit like
Major Malfunction’s office.
>>But this is way neater >>yeah

00:01:25.586-->00:01:32.392
way >>I mean, like, cleaner
>>So, who’s likely to be
conducting surveillance? We’ve

00:01:32.392-->00:01:37.397
got the obvious three letter
agencies. The NSA, FBI, CIA, KFC
[laughter] okay maybe not KFC,

00:01:45.672-->00:01:50.677
unless you’re trying to sell the
secret recipe to north korea,
but y’know, a lot of companies

00:01:53.080-->00:01:59.219
have the ability to engage
surveillance teams if they
require them. A lot of

00:01:59.219-->00:02:04.257
government departments,
especially in the UK you know
local government can hire and

00:02:04.257-->00:02:09.029
bring in surveillance teams and
majesty's revenue and customs
are looking for fraud they have

00:02:09.029-->00:02:14.034
dedicated surveillance teams and
also you as an individual can go
and get trained so this is uh a

00:02:16.803-->00:02:21.808
UK company run by an ex military
surveillance operator. So you
provide two forms of ID, pay

00:02:24.144-->00:02:28.415
your money, if you pass the
course you get to formal
qualification so you become

00:02:28.415-->00:02:32.919
formally qualified in advanced
surveillance techniques for only
two thousand three hundred

00:02:32.919-->00:02:37.357
pounds. >>So that’s like in
Brexit money, that’s like two
hundred bucks [laughter] >>Yeah,

00:02:37.357-->00:02:42.362
pretty much. So one important
fact we have to point out right
in the beginning of the talk is

00:02:44.931-->00:02:50.504
all surveillance operators and
all vehicles involved if in
surveillance have what is called

00:02:50.504-->00:02:55.308
a heat state, your heat state
starts at ten at the start of an
operation or the start of an

00:02:55.308-->00:03:01.548
operational day and everytime
you come into contact with the
target or expose to the target

00:03:01.548-->00:03:08.021
your heat state drops to the
point where for example if you
crash your car into their car

00:03:08.021-->00:03:14.127
you end up toast. [laughter]
okay? At the end of the day all
of the operators will actually

00:03:14.127-->00:03:19.499
say what they think their heat
state is, so your mission as a
person that may be under

00:03:19.499-->00:03:24.504
surveillance is to rate or just
get their heat state to drop or
make toast. Now surveillance

00:03:28.041-->00:03:34.014
itself, three main stages to
surveillance, the pickup, the
follow, and the housing. The

00:03:34.014-->00:03:37.951
majority of the talk is going to
be about the follow because
that’s where most of the fun

00:03:37.951-->00:03:43.090
happens, but we will talk
quickly about the pickup ‘cause
this is important is getting

00:03:43.090-->00:03:48.462
control of a target at the
beginning of an operation or at
the beginning of the operational

00:03:48.462-->00:03:53.467
day um and they need to give a
description of the target where
they are and where they are

00:03:56.470-->00:04:02.175
going and this can be done in a
number of ways, we could use
static observation post this

00:04:02.175-->00:04:08.849
could be a neighboring property
for example. >>Yeah so this is
uh the big white building that’s

00:04:08.849-->00:04:14.554
the uh russian embassy in
Washington and uh the building
across the street that’s uh the

00:04:14.554-->00:04:19.526
FBI static surveillance post
that they’ve owned and operated
for years [laughter] and it’s

00:04:19.526-->00:04:23.763
very obviously a static
observation post like people are
like oh what’s with the giant

00:04:23.763-->00:04:27.534
cameras and the skylights?
[laughter] And no one goes
through the front door they

00:04:27.534-->00:04:33.406
always go through the backdoor
on the adjacent street. >>They
can also use static covert

00:04:33.406-->00:04:38.645
cameras um again with modern
technology they can fit a
camera, monitor it remotely, uh

00:04:38.645-->00:04:45.118
and pick up a source as they
leave. Or they can use a mobile
observation post, now I will

00:04:45.118-->00:04:51.324
cover this briefly, this is an
ex FBI 1989 Dodge surveillance
vehicle, that some guy >>F****d

00:04:51.324-->00:04:56.329
up [laughter] >>Yeah bought at
an action and then videoed it up
and put it on Youtube now on the

00:04:58.398-->00:05:03.336
top there that houses the
antennae, each of the lights
were fitted with microphones

00:05:05.639-->00:05:11.711
front and back, all of the roof
mounts were fitted with cameras
and inside we had a full suite

00:05:11.711-->00:05:17.384
of video and audio recording a
toilet and air con, obviously
we’ve got to keep him happy

00:05:17.384-->00:05:22.455
>>That’s a pretty nice van >>So.
Yeah pretty nice van. Obviously
not as nice as this van >>No

00:05:22.455-->00:05:28.895
[laughter] >>So if you see this
parked in your street you’ve
really screwed up, yeah? >>Yeah

00:05:28.895-->00:05:33.200
>>Or they can use a surveillance
vehicle now one point of a
surveillance vehicle is a is a

00:05:33.200-->00:05:38.872
lesser known technique uh and
that’s what’s known as a boot
fit or a trunk fit for you

00:05:38.872-->00:05:43.877
Americans out there uh this is a
especially adapted vehicle where
uh the operator is in the trunk

00:05:47.447-->00:05:54.454
of the vehicle, not comfortable,
however they have the ability to
observe, to video, to take

00:05:54.454-->00:05:59.793
pictures, and it is very
effective in certain
circumstances because a big a**

00:05:59.793-->00:06:04.731
van parked in this street would
be obvious whereas this could be
boot bit so very limited time

00:06:06.800-->00:06:13.373
because obviously this the
operator inside is at risk
however y’know it works. Now in

00:06:13.373-->00:06:19.846
the program we said these
techniques have been around for
years, they’ve changed little,

00:06:19.846-->00:06:26.286
this is a film maybe 1974 by the
Brits and shared with our
American friends under our

00:06:26.286-->00:06:31.291
special relationship >>So
special >>So Special. Uh and
this covers the pickup.

00:06:33.393-->00:06:38.398
Sequences have been shortened
[video music starts to play] as
they say in other words [music

00:06:42.535-->00:06:47.841
and indiscernible audio] >>I
love this music >>[audio from
video] The escort has remained

00:06:47.841-->00:06:52.846
stationary. The target passes
the second car who in turn sends
the information that will enable

00:06:54.881-->00:07:00.820
the third car to take up the
chase. >>From ground now moving
West >>Let’s look at that

00:07:00.820-->00:07:05.825
sequence again as seen through
the targets mirror he pulls away
and moves off down the road

00:07:10.997-->00:07:16.002
nothing to arouse his suspicions
and at approximately one
kilometer away from home the

00:07:19.339-->00:07:25.545
green Magnum pulling out to take
control of the follow appears as
part of the normal traffic

00:07:25.545-->00:07:31.685
pattern. Although he has seen
nothing the target has been
under surveillance most of the

00:07:31.685-->00:07:36.323
time [video ends]. >>And a key
point there is under
surveillance they are not

00:07:36.323-->00:07:41.328
following you they are not right
behind you oooh [laughter] thank
you. Um so within the follow

00:07:44.597-->00:07:49.602
especially in the vehicle follow
you can lose the vehicle it
doesn’t matter if you lose the

00:07:54.007-->00:07:58.945
vehicle especially if you’re on
a long operation it’s better to
lose the target than compromise

00:07:58.945-->00:08:03.049
the operation and make them
aware they’re under
surveillance. Now you heard them

00:08:03.049-->00:08:08.054
talking on the radio obviously
very old nowadays for brevity we
use brevity codes, this makes it

00:08:11.191-->00:08:17.897
easier for the team to
communicate it also hides things
like locations and directions of

00:08:17.897-->00:08:22.736
travel as you will see because
if they’re not using encrypted
communications you can intercept

00:08:22.736-->00:08:27.741
this and anyone listening might
be aware of what’s going on. So
here we see stand by that’s the

00:08:30.443-->00:08:36.583
target out of his house wearing
a red baseball cap, blue top,
grey trousers, and black shoes

00:08:36.583-->00:08:41.321
target getting into his car now
moving off turning left toward
the junction of High Street and

00:08:41.321-->00:08:46.426
Water lane. Now anyone listening
and picking up on radio knows
exactly where that person is and

00:08:46.426-->00:08:52.399
what direction they’re going so
we use brevity codes. Seven
seven alpha one from charlie

00:08:52.399-->00:08:58.605
one, blue on grey, black shoes,
red cap, complete bravo one,
mobile nine one yellow two.

00:08:58.605-->00:09:03.543
>>Sounds gobbledygook but the
team understands the last part
there is using what we call spot

00:09:07.647-->00:09:13.486
codes which are on spot maps and
again for ease of reference for
the team to be able to give the

00:09:13.486-->00:09:18.758
location of a target and a
direction of travel rather than
saying that they’re on this road

00:09:18.758-->00:09:23.763
travelling to towards the
village of Earl Shilton, as you
can see here, we can simply say,

00:09:26.766-->00:09:31.771
at red six intending right
committed nine one red five.
Everyone understands where the

00:09:35.075-->00:09:40.346
target is and what direction
they’re heading. >>So this kinda
gets to something we’ve spot

00:09:40.346-->00:09:46.352
maps made up for the entire
operational area, every body
every car of how many cars?

00:09:46.352-->00:09:52.192
Potentially 8 vehicles and 16
operators.So you’re looking at
binders of full of information

00:09:52.192-->00:09:57.864
rapidly put together with a big
team. It's just not a cheap
thing to do if you’re doing it

00:09:57.864-->00:10:03.269
right. It involves a lot of
teamwork and when you can make a
lot of toast you can help break

00:10:03.269-->00:10:09.809
that team up and thus ruin their
effectiveness. >> So what are we
looking for behind when we think

00:10:09.809-->00:10:14.180
were under surveillance?
Obviously they’ll be needing a
vehicle if you’re in texas and

00:10:14.180-->00:10:18.084
everybody’s driving pick-up
trucks, they will be driving
pickup trucks. If you’re in a

00:10:18.084-->00:10:24.557
city they will be in a sedan
car. They will blend in the
environment. They will not be

00:10:24.557-->00:10:29.562
driving big ass SUVs with
government plates. Except in DC.
>>Here is an extract in a local

00:10:35.802-->00:10:40.807
paper in Iowa and here we say
just in one state the large
number of licensed plates issued

00:10:43.710-->00:10:48.715
to cover to work this is because
and a professional team and
agents level team they will hold

00:10:51.017-->00:10:57.056
multiple licences which they can
change, and again if you raise
the heat state of that vehicle

00:10:57.056-->00:11:03.196
they think it needs changing
,they will change the license
plate. This can’t be done on the

00:11:03.196-->00:11:07.800
side of the road because someone
unscrewing the license plate and
screwing another one, someone's

00:11:07.800-->00:11:12.171
gonna call the cops and you
don't want to explain what
you’re doing. They will to do

00:11:12.171-->00:11:14.173
this and they will have to leave
the follow while it happens. Now
as we said they will not drive

00:11:14.173-->00:11:16.176
directly behind you. They will
use other vehicles as natural
covers, they will use 2 or 3

00:11:16.176-->00:11:18.177
cars behind you. They will use
parallel roots to get ahead of
you but in America you made it

00:11:18.177-->00:11:20.180
really easy you’ve come up with
the block system in most of the
cities so here we have

00:11:20.180-->00:11:22.181
outstanded FBI floating box. The
target vehicle is red, and the
direction of travel so the

00:11:22.181-->00:11:24.183
target vehicle turns the
messages relayed to all of the
team and the next opportunity

00:11:24.183-->00:11:29.188
all the vehicles turn the target
continues the other vehicles
come in behind and the target is

00:11:41.434-->00:11:46.439
still within the floating box.
So pulling up to a light and
just as it turn red driving

00:12:07.226-->00:12:13.499
through will not stop this.
Because there’s someone on
parallel route to pick you up.

00:12:13.499-->00:12:17.804
So how do we get around this,
how do we conduct anti
surveillance ? now quick point

00:12:17.804-->00:12:22.809
here. Anti surveillance is what
you do as an individual to
detect the surveillance team.

00:12:26.179-->00:12:33.019
Counter surveillance is when you
you use 3rd party to do that. Me
as a good guy I have my own good

00:12:33.019-->00:12:38.858
guy surveillance team to follow
me to see if they can identify
the bad guy surveillance thats

00:12:38.858-->00:12:43.129
counter surveillance. If you’re
doing anti surveillance you’re
on your own . >> and when you

00:12:43.129-->00:12:47.700
have 4th team, its counter
counter counter surveillance,
just to confuse things. Throw us

00:12:47.700-->00:12:52.705
all away down. >>So quite simply
you can do simple things like
vary your route, use the public

00:12:54.807-->00:13:01.481
transport and I don’t mean from
outside the house, drive
somewhere, park your car get in

00:13:01.481-->00:13:08.221
a bus. Get in a cab because
busses and cabs in most cities
around the world can go to

00:13:08.221-->00:13:14.027
places where normal vehicles
can’t so if you’re in a cab or
bus, they will not be able to

00:13:14.027-->00:13:18.998
follow you down the road, also
they will need to make
decisions, if you get in the

00:13:18.998-->00:13:23.703
bus, why are you on the bus, are
you meeting someone in that bus
or you’re doing something

00:13:23.703-->00:13:30.109
nefarious do they need to put
someone over there with you. At
that point you are in control,

00:13:30.109-->00:13:35.682
you can observe someone that
gets on, and make note of them,
you’ll be able to observe until

00:13:35.682-->00:13:42.088
the time >>So of course one of
the thing we’re doing here right
is switching up the tempo on the

00:13:42.088-->00:13:46.893
surveillance team, we’re putting
them them in the back, we’re
forcing them to make decisions

00:13:46.893-->00:13:51.064
quickly that is awkward. 50-50
decision and if you’re
lucky,they’ll make a 50-50

00:13:51.064-->00:13:56.669
decision will come up bad for
them and good for us. We’ll spot
them because they’re too close

00:13:56.669-->00:14:00.873
and or we’ll see them over and
over again. >>And obviously if
they do try to follow you down

00:14:00.873-->00:14:05.378
here. They’re allowed to be
stopped by this and again they
will again have to explain what

00:14:05.378-->00:14:11.751
the hell they were doing in the
bus lane. We can use natural
choke points. Here we have 2

00:14:11.751-->00:14:16.756
villages circled if you drive
around the road, around the lock
here it's about 47 miles, the

00:14:19.792-->00:14:26.699
roads are really crappy, and it
takes a long time however,
between the two is a ferry,

00:14:26.699-->00:14:32.839
again if you’re in a area where
these sorts of things like the
lakes area in the york with

00:14:32.839-->00:14:38.377
coferries use this to your
advantage if you get from here
again, the decisions comes are

00:14:38.377-->00:14:42.515
they gonna drive 47 miles to
trying to catch you on the other
side or they are going to put

00:14:42.515-->00:14:47.520
1,2,3 vehicles with you that
point again you’re in control
you can see and look at everyone

00:14:49.856-->00:14:56.429
on there. Another technique
which surveillance operators are
told to recognize before it

00:14:56.429-->00:15:01.501
happens is something called the
long look this is where you have
a long straight roads with no

00:15:01.501-->00:15:07.140
parallel road and when the time
the target hits this road they
have a long look behind them so

00:15:07.140-->00:15:12.044
they can see lots of vehicles if
they’re in a convoy, specially
if they’re not in a busy road.

00:15:12.044-->00:15:17.083
Again, a lot easier in the
states this I sat in the middle
of the road took picture one

00:15:17.083-->00:15:23.790
way. This was 8 mile long this
straight, there were no parallel
roads. I saw one of the car in 4

00:15:23.790-->00:15:29.028
hours so surveillance team
behind me one this road I hope i
recognize them. >> the other

00:15:29.028-->00:15:33.800
thing about that is that they’re
forcing the team to also do
resource management they’re

00:15:33.800-->00:15:38.037
gonna have to put one car down
that road because they can’t put
all of them down on that road

00:15:38.037-->00:15:42.141
after you because it sticks out
right. It breaks the pattern.
And that’s the thing we figured

00:15:42.141-->00:15:47.113
out how to choke them and break
the pattern we’re gonna spot
them >> we can also use

00:15:47.113-->00:15:53.519
technology in our advantage, if
you have someone to assist you.
What we can do is, have them to

00:15:53.519-->00:15:58.524
choke points say the morning and
they video every car that comes
through before and after you

00:16:00.860-->00:16:05.865
forbid if 10 mins, the later
during the day it's another
geographic location, again do

00:16:08.234-->00:16:14.340
the same then you get to list of
license plates, compare the
licenses ends up on both list

00:16:14.340-->00:16:19.345
potentially that’s surveillance
vehicle. Technology can help us
so the OpenALPR program

00:16:22.348-->00:16:27.353
automated license plate reader
so this is a bit of footage I
took with an iphone in real

00:16:30.623-->00:16:35.394
time, there is the image in the
bottom right hand corner. That’s
me running the image file

00:16:35.394-->00:16:40.399
through the software. Now the
software reads the image file
frame by frame so you will have

00:16:43.069-->00:16:48.074
multiple instances of the same
license plate so again we can
use technology we can run the

00:16:50.076-->00:16:55.081
software extract the json
convert that to a sequel file
>>Thank god we recorded at the

00:17:02.154-->00:17:07.159
demo, and that is recorded. So
the other thing while this is
running there’s other tools that

00:17:14.200-->00:17:19.205
do this and amazon facial
recognition project. If you can
do it for car you can do it with

00:17:24.110-->00:17:30.850
faces. >> so out of the box
sequel, sqlite on coli, distance
support, regular expressions so

00:17:30.850-->00:17:37.189
we download and install pel
regret instructions module
reading the simple file running

00:17:37.189-->00:17:43.462
standard query using the rejects
here for standard UK license
plates which is letter, letter,

00:17:43.462-->00:17:48.534
number, number, letter, letter
and here you will see in the
first set of results you get

00:17:48.534-->00:17:53.472
some license plate that are
quite similar that’s due to the
mysteries in the software where

00:17:53.472-->00:17:59.211
the images are slightly blurred
and hardly recognize so to get
around this you can just do a

00:17:59.211-->00:18:04.216
standard sequel count whether
you got 2 similar license plate,
the one with the higher count

00:18:04.216-->00:18:11.123
will be the real number. So
we’ve now driven to where we’re
gonna meet our contact to pick

00:18:11.123-->00:18:16.128
up our data and we’re gonna park
and again, parking is a choke
point, you’re in control you

00:18:19.198-->00:18:24.503
choose where to park, they have
to decide if they have to park
on the same car park with you.

00:18:24.503-->00:18:29.508
Because you may spot them.
Specially if you’re going to a
multi story park again that is

00:18:29.508-->00:18:33.145
choke point where you can
observe. Now there’s a
misconception that comes from

00:18:33.145-->00:18:38.150
law enforcement and the military
, always park your car in
reverse for quick get away

00:18:40.586-->00:18:45.591
surveillance operators are
trained to blend in, the grey
man, so if everyone's knows you

00:18:48.361-->00:18:54.100
park because they are here and
you reverse park to someone
that’s surveillance aware,

00:18:54.100-->00:18:57.703
automatically your eyes are
drawn to that car automatically,
why is that car parked

00:18:57.703-->00:19:02.642
differently. Again we can see
here to someone that is more
observant than the rest of us

00:19:05.644-->00:19:10.649
there’s the one that’s parked
wrong and how about that one,
has anyone spot that car on the

00:19:13.419-->00:19:18.424
opposite direction? Its right in
the middle of the screen dude,
so yeah, again if you’re in a

00:19:20.493-->00:19:25.498
cab you can get the cab to stop
wherever you want, you can drop
me here, and if there's no

00:19:29.235-->00:19:34.974
parking what do they do? If it's
in a restricted parking area and
they abandoned their vehicle,

00:19:34.974-->00:19:41.113
they can lose their vehicle.
Explain that one to your boss,
and so were doing is that we’re

00:19:41.113-->00:19:46.252
in the tempo right you jump out
of the cab if the unexpected is
on the cross drive which we’ve

00:19:46.252-->00:19:51.257
all done i hope, this is vegas
and you basically force them to
go from a car tail to a foot

00:19:54.326-->00:20:00.700
tail and they don't necessary
have assets that close and that
quickly available, its gonna

00:20:00.700-->00:20:07.473
mess things up for them, it's
gonna make them bad decisions.
>> now when you return to your

00:20:07.473-->00:20:13.779
car again gives you a chance to
look in the cars as you walk
pass which said that they’re

00:20:13.779-->00:20:18.784
professionals but they’re also
humans and humans do mistakes
and so if you see maps in there

00:20:20.986-->00:20:25.991
you may see other paraphernalia
and this is true story told to
me by a friend 2 surveillance

00:20:28.961-->00:20:33.966
instructors were visiting
students on a covered
observation post course and they

00:20:37.236-->00:20:42.241
parked their vehicle and went on
foot. Someone reported the
vehicle is being suspicious so

00:20:45.578-->00:20:50.750
the police turned up. The police
looked in the vehicle and
sticking out from under the seat

00:20:50.750-->00:20:55.754
was a hampstead, and they waited
and so they came back and yes
explain to them what we're doing

00:21:00.226-->00:21:05.297
with our special car that says
please don't arrest us, we’re
doing surveillance training. >>

00:21:05.297-->00:21:11.604
We’re not calling them
criminals, we have a card at
school >>Honest >>One of the

00:21:11.604-->00:21:17.109
clarification questions when we
submitted that talk is why old
school vehicle surveillance, you

00:21:17.109-->00:21:22.114
can put a tracker on there, well
yeah you can but they are
technical adversary they can

00:21:24.717-->00:21:30.055
detect that and if they detect
that they will know they were in
surveillance also yes it's great

00:21:30.055-->00:21:35.794
he stopped at the mall and I’m a
mile away. So he’s out of his
car and in the mall you get

00:21:35.794-->00:21:40.799
there, where is he? The main
point of surveillance is to have
enough people in contact with

00:21:43.135-->00:21:48.607
the target so when he stops you
can deploy on default and
continue to follow. >>The point

00:21:48.607-->00:21:54.647
of surveillance is not to know
where the people go,but is to
observe their behavior. Were

00:21:54.647-->00:21:58.384
looking for is that if they’re
doing the deed that made them
interesting in the first place

00:21:58.384-->00:22:03.422
so technical surveillance,
metadata surveillance is great
you know Jimmy goes to Fry’s

00:22:03.422-->00:22:08.494
every Tuesday and buys a
hamburger but frankly that’s not
what we care about. We want to

00:22:08.494-->00:22:13.499
know who he share his emperor
with. >>So we’re out of the car,
we’re walking along they’re out

00:22:17.036-->00:22:22.041
on foot. What are these people
look like, F*cking bad*sses.
[laughter]. They always look

00:22:24.410-->00:22:29.415
like this media has told us that
they always are gigantic badass
white males with short hair and

00:22:32.585-->00:22:39.291
big watches, so if you see these
guys on the streets, you’ll
think oh my god I’m under

00:22:39.291-->00:22:44.296
surveillance, well they've got
earpieces that I can see this
guy has a wire from his radio

00:22:47.533-->00:22:53.572
sticking out as should, this
guys has push to talk button
sticking out the sleeve and this

00:22:53.572-->00:22:58.577
guy has a holster, so he’s
armed. If these guys are
following you, they’re doing

00:23:01.714-->00:23:06.552
overt surveillance, they want
you to know they’re there.
they’re not there to see what

00:23:06.552-->00:23:11.557
you’re doing they are there so
you can see them doing you. So
these 3 people where part of a

00:23:14.293-->00:23:19.298
UK tv show one is ex GHCQ one is
ex MI6 and one is a NEXMI5
surveillance operator. So who’s

00:23:30.909-->00:23:35.914
who? Not the grey man, the grey
person, they will use female
operators because we’re all

00:23:38.384-->00:23:44.790
fixated on short big tall white
man you wont pay second thought
to this person sat from the bus

00:23:44.790-->00:23:49.795
next to you. Also the newbies
into surveillance they fall into
the habit of the unofficial

00:23:53.565-->00:23:58.570
uniform that they all dress so
differently that all dress the
same wearing black shirts. >>

00:24:01.206-->00:24:06.445
that never happens, no one ever
wears black shirt and jeans all
the time, were talking about

00:24:06.445-->00:24:13.152
they have khaki shorts and black
shirts. That’s theirs summer
clothes. On their thought they

00:24:13.152-->00:24:18.524
still need to communicate, they
will have wireless earpiece you
will not see wires sticking out

00:24:18.524-->00:24:24.463
their ears. If you have big ears
like me you won't see anything.
You might if you look close

00:24:24.463-->00:24:30.035
enough see the retractor stem on
the earpiece you need to get
signals on the earpiece so

00:24:30.035-->00:24:35.040
there’s inductive loop around
the neck this also has a
microphone in it to transmit the

00:24:40.145-->00:24:45.617
data the antenna is normally
worn of the center of the back
across the shoulders in a

00:24:45.617-->00:24:52.524
t-shape to the best attenuation,
and the pressel talk switch
doesn’t hang down your sleeve it

00:24:52.524-->00:24:57.529
will be secluded somewhere
inside your clothing where it
can't be seen. The whole kit is

00:24:59.598-->00:25:06.372
worn in a vest with the radio on
one side and the battery on the
other side to reduce bulk. So

00:25:06.372-->00:25:11.043
this is quite a lot of equipment
they’re wearing and ofcourse
they have to wear clothing to

00:25:11.043-->00:25:16.048
conceal it now talking about
clothing they will utilize
changes in appearance. very old

00:25:21.720-->00:25:26.725
photographs and >>do love me a
good Stasi archive. This is
where I get all my fashion tips.

00:25:28.894-->00:25:35.534
>These were taken from manerock
archive from the stasi, which is
the east German secret police

00:25:35.534-->00:25:42.040
who has a huge surveillance
capability. Even nowadays an
agent surveillance team will

00:25:42.040-->00:25:47.045
utilize wigs playing glasses
false mustaches you think its a
joke, it works. >>It's all about

00:25:51.517-->00:25:56.522
breaking out the outline. From
the head up, these two guys are
totally different right.same

00:25:58.557-->00:26:03.829
shirt but outline are different.
And we are not that good with at
taping all the people around us.

00:26:03.829-->00:26:09.234
We make little outline about
people around us and that’s
about it. So you just have to

00:26:09.234-->00:26:14.973
break that outline and you can
disappear on the crowd pretty
easy >> now one of the problems

00:26:14.973-->00:26:19.878
of the surveillance operator
doing change for the appearance
is you have limited time to do

00:26:19.878-->00:26:24.883
this. People forget people
operators like goons. Are there
goons in here ? there's a couple

00:26:29.388-->00:26:34.393
of goons here. We spend days on
your feet so you’ve got a pair
of shoes you like and are

00:26:38.730-->00:26:44.570
comfortable they’re fabulous,
shut up. There's no place like
home. So they’ll change up

00:26:44.570-->00:26:48.407
everything else but their shoes
won’t change so remember we
said, you’re in a public

00:26:48.407-->00:26:53.412
transport, you’re being observed
this is what you’ll be looking
for the small details that

00:26:53.412-->00:26:58.417
people don't change how often do
you look at mens shoes >>
Watches, people like their

00:27:01.286-->00:27:06.291
specially ex military nice glow
in the dark watch things that
they forget to change the next

00:27:09.428-->00:27:14.433
time you see looks different but
with the same watch make note.
Jewelry again, wedding rings

00:27:22.040-->00:27:27.045
necklaces women with earings. So
they’re behind you so what they
do behind you they will be

00:27:35.754-->00:27:40.759
conducting most standard abc
pattern so you got the target in
red. Directly behind the target

00:27:45.697-->00:27:50.702
is the guy that is in control
only one person in control and
has the eyeball in the target.

00:27:53.405-->00:27:59.177
Behind him is the person that
his backing. He is in the
position to take control and in

00:27:59.177-->00:28:04.850
the opposite side of the road is
the trail is slightly behind the
target to observe from the

00:28:04.850-->00:28:11.456
distance. You can't do it this
with one or 2 people so if you
think I’m following that person,

00:28:11.456-->00:28:16.461
yeah, you’re following them into
a trap. So the target turns the
corner now has the target

00:28:22.668-->00:28:27.906
continue to walk as the target
stop to wait to see who follow
them on the corner, the trail

00:28:27.906-->00:28:33.212
being on the opposite side of
the road can see this, they can
pass the message that the target

00:28:33.212-->00:28:37.349
has continued to walk on the
road. So the guy control crosses
the road to trail and becomes

00:28:37.349-->00:28:43.855
the control, the guy in control
now becomes the trail. And the
guy behind is now backing. You

00:28:43.855-->00:28:48.860
still have maintained control of
the target. You are still
imposing surveillance and the

00:28:54.700-->00:28:59.705
other 15 guys, 14 guys in a
team, they again maybe on
parallel ruse, maybe further

00:29:01.840-->00:29:06.845
back and can swap and change so
that you can limit your exposure
to the target. Now from our

00:29:09.581-->00:29:14.686
perspective we want to conduct
anti surveillance against this
guys and girls so we use the

00:29:14.686-->00:29:19.691
surroundings for example if
we’re doing anti surveillance we
want to identify them without

00:29:24.663-->00:29:29.167
letting them know we’re
identifying them. Because that
gives away the game. You want to

00:29:29.167-->00:29:34.606
know they’re there so you can
either lose them to do what you
need to do or do what you need

00:29:34.606-->00:29:39.611
to do when they can’t see you.
We can use the environment in
subways the sort of mirrors you

00:29:41.947-->00:29:46.952
see in UK in the underground.
Walking along the street, window
shopping. Window shopping is a

00:29:49.254-->00:29:53.492
great thing because windows are
reflective. You’re not looking
for who’s on the same side of

00:29:53.492-->00:29:56.962
the road in, you’re looking
who’s on the opposite side of
the road. You’re looking for the

00:29:56.962-->00:30:03.502
trail because they may become
complacent not being directly
behind the target, not rotating

00:30:03.502-->00:30:08.006
as much, and if you keep seeing
the same person on the side of
the road. Potentially that’s

00:30:08.006-->00:30:14.880
someone that has you under
surveillance. >>So this is kinda
one that things you see. The CIA

00:30:14.880-->00:30:19.818
training people to do what they
call counter surveillance which
is actually anti surveillance

00:30:19.818-->00:30:24.122
routes one of the things they do
is that you really have to learn
that urban terrain you have to

00:30:24.122-->00:30:27.926
learn where those mirrors are,
you have to learn what windows
will work for you. What are the

00:30:27.926-->00:30:33.598
choke points are, so and so
forth. So they really do invest
in having a lot of case officers

00:30:33.598-->00:30:40.205
really really well. Know how to
really run their anti
surveillance routes. To the

00:30:40.205-->00:30:45.177
point where case officers where
like, I have been running anti
surveillance routes for 3 months

00:30:45.177-->00:30:50.182
now when do I get my job? >> You
are in control here, you choose
the environment, you choose the

00:30:52.751-->00:30:59.191
place. Again if you’re in a
mall, get on escalators, natural
for people to stand on

00:30:59.191-->00:31:04.329
escalators, turn around and look
around, look behind them and
talk to their friends gives you

00:31:04.329-->00:31:09.334
the opportunity to see who’s one
story below coming up. Now we
carry mobile phones so why would

00:31:12.904-->00:31:19.511
you want to use one of these?
User payphone it gives you a
reason to stop, it gives you a

00:31:19.511-->00:31:26.051
reason to look around you.
Surveillance operators are
trained, if the target stopped,

00:31:26.051-->00:31:31.723
they have to have a reason for
being there. So they don’t just
stop and turn they’re back and

00:31:31.723-->00:31:38.096
pretend they’re not there.
They’ll go into a shop, store or
walk into a phone pick it up and

00:31:38.096-->00:31:42.801
pretend that doing something
else. But you already used that,
they need to find somewhere

00:31:42.801-->00:31:47.472
else. >>This is called cover for
action by the way, it's
basically the reason you’re

00:31:47.472-->00:31:52.744
there. You all know the answer
to this one it's I’m here, I
have a switch and I’m here to

00:31:52.744-->00:31:59.584
put this stuff inside your
network. You have a cover for
action, it’s the reason you are

00:31:59.584-->00:32:05.957
in that environment, it is
natural and smooth. So break
that. >>So again we can use

00:32:05.957-->00:32:11.463
natural choke points while were
out walking, you know the area,
you know this is a one way

00:32:11.463-->00:32:16.268
street the only thing on the
bottom of this street is a
coffee shop no one goes to. So

00:32:16.268-->00:32:21.873
anyone else walking down the
street behind you is one you’re
interested in. You could have

00:32:21.873-->00:32:26.878
areas where there is only one
point to get from a to b that
they have to transit to, again

00:32:30.081-->00:32:35.921
they will have to take the long
way around or push everyone
through there which will give

00:32:35.921-->00:32:40.926
you the opportunity to observe.
Things that are less obvious.
Most guys don’t want to go in

00:32:42.961-->00:32:47.399
here, unless they are with their
wife or girlfriend. So if I go
in here and then another guy

00:32:47.399-->00:32:52.404
gets in, I’m interested, well
I’m interested in him [laughter]
>> Oh yeah, well played sir,

00:32:56.908-->00:33:02.747
well played. Indeed. >>but they
have women in their teams, they
can put woman in there and

00:33:02.747-->00:33:07.752
that’s not suspicious and yep,
but she’s not following men
here. Again,make them make

00:33:11.523-->00:33:16.528
decisions, why are you going in
here. It may be obvious, but it
may not be. In cold war times,

00:33:19.130-->00:33:24.135
this were the places where
packages are placed for people
to go in and retrieve and

00:33:27.239-->00:33:33.511
collect data, because people
don’t want to follow people in
the men’s room. So use it to

00:33:33.511-->00:33:39.217
your advantage. Again if someone
comes in there it just gives you
the opportunity to make note of

00:33:39.217-->00:33:44.222
what they’re wearing. Elevators,
first you will not get into the
elevators with these people.

00:33:47.492-->00:33:54.132
They’re so unhappy, they’re
gonna fight, they’re strange and
again they have to make that

00:33:54.132-->00:33:59.738
decision, do they put someone in
this small metal box with you.
Which point you’re this far

00:33:59.738-->00:34:06.278
away, or really get a good look
on them. Also if you get in the
elevator and no one get in

00:34:06.278-->00:34:12.684
behind you, press, 3 or 4 floors
and get off on your floor. And
no matter what you see on the

00:34:12.684-->00:34:18.189
films, they’re not gonna run up
15 storeys worth of stairs to
beat you into the top. It

00:34:18.189-->00:34:23.194
doesn’t happen. It also gives
you a chance to make toast.
Engage with them, if someone’s

00:34:25.830-->00:34:30.168
right there that’s a bit
suspicious, might be a
surveillance operator, you turn

00:34:30.168-->00:34:35.173
to them and this is the key
thing, in your best british
accent, you say, excuse me my

00:34:37.275-->00:34:43.214
good man, mind if I pity you for
a stop, could you tell me the
time please? But why british

00:34:43.214-->00:34:49.387
accent, but we have awesome
accent too. >>Have you ever
noticed how in hollywood movies

00:34:49.387-->00:34:54.392
all the villains are played by
Brits, maybe we just sound
right, more focused or precise,

00:35:01.399-->00:35:10.041
were always one step ahead. I’m
very obsessed by power, we all
drive Jaguars, Oh yes. It’s good

00:35:10.041-->00:35:24.956
to be bad. >>So we move on to
hostile environments, this isn't
afghanistan or downtown LA, we

00:35:24.956-->00:35:29.961
use hostile environment to our
advantage. This is agent x’s
favorite hostile environment.

00:35:33.431-->00:35:38.436
>>no one’s surveilling me, well
they are, but I’m wanting them
to. >> Remember they’re wearing

00:35:42.707-->00:35:48.446
all this kit, they have to wear
enough clothing to cover this
kit. They get in the pool with

00:35:48.446-->00:35:53.451
you. >>or the turkish spa by the
way is also really good >>We can
also use misdirection again

00:35:59.024-->00:36:03.762
they’ll looking for you to have
interactions with people,
they’re trying to identify who

00:36:03.762-->00:36:08.767
you’re meeting. Use this to your
advantage. If you meet someone
on the street, shake hands with

00:36:12.670-->00:36:17.676
them, or when I meet my friend
Trevor for milkshake, I normally
give him a big bro hug or, a

00:36:24.916-->00:36:29.921
fall on Jayson street awkward
hug or stand in front of someone
who’s a bigger target than you

00:36:32.223-->00:36:37.228
are. >>Yeah That’s a classic
trick, this worked for me for
years. >> Again, use the

00:36:40.165-->00:36:45.170
environment, going to a cafe you
control the environment, you can
choose where to sit, you can see

00:36:48.473-->00:36:53.478
everyone that comes in, make a
not of everyone that comes in,
when you read the paper, when to

00:36:57.916-->00:37:04.255
finish, take that paper, fold it
up and put it on the side and
leave. >>Put it in an awkward

00:37:04.255-->00:37:10.662
kind of special spot, between
the planters right >>so it
doesn’t entirely the way they

00:37:10.662-->00:37:15.667
now have a decision has that
paper got something in of
importance, do they leave the

00:37:17.969-->00:37:22.974
whole team watching that cafe to
see who come and picks up that
paper. >>So awkward, here’s a

00:37:26.845-->00:37:32.083
pro tip by the way, if you have
ever seen the Big Lebowski you
f*cking Jackie Treehorn them too

00:37:32.083-->00:37:38.957
so when they do find it, he he
he he. >>Or they split the team
in half, half watch the cafe,

00:37:38.957-->00:37:45.597
and half continue to follow you.
You have one at that point
because you have now have half

00:37:45.597-->00:37:52.337
the amount of people operating
against you while you going to
do you your sh*t. You can also

00:37:52.337-->00:37:57.342
use their techniques and
remember from the start of the
thing we gave description of

00:37:59.944-->00:38:06.117
what the target look like. So
the surveillance team has been
following you for 6 hours and

00:38:06.117-->00:38:11.122
all they’re looking for is a red
hat, you can use change of
appearance, while I’m not saying

00:38:13.358-->00:38:19.564
carrying wigs and mustaches and
sh*t with you, >>which will not
work if you’re not a pro, its

00:38:19.564-->00:38:24.569
really embarrassing if your face
falls off >>take a bag take your
coat off, take your hat off and

00:38:28.406-->00:38:33.411
then you’ve changed your
appearance. [laughter from the
audience] >>maybe not your

00:38:36.281-->00:38:42.854
political persuasion but it
should do it. Now you’re saying
this is old school which is

00:38:42.854-->00:38:47.892
where we are, this shi*t is not
happening anymore. >>This sh*t
happens in Tuesday everywhere.

00:38:47.892-->00:38:52.897
>>So here we have Richard and
Cynthia Murphy, So wholesome,
they have barbecues, they have

00:38:55.667-->00:39:00.772
some more children they have
lived in a small town. And
upstate New York, the neighbors

00:39:00.772-->00:39:05.777
thought they are lovely they
like hotdogs come on! They’re
actually Vladimir and Lidiya

00:39:09.414-->00:39:14.419
Gyryev, they were deep russian
operative that’s been in the
country since the late 80’s or

00:39:17.322-->00:39:20.892
late 90’s, their children were
born in the country, the
Russians were playing the long

00:39:20.892-->00:39:25.897
game. They came on the radar the
FBI they started an operation
against these people, and as a

00:39:32.837-->00:39:38.877
result they have identified a
total of 10 deep Russian
operatives. >>Look at how

00:39:38.877-->00:39:43.881
unhappy these people are
[laughter]. >>That’s because
they got caught and they were

00:39:45.917-->00:39:50.922
conducting surveillance for
these people for nearly 10 years
surveillance is a long game

00:39:54.392-->00:39:59.897
because you want them, you want
their handlers you want their
handlers bosses, you want

00:39:59.897-->00:40:06.104
everyone’s involved in that
team. >>You wanna know how
they’re operating right? Because

00:40:06.104-->00:40:11.809
everybody on surveillance games
playing from the same playbook.
The way that’s the Soviets

00:40:11.809-->00:40:16.814
sorry, the russians surveil or
the way we surveil is exactly
the same team make up, same

00:40:18.816-->00:40:24.555
stuff, because it's really like
a bicycle, it's got an optimal
form where just gonna run with

00:40:24.555-->00:40:29.560
it, there’s not a lot of change
ups that they run. >> Now an
interesting part of this

00:40:31.663-->00:40:36.668
operation was afterwards they
deported them all, the FBI have
release video footage of

00:40:39.370-->00:40:44.375
surveillance they’re taping now
we start with this one, this is
a very strange angle, its a

00:40:46.444-->00:40:52.583
covered camera in a tree
pointing directly down this is
someone picking up a package

00:40:52.583-->00:40:58.556
from a dead letter box, when you
pick from a dead letter box,
it's meant to be quick, not

00:40:58.556-->00:41:04.128
rooting around in the sharpery.
Digging sh*t with a shovel draws
attention now although they use

00:41:04.128-->00:41:10.835
technology here with a covered
camera, surveillance team that
got them to that point and had

00:41:10.835-->00:41:15.473
the identified where this was
happening for them to use
technology for their advantage.

00:41:15.473-->00:41:22.180
And again with the dead letter
box, don’t use the same one.
Because when you go back there

00:41:22.180-->00:41:27.185
will be camera, so , second one
again, this is totally normal.
We all do this, we all go for

00:41:29.687-->00:41:36.294
walks, and then we go and hide
under bridges and take something
out of there because that’s

00:41:36.294-->00:41:41.299
normal. >>Why don’t we put Billy
Gordon for the kids, >>its right
, yeah. In the next couple of

00:41:43.701-->00:41:48.706
videos, I want you to look how
sloppy they’ve got. We’ve all
seen these techniques. These are

00:41:50.742-->00:41:56.047
pros, literally their life is on
the line and they’ve been doing
this for 10 years. This is what

00:41:56.047-->00:42:00.985
pros look like. This is a brush
pass, this is meant to be 2
people carrying the same item in

00:42:05.156-->00:42:10.294
a busy crowded street [laughter
] because that’s normal right? I
mean I just do that all the

00:42:10.294-->00:42:14.732
time, I find a tunnel in New
York and say hey man, here’s my
groceries you got some

00:42:14.732-->00:42:20.772
groceries, that would be great.
Oh this guy, not a spy. >>they
need to go back to school,

00:42:20.772-->00:42:25.777
they’re not slick. And this guy
is even better, this is a subway
>>Just hanging out >>Not really

00:42:27.912-->00:42:32.917
acting suspicious, and no, he’s
not coming >>Because we all hang
out in the subways of New York

00:42:35.053-->00:42:39.390
right? Like you gotta take the
subway, you really don’t want to
be in the subway, anyway. You’re

00:42:39.390-->00:42:45.363
not gonna hangout there. >>the
FBI got bored didn’t they so
they cut the footage >> they

00:42:45.363-->00:42:50.334
edited the footage, how long the
guy was loitering in there but
then eventually they started the

00:42:50.334-->00:42:55.339
footage again and I’m here,
quickly adjust the clothing and
were off to do our brush pass,

00:42:57.742-->00:43:02.680
again slick in a busy, yeah no,
and again all these camera
angles are taken from covered

00:43:05.883-->00:43:10.888
cameras >> And remember, it's
the FBI, they’re inherently
bureaucracy right? so somebody

00:43:13.357-->00:43:19.096
have to fill out a paperwork,
like hey can we put up camera in
a public place and surveil? So

00:43:19.096-->00:43:25.336
they hire up a lawyer to get
involved and so on and so forth.
A lot of this stuff it took a

00:43:25.336-->00:43:30.341
long time to set up its pretty
sloppy in the side of the
Russians >> You remember I said

00:43:34.045-->00:43:40.785
you control the environment,
going to a cafe where you can
say you can observe, you are in

00:43:40.785-->00:43:45.790
control, so the 2 guys in the
middle are the target of course,
now what they’re actually doing

00:43:48.826-->00:43:54.899
isn’t overly suspicious in a
cafe passing in between two bags
however, this footage was taken

00:43:54.899-->00:43:59.904
from a covered camera in a bag
placed on the tabe about 6 feet
away pointing directly at them.

00:44:04.342-->00:44:09.347
No one does that ever. This
thing about being observant and
looking in an using your

00:44:11.582-->00:44:17.321
surrounding but it also shows
the length of the surveillance
team will go to get close enough

00:44:17.321-->00:44:23.427
to get the evidence they need.
>> this is the other thing,
they’re putting a operators

00:44:23.427-->00:44:29.700
really close to the target, this
is burning distance right. At
this point the person’s leg is

00:44:29.700-->00:44:36.507
one of the operators and if you
watch the whole footage there’s
other people that has

00:44:36.507-->00:44:41.512
interaction with the leg. So
there’s like 3 FBI people in
here and they did not spot them.

00:44:44.515-->00:44:49.520
>>Bad on them >> So I say we
can’t cover everything in 45
minutes so in summary use your

00:44:56.794-->00:45:01.732
environment, you are in control,
you choose where you want to go
and make them follow you not you

00:45:04.769-->00:45:10.408
be aware they’re waiting for
you. >> You can set the tempo
because they’re following you,

00:45:10.408-->00:45:16.113
you’re the leader, change the
tempo and change it on them.
They’ll hate it >> Make them

00:45:16.113-->00:45:21.118
make decisions, again make them
make bad decisions so they all
showing out they all making

00:45:26.357-->00:45:31.362
themselves obvious to you as the
target, the best one is if you
can divide and conquer, get them

00:45:35.132-->00:45:40.304
totally look at the wrong
direction or you get a team to
split so you get half the amount

00:45:40.304-->00:45:45.309
of people operating against you.
>>Always make toast, that’s the
key thing here, if you do happen

00:45:49.914-->00:45:56.053
to be a target or maybe doing
things that you shouldn’t be
doing? Not that no one here is

00:45:56.053-->00:46:02.226
slightly to be targeted
surveillance >>that never
happens >> If you are doing and

00:46:02.226-->00:46:08.599
you are going to meet someone,
if you are press, you are going
to meet, a source for example

00:46:08.599-->00:46:13.604
>>combine bath salts with
bitcoins whatever >> if you ever
are in doubt if you were ever in

00:46:16.073-->00:46:21.812
that position, abort. You may
been to surveillance but abort
so that you don't then drool

00:46:21.812-->00:46:26.817
someone else into their circle.
Now everything that we said on
this talk is in the public

00:46:29.820-->00:46:35.893
domain, I haven’t given away
this super secret, I haven’t
knowingly broken any official

00:46:35.893-->00:46:42.700
secret sect. >>That’s important
for you, I’m not covered by that
>>so please don't arrest me if I

00:46:42.700-->00:46:47.705
try to leave the country because
that doesn’t happen over here
>>And all this stuff is public,

00:46:49.940-->00:46:55.579
if you read this book, it all
covers the same stuff. >> So
that concludes the talk. And

00:46:55.579-->00:47:00.751
we’ve just ran over we will take
questions, but we will do it in
the chill out area so that the

00:47:00.751-->00:47:05.756
next speaker can get on here,
thank you very much for
listening. Thank you. [Applause]
