00:00:00.133-->00:00:04.171
>>When you’re a younger person
who runs for office, the last
thing you want to do is run for

00:00:04.171-->00:00:06.740
office, especially when you
don’t have your own. That just
looks weird and so I don’t want

00:00:06.740-->00:00:11.879
to go there. Alright. My name is
Daniel Zolnikov and I’m a
Montana state representative and

00:00:11.879-->00:00:15.849
we’re gonna talk about politics
in the surveillance state and
there’s one thing that might be

00:00:15.849-->00:00:21.288
a uh some of you kind of catch
is all this is obscure. For
example I’m from a town called

00:00:21.288-->00:00:26.660
Roundup, Montana, I’m 31 years
old. I uh actually first served
in the legislature at 25 years

00:00:26.660-->00:00:32.432
old. Currently I chair the House
Energy and Technology Committee
in the State house. Yeah, they

00:00:32.432-->00:00:38.238
let a Russian help dictate uh
energy and technology policy for
not only Montana but the the

00:00:38.238-->00:00:43.243
northwest. That’s a scary thing,
especially in today’s politics
if you ask me. Um, I am a

00:00:45.846-->00:00:51.919
Republican and that may even
seem crazier wi- with this issue
but I’m gonna talk about the

00:00:51.919-->00:00:58.725
politics on these issues. And
try to help clearly dictate how
you can push for both sides of

00:00:58.725-->00:01:03.931
the aisle and hopefully pass
some of the laws we’ve passed in
Montana. Uh we have two terms in

00:01:03.931-->00:01:08.235
Montana so again we have term
limits after four terms. I’m
running for my fourth term, the

00:01:08.235-->00:01:13.273
fact that the term limits allows
us to go up in inf- influence
and power quicker. That’s why I

00:01:13.273-->00:01:18.011
get to chair the committee, do
one more chairmanship and then
I’m out. And it also means each

00:01:18.011-->00:01:23.817
of our voices are a lot stronger
even if we’re younger or newer.
Uh random facts about me. I am a

00:01:23.817-->00:01:28.822
swimmer. I am a current MBA
student. I previously spoke at
DefCon 21 where I did not do my

00:01:28.822-->00:01:34.528
shot. So. That’s why I had to
come back. Um I’m half Russian.
I’m half Italian. And that’s a

00:01:34.528-->00:01:40.334
lot of chaos mixed in it all and
last fun fact is I still use a
Blackberry. I just thought I’d

00:01:40.334-->00:01:44.338
throw that out there at a tech
conference to just. [laughter]
Ok, so why am I here. What have

00:01:44.338-->00:01:49.009
I done, what is the legislation
I’ve worked and passed to law. A
lot of politicians say what

00:01:49.009-->00:01:53.647
they’ve worked on, but they
never talk about if it passed or
not. These all passed into law.

00:01:53.647-->00:01:59.252
In 2013 I passed a bill that uh
required a warrant for GPS
location. No one knew about it

00:01:59.252-->00:02:03.457
and no one cared and then um
Edward Snowden came out. We’ll
talk a little more about all

00:02:03.457-->00:02:08.628
these later on. 2015 I passed
the strongest nation, th- the
nation’s strongest freedom of

00:02:08.628-->00:02:13.133
the press law in Montana. I also
passed a bill for medical
immunity for minors. That has

00:02:13.133-->00:02:17.337
nothing to do with this speech,
but it’s a really good bill that
if you’re under 21 and dying,

00:02:17.337-->00:02:22.743
you call 9 1, no one gets an
MIP, you just get them to the
hospital. Uh co-sponsored asset

00:02:22.743-->00:02:27.748
forfeiture, uh in 2015 as well.
Uh also in 2017 more recently I
carried a bill that required a

00:02:31.451-->00:02:37.958
warrant for electronic devices.
All devices, that bill is state
law in Montana. Carried a bill

00:02:37.958-->00:02:42.729
that required a warrant of
fourth amendment subpoena
requirements which was like a

00:02:42.729-->00:02:46.266
special kind of subpoena that
had a follow the fourth
amendment for electronic

00:02:46.266-->00:02:51.238
communications. That passed into
law. I put severe limits on
license plate readers in

00:02:51.238-->00:02:57.511
Montana. Uh that passed into law
and did major reforms and
restrictions for vehicle spot

00:02:57.511-->00:03:02.449
checks in Montana. Uh also law.
So we’re gonna go through a
series [applause] oh yeah.

00:03:04.718-->00:03:09.389
[applause] Thank you. [applause]
I’m actually just here to get
you guys to move to my state and

00:03:09.389-->00:03:14.127
invest in the big tech companies
and things along those lines. So
if you like skiing and hiking.

00:03:14.127-->00:03:19.866
Uh shameless promotion for
Montana. So first and fourth
amendment. I know, some of this

00:03:19.866-->00:03:23.703
I’m gonna cover, you’re gonna
know a little bit about and
that’s fine. I just am doing it

00:03:23.703-->00:03:28.775
just it’s nice to touch on it
again. First amendment protects
the freedom of speech, religion,

00:03:28.775-->00:03:35.649
press, assembly and to petition
the government. Uh and am a what
you call a liberty conservative

00:03:35.649-->00:03:41.054
or constitutional conservative.
Very similar lines where I like
the constitution. Uh and I like

00:03:41.054-->00:03:46.093
uh all I think all of it, I like
all of the constitution.
Especially the Bill of Rights is

00:03:46.093-->00:03:51.431
what I focus on. So. First
amendment, freedom of speech, uh
the nation is founded on the

00:03:51.431-->00:03:57.637
concept that we can share ideas,
be who we want, do uh what we
want with our lives. If you want

00:03:57.637-->00:04:01.174
to go into technology, you can
do it. Education you can do it,
it doesn’t matter. We have

00:04:01.174-->00:04:07.481
opportunity here and the idea to
talk and have conversations is
huge in this nation. The fourth

00:04:07.481-->00:04:11.885
amendment prevents the
government from unreasonable
searches and seizures of their

00:04:11.885-->00:04:17.891
houses uh on them. Their cars,
their papers and effects and you
need probable cause for that.

00:04:17.891-->00:04:23.163
Well, without probable cause you
know the government's listening,
looking, watching and you’re

00:04:23.163-->00:04:27.734
more likely to censor your
freedom of speech, express,
discuss, talk, live and now you

00:04:27.734-->00:04:33.840
are no longer in a free society.
So why isn’t our data ours? And
this is why the fourth amendment

00:04:33.840-->00:04:38.011
doesn’t apply to our data as
third party doctrine which is a
legal theory states that your

00:04:38.011-->00:04:44.417
information really isn’t yours.
If I send you a text message, it
goes through Verizon. Verizon is

00:04:44.417-->00:04:48.655
the third party, now there’s no
eh- expectation of privacy
through that digital

00:04:48.655-->00:04:54.294
communication and through uh
court cases and legal doctri-
legal theory this isn’t

00:04:54.294-->00:04:59.799
considered your e-mail or your
private information anymore. You
shared it with somebody. Thus

00:04:59.799-->00:05:04.804
why your data can be mask
collected by government
agencies. Uh there are also

00:05:04.804-->00:05:09.809
outdated laws from the 80s a
little bit updated in the 90s.
But also uh have very limited

00:05:11.845-->00:05:17.918
protections of your digital
communications. Uh also the
Patriot Act which I would rather

00:05:17.918-->00:05:22.822
like to say the Un-Patriot Act
is the expanded government’s
ability to monitor, collect and

00:05:22.822-->00:05:27.294
retain the data of Americans and
then they don’t de- then they
can delay or not even notify you

00:05:27.294-->00:05:34.234
of some of these searches. So
your data technically is just
not yours. And that le- led to

00:05:34.234-->00:05:39.039
these other problems.
Technically gov- the data’s not
yours. So then we have the NSA

00:05:39.039-->00:05:44.411
of course we all learn 5 years
in continuously the mass data
collection of your digital

00:05:44.411-->00:05:49.082
communications and then there
are private companies who took
part in this through back door

00:05:49.082-->00:05:54.120
channels. Microsoft, Google,
Yahoo, Facebook, YouTube, Skype,
Apple. They all participated.

00:05:54.120-->00:06:00.193
Um. So there’s a problem of you
have your data, it’s not
considered yours and now through

00:06:00.193-->00:06:06.099
large companies, it’s siphoned
into a database of the federal
government to simplify this. I

00:06:06.099-->00:06:09.603
know it gets a lot more
technical, but let’s just keep
this simple. Um, then there’s

00:06:09.603-->00:06:14.307
secret courts that are supposed
to have checks and balances over
the government, which of course

00:06:14.307-->00:06:18.378
we know these secret courts uh,
a court that’s secret is not
open to the public, the public

00:06:18.378-->00:06:23.250
cannot be critical and hold them
accountable when nobody really
knows, plus the people who are

00:06:23.250-->00:06:27.954
appointed on the secret court
are appointed by the supreme
court justice who’s appointed by

00:06:27.954-->00:06:33.693
a president so there’s like 3 or
4 levels of not being
accountable to the people once

00:06:33.693-->00:06:38.698
again. Um and from the the late
70s to the early 2013, the court
rejected like 11 out of 33-->000

00:06:41.301-->00:06:48.074
requests. All I know is it was a
very low number which means they
were rubber stamping basically

00:06:48.074-->00:06:52.946
every request. Um then the
national D DA license plate and
facial recognition tracking

00:06:52.946-->00:06:58.652
program uh is another one that
came out a few years ago that we
learned about through the ACLU

00:06:58.652-->00:07:05.158
foia request for information
act. That the DEA had a national
database of your driving

00:07:05.158-->00:07:11.898
information so if you are a
local individual in Las Vegas
driving around, you are likely

00:07:11.898-->00:07:16.603
having your picture taken uh
with these license plate readers
either on vehicles or on bridges

00:07:16.603-->00:07:20.573
and infrastructure of your
vehicle, of the license plate
and of the people in it. This is

00:07:20.573-->00:07:25.545
me taking pictures of you. So
they’re just taking these
pictures all the time. Well a

00:07:25.545-->00:07:30.817
lot of times local law
enforcement work with national
uh agencies. They upload the

00:07:30.817-->00:07:35.488
data and so even if there’s good
rules of the data short term in
your state, this data is being

00:07:35.488-->00:07:39.459
uploaded nationally into a
database that’s forever and
connect all license plates

00:07:39.459-->00:07:43.730
across the country and the
people in the vehicles and
that’s permanent and we don’t

00:07:43.730-->00:07:49.569
know what’s happening with it
and how big of a database and
where it’s going. So not my

00:07:49.569-->00:07:55.408
favorite um not my favorite
route of where the third party
doctrine has led us. And then

00:07:55.408-->00:07:59.412
they got people which this is
like the worst thing. This just
bothers me completely is we have

00:07:59.412-->00:08:04.918
nothing to hide. I uh there’s
there’s so many philosophies
based on the freedom of speech

00:08:04.918-->00:08:08.521
expression that we kind of
talked about already, but there
are major problems with self

00:08:08.521-->00:08:13.393
censorship. First off if you
have nothing to hide, you’re
probably really boring and

00:08:13.393-->00:08:17.764
haven’t lived a single day of
your life. Because I don’t know
about you, but I have a lot to

00:08:17.764-->00:08:22.769
hide. Right? Like I went to
college and I had a great time.
[laughter] Um let me give a good

00:08:25.839-->00:08:30.844
example of the problems with
self censorship. So we’re
driving in rural Montana, which

00:08:34.013-->00:08:40.587
all you will one day visit, I
hope. And the radio is on some
great like 80s song pops on that

00:08:40.587-->00:08:44.491
you love. And you just crank it
up, there’s nobody out there,
there’s nobody listening,

00:08:44.491-->00:08:48.161
there’s nobody watching. Your
windows are down because it’s
not 100 degrees like it is here.

00:08:48.161-->00:08:53.099
You’re just cruising and you
just start singing that song and
you don’t care and you sing that

00:08:53.099-->00:08:57.570
song when you just scream
because you know you have the
best voice, right? Put that same

00:08:57.570-->00:09:01.941
person in a scenario in a city,
say Las Vegas. Driving down the
street and their favorite song

00:09:01.941-->00:09:06.513
comes on and they crank it up
and they start singing, they
look over and somebody’s looking

00:09:06.513-->00:09:12.185
at them. They’re most likely
going to turn the volume down
and maybe not scream at the top

00:09:12.185-->00:09:15.889
of their lungs because it’s
their favorite song in the
world. That is a for of

00:09:15.889-->00:09:22.061
censorship, because when you
know somebody’s watching you you
change your actions even if you

00:09:22.061-->00:09:27.901
don’t know you actually changed
your actions. Um and that
applies to government. So if I’m

00:09:27.901-->00:09:33.039
having a conversation with you,
then we can talk about whatever
you want. You bring a microphone

00:09:33.039-->00:09:39.779
in it, I’m a politician, I might
censor myself a little bit. You
know, I know that my phone is uh

00:09:39.779-->00:09:45.919
recording everything I’m saying
in a national database. You will
most likely keep that in the

00:09:45.919-->00:09:49.789
back of your mind. You may not
censor a lot of you’re talking
about what pizza you’re gonna

00:09:49.789-->00:09:52.892
get. Who cares. If you’re
talking about something else
that’s no one’s business. Some

00:09:52.892-->00:09:58.598
idea, whatever. That will likely
force you to change your
actions. And if you’re changing

00:09:58.598-->00:10:03.203
your actions due to the fear and
threat of government, you are no
longer in as free of a country

00:10:03.203-->00:10:07.907
as you thought you were and that
means you’re reacting out of
fear even if it’s a fear that

00:10:07.907-->00:10:13.680
has not led to any logical
conclusions yet. Um it’s
something to keep in mind. One

00:10:13.680-->00:10:17.784
other thing I want to touch on
was Montana literally 100 years
ago had some of the worst

00:10:17.784-->00:10:23.590
Sedition Acts in the country
where if you spoke German you
were uh beaten, ju- uh, you were

00:10:23.590-->00:10:29.162
arrested, beaten and imprisoned.
If you said you didn’t support
the war you were arrested,

00:10:29.162-->00:10:34.834
beaten, imprisoned. If you said
some of the companies have
horrible um uh conditions for

00:10:34.834-->00:10:41.107
work and labor you were
arrested, beaten and imprisoned.
And so really bad laws where you

00:10:41.107-->00:10:44.744
were not allowed to have
anything, say anything, if you
didn’t buy bonds then you were

00:10:44.744-->00:10:50.316
also considered like maybe
treasonous. Uh really bad. So in
100 years, we wanted to uh- we

00:10:50.316-->00:10:54.754
were basically able to go from
the worst, one of the worst
states in the nation. Which

00:10:54.754-->00:10:58.958
these laws were pass- passed
federally for a period of time
too. To literally one of the

00:10:58.958-->00:11:02.996
best states in the nation
regarding having um solid
privacy rights. The last thing I

00:11:02.996-->00:11:08.101
wanted to touch on is you may
have nothing to hide, but one
day you might. We only know what

00:11:08.101-->00:11:12.205
we know and what we live
through, but all scenarios
change, all governments chang

00:11:12.205-->00:11:17.043
and history has proved that
everything that has ever existed
1-->000 years ago, has changed.

00:11:17.043-->00:11:22.382
And almost 500 years ago, 400
years ago in forms of
governments, they always change.

00:11:22.382-->00:11:27.720
K, so we’re going to touch on
some quick historical examples
of why this is relevant today at

00:11:27.720-->00:11:33.126
least in the last 50 years.
First one, J. Edgar Hoover, he
had documents, information on

00:11:33.126-->00:11:38.631
congressman, uh senators and he
would leverage them and say hey
we know you had sex with this

00:11:38.631-->00:11:42.769
person over here, you really
don’t want your wife to know or
your voters to know, so please

00:11:42.769-->00:11:48.374
do what we want. That happened
in our government which means
that our legislative branch, the

00:11:48.374-->00:11:54.247
voice of the people was actually
not truly representing the
people, it was representing fear

00:11:54.247-->00:11:58.117
at one point. Now it’s not like
J. Edgar Hoover was asking for a
lot all these times, but the

00:11:58.117-->00:12:03.823
whole concept was our our
government was uh hijacked for a
period of time out of fear. Even

00:12:03.823-->00:12:10.797
presidents feared the guy and he
tried to blackmail Martin Luther
King uh Junior to stop. Uh with

00:12:10.797-->00:12:15.802
sex tapes actually that uh did
not stop him. But one person
with data can do crazy scary

00:12:19.138-->00:12:23.810
things in our country. Uh
Watergate is just proof how
political parties will do

00:12:23.810-->00:12:30.617
whatever they can to collect,
obtain data on their ad-
adversaries or enemies or their

00:12:30.617-->00:12:35.822
um their opposition to beat
them. This speech after I give
it, if it’s uploaded or

00:12:35.822-->00:12:38.391
whatever, it will be sought
through, it will be gone
through, they’ll be looking for

00:12:38.391-->00:12:42.929
me to say one or two lines that
I said something wrong or dumb.
Which I say that all the time so

00:12:42.929-->00:12:49.202
they have plenty of material.
Um. Last one’s East Germany with
uh in you know East Germany, you

00:12:49.202-->00:12:53.806
know East Germany was the part
that was ho- um held by
Communist Russia and with the

00:12:53.806-->00:12:58.711
Stasi and they were only able to
tap 40 phones at a time. They
were able to silence and keep an

00:12:58.711-->00:13:03.349
entire country or at least that
region of the country in fear of
their government where people

00:13:03.349-->00:13:08.821
would actually tell on their
families and friends uh very
scary. Um. Very scary but real

00:13:08.821-->00:13:15.561
example. So we kind of talked
about how to use these tools on
how to take over the world, but

00:13:15.561-->00:13:21.301
they are they’re they’re real
because you have a huge amount
of data on everybody in this

00:13:21.301-->00:13:26.005
room and everybody in the
especially people who are
running for office. You have

00:13:26.005-->00:13:31.010
examples of how data was used to
blackmail, leverage uh expose,
discredit individuals and as you

00:13:33.713-->00:13:38.985
know in politics today I know
it’s fa- everybody’s favorite
topic, but you get one person

00:13:38.985-->00:13:43.990
who can bend the the oversight
or access that information, they
could stop anybody they want to,

00:13:49.095-->00:13:54.901
um and that is a real thing.
That’s not like some conspiracy
theory. If you had a, if you’re

00:13:54.901-->00:14:01.641
in the powerful position, you
could stop anybody politically.
So there are some limits and

00:14:01.641-->00:14:05.945
standards worth imposing. I
would love the data be deleted
if it’s not, how about we do

00:14:05.945-->00:14:10.783
what this country is based on,
which was checks and balances.
Um required records of searches

00:14:10.783-->00:14:17.724
of the mass data collected, who
searched it, why were they
searching? At some point,

00:14:17.724-->00:14:22.895
release this collected
information and insure that that
way knowing that what you

00:14:22.895-->00:14:26.365
searched and who you searched
and why you searched is released
one day, we’ll know that one day

00:14:26.365-->00:14:31.404
you’ll be held accountable so
you might think twice about what
you do today. Um, have a better

00:14:31.404-->00:14:36.409
court system that is overseeing
this. Either have it have a more
public process or again uh a

00:14:39.545-->00:14:45.218
more transparent one. Have
burdens of proof for the data
that is requested for when

00:14:45.218-->00:14:51.023
people’s information is being
softened through these mass
databases um that there’s fourth

00:14:51.023-->00:14:53.993
amendment standards or
notification standards. If
you’re ever, if your

00:14:53.993-->00:14:57.463
information’s ever sought
through to see if you were
involved in any criminal

00:14:57.463-->00:15:03.369
activities with your cell phone
number and all the messages or
your e-mail or whatever they

00:15:03.369-->00:15:08.374
use, have notification standards
to ensure that one day you’re
gonna know. So unless they

00:15:08.374-->00:15:12.779
really know your’e guilty of
something they’re gonna think
twice. These are pretty solid

00:15:12.779-->00:15:17.784
and easy and uh basic limits and
standards worth considering.
Considering. So, story time. Uh

00:15:20.553-->00:15:25.558
I ran for office at 25 I knocked
a lot of doors, I knocked doors
for months. I called for, called

00:15:31.130-->00:15:35.802
people for months. I had to
raise money, it was a great
time. Um, it’s something that I

00:15:35.802-->00:15:39.505
wish everyone else would
acknowledge and appreciate
because you think of

00:15:39.505-->00:15:45.711
politicians, you these guys, who
need like money and like doing
all these evil deeds, but it is

00:15:45.711-->00:15:52.318
a lot of it is it is not
glamorous, put it this way. It
is a lot of alone and you’re

00:15:52.318-->00:15:56.088
trying to just talk to people
and knock on doors and get
elected so you can actually do

00:15:56.088-->00:16:00.426
something good. Especially the
newer politicians, like not
newer as in the guys who used to

00:16:00.426-->00:16:04.730
run, but someone who’s new and
running for the first time,
there’s a lot of idealism behind

00:16:04.730-->00:16:10.736
that and uh a lot of effort and
they’re challenging an entire
system uh that they’ve never

00:16:10.736-->00:16:15.608
really experienced most likely
before. So every state is
different, my state is a smaller

00:16:15.608-->00:16:19.912
state, other states are larger,
some have donation limits, um
represent more people, some

00:16:19.912-->00:16:24.917
represent less people, some
rural, some are uh urban, more
urban states. Uh anyone can run,

00:16:26.986-->00:16:32.091
but keeping that in mind uh if
people do run, it is smart to
have a strategy not a plan. I

00:16:32.091-->00:16:35.094
know a lot of people who are
like, I’m going to run, I’m
going to go talk to people,

00:16:35.094-->00:16:38.898
people are going to care about
what I say and then they’re
gonna like me and I’m gonna get

00:16:38.898-->00:16:44.437
elected. And really it’s no, you
got to obtain fundraising and
you have to use that to market

00:16:44.437-->00:16:48.107
yourself because people care
about the presidential race,
maybe the governor race, but our

00:16:48.107-->00:16:53.446
bottom, lesser races, they kind
of go by the wayside. So you
have to have a strategy.

00:16:53.446-->00:17:00.152
Everybody has a plan to get
elected and change the world,
you got to have a strategy. Uh

00:17:00.152-->00:17:04.090
so I’m going to talk about a
little of my experiences. I’ve
befriended befriended colleagues

00:17:04.090-->00:17:08.194
on both sides of the aisle when
I first was elected. I just
didn’t like politics but I liked

00:17:08.194-->00:17:13.199
people um so I was I saw no
reason not to befriend somebody
super far left, I’m pretty

00:17:16.469-->00:17:22.575
conservative liberty. Uh there’s
people in the middle, on both
sides and it was very valuable

00:17:22.575-->00:17:28.481
and it was not a strategy just
luck that I tried to do a
privacy bill of rights 2013, it

00:17:28.481-->00:17:32.518
failed, said your data is yours,
you need consent to collect.
There’s got to be security. Um

00:17:32.518-->00:17:38.524
it was well intended, but not
well written, so where it landed
is probably where it should

00:17:38.524-->00:17:42.628
have, but the lobbyist wanted to
make an example of me, because I
told them I don’t like them and

00:17:42.628-->00:17:47.633
other words. And um I created a
reputation that I’m not easy to
work with and that’s not true.

00:17:52.605-->00:17:57.343
I’m very easy to work with if
you don’t lie to me and you
negotiate so I make sure

00:17:57.343-->00:18:03.215
whatever bill I’m working on
gets 90 percent of what I want
[laughter]. Ok, so um but then I

00:18:03.215-->00:18:08.454
talked with a democrat senator
whose like, Daniel, your bill
failed, but we really liked what

00:18:08.454-->00:18:12.058
you attempted to do or I like
what you attempted to do, so why
don’t you try to do GPS warrant

00:18:12.058-->00:18:17.596
requirement bill? And I said, ok
and so democrats knew I didn’t
care about like working my way

00:18:17.596-->00:18:22.601
up. Republicans knew that um I
have pretty conservative values
and I really like our freedoms a

00:18:25.271-->00:18:30.076
lot. Enough passionately to
basically ruin my political
career in three weeks of being

00:18:30.076-->00:18:35.081
elected. So [laughter] um I
think that basically not being I
mean it us- eh uses motto for

00:18:37.516-->00:18:42.321
life, but don’t be a d**k. LIke
that applies to life, but also
applies really well to politics

00:18:42.321-->00:18:46.525
because I gave a really good
simple bill that we ended up
passing in Montana being the

00:18:46.525-->00:18:51.530
first one to pass it. Um 2015,
went back and I was like and I
had a whole slew of these

00:18:53.666-->00:18:58.971
privacy bills that needed to
have good uh precedents set
nationally. And the one that

00:18:58.971-->00:19:03.709
ended up passing was the freedom
of the press for privacy saying
the digital communications of

00:19:03.709-->00:19:07.246
the press cannot ever be
obtained. There are no
exceptions. They can never be

00:19:07.246-->00:19:11.651
obtained. Freedom of the press
is the watchdog of the
government, although it’s very

00:19:11.651-->00:19:16.655
bartisan and biased and probably
not doing as well a job as they
could be from when this was

00:19:16.655-->00:19:21.594
historically written, without it
we look like North Korea, where
you don’t know anything and the

00:19:21.594-->00:19:25.798
only government, or the only
media you hear is state
sponsored and that’s never good.

00:19:25.798-->00:19:30.703
It’s never good. So that bill
ended up passing. My warrants
for devices and digital

00:19:30.703-->00:19:35.708
communications bill failed in
2015, later passed in 2017. But
that ended up failing because of

00:19:37.943-->00:19:42.882
politics and the there was a lot
of misinformation from
prosecutors and law enforcement,

00:19:42.882-->00:19:48.788
how if we pass these bills uh
like we’re never going to pass
rape victims and uh I don’t

00:19:48.788-->00:19:53.726
know. Make up the argument,
that’s what I had to defend
against. Um, the bill li- limits

00:19:53.726-->00:19:57.196
on license plates readers and
spot check legislation, that
also failed. There were some

00:19:57.196-->00:20:01.901
people on the other side of the
aisle, who uh, tried to leverage
my vote which I did not give up.

00:20:01.901-->00:20:05.337
There were some people on my
side of the aisle who just
thought I was a arrogant punk

00:20:05.337-->00:20:10.609
and they wanted to put me in my
place. And I can’t always argue
with guys on my side of the

00:20:10.609-->00:20:14.847
aisle, sometimes I can be a
little bit of a punk, but I
don’t think they should kill

00:20:14.847-->00:20:20.219
legislation based on my
personality. They thought they
should have. So I’m going to

00:20:20.219-->00:20:25.057
tell you one thing, I spoke at
DefCon 21. Edward Snowden came
out. It was real life, I passed

00:20:25.057-->00:20:31.697
the first uh privacy bill of its
type in the nation 5 years ago.
Forbes put me on their 30 under

00:20:31.697-->00:20:37.636
30 list and all of a sudden I
got more positive national press
than anybody else in Montana

00:20:37.636-->00:20:42.108
politics. That’s not a bragging
thing. Why I’m telling you that
is it helped me cause people

00:20:42.108-->00:20:46.112
wanted to take me out
politically. They wanted to
remove me from office and I was

00:20:46.112-->00:20:50.683
not removed because you can’t
take the guy who’s getting all
the positive press in your

00:20:50.683-->00:20:55.087
party. And so su- and it is the
conservative who were on my
side, there were just some of

00:20:55.087-->00:21:01.827
the other guys who were not and
a lot of the industry was not.
So the power of DefCon 21 is

00:21:01.827-->00:21:07.199
actually what allowed me to come
back up here with successes that
uh that I’m going to talk about

00:21:07.199-->00:21:12.204
in a few minutes. So thank you
all. [applause] So one thing
about this legislation though

00:21:17.877-->00:21:23.115
that I realize the importance of
model state legislation we
passed that GPS privacy bills,

00:21:23.115-->00:21:28.120
other states started passing
that GPS privacy bill and there
was a proof that we can do it

00:21:28.120-->00:21:34.793
successfully. So Montana being
that passing that bill was about
Utah then passing and Main then

00:21:34.793-->00:21:40.065
passing it and as some of you
may or may not know in 2018 the
Supreme case Supreme court case

00:21:40.065-->00:21:45.104
ruling stated that there is a
warrant there should be or it
deems there is a warrant

00:21:45.104-->00:21:50.109
requirement for GPS uh location
to to obtain that, which means
that the entire country is now

00:21:53.112-->00:21:58.117
under that that uh that ruling.
So one state it can create a
whole precedent. [applause] So

00:22:00.386-->00:22:05.391
next was my third term, so I I
didn’t explain one thing. We
serve 4 months every other year,

00:22:12.665-->00:22:17.670
so we had to do all of these
bills in 4 months a- um every
other year. So I actually only

00:22:20.206-->00:22:24.043
had a year to do these bills. I
actually only had 2 months to
pass through our body and then

00:22:24.043-->00:22:30.249
the other body. So it’s like
very time crunch period, um so
third term I had an election,

00:22:30.249-->00:22:35.020
second most expensive primary my
seat became more conservative
because I was rediserted, so I

00:22:35.020-->00:22:40.025
had a very expensive lo- primary
with industry, law enforcement
uh uh basically anybody from the

00:22:42.228-->00:22:48.767
contractors, hospitals,
utilities, a lot of money spent
against me. Um because they knew

00:22:48.767-->00:22:54.874
if I won I would first off I’m
gonna keep trying to do my
privacy bills and also I’ll be

00:22:54.874-->00:22:59.078
the chair of the energy and
technology committee, Montana’s
an energy state, that wasn’t

00:22:59.078-->00:23:05.818
some people’s ideal uh result,
that’s not who they wanted to be
chairing that committee. So

00:23:05.818-->00:23:10.823
again with term limits I won
that election, I uh got to um
chair that committee and when

00:23:13.192-->00:23:15.794
you’re chairing a committee,
people are a lot nicer to you,
because they know something of

00:23:15.794-->00:23:19.398
theirs might go through that
committee and then your future.
So it’s amazing how some of

00:23:19.398-->00:23:23.702
these bills have a lot less,
there is a lot less leverage for
my vote on the house floor

00:23:23.702-->00:23:28.207
because people are like yeah
that’s a bad idea. Let’s just
leave Daniel alone and bother

00:23:28.207-->00:23:33.212
somebody else. So nice, nice uh
term limits do have their
benefits right? Uh so 2017,

00:23:35.748-->00:23:39.485
these are the bills I kind of
touched on but we passed the
warrant requirement for digital

00:23:39.485-->00:23:45.257
communications and there was I
uh some of these model bills
that are now in law in Montana,

00:23:45.257-->00:23:51.830
there had to be a few um meeting
a little bit in the middle. Like
notification was 90 or it was 6

00:23:51.830-->00:23:55.968
wait 6 months versus 3 months of
notification standards if they
ever go through digital

00:23:55.968-->00:24:00.572
communications. There were some
other things along those lines,
but I still think it’s a pretty

00:24:00.572-->00:24:05.044
solid model bill that Montana
passed. Warrant requirements for
devices. You need a warrant to

00:24:05.044-->00:24:08.147
go through electronic devices.
They can’t pull you over, say
are you texting? Let me go

00:24:08.147-->00:24:13.218
through your phone. That’s not
going to happen in my state.
That’s like legally it can’t

00:24:13.218-->00:24:17.790
happen. Um or your computers or
whatever and we define devices
as things that haven’t been in

00:24:17.790-->00:24:21.760
invented yet either. That’s not
what it says in the definition,
but it’s a very broad

00:24:21.760-->00:24:26.298
definition. A lot of times when
you pass laws you make the
definitions to tight to not

00:24:26.298-->00:24:31.670
apply to the future, I did not
want to do that. Uh, then
license plate readers, we never

00:24:31.670-->00:24:35.941
had we did not have these yet in
the state, in my state, but they
were trying to get these put

00:24:35.941-->00:24:42.581
into um place and so I worked
with the well with the one of
the main guys in law enforcement

00:24:42.581-->00:24:46.018
in the state and probably one of
the most reasonable guys. He’s
like Daniel why do you want to

00:24:46.018-->00:24:51.557
ban these. I was like, national,
like databases of where we’ve
driven in Mont- like Montana

00:24:51.557-->00:24:56.528
being uh applied like and held
forever by our federal
government, I don’t want to take

00:24:56.528-->00:25:01.467
any part of that. So a- with the
exception um of a few certain
things like kidnappings, they

00:25:04.503-->00:25:10.809
can be used, the data’s
collected 90 days I think at
max, whoever goes through the

00:25:10.809-->00:25:16.148
data um has to be recorded of
who of what data they went
through, why they went through

00:25:16.148-->00:25:20.919
it and then if any other any
other law enforcement group
wants to obtain that

00:25:20.919-->00:25:26.191
information, they have to get a
warrant. So the if the sheriff’s
office wants the police

00:25:26.191-->00:25:31.096
department to have to get a
warrant, the federal government
wants the state state um police

00:25:31.096-->00:25:36.468
department or one of the police
departments have to get a
warrant with the defined license

00:25:36.468-->00:25:39.238
plate number they’re looking
for. That way they can’t get a
warrant for all the information

00:25:39.238-->00:25:44.810
ever, it’s the warrant of just
one license plate. So that
either means they have to do a

00:25:44.810-->00:25:51.316
few million request daily or
they aren’t gonna get our
information and hopefully

00:25:51.316-->00:25:56.989
they’re not, I don’t, I’m not a
prosecutor, so maybe there’s a
loophole I missed, but I tried

00:25:56.989-->00:26:03.262
to basically say, you could use
it for very close limited
things, but not for pulling

00:26:03.262-->00:26:08.200
somebody over because they have
a a license like a license
that’s expired or something.

00:26:08.200-->00:26:14.807
Like, it’s not really the big
crimes we’re worried about. Um.
So that’s the the license plate

00:26:14.807-->00:26:19.578
reader law that’s in place, then
vehicle spot checks, we really
reformed those so you can’t just

00:26:19.578-->00:26:22.481
pull people over. I keep, that
has nothing to do with
technology, but it has to do

00:26:22.481-->00:26:26.985
with the civil liberty side of
things. And then also this whole
time I was working on like like

00:26:26.985-->00:26:32.558
handfuls of energy policy. And
uh um that were good, some
removed special laws from huge

00:26:32.558-->00:26:36.028
corporations which I know a lot
of people in this this group
would probably like. [audience]

00:26:36.028-->00:26:40.966
So passing the bills, this is a
little bit more par- this is
where it becomes more applicable

00:26:40.966-->00:26:46.205
to you if you want to apply it
in the future. Um so my question
here is what do gun groups, the

00:26:46.205-->00:26:51.210
ACLU like family like Christian
organizations, hackers, citizens
and I forgot to add into there

00:26:53.445-->00:26:59.651
libraries have in common? Those
were the people who supported my
legislation. So unique

00:26:59.651-->00:27:05.123
coalitions are key. So let me
say that again. You got, gun
groups and the ACLU and like

00:27:05.123-->00:27:10.229
family organizations and hacker
citizens and libraries. That is
the island of misfit toys

00:27:10.229-->00:27:15.234
politically. [laughter] You want
to talk about like a funky like
family dinnertime where like

00:27:21.073-->00:27:24.676
nobody should have even been
there and had a conversation?
That’s what my committees looked

00:27:24.676-->00:27:31.149
like when you had a prosecutors
who have been doing it for 15
years argue, could really

00:27:31.149-->00:27:36.555
influence, you got the
department of Justice, you have
members of law enforcement, um

00:27:36.555-->00:27:41.560
who else did we have? Those were
the main ones that showed up in
opposition and they um they were

00:27:44.963-->00:27:49.067
good. They were very good at
what they did. There was a lot
of misinformation that would

00:27:49.067-->00:27:53.639
lead you to argument, well if my
kid got kidnapped and you didn’t
have this in place, then this

00:27:53.639-->00:27:57.976
could really go and we couldn’t
catch these people. Well then
the whole argument would go into

00:27:57.976-->00:28:02.214
like license plate readers that
aren’t even in place yet. So
it’s like well if we don’t have

00:28:02.214-->00:28:07.052
something in place that’s not in
place yet, how could that impact
you catching the person who’s

00:28:07.052-->00:28:13.225
guilty. So I had to defend
against these impossible
arguments. Um or the whole like

00:28:13.225-->00:28:17.863
so there’s distractions or there
is just build up arguments where
they burn the whole thing down

00:28:17.863-->00:28:21.733
and all I was saying is all I’m
doing is just requesting a
fourth amendment warrant

00:28:21.733-->00:28:26.405
requirement. You can email, you
can get it, this is like for the
the warrant requirement for

00:28:26.405-->00:28:30.208
devices, you can email the
judge, they can sign it in
minutes. They could send it back

00:28:30.208-->00:28:35.981
to you. Boom. That’s it. Not
really some crazy stuff, like
I’m saying you can’t ever access

00:28:35.981-->00:28:40.986
this information, just do it the
proper way. So um, one with I’m
gonna touch I think with the

00:28:47.960-->00:28:53.699
yeah unique coalitions a little
bit later. But that goes back to
be nice to people. Um there was

00:28:53.699-->00:28:59.838
a lot of of republicans who had
never talked to the ACLU and
there was a lot of democrats who

00:28:59.838-->00:29:03.075
wouldn’t talk to the family
groups. You’d be surprised
somewhere along the lines what

00:29:03.075-->00:29:08.547
you have in common. We have 95
percent of everything in common.
I don’t think if your politics

00:29:08.547-->00:29:12.985
are diametrically opposed,
you’re a member of the NSA and
love every second of it. We

00:29:12.985-->00:29:18.924
still have almost everything in
common. I know it’s a crazy
statement to hear, but it is it

00:29:18.924-->00:29:24.596
is very true. Um I’ll touch on
that a little bit later. Uh our
efforts, so there were a lot of

00:29:24.596-->00:29:31.570
efforts to become a privacy
technology expert. I I’m not I’m
not a natural public speaker,

00:29:31.570-->00:29:35.307
reading isn’t my favorite thing,
especially technical reading,
especially technical reading of

00:29:35.307-->00:29:41.380
laws. Uh especially then looking
at 4 cases and amending them.
Learning how to negotiate. All

00:29:41.380-->00:29:46.385
these things, uh I had to teach
myself over 4 or 5 years. So
when somebody came up to me with

00:29:49.287-->00:29:53.992
a argument, I was able to stand
up and have the reasoning,
understanding and oppose it. We

00:29:53.992-->00:29:59.131
don’t have staff in my state. We
don’t have personal staff. So I
had to learn it all, negotiate

00:29:59.131-->00:30:04.436
it all and get on the ground and
call people out in committee and
lobby the votes, do all the

00:30:04.436-->00:30:09.374
votes. It wasn’t like a- a lot
of politicians come up. Their
staff do 90 percent of the work.

00:30:09.374-->00:30:13.412
Their the ones, their staff are
talking to their constituents.
No, I had a 10 minute little

00:30:13.412-->00:30:17.049
break, I’m on my computer
emailing back my constituents
while in session, then sitting

00:30:17.049-->00:30:22.387
back down, go in the hallway,
negotiating a bill that were
pretty big pieces of

00:30:22.387-->00:30:28.660
legislation. Emailing people out
‘til 9 or 10 at night with um
new amendments, getting it to

00:30:28.660-->00:30:33.198
the people to get them written
legally for our bill drops and
then going back at it in the

00:30:33.198-->00:30:38.203
morning. Non stop um so
basically had to become a
privacy technology and and and

00:30:40.205-->00:30:44.142
legislative expert. Um one thing
is there were groups who showed
up like I mentioned, there were

00:30:44.142-->00:30:48.880
groups who did not show up. I
talked about the ACL- -ish ACLU
showed up. Other type groups

00:30:48.880-->00:30:53.318
that you’d think are very
helpful weren’t even in the
room. Weren’t even in the state.

00:30:53.318-->00:30:56.621
So I was trying to pass some
good precedents, they didn’t
show up. I won’t call them out,

00:30:56.621-->00:31:01.960
just to be respectful, but I am,
they almost actually at one
point derailed my legislation

00:31:01.960-->00:31:07.566
and it infuriated me since I’ve
been working on it for 4 years.
Um so here’s here’s what we got,

00:31:07.566-->00:31:13.205
we got multiple model bills for
your states and that’s good
regarding government, but here’s

00:31:13.205-->00:31:18.410
my main failure is I try to
amend a bill saying you cannot
collect browser data and that

00:31:18.410-->00:31:23.415
failed 52 to 48. 48 to 52 on the
house floor. I believe your data
belongs to you. It’s like my

00:31:25.650-->00:31:30.489
philosophy that’s weird in
politics, but your data is your
personal information and if it’s

00:31:30.489-->00:31:35.494
obtained, just ask for consent.
Um so we’re gonna be working on
a bill like that a little bit

00:31:38.497-->00:31:43.502
more uh and it’s more for ISPs
not edge providers. Consent to
click is huge and also the other

00:31:47.272-->00:31:52.277
one that I’m going to be putting
more of my political capital
into is uh biometric data. I

00:31:56.081-->00:32:00.285
firmly believe even more than
personal data, personal browsing
data that biometric is complete-

00:32:00.285-->00:32:02.287
you, completely your property.
Working on the legislation, I’ve
got smart people working on

00:32:02.287-->00:32:04.289
that. Um I think it would go
through my committee, so at
least it would have a chance, a

00:32:04.289-->00:32:07.092
good chance of going through
half the legislature. See that’s
what happens when you get people

00:32:07.092-->00:32:10.829
in power for too long, they
start to move bills through
their committee, um but

00:32:10.829-->00:32:16.735
hopefully I think that’s a
really good precedent policy
that we could pass in Montana.

00:32:16.735-->00:32:22.808
So what drives politicians. Uh
influence, power, change, anger,
political involvement. Some

00:32:22.808-->00:32:25.811
people want to influence an
industry that they’re part of.
They think it’s the best way to

00:32:25.811-->00:32:30.115
do it. Some people just want
power. They were treated poorly
as a child and now it’s their

00:32:30.115-->00:32:34.186
way to get back at the world.
Who knows. I don’t know their
family background. But people

00:32:34.186-->00:32:39.057
want power and you can see it.
They, they just, they just, you
feel it, they want that

00:32:39.057-->00:32:42.961
influence, if there’s an edge,
they’re gonna find it. Some
people truly want to make change

00:32:42.961-->00:32:47.866
uh some people are just angry at
the whole system and the angry
people are harder to work with

00:32:47.866-->00:32:52.270
because they’re angry and they
want to be angry at you and at
everybody. And then there’s

00:32:52.270-->00:32:55.540
people who have been following
politics their whole life and
then they buyin to the rhetoric

00:32:55.540-->00:33:01.012
of both sides. And so they’re
just they’re through political
involvement that they’re driven

00:33:01.012-->00:33:06.885
and they listen to their left
wing or right wing media all the
time and that’s uh so those are

00:33:06.885-->00:33:11.323
those are the five major points
that I say drives politicians.
One thing to keep in mind if you

00:33:11.323-->00:33:14.726
ever talk to politicians in your
state about these issues, ‘cause
that’s what I’d like you to do,

00:33:14.726-->00:33:18.496
you’d be surprised how much
influence you have as an
individual on your politician.

00:33:18.496-->00:33:23.501
Is there are hundreds of issues.
People run for energy,
education, healthcare,

00:33:23.501-->00:33:28.506
transportation, taxes, family
issues, gun issues, I don’t
care, there are hundreds of

00:33:28.506-->00:33:34.246
issues, hundreds of issues and a
lot of the people who are
elected are older so your

00:33:34.246-->00:33:37.716
issues, my issues aren’t really
relevant to them. They’re not as
informed to them, that doesn’t

00:33:37.716-->00:33:42.187
mean they’re not core issues it
means that they don’t just study
all hundreds of issues. They

00:33:42.187-->00:33:47.225
kind of focus on theirs and
somebody else focuses on another
one and my legislature I focus

00:33:47.225-->00:33:50.528
on technology issues and other
um than energy issues. Then
other people will focus on

00:33:50.528-->00:33:55.901
healthcare and others education,
all along. All across the board.
But to expect people to care

00:33:55.901-->00:34:00.839
about your issue is a it’s it’s
a fair expectation. Yes, there
is a lot of issues, yes, it’s

00:34:03.642-->00:34:08.046
your job to know about them, but
to in expertise and be like, why
don’t you have fourth amendment

00:34:08.046-->00:34:10.982
standards on my digital
communications? They’re going to
be like, what are you even

00:34:10.982-->00:34:15.520
talking about? Because it’s not
an issue really that people
would know about and you have to

00:34:15.520-->00:34:19.858
be ok with that, so then you can
sit down and explain it with
explain to them what you’re

00:34:19.858-->00:34:25.130
talking about and why it’s
important. Um there are
political issues, there’s policy

00:34:25.130-->00:34:31.102
issues. Political issues are in
the news, crazy rhetoric. Policy
issues can be political issues,

00:34:31.102-->00:34:33.104
but sometimes they’re just like,
how can we make the budget fund
this group and what’s going on

00:34:33.104-->00:34:35.106
over here and this tax is not
bringing in a lot of money and
this one’s bringing a lot more

00:34:35.106-->00:34:37.108
and we have extra surplus here
and then pretty soon it gets
really wonky and nobody really

00:34:37.108-->00:34:42.113
wants to talk about it ‘cause
it’s really boring. So um,
political issues can be trendy,

00:34:50.889-->00:34:55.327
but they’re not the same as
policy issues and political
issues usually are the extremes

00:34:55.327-->00:35:00.732
on both sides. So if you jump on
board with that, you’re going to
be missing the policy side. Um

00:35:00.732-->00:35:04.502
it’s ok to not follow the trend,
it’s even better to do
legislation and that’s not

00:35:04.502-->00:35:08.907
trendy. No one’s really talking
about the- some of the
legislation we’d talked about

00:35:08.907-->00:35:14.279
here. Um and that’s ok because
it’s not partisan, it’s ok
because no one’s really talking

00:35:14.279-->00:35:19.484
about it, so it’s not like, if a
republican stands up for it, a
democratic is going to be

00:35:19.484-->00:35:25.690
against it. In other words, it’s
not political, it’s not full
partisan politics, there’s a

00:35:25.690-->00:35:30.662
chance that people can be like,
this is an easy bill we can all
support and push it through. So

00:35:30.662-->00:35:35.667
the fact it’s not political is
on your side. If you use it that
way. Um one last thing to

00:35:38.303-->00:35:43.174
remember with politicians, say I
have five bills, I have my two
priorities bills, I know they’re

00:35:43.174-->00:35:46.811
popular, I know they’re
important, I know I can get them
passed, but I got 3 or 4 other

00:35:46.811-->00:35:50.615
bills. Maybe 2 are for
constituents, 1 is kind of
important, it’s a technology

00:35:50.615-->00:35:54.285
bill that is important to some
constituents who bought it to
me, but it’s not my major

00:35:54.285-->00:36:00.425
priority. I’m just using that as
an example, um my political
capital is going to be focused

00:36:00.425-->00:36:06.364
on my most important bills to
me. Which mean you could be
leverage, you could have your be

00:36:06.364-->00:36:11.369
trading votes, um you could be
just asking the committee to
pass these ones, because the

00:36:11.369-->00:36:15.173
more you ask, the more they kind
of get annoyed with you. It
matters per state how they do

00:36:15.173-->00:36:19.878
their politics. Uh cutting
deals, it’s ll the, there’s all
the stuff behind the scenes

00:36:19.878-->00:36:24.582
you’ll never see. But there is
so much political capital, so
when someone’s like, oh this guy

00:36:24.582-->00:36:30.021
sold out, well maybe he did 4
great things or she did 4 great
things and then like the other 2

00:36:30.021-->00:36:34.225
things they didn’t end up
passing was, it just was not
politically feasible and it’s

00:36:34.225-->00:36:38.396
really hard to put it into
words, but it’s something to
keep in mind. That there is a

00:36:38.396-->00:36:44.769
limit on how much and what you
can push through a legislature.
Having said that, I just push my

00:36:44.769-->00:36:48.707
political capital to the max, I
try to do everything because
we’re only there for a few

00:36:48.707-->00:36:54.112
months. We’re only alive for 100
years or less, so might as well
just go all in. It results in

00:36:54.112-->00:36:59.417
primary elections, so maybe be
smarter than me if you ever do
this. Partisanship, so I kind of

00:36:59.417-->00:37:04.155
talked about this a little but,
but politicians divide and
conquer the electorate. If you

00:37:04.155-->00:37:09.194
are married to a political
party, uh I completely, I mean I
ran for office so it’s maybe a

00:37:09.194-->00:37:13.431
little bit different, but if
you’re married to one, uh really
question it, question what drove

00:37:13.431-->00:37:17.469
you, question the rhetoric. I
see so many times people jump on
board with one political party

00:37:17.469-->00:37:21.573
because of one issue, they don’t
know much about the other issues
so they just follow and jump on

00:37:21.573-->00:37:26.711
board with it completely. Like I
know social issues really drives
people either side of the aisle.

00:37:26.711-->00:37:31.182
Um we don’t have to go into
detail on the issue, but if
you’re pro-life or pro-choice,

00:37:31.182-->00:37:34.786
you tend to say, these are
really important to me and then
you slip these other issues and

00:37:34.786-->00:37:40.024
say these are my guys on my side
and you know what, we gotta, I
agree with their issues as well,

00:37:40.024-->00:37:43.962
so you have one or two main
issues and people jump on board
the political party and pretty

00:37:43.962-->00:37:47.699
soon they’re married to the
everything the political party
has. And what happens is you

00:37:47.699-->00:37:51.569
lose your independence as an
individual and a voter when it
comes to that and you’re

00:37:51.569-->00:37:55.440
actually playing into a game
where you’re divided and
conquered. Do not lose that

00:37:55.440-->00:38:01.246
independence, that is a that’s
the independent vote is the most
valuable vote. So if I maintain

00:38:01.246-->00:38:07.218
that, you can have a little bit
more influence is what I would
suggest. Let me give a great

00:38:07.218-->00:38:12.223
example of politics. Sorry I’m
just, I’m trying to cover a lot
of information haha. Um,

00:38:16.027-->00:38:19.931
there’s, let me give the best
example. Blue lives matter and
black lives matter. Ok. I’m

00:38:19.931-->00:38:23.535
going to talk about the politics
what one is right or wrong,
that’s not what I’m here to do,

00:38:23.535-->00:38:28.673
I do think it’s a very fun
example that blue lives matter
are the people who support law

00:38:28.673-->00:38:32.310
enforcement, but it’s usually
the right side of the aisle who
hates more government and more

00:38:32.310-->00:38:36.214
laws in their life, yet they
strongly support the guys
enforcing the laws. Well black

00:38:36.214-->00:38:40.985
lives matter is the group that
tends to be more laws, I’m doing
stereotypes, so just work with

00:38:40.985-->00:38:46.991
me, they do um, they want their
views to be more democrat lean,
they want more laws in place,

00:38:46.991-->00:38:51.162
but then they don’t like the
guys who are enforcing the laws
as much so do you see the irony

00:38:51.162-->00:38:55.433
in politics? And no one even
questions it. You got one group
who’s on one side, but they’re

00:38:55.433-->00:38:59.037
really fighting their own ideas.
And you have the other group
who’s on this side and they’re

00:38:59.037-->00:39:05.610
really fighting some of their
own ideas over here. It’s a
crazy concept, so in Montana, we

00:39:05.610-->00:39:10.615
passed most those laws, would
fit under the um the blue li- or
the black lives matter matra of

00:39:13.384-->00:39:17.055
politics of we want more rights
for people to make sure if
they’re arrested they’re

00:39:17.055-->00:39:22.293
following the right procedures,
but instead of jumping on that
like political partisan division

00:39:22.293-->00:39:26.231
path, these were sold as
constitutional bills as well
because they are. They are first

00:39:26.231-->00:39:30.235
amendment, fourth amendment,
mostly fourth amendment pieces
of legislation. That fit the

00:39:30.235-->00:39:36.441
same argument in California of
what the black lives matter
group was doing. The difference

00:39:36.441-->00:39:41.379
is my approach wasn’t saying
this is a co- constitutional
conservative issue, I’m just

00:39:41.379-->00:39:46.884
saying we’re following the
constitution. If we left all the
uh division out of it, so

00:39:46.884-->00:39:50.622
although some of the people on
left would say you know this
really fits what’s going

00:39:50.622-->00:39:55.627
politically, people on the right
were like, these are really good
constitutional bills that are

00:39:55.627-->00:40:00.632
imp- putting into law. If I’m
saying anything it’s don’t jump
on a bandwagon too early because

00:40:03.001-->00:40:08.006
there are reasons why it’s
leading you down that path and
it is not always for um it’s

00:40:10.642-->00:40:15.747
there’s usually some reason
behind it. And just don’t don’t
be blinded by it. Ok. Uh

00:40:15.747-->00:40:21.719
partisan politics invokes
partisan behavior. Here’s a
whole other thing. Tribalism.

00:40:21.719-->00:40:28.126
You are say I’m the republican,
as a democrat they say, he’s a
republican. First off they’re

00:40:28.126-->00:40:34.933
opposing my election so that’s
like we don’t like those guys.
Second off, um, they were they

00:40:34.933-->00:40:39.704
like under they’re for the exact
opposite of of beliefs that I
want. So now it’s like anything

00:40:39.704-->00:40:44.242
that I say I don’t like. Third
off, they’re just these greedy
people and we don’t like them.

00:40:44.242-->00:40:48.746
So they found reasons to dislike
somebody before they even met
them. So but their party helped

00:40:48.746-->00:40:51.482
them raise money, helped them
knock on doors, helped them win
and now they’re all working

00:40:51.482-->00:40:55.853
together on common issues. When
you have this tribalism, where
you hate the other person and

00:40:55.853-->00:41:00.625
you really like your people.
When what you lost was your
ability to question the people

00:41:00.625-->00:41:04.262
internally what they’re going
for and figure out if you have
any common ground across the

00:41:04.262-->00:41:10.902
aisle. Our politics right now is
huge differences where you can’t
even trust and there’s very

00:41:10.902-->00:41:15.039
limited dialogue. Uh my
legislation all passed because I
had people on both sides the

00:41:15.039-->00:41:21.479
aisle jump on board with me um
and say this is good legislation
because I did not adhere to

00:41:21.479-->00:41:27.352
tribalism and follow those
basics rule of this is my team
and I hate that team. If you had

00:41:27.352-->00:41:32.357
that mindset politically this
is, this type of legislation
will never move forward. This

00:41:32.357-->00:41:36.995
legislation can move forward in
the U.S. Senate and Congress at
the Patrick Leahy, Rand Pauls

00:41:36.995-->00:41:42.000
and the Mike Lees and the uh um
Biden out of Oregon. If those
guys really spearheaded it and

00:41:45.103-->00:41:49.574
held back their political
capital together, thing is a lot
of those guys literally hate

00:41:49.574-->00:41:55.646
each other and so it’s hard when
you have a coalition of people
who can agree with the idea but

00:41:55.646-->00:42:02.120
they sometimes can’t get past
personalities and tribalism. And
like I said keep this issue

00:42:02.120-->00:42:09.093
non-partisan. If, do not make it
a one group or another group. If
it’s especially if it’s more of

00:42:09.093-->00:42:14.098
a liberal legislature, then you
know that it follows more with
uh like I said black lives

00:42:14.098-->00:42:18.336
matter concept. If it was more
conservative one, these are
complete conservative issues.

00:42:18.336-->00:42:22.907
You’re not lying to either
group. You’re not, you’re not
like tell him half a story

00:42:22.907-->00:42:26.411
you’re just ta- talking to
somebody how they want to be
spoken to and the way that they

00:42:26.411-->00:42:31.682
can relate to what you’re doing.
Um, the last thing, one of the
last things is forced

00:42:31.682-->00:42:36.854
politicians to listen. So people
think of federal politics as
their everything. But state

00:42:36.854-->00:42:42.126
politics is everything. We make
a lot of rules and we are very
accessible, so you can literally

00:42:42.126-->00:42:46.864
sit down with almost any state
representative or senator. Some
of them are not the nicest

00:42:46.864-->00:42:50.435
people, but a lot of them you
can reach out to, ask their
offices, say I want to meet

00:42:50.435-->00:42:54.038
them, I want to talk to them.
There are 15 minutes, you can
talk about these issues that are

00:42:54.038-->00:42:57.508
important to them. You say these
guys represent me, but most
people don’t ever reach out to

00:42:57.508-->00:43:01.078
them, they don’t even know who
their representatives and
senators are at the state level.

00:43:01.078-->00:43:04.582
So make them represent you.
You’re the constituent, it is
literally your job to figure it

00:43:04.582-->00:43:10.054
out, ask them to hear you. Um,
make this especially more
importantly, make a politician

00:43:10.054-->00:43:13.858
in a tight election earn your
vote. If you say, hey I know
you’re running, I know this is

00:43:13.858-->00:43:18.696
an expensive race, this is
important to me, they are so
likely to placate and give you

00:43:18.696-->00:43:22.667
their support on an issue that’s
not important to them. You can
literally get them on your side,

00:43:22.667-->00:43:28.306
get their support and uh if the
bill comes up, hold them
accountable. You can do that. So

00:43:28.306-->00:43:33.044
a tight election is very
powerful for you. Um, again, be
persistent but do not be

00:43:33.044-->00:43:37.548
offensive. Do not insult these
people, they don’t listen to
you. That doesn’t get you

00:43:37.548-->00:43:42.120
anything, uh it actually makes
you look obnoxious and makes
your issues look obnoxious and

00:43:42.120-->00:43:46.757
makes their support of your
issue for opposing you a lot
easier for them. So be

00:43:46.757-->00:43:52.830
persistent, call, call, call,
just don’t be rude. Um, if they
don’t care, you can always

00:43:52.830-->00:43:57.268
challenge them for office, you
can make it the main issue of
why you’re running. Uh and if

00:43:57.268-->00:44:01.405
they don’t do what you want,
people liked you on Facebook.
It’s their solution, it’s not a

00:44:01.405-->00:44:06.077
solution, and it makes you feel
good, but it’s not the best way
to do it. I would go and use

00:44:06.077-->00:44:10.515
opinion editorials in papers.
Write something. Say this guy,
they wan-, he wants a government

00:44:10.515-->00:44:13.351
going through your e-mails. You
know who wants a government
going through your e-mails and

00:44:13.351-->00:44:17.522
phones. Nobody. Cause
everybody’s got something to
hide again. Unless you’re really

00:44:17.522-->00:44:22.793
boring. Um what you talk about?
So then the last thing is
politicians fear controversy.

00:44:22.793-->00:44:28.299
They hate to be bothered, they
hate to have something. So this
is an easy thing for them to

00:44:28.299-->00:44:32.069
support or they’re never going
to lose a vote or gain a vote
really. So you want to make it

00:44:32.069-->00:44:37.942
so that it’s easy for them to
vote for and not easy for them
to vote against and go hide. Um

00:44:37.942-->00:44:42.013
but it’s very easy for them to
vote for and just be left alone
if you ever pushed any of these

00:44:42.013-->00:44:46.951
types of legislation. Just a
last thing is expecting them to
know better is never reasonable.

00:44:46.951-->00:44:49.453
Because sometimes they just
don’t know about these issues.
It’s not even in their

00:44:49.453-->00:44:54.959
generation. So we can go a
little bit further. I have just
a minute or 2 left, but identify

00:44:54.959-->00:44:59.463
the bill sponsor, you got to
have somebody carry the bill
into legislature, that’s really

00:44:59.463-->00:45:05.002
important to do. Um, and then
organize, you need to just
contract contact the people um

00:45:05.002-->00:45:10.408
contact committee members of
were the bill would go through
and you could get support of

00:45:10.408-->00:45:12.410
this type of legislation. Um
work with groups oh the other
group that was very helpful was

00:45:12.410-->00:45:14.412
the center for de- democracy and
technology with this
legislation. They gave me the

00:45:14.412-->00:45:16.414
original model bills before they
were like in law so that I gotta
kind disrupt. So work with

00:45:16.414-->00:45:21.419
groups, doesn’t matter where
your politics are. Find the
commonality, in the end testify.

00:45:30.895-->00:45:36.067
I worked on legislation, 4
people who didn’t show up to
testify. That’s really annoying.

00:45:36.067-->00:45:41.572
So a please, if you ever do
this, and have somebody working
on this legislation, testify.

00:45:41.572-->00:45:47.245
This is the last slide of why
you matter. And this is a little
bit different than everything

00:45:47.245-->00:45:51.015
else we’ve talked about.
Regarding technology, if
technology is used

00:45:51.015-->00:45:57.722
inappropriately, it could really
ruin our republic and uh it
could put a lot of fear into

00:45:57.722-->00:46:04.061
people so I think this law, or
this quote is proper. When law
and morality contradict each

00:46:04.061-->00:46:08.265
other, the citizen has the cruel
alternative of either losing his
moral sense or losing his

00:46:08.265-->00:46:14.605
respect for the law. So in other
words, if you’re going to follow
a bad law, you might use lose

00:46:14.605-->00:46:21.479
your morality. But if you refuse
to follow that law, uh, you lose
respect for the law, but you

00:46:21.479-->00:46:26.817
know, you might actually be some
of the most important people if
if the worse case scenario comes

00:46:26.817-->00:46:31.822
into fruition. So with that,
thank you for having me and I
appreciate having this

00:46:36.994-->00:46:40.765
opportunity. [applause]
