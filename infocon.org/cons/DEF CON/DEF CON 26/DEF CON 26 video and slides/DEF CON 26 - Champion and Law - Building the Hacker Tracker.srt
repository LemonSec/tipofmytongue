00:00:00.434-->00:00:06.807
>>alright, so right off the bat
I just want to say that I’m
disappointed that my like talks

00:00:06.807-->00:00:11.345
on security unit testing just
don’t get this many
people,right, that’s probably

00:00:11.345-->00:00:14.081
more important so we’re just
gonna switch it up and that’s
what we’re gonna talk about

00:00:14.081-->00:00:19.686
instead [laughter]. Okay,
alright, alright we’ll talk
about the hacker tracker, ummm

00:00:19.686-->00:00:23.724
so right off the bat I’m Seth
Law I’m an application security
consultant, I’ve done

00:00:23.724-->00:00:28.495
development in the past, uh, I
actually started my career at
IOmega, uh anybody here remember

00:00:28.495-->00:00:34.501
the Zip drive? >>yeah >>Yeah? K,
I was not responsible for the
click of death, that was not me,

00:00:34.501-->00:00:39.540
blame the hardware engineers
right, if you lost data that was
not my fault. That dates me,

00:00:39.540-->00:00:44.544
I’ve been around for a long
time. I’ve been coming to DefCon
since Defcon eight, or something

00:00:44.544-->00:00:50.050
like that, um but now I just do
application security work, I’m
an independent consultant. So,

00:00:50.050-->00:00:53.954
that’s me, I do the ios version,
um, I’m gonna turn it over to
Whitney really quick. >>I’m

00:00:53.954-->00:01:00.060
short, how does this work? Um,
Hi everyone, I’m Whitney
Champion, shortxstack, um I’ve

00:01:00.060-->00:01:05.065
been doing the android version
of hacker tracker since 2012,
uh, so I um am a systems

00:01:07.568-->00:01:12.572
engineer out of South Carolina.
Android is a hobby for me,
that’s why this guy is here now

00:01:15.475-->00:01:22.416
(chuckle) um, but yeah thank you
guys for coming. >>Hey guys, I’m
Chris, uh also known as advice

00:01:22.416-->00:01:28.755
dog. Ummm, I met Whitney at
DefCon 24 and started talking to
her about hacker tracker because

00:01:28.755-->00:01:33.427
I liked using it but was like
I-I feel like it could be better
right? Um, and it was open

00:01:33.427-->00:01:36.830
source so I was really excited
I’m like oh I can totally commit
to this you know I can change

00:01:36.830-->00:01:42.569
things, um and I started talking
to her and she was totally cool
with me changing things so I

00:01:42.569-->00:01:46.340
joined the team, started work
things and I took over def uh,
the android version for uh

00:01:46.340-->00:01:53.113
hacker tracker eh, for 25 and
26, so the current version,
yeah. Uh I’ve done a tone of

00:01:53.113-->00:01:57.184
rewrites. Pretty much its uh
whenever I’m board, I guess I
just look at hacker tracker and

00:01:57.184-->00:02:02.456
I’m like ‘how could it be
better?’ Um, so any performance
you enjoy, I spent way too much

00:02:02.456-->00:02:07.594
time on haha [laughter] >>Yes,
th-that is a running theme as we
spend too much time on it. I’ve

00:02:07.594-->00:02:11.832
got my family here, they know,
like the last couple of weeks
especially, every spare moment

00:02:11.832-->00:02:15.936
of my time has been alright can
I get this in so I can get it in
to the app store so we can

00:02:15.936-->00:02:20.340
actually get it into the ios
version. Um, so the first thing
we’re going to talk about is

00:02:20.340-->00:02:26.480
where it came from, I joined the
hacker tracker team or the IOS
version was uh started in about

00:02:26.480-->00:02:31.084
2014, I think it was, something
like that right? So, it was a
couple of years after Whitney

00:02:31.084-->00:02:35.455
did the first one, so we’ll let
her talk about what she came up
with and then we’ll move onto

00:02:35.455-->00:02:40.660
you know when ios came and you
know how we’ve done things.
Alright so what happened was-

00:02:40.660-->00:02:47.000
>>hehe what had happened was um,
so I wasn’t able to go to DefCon
in 2012, um I’ve been coming

00:02:47.000-->00:02:52.873
since 2009, and I was really
bummed that I couldn’t be there
that year, sooo I wanted to give

00:02:52.873-->00:02:58.178
back in someway so I wanted to
contribute um, I was pregnant
and couldn’t leave, so I spent

00:02:58.178-->00:03:01.581
probably 2 months pretty much
pouring my heart into the f-what
was the first version of

00:03:01.581-->00:03:07.254
Android, which is what you see
here, which is- don’t knock the
awesome photoshop skills, I

00:03:07.254-->00:03:13.894
know, it’s just mind blowing,
but,that if, if you came the
first uh first version was like

00:03:13.894-->00:03:19.800
2012, 2013 and that is what it
looked like, um it’s just
beautiful. Um, so that was the

00:03:19.800-->00:03:25.572
first 4 years and like Seth
said, he joined a couple of
years later and did the ios

00:03:25.572-->00:03:29.876
version. >>The ios version,
you’ll notice that the you know
all the, the margins are off and

00:03:29.876-->00:03:34.581
things like that, we had a lot
to learn about how to actually
put this together, um again you

00:03:34.581-->00:03:40.087
know awesome photoshop skills.
As you can see, nowadays we’ve
got actual designers that work

00:03:40.087-->00:03:45.425
with us a little bit, uh we’ll
get into that um, a bit later,
but the first ios version, I

00:03:45.425-->00:03:50.030
think the version that made it
through the app store that most
of the attendees downloaded

00:03:50.030-->00:03:54.501
actually crashed for the first
two days of the conference right
it was not necessarily in my

00:03:54.501-->00:03:58.305
case a successful effort. I
remember being pretty
disappointed that I couldn’t

00:03:58.305-->00:04:03.443
push through the version that I
wanted people to have. Um, and
that's, traditionally that’s

00:04:03.443-->00:04:08.014
what happens to us, we-we have
these ideas, Chris pushes
something, we talk about it, we

00:04:08.014-->00:04:13.553
put it into the app and then
whether or not it actually makes
it out to you is another story.

00:04:13.553-->00:04:17.257
Um, that being said, we’ve had a
lot of great feedback. So, we’ll
step into some of that here,

00:04:17.257-->00:04:22.696
here in a f- um here in a
minute. Now, it’s official
right? This makes us happy, uh

00:04:22.696-->00:04:29.136
DefCon actually brought us on
board, uh when was that >>It was
right after you joined >>20, so

00:04:29.136-->00:04:35.275
it was what 2015 2016, yeah.
2016 I think it was the first
year that hacker tracker was the

00:04:35.275-->00:04:40.981
official app of DefCon. Um, And
now, actually uh, Chris and I
are members of the info booth

00:04:40.981-->00:04:46.353
team, uh so we are related to
the guys that you’re seeing
sitting around in the booths

00:04:46.353-->00:04:51.258
telling you about maps and other
things. We’re working with them
closely, uh mellows helped us

00:04:51.258-->00:04:57.664
out, uh immensely to actually
get events and get them into the
application um, but we are the

00:04:57.664-->00:05:01.401
official application for DefCon,
obviously, that’s why we’re
here, that’s why the promote it

00:05:01.401-->00:05:05.906
at each of those info booths,
it’s so that you have this
information at the palm of your

00:05:05.906-->00:05:10.010
hands. I mean part of the reason
that I wanted to do it initially
was the fact that I-I had the

00:05:10.010-->00:05:14.648
booklet and it just wasn’t
tenable, I had my phone with me
as well and I got involved

00:05:14.648-->00:05:19.486
because I wanted to be able to
track all of these different
events and actually do

00:05:19.486-->00:05:23.657
something. I saw that Whitney
had the android version and
thought yeah we can do that on

00:05:23.657-->00:05:30.263
ios as well. Pain points, now
there are a lot of pain points.
Um, first off is scheduling, you

00:05:30.263-->00:05:36.536
wanna talk about this? >>Yeah,
so, scheduling for the first
like 3 what, well actually until

00:05:36.536-->00:05:41.541
this year when, so Seth’ll uh
get into his part of this after
I talk about how difficult hand

00:05:44.044-->00:05:50.150
jamming thousands of lines of
json was for the first several
years. Um, it was mind numbing

00:05:50.150-->00:05:55.889
haha the other part was all the
villages, all the um like
contest, all the events all the

00:05:55.889-->00:06:01.161
talks, everything was in a
different format so there was no
like easy way to go scrape every

00:06:01.161-->00:06:07.200
website, there was no easy way
to get all the data, it was very
much a manual process. So, I

00:06:07.200-->00:06:12.806
don’t know how many hundreds of
hours we spent staring at these
files, but my God I’m glad that

00:06:12.806-->00:06:16.977
those days are over. Um,
especially this year there’s
what like 28 villages, something

00:06:16.977-->00:06:21.982
like that and every single one
has a different format, so
hopefully that will ease up um

00:06:24.718-->00:06:29.723
going forward. >>So, if, yeah,
if you-if you’ve never
handwritten json files and made

00:06:32.025-->00:06:37.097
sure that the modified date is
changed at 2 am, you just
haven’t experienced joy, right?

00:06:37.097-->00:06:41.568
>>right >>that’s i-it’s really
easy to do and really easy to
mess up, and then the

00:06:41.568-->00:06:46.806
application crashes. Or if your
dealing with the ios you know
json parser and happen to have

00:06:46.806-->00:06:52.612
an errant you know uh, new line
character inside of a string,
you wanna know what happens to

00:06:52.612-->00:06:57.651
ios? Yeah, it crashes right, so
there’s all of these pain points
that we’ve dealt with with the

00:06:57.651-->00:07:02.656
schedule. Uh, now the-the next
one is you know, don’t trust the
hackers. Um, the first well, I

00:07:02.656-->00:07:04.658
mean as soon as I got involved
we started advertising out on
twitter hey guess what we’ve got

00:07:04.658-->00:07:06.660
this app that we built for
DefCon, how many people do you
actually think downloaded the

00:07:06.660-->00:07:09.496
app that first year, guesses?
Five? There’s some trusting
people, there’s more trusting

00:07:09.496-->00:07:14.501
people out there than that. But,
our-our biggest response on
twitter was exactly this, “No,

00:07:24.678-->00:07:28.548
no, no there’s no way I’m
downloading that”- >>yeah
>>right? You know. “You guys are

00:07:28.548-->00:07:32.519
shady” >>It doesn’t matter that
the source code was all out
there they were like “Who are

00:07:32.519-->00:07:36.456
you nerds putting out this app?”
Especially for the android
version cause you know th-that’s

00:07:36.456-->00:07:40.860
just kind of a free for all but
they’re like “there’s rootkits
don’t do it, they’re gonna take

00:07:40.860-->00:07:45.565
your data they’re gonna steal
your pictures, don’t install any
of it” so- >>So the answer is

00:07:45.565-->00:07:50.003
yes we have all your data
>>right >>Let’s just get that
out of the way we’ll move on

00:07:50.003-->00:07:56.309
>>You weren’t supposed to say
that >>sorry, uhhhh. Okay the
other thing is bug fixes at all

00:07:56.309-->00:08:02.549
hours. Um, how many people here
are like uh ios developers that
push things into the app store?

00:08:02.549-->00:08:07.554
We’ve got a couple of you >>7
>>I feel your pain, um how easy
is it to actually push bug fixes

00:08:11.825-->00:08:17.297
into the app store quickly?
Easy? No, it’s very difficult
right? Um, and we’ll get into

00:08:17.297-->00:08:23.169
this in a little bit but you
know this was realistically our
lives over especially the month

00:08:23.169-->00:08:28.775
before DefCon,okay, is the bug
fixes and when it actually has
to happen. >>See, I had the

00:08:28.775-->00:08:33.346
luxury of being able to blast
anything to production at 3
o’clock in the morning after 6

00:08:33.346-->00:08:38.385
shots and who knows what’s gonna
happen so, that was-that was the
toss up between android and

00:08:38.385-->00:08:43.390
apple for us. >>yeah >>Seth had
a little more uh, validation on
his end. >>I did, and it’s about

00:08:45.458-->00:08:50.897
finding time, I mean obviously
we’ve got normal jobs right? I
guess, kind of normal jobs.

00:08:50.897-->00:08:55.502
“Normal jobs”, um and so
actually finding the time to put
this together, it’s not

00:08:55.502-->00:08:59.939
necessarily something that just
happens in one afternoon as much
as we would like to think we’re

00:08:59.939-->00:09:05.045
great developers, there’s always
bugs, there’s always things that
uh, that- >>This doesn’t happen

00:09:05.045-->00:09:08.748
in the afternoon >>No, it just
doesn’t happen in an afternoon,
it happens, at 3 AM when you

00:09:08.748-->00:09:14.020
push directly to master, that’s
when it happens. >>after the
kids go to sleep >>Yeah,

00:09:14.020-->00:09:19.025
alright, waiting on redacted.
Anybody seen like the-the mobile
operating system? In the ios

00:09:22.529-->00:09:27.534
version? Yes, why do you think
that is? Okay, this is the app
review process. K, we get random

00:09:31.371-->00:09:35.642
people that are looking at the
application and I have marked
the app it was explicit,but you

00:09:35.642-->00:09:42.015
wanna know what uh okay, so, so
it’s okay for in the app for us
to say D**n and H**l and SH**

00:09:42.015-->00:09:46.853
and everything else, but you
know what I can’t say?
Jailbreak. I can’t say that,

00:09:46.853-->00:09:51.858
that’s not okay. Um, so last
year especially this became a
huge issue, I’ve had i-it’s-I

00:09:55.195-->00:09:59.332
I’ve had, I just got rejected
you know 3 days ago again you
know on the latest version that

00:09:59.332-->00:10:04.337
I wanted you guys to have in
your hand for ios. Because it
says hack and it says uh you

00:10:06.439-->00:10:10.343
know there’s other things that
are in there that whoever it is
that’s in the app review process

00:10:10.343-->00:10:14.514
looking at the application
actually thinks its hey you’re
promoting hacking, there’s like

00:10:14.514-->00:10:20.053
the whole apple terms of service
and like we’re doing our best is
realistically what it is and

00:10:20.053-->00:10:23.823
we’re coming up with ways to
actually get around this. So,
the redacted in their that

00:10:23.823-->00:10:29.262
you’re seeing is because we,
yeah we’ve just learned if we do
that, if we take out the term

00:10:29.262-->00:10:35.435
watchos, or take out the term
macos that they accept it. Uh,
but if we don’t and it happens

00:10:35.435-->00:10:41.407
to be in somebody’s talk, they
won’t right. So,I feel really
bad for the speakers whose title

00:10:41.407-->00:10:46.913
of their talk is breaking macos
or something like that cause
it’s you know redacteding

00:10:46.913-->00:10:51.918
redacted os. [laughter] sorry,
that’s-that’s all I can do I um
we’re doing our best. Okay so

00:10:54.587-->00:10:59.225
last year we did a big overhaul
um and even this year you’ll
notice it’s a lot different than

00:10:59.225-->00:11:03.930
those images that we put up
there first. I’ll let uh Chris
talk to the android version

00:11:03.930-->00:11:08.935
first. >> uh, sure so DefCon 25
was the first version that I
came onto it. So, I did a ton of

00:11:12.205-->00:11:17.010
different changes and all that
stuff, so, pretty much from the
ground up I rebuilt the app um

00:11:17.010-->00:11:22.348
probably multiple times over the
year just cause I’ve got a lot
of free time. Um but like a lot

00:11:22.348-->00:11:28.521
of the focus is just trying to
figure out exactly how we can
make a, like a hacker conference

00:11:28.521-->00:11:33.026
good in terms of schedule. Cause
we don’t really know-there’s
guidelines I guess out there of

00:11:33.026-->00:11:36.663
what we could do and what we
can’t do, but we’re trying to
figure out exactly what kind of

00:11:36.663-->00:11:41.167
information you need and like
what you want and everything
like that, so we’re also trying

00:11:41.167-->00:11:47.407
to do a lot of stuff. It’s like
everything from the ground up,
rebuild it and make it

00:11:47.407-->00:11:52.712
impressive you know from like,
and like I’ve rebuilt it
multiple times also for DefCon

00:11:52.712-->00:11:58.151
26. Um, for like las- example,
for last year uh hacker tracker
on android was what 19

00:11:58.151-->00:12:03.556
megabytes, this year it’s about
4 point 2. Uh, it is insanely
small, it should be the fastest,

00:12:03.556-->00:12:08.761
smallest app on your phone,
hopefully, uh and that’s pretty
much what I’ve been doing is

00:12:08.761-->00:12:14.300
just trying to make the best app
for you guys you know? Cause I
found if I hate it, then you’re

00:12:14.300-->00:12:18.004
probably going to hate it, you
know, if it bugs me, it might
bug you, but it’ll probably bug

00:12:18.004-->00:12:23.710
you eventually. >>yeah so the
whole idea is that we want it to
bug you right? Like I-I I even

00:12:23.710-->00:12:29.082
just saw a bug pop up on my
phone on the reminders for ios
that’s yeah, um but last year we

00:12:29.082-->00:12:34.487
did a pretty extensive overhaul
of ios as well, um, we’ve got
the animations that are in there

00:12:34.487-->00:12:39.025
if you seen like the little
jitter as it starts up, that’s
us stealing, I mean that’s us

00:12:39.025-->00:12:43.696
just animating the initial
screen that your on [laughter]
right there it’s not sending

00:12:43.696-->00:12:50.169
data anywhere right um, but
along those lines we’ve upgraded
right, we don’t support ios 9

00:12:50.169-->00:12:54.807
anymore like I may try and push
a version out there, especially
for those of you that have

00:12:54.807-->00:13:00.013
burner phones that have decided
that we’re all going to hack you
because you’re here. Um, yeah,

00:13:00.013-->00:13:05.018
so we may support that in the
future, I’ll do some downgrades
to make sure we can actually

00:13:07.153-->00:13:12.925
support some of those older
versions of ios, uh but that is
kind of a forward looking thing.

00:13:12.925-->00:13:17.263
When I tried to compile it
initially I got a whole bunch of
error messages for ios 9 and so

00:13:17.263-->00:13:21.567
I scrapped it right, there’s
only so much time in the day.
Um, the other thing that we did

00:13:21.567-->00:13:27.306
last year was the ui redesign we
actually engaged with a graphic
designer um, Chris Mays who may

00:13:27.306-->00:13:33.980
be here somewhere in the room?
Chris are you here? Alright, I
don’t see him. Chris uh actually

00:13:33.980-->00:13:39.218
uh worked for a company last
year and their graphic designer
was willing to chip in um and

00:13:39.218-->00:13:43.089
help us actually do some of the
ui designs so a lot of the
elements that make it look a

00:13:43.089-->00:13:48.995
little bit more polished came
from her, uh that was Megan,
she’s listed in the ios app um

00:13:48.995-->00:13:53.933
and it has made things more
streamlined, it’s made it so
it’s easier to actually use and

00:13:53.933-->00:13:58.604
navigate. The one thing that we
did away with this year was the
uh, tab bar down at the bottom,

00:13:58.604-->00:14:04.577
for ios, we moved to the menu so
that we’re trying to get more of
a unified look and feel. Um, the

00:14:04.577-->00:14:08.881
other thing is we do support
multiple conferences. Has
anybody used hacker tracker at a

00:14:08.881-->00:14:15.354
different conference? No? Oh we
got a couple, ok, yeah, it their
nowhere near as big as DefCon,

00:14:15.354-->00:14:20.393
DefCon is definitely our primary
conference, uh but we support uh
ShoCon, TourCon, we did

00:14:20.393-->00:14:26.632
HackWest, we did a couple bsides
events during the year. If you
would like to use hacker tracker

00:14:26.632-->00:14:31.804
at other conferences, just hit
us up on twitter it’s not
difficult we’ve structured the

00:14:31.804-->00:14:38.010
app so that we can load
different conferences in there
and make it easier to use and a

00:14:38.010-->00:14:42.782
community resource. The whole
idea is the codes out there, it
can be reused these other

00:14:42.782-->00:14:46.919
conferences could compile it but
we have the ability to actually
switch and use it within the

00:14:46.919-->00:14:51.924
same interface, okay. Alright,
so high points- >>So, I think
one of the most fun parts over

00:14:54.527-->00:15:00.366
the last few years um, that
we’ve had is hiding Easter eggs
in the app, so uh, several

00:15:00.366-->00:15:05.037
people have come to me to hide
things for different contests um
specifically the DC darknet

00:15:05.037-->00:15:11.310
challenge, that’s been one of my
favorites because we’ve done
that probably 3-3 years now. One

00:15:11.310-->00:15:15.882
year I hid a password in the app
and a bunch of you came to me to
get the most ridiculously dumb

00:15:15.882-->00:15:19.185
unicorn sticker and I don’t know
why any of you took the time to
come find it because it’s

00:15:19.185-->00:15:25.758
horrible, but there it is. Um,
Seth uh, went to the trouble of
making stickers and hiding

00:15:25.758-->00:15:30.763
things in the ios version as
well, so it’s, it’s been a lot
of fun to like engage everybody

00:15:30.763-->00:15:36.869
and try to do whatever we can to
get other contests and events
involved. This has been

00:15:36.869-->00:15:41.874
especially interesting, um we’ve
gotten good attendee feedback,
we’ve gotten bad attendee

00:15:45.912-->00:15:51.217
feedback, and we’ve gotten weird
attendee feedback. But the good
attendee feedback has been by

00:15:51.217-->00:15:55.955
and large the best. Um,
especially since Chris joined
and then put in a lot of work,

00:15:55.955-->00:16:01.460
um I don’t have nearly as much
anymore to-to contribute so he’s
done a huge uh, it’s been a huge

00:16:01.460-->00:16:07.133
effort on his part um to make it
as awesome as possible for you
guys on his end and so with

00:16:07.133-->00:16:12.505
Seth, so the reviews that you
guys have given us are just
amazing and especially like the

00:16:12.505-->00:16:17.143
ideas you’ve come back with,
like feature request, bug fixes,
bug reports, like all of that

00:16:17.143-->00:16:21.881
stuff has been amazing. So just
like keep sending that because
it helps us and it helps us make

00:16:21.881-->00:16:26.886
it better. >>yeah just one thing
okay if you if you review us 4
stars and say some schedule

00:16:30.656-->00:16:35.962
items are wrong just hit us on
twitter please [laughter] don’t
don’t ruin our rating, we’re

00:16:35.962-->00:16:40.566
trying, you know hit us up on
twitter we’ll fix it immediately
>>scheduling is hard

00:16:40.566-->00:16:44.904
>>[indiscernible] eventually.
Cause all the negative feedback,
I get an email, I read it, I get

00:16:44.904-->00:16:48.374
depressed, it’s not great.
[laughter] people might feel
like it is but it’s >>don’t make

00:16:48.374-->00:16:50.977
Chris cry >>don’t make Chris cry
[laughter] >>This is probably my
favorite email I’ve gotten so

00:16:50.977-->00:16:54.013
far. Um, there’ve been a lot of
worse ones but this is
definitely the-the best “My

00:16:54.013-->00:16:59.018
email has been hacked. When I
reply to certain people it tells
me that it came back unreadable

00:17:07.493-->00:17:13.866
with crazy text covering up my
info.” But bottom line, the last
part is the best, “If it does,

00:17:13.866-->00:17:18.871
will it report the hacker to the
police?” [laughter] Nooo
[laughter] umm it will not, I

00:17:24.744-->00:17:29.749
never heard back from this guy,
um, I also did not respond.
[laughter] So, ha, so I mean I

00:17:33.853-->00:17:40.192
thought about it but he says
I’ve been having issues with
cyber stalking so I a- I decided

00:17:40.192-->00:17:45.197
to avoid that. >> yeah so, uh
like we were saying last year
uh, Chris took over the android

00:17:51.270-->00:17:58.010
version, Chris Mays has helped
me immensely on the ios version
he’s like a full time ios

00:17:58.010-->00:18:02.949
developer he’s on he’s in the
app if you if you see his name
you know click on it give him

00:18:02.949-->00:18:08.454
kudos as well because he’s been
a huge help in actually
debugging and making sure that

00:18:08.454-->00:18:13.526
the app runs expectedly it
doesn’t crash. Um, you know a
lot of good just kind of overall

00:18:13.526-->00:18:18.664
design patterns and things like
that have come from his brain.
Um, I was hoping he was here so

00:18:18.664-->00:18:23.069
we could you know recognize him
a little bit but that’s fine.
But otherwise, right, just

00:18:23.069-->00:18:27.707
getting feedback from you has
been the best thing. If you use
the app and there’s something

00:18:27.707-->00:18:32.278
that bugs you like Chris said,
let us know, tell us about it.
If you haven’t downloaded the

00:18:32.278-->00:18:36.649
app go download the app and use
it. Make sure and update the
events because it is being

00:18:36.649-->00:18:43.255
updated every yeah, pull-pull to
pull down to update because
that’ll actually get you the

00:18:43.255-->00:18:49.328
latest results and the latest uh
events that are going on and
what’s going on right now. Um,

00:18:49.328-->00:18:53.599
but let us know if those are
wrong, and also if there’s
something in the app that is an

00:18:53.599-->00:18:59.605
issue. Especially if the app
crashes. So we’ve got a whole
bunch of lessons learned, right?

00:18:59.605-->00:19:06.078
Um, first of all haters gonna
hate. >>Yeah, so some of you are
mean.[laughter] just saying ha.

00:19:06.078-->00:19:12.551
Um, the first couple of years or
the first 4 years um, at least
from my end was soloing this

00:19:12.551-->00:19:18.958
which means like a lot of late
nights staring at this and then
I’d get on the reviews page and

00:19:18.958-->00:19:24.497
I’m like holy S**t, you people
can be evil but we already know
this cause we’re on twitter

00:19:24.497-->00:19:28.667
we’ve seen the worst of the
internet but, um, uh, I think it
definitely garnishes some thick

00:19:28.667-->00:19:34.040
skin over the years. Um, so yeah
the 3 of us have poured a lot
into this and we’ve realized

00:19:34.040-->00:19:39.945
that you can’t please everybody,
so the best we can do is just
try to make it as good as we can

00:19:39.945-->00:19:46.552
for all of you guys, but I will
say it has been highly
entertaining reading some of the

00:19:46.552-->00:19:51.557
stuff that we’ve gotten over the
past what 6 years. Yeah, I don’t
know what you’ve got on your

00:19:53.793-->00:19:57.363
end. >>Oh, all the ios
developers, they’re totally
trustworthy and nice. [laughter]

00:19:57.363-->00:20:04.370
um, the other thing we’ve
learned is like taking feedback
right? Obviously twitter is a

00:20:04.370-->00:20:10.309
great way to do this, um you can
hit us up that’s why our handles
are there in the applications,

00:20:10.309-->00:20:14.413
but aside from that if you hit
us up on github that’s where
we’re actually tracking the

00:20:14.413-->00:20:21.487
code, uh you put in a pole
request or you put in an issue
uh we will track it in there and

00:20:21.153-->00:20:24.924
close it out so that you know
that that we’ve looked at it and
we’ve done something with it

00:20:24.924-->00:20:32.398
right? >>Yep. >>um we do have to
wait >>you have to wait >>I have
to wait, I have to wait. Like I

00:20:32.398-->00:20:37.536
said there’s a version that’s
out there that’s hopefully going
to be released soon, uh I get

00:20:37.536-->00:20:43.409
denied on expedite requests um
I’m waiting on jailbreaks,
whatever. Right um, you know the

00:20:43.409-->00:20:48.981
other thing I was thinking was
that we could push it to like
cydia,uh the you know the

00:20:48.981-->00:20:56.589
jailbreak store. Uh is anybody
here using a jailbroken device?
Even as a burner? So, I mean if

00:20:56.589-->00:20:59.892
there’s enough of you that are
doing it then I’ll look into it
and we’ll push it that

00:20:59.892-->00:21:04.130
direction. Because, it would be
a lot easier for me to be, to
push in there for soric then it

00:21:04.130-->00:21:09.635
is to actually push into the app
store.I Just I’m not sure if
apple is going to be too happy

00:21:09.635-->00:21:16.575
about that, you never know.
Backup plans, you have to have
backup plans right? >>I think,

00:21:16.575-->00:21:23.382
we’ve kinda learned that we
don’t have a solid back up plan
yet. [laughter] Um, so, we’ve we

00:21:23.382-->00:21:30.656
tried various different ways of
scheduling and this actually
ties into what you built over

00:21:30.656-->00:21:36.028
the last I don’t know however
long you’ve been working on the
uh on your event manager so uh

00:21:36.028-->00:21:41.433
we’ve tried pulling from the
info booth, we’ve tried static
json so we’ve kinda tried to

00:21:41.433-->00:21:48.240
combine the two of those and
have some like main dashboard
for um loading all of the events

00:21:48.240-->00:21:54.547
in because it’s just gotten so
big and so many villages and so
many pieces of this we’ve we’ve

00:21:54.547-->00:21:58.817
gotta streamline it somewhere.
>>Yeah, guesses on how many
events we have in the hacker in

00:21:58.817-->00:22:05.457
hacker tracker this year? [all
of them] all of them ha I wish
but I don’t think we’ve gotten

00:22:05.457-->00:22:11.096
there. >>probably not >>how many
did you say? >>150 >>ok keep
going up >>250 >>keep going up

00:22:11.096-->00:22:18.604
>>500 >>keep going up >>1-->000
>>close, just under 1-->000
probably around 800 right now

00:22:18.604-->00:22:22.608
that you can actually do and
that’s between parties, events
and all the different talks,

00:22:22.608-->00:22:29.415
contests. Um yeah especially the
villages we’re at 25 plus
villages this year. And each

00:22:29.415-->00:22:33.886
village is basically it’s own
conference. Some of those
villages the con, like the

00:22:33.886-->00:22:39.258
content that is there is bigger
than the other conferences that
we’ve been talking about. Uh, so

00:22:39.258-->00:22:43.796
you know we’re trying to give
you ways to actually filter
things and actually you know do

00:22:43.796-->00:22:47.499
searches, that’s where you're
going to have to become familiar
with to actually get that data

00:22:47.499-->00:22:54.039
back. Okay so going forward,
first of all we-we want it to be
more streamlined, the whole

00:22:54.039-->00:22:59.712
process from the feedback to you
to us actually getting the
features out. Um the ios android

00:22:59.712-->00:23:04.550
parody, to make sure they look
somewhat similar so that the
experience on both is the same.

00:23:04.550-->00:23:09.622
Now that is difficult based on
the design patterns from android
or from google versus the design

00:23:09.622-->00:23:14.393
patterns from apple. Um, but
there’s a lot of different apps
that do this we’re gonna, we’re

00:23:14.393-->00:23:19.098
kind of creating our own look
and feel and we will be
maintaining that parody to some

00:23:19.098-->00:23:25.904
extent right. Um, you guys want
to say anything else? The
scheduling application, like

00:23:25.904-->00:23:31.343
Whitney said, we built a back
end to hacker tracker um and if
you can find it and insert an

00:23:31.343-->00:23:37.750
event, kudos to you right? Um,
that’s a- that would be a
challenge but most likely you

00:23:37.750-->00:23:43.889
won’t be able to figure out
where it’s at so it’s fine. Um,
it’s fine don’t worry about it

00:23:43.889-->00:23:49.194
>>You just challenged the real
hackers >>I know I did, that was
stupid [laughter] um, I have

00:23:49.194-->00:23:54.199
been here for too long. Yeah, so
the scheduling application is
going to make this a lot easier,

00:23:54.199-->00:23:58.437
we are coordinating like I said
with the info booth uh next year
we’re probably going to take

00:23:58.437-->00:24:03.275
over infodotdefcondotorg right
um, and so we’re hoping that
we’ll be able to bring that into

00:24:03.275-->00:24:08.080
parody with what the app looks
like, it just depends on the
time. If you are interested and

00:24:08.080-->00:24:12.685
have development skills and want
to jump in and help us out, let
us know, we’re always looking

00:24:12.685-->00:24:17.856
for more people to help. I mean
how many hours did you spend
inputting- >>Yeah, if anybody

00:24:17.856-->00:24:29.134
likes data entry [laughter] join
us. >>We need a mindless
factotum. >>Yes >>Who's out

00:24:29.134-->00:24:35.274
there? You can’t leave until we
find one, come on. Um, more
conferences, like I said before,

00:24:35.274-->00:24:40.779
if you’re attending a conference
and they don’t have a scheduling
application, let us know we’d be

00:24:40.779-->00:24:45.651
happy to add that data to hacker
tracker to the back end and
actually push that out so that

00:24:45.651-->00:24:50.222
it becomes more useful.
Realistically we want this as
the go to for not just DefCon

00:24:50.222-->00:24:54.727
but for the community for the
wider security community or uh,
development community for that

00:24:54.727-->00:25:01.133
matter. How many people have
used an a- did use the black hat
app this year? How awesome was

00:25:01.133-->00:25:10.342
that? Yes that was great, yeah,
No, okay. Well that that's all
I’ll say on that. Feedback is

00:25:10.342-->00:25:19.351
always welcome. Did you want to
say something? >>no, um so as
always like Seth said, feedback

00:25:19.351-->00:25:25.391
is always welcome hit us up on
Github, hit us up on Twitter. If
you want to contribute, do so,

00:25:25.391-->00:25:31.630
it’s all open source, it’s all
out there um, the three of us
are responsive pretty much all

00:25:31.630-->00:25:37.403
of the time. So, if you want to
contribute please do we would
love to have you and we would

00:25:37.403-->00:25:45.677
love the help. Yeah >>Ok, it’s
open source, but please don’t be
too critical we’re on a time

00:25:45.677-->00:25:50.916
crunch, things are messy we’ll
fix it up later, next year, next
will be better. Haha. [laughter]

00:25:50.916-->00:25:58.157
>>Any Questions? I think we only
have a couple of minutes before
the Defcon 101 Panels coming in

00:25:58.157-->00:26:03.262
here. Yeah? >>How often does it
refresh its data? >>whenever you
pull >>yeah uh on ios whatever

00:26:03.262-->00:26:09.168
you pull on android there is a
>>should be 7 days could be 15
minutes I don’t know it’s mainly

00:26:09.168-->00:26:15.107
how android handles work
manager, I specify 7 days but
it’ll kinda hopefully if you’re

00:26:15.107-->00:26:21.380
on wifi it’s like oh I’ll do it
now or whatever. >>but you can
also do it manually, so >>yes

00:26:21.380-->00:26:26.985
>>we’re we’re throwing in
updates like this whole week
it’s been pretty much hourly

00:26:26.985-->00:26:31.156
that we’ve been adding events so
just refresh >>just swipe down,
when you go to that first event

00:26:31.156-->00:26:35.294
screen just swipe down let it
refresh cause there’s other
stuff that's being added and

00:26:35.294-->00:26:39.364
those dates change. We’re
getting told that we need to
leave the stage. So we’ve got 10

00:26:39.364-->00:26:44.036
more questions before we’ll
leave [laughter]. No, no wait I
need the mindless factotum

00:26:44.036-->00:26:49.741
first. Alright, well thank you
for using the application,
follow us on twitter leave us

00:26:49.741-->00:26:54.079
feedback and I hope it’s useful,
that was the whole reason that
we built it is we wanted

00:26:54.079-->00:26:59.618
something. So it works for us
but if it doesn’t work for you
it’s not as cool. So um, yeah

00:26:59.618-->00:00:00.000
download, download us, download
it and let us know what you
think. Okay [applause]
