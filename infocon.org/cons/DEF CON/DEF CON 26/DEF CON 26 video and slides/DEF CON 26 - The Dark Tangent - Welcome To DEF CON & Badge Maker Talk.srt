00:00:00.133-->00:00:05.138
>>Alright, let me take off this
ten pound backpack full of gold,
and welcome you to DefCon,

00:00:09.042-->00:00:14.047
“Hello DefCon!” [applause] woo!
So we’re gonna kinda splits this
up between two things, I want to

00:00:16.850-->00:00:22.089
talk a little bit about Defcon
and then we’re going to uh
introduce the TYMKRS and talk

00:00:22.089-->00:00:26.793
about their badge creation this
year and then if we have a
little time left I’d love to do

00:00:26.793-->00:00:32.533
some questions from the
audience. So. That’s the plan.
See if it works out that way.

00:00:32.533-->00:00:37.537
Um. Okay I wanna see by a show
of hands, how many people are
here for the very first time?

00:00:40.641-->00:00:45.946
Well I guess for a, welcoming
session, that makes sense.
Congratulations! I’d love to

00:00:45.946-->00:00:51.485
figure out how you found your
way here uh because we really
don’t advertise and it’s always

00:00:51.485-->00:00:57.824
been word of mouth, I think,
maybe in the very early years I
took out ads in like 2600 and

00:00:57.824-->00:01:03.096
there was like blacklisted 411
but after that, the last twenty
years we just really haven’t

00:01:03.096-->00:01:10.037
ever advertised it’s all social
media. And when I talk to people
about that their brains like

00:01:10.037-->00:01:12.639
[makes mind blown noise] you
mean you have thirty thousand
people that show up in the

00:01:12.639-->00:01:19.413
desert and you don’t have a dime
spent on advertising? Like we
spend that money on like alcohol

00:01:19.413-->00:01:24.184
and [laughter] other things. I’d
rather have servers and hard
drives than a marketing person

00:01:24.184-->00:01:30.924
um. So anyway, so we’ve made it
here by just weird coincidence
of word of mouth and I think

00:01:30.924-->00:01:36.163
it’s a winning formula, it’s
very social and so you’ll notice
a lot of the things that we say

00:01:36.163-->00:01:41.768
around DefCon are these uh sort
of truisms like uh the Con is
what you make of it. And that

00:01:41.768-->00:01:48.408
sounds marketing-ish but it’s
not invented by a marketer uh it
was more of a way of us saying

00:01:48.408-->00:01:53.647
basically it’s what you make of
it, so go fix it yourself, kind
of, right? If you see something

00:01:53.647-->00:01:58.685
wrong, do something about it.
Get some people together, and if
you see that mentality, that’s

00:01:58.685-->00:02:05.025
why this year we have a record
number of villages. Like twenty
eight villages or something? Um

00:02:05.025-->00:02:10.030
Yeah, that’s a record number
[applause] And so tell you a
little bit about you are all

00:02:16.636-->00:02:23.543
here experiencing our experi- uh
an experiment. I talked a little
bit about it in uh in welcome

00:02:23.543-->00:02:30.384
note in the program but we’ve
never done uh a multi-hotel
before, it’s all scary and brand

00:02:30.384-->00:02:36.657
new, and we had no idea what to
expect, like will people venture
out with the burning orb go

00:02:36.657-->00:02:41.662
across the street [laughter]
like how does that work? We have
no idea let’s find out uh so

00:02:45.399-->00:02:50.604
once we got that extra space
because we were pretty certain
we outgrew Caesar’s last year uh

00:02:50.604-->00:02:55.776
it allowed us to do things like
grow for the first time in a
number of years uh add new

00:02:55.776-->00:03:00.714
events that we’ve never been
able to do uh so there’s more
content in villages and contests

00:03:06.386-->00:03:10.891
now than there are main speaking
tracks, right? It was always
like, the speaking track was the

00:03:10.891-->00:03:17.597
main thing and then we had some
villages and contests, but now
because we have extra space and

00:03:17.597-->00:03:22.602
because we just try to give uh a
platform to people who wanna try
something new, that side has

00:03:24.638-->00:03:31.378
exploded. So now we’ve got
people who will never see a
talk, and only do villages, and

00:03:31.378-->00:03:36.917
that's okay right? We record the
talks, we give em away for free,
do the things that you wanna do,

00:03:36.917-->00:03:42.089
don’t feel that you have to see
a talk or your friends will like
talk shame you you can uh make

00:03:42.089-->00:03:47.094
of the con what you want. So
that brings me to my second
point is we try to record

00:03:50.430-->00:03:56.937
everything, with union rates
that gets really expensive so we
couldn’t record everything we

00:03:56.937-->00:04:02.576
wanted to but we record as much
as we can and we release it all
because if it’s not recorded it

00:04:02.576-->00:04:07.581
sort of doesn’t exist um and the
whole theory I guess behind
DefCon is it’s a community

00:04:09.983-->00:04:15.755
event, I want everybody to get
the information, And in the
early days I was concerned I was

00:04:15.755-->00:04:21.228
like well if i give away the
content, why would people come?
You know they'll just wait for

00:04:21.228-->00:04:26.233
it. And then it took about two
years to figure out that no, VR
and augmented reality, and

00:04:28.401-->00:04:34.174
meeting at a distance, and
tele-travel, and all this stuff,
nobody cares about that. We have

00:04:34.174-->00:04:39.212
faster bandwidth more realistic
tele-everything and all the
conferences have record

00:04:39.212-->00:04:45.418
attendance because people want
to meet people, right? They
don’t want walk uh meet an ipad

00:04:45.418-->00:04:51.258
on uh you know a wheel driving
around they wanna see actual
humans, that’s what’s going on

00:04:51.258-->00:04:57.130
here and so ever since that
realization, every year I try to
figure out how to make humans

00:04:57.130-->00:05:01.968
meet humans, what do we have to
do? Break you guys into smaller
groups, get you into lock

00:05:01.968-->00:05:06.573
picking, get you into hardware
hacking, find little affinity
groups. Yes there’s billions of

00:05:06.573-->00:05:13.280
people here but we spend a lot
of time figuring out how to get
you into groups of people you

00:05:13.280-->00:05:20.187
want to meet and hang out with
uh and that allow you to kind of
jump around between them. So you

00:05:20.187-->00:05:25.192
guys think that’s working is
that a worthy goal? Keep that
up? [applause] yeah? There’s now

00:05:29.262-->00:05:34.601
uh there’s no manual for this so
a lot of it we just kind of
invent as we go. Uh so for

00:05:34.601-->00:05:39.906
example some of the big
inventions this year is uh
really trying to increase

00:05:39.906-->00:05:44.678
transparency around the con. You
saw some posts at the last
minute um we’d been working on

00:05:44.678-->00:05:49.749
for awhile and then we realized
you know if we don’t post these
soon it’s gonna be too late so

00:05:49.749-->00:05:55.255
um a couple years ago we started
putting the the departments of
where the goons are working on

00:05:55.255-->00:06:01.461
the back of their shirts and uh
and last year we wanted to get
um every shirt individually

00:06:01.461-->00:06:05.465
named so you could see who
you’re talking to but the
problem is we realize da lot of

00:06:05.465-->00:06:10.737
people in Vegas wear backpacks
and that would cover up the name
and so we started to produce all

00:06:10.737-->00:06:15.008
these t-shirts with names on it
that nobody would read, we’re
like [claps] okay that’s not

00:06:15.008-->00:06:20.280
gonna work. So this year we went
to this patch idea where the
patch kinda clamps on the badge

00:06:20.280-->00:06:25.685
um and then that way when you’re
talking to someone you kinda
know who you're talking to um

00:06:25.685-->00:06:32.492
and at first I thought you know
that’s loss of anonymity uh and
it turns out the goons really

00:06:32.492-->00:06:37.330
like it because they can put
whatever they want on there
[chuckles] so it’s not like

00:06:37.330-->00:06:41.534
they’re putting their real name
but it was just a way for you to
you know personalize. We also um

00:06:41.534-->00:06:46.806
started last year this
transparency report just trying
to tell you like what kind of

00:06:46.806-->00:06:52.545
shenanigans we put up with, how
many people we kick out and why,
those kinds of things, and I

00:06:52.545-->00:06:57.083
fully expect those numbers to
increase, because I think what’s
going to happen is people will

00:06:57.083-->00:07:01.421
get more comfortable with
reporting things, and as they
get more comfortable the numbers

00:07:01.421-->00:07:05.492
will increase, just it’s
natural, right? So if people
think we’re never going to do

00:07:05.492-->00:07:09.396
anything about it, they’re not
going to report anything,
they'll complain on Twitter but

00:07:09.396-->00:07:14.601
they won’t tell us, we’ll find
out about it the hard way, uh
but if they see that we’re

00:07:14.601-->00:07:19.472
actually doing something they’ll
start coming forward to us and
then our numbers will increase.

00:07:19.472-->00:07:23.910
And I’m not terrified of
increased numbers I think that’s
healthy so sort of my way of

00:07:23.910-->00:07:28.148
saying if you see something
really sketchy going on, you
think there’s a code of conduct

00:07:28.148-->00:07:33.420
violation or someone’s about to
burn down the hotel please don’t
just video it and put it on

00:07:33.420-->00:07:40.360
Youtube [laughter] just I mean
tell us about it and then post
the video but give us a chance

00:07:40.360-->00:07:45.365
to respond first. Um [laughs]
someone added, I mean, I love
that there’s com- competing

00:07:48.568-->00:07:53.006
trackers to try to figure out
wh- wh- by a show of hands, how
many people here are using the

00:07:53.006-->00:07:59.713
Hacker Tracker? Awesome. Okay
how many people are trying the
Ow- Owtel website where you can

00:07:59.713-->00:08:05.485
see the whole entire schedule on
one page? Not many people using
Owtel. You can do a CS- I mean

00:08:05.485-->00:08:10.490
you can do a um what is it a a
Ical, caldav invite, get it on
your calendar and sync it with-

00:08:12.492-->00:08:17.564
so there’s these, we’ve two
giant scheduling platforms just
to try and figure out how many

00:08:17.564-->00:08:22.569
uh talks we had. The last count
we had almost six hundred.
That’s like five or six times

00:08:26.172-->00:08:31.177
[applause] yeah! So when people
say do you know what’s going on?
No, I have no idea [laughs] I

00:08:35.682-->00:08:42.155
don’t know what’s going on. Um I
mean we provide maybe a hundred
and twenty of those talks,

00:08:42.155-->00:08:48.161
hundred and forty, the rest is
all straight up from villages
and other. So that’s what's so

00:08:48.161-->00:08:51.464
awesome about this community we
give you a little platform and
next thing you know you’ve got

00:08:51.464-->00:08:58.405
100 talks and uh you know
people, ex ambassadors to the UN
coming and talking about voting

00:08:58.405-->00:09:04.844
villages uh voting machines. So
this is a formula we’re gonna
stick with. Now going forward

00:09:04.844-->00:09:10.050
you might have also noticed in
the program, this is our last
year at Caesar’s. That doesn’t

00:09:10.050-->00:09:17.056
mean burn down Caesar’s
[audience laughs] that means
leave it intact um so the

00:09:17.056-->00:09:21.494
property will have us at other
ones right? Ideally we would
actually clean the windows on

00:09:21.494-->00:09:27.767
the way out so they would be
really impressed with us. Um so
next year um I’ll talk about it

00:09:27.767-->00:09:33.173
at closing ceremonies, we’re
gonna switch hotels, uh next
year. And when we switch we’re

00:09:33.173-->00:09:38.411
hoping to get a little bit
better layout and we’re gonna
continue uh this large variety

00:09:38.411-->00:09:44.217
of villages um and the other
thing is we’re doing a little
creative destruction here so if

00:09:44.217-->00:09:48.221
there’s villages that you go to
and they’re absolutely like
what’s going on here this is a

00:09:48.221-->00:09:53.460
disaster, let us know. And if
there’s villages that you go to
that you absolutely love, let us

00:09:53.460-->00:09:59.032
know. Because we need to see who
who can cut the mustard um and
keep giving the stage to the

00:09:59.032-->00:10:03.303
people who are doing a good job
and then give somebody a new
chance if there’s some villages

00:10:03.303-->00:10:08.341
that aren’t doing very well,
right? That’s we want this kind
of turmoil and churn in the

00:10:08.341-->00:10:13.346
villages so there’s new stuff
put on by people excited by it.
Um also I- wa- I kinda want- how

00:10:16.216-->00:10:21.221
do I do this, how do I get your
opinion? Um DefCon is a hacker
con we try really hard to keep

00:10:26.326-->00:10:31.331
it hacker it’s not an infosec
con right? And some people are
confused about the difference,

00:10:33.933-->00:10:38.638
sometimes I get confused on the
difference, but we’re not
sponsored, we’ve never been

00:10:38.638-->00:10:45.545
sponsored, we try really hard to
make the hacker mentality
infused in everything we do um

00:10:45.545-->00:10:50.116
and that’s really hard because
there’s so much money involved
now, right? Everybody’s got a

00:10:50.116-->00:10:55.121
career, everybody’s got a a
ladder they’re climbing or a
specialty and so when we think

00:10:58.157-->00:11:03.096
about what does it mean to be a
hacker con versus infosec con
the thing that really

00:11:03.096-->00:11:08.468
crystalized it for me was about
four or five years ago I was
talking to a a past CEO of

00:11:08.468-->00:11:14.607
Facebook they’ve gone through a
number but past Facebook uh CSO
and I said hey are you going to

00:11:14.607-->00:11:20.713
Blackhat? He said no I don’t I
don’t send my people uh to
Blackhat I was like what what

00:11:20.713-->00:11:25.818
are you talking about? There’s
like all these incredible ninjas
doing trainings and classes and

00:11:25.818-->00:11:31.524
he’s like yeah but if I go to an
infosec event I have people that
are really good at one thing and

00:11:31.524-->00:11:35.461
I send them to a training and
they get better they get like
this much better or that much

00:11:35.461-->00:11:40.900
better and then I send them to a
talk and they get this much
better and they’re taking their

00:11:40.900-->00:11:44.070
existing skills and they’re
getting a little bit better it’s
like polishing a blade just a

00:11:44.070-->00:11:49.175
little bit more. He’s like I’m
not interested in that I send
everybody to DefCon because I

00:11:49.175-->00:11:55.281
need to teach my people how to
think. It’s like you know how do
you approach a problem, how do

00:11:55.281-->00:12:00.386
you problem solve, how do you
like explore new concepts, how
do you just through the joy of

00:12:00.386-->00:12:07.360
discovery stumble into a room
and learn a whole new thing that
excited you, right? And so

00:12:07.360-->00:12:12.999
that’s uh that joy of discovery,
that sort of accidental
discovery, that’s something

00:12:12.999-->00:12:18.605
we’re really trying hard to grow
and so I don’t know if that
resonates with you, but I see

00:12:18.605-->00:12:23.610
that as one big difference um so
not an infosec con, hacker con
[laughs][applause]. Um so

00:12:35.021-->00:12:40.159
thinking about that you know
what is hacker? And it’s funny
because uh it’s changed over the

00:12:40.159-->00:12:46.633
years, right? In the early days
we spent so much, I spent, so
much time. Half of my time was

00:12:46.633-->00:12:52.372
spent trying to figure out who
to meet, and what they knew, and
could they teach it to me? And

00:12:52.372-->00:12:56.209
then I’d only have like thirty
percent of my time actually
doing the thing that I learned

00:12:56.209-->00:13:01.547
about because I had to burn all
my energy on figuring out who
knew what and could they share

00:13:01.547-->00:13:06.986
it with me. Nowadays I think
that’s flipped you there’s an
unlimited number of things for

00:13:06.986-->00:13:12.458
you to learn uh and you have
access to it on Youtube and on
videos and conferences so you’re

00:13:12.458-->00:13:17.630
not spending forty or fifty
percent of your time trying to
figure out who knows what, you

00:13:17.630-->00:13:22.535
can spend eighty percent of your
time just doing the thing and
it’s almost like this

00:13:22.535-->00:13:28.941
embarrassment of riches we have
right now um and so I’ll get up
and I’ll look at the content and

00:13:28.941-->00:13:32.545
it’s a time management thing now
for me it’s like man I wish I
had time for that, I wish I had

00:13:32.545-->00:13:35.848
time for that, I wish I had time
for that, where before I
wouldn’t even know half of those

00:13:35.848-->00:13:41.487
things existed um so we’re in
this land of plenty, we’re
hackers, and we want to tear it

00:13:41.487-->00:13:46.225
all apart, and some people get
to the show and their heads
explode because they’re just

00:13:46.225-->00:13:51.998
overwhelmed with things to do.
It’s like don’t worry about it
collect some cards, talk to some

00:13:51.998-->00:13:56.536
people, make some notes, you’ll
have the whole rest of the year
to get caught up on everything

00:13:56.536-->00:14:01.474
you saw here, it’s more
important I think to make the
relationships uh and later on

00:14:04.410-->00:14:10.616
you can spend all your waking
hours on the tech. Because I
think ultimately hacking is

00:14:10.616-->00:14:17.590
really social and if you notice
the badges um for this year and
almost all years uh when L0st

00:14:17.590-->00:14:22.261
was creating them or Joe Grand
was creating them, when Joe
first started doing some of our

00:14:22.261-->00:14:28.000
badges we spent a lot of our
time talking about how do we use
the badge as a tool to force

00:14:28.000-->00:14:33.706
people to actually be social?
Because a lot of us aren’t right
we kind of we kind of sometimes

00:14:33.706-->00:14:38.544
lack those skills but if we have
an excuse, a tech excuse, hey
it’s not me man it’s just the

00:14:38.544-->00:14:43.049
badge, the badge is making me
talk to you [audience laughs]
you know I mean normally I’d

00:14:43.049-->00:14:48.121
never answer your call or your
phone but you know the badge is
doing it. So we spend a lot of

00:14:48.121-->00:14:53.359
time like how do we make the
badge force you to interact and
we’ve done it with wireless,

00:14:53.359-->00:14:58.965
infrared, and near feel, um
we’ve tried a lot of things,
this year you know you see the-

00:14:58.965-->00:15:03.669
the mating plug in ten
milliseconds or less so you
don’t have to spend too much

00:15:03.669-->00:15:08.674
time talking to someone
[laughter] um uh with the social
game an- it forces you to to

00:15:12.145-->00:15:16.682
sort of puzzle it out if we gave
you all the rules and gave you
all the the how tos it might not

00:15:16.682-->00:15:21.921
be as easy, right? It’s still a
hacking con you might notice
there’s a serial port here you

00:15:21.921-->00:15:26.926
can get on and play the game
that way as well. So we put a
lot of energy thinking into how

00:15:29.128-->00:15:34.801
to make things more social for
you and to attendees that might
just be sort of background noise

00:15:34.801-->00:15:40.373
but to us in the backend it’s
funny we obsess on these little
things um trying to figure out

00:15:40.373-->00:15:44.644
what you like and what don’t you
like that teaches you some
skills. So for example in the

00:15:44.644-->00:15:50.316
early years the reason we
started hardware badges, the
reason I got Joe to do it is

00:15:50.316-->00:15:56.522
because I felt that people were
losing hardware skills. At that
time everything was software.

00:15:56.522-->00:16:03.329
Hardware was like black magic
voodoo. And I was thinking if I
was a real hacker, if I was some

00:16:03.329-->00:16:08.334
Johnny Mnemonic you know I would
be up in the hardware business
right that’s where all a lot of

00:16:11.704-->00:16:18.177
stuff happens but as hackers if
we’re gonna be the resistance we
can’t even connect to a console

00:16:18.177-->00:16:24.550
port so how do we get people
interested in hardware? How do
we get that going? And it’s been

00:16:24.550-->00:16:30.790
more than ten years and now we
have what over a hundred and
something hardware badges this

00:16:30.790-->00:16:36.896
year at con, over a hundred
different ones from one right
people are not intimidated by

00:16:36.896-->00:16:41.567
hardware anymore, people are
having a lot of fun, we can do
this, and so if I can plant a

00:16:41.567-->00:16:46.572
seed and then the community just
explodes like I have to tell you
still to this day I know about

00:16:49.208-->00:16:54.213
this much about hardware but
that doesn’t mean I can’t try to
help foster it so this year um

00:16:56.616-->00:17:01.921
is I wanna introduce TYMKRS who
designed it, they’re gonna go
through a little bit of the

00:17:01.921-->00:17:07.260
game, try not to give it all
away and I’m also gonna show you
off this is the uber badge for

00:17:07.260-->00:17:14.133
this year. Um and we’ve talked a
little bit about that the magic
black ink that turned out to not

00:17:14.133-->00:17:16.335
be that magic um and so this is
what the winners of uh certain
contests will get this year it’s

00:17:16.335-->00:17:18.337
the admission for life, uh for
DefCon if you- if you earn you
don’t win it, you earn it, uh a

00:17:18.337-->00:17:22.275
black badge, and so I’ll be
showing this off uh throughout
uh the con and then we give away

00:17:22.275-->00:17:27.280
and announce the winners, the
only winners of contests that
get black badges that know it

00:17:37.023-->00:17:41.727
are the capture the flag
winners. Everybody else we
really don’t reveal which

00:17:41.727-->00:17:46.732
contests will get it um one in
the past when we did that people
gamed it and everybody just only

00:17:48.768-->00:17:53.372
played on black badge events and
it kind of hurt the other
contests and then some of the

00:17:53.372-->00:17:58.377
contests that were new that were
black badge contests, some of
them just kind of rusted and

00:17:58.377-->00:18:03.616
they didn’t- they didn’t keep up
their game uh and because there
wasn’t a lot of competition,

00:18:03.616-->00:18:08.321
they just knew they had it and
so once we made it a variable,
maybe you get it maybe you don’t

00:18:08.321-->00:18:12.725
everybody started to up their
game again uh so if you’re
wondering why am I wearing this

00:18:12.725-->00:18:19.031
little death skull um this is
cause I’ve got the black badge
I’m keeping it real here. Okay

00:18:19.031-->00:18:24.337
with that said I wanna hand it
over to Abby from the TYMKRS, do
you have a microphone? You’ve

00:18:24.337-->00:18:28.507
got one. She’s got some slides
she’s gonna step through and
then I think we’re gonna have

00:18:28.507-->00:18:33.512
time do you wnana do some Q and
A at the end? Yeah guys? Yeah?
Yeah, okay [applause]. coffee

00:18:41.287-->00:18:46.292
>>Yes please [laughs] alright hi
everyone, hello, welcome to the
DefCon 26 official badge talk uh

00:18:54.467-->00:18:59.472
we’re the TYMKRS and the
creators of this years badge. Uh
let’s see here oh! [applause]

00:19:07.546-->00:19:12.551
thank you um but before we get
started talking about the badge
I wanted to make sure to give

00:19:15.388-->00:19:20.393
proper homage to those that came
before us uh so to Joe Kingpin
Grand who started these badges

00:19:23.462-->00:19:28.467
with uh Dark Tangent from years
14 to 18 and Ryan L0stBoy Clarke
who did years 19 and 24 if we

00:19:30.669-->00:19:35.674
could give a rousing round of
applause for those [applause]
Alright, so who are we? We are

00:19:44.083-->00:19:49.889
the TYMKRS uh the badge team
this year consisted of a
hardware engineer, Wire, uh a

00:19:49.889-->00:19:54.894
software ninja who you can’t
see, because she’s a ninja, uh
Whisker, and a nurse. And uh we

00:19:58.431-->00:20:03.436
really got our start from ma-
fro- into the uh infosec
conference community by making

00:20:06.105-->00:20:11.110
uh badges for CypherCon which is
an infosec con in Wisconsin, so
flyover state, but we love it

00:20:14.146-->00:20:19.151
[laughs]. So some numbers um
this year we made 28,220, a lot.
[applause] and this ranged all

00:20:23.989-->00:20:28.994
the way from 26,300 human badges
to 25 coveted Uber badges. Uh
each badge had 91 components and

00:20:37.636-->00:20:43.843
so uh this led to me shepherding
about two point six million
different components uh for the

00:20:43.843-->00:20:50.349
system. There are 43 LEDs per
badge with the RGBs broken out
there and on the bottom right

00:20:50.349-->00:20:56.522
you’ll see the total number of
emails that were sent through
the course of this process

00:20:56.522-->00:21:02.728
[laughter] and if you’re
medically minded this is also
the graph that shows my cortisol

00:21:02.728-->00:21:07.733
levels [laughter] alright. So uh
just a little bit about the
background. We were gracially-

00:21:14.039-->00:21:19.044
graciously asked by Dark Tangent
to do this very um humbling just
oh my god [laughs] um to create

00:21:23.716-->00:21:29.755
this year’s badge back in
November and the interesting
thing about this timeline is

00:21:29.755-->00:21:34.793
that due to lead times we
actually had to order parts
before we could get a working

00:21:34.793-->00:21:39.798
prototype so thankfully the team
got it right the first time um
and our prototype was completed

00:21:41.800-->00:21:48.507
in May and firmware completed in
June. Now with the order this
large, when you need to program

00:21:48.507-->00:21:54.480
29 thousand microcontrollers,
usually the easiest time to
program these as the chips are

00:21:54.480-->00:21:59.485
being manufactured and uh we
just didn't have time to do that
and so we asked a chip supplier

00:22:02.922-->00:22:09.662
uh to see if they could program
these chips for us they said
sure no problem um and they had

00:22:09.662-->00:22:16.001
six months essentially to figure
out how to do this. So fast
forward to about three to four

00:22:16.001-->00:22:21.006
weeks ago they [laughter] they
say, heyyy we don’t actually
know how to program these chips

00:22:27.479-->00:22:33.552
[laughter] and they sent a
screenshot of their programming
machines to ask if we could tell

00:22:33.552-->00:22:38.557
them what checkboxes to check in
order to program the chips. I
said thanks for nothing let’s

00:22:42.861-->00:22:47.866
overnight these to our fab.
Which they took 5 days to
overnight yeah so thankfully uh

00:22:50.869-->00:22:57.743
the fab that we worked with
E-TekNet, uh amazing folks uh
they uh hired some temp workers

00:22:57.743-->00:23:02.681
and so all the badges that you
guys have on you have been hand
programmed by those six temp

00:23:05.150-->00:23:10.155
workers [applause]. Yeah yep yep
and of course uh it would not be
a DefCon badge if there weren’t

00:23:20.599-->00:23:25.471
shipment issues [laughter] now
they did get here on time which
I hear is actually kind of rare

00:23:25.471-->00:23:32.177
>>It’s really rare >>Yeah um but
tradewar caused a lot of
problems uh so shipments that

00:23:32.177-->00:23:37.182
were supposed to take 5 days
would take 10. Shipments that
would be overnight would take

00:23:39.718-->00:23:44.723
days, overnight just really
isn't a thing. [off-mic comment]
Yeah pricing changes a little

00:23:46.792-->00:23:51.797
bit too yeah um but fortunately
I got the personal desk numbers
of a couple of Fedex custom team

00:23:54.300-->00:23:59.638
members thank you Adrienne and
Bailey, you guys rock! Um And
they were able to help push

00:23:59.638-->00:24:04.576
these badges through and um so
our thanks to them.
[whistle][applause] Alright so

00:24:08.681-->00:24:13.686
the theme of the okay so the
theme of DefCon this year is
1983 which is in relation to the

00:24:22.962-->00:24:28.634
book 1984 written by George
Orwell now if you’ve never read
the book, one you totally

00:24:28.634-->00:24:33.639
should, very appropriate, two um
it’s full of concepts such as
big brother, uh thought crime,

00:24:36.608-->00:24:42.181
perpetual war against the other
come from, um really essentially
describes a society that is

00:24:42.181-->00:24:47.186
completely counter to hacker
ethics uh so in the book there
are different ministries, so the

00:24:49.788-->00:24:54.793
ministry of truth where um let’s
see where it deals in
revisionist history and changing

00:24:58.630-->00:25:05.337
what was true to match what the
party now says is true. The
ministry of plenty which rations

00:25:05.337-->00:25:11.243
food, the ministry of peace
which is actually the war arm of
the party, the ministry of love

00:25:11.243-->00:25:16.248
where if you don’t love the
party, they’ll torture you until
you do um and so fortunately we

00:25:19.351-->00:25:24.356
are time travelers here! Welcome
to the year 1983! Um this is the
year where we still have time to

00:25:27.659-->00:25:33.198
make decisions that can change
the future and avoid this
Orwellian collapse. Um and these

00:25:33.198-->00:25:37.569
decisions aren’t made by the
people in ivory towers, they’re
made by people like you and me,

00:25:37.569-->00:25:42.574
um it’s about what we choose to
do, what we choose to accept,
what we choose to ignore, um and

00:25:46.912-->00:25:51.517
this is these are decisions that
we make in our everyday lives
that impac- that impact what

00:25:51.517-->00:25:56.522
happens to us as a society. So
um because these decisions are
made by everyday us uh our

00:26:00.359-->00:26:05.364
design aesthetic overall is
everyday buildings for everyday
people and everyday people have

00:26:10.803-->00:26:15.808
different stories. So uh each
type of badge, human, goon,
contest, eccetera, is a

00:26:18.577-->00:26:24.917
different interactive story. You
might start out as an employee,
a visitor, a student, etcetera.

00:26:24.917-->00:26:30.923
And if everyone if everyone
would look at their badge, you
might notice that the DefCon

00:26:30.923-->00:26:35.928
letters are lit red, green, uh
lightish green, or not at all.
These are reflective of the

00:26:38.831-->00:26:45.571
choices that have been made in
your story, and the status of
your puzzles. So the letter N is

00:26:45.571-->00:26:50.576
what the sum of your choices
have identified you as. Uh in
other words, your alignment.

00:26:53.278-->00:26:58.283
Where red stands for
contributing to the rise of
dystopian doom, for shame. And

00:27:00.619-->00:27:07.326
green is contributing to a
healthy hacker friendly future
uh you’ll also notice little

00:27:07.326-->00:27:12.331
people roaming on your badge. So
the green individual is you,
because we have high hopes, the

00:27:14.433-->00:27:20.405
red one is your little goon, and
that’s right, this year at
DefCon everyone gets their own

00:27:20.405-->00:27:27.112
goon that you can stuff in your
pocket. [laughter] So just as
you can make choices in your own

00:27:27.112-->00:27:33.619
story, your little goon can also
make choices in the story so if
you prefer that your little goon

00:27:33.619-->00:27:40.592
makes the same choices as you
would it would be in your best
interests to find a big goon who

00:27:40.592-->00:27:47.299
has a badge with an alignment
which matches your alignment and
connecting your badge to theirs

00:27:47.299-->00:27:52.304
will allow your little goon to
inherit the alignment of big
goon. And just as that goon can

00:27:55.374-->00:28:00.312
affect your story based on the
choices they’ve made, the
choices you’ve made in your own

00:28:00.312-->00:28:05.317
story can affect any of the
other badges you connect to and
vice versa. [off mic comment]

00:28:09.288-->00:28:14.893
they can infect goons, oh yeah
[laughter] this is a two way
street dark tangent [laughter]

00:28:14.893-->00:28:21.199
alright so in order to get in
complete control of your own
lights, not only will your

00:28:21.199-->00:28:26.905
choices matter, but you’ll have
to seek out others of every
other badge type who’ve made

00:28:26.905-->00:28:31.910
good choices and or encourage
them or convince them to make
the right choices. So a

00:28:35.247-->00:28:40.352
potential goal then, a soft
goal, would be to get your
DefCon lights to be all the same

00:28:40.352-->00:28:45.357
color, either red, or green. So
badge basics. Uh we wanted to
make sure that the badge was

00:28:53.832-->00:28:59.237
immediately interactive so if
you notice on the bottom of your
badge uh there is a DefCon

00:28:59.237-->00:29:05.677
symbol and 26. These are touch
sensitive pads corresponding to
up down left right and plus and

00:29:05.677-->00:29:11.350
minus uh these work for moving
your character around and for
interacting with the puzzles at

00:29:11.350-->00:29:17.322
each position uh but because we
know that sometimes capacitive
work does- copass- sorry,

00:29:17.322-->00:29:22.561
capacitive touch doesn’t always
work in every environment and
with everybody's different uh

00:29:22.561-->00:29:28.934
fingers there’s a micro USB
connector at the bottom of the
badge so uh this allows you to

00:29:28.934-->00:29:33.939
power the badge without
batteries and also makes the
game much much easier. So just

00:29:36.742-->00:29:41.179
some basics uh once you’ve
plugged the badge if you don’t
have the drivers you may need to

00:29:41.179-->00:29:46.184
get Microchip USB CDC drivers uh
it’ll assign a COM port to your
badge you’ll want to open up a

00:29:48.887-->00:29:55.160
serial terminal emulator uh for
Windows we use PuTTY, um Mac,
Screen, Android Phones you can

00:29:55.160-->00:30:00.165
use Serial USB Terminal and you
just wanna make sure that to
access it you can uh you write

00:30:03.468-->00:30:09.841
the correct COM port associated
with your badge and uh to access
the graphics you may wanna turn

00:30:09.841-->00:30:14.846
on IBM code page 437. And all of
this is so that you’re able to
access the ANSI version of the

00:30:21.119-->00:30:26.124
badge. So ANSI is used, was
used, by artists in the
text-mode art scene on BBS’s way

00:30:28.293-->00:30:33.298
back when and the artwork is 80
by columns wide by 80 rows tall
and on your terminal screen

00:30:36.435-->00:30:41.440
you’ll see about 80 by 25. Okay
so when you plug it in get the
serial terminal emulator up uh

00:30:47.179-->00:30:52.184
you’ll see the following screen
at least if you’re human um and
this is a screenshot of the

00:30:54.486-->00:31:00.292
garage on the human’s badge and
you’ll see that there’s some
story text on the bottom as well

00:31:00.292-->00:31:05.797
as text based on the decisions
you’ve made. On the bottom left
hand side are the controls you

00:31:05.797-->00:31:10.802
can use which also show you what
directions you’re able to go so
green for go, red for no go,

00:31:13.171-->00:31:18.977
white for that’s not even an
option. Uh the bottom right will
then also show you what your

00:31:18.977-->00:31:23.982
DefCon letters are. So since
these oh no we’re here uh no
we’re through it okay sorry

00:31:29.454-->00:31:34.459
[laughs] so since these lights
also reflect the status of your
puzzles note that this badge has

00:31:36.528-->00:31:42.033
both software and hardware
puzzles. The main
microcontroller on the badge is

00:31:42.033-->00:31:47.038
a Pick 32 MM you can interface
with it using MP Lab X um and
you can reprogram it using a

00:31:50.475-->00:31:55.480
PICKit 3 or 4 and hardware
puzzles do exist. Alright so now
that we’ve gotten through the

00:31:58.483-->00:32:04.956
meat of the badge uh here are
some side by side pictures of
the badges and the drawings they

00:32:04.956-->00:32:10.896
were based off of. Um I’ll also
point out some choice cool
things that I am particularly

00:32:10.896-->00:32:15.901
fond of cause I drew em so you
know. Alright human badge, you
guys got the garage, uh now the

00:32:18.436-->00:32:23.441
cool thing about this is uh you
guys get a ramen shop because
who doesn’t like ramen, right?

00:32:25.844-->00:32:31.917
We’ve got a nod to uh back to
the future, we’ve got a nod to
metropolis and you also get a

00:32:31.917-->00:32:36.922
subway train in your basement.
Press badge, you guys get a
broadcast station uh so one you

00:32:43.695-->00:32:48.700
get a satellite dish, that’s the
size of Montana, um and along
the bottom, uh the very bottom,

00:32:50.902-->00:32:57.175
well first we put you in the
basement of your company and uh
along the bottom you’ll notice

00:32:57.175-->00:33:02.113
that the technologies go from
laptop to CRRT to Typewriter, to
uh pen and paper. And you get a

00:33:06.718-->00:33:11.723
photography room too. Goon
badge. Uh this is a Panopticon
and uh this particular badge had

00:33:16.328-->00:33:22.367
maybe the most cyberpunky
graphics I would say um you guys
also get a lot of interrogation

00:33:22.367-->00:33:27.372
rooms [laughter] Contest badge
uh this is based off a library.
One, who doesn’t like libraries,

00:33:31.509-->00:33:37.349
I love libraries >>Woo! >>Woo!
>>Libraries!
[laughter][applause] >>Um there

00:33:37.349-->00:33:42.354
are multiple fireplaces and you
got a rockin’ lounge in the
basement as well. The vendor

00:33:49.561-->00:33:56.368
badge, uh this one is a factory
and my favorite part about this
is that there’s a crane in the

00:33:56.368-->00:34:01.306
basement because I thought if I
can put a crane in a badge, why
not, so there you go. Speaker

00:34:06.645-->00:34:11.650
badge um this is a theater.
There are performance theaters,
movie theaters, uh and drive in

00:34:14.853-->00:34:19.858
movie theaters and so you oh and
you’ll also get like a rock
concert hall so. The artist

00:34:23.762-->00:34:28.934
badge, this is based off a
gallery, uh there’s a gallery,
there’s a performance hall, and

00:34:28.934-->00:34:33.939
I even give a little nod to the
curators for dealing with all of
the uh desecrated mummies uh and

00:34:36.541-->00:34:41.546
boxes and shipments in the
basement. And the CFP badge uh
you may notice on the top there

00:34:45.650-->00:34:50.655
is architecture from MIT uh we
thought it would be pretty
recognizable. Uh but below that

00:34:53.358-->00:34:59.030
there is an underground server
room, there’s sewers and there’s
even a mine because apparently

00:34:59.030-->00:35:03.535
there are universities out there
that have mines in their school
and so you have a stegosaurus

00:35:03.535-->00:35:08.540
fossil there too. Woops, oh no.
[laughter] Alright.
[indiscernible] but but before

00:35:24.356-->00:35:29.361
we do the thanks I wanted to
make sure to get a few out PSAs
out. One please put the

00:35:32.163-->00:35:37.168
batteries in the correct way
[laughter] [whistle] [applause]
Yeah so we do have reverse

00:35:44.376-->00:35:50.982
polarity protection um so the
badges that did get leaked on
are actually perfectly fine as

00:35:50.982-->00:35:56.354
long as you clean them up but if
you reverse even just one
battery, and we tested this, if

00:35:56.354-->00:36:02.527
you reverse just one battery,
after about a half hour you will
learn the wet wear hacking part

00:36:02.527-->00:36:07.532
of our badge [laughter] please
don’t [laughs]. You wanna say
why that happened? >>So what’s

00:36:11.102-->00:36:16.074
going on here is to get the
duration out of the battery pack
to try and last the entire con

00:36:16.074-->00:36:20.378
without having to replace
batteries we put a buck boost
regulator on there so it will

00:36:20.378-->00:36:26.985
run from 6 volts down to about 2
and a half. If you put one
battery in backwards you get

00:36:26.985-->00:36:32.924
plus 1 point 5 minus 1 point 5
from the battery that’s
backwards plus 1 point 5 plus 1

00:36:32.924-->00:36:37.462
point 5, so you get three volts,
the battery is happy. But that
one battery that’s backwards

00:36:37.462-->00:36:42.934
you’re trying to charge it.
[laughter] very very >>It’s non
rechargeable folks >>So it it

00:36:42.934-->00:36:48.840
doesn’t get hot it actually just
internally degasses and until
the pressure pop- builds up and

00:36:48.840-->00:36:54.946
then you hear a pop >>Which is
kinda [laughter] >>Yep I heard
the pop [laughter] >>It’s kind

00:36:54.946-->00:36:59.951
of interesting actually the MAOH
that’s in it is the will make
your skin feel kind of slippery

00:37:02.854-->00:37:09.327
and it’s the same stuff that’s
in soap so it’s kind of creepy
>>So it’ll clean our shirts?

00:37:09.327-->00:37:14.699
[laughter] >>Sure >>No
>>[laughs] Um the other things
is there have been some pretty

00:37:14.699-->00:37:19.704
awesome legends dropping around
uh this badge which is totally
fun to hear um but you can take

00:37:22.173-->00:37:27.445
the batteries out uh the game
will restart where you are
positionally but all of your

00:37:27.445-->00:37:32.984
linkages as well as your
decisions will still remain so
please if you need to sleep,

00:37:32.984-->00:37:37.989
take the batteries out, k? Okay
so finally we wanted to do our
[off mic comment] Oh total run

00:37:41.092-->00:37:46.097
time is about 65 to 70 hours.
Okay? So get some sleep
[laughter] >>If you’re putting

00:37:48.133-->00:37:54.038
the SAOs on >>Oh we can’t
guarantee >>That runtime will
vary greatly it >>Yeah >>It will

00:37:54.038-->00:37:59.043
not. Well. I have not seen an
add on that made it- will make
it run longer [laughter] >>So

00:38:01.112-->00:38:05.617
our thanks of course uh to
E-TekNet and their temp workers
for again uh manually

00:38:05.617-->00:38:12.357
programming all of these badges,
the Fedex customs team um are
badge pimp Michael Goetzman and

00:38:12.357-->00:38:15.960
CypherCon for just introducing
us to the rabbithole of badges,
Mara Williams for her art on the

00:38:15.960-->00:38:20.965
back um if you get all the
badges on the uh in a row in the
correct order you’ll get a mini

00:38:25.336-->00:38:30.341
mural from Mar uh Joe Grand for
opening our eyes to the
logistics issues involved in uh

00:38:33.044-->00:38:38.850
making this many badges and of
course you guys for wearing the
badges even though you’re kind

00:38:38.850-->00:38:43.855
of forced to [laughs] um but
also just you know being here
being DefCon um and so here’s to

00:38:46.291-->00:38:51.296
an awesome conference and we
hope you enjoy the badge
[applause] [cheers] Oh. [off mic

00:39:04.576-->00:39:08.613
comment] so after closing we are
gonna be releasing the source
code if someone else hasn’t

00:39:08.613-->00:39:13.885
already released it [laughter]
[off mic comment] and we’ll see
about the >>Oh tell them about

00:39:13.885-->00:39:19.224
the [off mic inaudible] Reddit,
>>Okay okay yeah um and we’ll
see about the schematics um

00:39:19.224-->00:39:24.896
again if they’re not already
leaked. Uh but there are a
number of places that I think

00:39:24.896-->00:39:29.601
people are working on these.
There are some impromptu badge
hacking villages that have

00:39:29.601-->00:39:35.840
cropped up around the place a
lot of the some of the chill out
rooms um but there’s a great

00:39:35.840-->00:39:41.913
article on hackaday uh by Mike
Stitch which shows kind of the
basics of the badge and I think

00:39:41.913-->00:39:46.918
Reddit also has uh our DefCon
also has some folks who are
giving out hints but hopefully

00:39:49.053-->00:39:54.058
this helped clear up a few
questions. Q and A >>Yeah okay
so let’s see we’ve got 5 whole

00:39:57.295-->00:40:02.800
minutes, let’s do one or two Q
and A, quick who can ever get to
the microphones. This guy wins

00:40:02.800-->00:40:08.006
>>Get to the mic right here!
>>Okay what do you got? Nobody?
He was walking past the

00:40:08.006-->00:40:13.011
microphone on the way out the
door [laughter] okay, that
explains that. No questions?

00:40:17.282-->00:40:21.219
Great. Well in that case. Oh
wait, we have one question right
here okay and then we’ll go.

00:40:21.219-->00:40:26.424
>>Run Forest >>Run to the
microphone >>Run Forest [off-mic
question] >>Oh which cab package

00:40:26.424-->00:40:31.429
was used to do the design? >>Pie
Cab >>Pi- Pie Cab >>Pie Cab
[off-mic chatter] >>Okay sir

00:40:35.433-->00:40:40.438
>>How much did it cost? >>How
much did it cost? We don’t know
yet [laughter] [clapping] um

00:40:45.977-->00:40:52.083
partially because um when you
order this many batteries you
get like thousands of pounds

00:40:52.083-->00:40:59.023
like tons of batteries and we
got shipped half the number of
batteries we needed so we get

00:40:59.023-->00:41:03.261
here and they’re like hey we
only have 56-->000 batteries,
where are the other 56-->000

00:41:03.261-->00:41:08.966
batteries, they’re like well
that’s all we shipped. So we had
somebody that spent like 15

00:41:08.966-->00:41:13.971
hours and in one day he found
all the remaining batteries in
California and Nevada

00:41:16.074-->00:41:21.079
[laughter][cheering] And uh
basically went to Frys and said
I heard a rumor you’ve got

00:41:25.717-->00:41:32.256
10-->000 batteries, sell them to
me [laughter] uh and so we know
that that’s about I think it was

00:41:32.256-->00:41:37.261
10-->000 batteries weighed 500
pounds in his trunk. >>wow >>So
yeah so we’re still calculating

00:41:40.264-->00:41:45.269
[laughs] the costs. Sir >>Oh
[off-mic question] try hacking
it can we reset it? >>If you try

00:41:47.705-->00:41:52.276
to hack it and screw it up, is
there a way to reset it? >>So
currently there is a way to

00:41:52.276-->00:41:58.449
reset it if you can find it
[laughter] it is not very it’s
intentionally not obvious um

00:41:58.449-->00:42:04.122
I’ve seen one Reddit post where
someone got really close but
they haven't gotten in yet um if

00:42:04.122-->00:42:07.625
you really get it screwed up
just come find me and I can
reprogram your badge and clear

00:42:07.625-->00:42:13.798
it out. >>You know that reminds
me we, this year we created a
badge hacking area um so it’s

00:42:13.798-->00:42:17.502
near the hardware hacking
village in the solder skills
area. It’s just a big open area

00:42:17.502-->00:42:22.607
with a bunch of tables and power
and it's just for people
interested in badges and

00:42:22.607-->00:42:27.245
engineering them and solving
puzzles to go so we gave you a
dedicated space this year. Okay

00:42:27.245-->00:42:32.717
last question to this gentleman
in the white hat. >>Thank you.
Uh we so we only just when you

00:42:32.717-->00:42:38.022
mentioned about the the
allegiance uh with the green and
the red we pretty much have all

00:42:38.022-->00:42:44.429
the badges we went around and
met all the badges for we do we
have to go realign to change the

00:42:44.429-->00:42:49.434
colors? [laughs] oh no. Thank
you >>Yeah [laughter] and on
that happy note thank you

00:42:53.771-->00:42:58.776
everyone and see you at DefCon!
>>Woo! [applause][cheers]
