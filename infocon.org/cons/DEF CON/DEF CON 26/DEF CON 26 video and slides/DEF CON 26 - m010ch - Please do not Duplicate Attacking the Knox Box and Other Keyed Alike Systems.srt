00:00:00.033-->00:00:05.706
>>A little bit about myself. I’m
malak on Twitter. I’m 18, I’m a
student from the Bay area and I

00:00:05.706-->00:00:10.510
really like locks and computers.
Lately I’ve been getting really
interested in duplicating high

00:00:10.510-->00:00:16.416
security keys. Uh this my second
time going to DefCon and my
first time speaking and if

00:00:16.416-->00:00:20.521
you’re working on any
interesting lock projects, come
say hi. I’d love to hear about

00:00:20.521-->00:00:25.692
them. So you’ve probably seen
these things before. There’s a
good chance you even live or

00:00:25.692-->00:00:30.297
work in a building that has one.
And these boxes contain the keys
to the building. So when the

00:00:30.297-->00:00:34.201
firefighters show up in an
emergency, they don’t have to
start breaking stuff to get

00:00:34.201-->00:00:39.206
where they need to bed. They can
just open the box, get the keys
and let themselves in. A low

00:00:39.206-->00:00:42.543
tech way of doing this would be
to just keep copies of
everyone’s keys in the fire

00:00:42.543-->00:00:48.348
station, but having a single key
for an entire area saves a lot
of time on an emergency. Uh the

00:00:48.348-->00:00:53.253
most popular rapid entry system
is made by Knox and the Knox box
is mostly what I’ll focus on

00:00:53.253-->00:00:58.825
today. And a lot of places these
things are required by law on
commercial buildings. So you can

00:00:58.825-->00:01:02.763
have the best high security
locks in the world on your
doors. But you still have to put

00:01:02.763-->00:01:07.334
your keys in this metal box so
that firefighters can get in. Uh
sometimes these things even have

00:01:07.334-->00:01:12.406
alarm codes in them. They make
really big ones for commercial
buildings and tiny ones for

00:01:12.406-->00:01:16.810
people’s houses. Again same
idea, you put your keys in the
box and the firefighters can

00:01:16.810-->00:01:22.449
open the box. They also make
padlocks and key switches for
overriding gates and even boxes

00:01:22.449-->00:01:26.820
with circuit breakers inside.
And all of these devices take
the same keys, which are held by

00:01:26.820-->00:01:31.291
the local fire department.
Sometimes one fire department
will get their own unique Knox

00:01:31.291-->00:01:36.163
key and sometimes many
departments will share the same
system. Sometimes even an entire

00:01:36.163-->00:01:41.735
state will use a single Knox key
throughout. So this is basically
a physical backdoor to an entire

00:01:41.735-->00:01:46.873
city or even state. Bruce
Schneier referred to it as
physical key escrow and as I’m

00:01:46.873-->00:01:51.979
sure you all know by now, key
escrow isn’t really that great
for security. These are pretty

00:01:51.979-->00:01:56.516
powerful keys and as you can
probably imagine, it’s kind of
bad when they fall into the

00:01:56.516-->00:02:01.955
wrong hands. Here’s some footage
from a burglary in Seattle, this
guy walks up and starts messing

00:02:01.955-->00:02:06.560
with something on the wall and
then he comes back with someone
else and enters the code into

00:02:06.560-->00:02:10.864
their keypad that was supposed
to be reserved for the fire
department and they open the

00:02:10.864-->00:02:15.002
door, go in the building and
leave with some packages that
they were not supposed to leave

00:02:15.002-->00:02:20.774
with. Seattle then spent half a
million dollars to rekey their
Knox boxes. Something similar

00:02:20.774-->00:02:25.612
happened in Austin. Someone used
a Knox key to break into a
children’s hospital and steal 31

00:02:25.612-->00:02:31.151
thousand dollars. Austin then
spent 300 thousand dollars to
rekey their Knox boxes and one

00:02:31.151-->00:02:35.856
and a half million to make sure
it never happened again. They
also didn’t know how many Knox

00:02:35.856-->00:02:42.129
boxes they had in their city,
but they thought it was around
6-->000. Also Knox’s website seems

00:02:42.129-->00:02:46.633
to be claiming that only the
fire departments have these
keys. They got some videos on

00:02:46.633-->00:02:52.205
their website where people say
like, only the fire department
has access to that box. Or only

00:02:52.205-->00:02:57.210
we have a key to open it. And
I’m just not sure if that’s 100
percent accurate. I mean, this

00:02:59.513-->00:03:06.019
Phoenix fire department somehow
managed to lose 850 of these
keys. And they didn’t even

00:03:06.019-->00:03:11.391
notice until they counted them
after hearing about the
burglaries in Seattle. So who

00:03:11.391-->00:03:17.330
knows where they are. Uh, people
can also get in a lot of trouble
for refusing to install these

00:03:17.330-->00:03:22.102
things. There was an article
last year about a butcher from
Pennsylvania who didn’t want to

00:03:22.102-->00:03:27.207
install a Knox box because he
didn’t like the idea of giving
strangers access to his keys.

00:03:27.207-->00:03:32.079
The city threatened to put him
in jail for 30 days, fine him
1-->000 dollars and condemn his

00:03:32.079-->00:03:37.517
building as a fire hazard. So if
people are going to be forced to
use these, I think they have a

00:03:37.517-->00:03:41.288
right to know to know what’s
inside of them. A couple years
ago I got in touch with Knox to

00:03:41.288-->00:03:46.259
ask about the locks they’re
using and they pretty much told
me to pound sand. They did not

00:03:46.259-->00:03:52.966
want to talk to me at all. So
Knox boxes almost exclusively
use Medeco 72 series cam-loks.

00:03:52.966-->00:03:58.538
Older ones use the biaxial and
newer ones uses the M3. These
are really cool locks that work

00:03:58.538-->00:04:02.075
a little bit differently than
what most people are used to. I
don’t really have time to go

00:04:02.075-->00:04:06.446
into exactly like they work, but
basically the cuts on the key
can have different angles as

00:04:06.446-->00:04:10.951
well as depths. With the normal
key, the only thing that really
matters is how deep the cuts

00:04:10.951-->00:04:16.690
are, but with Medeco’s the angle
of the cuts is also important.
The key rotates the pins as well

00:04:16.690-->00:04:21.161
as lifting them up, so if you
look at a Medeco key from the
top down you can see that some

00:04:21.161-->00:04:25.799
of the cuts have been twisted
one way and some have been
twisted the other. They also

00:04:25.799-->00:04:29.936
don’t have any driver pins uh
this is what the key pins look
like and I think it’s a very

00:04:29.936-->00:04:35.976
clever design. These things are
physically very tough and the
lock is super hard to pick. It’s

00:04:35.976-->00:04:40.447
rated by UL to withstand many
different types of attacks for
30 minutes. I only know a

00:04:40.447-->00:04:45.485
handful of people who can pick
these things, but unfortunately
I don’t think they offer enough

00:04:45.485-->00:04:51.024
protection against of
unauthorized replication of
keys. Uh Knox is pretty serious

00:04:51.024-->00:04:55.428
about key control. Uh the keys
are supposed to be kept inside
these electronic boxes, which

00:04:55.428-->00:05:00.500
I’m sure are completely
unhackable. They’re also
connected to radio and wi-fi

00:05:00.500-->00:05:06.173
sometimes. Which is great, but
the firefighter has to enter a
pin in order to remove the key

00:05:06.173-->00:05:10.544
and it keeps track of when that
happens. So these are pretty
well protected. But even if

00:05:10.544-->00:05:15.482
someone has physical access to a
key for just a few seconds, they
can still gain a lot of useful

00:05:15.482-->00:05:20.220
information about it. Someone
can make measurements of it by
taking a clay impression or by

00:05:20.220-->00:05:26.359
using a key decoder or just a
photograph. You don’t even need
a good photo in 2008 some

00:05:26.359-->00:05:30.764
students at UC San Diego showed
that they were able to copy a
key that was photographed from

00:05:30.764-->00:05:35.602
around 200 feet away. And
sometimes it’s not even
necessary to take your own

00:05:35.602-->00:05:41.942
photo. After about 10 minutes of
searching on YouTube, I saw
several videos of people showing

00:05:41.942-->00:05:48.648
off Knox keys. It’s probably not
good that these keys are being
posted to the internet. A, a key

00:05:48.648-->00:05:53.720
is pretty much just a metal
password. Anyone who can read
it, can copy it. That being

00:05:53.720-->00:05:57.791
said, it’s not always easy to
replicate a Medeco key. You
wouldn’t just be able to get one

00:05:57.791-->00:06:02.162
copied at the hardware store
because they use special
restricted key blanks and only

00:06:02.162-->00:06:07.267
certain people are allowed to
make copies. But these keys are
just chunks of metal and with

00:06:07.267-->00:06:12.606
the right tools, any chunk of
metal can be reproduced. If you
already have the blank, you can

00:06:12.606-->00:06:18.445
make the cuts on the certain key
machines, or even just by hand
with the metal file. But getting

00:06:18.445-->00:06:23.516
restricted key blanks can be
kind of tricky. There are plenty
of ways to make key blanks

00:06:23.516-->00:06:29.389
though. For example, modifying
another similar blank until it
fits into the lock and there

00:06:29.389-->00:06:34.060
have been some attacks presented
at DefCon before. In some
situations you can make a key

00:06:34.060-->00:06:38.898
blank out of a thin piece of
metal or plastic, like a credit
card. Uh this will work if the

00:06:38.898-->00:06:44.804
keyway is wide open, but not so
much on the more paracentric key
ways. If you want to make a

00:06:44.804-->00:06:49.809
better blank, milling is a
pretty good way to go. CNC is
good, uh there are also mills

00:06:49.809-->00:06:53.980
built specifically for
duplicating key blanks, but they
are very expensive and have some

00:06:53.980-->00:06:59.819
drawbacks. If you don’t have
access to one, a good 3D printer
will work too. Cheap FDM

00:06:59.819-->00:07:04.357
printers are usually precise
enough to duplicate something
like a house key pretty easily,

00:07:04.357-->00:07:08.161
but with higher security locks,
sometimes you need more
precision to make a reliable

00:07:08.161-->00:07:12.966
key. SLA printers are really
good for this and shapeways has
some extremely precise

00:07:12.966-->00:07:17.337
materials. Shapeways is a
service that will 3D print
things for you. You just upload

00:07:17.337-->00:07:21.841
your file, choose your printer,
pay a couple bucks and they mail
it to you. I’ve tested most of

00:07:21.841-->00:07:27.781
their materials and I like their
MJF process the best. So I’ve
been wondering how hard it would

00:07:27.781-->00:07:32.886
be to print one of these keys
from scratch. It turns out it’s
really not that difficult. The

00:07:32.886-->00:07:37.424
printing is pretty easy, but the
real fun begins when you start
trying to model the key.

00:07:37.424-->00:07:42.228
Obviously I don’t have access to
the original key to begin with
and I can’t easily get a hold of

00:07:42.228-->00:07:46.933
one, I mean, all things
considered, I think Knox is
doing a pretty good job of key

00:07:46.933-->00:07:51.037
control. They’re using patent
protected keys, that are
slightly harder to duplicate

00:07:51.037-->00:07:56.443
with the normal keys and the
keys are kept in special boxes
and obviously they won’t just

00:07:56.443-->00:08:02.816
sell you the key, but what they
will sell you is the box and the
interesting thing is, the lock

00:08:02.816-->00:08:07.654
in the box contains all of the
information necessary to
reproduce the key. The lock and

00:08:07.654-->00:08:12.459
the key are pretty much mirror
images of each other. I mean, it
has to be this way because the

00:08:12.459-->00:08:17.397
lock has to somehow check if the
key is correct. There’s no
encryption, no challenge

00:08:17.397-->00:08:22.068
response, just some pieces of
metal interacting with each
other and they’ll sell one to

00:08:22.068-->00:08:27.707
anyone who wants to put one on
their building. So I bought one
to check it out. [laughter] It

00:08:27.707-->00:08:32.712
came with some cool documents
which I immediately ignored and
sure enough it shipped with the

00:08:35.749-->00:08:40.920
lock installed. These things
also ship open, so it’s really
easy to just unscrew the thing

00:08:40.920-->00:08:45.925
and pop the lock out. [applause]
So now I have the Knox lock for
my city and that means that I

00:08:52.599-->00:08:58.204
effectively have a negative
image of the Knox key for my
city. And so does everyone else

00:08:58.204-->00:09:02.642
who has one of the boxes. If I
can make a key to open my box,
then I would have a key to

00:09:02.642-->00:09:07.480
almost every commercial building
in my city. I didn’t really want
to mess with mine, so I bought

00:09:07.480-->00:09:12.485
some very similar locks on Ebay
and started trying to make a
model in OpenSCAD. It’s a 3D

00:09:14.788-->00:09:19.492
modeling tool where you define
your shape in a language similar
to C, but instead of compiling

00:09:19.492-->00:09:24.864
into a computer program, it
compiles into a shape and since
it’s completely parametric, it’s

00:09:24.864-->00:09:29.135
perfect for modeling things like
keys. Once you have your model
setup, if you want to change

00:09:29.135-->00:09:34.541
something, it’s as simple as
just updating some numbers and
recompiling. Uh I’m not the

00:09:34.541-->00:09:39.312
first one to use it to model
keys. Nirav Patel, Christian
Holler and Eric Van Albert have

00:09:39.312-->00:09:43.416
done that before, but I wanted
to try making my tool that
suited my needs a little bit

00:09:43.416-->00:09:48.988
better. So one of the first
challenges I ran into was
modeling the key way. Sometimes

00:09:48.988-->00:09:53.526
Medeco will remove a lot of
metal from the face of the plug
and this makes it kind of hard

00:09:53.526-->00:09:58.431
to get a good image of the key
way. Like if I try to scan or
photograph it, the wording is

00:09:58.431-->00:10:03.703
really hard to see because it
doesn’t start until about a few
millimeters back from the face.

00:10:03.703-->00:10:07.974
But a quick and dirty way around
that is to just slice the plug
in half and look at a cross

00:10:07.974-->00:10:12.779
section of it. You can just cut
it with a hacksaw or something.
It doesn’t really matter if it

00:10:12.779-->00:10:17.484
leaves a nasty, rough edge,
because you can just lap the
face until it’s perfectly even.

00:10:17.484-->00:10:21.654
And then if you polish it and
put it down a flatbed scanner,
you should get a pretty crisp

00:10:21.654-->00:10:26.459
image of the key way. The next
thing to consider is that this
cross section is not perfectly

00:10:26.459-->00:10:31.498
circular, we’re taking a cross
section of a cylinder and if the
face we’re scanning is not

00:10:31.498-->00:10:35.468
absolutely parallel with the
front and back of the plug, the
picture we’ll get will be

00:10:35.468-->00:10:39.839
slightly elliptical. This is
pretty easy to correct for
though. I made a program that

00:10:39.839-->00:10:45.678
just transforms the ellipse back
into a perfect circle. And then
once we have the image, we can

00:10:45.678-->00:10:51.217
bring it into Inkscape, trace it
and we have our profile and then
if we extrude that profile, we

00:10:51.217-->00:10:56.489
have a blank. Then also if you
didn’t thin the profile down at
all when you traced it, it

00:10:56.489-->00:11:01.294
probably won’t quite fit into
the lock. Maybe it wasn’t traced
properly or the image wasn’t

00:11:01.294-->00:11:06.032
completely accurate or the
printer wasn’t calibrated
properly so I recommend thinning

00:11:06.032-->00:11:10.303
the blank down a little bit to
give it some room. Uh you could
just try to eyeball it, but I

00:11:10.303-->00:11:14.374
made a program that lets you
print a bunch of keys all stuck
together like this and it

00:11:14.374-->00:11:19.445
smoothly changes the parameters
from one side to another. So you
can start it out thick on one

00:11:19.445-->00:11:23.883
side and have it get thinner
towards the other and then just
snap a part to see which one

00:11:23.883-->00:11:29.789
works the best. Uh and then to
model the cuts we can just take
the pins out and measure them.

00:11:29.789-->00:11:33.726
The key pins are kind of hard to
measure because they all have
the same height, so I recommend

00:11:33.726-->00:11:38.765
making a 3D printed measurement
tool. I’ll open source mine when
I’m done with it and you don’t

00:11:38.765-->00:11:43.202
have to be super precise when
measuring pins because you can
just compare your measurement to

00:11:43.202-->00:11:48.975
the closest one published by
Medeco. Also, the only
difference between a biaxial key

00:11:48.975-->00:11:53.813
and a M3 key is this groove
that’s been cut out of it so the
key can interact with the M3

00:11:53.813-->00:11:59.185
slider element. This element is
protected under patent, but it
would be trivially easy to print

00:11:59.185-->00:12:03.957
a key with a similar cutout.
This element does give the key
some legal protection against

00:12:03.957-->00:12:08.428
duplication, but it provides
almost zero technical
protection. And people have

00:12:08.428-->00:12:13.666
attacked this element at DefCon
before. It was shown to be very
secure as long as the attacker

00:12:13.666-->00:12:18.671
doesn’t have access to a paper
clip or something similar. Um.
[laughter] So after some

00:12:20.673-->00:12:25.678
tweaking and trial and error, I
was able to make a working
Medeco key [audio breaks]

00:12:29.115-->00:12:33.686
sticking out and it won’t go
back in unless the correct key
is in the lock and here it is

00:12:33.686-->00:12:37.590
with the correct key. It’s a
little, yeah. [applause] Um, so
that really wasn’t all that

00:12:37.590-->00:12:40.293
hard, uh the process would be
exactly the same to produce the
Knox key to my city. This means

00:12:40.293-->00:12:42.895
anyone who has access to one of
these locks and a good 3D
printer could produce one of

00:12:42.895-->00:12:46.165
these keys. Also, if someone
really wanted to get a hold of
one of these locks, they

00:12:46.165-->00:12:48.468
wouldn’t even need to buy one.
When these things are properly
installed, they’re really tough

00:12:48.468-->00:12:51.237
to remove if you don’t have the
key. Like, good luck getting
that thing off. But they’re not

00:12:51.237-->00:12:53.539
always properly installed.
[laughter] Here’s a Knox box on
a chain link fence, so anyone

00:12:53.539-->00:12:56.743
with some wire cutters could
take that thing. Let’s see. It
would also probably be pretty

00:12:56.743-->00:13:03.516
easy to take one of the
padlocks, if someone had some
bolt cutters or lock picks. It

00:13:03.516-->00:13:08.521
would be pretty hard to pick the
Knox padlock, but what about
that other lock. What if someone

00:13:23.503-->00:13:28.508
just left one open? That lock is
available to anyone that has
access to a wrench or a pair of

00:13:36.582-->00:13:41.587
pliers. I took this photo about
8 months ago and it’s still like
this today. Uh I’m releasing the

00:13:43.756-->00:13:48.795
program I made for this. It’s on
GitHub right now. The repository
is called Gatekeyper. It’s a

00:13:48.795-->00:13:53.766
couple hundred lines of OpenSCAD
code designed to help make keys
for locks without requiring

00:13:53.766-->00:13:58.371
access to the original key to
begin with. It’s nice
necessarily for Medcos, but it

00:13:58.371-->00:14:03.042
can reproduce all of the
elements of a biaxial key.
Unfortunately I’m not releasing

00:14:03.042-->00:14:07.480
a version which can do this cut
out for the M3 slider, because
that’s still under patent and

00:14:07.480-->00:14:12.118
I’m not entirely sure if it will
do that, but some could modify
this program to include that

00:14:12.118-->00:14:18.191
characteristic. So check it out
if you’re interested, but please
don’t mess with locks that

00:14:18.191-->00:14:21.828
aren’t yours. I’m not talking
about this because I want people
to start breaking into

00:14:21.828-->00:14:26.199
buildings, I’m just trying to
show that these are a security
risk. I’m also not trying to

00:14:26.199-->00:14:30.803
talk trash about Medeco, I think
the M3 is a very nice lock. I
just don’t think it should be

00:14:30.803-->00:14:36.976
used for this application. So
how could we improve these? Knox
could try switching to a

00:14:36.976-->00:14:42.448
different mechanical lock, but
then people like me would just
do the same thing to that one.

00:14:42.448-->00:14:46.853
Uh there are some keys which are
a real pain in the a*s to
duplicate, like the multi-lock

00:14:46.853-->00:14:52.291
interactive or the Evva MCS, but
you’re never going to stop
people from recreating chunks of

00:14:52.291-->00:14:56.963
metal. I think the best way to
avoid this kind of attack would
be to avoid key escrow

00:14:56.963-->00:15:02.068
altogether. I think the biggest
flaw in the Knox system is that
all of the locks in each area

00:15:02.068-->00:15:07.039
are identical. I can reverse
engineer my Knox box and gain
useful information about my

00:15:07.039-->00:15:13.212
neighbor’s Knox box or the
hospital down the street or the
bank. Things might be more

00:15:13.212-->00:15:18.084
secure if we switched over to
electromechanical locks because
electronics let you make it very

00:15:18.084-->00:15:22.455
difficult to extract secret
information, since you have
challenge response and all that

00:15:22.455-->00:15:28.194
fun stuff. It took years for the
Desfire EV1 chip to get broken
by a differential power analysis

00:15:28.194-->00:15:33.633
attack. And that’s a lot longer
than it took me to make a Medeco
key, but the most secure way to

00:15:33.633-->00:15:38.404
do this would be not to store
any secret information in the
lock. Each lock could have its

00:15:38.404-->00:15:44.243
own unique credential. That way
if I reverse engineer my lock, I
would have no useful information

00:15:44.243-->00:15:49.248
about my neighbors credential
and I think that’s how it should
be. And it would be much harder

00:15:49.248-->00:15:54.854
to do stuff like this. Uh
there’s a very neat combination
lock called the RKS which is

00:15:54.854-->00:15:59.826
like a very tiny safelock that’s
dialed with a robotic key. Uh if
they use something like this,

00:15:59.826-->00:16:03.763
each building could have it’s
own unique combination and they
could just load them onto the

00:16:03.763-->00:16:10.036
key when they need to. Knox also
recently announced an electronic
of their product. Coincidentally

00:16:10.036-->00:16:12.672
they released the promotional
video for it. It’s a completely
electronic system, kind of like

00:16:12.672-->00:16:14.674
the Medeco XT. I don’t know how
they’re doing the electronics,
but they say the key can hold

00:16:14.674-->00:16:16.676
100 codes. That’s not very many,
so it leads me to believe that
they’re not doing away with key

00:16:16.676-->00:16:18.678
escrow altogether. Just making
it electronic. So you’re
probably wondering what if

00:16:18.678-->00:16:20.680
someone hacks the electronics?
Wouldn’t that be really bad?
Well, don’t worry, according to

00:16:20.680-->00:16:22.682
Knox, it cannot be hacked.
[laughter] They say it is a
completely hack proof system.

00:16:22.682-->00:16:27.687
They also say that it can’t be
hacked via RF or Bluetooth,
which kind if makes sense given

00:16:49.041-->00:16:55.915
the fact that it doesn’t use
either of those things.
[laughter] Um. But until we do

00:16:55.915-->00:17:00.887
get these 100 percent hack proof
locks, what can building owners
do to mitigate key duplication

00:17:00.887-->00:17:06.459
attacks? Knox does offer to sell
them with a tamper alert, which
is nice. Uh it’s got two

00:17:06.459-->00:17:11.063
buttons, one is detect the box
coming off of the wall and the
other is to detect the door

00:17:11.063-->00:17:15.268
being opened. You hook the up to
your burglar alarm so it can go
off if someone messes with the

00:17:15.268-->00:17:20.306
box. This is a nice feature, but
it’s almost never hooked up.
Pretty much nobody uses these

00:17:20.306-->00:17:25.177
things. They probably should
though. The tamper alert seems
to be pretty well designed, but

00:17:25.177-->00:17:30.182
on the residential 3200 model,
Knox was kind enough to include
a drain hole on the bottom. This

00:17:32.318-->00:17:36.289
allows me to just hold that
button down with a bent piece of
wire and defeat the tamper

00:17:36.289-->00:17:41.928
alert. Here’s what that looks
like from the inside. Here’s the
button and I go in and grab it

00:17:41.928-->00:17:47.800
and I can open the door and the
button stays down. And if I let
go, it pops back up. Knox’s

00:17:47.800-->00:17:52.571
website says that the tamper
alert provides highest security
and I really hope this isn’t the

00:17:52.571-->00:17:58.511
best they can do. Uh so if you
are using that switch, maybe
don’t get one with an exposed

00:17:58.511-->00:18:03.783
drain hole. Also, have cameras
pointed at the box, don’t rely
completely on locks for your

00:18:03.783-->00:18:09.255
security. Get an alarm and maybe
don’t put your alarm code in the
box. I know you’re supposed to

00:18:09.255-->00:18:13.960
but if your building is on fire
or something, I guess it’s not a
huge deal if your burglar alarm

00:18:13.960-->00:18:19.332
goes off. And as for long term
solutions, I think we should be
switching over to a system where

00:18:19.332-->00:18:24.670
this is just intrinsically not
an issue. I’m not saying this is
a huge issue, but just that we

00:18:24.670-->00:18:29.775
can do better going forward. If
you’re interested, check out the
GitHub page for helpful

00:18:29.775-->00:18:35.214
resources and programs I used.
Also, huge thanks to the
Electronic Frontier Foundation

00:18:35.214-->00:18:40.486
for answering some of my
questions about this. Please go
do- go donate to them. And thank

00:18:40.486-->00:18:45.491
you for listening. I hope you
found this interesting.
