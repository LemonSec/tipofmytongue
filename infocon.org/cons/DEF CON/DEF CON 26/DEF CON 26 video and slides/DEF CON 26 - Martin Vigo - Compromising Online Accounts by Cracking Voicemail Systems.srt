00:00:00.100-->00:00:05.105
>>Let’s get it started! Martin
Vigo! Give her a big hand! Let’s
go! [applause] >>[Clears throat]

00:00:07.674-->00:00:12.946
Alright. Hello. Thanks everyone
for coming to this talk. It was
supposed to be, uh, 45 minutes

00:00:12.946-->00:00:17.451
talk, so I can only be 20, and
going to go super, super fast
because I really want to cover,

00:00:17.451-->00:00:23.123
eh, the entire content. So my
name is Martin Vigo, I work as a
product security lead. I’m from

00:00:23.123-->00:00:26.393
Galicia, Spain. We got the best
seafood in the world. If you
don’t believe it, come over

00:00:26.393-->00:00:30.831
there to try it. I like
research, I like scuba, and I
don’t like that whisky, I like

00:00:30.831-->00:00:34.234
gin and tonics, in case you want
to come. We’ll ask questions
later. You know how to draw my

00:00:34.234-->00:00:39.306
attention. So, eh, let’s talk
about history. So we are going
to talk about voicemail systems.

00:00:39.306-->00:00:44.411
I like to move, and they don’t
have a wireless thing. Eh,
about, eh, voicemail systems,

00:00:44.411-->00:00:47.714
how to compromise them, right?
And the first thing when you do
research is you look up, eh,

00:00:47.714-->00:00:53.520
previous art. And in this case
it was really cool because I
just went back to the 80’s when

00:00:53.520-->00:00:58.125
the voicemail systems become
popular, and I started to read
articles and e-zines from the

00:00:58.125-->00:01:02.596
first hackers and freakers. It
was really, really good. So I
condensed everything that I

00:01:02.596-->00:01:07.968
learned in 5 quotes, 5
different, eh, e-zines. So here
we can see that it says, “You

00:01:07.968-->00:01:12.806
can just enter all 2-digit
combinations until you get the
right one. A more sophisticated

00:01:12.806-->00:01:17.844
and fast way to do this is to
take advantage of that fact that
such machines typically do not

00:01:17.844-->00:01:23.016
read 2 numbers at a time, and
discard them, but just look for
the correct sequence.” Actually,

00:01:23.016-->00:01:27.120
in this one in hacking AT&T
Answering Machines Quick and
Dirty, we can see the actual

00:01:27.120-->00:01:32.993
sequence that you can enter and
it would actually be the entire
2 PIN- 2 digit PIN key space.

00:01:32.993-->00:01:38.699
Because if you enter 1234 it
would actually parse 23 as well,
to look if it’s the correct PIN.

00:01:38.699-->00:01:44.404
In a tutorial for Aspen
Voicemail Systems, what we learn
is that was actually, eh,

00:01:44.404-->00:01:50.444
default passwords and there was
actually common patterns that
people used as PINs. And in the

00:01:50.444-->00:01:55.048
last one what we learn is that
“There is also the old ‘change
the message’ secret to make it

00:01:55.048-->00:01:59.119
say something to the effect of
‘This line accepts all toll
charges so you can bill third

00:01:59.119-->00:02:03.523
party calls to that number.’”
What that means is you will
basically record as the greeting

00:02:03.523-->00:02:07.861
message, “Yes, I accept,” and
then from the penitentiary you
will get basically free calls.

00:02:07.861-->00:02:14.067
So voicemail security in the
80’s, we can sum up as there was
default passwords, common

00:02:14.067-->00:02:17.938
passwords, bruteforceable
passwords, efficient ways to
bruteforce the pass, eh,

00:02:17.938-->00:02:23.043
passwords, and the greeting
message was an attack vector.
How about we play checklist?

00:02:23.043-->00:02:28.515
Fast forward to today, voicemail
security today, let’s do a
checklist. Default passwords

00:02:28.515-->00:02:32.486
check. According to the public
documentation in the form of
your carriers of the United

00:02:32.486-->00:02:37.657
States in their websites, AT&T
is 3, eh, 6 1’s, T-Mobile is the
last 4 digits of the phone

00:02:37.657-->00:02:42.729
number, Sprint is the last 7,
Verizon is the last 4. Common
passwords according to a

00:02:42.729-->00:02:48.135
fantastic research from 2012,
eh, from Data Genetics, eh,
there is a number of conclusions

00:02:48.135-->00:02:53.974
that they got to, but basically
some of the important was that
you have a 22% chance of

00:02:53.974-->00:02:58.979
guessing a 4-digit PIN by just
trying the top 20 PINs of the
10-->000 that are possible. So

00:03:01.548-->00:03:06.720
that means that 1 in every 4th
victim that you try by just
trying 20 PINs, you will

00:03:06.720-->00:03:11.725
actually get the right one.
Other conclusions include that
most of the PINs start by 19,

00:03:11.725-->00:03:16.663
and that’s because people tend
to use their birth year as the
PIN number. Bruteforceable

00:03:16.663-->00:03:22.736
passwords AT&T, T-Mobile,
Sprint, Verizon, they all allow
4-digit PIN codes. Efficient

00:03:22.736-->00:03:27.908
bruteforcing eh, it actually
allows to enter 3 PINs at a time
by using the pound to

00:03:27.908-->00:03:31.578
[unintelligible] it, which is
kind of like a return in a
voicemail system. And you don’t

00:03:31.578-->00:03:36.917
even have to wait for prompt of
error messages if the PIN was
wrong. So with all this in mind

00:03:36.917-->00:03:41.922
that I learned from the amazing
hackers from the 80s and my
tests today on the voicemail

00:03:41.922-->00:03:46.760
systems, I decided that I should
write a tool that actually takes
advantage of that and allows you

00:03:46.760-->00:03:52.499
to bruteforce voicemails, eh,
fast, cheap, easy, efficiently,
and undetected. So let’s look

00:03:52.499-->00:03:57.971
how. Fast I use Twilio, which is
uh, basically a voice service
that allows you programmatically

00:03:57.971-->00:04:03.743
to make phone calls, to make
hundreds of calls to the victim
and to try different PINs. It’s

00:04:03.743-->00:04:09.382
cheap the entire 4-digits
keyspace for less than $40. Or
if you want to have a 50% chance

00:04:09.382-->00:04:14.254
of actually guessing the correct
PIN, in a 4-digit one, it costs
you less than $5. But we can

00:04:14.254-->00:04:19.192
take a different approach. Why
don’t we try the default PINs
that we mentioned before on 1000

00:04:19.192-->00:04:24.998
different numbers. Remember, the
phone number is actually the PIN
code. So, that costs you $13.

00:04:24.998-->00:04:30.470
It’s easy it’s fully automated.
You pretty much provide the
victim’s voicemai- eh, voi- eh,

00:04:30.470-->00:04:35.242
phone number and some other
parameters, and that’s it.
You’re ready, configured, eh,

00:04:35.242-->00:04:40.380
specific payloads for the, for
the carriers. And it’s efficient
it optimizes bruteforcing, tries

00:04:40.380-->00:04:46.953
3 PINs at a time, and uses
existing research from Data
Genetics to favor the ones that

00:04:46.953-->00:04:50.991
are more common, to favor the
ones with birth years, and stuff
like that. But the most

00:04:50.991-->00:04:56.196
important thing is detection.
Because if you think about it,
if I as an attacker want to

00:04:56.196-->00:05:00.333
interact with your voicemail, I
need to call you, because if you
don’t pick up, then I can

00:05:00.333-->00:05:04.638
interact with your voicemail. So
that really sucks, because I
need to detect when your phone

00:05:04.638-->00:05:09.276
is offline. So what is the ways
to, that I can go straight to
your voicemail with my tool?

00:05:09.276-->00:05:13.947
When I started to look into
this, one of the things that I
try was to do several calls at

00:05:13.947-->00:05:18.385
the same time to kind of flood
the line, and we will work and
go straight to the voicemail.

00:05:18.385-->00:05:22.489
It's actually kind of like
slydial works, which is a
service for scammers and

00:05:22.489-->00:05:27.294
marketers to basically go
directly to your voicemail. Em,
you can call while the phone is

00:05:27.294-->00:05:31.631
online, and you can use OSINT
techniques for, eh, finding out
when someone has the phone

00:05:31.631-->00:05:35.802
offline. Everyone likes to tweet
when they takes a plane. Who
goes to Burning Man in 2 weeks?

00:05:35.802-->00:05:41.641
Yeah, you better guys stay ‘til
the end of the talk. Eh, you
have, eh, home, eh, home

00:05:41.641-->00:05:46.146
location records. Which it’s a
global, it’s a database that you
can queries if you pay a little

00:05:46.146-->00:05:50.217
bit of money, that, eh,among
other things, what it provides
you is actually if the phone is

00:05:50.217-->00:05:54.821
connected to a tower. I tried
it, it’s not very reliable, not
very realtime, so I had to find

00:05:54.821-->00:05:59.326
a way that was really good in
order to go straight to your
voicemail. And that’s when I

00:05:59.326-->00:06:03.597
found the concept of backdoor
voicemail numbers. So it turns
out that carriers think it’s a

00:06:03.597-->00:06:08.868
good idea to have a system that
you can dialing, put the number
you want to leave a message to,

00:06:08.868-->00:06:12.939
and then you leave the message,
so I don’t have to call you, I
call that service and provide

00:06:12.939-->00:06:18.511
your phone number. But you know,
when you press start, you access
the login prompt. And so that’s

00:06:18.511-->00:06:23.250
actually what the tool uses in
order to not have to have your
phone offline and be able to

00:06:23.250-->00:06:27.921
bruteforce passwords. So now,
voicemailcracker is undetected,
because I’m not even calling

00:06:27.921-->00:06:32.025
your phone. But the thing is, it
doesn’t have only that
advantage, turns out that during

00:06:32.025-->00:06:36.963
my tests, when I was calling
directly to the victim, every
4/5th call it would fail,

00:06:36.963-->00:06:42.302
because it can only take that
many calls, and the tool, like,
retries again. But when I tried

00:06:42.302-->00:06:45.505
with voice, eh, with backdoor
voicemail numbers, because they
are meant to be used by

00:06:45.505-->00:06:51.544
everyone, what happens is that
literally hundreds of call and
it never, never failed. Let’s do

00:06:51.544-->00:06:55.615
the first demo. Eh, in this
demo, what I want to do is
basically show you how the tool

00:06:55.615-->00:07:00.553
works. So what you see on the
left is the- is the victim’s
number, and I’m trying to see

00:07:04.157-->00:07:08.028
where to make this. So it’s the
victim’s number, and on the
right you see the tooling. In

00:07:08.028-->00:07:11.932
this case I’m using the
bruteforce option. And as you
can see, I provide the victim

00:07:11.932-->00:07:16.469
number, the type of carrier
because the task is specific
payload, and the caller ID,

00:07:16.469-->00:07:21.441
which actually Twilio provides
to you. And then I use the
option of backdoor, eh, number,

00:07:21.441-->00:07:25.979
right? So it doesn’t call the
victim. And if you see the last
option is top PINs, so I’m

00:07:25.979-->00:07:31.618
trying, based on the peer
research, the top 20 most common
PINs. Of course, the PIN is

00:07:31.618-->00:07:37.424
1983, that’s the Defcon’s team.
So what it’s doing now, it’s
making those calls. I mean, it

00:07:37.424-->00:07:42.362
can do hundreds of them, but for
damage purposes, I wanted to
make just the top 20. And just

00:07:42.362-->00:07:47.400
trying those PINs. It’s
interacting with the voicemail.
So, because it tries 3 at a

00:07:47.400-->00:07:52.739
time, you will find that first
it will gives you the possibly 1
of those 3 is the PIN, and then

00:07:52.739-->00:07:58.678
it will try individually those
PINs just to find out what is
the right one. And I wanted to

00:07:58.678-->00:08:03.450
fast forward this demo, I will
the other 2 that I have. But I
wanted to give you the feeling

00:08:03.450-->00:08:09.222
of how long it takes. And the
truth is it’s, it feels that it
takes too long for, eh, for just

00:08:09.222-->00:08:14.594
20 PINs, but think that in
reality, how do I find out if
the PIN is correct. People

00:08:14.594-->00:08:19.065
thought that I, that I use sound
processing just to figure out if
your errors out, but I do not,

00:08:19.065-->00:08:23.837
but I’m very lazy, so I do it
much harder. Eh, what I do is
the call duration, right? If you

00:08:23.837-->00:08:29.676
enter 3 PINs wrong, the call
will hang up. So that gives me
actually a pattern of the

00:08:29.676-->00:08:36.082
duration of the call. So with
Twilio I instructed to actually
wait 10 extra seconds. So all I

00:08:36.082-->00:08:41.087
got to do is wait for the thing
to login if it’s the thing is
correct it will wait 10 extra

00:08:43.556-->00:08:49.629
seconds. So because of the
duration of the call, I know
that that PIN is correct. So

00:08:49.629-->00:08:55.335
that’s what it’s doing right
now, that’s why it takes a
little longer. But when the,

00:08:55.335-->00:09:01.341
obviously when the, when you
don’t have the right PIN, it
will be much faster. And in

00:09:01.341-->00:09:08.114
3-2-1, it should tell us that
the PIN is, eh, 1983. I should
have them up shortly. There we

00:09:08.114-->00:09:14.320
go! Cool. So we see now, thank
you. [audience cheers] Eh, okay.
Alright. So we saw that, eh, we

00:09:14.320-->00:09:17.891
have a tool that we can use,
thousands of calls, very cheap
and all that. But what’s the

00:09:17.891-->00:09:22.128
impact, right? Why am I sitting
here with this? Who cares about
voicemails, right? Anyway, all

00:09:22.128-->00:09:27.500
the messages you guys probably
have is from marketers and
scammers. So why am I here?

00:09:27.500-->00:09:31.604
Well, the truth is there is much
more to it, right? A lot of
people doesn’t realize that you

00:09:31.604-->00:09:37.143
can reset passwords due to a
failure of verification over
automated phone calls. So my

00:09:37.143-->00:09:41.448
question to you is, what happens
if I have your email, go and
start a password reset over

00:09:41.448-->00:09:47.287
phone call so that it sends you
that code that usually sends
over SMS, and you don’t pick up?

00:09:47.287-->00:09:51.958
The voicemail will pick up and
will start recording. So now
that I can compromise your

00:09:51.958-->00:09:57.063
voicemail, all I have to do is
to initiate password resets, and
I will be able to listen how the

00:09:57.063-->00:10:02.235
recording spells out the code.
So the attack vector looks like,
the first thing you got to do is

00:10:02.235-->00:10:07.073
bruteforce the voicemail system,
ideally using backdoors as I
mentioned. Then for this one you

00:10:07.073-->00:10:11.611
need to ensure that the phone is
offline, and the reason is
because when I do the password

00:10:11.611-->00:10:15.782
reset, Paypal will call the
victim, not the backdoor number,
but it’s only for this single

00:10:15.782-->00:10:20.086
call. And you can use OSINT or
call flooding or whatever you
want. You start the password

00:10:20.086-->00:10:24.791
reset process, you release into
the recorded messaging, then you
got it. And the tool can do all

00:10:24.791-->00:10:29.796
of this for you automatically.
Let’s compromise WhatsApp. Close
this. Okay. So what you have on

00:10:40.940-->00:10:45.178
the left is the victim’s number,
is the victim’s phone, and what
you have on the right I actually

00:10:45.178-->00:10:48.982
did it with a simulator. It’s
not even actually a phone. I
downloaded the APK and put the

00:10:48.982-->00:10:53.486
800 in an emulator. So I open
the app, and it tells me, “Hey,
do you want to register?” Well

00:10:53.486-->00:10:57.590
no one has a username in
WhatsApp, right? You do that
with your phone number. So I

00:10:57.590-->00:11:02.495
entered the victim’s phone
number. And so what it’s going
to do, it’s going to send a text

00:11:02.495-->00:11:05.665
to the victim. So you are going
to see on the victim’s, eh,
phone number that I’m going to

00:11:05.665-->00:11:11.004
put it in airplane mode. And
that’s to simulate that the
victim is offline, because

00:11:11.004-->00:11:15.108
WhatsApp is obviously going to
try to call him. But in the case
specifically with WhatsApp, the

00:11:15.108-->00:11:19.412
first thing it does is to send a
text. So I’m not interested in
that, so I’m going to fast

00:11:19.412-->00:11:24.050
forward here, because it
basically waits a minute and
gives you the option to call.

00:11:24.050-->00:11:29.455
And so as you can see, I press
now the Call Me. So now WhatsApp
is just basically calling the

00:11:29.455-->00:11:34.861
victim who is offline, so the
voicemail will pick up. And now
what I’m doing is I’m using my

00:11:34.861-->00:11:40.033
tool with the option of message.
A message basically interacts
with the voicemail system to

00:11:40.033-->00:11:44.337
retrieve the newest message so
you don’t even have to do it.
It’s automatically. And you see

00:11:44.337-->00:11:49.943
that because I bruteforce it
before the PIN, now I provide it
as an option so it can log in,

00:11:49.943-->00:11:55.281
this option that we have here.
And so here is fast forwarding,
it’s basically interacting with

00:11:55.281-->00:12:00.019
the voicemail, it’s retrieving
it, and it will give you a URL,
and all you got to do is, eh,

00:12:00.019-->00:12:05.024
put it in a browser and you will
get another file. Ehm, we have
audio now. So I’m loading that,

00:12:09.829-->00:12:14.701
it gives you an audio file, and
it should be the newest message-
>>[audio file] Please- >> -the

00:12:14.701-->00:12:19.706
victim has. Now it’s interacting
with the voicemail system.
>>[audio file] New message.

00:12:21.975-->00:12:26.980
You’re verification code is
365915. You’re verification code
is 365915. Your verif- >> And

00:12:37.090-->00:12:41.461
that’s it. So now I’m going to
put, eh, [audience applauds]
[unintelligible] and that’s all

00:12:41.461-->00:12:47.100
it takes. And I want to mention
that WhatsApp has really, really
strong security so I’m not

00:12:47.100-->00:12:50.737
claiming, I mean there is things
like you won’t be able to see
the previous groups, but you

00:12:50.737-->00:12:54.407
could hold until someone writes,
and then you will be able to
interact. And then it’s also the

00:12:54.407-->00:12:58.444
fingerprinting all the stuff,
but this is a big problem
because you literally hijack

00:12:58.444-->00:13:03.383
that person’s WhatsApp. So let’s
go back to the slides. And then,
okay. Got to go really fast. We

00:13:08.388-->00:13:13.493
done? Not yet, because it turns
out that some people knows this,
and so what they did and what is

00:13:13.493-->00:13:18.064
recommended is to provide user
interaction, eh, based
protection. What does that mean?

00:13:18.064-->00:13:23.169
Some, the automated call will
not just spill the code, but it
will say press, “Please press

00:13:23.169-->00:13:27.607
any key”, or “Please press a
random key,” or “Please enter
the code.” It will show you in

00:13:27.607-->00:13:32.111
the UI, this Paypal does this,
it will show you in the UI a
code, and you will have to enter

00:13:32.111-->00:13:36.983
it in the keypad when you
receive the call. So, can we
beat this recommended

00:13:36.983-->00:13:41.721
protection? This is what is
recommended today when you read
the articles. And we’re going to

00:13:41.721-->00:13:46.359
play a game. We’re going to
guess it together. And I gives
you the first hint. Everyone

00:13:46.359-->00:13:51.364
probably what this is. So this
generates some really nice, eh,
DTMF kind of taunts that was

00:13:54.967-->00:13:59.872
used by Jon Draper, eh, for
doing, eh, good stuff in the
80’s. And this is the second

00:13:59.872-->00:14:04.577
one. I actually cheated when I
looked at the, at the checklist,
right? I told you we were going

00:14:04.577-->00:14:08.181
to cover them all, but we didn’t
cover that the greeting message,
something we learned from the

00:14:08.181-->00:14:13.920
80’s, is actually an attack
vector. So when people, this is
why it’s so important for you

00:14:13.920-->00:14:18.725
hackers, you guys are amazing
because we want to, we want to
understand how the system works,

00:14:18.725-->00:14:22.462
right? If you ask someone what
is, to explain to you this user
interaction protection, will

00:14:22.462-->00:14:28.267
tell you, “Oh, you have to press
a key.” No. They system is
waiting to hear a specific

00:14:28.267-->00:14:34.574
frequency, a specific DTMF tone,
not that you physically press a
key. And that’s the thing. So

00:14:34.574-->00:14:40.179
what we can do is we can record
DTMF tones that represent the
codes that its expecting the

00:14:40.179-->00:14:45.718
automated calls as the greeting
message. And it works every
single time. Attack vector

00:14:45.718-->00:14:50.623
exactly the same. We just add
now as a second step that you
update the greeting message with

00:14:50.623-->00:14:56.095
the DTFM tones, and again, the
tool will do all this
automatically for you. Let’s

00:14:56.095-->00:15:01.033
compromise Paypal. Okay, you see
on the left, eh, that, eh, I
bruteforce the PIN. On the right

00:15:09.375-->00:15:13.980
you see that I need the email,
so I will just, eh, start the
password reset. And in this

00:15:13.980-->00:15:20.052
case, it will actually show me a
code that I’m supposed to enter
when I receive the phone call,

00:15:20.052-->00:15:24.624
right? I’m just basically just
picking here that I want, eh, to
receive the password over

00:15:24.624-->00:15:31.063
automated phone call. And as you
can see, on the left, I’m going
to use the option of greeting.

00:15:31.063-->00:15:35.868
And this is what allows you to
change the greeting message. And
I made it very verbose, in this

00:15:35.868-->00:15:41.641
case for the demo, and so you
see the last parameter is Paypal
called. So all I have to do is

00:15:41.641-->00:15:47.079
to put the 6353 there, and the
tool will interact with the
voicemail, change the greeting

00:15:47.079-->00:15:52.084
message, put DMTF tones that
represent 6353, and if
everything works, I mean the

00:15:54.153-->00:15:59.559
demo’s recorded, eh, [audience
laughs] then we should see that,
eh, we actually compromised

00:15:59.559-->00:16:04.063
Paypal. So we are going to, so
actually Paypal is already
making the call, but I don’t

00:16:04.063-->00:16:07.233
care because it takes a little
bit to change the greeting
message. I just click ‘Call me

00:16:07.233-->00:16:12.238
again,’ right? So we fast
forward a little bit. I got 5
minutes. Okay, I can do this.

00:16:14.507-->00:16:19.512
And in 3-2-1, boom, there it is.
We just compromised Paypal.
[Audience applauds] Thank you.

00:16:27.053-->00:16:30.590
Okay, very quick. What services
are, you’re going to need to pay
attention, I’m going to run over

00:16:30.590-->00:16:35.728
this. This is a small subset,
Alexa top 100, not favorite or
anything, but password reset for

00:16:35.728-->00:16:41.200
Paypal, Instagram, Netflix,
ebay, LinkedIn, 2FA, the big 4-
Apple, Google, Microsoft, Yahoo,

00:16:41.200-->00:16:46.272
verification- WhatsApp, Signal.
Twilio’s a good one, because
Twilio allows you to verify a

00:16:46.272-->00:16:51.344
caller ID so I can literally own
your caller ID and make calls on
behalf of you. Google Voice is

00:16:51.344-->00:16:54.914
used for scamming, but you need
to tie it to a real phone
number. So I can get unlimited

00:16:54.914-->00:17:00.987
Voltron phone numbers by just
verifying someone else’s phone.
But the best one is consent.

00:17:00.987-->00:17:06.259
When we think about consent, we
think about lawyers, about
signing papers. It turns out

00:17:06.259-->00:17:10.863
Location Smart, which was in the
news 4 months ago, I think,
because, eh, Brian Crebs wrote

00:17:10.863-->00:17:16.469
an amazing article about it, is
basically a service that has
agreements with the carriers to

00:17:16.469-->00:17:21.474
be able to track you for, eh,
24/7 if you provide consent- by
pressing 1. [Audience laughs]

00:17:25.244-->00:17:30.249
Open source so the truth is, eh,
I obviously did, eh, eh,
responsible disclosure, and

00:17:33.152-->00:17:39.225
carriers are slow to catch up.
Some of them didn’t answer. I
also talked to the services. So

00:17:39.225-->00:17:43.029
releasing this tool will only be
a script kitting tool, but at
the same time I don’t want to

00:17:43.029-->00:17:47.967
claim stuff here that you can’t
verify. So basically what I do
is a voicemail automator

00:17:47.967-->00:17:53.539
instead. So I’m going to publish
this code on Monday, because the
weekend is- I’m going to

00:17:53.539-->00:17:58.444
celebrate. So it’s basically I
removed the bruteforcing. Why?
Because this way I didn’t give

00:17:58.444-->00:18:03.916
you code to compromise any-
anyone’s, eh, voicemail number,
but you will be able to try it

00:18:03.916-->00:18:09.155
on your voicemail number what
I’m claiming here. And you can
go to the github repo.

00:18:09.155-->00:18:13.659
Recommendations. Very quick. Eh,
for online services, don’t use
automated calls for security

00:18:13.659-->00:18:18.531
purposes, nor SMS. Feel free to
check out a BSides talk I gave
that is kind of related to this

00:18:18.531-->00:18:23.669
but for SMS. Eh, if not
possible, well, detecting an
answering machine is tough, eh,

00:18:23.669-->00:18:29.575
but require user interaction. I
just show you how to bypass
that, but that is with the hope

00:18:29.575-->00:18:34.814
the carriers listen and ban DTMF
tones from the greeting message.
This is the most important

00:18:34.814-->00:18:39.418
slide. For carriers out there.
Ban DTMF tones from the greeting
message. Eliminate backdoor

00:18:39.418-->00:18:44.590
voicemail systems or at least do
not allow access to the login
prompt by just pressing star.

00:18:44.590-->00:18:50.363
Voicemails should be disabled by
default and can only be
activated from the phone itself.

00:18:50.363-->00:18:56.635
I was able to activate phone
numbers by activating the victim
never- the victim- the person

00:18:56.635-->00:19:03.242
that allowed me to test it.
[Audience laughs] Eh, I was able
to set a password for them. No

00:19:03.242-->00:19:07.880
default PIN, don’t allow common
PINs, detect abuse. Is this
being recorded? No, it’s too

00:19:07.880-->00:19:11.350
late now. [Audience laughs]
Don’t abuse bruteforce attempts,
and don’t process multiple PINs

00:19:11.350-->00:19:16.455
at once. I got 2 minutes.
Recommendations for you guys
disable voicemail, or at least

00:19:16.455-->00:19:20.292
use the longest, eh, possible
PIN. Don’t provide the phone
number, unless obviously it’s

00:19:20.292-->00:19:24.664
the only way to get 2FA. But you
can use a virtual number because
you can, you know, get rid of

00:19:24.664-->00:19:30.036
things like OSINT, eh, to figure
out your phone, or like SIM
swapping, and when you use 2FA,

00:19:30.036-->00:19:36.008
try to use apps. I like always
to put a slide just to kind of
do a too long, didn’t read

00:19:36.008-->00:19:40.413
somewhere, right, left, that
says, “Automated phone calls are
a common solution for password

00:19:40.413-->00:19:45.418
reset, 2FA, and verification
services, and consent. Eh, these
can be compromised by leveraging

00:19:47.753-->00:19:54.360
old weaknesses and current
technology to exploit the
weakest link, voicemail systems.

00:19:54.360-->00:19:59.365
Thank you so much for attending.
[Audience cheers] I did it!
