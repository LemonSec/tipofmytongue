00:00:00.167-->00:00:05.172
>>Who is excited for the last 2
hour talk of the day! [cheers
from audience] These guys have

00:00:08.675-->00:00:13.680
some awesome things they’re
gonna show and and girl [laughs]
so um with no further delay

00:00:21.655-->00:00:27.761
please give a warm welcome to
Sven, Till and Snuggy presenting
uh at DefCon 26, Inside the Fake

00:00:27.761-->00:00:32.766
Science Factory! [cheers from
audience] oh yeah and if one
falls over the other one because

00:00:38.005-->00:00:43.010
of lav mics um um I'll help them
up but uh yeah let's let's get
you guys untangled first. Give

00:00:55.255-->00:01:00.193
them another round of applause!
[cheers from audience] >>So hi
DefCon, hi everyone thanks for

00:01:05.532-->00:01:09.469
having us! This is amazing this
is such an honor to speak in
front of such a great audience

00:01:09.469-->00:01:14.708
here and my name is Till, Till
Krause Simon reporter and
investigative journalist from

00:01:14.708-->00:01:20.113
Süddeutsche Zeitung Germany,
Süddeutsche Zeitung magazine, a
big magazine from the German

00:01:20.113-->00:01:26.820
newspaper, glad to be here
today. >>My name, thanks, my
name is Svea I'm also an

00:01:26.820-->00:01:31.825
investigative reporter from
Germany's biggest broadcaster
ARD and the reason why or one

00:01:34.761-->00:01:40.467
reason why we are here and why
we’re real really excited to be
here is the whole research you

00:01:40.467-->00:01:45.472
going to see now started right
here at DefCon.This is for us
also kind of a way of saying

00:01:48.041-->00:01:53.046
thank you DefCon because of what
this conference make possible.
And it started because last year

00:01:55.949-->00:02:00.887
I had a talk here and I met
Chris. >>Hi I’m Chris, is this
mic working? How about now? I

00:02:04.591-->00:02:09.596
have done same thing last year,
I should learn. I'm Chris also
answer to Sophie I work for the

00:02:13.100-->00:02:19.539
online privacy foundation and
I'm also a member of the DefCon
CFP review board. I didn't vote

00:02:19.539-->00:02:24.544
on my own talk. Honestly. >>So
to get you started this is gonna
be a really long talk but it's

00:02:29.416-->00:02:34.054
basically divided into 2 parts.
So what we’re gonna do now is
give you the presentation and

00:02:34.054-->00:02:38.291
have a little bit of time for
questions and answers and then
you’re in for a treat because

00:02:38.291-->00:02:42.329
we’re going to show you a
documentary film that we made
about the subject matter we are

00:02:42.329-->00:02:48.301
talking about. So you’ll be will
be well entertained I think, I
hope, and after this

00:02:48.301-->00:02:52.506
documentary, we’ll still have
time for questions and answers.
And if you guys want to know

00:02:52.506-->00:02:58.245
anything more that we’re talking
about, we’re here to answer your
questions. And before we totally

00:02:58.245-->00:03:04.651
dive into this Fake Science
Factory what would does it even
mean, so we will talk today

00:03:04.651-->00:03:09.656
about something at that pretends
to be science but in fact is
just bogus or you can just call

00:03:11.691-->00:03:16.697
it Bullsh*t sometimes. So and in
order to understand how
important it is, let’s think a

00:03:18.799-->00:03:25.172
little about what science means
for society. So when you talk
about science, it's not just

00:03:25.172-->00:03:30.410
about academics working in ivory
towers doing research. the
results really influence the

00:03:30.410-->00:03:35.348
world how we see the world our
perception of the world what
kind of things we buy what

00:03:35.348-->00:03:39.119
medications we take how
political decisions are
influenced a lot of this is

00:03:39.119-->00:03:44.958
based on science and this makes
it really important that science
is actually working the whole

00:03:44.958-->00:03:49.963
process of scientific
publications. >>so about a year
ago I was a fairly far along

00:03:54.768-->00:04:01.141
with some research and with the
research I wanted to present an
abstract and some preliminary

00:04:01.141-->00:04:06.713
findings at conference, so I
found this one, The 19th
International Conference on

00:04:06.713-->00:04:12.819
Political Psychology, submitted
an abstract, we got accepted,
we’re pretty delighted with

00:04:12.819-->00:04:18.792
that. And that’s a phase and
standard thing to do in academia
so that you can discuss your

00:04:18.792-->00:04:24.731
results with peers and not form
the rest of your decision on how
you write the rest of the paper.

00:04:24.731-->00:04:29.736
So off we went to Copenhagen
Denmark in October last year
excited about the conference you

00:04:32.105-->00:04:38.078
and I kind of brickin it about
presentation and this was the
conference [audience laughter].

00:04:38.078-->00:04:43.984
Not not a room in the
conference. That’s the
conference [audience laughter].

00:04:43.984-->00:04:48.989
And the all attendees
[inaudible] I just thought well
maybe that's like an admin or

00:04:52.292-->00:04:58.832
something .but then talk started
I'm and bury in mind of that I
submitted on Political

00:04:58.832-->00:05:04.271
Psychology, the talks before
mine were on Urban planning,
Advance Islamic Finance, I’m not

00:05:04.271-->00:05:10.677
even sure if what that really is
robotics in farming. All sorts
of things, you know, get there,

00:05:10.677-->00:05:16.850
they say okay you got five
minutes to present, five
minutes, before they said it was

00:05:16.850-->00:05:22.189
20 minutes see you now you got
that 5 all of a sudden you
thinking this is a little bit

00:05:22.189-->00:05:27.194
weird what the f*ck [ audience
laughter]. so this sort of
shenanigans is actually got a

00:05:30.063-->00:05:36.670
name as I found out on the sore
Schmoke that goes to the sort
places apparently and his called

00:05:36.670-->00:05:42.509
predatory publishing and Tills
is going to talk to us a little
bit more about that >>So

00:05:42.509-->00:05:48.215
predatory publishing what is
this so we tried to nail it down
to some sort of a formula based

00:05:48.215-->00:05:53.220
on Albert Einstein euro is MC
Square so this means that what
predatory publishers are doing

00:05:55.689-->00:06:01.394
is they take something that is
either scientific like your talk
or something that is utterly non

00:06:01.394-->00:06:07.334
scientific they mix it all
together to make a lot of money
and there's a definition for

00:06:07.334-->00:06:12.372
this of course so this is this
is kind of a broader results
sociological problem at where

00:06:12.372-->00:06:17.510
you say that those meetings are
set up to appear, appear as if
they are science. But they’re

00:06:17.510-->00:06:23.750
not. Because nobody is actually
really looking at that.What
people are publishing there. So

00:06:23.750-->00:06:29.556
my question to you guys would be
who here is either scientist or
has the scientific background in

00:06:29.556-->00:06:34.661
a little bit above that let's
have a show of hands alright
that's quite a few people but

00:06:34.661-->00:06:40.033
for the rest of us I just give
you a very brief tour of how
publications and the scientific

00:06:40.033-->00:06:46.373
will usually works. On a good
academic journal you have an
idea for a paper you submitted

00:06:46.373-->00:06:51.945
and added her checks in and
could either rejected
straightaway or sends it to a

00:06:51.945-->00:06:56.850
process that is called peer
review . A peer review is
something were other scientists

00:06:56.850-->00:07:01.755
all the researchers who have
some knowledge in that field,
look at your manuscript and make

00:07:01.755-->00:07:06.426
suggestions. They look if the
methodology is okay, is the data
set is okay, are the conclusions

00:07:06.426-->00:07:12.766
in any way coherent and they
read the paper, they make
suggestions and they can again

00:07:12.766-->00:07:18.171
rejected straight away and if
does not make any sense or they
have it for revision and a

00:07:18.171-->00:07:22.075
friend of mine who’s scientist
states he calls the peer review
up a big pain in the a*s

00:07:22.075-->00:07:26.813
basically because people always
have some suggestions and and
it's a very very long and

00:07:26.813-->00:07:32.285
painful process it can it can
take months so it goes back and
forth you can have resubmitted,

00:07:32.285-->00:07:35.955
another peer reviewed and
another possibility of
rejection, but then in the end

00:07:35.955-->00:07:42.429
after a long time it gets
accepted. A little disclaimer
here. A peer review process as

00:07:42.429-->00:07:48.702
we know it from the big journals
of either open source on the
internet or printed journals it

00:07:48.702-->00:07:55.475
is not the perfect process.
Sometimes weird papers could
slip through the companies who

00:07:55.475-->00:08:00.080
run those big publications,
there’s a big monopoly here, a
lot of money to be made so this

00:08:00.080-->00:08:05.085
is not a perfect system. But the
whole idea of other scientists
reviewing manuscripts still is

00:08:07.420-->00:08:13.293
kinda the gold standard for
academic publishing. So when we
look at the predatory journals,

00:08:13.293-->00:08:18.064
things look a bit different so
the only thing they have in
common is there is submission so

00:08:18.064-->00:08:20.066
somebody submits a paper there
and then there’s superficial
comments if at all. Then you

00:08:20.066-->00:08:23.103
have to make a payment and then
its acceptance. So quite easy
right? so in the end in order to

00:08:23.103-->00:08:25.972
two to understand what we're
talking about here we have to
make clear and there are

00:08:25.972-->00:08:30.977
hundreds if not thousands of
predatory publishers out there
little bit like this Nigerian

00:08:41.388-->00:08:46.126
email scam that you guys
probably know a lot about yeah
they sent emails in bulk trying

00:08:46.126-->00:08:51.131
to recruit authors, people send
their manuscripts there and we
looked at the 5 major companies

00:08:53.700-->00:08:59.205
behind them, one of them is
WASET where we presented, OMICS
is one the one from India so

00:08:59.205-->00:09:03.276
those are the ones were were a
lot of journals are published
they have a lot of conference

00:09:03.276-->00:09:08.915
going on so this other major
players in this field. >>So
after finding out about this

00:09:08.915-->00:09:12.919
whole predatory publishing thing
I wanted the 2 things, wanted
the 450 Euros back and I mean

00:09:12.919-->00:09:14.921
that the 450 Euros things is
pretty standard if you’ve been
like an IEEE conference you have

00:09:14.921-->00:09:16.923
to pay for attendance I didn't
spots anything there. that but
more importantly I wanted my

00:09:16.923-->00:09:21.928
intellectual property back if
anybody is written an abstract
its kinda pain in the a*s, it

00:09:32.505-->00:09:37.610
takes a long time. So having to
rewrite it so it doesn’t fall of
prey of some sort of plagiarism

00:09:37.610-->00:09:42.615
engine is a bit of a frustrating
thing , so I asked WASET for my
money back and then withdraw the

00:09:46.686-->00:09:51.691
paper and they were like, No,
You signed the forms, here they
are. So you know, I have to you

00:09:56.095-->00:10:01.601
know I have to how to then go to
the credit card company and
explain what a predatory

00:10:01.601-->00:10:07.006
conference was that’s not that
easy. So you went to a
conference,yes but it wasn't

00:10:07.006-->00:10:12.011
really conference.Right, but
there was a conference. Sort of.
I have to write a detailed

00:10:14.280-->00:10:20.386
description for that also to
send to the UK fraud authorities
kind of explain what was going

00:10:20.386-->00:10:26.326
on and if I can get my money
back. I took all the information
I’ve written up and put it in a

00:10:26.326-->00:10:31.364
wordpress site at
waserwatchdotwordpressdotcom am
I also found all the authors

00:10:31.364-->00:10:35.401
that we're going to be attending
in the next 12 months and email
to all of those folks that were

00:10:35.401-->00:10:40.273
from universities and said hey
you might be going to er a
sh*tty conference. I also

00:10:40.273-->00:10:45.278
created a twitter account WASET
watch to warn people talking
about waset. I also pinged Svea

00:10:49.015-->00:10:54.020
who I met last year here in
DefCon and said this. >>And yes,
this is exactly the message I

00:10:57.490-->00:11:02.762
receive I would say don't mess
with him because he knows me
>>I'm badass [laughter] on

00:11:02.762-->00:11:05.999
Saturdays >>and this is where
the story begins with the whole
investigation. So we decided as

00:11:05.999-->00:11:10.503
a media organization dive into
it, to go on research this as
deep as we could and really kind

00:11:10.503-->00:11:13.106
of rip them apart. So I teamed
up with TIll with also another
good colleague of mine in which

00:11:13.106-->00:11:15.108
all together we’re quite a big
investigator and research
corporation Germany and one of

00:11:15.108-->00:11:17.110
the first thing we thought we
should do was we needed some
help.I don’t know who saw my

00:11:17.110-->00:11:19.112
talk last year, I love to dress
up, and we needed some
help[laughter] and my alter ego

00:11:19.112-->00:11:21.114
was Isabella Stein and we
decided to become scientist. And
Isabella Stein is from a small

00:11:21.114-->00:11:26.119
university of Himiltfrotin its a
village in Germany and I know a
couple of hundreds people living

00:11:55.515-->00:12:00.453
there and we believe that Santa
Claus is coming from there. So
it was Isabella Stein pictures

00:12:05.024-->00:12:10.029
from her university and also
together with my colleague we
submitted a fake paper this.

00:12:30.149-->00:12:35.154
This paper was randomly
generated by a computer
algorithm[laughter from the

00:12:40.627-->00:12:45.632
audience and speaker]. >>Oh
there’s more >>I'm sure I'm sure
you all get that right? This is

00:12:54.641-->00:12:59.646
a very neat neat program you can
find it on the web its called
SCIGEN and some MIT students

00:13:01.781-->00:13:07.820
invented this program, you just
have to type in your name, your
features name and then a paper

00:13:07.820-->00:13:13.493
jumps out. And this was the one
when we typed in our future's
name and this is the one paper

00:13:13.493-->00:13:18.498
which came out. So fake paper
number one a sting operation we
decided to go to the same

00:13:21.668-->00:13:26.673
conference people where Chris
was a they call themselves WASET
World Academy of Science

00:13:32.078-->00:13:37.583
Engineering and Technology and
we hardly believe our self when
they invited us for the

00:13:37.583-->00:13:42.588
conference [laughter] . so went
to London in January and
presented yeah let's see how

00:13:50.463-->00:13:55.468
Isabella Stein and Christian
Schreibaumer, and we really
we've read it out loud[Audience

00:13:58.037-->00:14:02.975
laughter]. Let’s see if we get
it running. Yes the first one.
It's a edited a little bit.

00:14:16.122-->00:14:20.460
(00:14:14) [Video started
playing with SUBTITLES]
Introduce as shortly this is my

00:14:20.460-->00:14:25.565
colleague Isabella Stein, from
our university of applied
Sciences. You see here now, is

00:14:25.565-->00:14:31.370
the relationship between our
solution and the analyst of the
memory bus- this is the memory

00:14:31.370-->00:14:36.375
bus- and here on the bottom and
on the top and all of this. This
investigation lead to the theory

00:14:38.611-->00:14:44.584
of red-black trees but we
propose a novel solution. We
used a 90’s Nintendo Game

00:14:44.584-->00:14:49.589
Boy[laughter] across the sensor
network[laughter]. Which means
the more pressure you give on

00:14:56.295-->00:15:01.234
the system, the higher
scalability gets, that’s what we
wanted to achieve. [laughter]

00:15:07.940-->00:15:12.945
You all know this: A single
particle is a reflection of
quantum potentiality [laughter]

00:15:20.586-->00:15:25.591
its from greek philosopher
Plato. Thank you [laughter]
[cheers from audience] >>sorry

00:15:31.397-->00:15:36.402
user error. [cheers from
audience]. >>thank you guys. The
hardest part was really not to

00:15:44.911-->00:15:49.916
laugh and [laughter] I have to
admit after our little theatre
we nearly ran out the room and

00:15:52.251-->00:15:57.256
to the next room and we couldn’t
stop it for a while.[laughter]
So but I mean it's funny but on

00:16:00.026-->00:16:05.264
the other hand it's sad at once.
Everybody applauded. I think
everybody was very polite.

00:16:05.264-->00:16:09.569
Polite people, polite
scientists. But also they were
no computer experts, there was

00:16:09.569-->00:16:11.771
probably a chemist or biologist
or a film critics person so they
couldn’t know about we were

00:16:11.771-->00:16:16.776
speaking and this is also the
reason why these conferences are
[inaudible] (00:16:27) I don’t

00:16:28.221-->00:16:33.226
want to spoil that one
[laughter][cheers from audience]
So, this one is the organizer,

00:16:46.372-->00:16:51.377
this was the only person there
who was from the world academy
of science and technology and

00:16:57.149-->00:17:02.088
that I asked him who are you
what's your name and he bailed
you did not want to answer

00:17:04.090-->00:17:10.396
mumbled something like I'm only
student from Cyprus and I don’t
know anything about this

00:17:10.396-->00:17:15.401
sentence so we kind of stopped
here in London because we could
not find out who was that guy

00:17:19.739-->00:17:24.744
and who’s behind WASET and this
was a time where we needed some
help more from other person dive

00:17:30.416-->00:17:35.421
deeper. >>So I called a friend
of mine Andrew McPherson and
Andrew Mcpherson like employee

00:17:38.891-->00:17:45.598
number one of Paterva who make
Maltego. I don’t know if you’ve
head of maltego it's kind of a

00:17:45.598-->00:17:51.170
tool for exploring relationships
in technical and non technical
context. It's pretty awesome.

00:17:51.170-->00:17:55.608
And the creator of Maltego
created this graphic for us
because he was pretty excited by

00:17:55.608-->00:18:00.546
the talk too So to find out a
little bit more about who’s
behind this WASETdotorganization

00:18:02.815-->00:18:07.820
we put this into a [inaudible
00:18:04] in this occasion. And
we wanted transform that shows

00:18:10.423-->00:18:16.228
entries from who is. And we
found out that WASETdotorg was
using a cloudflare which is you

00:18:16.228-->00:18:21.233
know a little bit of pain
because it was a little bit of a
dead end. But not really a pain

00:18:23.869-->00:18:30.276
because of what we found that
WASETdotorg was using the same
tracking cookie as iustdotorg,

00:18:30.276-->00:18:35.982
iastdogorg and wasetdotcom. And
then if we look at the IP
ownership for those guys we see

00:18:35.982-->00:18:40.987
links to a guy called Bora
Ardil. Bora Ardil is a guy the
“student there” that Svea met in

00:18:45.958-->00:18:50.963
London. Bora Ardell also posted
some PHPfreaks under the name of
the alias of plodos and you can

00:18:56.369-->00:19:01.340
get some interesting information
about this sort of the structure
of the WASET organization by

00:19:01.340-->00:19:06.345
some of his posts on phpfreaks
so back to Maltego looking at
the WHOIS information Will says

00:19:09.415-->00:19:14.420
see that that if we look at the
iustdotorg practice some million
times it references a gentleman

00:19:19.158-->00:19:24.997
called Cemal Ardil I'm not sure
from pronouncing that right but
this is the guy here. It comes

00:19:24.997-->00:19:31.837
out really sort of a top of the
tree for WASETdotorg,
WASETdotorg is a family business

00:19:31.837-->00:19:38.277
he's Bora’s father and as a Nova
Ardill as well as l this will
involve three of them we think.

00:19:38.277-->00:19:44.550
if we look at Bora he’s also a
registered at some “conference”
he typed DNS name 83 in total

00:19:44.550-->00:19:49.555
like Conference University and
Scientific Conference and stuff
like that. So in total WASET it

00:19:51.991-->00:19:56.996
host about 13 events and 13
different cities each month so
they’re quite busy 5000

00:20:00.332-->00:20:05.337
conference conference titles a
month a year that's 157 events
48 cities 35 countries and

00:20:08.808-->00:20:13.813
53,467 conference titles in
total. anything you can think of
and if it's not there is an

00:20:17.349-->00:20:22.354
opportunity to suggest one so we
estimated based on about 20 to
25 submissions per of Events

00:20:25.991-->00:20:32.932
that they’re making their annual
revenues about 3.8 million a
year or about 4.5 million US

00:20:32.932-->00:20:39.205
dollars.Even if there’s
overheads for the hotel rooms
and they don’t necessarily need

00:20:39.205-->00:20:44.210
to book the hotel conference
room. They lasted 2 whole hours
even if it cost them 2 million

00:20:47.513-->00:20:53.552
that's quite a lot of revenue
profit the that they’re making
from from this and this is just

00:20:53.552-->00:20:58.557
WASET. Oh yeah, another video.
>>yeah we of course try to speak
with them about this so we went

00:21:05.064-->00:21:09.101
to another conference in Berlin
but this time [video played mid
sentence] >>We have several

00:21:09.101-->00:21:14.106
questions for you. Is this
science? Do you call this a
scientific conference, what is

00:21:20.045-->00:21:25.050
scientific about this
conference? Let me call a
lawyer. >>this was the end of

00:21:41.433-->00:21:46.438
it. We got thrown out. We didn’t
get any answers from them until
today so the only answers, the

00:21:50.442-->00:21:55.447
only information we have are the
informations we have from Chris.
>>Ok so after this encounter

00:21:57.750-->00:22:02.988
with these weird people . this
weird conferences we really
thought okay let’s look deeper

00:22:02.988-->00:22:07.793
to what’s really going on there
we know that a lot of those
conference organizers also have

00:22:07.793-->00:22:14.300
big publication arms where they
publish journals and scientific
articles. So we thought okay. If

00:22:14.300-->00:22:19.138
they accept any computer
generated nonsense, and you have
a good laugh at that because you

00:22:19.138-->00:22:25.711
obviously able to see what kind
of crap that was and let’s try
to put it on to the next level .

00:22:25.711-->00:22:27.713
let’s try to a scientific
article published in one of
their journals . so we really

00:22:27.713-->00:22:29.715
try to think what would the bad
guys do. We invented a cancer
cure, complete nonsense and have

00:22:29.715-->00:22:34.720
the goal to have it published in
one of their journals. So that
we could say that this is a

00:22:46.265-->00:22:52.671
scientifically proven medication
that we can sell in the
internet. Because who would buy

00:22:52.671-->00:22:56.642
a random medication from the
internet when you can buy one
that says it was proven by

00:22:56.642-->00:23:02.348
scientist by a peer review
journal. So what we did. For
some reasons we like bees.

00:23:02.348-->00:23:08.787
Because bees are awesome,can
bees cure cancer? Probably not,
but Who knows right? In the

00:23:08.787-->00:23:14.627
world of scientific publications
that are fake, anything is
possible. So we invented another

00:23:14.627-->00:23:18.931
institution, the IFABIR
Institution. We made a twitter
account and a website. And the

00:23:18.931-->00:23:22.901
twitter account logo actually is
the German symbol for recycling.
[laughter] So this is for the

00:23:22.901-->00:23:28.741
trash that we’re gonna put out
to the world and the ceo of this
is Dr. Richard Funden which in

00:23:28.741-->00:23:33.746
German means invented. So the
whole thing was pretty bad. We
submitted a paper to one of the

00:23:38.284-->00:23:40.286
journals from omics which is one
of the biggest companies in that
field. The Journal of

00:23:40.286-->00:23:45.291
Integrative Oncology, looks
legit on the very first glance
so we wrote a paper saying that

00:23:53.832-->00:23:58.771
the wax that the bees produce
can have a better effect on
cancer treatment than

00:23:58.771-->00:24:04.376
chemotherapy. We just said that
right, there was no proof we
said oh yeah we have some

00:24:04.376-->00:24:10.349
patients and ask them as long as
we wanted until they said yeah
we feel better. This is our

00:24:10.349-->00:24:15.354
Methodology. We made some
outrageous claims for example,
one of the reasons why bees

00:24:19.358-->00:24:24.363
might be a good therapy options
for treating cancer is that
because bees don’t have cancer.

00:24:26.699-->00:24:31.704
Right? Makes perfect sense. And
the other argument we had was
general nature of bees, you know

00:24:34.840-->00:24:40.179
how they fly around those are
really happy animals. That
pretty much suggest that they’re

00:24:40.179-->00:24:46.218
probably treat cancer and we
even , because we are scientists
we quoted a book. We just didn’t

00:24:46.218-->00:24:51.623
say that bees have very very
happy in nature, we looked it up
on the book an quoted them on

00:24:51.623-->00:24:57.129
the reference section the only
problem is. Its a children's
book [applause] [speaker laughs]

00:24:57.129-->00:25:02.067
We really try to make it low
state so that anybody not like a
nobel prize winning scientist to

00:25:09.274-->00:25:14.413
find out that this is utterly
nonsense. But guess what
happened. After a couple of

00:25:14.413-->00:25:18.684
days, we got review comments
back from the publishers that
said o yeah this provides

00:25:18.684-->00:25:23.822
important experimental and
preclinical evidences there was
no evidence at all. It was all

00:25:23.822-->00:25:29.361
completely invented they have
some minor corrections that they
didn’t understand and

00:25:29.361-->00:25:33.632
abbreviations what sitf means
which is not hard that they
didn’t understand because we

00:25:33.632-->00:25:39.805
just made it up so we said oh
yeah. Sitf stands for signal
inferred transfer protocol. And

00:25:39.805-->00:25:45.144
they say oh sure! Yeah okay, and
we got an email around 10 days
after we handed them the

00:25:45.144-->00:25:52.084
manuscript and paper was
accepted and published and they
wanted to have 2000 Euros or 2.5

00:25:52.084-->00:25:56.455
thousand US dollars in
publication fee which we never
paid and they still published

00:25:56.455-->00:26:02.761
the paper. So it was online
there and it doesn’t stop there.
After a while, while the paper

00:26:02.761-->00:26:07.633
is online, we received several
emails from other predatory
publishers inviting us to be

00:26:07.633-->00:26:13.872
editors at cancer journals and
one email that I put up on
screen here we got invited to be

00:26:13.872-->00:26:20.345
keynote speakers at the breast
cancer conference in Paris, so
what a career right? We just

00:26:20.345-->00:26:25.250
invented this whole operations
and within 2 weeks we have a
scientific publication that we

00:26:25.250-->00:26:29.621
can put on the web saying this
is officially peer reviewed we
were able to speak at a

00:26:29.621-->00:26:35.194
conference and we’re editors of
journals. If we really have a
plan to sell this fake

00:26:35.194-->00:26:40.899
medication we would have some
arguments now. And to sound
funny at first, believe us we

00:26:40.899-->00:26:47.106
had a lot of fun doing this but
it's really serious. Because
it's not just something we made

00:26:47.106-->00:26:49.107
up. This is something that is
happening. >>so there are
various medications or alleged

00:26:49.107-->00:26:51.109
medications outhere that which
are proven in this journals for
example, it did not took us a

00:26:51.109-->00:26:53.111
long time to find gcmaf. Gcmaf
suppose to help against class h
cancer and a variety of other

00:26:53.111-->00:26:55.113
illnesses you may have and it is
something that you take it and
your immune system get strong

00:26:55.113-->00:26:57.116
that cancer is being so they
advertise with this studies
quite often. We’ll show you a

00:26:57.116-->00:27:01.520
short glimpse of the what you
can do with these studies.[Video
starts to play] >>300 Scientists

00:27:01.520-->00:27:06.992
from eight nations have written
180 studies about GcMAF. We
wrote 32 of them. >>Yes this is

00:27:06.992-->00:27:12.798
advertisement that will play,
and now you can now see
testimonials from this companies

00:27:12.798-->00:27:17.302
[While video still playing] >>I
took the GcMAF twice a week, and
after 3 weeks, I felt less

00:27:17.302-->00:27:21.173
tired. >>It isn’t something
that’s just quackery, it’s
scientifically backed [end of

00:27:21.173-->00:27:26.612
video] >>so we will now have a
short little look into the
studies >>It's a good

00:27:26.612-->00:27:31.617
advertisement you see it for at
least a couple of times
[laughter] >>Ithink you get the

00:27:38.824-->00:27:43.829
idea, this is what makes the
whole fake science operations so
dangerous that people can

00:27:51.403-->00:27:56.408
actually sit in front of a
camera and say this is not just
quackery it's scientifically

00:28:00.979-->00:28:05.984
backed. Let’s be honest, who
really has background to double
check all those studies right?

00:28:09.021-->00:28:14.026
>>Here you can see some of the
studies from these company and
this studies they are in the

00:28:17.863-->00:28:23.769
journal where Till submitted the
Bee wax paper. Others are we
submitted computer generated

00:28:23.769-->00:28:30.542
fake paper, you have no peer
review or some fake peer review
because this is the only reason

00:28:30.542-->00:28:35.547
why this papers get published.
So what we did was we show this
studies to well known oncologist

00:28:40.018-->00:28:45.023
in germany and she reviewed the
studies for 2nd time, and said
these studies was terrible and a

00:28:49.528-->00:28:54.533
normal person can’t see it. And
even doctors if not very
familiar with it, even a doctor

00:30:01.199-->00:30:06.204
can’t see it. Because these
studies they only take care
single cases for example they

00:30:26.024-->00:30:32.130
are not scientific at all and
they should have not been
published in real journal at

00:30:32.130-->00:30:37.369
all. Her conclusion was that
these studies only exist in the
internet page where these

00:30:37.369-->00:30:41.006
products are sold can link to
this scientific articles and
this is bad specially for the

00:30:41.006-->00:30:44.976
patients when they are very ill
and searching hopelessly for a
miracle for some cure, this is

00:30:44.976-->00:30:49.981
sort of a way these how studies
are spreading over social media
and over other medias and

00:30:54.619-->00:30:59.624
articles. It also took us not
long to find somebody who also
spread the word. This is a very

00:31:12.170-->00:31:17.175
beloved Tv host from Germany she
died in 2016 because she was
severely ill, she has breast

00:31:19.644-->00:31:24.649
cancer in the last stage. And
she wrote a book and this book
she really spoke very

00:31:27.452-->00:31:34.092
advertising and well about GCMAF
and that this is her last hope.
We also spoke to her best friend

00:31:34.092-->00:31:40.599
and she told us that this was
her last hope. This medication
and she was nobody who believed

00:31:40.599-->00:31:45.570
in some wonder healer or
something, she believed them
because the studies because she

00:31:45.570-->00:31:50.575
read them by herself. She died
and on this case you really can
see that this is a business with

00:31:55.280-->00:32:01.987
last hopes and these people were
publishing fake studies, they
are making money with the hopes

00:32:01.987-->00:32:08.660
of dying people. Usually there
are no consequences and this
case luckily there are when

00:32:08.660-->00:32:13.665
company is selling the stuff
that is going to trial in
London, November and the files

00:32:15.967-->00:32:22.774
alleged that they illegally sold
GcMAF as a Cancer drug. Based on
false studies. We also tried to

00:32:22.774-->00:32:24.776
reach out to them but our
questions were ignored. What’s
the matter with all of these.

00:32:24.776-->00:32:26.778
Many snake oil sellers, can use
this and they can sell these
stuff, we found plenty of other

00:32:26.778-->00:32:28.780
medications like some very stem
cell therapies which can’t be
working or some bio energy

00:32:28.780-->00:32:30.782
healer who has 150 studies. Who
heals with his energy. There's
plenty of them out there and

00:32:30.782-->00:32:32.784
they can sell products because
of these predatory publishers.
This was another reason for us

00:32:32.784-->00:32:34.786
to build a bigger picture. We
wanted to know who else is there
and the first step was to write

00:32:34.786-->00:32:37.823
as much fake papers as we could
and get them accepted and in the
end 12 different publisher

00:32:37.823-->00:32:43.428
>>This one is mine [laughter]
[inaudible](00:33:28) >>We got a
real scientist here right?

00:32:43.428-->00:32:48.333
[applause] [speaker laughs]
>>Thank you >>To be honest, 2 or
3 papers did not get accepted so

00:32:48.333-->00:32:54.306
that works as well. One wrote
back to us, this is meaningless
do something better in the

00:32:54.306-->00:32:59.311
future. We felt some didn’t
accept it but the absolute
majority of the accepted the

00:33:50.562-->00:33:55.567
paper without any comments.
>>After we asked these
publishers why did you accept

00:33:57.669-->00:34:02.741
these, why are you predatory,
most of them answers no comment,
some said no we are not

00:34:02.741-->00:34:09.514
predatory publisher, even if
they accepted papers form us or
this one I like the most it

00:34:09.514-->00:34:12.117
says, We are a platform so we
are not responsible. We wanted
to go and dig deeper. >>To

00:34:12.117-->00:34:14.119
gather some information from the
various predatory journals we
started scraping and analyzing

00:34:14.119-->00:34:16.121
one of those. We started with
scraping, we divided into 2
sections. 1st is look at he

00:34:16.121-->00:34:18.123
abstract of the papers submitted
and the information that goes
with those. And the other thing

00:34:18.123-->00:34:23.128
we want to do was look at all
the conferences and where they
are and how frequent they were.

00:34:46.785-->00:34:52.557
So the first step is we did a
site recon, for this example we
did look at WASET really quick

00:34:52.557-->00:34:58.530
we get some idea of the site
layout. Set out spiders to and
what we want to scrape and later

00:34:58.530-->00:35:03.468
pass so you see the papers in
the abstracts are listed here in
link for more detail. And here

00:35:05.570-->00:35:10.575
you see the author name, the
journal title, things like that.
And also you get this unique

00:35:14.512-->00:35:19.517
number identifier for the
abstract they range from about 0
to 100-->000. I write a messy

00:35:23.121-->00:35:28.126
Python to just look through all
of those and download the html
files of which there are 53-->069

00:35:30.695-->00:35:35.700
for WASET and then pulled out
the metadata title author date
journal name, stuff like that,

00:35:39.838-->00:35:44.843
attach that all to a csv file.
There's no real magic there. It
was straight forward. There are

00:35:47.645-->00:35:52.650
certain abstractdotcsv file had
all the things we just saw the
paper id the, author, direct

00:35:56.855-->00:36:01.793
download link to the pdf version
of the abstract for the paper.
Those pdfs contained more

00:36:06.031-->00:36:11.036
information such as institution
and their email addresses. We
pulled down the pdf, used pdf to

00:36:15.240-->00:36:20.245
text and used the information
for abstractsdotcsv as well.
Others on the team preferred

00:36:23.314-->00:36:28.319
more elegant approach using
scrapy for example doing sort
spidering more than one and you

00:36:31.956-->00:36:36.961
get sort of json file out of it.
Next moving on to conferences
real quick. There are 50

00:36:40.498-->00:36:45.503
different talk or conference
areas within WASET and each of
them are linked to hundreds of

00:36:47.906-->00:36:54.379
together collectively thousands
of conference titles, 50 subject
areas and here we see one

00:36:54.379-->00:36:59.717
subject area and that's just
small snippets of the different
conferences in that subject area

00:36:59.717-->00:37:05.723
in August 2018 and the reason
why they all have those
abbreviations you know, IC, I

00:37:05.723-->00:37:10.728
something that's done in
purpose, legitimate scientific
conferences usually go with

00:37:12.797-->00:37:19.437
those acronyms so what WASET did
is that they change one of the
letters around so they sound

00:37:19.437-->00:37:24.309
almost the original conference,
but not quite. This trick people
into believing oh I’m going to a

00:37:24.309-->00:37:29.080
very reputable conference, where
its just as valuable as a gucci
bag ripped with one seam. You

00:37:29.080-->00:37:34.085
could have been in this
conference we chose to come to
DefCon [laughter] just finished

00:37:41.059-->00:37:47.232
in Vancouver, apparently they
had since one a lot of the
attendees the penny drop form.

00:37:47.232-->00:37:52.237
That was a little bit backlash
there apparently. Altogether
44,476 different conference

00:37:55.607-->00:37:59.978
titles you can select.There’s
gonna be one for you. And if
you’re the kind of person that

00:37:59.978-->00:38:04.916
likes to plan in advance
[laughter] take note. And look
at all the cities you can travel

00:38:08.853-->00:38:13.858
to. You’ll get a receipt and
attendance vouchers and all of
that sort of stuff. 2031. So we

00:38:16.895-->00:38:21.900
take what we did to WASET and
applied that to all of the 5
predatory publishers we look at,

00:38:23.968-->00:38:28.973
we have the JSONS files the CSV
files and we use a collection of
tools to do various different

00:38:32.076-->00:38:37.081
analysis depending who we were
and what we were looking for.
Excel, Tableau, you can get 15

00:38:39.350-->00:38:45.323
day license or trial license for
that, Neo4j for graph
visualization and Linkurious and

00:38:45.323-->00:38:50.328
R&Python as well. So I want to
analyzing the data that we
downloaded. >>Yes it felt like

00:38:53.565-->00:39:00.038
lowering a curtain like looking
behind the scene because after
the scraping process,we could

00:39:00.038-->00:39:05.043
finally say, ok, this is how big
you are this his how many
abstracts you have. We wanted to

00:39:08.279-->00:39:13.284
know how many authors, so we
found nearly 180-->000 abstracts
and nearly 400-->000 authors

00:39:18.156-->00:39:23.161
contributing to this scam
worldwide. This maybe some
people will say oh my god,

00:39:27.832-->00:39:32.837
science in danger? No, this is
if you compared to the total
numbers of scientists will reach

00:39:37.208-->00:39:42.213
only 8 million scientists
worldwide, it is still a small
proportion so most of the

00:39:44.482-->00:39:50.221
scientists are publishing in
regular journals open access
journals or paper journals and

00:39:50.221-->00:39:55.226
only a very small proportion
fell for this scam, but the
developments is quite

00:39:57.428-->00:40:03.201
interesting. You see here that
specially with big ones all
mixed with WASET that they have

00:40:03.201-->00:40:08.206
had quite an increase especially
in the last 3 to 5 years they’re
getting bigger and bigger making

00:40:11.409-->00:40:18.416
more money and many people out
there are saying that this is a
problem in lower income

00:40:18.416-->00:40:23.421
countries, no its not. The US is
the 2nd biggest contributor to
this conference specially mixed

00:40:27.425-->00:40:33.898
with nearly 10-->000 abstracts and
what is interesting if you dive
deeper into the data and if

00:40:33.898-->00:40:38.903
you’re searching for
universities or when you are
looking for who is contributing

00:40:38.903-->00:40:43.908
to them this goes in every
field, there’s nearly no
university you won't find there.

00:40:45.944-->00:40:50.948
Even elite Universities have
published there over the past 10
years I have to admit so one can

00:40:54.819-->00:40:59.824
say one okay this is not too
much but anyway this number we
pulled out of the metadata from

00:41:03.594-->00:41:08.599
the paper also here at DefCon
specially top US institution
list also out of interest

00:41:11.869-->00:41:18.109
because they want to know which
universities are on top of this
list is this institution is the

00:41:18.109-->00:41:22.747
Mayo Clinic I think it's a
pretty well known institution,
University of Michigan, Wayne

00:41:22.747-->00:41:27.752
State University, I wrote all of
the universities you can read
here email asked for their

00:41:29.787-->00:41:36.561
comment most of them did not
comment on this issue, some did.
One here I want to read so they

00:41:36.561-->00:41:41.566
are really dismayed about this
they were kinda concerned when I
talked to them on the phone,

00:41:46.671-->00:41:52.343
they were like OMG we did not
know this, we did not like this
that our scientists are

00:41:52.343-->00:41:57.382
publishing there and they want
to take care and they want to
take action to stop this and

00:41:57.382-->00:42:02.320
they want to inform their people
about this so most interesting
is what are the reasons why

00:42:05.590-->00:42:10.595
scientists do this. First of all
scientists got scammed we were
talking about the nigeria scam,

00:42:13.331-->00:42:18.436
this is they’re sending spam
emails and you fell for it
accidentally and then you go

00:42:18.436-->00:42:23.441
there once, and you see okay
this is cr*p, you won't go there
twice. Also there's the Publish

00:42:26.177-->00:42:32.984
perish in academia so probably
some people choose the easy way
because of the just fast to

00:42:32.984-->00:42:37.989
publish there and the 3rd case
and want to go a little bit
deeper because this is for us

00:42:40.491-->00:42:45.163
the most interesting case when
scientists are taking advantage
of this predatory publishing. We

00:42:45.163-->00:42:50.201
were lucky to find one case
where the investigation ongoing
so this is from CUNY City

00:42:50.201-->00:42:55.206
University of New York and there
are quite some professors who
really like predatory

00:43:07.385-->00:43:13.324
publishers, they don't publish
there once or twice, no no no,
they publish there quite number

00:43:13.324-->00:43:19.697
of times so what you find in
these papers when you print them
out, that there’s some kind of

00:43:19.697-->00:43:24.702
office filing you find that to
15 offices for one paper which
is not normal then all of these

00:43:28.005-->00:43:33.111
papers are grant funded this is
usually tax money in these
papers. A lot these papers are

00:43:33.111-->00:43:35.213
copy paste so if you ran this
through a software you really
see that there's a lot of copy

00:43:35.213-->00:43:40.218
paste going on and if you take
them to scientist to do peer
review what we did then they

00:43:50.027-->00:43:52.897
told us ok some of this are
scientifically questionable
because probably they were

00:43:52.897-->00:43:54.899
written in a very short time. We
were lucky to have had a
whistleblower who was familiar

00:43:54.899-->00:43:56.901
with this case, which is the
CUNY case and he told us that
professors can benefit from

00:43:56.901-->00:44:02.273
getting higher salaries and
promotions because they probably
have some legit papers from good

00:44:02.273-->00:44:07.278
journals, they can just fill it
up with this cheap publications
they can also can obtain other

00:44:28.132-->00:44:33.137
benefits and this was the reason
why this could be the reason why
this is so like for like some

00:44:37.642-->00:44:42.647
minority of people and which we
find interesting is that even if
you do this knowingly or

00:44:44.715-->00:44:50.821
unknowingly, it doesn’t really
matter because of feeding the
system with this. The predatory

00:44:50.821-->00:44:57.194
publishers they get the money
from the universities, this is
one thing, and they can grow

00:44:57.194-->00:45:02.934
with their business model and
the other thing is they get the
reputation of the universities,

00:45:02.934-->00:45:07.038
they can advertise with people
from Stanford are publishing
here or people from Harvard are

00:45:07.038-->00:45:09.040
publishing here so even if the
scientists don't know, even if
they do this unknowingly, they

00:45:09.040-->00:45:14.045
are helping the predatory
publishing and they are helping
different group where no more

00:45:19.150-->00:45:24.155
than bad >>when we looked at
this we thought well, this goes
beyond academia right, so its

00:45:28.826-->00:45:35.800
one thing if professors try to
polish their publication list
and get more money maybe or have

00:45:35.800-->00:45:40.805
bad reputation but this whole
businesses can be used for all
kinds of purposes because we as

00:45:43.140-->00:45:48.045
a society we still have this
kind of feeling that if
something is scientifically

00:45:48.045-->00:45:52.817
proven its kinda valuable and
this is great that this is the
case because usually science

00:45:52.817-->00:45:57.722
does exactly that, but in the
case of the predators it is
quite different. We only not

00:45:57.722-->00:46:02.994
look at the academics were doing
there but we looked what are the
companies and lobby groups and

00:46:02.994-->00:46:08.099
political influencers are doing
there, because in the end, big
companies and big corporations

00:46:08.099-->00:46:13.437
have research and development
department where they present
their own research and the new

00:46:13.437-->00:46:19.176
product and this kind of things.
And oftentimes what they find is
not really scientifically sound

00:46:19.176-->00:46:24.181
but good enough for the
predators. So one big branch of
course the tobacco industry,

00:46:26.450-->00:46:32.056
they have a reputation, I think
most of you guys you know about
this they have a reputation for

00:46:32.056-->00:46:38.295
deceiving the public for
decades. Trying to downplay the
danger of secondhand smoking or

00:46:38.295-->00:46:43.200
the dangers of smoking
altogether you probably know
that spiel right? O well cancer

00:46:43.200-->00:46:48.172
has many reasons smoking maybe
one and maybe not, I don’t know
let's leave. You know that’s

00:46:48.172-->00:46:52.710
kind of what they do sometimes
and so what they do now
particularly for the Philip

00:46:52.710-->00:46:55.813
Morris’ companies that we found
that quite often the producers
of Marlboro you probably know

00:46:55.813-->00:46:59.483
them, they start to revamp their
businesses a little bit by
selling e-cigarettes potentially

00:46:59.483-->00:47:04.422
less harmful as they claim, they
have scientists writing about
this and where does the

00:47:07.191-->00:47:14.065
sometimes end, sometimes at the
predatory publishers so they
have those well looking

00:47:14.065-->00:47:19.070
brochures they hand out to
investors and to the public what
they make their health claims

00:47:21.205-->00:47:26.811
and list the articles here as
peer reviewed as they are from
WASET and they are published in

00:47:26.811-->00:47:31.348
WASET and we know what WASET is
right we got a best presentation
for reading a computer generated

00:47:31.348-->00:47:36.353
nonsense paper there so well not
reputable I guess. This is not
just a one time shot, Philip

00:47:38.589-->00:47:43.127
Morris seems to be a quite good
customers for them, they publish
all kinds of studies in those

00:47:43.127-->00:47:48.699
non peer reviewed journals that
claimed to have a peer review
they go to conferences present

00:47:48.699-->00:47:53.370
their research there and
particularly for the tobacco
industry its interesting because

00:47:53.370-->00:47:57.942
for some serious academic
conferences they are banned,
they are not even allowed to go

00:47:57.942-->00:48:01.846
there because of their history
in deceiving the public, they
are in the blacklist so they

00:48:01.846-->00:48:07.351
just it seems they found another
way to disseminate their
research to kind of boost their

00:48:07.351-->00:48:12.890
reputation. Who else is there,
Pharmaceutical companies the
Pharma giant Bayer from Germany

00:48:12.890-->00:48:17.628
inventor of aspirin they
published there quite a few
papers and one of them is

00:48:17.628-->00:48:22.867
actually interesting because one
of them has actually something
to do with aspirin. They

00:48:22.867-->00:48:26.904
flagship product because they
want to sell different
variations of aspirin they have

00:48:26.904-->00:48:31.709
come up with aspirins plus C
which is basically normally just
aspirin with vitamin plus C

00:48:31.709-->00:48:37.548
added they have a paper here
claiming that it help against
the common cold whereas many of

00:48:37.548-->00:48:42.553
the scientists we showed the
paper say, this is not really a
legitimate claim the German

00:48:42.553-->00:48:47.091
consumer protection agency
actually says that the addition
of vitamin C doesn’t make any

00:48:47.091-->00:48:53.297
sense but you can sell it for a
higher price. So if you are a
consumer and you want to find

00:48:53.297-->00:48:57.935
out well there's a normal
aspirin and there's this aspirin
plus C you probably go to the

00:48:57.935-->00:49:04.675
internet look at what the
benefit are and you end up here.
If you google aspirin plus C the

00:49:04.675-->00:49:10.347
omics paper and thats keep in
mind this is not peer reviewed.
This is just any study can be

00:49:10.347-->00:49:16.887
published there is on the second
rank on google. I think now with
you guys looking it up, and

00:49:16.887-->00:49:22.726
clicking on the link you can
actually make it rise to the top
so that’s a collateral damage of

00:49:22.726-->00:49:27.731
a talk like this but well let's
give it to bayer, they can have
it okay, so I think you

00:49:30.134-->00:49:34.939
understand what's going on here.
Other companies Mallinckrodt
very controversial company

00:49:34.939-->00:49:39.944
that's just recently fined $100M
for absurd and obscene prices
for their medications they

00:49:43.981-->00:49:50.154
published about their
medications there. AstraZeneca’s
doing it. Lobby groups ILSI

00:49:50.154-->00:49:55.092
Europe a think tank funded by a
Coca Cola, Hershey’s and
Kelloggs, they sent their

00:49:55.092-->00:50:00.397
scientist to conferences
speaking about childhood obesity
and nutrition and guess what it

00:50:00.397-->00:50:05.402
was not about salad right. So
they use this kind of forum to
disseminate their research what

00:50:08.339-->00:50:12.743
else did we found. We were kind
of a run ride, we were typing in
all the companies so we found

00:50:12.743-->00:50:17.781
critical infrastructures
framatome, a company that’s
responsible for nuclear safety

00:50:17.781-->00:50:22.786
they publish things there at
WASET again, the company we just
saw and it just goes on and on.

00:50:25.723-->00:50:30.728
Institutions from Germany
basically tax payers money, goes
up and present their stuff there

00:50:32.763-->00:50:38.202
and once you publish the
scientific publication, it just
doesn’t end there you know so it

00:50:38.202-->00:50:44.909
cited on other publication and
other people cited it cited in
patents for example for making

00:50:44.909-->00:50:50.147
patents for other medical
products they cite WASET
publications there and what we

00:50:50.147-->00:50:56.387
found particularly disturbing
there's this whole group of
climate change deniers, the Co2

00:50:56.387-->00:51:01.892
Coalition here in the United
States, very very controversial
people, you got EIKE institution

00:51:01.892-->00:51:06.664
on Germany that is a
scientifically working together
with German writing party AFD

00:51:06.664-->00:51:12.903
they speak in front of
parliaments in Germany actually
presenting view that climate

00:51:12.903-->00:51:17.741
change is not man made, it is
all problem and we should
further invest in coal and all

00:51:17.741-->00:51:23.447
this kinds of things they use
studies in those journals to
backup their claims so this is a

00:51:23.447-->00:51:28.986
very common strategy in
scientific political propaganda
that you say, well look on the

00:51:28.986-->00:51:34.725
one hand you’ve got all those
award winning scientist all
those great thinkers who come up

00:51:34.725-->00:51:39.930
with their theories and proofs
but we’ve got other studies that
just say the opposite and in

00:51:39.930-->00:51:45.769
this case we can really prove
that their arguments really come
from predatory publishers and

00:51:45.769-->00:51:50.741
how do we know , well we just
submitted a computer generated
nonsense paper at the exact same

00:51:50.741-->00:51:55.746
jornal and got accepted like
this, so in order to kind of
conclude this first part we

00:51:58.782-->00:52:04.288
really have to think again what
the science mean and we got back
to the slide from the beginning

00:52:04.288-->00:52:09.460
so this is not just about your
common professor doing a little
bit of research on the side

00:52:09.460-->00:52:14.932
scientific progress is really a
super important driver for our
society in the age of

00:52:14.932-->00:52:20.404
enlightenment and democracy. So
when scientists find out
influences not just political

00:52:20.404-->00:52:27.111
decision but what we buy how we
think and how we see the world.
With the knowledge you all have

00:52:27.111-->00:52:31.315
now about the predatory
publishers I think you see the
dangers that is in place there

00:52:31.315-->00:52:36.954
and anything can be decimated
anything can have the aura of
science, nobody checks it and

00:52:36.954-->00:52:41.625
when we confront many
universities, they were
absolutely clueless. They have

00:52:41.625-->00:52:47.131
never heard of this problem
before and so the societies
throw those studies, they’re

00:52:47.131-->00:52:53.337
spreading like viruses they’re
quoted here, there, lots of
dangerous thing happening. You

00:52:53.337-->00:52:58.342
can in the end no longer
distinguish fictions from facts.
The most terrible thing that

00:53:01.178-->00:53:06.450
could happen with this whole
thing is that the trust that we
have in science erodes because

00:53:06.450-->00:53:11.188
we think science is awesome, we
think science is great. And when
they do this thing they really

00:53:11.188-->00:53:16.527
sell themselves at a very very
cheap price. And the trust we
have in science and progress may

00:53:16.527-->00:53:21.532
erode. If more people publish in
those journals the trust is gone
and gthis would be terrible. So

00:53:24.101-->00:53:30.007
in order to kind of combat this
we really made a long streak of
investigative projects where we

00:53:30.007-->00:53:33.277
published all the findings that
we have and all the findings
that we have, together with 23

00:53:33.277-->00:53:38.148
media partners and journalists
around the world where we share
the data and people form all the

00:53:38.148-->00:53:44.888
countries be it Korea, or India
or United States or Austria or
France, they look into specific

00:53:44.888-->00:53:49.593
cases in their countries, which
universities are there, which
companies are there. Germany

00:53:49.593-->00:53:56.033
from the 30 of the biggest
companies, 12 has publications
in these journals. And this kind

00:53:56.033-->00:54:01.805
of publications really had the
aim to raise awareness. >> as
I’ve said, don’t mess with him.

00:54:01.805-->00:54:06.810
>>yeah ,[Laughter] its all
because of Chris. >>of DefCon
>>Those are some of the resolves

00:54:09.780-->00:54:13.083
of the publications that came
out and there's more to come,
the Guardians just ran the

00:54:13.083-->00:54:18.088
stories today and there’s more
coming up for this in the
future. So never end a talk

00:54:20.190-->00:54:26.029
without a call to action, that’s
what we learned right? We’re
speaking in front of a very very

00:54:26.029-->00:54:32.903
curious and interested audience
here , I think what you all
could do is , you can actually

00:54:32.903-->00:54:39.877
help this problem go away. When
you find a study that some wacky
person cites and this and oh you

00:54:39.877-->00:54:45.516
know what, autism doesn’t exist
or all the tobacco is not
harmful, look where they

00:54:45.516-->00:54:49.686
published, look where they study
has been published and if you
find it came from a predatory

00:54:49.686-->00:54:56.260
publishers, say so. Share the
word, spread the word about
those companies. If you look up

00:54:56.260-->00:55:01.798
your university or if you have
academic friends warn them, tell
them that this actually hurting

00:55:01.798-->00:55:06.970
science by publishing those
journals and again we know that
academic publishing has its

00:55:06.970-->00:55:12.943
flaws and even established
publishers do some mistakes but
what those predatory publishers

00:55:12.943-->00:55:17.948
are really hurting everyone. The
big point is here, you all can
help with this project, because

00:55:20.484-->00:55:25.956
you don't even need the database
or those files this is just if
you want to dive deeper, but if

00:55:25.956-->00:55:30.961
you have a simple google string
search that Svea is about to
tweet out on her account if you

00:55:33.163-->00:55:36.099
enter any word there, be it a
university email address that
you know of, be the

00:55:36.099-->00:55:38.101
controversial product you heard
of, be the controversial person
or anything that you want, if

00:55:38.101-->00:55:43.106
you google it through this,
chances are really high that you
will find if this comes from

00:55:47.878-->00:55:54.117
predatory publishers or not.
>>Look for government we found a
lot of government in Germany,

00:55:54.117-->00:55:59.957
look for surveillance because
this would be very interesting
if some surveillance stuff is

00:55:59.957-->00:56:05.262
sold with this studies >>Yeah
the military is there too
sometimes right because all

00:56:05.262-->00:56:10.367
those people they need
publications, they need the aura
of science and this is the cheap

00:56:10.367-->00:56:15.138
and easy way to do it. >>and
yeah that was a dotgov that just
submitted to the Vancouver

00:56:15.138-->00:56:21.678
conference that just has been,
you could take a look at that.
>>So I think this concludes the

00:56:21.678-->00:56:26.016
first part of our presentation
and of course this was a big
research and a big work for a

00:56:26.016-->00:56:31.421
lot of people, this whole
project is more than 3 people
here, so we thank all the people

00:56:31.421-->00:56:36.426
on this chart and everyone is
invited to stick around for the
documentary that we're about to

00:56:39.196-->00:56:43.166
show and we are approachable on
tweeter, if you find something
get in touch with us, we will

00:56:43.166-->00:56:48.405
hang around after the show here
of course. Come talk to us we’ll
share our knowledge, we thank

00:56:48.405-->00:56:53.577
very very much for your
attention and this has been
great, this has been a pleasure,

00:56:53.577-->00:56:58.582
DefCon, you guys are awesome.
[applause from the audience]
We’ll get the documentary setup

00:57:05.922-->00:57:10.928
I mean if those guys just give
my money back when I ask you
know, that would really tied the

00:57:15.799-->00:57:22.472
room together. >>and so the
documentary we showing now is of
course is subtitled so you will

00:57:22.472-->00:57:27.477
understand it. If you have
questions now, while we're
setting up the laptop, we’re

00:57:27.477-->00:57:32.482
happy to answer. >>If you have
quick question we have some
time, come in front or speak it

00:57:34.584-->00:57:40.691
loud so that we can hear you.
>>I think we have a question
here. >>So of all the papers you

00:57:40.691-->00:57:47.564
did research of those how many
are those are really legitimate.
>>We’ll the question was, from

00:57:47.564-->00:57:51.435
the papers that we looked up,
how many are those are really
legitimate, that is a very great

00:57:51.435-->00:57:56.440
question and the answer is hard
to tell, because only some of
them that we found out where

00:57:58.709-->00:58:02.479
seemingly really dangerous for
example with the cancer
medications, we gave them to

00:58:02.479-->00:58:07.484
other legitimate scientists to
look them up, so we didn’t of
course control all of the papers

00:58:07.484-->00:58:13.423
and see how good they are but we
really think the problem is that
it is impossible to tell the

00:58:13.423-->00:58:18.562
difference. We kinda have a
comparison like in Germany you
have a big institution that

00:58:18.562-->00:58:25.268
every car has to go there, i
think it's like the DMV here,
you get a sticker on your car

00:58:25.268-->00:58:31.174
that checks if everything is ok.
Those predatory publisher are
like the DMV just putting the

00:58:31.174-->00:58:36.880
stickers on any car without
looking at them, most of the
cars are gonna be ok, some of

00:58:36.880-->00:58:42.085
them will have fumes that are
poisonous and some won’t have
brakes because nobody looked at

00:58:42.085-->00:58:47.124
them and this is the problem
with those journals that nobody
looks at them so the filtering

00:58:47.124-->00:58:52.262
function is gone, now everything
is science, everything is peer
reviewed and you can't tell the

00:58:52.262-->00:58:58.435
difference so we invite everyone
here to find paper and go for a
hunt and look it up and if you

00:58:58.435-->00:59:04.007
have expert friends and you have
a paper, show it to them and
share the knowledge >>and if

00:59:04.007-->00:59:09.379
office publishing papers to
these places and kinda leaving
them there granted sometimes

00:59:09.379-->00:59:15.786
it's hard for your paper removed
so that’s a fact but if people
are publishing there which is

00:59:15.786-->00:59:21.825
deceptive in its own right then
you have to then wonder is the
whole pool polluted, how was the

00:59:21.825-->00:59:27.697
research methodology and how the
data, we just don’t know and
when there’s an open access or

00:59:27.697-->00:59:32.702
prepub paper you know the
science archive or oscfdotio you
have to question why research

00:59:36.973-->00:59:41.978
has been publishing there
instead. So it's really
difficult to extract what’s real

00:59:44.214-->00:59:49.519
and what’s not and what are the
people’s motivation for
publishing there. >>We’ve got

00:59:49.519-->00:59:54.524
another question there. [off-mic
question] Well so the question
was, how those business models

01:00:07.504-->01:00:12.375
of the conferences and the
publications are intertwined and
the answer is yes, they are

01:00:12.375-->01:00:17.547
absolutely intertwined. For
example OMICS, one of the key
players in this they offer both,

01:00:17.547-->01:00:21.585
they do a lot of conferences and
a lot of journals and there’s
currently actually an ongoing

01:00:21.585-->01:00:26.423
FTC investigation here in the
United States against OMICS
because of their deceptive

01:00:26.423-->01:00:31.428
practices. So a lot of people
who publishes there also go to
the conferences, of course there

01:00:34.865-->01:00:39.870
are some separations as well
there are people who just go to
conferences, there are those who

01:00:43.140-->01:00:49.713
just publish but many do both,
full package right, another
question. [off-mic question]

01:00:49.713-->01:00:55.752
>>We actually research one case
in Germany where we have a
professor. In Germany its like

01:00:55.752-->01:01:00.690
you have to collect papers and
if you have enough paper and
then you are a professor and in

01:01:02.826-->01:01:07.831
this case we found his work and
lot of his work was from
predatory publishers, and he was

01:01:10.967-->01:01:15.939
a professor, he was actually a
Toubou professor because he was
very young I think he actually

01:01:15.939-->01:01:20.944
have 2 or 3 phd degrees and he
was a very young professor and
we called him and he sweated a

01:01:25.415-->01:01:30.420
lot , we did a lot of phone
calls we didn’t publish his name
, if the people don’t look

01:01:33.356-->01:01:40.230
closely they may not see that
this is published in predatory
journals. >>Also, sorry question

01:01:40.230-->01:01:45.235
over there [off-mic question]
>>We were really often asked for
doing this, >>The question was

01:02:12.963-->01:02:19.903
are we gonna make the database
available >>We can’t do this
because its gonna be a legal

01:02:19.903-->01:02:26.309
problem because in Germany it
is, when you publish a person's
name then you first give an

01:02:26.309-->01:02:31.314
opportunity to say something for
this allegations and with
400-->000 signed this will not be

01:02:35.051-->01:02:40.056
possible for us, so the only
thing we can do and this is what
we did here is to publish this

01:02:43.193-->01:02:48.198
easy google search so everybody
can track these institutions and
we try to help people to do the

01:02:51.601-->01:02:56.973
scraping or probably to do the
scraping project put it on
github so that everybody can do

01:02:56.973-->01:03:01.911
it because we cannot publish the
whole database in the web.
[off-mic question] >>Great

01:03:20.964-->01:03:25.969
question, yes, [off-mic
question] >>That was a good
question, so the question was if

01:03:31.241-->01:03:35.679
we came across with the fact
that some of those journals they
actually list people there as

01:03:35.679-->01:03:41.151
editors or editorial board
members and yes we came across
tons of people who would either

01:03:41.151-->01:03:46.156
be already dead that happens, so
not a lot of work on their side
or people who are absolutely

01:03:48.525-->01:03:53.830
clueless about this, because you
know those website photos
they’re public their CVs are

01:03:53.830-->01:03:57.934
public so those predatory
publishers, take their photos
from the website and put them up

01:03:57.934-->01:04:02.338
there and when we ask them, we
wrote email to those people we
looked them up and said did you

01:04:02.338-->01:04:07.043
know that you’re a publisher
there or an editor there and a
lot of people replied I have

01:04:07.043-->01:04:12.549
never heard of this and they
tried legal steps to get their
pictures removed but we don’t

01:04:12.549-->01:04:17.554
know how will it end. >>but with
the scraping code only took the
papers and the abstract, the

01:04:20.156-->01:04:26.062
scraping did not include the
editors but what the scraping
code of course included was

01:04:26.062-->01:04:31.067
paper who probably where people
want to retracted but didn’t get
through it, so yes of course the

01:04:34.370-->01:04:40.243
400-->000 scientist there that
might be a crowd of people who
is in there but who definitely

01:04:40.243-->01:04:44.414
don’t want to be in there, >>and
there’s a question over there
>>so maybe one or two more

01:04:44.414-->01:04:48.051
questions and then we will have
more questions more after the
documentary. >>One more

01:04:48.051-->01:04:53.056
question, a guy has been
standing patiently with his arm
[off-mic question] >>you mean

01:05:03.233-->01:05:05.235
like the gcmaf case?yeah we’re
investigating still into the
data, yeah, so there’s more

01:05:05.235-->01:05:07.237
stuff coming out there but we
really hope input from other
people because some of those

01:05:07.237-->01:05:09.239
findings you just have to come
across them, we don’t know any
wonder drug that was sold in

01:05:09.239-->01:05:11.241
Minnesota or South Korea or
wherever around the world those
snake oil sellers sell those

01:05:11.241-->01:05:13.243
business, yeah of course we
still keep looking into these
data sets and see what we can

01:05:13.243-->01:05:15.245
find. Since it's easy to find
those products we hope that all
the people pick it up and do the

01:05:15.245-->01:05:21.785
work as well >>the google search
will get you far actually and
the scaping is super easy too.

01:05:21.785-->01:05:26.790
Should we roll the video?
>>Yeah, so let’s watch the film
its like around 30 minutes and

01:05:29.058-->01:05:34.063
we’ll stick aroun and take more
questions afterwards. Thanks so
far this is has been great. >>I

01:05:36.166-->01:05:41.171
got it figured out how to stop
this >>Thank you >>And it starts
in again and again and again and

01:08:37.213-->01:08:42.218
trapped in some loophole, time
continuum [Laughter] >>Thank you
so much >>Thanks for sticking

01:21:38.861-->01:21:43.866
around >>For sticking around and
watching even it was in all
German and only subtitle, we

01:22:28.410-->01:22:33.415
shared the link on twitter so if
you want to share the video it
is on my sections website also

01:23:30.305-->01:23:35.310
subtitled. Spread the word. I
think if nobody go there if
nobody publish there, this is a

01:24:22.925-->01:24:27.930
pretty easy way to end their
business model. Thank you,
>>We’ll happy to take few

01:25:09.371-->01:25:14.376
questions before we clear before
get thrown out. There are couple
of points and figure out where

01:26:01.990-->01:26:06.995
the money went for the
conferences what happened to
that fund there’s some

01:26:42.264-->01:26:47.269
interesting angles to explore
and we’ll be digging a little
bit deeper. >>And if anybody ask

01:27:10.258-->01:27:13.895
themselves what actually
happened to our terrible cancer
paper with the bees. Because we

01:27:13.895-->01:27:18.366
thought we don’t want this to be
out in the public anymore, we
just try to prove a point here,

01:27:18.366-->01:27:23.371
so what we did, we wrote an
email to OMICS saying, oh you
know what? We made some terrible

01:32:03.885-->01:32:08.890
mistakes, and by terrible
mistake we mean everything. The
mythology was crappy. We sent

01:34:59.594-->01:35:04.532
them a list of stuff that was
completely wrong and ask them to
take the paper offline, so guess

01:35:15.510-->01:35:20.515
what happened, they’re trying to
charge us, they said oh sure you
can take it offline but we need

01:35:30.925-->01:35:35.930
a retraction fee, whatever that
is for 2-->000 Euros so we didn’t
pay but the moment we kind of

01:35:58.419-->01:36:04.525
said that we were journalists
investigating the predatory
publishing model, the same day

01:36:04.525-->01:36:09.530
the thing was gone. So it's no
longer there luckily, but we had
to put them under pressure with

01:36:13.501-->01:36:18.506
journalistic research because if
we were not to snul people we
would have to pay 2000 Euros to

01:36:21.476-->01:36:26.481
get the stuff removed. So they
earn money both ends. >>Looks
like there’s a question over

01:36:51.806-->01:36:55.076
there, might not be able to hear
you, you might want to come a
little bit forward but you can

01:36:55.076-->01:37:00.014
shout, give it a go. [off-mic
question] >>No, I wish we did,
but there’s a lady that tweeted

01:37:06.287-->01:37:11.626
the WASETWATCH website yesterday
and said you should have seen
the scene in found out in

01:37:11.626-->01:37:16.564
Vancouver when people found out
that this was a Bullsh*t
factory. It might be interesting

01:37:16.564-->01:37:21.569
to follow up with here and see
what’s going on but there was
also a USdotgov paper I think

01:37:23.571-->01:37:28.543
that was submitted to that
conference not the cyber
security conference but one of

01:37:28.543-->01:37:33.548
the conferences out of the 150
odd conferences held in a small
room. There’s a more questions

01:37:39.620-->01:37:44.625
over there? Yeah you, sorry,
that’s vague but yeah. [off-mic
question] So the question is, if

01:37:56.704-->01:38:02.176
there papers that has been
published there maybe some PHDs
might be provided what do we

01:38:02.176-->01:38:07.849
think about that? not provide,
not provide, what’s the word for
that [inaudible] 1:38:06, It has

01:38:07.849-->01:38:13.921
been a long day. >>We actually
can’t tell, maybe, all we could
do is spread the word and make

01:38:13.921-->01:38:20.328
this whole thing public and we
confronted many many
universities with our findings

01:38:20.328-->01:38:27.034
and now it's up to them what
they do. Probably they have to
look at the specific papers

01:38:27.034-->01:38:33.608
whether or not they are worth
the scientific label or not, so
I think it's up to the

01:38:33.608-->01:38:38.613
universities. [off-mic question]
>>Who’s supposed to be doing the
job that us guy has been doing,

01:38:57.799-->01:39:03.471
I guess holding these folks in
account right? >>Well to our
knowledge there’s no national or

01:39:03.471-->01:39:08.476
international entity that
controls the publication
processes of scientist so I

01:39:11.512-->01:39:16.517
think there needs to be like
this, its hard to make >>There‘s
a freedom of publication for

01:39:18.820-->01:39:24.525
scientists and I think this is a
very important good that you can
publish your study wherever you

01:39:24.525-->01:39:29.530
want for us the problem is only
if you publish your study and
you write peer reviewed and

01:39:31.599-->01:39:38.573
scientific on it. You know,
what’s on it should be in it,
and this is with this predatory

01:39:38.573-->01:39:43.578
publisher which is not, so the
universities I thinks there is
kind of blacklisting or white

01:39:46.047-->01:39:52.987
listing going on right not. And
we definitely want to contribute
to this and they think this

01:39:52.987-->01:39:59.961
could be a way, blacklisting,
whitelisting then because of our
research many universities and

01:39:59.961-->01:40:04.966
institutions in Germany they do
FAQs and DOs and DONT’s. So the
communities right now tries to

01:40:08.102-->01:40:13.107
help itself and I think this is
a good solution but we will look
in one year or one and a half

01:40:16.077-->01:40:21.082
year if the scientific community
is able to cure this. I’m not
pessimistic probably > We need

01:40:27.455-->01:40:33.461
to understand one of the reason
why this business model is
successful is because is also a

01:40:33.461-->01:40:38.099
business with shame, you go
there as a young researcher
maybe or maybe a established

01:40:38.099-->01:40:43.938
researcher you get your paper
there you pay the publication
fee you go to these conferences

01:40:43.938-->01:40:49.510
and you find out oh damn this is
sort of a scam, I fell for a
weird deceptive business

01:40:49.510-->01:40:56.250
practice but nobody knows, so
you go home, they ask you, so
how was the conference? Do you

01:40:56.250-->01:41:02.290
really say I was scammed, this
was a big mistake I actually
threw away government money or

01:41:02.290-->01:41:04.292
funding money. Many people
doesn’t really have the guts to
do this and they just say it was

01:41:04.292-->01:41:06.294
okayish and try to answer in
short sentences and then hope
people talk about something else

01:41:06.294-->01:41:08.296
and so this is definitely a goal
from our research that public
know about this that there's

01:41:08.296-->01:41:10.298
awareness about this and I think
after the publication it's hard
to say no >>and also to

01:41:10.298-->01:41:12.300
encourage people to go forward
we even if you google best
presentation at WASET, so many

01:41:12.300-->01:41:14.302
universities give up press
releases having this like people
are holding this I have a

01:41:14.302-->01:41:16.304
presentation award from WASET
because they probably were too
ashamed to tell at home. Yeah

01:41:16.304-->01:41:18.306
please [off-mic question]
Question was, if there was
criterias so that I can see if

01:41:18.306-->01:41:20.308
it is a predatory journal or not
one answer is impact factors,
you can look at impact factors

01:41:20.308-->01:41:22.310
they are very low or non
existent it might be a hint.
There are also new publications

01:41:22.310-->01:41:27.315
out there for example that they
are courageous people founding a
journal and making it peer

01:41:32.453-->01:41:37.458
reviewed but they don't have
impact factor this is not the
only criterium, I must admit its

01:43:02.510-->01:43:07.515
very hard to definitely say this
is a fake journal or something
we did for our research was we

01:43:12.686-->01:43:17.691
had more criteria so submitting
a fake paper was only one but
look at the website is there an

01:43:22.229-->01:43:27.234
office beauro is there and
address and official address.
>>and is legit or is it for

01:43:35.509-->01:43:40.414
example some of them has
addresses in London but if you
google the address, its just

01:43:40.414-->01:43:42.416
somebody who sells adverses
virtual office addresses like
that. There are some lists out

01:43:42.416-->01:43:44.418
there there’s a guy that we
called Jeffrey Biel he did a lot
of research in this and he

01:43:44.418-->01:43:49.757
published it as Biels’s list
where he did his own research
and published and make it public

01:43:49.757-->01:43:56.197
which papers and journals and
conference organizers he deems
predatory. Again there’s some

01:43:56.197-->01:44:00.367
problem with just a single
person doing this and having a
definitive list, but this is

01:44:00.367-->01:44:05.539
definitely a good hint, he did
some amazing job there, there’s
another company called Cabo’s

01:44:05.539-->01:44:09.944
they offer some black and
whitelist too, they’re
subscription based for them its

01:44:09.944-->01:44:15.616
a business model too >>For
medical papers, there’s
peppermint and there’s also

01:44:15.616-->01:44:21.722
whitelisting in India. What we
did in the research was looking
it different whitelist blacklist

01:44:21.722-->01:44:26.727
from the country. It’s a hard
job to find that out. It’s a
hard job for scientists for

01:44:30.431-->01:44:36.437
journalist but it think with
these companies with research I
think you can be pretty sure for

01:44:36.437-->01:44:41.408
this company. >>If its OMICS or
WASET or science domain popup
you’re pretty >>For OMICS you

01:44:41.408-->01:44:46.413
have the FDC investigating this
for WASET the CUNY case is also
being investigated in New York.

01:44:50.351-->01:44:55.356
This is also an hint for a
predatory publisher. [off-mic
comment] [Laughter] >>There’s a

01:45:08.135-->01:45:13.140
question over there [off-mic
question] >>In London for
example in a conference there

01:45:15.176-->01:45:20.181
was a guy and he was really
funny, He was from India, and he
was pretty frank and honest and

01:45:40.868-->01:45:47.541
he was a professor I think he
did not anything to lose and he
said I know this is a fake

01:45:47.541-->01:45:52.546
conference anybody from India
has to see London one time. Of
course yeah, there are people

01:45:58.986-->01:46:05.492
using the system of course there
are >>and you have 29 in
publications there you should

01:46:05.492-->01:46:10.931
probably be a little bit
suspicious about the practice.
The thing is when we submitted

01:46:10.931-->01:46:15.936
our fake cancer paper there we
got some comments they were
superficial, this paper was full

01:46:18.706-->01:46:23.878
of mistakes we just presented
few of them here. We wrote the
for the purpose of being

01:46:23.878-->01:46:30.251
discovered in a way, we did not,
so the comments we got back were
so superficial that we thought

01:46:30.251-->01:46:37.157
this was absolutely no proper
peer review but if you are like
a scientists who considers the

01:46:37.157-->01:46:43.030
research great and you think you
did an amazing job, and the only
review you get after 2 days

01:46:43.030-->01:46:48.269
which should raise some eyebrows
I agree but those only comments
are, this is an amazing paper

01:46:48.269-->01:46:53.607
you should just maybe change one
word, one top head line
somewhere you think oh, I did a

01:46:53.607-->01:47:00.414
good job so many people don’t
have many self criticism to see
that this is not a proper peer

01:47:00.414-->01:47:05.419
review. [off-mic question]
>>Yes, very good question, after
how big is WASET and how many

01:47:20.668-->01:47:27.574
people are working there so we
went to 3 WASET conferences and
we had this international

01:47:27.574-->01:47:33.847
partners so I don’t know how
many WASET conferences we went
total but probably 6 or 8 with

01:47:33.847-->01:47:40.521
of course you know South Korea
and different other places we
think yes it's a family business

01:47:40.521-->01:47:45.526
and Bora is doing Europe, we
spotted him in Europe,
Copenhagen, Berlin, London and

01:47:47.828-->01:47:51.398
we’re thinking his father
Chamal, doing Asia and also
Turkey, and they also have some

01:47:51.398-->01:47:56.904
kind of friends in the US so
this is not a family member we
met in New York, And we’re

01:47:56.904-->01:47:58.906
thinking the daughter maybe is
doing the books or something so
she’s doing the work behind, so

01:47:58.906-->01:48:01.275
it's a very very small company
and they think they can be a
small company because there’s no

01:48:01.275-->01:48:04.011
much work to do. >>So all that
Bora was doing at the conference
we went to was literally sitting

01:48:04.011-->01:48:06.013
just outside the conference room
was collecting money and giving
out name tags >>He left his

01:48:06.013-->01:48:08.015
laptop unlocked all the time and
you just upload your
presentation on a usb stick so

01:48:08.015-->01:48:10.017
maybe I shouldn’t have said
that. [Laughter] These guys,
they have a pretty funny story

01:48:10.017-->01:48:12.019
when they worked with these 23
different media partners and I
think there was one conference

01:48:12.019-->01:48:17.024
where there was a bunch of
people presenting their Bullsh*t
papers at the same conference

01:48:46.487-->01:48:48.489
but none of them knew that, so
its a full conference of
Bullsh*t papers. By these,

01:48:48.489-->01:48:50.491
they’re like are you a
journalist? Are you a
journalist? [off-mic question]

01:48:50.491-->01:48:55.496
We talked to who sorry? [off-mic
question] Did we talk to tax
authorities, I don’t know what

01:49:10.110-->01:49:15.115
the US tax authorities are but I
did know to file the FTC, the
FBI and figure out at some point

01:49:20.487-->01:49:26.393
maybe they’ll get around
something like that? And I did
that and a few countries as well

01:49:26.393-->01:49:32.232
not just the US, like Canada
where they were having
conferences last year, they were

01:49:32.232-->01:49:37.237
in Taiwan, so folks are aware
about it. There’s a question
there. [off-mic question] Oh

01:49:41.942-->01:49:46.947
sorry I didn't hear [off-mic
question] Was the question,
correct me if I’m wrong, but who

01:49:57.758-->01:50:02.763
we looked into, how to deal with
the avalanche of spam that
academic are getting from these

01:50:15.442-->01:50:21.648
various publishers and how many
people are responding, and a
lots of people responding, I

01:50:21.648-->01:50:28.088
have not looked. Have you guys?
>>No, its hard to tell, we kind
of think that most people and

01:50:28.088-->01:50:34.828
the publishing there have to
some degrees responded to those
spam emails that most academics

01:50:34.828-->01:50:41.401
know and we received in bulk
after we made those fake
institutions and those kind of

01:50:41.401-->01:50:46.206
things so we will also wondering
who would reply to that but
actually those spam emails

01:50:46.206-->01:50:51.845
really vary on sophistication
some of them are just hi, you
researcher, you want to publish

01:50:51.845-->01:50:58.719
this great, so ok, some of them
are really like giving the
correct titles citing some works

01:50:58.719-->01:51:03.724
that we have done oh we read
that you did some work on
cancer, do you want to do this

01:51:03.724-->01:51:10.497
and this and this some of them
don’t really look like you’re
just really normal spam and

01:51:10.497-->01:51:16.436
again if you don’t suspect
people to be that evil and if
you don't expect predatory

01:51:16.436-->01:51:21.475
publisher exist you can think
this is a legitimate publisher
request for publications, oh

01:51:21.475-->01:51:25.612
they discovered my greatness,
finally somebody found out what
great research I’m doing and

01:51:25.612-->01:51:30.284
invite me to publish oh yeah
great I want to do this.so some
people definitely fall for this

01:51:30.284-->01:51:35.556
reason. >>I mean I didn’t get an
email invite, I googled it, you
know it's like political

01:51:35.556-->01:51:40.227
psychology I wasn’t aware of
this I’ll look for a conference,
that looks kind of legit, looks

01:51:40.227-->01:51:45.032
like an I triple E conference so
I wasn’t that any wiser and
maybe finding that conference

01:51:45.032-->01:51:50.037
that way too, We did eventually
get all of these stuff removed
once we talked about it with

01:51:52.639-->01:51:57.644
journalists thing went pretty
quickly and a couple of weeks
ago we uploaded the full paper

01:52:00.681-->01:52:05.686
to a pre-pop server OSFDOTIO and
we will be submitting papers for
those for the whole peer review

01:52:29.710-->01:52:34.715
process. [off-mic question]
>>Yes, in the US this is the
first, you are the first woman

01:52:39.886-->01:52:44.891
who hear about this. [off-mic
question] >>Who is the lady you
mentioned? Rachael Maddo NSMBC I

01:52:53.433-->01:52:58.438
don’t know, have we? >>We teamed
up with a New Yorker because the
writer there he already did a

01:53:04.978-->01:53:09.983
story about this fake predatory
publisher. Yeah we will come up
with >>Yeah sure >>Yeah we will

01:53:21.161-->01:53:26.667
write it down, because Germany,
far away from US so and.
[laughter] >>We work together

01:53:26.667-->01:53:32.105
like Mother Jones picked up the
research that we did and there’s
an institution an amazing one

01:53:32.105-->01:53:37.444
that also supports the
international ICIJ international
Consortium of Investigative

01:53:37.444-->01:53:42.282
Journalists they use to supply
us with some help some
connecting with other journalist

01:53:42.282-->01:53:46.653
they gave us technical
infrastructure where we could
share findings in an encrypted

01:53:46.653-->01:53:52.325
basis that not anyone can read
the work that we we’re doing so
this is an American institution

01:53:52.325-->01:53:56.897
too so they work together with
an American >>This specially
with the US there’s a lot of

01:53:56.897-->01:54:02.669
research that can be done
specially if you want to follow
cases like the malincrot case or

01:54:02.669-->01:54:08.208
if you want to follow all these
U2 coalition case because we did
not research these cases until

01:54:08.208-->01:54:14.514
the end or the governmental
places. >>We wanted to leave
something special for DefCon so

01:54:14.514-->01:54:20.454
we didn’t want too much
information in the US before
DefCon and so we we’re

01:54:20.454-->01:54:25.459
constantly worried that this
might just kickoff please don’t
and and yeah now we're happy for

01:54:27.828-->01:54:32.833
it to be bread [off-mic
question] >>Also I spoke with
our legal person from the

01:54:43.110-->01:54:48.115
station before DefCon because
definitely a github project its
project its private, but he did

01:54:50.784-->01:54:55.789
not want to cover for this so I
would love to make this private
project public here this would

01:54:58.992-->01:55:05.198
have been great but you know as
these companies, specially
OMICS, they are really willing

01:55:05.198-->01:55:12.172
to fight so I could not release
it but I mean if there’s a
researcher who’s really

01:55:12.172-->01:55:18.612
interested in doing this then
just give me a shoutout maybe we
can do something >>Yeah it's

01:55:18.612-->01:55:23.617
pretty straightforward so if
some to be happen to do that and
put it out there. [off-mic

01:55:37.531-->01:55:40.901
question] That’s awesome, >>That
would be a good idea , that’s
the follow up, thanks for that!

01:55:40.901-->01:55:45.906
We should come up with a name,
that’s the next challenge, The
International Journal of

01:55:48.341-->01:55:53.346
Bullsh*t That would be my
suggestion IJB [Laughter] Yeah,
correct. >>Okay, Alright, Thanks

01:55:59.886-->01:56:04.825
>>Thank you so much for this,
this has been a pleasure.
[Applause]
