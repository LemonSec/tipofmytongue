00:00:01.368-->00:00:06.440
>> Hey guys, uh, my name is
Eduardo, I'm from Brazil, uh.
Alongside my friend, Rodrigo, we

00:00:06.440-->00:00:11.445
did, uh, this research on, uh,
state, uh, brothers. And, uh,
sadly he couldn't be here today.

00:00:15.182-->00:00:19.686
Uh, we actually are independent
researchers so we couldn't
afford to be, uh, both of us

00:00:19.686-->00:00:24.691
here. So, I'm gonna do my best
to replace him. Okay, the idea
here is to talk, uh, a nation

00:00:27.561-->00:00:32.566
state, uh, activity online. And
not focussing so much on huge
big brothers but the little ones

00:00:34.668-->00:00:39.673
also. Uh, we have, uh, for, uh,
four snaps for our agenda -
some, intro and some basic

00:00:43.877-->00:00:48.882
concepts. The major sources we
used to do our research and the
outcomes of the analysis and the

00:00:51.618-->00:00:56.623
conclusion and final remarks
regarding the subject. Okay, the
idea we borrow here from the

00:00:59.893-->00:01:06.333
16th, cele, uh, philosopher,
English philosopher - Thomas
Hobbes, the idea that basically

00:01:06.333-->00:01:11.338
human beings can not work. Uh,
he wasn't very, very optimistic,
he considered, that we would,

00:01:14.041-->00:01:19.046
uh, almost all all the time
resort to some sort of state of
nature and civil war, which is,

00:01:21.949-->00:01:26.353
you know, 16th century
philosophy. Uh, if you think
about the internet, it's a

00:01:26.353-->00:01:31.358
pretty good example of, uh,
exactly the opposite. People
gather around a common idea

00:01:33.493-->00:01:40.334
without a top-down authority,
without someone saying how it
should be. So, consensus may

00:01:40.334-->00:01:45.339
take awhile, but, uh, eventually
emerges. So, this idea largely
been used politicians try to

00:01:47.808-->00:01:52.813
increase state power. The idea
that threats are too big - we
have terrorism, we have

00:01:55.849-->00:02:00.787
terrorism, we have cyber crime,
we have espionage. So, we need
to give power to someone - to an

00:02:05.292-->00:02:12.099
authority, uh, often they're
politicians. So they want the
increase state power, and,

00:02:12.099-->00:02:17.170
through our research we found
out that quite the opposite. The
most effective and most, uh,

00:02:17.170-->00:02:22.175
active around cyber space is
actually states doing things -
attacking. Not only other states

00:02:27.147-->00:02:33.453
but major, uh, attacks against
civil society and political
groups. So, it's one of the the

00:02:33.453-->00:02:38.458
conclusions of our research and
I hope we can show you some
evidence of that. Uh, some three

00:02:41.194-->00:02:46.199
concepts - these are not
academical ones that we use to
look for and state misbehaviour,

00:02:48.268-->00:02:54.708
state "big-brotherish" activity.
Uh, espionage, surveillance, uh,
eavesdropping and censorship.

00:02:54.708-->00:03:01.181
Uh, you might find better
concepts than the ones we are
listing here but the ideas to

00:03:01.181-->00:03:06.186
which we went looking for
evidence, uh, concerning nation
state activity online. Well, the

00:03:09.890-->00:03:14.895
main sources, uh, that we went
for are five, uh, first APT
reports, uh, those are the

00:03:19.499-->00:03:26.139
reports and blog posts from
private vendors, NGOs, uh,
C-certs, universities. We have

00:03:26.139-->00:03:32.079
some studies from EFF, from
Citizen Lab from Toronto; some
certs from Japan, the United

00:03:32.079-->00:03:37.084
States. So, it's uh, it's uh,
pretty, pretty wide material.
Over 750 of them, uh, it's

00:03:40.020-->00:03:46.059
pretty Western-biased, so 80
percent of them are actually
from countries, uh, within the

00:03:46.059-->00:03:51.064
Western hemisphere. But, uh, it
allows us to take a good grasp
on, uh, state activity -

00:03:54.301-->00:04:00.140
specially focussing on political
targets - NGOs, political
opposition, so forth. The second

00:04:00.140-->00:04:05.145
and third, uh, major sources are
not exactly the actions of the
states, the nation states

00:04:07.247-->00:04:13.453
sponsored attacks. But the
potential capability, so, he
fact that the states are buying,

00:04:13.453-->00:04:19.593
they're acquiring, uh, offensive
solutions. And we got that from
major leagues from hacking team

00:04:19.593-->00:04:25.999
and Gamma Group and kingfisher.
And also some good open sources
out there such as, such as

00:04:25.999-->00:04:32.806
bugged planet and the
surveillance industry index, uh,
even official documents such as,

00:04:32.806-->00:04:39.146
uh, reports from, uh,
exploitations from United,
United Kingdom, uh, Germany and

00:04:39.146-->00:04:45.986
Switzerland. Uh, also issue
some, uh, uh, license to sell
spyware. So, that was a, a

00:04:45.986-->00:04:50.991
pretty good source for that too.
THe fourth and fifth sources, we
have looking for censorship,

00:04:54.127-->00:05:00.600
several different organisations
do look u that on the, uh,
online. We're gonna cover them

00:05:00.600-->00:05:06.907
up, uh, uh, in the next slides.
And the fifth one is
transparency reports which is

00:05:06.907-->00:05:12.979
pretty interesting because it's,
uh, relatively new, uh, it
started with the Snowden

00:05:12.979-->00:05:18.218
revelations where companies
interested in increasing their
accountability started to

00:05:18.218-->00:05:23.223
publish the government requests
of content and removal. So, we
have a pretty interesting view

00:05:26.493-->00:05:31.498
on how governments are behaving
towards, uh, that online
information. Okay, jumping into

00:05:36.503-->00:05:41.508
some of the outcomes, we're
gonna focus first on what we
have seen from state, uh, cyber

00:05:43.543-->00:05:49.182
attacks, state-sponsored cyber
attacks. In 55 percent of the
documents lead to some level of

00:05:49.182-->00:05:54.187
attribution. We had a pickle
when we needed to, uh, group the
documents among the, uh, actors,

00:05:58.625-->00:06:04.731
uh, along campaigns. Because
vendors tend to have a branding
of their own. Someone call them

00:06:04.731-->00:06:11.471
bears, someone call APT
"yada-yada" and then we had to
group it so we wouldn't count

00:06:11.471-->00:06:16.476
twice for the same attack for
instance. But that lead us to
119, uh, state-sponsored

00:06:18.578-->00:06:25.085
attacks, which is a lot. And,
uh, when, when we looked for the
countries, when the attribution

00:06:25.085-->00:06:32.025
allowed that, we found out, uh,
19 different countries with, uh,
a state-sponsored APT - Advanced

00:06:32.025-->00:06:37.030
Persistent Threat. And, you get
a picture like that. Uh, the map
shows us of course the

00:06:39.099-->00:06:44.104
traditional ones - RUssia, US,
Israel etcetera. But we also get
to see some different countries

00:06:47.307-->00:06:52.312
- such as Ethiopian, Lebanon,
Sierra, Pakistan. Countries that
you might not think that have

00:06:55.815-->00:07:00.754
this capabilities. So, it's
interesting to see, uh, how
diffuse it is. And when we look

00:07:06.559-->00:07:11.564
at the types of targets it's
interesting to notice also that
in 46 cases we had political

00:07:13.600-->00:07:18.605
targets. Ad I mean, by political
targets I mean opposition
parties, I mean NGOs, uh,

00:07:20.807-->00:07:26.479
independent media outlets. So,
it's rather interesting to see
that it's, it's the first place

00:07:26.479-->00:07:32.218
even ahead of, uk, military,
governmental or diplomatic
targets. So, it's pretty

00:07:32.218-->00:07:37.223
interesting to see that, uh, we
have evidence that attacks are
being, uh, uh, directed to civil

00:07:39.759-->00:07:44.831
society, to groups, to political
interests. And not exactly
interstate, uh, affairs.

00:07:44.831-->00:07:51.204
[background noise] Jumping to
the idea of potential
capabilities - the second layer

00:07:51.204-->00:07:56.209
- we should say, we found 71
countries that acquired some
solutions. Uh, 41 of them we

00:07:59.512-->00:08:04.451
couldn't even, we couldn't
identify the user or buyer. In
19 cases the buyer was military

00:08:07.153-->00:08:13.426
or an intelligence agency, which
is interesting because they tend
to operate, uh, with less

00:08:13.426-->00:08:20.333
oversight from traditional
branch for instance. And in 20
cases we see an application of,

00:08:20.333-->00:08:26.373
uh, backup policies. Where,
where not you buy from multiple
providers, maybe one of them

00:08:26.373-->00:08:32.746
weren't on board so you have
another one. Uh, that's the
picture we see from the

00:08:32.746-->00:08:39.352
distribution of 71 countries.
Uh, and the major providers, we,
uh, identified. Uh, interesting

00:08:39.352-->00:08:46.292
to notice that not all of these
are providers of, uh, offensive
solutions, we have a, uh,

00:08:46.292-->00:08:51.197
interesting report from Citizen
lab that covers the use of
applications from Procera, in

00:08:51.197-->00:08:56.136
Turkey and Syria, uh, for the
use of surveillance, uh, in
those countries. Which is really

00:08:56.136-->00:09:03.042
interesting. And narrowing down
the countries that we identify
to be military or intelligence

00:09:03.042-->00:09:08.047
agency users, and the others
that we didn't know, we
couldn't, uh, uh, see who, who

00:09:10.984-->00:09:15.989
actually bought it. We have
this, this map and when we
select the user buyers from

00:09:18.158-->00:09:24.164
military intel and, and
intelligent community we get
these 19 countries. You et to

00:09:24.164-->00:09:29.469
see, uh, that a lot, uh, a lot
of middle Eastern countries,
North of Africa and South, South

00:09:29.469-->00:09:34.474
East Asian countries are there.
Which is kind of a trend across
our data. Uh, here is the

00:09:37.977-->00:09:44.284
picture considering the multiple
providers form red to green we
seeing red - the countries that

00:09:44.284-->00:09:50.457
acquired four solutions and the
orange - the three, yellow -
two, and the green - just a

00:09:50.457-->00:09:56.996
single solution. Uh, we had
also, it's easier to see here in
the graph, you can see that

00:09:56.996-->00:10:02.001
South East Asia and middle East.
[clears throat] Sorry about
that. Uh, are the countries, are

00:10:04.804-->00:10:09.809
the regions which have countries
with most, uh, actually, uh,
multiple providers. SO, it's uh,

00:10:12.545-->00:10:18.818
it's a kind of a trend, it's not
a surprise. So, uh, uh, we see
this repeated over and over in

00:10:18.818-->00:10:23.823
our data. And on the right, of
course, you see the user buyers
from, uh, category perspective.

00:10:27.827-->00:10:32.832
When we jumped into the idea of
censorship, uh, censorship, and
the blocking of contents we also

00:10:35.134-->00:10:40.840
found, uh, 40 countries with
some evidence of online
censorship. And 42 countries

00:10:40.840-->00:10:47.080
with some level of internet
shutdown. Uh, curious to see
that in almost 75 percent of the

00:10:47.080-->00:10:51.684
cases the shutdown reached the
national level - which is
remarkable if you think about

00:10:51.684-->00:10:56.689
it. And, in 57 countries they
were in different, uh,
methodologies and different, uh,

00:10:59.626-->00:11:04.864
sources. So, we enforce the idea
that those countries are
actually are engaging in this

00:11:04.864-->00:11:09.869
kind of bigbrotherdish
behaviour. Uh, here's, uh, I'm
not gonna go into the

00:11:12.639-->00:11:17.477
methodology of each one of the
sources but I am gonna go pass
through the, th, the sources:

00:11:17.477-->00:11:21.648
here's OUNI - Open Up
Observatory of Network
Interference. I encourage you to

00:11:21.648-->00:11:27.453
go online and check out their
methodology. Uh, very, very
oriented to Asian and Middle

00:11:27.453-->00:11:34.460
Eastern countries. Uh, the
Freedom House, freedom off the
net report, uh, which is yearly

00:11:34.460-->00:11:39.465
report were the Freedom House
evaluates the freedom of uh,
users online. Uh, it goes from,

00:11:41.901-->00:11:46.906
uh, free to partly free, to not
free. So, yellow to red means
that you're not doing a very

00:11:50.109-->00:11:55.114
good job. Similar to that - the
Web Foundation and Web Index.
The web index goes from one, one

00:11:57.450-->00:12:02.388
to zero, zero to one. So you see
from light green to, to red. The
same goes for the Open Net

00:12:04.524-->00:12:10.830
Initiative uh, it's a citizen
lab project, a little bit older
but, uh, but remains, remains

00:12:10.830-->00:12:15.835
valid because it reinforces the,
the, some of the perceptions,
some of the evidence that we

00:12:18.238-->00:12:24.811
collected prior to that. And
here, the access now that our
shutdown tracker - you only see

00:12:24.811-->00:12:29.849
India on the red here because in
the last three years India
reported over 150, uh,

00:12:29.849-->00:12:34.854
shutdowns. And all the other
countries actually reported less
than 30. So, it's kind of, uh,

00:12:38.157-->00:12:43.162
uh, of uh, outsider here, an
outlier here. In Brazil we had
our, our share of, of internet

00:12:45.365-->00:12:50.803
blocking - it's worth sharing
with you guys. Uh, it was
actually two, two different

00:12:50.803-->00:12:55.808
decisions from uh, uh two
different judges, uh, where the
wanted the, the WhatsApp, uh,

00:12:59.178-->00:13:05.818
cellular app to wiretap some
drug dealers. And when WhatsApp
said it couldn't be done because

00:13:05.818-->00:13:12.258
technically it couldn't be done,
uh, uh, the content wasn't at
their disposal. Uh, the judge

00:13:12.258-->00:13:17.230
thought it might convince
WhatsApp to do something about
it by blocking the app, uh,

00:13:17.230-->00:13:22.235
nationwide. So, that happened
for two times, two or three
days. Till eventually a higher

00:13:24.671-->00:13:30.343
court overruled the, the first
decision. But that's Brazil, you
know, you don't need a dictator

00:13:30.343-->00:13:35.348
to do these kind of things - you
get our judges doing it. But
never mind. [laughter]

00:13:38.017-->00:13:44.457
[clapping] Honestly. Thank you.
[clapping] On the, on the right
you see the countries that

00:13:44.457-->00:13:49.462
appeared, uh, in multiple
sources and you see that same
trend where South East Asian and

00:13:51.931-->00:13:56.936
Middle Eastern and North African
countries appeared. Uh, sites
that ran in China that you might

00:13:59.372-->00:14:05.011
imagine Saudi Arabia, Vietnam,
Turkey, uh, Ethiopia are
countries that are recurring

00:14:05.011-->00:14:10.016
appearing on the data that we
collected. And we go finally to
idea of, uh, transparency

00:14:12.318-->00:14:17.323
reports. It's interesting one,
we already, uh, 70, uh, 70
transparency reports published..

00:14:20.660-->00:14:25.665
Uh, we only, uh, actually
analyzed ten of the major
providers due to, uh, lack of

00:14:29.001-->00:14:35.975
human resources. Uh, but the
average for requests to have
some data produced was 64

00:14:35.975-->00:14:41.881
percent which is, shows why
countries are actually
interested in, in demanding that

00:14:41.881-->00:14:46.886
from social media. And overall
125 have already requested
information of removal content.

00:14:50.523-->00:14:55.528
So, it's a pretty popular way to
get information regarding your
targets. This, a map of the

00:14:58.498-->00:15:03.436
concentration of, uh, requests,
uh, the different social media
requests. You see there is much

00:15:09.008-->00:15:14.480
more Western-oriented, most
likely because most of the
social networks have Western

00:15:14.480-->00:15:19.485
users. So, I, uh, uh, we
attributed the result to that.
But, when we look at the numbers

00:15:21.754-->00:15:28.394
and we selected 5 countries, we
selected Brazil, India, Mexico,
Poland and Turkey as a

00:15:28.394-->00:15:35.067
representation of different
regions. We see, uh, a light
trend going up which means, uh,

00:15:35.067-->00:15:44.410
these countries have requested
more information over the years
but we do see a country stand

00:15:44.410-->00:15:49.215
out, and that's Turkey. And we
check it out, the numbers, only
for Turkey it's interesting to

00:15:49.215-->00:16:00.459
see that going up from 2013 and
on, Turkey has really spiked the
requests. And that coincides to

00:16:00.459-->00:16:05.431
the political crackdown that
re-elected president Erdogan,
uh, it's playing out in the

00:16:05.431-->00:16:13.306
country. So, maybe this is uh,
uh, our evidence that cyberspace
is actually being used to

00:16:13.306-->00:16:21.914
impose, uh, uh,uh, to, to limit,
uh, civil society. And I draw
your attention to the bottom

00:16:21.914-->00:16:28.354
right graph - that's exactly,
uh, the removal, uh, requests
that Twitter recieved. That's a

00:16:28.354-->00:16:35.461
percentage of how many requests
were issued by Turkey regarding
the whole world. The, the total

00:16:35.461-->00:16:43.536
amount of requests from Twitter
- so, from 2013 on Turkey
responded for 30, 40 and finally

00:16:43.536-->00:16:50.710
50 percent of all removal, uh,
requests. SO, it's a, it's a
pretty big number if you think

00:16:50.710-->00:16:56.782
about it. Turkey, uh, 80 million
country, maybe 40- 50 million
u-, internet users, maybe even

00:16:56.782-->00:17:04.090
less Twitter users. So it's a,
maybe it's a, it's a, it's a
good evidence of statesman'

00:17:04.090-->00:17:13.866
behaviour, uh, towards social
media. [coughing] And while, now
some final remarks. As you guys

00:17:13.866-->00:17:21.841
can see, I really love maps, so.
[laughter] This is just the last
one where, no, actually not the

00:17:21.841-->00:17:25.678
last one but one of the last
ones where I put all the layers
together on cyber, uh,

00:17:25.678-->00:17:31.784
capabilities, uh, you see in
orange countries with state
sponsored APTs. And then in, o,

00:17:31.784-->00:17:38.958
in yellow and green - countries
with intelligence and military
capabilities. And in purple -

00:17:38.958-->00:17:43.663
countries with law, law
enforcement; light green -
civilian. And you can see it's

00:17:43.663-->00:17:49.302
very diffuse - we can look and,
and think like Joseph Night said
- it's a diffusion of power, it,

00:17:49.302-->00:17:56.776
it really is and many countries
do possess this capability. And
when we think about this in a

00:17:56.776-->00:18:04.016
perspective of internet users,
uh, 54 percent of internet users
actually live in countries that

00:18:04.016-->00:18:10.456
already had state-sponsored
attacked. And if we scale it up
to include intelligence agency

00:18:10.456-->00:18:17.430
that reach 65 percent. And if we
go full stack, anyone who has
some sort of capability,

00:18:17.430-->00:18:25.771
potential one, that's 92
percent. That's pretty much
everyone, uh, it means we're all

00:18:25.771-->00:18:32.645
in it together. Uh, and the
second, uh, kind of misbehaviour
that we classified here as

00:18:32.645-->00:18:40.987
censorship and blocking - it's
much more oriented towards, uh,
In, Asia and, and Africa and you

00:18:40.987-->00:18:45.558
can see that a strong
correlation between, uh,
censorship and internet

00:18:45.558-->00:18:54.600
shutdowns. We can see 26
countries doing both of the
things. And 60, and 50, and 56

00:18:54.600-->00:19:02.041
percent of users online are
subject to this. And while
DefCon is here, talking about

00:19:02.041-->00:19:11.550
1983 and we are closing in to
1984 and the evidence that we
brought, uh justifies that we

00:19:11.550-->00:19:18.724
are actually are there and many
of the countries are actually
living already in 1984. And

00:19:18.724-->00:19:24.764
this is the best place so we can
be aware of this, and think of
creative solutions so we can

00:19:24.764-->00:19:31.137
help them. Uh, and maybe our
daily lives does, doesn't
reflect really this, this kind

00:19:31.137-->00:19:34.507
of state misbehaviour. But we
should all be aware that it's
out there. It's happening right

00:19:34.507-->00:19:38.778
now and we should do something
about it. I thank you for your
patience. I thank you for your

00:19:38.778-->00:19:46.652
time. I'll leave my contacts.
Please. [applause] Please, if
you have. [applause] Thank you!

00:19:46.652-->00:00:00.000
[applause]
