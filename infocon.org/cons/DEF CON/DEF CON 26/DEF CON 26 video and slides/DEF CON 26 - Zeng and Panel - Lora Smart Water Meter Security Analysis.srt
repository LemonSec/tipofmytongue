00:00:00.868-->00:00:06.573
>> Hey everybody, welcome to
DefCon! [applause] [whoop]
[whistles] Alright, we got LoRa

00:00:06.573-->00:00:12.946
Smart Water Security Analysis.
This is your presenter Jun Li,
give hm a, give him a warm

00:00:12.946-->00:00:17.951
welcome! [applause] >> Thanks.
Thank you everyone, uh, first,
uh, I would like to, uh, I would

00:00:20.687-->00:00:25.692
like to clarify that this work
is not only done by myself, it
was done, mainly done by my, my,

00:00:29.363-->00:00:36.003
my team, my team members. And
one of the members, uh, because
the US consulate rejected, uhm,

00:00:36.003-->00:00:41.008
his visa so, he not, he cannot
be here. So, yea, uh, every year
we got speakers rejected, uh,of

00:00:44.912-->00:00:51.151
the visa, I think, uh, this
gentlemen might be, uh, a big
national security threat for

00:00:51.151-->00:00:56.223
the, the United consulate.
[laughter] Okay, I'm going to
record a short video for him

00:00:56.223-->00:01:01.161
just to get him, uhm, what it
feels to present in front of
such a huge bunch of, uh,

00:01:03.964-->00:01:08.969
hackers. So, everybody. [cheer]
Oh, just, sorry, sorry, sorry.
[clapping] [laughter] I, okay.

00:01:14.174-->00:01:19.179
[applause] Okay, let's shoutout
to Zeng Yingtao, his name is
Tao, okay. [cheering]

00:01:24.418-->00:01:27.788
[whistling] [applause] Okay,
thank you. [chuckle] Yea, yea,
every, uh, got many friends

00:01:27.788-->00:01:33.327
rejected. Uh, so, let me quickly
introduce my company and our
team. Uh, my, my team is called

00:01:33.327-->00:01:39.199
Unicorn Team we are doing
wireless security, hardware
security, and so on. And, uh, we

00:01:39.199-->00:01:45.138
are from, uh, the largest
security company called 360
Security Technology, in China.

00:01:45.138-->00:01:51.812
[sniff] And, uh, today I am
going to, uh, present how the,
the, the process we took to

00:01:51.812-->00:01:56.817
analyse this, this, uh,
so-called smart, "smart water
meter". So, this how it looks

00:01:58.885-->00:02:03.824
like in real life. So, uh, on
the net. You can see there, it's
like, just look like the normal

00:02:06.827-->00:02:11.832
water meter but there is a dial
- the red circle. So, that's
just like a magnet, so, when,

00:02:13.934-->00:02:19.706
when the water meter runs the
magnet will rotate and the there
will be a, uh, a magnet sensor,

00:02:19.706-->00:02:24.711
uh, ano-, under the cover on the
next slides, I will show you.
And on the right, is a, uh, a

00:02:28.615-->00:02:34.988
solar panel, solar panel
powered, uh, gateway way which,
uhu, just like relays, a, uh.

00:02:34.988-->00:02:41.795
Water meter data, uh, to the
server of the uh, the GPRS. But
communication between this water

00:02:41.795-->00:02:47.901
meter and the gateway is using,
uh, LoRa which is, kind of
prior-, Proprietary in, uh,

00:02:47.901-->00:02:52.906
protocol. And this is the, uh,
the camera of that water meter
we use to exploit there is the

00:02:55.876-->00:03:00.814
circuit board and there is, uhm,
an antenna and also there, this
is gateway which you can see

00:03:03.283-->00:03:08.288
there is, a, a, uhm. There's a,
uh, a GPRS module and then LoRa
transmitting module. So, this is

00:03:11.658-->00:03:16.663
uh, uh, actual the parameters
of, and the models of the chips.
So, you can see there is an, an

00:03:18.832-->00:03:23.837
NCU which is used to configure
the, uh, LoRa chip everytime it
pops up because, uh, this might

00:03:28.075-->00:03:33.747
be, uhm. So, we will later
introduce how we can, uh, attack
the communication between the

00:03:33.747-->00:03:39.019
MCU and the LoRa module and we
have that antenna parameter and
then the battery. So, this, uh,

00:03:39.019-->00:03:43.990
the way, why they are going o
use this LoRa, uh,
communication? Is because it's

00:03:43.990-->00:03:50.263
low-power, so, this uh, little
battery can power it up to 10
years. So, that's why they are

00:03:50.263-->00:03:55.268
using this. And there is a hard,
uhm, centre to like, to detect
the rotation of the magnet as I

00:03:59.272-->00:04:04.211
have here. So, I dunno if you
can see it. It's a pointer or
something? No. So, uh, there's a

00:04:08.815-->00:04:13.820
magnet sensor called TMR 3-0-1
that can detect, uh, water
meters, uh, when it's running.

00:04:16.790-->00:04:21.795
And, and, there, there is a MCU
to configure, uh, MCU is here to
configure this LoRa module, uh,

00:04:27.634-->00:04:32.639
chip. And this is a, a gateway
disassembly, so there is a, uh,
a GPRS module here, uh, the

00:04:35.175-->00:04:41.681
white, the white rectangle and
there is a LoRa module. So, it's
just like very typical

00:04:41.681-->00:04:46.686
architecture for IoT device. And
there's, there is a, a EEPROM
for to store the data of the,

00:04:51.258-->00:04:56.263
maybe to when it's, the GPRS to,
to maybe gather the water meter
data. And, uh. [cough] Actually

00:05:00.167-->00:05:05.172
the, the gateway used, used, and
implemented and using are
different, uh, chip but they are

00:05:08.208-->00:05:14.614
using the same chip as the, as
the water meter. So, uh they
have to use, because this is

00:05:14.614-->00:05:19.619
cheaper than to use another,
like chip dedicated to, for the,
for the gateway. Now, let's talk

00:05:24.925-->00:05:29.930
about how we can like infect
the, uh, the water meter data.
So, you can, as we said, it's

00:05:32.199-->00:05:38.471
just used detecting the rotation
of the magnets. So, we can use a
strong magnet to put it near

00:05:38.471-->00:05:43.476
the, the centre TMR 3-0-1 in the
centre to just to interfere the,
the signal. So you can see when

00:05:47.247-->00:05:52.252
the magnet, uh, rotate then the
rotate, uh, produced on the, uh,
the water meter in the centre

00:05:54.788-->00:05:59.793
will, will change. So, uh, we
can use a, you can see a if the.
You can see if the-. There's no,

00:06:07.000-->00:06:12.005
no pointer? Okay, o you can see
this when the magnet is in this
angle there is, a, a 400

00:06:14.808-->00:06:21.047
milliwatt voltage and when the
angle change the, the the water
change accordingly. So, uh, this

00:06:21.047-->00:06:27.153
how they can detect, uh, water
meter when it's running. So, we
use a strong magnet to interfere

00:06:27.153-->00:06:32.158
with this, uh, magnetic,
magnetic sphere so. Becuase the,
the cover is a plastic so it's,

00:06:34.227-->00:06:40.467
it's still working so you can,
hm, spoof the sensor data to see
that we're, we're not using any,

00:06:40.467-->00:06:45.472
uh, water. But this can be, uh,
caught if they come, come to
your house she, actually takes

00:06:48.975-->00:06:53.980
the,uh, a look at the, uh, the,
the, the water meter. So, that's
one way to, to spoof the sensor

00:07:01.087-->00:07:06.092
data. And another way is just
to, just to dis-, disassemble it
and use like the water

00:07:08.395-->00:07:13.400
deregulator to, uh, spoof the
water usage. It's the same, the
same effect. [mouse-click noise]

00:07:20.440-->00:07:25.445
So, the LoRa frequency is
different, uh, in each country,
so, this is, uh, for for example

00:07:28.381-->00:07:33.386
in the US is 915 uh, uhm,
megahertz. So, indeed other
countries are different, so when

00:07:36.589-->00:07:41.594
you're trying to like, to
research on this kind of met-,
LoRa based device you need to

00:07:45.165-->00:07:50.170
treat, maybe change your, your
HDR device in order to detect
that frequency in order to catch

00:07:52.305-->00:07:57.610
the signal. So, this is a.
Format of the packet, so you'll
have this parambole that will

00:07:57.610-->00:08:03.583
notify the receiver that the
packet's coming. And then you
have this, uh up chirp down

00:08:03.583-->00:08:08.588
chirp that will encoding data,
so, there, there, there's,
actually very pretty complex

00:08:10.757-->00:08:16.696
enough parameters where you need
to configure, so, uh, and when
we do, uh, wireless research,

00:08:16.696-->00:08:21.968
security research, we often use
like HDR. So, we have to
configure the parameters for,

00:08:21.968-->00:08:28.842
for, for the receiver or for the
decoder. So, there are many,
many sets of, sets of

00:08:28.842-->00:08:35.815
configuration so, uh, actually,
uh, researchers from the US
company [indiscernible] hey are

00:08:35.815-->00:08:40.820
doing, uh, wireless. So, they
did something to like, uh, uhm,
to decode the LoRa traffic but

00:08:44.591-->00:08:49.062
they're, we tried them, their,
their code but it's not working.
I guess it's, uh, because the

00:08:49.062-->00:08:54.067
configuration of the parameters
are different. So, we have to
write our own, uh. Decoding code

00:08:56.102-->00:09:01.041
for this, for this, uh, traffic.
So, actually we, uh, one of our
team member wrote, uh, the, the

00:09:04.077-->00:09:10.917
code to, uh, use, use in Mac lab
to decode the traffic and we
upload the, uh, this module to,

00:09:10.917-->00:09:16.823
the our GitHub, so if you are
interested in doing some more
LoRa research in the future you

00:09:16.823-->00:09:21.828
can go look at the code. That's,
this, it's turned out very easy
to use, so, uh, we. We reach to

00:09:25.398-->00:09:30.403
another method. So, actually,
uh, because I said as there is a
Mac MCU used to configure the,

00:09:33.273-->00:09:38.278
uh, LoRa module everytime is
put, it's powered down, so, what
it does, uh, it's using SPI

00:09:41.214-->00:09:46.219
communication to configure the,
the LoRa module. The, the cause
parameters which frequency they

00:09:48.922-->00:09:55.261
are and the, uh, the different,
uh, encryption factors,
something like that. So, we use

00:09:55.261-->00:10:00.266
the, the, this Nortek analyser
to uh, capture the traffic and
the serial, uh, communication,

00:10:04.103-->00:10:09.108
uh, interface and we can, uh, we
can figure out how this, uh, uh,
uh, LoRa front and LoRa

00:10:12.145-->00:10:18.718
transceiver are configured. So,
and then we just go and buy
another, uh, LoRa module and use

00:10:18.718-->00:10:23.623
the same configuration in order
to receive the, uh, in order to
decode the traffic. So, it's,

00:10:23.623-->00:10:28.628
it's pretty smart this kind of
thing. So, you have, once you've
go all the traffic, uh, on the

00:10:33.900-->00:10:39.506
serial com-, communication you
have to figure out what those
traffic means. So, we got this,

00:10:39.506-->00:10:45.812
uh, we figure out it by looking
at the documentation where this
is what kind of instruction we

00:10:45.812-->00:10:51.818
trust. So, for example. There
are this, when we receive this
traffic it means that we send

00:10:51.818-->00:10:56.823
the frequency to the. Uh, 490,
uh, 492 point and the 25
megahertz. That's the frequency

00:11:01.261-->00:11:07.100
we mentioned in the previous
slides where we see that there's
different country are using

00:11:07.100-->00:11:12.105
different frequency so you can
see this is, uh, the Chinese
frequency. Okay, we now, now we

00:11:16.643-->00:11:22.782
got the configuration, so we use
another module to configure it
the same way. And we can receive

00:11:22.782-->00:11:27.787
the traffic. Mh, okay, so now we
got the traffic, we have to
reverse engineer the

00:11:30.156-->00:11:36.729
communication protocol and see,
to see what, how they can
transmit the data. Uhm, yea,

00:11:36.729-->00:11:42.135
surprisingly we find it, that
not encoded it's just sent in
plain text perhaps it thinks

00:11:42.135-->00:11:47.140
that LoRa, uh, communication
it's by itself its very hard to
decode. So, this, they are using

00:11:49.375-->00:11:54.380
kind of, like, mh, their quite
ordinary uh, protocol. So, there
is a unique ID of each, uh,

00:11:59.719-->00:12:04.657
water meter. And, uh, actually,
we can spoof all the traffic.
And, uh, they are, are

00:12:08.127-->00:12:13.132
transmitting the, the water
usage data and the, also the
temperature. So, so, let's, uh,

00:12:16.903-->00:12:21.908
see if, uh, the privacy, privacy
risks. For example, if I say
that, uh there is no water

00:12:26.713-->00:12:33.019
usage, because the, the water
usage data is sent in, is
transmitted in plain text so we

00:12:33.019-->00:12:38.658
can actually save the data to
say that if somebody's at home
and using their, uh, water meter

00:12:38.658-->00:12:43.663
and the, or, and so we can
actually profile the habits of
this, uh, uh user. Uh, so to say

00:12:47.000-->00:12:52.305
if, uh, his working routine -
when he comes home and when he
leave for work, something like

00:12:52.305-->00:12:57.310
that. And, uh, we can also,
like. Uh, like, spoof the data
to make somebody like say, say

00:13:01.814-->00:13:06.819
they are using a lot of water
and get them overcharged. And,
uh... And we can also forward

00:13:11.090-->00:13:16.095
the, uh, forward the, uh,
gateway to ensure instructions,
for example the, uh, because

00:13:20.700-->00:13:27.674
this is like a [indiscernible]
two way communication, so not
only the water meter have to,

00:13:27.674-->00:13:32.679
uh, upload water usage data but
also there's the server like
issue some command to the, to

00:13:36.516-->00:13:41.521
the water meter. So, uh, we,
and, and also the LoRa is not
only used in, uh, water meter,

00:13:44.857-->00:13:49.862
so, it, they are using it to
control gas valves or other like
them. Or, you can just think

00:13:52.098-->00:13:57.103
like of similar kind, like GPRS
or GP. They can be used anywhere
to, to build a connected device.

00:14:00.306-->00:14:05.311
So, we, if we can, uh, get
traffic or spoof the traffic, we
can cause, uh, other chaotic,

00:14:11.651-->00:14:16.656
uh, consequences. So, this is
the, or like how the, the, the
communication links works. So,

00:14:20.960-->00:14:25.965
the water meter, uh, actually
send the data to the gateway and
the LoRa gateway, uh, transm,

00:14:28.935-->00:14:33.940
transmit and send the data to
the server using GPRS. And GPRS
might notice the traffic is

00:14:36.042-->00:14:41.781
that, that communi-,
communication is not safe.
Everybody maybe can sleeve or

00:14:41.781-->00:14:46.786
maybe spoof the traffic. So, we
can use like fake station to,
uh, spoof, to, uh, to attack

00:14:48.988-->00:14:53.993
those. To do man in the middle
or to just spoof the, the
gateway. And the. So, this is

00:14:58.698-->00:15:03.636
uh, my colleague trying to, uh,
like, spo-, uh, sleeve the GPRS
traffic so instead of this, uh,

00:15:06.405-->00:15:11.410
base station open using BT, uh,
openBTS and the, we managed to
get this, uh, gateway to

00:15:16.883-->00:15:22.889
communicate through our fake,
our fake base station. And
actually this is very common

00:15:22.889-->00:15:27.894
kind of attack. Especially,
especially in China. So, people
are using maybe like, like, uh.

00:15:30.129-->00:15:35.134
Uh, disk GPRS to unlock shared
bugs. So, people are used to
trying to spoof the, uh, unlock

00:15:38.805-->00:15:45.077
command to make the bug open
itself. Yea, so we are doing
that. This is kind of, very

00:15:45.077-->00:15:50.082
common, common techniques.
[couching] So, when we get the,
uh, when we got the base fake,

00:15:53.219-->00:15:58.124
the fake base station setup and
the, the way, the gateway
connect to our fake base station

00:15:58.124-->00:16:03.062
we can see what data it, it it's
sending to the, uh, to the
server. And when, we, we analyse

00:16:07.366-->00:16:12.371
it using Wireshark and to, and
to reverse engineer the, the,
the protocol used to, between

00:16:15.241-->00:16:20.246
the gateway and the server. So,
this is uh, uh how the, the
traffic look like. So you can

00:16:22.315-->00:16:27.320
see there the, uh, gateway ID,
there's a header. And a cont
code and also payload, so, and

00:16:31.224-->00:16:36.229
all kinds of information. Again
it's not, it's not encrypted -
it's just using a CRC to, to, to

00:16:38.564-->00:16:43.569
check this integrity of the
packet. So. So, we can actually,
as I've said, we can like

00:16:56.816-->00:17:03.456
explore for the gateway to fake
water meter data, uh, water
usage data to the server. So,

00:17:03.456-->00:17:08.461
nice, take a look at the
overall, uh, communication link.
The water meter to the gateway;

00:17:10.463-->00:17:15.468
the gateway to the server; and
the. So, we have, uh, reversed
engineered the, uh, tool

00:17:18.905-->00:17:23.910
communication link and the using
all kind of pri-, tool
proprietary communication

00:17:26.512-->00:17:31.517
protocol. So, the line is over
LoRa protocol, uh over LoRa;
another line is over GPRS. So,

00:17:36.923-->00:17:41.494
let's once again to see, this
whole, uh, like, testing
environment. We have have this

00:17:41.494-->00:17:46.499
magnet to interfere with the
magnet centre. We have this, uh,
Arduino module used to do, uh,

00:17:49.335-->00:17:54.340
configure the uh, module, LoRa
module we used to sleeve the
traffic. Because we have like

00:17:56.809-->00:18:01.747
reverse engineered the con, con,
configuration process of the,
uh, M-, M-, MCU to the. To the

00:18:06.252-->00:18:11.524
LoRa module. So, we can use
Arduino, Arduino to configure
our module to sleeve the

00:18:11.524-->00:18:16.529
traffic. And, uh, the next step
is to, to, like use openBTS to
reverse, to analyse the

00:18:19.565-->00:18:24.570
communication between. The
server and the, uh gateway. So,
conc, so, in, in conclusion that

00:18:31.944-->00:18:36.949
the, uh, we can see that, uh. So
there are, once again, like
sleeve privacy data to profile

00:18:39.719-->00:18:44.724
this user. And we can, uh,
actually use the data to forge
the, the data in each stage. The

00:18:50.796-->00:18:55.801
LoRa stage where the, the, the
water usage information
communication with the gateway,

00:18:58.371-->00:19:03.309
we can spoof traffic between the
gateway and the server. So,
actually, we, we, we uh,

00:19:09.215-->00:19:14.220
everytime we, we break something
we have to figure out, out a way
to actually remediate or just

00:19:17.523-->00:19:22.528
to, to, to remediate it. So,
this, uh, is using LoRa bin-,
binary, uh, protocol. This

00:19:30.836-->00:19:35.841
protocol is brought out by LoRa
alliance and, uh, uh. So, we can
use for example to prevent, uh,

00:19:43.616-->00:19:48.621
data from being, uh, spoofed or
forged we using message
integrity, in like maybe HashMap

00:19:50.723-->00:19:55.728
in like based on some kind of
encryption key to check the
integrity of the packets. We can

00:19:57.863-->00:20:04.003
also use, uh, like the
encryption, uh, I think, that
the. Why? Why didn't they use

00:20:04.003-->00:20:10.609
encryption in the first place?
Is because this is like quite
uh, a low-power application and

00:20:10.609-->00:20:15.614
the encryption may, may consume
a, a lot of power. So, that's
why they didn't like encrypt the

00:20:18.050-->00:20:24.256
water meter in the first place.
Or they just like think, like
obscurity, like security,

00:20:24.256-->00:20:29.795
something like that. They think
that LoRa is hard to decode,
it's not, it's not like the GPRS

00:20:29.795-->00:20:34.800
that you can easily. Like, like
to to spoof the traffic. So, so,
we can, we proof that we can

00:20:38.104-->00:20:43.109
steal network traffic so they
can improve, improve that the
sys, security by encrypting

00:20:45.478-->00:20:50.483
this, uh, traffic in each state.
So, we, we have this, uh, this
is actually the LoRa, uh, uh,

00:21:01.794-->00:21:06.799
standard by LoRa alliance and
everybody can look at it. They
are, they are like the secure,

00:21:10.069-->00:21:16.876
uh, measures but it seems that
they are failing it. So, we, so
anybody have any questions?

00:21:16.876-->00:21:21.881
This, this is a reference, uh,
the past here reassures they
have done a, a great job

00:21:24.049-->00:21:29.054
providing people with the, the
code to decode the, the LoRa
traffic. And we have this, uh,

00:21:31.957-->00:21:36.962
visual resources. So, anybody
having, has any questions? Or
no? Okay, you, you. [off-mic

00:21:46.839-->00:21:51.844
question] [applause] Uh, okay, I
will, I will try my best to
answer your question. Shoot.

00:22:05.858-->00:22:11.163
[off-mic question] How can a
company protect their
infrastructure? [off-mic

00:22:11.163-->00:22:16.168
question] Uh, they have already
deployed infrastructure, how can
they protect that? Yea, I don't

00:22:19.572-->00:22:25.144
think they can, they can
actually do that because
usually, usually with this kind

00:22:25.144-->00:22:30.149
of communication they don't have
over air update mechanisms so
you have to maybe replace, uh,

00:22:33.886-->00:22:38.891
infrastructure. So you have to
think of security at the, in the
first place. Or you can just,

00:22:42.194-->00:22:47.199
like, for example the magnets
that we, that you can change the
plastic cover to, uh, like,

00:22:49.702-->00:22:56.375
metal, metal cover so that will
be preventing some of the use
of, uh, interfere with magnet

00:22:56.375-->00:23:03.082
sensor using a strong magnet.
So, if, if somebody don't want
to pay water fee they just put

00:23:03.082-->00:23:08.087
this magnet and the water meter
so it's not running, so yea. So
anybody, anybody else has

00:23:15.628-->00:23:19.498
question? [audience noise] Okay,
thank you! [applause]
