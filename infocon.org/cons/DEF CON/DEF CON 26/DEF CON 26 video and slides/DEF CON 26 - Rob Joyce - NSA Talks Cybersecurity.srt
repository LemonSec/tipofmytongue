00:00:00.100-->00:00:03.770
>> And right now I’m gonna hand
you off to a speaker for Rob
Joyce. Again let’s give him a

00:00:03.770-->00:00:08.775
big DeCon welcome. [applause] >>
Well good morning everybody.
Thanks for having me here. Um

00:00:14.615-->00:00:21.054
for those of you who don’t know
me, Rob Joyce. I’m from NSA. 29
years at NSA. Um one of the

00:00:21.054-->00:00:25.826
proudest things I did was I had
to the chance to lead the
hackers of NSA organization

00:00:25.826-->00:00:31.265
known as TAO, um but I have also
worked on the defensive side of
NSA as the deputy director for

00:00:31.265-->00:00:37.170
information assurance. And uh
for 14 months I was down at the
White House leading leading

00:00:37.170-->00:00:42.409
cyber security policy for the
nation. Um, so it’s with kind of
that background I’m going to

00:00:42.409-->00:00:48.282
talk a bit today about where
we’ve been in cyber security,
the things that that are on top

00:00:48.282-->00:00:54.755
of my mind and the things we’re
focused um from NSA. So last
year I didn’t make DefCon. It

00:00:54.755-->00:00:59.760
was the first one I’ve missed in
several years. Um I was really
disappointed because I thought

00:00:59.760-->00:01:04.064
there was something important
going on here and that was the
election hacking village and uh

00:01:04.064-->00:01:08.969
I will be out there tomorrow and
make a chance to go see and earn
and and focus on that. That’s

00:01:08.969-->00:01:13.774
one of the reasons um I’ve
really stayed, tried to stay
connected with the DefCon crowd

00:01:13.774-->00:01:18.779
and come here every year. Is um
to be a part of some of the
creative ideas, innovation and

00:01:21.214-->00:01:26.720
the things that are uncovered
and learned here. Um it’s it’s
not apparent to everyone in the

00:01:26.720-->00:01:31.058
outside world I think why it’s
important to break stuff, why
it’s important to focus on it

00:01:31.058-->00:01:36.363
and find those flaws and then
talk about it. And I know even
today, there was some uh, there

00:01:36.363-->00:01:40.367
was some discussion with the
with the states about whether we
should be doing the election

00:01:40.367-->00:01:45.372
hacking village or not. Um
believe me there are people that
are going to going to attempt to

00:01:45.372-->00:01:50.610
find flaws in those machines um
whether we do it here publicly
or not. So I think it’s much

00:01:50.610-->00:01:55.949
more important that we get out
look at those things and and
pull on it. So that’s um,

00:01:55.949-->00:02:00.887
thanks. [applause] So the other
reason I’m here is again to be
part of this community, um, so

00:02:05.559-->00:02:10.764
what you will find whether you
know it or not there there are
and have been and will be NSA

00:02:10.764-->00:02:15.002
people involved in DefCon
throughout the years. Um you
know I’m up here and there’s no

00:02:15.002-->00:02:20.340
horns on my head. I’m a real
person, I’m a technologist at
heart. Um if you want to see

00:02:20.340-->00:02:25.145
kind of the things that get me
pumped and excited tomorrow at
noon, I’ve got another talk, I’m

00:02:25.145-->00:02:29.616
talking about my house and a
Christmas light display I put on
every year building absurd

00:02:29.616-->00:02:33.353
Christmas lights, um that one
actually might be more
interesting. I shouldn’t say

00:02:33.353-->00:02:37.324
that as you sit here and lis-
about to listen to this talk.
[laughter] But that’s uh that’s

00:02:37.324-->00:02:42.396
a cool talk, so come over to
DefCon 101 tomorrow. It’s not in
the program, it’s an ad, so I’m

00:02:42.396-->00:02:47.401
happy to be able to do that. So
so why am why why am I and
others at NSA. Um, it it really

00:02:49.903-->00:02:56.143
is uh to focus on that
technology and think about um
serving the country and and and

00:02:56.143-->00:03:02.783
providing a a way to make this
place safer. Because as I talk
throughout this morning you’ll

00:03:02.783-->00:03:07.821
hear and I hope you’ll agree
that there are some really bad
things, some bad trends going

00:03:07.821-->00:03:13.193
on. Um on the internet and
through through cyberspace. And
and I feel like each and

00:03:13.193-->00:03:18.265
everyday I get a chance to push
back on some of that and really
try to drive toward better uses

00:03:18.265-->00:03:24.671
toward that internet community.
So um the year after Snowden,
um, when it was a no feds

00:03:24.671-->00:03:30.277
allowed, I came to DefCon um I
didn’t come on NSA’s nickel, I
didn’t come as a fed, I came as

00:03:30.277-->00:03:37.084
Rob Joyce. But to stay involved
in the community. Um i think uh
it was uh it was interesting

00:03:37.084-->00:03:41.955
that a lot of people knew me.
I’d done meet the fed panel
previous year. So they looked at

00:03:41.955-->00:03:48.428
me and knew I was from NSA, but
I was still greeted and part of
the community that was going on

00:03:48.428-->00:03:54.668
here, so that was pretty cool.
It was uh it was notable that
you know I think it was two year

00:03:54.668-->00:03:59.906
ago I was going up in the in the
elevator to a sky talk and
somebody turned and said, hey

00:03:59.906-->00:04:04.978
aren’t you that NSA guy that
talked to our cyber security
club. So um all the heads in the

00:04:04.978-->00:04:09.049
elevator snapped around, they
looked at me. [laughter] And I
owned it, I said yeah,

00:04:09.049-->00:04:13.220
absolutely. And we started a
conversation with the whole
group there, right. And and that

00:04:13.220-->00:04:17.958
is um that’s what I want you to
see if you see me in the halls,
come up, have a conversation.

00:04:17.958-->00:04:23.630
We’re real people. I know not
everybody at DefCon agrees um
with NSA and our mission and and

00:04:23.630-->00:04:29.336
the types of things uh that that
are said about us in the press
sometime, but I’m hoping I will

00:04:29.336-->00:04:33.473
show you that you know there
really is noble intent, there’s
important things to be done. And

00:04:33.473-->00:04:38.478
and we’re invested in doing
those kind of things. So um, let
me, let me hop straight into it,

00:04:40.614-->00:04:46.052
for those of you are un-
unfamiliar with NSA, um there’s
really two sides to NSA. There’s

00:04:46.052-->00:04:51.825
a signals intelligence mission
that’s focused on um getting out
there and pr- producing

00:04:51.825-->00:04:56.663
intelligence on threats to the
country for decision makers, for
the law enforcement, the

00:04:56.663-->00:05:01.434
military and trying to pursue
that. And then there’s the
information assurance side that

00:05:01.434-->00:05:07.641
does cyber security um for our
national security systems. The
highest levels of of information

00:05:07.641-->00:05:12.946
that we in the US government has
to protect. So with that is the
basis of kind of where I am

00:05:12.946-->00:05:19.186
coming from. I’ll jump into
where I think things are going.
So so I’ll start here with this

00:05:19.186-->00:05:24.191
slide that talks the inflection
points of the uh the technology
landscape. Some pieces of that,

00:05:26.459-->00:05:33.266
one um wireless devices abound.
They’re really really growing
and and uh and exploding in the

00:05:33.266-->00:05:39.973
ecosystem. Another big thing is
people are choosing to supply
their data. Choosing to supply

00:05:39.973-->00:05:45.111
their data to those massive
social media sites um and and
what’s happening there it’s

00:05:45.111-->00:05:51.384
funding much of the web and
shaping the ecosystem with that
big data analysis and and the

00:05:51.384-->00:05:56.523
advertising that they can serve
up. And so you gotta kind of
think about that in terms of the

00:05:56.523-->00:06:01.261
the direction technology is
going because that’s what’s
funding a lot of this and so if

00:06:01.261-->00:06:07.500
if you don’t acknowledge and
understand those components, um
you’re you’re going to miss the

00:06:07.500-->00:06:12.806
boat about where technology is
going. So if you look at the
technology explosion from the

00:06:12.806-->00:06:19.512
2000s to today, there’s some
really big points. Um 2015, we
broke through the point where

00:06:19.512-->00:06:25.252
half the population of the world
is online. That is all the
people in impoverished countries

00:06:25.252-->00:06:30.257
to the wealthy and
sophisticated, high end
technology companies, um half of

00:06:30.257-->00:06:35.762
those people have access to the
internet by some means. And in
2014 mobile internet surpassed

00:06:35.762-->00:06:40.100
the fixed internet. So we’re
living on that cell phone
device. And if you think about

00:06:40.100-->00:06:45.438
it those mobile devices go with
us, they know where we are. Um
they’re connecting us, but it

00:06:45.438-->00:06:50.443
also um they’re really powered
by the backend, big data um that
that exists in the cloud and and

00:06:53.346-->00:06:57.584
that is a feature and an aspect
of where we’re headed in
technology that you’ve got to

00:06:57.584-->00:07:03.390
consider in how we’re doing uh
security. So for us in the US,
more than any other nation I

00:07:03.390-->00:07:09.429
would say, we depend on the
availability, the integrity, the
authentic- the authenticity, the

00:07:09.429-->00:07:16.269
information on those nets and
really unfortunately, those
vulnerability to exploit um

00:07:16.269-->00:07:21.908
those networks are are being um
being exploited by criminals in
nation states and so we’ve gotta

00:07:21.908-->00:07:26.913
think about um what we need to
do to change some of those
dynamics. Um, I talked to the

00:07:31.084-->00:07:36.089
technology, now let’s talk about
the environmental changes. Key
aspect for me is um in the

00:07:38.825-->00:07:43.830
nation state arena, the focus
has moved from using the realm
of cyber to steal secrets, to

00:07:46.266-->00:07:51.271
using that realm to impose
national power. Um, notable big
incidents last couple years we

00:07:54.107-->00:08:00.547
had huge data breaches, we’ve
had things um going all the way
back OPM and Aetna. We had the

00:08:00.547-->00:08:07.087
the Russia malware against
infrastructure with VPN filter.
And of course the Russian

00:08:07.087-->00:08:12.092
information operations election
hacking activities. Um, we’re
seeing nations use the internet

00:08:14.294-->00:08:19.899
um a- as their place to impose
those national th- those focus
of national power. So on the

00:08:19.899-->00:08:25.405
slide I kind of move from
espionage focused ops to a
growing trend of large scale

00:08:25.405-->00:08:30.877
destruction. And you all lived
through a couple of big notable
internet events in the last

00:08:30.877-->00:08:37.083
couple years. I also think it’s
noteworthy how numb we’ve
become, right, when a

00:08:37.083-->00:08:42.088
cryptocurrency exchange in Japan
lost 535 million dollars in uh,
in a cyber theft, so this may be

00:08:45.225-->00:08:50.163
skewed because of the audience
we’re in. But how many heard of
that in January where you know

00:08:50.163-->00:08:55.301
half a billion dollars of
cryptocurrency was taken. So
it’s, it’s a pretty heavy group

00:08:55.301-->00:09:00.340
in this room. Um, if you ask the
average person on the street,
not as much and I think it’s

00:09:00.340-->00:09:05.311
incredible that you know half a
billion dollars walks out. If
that happened and it was a truck

00:09:05.311-->00:09:10.750
load of gold stolen from a bank,
imagine above the full
headlines, but ho hum another

00:09:10.750-->00:09:16.356
cryptocurrency, um you know
session was uh was hijacked,
they lost a half a billion

00:09:16.356-->00:09:23.329
dollars. Um, we we’re really
growing numb in that. There were
also pretty concerning reports

00:09:23.329-->00:09:29.169
back in January that caught my
attention. Um that was the
Triton malware reports. If you

00:09:29.169-->00:09:34.174
think about the the targeting of
safety systems and industrial
control in big industrial

00:09:36.476-->00:09:42.615
processes, um, that is um that’s
activity that you’ve got to
start to wonder about the

00:09:42.615-->00:09:48.254
judgement. Um that came to light
not because somebody was really
investigating and found it

00:09:48.254-->00:09:52.192
through extensive cyber
sleuthing, it came to light
because they weren’t doing a

00:09:52.192-->00:09:57.197
really good job in that uh, in
that safety system and caused
notab- notable outcomes. Um so

00:09:59.265-->00:10:04.304
so to me, the judgement of those
people who thought they should
be screwing around with a safety

00:10:04.304-->00:10:09.676
system without the knowledge and
capability to actually manage
and shape it um in the way that

00:10:09.676-->00:10:14.647
they were seeking, um just just
shows how dangerous they are in
that and it probably should

00:10:14.647-->00:10:19.652
scare each and every one of you.
I know it scared me to think
about the folks going into that.

00:10:19.652-->00:10:26.526
So we’re also seeing countries
use their national power in
other way. Um, China’s using its

00:10:26.526-->00:10:32.432
cyber infrastructure to
establish a social control
system. Alright, the the the um

00:10:32.432-->00:10:38.171
social credit system that
they’re rolling out. So that’s
another way to use the power of

00:10:38.171-->00:10:44.911
cyber technology again for some
of the national aims. And so you
know for me the way it compares

00:10:44.911-->00:10:50.850
and contrasts the free world to
some of the totalitarian regimes
is how we’re using those those

00:10:50.850-->00:10:57.490
elements of technology to either
defend against abuses or prop up
some of the social injustices

00:10:57.490-->00:11:01.661
that are happening. So you got
to be aware of the new threat
landscape. The tools are

00:11:01.661-->00:11:07.500
available, the datas out there,
the intent exists and that’s
intent uh the trajectory of that

00:11:07.500-->00:11:12.705
intent is the piece that worries
me. I think nations states and
criminals opposed to some of our

00:11:12.705-->00:11:17.243
basic social order are having
their way in the digital domain
and I would lumb the election

00:11:17.243-->00:11:24.050
hacking and other things into
that as well, so make no
mistakes um a a big concern is

00:11:24.050-->00:11:28.955
the the chance for
miscalculation is huge and
whether it’s trying to influence

00:11:28.955-->00:11:33.660
our elections or intrude on the
safety systems of industrial
plans, that’s something we as a

00:11:33.660-->00:11:38.665
community kind of have to rally
against and and deal with. So
continuing on the cyber threats,

00:11:42.602-->00:11:47.607
um, I’ll talk about four major
trends that that uh that that
are um on my radar. Criminal and

00:11:51.110-->00:11:56.115
foreign adversaries constantly
prowling this digital domain, um
they they they push on America’s

00:11:59.018-->00:12:04.591
digital infrastructure
continuously um and those of
other places in the world. First

00:12:04.591-->00:12:09.963
area, um high end sophisticated
actors, there’s really been a
fundamental shift in the

00:12:09.963-->00:12:14.467
nation’s state activities of
those to free and open
societies. Right, aggressive,

00:12:14.467-->00:12:19.472
disruptive cyber operations um
asymmetric intrusions inflicting
damage. Um rapid weaponization

00:12:23.576-->00:12:28.648
of disclosed capabilities. These
state sponsored actors are
continuously building on the

00:12:28.648-->00:12:34.287
technique, so what we’ll see is
some elite folks at the high end
of that um coming up innovating

00:12:34.287-->00:12:40.326
but quickly propagating that at
scale um to other folks who can
who can use it and turn it. Um

00:12:40.326-->00:12:47.100
people fear zero day exploits,
but really hiding in the account
of an author- unauthorized user

00:12:47.100-->00:12:53.339
is much more hard to ferret out
um over the long hall, using a
authorized process(es) in ways

00:12:53.339-->00:12:59.712
that that weren’t intended. And
and so that that expertise of
the high end folks who can

00:12:59.712-->00:13:04.651
figure out who to indidous
insistuously get theirselves
into your process(es) you your

00:13:07.420-->00:13:13.493
data as an authenticated user,
um it’s really hard to uh hard
to deal with. So we’re seeing

00:13:13.493-->00:13:19.532
those big splash cyber events
with increasing frequency. Kind
of reinforcing that numbness. Um

00:13:19.532-->00:13:26.139
and as I discussed earlier, um
just getting common place.
Second area, um the level of

00:13:26.139-->00:13:31.477
expertise is just decreasing.
You know the the quality of
tools released the ability to

00:13:31.477-->00:13:36.482
get and build yourself on the
shoulders of others, um and get
out there is um is um really a

00:13:39.118-->00:13:45.191
leverage factor in enabling bad
activity that’s going on. So
most advance members of some of

00:13:45.191-->00:13:51.497
these overseas groups create the
trade craft and then again bring
others along, um unhinged to

00:13:51.497-->00:13:58.304
responsibly guide the use of
those activities. Third area I’d
highlight, um the move from

00:13:58.304-->00:14:05.244
exploitation to disruption. So
the last two years a number of
uh destructive attacks uh top of

00:14:05.244-->00:14:11.417
mine for me is uh Russia
targeting Ukraine in their
ongoing conflict. They wound up

00:14:11.417-->00:14:15.988
inflicting on the world with
Wannacry, right it was aimed at
Ukraine did a supply chain

00:14:15.988-->00:14:22.061
exploitation in the Ukraine um
but it quickly propagated to the
globe and if you look a

00:14:22.061-->00:14:27.066
significant number of maritime
ports were shut down. The
shipping channels disrupted. Um

00:14:29.268-->00:14:34.674
that’s real world physical
impact. The supply chain of our
modern businesses rely on those

00:14:34.674-->00:14:40.913
shipping channels. To follow a
predetermined predictive
timeline. And by shutting down

00:14:40.913-->00:14:47.019
those ports, impacting those
things, um it had huge impact
around the globe. There was a

00:14:47.019-->00:14:52.892
non-binding resolution on the UN
in 2015 where group of
governmental experts said, hey

00:14:52.892-->00:14:58.598
one of the important norms we
have to establish is um that we
won’t intentionally damage

00:14:58.598-->00:15:04.737
critical infrastructure. We’ve
seen um disruption of civilian
power, we’ve seen financial

00:15:04.737-->00:15:09.709
institutions, um knocked down.
We’ve seen a lot of preparatory
activity in credible

00:15:09.709-->00:15:14.714
infrastructure and that stuff
has no purpose other than
preparation for these types of

00:15:14.714-->00:15:21.287
attacks. And so that’s that a
trend line of the cyber threat
that that continues to worry me.

00:15:21.287-->00:15:27.193
Fourth area, um the growing use
of information operations
leveraging cyber intrusions and

00:15:27.193-->00:15:31.931
so that’s the story of where you
can get a hack, grab data,
weaponize that data and then

00:15:31.931-->00:15:36.936
make outcomes from that data. Um
every single day we’ve got
adversary producing campaigns,

00:15:39.105-->00:15:44.644
pursuing campaigns to achieve
those strategic outcomes. Um and
many of those campaigns have

00:15:44.644-->00:15:48.815
cyber components. Um when these
people take our intellectual
property in a big campaign, um

00:15:48.815-->00:15:50.817
any given single theft is just
that. It’s a theft, but when you
look at it as strategic intent

00:15:50.817-->00:15:52.819
over timeline, um that really is
a cumulative a- effect on our
national economy and uh national

00:15:52.819-->00:15:57.824
security implications really are
undeniable of campaigns that are
looking to affect our our uh

00:16:11.671-->00:16:17.944
intellectual property and
business chains. So in America
we have um the luxury of

00:16:17.944-->00:16:22.949
thinking about national security
as an away game. Right? I think
in by that I mean um many of the

00:16:25.551-->00:16:30.423
conflicts, wars and activities
in our lifetimes have taken
place oversees, we’ve been

00:16:30.423-->00:16:36.262
insulated form that. Um but
cyberspace has made it clear
that we’re no longer in an away

00:16:36.262-->00:16:42.501
game. The threat has really come
to us and and that you know as
cyber professionals or people

00:16:42.501-->00:16:48.441
interested in the technology, um
has to be a a fundamental truth
that you got to absorb and think

00:16:48.441-->00:16:55.414
about um how that changes um the
way we need to react and work.
So the new threat environment

00:16:55.414-->00:17:01.254
not only has that changes, but
the environment around it has
changed. I talked in the very

00:17:01.254-->00:17:07.260
first slide about information
technology game changers, um the
connectiveness of our life is

00:17:07.260-->00:17:13.199
exploding. Censors about around
us, if you think of the internet
of things, the amount data

00:17:13.199-->00:17:18.204
that’s um that’s pulled together
and we can expect criminal to go
ahead and look at exploiting or

00:17:20.873-->00:17:25.478
weaponizing that environment. So
it’s an escalating threat
environment that has me

00:17:25.478-->00:17:31.050
motivated to fundamentally look
at how we protect ourselves and
protect national security in

00:17:31.050-->00:17:37.290
that space. So I hope I’ve set
the table um for for the
background I don’t think any of

00:17:37.290-->00:17:41.360
that is hugely surprising, but
what I wanted you to do is kind
of walk with me thought to

00:17:41.360-->00:17:47.199
thought and and get a sense of
where that’s been and where
that’s going. So at NSA we’re

00:17:47.199-->00:17:52.204
lined up with those two missions
I explained earlier. Um what we
found is cyber security benefits

00:17:56.909-->00:18:01.781
from the union of those two
things. Um the signals
intelligence mission goes out

00:18:01.781-->00:18:06.385
and gets unique insights into
foreign threat actors, ensures
the the national security

00:18:06.385-->00:18:11.924
systems are equipped to defend
against those kind of trends I
talked about. Signals

00:18:11.924-->00:18:17.396
intelligence really is at the
core at NSA’s fundamental
advantage in doing security and

00:18:17.396-->00:18:22.134
so we can take and discover
threat intelligence on foreign
adversaries. We can inform our

00:18:22.134-->00:18:28.841
partners, DHS and others to go
out and take action in that
space. And and both tactically

00:18:28.841-->00:18:34.080
counter the day to day malicious
activities or support the the
entities that can go out in a

00:18:34.080-->00:18:39.185
more strategic environment and
to create and defend against
those who go after our freedoms

00:18:39.185-->00:18:45.391
and our and our institutions. So
we focus on providing deep
expertise to the U.S. government

00:18:45.391-->00:18:50.763
on the targets the technologies,
the cyber defence trade draft we
have to work. Um and there’s a

00:18:50.763-->00:18:55.935
lot of partnerships in that, so
in the U.S. government, um, we
approach these threats as a

00:18:55.935-->00:19:02.608
team. DHS provides a mitigation
role, um FBI does an
investigative role and then we

00:19:02.608-->00:19:07.613
underpin both of them with
support in the expertise in the
nature of the foreign threats. I

00:19:09.882-->00:19:15.955
told you I’d walk a little
through history too. Cyber
security at NSA’s been on the

00:19:15.955-->00:19:20.960
this this journey for awhile.
Um, we’ve been working on the
information systems and the con

00:19:24.330-->00:19:31.170
systems of national security
since 1953, so over 60 plus
years we’ve not only produced

00:19:31.170-->00:19:37.043
the security po- policies, but
we’ve done that hard work of
deploying and developing the

00:19:37.043-->00:19:40.946
secure products and services
that implement those policies
and that’s kind of a unique

00:19:40.946-->00:19:45.584
place to be, not only just
writing policies, but being a
practitioner of it. And that’s

00:19:45.584-->00:19:50.256
one of the things that helped me
at the White House was knowing
that what we do and how we do it

00:19:50.256-->00:19:55.261
and what others do against us on
top of writing that policy was
so beneficial. So in the 40

00:19:57.563-->00:20:02.201
years ago um we were in the
security business, it was
communication security or

00:20:02.201-->00:20:08.674
ComSec. That was really almost
exclusively about protecting
classified information at it

00:20:08.674-->00:20:13.679
travelled between two points. So
we wanted to keep it from un- uh
authorized disclosure. Um we did

00:20:15.815-->00:20:21.954
that by building very secure
black boxes right. Goes into
unencrypted, goes out encrypted,

00:20:21.954-->00:20:28.594
um hybrid encryption. Careful
engineering to protect that
information. In the 70s even the

00:20:28.594-->00:20:34.700
early 802 the advent of the
personal computer came around.
Um we had a new discipline for

00:20:34.700-->00:20:40.172
computer sec- security or
CompuSec. That was still focused
on protecting information from

00:20:40.172-->00:20:46.745
unauthorized di- disclosure, but
it also started address
additional challenges the uh the

00:20:46.745-->00:20:52.184
injection of malicious code or
the theft of large amounts of
data on magnetic tape. It was

00:20:52.184-->00:20:57.189
really a transition into that
new information realm. Um we saw
a big CompuSec contribution back

00:21:00.559-->00:21:05.030
then, there was the rainbow
series of books. These were
descriptions by the government

00:21:05.030-->00:21:10.035
telling everybody how we could
protect um um trusted systems,
evaluate them with guidelines on

00:21:12.438-->00:21:19.378
things like passwords. Um
audits, network databases, risk
management um it was stuff in

00:21:19.378-->00:21:23.616
the 70s and 80s we were talking
about doing. All the same
problems we’re talking about

00:21:23.616-->00:21:28.621
today right. Um I think um it
was the time where we’re first
questioning how you could um be

00:21:31.490-->00:21:36.929
sure a computer was doing what
it was supposed to do and
nothing more. Um that was a

00:21:36.929-->00:21:42.801
surprising question back in that
day it is not today. But it was
really was um a a fundamental

00:21:42.801-->00:21:48.507
pivot at the time. We realized
separately we’re dealing with
ComSec on one hand protecting

00:21:48.507-->00:21:53.512
information as it transited and
CompuSec, the computers and the
security there um an- and doing

00:21:56.015-->00:22:01.787
those separately was no longer
feasible. So we started working
InfoSec and quickly realized

00:22:01.787-->00:22:08.327
that that was also was not
enough that we had to worry
about um unauthorized

00:22:08.327-->00:22:14.500
modification the information
data integrity on top of just
the confidentiality. Um positive

00:22:14.500-->00:22:20.139
identification, authentication
and it became really important
that after transition

00:22:20.139-->00:22:25.211
transactions somebody couldn’t
say they were n- they were not
part of that transaction. So um

00:22:25.211-->00:22:30.216
the non-repu- non repudiation
portion in that. Um. I think
finally um eligible receiver was

00:22:34.320-->00:22:40.593
an exercise the government ran
in 1997. That was a key moment
in the US government's

00:22:40.593-->00:22:45.431
recognition of the
vulnerabilities of cyber space.
A red team playing as foreign

00:22:45.431-->00:22:51.770
adversaries were able to um
targe significant U.S. critical
infrastructure and it shocked

00:22:51.770-->00:22:56.909
the national level leadership
and you saw a big pivot on the
way we do security and even to

00:22:56.909-->00:23:01.513
the point you can probably point
at that and say that was one of
the fundamental um

00:23:01.513-->00:23:06.986
justifications for the
establishment of cyber command.
Um back in the day. So as we

00:23:06.986-->00:23:11.991
evolved we got um we got changes
um even beyond the information
assurance. NSA as I said

00:23:14.059-->00:23:19.965
leveraging the power of
intelligence and the defensive
folks. Um we we integrated those

00:23:19.965-->00:23:25.671
two missions at NSA.
Information, um assurance didn’t
go away, it really is an

00:23:25.671-->00:23:30.676
integrated whole um effort where
we inform from one hand and then
act with the other. So the

00:23:34.213-->00:23:39.218
SIGINT system was also setup to
work in operationally relevant
timeframes, where we had to

00:23:39.218-->00:23:44.156
product intelligence for the war
fighters. Um time and speed
mattered, the information

00:23:44.156-->00:23:49.128
assurance mission was often
about standards and evaluations
and other things that weren’t

00:23:49.128-->00:23:55.234
time bounded and so that’s where
we are today is um cyber
security on top of information

00:23:55.234-->00:23:59.538
assurance has gotten to the
point where it needs to be in an
actual in an actionable

00:23:59.538-->00:24:04.476
timeframe. So let me pivot over
to back over to the nation
states. Um there’s been a lot of

00:24:08.347-->00:24:13.352
talk about cyber norms. Um I
mentioned earlier in 2015 it was
a UN group of government experts

00:24:15.454-->00:24:21.794
that recommended a set of cyber
norms. Um those norms were
non-binding um but they were a

00:24:21.794-->00:24:26.565
significant step, because
nations came together, they
debated, revised and endorsed

00:24:26.565-->00:24:32.438
those norms. Um but norms are
only norms if people follow
them. Right, so norms are only

00:24:32.438-->00:24:35.774
norms if if people agree and are
executing that way. I think
though with all the discussion

00:24:35.774-->00:24:37.776
about norms, people should
generally agree that most
nations are behaving reasonably

00:24:37.776-->00:24:41.413
on the internet. I think there’s
four notable exceptions. Um, I’m
naming names here, right,

00:24:41.413-->00:24:46.418
calling them out. Um and and I
don’t think they’ll surprise
anybody at this conference and

00:24:52.224-->00:24:57.463
and I deal with them on a daily
basis to the point they just
flow off my tongue. Russia,

00:24:57.463-->00:25:02.401
China, Iran, North Korea. Um,
its its that its that uh that uh
that easy. Um Russia certainly

00:25:04.570-->00:25:11.143
their use in election in their
use of cyber in election infor-
uh interference information

00:25:11.143-->00:25:16.148
operations, military operations
doesn’t need an introduction. Um
Russia’s used cyber trade crafts

00:25:19.284-->00:25:25.491
and since at least 2008 um in a
big way. When the Russian
incursions into Georgia were

00:25:25.491-->00:25:30.996
accompanied by a denial of
service attacks un against a
Georgia internet service. Right,

00:25:30.996-->00:25:35.968
we saw that internationally as a
as a component um integrated
with the physical activities

00:25:35.968-->00:25:41.807
they were they were taking on.
So at NSA we’ve had a front row
seat to a lot of these

00:25:41.807-->00:25:48.213
activities. Our um our former
direc- director Rich Ledgett um
talked uh about a Russian

00:25:48.213-->00:25:52.684
intrusion into the state
department, he called it hand to
hand combat. Cause unlike a lot

00:25:52.684-->00:25:57.990
of places where you get an a a
intrusion and you’ve got an
incident response and uh the

00:25:57.990-->00:26:04.863
first sign that somebody’s um
following up on it the attackers
kind of disappear and an and and

00:26:04.863-->00:26:10.502
lock and run. Um what we saw
were these guys retarget the
system administrators. Try to

00:26:10.502-->00:26:16.141
lay down new tools, new
techniques in places that they
hadn’t been to hold that ground

00:26:16.141-->00:26:21.046
so it really was an interaction
it was kind of bold and
audacious as the fought to stay

00:26:21.046-->00:26:27.753
in that network um and and what
we see is that is um often the
the same way they as a state

00:26:27.753-->00:26:32.758
have responded. Ah um in in the
physical world. So so they mimic
that behavior. Um a good uh

00:26:36.762-->00:26:41.767
example of the insidious nature
of some of that intrusion, um I
would point to the May 2018 VPN

00:26:44.169-->00:26:49.174
filter right where Russia um
actors were targeting Soho
routers um we some APT28 Fancy

00:26:51.844-->00:26:56.849
Bear um called out in the Cisco
Talso reports estimated hundreds
of thousands of devices were

00:26:59.651-->00:27:06.058
affected worldwide. So that that
malware had really creative ways
of interacting. It went out and

00:27:06.058-->00:27:11.697
it was trying to get Instagram
pictures to decode out of the
metadata the IP address that it

00:27:11.697-->00:27:17.769
should use as a command and
control callbacks. And if those
those Instagram photos were

00:27:17.769-->00:27:23.175
unavailable, then it had a
domain name uh to know all dot
com that it would call out to

00:27:23.175-->00:27:28.514
and look for instructions. So
between the government, the
commercial industry, that was

00:27:28.514-->00:27:33.685
disrupted, those channels were
disrupted and you even saw FBI
warn everybody, reboot your

00:27:33.685-->00:27:39.291
devices, right? Disrupt the
Russians uh command and control
of this large army of bots we

00:27:39.291-->00:27:44.296
were gonna see. Um this was
effective at knocking down that
command and control but um and

00:27:46.798-->00:27:52.437
that’s the big but that I
haven’t seen really talked about
much. Um it’s that there was a

00:27:52.437-->00:27:57.743
persistent stage 1 on all those
routers. So what it did was
knocked it down if it was at a

00:27:57.743-->00:28:02.681
stage 2 or stage 3 implant, it
knocked it back to stage 1 which
was power reboot persistent um

00:28:05.083-->00:28:10.155
and then at that point it
couldn’t call back out to those
two via those two methods to

00:28:10.155-->00:28:14.860
re-establich command and
control, but the Russian malware
is actually still there. It’s

00:28:14.860-->00:28:20.632
still on those routers and if
you know the secret handshake
packet wake up knock, you can go

00:28:20.632-->00:28:26.171
in and you can still talk to and
control those routers and put a
stage 2 or 3 back on. So I guess

00:28:26.171-->00:28:31.276
I I’d ask you know what do you
think the odds are that the
actors in Russia who put those

00:28:31.276-->00:28:35.781
down kept a list of the IP
addresses that they put their
malware on. I think it’s pretty

00:28:35.781-->00:28:41.486
high. So what we really need is,
we need industry looking at an
easy way, because again these

00:28:41.486-->00:28:47.292
are consumer devices, these are
deployed that people can check
for that persistent backdoor.

00:28:47.292-->00:28:52.297
[cough] And that they can they
can knock it off their machines
in a real way. Right. That’s the

00:28:52.297-->00:28:57.803
kind of thing we’re up against
and that’s um that’s what I’m
talking about in the the way

00:28:57.803-->00:29:03.575
that they’re massively um
controlling and and and chasing
big parts of of the internet.

00:29:03.575-->00:29:08.580
Um. I think uh you know what we
in the government did with that
FBI warning. That was a

00:29:11.950-->00:29:18.790
battlefield medic putting a
turnacet on something, um, I’ll
leave that as a thought. So so

00:29:18.790-->00:29:23.795
summing up Russia, they seem the
most willing perhaps the most
skilled of our adversaries in

00:29:26.732-->00:29:31.737
seeking strategic outcome. Um
and in and through operations
that involve cyber space, but it

00:29:34.206-->00:29:39.911
doesn’t have to just exclusively
be cyberspace. When we’re
talking China, the immense

00:29:39.911-->00:29:45.651
volume of operations is the
thing that I I think that comes
to mind for most people first.

00:29:45.651-->00:29:52.290
So we see them stealing uh,
stealing uh intellectual
property and back in 2015 we got

00:29:52.290-->00:29:56.895
together, our government and
theirs to reach a commitment uh
that we wouldn’t steal for

00:29:56.895-->00:30:03.001
commercial profit. Um we would
start some cyber dialogues about
the the the security in the

00:30:03.001-->00:30:09.775
space and uh FireEye said we saw
90 percent drop off in cyber
intrusions after that agree-

00:30:09.775-->00:30:14.579
agreement was reached. From the
government uh we don’t have the
specific stats, but we saw a

00:30:14.579-->00:30:19.584
similar, comparable drop off. Um
but however kind of um like uh
like other intrusions China

00:30:24.022-->00:30:30.195
continues what they did was uh
certainly certainly became more
refined and even improved their

00:30:30.195-->00:30:36.835
tradecraft after learning from
some of those compromises. Um, I
would point to recent activity

00:30:36.835-->00:30:42.808
like the cloud hopper intrusions
where they’re targeting managed
service providers to get in and

00:30:42.808-->00:30:48.146
underneath a whole wide array of
businesses and then be able to
move through those MSPs to

00:30:48.146-->00:30:54.419
exploit the businesses above
them um as a sign that you know
they’re still in this space. So

00:30:54.419-->00:30:59.958
we’re focused on Cloud hopper
with other allies um other like
minded nations. And trying to

00:30:59.958-->00:31:05.797
work uh work out ways to get
them out of the infrastructure
layers um the that gives them

00:31:05.797-->00:31:12.804
big advantage. Um same thing
that the social credit um
services that they’re setting

00:31:12.804-->00:31:17.776
the social credit system
highlights the totalitarian
natures of the way they look at

00:31:17.776-->00:31:22.781
um the internet the technologies
and even um a long term focus on
the technologies that are gonna

00:31:24.850-->00:31:29.855
be pervasive. Whether it’s 5G or
um artificial intelligence,
quantum, those things show that

00:31:32.958-->00:31:38.530
they’re trying to stay ahead and
use that tactical advantage and
then even perpetuating a

00:31:38.530-->00:31:43.535
domestic legal regime where they
they have to have um
intellectual property transfer

00:31:45.670-->00:31:51.143
from companies who want to do
business with or in China. Um so
so participating in the Chinese

00:31:51.143-->00:31:57.482
markets using their national
laws to kind of edge people in
ways that are not exactly cyber

00:31:57.482-->00:32:04.122
but aimed at some of the same
outcomes, again theme here that
a lot of countries are looking

00:32:04.122-->00:32:10.061
at more than just cyber
operations. But cyber in part of
a bigger, larger activity. So

00:32:10.061-->00:32:15.066
Iran, um as US and Iran entered
into the nuclear agreement
framework talks. 2015. Um Iran

00:32:17.202-->00:32:22.808
really seemed to curtail a lot
of the the destructive cyber
activity against western

00:32:22.808-->00:32:28.346
interests. Um they still went
against Saudi, Saudi Aramco and
other big i- issues there. Um

00:32:28.346-->00:32:33.885
but w- we saw was denial of
service campaigns that had been
disrupting the banks and

00:32:33.885-->00:32:38.890
targeting the banking industry
dropped off a lot. Um they even
came after at one point um a Las

00:32:41.026-->00:32:47.332
Vegas casino, right, where the
CEO had made uh had made some
public statements about wanting

00:32:47.332-->00:32:53.538
to uh wanting to attack Iran and
so they took came back and
defaced um the the casino’s

00:32:53.538-->00:32:58.543
websites. So what we see is um
Iran willing to use their cyer
influence in uh in real world

00:33:03.448-->00:33:10.422
operations. Um at a level that
is targeted and malicious um
that we don’t see other states

00:33:10.422-->00:33:15.427
behaving um in similar ways. So
I think uh of notab- note you
know when when bilateral

00:33:17.829-->00:33:22.834
relations between Iran and Saudi
Arabia um decreased um we think
that was a major factor in the

00:33:25.136-->00:33:30.141
January 2017 data deletion
attacks in Saudi. Um and so you
know as we move to a point where

00:33:32.844-->00:33:39.384
the US has just re-imposed
sanctions on Iran, there’s a lot
of focus um on how are they

00:33:39.384-->00:33:44.189
going to respond and one
opportunity they have is
certainly in the cyber realm. So

00:33:44.189-->00:33:49.194
I know as NSA um we’re gonna be
very vigilant and uh watching
closely in that space. Um the

00:33:51.496-->00:33:57.636
world needs to join and and be
ready to push back if if that’s
a tactic and a and a way of

00:33:57.636-->00:34:02.574
acting that they’re gonna take
up um we’ve gotta be on guard.
And then over to DPRK, so I

00:34:05.977-->00:34:11.650
would say DPRK’s been some of
the most consistent, right. They
they haven’t shifted, um they’ve

00:34:11.650-->00:34:18.490
almost seen cyber as an
effective tools of state power.
But what we have is confirmation

00:34:18.490-->00:34:25.330
that that they’re going to use
cyber in every strategic uh
activity they have. Um when we

00:34:25.330-->00:34:31.169
put missile defense systems in
South Korea um one of the plans
of the US government was to

00:34:31.169-->00:34:37.742
expect cyber probing um cyber
efforts from DPRK to come at
those systems a- as they went on

00:34:37.742-->00:34:43.615
the peninsula. Um think the
disruptive attacks they’ve
undertaken against Sony well

00:34:43.615-->00:34:49.254
understood. Um but they’ve been
hitting South Korea banks,
infrastructure, government for

00:34:49.254-->00:34:54.259
several years. We would expect
um that to continue right they
they don’t have a lot to lose

00:34:56.461-->00:35:02.534
and there’s not a lot of levers
we can use in that space to
discourage it. The biggest place

00:35:02.534-->00:35:07.839
that they stand out amongst
nation states is um looking to
steal hard currencies. And they

00:35:07.839-->00:35:13.545
hit the bank of Bangladesh for
81 million dollars and theft
through the swift network. Um

00:35:13.545-->00:35:18.550
they continue to do um uh crypto
currency thefts. Um continue to
target banks looking to get hard

00:35:21.820-->00:35:26.825
western currency um and it it it
really um shows the the way that
as a nation state they’re

00:35:29.327-->00:35:34.733
they’re engaged in criminal
behavior. So where do we need to
be? Um cyber security really is

00:35:34.733-->00:35:36.735
a team sports. Um we in
government absolutely recognize
we can’t do this alone. Um if

00:35:36.735-->00:35:41.740
you look at strengthening cyber
security um it can’t be
something driven out of

00:35:45.944-->00:35:50.949
Washington DC. I think the
greatest progress happens from
the bottom up, not the top down.

00:35:55.453-->00:35:59.157
And that you know as I talked
about the election hacking
village and other things that go

00:35:59.157-->00:36:04.496
on in forums like this and in
companies in our industry it
it’s a place where we’ve got to

00:36:04.496-->00:36:09.501
be prepared and figure out how
to let that drive um from the
bottom up. NSA um has some

00:36:15.840-->00:36:22.480
unique expertise and
capabilities that we track um
and ornate across the overall

00:36:22.480-->00:36:29.354
federal efforts. Um there is
sector specific knowledge across
the federal government. Places

00:36:29.354-->00:36:34.492
like treasury who understand the
financial industry energy, who
understands the power industry

00:36:34.492-->00:36:41.132
that that we can supply cyber
expertise to and they know
domain issues. Um so that

00:36:41.132-->00:36:47.105
coordinated cross sector
government industry to protect
is vital. A good example of

00:36:47.105-->00:36:53.011
where industry brings knowledge
that we just don’t and won’t
have, um Microsoft recently

00:36:53.011-->00:36:59.284
highlighted intrusions against a
senator’s um e-mail. And and
what that shows is [cough] these

00:36:59.284-->00:37:05.857
companies like Facebook taking
down um Russian troll accounts.
They are going to know things on

00:37:05.857-->00:37:10.628
their platform and be able to
see things that the government
couldn’t and shouldn’t right and

00:37:10.628-->00:37:15.333
so there’s got to be this
connection as we work against
those government nation states

00:37:15.333-->00:37:20.238
that are behaving badly at the
federal level and they see some
of the things on their platform,

00:37:20.238-->00:37:25.243
there’s got to be this virtuous
cycle where there’s engagement.
I think uh um in in terms of

00:37:30.482-->00:37:37.088
social and and uh our our
society um the the Russian
election meddling the the

00:37:37.088-->00:37:42.594
Russian devisiveness they’re
trying to sow as top of mind. I
think uh many of you heard uh

00:37:42.594-->00:37:46.998
the director of NSA, General
Nakosone setup a Russia small
group. He brought together

00:37:46.998-->00:37:52.070
people across cyber command in
NSA um to focus in on this
problem and use intelligence

00:37:52.070-->00:37:57.075
capabilities we have. Um I think
it will be a key component of
enforming DHS who can, who can

00:37:59.644-->00:38:05.150
track to the state and locals um
what threats that are up against
that. Sharing th- um relevant

00:38:05.150-->00:38:11.422
threat intelligence with DHS um
getting it into the um
multi-state information sharing

00:38:11.422-->00:38:17.562
and analysis center. The
election ISACs, um other places
like that. So when it comes to

00:38:17.562-->00:38:22.867
Russia, the recent policy
pronouncements really made it
clear that any attempt um to go

00:38:22.867-->00:38:28.540
after our um and interfere with
our elections, successful or
unsuccessful, really is a direct

00:38:28.540-->00:38:33.478
attack on our democracy and it’s
unacceptable. So i think we’re
resourcing that. The national

00:38:33.478-->00:38:39.217
defense strategy laid out a role
for DOD and and you’re going to
see us um resourcing and pushing

00:38:39.217-->00:38:45.323
into that. So I’ve talked in the
past about the intrusion
lifecycle. I laid out you know

00:38:45.323-->00:38:50.461
as an attacker, the mindset of
an attacker. How you go against
a well defended hardened target.

00:38:50.461-->00:38:54.899
And you know you can argue about
the way stops in between, but
you basically have to cascade

00:38:54.899-->00:38:59.904
through these activities umm to
find your way and exploit and
and make use of systems. Um so

00:39:02.140-->00:39:07.979
there are points um on these
steps that we’ve got to think
with a defensive mindset about

00:39:07.979-->00:39:14.586
breaking up, interrupting and
and uh and disrupting their
their ability to have success.

00:39:14.586-->00:39:19.157
So it’s worth your time if
you’re involved in any sort of
defensive activity or you even

00:39:19.157-->00:39:24.362
want to protect yourself at home
to go after and look at this
kind of model and think through

00:39:24.362-->00:39:29.300
where are your weak points and
where can you harden. Cause what
you need is layer defense. Um

00:39:29.300-->00:39:35.240
one thing I can’t straight in
strong enough words really. The
basics matter. The basics

00:39:35.240-->00:39:41.646
totally matter. Um ignoring the
basics um gets you caught up in
massive cyber casualty effects

00:39:41.646-->00:39:48.553
like Wannacry. Um ignoring the
basics let a nation state
adversary tear into you. Um get

00:39:48.553-->00:39:54.292
to their objectives easily. Um
and and likely root into the
point where you’re gonna be hard

00:39:54.292-->00:40:00.765
pressed to know if they’re still
in after you remediate. Um the
basics give a beachhead for much

00:40:00.765-->00:40:06.704
harder follow on exploitation.
Um ignoring the basics will give
you a beachhead for that harder

00:40:06.704-->00:40:12.477
to follow on. So i think
regardless of the changes in
technology and there’s some

00:40:12.477-->00:40:18.383
really cool innovative defensive
things coming on, um if we don’t
have the discipline to stick to

00:40:18.383-->00:40:24.489
the basics um the cool stuff
really doesn’t matter. Um past,
present, future, it’s going to

00:40:24.489-->00:40:30.461
rely on doing the basics,
because no matter how skilled an
adversary is you know my time in

00:40:30.461-->00:40:36.100
the past at NSA, you only use
what you absolutely need. Right.
Attackers are gonna limit the

00:40:36.100-->00:40:41.472
sophistication of what they’re
doing. So in that you know,
there, there’s a host of thing

00:40:41.472-->00:40:47.712
um that we need to do. Um where
where it runs from locate and
get that multi-factor

00:40:47.712-->00:40:54.652
authentication out. It matters.
Um you know en- enabling,
logging, doing the analysis,

00:40:54.652-->00:41:01.225
paying attention. Um and and for
me I harped a lot in the USENIX
talk I gave years ago about

00:41:01.225-->00:41:06.097
knowing your network. Cause
attackers don’t care what you
think you have connected, um,

00:41:06.097-->00:41:12.136
they go after what you have
connected and if, you know, if
the if the shadow IT in your

00:41:12.136-->00:41:15.907
infrastructure gives them a way
in, they’re gonna take that,
they’re gonna use that

00:41:15.907-->00:41:20.912
opportunity and go on. So
reality of where we are is that
we’re all living on commercial

00:41:24.449-->00:41:31.189
technology. In the past the US
government used to build, used
to build black boxes, used to

00:41:31.189-->00:41:36.194
have isolated government
networks. Um we now live on that
same commercial technology um

00:41:38.629-->00:41:45.570
that banks, industry, critical
infrastructures and we as
citizens live on. Um a- and

00:41:45.570-->00:41:50.274
there’s a reason there’s a patch
Tuesday, right? The day that
stuff comes out is um the day

00:41:50.274-->00:41:55.279
that people start picking at it
and poking at it. It’s going to
overtime erode, um, and and

00:41:57.482-->00:42:02.920
people are gonna learn flaws, so
it’s important we keep up with
that. It’s not that this tech is

00:42:02.920-->00:42:07.925
either good or bad, we’ve gotta
have a way where um we deal in
that gray zone um and if you’re

00:42:10.428-->00:42:14.866
a static target, if you’re not
improving, evolving and moving
with technology, you’re gonna

00:42:14.866-->00:42:21.672
fall. So don’t be um you know
that victim that doesn’t doesn’t
move and gets to be a victim of

00:42:21.672-->00:42:26.677
technical debt. So for me,
asymmetric advantage is the
private sector and the

00:42:30.648-->00:42:36.554
government working together. Um
in that because what we found is
we used to have a lot of

00:42:36.554-->00:42:42.260
expertise on this stuff. Think
cryptography, the government had
that monopoly. Today we do not.

00:42:42.260-->00:42:47.465
A lot of the a lot of the
innovation, a lot of the brain
power is gonna be on the west

00:42:47.465-->00:42:51.335
coast. It’s gonna be in
industry, it’s gonna be in
private companies. Um and

00:42:51.335-->00:42:55.039
increasingly it’s gonna be
international too, right?
There’s not gonna be this huge

00:42:55.039-->00:43:00.311
dominance um in Silicon Valley.
We’re gonna see with the
investments going on um in Asia

00:43:00.311-->00:43:03.681
and elsewhere, we’re gonna see
other tries with really
important things that they can

00:43:03.681-->00:43:10.054
contribute. So a coordinated
approach, um, is important. So
um you know I’ll leave you with

00:43:10.054-->00:43:15.693
a thought here if um you know if
you like this challenge and it’s
gonna be a challenge for years

00:43:15.693-->00:43:20.698
and you want to be part of um
doing hacking for good, um, you
want to see using some of these

00:43:24.001-->00:43:29.040
skills to defend the country. Um
come to NSA, you can be part of
that. I can tell you, you can

00:43:29.040-->00:43:33.010
come back to DefCon and not
worry other three letter
agencies may be waiting here for

00:43:33.010-->00:43:38.049
you too. Right. So we can do
that hacking stuff in a legal
way. You gotta be clearable. So

00:43:38.049-->00:43:42.687
sorry I know there’s a heavy
foreign contingent in here. But
we’d be happy to talk to you. Go

00:43:42.687-->00:43:49.060
to the NSA website. So where is
cyber going? Um it really means
that we’ve got to innovate,

00:43:49.060-->00:43:54.832
we’ve got to be engaged every
single day. Um we’ve got to,
we’ve gotta counter the people

00:43:54.832-->00:43:59.871
that are engaging us at a level
below the threshold of war and
the people are gonna make the

00:43:59.871-->00:44:01.806
difference in that. So I’ve run
past my time, they’re about to
give me the hook um but I’ll

00:44:01.806-->00:44:03.808
wander. I think we’re gonna go
to the chill out room if
somebody’s got a specific

00:44:03.808-->00:44:08.813
question. Thank you for your
time and attention. [applause]
