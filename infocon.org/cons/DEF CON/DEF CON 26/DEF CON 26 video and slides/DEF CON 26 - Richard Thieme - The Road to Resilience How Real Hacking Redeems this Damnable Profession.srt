00:00:00.000-->00:00:06.607
>>So this is Richard Theime .
I’ll give him the Stage. >>Thank
you, thanks very much. Thanks

00:00:06.607-->00:00:13.380
[applause] Okay, thank you
[applause] Had to turn off the
phone because of course one of

00:00:13.380-->00:00:18.385
my friends always calls to tell
me how I look on stage from the
audience. [laughter] It’s in the

00:00:20.888-->00:00:25.692
middle of a very poignant moment
when Simple Nomad did that. He
said you’re doing great. Doing

00:00:25.692-->00:00:30.697
great. My mistake for answering.
Ah, [laughter] Okay ah,
technological problems always

00:00:33.567-->00:00:38.639
crop up and the one that cropped
up here is when we translated
the slides from PDF from, ah,

00:00:38.639-->00:00:43.644
Powerpoint then Keynote to PDF,
um, some of them look like that
and some look like that.

00:00:46.546-->00:00:51.451
[laughter] It can’t help but
remind me of ah that
mockumentary right, where the ah

00:00:51.451-->00:00:58.191
Stonehenge came down, Spinal Tap
instead of a full size
Stonehenge, they had a one foot

00:00:58.191-->00:01:03.397
Stonehenge and they had to dance
around without stepping on it.
Ah, so I am going to try to

00:01:03.397-->00:01:10.037
read, I will read the slides to
you when those come up. Ah, what
that one says is the title, “The

00:01:10.037-->00:01:16.143
Road to Resilience – Strategies
for Playing Through the Pain”.
It says this is DC 26 and it

00:01:16.143-->00:01:21.481
gives the date and the Road to
Resilience is kind of a follow
up of a talk I did two years ago

00:01:21.481-->00:01:25.986
called Playing Through the Pain.
That one was focused on the
impact of dark knowledge on

00:01:25.986-->00:01:31.525
security and intelligence
professionals. And maybe not
unsurprisingly over 50 people

00:01:31.525-->00:01:36.129
responded with stories they
wanted me to hear when I made
that request for that talk,

00:01:36.129-->00:01:40.200
people from the intelligence
community, from the security
world ah and from military and

00:01:40.200-->00:01:45.072
corporate. This time it goes a
step further because what we
wanted to focus on was

00:01:45.072-->00:01:49.776
resilience. In other words when
this stuff happens what do you
do to recapture yourself and

00:01:49.776-->00:01:54.748
relocate yourself in a universe
that makes sense? Because what
we are talking about now has a

00:01:54.748-->00:01:59.886
technical term that is becoming
more popular called moral harms;
popular in the sense the Army

00:01:59.886-->00:02:05.325
military studies are using it a
lot. It’s not the same as PTSD.
It simply means that you have a

00:02:05.325-->00:02:10.464
self and you have an ethic;
whatever it may be and you have
been constrained and put in to a

00:02:10.464-->00:02:16.570
position to do something or know
something or learn something or
see something which so assaults

00:02:16.570-->00:02:21.208
your sense of self that it
shatters. It’s like pulling the
cornerstone out of a foundation

00:02:21.208-->00:02:25.746
of the construction of reality
that you have built and in which
you thought you could live

00:02:25.746-->00:02:31.184
comfortably for the rest of your
life and suddenly it’s gone. So
we’re going to talk about some

00:02:31.184-->00:02:37.457
serious stuff, and, and try, I’m
going to try not to trivialize
it because as you will hear what

00:02:37.457-->00:02:44.064
the people have shared with me
who responded with their
narratives, uh, required arduous

00:02:44.064-->00:02:49.236
ah, what you might call, you
don’t hear the word soul work
often at Def Con but it required

00:02:49.236-->00:02:53.340
them to really wrestle with who
they were in order to
reconstruct themselves, scarred

00:02:53.340-->00:02:59.413
but ah, but resilient.
Resilience is the ability to
survive a threat or injury while

00:02:59.413-->00:03:04.885
engaging healthy coping
strategies that move you toward
health. You don’t ever arrive at

00:03:04.885-->00:03:09.890
full health but they move you
toward it. It’s a strategy to
restore a life worth living. So

00:03:13.593-->00:03:17.030
I want to be clear with some of
the examples I am going to give
you that I am not bashing the

00:03:17.030-->00:03:21.835
intelligence, intelligence
world. It’s easy to do that it’s
low hanging fruit that’s not

00:03:21.835-->00:03:26.907
what I am doing. The work needs
to be done; security work needs
to be done, uh, both domains

00:03:26.907-->00:03:33.814
they have many flaws and
dark-darknesses in them to which
we will have to refer but I am

00:03:33.814-->00:03:39.086
not doing it in order to saying
it’s all nonsense or make some
simplistic rejection of the need

00:03:39.086-->00:03:45.559
to defend ourselves in a world
ah often without honor. We need
all of that. And even if I

00:03:45.559-->00:03:50.397
thought we didn’t, the
multibillion dollar industries
you all have created have their

00:03:50.397-->00:03:56.336
own momentum and are not going
to go away even if the need for
security goes away ah which I

00:03:56.336-->00:04:03.210
can count on you to make sure it
will not. [laughter] Okay, so
you recognize the truth of that

00:04:03.210-->00:04:08.248
statement. The point of this
talk is that we can encounter
shocking challenges to our very

00:04:08.248-->00:04:13.587
sense of self in the face of
which we need to be resilient
and as I say relocate ourselves

00:04:13.587-->00:04:18.325
in a universe that makes some
sort of sense again when the
foundations of our construction

00:04:18.325-->00:04:24.798
reality has been rocked. What
does that feel like? Ah, a
reporter, a very, very good

00:04:24.798-->00:04:29.469
Pulitzer Prize reporter
contacted me after the first
talk which they watched on

00:04:29.469-->00:04:36.309
YouTube and I know why they did.
Ah, they wanted to be in touch,
literally, in touch with another

00:04:36.309-->00:04:41.381
human being who understood what
they had gone through. They
referred to a number of times

00:04:41.381-->00:04:48.088
when their sources at CIA have
shared things that so rocked
their sense of the real that in

00:04:48.088-->00:04:53.793
their words, a very good phrase
of course, they are journalists,
prize winning, ah I felt like I

00:04:53.793-->00:04:58.799
lived underwater for 6 weeks.
And what stood out was when they
said they tried to tell other

00:05:01.268-->00:05:06.540
human beings not what they had
been told, because we can’t do
that exactly but what it was

00:05:06.540-->00:05:11.545
like to have that existential
experience no one understood and
so I recognized that the reason

00:05:14.047-->00:05:18.785
I got that call was because we
need to reach out to people who
have a clue about what we are

00:05:18.785-->00:05:25.759
talking about when we have been
plunged down to our very depths,
really to the depths of the

00:05:25.759-->00:05:32.165
reality in which we live and we
need community. And community is
going to come up again and again

00:05:32.165-->00:05:36.102
because of all the different
things I am going to share with
you ah, community and

00:05:36.102-->00:05:41.808
relationship is what people
referred to again and again as
essential to restoring a sense

00:05:41.808-->00:05:46.279
of wholeness but it’s not just
any community. It’s often a
counter culture community

00:05:46.279-->00:05:51.284
working on an ethos that
supports your best self not just
any self. Now, ah, okay, that’s

00:05:57.023-->00:06:02.862
a quote from John Perry Barlow
maybe you can, can read that ah,
recently died he dreamed of what

00:06:02.862-->00:06:07.500
cyberspace could be and he said,
I declare the global social
space we are building to be

00:06:07.500-->00:06:12.072
naturally independent of the
tyrannies you seek to impose on
us. He is talking to “the man”.

00:06:12.072-->00:06:17.711
Right . “You have no moral right
to rule us [ah] nor do you
possess any methods of

00:06:17.711-->00:06:24.217
enforcement [read its funny
right] ah to have true reason to
fear. We have true reason to

00:06:24.217-->00:06:29.222
fear. Of course now a number of
years after cyberspace is is is
systemic and everywhere ah we

00:06:31.358-->00:06:35.929
know of course we have reasons
to fear the enforcement of their
rules ah because they are so

00:06:35.929-->00:06:42.903
potent and so often ah
destructive. Now, he was
speaking in a different world of

00:06:42.903-->00:06:49.142
hacking back then hacking,
looking back 23 years when there
were 300 of you out there ah

00:06:49.142-->00:06:54.481
when I said to the small
audience that included Mudge and
others like him, “you will be

00:06:54.481-->00:06:59.386
the thought leaders of the 21st
century.” To watch those guys
The L0ft Panel the other night

00:06:59.386-->00:07:05.258
20 years after they spoke to the
Senate and fulfill that prophesy
of mine that was a different

00:07:05.258-->00:07:10.030
world than the one in which we
live now. Back then no one could
afford a workstation and the

00:07:10.030-->00:07:14.567
only way you could get on was to
hack through a university
system. Storage and access were

00:07:14.567-->00:07:20.874
both expensive and hacking made
us smile. How did it feel when
scored? How did it feel when you

00:07:20.874-->00:07:25.278
broke through and went to the
next level? So awesome how the
dots connected I was going to

00:07:25.278-->00:07:31.284
hit a video now from War Games
ah and Matthew Broderick when
the computer said “Would you

00:07:31.284-->00:07:37.524
like to play a game?” gave this
wonderful rendition of a hacker
going ohhh, because he has

00:07:37.524-->00:07:42.395
gotten in. And you all know what
that feeling is like to break
through. They wouldn’t let me

00:07:42.395-->00:07:48.101
show that clip because they are
going to load this tape onto
YouTube and it would violate

00:07:48.101-->00:07:53.006
their terms of service even
though I downloaded the clip
from YouTube. [laughter] But.

00:07:53.006-->00:07:58.011
That’s true. [claps] So John
Perry Barlow love him, love this
fantastic fantasy he had that

00:08:03.550-->00:08:10.423
cyberspace somehow floated above
like Lando Calrissian's ah cloud
city above the rest of the real

00:08:10.423-->00:08:15.528
earth. It did not, it did not.
It was human. And so a lot of
hackers saw themselves as

00:08:15.528-->00:08:22.335
individual vigilantes like my
hero in my novel “Foam” ah Don
Coyote ah tilting with the

00:08:22.335-->00:08:29.309
windmills of the man and the
system. Ah and so we imagine
ourselves as you recognize ah

00:08:29.309-->00:08:35.081
Mr. Robot; the myth of the lone
hacker. The lone hacker who can
do it all himself. But from the

00:08:35.081-->00:08:40.887
beginning you could never do it
all by yourself. Def Con and all
hacker cons were meritocracies,

00:08:40.887-->00:08:46.092
where you came to learn and they
were based on relationships and
those with whom you got into

00:08:46.092-->00:08:50.497
relationship made all the
difference. When you look at the
l0ft guys for example and women

00:08:50.497-->00:08:56.669
who weren’t on stage but were
powerfully present ah as part of
the l0ft ah you, you realize

00:08:56.669-->00:09:02.175
that they carefully chose and
kind of intuitively screened one
another. And when you went

00:09:02.175-->00:09:06.579
online you didn’t say to
somebody; well some did if they
were stupid they said teach me

00:09:06.579-->00:09:10.683
how to hack and they were
ignored. But others stayed up
all night at the bookstore

00:09:10.683-->00:09:15.188
reading O’Reilly books and when
they went online and asked the
question, people knew they had

00:09:15.188-->00:09:20.760
done all the homework and had a
decent question to ask and they
were respectful. It’s just like

00:09:20.760-->00:09:25.765
uh um uh the mafia really.
Respect the don. You now, kiss
his ring. It’s appropriate. Ah,

00:09:28.568-->00:09:34.541
because they have earned that
respect. And so the meritocracy
of real hackerdom in that day

00:09:34.541-->00:09:39.579
was based on relationships and
it was based on community even
though in that community there

00:09:39.579-->00:09:44.551
were a lot of individuals some
of whom were pretty high up on
the spectrum like Mr. Robot who

00:09:44.551-->00:09:50.523
thought of themselves as
isolated and alone. Now, you
recognize that. That’s Einstein

00:09:50.523-->00:09:55.195
and we use the phrase speaking
of someone of genius, “He’s an
Einstein”. And we talk about

00:09:55.195-->00:10:01.734
Einstein as if the theories of
relativity general and special
just popped into his head all at

00:10:01.734-->00:10:06.739
once without any help. Ah, that
too is the myth of the lone
genius. In one of his notebooks

00:10:09.142-->00:10:15.615
when he was struggling and stuck
you see this word “Grossman”
with exclamation points. Why?

00:10:15.615-->00:10:21.988
Because this guy, Marcel
Grossman, whose name nobody
knows because all of the

00:10:21.988-->00:10:27.527
collaborators disappeared in the
dustbin of history had taught
him something very, very

00:10:27.527-->00:10:32.532
important that made him suddenly
see above all that space was
relational. That space was

00:10:35.535-->00:10:40.206
relational which Einstein hadn’t
been able to get. And
Einstein’s; work is riddled with

00:10:40.206-->00:10:45.211
numerous mistakes that he made
trying to discover what he
finally was able to put together

00:10:47.380-->00:10:53.586
with the help of all these
unsung heroes. This work is the
same. We need community and I am

00:10:53.586-->00:10:58.224
going to return to that theme
again and again. Ah that’s
something some of you may

00:10:58.224-->00:11:03.696
recognize. Um, what you, what
you are looking at there is a
from Loop Quantum Gravity and

00:11:03.696-->00:11:05.698
what you are looking at is
called a Spin Network thanks to
Roger Penrose who conceived it

00:11:05.698-->00:11:07.700
as a way to illuminate visually
in a graph the relationship of
cyber, ah not cyberspace, but of

00:11:07.700-->00:11:10.203
all space time. Ah, space time
is granular and what you are
looking at is a set of

00:11:10.203-->00:11:13.006
relationships and those numbers
along those lines designate
areas which have as their sole

00:11:13.006-->00:11:15.108
substance their relationship to
one another. So using that as a
metaphor ah, even at that level

00:11:15.108-->00:11:17.110
of quantum space time, space
time consisting of granularity
rather than infinite smoothness

00:11:17.110-->00:11:19.612
we find the relationship is key.
And that’s what this is all
about. Relationship. Now

00:11:19.612-->00:11:24.617
cyberspace changed, no that’s
not supposed to be there quite
yet. Let’s see what that is,

00:11:31.591-->00:11:36.596
okay that is. I wrote a little
piece many years ago, let’s see
if I can read it. 1998 ah, first

00:11:49.242-->00:11:54.247
the explorer I said then the
pioneers then the merchants.
That’s the way the west was

00:12:16.803-->00:12:21.641
conquered You know, in the
Episcopal Church I served once
upon a time they joked that that

00:12:21.641-->00:12:25.778
Episcopalians wouldn’t come
until they had really good
stagecoaches and class ways of

00:12:25.778-->00:12:30.783
traveling. That’s why the
Baptist’s and the Methodist’s
got there first. Um, ah, truth

00:12:33.419-->00:12:39.592
in that. Uh but first the darers
go out, the first people who
hacked were in uncharted

00:12:39.592-->00:12:44.330
territory and then the real
pioneers that settled cyberspace
came after them and then as you

00:12:44.330-->00:12:50.737
know it was taken over by all
the people for whom you work.
Ah, it’s just the way; it’s just

00:12:50.737-->00:12:55.441
the way it is. You have been
assimilated. Let’s face it, it
doesn’t take long. This is

00:12:55.441-->00:13:00.213
Margaret Mead, a famous
anthropologist. Ah, Margaret
Meade said and you can’t read

00:13:00.213-->00:13:06.252
that either. One must spend at
least a year after the first
week in a new culture to learn

00:13:06.252-->00:13:11.524
as much as you do in that first
week. Why did she say that?
Because the culture assimilates

00:13:11.524-->00:13:17.597
you so quickly by giving you
unconscious cues of how to
structure time and space and

00:13:17.597-->00:13:22.769
love and relationship and
everything that you become part
of it even in spite of yourself.

00:13:22.769-->00:13:27.473
It’s why Timothy Leary said you
never get the truth from the
company memo. And when I would

00:13:27.473-->00:13:32.412
do consulting, I would often
talk to the janitor or secretary
and say, what’s it like here?

00:13:32.412-->00:13:36.983
Because the higher up you go,
it’s like Invasion of the Body
Snatchers. They open their mouth

00:13:36.983-->00:13:42.155
but out comes this alien Whah,
whah whah sound that reflects
the Company line. You know that

00:13:42.155-->00:13:48.561
that’s so. Timothy Leary knew
that is was so, so he said it.
Ah, it’s just the way it is.

00:13:48.561-->00:13:53.566
You’re assimilated into a, the
Borg. There we are back to the
Borg. So we become part of

00:13:57.804-->00:14:04.177
something whether we want to or
not because that’s what it means
to be human beings. That word is

00:14:04.177-->00:14:09.182
supernormals. Can anybody read
that? That’s wonderful, you must
be under 30. [laughter] Ah, what

00:14:13.386-->00:14:19.425
is the supernormal? Well, one of
the things they have looked at.
The hackers if you look back on

00:14:19.425-->00:14:25.531
the histories; a lot of hard
core people have. Uh, they share
some characteristics. Ah, but it

00:14:25.531-->00:14:30.803
was also true of people who made
great accomplishments like, ah,
Churchill who was always chased

00:14:30.803-->00:14:36.375
he said by his black dog, which
was always deep, deep, deep
depression. Which he always

00:14:36.375-->00:14:41.380
responded to by, with
resilience, by rushing off into
a new creative endeavor. Uh, and

00:14:43.683-->00:14:50.289
a lot of, you do that and there
are some characteristics for
supernormals, uh, you exceed the

00:14:50.289-->00:14:56.028
average in intelligence and
accomplishment. Uh, that’s just
a fact. This is an exceptional

00:14:56.028-->00:15:00.967
assembly of human beings; at
least most of you. [laughter]
But you know who you are.

00:15:04.837-->00:15:09.809
Nevertheless you’re your
marriages will end in divorce,
my first marriage did; uh, many

00:15:09.809-->00:15:14.814
of you lost a parent before you
were 20. My father died when I
was 2. My mother when I was 20.

00:15:18.518-->00:15:24.490
Uh, and that’s one of the
reasons that I had to invent a
life. I have to invent a persona

00:15:24.490-->00:15:31.197
and create it out of whole cloth
by trying to choose with broken
field running the assemblages of

00:15:31.197-->00:15:36.202
people who would help support a
persona that I wanted to develop
and this group did. So, we share

00:15:40.807-->00:15:46.579
those things and we learn to
fight. Supernormals, when you
question them they always say,

00:15:46.579-->00:15:52.151
I’m a fighter; I am a survivor,
I determined, I’m a scrapper;
I’m tough, I’m strong, I never

00:15:52.151-->00:15:57.156
give up; I keep going. I always
so what has to be done. I’m
driven. I’m a striver I always

00:15:59.325-->00:16:04.730
find a way. I do what has to be
done. That could describe ah,
all of you in the way you pursue

00:16:04.730-->00:16:10.503
your work. And you know how to
fight. Because somewhere you
made a decision deep inside

00:16:10.503-->00:16:16.075
yourself that I am not going to
let this stuff that happens to
me destroy me and you responded

00:16:16.075-->00:16:21.080
by fighting. Or, with flight if
not fight. He went inside. Some
of us disassociation. I was told

00:16:24.784-->00:16:29.755
by a therapists once that’s a
very good tool you have
developed there Mr. Thieme Ah,

00:16:29.755-->00:16:34.760
as long as you remember how to
come back. Ah, it’s like a
shaman, a shaman goes crazy on

00:16:37.129-->00:16:41.467
behalf of the community he or
she serves. Ah, but you have to
learn how to come back. You

00:16:41.467-->00:16:48.040
can’t stay there ah, because
then it is called a psychotic
break. So you don’t want to do

00:16:48.040-->00:16:54.213
that. You learn to be invisible.
You learn to hide. You learn to
be inconspicuous. You learn to

00:16:54.213-->00:16:58.017
create a private world. You
learn to create your own
language your own code and your

00:16:58.017-->00:17:02.521
own community out of all of
that. And above all you develop
vigilance. Some of you have

00:17:02.521-->00:17:08.561
powers of second sight. You
become hyper aware of the
environment . You sense cues of

00:17:08.561-->00:17:15.401
impending trouble. You sense,
sniff out, in cyberworlds when
something is about to happen. I

00:17:15.401-->00:17:20.539
remember at the NOC at the
Pentagon ah it was a very
non-standard set of software

00:17:20.539-->00:17:25.611
that was running on all of this,
all the computers around us And
the head of it suddenly from

00:17:25.611-->00:17:29.649
across the room he suddenly
squinted and said just a minute
and he went over and he said

00:17:29.649-->00:17:36.589
“that’s not right”. He just knew
having finely tuned his own
brain to the software and vice

00:17:36.589-->00:17:42.728
versa when something was
anomalous and didn’t belong
there. And you know how to do

00:17:42.728-->00:17:49.435
that. Ah, you start to know; you
start to know what isn’t right
and you learn when to take

00:17:49.435-->00:17:54.440
cover. So you become super in
achievement. Um, Oprah is a good
example. You look at how Oprah

00:17:57.310-->00:18:02.248
grew up and what she created out
of it,. So you never shake the
feeling though of being alien.

00:18:04.550-->00:18:09.956
My novel is about an alien. He
came to earth to do improve
because we were the sexiest and

00:18:09.956-->00:18:16.295
the funniest species in the
galaxy. [laughter]. So he
studied the internet and cable

00:18:16.295-->00:18:21.300
TV to learn how to behave as a
human with predictable
consequences. [laughter]. Ah,

00:18:23.369-->00:18:30.276
loved writing it but my wife
read that book, bless her heart,
and she said OK. is that 10?

00:18:30.276-->00:18:35.281
Thank you. She said, uh, this is
no alien. I know this man.
[laughter] Ah, who’s knows how

00:18:39.885-->00:18:43.956
many times you are going to be
able to say from this platform
what you can so you want to say

00:18:43.956-->00:18:48.961
the truth. Um, that’s true. Ah,
I had to use my energy to try to
act like other people in an

00:18:52.231-->00:18:58.771
anti-hero or superhero way and a
lot of us do that to right
wrongs. We become defenders and

00:18:58.771-->00:19:03.709
protectors. A lot of us are
family heroes and when a friend
of mine tested, ah, a big group

00:19:06.078-->00:19:12.785
of computer technical people,
she found they all were ISFJ’s,
which is the pattern of a

00:19:12.785-->00:19:17.289
protector and defender. The
problem of course is everyone on
her security team was a

00:19:17.289-->00:19:22.028
protector and a guardian and
that’s why they were attracted
to this work but then they hit

00:19:22.028-->00:19:25.765
something which is going to be
the substance of this talk that
they couldn’t protect their

00:19:25.765-->00:19:31.837
guard or defend. And then what
happens? They found out how
inadequate they were to the task

00:19:31.837-->00:19:37.843
they had set for themselves how
small and how did they respond
to the crisis? They had to learn

00:19:37.843-->00:19:42.948
to respond in a way , again a
world that is not often heard at
Def Con but it really is going

00:19:42.948-->00:19:49.121
to matter in a spiritual way,
which simply means they had to
reach down into their own depths

00:19:49.121-->00:19:53.726
and take the darkness they found
there in and fashion it into a
weapon with which to beat back

00:19:53.726-->00:19:58.731
the beasts of reality. In other
words that requires humility.
Ah, we can’t do it all but the

00:20:02.001-->00:20:08.007
butterfly effect is real my
friend said. She made a decision
to choose to do what she could

00:20:08.007-->00:20:13.012
do and make a difference in that
way. It’s all we’ve got. And
later on I will talk about what

00:20:15.147-->00:20:20.152
helps supernormals ameliorate
the consequences that are more
negative of living our lives the

00:20:22.154-->00:20:28.828
way we do. So, here’s another
tinny word. This comes from
Langdon Winner. Langdon was a

00:20:28.828-->00:20:34.533
great philosopher of technology
in the 90’s and he was very
concerned about what we were

00:20:34.533-->00:20:39.538
building without examination in
terms of; did it create freedom
for people? Did it create

00:20:41.540-->00:20:46.545
dignity for people? Did it
really empower more people that
it didn’t? We are

00:20:46.545-->00:20:53.085
technologically somnambulists,
he said, wandering through an
extended dream. We don’t know

00:20:53.085-->00:20:58.224
where we are going but we’re
sure on our way. We get excited
about every new, it doesn’t have

00:20:58.224-->00:21:04.363
to be an iPhone or a discovery
or a new exploit. We get so
excited but we don’t keep the

00:21:04.363-->00:21:10.603
big picture ad in that we
resemble this guy. Ah, that’s
Ender Wiggin. You might

00:21:10.603-->00:21:17.209
recognize him from Ender’s Game.
He thought he was playing a game
and hackers often start out

00:21:17.209-->00:21:23.482
gaming and the internet is the
biggest game of all and playing
it is the biggest reward of all.

00:21:23.482-->00:21:29.054
So it’s kind of like being a
drone pilot. Ah, those are
great; we love playing with

00:21:29.054-->00:21:34.393
drones. The attempt to
assassinate Maduro in Venezuela
was a proof of concept [shriek],

00:21:34.393-->00:21:40.065
right? I’m sorry are you from
Venezuela? [laughter]. I checked
immediately to see if the sale

00:21:40.065-->00:21:45.070
of drones in Washington DC had
gone up but, ah, couldn’t get
the data. [laughter]. So, I

00:21:47.640-->00:21:53.112
don’t know. But drone pilots
have the same kind of problems
that I’ve been starting to talk

00:21:53.112-->00:21:58.817
about. They go into a bunker.
They are there 12 hours. They’re
at war. They kill people. They

00:21:58.817-->00:22:04.156
see people die. They see
innocent people die. They see
and experience terrible things.

00:22:04.156-->00:22:09.228
At 6 o’clock they go home and
have dinner with the family; go
to their child’s soccer game and

00:22:09.228-->00:22:14.233
they are having numerous
problems in response to the
crisis this is creating for

00:22:16.502-->00:22:21.507
them. Fancy computer models and
convoluted technical language
about war. Organizations like

00:22:26.245-->00:22:31.750
Google, Amazon, Facebook, Apple,
Microsoft; they’re fancy
technical language is an

00:22:31.750-->00:22:36.755
obfuscation and as what they
create is woven into the texture
of everyday life the devices,

00:22:39.024-->00:22:44.029
techniques and systems we adopt
shed their tool like qualities
and they become part of our very

00:22:46.065-->00:22:51.070
humanity. So one question you
might ask yourself is what kind
of a society do you really want?

00:22:54.039-->00:22:58.744
And what do the organizations
for which you actually work,
actually create in the world.

00:22:58.744-->00:23:03.682
Google, do no evil? Really?
[laughter] Facebook, we’ll clean
it up ourselves. Really? Apple,

00:23:10.789-->00:23:16.929
well, we will use child labor to
make billions. We’re the first
trillion dollar company in the

00:23:16.929-->00:23:22.635
history of the planet; oh no,
that was Amazon. Forgive me. I
wouldn’t want to insult either

00:23:22.635-->00:23:27.640
one of them by comparing them to
the other. The, the fact is,
yeah, it was Apple wasn’t it.

00:23:31.010-->00:23:37.983
Ah, the fact is once we become
assimilated into these
organizational structures, we

00:23:37.983-->00:23:42.988
cease to see what it is we might
be creating. I was asked to be
on an advisory panel for a

00:23:45.924-->00:23:51.096
university in Minneapolis where
I recently moved. As I was
talking to them about a talk I

00:23:51.096-->00:23:57.803
might give for the students and
ne said, “Don’t confuse them.
[laughter] Ah, they don’t care

00:23:57.803-->00:24:02.741
about the meaning of life. We’re
just trying to prepare them for
jobs.” And that kind of said it

00:24:05.344-->00:24:10.349
all. So when we go back to
Barlow saying “Do you want to
play a game” like War Games? Ah,

00:24:15.988-->00:24:21.760
we have to face the fact that
world doesn’t exist anymore. But
this one does. James Baldwin

00:24:21.760-->00:24:26.765
said, “The price that we pay for
pursuing any profession or
calling is an intimate knowledge

00:24:30.469-->00:24:35.774
of its darkside.” And of course
you know Nietzsche’s observation
“Whoever battles monsters should

00:24:35.774-->00:24:41.180
take care not to become a
monster too. For if you stare
long enough into the Abyss, the

00:24:41.180-->00:24:47.619
Abyss stares back into you.” And
that sets up our discussion of
Moral Injury. Moral injury

00:24:47.619-->00:24:53.826
occurs when you betray what’s
right; what you know innately is
right in a high stakes

00:24:53.826-->00:25:00.165
situation. If you act contrary
to your own moral code or do
nothing or say nothing while

00:25:00.165-->00:25:06.705
others are so acting. Or realize
that your actions led to
unacceptable consequences like

00:25:06.705-->00:25:12.144
what we call euphemistically
collateral damage. The
principles that gave purpose

00:25:12.144-->00:25:17.182
meaning and direction to our
lives are violated and then we
feel a strange and alienated

00:25:17.182-->00:25:23.589
from ourselves and lives. The
external world loses its value
and seems pointless. Thousands

00:25:23.589-->00:25:29.895
are coming back from Afghanistan
and Iraq reporting this
experience. We become strangers

00:25:29.895-->00:25:34.900
in an alien environment. We need
to be relocated in the world and
somehow reconciled to ourselves.

00:25:38.036-->00:25:44.209
One said, my perception of good
and evil just slipped away. I
lost a world that made moral

00:25:44.209-->00:25:49.214
sense. So what do you think?
Does an employer have a
responsibility for recognizing

00:25:51.483-->00:25:57.489
the likelihood of moral injury
to his or her employees and
doing something proactive about

00:25:57.489-->00:26:03.061
it. Is this something your
company should be addressing and
thinking about because it

00:26:03.061-->00:26:09.468
matters? Do they recognize that
individuals may have the self,
separate from the persona they

00:26:09.468-->00:26:14.473
are asked to play as a cog in
their own machine. Well, let’s
take a look. They do formulate

00:26:18.610-->00:26:24.283
ethics. This comes from William
Webster, former CIA director. He
said in the United States we

00:26:24.283-->00:26:31.023
obey the laws the United States.
Abroad we uphold the security
interests of the United States.

00:26:31.023-->00:26:35.561
Ah, a euphemism for saying in
the United States we obey the
law, everywhere else we don’t.

00:26:35.561-->00:26:42.501
And them after 9/11, except here
too. [laughter] Um, and that’s
not a joke. That’s one of the

00:26:42.501-->00:26:47.506
challenges people face. Ah, this
is a um, URL for a document and
ethics code for US intelligence

00:26:51.143-->00:26:57.182
officers that was intended to
counter what happened after
9/11. Ah, I was a co-leader of

00:26:57.182-->00:27:02.721
the group that developed it over
several years and then it was
filtered, kind of secreted into

00:27:02.721-->00:27:07.726
the agency, as a standard others
might consult. The document is
written by Clint Brooks, ah, and

00:27:10.429-->00:27:15.434
Brian Snow. Ah, it lasted for a
while as a document that had no
teeth and then a new director

00:27:18.337-->00:27:24.877
came in and it disappeared. Ah,
it was intending to find a way
to say, how do we take into

00:27:24.877-->00:27:30.782
account the well being of the
citizens of the United States of
American themselves when we

00:27:30.782-->00:27:32.851
implement these new instructions
and it wasn’t just Bush; Obama
was more Bush than Bush. It was

00:27:32.851-->00:27:37.055
a direction in which everything
was going. So, it’s not the same
for everybody. There’s a sliding

00:27:37.055-->00:27:42.060
scale of moral harm Some are
really, really, serious and
others are just what you

00:27:49.101-->00:27:54.106
encounter everyday in your
ordinary lives. But let’s take a
look at what some people report

00:27:56.575-->00:28:01.513
they have encountered. Ah, this
is one who said ah, well, um, I
was asked to do something for

00:28:04.583-->00:28:09.388
one of the agencies and I said,
we don’t do that when they
described it. And then the

00:28:09.388-->00:28:14.393
agency representatives said,
“it’s really good money” and he
said, well how much? He told him

00:28:18.030-->00:28:23.035
and he said we could do that.
Yeah, I think we could do that.
And I asked him how he felt

00:28:25.637-->00:28:30.842
dealing with that reality
afterward. Ah, we’ll get to that
in a minute. And he said

00:28:30.842-->00:28:36.949
[laughter] uh, he said well it’s
kind of like Woody Allen writing
a movie about how when you’ve

00:28:36.949-->00:28:43.055
killed your mistress, you can
learn to love with it. He said,
well you just, let’s move on OK,

00:28:43.055-->00:28:48.060
that happened. So if you can do
that, this is not going to
become, about 5:30, OK, ah, this

00:28:50.529-->00:28:56.568
is not going to become that kind
of thing. Ah, another person who
worked for the NSA said my time

00:28:56.568-->00:29:01.873
wasn’t traumatic I only became
paranoid later when I realized
that people inside were keeping

00:29:01.873-->00:29:07.446
track of me. I was approached
and asked to work informally as
a source by people who knew

00:29:07.446-->00:29:13.051
everything about my past and
present work. In one case, a
colleague I had know for years

00:29:13.051-->00:29:18.290
but never realized he has cover
IC ties. There’s a grey zone of
people like us that are neither

00:29:18.290-->00:29:23.295
in nor out of the IC. And I’m
kind of like, like one of those.
Luckily he said I’m not

00:29:26.598-->00:29:33.472
important so they leave me
alone. But when I see a white
unmarked van parked on my street

00:29:33.472-->00:29:40.412
I start to wonder. So one of the
least lethal consequences is you
become hypervigilant, paranoid

00:29:40.412-->00:29:46.318
and suspicious and it interferes
with your ability to screen
reality successfully as well as

00:29:46.318-->00:29:48.320
your relationships. Another city
does non-classified
cybersecurity work for the

00:29:48.320-->00:29:50.322
government. Ah, a branch of ah,
the DOD; service branch ah,
can’t give the name, was hosting

00:29:50.322-->00:29:52.324
an event for industry and other
federal entities to discuss
non-classified cybersecurity

00:29:52.324-->00:29:57.329
challenges. Ah, he was part of a
team of 5 and they were told we
will not allow naturalized

00:30:11.910-->00:30:16.915
citizens of the United States to
attend this meeting. Are you all
natural born American citizens?

00:30:20.052-->00:30:25.490
He said that really threw them
because they all could have said
yes we were all born here but

00:30:25.490-->00:30:30.395
they chose instead to say we
will not attend under those
strictures. Ah, we ask you to

00:30:30.395-->00:30:35.534
waive that condition for the
meeting. And the answer was,
then you aren’t going to attend.

00:30:35.534-->00:30:40.472
And we are not going to waive
that condition for the meeting
and what it left them with in

00:30:40.472-->00:30:45.777
this current climate that you
all know ah, is that more
widespread? Was there a

00:30:45.777-->00:30:51.783
presidential directive, PDD, was
there an executive order? To say
that naturalized American

00:30:51.783-->00:30:57.055
citizens should be treated as
second class citizens and even
when non-classified, non-secret

00:30:57.055-->00:31:01.426
material is being discussed
should not be allowed to attend
any meetings that apply to

00:31:01.426-->00:31:06.431
security because we can’t trust
anyone who came here from
somewhere else. Ah, when you ask

00:31:09.134-->00:31:14.139
people like that what their game
plan is they tell you the
country they will move to. Ah,

00:31:16.274-->00:31:21.580
more and more, people are
telling me what, they ask, what
country have you picked? Well we

00:31:21.580-->00:31:28.220
live in Minneapolis it’s a
straight shot to the Canadian
border and according to ah, a

00:31:28.220-->00:31:32.357
program the other day on
television ah there are many
places on the Canadian border

00:31:32.357-->00:31:37.362
where we can get across
unobserved. Uh, so he said all
businesses have a disaster plan,

00:31:42.334-->00:31:48.140
don’t we need to have one too in
case the disaster we fear
actually comes to pass in this

00:31:48.140-->00:31:53.145
country. In other words, they
became hypervigilant,
hyperaware, frightened paranoid

00:31:55.781-->00:32:01.319
He said it’s a question of
anticipating that everything we
do is dual use and it reminded

00:32:01.319-->00:32:05.891
me of someone whose worked at
CIA for a while saying to me,
what if you discover that you

00:32:05.891-->00:32:10.896
have sold your soul but you
didn’t realize it until after
you’d signed the transaction.

00:32:13.198-->00:32:17.936
Well this other guy can get
another job but a single mother
raising children might not and

00:32:17.936-->00:32:23.308
she might have to sign a
document saying she won’t attend
a meeting with anyone who wasn’t

00:32:23.308-->00:32:28.313
born here. That’s how it
happens. Creep by creep. People
from another country once asked

00:32:31.950-->00:32:36.288
me to help consult with them
because they were offered a
contract that was significant

00:32:36.288-->00:32:40.926
for a part of our security,
military industry. And some of
the people objected to the

00:32:40.926-->00:32:45.931
things we were doing. And the
question posed was can we in
good conscience do that work?

00:32:48.667-->00:32:54.539
And my answer was you made that
decision when you went into the
information security business.

00:32:54.539-->00:32:59.110
Because you never know who you
are working for. And you
certainly don’t know what secret

00:32:59.110-->00:33:04.716
contracts they’ve had with what
government organizations. It’s
not a conspiracy theory it’s a

00:33:04.716-->00:33:09.721
fact that I know from
experience; that early on all
the big players were consulting

00:33:12.524-->00:33:17.529
and agreeing to consult with all
of the relevant government
entities in order to build what

00:33:19.598-->00:33:25.670
they mutually agreed, not as a
conspiracy but with all good
intentions was the right thing

00:33:25.670-->00:33:32.177
to build. So once you’ve entered
the industry you might have some
white flag operation. Is it

00:33:32.177-->00:33:37.949
really Israel that wants you or
is it somebody else? Is it
really Serbia that wants you or

00:33:37.949-->00:33:44.756
is it somebody else? Well this
kind of stuff can add up. Ah,
somebody told me they didn’t

00:33:44.756-->00:33:50.028
realize the pressures put on
them. They were coming home
through Dubai after some work

00:33:50.028-->00:33:55.901
abroad, went out alone for
dinner and collapsed. Just
collapsed. He said I almost

00:33:55.901-->00:34:00.839
didn’t get back to the hotel. I
had not recognized what was
happening to me. A CIA woman

00:34:03.842-->00:34:10.548
told me her therapist told her
it was fighter pilot syndrome.
10 minutes? Or you have all 10

00:34:10.548-->00:34:17.322
fingers and….Okay [laughter] Ah,
fighter pilot syndrome. You do
it when you’re there

00:34:17.322-->00:34:22.327
hypervigilant and present but
when the emergency is over your
brain goes haywire. Well, he

00:34:24.729-->00:34:29.134
said 10 minutes so I’m going to
have to skip a couple of these
testimonies. I always have more

00:34:29.134-->00:34:34.139
material but I want to get to ah
some of the ones that ah spoke
most loudly to me. Ah, I

00:34:37.208-->00:34:42.547
included Equifax only because
when the Equifax debacle took
place, this was just to point

00:34:42.547-->00:34:46.885
out there are other kinds of
stress that are put on
information security people. Ah,

00:34:46.885-->00:34:51.890
Susan Mauldin was vilified for
having a degree in music. Ah,
Mudge, who was on the stage as a

00:34:53.925-->00:34:58.930
hero the other night, has a
degree in music. But he is never
vilified for it or told he has

00:35:01.733-->00:35:05.537
no business being in the
industry because he wasn’t
prepared properly. And I have a

00:35:05.537-->00:35:10.909
whole list of people I won’t
read ah who did not have those
credentials. But if you have the

00:35:10.909-->00:35:15.647
right looks; I mean just look at
the difference right? Is there a
difference why this arch

00:35:15.647-->00:35:20.652
criminal at Theranos was
accepted for so long committing
amazing fraud that risked the

00:35:22.787-->00:35:29.194
lives of many people in the
blood test ah they said they
could process were fraudulent.

00:35:29.194-->00:35:36.067
I’m not going to go there but I
think, I think there’s a reason
this one got a pass. But you

00:35:36.067-->00:35:41.072
know about that. Okay, what
you’re looking at is a coca
field. Ah, coca as I am sure 80

00:35:44.542-->00:35:49.547
percent of you know makes
cocaine and ah [laughter] it has
to be processed and when I

00:35:52.217-->00:35:58.089
requested help, one of my
friends ah said you can use this
story because it was so

00:35:58.089-->00:36:03.094
monumental for him. He was a
scientist at CIA and he
developed a very effective way

00:36:03.094-->00:36:09.467
of using crop dusters to spray
the coca crop and destroy it.
And he went to Peru to test it.

00:36:09.467-->00:36:15.040
He put together materials from
ah, very ingenious right,
they’re smart. Leaf cutter ants

00:36:15.040-->00:36:20.879
provided a fungus; a species of
butterfly provided a toxin and
so on and it worked beautifully.

00:36:20.879-->00:36:26.384
It just wiped out the coca crop.
He went there undercover; tested
it, came back and said we’re,

00:36:26.384-->00:36:32.257
we’re ready to go. Ah, the
executive branch had to sign off
on it and they said no I don’t

00:36:32.257-->00:36:39.230
want you to do this. Um, he said
why. He said because ah people
will think it’s, it’s a

00:36:39.230-->00:36:43.068
biological warfare. We don’t do
that. And he showed them why it
wasn’t. Oh, we’ll reconsider and

00:36:43.068-->00:36:45.070
they came back and they said it
will destroy all of the orange
groves. And he said, no we

00:36:45.070-->00:36:47.072
tested it, it doesn’t destroy
anything but the coca. And they
said, oh, we’ll reconsider it.

00:36:47.072-->00:36:52.077
They came back and they said
what about the cocaleros? They
make their whole living from

00:36:57.782-->00:37:02.620
coca and he said 20 million
dollar check written from the
Treasury will take care of it.

00:37:02.620-->00:37:08.026
And they are set for life, they
take our money and not grow
coca. They are good with it.

00:37:08.026-->00:37:11.463
Let’s go ahead with it and they
said we’ll think about it and
they came back a final time.

00:37:11.463-->00:37:16.534
Each time the person responding
to him escalated closer and
closer to Cabinet level and one

00:37:16.534-->00:37:23.408
came back and said just forget
it. This program is dead. It’s
not going to happen. And he

00:37:23.408-->00:37:30.348
said, Why? And they said you
don’t understand what we are
saying to you, do you? And he

00:37:30.348-->00:37:35.487
said, I just want to know why
and he said because way too many
people in the Executive Branch

00:37:35.487-->00:37:41.926
make way too much money from
cocaine. And they are not going
to allow this stream of income

00:37:41.926-->00:37:46.931
to be disrupted. That offended
his moral sense and his sense of
who he was after all those years

00:37:49.901-->00:37:55.140
in the Agency doing work on
behalf of the good guys. And he
said, well let’s out them; let’s

00:37:55.140-->00:38:01.946
be whistleblowers then. We could
expose them. And the answer he
got back and I quote, “Stop it

00:38:01.946-->00:38:06.951
now! Or you will become dead.”
He left the agency that year.
Um, it took him ten years to

00:38:14.159-->00:38:20.365
reconstitute himself in the face
of first of all guilt and shame
and not blowing the whistle even

00:38:20.365-->00:38:25.370
though there was a viable death
threat made to him. But above
all how his grandiose ego shrank

00:38:28.072-->00:38:32.911
to bean size when he realized
that up against the real
systemic endemic evil of the

00:38:32.911-->00:38:37.682
world he was powerless. We talk
about blowing the whistle. I
have a whole section on that

00:38:37.682-->00:38:41.886
that will be in another talk
when I do this again. Whistle
blowing is not for the faint of

00:38:41.886-->00:38:47.525
heart. And none of us know what
we will really do when the chips
are down and threats are made.

00:38:47.525-->00:38:54.399
Some get away with it. Ellsberg
did a masterful job. Some others
haven’t. And a number have told

00:38:54.399-->00:38:59.404
me they would never do it again.
Well what did this guy do?
Facing anger and fear because he

00:39:01.639-->00:39:06.177
had been threatened and
powerlessness and he didn’t have
the guts to do anything about it

00:39:06.177-->00:39:11.883
or the courage to do anything or
really the power to do anything.
He removed himself from that

00:39:11.883-->00:39:18.656
arena. He focused on actually
his daily life and what I call
spirituality. Unforgiveness, he

00:39:18.656-->00:39:24.829
did an intensive 4 year program
for spiritual grounding and in
10 years he came to focus on the

00:39:24.829-->00:39:31.069
necessity for discernment in
order to do that. I ran this
past a friend of mine at CIA.

00:39:31.069-->00:39:37.909
Ah, so I checked out all the
details that I was given to make
sure they added up and he said,

00:39:37.909-->00:39:42.747
oh yeah, a lot of people who
leave CIA have stories like
that. They come back from a job

00:39:42.747-->00:39:47.752
or a mission and they do that.
Ah, or they say, I need to go
get another ladle of patriotism.

00:39:50.788-->00:39:55.793
Ah, and and bone up again on on
I’m a good guy doing good guy
stuff. This is corroborated by

00:39:59.864-->00:40:04.869
an Army Ranger who came to me
at, in this uh, this conference
a while ago and he said I was

00:40:08.506-->00:40:14.679
sent to Haiti as part of a
Special Operation ah with a
team. Ah, Haiti was in chaos and

00:40:14.679-->00:40:20.919
this was going to affect the
cocaine trafficking through that
island at that time and they

00:40:20.919-->00:40:27.558
understood their mission was to
go down there to um stop the
cocaine. But when we got there

00:40:27.558-->00:40:32.530
we found that our mission was to
keep those channels of cocaine
flowing. They didn’t want the

00:40:32.530-->00:40:36.734
chaos to interfere with the flow
of the cocaine. Where was it
going? Well if you have seen the

00:40:36.734-->00:40:42.373
movie “American Made” about
Barry Seale; that’s the real
Barry Seale, that’s Tom Cruise

00:40:42.373-->00:40:48.846
[laughter] playing Barry Seale.
You know, you do eat over your
emotions when you are a cocaine

00:40:48.846-->00:40:55.386
runner sometimes? So ah,
[laughter] that’s a statement
about how Haiti was used to make

00:40:55.386-->00:41:00.091
sure you knew he was telling the
truth and that’s where it was
going, Mena, Arkansas. Mena,

00:41:00.091-->00:41:04.629
Arkansas, airport through which.
See “American Made” . It’s
fictionalized but it’s a truish

00:41:04.629-->00:41:10.868
story. Ah, Mena was awash in
cocaine. That was Arkansas. I
don’t know if Arkansas rings any

00:41:10.868-->00:41:16.207
bells for the rest of you. I can
just tell you that he pardoned
his brother and Lassiter and all

00:41:16.207-->00:41:21.212
of those distributing cocaine at
a major level. Ah, the use of
the pardon to over, ah, overtake

00:41:23.448-->00:41:28.453
criminality and excuse it is not
new. It’s not happening here. Or
how about this one, quickly.

00:41:31.622-->00:41:36.094
When one joins an intelligence
service, one is involved in low
level apprentice tasks.

00:41:36.094-->00:41:40.598
Assignments removed from
profound moral considerations.
In the course of a career such

00:41:40.598-->00:41:46.337
actions grow into being. Almost
imperceptibly you wake to where
you are and realize you have not

00:41:46.337-->00:41:50.541
been prepared for this. And you
are so deeply into it; well
beyond a place where you might

00:41:50.541-->00:41:54.979
have stepped back if it had been
presented from the start but it
is always, if this is the case

00:41:54.979-->00:42:01.352
to late to do anything about it.
Ok, this talk is about some
anecdotes. Let me quickly read

00:42:01.352-->00:42:06.858
to you what Steve Miles said.
Steve wrote the book, “Oath
Betrayed” and he’s writing a

00:42:06.858-->00:42:11.796
book now called “The Torture
Doctors”. He’s dealt with this
stuff. Ah, he said when I go to

00:42:11.796-->00:42:16.401
disaster areas I decompress on
the way out in a non-affected
part of the country. After

00:42:16.401-->00:42:22.273
horrendous times I was restored
in everyday rhythms of life in a
coffee shop; a beer at sunset

00:42:22.273-->00:42:26.744
for a couple of days. Local
detox helped me see the
loveliness of the people and

00:42:26.744-->00:42:32.316
place. A week in a small town
with a decent market after 6
weeks of parades of dump trucks

00:42:32.316-->00:42:38.222
loaded with bodies in Indonesia
after a tsunami was a test of my
strategy. I developed it over

00:42:38.222-->00:42:43.961
the years. It sure beats
breaking down an upscale grocery
market stateside because I got

00:42:43.961-->00:42:49.033
the cultural bends from
ascending too fast from my first
experience in a guerrilla war

00:42:49.033-->00:42:54.038
zone. What heals supernormals?
Sorry, I always, Ithought I had
this. How many? 2 minutes. Ah,

00:42:58.609-->00:43:03.548
right. [laughter]. Ok, I thought
I had this all planned out. Ah,
what helps family? Family, if

00:43:06.517-->00:43:12.957
they are sane. Ah, that’s not
always true but you know, choose
your family carefully. Ah

00:43:12.957-->00:43:19.096
[laughter} friends helps,
community helps. All 12 step
communities seem to help because

00:43:19.096-->00:43:24.669
they give you a place to tell
the truth about your real self.
Ah, one at one time in my life,

00:43:24.669-->00:43:30.274
it saved my life. They give you
feedback and you provide
mutuality of people who are

00:43:30.274-->00:43:35.213
non-judgmental because they are
just like you. So you are not
going to get judged by them. And

00:43:35.213-->00:43:40.318
they give you a place, above
all, accountability. Uh, some
kind of spirituality that

00:43:40.318-->00:43:47.125
enables you to manage your ego.
Um, that helps. So what are we
saying this is? I’ve never heard

00:43:47.125-->00:43:52.129
this word said in 23 years at
Def Con. The word really is
Respond to the crisis with Love.

00:43:55.132-->00:44:00.071
Now where did this slide come
from [applause]? Thank you.
These are 3 slides “Respond with

00:44:04.442-->00:44:09.981
Love”; “Not What You See, How
You See”; and “Be Love, Not Feel
Love”, and that came from a

00:44:09.981-->00:44:16.787
Deputy Director at NSA who told
me, “It is love but we are so
conditioned in my environment

00:44:16.787-->00:44:21.792
and culture that one would not
even think about saying that out
loud. “ Ah, I don’t know what

00:44:24.595-->00:44:30.768
else works. I’m 74 years old.
I’m not the smartest person in
the world but I’ve tried a lot

00:44:30.768-->00:44:37.074
of things that I thought would
work and they don’t often work.
Um, that works! Find a way to

00:44:37.074-->00:44:42.079
get ahold of the darkness within
yourself that you have seen when
you face the abyss but above all

00:44:44.181-->00:44:49.954
as that NSA friend said
described a long program that he
was apart of and he said I’d

00:44:49.954-->00:44:54.592
found 2 other people. We were
all cleared for the program. And
we stayed up late at night

00:44:54.592-->00:44:59.864
because he was losing sleep over
the ethical issues of how to
defend this country and protect

00:44:59.864-->00:45:04.535
its people from undue
surveillance at the same time
and they found a way to strike a

00:45:04.535-->00:45:09.874
balance that made sense to them.
It was his opinion that if
Snowden had had 3 people like

00:45:09.874-->00:45:15.246
that to struggle with far into
the night; one of them might
have said, “Think through what

00:45:15.246-->00:45:20.251
you are doing”. Because he
didn’t think Snowden was a hero.
A community even 2 or 3 trusted

00:45:22.687-->00:45:27.191
friends if you get into those
agencies. If you get into
Google. If you get into

00:45:27.191-->00:45:33.664
Microsoft. If you get into all
of the little brothers or the
big brothers. You need a counter

00:45:33.664-->00:45:40.404
community to help you find your
way when the light is very, very
faint. It doesn’t mean you won’t

00:45:40.404-->00:45:46.177
be without scars at the end of
the road. But the scars will
merely be signs that you have

00:45:46.177-->00:45:51.182
lived a genuinely human life.
Ok, we’re done? We’re done,
thank you. [applause]
