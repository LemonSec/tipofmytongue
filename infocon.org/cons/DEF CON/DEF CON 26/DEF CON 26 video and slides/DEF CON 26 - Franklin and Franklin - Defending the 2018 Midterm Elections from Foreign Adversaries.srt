00:00:00.000-->00:00:05.405
>>Hi everyone um, democracy is a
little rough in the in the
morning here. Ooof, that was a

00:00:05.405-->00:00:10.410
shot, okay um. >>Freedom burns.
[Audience and speakers laugh]
>>I love it. Ya, so you know I’m

00:00:13.180-->00:00:18.418
Josh Franklin. >>And I’m Kevin
Franklin. >>You know and we are
going to talk about some of the,

00:00:18.418-->00:00:23.423
like a, like online election
hijinks that we have been seeing
since 2012 and then basically

00:00:26.159-->00:00:32.966
talk about our efforts to
protect the 2018 midterm
elections. We’ll ah basically be

00:00:32.966-->00:00:37.971
seeing some ah some typo
squatting on like ah large
we-well known political figures,

00:00:40.440-->00:00:45.445
political parties, also take a
look at malware inside of ah
campaigns um and stat- ah state

00:00:51.752-->00:00:56.757
election websites. >>So this is
a really important disclaimer.
Um, this this work really does

00:00:59.159-->00:01:04.064
not represent the opinions of
our employers, ah this is
personal work. We do this on

00:01:04.064-->00:01:08.936
personal time. Ah I’m working
out of the basement, he’s
working out of the basement. Ah

00:01:08.936-->00:01:13.941
it is intended to be party
agnostic despite my goon like
colors. >>And my blue one.

00:01:17.010-->00:01:22.015
[Audience laughs] Ya so. So not
a goon. >>Ya so this, you know
this is your typical voting

00:01:24.318-->00:01:31.058
machine. Ah, it is something
that folks have been you know
spending ah a lot of really good

00:01:31.058-->00:01:36.063
time looking at in ah
investigating since the year
2000, 2002. We are not talking

00:01:38.098-->00:01:43.103
about these. Ah we are you know
going to be talking about stuff
that has been ah attacked. We

00:01:45.672-->00:01:50.677
are going to be taking a look at
all the things su- surrounding
ah like these systems to make

00:01:53.380-->00:01:57.751
these things function. >>Here is
the agenda that we will cover
today. Ah we are going to talk

00:01:57.751-->00:02:02.889
about the history of our
project. Ah it has been a labor
of love for us. Ah we will talk

00:02:02.889-->00:02:07.995
about the methodology of of how
we do what we do. We’re gonna to
spend some time trying to

00:02:07.995-->00:02:13.033
educate you and ah and inform
about the elections
infrastructure. We’ll look at

00:02:13.033-->00:02:17.604
some results of some campaign
analysis that we’ve done. Ah
we’ll look at some state

00:02:17.604-->00:02:22.609
results. We’ll look at results
of standing vendors. Um we’ll
have some recommendations and

00:02:24.945-->00:02:29.950
we’ll have some con-conclusions
at the very end. Ah so on this
slide, I got to hold the sword.

00:02:32.619-->00:02:39.459
>>Not fair. >>It was a big deal
for me so. Um I wanted to have a
white hat, a white top hat but

00:02:39.459-->00:02:44.464
ah ah so I’m Kevin Franklin.
>>Ya and I’m Josh Franklin. Ah,
and ah, so I’ve have been in the

00:02:47.067-->00:02:53.340
game since 04. Ah, since I
started in college. Ah I’ve been
working with you know election

00:02:53.340-->00:02:59.279
systems in some form or fashion
ever since. I helped set up in
you know, run and repair ah

00:02:59.279-->00:03:05.752
voting machines in the state of
Georgia for about 6 years, 5
years um while I was in college

00:03:05.752-->00:03:12.392
ah. Then I moved to the U.S.
election assistance commission
where I ah, ah basically did

00:03:12.392-->00:03:17.664
testing and certification of
voting systems. Ah and then I
moved ah to the National

00:03:17.664-->00:03:21.268
Institute of Standards and
Technology where I’ve been
basically leading some of the

00:03:21.268-->00:03:25.772
cyber security aspects of the
voting project there. I have
recently worked there and I’m

00:03:25.772-->00:03:31.611
not speaking for any of those
folks. [speaker laughs] >>And,
and my background is IT. I have

00:03:31.611-->00:03:38.285
been in IT for about 30 years.
Um, my my history really is in
performance and optimization of

00:03:38.285-->00:03:44.524
code. Transactions per a second,
think of it that way. Um early
on I did some work with ah with

00:03:44.524-->00:03:49.529
Lockheed and with NASA. Uh, I’ve
been in big data for about the
last 20 years and I work for a

00:03:51.565-->00:03:56.570
financial institution. >>Word.
Word. Ya this one’s, this one’s
yours man. >>So what is

00:04:00.307-->00:04:06.780
ElectionBuster? Ah, getting
getting terminology right is ah
is ah often a very difficult

00:04:06.780-->00:04:12.352
thing. We tend to over use the
word Electionbuster. Ah it is a
python application that we’ve

00:04:12.352-->00:04:16.623
written. We call that
Electionbuster. It is also a
software suite that we’ve

00:04:16.623-->00:04:21.528
written that is called
Electionbuster. It is also the
project itself. Um but

00:04:21.528-->00:04:27.434
everything that we do is ah is
all about protecting the U.S.
election ah ecosystem. Um the

00:04:27.434-->00:04:33.707
scope, this scope is very large.
Ah, there there are lots of
candidates, ah there there tons

00:04:33.707-->00:04:38.678
of election officials. Many
different voting system
manufactures, service providers,

00:04:38.678-->00:04:45.652
um the initial thrust of of this
effort started with trying to
find fake presidential sites.

00:04:45.652-->00:04:51.424
And currently we are assessing
different campaign
infrastructure and the online

00:04:51.424-->00:04:56.429
state and local infrastructure.
And we are identifying fake
sites for candidates, packs and

00:04:58.732-->00:05:03.670
states. >>Ya, so this all
started in 2012 as ah, as ah
George Mason project. Um, go

00:05:06.973-->00:05:11.578
patriot hackers. Um you this was
just something that I needed a
semester project for and I

00:05:11.578-->00:05:16.082
thought it would be interesting
to take a look at ah you know
who was basically typosquatting

00:05:16.082-->00:05:21.087
on McRomney and o you know ah
and Obama. Uh we were basically
just hunt and peck typing,

00:05:23.123-->00:05:29.496
trying to find various ah you
know fake sites. Ah shout out to
you know Robert and Matt who

00:05:29.496-->00:05:36.436
basically ah where you know ah
really in on the on the ground
floor a-a-and we actually

00:05:36.436-->00:05:41.441
presented our initial results at
Shmoocon in fort- ah 2014. Ah,
after that, we released the

00:05:44.511-->00:05:49.516
first version of our code. Um at
besides D.C. in 2015. Ah since
then we have been basically

00:05:54.454-->00:06:00.126
collecting huge amounts of data.
Ah looking at all the
infrastructure that we can find.

00:06:00.126-->00:06:06.766
Ah and we were really focusing
on having a, you know,
measurable impact for 2018. And

00:06:06.766-->00:06:11.771
I ah you’ll see that we
basically got there. >>Alright,
this is this is how we do ah our

00:06:16.343-->00:06:21.748
Electionbuster work. This is ah
this is the way we do it. Let’s
say we’re we’re interested in a

00:06:21.748-->00:06:26.753
specific ah office and analyzing
that. Ah we’ll obtain a list of
candidates for that are buying

00:06:28.888-->00:06:35.528
for that office. Um, and we’ll
also get state election websites
that we may be interested in as

00:06:35.528-->00:06:41.368
well. Ah we process all of that
through ah our Electionbuster
tool and we have other

00:06:41.368-->00:06:46.373
assessment tools and a grading
rubric that we use at the end.
Um, we do a lot of manual

00:06:48.942-->00:06:54.547
analysis. We’ve automated a lot
of that. We we we’ve thrown a
lot of that out but there still

00:06:54.547-->00:06:58.485
a ton to do. There have been
several nights where I sit in
the basement and I and I page

00:06:58.485-->00:07:04.224
through a 1-->000 different
results or or web pages ah that
that we went and found. Um, once

00:07:04.224-->00:07:09.229
we found issues, we do attempt
to ah to practice responsible
disclosure. And ah and then we,

00:07:13.166-->00:07:18.171
since we are in Vegas, we party
like rock stars like you guys
did last night. So. >>Ya so ah

00:07:20.173-->00:07:26.446
you know to to basically bring
it down another level, in the
the like top left, we basically

00:07:26.446-->00:07:32.152
did cana- ah ah candidate names
which is basically first name,
last name, party, office, year

00:07:32.152-->00:07:36.790
and state that the candidates
from. We then put that into
Electionbuster which then

00:07:36.790-->00:07:43.096
outputs results files and then
those results files go into ah
phantom JS scripts. Those

00:07:43.096-->00:07:48.101
phantom JS scripts basically
takes pictures of those websites
in ah like in memory. Then we

00:07:50.136-->00:07:56.276
have just a crap load of
screenshots. Those screenshot
then need either manual ah

00:07:56.276-->00:08:02.415
analysis. Um but we are ah also
implementing some fairly simple
neural networks to basically

00:08:02.415-->00:08:08.388
take out ah some of the obvious
things that we don’t really need
to look like. Things like parked

00:08:08.388-->00:08:13.626
domains. Um at the same time, we
are ah getting tons of candidate
websites, alongside voter

00:08:13.626-->00:08:18.965
registration and state websites.
Ah there there are no lists for
those out there. So basically

00:08:18.965-->00:08:24.404
it’s just me watching 13 Marvel
movies making those ah you know
giant lists. Um we’ve then

00:08:24.404-->00:08:29.776
basically do who is look ups and
then send them through basically
online ah security assessment

00:08:29.776-->00:08:35.548
tools. Ah and then we take
re-results files and then to
manual re- ah view ah ah ah

00:08:35.548-->00:08:41.621
there um and if like basically
if somethings fun then we will
be talking about it here and if

00:08:41.621-->00:08:48.161
not then throw it on the pile.
And it’s a giant pile. Ya so
what systems are actually out

00:08:48.161-->00:08:52.465
there? I like to think about as
it basically it being in 3
separate groups. Those

00:08:52.465-->00:08:58.838
controlled by some sort of ah
election officials. Someone from
the government. Ah you know

00:08:58.838-->00:09:03.777
these are just various examples.
Ah you know you have Opscan, ah
touch screen systems, ballot

00:09:05.945-->00:09:10.917
marking devices, you have ah
e-poll books for basically
checking in voters. You have

00:09:10.917-->00:09:17.390
state election websites, um and
then you have voter registration
systems with online interfaces.

00:09:17.390-->00:09:22.295
Ah you also have systems that
are only controlled by
candidates. Ah and those are

00:09:22.295-->00:09:28.768
basically going to be you know
candidate and party websites and
also all of the large data bases

00:09:28.768-->00:09:32.772
where they are taking in
information from a whole heck of
a lot of different sources. And

00:09:32.772-->00:09:38.178
finally you have basically third
party sites. Stuff like PAC and
stuff from non-profits, you

00:09:38.178-->00:09:43.783
known Rock the Vote, that sort
of stuff. Um this you know
infographic, what it’s you know

00:09:43.783-->00:09:48.788
really trying to show here is ah
is how information flows from a
voter ah into different into

00:09:50.890-->00:09:57.430
various parts of the information
system. Um ah there’s you know 3
main ways that I would say that

00:09:57.430-->00:10:03.303
you know you know information
leaves a voter here. Ah voters
voluntarily give information to

00:10:03.303-->00:10:09.476
ah candidate websites and
parties. Um so that’s ah that’s
gonna be like first name, party

00:10:09.476-->00:10:16.216
affiliation, money. Um and
that’s you know a ah a you know
that’s a voluntary transfer of

00:10:16.216-->00:10:21.554
information and that’s what blue
represents here. Ah and than
candidate websites you know put

00:10:21.554-->00:10:26.192
that information into the
campaign information data basis
in the bottom left hand corner.

00:10:26.192-->00:10:31.197
Ah in order to vote, you like um
must give information to your
state or lo- ah ah or locality.

00:10:35.335-->00:10:41.407
Um and then that information is
then provided to the statewide
voter registration systems. It

00:10:41.407-->00:10:44.444
is at like that point where
there is something interesting
there in that ah like campions

00:10:44.444-->00:10:49.849
can basically ask for
information from the ah the
statewide registration system

00:10:49.849-->00:10:54.854
and then also um they may have
to ah pay for it but like as ah
you know in order to vote you

00:11:00.827-->00:11:05.465
like essentially you have to
give your personal information
to these you know large

00:11:05.465-->00:11:10.904
candidates um and parties. On
the right hand side, we have
basically a whole different kind

00:11:10.904-->00:11:15.341
of of information transaction
and that basically is going to
be voter sections. The stuff you

00:11:15.341-->00:11:20.346
put on ballots, put into voting
systems ah which you know
ultimately get angulated and

00:11:20.346-->00:11:25.985
tabulated in and you know make
their way to basically like ah
state election websites. >>For

00:11:25.985-->00:11:32.692
me it came as a surprise that
that we gather all this
information and then we offer it

00:11:32.692-->00:11:37.897
for sale. Ah they gathered it
for free or ah they gathered it
to register you but then its

00:11:37.897-->00:11:42.902
offered for sale. >>Yep. That’s
someone who works in big data he
he is very interested in that.

00:11:45.905-->00:11:51.344
Um. [presenter laughs] Ya so
what sort of ah tax happened in
the 2016 elections. Um, you know

00:11:51.344-->00:11:58.051
this really helps to frame this
kind of effort especially in the
tw-tw-two years. We have a lot

00:11:58.051-->00:12:02.989
more detail in the back of our
slides. Um ah and so you like
can catch that later. Um but

00:12:05.491-->00:12:10.496
what we really saw like I think
summed up into one slide is
basically fishing of campaigns

00:12:12.565-->00:12:18.404
voting service and ah providers
and manufactures along elected
officials. We also saw typo

00:12:18.404-->00:12:25.111
squatting on campaign funding
sites and ah then party
contractor-controlled domains.

00:12:25.111-->00:12:31.417
And so like basically you know
whatever IT company is basically
helping some party. We also saw

00:12:31.417-->00:12:36.589
social media manipulation and
disinformation. We didn’t do
anything with that. There are

00:12:36.589-->00:12:42.228
actually data breaches at the
federal, state and local levels
of um you know of you know

00:12:42.228-->00:12:47.233
private data essentially um. And
we also saw data breaches in
candidate and campaign systems.

00:12:49.402-->00:12:53.506
And so basically, you know if
there where data to be breached
over the past last couple,

00:12:53.506-->00:12:58.044
couple years, it has at least
happened once. And one of them
was here at Defcon inside one of

00:12:58.044-->00:13:04.651
the um you know voter hacking
village. Ah you know big big
shout out to the voter hacking

00:13:04.651-->00:13:09.989
village right. Ah really really
cool if you haven’t stopped by
you should. Um so they basically

00:13:09.989-->00:13:16.963
found a ah you know county
information database essentially
ah like on a e-poll book and it

00:13:16.963-->00:13:21.968
was part of the voting
ma-machines that they got ah a a
hold up. And then there was like

00:13:24.170-->00:13:30.309
basically direct attacks on ah
online registration systems and
campaign infrastructure. >>And

00:13:30.309-->00:13:35.315
here’s my campaigns 101 slide.
Um, so for this for this
mid-term ah ah election cycle,

00:13:40.787-->00:13:46.192
there thousands of candidates
that are running. Um, we’ve
scanned a lot of them, we’ve

00:13:46.192-->00:13:52.932
scanned most of them but I’m
sure we’ve not scanned all of
them. Ah we’ve we’ve got we’ve

00:13:52.932-->00:13:57.937
got a ton of information ah and
as you might expect, these
campaigns are are pretty small

00:13:59.972-->00:14:06.679
and ah these guys have little or
no IT experience. Um and then
you have just the opposite of

00:14:06.679-->00:14:12.318
that. You have the larger
campaigns which might have a
sophisticated ah staff and ah

00:14:12.318-->00:14:17.323
huge IT staff. Ah we we did
observe campaigns that are being
run purely from Facebook or

00:14:19.792-->00:14:26.299
Twitter, Instagram and Snapchat.
And maybe that’s what the the
future holds is ah are small

00:14:26.299-->00:14:31.304
campaigns like that are are
cheap and they are secure. Maybe
so. >>I like it. Ya, ah back in

00:14:35.108-->00:14:41.914
2012. Here is some of our you
know fairly early tw- ah 2012
findings. Um you know the really

00:14:41.914-->00:14:46.919
big thing that we that we found
was like a fake DNC and a fake
RNC accepting donations. Um ah

00:14:49.288-->00:14:55.528
and then we also found a couple
in- infected political action
committee sites. What you can

00:14:55.528-->00:15:02.068
see here is at the at the bottom
is a screenshot of a Google
search result um called Our

00:15:02.068-->00:15:07.640
Country Deserves Better PAC. Um
and im not sure if they really
want to be selling Viagra. I

00:15:07.640-->00:15:14.080
don’t know what they are trying
to say our country’s needing to
get better at. But um so

00:15:14.080-->00:15:17.116
basically, they have been
compromised and they are
basically actively hacking

00:15:17.116-->00:15:22.121
pharma- pharma-pharmaceuticals.
Um this is ah you know this is
the fake DNC site that we that

00:15:24.457-->00:15:29.462
we found at that date in time in
2012. Ah the ah DNC did not own
Democratic National Committee

00:15:31.697-->00:15:36.702
dot org. Um someone else did. Ah
there was also a ah you know RNC
corollary as well. Um and this

00:15:40.239-->00:15:45.244
ah it’s an okay site. It doesn’t
super look fishy or odd ah but
there is a nice big make a

00:15:47.680-->00:15:53.619
donation button there and those
um you know what I mean ah could
tell they were actively taking

00:15:53.619-->00:15:58.624
ah contributions and not passing
them along to the the ah DNC. Ah
we reported this to the FBI ah

00:16:01.828-->00:16:08.701
and they were you know
subsequently taken down. >>In
2014, that’s that’s when I was

00:16:08.701-->00:16:13.706
really brought under the project
by Joshy he he brought me in to
ah to look at some of the code

00:16:13.706-->00:16:18.544
or to give him a hand with some
analysis. Ah and it was really
our first iteration of

00:16:18.544-->00:16:23.549
ElectionBusters. Um we did find
some NRC NRCC sites that could
potentially confuse voters. So

00:16:27.253-->00:16:31.624
you might be thinking that your
donating to a certain candidate
but you’re really giving to the

00:16:31.624-->00:16:37.296
other guys. Um we found that
some of the candidate sites
where where actively

00:16:37.296-->00:16:43.669
distributing malware. Um we also
found some leakage of of
sensitive who is information.

00:16:43.669-->00:16:50.409
And it did it did highlight the
need to focus on on your
analysis. >>Ya ya I mean so, so

00:16:50.409-->00:16:57.149
this looks to to be a pro Ann
Kirkpatrick website. Its got
great web design, it’s got a you

00:16:57.149-->00:17:03.122
know, very nice picture. It’s
got a very large donate button
right. That’s like 1/8th of the

00:17:03.122-->00:17:10.062
whole page is that 1 donate
button. Um and but ah what you
don’t realize is that if you

00:17:10.062-->00:17:15.468
don’t read that small black text
is that your actually voting for
her ah opponent. And we saw 12

00:17:15.468-->00:17:20.006
other sites like like these and
there was ah a you know little
box at the very very bottom of

00:17:20.006-->00:17:24.777
all these sites that said owned
and operated by the National
Republican Congressional

00:17:24.777-->00:17:29.782
Committee. Um ya and those where
really interesting. Ah we found
another one here. This is Phil

00:17:32.151-->00:17:37.156
Gingrey, I think his first name.
He was running for Senate in
Georgia. Um his site was just ah

00:17:39.158-->00:17:45.097
basically distributing malware
to anyone who happened to stop
by. Um probably not the best way

00:17:45.097-->00:17:50.202
to get campaign contributions um
is to you know have a nice
dropper there. Um ya we actually

00:17:50.202-->00:17:55.207
tried to contact him via Twitter
to no avail. Ah and this is
where we first ran into you know

00:17:57.610-->00:18:01.681
responsible disclosure being a
big big problem and saying
actually it’s kinda difficult to

00:18:01.681-->00:18:08.454
contact these folks to let them
know. Ah that they need to sort
their stuff out. >>and this is

00:18:08.454-->00:18:13.459
the output from our
ElectionBuster application. Ah
its its a directed graph, is ah

00:18:15.661-->00:18:20.333
the representation here. Perhaps
the text is very difficult for
you to read ah out in the

00:18:20.333-->00:18:25.938
audience but at the center here
you can see ah it’s Hillary’s
main site. Hillary for president

00:18:25.938-->00:18:31.610
dot com. This is data that we
collected on election day of
2016. I took that data and put

00:18:31.610-->00:18:38.150
it into R. There’s an igraph
package in R that’s good for
network diagrams. Um some of

00:18:38.150-->00:18:43.155
the, some of the nodes around it
are Jeb for president, ah Rubio
2018, um let’s see, Walker dot

00:18:48.794-->00:18:53.799
vote and ah Cruz sucks. [speaker
laughs]. Okay ya, I got that in
the mic really well. So um. But

00:18:57.169-->00:19:03.776
but what you can see is, you can
see ah how she is ah, I saw
examples on both sides, but how

00:19:03.776-->00:19:08.147
she is ah squatting on the
domains names of several of her
competitors. Which is a common

00:19:08.147-->00:19:13.152
practice, certainly not illegal.
And here is one for Donald Trump
in the 2016 election. He did the

00:19:17.289-->00:19:23.029
same thing ah or or someone did
the same thing. I don’t know if
it was, if-if he did this but

00:19:23.029-->00:19:28.034
ah. Jeb Bush is being redirected
to donaldjtrump. Ah we have
presidentcruz and we

00:19:32.171-->00:19:37.176
jebforpresident. Ted2016 is
going there as well. These are
the fun graphs to draw. And this

00:19:40.813-->00:19:45.818
ones really tiny. So this ah
2018. This is ah middle of July
of this past month. Um let’s see

00:19:49.121-->00:19:54.126
what we have.
Gillibrand-gillibrandforpresiden
t. Ah rock2020 >>Dwayne the Rock

00:19:57.930-->00:20:02.935
Johnson. >>Dwayne, ya. Ah.
>>Jumanji. >>And. >>Trump
for-for Prez, friends of friends

00:20:06.906-->00:20:11.911
of Trump. >>Ya it’s a not as
exciting. >>Ya here we go. So,
here’s where, we’ve been doing

00:20:15.481-->00:20:20.920
this for a little while and we
ah saw one of our biggest
failures in our, in our project.

00:20:20.920-->00:20:25.624
And I think that’s okay. It’s
you know ah good to ah take
lessons learned but it was

00:20:25.624-->00:20:31.864
unfortunate that this was such a
big lessons learned moment. Ah
so we took ah ah ElectionBuster

00:20:31.864-->00:20:36.869
and made a a version of it made
for Pacs um and ah like other
NGO type organizations. Um and

00:20:39.772-->00:20:46.445
we actually pointed it at
ActBlue which is the primary
funding platform for the ah you

00:20:46.445-->00:20:50.483
know for the Democratic party.
Um and what you would you know
like what you would do is if

00:20:50.483-->00:20:56.755
you’re a candidate, you
basically take ActBlue ah and
embedded their widget into your

00:20:56.755-->00:21:03.596
site and you can take money. Um
you know resent indictments
though from ah Muller ah show

00:21:03.596-->00:21:10.436
that when the foreign
adversary’s got into the DNC and
DCCC systems, ah they actually

00:21:10.436-->00:21:15.441
redirected the main ah, you know
ah URL on their website to
actblue to actblues dot ah ah

00:21:19.745-->00:21:24.750
dot com. Um we actually a month
ago ah we found out that we had
found actblues.com in our

00:21:28.687-->00:21:34.393
searches um back in 2016. So
while it was going on. We
actually looked at that site in

00:21:34.393-->00:21:41.200
the face. Ah we said this site
looks reasonable. Um it seems to
have good web design. Ah there’s

00:21:41.200-->00:21:48.140
nothing immediately odd. The you
know who’s information is normal
and ah it seems to be hosted in

00:21:48.140-->00:21:54.547
a different spot. But no big
deal, ah cloudflare. You now. Um
and so we basically stared this

00:21:54.547-->00:22:00.152
stuff straight in the face in
2016 and did not realize it.
This shows how hard detection

00:22:00.152-->00:22:05.157
actually is. >>So far this year
in 2018, ah we took the Python
code that we had in, I think it

00:22:08.861-->00:22:15.267
was Python code 2 dot 5 and-
>>7. 7. 2 dot 7. >>2 dot 7. Okay
and ah. [audience laughs] And

00:22:15.267-->00:22:20.272
put it into Python3. Ah the the
threading model that we were
using in in the previous version

00:22:22.474-->00:22:28.914
is different then then the
process ah model that we are
using now in in Python3 so ah we

00:22:28.914-->00:22:34.320
also had some new variance of
templates for Pacs. Ah we we
included election websites and

00:22:34.320-->00:22:39.425
manufactures websites. Ah and we
started correlating
ElectionBuster data with open

00:22:39.425-->00:22:44.430
source threat intelligence
information. And we started
writing a version of EvilURL and

00:22:50.836-->00:22:53.706
DNStwist and realized there’s
something there already and ah
we we decided not to, not to

00:22:53.706-->00:22:58.477
continue that development. Just
take advantage of the good work
that folks have already done and

00:22:58.477-->00:23:05.317
utilize those tools. Ah and we
did start looking for some
homographic ah attacks. Ya you

00:23:05.317-->00:23:10.322
do Linda. >>Linda. Whats up
Linda. Um ya so ah Linda Coleman
ah is a ah, you know i-is

00:23:14.560-->00:23:19.565
someone running for state office
in North Ca-Carolina. Um so
since she was ah state she was

00:23:19.565-->00:23:26.338
generally under our radar. Um
she had previously ran for Lt.
Governor. Um ah her old Lt.

00:23:26.338-->00:23:31.343
Governor domain ah had its code
stripped from Wayback Machine.
Ah her old d-domain was actually

00:23:34.246-->00:23:40.519
purchased ah and someone named
Evon Gusev or you know even
Gusev. I’m saying it wrong,

00:23:40.519-->00:23:46.992
Sorry. Ah. >>Ivan. >>Ivan. Why
do I keep saying it wrong. Ivan
Gusev. Ah you know left his name

00:23:46.992-->00:23:51.230
in the WHOIS information there.
Um we did a little bit of
research, this is assumed to be

00:23:51.230-->00:23:56.101
a fake name. Ah not necessarily
politically mo-motivated. Um
what you can see if that this

00:23:56.101-->00:24:02.875
this is you know Linda’s old ah
lu- Lieutenant Governor ah page
ah, sorry domain and page, um

00:24:02.875-->00:24:08.580
this was lindafornc dot com. In
yellow there, you can see
something in French talking

00:24:08.580-->00:24:12.785
about purchasing
pharma-pharmaceuticals. If you
click donate ah, you are not

00:24:12.785-->00:24:18.891
going to be offered an
opportunity to donate to her
campaign, you are going to be

00:24:18.891-->00:24:25.431
buying Viagra. That’s the thread
through this talk. Um ya ah so
it’s really really wired though.

00:24:25.431-->00:24:30.436
Um in some WHOIS interfaces, um
you know it actually said Yvonne
Gusev. Um and you know this one

00:24:33.472-->00:24:39.478
i-i-it just shows basically a
Russian national ah, you know,
owns this domain. We don’t

00:24:39.478-->00:24:43.782
necessary think this is
politically motivated. I just
think this person purchased this

00:24:43.782-->00:24:48.787
and was just trying to ah cast a
wide net in selling their
pharmaceuticals. But um, we’re

00:24:52.624-->00:24:59.231
not sure. >>You saw the results
of the ElectionBuster ah output
that I showed you before with

00:24:59.231-->00:25:05.637
the graphs and ah and I think
some of the, some of the intent
is to say you need to be

00:25:05.637-->00:25:11.110
proactive and you need to
protect your domain name space
and ah you need to be ah you

00:25:11.110-->00:25:15.914
need to buy some domain names
that are associated with your,
could be associated with you.

00:25:15.914-->00:25:21.787
This guy carried it to the Nth.
Um he he went a little nuts and
he bought ah all of these names,

00:25:21.787-->00:25:27.893
all around his ah his name space
and I I think it’s great but but
maybe it’s a little bit

00:25:27.893-->00:25:34.800
overkill. I think there’s 37 ah
websites there but ah that’s
cool. >>Go Pete. [presenter

00:25:34.800-->00:25:39.805
laughs] >>Go Pete. Pete for
Congress. Comrade. [audience
laughs] >>Ya so, this is ah, so

00:25:46.812-->00:25:53.719
this is a site that is you know
electdevinnunuz dot com. Ah
someone wasn’t happy with him.

00:25:53.719-->00:26:00.092
Ah and made a nice tribute. Ah,
you know, ah basically coded in
the ah, you know sickle and

00:26:00.092-->00:26:04.229
hammer and all that. Um ah so if
you scroll down here, you would
see a whole bunch of Russian

00:26:04.229-->00:26:10.169
oriented ah you know pictures
with Devin. Some really decent
photoshops. I think this site is

00:26:10.169-->00:26:14.306
still active if you want to
visit it your ah self. There
didn’t seem to be anything wrong

00:26:14.306-->00:26:19.778
with it. Ah but this is sort of
an example of um you know a free
speech issue. This isn’t

00:26:19.778-->00:26:24.149
necessarily illegal or you know
by any means. We saw this time
and time again. Folks just

00:26:24.149-->00:26:30.255
really wanted to ah ah you know
throw out these sorts of
domains. Um another one that we

00:26:30.255-->00:26:35.260
saw was ah ah Jillibran sucks or
Gillibrand sucks dot dot com. I
think she’s ah she’s a Domocrate

00:26:38.030-->00:26:43.035
from New York. And um she had ah
this domain purchased against
her and it was redirected to the

00:26:45.404-->00:26:51.944
Democratic Socialists of America
page. Um you know, what to show
like some funny stuff about both

00:26:51.944-->00:26:57.916
sides there. Um here’s Carly
fir-fir-fir ah Firorina’s ah
current page. Um you know really

00:26:57.916-->00:27:04.156
nice. It looks it looks awesome.
Nothing, nothing fishy here. But
then we found that her old site

00:27:04.156-->00:27:10.863
from like 2000 is still going. I
don’t know what kind of campaign
money you you get to purchase

00:27:10.863-->00:27:16.268
like ah domain for 20 years and
hosting for 20 years. Um but
it’s kinda you know, it’s kind

00:27:16.268-->00:27:20.772
of interesting. We saw tons of
this. Candidates just leave
their old campaign websites up

00:27:20.772-->00:27:25.777
forever. Um I don’t understand
why ah ya ya. It’s just kind of
odd. >>And I’ll talk a little

00:27:30.482-->00:27:36.288
about the Congressional site
statistics. Um the stats that we
are going to show include

00:27:36.288-->00:27:42.861
everyone running for senate that
we could identify. Um all house
incumbents are included in these

00:27:42.861-->00:27:48.300
stats. Ah we we included some of
the races we deemed important.
Ah there there were too many

00:27:48.300-->00:27:54.139
candidates for us to ah to
include in some of this
information. Um and likely there

00:27:54.139-->00:27:59.144
are skewing towards incumbents.
Um and majority of these scans
we took in June of this year. We

00:28:01.380-->00:28:06.018
we did relay on Ballotpedia for
pulling some of the candidate
information. >>Thank you

00:28:06.018-->00:28:12.824
Ballotpedia. You are awesome.
>>So I’m going to let Josh talk
about some of these but I wanna

00:28:12.824-->00:28:17.829
I wanna say there’s ah in this
grading scheme, there’s an A+.
And there’s an A, there’s a B. A

00:28:20.332-->00:28:25.337
an A is good. All the way down
to T and F. Ah and then there’s
no grade. I wanted to put an F-

00:28:27.839-->00:28:33.779
on the no grade but Jo-Josh
wouldn’t let me put an F- there
but. >>This is the output from

00:28:33.779-->00:28:38.483
our you know you know online
scanners that we aren’t allowed
to mention be-because of

00:28:38.483-->00:28:43.055
licensing issues. But we are
looking at TLS implementations
and there’s grades involved. You

00:28:43.055-->00:28:49.661
figure it out. Um ya so um
what’s really great to mention
here is that like over 50

00:28:49.661-->00:28:56.468
percent of the you know folks in
in the house you know ah, over
60 percent have a ah score of B

00:28:56.468-->00:29:02.341
or better. Um there are about 30
percent of the folks out there
ah running for house um have

00:29:02.341-->00:29:07.346
either no TLS or SSL or they
have a major cert issue. Um and
we wanted to try to contact all

00:29:09.915-->00:29:15.087
these folks but i-i-it got
really ah time consuming really
quickly to go to each of their

00:29:15.087-->00:29:19.891
pages and look at all the
information there and find an
e-mail address. Um ya it got to

00:29:19.891-->00:29:24.796
be really really difficult. Um
if you look at the Senate
though. Ah tops House, bottoms

00:29:24.796-->00:29:30.702
Senate. Um Senate fairs so much
better. About just 80 percent of
folks just have an A. Ah and

00:29:30.702-->00:29:36.608
then ah you know 4 percent had
some sort of issue. Ah we think
that’s because you know Senate

00:29:36.608-->00:29:42.180
campaigns are generally ah
better funded. And ah they ah ya
ya. I mean um. I think that

00:29:42.180-->00:29:47.786
that’s probably just the answer.
That they are better funded and
around for 6 for 6 years. Ah if

00:29:47.786-->00:29:51.223
you look at some of the
congressional TLS
implementations, ah you know

00:29:51.223-->00:29:56.228
from left to right we have you
know TLS 1 point 0, 1 point 1, 1
point 2, 1 point 3. Um and then

00:29:58.530-->00:30:04.970
what you see is that on the
giant bar is the, you know,
total folks in the house who su-

00:30:04.970-->00:30:11.309
supported that that version of
TLS in the tiny ah ah bar is the
total amount of people in the

00:30:11.309-->00:30:16.314
Senate who support that you know
ah that version. What you see if
very small usage of TLS 1 point

00:30:18.316-->00:30:25.057
3 which just came out. TLS 1
point 3 that’s awesome. Um but
ah you know most folks had TLS 1

00:30:25.057-->00:30:30.062
point 2. Ah fewer had 1 point 0
and even fewer had 1 point 0. Um
and no one had SSL. Which is

00:30:33.131-->00:30:39.371
kind of interesting. Really
wasn’t expecting that. >>Let’s
look to the states. Ah this the

00:30:39.371-->00:30:44.643
states and local jurisdictions,
they also have websites, they
they host election websites as

00:30:44.643-->00:30:50.916
well. Um those election
websites, they provide ah
information, results and and

00:30:50.916-->00:30:55.921
they help register voters. Ah
the sites could be hosted by the
Secretary of State, um the State

00:30:58.590-->00:31:06.298
Board of Elections ah or some
other third party group like
Cloudflare or Google. Um the

00:31:06.298-->00:31:14.372
overwhelming majority ah use dot
gov, ah top level domain. Others
use a dot us or dot org TLD. Um

00:31:14.372-->00:31:20.979
and about half of the voter
registration systems they they
move from dot gov to dot us or

00:31:20.979-->00:31:28.754
dot org. Ah just not sure why.
Its there’s a little a little
chaotic there. >>Back one.

00:31:28.754-->00:31:33.725
You’re going everywhere man you
just. Ya so this is what 1 of
those voter registration systems

00:31:33.725-->00:31:38.630
look like. Honestly there just a
web app. Um and I mean you know
you basically just put in

00:31:38.630-->00:31:43.001
information about who you are.
There’s basically knowledge
based auth- authentication going

00:31:43.001-->00:31:50.942
on. And um this is how you
register to vote in 37 out of 56
states and territories. Um

00:31:50.942-->00:31:59.951
speaking about the 56 states and
territories, American Samoa is
not like ah unincorporated U.S.

00:31:59.951-->00:32:07.092
territory. Um they actually run
separate dot gov and dot org
sites. Which is fairly common.

00:32:07.092-->00:32:14.232
We don’t know why. Um maybe the
older dot org site gets ah you
know kept alive. I’m just

00:32:14.232-->00:32:19.671
I-I-I’m just really unclear to
why that happens. Ah they were
using Drupal and they were ah

00:32:19.671-->00:32:26.244
basically affected by a Drupal
vulnerability. As you do. Um and
they actually were dis- you know

00:32:26.244-->00:32:33.051
distributing malware to all the
folks who came to their site. Um
it was something that we ah, you

00:32:33.051-->00:32:38.790
know, contacted them ah ah
about. There’s a big time
difference there obviously. Um

00:32:38.790-->00:32:47.299
ah we actually called them up.
Um they were a 1 person IT
operation. Um and ah they tried

00:32:47.299-->00:32:54.206
to fix it. Ah and then it kept
coming back. Um ah and then um
it ended up being that you could

00:32:54.206-->00:32:59.377
only get the malware version of
their site if it came from an IP
outside of the U.S. which is

00:32:59.377-->00:33:04.049
really strange. I don’t quite
understand what’s going on
there. Maybe they knew about us

00:33:04.049-->00:33:08.053
or something. I have no idea,
something weird was going on
there. Um this is what the you

00:33:08.053-->00:33:12.924
know effected website looked
like. You can see that the you
know chrome address bar in the

00:33:12.924-->00:33:17.229
top, you know in the top left
saying that this is, this is
dangerous. Um and so this was

00:33:17.229-->00:33:23.668
you know
AmericanSamoaelectionoffice.org
is the website here. Um and then

00:33:23.668-->00:33:28.673
then stuff started to get weird
when we were reviewing ah
everything for this talk. We

00:33:28.673-->00:33:34.246
sort of realized that American
Samoa Election Office dot org
was mentioned in the leaked NSA

00:33:34.246-->00:33:43.889
Reality Winner memo. Um and that
um that memo talked about ah
foreign adversaries sending

00:33:43.889-->00:33:51.196
malware ah to effect the
American Samoa election office
systems. Um this is really weird

00:33:51.196-->00:33:55.467
and they were the only election
office that we found that was
you know actively hosting

00:33:55.467-->00:34:00.305
malware. Um although strange, we
do believe this to be
coincidental. Um partially

00:34:00.305-->00:34:07.545
because it just seems to be a
random Drupal vuln that was ex-
like exploited. Um and the fact

00:34:07.545-->00:34:12.951
that you have to come from
outside of the U.S. in order to
get the page. Um but we’re not

00:34:12.951-->00:34:21.393
quite sure. Is this me? Okay ah
so ah remember there are voter
registration systems um and then

00:34:21.393-->00:34:26.898
there are State Board of
Election websites. And we put
those into 2 different buckets.

00:34:26.898-->00:34:30.368
They host 2 different types of
information. Very very different
ah sensitivity of the

00:34:30.368-->00:34:36.775
information there. Um so the
voter registration site grades
um, you know, everyone has heard

00:34:36.775-->00:34:41.413
of these systems being under
attack over the past 2 years. Um
you know what’s really great

00:34:41.413-->00:34:48.553
news, ah is that an overwhelming
majority got over score of B or
better. That’s awesome. You know

00:34:48.553-->00:34:55.794
um, I think that’s really really
sweet. We did have 2 F’s. Um
there um and we had a C as-as-as

00:34:55.794-->00:35:01.833
well. Um we think this is really
cool information to have because
its sort of a like a measurable

00:35:01.833-->00:35:06.237
thing that folks can be you know
that can be graded against in
the future to see if we are

00:35:06.237-->00:35:14.145
getting better, worse, what have
you. Um when we contacted the
first F ah state there um ah

00:35:14.145-->00:35:18.883
they fixed it immediately. They
were extremely happy to get that
information. There were like

00:35:18.883-->00:35:23.755
we-ah like ah you know cyber
security is really important to
us. Um and they fixed it ASAP.

00:35:23.755-->00:35:30.228
Ah the other C and the and and
the ah ah the other F um it was
a little more complicated. We

00:35:30.228-->00:35:36.768
are 2 guys coming from you know
Gmail addresses so that um, that
doesn’t look awesome. It’s

00:35:36.768-->00:35:42.640
probably a good thing that they
were really ah worried and you
know on-on guard against people

00:35:42.640-->00:35:50.215
fishing them. But um it-it took
over a month to get a-a response
from them. Um and the only way

00:35:50.215-->00:35:53.818
we were able to get a response
was to go through backend
channels. Um and we will also

00:35:53.818-->00:35:58.990
talk about how to I’m- you know
how to improve that later. Um,
all of these are all fixed now

00:35:58.990-->00:36:04.763
which is dope. Um ya so HSTS use
inside of voter regis- ah you
know inside of voter

00:36:04.763-->00:36:11.836
registration systems. Um so we
saw um that not a lot of folks,
only about 25 percent of the VR

00:36:11.836-->00:36:17.909
systems had HSTS. This is HTTP
strict transport ah security.
And this can basically help stop

00:36:17.909-->00:36:22.847
ah man in the middle attacks
when your, you know initially
re- ah requesting the HTTP

00:36:22.847-->00:36:31.756
version of a page vs a HTTPS
version of the page. Um no one
was on the HTT, sorry was on the

00:36:31.756-->00:36:35.860
HSTS preload list and we think
that would be a really great
thing for voter registration

00:36:35.860-->00:36:41.966
systems to basically sign up
for. 10 minutes till the show
starts. Okay. Um that was an all

00:36:41.966-->00:36:47.705
that reference. Ah ah voter
registration vulnera-
vulnerabilities. There was no

00:36:47.705-->00:36:52.510
heartbleed. There was no poodle.
Um we did see some robot. We had
difficulties parsing those ah

00:36:52.510-->00:36:58.683
results for some reason so there
not displayed here. Ah beast was
a fairly common ah ah ah

00:36:58.683-->00:37:02.987
occurrence there. Ah there are a
number of states still have that
in there. Not the biggest issue

00:37:02.987-->00:37:08.993
um but definitely wanting to see
if we can get that sorted an and
cleaned up. You want to do this

00:37:08.993-->00:37:17.535
one? Ah okay okay mow through.
So ah so they election sites, um
typically ah states have um a ah

00:37:17.535-->00:37:22.774
like a Department of State site
or a Secretary of State site.
They might also have a State

00:37:22.774-->00:37:27.312
Board of Election site. They
might just have a voter
registration site to tell you

00:37:27.312-->00:37:32.684
were to go register to vote and
lead you to their voter
registration system and they

00:37:32.684-->00:37:40.058
might also have a results site.
So you can imagine results dot
pennsyltucky dot gov. Um about

00:37:40.058-->00:37:45.463
20 percent of the folks um ah
you know of the sites that we
took a look at had some critical

00:37:45.463-->00:37:53.071
issue. Typically just not using
TLS or a having a search shared
with a couple 100 sites. Which

00:37:53.071-->00:37:58.109
is a little bit weird. Um that
was sort of like a cloud um
misconfiguration issue we think.

00:37:58.109-->00:38:03.982
Still haven’t got that com- that
completely sorted. Um I think
the only way, you know initially

00:38:03.982-->00:38:09.521
we were being told by states
that they don’t need to have TLS
on their websites. Um it wasn’t

00:38:09.521-->00:38:17.262
un-until that we said this
doesn’t just protect you, this
actually protects your voters as

00:38:17.262-->00:38:22.300
well ah, that we started to see
that that argument seemed to
have some weight with them. Um

00:38:22.300-->00:38:29.107
and all these aren’t quite
sorted yet but we’re working to
get these sorted. Um these these

00:38:29.107-->00:38:33.578
sites were a little bit older.
Um, they were a little bit worse
off. Ah Robot was also in about

00:38:33.578-->00:38:39.017
half probably. Beast was in half
and they also Poodle. No one had
Heartbleed, again, which is

00:38:39.017-->00:38:42.587
awesome. That’s a great news.
People should be saying good
things when we have good news

00:38:42.587-->00:38:49.360
right. Um, everything’s not on
fire. Um, you’re up. >>So it
turns out that vendor sites, ah

00:38:49.360-->00:38:56.835
ven- vendors have websites too.
So these are the people that
might produce ah ah some of the

00:38:56.835-->00:39:02.106
software or some of the
hardware. Um might be some
voting system resellers and

00:39:02.106-->00:39:14.185
could be voter registration ah
vendors or voting service
providers. And we we saw some

00:39:14.185-->00:39:17.488
failures here as well. Ah we did
contact the vendors. Good news
here is we did contact the

00:39:17.488-->00:39:22.360
vendors and they were able to
address everything pretty pretty
quickly. >>Except for 1.

00:39:22.360-->00:39:27.232
>>Except for 1. >>Who kinda got
crappy with me. Ah, it sorta
turned into a this is not a

00:39:27.232-->00:39:35.039
vulnerability. Don’t call this a
vulnerability. You’re a
vulnerability type- type- type

00:39:35.039-->00:39:41.346
issue. [audience laughs] Um and
I was like listen, I don’t I
don’t care. Fix it, fix it. Um

00:39:41.346-->00:39:45.283
you know kinda they were like
don’t ever talk about this to
anyone. Um. >>So we’re not

00:39:45.283-->00:39:52.490
saying anything. [audience
laughs] Um. Ah and I think we
are at the recommendations.

00:39:52.490-->00:39:57.895
>>Okay okay. We got 7 minutes
left, we got this. Okay
recommendations to campaigns. Ah

00:39:57.895-->00:40:03.768
you know beware what you click.
Everyone already knows this. Ah
you know 2 factor um, you know

00:40:03.768-->00:40:12.143
auth even on personal accounts.
Um I think that the campaigns
definitely know this now. Um ah

00:40:12.143-->00:40:18.216
but here’s a big one that still
isn’t really ah ah addressed. If
you’re going to run a website,

00:40:18.216-->00:40:23.388
your need to basically
defensively typosquat on your
own name. Um you you just

00:40:23.388-->00:40:29.827
definitely need to. Ah we have a
basically a a giant list of of
ones that you should purchase.

00:40:29.827-->00:40:36.267
Um in the back ah that we saw as
being most common. Um if you
want these sites, ah sorry if

00:40:36.267-->00:40:43.174
you want these slides, you can
go to Donald J Trump dot vote.
Um and ah so [audience laughs]

00:40:43.174-->00:40:52.517
seriously, ah so ah basically
use a trusted digital cert
please. You know, you know TLS 1

00:40:52.517-->00:40:59.324
point 2 or better strong strong
cipher suites. Ah you HSTS,
especially if you’re a long term

00:40:59.324-->00:41:07.098
incumbent. Um ah get on that
preload list. Ah consider EV
certs. Um work with ISPs and FBI

00:41:07.098-->00:41:14.405
for domain take takedowns. Um
and run you know free you know
assessment tools on your own

00:41:14.405-->00:41:22.513
domain. Um for states, again 2
fa- 2 factor auth. Ah you know
ah specially with your you know

00:41:22.513-->00:41:29.153
personal de-devices, password,
hygiene, all that. Re- like
purchase common domains. Like

00:41:29.153-->00:41:34.659
register pennsyltucky dot com.
Um cause folks are out there and
they are going to be doing that

00:41:34.659-->00:41:40.565
that you know that sort of
stuff. Um ah maintain a trusted
cert. This was a big issue.

00:41:40.565-->00:41:47.171
States just didn’t have trusted
certs. Use TLS. Um that’s a
really reasonable baseline web

00:41:47.171-->00:41:53.845
thing. Um get on the HSTS
preload list. Ah it is free. It
is one sheet of paper online you

00:41:53.845-->00:42:00.651
have to fill out. Um if you
don’t have a dot gov site,
please get a dot gov site

00:42:00.651-->00:42:06.457
because that was a big issue.
Does anyone know the do- the
domain to get a dot gov site?

00:42:06.457-->00:42:15.633
Dot gov dot gov. [presenter
laughs] Ya, um well played. Um
ya um so you know the ah the ah

00:42:15.633-->00:42:23.141
EI-ISAC and DHS are the there to
basically help with threat intel
and remediation. Run open source

00:42:23.141-->00:42:28.379
tools against your own domain.
Ah don’t just trust other other
folks ah but you know do get

00:42:28.379-->00:42:35.420
outside assessments. Vet them
first. Make it easy to contact
you. It was extremely difficult

00:42:35.420-->00:42:40.258
for someone in this room to
contact an election official
about some kind of vuln in their

00:42:40.258-->00:42:47.465
site. Um ah also ah there’s like
a big new international standard
out there. Um and you can ah,

00:42:47.465-->00:42:52.837
you know it basically talks
about the best ways to make
yourself available. I think that

00:42:52.837-->00:42:57.642
states definitely should take a
look at that standard. Um you
know use something like security

00:42:57.642-->00:43:04.382
at pennsyltucky dot gov or alert
at pennsyltucky dot dot gov. you
know the aftermath, 0 sites with

00:43:04.382-->00:43:12.190
SSl, 0 homographs which was very
interesting. We expected those.
Um a lot of HTTP. Ah we had to 2

00:43:12.190-->00:43:16.961
big VR systems with a, you know
with a grade of F, 1 with a
grade of C. Basically contacted

00:43:16.961-->00:43:21.632
campaigns and vendors ah about
all sorts of issues. Um we
contacted all and worked with

00:43:21.632-->00:43:28.739
some states affected by you know
likely typosquats, um su-
suspicious domains, poor you

00:43:28.739-->00:43:35.079
know TLS implementation, known
vulns, ah untrusted certs and
then malware actively on there,

00:43:35.079-->00:43:40.118
on their site. Um little bit of
you know some thoughts on the
U.S. cyber security posture in

00:43:40.118-->00:43:46.090
the next 2 minutes. Ah the
situation is improving yet there
are some common sense ways to

00:43:46.090-->00:43:50.328
you know make things better. Ah
um, at, you know some states are
getting monetary assistance from

00:43:50.328-->00:43:58.236
ah congress but ya we need more
of that. Um the whole community
is responding. You know the ah

00:43:58.236-->00:44:04.008
the ah Center for Internet
Security released an election
you know focused handbook, ah on

00:44:04.008-->00:44:09.614
cyber security in elections. Ah
the ah the Center for Democracy
and Technology and the Center

00:44:09.614-->00:44:16.687
for Technology and Civic Life
basically work together to make
um you know classes for for

00:44:16.687-->00:44:21.826
election officials to learn
cyber security basics. And then
the Defending Digital Democracy

00:44:21.826-->00:44:28.232
effort you know is focusing on
ah campaign cyber on out of
Belford Center in in Harvard.

00:44:28.232-->00:44:34.305
Last slide. Ah you know we need
to continue defending our
elections. We need to you know

00:44:34.305-->00:44:39.810
more, ah better at larger scale
and faster. Um ah so we assessed
the bare minimum of web

00:44:39.810-->00:44:46.317
se-security. What was legal, um
we honestly think we shouldn’t
of found what we you what we ah

00:44:46.317-->00:44:52.156
found. Um ah it is difficult to
talk with election officials
about some of this stuff um, but

00:44:52.156-->00:44:57.295
that doesn’t mean that it’s not
worth it. Ah responsible
disclosure is very important in

00:44:57.295-->00:45:01.232
the field of elections,
especially when folks are
actively using these systems to

00:45:01.232-->00:45:09.407
run elections. Um listen if you
don’t vote, you are helping the
ah ah attackers. Ah your

00:45:09.407-->00:45:15.212
ultimately you know making the
system worse. In my ah ah
opinion, all this can be done by

00:45:15.212-->00:45:20.952
ordinary citizens ah all you
know all of you all can actually
help here right. Um and if you

00:45:20.952-->00:45:24.655
want to help, get involved and
work the polls. Folks really
really need you. I like the woo,

00:45:24.655-->00:45:29.994
I like the woo. Yee Haw.
[audience laughs] That’s what
we’ll do. Okay. Um so for a copy

00:45:29.994-->00:45:34.498
of everything, you can also go
to please go vote. Um thank you
so much everyone. [audience

00:45:34.498-->00:00:00.000
applauds] >>Thanks guys. >>High
five. Cool.
