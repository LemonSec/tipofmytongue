00:00:00.100-->00:00:05.105
>>David is going to talk to us
about drones and ah anti-drone
ah countermeasures, ah beyond ah

00:00:07.407-->00:00:12.479
just simply handing me a drone
remote, because ah I got a drone
and the only thing I can do

00:00:12.479-->00:00:16.917
apparently is fly the thing into
my face, [laughter], um and I’ve
done that a number of times, so

00:00:16.917-->00:00:21.154
let's big, let’s give David a
big round of applause.
[Applause]. Good Luck. >> Thank

00:00:21.154-->00:00:27.394
you >> Have a good time >> Thank
you. Thank you. Well [Clears
throat]. I can say that I’m

00:00:27.394-->00:00:32.399
pretty iterate so let's get it
started. Well, welcome to my,
welcome to my talk, er glad to

00:00:35.702-->00:00:41.341
see you here er and I’m going to
present a project interceptor,
um oh it's uh it’s about owning

00:00:41.341-->00:00:46.346
anti-drone systems with
nanodrones. So, er, thats me,
er, well, I’m David Melendez, er

00:00:50.484-->00:00:55.489
and I sit on the embedded
software engineer er, in er
company in Spain and and I er,

00:01:01.261-->00:01:05.499
the creator, the actor of the
[indiscernible] robots and I
want to explain later. And er

00:01:05.499-->00:01:10.504
the author of the book Hacking
con drones, it’s in Spain, it’s
in Spanish and ah recently

00:01:12.839-->00:01:17.844
speaker but not here. And a
trainiac. Why, why, why are you
saying that I a traniac? This is

00:01:20.681-->00:01:25.686
a, this is the autobus espanol
it’s a pretty cool train, its
fast and it's cool and you’ll

00:01:30.624-->00:01:35.629
fast but, I’m pretty er, fond,
of er, your trains because they
are pretty bada**. They are

00:01:40.100-->00:01:45.105
stack containers [laughs] big
fun, big fun of you guys, big
fun of you folks, absolutely.

00:01:48.976-->00:01:53.981
So, you, you meet later with me
er, be careful, because I, I’m
maybe I start talking with

00:01:59.019-->00:02:03.957
trains and I cannot stop, so, be
careful. So, I will like to
start with um, with this,

00:02:05.859-->00:02:16.236
[laughs], you laughing [laughs],
brill, good job folk, [laughs]
I, I, I thinking about this guy

00:02:16.236-->00:02:26.046
living at home and er honey, I,
I’m, I’m doing a pretty good job
today [laughs], so thats thats a

00:02:26.046-->00:02:35.188
one point. The second point
previously in defcon, er, want
to start the, with drones in

00:02:35.188-->00:02:40.160
defcon. And I think that what is
the first drones seen in defcon
er, with pretty cool stuff and

00:02:40.160-->00:02:50.237
um with with hacking
capabilities, you, you can take
the drone along the city, er,

00:02:50.237-->00:02:59.479
taking a lot of networks um,
make some cooler stuff, right,
and the second one was the, the

00:02:59.479-->00:03:09.489
the year ago for the danger
drone, and er it is a pretty
cool stuff because er, it will

00:03:09.489-->00:03:20.067
use er, 3G and 4G erm,
communication and telemetrics,
so, er, that's because several

00:03:20.067-->00:03:28.075
er anti-drone systems works
indeed with 3G and 4G systems
and if you oos, use, the same

00:03:28.075-->00:03:34.614
system, um the anti-drones, they
can be ‘trol you. There’s,
there’s no way to jam your

00:03:34.614-->00:03:46.293
drone, but er, only because it’s
illegal to jam 3G, 4G erm,
frequencies, er, you can say

00:03:46.293-->00:03:56.636
some kind of er, problems. So I
want to explain drones as a
threat, I, I, I like this that

00:03:56.636-->00:04:06.646
picture, because it’s it’s
[laughs] pretty um, pretty cool.
Well, er we can I start er

00:04:06.646-->00:04:13.954
talking about drones as a flying
computers. It’s like er internet
of things over your head er,

00:04:13.954-->00:04:26.299
IoT, it’s, we can call iot us
before we return to, to us host,
because er, there were er, name

00:04:26.299-->00:04:34.374
Quadcopters, ok, you can use
custom payloads, sniffer
jammers, network analyzers, 3D

00:04:34.374-->00:04:40.313
mapping cameras and so on. Some
kind of cooler stuff you can,
you can put it in your drone, so

00:04:40.313-->00:04:47.554
er, any type of thing you, you
can imagine, you can put into
your drone. A drone is a, it’s a

00:04:47.554-->00:04:55.929
vehicle, it’s not a weapon, it's
not a it’s a bill its a tool,
alright. So, we, how we can

00:04:55.929-->00:05:05.071
detect er drones, well er the
first one is ok, I, I’m seeing a
drone ok. I detected it. So,

00:05:05.071-->00:05:17.217
there’s a, there are thermal and
extended cameras er, well,
[indiscernible] out of systems

00:05:17.217-->00:05:27.727
that er, they are able to detect
drones by its heat and, wait, er
artificial intelligence and so

00:05:27.727-->00:05:35.435
and er with thermal cameras with
electronics and motor heat
detection. Ok, you see four dots

00:05:35.435-->00:05:50.917
on the sky are are pretty hot.
It’s not a pigeon, I think. Mmm,
also othe, othe, detection

00:05:50.917-->00:05:57.157
method is a extension of drone
noise, er, a detection extension
[makes sound] “vvvrrrrr”, ok,

00:05:57.157-->00:06:03.096
we, we got it. The detector
radio frequency in white form,
this is the most important

00:06:03.096-->00:06:11.538
method to detect drones because
er every drone has a signal too
of radio communication and is

00:06:11.538-->00:06:20.080
pretty easy to detect that this,
those drones because for
example, ok, um and wifi with a

00:06:20.080-->00:06:31.858
access point, name er, put here
a manufactured drone, its much,
it must be a drone ok. Well,

00:06:31.858-->00:06:40.100
other, other methods to detect
drones I make pretty fun of
this, er voluntary measures.

00:06:40.100-->00:06:47.574
Well, if you install in your
drone an application that report
to cops that you are flying a

00:06:47.574-->00:06:55.448
drone in a certain area in a, at
a er certain time, ok, no
problem at all, everything will

00:06:55.448-->00:07:02.122
be alright, right? [laughs], er
so, this application gives to
cops the ability to take down

00:07:02.122-->00:07:07.260
your your drone, imani, imagine
if you install this application
in your car, ok, rethink where

00:07:07.260-->00:07:20.774
we are right. So, perfect plan,
so, how about the counter
countermeasures? Well, we can

00:07:20.774-->00:07:30.884
use uh several methods that they
are already on the stage they
are like the spread spectrum but

00:07:30.884-->00:07:40.360
in, you can transmit, in a, in a
very white er area of radio
frequency and er with the hope

00:07:40.360-->00:07:48.668
that nobody can gam on, on all
the area, for any hopping, you
can hop too many channels and

00:07:48.668-->00:07:55.475
use unexpected frequencies like
the jammer, the jammer expects
that the drones works in a

00:07:55.475-->00:08:07.721
certa, certain frequencies and
robot protocols that we are
talking about this. Well I want

00:08:07.721-->00:08:15.729
to explain my first er, my first
round of this stuff, that, it is
called Atropos it’s a Quadcopter

00:08:15.729-->00:08:23.503
that I build like 6 years ago,
you can google it, it is in
hackaday and so on and I decide

00:08:23.503-->00:08:34.714
to build er with a wifi router,
it’s a wifi router, an La Fonera
router and er, well some cooler

00:08:34.714-->00:08:43.857
stuff like er, wheel remote er
of nintendo, as an internal an
internal sensors. So 6 Years

00:08:43.857-->00:08:50.864
ago, there’s no chinese er
manufacturers that you can buy
and tay, take your sensor to

00:08:50.864-->00:08:59.606
your home, so, there was er
easier to take the sensor er
from, from the [indiscernible]

00:08:59.606-->00:09:09.816
and I decide to, to put the
sensors to the router directly
er, by attaching the, the, the

00:09:09.816-->00:09:20.527
bus to light, ok and er control
it by by a web server, er
installed on the router, there,

00:09:20.527-->00:09:28.301
there programmer distribution
program is programmed in in c
inside the router and it has a

00:09:28.301-->00:09:34.908
it has an embedded system. I’m
not sure er, some of the
capability with bully that it’s

00:09:34.908-->00:09:44.084
it’s able to attack other wi
wifi’s so you can see the, the
La Fonera router and some pretty

00:09:44.084-->00:09:58.364
cool and professional soldering
skills and that's perfect. I’m,
ah, num num num, so now what

00:09:58.364-->00:10:06.873
else. I like to see this movie
because er, well, well all the
star wars movies made me cry, so

00:10:06.873-->00:10:17.917
I like the, this one ok, and I
like practically in a scene um,
we count fifty rebel ships Lord

00:10:17.917-->00:10:23.456
Vader but they’re so small
they’re evading our turbo
blasters that makes er, that

00:10:23.456-->00:10:34.968
give me an idea why not make a
small drone, ok, with chopsticks
ok, because, people ask me why,

00:10:34.968-->00:10:42.509
why are you using chopsticks?
[laughs] Do, don’t you have a 3D
printer or somewhere, are you

00:10:42.509-->00:10:51.951
poor or, or, or what? Em, well
I, If I print the, he drone,
nobody believes me it’s mine.

00:10:51.951-->00:11:06.366
[laughs] So this is mine.
[laughter]. Erm, I’m going to
check that erm, actually the

00:11:06.366-->00:11:13.339
drone is draining the its
battery, so maybe I have to, to
fly before the battery

00:11:13.339-->00:11:25.485
drains.[laughs] Ok, alright. So
the brain interceptor is based
on low budget, now, seriously,

00:11:25.485-->00:11:34.427
low. You take er, um a cheap
sensor, a cheap er board and a
cheap everything. Minimum size

00:11:34.427-->00:11:44.470
and weight, harder to detect ok,
and with all the stuff that er,
that this on this thing, hacking

00:11:44.470-->00:11:54.447
capabilities and receding
control. Well, this is the the
drone and the chopsticks. We can

00:11:54.447-->00:12:03.323
see um, um a a Linux board
inside that is indeed a, a
router with open, OpenWRT line

00:12:03.323-->00:12:15.234
Linux er, distribution. Er,
inside er, and some cool stuff
so er, like, brushed motors, why

00:12:15.234-->00:12:24.377
use it, because they are cheap,
ridiculously cheap ok, and
small. So er, we have

00:12:24.377-->00:12:34.621
transistors and steer and camera
and so on, so you can, you can
compare with 1 euro coin ok, and

00:12:34.621-->00:12:42.562
this is the Vocore2 I think this
is small, this is the smallest
board on the market er, that

00:12:42.562-->00:12:57.076
this run Linux and we have WiFi
and er, ya, it, the spe, spi,
specifications and we have a cp

00:12:57.076-->00:13:06.419
one core of cpu and 3 serial
ports and the most important
thing is er, powell, uh PWM er

00:13:06.419-->00:13:15.795
ports, there is 4, there are 4
ports of pulls with modulation
ok, this, er, those ports are

00:13:15.795-->00:13:21.768
used to control the motors
without any other integrated
circuit just because, it have to

00:13:21.768-->00:13:29.409
be a small, it have to be cheap,
um we have to take advantage on
all the, all the hardware stuff

00:13:29.409-->00:13:37.183
ok. So, we need er 4 powell, er,
PWM signals to control the
motors, one for each one and

00:13:37.183-->00:13:45.558
they are uh hard real time
constrained. Uh, we cannot
emulate and or it is very

00:13:45.558-->00:13:52.965
difficult and uncomfortable to
emulate er, those signals er,
with the quality required, to

00:13:52.965-->00:14:02.208
er, to make the drone works. So,
we have 4 channels available,
we, but we only 2 enable by the

00:14:02.208-->00:14:08.347
manufacturer. We have 2 enable
the other, the other one but,
what, what happens when the,

00:14:08.347-->00:14:18.191
with the, the other 2? They are
the serial debug console. Good
job, right, ok. So we have to

00:14:18.191-->00:14:26.065
disable, to disable the er, the
serial port for debugging and
enable all the 4, pins. I went

00:14:26.065-->00:14:35.475
to the forum and the guy that
design the the code, er, is
answer all your questions and,

00:14:35.475-->00:14:44.383
one guy, I ask for to enable to
the, these pins and the guy
answer, well there’s a hard way.

00:14:44.383-->00:14:52.692
Well you have to download the
open, the Linux software from
vocore, second, find the DDS in

00:14:52.692-->00:14:57.897
short, try doing the try to
understand the pin control and
you have understand some kind of

00:14:57.897-->00:15:06.739
this stuff, and then you make
magic, ok. And you will be a
good Linux hacker [laughs] ok

00:15:06.739-->00:15:17.583
[laughs], what the f**k?
[laughter]. Thank you for
nothing [laughs] guy. Er, so,

00:15:17.583-->00:15:23.823
here you, you have the, all the
stuff that you need to, to
enable and disable, all the

00:15:23.823-->00:15:31.898
stuff. You have the UART er
pins, er, defined, you have the
pin marks, ok this is a maxer,

00:15:31.898-->00:15:40.039
uh, I interconnected er, inside
of the, of the, of the
sysinternal chip. You have to

00:15:40.039-->00:15:49.282
wire, er, functions, wire with
outputs, because er chip has
more fraction, more functions,

00:15:49.282-->00:15:55.555
than outputs and you are saying
a faction, a function to an
output. So, you have to, to

00:15:55.555-->00:16:10.336
reassign, disable the, the UART
and enable the er power with er
modulations. We have to redefine

00:16:10.336-->00:16:23.449
those pins, we call, I call
[indiscernible] pins. We have
the first one, the serial, the

00:16:23.449-->00:16:29.856
one, and they are already
defined, but I’m going to define
the, the other 2. But this code

00:16:29.856-->00:16:39.866
UART2 P PWM. The group is UART
but the function is powell, en,
PWM. Additionally in the I2C

00:16:39.866-->00:16:49.742
mass, I attach an er, a sensor
to, to take into account the
battery ok, we disable UART and

00:16:49.742-->00:16:57.617
we enable the, the 4 channels.
Well this is for, only for, for
your information from the data

00:16:57.617-->00:17:04.690
sheet, where, where I found the
information to change that. Well
the power stage is almost it

00:17:04.690-->00:17:14.333
that’s me in my work er
pretending to er, to know what
I’m doing. With an oscilloscope

00:17:14.333-->00:17:25.411
um, there is a, er, my my
personal version of electronic
speed control. Ok. This is the

00:17:25.411-->00:17:31.684
oscilloscope because er, with
brushed motors, we have to deal
with er, counter electromotive

00:17:31.684-->00:17:39.859
er force, because er, when the
motor is a spinning er, I have
to deal, I have to power it, but

00:17:39.859-->00:17:47.333
a motor act as also as a
generator. And put er current in
the circuit, a reverse current,

00:17:47.333-->00:17:56.075
so I have to cancel it with a
capacitor and a dial and a
circuit dial. This is the P the

00:17:56.075-->00:18:03.749
PID tunning this is the worst
part of build a drone, you have
to turn it from 0 0 0 ok. And,

00:18:03.749-->00:18:42.488
um, well. Er, I’m going to
explain, the WiFi Architecture
of this um, of this drone, that

00:18:42.488-->00:18:49.095
is not a WiFi regular drone
because er, it works er, as a
beacon frame based

00:18:49.095-->00:18:54.800
communication. That’s because if
you are not authenticated to any
network, you can not be the

00:18:54.800-->00:19:01.474
authenticated, ok. Nobody come
here to the authentication
attack and they’ll authenticate

00:19:01.474-->00:19:08.214
my drone. Because it’s not
authenticated to anything. Er,
we have a joystick, the joystick

00:19:08.214-->00:19:27.400
is not a fancy recei drone
remote. [muffled off-mic
talking]. And er, we have a um,

00:19:27.400-->00:19:36.375
a pilot side that this is my
laptop with an additional WiFi
adaptor. So, er my, pro my

00:19:36.375-->00:19:43.049
communication protocol is based
on beacons, beacon frames, so in
the payload those beacon frames

00:19:43.049-->00:19:54.493
er, travel er, all the data from
my remote, from my joystick and
to the BI Load and reverse. It

00:19:54.493-->00:20:00.599
will turn on your laptop from
wireless, you will see 2
Networks, one called interceptor

00:20:00.599-->00:20:08.441
and the other one call pileto or
pilot. Er, They are fake
networks ok. One network is er,

00:20:08.441-->00:20:15.948
generated by my laptop and the
other network is generated by
the drone. Er, both sides are

00:20:15.948-->00:20:26.959
designed, to, listen to east,
each other and erm, well, for
control and telemetry, as you,

00:20:26.959-->00:20:33.232
as you can see that on, on the
other slide. Er, protected with
a encryption algorithm, because

00:20:33.232-->00:20:43.976
if not, we are not doing nothing
[laughs]. So, this is the
packet, er packet format, and

00:20:43.976-->00:20:51.884
you can see all, all the stuff
of um the encryption, algorithm.
We have an a initialization

00:20:51.884-->00:21:01.460
vector, we have a common
sequence number and a integrity
check. So this, this is the er,

00:21:01.460-->00:21:31.490
this is the travel inside the
beacon frame. So, I would like,
um, we can turn on the drone. I

00:21:31.490-->00:22:10.029
will put er, on the ground for
my safety, not for yours
[laughter]. [Cheer]. [Laughter]

00:22:10.029-->00:22:20.839
[Drone flying, laughter, muffled
talking]. Maybe I’m going to
change the battery later. [Drone

00:22:20.839-->00:23:09.722
flying]. I have to change the
battery. I will try here.
[muffled speech]. Well, um,

00:23:09.722-->00:23:19.698
while it, it its starts again,
I’m going to explain er you um a
particular um, er, er

00:23:19.698-->00:23:25.771
characteristic of the, of this
protocol, but er, because erm,
its allowed me to change er the

00:23:25.771-->00:23:33.979
channels of the WiFi, of the
both WiFi’s, the drone and the
pilot er, while I’m flying it,

00:23:33.979-->00:23:45.758
without, without losing control,
er, that because, um, the WiFi’s
adaptors, er, they are no

00:23:45.758-->00:23:53.832
perfect. So, if you are on
channel one, you are listening
er, packets mmmm from channel 2

00:23:53.832-->00:24:01.540
for example. Er, this protocol
takes advantage of this.
Because, if you are, if I want

00:24:01.540-->00:24:08.414
to change the channel of the
drone to, from channel 1 to
channel 5. I turn it on, change

00:24:08.414-->00:24:16.255
to channel 2 ok. The drone
acknowledge that, ok and channel
2 change, dual changed to

00:24:16.255-->00:24:23.662
channel 2, so, both pilot and
drone are in the channel 2. So,
they in a loop changing

00:24:23.662-->00:24:33.238
channels, each other, until er,
they reach, all the er, to the
channel 5 or, or the target

00:24:33.238-->00:24:48.821
channel, that I set. This is the
interface er, well, this er,
some come of stuff of this er,

00:24:48.821-->00:24:55.828
work interface, the inter inter
interfacing is created on the
laptop. Er, the laptop receives

00:24:55.828-->00:25:02.434
the bee, the beacon frames,
they, they, they turn into web
circuit package and it’s er,

00:25:02.434-->00:25:24.056
seen er, on the, on the web
page. So. I want to show you a
video. This is the interface on

00:25:24.056-->00:25:35.701
the drone. And er, now the, the
networks on my house. [Clears
throat] The, the drone keeps

00:25:35.701-->00:25:43.776
updating the the networks but,
I, I can control the drone while
the drone is er, attacking the

00:25:43.776-->00:25:55.320
networks why with bully, ok. So,
there is so many er, networks
on, on here. I, I’m changing

00:25:55.320-->00:26:04.930
the, the channel of the drone,
while, you see. They it show on
our system they, they change of

00:26:04.930-->00:26:14.540
the, of the channel. You going
see, you can see that, here.
Here. Channel 8, both, ok. And

00:26:14.540-->00:26:21.447
they Chay and they change
seamlessly. I don’t, I don’t
lose the control. That because I

00:26:21.447-->00:26:27.920
don’t, I don’t want to put our
next eh apto, our next WiFi
adaptor, on the drone ok,

00:26:27.920-->00:26:38.730
because it's very expensive.
[laughs] It's er, er, an extra
weight to the drone er,

00:26:38.730-->00:27:55.140
especially. Ok. [Drone flying]
[Applause]. Are you safe [laugh,
audience comment] . Well, it so,

00:27:55.140-->00:28:16.461
it’s almost ok, ok. [Laughter] .
So, er, I’m not a very, a very
professional pilot indeed, but.

00:28:16.461-->00:28:42.020
Well, the other, the other
demonstration that I’m doing
with this is to prove that, any,

00:28:42.020-->00:28:47.726
anybody who, is able to build a
drone with a, a custom flight
controller like mine. This is

00:28:47.726-->00:28:56.001
all, all programmed on C, both
the distribution program er,
inside the, inside the recall

00:28:56.001-->00:29:08.580
and the protocol em, of
communication. It has um, I’m
working right now on a extra

00:29:08.580-->00:29:21.960
file doc communication system
based on er, er, SDL ok. Just,
just incase, er, every er, just

00:29:21.960-->00:29:29.468
in case, a pile, a, a drone
jammer detect my network,
because my network er, you can

00:29:29.468-->00:29:36.375
see as a pilot als has an
interceptor, but they can change
to, to be the same as the, as

00:29:36.375-->00:29:45.984
the, as the nearby networks, ok
that is er, to hide the, the
presence of the drone. So, er,

00:29:45.984-->00:29:56.995
another protocol is a, fibre
protocol based on on niefie, on
FM that is [indiscernible] and a

00:29:56.995-->00:30:06.438
radio frequency, inside the
range and er, start transmitting
if the pilot detects that no

00:30:06.438-->00:30:16.348
more telemetry comes from the
drone. There, that the link is
is broken. So, er, you have, it

00:30:16.348-->00:30:25.524
transmit to, with a radio
frequency, and the, the limit of
this, of this project is that

00:30:25.524-->00:30:31.897
transmitting illegal frequencies
are the less problem for bad
guys, if, if you are to, to do

00:30:31.897-->00:30:40.739
bad things. The less of your
problem is to transmit on FM ok.
So, er, this is a warning to, to

00:30:40.739-->00:30:48.947
drone manufacturers, because er,
I I still, keep er, sending
commands to the drone even,

00:30:48.947-->00:31:01.693
without WiFi, using a raspberry
pi radio transmission with a
RPTX er project ok. As proof of

00:31:01.693-->00:31:12.571
concept. So, er, I am selecting
the, the frequency dynamically,
so er, we, we survey the the

00:31:12.571-->00:31:18.844
spectrum and I take the, the
peaks and the valleys and then I
select the, the best suitable

00:31:18.844-->00:31:31.189
er, frequency. So, the fallback
FM base er communication, we
have a the joystick. They, they

00:31:31.189-->00:31:39.030
are limited to 4 bytes packet
and they are transmitted to F,
FSK modulation, using the mini,

00:31:39.030-->00:31:50.008
the mini, mini modem er project
and er, there are, they turn on,
into a Rev format, ok with our

00:31:50.008-->00:32:00.652
FM modulated transmission and
they are on air by Raspberry Pi.
So um, as the dongle on drone

00:32:00.652-->00:32:09.194
captures that frequency and
makes the reverse path ok, we
have a, an audio capture and I

00:32:09.194-->00:32:17.536
we have to demodul, demodulate
that eh, packet with er, the
same mini modem but compile with

00:32:17.536-->00:32:25.644
er for er, for er, architure of
the drone of this
[indiscernible] and we have erm,

00:32:25.644-->00:32:37.422
the 4 byte er format er, for
flight control, ok. Ok, this was
the demo. I you can see that I’m

00:32:37.422-->00:32:57.175
like Porkus [laughs] Ok. I would
like to, I would like to
explain, mm mm mmm, more, we

00:32:57.175-->00:33:06.418
have more time? I would like to
explain er, a little bit more er
what, what map do I follow to be

00:33:06.418-->00:33:14.659
tuning, because it's the hardest
part to, to make a drone. Er, I
attached to a, to a 6, 8 er vent

00:33:14.659-->00:33:26.705
professional grade. Er with also
chopsticks ok. And other part,
other home parts on the, you can

00:33:26.705-->00:33:36.982
see, so, you have to turn the P
that is the proportional gain.
It’s uh you you send uh we stay

00:33:36.982-->00:33:48.593
here. The drone it stay, it
stays here and I want to stay
straight the road is zero Its

00:33:48.593-->00:33:56.301
a, If if if it moves, the road
change, so we have to multiply
the road by the proportional

00:33:56.301-->00:34:03.842
gain ok. We have one force, the
second force is the integral er,
er, term, so I have to take into

00:34:03.842-->00:34:15.654
account, how much time is the is
the drone in another state, ok.
And the erm, relative term is it

00:34:15.654-->00:34:24.696
takes into account the speed
that I’m reaching, the the side
position ok. That, erm those er,

00:34:24.696-->00:35:07.939
values er we multiply with a
gain we have a real control of
the drone. Ok. So. Ok  This is

00:35:07.939-->00:35:47.278
my paper. Ok. I would like to
see you. So as conclusions. I
will like to show you the

00:35:47.278-->00:35:57.489
conclusions. Ok. We have a
regular small size weight and
cost. This bring us to the next

00:35:57.489-->00:36:05.163
point, how i’m hacking from
scratch er even, er you can’t
track that you buy a router er,

00:36:05.163-->00:36:14.939
cops can’t track that you are
building a drone for bad or for
good ok. So, er, we have a site,

00:36:14.939-->00:36:22.113
hidden channels, communications
as our central philosophy, no
vendor or 3G 4G communications.

00:36:22.113-->00:36:31.589
Erm, we keep the costs er, low
because we are using WiFi also,
but er, we have er, um,

00:36:31.589-->00:36:42.167
provisional capabilities to keep
the communications safe, or as
the safe as we can. Er, if an

00:36:42.167-->00:36:50.909
unexpected attack is performed,
or or all the Specs, or WiFi
Spectrum is er, is jammed, er,

00:36:50.909-->00:37:00.719
we have um, a fallback system,
to keep the, the drone control.
And we, we have er, people can

00:37:00.719-->00:37:08.493
can see us. We also have er
hacking capabilities, to erm,
hack another WiFi networks

00:37:08.493-->00:37:16.234
pentesting and so on, keeping on
only one er, adaptor on the
drone, ok, with the same

00:37:16.234-->00:37:24.275
adaptor. We have travel er,
throughout er, all the er, WiFi
channels. So er, under file

00:37:24.275-->00:37:37.522
control based on er, SDL
protocol. So. I will like to
thank you to say here and er,

00:37:37.522-->00:00:00.000
well if you have any questions,
so thank you very much.
[Applause]
