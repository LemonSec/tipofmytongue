00:00:00.133-->00:00:06.340
>>So this talk is about DefCon
groups. Uh we’re getting close
to the end. We’re in the- the

00:00:06.340-->00:00:10.310
final stretch of this DefCon.
Maybe you’re thinking to
yourself, “I would like this to

00:00:10.310-->00:00:14.815
continue in some form or
fashion.” That’s what they can
talk to you about because this

00:00:14.815-->00:00:19.820
the core group that runs- takes
care of DefCOn groups.
[applause] >>Thanks you three. I

00:00:24.925-->00:00:30.364
appreciate that. So DefCon
groups. So basically we’re going
to discuss what are DefCon

00:00:30.364-->00:00:34.701
groups, how can you get
involved, if there’s not a
DefCon group in your area how to

00:00:34.701-->00:00:41.208
start one, uh if you are already
involved in a DefCOn group yknow
some ideas as far as projects,

00:00:41.208-->00:00:46.213
meeting spaces, how to promote
your group and so on. So we’re
going to start off by

00:00:48.515-->00:00:53.186
introducing ourselves. We’re
basically the core team. We’re
the ones that in the background

00:00:53.186-->00:00:58.191
try to help DefCon groups grow
and uh just function from day to
day. Uh obviously the one and

00:01:00.360-->00:01:03.897
only Jeff Moss - we’re not sure
if he’s going to be able to
swing by or not - hopefully he

00:01:03.897-->00:01:08.902
is at some point. Uh and then
some guy named uh Jayson- uh
Str- Street? How - Jayson? What

00:01:13.106-->00:01:16.710
is it? >>It’s the guy taking
selfies with your phone- with
your cell phone right now. >>So

00:01:16.710-->00:01:21.048
I made the mistake of leaving my
uh phone on the table and I’m
surprised he hasn’t stolen my

00:01:21.048-->00:01:27.454
badge yet either so uh thanks
buddy. Uh next, myself, Brent
White. I’m the um the global

00:01:27.454-->00:01:34.027
coordinator. I try to think of
meaningful things to tell Jayson
to do so he can give me excuses

00:01:34.027-->00:01:39.833
as to why he shouldn’t do those.
Uh and then it basically gets
handed down to April Wright who

00:01:39.833-->00:01:45.439
uh anyone who sends an email
about “Hey we want to start a
group. Hey we need updates to

00:01:45.439-->00:01:52.412
our group” April will respond to
that and uh and send it on for
someone else to handle the

00:01:52.412-->00:01:57.417
things that she is not able,
which is zero. So uh we also
have Casey- Casey uh - Casey is

00:02:02.022-->00:02:08.295
also part of the registrar and
any updates and things. He’s,
he’s got some stuff to talk to

00:02:08.295-->00:02:14.501
you about soon. Darington, who
was unfortunately unable to make
the talk. Uh Darington is the

00:02:14.501-->00:02:19.373
one who actually makes the
changes to the websites and
several other things. Then we

00:02:19.373-->00:02:25.812
have Tim Roberts down at the
end, um, who also handles web
content. And then s0ups, who

00:02:25.812-->00:02:31.018
couldn’t make it this year who
also is our social media
manager. ANd so, that’s

00:02:31.018-->00:02:36.023
basically us. You’re DefCon
Groups core team. So. [applause]
Thank you. April, uh you want to

00:02:38.325-->00:02:43.330
take over this slide? Because
I’ve been talking enough. >>Hi.
>>Hi. >>Um, okay so starting a

00:02:57.477-->00:03:02.416
new group um, anybody can do it
if you have the uh interest in
meeting other hackers in your

00:03:04.951-->00:03:09.956
area um. My group is celebrating
our one year anniversary so
after last year we just- Thank

00:03:12.025-->00:03:16.563
you. We came home from DefCon
and decided to start a group and
uh within a couple months we

00:03:16.563-->00:03:21.268
were up and running and we’ve
been going ever since. So
there’s a great post - it’s

00:03:21.268-->00:03:26.239
great because I wrote it. Um
there’s a great post on the
website about how to starta

00:03:26.239-->00:03:30.911
DefCOn group. It goes through um
so you’re thinking about
starting a DefCon group. What do

00:03:30.911-->00:03:35.816
you need to think about? Um
looking at spaces. Trying to
find um trying to find other

00:03:35.816-->00:03:42.189
people. How to advertise. And
then finally how to send us uh
your submission to actually

00:03:42.189-->00:03:47.127
start your group and make it
official. Um one thing that
happens a lot is we get emails

00:03:47.127-->00:03:53.166
with uh submissions that we want
to start a group and are like we
want to be DefCon 42. Everybody

00:03:53.166-->00:03:59.906
wants to be DefCon 42. You can
not be DefCon 42. It’s based on
your calling code and your area

00:03:59.906-->00:04:05.579
code so it’s from the US. We’re
US centric so unfortunately um
so if you’re in another country

00:04:05.579-->00:04:11.585
it might be like one one uh
something something something.
So >>Just want to add too that

00:04:11.585-->00:04:18.291
no, your group name cannot be
double O 7. >>Or any binary.
>>Yeah. Boo. >>Boo >>That’s his

00:04:18.291-->00:04:23.296
fault. >>So um, so yeah there’s
some examples here. So in the US
and Canada and there’s this

00:04:25.665-->00:04:32.472
North American tele code thing
that dictates that we only have
to dial three digits so um in-

00:04:32.472-->00:04:37.477
in those areas you can have a
three digit name. If you are in
an area where- let’s say you’re

00:04:39.913-->00:04:44.084
in 6 1 7 like where I’m from and
somebody else wanted to start
another 6 1 7 group they would

00:04:44.084-->00:04:48.021
be 6 1 7 dash A. Or 6 1 7 dash
B. Or if there were more than
that. Um when there’s

00:04:48.021-->00:04:53.026
overlapping area codes you can
pick which one you want. Easy.
Casey? >>Thank you April. I

00:05:05.572-->00:05:12.412
guess summer camp is about
coming to an end so um just
quick show of hands. How many

00:05:12.412-->00:05:17.417
people in here are associated
with an active group? Okay
great. [applause] So I assume

00:05:21.254-->00:05:26.459
the rest of you are here because
perhaps you want to be
associated with an existing

00:05:26.459-->00:05:31.464
group. Is that correct?
[applause] Well one of the
things that we noticed uh when

00:05:33.733-->00:05:37.204
we first started working on this
is that we did have a lot of
inaccurate and outdated

00:05:37.204-->00:05:43.677
information so we’re starting an
initiative to verify all the
contact information that we have

00:05:43.677-->00:05:48.415
on our existing groups. So your
contract information, your
website information, the

00:05:48.415-->00:05:54.521
frequency you meet, where you
meet, the times that you meet,
uh areas of specialty et cetera.

00:05:54.521-->00:05:59.859
We need to get that updated so
people can find you and people
can find you accurately and

00:05:59.859-->00:06:04.798
efficiently. So through that
process any non-responsive
groups will be purged uh after a

00:06:07.133-->00:06:12.872
60 days period and uh then we’ll
start the process of trying to
get an active group in your area

00:06:12.872-->00:06:17.877
again so everyone can partake in
the fun of DefCon. Um we want to
ensure y’know your group remains

00:06:22.182-->00:06:27.187
active and uh- oops. Oh! Slides
went down! Um, we’ll also ensure
your group remains active and

00:06:31.558-->00:06:37.097
the other thing is we want to
promote uh y’know active
assistance and communication

00:06:37.097-->00:06:43.403
between groups too. That’s also
important for all the groups to
help each other. And y’know the

00:06:43.403-->00:06:49.643
very bottom thing, or the very
bottom line is that we- this
table up here in front of you-

00:06:49.643-->00:06:54.748
we’re here to help. We volunteer
for this because we want to be a
part of the community. We want

00:06:54.748-->00:07:00.954
to be any assistance to you guys
and uh help you in any way that
we can make your groups better.

00:07:00.954-->00:07:05.959
Uh so anyway thank you.
[applause] >>Don’t worry Casey,
I’ll do it. There you go. Oh

00:07:15.669-->00:07:20.674
yeah this was Darington’s slide
so I’ll cover it. So uh we’ve
actually um we’ve had some uh

00:07:22.876-->00:07:27.881
questions about how you can use
this smiley and the actual term
DefCon in your group names or

00:07:30.350-->00:07:35.355
promotional materials. So uh
just an FYI branding laws dp
apply here. Like you can’t just

00:07:37.457-->00:07:42.462
go and say “Hey we’re having a
DefCon meet up.” And Jayson can
clarify on this a little bit

00:07:46.032-->00:07:52.305
too, but you have to actually
specify it is your group and
it’s not DefCon like just

00:07:52.305-->00:07:57.844
DefCon. There is a y’know a
separation between actual DefCon
conference and then your local

00:07:57.844-->00:08:03.717
groups so that is very important
to keep in mind. If you do use
the Skully logo- if your not

00:08:03.717-->00:08:08.755
familiar with what Skully is-
it’s the bright green thing at
the bottom of the screen. Uh, if

00:08:08.755-->00:08:13.326
you do use that in your logo,
you do need to have the
registered trademark sign on

00:08:13.326-->00:08:20.033
that just to show that it is
registered and it’s not your
own. Um if you’ll notice on

00:08:20.033-->00:08:25.472
quite a few groups when they
create their logos they will
modify that in a certain way so

00:08:25.472-->00:08:30.477
because I’m short I’ll step over
here. Look at my shirt. It’s
slightly like skewed a little

00:08:33.580-->00:08:38.585
bit but we still just for the
sake of law we still uh try to
abide by those rules. But if you

00:08:41.621-->00:08:47.427
are going to use it without any
modification uh registered
trademark sign please. Uh if you

00:08:47.427-->00:08:54.067
do have a question If you’re not
really sure where those uh those
thin lines are. Y’know it’s

00:08:54.067-->00:08:59.272
fuzzy between legal not legal
copyright issues things. Just
shoot us an email. We’ll y’know

00:08:59.272-->00:09:04.110
clarify that for you. Let you
know if the design that you
currently have is cool or y’know

00:09:04.110-->00:09:11.017
suggestions on modifying that.
Uh but just make sure you check
fir- uh check with us please. Um

00:09:11.017-->00:09:16.256
as- as I mentioned already it’s
very important to make the
distinction between your DefCOn

00:09:16.256-->00:09:21.261
group meet up as opposed to the
actual DefCon conference. So.
Alright. Who’s up on this one?

00:09:27.267-->00:09:34.240
We’ve rehearsed several times
so. Alright Tim Roberts.
[applause] >>Hello everybody. So

00:09:34.240-->00:09:39.245
just to touch on something that
was already said. Everybody
raise your hand if you currently

00:09:42.449-->00:09:48.955
lead a DefCOn group. One two. So
look around- everybody keep your
hands up. Look around at each

00:09:48.955-->00:09:53.126
other. So something we want to
encourage too is to have
leaders, like some of the people

00:09:53.126-->00:09:57.730
that are leading these groups,
uh when you’re- you’re- be
creative. Get with each other

00:09:57.730-->00:10:01.000
and network with each other
because one of the logos if you
look with the DefCon groups it

00:10:01.000-->00:10:05.004
has uh a map and it has
everything- these beacons
touching. ANd that’s one of the

00:10:05.004-->00:10:09.075
things we want to encourage too
is to just help collaborate with
some of the creative ideas. Hey,

00:10:09.075-->00:10:13.813
here’s what our group’s doing.
Our group may just be coming up
with retro pies or something as

00:10:13.813-->00:10:18.084
simple as that and some other
things you may be developing
some zero days. Who knows?

00:10:18.084-->00:10:21.688
Whatever you’re doing just uh
try to reach out to each other.
Help encourage each other. Say

00:10:21.688-->00:10:25.992
“Hey here’s what our group’s
doing.” Um as far as uh this
slide. Email and requests

00:10:25.992-->00:10:32.065
handled and processed by a team
of volunteers. Who handles the
exact emails? >>April.

00:10:32.065-->00:10:37.003
>>Everybody? So April primarily
does the emails. >>April’s our-
our- the biggest adult in the

00:10:37.003-->00:10:42.008
group so she’s our adult
supervision so. >>ALright. The
backbone. No auto replies.

00:10:44.410-->00:10:49.482
You’re not going to get an auto
reply. Uh we do not. Let’s see
we do not open. Yeah don’t

00:10:49.482-->00:10:52.986
attach anything. So if you
attach a logo- say “Hey here’s
our new logo” and stuff like

00:10:52.986-->00:10:57.557
that. Don’t expect us to open
it. Um unless you’ve got some
embedded pdf or something. So um

00:10:57.557-->00:11:00.860
but be clear in your
communication when you’re
sending these email requests

00:11:00.860-->00:11:06.833
too. Some of the requests can be
very unclear. Y’know it- be a
little descriptive too. Uh one

00:11:06.833-->00:11:10.937
of the- I know one of the
sections uh in the submission
form talks about what you’re

00:11:10.937-->00:11:14.674
doing. What’s your goals and-
and kind of what you’re working
on. So be a little descriptive

00:11:14.674-->00:11:19.679
so people that are looking for
DefCon groups uh may be a little
more interested. Um instead of

00:11:19.679-->00:11:24.684
uh just being too vague. But
that’s all I got. >>Push the
button. [indiscernible] >>I

00:11:28.254-->00:11:33.259
think that’s the last slide.
>>Hold on just a sec. So. Hello
everyone. How’s it going? Can-

00:11:36.729-->00:11:43.136
Can we start of with e-everybody
that says that their a ra- uh
leader raise your hand. K. All

00:11:43.136-->00:11:47.941
you guys come up front real
quick. Tr- I’m not going to hug
you. Don’t worry. Okay?

00:11:47.941-->00:11:52.946
[laughter] >>I’m not coming up
if you don’t. >>Okay well then
I’ll give you a hug then. Here.

00:11:55.848-->00:12:00.787
Aww. [applause] We got a special
DCG challenge. You can’t come
back up now saying “Oh I’m a

00:12:04.490-->00:12:08.561
leader” but we’re going to be
giving out coins for uh- oh I
know your a DefCon group leader.

00:12:08.561-->00:12:13.099
>>[indiscernible] >>How’s it
going. Uh so these are some uh
DCG coins. We’re going to give

00:12:13.099-->00:12:18.571
some out more for some other
questions but these are for uh
the DCG POCs. Uh some challenge

00:12:18.571-->00:12:22.709
coins. Uh and we’re going to do
a Q and A but the fact the way
that we’re doing the closing

00:12:22.709-->00:12:27.380
we’re going to try and do it a
little more Q and A like live.
Uh and I want to start off with-

00:12:27.380-->00:12:32.385
you’ve heard a lot of stuff
about organization and the
minutiae and things like- I’m

00:12:34.821-->00:12:39.826
not part of any of that. So uh
I’m gonna ask you about why. Why
do you want to be in a DefCon

00:12:42.195-->00:12:48.968
group. What does a DefCon group
about? What does it entail? Wh-
What is it for? ANd basically

00:12:48.968-->00:12:54.440
this key thing that we want to
talk about is a DefCon group is
a way for you to connect locally

00:12:54.440-->00:12:59.445
uh with uh local hackers that
share the interest with you. Uh
DefCon is a global community and

00:13:02.382-->00:13:08.721
I mean like global. Like I’ve
been to con- conferences and
other groups all over the world

00:13:08.721-->00:13:14.193
uh meeting passionate hackers
that are also communicating and
not just having this feeling

00:13:14.193-->00:13:19.799
once a year but 24 7 because
they’re able to talk to people
in their own city about their

00:13:19.799-->00:13:23.703
interests. About what they’re
doing. And that’s what we want
to encourage. We want you to

00:13:23.703-->00:13:30.043
meet with local hackers. It’s
like just like with DefCon here
uh you got the villages. So if

00:13:30.043-->00:13:33.379
you like wireless. You just-
you’re just hanging out in the
wireless village and you’ve got

00:13:33.379-->00:13:36.616
all those people with the same
kind of passion. Lock pick
village. AI village. Biohacking

00:13:36.616-->00:13:41.587
village. Social engineering
village. ALl these different
villages with these interests

00:13:41.587-->00:13:47.126
that you have. And I keep
telling people- it’s like 25000
people a day at DefCon. That’s

00:13:47.126-->00:13:53.066
25000 opportunities to find
someone that ha- shares your
interests. With the DefCon group

00:13:53.066-->00:13:57.503
that even narrows the odds down
even better in your favor so you
can actually connect with

00:13:57.503-->00:14:02.208
someone locally. That’s why you
have a DefCon group. It’s like
you see all these DefCon un

00:14:02.208-->00:14:08.614
badges. It’s like badge life.
Hashtag badge life. Uh and a lot
of those are from DefCon groups

00:14:08.614-->00:14:12.852
that are like started out and
wanted to do their own badge and
like their learning soldering.

00:14:12.852-->00:14:17.490
They’re learning how to make uh
PCB boards and how to program
and how to make those blinky

00:14:17.490-->00:14:22.328
lights do the blinky things that
they do. And that’s awesome and
amazing. But they’re also

00:14:22.328-->00:14:25.732
learning and giving classes.
It’s like I know of DefCOn
groups that are going into

00:14:25.732-->00:14:31.904
schools and teaching uh children
uh about online safety. I know
others that are working with uh

00:14:31.904-->00:14:36.109
non profits in different parts
of the world. There’s one
especially in China that’s doing

00:14:36.109-->00:14:40.680
this that’s working with non
profits and actually going in
and helping with equipment to

00:14:40.680-->00:14:45.218
local area schools that don’t
have that much uh internet
connectivity at all. It’s like

00:14:45.218-->00:14:49.222
so I mean there’s a lot of
things that you can do with your
DefCon group. It’s not just a

00:14:49.222-->00:14:53.392
pub meet up. Which there’s a lot
of DefCon groups that are like
that, which is awesome. So it’s

00:14:53.392-->00:14:57.864
like uh but you’re giving
presentations. You have- you
want to give a presentation at

00:14:57.864-->00:15:01.768
DefCOn, which I hope you do
because you should. It’s like-
but you don’t want to do it

00:15:01.768-->00:15:08.074
right off the bat. Go to a local
DefCon group and give that talk.
Get constructive criticism. Hear

00:15:08.074-->00:15:12.411
from your peers. Get heckled and
learn how that works too because
I had to learn that the hard way

00:15:12.411-->00:15:17.383
as well. It’s like and find out
what it’s about. So that’s what
DefCOn group is for and it’s for

00:15:17.383-->00:15:21.587
everybody. So we’re gonna open
up for questions before I keep
rambling uh and we want some

00:15:21.587-->00:15:26.893
questions and answers of what
you think you have if your
wanting to start a new DefCOn

00:15:26.893-->00:15:31.664
group. If you’re uh already have
one or if you want uh some
clarification of what we’ve

00:15:31.664-->00:15:35.802
talked about Let’s open it up
for question and answer period.
Uh, yes. >>[indiscernible

00:15:35.802-->00:15:42.742
question from audience] >>Yes.
Alright, so the question was
“What’s- for spacing. It’s like

00:15:42.742-->00:15:47.747
where do you want to have these
uh the DefCon group meet up.
Where could it be or what’s a

00:15:52.618-->00:15:57.623
good space for it.” Uh that’s a
very varied answer because
there’s a lot of uh um places

00:16:01.561-->00:16:06.365
where you could be. I know some
like the DCG4440 usually um meet
at a pub or a restaurant uh

00:16:06.365-->00:16:11.470
where they still have the talk.
So there’s a lot of DefCOn
groups that have um, uh an

00:16:11.470-->00:16:16.876
organization like they’ll get a
restaurant or get some kind of
uh hotel lobby uh uh breakfast

00:16:16.876-->00:16:22.949
area where they can use the
thing. Uh I believe April DC617
meets in an actual uh

00:16:22.949-->00:16:26.519
information security companies.
>>We’re in like a co-working
space. >>Okay so co-working

00:16:26.519-->00:16:32.358
space. >>And it’s- like we’ve
met in like the conference room
of a company that somebody

00:16:32.358-->00:16:36.562
worked for. Um it’s just
whatever’s available. Some
people meet in the food court.

00:16:36.562-->00:16:43.302
Um I’ve heard of other people
that meet in like uh dance clubs
but like during the day when

00:16:43.302-->00:16:47.773
they’re not in use so it’s just
like an empty space that they’re
not doing anything with so.

00:16:47.773-->00:16:54.680
>>Colleges. >>Yeah colleges are
awesome. They’re usually willing
to donate space for free. >>One

00:16:54.680-->00:16:59.218
of the things you can do too is
if you are at a university. I
know when I was in college I

00:16:59.218-->00:17:03.456
just started up a group, just a
club, and from there you’re
allowed to reserve space so you

00:17:03.456-->00:17:07.793
can reserve some of the lab
space even oftentimes if you’re
a registered club at a

00:17:07.793-->00:17:12.698
university so you could even
merge your DefCon group in with
that or uh get affiliated with

00:17:12.698-->00:17:19.538
one that creates spaces. >>Yeah.
Makerspaces are another good
spot because they- they love

00:17:19.538-->00:17:24.543
stuff like that. I mean yeah the
possibilities are endless and
when you sell it as uh as not a

00:17:27.346-->00:17:32.285
bunch of criminals trying to
break things and you say you
know we- we’re trying to learn.

00:17:32.285-->00:17:37.290
Make the world safer. And you
put it out there in a way that
is positive and especially if

00:17:39.458-->00:17:43.362
it’s a membership type of
organization and you offer free-
I mean it’s going to be free

00:17:43.362-->00:17:48.301
anyway but you offer that it’s
open to the public and that
anybody can show up from any

00:17:48.301-->00:17:53.839
group that already uses that
space. There’s community
centers, libraries, I mean I

00:17:53.839-->00:17:57.510
know that’s kind of lame or
whatever but like y’know the
possibilities are endless

00:17:57.510-->00:18:02.448
there’s all kinds of different
spaces. >>Can we get Mic Two on?
>>Okay so the current leaders

00:18:04.684-->00:18:09.322
over here uh just asked like so
where do you guys meet? Had
quite a few answers and one of

00:18:09.322-->00:18:15.895
the really cool ones was um a
front like Hackerspaces which is
really cool. Uh yeah go ahead

00:18:15.895-->00:18:20.566
and you want to introduce
yourself. >>Yeah I’m Peter. I
coordinate the DefCon group in

00:18:20.566-->00:18:26.205
Shin Jin, China. And actually
with Jayson’s help on his kind
of ambassador trip to China we

00:18:26.205-->00:18:31.010
connected with a local uh
Makerspace as they’re called in
Shin Jin. Uh and they’ve hosted

00:18:31.010-->00:18:35.781
us pretty much all our meetings.
And so we also use their
advertising network which gets

00:18:35.781-->00:18:40.653
us a lot of uh people involved
in the maker community in Shin
Jin. So we have a lot of people.

00:18:40.653-->00:18:44.557
So that network also helps us
connect with uh potential
members. >>Very cool. Alright

00:18:44.557-->00:18:49.595
thank you. And then uh you- you
had- you had said the
[indiscernible] Oh the

00:18:49.595-->00:18:54.066
universities were good. Okay.
Sorry I don’t pay attention very
well. Sorry. >>So who’s got

00:18:54.066-->00:18:59.071
another question. Yes sir.
>>[indiscernible question from
audience] >>Ireland. Very cool.

00:19:04.010-->00:19:11.017
Okay so they’re asking uh for
international groups. How do you
see if there’s actually one in

00:19:11.017-->00:19:14.920
your area. Uh actually on the
DefCon groups dot org website
there’s all the list of all the

00:19:14.920-->00:19:19.058
groups. It’s like so you can go
there and see if there’s one in
your area and once again I

00:19:19.058-->00:19:31.604
always end this caveat with “and
if there’s not, start one.” Ah
yes. >>[indiscernible question

00:19:31.604-->00:19:35.741
from audience] >>Hey can you-
>>Come over here and get on the
mic. >>Cuz after like four words

00:19:35.741-->00:19:39.979
in I forgot what you started to
say. I couldn’t repeat it. >>So
uh, I run DC562 out of LA. We’ve

00:19:39.979-->00:19:43.749
been around for about five years
uh. We’re lucky enough to have a
private space which helps us a

00:19:43.749-->00:19:49.789
lot. Uh when you do use things
like a school or a business they
will influence what you can or

00:19:49.789-->00:19:54.627
cannot talk about. You may also
be subject to search upon
arrival. Uh so keep that in mind

00:19:54.627-->00:19:57.797
when you try to align with these
different places that you may be
putting yourself at a disservice

00:19:57.797-->00:20:02.768
by using these public location.
Um but again we don’t all have
the ability to get that private

00:20:02.768-->00:20:11.277
space. It does take some time.
>>Any other questions? I have a
habit that- okay good. I was

00:20:11.277-->00:20:14.447
going to say I have a habit of
if no one asks questions I
usually run into the audience

00:20:14.447-->00:20:19.618
and then I make them ask me a
question. So if you don’t want
to be that guy or gal, uh, have

00:20:19.618-->00:20:27.760
a question. Yes, sir.
>>[indiscernible question from
audience] >>Um merging with- uh

00:20:27.760-->00:20:33.632
you said is there an effort to
merge with 2600 meetings?
>>Yeah. [indiscernible] >>Yeah

00:20:33.632-->00:20:37.770
y’know I’ve had this a lot and
especially with like- within
Europe like in Germany there’s a

00:20:37.770-->00:20:43.476
CCC group and then there’s other
other locations and other groups
in uh other region where it’s

00:20:43.476-->00:20:48.147
like well, I don’t know if I can
do a DefCon group because we
already have this group and I’m

00:20:48.147-->00:20:55.721
like, when is one ever enough?
Uh so um DefCon group is not
trying to supercede any other

00:20:55.721-->00:21:03.596
hacking group or local meet up.
It’s not trying to replace 2600
or CCC meet up uh or a Aha group

00:21:03.596-->00:21:08.134
or a Haha group. It’s like it’s
not trying- or a nisec it’s not
trying to replace those meetings

00:21:08.134-->00:21:13.906
but it can enhance it. Maybe one
is more social. Like 2600 for me
is always my experience with

00:21:13.906-->00:21:18.410
them has always been more
socially active. With DefCon
groups you can actually do

00:21:18.410-->00:21:22.448
presentations and you can do
projects and you can do building
and things. More creative

00:21:22.448-->00:21:26.685
moments and so uh 2600 groups
have that as well but it’s more
social so uh it could be a

00:21:26.685-->00:21:33.726
seperate group that sep- another
time of the week or the month to
actually meet up. Uh but if you

00:21:33.726-->00:21:39.131
wanted to say “hey, let’s meet
the first Friday of every month”
and just combine the two there’s

00:21:39.131-->00:21:42.902
nothing wrong with that either.
There’s nothing- there’s no
competition. So it’s how you

00:21:42.902-->00:21:48.040
want to make it and you should
make the group that fits in your
area. It’s like there no one

00:21:48.040-->00:21:51.777
right way uh just like when your
hacking something there’s no one
right way to do something. It’s

00:21:51.777-->00:21:57.583
like you find what works for you
and then you go with it. >>There
may be >>Something that I kind

00:21:57.583-->00:22:02.087
of want to interject 0on that
too. So uh like in Nashville we
have quite a few tech meetups so

00:22:02.087-->00:22:06.725
when we started the DefCon
groups we were very careful to
not step on the toes of like

00:22:06.725-->00:22:12.731
Freaknik or 2600 or other things
because that’s not the point. As
Jayson said so we were really

00:22:12.731-->00:22:16.969
careful with planning with that.
So it might be something to
consider uh and something else

00:22:16.969-->00:22:21.340
we’re currently working on too
which if you guys have any
questions about that we’ll be

00:22:21.340-->00:22:26.612
around after. I know uh between
Nashville, Knoxville, and
Chattanooga we’re currently uh

00:22:26.612-->00:22:31.083
in the talks of doing like a big
barbeque together meeting
somewhere and just kind of

00:22:31.083-->00:22:35.988
getting together you know kind
of keep the whole DefCon spirit
kind of going even after DefCon

00:22:35.988-->00:22:45.397
so um. >>Hey. So I’m Madhat I’m
from DFW. I started the DC214 in
2002. It’s one of the longer

00:22:45.397-->00:22:53.672
running DC groups. Um what we’ve
done in the DFW area- if you
don’t know anything about DFW-

00:22:53.672-->00:22:57.977
to get from one side to the
other is an hour, hour and a
half so there are actually

00:22:57.977-->00:23:04.250
between DC214, there’s a Dallas
hackers, there’s a Hackers Fort
Worth, there’s Nortex

00:23:04.250-->00:23:10.789
Cybersecurity group and at the
beginning of all the meeting we
promote the other groups. The

00:23:10.789-->00:23:15.394
whole idea is trying to get
people to go. And we have them
at different locations because a

00:23:15.394-->00:23:20.466
lot of people will live an hour
and a half away and they want to
be involved and there are a few

00:23:20.466-->00:23:24.270
people who will make two or
three meetings and it’ll cross
pollinate and the information

00:23:24.270-->00:23:30.242
gets around. It’s like this is-
the point of this is to get
people together of like minds to

00:23:30.242-->00:23:36.849
be able to feed off of each
other, to network. I mean I
can’t even begin to tell you the

00:23:36.849-->00:23:42.021
number of people that has gotten
jobs by attend DC214. I know
I’ve got two or three myself. Um

00:23:42.021-->00:23:48.093
it is a great networking
opportunity that you can start
up and join in on the other

00:23:48.093-->00:23:52.431
groups. You can start off with
another one and then split off
if you have to. There’s actually

00:23:52.431-->00:23:56.769
a calendar- a Google calendar
that we maintain to make sure
that we’re not stepping on each

00:23:56.769-->00:24:01.006
other’s toes so we have a
complete list of when all the
different events happen and you

00:24:01.006-->00:24:06.078
can go to one spot and find it
so I mean it’s a collaborative
effort. >>And- and as DefCon

00:24:06.078-->00:24:11.417
group global ambassador I’m not
allowed to take partiality or
anything, but DC214 was the

00:24:11.417-->00:24:16.488
first DefCOn group I called uh
home and I drove three hours to
get to it uh because there’s

00:24:16.488-->00:24:21.060
such an open and inviting place
so if you’re in the Dallas area
it’s like definitely uh meet up

00:24:21.060-->00:24:28.867
with the DC214 crew. Uh so good
job. >>Also uh if it’s your jam
um one of the things we do at

00:24:28.867-->00:24:34.940
DC859 is we work with uh
Kentucky Law Institute and from
that some of the law enforcement

00:24:34.940-->00:24:41.180
agencies have reached out to us
as trusted advisors and also ask
us questions and had me and a

00:24:41.180-->00:24:46.752
few other people from DC859 come
out and speak uh for security
awareness talks and things like

00:24:46.752-->00:24:51.023
that so that’s also another good
outlet. Because with that
they’ll also support and lean on

00:24:51.023-->00:24:56.328
you as trusted advisors. Um >>Um
that brings up a good point.
Everyone is welcome at a DefCon

00:24:56.328-->00:25:02.167
group. It’s like law
enforcement, feds, it’s like let
them- make sure- it’s like

00:25:02.167-->00:25:05.804
they’re not- they shouldn’t be
outed there so you shouldn’t be
making them feel uncomfortable.

00:25:05.804-->00:25:08.540
It’s like you should be working
with them showing them this is
what we do this is what it’s

00:25:08.540-->00:25:12.611
about. Communication is open.
Also the more feds that you
friend at the local DC groups,

00:25:12.611-->00:25:16.749
the easier chances of spotting
the fed at DefCon and getting a
shirt so keep that in mind,

00:25:16.749-->00:25:25.724
okay? It’s like so- so work with
them. It’s like, I mean, 360
y’know days a week- uh a month I

00:25:25.724-->00:25:30.429
mean- make sure you’re talking
to them, you’re working them,
collaborating with them but then

00:25:30.429-->00:25:35.601
at DefCon say “Hey, I know that
guy’s a fed.” I’m looking at
you, Tony. But um, so yeah you

00:25:35.601-->00:25:41.874
work with that and that’s how-
well retired. So collaborate
with local law enforcement.

00:25:41.874-->00:25:46.278
You’re not doing anything bad.
You shouldn’t be doing anything
bad so uh make sure you have

00:25:46.278-->00:25:49.415
that. Make sure you have that
rapport and they know exactly
what’s going on. Cuz I’ve seen

00:25:49.415-->00:25:53.352
groups that have gotten in
trouble because they wanted to
be y’know mysterious. I put on

00:25:53.352-->00:25:58.924
my robe and wizard hat and I’m
doing arcane things over here
and it causes problems. So make

00:25:58.924-->00:26:02.428
sure you’re open and you
communicating and you’re part of
the community because it’s not

00:26:02.428-->00:26:05.397
like you’re just part of the
hacker community. You’re in your
local community as well and you

00:26:05.397-->00:26:12.070
should be trying to impact them
there too. I see a question in
the back. >>So this isn’t

00:26:12.070-->00:26:16.175
actually a question. I’m not the
POC for DC402 but I’m the only
one here in this talk so here I

00:26:16.175-->00:26:22.147
am. Um we actually partner with
StrapCom in Omaha Nebraska and
I’ve actually had full uniformed

00:26:22.147-->00:26:26.685
colonels come up and send their
people to our meetings. >>Nice.
>>Just by outreaching to other-

00:26:26.685-->00:26:31.824
other unique hacking groups. So
just like you were saying, you
always want to reach out and uh

00:26:31.824-->00:26:36.895
and talk to the feds, so to
speak and have them trust you.
We also have ties to Impra Guard

00:26:36.895-->00:26:43.735
and a lot of other uh local
groups like that all attend our
meetings. >>Very good. Awesome.

00:26:43.735-->00:26:47.806
So- so- so it can be a working
collaboration. Also one of the
things that we need to know- you

00:26:47.806-->00:26:53.011
need to make sure- when you’re
doing these DefCon groups uh
sometimes uh they’re in places

00:26:53.011-->00:26:58.917
where there might be cost
incurred. It’s like I know DC801
uh a lot of their groups

00:26:58.917-->00:27:03.689
sometimes they’ll do dues or
like- they’ve got their own
space. It’s an amazing space at

00:27:03.689-->00:27:07.759
the DC801 and that’s why you
have such awesome parties and
they do kickstarters and there’s

00:27:07.759-->00:27:11.597
some that are charities but for
a DefCon group it’s like, if
you’re having an open public

00:27:11.597-->00:27:18.937
DefCon group you cannot charge
money for people to show up.
It’s like- it’s like you may be

00:27:18.937-->00:27:25.344
able to get sponsors and have
sponsors and like it’s vendor
neutral. They’re not trying to

00:27:25.344-->00:27:28.347
like advertise in their group.
They just say hey thanks for
giving a shout out but you

00:27:28.347-->00:27:32.217
cannot charge for a DefCon
group. We’ve had problems in the
past where people wanted to say

00:27:32.217-->00:27:36.788
come to our- we’ve created a
DefCon group and now we- we’re
going to have our DefCon group

00:27:36.788-->00:27:41.827
meeting and they’re charging a
price to cover cost. You can’t
do that. It’s like this is free

00:27:41.827-->00:27:51.003
and open to everyone. Should be
available and able to come in.
Uh, yes. >>[indiscernible

00:27:51.003-->00:27:58.176
question from audience] >>That
is a good question. He was
asking like uh uh the DC414 and

00:27:58.176-->00:28:03.348
Milwaukee actually meets once a
month and um he wants to know
what the meeting schedules are

00:28:03.348-->00:28:07.853
for some of the other groups
because I know of one that meets
once a quarter and another one

00:28:07.853-->00:28:13.258
that meets like twice a month so
there’s different uh different
uh times for meetings. What-

00:28:13.258-->00:28:17.563
What’s your schedule usually?
>>Does anybody actually meet
more than once a month with your

00:28:17.563-->00:28:22.634
DefCon group? A couple- >>We’ve
got some right over here. >>So
I’m starting to hear some that

00:28:22.634-->00:28:27.172
meet every other week. Is that
what you guys do? Every other
week? Or just once a week. Once-

00:28:27.172-->00:28:38.350
>>So one’s like- twice a month.
One’s like a presentation and
the other ones casual? >>Yeah.

00:28:38.350-->00:28:50.495
>>Okay. >>That’s cool. Um did
you guys want to answer.
>>What’s up? I’m Rando. I run um

00:28:50.495-->00:28:57.603
DC610 out of Eastern
Pennsylvania. We run once a
month um but the important thing

00:28:57.603-->00:29:02.641
to really realize about this is
you’re projects that you do in
your DefCon groups um they run

00:29:02.641-->00:29:08.280
all the time so I highly
recommend like getting a Slack
channel together. Getting an IRC

00:29:08.280-->00:29:14.286
or whatever your mode of
communication is so right now
like we’re planning a bar crawl

00:29:14.286-->00:29:19.091
CTF right? And it’s going to
happen like towards the end of
uh the fall or whatever. So make

00:29:19.091-->00:29:23.195
sure that those constant
communication channels are open
so even if you only meet once a

00:29:23.195-->00:29:28.533
month. I know the one in Philly
just started up DC215, um they
only meet once every couple of

00:29:28.533-->00:29:31.903
months but if you’re always
talking to each other and you’re
always communicating when you

00:29:31.903-->00:29:36.041
have these projects going and
you make your project plans and
stuff. That’s going to make your

00:29:36.041-->00:29:40.779
group a whole hell of a lot
stronger so you’re not going-
and those four weeks- if you go

00:29:40.779-->00:29:47.052
monthly- they go fast. And I
realized I haven’t done anything
and my guys are busy to so if

00:29:47.052-->00:29:51.890
you have those open channels
it’s super supercritical to get
a really great group going. >>I

00:29:51.890-->00:29:57.095
remember the DC214 having old
Silk IRC channels it’s like so
yeah constant communication is

00:29:57.095-->00:30:04.202
key. >>Yeah I’m with DC423 and
we normally meet uh once a month
for our primary presentation

00:30:04.202-->00:30:11.643
sessions and what not but we
also get together two to three
times a month for um our CTF

00:30:11.643-->00:30:20.118
team to work on either active um
competitions or just to come up
with other CTF ideas that we

00:30:20.118-->00:30:26.291
want to build for um any other
meetups that we get with. >>Uh I
have a quick questions. How many

00:30:26.291-->00:30:32.097
people here want uh the rest of
the world to know what’s going
on in their DefCon group? Who

00:30:32.097-->00:30:36.868
wants to actually inform
everybody else and the other
hackers in the community it’s

00:30:36.868-->00:30:41.373
like “hey, this is what we’re
doing that’s pretty cool.” We’re
looking for that. It’s like if

00:30:41.373-->00:30:45.811
you’ve noticed like I- when I
travel I always try to find the
local DefCon group POC and

00:30:45.811-->00:30:50.849
interview him or her and talk to
them about it and I’ve got some
of their interviews already up

00:30:50.849-->00:30:57.155
on DefCongroups dot org but I’m
only one guy and yes, I travel a
lot but not enough to get to

00:30:57.155-->00:31:03.595
everybody. So start submitting
your- uploading your own
interviews. Conduct your own

00:31:03.595-->00:31:07.699
interviews. Upload them to
youtube and send us the
information so we can actually

00:31:07.699-->00:31:13.105
post you up on the DefCon groups
website as well so everybody can
start understanding what’s going

00:31:13.105-->00:31:17.776
on in your DefCon group and get
more exposure to what you’re
doing in your local community.

00:31:17.776-->00:31:22.848
>>And if you follow “at
DefCongroups” on Twitter, we
will retweet DefCon groups that

00:31:22.848-->00:31:26.752
are tweeting about their
upcoming meetups and things like
that and things people are

00:31:26.752-->00:31:32.958
working on so it’s a good way to
find out um what’s going on and
what’s coming up. >>And

00:31:32.958-->00:31:36.962
something I just want to add to
that too- in your interview
videos, if you could just do a

00:31:36.962-->00:31:42.300
quick y’know like one or two
sentence blurbs about projects
that your group does because

00:31:42.300-->00:31:46.471
thats a really cool way to share
those ideas across other groups
for those that are looking for

00:31:46.471-->00:31:52.110
something to do so just
something in mind to keep
whenever you actually do those

00:31:52.110-->00:31:58.350
interview videos. So. >>Who else
has a question? Yes.
>>[indiscernible question from

00:31:58.350-->00:32:09.427
audience] >>Well, oh my gosh
don’t get me started on talking
about malicious hackers. Um no-

00:32:09.427-->00:32:14.566
no it’s not like your putting
your targets it’s like it’s not
malicious hackers it’s criminals

00:32:14.566-->00:32:18.303
that go after you. There’s a
distinct different it’s like I
did a whole talk about that

00:32:18.303-->00:32:24.176
once. Uh no um I don’t think it
puts any more of a mark on you
than anything else. It’s like

00:32:24.176-->00:32:28.313
there- there’s- you’re trying to
help and be better and if
someone’s going to use that as

00:32:28.313-->00:32:32.150
a- I mean I have been doxxed.
It’s like all my information has
been doxxed. It’s like my home

00:32:32.150-->00:32:36.254
address. I’ve got 26 cameras
inside and outside my house and
stuff because I know what’s been

00:32:36.254-->00:32:42.327
going on. It’s not pleasant but
it doesn’t matter. I wouldn’t
change a thing. I’m proud of

00:32:42.327-->00:32:46.898
what I do and I’m proud of what
I’m doing so if they want to
come at y’know, they’re gonna

00:32:46.898-->00:32:51.436
come at you no matter what you
say or what you do so
disregardless of your being a

00:32:51.436-->00:32:55.941
member of a DefCon group or your
POC contact information is out
there on the web cuz hopefully

00:32:55.941-->00:32:59.811
you’re using a generic gmail
account for your POC because
that is out there on the web. Um

00:32:59.811-->00:33:04.416
it’s like it doesn’t matter.
It’s like, you’re there. You’re
trying to help the community and

00:33:04.416-->00:33:09.754
screw anyone else trying to mess
with that. >>Yeah as long as
you’re not associating yourself

00:33:09.754-->00:33:14.926
with things that illegal
obviously then there’s like that
shouldn’t be too big of a

00:33:14.926-->00:33:20.632
concern but yeah if you’re
taking the- the time out of your
schedule and step out there and

00:33:20.632-->00:33:24.669
contribute to the community then
y’know good for you. Thank you.
>>Yeah we got a comment right

00:33:24.669-->00:33:28.540
here from someone that maybe has
some experience with it.
>>Sorry. >>You stole the mic.

00:33:28.540-->00:33:36.014
>>Alright. Um hello my name is
Zack. I’m one of the
co-organizers from Knoxville’s

00:33:36.014-->00:33:41.453
DefCon chapter of DC865 and I-
just to remark about the
potential possibility of

00:33:41.453-->00:33:47.726
criminals that would happen to
join the group- a lot of our
dedicated members are actually

00:33:47.726-->00:33:51.463
dedicated to promoting the
profession of information
security and to make sure that

00:33:51.463-->00:33:56.468
y’know your personal information
is safe and that y’know your
devices and your systems can

00:33:56.468-->00:34:02.507
actually be trusted. With that
said criminal are antithetical
to y’know what weactually do and

00:34:02.507-->00:34:09.447
we- and y’know if you try to do
anything weird, you will get
caught. Not just possibly by us

00:34:09.447-->00:34:15.287
or other hackers or the
authorities so it’s- it’s- it’s
futile to even go down that

00:34:15.287-->00:34:20.425
road. >>Actually that reminds me
of a really funny story. The
only criminal interaction I have

00:34:20.425-->00:34:26.398
ever had at a DefCon group
meeting was at DC214 where some
guy in a white shirt- I don’t

00:34:26.398-->00:34:30.669
know I forgot where it is- it
was where the book place was but
it- but it was hilarious because

00:34:30.669-->00:34:35.173
it was a guy in a white collared
shirt dress khakis it’s like
literally I think they were

00:34:35.173-->00:34:40.211
DIckies and uh he showed up
because he heard there was a
hacker meet up and he wanted to

00:34:40.211-->00:34:45.350
know how to hack around his
proxy at work so he could get
facebook and twitter onto his

00:34:45.350-->00:34:49.921
computer. That is the only
criminal activity I have ever
encountered and it was some

00:34:49.921-->00:34:55.660
sales guy from some life
insurance company so uh sorry to
out the guy from the life

00:34:55.660-->00:35:00.231
insurance company but yeah that
is the only criminal interaction
I have ever had at a DefCon

00:35:00.231-->00:35:04.069
group uh meeting anywhere in the
world. It’s like- was that guy.
>>He’s actually sitting over

00:35:04.069-->00:35:07.706
there Jayson. >>Oops. My bad.
He’s probably still looking for
that proxy work around. >>Let me

00:35:07.706-->00:35:12.611
uh, say something real quick too
like I uh so I teach a lock
picking workshop. I did that

00:35:12.611-->00:35:17.916
with DC859 at one point at one
of the CreateSpaces and they had
concerns cuz they were like

00:35:17.916-->00:35:21.252
“well aren’t you just teaching
people how to break into
places?” and no. We’re teaching

00:35:21.252-->00:35:26.858
people how to use correct cores
and good locks and how to y’know
fix the stuff. Remediate against

00:35:26.858-->00:35:32.864
it. And so I think even that is-
is even having a preface that
says at your meetings if you’re

00:35:32.864-->00:35:37.102
teaching something where’ you’re
like hey, if there’s some
criminals here they might use it

00:35:37.102-->00:35:41.172
or whatever I mean you can’t be
responsible for people, but you
should have the preface of

00:35:41.172-->00:35:46.544
saying hey, we’re teaching this
for security awareness purposes
and so you know and so you have

00:35:46.544-->00:35:51.583
a more comprehensive
understanding of how technology
or physical security or whatever

00:35:51.583-->00:35:56.654
works. And that’s one of the
drives for InfoSec right? So I
think having that mindset as a-

00:35:56.654-->00:36:01.793
as a DC group is important as
well. >>And I think Casey should
be able to say some words about

00:36:01.793-->00:36:06.431
like- cuz he works with the uh
hacking groups there in Oklahoma
and he also works with InfoGuard

00:36:06.431-->00:36:11.503
as well so- and they do stuff
together so why don’t you talk a
little bit about that. >>I- I

00:36:11.503-->00:36:16.074
think one of the biggest things
that I want to say if that the
guy standing up here at the

00:36:16.074-->00:36:20.412
podium right here- he’s one of
the biggest advocates for our
community that I’ve ever seem.

00:36:20.412-->00:36:25.583
Um [applause] He’s- he’s
probably going to get onto me
for saying that but it’s the

00:36:25.583-->00:36:35.126
truth. Um my first DefCon was
six years ago um and never- I
would never imagine I would be

00:36:35.126-->00:36:40.865
sitting up here trying to help
people but this guy right here
encouraged me to be involved uh

00:36:40.865-->00:36:45.570
and I think that’s the biggest
part. Is be involved. You may
not be a super hacker but you

00:36:45.570-->00:36:51.843
contribute- you contribute to
all of us and when you
contribute to all of us you make

00:36:51.843-->00:36:56.681
all of us better. Uh and so
that’s the biggest thing that
I’ve learned is to be involved.

00:36:56.681-->00:37:01.553
To get out there break outside
of your shell. I- I’m socially
awkward. I’ll admit it. >>Preach

00:37:01.553-->00:37:04.956
it Casey. >>And these guys-
these guys pushed me to go out
and talk and- and to meet

00:37:04.956-->00:37:11.229
people. And it’s the best thing
that I’ve ever done. I am such a
completely different person now

00:37:11.229-->00:37:19.771
after my first DefCon than I was
before I attended and it’s all
about being involved. So just

00:37:19.771-->00:37:22.240
encourage everyone y’know be
involved in your community and
care about it. >>Yeah

00:37:22.240-->00:37:30.014
definitely. Ok um we have ten
minutes. Uh we got a question
back here. >>Does this work?

00:37:30.014-->00:37:35.720
Okay great. Yeah so I think a
lot of us that are interested in
the subject are pretty y’know

00:37:35.720-->00:37:39.524
privacy minded y’know concerned
about our identity and one of
the things I was wondering was

00:37:39.524-->00:37:43.661
uh currently on the DefCon
groups is there- on the website-
is there any identification or

00:37:43.661-->00:37:51.436
notification of user who wanted
to go- wanted to be a new member
of a DefCon group. Would they be

00:37:51.436-->00:37:58.476
notified that they had to
present ID or be searched or
anything. >>No. There are- I

00:37:58.476-->00:38:02.547
think April has a good
experience with some of the
registration on the users but I

00:38:02.547-->00:38:11.689
will start off and say that you
do not have to register uh with
your uh own ID to go to a DefCon

00:38:11.689-->00:38:16.060
group meeting. That’s not
required. Certain places you do,
but like to be a part of a

00:38:16.060-->00:38:20.899
DefCon group requires no
registration. It’s like if they
do you can use one of my

00:38:20.899-->00:38:26.604
aliases. I’ve got like 30 I can
spare. Uh it’s like but you do
not have to actually give your

00:38:26.604-->00:38:30.108
name or actually do anything.
And most people probably will
like- especially with the DC801

00:38:30.108-->00:38:33.678
and I know like other groups-
they’re all by uh hacker
handles. It’s like they’re not

00:38:33.678-->00:38:38.950
using their real names so I
don’t think that- well I know
that’s not a requirement so but

00:38:38.950-->00:38:44.255
some of the locations but
April’s got a good history on-
on some of the locations that

00:38:44.255-->00:38:47.659
may require you to register at
that meeting at that time that
she can go into. >>So one of the

00:38:47.659-->00:38:53.364
things that we’ve struggled with
is being in Boston we have a lot
of tall buildings um and there

00:38:53.364-->00:38:59.204
is building security and the
building security requires you
to show ID when you enter the

00:38:59.204-->00:39:07.178
building in order to get in. Um
we aren’t huge fans of that but
we have to comply because it’s

00:39:07.178-->00:39:13.284
where our space is and it’s free
and it’s how things are working
so we have like an- well we have

00:39:13.284-->00:39:18.823
been having an event right
registration where you pre-reg
and we give all that information

00:39:18.823-->00:39:24.629
to the building. We don’t get
that info. I personally don’t
get that info. The- the- the

00:39:24.629-->00:39:31.035
coworking space that’s hosting
us doesn’t get that info. Um it
just goes to the building. So

00:39:31.035-->00:39:36.507
when you come in you could just
show them y’know a Batman ID or
something and even if the name

00:39:36.507-->00:39:41.412
doesn’t match I don’t know that
they’d notice but um it- it’s
something- there are some places

00:39:41.412-->00:39:47.385
where you’re going to have to um
struggle with that and try to
figure out if- uh if that’s

00:39:47.385-->00:39:53.825
something you can handle as a
group or if um if you can handle
that as an individual or if you

00:39:53.825-->00:40:01.399
have another way that you could
uh present yourself with some
sort of ID that would match what

00:40:01.399-->00:40:07.538
you register as. Um obviously
it’s better if you could have a
totally anonymous drop in kind

00:40:07.538-->00:40:13.344
of thing. There’s another side
to that too where if you’re
trying to have food- pizza and

00:40:13.344-->00:40:17.849
beer for example- and you want
to know how many people are
showing up. It’s totally up to

00:40:17.849-->00:40:23.154
the organizers of the individual
group how they want to manage
all of that and um we- we talk

00:40:23.154-->00:40:31.129
internally about how- how we
want to um to- to handle this
particular issue because of the

00:40:31.129-->00:40:35.433
tall buildings and it doesn’t
matter where we end up. For some
reason we always end up in a

00:40:35.433-->00:40:41.339
really tall building that
requires- where the security
requires us to show ID. Um

00:40:41.339-->00:40:47.045
>>That’s what bypass tools are
for. >>I- I don’t condone any
illegal activity trying to get

00:40:47.045-->00:40:52.517
into tall building but um there
are certainly y’know ways to
handle that as an individual to

00:40:52.517-->00:40:59.057
protect your own privacy. >>Got
it. >>So uh real quick I want to
thank all the uh, DefCon group

00:40:59.057-->00:41:03.761
leaders that came up here uh
and- and- and contributed and
hung out for a while and

00:41:03.761-->00:41:07.865
everything. Thank you guys for
coming up here and standing
instead of being comfortable in

00:41:07.865-->00:41:16.541
your seats. I really appreciate
that. >>Thank you. >>Thank you.
[applause] >>And I’d like to

00:41:16.541-->00:41:21.079
start the closing statements and
I think everybody should have
their own closing statement on

00:41:21.079-->00:41:24.916
it but I’d like to say like this
is a group effort. There is not
one person behind DefCon groups.

00:41:24.916-->00:41:31.322
It’s like this does not
function- this does not operate
365 days a year without this

00:41:31.322-->00:41:37.228
team of people working on their
off hours, working on their
weekends, working when the times

00:41:37.228-->00:41:42.233
they can to get these things
done. And I’ve seen some of the
emails where um April was

00:41:42.233-->00:41:46.571
talking directly like why hasn’t
this been done it’s like I’ve
got all these other jobs all

00:41:46.571-->00:41:50.208
these other things to do. It’s a
volunteer effort. It’s like
we’re all volunteers trying to

00:41:50.208-->00:41:54.278
put in our time because we care
so much about the message and we
care so much about the community

00:41:54.278-->00:41:58.883
that we give our time to do
these things. SO just like it’s
this team that helps makes the

00:41:58.883-->00:42:03.521
groups organization part run,
it’s all of you that make the
community run. That make your

00:42:03.521-->00:42:07.759
individual local DefCon groups
and your just as vital as this
team so I think everybody is

00:42:07.759-->00:42:13.731
doing a great job and we just
need to do more. We need more
hackers out there working in the

00:42:13.731-->00:42:23.775
community together. So thank
you. [applause] >>Thank you
Jayson. Thank you guys for uh

00:42:23.775-->00:42:28.880
y’know everything you do. Uh
originally we had planned to
sort of split up the room if you

00:42:28.880-->00:42:32.450
wanted to join a group you were
going to go to one side or if
you wanted to start a group. If

00:42:32.450-->00:42:36.687
you were already in a group and
you had ideas you were going to
go to another side. Uh the

00:42:36.687-->00:42:42.860
logistics of that aren’t going
to work so what we’re going to
do is um after- after the

00:42:42.860-->00:42:49.000
closing ceremony? So after
closing ceremony anybody that
has questions if you want to

00:42:49.000-->00:42:57.241
join a group or start a group
then you will see April or
Casey. Uh if you have questions

00:42:57.241-->00:43:03.481
about ideas for your group like
projects things like that, come
see Tim or myself. And then

00:43:03.481-->00:43:09.353
Jayson will do his Jayson Street
thing and sort of float around
everywhere so catch him if you

00:43:09.353-->00:43:16.561
can. But um does- that’s it for
me. Do you guys- and we’ll keep
the closing comments. >>Um yeah

00:43:16.561-->00:43:21.732
guys. This is my first Miss
America speech but um just a
reminder that communities build

00:43:21.732-->00:43:27.572
each other up. They don’t tear
each other down so kind of keep
that mentality that even when

00:43:27.572-->00:43:31.876
you’re feeling a little bummed
or left out or something.
There’s a lot of people here and

00:43:31.876-->00:43:35.580
there’s a lot of people that
love and they want to share
information and no question is

00:43:35.580-->00:43:45.289
stupid so. >>That’s it? >>Um be
excellent to each other. >>There
you go. All right, yeah.

00:43:45.289-->00:43:52.864
[applause] >>Alright hey I
really appreciate you guys uh
your cooperation and everything

00:43:52.864-->00:43:57.668
again.. After closing ceremonies
uh if you want to hang out in
here just come find us and I

00:43:57.668-->00:00:00.000
really appreciate it and just
have an awesome rest of the day.
Thank you. [applause]
