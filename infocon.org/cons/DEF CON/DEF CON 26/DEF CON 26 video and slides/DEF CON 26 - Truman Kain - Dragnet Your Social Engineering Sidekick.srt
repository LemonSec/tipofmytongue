00:00:00.000-->00:00:05.005
>>Alright, Truman Kain, um
Social Engineering [clapping]
yeah, another clap please, ha.

00:00:07.274-->00:00:12.212
[applause] Thanks. >> Thanks.
Blake had too much to say about
me so he figured there wasn’t

00:00:12.212-->00:00:17.217
enough time. Ok so who here is
from the abstract? Who here read
the abstract and that’s why they

00:00:17.217-->00:00:23.524
wanted to come? Raise your
hands. Yeah. Dragnet one hell of
a catch, one hell of a catch.

00:00:23.524-->00:00:30.397
Okay so I’m Truman Kain I‘m a
security Associate from Tevora.
We do cyber security, pen

00:00:30.397-->00:00:35.369
testing, that type of thing.
And, I’ve decided to make a
social engineering framework

00:00:35.369-->00:00:41.008
called Dragnet and that’s what
we’re going to talk about today.
So, if you didn’t read the, the

00:00:41.008-->00:00:47.047
abstract. Uh basically um, you-
your conversion on phishing
emails, phishing calls, physical

00:00:47.047-->00:00:51.318
engagements, uh those
conversions are all going to
increase when you use this

00:00:51.318-->00:00:57.391
framework. What do I mean by
conversions, basically things
like credentials being entered.

00:00:57.391-->00:01:01.495
Um people giving you information
they’re not supposed to be
giving you. That type of thing.

00:01:01.495-->00:01:05.198
Uh so that’s what I’m
considering a conversion for
these purposes. Uh first I’m

00:01:05.198-->00:01:10.671
gonna, I’m gonna get into the
current states of OSINT,
Analytics, Social Engineering

00:01:10.671-->00:01:15.309
Engagements. Um, and, and then
we’ll, then we’ll, we’ll talk
about the tool, but uh I also

00:01:15.309-->00:01:18.779
want let you guys know that
these are my insights, you guys
might not feel the same way,

00:01:18.779-->00:01:23.650
about everything I say, hey I
recognize you. Um, and, and so
this is just what I’ve observed.

00:01:23.650-->00:01:28.655
Okay, so wh-when I think about
OSINT I think that um, I want a
high quality reliable data that

00:01:31.591-->00:01:36.463
I’m collecting on my target and
the collection process usually
ends up being manual because,

00:01:36.463-->00:01:41.635
well when you, when you see a
successful spear phishing attack
there’s almost always manual

00:01:41.635-->00:01:46.206
OSINT going on. Uh, it can be
for a few reasons, a couple. It
might be that you want to verify

00:01:46.206-->00:01:50.310
the information that you’re
getting is, is accurate. Also,
so that you can tailor your

00:01:50.310-->00:01:56.283
attack, uh to your target. Uh,
as you learn more about them but
all of it is so that you have a

00:01:56.283-->00:02:01.888
higher chance of conversion uh
when you when you execute the
attack. So, a-aside some minor

00:02:01.888-->00:02:05.926
variations this process is
extremely repetitive. And once
you’ve gone through the OSINT

00:02:05.926-->00:02:10.364
phase on a couple of targets uh
you kind of have down your
process, maybe you have a couple

00:02:10.364-->00:02:14.534
targets form each industry, you
kind of um, you know, you get
down what you’re going to be

00:02:14.534-->00:02:18.572
doing. So, you think okay why
can’t, why can’t this be
automated and sometimes you can

00:02:18.572-->00:02:23.877
automate things, uh but once
the, the automation um, starts
turning into the heavy lifting a

00:02:23.877-->00:02:28.448
lot of the times you’ll see big
sites start to change their
template and, and they just

00:02:28.448-->00:02:33.186
coincidentally um roll out an
update that just destroys the
most populate, ya know scraping

00:02:33.186-->00:02:40.060
tool. Um so, so that would be
why um, when when we see
automation work it’s fleeting,

00:02:40.060-->00:02:46.266
it, it doesn’t last very long.
So, here, here’s the current
state of analytics. A-A, sorry I

00:02:46.266-->00:02:53.073
had something else I wanted to
say about the last slide. So why
do these sites care so much

00:02:53.073-->00:02:58.912
about protecting their publicly
available data? It’s because,
analytics. As a side note, I’m

00:02:58.912-->00:03:02.949
going to use big data and
analytics interchangeably for
the purpose of this topic. So

00:03:02.949-->00:03:06.153
regardless of what the company
does or what they say they do.
If you look at the companies

00:03:06.153-->00:03:10.891
with the biggest online
presence, Amazon, Google,
Facebook, that type of thing.

00:03:10.891-->00:03:15.529
Um, if, if you were to take away
their analytics, in my opinion
they would not last very long.

00:03:15.529-->00:03:19.699
You might not all believe but I
believe um, when you’re a
company that big you can’t act

00:03:19.699-->00:03:24.838
on intuition alone. Uh so not
only is every major decision
driven by analytics, even the

00:03:24.838-->00:03:29.943
smallest decisions is driven by
data as well. An example would
be the way that Facebook has, uh

00:03:29.943-->00:03:34.181
is split testing thousands of
different versions of their
website as any one time. Uh and,

00:03:34.181-->00:03:38.585
and pushing only the highest
performing features out to the
public version of the site. Uh,

00:03:38.585-->00:03:42.923
but not only do these big
companies live off of analytics,
sometimes it’s the way the

00:03:42.923-->00:03:48.361
companies are born. Uh, this is
a, a quote by, by Jeff Bezos in
1997, I’m not, I’m not going to

00:03:48.361-->00:03:53.934
read it in the Jeff Bezos voice
from the video if you’ve seen
it. Uh he says, “3 years ago I

00:03:53.934-->00:03:57.771
was working in a quantitative
hedge fund when I came across a
startling statistic.” So that

00:03:57.771-->00:04:02.409
statistic uh stated just how
rapidly consumers were moving
online. It’s also what caused

00:04:02.409-->00:04:08.582
Jeff to leave the company he was
at to start Amazon. And it’s now
why we’re inpatient uh when we

00:04:08.582-->00:04:13.887
can’t get things delivered the
same day. Uh, so you’re sold,
right? You’re gonna go out,

00:04:13.887-->00:04:17.891
you’re gonna study the blade, I
mean study the data and, and
start the next Amazon, right?

00:04:20.327-->00:04:25.832
Well as I look around the room
I’m not so convinced. Because
for, fortunately for those of

00:04:25.832-->00:04:29.803
you who take Jeff’s quote to
heart, the data is already out
there and it can be used for

00:04:29.803-->00:04:34.107
things other than starting or
growing business. Like
destroying them, no, like social

00:04:34.107-->00:04:39.112
engineering. So, I’m a fan of
Amazon by the way, I don’t need
my accounts shut down this is

00:04:41.114-->00:04:45.018
all educational purposed with
this tool. So, for those of you
who conduct social engineering

00:04:45.018-->00:04:48.822
engagements legally you may
resonate with this chart. The
client doesn’t even get to

00:04:48.822-->00:04:54.060
choose two, they get to choose
one, effective, quick or
inexpensive. In this current

00:04:54.060-->00:04:58.331
state and I’m generalizing a
little bit but uh, the companies
with big budgets are the only

00:04:58.331-->00:05:02.102
ones getting social engineering
pen testing and I believe that
needs to change. Let me grab

00:05:02.102-->00:05:07.674
some water. Uh so Fortune 5000
companies are already being
targeted in mass. I believe that

00:05:07.674-->00:05:12.045
smaller business in certain
industries are gonna quickly
become uh th-the next big focus

00:05:12.045-->00:05:17.050
for social engineering attacks
based on the data they hold and
the lack of uh security

00:05:20.353-->00:05:26.226
awareness training. I needed to
include Zucks somewhere in here.
So, I think I’ve depressed

00:05:26.226-->00:05:31.831
everyone enough with that last
part so what can we do about
this? So, Dragnet is this social

00:05:31.831-->00:05:34.901
engineering framework that I’m
going to get into now. We’ll
watch demo in a little bit uh,

00:05:34.901-->00:05:39.639
but um I believe that Dragnet
is, is gonna be a populate
solution for pen testers. I’m

00:05:39.639-->00:05:43.577
committed to continually
improving on it as long as the
demand is there. What I said

00:05:43.577-->00:05:49.349
about uh OSINT auto-automation
uh being fleeting. For every
start on the GitHub that’s going

00:05:49.349-->00:05:55.121
to mean an hour of me, ya know
going back and re-improving. So
free labor basically, I- I mean

00:05:55.121-->00:05:58.825
it’s, it’s a cheap, it’s cheap
labor for you guys. So, I- I
would recommend starting this

00:05:58.825-->00:06:03.530
project if you like and, and
maybe ya know the OSINT stops
working, star the project and

00:06:03.530-->00:06:08.535
that’s an hour I’m just going to
be sitting in my mom’s basement.
So, I, I, where was I here? So,

00:06:12.138-->00:06:14.741
I’m gonna quickly cover the
frameworks OSINT, Automation,
and Machine Learning

00:06:14.741-->00:06:18.778
capabilities and then we’re
going to check out a quick demo.
I’m also happy to see, say that

00:06:18.778-->00:06:23.350
Dragnet is um and will continue
to be open source. So, I believe
that this target template

00:06:23.350-->00:06:27.621
correlation learning thing.
[applause] Oh. [applause] Uh, so
the whole correlation, thank you

00:06:27.621-->00:06:33.960
whoever started that, very nice.
Uh, the, the whole
recommendation system thing, AI

00:06:33.960-->00:06:38.965
is being implemented into
everything. The data is already
out there. I think that pretty

00:06:41.268-->00:06:45.872
much every phishing tool, is, is
going to start implementing
this. That’s why I’m really

00:06:45.872-->00:06:50.744
excited to, to try to be on the
cutting edge. I think this is a
cool thing and it’s becoming a

00:06:50.744-->00:06:55.715
lot easier to forecast like me
to implement this in the
projects. So, this is

00:06:55.715-->00:07:00.186
essentially The Stack.
TensorFlow for machine learning.
Firebase for the Zeno SQL

00:07:00.186-->00:07:05.492
database backend and Vue.js uh
for the front end. Uh things
like Asterisk and Flask are also

00:07:05.492-->00:07:11.932
used and and there’s, there’s a
bunch of different integrations
as well. So, here’s how Dragnet

00:07:11.932-->00:07:16.836
OSINT works. Uh you’re gonna
start a new engagement you’re
gonna Dragon Drop in a CSV with

00:07:16.836-->00:07:22.609
your, uh with our targets names
and emails or phone numbers. And
then OSINT begins. And if a

00:07:22.609-->00:07:27.514
particular target already exists
within the company uh that the
engagement is for then the OSINT

00:07:27.514-->00:07:31.618
is going to restart, changes are
going to be tracked and a new
recommendation is going to be

00:07:31.618-->00:07:37.324
made. This almost entirely
automated, hence keep your hands
near the wheel. This is using

00:07:37.324-->00:07:42.028
lead enrichment integrations and
also manual scraping at times.
So, their reason for the hands

00:07:42.028-->00:07:45.432
near the wheel is because
sometimes you’re gonna get
people with the same name from

00:07:45.432-->00:07:50.337
the same company. And so, you
need to decide who is your
actual target. Uh because if you

00:07:50.337-->00:07:56.543
choose wrong, you could skew the
uh model uh for, y-you could
skew the entire model so that

00:07:56.543-->00:08:00.447
the recommendation for someone
completely different that you
think there is no correlation

00:08:00.447-->00:08:04.351
between uh gets a different
suggestion, one that’s not
accurate because you chose the

00:08:04.351-->00:08:09.356
wrong person and because the
data points about them uh
weren’t correct. Um, so. Am I on

00:08:15.495-->00:08:20.500
the right slide here for
everyone? Okay cool. This is the
old version. Sorry guys. Alright

00:08:34.280-->00:08:39.285
that didn’t work. [clicking] Is
this where I”m sup- start
dancing like Ashley Simpson?

00:08:50.730-->00:08:55.735
Okay, so, okay, so this is the
model uh essentially. I really
don’t know how any of this

00:09:11.818-->00:09:17.424
works. I kind of just like
watched a bunch of videos and
was just like trying, to, to get

00:09:17.424-->00:09:22.862
it to work. It barely makes
sense to me but essentially how
it works is, ha, essentially how

00:09:22.862-->00:09:26.633
it works is you’re going to tag
the templates that you’re using.
Uh so you’re gonna say, say for

00:09:26.633-->00:09:31.237
example unusual login detected,
so you’re gonna say urgency
might get a tag. And it’s from

00:09:31.237-->00:09:34.908
LinkedIn so you’re going to give
it a LinkedIn tab. Maybe you’re
doing an Amazon Wish, Amazon

00:09:34.908-->00:09:40.079
Wishlist uh phishing template
and you’re gonna use tags like
amazon, shopping, maybe it’s a

00:09:40.079-->00:09:45.285
Facebook poke email and you use
things like, lust, ya know for
example. Things like that. Uh

00:09:45.285-->00:09:50.490
then the OSINT automation is
going to um, create data points
which essentially, we’re calling

00:09:50.490-->00:09:55.829
target features. Uh things like
someone’s age, their name,
maybe, maybe their gender, maybe

00:09:55.829-->00:10:01.067
uh previous work experience.
That type of thing. Uh labels
are gonna be what are taken from

00:10:01.067-->00:10:05.738
your previous engagements, uh,
the, the data on whether a
target ya know clicked, uh

00:10:05.738-->00:10:09.309
filled out a form they weren’t
supposed to, executed a payload,
that type of thing. It’s going

00:10:09.309-->00:10:14.614
to give them a rating, all to
end up with a probability of
Pwn. Uh so that’s what we’re l-,

00:10:14.614-->00:10:21.020
we’re after. So, i- put simply
you’re going to tag your
templates. You’re going to

00:10:21.020-->00:10:26.025
import the prior conversion data
and then you’re gonna say your
prayers. Alright so we’re gonna

00:10:39.038-->00:10:44.043
watch a demo. Alright so here we
are in the dashboard engagement
section. You can see that we

00:10:50.617-->00:10:56.356
have an upcoming, in progress
and completed uh, filter. We
have some clients that we worked

00:10:56.356-->00:11:01.294
with recently. But we’re gonna,
we’re gonna start a new pen test
for Pied Piper. They’re, they’re

00:11:03.429-->00:11:08.935
a client we decided to take on.
So, we’re gonna choose from the
existing companies. We’re gonna

00:11:08.935-->00:11:13.573
choose the type of test that
we’re running. This one’s
Phishing and Vishing. And we’re

00:11:13.573-->00:11:18.578
gonna choose a start and end
date. Okay so these 3 uh,
contacts are our essentially

00:11:27.253-->00:11:31.558
targets that we have already
uploaded for Pied Piper, they’ve
already, we’ve already run uh,

00:11:31.558-->00:11:35.461
e- e- an engagement against
them. But I’m gonna drag in a
new file with some new targets.

00:11:35.461-->00:11:41.734
The target list is populated and
now I can choose who I want to
include. And um, ya know, and

00:11:41.734-->00:11:46.372
also choose which uh type of
test they’re going to be
involved in. So, Gilfoyle is

00:11:46.372-->00:11:51.344
only going to be uh doing
phishing. We’re gonna get rid,
I- I’m scared of Jared so we’re

00:11:51.344-->00:11:56.649
going to get rid of him
completely Uh, he’s just too
easy. Uh, uh big head so we’re

00:11:56.649-->00:12:02.889
gonna get rid of him. And then
we’re gonna run uh, just the
phishing on a couple of other of

00:12:02.889-->00:12:07.894
the targets here. And I think
yeah there we go, so view that
bug. Okay, so now we’re going to

00:12:14.968-->00:12:18.671
save and OSINT begins. So, as
you can see on the right uh this
says attack ready that’s how

00:12:18.671-->00:12:24.243
fast, let me see, I don’t think
I can go back. That’s how fast
essentially that the OSINT is,

00:12:24.243-->00:12:28.982
is being done and because the
model is already trained and
will be trained each time

00:12:28.982-->00:12:34.120
someone uh coverts or, or we get
one of those labels that you saw
from the, from the equation

00:12:34.120-->00:12:38.558
slide. Uh the model is going to
be retrained. Once that happens,
to create the prediction is

00:12:38.558-->00:12:43.563
going to be extremely quick. So,
you can see we have things like
starting ML prediction. This

00:12:46.466-->00:12:51.504
last update column on the right
is going to show what the last
thing to happen was. But we, we

00:12:51.504-->00:12:54.774
also see that we have an action
required in addition to the
attack ready. The action

00:12:54.774-->00:12:59.779
required is on Jin Yang.
Interesting. Kay, click the
button. This is prerecorded.

00:13:02.482-->00:13:08.021
They started, they wanted us to
pre-record these so which is
probably a good thing. Click the

00:13:08.021-->00:13:13.693
button, there we go. Okay, so
which of these is Jin Yang? This
is what I was talking about

00:13:13.693-->00:13:17.530
where hands near the wheel. I
have to pick which one is my
target. I just happen to know

00:13:17.530-->00:13:22.101
that this is a male, maybe,
maybe I’ve seen the target,
maybe I know roughly what age

00:13:22.101-->00:13:27.807
she is, I can call the client to
maybe get that data. So, choose
the easy target. It started

00:13:27.807-->00:13:32.912
OSINT, it completed OSINT uh
because I’m, I have an
integration like clear bit or uh

00:13:32.912-->00:13:37.917
full contact and that’s why the
OSINT is going to be faster.
Okay so now I just launched, you

00:13:37.917-->00:13:42.121
can see some people say email
scheduled, some people say
sending email. This is based on

00:13:42.121-->00:13:47.894
the, oh, what’s this? So, I want
to explain a little bit more.
Uh. But it looks like we have a

00:13:47.894-->00:13:53.633
notification that Jin Yang
already opened out email. Would
we like to phish him now? So,

00:13:53.633-->00:13:59.605
this is because it’s a linked
template that wants you to call
and follow up as soon as uh, the

00:13:59.605-->00:14:04.844
target opens the email. Not all
of these templates need to be
linked. On the right you can see

00:14:04.844-->00:14:10.583
a mini dossier area this is
going to be that, uh check mark
indicates that its’ confirmed.

00:14:10.583-->00:14:14.887
The data is confirmed. The
fingerprint indicates this was
um using OSINT that we found

00:14:14.887-->00:14:19.892
this. Things like education
history info, background, work
history and so we see an attack

00:14:22.895-->00:14:26.933
log that shows the email was
sent and opened and at what
time. We have our script right

00:14:26.933-->00:14:31.738
here that we’re going to be
using with his name uh included.
And we can place the call

00:14:31.738-->00:14:38.511
whenever we are ready. And it
should be hopefully sound for
this. [phone ringing] So, this

00:14:38.511-->00:14:43.516
is calling my attack phone, then
calling Jin Yang from the masked
number. >>Richard, you are ugly.

00:14:50.590-->00:14:55.595
>>Okay, so he apparently knew,
knew that this was um, not a
legit call. Uh so did we get the

00:15:01.534-->00:15:06.539
goods? No. He’s not falling. And
uh, the, the recording if the
client allows is going to be

00:15:09.342-->00:15:13.479
uploaded uh to, to our servers
and, and we would be able to
play it here. [phone ringing]

00:15:13.479-->00:15:18.484
I’m going to fast forward a
little bit. [phone ringing]
>>Richard, you are ugly. >>Okay,

00:15:23.156-->00:15:28.161
Okay so we see the attack log on
the bottom right has updated.
And we can go back and we see

00:15:31.697-->00:15:37.403
now there’s some o-other
updates, on last updated we see
call unsuccessful on Jin Yang.

00:15:37.403-->00:15:42.408
And call scheduled and we see
credits captured for Monica.
Okay so we’re gonna click on the

00:15:44.610-->00:15:49.615
phishing template and we see the
email that was sent, Gavin
Belson wants to connect. We see

00:15:49.615-->00:15:53.753
the credentials captured there
right on the top right, or in
the middle. We have her mini

00:15:53.753-->00:16:00.459
dossier area and we can see the
credentials entered on the
attack log as well. So, if we

00:16:00.459-->00:16:05.464
click we can see that this come
on click on this email here.
Basically, we’re gonna be able

00:16:08.534-->00:16:13.539
to see the landing page that she
was sent to, is not LinkedIn.
It’s Line-k-d In. So, this is

00:16:15.741-->00:16:20.980
the landing page and where she
fell for the uh credentials
captured attack. So, we can

00:16:20.980-->00:16:26.819
click on her little avatar there
and see the full dossier and
it’s essentially just a, um a

00:16:26.819-->00:16:30.723
more spread-out version of the
mini dossier that you saw. And
also, one cool thing is this, in

00:16:30.723-->00:16:35.561
the target history section is
not just about the attach it um
all attached and it’s also

00:16:35.561-->00:16:40.366
things like when she was added
to a certain company, when OSINT
started, was completed when

00:16:40.366-->00:16:45.371
templates were suggested, that
type of thing. Okay. So, I
believe that is it. Yep. Cool.

00:16:54.647-->00:16:59.652
Okay so that’s the demo. And.
What’s next? Um things like
ringless voicemail drops once uh

00:17:05.958-->00:17:10.162
ya know once we get inbound
calling setup you’ll be able to
do things like this earlier in

00:17:10.162-->00:17:14.600
the morning. Maybe when someone
is not going to be around their
phone and try to get them to

00:17:14.600-->00:17:18.537
call you, call you back. Things
like really focusing on
individual targeting so you

00:17:18.537-->00:17:23.209
don’t have to do things through
a company, again for educational
purposes. Uh distributed vishing

00:17:23.209-->00:17:28.047
so you might be able to have a
team setup and, and be able to
get them, um, um setup with

00:17:28.047-->00:17:31.751
multiple attack phones. That
type of thing. Native Mobile, I
think would be really cool, uh,

00:17:31.751-->00:17:35.922
to be able to have in an app to,
to manage this and to be able to
d-do all the calls through an

00:17:35.922-->00:17:40.126
app. I think that would be
really cool. And your requests
here is the bottom one, so I uh,

00:17:40.126-->00:17:46.032
I really am committed to working
on this. Uh, I’m not gonna be
the guy that’s like eh submit a

00:17:46.032-->00:17:49.869
pool request. Like I’ll do the
work. You guys if there’s enough
people that want something they

00:17:49.869-->00:17:55.007
can plus 1 it if somebody
suggests it, suggests it on a,
on GitHub’s site. I’d really

00:17:55.007-->00:17:58.311
appreciate if you guys give your
ideas there. I’d be happy to do
that. Thanks. [applause] Thank

00:17:58.311-->00:18:03.249
you so Dragnet is going to be
released on GitHub in the next
few days. Uh the repo is live.

00:18:06.052-->00:18:11.057
You can get it through the Dwarf
threat link. But I’d like you to
watch the repo so you’re

00:18:13.459-->00:18:18.464
notified as soon as the
framework is released which will
be in a few days. Also thank you

00:18:20.499-->00:18:25.738
to Kevin, Steven, Clayton and
Ray from Tevora. This uh,
framework wouldn’t exist without

00:18:25.738-->00:18:30.209
them. Thanks again guys, thanks.
[applause]
