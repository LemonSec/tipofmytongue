00:00:00.100-->00:00:06.306
>>Next we have uh Matt, uh all
the way from the UK. He works at
PwC. And he is going to talk

00:00:06.306-->00:00:12.279
about attribution and the
hardest part of digital
forensics, placing a person at a

00:00:12.279-->00:00:17.284
keyboard at a specific time.
Let's give him a big round of
applause. [applause] >>Cheers.

00:00:22.723-->00:00:26.727
Okay, uh hi everyone, thank you
very much for coming. Uh so this
is Betrayed by the Keyboard: How

00:00:26.727-->00:00:32.699
What You Type Can Give You Away.
Um so just a disclaimer. It's
for educational purposes only.

00:00:32.699-->00:00:37.704
In terms of what this talk
isn't, did anyone come to my
talk last year uh at DefCon? A

00:00:37.704-->00:00:43.644
couple of people so you might be
a little bit disappointed. Um,
so that talk about drones and

00:00:43.644-->00:00:48.382
lasers and ultrasonic pulses and
I had some really nice feedback
from people that said please do

00:00:48.382-->00:00:53.120
more of the same stuff next
year. So this talk is all about
inferential statistics. Um

00:00:56.356-->00:01:00.060
[laughter] So my name is Matt
Wixey, uh I'm no good at taking
direction apparently, uh and I

00:01:00.060-->00:01:04.932
lead research for PwC
cybersecurity practice in the
UK. Uh I work on this ethical

00:01:04.932-->00:01:10.571
hacking team, I'm a part-time
doctoral researcher at UCL, uh
and my previous job before PwC

00:01:10.571-->00:01:16.743
was working law enforcement in
the UK uh leading a technical
R&D team. So this talk is based

00:01:16.743-->00:01:21.748
on some research I did at UCL uh
um before my PhD, it's now being
continued at PwC. And I have an

00:01:24.351-->00:01:28.622
interest in in side-channel
attacks generally. Um but what
I'm particularly interested in

00:01:28.622-->00:01:33.393
is something I call human side
channels, which is kind of
unconsciously unconscious

00:01:33.393-->00:01:38.432
leakage of various um queues
that can together be brought
together to try and link things

00:01:38.432-->00:01:43.570
and attribute things. Uh my
first degree was in English
language and literature, so I

00:01:43.570-->00:01:49.910
have an interest in uh forensic
linguistics. Uh and that kind of
side channel approach as well.

00:01:49.910-->00:01:53.847
So I'm gonna cover what
attribution is and some problems
with traditional approaches to

00:01:53.847-->00:01:59.152
it; uh I'm then gonna move on to
case linkage analysis or CLA,
which is a possible solution to

00:01:59.152-->00:02:05.225
that. I'm gonna talk about an
experiment I did at ULA to try
and test that out um and cover

00:02:05.225-->00:02:09.396
the results and implications.
And then I'm gonna sum up and
I'll give some ideas for future

00:02:09.396-->00:02:15.602
research in this area as well.
So what would we want to do
attribution, what the benefits,

00:02:15.602-->00:02:20.207
what kind of types are they,
what kind of approaches. So uh
it's a bit of a hot topic in

00:02:20.207-->00:02:24.177
literature in terms of what we
mean by attribution. Uh
something that it means

00:02:24.177-->00:02:29.916
identifying the location, um or
country or organizations behind
an attack. Others think it means

00:02:29.916-->00:02:34.621
putting an actual individual at
the keyboard, um and some people
would think it it means trying

00:02:34.621-->00:02:39.493
to find a machine that as
responsible or that was used
rather than a human. Uh several

00:02:39.493-->00:02:45.699
benefits to doing it from an
investigative point of view, um
there's an argument that you may

00:02:45.699-->00:02:51.538
deter future attacks, again
that's uh been again debated in
the literature, but it's uh a

00:02:51.538-->00:02:56.376
perspective. Um interrupting and
disrupting ongoing attacks, um
and then depending on which side

00:02:56.376-->00:02:59.579
you're on and which side of the
fence you're on, it's a
desirable outcome um

00:02:59.579-->00:03:04.518
potentially. So Hutchins and
others in 2011 uh categorized 3
different kinds of uh indicators

00:03:07.888-->00:03:14.127
of compromise, IOCs that could
be used for attribution. Uh they
talked about atomic IOCs, by

00:03:14.127-->00:03:17.898
which they mean things like IP
addresses, email addresses,
domain names, discrete

00:03:17.898-->00:03:23.603
identifiers basically. Uh they
also covered computed IOCs, by
which they mean hash values from

00:03:23.603-->00:03:29.409
malware, uh for instance. And
then behavioral IOCs, what an
attacker does on a computer once

00:03:29.409-->00:03:34.414
they have access to it. Now
there's also sort of uh issues
with some of these. Um so atomic

00:03:36.683-->00:03:41.321
IOCS, for instance, um the
easiest result, depending on the
amount of resources that are

00:03:41.321-->00:03:45.992
available to you, generally the
most effective uh and the most
direct in terms of finding out

00:03:45.992-->00:03:50.931
who did what, um but also the
most easiest uh from an
attacker's perspective to spoof

00:03:50.931-->00:03:55.936
or obfuscate or anonymize .
Computed IOCs are only as good
as the uh the particular method

00:03:59.039-->00:04:02.709
you're using. So if you're using
a hash value to identify
malware, for instance, perfectly

00:04:02.709-->00:04:06.179
valid approach, but slight
changes to that malware would
obviously result in a different

00:04:06.179-->00:04:12.719
hash value. Um along the same
kind of lines, there are um
other methods of computed IOCs,

00:04:12.719-->00:04:19.226
so one that's used quite a lot
is trying to correlate malicious
activity with um office hours in

00:04:19.226-->00:04:23.096
a particular time zone for
instance, and then say that it
was uh the attack was

00:04:23.096-->00:04:27.901
perpetrated in a particular
location. Um so that's been used
in a few studies, it's been used

00:04:27.901-->00:04:34.508
in a PcW um investigation last
year called CloudHopper. Um
there's also the approach we're

00:04:34.508-->00:04:40.080
trying to deanonymize
programmers uh and developers
either through their stylistics,

00:04:40.080-->00:04:45.352
so the way that they write code,
or through artifacts in compiled
code. Uh so Caliskan and others

00:04:45.352-->00:04:50.524
a few years ago um looked at
trying to deanonymize developers
through compiled binaries and

00:04:50.524-->00:04:57.397
Caliskan and Greenstadt did a
talk this year at DefCon on uh
um an extended um uh approach to

00:04:57.397-->00:05:02.836
that. You can also look at
similarities in malware, in the
capabilities malware has and try

00:05:02.836-->00:05:07.340
and use that as an attribution
technique. So a good example of
that would be Stuxnet and

00:05:07.340-->00:05:12.846
DOS/Coup, which both had similar
capabilities. And then finally
you can try and just look at if

00:05:12.846-->00:05:16.516
it's a human doing an attack or
a bot. And that was done a few
years ago, um based on various

00:05:16.516-->00:05:20.754
things, and I'm going to talk a
little bit more about that
particular study uh later on.

00:05:23.590-->00:05:28.295
The problem with all of these is
that you're not so much focusing
on an individual. You're

00:05:28.295-->00:05:33.133
focusing maybe trying to
identify a state or a sponsor,
something like that. And the the

00:05:33.133-->00:05:39.573
challenge from an investigative
perspective then becomes
procedural uh legal. Uh

00:05:39.573-->00:05:43.677
behavioral profiling uh on the
other hand, is really
interesting. Um it's less about

00:05:43.677-->00:05:48.114
attribution, uhnhow it's been
historically in the literature,
it's more about trying to

00:05:48.114-->00:05:53.119
understand uhnwho commits
attacks and why they do it. Um
there's been various studies

00:05:53.119-->00:05:57.657
looking at attackers'
motivations, their skill levels,
uh the kind of culture that

00:05:57.657-->00:06:02.729
would drive them to um to
attack, their psychological
motivations for that and that

00:06:02.729-->00:06:07.734
kind of thing. And then a subset
of that category is attack
profiling. So this is looking at

00:06:09.769-->00:06:14.474
um once an attacker is on a
machine, what do they do. And
it's not so much about

00:06:14.474-->00:06:19.145
attribution it's just trying to
understand the process and the
the flow of the attack. So I

00:06:19.145-->00:06:24.317
mentioned this study, uh
Filippoupolitis and others in
2014 um looked at various

00:06:24.317-->00:06:29.489
metrics um from attacks, uh sort
of skills in typing speed,
number of mistakes, that kind of

00:06:29.489-->00:06:35.428
thing, uh to try to work out if
it was a human attacking or a
bot. Uh similarly, there have

00:06:35.428-->00:06:39.799
been studies looking at skill
level of the attackers and about
uh specific attacker behaviors

00:06:39.799-->00:06:44.804
on a compromised machine. So
that's a really interesting
approach um. What hasn't really

00:06:47.274-->00:06:52.345
been covered in the literature
is trying to use that as a
comparison method. So looking at

00:06:52.345-->00:06:57.250
attack behaviors on a machine
and trying to use that to see if
you can generate some kind of

00:06:57.250-->00:07:02.188
attack signature which can then
be used to attribute attacks. So
um this leads me on to talk

00:07:04.658-->00:07:09.663
about case linkage analysis. Uh
has anyone heard of case linkage
analysis before? Okay. A few

00:07:12.232-->00:07:17.604
people maybe? So it's a not a
particularly well-known method.
Um so to give you a bit of

00:07:17.604-->00:07:22.042
background, uh a few years ago,
I had no idea, which is, uh
trust me, it's quite a rare um

00:07:22.042-->00:07:28.315
event. Um so I was lurking in
the OSCP labs, I was doing OSCP
at the time, and uh if you've

00:07:28.315-->00:07:33.353
done OSCP, you know they have an
IOC channel uh where all the
students come together and talk

00:07:33.353-->00:07:37.390
about uh attack methods and
various machines, that kind of
thing. And just kind of

00:07:37.390-->00:07:42.028
observing the traffic and people
talking to each other, uh I made
a couple of casual observations.

00:07:42.028-->00:07:46.166
So the first is everyone had
their own way of doing
something, whether that was

00:07:46.166-->00:07:51.538
trying exfiltrate stuff or
search for stuff
post-exploitation or um you know

00:07:51.538-->00:07:56.076
download a binary to a
compromised box, whatever it
was. And the second observation

00:07:56.076-->00:07:59.546
was that once someone had a
particular preferred way of
doing something, they would

00:07:59.546-->00:08:06.052
stick to it. They wouldn't
really change it. Now that seems
fairly obvious. Uh my first

00:08:06.052-->00:08:10.590
degree was in English lit and I
pretty much discovered after the
first 3 weeks of the first term,

00:08:10.590-->00:08:14.828
I could pretty much just make it
up. Um so that's what I did for
the next three years, um and

00:08:14.828-->00:08:18.431
then apparently in science you
actually have to provide
evidence and actually prove

00:08:18.431-->00:08:23.636
things. Um you can't just kinda
say this is obvious. [scattered
laughs] Academics tend to frown

00:08:23.636-->00:08:28.174
on that uh surprisingly. So I
wanted a way to kind of
empirically test this

00:08:28.174-->00:08:33.313
assumption. And I came across
this thing called case linkage
analysis. So it's uh a

00:08:33.313-->00:08:38.518
methodology found in crime
science. Uh so crime science is
a discipline, it's kinda of a

00:08:38.518-->00:08:44.758
multidisciplinary approach to
looking at um how crimes can be
prevented. So it's distinct from

00:08:44.758-->00:08:49.295
criminology. Criminology is
looking at why people commit
crimes, crime science is looking

00:08:49.295-->00:08:54.367
at um uh if you have uh series
of crimes being committed, for
instance, what kind of

00:08:54.367-->00:08:59.806
interventions could you put in
place to try and stop that? So
CLA case linkage analysis is

00:08:59.806-->00:09:05.311
designed to link separate crimes
to a common offender based on
behaviors exhibited during the

00:09:05.311-->00:09:11.651
commission of an offense. So the
benefits of doing this, um you
might not know who the

00:09:11.651-->00:09:15.889
individual is that's committed
this linked offenses, but you
can potentially investigate

00:09:15.889-->00:09:21.060
offenses as a series, so all
together so you can focus
resources. Uh it can be used

00:09:21.060-->00:09:26.900
evidentially. And there's also
this uh speculation that a
minority of offenders commit the

00:09:26.900-->00:09:31.771
majority of crimes. That's uh in
terms of crimes generally,
that's um debatable. But

00:09:31.771-->00:09:36.776
potentially with more specialist
crimes it's it's more accurate.
So if you want to try and link 2

00:09:38.845-->00:09:42.849
separate crimes to a common
offender, regardless if you know
who that offender is, the the

00:09:42.849-->00:09:46.853
best way to do that is through
physical evidence, DNA,
fingerprints, that kind of

00:09:46.853-->00:09:52.525
thing. Um the problem with that
approach is that evidence just
might not be there um or

00:09:52.525-->00:09:57.931
depending on the crime type, it
might not apply. So with uh with
network intrusion attacks,

00:09:57.931-->00:10:02.936
cyberattacks, for instance,
you're not going to have
physical evidence in most cases.

00:10:02.936-->00:10:07.507
You might have kinda forensic
artifacts but they're not going
to be uh unique in the same way

00:10:07.507-->00:10:11.911
that DNA or fingerprints are.
They may not take you back to a
specific individual either. So

00:10:11.911-->00:10:18.017
as an alternative, what you can
do is use um behavioral
evidence. So very specific, very

00:10:18.017-->00:10:24.924
granular things that an offender
does during the commission of a
crime. Uh either um in order to

00:10:24.924-->00:10:31.130
perpetrate the offense or to
prepare for the offense or
something that they do that's uh

00:10:31.130-->00:10:37.337
coincidental to the offense. So
the uh basic methodology is you
classify those behaviors into 7

00:10:37.337-->00:10:43.643
behavioral domains uh and you
create uh pairs of crimes and
you compare those 2 crimes

00:10:43.643-->00:10:48.648
together in terms of the
behaviors that were exhibited.
And then you try and determine a

00:10:48.648-->00:10:54.854
statistical degree of similarity
between them. So it's not
offender profiling. Um that's uh

00:10:54.854-->00:11:01.161
a very common misconception. So
offender profiling seeks to make
an interference on someone based

00:11:01.161-->00:11:05.164
on the assumption that what they
do in the commission of a crime
is going to be the same as what

00:11:05.164-->00:11:10.203
they do in every everyday life.
So uh if you were looking at a
particular crime, you could say

00:11:10.203-->00:11:16.376
based on those, I infer that the
perpetrator is uh um a boring
but very charismatic research

00:11:16.376-->00:11:21.381
from the UK , no one specific in
mind, and uh case linkage
analysis on the other hand, it

00:11:23.516-->00:11:29.389
trying to make a statistical
inference of the similarity of 2
or more crimes based on

00:11:29.389-->00:11:34.394
behaviors uh exhibited during
both of them. So in this case,
you might look at crime A, you

00:11:34.394-->00:11:39.465
know who's committed that, and
it's gt various features in
common with crime B, therefore

00:11:39.465-->00:11:44.470
crime A and crime B may have
been committed by the same
person. So CLA has uh 2 main

00:11:47.407-->00:11:52.412
assumptions at the root of it.
Um that come out of personality
psychology. So this behavioral

00:11:52.412-->00:11:57.250
consistency, the assumption that
someone uh who has committed
crimes is gonna continue to

00:11:57.250-->00:12:02.388
commit crimes in the same way
across the series of time,
across time. Um and then there's

00:12:02.388-->00:12:08.261
behavioral distinctiveness. So
the way an offender commits a
particular crime is going to be

00:12:08.261-->00:12:14.100
uh distinguishable from the way
that other people commit crime.
And both of these have to be

00:12:14.100-->00:12:18.938
present otherwise CLA doesn't
really work. Um so uh I'll talk
about this a bit later but

00:12:18.938-->00:12:23.276
certain crimes are more suited
to CLA analysis than others. So
if you look at something like

00:12:23.276-->00:12:29.148
homicide for instance, uh
homicide uh uh a very common
characteristic of that is

00:12:29.148-->00:12:33.820
dumping a body in a remote
location. So that's consistent
for many offenders but it's not

00:12:33.820-->00:12:38.825
distinctive enough to be able to
use that uh as grounds for for
CLA. So talking a bit more about

00:12:42.295-->00:12:47.634
personality psychology, uh
there's been uh various papers
on the way people respond to

00:12:47.634-->00:12:54.440
things, the fact that the way we
respond to stimuli uh is unique
or uh distinctive at least, and

00:12:54.440-->00:13:00.446
stable across time because it's
based on our upbringing and our
education and our previous

00:13:00.446-->00:13:05.685
experiences. So uh Michel and
Shoda talk about something
called CAPS, the cognitive

00:13:05.685-->00:13:10.023
personality system uh which
basically says that every
individual has their own system

00:13:10.023-->00:13:15.028
of reacting to things of
expectations and strategies uh
which is consistent yet

00:13:17.096-->00:13:22.101
distinctive. And this uh these
assumptions made in other fields
are the similar fields around

00:13:24.637-->00:13:28.041
the kind of concept of human
side channels. So if you look at
something like forensic

00:13:28.041-->00:13:32.812
linguistics for instance, uh
which is based on the assumption
that people have a stable yet

00:13:32.812-->00:13:38.551
distinctive uh writing style and
a way of uh formulating
sentences are kinda predictable,

00:13:38.551-->00:13:44.157
um uh average sentence length,
syllable count, uh structuring
of paragraphs, that kind of

00:13:44.157-->00:13:49.162
thing. Um and it applies to some
biometrics or kind of pseudo
biometric methods as well, so

00:13:51.330-->00:13:58.071
you may have heard um of some
researchers um proposing that
typing speed or typing style be

00:13:58.071-->00:14:01.874
used as an additional
authenticating system. So as
well as a password, you also

00:14:01.874-->00:14:06.879
have uh, you know, the speed at
which someone times in addition
to that. So does it actually

00:14:09.015-->00:14:14.587
work? Well the consensus in the
literature is yes, in most cases
uh so it's been applied to a

00:14:14.587-->00:14:20.893
wide number of crime types, to
burglary, arson, uh homicide,
motor vehicle crime, um and

00:14:20.893-->00:14:25.898
various others as well. So the
uh methodology. If you want to
apply CLA to something, what do

00:14:28.034-->00:14:32.739
you do? So you separate
behaviors into particular
domains, you calculate a

00:14:32.739-->00:14:38.444
similarity coefficient. Um which
is a kinda coarse measure of the
similarity between the 2 crimes

00:14:38.444-->00:14:43.182
you're looking at. You input
that into a logistic regression
model, uh regression model, and

00:14:43.182-->00:14:46.719
then you determine the optimal
combination of domains. So of
all domains you're looking at,

00:14:46.719-->00:14:51.524
which are the uh best ones for
predictive accuracy and then you
use something called receiving

00:14:51.524-->00:14:55.828
operating characteristic curves,
which are just a further measure
of predictive accuracy, they're

00:14:55.828-->00:15:01.801
kind of um they plot the
probability of a true positive
against a false positive. Now as

00:15:01.801-->00:15:07.039
a former uh literature student,
I hate statistics, I'm not very
good at statistics, so I'm going

00:15:07.039-->00:15:11.077
to try and explain this uh,
first the way I wish it had been
explained to me when I first

00:15:11.077-->00:15:14.781
started looking at this but
we're the sort of people who
have no no stats experience at

00:15:14.781-->00:15:20.219
all. I will try and walk you
through so. Say we have 2
burglaries, burglary A and

00:15:20.219-->00:15:24.457
burglary B, and we want to find
out if the same offender did
both. We want to find out the

00:15:24.457-->00:15:29.762
probability that uh 1 uh
offender did both. So the first
thing we do is define something

00:15:29.762-->00:15:35.034
called a dichotomous dependent
variable. That basically means
it's just a yes no question and

00:15:35.034-->00:15:39.305
it's the question that we're
trying to answer. So in this
case it would be, are these 2

00:15:39.305-->00:15:44.577
burglaries linked? Uh and what
we want to find out is of those
behavioral domains we have,

00:15:44.577-->00:15:49.582
which of them contribute more to
linkage or or or not being
linked? So these behavioral

00:15:52.518-->00:15:58.024
domains, what do they look like
while they? Well an example
would be entry behaviors, so for

00:15:58.024-->00:16:03.229
burglary you would look at um
how a burglar um enters the
property, what tools they use to

00:16:03.229-->00:16:08.267
do that, time of day, you uh
separate domain might be
property behaviors. SOo you look

00:16:08.267-->00:16:13.673
at what property was taken, what
property was damaged. That kind
of thing. All of these together

00:16:13.673-->00:16:18.778
are independent variables and we
make these dichotomous as well.
So we turn these into yes no

00:16:18.778-->00:16:25.685
questions. So was uh was a
crowbar used, was a screwdriver
used, that kind of thing. Then

00:16:25.685-->00:16:29.989
we apply the similarity
coefficient. So in the uh
literature, we got in case

00:16:29.989-->00:16:34.260
linkage analysis, uh the most
common one used is called
Jaccard's similarity

00:16:34.260-->00:16:38.798
coefficient. Uh this is the
formula for it, you can see it's
pretty basic. So you take

00:16:38.798-->00:16:43.836
account of uh each individual
behavior um for each domain
that's present in both of the

00:16:43.836-->00:16:49.041
offenses, you then look at uh
behaviors present in crime A but
not crime B and then the inverse

00:16:49.041-->00:16:54.680
of that and then you end up with
uh a figure once you've run it
through this formula. So if you

00:16:54.680-->00:16:59.118
get a result, 1, that means the
crimes are perfectly similar, uh
zero means they're perfectly

00:16:59.118-->00:17:05.825
dissimilar, um now crucially
Jaccard's ignores something
called joint non-occurrences so

00:17:05.825-->00:17:10.796
if a behavior didn't happen in
either crime it's not taken into
account when calculating that

00:17:10.796-->00:17:15.635
coefficient. Now that's a
concern when you're looking at
real-world crime. So like

00:17:15.635-->00:17:19.105
burglary or or where's there's
been uh some sort of kind of
interaction with the victim

00:17:19.105-->00:17:23.075
because victims don't always
accurately report what's
happened and the police don't

00:17:23.075-->00:17:27.880
always accurately report what's
happened. Um it's less of a
concern in this case as you'll

00:17:27.880-->00:17:33.486
see because we're gonna
basically record everything. So
you put each of those

00:17:33.486-->00:17:39.592
coefficients into a uh direct
logistic regression model. Um so
a logistic regression is a a way

00:17:39.592-->00:17:44.730
to perform a kind of predictive
analysis. So you want to find
out to what extent a particular

00:17:44.730-->00:17:50.503
variable contributes to an
outcome. So you'd want to look
at if there's a similarity in

00:17:50.503-->00:17:56.642
the entry behaviors to what an
extent does that predict whether
or not those 2 burglaries are

00:17:56.642-->00:18:01.948
linked. And logistic regression
also gives us some information;
it tells us uh whether a

00:18:01.948-->00:18:06.218
particular variable is
positively correlated with the
outcome, so whether it it has

00:18:06.218-->00:18:10.423
actual contributed to it,
whether it is negatively
correlated, so whether it's uh

00:18:10.423-->00:18:15.428
produced the opposite result. Um
and it gives us a P-value. So uh
in scientific experiences

00:18:18.130-->00:18:22.501
P-value is very important. It
basically tells you that the
profitability of seeing a

00:18:22.501-->00:18:29.308
particular result if the null
hypothesis is true. So a null
hypothesis uh is um the uh

00:18:29.308-->00:18:34.313
assumption that the 2 things
you're looking at are not in any
way related. So the lower the

00:18:34.313-->00:18:38.417
P-value the better. So would run
these for each behavioral
domain, you then run something

00:18:38.417-->00:18:42.788
called forward stepwise logistic
regression. Uh this is where
you're trying to workout the

00:18:42.788-->00:18:47.660
optimal combination of
behavioral domains. So you start
with 1, you add another domain

00:18:47.660-->00:18:53.899
at each step, you do different
combinations. If it contributes
to the predictive power you keep

00:18:53.899-->00:19:00.539
it, otherwise you get rid of it.
And then finally you put those
results into uh ROC curves. So

00:19:00.539-->00:19:05.778
as I mentioned, ROC curves are a
graphical representation of the
probability of a false positive

00:19:05.778-->00:19:10.383
against the probability of a
true positive. And it it kinda
gives you a more reliable

00:19:10.383-->00:19:14.720
measure than the logistic
regression of the predictive
accuracy uh the value is based

00:19:14.720-->00:19:18.891
on something called the area
under the curve. And I'll show
you an example of what I mean by

00:19:18.891-->00:19:23.629
that in a second. Uh it it also
overcomes a various statistical
issues of using logistic

00:19:23.629-->00:19:28.234
regression, in particular
context, which isn't very
interesting um but it basically

00:19:28.234-->00:19:33.239
is a measure of the overall
predictive accuracy. So this is
an example of a ROC curve. Um so

00:19:35.508-->00:19:40.246
uh what you're essentially
looking at there is the
graphical representation of true

00:19:40.246-->00:19:46.118
positive versus false positive.
Uh if you have a diagonal line
um across the graph, that

00:19:46.118-->00:19:50.623
basically means your model is
performing no better than
chance. Um the more area that's

00:19:50.623-->00:19:56.495
under the curve, the better
predictive accuracy your model
has. So um a kinda

00:19:56.495-->00:20:01.634
categorization has been
suggested is if you have an AUC
value of 0 point 5 to 0 point 7

00:20:01.634-->00:20:07.073
that's pretty low accuracy, 0
point 7 to 0 point 9 is good,
and then anything above 0 point

00:20:07.073-->00:20:12.078
9 is high. So there are some um
exceptions to the effectiveness
of case linkage analysis, as I

00:20:15.247-->00:20:19.151
mentioned homicide earlier. Uh
there's also the issue,
obviously this isn't going to be

00:20:19.151-->00:20:24.390
a100 percent guarantee to work
um some offenders will show more
distinctiveness than others. Um

00:20:24.390-->00:20:30.396
some offenders will show less
stability than others. So
certain behaviors as well within

00:20:30.396-->00:20:34.800
a particular offense will be
less consistent. Uh so for
instance, um particularly those

00:20:34.800-->00:20:40.106
uh offender doesn't have control
over. So property stolen during
a burglary for instance, the

00:20:40.106-->00:20:43.576
offender is not going to be able
to control that um to some
extent because they don't know

00:20:43.576-->00:20:48.581
necessarily what's in the
property. There's also the issue
uh that an offender's MO is a

00:20:50.950-->00:20:55.688
learned behavior. So it's going
to develop over time as uh
offenders speak to other

00:20:55.688-->00:21:00.893
offenders, as, you know, new
technologies come out and new
practices come out. And

00:21:00.893-->00:21:07.333
crucially, they also change
their behaviors in response to
events. So this is why CLA is uh

00:21:07.333-->00:21:12.338
more effective which have less
victims interaction. Uh because
if you take something uh like a

00:21:14.840-->00:21:20.813
robbery, for instance, um where
an offender is threatening or
using violence against someone,

00:21:20.813-->00:21:25.351
then the victim's response to
the offender doing that will
then potentially influence the

00:21:25.351-->00:21:31.924
offender's behaviors. Uh and
then uh most research with CLA
has only be applied to solved

00:21:31.924-->00:21:36.495
crimes, they've been relatively
small samples as well and
typically it's only been looking

00:21:36.495-->00:21:41.500
at serial offenses. So I want to
talk to you now about the uh
experiment I did. Um so I wanted

00:21:43.536-->00:21:49.275
to find out if CLA could be
applied to cyberattacks, uh
specifically in a situation

00:21:49.275-->00:21:54.346
where the attackers has got code
execution on a machine. Um so
this hasn't been done before.

00:21:54.346-->00:22:00.386
CLA has only previously been
applied to real-world crimes um
so what I wanted to do was take

00:22:00.386-->00:22:04.823
very granular behaviors, so an
attacker's keystrokes and the
commands they're executing and

00:22:04.823-->00:22:09.728
the syntax they're using, and
the order of switches on
commands, uh and work out if

00:22:09.728-->00:22:14.567
that could be used as kinda of
an attack signature to link
together an attack committed by

00:22:14.567-->00:22:19.572
the same offender. So when um
designing this experiment, the
uh kinda of common approach in

00:22:23.275-->00:22:28.681
the literature is to use police
data, uh crime reports. Uh the
issue with that as I mentioned

00:22:28.681-->00:22:32.718
earlier, they may be inaccurate,
they may be incomplete, um
victim accounts may be

00:22:32.718-->00:22:37.456
inaccurate um because triumph-
crimes are often traumatic and
trauma can uh distort memory,

00:22:37.456-->00:22:43.229
that kind of thing, it's a also
a problem that police may not
record all data. And when you're

00:22:43.229-->00:22:47.233
talking about network intrusion
attacks, uh it's unlikely that
crime reports gonna have the

00:22:47.233-->00:22:54.206
level of granularity needed uh
in this instance. Another
possible approach was using a

00:22:54.206-->00:23:00.479
Honeypot. So um, you know,
exposing an SSH server with a
weak password and just kind of

00:23:00.479-->00:23:05.751
sniffing what was coming in and
then logging keystrokes. The
issue with that is because this

00:23:05.751-->00:23:11.423
this methodology was previously
untested for cyberattacks, I
needed a kind of ground truth. I

00:23:11.423-->00:23:15.527
needed to know what attacks were
linked and what weren't. Um
there's also the problem that

00:23:15.527-->00:23:21.700
even if I did get um someone
attacking, say 2 servers and
trying to match them together.

00:23:21.700-->00:23:26.839
Even if they come the same IP
address doesn't guarantee that
it's the same individual behind

00:23:26.839-->00:23:32.611
the keyboard. I'd also need to
distinguish between bots and
humans, which is uh an exercise

00:23:32.611-->00:23:37.249
in itself. And there's also the
issue that Honeypots can be
fingerprinted, which may um

00:23:37.249-->00:23:42.254
influence an attacker's
behavior. So I took um a. open
source SSH key logger, written

00:23:46.025-->00:23:52.498
in Python, um the user strace to
log keystrokes process, um span
up to virtual machines, uh

00:23:52.498-->00:23:58.837
expose them to the internet over
SSH, configured 1 account per
user per books, uh there are 10

00:23:58.837-->00:24:03.676
users in total. Uh configured
each one with uh deliberate
privilege escalation

00:24:03.676-->00:24:08.447
vulnerabilities and then put
some tasty looking data on there
for attackers to exfiltrate. I

00:24:08.447-->00:24:14.253
got uh 10 volunteers to
participate, so a mixture of
pentesters, and uh enthusiasts,

00:24:14.253-->00:24:19.258
and students. Uh I entered SSH
into both machines so they had a
low privilege shell. Uh I asked

00:24:21.994-->00:24:27.266
them to try and escalate their
privileges, to steal data, uh to
try and cover their tracks, and

00:24:27.266-->00:24:31.603
generally just kinda poke around
the file system and see what was
there. Uh and while they were

00:24:31.603-->00:24:38.210
doing that, I was recording all
of their keystrokes using this
keylogger. So the hypothesis was

00:24:38.210-->00:24:43.749
that um as attackers are doing
that um they will be consistent
and distinctive in the same way

00:24:43.749-->00:24:49.054
that other offenders are with
other crimes, which will enable
me to try and link together 2

00:24:49.054-->00:24:54.059
separate offenses committed by
the same attacker. So I ended up
with 3 behavioral domains: uh

00:24:56.261-->00:25:02.067
navigation, uh which is how
attackers are moving through the
file system; uh enumeration, the

00:25:02.067-->00:25:06.271
kind of local reconnaissance on
that system; and then
exploitation, which covered both

00:25:06.271-->00:25:12.911
privilege escalation attempts
and exfiltration attempts. I
also look at 3 metadata

00:25:12.911-->00:25:17.783
variables, so um these are not
behavioral um but they are
looking at the number of

00:25:17.783-->00:25:21.153
milliseconds between each
keystroke. The number of
milliseconds between each

00:25:21.153-->00:25:26.792
command, and then the number of
backspaces uh expressed as a
percentage of all keystrokes. So

00:25:26.792-->00:25:30.729
these metadata variables,
obviously none dichotomous,
they're not yes-no answers,

00:25:30.729-->00:25:35.734
they're just values. Uh the
reason I chose to do that is
that in other CLA work in

00:25:37.836-->00:25:42.808
addition to that behavioral um
uh granular behavior uh domains,
people have also looked at

00:25:42.808-->00:25:47.846
things like intercrime distance,
temporal proximity, uh that's
kind of had some promising

00:25:47.846-->00:25:53.452
results as well. Uh previous
research has also looked at
things like commands typed per

00:25:53.452-->00:25:57.823
second, which potentially has
issues because that's gonna be
influenced by the the length of

00:25:57.823-->00:26:04.563
the command time to complete,
and that kind of thing. So these
are some examples of the kind of

00:26:04.563-->00:26:09.301
behaviors that I was looking at
uh once these uh volunteers had
finished. Um so you can see

00:26:09.301-->00:26:14.473
they're pretty granular. Um
there are um subtle distinctions
between some of them. So you

00:26:14.473-->00:26:18.510
have navigation behaviors are
the the first 2 columns on the
left and then the 2 columns on

00:26:18.510-->00:26:23.515
the right are uh exploitation
behaviors. So uh on average,
each participation spent about

00:26:27.920-->00:26:32.925
uh 2 hours, just over 2 hours uh
on each host, issuing an average
of 243 commands on each host. 2

00:26:35.194-->00:26:41.567
of them got root on the first VM
and one of them got root on the
second. So 10 attackers, 2

00:26:41.567-->00:26:46.972
machines, 100 crime pairs, uh of
which 10 were linked and 90 were
unlinked. So what I did was

00:26:46.972-->00:26:53.612
compare each attack against the
first VM uh against each against
on the second VM. Uh calculated

00:26:53.612-->00:26:59.051
the similarity coefficient, uh
automatically using a tool I
wrote, um that gave me a CSV

00:26:59.051-->00:27:05.290
file, so here are the similarity
coefficients. Um so you can see
if you look at the first column,

00:27:05.290-->00:27:11.463
which is the mean average um and
compare it to the um the
variables. You can see that link

00:27:11.463-->00:27:17.569
defenses have a much higher mean
similarity coefficient than
unlinked defenses, which uh is

00:27:17.569-->00:27:22.574
promising to start with. For the
metadata variables, again if you
look at that mean column, you

00:27:25.244-->00:27:29.982
can see that linked offenses
have slightly lower values um
than unlinked offenses, which

00:27:29.982-->00:27:34.653
again is promising because
you're looking at um things like
the uh similarity between the uh

00:27:34.653-->00:27:39.658
total keystrokes and that kind
of thing. So then I reported the
results of that into a package

00:27:42.094-->00:27:48.600
called SPSS, which I'm not I
don't like um as you might be
able to tell. Um and I performed

00:27:48.600-->00:27:53.472
direct logistic regression for
each of those behavioral domains
and then forwards stepwise

00:27:53.472-->00:27:59.745
logistic regression. So that uh
resulted in 6 models in total
and then a seventh model which

00:27:59.745-->00:28:04.683
was uh the optimal combination
of each domain. So this is a
slide you've all been waiting

00:28:07.152-->00:28:12.157
for very patiently. [scattered
laughter, claps, and whistles]
So yeah uh. [laughter and

00:28:18.797-->00:28:23.802
applause] Thank you, yeah. I had
a backup. I genuinely wasn't uh
thinking that was going to get

00:28:30.008-->00:28:35.147
applause, so I watched a lot of
uh black hat DefCon talks uh in
the last couple of years. So I

00:28:35.147-->00:28:39.284
put something in the next slide
which I think is probably uh
statistically guaranteed to get

00:28:39.284-->00:28:44.289
me a round of applause.
[laughter and applause] Okay so
that big table that I showed

00:28:52.197-->00:28:57.903
you, what does it tell us? It
tells us that those 3 behavioral
domains uh are able to classify

00:28:57.903-->00:29:02.407
linked and unlinked offenses uh
with a very high level of
accuracy. Uh and I'll show some

00:29:02.407-->00:29:08.847
more of the results a bit later.
It's a bit easier to see. The um
upshot of all this is navigation

00:29:08.847-->00:29:14.686
is the most effective predictor,
um then exploitation, then
enumeration uh with a really

00:29:14.686-->00:29:21.560
strong correlation to the
outcome of linked or unlinked.
The uh metadata variable was

00:29:21.560-->00:29:26.431
much less successful. So
keystroke and command intervals
not reliable at all. Uh

00:29:26.431-->00:29:32.237
backspaces uh percentage of
backspaces a very weak negative
correlation um but not

00:29:32.237-->00:29:36.508
statistically significant. So
that p-value that I mentioned
earlier uh was pretty higher for

00:29:36.508-->00:29:41.513
them, uh so you can't really um
count that as a result. So then
um I put these values into ROC

00:29:44.383-->00:29:48.887
curves, uh and these are the
results. So the uh column to
focus on or the 2 columns to

00:29:48.887-->00:29:54.760
focus on are the AUC column and
the Sig. column. So Sig. is the
p-value, AUC is the area under

00:29:54.760-->00:29:58.864
the curve. Remember the closer
we are to 1, the greater
predictive accuracy this has

00:29:58.864-->00:30:03.702
has, this has got. So you can
see the first 3 behavioral
domains are very high um

00:30:03.702-->00:30:09.241
navigation 0 point 992 is the
best, and exploitation 0 point
964, then enumeration 0 point

00:30:09.241-->00:30:15.280
912. Uh as you can see the
metadata variables um keystroke
interval and command interval

00:30:15.280-->00:30:20.852
didn't really perform any better
than chance. Uh backspaces were
okay, 0 point 7, so it's a kind

00:30:20.852-->00:30:25.857
of uh you know, it's it's a
medium level of accuracy. So 0
point 992 is great um now I've

00:30:30.796-->00:30:35.801
put that on there um because the
cool kids told me that Jay Z is
a ROC fella um which uh [light

00:30:39.137-->00:30:44.276
laughter] I assume means he's
got an interest in inferential
statistics and predictive

00:30:44.276-->00:30:49.548
accuracies. [light laughter] So
these are the ROC curve results
just to um to reiterate. So the

00:30:49.548-->00:30:54.119
optimal model uh in this
particular study at least, if
you combine navigation and

00:30:54.119-->00:30:58.690
enumeration, you got predictive
accuracy of 100 percent. Now I'm
suspicious of anything that's

00:30:58.690-->00:31:04.196
100 percent. Um and I'll come on
to the kind of caveat of this
research and kinda of thresh the

00:31:04.196-->00:31:10.602
validity uh towards the end. So
uh what are the implications of
this? What does this actually

00:31:10.602-->00:31:16.241
mean? Well it means that um
potentially cyberattacks,
network intrusion attacks, where

00:31:16.241-->00:31:22.214
an attacker has command
execution through an interactive
shell um potentially has high

00:31:22.214-->00:31:28.453
levels of consistency and
distinctiveness. Um particularly
with navigation and enumeration,

00:31:28.453-->00:31:33.859
um a theory I have around why
navigation particularly was so
useful is that it's something

00:31:33.859-->00:31:39.131
that we do every day. Okay so.
Uh whether we're using our own
computers assuming, we use

00:31:39.131-->00:31:43.635
Linux, which is what this one
was, uh and which uh I believe
most of the participants who

00:31:43.635-->00:31:47.773
took part in this study do, um
it's just something you do out
of habit. Whereas things like

00:31:47.773-->00:31:51.977
enumeration and exploitation,
you only really gonna do that
when you're actually attacking a

00:31:51.977-->00:31:56.982
host. Uh the worst high levels
of accuracy that have been
reported for other crime types

00:32:00.318-->00:32:05.590
in terms of the CLA literature,
um and a possible reason again
for this would be that the

00:32:05.590-->00:32:10.896
behaviors exhibited in this kind
of uh attack, this kind of
crime, are less subject to

00:32:10.896-->00:32:17.402
influence um so there aren't any
victims directly involved
necessarily, um offenders may

00:32:17.402-->00:32:22.507
kind of change um some of their
approach depending on, you know,
security mechanisms in place, um

00:32:22.507-->00:32:27.979
that kind of thing. But
generally their granular command
choice is not really gonna

00:32:27.979-->00:32:33.685
differ. It's gonna be quite
difficult to uh to influence
that. The metadata variables, uh

00:32:33.685-->00:32:40.225
not as good at all. Um
suggesting that what you type is
much better for trying to link

00:32:40.225-->00:32:45.597
crimes than how you type. Uh now
with the uh intervals, the
keystroke intervals and command

00:32:45.597-->00:32:50.335
intervals, network latency may
have affected some of the
results and skewed them. Um but

00:32:50.335-->00:32:53.738
the mistakes and typos
potentially show some promise
and maybe that's worth a bit of

00:32:53.738-->00:32:59.845
further research. Uh does need
some some further exploration.
So uh the implications for

00:32:59.845-->00:33:05.784
investigators are that you can
potentially link separate
offenses to common offenders

00:33:05.784-->00:33:10.188
regardless of whether or not you
know who that offender is. Uh
without having to rely on atomic

00:33:10.188-->00:33:17.128
IOCs or computed IOCs. But you
do need a lot of information. So
um you need to get as granular

00:33:17.128-->00:33:21.533
as possible. You essentially
need to be in a position to
capture commands and keystrokes.

00:33:21.533-->00:33:26.638
So the easiest way to do that
would be with something like a
high interaction Honeypot, um

00:33:26.638-->00:33:31.476
assuming that um the attacker is
not going to become aware that
they're on a Honeypot, which

00:33:31.476-->00:33:35.780
would then could then kind of
influence rthe esults. Um you
could try and do with just

00:33:35.780-->00:33:42.020
really verbose logging and look
at aspects other than keystrokes
and commands. Um you could also

00:33:42.020-->00:33:46.258
um use something like a
backdoors CTF if you wanted to
try and do that or vulnerable

00:33:46.258-->00:33:51.529
VMs or something. And
potentially, you could try and
link attackers who trained

00:33:51.529-->00:33:55.433
together or who have been
trained by the same person or
who have done the same kind of

00:33:55.433-->00:34:01.473
qualification. Um now that kind
of does dilute this assumption
that everyone has a distinctive

00:34:01.473-->00:34:06.211
ways of doing things, um but it
could still assist and that's uh
something that I want to look at

00:34:06.211-->00:34:12.517
uh going forward. Now there are
implications for privacy here
was well. Um in that you could

00:34:12.517-->00:34:16.688
potentially be linked to
separate hosts or separate
identities just based on the way

00:34:16.688-->00:34:21.526
you type, regardless of what
other measures you have in place
and how good your OPSEC is. Just

00:34:21.526-->00:34:25.563
the way you structure commands
and use command switches and
syntax could potentially

00:34:25.563-->00:34:31.803
influence um that and could lead
to you being linked to uh to
other things. So like uh

00:34:31.803-->00:34:36.808
forensic linguistics, the whole
concept of this is exploiting
stable, behavioral traits. Uh

00:34:39.244-->00:34:43.315
and as I mentioned it it
shouldn't be a 100 percent
accurate um and potentially

00:34:43.315-->00:34:48.920
affect less of the population,
so forensic linguistics will uh
effect everyone who is literate,

00:34:48.920-->00:34:55.026
this would effect much less
people. Um and this study only
focused on commands um that

00:34:55.026-->00:34:59.397
attackers were entering. You
could kinda of widen this to
look at more general typing

00:34:59.397-->00:35:04.336
behaviors. Um so things that
people do on keyboards that
aren't necessarily um the actual

00:35:04.336-->00:35:08.473
text that they're typing, but
just kind of around that, how
they kinda of, you know,

00:35:08.473-->00:35:15.180
navigate through a document,
that type of thing. So if
someone's in a position to log

00:35:15.180-->00:35:19.985
your keystrokes, you've got
pretty big issues anyway. And uh
if someone wants to try and

00:35:19.985-->00:35:25.190
identify you then they're going
to do that without going to this
kind of length of uh of uh

00:35:25.190-->00:35:29.728
bother, but this is more about
attribution via linkage. So what
this means is that you could be

00:35:29.728-->00:35:34.733
linked t historical or future
activity that might be done
under a different pseudonym or a

00:35:34.733-->00:35:41.706
different identity. So how could
you defeat it? Um well it's
pretty similar just trying to

00:35:41.706-->00:35:46.711
defeat forensic linguistics,
trying to defeat authorship
identification. You really want

00:35:46.711-->00:35:53.284
to try and consciously disguise
the way that you're um you're
approaching a particular task.

00:35:53.284-->00:35:57.022
Now with forensic linguistics,
uh there are various solutions
that have been proposed, from

00:35:57.022-->00:36:01.226
the very crude, such as putting
stuff through Google Translate a
number of times to the very

00:36:01.226-->00:36:05.597
sophisticated, where you're
actually kind of swapping out
punctuation and you're kind of

00:36:05.597-->00:36:09.701
randomly putting punctuation
different places. And there have
been uh talks about that before

00:36:09.701-->00:36:14.606
and studies on that before. Uh
CLA is slightly different. So
trying to do this in an

00:36:14.606-->00:36:19.577
automatic way is gonna be pretty
difficult um because you can't
really predict the commands um

00:36:19.577-->00:36:24.916
that you're gonna use in
advance. You could try and kinda
of semi-automate it I guess. So

00:36:24.916-->00:36:29.020
uh talking bout Google Translate
and uh forensic linguistic.
There's a quick sidebar, I

00:36:29.020-->00:36:34.592
wanted to talk about this
because I think this is really
cool. So this is a bot that my

00:36:34.592-->00:36:38.163
colleague Keith Short created
called InsightfulRobot. And it
takes famous quotes from books

00:36:38.163-->00:36:42.867
and films and it runs them
through Google Translate uh 13
times and then tweets the answer

00:36:42.867-->00:36:48.573
um at 10 a.m. every day. So it's
just kinda an illustration of
how badly Google Translate kinda

00:36:48.573-->00:36:52.710
mangles the the sense of what
you're trying to say. I thought
I'd have a go at this as well.

00:36:52.710-->00:36:59.284
So uh this is uh a line of text
I put into it. I translated it
uh 6 times to various language,

00:36:59.284-->00:37:03.221
ended up with that. Uh which
obviously bears kind of no
resemblance to what I was

00:37:03.221-->00:37:09.761
initially uh saying. So
conscious changes, manual
changes are probably the best

00:37:09.761-->00:37:13.832
way to do it. Um so you could do
things like randomize the
ordering of commands which if

00:37:13.832-->00:37:18.169
you had multiple switches on a
particular command. You could
try and switch up tools, so you

00:37:18.169-->00:37:22.974
could use wget instead of curl,
you could use vi instead of
nano, although that might start

00:37:22.974-->00:37:27.979
a war, kind of uh saying that.
Um so I mentioned earlier
threats to validity, so this was

00:37:30.115-->00:37:34.886
a very small sample of people It
was only 10 people. Um because
this has never been done before,

00:37:34.886-->00:37:38.690
because kind of limited time
resources, that kind of thing.
So it's very much a proof of

00:37:38.690-->00:37:45.196
concepts, there wasn't
real-world data for the the
reasons I explained previously.

00:37:45.196-->00:37:48.700
There's also the fact that the
participants were volunteers.
And they knew they were

00:37:48.700-->00:37:53.138
participating in an academic
experiment. They knew they had
permission to attack those

00:37:53.138-->00:37:58.510
machines with no fear of
reprisal. It was also Linux
only. And I only looked at one

00:37:58.510-->00:38:03.481
scenario so remote access over
SSH to a low privilege shell.
And crucially, there's also the

00:38:03.481-->00:38:08.253
point that I asked those
participants to try and escalate
privileges and exfiltrate stuff.

00:38:08.253-->00:38:12.590
And in the world, attackers
might not always want or need to
escalate their privileges,

00:38:12.590-->00:38:17.595
depending on what their
objective is. So to sum up then,
um there's uh a lot of future

00:38:21.199-->00:38:25.870
research I think that could be
done in this area. Um 1 would be
to look at the effect of

00:38:25.870-->00:38:31.810
expertise, the the uh the effect
the skill level has on
predictive accuracy and and uh

00:38:31.810-->00:38:37.949
linking. Temporal proximity, so
looking at an attack uh by 1
attacker now and then looking at

00:38:37.949-->00:38:43.821
it again in 6 months' time. Um
looking at real world data,
doing further research into

00:38:43.821-->00:38:49.594
those metadata variables. Um
stochastic analysis to try and
predict uh what an attacker

00:38:49.594-->00:38:56.134
might type next. Looking into
more scenario uh scenario
diversity. Um so in particular,

00:38:56.134-->00:39:01.539
uh if you can't see my black hat
talk, I talked about like false
personae online um and different

00:39:01.539-->00:39:06.578
kind of social media profiles
corporate by 1 person. This is a
potential approach to try and

00:39:06.578-->00:39:11.983
attribute different social media
profiles to 1 individual based
on the uh granular behaviors

00:39:11.983-->00:39:17.255
that are displayed during the
maintenance of that profile. Um
and then trying to automate this

00:39:17.255-->00:39:22.260
um because this took a long time
to do uh SPSS is not my friend,
so um trying to automate this

00:39:24.295-->00:39:29.734
would be really cool as well. So
do get in touch if you want to
discuss uh, here's my Twitter

00:39:29.734-->00:39:33.371
handle my email address uh if
you're interested in
collaborating or you just want

00:39:33.371-->00:39:38.877
to find out more, then let me
know. So to sum up, uh this is a
pretty small study, pretty novel

00:39:38.877-->00:39:43.381
it had never been done before.
Some promising results, um
potentially some pretty serious

00:39:43.381-->00:39:48.453
implications uh for both
investigators from an
attribution perspective, and for

00:39:48.453-->00:39:54.525
privacy. Uh does need kind of
further research and work. So uh
all the references are here in

00:39:54.525-->00:39:58.529
the slide deck that were used in
this talk. If you uh want to
have look at them, there's a

00:39:58.529-->00:40:03.134
white paper variable if you want
to have a look at that as well.
Um there's my contact details

00:40:03.134-->00:40:08.139
again if you want to get in
touch. Um and that's it from me
thank you very much. [applause]
