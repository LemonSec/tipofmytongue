00:00:00.367,00:00:27.127
>>This is Aaron Luo. [applause].
Good luck. >> Er, go –good

00:00:27.127,00:00:33.934
afternoon ladies and gentleman
and thank you for coming, I

00:00:33.934,00:00:37.738
Aaron. Today I going to talk
about drone hijacking and, er, I

00:00:37.738,00:00:47.047
going to enjoy this event. This
event is my first time

00:00:47.047,00:00:53.854
presenting in Defcon and er, er,
actually [applause], er, thanks.

00:00:53.854,00:01:01.695
Actually, I a little nervous now
because, er, you know, first

00:01:01.695,00:01:10.203
time so [laughs] and er, this is
my first time use English to

00:01:10.203,00:01:19.947
presentation. So, so, so, so,
er, I know it’s hard to decode

00:01:19.947,00:01:23.116
my English, so please bear it
and…okay… let me start with er,

00:01:23.116,00:01:27.788
brief self- introduction. Er, my
name’s Aaron as I mention

00:01:27.788,00:01:37.931
before. And er, currently I er
working in Trend Micro. Er, and

00:01:37.931,00:01:48.709
, er I come from Taiwan also,
also HIT count member, a hacker

00:01:48.709,00:01:58.585
community in Taiwan and er, this
this year he can’t also benefit,

00:01:58.585,00:02:18.705
enjoy the Defcon CTF and er, I
do want to tell a story about,

00:02:18.705,00:02:26.513
about , er, about, why,er, I
start my security research life

00:02:26.513,00:02:35.522
since 2005. Please also because
of [inaudible] deal, in my

00:02:35.522,00:02:41.762
fifteen years or so I decide to
development IT and, er, , er out

00:02:41.762,00:02:43.830
of blue or madness, I don’t know
why I decide I don’t like that,

00:02:43.830,00:02:50.003
but if only I finish the , er,
darkdoor when 16 years old, and

00:02:50.003,00:03:02.949
, er, and, er, and er, list IT
for me to remote [inaudible]

00:03:02.949,00:03:11.258
machines …. He also offer some
nice functions,er, such as you

00:03:11.258,00:03:16.263
can see if someone want to
[indistinguishable] or, or, look

00:03:16.263,00:03:26.073
some functions or see remote
desk top screen. Or, but trust

00:03:26.073,00:03:32.779
me, I just only play this
summer. I’m my own VA so no one

00:03:32.779,00:03:43.490
impact. Okay, oh sorry I
[indistinguishable] you know.

00:03:43.490,00:03:51.765
Er, after I creating the
darkdoor management web server
then I

00:03:51.765,00:03:54.901
join the Taiwan government
cybercrime investigation

00:03:54.901,00:03:59.272
department with Kang
[indistinguishable]. Then I

00:03:59.272,00:04:05.745
joined Trend Micro cyber 15
solution team so, I think the

00:04:05.745,00:04:16.223
dark door is the beginning of
everything. Okay, er, this

00:04:16.223,00:04:21.962
enough my self- introduction…..
let’s start, let’s start

00:04:21.962,00:04:28.768
hacking. This, er, this is,
today’s agenda. I will

00:04:28.768,00:04:35.208
introduc-introduce the drone
architecture and, er, and the

00:04:35.208,00:04:41.781
point of the vulnerability
component. After I will demo how

00:04:41.781,00:04:49.122
to hack it and provide, er, er,
prevention solution. The talk

00:04:49.122,00:05:03.403
will then be showing the G Hub.
Er, today our topic is… the

00:05:03.403,00:05:13.246
DJI-Phantom 3 Advanced. This,
this drone render is popular, is

00:05:13.246,00:05:20.787
popular and, er, I think the
drone architecture is a similar.

00:05:20.787,00:05:27.194
So, if you know how to, er,
exploit this drone, you may take

00:05:27.194,00:05:39.139
this same tech to hack another
drone. Okay, let’s talk about

00:05:39.139,00:05:47.447
the structure of this drone. Er,
there are three main model: er,

00:05:47.447,00:05:56.389
drone itself and the remote
controller and,er, app SDK

00:05:56.389,00:06:04.297
[indistinguishable] vulnerable
and easy to exploit. Er, I think

00:06:04.297,00:06:10.737
it’s er usually find in radio
remote controller and, er, GPS

00:06:10.737,00:06:23.650
model and, er, app SDK. First,
we, we, search for vulnerability

00:06:23.650,00:06:33.260
from TJI, TJI app and SDK. You
can see the operation process in

00:06:33.260,00:06:45.672
this image. First the TJI
develop app will makes a request

00:06:45.672,00:06:48.275
activation data from TJI
authentication server. Then the

00:06:48.275,00:06:52.779
remote controller use USB to
transmit data. Final drone,

00:06:52.779,00:07:10.330
drone will fly if can find the
activation data. Er, actually,

00:07:10.330,00:07:15.568
actually presentation is not
speciality so, so I’m really

00:07:15.568,00:07:22.475
very, er, nervous and er, er,
now I want to introduce how to

00:07:22.475,00:07:28.548
correct the SDK authentication
mechanism. First, er, we have

00:07:28.548,00:07:37.457
downloaded SDK from DJI website,
then, er, then er, this

00:07:37.457,00:07:45.865
[indistinguishable] I choose
actually SDK so it is, er, JAR

00:07:45.865,00:07:50.236
file. You can find the key
function with JDGUI and, er, I

00:07:50.236,00:07:56.776
found the function, it calls
check permission. This function

00:07:56.776,00:08:05.218
will, will be called by, by a
when you open the app, it will

00:08:05.218,00:08:08.688
call, it will call this
function. So, we just need to

00:08:08.688,00:08:14.761
patch this, er, function, then
we then we are, we know to

00:08:14.761,00:08:27.841
bypass the, the authentication
mechanism. So, how to patch this

00:08:27.841,00:08:36.016
function. Er, I think this part
is easy, you just use JBE. JBE

00:08:36.016,00:08:43.523
is a java byte code editor and
er,er, find, find, er, just

00:08:43.523,00:08:57.103
mention, er check permission
function then, then I, I replace

00:08:57.103,00:09:04.377
the check permission directory
to, to SDK level 2. It means we

00:09:04.377,00:09:14.721
can directly use the level 2
SDK, er, I forgot to tell you

00:09:14.721,00:09:23.463
about the SDK permission. Zero-
it mean you have no permission

00:09:23.463,00:09:34.074
and for SDK level above the,
bigger than zero, then it mean

00:09:34.074,00:09:43.149
you have the SDK permission so I
just save it to, to er, to, to ,

00:09:43.149,00:09:52.192
er, 2. Then return. After patch
this function you can, you can

00:09:52.192,00:09:59.165
recheck [indistinguishable]
JDGUI then you can see the SDK

00:09:59.165,00:10:10.977
level directory, return to and ,
er, this SDK is, SDK

00:10:10.977,00:10:17.817
authentication mechanism is
easier to hack but I think it is

00:10:17.817,00:10:23.022
simple but powerful because all
kind of DJI drones can be affect

00:10:23.022,00:10:37.103
by this, by this vulnerability.
Er, now I demo, I demo how to

00:10:37.103,00:10:45.445
use this, this vulnerability.
Er, at first we can… Oh sorry, I

00:10:45.445,00:11:32.158
check the video. Wait a moment.
Oh, okay, okay, thank you, thank

00:11:32.158,00:11:42.735
you. Er…er, after we crack the
SDK we can directly connect to

00:11:42.735,00:11:48.908
the app and look the camera
data. So, this, you can see the

00:11:48.908,00:12:00.320
camera so this is really work
and er…next demo I will show

00:12:00.320,00:12:05.391
how, how to use this
vulnerability to impact the

00:12:05.391,00:12:19.072
drone. Er, I develop, er, a app
by the SDK and er, this, contain

00:12:19.072,00:12:29.148
contains some er, API can be
call, like er, we can, er

00:12:29.148,00:12:37.724
take-off or landing and for this
I, I use the take-off function.

00:12:37.724,00:12:46.132
Then I press the button, the
drone just be take-off and then

00:12:46.132,00:13:10.957
I press the landing button. The
drone is landing. And, er, I

00:13:10.957,00:13:18.931
also use this feature to, er,
write a function, it can, it can

00:13:18.931,00:13:29.842
fly drone into the location we
submit [indistinguishable]. ……at

00:13:29.842,00:13:35.415
first I input the GPS location
and then I press the fly to

00:13:35.415,00:13:43.956
here, fly to there. The drone
fly to there. But actually this

00:13:43.956,00:13:54.967
SDK er, er have some , have some
limitation, er because this demo

00:13:54.967,00:14:00.973
I just use cracker a SDK, er
this, this means I, I don’t need

00:14:00.973,00:14:09.215
to to connect to the
authentication server I can

00:14:09.215,00:14:29.702
directly this, use this SDK. Er,
so how to prevent or improve

00:14:29.702,00:14:41.314
this. The vendor can protect
their library firewall by either

00:14:41.314,00:14:56.329
use obfuscator or packer. Or use
the the encry- encryption tool

00:14:56.329,00:15:00.533
to void the SDK authentication
keep between X and drone and

00:15:00.533,00:15:04.437
server now only just void the
front [indistinguishable]

00:15:04.437,00:15:28.494
server. Okay, this is intro
session, firmware, analysis. Er,

00:15:28.494,00:15:36.602
how to analysis the firmware we
can use bin walk extract some

00:15:36.602,00:15:51.751
data but actually it’s limit.
So, so, er, we we use IDA pro

00:15:51.751,00:15:59.525
tool analysis incomplete data
extracting by the bin walk. And

00:15:59.525,00:16:06.098
use string reference to find the
key function. The function

00:16:06.098,00:16:14.040
decide to check the firmware, we
can use it to reverse the

00:16:14.040,00:16:25.751
firmware format. Actually this
decode function is very big.

00:16:25.751,00:16:35.595
Please forgive me for not
explain, explain the detail.

00:16:35.595,00:16:45.304
And, er, finally we can, we can
extract each function which

00:16:45.304,00:16:50.843
contain detail information
including the measuring of ID

00:16:50.843,00:17:04.757
and module name and the binary
name. And after that I shared

00:17:04.757,00:17:27.546
the UBI file system from from
PFC300SFw3 dot bin by er, by by

00:17:27.546,00:17:38.991
using old password. And er, an
er then we can extract some

00:17:38.991,00:17:50.403
interesting things from firewall
systems. For example the SSH key

00:17:50.403,00:17:58.744
and, er, and, er some, and er
some config-configuration data.

00:17:58.744,00:18:06.586
And er, if you want to know the
loop and as well you can view

00:18:06.586,00:18:17.730
the X shot to create this file.
Okay, er, I will introduce how

00:18:17.730,00:18:25.338
to prevent or improve this this
part. Actually I think, just

00:18:25.338,00:18:31.043
increase the firmware binary but
still need ec, extra careful

00:18:31.043,00:18:38.784
about storage place must be
safety and er this side and

00:18:38.784,00:18:51.097
should careful of the side
channel attack. Okay, this is

00:18:51.097,00:19:07.680
the end of firmware analysis.
The next section is signal

00:19:07.680,00:19:09.849
analysis. How to analyze the
radio signal, er, just by the

00:19:09.849,00:19:18.157
SDR SDIs software define radio.
The two on top are hacker-Ive,

00:19:18.157,00:19:24.296
the, the bottom one is,er, blade
hive. Er, by the way, this all

00:19:24.296,00:19:31.303
available in Defcon vendor area,
so if you interesting with this

00:19:31.303,00:19:51.157
you can buy from from vendor
area. And,er, we found DJ PA 3

00:19:51.157,00:19:59.799
used two modulation/demodulation
to transfer data with 2.4GHz ISM

00:19:59.799,00:20:06.205
band. I will introduce this
detail later. One modulation is

00:20:06.205,00:20:10.876
used to control the flying
duration of drone like, er,

00:20:10.876,00:20:18.884
flying up down left or right.
You can observe it is SFHSS

00:20:18.884,00:20:29.161
frequency hopping and the
frequentation range is about two

00:20:29.161,00:20:35.367
dot four gigahertz to two dot
four eight gigahertz, and er,

00:20:35.367,00:20:45.711
each channel is about one
megahertz bandwidth. The other

00:20:45.711,00:21:01.093
modulation use DSSS,er, it is
direct frequency duration and er

00:21:01.093,00:21:08.200
it that drone to transmit images
to remote controller. The

00:21:08.200,00:21:17.443
frequency is, er, about 2 dot
forty fifteen to about two dot

00:21:17.443,00:21:22.248
forty eight fifteen gigahertz.
Each, er, channel is about ten

00:21:22.248,00:21:31.257
megahertz bandwidth. And, er,
finally we found the image has

00:21:31.257,00:21:36.896
no check sound mechanism, so we
can jamming the radio frequency

00:21:36.896,00:21:42.668
to show wrong image to
controller. Er, let’s see the

00:21:42.668,00:21:54.513
demo. This is, er, the program I
development. It can, it can

00:21:54.513,00:22:01.287
jamming, jamming the radio
signal and show blue, er, green

00:22:01.287,00:22:12.598
screen to the , to the, to the
DJI F system. And, er, how to

00:22:12.598,00:22:23.976
prevent or improve this. I think
just validate the image

00:22:23.976,00:22:30.316
checksum, if checksum is wrong
er, just don’t show this image.

00:22:30.316,00:22:37.056
Or, or you can transfer the
image data by a sound metric

00:22:37.056,00:22:46.265
encryption, but, but, it can
more performance, er, actually I

00:22:46.265,00:22:53.205
think just add er checksum is
enough because reverse

00:22:53.205,00:23:06.852
modulation / demodulation, er,
is not easy. And, er, let’s move

00:23:06.852,00:23:17.596
to next section. The GPS modules
analysis. The GPS modules is

00:23:17.596,00:23:25.904
general way to hijacking the
drone and,er, GPS protocol is

00:23:25.904,00:23:26.805
not encrypt. Er, GPS protocol if
use for commercial is not

00:23:26.805,00:23:43.422
encrypt is call C /A for
commercial, er, there is, there

00:23:43.422,00:23:49.528
have another GPS protocol call:
Pcode. Pcode is for mainstream

00:23:49.528,00:23:59.238
so no more commercial can use
this encryption, no. Er, so, so,

00:23:59.238,00:24:09.081
every every commercial usage,
the GPS is, er, is er, easier

00:24:09.081,00:24:22.494
being attacked by attacker, er,
attacker can easy to fake this.

00:24:22.494,00:24:26.899
And er, I will finish off with
which function is associate with

00:24:26.899,00:24:34.907
the GPS. In these slide have
four function will impact by

00:24:34.907,00:24:46.418
faking the GPS. One is: no fly
zone. No fly zone mean DJI have,

00:24:46.418,00:24:56.662
say many place to the no fly
zone like, like the airport or

00:24:56.662,00:25:04.336
some important place so if you
fake the docket, if you are in

00:25:04.336,00:25:10.109
airport or some important place
the drone will be a false

00:25:10.109,00:25:16.715
landing. And, er, another
function is return to home.

00:25:16.715,00:25:25.657
Return to home mean: if you
press the return to home, the

00:25:25.657,00:25:29.161
drone will return to original
point. The other function is

00:25:29.161,00:25:34.166
called follow me. The follow me
is the, is the function…it means

00:25:36.735,00:25:41.740
if you move, the drone will,
will er also move. So the drone

00:25:47.446,00:25:52.451
always follow you. And the la
-latest function is way point.

00:26:05.564,00:26:10.302
The way point means: you can
setting the mutual location and

00:26:10.302,00:26:11.804
drone will go each location for
four function will be impaired

00:26:11.804,00:26:20.512
by fake GPS. Now I will
introduce how to spoof the GPS

00:26:20.512,00:26:26.819
location. They have a good open
source simulation directory in

00:26:26.819,00:26:34.159
GitHub called GPS SDR. But, it
have some limitation. Before you

00:26:34.159,00:26:38.897
want to fake a location you
should wait for a few minutes to

00:26:38.897,00:26:44.369
generate the IQ data. What is
the IQ data? IQ data is,er, if

00:26:44.369,00:26:50.042
you want to play SDR you must,
you must build a IQ data for,

00:26:50.042,00:27:01.453
for, for, modulation. And er,
er, so we improve the code, that

00:27:01.453,00:27:08.427
it can in real time generate the
GPS signal. And, er, can be

00:27:08.427,00:27:13.365
control with the joystick, that
is mean you don’t need to wait

00:27:13.365,00:27:18.270
five minute or a few minute to
generate the IQ data, you can

00:27:18.270,00:27:27.613
directly, real time fake the
point. And er, this is the, er,

00:27:27.613,00:28:23.902
demo. Er, wait a moment, sorry.
You can see I use the joystick

00:28:23.902,00:28:30.275
and it can directly impair the
GPS location. When I, I move to

00:28:30.275,00:28:37.549
left you see the GPS point is
move to left. And, er, I move to

00:28:37.549,00:28:45.757
other side, the GPS points is
move to other side. Then I move

00:28:45.757,00:28:54.499
to right side, it just move to,
to right. So we can use this,

00:28:54.499,00:29:09.581
this joystick to, to impair the
GPS location. [applause] Oh,

00:29:09.581,00:29:24.329
thank you. And now I demo to
fake landing the drone by fake

00:29:24.329,00:29:29.034
location into the no fly zone.
You can see the other side the

00:29:29.034,00:29:39.778
red circle is the no fly zone
and the er…I open the program

00:29:39.778,00:29:46.785
then, then, its need to we need
to wait a few, a few seconds

00:29:46.785,00:29:53.225
because, er, GPS, fake GPS
should should, take, er, take

00:29:53.225,00:30:03.635
er, some times to update the,
the satellite track. And the,

00:30:03.635,00:30:10.475
er, er, it is take about,
third-thirty minutes, er, thirty

00:30:10.475,00:30:16.715
second, so you can see finally
the drone is in the, the no fly

00:30:16.715,00:30:27.693
zone then drone take down. This
demo also is being paced in, in

00:30:27.693,00:30:33.231
paced [indistinguishable]
account so so I just want to, er

00:30:33.231,00:30:38.270
demo, demo this again, because I
think someone maybe now seeing

00:30:38.270,00:30:57.889
this and er… and er I want to
demo the er use the joystick to

00:30:57.889,00:31:10.769
hijacking the drone. Er, I open
the DJI follow me function and

00:31:10.769,00:31:18.310
you can see I not touching the
the remote controller. Then I

00:31:18.310,00:31:27.652
move the joystick can directly
move drone to to location I want

00:31:27.652,00:31:39.965
the drone to er, like I, I move
the joystick to the, to the my

00:31:39.965,00:31:54.045
side drone to take to my side.
Then, then I just forward this

00:31:54.045,00:32:01.419
for a few times. And er, er,
finally use joystick and easy,

00:32:01.419,00:32:17.335
easier to, to to control the
drone. But finally the drone

00:32:17.335,00:32:23.108
just er, er, move to to far
place I can’t control so I

00:32:23.108,00:32:35.654
switch to my, to my remote
controller. Then, er, because

00:32:35.654,00:32:46.331
this drone is, our company,
our company er, I turn so I can,

00:32:46.331,00:32:54.606
I can fly then to this er, I can
then disappear. So, finally I

00:32:54.606,00:33:00.879
use er, er, the AC controller
and get back the control. But

00:33:00.879,00:33:09.254
actually you can, if you want,
you can let the AC controller

00:33:09.254,00:33:13.525
now work. You just jamming the
er, two dot four gigahertz

00:33:13.525,00:33:20.131
frequency then control module
will be lost. That time you can

00:33:20.131,00:33:32.777
use the hijacking program to
fully control the drone. And er,

00:33:32.777,00:33:50.962
I want to introduce how to
detect the fake GPS signal. The

00:33:50.962,00:33:56.434
one way er, is avoid the GPS
sub-frame data, sub-frame data,

00:33:56.434,00:34:05.677
er, is data sent by GPS
satellite which contain the

00:34:05.677,00:34:13.218
satellite track information. But
fake GPS sub-frame data will

00:34:13.218,00:34:22.894
incorrect, er, like this. This
is the sub-frame data and you

00:34:22.894,00:34:28.400
can see the upside sub-frame
data is, er, is, er, true

00:34:28.400,00:34:34.039
satellite data and the the down
side is the fake GPS satellite

00:34:34.039,00:34:42.213
data. You can see something is
wrong. So you can, you can void

00:34:42.213,00:34:53.325
the sub-frame data to, to check
the signal is fake or real. But,

00:34:53.325,00:34:59.864
I know you must, you must think
if I just recall, replay the GPS

00:34:59.864,00:35:05.904
data the sub-frame will be
correct, yes it is. But, er, we

00:35:05.904,00:35:14.646
have another solution, when when
you . when you, er, recall and

00:35:14.646,00:35:21.586
replay the GPS, you can use, er,
time, you can void the time

00:35:21.586,00:35:25.790
between satellite time and the
real time. Because if you recall

00:35:25.790,00:35:33.698
and replay the time will be
wrong. So, this is another way

00:35:33.698,00:35:43.341
to detect a fake GPS signal. And
er, another way is, er, check

00:35:43.341,00:35:51.316
the motion speed between point
to point. Er, for example, it is

00:35:51.316,00:35:55.754
impossible to change your
location from Taiwan to Las

00:35:55.754,00:36:11.336
Vegas in one second, unless you
are dynamo or sonic. And er, er

00:36:11.336,00:36:21.046
finally, I development a fake
GPS signal device by just
measuring

00:36:21.046,00:36:27.552
ways and the, I, er, develop it
in the raspberry P, raspberry

00:36:27.552,00:36:40.131
pi, and er er, I buy a GPS in
module, is  a popular module
called

00:36:40.131,00:36:51.142
U-blox. This this the demo of
the tool I create. You can see,

00:36:51.142,00:36:55.914
er, this is raspberry pi and
this is ,er, my phone controller

00:36:55.914,00:37:03.955
hack of device. And I transfer
some fake GPS data and now, now

00:37:03.955,00:37:08.059
now it’s no more because the
fake GPS, they come, will take a

00:37:08.059,00:37:28.847
few time to affect. Er, er about
about thirty minutes. And er,

00:37:28.847,00:37:41.559
er. Wait a moment. I don’t know
why my screen is become black,

00:37:41.559,00:37:51.936
er, er. I…wait a moment. I press
this, okay? Is the screen being

00:37:51.936,00:38:01.279
hacker? Oh, [laughs]
[inaudible]. Er, no problem, I

00:38:01.279,00:39:21.426
just er take the… I think today
is unlucky. Er. Wait a moment.

00:39:21.426,00:39:23.561
[inaudible] oh, er. Oh, so it’s
the sound people

00:39:23.561,00:40:16.147
just…[inaudible] oh er…oh, I
need screen to er…[inaudible].

00:40:16.147,00:40:30.428
>>…these guys lost the signal…
>>Oh okay. [inaudible]. >>Sorry

00:40:30.428,00:41:31.889
for the interruption, guys, we
have A- AV tech is on the way,

00:41:31.889,00:41:37.929
erm, and they should be able to
fix this. Thanks. >>Actually

00:41:37.929,00:41:43.968
this is not my computer be hack,
so I have nowhere to start this

00:41:43.968,00:41:47.672
attack because my computer is
fine but the environment just

00:41:47.672,00:41:52.477
got attack… >>No, your computer
is fine. [inaudible]

00:41:52.477,00:42:09.260
>>Er…[inaudible] okay. >> So I
just take this opportunity to

00:42:09.260,00:42:17.201
remind people it’s not the back,
erm, and we probably gonna have

00:42:17.201,00:42:20.238
you compress over a little bit,
erm, at the end of the talk

00:42:20.238,00:43:35.146
which, you know a few minutes
here. [inaudible] [applause] >>

00:43:35.146,00:43:40.384
Er. Unfortunately, this talk, I
think maybe I can’t finish

00:43:40.384,00:44:17.755
because…[inaudible] >>Are you
close to the end? >>oh, okay. I

00:44:17.755,00:44:26.597
close. I’d like to, to publicly
provide my GitHub account that I

00:44:26.597,00:44:43.314
will, I will put my fake GPS
detection program to my

00:44:43.314,00:44:50.221
GitHub and, er…oh, sorry today
I, I think… >>It’s, it’s okay

00:44:50.221,00:45:01.065
man, you did a good job. >>Okay.
Thank you for coming and er, er

00:45:01.065,00:45:06.337
I would like to provide my
GitHub account. This account er,

00:45:06.337,00:45:15.046
will now be hacked by, er, by er
any anyone, er maybe. Er, my

00:45:15.046,00:45:21.385
account is Aaron, Aaron Lou.
Aaron dash Luo and I will

00:45:21.385,00:45:32.563
publish the attack and defense
to all to this GitHub. Thanks

00:45:32.563,00:00:00.000
for coming. [applause]
