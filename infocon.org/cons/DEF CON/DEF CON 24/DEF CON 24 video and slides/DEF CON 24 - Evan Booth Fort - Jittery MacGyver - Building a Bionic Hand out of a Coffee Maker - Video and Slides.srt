00:00:00.834,00:00:02.836
[background music playing]
>>Well goodmorning everybody.
How's everybody doing?[light

00:00:02.836,00:00:07.808
applause and cheer] Good?
[cheers] Aright. How many people
drink coffee? How many people

00:00:07.808,00:00:12.813
like good coffee? Well, if you
like good coffee, you're gonna
learn what you can do with that

00:00:15.215,00:00:21.021
Keurig during this uhh during
this talk because Keurigs uhh
produce mostly garbage but

00:00:21.021,00:00:26.026
really cool stuff. So let's uhh
let's give Evan a big round of
applause. [crowd applauds]

00:00:32.065,00:00:37.070
[music changes] >>Thank you.
Everybody hear me alright? Sound
good? Awesome I'm Evan umm as as

00:00:40.340,00:00:44.478
the gentlemen said. Uhh we're
gonna start off today uhh with
my uhh shotgun of random. I need

00:00:44.478,00:00:48.148
to put a a few rounds through
real quick. [shotgun cocks over
video] Just to get us going

00:00:48.148,00:00:50.918
[shotgun fires] So a lot of
these guys around these
protocols they're gonna become

00:00:50.918,00:00:55.355
more popular. Um uh uh companies
like this are going to start
adopt adopting them and then

00:00:55.355,00:00:59.726
they're gonna get cheaper and
cheaper, cheaper and cheaper and
then eventually it's going to be

00:00:59.726,00:01:03.130
in uh new construction and then
everyone will have this
connected home thing, right? And

00:01:03.130,00:01:08.302
so um eventually uh the audio
will be connected, uh lights in
your home will be connected, and

00:01:08.302,00:01:12.572
then someone's gonna find a a
God awful exploit and then ah I
really hope that it's one of you

00:01:12.572,00:01:17.577
and you have a sense of humor
and one of you uh does this.
[Video begins] [gunshot sound]

00:01:22.516,00:01:28.422
[gunshot sounds] [gunshot
sound][gunshot sounds][gunshot
sound] It's murder night! Yeah!

00:01:28.422,00:01:33.427
Wooo! And also this, umm
[coughs] Alright. [audience
murmurs] [shotgun cocks] Cool

00:01:42.169,00:01:47.841
[shotgun fires] So the next time
that you tell a joke that's uhhh
that everyone in your in your

00:01:47.841,00:01:52.045
aud in your crowd should get and
then umm they're a jerk about it
and they don't get it, er I

00:01:52.045,00:01:56.083
don't know say this, say "Hey
look man, I'm sorry, it it was
an inside joke, this thing we

00:01:56.083,00:02:01.254
all had to learn in elementary
school like you really, you just
had to be there I guess." So.

00:02:01.254,00:02:06.259
[shotgun cocks] Alright. [Video
begins, outdoor noises] >>Fwha?
Is that a goat? I just redid my

00:02:11.932,00:02:15.168
deck [goat noise]. >>I have a
deck goat. [clears throat]
Officially. [shotgun cocks] This

00:02:15.168,00:02:19.806
is all random stuff. [shotgun
fires] Cool. Wouldn't it be
terrible if you had some

00:02:19.806,00:02:24.177
condition where like all of your
inner dialogue was in garden
path sentences? So you'd be like

00:02:24.177,00:02:30.117
"Did I leave the bathroom light
on... toilet... paper? Dangit."
Great [shotgun cocks] Google

00:02:30.117,00:02:34.021
that later. Okay well [shotgun
fires] those guys who were jerks
that were like who says like

00:02:34.021,00:02:37.124
someone walks by quickly and
they're like "Hey where's the
fire?" Like that is the one time

00:02:37.124,00:02:41.428
that I really wish that I could
produce fire out of my hands.
That would be the best time for

00:02:41.428,00:02:47.300
that. [shotgun cocks] Alright.
[shotgun fires] Is Deviant in
here? Deviant? [silence] Cool

00:02:47.300,00:02:51.905
watch it later. Okay so umm yeah
so Deviants a uh we were all
sitting around at CarolinaCon

00:02:51.905,00:02:56.743
having a conversation, umm, and
he got paid a compliment by uh
Shaf and uh just wanted to let

00:02:56.743,00:03:00.113
you know that Shaf was
absolutely right about that one
hundred percent. And while we're

00:03:00.113,00:03:06.286
here umm anyone like yard sale
in here? Anyone like yard
salers? Anybody? Someone needs

00:03:06.286,00:03:09.423
to make an app because sometimes
you find stuff that's still like
in the package you know? Someone

00:03:09.423,00:03:12.659
needs to find an app that you
can just like scan that and uh
it'll tell you where to return

00:03:12.659,00:03:18.698
it and how much you can get for
it right? [chuckles] hmmm.
[shotgun cocks] Cool [shotgun

00:03:18.698,00:03:23.336
fires] ooop [shotgun cocks]
Alright well ok cool. Okay so
this is Jittery Macgyver. That

00:03:23.336,00:03:26.807
was a shotgun of random, sorry.
Umm we're today we're going to
be talking about finding

00:03:26.807,00:03:31.745
potential, and uh I guess
another way of looking at this
is uh is "Macgyvering" right? So

00:03:31.745,00:03:36.216
who watched Macgyver growing up,
in here? Should be a lot of you
right? So if you if you're the

00:03:36.216,00:03:40.487
uninitiated Mac- Macgyver you
could uhh you could put him in
any situation give him any any

00:03:40.487,00:03:44.825
stuff right and he can like use
that stuff and and like find a
solution and get his you know

00:03:44.825,00:03:50.030
get him in back in to safety,
right? So umm really cool guy, a
lotta fun to watch, uh and I I'm

00:03:50.030,00:03:54.134
I really love that that kind of
problem solving that kind of
engineering. So umm let's look

00:03:54.134,00:03:59.072
at a couple examples of of like
solid Macgyvering throughout
history. Ready? So um the first

00:03:59.072,00:04:05.378
one is George Washington Carver.
Uh this guy is is a complete and
utter badass. So um he uh he

00:04:05.378,00:04:10.450
arrived actually at a at a new
job, he's like the director of
ag- agriculture at uh um uh some

00:04:10.450,00:04:15.055
college in Georgia right? And uh
they didn't have money to buy
his lab equipment didn't even

00:04:15.055,00:04:19.259
tell him about it right? And so
like instead of like you know
rage quitting he uh he took his

00:04:19.259,00:04:23.697
students and he like he, they
went and scavenged like
junkyards and stuff and found

00:04:23.697,00:04:26.766
lab equipment and like
eventually got all the stuff
they needed to you know make

00:04:26.766,00:04:31.338
cool stuff happen. And you guys
probably know umm uh Mr. Carver
for his work on the peanut

00:04:31.338,00:04:35.041
right, he made you know a couple
of things with that. So he
looked at that and he said "You

00:04:35.041,00:04:38.612
know there's there's some
potential here in this little
thing." And uh he did a whole

00:04:38.612,00:04:44.851
whole lot with it. Another
really cool example is um uh uh
Cuba. Right so like in in '91 uh

00:04:44.851,00:04:50.290
when the um uh Soviet Union
dissolves they uh uh Cuba found
themselves in a in a really bad

00:04:50.290,00:04:54.327
financial crisis, right? Uhh
they couldn't like trade with
anybody and so they they sorta

00:04:54.327,00:04:59.166
had this stuff and they had to
really make do with what they
had. Uh just to just to get by.

00:04:59.166,00:05:03.170
So I mean the the whole whole
place turned into a bunch of
Macgyvers right? And the

00:05:03.170,00:05:06.006
government knew that it'd take
them a long time to like work
work their way out of this

00:05:06.006,00:05:10.076
problem, so they put out these
two publications. One was "The
Book for the Family" and the

00:05:10.076,00:05:14.481
other is uh uh "With Our Own
Efforts." And basically these
are like giant compilations of

00:05:14.481,00:05:19.519
like popular mechanics, and like
recipes, and how to guides and
just using stuff that they

00:05:19.519,00:05:24.191
already had right? So this this
book is really interesting, it's
uh it's pretty long it's like

00:05:24.191,00:05:28.028
three hundred pages long. Uhh
I'll highlight some some of the
the really interesting things

00:05:28.028,00:05:34.134
for you here. So um, I've first
off is uh is this cutout of the
person with like a a an

00:05:34.134,00:05:38.772
uncomfortable amount of
attention paid to the nipular
region,for [audience

00:05:38.772,00:05:43.043
chuckles]God knows why. Umm.
This is uh it looks like plans
for a for a primitive kill

00:05:43.043,00:05:48.748
yourself device hhh.[audience
chuckles] And if you like the
AK-47 you're gonna love AK-47 on

00:05:48.748,00:05:53.553
a stick for...[audience laughs]
reasons [more laughter] This
one's my favorite though this is

00:05:53.553,00:05:58.758
the the "Desplasmatizador" and
uh this you take jars and you
connect them with either wires

00:05:58.758,00:06:04.497
or tubes or something maybe some
needles, this is uhh I think
that's uh maybe like uh like

00:06:04.497,00:06:09.603
unsettled uh uh Italian dressing
or something? I don't know. But
anyways you you plug all that

00:06:09.603,00:06:14.140
into what looks like uh either a
motor or a or a uh compressor
from a refrigerator and then you

00:06:14.140,00:06:18.144
plug that immediately into the
wall. And I think this probably
opens up a a portal to a to an

00:06:18.144,00:06:23.083
alternate dimension where
terrible ideas come from. But
uhh One thing that everyone had

00:06:23.083,00:06:28.555
is is this Aurika washer slash
dryer combination. And
everybody's dryer, part of this

00:06:28.555,00:06:32.659
thing, cracked out, right?
Something went wrong with it,
and couldn't use it anymore, so

00:06:32.659,00:06:36.863
like this this spawned a whole
like underground industry of
people who were crafty enough to

00:06:36.863,00:06:41.234
take these things and like most
of the time they would just cut
it right in the middle and

00:06:41.234,00:06:46.106
discard the uh the dryer part.
But the motors in them were
still good. So they used those

00:06:46.106,00:06:50.910
motors for everything. Like this
is shredding coconut, this is a
key duplication machine, um this

00:06:50.910,00:06:56.349
I mean it's like a outboard
motor ep em empeller er
propellor and um slapped it on

00:06:56.349,00:07:00.887
the motor and made a fan, right?
Pretty awesome. And everything
was like this. So umm if you

00:07:00.887,00:07:05.025
wanted something you had to
build it. And so you had like
glasses like these, which would

00:07:05.025,00:07:09.596
like earn you plus ten charisma
for even looking at them I
think. [audience laughs] Holy

00:07:09.596,00:07:14.301
crap [audience laughs] And like
these locks are look they look
pretty secure, right? I dunno.

00:07:14.301,00:07:19.706
Uh yeah maybe those are they
have some in the lock pickers I
dunno. Uh this thing, uh

00:07:19.706,00:07:24.978
supposedly this this uh like
refreshed uh hearing aid
batteries. Umm also if you if

00:07:24.978,00:07:29.115
you were drinking while you used
it it would remove the need for
hearing aids all together 'cause

00:07:29.115,00:07:34.287
you would be dead a lot.
[audience laughs] So um this is
actually like [chuckles] like

00:07:34.287,00:07:39.125
homemade plastic extrusions
stuff, right? So like if if OG
like Cuban Baine was around he'd

00:07:39.125,00:07:44.364
be like "Ugh you merely adopted
3D printing erherher." Right?
And everything's like this. So

00:07:44.364,00:07:50.036
they use these metal food trays
as a as antennas. It's amazing
stuff so uh a lot of really

00:07:50.036,00:07:53.173
really interesting stuff.
There's I guess a whole website
uh it's called Technological

00:07:53.173,00:07:58.778
Disobedience uhh just like
dedicated just for this stuff,
right? So another er really

00:07:58.778,00:08:04.718
great example it comes from 1970
and uh April 11th we launched
Apollo thirteen. And you guys

00:08:04.718,00:08:08.288
know that you know we got into
space okay there were a few
hiccups here and there and we

00:08:08.288,00:08:13.126
were you know trucking along and
all of a sudden [Voice over
video] ...Houston we have a

00:08:13.126,00:08:17.931
problem here. >>This is Houston
say again please. >> Uh Houston
we've got a problem. Now Houston

00:08:17.931,00:08:21.768
we've got a problem. Right so
they got uh uh they thought they
got hit by hit by an asteroid at

00:08:21.768,00:08:25.839
first but turns out it was just
uh just a short in some some
Teflon insulation on some wires.

00:08:25.839,00:08:30.710
Tt caused a fire it caused an
oxygen tank to explode and then
all of the sudden like they

00:08:30.710,00:08:35.515
don't have any life support. So
they had to tunnel over to the
lunar module and stay over there

00:08:35.515,00:08:39.919
'cause that had a separate life
support module but uh the
problem was that they uh were

00:08:39.919,00:08:44.991
clogging the the lithium
hydroxide filters which scrub
the you know the the air um from

00:08:44.991,00:08:48.728
you know for the like the of C2
and it it makes it breathable
again right? So you've got all

00:08:48.728,00:08:51.898
of the astronauts uh in this
thing and they need to be in
there for four days, that's way

00:08:51.898,00:08:57.404
too long. So NASA they they you
know anticipated this and uh
they got busy right? So they're

00:08:57.404,00:09:01.875
back at home base and like "well
they've got filters but you know
they're they're square and they

00:09:01.875,00:09:06.546
need to fit in a round hole" and
that's like the literally the
the the peg scenario, right? So

00:09:06.546,00:09:10.750
they came up with this. This is
the mailbox rig. Basically they
just took like, you know, the

00:09:10.750,00:09:15.355
the cardboard cover off the
flight plan and a piece of you
know plastic here and a tube

00:09:15.355,00:09:19.159
there and all this stuff, and
they they you know made it back
on Earth and then they sent them

00:09:19.159,00:09:22.128
the instructions. And they're
astronauts so they figured it
out you know and they made one

00:09:22.128,00:09:27.133
themselves. Look how calm he
looks, just like "Yeah, I just
made a mailbox rig." [audience

00:09:27.133,00:09:30.970
chuckles] Saved, uh, everybody's
life right? So you guys probably
know this story, but my favorite

00:09:30.970,00:09:35.442
part is this guy, Ed Smylie.
He's the uh the was the chief of
pre-systems division at the time

00:09:35.442,00:09:40.447
and he spearheaded the design
and the the testing of the
mailbox rig and uh he's amazing.

00:09:40.447,00:09:43.850
And something that he said
later, like after they landed,
was this: "So when I found out

00:09:43.850,00:09:48.855
we had duct tape on board, we
were pretty well homefree."
[audience laughs and claps]

00:09:55.128,00:10:00.800
Crazy. So those are a few great
examples in history that I love.
Umm wanna talk about the few

00:10:00.800,00:10:04.471
things that I've done
personally, right? So um, the
first thing is everyone's got

00:10:04.471,00:10:08.808
like a Big Ben of of cables in
your in your home in your
office, in your closet,

00:10:08.808,00:10:13.413
somewhere right? I I was no
exception and I I you know found
that thing and I was like "You

00:10:13.413,00:10:17.717
know I ki- I wanna do something
with this." So I made a
universal serial bullwhip. And

00:10:17.717,00:10:22.622
this is uh uh uh eight foot, uh
eighteen blunt bullwhip
[audience stirs and murmurs] And

00:10:22.622,00:10:28.495
there's a uh a very thin leather
belt on the end with a regular
nylon cracker and um there's one

00:10:28.495,00:10:35.435
thick like DVI cable like as the
trunk in the middle you know.
And uhh you think it cracks? You

00:10:35.435,00:10:40.907
wanna see? [Video plays] [Video
freezes] Uh well, tell you what,
hang on. I've got it right here.

00:10:40.907,00:10:45.912
Let's do this thing live,
alright? [audience claps] So
this is probably the first time

00:10:49.849,00:10:54.854
ever that uh you guys need to
pray to the demo gods huh?
[audience laughs] [strong whip

00:11:07.400,00:11:13.072
crack] [audience claps] That's a
bunch of metal. It'd probably
tear your face off. Alright. So

00:11:13.072,00:11:17.210
another one I was going down to
a conference in Atlanta and I I
brought this giant uh pelican

00:11:17.210,00:11:23.116
case just full of office stuff,
right? So I immediately got to
the hotel room and don't tell

00:11:23.116,00:11:29.455
them that I uhh well...I took
everything apart and from the
ashes arose Milton! And Milton,

00:11:29.455,00:11:34.060
I don't even know what it is,
exactly, but it's like a a
really heavy spiky bat thing

00:11:34.060,00:11:39.699
with a with a red swing line on
the end. Um...for the name
[audience laughs] Dude, paper

00:11:39.699,00:11:44.337
shredder heads are are like
they're gnarly man like good
grief [audience laughs] I got so

00:11:44.337,00:11:48.341
many like little pricks and cuts
and that's RJ45 just wrapping
everything everything together

00:11:48.341,00:11:52.645
like a boss. So basically just
took uh, like you guys ever
heard of like an all in one

00:11:52.645,00:11:57.116
printer? It's like gears and
rods and like demons hah it's
like I don't even know how it

00:11:57.116,00:12:01.921
works man. There's there's a
spell on all of them. And I took
like the long you know sturdy

00:12:01.921,00:12:06.559
pieces and then I wrapped them
all in like some uh uh like case
metal right? And I duct taped

00:12:06.559,00:12:11.564
all that. And this is the size
of it. Umm. Compared to uh, to
two Evans. And um, it's uhh I

00:12:13.866,00:12:18.871
guess around around 13-14 pounds
so, let's see what it does here.
[Video plays][smashing noise] So

00:12:21.341,00:12:26.346
that was a coconut [audience
murmurs] Here's slow-mo [slow
smashing noise] The resolution

00:12:28.648,00:12:35.555
on this video is practically
hand drawn. [laughs] [audience
laughs] Alright let's see if he

00:12:35.555,00:12:41.294
can do anymore here. [smashing
sound] Oh! Man. You would not
want to get racked with that.

00:12:41.294,00:12:44.330
Alright, so.[audience murmuring]
Uh, that was Milton. Another
thing I worked on was Terminal

00:12:44.330,00:12:48.434
Cornucopia and this is something
I did uh a couple years ago and
uh the project itself spanned

00:12:48.434,00:12:52.872
about a year and a half an uh
basically I I uh hypothesized
that a a potential attacker

00:12:52.872,00:12:56.809
could go into an airport with
nothing but cash, right? Maybe
like a small travel proof

00:12:56.809,00:13:01.881
multi-tool and um they could
having successfully gotten
through security for there's no

00:13:01.881,00:13:06.085
reason not to, just go like to
the shops you know and get
things that anyone can grab and

00:13:06.085,00:13:10.123
then make potentially de- deadly
weapons with it right? So I
wanted to to figure out if that

00:13:10.123,00:13:14.927
was uh if that was the case and
so I set up some rules. So you
can only use materials that can

00:13:14.927,00:13:18.598
be sourced inside the terminal
after security screening. Can't
walk in with anything but cash

00:13:18.598,00:13:22.902
and a small travel approved
multi-tool. And anything you'd
get yelled at for taking or

00:13:22.902,00:13:27.106
messing with is completely off
limits, right? And I found some
crazy stuff in airports in my

00:13:27.106,00:13:32.111
day. Like, uh drills and all
sorts of stuff. So I went to a
bunch of airports. And things

00:13:34.681,00:13:39.085
that I I like couldn't uh buy
commonly you know on the store I
would get at the airport

00:13:39.085,00:13:44.590
otherwise I'd just shop at like
Walmart or something. Made for
some really creepy purchases but

00:13:44.590,00:13:49.629
[audience laughs]. So um I
worked on this for about a year,
and sort of like you know scaled

00:13:49.629,00:13:54.634
up the uh complexity as I went
and here is a supercut of the uh
the results. [video begins]

00:14:12.985,00:14:18.324

[drill sound] Boop.
[click][click] So, completely

00:15:06.272,00:15:11.277
remote incendiary device there.
Then I put it in a suitcase.

00:20:08.741,00:20:10.743

This went on for like half an

00:20:10.743,00:20:12.745
hour. [explosions] Yeah like
everywhere. [music and

00:20:12.745,00:20:16.582
[music fades] So hey, you can
make weapons ha out of uh stuff
you buy in airports [chuckles]

00:20:16.582,00:20:18.584
[audience applauds and cheers].
Awesome. That's a lotta fun.
Alright so that was actually the

00:20:18.584,00:20:20.820
really long version of the video
I thought that was so I'm going
to go through this quickly. So

00:20:20.820,00:20:24.990
this is practical
post-apocalyptic electronics. Um
I I wa- was worried tha- that

00:20:24.990,00:20:28.060
more and more people don't
really understand anything about
electricity whatsoever but

00:20:28.060,00:20:32.064
everyone sort of relies on it,
right? That's a problem. So I
kind of set out to figure out

00:20:32.064,00:20:35.835
like like what's the, what's the
least amount of information
someone would need to know to to

00:20:35.835,00:20:39.972
like make practical work happen
with electricity, right. If they
just have the stuff in their

00:20:39.972,00:20:44.210
house. No tools re anything like
that. So I so I stayed in a
shack in Kentucky. That's like a

00:20:44.210,00:20:50.483
six and a half foot by eleven
foot shack with no power in
Kentucky, um for about a week

00:20:50.483,00:20:55.488
[video begins] and um it'd been
about fifteen years since I'd
been in there, it's secure.

00:20:58.257,00:21:03.195
Totes. Aaaaaand there he is.
Okay. That is a giant spider
[clears throat] so the shack is

00:21:09.168,00:21:12.972
gone and [audience chuckles]
Just kidding. [audience laughs]
I'm kidding I like lined the

00:21:12.972,00:21:17.343
walls with uh with tarp like I
used that foam stuff like all of
it [chuckles] in that whole

00:21:17.343,00:21:21.814
city. Uh so yeah I just started
building stuff. So um used a you
know one of those tchotchke

00:21:21.814,00:21:25.518
flashlights LED flashlights.
Mounted that to a full bottle
uhl bottle of water acts as a

00:21:25.518,00:21:30.122
diffuser made a nice little
centerpiece there. Strung up
some lights. Um this is power

00:21:30.122,00:21:34.393
management. I had several ways
to power I wanted uh, I wanted
to end up with twelve volts and

00:21:34.393,00:21:38.464
five volts, right? Twelve volts
is is common with like you know
vehicles and um and automotive

00:21:38.464,00:21:43.702
and then uh five obviously is
common USB so you're gonna have
a a billion batteries that's uhh

00:21:43.702,00:21:47.673
you know regulate at five volts
and then um a lot of stuff that
consumes five volts, right? So

00:21:47.673,00:21:54.446
um and there's a strong set. Uhh
let's see so yeah put this this
uh control panel on the wall and

00:21:54.446,00:21:58.651
uh this you know does uh
different things. I found a a
relay some place. Uh let's see

00:21:58.651,00:22:03.889
this actually uh arms my uh
security system in there. So you
have to have a key to to disable

00:22:03.889,00:22:07.993
it [laughs]. Or just rip it out
the wall I dunno. So uh yeah so
the first thing I wanted to do

00:22:07.993,00:22:14.333
is like like sorta like automate
things right? So um I found this
uh momentary switch, and a leaf

00:22:14.333,00:22:19.338
blower and I wanted to make it
so when I walk in, I have it
taped down, [bird sounds on

00:22:22.007,00:22:25.945
video] That the light would
automatically cut on for me.
Isn't that nice?I wanted an

00:22:25.945,00:22:30.049
alarm too right? 'Cause it's
Kentucky and you you're just
gonna die any minute. So I took

00:22:30.049,00:22:35.554
a head unit out of an old Honda
and uh specifically the uh
little uh umm uh gear assembly

00:22:35.554,00:22:40.559
that it ejects the uh cd rom, cd
rom, cd. And I made a uh a
really redneck latching relay.

00:22:44.530,00:22:47.633
[clicking over video] So I
wanted uh I wanted this set up
to where like when you trigger

00:22:47.633,00:22:51.904
it it's uh it does not be you
know become undone by you know
undoing the thing you just did

00:22:51.904,00:22:56.041
to trigger it, right? So in this
case opening the door. And how
this works basically is this um,

00:22:56.041,00:23:00.679
this little mechanism starts
winding up and that's uh starts
pulling on that that trot line

00:23:00.679,00:23:04.316
which yanks the little piece of
plastic out of the way between
uh the closepin that have two

00:23:04.316,00:23:08.954
leads on it. That is the only
thing separating uh those leads
from connecting and um

00:23:08.954,00:23:13.392
completing the circuit on this
uh thirty two volts er, er rated
nine volts. So. And all of that

00:23:13.392,00:23:18.397
runs down to the weasel.
[sniffs] On the wall. [audience
laughs] Of course. [sound from

00:23:48.260,00:23:50.262
video] [ignition] [flames
crackling and popping ] Ahh
friggin' spiders. How's that?!

00:23:50.262,00:23:52.464
[audience chuckles] So yeah. So
I got I got off that and and I
uh I thought you know the scope

00:23:52.464,00:23:55.668
is a bit too broad. Ss it it
it's tough for people to connect
with that. So I started looking

00:23:55.668,00:24:00.839
at specific uh pieces of
hardware. So like what is our
Aurika washer dryer combo? Like

00:24:00.839,00:24:06.745
you know the like for US. So I I
started looking at Keurigs and
um Keurigs are interesting to me

00:24:06.745,00:24:10.215
for a couple reasons, right? So
Keurigs like uh they're in
nearly one in every three homes;

00:24:10.215,00:24:15.220
that's a survey done last year.
And um uh the the um no lack of
critical issues for sure like

00:24:18.090,00:24:22.795
these things break all the time
for different reasons across
generations and uh if you guys

00:24:22.795,00:24:26.098
you guys've like ever pulled one
apart or pulled one open uh,
there's a lot of really cool

00:24:26.098,00:24:30.336
stuff in there, right? So,
that's a nice recipe. 'Cause you
have a lotta a lotta these being

00:24:30.336,00:24:35.474
thrown out and a lot of the the
components are still good,
right, minus one. And um I

00:24:35.474,00:24:38.811
wanted to know what you can do
with that. So I wanted to find
like "what's the potential of a

00:24:38.811,00:24:42.948
Keurig?" So I've gotten started
on that and here we are. So uh
just quick review of the common

00:24:42.948,00:24:47.052
internals, so you'll have a
display of some sort. This is
usually connected to uh like you

00:24:47.052,00:24:52.791
know you're user interface stuff
so maybe some buttons, umm. The
more recent models they upgraded

00:24:52.791,00:24:58.230
a bit and they have uh just a a
four conductor uh uh resistant
touch screen so it kinda cleans

00:24:58.230,00:25:04.036
things up. Um this is kinda the
the sort of the main board and
this is sort of like a molotov

00:25:04.036,00:25:08.240
of PCB's right so it's like like
service mount on the front
through a hole in the back.

00:25:08.240,00:25:11.176
Yeeeah. [audience chuckles]
Although that's the front I
think but it doesn't work as

00:25:11.176,00:25:15.280
well for the joke. So uh lots of
little ribbon cables and wires
here and there. Uh some of these

00:25:15.280,00:25:19.718
transformers these have like
some of them have discrete you
know power uh regulation boards

00:25:19.718,00:25:23.155
and all that. Yeah you can like
find like nice little breakouts
here and there, this is a a

00:25:23.155,00:25:28.394
momentary switch with a couple
LEDs. Um you'll find some of
these um nice um reed switches

00:25:28.394,00:25:32.631
here, uh these magnetic
switches, these uh make sure
that you get the lid closed and

00:25:32.631,00:25:37.636
all that. You'll find some
bottle caps in there for scale.
Uh anyone know what this is?

00:25:40.272,00:25:43.442
[silence] So this is the guy
responsible for the DRM In the
two dot oh models,

00:25:43.442,00:25:49.515
alright.[audience murmurs] Yeah
its a it just reads the levels
of uh RGB and A I think. So yeah

00:25:49.515,00:25:53.952
you'll find one of these at
least uh one, some kind of pump,
uh or some kind of motor

00:25:53.952,00:25:59.124
assembly. Uh uh some of these
are really nice, right? This one
came out of a Vue and uh it's a

00:25:59.124,00:26:03.896
nice depo motor it's got like
built in uh speed control uh
it's got a brake on it, it's got

00:26:03.896,00:26:07.800
reverse, it's got a hall effect
sensor built in, all this stuff.
Uh the newer ones the two dot

00:26:07.800,00:26:11.670
ohs they don't have that they
got a regular DC brushless-
brushless motor but uh that's

00:26:11.670,00:26:15.774
ok. You'll find some of these uh
that's an air pump here and
there there's a water pump on

00:26:15.774,00:26:19.978
the right. The old ones have
these solenoids which is nice.
Uh the new ones they they sorta

00:26:19.978,00:26:24.983
did away with that. All of them
will have a boiler of some sort.
Here's one right here. And um a

00:26:29.388,00:26:33.992
ton of uh both flexible and
rigid tubing and uh there's all
these connectors and stuff that

00:26:33.992,00:26:38.130
you would put in a sock if you
wanted to kill someone in prison
[audience chuckles]. And a whole

00:26:38.130,00:26:42.935
lotta plastic right? Different
types of plastic, brittleness,
thickness, you know all that

00:26:42.935,00:26:47.473
stuff right. So, man! You could
do a lotta stuff with that,
right? Anyone's like, you know,

00:26:47.473,00:26:53.645
wheels turning here? Mine surely
were. So uh just a quick
disclaimer um I don't represent

00:26:53.645,00:26:58.050
Keurig in any way. I I'm
actually a customer I use mine a
couple times a day I work at

00:26:58.050,00:27:02.888
home. Uh I say what I want uh
spaghetti. So [audience
chuckles] um first thing I

00:27:02.888,00:27:08.961
wanted to do is is look at look
at uh a thermal energy of a
Keurig working normally and so

00:27:08.961,00:27:13.499
um I did that. Basically um who
in here thinks that that Keurigs
when they boil they boil under

00:27:13.499,00:27:18.504
pressure, when the water heats
up? There's one guy, so. No they
actually they boil into the

00:27:22.307,00:27:26.111
atmosphere so that was
disappointed about that. So
basically water heats up in the

00:27:26.111,00:27:30.916
boiler and then um uh a
different pump rams air into
that and forces it out over your

00:27:30.916,00:27:36.455
coffee grounds into your cup,
right? Excellent. So I wanted to
figure out how to really disturb

00:27:36.455,00:27:40.926
that process so I started
working on WoRPaW! Which is an
acronym for the worst part of

00:27:40.926,00:27:45.164
waking up. [Audience chuckles]
So I you know started taking it
apart and and keep in mind guys

00:27:45.164,00:27:50.369
this is not like an exploit or
anything this is like straight
up sabotage [chuckles] right?

00:27:50.369,00:27:54.206
[laughs] Like there there's no
uh [laughs] there's no
disclosure here. Yeah so uh you

00:27:54.206,00:28:00.579
know yg- you got AC comin' in
and um that connects here to our
main board, right? And then it

00:28:00.579,00:28:05.183
eventually goes back out to
these heating elements. But not
before passing through uh these

00:28:05.183,00:28:11.390
two guys. And umm these are both
uh uh heat related. So the
bottom one is a uh an SE fuse,

00:28:11.390,00:28:17.095
it's got a little um uh organic
thermo uh sensitive compound,
and it's it's uh crafted in such

00:28:17.095,00:28:20.499
a way that if it gets you know
reaches a cer- certain
temperature it melts down,

00:28:20.499,00:28:26.071
spring disengages, and it it you
know separates your your um uh
your your circuit forever right?

00:28:26.071,00:28:29.641
The top one it just uh either
stays on or off until it reaches
a certain temperature and then

00:28:29.641,00:28:34.680
it it flip flops. Also this guy,
it's a little pressure sensor
right? Little tube running into

00:28:34.680,00:28:37.583
the bottom. I would imagine that
probably has something to do
with whether or not they're

00:28:37.583,00:28:44.590
going to power you know the the
uh heating element on the
boiler. Bless you. So um if only

00:28:44.590,00:28:49.394
there was a way to uh to bypass
you know all of this logic- oh
right wire ties! So

00:28:49.394,00:28:54.099
yeah.[audience chuckles] Um now
we've got a you know one twenty
volt AC going directly to the

00:28:54.099,00:28:57.803
the heating element, so that
should be good. But we still
have the the issue of these

00:28:57.803,00:29:02.741
three guys here right? Oh yeah
right so uh JB valve. That'll do
it. Cool so yeah. Umm now we've

00:29:05.644,00:29:11.116
got a boiler that's got water in
it, that is uh should be sealed,
right? and umm [video begins]

00:29:11.116,00:29:16.121
Let's see what happens.
[steaming sound] Awwwwwww.
[continued steaming] All of our

00:29:27.466,00:29:32.471
precious pressure. [more
steaming sounds] And it's. Look
at it thermally, it looks

00:29:36.375,00:29:41.380
normal. Until it just like all
of the sudden turns into satan's
butthole and the thing just goes

00:29:44.116,00:29:49.187
sideways.[sounds continue] So I
actually left this on to see if
like anything else would happen.

00:29:49.187,00:29:52.658
I didn't figure it would, it
just got hotter and hotter until
like the the whole house started

00:29:52.658,00:29:56.461
smelling like sat- satan's
butthole, and then I cut it off
[audience chuckles] Because it

00:29:56.461,00:30:01.500
was on fire pretty much, you
know? [audience laughs] It got
super melty [laughs] It really

00:30:01.500,00:30:05.637
smelled awful. Good grief. But
yeah no I figured that you know
our our seals failed but they

00:30:05.637,00:30:10.976
did not! Actually uh it was a
different result and um both of
er were uh all three of our

00:30:10.976,00:30:17.382
seals were intact. What happened
was um, it just got too hot.
Like the whole top sorta like

00:30:17.382,00:30:21.987
melted and slid to the side and
just let all the pressure out,
right? So that was kind of a

00:30:21.987,00:30:26.191
bummer, I wanted it to explode
and all that. But it's okay,
because science, right? That's a

00:30:26.191,00:30:31.697
result, now we know, so uh we
can sorta move on to to new
things. So um the next thing I I

00:30:31.697,00:30:35.767
worked on right, er actually
this was at during a conference
I um I built a DeBBUG.And this

00:30:35.767,00:30:41.740
is uh th- a delicious uh
beverage dispensing badge of
unmitigated glory. And so

00:30:41.740,00:30:48.246
basically um you got a uh
solenoid and an air pump. Uh uh
one button pumps air into the uh

00:30:48.246,00:30:52.451
container with the delicious
beverage, and then um when you
um press the other button to

00:30:52.451,00:30:58.256
disengage the solenoid. That uh
has to go somewhere so it comes
out the little spout just like

00:30:58.256,00:31:03.195
this. [video begins] [liquid
dripping] Ahh. [liquid dripping]
Good job fella. [audience

00:31:11.870,00:31:15.073
chuckles] So when I travel with
this, I like to leave a note,
just to be just to be nice I

00:31:15.073,00:31:20.645
guess, 'cause it looks, it looks
sketchy man. [audience laughs]
Seriously [laughter] although I

00:31:20.645,00:31:25.917
must say every time I've
traveled with this my my luggage
has not been searched. Soo...

00:31:25.917,00:31:27.919
[audience chuckles] Or at least
they're not leaving notes any
more I don't know. Do they leave

00:31:27.919,00:31:32.924
notes still? They leave notes,
right? Oh man. Anyways so yeah
um mov- moves on to my uh, my my

00:31:36.361,00:31:39.865
big bill here and this is this
is HEDBERG [light audience
noise] And uh, that's not an

00:31:39.865,00:31:43.735
acronym at all. Uh so I, I
wanted t- I wanted to build
something that was um,

00:31:43.735,00:31:48.974
moderately complex, it had to
had to have some precision to
really sort of work well, and um

00:31:48.974,00:31:54.146
I started looking at at these uh
prosthetic hands, right? And
these are cool because like

00:31:54.146,00:31:56.948
there's some really nice ones.
This one's like I think eighty
grand, something like that

00:31:56.948,00:32:01.253
something insane. But also
there's some really great work
happening in like the 3D space,

00:32:01.253,00:32:04.923
right? Like you could print
these for ten bucks! And they
they function they're great. You

00:32:04.923,00:32:07.893
get to like as soon as you
outgrow them you just print
another one, so not a big deal,

00:32:07.893,00:32:13.398
ya know? Um and it's all open
source, and it's great right? So
I kinda wanted to see where umm

00:32:13.398,00:32:17.502
where I could get you know um
just eh relative to both the you
know I guess the commercial

00:32:17.502,00:32:21.439
product, right, which is crazy
and then sort of what uh people
are doing with uh with additive

00:32:21.439,00:32:26.912
printing. So uh I started making
some junk prototypes just to
sort of feel out um what was

00:32:26.912,00:32:32.484
possible. Get a get an idea of
how the materials work together
and so I you know I just started

00:32:32.484,00:32:37.689
tinkering with uh with different
mechanisms just to, I don't know
see what works and what didn't.

00:32:37.689,00:32:41.126
[sound from video] So there's
that. I started uh you know
dealing with these little finger

00:32:41.126,00:32:45.263
guys. 'Cause really I think the
the digits were were the thing I
wanted to to really kinda nail,

00:32:45.263,00:32:49.467
that's sort of the uh the
linchpin right? So I tried a
different couple different

00:32:49.467,00:32:54.372
designs, did a lot of research,
saw what other people were
doing. And um I felt like you

00:32:54.372,00:32:58.043
know based on all that
knowledge, I I could go ahead
and start my build right? So I

00:32:58.043,00:33:03.448
started working on HEDBERG and
um a couple things to uh to note
here I used a one single Keurig,

00:33:03.448,00:33:08.453
right? Uh one single um K three
fifty err three hundred kinda
the same thing. And um uh only

00:33:10.555,00:33:15.827
external materials in in the um
in the head the end products are
adhesives, and I think there

00:33:15.827,00:33:20.565
were a couple of iterations in
design. You probably uh do away
with a lot of that. I just used

00:33:20.565,00:33:25.704
basic tools. You know I didn't
wanna like you know how you
watch a uh a video on youtube or

00:33:25.704,00:33:28.540
something and someone makes
something cool and it's like
well yeah they've got a pristine

00:33:28.540,00:33:33.178
shop with like every tool
imaginable, right? So we're like
I don't know, that's kinda

00:33:33.178,00:33:38.016
cheating right? So I just use a
a dremel basically and a heat
gun and some hand tools, files,

00:33:38.016,00:33:43.655
stuff like that. Uh no plans for
this just uh just sort of you
know making it up as I go along

00:33:43.655,00:33:47.692
[breathes] and so um at the end
of the day it was uh a hundred
and ninety nine hours sixty-six

00:33:47.692,00:33:53.565
minutes and thirty-six seconds
of working time. So that's
that's uh time at the bench, um

00:33:53.565,00:33:57.769
you know with my hands on
materials doing things and
manipulating stuff. And guess

00:33:57.769,00:34:02.707
what? I recorded every second of
that. And you're gonna see it
now [audience laughs]Settle in.

00:34:17.956,00:34:22.961
[video begins] [box moving] You
have to drum on it to get it
started. [more box sounds] It's

00:34:42.781,00:34:47.786
every second of this whole
build, settle in [Clair De Lune
plays] [music continues][video

00:38:06.985,00:38:11.990
ends]Heyyy!! [audience applauds]
That's HEDBERG! [more applause]
[HEDBERG working] Beautiful.

00:39:40.678,00:39:47.151
Thank you for working. [audience
applause] So of course I made a
case for it, and uh of course it

00:39:47.151,00:39:52.156
was a an issue with TSA [laughs]
[audience laughs] So yeah uh
let's talk about the features

00:39:52.156,00:39:55.560
real quick so it's got
distributed grip pressure. I
used a sort of a fulcrum here in

00:39:55.560,00:40:01.065
the middle so um if uh if
there's some more pressure on
like one side of the hand or

00:40:01.065,00:40:03.935
some side of the fingers or the
other it it sort of like
compensates with the other uh

00:40:03.935,00:40:09.507
other side. It has a an official
gangster electronic speed
controller on it so uh there are

00:40:09.507,00:40:14.212
no like five five five timers or
no like components necessary to
build a traditional one. So uh

00:40:14.212,00:40:18.016
the issue was the the regular
motor. It just moves too quickly
right? Your hand would just be

00:40:18.016,00:40:21.719
like going crazy it has no
control so umm I had to
improvise. So usually the way

00:40:21.719,00:40:25.690
this is done is with a pulse
with modulation. Umm so like
think about an LED it's either

00:40:25.690,00:40:30.228
on or off, right? But you could
dim them by turning them on and
off really really fast and then

00:40:30.228,00:40:34.532
like it d- gets more dim when
you have it on less than you
have it off. Makes sense? So

00:40:34.532,00:40:39.671
yeah um the way I did that uh is
I basically took uh one of those
motors and I took a piece of

00:40:39.671,00:40:43.074
plastic in the middle and uh
mounted a magnet on one side of
the thing that spins in the

00:40:43.074,00:40:48.079
middle. And then uh on the other
side I just mounted a magnetic
switch, right. So uh you end up

00:40:50.348,00:40:55.887
with something like this and
there's the little uh screw
there to adjust the um uh the

00:40:55.887,00:41:01.893
amount of of uh exposure that
umm uh magnetic switch actually
gets with the magnet. So it it

00:41:01.893,00:41:07.632
it actually increases or
decreases the pressures. You can
see it working here. [mechanical

00:41:07.632,00:41:14.472
noise]Makes sense? So every time
that magnet swings around and it
trips that se- sensor it puts uh

00:41:14.472,00:41:18.109
twelve volts in that that motor,
your hand moves forward just a
little bit more. So slowing it

00:41:18.109,00:41:21.946
down, I thought about using
friction but that's probably a
bad idea so uh you have to drop

00:41:21.946,00:41:26.918
the voltage. Tried a voltage
divider. The the resistors
actually in in the um uh Keurig

00:41:26.918,00:41:32.023
were were not rated high enough
and these started smoking,
that's bad. So um eventually um

00:41:32.023,00:41:36.627
my I call my brother and he was
like "yeah just, you know diodes
they they drop the voltage about

00:41:36.627,00:41:39.997
point seven volts". And there
were like nine of them in the
Keurig, so I just chained a

00:41:39.997,00:41:44.202
bunch of them together so.
[chuckles] It works just fine,
doesn't get too hot. You know

00:41:44.202,00:41:47.805
there are some room for
improvements of course I built
it so to me it's perfect. Umm

00:41:47.805,00:41:51.175
but yeah you know if you put a
microcontroller and a few
components in this thing, like

00:41:51.175,00:41:55.713
it would be ridiculous right? So
you could you could start using
that uh color sensor.You could

00:41:55.713,00:41:59.684
use that to get feedback on
where the fingers are
potentially uh all sorts of

00:41:59.684,00:42:04.255
things. You could um actually
like you implement analog input
you could you know control the

00:42:04.255,00:42:08.626
uh you know the speed and all
that stuff. Umm you know just
using a microcontroller would be

00:42:08.626,00:42:14.332
really simple, um of course I I
didn't have that luxury here. Um
but yeah you can um do all this

00:42:14.332,00:42:18.536
cool stuff. So what's next for
this the Keurig stuff? Um I want
to look at like water filtration

00:42:18.536,00:42:22.874
and purification. I want to look
at cooking, I think that'd be
fun. Uh I think uh there's some

00:42:22.874,00:42:27.178
like i- interesting applications
for gardening maybe some
hydroponics? Uhh I would like to

00:42:27.178,00:42:31.449
build an aquarium 'cause that'd
be funny. Um meta what ab- what
about like building something

00:42:31.449,00:42:35.753
that would help you build other
stuff? Eh? Uh but one thing that
I I've actually started on and

00:42:35.753,00:42:40.658
and got some headway going here
are uh firearms. So I might be
the first person to actually

00:42:40.658,00:42:45.229
shoot a Keurig. Uh so where do
we go from here? Uh real quick
'cause we're we're like short on

00:42:45.229,00:42:51.102
time. Guys the stuff surrounding
us all the time has like huge
amounts of potential. Huge! Like

00:42:51.102,00:42:57.208
everybody everybody long pants
long pants right.Humongous. And
um if the if the thing that like

00:42:57.208,00:43:00.778
gives you like mediocre coffee
every day could could actually
like help someone pick something

00:43:00.778,00:43:05.483
up who normally couldn't like
like that that represents a huge
gap in in like what we're using

00:43:05.483,00:43:08.953
it for and what what the act-
actual potential this thing is,
right?So, um frequent

00:43:08.953,00:43:14.892
Macgyvering it it lets you, it
let's your brain naturally find
more uh interesting and and

00:43:14.892,00:43:19.464
clever solutions to everyday
problems. It's just a good like
mental exercise. Uhh also if

00:43:19.464,00:43:23.301
you're stubborn enough,
everything is sandpaper
[audience laughs] [coughs].And

00:43:23.301,00:43:26.904
winter is coming! So [sighs] for
this project it was it was all
it was almost two hundred two

00:43:26.904,00:43:29.273
hundred hours long and like the
first part was great 'cause I
got the fingers going and I was

00:43:29.273,00:43:32.577
like "yeah fingers!" And now I'm
like aw crap now I've gotta like
actually make make this work

00:43:32.577,00:43:37.348
consistently and like, you know
like drudge through the the slow
and tedious parts and you know

00:43:37.348,00:43:42.520
fail and try things again and
all that stuff so. That was umm
that was tough. And it's it's

00:43:42.520,00:43:47.625
good to it's good to know that
going in and like get mentally
prepared for it just so you can

00:43:47.625,00:43:53.064
actually finish finish the
project right? Uh big one is man
take everything apart. This is a

00:43:53.064,00:43:59.904
huge skill. I don't care if it's
yours or not, I'm not the police
but dude like like if you get a

00:43:59.904,00:44:03.541
enough experience with this
thing right. Taking something
apart will eventually become

00:44:03.541,00:44:08.246
like having a conversation with
the engineer who built it. Which
is pretty cool, because like as

00:44:08.246,00:44:11.949
I'm taking stuff apart I'm like
"Why is this here?" Like "Ohhh
this is this is pressure fit I

00:44:11.949,00:44:15.720
don't have to use any screws
here, that that's great."So yeah
um I wanted to thank a few

00:44:15.720,00:44:19.624
awesome people real quick. Uh my
mom first and foremost. The the
the time lapse video, I knew I

00:44:19.624,00:44:24.328
wanted Clair De Lune in it
'cause that's one of my favorite
like Vegas songs, I- for a lot

00:44:24.328,00:44:28.799
of reasons, and um it's actually
in public domain but all the
recordings uh were were kinda

00:44:28.799,00:44:34.672
pricey. Uh my mom is uh a a
pianist um and so I eh my wife
had the idea was like "call your

00:44:34.672,00:44:39.310
mom" I was like "ehh y'know eh
okay" and she like ran off in a
storm and recorded that for me.

00:44:39.310,00:44:43.214
And uh that will be available in
the public domain uh if you guys
wanna download it. Uh I'll put a

00:44:43.214,00:44:48.219
link in my twitter. Eventually.
Umm [audience applauds]Yeah
thanks mom. [applause]Uh Dan

00:44:51.055,00:44:56.060
Teller right here umm he he let
me borrow his uh thermal cam for
like like months and uh and last

00:44:58.262,00:45:02.900
night I was like you know I had
an I need some Vegas footage
here. It was like nine o'clock.

00:45:02.900,00:45:06.871
I was like Dan, do you wanna
shoot some stuff? And a couple
like a couple drinks later it

00:45:06.871,00:45:11.876
was like two AM we had some like
freakin' amazing footage so
thanks for that, Dan. Uh my

00:45:11.876,00:45:14.779
brother Taylor he would uh be
available on the phone for like
electronics questions he's an EE

00:45:14.779,00:45:19.383
and all that stuff. And most of
all you guys, right? So I"m
talking to you guys and uh and

00:45:19.383,00:45:23.321
you guys absolutely blow me away
with the stuff you're working
on. And like and the struggles

00:45:23.321,00:45:26.757
that you're going through with
it and I it occurs to me that
like, a lot of you you probably

00:45:26.757,00:45:31.062
like carrying the flag, you know
all by yourself on a lotta this
stuff. And a lot of this stuffs

00:45:31.062,00:45:34.932
like all your projects are
really important. Even like your
side projects. So I just wanna

00:45:34.932,00:45:39.337
encourage you guys like like
like, keep your head up with
that. Like even if the the

00:45:39.337,00:45:43.808
number of people supporting you
is zero like, that's alright,
you know? Come to these things

00:45:43.808,00:45:49.480
and find people who who get you
and help you you know be you and
and like get your get your

00:45:49.480,00:45:54.485
awesome projects going. So. Guys
thanks so much go build some
stuff. [audience applauds

00:45:56.921,00:45:59.590
heartily] Awesome!
