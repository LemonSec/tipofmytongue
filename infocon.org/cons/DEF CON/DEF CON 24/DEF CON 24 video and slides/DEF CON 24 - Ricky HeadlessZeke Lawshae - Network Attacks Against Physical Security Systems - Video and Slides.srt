00:00:00.000-->00:00:05.005
>>Let's, er, let's give Zeke a
big round of applause.
[applause] Rock 'n roll, have a

00:00:08.876-->00:00:14.181
good time. >>Thanks. Okay, er,
so I think we're about, er, out
of time... [laughter] thank you

00:00:14.181-->00:00:19.186
everybody for coming out. Er, so
yeah, so, so my name is, erm,
Ricky "HeadlessZeke". Uhm, this

00:00:21.655-->00:00:25.759
was my talk and erm, let's just
get right into it. Er, [hums]
to-do-do-do. Okay so, er, I'm a

00:00:25.759-->00:00:30.797
security researcher at, er,
Tipping Point DB Labs, now er, a
Trendmicro Tipping Point, erm

00:00:30.797-->00:00:35.369
until just recently HPE and
before that HP, and before that
3com. Erm, I wasn't there during

00:00:35.369-->00:00:40.374
that time that, er, whatever,
erm...most of my hacking, erm,
involves things that I find

00:00:45.312-->00:00:50.317
lying around the house and
things that I have easy access
to, which ends up being a lot of

00:00:54.388-->00:01:00.827
I.O.T. things. Erm, this is
actually, erm my third time, er,
speaking at DefCon. Erm, my

00:01:00.827-->00:01:05.832
first time with an actual Defcon
beard. Erm, thank you. [laughs].
Erm, so yeah, but I've spoken at

00:01:09.970-->00:01:15.976
like Ruxcon, ReCon, er,
Insomi'hack, erm and I actually
used to install physical

00:01:15.976-->00:01:22.482
security systems for a living,
er, which is, erm, kind of where
part of my motivation came from

00:01:22.482-->00:01:27.454
for doing this talk. Uhm, my
first ever talk period was at
Defcon. It was a little

00:01:27.454-->00:01:32.459
lightening talk about a super
overly complicated attack that I
found in HIV card readers. Erm,

00:01:36.630-->00:01:43.236
it was like, er, TCP reader
type, where you like capture a
remote unlock command and then

00:01:43.236-->00:01:48.275
reinject it into the session
later on. And then you can
reopen that same door for that

00:01:48.275-->00:01:53.046
same period of time. But I
couldn't compose my own unlock
commands, so it was really

00:01:53.046-->00:01:59.953
humiliating and I feel like I
could do better and er I did, so
that's why I'm here. Erm, but I

00:01:59.953-->00:02:06.560
also, erm, had a conversation
with a friend or two, er, about
how cool it would be able to

00:02:06.560-->00:02:12.499
like mess with video streams and
stuff. And erm, so, erm, I
started, I started kinda

00:02:12.499-->00:02:17.504
formulating an idea of a talk
and here we are. Er, so, erm...
I'm trying to decide what all I

00:02:21.341-->00:02:26.346
should skip through since we are
all so behind in time. Erm, so
physical security, erm,

00:02:29.016-->00:02:34.521
basically, it's, er, just a way
to protect yourf valuable assets
and your facilities. Erm, er,

00:02:34.521-->00:02:39.526
when I talk about physical
security, I'm talking about
access control so that the

00:02:42.029-->00:02:47.034
reader stuff, er, surveillance
and alarms. Erm, so basically no
matter how big your organization

00:02:49.669-->00:02:55.942
is, your got some kind of
physical security, erm, whether
it's just like, you know a

00:02:55.942-->00:03:00.881
manual, physical lock on a door,
or, erm, what-whatever it is,
erm, it's in, it's in every

00:03:04.117-->00:03:10.724
single organization. Erm, but
the larger the organization, er,
the more unattainable the

00:03:10.724-->00:03:17.564
managing of a physical security
system becomes. Erm, so piece by
piece, erm, people are starting

00:03:17.564-->00:03:23.470
move it to the network, er, to
make remote management really
easy and really convenient. Erm,

00:03:23.470-->00:03:30.177
but with that convenience, erm,
comes the worries of, you know,
network attacks and, and things

00:03:30.177-->00:03:35.182
like that. Er ,ssht, ssht,
shht,, sshht so what you end up
with is: you've got these

00:03:38.518-->00:03:44.324
embedded devices, erm that are
accessible via the network. And
they are protecting all of your

00:03:44.324-->00:03:49.329
valuable assets. And they're in
every single organization out
there, erm, so, you should take

00:03:53.333-->00:03:58.338
a look at them. Alright so,
access control is er, by far the
most complicated piece of this

00:04:02.709-->00:04:07.714
puzzle. Erm, so, it's erm, I'm
going to go, go through it in
detail, to describe, erm, like

00:04:10.217-->00:04:16.356
the layout of every thing. Erm,
but basically you've got your,
er, locking mechanism...hang on,

00:04:16.356-->00:04:21.361
I'm goon grab a [inaudible]. Er,
so you got your, your, er,
locking mechanism, erm, which is

00:04:23.497-->00:04:28.502
is what keeps the door from
being able to open. I.D.
mechanism: which lets you open

00:04:30.637-->00:04:35.642
the door. Erm, and then you
going to have various, er,
sensors and, erm, [beeping

00:04:37.944-->00:04:42.949
noise] erm, oh, sorry. I just
[laughs] that was the equivalent
of me forcing open the door. Er,

00:04:42.949-->00:04:48.355
so I'm going to have to
acknowledge that alarm. Maybe,
I'll just power cycle it. Hang

00:04:48.355-->00:04:53.360
on. [laughs]. Sorry door. Okay,
and then of course you've got
some management software, erm,

00:04:56.463-->00:05:00.400
on a remote terminal somewhere,
er, that when somebody says
like: "Hey, I forgot my I.D."

00:05:00.400-->00:05:05.405
erm, you can buzz them in, or
can push down, schedule changes
and things like that. Alright,

00:05:09.409-->00:05:15.682
so a little bit, a little bit
more detail about, about the
door, erm. When I'm talking,

00:05:15.682-->00:05:21.621
when I'm talking about the I.D.
reader, erm that covers the
entire span of like, of like,

00:05:21.621-->00:05:28.161
you know, from the low end like
pin pad and mag stripe readers
to the high end like biometric

00:05:28.161-->00:05:33.800
retinal scanners and things like
that. Erm, then got what's
called the request to exit,

00:05:33.800-->00:05:38.972
which's what lets the door know
that somebody is leaving from
the secured side, so even though

00:05:38.972-->00:05:45.278
you don't see, erm like a, erm,
a card read or anything like
that, it's okay for them to open

00:05:45.278-->00:05:50.884
the door because they were
already inside. Erm, the door
contact is the magnet that shows

00:05:50.884-->00:05:55.889
whether the door is open or
closed. Erm, the lock or strike
is, er, the locking mechanism.

00:05:58.491-->00:06:03.430
Blah, blah, blah. Erm, most
important part is, er, the door
controller. Are you guys

00:06:05.799-->00:06:10.804
following along well with this
slides with the way I'm doing
'em? Okay. Erm, so the most

00:06:10.804-->00:06:15.809
important part for my purposes,
erm was the door controller,
erm, which is, is the part that,

00:06:17.877-->00:06:24.451
erm, holds a local copy of the
database. Erm, all the other
pieces of the door wire into it

00:06:24.451-->00:06:29.456
and that's what's connected to
the network. Er, so here's a a
diagram of how that all wires

00:06:32.492-->00:06:38.565
together. Erm, you see above,
above the door, in the middle
you've got a passive infrared,

00:06:38.565-->00:06:44.037
that's your request to exit or
rex. Erm that's just a motion
sensor that says say somebody's

00:06:44.037-->00:06:48.608
walkin' up to the door and you
got a little magnet on top of
the door, you got a lock on the

00:06:48.608-->00:06:53.613
side of the door, reader on the
side of the door. Erm, hang
on...[some clapping] [laughs]

00:06:56.216-->00:07:01.154
erm, all of that is what's wired
into the door controller, which
then goes out into the cloud.

00:07:03.790-->00:07:08.795
Or, you know, the, er, LAN or
whatever. Alright, so let's
cover some attack factors. Erm,

00:07:13.533-->00:07:20.540
first I'll start by talking
about some existing things in,
erm things that aren't really

00:07:20.540-->00:07:27.480
network based, erm, so like, I'm
sure you all heard a lot about
RFID spoofing and er, brute

00:07:27.480-->00:07:32.352
forcing pin numbers, and even
like pulling the reader off the
wall and tapping into the

00:07:32.352-->00:07:37.357
wegman's data lines, and brute
forcing the pulses, erm, for a
valid I.D. Erm, so there are a

00:07:40.360-->00:07:45.365
lot of attack factors there.
Most of them, er, seem, erm, I
guess RFID spoofing isn't that,

00:07:50.070-->00:07:55.208
erm , like cloning cards, erm
isn't that hard to pull off. But
like, if you're talking about

00:07:55.208-->00:07:59.979
yanking a reader off a wall,
it's kind of destructive and
obvious. Erm, so there's some

00:07:59.979-->00:08:04.918
funny attacks on request to
exits. So, erm, erm have any of
you guys seen, er, I think it's

00:08:07.053-->00:08:13.693
rift recon, they got that like
loop on a stick thing? Where you
like reach underneath the door

00:08:13.693-->00:08:20.367
and hook on to the inside
handle? And then you pull down
and it opens the door? Erm,

00:08:20.367-->00:08:25.939
hilarious things like that and
tripping motion sensors and
stuff. Erm, of course you could

00:08:25.939-->00:08:31.711
attack the management software
if it's running on a vulnerable
host or if it's an unsecured

00:08:31.711-->00:08:38.318
database. Erm, a little, a
little unpredictable. Erm, or:
we could go after the door

00:08:38.318-->00:08:42.455
controller because it's a
network connected embedded
device which is notoriously bad

00:08:42.455-->00:08:48.561
with security. And every single
piece of the door is wired into
it, so it has, it's basically

00:08:48.561-->00:08:54.868
like an embedded device that has
a bunch of software controlled
relays on it. So, if you can

00:08:54.868-->00:08:59.873
control the device, you can
control the relays. Erm, so
let's focus on the door

00:09:03.176-->00:09:08.181
controller now. Erm, basically
the way I see it, there are er,
two main ways that we could

00:09:10.850-->00:09:16.389
after this thing. Erm, you guys
can probably think of way more,
but, erm...so the first, erm,

00:09:16.389-->00:09:21.394
and probably most obvious is,
er, API exposure. Erm, so if you
can see, kind of like what I did

00:09:24.464-->00:09:29.469
with, with my er, little rinky
dink Defcon talk, erm, where if
you can see an unlock command go

00:09:32.205-->00:09:37.210
into the door, erm, and you can
replay it later on, erm, but,
er, so, I do wanna talk a little

00:09:42.515-->00:09:47.520
bit about this PSIA. Which is,
er, a an inter- operability
standard that, erm, is starting

00:09:50.323-->00:09:55.328
to take off a little bit. Erm, I
should say that this, this is
strictly speculation. I don't

00:09:58.364-->00:10:02.836
have, access, er, to a
controller that implements this
standard, but just reading

00:10:02.836-->00:10:07.574
through the spec, it looks like
something I'd like to take a
look at. Erm, because it's based

00:10:07.574-->00:10:12.579
on, erm, HTTP requests to URIs.
I saw this one, er, access
override URI, that erm, its used

00:10:17.784-->00:10:22.789
for like, er, like if there's an
incident at a facility and you
need to like either unlock all

00:10:24.824-->00:10:29.829
the doors or lock, lock off some
areas. Erm you can override the
access schedule by er, sending a

00:10:32.365-->00:10:37.370
port request to the access
override URI and, erm set the
access override state to unlatch

00:10:40.206-->00:10:45.211
and then would unlock all of the
doors just like that. Erm, it
had mentioned erm, something

00:10:48.248-->00:10:53.186
about having like er, I'm
starting to run out of breath
[laughing] going through this so

00:10:53.186-->00:10:58.191
fast. Erm, so it had, it had
mentioned having like I.D.
number in the request, erm, to

00:11:02.428-->00:11:08.034
use as an authentication
mechanism. Erm, but that was
just in the spec and, you know,

00:11:08.034-->00:11:13.039
individual implementations may
vary. Okay, on the other hand,
erm, you could look for running

00:11:16.910-->00:11:21.915
services since it's a network
device. Erm, so they usually
have like an on-board management

00:11:25.418-->00:11:30.423
system. Erm, if I had my display
working I would show what this,
what the on-board management

00:11:32.659-->00:11:37.664
system looked like on this guy.
Erm, but, erm so that's one
thing, you know, usual web app

00:11:41.234-->00:11:48.141
attacks. Erm, or you could look
for er, like standard Unix
services and lynix services that

00:11:48.141-->00:11:52.378
are just out of date because
they have haven't been keeping
up with patching and other

00:11:52.378-->00:11:58.651
services that are running on
their device. Erm and also they
are a great place for, er

00:11:58.651-->00:12:03.590
fuzzing proprietary services
that haven't been examined very
closely. Which is what I did.

00:12:06.526-->00:12:11.531
Erm, so, erm, this is a HID door
controller. Erm every single one
of HID's door controllers across

00:12:15.468-->00:12:21.574
their entire product line was
running a service called
"discoveryd" which is a way to

00:12:21.574-->00:12:28.081
send out, erm a UDP packet to
the broadcaster address and
every door controller on the

00:12:28.081-->00:12:33.019
network would then send a packet
back to you that said like:
yeah, like here I am, here's all

00:12:33.019-->00:12:38.024
my info, er blah, blah, blah,
blah. Erm, but that, that was
the only, that was the only

00:12:41.494-->00:12:47.166
purpose of the service from what
I could tell, but it wasn't the
only function of the service.

00:12:47.166-->00:12:52.171
Erm, there was also, er, an
undocumented command called:
command, command "Blink On" erm,

00:12:54.474-->00:12:59.479
that, er, excuse me. So the
command "Blink On" erm it took a
number of times as an argument

00:13:06.552-->00:13:13.259
and, and that, that number of
times was, er, how many times to
blink the LED on the door

00:13:13.259-->00:13:19.399
controller. And the way that
worked was that they would build
up a path to the blink binary

00:13:19.399-->00:13:24.404
and then send, erm, send that
path and that number you just
gave it, erm, and call system on

00:13:28.441-->00:13:33.446
it when no sanitation at all on
the, on the er user attacker
supplied information. Erm, so it

00:13:37.550-->00:13:43.523
was vulnerable to a command
injection and, erm, in the
discoveryd service was running

00:13:43.523-->00:13:48.528
that room. So this was, erm
across the entire product line
like the: verdex, Edge, Ebo.

00:13:51.364-->00:13:57.503
Their entire product line was
vulnerable to this. But, erm, it
has been patched, er, since I

00:13:57.503-->00:14:02.442
think like late March or April.
Erm, you can actually, er find
these door controllers erm on

00:14:04.977-->00:14:11.317
Show Down, er I don't know why
anybody would ever put their
doors, erm, on the internet, but

00:14:11.317-->00:14:17.023
they're there and there's like
over 300 hundred – last time I
checked. And erm, the patch

00:14:17.023-->00:14:22.028
rate, erm, is really low...
[laughs] even though the patch
has been available for a while.

00:14:24.964-->00:14:29.969
Erm, so there's that. Er,
surveillance is a lot simpler.
Er, so you usually have, er, a

00:14:33.606-->00:14:38.811
video camera inside there's
gonna be an IP camera all
hardwired erm. And then you

00:14:38.811-->00:14:44.717
gonna have some recording device
like a VCR / DVR and then again
some kind of management

00:14:44.717-->00:14:50.690
software. So, same deal as
before with the management
software. As far as attack

00:14:50.690-->00:14:55.695
factors go, erm, the DVR gets a
little more interesting erm
there have been some attacks

00:14:59.198-->00:15:04.137
recently about erm, being able
to dump, erm, creds to login to
DVRs and and things like that.

00:15:07.306-->00:15:13.412
Er, you could also maybe try
DOS-ing the DVR so the camera
can't reach it. If it's an IP

00:15:13.412-->00:15:18.417
camera and avoid, er, recording.
Erm you can also do the same
thing with DOS-ing the camera.

00:15:21.454-->00:15:28.094
Erm, but, erm what would be way
cooler is if you could man-in
the-middle the video stream, er,

00:15:28.094-->00:15:33.099
since it's a, since it's a IP
camera and it's just streaming
across the network. Erm, so,

00:15:36.235-->00:15:41.607
let's take a look at that, erm.
This demo I'm definitely not
going to be able to show you

00:15:41.607-->00:15:46.078
with my display not working.
Which is a shame because that's
the one I was really proud of.

00:15:46.078-->00:15:51.083
Erm, but so, so most of them,
most video streams are going to
be either RTP or motion jpeg.

00:15:54.654-->00:15:59.091
Erm, haven't seen a lot of
encryption although it's
starting to catch on a little

00:15:59.091-->00:16:04.030
bit. Erm the basic idea here is,
er, when you see a frame you er,
you grab it, you modify it in

00:16:08.968-->00:16:14.407
whatever way you want and then
you forward it on. Erm, and that
allows you to do things like,

00:16:14.407-->00:16:19.412
er, like, you would see in the
movies, like, you know, loop X
number of playback seconds, you

00:16:21.981-->00:16:27.386
know. So, you like record,
record like 3 seconds of
playback and then like jump and

00:16:27.386-->00:16:32.391
just replaying it over and over
again. Erm, or you could, er,
cut the feed by just replacing

00:16:35.628-->00:16:40.633
all the images you see with the
fuzzy static. Erm, one, one cool
thing that I did, er, er, are

00:16:42.835-->00:16:47.840
there any fans of 'Ghost in the
shell' in the audience? Yeah, so
I used erm, I used open CV to do

00:16:56.015-->00:17:00.953
face, face detection, erm on the
images I was, that were going
through and then I would replace

00:17:03.089-->00:17:09.595
that face with laughing man
logo, erm so I could actually
like get him in frame and my

00:17:09.595-->00:17:14.600
face would be covered with the
laughing man thing, erm, if you
guys wanna, you know, whenever,

00:17:17.403-->00:17:22.909
if you see me out there
somewhere, erm I can run through
these, er, demos for you then.

00:17:22.909-->00:17:27.914
Erm, I guess I could, I could
still show you the card reader
attack. I'll do that. Erm. Okay

00:17:31.417-->00:17:36.989
so yeah, the the camera that I
was working with was a Ubiquiti
coding cam. It's a couple

00:17:36.989-->00:17:40.226
generations old but my friend
let me borrow it, erm, and erm,
the latest firmware, they

00:17:40.226-->00:17:42.228
actually got rid of RTP, erm,
which made things a lot easier.
They were just doing motion jpeg

00:17:42.228-->00:17:44.230
so like all I had to do was
write some custom plug-ins for
erm, for man-in-the-middle

00:17:44.230-->00:17:49.235
proxy, erm to handle the images
and it was super duper easy. Er,
oh, also I should mention, I'm

00:18:02.148-->00:18:07.853
not, I'm not calling out
Ubiquiti there's not like a valm
in their camera this is them

00:18:07.853-->00:18:12.858
they're agnostic erm , so don't,
don't sue me. And then alarms,
of course. Erm, so we got like

00:18:18.230-->00:18:23.235
fire, fire alarms, er tamper
sensors, motion sensors, bah,
bah, bah. I'm starting to run

00:18:27.206-->00:18:32.211
out of time. Erm, so one cool
thing that you could do with
erm, with the, erm, networked,

00:18:36.248-->00:18:41.253
er, fire panel, is erm, you
could cause a, a false positive.
Or a false alarm in one area as

00:18:45.458-->00:18:52.331
like a distraction for what like
you are trying to do in another
area. Something like that. Erm,

00:18:52.331-->00:18:57.336
motion sensor is probably the
easiest thing you would have to
deal with. Erm, because if they

00:19:00.673-->00:19:06.879
can't send their alarms, erm,
then they're useless. Erm, so if
you can either, erm, just

00:19:06.879-->00:19:13.819
straight up DOS, straight up DOS
the, erm, motion sensor and then
like if its sending out a

00:19:13.819-->00:19:19.725
heartbeat to say like I'm still
alive, then you have to spoof
the heartbeat or you could like

00:19:19.725-->00:19:24.897
just selectively DOS if they're
not using any encryption and you
can recognise the alarms, just

00:19:24.897-->00:19:30.202
selectively not let those alarms
through. And the that's all
there is to it. Erm, this

00:19:30.202-->00:19:35.207
doesn't make any sense since I'm
not able to do any of my demos,
but erm I, I ran out of time

00:19:38.978-->00:19:43.983
trying to configure my erm, so I
got erm, I got an IOT motion
sensor, erm, that just was not

00:19:47.620-->00:19:52.625
pairing with its management
software. Erm, so I ran out of
time trying to get that demo

00:19:52.625-->00:19:57.630
working. Okay, so here was the
hypothetical scenario that I had
set up, that I was going to pull

00:20:00.599-->00:20:06.539
off for my demo section. Erm,
typical, typical office, they've
got a card reader on the

00:20:06.539-->00:20:11.410
unsecured side and a door
controller on the secured side.
They've got a video camera

00:20:11.410-->00:20:16.415
watching the entire office and
then like, like you do, you've
got the, the Hope diamond in all

00:20:18.617-->00:20:25.524
of the CEOs credit card info
laying out on your desk. Erm,
because you can, you're, you're

00:20:25.524-->00:20:30.930
totally secured. Erm, so I'm
gonna, I'm gonna hop over to
this machine real quick, I don't

00:20:30.930-->00:20:37.636
know if those mics are on or
not. Erm, but erm, so I won't be
able to show you the video

00:20:37.636-->00:20:42.808
camera stuff because don't have
a display, erm, but I will be
able to show you, show you, er,

00:20:42.808-->00:20:47.813
sending my exploit to
permanently unlock, unlock the
door, so bear with me. [taps

00:20:59.525-->00:21:04.463
mic] hey, it does work. Okay so,
erm, I can't show you the code,
but erm, basically there, there

00:21:09.101-->00:21:14.140
was a er a CGI script that was
running on this thing, or it was
a complied binary, erm, that

00:21:14.140-->00:21:16.142
handled sending, sending all of
the settings to the relays to
control their state. Erm, and

00:21:16.142-->00:21:18.144
so, I, I just er, sent it the
"unlocked" state and then
removed "execute permissions"

00:21:18.144-->00:21:23.149
from that, from that CGI binary.
Erm so that it unlocked the door
and wouldn't let you relock it.

00:21:36.362-->00:21:41.367
Erm, and since, since this works
on, er, you can find all the
door controllers erm by sending

00:21:44.403-->00:21:50.309
a packet to broadcast. Erm, I
just like send out that
broadcast probe and then iterate

00:21:50.309-->00:21:55.781
through al ofl the door
controllers that come back. And
I can permanently unlock every

00:21:55.781-->00:22:00.719
single door on, in an entire
facility. Er, so hang on one
second. [beeping sound] Okay,

00:22:03.422-->00:22:08.427
er, hang on that's not the good
part. Erm so it's just injecting
commands over and over again

00:22:12.598-->00:22:17.603
because there was like a
character limit on the, erm,
erm, how big the packet...okay,

00:22:24.310-->00:22:29.315
so now, so now the door, now the
door is permanently locked, er
and this, permanently unlocked,

00:22:31.850-->00:22:37.556
and this is where I would have
brought up the management
portal, erm to, to click on the

00:22:37.556-->00:22:44.063
re- lock button and show you
that it wasn't re- locking. Er,
so yeah there's, there's that

00:22:44.063-->00:22:49.068
and it's not as impressive as I
had originally planned out, but
these things happen. [applause]

00:22:51.937-->00:22:56.942
Thank you. Okay and then that
camera thing was gonna be like,
like erm, you know, loop,

00:23:02.114-->00:23:06.785
looping the playbacks so that
you can like walk in front of
the camera without being seen

00:23:06.785-->00:23:13.626
and stuff like that. Erm, so
there's that. Okay, so let's
talk a little bit quickly about,

00:23:13.626-->00:23:19.898
erm about mitigations. Erm, so
first off, most obviously is
what segregates these devices

00:23:19.898-->00:23:26.138
erm from your normal network
traffic. Make it so that use
regular Joe Blows on your

00:23:26.138-->00:23:32.645
network can't reach these
devices. Erm, also I, if if the
network that you've got them on

00:23:32.645-->00:23:37.650
is very, erm, static and erm,
predictable. You can look for
anomylous activity pretty

00:23:40.486-->00:23:46.058
easily. Erm, keep on top of
firmware updates, which is
actually an interesting problem

00:23:46.058-->00:23:51.063
with these kinds of situations,
especially with like the, er,
the erm, access control system

00:23:54.667-->00:23:59.672
where you know, once upon a time
IT handled computers and like
facilities or whatever handles,

00:24:02.942-->00:24:07.946
er, locks. Erm, but what do you
do when it's both? You know, so
you have to clearly define who

00:24:10.282-->00:24:16.188
owns what and who gonna be in
charge of updates and things
like that. Erm, also think

00:24:16.188-->00:24:21.193
before you link. And erm, as,
you know, I think I give this
advice in like every single one

00:24:25.664-->00:24:31.503
of my talks, but like hack
yourself. That's how you learn
what you're vulnerable to and,

00:24:31.503-->00:24:36.508
erm, how your overall security
posture looks. Erm, third part
resalers, so erm a lot of this

00:24:40.112-->00:24:45.117
stuff is really, erm, closed off
to the just the general masses.
Erm, but third party resalers,

00:24:47.519-->00:24:52.524
erm are a little looser. Erm
like I bought, I bought this
entire rig pre-assembled, erm

00:24:54.727-->00:24:59.765
from a company I'm not going to
name because I don't know what
their opinion of me naming them

00:24:59.765-->00:25:04.803
in a Defcon talk would be, er
maybe talk to me afterwards, but
yeah, it was like 300 bucks for

00:25:04.803-->00:25:09.808
that entire pre-assembled demo
door system. Erm, also, I was
able to find some, some firmware

00:25:12.778-->00:25:17.783
images that I wouldn't have been
otherwise able to get access to.
Erm, I'm a bah bah, okay so

00:25:21.353-->00:25:26.358
yeah, that's basically it. Sorry
I had to rush and not show my
fantastic demos but erm, if you

00:25:31.964-->00:25:37.002
ever are interested in any of
the code or, or have any
questions, things that I didn't

00:25:37.002-->00:25:42.674
have time to go over properly or
anything like that, I have an
email and a Twitter and I'm way

00:25:42.674-->00:25:47.679
more responsive on Twitter than
I am on email. Er, so, yeah. Hit
me up! [applause]
