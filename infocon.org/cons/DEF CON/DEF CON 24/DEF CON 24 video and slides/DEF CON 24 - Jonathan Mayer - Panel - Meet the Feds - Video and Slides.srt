00:00:00.000-->00:00:05.005
>>Good morning >>Sound off John
>>uh I it it's great to see so
many folks um uh great to see so

00:00:12.112-->00:00:18.318
many folks here uh uh standing
room only in the back uh so uh
we're here from the government

00:00:18.318-->00:00:23.323
and we're here to help
[cheering] uh my names uh
Jonathan Mayer I'm chief

00:00:26.360-->00:00:31.231
technologist for the federal
communications commission's uh
enforcement bureau uh I'm joined

00:00:31.231-->00:00:34.434
by wonderful colleagues
throughout the federal
government uh we have Lorrie

00:00:34.434-->00:00:39.239
Cranor who is chief technologist
of the federal trade commission,
uh Eric Mill who's a senior

00:00:39.239-->00:00:45.712
engineer at 18F in the general
services administration uh and
Allan Friedman who's director of

00:00:45.712-->00:00:50.717
cyber security initiatives at
the national telecommunications
and information administration

00:00:53.287-->00:00:57.658
[inaudible yelling from
audience] alright let me try a
little louder and with apologies

00:00:57.658-->00:01:02.095
to the folks who are near
speakers uh uh and Allan
Friedman down at the far end who

00:01:02.095-->00:01:07.301
is director of cyber security
initiatives at NTIA uh within
the department of commerce ah so

00:01:07.301-->00:01:11.571
it's a great cross section of
different technology policy
roles within the federal

00:01:11.571-->00:01:17.311
government um uh we have uh uh
working on cyber security in the
main component of the executive

00:01:17.311-->00:01:21.748
branch we have delivering
services uh throughout the
government uh we have uh

00:01:21.748-->00:01:25.385
independent agency working on
security and privacy issues real
thought leader within the

00:01:25.385-->00:01:30.390
government um and then we've got
the FCC um [laughter] uh >>yay
>>So I'm going to ask uh each of

00:01:33.260-->00:01:39.700
our participants to to say a few
words uh about their agency and
what the agency's been working

00:01:39.700-->00:01:43.870
on in technology policy and the
role in the agency uh and then
for the most part this is going

00:01:43.870-->00:01:49.009
to be an extended Q and A
session uh it's up to you to
lead the conversation uh there

00:01:49.009-->00:01:53.513
are microphones to the left and
the right of the room uh please
line up uh and have your

00:01:53.513-->00:01:58.552
questions ready uh and uh my
game plan is to just alternate
um and and we'll do our best to

00:01:58.552-->00:02:05.459
answer okay so Lorrie could you
start? >>Hi good morning um so
the the federal trade commission

00:02:05.459-->00:02:12.165
uh focuses on consumer
protection and in the security
and privacy space we're very

00:02:12.165-->00:02:17.170
much interested in protected
consumers from having their
private information breached and

00:02:19.506-->00:02:24.511
leaked um we're we're interested
in protecting them from unfair
and deceptive practices scams

00:02:26.780-->00:02:31.785
fraud also spam robocalls these
are all things that we are very
interested in um investigating

00:02:35.756-->00:02:40.761
and in finding ways to protect
consumers we also do outreach to
consumers about how they can

00:02:43.163-->00:02:48.168
protect themselves and avoid
falling for some of these scams
um we are very interested in

00:02:52.005-->00:02:57.310
talking to researches and if you
come to our session at one pm we
will get into more detail about

00:02:57.310-->00:03:02.249
that but we we would like to
work with the researcher and
hacker community to identify uh

00:03:06.319-->00:03:13.260
vulnerabilities that we need to
be aware of to identify tools
that we can use that consumers

00:03:13.260-->00:03:18.265
can use um and so uh we
encourage you to come talk to us
we've also set up an email

00:03:20.767-->00:03:25.772
address research at ftc dot gov
uh where you can send us um the
things that you've discovered

00:03:28.475-->00:03:34.381
that that you would like us to
know about uh we also have a
number of events that are coming

00:03:34.381-->00:03:39.386
up this fall that uh we are um
going to be interested in having
researchers attend um they're

00:03:42.255-->00:03:48.929
going to be open to the public
as well as webcast so we have a
workshop coming up on drones we

00:03:48.929-->00:03:53.934
have one coming up on smart TVs
uh we have one coming up on um
disclosures uh so privacy

00:03:56.103-->00:04:01.942
notices are one form of
disclosure but other kinds of
disclosures as well uh a bunch

00:04:01.942-->00:04:08.248
of things and then in January we
will have our privacy con event
you can read about all of these

00:04:08.248-->00:04:13.253
things at ftc dot gov slash tech
thank you. >>Sure so uh I'm I'm
Eric Mill uh and I'm with a

00:04:17.157-->00:04:24.131
group relatively a new group in
the federal government called
18F it's like one eight f and uh

00:04:24.131-->00:04:27.801
we're about two years old and
we're housed in the most
excitingly named agency in the

00:04:27.801-->00:04:34.174
federal government the general
services administration and we
uh so we're about a couple of

00:04:34.174-->00:04:40.313
hundred people mostly not in DC
and we are trying to do
technology right in the federal

00:04:40.313-->00:04:45.385
government so we actually have
dozens of engineers product
people ux people design folks

00:04:45.385-->00:04:50.590
security people and we are
trying to make sure the
government can do well for

00:04:50.590-->00:04:55.829
itself on technology and that uh
that to make sure the government
can do things the way that we

00:04:55.829-->00:05:01.568
all want to do things we can
embrace the cloud use open
source do agile development uh

00:05:01.568-->00:05:05.739
we can bake in privacy and
security from the beginning of
the of the development process

00:05:05.739-->00:05:11.444
so we we try to lead through uh
implementation and delivery uh
we do some some of the things

00:05:11.444-->00:05:15.849
that are maybe most relevant to
this crowd um so we're uh
currently working on getting a

00:05:15.849-->00:05:21.288
bug bounty program started on
our on a number of our public
facing systems um shout out to

00:05:21.288-->00:05:25.559
DOD who just uh did the first
government bug bounty program
fairly recently uh hack the

00:05:25.559-->00:05:31.598
pentagon definitely learned a
lot from them um we're also uh
trying to hire and it's the

00:05:31.598-->00:05:34.968
government does in in fact
employ information security
professionals we're trying to do

00:05:34.968-->00:05:40.273
it a little bit differently and
hire uh people that are senior
technical implementers that

00:05:40.273-->00:05:44.411
don't require security clearance
and put them at work on a
variety of government wide

00:05:44.411-->00:05:50.584
systems uh that that make the
country work better um and then
in particular um part of my work

00:05:50.584-->00:05:56.089
there is focused a lot on on
encryption and uh in particular
18F has been a really animating

00:05:56.089-->00:06:01.761
force on web encryption on HTTPS
in particular um there actually
is a federal policy mandate

00:06:01.761-->00:06:06.366
right now in the executive
branch to move everything to
HTTPS only with strict transport

00:06:06.366-->00:06:10.403
that's something that um our
organization has animated and
put a lot of energy into

00:06:10.403-->00:06:15.609
something I personally work my
tail off on and uh that's uh
gotten me the chance to meet a

00:06:15.609-->00:06:20.347
lot of a lot of the good folks
here and uh hopefully we're
trying to hopefully we're making

00:06:20.347-->00:06:25.352
the government a better place
>>I'm Allan Friedman I'm with
the uh US Department of Commerce

00:06:29.889-->00:06:33.693
in the national
telecommunications and
information administration uh

00:06:33.693-->00:06:39.733
we're part of the administration
we are the president's advisor
on telecom and internet policy

00:06:39.733-->00:06:45.105
uh you may have heard of uh my
boss is Secretary Larry
Strickling who is trying to uh

00:06:45.105-->00:06:50.110
keep the internet free and open
with the icann iana transition
uh and thank you uh and in fact

00:06:52.445-->00:06:57.550
that's uh a large part of what
our organization does is
represent the equities of a free

00:06:57.550-->00:07:02.489
and open internet uh both inside
government discussions uh as we
sort through policy uh as a

00:07:05.158-->00:07:10.163
giant complex government uh and
also uh across the private
sector um in fact we take this

00:07:13.433-->00:07:19.973
notion of multi stakeholder
engagement quite seriously uh
too often there are policy

00:07:19.973-->00:07:25.545
issues where if we wait around
for legislation it's going to
take too long and it may not be

00:07:25.545-->00:07:30.784
great because there's going to
be lots of uh complexities and
legislation a pretty big hammer

00:07:30.784-->00:07:36.122
regulation also takes a while
and uh when Jonathan isn't
writing it himself it's not

00:07:36.122-->00:07:42.762
always optimal uh so what's the
tool we have left and our tool
is we try to get the right

00:07:42.762-->00:07:47.767
people in the room and say guys
let's solve this among ourselves
with the right engineers in the

00:07:49.969-->00:07:56.309
room from all the different
relevant stakeholders uh so that
we can demonstrate that this is

00:07:56.309-->00:08:02.015
a solution that can be solved by
coordination collaboration
rather than waiting around uh

00:08:02.015-->00:08:07.020
for you know long uh drawn out
legal processes or regulation uh
we have two ongoing initiatives

00:08:09.055-->00:08:15.028
that might be of interest to uh
you guys right now uh one is on
everyone's favorite topic

00:08:15.028-->00:08:21.334
vulnerability disclosure uh we
know that this is not a new
issue but on the other hand uh

00:08:21.334-->00:08:26.573
the cliche that everything
everyone is now a software
vendor really is true and there

00:08:26.573-->00:08:31.644
are a lot of organizations that
have never had to work with
researchers before so we're

00:08:31.644-->00:08:37.117
bringing together security
researchers vendors uh middlemen
everyone possible and saying hey

00:08:37.117-->00:08:42.789
how can we equip companies and
organizations around the country
and even around the world to

00:08:42.789-->00:08:48.695
know what to do when someone
knocks on their door and says
hey uh there's a big problem in

00:08:48.695-->00:08:54.234
your system and we can help you
solve it how do we get people
along that path the second

00:08:54.234-->00:08:59.372
initiative which we've just
announced is around everyone's
buzz word favorite uh IOT

00:08:59.372-->00:09:05.078
security uh it's sort of
universally recognized that one
everything is going to be

00:09:05.078-->00:09:11.217
connected sooner or later and
two security is a giant flaw no
one's really building it in

00:09:11.217-->00:09:16.756
right now how do we start that
process how can the government
promote a better marketplace for

00:09:16.756-->00:09:22.662
that. So we're starting with a
small bite and saying hey
patching seems like an important

00:09:22.662-->00:09:27.667
issue but there isn't really a
universal definition for what it
means to be patchable so let's

00:09:30.270-->00:09:36.910
get tech engineers people who
make products consumer
representatives security

00:09:36.910-->00:09:42.816
researchers in a room and say
what are the different
dimensions of patchability here

00:09:42.816-->00:09:47.720
are all of the the technical
details here's the user
experience here's the

00:09:47.720-->00:09:53.226
connectivity issues let's build
a taxonomy then try to collapse
that down to a small set of

00:09:53.226-->00:09:59.165
definitions there is no one size
fits all and from those
definitions have a couple of

00:09:59.165-->00:10:05.271
words that we can tell consumers
don't buy a smart widget without
this on the box voluntarily this

00:10:05.271-->00:10:09.175
isn't the government saying
don't do this this would be
consumer reports or Mudge or

00:10:09.175-->00:10:14.547
someone else saying hey look for
these words but these words are
backed by a couple of paragraphs

00:10:14.547-->00:10:20.920
of technical specifications and
by the way if you lie about
what's in your box we have some

00:10:20.920-->00:10:25.325
colleagues in government who uh
know how to take care of that so
if you're interested in talking

00:10:25.325-->00:10:29.128
about IOT security or
vulnerability disclosure we're
very happy to have you engaged

00:10:29.128-->00:10:34.334
uh and we hope you do because
when we meet it we say its multi
stakeholder whoever shows up

00:10:34.334-->00:10:38.438
gets a voice to weigh in and
make sure that everyone else can
hear what you have to say.

00:10:41.307-->00:10:46.713
>>Thanks uh so let me touch on
the FCC briefly and then uh
again open it up for questions

00:10:46.713-->00:10:51.684
from the microphones uh so the
FCC Is the federal regulatory
agency for communications

00:10:51.684-->00:10:58.291
infrastructure and services um
and that includes communication
security and privacy um so in in

00:10:58.291-->00:11:04.797
the US legal system um the FTC
is sort of the closest we have
to a catch all data regulator um

00:11:04.797-->00:11:08.668
uh but there's a lot of sector
specific regulation so for
instance our colleagues at the

00:11:08.668-->00:11:13.673
department of health and human
services deal with medical
security and privacy uh FCC does

00:11:13.673-->00:11:19.479
communication security and
privacy um and it's an
independent agency in two senses

00:11:19.479-->00:11:24.117
uh the first is we're not within
one of the cabinet departments
uh and the second is the

00:11:24.117-->00:11:29.122
commissioners are nominated by
the president and confirmed by
the senate um but they don't

00:11:29.122-->00:11:34.627
report to the president uh so if
the president wants to provide
input on a FCC preceding he

00:11:34.627-->00:11:41.167
writes a comment uh to the
agency uh just like any of you
can uh so uh so the independence

00:11:41.167-->00:11:46.172
is very real um the FCCs core
function is uh independently
proposing enacting and enforcing

00:11:48.441-->00:11:53.580
rules so it's a little bit of a
blend of the three branches of
government um we say here's what

00:11:53.580-->00:11:58.985
we think the law should be on
this issue and then put it out
for comment and uh and and any

00:11:58.985-->00:12:04.958
of you can write in and say why
we're right or wrong um then the
FCC finalizes those rules and

00:12:04.958-->00:12:09.963
then ultimately it becomes a job
for where I sit primarily the
enforcement bureau to make sure

00:12:09.963-->00:12:15.401
those rules are followed um so
the FCCs authority in
communications covers a range of

00:12:15.401-->00:12:20.406
technologies um radio and all
sorts of RF emissions um uh uh
television uh uh whether

00:12:23.009-->00:12:29.248
broadcast or cable or satellite
or fibre or whatever's next um
uh telephone of course and the

00:12:29.248-->00:12:34.854
agency's recent focus has been
especially on uh broadband
internet uh so you may have seen

00:12:34.854-->00:12:38.825
uh the term net neutrality
somewhere or other I'm just
gonna guess this crowd's heard

00:12:38.825-->00:12:43.830
that one before um so the FCC
proposed uh strong rules to
protect the uh the open internet

00:12:45.965-->00:12:51.537
um and just a month and a half
ago the uh DC circuit concluded
that uh those rules were

00:12:51.537-->00:12:57.877
consistent with federal law and
net neutrality is the law of the
land um so uh much of the net

00:12:57.877-->00:13:04.117
neutrality proceeding focused on
uh uh the kind of economics of
innovation online um but at the

00:13:04.117-->00:13:07.754
time the commission said we know
we're going to come back and
look at security and privacy do

00:13:07.754-->00:13:13.660
more rules on security and
privacy kind of left that open
for another day and so uh

00:13:13.660-->00:13:19.232
earlier this year the commission
proposed rules uh for ISP
security and privacy uh saying

00:13:19.232-->00:13:23.970
ISP should be transparent about
their practices should have
reasonable security protections

00:13:23.970-->00:13:30.843
in place for your data um and uh
and that you should usually have
choice and opt in choice if your

00:13:30.843-->00:13:36.649
ISP wants to repurpose your data
for advertising or anything else
um we've also been vigorously

00:13:36.649-->00:13:40.520
enforcing security and privacy
protections that are already in
the books so for instance

00:13:40.520-->00:13:44.757
earlier this year we settled
with Verizon for tampering with
their customers internet traffic

00:13:44.757-->00:13:49.729
to insert unique identifiers
that made them trackable online
uh there was a over a million

00:13:49.729-->00:13:55.068
dollar fine but more importantly
Verizon agreed to make the
process opt in uh for for any of

00:13:55.068-->00:13:59.639
these headers going out to to
third party businesses uh we've
also done data breach cases

00:13:59.639-->00:14:04.510
against AT&T and Cox uh and just
earlier this week you may have
seen we reached a settlement

00:14:04.510-->00:14:10.783
with TP-Link a router vendor um
over uh selling some routers
that could be modified to uh

00:14:10.783-->00:14:15.822
create radio interference but um
an important part of that
settlement was TP-Link

00:14:15.822-->00:14:20.059
committing to working with the
open source community in chips
it manufactures uh towards

00:14:20.059-->00:14:25.264
bringing linux support custom
firmware support under their
routers uh so even when we're

00:14:25.264-->00:14:28.935
kind of operating in one of our
kind of classic areas we're
trying to make sure to promote

00:14:28.935-->00:14:33.139
innovation um and make sure that
uh sort of the freedom to tinker
is protected the freedom to

00:14:33.139-->00:14:39.078
lawfully tinker my boss likes to
point out um let me close by
touching on some of the uh

00:14:39.078-->00:14:44.517
exciting work in progress we
have uh so just recently the
commission set up um uh the sort

00:14:44.517-->00:14:49.655
of licensing infrastructure for
uh upper microwave spectrum
upper microwave spectrum I knew

00:14:49.655-->00:14:54.727
nothing about before uh coming
to the agency um turns out the
technology is now there to make

00:14:54.727-->00:14:59.298
this very useful spectrum and
it's widely believed to be uh an
important component of 5g

00:14:59.298-->00:15:04.937
wireless technologies and so the
commission set out its security
expectations for for uh for the

00:15:04.937-->00:15:09.942
spectrum and and and uh plans to
address 5G more fully uh soon um
those those expectations include

00:15:13.079-->00:15:19.085
that there be uh a routing
security and for voice and voice
calls and uh text message uh

00:15:19.085-->00:15:24.557
community uh uh security from
one communications device to
another communications device um

00:15:24.557-->00:15:27.927
uh we think that's what we think
that's what the use of the
spectrum should look like and if

00:15:27.927-->00:15:31.764
you'd like to hear more about it
uh one of my colleagues uh
Admiral Simpson is going to be

00:15:31.764-->00:15:37.804
doing a uh presentation at the
internet of things workshop here
at Defcon. Um we've also done

00:15:37.804-->00:15:42.008
quite a lot of work recently to
address robo calls the chairman
sent out letters to the major

00:15:42.008-->00:15:48.581
telecom firms um saying uh he
expects immediate action AT&T is
taking up the charge uh they're

00:15:48.581-->00:15:53.286
leading the new um multi
industry working group uh to
deliver actionable results

00:15:53.286-->00:15:58.324
including uh new deployments of
call authentication standards
new efforts to make sure phone

00:15:58.324-->00:16:03.763
numbers like the IRS main line
can't be easily spoofed efforts
to build uh compatibility

00:16:03.763-->00:16:10.503
interfaces so folks can bring uh
filtering like spam button uh
technology into the phone system

00:16:10.503-->00:16:14.373
um and then I mentioned earlier
the agency's been working on
security and privacy rules for

00:16:14.373-->00:16:20.413
ISPs uh we propose those uh in
March uh the comment period
closed recently and so that that

00:16:20.413-->00:16:25.751
uh remains work in in progress.
Um so that covers what I want to
cover for the FCC and again this

00:16:25.751-->00:16:29.956
is this is your session and it's
going to be mainly Q & A and so
there's a microphone there and a

00:16:29.956-->00:16:34.961
microphone there uh and by all
means lineup and we'll take your
questions thanks. [applause]. Ok

00:16:40.867-->00:16:45.872
start over here >>Yes, I imagine
this is for the FCC, I'm
wondering what is your timeframe

00:16:51.244-->00:16:56.249
for the telecoms to harden their
system seven vulnerabilities
[laughter] >>Uh so uh we work

00:17:01.954-->00:17:06.559
closely with the telecoms to
implement better protections uh
across their networks including

00:17:06.559-->00:17:12.698
SS7 uh the commission hasn't put
out a a a firm timeline uh on
that particular issue but an

00:17:12.698-->00:17:18.271
important part of the 5G uh
communications work that the
commission's doing is saying

00:17:18.271-->00:17:23.009
here's the way we think the
world has to look going forward
um you know obviously we're not

00:17:23.009-->00:17:26.846
going to tell companies how to
build their their networks um
but we're going to set

00:17:26.846-->00:17:31.284
expectations and we're going to
work with them to make sure they
meet those expectations um and

00:17:31.284-->00:17:36.088
for now that's that's an ongoing
conversation but the commission
does have regulatory authority

00:17:36.088-->00:17:42.962
and can always be firmer if if
that becomes necessary. >>Uh
over on the right. >>Hi uh this

00:17:42.962-->00:17:49.769
question is for the FCC what are
some bits of advice you can give
to private citizens so that we

00:17:49.769-->00:17:55.207
can be impactful during the
request for comments stage
lately it's becoming an

00:17:55.207-->00:18:00.146
increasingly politicized event
with large corporations lobbying
excessively hard and we don't

00:18:02.949-->00:18:06.752
have the monetary resources to
have our voices heard and we as
technologists know that some of

00:18:06.752-->00:18:08.754
the things that they're doing
have led to stagnation of
broadband in rural areas,

00:18:08.754-->00:18:10.756
increasingly nasty uh behaviors,
like with Cox trying to do the
opt-in service for additional

00:18:10.756-->00:18:12.758
privacy and it's just it seems
that it's getting worse in some
ways, how can we have our voices

00:18:12.758-->00:18:17.763
heard? Thank you. >>So let me
start with the uh FCC component
uh of this then I'm going to

00:18:35.514-->00:18:39.585
hand it off to Allan and then
Eric to address getting your um
voices heard in the processes

00:18:39.585-->00:18:45.358
they work on. Uh so the F, FCC's
usual process for for doing a
rule making is we issue

00:18:45.358-->00:18:50.029
something called an NPRM a
notice of proposed rulemaking um
where we say here's what we

00:18:50.029-->00:18:56.235
think the laws should be on this
area, uh in this area uh and
then there is a usually about a

00:18:56.235-->00:19:01.674
thirty, forty five day, um uh
comment period then another
equally long reply comment

00:19:01.674-->00:19:06.946
period um then uh there's some
period of internal decision
making uh stakeholders can

00:19:06.946-->00:19:10.049
continue to come in and meet
with the commission, continue to
write letters to the commission

00:19:10.049-->00:19:16.188
uh and then ultimately uh the
commission proposes final rules
then usually someone sues um and

00:19:16.188-->00:19:21.193
uh uh and then finally after
judicial review um the the
matter is settled uh so that's

00:19:24.697-->00:19:31.270
uh that's the process uh as for
making sure your voices are
heard um uh well I have to be

00:19:31.270-->00:19:37.743
careful not to comment on of any
uh uh ongoing proceeding uh I
think it's fair to say that um

00:19:37.743-->00:19:42.748
I've been really heartened to
see how the process works um uh
being in the agency um smart

00:19:45.051-->00:19:50.823
comments get noticed and if you
come to the conversation with
something new to say and

00:19:50.823-->00:19:55.828
especially if you have some real
data to bring to bare um it gets
noticed uh and so uh uh sort of

00:19:58.631-->00:20:05.137
the the the the best advice I
can give on how how to uh kind
of contribute to the debate is

00:20:05.137-->00:20:10.142
make sure that um uh uh what you
write is you know not to
plicative uh uh you know ideally

00:20:14.413-->00:20:20.019
doesn't use curse words at us or
something [laughter] um uh and
and gives us some real really

00:20:20.019-->00:20:26.926
constructive advice uh uh they
get sent those comments get
singled out um let me also add

00:20:26.926-->00:20:30.296
just as a purely procedural
matter make sure you're
commenting on the right

00:20:30.296-->00:20:36.769
proceeding uh every so often
folks will file comments in the
wrong place um and I and uh the

00:20:36.769-->00:20:40.840
system at FCC has recently
gotten a lot better for filing
comments we have a whole new

00:20:40.840-->00:20:47.780
online comment filing system um
uh but make sure you file in in
in the right right docket um and

00:20:47.780-->00:20:51.517
make sure that the issue you're
writing in about is is
appropriate for that docket so

00:20:51.517-->00:20:56.655
sometimes folks will have really
smart things to say and really
great data but it's just not

00:20:56.655-->00:21:01.827
germane to the specific issue in
front of the agency um by all
means call that to our attention

00:21:01.827-->00:21:07.099
feel free to uh um uh kind of
reach out to who who you think
is the appropriate contact at

00:21:07.099-->00:21:12.138
the agency um but uh it's easy
for it to get buried in a docket
if it's not germane because

00:21:12.138-->00:21:15.841
someone will review the comment
and say it just doesn't bear on
this particular proceeding so

00:21:15.841-->00:21:21.914
that's a kind of a procedural
note. Okay so now over to Allan
and then Eric. >>So >>So as an

00:21:21.914-->00:21:28.020
example of a comment process
that uh impressed me how
effective it was, uh a few

00:21:28.020-->00:21:32.158
months after I joined the
department of commerce last
year, I get a call from one of

00:21:32.158-->00:21:38.597
my colleagues uh in a different
part of commerce called the
bureau of industry and security.

00:21:38.597-->00:21:45.070
He says hey we're about to
release a proposed rule based on
this arms control agreement

00:21:45.070-->00:21:50.075
known as Wassenaar. So we had
some discussions and we helped
prepare them for the fact that

00:21:53.646-->00:21:58.651
they were going to get some
strong responses and we did get
a lot of responses and many of

00:22:01.253-->00:22:07.193
those were really helpful um
this was a case where industry
and the security industry were

00:22:07.193-->00:22:11.197
on the same side uh but they
brought two very different
perspectives that was very

00:22:11.197-->00:22:16.202
helpful um it's challenging
because often people were
commenting based on news stories

00:22:19.205-->00:22:24.944
that were based on other news
stories and so by the time they
filed their comments it wasn't

00:22:24.944-->00:22:29.114
something that was directly
related to the regulation
because a lot of the stuff is

00:22:29.114-->00:22:34.119
quite technical so as Jonathan
said you know make sure have as
much preparation as you can. Uh

00:22:36.689-->00:22:43.429
but this is an area where we got
the comments and uh they were
overwhelmingly negative uh I

00:22:43.429-->00:22:49.868
think there was one comment in
favor uh out of over two hundred
and so the US Department of

00:22:49.868-->00:22:54.807
Commerce worked with our
government colleagues and has
gone back uh to Wassenaar to try

00:22:54.807-->00:23:00.613
to renegotiate and so that I
think is an example of feedback
from the security community

00:23:00.613-->00:23:05.618
driving policy in the direction
that it should um and so as you
are preparing to engage uh it

00:23:08.754-->00:23:13.859
helps to talk to other people uh
if you have colleagues or
friends who are engaged in the

00:23:13.859-->00:23:19.131
policy network uh they'll be
able to give you a little bit of
background. If you're curious at

00:23:19.131-->00:23:24.203
least in our case I don't know
if the FCC can do it but in
commerce we'll talk to you about

00:23:24.203-->00:23:30.009
what we're looking for so that
you can tailor your feedback uh
to to give us the insight that

00:23:30.009-->00:23:34.046
we need to make good decisions.
Uh there are lots of
organizations out there that are

00:23:34.046-->00:23:40.653
engaged in a lot of these issues
whether it's EFF or I Am the
Cavalry uh we need more

00:23:40.653-->00:23:46.992
advocates for security uh as as
a unique value so please try to
engage and learn as much as you

00:23:46.992-->00:23:52.498
can and then give us as many
feedba- as much feedback as
possible. >>So uh I'll just

00:23:52.498-->00:23:56.335
briefly add on it's actually a
bit of an outside perspective so
I'm not in a regulatory agency

00:23:56.335-->00:24:01.707
now at GSA um before this I was
at an NGO a non nonprofit called
the Sunlight foundation that did

00:24:01.707-->00:24:05.277
open govern- does open
government and transparency work
for about five years and I

00:24:05.277-->00:24:11.016
worked a lot on uh trying to
make the regulatory process more
accessible to people because I

00:24:11.016-->00:24:16.021
watched many different times uh
people leave the opportunity on
the table to come and comment on

00:24:18.957-->00:24:24.330
a regulation and I'll tell you
that like the people who will
always comment on a regulation

00:24:24.330-->00:24:30.035
that affects them are like
affected business or the private
sector not very often comparably

00:24:30.035-->00:24:36.308
do you get like real public
constructive input on things and
it's it's not always well known

00:24:36.308-->00:24:39.545
that like and this is
distinguishing from a lot of
other countries in the world

00:24:39.545-->00:24:44.316
that in the US executive
agencies that are that are
issuing regulations must respond

00:24:44.316-->00:24:49.088
to every unique comment they
get. They have to at least
acknowledge it in some way and

00:24:49.088-->00:24:52.958
I've read many final regulations
that address, that went down and
addressed all the different

00:24:52.958-->00:24:58.630
groups and notable comments that
they got and you know changed
their minds on small and large

00:24:58.630-->00:25:03.902
things as they went. You don't
always get your way but when you
participate you showing up

00:25:03.902-->00:25:08.507
really does matter and that was
my personal ex- experience as an
advocate and like open

00:25:08.507-->00:25:14.880
government um lobbyist sometimes
uh working on these issues that
showing up is is everything so I

00:25:14.880-->00:25:18.650
really do encourage you to you
don't literally I mean the
federal register if you go to

00:25:18.650-->00:25:22.388
federal register dot gov they've
actually added in the last few
years uh a number of really

00:25:22.388-->00:25:27.626
great alerting and feeds systems
for you to follow things more
easily. It's actually a really

00:25:27.626-->00:25:32.898
great team that uh built federal
register dot gov uh they were
invited by OFR to do it after

00:25:32.898-->00:25:38.537
they did an app contest uh as an
outside group of developers
trying to reimagine what federal

00:25:38.537-->00:25:43.709
regulation and commenting should
look like and that is uh so I
and there are other servers that

00:25:43.709-->00:25:48.480
will help you do that and I just
strongly encourage you to take
that seriously. >>I I'll just

00:25:48.480-->00:25:53.485
add that at the FTC um we we
often are looking for public
input uh usually when we

00:25:55.487-->00:26:00.993
announce that we're having a
workshop there are opportunities
to comment both before and

00:26:00.993-->00:26:06.398
potentially get on the agenda as
well as after the workshop and
we are very much interested in

00:26:06.398-->00:26:13.205
people who bring us data um you
know we we want data we want we
want empirical results and not

00:26:13.205-->00:26:17.976
not just um you know the the
opinions which which are nice
too but but if you are a

00:26:17.976-->00:26:21.880
researcher who can bring us data
that's something that we are
going to be very interested in

00:26:21.880-->00:26:26.885
seeing. >>let me amplify that
point before moving on to the
next question um we hear a lot

00:26:29.254-->00:26:35.794
from lawyers in the government
we don't hear so much from
technical experts um and so uh

00:26:35.794-->00:26:40.799
those that sort of input is
incredibly valuable and it gets
noticed. >>Hi, so you mentioned

00:26:43.435-->00:26:48.740
that the DOD now has a bug
bounty but for sort of an
opposite perspective uh one of

00:26:48.740-->00:26:53.078
the things that I do is run
Census dot io and other scanning
for security things and five

00:26:53.078-->00:26:57.049
years ago when we started the
DOD sent us a very strongly
worded email saying you'd better

00:26:57.049-->00:27:01.253
stop scanning us so that means
we can't participate them with
them we can't tell them about

00:27:01.253-->00:27:05.858
vulnerable TLS implementations
so how do you engage with the
DOD beyond just submitting to

00:27:05.858-->00:27:11.396
their bug bounty? >>That's a
difficult question given that
none of us are from the DOD uh

00:27:11.396-->00:27:16.201
so we're probably not going to
be able to give you the answer
that you're looking for um but

00:27:16.201-->00:27:22.074
you know in general uh the
closer you get to communicating
with subject matter experts uh

00:27:22.074-->00:27:28.146
inside different agencies uh the
more you get answers that make
sense and uh and creative

00:27:28.146-->00:27:34.620
solutions to different problems
um the the defense the DOD hack
the pentagon program was started

00:27:34.620-->00:27:39.057
by the Department of Defense
digital service which is a
relatively new team inside DOD

00:27:39.057-->00:27:43.395
it's part of the US Digital
Service uh which is a white
house initiative um that is

00:27:43.395-->00:27:49.301
creating digital service teams
in a few different agencies and
uh but that's about the best I'm

00:27:49.301-->00:27:53.805
going to I or maybe anybody here
is going to be able to give an
answer to that. >>I think just

00:27:53.805-->00:27:58.810
uh large organizations are not
monolithic uh and so the as as
as we said you know the closer

00:28:03.649-->00:28:06.151
you can get to the people who
engage the better uh in the
private sector uh you know they

00:28:06.151-->00:28:08.153
we work with large companies
inside our process on
vulnerability disclosure who are

00:28:08.153-->00:28:10.155
trying to figure out how can we
work with researchers even as
you know their general council's

00:28:10.155-->00:28:12.157
office is writing comments about
how we need to bring back uh
DMCA controls on on their

00:28:12.157-->00:28:17.162
products so uh the trick is to
find the allies in any
organization that you can um I

00:28:32.644-->00:28:39.551
think this panel probably is a
great way to start to find the
right people uh and um so good

00:28:39.551-->00:28:43.188
luck and thank you for reaching
out >>Thank you >>And thank you
also for fur running Census dot

00:28:43.188-->00:28:48.193
IO so I I GSA 18F uses that data
in in our work all the time um I
I you know I personally use it

00:28:50.629-->00:28:55.701
in my work to understand the
government surface area and to
report things to other agencies

00:28:55.701-->00:28:59.338
as necessary and to tell people
when they're falling down on
something and then to work with

00:28:59.338-->00:29:04.276
them to fix it so really like
big thank you big thankyou to
you for that [applause] >>Uh so

00:29:09.781-->00:29:14.219
I'm a student who is going into
my uh senior year at highschool
and I was just wondering how did

00:29:14.219-->00:29:18.390
you guys get into the federal
government and how could a
prospective student also get in?

00:29:18.390-->00:29:23.395
Thank you. >>Go down the line?
>>Uh that's so one I I I think
there I'm going to speak for

00:29:28.400-->00:29:34.039
everyone and say we desperately
need smart, passionate,
technically aware people in

00:29:34.039-->00:29:39.044
government uh desperately and
you know the advice I would give
is if it's fairly easy right now

00:29:43.181-->00:29:48.754
to go from the technical world
into a policy track uh my
background is in computer

00:29:48.754-->00:29:54.626
science, wasn't very good at it
so I have my PHD in policy uh
and when you're me- uh so pol

00:29:54.626-->00:29:59.097
that means I'm a mediocre
economist and a mediocre coder
and when you're mediocre at that

00:29:59.097-->00:30:04.102
many things you end up in
Washington [laughter] uh and and
uh you know you know I was an

00:30:06.571-->00:30:11.810
academic and then someone talked
me in but I think the advice I
would give is stay on the

00:30:11.810-->00:30:16.982
technical side as much as
possible but engage in policy in
your spare time and eventually

00:30:16.982-->00:30:21.453
you'll find an issue where you
can find the right person and
weigh in and they'll say we need

00:30:21.453-->00:30:27.826
you on our team. >>Yeah I I mean
so as somebody who went um
primarily my background is in

00:30:27.826-->00:30:32.864
software engineering uh I have a
CS degree but I work a ton on
policy day to day now and uh

00:30:32.864-->00:30:37.836
it's really as simple as
becoming an expert in something
and being willing to talk about

00:30:37.836-->00:30:43.041
it publically, privately,
leadership without fear and have
confidence in what you say and

00:30:43.041-->00:30:49.481
really develop your skills as a
communicator, right, so like
being a good writer is just a

00:30:49.481-->00:30:54.319
universal skill that will make
you more effective at bringing
people uh into your way of

00:30:54.319-->00:30:59.291
thinking um co- uh projecting
that you know what you're
talking about and that's

00:30:59.291-->00:31:04.930
something that you know even,
even if it's not going to be for
for you know even if you don't

00:31:04.930-->00:31:08.767
end up working on policy for
some amount of years take take
the time to keep exercising

00:31:08.767-->00:31:12.971
those muscles, to to keep
writing and to keep getting
feedback on that and to keep

00:31:12.971-->00:31:17.976
becoming a good communicator.
>>Yeah so um I started my career
uh working in AT&T and um was

00:31:21.313-->00:31:26.318
doing research on uh privacy
mostly and I actually um
presented research to the FTC

00:31:29.421-->00:31:34.426
twenty years ago I went to their
workshops and when um FTC staff
said can can someone explain

00:31:36.895-->00:31:43.335
again how third party cookies
work I would you know take time
from my day to call them back

00:31:43.335-->00:31:48.573
and to explain it yet again
right and and basically became
known to them as someone who was

00:31:48.573-->00:31:54.179
willing to explain these
technical concepts in in plain
language uh I then became a

00:31:54.179-->00:31:59.184
professor at Carnegie Mellon and
have um uh steered my students
in their research to trying to

00:32:01.520-->00:32:06.525
make our research relevant to
some of the policy needs um and
submitting um our our results to

00:32:08.627-->00:32:14.399
government agencies and so right
now I'm actually on leave from
Carnegie Mellon and uh the chief

00:32:14.399-->00:32:21.006
technologist position at the FTC
tends to be an academic who
comes in for for a year or two

00:32:21.006-->00:32:26.411
um the other point I want to
make uh for our our high school
student friend is that um if if

00:32:26.411-->00:32:31.416
you know that you're interested
in government service there are
scholarship opportunities for

00:32:31.416-->00:32:37.989
you um so scholarship for
service if you basically if you
are a US citizen and um and have

00:32:37.989-->00:32:43.862
technical interest uh you can
get the government to basically
pay your tuition um in exchange

00:32:43.862-->00:32:48.667
for you then committing to do
some work for the government and
so it's a great opportunity.

00:32:48.667-->00:32:54.873
>>Uh to amplify something Lorrie
said um it's about explaining
things to other people I mean

00:32:54.873-->00:32:59.511
the the community that we're all
apart of here that you know this
conference is tremendously huge

00:32:59.511-->00:33:03.849
even just this room is is filled
with people this is a large
amazing community and you could

00:33:03.849-->00:33:09.187
spend years your you could spend
your entire career committing to
and within this community and go

00:33:09.187-->00:33:14.025
very far but there are certain
kinds of of things and certain
kinds of impacts that require

00:33:14.025-->00:33:19.898
you to speak outside this
community and to ma- make your
work accessible and approachable

00:33:19.898-->00:33:24.769
to a larger set of people
because even a lot of people who
aren't professional information

00:33:24.769-->00:33:29.908
security folks, professional
privacy folks have an interest
in that, aren't dumb, like can

00:33:29.908-->00:33:34.212
can, like and are intellectually
curious and are willing to apply
and integrate that stuff into

00:33:34.212-->00:33:39.351
their work so it's so something
to remember too that even though
uh it you know you may not ever

00:33:39.351-->00:33:42.821
have to you may never be
confronted in in your life with
a time when you have to

00:33:42.821-->00:33:47.893
communicate to the broader uh
community like it's the there
are certain kinds of work where

00:33:47.893-->00:33:53.632
you really should do that. >>So
um I'm also uh a loaner from
academia uh I'm on loan to the

00:33:53.632-->00:33:58.637
FCC from Stanford um >>Go bears!
[laughter] >>that was inevitable
[laughter] you know we we can't

00:34:03.008-->00:34:08.013
all go to school at a country
club. So uh so uh I uh I'm I'm
in a different stage in my

00:34:12.317-->00:34:17.355
career from Lorrie of course um
I hope to be faculty in the not
too distant future but I'm I'm

00:34:17.355-->00:34:23.695
uh I'm just rotating out from
grad school and so I want to
note there are opportunities

00:34:23.695-->00:34:27.832
absolutely at that stage of your
your career coming out of
academia if you don't know what

00:34:27.832-->00:34:32.771
you want to do next you want to
take a little gap between from
between what you're doing uh in

00:34:32.771-->00:34:37.075
academia and whatever comes next
um the government has great
roles there um there are a bunch

00:34:37.075-->00:34:41.680
of great opportunities straight
of college, straight out of grad
school um uh there there are

00:34:41.680-->00:34:47.252
programs to support that um uh
more programs are coming online
all the time uh there are also

00:34:47.252-->00:34:52.457
wonderful internship and
fellowship opportunities to
explore um even even with uh you

00:34:52.457-->00:34:57.395
know six month or one year stint
in government you you can have a
tremendous amount of impact um

00:34:57.395-->00:35:02.934
so >>Or a summer internship
which we we actually have uh
three summer interns at the FTC

00:35:02.934-->00:35:09.307
in technology roles this summer
>>Um and I I really want to em-
emphasize Eric's point about

00:35:09.307-->00:35:15.313
communicating with folks in
government uh I think uh kind of
having worked on both sides and

00:35:15.313-->00:35:22.020
I guess I should come clean, I'm
also a lawyer um the the way in
which folks communicate in the

00:35:22.020-->00:35:28.693
hacker community is very
different from the way folks
communicate in government um and

00:35:28.693-->00:35:33.898
uh I don't for better or for
worse but uh learning how to
sort of speak 'Washingtonese' is

00:35:33.898-->00:35:37.802
really really important um
that's something you can learn
in advance of coming to the

00:35:37.802-->00:35:40.872
government and it's a great
skill set you can pick up if you
spend some time inside the

00:35:40.872-->00:35:46.011
government. Yeah, over on the
left >>Great thanks, uh Dan
Tinen for the Guardian uh I have

00:35:46.011-->00:35:50.548
a question for all the panel
members uh and it's kind of a
general one. There's been a lot

00:35:50.548-->00:35:55.220
of speculation lately given the
hacks for the DNC and Hillary
Clinton's campaign that the

00:35:55.220-->00:35:59.724
actual election could be hacked
in particular by a certain
nation state whose name begins

00:35:59.724-->00:36:06.097
with R so I'm going to ask you
to rate on a scale of one to
ten, one being not a big deal,

00:36:06.097-->00:36:11.102
ten being holy shit, how worried
you are about this happening and
if so what worries you most?

00:36:19.277-->00:36:24.983
[laughter] >>So remember when I
was talking about uh learning
how to speak Washingtonese just

00:36:24.983-->00:36:29.988
before? Yeah um no comment?
[laughter] >>Yeah it's yeah it's
I mean I don't think it's not

00:36:35.660-->00:36:41.199
really any of our my certainly
not my area of expertise here
>>So I'm going to I'm going to

00:36:41.199-->00:36:46.871
use this as a pivot which is the
other aspect of engagement
policy is to know when to say

00:36:46.871-->00:36:51.876
that's a great question but I
don't know let's bring in actual
experts uh and fortunately uh

00:36:56.214-->00:37:02.854
since 2000 uh there's been a lot
of great research on security of
electronic voting machines, uh

00:37:02.854-->00:37:08.960
and I don't know where some of
obvious people here uh right
there couple of great professors

00:37:08.960-->00:37:13.364
out there uh the other lesson I
would take away that's highly
policy relevant is if you really

00:37:13.364-->00:37:18.369
are interested in this um go and
volunteer for your local
elections board uh you will be

00:37:21.106-->00:37:26.111
the only person there under
seventy uh the seventy year olds
are wonderful uh and it is a

00:37:29.347-->00:37:34.352
great way to learn how complex
the technology and the
bureaucracy and the ideal high

00:37:36.387-->00:37:42.060
level goals of democracy all
work together. So if you are
interested in understanding the

00:37:42.060-->00:37:46.798
security of the election system
get some on the ground
experience while you're hacking

00:37:46.798-->00:37:52.337
your election uh device as well.
>>Yeah I I I have been an
election judge in Pittsburgh for

00:37:52.337-->00:37:57.075
the past ten years and it it's a
really interesting and eye
opening experience I I

00:37:57.075-->00:38:03.715
definitely recommend that
>>First off thank ya'll for
coming here today um I can't

00:38:03.715-->00:38:07.785
imagine it's exciting to be told
you're going to be at Defcon as
representing the feds but thank

00:38:07.785-->00:38:13.258
you for coming, appreciate that.
And um that being said I had two
questions mainly for the FTC

00:38:13.258-->00:38:17.262
where do you see the breach
indus- breach insurance industry
going and do you see that's

00:38:17.262-->00:38:22.033
going to drive private sector
upping their cyber security game
because we know legislation

00:38:22.033-->00:38:26.504
ain't gonna do it and is that a
growing stagnating industry? So
that was my first question,

00:38:26.504-->00:38:31.075
second question is, you said a
minute ago uh you want smart and
passionate people but the

00:38:31.075-->00:38:37.515
government culture tends to
bring out a least performance
necessary attitude. Is there

00:38:37.515-->00:38:42.987
anything being done at the
executive level to change that
kind of culture? >>Um yeah so on

00:38:42.987-->00:38:47.992
breach insurance um yeah I I
once again I'm going to say that
I'm not an expert in breach

00:38:50.028-->00:38:55.033
insurance and I'm I'm not really
sure um on on the issue of of
getting uh smart people to want

00:38:57.168-->00:39:03.107
to come to government um I I
think that uh that the
administration has made a number

00:39:03.107-->00:39:07.245
of pronouncements about wanting
to do this saying that like you
can wear t-shirts and jeans to

00:39:07.245-->00:39:12.016
work um you know it's a good
start but that's not enough for
you know just just along the

00:39:12.016-->00:39:18.923
lines um uh I I think that you
know within our agency uh we're
an agency that's mostly

00:39:18.923-->00:39:25.029
attorneys and um it's set up for
to work the way attorneys work
and as we're hiring more

00:39:25.029-->00:39:30.568
technical people we're saying
wait we may need to do things a
little bit differently for our

00:39:30.568-->00:39:34.439
technical folks so that this
becomes the kind of place that
they want to work and where they

00:39:34.439-->00:39:39.577
can thrive and I think the
leadership is very much open to
that. >>I want to add something

00:39:39.577-->00:39:45.583
on the culture change so 18F is
a new office we're about two
years old in the GSA and one of

00:39:45.583-->00:39:49.921
our missions there and in the
rest of the government is to
work on that cultural problem to

00:39:49.921-->00:39:55.760
attract people to government and
also to make it a great place to
work uh for people I'm actually

00:39:55.760-->00:40:01.332
I really enjoy my job at GSA
it's actually the nicest most
humane place I've ever worked uh

00:40:01.332-->00:40:06.404
in terms of remote work in terms
of you know having uh being in
the cloud for email on docs and

00:40:06.404-->00:40:11.509
calendar for having really nice
people to work around me to have
computers to deploy things to

00:40:11.509-->00:40:15.747
etcetera and that is that's a
that's a really valuable thing
there's something that's really

00:40:15.747-->00:40:20.485
dangerous though that I know we
have encountered and I have
encountered is that it's very

00:40:20.485-->00:40:26.724
tempting to talk about um
culture change as people change
and to talk about problems that

00:40:26.724-->00:40:31.362
you perceive in the government
as problems with the people but
that's it's really not the case

00:40:31.362-->00:40:35.733
and the government turns out to
be filled with a lot of really
smart well meaning people in

00:40:35.733-->00:40:41.339
some really terrible incentive
structures with a lot of fear uh
that drives executive level

00:40:41.339-->00:40:45.276
decisions like fear of being
criticized fear of being
punished fear of being hauled in

00:40:45.276-->00:40:51.115
front of whoever and uh that is
it's it's that thing that you
have to attack through

00:40:51.115-->00:40:55.386
transparency through a little
bit of courage through changing
incentive structures as

00:40:55.386-->00:40:59.857
necessary to re to
reinterpreting or rewriring
rules around hiring all those

00:40:59.857-->00:41:03.695
things and and yes those things
are all being worked on at the
executive level and at the

00:41:03.695-->00:41:08.800
ranking file level in different
ways it is just a big problem
the US government is the largest

00:41:08.800-->00:41:13.738
organization in the history of
mankind um and it's very
decentralized but it is being

00:41:13.738-->00:41:18.676
worked on all over. >>The only
thing I would add to this as
someone who is quite new to

00:41:18.676-->00:41:23.681
government is some advice that
was given to me uh when I was
first approached uh is your

00:41:26.484-->00:41:32.991
first boss is really helpful and
I'm lucky and I think many of us
are lucky to have fantastic

00:41:32.991-->00:41:39.697
supervisors who recognize that
doing meet the feds and stuff
like that is really important to

00:41:39.697-->00:41:45.136
the missions of the policy that
we're trying to change and so if
you're contemplating joining

00:41:45.136-->00:41:51.009
government uh think a lot about
uh your supervisor and and what
that relationship is going to

00:41:51.009-->00:41:56.013
look like because a great
supervisor just makes your job a
lot more fun. >>Hey um my

00:41:59.450-->00:42:04.155
question is a what kind of
metrics or data points do you
guys capture to make sure that

00:42:04.155-->00:42:10.361
your organization is safe or
secure or on the right track?
>>Sorry uh can you repeat the

00:42:10.361-->00:42:15.299
question, or Jonathan maybe?
>>Yeah so what kind of metrics
or data points do you guys

00:42:15.299-->00:42:20.304
capture to make sure that your
organization is safe or that you
guys are on the right track?

00:42:27.612-->00:42:33.451
>>Yeah sure so I mean it sort of
varies alright so um in terms of
monitoring your own systems uh

00:42:33.451-->00:42:36.220
people use all sorts of
different scanning tools, uh
people use all sorts of

00:42:36.220-->00:42:42.060
different metrics about uh the
kind of costs that are incurred
on those systems uh I know that

00:42:42.060-->00:42:47.265
so one of the things I work on
is measuring encryption presence
and quality uh around the

00:42:47.265-->00:42:52.470
government and around 18F's and
GSA's systems especially um and
you know using all of the same

00:42:52.470-->00:42:56.140
tools that you all probably use
things through Pasted Lip Curl
things that are based in in

00:42:56.140-->00:43:01.078
SSLI's uh we use data from IPV
from ZMap scans of the internet
um you know we're we're running

00:43:03.181-->00:43:08.186
in UNIX based environments and
so you know we we use the same
tools that you all do um and and

00:43:11.489-->00:43:17.462
uh use that to improve our work.
>>So I believe we're getting the
signal from the goons that it's

00:43:17.462-->00:43:23.134
time to wrap up uh so thank you
all for your questions um we're
going to stick around for a few

00:43:23.134-->00:43:28.239
minutes to uh allow additional
questions outside if you're not
inside >>Please go out that exit

00:43:28.239-->00:43:33.244
door on that side of the room
>>Thanks again [applause]
