00:00:00.033-->00:00:05.806
>> So Jake is going to talk
about attribution, um, which I
can only presume is going to be

00:00:05.806-->00:00:11.879
exclusively about either Russia
or China.[laughter] So let's
give Jake a big round of

00:00:11.879-->00:00:16.884
applause. [applause] >> Thank
you everyone. Great to see
everyone here. I seriously don't

00:00:21.121-->00:00:26.193
see enough beverages in people's
hands though, so. Maybe you
should fix that. But my name's

00:00:26.193-->00:00:30.697
Jake, I'm a CISO with Risk Based
Security. Been doing a bunch of
vulnerability and data reach

00:00:30.697-->00:00:35.168
intelligence stuff for quite
some time. I want to also
recognize Lee Johnstone for all

00:00:35.168-->00:00:39.940
the work and creation of data
and everything. So the talk here
is, uh, today, it's "'Cyber' Who

00:00:39.940-->00:00:46.346
Done It?! Attribution Analysis
Through Arrest History." So we
really are going to play a cyber

00:00:46.346-->00:00:50.484
drinking game. You guys are just
going to have to get over it,
because we're going to say cyber

00:00:50.484-->00:00:57.357
a ton through this talk. So, um,
anytime you in the slides that
it says cyber or you hear me say

00:00:57.357-->00:01:03.997
cyber. You should drink. I only
see a few beverages over here,
so we'll see. Um, and I don't

00:01:03.997-->00:01:08.936
care if it's beer or Root Beer,
so, no pressure. Alright, so if
you look back over the last five

00:01:08.936-->00:01:13.540
years. Data breaches keep
occurring at alarming rates.
Right, it's, it's just

00:01:13.540-->00:01:18.845
ridiculous, uh the amount and it
just shows that it's not getting
better and so it doesn't matter

00:01:18.845-->00:01:23.150
how many blinky lights, boxes,
we buy from security vendors,
we're still just seeing a

00:01:23.150-->00:01:27.621
ridiculous amount of breaches.
In fact, 2015 was the most
amount of breaches that we've

00:01:27.621-->00:01:33.560
ever, ever tracked. When you
look at it from, how are these
things occurring, there's that

00:01:33.560-->00:01:39.333
old 1970s thought process, I
think from the FBI that says,
the insider, right? But when you

00:01:39.333-->00:01:43.470
look at the data from 2015, it
shows that 77 percent of them
are actually coming from the

00:01:43.470-->00:01:49.242
outside. Right? Now, the insider
may hurt you the worst, but it
shows in terms of likelihood the

00:01:49.242-->00:01:53.146
outside where it's occurring and
then when you break it down by
the breach types, it's just

00:01:53.146-->00:01:57.150
hackings through the roof,
right? So we're just seeing a
ton of hacking and it's been

00:01:57.150-->00:02:01.321
that way the last couple of
years. When you look at it from
where it's happening, what

00:02:01.321-->00:02:06.293
countries, where these
organizations are being
impacted, this isn't just a USA

00:02:06.293-->00:02:12.499
issue, right? Now while the USA
and the, um, and the UK are
accounted for 46 plus percent of

00:02:12.499-->00:02:18.338
the breaches, it's not just
there, right? So it is a world
issue. And year to date, we

00:02:18.338-->00:02:23.010
still suck, right? We're not
getting any better. Uh, over
2000 data breaches confirmed

00:02:23.010-->00:02:28.048
already and it's the most amount
of records that we've ever lost
in a single year. We're already

00:02:28.048-->00:02:32.619
over at 1 point 1 billion
records being lost and we still
have a couple months to go. So,

00:02:32.619-->00:02:37.557
um, not seeing much improvement
at this point. The question we
get all the time when we're

00:02:37.557-->00:02:41.795
tracking these data breaches is,
who's behind all this stuff?
Right? Who is behind and causing

00:02:41.795-->00:02:45.332
all of these data breaches? It
comes up all the time.
Specifically the hacking events.

00:02:45.332-->00:02:51.104
Who is behind it? So this leads
us to this whole concept of
attribution, right? And if you

00:02:51.104-->00:02:54.875
try to get your head wrapped
around attribution and what does
it really mean, you can start

00:02:54.875-->00:02:59.379
looking on good old Wikipedia,
right? And that gives us a few
different ideas about what

00:02:59.379-->00:03:03.583
attribution is and other
disciplines, so in social
psychology attribution is a

00:03:03.583-->00:03:08.822
process of explaining cause and
behavior events. In copyright
law it's about crediting the

00:03:08.822-->00:03:13.994
work. In journalism it's about
attribution to a source, right?
So you start to get familiar

00:03:13.994-->00:03:20.000
there. Now in the cyber world,
we basically just want to know,
who did this, right? We want to

00:03:20.000-->00:03:25.005
know, what the hell did you just
do? What actually happened? What
was done? And then finally, why?

00:03:27.541-->00:03:31.878
Why did you do this, what are
the motives, can I have some
reasons? Right? So if you think

00:03:31.878-->00:03:35.816
about it, you always hear this
saying, you know knowledge is
power, but in these days and

00:03:35.816-->00:03:40.454
times, it's really starting to
be attribution is power, right?
And this seems to be the case,

00:03:40.454-->00:03:47.260
we want to know what's going on,
who's behind all this stuff. So,
nothing brought this attribution

00:03:47.260-->00:03:54.167
debate and problem, um, more
clear than the Sony breach in
December 2014. Right? So we

00:03:54.167-->00:03:59.239
should all remember this whole,
GOP, Guardians of the Peace,
post credit, taking credit for

00:03:59.239-->00:04:03.577
this breach. Um, and there was
serious debate over this breach.
What was the motives, who did

00:04:03.577-->00:04:08.348
it? And it was so ridiculously
bad about the back and forth
lead to just a ridiculous amount

00:04:08.348-->00:04:13.320
of lulls from the security
community, right? So we actually
created these cyberwar

00:04:13.320-->00:04:17.924
attribution bingo cards. It
still exists, if you want them,
you can go out to the website

00:04:17.924-->00:04:22.262
and generate your own cards and
play along, right and see what
happens. But if you're not up

00:04:22.262-->00:04:27.300
for games, then then there was a
couple of guys who created the
Sony Hack Attribution Generator.

00:04:27.300-->00:04:30.904
So that you can go to the
website and then sort of refresh
to get what you want. So you go

00:04:30.904-->00:04:35.542
to this first one and get the
nice report here about a Sony
Manager behind it. I don't like

00:04:35.542-->00:04:40.080
that one. Uh, Romania
organization. Hmm, that's
better. Welp, now we have North

00:04:40.080-->00:04:44.117
Korea. Right, here's a nice
detailed report. You can just
keep refreshing, right, so you

00:04:44.117-->00:04:48.255
guys can get reports. They
weren't the only one, we
actually had another website

00:04:48.255-->00:04:52.726
created called, who hacked us
dot com. You can get attribution
reports here. Here we get China,

00:04:52.726-->00:04:59.332
right? Crouching Panda, Hidden
Dragon, so here's your China
reference starting. But if you

00:04:59.332-->00:05:04.037
don't want a detailed report and
that's just too much, guess
what? We had the industry create

00:05:04.037-->00:05:09.876
cyber attribution dice. So you
can just roll the dice and get
the answer, right? And why would

00:05:09.876-->00:05:13.914
you pay for high price forensics
when you can just roll the dice?
Right? That's probably the best

00:05:13.914-->00:05:19.019
attribution you're going to get
anyway. Some people weren't so
thrilled about the cyber dice

00:05:19.019-->00:05:23.790
and they said, you know what we
need? We need a magic eight
ball. And guess what? Twitter

00:05:23.790-->00:05:28.395
answered. We have the
attribution eight ball. Right?
And unfortunately it hasn't been

00:05:28.395-->00:05:32.032
active here recently, so
whoever's behind this account,
I'd appreciate if you could step

00:05:32.032-->00:05:37.337
up your game and start tweeting
out some stuff again for us.
But, Twitter's not just enough,

00:05:37.337-->00:05:42.175
so we have duo that comes up,
right and they create the actual
attribution eight ball. And of

00:05:42.175-->00:05:47.380
course it's China. And you gotta
love the pictures behind there,
right? It was China and who's

00:05:47.380-->00:05:53.086
showing, right? so We see that,
then we see good old swift own
security when we talking about

00:05:53.086-->00:05:57.791
the MySpace breach, and should
we blame Russia or what's going
on. Saying hey, we need another

00:05:57.791-->00:06:03.964
magic eight ball. And at this
point in time, because we know
the attribution eight ball is so

00:06:03.964-->00:06:09.236
important, Threatbutt comes to
the rescue and so no offense to
Duo, but Threatbutt creates an

00:06:09.236-->00:06:13.807
attribution eight ball and if
you don't know about Threatbutt,
you should, because, uh, they

00:06:13.807-->00:06:18.912
basically provide the maximum
protection from threatening
threaty threats, like China. So

00:06:18.912-->00:06:22.382
we're really pleased, that they,
uh, were able to help us out
here. So thanks to Threatbutt

00:06:22.382-->00:06:29.055
for all your hard work. So with
all the lulls aside, I mean it's
a serious issue and people joke

00:06:29.055-->00:06:33.193
about stuff like this, because
there's something behind it,
right? And the jokes are funny,

00:06:33.193-->00:06:38.298
but let's get back to the Sony
breach and walk through it. And
the point was who did this

00:06:38.298-->00:06:43.803
thing? Right, everyone wanted to
know. And for the purposes of
this talk, there was basically

00:06:43.803-->00:06:49.943
two major viewpoints. One was,
North Korea and the other one
was an insider, also known as

00:06:49.943-->00:06:54.948
not North Korea. Right? And so,
on the North Korea side, we
predominantly had Crowd Strike

00:06:58.118-->00:07:03.056
and the FBI and on the insider,
also known as, not North Korea,
we had Norse, Mark Rogers and

00:07:05.592-->00:07:11.665
Kim Zetter from Wired coming out
with information. So here's from
Norse, right, so Norse basically

00:07:11.665-->00:07:16.403
was not involved in the case
itself, but they said they were
doing their own investigation

00:07:16.403-->00:07:20.473
and they said that the Norse
data was pointing toward a woman
that called herself Lena, and

00:07:20.473-->00:07:25.145
claimed to be connected with
this, the GOP Hacking Group.
Norse believed that they

00:07:25.145-->00:07:30.116
identified the women who had
worked at Sony in Los Angeles
for about ten years and then was

00:07:30.116-->00:07:35.088
involved with it. And so what
comes from them is, we are very
confident that this was not an

00:07:35.088-->00:07:40.093
attack master-minded by North
Korea. Right, so they're coming
out pretty vocal, it's not like,

00:07:40.093-->00:07:45.498
it may be, it's we're pretty,
we're pretty damn confident it's
not them. Then you have Mark

00:07:45.498-->00:07:49.302
coming out basically saying, he
wasn't seeing hard evidence
either and he had some really

00:07:49.302-->00:07:52.272
good articles if you haven't
read you should go to his
website and read, to better

00:07:52.272-->00:07:57.010
understand his point of view,
but he mentioned things like,
the broken English that was

00:07:57.010-->00:08:01.081
being used for attribution
looked really too deliberate.
Right, uh, the code that was

00:08:01.081-->00:08:06.720
written on a PC with the Korean
local, um, makes it actually,
probably not North Korea. Uh,

00:08:06.720-->00:08:11.624
hard coded paths and passwords
and what not, really did uh make
it seem like someone knew that

00:08:11.624-->00:08:15.462
information from Sony from the
inside. And one of the other
things that he said to, was

00:08:15.462-->00:08:20.667
blaming North Korea was an easy
way out for people, uh,
including the security vendors

00:08:20.667-->00:08:24.270
that were brought in and paid
and Sony management and all that
because of that whole Interview

00:08:24.270-->00:08:29.075
move and everything, it was just
sort of an easy way to do it.
And you can see here, even after

00:08:29.075-->00:08:33.279
the FBI started to come out and
saying it was North Korea, he
still saying, I still don't

00:08:33.279-->00:08:39.085
believe that, that's the case.
Kim Zetter from Wired, she
basically published a story

00:08:39.085-->00:08:43.323
saying that the evidence was
flimsy. Ah, again it's a great
article if you want to get some

00:08:43.323-->00:08:47.394
more information about it. And
she was basically saying that
the assertion about who was

00:08:47.394-->00:08:52.866
behind it, um, you should should
be skeptical of these things.
And it's easy for attackers to

00:08:52.866-->00:08:58.571
plant these false flags or point
to North Korea and those sorts
of things and a lot of the

00:08:58.571-->00:09:04.644
evidence that was presented was
circumstantial. Right? And then
here's Dimitri from Crowd

00:09:04.644-->00:09:10.183
Strike, so he comes in and
basically says, North Korea. And
that's it, North Korea, nothing

00:09:10.183-->00:09:14.954
else. Now what funny, is at
Black Hat, I ran into Dimitri
for the first time and I sort of

00:09:14.954-->00:09:19.759
told him, hey Dimitri, your face
is going to pop up several times
in my talk at DefCon and we sort

00:09:19.759-->00:09:24.397
of had a spirited debate for
about an hour. Uh, he still
believes it's North Korea and

00:09:24.397-->00:09:30.170
that's that. Right? Now, what
was also interesting was we
started to see this attribution

00:09:30.170-->00:09:33.973
stuff go really in the
mainstream. Right here you have
Mark Rogers and Dimitri on PBS

00:09:33.973-->00:09:39.112
doing a live debate on
attribution. Who did it, right?
So we're seeing this isn't just,

00:09:39.112-->00:09:42.282
you know, in our industry, it's
starting to come out, more and
more people trying to figure out

00:09:42.282-->00:09:47.754
what's going on. So then we have
Sony and this is sort of
mid-December 2014, they publish

00:09:47.754-->00:09:53.793
a more official update and a
statement basically saying that
as a result of our investigation

00:09:53.793-->00:09:58.798
and close collaboration with
other government agencies, the
FBI has now enough information

00:09:58.798-->00:10:05.371
to conclude that North Korean
government is responsible. So
pretty definitely from the FBI.

00:10:05.371-->00:10:09.976
No matter even though that came
out, we still are seeing Crowd
Strike Verse Norse quite a bit

00:10:09.976-->00:10:15.482
and there were a few others, but
those were the most loudest, if
you will, um talking about this

00:10:15.482-->00:10:19.752
stuff actually FireEye Inc
Mandiant who was hired by Sony,
they also, they were pretty

00:10:19.752-->00:10:24.591
quiet in the press, Kevin
Mandiant did come out and say a
few things such as, um, the the

00:10:24.591-->00:10:30.163
the attacks that happened in
South Korea in 2013 were very
similar, the same, that was

00:10:30.163-->00:10:34.901
being used for Sony, so they
attributed those 2013 hacks to
North Korea, so therefore, it

00:10:34.901-->00:10:39.906
was Sony, or, uh, North Korea
behind this. So we were actually
at RBS, we were documenting this

00:10:42.242-->00:10:45.445
whole thing and we've got this
big article, like a breakdown of
it trying to track everything

00:10:45.445-->00:10:50.149
that was going on. And we
started to think, right, you
have these two, you know, you've

00:10:50.149-->00:10:55.688
got Crowd strike and you've got
Norse, so these two ridiculously
funded VC companies, the hottest

00:10:55.688-->00:10:59.726
threat intelligence, with
ridiculously polar opposite,
like, it's an insider and this

00:10:59.726-->00:11:03.530
is North Korea and they are both
sort of arguing. So it made sort
of start to think, these bold

00:11:03.530-->00:11:09.469
statements, um, if you make this
bold statement and it turns out
to be wrong, does it mean that

00:11:09.469-->00:11:14.407
the intelligence you sell sucks?
Can't be trusted? Right? You
come out and say, oh, this is

00:11:14.407-->00:11:19.178
definitely and in and it's
proven wrong, then is your
product any good? So, what we

00:11:19.178-->00:11:25.652
happen is is in January, so all
that stuffs going on in December
2014, then we see, um, the FBI

00:11:25.652-->00:11:31.891
comes out and again says, hey,
look, it definitely is, um,
North Korea behind this. A week

00:11:31.891-->00:11:36.462
or so after that update, then we
see Krebs come out and say that,
there's some rumors that Norse

00:11:36.462-->00:11:41.601
is about to implode. Right? And
there the ones remember, that
said it was an insider, not

00:11:41.601-->00:11:45.805
North Korea. Whether that has to
do with it or not, it's quite
interesting. Further on that, in

00:11:45.805-->00:11:50.276
March of 2016, you can see this
Tweet, sadness defined, the RSA
booth, it looks like they

00:11:50.276-->00:11:55.415
through down a huge amount of
money for a booth and then it
was just this kind of deserted

00:11:55.415-->00:12:00.153
smaller thing, right? So, not so
good. And everyone was
immediately worried, right?

00:12:00.153-->00:12:05.091
We're going to lose the live
attack map and while most people
that I know could care less

00:12:05.091-->00:12:08.261
about that, they like showing it
to management to get more
budget, right? Like look at

00:12:08.261-->00:12:14.834
that, it's serious stuff in
cyber, right, we need help. But
the good news is we have good

00:12:14.834-->00:12:18.938
old Threatbutt that's come back
to help us again. I'm serious,
right? The Threatbutt Internet

00:12:18.938-->00:12:24.410
Hacking Attack Attribution Map.
And you can see here by
leveraging the patent Crowd

00:12:24.410-->00:12:29.582
Strike technology, they've made
it even better. Right? So they
did give credit to, uh, pew pew,

00:12:29.582-->00:12:35.822
but they make all the threat
stuff better, so. Alright, so
why is this attribution stuff so

00:12:35.822-->00:12:41.828
hard? And it's actually even
hard to put into words. And this
people that will disagree, if

00:12:41.828-->00:12:45.898
you're in this space, I'm sure
you're already upset at me or
Tweeting me back things or

00:12:45.898-->00:12:50.036
whatever, but the reality is,
it's still challenging, right?
So I want to put out a few

00:12:50.036-->00:12:55.208
things of, why attribution in
the cyber space is a little
tricky. So a lot of the

00:12:55.208-->00:12:59.746
attributes that you typically
see in the real world just don't
exist in the cyber world. So

00:12:59.746-->00:13:06.686
that sort of hardcore CSI
forensics investigation work
just isn't as possible, right?

00:13:06.686-->00:13:11.491
It's considered to be easy to
spoof some of these things.
Plant these things. It's

00:13:11.491-->00:13:16.229
considered to be easy to embed
other people's work. Tools,
exploits, malware. You know,

00:13:16.229-->00:13:20.199
just because you see this sample
of this in this particular
attack doesn't mean it was the

00:13:20.199-->00:13:24.237
exact same person, right?
Someone else could have easily
taken that code. Now for people

00:13:24.237-->00:13:28.274
in this space, they'll get a
little snippy sometimes and say,
well if the source code wasn't

00:13:28.274-->00:13:31.678
available, there was no way it
could have been found, I mean,
there's lots of debates about

00:13:31.678-->00:13:36.482
this stuff, but it makes it
challenging. And then that whole
sort of concept of not having a

00:13:36.482-->00:13:42.855
a physical territory right, some
markers that you'll hear in the
cyber warfare world or the

00:13:42.855-->00:13:49.662
traditional warfare world, like
an assembly zone, boundaries to
cross, be able to track things

00:13:49.662-->00:13:53.666
back specifically on missile
launch. All those sorts of
things, they just don't really

00:13:53.666-->00:13:57.904
exist in the cyber space, right?
And honestly, I have so many
slides to get through

00:13:57.904-->00:14:00.707
because as I'm working on this
talk, there's more and more shit
happening. Right, so then we

00:14:00.707-->00:14:07.113
have the DNC that gets hacked,
right? Um, so right. And then
it's actually so bad that Jeff

00:14:07.113-->00:14:13.619
in Blackhat have to decide they
gotta raise some money for them
to get better at security it

00:14:13.619-->00:14:18.024
seems, so. Alright. So, um, this
one we have the, we have the
issue, right and we have

00:14:18.024-->00:14:22.528
Guccifer 2.0 that comes out and
takes credit for the breach,
right? So now we're starting to

00:14:22.528-->00:14:27.333
look at attribution in terms of
taking credit for it. So if you
know anything about the original

00:14:27.333-->00:14:32.338
Guccifer, it was a Romanian man
who hacked, uh, lots of high
profile government accounts,

00:14:32.338-->00:14:37.009
claimed to hack Hilary's private
e-mail servers. All those sorts
of things. And Guccifer 2.0 goes

00:14:37.009-->00:14:42.215
onto say, uh, Guccifer may have
been the first one who
penetrated Hilary and other

00:14:42.215-->00:14:46.452
Democratic mail servers, but he
certainly wasn't the last, no
wonder any other hacker could

00:14:46.452-->00:14:52.358
have easily got into these DNC
servers, right. So then again
now we go immediately into the

00:14:52.358-->00:14:56.929
press to, alright, cyber
attribution and questions there,
right. And so everyone's

00:14:56.929-->00:15:01.334
immediately trying to figure out
who did this and it seems like
an absolute broken record and,

00:15:01.334-->00:15:07.907
uh, Dimitri's back. Right, so,
uh, he's back. And Crowd Strike
tells us, this time it's Russia.

00:15:07.907-->00:15:11.878
Now, what's interesting for this
one, it's a little bit different
for the Sony one, there was a

00:15:11.878-->00:15:16.949
lot of people sort of arguing on
both sides on the Sony one, but
so far, most people seem to

00:15:16.949-->00:15:22.421
agree and are saying that it's
Russia in this particular case.
Actually the only one so far

00:15:22.421-->00:15:26.526
that I've seen that hasn't said
it was Russia, was Donald Trump
was being interviewed and he

00:15:26.526-->00:15:31.998
said something like Russia,
Russia, eh, it's probably China.
So, um, now China's somehow

00:15:31.998-->00:15:37.870
brought in allegedly. But here
we actually have Fidelis,
they're another security company

00:15:37.870-->00:15:42.375
and they came out and they
basically said, they are also
very confident that it's Russian

00:15:42.375-->00:15:48.147
or actors and what they said it
was that they looked at the
code, uh, there was the use of

00:15:48.147-->00:15:53.152
the Russian alphabet keyboard
and the time zone it was
compiled in. Some of the malware

00:15:53.152-->00:15:57.590
on those sorts of things. They
also went on to say that the
evidence pointing to Russia was

00:15:57.590-->00:16:02.662
so convincing, it would have had
to have been a very elaborate
scheme, um, for it to be anyone

00:16:02.662-->00:16:07.667
else. And so that's a little,
um, I don't know. I look at it
and I start thinking, these are

00:16:11.370-->00:16:14.874
the things that people
complained about the last time
around that could be spoofed and

00:16:14.874-->00:16:18.444
all those sorts of problems, so
if it is, the wording that
they're using is a little tough.

00:16:18.444-->00:16:23.883
Alright, so then the media right
now still isn't clear. There's
another article that's

00:16:23.883-->00:16:28.387
publishedsaying, hey is this an
individual? Is this a Russian
front. Um, even though I see

00:16:28.387-->00:16:32.592
most of the security people
agreeing, they're sort of saying
experts aren't so sure, can you

00:16:32.592-->00:16:36.996
imagine that, we don't agree in
the security world. Uh, Crowd
Strike were the ones hired by

00:16:36.996-->00:16:43.369
the DNC, but again everyone does
sort of point to Russia right We
have Clinton stating it's

00:16:43.369-->00:16:49.208
Russia, she draws some sort of
line to Trump maybe, um, it's a
bit confusing because it sounds

00:16:49.208-->00:16:54.313
like the DNC's been owned for a
very long time, so in my mind,
Trump wasn't even considered a

00:16:54.313-->00:16:59.185
candidate then, but now we're
blaming him for potentially even
doing it. And my sort of, the

00:16:59.185-->00:17:04.023
reason why I think this one's
interesting, is because now it's
just not who did it, it's who's

00:17:04.023-->00:17:07.994
behind it trying to orchestrate
and make people do these hacks.
You know, so we're just getting

00:17:07.994-->00:17:12.765
more and more of this sort of
stuff. And the conversation of
what is there to be gained and

00:17:12.765-->00:17:18.004
who can gain from these attacks?
Alright, now we're getting a
little more interesting in the

00:17:18.004-->00:17:24.644
DNC, because shortly after the
DNC, uh, hack was attributed to
Russia, it's now reported that

00:17:24.644-->00:17:28.814
there's a professional
cyber-attack that hit the
Russian government. So we start

00:17:28.814-->00:17:33.819
thinking back back now, right?
And so some articles come out
saying that the NSA is likely

00:17:33.819-->00:17:39.725
hacking back, uh, due to the DNC
hack. Now most of you are giving
me blank looks, dirty looks

00:17:39.725-->00:17:43.663
saying, hey, you think this is
the first time that we haven't
been hacking all over the place?

00:17:43.663-->00:17:48.067
The NSA hasn't been hacking. But
other people will say and start
to believe that this may be the

00:17:48.067-->00:17:53.072
first major time you know that a
sanction nation state hack back
has occurred, right? So we just

00:17:53.072-->00:17:58.210
keep going down this path. So it
leads us to the question of,
does it actually matter if we

00:17:58.210-->00:18:02.748
get cyber hack attribution
correct? Do we even care, right?
For most companies and

00:18:02.748-->00:18:07.153
organizations where you work,
does it really matter who
attacked you? You've got to deal

00:18:07.153-->00:18:11.157
with the breach, you got to deal
with the problem. The fact that
you got hacked is the issue.

00:18:11.157-->00:18:15.494
That's not going to change a
whole lot about financials or
whatever else, right? Uh, but

00:18:15.494-->00:18:20.666
for other cyber attribution, it
does really matter. Because
after the Sony attack, right,

00:18:20.666-->00:18:25.471
when the FBI concluded it was
North Korea and the USA imposed
sanctions on North Korea in

00:18:25.471-->00:18:30.476
response. In February of 2016,
Congress sends North Korea cyber
sanctions bill to Obama, uh,

00:18:33.646-->00:18:38.084
saying that anyone that's caught
aiding the country's cyber cane,
they're going to get penalties

00:18:38.084-->00:18:44.290
now as well. So we're seeing the
attribution leading to real
world things. So last month,

00:18:44.290-->00:18:48.961
North Korea expressed their
thoughts about the US sanctions.
Uh, the foreign ministry issued

00:18:48.961-->00:18:53.866
a statement carried by the
Korean Central News Agency,
basically saying the sanctions

00:18:53.866-->00:19:00.072
on Kim and ten other and
officials were peppered with
lies and fabrication and then

00:19:00.072-->00:19:05.478
went on to say that now that the
US has declared war on the DPRK,
any problem arising in relations

00:19:05.478-->00:19:10.182
with the US will be handled
under the latters wartime law.
So we're seeing things, even

00:19:10.182-->00:19:14.020
though there's a lot of rhetoric
that comes out of certain
countries, we're seeing things

00:19:14.020-->00:19:19.325
escalate base on attribution.
And then just a few days ago,
um, now it's reported that the

00:19:19.325-->00:19:23.596
United States is considering
economic sanctions on Russia for
hacking, right? The various

00:19:23.596-->00:19:28.768
activities in cyber space, that
economic sanctions have been
used before and they could

00:19:28.768-->00:19:35.274
possibly be used in preparing
for response of cyber threats.
So how can we actually figure

00:19:35.274-->00:19:40.913
out what's going on behind these
hacks? Um, No, or why can't we
might be a better question,

00:19:40.913-->00:19:45.851
right? Those security firms
typically tend to agree. Uh, we
can't trust when people are

00:19:45.851-->00:19:51.791
claiming attacks, easy to hide
IP addresses via proxy servers,
Tor, etc. Correlations as we've

00:19:51.791-->00:19:55.861
already talked about between
certain pieces of malware really
aren't just hard evidence,

00:19:55.861-->00:20:01.133
although people in this space
will debate that to death. Uh,
information and evidence many

00:20:01.133-->00:20:06.739
times isn't fully shared, uh to
protect sources. So just say,
trust me, this is what it is.

00:20:06.739-->00:20:11.477
And then there's this whole
behavioral analysis of of doing
analysis of writings and things

00:20:11.477-->00:20:16.916
like that, which doesn't come
across to many as very hard
evidence. So then as we go from

00:20:16.916-->00:20:21.320
there, then the question becomes
do we actually need to improve
our cyber attribution

00:20:21.320-->00:20:26.358
capabilities. And you know I
don't really care for the folks
that think that they're doing it

00:20:26.358-->00:20:30.429
really awesome and it's well
enough or perfect, that's great.
There's still, uh, others that

00:20:30.429-->00:20:34.333
they aren't so sure, but I think
that if we're going to be
punishing countries and getting

00:20:34.333-->00:20:38.104
more of this act of war
rhetoric, we better be damn sure
that when we come out and say

00:20:38.104-->00:20:41.974
something that we actually know
what's going on and so
regardless of whether you're on

00:20:41.974-->00:20:46.112
one side or the other in terms
of how we are with attribution
right now, I think we can all

00:20:46.112-->00:20:50.282
agree that we need to continue
to invest in and improve a
digital attribution. It's clear

00:20:50.282-->00:20:53.986
that the impact could have and
there are a lot of smart people
working on this, so I think

00:20:53.986-->00:21:00.226
that's great. Alright, so this
leads us to the Arrest Tracker
Project. So what we wanted to do

00:21:00.226-->00:21:05.364
was we want to collect data to
hopefully better understand, um,
what's going on with cyber

00:21:05.364-->00:21:11.937
crimes, right. Another view
point, of to attribution and of
much different lens, right? And

00:21:11.937-->00:21:15.808
so, Arrest Tracker was
originally founded by Lee
Johnstone, uh, he's also the

00:21:15.808-->00:21:19.945
founder of Cyber War News if
you've ever follow any of his
stuff, really smart researcher

00:21:19.945-->00:21:25.317
and so was founded 2013. Uh and
the project aims to track
computer intrusion incidents

00:21:25.317-->00:21:31.857
resulting in arrest, detaining
of persons, uh, seizure of goods
and all sorts of other things.

00:21:31.857-->00:21:36.295
Uh, tracking incidents from all
cyber - again if you have
alcohol, drink. I've been trying

00:21:36.295-->00:21:40.399
to say it as much as I can.
Also, if you notice in the lower
right hand corner it says cyber

00:21:40.399-->00:21:45.404
on every slide, so, I wanted to
make sure we were gonna get to
where we needed to for later

00:21:45.404-->00:21:51.977
tonight. Um, and hacking related
incidents. Um, so right now
there's over 1400 incidents

00:21:51.977-->00:21:55.814
collected and it's more than
just arrests, but we ended up
finding out that there's there,

00:21:55.814-->00:21:59.385
if you just say you're only
going to track arrests, there's
a lot that goes on, so there's,

00:21:59.385-->00:22:04.290
it's it's, it's more than that,
we're labeling it cyber-crime.
And now, uh, as of today, the

00:22:04.290-->00:22:09.261
project is officially launching,
you can go out and sign up and
check things out, etc. So it's

00:22:09.261-->00:22:14.466
Arrest Tracker dot com. So the,
uh, fields in there, we're
trying to figure out all the

00:22:14.466-->00:22:19.205
different fields that we're
trying to track and with any
project, if you've ever done

00:22:19.205-->00:22:22.508
data work, you start out and try
to track a few fields and all of
a sudden you're like what about

00:22:22.508-->00:22:26.512
these and you keep adding stuff
on, right? Um, but so far we're
trying to figure out things like

00:22:26.512-->00:22:31.350
the profile, the name, alias,
gender, age, location are they
part of hacker collectives,

00:22:31.350-->00:22:35.254
operations, all those sorts of
things. In terms of the
incident, when did it occur,

00:22:35.254-->00:22:39.792
which country, arrested charge,
rated, all that sort of stuff.
And then even then looking at

00:22:39.792-->00:22:45.798
things like courts. Um, was
there a deal, was there trial,
fines, fine amounts, convicted,

00:22:45.798-->00:22:50.035
sentenced, all those sorts of
things. And even some more
things about, um, the legal side

00:22:50.035-->00:22:56.575
and authorities. Alright, so
what can Arrest Tracker help us
with? Well, first we definitely

00:22:56.575-->00:23:00.846
need to recognize there's some
limitations with the date,
right? So some quick

00:23:00.846-->00:23:05.684
disclaimers. So if you're a data
scientist or uh a data security
metrics nerd and you want to

00:23:05.684-->00:23:09.388
come give me grief, I get it.
But we're trying to start
somewhere and grow this so we

00:23:09.388-->00:23:13.592
can have some data sets to look
at as we improve and get better,
but you have to remember, uh

00:23:13.592-->00:23:18.030
there are some limitations. We
have to remember that this is
mostly about arrest data, right.

00:23:18.030-->00:23:23.302
Arrest incidences is what we
have the most of and so it tells
a story from that viewpoint. Uh,

00:23:23.302-->00:23:27.573
we've expanded, as mentioned to
cover more cyber-crime, we're
going continue to add as much as

00:23:27.573-->00:23:33.812
we can. We're using data based
on reported, uh, arrests and
raids, right, so we're gathering

00:23:33.812-->00:23:38.851
everything we can from the
media. So if the reporting's bad
or wrong it's an issue. Right,

00:23:38.851-->00:23:42.788
we do source everything in there
to try to have our own
attribution to where we got the

00:23:42.788-->00:23:48.127
information from. And if the
courts are wrong, which when has
that every happened, right. Um,

00:23:48.127-->00:23:53.599
that's an issue too, but we're
pulling all the data that we can
in and putting it in. So we also

00:23:53.599-->00:23:58.203
need to remember that in many
cases the government allegedly
would rather track and follow

00:23:58.203-->00:24:02.207
criminals instead of arresting
them for various reasons. So
again, we're only, we're only

00:24:02.207-->00:24:06.412
adding in data here that, that
has had some sort of, uh, some
sort of crime prosecution,

00:24:06.412-->00:24:12.217
arrest, etc. So with that said,
what can Arrest Tracker tell us?
Well, quite a bit actually, um,

00:24:12.217-->00:24:17.323
so, detailed statistics about
crime arrests, who's behind
these data breaches and crime,

00:24:17.323-->00:24:21.994
what are the demographics,
what's going on with
extradition, details on census,

00:24:21.994-->00:24:27.566
monetary fines. Um, learning
about law enforcement and what's
going on certain judges and how

00:24:27.566-->00:24:32.404
do they view cases. And then
profile a hacker and I'm sure
anything else that you guys can

00:24:32.404-->00:24:37.810
think of we can ask the data
set. So most people always are
asking us, you know, what is a

00:24:37.810-->00:24:41.413
hacker, what's the profile a
hacker and you know the media
basically settled in on the ski

00:24:41.413-->00:24:45.951
mask behind the laptop, right?
We all agree on that. I sort of
thought it might be funny and

00:24:45.951-->00:24:50.189
interesting if I ask Google
images of what it was and here
it is and what I found here is

00:24:50.189-->00:24:55.461
as long as you have a hoodie on,
you're a hacker in Google's
mind. But we also have couple

00:24:55.461-->00:25:00.833
new faces now with Mr. Robot,
right? So now these new faces of
what a hacker is. But what's

00:25:00.833-->00:25:05.237
even more interesting is these
are the real faces from Arrest
Tracker behind the project,

00:25:05.237-->00:25:08.974
right? So we're tracking what
what folks look like and all
those sorts of things as well,

00:25:08.974-->00:25:15.647
so you can see, uh, this helps
us better understand. So looking
at the timeline. Here's, uh, an

00:25:15.647-->00:25:20.085
eye chart for people way in the
back. Um, shows that there's
been crime and incidents going

00:25:20.085-->00:25:25.758
back to the 1970s, right? Uh,
there was some you can see that
over the course, but really not

00:25:25.758-->00:25:31.096
a lot of activity in this space.
Or incidents that we've tracked
until the 2000s. If you drill in

00:25:31.096-->00:25:35.434
closer on the 2000s, you can see
that things are on the rise
without a doubt, right, we're

00:25:35.434-->00:25:40.839
seeing a lot more activity in
this space. So the cyber
incidents over the past decades,

00:25:40.839-->00:25:45.844
the 70s we saw 2, 80s 37, 1990,
uh 59 incidents and the 2000s
345 and the and current decade

00:25:50.449-->00:25:55.988
998 incidents. So we're seeing
quite a bit that we're adding
in. Now, that being said, there

00:25:55.988-->00:26:00.292
is a lot of old research, so,
uh, Jericho Vertrition dot org
has on it's to do list. It's

00:26:00.292-->00:26:03.996
been on it for a while actually,
I've going to have to give them
some grief, to go through some

00:26:03.996-->00:26:07.966
of these old books and pull out
some more incidents from the 70s
and 80s, so definitely need more

00:26:07.966-->00:26:12.471
help and more research putting
in some of the older things as
well. So the oldest incident

00:26:12.471-->00:26:18.410
from the 70s we actually have is
from 1971. And that's just a
screenshot of what the, uh,

00:26:18.410-->00:26:22.581
Arrest Profile looks like where
we're trying to capture all the
different bits of data. And so

00:26:22.581-->00:26:29.555
you can see here, Hugh Jefferey
Ward it occurred in '71. He was
29 years old at the time. He was

00:26:29.555-->00:26:34.560
accused of breaking into the ISD
computer systems and stealing
data. Uh, trade secret theft,

00:26:34.560-->00:26:39.565
plead guilty. Fined 5000 dollars
and 36 months of probation. So
that's 1971. Now, does anyone

00:26:44.102-->00:26:49.107
recognize this picture? That's
laughing, but does anyone really
know it? The guy that had the

00:26:51.376-->00:26:56.381
most friends on the internet for
a while. This is Tom! There we
go. This is MySpace Tom. So

00:26:58.650-->00:27:04.623
MySpace Tom, um, maybe people
don't know this, he was a
co-founder of MySpace, but the

00:27:04.623-->00:27:09.628
media back here reported him as
a real life war games hacker in
the 1980s. And so he was also

00:27:11.964-->00:27:16.969
known as Lord Flathead, aka
Myspace Tom and so this is his
profile in Arrest Tracker. And

00:27:19.004-->00:27:24.343
so 1985 he had an issue, he was
about 14 or 16 at the time,
there's some conflicting reports

00:27:24.343-->00:27:29.414
there. But he, uh, hacked,
allegedlyhacked into Chase
Manhattan Bank, told his friends

00:27:29.414-->00:27:35.721
how to do it, uh, the FBI, uh
raided him in California and
ceased all of, uh, his

00:27:35.721-->00:27:41.159
computers. And so no charges or
criminal convictions have ever
been made in related to this

00:27:41.159-->00:27:45.264
incident. He was a minor at this
time. So again that's one of
those reasons, why we expanded

00:27:45.264-->00:27:50.302
out the project just saying
these arrests into tracking a
bit more stuff. So 1980s,

00:27:50.302-->00:27:54.473
MySpace Tom. And what's
interesting about this, as we've
been collecting each of these

00:27:54.473-->00:27:59.378
incidents about the people and
what's going on. Each incident
in Arrest Tracker has this story

00:27:59.378-->00:28:04.583
to be told, right? And so, from
the 90s, you know we pulled out
some folks, the Mitnick story's

00:28:04.583-->00:28:09.154
been told many times, even last
night, you know we had the movie
night of the 2600 stuff. But

00:28:09.154-->00:28:12.891
there's many other people in
here that each have their own
story to be told. Here's from

00:28:12.891-->00:28:18.830
the 2000s. Some notables that
you may recognize or not. Um,
but some of these folks that you

00:28:18.830-->00:28:22.868
may not know what they were up
to and they have their own
story. And then and here some

00:28:22.868-->00:28:27.272
more recent incidents and then
some of them have some really
bad and sad consequences of our

00:28:27.272-->00:28:33.145
legal system as well. So there's
lots of other notable arrests
out there for various reasons.

00:28:33.145-->00:28:37.683
Things like the first
prosecution of a particular
crime, the severity of a crime,

00:28:37.683-->00:28:42.888
the length of a jail crime, or
what the fines were, potential
overreaching of regulatory

00:28:42.888-->00:28:47.893
actions, impact to those
accused, etc. Alright, some
specifics on arrests. So we get

00:28:50.762-->00:28:54.866
asked just absolutely all the
time, anytime we mention Arrest
Tracker, it's the profile of a

00:28:54.866-->00:28:58.437
hacker. That's the biggest
question that comes up. So we
knew that once we had a fair

00:28:58.437-->00:29:02.741
amount of data, we need to start
looking at demographic of
things. And so we started with

00:29:02.741-->00:29:08.213
age. And so the youngest age
that we have is 12 years old.
Believe it or not. Traded

00:29:08.213-->00:29:14.753
pirated information to the
activist group anonymous for
video games. Um, so. Sentenced

00:29:14.753-->00:29:20.692
to 18 months. Includes limited
access to internet devices, 30
hours of community service. And

00:29:20.692-->00:29:25.764
under supervision for 6 months,
uh, the boy must also, had to
choose some sort of structured

00:29:25.764-->00:29:30.702
activity of his choosing. And
this was in 2013 in in Canada.
So 12 years old was the

00:29:30.702-->00:29:37.609
youngest. And the oldest though,
was 66 years old. Um, Uh John
McHugh, a guy named Devil Man as

00:29:37.609-->00:29:43.215
well. Male, busted for selling
cards on the dark web. Uh, this
was in the United Kingdom and he

00:29:43.215-->00:29:48.487
was jailed for two years. So you
can see this one. And so what
that led us to look at is we

00:29:48.487-->00:29:53.158
knew we had the youngest at 12
and the oldest at 66, but what's
sort of the breakdown and the

00:29:53.158-->00:29:57.529
distribution of ages, right?
Most people when you say whose
hacking, whose doing all this

00:29:57.529-->00:30:02.134
stuff, it's some bored high
schooler or, uh, ya know, or
some college university student

00:30:02.134-->00:30:08.573
on spring break. Um, but what we
saw from the distributions is
you can see 18 through 25, 349

00:30:08.573-->00:30:14.413
incidents and 26 through 35, 304
incidents. So were the largest
groups while there were still

00:30:14.413-->00:30:20.218
other age groups. And that
currently leads us to an average
age of 27 years old. And then we

00:30:20.218-->00:30:24.589
want to look at that 27 year
olds across all the years to
see, ya know, was it, how was it

00:30:24.589-->00:30:29.494
year over year and it was, it
was pretty spot on, year over
year in that range. Alright,

00:30:29.494-->00:30:34.032
gender equality. There's been a
lot talked about this all over
the place and so we though, hey,

00:30:34.032-->00:30:37.869
we should look at the same thing
to see, ya know, what's the
breakdown in genders. Uh, uh,

00:30:37.869-->00:30:42.874
for crime and arrests and yeah,
it's all guys. [laughter] So we
still have a little more

00:30:46.044-->00:30:52.017
research to do here, um, but in
general it was 81 plus percent
were male. Um, and so we're

00:30:52.017-->00:30:55.153
going to do a little bit more
work in this space, but again,
just trying to get those profile

00:30:55.153-->00:31:00.926
demographics. So which countries
do most hackers reside in or
what's in our world, what's the

00:31:00.926-->00:31:06.064
country of origin for the
arrests? Um, we get asked this
all the time as well and

00:31:06.064-->00:31:09.501
everyone really thinks it's just
gonna be this, ya know, it's
gonna be China, right, this is

00:31:09.501-->00:31:14.372
what it looks like with just
Chinese hackers everywhere. Um,
but again, if you think about

00:31:14.372-->00:31:19.945
what we're doing with the arrest
data it's based on arrest data,
right? And so obviously for us,

00:31:19.945-->00:31:24.649
United States is number one,
right? You can see there. Note
that China's number ten in this.

00:31:24.649-->00:31:30.122
So there are arrests and there
are crime, uh, things going on,
but because of the data and the

00:31:30.122-->00:31:33.725
lens that we're looking through,
number one is the United States
and number two is the United

00:31:33.725-->00:31:39.431
Kingdom. Now collectives, we
wanted to get our heads wrapped
around, do most folks that get

00:31:39.431-->00:31:45.871
in trouble, um, in a cyber-crime
area, are they sort of solo,
like lone wolf hackers on their

00:31:45.871-->00:31:52.544
own. Or are they part of some
sort of collective? And also, if
one person gets arrested, does

00:31:52.544-->00:31:56.481
that lead, does that mean that
like a bunch of others are gonna
follow? And so Arrest Tracker,

00:31:56.481-->00:32:02.187
there's 58 known collectives
that have had some sort of
confirmed incident. And we see

00:32:02.187-->00:32:06.424
that anonymous is at the top
with 130. So anytime that we'll
find out about an issue, if it's

00:32:06.424-->00:32:10.829
related to back to a collective
then we go ahead and add it in.
Same thing with hacker

00:32:10.829-->00:32:14.900
operations, we want to start
trying to get a better feel,
when you talk about these hacker

00:32:14.900-->00:32:18.637
operations and what they're
going after, ya know, how many
are they and and what do they

00:32:18.637-->00:32:22.274
lead to in terms of arrests or
or any crime sort of
prosecution, right now we know

00:32:22.274-->00:32:28.380
about 21 hacker ops. Um, with
operation payback at the top.
And for some of you old school

00:32:28.380-->00:32:31.449
folks in there, you'll laugh at
a couple other ones that are
listed up there as well.

00:32:31.449-->00:32:33.451
Alright, so is an arrest
inevitable? Are you definitely
going to get arrested? So if you

00:32:33.451-->00:32:36.922
look at it in terms of the data
breaches, right, so in 2016 year
to date we already said there is

00:32:36.922-->00:32:38.924
approximately 2000 data
breaches, year to date. We've
seen 70 confirmed arrests so far

00:32:38.924-->00:32:44.229
and 2015 there were
approximately 4000 data breaches
and we saw 134 confirmed

00:32:44.229-->00:32:46.231
arrests. Going back to 2014 sort
of the same message, right,
approximately 3000 data

00:32:46.231-->00:32:48.233
breaches, about 47 arrested. So
nowhere are we seeing, um, ya
know the, in terms of a data

00:32:48.233-->00:32:53.238
breach equaling arrests, right?
Um, and what's interesting is
the data so far shows that

00:33:10.555-->00:33:17.095
there's 610 days on average from
when a crime happens, if you
will, until the incident, or the

00:33:17.095-->00:33:21.833
arrest. So there's definitely a
tail from when something occurs
to when there's some sort of

00:33:21.833-->00:33:25.804
prosecution or raid or whatever
and we're going to continue to
add data and stats in that

00:33:25.804-->00:33:31.943
regard. Alright, so we then we
started to wonder, maybe silly
things, but when would you most

00:33:31.943-->00:33:36.948
likely to be raided or arrested?
Which would it be? Anyone have a
guess? [audience responses] I

00:33:39.784-->00:33:46.691
think I heard it over here.
Hello, Monday! Right. So someone
maybe had a bad case of the

00:33:46.691-->00:33:50.896
Mondays, could be really bad,
right? Um, we originally guessed
when we thought about it, we

00:33:50.896-->00:33:54.099
thought it's be on a Friday, but
it looks like looking at the
data, you get to enjoy your

00:33:54.099-->00:33:59.104
weekend and then on Monday it's
gonna be a real bad day for you
potentially. And then we started

00:33:59.104-->00:34:02.941
asking other questions like what
part of the year, what month
would it be, right? And Arrest

00:34:02.941-->00:34:07.012
Tracker could tell us that same
thing. No one ever gets this one
right, so I won't even ask you

00:34:07.012-->00:34:12.017
guys, but April seems to be when
more showers can come into the
hacker community as well. So now

00:34:14.352-->00:34:20.058
countries pursuing cyber-crime.
As you can easily guess, USA's
the most active number one,

00:34:20.058-->00:34:25.196
right. But the top ten's
somewhat surprising in some
cases and and China, no, that

00:34:25.196-->00:34:30.735
they're not, they're not in the
top ten of pursuing cyber-crime,
ok? Umm, we started to look at

00:34:30.735-->00:34:36.641
things like extradition,
extradition And we're currently
seeing that only the USA has

00:34:36.641-->00:34:41.313
any, uh, extraditions that are
tracked and there's 42 of them
that we're aware of and so you

00:34:41.313-->00:34:46.918
can see the top five countries.
Russia to the United States had
8, uh, Romania to the US 7.

00:34:46.918-->00:34:53.491
Estonia to the US 6. Canada to
the US at, uh 3 and the United
Kingdom 3 as well. Not every

00:34:53.491-->00:34:58.630
country allows the USA to
extradite folks, but there are
treaties in place with more than

00:34:58.630-->00:35:03.668
100, 100 countries out there.
Here's a quick little map of it,
you can see in the darker

00:35:03.668-->00:35:08.540
purplish, uh color, that's the
USA and all the blue ones are
places that we allegedly,

00:35:08.540-->00:35:13.545
according to Wikipedia, have,
uh, extradition treaties. So now
we looked at jail time. The

00:35:15.847-->00:35:20.719
longest jail time that we had,
the worst case, we thought what
would that be and what we found

00:35:20.719-->00:35:25.724
was it was actually crazy. 334
years. So, uh, a guy in Turkey
he created fake websites and

00:35:27.959-->00:35:32.998
impersonated banks and I think
the lesson that Arrest Tracker
all of you right now is don't

00:35:32.998-->00:35:38.603
mess around in Turkey, because
it's bad news there in terms of
jail time. Right. We started

00:35:38.603-->00:35:42.841
look at fines and we want to
understand things, what's the
average fine, what's the most

00:35:42.841-->00:35:44.843
common, uh, the largest fine,
etc and what we found is the
average fine that we know of

00:35:44.843-->00:35:46.845
right now is a million US
dollars, but the most common
fine that we, that occurred 13

00:35:46.845-->00:35:48.847
times, uh within the database,
was 5600 dollars. The largest
fine was, uh, the world pay

00:35:48.847-->00:35:53.852
hacker Victor, 8 point 9 million
US dollars and he was convicted
and tried in a Russian court

00:36:01.626-->00:36:06.631
under FBI charges. The other
thing too that goes on is
there's some people that just

00:36:09.834-->00:36:15.006
can't help themself, they just
can't stop. Um, so many times
you know, there'll be cases,

00:36:15.006-->00:36:19.077
multiple cases, that are
consolidated into one case so
this can be a little bit hard to

00:36:19.077-->00:36:25.216
figure out sometimes, but we've
been able to find Arrest
Tracker, uh, 17 people have had

00:36:25.216-->00:36:30.655
multiple arrests. And we're
asked all the time, this is
another question we get asked

00:36:30.655-->00:36:34.993
all the time, is how many people
when they get busted are
assisting authorities. And so we

00:36:34.993-->00:36:40.065
do have the fields in Arrest
Tracker to track this, however,
it is pretty rare and it's hard

00:36:40.065-->00:36:43.902
to find this data, but when
looking through the database
right now, there are 30 people

00:36:43.902-->00:36:49.274
that have confirmed, uh, to
have, uh, assisted the
authorities in some fashion.

00:36:49.274-->00:36:55.747
Alright, so getting down to this
what is a profile of hacker? So
the data suggests that really

00:36:55.747-->00:37:00.151
there's no single hacker or
cyber-criminal type, right, that
sort of a bit all over the

00:37:00.151-->00:37:02.153
place, but if, uh, we were
forced to say what the profile
of a hacker is based on averages

00:37:02.153-->00:37:04.322
and things that we can find, uh,
genders gonna be a male, age
range is gonna be 18-35 or in

00:37:04.322-->00:37:09.327
that average 27 age range.
Again, gonna be in the USA, a
lot of that is because again the

00:37:16.067-->00:37:19.204
arrest data that we source, but
if not USA, it's gonna be UK or
Phillippines. Uh, the crime will

00:37:19.204-->00:37:25.944
be hacking. If it's not hacking,
then after that, it'd be some
sort of cyber fraud or data

00:37:25.944-->00:37:30.949
theft that we classify. And most
likely active since year 2000.
Motivation right now, still

00:37:33.284-->00:37:37.021
having problems tracking that in
a relevant way, so we're still
trying to figure what we can do

00:37:37.021-->00:37:43.628
in Arrest Tracker to make that a
bit more clear. Alright, most
wanted. Who hasn't been arrested

00:37:43.628-->00:37:47.899
yet? Well, I'm not sure if
everyone knows this or not, but
the FBI at their website

00:37:47.899-->00:37:52.570
maintains a listing of wanted
cyber folks. You can go out
there and check it out. There

00:37:52.570-->00:37:58.743
are 28 total listed as of just
this this week. Uh, they have a
profile basically on everyone

00:37:58.743-->00:38:03.681
that's listed up there, so
they'll have your, ya know, your
picture and a wanted poster and

00:38:03.681-->00:38:08.019
an alias and whole bunch of
other information, ya know
weight, eye color, all that sort

00:38:08.019-->00:38:13.124
of stuff and then details on the
rewards that they'll offer if
you can help bring them down.

00:38:13.124-->00:38:18.229
Some other remarks. Um, and
there's this other section
that's called "caution" that

00:38:18.229-->00:38:22.300
I'll put a lot more details on
what they're up to and even
mention things like if they're

00:38:22.300-->00:38:27.872
considered a flight risk and all
those sorts of stuff. And in
this particular case, uh, offer

00:38:27.872-->00:38:32.610
a reward up to 3 million dollars
for information leading to the
arrest or conviction of this

00:38:32.610-->00:38:37.615
particular guy. So you can see
here, here's a listing from all
the images from the website. Um,

00:38:39.817-->00:38:43.888
the profile looks a little
different than the arrest data
that we've been talking about,

00:38:43.888-->00:38:48.860
right? Um and what's
interesting, if you had to guess
the total amount of reward money

00:38:48.860-->00:38:55.200
all added up, uh, it's about 4
point 49 million dollars in
potential rewards if all these

00:38:55.200-->00:39:00.138
people were, someone informed
them to the FBI. What we're also
starting to see too is that, um,

00:39:03.341-->00:39:08.446
when hackers or doxed or when
information becomes aware, are
they definitely going to get

00:39:08.446-->00:39:14.352
arrested? And so what we saw in
March of 2016 is GhostShell,
many of you know. Uh, doxed

00:39:14.352-->00:39:19.857
himself, he revealed himself, uh
and he described that he's been
active since January 2012. That

00:39:19.857-->00:39:23.661
he was one of the ones that
started OpRomania. He's attacked
the government, all those sorts

00:39:23.661-->00:39:29.634
of things. So this is, you know,
March 2016, but then here he's
leaking 39 million accounts in

00:39:29.634-->00:39:34.505
protest and that was in June,
right, so. All the information
about him, he came out and

00:39:34.505-->00:39:39.077
basically said everything. Who
he was, etc, but he's still
active. And so it's clear that

00:39:39.077-->00:39:42.780
for us, we still want to make
sure we understand a bit more
about law enforcement specific

00:39:42.780-->00:39:47.252
about cases. Are there certain
characteristics of data breaches
or cyber-crime that leads to

00:39:47.252-->00:39:51.956
more law influence. Um, those
sorts of things. So we're trying
to track more on that, so we can

00:39:51.956-->00:39:57.362
get a better answer. Alright, so
as we're wrapping up here now.
So what's next for us? Well the

00:39:57.362-->00:40:01.299
actions are clear for us, is
data quality is top of our mind.
We want to make sure that we

00:40:01.299-->00:40:05.370
continue to have the best data,
that we can have everything that
we need to so these, we can

00:40:05.370-->00:40:09.774
answer these questions as as
best as we can, but at the same
time answer all the questions

00:40:09.774-->00:40:14.045
that people have for us. So if
you find something wrong and you
log into the project, please

00:40:14.045-->00:40:17.482
tell us. Right, there's no pride
in authorship, we want wanna we
wanna fix things up. We care

00:40:17.482-->00:40:22.053
about the data, we want it to be
accurate. And we want more data.
We want to increase coverage of

00:40:22.053-->00:40:26.858
cyber-crime events. We want more
data fields per incident by
person. All those sorts of

00:40:26.858-->00:40:31.763
things. So if you're interested
in helping out, please do. For
future ideas and features that

00:40:31.763-->00:40:36.100
we're looking at. We're trying
to add more data, uh, field
about individual persons. So the

00:40:36.100-->00:40:38.102
ability to handle complex
issues. Things you wouldn't
necessarily think like, uh, a

00:40:38.102-->00:40:40.104
Romanian national that lived in
Canada for 15 years, but then
was arrested in the United

00:40:40.104-->00:40:42.106
States, right? We want to be
able to try to track some of
those things. When we ask, we

00:40:42.106-->00:40:44.108
get asked about location and
profile, we can explain it a bit
more. A lot of, a lot of

00:40:44.108-->00:40:46.110
thoughts been going in the
ability to track motivation. And
then mapping to known data

00:40:46.110-->00:40:48.112
breaches so we can understand
impacts and all those sorts of
things. Ya know, are there

00:40:48.112-->00:41:07.165
certain types of hacker profiles
that go on after certain types
of industries, etc. More work on

00:41:07.165-->00:41:10.468
the most wanted. Uh, some
thoughts we've had about are, ya
know, are how long are they on

00:41:10.468-->00:41:15.173
the most wanted before they get
arrested. Um, things like that.
Now how many people that have

00:41:15.173-->00:41:21.012
been arrested were for security
companies, right? Um and then
even a subsection for piracy and

00:41:21.012-->00:41:26.117
all those sorts of things. So
what comes next? Are we gonna
see arrests in cyber-crime

00:41:26.117-->00:41:31.389
prosecution increase or
decrease? We think the answer is
gonna be increasing. Um, we're

00:41:31.389-->00:41:35.426
trying to figure out what the
legal environments gonna look
like and if that's gonna get

00:41:35.426-->00:41:40.798
more harsh. Um and then can we
take this data from Arrest
Tracker and actually apply it to

00:41:40.798-->00:41:45.370
your work, right. Can you use
this to help you, not just, ya
know, laugh about yeah it's

00:41:45.370-->00:41:49.874
Monday and April and those sorts
of things, but if you're in the
legal space, can you look at how

00:41:49.874-->00:41:54.512
things are happening. Are there
overreaching regulations in your
day to day job. Can this help

00:41:54.512-->00:41:59.016
you figure out how to be
offensive, etc. So we're open
for new ideas. If you're

00:41:59.016-->00:42:02.086
interested in working with us,
we'd love it. If you've got
other ideas, we're open to that

00:42:02.086-->00:42:06.691
feedback. And if you want to
help, definitely please contact
us. So I want to thank, uh, Lee

00:42:06.691-->00:42:10.995
Johnstone for all his hard work
founding the Arrest Tracker
project. It's a ton of data,

00:42:10.995-->00:42:15.900
it's a ton of work. I wanna
thank Brian Martin for all his
help. Um, I want to thank

00:42:15.900-->00:42:19.904
everyone else that's been
interested and hung out here and
been drinking with us for this

00:42:19.904-->00:42:24.642
session. And thanks to the
DefCon CFB team for, uh, for the
opportunity to present. So

00:42:24.642-->00:42:29.647
believe it or not, this was 140
slides and cyber was pretty much
on every single one of them. So

00:42:29.647-->00:42:32.750
I hope you guys had fun playing
along. Look forward to seeing
you tonight. If you have

00:42:32.750-->00:42:37.755
questions, I'll be up here.
Thank you. [applause]
