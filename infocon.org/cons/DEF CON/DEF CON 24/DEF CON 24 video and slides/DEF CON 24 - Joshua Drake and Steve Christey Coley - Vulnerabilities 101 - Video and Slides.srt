00:00:00.567,00:00:03.971
>> So, uh, welcome. for-,
thank you for joining us this

00:00:03.971,00:00:07.808
morning. It's super, uh, super
not late... but early. [chuckle]

00:00:07.808,00:00:10.077
>> Someone followed the "Three,
two, one rule" to the letter

00:00:10.077,00:00:15.482
last night, didn't they? >> Yea,
sorry... [laughter] >> Yea... >>

00:00:15.482,00:00:19.019
My bad. [audience noise] [pause]
Hey, but at least I got three...

00:00:19.019,00:00:22.322
So, uh, in, in case you don't
know where you are - we're doing

00:00:22.322,00:00:25.926
Vulns 1 0 1 in here. Uh,
hopefully everyone can learn a

00:00:25.926,00:00:28.161
little bit of something. We all
wanted to ask a couple of

00:00:28.161,00:00:31.231
questions before we jump in
further. Uh, number one, like,

00:00:31.231,00:00:35.669
how many people here is their
first DefCon? [cheering] >> Wow!

00:00:35.669,00:00:39.473
>> Alright, nice... [applause]
>> That's very nice. [applause]

00:00:39.473,00:00:43.610
So how many... Uh, what was the
other question we wanted to ask?

00:00:43.610,00:00:46.647
>> How many of you here are, are
here for this talk? You've just

00:00:46.647,00:00:49.383
started out in vulnerability
research and you wanna, uh,

00:00:49.383,00:00:54.054
learn how to improve your game.
[pause] [audience noise] Okay,

00:00:54.054,00:00:57.524
and how... An, and how many of
you are not familiar with

00:00:57.524,00:01:00.427
research but you're curious
about it and so that's why you

00:01:00.427,00:01:05.599
came here? [pause] >> It's about
even. >> Okay, good. >> That

00:01:05.599,00:01:09.903
doesn't help us anyway, but
thanks. [laughter] >> The, the,

00:01:09.903,00:01:12.539
yea. WHat we realized a little
bit, uh, earlier this week as we

00:01:12.539,00:01:16.443
were practising is that we were
trying to target two audiences -

00:01:16.443,00:01:19.046
uh, newbies and then people who
were curious about vulnerability

00:01:19.046,00:01:22.449
research but didn't know much
about it. And so, sometimes for

00:01:22.449,00:01:24.451
those who are curious about it
we might go into some

00:01:24.451,00:01:27.888
terminology you might not be
fully familiar with. Uhm, we're

00:01:27.888,00:01:29.890
just gonna move on and we'll be
happy to follow up with you

00:01:29.890,00:01:32.960
afterwards as well. >> Yea, and
neither of us hide on the

00:01:32.960,00:01:35.562
internet - we're pretty
approachable, so don't be afraid

00:01:35.562,00:01:40.233
of us. So, introduction, I'm,
uh, Josh, "jduck" I go by on the

00:01:40.233,00:01:43.070
internet, that's how you find me
there. Uh, I've been doing VR

00:01:43.070,00:01:47.107
for 20 years and so this, this
20 years actually includes

00:01:47.107,00:01:50.811
several years as a hobbiest. Uh,
and at one point I ran the

00:01:50.811,00:01:53.580
iDefense Vulnerability
Contributor Program where we

00:01:53.580,00:01:56.049
would actually vulnerabilities
from researches and get them

00:01:56.049,00:01:58.885
fixed then coordinate and all
that stuff. So, that's, that'

00:01:58.885,00:02:01.221
how I met Steve and we, we did a
fair amount of work together at

00:02:01.221,00:02:05.225
that point. >> Yea. An we met
through the, uh, CVE programme

00:02:05.225,00:02:10.664
which I was a co-founder of and
led from 1999 until, uh, the end

00:02:10.664,00:02:12.966
of last year, basically. Uhm,
there's a thing called re,

00:02:12.966,00:02:16.970
responsible disclosure I am a
survivor of the responsible

00:02:16.970,00:02:21.174
disclosure wars. I now call them
coordinated disclosures, I

00:02:21.174,00:02:23.744
coined the responsible
disclosure term for which I will

00:02:23.744,00:02:26.480
be eternally sorry! [audience
noise] [laughing] But it served

00:02:26.480,00:02:30.050
its purpose. I started getting
into, uhm, classification of

00:02:30.050,00:02:34.121
vulnerabilities as well which is
where CWE comes from. And, uh, I

00:02:34.121,00:02:39.526
was also a participant in the
development of CVSS version 2.

00:02:39.526,00:02:41.928
>> Quick question, how many
people in here have a CVE to

00:02:41.928,00:02:47.668
their name? [pause] >> Alright,
let's fix that. That was like a

00:02:47.668,00:02:51.605
dozen I think. >> Yea.. >>
That's pretty good. So, uh, why

00:02:51.605,00:02:54.441
are we doing this? We want to
fix that, right? We want more

00:02:54.441,00:02:58.011
people out there doing research
into vulnerabilities, uh,

00:02:58.011,00:03:01.815
software and hardware into all
kinds of systems. Uh, cause as

00:03:01.815,00:03:05.285
we've seen there's lots of crazy
things possible. Uh, it was very

00:03:05.285,00:03:07.721
interesting to see the previous
talk - the guy hacked into a

00:03:07.721,00:03:12.025
loyalty program that's, uh,
that's good stuff. It's fun. So,

00:03:12.025,00:03:17.097
uhm, what else? >> We have this
little tiny picture on the slide

00:03:17.097,00:03:18.899
on here. It's like tiny. If
anyone works... >> You guys are

00:03:18.899,00:03:21.001
seeing the slides much better
than we do. >> Yea we're flying

00:03:21.001,00:03:23.637
a little bit blind. >> If
anybody works at Google Slides

00:03:23.637,00:03:25.872
you might need to work on this
thing. [audience noise] >> We

00:03:25.872,00:03:28.642
can, uh, we can move on. >>
Alright, yea, so just to get

00:03:28.642,00:03:32.012
people involved. So, disclaimer
up front, right? This is our

00:03:32.012,00:03:35.782
opinion, we've did lots of stuff
with vulns over the years - find

00:03:35.782,00:03:40.020
em', analyze 'em all that stuff.
And, uh, you know, we just

00:03:40.020,00:03:42.222
formulated these opinions, so,
they, they may not be right for

00:03:42.222,00:03:45.992
you. Uh, s... [pause] Take that
with a grain of salt and, and,

00:03:45.992,00:03:49.529
you know, remember that, that
you, you're your own person and

00:03:49.529,00:03:52.032
you gotta find your own path,
uh, we're just trying to help

00:03:52.032,00:03:56.136
you see some of the stuff. So...
[audience noise] Lastly, there's

00:03:56.136,00:03:58.438
no new exploits here so if you
came here for... Who came here

00:03:58.438,00:04:05.312
to see new exploits? [pause]
Okay, good, thank you. [chatter]

00:04:05.312,00:04:07.647
[pause] >> Okay, so first of all
there's a question about what is

00:04:07.647,00:04:09.950
a vulnerability in the first
place? And we'll start with what

00:04:09.950,00:04:13.487
a vulnerability is not. One of
the most commonly confused,uh,

00:04:13.487,00:04:16.957
terms is "Exploit" versus
"Vulnerability' and a lot of

00:04:16.957,00:04:19.626
people think that exploit and
vulnerability actually mean the

00:04:19.626,00:04:23.630
same thing. However, they don't.
An, an exploit is really a

00:04:23.630,00:04:26.199
sequence of steps that's used to
take advantage of a

00:04:26.199,00:04:29.402
vulnerability. A vulnerability
is a problem within the code

00:04:29.402,00:04:32.839
itself which is kinda, more or
less, uh, sits there, uh,

00:04:32.839,00:04:36.710
waiting to be, uh, waiting to be
exploited. These are almost

00:04:36.710,00:04:40.013
circular-sounding terms but,
uhm, face a number of

00:04:40.013,00:04:43.650
difficulties in actually really
defining these a little bit more

00:04:43.650,00:04:47.721
carefully. And I think that's a
reflection partially of, uhm,

00:04:47.721,00:04:50.924
the relative immaturity of the
vulnerability research, uh,

00:04:50.924,00:04:55.328
specialty. [pause] >> Yea, I
wish I could expand this picture

00:04:55.328,00:04:59.733
for you. But i think, what does
Taylor Swift say here? "To, to,

00:04:59.733,00:05:04.171
uh, to be loved is to be
vulnerable"... uh and... I got..

00:05:04.171,00:05:07.507
>> To love is to be vulnerable
and to be loved is the greatest

00:05:07.507,00:05:12.312
exploit... >> Greatest exploit,
right? >> Pretty good quote. So

00:05:12.312,00:05:14.881
we, we go back and forth on what
this definition of what is a

00:05:14.881,00:05:18.351
vulnerability? Uh, and, there's
so many different way to define

00:05:18.351,00:05:21.521
it, I think Steve did a great
job already saying it. Uh, one

00:05:21.521,00:05:23.557
of the biggest things really is
that you have some kind of

00:05:23.557,00:05:28.562
impact on a system. Uh, if, if,
uh, you don't have some kind of

00:05:28.562,00:05:31.064
impact and you're not changing
the way things working it's

00:05:31.064,00:05:34.234
pretty much not a vulnerability
but when, you know, Greg McManus

00:05:34.234,00:05:38.104
at iDefence taught me, uh, you
can, you know, through heavy

00:05:38.104,00:05:41.074
abuse of him asking me this
question I told him I thought I

00:05:41.074,00:05:43.977
found something, so he's like
"What do you have and what do

00:05:43.977,00:05:46.580
you get?" And, you know, for if
what you are getting from this

00:05:46.580,00:05:50.116
vulnerability if you manage to
exploit it, it's not better in

00:05:50.116,00:05:52.886
some way than what you started
with. Then you do not have a

00:05:52.886,00:05:55.322
vulnerability, it's uh, it's
more like a bug or something

00:05:55.322,00:05:58.325
really annoying. >> And this is
one of the common problems we

00:05:58.325,00:06:01.361
run across, with, uh, with new
researchers who try and report

00:06:01.361,00:06:03.363
CVEs or something like that.
[audience noise] [coughing] They

00:06:03.363,00:06:06.867
find something that may be a bug
or may actually be a feature but

00:06:06.867,00:06:10.103
it is something that is
legitimately already allowed or

00:06:10.103,00:06:13.273
somebody... or with the
privileges you already have you

00:06:13.273,00:06:17.010
can already go legitimately go
through some other route to, uh,

00:06:17.010,00:06:19.846
uh, uh, obtain those, uh,
additional capabilities. So

00:06:19.846,00:06:24.684
that's one particular point of
confusion. [pause] >> Yea, so,

00:06:24.684,00:06:26.686
uh, I mean, let me just state,
uh ano, another important point

00:06:26.686,00:06:29.422
to make about vulnerabilities
is, uh, as Steve knows with,

00:06:29.422,00:06:32.459
well, his classification work in
CWE that there are many many

00:06:32.459,00:06:34.995
properties of vulnerabilities,
one of the, like I mentioned

00:06:34.995,00:06:37.964
before, the impact is a really
important one. But, also, the

00:06:37.964,00:06:41.301
user act, the user interaction
is an interesting one. [ahem]

00:06:41.301,00:06:43.737
These things are used by the,
the, offensive side to

00:06:43.737,00:06:48.174
prioritise patching and
strategies around defense. So,

00:06:48.174,00:06:52.312
uhm, this is just a couple of
important properties. How long,

00:06:52.312,00:06:54.814
uh, another interesting one
these days which is getting more

00:06:54.814,00:06:57.484
and more interesting is "How
hard does this thing actually

00:06:57.484,00:06:59.753
need to exploit?". And I think,
you know, and as things have

00:06:59.753,00:07:02.188
improved over the years, it's
gotten [ahem] much harder to do

00:07:02.188,00:07:04.824
that. [audience noise] >> Yea
it's, it's become a lot more

00:07:04.824,00:07:08.528
difficult, uh, to do that and,
uh, that's, uh, thanks to the

00:07:08.528,00:07:11.598
defensive work in the, uh, build
up of many different types of

00:07:11.598,00:07:15.235
protection mechanisms, and so,
there's almost like a

00:07:15.235,00:07:17.737
"Heisenberg-ian", uh, approach
to interpreting vulnerabilities

00:07:17.737,00:07:19.072
these days. Uhm, uh, where
something was clearly

00:07:19.072,00:07:20.407
exploitable perhaps 10 years ago
it may wind up taking a whole

00:07:20.407,00:07:21.775
lot of work. That's one of the
great things about the defensive

00:07:21.775,00:07:23.109
side of understanding
vulnerabilities which is to

00:07:23.109,00:07:28.114
really build in these system,
systematic defenses. [pause] >>

00:07:38.291,00:07:40.760
I have a whole rant that we can
do on this some other time.

00:07:40.760,00:07:44.397
[audience noise] >> But we'll
save that for later. >> Yea. >>

00:07:44.397,00:07:47.267
Alright, and so then, finally we
get to what is the vulnerability

00:07:47.267,00:07:51.604
research, and, and, in this case
what we're saying is the process

00:07:51.604,00:07:57.744
of analyzing a product protocol
or algorithm. [pause] You guys

00:07:57.744,00:07:59.145
already read this one...
[chuckle] >> Work specification

00:07:59.145,00:08:03.650
to basically to, to try and find
vulnerabilities or understand

00:08:03.650,00:08:07.120
them. Uh, one or more
vulnerabilities basically. So,

00:08:07.120,00:08:10.156
there are different, uh, kind of
approaches different, uh,

00:08:10.156,00:08:13.560
different kinds of products or
specifications and so on that

00:08:13.560,00:08:17.497
you may decide to look at. It's
all, uh, more or less falls

00:08:17.497,00:08:19.899
under the umbrella-term of
"Vulnerability Research".

00:08:19.899,00:08:23.837
However, the term itself is,
uhm, treated and interpreted a

00:08:23.837,00:08:26.573
little bit differently. You
might sometimes hear the term

00:08:26.573,00:08:30.377
"vulnerability discovery" and
that's really intended by, used

00:08:30.377,00:08:33.847
by people who want to
distinguish from, let's say

00:08:33.847,00:08:38.551
academic strength research, uh,
versus going and doing bug

00:08:38.551,00:08:41.688
hunting. And so, on... and some
people use that term. That

00:08:41.688,00:08:45.125
distinction does wind up being
important, I think, sometimes.

00:08:45.125,00:08:48.495
Uh, but again, the terminology
is still kind of emerging and

00:08:48.495,00:08:51.398
you don't have a lot of
agreement. >> I'll again, when I

00:08:51.398,00:08:54.501
do an exploit here and I
personally think exploits and

00:08:54.501,00:08:57.170
exploit development and stuff
like that falls under VR... >>

00:08:57.170,00:09:01.641
As do I. >> Yea, but it's, uh,
it's not really our focus here

00:09:01.641,00:09:04.944
so let's keep going. >> It, it,
it's really about uhm, uh,

00:09:04.944,00:09:07.947
solving puzzles where you don't
even know what the puzzle is in

00:09:07.947,00:09:11.151
the first place. You don't even
know if you'll find a puzzle.

00:09:11.151,00:09:13.953
Then maybe you find a puzzle
which lead you to other puzzles

00:09:13.953,00:09:17.424
in some way. That's one of the
big attractions to me, for, uhm,

00:09:17.424,00:09:21.027
vulnerability research. [pause]
>> Alright, so why do it? Uh,

00:09:21.027,00:09:22.962
you know, if you, incase you're
very new and you're just

00:09:22.962,00:09:25.465
curious. Here is some reasons
why you might wanna get

00:09:25.465,00:09:27.967
motivated to do the hard work
which is vulnerability research.

00:09:27.967,00:09:32.972
Uh, I can't really see the
slide. [chuckle] [pause] Hooray

00:09:35.041,00:09:37.844
Google Slides... >> I'm serious,
it's so tiny! The speaker notes

00:09:37.844,00:09:39.179
are the whole screen and the
slide is like... a little tiny

00:09:39.179,00:09:40.914
square. >> Hope there aren't any
Google people in the room,

00:09:40.914,00:09:42.282
but... >> I hope there are so
they'll fix this stuff.

00:09:42.282,00:09:47.287
[laughter] [pause] [chuckle] So
then, what are the big points to

00:09:53.493,00:09:56.729
note here as you look at this,
uh, nice little word cloud is,

00:09:56.729,00:10:00.767
uh, go ahead... >> Ah! That's
okay. Let's just go the next

00:10:00.767,00:10:03.369
slide. >> Yea. [chuckle]
[laughter] The, the main

00:10:03.369,00:10:06.940
takeaway from the previous slide
is that uh, there are many

00:10:06.940,00:10:09.742
different motivations, that many
different researchers have and

00:10:09.742,00:10:12.946
your motivations may not be the
same as others. And in addition

00:10:12.946,00:10:16.015
when you're dealing with vendors
- vendors may only have

00:10:16.015,00:10:18.651
experienced or they may only
assume certain kinds of

00:10:18.651,00:10:22.956
motivations from you. And so
that potentially causes, uh, uh,

00:10:22.956,00:10:27.360
certain difficulties when
interacting with vendors.

00:10:27.360,00:10:30.163
[pause] >> I personally like
just about all these words one

00:10:30.163,00:10:35.869
here. Uhm... I dunno. So there's
a lot of different careers.

00:10:35.869,00:10:38.171
Steve, you wanna talk to them?
>> Yea, so, uhm, there's a

00:10:38.171,00:10:41.341
number of different careers but
it's not like, uhm, you know,

00:10:41.341,00:10:44.811
uh, a career shop that you can
go to this is still a new field,

00:10:44.811,00:10:48.481
uhm, in my way of thinking we're
like, kind of entering the

00:10:48.481,00:10:51.384
second generation, we're sort of
the first generation. >> We're

00:10:51.384,00:10:55.355
s... [deep breath] We're trying
not to skip one. >> We're...

00:10:55.355,00:10:58.224
[chuckle] And it's really good
to see a full room here actually

00:10:58.224,00:11:00.994
because we need a lot more
people doing vulnerability

00:11:00.994,00:11:04.230
research cause we've only, you
know, seen the tip of the

00:11:04.230,00:11:08.201
iceberg. But, what's called
vulnerability research, uh, it

00:11:08.201,00:11:10.436
may vary but there's a lot of
different things that one can

00:11:10.436,00:11:13.706
do. Yes you can go and you can
hunt bugs and you can hunt

00:11:13.706,00:11:16.342
vulnerabilities. Other people
may really like building up

00:11:16.342,00:11:19.279
exploits against those
vulnerabilities. And I agree

00:11:19.279,00:11:21.981
with Josh that, uh, that's an
aspect of vulnerability

00:11:21.981,00:11:24.784
research. Then there's other
stuff that maybe a bit more

00:11:24.784,00:11:28.054
adjacent to vulnerabilities that
still involves a lot of analysis

00:11:28.054,00:11:31.257
so... I previously mentioned
things like building defensive

00:11:31.257,00:11:34.093
protection mechanisms to help
prev, to help protect against

00:11:34.093,00:11:38.097
entire classes of
vulnerabilities. Uhm, you know,

00:11:38.097,00:11:42.101
for CVE a lot what we did was
to, uhm, catalog those

00:11:42.101,00:11:45.572
vulnerabilities and in a way try
and figure out how the CVE

00:11:45.572,00:11:49.042
identifier could be used to help
people to coordinate. [audience

00:11:49.042,00:11:53.179
coughing] And so on... uhm, and
it, and another option is to,

00:11:53.179,00:11:57.150
uh, really work on fixing them,
uh, you could be working at a, a

00:11:57.150,00:12:00.153
developer somewhere and, uh, see
a vulnerability that's been

00:12:00.153,00:12:04.257
reported, and figure out how to
actually fix the code. And, I

00:12:04.257,00:12:07.961
guess one, one note that just,
just just popped into my mind

00:12:07.961,00:12:10.897
here is that there are a lot of
vulnerability researchers who

00:12:10.897,00:12:14.200
discover vulnerabilities would
have no idea actually how to fix

00:12:14.200,00:12:16.869
them. It's a completely
different mindset, you have to

00:12:16.869,00:12:20.406
have, you can have a really,
uhm, solid development

00:12:20.406,00:12:23.243
background - you need a solid
development background - to

00:12:23.243,00:12:26.879
build a good fix. But, that's
not necessarily, uhm, the kind

00:12:26.879,00:12:30.483
of skill you need to do
vulnerability research. [pause]

00:12:30.483,00:12:34.153
>> Yea, that's right, uh, one
thing I will add is that if you

00:12:34.153,00:12:37.457
do start doing this stuff or
find a job doing this stuff you

00:12:37.457,00:12:40.126
basically have unlimited
obscurity. [ahem] [audience

00:12:40.126,00:12:42.762
noise] For the, for the
foreseeable future... >> So

00:12:42.762,00:12:45.098
there's a lot of different
employers that, you know, you

00:12:45.098,00:12:47.867
basically could have, uhm. I
mention you know, uhm, you could

00:12:47.867,00:12:50.637
work at a software vendor, you
could work for a government

00:12:50.637,00:12:53.673
organisation or CIRT
coordinator. You could work at

00:12:53.673,00:12:57.043
a, a commercial enterprise where
they develop security products

00:12:57.043,00:13:01.114
or whether is it does consulting
services. Uhm, however, these

00:13:01.114,00:13:04.817
days pretty much every business
that's out there is more or less

00:13:04.817,00:13:07.987
a software developer. Think
about Target, think about other

00:13:07.987,00:13:11.891
kinds of brick-and-mortar, uh,
you know, companies. Those all

00:13:11.891,00:13:15.595
develop software either in-house
to help them manage their

00:13:15.595,00:13:19.499
operations or externally in
respect to websites and so on.

00:13:19.499,00:13:23.569
And, as you all have probably
heard there is a huge demand and

00:13:23.569,00:13:27.540
so these are some of the options
that you, uh, that you could

00:13:27.540,00:13:30.943
look at and you would be most
likely welcomed with open arms

00:13:30.943,00:13:34.047
by someone somewhere. Because we
need a lot more researches. >>

00:13:34.047,00:13:37.650
I, uh, I'm a little bit partial
to the bounty programs to really

00:13:37.650,00:13:41.754
find them. And, uh, uh, if you
have a good employer, like I'm

00:13:41.754,00:13:45.725
fortunate enough to do, and you
can have bonus money and throw

00:13:45.725,00:13:50.296
parties at BSides and stuff like
that... [laughter] Cheers!

00:13:50.296,00:13:55.768
[laughter] Yea, so let's do the
next one. >> Uh, so, uh, these

00:13:55.768,00:13:58.337
next couple slides is really
just kinda, uhm, a little bit

00:13:58.337,00:14:00.606
more like a disclaimer than
normal in terms of our opinion

00:14:00.606,00:14:03.876
but based on our personal
experiences and, I've actually

00:14:03.876,00:14:06.846
done some vulnerability research
myself, it was awhile ago. But

00:14:06.846,00:14:09.749
based on our personal
experiences and interacting with

00:14:09.749,00:14:13.686
other researchers, uh, there are
a number of personality traits

00:14:13.686,00:14:17.256
that generally seem to be...
useful for longer term success

00:14:17.256,00:14:20.493
within, uh, within vulnerability
research. So, for example, a

00:14:20.493,00:14:23.362
willingness to work, uh,
independently, a willingness to

00:14:23.362,00:14:26.966
learn. Uh, being very, uh, uh,
critical thinking, you always

00:14:26.966,00:14:31.270
have to be more or less question
your own assumptions. >> That's

00:14:31.270,00:14:35.942
a good point, I don't even think
that's in the slides but that's

00:14:35.942,00:14:40.379
a really good point. >> And, uh,
really it's... It's primarily a

00:14:40.379,00:14:45.251
solitary effort, you need to be,
you need to diligent, uhm, and,

00:14:45.251,00:14:50.656
uh, you see some of the other
features there basically. But

00:14:50.656,00:14:53.659
two of the biggest personality
traits that we believe are

00:14:53.659,00:14:57.396
important are "Patience" and
"Persistence". Patience is

00:14:57.396,00:15:01.367
essential not only with yourself
and the process of discovering

00:15:01.367,00:15:04.437
and investigating these
vulnerabilities but patience

00:15:04.437,00:15:06.739
when dealing with others.
Especially when dealing with,

00:15:06.739,00:15:10.610
say, vendors that might not
necessarily behaving exactly the

00:15:10.610,00:15:12.779
way you would want to when
you're, uh, trying to

00:15:12.779,00:15:16.816
communicate with them. [pause]
So those were some of the

00:15:16.816,00:15:18.785
"should have" personality
traits, these are some of the

00:15:18.785,00:15:21.921
ones that we think are nice to
have, sti, still a greater

00:15:21.921,00:15:26.125
formula for success here. To
really be able to be focussed,

00:15:26.125,00:15:30.930
to, uhm, to seek to improve
software, which is, uh, a common

00:15:30.930,00:15:34.133
thing. The ability to
collaborate whether that's uh,

00:15:34.133,00:15:38.137
to collaborate and work with
other people is something that

00:15:38.137,00:15:42.208
we believe is important. There
is, there can be many rock stars

00:15:42.208,00:15:46.279
and not so rock stars that don't
work well with other people.

00:15:46.279,00:15:49.649
Uhm, but that often times,
especially if you're just

00:15:49.649,00:15:54.187
starting out I think is probably
a career limiting, uh, uhm, kind

00:15:54.187,00:15:58.791
of attitude that one would take.
And we also have here a notion

00:15:58.791,00:16:02.595
of having, kind of, an addictive
personality. So for example at

00:16:02.595,00:16:08.801
CVE, you know, I stayed at CVE
for 16 years through 70-thousand

00:16:08.801,00:16:11.437
vulnerabilities. Now I didn't
investigate and look at all of

00:16:11.437,00:16:14.507
them but you could say that that
might be kind of indicative of

00:16:14.507,00:16:17.476
an addictive sort of
personality. And, Josh, you

00:16:17.476,00:16:20.012
know, how many weeks, or days,
or months have you spent on,

00:16:20.012,00:16:23.683
let's say, a single bug? [pause]
>> Uh, I dunno, the Stagefright

00:16:23.683,00:16:28.287
has been going for a long time.
[chuckle] I think maybe one

00:16:28.287,00:16:31.691
year... [audience noise] But,
uhm, yeah, it's not all at the

00:16:31.691,00:16:35.261
same time so... >> So, you know,
none of the personality traits

00:16:35.261,00:16:38.397
that we're talking about is
absolutely essential. Each of

00:16:38.397,00:16:41.834
you will find your own path. But
if you feel that you have some

00:16:41.834,00:16:44.704
of these personality traits then
you might find vulnerability

00:16:44.704,00:16:48.507
research enjoyable. >> So I
think we're going to be totally

00:16:48.507,00:16:51.177
screwed on this slide, because
it's small and all of them...

00:16:51.177,00:16:52.545
[laughter] >> So, we have a
number of different... >> You

00:16:52.545,00:16:54.580
can probably read it fine. >>
Yea. >> We can't read it at all.

00:16:54.580,00:16:56.949
>> We have a number of different
skills that we sorta listed here

00:16:56.949,00:17:00.519
for long term success but I
would say, probably that, uhm,

00:17:00.519,00:17:03.389
some of the, some of the biggest
ones - one is about analysis

00:17:03.389,00:17:06.826
tools, and, and findings so...
[audience noise] >> Not this

00:17:06.826,00:17:11.097
one, is it? >> Yip... We can
skip it on the next one too. >>

00:17:11.097,00:17:13.633
Alright... I think on the big
one we wanna say about

00:17:13.633,00:17:17.670
communication. I think we made
that pretty clear. [laughter] >>

00:17:17.670,00:17:22.441
Uh, yea. [pause] >> Alright, so
here's another awesome text

00:17:22.441,00:17:25.344
slide that we put together. And
we don't wanna read it to you

00:17:25.344,00:17:27.813
but, uhm, these are some of the
key terms that we feel on

00:17:27.813,00:17:30.283
vulnerability research of course
the slides will be available.

00:17:30.283,00:17:33.853
Uhm, you know, if you, if you
hear us, you probably already

00:17:33.853,00:17:37.189
heard us use, like, some of
these terms. But when it really

00:17:37.189,00:17:39.992
comes into doing analysis and
deeper research like, like some

00:17:39.992,00:17:43.596
of the stuff like root cause
analysis, uh, and vulnerability

00:17:43.596,00:17:46.465
chains and classes and
especially proof of concept

00:17:46.465,00:17:49.802
code, uh, become more important.
>> Uh, I think, uh, that one of

00:17:49.802,00:17:53.673
the key terms here, uh, uhm, I
guess we touch on it a little

00:17:53.673,00:17:57.376
bit later as well though is the
notion of root cause analysis.

00:17:57.376,00:18:00.646
This is where diligence and
critical thinking comes, comes

00:18:00.646,00:18:03.582
into play. You might discover
something that's like symptom of

00:18:03.582,00:18:07.987
a problem. Uh, and, and it's
really when you become tenacious

00:18:07.987,00:18:12.892
and dig deeper into it to find
out what's really causing the

00:18:12.892,00:18:17.830
problem in the first place. Uh,
where, uh, you may find, uh,

00:18:17.830,00:18:20.266
some significant success.
[pause] >> Alright, so,uh, in

00:18:20.266,00:18:22.835
the industry many of you
probably if you're interested in

00:18:22.835,00:18:25.237
vulnerability research already.
[audience noise] Uh... know

00:18:25.237,00:18:28.541
about this thing we call a
"Firehose" and that's basically

00:18:28.541,00:18:30.843
just a steady stream of
information about

00:18:30.843,00:18:33.646
vulnerabilities that's coming
from all angles. Uh, it includes

00:18:33.646,00:18:37.683
stuff like, some of my favourite
stuff like CTFs and wargames.

00:18:37.683,00:18:40.319
[ahem] Where you can learn...
[ahem] Excuse me... At your own

00:18:40.319,00:18:44.824
pace. Uh, uh, and just lots of
aggregation and other places. If

00:18:44.824,00:18:47.593
you wanna learn more about vulns
look at these things for sure.

00:18:47.593,00:18:50.696
>> There are a couple items that
are not on that, uh, not on that

00:18:50.696,00:18:53.366
list there that I think came,
came up during this week. And..

00:18:53.366,00:18:55.868
>> Oh yea? >> Uh, one of them
actually is the pwnie awards.

00:18:55.868,00:18:59.572
Because the pwnies awards often
talk about, you know, individual

00:18:59.572,00:19:03.109
bugs and typically those
additional bugs have additional

00:19:03.109,00:19:06.145
details. [audience noise] And
then another area is uh, bug

00:19:06.145,00:19:09.682
bounty programs which, uh, can
help you... >> Interact with a

00:19:09.682,00:19:12.818
lot of other stuff. >> And
interact with other. >> Yea. >>

00:19:12.818,00:19:16.288
Yea. Uh, actually, by a show of
hands how many people are in, or

00:19:16.288,00:19:19.025
have participated in bug-bounty
programs? And have gotten some

00:19:19.025,00:19:23.095
type of reward? >> Why is...
is.. >> Wow! >> Well this is

00:19:23.095,00:19:26.766
much better then how many people
have seen these... [chuckle]

00:19:26.766,00:19:28.100
[laughter] [pause] >> Okay,
moving on... >> But I guess

00:19:28.100,00:19:33.939
there is that rule about CB
using websites and... >> So,

00:19:33.939,00:19:36.642
uhm... wow! Go over and stare
really.... [laughter] So,

00:19:36.642,00:19:40.312
selecting your target, uh,
there's a lot of choices if you

00:19:40.312,00:19:43.082
wanna find bugs somewhere and
this is kind on the

00:19:43.082,00:19:47.420
vulnerability discovery side.
Uh, you know, you can go deep or

00:19:47.420,00:19:50.356
you can go broad and what we
mean by that is... You can pick

00:19:50.356,00:19:52.525
one particular type of
vulnerability or something and

00:19:52.525,00:19:55.161
go look at every software you
can find to see if it's

00:19:55.161,00:19:58.397
vulnerable or you could pick one
particular software and just

00:19:58.397,00:20:01.434
drill down until you find
something. [pause] >> There is a

00:20:01.434,00:20:04.770
lot of software that has more or
less low-hanging fruit. And...

00:20:04.770,00:20:08.107
if you wanna expand on that a
little? >> I will, I dunno if

00:20:08.107,00:20:12.111
it's on the slide or the next
one. [chuckle] So, uh, hey,

00:20:12.111,00:20:14.780
another big point I wanted to
make here is if you, if you do

00:20:14.780,00:20:16.816
do some vulnerability research
and you find nothing. It's

00:20:16.816,00:20:19.385
actually quite useful for people
to know that somebody actually

00:20:19.385,00:20:21.887
looked. Even if you found
nothing. So, that, that's one

00:20:21.887,00:20:25.257
point. Uh, and then again,
low-hanging fruit a lot of older

00:20:25.257,00:20:29.228
code is buggy, uh, complex or
overly complex stuff, is, uh,

00:20:29.228,00:20:31.831
very interesting to look at.
Although, you know, a lot of

00:20:31.831,00:20:34.233
times you just get lost and it
just like the developer did...

00:20:36.502,00:20:38.904
[laughter] Uh, large attack
surfaces like web browsers are

00:20:38.904,00:20:41.774
always fun to play with, you got
a lot of possibility for things

00:20:41.774,00:20:46.712
to go wrong there. So software
popularity matters, so if you're

00:20:46.712,00:20:49.648
gonna try and become super
famous and you wanna go find

00:20:49.648,00:20:51.851
some vuln in something it's
probably better to not pick

00:20:51.851,00:20:56.255
some, uh, random, uh, personal
website project off of Source

00:20:56.255,00:21:00.726
Forge or something like that.
Uh, but on the other hand if you

00:21:00.726,00:21:03.295
wanna find something in, you
know, a super popular product

00:21:03.295,00:21:06.799
like Microsoft Windows server
it's probably gonna not be

00:21:06.799,00:21:10.269
anywhere near as easy. [audience
noise] >> Not saying that

00:21:10.269,00:21:13.873
anywhere is easy because that
software, if the really popular

00:21:13.873,00:21:17.176
software is already been pounded
on and pounded on by many

00:21:17.176,00:21:19.979
people, by elite researchers and
so one. And so, the

00:21:19.979,00:21:22.481
lower-hanging fruit, the kind of
software that doesn't

00:21:22.481,00:21:27.319
necessarily have any
vulnerability history at all,

00:21:27.319,00:21:30.489
uh, or that no one's really
looked at before, uh, that's

00:21:30.489,00:21:33.959
often in your area where you can
find some success, uh, fairly

00:21:33.959,00:21:37.830
quickly. >> Yea, I dunno if, uh,
if it, you know, the one thing

00:21:37.830,00:21:40.900
that I like to do sometimes when
I get super stuck, uh, is to go

00:21:40.900,00:21:44.336
and pick on somebody lame... Uh,
I think this is kind of popular

00:21:44.336,00:21:47.072
in the VR industry where we just
need that redemption.. [audience

00:21:47.072,00:21:49.675
noise] Where we feel good about
ourselves again... [laughter]

00:21:49.675,00:21:52.311
Uh, but the problem with that
is, you know, like, uh, a good

00:21:52.311,00:21:54.680
example of that is OpenOffice or
something, it's, it's pretty

00:21:54.680,00:21:57.249
easy to fuzz that and it's full
of bugs and nobody really cares

00:21:57.249,00:22:00.986
about them too much. [laughter]
And so, uhm, you can go find

00:22:00.986,00:22:03.556
bugs there but then you deal
with the secondary problem cause

00:22:03.556,00:22:09.361
nobody's caring too much, so...
[chatter] Uh... So brand new

00:22:09.361,00:22:12.798
emerging technologies is always
a great place to look, uh, many

00:22:12.798,00:22:16.335
people in vuln research like to
wait until a thing becomes very

00:22:16.335,00:22:19.438
popular and therefore when
things are emerging nobody's

00:22:19.438,00:22:22.141
really paying attention. Uhm, I
think we can say that about

00:22:22.141,00:22:25.611
IPB6, I think there's maybe a
handful of IPB6 researchers

00:22:25.611,00:22:29.582
around, uh, even though that's
sort of slowly becoming a norm.

00:22:29.582,00:22:33.819
Let's see, Mobile or iOT are
definitely guilty of this

00:22:33.819,00:22:37.957
because, as they try to hurry up
and get to market really fast

00:22:37.957,00:22:41.193
they didn't invest in the
security and well, we're hoping

00:22:41.193,00:22:45.364
that we don't repeat that
mistake with iOT, but we'll see.

00:22:45.364,00:22:48.567
[pause] >> One suggestion we do
have which would be, uhm very

00:22:48.567,00:22:51.770
useful for the, uh, for the
entire community and for

00:22:51.770,00:22:54.974
contributing to the body of
knowledge is that you have

00:22:54.974,00:22:58.510
access to software or products
that are, uh, very difficult for

00:22:58.510,00:23:02.181
the everyday person to get
access to. Say, you know,

00:23:02.181,00:23:06.652
multi-million dollar enterprise
software, or, uh, expensive

00:23:06.652,00:23:10.789
medical devices or other kind of
physical devices, uhm, you know,

00:23:10.789,00:23:13.826
those aren't things that just
everybody can go and grab and

00:23:13.826,00:23:15.194
look at. So, not only might you
have some good chances of uh,

00:23:15.194,00:23:16.528
success in finding
vulnerabilities in those kind of

00:23:16.528,00:23:17.863
products. Not a lot of people
have access. [pause] >> Who

00:23:17.863,00:23:19.531
knows how to do that, like,
[coughing] magnifying glass

00:23:19.531,00:23:24.536
thing on OSX? Anyone? [pause]
Nobody? You want coffee or

00:23:30.109,00:23:34.546
something? [pause] Well I'll
just stare at it really small

00:23:34.546,00:23:38.817
again. So we got that oooooon...
[pause] [coughing] So, uh, uh,

00:23:38.817,00:23:42.922
some of it, and I've seen a lot,
and, and Steve kinda coined the

00:23:42.922,00:23:46.859
term and it's "Pigpile effect".
It's pretty interesting, that's

00:23:46.859,00:23:50.095
when we select a target, you
see, uh people beating up on

00:23:50.095,00:23:52.197
something, three advisors
getting published and you're

00:23:52.197,00:23:54.233
like "Well, hey, maybe I feel
like there's, there might be

00:23:54.233,00:23:56.735
more there, I should maybe go
take a look there, maybe do some

00:23:56.735,00:24:00.139
pile on work." Uh, I encourage
the community to put this one on

00:24:00.139,00:24:02.408
Stagefright heavily. [coughing]
I think it's good to have more

00:24:02.408,00:24:07.713
people looking. [sniff] So,
tools and techniques, uhm,

00:24:07.713,00:24:10.816
there's kind of, like a, these
two main one which are really

00:24:10.816,00:24:14.953
kinda high-level: design review,
uh, and threat modelling. These

00:24:14.953,00:24:18.490
are, I think, really important
for anyone who's developing

00:24:18.490,00:24:22.828
software, uh, to have this as
part of like the cycle of

00:24:22.828,00:24:27.066
figuring out how to, how to, to
stay secure, or how to basically

00:24:27.066,00:24:31.236
stop having alarm bells ringing
all the time. Uh, dynamic or

00:24:31.236,00:24:34.406
static analysis is, is very
important to differentiate,

00:24:34.406,00:24:37.309
depending on what kind of stuff
you're gonna do. Uhm, like, on

00:24:37.309,00:24:40.346
the malware side static analysis
software is a lot more popular.

00:24:40.346,00:24:42.348
With vulnerability research
allows a lot more dynamic

00:24:42.348,00:24:45.284
analyses seems to be more
popular. But I think the real

00:24:45.284,00:24:48.987
power here is when you have both
together. One, one of my

00:24:48.987,00:24:52.891
personal bug-hunting processes
is to, to start writing a fuzzer

00:24:52.891,00:24:55.561
and just let it run while I read
the code and as soon as I learnt

00:24:55.561,00:24:57.529
something more about the code
that will help the fuzzer be

00:24:57.529,00:24:59.798
good and I'll add it to the
fuzzer. [coughing] I just keep

00:24:59.798,00:25:05.237
doing that back and forth.
[pause] Uh, so code auditing and

00:25:05.237,00:25:08.907
some of these other automated
tools, like, uh static code

00:25:08.907,00:25:11.877
analysis, analyzers, they're
great but a lot of times they

00:25:11.877,00:25:16.482
have false positives or they
other issues, and so, uh, it's

00:25:16.482,00:25:19.518
just important to be aware of
the tradeoffs of kind of all of

00:25:19.518,00:25:22.588
the tools and techniques when
you start getting into them. I,

00:25:22.588,00:25:26.525
I really think that a tool in
this industry is the embodiment

00:25:26.525,00:25:30.195
of the technique that someone
developed to a large degree.

00:25:30.195,00:25:32.898
[coughing] >> Yea, and I agree
with that and... [ahem] While we

00:25:32.898,00:25:36.068
have a number of tools and
techniques listed here, uhm, you

00:25:36.068,00:25:38.704
know, that doesn't mean that you
have to know all of them and be

00:25:38.704,00:25:41.707
an expert in all of them in
order to find any kind of

00:25:41.707,00:25:45.444
success this is part of your
path, uh, but we do recommend,

00:25:45.444,00:25:48.580
as I say, to investigators to at
least investigate and, uh, look

00:25:48.580,00:25:51.650
into each of these. Everyone's
kinda has their own sort of

00:25:51.650,00:25:57.656
favorite techniques that they
like to do. [pause] >> This

00:25:57.656,00:26:02.761
one's you man... >> So as the
field becomes, uh, a little bit

00:26:02.761,00:26:07.800
more mature and, uh, ties in
obviously with vulnerability

00:26:07.800,00:26:11.136
management over all. There's a
number of relevant standards

00:26:11.136,00:26:13.972
that you should familiarize
yourself with and uh, and

00:26:13.972,00:26:18.811
utilize wherever you can. Uh,
one of the main ones is the

00:26:18.811,00:26:21.213
common ident... uh,
identification scheme for

00:26:21.213,00:26:24.850
vulnerability is called CVE and,
uhm, and for those of you

00:26:24.850,00:26:29.621
who've, uh, uh, who've had
certain questions about CVE

00:26:29.621,00:26:33.325
especially, uh, in the last year
or so with concerns about

00:26:33.325,00:26:38.130
coverage and what MITRE is
doing. While I did leave CVE,

00:26:38.130,00:26:42.100
uhm, last year, I am still at
MITRE and we do have one of my

00:26:42.100,00:26:46.405
colleagues here who, uh, uh,
carrying the torch as it were

00:26:46.405,00:26:48.040
and wanted to talk to you. And
so... [audience noise] I wanted

00:26:48.040,00:26:53.846
him to stand up here. That's
Stan... [applause] He will be...

00:26:53.846,00:26:59.084
[applause] >> Hey Stan... >>
Hey. >> We need to talk, buddy.

00:26:59.084,00:27:01.753
[pause] So, uh, he will be
available and he would, uh, he

00:27:01.753,00:27:04.957
would love to, love to talk to
you. Uhm, not all of you at

00:27:04.957,00:27:09.895
once, but, uh, you know... A few
at a, a few at a time. [audience

00:27:09.895,00:27:12.731
noise] Uh... [chuckle] Another
effort is the common weakness in

00:27:12.731,00:27:17.169
remuneration. And this, uh, uh,
uh, when you have these

00:27:17.169,00:27:19.571
different vulnerabilities in
different products. Well it

00:27:19.571,00:27:23.242
turns out that programmers make
the same mistakes and many

00:27:23.242,00:27:27.079
different programmers make the
same mistakes. And, so, CWE is

00:27:27.079,00:27:31.717
essentially, effectively a
classification scheme for, uhm,

00:27:31.717,00:27:36.021
how programmers wind up making
these kind of mistakes. Uh,

00:27:36.021,00:27:38.590
it's, uh, useful in two
different ways - one as sort of

00:27:38.590,00:27:42.861
a common identifier for, uhm,
characterizing what the mistake

00:27:42.861,00:27:47.466
is that you found but it also
winds up being very useful as a

00:27:47.466,00:27:52.104
dictionary or as, uh, something
to educate you. So for example

00:27:52.104,00:27:56.041
CWE covers 800 different, 800
different kinds of mistakes that

00:27:56.041,00:28:00.078
programmers can make and as much
as you think you may know about

00:28:00.078,00:28:03.215
everything, I guarantee you that
there's one or two things in

00:28:03.215,00:28:05.450
there that might surprise you or
that you might not have

00:28:05.450,00:28:09.922
expected. And if you are just
starting out you get good, you

00:28:09.922,00:28:14.192
get good information from things
such as OWASP but CWE is as well

00:28:14.192,00:28:18.530
for stuff like SQL injection and
cross-site scripting is also

00:28:18.530,00:28:25.470
pretty mature. Uh, equivalent
for uhm a task is called CAPEC.

00:28:25.470,00:28:30.509
Uh, and then CVSS is a way of
being able to consistently

00:28:30.509,00:28:34.580
applies a risk-related score to
a particular vulnerability that

00:28:34.580,00:28:37.916
you've found. So, it may be your
favorite vulnerability, you

00:28:37.916,00:28:41.153
might be in love with it, you
might have worked really hard uh

00:28:41.153,00:28:45.891
but you need the cold objective,
reasonably objective eye of CVSS

00:28:45.891,00:28:49.628
or something like that so you
can communicate its importance,

00:28:49.628,00:28:55.100
uh, uh, effectively. >> Thank
youuuu. Hey sorry about messing

00:28:55.100,00:28:56.969
with the slides, I was trying to
zoom in on this little tiny

00:28:56.969,00:28:59.938
thing and it zoomed
everything... So that doesn't

00:28:59.938,00:29:03.909
work. [pause] >> Uh, so, uh,
disclosure models. Disclosure,

00:29:03.909,00:29:07.212
disclosure, disclosure... There,
we're not gonna go into specific

00:29:07.212,00:29:09.948
details but there a number of
different models, that, uh, you

00:29:09.948,00:29:13.852
can consider and more or less
figure out more or less what

00:29:13.852,00:29:17.422
works for you. Uhm, I do and I
think Josh agrees that we both

00:29:17.422,00:29:19.758
suggest using the coordinated
disclosure model, which involves

00:29:19.758,00:29:23.762
really, uh, working with the,
the, the vendor in order to try

00:29:23.762,00:29:26.898
and reach some resolution but
there are other models as well

00:29:26.898,00:29:30.369
such as full disclosure. As soon
as you find it you sort of put

00:29:30.369,00:29:33.171
it out independent of whether or
not the vendor's been given a

00:29:33.171,00:29:36.008
chance to patch. And then
there's also non-disclosures

00:29:36.008,00:29:38.143
some people may simply choose
not to disclose the

00:29:38.143,00:29:40.679
vulnerabilities or, uh, to only,
uh, provide them or, uh, in some

00:29:40.679,00:29:43.882
cases sell them, in uh, limited
markets. But this is, this,

00:29:43.882,00:29:48.286
these are different things that
you're gonna need to consider as

00:29:48.286,00:29:52.791
you move more into vulnerability
research. You may have any

00:29:52.791,00:29:56.828
number of different, uhm,
approaches and believes in, in

00:29:56.828,00:30:02.000
why it's important to, uh public
disclosure. Uh, but I think the

00:30:02.000,00:30:07.005
more we know the better we know
all of us collectively. And

00:30:07.005,00:30:10.175
finally there are a couple
different standards or

00:30:10.175,00:30:13.812
standards-like documents that,
uhm, will give you some guidance

00:30:13.812,00:30:16.148
in respect to coordinated
disclosure or equivalent models,

00:30:16.148,00:30:19.384
uh, that you can follow or
provide advice to vendors who

00:30:19.384,00:30:22.354
may not be used to handling
vulnerabilities. Most

00:30:22.354,00:30:27.359
importantly is international
standards organisation - ISO,

00:30:31.663,00:30:35.400
uh, document number 2 9 1 4 7
which was done by, uh, Katie

00:30:35.400,00:30:38.970
Moussouris and others.
International standard - it is

00:30:38.970,00:30:42.708
something that is directed
towards vendors which explains

00:30:42.708,00:30:47.779
to them how to, uh, build up a
process for responding to

00:30:47.779,00:30:51.316
vulnerability reports and for
interacting with, uh, the

00:30:51.316,00:30:55.987
researchers. So, uhm, as a
survivor of the disclosure wars,

00:30:55.987,00:31:00.692
uh, I'm very very happy to see
standards like that 2 9 1 4 7 to

00:31:00.692,00:31:03.862
come out. And yes, it did take
me 6 months before I could start

00:31:03.862,00:31:10.268
rattling that number. [laughter]
[pause] >> If you start to get

00:31:10.268,00:31:15.240
deeper into, uhm, uh, building
your vulnerability career so to

00:31:15.240,00:31:17.476
speak then you may have
different kind of, uh,

00:31:17.476,00:31:21.246
considerations for building your
own kind of public, your own

00:31:21.246,00:31:26.585
disclosure policy. Based on your
own experiences and your own

00:31:26.585,00:31:29.755
believes you, you, want to start
evolving certain kind of

00:31:29.755,00:31:33.125
considerations for what you're
gonna do in certain kinds of

00:31:33.125,00:31:36.661
circumstances. So, what you
think, what would you do if you

00:31:36.661,00:31:39.664
try and contact a vendor and you
can find any contact

00:31:39.664,00:31:43.535
information? Or what happens if
you're working through a process

00:31:43.535,00:31:46.538
and then suddenly the, uh,
vulnerability is released by

00:31:46.538,00:31:50.809
somebody else as "zero day" or
something like that. [audience

00:31:50.809,00:31:53.812
noise] There's a lot of debate
about, uh, how long do I

00:31:53.812,00:31:57.182
actually give the vendor before
they fix the vulnerability and

00:31:57.182,00:32:00.886
push it out, uh, push out a
patch? Some say 30 days, some

00:32:00.886,00:32:06.158
say 60 days, there's 90 days or
however long it takes. These are

00:32:06.158,00:32:11.196
some of the questions you need
to ask yourself. [pause] Yea...

00:32:11.196,00:32:15.667
[pause] What... >> That's a...
>> I had a point. I forgot what

00:32:15.667,00:32:18.370
it was though. >> Let's skip
this one. >> Oh, I think, I

00:32:18.370,00:32:21.640
think I was just gonna say that
sometimes the disclosure process

00:32:21.640,00:32:25.577
you choose will even vary do,
you know, based on the

00:32:25.577,00:32:29.447
individual vulnerabilities. Some
people decide not to disclose

00:32:29.447,00:32:34.452
things that are not super
awesome. [laughter] [pause] >>

00:32:34.452,00:32:37.622
Alright, so, uh, we got 10
minutes, we lost a little to the

00:32:37.622,00:32:40.792
technical... >> Yea... >>
Difficulties, so, let's... We're

00:32:40.792,00:32:44.462
gonna move on, I think. >> Skip
down. >> Yup.. alright so let's

00:32:44.462,00:32:46.731
talk a little bit about advisory
structure and content. I'm

00:32:46.731,00:32:49.067
totally not gonna read these
bullets to you. [laughter] But,

00:32:49.067,00:32:53.772
like, uhm, structured content
is, is very useful. I think

00:32:53.772,00:32:56.141
Steve and I collectively, well
we probably read a lot of the

00:32:56.141,00:32:59.077
same advisories but collectively
probably like over thousands and

00:32:59.077,00:33:01.847
thousands and thousands... >> I
agree with that. >> And, uh, and

00:33:01.847,00:33:04.216
it's like, some of them were
really horrible. There's this

00:33:04.216,00:33:07.018
really offensive group, and, and
when I say offensive I mean when

00:33:07.018,00:33:09.988
we read it we get offended.
[laughter] I don't mean they use

00:33:09.988,00:33:12.524
bad words or anything... >> Yea,
not to name names, but... >>

00:33:12.524,00:33:15.894
Yea, I'm not naming any names.
You, if anybody reads advisories

00:33:15.894,00:33:18.496
they'll figure it out pretty
soon. [laughter] So these are

00:33:18.496,00:33:23.235
just some fields and some
guidance that we have for making

00:33:23.235,00:33:26.905
advisories and of course there's
some more here... Uh, one of the

00:33:26.905,00:33:31.877
big ones is, uhm, proof concept
code, uh, I think it's a really

00:33:31.877,00:33:37.349
important... uh, I, really
important sort of thing to prove

00:33:37.349,00:33:40.352
your case. Uhm, you know, when
you, when you disclose a

00:33:40.352,00:33:42.821
vulnerability to a vendor a lot
of times you get pushed back

00:33:42.821,00:33:45.991
like there's not even a real
issue here. Uh, and, uh, and of

00:33:45.991,00:33:50.595
course one the side of things it
is a bit hard to argue with a

00:33:50.595,00:33:53.365
shell. But it... uh, you don't
necessarily have to give anybody

00:33:53.365,00:33:56.368
a shell, uh, as your proof of
concept. It could be, could be

00:33:56.368,00:33:58.870
whatever you choose. It could be
a sequence of steps that they

00:33:58.870,00:34:03.608
managed to follow, to, verify
it. It could be, uhm, any kind

00:34:03.608,00:34:06.878
of level of maturity, proof of
concepts code, crash, crash

00:34:06.878,00:34:11.316
proof concepts. But do, do
remember like the more, sort of,

00:34:11.316,00:34:14.386
detailed information you can
learn and extract and provide to

00:34:14.386,00:34:17.856
them the easier it's gonna be
for them to deal with that

00:34:17.856,00:34:21.493
information. So one of the
reasons we have these particular

00:34:21.493,00:34:25.163
details here about advisory
contents is that a lot of

00:34:25.163,00:34:27.999
researches, especially beginning
researchers don't initially know

00:34:27.999,00:34:31.937
what information to provide. Or,
he might submit a bug report to

00:34:31.937,00:34:34.072
a bug bounty and it comes back
and says that you're not

00:34:34.072,00:34:37.075
providing enough information or
you're not communicating

00:34:37.075,00:34:40.011
clearly. [laughter] So, uh,
those fields that we have listed

00:34:40.011,00:34:43.048
in, you know, are on the slides
and will, you know, will be an

00:34:43.048,00:34:46.851
updated version of this slide.
Uh, we encourage you to really

00:34:46.851,00:34:50.722
look at those and consider
seriously capturing all of that

00:34:50.722,00:34:53.325
information. >> There's some
pros and cons that we came up

00:34:53.325,00:34:57.629
with. Uh, just basically, just
Steve and I ranting on all the

00:34:57.629,00:35:01.933
stuff we didn't like about
various advisories. Uh, you know

00:35:01.933,00:35:04.936
we want people to do simpler,
you know, simple stuff, plain

00:35:04.936,00:35:08.206
text is real easy. It's very
portable. It has a very low

00:35:08.206,00:35:14.012
attack surface... so... >> Ass
opposed to, let's say, pdf. >>

00:35:14.012,00:35:18.984
Yea which is like a web browser
basically. >> And, uh, some

00:35:18.984,00:35:22.887
people do like to do videos and,
uh, that's kinda cool but I have

00:35:22.887,00:35:25.590
a couple suggestions here. One
of the main ones being... is,

00:35:25.590,00:35:29.394
you know, respect the viewer of
the videos, you don't wanna make

00:35:29.394,00:35:32.797
your videos too long, uhm, but
you don't wanna go too quickly

00:35:32.797,00:35:37.202
either. Uhm and there's a couple
other considerations up there as

00:35:37.202,00:35:40.739
well. So you wanna be mindful
even of the formatting your

00:35:40.739,00:35:45.877
advisory goes out. [pause] >>
This one me? >> Yea. >> So, so,

00:35:45.877,00:35:48.613
what to expect from vendors. I
already mentioned some of the

00:35:48.613,00:35:53.351
stuff. You can expect total
cluelessness, uh, can u, expect

00:35:53.351,00:35:56.087
in some cases, for people to
threaten you with their legal

00:35:56.087,00:35:59.624
teams, uh, I don't know why they
do this, I think they're

00:35:59.624,00:36:03.995
confused. But, uh, you know,
these are just a bunch of, a

00:36:03.995,00:36:07.365
bunch of possibilities. >>
Basically every... >> Most good

00:36:07.365,00:36:10.535
companies these days, especially
the bigger ones, they're very

00:36:10.535,00:36:13.705
open to work with and actually,
amazingly, even sometimes a new

00:36:13.705,00:36:16.841
vendor that has never had to
deal with these problems comes

00:36:16.841,00:36:20.979
out actually understanding quite
easily and being very well, good

00:36:20.979,00:36:23.748
to work with as well. >> But one
thing to keep in mind is that

00:36:23.748,00:36:26.384
it's not like one size fits all
all the time. And every

00:36:26.384,00:36:29.320
disclosure winds up being some
kind of unique snowflake.

00:36:29.320,00:36:32.390
[audience noise] So you need to
be patient as mentioned before

00:36:32.390,00:36:38.229
and also be able to be flexible.
>> Keep an open mind. Uh, so...

00:36:38.229,00:36:40.532
[ahem] I'm the first, I think
the first bullet, like one time

00:36:40.532,00:36:45.170
I had fence we were trying to
report as "vuln" and uh, i tried

00:36:45.170,00:36:48.907
vuln calls, I tried email - well
in the other order, of course, I

00:36:48.907,00:36:51.943
tried emails and then phone
calls. And finally I got a

00:36:51.943,00:36:55.413
response from this security guy
there when I faxed them the

00:36:55.413,00:37:00.919
advisory. [laughter] Yea,I
guess... >> What year was that?

00:37:00.919,00:37:05.156
>> Uuuuuh, it was probably 2007.
>> Yea? >> Yea... [laughter] So

00:37:05.156,00:37:09.594
they, they were like "Oh, this
came out of the fax machine,

00:37:09.594,00:37:16.034
aaaah!". [laughter] "Let's call
'em!". Okay... [ahem] So, when

00:37:16.034,00:37:20.171
do we disclose publically? What
we like to see is for people to

00:37:20.171,00:37:24.008
disclose publicly in places that
are archived forever so that

00:37:24.008,00:37:26.344
becomes mailing lists,
basically. [audience noise] And

00:37:26.344,00:37:29.681
these, these other things on the
list. Like exploit db is in vuln

00:37:29.681,00:37:33.485
databases, those, those sites
are great and uh we hope they'll

00:37:33.485,00:37:36.421
live forever but... inca, some
cases in the past they have not

00:37:36.421,00:37:40.258
live forever. And ul, ultimately
those sites generally are

00:37:40.258,00:37:43.027
pulling from more public sites
that are archived forever

00:37:43.027,00:37:46.131
anyway. So, this , this just our
preference, if you wanna, you

00:37:46.131,00:37:50.301
know, put your stuff on your
blog, uh, to, for it to gain

00:37:50.301,00:37:53.438
readership, that's great. But
maybe also throw a note up on

00:37:53.438,00:37:57.709
one of these lists to get
traffic to your blog as well.

00:37:57.709,00:38:02.847
[pause] So, common mistakes to
avoid, you know, number one is

00:38:02.847,00:38:06.718
don't test other people's stuff
unless they let you. [laughter]

00:38:06.718,00:38:10.188
Uuuuh, I think there was one
case with Facebook bug-running

00:38:10.188,00:38:13.858
program where a guy, like, owned
the hell out of them, basically,

00:38:13.858,00:38:16.928
and then tried to do a bug
bounty with them. I don't think

00:38:16.928,00:38:20.999
that worked out really well for
the guy. [chuckle] >> Uh, we

00:38:20.999,00:38:23.601
have here on this slide in the
next one, we aren't gonna go

00:38:23.601,00:38:25.737
into any details. Especially
because we're running low on

00:38:25.737,00:38:29.574
time. But there are a lot of
common mistakes, uhm, that many

00:38:29.574,00:38:33.878
researchers make, including
ourselves actually. And, uh, why

00:38:33.878,00:38:35.880
don't we move ahead... >> Yes,
absolutely. If you guys wanna

00:38:35.880,00:38:38.917
hear some war stories afterwards
just hit us up afterwards.

00:38:38.917,00:38:42.954
[ahem] >> We have some real neat
to the, uh, to the tail-end of

00:38:42.954,00:38:46.491
this presentation. >> Yup. >>
Okay, so this is one of the, one

00:38:46.491,00:38:50.028
of the main ones here. This is
just sort of our own model and

00:38:50.028,00:38:53.164
our first crack at this. As far
as we know nobody else has sort

00:38:53.164,00:38:57.202
of started on this but, uhm,
we're trying to outline

00:38:57.202,00:39:00.805
different, uh, kinds of stages
of growth that you might

00:39:00.805,00:39:04.609
encounter in your career or in
your technical abilities when

00:39:04.609,00:39:07.412
you're doing vulnerability
research. So when you're just

00:39:07.412,00:39:09.948
starting out, you're starting
at, uh, more or less a newbie

00:39:09.948,00:39:13.618
phase you might have, you might
only know one crude technique

00:39:13.618,00:39:17.889
that you might apply against,
uhm, you know, easy software and

00:39:17.889,00:39:22.126
you make a lot of simple
mistakes. At some point once you

00:39:22.126,00:39:24.896
get, you become more familiar
with things you reach what we

00:39:24.896,00:39:28.866
call the workhorse stage where
you know a number of different

00:39:28.866,00:39:32.136
kinds of basic vulnerability
types, you can generally find

00:39:32.136,00:39:36.307
multiple issues, uh and the you
start to more or less get a hang

00:39:36.307,00:39:39.577
of, uh, certain kinds of
processes. Then when you start

00:39:39.577,00:39:43.681
to move more towards the subject
matter expert. These are the,

00:39:43.681,00:39:46.284
these are the times when you
really like watching and looking

00:39:46.284,00:39:49.587
for the newest and latest, uh,
techniques that other people

00:39:49.587,00:39:52.590
develop or you might, uh, you
might go and extend those

00:39:52.590,00:39:56.194
techniques that have already
been reported. And, uhm, you're

00:39:56.194,00:40:00.999
more or less pretty much, uhm,
treated or assumed as reliable

00:40:00.999,00:40:07.305
by, you know, uhm people like me
and someone, uh, and, uhm, at,

00:40:07.305,00:40:10.575
at some point you really start
to have a clear sense on, like,

00:40:10.575,00:40:15.179
what your own disclosure policy
is and you can relied on to find

00:40:15.179,00:40:18.583
a lot of things and to really
write a good solid quality

00:40:18.583,00:40:23.321
report. And finally upon
reaching the elite stage which,

00:40:23.321,00:40:26.791
not everyone needs to reach the
elite stage and not everyone has

00:40:26.791,00:40:30.061
to and not everyone wants to and
that's perfectly cool cause

00:40:30.061,00:40:32.497
there are way more
vulnerabilities out there than

00:40:32.497,00:40:36.234
there are vulnerability research
to handle them. But, uh, what I

00:40:36.234,00:40:41.306
think of a little bit of as an
elite researcher is you discover

00:40:41.306,00:40:45.677
or invent new vulnerability
classes, or you develop entirely

00:40:45.677,00:40:51.649
new techniques. Uhm, or, uh, uh,
you know, you give conference

00:40:51.649,00:40:57.121
and so on. You really sort of,
uh, uh, uhm push the industry

00:40:57.121,00:41:00.458
forward and that can take a
number of years. You're not

00:41:00.458,00:41:03.828
gonna just read a book or look
at a couple of blog posts and be

00:41:03.828,00:41:08.800
elite tomorrow... uhm, or next
year. So that's something to

00:41:08.800,00:41:13.004
keep in mind as well. >> Yea it
takes time for sure. I...

00:41:13.004,00:41:18.242
[pause] I can't read this again.
>> So let's get out my name on

00:41:18.242,00:41:22.280
it anyways. >> Yea okay. >>
You're free. [laughter] >> You

00:41:22.280,00:41:25.917
got only a minute or something
like that. >> Yup, so one thing

00:41:25.917,00:41:28.619
about, about the notion of
growth. There is a book by

00:41:28.619,00:41:32.223
Malcolm Gladwell, "Outliers",
which basically says that it

00:41:32.223,00:41:36.127
takes about 10-thousand hours
of, uh, focussed, effective

00:41:36.127,00:41:39.964
practice to reach a level of
expertise and so you can do the

00:41:39.964,00:41:42.133
math and that number may be
questionable but that's

00:41:42.133,00:41:45.503
something, uh, really to keep in
mind. But there are a couple of

00:41:45.503,00:41:48.406
different ways you could
progress a little bit further if

00:41:48.406,00:41:52.410
you want. >> I think we have
like three slides left. >> Yup.

00:41:52.410,00:41:53.845
>> You wanna do this one? Or you
want me to go ahead? >> Yea,

00:41:53.845,00:41:56.914
yea. >> It's got your name on
it. >> But.... [laughter] Ah...

00:41:56.914,00:42:00.251
>> I can do it if you want.
Getting tired? >> No, we're

00:42:00.251,00:42:03.087
getting, we're getting an "X"
from the goons so... >> "Get out

00:42:03.087,00:42:08.993
of here, guys, you talk too
much!" >> So, uh, we just wanted

00:42:08.993,00:42:11.529
to leave on this note on
feelings and fails, right? We

00:42:11.529,00:42:14.399
mentioned that we are not
perfect, uh, I believe that,

00:42:14.399,00:42:18.736
this is what I call the human
condition, which basically means

00:42:18.736,00:42:22.006
you always make mistakes and
have to deal with things you,

00:42:22.006,00:42:26.677
uh, your body tells you and
such. But, uh, feelings are

00:42:26.677,00:42:29.847
definitely a part of that so...
feelings are, remember that

00:42:29.847,00:42:32.483
feelings are okay, uh, there are
a number of times when you're

00:42:32.483,00:42:35.553
doing some deep research and
you're getting discouraged, you

00:42:35.553,00:42:38.489
might wanna find something
easier to do. you may want to,

00:42:38.489,00:42:41.626
uh, go at it a different way and
maybe just go to the beach for a

00:42:41.626,00:42:45.229
while. And, so, when other,
another one of these things is

00:42:45.229,00:42:48.566
you feel like you wanna keep
going and work really hard cause

00:42:48.566,00:42:51.936
you're addicted to something but
it's been like 17 hours that

00:42:51.936,00:42:53.938
you've been working on it, it
might be a good time to sleep.

00:42:56.741,00:42:59.143
Uhm, yea. [background noise]
Feelings are okay. [applause]

00:42:59.143,00:43:03.981
Failures are okay too.
[applause] >> There we go. Thank

00:43:03.981,00:43:08.419
you... >> Thank you everyone!
[applause] And we are available

00:43:08.419,00:43:11.522
to talk to anybody afterwards
down at the... >> Yea, we're

00:43:11.522,00:43:16.694
gonna go down, down the
escalator, somewhere there... >>

00:43:16.694,00:43:17.161
If everyone could please leave
the...!
