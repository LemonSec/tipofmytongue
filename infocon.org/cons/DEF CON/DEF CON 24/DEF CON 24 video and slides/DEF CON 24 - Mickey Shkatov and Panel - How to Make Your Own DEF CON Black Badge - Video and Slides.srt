00:00:00.133,00:00:02.736
[laughing]>>So I guess you're
all here to see how to make your
own Defcon black badge, right?

00:00:02.736,00:00:07.741
So yeah, you got do it yourself,
otherwise it's not gonna happen.
Um, we're gonna blow by the

00:00:12.713,00:00:18.886
agenda, because we have so many
slides and one hour. Um I'm
going to introduce us, um we are

00:00:18.886,00:00:24.625
DC503 from and Portland, Oregon.
That's Jessie, Jessie raise your
hand, he is the human computer.

00:00:24.625,00:00:29.630
Kenny, he really is good at pick
and place. Mike, senior
troubleshooter, trouble cau-

00:00:32.032,00:00:37.037
maker, maker, trouble maker,
sorry. Makers Mark is really
good. And you should introduce

00:00:39.206,00:00:44.211
everyone else. [laughing]
>>Alright, this is Mickey.
Mickey is Israeli but he's

00:00:48.549,00:00:55.322
actually the least Israeli
person I know. And, um, this is
Joe, Joe used to work for Intel,

00:00:55.322,00:01:00.260
but he reformed now. And then
there's Dean, raise your hand
Dean, Dean is the bricker of all

00:01:00.260,00:01:05.265
things, don't let him touch your
stuff. >>I'll be, I'll be doing
most of the talking. Um, Mike's

00:01:09.469,00:01:14.474
his first time speaking at
Defcon, so let's have him a good
welcome here, um, so [applause]

00:01:16.777,00:01:21.782
thank you, thank you. Anyone
here's there first Defcon, raise
your hand. Holy shit, okay

00:01:29.823,00:01:34.261
[laughter in the background]
never mind, er, there is a
tradition in Defcon for years

00:01:34.261,00:01:40.233
that if it's your first time
speaking at Defcon, the goons
come by, they give you a shot of

00:01:40.233,00:01:46.173
Jack Daniels and you take a
shot, but unfortunately this
year you cannot do that, the

00:01:46.173,00:01:51.178
goons have been barred from it.
We have our own, so Mike, your
first Defcon talk. [applause].

00:02:01.421,00:02:06.426
For the record, this booze has
been bought in this hotel.
[laughter] Okay, hold on. You

00:02:08.628,00:02:13.633
have animated gifs and stuff.
>>So, why why make a black badge
anyway, right? Like, what's the

00:02:18.538,00:02:25.278
point? You spend a lot of money,
countless hours, for what? For
the LOLs, right? We did it, we

00:02:25.278,00:02:30.283
wanna do it. I guess you all,
sta, sto-stood in lines, right?
We don't wanna stand in lines,

00:02:32.986,00:02:37.991
no one likes lines. Plus "Lost"
said it was impossible, and we
kinda like to prove the opposite

00:02:40.460,00:02:45.465
of people and we wanted to do it
anyway, it's a nice challenge.
So this talk is going to be

00:02:48.468,00:02:54.241
divided into three parts because
we did three badges. We did, er,
Defcon 22, and then we did a

00:02:54.241,00:02:59.246
Defcon 14, and then the 23 was,
er, the last one. And it's going
to be weird because, 22, 14, 23,

00:03:01.948,00:03:08.789
bear with us. Um how this all
started is an interesting story.
We just ended up at Defcon,

00:03:08.789,00:03:13.794
ended after Defcon 22, we come
home and we open, er, whatever
open source schematics released

00:03:16.596,00:03:21.601
from, um, from "Lost" and it's
amazing. It's the human badge
and we saw the Uber badge and

00:03:24.504,00:03:29.509
they're almost identical. We're
like: "Holy shit, we can do
this, we can make a copy. What

00:03:31.611,00:03:36.616
do we need?" So we downloaded
all the files, played around
with it, and we kinda know

00:03:39.686,00:03:46.626
Eagle, if you don't know what
Eagle is, you're lucky. And plus
we know "Lost", we love him,

00:03:46.626,00:03:51.631
he's a great a guy and we wanted
to surprise him with one of,
your know, our, er, donation to

00:03:53.733,00:03:58.738
his work. That's the page links
and forums where it's er located
at. >>So, er, yeah. I've been

00:04:07.414,00:04:11.651
using Eagle for like fifteen
years, um which is the only
reason I don't use kicad because

00:04:11.651,00:04:16.990
there's like a learning curve,
and so, er, "Lost" represented
the badge users DipTrace which

00:04:16.990,00:04:23.330
is a software program that makes
stuff and er, like hey it has an
export to Eagle function, I know

00:04:23.330,00:04:27.768
Eagle, that's a lot whole easier
than using like a software I
don't know. Has anyone here ever

00:04:27.768,00:04:34.141
designed a PCV before? If you
can imagine a paint program that
doesn't do what you tell it to

00:04:34.141,00:04:38.278
do, that would be fucking
frustrating, wouldn't it be?
That's what EDA tool, board

00:04:38.278,00:04:44.451
design tools are like. Um, so
ja, I know like Eagle, we can
export to Eagle, we'll go that

00:04:44.451,00:04:48.822
path, we can try that and yeah,
it was just a mess, so we went
back and then Mickey had tried

00:04:48.822,00:04:53.360
to-to open up this program
DipTrace, which is a Windows
software >>I think we tried

00:04:53.360,00:04:59.566
on-on OSX, Windows and Linux
>>Yeah, and I argued to run it
against linux running under

00:04:59.566,00:05:03.703
wine, so I ran the Windows
version on linux, and it worked!
[laughter]. So, er whatever, um

00:05:03.703,00:05:06.907
so we had that software and
basically we, we took it, it's
the same schematic, it's the

00:05:06.907,00:05:12.445
same layout and everything, what
we had to add to it was all, the
bits and pieces, the er...

00:05:12.445,00:05:16.883
>>What, what.. >> C' mon you
guys, you're further away. Um,
I've already spilled once today,

00:05:16.883,00:05:22.689
er, DipTrace, yeah, DipTrace is
an interesting set of software,
so basically we, we, we changed

00:05:22.689,00:05:26.259
the outline of the badge. The
circuit was the same, we had to
add a bunch of artwork to it.

00:05:26.259,00:05:30.397
And I think in the next slide
>>the next slide, yeah >>You're
gonna have >>what you see >>Some

00:05:30.397,00:05:35.402
kind of... >>What you see here,
that is um, days to weeks of
Googling. Yeah, so, you, we

00:05:38.405,00:05:43.076
have, by the way that's a public
picture of the black badges, so
everything we went on was erm,

00:05:43.076,00:05:48.882
was a public pic -picture of the
black badge. For the 22 we did,
we have, we had no access to a

00:05:48.882,00:05:52.752
real one, >>So what's really
cool when you look at these
badges and you see all those

00:05:52.752,00:05:56.256
pins on either side? Those are
point one inch headers, so if
you're trying to scale

00:05:56.256,00:06:00.393
something, you can use those
points as like really good
indicators to what size is. So

00:06:00.393,00:06:04.965
basically taking that we could
take this photograph angle, we
could orientate it properly, we

00:06:04.965,00:06:08.668
could actually get like
millimetre precision to where
every single silk screen and

00:06:08.668,00:06:13.340
every single like metal area on
that board was. Yeah, and Mickey
did all the artwork stuff, and

00:06:13.340,00:06:18.245
he sits there in MS paint
pushing buttons, so. >>[laughs]
paint dot net. >>paint dot net,

00:06:18.245,00:06:23.583
whatever >>open source >>Windows
something >>Er, it's a really
cool tool to use, I, we were

00:06:23.583,00:06:29.723
sitting in the 503 hacking space
that control H1 in Portland and
Joe has this technique of of

00:06:29.723,00:06:34.661
measuring on screen, he takes
like a piece of paper and he
puts it on the monitor and he

00:06:34.661,00:06:39.666
measures it and he does this and
that's the spot t needs to go
>>I'm no the only one, I swear

00:06:39.666,00:06:45.739
>>He swears it's legit, I don't
know. Anyway, so we had this
picture, it's public. >>Where

00:06:45.739,00:06:50.744
the hell do I get that Uber
font? Open Google, free fonts,
open 1001 free fonts er, show me

00:06:56.049,00:07:02.656
er hundred results at a time and
I type in I wanna see how you
show "uber" in that front. And

00:07:02.656,00:07:08.194
you go page by page until, I
find something similar and I
found the exact font for that.

00:07:08.194,00:07:11.798
>>Actually, I wrote, I wrote an
AI image recognition program
that found the font. Searched

00:07:11.798,00:07:15.302
them all automatically. I just
didn't want to tell you.
[laughs] >>I hate you Joe. >>You

00:07:15.302,00:07:19.606
know that's a joke because I
haven't even... >>I haven't even
gotten the Korean yet [laughs].

00:07:19.606,00:07:25.812
Um, the next up is the skull, so
I've been, I spent like two
months looking for that skull, I

00:07:25.812,00:07:31.184
took a picture of it with my
phone, as, with my camera, as
high res as I can, cropped it

00:07:31.184,00:07:36.890
out, do reverse image search,
nothing helped. Then I thought,
hmm, it's a PCB, maybe it's

00:07:36.890,00:07:41.261
inversed, so I inverted the
colours and I found the image
and it's the skull and bones on

00:07:41.261,00:07:48.068
the blood. I actually had to
literally Google: skull and
bones image search, and page by

00:07:48.068,00:07:53.073
page until I found that alien
skull and continue from there.
The Korean is interesting. I,

00:07:56.609,00:08:01.548
er, kinda hate "Lost" for that.
Because in Korean, when you type
a letter, it's weird, because

00:08:04.951,00:08:10.357
you type another letter and it
changes the word, I don't know,
it's like that little tiny man

00:08:10.357,00:08:15.362
dancing at the top there? The
top right, the the one legged
man, the one legged devil,

00:08:17.464,00:08:23.303
that's like four characters
together and if you type the
wrong one it has, er he has two

00:08:23.303,00:08:28.875
two legs and then he has one arm
and – it took me hours to figure
out the right combination for

00:08:28.875,00:08:33.346
that >>I thought those were a
bunch of [inaudible]sisters, I
couldn't figure them out >>For

00:08:33.346,00:08:38.351
the 23 it was easier, I just
asked a friend to ask his Korean
friend to tell us what says. I

00:08:38.351,00:08:44.791
should have done that to begin
with. And we ended up with this,
so this is the gerber for the,

00:08:44.791,00:08:50.163
the Defcon 22 black badge. >>So
have any of you made a board
before? You have the schematic,

00:08:50.163,00:08:54.367
the schematic is all the
circuits and where, what
connects to what. The layout is

00:08:54.367,00:08:58.905
where you go and place the
components in relation to each
other and you know, place the

00:08:58.905,00:09:02.308
routes where everything goes.
But still, that's not like the
file format that the board

00:09:02.308,00:09:06.613
designer, board manufacturer's
gonna want, they want a gerber
which is kinda like a cat

00:09:06.613,00:09:12.652
organising format. It's all
text. But figuring out how to
extract gerbers from DipTrace is

00:09:12.652,00:09:17.190
pretty interesting because they
have like a 101 options.
Basically, it, I can't remember,

00:09:17.190,00:09:20.760
this is the one that they want
you to like use their service to
buy, order boards? >>Yeah, you

00:09:20.760,00:09:24.597
want gerbers ... >>So, >>...to
pay us money >>Yeah gerbers pay
us money, yeah you just check

00:09:24.597,00:09:28.268
the right boxes, um, you can
actually get gerbers out of
them, and you have to check the

00:09:28.268,00:09:33.273
right boxes over and over again,
and do it a hundred times and,
or write a script to do it, you

00:09:33.273,00:09:38.978
know, if you don't like doing
stuff manually. >>And after we
have the schematic, we have,

00:09:38.978,00:09:43.917
well the layout, we have the
silk screens that go on the
badge. We need to figure out the

00:09:43.917,00:09:50.290
parts. So, comes the part of the
bomb where we er, laid it on
Dean. [laughing] We have a

00:09:50.290,00:09:55.295
picture of of the the speaker
badge we had from 22, because we
gave a talk at 22, and we put

00:09:57.430,00:10:04.204
numbers on each component on a
high res picture, send it to
Dean and said:" Dean, figure

00:10:04.204,00:10:10.043
this shit out." >>So, let's see
if this microphone works, okay
we're good. Er, so I'm not good

00:10:10.043,00:10:16.049
with Korean, or Eagle so this is
what I got stuck with doing. Um,
they put a bunch of numbers on

00:10:16.049,00:10:22.622
the board, and then we had the
bill of materials which they
call bombs, which is scary, um,

00:10:22.622,00:10:28.294
that like, we had the bomb from
the parralax website, and we
didn't necessarily know, where

00:10:28.294,00:10:33.299
all the components went, and so
I went through and where all the
orange dots are, er, I verified

00:10:35.468,00:10:39.138
with a multimeter that this
actual component that we think
it is, cause, like a bunch of

00:10:39.138,00:10:43.610
like different resistors have
different resistances, that are
like just kind of ...what?

00:10:45.745,00:10:51.751
[audience calls out] Okay. Is
this better? [audience responds]
Yay, >>Move forward >>okay, I

00:10:51.751,00:10:56.256
pulled this thing as far
as...okay, we're good. >>I was
talking to them, Dean. Swallow

00:10:56.256,00:11:03.196
the mic >>Yeah, we're good >>Um,
[laughs] damnit, um yeah so,
there's all these orange dots

00:11:03.196,00:11:06.766
everywhere, so I spent a long
time like going through with the
multimeter and making sure that

00:11:06.766,00:11:13.273
each component was the component
that I thought it was from the
list of components that exists.

00:11:13.273,00:11:16.876
Er, just so that we knew that,
you know, the right thing was in
the right places and there were

00:11:16.876,00:11:21.681
some differences like, um the
colors of some of the black
badge LEDs are different from

00:11:21.681,00:11:26.686
the colors of the er human PCVs
that we had. Um, er, there are
strange differences like, even

00:11:29.455,00:11:35.695
like what kind of version of
resistors do you need in
situations and whatever, yeah,

00:11:35.695,00:11:40.333
so, it was fun and exciting and
I did stuff with electricity and
probably broke some stuff, but

00:11:40.333,00:11:44.938
>>Sorry, I promised Case I'd
call him up for a shot on stage
>>Yay >>Take it, take it, take

00:11:44.938,00:11:49.943
it [laughter][applause] Sorry
for that interruption. Here you
go Casey. Okay, you're done.

00:11:59.719,00:12:05.224
>>So, er, after we did all that
stuff we had a lot of parts it
came to order the boards and

00:12:05.224,00:12:08.194
there's a lot of variables that
you can get when you order
boards, and there's a lot of

00:12:08.194,00:12:11.297
places where you can order them
from and some of them are
expensive and some of them are

00:12:11.297,00:12:15.034
cheap. If you actually want
something specific, it's
expensive, it's really

00:12:15.034,00:12:20.206
expensive. But if you're kinda
like, er, you have low
standards, like me, it's really

00:12:20.206,00:12:24.110
easy. You just find the cheapest
place, that ships these boards
from China and um and so there's

00:12:24.110,00:12:29.582
this place I've used regularly
and um, and they always ship
pretty quickly when I get bulk

00:12:29.582,00:12:34.187
orders and they had just right
finish so the right color of
black and the shininess of the

00:12:34.187,00:12:36.322
black, so we decided to go with
them. And we ordered a first run
of the boards and what you see

00:12:36.322,00:12:38.858
there is the first run, and we
looked at it and there's a
couple things you might notice,

00:12:38.858,00:12:40.860
um if you're Mickey and you're
really really erm, erm very um,
attention, attentive to detail

00:12:40.860,00:12:47.667
or something like that um so you
see that there's like that the
headers are pins on each side?

00:12:47.667,00:12:52.672
The left and right on the front
of the badge, there's a little
white outline around them and

00:12:58.144,00:13:02.548
you'll notice, it's just a tiny
bit too low, right? And you'll
get the Korean text at the very

00:13:02.548,00:13:06.286
bottom and it touches all the
way to the bottom of the badge,
which wasn't the case with the

00:13:06.286,00:13:10.056
original badge. The other thing
is the spacing of the numbers on
the back were little bit off.

00:13:10.056,00:13:15.161
Um, has anyone seen any other
differences they might notice?
Did anyone notice the dick-butt

00:13:15.161,00:13:20.600
underneath the chip? Yeah, so if
ever, ever not really sure
whether it's legit or not, just

00:13:20.600,00:13:25.605
take off the CPU and if there's
a dick butt there, it's real and
if it's not, then it's fake.

00:13:27.674,00:13:32.679
[laughter] okay? And actually
there's something I wanted to
say, I don't usually say this in

00:13:32.679,00:13:37.684
talks, but cyber, cyber, cyber,
cyber ... >>Take a shot >>
...threat. Threat threat

00:13:47.193,00:13:52.198
threat.threat, okay. [laughter]
thank you [audience responds,
laughter] >>Oh, the lot number,

00:13:54.801,00:13:59.605
Joe >>you want more? >>You
forgot the lot number. >>Oh yeah
there's a lot number, on top

00:13:59.605,00:14:04.877
left >>top left >>See on Uber
there's a lot number, so you
know, cheap places, they don't

00:14:04.877,00:14:08.781
speak much English, but they
assemble boards quickly so they
usually don't worry, er, so we

00:14:08.781,00:14:13.786
got a second run, and we fixed
all those things. The hard part
is like, does that mean we have

00:14:15.955,00:14:20.293
to move our silk screen up a
little but or is it tolerance of
the ones we made? I think we

00:14:20.293,00:14:24.864
moved it up half the difference?
>>And it's also the the the
thickness of the boards they

00:14:24.864,00:14:30.103
use. Remember the first batch we
got was thinner... >>Oh yeha
>>really thin >>We forgot, we

00:14:30.103,00:14:35.007
used a non standard thickness,
>>Yeah they were like >>Sorry, I
don't remember >>that's what we

00:14:35.007,00:14:38.845
got >>then we chose a thicker
one and it was better, er, um
hey whatever >>yeah, whatever

00:14:38.845,00:14:42.849
floats your boat >>So what we
did, I also, I also asked them,
and this was tough, with the

00:14:42.849,00:14:46.719
language barrier, but they
managed to to put the lot code
on the back, so when they do

00:14:46.719,00:14:52.024
these boards, we're not ordering
er 20 000 boards like "Lost"
does, we're ordering few. Number

00:14:52.024,00:14:57.430
to not be disclosed. And er
[laughter] special requests
don't er come out well so they

00:14:57.430,00:15:00.366
put these on a panel with a
whole bunch of other people that
are making their own fake black

00:15:00.366,00:15:04.637
badges, and we don't want that
panel so we put a little box on
the back. You see on the left

00:15:04.637,00:15:09.275
side there's a little white box,
inside that, we, I asked him
like eight times to put the lot

00:15:09.275,00:15:13.713
code in there, and he'd say: "oh
yes, oh yes" and then I'd ask
him again, he said "sure" and

00:15:13.713,00:15:18.151
then they finally did it, which
was great, so whatever. Um, so
actually it's concealed by the

00:15:18.151,00:15:21.320
battery. So the other thing if
you like ever want to find out
if it's real or not, look

00:15:21.320,00:15:25.391
underneath the battery, and look
for that lot code, and yeah, if
it's under there, then it's

00:15:25.391,00:15:32.231
real. >>So now, we have we have
the boards, we have silk skin,
everything is ready. Now the

00:15:32.231,00:15:35.668
next stage is manufacturing, so
these are 0402s, right? >>0603s
>>0603s, not that terrible. 0603

00:15:35.668,00:15:37.670
means point six of them, no 6mm
by 3mm. point zero six inches by
point zero three inches, sorry I

00:15:37.670,00:15:44.143
don't do [inaudible]units >>so
these are actually kinda big, er
if you do a whole lot of service

00:15:44.143,00:15:49.148
network, then this is a very
convenient size. I can talk into
the mic even more...hello

00:15:59.358,00:16:05.998
>>Thank you Kenny >>How's this
workin' for you? Yeah, is this
good? Ahh yeah >>Deeper? >>no,

00:16:05.998,00:16:11.003
okay. I don't know if my voice
goes much deeper. So as I was
saying, these are the big ones,

00:16:13.873,00:16:18.211
these these resistors here
0603s, they're actually a very
convenient size if you're making

00:16:18.211,00:16:22.949
a small project by hand, work
with those 0603s they're pretty
great. Er, these are very

00:16:22.949,00:16:29.255
carefully organised, that is not
my work. I, I'm usually very
fast and just like throw the

00:16:29.255,00:16:34.994
things on the boards, but it's
kinda hassle to pull all the
parts out of the bags and put

00:16:34.994,00:16:39.565
them on the board, so having a
helper is fantastic, and I was
lucky enough to have Jessie as

00:16:39.565,00:16:44.904
my helper who is amazing,
meticulous and a machine. And he
aligned all of these resistors

00:16:44.904,00:16:49.609
for me so I could more rapidly
place them on the board, so that
was fantastic. >>So Jessie was

00:16:49.609,00:16:54.614
the pick and Kenny was the
place? >>Er, so here we have an
uber badge actually there're

00:16:56.716,00:17:01.587
five of them barely visible
inside the toaster oven, er,
this is actually a reflow of

00:17:01.587,00:17:08.561
them that I had access to at the
lab and er the process here is
fairly simple. The idea is erm,

00:17:08.561,00:17:13.566
we use some lasers, we use some
caustic chemicals, not nearly as
caustic as yellow cake, but hey,

00:17:15.568,00:17:21.540
we have our own fun, so first
pass is to take some of those
gerbers that have what's called

00:17:21.540,00:17:26.546
a um, a a stencil, er, or a
solder piece mask. And build a
stencil, and the stencil is, we

00:17:30.883,00:17:35.855
were just using parchment paper,
laser cut with a pretty standard
laser cutter that you'll find at

00:17:35.855,00:17:42.061
a lot of hacker spaces, and er
lay that over each badge and
just sorta squeegee on solder

00:17:42.061,00:17:46.098
paste and then you have the
solder paste in all the right
places and just lay the parts on

00:17:46.098,00:17:49.468
top of it. Pretty easy and
straight forward. >>You know if
you need to you can also use one

00:17:49.468,00:17:53.873
of those laminated paper human
badges, you know as a stencil,
if you wanna use for it >>Yeah,

00:17:53.873,00:17:57.543
what else you gonna do with it,
I think, well, get into some
talks I guess. Yeah, so, it's

00:17:57.543,00:18:02.048
kinda a time consuming process.
You put this solder paste on and
you put a whole bunch of parts

00:18:02.048,00:18:06.986
on, and then throw it in the
oven, and then it pops out and
it's ready to go. Solder on a

00:18:06.986,00:18:10.323
few more components later, like
the er battery holder, because
you can't do that in the oven,

00:18:10.323,00:18:15.628
and er power it on and see
what's broken. Usually when you
take it out of the oven there

00:18:15.628,00:18:20.232
are going to be some problems
you have to fix, a few stutter
bridges on the, you know, finer

00:18:20.232,00:18:25.137
pins spacing parts and just go
back to it with some soldering
wick and give it a little bit of

00:18:25.137,00:18:31.510
flux and it's, em, not too bad.
So, this is something that I do
for, a si, a side gig, er, I

00:18:31.510,00:18:36.882
just build tiny stuff, I also
unbuild tiny stuff so, if you
have a sniper rifle and you want

00:18:36.882,00:18:43.155
to get it the flash off it, let
me know, er, that's one of the
things I do. Er, but don't be

00:18:43.155,00:18:48.494
afraid of this, surface mount
soldering for a lot people seems
really like challenging like, a

00:18:48.494,00:18:53.899
lot to learn and "oh man my
hands aren't steady enough" I
hear it so often, "oh gosh I'm

00:18:53.899,00:18:58.671
terrible at soldering," from
people at other hacker spaces,
but it's really not too bad if

00:18:58.671,00:19:02.808
you take some time to figure out
the techniques. There are a few
things that will help a lot,

00:19:02.808,00:19:07.013
mostly figuring out how to
stabilize your hands. If you're
just holding your arm out, it's

00:19:07.013,00:19:11.217
not going to be very stable. If
you rest your wrists on the
table, it will be a lot more

00:19:11.217,00:19:17.289
stable. Simple tricks like that
go a long way. Try it out, start
with a simple project like a

00:19:17.289,00:19:22.294
goon badge. It only has a few
parts on it, it's really easy.
>>Right. And er once we had the

00:19:24.463,00:19:29.468
badge by the way, this is it,
it's er a working. This is a
fake one, it works, it blinks.

00:19:32.605,00:19:37.043
Um, we did flash it with the
human badge firmware because we
didn't have the Uber badge

00:19:37.043,00:19:39.245
firmware or any other firmware.
But, er, it's passable right?
Okay. >>So we got the badges and

00:19:39.245,00:19:44.250
we get to Defcon and we're like,
"What do we do with this?" >>But
did it work? >>And Mike..hmm?

00:19:48.254,00:19:59.231
>>Did it work? >>It worked, yeah
[laughs] [laughing] >>We got
through erm, black badge

00:19:59.231,00:20:04.236
registration, registration,
sorry, anyway so um a few days
go by inside of into Defcon and

00:20:06.672,00:20:11.677
you know there's the EFF badge
contest and Mike is like texting
me Saturday noon, and it's like

00:20:14.313,00:20:19.952
4AM for like a Defcon attendant,
right? There is a badge contest
happening right now, get your

00:20:19.952,00:20:24.957
ass over here [laughter]. I run
over there and and we won it. We
won the badge hacking contest

00:20:27.660,00:20:32.665
for the for the black badge. Um
and here's a couple of cool
shots. This is a real one next

00:20:35.000,00:20:40.005
to a fake one. So anyone want to
guess which one is the real one?
Yell it. [audience responds]

00:20:44.643,00:20:51.283
Left is the real one? If you
think the left one is the real
one, raise your hand. If you

00:20:51.283,00:20:56.288
think the right one is the real
one, raise your hand. The right
one is the real one. [chuckles].

00:21:01.527,00:21:07.933
We have a small, a short video
of them working side by side. We
had um, participated in that

00:21:07.933,00:21:12.705
contest that had a Defcon 22
black badge, he ran to his room,
brought it back and we,

00:21:12.705,00:21:17.710
er...wanna play it? And we had
them side by side. What you will
see is the Ube badge

00:21:22.581,00:21:27.586
communicating with supposedly
human badge firmware. Through
IR. It works. [applause]. That

00:21:39.498,00:21:46.005
is the closest we get to a demo
at this talk [laughter]. Now,
why did we do the Defcon 14

00:21:46.005,00:21:49.441
badge to begin with is an
interesting story. You might've
noticed that Mike hasn't said

00:21:49.441,00:21:54.480
anything. Well, because we were
all doing the 22 and Mike as
like, "I want in, I want in!"

00:21:54.480,00:21:58.551
and we were like, er, um, you
know what? Everyone's doing
something and everyone's

00:21:58.551,00:22:05.124
covering practically everything,
so um we need you to do
something, to do like,

00:22:05.124,00:22:09.895
contribute. "Let's do another
badge!" >>We done with
everything on time we need like

00:22:09.895,00:22:14.767
a last minute project, so maybe
you can start with that
[laughter] >>This is a whole

00:22:14.767,00:22:20.639
story by itself, it's gonna be
hilarious. So me and Mike worked
on the 14. By the way this is

00:22:20.639,00:22:25.644
the only picture I found online
from Defcon 14. >>How many hours
did you look for that...on

00:22:28.013,00:22:34.887
Google? >>I am the Google image
master [laughter] >>Master what?
[more laughter] >>So why do the

00:22:34.887,00:22:40.025
14 anyway, right? Because we we,
Joe Grant, he's from Portalnd,
we love 'em, if you ever met Joe

00:22:40.025,00:22:45.965
Grant he, you know, he is the
sweetest person. Ever. And we
wanted to surprise him and it

00:22:45.965,00:22:52.938
was...when we showed this to him
it was hilarious. He he freaked
out, "you did this is Eagle?"

00:22:52.938,00:22:57.810
[laughter] and yeah, that was
really impressive. We thought
this would be the easiest badge

00:22:57.810,00:23:02.748
to make. Not quite. >>If easiest
match makes, then Mike found the
hardest way to make it.

00:23:05.751,00:23:11.757
[laughter] >>Yeah, so the
Defcon14 black badge was the
human badge in black. >>So, that

00:23:11.757,00:23:15.961
seems pretty easy, right? >>Eat
it, eat it, eat the mic
[laughter] >>Just spray paint

00:23:15.961,00:23:20.966
right? Er, so that seems pretty
easy right? You just like, you
know, make another one, just

00:23:20.966,00:23:25.971
like that but black. Right? This
is easy. Um, you know, maybe it
wasn't exactly so easy. Um,

00:23:30.743,00:23:35.748
unlike the 22 they didn't just
publish you anything really. You
had to find like a 14 badge,

00:23:38.684,00:23:43.689
fortunately we had someone who
had a 14 black badge and we had
a human badge >>From Dean, Dean

00:23:47.326,00:23:51.363
has a human badge, Jessie
actually has.. >>Jessie has one
too >>Jessie has two legit black

00:23:51.363,00:23:57.303
badges [laughter] by the way.
Two, two legit ones. I don't
know how many unlegit ones...but

00:23:57.303,00:24:02.341
two legit ones. >>Did we mention
he's smart? >>Yeah, he's a smart
one >>He's smart, Jessie's

00:24:02.341,00:24:07.713
smart. >>Watch out for this guy.
>>So yeah you know, we took some
measurements and everything is

00:24:07.713,00:24:11.984
on the the like 22, things are
like we have the point one inch
headers and things lined up

00:24:11.984,00:24:16.989
appropriately and it seems like
from photographs you kinda
figure out what's going on.

00:24:26.031,00:24:29.234
[muffled speaking] So, you know,
it seems like this should be
like easy to do, but you know,

00:24:29.234,00:24:32.838
it was a long time ago, and a
galaxy far far away and they
didn't know about maybe like

00:24:32.838,00:24:35.174
putting things on a grid so er,
we worked from photographs. And
er, so in order to get to, in

00:24:35.174,00:24:40.179
order to get to the er, to the
part where we had it like on a
PCV, on, in the EDA on Eagle, um

00:24:55.294,00:25:00.232
we basically took, er,
photographs, scaled them.
Mickey, like, um some sort of

00:25:03.068,00:25:08.874
obsessed monkey, like traced
them in like MS paint 95 or
something [laughter] at like

00:25:08.874,00:25:13.879
4000DPI, and um, you know what
happens when you put like a
4000DPI bit map into into eagle,

00:25:17.916,00:25:22.921
the world's crappiest but free
EDA software? [laughter] it just
explodes. So, okay, that wasn't

00:25:25.891,00:25:30.896
gonna work. And it doesn't
really support any vector
formats, so okay, this is

00:25:33.699,00:25:39.038
obvious what we need to do, we
need to take from the
photographs, make these high

00:25:39.038,00:25:44.042
resolution bit maps, er, trace
those bit maps into a vector
format, simplify that vector

00:25:46.178,00:25:51.183
format into a series of polygons
and then write a script that
makes, er, takes those polygons,

00:25:53.585,00:25:58.791
does er, um does a projection of
them so they are in the right
place >>This sounds like a

00:25:58.791,00:26:03.729
software solution to a hardware
problem, Mike [laughter] >>And
then like import 'em into Eagle

00:26:06.799,00:26:13.739
and hope it doesn't explode. And
at least one time it did not
explode. [laughter] and then

00:26:13.739,00:26:18.811
just go over and trace and trace
and trace and trace, and we're
like, okay, you know, this is

00:26:18.811,00:26:23.816
going to be easy. Um, and then
we discovered a quirk of Eagle,
well it's free but, but, um it

00:26:27.586,00:26:33.859
has this weird thing that says
like, the free version can't do
anything over 80mm by 100mm and

00:26:33.859,00:26:38.864
you know, that's like, and some
ula about like you know you sign
your life away, and I didn't

00:26:41.200,00:26:46.004
read any of that. And so I just
proceeded and it let's you make
the board that's this big and

00:26:46.004,00:26:51.009
let's me place the cut outs
that's this big, but you know,
it turns out, that while it lets

00:26:53.045,00:26:59.551
you place any components over
80mm, and the badge is bigger
than 80mm. And um, this wouldn't

00:26:59.551,00:27:04.490
have been too much of a problem,
except for this was like this
was probably you know, three

00:27:06.959,00:27:12.498
days before con or something
[laughter] and we're like oh
shit, oh shit, oh shit what are

00:27:12.498,00:27:18.337
we gonna do, what are we gonna
do and er, we can't call the cad
company and buy a real licence

00:27:18.337,00:27:21.073
because they're asleep and
they're in Germany, what are we
gonna do? Then we're like, wait

00:27:21.073,00:27:26.078
a minute, you know, you only
have to have it within 80mm to
place the components so, and all

00:27:28.547,00:27:33.552
the components are within 80 mm,
so we can, we can just do that.
All we have to do, is redo

00:27:35.721,00:27:41.793
everything we did before in
terms of projecting all of the
things, placing all the things.

00:27:41.793,00:27:46.798
So that's no problem. Okay so,
we got our gerbers in line and
we got that all worked out and

00:27:51.803,00:27:55.674
now we just, all we have to do
is have it made and assemble it.
This is no problem, right? We're

00:27:55.674,00:28:00.712
probably like, you know, two
days before con at this point.
It's fine. >>It was, it was, er,

00:28:00.712,00:28:07.085
it was a really really, like the
week before we were talking
about Mike. We need to find

00:28:07.085,00:28:13.592
someone, er, sorry it was a week
before and we need to find
someone to make these in black,

00:28:13.592,00:28:17.863
and you'd think it would be easy
to find someone who makes these
these PCVs in black... >>You

00:28:17.863,00:28:24.703
need two things. I need, I need
PCVs that are black, now black
is not green [laughter] and I

00:28:24.703,00:28:29.708
need it like NOW. [more
laughter] and I called every
board house that I could in the

00:28:32.578,00:28:37.583
US, like I need unspecified
number black PCVs, two cut outs,
you know, one ounce [inaudible

00:28:42.921,00:28:48.160
blah blah blah blah blah, black,
you know black solder mask. Can
you do that? Every single one

00:28:48.160,00:28:53.265
was like: yes, yes we can do
that, we'll have that to you
tomorrow. Yes, yes we can do

00:28:53.265,00:28:59.438
that, yes we can. And then now
you, get a phone call, like
okay, here's all my money,

00:28:59.438,00:29:05.744
because, er, if you want boards
tomorrow, that's expensive.
Okay, here, here's all my money,

00:29:05.744,00:29:10.849
and then they would call me
back, after they took my money,
about two hours later, when I'm

00:29:10.849,00:29:14.720
hoping to get like, okay, you
know you're going to give a
message that boards have been

00:29:14.720,00:29:19.725
mad, then they're like: "You,
know, what about green?"
[laughter]. And er, er the first

00:29:22.094,00:29:27.599
guy, I was like, you know,
that-that's that's not okay,
give me my money back, by like

00:29:27.599,00:29:33.672
the fifth guy, I'm like,
motherfuckers [more laughter]
and, er the last guy called back

00:29:33.672,00:29:39.778
and said, "what about green?"
and I was about to go on a
really, um, long swear word,

00:29:39.778,00:29:44.783
blatant tirade with him, and er
he said er, "you know we can do
black, but you have to buy the

00:29:46.885,00:29:51.890
whole panel." And I thought, er
well okay, that's kinda more
than I'm maybe looking for, but,

00:29:57.195,00:30:04.002
okay we can do that. Um, and he
said, you know "this, this will
this will make it, you know,

00:30:04.002,00:30:08.073
this make it so there's no lot
numbers on it, which is funny
because we had talked for about

00:30:08.073,00:30:13.078
half an hour earlier about it
having no lot numbers.
[chuckles] but you know, it

00:30:17.149,00:30:23.522
turned out pretty okay. This is,
er, do we have real one?
[muffled speaking from the

00:30:23.522,00:30:28.927
panel]. This is the fake one?
Yeah this is real. >>Is it a
real fake? >>It's a real fake,

00:30:28.927,00:30:33.932
oh I have it backwards, and er
Jessie, you have the real Defcon
14 black badge, and you're

00:30:36.401,00:30:42.941
wearing the fake one. [muffled
response from the other speaker]
Oh, okay cool. Okay, so it looks

00:30:42.941,00:30:48.413
pretty good, you know, it turned
out,er, pretty well, you know
there's there's the levels of

00:30:48.413,00:30:58.690
er, success like fool a goon,
fool DT, er fool Joe Grant. We
got pretty good [laughs] and er,

00:30:58.690,00:31:03.628
you know, that's what the final
image processing output looked
like. And er, when we finally

00:31:07.365,00:31:13.171
had it, you fabricated, but you
notice like in the story I
didn't tell you about like

00:31:13.171,00:31:19.511
assembling it or anything,
that's just get a board in hand,
so this is fine, you know it's

00:31:19.511,00:31:26.318
just some soldering we we can do
that really quick, um, well you
know, we can that really quick

00:31:26.318,00:31:32.090
in our hotel room. So I brought
my entire like solder board
station to Vegas, and er, the

00:31:32.090,00:31:37.095
night before con, we're like
feverishly soldering this stuff
in our hotel room. And er, you

00:31:40.465,00:31:46.605
know, I think it worked out
pretty okay. And like Mickey
said, we said, "oh my god,

00:31:46.605,00:31:51.610
they're having a...it works kind
of, okay, er Mickey's reminding
me that , it works in the sense

00:31:54.780,00:32:00.619
that. Er, you can er, you can
win the badge pageant and you
can impress Joe Grant and fool

00:32:00.619,00:32:06.458
DT and fool goons, but like, I
don't know what exactly what
went wrong at 3am in my hotel

00:32:06.458,00:32:11.463
room, but it didn't actually
function [laughs]. But um, >>how
many components? >>Hmm? >>How

00:32:14.933,00:32:19.805
many components? >>Oh, oh this
is embarrassing >>Isn't that why
you brought me up here? To shame

00:32:19.805,00:32:24.810
all of you? >>Well like, you
know, less than ten [laughs]
>>Erm, so so funny story about

00:32:33.518,00:32:38.523
the bomb for this badge. Er, can
you hand me one? This badge has
one button in the back of it.

00:32:43.261,00:32:48.266
One. And in our fake badge it's
blue. >>You're shitting me,
right? 10 minutes? >>They did

00:32:51.102,00:32:57.642
that on purpose. >>10 minutes?
It's one thirty, okay hurry the
fuck up. Anyway, the button's

00:32:57.642,00:33:01.847
blue, it was ten years ago they
stopped making it, if you want
to buy the white button, the way

00:33:01.847,00:33:05.884
it's supposed to be you have to
pay like twenty bucks a button,
and we're like, no. Anyway,

00:33:05.884,00:33:10.889
Defcon 23. We go radio active on
this stuff. Okay, why would we
do the 23 because "Lost" said it

00:33:13.592,00:33:18.797
was impossible and we already
did the PCV, let's do something
that's not electronic. It'll be

00:33:18.797,00:33:23.802
fun, why not. It's nuclear. Um,
so how'd we do it? We just just,
we wanted the triangles. You

00:33:27.305,00:33:33.478
know, "Lost" said, if you don't,
if you're unfamiliar with last
year's black badge, it is called

00:33:33.478,00:33:39.918
Captured Lightening in a flexi
glass triangle, right, that's
what Jessie's is holding up.

00:33:39.918,00:33:46.258
Beautiful model who's holding
the...er, it's charged with
millions of vaults and then some

00:33:46.258,00:33:51.630
guy, I think Brent, Brett, comes
and hammers it with a nail and
it discharges and it shows

00:33:51.630,00:33:56.635
lightening inside. There's only
one guy in the US that does
this. In the world that does

00:33:59.204,00:34:05.176
this. He holds the patents and
that particular shape and size
of triangle is no longer

00:34:05.176,00:34:11.650
manufactured. That's the picture
from their website and that is,
so the model was 14A and 14,

00:34:11.650,00:34:16.655
this one was the other one they
had, was the same size as the
black badge, but was an inch

00:34:19.858,00:34:26.031
thick, thick. And you don't want
a black badge, it's an inch
thick. You give it to someone,

00:34:26.031,00:34:32.203
who, who's , a goon or DT or
"Lost", "Lost"'s gonna be like:
"what is this shit?" so we have

00:34:32.203,00:34:37.642
to have the original, we need to
have the original triangle,
anything. So I email the guy,

00:34:37.642,00:34:42.647
okay, we gotta do this, we have
to do, we're a bunch of makers
from Portland, er we wanna make

00:34:45.116,00:34:51.823
like triangles that light up
with LEDs, we're, anyone here
seen Portlandia? You gotta email

00:34:51.823,00:34:58.129
him like that, er, we wanna do,
I don't know, a fancy >>We gonna
put birds on it! We're gonna put

00:34:58.129,00:35:03.068
boards on it, and pour beer,
IPAs >>Craft beer >>Craft beer
[sniggers] mini brews. Okay, I'm

00:35:05.670,00:35:10.675
hurrying, I'm hurrying. Um, oh
where am I? Okay so we really
had to have that specific one.

00:35:13.878,00:35:19.884
We had to put in a special
order, the minimum order is, er,
oh good, "Lost" is on his way.

00:35:19.884,00:35:24.089
Er, we had to put a special
order in, so it was like,
minimum order is 10, we were

00:35:24.089,00:35:28.727
like, we're not going to be like
too suspicious. Give us 12.
Because we know we're going to

00:35:28.727,00:35:33.732
fuck up at least one. Um, well,
we guessed as much, and, um,
we're like yeah, okay when is it

00:35:38.870,00:35:44.376
going to be ready ,and we out
the order in at er, September,
and he was going to go to the

00:35:44.376,00:35:49.381
super particle accelerator in
December , okay, we'll wait five
months. Fine, Erm, so an an

00:35:54.552,00:35:59.958
interesting story. During the
email conversation , he's like:
"you know, this specific model

00:35:59.958,00:36:04.963
you're asking for was er used by
this guy at this Defcon
conference and they were doing

00:36:06.965,00:36:11.169
this nuclear crazy stuff, like
check out this link," I'm like:
"Oh wow, that's amazing"

00:36:15.373,00:36:21.913
[laughter]So >>Mickey, was that
nuclear? >>Nook, Nuc, nuclear,
English not my first language.

00:36:21.913,00:36:29.220
>>Okay, okay, just checking >>I
love America. Okay so, I'm
going, I'm going. How did we

00:36:29.220,00:36:35.894
deal with radiation? So, Okay,
I'm I've never done this before.
Ledpig. This is what this is

00:36:35.894,00:36:47.305
called, this thing is like this
big and it weighs a ton. Okay,
go on Ebay. I need a Led

00:36:47.305,00:36:57.248
radiation container. Got it. I
need, um uranium glass dipped
marbles [laughter] I won the bid

00:36:57.248,00:37:04.022
on that one. Um, no like what
else do I need. I need a Giger
counter, okay, "Lost" has a

00:37:04.022,00:37:12.597
Giger counter that cost like a
ga-zillion dollars. I'll show
you a picture later. And I'm

00:37:12.597,00:37:17.102
like, I'm poor, I'm going to go
on Ebay and I'm going to find
the cheapest one I can find, and

00:37:17.102,00:37:26.311
so I'm like okay, it has to be
Russian [laughter] and because
its, Russians are good with

00:37:26.311,00:37:33.585
radiation [laughter] and it has
to be cheap. And so I found one
for like $60 bucks, and I'm

00:37:33.585,00:37:41.659
like, "Oh my god, it's a steal
because this this specific model
is like 250 minimum, like the

00:37:41.659,00:37:48.967
whole length of this is a Giger
tube. And I go, what's the
catch? It has only Russian. The

00:37:48.967,00:37:53.838
interface is only in Russian.
I'm like Okay, I looked online,
and probably the guy's an idiot

00:37:53.838,00:38:04.716
he can't change the language in
the settings, I'll buy it. No.
It's it's hardcoded in Russian.

00:38:04.716,00:38:11.756
Good thing I know Russian,
kinda. But it's really amazing,
when this thing glows red in

00:38:11.756,00:38:20.265
Russian. Like holy shit, um so
we got the uranium marble. I'm
hurrying, I'm hurrying. We've

00:38:20.265,00:38:28.907
got 5 minutes. You're serious?
It's one forty. Um, anyway we
got the uranium marbles, we got

00:38:28.907,00:38:42.453
tritium, "Lost" ordered tritium,
he got it, oh, here's "Lost"!
Hey! [applause] So we have this

00:38:42.453,00:38:49.127
deal. Every year we do the fake
badge we give a copy of it to
DT, one to DT and one to "Lost".

00:38:49.127,00:38:57.669
And he checks the...this one's
for you brother, for you to
check the quality and and , he's

00:38:57.669,00:39:03.908
already wearing a competitor's
black badge >>So these are both
fakes. So I'm going to have a

00:39:03.908,00:39:10.748
battle of the fakes and I'm
gonna see who does the best
forgery. But his guy is awesome.

00:39:10.748,00:39:16.788
[laughter] >>I've got like five
minutes. Okay so, um we got the
tritium, so like okay I'm a

00:39:16.788,00:39:24.829
foreign national in the US and
I'm faking a nuclear black
badge. [laughter] who do I know

00:39:24.829,00:39:32.070
who's a citizen. Dean, you order
the yellow cake uranium. >>Yeah,
you know what I don't give a

00:39:32.070,00:39:40.278
fuck >>Excatly, these guys do
the NSA playset. You're on a
list somewhere. >>Has anyone

00:39:40.278,00:39:48.386
been on United nuclear dot com?
[laughter] anyone know that
website, everyone's a fan.

00:39:48.386,00:39:50.922
[laughter] Has anyone ever
bought anything from it? Yeah,
they accept paypal and they ship

00:39:50.922,00:39:57.362
really quickly and it's like
giant lasers and sorts of crazy
crap, but yeah do... >>I have to

00:39:57.362,00:40:00.098
ask, Mickey, did your tritium
viles come in packaged in fake
coffee packages like mine did?

00:40:00.098,00:40:02.100
>>I,I hoped for it, but er no.
[laughter] but had Jessie
ordered eight of them >>We, we

00:40:02.100,00:40:04.102
need to compare sources then,
because mine came and it was
labelled and they had taken

00:40:04.102,00:40:09.107
coffee and opened it up and
sealed them inside, and so it
looked like I was getting

00:40:17.415,00:40:21.619
filters [laughter] >>We were
like, we're not going to order
from a Columbian drug lord like

00:40:21.619,00:40:26.624
"Lost" [audience laughs] we are
going to, yeah like, Ebay.
Tritium vile. I think it's blue.

00:40:30.561,00:40:35.566
Order. Please don't arrest me,
please don't arrest me. I send
this picture to "Lost" anyway,

00:40:38.436,00:40:43.441
this is the Giger counter, this
is one of the PR pictures you
have had for your badge. And I

00:40:45.877,00:40:50.882
remember zero point three three
eight on the Giger counter for
the real Uber badge. And this on

00:40:53.117,00:40:58.122
the fake, the fake badge and the
Russian Giger counter.
[applause] >>Is that standard or

00:41:04.996,00:41:10.868
metric? >>Yeah, I gotta hurry
up, so er, the coin. The coin
was the biggest challenge here.

00:41:10.868,00:41:15.873
We had to fake the coin. So um,
how do get high res pictures of
the front, the back, front, the

00:41:20.078,00:41:25.083
front again. What do we do?
Muns. MS paint >>MS paint
>>Again. And we get high res, so

00:41:31.189,00:41:37.395
um two things that are
distinctly different in this
one. The font and the back of

00:41:37.395,00:41:42.400
the coin, where I said "fuck it"
I', I've spent months on 22 Uber
fonts, I'm not going to do it

00:41:45.937,00:41:52.410
again and the dick-butt at the
front. >>Did you actually
translate the Korean? Do you

00:41:52.410,00:41:59.150
know it says? >>It is, so, wait
for it, we have a slide for
that. Funny story about Korean.

00:41:59.150,00:42:04.088
So, we got this thing. Anyone,
if you know what Ninegag is,
raise your hand. Awesome. So we

00:42:08.659,00:42:13.664
went on Ninegag. Anybody knows
what this says in Korean?
[audience responds] everyone was

00:42:16.834,00:42:21.839
like, "Oh hey, our supreme
leader," and er one guy said,
"the taffey salesman does

00:42:24.075,00:42:28.112
whatever the fuck he wants"
>>So, it's a Korean proverb, it
says, get junk o so mundro which

00:42:28.112,00:42:32.250
means they guy who sells yet can
do whatever the fuck he wants.
>>Yes, exactly and yet is

00:42:32.250,00:42:37.755
taffey. It's Korean taffey.
>>But it's a double entendre
because you tell someone to go a

00:42:37.755,00:42:43.227
yet, it's like fuck off.
[laughter] >>Exactly, so we try
that and I'm like some guy on

00:42:43.227,00:42:47.331
the internet told me this means
that, I'm like no. anyone I
know, knows anyone who know

00:42:47.331,00:42:52.236
Korean and a co-worker of mine,
Toupher, has a friend who speaks
Korean, so I'm like Toupher, ask

00:42:52.236,00:42:57.208
your friend, but I'm not going
to this thing again where type
into word documents in a Korean

00:42:57.208,00:43:03.781
font and I'm trying to guess,
which combinations of English
letters cause that to look like

00:43:03.781,00:43:10.721
a, look at the top right, the
three and the two. Right, what
is that? I don't know. I don't

00:43:10.721,00:43:15.726
do Korean, and he he sent me the
Korean text in gmail, I was like
copy paste, screw it, um, so

00:43:18.896,00:43:23.901
time. Yeah. We're almost done.
So how did it end up? We found
out a week ago, Jessie sends me

00:43:26.838,00:43:31.843
an email: "there's this guy on
Reddit, " are you here by the
way? Robert? Come here, come

00:43:35.880,00:43:40.885
here. This guy. [applause].
Comes up on Reddit, says: "I
present to you, my Uber badge,"

00:43:46.457,00:43:53.297
and he he he made his own. Which
is awesome. Kudos. Because wow,
I thought it was bigger. This is

00:43:53.297,00:43:55.299
the first time I'm seeing this
>>Yeah, so I didn't know
anything about the badges >>Come

00:43:55.299,00:43:57.301
here >>I didn't know how big the
badge was supposed to be because
I only had a picture of some guy

00:43:57.301,00:44:03.140
holding it. So I assumed that
guy's finger was as big as mine
[laughter] that's why I set the

00:44:03.140,00:44:08.145
CAD scale >>long fingers >>this
is the third time people have
done forgeries, that they're the

00:44:14.418,00:44:19.423
wrong scale based on pictures
like that [laughter] >>But this
is really good. The back of it

00:44:22.693,00:44:27.698
is, is carved as well. This is
really good. >>And then in the
way I did it, the "likenberg"

00:44:30.401,00:44:34.805
figure hacker, however it's
pronounced, two quarter inch
pieces of acryllic, laser

00:44:34.805,00:44:41.078
engraved it ,painted it, er, put
some clear epoxy on it. And then
I just smashed it together with

00:44:41.078,00:44:46.551

assumptions at first >>I got one
bomb to drop on you >>you got
what? >> it's official that no

00:45:48.112,00:45:54.418

the real one versus our fake.
