00:00:00.067,00:00:05.272
>> Good morning, well, I know

00:00:05.272,00:00:09.376
morning. How many of you guys
are hungover? Raise your hand,

00:00:09.376,00:00:13.814
one.. seriously? Only one? Maybe
two? [laughter] You guys are

00:00:13.814,00:00:16.950
doing DefCon wroooong!
[laughter] Okay, no, wait, wait,

00:00:16.950,00:00:20.454
wait... Another drunk... Another
question, how many of are still

00:00:20.454,00:00:27.160
drunk? [laughter] Alright, not
me. I actually got like 6 hours

00:00:27.160,00:00:30.430
of sleep last night which is
f*king fantastic. [ahem]

00:00:30.430,00:00:35.502
Alright, so welcome to "So you
think you wanna be a penetration

00:00:35.502,00:00:41.275
tester". Uhm, my name is Anch,
uh, long story, well short

00:00:41.275,00:00:46.346
story, but, long story about my
handle, I'm not gonna go into.

00:00:46.346,00:00:49.850
Uhm, there's some, some people
that, uh, that I want to

00:00:49.850,00:00:53.453
introduce to you. If you've
noticed there's some logos on my

00:00:53.453,00:00:56.156
slide - I'm a member of a
fantastic organization called

00:00:56.156,00:01:00.460
the security tribe. Uhm, these
guys are all smarter than I am

00:01:00.460,00:01:04.564
and I am super, super happy to
be surrounded by very smart

00:01:04.564,00:01:09.136
people. Uhm, I also had my wife
in the audience and, uh...

00:01:09.136,00:01:15.609
[applause] She's, uh...
[whistling] She's a hacker like

00:01:15.609,00:01:18.445
the rest of us even though she
doesn't admit it she hacks kids

00:01:18.445,00:01:23.684
brains... [laughter] Uhm, she's
a, a university professor and

00:01:23.684,00:01:27.521
she does a fantastic job. Uhm, I
have been a penetration tester

00:01:27.521,00:01:33.327
for 10 years. Uhm, I've lead red
teams for 5 of those 10 years

00:01:33.327,00:01:37.130
and so , uh, I'm gonna talk a
little bit about what the job

00:01:37.130,00:01:42.002
actually is like. Uh, uh, dispel
some misconceptions, let you

00:01:42.002,00:01:44.705
guys know, know a little bit
about what the realities are

00:01:44.705,00:01:50.610
and, uh, such and such. Now, I
have a, a little thing at the

00:01:50.610,00:01:53.113
bottom of this slide that says
"The leprechaun" question

00:01:53.113,00:01:59.219
mark... Now I requested...
[laughter] In my CFP, uh,

00:01:59.219,00:02:03.256
submitted that there would be a
leprechaun dancing on stage...

00:02:05.625,00:02:08.028
while I was giving my talk. And
that didn't happen and I am

00:02:08.028,00:02:11.164
severely disappointed. [pause]
Just kidding. [chuckle] Alright,

00:02:11.164,00:02:16.870
you will notice my slide have a
little bit of humor in them and

00:02:16.870,00:02:20.640
I do that intentionally so feel
free to laugh and... you know.

00:02:20.640,00:02:23.977
[laughter] It's designed to try
to keep you awake. [laughter] So

00:02:23.977,00:02:25.846
let's talk a little bit about
the wonderful world of

00:02:25.846,00:02:32.252
penetration testing. You know
this job is a tough one and I'm

00:02:32.252,00:02:37.157
gonna do a quick survey. How
many in here are already

00:02:37.157,00:02:40.827
penetration testers? Raise your
hands. [pause] Okay, how many in

00:02:40.827,00:02:44.231
here want a job in penetration
testing? Raise your hands.

00:02:47.067,00:02:52.072
[pause] [ahem] Cool, alright...
Now, stand up [pause] if you

00:02:54.474,00:03:01.281
think penetration testing has,
has to do with porn. [laughter]

00:03:01.281,00:03:07.687
What, nobody standing up?
[laughter] That's the, you know,

00:03:07.687,00:03:10.891
you you get into this job just
for the title because it's

00:03:10.891,00:03:14.127
fantastic at parties. [laughter]
People ask you "What do you

00:03:14.127,00:03:16.930
do?", "Well, I'm a penetration
tester." And they give you this

00:03:16.930,00:03:23.070
look of... [laughter] "What the
f*ck is that?" [chuckle] >>

00:03:23.070,00:03:27.874
Exactly... >> Yea, yea. I've had
various answers from "Oh..."

00:03:27.874,00:03:32.145
like, like serious answers "Let
me guess you're the guy to test

00:03:32.145,00:03:37.818
the lighting in pornography,
right?" ... "No" [chuckle]

00:03:37.818,00:03:42.489
[laughter]... "No". Uhm, it's a
fantastic title, it's fun. Uhm,

00:03:42.489,00:03:44.791
it's really cool to explain
because people always ask you

00:03:44.791,00:03:48.595
questions about it. [cough] And
I apologize, I'm getting over

00:03:48.595,00:03:55.068
pneumonia so I'm gonna cough a
little bit. Uhm, so let's talk a

00:03:55.068,00:04:01.408
little bit about what my family
thinks I do... My mom and dad

00:04:01.408,00:04:05.312
seriously think that I'm some
kind of super spy. [audience

00:04:05.312,00:04:08.415
noise] I'm not kidding, like,
they're like "Yeah, you travel

00:04:08.415,00:04:12.486
all over the country and, and
you break into sh*t, and you're

00:04:12.486,00:04:14.554
like James Bond", and I'm like
"No, I'm not..." [laughter]

00:04:14.554,00:04:20.760
"That's actually really fucking
boring". [chuckle] Uh, so I

00:04:20.760,00:04:24.598
wanna talk through some of the,
the misconceptions and

00:04:24.598,00:04:29.603
realities, uh, to kinda dispel
some myths. And, uh, uhm, some

00:04:31.705,00:04:34.074
of you here are already
penetration testers will laugh

00:04:34.074,00:04:36.910
at these cause they're pretty
funny, I think, you know, I

00:04:36.910,00:04:41.915
think I'm funny. [laughter]
[pause] Uhu... [laughter]

00:04:51.391,00:04:53.627
Apparently there are a lot of
people in here that need to get

00:04:53.627,00:04:58.632
laid. [laughter] Uhm,
misconception number one, there

00:05:01.835,00:05:08.208
will always be somebody more
elite than you. We all have

00:05:08.208,00:05:13.013
something to learn. There is
nobody on this planet that is an

00:05:13.013,00:05:17.083
expert on everything. And, uhm,
I talked a little bit earlier

00:05:17.083,00:05:20.787
about surrounding yourself with
some people that are smarter

00:05:20.787,00:05:25.792
than you... [coughing] And, uhm,
my team that I work with is

00:05:25.792,00:05:31.831
super smart. All of these guys
are just fucking geniuses and it

00:05:31.831,00:05:34.301
baffles me sometimes...
[coughing] That they let me hang

00:05:34.301,00:05:40.807
out with them. [pause] [audience
noise] And this fucker down her,

00:05:40.807,00:05:44.144
stand up, Jeremy. [laughter] >>
I'm the leprechaun that was

00:05:44.144,00:05:47.747
supposed to be doing the
dancing. >> He is the leprechaun

00:05:47.747,00:05:54.020
that is supposed to be dancing.
[laughter] [applause] [cheering]

00:05:54.020,00:05:59.059
Catch my lucky charms or I blow
your a** to pieces. [laughter]

00:05:59.059,00:06:03.396
[ahem] Now... >> Can I sit. >>
Yea you can sit. >> Thank you.

00:06:03.396,00:06:05.999
>> Uhm, he is a member of my
team. I'm pretty sure that

00:06:05.999,00:06:09.169
there's more in here, I just
can't see you. If, if you work

00:06:09.169,00:06:14.174
with me stand up... [pause]
Really? [laughter] I guess they

00:06:16.476,00:06:19.779
don't... [laughter] I guess they
don't really want me to hang out

00:06:19.779,00:06:24.784
with them, that kinda sucks.
[laughter] A**holes. [laughter]

00:06:26.953,00:06:31.057
Uhm. [ahem] There's always gonna
be somebody that is more, that

00:06:31.057,00:06:35.495
is better than you at something
else and your job as a part, a

00:06:35.495,00:06:40.200
part of, of, of this job is to
learn from them. You learn all

00:06:40.200,00:06:44.537
you can because you're gonna run
into shit that you have no idea

00:06:44.537,00:06:48.108
what it is and if you can learn
it the first time the next time

00:06:48.108,00:06:51.278
you run into it, you'll know how
to deal with it. So,

00:06:51.278,00:06:54.281
misconception number one - you
will never be the most elite guy

00:06:54.281,00:07:00.920
in the room. [pause] Reality
number two... [laughter] If

00:07:00.920,00:07:03.590
somebody told you this job is
easy money... [laughter] They're

00:07:03.590,00:07:07.093
a f*cking liar! [audience noise]
We work, uhm, well, when we're

00:07:07.093,00:07:10.797
on site, when we're actually
doing an assessment we work

00:07:10.797,00:07:14.067
probably, uhm, between 8 and 10
hours a day. That's pretty easy.

00:07:14.067,00:07:17.003
We travel 25% of the time and,
uhm, we have a good time while

00:07:17.003,00:07:20.206
we're working. When we're not
traveling we're doing research.

00:07:20.206,00:07:25.211
Uhm, we're honing our skills,
we're doing things that...

00:07:35.922,00:07:40.927
[cough] [cough] Excuse me, I'm
sorry. We're doing things that,

00:07:43.029,00:07:48.601
uh, uhm, make use better at your
job and that can take, oh, I

00:07:48.601,00:07:51.871
dunno, it could take 15 hour
days, it could take 10 hour

00:07:51.871,00:07:57.877
days. You know, uhm, my wife
puts up with me so well! Cause

00:07:57.877,00:08:03.717
she'll and I'm like "I'm still
working", and she's like "Uuuh,

00:08:03.717,00:08:07.354
but I thought we were gonna have
dinner". I'm like "Yea, we can

00:08:07.354,00:08:13.526
eat at 9..." [laughter] Uhm, so,
it's not an easy job. It's not

00:08:13.526,00:08:19.699
something you can sit and do...
you know, nothing. I mean, you

00:08:19.699,00:08:22.369
know, it's like "Oh, what do you
do?" , "I surf the internet all

00:08:22.369,00:08:27.374
day.. shhh." [laughter] Uhm
[chuckle] Yeah, I can't do that,

00:08:30.276,00:08:33.947
this is funny. Hold on just a
second. [microphone noise]

00:08:36.282,00:08:41.287
[pause] [laughter] My mom bought
me this shirt... [laughter] And,

00:08:44.391,00:08:49.362
uh, we were, we were out here.
[cough] We were out here on

00:08:49.362,00:08:54.667
Friday, last Friday, a week from
Friday cause we, uhm, we're

00:08:54.667,00:08:59.038
doing human reg and so we helped
prep 'con. And she panicked

00:08:59.038,00:09:02.342
because she saw me check-in in
Vegas and was like "But I had a

00:09:02.342,00:09:07.013
shirt for you to wear at
DefCon!". [chuckle] Okay, it

00:09:07.013,00:09:09.616
says "Penetration" on the front,
if you can't read it. Uhm...

00:09:12.619,00:09:15.422
[laughter] And the back has a
definition of penetration,

00:09:15.422,00:09:22.395
uhm... [laughter] And when your
mother gives you a shirt that

00:09:22.395,00:09:27.400
says "Penetration" on it...
[laughing] It's kinda awkward.

00:09:34.908,00:09:39.112
[laughing] [chuckle] [laughter]
[cough] Not really... My wife

00:09:39.112,00:09:42.649
just asked "Do you want me to
read the back?"... No [chuckle].

00:09:42.649,00:09:47.654
It's kind of, it's awkward....
[laughter] Alright [pause]...

00:09:49.956,00:09:54.294
There's no bullshit in this job.
If you can't read this slide it

00:09:54.294,00:09:57.664
says "If I appear to believe
your bullshit doesn't mean that

00:09:57.664,00:10:01.267
I am as stupid as you think I
am...". [pause] "I'm just

00:10:01.267,00:10:05.071
laughing inside waiting to see
what you came up with..." You

00:10:05.071,00:10:10.810
can't fake it until you make it
in this job, it doesn't work,

00:10:10.810,00:10:15.815
you will crash and burn
miserably. And, uhm,

00:10:18.451,00:10:20.954
unfortunately there's a lot of
people trying to do that in this

00:10:20.954,00:10:25.391
industry and so I will encourage
you if you really gotta have a

00:10:25.391,00:10:28.995
passion for it. Uhm, and we'll
talk a little bit about what

00:10:28.995,00:10:34.334
that passion entails in a little
bit. Uhm, I have seen a lot of

00:10:34.334,00:10:38.037
bullshit in my time. I've seen a
lot of people stand up and say

00:10:38.037,00:10:42.041
"Oh, yea, I can hack into
anything". When you ask them to

00:10:42.041,00:10:45.945
prove it they're like "Oh, wait,
hacking into something is more

00:10:45.945,00:10:49.015
than just pressing start on a
Nessus scan?", "Uhm, yea, it

00:10:49.015,00:10:50.350
is". Uhm, so there's no bullshit
in this job. [pause] [chuckle]

00:10:50.350,00:10:51.684
[laughing] This is my favorite
comment! [cough] Yes, you have

00:10:51.684,00:10:56.689
to have experience to get
experience. Yes, and I'm not

00:11:16.209,00:11:19.178
telling you that you have to be
a penetration tester to be a

00:11:19.178,00:11:24.183
penetration tester, uhm... I
hire, I prefer that we hire

00:11:26.986,00:11:32.625
sysadmins, uhm, it's easy for me
to turn a sysadmin into a

00:11:32.625,00:11:36.963
penetration tester. And that's
because a sysadmin knows how to

00:11:36.963,00:11:42.402
build something and if you know
how to build something you can

00:11:42.402,00:11:47.140
generally take it apart. Uhm...
[laughter] And that's what we do

00:11:47.140,00:11:51.210
- we take things apart! Uh, we
try not to have missing pieces

00:11:51.210,00:11:55.048
at the end... [laughter]
"Where's the.... where the f*ck

00:11:55.048,00:11:58.651
did this screw come from?"
Uhm... but yea, we, we take

00:11:58.651,00:12:03.456
things apart. We analyze it, we
look at it and it's easy for me

00:12:03.456,00:12:07.527
to take a sysadmin who knows how
to put something together and

00:12:07.527,00:12:10.296
teach them the skills that they
need to be able to take things

00:12:10.296,00:12:17.203
apart. Uhm, I also look for an
attitude. [laughter] Uhm, how

00:12:17.203,00:12:21.240
many in here would consider
themselves a hacker? Raise your

00:12:21.240,00:12:24.644
hands. [pause] Every fucking one
of you should be raising your

00:12:24.644,00:12:31.017
hand right now! Let's try that
again... [laughter] How many

00:12:31.017,00:12:35.688
people in here would consider
themselves a hacker? [pause]

00:12:35.688,00:12:40.627
[laughter] Alright, that was
better. We give you a pass on

00:12:40.627,00:12:45.632
that... I give it about a "D",
60%. I'm totally gonna give you

00:12:48.101,00:12:54.040
the "D" later... [laughter] Just
the tip... [laughter] Just to

00:12:54.040,00:12:59.045
see how it feels... [laughter]
[coughing] The mentality of a

00:13:01.347,00:13:07.420
hacker is one that questions
things. That's curious and if

00:13:07.420,00:13:10.690
you're not curious about
something, I mean, and I'm

00:13:10.690,00:13:13.559
not... I'm not talking about a
computer hacker. I'm talking of

00:13:13.559,00:13:16.729
a hacker, if you're not curious
about something you're dead....

00:13:19.265,00:13:23.302
and you need to be revived.
[laughter] And so, I challenge

00:13:23.302,00:13:26.606
everybody in this room who
didn't raise their hand, like, I

00:13:26.606,00:13:31.511
said, there was about 40% of
you... To wake up. [audience

00:13:31.511,00:13:33.846
noise] Get curious about
something. I don't care about

00:13:33.846,00:13:38.151
what it is, it could be
knitting, it can be underwater

00:13:38.151,00:13:44.557
basket-weaving... [pause] It can
be computers, just be curious

00:13:44.557,00:13:48.995
about something, learn...
something. That's how you get

00:13:48.995,00:13:53.032
experience! If you come to me
and say "Hey, I've been a

00:13:53.032,00:13:57.103
sysadmin for 5 years and... this
is what I did and I really wanna

00:13:57.103,00:13:59.839
be a penetration tester". I'm
gonna look at you and say "Cool,

00:13:59.839,00:14:03.376
let's talk about your mindset...
what are you curious about? What

00:14:03.376,00:14:08.948
do you like to do?". You know, I
like computers, actually, I love

00:14:08.948,00:14:11.384
computers, I spend a lot of my
time with computers. I do

00:14:11.384,00:14:16.289
electronics too. [cough] ...you
know, I build stuff. Uhm...

00:14:16.289,00:14:20.193
[coughing] I... build planter
boxes for my wife - carpentry.

00:14:20.193,00:14:23.663
Uhm, I do all kinds of stuff
cause I want to learn. I want to

00:14:23.663,00:14:29.202
exercise my brain. I wanna keep
things elastic and not get

00:14:29.202,00:14:34.207
stale. [pause] [chuckle] You
guys wanna do some penetration

00:14:41.280,00:14:46.285
testing? [pause] [laughter] They
don't pay you to sit around and

00:14:48.921,00:14:53.926
do nothing. [cough] This is
work! It's a job! Uhm, people

00:14:59.432,00:15:04.203
forget that sometimes, I think..
[cough] The get going with a, a

00:15:04.203,00:15:09.642
"Hey, I'm gonna be a hacker! And
I'm gonna hack into things..."

00:15:09.642,00:15:14.614
Which is true but it's also a
job. Uhm, you don't get to just

00:15:14.614,00:15:19.118
show and hack into sh*t and go
away. It's work... And I tucked

00:15:19.118,00:15:23.923
my shirt in just to add that and
I'm gonna tuck my shirt in cause

00:15:23.923,00:15:28.427
it's hot. [pause] Is it hot in
here? [pause] Yea, I'm not gonna

00:15:28.427,00:15:33.399
take off all my clothes.
[laughter] Uhm, so remember,

00:15:33.399,00:15:36.302
they're not paying you to do
nothing, they're paying you to

00:15:36.302,00:15:39.505
actually do work and we're gonna
talk a little bit about what

00:15:39.505,00:15:42.742
that work is. And, uhm...
[audience noise] What you're

00:15:42.742,00:15:46.078
clients are gonna expect from
you, and what you're gonna have

00:15:46.078,00:15:51.083
to be able to do in order to, to
a penetration tester. [pause] I

00:15:57.190,00:16:00.660
love the Kim Jong Il memes,
they're so funny! [audience

00:16:02.728,00:16:05.565
noise] So how many of you in
here think they know what a "Red

00:16:05.565,00:16:11.370
Team" is? Raise your hand...
[pause] Okay, I know you do...

00:16:11.370,00:16:14.807
[laughter] Uhm... I know you do.
Keep your hands raised, I might

00:16:14.807,00:16:20.046
call on somebody. [laughter]
Uh... you stand up. Shout loud.

00:16:20.046,00:16:26.285
[pause] You... good. >> A red
team is a group of individuals

00:16:26.285,00:16:32.525
that work with, uhm, trying to
break into a company their

00:16:32.525,00:16:35.528
security or, information
security. >> That's pretty good.

00:16:35.528,00:16:38.831
Okay, he said "A red team is a
group of individuals that work

00:16:38.831,00:16:41.467
with, trying to break into a
company their physical security

00:16:41.467,00:16:46.472
or, uh, information security."
Pretty close, uhm... I'm gonna

00:16:48.808,00:16:55.481
tell you the definitions differ
vastly between organizations.

00:16:55.481,00:17:02.421
[pause] In my line of work, in
my organization the red team is

00:17:02.421,00:17:05.725
simply an announced assessment.
[pause] Now, there's more to it

00:17:05.725,00:17:09.295
than that, it just means that
we're not gonna tell IT we're

00:17:09.295,00:17:12.865
coming when we come to penetrate
them... [laughter] [coughing]

00:17:12.865,00:17:17.870
Over and over and over again...
[pause] [coughing] A red team

00:17:25.711,00:17:29.548
activity is very different to a
penetration test and kinda wanna

00:17:29.548,00:17:34.253
walk through some definitions
here, uh, as we, just kinda

00:17:34.253,00:17:37.890
level set what we're talking
about. So I'm gonna start out

00:17:37.890,00:17:41.928
with vulnerability assessment. A
lot of people, a lot of

00:17:41.928,00:17:44.897
companies out there, big
companies and I'm not gonna name

00:17:44.897,00:17:48.734
any names... [cough]
"Wallace"... Oh, sorry...

00:17:48.734,00:17:52.038
[pause] Call, uhm, a penetration
test of... call a vulnerability

00:17:52.038,00:17:55.708
assessment a penetration test.
You're not actually doing a

00:17:55.708,00:17:58.311
penetration test unless you're
trying to actively exploit

00:17:58.311,00:18:03.249
vulnerabilities. If you walk in
with NESSES and MAP, old ones,

00:18:06.519,00:18:11.691
SAINT... uhm, "SATAN". Who here
knows what SATAN is? Raise,

00:18:11.691,00:18:15.695
raise your hand. [pause] Yes!
[chuckle] I love SATAN's, best

00:18:15.695,00:18:20.299
tool ever. I wish it still
existed, well it does but they

00:18:20.299,00:18:25.771
don't call it SATAN anymore.
Uhm... [pause] If you walk in

00:18:25.771,00:18:31.010
with one of those tools.
[coughing] Hit the button, spit

00:18:31.010,00:18:35.615
out a report and hand it to your
client - you did NOT perform a

00:18:35.615,00:18:40.820
penetration test. You performed
a vulnerability assessment. And,

00:18:40.820,00:18:43.356
you know, there's more, you can
add more to that. You could add

00:18:43.356,00:18:46.792
a threat assessment on top of
that. Uhm, but if you did not

00:18:46.792,00:18:49.929
try to exploit the
vulnerabilities that you found

00:18:49.929,00:18:53.099
and tried to dig deeper - you
did not perform a penetration

00:18:53.099,00:18:58.637
test. [pause] Penetration test
like I said... [cough] Is

00:18:58.637,00:19:03.042
something that you take your
vulnerability assessment and you

00:19:03.042,00:19:06.312
try to take it one step further.
You gonna try to actually

00:19:06.312,00:19:10.383
exploit the vuln, the
vulnerabilities. Now, when you

00:19:10.383,00:19:13.386
exploit those [ahem] [cough]
you're gonna take it and see how

00:19:13.386,00:19:16.889
far the rabbit hole goes.
[pause] A rabbit hole typically

00:19:16.889,00:19:22.028
goes pretty damn far... Uhm...
[laughter] That's the fun part!

00:19:22.028,00:19:26.732
...of this job. The boring part
is waiting for the vulnerability

00:19:26.732,00:19:31.737
assessments to come back. Now...
red teams. Red teams are the

00:19:34.673,00:19:39.078
most fun, in my opinion. They're
the thing that everybody wants

00:19:39.078,00:19:44.083
to do but not everybody can do
it. A red team differs largely

00:19:46.886,00:19:51.357
in the aspect of a penetration
test in that you're trying not

00:19:51.357,00:19:56.695
to get caught. A penetration
tests are loud! You're gonna get

00:19:56.695,00:19:59.331
caught all over the place,
you're gonna sit down with your

00:19:59.331,00:20:01.100
client. they're gonna know that
you're there. They're going to

00:20:01.100,00:20:04.970
treat you like auditors by the
way. Uhm, do we have any

00:20:04.970,00:20:10.943
auditors in the room? [laughing]
We have one, I'm sorry.

00:20:10.943,00:20:13.512
[laughing] Uhm, we're, we're
going to, they're going to,

00:20:13.512,00:20:15.881
they're gonna treat you like an
auditor. They're gonna hide

00:20:15.881,00:20:18.117
things from you, they're gonna
do all kinds of sh*t. We will

00:20:18.117,00:20:23.656
talk about that in a little bit.
[cough] [ahem] You, you really,

00:20:23.656,00:20:26.192
you know, you wanna take it to
the next level and so you wanna

00:20:26.192,00:20:29.228
keep digging until you can dig
no more. And in the red team

00:20:29.228,00:20:31.831
you're gonna do that same
digging, you're gonna do it from

00:20:31.831,00:20:37.603
outside, you're gonna do it
from... [pause] As sneaky as

00:20:37.603,00:20:40.106
possible, whether you're
breaking into something, you

00:20:40.106,00:20:42.875
know, physically you're jumping
the fence; you planted a device;

00:20:42.875,00:20:45.911
you're doing social engineering,
you know... Those are the kinds

00:20:45.911,00:20:49.381
of concepts that differ between
a red team and a penetration

00:20:49.381,00:20:54.386
test. At least where I'm at
right now. [pause] Let's talk a

00:20:58.958,00:21:03.729
little bit about ada,
adaptation. How many of you guys

00:21:03.729,00:21:08.734
like to plan... let's just say,
plan your day? [pause] [chatter]

00:21:10.870,00:21:14.640
Alright... You put two hands up,
I know. You really wanna throw a

00:21:14.640,00:21:19.578
monkey wrench in an encryp's
life? [chuckle] Toss him

00:21:19.578,00:21:23.382
something that's not gonna fit
in his day... [laughter] Cause

00:21:23.382,00:21:25.885
he will try and make it fit and
it'll be FUNNY! [laughter] Uhm,

00:21:25.885,00:21:30.890
no.. you're gonna have to adapt.
You're gonna have to think on

00:21:33.526,00:21:37.363
your feet. Uhm, how many of you
guys were up here Lost's talk?

00:21:37.363,00:21:41.901
Kuwait talk on Thursday? I know
I was. You know, he talked a bit

00:21:41.901,00:21:45.404
about, he gave this whole speech
about thinking outside the box,

00:21:45.404,00:21:51.844
right? I like to talk about
non-linear thinking. You can't

00:21:51.844,00:21:55.247
think in a straight line, if you
think "this" lead to "this"

00:21:55.247,00:21:59.118
leads to "this" you're never
going to find everything you

00:21:59.118,00:22:04.056
need to find. [chatter] Oh, he's
getting trashed? Nice... well,

00:22:06.525,00:22:10.129
okay, I'm not gonna wait for him
cause I have a limited amount of

00:22:10.129,00:22:14.867
time. [pause] [cough] Okay! So,
yea, we're gonna talk about

00:22:14.867,00:22:19.405
adaptation. Your role in, you
know... [pause] Oh! Hi...

00:22:21.740,00:22:26.745
[background noise] Ladies and
gentlemen... Lost! [applause] I

00:22:28.781,00:22:34.820
know... I know that there's a
very good reason that you're

00:22:34.820,00:22:37.856
late. But I do that to everybody
who comes late to my talks,

00:22:37.856,00:22:42.861
so... [laughter] Uhm, so, so
yea. One plus one might equal

00:22:47.399,00:22:51.303
five and the reason why is
because you think it equals

00:22:51.303,00:22:54.406
"two" but there's three more
things out here that the client

00:22:54.406,00:22:58.777
hasn't told you about. So,
really it's not "one plus one"

00:22:58.777,00:23:03.916
it's "one plus four". [pause] So
you have to learn to adapt, you

00:23:03.916,00:23:08.220
have to learn to sit down and be
like "Oh, well so I didn't think

00:23:08.220,00:23:11.190
about that so I'm gonna take a
step here then I'm gonna

00:23:11.190,00:23:17.963
shift..." A lot of people call
that a "pivot". [background

00:23:17.963,00:23:22.568
noise]. So, learn to adapt, be
flexible, don't think linear and

00:23:22.568,00:23:27.039
gonna really spin things up a
little, speed things up a little

00:23:27.039,00:23:30.843
bit cause I'm gonna start
running out of time. So...

00:23:30.843,00:23:35.014
[pause] We all like to win. How
many of you guys like to win?

00:23:35.014,00:23:39.885
Raise your hand... [pause]
Again? Geez... We're gonna try

00:23:39.885,00:23:44.490
that one more time... I'm trying
to get people up to wake up and

00:23:44.490,00:23:49.495
get active because I realize
it's early... on a Sunday. >> Or

00:23:52.197,00:23:54.633
late Saturday... >> Or late
Saturday... [laughter] Is it

00:23:54.633,00:24:00.272
late Saturday for you? I'm
sorry... [chuckle] [laughter]

00:24:00.272,00:24:02.308
You know, I'll, I'll let you
sleep. There's a nice and

00:24:02.308,00:24:04.610
comfortable spot up here, you
can lie down behind the table

00:24:04.610,00:24:11.383
and take a nap. Uhm... No! We
all like to win, uhm, my team

00:24:11.383,00:24:16.021
especially likes to win, we like
to break into things and say,

00:24:16.021,00:24:20.492
"Yes, we win!". [laughter] But,
I want to take the concept of

00:24:20.492,00:24:27.366
winning out of this. Everybody
needs to win. Your client needs

00:24:27.366,00:24:31.170
to be as secure as possible,
your job is to come in and tell

00:24:31.170,00:24:34.640
them where they're not secure.
Not come in and embarrass their

00:24:34.640,00:24:39.645
sysadmins. [pause] That's a
bonus! [laughter] [chuckle]

00:24:45.384,00:24:48.020
[pause] I'm gonna get
water-poisoning, by the way,

00:24:48.020,00:24:51.991
Lost. No, I've got about half of
that left, tht's great, thanks.

00:24:51.991,00:24:57.062
Uhm, so yea... so you're just
isn't to embarrass sysadmin,

00:24:57.062,00:25:01.834
your job is to tell your client
where they're weak and what they

00:25:01.834,00:25:06.705
could do to improve. And, so,
take winning out of the

00:25:06.705,00:25:12.277
equation, you know, you don't
get to "win", you get to "help".

00:25:12.277,00:25:16.849
You're not there to, to conquer
the network you're there to

00:25:16.849,00:25:20.919
assess it, you're there to
assist, who you're there...

00:25:20.919,00:25:24.323
you're there to assist your
client in making themselves as

00:25:24.323,00:25:29.328
secure as possible. [pause] Oh
my G*d... the report... [pause]

00:25:35.000,00:25:40.406
How many of you like to write?
[pause] Ooh, a fair amount. How

00:25:40.406,00:25:44.243
many of you are technical
writers? ... In this room?

00:25:44.243,00:25:48.914
[pause] Good! Thank you. I'm
gonna thank you right now, uhm,

00:25:48.914,00:25:53.919
I actually, I hate to write. I
hate it. It's my least favorite

00:25:56.422,00:26:00.058
thing... Uhm, but I do it. And
I've been told that I'm quite

00:26:00.058,00:26:05.230
good at it. [background noise]
Uhm... It's a damn good thing I

00:26:05.230,00:26:10.135
married an english teacher.
[laughing] Oh my God... [pause]

00:26:10.135,00:26:15.140
You shouldn't tweet without,
her, without her look at it

00:26:17.776,00:26:23.315
first. [laughter] [chuckle] And
he wasn't kidding! [laughter]

00:26:23.315,00:26:26.952
[cough] Seriously, she helps me
a lot. Uhm, she corrects my

00:26:26.952,00:26:32.591
grammar a lot. Uh, she has a
large red pen and I love it!

00:26:32.591,00:26:36.628
[laughter] Uhm, learn to write,
learn to write well. You're

00:26:36.628,00:26:41.733
gonna have to do it. Uhm, my
last report was... [pause]

00:26:41.733,00:26:46.705
[chuckle] Can you tell... can
you tell who I worked on it

00:26:46.705,00:26:50.242
with? Crypt, Cryptonite wrote
this report. It took us, what,

00:26:50.242,00:26:53.912
th, three weeks? Was it three
and a half weeks are right?

00:26:53.912,00:26:58.917
[pause] Why is... PTSD. Uhm,
yea, it was long. [cough] And

00:27:00.919,00:27:05.224
it's detailed, because again,
you have a job to do. Your job

00:27:05.224,00:27:09.094
is to make sure your client
knows where they're weak and you

00:27:09.094,00:27:11.964
wanna, you also wanna make sure
that you're telling them how

00:27:11.964,00:27:16.568
they can make themselves better.
So... the report is important.

00:27:19.037,00:27:24.042
[pause] And the client...
[pause] Let's talk a little bit

00:27:27.446,00:27:32.584
about how you interface with
your client. First thing you're

00:27:32.584,00:27:36.054
gonna do when you get on site is
you're gonna sit down and you're

00:27:36.054,00:27:39.525
gonna say "Hey, plug me into
the network" And they're gonna

00:27:39.525,00:27:43.862
look at you and go "Are you
fucking nuts?". [laughter] And

00:27:43.862,00:27:46.298
you're gonna go "Seriously, plug
me into your network". So then

00:27:46.298,00:27:48.700
they plug you in and they're
gonna give you this ream of

00:27:48.700,00:27:52.604
paper that's about... I dunno
ooh, 500 pages long, cause like

00:27:52.604,00:27:56.008
it's, that's technically a ream,
right? And they're gonna say

00:27:56.008,00:28:00.946
"This is the exclusion list"...
[laughter] And it's gonna have

00:28:03.949,00:28:08.186
an IP address on each line for
500 pages. Now you're gonna look

00:28:08.186,00:28:10.656
at this and go "Okay, do you
have this in electronic form?"

00:28:10.656,00:28:16.695
and they're gonna go "No...".
[laughter] Remember how I said

00:28:16.695,00:28:19.031
they're treating you like an
auditor? They don't want you to

00:28:19.031,00:28:25.170
get started... Uhm, so your job
as penetration tester, when you

00:28:25.170,00:28:30.842
come into a client is to make
them feel comfortable. [pause]

00:28:30.842,00:28:37.082
Shhhh... does this smell like
chloroform? [laughter] You make

00:28:37.082,00:28:40.352
them feel comfortable and then
you do what you're gonna do

00:28:40.352,00:28:44.823
which is A: you're gonna find
their weaknesses and then when

00:28:44.823,00:28:48.193
you find their weaknesses you're
gonna show them how to fix them.

00:28:48.193,00:28:51.730
And the more you do that the
more your client will trust you

00:28:51.730,00:28:56.001
and the less that exclusion list
will become a factor. Your job

00:28:56.001,00:28:59.204
is to convince the client that
you need to look at every single

00:28:59.204,00:29:03.642
IP-address on that exclusion
list. [pause] And it's not

00:29:03.642,00:29:07.079
because... again, you wanna
embarrass the sysadmins, that's

00:29:07.079,00:29:12.651
a bonus, remember? [background
noise] Uhm... oh, teleprompter

00:29:12.651,00:29:19.324
went out... I didn't even bring
my mp [00:29:17] ... [pause]

00:29:19.324,00:29:23.595
Oh... that's a bummer. I like
messing with that. I like

00:29:23.595,00:29:28.433
watching my words... oh well.
[cough] [pause] I'm gonna be

00:29:28.433,00:29:30.836
like Rommer, hopefully they will
catch up to me... fuck, fuck,

00:29:30.836,00:29:35.841
fuck, fuck, f*ck... [laughter]
Anyway... so, yea. Your job is

00:29:40.078,00:29:42.214
to, is to make the client feel
comfortable and they're going to

00:29:42.214,00:29:45.751
try and change things. You know,
they don't like the report

00:29:45.751,00:29:52.090
Uh... you said you hacked into
this, did you really do that?

00:29:52.090,00:29:56.862
Can we say that you almost got
in ﻿﻿[laughing] [background

00:29:56.862,00:30:00.065
noise] "Uhm, we have a plan to
mitigate that vulnerability. Can

00:30:00.065,00:30:04.069
we just not write that in the
report?". Uhm, that was my...

00:30:04.069,00:30:10.642
that was my favorite one. "Can,
can we... If I provide you email

00:30:10.642,00:30:15.480
evidence that we're working on
that... [laughing] Uhm, can we

00:30:15.480,00:30:19.317
say that vulnerability didn't
actually exist?". "Uh, no... no,

00:30:19.317,00:30:24.423
no, no." [chuckle] [laughter]
"Yea, no. That's not how...

00:30:24.423,00:30:28.193
that's not how this works.". "I
gotta friend you...". [laughter]

00:30:28.193,00:30:34.633
[pause] At least I got some
laughs... Okay they will test

00:30:34.633,00:30:39.638
you, the point is. You need to
be able to deal with people.

00:30:44.676,00:30:48.313
[pause] You need to be able to
answer questions in a diplomatic

00:30:48.313,00:30:52.017
way instead of saying "No,
you're a fucking idiot, stop

00:30:52.017,00:30:56.855
that!" [laughter] Just don't use
the word "fuck", like you'll say

00:30:56.855,00:31:03.361
"You're an idiot, stop that!".
[laughter] Kay? I realized that

00:31:03.361,00:31:07.299
was kind of a rambling talk and
I appreciate you guys sitting

00:31:07.299,00:31:09.134
and listening to me...
[laughter] Now I'm gonna give

00:31:09.134,00:31:13.538
time for some questions. And I
will answer anything if you will

00:31:13.538,00:31:18.009
guys have questions. Just stand
up and say.. yea. >> Uhm, do you

00:31:18.009,00:31:21.980
have uh, clients or are the
mostly one-off things? Or do you

00:31:21.980,00:31:25.250
have to bring, like, big
companies? What exactly are your

00:31:25.250,00:31:29.921
clients like? >> Uh, right now I
work for one large client and

00:31:29.921,00:31:35.494
uh, we do all of the, uh, the
penetration tests for that on

00:31:35.494,00:31:41.333
client. Next? Yea. >> So, you
mentioned that you like to hire

00:31:41.333,00:31:45.270
sysadmins. I was wondering, you
know, sysadmins what about

00:31:45.270,00:31:49.674
networking? What would you
recommend in terms of, you know,

00:31:49.674,00:31:51.977
sysadmins. >> Oh yea.. The
questions was that... [laughter]

00:31:51.977,00:31:55.614
That I, I, I hire sysadmins,
he's like, "Well, what about

00:31:55.614,00:31:57.249
network guys?" Those two?
[laughter] >> Just two, just

00:31:57.249,00:31:58.984
finish that one. >> I'm just
looking for somebody with

00:31:58.984,00:32:01.553
experience who can build...
[laughter] [chatter] Alright, so

00:32:01.553,00:32:05.190
we're gonna uh... Yea, it's
about time. Yea, I'm like 4

00:32:05.190,00:32:08.827
minutes early, but that's okay.
[laughter] [background noise]

00:32:08.827,00:32:12.831
Fine, leave me, yea. [chatter]
>> Uh, what do you think about

00:32:12.831,00:32:14.966
pen testing certifications?
[laughter] >> What do I think

00:32:14.966,00:32:18.003
about... what do I think of pen
testing certifications?

00:32:20.238,00:32:26.912
[chatter] [sigh] They're all
sh*t! [laughter] Uhm, no,

00:32:26.912,00:32:29.614
seriously. [chatter]
Certifications, letters after

00:32:29.614,00:32:35.053
your name, that's HR filter,
okay? You have to get passed HR

00:32:35.053,00:32:39.324
at some point so you're gonna
need them. Uh, I don't generally

00:32:39.324,00:32:42.961
look at them. I will actually
give you a test if you're gonna

00:32:42.961,00:32:47.465
come work for me... Uhm, I have
a, I have a test that I give and

00:32:47.465,00:32:51.369
if you can... you know, I'm not
looking for if you can pass the

00:32:51.369,00:32:56.141
test, I'm looking for how you
approach the test, alright?

00:32:56.141,00:32:58.443
[background noise] Any others?
[pause] Just stand up and start

00:32:58.443,00:33:02.814
shouting. >> Yea, so what
happens on a pentest if, if you

00:33:02.814,00:33:05.517
come across an existing
compromise? >> What happens on a

00:33:05.517,00:33:08.186
pentest if I come across an
existing compromise? >> Yea...

00:33:08.186,00:33:11.890
>> That's what we call, an, an
"all-stop moment". Everything

00:33:11.890,00:33:16.528
stops at that moment, uhm, and
the we help the client... uhm,

00:33:16.528,00:33:21.199
uh, troubleshoot it and do the
incident response. Yea...

00:33:21.199,00:33:24.369
that's... we don't, we don't
mess around with that shit.

00:33:24.369,00:33:28.874
[background] Anything else?
Anybody want to...? Yip? >> Have

00:33:28.874,00:33:33.945
you dealt with openstack and
existing vulnerabilities on open

00:33:33.945,00:33:36.848
stack? >> Specific
vulnerabilities in open stack?

00:33:36.848,00:33:41.519
Uhm, come grab me at the bar,
we'll talk. [coughing] Kay..

00:33:41.519,00:33:46.524
Yea? >> So, you were mentioning
about working for uhm...

00:33:54.766,00:33:56.101
[coughing] [indistinct] >> Yea,
I get your question, I'm just

00:33:56.101,00:34:00.171
gonna rephrase it a bit. Uhm, so
the question was, uh, what am I,

00:34:00.171,00:34:03.174
basically, what am I actually
looking for in somebody's built

00:34:03.174,00:34:07.012
systems, right? So what if I'm a
potential employee, I'm looking

00:34:07.012,00:34:10.282
for somebody that has the
background in building systems,

00:34:10.282,00:34:13.785
whether it be operating systems,
networks, switching and routing,

00:34:13.785,00:34:17.122
stuff like that. Cause that
stuff, that, that level of

00:34:17.122,00:34:21.559
experience is hard to teach a
penetration tester because if

00:34:21.559,00:34:26.031
you don't have that background
you're not, you're not gonna get

00:34:26.031,00:34:30.101
it - penetration testing. Uhm,
you're not, you're not gonna

00:34:30.101,00:34:33.071
have that depth of something,
you know, when you walk in and

00:34:33.071,00:34:36.541
see "Oh, that switch is
configured wrong", right? There

00:34:36.541,00:34:40.545
a lot of penetration testers out
there that can tell that but I'm

00:34:40.545,00:34:43.648
not gonna hire network guys, I'm
not just gonna hire just

00:34:43.648,00:34:47.552
sysadmins - I'm gonna try and
hire a breath across the team so

00:34:47.552,00:34:52.824
that we have, you know, no one,
compart, there's no one wealth

00:34:52.824,00:34:58.263
of knowledge and we're lacking
somewhere else. That make sense?

00:34:58.263,00:35:00.899
[pause] You? Oh, wait! Stop...
[pause] This is my

00:35:00.899,00:35:05.937
brother-in-law. [laughter] I'm
not shitting you. He's a ginger,

00:35:05.937,00:35:10.442
but he does have a soul...
[laughter] All right, so other

00:35:10.442,00:35:17.115
than Satan, what is your most
useful tool? >> My useful tool..

00:35:17.115,00:35:20.785
my own mind. But we go into that
because you're my brother in

00:35:20.785,00:35:25.790
law... [laughter] [chuckle]
Different context.. Yea, we

00:35:29.627,00:35:35.667
won't go into that. Uhm, [ahem]
You know I have a huge lab at

00:35:35.667,00:35:41.439
home that I use a lot and I use
it to learn. I actually have a

00:35:41.439,00:35:46.745
gigantic lab and that lab is
used for me... [pause] Yea,

00:35:46.745,00:35:52.550
yea... he's a... "Thoughtful
pause". Uhm, yea that lab is

00:35:52.550,00:35:57.022
use, useful for me to, to, to do
my educational things. Right, a

00:35:57.022,00:36:00.392
couple more.... and then we'll
be done. >> Uh, when you're on a

00:36:00.392,00:36:04.396
team, uh, what sort of
mitigation do you use, uh, when

00:36:04.396,00:36:08.066
working inside the networks? Do
you use structures that you

00:36:08.066,00:36:12.437
bring in or do you... >> Yea,
yea, what, what kind of

00:36:12.437,00:36:16.074
infrastructure do we bring into,
into an analyses exploit?

00:36:16.074,00:36:19.978
[cough] We actually have a
server and a switch, we use IRSP

00:36:19.978,00:36:24.716
so communicate which we use, uh,
locally, uhm, we don't wanna,

00:36:24.716,00:36:28.753
uh, communicate outside with
IRC. [background noise] No

00:36:28.753,00:36:31.990
GoogleDocs... [laughter] Lost
has a question... >> I know you

00:36:31.990,00:36:35.260
require a lot of script building
when you're pentesting, I'd just

00:36:35.260,00:36:38.730
like to know if level 5 script
kitty is necessary? >> I am a

00:36:38.730,00:36:44.235
level 5 script kitty. [chuckle]
Uhm, no, you need to learn to

00:36:44.235,00:36:50.408
program in something. Uhm,
Python, Ruby - Ruby's a good one

00:36:50.408,00:36:53.278
because you can write exploit
modules, those are always fun.

00:36:53.278,00:36:58.283
Uhm, yea... that, that's
important too. Yea. >> How do

00:37:00.785,00:37:05.790
you find job opportunity, it
never seems unjust... >> That's

00:37:08.359,00:37:15.166
a tough one... Come here, talk
to people, seriously, uhm, uh,

00:37:15.166,00:37:18.069
he's asking how you get
pentesting job opportunities?

00:37:18.069,00:37:21.406
You come here and you talk to
people; you sit at the bar and

00:37:21.406,00:37:26.845
you, you, you be outgoing enough
to sit down and talk to somebody

00:37:26.845,00:37:30.882
about what you do and what you
would like to do. Uhm...

00:37:30.882,00:37:33.485
[background noise] What was
that? [audience noise] DefCon

00:37:33.485,00:37:40.058
groups, that's another good one.
[audience noise] What was that?

00:37:40.058,00:37:43.161
>> Local meetups! >> Yea... your
local meetups too are great.

00:37:43.161,00:37:48.933
Uhm, those are awesome answers.
Alright, anything else?

00:37:48.933,00:37:54.172
[background noise] >> Yea... >>
I am a auditor so I know like

00:37:54.172,00:37:59.410
when the're an investigation the
auditors simply don't say that

00:37:59.410,00:38:03.548
there's an investigation.
They'll say like, they'll use

00:38:03.548,00:38:09.821
other language and just like...
>> Yea... >> So I was just

00:38:09.821,00:38:14.559
wonder what kind of language
your team's using to

00:38:14.559,00:38:16.961
describe...? So, the, the
question was what kind of

00:38:16.961,00:38:21.466
language we use to describe
ourselves in our reviews to the,

00:38:21.466,00:38:25.170
uh, to the sight. We, yes, we do
a very similar things, we make,

00:38:25.170,00:38:29.240
we make softer claims "This is
an assessment..." for instance

00:38:29.240,00:38:34.245
"It's a review...", we, we do a
"Cybersecurity review...".

00:38:36.548,00:38:39.884
[cough] We don't generally do
incident response... So, uh, we,

00:38:39.884,00:38:41.252
we, we're coming in to actually
do an assessment of, of the

00:38:41.252,00:38:42.587
network itself. Uhm, yea, we
use, we do soften things, you

00:38:42.587,00:38:47.592
know, I can come in and say "I'm
coming to f*ck your sh*t up...".

00:38:55.900,00:38:59.771
All those fun times I'd like
to... alright, that's Crypt. >>

00:38:59.771,00:39:04.709
What would you say is the best
starting point for someone? What

00:39:07.612,00:39:13.551
are the most important
fundamentals? [indistinct]

00:39:13.551,00:39:15.253
[background noise] > Okay,
fantastic question, what's a

00:39:15.253,00:39:17.422
good starting point if you've
never touched a computer but

00:39:17.422,00:39:23.561
really wanna get here? The
fundamentals... it's a tough

00:39:23.561,00:39:29.000
question. Learn how the computer
works. Learn how it works - take

00:39:29.000,00:39:32.670
it apart, put it back together
again, it's hard to do with, you

00:39:32.670,00:39:36.774
know, you know, the computers
these days...but do it. Build

00:39:36.774,00:39:42.180
one from scratch. Take Lost's
"How to build a processor in 10

00:39:42.180,00:39:46.651
minutes". [chuckle ]Watch that!
[background noise] That was

00:39:46.651,00:39:51.856
fucking phenomenal! [laughter]
Seriously, it was! Uh, and, and

00:39:51.856,00:39:55.793
the secret is he that all off
the cuff. That shows you guys

00:39:55.793,00:39:59.230
how smart he is... Right, last
question. >> Uhm, how do yow

00:39:59.230,00:40:03.668
prepare your reports so that you
don't sound like an indictment

00:40:03.668,00:40:06.804
against the staff? >> Very
carefully. I'm going to repeat

00:40:06.804,00:40:11.342
the question: "How do I repair,
how do I prepare my report so it

00:40:11.342,00:40:16.014
doesn't sound like an indictment
against the staff..." The...

00:40:16.014,00:40:21.853
[laughter] Yea... No shit, I
call my wife. Uhm, we actually

00:40:21.853,00:40:27.191
have, uhm, a set of people that
look at the reports and so we'll

00:40:27.191,00:40:30.828
write, we'll write the report
and it'll go through a review

00:40:30.828,00:40:34.799
board and they will tell us if
we're being too harsh or not...

00:40:34.799,00:40:38.503
Uhm, but we, we just carefully
select our language, you know,

00:40:38.503,00:40:43.508
uhm, I'm trying to get us, as an
industry, away from softening

00:40:48.579,00:40:52.617
things too much. I think we are
too soft on our clients, you

00:40:52.617,00:40:58.656
know, you can't sit here and say
"Weeeell... that's a really,

00:40:58.656,00:41:02.527
that's a critical vulnerability
but, maybe, maybe you should

00:41:02.527,00:41:07.065
take care of that..." You
know... [cough] You're not gonna

00:41:07.065,00:41:09.801
go in and say "This is a huge
f*ckup and you f*cked up and you

00:41:09.801,00:41:14.672
need to be fired." But you're
gonna go in and say uhm "This is

00:41:14.672,00:41:19.610
a critical vulnerability, you
need to prioritize this in your,

00:41:19.610,00:41:24.816
in your break fix system." And
so, you know, you just, i think

00:41:24.816,00:41:29.153
we're too soft to be honest and
so I'm trying us not soften the

00:41:29.153,00:41:34.158
language as much as we soften it
now. Alright guys, this is all

00:41:38.329,00:41:43.901
the time I have... [applause] I
will be downstairs at the end of

00:41:43.901,00:41:46.871
the elevator for about 30
minutes, alright, in the

00:41:46.871,00:41:49.507
escalator at the bar for about
30 minutes if you guys wanna

00:41:49.507,00:41:54.512
catch up with me. [background
noise] Oh, yea... I need a

00:41:57.949,00:41:58.216
drink.
