00:00:00.200-->00:00:05.205
>>I want to introduce Kim Zetter
who's going to do the Mr. Robot
panel, thank you! >>Okay uh it's

00:00:13.347-->00:00:16.817
good that we're at the end of
the session, or at the end of
the day here in case we run off

00:00:16.817-->00:00:22.222
a little longer um unfortunately
we don't have any clips for you
uh we wanted to put some of

00:00:22.222-->00:00:25.959
those together and maybe show
you some of the hacks and
products as they were developed

00:00:25.959-->00:00:31.064
but this kind of came together
on short notice last minute so
we don't have that but we do

00:00:31.064-->00:00:35.402
have a great panel of experts
here who are going to answer all
of your technical questions

00:00:35.402-->00:00:40.741
except anything that involves a
spoiler um I'm going to just uh
I'm going to introduce the panel

00:00:40.741-->00:00:44.645
uh I'll go through some
questions but we definitely want
this to be interactive we want

00:00:44.645-->00:00:50.951
all of you guys to feel free um
I can give you sort of a signal
when we're going to be getting

00:00:50.951-->00:00:55.889
ready to take audience questions
and we definitely want your
questions so um you all know

00:00:55.889-->00:01:00.360
that we're in here for the Mr.
Robot panel right? [cheering]
okay I just wanted to make sure

00:01:00.360-->00:01:05.766
you're in the right place um
okay so I was talking with Kor I
don't know if I need to give you

00:01:05.766-->00:01:12.105
like a summary of the show,
right? You all know the show
right? Okay, great alright so

00:01:12.105-->00:01:15.742
I'm just going to introduce the
panelists then and you guys
aren't in the order that I

00:01:15.742-->00:01:21.114
thought you were going to be in
so well Kor's in the center so
why don't we start with Kor, so

00:01:21.114-->00:01:25.953
we've got Kor Adana in the blue
checked shirt there Kor is a
writer and tech producer of Mr.

00:01:25.953-->00:01:30.724
Robot um but he actually comes
from our community he worked as
a network security analyst and

00:01:30.724-->00:01:35.429
forensic manager for Toyota
motor sales where he did pen
testing, designed security

00:01:35.429-->00:01:40.634
policies, did forensics for the
legal and HR departments, that
is until he got his big break in

00:01:40.634-->00:01:46.707
Hollywood in 2013 um as a
production intern initially and
then two years later he got his

00:01:46.707-->00:01:50.944
he scored his job with the Mr.
Robot team and I'm going to ask
him a little bit about how he

00:01:50.944-->00:01:55.482
got there um in addition to
writing scripts he oversees all
technical aspects of the show so

00:01:55.482-->00:02:00.020
that's not just about putting
the hacks together but he makes
sure that the a the hardware

00:02:00.020-->00:02:04.224
that's being used is correct
that the set directoration is
accurate and all of that as

00:02:04.224-->00:02:09.229
well. Uh Tor uh sorry Kor put
together a core team of uh
consultants security experts to

00:02:12.466-->00:02:18.472
assist him with that and that's
who we've got here um so let
I'll guess I'll start on the far

00:02:18.472-->00:02:23.176
right there and come forward to
me uh no I've got to switch
gears here so we've got at the

00:02:23.176-->00:02:28.648
far right there is Andre
McGregor uh he's director of
security for Tanium um managing

00:02:28.648-->00:02:34.721
their internal security but he's
a former FBI agent and so he
assists in uh all of the FBI

00:02:34.721-->00:02:41.561
forensic stuff uh on the show um
and unlike many feds he actually
has a computer engineering

00:02:41.561-->00:02:46.566
background and knows some of
this stuff so. Prior to joining
prior to joining the bureau he

00:02:48.969-->00:02:55.108
worked as an engineer at Goldman
Sachs and was IT director uh for
cardinal health advocates uh in

00:02:55.108-->00:02:59.446
his work with the bureau he
helped establish the first cyber
national security squad for

00:02:59.446-->00:03:03.683
FBI's New York field office and
led numerous large scale cyber
investigations involving

00:03:03.683-->00:03:09.322
everything from financial crime
to critical infrastructure
intrusions uh next do I need to

00:03:09.322-->00:03:14.327
intro- Jeff? [laugh] Jeff Moss
everyone! Everyone knows him um
Dark Tangent of course, founder

00:03:16.663-->00:03:22.469
and director of BlackHat more
importantly of Defcon which
began 1993 uh former Phreaker uh

00:03:22.469-->00:03:27.908
is now widely recognized
computer security expert who in
2009 was appointed to the

00:03:27.908-->00:03:31.912
homeland security advisory
council to provide advice and
recommendations to the secretary

00:03:31.912-->00:03:37.317
on matters related to homeland
security. And from 2011 to 2013
he served as iCann's chief

00:03:37.317-->00:03:42.322
security officer, you all know
Jeff. Uh next to Kor is uh Ryan
uh Um I just Kazanciyan did I

00:03:45.926-->00:03:50.630
get it right? Okay, uh chief
security architect for Tanium
and has thirteen years of

00:03:50.630-->00:03:55.669
experience in incident response
and forensics, pen testing, and
security architecture, prior to

00:03:55.669-->00:04:00.874
joining uh Taniam, is that
taniam or tamian? Tanium sorry.
Uh he was a technical director

00:04:00.874-->00:04:05.412
and lead investigator for uh
Mandiant where he worked with
dozens of fortune five hundred

00:04:05.412-->00:04:10.317
organi- organizations involved
in targeted attacks although I
assume that Ecore wasn't one of

00:04:10.317-->00:04:15.322
them um he also helped train FBI
agents. And finally you guys all
know C.J. this is Marc Rogers uh

00:04:18.792-->00:04:24.564
who all of you know as C.J. C.
Junky uh is an old school hacker
who heads information security

00:04:24.564-->00:04:30.737
at Cloudflare and is a long time
goon here at defcon uh Marc's uh
obviously well known for

00:04:30.737-->00:04:36.042
pioneering pioneering some hacks
in the 90s and last year he gave
that fantastic presentation on

00:04:36.042-->00:04:41.715
hacking a Tesla. So um I'm going
to start with some overview
questions uh primarily initially

00:04:41.715-->00:04:48.421
directed at Kor I want everyone
to jump in uh with any questions
that you feel are relevant to

00:04:48.421-->00:04:55.195
you but just to get us started
on sort of the overview I want a
uh Kor just give us an idea of

00:04:55.195-->00:05:01.568
how exactly this show came
together. >>Um really quickly
before I get into that >>Yeah

00:05:01.568-->00:05:08.041
>>Can you guys hear me now?
Alright really quickly before I
get into that I just wanna say

00:05:08.041-->00:05:11.912
that there are two members of
the consulting team who couldn't
be here with us today uh Michael

00:05:11.912-->00:05:17.184
Bazzell and James Plock, and
Michael if you're here put your
hand up because I think he's

00:05:17.184-->00:05:23.490
supposed to be here. If not.
Alright um inspiration for the
show, our creator and showrunner

00:05:23.490-->00:05:28.495
Sam Esmail uh he is Egyptian and
he has relatives who are living
in Egypt who had to who

00:05:32.532-->00:05:39.272
experienced the Arabs reign and
just dealing with that and
knowing how a younger generation

00:05:39.272-->00:05:44.945
was able to use technology in a
way to thwart internet
censorship and get the access

00:05:44.945-->00:05:50.116
that they needed using
technology or social media was a
huge inspiration for Mr. Robot.

00:05:50.116-->00:05:55.121
That coupled with the fact that
uh Sam and I believe many people
in this room share a this

00:05:57.857-->00:06:04.397
disdain for how Hollywood has
portrayed technology and hacking
in film and television up to

00:06:04.397-->00:06:09.970
this point and upon my first
meeting with him that's like the
first thing that we bonded over

00:06:09.970-->00:06:14.741
was how much we hated that and
how we would cringe every time
we'd see a show about hacking or

00:06:14.741-->00:06:19.746
a movie about hacking [applause]
so. We wanted to do it right and
we thought that doing it in a

00:06:24.484-->00:06:31.191
realistic way would be dramatic
and would be enticing and
compelling and that really

00:06:31.191-->00:06:35.695
empowered me to just and I had
gotten into a lot of fights and
altercations since that moment

00:06:35.695-->00:06:41.801
and I still continue to do so um
even with these guys uh but it's
all in the name of making it

00:06:41.801-->00:06:46.206
authentic and making it
realistic and hopefully we're
doing a good job of that and

00:06:46.206-->00:06:50.877
will continue to do a good job
of that um so those are the two
main inspirations for the show.

00:06:50.877-->00:06:57.250
>>So how did Sam get the
characterization of Elliot
Alderson so spot on? Because

00:06:57.250-->00:07:00.854
that's it's not just the hacks
that Hollywood gets wrong it
gets wrong the hackers and the

00:07:00.854-->00:07:07.027
and the culture and the
community. >>So Sa- Sam dabbled
a bit in hacking as a teenager

00:07:07.027-->00:07:12.565
but by no means does he refer to
himself as a as a hacker these
days but it's interesting,

00:07:12.565-->00:07:17.570
having been exposed to both
worlds um writing and just the
tech community and the hacking

00:07:20.573-->00:07:25.578
community I see that just the
isolation the stressed the
anxiety, the social awkwardness,

00:07:28.248-->00:07:32.986
uh the amount of time spent
alone in front of a computer,
problem solving, how frustrated

00:07:32.986-->00:07:37.324
I used to get when I tried to
code, and I'd try to solve
problems and I couldn't figure

00:07:37.324-->00:07:42.829
it out is very similar to the
stresses that I experience
breaking story or or trying to

00:07:42.829-->00:07:48.234
nail a scene or or writing one
of these scripts. So I think
just the comparison between a

00:07:48.234-->00:07:53.239
hacker and a writer from a
anxiety perspective is very very
similar um and the the drug

00:07:56.176-->00:08:01.448
usage, the, the social
awkwardness all all of this I I
think Sam just infused his

00:08:01.448-->00:08:07.053
experience as a writer and put
it into this hacker character
and it works because of those

00:08:07.053-->00:08:11.324
worlds are very similar and I've
been able to make those
connections of how similar those

00:08:11.324-->00:08:15.895
worlds are and of course you're
using different parts of your
brain um but still I think a lot

00:08:15.895-->00:08:21.701
of that isolation and loneliness
is uh is rampant in both worlds
so I think that's why it works

00:08:21.701-->00:08:25.405
and I think that's why so many
people in this community can
relate to Elliot because it's

00:08:25.405-->00:08:30.043
it's hard dealing with people I
mean I think that's one of the
great things about Defcon you

00:08:30.043-->00:08:35.048
know you guys all get together
and actually you know connect
with each other in real life so

00:08:37.083-->00:08:41.588
>>But he also gets I mean the
other hackers that we see in the
shows are sort of like let's say

00:08:41.588-->00:08:46.626
Black Hat let's just call it out
um where they're all powerful
and they're um they're not human

00:08:46.626-->00:08:52.665
essentially um and Elliott is
very human and vulnerable and uh
basically psychologically messed

00:08:52.665-->00:08:58.872
up and a lot of things mentally
unstable um and those elements
all exist in this community we

00:08:58.872-->00:09:02.842
have you know suicides in the
community and a lot of stuff
like that, and he gets that. And

00:09:02.842-->00:09:08.148
that was unusual I thought like
so. >>And again I think that
it's it's prevalent even in the

00:09:08.148-->00:09:13.286
writing community as well. It's
a It's another similarity that
just it it it's the engine that

00:09:13.286-->00:09:18.591
makes the show work and I think
the character vulnerability and
him dealing with his demons in

00:09:18.591-->00:09:24.964
that way is what draws you to
him and makes him relatable.
He's not a superhero he's uh

00:09:24.964-->00:09:30.770
he's terribly flawed but he has
good intentions and he wants to
change the world for the better

00:09:30.770-->00:09:37.577
even if by doing so he ends up
destroying the world um it's
just it's compelling that way.

00:09:37.577-->00:09:40.980
>>Yeah you can face them and I
think that's the problem is when
you turn to me and they can't

00:09:40.980-->00:09:46.386
hear you. Um I wanted to ask
about uh sort of um forming this
group of consultants because the

00:09:46.386-->00:09:52.725
first season um the first show,
the pilot, Sam had done uh
without you. >>Without me yep.

00:09:52.725-->00:09:57.864
>>Um and then after the first,
the pilot, after it got picked
up uh you came on board um but

00:09:57.864-->00:10:01.634
you only had one consultant at
that time for the first year,
correct? >>Yeah it was me and

00:10:01.634-->00:10:06.639
Michael Bazzell working on that
first season uh and uh it the
the role didn't really exist, I

00:10:08.708-->00:10:13.713
kind of just fell into it I was
working for Sam I was in the
room I was pitching ideas and he

00:10:13.713-->00:10:18.084
knew that I had a cyber security
background so he knew that I
could help in that way so I

00:10:18.084-->00:10:24.958
remember looking at the original
bible for season one and the
evil corp hack that he had

00:10:24.958-->00:10:31.865
planned out was very fantastical
and kind of crazy and I I said
well if we want to ground this

00:10:31.865-->00:10:36.603
in reality this is how I would
do it and this is where you know
your data, your data targets

00:10:36.603-->00:10:40.573
would be, and these would be the
different methods of taking them
down and from that we kind of

00:10:40.573-->00:10:47.514
explored the you know attacking
the offsite take back ups and uh
a a redundant data center in

00:10:47.514-->00:10:53.086
China for you know disaster
recovery or redundancy um so
just we kind of formed the

00:10:53.086-->00:10:58.758
network infrastructure for evil
corp early on and that kind of
dictated our trajectory for the

00:10:58.758-->00:11:03.363
season one, the big hack of
season one. And it was me and
Michael Bazzell coming up with a

00:11:03.363-->00:11:07.800
lot of those ideas and
incorporating them into the show
and uh I was lucky enough to

00:11:07.800-->00:11:12.805
form the even bigger team um for
for season two which is which is
awesome. >>So uh why don't you

00:11:15.208-->00:11:20.213
walk us through uh uh I just
want to get to the hacking um
obviously um so a lot of the

00:11:22.916-->00:11:29.088
hackings appears to be grabbed
straight from the headlines uh
this is um you know straight

00:11:29.088-->00:11:32.091
from the headlines and also from
Blackhat and Defcon, let's just
sa- let's just admit you're

00:11:32.091-->00:11:38.765
cribbing from us right? >>I
totally am >>So the the prison
hack was a Defcon 2011 talk?

00:11:38.765-->00:11:43.803
>>Defcon 19 I believe uh Tiffany
Rad, Tieg Newman, Yep >>Tieg
Newman, Tiffany rad, yep >>There

00:11:43.803-->00:11:49.142
is a white paper and there's a
great demo I found on Youtube
that I studied and that was the

00:11:49.142-->00:11:54.314
inspiration for that last hack
in that show um so definitely
ripping you guys off one hundred

00:11:54.314-->00:11:59.485
percent [laughter] And now I've
got one of you guys on my team
which is great. >>Uh so you've

00:11:59.485-->00:12:04.724
had the ransom, no car hacking
yet though, ransomware, the IOT
hacking obviously uh latest

00:12:04.724-->00:12:09.362
episode we've got the hacking
android phones with the rogue
fem to sell um and also the

00:12:09.362-->00:12:13.733
affiliate link hack that Darlene
does to get free food um so
explain to us what is the

00:12:13.733-->00:12:18.805
process for coming up with the
hacks um do you have a hack idea
first and then it gets written

00:12:18.805-->00:12:22.075
into the plot, is the plot
written first and then you come
up with a hack that suits the

00:12:22.075-->00:12:27.080
plot and then how do you guys
work together? >>Um so the story
ideas come first and the story

00:12:29.782-->00:12:33.920
will always come first uh we
will always act in the best
interest of the story so I'm in

00:12:33.920-->00:12:39.392
the room every day with a group
of other very talented writers
pitching story ideas trying to

00:12:39.392-->00:12:45.765
nail down the structure and the
arcs for the season and in those
there are breaks in those

00:12:45.765-->00:12:49.769
discussions where Sam will say
alright here we need to have a
hack we don't know what it's

00:12:49.769-->00:12:54.574
going to be but Elliot's gonna
hack and he's gonna be at this
point in the story after we're

00:12:54.574-->00:13:00.380
done um so after that I'll reach
out to my team these guys and
we'll have a brainstorming

00:13:00.380-->00:13:05.351
session and I'll say we need to
work within the confines of this
story point and we need to get

00:13:05.351-->00:13:11.090
Elliot from point A to point B
and what is available to us? And
what's realistic, and what makes

00:13:11.090-->00:13:16.229
sense? Um and what's efficient,
what's smart? What would be cool
to see visually on screen? So

00:13:16.229-->00:13:20.099
it's weird that we kind of have
two different writer's rooms
working in tandem, I have we

00:13:20.099-->00:13:25.238
have the story writer's room and
then we have our technical
writer's room where we throw out

00:13:25.238-->00:13:30.043
ideas, argue with each other,
try and find the best option and
then once we finalize an idea

00:13:30.043-->00:13:34.714
together I bring it back to the
room and it gets incorporated
into the script and at that

00:13:34.714-->00:13:38.618
point it's like really short
general description, maybe a
couplet in one of the scripts

00:13:38.618-->00:13:44.257
that just describes the hack big
picture. Once we get to
production um that's where the

00:13:44.257-->00:13:49.262
nitty gritty detailed work
starts because we actually have
to pull off the hack so I need

00:13:49.262-->00:13:52.832
to work with the props
department to make sure the
hardware looks completely

00:13:52.832-->00:13:57.270
accurate and they've never heard
of a raspberry pi before so I
have to tell them exactly like

00:13:57.270-->00:14:02.141
here here's where you can buy
one, here's here's the model we
need um I have to work with set

00:14:02.141-->00:14:07.180
dressing to make sure that you
know we don't have a ridiculous
amount of you know cat5 cable

00:14:07.180-->00:14:12.485
all over the arcade when there
are only like five work stations
there, Um I have to work really

00:14:12.485-->00:14:19.025
closely with an animator and
these guys to nail exactly what
the screen content looks like so

00:14:19.025-->00:14:23.663
often times one of these guys
will do the hack for real and
will send me screenshots or

00:14:23.663-->00:14:29.035
video of it and then I have to
take it to a flash animator and
we build out an interactive

00:14:29.035-->00:14:35.608
animation based on what these
guys did and it's something that
we can put in front of Romy or

00:14:35.608-->00:14:38.911
Christian and they don't even
have to think about it they can
hit the wrong key strokes and

00:14:38.911-->00:14:42.815
the right characters will show
up on screen and the screen will
behave the right way we need it

00:14:42.815-->00:14:48.054
to and we shoot all of these
sequences practically um Sam
hates using green screen, I hate

00:14:48.054-->00:14:53.559
using green screen so we don't
burn it in after after the fact
and uh even that process like

00:14:53.559-->00:14:57.730
these guys will tell you how
many times I've called them up
at four in the morning saying we

00:14:57.730-->00:15:03.035
need to fix this and it needs to
be ready by 9am and then I have
to work with an animator and go

00:15:03.035-->00:15:07.840
through like fifteen, twenty
revisions to make sure that
there are no typos and make sure

00:15:07.840-->00:15:12.612
that everything's working
properly for him to rebuild this
terminal sequence or or or

00:15:12.612-->00:15:17.683
whatever screens we're seeing
and then I have to work with the
actors try and get it right and

00:15:17.683-->00:15:22.622
then I work with uh a completely
separate uh insert unit a small
splinter crew to shoot all of

00:15:22.622-->00:15:27.794
the closeups and the inserts
that we cut to in building out
these sequences so we're filming

00:15:27.794-->00:15:32.732
great shots of hands on a
keyboard and I have to make sure
that you know they're hitting

00:15:32.732-->00:15:36.803
alt tab when they need to toggle
windows at the right time like
little little things that you

00:15:36.803-->00:15:41.474
don't think about and that no
one in production and no one in
Hollywood really cares about but

00:15:41.474-->00:15:47.613
on this show it's a big deal to
us and want to nail those
details and luckily you guys are

00:15:47.613-->00:15:52.518
picking up on those details
which I'm really happy about >>I
want to say that I've worked

00:15:52.518-->00:15:58.691
some of the the largest breaches
in the in the US history and
working for Kor is worse than

00:15:58.691-->00:16:03.629
all of those [laughter] be
because at least when I would go
home from the FBI, I was at

00:16:05.631-->00:16:11.103
home, Kor would still call me at
three o'clock in the morning and
say I need an output I need I

00:16:11.103-->00:16:15.908
need you to take a video of a of
exactly what the output you know
Elliot would be doing and then

00:16:15.908-->00:16:19.879
send it to me in the next hour
because we're doing the
animation but what was cool is

00:16:19.879-->00:16:25.184
if you notice that there's some
Easter eggs that are are there
so you get to add that um when

00:16:25.184-->00:16:29.989
it doesn't work we have to work
through it for several hours or
change the hack I mean there's

00:16:29.989-->00:16:35.394
multiple times which we
unfortunately will not go
through all of them but we had a

00:16:35.394-->00:16:38.998
hack in place and it was in the
script and everyone everything
was ready to go and then all of

00:16:38.998-->00:16:44.237
a sudden it was uh I that's not
gonna work you know actually
when we tried to do the hack it

00:16:44.237-->00:16:47.907
did not work >>Can you, can you
elaborate on that, can you tell
us what the hack was and what

00:16:47.907-->00:16:52.912
didn't work? >>Ah no because we
may actually use it again but
[laughter] uh but but I'll

00:16:56.148-->00:17:00.820
allude to the fact that the
first episode was not the hack
that you saw was not the

00:17:00.820-->00:17:05.691
original hack >>Yeah he's
referring to the ransomware
attack on Bank of E in the first

00:17:05.691-->00:17:10.596
episode of season two. >>Can you
guys hear everyone? >>But but
even then you have to think

00:17:10.596-->00:17:15.201
>>Pick up the mics and hold them
in your hand yeah >>Ah but even
then it it it goes beyond just

00:17:15.201-->00:17:20.172
the hack specifically with that
particular episode it was the
set design and what we would

00:17:20.172-->00:17:25.244
need to be able to you know have
a bank and and the systems that
we would need and the type of

00:17:25.244-->00:17:28.948
personnel that would have access
to the systems that we would
want and how we would portray

00:17:28.948-->00:17:33.986
that on the show to make it
realistic for people to say yes
someone with that skill set or

00:17:33.986-->00:17:39.759
someone with that job role would
have access to that system and
if I plugged in a device or if I

00:17:39.759-->00:17:46.365
uh you know access uh you know a
specific system it could pivot
to the next system and then it'd

00:17:46.365-->00:17:50.436
have a cascading affect um
that's the level of detail that
we're going in because I know

00:17:50.436-->00:17:55.308
that you guys are looking at the
same thing and we don't want to
make CSI Cyber where green code

00:17:55.308-->00:18:00.246
is good and red code is malware
[applause] you guys all saw
that? yeah >>It's also really

00:18:05.051-->00:18:09.555
surprising how disproportionate
the amount of work goes into
some of these things. If you

00:18:09.555-->00:18:13.659
look at some of the if you even
look at some of the really
smallest things like the

00:18:13.659-->00:18:17.797
affiliate links hack is what
only a couple of seconds of
screen time >>Yeah it's just

00:18:17.797-->00:18:22.802
dialogue >>Yeah that was days of
discussion because the original
script the the hack that was

00:18:25.104-->00:18:30.676
laid out we hated it, we wanted
to shape it into something that
would really work and so it went

00:18:30.676-->00:18:36.115
round and round and we reshaped
it into something which
ultimately people are dissecting

00:18:36.115-->00:18:41.921
it and writing entire articles
on those few seconds that's when
we know we've got it right

00:18:41.921-->00:18:47.526
>>What was it originally? That
you rejected? >>We you can go
into it >>Are you guys familiar

00:18:47.526-->00:18:51.597
with what he's talking about?
The affiliate hack? Why don't
you describe it? >>So the the

00:18:51.597-->00:18:57.770
affiliate link hack was
basically, Dar- Darlene's
getting free food by using

00:18:57.770-->00:19:04.176
affiliate links that belong to
her boyfriend so that she gets
credited for whatever clicks

00:19:04.176-->00:19:10.750
that he should've been credited
for. The original hack involved
DNS cache poisoning and this

00:19:10.750-->00:19:17.723
massively elaborate just a um I
I looked at it and went that's
not realistic there's now way

00:19:17.723-->00:19:21.794
you would expend that level of
effort for something as simple
as that when there are so many

00:19:21.794-->00:19:26.332
other elegant and simple ways in
which you can do it. And we
bounced around the team and came

00:19:26.332-->00:19:31.303
up with multiple different
options and one we went with in
the end was actually we would

00:19:31.303-->00:19:36.308
target a specific piece of
infrastructure in Telco, the
Proxy APN and by compromising

00:19:38.411-->00:19:43.282
that anything that goes through
that APN gets rewritten into
whatever we want and the net

00:19:43.282-->00:19:48.387
result is a realistic hack that
could be pulled off in the real
world and could have real world

00:19:48.387-->00:19:53.259
implications and that's the kind
of hack that I want to put
myself behind. >>So this was a,

00:19:53.259-->00:19:57.129
this was a hack involving the
postmates website? >>This is the
postmates APN yeah >>Postmates

00:19:57.129-->00:20:02.101
dot com where anytime anyone
would order food um Darlene
would get a free ten dollar

00:20:02.101-->00:20:06.605
coupon for food, anytime anyone
would order food delivery she
would suddenly get uh a ten

00:20:06.605-->00:20:12.411
dollar coupon for fo- free food.
>>And something else that I
should just note, the script, if

00:20:12.411-->00:20:18.417
if we have an issue with the
hack, the script changes, I come
up, I I go to Sam or I go to the

00:20:18.417-->00:20:24.690
other writers and I say we need
to find another way around this
and it's it's interesting

00:20:24.690-->00:20:29.128
because I always I think the
most common argument that I had
in the room especially in season

00:20:29.128-->00:20:35.067
two was uh Sam would want you
know a big hack it's that's
intricate and complicated and

00:20:35.067-->00:20:40.039
it'll fill this page for you
know to to turn the scene to get
Elliot to this next point in the

00:20:40.039-->00:20:44.510
story and then when we talked
about it we'd be like alright
it's pretty simple and it's

00:20:44.510-->00:20:48.481
actually smarter and more
efficient if we have him do
this, but it's not as sexy as on

00:20:48.481-->00:20:53.719
screen so if I throw that idea
out Sam's like well that sucks,
I don't want to do that that's

00:20:53.719-->00:21:00.025
not that's that's boring so we
have to strike that balance of
what is visually compelling,

00:21:00.025-->00:21:05.431
what will move the story forward
and still meet the expectations
of the tech crowd that's

00:21:05.431-->00:21:10.402
analyzing you know the
technology being used and the
motivations for the hack and and

00:21:10.402-->00:21:14.140
the tactics that are being used.
>>Yeah and for me it's it's
almost like being in a virtual

00:21:14.140-->00:21:18.277
penetration test where you know
if you've ever done pen testing
or red teaming work you always

00:21:18.277-->00:21:22.581
end up in this situation where
you're a couple days in and
nothing you've tried has worked

00:21:22.581-->00:21:25.918
and you're kind of stuck and you
have you know a set of things
you do have access to and a set

00:21:25.918-->00:21:30.422
of goals and you've gotta figure
out how to cross that chasm and
get from point A to B and a lot

00:21:30.422-->00:21:34.360
of times the story is exactly
that you know Kor will come to
us and say so here's the

00:21:34.360-->00:21:39.298
context, here's what needs to
come out of it and um it's
awesome that if that requires

00:21:39.298-->00:21:44.470
adjustment in dialogue or tweaks
for the scene to make it real
they're totally willing to do

00:21:44.470-->00:21:48.407
that. The second part of it
that's fun is you know my
initial reaction to a lot of

00:21:48.407-->00:21:54.146
these that I worked uh with Kor
on was wow how are we going to
make this technically accurate?

00:21:54.146-->00:21:57.950
And it's that same sort of
conundrum and so you you sit and
brainstorm the way you do when

00:21:57.950-->00:22:02.321
you're actually in in a real
word pen test and you're like
well if I did this and then this

00:22:02.321-->00:22:06.859
and then this that actually
could kind of get the characters
there. And then it's all about

00:22:06.859-->00:22:11.263
let's do it on screen, let's try
to use some re- real tools,
let's use Kali, Linux, let's

00:22:11.263-->00:22:15.467
simulate as much of it as
possible and then streamline it
down to what can maybe fit in

00:22:15.467-->00:22:19.004
couple seconds of screen time
here or there >>I want to come
back to the Oh do you wanna?

00:22:19.004-->00:22:23.175
>>Oh I was just going to say
what is on the other side of
that what's very hard is if in

00:22:23.175-->00:22:27.880
if you haven't caught up you're
gonna you know that the FBI is
about to be hacked, having to

00:22:27.880-->00:22:33.185
walk through the technical
accuracy of hacking the FBI
without disclosing any secrets,

00:22:33.185-->00:22:38.257
and and having national security
>>I was going to get to that yes
>>implications and being able to

00:22:38.257-->00:22:42.861
do it in such a way where yo'ure
able to gain access to the
information that will obviously

00:22:42.861-->00:22:48.467
advance uh fsociety but not
reveal anything that I don't
want anyone in this room to be

00:22:48.467-->00:22:53.105
able to also uh leverage so
>>The recipe to hack the FBI
>>Yeah we must have had, I don't

00:22:53.105-->00:22:57.977
know how many hours we've
discussed the FBI infrastructure
and how to hack the FBI >>Yes

00:22:57.977-->00:23:02.948
>>But if a lot of a lot work
went into it >>I know so much
about hacking the FBI now

00:23:02.948-->00:23:09.321
[laughter] >>And the FBI knows
that you know that >>Hey I I
wanted to I wanted to come back

00:23:09.321-->00:23:13.826
to the hacking but I wanted to
jump to Opsec for a second here
uh Jeff wrote a great article

00:23:13.826-->00:23:20.666
for Playboy in which he uh you
pointed out some of the the
Opsec issues with the hacking

00:23:20.666-->00:23:25.604
group um the mobile phones and
all that yeah >>So it's tough
because I love the show, and so

00:23:25.604-->00:23:29.074
I don't want to be that guy on
the side of the road pick you
know picking off of oh well they

00:23:29.074-->00:23:34.580
forgot a comma oh and they
didn't yeah well but you tell a
story about how Sam sits there

00:23:34.580-->00:23:38.117
and like at the moment something
somebody online says something
negative about the show it's

00:23:38.117-->00:23:43.722
like Sam calls you is like did
we get that right? Um 'because
he's so obsessed and so it's

00:23:43.722-->00:23:49.295
tough because I want to provide
criticism but I uh and insight
but I don't obviously wanna tell

00:23:49.295-->00:23:55.668
you your job and so that's why
my last article I was talking
about surveillance um operations

00:23:55.668-->00:24:00.739
and I I was trying to guess well
is she being followed are you
trying to show that Darlene is

00:24:00.739-->00:24:05.477
um freaking out, is she seeing
ghosts you know where there
aren't any, so I just had to

00:24:05.477-->00:24:09.682
assume no she's probably really
being followed because there's
some dark army action going on,

00:24:09.682-->00:24:13.152
there's some FBI action, so
let's just pretend she's being
followed, what did she just do

00:24:13.152-->00:24:16.755
wrong? And what did the
followers do wrong? Like you
would never reveal yourself as a

00:24:16.755-->00:24:21.493
follower unless you were trying
to send a message to the person
you were following and you'd

00:24:21.493-->00:24:25.831
only do that if you want them to
change a behavior or spook them
and then see what their reaction

00:24:25.831-->00:24:29.301
is, see how they behave like you
reveal that they're being, that
you're following them and you

00:24:29.301-->00:24:33.706
see, can you force an error and
then what does that error reveal
right? You see this in TV all of

00:24:33.706-->00:24:38.544
the time um and so I've been
having a lot of fun with it
because I'm tying it back to

00:24:38.544-->00:24:42.881
other books I'm trying to think
of other movies so I'm trying to
you know broad broader picture

00:24:42.881-->00:24:47.753
but so far you've been getting
almost everything right which is
pretty cool um surveillance is

00:24:47.753-->00:24:52.391
really really hard to do and at
some point you know you're gonna
have to start criticising by

00:24:52.391-->00:24:56.929
saying well how do these people
who have never done this before
professionally, they don't have

00:24:56.929-->00:25:00.666
professional training, you don't
learn how to do like tag team
surveillance, counter

00:25:00.666-->00:25:05.170
surveillance unless you actually
do it so at some point I'm
waiting for them to put on VR

00:25:05.170-->00:25:09.074
goggles and say no wait I'm
practicing my counter
surveillance runs and so we're

00:25:09.074-->00:25:15.147
just assuming that they have all
the skill and all this knowledge
um and so at some point I'm

00:25:15.147-->00:25:20.052
waiting for the backstory of
like how do they learn all of
this stuff >>If we ever do that

00:25:20.052-->00:25:25.591
or if we ever drop a cat5 cable
out of an airplane [laughter]
into a car underneath it, I want

00:25:25.591-->00:25:30.596
you to all kill me. >>Um there
is something else that I do want
to touch on what Equin what Ryan

00:25:33.866-->00:25:38.537
was was saying about using real
tools >>Yes I >>can I bring this
up, can I talk about this? >>Uh

00:25:38.537-->00:25:41.573
Let me just let me just let's
just introdu- introduce this for
a second here because one of the

00:25:41.573-->00:25:46.745
things that uh we've seen we've
all seen in Mr. Robot is that
they're actually using the too-

00:25:46.745-->00:25:51.984
tools, we've seen uh Dave
Kennedy set tool, um and
everything else, and Kor is very

00:25:51.984-->00:25:56.522
adamant about making sure not
just that the hacks are correct
but that the tools are correct

00:25:56.522-->00:26:01.860
but he gets a lot of grief for
it so why don't you talk about
it >>So it is an ongoing

00:26:01.860-->00:26:06.865
struggle between me and uh the
legal department at NBC
Universal um in an effort to

00:26:09.802-->00:26:15.607
clear real tools on a hacking
show and especially using the
tools in a way where maybe

00:26:15.607-->00:26:20.179
they're they're helping a hack
or they're associated with a
hack connected to a hack in some

00:26:20.179-->00:26:25.217
way or something there's some
negative connection and
unfortunately uh our roles are

00:26:25.217-->00:26:28.087
just that's the nature of the
best, we're pitted against each
other because they want to

00:26:28.087-->00:26:34.193
minimize legal risk and I want
to make the most authentic show
that I can so it's very

00:26:34.193-->00:26:40.699
difficult for me to convince our
clearance department to reach
out to companies and in and to

00:26:40.699-->00:26:46.004
ask permission to use the tool
um it's very very hard I've had
so many conversations, very

00:26:46.004-->00:26:51.577
contentious conversations around
that very topic so it is easier
and and actually we've taken

00:26:51.577-->00:26:55.047
risks and I've had Mark reach
out to to members of the
community, I've reached out to

00:26:55.047-->00:26:58.684
members of the community and
we've got some great feedback
and luckily these people were

00:26:58.684-->00:27:02.721
fans of the show so we were able
to incorporate those that you
now that software or that piece

00:27:02.721-->00:27:09.394
of hardware in the show but it's
much easier for me if you guys
come you guys reach out to me

00:27:09.394-->00:27:14.233
directly you guys reach out and
say hey I want to showcase my
tool or this piece of software

00:27:14.233-->00:27:18.437
in the show, I want to hear
about it and I know I've read
some articles recently about

00:27:18.437-->00:27:22.941
product placement and
integration and that's all
that's all bullshit like this

00:27:22.941-->00:27:29.281
show a a theme of this show is
cons- consumerism and consumer
culture and from day one Sam and

00:27:29.281-->00:27:33.752
I have even we've always talked
about wanting to use as many
brands as possible, wanting to

00:27:33.752-->00:27:39.791
showcase as many brands as
possible and just really explore
the world of of of evil corp and

00:27:39.791-->00:27:45.130
businesses and and how they
operate so it it helps us it
makes it helps us ground the

00:27:45.130-->00:27:49.735
show in reality if we can use
real software so if you guys
want if you guys want your tools

00:27:49.735-->00:27:54.173
showcased in the show, let me
know because it's much easier if
you express interest first

00:27:54.173-->00:27:59.811
instead of me having to convince
um a conglomerate to [laugh] to
reach out to you >>You actually

00:27:59.811-->00:28:05.317
you actually used a real company
uh with a DDOS it was Prolexic
um in the first season >> Yep

00:28:05.317-->00:28:10.322
definitely. Um we use a lot of
we use a lot of real companies
in in the first season and it's

00:28:10.322-->00:28:15.327
just there are these there are
these instances where we do kind
of a knock off where it looks

00:28:15.327-->00:28:19.765
like a specific tool but we
can't make it look exactly like
it and I just kinda I just want

00:28:19.765-->00:28:24.770
to stay away from that I would
much rather use uh real tools
real solutions so >>Uh Marc you

00:28:26.772-->00:28:31.443
had said that uh when you're
doing the real simulations of
the hacks um and you're going

00:28:31.443-->00:28:37.783
through the steps um you talked
about actually consulting with
outside experts in some cases uh

00:28:37.783-->00:28:42.788
with different expertise uh to
figure out reactions, kinetic
reactions and things like that,

00:28:42.788-->00:28:47.359
you want to talk about that a
second? >>Yeah and it's not just
me I think everyone in the team

00:28:47.359-->00:28:51.063
has reached out and there are a
couple of could I go into detail
and uh uh on the thing with the

00:28:51.063-->00:28:57.603
>>No >>Can I go into details
about the thing at the place at
the time? >>So it the so the uh

00:28:57.603-->00:29:02.541
it uh the problem is that I
would love to talk about all of
this stuff but we can't because

00:29:05.844-->00:29:10.549
we don't want to give away
spoilers that will damage the
story or spoil any of the

00:29:10.549-->00:29:15.287
illusions coming up but let's
just say there are a number of
things that happen in different

00:29:15.287-->00:29:21.593
parts of the show and if we have
any doubts about the realism or
if we have any concerns about

00:29:21.593-->00:29:28.367
the physics involved or the
science behind it we will reach
out to experts professors in

00:29:28.367-->00:29:33.972
some cases and talk to them and
say look in this hypothetical
situation which I can't tell you

00:29:33.972-->00:29:40.245
about and I can't tell you why,
would this work? Is this
realistic? How would you expect

00:29:40.245-->00:29:44.916
this to happen, is there any
advice you can give us about
what to expect? And we take that

00:29:44.916-->00:29:51.757
onboard and we use that to shape
what we do and ultimately the
the production team uses that to

00:29:51.757-->00:29:55.894
shape everything that goes on
from that point. >>And we we do
that with everything by the way.

00:29:55.894-->00:30:00.699
It's not just from an IT
perspective or a a scientific
perspective, even from an

00:30:00.699-->00:30:05.704
economics perspective or a
psychology perspective we seek
out experts in those fields to

00:30:08.106-->00:30:14.112
make sure that we are nailing
the accuracy of what would a
post 59 world look like uh what

00:30:14.112-->00:30:19.284
would Elliot how would Elliot
react to certain situations
having you know dealing with

00:30:19.284-->00:30:23.789
these delusions and and these
inner demons so it's it's
something that we we we always

00:30:23.789-->00:30:28.226
want to reach out to experts in
those fields. >>So what are your
favorite hacks so far in the

00:30:28.226-->00:30:33.398
show? Each of you? It doesn't
have to be one that you've
worked on or it could be or? Or

00:30:33.398-->00:30:37.235
Jeff, do you have a favorite
that you've seen? >>Well the one
that kind of hooked me finally I

00:30:37.235-->00:30:43.408
was all in on the show was when
I started seeing hacks fail,
because normally the hack always

00:30:43.408-->00:30:47.679
works and just at the right time
and I think it was towards the
end of season one when they're

00:30:47.679-->00:30:51.750
dropping USB keys and the keys
didn't work and then the the
fire I mean the police

00:30:51.750-->00:30:56.021
department anti virus or
something caught something and
all of that stuff made me think

00:30:56.021-->00:30:59.825
okay great you know now are they
going to problem solve? How are
they gonna get around that? And

00:30:59.825-->00:31:05.063
I th- the failure of the hack
was actually more uh impressive
to me than the success of the

00:31:05.063-->00:31:10.969
hack >>Uh the first thing that
hooked me was actually really
simple it was when Elliot's in

00:31:10.969-->00:31:15.574
season one guessing people's
passwords uh the fact that it
wasn't like in you know

00:31:15.574-->00:31:20.312
conventional TV depictions where
it's just guessing something
super obvious like password one

00:31:20.312-->00:31:25.817
it was combinations of patter-
password patterns that people
often use like uh last two

00:31:25.817-->00:31:29.755
digits of the year they're born
with a really common password
phrase and if you've ever done

00:31:29.755-->00:31:34.059
password cracking or looked at
the statistical analysis of most
common password patterns and

00:31:34.059-->00:31:39.965
dumps you see exactly that so
his whole mindset about figuring
out passwords for his different

00:31:39.965-->00:31:43.835
targets and and how
realistically that was portrayed
really made me realize like wow

00:31:43.835-->00:31:48.840
they're actually thinking about
this in a realistic manner. >>Uh
for me season two episode one

00:31:51.109-->00:31:54.980
where you had the booby trapped
computer that lit on that got
that lit on fire >>The thermite

00:31:54.980-->00:31:59.985
>>Uh I've been in so many
situations where I've watched my
peers uh not really do the the

00:32:02.687-->00:32:07.626
proper chain of custody and
evidence collection for an
instant response and you know it

00:32:07.626-->00:32:13.064
it's very accurate when you're
you know the local state police
department that are still trying

00:32:13.064-->00:32:17.369
to figure out how to deal with
computers and how to deal with
digital evidence and uh it was

00:32:17.369-->00:32:22.507
just very accurate and I I I
think that you'll see that as
the season grows that there's

00:32:22.507-->00:32:27.445
more of an FBI presence and and
how the FBI would deal with
instant response and the data

00:32:27.445-->00:32:31.750
breach but that was a pretty
cool hack >>This is always a
hard question for me because I'm

00:32:31.750-->00:32:36.421
really torn because you know I
love a lot of the hacks that we
did in season one and that we're

00:32:36.421-->00:32:42.427
doing in season two um but if I
had to choose one it would
probably be episode five uh when

00:32:42.427-->00:32:47.432
Mobley uses set to spoof uh a
text message to one of the
workers um to create a diversion

00:32:49.868-->00:32:55.240
I just >>This was in the data
center where they had to get
Elliot was trying to deposit the

00:32:55.240-->00:32:59.811
raspberry pi >>Correct, correct
>>Needed to get a worker and he
spoofs >>Actually my favorite

00:32:59.811-->00:33:04.316
might be the raspberry pi I take
it back >>I love it in that same
episode when they edit the

00:33:04.316-->00:33:09.754
Wikipedia to uh give Elliott's
cover identity some background
yeah and the amazing part of

00:33:09.754-->00:33:13.058
that is I'm seeing that scene
for the first time and I'm
thinking well that's not

00:33:13.058-->00:33:17.062
realistic because like if that's
a high profile person, his
wikipedia page isn't going to

00:33:17.062-->00:33:22.000
just be editable by everyone but
no then the dialogue in the show
like on scene letter sets

00:33:22.000-->00:33:26.805
credibility for him having spent
all those years building up
reputations that he could edit

00:33:26.805-->00:33:32.210
those wikipedia pages >>Yeah and
then I remember watching that
scene I was thinking Uh oh!

00:33:32.210-->00:33:37.215
Elliot didn't put on any gloves,
his fingerprints are all over
that raspberry pi. [laughter]

00:33:39.417-->00:33:44.422
>>Marc did you have a favorite?
>>I I have to say I I loved all
of them and for me the biggest

00:33:47.158-->00:33:51.663
thing was I watched the whole of
season one and I didn't throw
anything at the TV [laughter]

00:33:51.663-->00:33:57.802
>>You had said, you had said uh
when we talked that eh your goal
in going into season two is

00:33:57.802-->00:34:03.241
actually to make the hacks more
elaborate than season one um and
so and you were also concerned

00:34:03.241-->00:34:07.812
that hacking can become very
repetitive um because hackers
tend to when they find something

00:34:07.812-->00:34:12.784
successful they tend to repeat
it over and over and over again
so how are you going to I mean

00:34:12.784-->00:34:17.589
this show could go on for five
years like how are you going to
um get over that issue of re-

00:34:17.589-->00:34:23.028
repetition? >>I think the way
they're doing it is by widening
the team and bringing on new

00:34:23.028-->00:34:28.833
minds with new ideas and the it
it is tough because like in the
real world as a hacker you'll

00:34:28.833-->00:34:32.804
have certain things that you'll
do really well and you'll keep
using them because if they're

00:34:32.804-->00:34:38.710
successful why change them? But
that doesn't make for great TV
because you know okay so he's

00:34:38.710-->00:34:44.416
gonna throw the USB sticks down
again, yay! Um much better if we
can come up with some more

00:34:44.416-->00:34:49.321
interesting things and by
bringing in new characters and
by bringing in new experts it

00:34:49.321-->00:34:53.925
widens the palate. >>Yeah I've
been fortunate to work with a
lot of people in different

00:34:53.925-->00:34:58.596
disciplines in in Infosec and
one of the things that was fun
for me was in working in a few

00:34:58.596-->00:35:03.268
of the really elaborate ah hacks
that are to come after this
season was trying to draw in a

00:35:03.268-->00:35:08.506
few different disciplines that
haven't previously been shown uh
in the proceeding hacks and so

00:35:08.506-->00:35:12.043
you know you think about all the
different fields, reverse
engineering, application layer

00:35:12.043-->00:35:16.281
exploits, and you know we're
just starting to scratch the
surface of the types of hacks

00:35:16.281-->00:35:20.352
that you can see, the types of
devices that are targeted, the
techniques that people are using

00:35:20.352-->00:35:25.190
so yeah hacking can get
repetitive but I think there's
there's still just this whole

00:35:25.190-->00:35:29.794
world of different interesting
things we can show that are both
realistic to the situation and

00:35:29.794-->00:35:34.532
also for people who are pausing
the screen and tweeting
screenshots uh have some good

00:35:34.532-->00:35:38.136
stuff to dig into. >>Just wanna
let you know if you guys have
questions you can start lining

00:35:38.136-->00:35:43.308
up >>And just so you guys know
that's a prob that's like a
primary problem that we discuss

00:35:43.308-->00:35:49.080
internally, this group up here,
we're constantly talking about
these ideas about how what would

00:35:49.080-->00:35:53.385
be the most efficient hack to
use for this situation and then
someone will throw out an idea

00:35:53.385-->00:35:58.289
and I'll have to say no we did
that in episode three of season
one so we can't do that again we

00:35:58.289-->00:36:02.627
have to think of something else
that still makes sense so we
have to justify why we're not

00:36:02.627-->00:36:07.432
doing that again and why we're
doing this new tactic and why
that makes sense for this

00:36:07.432-->00:36:11.736
episode >>So what mistakes have
you made? Oh sorry go ahead Jeff
>>Just wanted to say if you do

00:36:11.736-->00:36:14.639
want to line up for questions
the microphone is just right
here in the middle >>What

00:36:14.639-->00:36:17.842
mistakes have you made? Because
Kor you know Jeff brought it up
that the uh the fact that you

00:36:17.842-->00:36:22.080
know Sam is basically and you
are on Reddit and Twitter you're
not watching the shows when they

00:36:22.080-->00:36:26.384
air but you're actually watching
reactions to the show and when
people do point out mistakes he

00:36:26.384-->00:36:32.624
makes sure that you know about
them, so yeah >>There were um in
season one there were some

00:36:32.624-->00:36:37.996
screens that had typos and there
were things that just slipped
through the cracks of just you

00:36:37.996-->00:36:43.334
know some point you could do a
screencapture on one of the PDFs
uh and you see it in episode

00:36:43.334-->00:36:47.705
four I think uh there was a lot
of just gibberish and that was
because the animator who was

00:36:47.705-->00:36:53.078
working on it just just ran he
didn't fall asleep but just kind
of ran the the text that I gave

00:36:53.078-->00:36:58.950
him through like this randomizer
and just just put that into it
because uh there was a clearance

00:36:58.950-->00:37:04.489
issue and I it just slipped
through so I fixed it for the
second time we saw it in episode

00:37:04.489-->00:37:09.494
six or seven I believe but then
I think on Elliot's drug report
in episode three marijuana is

00:37:11.596-->00:37:16.434
spelled incorrectly like things
like that. I got an email from
Sam saying why did this happen

00:37:16.434-->00:37:20.004
why are we do why are we making
stupid mistakes like this? >>you
also had a phone in airplane

00:37:20.004-->00:37:24.042
mode or something? >>We did have
a phone in airplane mode, we had
Gideon's phone in airplane mode

00:37:24.042-->00:37:29.047
so it's it's uh it's interesting
because now I know who we're
dealing with [laughter] and um

00:37:31.950-->00:37:36.955
we haven't had we haven't had
many instances of that in season
two because I'm kind of a nazi

00:37:39.290-->00:37:45.096
when it comes to these screens
and if there is a mistake or a
typo uh I work with post

00:37:45.096-->00:37:50.535
production to fix it before it
airs so hopefully this kind of
thing doesn't happen but again

00:37:50.535-->00:37:55.373
it's I'm sure something's gonna
slip through the cracks again
because we have people devoted

00:37:55.373-->00:38:01.713
to screenshotting this and then
posting it on social media um
and then making my job and my

00:38:01.713-->00:38:06.718
life much harder, thank you.
>>You have a question? Go ahead,
You >>Um Andre? >>Yes >>Okay uh

00:38:15.894-->00:38:20.899
I'm wondering um if you were
involved in season one uh you're
you worked at Goldman Sachs and

00:38:24.869-->00:38:29.874
given like the culture of the
show and the messages behind it
uh why and when you left Goldman

00:38:34.345-->00:38:39.350
Sachs and uh if that had any
like your bearings on like how
realistic it is to have someone

00:38:43.955-->00:38:49.727
on the inside in a bank, a big
bank? >>So So I didn't I didn't
work season one but it's

00:38:49.727-->00:38:54.732
interesting question because ah
Goldman Sachs is uh has a very
sharp culture is what I will say

00:38:57.168-->00:39:01.839
when it comes to technology and
when it comes to security and
being an engineer in that space

00:39:01.839-->00:39:08.079
in in the financial sector in
New York and then being an agent
investigating intrusions for the

00:39:08.079-->00:39:13.084
financial sector in New York
really had a lot of barriers for
sort of uh innovation and

00:39:15.553-->00:39:21.726
imagination that you might get
in Silicon Valley where I am now
and so I think you that that

00:39:21.726-->00:39:28.366
culture that you see in season
one is ve- and uh at ECorp is
almost identical to my

00:39:28.366-->00:39:32.637
experiences when I was at
Goldman Sachs when I had just
graduated college and I I could

00:39:32.637-->00:39:37.642
see that exact world today and
um you know I I I've seen it in
other in other situations but I

00:39:39.877-->00:39:45.583
think you're right, Goldman
Sachs is probably the the
sharpest of the ones that are

00:39:45.583-->00:39:51.789
there. >>You have another
question? Thank you >>How did
the decision come through in the

00:39:51.789-->00:39:56.861
writing group >>Can't hear you
>>How did the decision in the uh
writing group come to have

00:39:56.861-->00:40:02.533
Elliot break the fourth wall so
often and so frequently to turn
to face the audience, to us, and

00:40:02.533-->00:40:07.105
have that active dialogue, I
thought that was brilliant
>>Yeah, did everyone hear the

00:40:07.105-->00:40:12.010
question? >>So the question was
how did we come up with the idea
to have Elliot break the fourth

00:40:12.010-->00:40:17.015
wall and actually address us as
his friend um and I can't I I
can't I have to give all of the

00:40:19.317-->00:40:24.155
credit to Sam on that because he
wrote that into the pilot before
we ever formed a writer's room

00:40:24.155-->00:40:29.594
and if you read even the early
drafts of that pilot when it was
a feature it opened with Hello

00:40:29.594-->00:40:36.034
Friend and him speaking to us
and it's it's weird because it
it really draws you in and when

00:40:36.034-->00:40:41.739
I read it and when I saw the the
pilot it it really I I bought
into this connection that I had

00:40:41.739-->00:40:45.743
with this character who was
addressing me in this way that
you know I've never seen a show

00:40:45.743-->00:40:52.417
do it before in that way and
what he, in the way the ways in
which he's vulnerable with us,

00:40:52.417-->00:40:57.422
in the ways in which he blames
us for certain things, and now
he's upset with us, uh doesn't

00:40:59.424-->00:41:03.895
really trust us, I it's it's
fascinating and we talk about
that in the room and it's it's

00:41:03.895-->00:41:09.567
weird we treat viewer, we treat
friend as a character in the
room when we're breaking the

00:41:09.567-->00:41:13.604
story and when we're talking
about it and it's uh it's
something we really take in take

00:41:13.604-->00:41:20.244
into account with everything so
um I have to admit that's all
Sam. No it's true, I I haven't

00:41:20.244-->00:41:25.249
seen many movies or shows that
do that in that way >>Um hi I
think this is an incredibly

00:41:27.485-->00:41:32.623
ground breaking show, it's
amazing and I work in consumer
education >>Come a little closer

00:41:32.623-->00:41:37.328
to the mic >>Sorry I work in
consumer education so and I
understand the importance of how

00:41:37.328-->00:41:43.000
it is for us to see that this
hacking is right but what is
your team hoping for the normal

00:41:43.000-->00:41:47.705
person to get out of this show?
Are you trying to educate people
more on threats that are out

00:41:47.705-->00:41:52.710
there or is it just
entertainment? >>Well anyone
feel free to jump in when I go

00:41:54.812-->00:42:00.985
through this but uh [laughter]
uh we live in a uh age where we
are more and more dependent on

00:42:00.985-->00:42:05.823
our devices and our technology
and there are a lot of people
even in in the younger

00:42:05.823-->00:42:10.762
generation who know how to use
these apps who know how to use
their smartphones but they don't

00:42:10.762-->00:42:17.268
know the ways in which they're
vulnerable and if the show can
shine the light on that and make

00:42:17.268-->00:42:23.040
them think about like oh shit if
I leave my phone you know
unlocked this is how long it

00:42:23.040-->00:42:28.913
takes for someone to root it and
install a uh piece of malware. I
think that that's great if it if

00:42:28.913-->00:42:33.851
it increases that level of
paranoia and awareness I think
that's a very good thing. >>Yeah

00:42:33.851-->00:42:40.091
I think, for me, it's
unavoidable now to no matter
what walk of life you're from to

00:42:40.091-->00:42:44.562
stay isolated from the hacks
that make the news every week um
that's great from an awareness

00:42:44.562-->00:42:49.567
perspective but it also has a
numbing effect and what I love
is for that and for the show to

00:42:51.602-->00:42:55.840
really have consumers expect
more of the companies that are
building the software they use

00:42:55.840-->00:43:01.479
and depend upon that they trust
to keep their data private
because the reality is if

00:43:01.479-->00:43:05.483
they're not putting that
pressure, and organizations are
always going to take short cuts

00:43:05.483-->00:43:07.852
and we're going to keep dealing
with poorly des- developed
services, poorly designed

00:43:07.852-->00:43:12.857
software, corners cut, and uh we
all have seen the effects of
that so I love getting that

00:43:15.493-->00:43:19.797
awareness up I love getting
people thinking and caring and
changing their behaviors based

00:43:19.797-->00:43:25.002
on that >>you know what It it
it's just refreshing for my
mother to know what I've been

00:43:25.002-->00:43:31.109
working on for so many years in
life [laughter] and I I say it I
say it honestly because

00:43:31.109-->00:43:36.113
[applause] yeah we spend so many
years trying to educate the
public uh and it's not working

00:43:38.683-->00:43:43.955
right I mean finally I I opened
up CNN this morning and I
noticed that seven of the

00:43:43.955-->00:43:49.427
various um uh conversations and
presentations at Blackhat were
on the cover of CNN, I mean, two

00:43:49.427-->00:43:51.429
three years ago that was not the
case I mean we're getting to a
point where people are starting

00:43:51.429-->00:43:56.434
to understand technology and
we're getting to a point now
where you know hopefully we get

00:44:00.671-->00:44:05.676
the education in before people
have the personal pain that I
think we experience with hacks

00:44:05.676-->00:44:10.615
like Sony and hacks like uh what
we're seeing with the campaigns
and the iCloud photo hacks we

00:44:10.615-->00:44:15.386
we're we're waiting for that
that big cyber 911 moment which
hopefully never happens but I

00:44:15.386-->00:44:19.156
think we're all expecting it to
happen and if we can get to a
point where the public

00:44:19.156-->00:44:24.695
understands that password 123 is
not good in uh the the point
where uh we should you know have

00:44:24.695-->00:44:28.799
a little bit more understanding
of our security and we do it
through a show that that's fun

00:44:28.799-->00:44:35.640
uh you know that's a win on my
part >>For me I've been doing
defcon for eighteen years and

00:44:35.640-->00:44:41.846
for eighteen years I've watched
TV shows portraying my community
like a bunch of weirdos like a

00:44:41.846-->00:44:46.951
bunch of idiots who don't know
anything about computers, who
have portrayed hacks as these

00:44:46.951-->00:44:53.024
mystical things that happen when
you connect magical devices to
to cars and suddenly remote

00:44:53.024-->00:44:58.596
control them and I'm sick of it
I want to see real stuff on the
TV that doesn't make me rage and

00:44:58.596-->00:45:02.967
I want to see accurate
portrayals of people in my
community, people I can relate

00:45:02.967-->00:45:08.539
to and so being able to do this
and be part of this, to me it
was a gift. >>Well funny you

00:45:08.539-->00:45:12.276
mention that Marc because uh I
always remember the story, uh
you ever everybody seen DieHard

00:45:12.276-->00:45:17.782
4? Live Free or Die Hard where
the FBI cyber division is kind
of bogus? Well I always remember

00:45:17.782-->00:45:22.086
the the producer and director
came to the FBI headquarters and
wanted to see what cyber

00:45:22.086-->00:45:27.225
division was like and then as
they got a tour they were very
disappointed because it looks

00:45:27.225-->00:45:32.830
like a 1960s middle school and
you know as agents we would
watch the movie and we were like

00:45:32.830-->00:45:36.667
man I wish we had all this
technology [laughter] like so
>>It's like enemy of the state?

00:45:36.667-->00:45:43.274
>>Right? I I you wish you had
and so you know we show
something that that's you know

00:45:43.274-->00:45:48.846
fabulous on television like the
Bourne Identity type of movies
when in fact none of that exists

00:45:48.846-->00:45:53.017
and so now we have a show that
we're sort of able to slowly
work through the technical

00:45:53.017-->00:45:58.556
advances that we have today and
ideally like I say I said this
in in an interview I want every

00:45:58.556-->00:46:04.695
member of congress to have
watched Mr. Robot, to have said
oh wow this is possible because

00:46:04.695-->00:46:10.201
we need to have everyone that is
in the decision making ability
in in government to know that

00:46:10.201-->00:46:15.206
everything that we have is
vulnerable from a cybersecurity
perspective [applause] >>Okay so

00:46:22.847-->00:46:29.320
you'd mentioned uh you ha you
have to run things by NBC,
Universal's legal team uh, I

00:46:29.320-->00:46:35.026
just want to know how it went uh
when you decided it was okay for
Elliot to go pirate a movie with

00:46:35.026-->00:46:40.031
Utorrent and have all the scene
release groups tagged on it, can
you elaborate on that at all?

00:46:43.000-->00:46:48.005
>>There are a lot of fun easter
eggs that are hidden in this
show and that's one of them and

00:46:50.274-->00:46:55.279
luckily that wasn't a discussion
[laughter] so but now it will be
>>Now it will be >>Thank you for

00:46:59.216-->00:47:04.588
bringing attention to it
[laughter] >>You seriously, you
never cleared that? [laughter]

00:47:04.588-->00:47:10.294
>>I mean we cleared Utorrent I I
looked into some other tools and
I didn't actually uh you know

00:47:10.294-->00:47:16.000
Utorrent was the only the only
tool that cleared and I will
always go with a tool that

00:47:16.000-->00:47:21.005
clears as opposed to ripping off
another one or or rematching a
design so I can speak to that um

00:47:23.107-->00:47:28.179
for the the pirate groups I I
don't know what you're talking
about [laughter] >>I noticed on

00:47:28.179-->00:47:33.184
that screen too that Elliot is a
pretty bad leacher he like lets
up very he shares very little

00:47:38.756-->00:47:45.329
but he takes quite a lot
[laughter] >>Touche >>I don't
know where he got that tactic

00:47:45.329-->00:47:50.334
from either [laughter] just it's
weird >>So um I heard you say
that the screens are recredited

00:47:52.370-->00:47:56.640
with flash and that's kind of
interesting because most of them
are just text based screens and

00:47:56.640-->00:48:00.711
you could either just like for
example there's a Python script
in the last episode I watched,

00:48:00.711-->00:48:05.449
why don't you just write it in
Python um to create a mockup of
what it's doing or even rather

00:48:05.449-->00:48:12.256
than that just have a server
that is literally being you know
a a um your own test server that

00:48:12.256-->00:48:15.926
you're literally hacking um so
we're actually seeing what's
happening rather than doing it

00:48:15.926-->00:48:20.264
in flash, what's the idea behind
you using flash? >>So we've
explored a lot of these options

00:48:20.264-->00:48:25.603
and unfortunately since we're
the first I believe we're the
first show to even bring this

00:48:25.603-->00:48:30.608
much effort toward this ki- this
level of authenticity it's only
me on set, it's only me and uh a

00:48:32.877-->00:48:37.882
video animator, video engineer
so the way to utilize uh the
crew's time um you know the

00:48:40.217-->00:48:46.590
actor's time, the best way to do
it and the most time efficient
way of doing it at this point is

00:48:46.590-->00:48:52.296
creating a flash animation only
because we have medium shots and
wide shots where we have actors

00:48:52.296-->00:48:57.802
wal- sitting at the computer you
know sitting in front of a work
station and they need to walk

00:48:57.802-->00:49:03.374
through the animation and get
the right you know get through
the right detail on the screen

00:49:03.374-->00:49:08.379
and the added effort of actually
trying to teach them the correct
commands, and relying on that,

00:49:11.348-->00:49:16.287
or standing off to the side with
a wireless keyboard and running
it myself while they're kind of

00:49:16.287-->00:49:21.859
faking it, it's it doesn't make
as much sense as putting putting
them in front of an interactive

00:49:21.859-->00:49:26.063
animation where they can just
freely type and the right
content will show up on the

00:49:26.063-->00:49:31.902
screen and we can easily reset
it and go for take two
immediately after um my hope is

00:49:31.902-->00:49:36.907
in future seasons as I grow this
team that we can delve into that
more and show it show that in a

00:49:39.577-->00:49:45.282
more realistic light uh because
mainly because recreating these
things in flash there's so much

00:49:45.282-->00:49:50.287
room for error and typos and
just just weird behavior that I
spend so many hours uh with Adam

00:49:53.123-->00:49:56.961
Brustein our amazing animator uh
we go back and forth just just
really finessing these

00:49:56.961-->00:50:02.533
animations I would love to do it
for real but that takes you know
I have to convince uh our

00:50:02.533-->00:50:07.037
producers and I have to convince
the studio that it's it's worth
it's worth it to them to bring

00:50:07.037-->00:50:11.609
on a bigger team to to really
manage that because when you're
on set and the crew is like

00:50:11.609-->00:50:16.780
trying to make their day and
they're behind uh no one's
thinking about the tech, no one.

00:50:16.780-->00:50:22.386
The only person on set thinking
about the tech, is me. Uh which,
which sucks. >>So the the short

00:50:22.386-->00:50:28.926
answer is as a society we will
never get rid of flash
[laughter] it will survive the

00:50:28.926-->00:50:33.430
apocalypse like Twinkies and
cockroaches >>like cockroaches
>>flash will never go away >>The

00:50:33.430-->00:50:39.003
the other thing to think about
is in terms of the accuracy of
what you see on screen you

00:50:39.003-->00:50:44.275
couldn't do that with a Python
script because if you had a
script that just spewed out the

00:50:44.275-->00:50:48.946
things that are supposed to come
out on a hack, that's not really
the hack, that's a very

00:50:48.946-->00:50:52.816
artificial simulation of what's
supposed to come up. What
they're doing is they're

00:50:52.816-->00:50:57.821
creating an animation based on
the intelligence they get from
technical experts in in cases

00:51:00.024-->00:51:06.063
where I I've put stuff together,
we've done the hack, demod it,
filmed it, sent it to them,

00:51:06.063-->00:51:11.068
they've looked at that and then
they made their animation, so
that animation is an accurate

00:51:11.068-->00:51:16.073
recreation of the hack with the
right timings, the right output,
so it's really as accurate as

00:51:18.542-->00:51:24.648
you can get without doing it. I
would say their only two options
are, do it, or do what they're

00:51:24.648-->00:51:28.919
doing now, and what they're
doing now is pretty good
although it seems it's pretty

00:51:28.919-->00:51:34.058
effort heavy for Kor and the
others. I would love to see them
doing it for real, but the

00:51:34.058-->00:51:39.063
reality is, I've been hacking
for what twenty five twenty six
years of my life I'm probably

00:51:42.232-->00:51:47.237
way better than any actor and I
find it hard to do that, many of
the hacks that I've filmed, and

00:51:49.306-->00:51:54.244
made, and sent over, I had to do
four or five times to get it
right, to work out bugs, to do

00:51:54.244-->00:52:00.451
it, that's a hell of an effort
for a production crew to have to
take on. >>And even after the

00:52:00.451-->00:52:05.723
fact when I'm like after they
send me that material I'll go
back and forth with them because

00:52:05.723-->00:52:10.260
maybe we're working in a
different distro or maybe uh you
know we're in a different I

00:52:10.260-->00:52:14.999
don't I don't know I want to
nail what the prompt looks like
under these circumstances so

00:52:14.999-->00:52:20.037
I'll I'll ask these follow up
questions of you know if I'm if
my goal is to replace IP

00:52:20.037-->00:52:24.708
addresses with easter eggs or
you know host names stuff like
that so it's just constant

00:52:24.708-->00:52:30.014
dialogue I have with this team
about the the hacks that they're
creating and how how to

00:52:30.014-->00:52:35.019
successfully recreate them for
the show. >>Alright thank you
>>I have one ahem I have one

00:52:37.087-->00:52:43.027
question though for Kor I guess
the team and it's around the
timeline and so my last article

00:52:43.027-->00:52:48.298
at Playboy I noticed that you
had a character, they walked by
and they had a rest in peace you

00:52:48.298-->00:52:53.637
know american economy with the
the date um and so I'm trying to
figure out well how many months

00:52:53.637-->00:52:57.741
has it been since the hack, so
what version of the software
were we at, you know like what

00:52:57.741-->00:53:02.446
android versions are we using or
whatever so unless the show is
progressing at a current day

00:53:02.446-->00:53:07.017
rate you're gonna be in a
situation where you've got to
use like older and older distros

00:53:07.017-->00:53:12.456
to be time period accurate so
that is a whole nother level of
nightmare >>Fortunately the

00:53:12.456-->00:53:17.694
government will never be using
the most up to date anything so
[laughter] >>Hey, we the

00:53:17.694-->00:53:22.699
government is off XP, hey! No
more XP >>No but to, to Jeff's
point, uh the season two starts

00:53:25.235-->00:53:30.240
thirty days after the end of
season one, and the big evil
corp hack took place on 5/9 2015

00:53:33.377-->00:53:40.350
so of all of the piece of
software that I clear I need to
find the version that was out in

00:53:40.350-->00:53:46.657
May of 2015 which is which is
kind of tough uh and it's gonna
make our jobs harder and harder

00:53:46.657-->00:53:50.694
as each season progresses
because we're treating that
timeline in real time and we're

00:53:50.694-->00:53:56.800
just picking up where we leave
off each season so it's uh it's
going to get more difficult

00:53:56.800-->00:54:03.173
>>Next question >>Hi so I was
wondering about the season two
trailer or where that idea came

00:54:03.173-->00:54:08.912
from and whether or not that's
going to continue at all in the
future? >>So what he's referring

00:54:08.912-->00:54:13.917
to is um the phone number >>yeah
>>That was in the season two
trailer that led to led you

00:54:17.121-->00:54:21.825
somewhere which led you
somewhere else, which set you on
uh this whole this whole code

00:54:21.825-->00:54:26.830
breaking uh, this code breaking
game, and we have hidden a lot
of that in season two, every

00:54:30.400-->00:54:35.239
single episode of season two,
there are elements of uh code
breaking and anyone that's

00:54:35.239-->00:54:40.811
familiar with the Defcon badge
contest will get a huge kick out
of just dealing with what we've

00:54:40.811-->00:54:45.716
hidden in season two, so my
answer to you is yes, that will
continue, I ca- I don't want to

00:54:45.716-->00:54:50.187
give you too much information on
where to find those little hints
and where where they are but I

00:54:50.187-->00:54:56.126
know just based on monitoring uh
the Reddit uh the subreddit and
Twitter that not all of them

00:54:56.126-->00:55:01.765
have been found and more are
coming >>Could you actually give
a little intro to how that idea

00:55:01.765-->00:55:07.604
came to make that arc happen?
>>I wanted to do this in season
one and I bugged Sam and I

00:55:07.604-->00:55:13.310
bugged uh people at the studio
uh just using real IP, it
started out for just, I wanted

00:55:13.310-->00:55:17.714
to use real IP addresses and
real phone numbers, huge
argument, can't use real phone

00:55:17.714-->00:55:21.718
numbers, finally convinced them
to let me use real IP addresses,
they gave me a pattern of IP

00:55:21.718-->00:55:28.058
addresses for season two that
I'm using. And then once the
digital marketing team at USA

00:55:28.058-->00:55:34.164
caught on that our fans were
this into it and screenshotting
uh screenshotting every screen

00:55:34.164-->00:55:38.502
and I gave them examples of
people attempting to hit these
servers that we show in season

00:55:38.502-->00:55:44.508
one or complaining about you
know our fake IP addresses that
we used in season one uh so the

00:55:44.508-->00:55:49.179
digital digital marketing team I
think they kind of just between
seasons one and two were

00:55:49.179-->00:55:53.383
convinced that this was worth
their time and effort so now I'm
working very closely with them

00:55:53.383-->00:55:59.022
to build out this kind of
interaction and uh it's a goal
of mine in in season two if you

00:55:59.022-->00:56:04.061
see an IP address or you see a
URL it will it will lead
somewhere I can tell, I can tell

00:56:04.061-->00:56:08.298
you that much >>When I first
started working with Kor on the
first sequence that I I helped

00:56:08.298-->00:56:14.605
out with um I had done an on
screen mockup and then I did a
copy paste of the terminal text

00:56:14.605-->00:56:20.077
to make it easier for the
animators and I used uh because
it was all on VMs I was using

00:56:20.077-->00:56:24.948
RC1918 addresses so that my
simulation could at post talk to
each other but the situation

00:56:24.948-->00:56:30.387
required routable addresses so I
just in the copy paste like made
up an IP off the top of my head

00:56:30.387-->00:56:35.525
and stuck that in there I send
an email to Kor and then I was
like, I wonder who owns that IP

00:56:35.525-->00:56:40.530
block? So I go into who is on it
and it's DOD IP space [laughter]
so I emailed him immediately

00:56:43.267-->00:56:48.338
after and was like hey you guys
are probably going to change the
addresses but just in case um

00:56:48.338-->00:56:52.776
don't use that address because I
pulled it out of my ass but it
turns out I don't want someone

00:56:52.776-->00:56:58.482
seeing the show and then trying
to hit that address so >>Go
ahead >>With that with that

00:56:58.482-->00:57:03.287
being said the gentleman to my
left who made a comment about
CSI Cyber and the digital

00:57:03.287-->00:57:08.292
marketing so on Monday I'm going
to redirect CSI cyber dot com to
Mr. Robot because I control CSI

00:57:11.628-->00:57:17.734
cyber dot com and they took my
idea in 2008 and I'm pissed at
that, CBS and Paramount now are

00:57:17.734-->00:57:23.073
going to have to say tough shit
because I'm going to forward
that to push the show and when

00:57:23.073-->00:57:28.078
people go to CSI cyber dot com
it's going to Mr. Robot on
Monday, google it, check it out

00:57:33.050-->00:57:39.556
[applause] >>okay so you've
already, you've already touched
upon the dealing with the legal

00:57:39.556-->00:57:42.859
team a lot but I was just
wondering like what kind of
stuff have they rejected that

00:57:42.859-->00:57:46.296
you've wanted to do and like
what what the negotiation
process is kinda like?

00:57:48.565-->00:57:54.171
>>Unfortunately I can't go into
detail about what they rejected
without naming some of the the

00:57:54.171-->00:58:00.043
companies that were involved in
those talks but I know that it
starts off with me presenting my

00:58:00.043-->00:58:06.917
best case scenario, so here,
here's my top three choices of
tools to use for this specific

00:58:06.917-->00:58:12.356
hack and we're already working
to do that and sometimes if it
if something doesn't clear I'll

00:58:12.356-->00:58:16.026
go back to these guys and be
like hey you know what other
tools can we use that we can get

00:58:16.026-->00:58:21.031
away with and um so our
clearance coordinator will talk
to our legal department and

00:58:21.031-->00:58:26.303
they'll assess the risk and
figure out is it worth it to
approach this company or is it

00:58:26.303-->00:58:32.309
worth it to just kind of stay
away and you know do our own
thing with and make up a fake

00:58:32.309-->00:58:37.414
name or make up a fake design,
which is one hundred percent of
the time what they want me to do

00:58:37.414-->00:58:43.053
and so that's a huge point of
contention and I'll go back and
forth with our clearance

00:58:43.053-->00:58:46.289
department or our legal
department about that and I
understand it, I understand that

00:58:46.289-->00:58:53.096
that's their job and that's
that's that's great uh so it
speaks to you know it's hard for

00:58:53.096-->00:58:57.467
me to reach out and I did have
these talks with these guys and
I luckily Marc knows some of

00:58:57.467-->00:59:02.706
these guys so I I asked him I
remember asking him when we uh I
can't tell you what tool it is

00:59:02.706-->00:59:09.146
but there's a tool that shows up
in episode nine of this season
where I asked him I'm like are

00:59:09.146-->00:59:12.516
these guys fans of the show?
Like are the these guys are
hackers right? They're gonna

00:59:12.516-->00:59:17.087
they dig the show they won't be,
they'd be cool if we reached out
to them and asked them you know

00:59:17.087-->00:59:23.660
to get a to sign a clearance and
he was like yeah of course so
against you know what what the

00:59:23.660-->00:59:27.964
legal department wanted to do we
we we took that route and
luckily it made it into the

00:59:27.964-->00:59:33.470
show, I can't say what it is
yet, but it's it's great, it's
awesome, so it's um hopefully

00:59:33.470-->00:59:38.074
it's something that will get
easier and like I said before,
if you guys reach out to me it

00:59:38.074-->00:59:42.979
makes my job a lot easier and we
can see I think we could see a
lot more in the show if you guys

00:59:42.979-->00:59:47.984
just make first contact >>Hi
guys, big fan of the show,
thanks for making it happen. Um

00:59:52.055-->00:59:58.094
my question is I really like the
scene with the faraday cage in
and I'm wondering if you have

00:59:58.094-->01:00:03.467
any plans for other consumer
products or anything that helps
protect mobile privacy and

01:00:03.467-->01:00:07.604
security? >>Can you say the last
part of that question one more
time? >>Anything in the works to

01:00:07.604-->01:00:12.609
help protect mobile privacy and
security from other like uh
hardware or software? >>Yes?

01:00:18.315-->01:00:20.884
[laughter] >>I thought you were
going to talk about the faraday
cage that white rose was in

01:00:20.884-->01:00:26.022
>>It's one of those things that
if you go into it then we sort
of expose things, right? I mean

01:00:26.022-->01:00:30.327
it's not I I remember talking to
Kor about this because one of
the at one point we were in a

01:00:30.327-->01:00:35.532
conversation where he did say
well we already reused the we
used the faraday cage once we

01:00:35.532-->01:00:40.904
can't do it again so as we have
more ideas because I have a
couple in my head, I don't

01:00:40.904-->01:00:46.243
really want to tell you because
I want you to sort of see it in
season three >>Um as Kor already

01:00:46.243-->01:00:51.982
said there's stuff that's gonna
come up the thing that drives it
though is the story, we are kind

01:00:51.982-->01:00:57.754
of slaves to the story we're
trying to find technology that
fits into the story and the main

01:00:57.754-->01:01:02.626
thing I want to see with the
tech that I I put into it is if
you put the wrong tech in it can

01:01:02.626-->01:01:06.263
be really jarring you know,
you're watching this great
story, you're getting immersed

01:01:06.263-->01:01:10.233
into it, and then someone does
something fundamentally stupid
and you look at it and you're

01:01:10.233-->01:01:15.105
like uh and it's helping unravel
the story and it's really not
that interesting anymore so what

01:01:15.105-->01:01:21.444
we do has to fit in nicely any
opportunity for something to
come up we will will look at it

01:01:21.444-->01:01:26.249
and we'll try and use it because
we want it to be realistic and
at the same time we want to use

01:01:26.249-->01:01:30.921
it to send a message and the
best way to do that is to use
cool things >>Yeah and I think

01:01:30.921-->01:01:34.558
you're doing a great job I guess
it was kind of a leading
question because taking a

01:01:34.558-->01:01:40.030
repeated idea of a stand alone
faraday cage and making it more
mobile is what I'm holding in my

01:01:40.030-->01:01:46.403
hand right here so I want you
guys to use it, it's called
Silent Pocket >>Product

01:01:46.403-->01:01:51.408
placement [laughter] >>Good
shirt! >>Thank you! >>Uh how you
doin >>For those who can't see

01:01:57.047-->01:02:01.985
he's wearing an Evil Corp shirt
[applause] >>Uh yeah uh first of
all thank you for uh putting

01:02:07.624-->01:02:13.496
together a show about hackers
that doesn't suck >>Um should I
speak for everybody, that's

01:02:13.496-->01:02:19.803
about the best compliment you'll
get from us right? >>Though
Sneakers is a great movie so

01:02:19.803-->01:02:23.840
starting out fair >>Sneakers
kicked ass >>And WarGames
>>WarGames! >>WarGames was the

01:02:23.840-->01:02:29.179
same crew! >>But those but those
are movies not a TV show
>>That's true >>Um question

01:02:29.179-->01:02:34.784
about the easter eggs they're
starting to get more complicated
um what's the thought process of

01:02:34.784-->01:02:39.489
coming up with the easter eggs,
is it you guys? Because they're
sort of seem to be inspired by

01:02:39.489-->01:02:45.095
like Cicada, 3301 kinda puzzles
and shit so is that you guys or
is it like the media team or

01:02:45.095-->01:02:51.034
like >>So it's the media team
and myself uh working on it
primarily sometimes I'll check

01:02:51.034-->01:02:56.940
in with these guys about uh and
and just just ask for advice
about where it would lead um I

01:02:56.940-->01:03:01.678
know >>So you guys ship the
hoodie that we got for solving
the >>The the american giant

01:03:01.678-->01:03:06.750
hoodie? >>The fsociety hoodie
>>Yep >>That things is badass
>>That things awesome um it yeah

01:03:06.750-->01:03:10.787
it's I I don't want to say too
much about it because I don't
want to I don't want to ruin it

01:03:10.787-->01:03:16.292
and I don't want to spoil the
fun out there for everyone who's
involved in it but it is a back

01:03:16.292-->01:03:21.965
in addition to posting the show
and and you know getting through
these cuts and trying to trying

01:03:21.965-->01:03:26.736
to trying to finalize everything
I'm still working with the
digital marketing team nonstop

01:03:26.736-->01:03:33.643
on just the easter eggs alone
which is a huge uh which is a
taxing effort but it's um it's

01:03:33.643-->01:03:37.514
amazing how many people are into
it and I'm so glad and it's
really satisfying just the

01:03:37.514-->01:03:41.685
online response that we're
getting from it is it's awesome
it's more than I could have

01:03:41.685-->01:03:47.857
asked for which is great so I'm
really excited about it >>Sick,
thank you >>Thank you >>I I have

01:03:47.857-->01:03:52.629
a question you were talking a
lot about American viewers but
what what's your experience with

01:03:52.629-->01:03:57.634
international viewership? >>Um I
have a fe- from what I can
gather uh I know that it's not

01:04:01.237-->01:04:06.009
the show is not available
streaming all over like
completely internationally so

01:04:06.009-->01:04:11.648
people have to cut some corners
to to watch it depending on
where they live and last I

01:04:11.648-->01:04:16.653
checked we were the number one
pirated show within the past
month or so [applause] um which

01:04:21.658-->01:04:25.729
I'm fine with I know people at
the network probably hate me
saying this but I'm fine with

01:04:25.729-->01:04:30.734
that uh so and and and just the
social media response we've been
getting uh internationally from

01:04:32.836-->01:04:37.207
Latin America from Europe is
it's been phenomenal and it's
it's just it's just so it's

01:04:37.207-->01:04:42.979
really satisfying to see that
the show is striking a cord um
on a global scale like that it's

01:04:42.979-->01:04:47.984
phenomenal >>go ahead >>Salud!
So uh I had a really good
question but I kind of forgot

01:04:55.525-->01:05:02.298
what it was uh [laughter] I
guess uh >>you can step aside
and let the next person if you

01:05:02.298-->01:05:06.503
want to think about it >>I uh I
uh I apologize for asking this
one um but uh there's been a lot

01:05:06.503-->01:05:11.674
of speculation online about what
astsu is as a command and uh
>>What what can you say that

01:05:11.674-->01:05:16.379
again? >>astsu in the first
season at the beginning uses a
code called astsu kinda looks

01:05:16.379-->01:05:22.152
like Sudo or something like that
but uh um is it is it an
internal thing to Evil Corp?

01:05:22.152-->01:05:26.189
What's the what's the official
response on that? >>So the
official response, and I knew I

01:05:26.189-->01:05:30.293
was going to get this question
one day um [laughter] none of us
worked on the pilot, so the

01:05:30.293-->01:05:35.298
pilot had uh their own
consultant who uh I don't know
how present he was and and I

01:05:39.936-->01:05:44.808
don't know how what kind of
interaction he had with the
animator on on the pilot uh what

01:05:44.808-->01:05:51.414
what from what I have heard he
just left him with a stack of
code and left him to sift

01:05:51.414-->01:05:56.553
through it so you have an
animator who's never even worked
in a in a Linux distro before,

01:05:56.553-->01:06:00.356
staring at code and he doesn't
know what it means and he has to
figure out how to animate it and

01:06:00.356-->01:06:05.361
and recreate it for a pilot of a
TV show so astsu is probably
just a misstep it's just a and

01:06:10.400-->01:06:12.869
there are actually there are a
lot of there are a lot there's a
lot of things like that I could

01:06:12.869-->01:06:18.675
point out from the pilot that
that even I have issues with um
so luckily we were able to kind

01:06:18.675-->01:06:23.580
of remedy that once we got the
series pick up and I was working
on uh episodes two through ten

01:06:23.580-->01:06:29.185
to to make sure that that didn't
happen >>Cool, thank you >>thank
you >>I think one of the other

01:06:29.185-->01:06:34.123
things you have to remember is
these these kinds of shows
evolve they they're not static

01:06:34.123-->01:06:40.196
they and as they move on there
are additional dimensions that
get added, things get better

01:06:40.196-->01:06:46.970
processes change, so I mean you
can say reliably this show is
going to go from strength to

01:06:46.970-->01:06:50.740
strength >>That that sort of
raises the question, Kor you and
I had talked previously when I'd

01:06:50.740-->01:06:55.945
asked you like where, where do
you envision the show going, the
show's operating on many many

01:06:55.945-->01:07:00.550
layers and you've got the basic
plot of the hacking, you've got
Elliot's sort of mental

01:07:00.550-->01:07:04.354
deterioration and his old issues
with his father and things like
that, you've got the control

01:07:04.354-->01:07:07.590
issues and all of its
permutations of hacking and
things like that, now you've

01:07:07.590-->01:07:11.094
introduced this whole thing with
White Rose there are a lot of
sort of tangents coming and

01:07:11.094-->01:07:16.132
we've seen other stor- other
shows fail spectacularly when
they're trying to juggle too

01:07:16.132-->01:07:22.939
much, Lost for instance, uh how
are you guys insuring that you
guys don't get Lost essentially?

01:07:22.939-->01:07:29.112
>>Great question uh Sam and the
other writers, and I have a road
map for where we want this

01:07:29.112-->01:07:32.982
season to go uh unlike some of
the other shows that were
mentioned, I have a feeling they

01:07:32.982-->01:07:37.320
were writing themselves into a
corner because they didn't
really know what the end- what

01:07:37.320-->01:07:42.292
the end beat was. What the
conclusion of of the story was.
We know where we're headed and

01:07:42.292-->01:07:47.764
we have certain milestones that
we're trying to reach on the
way, so I don't feel like we're

01:07:47.764-->01:07:53.937
ever going to get into that
situation as long as we stay
true to organically, where our

01:07:53.937-->01:07:58.207
characters are emotionally and
where the journey would take
them, so as long as we're

01:07:58.207-->01:08:03.446
tracking Elliot and and the
other members of fsociety
emotionally and organically

01:08:03.446-->01:08:08.451
doing serving the story uh
justice I think that's I don't
think that's going to happen um

01:08:08.451-->01:08:12.355
and I know some people have had
some issues with the pacing of
season two and the first couple

01:08:12.355-->01:08:17.961
of episodes being a little slow
I've read a lot of reviews and
blogs about that and really all

01:08:17.961-->01:08:23.733
I can say is like we dropped a
huge bomb at the end of season
one uh we destroyed the economy,

01:08:23.733-->01:08:30.607
Elliot had the the realization
that you know uh he he has
delusions um and he's suffering

01:08:30.607-->01:08:37.447
uh from you know he's that he's
that he's basically insane and
he needs to re- he needs to re-

01:08:37.447-->01:08:43.653
he needs to work that out, he
needs to reconcile that, and I
think the him working out those

01:08:43.653-->01:08:48.658
issues and those inner demons
and connecting it metaphorically
to you know you know things that

01:08:50.994-->01:08:57.300
are are common to the tech crowd
whether they be infinite loops
of insanity or or kernel panics

01:08:57.300-->01:09:01.204
um I think that I think that's
organically where the story
needs to go and I still find it

01:09:01.204-->01:09:06.309
I think I think it's compelling
and intriguing so hang in there
that's all I'll say >>I'll sort

01:09:06.309-->01:09:11.781
of add that I I I think you'll
start to get a bit more
explanation as to the history of

01:09:11.781-->01:09:17.020
things as you go through you
know there was a lot of
illusions to certain things just

01:09:17.020-->01:09:21.257
happening, now let's try to
figure out and help you
understand why that happened and

01:09:21.257-->01:09:26.029
how the characters grew and you
know that that does take time
but I will tell you this without

01:09:26.029-->01:09:31.367
revealing any spoilers it gets
fantastic in a few episodes, and
then you'll get to the end,

01:09:31.367-->01:09:35.505
you're gonna be like wow! right,
it's there so just kind of like
make it through some of the

01:09:35.505-->01:09:39.075
character development and you're
just gonna you're gonna get to
that point and you're gonna say

01:09:39.075-->01:09:45.114
I did not know that. I can't
tell you which episode but it
it's coming soon >>Go ahead >>Uh

01:09:45.114-->01:09:49.752
thanks Jay my question, I love
the show, the raspberry pi gag
where Elliot got called out for

01:09:49.752-->01:09:53.923
holding one up like the timing
in that was like that's a
raspberry pi! that's a raspberry

01:09:53.923-->01:09:58.761
pi that was awesome, thank you.
Um my question is um with the
inclusion of the scene from

01:09:58.761-->01:10:02.732
Hackers, who was involved in
that conversation like it just
this panel shows that there's a

01:10:02.732-->01:10:07.837
lot of care and effort that goes
into making this not give
information about hacking, but

01:10:07.837-->01:10:13.009
that specific piece of of of
script just calls it out uh were
you part of that? Was there a

01:10:13.009-->01:10:17.113
discussion? I'm like if I have a
really calm question here, how'd
that go? >>I was a part of that

01:10:17.113-->01:10:22.118
and that was just our uh meta
moment of kind of poking fun at
ourselves basically and um even

01:10:25.621-->01:10:29.659
though it's ridiculous, I love
that movie, I grew up watching
that movie, I'm sure a lot of

01:10:29.659-->01:10:34.464
people in here are fans of that
film and um you know other
writers in the room are fans of

01:10:34.464-->01:10:40.269
it as well and it was a fun way
of kind of calling out that you
know some there's going to be a

01:10:40.269-->01:10:45.041
TV show that's going to fuck it
up you know and you know maybe
we we might be we might be that

01:10:45.041-->01:10:50.346
show, hopefully that, hopefully
we're not but at the time of
writing that script it was a it

01:10:50.346-->01:10:54.717
was a cool little joke that we
wanted to incorporate and I
think the community loved it and

01:10:54.717-->01:10:58.387
embraced it because I I have a
feeling that everyone in this
room has probably bashed hackers

01:10:58.387-->01:11:03.926
at one point or another and um
you know it was a it was a fun
scene. >> I for one would love

01:11:03.926-->01:11:08.931
to see fsociety on roller blades
[laughter] >>Thank you. >>That's
why I wear rollerblades um I uh

01:11:18.107-->01:11:22.245
so I love your show um had to
write it down [laughter]
>>Closer to the mic >>Sorry oh,

01:11:22.245-->01:11:27.683
I love your show and um uh and
thank you again for teaching our
parents uh what we do um so as a

01:11:27.683-->01:11:34.390
woman who codes um you mentioned
that there was a favorite hack
uh that that was failed um so I

01:11:34.390-->01:11:39.395
was just uh any thought to maybe
giving an unsuspecting female
[laugh] that uh the role that's

01:11:41.430-->01:11:46.435
kind of on the same, same level
as Elliot? >>Well I think uh
season two we made an effort to

01:11:50.339-->01:11:56.179
really flesh out the rest of our
cast and I know that season one
is more of uh Elliot's journey

01:11:56.179-->01:11:59.715
in figuring out what is
happening, season two is more
about dealing with the

01:11:59.715-->01:12:04.654
consequences and repercussions
of what happened and it gives us
an opportunity for them to deal

01:12:04.654-->01:12:10.059
with it and I think if uh you've
seen enough of season two at
this point to know that we're

01:12:10.059-->01:12:14.130
spending a lot more time with
our female hacker characters and
our femare- our female

01:12:14.130-->01:12:20.102
cybercrime character and it's
it's a hope of mine that you
know we continue to do that and

01:12:20.102-->01:12:25.842
you know just just keep watching
for season two it's it's
something that we are definitely

01:12:25.842-->01:12:31.347
uh moving forward so thank you
>>I I I will say this though um
it it I I look in the room and

01:12:31.347-->01:12:37.987
it's it's refreshing as well to
see the diversity because it's
not there at all the time in the

01:12:37.987-->01:12:43.459
C suite of the conversations
that we have about this and so
as the community is growing and

01:12:43.459-->01:12:48.431
learning to find people that
look like me or look like her
that are in the room it is just

01:12:48.431-->01:12:53.436
you know very awesome
[applause]. >>Kor, Kor we had
actually talked about this, the

01:12:55.905-->01:13:00.009
diversity on the show and how it
was very tin- intentional in
terms of >>It was intentional by

01:13:00.009-->01:13:05.581
it was by design, we wanted to
make sure we had badass female
hackers a part of fsociety we

01:13:05.581-->01:13:11.120
wanted to have an Iranian
hacker, we wanted Romero to be
you know the old school uh

01:13:11.120-->01:13:16.192
phreaker that joined the group
and and Mobley is of Indian
descent, so we're we're

01:13:16.192-->01:13:18.561
definitely it was definitely by
design and we definitely wa- our
hope is that it does inspire

01:13:18.561-->01:13:21.430
that kind of diversity that
Andre is talking about,
definitely. >>The thing is when

01:13:21.430-->01:13:23.432
you you look out at the Defcon
audience you realize that the
hacker community is that diverse

01:13:23.432-->01:13:26.502
which is why it's really great
to see a show that actually
represents what we look like.

01:13:26.502-->01:13:30.606
>>So we've got just five minutes
more, take a few more questions.
>>So I I always have a lot of

01:13:30.606-->01:13:35.611
empathy for the the thief the
perpetrator or the the victim
>>We can't hear you, talk close

01:13:42.585-->01:13:47.590
>>I always- I always have a lot
of empathy for the the victim
and the perpetrator but um have

01:13:58.834-->01:14:04.774
you ever thought about having a
back story for Philip Price? I
realize the target story is the

01:14:04.774-->01:14:09.779
99 percent but more important
question is have you thought
about the kid's workshops that

01:14:12.014-->01:14:17.019
we have here that uh only
through our children we will
conquer >>Actually, Marc and I

01:14:21.324-->01:14:26.595
were just talking about uh the
kid's workshops and uh I think
we're, a couple of us are

01:14:26.595-->01:14:32.702
probably going to do a talk at
one of those, uh either tomorrow
or you know tomorrow afternoon,

01:14:32.702-->01:14:37.707
to answer your your Philip Price
question, yes [laughter] we
thought about the backstory and

01:14:40.142-->01:14:45.047
uh if you keep watching you'll
you'll you'll get it you'll get
some more of that >>Go ahead,

01:14:45.047-->01:14:50.219
next question. >>I just wanted a
decent photo, no I'm just
kidding, um my question has to

01:14:50.219-->01:14:56.192
do with uh personal security so
obviously uh season one Elliot's
hacking social media sites,

01:14:56.192-->01:15:02.031
emails for you know his uh
coworkers or whatever um I
understand people with simple

01:15:02.031-->01:15:04.533
passwords aren't going to be
doing two fact drop
authentication or anything of

01:15:04.533-->01:15:09.004
that nature, however, most
servers, not most services,
there are services, uh Gmail,

01:15:09.004-->01:15:12.742
Facebook, if you log in from
another system, it's going to
send you an email that notifies

01:15:12.742-->01:15:17.413
you, granted if he has access to
those other emails it's null and
void but he'd have to be doing a

01:15:17.413-->01:15:21.984
lot at one point in time, he's
just one guy, was there ever
conversation about that uh in

01:15:21.984-->01:15:25.721
the tech world and if so what
was the reasoning behind not
including uh log in

01:15:25.721-->01:15:30.426
notifications? >>It's a question
of it's always a matter of time
and how much real estate we have

01:15:30.426-->01:15:36.432
on the page and how much time we
have in the cut to devote to a
hack and even the steps that we

01:15:36.432-->01:15:41.203
want to show we can't always
show them all, they always get
cut down in the editing process

01:15:41.203-->01:15:45.641
so it is a conversation we've
had and it's just us making the
decision of like what are the

01:15:45.641-->01:15:50.312
important beats we need to see
to to convey this story about
this hack and how he's

01:15:50.312-->01:15:57.219
compromising this account um but
to your point if I can get that
level of detail into the show,

01:15:57.219-->01:16:01.557
that's my goal, I think that's
all of our goals, to get as much
detail as possible into those

01:16:01.557-->01:16:06.562
into those sequences. >>Thank
you >>I, we have time for both
of these questions though, go

01:16:08.998-->01:16:14.370
ahead >>Um so first of all I am
a really big fan of the show, my
friends and I just love it um my

01:16:14.370-->01:16:17.907
question is so you mentioned
that like you get feedback from
Sam like when you get something

01:16:17.907-->01:16:22.077
wrong like there's a typo or or
somebody points out that like a
screen is wrong or a command

01:16:22.077-->01:16:27.483
doesn't work right um but have
you gotten any feedback about
sort of the show being used to

01:16:27.483-->01:16:32.755
teach? Um I had an opportunity
at my job to introduce some
colleagues of mine who are not

01:16:32.755-->01:16:37.793
part of this field to my field
which is forensics and I said if
you wanna know what hacking is,

01:16:37.793-->01:16:44.333
who hackers are, please go watch
this show, um so and I had
people nodding and and people

01:16:44.333-->01:16:47.069
come back to me, one or two come
back and said oh my god this I
watched this show and it's

01:16:47.069-->01:16:52.107
amazing and I'm frightened but
[laughter] so my question is
have you heard, have you heard

01:16:52.107-->01:16:57.179
about whether it's somebody in
the C Suite or a teacher, or you
know just a person saying I was

01:16:57.179-->01:17:01.050
inspired by your show, have you
gotten the feedback about this
show being used for good I

01:17:01.050-->01:17:06.889
guess? >>100% Um you have the
story about this? >>Yeah I mean
uh I I I was in meetings all

01:17:06.889-->01:17:12.561
week for work and I don't think
a single person be they uh you
know engineer, practitioner, or

01:17:12.561-->01:17:18.367
uh at the executive level hasn't
gotten that out of the show and
enjoys the increased awareness,

01:17:18.367-->01:17:21.837
enjoys the fact that they, it
caused them to think about an
attack technique or an attack

01:17:21.837-->01:17:27.877
factor that maybe wouldn't have
come first to mind otherwise so
um I definitely think that's one

01:17:27.877-->01:17:30.346
of the ways that it can be a
force for good and a force for
educating. >>And one of the best

01:17:30.346-->01:17:34.216
compliments I've ever received,
and I've received it on numerous
occasions is you know people

01:17:34.216-->01:17:38.387
will come to me and say I don't
usually watch television, like I
do I don't binge watch anything,

01:17:38.387-->01:17:44.260
I don't watch TV, but I watch
Mr. Robot because of th- the
hacks that you guys portray and

01:17:44.260-->01:17:49.265
how how scared it makes me about
my you know using my devices so
uh you know it's amazing >>so I

01:17:51.367-->01:17:56.805
I'll say you you actually have
the leader of the free world as
your fan [laughter] of Mr. Robo-

01:17:56.805-->01:18:02.511
it was actually very interesting
because I was on set and Sam was
super excited and he's like the

01:18:02.511-->01:18:09.251
president loves our show! And
he's like and like got contacted
by his personal aid and said

01:18:09.251-->01:18:13.322
actually I don't even know if I
should be saying it but I think
it's important because he said

01:18:13.322-->01:18:18.227
like I you know binge watched
the show and loved Mr. Robot and
wanted to see season two and

01:18:18.227-->01:18:23.132
it's like that is the levels
that we're getting right? I mean
that's exactly what we're

01:18:23.132-->01:18:28.337
looking for because then it's
just a trickle down right? I
mean if we can it there then

01:18:28.337-->01:18:31.941
we're getting others in
government and we're getting
others in the C Suite and and it

01:18:31.941-->01:18:36.712
that conversation that I'm I'm
hoping that we get right? >>And
my my hope is that's the reason

01:18:36.712-->01:18:42.318
he's interested in the show and
it's not because we impersonated
him in the first episode

01:18:42.318-->01:18:47.323
[laughter] of season two and he
just wants to see what's up and
what we're doing so definitely,

01:18:50.259-->01:18:54.396
I also don't know when he binged
watched season Mr Robot I don't
know where he has time, the

01:18:54.396-->01:18:59.401
president but >>Air Force one
>>Ah touche it's a plane
[laughter] >>Okay so my question

01:19:03.405-->01:19:08.410
is uh as far as getting this on
to a network channel, like
what's from from the network's

01:19:12.948-->01:19:19.655
perspective was it you know
here's a hacking show and some
they're saying something about

01:19:19.655-->01:19:24.493
maybe it's technically accurate
or was the technically accurate
part something that they

01:19:24.493-->01:19:28.464
actually cared about? >>The
technically accurate part was
something that Sam cared about,

01:19:28.464-->01:19:35.271
I'm not sure that the network
was that in invested in it at
that point, they just saw a

01:19:35.271-->01:19:41.410
great script, written by an
auteur filmmaker like Sam, and
they wanted to pursue that that

01:19:41.410-->01:19:46.582
project. I think once the pilot
came out and Sam was able to
deliver that level of

01:19:46.582-->01:19:51.854
authenticity it set the bar and
the expectation and you have
network executives reading you

01:19:51.854-->01:19:57.593
know these articles published by
tech journalists talking about
the technology on the show, so,

01:19:57.593-->01:20:01.797
I think it was something that
was always on Sam's radar that
he wanted to pull off and

01:20:01.797-->01:20:06.802
luckily when I met him we were
completely in line about that
and you know g- uh to his credit

01:20:09.271-->01:20:14.309
he just kind of empowered me and
let me fight fight with whoever
I had to fight with to get that

01:20:14.309-->01:20:19.014
level of detail into the show
and obviously the fact that I
was able to grow the team for

01:20:19.014-->01:20:24.353
season two speaks to the fact
that the network and the studio
are supportive of that effort,

01:20:24.353-->01:20:29.358
which is great. >>I think we're
out of time uh so just join me
in thanking the panelists,

01:20:33.729-->01:20:38.734
[applause] first of all for a
great show and their
participation today. [applause]
