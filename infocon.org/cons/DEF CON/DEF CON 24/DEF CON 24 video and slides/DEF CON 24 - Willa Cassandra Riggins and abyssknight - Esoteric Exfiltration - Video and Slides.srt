00:00:00.234-->00:00:04.204
>> So if you are in here it is
the Esoteric Exfiltration talk,
if you are looking for the other

00:00:04.204-->00:00:11.044
one it's probably in a different
room. So, uhm... this is me I'm
Willa Riggins. Uhm, I am a

00:00:11.044-->00:00:15.749
senior penetration tester from
Veracode, a member of the
FamiLAB hackerspace down in

00:00:15.749-->00:00:20.754
Orlando, uh... I'm the DC407
point of contact... I just, I do
a lot of things - OWASP and

00:00:23.023-->00:00:28.829
BSides. Uhm,but really if you
look at my twitter I just
retweet cats. [laughter] That's

00:00:28.829-->00:00:34.968
really all I do. So exfil101 -
how many of you are familiar
with exfiltration at all?

00:00:34.968-->00:00:39.973
Anybody in the room? Awesome! So
it's the know-it-all crowd. So,
for those who aren't in the know

00:00:42.142-->00:00:45.746
- data exfiltration is the
unauthorised transfer of
sensitive information from a

00:00:45.746-->00:00:50.684
target's network to a location
that the threat actor controls.
Now that's from a Trandmicro

00:00:50.684-->00:00:55.689
article. But, basically, that,
lie, "threat actor control" is
kind of our wishy-washy term

00:00:57.858-->00:01:03.630
here - uhm, what is that? It can
be their server, their social
media account, it could be their

00:01:03.630-->00:01:10.404
dropbox, could be anything,
right? So why do you care? Uhm,
data loss costs you money and

00:01:10.404-->00:01:17.144
your sanity. If anybody's ever
work incident response, it sucks
when you loose stuff. Uhm, if

00:01:17.144-->00:01:22.149
you've ever found creds on
Pastebin, that had your name in
it, that suscks! So anyway, back

00:01:25.686-->00:01:30.691
in 2012, Reddit Netsec - anyone
follow Netsec on Reddit? Yes! So
I did a survey back in 2012 and

00:01:34.928-->00:01:39.933
82% of the folks who replied
said "Hey, this stuff is
important." Uhm, you know, "It

00:01:41.935-->00:01:47.741
means a lot to us and our
networks and our money and our
companies". Uhm, so, let's talk

00:01:47.741-->00:01:52.579
a little bit about covert
channels and where to find them,
and this is kind of where the

00:01:52.579-->00:01:57.451
meat of the talk is going to be
cause I've done all the stuff,
I've done the research, I've

00:01:57.451-->00:02:02.923
gotten caught... Uhm and the
getting caught stuff is the most
exciting part because then you

00:02:02.923-->00:02:09.062
learn how not to do that. Uhm,
so, the first thing is mask your
traffic with normal usage

00:02:09.062-->00:02:14.835
patterns - so if you know a
company uses, you know, social
media or they're on webtraffic,

00:02:14.835-->00:02:19.806
or they're using protocols for
their everyday business like FTP
or like, uhm, you know, everyone

00:02:19.806-->00:02:24.811
uses HTTP or HTTPS. Uhm, some
folks have RDP open. Uhm, just
knowing that stuff is really

00:02:26.913-->00:02:30.917
important cause then you can
kind of build a model of "What
does a normal employees traffic

00:02:30.917-->00:02:36.857
look like, and how can I look
like that?" Uhm, hide data in
known safe payloads, so don't

00:02:36.857-->00:02:41.862
save. Uhm, status updates to
Facebook or Twitter, that kind
of stuff looks innocuous, right?

00:02:45.132-->00:02:49.403
You probably post five tweets
every minute, that's you know,
that's a lot of data - that's

00:02:49.403-->00:02:55.108
140 characters times five, uh,
not a huge amount of through put
there but it's still cool, like,

00:02:55.108-->00:03:00.047
you could do something with
that. Uhm, say with HTTP post,
how many ASP.net devs do we have

00:03:03.617-->00:03:07.487
in the room? [chatter]
[laughter] How many of you hate
the view state because it's 2Mb?

00:03:07.487-->00:03:13.093
Yea, that's 2Mb of data that you
can send out and, you know, no
one's going to notice it - it's

00:03:13.093-->00:03:18.865
just gone. Encoded base 64 it,
like viewstate, put it in a form
and just submit it to whatever

00:03:18.865-->00:03:25.505
web server. Uhm, that's a "meg",
you know, every single request
it's gone. Uhm, the other thing

00:03:25.505-->00:03:30.010
is stay quiet, you know, stay
within the normal payload size
like that 2Mb viewstate, don't

00:03:30.010-->00:03:37.017
try and upload 36gb to
twitter... Don't! [laughter]
I've... We've done this, uhm,

00:03:37.017-->00:03:41.455
it's not fun, don't try to do
that - you'll get rate limited,
people will be like "What the

00:03:41.455-->00:03:45.559
hell is this, like, why are
there all these tweets with
random data in it?" Uhm,

00:03:45.559-->00:03:51.498
Facebook will probably get
really angry if I did that Uhm,
it's important to realize that

00:03:51.498-->00:03:55.368
not only are you going to get
caught by other people seeing
that you're posting all this

00:03:55.368-->00:04:00.006
crap, but also it's going to
throw a flag on whatever egress
is there, so If there's a

00:04:00.006-->00:04:04.277
firewall or an out-firewall
they're gonna see a spike in
traffic and go "What is that?

00:04:04.277-->00:04:08.849
What device did that come from?"
And that's, that's one way
you're definitely gonna get

00:04:08.849-->00:04:15.288
caught, if you send 36GBs of
data over one channel from one
device all at the same time. So

00:04:15.288-->00:04:20.260
yea, definitely stay quiet and
set your payload sizes based on
what the channel is - so Twitter

00:04:20.260-->00:04:26.800
obviously is a 140 characters,
uhm, you're kinda limited there;
DNS is even smaller, DNS as an

00:04:26.800-->00:04:33.507
exfill method kinda sucks.
Facebook gives you a lot more
leeway but, uhm, you know,

00:04:33.507-->00:04:36.743
there's a lot of management
involved with that, but we'll
talk about that a little bit

00:04:36.743-->00:04:41.581
later. Encoding and encrypting
your data, so, depending on who
you're doing this for and why

00:04:41.581-->00:04:45.919
you're doing this, you might not
want people to know that you
stole that data, right? You

00:04:45.919-->00:04:49.723
don't want them to know, you
don't want them to Google and be
like "Why is my name in this

00:04:49.723-->00:04:54.795
weird twitter stream of binary
data? why is it in there?".
Cause they'll trace it back,

00:04:54.795-->00:04:58.665
figure it out, contact Twitter
which will take a long time,
they'll get back and they'll be

00:04:58.665-->00:05:02.135
like "Oh, it's this device
that's uploading all this crap
from your server" - you just

00:05:04.271-->00:05:07.807
want to make sure that people
can't find it. There's a really
cool tool called "Cloakify", by

00:05:07.807-->00:05:12.846
one of our other attendees who
might be here... Uhm, that
basically does DLP avoidance.

00:05:12.846-->00:05:18.251
That's a really cool thing that,
uhm, you can use that to kind of
transform the data before you

00:05:18.251-->00:05:24.758
send it out. So... So we talked
about transport, right? We
talked a little bit about why

00:05:24.758-->00:05:30.664
you do the things the way you do
them, but let's talk about
specific examples. So, on the

00:05:30.664-->00:05:35.402
transport layer, you know, you
have network protocols we can do
point-to-point stuff with HTTP;

00:05:35.402-->00:05:42.275
we can do Tellnet, Netcal, all
that stuff. Third-party drops
like Dropbox or putting it on

00:05:42.275-->00:05:48.281
Facebook or anything like that,
that's kind of taking the threat
actor control to a third party

00:05:48.281-->00:05:53.320
and then getting it relayed down
to another, you know, device.
So,those are cool cause, it's...

00:05:53.320-->00:05:56.990
it's kinda like a deaddrop. Then
going to the airwaves, which is
something that I really wanted

00:05:56.990-->00:06:01.361
to show off today, but I am a
terrible...like, I didn't
sacrifice enough things to the

00:06:01.361-->00:06:07.334
demo gods and my demo....
doesn't work, and then the
radios I brought, don't work,

00:06:07.334-->00:06:13.907
so... Uhm I will be having to
contact Sparkphone and figure
out what to do there... So,

00:06:13.907-->00:06:18.912
network protocols, the obvious
stuff, HTTP, SSH, NetCat - I
mean, if you can get out with

00:06:21.181-->00:06:25.118
that stuff by all means use it,
like, that's the easiest low
hanging fruit. You're gonna get

00:06:25.118-->00:06:28.989
out, that's fine, and by the
time anyone notices that you did
what you did, as long as you've

00:06:28.989-->00:06:33.093
throttled it and hid it like
you're supposed to, no one's
gonna notice. Uhm, you can get

00:06:33.093-->00:06:38.331
all this stuff out. Now if you
have a company with a really
awesome sock, who, uh, is going

00:06:38.331-->00:06:43.336
to bust you within like ten
minutes of you doing the thing
that you did - maybe you should

00:06:43.336-->00:06:48.174
hide in something else like we
talked a little bit about RTP -
if that's a normal part of your

00:06:48.174-->00:06:53.313
business, you know, RTP into
another machine; map the drive
and exfill data that way. It's

00:06:53.313-->00:06:58.418
super easy, you don't need a
tool to do it, uhm... and no
one's gonna really notice until

00:06:58.418-->00:07:04.057
later when they're like "Why is
this RTP session using so much
data?" Uhm, so, that's sorta

00:07:04.057-->00:07:07.460
stuff is really interesting.
There's some other stuff where,
like, uhm.. If they use a

00:07:07.460-->00:07:14.367
specific proprietary protocol, I
won't name any, uhm.. but you
can basically hide data in that

00:07:14.367-->00:07:21.074
by munging the protocol so if
there's a request that, like,
list files or something you

00:07:21.074-->00:07:26.079
could make it so that instead of
listing a directory it lists,
uhm.. a page 64 of the data

00:07:26.079-->00:07:30.517
you're "exfilling". You could do
some really cool stuff with
that. Uhm, so that's kind of the

00:07:30.517-->00:07:35.588
discrete way of doing that data
on the wire stuff. Uh,
third-party drops... Uhm...

00:07:35.588-->00:07:39.526
Obvious stuff is any
file-sharing service that will
let you upload the size of data

00:07:39.526-->00:07:45.799
that you have. Uhm.. again you
probably wanna throttle it, uhm,
and these are typically blocked

00:07:45.799-->00:07:51.271
at same proxy level or an egress
firewall. Like if these are
available to you, yea....

00:07:51.271-->00:07:56.643
that's.. that's like "Exfils
done, we don't need... we have
another problem, right?" Uhm,

00:07:56.643-->00:08:02.449
but Pastebin - how many of you
have Pastebin at work? Can you
get Pastebin ? See... yea...

00:08:02.449-->00:08:07.454
that's not a lot of hands -
that's awesome! So, we've
blocked Pastebin ... [laughter]

00:08:07.454-->00:08:10.724
What else is out there that you
could use? There's like twelve
other services that you could

00:08:10.724-->00:08:16.129
use that do exactly the same
thing and they're probably
unblocked, right? So doing it

00:08:16.129-->00:08:20.734
discretely, right, we can use
Flicker imager and do staggo;
put it inside a picture of a

00:08:20.734-->00:08:25.472
squirrel - done that, that's
awesome! [laughter] Uhm, those
two services in particular will

00:08:25.472-->00:08:29.676
let you upload things that are
completely losless - so you can
upload it and you can download

00:08:29.676-->00:08:34.080
it and all your stagnant data is
there. Uhm, there's simple
Python libraries that do all

00:08:34.080-->00:08:39.552
that stuff, uhm, the APIs change
constantly but if you keep up
with it, I mean, you can exfill

00:08:39.552-->00:08:43.123
data that way; and when it goes
out the firewall it looks like
you're uploading squirrel

00:08:43.123-->00:08:49.729
pictures which is super weird
but nobody's ever gonna ask you
"Why?". [laughter and chatter]

00:08:49.729-->00:08:55.869
So, Twitter and Facebook, I put
Twitter in the same category as
DNS - I kinda hate it as an

00:08:55.869-->00:09:01.041
exfill method cause a 140
characters is just too slow.
Uhm, and by the time you get any

00:09:01.041-->00:09:07.180
meaningful amount of data out
that wall, uhm... I mean, you're
gonna have to recompile it and

00:09:07.180-->00:09:12.152
get it all down and it's just no
fun. Uhm, Facebook though...
Facebook has this really cool

00:09:12.152-->00:09:17.123
thing called "Groups". Anybody
in a Facebook group? Where's the
moms in the room?... Cause I'm

00:09:17.123-->00:09:22.762
in like twelve. [laughter] Okay.
So Facebook groups let you
upload files and it is in the

00:09:22.762-->00:09:28.401
API to actually let you upload
files in Facebook groups. So I
create a fake Facebook account;

00:09:28.401-->00:09:33.206
I create a fake group with just
me in it and then I upload a
bunch of files. Uhm, you can

00:09:33.206-->00:09:38.244
totally do that, right? And most
of you at work Facebook''s
unlocked, I know the army does

00:09:38.244-->00:09:43.683
that, I know a lot of the DOD
companies do that because it's
required for business - in

00:09:43.683-->00:09:48.488
theory. Uhm, so you can't block
Facebook, you can't block
Twitter, can't block all these

00:09:48.488-->00:09:53.493
services that "I HAVE to use for
business; so I'll abuse them and
exfill data". It's cool. So

00:09:57.363-->00:10:03.503
kinda getting past that and
doing the airwaves stuff. Uhm...
[pause] A lot of folks think of

00:10:03.503-->00:10:07.173
this in the tempest realm,
right? We talk about, you know,
you have a room with a faraday

00:10:07.173-->00:10:10.643
cage on it, you're not gonna get
anything out of that room. We've
seen talks where they've done

00:10:10.643-->00:10:16.082
like fans where you spin the fan
at the right oscillation - you
can exfil data that way. I don't

00:10:16.082-->00:10:20.987
know anyone who has done that on
a pentest - has anybody actually
done that? Like tempest attacks

00:10:20.987-->00:10:26.726
for exfil.. on a pentest where
you have two days of sleep and
you really don't have the time

00:10:26.726-->00:10:33.233
to set that up? Yea, like you
can't do that - that's too much
effort for low return. But, what

00:10:33.233-->00:10:38.204
if you had a device you could
just plug in? So a USB port,
onsite, you broke-and-entered

00:10:38.204-->00:10:42.041
with your lock picks and your
little door tool and you
shimmied and you just plugged

00:10:42.041-->00:10:46.412
the tool in the back of the
machine and that was it. No WiFi
antenna, no, like, HID-device

00:10:46.412-->00:10:51.417
just a USB serial that you plug
in and all of a sudden you have
a remote connection. You could

00:10:54.921-->00:10:59.025
do a lot with that, uhm, you
could write code and do all
kinds of fun stuff; or you could

00:10:59.025-->00:11:05.198
just stream data over it, uhm,
serial out. Uhm... and the XP
radius that I have are like

00:11:05.198-->00:11:10.370
28mile range, they do mesh, uhm,
I have them in my hotel room if
anyone wants to see them I'll

00:11:10.370-->00:11:16.042
bring them. Uhm, I just need
breakout boards that don't suck.
Uhm... but the cool thing with

00:11:16.042-->00:11:21.080
that is you can build a mesh
network that went all the way up
"The Strip" and the chances of

00:11:21.080-->00:11:26.019
anyone being able to triangulate
each and every node, by the time
you are done exfilling data, is

00:11:26.019-->00:11:30.957
extremely low. Uhm, and these
things cost like... I think the
series that I'm using are like

00:11:30.957-->00:11:36.462
70 bucks, you can get 1mile
range ones for like 40, so
they're kinda like throwaway

00:11:36.462-->00:11:41.467
pentest devices - just strap it
to the back of a t-seed plug it
in, walk away. Uhm, hand radio

00:11:43.770-->00:11:48.775
stuff, you could do APRS, right?
Any hands in the room? APRS
messaging? It's totally illegal

00:11:50.777-->00:11:56.482
- don't do it! ...But you could
technically exfill over APRS,
right? [laughter] Cause it's

00:11:56.482-->00:12:01.354
just text, it's just text data,
it's digital. Uhm, I could just
say "Hey, my truck is here, my

00:12:01.354-->00:12:05.959
truck is here, my truck is in
Japan, my truck is here...".
Uhm, and you could use that to

00:12:05.959-->00:12:11.531
exfill data, uhm, and the cool
thing with that one is that you
can repeat it with internet

00:12:11.531-->00:12:15.301
repeaters and stuff like that -
you don't even have to be in the
country. Uhm, you could just

00:12:15.301-->00:12:20.306
exfill like that. And then
lasers - how many people are
fans of lasers? So basically use

00:12:22.408-->00:12:26.512
the laser mic techinique -
everybody knows what...
everybody don't know about the

00:12:26.512-->00:12:31.818
laser mic thing? Hitting the
laser as the glass, you feel the
vibrations from the glass and

00:12:31.818-->00:12:36.522
you read it digitally by
refelcting it off something. Do
that with data! Why not....

00:12:36.522-->00:12:41.461
right? I mean, that stuff's
insane and totally out of the
scope of pentest but it sounds

00:12:41.461-->00:12:47.000
really cool so let's put it
inside... [laughter] So all this
stuff is about attacking and

00:12:47.000-->00:12:52.138
breaking stuff but, uhm, what
does Putin say about all this
stuff, right? What do you do?

00:12:52.138-->00:12:57.543
You can't block Facebook, you
can't block Twitter, so what the
hell are you gonna do? So we can

00:12:57.543-->00:13:03.082
block N-points, we can block
individual malware N-points, we
can block some stuff, uhm, by

00:13:03.082-->00:13:08.755
URI or IP, right? So every time
I standup a fake service with
Pastebin code on it you block

00:13:08.755-->00:13:14.894
it, fine, whatever. Uhm, I can
block egress at the firewall by
the port protocol or application

00:13:14.894-->00:13:18.231
firewall or whatever, I can just
shut that down, whatever the
hell you're doing I'll just

00:13:18.231-->00:13:23.803
block it. Uhm, you can try to
detect anomalies and payload
size so, you know, look at the

00:13:23.803-->00:13:27.774
frequency, look at the "Hey, why
is this machine turning on at
three in the morning, going on

00:13:27.774-->00:13:32.879
Facebook and uploading 6GB of
data, like, why is that
happening? It doesn't make any

00:13:32.879-->00:13:37.450
sense." You can look for that
stuff and that's, that's cool.
Uhm, and you can block USB

00:13:37.450-->00:13:43.756
devices by classic deice ID.
[pause] Now, none of that stuff
works, uhm... Unfortunately

00:13:43.756-->00:13:48.861
blacklist just don't work, if
you've got a proxy at your
company - I won't name names -

00:13:48.861-->00:13:53.332
but a lot of them, like, you can
standup a new websites,
categorize it, get it approved

00:13:53.332-->00:13:59.105
through the proxy service and
it's good to go in 48hours. So,
you can standup your malicious

00:13:59.105-->00:14:03.676
website, looks like a "My Little
Pony" fansite - which is awesome
- and then have, like, a

00:14:03.676-->00:14:09.849
"/exfill" and just exfill data
to that. Like, just use your
Appache login to, just whatever,

00:14:09.849-->00:14:14.253
doesn't matter, just stream data
out. People think you just
really like "My Little Pony"

00:14:14.253-->00:14:18.391
and, you know, that's fine.
Please don't access that at
work, that's as far as the

00:14:18.391-->00:14:23.863
conversation goes, cool! Uhm, we
can disrupt normal business if
we start blocking stuff, so

00:14:23.863-->00:14:28.801
Facebook, Twitter, DropBox - a
lot of companies use that for,
you know, large file transfers

00:14:28.801-->00:14:35.775
anyway but if they have to use
it I can use it. Uhm, and that's
kind of like Moxie Marlinspike

00:14:35.775-->00:14:40.446
talks about the scope of choice
with Google and Facebook and
TIA, uh, and how you can't

00:14:40.446-->00:14:45.518
really not use Facebook if you
wanna be friends with everyone,
right? So, the choice is then

00:14:45.518-->00:14:50.389
"Do I interact with people or do
I, you know, just not
participate?" And that's what we

00:14:50.389-->00:14:56.763
wanna force people to do as
attackers, is to decide between
making money and preventing my

00:14:56.763-->00:15:02.268
exfill.. Uhm, and there's kind
of a balance there, uhm, and
it's for companies to kinda

00:15:02.268-->00:15:07.807
figure out what's more risky. In
context this protocol were
difficult to automate, you

00:15:07.807-->00:15:12.378
can... like you can do Deep
Packet Inspection - it's
awesome, right? DPI can do all

00:15:12.378-->00:15:16.883
kinds of fun things but if it's
inside a squirrel picture and
steggoed and all this other

00:15:16.883-->00:15:22.555
stuff, like, good luck telling
your system to do that. Uhm, you
might have the data in a pcap

00:15:22.555-->00:15:28.161
somewhere, that's fine, but if
you're gonna take my forty
thousand squirrel pictures and

00:15:28.161-->00:15:33.166
somehow decode them all you
should go play DefCon CTF...
[laughter] Uhm, USB device IDs,

00:15:36.803-->00:15:40.773
those don't work, there's a lot
of manufacturers that are just
repeating the same ID for

00:15:40.773-->00:15:45.945
whatever the hell that is. Uhm,
and it's.. each of those cost
money, so why would they pay for

00:15:45.945-->00:15:50.950
a USB device ID for a crappy
mouse you bought down the
street? Like, they're not gonna

00:15:50.950-->00:15:57.590
do that, so if you're trying to
block it by device ID it's just
not gonna work. So, weaponizing

00:15:57.590-->00:16:02.528
squirrels, uhm, "Squirrel" is
the name of a tool, a tool
that's not, uhm, ready today

00:16:05.198-->00:16:11.737
cause I suck at everything. It's
a Python 2.7 based application,
it will be MIT-licensed, uhm,

00:16:11.737-->00:16:15.341
you will be able to download it;
do whatever you want with it,
uh.. munge it, take it apart,

00:16:15.341-->00:16:20.479
uhm, steal code - I don't care,
like, the whole point is that
you'll be able to do exfill and

00:16:20.479-->00:16:25.785
it'll be easy. So, it ex tense
will be a simple module-based
plugins so all you have to do is

00:16:25.785-->00:16:30.890
write a little bit of the base
code, uh, for your module, for
your exfill channel, and all

00:16:30.890-->00:16:35.728
the, like, taking the file and
chunking it up, all that's taken
care of. All of the login, all

00:16:35.728-->00:16:39.999
of the... all the stuff you
don't wanna care about is done.
All you've got to do is write a

00:16:39.999-->00:16:45.938
"send" and "receive". Uhm, and
so you can put this on the box
that you've poned, executed with

00:16:45.938-->00:16:50.943
the CLI and exfill. That's it,
that's all you have to do. So
this is what it looks like when

00:16:53.112-->00:16:59.518
you execute it. Uhm, right now
it just has a.. you can put the
file in the channel you wanna

00:16:59.518-->00:17:03.856
use under the "Settings"
collection; and all the channels
are not committed to show what

00:17:03.856-->00:17:09.862
the settings are. Uhm, like for
"Imager" which is one of the
examples I used, you can put in

00:17:09.862-->00:17:14.233
the client-secret client ID and
then that's all you really need
for that one to exfill. So,

00:17:14.233-->00:17:21.007
uhm... cool! And that's what the
tool, the module, looks like,
it's really hard to read on this

00:17:21.007-->00:17:26.612
screen. So they told me that
this was a four by three
projector, uhm, but apparently

00:17:26.612-->00:17:32.985
have tons more space. Uhm, but
if you can see that at all, uhm,
all the stuff is just metadata

00:17:32.985-->00:17:39.091
saying "What the hell is this
thing? How big can my chunks be,
and, uh, what does it do?", and

00:17:39.091-->00:17:41.193
the rest of it is just "Send"
and "Receive". And all you have
to do is write "Send" or

00:17:41.193-->00:17:46.198
"Receive" and it'll work.
[pause] So, this is the URL that
the code will be available at

00:17:50.703-->00:17:56.075
soon as I stop being sick and my
family stops, like, almost
dying. Uh... you will be able to

00:17:56.075-->00:18:02.381
download the code at that URL,
obviously it's not available
today but... Uhm, closing stuff:

00:18:02.381-->00:18:06.852
stuff I wanna do. Uhm,
additional modules, obviously,
uh... because the demo's not

00:18:06.852-->00:18:11.490
done, it should work. [laughter]
Uhm, executable payload
generation with pi-installers,

00:18:11.490-->00:18:17.930
so doing kind of an MSF-thivim
thing uh.. to a MSF-post mudule,
longer range hardware, get with

00:18:17.930-->00:18:23.970
the Cloakify guy and shove that
stuff into my code; uh.. and
customized timing. All of these

00:18:23.970-->00:18:28.341
are super awesome because
they've contributed in some way
to me actually getting this done

00:18:28.341-->00:18:34.413
(slash) me being here. Uh,
Varacode especially... and
BSides, and DC407, and FamiLAB

00:18:34.413-->00:18:39.418
and all those cool people. Uhm,
and thank you... That's kind of
the talk. [applause]
