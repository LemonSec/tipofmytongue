00:00:00.767-->00:00:05.706
>> How's everyone else doing?
It's the last talk of the day.
[cheering] Still got a lot of

00:00:05.706-->00:00:10.711
energy? You know, I was, ah, the
first day I was streaming the
"101" track and there was a lot

00:00:15.716-->00:00:19.519
of people that were, uh, you
know, coming up here and, and
encouraging people not to go to

00:00:19.519-->00:00:23.023
the talks. They were like "Oh,
just... it's always uploaded on
YouTube, why would you go to the

00:00:23.023-->00:00:27.394
talks?" And I'm usually one of
those people, I'm usually the
person that thinks that you're

00:00:27.394-->00:00:32.266
crazy if you're gonna come do a
talk and stand in all those
lines. Mostly, it's the lines!

00:00:32.266-->00:00:37.271
Being from Wyoming, lines aren't
a thing, so, like, makes my
heart hurt when I see-hee people

00:00:37.271-->00:00:42.276
standing in the line. [pause]
Uh, but, I dunno, to encourage
people not to come to a talk,

00:00:46.313-->00:00:52.853
that's, uhm, that's not, uh...
I'd say it's misguided cause
there's something about being a

00:00:52.853-->00:00:57.591
part of an audience that's just
electric! And, you know, this is
no surprise, you know, you think

00:00:57.591-->00:01:03.230
about any sort of sitcom that's
out there, what do they do? They
pipe audience into your living

00:01:03.230-->00:01:07.734
room, they're piping, uh,
soundtracks into you, or ,uh,
uh, canned laughter into you

00:01:07.734-->00:01:10.904
just to make you feel that
you're doing the right thing. To
make you feel like "Oh, I

00:01:10.904-->00:01:14.841
shouldn't have to go make real
friends, uhm, I've, I've got all
the friends I need right here in

00:01:14.841-->00:01:19.413
my living room." [audience
noise] So, I mean, it kinda
makes you wonder, it's like...

00:01:19.413-->00:01:24.918
Oh, so first off - yea, thank
you, thank you for, uhm, braving
the, uh, colds and sinuses,

00:01:24.918-->00:01:29.923
infections and what not and,
uh... [sniff] Being here with me
today. Uhm... uh, yea so, uh,

00:01:33.593-->00:01:36.596
yea.. There's something electric
about being in the audience and
it, it makes you think, it's

00:01:36.596-->00:01:41.601
like... What is that? What is
that that is programming us to
like, to yearn to be a part of

00:01:41.601-->00:01:46.840
these social, uh, interactions,
and, you know, if, if things
like laughter, canned laughter

00:01:46.840-->00:01:52.846
can program us to act
differently then just how open,
how vulnerable are we? [pause]

00:01:52.846-->00:01:57.951
And I thought, yea, well, let's
just examine one of the hardest
cases that we know about and I'm

00:01:57.951-->00:02:03.790
talking about kernel version
Helen Keller. She was blind,
deaf and mute and look at

00:02:03.790-->00:02:08.295
that... she's still reading.
You're still piping input into
her - teaching her who knows

00:02:08.295-->00:02:15.168
what. [chuckles] [laughter] So
it's like if she's, she's the
most locked down system I could

00:02:15.168-->00:02:19.539
think of and if she's not locked
down, how wide open are we?!
And, you know, I'm joking but at

00:02:19.539-->00:02:23.076
the same time I'm really not
because we can't stop stuff from
coming into our eyes; we can't

00:02:23.076-->00:02:26.747
st... stop stuff from coming
into our ears, mostly. You walk
around Vegas, you're bombarded

00:02:26.747-->00:02:31.752
with stuff. [sniff] [pause] So,
yea... What's my motivation? I'm
a software engineer by day but

00:02:33.854-->00:02:38.792
I'm a frustrated consumer by
night, a media consumer. You
know, it's one of those things

00:02:38.792-->00:02:42.562
that, that you just feel icky,
you feel that, like, propaganda
is, is all over you, you know,

00:02:42.562-->00:02:48.502
and you can't escape it. Uhm, so
what can you do about it? You
figure that the people can do

00:02:48.502-->00:02:52.572
something about it are the ones
that are doing the propaganda to
begin with. You know, you can't

00:02:52.572-->00:02:57.677
expect anybody else to, you
know, come to your rescue for
you so I thought "Well, Python

00:02:57.677-->00:03:01.481
solves a lot of my other
problems, could Python solve
this problem for me as well?".

00:03:01.481-->00:03:06.486
So, I guess it's time to take a
journey. It's time to fight your
friends in alleyways...

00:03:09.289-->00:03:13.193
[laughter] ... tell them to put
on the glasses. And if you don't
get this, you haven't watched

00:03:13.193-->00:03:19.332
"They Live" and that's your
fault, you're wrong - not me.
[laughter] So let's define

00:03:19.332-->00:03:21.635
propaganda, propaganda's defined
in this talk, it's, uh, real
simple, you have node A, you

00:03:21.635-->00:03:23.637
have node B and you have a
communication stream or data
stream. This data stream is an

00:03:23.637-->00:03:28.642
attempt from node A to get node
B to behave in such a way that
directly benefits, or get node B

00:03:31.945-->00:03:36.950
to act in a way that directly
benefits node A. It's real
simple... [pause] And it goes by

00:03:43.356-->00:03:49.329
many names, you know,
advertising, lobbying, social
engineering - all of Las Vegas

00:03:49.329-->00:03:54.334
essentially, it's all one big
propaganda. [chatter] Uhg, go
away... [laughter] [pause] Yea,

00:04:05.545-->00:04:09.382
so propaganda is defined by this
talk, it goes by many different
names and, uhm, you're probably

00:04:09.382-->00:04:12.519
thinking "Oh, I do some of
these... am I a propagandist?"
Yea, you are. We all are, we all

00:04:12.519-->00:04:16.623
propagandize a little bit, for
sure. [sniff] And, it's, uh,
it's a level like what we're

00:04:16.623-->00:04:20.160
willing to tolerate, what we as
an individual, what we as a
society, what we're willing to

00:04:20.160-->00:04:24.664
tolerate as far as what we're
able to do with, or we're, what
we find acceptable in

00:04:24.664-->00:04:31.138
propaganda. But what about the
word? I'd like to give a little
history of the word, uhm...

00:04:31.138-->00:04:34.741
because none of these, none of
these word are a scary as
propaganda - "propaganda" is the

00:04:34.741-->00:04:39.479
only one that really is scary.
Maybe "social engineering" is a
little bit scary. But propaganda

00:04:39.479-->00:04:43.416
is the only one that's really
scary, you know, the one that's
always used as a pejorative and

00:04:43.416-->00:04:47.921
you gotta ask "Well, what's...
what's behind that?" there's
definitely reason behind that.

00:04:47.921-->00:04:53.393
Uh, propaganda you know, you
know, first came into vernacular
in like, you know, the mid, uh,

00:04:53.393-->00:04:58.398
in 1622. It was, it stood for
propagating the faith, uh, the
world was getting larger and,

00:05:01.001-->00:05:05.338
like, our ships could sail
further, the world was also
getting smaller and kingdoms and

00:05:05.338-->00:05:09.476
factions started to bump into
each other. And so you had,
like, this pope that's like

00:05:09.476-->00:05:13.480
"God, I don't wanna deal with
all this sh** that's on the
outer reaches of my kingdom, I'm

00:05:13.480-->00:05:18.985
just gonna...". He didn't say
that, he speaks Latin, and uh...
[laughter] He, uhm, he, uh, he,

00:05:18.985-->00:05:22.822
you know, he.. he stood up this,
uh, you know, propagation, this,
uh, propagation of faith and it

00:05:22.822-->00:05:28.094
became effective almost
immediately. In fact, like, the
guy that was in, you know, the

00:05:28.094-->00:05:32.232
cardinal that was in charge of
the propagation, you know,
committee, you know, he was, uh,

00:05:32.232-->00:05:35.769
he was known as "The Red Pope",
he was essentially an ad hoc
pope for all the external

00:05:35.769-->00:05:40.874
kingdoms out there - very
powerful. But even then, I mean,
it, it, it wasn't a pejorative,

00:05:40.874-->00:05:45.378
it didn't become a pejorative
until, like, as in a negative
connotation until World War I,

00:05:45.378-->00:05:50.517
after World War I. What's going
on there? [audience noise] Well,
World War I is, if, you know, if

00:05:50.517-->00:05:56.823
you.. I've listened to, uh,
George Collins, Dan Collins,
uhm, World War I history, uhm,

00:05:56.823-->00:06:02.062
if I, I highly recommend it.
But, uh, you know, he, he brings
out World War I was the first

00:06:02.062-->00:06:08.435
war, you know, major war in the,
in, uh, uhm, since like the
Napoleonic era. So you had this

00:06:08.435-->00:06:13.373
group of people, who, you know,
who weren't used to fighting,
and you had to get them spun-up,

00:06:13.373-->00:06:17.077
you had to get them hating the
other people. And Hitler wrote
in Mein Kampf, he wrote a whole

00:06:17.077-->00:06:20.614
chapter on war propaganda and
he's like "This is where we
failed, the English were, the

00:06:20.614-->00:06:23.650
English and the Russians they
were way better at this and
we've got to do a lot better".

00:06:23.650-->00:06:27.887
It was at this time also, and,
and... Hitler called it
propaganda, you know, he, he

00:06:27.887-->00:06:33.026
loved the word. And so that's
why it became a bad word here.
[sniff] Edward Bearnaise, uhm,

00:06:33.026-->00:06:38.732
uh... you know he's a father of
modern day propaganda, he wrote,
he looked at the same time

00:06:38.732-->00:06:42.502
period and he actually wrote in
his book propaganda, he
lamented, he goes "Propaganda is

00:06:42.502-->00:06:46.906
such a fine word and the Nazis
went and ruined it..." he's like
"Well, we've gotta come up with

00:06:46.906-->00:06:50.677
a different word." And the word
he came up with was "Public
Relations", you know, that's the

00:06:50.677-->00:06:55.682
term... [laughter] Did the
Germans learn their lesson?
Well, after World War II... was

00:06:59.019-->00:07:02.956
over, the, the liberators were,
how ever you wanna look at them,
were coming through, uh,

00:07:02.956-->00:07:07.961
Germany, and they came across,
the, this, uh... A man named
Robert Gaylin, Gellin... And

00:07:10.263-->00:07:14.134
they looked at his, uh,
anti-communism propaganda and
they were like "Man, this is

00:07:14.134-->00:07:19.172
good! Can you do this in
English?" And he was like "Ja...
I mean Yes...". [laughter] "I

00:07:19.172-->00:07:25.445
can totally do that". And, uhm,
it was very effective, we have
this, uh, retired CIA officer

00:07:25.445-->00:07:30.116
saying that we fed his
propaganda, you know, his anti-,
uhm, uh, anti-communism

00:07:30.116-->00:07:34.054
propaganda - the fed at
pentagon, the president's
office, you know, it was just,

00:07:34.054-->00:07:39.492
he called it, it was basically
bullshit; it was boogeyman
bullshit. [sniff] [pause] So

00:07:39.492-->00:07:43.430
yea, the Germans did lose, did
learn their lesson. And they
still lost the war but their

00:07:43.430-->00:07:50.303
propaganda machine was much
better, uhm, yea... Thanks for
sitting through that, uh, brief

00:07:50.303-->00:07:54.374
history... [audience noise]
Let's fast forward to, like, we
have the rise of the machines

00:07:54.374-->00:07:59.412
with propaganda - what has that
done? Now, you've probably heard
a lot of stuff about, like, how

00:07:59.412-->00:08:03.650
much it costs Google to power,
you know, to run their, you
know, just to pay their power

00:08:03.650-->00:08:08.521
bill every day. Probably heard
stuff about, you know, Target,
uh, you know, could predict

00:08:08.521-->00:08:13.793
the... predict when one of their
customers was pregnant - all
those kinds of stories. You

00:08:13.793-->00:08:18.298
know, there's these big numbers,
we're not really quantifying it
as a, as a human brains. But

00:08:18.298-->00:08:23.303
then I saw this, this, uh, this,
uhm, this really neat article
"The heterotopia of Facebook" -

00:08:25.839-->00:08:31.277
the thing is, Facebook, is a,
uh, doesn't really matter, this
could be any social, uh, uh,

00:08:31.277-->00:08:36.483
network out there; on,
especial.. especially online.
And, yea, go ahead and, go ahead

00:08:36.483-->00:08:41.087
and... I highly recommend
reading the "The heterotopia of
Facebook" and it, it describes

00:08:41.087-->00:08:47.460
what is going on with the human
brain very succinctly - we
participate in these social

00:08:47.460-->00:08:53.867
media groups. You know, these,
other spaces is what
"heterotopia" stands for.

00:08:53.867-->00:08:58.304
Heterotopia is where you can go,
it's a space that exists in real
life, but it's a space where you

00:08:58.304-->00:09:04.144
can go and kind of project and
live a sort of, you know, your
own utopia. The this is everyone

00:09:04.144-->00:09:08.648
else is doing the same thing, so
you can get curbstomped if you
go out there and project your

00:09:08.648-->00:09:14.254
idea; you can also get your
boots licked by a sicko fan.
What Foucault argues is that,

00:09:14.254-->00:09:19.959
like, whatever happens in these
heterotopias, if you're
investing real, uh, uh, parts of

00:09:19.959-->00:09:26.299
yourself into it every action
that happens inside of this
heterotopia will have an effect

00:09:26.299-->00:09:30.437
on you in the real world.
Because your brain really can't
distinguish between the two.

00:09:30.437-->00:09:35.108
It's like "If I was a dumbass in
there, why wouldn't I be dumbass
outside? And the answer is...

00:09:35.108-->00:09:38.711
[laughter] ... there's no
reason. There's nothing stopping
you, you are a dumbass.

00:09:38.711-->00:09:43.716
[laughter] That post? That was a
sh** post... [laughter] Your
whole life's been a sh** post.

00:09:47.554-->00:09:51.157
[laughter] You know?... So yea,
so let's say you have these
heterotopia, you have these

00:09:51.157-->00:09:55.094
spaces and you're a propagandist
and you, like, you know, a
salesman comes up to you and

00:09:55.094-->00:09:58.531
says "Look, I have these spaces
where people just come and live
their lives and interact with

00:09:58.531-->00:10:02.101
all these other people. And it's
like, it's like a direct
pipeline to how they act in the

00:10:02.101-->00:10:06.673
real world. Also,we've had
machines and we've recorded
everything, could this be of use

00:10:06.673-->00:10:12.178
to you?". "I dunno...
[chuckle]... I dunno if it'll be
worth my time..." says the

00:10:12.178-->00:10:16.850
propagandist. Obviously that's
not what they say! We know this
because, uhm, these industries

00:10:16.850-->00:10:22.822
are titans - uh, they're owners
of billionaires, uh, the people,
you know, are trying to wine and

00:10:22.822-->00:10:26.759
dine the owners all over the
place to try and get their
services on, you know, to be

00:10:26.759-->00:10:31.531
beneficial to them. So, yea,
these heterotopias, or these,
uh, social media groups, that

00:10:31.531-->00:10:36.236
collect all of our data that we
invest very real parts of our
lives in - it's a very

00:10:36.236-->00:10:42.609
important, it's very important.
[sniff][deep breath] Let's go
back to 1993, Al Gore was

00:10:42.609-->00:10:47.514
talking about, you know, this,
this idea of, like, the gap
between the "information haves"

00:10:47.514-->00:10:52.819
and the "information haves not".
He's warning, you know, if we
don't provide technology to ,

00:10:52.819-->00:10:57.824
you know, uh, poorer populations
they'll just get left behind.
Now, in his book... I mean,

00:11:00.360-->00:11:05.832
that's fine! That's a noble,
that's a noble thing to say. In
his book "Davis Mod... David

00:11:05.832-->00:11:10.837
Shank". He made a, he made a
really good point cause it... he
goes "It's one thing if you push

00:11:13.072-->00:11:17.844
technology on to a people but if
you don't upgrade the people, if
you don't teach the people, if

00:11:17.844-->00:11:23.316
you don't give them the proper
education of what it takes to,
you know, uh, to understand what

00:11:23.316-->00:11:28.788
these devices are and what data
they're producing, then you're
not helping the information gap

00:11:28.788-->00:11:33.693
at all. In fact, you might even
be widening it". So what's it
take to be "information have"

00:11:33.693-->00:11:37.430
and "information haves not"?
What's that gap? Well, the
information, to be an

00:11:37.430-->00:11:41.568
information have is not that
hard - if you know what a
tracking cookie is, if you...

00:11:41.568-->00:11:47.407
you know, you, you know why the
internet is making these people
billions of dollars, if you know

00:11:47.407-->00:11:50.777
those things; if you know what
an adblocker is, you're already
in the information haves. If

00:11:50.777-->00:11:55.615
you're, you know, one of these
fine outstanding citizens that
need stuff to just work out of

00:11:55.615-->00:12:00.553
the box - you're an information
have not. [pause] And, uhm, to,
uh... Whoops. [pause] Yea...

00:12:19.739-->00:12:23.042
[pause] Huh, I guess I can go
to, uh... Do we have any
examples of information gaps

00:12:23.042-->00:12:29.549
today? Yea, sorry... I think so!
I think one came up not too long
ago, in the aftermath of the,

00:12:29.549-->00:12:35.722
uh, the Orlando shootings, we
had a talk, uh, uh statement
from Hillary Clinton. [pause]

00:12:35.722-->00:12:39.659
She promised, you know, as
president "I will work with
great tech companies from

00:12:39.659-->00:12:45.732
Silicon Valley to Boston..." She
then goes on to uh, uh, give the
normal stump speech about

00:12:45.732-->00:12:49.202
intersecting ISIS's
communication, tracking and
analyzing their media posts,

00:12:49.202-->00:12:52.839
blah, blah, blah. We already
know that, there's already been
plenty of discussion about that.

00:12:52.839-->00:12:57.677
But, what I find interesting is,
as well as promoting credible
voices who can provide

00:12:57.677-->00:13:02.615
alternatives to radicalization.
She's asking Silicon Valley to
team up with them to promote

00:13:02.615-->00:13:08.688
credible.. credible voices.
Promote them, you know, whatever
voice you deem necessary. Why do

00:13:08.688-->00:13:15.561
I think this is, uh, an example
of the information gap? Because
I don't think she could have got

00:13:15.561-->00:13:21.301
away with saying something like
this: "As president I will work
with our great net, uh, New York

00:13:21.301-->00:13:26.439
Times' bestseller list,
promoting credible books and
authors who can provide

00:13:26.439-->00:13:32.845
alternative radicalization...".
And, so, yea, that's the
question, it's, like, why can,

00:13:32.845-->00:13:39.118
you know, why can, a, uhm, uhm,
what's the difference between,
you know, Silicon Valley

00:13:39.118-->00:13:43.723
promoting stuff on their product
and the New York Times promoting
books on their bestseller... uh,

00:13:43.723-->00:13:48.194
promoting books on their
bestseller list? It's one of
those things where, uh, you

00:13:48.194-->00:13:51.030
know, some people read this they
read about the government
messing with their books and

00:13:51.030-->00:13:55.435
they go "Hmmm, I don't think so.
You stop right there,
government!" [chuckles] Uhm, uh,

00:13:55.435-->00:14:00.373
uhm... uh why can we get social
media, you know the government
can, uh, you know, talk, you

00:14:02.975-->00:14:08.047
know, the presidential candidate
can openly talk about how she
would like, uh, you know,

00:14:08.047-->00:14:14.987
private companies to help
promote propaganda. [pause] And
this wasn't a one of thing

00:14:14.987-->00:14:19.392
either, we have this one story
you might have seen, uh, this
was in, uh, "Facebook and

00:14:19.392-->00:14:25.331
Twitter pledge to remove hate
speech within 24 hours" - this
was a story that was in Europe.

00:14:25.331-->00:14:30.269
And inside this article we see
that companies that also agree
to promote independent

00:14:30.269-->00:14:35.508
counter-narratives to fight hate
speech including content
non-discrimination, tolerance

00:14:35.508-->00:14:41.614
and respect. So, we this, you
know, we movements where
private, uh, companies are asked

00:14:41.614-->00:14:46.619
to, you know, produce
propaganda, you know, and uh,
are we okay with that? [pause]

00:14:49.889-->00:14:55.595
Alright... so we have, uh, we
have, like, we have this gap -
information haves and

00:14:55.595-->00:15:00.733
information have nots. The best
way to get information have nots
into the information haves class

00:15:00.733-->00:15:04.737
is for education. Just educate
them, just educate an
information have nots into a

00:15:04.737-->00:15:10.510
information haves and it's done!
The problem is, is that this
front's countered to what a lot

00:15:10.510-->00:15:14.447
of, you know, there's a lot of
people that, you know, in their
best interests are keeping

00:15:14.447-->00:15:19.552
information have nots. You know,
the more a information have nots
there are, the more ads, the

00:15:19.552-->00:15:24.557
better ads you can sell; or
target the people. And, uhm, you
know, the more surveillance you

00:15:26.859-->00:15:30.830
can collect on people, so, you
know, there's interests in
keeping the information have

00:15:30.830-->00:15:36.903
nots. [audience noise] Now you
say, "Well, if we were to
educate these people, what would

00:15:36.903-->00:15:40.907
it be?" Thank you very much,
that was a good transition to
the next slide... [laughter] So,

00:15:40.907-->00:15:45.912
I'm, uh, I'm pulling this from,
uh, a, uh, a lot of this is, uh,
uh, propaganda information from

00:15:48.314-->00:15:53.586
this book called "Firewall",
"Firewall: Propagandists guide
to self-defense". Jack Nolan

00:15:53.586-->00:15:58.591
was, uh, a PSYOP officer
himself, in the military, and,
uhm, if you don't know anything

00:15:58.591-->00:16:02.862
about the military - they have
these things called fuel manuals
and they are like command pages

00:16:02.862-->00:16:08.501
for war. If, you, you ever find
yourself in an apocalypse,
you'll wanna secure a volume.

00:16:08.501-->00:16:14.373
[sniff] Now, uhm, he's basically
going through the PSYOP, uh,
uhm, basically his training and

00:16:14.373-->00:16:20.446
he puts it all in this book. So,
first off, let's go and, like,
what's the propaganda steps? And

00:16:20.446-->00:16:25.518
we see here it's mostly like a
normal, uh, like a pen testing
step. [chatter] You know, you

00:16:25.518-->00:16:29.322
start off, like, dv audience,
you know, you wanna do some
footprint, you know what I mean?

00:16:29.322-->00:16:35.595
You wanna, you know, determine
what the audience's, uh, limits
are, what you CAN get them to

00:16:35.595-->00:16:40.132
do; what you CAN'T get them to..
to do. [sniff] You also wanna
determine who their ringleaders

00:16:40.132-->00:16:47.006
are. [pause] In today's, you
know, you know, in today's, you
know, social networks we have

00:16:47.006-->00:16:51.477
all these lights, we have
followers - it's easy to tell
who the ring leaders are - the

00:16:51.477-->00:16:57.149
end-users. But, also, you gotta
rem.. remember that you can also
target moderators, you can

00:16:57.149-->00:17:01.854
target sysadmins. A propagandist
may just, I mean, it's way
easier, what are you gonna do?

00:17:01.854-->00:17:06.192
You gonna target a group of
people or you can just target a
mod who can censor everything

00:17:06.192-->00:17:11.030
for you? If you want, I mean, if
you can get them onto your
side... Uh, the next thing a

00:17:11.030-->00:17:17.169
propagandist wants to do after
ID-ing his target audience - he
needs to, you know, uh,

00:17:17.169-->00:17:22.375
determine a goal state. Most of
the time goal state is to make
money, you know, but, we've got

00:17:22.375-->00:17:25.978
a lot of other things that that
goal state could be, you know,
to, uh, get people to hate the

00:17:25.978-->00:17:30.883
other people so you can go to
war. But mostly it's to make
money. The next thing you wanna

00:17:30.883-->00:17:36.822
do is scan for vulnerabilities,
on a society, on a group of
people that you'd like to, uh,

00:17:36.822-->00:17:42.061
you'd like to, uh, change their
behavior on. These are... you
can tell what a society's

00:17:42.061-->00:17:46.365
vulnerabilities are - these are
know as hot-button issues. If,
ever you're like "OOH, that's a

00:17:46.365-->00:17:49.735
hot-button issue" - that's a
societal vulnerability. That is
something that someone could

00:17:49.735-->00:17:53.906
always wedge in there, you know,
wedge a wrench in there and just
try to exploit. This can be

00:17:53.906-->00:17:59.845
race, religion, gender,
wealth... you know, these are,
uh, you know things that people

00:17:59.845-->00:18:04.817
are real sensitive about. And,
you know, it's upon the society,
it's up on the society to really

00:18:04.817-->00:18:08.287
patch these. You can't, you
know, if you're always gonna
leave this vulnerability open

00:18:08.287-->00:18:15.027
it's, you know, it's, it, uhm...
It'll always be exploited.
[pause] Choose the theme of the

00:18:15.027-->00:18:20.132
message - this is essentially
the exploit of the, how do you,
how are you gonna exploit the

00:18:20.132-->00:18:25.504
vulnerability? Are you gonna
appear.. appeal to fear? Are you
gonna appeal to greed? Ingroup/

00:18:25.504-->00:18:29.442
outgroup that's very powerful.
Like I said about people
yearning to be a part of a

00:18:29.442-->00:18:34.447
crowd. [pause] Uh, if you can
get people feeling like they're
an outgroup, you know, you can

00:18:36.549-->00:18:41.787
get people feeling like they're
an ingroup cause they continue
to do what you want them to do.

00:18:41.787-->00:18:45.391
[sniff] These are all different,
uh, this is your theme, this is
the message that you wanna run

00:18:45.391-->00:18:50.262
with, you wanna appeal to
something of your audience -
fear, greed, whatever. [pause]

00:18:50.262-->00:18:55.267
Now I actually wanna plan to
grab attention, this is
essentially like your payload

00:18:57.336-->00:19:02.642
that you're going to be
delivering. [pause] You know,
you're gonna have your TV

00:19:02.642-->00:19:08.247
commercials; you're gonna do
internet advertising [pause]
There are many to choose from...

00:19:08.247-->00:19:13.119
Next thing you wanna test the
message, measure it's impact and
adjust the message as needed,

00:19:13.119-->00:19:17.757
repeat. In today's day and age
this is very easy to do.
Obviously, this is uhm, you

00:19:17.757-->00:19:22.762
know, we get immediate feedback
on the message and its impact
and, uh, we can adjust it as

00:19:25.031-->00:19:29.935
needed very quickly, repeat it,
recoup, repeat it. So that's
what a propagandist is gonna do,

00:19:29.935-->00:19:35.608
that's his steps. What can a
propaganda, uh, what can a
person do to counter the

00:19:35.608-->00:19:40.713
propaganda? What kind of
checklist can they, can they,
can they use for themselves?

00:19:40.713-->00:19:46.585
[pause] A series of questions
that you can ask is can the
speaker gain anything from

00:19:46.585-->00:19:53.225
having me listen to them? You
know, if you're talking to
somebody and they, you know, you

00:19:53.225-->00:19:58.297
feel, you know, they f... they
feel that, like, "Yes, you know,
if I listen to them they have

00:19:58.297-->00:20:02.902
something that they can gain if,
you know, if I, if I listen to
them and, you know, believe what

00:20:02.902-->00:20:07.907
they say..." [sniff] [pause] Ask
if the source is verified.
Alright, so, when you're reading

00:20:10.676-->00:20:17.416
articles, uhm, pay attention to
what, uh, uhm, you know, who's,
you know, who's saying what.

00:20:17.416-->00:20:23.889
Sometimes you'll have an
unidentified source, uh, uh, you
know, these are good clues, so

00:20:23.889-->00:20:28.894
you know, white source. Is the
source identified? This is like
you know, you know who the

00:20:31.130-->00:20:34.733
author is. You know I'm the
journalist, you know, "Glenn
Greenwald, I'm publishing this

00:20:34.733-->00:20:39.739
article.". Uhm, uh, you know,
he's putting his name out there.
If a source is unidentified

00:20:41.841-->00:20:47.313
you'll see sometimes, like, uh,
for instance in, uh, the coo
that happened in Turkey, it was

00:20:47.313-->00:20:51.750
an unidentified source that
released, uh, you know, that,
uh, the president or the prime

00:20:51.750-->00:20:57.189
ministers or uh, was, you know,
he had uh, he had sought asylum
in Germany. [sniff] That came

00:20:57.189-->00:21:00.893
from iden.. that came from an
unidentified source and that's
something that you can look

00:21:00.893-->00:21:04.530
into, I mean, that's something,
that, uh, it's a very good clue.
If an iden... if an unidentified

00:21:04.530-->00:21:10.503
leak, you know, ha.. happens,
and the government tries to
chase them off to Russia, you

00:21:10.503-->00:21:14.974
can tell that that was not a
government, uh, uhm, sponsored
leak. Obviously they did not

00:21:14.974-->00:21:20.779
like that, however if the source
is an article and is not
identified and doesn't seem to

00:21:20.779-->00:21:26.318
be a big deal, you bet that that
was a sponsored leak. Like they,
you know, the government was

00:21:26.318-->00:21:31.323
okay with that one. [sniff]
[pause] And black as a source is
falsified, you know, some

00:21:31.323-->00:21:37.496
people, like Donald Trump, say
stuff that's never happened
before that is a black,uh, uh,

00:21:37.496-->00:21:42.101
verification. The source is uh,
a falsified source, he said
something that no one else has

00:21:42.101-->00:21:48.174
even said. [pause] You also
wanna ask if the source is
credible. Has the source lied to

00:21:48.174-->00:21:51.744
you before? Usually when a
journalist does something, like,
say that they're, they, you

00:21:51.744-->00:21:55.948
know... "they took, you know,
took rocket fire or they saw
combat in the area" you know

00:21:55.948-->00:21:59.618
they're done. They're, they're
no longer credible, there's no
reason for you to believe them.

00:21:59.618-->00:22:04.557
So asking them, keep track of
your source, uhm, uhm....
[pause] You know, have they lied

00:22:09.595-->00:22:15.201
to you before? Have they always
been truthful? You know, that
kind of thing. [pause] Ask if

00:22:15.201-->00:22:21.774
you've heard the message
repeatedly. If the me..
repetition is key to propaganda.

00:22:21.774-->00:22:27.813
It's, like, their best friend.
I, uh, I kind of feel, uhm, uh,
kinda reminds me of, like, the

00:22:27.813-->00:22:33.586
Unix touch command - when run
"touch" first it creates a new
file, right? What happens if you

00:22:33.586-->00:22:38.123
run it again on a file? Modifies
the end-time right? Modifies
that, modifies that modified

00:22:38.123-->00:22:43.829
time. And the way our brain
works is that we rely heavily on
modified time - when we go to

00:22:43.829-->00:22:50.236
search for something we like to
go to stuff to receive activity
recently. So, when you build a,

00:22:50.236-->00:22:55.241
when you send a message out
repeatedly... [pause] You're
building familiarity. We're, uh,

00:22:57.810-->00:23:03.515
we're uh, humans we love
familiarity. It means that
you're not a tiger that's here

00:23:03.515-->00:23:08.954
to eat me... [chuckles] You
know, you know it means that
you're, uh, uh, a friend, you

00:23:08.954-->00:23:14.026
know... And that's way
everyone's trying to push their
label or their commercials or

00:23:14.026-->00:23:18.330
their propaganda on you all the
time, repeatedly. That's why
it's a good sign, it's a good

00:23:18.330-->00:23:21.800
sign, that's why it's a good
clue - you're seeing the message
repeatedly, like, "Why am I

00:23:21.800-->00:23:25.070
having to see this repeatedly?".
Think about every time you go
into McDonalds - how many golden

00:23:25.070-->00:23:30.075
arches you see, they're trying
to build a familiarity presence.
[sniff] [pause] Alright,

00:23:32.478-->00:23:37.483
"Manufacturing consent". Uh,
this is a book written by a man,
uh, Noam Chomsky and Edward

00:23:40.319-->00:23:46.025
Herman, and it's coming from the
hypothesis that "The media
mobilizes support for special

00:23:46.025-->00:23:51.163
interests that dominate private
and state activity". Basically,
the media is not the forth of

00:23:51.163-->00:23:55.067
state is what they're deciding.
They're, uh, what they're
hypothesizing, they are

00:23:55.067-->00:24:00.005
hypothesizing that the media is
not this neutral thing - that
they will perform, you know, to

00:24:00.005-->00:24:04.943
the, to the needs of the special
interests of the society. And to
test this hypothesis, they is...

00:24:07.179-->00:24:12.718
they developed a propaganda
model. And what's in this
propaganda model? This...

00:24:12.718-->00:24:19.291
Alright, one of the things, it,
first propaganda filters the
size, concentration, ownership,

00:24:19.291-->00:24:25.197
uh, alright... God damnit...
[chatter] [pause] Size,
concentration of ownership,

00:24:25.197-->00:24:30.202
owner wealth, profit orientation
of dominant mass media firms.
So, in our beloved capitalist

00:24:33.405-->00:24:38.410
systems, uh, these media firms
and these businesses in general
they're allowed to grow, they're

00:24:38.410-->00:24:44.316
allowed to buy more... uhm, uh,
just everything around them. So
you can buy more media

00:24:44.316-->00:24:49.154
companies, you can, you know,
that's, uhm, you can buy more
things that aren't media

00:24:49.154-->00:24:52.991
companies and now you have, now
you have, like, uh, you know,
maybe something that's making

00:24:52.991-->00:24:58.397
money and you don't want your
media firm to be, you know, too,
uh, you know, to, uh, it's.. You

00:24:58.397-->00:25:02.267
have a business that's shady,
you don't want your media firm
bringing attention to it, you

00:25:02.267-->00:25:06.105
own both of them - that's great!
You can just tell the media firm
"Hey, shut up about this." and

00:25:06.105-->00:25:11.343
the media firm will be like
"Alright, you're the boss.".
[sniff] Advertising, as inc...

00:25:11.343-->00:25:18.250
as a main source of income -
this is nothing. So... when,
when media was just sold a

00:25:18.250-->00:25:23.255
subscription-only kind of a
thing.... [pause] Uh, the
government, uh, publications

00:25:26.125-->00:25:32.164
were allowed to talk a lot of
sh** about governments and a lot
of people in power. But, uhm, it

00:25:32.164-->00:25:38.003
was hypothesized, like, "Well,
if we just turn it over to the
market... and so maybe the media

00:25:38.003-->00:25:42.941
will sort itself out. Maybe
it'll get back in line, you
know, people won't be as, uh,

00:25:42.941-->00:25:48.447
anti-government." And it really
worked! And one of the ways, you
know, as soon as the advertising

00:25:48.447-->00:25:53.051
came in it allowed for, you
know, more rich people than you
know, the rest of the population

00:25:53.051-->00:25:58.290
to come in and, and, you know,
uh, kind of, sort of invest in
these media companies. Allowing

00:25:58.290-->00:26:03.228
them to grow bigger. [pause] And
so that's another way, if you
can't own the media what you can

00:26:05.898-->00:26:10.736
do is own part of the
advertising - that's a way that
you can get your own, kind of,

00:26:10.736-->00:26:17.109
check in balance and go like
"What message it the media
putting out there?". [sniff]

00:26:17.109-->00:26:20.746
[pause] And then we have this
idea of like reliance of media
on information provided by

00:26:20.746-->00:26:25.284
government experts funded by
primary resources. This is where
we get the idea of press

00:26:25.284-->00:26:30.989
conferences from. So, we have 24
hour news, and, you know, we
have uh, or at least news - we

00:26:30.989-->00:26:35.394
have a newspaper every day, we
have a news hour every day and
yea... we do have 24 hour news.

00:26:35.394-->00:26:40.399
How do they have news to give?
Well! This is where you know,
pre, you know, very powerful

00:26:43.202-->00:26:48.173
entities such as governments and
corporations can set up a press
conference. Like, "Oh, you want

00:26:48.173-->00:26:54.246
news? You can just come to this
location at this time, there'll
be coffee and donuts, we.. all

00:26:54.246-->00:26:58.517
you have to do is just listen to
us tell our side of the story".
And that's very important

00:26:58.517-->00:27:02.321
because now you have the
government and the media kinda
working together and, you know,

00:27:02.321-->00:27:05.424
you kinda hear about it, you
know, when, uh, you know,
someone, you know, some

00:27:05.424-->00:27:09.228
journalist, "goes", you know,
"goes rogue" and, uh, you know,
get's their, get's their

00:27:09.228-->00:27:15.634
credentials pulled for being
loud into the, the, you know,
the press conference. You know,

00:27:15.634-->00:27:20.672
so it gets, you know,
journalists, uh, to kind of stay
within bounds, so they can stay

00:27:20.672-->00:27:25.043
getting news from these press
conferences. And, also, think
about what this does, it's like

00:27:25.043-->00:27:30.549
you're on the other side of the
world and one of these entities
harms you in some way... You

00:27:30.549-->00:27:36.154
have to wait for journalists to,
like, fly over and stick a
microphone in your face. Where

00:27:36.154-->00:27:42.928
as in, with press conferences by
the time journalists gets across
sees to interview the victim,

00:27:42.928-->00:27:49.301
the, you know, on the home side,
you know, the, the big entities
they'll have had their opinions

00:27:49.301-->00:27:55.674
in, uh, in, uh, you know, the
public's sphere for who knows
how long? [sniff] [pause] You

00:27:55.674-->00:27:59.945
know, so, uh, so press
conferences are very beneficial
- they're very beneficial to

00:27:59.945-->00:28:04.349
both the media and, you know,
government and high power
entities that can, you know,

00:28:04.349-->00:28:08.453
afford to do these press
conferences for journalists.
Flack... flack is a way of

00:28:08.453-->00:28:14.393
disciplining the media, if ever
the media does something bad you
have to have ways that you can,

00:28:14.393-->00:28:20.299
uh, uh, tell the media, you
don't like that. Uh, one of the
ways you can do this, is, you

00:28:20.299-->00:28:26.038
know, you can have counter
stories, run, you can withdraw
your advertising - this kind of

00:28:26.038-->00:28:30.342
thing. You wanna make life
difficult for any media that
dare say something bad about

00:28:30.342-->00:28:35.614
you. Another thing that
propaganda model has, it's got
this thing called "boogeyman

00:28:35.614-->00:28:41.153
e..", "boogeyman enemies". When,
uh, manufacturing consent first
came out, you know, the

00:28:41.153-->00:28:44.890
communist was the boogeyman. And
the way they wrote it is like
they assumed that communism

00:28:44.890-->00:28:49.061
would be the boogeyman forever.
We have terrorists as the
boogeyman today, another

00:28:49.061-->00:28:53.832
boogeyman that we have, like
we've gone over before, is hate
speech. You know, hate speech is

00:28:53.832-->00:28:58.837
being used, you know, to get
social media companies to, uh,
help propagandize.... its users.

00:29:03.842-->00:29:07.879
[pause] [deep breath] Alright,
so we've learned some things
about propaganda, what can we

00:29:07.879-->00:29:13.452
do? Well, I decided to make a
Reddit column, why did I make a
Reddit column? Well because I'm

00:29:13.452-->00:29:17.089
addicted to Reddit, alright?
[chuckles] [audience noise] And,
uhm, you know, my friend told,

00:29:17.089-->00:29:21.493
he was like "That's doing weird
things to your brain...". I
didn't listen and so now it's

00:29:21.493-->00:29:25.364
the only one I can solve
problems... [laughter] Becau....
well I mean, the theme on Reddit

00:29:25.364-->00:29:30.102
though - it's a very organised
website and so if you can get
rid of the people it's very

00:29:30.102-->00:29:36.241
pleasant. [laughter] And, you
know, if you think about, like,
"I wanna better, my, my media

00:29:36.241-->00:29:41.413
consumption..." you know we're
all familiar with this, you
know, this, concept of

00:29:41.413-->00:29:46.385
end-to-end encryption. You don't
want things in the middle, you
know, we want things "end" to

00:29:46.385-->00:29:51.390
"end"... So could we do the same
thing to, uh, to, uh, our media
consumption? Can we get as close

00:29:53.659-->00:29:58.864
as possible to the knowledge
source without having, you know,
all these grubby paws in there

00:29:58.864-->00:30:05.137
trying to change the message?
And the other thing that Reddit
does... yea I get through the

00:30:05.137-->00:30:10.075
mods and admins, this is huge!
Like... uh, I, don't... Reddit
has a lot of drama that gets

00:30:10.075-->00:30:15.280
kicked out cause of the mods and
admins did something that was
seen as censorship. Uhm, luckily

00:30:15.280-->00:30:20.218
I have not had to do any of that
because I don't go to those
weird sub-rights, but, you know,

00:30:20.218-->00:30:26.124
they've got a point. Mods and
admins can just choose to do
stuff, uh, against your, uh,

00:30:26.124-->00:30:32.497
against your will, is... do you
want that in a news source?
[pause] Also, it's open source

00:30:32.497-->00:30:38.704
with a very easy install script.
And it's got this, you know,
Python, the Python prom module

00:30:38.704-->00:30:45.343
is a, is a very decent, uh, uh,
module for, you know, scripting
your Reddit bots. I dunno why it

00:30:45.343-->00:30:50.716
keeps coming on... [laughter]
So, I just stoodup this Digital
Ocean droplet, it's running

00:30:50.716-->00:30:56.655
Ubuntu. This is, uh... the
Reddit install script and it,
uh, you can, you know, can run

00:30:56.655-->00:31:01.660
it on like whatever version, you
know, Ubuntu, or whatever that
can support it if you're brave

00:31:01.660-->00:31:06.064
enough, you can tweak it to your
heart's desires. But, like, if
you want life easy and, you

00:31:06.064-->00:31:10.535
know, something like Digital
Ocean and, uh, will make it that
easy, you can just select

00:31:10.535-->00:31:16.074
whatever install Reddit shell's
looking for and BAM! Within 15
minutes, uh, uh, Reddit column

00:31:16.074-->00:31:23.014
up and running. [pause] I wanted
to leave the Reddit code alone,
you know, once I got up and

00:31:23.014-->00:31:27.018
running, I was like "Alright,
that's fine.". So then I just
used "pra" and "bottle", any..

00:31:27.018-->00:31:33.992
anyone here use bottle? It's
very lightweight Python, uh,
uhm, framework. It's like, it's

00:31:33.992-->00:31:39.531
very lightweight, it's stupid
simple API, I can just send
commands at it and it'll just

00:31:39.531-->00:31:46.404
send commands at my Reddit
clone. [pause] Also, I use this
thing called "summary API".

00:31:46.404-->00:31:52.177
Summary API was a life sent
cause I had only scrapers, you
know, stuff like the natural

00:31:52.177-->00:31:55.647
language, you know, toolkit out.
And you know, Parsey
McParseface... [audience noise]

00:31:55.647-->00:32:00.819
Came out not too long ago,
right? So I was like "Wow, I can
do all this stuff". But then!

00:32:00.819-->00:32:05.824
Luckily, summary comes out and
was like "I do all that for
you". Plus... [pause] Uhm... you

00:32:08.527-->00:32:13.899
know, I don't have to... uh, I
mean, what it'll do, it'll go
out, you'd send it a link or

00:32:13.899-->00:32:20.539
even send a text and it will run
an analysis on it and pull out
the important sentences. You

00:32:20.539-->00:32:24.442
know, this is literally, if
you've ever seen, like, a "Too
Long; Didn't Read" bot it's

00:32:24.442-->00:32:31.049
probably using this exact site.
It's, it's great at just taking
the article pshh and munching it

00:32:31.049-->00:32:34.786
down to however many sentences
you want - you can munch it down
to a tweet, you know, if you

00:32:34.786-->00:32:40.725
wanted to. [sniff][pause] So
yea, I was very happy to uh, uh,
know about these guys I relied

00:32:40.725-->00:32:46.731
on heavily. Also, look, I'm a
slow reader, so if I can just
shorten articles - look, I'm

00:32:46.731-->00:32:51.970
either gonna run a 10 sentence
synopsis of this article or I'm
not gonna read it at all.

00:32:51.970-->00:32:57.843
[chuckle] [audience noise] So,
thanks summary! [pause] Alright,
yea... Everybody ready for an

00:32:57.843-->00:33:03.982
exciting demo? Look, it's
Reddit, don't get too excited.
[chuckle] [laughter] So, this

00:33:03.982-->00:33:09.788
is, yea, so when I said it was
very simple - that was a lie.
Where are you guys now? Uh...

00:33:09.788-->00:33:14.793
cause I killed some of my bots,
but I have one bot up and
running. [pause] Oh, God damnit.

00:33:18.463-->00:33:23.468
[pause] So, yea, it's uh... it's
very simple, like, whatever, you
know, whatever, uhm... [pause]

00:33:30.008-->00:33:35.013
Whatever domain, uh, the a, the,
the article came from that's
gonna be the "sub-Reddit".

00:33:37.015-->00:33:42.420
Whatever author wrote it,
that'll be the "user". So, you
know, Reddit's a great way, you

00:33:42.420-->00:33:45.023
know, you can select, you know,
all of the things that were
published by ... all the things

00:33:45.023-->00:33:49.895
that were published by that
author and, you know, that part
of the organization is done

00:33:49.895-->00:33:54.199
automatically. [deep breath] So
the next thing you can do is,
like, let's take a look at this,

00:33:54.199-->00:34:01.039
uh, uhm... [pause] Summary
because that's what we're
looking at here. So, I dec, I

00:34:01.039-->00:34:06.978
did away with titles, you know,
the, the journalists aren't the
ones that decide the article's

00:34:06.978-->00:34:13.084
title, that goes to the editor.
The editor wants to, uhm, you
know, he wants people to click

00:34:13.084-->00:34:18.390
on it. He's gonna make it "click
baity". [laughter] So, get rid
of it. Like I said, if we want

00:34:18.390-->00:34:22.761
end-to-end, why not just get rid
of that? He's gonna try to get
you to click on it, so get rid

00:34:22.761-->00:34:27.766
of it. And so... what I have is
just the top, the, the first 300
integers, or 300 characters, I

00:34:31.303-->00:34:37.409
mean... is for it's limit. So
that's, you just, that's my
title. So I read the first, you

00:34:37.409-->00:34:42.247
know, the first couple of
sentences. And we're gonna load
it... Or not. [audience noise]

00:34:42.247-->00:34:47.252
Oh, shoot, oh well. [pause] I
had one loaded up here. [pause]
>> If you reset the various

00:34:51.756-->00:34:56.761
wireless prompts, you may not be
on the right one. >> I thought I
was on "DefCon". Oh, wow.... no,

00:35:06.338-->00:35:11.343
no, no. [pause] Uhg, oh okay...
Well I realize I'm all... Geez,
you all are, are so kind, I'm

00:35:25.056-->00:35:30.061
gonna be over, waaaay over.
Alright, real quick... [chatter]
Let me just go over this, tips

00:35:32.831-->00:35:36.601
for reading internet comments:
DON'T read internet comments.
[laughter] Alright... alright,

00:35:40.705-->00:35:44.843
first off, it's not do, doing
good stuff for your health,
alright? You get upset, you

00:35:44.843-->00:35:49.481
know, it's raising your blood
pressure, you're using your free
time, or work time, you know...

00:35:49.481-->00:35:53.918
[laughter] Probably someone on
the other end is getting paid
for that, alright? So you're

00:35:53.918-->00:35:58.923
hurting yourself. Not only that
but we're seeing more of this,
you know, first off [chuckles].

00:36:01.226-->00:36:05.830
If you're Russian you're a
troll, you know, but you're, you
know, you're uh, Facebook

00:36:05.830-->00:36:10.301
warrior if you're British.
That's some interesting
propaganda in and of itself.

00:36:10.301-->00:36:16.007
But, we're seeing more of these
things called "Astroturfers" or
"Trolls", or whatever you want

00:36:16.007-->00:36:21.513
to, uhm, very many names. Uhm...
[deep breath] And that's very
powerful, it's like, you know,

00:36:21.513-->00:36:25.483
you're talking to a somebody,
you know, like we talked about,
in your heterotopia. You're

00:36:25.483-->00:36:30.321
talking with someone and you
thinks it's real but they're not
real, and so... Also, I like

00:36:30.321-->00:36:36.294
this, it's, like, you know,
Russia has the troll army but,
you know, we're gonna go look

00:36:36.294-->00:36:41.499
at, uhm... We're gonna have an
internet stranger tell me who I
should vote for. That's above

00:36:41.499-->00:36:46.504
board... So, you know. Even if
you think you're the best
internet debater in the world,

00:36:48.673-->00:36:54.312
you don't have an incentive, you
don't have a money incentive on
the line... But that's not, I

00:36:54.312-->00:36:59.217
would argue that that's not the
main reason you shouldn't argue
with internet trolls and the

00:36:59.217-->00:37:04.122
main reason I think comes from
the "Correct a record". This was
Hillary Clinton's super pack,

00:37:04.122-->00:37:10.795
they were talking about like
"Yea, we astroturf people." And,
in the statement "Lessons learnt

00:37:10.795-->00:37:14.966
from online engagements, Bernie
Bros, during the democratic
primary will be applied to the

00:37:14.966-->00:37:19.471
rest of the primary season and
the general election". I mean,
it's even if you think that,

00:37:19.471-->00:37:22.440
like, you're, you're, you're
getting good ideas out there and
you're throwing them out

00:37:22.440-->00:37:25.977
there... you're really not.
You're just helping them, you're
building their knowledge base,

00:37:25.977-->00:37:30.982
uh, and you're helping them get
better. It kinda reminds me of,
uh, uh, like, Rick and Morty

00:37:33.318-->00:37:36.588
when it comes to like those
little micro verses, you know...
[laughter] You, know, they're

00:37:36.588-->00:37:40.058
able, you know, you have like
this internet and you're in
your, uh, your little thread and

00:37:40.058-->00:37:43.261
you're just... but really all
you're doing is speeding up
their test and you're speeding

00:37:43.261-->00:37:48.500
up their, their knowledge of how
to, uh, uh, propagandize the
rest of the population. Because

00:37:48.500-->00:37:53.538
as they, you know, come out of
that, uh, out of your thread
they come into the real world

00:37:53.538-->00:37:57.942
and they're like "We have just
the commercial for you...".
[laughter] Alright, so just

00:37:57.942-->00:38:02.747
don't, however... Alright, if
you do insist on reading
internet comments or if you

00:38:02.747-->00:38:09.521
wanna comment with somebody,
take out the public part of it.
Take out the vanity part of it,

00:38:09.521-->00:38:15.693
you know, with, whether it comes
to up vote or, uh, retweets or
any of that, just take all that

00:38:15.693-->00:38:20.632
and go to dm or pm, you know,
see about that. You know, I
think most people you know

00:38:20.632-->00:38:25.637
they've been most of, uh...
accepting. They'll talk to you
on dm, on the dl. [audience

00:38:30.175-->00:38:33.745
noise] So, and if you want, if
you're interested some
documentaries I recommend "The

00:38:33.745-->00:38:37.815
manufacturing of consent", it's
about three hours long. Uh,
that, this is a documentary on,

00:38:37.815-->00:38:43.821
uh, uh, Noam Chomsky,it goes
over a lot of his theories on
propaganda. "Century of self" is

00:38:43.821-->00:38:48.960
about Ed Bernays, this is the
