00:00:00.000-->00:00:05.005
>>Alright. 2017 is the year of
Linux on the desktop. Uh, lets
give Mr. Levinson a hand!

00:00:18.318-->00:00:23.724
>>Yeah, Anyone want to know why
it took so long to switch from
VGA to HDMI, now you know the

00:00:23.724-->00:00:28.729
answer. Alright folks, my name
is Ladar Levinson. Uh, for those
who don't already know who I am,

00:00:31.765-->00:00:35.769
I'm the owner and the operator
of Lavabit, an encrypted email
service that suspended

00:00:35.769-->00:00:40.774
operations in 2013 after being
forced to become complicit in a
'man in the middle' attack. Yeah

00:00:43.877-->00:00:48.882
I'm that guy. The last couple of
years, I've been working on dark
mail but that is a talk for

00:00:57.591-->00:01:04.131
another day. What I'm here to
talk about today is really to
give you guys a crash course in

00:01:04.131-->00:01:10.771
compelled decryption law. For
technical terms, just how the
Department of Justice is using

00:01:10.771-->00:01:17.611
the courts to force people to
decrypt their data at gunpoint.
Over the past three years, I've

00:01:17.611-->00:01:23.283
become an expert on compelled
decryption law. I had to learn
this information the hard way.

00:01:23.283-->00:01:28.922
Hopefully by sharing it with you
guys here today, I'll help some
of you avoid some of this pain

00:01:28.922-->00:01:35.562
in the future. Now before I get
started, I'd like you to take
note that I've compressed this

00:01:35.562-->00:01:40.567
presentation into approximately
3000 seconds. Huffman encoding
rules do apply. This means it

00:01:43.136-->00:01:49.276
may feel that you're drinking
from a well-endowed fire hose,
which looks something like that.

00:01:49.276-->00:01:52.980
But if you're at this conference
and you're attending my talk, or
you're taking the time to watch

00:01:52.980-->00:01:58.185
this at home, you're probably
smart enough to drink in this
information without the help

00:01:58.185-->00:02:03.123
from a sippy cup. The problem is
easy to express. The Department
of Justice has been pwned by a

00:02:06.059-->00:02:11.064
bunch of perverts. More
specifically, what I'm saying is
that the DOJ has been taken over

00:02:13.066-->00:02:18.505
by a group of individuals who
derive sexual gratification from
manipulating the law to achieve

00:02:18.505-->00:02:23.510
a specific end. Whether those
ends are a benefit or a
detriment to society is in the

00:02:29.950-->00:02:35.455
eye of the beholder. I shall
leave that for you to decide.
What I'm here to talk about

00:02:35.455-->00:02:40.460
today are the legal doctrines,
or shall I say the doctrinal
versions being used to attack

00:02:42.529-->00:02:47.634
encryption technologies. The
issue stems from the believe
which is slowly pr-

00:02:47.634-->00:02:52.939
proliferating throughout the
ranks of government and law
enforcement that they're

00:02:52.939-->00:02:57.944
entitled to all of our data. And
when I say our data, I don't
mean the cypher text. I mean the

00:02:59.980-->00:03:04.985
plain text. You should also know
the DOJ blames the infosec
community and our efforts to

00:03:07.254-->00:03:14.161
improve the security and privacy
of information as being the
problem in and of itself. The

00:03:14.161-->00:03:20.600
bigger the barrier, the greater
their demands for assistance.
The DOJ believes it can use the

00:03:20.600-->00:03:26.873
courts to compel decryption
and/or conscript others to
assist them in defeating it. If

00:03:26.873-->00:03:33.113
you subscribe to their belief,
then the DOJ is entitled to any
information which might assist

00:03:33.113-->00:03:38.118
them in their investigation. The
DOJ has argued they can use
existing statutes to seek

00:03:40.153-->00:03:45.158
assistance which in case of -
where congress has not
explicitly prohibit- prohibited

00:03:47.561-->00:03:53.233
a specific action. They like to
view the all writs act and some
of the other generic language in

00:03:53.233-->00:03:59.072
the statutes as effectively
being a blank check. The only
thing standing in their way to

00:03:59.072-->00:04:05.378
date, is the courts willingness
to exercise its authority. This
might be a good opportunity to

00:04:05.378-->00:04:10.383
tell you that about 60% of the
sitting judges were former
prosecutors. My goal here today

00:04:13.286-->00:04:18.291
is somewhat modest. You should
know going into this, that in
order to exercise your rights,

00:04:20.360-->00:04:27.067
you may have to go to jail. My
hope is that by sharing some of
this information with you today,

00:04:27.067-->00:04:32.405
I will increase the possibility
or the probability that you will
be released should you find

00:04:32.405-->00:04:38.678
yourself on the wrong end of the
gavel. My second goal, is to arm
you with enough knowledge to

00:04:38.678-->00:04:44.184
have an intelligent conversation
with your lawyer. If they tell
you your choices are to comply

00:04:44.184-->00:04:49.189
or go to jail, you should
probably look for a different
attorney. And thats because

00:04:51.324-->00:04:56.329
knowing is half the battle. Now
I'm going to cover two major
areas of law, and I figure it's

00:04:58.532-->00:05:04.371
good to start out by defining
the terms since first party and
third party aren't typically

00:05:04.371-->00:05:10.911
terms you hear while standing
next to the company watercooler.
'First party' refers to

00:05:10.911-->00:05:16.650
situations where the government
seeks to compel decryption from
a suspect, in other words, to

00:05:16.650-->00:05:22.422
force them to decrypt their own
data. 'Third party' refers to
situation where the government

00:05:22.422-->00:05:27.427
seeks to conscript a company,
like Lavabit, my own, or Apple,
or any of the other secure

00:05:31.198-->00:05:37.904
communications companies, or
secure data storage companies
out there to assist them in

00:05:37.904-->00:05:42.909
accessing encrypted information
without the user's assistance.
It's cutting off my notes.

00:05:51.685-->00:05:56.423
What's a presentation without at
least a few problems. If you're
wondering who the "second party'

00:05:56.423-->00:06:01.361
is, it's the government. Its
worth noting that a common
strategy is to convert first

00:06:06.800-->00:06:11.805
parties into third parties by
granting them immunity. The key
phrase to remember here is

00:06:13.974-->00:06:19.779
derivative use immunity. If you
believe the government is
honest, then typically

00:06:19.779-->00:06:24.784
derivative use immunity is what
you need to protect you. Your
lawyer can explain the rest. On

00:06:28.922-->00:06:34.527
the other hand, you believe law
enforcement is dishonest, and
will use the information they

00:06:34.527-->00:06:41.034
obtain against you regardless of
where they- they got cued onto a
particular line of the

00:06:41.034-->00:06:46.039
investigation, then no amount of
immunity can truly protect you.
You may find it surprising to

00:06:49.476-->00:06:55.782
know there is no law on the
books that specifically grants
law enforcement the right to

00:06:55.782-->00:07:02.522
compel decryption. You might
find it equally surprising to
know we have no right to privacy

00:07:02.522-->00:07:07.527
here in the United States. What
we have is the Forth Amendment.
Which protec- protects our homes

00:07:11.398-->00:07:18.171
from search and seizure without
probable cause. Now the
government has been very careful

00:07:18.171-->00:07:23.176
to distinguish that from a right
to privacy. Yeah. I'm only going
to give you half the

00:07:28.815-->00:07:33.820
presentation. Hmm. There also
aren't any supreme court cases
yet which deal directly with

00:07:36.389-->00:07:43.296
compelled decryption. What we're
going to be talking about are
the handful of district and

00:07:43.296-->00:07:49.102
circuit court decisions which
attempt to draw from older
supreme court decisions which

00:07:49.102-->00:07:54.207
involve corollaries in the
physical world to make
extrapolations about how they

00:07:54.207-->00:08:00.747
should handle encryption in the
modern day. What's important to
understand about the law is that

00:08:00.747-->00:08:06.753
only the decisions by the
supreme court are binding upon
the entire country. Decisions by

00:08:06.753-->00:08:13.026
an appellate court in a specific
circuit, would be binding upon
all of the courthouses in that

00:08:13.026-->00:08:18.031
particular circuit. Feel free to
pick out your own state and see
which circuit you happen to fall

00:08:22.068-->00:08:27.073
in. This isn't to say that
decisions in other circuits
aren't relevant. Quite the

00:08:30.110-->00:08:37.083
contrary. Judges will often
consult the opinions from other
circuits before making their own

00:08:37.083-->00:08:42.088
decisions. Now before I jump
into the cases involving
encryption I thought it would be

00:08:46.226-->00:08:51.231
worth starting with two older
supreme court cases which have
been heavily cited in all of the

00:08:53.299-->00:08:58.304
modern day cases. The first is
Fisher v United Stated and it
comes from 1976. It gives us the

00:09:03.443-->00:09:08.848
closest thing we have to a fifth
amendment right against self
incrimination by being forced to

00:09:08.848-->00:09:13.853
decrypt our data. In this
particular case, a individual
was being forced to surrender

00:09:19.292-->00:09:24.297
documents and what the court
said is that the fifth amendment
would not be violated by the

00:09:27.000-->00:09:32.705
fact alone that the papers on
their face might incriminate
someone. For the privilege

00:09:32.705-->00:09:38.445
protects a person only against
being incriminated by his own
compelled testimonial

00:09:38.445-->00:09:44.284
communications. Because the
documents were created
voluntarily, the court held they

00:09:44.284-->00:09:49.422
could not be considered
compelled testimonial evidence.
In other words all of the

00:09:49.422-->00:09:54.961
information on your hard drive
already was created voluntarily,
and therefore as far as the

00:09:54.961-->00:09:59.966
courts are concerned, is subject
to subpoena or search. The only
thing standing in its way is the

00:10:02.168-->00:10:07.173
ability to access it. Now in Doe
v United States in 1988, we get
the origin of the current

00:10:12.011-->00:10:18.618
testimonial doctrine. In this
supreme court decision, the
court held that a statement is

00:10:18.618-->00:10:24.524
testimonial when the government
compels the individual to use
the contents of his own mind to

00:10:24.524-->00:10:30.396
explicitly or implicitly
communicate some statement of
fact. Now I don't know about

00:10:30.396-->00:10:35.401
you, but I keep my passwords in
my brain. Some people even call
that my mind. Other people say

00:10:39.806-->00:10:44.811
its my girlfriend. She's the one
who makes all of the decisions.
This particular decision is

00:10:48.581-->00:10:53.586
rather important because what it
says is it draws a distinction
between information that exists

00:10:56.122-->00:11:01.094
only in your head, versus
information that might be
somewhere else in the physical

00:11:01.094-->00:11:06.099
world. Now what we get from a
much more modern case that
actually derived from uh the

00:11:09.502-->00:11:14.507
Clinton's little whitewater
scandal, everyone remember that
from the 1990s, is that knowing

00:11:20.313-->00:11:25.318
the location of a particular
document is in and of itself
testimonial. How this gets

00:11:28.354-->00:11:33.359
implied to encryption is that
the information on the drive is
not protected. What's protected

00:11:36.462-->00:11:41.467
is whether or not you have
access to it. If you can decrypt
it, and the government can prove

00:11:44.504-->00:11:50.677
that, then effectively your
fifth amendment protections
begin to fall away. Keep that in

00:11:50.677-->00:11:55.682
mind when you find yourself
being questioned by law
enforcement. If the government

00:11:58.651-->00:12:03.590
can claim that the production of
the information is a foregone
conclusion then it holds no

00:12:06.492-->00:12:11.497
testimonial value and thus they
can force you to decrypt the
information. The first case we

00:12:16.669-->00:12:21.674
have to talk about which
directly involves encryption
involved Sebastian Boucher and

00:12:24.077-->00:12:29.616
his father as they attempted to
cross the Canadian border into
the United States. In this

00:12:29.616-->00:12:34.654
particular case, one of the
officers found a laptop in the
backseat, and without needing to

00:12:34.654-->00:12:40.827
enter a password, he was able to
access approximately 40-->000
files on the laptop, some of

00:12:40.827-->00:12:46.633
which appeared to contain
pornographic images. An ICE
special agent then investigated

00:12:46.633-->00:12:51.137
further by investigating
thousands of images of
pornography including one

00:12:51.137-->00:12:56.142
labeled in a way to suggest it
was child pornography. The
laptop was powered down and when

00:12:58.444-->00:13:03.983
the investigators tried to power
it back up, they realized they
could no longer access it

00:13:03.983-->00:13:08.988
because it was encrypted. In
this particular case, they
already knew what was on the

00:13:11.791-->00:13:16.796
drive, the only only question
was for the courts to consider
was whether or not Boucher's

00:13:18.865-->00:13:23.870
knowledge of the password was in
fact testimonial. In other
words, we create this doctrine

00:13:31.210-->00:13:37.850
of reasonable particularity. If
the government can prove that
you know how to access the

00:13:37.850-->00:13:42.855
information and it knows what
information it's seeking ahead
of time, then it can force you

00:13:44.957-->00:13:51.931
to decrypt your hard drive. In
this particular case the
government's initial request was

00:13:51.931-->00:13:56.936
thrown out. It was n- later
narrowed by the prosecutor such
that he only required an

00:14:00.506-->00:14:06.846
unencrypted version of the drive
and he sought approval of the
magistrate judge based on the

00:14:06.846-->00:14:11.851
forgone conclusion doctrine we
discussed earlier. The district
court reversed this decision

00:14:18.424-->00:14:23.129
saying that you don't need to
know the specific contents of
the files. You just need to be

00:14:23.129-->00:14:29.969
able to demonstrate that the
files exist. In other words, the
investigator saw the file names

00:14:29.969-->00:14:34.974
and was able to use that to make
a- to overcome the particularity
or specificity requirements.

00:14:45.184-->00:14:51.691
What that means is that you may
want to start encrypting the
names of your files in addition

00:14:51.691-->00:14:56.696
to the files themselves. This
particular example was taken
from one of my favorite

00:14:59.232-->00:15:04.170
ransomeware applications. Nice
to see they're doing some good.
The next case we have to talk

00:15:10.309-->00:15:15.314
about goes all the way to 2013.
In this particular case, agents
raided a suspect's home and

00:15:19.152-->00:15:24.157
seized a hard drive containing
files which indicated they might
contain child pornography.

00:15:26.325-->00:15:32.298
Initially the demand to decrypt
the data was rejected by the
court. But upon further review

00:15:32.298-->00:15:37.770
the judge reversed himself after
the prosecutor demonstrated
ownership and access to the

00:15:37.770-->00:15:43.176
encrypted data by showing the
drive contained personal
financial information belonging

00:15:43.176-->00:15:49.982
to the suspect, he was able to
prove ownership. You should keep
this in mind and share this with

00:15:49.982-->00:15:54.987
your fellow Deacon attendees who
like decorating their computers
with identifying marks. For

00:15:58.624-->00:16:03.563
example, if you're Bob Hoskins
and this is your notebook you
might have a hard time denying

00:16:06.632-->00:16:12.939
that it's yours. Or Daniel
Radcliffe would have a pretty-
would need some pretty potent

00:16:12.939-->00:16:19.478
magic to deny this was his
computer. Jenifer Lawerence who
we know recently learned the

00:16:19.478-->00:16:24.483
value first hand of encrypting
your sexy selfies and her
collection of carious dick pics,

00:16:26.619-->00:16:31.624
might have trouble denying this
was her laptop. In this situat-
oh. Moving on to another case

00:16:37.296-->00:16:43.970
which takes us back to a circuit
court decision and this is one
of the few decisions we have at

00:16:43.970-->00:16:48.541
the circuit level, remember
which means that its been
binding upon the entire eleventh

00:16:48.541-->00:16:53.546
circuit, involved the situation
where the government obtained a
warrant to search a hotel room

00:16:55.748-->00:17:00.686
for any electronic devices found
in possession of John Doe. They
suspected Mr. Doe of sharing

00:17:02.989-->00:17:09.262
kiddie porn. Porn. Certain
portions of the drive couldn't
be examined by the FBI because

00:17:09.262-->00:17:14.934
they were encrypted. A grand
jury subpoena was issued which
required Doe to produce the

00:17:14.934-->00:17:21.073
unencrypted contents of the hard
drive. Doe claimed fifth
amendment- his fifth amendment

00:17:21.073-->00:17:27.580
right against self
incrimination. In other words,
he tried to exercise the fifth

00:17:27.580-->00:17:33.986
amendment in order to protect
him from being forced to
testify, that testimonial

00:17:33.986-->00:17:40.526
exception we talked about
earlier. The government
unilaterally gave him active

00:17:40.526-->00:17:45.097
production immunity to
circumvent the claim and thus
forced him to decrypt the

00:17:45.097-->00:17:50.102
information. Later on, the
appellate court went back and
reversed the decision. Saying

00:18:04.684-->00:18:10.323
that the government had not
reached the standard of
reasonable particularity that is

00:18:10.323-->00:18:15.061
required. In other words, it
must prove it knows the
existence and location of

00:18:15.061-->00:18:20.199
encrypted files and offer
reasonable evidence to suggest
the encrypted files will contain

00:18:20.199-->00:18:25.204
the incriminating evidence.
Unfortunately part of the slide
is cut off. Windows... I like to

00:18:29.075-->00:18:34.080
blame Microsoft for everything.
Precisely what qualifies as
reasonable particularity remains

00:18:39.251-->00:18:44.323
an open question. For example,
if the government knew a
spreadsheet found in a file

00:18:44.323-->00:18:51.297
called "corporate financials"
would that qualify as reasonably
particular in a tax evasion

00:18:51.297-->00:18:56.302
case? We have one of our best
tests of this particular
doctrine of law currently taking

00:18:59.572-->00:19:04.510
place in Philadelphia. In this
particular case, this suspect, a
Philadelphia police sergeant who

00:19:08.614-->00:19:13.619
we shall call 'Galileo' was
relieved of his duties and has
refused to unlock two hard

00:19:16.522-->00:19:21.527
drives that were seized from his
home more than seven months ago.
He has since been found in

00:19:23.562-->00:19:28.768
contempt of court for refusing
to decrypt the drives and
currently sits in jail awaiting

00:19:28.768-->00:19:34.673
a decision by the appellate
court. In this particular case,
the evidence against him

00:19:34.673-->00:19:39.678
consists of a sister who claims
she saw images and videos on the
drive that were of underage

00:19:43.816-->00:19:48.821
individuals posing in a
pornographic nature. A
subsequent forensic exam of his

00:19:52.224-->00:19:57.229
Mac found a single image of a
young, approximately 12 year old
boy in a bathing suit. Now

00:20:02.601-->00:20:07.606
what's interesting about this
particular case is that they
managed to decrypt the Mac by

00:20:13.879-->00:20:18.884
accessing his iPhone 5s which he
gave them the pin code to
voluntarily, after which

00:20:23.456-->00:20:28.461
investigators searched the phone
and found an app on there,
what'd they call it, 'Secret

00:20:32.998-->00:20:37.603
Apps' that was supposed to have
protected his information. In
other words, don't believe

00:20:37.603-->00:20:43.476
everything you hear about the
protection of you information.
They managed to circumvent the

00:20:43.476-->00:20:48.481
security of this particular app
and they found a screenshot of
the recovery key for his Mac

00:20:48.481-->00:20:53.486
Pro. They were able to use that
to access the Mac. Like I said
earlier, the only incriminating

00:20:56.722-->00:21:02.828
evidence they found on the Mac
was that singular image that may
or may not have been of an

00:21:02.828-->00:21:07.833
underage boy who was not naked
but close to it. They also found
evidence in log files that he

00:21:09.935-->00:21:14.940
had visited various groups
called Toddler CP, Loli-Cam
Hussy, Child Models, a few

00:21:17.843-->00:21:22.848
others that I can't even
pronounce. Collectively, they
used that as the evidence

00:21:25.718-->00:21:30.723
against him to compel decryption
of the two external drives. As I
said, the case is currently

00:21:34.059-->00:21:39.064
pending. What this particular
case introduces is something
that I want to make you guys

00:21:44.470-->00:21:49.475
aware of here today. When you
print out, or save off a
recovery key, it is subject to

00:21:52.845-->00:21:57.683
subpoena and or search by the
government if they can prove its
existence and know its

00:21:57.683-->00:22:04.490
approximate location. Now for
those who don't know, a recovery
key, and in this case I'm using

00:22:04.490-->00:22:10.663
BitLocker from Microsoft, is
basically an alternative to your
password. In the case of

00:22:10.663-->00:22:15.668
BitLocker it's a 48 digit
number, which by my math is
approximately a 160 bit key.

00:22:19.805-->00:22:25.644
Now, what is important to know
is that initially, when
BitLocker first came out, the

00:22:25.644-->00:22:31.550
FBI was quite concerned about
it. But when they realized that
every user who was going to use

00:22:31.550-->00:22:37.790
it was going creating a paper
copy that would circumvent it,
and the FBI could thus search a

00:22:37.790-->00:22:42.795
person's home and find the
recovery key, it became far less
of a concern. As we move into

00:22:45.164-->00:22:49.735
this next area of law, it's
important to understand the
supreme court has held that

00:22:49.735-->00:22:54.273
certain physical acts involving
the surrender of a physical
object is not considered

00:22:54.273-->00:23:00.379
testimonial, and thus not
subject to protection from the
fifth amendment. Giving a blood

00:23:00.379-->00:23:06.185
sample or providing a voice ex-
sample, have not been considered
testimonial as they do not

00:23:06.185-->00:23:11.190
require the suspect to disclose
any knowledge he might have
about his or her- her guilt.

00:23:13.759-->00:23:20.099
What this means is that anybody
who likes the iPhone touchID
isn't very safe. Which is

00:23:20.099-->00:23:25.104
probably about two thirds of
you. What you need to do, is
compa- com-eh- combine it with a

00:23:30.576-->00:23:35.214
piece of information that is
locked away inside your gray
matter. Something like a pin

00:23:35.214-->00:23:40.219
code. But unfortunately what
we're learning is that even a
pin code isn't necessarily safe

00:23:42.621-->00:23:46.992
because the vendor can be
compelled to modify the product
and make it susceptible to a

00:23:46.992-->00:23:53.132
brute force attack. We'll talk
about that more in a little
minute- in a- in a couple of

00:23:53.132-->00:23:58.137
minutes. What this all means is
that what you really need to do
is pair your biometric token

00:24:00.572-->00:24:07.046
with a strong password, at which
point you should probably start
to ask, what is the point of

00:24:07.046-->00:24:12.051
using your fingerprint in the
first place? I'll just briefly
say that if an external person

00:24:17.289-->00:24:21.927
or organization can access the
information necessary to decrypt
your information, in all

00:24:21.927-->00:24:27.533
likelihood they will be forced
to surrender it. Turning over
user data or data created as a

00:24:27.533-->00:24:32.805
derivative of a user accent-
actions is what I call ordinary
assistance, and has been common

00:24:32.805-->00:24:39.712
for quite some time. Some of the
most simple language that
describes this is CALEA, which

00:24:39.712-->00:24:45.050
we don't have time to cover.
Instead what were going to talk
about is Smith v Maryland very

00:24:45.050-->00:24:51.924
briefly. Its a case from the
1970s which involved a pen
register order that was placed

00:24:51.924-->00:24:58.630
on suspects device without first
receiving a warrant and the
supreme court later came back

00:24:58.630-->00:25:04.636
and said it was legal because A)
the information being collected
was normally collected by the

00:25:04.636-->00:25:11.176
phone company and B) there was
thus no expectation of privacy.
That expectation of privacy

00:25:11.176-->00:25:16.181
phrase is key. As a result of
that particular ruling, congress
decided to pass the pen

00:25:20.886-->00:25:27.559
registered trap and trace
statutes. Now it's important to
understand that these particular

00:25:27.559-->00:25:32.564
statutes were passed when this
is what a pen registered device
looked like. There is no way

00:25:36.402-->00:25:42.241
they could have conceived of
encryption at that time, let
alone that the language they had

00:25:42.241-->00:25:48.247
written, which required
providers to provide assistance
with the installation of this

00:25:48.247-->00:25:53.919
device as including the
necessary and requisite
authority to demand an

00:25:53.919-->00:25:58.924
encryption key, unless you're in
the Department of Justice. Now,
that expectation of privacy is a

00:26:04.763-->00:26:09.768
key phrase because it's the
phrase the government has been
using to steadily and slowly

00:26:09.768-->00:26:14.773
chip away at all of our
collective rights. This
particular court opinion ruled

00:26:17.476-->00:26:23.215
that email communications
weren't private because somebody
assumes the risk that they will

00:26:23.215-->00:26:27.853
leak once they share them. Now I
don't know about you, but I
consider my email pretty

00:26:27.853-->00:26:34.426
private. The fact that it isn't
is probably something that
should be shared starting with

00:26:34.426-->00:26:39.431
Hilary Clinton. [Applause] Now,
now, before I show this next
slide, I'd like to do a little

00:26:45.270-->00:26:50.609
poll. Can everyone please raise
their hand that thinks the
information on their personal

00:26:50.609-->00:26:55.614
computer is private. Go ahead,
raise it. Keep your hands up.
Now for all those folks with

00:27:00.185-->00:27:05.190
their hands up, how many of you
also connect your computer to
the internet. Looks pretty

00:27:08.560-->00:27:13.565
unanimous to me. Well, according
to this particular judge in the
eastern district of Virginia,

00:27:15.901-->00:27:19.505
the fact that you connect your
personal information to the
internet means that you have no

00:27:19.505-->00:27:24.510
expectation of privacy. I'm
wondering if you can quote him
when you get brought up on

00:27:28.313-->00:27:33.318
charges for breaking into his
computer and sharing all his
information. [Applause] Its

00:27:36.288-->00:27:42.928
kinda how we work in this world.
Interestingly enough, my own
case happened to occur in the

00:27:42.928-->00:27:47.099
eastern district of Virginia so
I'm sure my attorney who is
sitting out there amongst you

00:27:47.099-->00:27:52.104
will be happy to explain this to
this judge when he gets back
home. Now I'd like to briefly

00:27:54.673-->00:28:00.379
talk about my own case. I don't
have enough time to go through
all of it, but back in 2013 the

00:28:00.379-->00:28:05.217
FBI sought to access encrypted
emails that were stored on the
Lavabit servers, but which were

00:28:05.217-->00:28:09.555
encrypted using a scheme which
made it impossible to access
without knowing a users

00:28:09.555-->00:28:14.259
password. Because the messages
were encrypted with the user's
private key and the private key

00:28:14.259-->00:28:20.766
was secured with the user's
password, the FBI sought to
intercept that password by

00:28:20.766-->00:28:25.771
compelling the disclosure of TLS
key and then conducting a 'man
in the middle' attack. Once they

00:28:29.908-->00:28:35.514
had the password, they could in
combination with the encrypted
user data and the source code,

00:28:35.514-->00:28:40.519
reverse the encryption process.
I think that's my lawyer calling
me telling me to shut up. To

00:28:43.589-->00:28:48.393
justify this action the FBI
relied on three different
authorities: the power to

00:28:48.393-->00:28:52.998
subpoena, which they later
withdrew, the technical
assistance of the pen registered

00:28:52.998-->00:28:59.137
trap and trace statutes, mind
you that particular language was
written when the device I showed

00:28:59.137-->00:29:04.076
previously was state of the art
and by relying on the the stored
communications act by claiming

00:29:07.145-->00:29:11.016
that the encryption key
belonging to the business was
somehow associated with the

00:29:11.016-->00:29:16.922
particular user, and that I
couldn't be the one to collect
the metadata because not only

00:29:16.922-->00:29:22.828
did they not trust me, but that
I couldn't provide it to them in
real time. Instead, they

00:29:22.828-->00:29:28.600
thought- sought to access the
information themselves. Now it
doesn't take a rocket scientist

00:29:28.600-->00:29:33.639
to realize they probably wanted
to do more than they were
actually authorized to do.

00:29:33.639-->00:29:39.978
Because as Mr Haden points out,
once you have access to a
network, you implicitly have the

00:29:39.978-->00:29:44.983
ability to modify the
information that goes across it.
We have a second case to discuss

00:29:49.087-->00:29:54.092
which made a number of headlines
earlier this year and it
involved the mobile phone. While

00:29:57.562-->00:30:03.201
an initial reading of the
headlines may have made the case
seem innocuous, a careful

00:30:03.201-->00:30:08.206
reading showed the true colors
of the litigation. Specifically,
that the FBI was relying on a

00:30:11.910-->00:30:16.915
law from 1789 to claim that they
had the authority to compel
Apple to modify their products

00:30:21.620-->00:30:27.025
so that their security could be
bypassed. Now while I can't
prove it, it certainly wouldn't

00:30:27.025-->00:30:31.730
surprise me to learn that the
DOJ attorneys who devise this
particular strategy were

00:30:31.730-->00:30:38.203
assisted by a powerful
hallucinogenic. After all, any
attorney can make a good

00:30:38.203-->00:30:44.009
argument. Only an honest one
will tell you what the odds of
actually winning that argument.

00:30:44.009-->00:30:49.481
But the DOJ, they have an
approximate annual budget of
around 27 billion dollars and

00:30:49.481-->00:30:55.587
over a hundred and ten thousand
people on the payroll. They can
afford to take some uh- leaps of

00:30:55.587-->00:31:00.525
faith. The rest of us on the
other hand, have to pay for our
indulgences. Like the Lavabit

00:31:06.264-->00:31:10.335
case, the DOJ sought to use
Apple's source code and
encryption keys to circumvent

00:31:10.335-->00:31:15.340
encryption, and then blamed the
resulting litigation on Apple,
making their products more

00:31:19.644-->00:31:25.951
secure. Now, I originally
entitled this lec- this
particular section, "How far

00:31:25.951-->00:31:30.956
will they go?" but in June the
target of my particular case was
unsealed so I decided to change

00:31:33.925-->00:31:38.930
it to how far did they go in
their pursuit of Mr. Snowden in
my particular case. Now Snowden

00:31:43.235-->00:31:48.607
has stated on several occasions
that he would be willing to
return to the United States and

00:31:48.607-->00:31:52.811
face a jury of his peers and
receive punishment for his
crimes, but he doesn't believe

00:31:52.811-->00:31:59.117
that he would receive a fair
trial. I can attest to that
fact. Because I appeared before

00:31:59.117-->00:32:04.055
the very same judge and across
from the very same prosecutor
that he would face. Now, I'd

00:32:06.124-->00:32:11.129
like to start my exhibits by
showing you this particular
order to show cause for failing

00:32:13.231-->00:32:19.671
to allow the installation pen
registered device, but as this
email show here, and this one,

00:32:19.671-->00:32:24.843
and this one, I was willing to
let them install the device. I
just was not willing to let them

00:32:24.843-->00:32:30.081
have my encryption key, after
all, that is the whole point of
encryption, is to protect

00:32:30.081-->00:32:36.955
against eavesdropping. Now when
I indicated that I was going to
retain a lawyer, and object to

00:32:36.955-->00:32:41.960
it in court, what did the
Department of Justice do? Well,
first of all, they claimed they

00:32:44.930-->00:32:49.000
weren't able to speak to me,
even though I have that email
record proving that I was in

00:32:49.000-->00:32:55.440
constant contact with them, on
average of about every other
day. Then, they went to another

00:32:55.440-->00:33:00.846
judge in the same district and
sought an order to install the
tap upstream with my service

00:33:00.846-->00:33:05.851
provider before I showed up in
court. I had to sue in order to
get this particular document.

00:33:08.153-->00:33:14.259
And as these particular records
show, installed it two days
later, well before I even flew

00:33:14.259-->00:33:19.264
to Washington D.C. Yet, when I
arrived, they did not inform the
court or myself that they had

00:33:23.068-->00:33:28.073
already installed the particular
device. They continued with the
proceeding and insisted that I

00:33:30.809-->00:33:36.514
was not in compliance. Now I
have more evidence here, but
unfortunately I have run out of

00:33:36.514-->00:33:41.519
time to go over it. So, I shall
have to skip over all of these
slides, and go to this one. I

00:33:49.728-->00:33:55.200
shall endeavor to close with a
bit of prose. Perhaps more
blokes would still be with their

00:33:55.200-->00:34:00.739
folks if history was considered
dope. Live, love, learn what
floats your boat, so long as you

00:34:00.739-->00:34:05.744
remember to vote. Question those
with power, meh, I can't read. I
hate- ok. There, um. Because we

00:34:16.721-->00:34:21.493
the geeks all know the speech
with great size, comes great
pleasure. Now help me teach the

00:34:21.493-->00:34:27.265
freaks that bigger keys will
deliver encrypted bits, which is
sure to give snoopy the fix. Its

00:34:27.265-->00:34:32.537
a promissory note for feeling
more pleasing than a motorboat.
Now go forth and feel free to

00:34:32.537-->00:34:37.542
quote. That is all. [Applause]
