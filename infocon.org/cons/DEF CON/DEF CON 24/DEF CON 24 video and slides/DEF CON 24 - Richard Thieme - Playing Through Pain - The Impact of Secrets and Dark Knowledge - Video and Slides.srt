00:00:08.909,00:00:14.181
[applause] >>Playing Through the
Pain: The Impacts of Secrets in
Dark Knowledge. >>Thank you. At

00:00:14.181,00:00:19.186
21 years and uh- one day I'll
get a real job. It'll be great.
Uh- in those 21 years, not only

00:00:24.057,00:00:30.364
has it been a privilege, an- an
incredible privilege uh- to be
able to speak in this space on

00:00:30.364,00:00:36.937
behalf of the higher values of
this community, but to become
friends and colleagues with so

00:00:36.937,00:00:42.676
many incredible people. And over
the years, many of them have
shared the stories of their

00:00:42.676,00:00:47.681
lives which include the details
of what kinds of consequences
this kind of work can have under

00:00:52.552,00:00:57.557
extreme conditions. Uh- when I
say this kind of work, I mean
security work and intelligence

00:01:01.094,00:01:06.099
work on behalf of governments,
corporations or ad hoc fleeting
organizational structures. In

00:01:10.771,00:01:15.776
all of those years, many of them
have shared stories about the
trauma that they genuinely

00:01:18.011,00:01:24.051
experienced, both because of the
internal dynamics of the systems
of which they worked, as well as

00:01:24.051,00:01:30.424
things that befell them. And how
they could or could not, because
of the systemic dynamics deal,

00:01:30.424,00:01:37.264
effectively or not, with the
consequences of those
situations. And I've decided

00:01:37.264,00:01:44.237
after 21 years, and especially
at this advanced age, and
especially not uh- having job-

00:01:44.237,00:01:49.242
having job security now, which
is not worrying about that stuff
in the same way, to tell the

00:01:51.912,00:01:57.551
truth as much as I can about
what I have heard, and suggest
strategies for dealing with the

00:01:57.551,00:02:03.957
inevitable discoveries along the
way for many of you, of what
this work can do to a person.

00:02:03.957,00:02:10.530
Not to everyone, and not in the
same ways, but as a result, this
talk is very personal, uh- and

00:02:10.530,00:02:15.869
very deeply felt and I hope it
doesn't sound like a sermon
because it's not intended to be

00:02:15.869,00:02:22.142
moralistic. I'm not going to be
suggesting that I have any high
moral ground because I don't.

00:02:22.142,00:02:28.982
I'm affected by the work both
others and myself, my own as
well, so there is no moralism in

00:02:28.982,00:02:34.988
this. It's wanting to take us a
serious clear look at what we
have created in the national

00:02:34.988,00:02:40.027
security state and the parts
that make it up. And what so
many of the unseen consequences

00:02:40.027,00:02:46.333
are. When I asked for input and
feedback about this topic, a
number of people said, this is

00:02:46.333,00:02:52.172
something that is never
discussed aloud out here. And it
is discussed inside, and you

00:02:52.172,00:02:57.344
know what I mean by inside, only
in constrained ways that suit
the mission and intent of the

00:02:57.344,00:03:02.749
organizational culture, not
necessarily the authenticity,
integrity and freedom of the

00:03:02.749,00:03:08.755
individual human being. So if
you walk into CIA, you will see
the slogan, the truth shall set

00:03:08.755,00:03:15.295
you free. Uh- a very different
way of interpreting the words of
Jesus Christ. But ones that for

00:03:15.295,00:03:20.467
the institution have been
effective, in terms of guiding
the mission. Well I'm going to

00:03:20.467,00:03:25.572
pick up on those words and try
to deliver some of the truth
that sets us free as well and

00:03:25.572,00:03:31.645
I'll need to be explicit. 21
years ago, when I first spoke
here, I told the young people I

00:03:31.645,00:03:38.518
saw, and the number of kids in
the kid's group, the risk group
that I spoke to yesterday

00:03:38.518,00:03:45.425
equalled the number of people at
the entire conference at DefCon
4. Uh- a little less than 400.

00:03:45.425,00:03:50.831
And this year I understand there
are about 25,000. And I said to
the young people, who in those

00:03:50.831,00:03:55.836
days looked like hackers. That
is, wore the uniform of a more
outlawed band than you see

00:03:58.371,00:04:03.310
habitually today around the con.
I said if you want to hack, come
in under the cover os NSA. Come

00:04:05.879,00:04:12.219
in under the cover of CIA. You
will get the best tools, you'll
be taught the best techniques,

00:04:12.219,00:04:18.191
and you'll get cover for during
what would otherwise be illegal
actions everywhere in the world,

00:04:18.191,00:04:23.196
except this country. And all
that has changed about that is
now of course it includes this

00:04:23.196,00:04:28.201
country as well. But I didn't
know exactly to what I was
inviting people. It was true,

00:04:31.872,00:04:35.775
but I did not understand the
full implication of what it
would mean to make that

00:04:35.775,00:04:40.780
commitment to doing that work.
And I want to make a disclaimer,
this is not an attack, or uh-

00:04:43.316,00:04:48.822
intelligence agency bashing or
anything like that. The people
I've worked with who are

00:04:48.822,00:04:53.827
colleagues in those places uh-
are generally good well
intentions people. This is about

00:04:56.696,00:05:01.635
systemic issues that the entire
system has generated in and of
itself. Uh- I'm not the first on

00:05:03.937,00:05:08.675
to know that things are
different once you start doing
the work, than before you did

00:05:08.675,00:05:13.980
it. Obama has said the rhetoric
he used during his campaign
about how he would change the

00:05:13.980,00:05:19.953
instrumentality of surveillance
and intrusion came immediately
up against the rocks of reality,

00:05:19.953,00:05:24.591
the first day he was handed the
intelligence briefing in the
oval office. Because any pain

00:05:24.591,00:05:29.696
human being given that briefing,
and the ten biggest threats
against us, however you define

00:05:29.696,00:05:35.202
us, would say what would you do
to stop these. And when you get
the answer, we can do x, we can

00:05:35.202,00:05:41.007
do y, we can do z, anyone of us
with uh- a burdens and
responsibility protecting this

00:05:41.007,00:05:46.012
country would say then you do
that. And so he did. And so he
gave up a lot of the idealistic

00:05:48.215,00:05:53.220
rhetoric about what he intended
to do because he discovered he
couldn't do it, not in good

00:05:55.689,00:06:01.194
conscience. So, what we're
talking about is people
dedicating themselves through

00:06:01.194,00:06:06.399
security and intelligence work,
i.e. you and your work, to
bailing out the leaky boat of

00:06:06.399,00:06:12.872
the 21st century country called
America. And this is typical of
what people said to me along the

00:06:12.872,00:06:19.312
way. I was at NSA for x years
and I'm incredibly proud of my
contribution. I grew up under

00:06:19.312,00:06:23.383
the tutelage of the best and
brightest I had the privilege of
knowing. I don't believe the

00:06:23.383,00:06:26.620
people or the agency are perfect
but they're the most
intelligent, dedicated, and

00:06:26.620,00:06:31.291
humble group of people you'll
likely ever meet and whether or
not you agree with them, that's

00:06:31.291,00:06:37.230
how many people feel about what
they discovered. Someone at CIA
said to me I didn't spend a lot

00:06:37.230,00:06:41.768
of time on the pointy end of the
stick, but I provided support to
a lot of them and I tried to

00:06:41.768,00:06:47.440
learn and listen and I'm very
proud of my service at CIA, and
the people I worked with, they

00:06:47.440,00:06:52.812
were good, intelligent,
reasonable, circumspect
professionals. And I believe all

00:06:52.812,00:06:57.817
of that is true, but, uh- this
also is true. That the deeper
truth said clearly, will set you

00:07:01.955,00:07:06.960
free. So this topic is a deeply
serious issue, seldom explored
out loud, certainly not out loud

00:07:09.462,00:07:15.635
out here, where we airbrush away
our complicity in what we have
created and what we all sustain

00:07:15.635,00:07:20.640
and are all complicit in
sustaining. The nature of the
work in and of itself can lead

00:07:20.640,00:07:27.213
to situations and conditions
that cause significant trauma or
tie people into ethical knots,

00:07:27.213,00:07:32.252
or frayed the bonds of trust,
which are the substance and
essence of a meaningful

00:07:32.252,00:07:38.391
relationship with other human
beings. Or lead to substance
abuse and divorce in higher

00:07:38.391,00:07:43.396
numbers and the population
experiences and to suicide. That
is not melodramatic. I will give

00:07:45.532,00:07:50.537
you some of the issues in
detail. This is what someone
said to me, who worked at CIA

00:07:53.173,00:07:58.678
for some time, and was extremely
effective. "What you're
describing" they said, "sounds

00:07:58.678,00:08:05.151
oh so familiar." The trauma can
last a long, long time. Those of
us who were counter terror

00:08:05.151,00:08:10.156
before 911, and we were a
ridiculously small number, had
no time to grieve or otherwise

00:08:12.325,00:08:19.232
deal with it at the time.
Consequently, years later we are
still dealing with it. A

00:08:19.232,00:08:24.838
psychiatrist I saw after 911
spoke of fighter pilots
syndrome. One is fine and

00:08:24.838,00:08:29.676
appears to be coping well while
the tension is still on, but
once it lets up, your brain

00:08:29.676,00:08:35.281
chemistry goes crazy. When Bin
Laden was killed, they said I
watched TV coverage of the party

00:08:35.281,00:08:40.787
outside the Whitehouse for an
hour, and I sobbed for the
entire hour. Not because I

00:08:40.787,00:08:47.494
regretted his death, which I did
not, but because of everything
that came before it. And this is

00:08:47.494,00:08:53.066
the key part. It takes so long
to train a good counter terror
analysis- analyst. Yet manager

00:08:53.066,00:08:58.805
are careless in burning out
their people too quickly and
somehow we have to find a way to

00:08:58.805,00:09:03.743
make it viable as a long term
job. That applies, I am told
over and over again, to

00:09:06.112,00:09:12.786
corporate, corporations, burning
out their people in the same
way, as well as the intelligence

00:09:12.786,00:09:18.925
agencies and the security
industry, in many of its
particulars. So we do have to

00:09:18.925,00:09:24.664
attend if we're vigilant to the
consequences of this work. And
we have to care for ourselves

00:09:24.664,00:09:30.570
and for others as if we matter
and as if they matter, and to do
that is a long distance run, not

00:09:30.570,00:09:37.477
a sprint. It not an easy or
quick fix. And this subject is
huge and multifaceted. Any

00:09:37.477,00:09:42.315
segment of this speech could be
in another- another entire
speech. But I want to hit the

00:09:42.315,00:09:47.687
highlights, and if any of you
want to discuss this further, or
talk about the issues, I invite

00:09:47.687,00:09:53.526
you into conversation both in
person, and online. Cards will
be available if you'd like to do

00:09:53.526,00:09:59.566
that. But first let me say how
the intelligence crossover leads
into the infos- info-sec

00:09:59.566,00:10:05.672
business. Because some people
say I don't work for CIA. Some
will say I don't work for NSA.

00:10:05.672,00:10:11.377
Some of you who work for CIA
will say I don't work for CIA.
Some of you who work for NSA

00:10:11.377,00:10:16.382
will say I work for DoD. Um- et
cetera. But the crossover is
significant. They might look

00:10:21.120,00:10:26.125
different but keep n mind our
special forces are currently in
170 countries. They are the oil

00:10:28.194,00:10:34.300
in the machinery of our empire.
And info-sec and intelligence
may not be that different, once

00:10:34.300,00:10:39.873
one is assimilated into the
work, and accepts contracts in
for example, false flag

00:10:39.873,00:10:44.878
operations. We do not know who
we really work for much of the
time. Or when we do, we don't

00:10:47.714,00:10:51.451
know what agreements they made
with intel. I'm sure not
everyone who worked at Cisco

00:10:51.451,00:10:56.489
knew that back doors were being
willfully installed n so much of
the hardware. Or the- the big

00:10:56.489,00:11:01.761
software manufacturers were
doing the same for the software
that they were shipping. Or that

00:11:01.761,00:11:07.166
crypto was being shortened
significantly in key length by
those who lied about what they

00:11:07.166,00:11:11.638
were doing. We all work for the
man one way or another if we're
engaged in this economy and are

00:11:11.638,00:11:17.343
trying to sustain what I call an
empire, but it is. It's a global
structure of transnational

00:11:17.343,00:11:23.249
interaction. I'm sure I'm not
the only one- I'm sure I should
say it this way. I'm sure there

00:11:23.249,00:11:28.454
are some in this room who have
received paychecks with names on
them that are not the ones

00:11:28.454,00:11:35.028
really paying the bill. It's not
all that uncommon. So let me
start with a quote about that,

00:11:35.028,00:11:41.801
and I've sanitized all quotes to
protect both the innocent and
the guilty. It occurs to me, one

00:11:41.801,00:11:45.672
road, how severely the
trajectory of my own career has
taken me from an idealistic

00:11:45.672,00:11:50.677
anarchist, to a corporate
stooge, to an ambitious
entrepreneur, to military

00:11:50.677,00:11:56.249
intelligence defense advisor.
It's dramatic and surprising
when I think about it. This is

00:11:56.249,00:12:01.287
clearly a direction many take,
and the national security state
itself has become the water in

00:12:01.287,00:12:06.659
which we all swim. So that
context is implicitly the life
of everyone else. So one

00:12:06.659,00:12:11.397
intelligence officer would
probably have started out in LA
or intelligence or defense, all

00:12:11.397,00:12:16.069
of which are domains with a
certain expectation of an
extreme lifestyle. Many cyber

00:12:16.069,00:12:20.206
guys started out somewhere
completely different than that.
And then they somehow found

00:12:20.206,00:12:24.877
themselves in the center of the
military industrial complex in
ways they would never had

00:12:24.877,00:12:31.417
prepared for. So, the subject
may be less common in security
or cyber, but it is potentially

00:12:31.417,00:12:36.889
more extreme in its impacts
because the physiological makeup
and life story of a cyber guy

00:12:36.889,00:12:41.894
will not have prepared him, or a
girl, her, woman, her, for it,
They're talking about their own

00:12:44.564,00:12:50.069
life. Another said when one
joins an intelligence service at
the start of a career, you do

00:12:50.069,00:12:55.975
low level apprentice like tasks.
In the course of your career,
actions, decisions slowly grow

00:12:55.975,00:13:01.014
into being almost imperceptibly
for many and you suddenly one
day awake to where you are

00:13:01.014,00:13:05.818
realize that he or she has not
been prepared for this. And
realize too that one is now

00:13:05.818,00:13:11.157
deeply into the situation and
well beyond the point where one
would have- would have stepped

00:13:11.157,00:13:16.162
into it, if it was presented as
it was from the start. If this
is the case, it is too late to

00:13:18.398,00:13:24.103
turn back. So that same waking
up moment applies to
technologies that you work at

00:13:24.103,00:13:29.342
and develop. Whether they're
weapons or genetic mods or total
surveillance. There's always

00:13:29.342,00:13:35.114
attention. A friend at NSA said
because we can do something,
should we? It's true of many

00:13:35.114,00:13:40.987
technologies that once you start
you can't go back. And he added,
some of us are smart enough, or

00:13:40.987,00:13:45.992
not enough to be scared shitless
of the possibilities and trends
that we see. Now I want to just

00:13:48.628,00:13:53.433
say, that when someone tells you
they're scared shitless, they're
saying something serious and

00:13:53.433,00:13:59.172
suggesting a potentially
traumatic impact. More on that
in a minute. One said to me,

00:13:59.172,00:14:03.643
this is an info-sec professional
purely, I would literally go to
sleep some nights wondering if

00:14:03.643,00:14:07.914
tonight is the night I'm
awakened by a page that said I'm
owned. I would pray it would be

00:14:07.914,00:14:12.385
a zero day that is out of my
control. What if it was
something I've fat-fingered,

00:14:12.385,00:14:18.324
maybe I'm not smart enough to do
this job, so I pushed myself
more and more. To attack, all

00:14:18.324,00:14:22.662
you need is access to the
internet. And according to the
security community the attacker

00:14:22.662,00:14:28.401
always wins. So to defend you
just need to run a ship tight
enough to keep out the internet,

00:14:28.401,00:14:33.239
therefore it is a game you are
set up to lose and if you have
any integrity at all, this will

00:14:33.239,00:14:38.244
drive you bonkers. So the
tensions between having
integrity and staving off the

00:14:41.214,00:14:48.187
insecurities of the work that
can drive you nuts. So whether
it's info-sec or intelligence,

00:14:48.187,00:14:52.992
you can play this game but you
can't win. Not if winning is
defined as remaining free from

00:14:52.992,00:14:58.498
the stresses that can have
serious consequences. And one of
my theses is that the national

00:14:58.498,00:15:02.969
security state permeates all of
society and I'll just give lip
service to that. Because I don't

00:15:02.969,00:15:07.273
have enough time to cover
everything I want to cover. A
historical example way back in

00:15:07.273,00:15:12.178
the 1960s a young man named Gene
Groves was thrilled to be
engaged with the US National

00:15:12.178,00:15:16.883
Student Association, worked with
student groups in other
countries. And then Ramparts

00:15:16.883,00:15:22.388
wrote an article uncovering the
fact that the association is and
had been a CIA proprietary,

00:15:22.388,00:15:28.227
funded and sustained covertly by
the agency. That revelation in
the 60s along with revelation of

00:15:28.227,00:15:33.232
many other proprietaries the CIA
ran in the 50s and 60s was a
crisis for the agency because it

00:15:35.802,00:15:41.841
had run free rain in the 50s and
60s, but also for American
innocence. This young guy Groves

00:15:41.841,00:15:47.480
seemed to be set for a great
political career. But his work
for the agency was unwitting,

00:15:47.480,00:15:53.352
that is manipulative and covert.
And he didn't know how he was
being used in the great game.

00:15:53.352,00:15:58.724
And so he was used without being
read into the script, and so
when he found out what was up he

00:15:58.724,00:16:05.464
retreated into private life and
he said pointedly, "This world
has lost innocence for me. I

00:16:05.464,00:16:10.469
want to get out. It's Chinatown,
Jake. It's Chinatown." If you
pay attention and engage with

00:16:13.773,00:16:18.578
the best intentions in your work
over the years you will hear the
whisper of that colleague. "It's

00:16:18.578,00:16:23.583
Chinatown, Jake. Go on home,
it's Chinatown." Which means
this is about trust. Undermining

00:16:27.086,00:16:32.425
trust in others but above all in
the fabric of your own life.
They called ontology, the

00:16:32.425,00:16:36.896
structure of being in
epistemology, the structure of
knowing. And what this can do is

00:16:36.896,00:16:42.835
underline- undermine your belief
that you know who you are, and
the role you are playing in your

00:16:42.835,00:16:47.840
work and in the world. And that
you know what's real. That's the
key thing. It undermines your

00:16:50.042,00:16:55.915
understanding of what is real.
I've had people tell me- tell me
things in this journey that

00:16:55.915,00:17:00.653
pulled the foundation out from
under what I thought as a smart
guy I had put together as a

00:17:00.653,00:17:05.258
physical model of reality and I
found out once again that I was
in the hall of mirrors and I

00:17:05.258,00:17:09.629
didn't know what I didn't know
and when I found out what I
didn't know in a way that pulled

00:17:09.629,00:17:16.602
out that cornerstone of the
whole edifice. It left me with
profound anxiety and a serious

00:17:16.602,00:17:21.807
case of secondary trauma because
I didn't know how to handle not
know what I thought I knew about

00:17:21.807,00:17:26.812
reality itself. And about the
role I was playing in this great
game. So, the betrayal of trust,

00:17:30.616,00:17:34.654
this undermining of what we
believe to be true of the world
and our role in it is one main

00:17:34.654,00:17:39.725
theme. A friend of mine at NSA
said he discovered that a
program in which he participated

00:17:39.725,00:17:45.965
wholeheartedly in the 1980s,
only recently did he and his
cohorts discover that the entire

00:17:45.965,00:17:52.071
purpose of that program was not
what they all believed it to be.
But it was a covert cover story

00:17:52.071,00:17:57.109
for an ulterior purpose to which
the program was merely a support
module and they didn't know it

00:17:57.109,00:18:02.782
for several decades. That
undermined his understanding at
the agency of what it was he

00:18:02.782,00:18:09.055
himself was doing. He told me of
someone who came to work not
long ago at NSA, who when they

00:18:09.055,00:18:14.060
walked into work, discovered for
the very first time, that their
parents worked at the agency.

00:18:17.563,00:18:22.902
Now, what does that do to your
sense of trust in a family if
you find out that the

00:18:22.902,00:18:29.709
foundational story of your
family system has been uh- at
best, a sin of ommission, but

00:18:29.709,00:18:36.382
possibly uh- a lie. Now, inside
it's not a lie. You remember
when Clapper was before

00:18:36.382,00:18:42.455
Congress, and he told them I
said the least untruthful thing
I could say. You know that

00:18:42.455,00:18:47.693
inside the agency work, inside
intelligence work, you are not
lying. You are sustaining cover

00:18:47.693,00:18:53.099
stories which are essential for
the well being blah blah blah.
And you are socialized and

00:18:53.099,00:18:59.038
acculturated to believing that
when you lie you are not lying.
Because you are lying on behalf

00:18:59.038,00:19:05.745
of a bigger truth, which is the
purpose of the agency itself.
And the question becomes is the

00:19:05.745,00:19:11.550
agency a god worthy of worship.
When you're through the looking
glass, once through, can you

00:19:11.550,00:19:17.056
come back. Here's what another
friend said, it's kind of a
funny story. I was always in

00:19:17.056,00:19:21.827
trouble with my wife because the
other wives knew more than she
did. And I was the navigator and

00:19:21.827,00:19:26.665
Ops officer. My daughter, when
she was in Airforce intelligence
officer school, was out with my

00:19:26.665,00:19:31.237
wife and friends. News brought
up North Korea. She had to stop
herself before she got into

00:19:31.237,00:19:36.208
classified material. My wife
pulled her aside and said, but
you can tell daddy about it when

00:19:36.208,00:19:40.980
you get home, because he has a
TS clearance. And the little
girl said, no I can't he doesn't

00:19:40.980,00:19:45.985
have the need to know. And his
response was, "I smiled with
pride." when I heard that story.

00:19:50.623,00:19:56.796
Because she was learning to be
read into missions in a way that
made it fun and clever and cute

00:19:56.796,00:20:00.966
to lie to her own family
including her own father who had
TS clearance about what it was

00:20:00.966,00:20:05.971
she did. Pride and the inability
to tell the truth at home. So,
I'm illuminating the shaky bases

00:20:09.575,00:20:14.113
for what we might think are
essential transactions of a
functional society. And the

00:20:14.113,00:20:19.118
juicy stuff has yet to come. Uh-
I'd like to quote Nietzsche, I'm
just gonna invite Nietzsche into

00:20:21.721,00:20:24.957
the conversation, I'm not gonna
quote him because I don't have
time but the bottom line is he

00:20:24.957,00:20:29.962
said those things you ought to
believe are true are those which
alleviate cognitive dissonance

00:20:29.962,00:20:34.967
by giving you a story which
feels better, feels better. And,
therefore truths that we agree

00:20:37.269,00:20:42.808
are truths in orthodoxy are
really illusions we've forgotten
are illusions. They're metaphors

00:20:42.808,00:20:49.381
that become worn out and drained
of their force. They're coins
which have lost their moxy. In

00:20:49.381,00:20:54.687
other words, undermining trust
leads to a crazy making
experience and when we try to

00:20:54.687,00:20:59.091
build a coherent view of the
novel of the world, it makes us
nuts, we find ourselves inside

00:20:59.091,00:21:04.563
the Philip K Dick novel. Trust
is you know, wrote one is the
coin of the realm in all human

00:21:04.563,00:21:09.034
interactions, observe people
being quite withdrawn, when
trying to socialize with others

00:21:09.034,00:21:14.039
outside the group in the know.
It's all superficial. Good
friends, if a person even has

00:21:14.039,00:21:18.878
any, are only within the group,
or with people who have been in
the group. Often it's attributed

00:21:18.878,00:21:22.314
to a lack of social skills on
the part of a stereotypical
engineer, but that's a

00:21:22.314,00:21:27.987
convenient, socially acceptable
answer so they don't push back.
The isolation of the individual

00:21:27.987,00:21:33.792
in the context we're due to
compartmentalization, clearances
need to know operation tempo,

00:21:33.792,00:21:39.798
office politics. It's difficult
to consult with a trusted and
partial manner, appear to align

00:21:39.798,00:21:45.738
your compass, or get a second
opinion. Whether for operational
issues or moral issues. So the

00:21:45.738,00:21:50.943
individual is left to struggle
in isolation with who to
believe, what to believe, what

00:21:50.943,00:21:56.015
one's bottom line values might
be, which can be different than
what expected when one faces a

00:21:56.015,00:22:01.420
real crisis of conscience. And
what price is one willing to pay
for staying true to whatever one

00:22:01.420,00:22:06.659
clings to in such times. All in
a context where a savvy
individual knows he or she may

00:22:06.659,00:22:10.829
not know the critical pieces of
information, which would change
the picture and their decision

00:22:10.829,00:22:16.635
entirely. In other words, it's-
it's crazy making. There are
other symptoms of crazy making,

00:22:16.635,00:22:21.974
one of which is that you need to
be debriefed all the time.
Listening to folks who have been

00:22:21.974,00:22:26.745
through traumatic events, one
said, you get so wrapped up in
their story, that you need

00:22:26.745,00:22:32.384
debriefing and our standard
practice is to debrief the
debriefers. Now, NATO, we have a

00:22:32.384,00:22:35.921
group that does nothing but
study Russian propaganda.
They're very very good at

00:22:35.921,00:22:40.125
flooding and saturating the
Baltic states and the
Scandinavian states and nearby

00:22:40.125,00:22:46.265
areas with propaganda through
multipurpose attacks. uh- subtle
and covert. And so we have a

00:22:46.265,00:22:49.735
group that studies that
propaganda, but what they
discovered was that even though

00:22:49.735,00:22:52.972
that group knew what it was
doing, was reading the
propaganda for the sake of

00:22:52.972,00:22:58.344
analyzing the propaganda and
responding to it, they never the
less began to believe it.

00:22:58.344,00:23:03.949
Because the part of the brain
that believes takes in without
critical thought, that which is

00:23:03.949,00:23:08.721
presented as true, even though
it is reading it critically with
the prefrontal cortex, and

00:23:08.721,00:23:13.626
trying to understand what's
going on. In other words,
debriefing debriefers means we

00:23:13.626,00:23:20.065
have to setup redundantly,
communities of redemption, to
help people get back on a saner

00:23:20.065,00:23:25.070
track, when they're caught in
the crazy making dynamic.
Project Azorian reminds me that,

00:23:27.306,00:23:33.646
you remember Soviets lost a sub
in the Pacific, uh- in the 70s.
And we created- CIA created a

00:23:33.646,00:23:40.552
proprietary uh- The Hughes
Company to create a a reck- a
boat. Uh- it was under cover.

00:23:40.552,00:23:42.554
The cover story was that it was
looking for manganese nodules.
Interesting thing about cover

00:23:42.554,00:23:47.559
stories is that when they're
layered properly they're all
true. It's just that each one is

00:23:50.029,00:23:54.566
truer than the next. So we were
looking for manganese nodules,
and that was a useful thing to

00:23:54.566,00:23:58.937
do but that wasn't really what
we were doing. We were trying to
get that sub up. And when it

00:23:58.937,00:24:05.344
came up, half of it fell back,
we are told. Uh- and they got
some credible information from

00:24:05.344,00:24:10.749
the rest. But not all of it. I
talked to a man who was in a
lead position in that endeavor

00:24:10.749,00:24:16.255
and he had to leave the issue
uh- shortly before they brought
the sub up. Just a matter of

00:24:16.255,00:24:21.393
weeks, and he'd asked a friend
who'd been part of it, "So what
did you discover" he said "I'm

00:24:21.393,00:24:26.332
sorry, you're no longer read
into the project." Sorry- Uh-
"And therefore you no longer

00:24:26.332,00:24:31.337
have a need to know. You know
that this is put together with
tape? [Laughter] It's a kludge.

00:24:35.674,00:24:42.014
uh- Most ineffectively thought
through. So that's why it is
falling off. So I'll have to

00:24:42.014,00:24:47.586
deal with that. Um- so he
couldn't be told until the rest
of us were told what the real

00:24:47.586,00:24:53.759
story of that was. But the
problem is, we don't know that
that was the real story yet. We

00:24:53.759,00:24:59.264
know we were told, now we can
tell you the whole story, but we
don't know if the was true. Uh-

00:24:59.264,00:25:03.068
the work I did on the uh- Gulf
of Tonkin incident made
perfectly clear how the CIA and

00:25:03.068,00:25:09.608
NSA were at odds about that. And
I talked to the go to radar guy,
who the President Johnson said

00:25:09.608,00:25:13.278
we need to know if we were
attacked by the North
Vietnamese, and the guy said we

00:25:13.278,00:25:19.184
need the radar logs, we need
this, we need that. Uh- and
it'll take me about 48 hours.

00:25:19.184,00:25:23.322
And uh- the director of CIA told
that to Johnson, Johnson said I
need to know in the morning. He

00:25:23.322,00:25:26.992
said we can't tell you in the
morning. The science cannot be
done. The forensics cannot be

00:25:26.992,00:25:31.096
done in the morning. And he went
back and told his colleague that
and he said I can't do it in

00:25:31.096,00:25:36.902
less than 48 hours. And the next
morning Johnson declared war on
the North Vietnamese. And uh-

00:25:36.902,00:25:41.907
thousands, over a million lives
began to be uh- slaughtered in
that machine. The guy at CIA

00:25:44.410,00:25:49.014
went back to the director and
said why won't he let us do our
work, which is intelligence. And

00:25:49.014,00:25:54.453
the answer that came back to him
was because he didn't want to
know the answer. He wanted to go

00:25:54.453,00:25:59.458
to war. So. I ask the historian
at the NSA, the lead guy, what
can you and I discuss with

00:26:01.827,00:26:07.533
confidence in the narrative we
are sharing, that, we're talking
about the same historical

00:26:07.533,00:26:14.006
reality. And he said anything up
until 1945 because that's when
the national security state got

00:26:14.006,00:26:20.779
its wheels. He was kidding, but
he wasn't kidding. So this
permeates the psychosphere of

00:26:20.779,00:26:26.518
the 21st century in our society.
Take the metaphor into the
info-sec world. You often see

00:26:26.518,00:26:31.023
attribution that clearly makes
no sense. What's important
though, is not that it makes

00:26:31.023,00:26:34.726
sense but that you have
attribution, and by attributing
an incident to something, it

00:26:34.726,00:26:39.665
allows you to close the loop
like Nietzsche said, with
comfort and move forward. It

00:26:39.665,00:26:45.370
looks like a cool and fun
environment. But a lot of us, he
said, aren't cut out to deal

00:26:45.370,00:26:49.842
with the trials and
tribulations. The longer you
spend time, he said, the more

00:26:49.842,00:26:54.713
jaded or apathetic or depressed
you become. And in this hyper
world I'm describing are

00:26:54.713,00:26:59.685
relationships and methods of
communication with others
fundamentally change. How is it

00:26:59.685,00:27:04.289
that we come to speak to each
other in a hyper real world
permeated by this sense of

00:27:04.289,00:27:09.895
paranoia. More and more and
more, people will only speak to
me about these issues, in

00:27:09.895,00:27:15.234
person, in crowds walking in
circles. I had someone when I
was going to do a speech in

00:27:15.234,00:27:19.538
Amsterdam say I want to meet
you. When I got of plane, I took
the train to the central

00:27:19.538,00:27:24.877
station, Schiphol to uh-
downtown Amsterdam Central
Station. He met me at the train

00:27:24.877,00:27:28.947
and rode with me to Rotterdam
where I was speaking for
GovCert. And we talked a little

00:27:28.947,00:27:32.150
on the train and then we got off
the train and walked in circles
in a crowd, and then he got back

00:27:32.150,00:27:36.421
on the train and went back to
Amsterdam where he lived. That's
pretty extreme, isn't it, when

00:27:36.421,00:27:41.927
you think about human behavior
which is meant to be spoken face
to face, person to person. This

00:27:41.927,00:27:48.901
is happening, in my experience,
more and more because the
paranoia permeates a society

00:27:48.901,00:27:52.804
with so much intrusion and
surveillance, not because of
what it is doing, but because

00:27:52.804,00:27:57.809
what we're afraid it's doing. Or
what we think it might be doing.
Steve Miles wrote a book called

00:28:02.281,00:28:08.654
Oath Betrayed. When he used
documents the ACLU had gotten
about our torture in Iraq, to

00:28:08.654,00:28:15.027
discover that US medical
officers, Doctors were moving
from torture to torture. By

00:28:15.027,00:28:20.332
torture, I don't mean
waterboarding. Uh- i mean
torture. The people I talked to

00:28:20.332,00:28:25.203
who did this work spoke of 'oops
deaths'. You're working on
someone and suddenly you go

00:28:25.203,00:28:31.910
oops! Lost it. And the doctors
falsify the death certificate
making is sound like natural

00:28:31.910,00:28:37.215
causes and the doctor moves on
to the next interrogation. Which
Steve Miles thought violated the

00:28:37.215,00:28:43.021
Nuremberg provision we ourselves
wrote about using humans to
experiment in ways that build on

00:28:43.021,00:28:47.793
one another. I tried to
introduced the lead bioethicist
at the AMA, American Medical

00:28:47.793,00:28:53.131
Association, in doing something
about this in response to Miles
uncovering this story. And he

00:28:53.131,00:28:59.237
said, we don't touch that. But
this is what happened to Steve.
After a day of reading endless

00:28:59.237,00:29:04.343
descriptions of arbitrary
brutality, I dreamed I was in
Abu Grade. I woke up sweating,

00:29:04.343,00:29:09.448
my heart pounding. Later I had
so much sadness and I just
stopped working on it out of a

00:29:09.448,00:29:15.087
sense of utility. He discovered,
as I've discovered at a certain
point in my career, that we're

00:29:15.087,00:29:21.193
victims of secondary trauma.
Trauma caused by being ancillary
to the act, but absorbing the

00:29:21.193,00:29:27.733
act in an imaginative way. And
his friends took- he was advised
to spend time with your family.

00:29:27.733,00:29:34.006
Spend time with friends. Do
gardening, listen to music. He
also told me, personally just

00:29:34.006,00:29:38.410
last week, he said when I come
back from disaster areas, I
decompress on the way out in a

00:29:38.410,00:29:43.815
non-affected part of the country
so I can see that, some parts of
the world are lovely still.

00:29:43.815,00:29:49.321
After horrendous times in
Indonesia, Bosnia, Angola, I was
restored only by participating

00:29:49.321,00:29:54.292
in the everyday rhythms of life.
Going to coffee shops, having a
beer at sunset, for several days

00:29:54.292,00:29:59.297
until I could function once
again. Another told me, I had to
separate my life; my work life

00:30:02.167,00:30:07.406
and my personal life. I
increased my commute time. I was
intentional about starting and

00:30:07.406,00:30:12.711
stopping activities that were
challenging emotionally. There's
some of this work about living

00:30:12.711,00:30:17.215
and working in the zone, how
much personal do you let in? And
how much do you have to remain

00:30:17.215,00:30:22.220
in a robotic and automatic mode
of acting? I came, she said,
grateful that I did, from a

00:30:24.756,00:30:28.894
public health wellness
background so I could deal with
what was happening to me. But

00:30:28.894,00:30:35.534
most of my colleagues are not
trained in how to do that. And
that's my point. Most of us, in

00:30:35.534,00:30:41.406
this work, are not trained, in
what I call the human dimension
of technology. When I offered

00:30:41.406,00:30:48.080
this talk to Blackhat it was
turned down because I was told
it was fluff. If the human

00:30:48.080,00:30:53.085
dimension of our lives, in work,
in very essence of our being is
fluff, than fluff am I. Because

00:30:55.654,00:31:00.592
I think these are [applause]
thank you. [applause] I think
these are the critical issues

00:31:03.995,00:31:10.569
which as we age in the- the fun
of the great game wears off, and
the buzz of working on the

00:31:10.569,00:31:15.040
edges, and on the dark side, and
the light side, and the gray
side, all at the same time. As

00:31:15.040,00:31:20.278
that wears off, well, I got a
call one night from somebody at
one of the agencies, and we

00:31:20.278,00:31:23.148
spend an hour, and I had to tell
him at the end of it, what I
used to say when I was in

00:31:23.148,00:31:28.153
ministry. This conversation did
not happen. It only will be rev-
recalled if you bring it up. I

00:31:31.089,00:31:35.227
can not bring it up, I have to
treat it as if I didn't hear
everything you said in this

00:31:35.227,00:31:41.433
hour. And then he got off the
phone with some sense of what he
had to do to resolve the

00:31:41.433,00:31:46.838
terrible conflict he was up
against between his work and his
conscience. And I was left with

00:31:46.838,00:31:52.944
it. This is why I know about
secondary trauma, first hand.
Paranoia sets in, and it leads

00:31:52.944,00:31:58.850
to a constant sense of danger. A
CIA worker said, paranoia,
you're always looking, is

00:31:58.850,00:32:03.255
someone following you? They
watching with you? How many of
you sit with your back to the

00:32:03.255,00:32:08.794
wall in a restaurant? How many
of you are habitually scanning
the crowd for anomalies so you

00:32:08.794,00:32:13.098
have an escape route planned in
advanced so you can take action.
I did that whenever I was on the

00:32:13.098,00:32:18.103
ground in Israel. We had better
learn to do that on the ground
in this country as well. But, I

00:32:20.739,00:32:25.744
begin every encounter, one said,
in a state of distrust, all my
life. I have a standard line

00:32:28.346,00:32:33.685
that bore people away from the
topic of what I do, so they
won't ever ask incriminating

00:32:33.685,00:32:40.158
questions. An NSA colleague
said- friend, I'm paid to think
of as many possibilities as I

00:32:40.158,00:32:45.497
can, to be sneakier than the
sneakiest bastards in the world,
because they'll throw everything

00:32:45.497,00:32:51.169
at the things I'll design. I
have to be professionally
paranoid, trust is difficult.

00:32:51.169,00:32:55.440
Especially for those of us who
have to be distrustful because
the job, and on top of that, he

00:32:55.440,00:33:00.378
added, we get screwed over by
our bosses on coworkers as well.
So, a ranking senior person at

00:33:02.814,00:33:07.819
NSA said, yeah, I personally
might be paranoid, but they are
out to get us. And we have to

00:33:11.156,00:33:15.994
act as if they are. So one
added, is there anybody in the
rest of the world who sees me

00:33:15.994,00:33:22.067
personally as a target, and if
so, is it just business, or is
it personal. And what about all

00:33:22.067,00:33:26.771
these great moralistic leaks,
from people whose names you know
because of their righteous

00:33:26.771,00:33:33.612
posture on the high moral
ground. People were named, whose
lives are now at stake. The

00:33:33.612,00:33:37.115
government keeps things so
segmented, you think you're
working on one project, but it's

00:33:37.115,00:33:42.287
part of something bigger and
when Snowden outed you, it means
the bad guys can learn who you

00:33:42.287,00:33:47.325
are, and they won't just come
after you, one told me. They'll
come after your whole family. I

00:33:47.325,00:33:51.096
was told that was the difference
between the Mafia and the
Russian Mafia- The Italian

00:33:51.096,00:33:57.502
Mafia. The Italian Mafia will
kill you. The Russian Mafia will
kill you and your whole family.

00:33:57.502,00:34:04.376
It's great to know these
distinctions, isn't it? But we
do go after families. A guy who

00:34:04.376,00:34:08.980
work for many years through the
CIA recruiting agents told me I
never put pressure on the agent

00:34:08.980,00:34:13.652
I'm trying to recruit. What I do
is find out where his kids are
and I try to put pressure on the

00:34:13.652,00:34:18.189
kids. I find out where he works
and I put pressure on him at
work. I find out about his wife

00:34:18.189,00:34:23.962
and I put pressure on her
covertly. And then as all those
pressure sources build around

00:34:23.962,00:34:28.967
me, and like wagons circling
slower, uh- smaller and smaller.
His crisis and anxiety- sense of

00:34:31.202,00:34:38.043
crisis and anxiety builds, and
he falls into my arms, he comes
to us. It's the nature of the

00:34:38.043,00:34:44.516
work. The nature of the work.
And when you have to let those
people go, because you're

00:34:44.516,00:34:49.521
protecting friendlies, it causes
many sleepless nights. Friended-
well one of the agencies

00:34:54.326,00:35:00.298
discovered that someone he had
recruited was discovered, and
tortured, and killed. And he

00:35:00.298,00:35:04.202
felt personally responsible for
it, and he started drinking
heavily, so he was stripped of

00:35:04.202,00:35:08.206
his clearance, he was relieved
of his major responsibilities,
and he was put into therapy to

00:35:08.206,00:35:13.611
try to get him back and thy said
to the guy discussing this, so
is your goal to have im- have

00:35:13.611,00:35:17.782
greater integrity, authenticity
and freedom to function as a
human being, and he laughed. He

00:35:17.782,00:35:24.189
said no, our goal is to have
hime do the job. And if he can't
do the job the way we want, then

00:35:24.189,00:35:29.694
we watch hime very very very
carefully. And sometimes what's
done to you makes it difficult

00:35:29.694,00:35:34.866
to do the job. I know someone
who came to the agency late and
because of that was alway

00:35:34.866,00:35:40.205
suspect because he hadn't been
born and bred for the work. And
so when there were significant

00:35:40.205,00:35:44.909
leaks going on, he was suspected
at once and his clearances were
stripped and he was interrogated

00:35:44.909,00:35:50.415
seriously um- and heavily. Not
tortured, but interrogated for
over a year, until it was

00:35:50.415,00:35:54.285
discovered that someone else had
in fact, been the source of the
leaks, and so what did the

00:35:54.285,00:35:59.290
agency do? They fired him,
because after what they had done
to him for a year, they could no

00:36:01.493,00:36:08.400
longer trust him, not to work in
good faith, because of the
resentment and anger he might

00:36:08.400,00:36:14.672
feel as a resort of- result of
his maltreatment. And he
couldn't say to the outer world,

00:36:14.672,00:36:19.244
anything but can you help me
find another job, I have kids in
college and I'm in my 50s,

00:36:19.244,00:36:24.049
because he had signed the
agreements that keep you
handcuffed, and your mouth

00:36:24.049,00:36:30.922
closed. Other things that get to
people are like, prolonged
exposure to pornography,

00:36:30.922,00:36:35.927
especially child pornography. At
AFOSI, um- DOJ, I've talked to
people who finally had to get

00:36:39.697,00:36:44.736
away from the work because they
looked at so much pedophile
material. So living in fear,

00:36:44.736,00:36:49.741
hyper vigilant under constant
threats, that creates trauma.
High stress said one, hell yes.

00:36:55.246,00:37:01.419
So, one said to me, how about
being in a really- reality
extensively where you're

00:37:01.419,00:37:05.390
expecting to have your throat
slit, get a knife in your back,
and it's a normal day or night.

00:37:05.390,00:37:10.428
Actually the days weren't bad,
the night is when it got scary.
Or another, hacking into a

00:37:10.428,00:37:15.667
government's computers, I knew,
that if my presence was
discovered, the system

00:37:15.667,00:37:20.572
administrator there would be
tortured and executed for a
failure to perform his duties

00:37:20.572,00:37:25.376
and I would bear the burden of
that. Another said, what do you
think it's like to hear your

00:37:25.376,00:37:30.949
coworkers dying as they are
bombed, while manning listening
posts and communication areas

00:37:30.949,00:37:35.954
under manhole covers in foreign
countries. No wonder it's not
spoken of out loud, or out here.

00:37:39.624,00:37:46.531
Um- I was just given a time
thing. Um- as result of
conversations I've had with

00:37:46.531,00:37:52.604
people, I have much more
material than I can use, so I'm
going to again, try to move

00:37:52.604,00:37:57.609
ahead and hit the high points.
Uh- this trauma can lead to
tears. I held in my arms as he

00:37:59.944,00:38:06.451
sobbed, a ranking person from
NSA, who was bereft because 11
people died on a mission he had

00:38:06.451,00:38:10.655
supported with his intelligence
work. And what he kept saying
is, I tried to do everything I

00:38:10.655,00:38:15.527
could, did I do enough. Did I do
enough, did I do enough. And
because I had been in the

00:38:15.527,00:38:21.566
clergy, I could pronounce words
without him- without potency of
absolution and forgiveness. So

00:38:21.566,00:38:25.203
when I wrote to him about the
torture I was discovering we
were doing, and asked his

00:38:25.203,00:38:30.275
opinion, he said unless you have
done it, then the least of thee
my brethren, you have done it on

00:38:30.275,00:38:35.280
to me. It has consequences. I
killed people he said. I tried.
Is that enough? So it leads to

00:38:41.753,00:38:46.090
ethical dilemmas when you're
forced to make choices that can
violate the course of action

00:38:46.090,00:38:51.095
you're encouraged to take on
behalf of the work. In those
agencies, a strong conscience

00:38:51.095,00:38:58.102
can be more dangerous than a
mole. Because you are not as
predictable and you may act

00:38:58.102,00:39:03.741
according to your conscience.
You may be not considered a team
player. And as several have told

00:39:03.741,00:39:07.478
me, you are not included in
political and casual
conversations anymore, only

00:39:07.478,00:39:12.483
technical, because you are no
longer trusted to be quote, one
of us. The real moral burden for

00:39:15.420,00:39:19.524
many, said Robert Steel after
years at the CIA, has been
complicit in crimes against

00:39:19.524,00:39:24.762
humanities, the price for
keeping our job. Thomas Drake
told me I was very publicly

00:39:24.762,00:39:29.100
indicted under the espionage
act. I was declared indigent by
the court, I faced decades in

00:39:29.100,00:39:34.672
prison. My life was turned
upside down and inside out and
I've already lived a very

00:39:34.672,00:39:39.677
dystopian, and Orwellian future.
Oh, there were heartbreaks said
a CIA friend. When we couldn't

00:39:42.347,00:39:46.751
warn a friendly about something
bad likely to happen, if it
would jeopardize our sources and

00:39:46.751,00:39:52.290
methods, and our assets and
their safety. We talked about
these things many times. We

00:39:52.290,00:39:58.096
never took them lightly. But
still, it can be hard to sleep
at night, when you don't tell

00:39:58.096,00:40:02.900
people what's going to happen,
and others die as a result. Who
pays the price for this? The

00:40:02.900,00:40:09.674
people doing them. But can we
stop doing these missions in the
world in which we inhabit? No.

00:40:09.674,00:40:14.579
But we can take care of the
people we put into these
positions. We can take care of

00:40:14.579,00:40:20.852
them differently. In drone work,
you know, the US Air Force is
fighting similar cognitive

00:40:20.852,00:40:25.456
dissonance to what I'm
describing. Uh- in crews, they
get up at a normal family

00:40:25.456,00:40:30.261
routine, go to work, go into
war, come home again. They walk
in the office, they're at war.

00:40:30.261,00:40:34.732
They walk out, and go home, and
they're walking into an entirely
different world. This one used

00:40:34.732,00:40:40.571
the metaphor scuba diving. When
you come up, you need to
decompress. They risk physical

00:40:40.571,00:40:45.076
damage and even death if they
come up too fast. The Air Force
is working on approaches to

00:40:45.076,00:40:50.081
decompress the drone crews, and
others who do work like it. It
carries over to info-sec. I

00:40:52.283,00:40:57.188
remember a guy finding in light
of a major breach, they found
him sobbing at his desk. Because

00:40:57.188,00:41:02.160
he thought he would lose his job
and he had so much at stake. A
friend said he had confronted

00:41:02.160,00:41:07.165
the face of evil. We lighten the
taxonomy of hacking, serious
dark side hacking, by making

00:41:10.802,00:41:15.373
something other than what it is.
Those who encounter it in a way
that destroys their lives or

00:41:15.373,00:41:22.280
careers, are looking at the face
of evil. And what else does it
do? Trauma creates numbing, and

00:41:22.280,00:41:26.584
numbing means a lack of
relationships, and that means
divorce. I talked to a guy in

00:41:26.584,00:41:32.490
another country. I said, how
does your work affect you, he
said two divorces. My dad said

00:41:32.490,00:41:36.527
another- announced the family
when I was 38, he'd been a
special agent since before he

00:41:36.527,00:41:41.099
met and married my mom. He
changed his identification, none
of us knew who he were, the

00:41:41.099,00:41:45.737
secrets were buried with him. I
came to visit mom, she met me at
the door, she said she's filing

00:41:45.737,00:41:50.742
for divorce, because she could
never again trust dad. The
dehumanization of others leads

00:41:53.144,00:41:58.149
to the dehumanization of self.
There's and normal- enormous
personal and professional price

00:42:00.651,00:42:06.190
that we are paying. I was- I
witnessed a super secret
executive decisions after 911,

00:42:06.190,00:42:10.428
that I knew had enormous
strategic consequences, said
this guy at CIA. I stared into

00:42:10.428,00:42:15.266
pandora's box and and he had
just stared back. But I had
exercised my moral agency and

00:42:15.266,00:42:19.504
became a truth teller and a
whistleblower, refusing to break
faith or fidelity with oath I

00:42:19.504,00:42:24.509
took to defend the constitution,
at an enormous price. What is
that, 5 minutes? No, 5, yeah.

00:42:34.585,00:42:38.556
[Laughter] [Applause] When I was
a high performance case officer,
said Robert Steel after 9 years-

00:42:38.556,00:42:43.995
good years at the CIA, I had 5
times the regional average in
recruitment. I was very

00:42:43.995,00:42:48.332
productive. And I observed the
personnel management working
group and the director of

00:42:48.332,00:42:53.271
operations DO. I noted they were
seemingly proud of having the
highest rates of alcoholism,

00:42:53.271,00:42:58.276
adultery, divorce and suicide in
the government. I personally now
think of this, have 23

00:42:58.276,00:43:03.414
professional suicides in my
mental log book. The first was
in instructor who blew his

00:43:03.414,00:43:07.919
brains out when I was in
training. The latest was senior
figures who could not live with

00:43:07.919,00:43:14.692
what they knew. So, the
conditions are created, the
impact happens, the consequences

00:43:14.692,00:43:21.199
take place. And then what? Are
you treated inside where you can
only go to a therapist who has

00:43:21.199,00:43:26.637
been cleared to hear you. I said
this- this sort of thing at a
talk Source Boston a few months

00:43:26.637,00:43:31.976
ago, and a former head of IAD at
NSA was in the audience, and she
said, I've never had these

00:43:31.976,00:43:36.314
issues, people came to me all
the time with their problems,
and I said you go wherever you

00:43:36.314,00:43:41.219
want, and I said and could they
discuss the work issues? She's
well of course not. And I said

00:43:41.219,00:43:46.324
but it's the work issues that
are the problem and the source
of their distress, and she

00:43:46.324,00:43:51.529
looked off in the distance as if
she had never given that a
thought before. Michael Hayden,

00:43:51.529,00:43:55.666
when he was at the CIA, started
working on marriages because he
said quote, he suspected there

00:43:55.666,00:44:00.671
was a high rate of divorce. We
can't get the figures out of
them about what kind of divorce

00:44:00.671,00:44:05.676
there is. But, you need to have
third party mediation in those
situations and in ethical

00:44:07.778,00:44:12.884
issues. You can't leave an
ethical issue in the hands of a
person who has a stake, money on

00:44:12.884,00:44:17.722
the table of that game. Because
then they'll make a decision on
behalf of the system, and not of

00:44:17.722,00:44:23.294
behalf of the well being of the
inst- the person. So, to work
with an individual at a crisis

00:44:23.294,00:44:28.299
in conscience would be, said one
at NSA, alleviate there pain and
get them back to work. Watch

00:44:28.299,00:44:32.370
them carefully if we suspect
them. So is it laughable, I
said, to think a psychiatrist

00:44:32.370,00:44:37.008
inside can work with someone
having a crisis of conscience?
And he said it is indeed

00:44:37.008,00:44:43.047
laughable. It is indeed
laughable. Stansfield Turner at
CIA said, huge problem with

00:44:43.047,00:44:48.019
alcoholism, I think, everybody
kinda knows this if they know
anything about it and choose to

00:44:48.019,00:44:53.257
look. But he rejected an article
on the subject, because he said
to my friend, the writer, quote,

00:44:53.257,00:44:59.997
it's a problem, but we don't
want to talk about it. Well,
what I'm trying to make a

00:44:59.997,00:45:05.036
decision to do is talk about it
after 20 years of listening to
this. There are consequences to

00:45:05.036,00:45:10.241
what we do and what we choose to
do and there's strategies we can
devise, that help us sustain

00:45:10.241,00:45:15.246
ourselves. But we find ourselves
at these various crossroads. You
need friends, and what I've said

00:45:17.748,00:45:22.320
is that often people tell me
they can't because the deception
and deceit have real friends

00:45:22.320,00:45:27.091
because they can't disclose the
truth of who they are, or fear
what their coworkers or families

00:45:27.091,00:45:31.696
or friends would think if they
disclosed who they were. But
without close friends, without

00:45:31.696,00:45:36.400
people, even in the agency, and
people are encouraged, at CIA,
to marry other agents at the

00:45:36.400,00:45:42.673
CIA, cause no one else will
understand what's happening. You
need family and friends and do

00:45:42.673,00:45:48.279
gardening and music and yoga and
meditation. I don't want to get
religious on you- whoop ass on

00:45:48.279,00:45:52.650
you but, the fact is that
meditation and the spiritual
tools that have been discovered

00:45:52.650,00:45:56.420
for thousands of years help,
they let you become more fully
present and conscious to

00:45:56.420,00:46:00.324
yourself which is a primary
antidote, according to Van der
Kolk, a major source of

00:46:00.324,00:46:05.296
expertise on trauma. An antidote
to what trauma does to your body
and where it goes and what it

00:46:05.296,00:46:10.301
does to you. You can become
fully present to yourself once
again, both feel your body and

00:46:10.301,00:46:15.039
feel your mind and be present
mentally and emotionally and
spiritually to yourself, and

00:46:15.039,00:46:21.212
then you can make decisions in
full force and conscience. You
can write about it. A friend

00:46:21.212,00:46:25.950
Susan Hasler wrote a novel
called Intelligence that just
rages with white heat. She is so

00:46:25.950,00:46:29.820
angry at the agency. It's the
only way she can talk about it.
She couldn't talk about it out

00:46:29.820,00:46:34.825
here. You can come here, and
find, if you can, the people you
need, as I have for 21 years. Or

00:46:37.294,00:46:42.466
existence here is paradoxical
said one. And we try to frame it
as either professional life or

00:46:42.466,00:46:48.039
an online persona, or hacker
handle or family mode. But
DefCon is unique, he included.

00:46:48.039,00:46:54.111
This place is where all our
lives of paradoxes collide into
one gigantic fireball of intense

00:46:54.111,00:46:59.116
existence. And let's face it, we
are hooked on that reality. You
wouldn't be in the game, if you

00:47:02.286,00:47:07.224
didn't love the game. But all
I'm saying is you need to be
mindful and vigilant of what the

00:47:07.224,00:47:14.231
game can do, and find strategies
and alternatives to letting you-
letting it eat you up. Because

00:47:14.231,00:47:19.403
the places for which you work,
whether government or corporate,
have one goal in mind.

00:47:19.403,00:47:26.077
Newspaper, The Onion, my best
source of news today, once said,
uh- quoting a customer service

00:47:26.077,00:47:31.449
representative, our customers
are our second most important
focus. By which they meant of

00:47:31.449,00:47:36.454
course, the money and power were
the first. And that's the way
the systems work. So, I'm going

00:47:38.756,00:47:44.095
to conclude by saying, uh- well
I have to say always, buy my
book. It's irrelevant to this

00:47:44.095,00:47:50.301
talk, but buy my book. Uh-
[laughter] You've got to get
that in somewhere, and it's

00:47:50.301,00:47:55.139
anomalous but, there it is. I'll
be doing a signing tomorrow of
UFOs in government. And I have a

00:47:55.139,00:47:58.809
whole section in here that I
didn't touch, and what it does
to people to have a genuine UFO

00:47:58.809,00:48:02.880
encounter. And what it does to
traumatize them because they
can't speak about it to anybody

00:48:02.880,00:48:09.687
else, without being though crazy
or insane. And the other book is
FOAM, a novel. And I began

00:48:09.687,00:48:13.691
writing fiction again when a
friend at NSA said you can't
talk about this stuff unless you

00:48:13.691,00:48:18.028
write fiction. It's the only way
you can tell the truth. So I'm
free to my last several

00:48:18.028,00:48:22.933
speeches. One is on the UFO
book, one is on, Fiction is the
only way to tell the truth. And

00:48:22.933,00:48:27.238
tomorrow at noon, up at the
DefCon suite, I'll be signing or
talking about books and just

00:48:27.238,00:48:31.876
hanging out. And above all, come
up and get a card if you want
it. I'm always available, ping

00:48:31.876,00:48:35.746
me if you want to talk, ping me
if you want to email. Ping me if
you want to walk in a circle in

00:48:35.746,00:48:40.518
a crowd in a foreign city where
no one knows your name, except
the people who are watching you.

00:48:40.518,00:48:45.523
Uh- I belong to this community.
I genuinely belong to it. 21
years is not an accident.

00:48:50.594,00:48:56.467
Especially at the pay rate,
right? You come because you love
it, and because you derive so

00:48:56.467,00:49:02.573
much more value than you've ever
deriven. So, my stake in the
game is to be committed to

00:49:02.573,00:49:07.244
letting what I once called in a
different profession, the power
of love speak, the truth, it

00:49:07.244,00:49:12.449
sets people free. And if anybody
wants to have those
conversations, or find a way to

00:49:12.449,00:49:17.755
be directed to where those
conversations can happen, just
ask me about it. And thank you

00:49:17.755,00:49:22.760
so much for your attentiveness.
[Applause]
