00:00:01.201-->00:00:06.039
>>Hi and welcome to the internet
of vibrating things, I'm
"goldfisk" >>And I'm "follower",

00:00:06.039-->00:00:12.713
and we're much more exciting
than Mr Robot. >>Aah,yeah, so
please set your phones to

00:00:12.713-->00:00:17.718
vibrate and we'll begin.
[applause] >>Er, so, er before
we get started we, er, just

00:00:21.588-->00:00:26.593
wanted to er, cover some, er,
content advisory. Uhm, our goal
with this talk is to, er, create

00:00:30.130-->00:00:36.069
an inclusive and, er, safe
environment for us and you to
learn more about, er, sex and

00:00:36.069-->00:00:41.141
technology and how they
interact. Uhm, there are no
sexually explicit, er,

00:00:41.141-->00:00:47.915
descriptions or images in this
talk, er, and although we do
mention, er, some legal aspects.

00:00:47.915-->00:00:53.153
And our focus is on the
technology aspect, and, er, when
you're talking to people after

00:00:53.153-->00:00:58.558
the talk, er, please ensure, if
you are talking about things not
related to technology, that you

00:00:58.558-->00:01:02.763
have their consent and that
they're comfortable having that
conversation with you first.

00:01:02.763-->00:01:07.034
>>Alright so, bluetooth. Uhm,
it's in your phone, it's in your
smart watch, your fitbit, your

00:01:07.034-->00:01:13.874
doorbell, your door lock, your,
uhm, mouse, your keyboard...it's
everywhere. Is this on? >>yip,

00:01:13.874-->00:01:19.846
yeah. I'd just stand there.
>>Uhm, so bluetooth devices are
everywhere: they're in your

00:01:19.846-->00:01:26.520
fitbit your phone, your laptop,
your the lock on your door, your
doorbell. They're everywhere and

00:01:26.520-->00:01:30.123
a lot of people aren't really
aware of the security around
this. So it makes sense that

00:01:30.123-->00:01:33.961
adult toys are going to have
that technology too. Uh,
generally bluetooth, internet

00:01:33.961-->00:01:39.399
connected devices are vibrators
'cause it's sort of the techy
part, uhm, and increasingly

00:01:39.399-->00:01:43.003
they're becoming associated with
mobile apps as well, so there's
the internet connection through

00:01:43.003-->00:01:49.843
there. >>What could possibly go
wrong with that? >>Sec-urity,
more like like sex-urity, am I

00:01:49.843-->00:01:54.915
right? It's just a laugh, right?
It's just like sex toys, like
you know, who actually uses

00:01:54.915-->00:01:59.920
those anyway? >>So, er, a lot of
people had that attitude, er,
and one of the things we wanted

00:02:01.955-->00:02:06.860
to cover is what's actually at
stake. Uhm, because it's all
very well and good and well to

00:02:06.860-->00:02:10.630
make jokes about it, but as one,
er, manufacturer talks about,
they have over two million

00:02:10.630-->00:02:16.503
people using their devices. So,
what's at stake is two million
people, er, and, er, and that

00:02:16.503-->00:02:21.308
starts to become about: hey,
this is about people, it's not
just a joke. >>Uhm, and that's

00:02:21.308-->00:02:26.313
just one of the manufacturers
Right, so the immediate thing
is: What if you could... taken

00:02:28.648-->00:02:32.586
to someone's device and control
their toy? You turn it on, you
make it do whatever you want.

00:02:32.586-->00:02:37.657
That's sort of the immediate
thing that comes to mind. >>And,
er, a lot of, er, people in the

00:02:37.657-->00:02:41.695
past have sort of said: hey,
this isn't really a serious
issue ...a vibrator, it's just

00:02:41.695-->00:02:46.800
for fun. Uhm, but if you come to
back to the fact that we are
dealing with people here, then

00:02:46.800-->00:02:53.340
er, in fact, er, unlawful, er
control of a device like a
vibrator actually counts, er,

00:02:53.340-->00:02:59.112
potentially, as sexual assault,
because it's unwanted sexual
content. >>Uhm, there's not

00:02:59.112-->00:03:02.649
really much legal precedent for
this kind of thing. cause in
terms of remote controlling

00:03:02.649-->00:03:08.622
devices, uhm, so this definitely
an interesting area. >>So
there's a spectrum of, of what

00:03:08.622-->00:03:13.827
we call interim intimate
devices, er, if you have someone
who can control your lightbulb

00:03:13.827-->00:03:18.532
it's annoying, er, but it's not
something that particularly
intimate to you. But once you

00:03:18.532-->00:03:23.203
start moving into devices like
vibrators, or at the far end,
something that's, er, connected

00:03:23.203-->00:03:28.175
to your life like a heart - like
a heart pacemaker, er, then you
start to get a bigger picture of

00:03:28.175-->00:03:35.082
why the issue of, er, security
in these areas is, er,
particularly important. >>Uhm,

00:03:35.082-->00:03:38.785
so then moving on from the
control. What happens if people
can find out things about you

00:03:38.785-->00:03:42.722
using this? So, the very basic
level: what happens if people
can find out that you in

00:03:42.722-->00:03:47.828
possession of this device? Uhm,
particularly, in certain places
it's illegal to own a sex toy,

00:03:47.828-->00:03:52.833
uhm, and it is a criminal
charge. Uhm, and in some
places... there is a legal

00:03:54.868-->00:03:59.873
precedent of the possession of
sex toys causing a legal charge.
Uhm, yeah. >>And it's, er, not

00:04:04.177-->00:04:09.182
just overseas either. Uhm, in
er, in the US, uhm,, Alabama is
one state that's banned sex

00:04:11.618-->00:04:16.623
toys. There's a town in Georgia
that does as well. Uhm, the
situation in Texas is a little

00:04:16.623-->00:04:22.329
confused. Up and till very
recently uhm, there was a ban in
place. Uhm things we've seen has

00:04:22.329-->00:04:27.234
said it was declared
unconstitutional, so doesn't
apply, but it still appears in

00:04:27.234-->00:04:33.273
the, uh, code when we went to
look at. >>Alright and then
getting even into an even wider

00:04:33.273-->00:04:39.379
sense: what sort of information
can a device like this generate
about you? Uhm, so, there's all

00:04:39.379-->00:04:43.617
kinds of different data. There's
your, uhm, temperature, your
session information, there could

00:04:43.617-->00:04:47.320
be other potential senses. We
just looked at one product in
particular, but a whole lot of

00:04:47.320-->00:04:51.958
other senses generating all this
personal information about you
and a lot of apps have audio and

00:04:51.958-->00:04:58.632
video chat associated with that.
>> So when we started out, uh,
with this research, we were

00:04:58.632-->00:05:04.337
wondering: oh what are the
potential exploits or
vulnerabilities that a, a, third

00:05:04.337-->00:05:09.242
party hacker could take
advantage of? But then we looked
more closely, it actually turns

00:05:09.242-->00:05:14.281
out you might be more concerned
about what the manufacturer's
doing, and what they're doing

00:05:14.281-->00:05:19.286
with your data. So, this is the
Standard Innovation Corporation
and they're the manufacturer of

00:05:22.656-->00:05:29.396
the We- Vibe device that we
looked at. And so: do you want
these people looking at your,

00:05:29.396-->00:05:36.102
er, looking at your own, er.
temperature data potentially,
or, er, real time data as you

00:05:36.102-->00:05:42.709
use the device about what
patterns you like or what, uhm,
intensity you like? >>And what

00:05:42.709-->00:05:47.747
are, what are the implications
of who they're gonna to give
that data to. Uhm, I mean, these

00:05:47.747-->00:05:52.986
companies say that they, they
claim that they are very
concern-they keep that secure

00:05:52.986-->00:05:59.292
and secure about their privacy,
uhm but if we look in their
policy, we can say, see that

00:05:59.292-->00:06:02.729
they say that "we reserve the
right to disclose your
personally identifiable," that's

00:06:02.729-->00:06:08.168
your name with your
information,"if required to bide
the law". Uhm, and there's a bit

00:06:08.168-->00:06:13.039
of, not much clarity about what
if nots required by the law, but
they have other reasons to, so

00:06:13.039-->00:06:18.311
that's a little bit dodgy. >>And
so one of the things is that
people can make the argument:

00:06:18.311-->00:06:23.183
well, you know, usage data
collection is just the standard
part of mobile apps these days.

00:06:23.183-->00:06:29.556
And we wanna question that
assumption and say: you know if
you are making devices that are,

00:06:29.556-->00:06:34.194
uhm, controlled by mobile apps
that of a more intimate nature,
maybe you should consider

00:06:34.194-->00:06:38.064
whether you should be collecting
that information in the first
place. Because if the

00:06:38.064-->00:06:42.736
information isn't collected,
then it's not vulnerable to
either security releases or

00:06:42.736-->00:06:49.175
legal enforcement, uh, of
releasive data. >> Uhm, so this
is the specific product that we

00:06:49.175-->00:06:54.180
looked into and had the hardware
for. It's wearable so you can
wear it under your clothes. It

00:06:56.549-->00:07:02.022
can be controlled either with a
remote or with...
[unintelligible] and has two

00:07:02.022-->00:07:06.826
mirrors and so it's bluetooth
connected to your phone or the
remote. >>And what do you know?

00:07:06.826-->00:07:12.265
It turns out this device does
send information back to the
manufacturer. Uhm, so the

00:07:12.265-->00:07:18.004
temperature data comes from, as
we understand it, a thermostat
inside the device itself seems

00:07:18.004-->00:07:24.911
to be related to monitoring the
temperature of the motor but we
also determined it's affected

00:07:24.911-->00:07:30.417
by, uhm, like contact with the
human body. So, at a minimum you
can determine, er, if probably

00:07:30.417-->00:07:34.854
whether or not a device is in
use even if it's not actually
active. Uhm, so this is sent

00:07:34.854-->00:07:41.561
once per minute and the modem
tends to read data, er, which is
the pattern you're in and how

00:07:41.561-->00:07:47.100
strong it is, is a real time
event. And so the manufacturers
currently are collecting real

00:07:47.100-->00:07:54.007
time data on how, er, all their
customers are using their
devices. >>Uhm, so if you're

00:07:54.007-->00:07:57.977
using this specific device, what
are the things you can you do to
avoid this? You can use it as a

00:07:57.977-->00:08:01.815
"dumb vibe", it has one control
button on it. You can use a
remote control which isn't

00:08:01.815-->00:08:06.319
sending data, you can use the
app if you're not connected to
the internet in any way. Uhm,

00:08:06.319-->00:08:11.658
even if you're, if you're
communicating using that device
with a partner over the internet

00:08:11.658-->00:08:15.261
it's automatically sending data.
But even if you are not doing
that, if you are connected to

00:08:15.261-->00:08:20.266
the internet, it is sending
data. Or you can block access
using a firewall. Uhm, or you

00:08:22.268-->00:08:26.673
can use this tool we've made,
using web bluetooth. We've made
the Weevil Connect which has

00:08:26.673-->00:08:33.012
basic functionality to use the
Vibe directly from your phone
browser on your phone. >>And so

00:08:33.012-->00:08:38.418
you can either use a hosted
version of Weevil Connect or you
can,ah, also run it locally. And

00:08:38.418-->00:08:43.390
all web bluetooth connections
have to be over an SSL
connection. Er, and so, we can't

00:08:43.390-->00:08:49.462
promise you that we aren't doing
something nefarious, but you can
at least check out the code and

00:08:49.462-->00:08:54.234
see. But this is, er, that's
approaching the solution
technological end. Uhm, we're

00:08:54.234-->00:09:00.807
also wanting to approach it
from, er, the wider, er,
societal end as well, er, and so

00:09:00.807-->00:09:05.045
in light of that, we're
announcing the private player
chord. And so the goal with the

00:09:05.045-->00:09:09.682
private player chord, is pro-
protect the privacy of people
who are using devices like

00:09:09.682-->00:09:14.521
these. Er, we wanna promote
transparency from the
manufacturers about the data

00:09:14.521-->00:09:18.958
that they can co-collect so that
people can make informed buying
choices. And that the

00:09:18.958-->00:09:23.863
manufacturers that do treat,
uhm, the privacy and security o
of people intimate data

00:09:23.863-->00:09:30.537
seriously, people can choose to,
er, to, to make those, er,
purchase choices with that

00:09:30.537-->00:09:36.709
knowledge. >>Er, er, so at the
moment, we've just recently
contacted manufacturers and we

00:09:36.709-->00:09:40.180
have, er, some, er, questions
asked there, and we gonna have
that on the website that we

00:09:40.180-->00:09:43.983
going to host for that. >>And,
er, along with that, we've come
up with a draft rating system

00:09:43.983-->00:09:50.957
for particular products, uhm
where, you can get at-a-glance
view of, of, er, their approach,

00:09:50.957-->00:09:55.962
whether they click data or not,
whether it's often or not. And
you can help by using some of

00:09:58.064-->00:10:02.836
the tools and techniques we are
gonna to use later by
investigating other devices and,

00:10:02.836-->00:10:08.741
uhm, reporting your findings on
that data that they find. >>Er,
okay, so that's the

00:10:08.741-->00:10:12.579
implications. Now how did we get
there? What did we do to reverse
engineer this? So, there's,

00:10:12.579-->00:10:16.583
er...these are some of the
things we did, tools we used -
that you can use too, and of

00:10:16.583-->00:10:22.655
course the to- the Weevil tools
that we made. >>Er, Goldfisk,
what about the people sitting in

00:10:22.655-->00:10:26.726
the audience who say "I don't
know anything about reverse
engineering, I could never do

00:10:26.726-->00:10:30.897
this."? >>Well, that's fine
because I didn't know nothing
about reverse engineering. Uhm,

00:10:30.897-->00:10:34.767
there's a lot of, basically
there's just a lot of playing
with things, looking around

00:10:34.767-->00:10:39.939
seeing what you can find. A lot
of things we just stumbled on to
by accident. >>So, yeah,

00:10:39.939-->00:10:45.111
curiosity is definitely, er,
your most useful, ah, tool when
it comes to reverse engineering.

00:10:45.111-->00:10:51.217
So we generally start with one -
with three questions: er: What
does the device do? How does it

00:10:51.217-->00:10:56.990
do it? And then: How can we
control it once we know that
information? >>Uhm, so again

00:10:56.990-->00:11:00.894
this is the We-Vibe 4 plus. We
had the hardware for this, but
you don't actually need the

00:11:00.894-->00:11:04.464
hardware of a device to do
internet of things reverse
engineering. You can whole lot

00:11:04.464-->00:11:10.403
from what's already on the
internet. Er, so this is the
We-Connect, this is their mobile

00:11:10.403-->00:11:15.408
app that comes with it, that you
can control your device from.
>>So, when your, er, connected

00:11:17.744-->00:11:23.583
with a, er, partner, there's the
bluetooth link between the vibe
and your phone. Er,

00:11:23.583-->00:11:29.756
interestingly enough, there's
not, er, a lot of reliability, a
lot of reliability in, uhm,

00:11:29.756-->00:11:34.127
bluetooth LE connections in
these devices because it turns
out humans make excellent Farady

00:11:34.127-->00:11:39.132
cages. So you have connections
from the phone going to the, er,
server, to the manufacturer and

00:11:44.137-->00:11:50.677
then back out to the phone of
your partner. And the finding
the statistics of the API

00:11:50.677-->00:11:56.549
information which was what's
reporting back the temperature
and other information, we found

00:11:56.549-->00:12:01.487
using an MIT enproxy tool which
performs, enables you to have a
man-in-the-middle view between

00:12:03.957-->00:12:08.962
the app and the, er, back-end
server. Er, now if you're
familiar with Pokemon-Go, er,

00:12:11.030-->00:12:15.668
they had the same issue that
this manufacturer has, which
they didn't implement

00:12:15.668-->00:12:19.305
"certificate pending" and if
they had, that would have made
it, er, more difficult to

00:12:19.305-->00:12:24.310
impersonate the back-end server.
>>Alright, so, first approach we
can take is: hardware. >>The,

00:12:27.714-->00:12:32.719
er, any device that's sold in
the US that, er, transmits, er,
radio frequency, er, is required

00:12:34.988-->00:12:41.160
to be registered with the FCC to
be sold and other jurisdictions
other, uhm, certification boards

00:12:41.160-->00:12:45.898
are there. And part of the
process is: you have to submit a
bunch of documents describing

00:12:45.898-->00:12:51.638
how your device works. And, it
includes, er, internal
photographs which sometimes are

00:12:51.638-->00:12:56.643
really terrible and sometimes
actually quite useful. >>So, the
one on the, the one on the right

00:12:56.643-->00:13:01.214
is the board from inside of the
Vibe and the one on the left is
from inside the remote. >>And

00:13:01.214-->00:13:05.551
so, from looking at this, we
discovered that they use Texas
instrument chip. And it's a

00:13:05.551-->00:13:11.157
really old architecture: 8 -0-51
which is often used in really
cheap, er, control situations,

00:13:11.157-->00:13:16.929
and have bluetooth stack
associated with that. Uhm, the,
er, compiler that you need to

00:13:16.929-->00:13:21.934
use is a mere $3000, er,
although there is some, er,
effort with FCC to support the

00:13:24.337-->00:13:29.642
bluetooth stack, er, and the,
er, chip. Er, there is some
evidence that there is potential

00:13:29.642-->00:13:35.081
over the air firmware updates,
because there's strings in the
app about it, but there was no

00:13:35.081-->00:13:38.951
functionaliy that we identified
in the app that we could perform
over the air updates at this

00:13:38.951-->00:13:43.956
stage. Of course, the FCC
doesn't, er, show and share
every document they receive to

00:13:46.292-->00:13:51.664
the public. It's possible for a
manufacturer to say: "Hey, we'd
like you to keep this, er,

00:13:51.664-->00:13:56.669
confidential." Uhm, but
sometimes the FCC makes mistakes
and er, so we discovered that in

00:13:59.472-->00:14:04.744
a later model, er, the
certification, the request to
keep this document confidential,

00:14:04.744-->00:14:09.449
somehow slipped through. So, if
you're looking for advice,
definitely check out the FCC's

00:14:09.449-->00:14:15.188
site for the documents you're
supposed to have and sometimes
you might get a bonus too. Oh,

00:14:15.188-->00:14:18.991
yeah, and don't do drugs,
because if you have a drug
conviction, er, FCC

00:14:18.991-->00:14:23.896
certification is considered a
federal benefit, and so you
can't get a certification.

00:14:23.896-->00:14:28.201
>>Okay what else can you
actually do without having this
device? You can look on the

00:14:28.201-->00:14:30.269
internet. Other people have
taken apart. They are very
expensive devices so you don't

00:14:30.269-->00:14:34.607
have to. This is a Reddit
account associated with another
manufacturer who do really

00:14:34.607-->00:14:39.312
interesting TED hours of adult
toys, uhm you can see the two
motors in the board and the, er,

00:14:39.312-->00:14:45.251
battery in there. Er, and this
is our remote, it was more
disposable, so we took that

00:14:45.251-->00:14:51.057
apart and had look to see
inside. Uh, so we know now from
the chip and specifications that

00:14:51.057-->00:14:54.594
this device is controlled with
bluetooth low energy, or
Bluetooth smart, so how can we

00:14:54.594-->00:14:58.698
communicate with that? Er, the
great thing about bluetooth low
energy is that they've set a

00:14:58.698-->00:15:04.637
standard profile, so we can,
that means, that we can interact
with the device through, in, in

00:15:04.637-->00:15:09.642
standard way, by interacting
with the standard profiles so
that we have each peripheral

00:15:11.844-->00:15:16.349
device with the centralised,
mobile seriest of services, uhm
some are standard like battery

00:15:16.349-->00:15:21.387
level, but some, uhm, specified
by the person making it, and
whether those have

00:15:21.387-->00:15:26.926
characteristics you can use to
read or write back to the
device. Uhm, so we used an app

00:15:26.926-->00:15:31.097
called Nordic Connect. This is
just on our mobile device and
didn't have any extra hardware

00:15:31.097-->00:15:35.501
or anything we can open it up
and connect. This is the We-Vibe
4 plus which for some

00:15:35.501-->00:15:42.341
inexplicable reason is named
Cougar. [inaudible question]
Yes, all of them. Uhm, but none

00:15:42.341-->00:15:47.880
of the other devices. Just the 4
plus for some reason. Uhm, so we
find here at the bottom, some

00:15:47.880-->00:15:51.717
generic differences and then at
the bottom unknown service which
then you can see has two unknown

00:15:51.717-->00:15:56.622
characteristics, uhm we find out
later that one of them is the
control and one of them is the

00:15:56.622-->00:16:02.128
status characteristic. >>Hey,
Goldfisk, we should like, er,
try sending some data to that,

00:16:02.128-->00:16:06.833
er, device now that we know
certain characteristics. But how
will we know what data to send?

00:16:06.833-->00:16:10.503
>>I don't know. That's really
weird, I mean we could just send
random data, but that would take

00:16:10.503-->00:16:15.808
a very long time. So, what we
can do, we can take, er, why
either you can use

00:16:15.808-->00:16:20.813
man-in-the-middle to find out
what that new device is sending.
Or one could use android logs

00:16:20.813-->00:16:25.184
to, uhm, find out what's been
sent over, oh no sorry,
bluetooth sniffing to find out

00:16:25.184-->00:16:29.388
what's sent between either the
remote and the device or your
mobile thing and the device, uhm

00:16:29.388-->00:16:35.194
or there's some android login
functionality set up by sent.
But the approach that we took

00:16:35.194-->00:16:40.233
was: getting an APK format that
android apps are distributed in.
We're just looking at android.

00:16:40.233-->00:16:46.072
Uhm, so you can get and
decompile that and look what's
inside. Uh, so, this is what we

00:16:46.072-->00:16:51.277
found. Sync pulse command has an
integer array that looks
suspiciously like someone could

00:16:51.277-->00:16:56.515
send over bluetooth. And, if we
send it over bluetooth, what
happens is it vibrates three

00:16:56.515-->00:17:00.486
times. So this is awesome
because we know we've
communicated with the device in

00:17:00.486-->00:17:04.290
a functional way we've actually
talked to it and know what we
want. Now we just have to figure

00:17:04.290-->00:17:09.128
out how to do that how can we
do that better? And how can we
do interesting things with that?

00:17:09.128-->00:17:15.401
>>So it turned out that, er, the
data that's transmitted is
always eight bytes long. Uh, and

00:17:15.401-->00:17:19.939
the first byte determines what
the command is and so there's a
variety of different commands,

00:17:19.939-->00:17:25.545
that er, the Vibe obeys. Now
obviously we could stick with
using a generic app, and the

00:17:25.545-->00:17:29.949
Nordic app is pretty cool she
saves values to send back and
stuff like that. But we also

00:17:29.949-->00:17:35.555
wanted to create er, some
software that would run, er, on
[inaudible] dot machine. So we

00:17:35.555-->00:17:40.226
discovered that node has the
best Bluetooth LE's support, I
guess it's the new hotness or

00:17:40.226-->00:17:45.965
something? So, we used a library
called Noble for controlling the
device. >>And, er, there's no

00:17:45.965-->00:17:52.638
library that you can Bluetooth
the device so you can simulate
the device on your, uhm, on your

00:17:52.638-->00:17:57.610
laptop and connect t it with
your mobile device or your- for
the remote it's slightly

00:17:57.610-->00:18:00.646
different, and there's some
things going on there so you'll
connect to it and it thinks it's

00:18:00.646-->00:18:06.252
the device. >>So that meant that
we could, er, have a connection
with the app and then every time

00:18:06.252-->00:18:10.990
you press the button or use some
functionality in the app, it
would send the data to what it

00:18:10.990-->00:18:16.696
thought was a device, and we
could see , er, what the device
was , er, expecting to receive.

00:18:16.696-->00:18:21.133
So, we could then that
ourselves. >>Uhm, so that was
great and we got some great

00:18:21.133-->00:18:24.870
things. We found out how to get
the information like the
temperature, the modes, the

00:18:24.870-->00:18:29.375
intensities but we were like:
How can we make this better? How
can we make this you can have on

00:18:29.375-->00:18:33.613
your mobile device that has a
user friendly interface? Uhm, so
we went with web buetooth. You

00:18:33.613-->00:18:38.684
don't need an app for it, just
uhm, it's in development for
chrome, uhm, we still, we're not

00:18:38.684-->00:18:44.123
quite sure around everything at
the moment. But this is what we
went for as a start for

00:18:44.123-->00:18:47.760
re-implementing the
functionality ourselves, without
needing any of the standard

00:18:47.760-->00:18:54.600
innovations, er, software. >>And
so Weevil Connect is part of a
suite of tools, er, the Weevil

00:18:54.600-->00:19:00.439
suite of tools that which allows
yout to interact with We-Vibe
devices. Uhm, one. There was a

00:19:00.439-->00:19:05.711
really interesting, er, or
useful website, which was a team
play generator for webbed

00:19:05.711-->00:19:10.649
Bluetooth er, software
development. So you can
basically say: this is the

00:19:10.649-->00:19:14.754
service we want to interact
with, this is the characteristic
we wanna interact with and it'll

00:19:14.754-->00:19:19.925
generate, generate a, uhm, a
class that has all the boiler
plate stuff that you can then

00:19:19.925-->00:19:25.965
just say: send this sequence
bytes to this characteristic.
Er, now we learnt some other

00:19:25.965-->00:19:31.771
things along the way which were,
er, the in-invitation. >>We
learnt about invitations, uhm

00:19:31.771-->00:19:38.444
>>They don't expire. >>There's
weird stuff going on that don't
expire, uhm other stuff we

00:19:38.444-->00:19:43.215
release, we were gonna release
it, release this, uhm, for you
to use. Lots of different things

00:19:43.215-->00:19:48.087
in there. Have a look. There's
other cool things, other cool
things going on playchord.com.

00:19:48.087-->00:19:52.558
find us at rancidbacon and g0
ldfisk with a zero and a K. Uh,
yeah, we'll put that all that

00:19:52.558-->00:19:57.563
up. That'll be up in the next
day or so, er, thank you so much
for having us here. [applause]
