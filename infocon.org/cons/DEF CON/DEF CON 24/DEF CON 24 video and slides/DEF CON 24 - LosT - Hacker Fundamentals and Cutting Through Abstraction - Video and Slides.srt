00:00:00.400-->00:00:05.405
>>Good afternoon hello wow
everybody's got their own
conversation going on, cool, I

00:00:08.308-->00:00:13.847
guess you're not really wanting
to pay attention to what the
badge means or any of the good

00:00:13.847-->00:00:20.654
wonderful puzzles and other fun
hijinks that L0st has put into
it but if you do here's Lost

00:00:20.654-->00:00:25.659
[applause] >>How's everybody
doing today? [applause] >>I love
you Lost! >>Thanks, I love you

00:00:34.134-->00:00:40.607
too, I would ask a a little
patience, for those of you who
may have heard rumors in the

00:00:40.607-->00:00:46.947
wind we we we have hiccups with
regarding the badges every year
and this particular hiccup has

00:00:46.947-->00:00:53.320
made me go the past three days
with roughly two to three hours
of sleep total so bare with me I

00:00:53.320-->00:00:57.758
also am gonna do a kind of new
thing during this 101 talk it's
going to be kind of an

00:00:57.758-->00:01:02.162
experiment and it's either going
to go totally off the rails or
it's gonna be fine but that'll

00:01:02.162-->00:01:07.301
be based on you guys and me so
we're gonna try and go through
this together. I do this 101

00:01:07.301-->00:01:11.638
talk every year um for those of
you who don't know because it's
101 this is not I'm going to

00:01:11.638-->00:01:15.175
drop 0day I'm not going to talk
about elite stuff and I'm not
going to come and act like I'm

00:01:15.175-->00:01:20.147
this snooty jackass who knows
more than you do um cause like
most of you are way smarter than

00:01:20.147-->00:01:26.219
I am I'm just a weirdo with a
soldering iron and uh and like
math a lot but um how many of

00:01:26.219-->00:01:31.224
you this is your first Defcon by
a show of hands holy crap
[laughter] yeah! Welcome!

00:01:35.495-->00:01:40.634
Welcome! So I I really hate
giving talks like this because I
really prefer having discussions

00:01:40.634-->00:01:46.006
and on that note there is a room
on the conference floor that's
the 1057 room and I request that

00:01:46.006-->00:01:50.510
couches are put in there every
year because I encourage people
to come in and just sit down and

00:01:50.510-->00:01:55.349
hang out and talk with people
because if people at this con
whether they're the person who

00:01:55.349-->00:01:59.486
invented a programming language
or wrote some major app if
they're so pretentious that

00:01:59.486-->00:02:04.925
they're not approachable I don't
want 'em here. So if And if if
you try and approach someone and

00:02:04.925-->00:02:08.929
you try and talk to them and
they're too high and mighty to
talk to you you can tell them to

00:02:08.929-->00:02:13.934
fuck off because I just don't
want them here [applause]. Of
you guys that are here for the

00:02:19.606-->00:02:26.013
first time, how many of you are
from out of the United States?
Wow, thank you thank you for

00:02:26.013-->00:02:32.686
travelling so far to come here.
Okay a couple of things we're
going to do here so for those of

00:02:32.686-->00:02:39.259
you don't know my name is Lost
uh they call me 1057 Lost Boy
couple other things all the

00:02:39.259-->00:02:45.432
crazy crypto puzzly stuff that
you see stuff on the lanyards
stuff in the program that's all

00:02:45.432-->00:02:49.836
me so that's basically a
representation of all of my free
time from the last year

00:02:52.806-->00:02:56.276
[laughter] And I'm often asked
you where you know how do I
structure these things how does

00:02:56.276-->00:03:01.081
it come up with? So I I believe
I do have ADD OCD where I'm
constantly changing what I'm

00:03:01.081-->00:03:06.753
completely obsessed about and um
I I I have these little quirky
things that I do every year like

00:03:06.753-->00:03:12.526
one thing I would recommend that
you guys do is I pick two uh
publications of any kind that

00:03:12.526-->00:03:16.630
are completely out of my
wheelhouse every year and I read
them during that year and over

00:03:16.630-->00:03:19.966
time the the the knowledge base
that I have tends to grow and
the reason I do that is I have a

00:03:19.966-->00:03:21.968
couple of pet peeves and in full
disclosure I use the 101 talk to
try and dispel or stop some of

00:03:21.968-->00:03:23.970
the pet peeve stuff that I have
in the community and I try and
do that by raising us all

00:03:23.970-->00:03:28.975
together so here's a couple pet
peeves that I have for those of
you who've heard this before I

00:03:40.787-->00:03:45.358
apologize but there's a lot of
new people here I mean who here
has been to a talk of mine

00:03:45.358-->00:03:51.598
before? So not very many, okay.
Sorry about how helter skelter
it is like I said I'm running on

00:03:51.598-->00:03:55.569
very little sleep right now in
fact I promise the opening
ceremonies tomorrow will be much

00:03:55.569-->00:04:00.006
more structured we're supposed
to be having fun in here this is
101 and originally it wasn't

00:04:00.006-->00:04:04.077
even an official track part of
Defcon it was just us hanging
out in the highways and some

00:04:04.077-->00:04:09.082
other people put this track
together but anyway one of my
pet peeves is this idea that um

00:04:12.252-->00:04:16.790
as hackers you have to be
creative and in order to be
creative you have to think

00:04:16.790-->00:04:21.228
outside the box and how many of
you have heard the term think
outside the box raise your hand

00:04:21.228-->00:04:25.065
how many of you know what the
origin of that term is where
does that come from? Besides

00:04:25.065-->00:04:31.338
obvious imposed you have a set
of mental heuristics that you're
imposing upon this problem and

00:04:31.338-->00:04:36.743
you carry those with you and if
some high and mighty guy came
down from off the ti- off the

00:04:36.743-->00:04:41.748
mountain top and said thou shalt
not impose this particular
heuristic then all of a sudden

00:04:43.783-->00:04:49.055
magically you're going to be
creative and go ah ha eureka and
you're gonna solve the next you

00:04:49.055-->00:04:53.593
know major problem. So there
have been studies that have
shown that that's total bullshit

00:04:53.593-->00:05:00.033
the uh the original origin of
that uh term is from the nine
dot problem which is a puzzle

00:05:00.033-->00:05:04.171
where you draw nine dots in a
box three three and three and
they say connect all the dots

00:05:04.171-->00:05:06.173
without lifting the pen and of
course or in some times you'll
have the constraint you can't

00:05:06.173-->00:05:09.776
cross the lines some you can
just depends on the variant and
of course invariably people have

00:05:09.776-->00:05:12.345
imposed this mental box because
it's in a square and so it's
really really difficult and then

00:05:12.345-->00:05:14.347
some jackass comes up and is all
clever and is all oh I go
outside what that frame was

00:05:14.347-->00:05:16.349
yadda da yadda da well it's been
studied and it's been shown that
even if you take a group of

00:05:16.349-->00:05:18.952
people and you tell them from
the start you have to draw
outside this imposed square that

00:05:18.952-->00:05:22.722
the same percentages of people
solve the problem or can't solve
the problem and the way you get

00:05:22.722-->00:05:25.659
people to have those epiphanal
ah-ha creative moments is
through deep study in a

00:05:25.659-->00:05:29.696
particular subject area. Now as
we go further and further with
technology Google search engine

00:05:29.696-->00:05:36.469
instant gratification phone in
your pocket I don't have to go
through any of the mental labor

00:05:36.469-->00:05:40.807
to get any of the answers of
questions that I have any more
we we do certain things faster

00:05:40.807-->00:05:42.809
but we've lost a sense of wisdom
in our knowledge and by doing so
we're starting to short change

00:05:42.809-->00:05:46.947
ourselves and we're going to
start to lose the in the
epiphanal genius moments that

00:05:46.947-->00:05:53.653
come from that deep study of the
subject area so when I do my
cryptographic puzzle challenges

00:05:53.653-->00:05:58.658
I structure them to do three
things. I want you guys to talk
to each other, I intentionally

00:06:24.451-->00:06:28.655
put things on the lanyard every
year so that you have to find
other people and you have to

00:06:28.655-->00:06:32.459
interact with them not only that
but there's stuff even on the
back here you have to take it

00:06:32.459-->00:06:37.297
off you have to linger in front
of the other person it forces at
least a a time for you to

00:06:37.297-->00:06:43.136
interact with one of those other
people and for a crowd that is
predominantly introverts you

00:06:43.136-->00:06:49.142
know I'm trying to force you to
talk to each other. You know the
whole joke about you can tell

00:06:49.142-->00:06:53.713
who the who the uh the extrovert
at like the defcon conferences
is the guy looking at someone

00:06:53.713-->00:06:58.718
else's shoes [laughter] but
anyway so that's that's my soap
box for that. During the 101

00:07:02.522-->00:07:07.527
talks I have a tradition also of
saying I'm not going to explain
and obviously in a forty minute

00:07:09.663-->00:07:13.667
talk or fifty minutes I don't
even know how long I'm supposed
to be up here but in a talk I'm

00:07:13.667-->00:07:18.672
not going to be able to teach
you, thank you, or give you, um
deep knowledge in a subject.

00:07:21.007-->00:07:24.744
What I'm hoping to give you are
hooks, I'm hoping to give you
hooks that give you the right

00:07:24.744-->00:07:29.482
points to start to go down and
by the way I mean don't I do not
mean to show disrespect to

00:07:29.482-->00:07:33.586
anybody I know a lot of you have
deep knowledge in a lot of these
subject areas but I kind of

00:07:33.586-->00:07:38.558
shotgun it to try and give
people a foundational knowledge
of these are the things that I

00:07:38.558-->00:07:42.429
think if you kind of generally
know about you can have a well
informed conversation with

00:07:42.429-->00:07:49.002
someone at a place like Defcon,
cool? We we understand where I'm
coming from? Yes, no? You awake?

00:07:49.002-->00:07:55.241
Yeah, I'm tired too. Well what
do you think of the badge this
year, by the way? [applause] So

00:07:55.241-->00:08:00.180
because this is 101 and don't
tell don't tell DT I'm gonna
tell you this because I'm not

00:08:05.018-->00:08:07.420
gonna I I don't know if he'll
say it in opening ceremonies I
don't know if it's a secret or

00:08:07.420-->00:08:11.791
not I'm going to tell you guys
because you're at 101 which
means you're hard core. There

00:08:11.791-->00:08:17.163
are There were let's just say I
can't tell you the quantity but
there were thousands of badges

00:08:17.163-->00:08:21.835
that were ordered, how many of
you have ever done uh my uh
production of electronics of any

00:08:21.835-->00:08:26.973
kind? Okay how many of you
understand how long it takes to
do not only do pick and place

00:08:26.973-->00:08:31.711
but how long it takes to program
firmware onto something? Every
single one of the badges that

00:08:31.711-->00:08:36.716
you have around your neck right
now were programmed within the
space of the last three days.

00:08:38.752-->00:08:43.757
[applause] And that and that's
why I say none of this would
happen without the community

00:08:47.927-->00:08:53.700
because that wasn't me that
wasn't Lost jackass with a
programmer that was hundreds and

00:08:53.700-->00:08:58.805
hundreds of volunteers who
weren't paid who are people that
come to the con that are here

00:08:58.805-->00:09:02.542
early that we run up and down
the halls going we have an
emergency guess what badges

00:09:02.542-->00:09:08.748
showed up and they weren't
programmed before they got to us
and so we set up a chop shop and

00:09:08.748-->00:09:14.954
went to town and and and there
are people there are people in
this room right now who have

00:09:14.954-->00:09:19.959
been awake literally for four
days. Some of them are in the
front row right here [applause]

00:09:25.765-->00:09:30.770
Okay pet peeve number two. I get
really frustrated with people
first of all if you don't

00:09:34.174-->00:09:38.645
understand or know something
admit it. I don't know lots of
stuff. When I talk to people at

00:09:38.645-->00:09:42.749
Defcon there's really really
smart people around here, you
guys. And when I have

00:09:42.749-->00:09:46.319
conversations with you after I
give talks like this people come
up and they want to talk about

00:09:46.319-->00:09:49.923
stuff and they'll say something
it'll be like oh I didn't know
what that is, tell me, explain

00:09:49.923-->00:09:55.795
that to me. Um my grandfather
used to talk about Columbo if he
if him he uh the younger people

00:09:55.795-->00:10:00.800
in the audience are like who the
hell is that, google him. Um so
so Columbo is a fictional

00:10:02.836-->00:10:08.041
character who was like the
excuse me the ultimate social
engineer he used to get everyone

00:10:08.041-->00:10:12.812
he met to teach him something
even if he knew it already
because it disarmed them. So

00:10:12.812-->00:10:17.817
social engineering tip 101 right
there. But I I try and and not
have you know when I first came

00:10:20.119-->00:10:23.823
to Defcon it scared the crap it
was like these guys are way
smart they're gonna say stuff I

00:10:23.823-->00:10:26.793
don't' understand and they're
going to think I'm an idiot and
they're going to kick me out I

00:10:26.793-->00:10:31.831
didn't know what was gonna go
on. And if you can just be
confident enough to talk with

00:10:31.831-->00:10:35.535
people be like hey I don't know
what that is and on the flip
side don't be an arrogant ass

00:10:35.535-->00:10:38.705
but if you know something share
it with other people because
that's the only way this

00:10:38.705-->00:10:42.976
community is gonna get better.
For example how many of you
aware with the discussions that

00:10:42.976-->00:10:48.047
are going on with cryptography
and back dooring? Yes, no? The
politics involved? The what's

00:10:48.047-->00:10:53.286
going on? That's going to
fundamentally change
communication and with people

00:10:53.286-->00:10:57.156
like us and the folks at the
Defcon conference we need to
talk about stuff like that

00:10:57.156-->00:11:01.361
because otherwise stuffs gonna
go and the genie won't be able
to put it back in the bottle

00:11:01.361-->00:11:06.366
after certain events. So I'm not
gonna push my politics on you
but let's just say we need to

00:11:06.366-->00:11:13.172
share the knowledge and
information so that we can all
elevate and it's not select so

00:11:13.172-->00:11:19.479
okay I get really tired when I
talk to people and they make the
statement I know that a computer

00:11:19.479-->00:11:24.484
uses binary I know that a
computer speaks binary oh that
just like it's like uh cheese

00:11:26.920-->00:11:31.424
grater on my thigh I don't know
how else to describe it [laugh]
sorry so and I often will ask

00:11:31.424-->00:11:38.231
people do you know what that
really means and do you
understand that? Now I know

00:11:38.231-->00:11:41.801
there's a lot of people in this
audience who are like all I do
is code I don't give a shit how

00:11:41.801-->00:11:47.240
the processor works, I hate that
attitude how can you think like
that remember the discussion we

00:11:47.240-->00:11:51.411
just had about creative
epiphanal moments a lot of times
those epiphanal moments become

00:11:51.411-->00:11:56.082
from tangential information that
may be related to the subject
but not directly involved

00:11:56.082-->00:11:59.953
because if it was directly
involved some jackass would have
already thought of it. How many

00:11:59.953-->00:12:04.757
of you know about the original
bell labs or heard of it? And if
you haven't especially young

00:12:04.757-->00:12:08.695
folks go look it up because it's
like my dream mecca like if I
could go anywhere in a time

00:12:08.695-->00:12:12.865
machine I would go back in time
to the original bell labs the
reason the original bell labs by

00:12:12.865-->00:12:16.502
the way you have C because of
the original bell labs you have
a lot of things that you use in

00:12:16.502-->00:12:20.740
your daily life because of the
original bell labs what it was
was a collection of experts in

00:12:20.740-->00:12:24.577
different areas but they weren't
stove piped it wasn't like
here's the math department

00:12:24.577-->00:12:28.514
here's the physics department
here are the electronic guys
they were like the chemist was

00:12:28.514-->00:12:32.151
next door to the chemist guy who
was next door to the computer
guy who was next door to the

00:12:32.151-->00:12:34.554
mathematician next door to the
linguist and they all had access
to each other and that's what

00:12:34.554-->00:12:38.758
caused this this genesis of all
of this great creativity and
we've started losing that

00:12:38.758-->00:12:43.830
because everybody wants to keep
everything secret they don't
want to share and and so we lose

00:12:43.830-->00:12:48.801
those epiphanal interconnections
so back to the I know how a
processor works. If you come to

00:12:48.801-->00:12:53.239
me and say uh Ryan you you
wasted my time at Defcon because
I don't care how a processor

00:12:53.239-->00:12:57.910
works I just want to code I
would say to you you do not have
the mindset of a hacker and I

00:12:57.910-->00:13:02.849
don't want to talk to you so
[applause] I mean like I go back
to that comment I said about

00:13:09.389-->00:13:13.426
subscribing to magazines I
subscribed to like a sewing
magazine for a year you know

00:13:13.426-->00:13:18.798
just and I actually learned
really cool stuff so here's one
of the experiments we're gonna

00:13:18.798-->00:13:22.101
do today and you guys are all
coming along with me on this
ride because this one's gonna be

00:13:22.101-->00:13:26.139
fun. So uh can I have a couple
of you or however many you want
I know you all got cell phones

00:13:26.139-->00:13:32.545
in your pockets that have timers
on them like the stopwatch
because I'm not going to lie I

00:13:32.545-->00:13:37.250
did not practice this part
because I was like let's balls
to the wall let's go let's see

00:13:37.250-->00:13:42.388
if we can do this. Pull out your
phone so in a second we're gonna
synchronize and we're gonna

00:13:42.388-->00:13:47.393
start and I'm going to try in
ten minutes to talk through
going from the three basic

00:13:49.896-->00:13:55.802
fundamental logic gates to a
functioning processor in ten
minutes how many of you have had

00:13:55.802-->00:14:00.073
digital logic uh in- uh classes
and things like that? How many
of you could sit down and

00:14:00.073-->00:14:06.879
actually describe that process
to somebody? How many of you
kinda remember? Okay how many of

00:14:06.879-->00:14:11.584
you are students right now?
Everybody should raise their
hand by the way it's a trick

00:14:11.584-->00:14:16.589
question [laughter] okay so are
you ready? 'Cause I need to
drink some water and we're gonna

00:14:19.592-->00:14:23.629
go and the reason I'm only doing
it in ten minutes in that way if
you guys if this is a total

00:14:23.629-->00:14:29.502
failure we only wasted ten
minutes and you can kind of you
can kind of forgive me for that.

00:14:29.502-->00:14:35.074
So what this is not this is not
me teaching you all of this
information this is me running

00:14:35.074-->00:14:39.479
through the forest wildly like
my hair is on fire screaming out
the things that you should

00:14:39.479-->00:14:44.150
google or lookup that you would
then be able to have the
knowledge of what these things

00:14:44.150-->00:14:48.755
are. And if one or two things
sounds interesting to you hook
on to that and go down that path

00:14:48.755-->00:14:53.192
so again 101 talks nobody's
going to be able to give you the
deep dive in a forty minute

00:14:53.192-->00:14:59.966
talk. Are you ready? Okay so at
like three minutes or somebody
somebody be like hold your

00:14:59.966-->00:15:03.269
finger like three don't do it
like I guess you could do it
every minute like one two

00:15:03.269-->00:15:07.940
because I kinda got a feel for
how we have to do this and I
have to talk really fast so here

00:15:07.940-->00:15:12.945
we go How to build a processor
in ten minutes and no pressure
is a total failure alright ready

00:15:19.552-->00:15:25.992
set start your things Okay so we
got this guy his name is George
Boole he's cool he comes up with

00:15:25.992-->00:15:30.463
this type of logic um where he
talks about these three
fundamental logic gates um and

00:15:30.463-->00:15:36.335
or and not how many of you have
heard of that raise your hand
yes we all heard of it okay so

00:15:36.335-->00:15:41.941
if I take a piece of wire okay
and I cut it here and here I
have just created a logic gate

00:15:41.941-->00:15:46.078
it's called and why because if I
connect the wire here but not
here the electricity doesn't

00:15:46.078-->00:15:49.715
flow if I connect it here and
not here electricity doesn't
flow if i have two cuts and I

00:15:49.715-->00:15:54.487
put them both down this and this
electricity flows through it so
I can make an and gate with a

00:15:54.487-->00:16:01.160
wire so we have the first
fundamental logic gate Or I can
take the same wire and I can run

00:16:01.160-->00:16:05.364
it in parallel and I can cut one
or cut the other and if I
connect one of them electricity

00:16:05.364-->00:16:11.504
is still gonna flow so if the
top one or the bottom one go
we'll have electricity or Not

00:16:11.504-->00:16:18.477
[laughter] not okay can't laugh
you're gonna take my time
[laugh] not is gonna basically

00:16:18.477-->00:16:22.315
invert the signal we won't talk
about how we do that let's just
say you can do it in electronics

00:16:22.315-->00:16:27.954
if you're interested in that
think about that how does that
happen, google it The first

00:16:27.954-->00:16:31.657
fundamental piece I'm gonna
build so we have three
fundamental building blocks we

00:16:31.657-->00:16:37.063
have and or and we have not and
I claim that if you connect them
in this particular configuration

00:16:37.063-->00:16:41.234
I will have this thing that I'm
going to call an adder but this
is a half adder because there is

00:16:41.234-->00:16:47.206
not a thing which people call a
carry in this takes two bits of
information one and two and if

00:16:47.206-->00:16:52.879
they are both one out the ass in
comes a zero and a one which is
a carry if that doesn't make

00:16:52.879-->00:16:58.317
sense to you google it look up
half adder it's on wikipedia the
important point to take away is

00:16:58.317-->00:17:04.257
two bits of information in one
bit of information out and a
carry bit out so two in two out

00:17:04.257-->00:17:09.262
boom So we got to count how do I
make a counter? Trick question
ha I'm burning the time just to

00:17:12.064-->00:17:17.870
make you nervous [laugh] so
we're gonna take we're gonna
take that half adder and I'm

00:17:17.870-->00:17:21.674
gonna shove it inside a box and
this is called abstraction we do
this a lot we do it in

00:17:21.674-->00:17:25.144
everything we do every one of
those O P programming and all
these other things. I need to

00:17:25.144-->00:17:28.748
take circuits shove it into a
box because we're going to grow
complexly so everybody's

00:17:28.748-->00:17:32.251
comfortable with that that box
represents the two things coming
in one thing coming out with the

00:17:32.251-->00:17:37.290
CRY yes, go Incrementally better
I'm gonna stack these things I'm
going to take one I'm going to

00:17:37.290-->00:17:42.028
put it on top of the other now I
claim I can have two bits of
information coming in and two

00:17:42.028-->00:17:46.632
bits of information coming out
with the carry, everybody cool?
If you don't understand that

00:17:46.632-->00:17:53.606
look up half outer and stacking.
So that brings us to an
important point I said two bits

00:17:53.606-->00:17:58.010
in two bits out so we have to
use this thing we call hex to
represent the numbers if you're

00:17:58.010-->00:18:02.648
not familiar with why we use hex
I would challenge you to take a
bunch of switches from Home

00:18:02.648-->00:18:07.587
Depot home with you tonight and
take the first switch and sit
and look at it and say how many

00:18:07.587-->00:18:11.924
things can I represent with a
single switch, on and off, two
binary that's why a computer

00:18:11.924-->00:18:18.064
uses binary but I just said we
use hex not binary why is that
because on standard systems when

00:18:18.064-->00:18:22.134
we first started didn't make
sense you can't do a whole lot
with a single bit so we added a

00:18:22.134-->00:18:26.973
bunch of bits together the basic
standard bit so if I take one
switch I get two things if I

00:18:26.973-->00:18:32.244
take two switches I get how many
things? Four If I take three
switches I get how many? And if

00:18:32.244-->00:18:38.751
I take four switches? Sixteen so
we need at least four to
represent decimal which is our

00:18:38.751-->00:18:43.856
natural tendency to count
because we got ten of these
things right? So we have to go

00:18:43.856-->00:18:49.261
up to four bits but if we only
go to ten but we use four bits
we wasted some because you just

00:18:49.261-->00:18:53.099
told me we could go up to
sixteen we don't want to waste
those we want to be efficient so

00:18:53.099-->00:18:57.269
we use a different
representation or number base
also called a radix look it up

00:18:57.269-->00:19:02.241
and that number base is basic 16
also called hex by the way on a
side note there is a numbered

00:19:02.241-->00:19:07.146
number base or radix called
heximole which is base six which
is what I believe a pirate would

00:19:07.146-->00:19:12.151
count in because he has five
fingers and a hook [laughter] So
a bit negative okay you just

00:19:16.922-->00:19:20.626
told me the computer only has
one zero inside how do I deal
with negative numbers shit I

00:19:20.626-->00:19:26.265
don't know how to have a minus
sign oh shit we're at four
minutes let's go so I need to

00:19:26.265-->00:19:31.037
have a clever tricky way of
reassigning what numbers mean in
binary so that I can have

00:19:31.037-->00:19:35.041
negative there's this cool thing
called one's complement well
that kinda sucks because things

00:19:35.041-->00:19:40.312
didn't line up right look up
one's complement then look up
two's complement because we said

00:19:40.312-->00:19:44.650
I can take one's complement and
I can fix it so that we can do
this cool thing by having

00:19:44.650-->00:19:48.087
negative numbers that cancel
each other out when we add them
together and that's where two's

00:19:48.087-->00:19:51.857
complement comes from and I
claim that this circuit here
will give you two's complement

00:19:51.857-->00:19:56.929
representation of the number,
look it up. There's these things
called SOP and POS everybody

00:19:56.929-->00:20:02.935
hates in class so we're gonna
skip it [laughter] Get off your
half adder I claim that's a half

00:20:02.935-->00:20:06.739
adder because we didn't have a
carry in so we wanna fix that I
would claim that the logic of a

00:20:06.739-->00:20:11.744
carry is a and b added together
if A and B are both one then I
am going to get a carry. Full

00:20:14.513-->00:20:19.085
adder is what I get from that
we're gonna shove that into a
box because we're gonna abstract

00:20:19.085-->00:20:24.123
and go further because how many
how much time do we have left
five minutes Fully stacked now

00:20:24.123-->00:20:27.960
I'm going to take my full adders
I'm going to stack them together
this is representation of a two

00:20:27.960-->00:20:32.331
bit I would leave it as an
exercise to the reader to extend
it to four bit so we can get our

00:20:32.331-->00:20:37.336
four bit microprocessor guess
what it looks exactly the same
just keeps stacking So full if

00:20:40.072-->00:20:45.845
you have four full adders in a
box and put em together you get
what is known as a four bit

00:20:45.845-->00:20:49.648
adder you have a carry in you
have a four bit number on the
top four bit number on the

00:20:49.648-->00:20:53.953
bottom and out the other end
comes the answer plus the carry
so let's go would I steer you

00:20:53.953-->00:20:59.458
wrong okay we can now represent
numbers kind of inside but I
gotta steer stuff around inside

00:20:59.458-->00:21:03.596
the processor so how am I going
to do that I have to have a way
of steering stuff around we have

00:21:03.596-->00:21:08.601
these things we call mux many
come in one comes out I have a
way to choose it so this is kind

00:21:08.601-->00:21:12.838
of like a traffic cop inside I
also have to have the opposite I
have to have one come in and I

00:21:12.838-->00:21:16.909
can drive him to other places
with these two things called a
mux and a demux I can steer

00:21:16.909-->00:21:20.579
anything anywhere I want it to
go inside the processor, cool?
If you don't understand it,

00:21:20.579-->00:21:26.252
Google it. Stack the deck if I
take two muxes and put them
together I am building six

00:21:26.252-->00:21:30.956
minute okay we gotta go stack
the decks two muxes put together
out the other end I can control

00:21:30.956-->00:21:34.360
where data goes ya'll get the
point we're controlling a flow
of information inside the

00:21:34.360-->00:21:37.463
processor by the way why does
this matter because we're
eventually gonna get to

00:21:37.463-->00:21:41.167
registers and those matter when
you start doing code and you
start programming in assembly

00:21:41.167-->00:21:45.004
which you're gonna do if you're
gonna write shelf code so shut
up if you don't want to hear

00:21:45.004-->00:21:49.909
this [laugh] just kidding So
logic inside the processor in
order to not just be a

00:21:49.909-->00:21:54.046
calculator we have to have logic
right? We have to be able to do
logical functions on the data we

00:21:54.046-->00:21:58.951
put in or we have to be able to
do arithmetic so we have this
thing called ALU that's from the

00:21:58.951-->00:22:03.889
TV show V, ALU looks like a V if
you look at it those of you who
get the joke if not google it so

00:22:07.760-->00:22:12.598
you take all of this stuff you
shove it in the ones complement
the twos complement you put it

00:22:12.598-->00:22:18.304
in and we are going to create
this thing we call a NEG NOT
circuit a NEG NOT circuit says I

00:22:18.304-->00:22:22.408
have data coming in and coming
out and with those two control
lines down there I can either

00:22:22.408-->00:22:27.479
choose to negate it or get the
not of it so I have the ability
to do a function so ooh let's go

00:22:27.479-->00:22:32.284
and or with no pass through
information comes in comes out
at the ass end with the control

00:22:32.284-->00:22:36.722
here this is all abstraction
that we just built up to I can
take data in as it comes out I

00:22:36.722-->00:22:41.727
can choose to do an add or or it
so I have math and logic in that
place so this is with a pass all

00:22:44.096-->00:22:48.067
I did was stick a mux on the end
which we talked about before I
want the data to either be

00:22:48.067-->00:22:52.037
processed on or not processed on
that's what the mux is for
that's what the pass line is for

00:22:52.037-->00:22:58.244
let's go So I stick all that in
a box I get the and or chip ALU
there it is in all of it's glory

00:22:58.244-->00:23:02.248
that is basically in essence
what you have inside your
processor at home. Now there's

00:23:02.248-->00:23:05.584
been a delay there's this cool
thing called propagation delay
which we now don't have time to

00:23:05.584-->00:23:10.289
talk about because we're in a
hurry so look it up basically it
says data takes a matter of time

00:23:10.289-->00:23:15.995
to go through all this crap and
come out the ass end Now what we
have the ALU I need to be able

00:23:15.995-->00:23:20.099
to to produce input and store it
and then I'll have my fully
functioning computer so I have

00:23:20.099-->00:23:23.769
to have these things called
decoders but guess what that's
exactly the same thing as demux

00:23:23.769-->00:23:28.374
well shit why didn't you just
call it that in the first place
[laughter] so I can decode my

00:23:28.374-->00:23:33.712
decoders and decode the decoders
of the coders in which case I
can grow the address space and I

00:23:33.712-->00:23:37.383
can go from four bits to eight
bits sixteen bits etcetera
basically this is just stacking

00:23:37.383-->00:23:41.587
the coders so I have flip flops
flip flops are really cool
things that are latches inside

00:23:41.587-->00:23:45.624
that hold information so I can
now have not just a state
machine but I can hold stuff

00:23:45.624-->00:23:49.662
over time. Pick your logic
combinational or sequential
we're gonna talk about

00:23:49.662-->00:23:52.798
sequential cause that's what
computers are because we have to
have memory so we're not just

00:23:52.798-->00:23:56.869
based on the here and now or the
state So then we build these
things called registers which

00:23:56.869-->00:24:00.939
are a flip flop with the shit
coming in so we have the thing
that can hold information those

00:24:00.939-->00:24:05.411
registers are what you see when
you open up like IDa Pro and you
see register whatever that's

00:24:05.411-->00:24:09.948
what this is. Take a step back
general structure we're going to
get to this really quickly, how

00:24:09.948-->00:24:14.086
much time? >>one minute >>Oh
shit, brains this is the brain
that's microprocessor you got

00:24:14.086-->00:24:17.456
the ALU you got your memory
which we just assigned control
coming in you notice that

00:24:17.456-->00:24:20.959
control has nothing there shit
this is a brainless
microprocessor so we need a

00:24:20.959-->00:24:25.664
brain one so how do I do that? I
take that I've got buffers on
the side that's the data or the

00:24:25.664-->00:24:30.202
program I've got a thing called
the decoder which takes my
instructions but I don't know

00:24:30.202-->00:24:37.076
how to control it see all those
switches in the middle so I need
a thing called a ram we need to

00:24:37.076-->00:24:40.479
go from the one on the top where
the control lines are blank to
the one on the bottom and we'll

00:24:40.479-->00:24:45.117
have everything done PC address
generation PC it's called or
program counter we have to be

00:24:45.117-->00:24:48.854
able to step through the steps
in our program we saw we could
do an incrementor from an adder

00:24:48.854-->00:24:53.926
so we got that piece we got the
mux we have the thing called the
rom which basically defines all

00:24:53.926-->00:24:58.430
of the control signals for what
I want this thing to actually do
I put them all together and

00:24:58.430-->00:25:03.369
that's your full processor
[applause] Did I, Did I make it?
Did I make it? What time?

00:25:20.486-->00:25:25.491
>>five, four, three, two, one
[applause] >>So that's ten
minutes of your life you won't

00:25:33.532-->00:25:38.537
get back [laughter] How many of
you guys are in college? How
many of you have taken digital

00:25:41.106-->00:25:45.611
logic? Why don't you go to your
processor er your professor I
want you to manage your money

00:25:45.611-->00:25:50.616
back [laughter] say I got this
in ten minutes where's the cliff
notes? So not a joke little bit

00:25:55.721-->00:26:00.459
of feedback here because I
prefer to talk to you guys um I
hope I gave you some hooks of

00:26:00.459-->00:26:04.663
maybe some things to look up
about basically how a computer
works because a lot of people

00:26:04.663-->00:26:10.502
don't understand that and
everything's abstraction we went
from pounding rocks and starting

00:26:10.502-->00:26:17.075
fires to a playstation shit how
does that happen? Do you think
you're average person can tell

00:26:17.075-->00:26:19.945
me how the insides of a
playstation works no no no and
that's the whole point of

00:26:19.945-->00:26:24.683
abstraction is I'm going to
build up the pieces but I would
argue as hackers having these

00:26:24.683-->00:26:29.221
fundamental basic knowledge
points are what is going to
cause epiphanal stuff. I will

00:26:29.221-->00:26:33.792
argue with anyone right now
everyone will say oh there's no
longer a need to program in

00:26:33.792-->00:26:39.731
assembly mkay I'll have the
argument with you. Or I'll have
an edify discussion with you

00:26:39.731-->00:26:42.968
where you'll teach me stuff that
I don't know and I'll change my
mind because that's the other

00:26:42.968-->00:26:45.938
thing that people in this
community need to be willing to
do you need to be able to change

00:26:45.938-->00:26:50.075
your mind if somebody explains
something to you that makes more
sense. And I think there's too

00:26:50.075-->00:26:55.080
many people that get fixated on
their uh their ideas. So excuse
me I'm gonna take one more drink

00:26:59.785-->00:27:04.723
of water because that really
took it out of me. I want
everybody in this audience right

00:27:08.827-->00:27:13.198
now to find one person next to
them that's not somebody they
know and introduce yourself in

00:27:13.198-->00:27:18.203
the next 30 seconds [inaudible
audience conversations] Okay
okay okay okay wow is that

00:27:31.550-->00:27:36.555
longer than 30 seconds? I lost
control. Alright let's focus
focus focus focus [inaudible

00:27:57.342-->00:28:02.281
conversations continue] Oh okay
okay okay okay bring it back in
people bring it in come on come

00:28:23.068-->00:28:28.073
on come on come on hello hello
hello hello hi alright thank you
okay well that what just

00:28:46.024-->00:28:50.128
happened just then is fucking
awesome because that's what
Defcon is for me is the people

00:28:50.128-->00:28:54.666
and the interaction okay those
of you came here thinking I'm
gonna sit with my laptop unless

00:28:54.666-->00:29:00.205
you're doing CTF or you're doing
my challenge but this is the
best part about my challenge CTF

00:29:00.205-->00:29:03.609
you know they're going to sit in
isolation with your team with
your head down and your laptop

00:29:03.609-->00:29:06.612
and you're not going to talk to
anyone. You're going to do my
challenge you're going to talk

00:29:06.612-->00:29:08.680
to other people because you
don't have a choice so it's all
about the people for me. By the

00:29:08.680-->00:29:13.418
way I I just morbid curiosity
how did the uh teleprompter
people do with that that

00:29:13.418-->00:29:18.423
monstrosity we just went
through? [applause] Awesome
awesome so how did they deal

00:29:22.761-->00:29:27.766
with uh foreign language did we
see >>Lost my friend >>Yes
>>first time speaker >>I'm not a

00:29:30.002-->00:29:35.007
first time speaker >>[inaudible
question] >>I I don't I don't
drink but thank you, I will I

00:29:40.679-->00:29:45.684
will, thank you very much
[laughter] thank you so that's a
perfect example yes we have fun

00:29:53.859-->00:29:58.864
at Defcon, I encourage you to
challenge the speakers if
someone is saying something here

00:30:03.035-->00:30:07.239
that you think is bullshit go up
and talk to them okay? Challenge
people that's what we're here

00:30:07.239-->00:30:10.342
for I want people to challenge
me I want you to come up to me
and be like dude I thought that

00:30:10.342-->00:30:15.347
was crap or whatever that's how
I get better, so yeah, so I will
uh prepare you for 101 if you go

00:30:21.553-->00:30:26.258
or not 101 uh opening ceremony
is tomorrow so like I said
usually Thursday was our fun day

00:30:26.258-->00:30:29.995
where we were just kind of
joking around but it's kind of
evolved into another official

00:30:29.995-->00:30:33.699
day of Defcon, Defcon didn't
used to be Thursday Friday
Saturday Sunday used to be

00:30:33.699-->00:30:39.337
Friday Saturday Sunday so this
is uh this isn't technically
Defcon because we haven't

00:30:39.337-->00:30:45.444
officially opened the conference
yet but I think that's crap so
>>Yes it is, 101 is official,

00:30:45.444-->00:30:50.449
yeah! >>It is now, it is now,
but it wasn't >>it is now that
you're here [laughter] >>So so

00:30:52.484-->00:30:57.089
after this talk by the way there
will be a 101 panel where we're
going to interact with you guys

00:30:57.089-->00:31:01.426
more and talk with you more and
then tomorrow opening ceremonies
I will talk more specifically

00:31:01.426-->00:31:06.298
about the badge and some of the
production and some of the
problems we had and some of the

00:31:06.298-->00:31:11.036
craziness in the program but I
kinda like to give a reward to
the folks that make the effort

00:31:11.036-->00:31:17.008
of coming to the 101 stuff and
talk just a slightly about uh
some of the challenge stuff that

00:31:17.008-->00:31:20.479
may give you a little bit of a
leg up if you're competing with
other people. How many people in

00:31:20.479-->00:31:24.750
this room are actually working
on some aspect of the puzzle
right now? Or have? Or have

00:31:24.750-->00:31:29.755
thought about it? Okay um it I
hope it's kind of fun um it's a
little bit painful at times so

00:31:32.357-->00:31:37.796
let's talk a little bit about
the uh the math that you see in
the program if you look in the

00:31:37.796-->00:31:42.801
program on the second page where
my ugly mug is at um there's a
there's some equations there.

00:31:48.206-->00:31:54.913
Everybody see those? Everybody
see that? The math that's there?
How many of you liked in there

00:31:54.913-->00:31:59.918
and you were like hell no I
didn't come to Defcon to
freaking do math. Hell no! How

00:32:02.053-->00:32:06.792
many of you are familiar with a
website called Wolfram Alpha?
Yeah. How many of you tried to

00:32:06.792-->00:32:12.130
put that equation into wolfram
alpha and how many of you got
with what the fuck am I looking

00:32:12.130-->00:32:16.868
at? [laughter] Now second thing
that was designed to stump you
guys and see what I'm doing is

00:32:16.868-->00:32:20.572
I'm talking about an aspect of
the challenge that hopefully
will give you a hook or piece of

00:32:20.572-->00:32:23.742
information you might not have
already known if you did you're
really freaking smart come talk

00:32:23.742-->00:32:28.747
to me because I want to know
you. Um there is a there is a
way of representing equations in

00:32:31.249-->00:32:35.287
uh basically in a in the line of
text because you're like how the
hell do I put an integral symbol

00:32:35.287-->00:32:39.324
in how do we do that stuff?
There is a thing you can look up
called a reverse polish notation

00:32:39.324-->00:32:45.397
and it sounds like you're being
like racist but it's it's not
it's really called RPN for short

00:32:45.397-->00:32:51.670
reverse polish notation and it's
the way those of us who are old
like me used to put data into a

00:32:51.670-->00:32:56.675
a a com- holy crap I just
realized I just realized no but
I just realized you you are like

00:32:58.910-->00:33:04.983
a foot taller than last year
>>woo! >>Stand up for a second,
those of you who don't know this

00:33:04.983-->00:33:09.554
young man right here this is one
of the smartest kids I've ever
met he came to Defcon what two

00:33:09.554-->00:33:16.094
years ago is your first one?
Four? He was like this tall his
dad brings him and he br he

00:33:16.094-->00:33:20.498
brings his dad I think and this
is why I love Defcon this kind
of stuff he was correcting

00:33:20.498-->00:33:26.471
speakers he was correcting like
Joe Grand and me and stuff like
that introduce yourself to this

00:33:26.471-->00:33:30.609
kid because he's going to go
places uh those of you who have
like these track programs for

00:33:30.609-->00:33:34.312
hiring people like when they're
young this is a kid you guys
need to meet his name's Skylar

00:33:34.312-->00:33:39.317
anyway by the way, say hi
[applause] So >>that is one of
the best parts of con was the

00:33:41.920-->00:33:46.925
look on Joe Grands face when he
corrected him [laughter] >>Okay
so I did I did a puzzle badge

00:33:49.928-->00:33:54.366
for a conference called the
gathering for gardner how many
of you know who Martin Gardner

00:33:54.366-->00:34:00.872
is he is the father of what we
call recreational mathematics
and he's also like the champ he

00:34:00.872-->00:34:05.410
used to write for scientific
american doing like puzzle stuff
and most of you who've done

00:34:05.410-->00:34:11.483
puzzley type stuff like in the
newspaper or in magazines he
probably influenced that somehow

00:34:11.483-->00:34:17.355
he's a pioneer I I I've got much
respect to Martin who is no
longer with us um at that

00:34:17.355-->00:34:21.760
conference basically I found we
had two camps of people we had
mathematicians and we had

00:34:21.760-->00:34:26.998
professional magicians which is
a really interesting mix and I
met this guy he comes up to me

00:34:26.998-->00:34:32.003
and was introduced himself and
apparently uh how many of you
know what XKCD is? Yeah So XKCD

00:34:34.306-->00:34:40.745
had written a comic strip about
the tool that this guy wrote and
he came up to me and he he had

00:34:40.745-->00:34:44.582
heard that I was like this
puzzle guy and I do all this
puzzle stuff and he goes I I

00:34:44.582-->00:34:50.021
made this thing and it got a lot
of press because XKCD featured
it and I was in like his website

00:34:50.021-->00:34:54.225
got all this kind and he goes
but nobody uses it I said you
know what I'm going to use it

00:34:54.225-->00:34:58.330
I'm going to use it at Defcon
and I'm going to give you credit
for it and I'm going to make

00:34:58.330-->00:35:03.868
sure people drive so there is a
tool and I have a challenge for
people at this conference find

00:35:03.868-->00:35:08.873
the XKCD comic the tool and the
name of the author before the
end of Defcon and come to the

00:35:11.042-->00:35:15.880
1057 room and tell that
information to me and I will
have something for you. So that

00:35:15.880-->00:35:19.618
is me giving kind of like a mini
challenge to the folks who don't
want to get hard core into the

00:35:19.618-->00:35:26.358
competition it shouldn't take
you very much time with Google
to to find but in his algorithm

00:35:26.358-->00:35:32.831
he is able to put in a number
and generate functions and
equations that produce that

00:35:32.831-->00:35:37.869
number now you're saying to
yourself oh this is passe this
is easy I have lots of

00:35:37.869-->00:35:42.574
processing power now I will just
do an exhaustive search bullshit
for any of you who understand

00:35:42.574-->00:35:47.712
how complexity grows that is not
what this guy is doing and this
algorithm is brilliant and I

00:35:47.712-->00:35:52.751
bring it up for a reason because
I'm convinced that someone out
here is in hearing what I'm

00:35:52.751-->00:35:56.955
saying right now is gonna look
at that and is gonna get
inspired in a way to use that

00:35:56.955-->00:36:01.659
algorithm because I have an
intuitive feel that that
particular algorithm is

00:36:01.659-->00:36:06.164
applicable to some other aspects
of what we do as hackers that I
haven't quite put my thumb on

00:36:06.164-->00:36:11.436
yet and if one of you finds it
just give me a nod or something
I don't care but I really

00:36:11.436-->00:36:15.306
believe somebody out there is
working on a problem or working
on an exploit or working on

00:36:15.306-->00:36:21.479
something in security that this
particular uh algorithm would be
useful for I don't know what it

00:36:21.479-->00:36:26.251
is but I'm throwing that
challenge out there and you
remember I said this and it's

00:36:26.251-->00:36:30.755
being recorded so when some guy
wins the nobel prize or does
something amazing I can be like

00:36:30.755-->00:36:35.760
I helped make that happen and
that's what this is really all
about okay I am about dead on my

00:36:37.896-->00:36:43.701
feet this is what I had for you
guys for 101 I want to know if
you guys have any questions for

00:36:43.701-->00:36:50.008
me because I prefer to talk you
guys are new to Defcon ask me
anything you want like hey I'm

00:36:50.008-->00:36:55.013
new to Defcon yeah, what type of
IC on the is on he's asking what
type of chips on the badge who

00:36:57.816-->00:37:02.754
knows? What is it? It's an intel
quark d2000 what does that mean
it means its x86 compatible

00:37:08.293-->00:37:13.298
ooooh yeah any other questions
before I fall over and we set up
for the panel no? No qu- really?

00:37:17.168-->00:37:20.271
no questions and I'm giving you
carte blanche like why do you
wear those shoes why are you

00:37:20.271-->00:37:25.276
wearing rod serling on your
shirt yeah? Yell it! [inaudible
question] You mean like this? Oh

00:37:31.850-->00:37:37.789
the lanyards so so I have a
question for you why would I
make different lanyards and then

00:37:37.789-->00:37:42.794
just give it all out in picture
oh meet space DDOS this is meet
space oh after the after the

00:37:45.964-->00:37:50.468
fact so generally people that
compete in my competition tend
to write up descriptions of what

00:37:50.468-->00:37:55.373
they had to do to solve the
problems and I guarantee
somebody will have done that so

00:37:55.373-->00:38:00.311
it this is confession sorry guys
I usually count on them doing
that so I don't have to

00:38:05.183-->00:38:10.121
[laughter] I really wanna thank
you guys for coming out I hope
you yeah yeah go [inaudible

00:38:10.121-->00:38:17.128
question] Okay so I'll save it
for the panel alright I'll save
it for the panel, thank you guys

00:38:17.128-->00:38:19.197
for coming. Oh and these are
awesome Gunnar glasses that I
love so thank you guys for

00:38:19.197-->00:38:21.199
coming [applause]
