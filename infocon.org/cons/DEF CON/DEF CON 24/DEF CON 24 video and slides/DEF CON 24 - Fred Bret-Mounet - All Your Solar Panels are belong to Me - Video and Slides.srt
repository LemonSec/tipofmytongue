00:00:05.706,00:00:10.711
[applause] >> First thing I need
to record my selfie. [pause]
[off mic comments] [pause] [off

00:00:31.198,00:00:36.169
mic comments] [whistles heckling
from audience] [pause] >> Thanks
you guys. Whatever the outcome

00:00:36.169,00:00:41.174
is I have evidence that it was a
success. [laughter] Semi
success. Um [speaks in French]

00:00:54.454,00:00:58.225
[off mic comments] Excellent!
[pause] [off mic comments]
[breath] Oh god! Lift You guys

00:00:58.225,00:01:03.163
are working on that? Okay.
[speaks in French until 1:06] Um
for the yeah sorry closed

00:01:10.370,00:01:16.843
captioning. Sorry folks. A
wonderful French movie um called
The Dinner Game. Very dark

00:01:16.843,00:01:21.848
French humor. Um who has solar
panels? Who cares about their
privacy? Yeah! You didn't um

00:01:28.221,00:01:34.127
raise your hand. Get out.
[laughter] There's an EFF talk I
think next door. You can ask

00:01:34.127,00:01:39.132
about privacy. Still nothing? Is
it working on that side? Yeah.
Who's seen War Games? Excellent

00:01:42.536,00:01:47.541
movie. It hasn't aged a minute.
[laughter] I did. Um but even if
uh Litchfield was cool I was

00:01:53.680,00:01:58.018
much more serious about my
craft. Serious enough not to
have the distraction of a

00:01:58.018,00:02:04.891
girlfriend. By choice of course.
Um [laughter] This quote is
excellent. It is actually what I

00:02:04.891,00:02:11.264
believe I am. Trying to take
things opening them up and
figuring out ways to make them

00:02:11.264,00:02:16.269
better. Isn't that why you're
all here? [pause, whistle,
pause] It's not happy hour yet.

00:02:21.141,00:02:26.146
Hey by the way I need my speaker
shot. I could use 2 actually.
[off mic comment] Thank you!

00:02:32.753,00:02:37.758
[yell from audience, pause] So
we're going to talk solar. Um
this is a system by Tygo.

00:02:40.494,00:02:45.732
[pause] I brought the little
part that is the only piece
we're going to look at today.

00:02:45.732,00:02:50.737
Which is the the connection
between the solar array and the
internet. [pause] It's really

00:02:55.075,00:03:00.013
cool because not only does it
upload configure um production
data to the internet. It also

00:03:02.015,00:03:07.020
downloads configuration of the
panels. Things like maximum um
power voltage maximum

00:03:10.457,00:03:15.462
temperature of the panels and
things like that. Of course over
the internet um what it does is

00:03:21.568,00:03:28.475
gives the installer the ability
to monitor remotely the
production of my system. Why?

00:03:28.475,00:03:31.545
Because they have an SLA and
they actually guarantee
production of my array and

00:03:31.545,00:03:36.550
they'll pay me back if it
doesn't produce what it's
expected to. Yes indeed. Um I

00:03:39.519,00:03:44.524
could. I would not. Cause think
about it. About 9000 Kilowatt
hours a year of production. This

00:03:52.132,00:03:57.137
says 15 cents. Yes I could score
a thousand two thousand bucks
but I would get busted for it.

00:04:00.941,00:04:06.613
Because this is not the only
thing that reports my
production. So that angle you

00:04:06.613,00:04:11.618
can have fun um not with me.
[pause] This is what's what
started it all. You know how you

00:04:15.388,00:04:20.393
take your nest and or any IOT
device when you initially power
it it starts advertising and

00:04:22.629,00:04:28.835
access point. Uh you connect to
it. Configure it. Tell it this
is my home network. And then it

00:04:28.835,00:04:33.840
shuts down and becomes just a
wifi client. Not this one. It
connects both to my network as

00:04:36.409,00:04:41.414
well as the open access point.
Um that really really bugged me.
[pause] So started to need to

00:04:46.052,00:04:52.792
figure I needed to figure out
how to fix that problem. And
started inventorying all the

00:04:52.792,00:04:57.797
attack surfaces I had uh at my
disposal. We talked about the
access point. And little HDTP

00:05:00.834,00:05:05.839
server that we'll talk about
later. SSH cool. Yeah except
there's a built in uh defense in

00:05:10.010,00:05:16.516
depth maybe. It crashes after 15
hundred tries. I have to
re-power the uh res power cycle

00:05:16.516,00:05:21.521
the device. So quickly it was no
longer funny. Um serial to TCP.
I never got it to work

00:05:24.124,00:05:29.129
unfortunately. But it had a nice
little UI. Do you want the uh
the console to be tunneled

00:05:31.264,00:05:36.770
through TCP or the display. This
little guy. Or the gateway that
it controls through uh through

00:05:36.770,00:05:41.775
um serial port. [pause] From a
physical perspective of course I
opened that box. Remember what I

00:05:45.912,00:05:50.917
told you? I take a screwdriver
to anything. Um [pause] nicely
labeled at the bottom left of

00:05:54.487,00:05:59.492
the screen. You see a little uh
silkscreen of console. Guess
what. You plug in your um serial

00:06:02.862,00:06:07.867
to USB connector and it works.
So I had a nice console
interface. Which unfortunately

00:06:10.804,00:06:15.809
required authentication. So back
to square one. U boot.
Excellent. Maybe I could boot it

00:06:18.745,00:06:25.051
in recovery mode fix the
password. No unfortunately they
put a password on the uh on the

00:06:25.051,00:06:30.056
boot loader. And yeah I have a
confession. I live in
California. This was October.

00:06:34.194,00:06:40.734
The middle of winter. This
device is outdoors. It was too
hard for me to take. So I had to

00:06:40.734,00:06:45.739
look at an easier path and more
comfortable. Um so [pause]
Behind this access point there

00:06:51.811,00:06:58.485
is a website. As I mentioned.
That website has properties. If
you use showdon you'll find out

00:06:58.485,00:07:03.423
that actually 12 or so uh very
courageous people maybe ignorant
decided to have that device also

00:07:10.397,00:07:15.402
internet accessible. [pause]
Guys this is where you're
supposed to laugh. Thank you.

00:07:20.674,00:07:25.679
[chuckle] Um [pause] thanks to
showdon I was able to verify
that my findings actually no my

00:07:28.982,00:07:33.987
lawyer's not present so do what
you want with he Showdon
findings. Um [pause] Remember

00:07:37.190,00:07:43.463
the open access point? It has an
SS ID. So I went to those
wonderful folks at wiggle dot

00:07:43.463,00:07:50.403
net. And uh looked at their
database. Guess what. I'm not
the only one who detected those.

00:07:50.403,00:07:55.408
Uh they're all over the world.
And they're captured for
posterity. You know have GPS

00:07:57.477,00:08:02.415
coordinates of all of those
devices or some of those
devices. Um who war drives?

00:08:05.285,00:08:10.290
Thank you. Keep doing it. Upload
to wiggle um because it's a
treasure trove of data about

00:08:13.827,00:08:18.832
people that like I want to say F
up no mess up. Let's go back to
the web server. [pause] That's

00:08:23.336,00:08:29.275
it. My talk is over. Thank you.
Um there's an authentication
screen we can't do much about it

00:08:29.275,00:08:34.280
can we? Of course not. It's
funny how I've seen other slide
decks today that also use a

00:08:38.485,00:08:43.490
password file called rock Q dot
txt. Who's used it in the past?
[pause] Oh come on guys. If you

00:08:48.261,00:08:53.266
didn't raise your hand that's
the best password file on earth.
Um so I ran my brute force. 36

00:08:57.937,00:09:02.876
hour later yeah I know I know
I'm lazy but it was 36 computers
at computer hours not mine. Um

00:09:05.078,00:09:10.083
turns out admin support works
very well. [laughter] Okay where
do we go from there? Looking

00:09:15.355,00:09:21.261
around the little website on the
server. There's a nice little
page that caught my attention.

00:09:21.261,00:09:27.967
No such file or directory.
Ooooo, guess what happens when
you put a file there? Um for

00:09:27.967,00:09:33.773
those of you who don't have
their url decode option on
Google glasses this is what it

00:09:33.773,00:09:38.778
looks like. [pause] Copy shadow
file in to that location. What
would happen? Yeah I might break

00:09:42.816,00:09:47.821
my 20 thousand dollars solar
array by putting something
there. Um but I didn't. [pause]

00:09:51.891,00:09:56.896
By the way this MD5 I tried to
brute force it. I failed. If you
ever get to it I believe it is

00:10:01.734,00:10:06.739
still on those devices. Um
please send me an email. I would
appreciate it. So that that

00:10:09.108,00:10:15.281
route didn't work out. Um I
needed something easier.
Remember I can I can essentially

00:10:15.281,00:10:20.286
run a script through that
injection. Um so PS all oh guess
what? The HTDP server is running

00:10:25.592,00:10:30.597
under root. Bingo. Also the
manufacturer is nice enough has
net cap already on the device.

00:10:33.500,00:10:38.505
Ooooo [laughter] By the way I
won't admit that in public but
it still took me 4 to 6 hours to

00:10:41.674,00:10:46.679
get my reverse shell working.
But I didn't say that. Um I did
eventually get it working. I had

00:10:49.282,00:10:55.321
root on that device. What do you
do with root? I know what I
didn't do. I didn't get a copy

00:10:55.321,00:11:00.260
of the file system. So once I
was locked out I no longer had
anything to work on. But after a

00:11:04.731,00:11:09.736
little bit of uh kung fu with
the drive uh mount [pause util
11:16] come on [applause] I know

00:11:19.412,00:11:24.417
I know it feels good to pretend
I'm that good. Um what I did was
not rocket science. I just had

00:11:26.653,00:11:31.658
the time to do it. [pause]
Clearly that manufacturer picked
the wrong customer to sell a

00:11:38.531,00:11:43.536
device to. I'm sure they're
still regretting that move. Um
it probably cost them a lot more

00:11:45.538,00:11:50.543
in uh cleanup then it did uh in
profits. So anyhow looking
around the file system something

00:11:53.646,00:11:59.852
caught my attention. Actually
not the file system the running
processes. Open VPN. You guys

00:11:59.852,00:12:04.791
know what open VPN is for? A VPN
tunnel. Guess what. That VPN
tunnel was on at all times on

00:12:07.794,00:12:12.799
the device. I didn't do it. And
I swear this is not a joke. I
did not scan that VPN subnet.

00:12:16.369,00:12:21.374
The manufacturer confirmed that
all of its little siblings are
on that subnet. [pause] Of

00:12:27.513,00:12:32.518
course no where was it mentioned
in any of the documentation that
nobody ever reads that there was

00:12:35.321,00:12:41.961
a VPN. Remember that device that
is still on my home network? I
was trusting it even though it

00:12:41.961,00:12:46.966
didn't appear trustable. I was
still doing that. Um so let's
move on to me trying to get

00:12:50.169,00:12:55.174
something done about the device.
So I tried politely in October
to get their attention. Hey

00:12:57.677,00:13:03.549
guys. There might be a problem.
You know it it I'd like to talk
to someone who actually

00:13:03.549,00:13:08.554
understand security. Yeah by the
way in the back? If the font
size is too small next time

00:13:10.790,00:13:15.795
remember that DefCon is all
about line con. Get early to the
talk. [laugh] So a few emails

00:13:21.100,00:13:26.105
later um while still trying to
reach to people that might
understand me through LinkedIn

00:13:29.676,00:13:34.681
my in clueless installer and his
contacts I got nowhere. Actually
it got even worse. We're now in

00:13:38.818,00:13:43.823
mid December. Are you the owner
of this device? Do you have the
right to do what you're doing?

00:13:48.895,00:13:53.900
Yeah I've seen that play out not
that well. Um [laughter] They
actually already had my full

00:13:57.403,00:14:02.141
name my email address my
everything. They already knew
everything about me but they

00:14:02.141,00:14:07.146
couldn't find me in the
database. Um this was the icing
on the cake. For those in the

00:14:09.282,00:14:16.189
back I will read what is
highlighted. Or I'll I'll
paraphrase. We can help you get

00:14:16.189,00:14:21.194
access to the system. Do I need
access to the system at that
point? No. I can help myself. Um

00:14:24.230,00:14:29.235
and I I need to read that one.
Quote Info of system installed
on your roof is always kept as

00:14:32.171,00:14:38.811
confidential since it was
installed. Apparently before it
is installed not guaranteed and

00:14:38.811,00:14:43.816
you know English is my second
language I don't I don't
understand that sentence. So

00:14:47.086,00:14:52.592
time to stay to change strategy.
Clearly I'm getting nowhere.
I've been at it for 2 months

00:14:52.592,00:14:57.597
already. Um I'm talking to the
wrong kind of support. So I send
this email. What I'm saying

00:15:01.267,00:15:06.572
there is hey guys here's a
picture you remember the root
picture? Here's a picture. The

00:15:06.572,00:15:11.944
last line doesn't belong there.
Forward this to whoever's in
charge. I don't want to talk to

00:15:11.944,00:15:16.949
you no more. Remember the VPN
tunnel? Within an hour they were
logging in on that device and

00:15:22.021,00:15:28.961
they were staring cleaning up.
Not not security cleaning up.
Damage control cleaning up.

00:15:28.961,00:15:34.700
Disabling my account. Shutting
down the web server. Uh and
things like that in the process

00:15:34.700,00:15:39.705
yeah disabling my entire array
went offline for 4 to 6 hours.
Um I was not done helping guys.

00:15:42.608,00:15:48.648
Please. I was trying to be nice.
Um thankfully I didn't tell them
about one thing I had found

00:15:48.648,00:15:53.653
while browsing the file system.
In that CGI bin folder there's
also a file called shell.

00:15:56.856,00:16:01.794
[laughter] So I got back in and
uh told them the next day about
it. And repeat. So that's the

00:16:07.834,00:16:14.774
best part. Once I got to talk to
someone in charge of their
product development. Great guy.

00:16:14.774,00:16:19.779
Um his first response was
there's a problem. This is not a
production device. What? I

00:16:23.749,00:16:28.754
bought a Tesla and the Tesla
price and the auto pilot crashes
on me because it's a debug

00:16:31.724,00:16:37.296
version I have? No sorry Tesla
guys. I'm just jealous.
Everybody in my neighborhood has

00:16:37.296,00:16:42.301
one except for me. So if you
guys are thankful for the talk
don't hesitate. Thank You.

00:16:49.842,00:16:54.046
[laughter] [applause] Um
[applause] So 6 months later I'm
pretty sure they were actually

00:16:54.046,00:16:59.785
not lying. It was a very
convenient excuse. But they
happen to ship me a development

00:16:59.785,00:17:04.724
build. And a few thousand others
uh throughout the world. [pause]
god [pause] What they did well

00:17:12.732,00:17:18.070
once I had a line of
communication with Tygo they
were actually very welcoming of

00:17:18.070,00:17:23.075
my finding. And relatively
forthcoming with sharing the
insider information. Like for

00:17:25.845,00:17:31.417
example telling me oh all of
those devices are on the same
subnet through the VPN tunnel.

00:17:31.417,00:17:38.090
Um that would have been
preferable for not them not to
tell me that. Um one thing I

00:17:38.090,00:17:43.095
discovered lot shipping.
Specially for the one oh this is
a very important question guys.

00:17:47.833,00:17:52.838
Who in the audience is a black
hat versus a white hat? Come on
raise your hands. Oh my god

00:17:54.941,00:17:59.946
there's not a single hand up.
[laugh] Yeah okay. [laugh] Um so
next time you go into a system

00:18:02.114,00:18:07.119
you're not authorized to think
about disconnecting it from the
network before. Because this guy

00:18:09.488,00:18:14.493
ships its logs every half an
hour. And boy was I noisy. Of
course there was nobody looking.

00:18:16.696,00:18:21.701
Thank god. [laugh] But uh it's
it's important to realize that
even small IOT devices have that

00:18:25.071,00:18:30.076
capability. And uh you might
trigger a few alerts if you're
not too careful. So got root. I

00:18:36.015,00:18:42.588
made fun of the vendor. Why am I
talking about this? And this is
actually the most important

00:18:42.588,00:18:49.061
slide of the entire
presentation. Yeah I could
remotely see this little red

00:18:49.061,00:18:54.066
button? There's software behind
it. I could remotely shut down
any of those thousands of solar

00:18:56.969,00:19:01.907
arrays. I could be a pain to
people off the grid. Maybe. I
don't have there's not enough

00:19:04.877,00:19:11.217
electricity production for it to
be meaningful yet. It will be in
a few years. But not today.

00:19:11.217,00:19:17.056
What's more important is this is
a bought. I could have a
thousand of those remotely

00:19:17.056,00:19:22.061
controlled on your whole network
spying on your home activity.
You know oh shoot my my kid is

00:19:27.299,00:19:32.304
here so I can't say prawn but
things like that. Um [pause] The
biggest part the part that bugs

00:19:38.344,00:19:43.349
me the most is even though I've
been a security practitioner for
a long time. Only after this

00:19:47.586,00:19:52.591
device being on my network did I
realize I really needed 2
networks. My home personal

00:19:55.928,00:20:00.933
network and a completely
independent IOT network. On
which I have of course this guy

00:20:03.302,00:20:08.307
now. He was the first candidate.
But the nest um a few
development boards. Who's played

00:20:11.210,00:20:16.215
with the particle photon
photons? Yeah. Those are
excellent devices. Um but just

00:20:19.318,00:20:25.958
like this guy don't trust them.
Um my security cameras you know
those cameras that I bought on

00:20:25.958,00:20:30.963
allibaba with that Chinese
firmware? That is apparently
very chatty. Uh I won't go

00:20:33.132,00:20:38.137
further. So yeah. Is your mom or
your brother or your family
expected to have 2 networks at

00:20:42.775,00:20:47.780
home and to be able to manage
those? No. There is no way that
that even us handle it. There is

00:20:51.283,00:20:56.288
no way that customers of IOTs
can be expected to actually
protect themselves from those

00:21:00.292,00:21:05.297
devices. That is a very sad
state and I hope that message
comes out of DefCon as much as

00:21:09.034,00:21:14.039
possible. Because it is time
that we have a URL rating of
devices uh that also takes into

00:21:17.276,00:21:22.047
account your privacy. Cause we
all have that expectation. You
don't buy a car without seat

00:21:22.047,00:21:27.052
belts. [applause] Yes.
[applause] Responsible
disclosure is hard. Yes. Don't

00:21:34.026,00:21:39.031
give up. Please. Follow
responsible disclosure. And
finally. Thank you to all IOT

00:21:42.701,00:21:47.706
devices for so much
entertainment. [laugh] Thank you
to quite a few people. My wife

00:21:51.010,00:21:56.015
for tolerating my late nights.
Uh Rafael where are you? Stand
up. [pause] Keep doing your

00:22:02.388,00:22:07.393
packet storming. [applause] And
ty Tygo for not suing me. Thank
you. Uh you got me scared there.

00:22:12.665,00:22:17.670
Guys thank you. [applause] [off
mic comment] Yeah you screwed up
[fades out]
