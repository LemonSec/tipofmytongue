00:00:00.334,00:00:06.807
>>Okay well I think we're just
gonna start and we'll see what
happens with the video >>Um

00:00:06.807,00:00:10.611
[inaudible voices] >>Um we had
this whole strategy, we have
this great photo core team

00:00:10.611,00:00:15.015
that's been taking pictures all
weekend long and we arranged
this great photo montage of

00:00:15.015,00:00:18.151
everything that was happening
and we were gonna play it to you
as you came in and then we were

00:00:18.151,00:00:24.725
gonna have this great number 1
and number 2 winning teams uh
entries for the uh TD Francis

00:00:24.725,00:00:29.196
Film Festival uh contest and as
you've see we still don't have
the screens working. [applause]

00:00:32.900,00:00:36.403
[clears throat] [applause] Wooh!
[applause] [inaudible voices]
hang on we're gettin' ready to

00:00:36.403,00:00:41.408
>>Excellent >>Hang on we're
gettin' ready to turn em off
again [laughter] >>So instead I

00:00:44.077,00:00:47.581
think it just looks like we're
gonna release all of the photos
from the photo core. We do that

00:00:47.581,00:00:51.451
every year. We'll release all
the photos and we'll have all
the winning uh and all the

00:00:51.451,00:00:55.589
runners up to the film contest.
We'll put em all online. We'll
Tweet it. It'll be on our

00:00:55.589,00:01:00.027
Youtube and everything and I
just apologize to those teams in
contest that we didn't get this

00:01:00.027,00:01:06.366
working in time. So uh in the
name of efficiency we're gonna
jump right into this and one of

00:01:06.366,00:01:11.471
them is thank you for attending
Rise of The Machines Defcon 24.
[applause] [hollering] Thank

00:01:11.471,00:01:16.476
you. [applause] [hollering[
[applause] So some of you
might've noticed. There was a

00:01:21.014,00:01:27.287
slight badge uh screw up and we
tried as hard as we could to
substitute back the paper badges

00:01:27.287,00:01:33.860
with the uh real badges and I'm
not gonna get into all the
minutia but I'll just suffice to

00:01:33.860,00:01:40.233
say I Tweeted uh that it started
with a typhoon off of Taiwan and
it truly was like one of these

00:01:40.233,00:01:45.205
butterfly effects. So if we
can't do it in Taiwan, we'll do
it in the states but if we're

00:01:45.205,00:01:48.675
doin it in the states they have
different inventory. So then we
have to use different components

00:01:48.675,00:01:52.312
but then we have to redesign the
board but then we have to
redesign the PCB but then we

00:01:52.312,00:01:59.152
have to and it cascaded and
cascaded and cascaded from this
one uh mother nature event and

00:01:59.152,00:02:04.658
it just got crazier and crazier.
So we really apologize about
that. We did our best to get you

00:02:04.658,00:02:09.863
whatever we had in stock
whatever we could get from our
supplier um but I think that it

00:02:09.863,00:02:15.068
was Russ observed that really
the machines did launch the
first attack here because as we

00:02:15.068,00:02:20.974
all know uh the machines control
the weather. [laughter] Just
like the illuminati party which

00:02:20.974,00:02:25.912
uh controls the world. Some of
you have not noticed that there
is an illumabod illuminati party

00:02:25.912,00:02:30.550
and they held up an event the
other night. Um I was not
invited but I'm working on

00:02:30.550,00:02:34.988
joining the illuminati because
what I wanna do is I wanna
create an illuminati within the

00:02:34.988,00:02:40.761
illuminati. [laughter] Because
while they're busy controlling
us I think we can maybe control

00:02:40.761,00:02:45.799
them and then they'll suffer the
same paranoia that we have.
It'll be kind of circular it'll

00:02:45.799,00:02:50.804
be fantastic. So this us badge
problem meant that all the
badges arrived on site or the

00:02:54.574,00:03:01.448
majority of them and our teams
over 50 people we stayed up in
shifts for over 48 hours

00:03:01.448,00:03:08.155
building all of the badges with
custom uh programmers. Uh
everybody ran out it was it was

00:03:08.155,00:03:13.093
the coolest thing in hacker
culture is that everybody wants
to solve the problem and so they

00:03:13.093,00:03:19.566
were building these custom jigs
with gear that they bought at
the hardware store um and though

00:03:19.566,00:03:25.972
is simultaneous burnout and uh
acceleration and it was like
controlled chaos and we've got

00:03:25.972,00:03:30.343
this. And people were exhausted
and then I heard them talking
and they're like yeah but we've

00:03:30.343,00:03:36.950
got stories for a couple of
years and so that was the total
hacker mindset. Uh and in the

00:03:36.950,00:03:40.520
end you got these uh beautiful
badges and later on Lost is
gonna tell you a little bit

00:03:40.520,00:03:45.525
about what's going on uh behind
them but it really was a great
example of us pulling together.

00:03:50.597,00:03:54.801
[applause] You notice my voice
is a little shot um but I'm
gonna get through this with the

00:03:54.801,00:04:00.907
help of some Corona in a minute.
Now another thing you might've
noticed is over the years we

00:04:00.907,00:04:05.545
always kinda screw up and we
forget a department because we
have so many teams. We have over

00:04:05.545,00:04:11.251
300 people helping put on this
show um and that's just the
people we know of. There's a lot

00:04:11.251,00:04:15.689
of people that jump in and fill
gaps and friends of friends that
do things and that's not even

00:04:15.689,00:04:20.760
counting all the contests with
people helping them. Um so
there's hundreds and hundreds of

00:04:20.760,00:04:26.800
people making this event happen
and so I wanna I wanna name all
the departments we have and

00:04:26.800,00:04:30.403
thank them and I'd like you to
give them a round of applause as
well and I'm gonna start off

00:04:30.403,00:04:34.608
with the administration team
[inaudible voice] yep [applause]
If we got the administration

00:04:34.608,00:04:38.411
team just wave your hand.
[applause] Got arts and
entertainment that gave us

00:04:38.411,00:04:43.850
Berlin Information Society. All
the great DJ's. yep. [applause]
[hollering] EVerybody wants to

00:04:43.850,00:04:50.524
join their team now. Uh we have
the artwork team. Mar, Neil, all
the external artists. [applause]

00:04:50.524,00:04:55.529
Badges. [applause] We have all
the contest villages and events
which is a huge team that make

00:04:58.165,00:05:03.103
all of the interaction possible.
[applause] [hollering] Wooh!
[hollering] [inaudible voice]

00:05:07.440,00:05:10.844
[applause] [laughter] Um you
might've noticed last year we
started this demo labs and it

00:05:10.844,00:05:17.017
really grew in popularity so
let's hear it for demo labs
second year. [applause]

00:05:17.017,00:05:23.823
[inaudible voices] Keeping the
keeping everybody uh tied in is
our dispatch and radio team.

00:05:23.823,00:05:28.562
[hollering] [applause] We deploy
over about 100 radios and run.
We have all these FCC licenses.

00:05:28.562,00:05:33.533
We run our own repeaters and
whole information uh network on
our radio network. We've got the

00:05:33.533,00:05:39.105
Defcon groups team. Fronted by
the awkward hug master Jason
Street. [applause] Thank you

00:05:39.105,00:05:45.679
Jason. [applause] He will give
everyone of you a hug later.
[applause] Um we have the forms

00:05:45.679,00:05:49.249
that we use year round. Cot man
is a great administrator of
that. [hollering] [applause]

00:05:49.249,00:05:56.056
We've got the info booth team.
[applause] Trying to help you
get to where you're going.

00:05:56.056,00:06:00.760
[applause] Inhuman registration
for all the people that aren't
human like the cyborgs.

00:06:00.760,00:06:05.765
[applause] We have the uh the
knock the saw and the DCTV team
doing all the infrastructure and

00:06:09.536,00:06:15.508
networking. [applause] They had
a rough time with an in room TV
and it was one thing our

00:06:15.508,00:06:20.480
community is so awesome because
you never have to wonder if
there's a problem. They'll let

00:06:20.480,00:06:26.319
you know. [laughter] Um and so
another interesting thing is
they immediately wanna help. So

00:06:26.319,00:06:30.624
all the sudden 10 people show
up. I think it's the video cable
no it might be the video

00:06:30.624,00:06:35.395
switcher I know I think it's the
encoding well have you checked
the. So we had a lot of help

00:06:35.395,00:06:39.499
trying to figure out what was
going on with the infrastructure
in DCTV. Um and in the end we

00:06:39.499,00:06:46.039
got it working but you know it
worked last year and something
changed. Um we have the press

00:06:46.039,00:06:50.243
team that tries to get attention
to everything that we do and
draw attention to the speakers

00:06:50.243,00:06:53.613
so the rest of the world wants
to come out and check out what
we're doing and try to give an

00:06:53.613,00:06:58.618
accurate portrayal of what it is
that we do. Uh so press team
[applause] We have the onsite

00:07:01.955,00:07:06.059
production team and production
are the people that are making
sure that all the things with

00:07:06.059,00:07:10.864
the hotel are happening. We know
the waters the bars showing up
the projectors are on at the

00:07:10.864,00:07:16.603
right time the televisions are
working in the rooms. We've got
all the contracts and yum

00:07:16.603,00:07:21.508
anyway, production is like a
hand behind the scene making
sure everything is running

00:07:21.508,00:07:27.514
smoothly. [applause] Quarter
Masters major malfunctions team
[applause] >>Wooh! [applause]

00:07:27.514,00:07:34.321
>>I dunno how many tons of gear
but we're up to multiple semi
trailers just for us. Not ee

00:07:34.321,00:07:39.592
including everybody else. I mean
were moving probably 40 tons of
stuff. >>And they're probably

00:07:39.592,00:07:42.862
still moving it right now. >>And
they're moving it right now.
That's maybe why they're not

00:07:42.862,00:07:47.367
here. We have the human
registration team handling that
line for you guys in record

00:07:47.367,00:07:52.372
time. [hollering] [applause]
We've noticed this this trend
where we get better at scaling

00:07:56.743,00:08:01.281
registration. We open it earlier
and we keep increasing the size
and then you guys just keep

00:08:01.281,00:08:06.653
fucking showing up earlier.
[laughter] So at some point
we're gonna have to scale like

00:08:06.653,00:08:11.224
500 stations and we'll do it in
3 minutes or something.
[laughter] I mean that's the

00:08:11.224,00:08:16.229
logical conclusion of where
we're going. >>Use the cloud!
>>Use the cloud. [laughter] >>Ah

00:08:19.299,00:08:27.474
um so for those of you. How many
of you went to ss uh speeches
and how many of you uh enjoyed

00:08:27.474,00:08:36.683
what you saw? [hollering]
[applause] So we get hundreds
and hundreds of submissions

00:08:36.683,00:08:45.091
hundreds probably I dunno Nakita
how many did we get? >>600 plus
>>Over 600 submissions um that

00:08:45.091,00:08:49.229
we had to boil down and because
of this awesome contest behind
us we did away with one of our

00:08:49.229,00:08:54.401
speaking tracks. So we had more
submissions and less space and
that's a really difficult spot

00:08:54.401,00:09:00.440
to be in and luckily we have a
really incredible uh CFP review
team. And you might've seen them

00:09:00.440,00:09:03.643
they had special badges this
year. It's the first year
they've get their own badges

00:09:03.643,00:09:08.915
because it's really important um
that we acknowledge their
commitment and the time they put

00:09:08.915,00:09:14.254
in. And they had one super power
if the you had a review badge
you could cut in line to go to

00:09:14.254,00:09:18.558
see the speeches and that was
it. Because we wanted our
reviewers to be able to see the

00:09:18.558,00:09:23.363
talks and then help provide
feedback after the fact and then
we provide that feedback back to

00:09:23.363,00:09:27.467
the speakers and we're one of
the first conferences. I dunno
if we're the only one where we

00:09:27.467,00:09:33.773
provide all the positive and
negative feedback to all 600
plus submissions. Which is an

00:09:33.773,00:09:38.778
insane amount of work.
[applause] But the speakers are
putting an insane amount of work

00:09:44.451,00:09:49.823
to come here and so we need to
acknowledge um their effort as
well so that's just I think part

00:09:49.823,00:09:54.828
of what we need to do.
[applause] Now it was really
lucky for us this year so the

00:09:59.132,00:10:05.538
sock team you see helping make
uh herd the cats and make
everything happen. Uh CJ leads

00:10:05.538,00:10:11.945
the sock team. This year we had
a record number of attendees. Um
people keep asking you and I'll

00:10:11.945,00:10:17.217
keep asking me and I'll say we
plan for 10 to 12 percent growth
because those were the numbers

00:10:17.217,00:10:21.020
we were getting from BlackHat.
Since we don't do pre
registration we have no idea how

00:10:21.020,00:10:25.425
many people are gonna be here.
But we do know how many people
are buying badges for Defcon at

00:10:25.425,00:10:30.396
BlackHat and we know how big if
BlackHat's growing. So then we
just guess um. [laughter] and

00:10:30.396,00:10:35.935
that's what we base >>And we're
really good at it. >>Ya ya we're
really good. And we have to

00:10:35.935,00:10:42.208
guess like 3 or 4 months in
advance for badges. >>Right.
>>So anyway. We were thinking 12

00:10:42.208,00:10:47.213
or so percent and we grew. We
made 22,000 lanyards and 20,000
badges and we ran out of

00:10:49.849,00:10:54.854
lanyards. So [applause] that was
a huge show for us this year.
and talking to attendees it

00:10:58.658,00:11:03.997
actually didn't feel like a 20
percent growth. It I dunno what
happened but it It felt a lot

00:11:03.997,00:11:10.670
maybe more chill than that. So
ya emergency stanchions worked?
Ya. So anyway let's give a ha

00:11:10.670,00:11:13.940
big round of applause to the
sock for really helping that
happen this year. [yelling]

00:11:13.940,00:11:18.945
[applause] >>Ya CJ's hiding off
to the side here so if you could
raise your hand so everyone can

00:11:21.414,00:11:27.387
give you a virtual hug >>CJ's
over here. >>Wooh! [applause]
>>Thank you guys [applause] >>CJ

00:11:27.387,00:11:33.526
and Tacitus the number 1 number
2 anyway great work this year
from the sock. Social media team

00:11:33.526,00:11:39.199
uh we have uh 3 or 4 people that
help out but it's primarily
fronted by Darrington and Neil.

00:11:39.199,00:11:43.736
Um and then myself when I jump
in. And we're really trying to
stay on top of what people are

00:11:43.736,00:11:47.907
saying in the community and
respond as fast as we can. Um
Cot Man does a lot of uh

00:11:47.907,00:11:53.813
pointing social media stuff in
our direction. Uh so I really
wanna call out social media. Uh

00:11:53.813,00:11:57.917
speaker operations for making
sure the speakers get there on
time and have their first shot

00:11:57.917,00:12:02.855
of whiskey. >>Wooh [applause]
>>Really important [applause]
and finally we're down to our

00:12:06.292,00:12:10.763
vendors shwag team. Trying to
get all the right shwag trying
to sell it as fast as we

00:12:10.763,00:12:15.768
possibly can and again it was a
crazy year for us. We planned on
based on last year how we were

00:12:17.870,00:12:22.875
planning to sell out and what
sizes. Things that were supposed
to sell out on Saturday sold out

00:12:22.875,00:12:27.914
halfway through thursday. We
ordered 2,000 more shirts
overnight and they sold out in 4

00:12:27.914,00:12:34.020
hours the next day. And so it
was just unbelievable the amount
of activity this year. I've just

00:12:34.020,00:12:38.324
never seen anything like it. I
think we had people who were
estimating based on BlackHat

00:12:38.324,00:12:43.896
people from almost 50 countries
here. So it was incredible.
[yelling] [applause] Let's see.

00:12:43.896,00:12:48.901
Is anybody here anybody here not
from Canada or the United States
raise your hand. Look around.

00:12:52.672,00:12:59.345
[yelling] [applause] Wow.
Incredible. [applause] Uh and
finally I'd like to call out the

00:12:59.345,00:13:04.517
workshop team. Workshop started
out last year as kind of an idea
with Nikita uh and we it worked

00:13:04.517,00:13:11.157
out pretty well last year. So
this year we had more space
let's just grow it. And it went

00:13:11.157,00:13:16.462
from kind of a small thing into
something huge that caught us
off guard and overwhelmed us. So

00:13:16.462,00:13:21.434
next year we're gonna be ready
for workshop so I apologize for
any of the problems. Victim of

00:13:21.434,00:13:25.338
our own success. But next year
we're gonna continue workshops
and we're gonna try to manage it

00:13:25.338,00:13:30.343
a lot better. So thank you uh
for the people who endured the
workshops. [yelling] [applause]

00:13:32.812,00:13:37.183
So what we're gonna do now if
we're gonna go to our first
department we give you some

00:13:37.183,00:13:42.722
statistics. The network team is
gonna come up on stage. Uh Louis
if he's around. And we're gonna

00:13:42.722,00:13:47.460
see what just happened on the
supposedly the world's most
dangerous network. Cause I dunno

00:13:47.460,00:13:52.465
if that's true or not. Louis.
[laugher] >>Wooh! [yelling]
>>Thanks Jeff [applause]

00:13:57.603,00:14:01.340
[whistling] Hello Defcon. So I'm
gonna make this quick do we have
a timer? Well you'll boot me off

00:14:01.340,00:14:07.413
if I'm >>[inaudible voice]
>>Okay just do it live. So gonna
talk real quick about the NOC

00:14:07.413,00:14:13.319
this part of the NOC review
slides are readily available on
Defcon networking dot org. So

00:14:13.319,00:14:19.225
let's get to this. For whose
first time Defconners here?
First your first time at Defcon

00:14:19.225,00:14:24.630
>>Wooh! [whistling] >>Okay
[applause] so a whole bunch of
people. So incase you don't know

00:14:24.630,00:14:29.068
we do pretty much all the
networking for everything that
makes this work in a convention

00:14:29.068,00:14:34.073
space. Uh all the wired stuff is
there. DCTV we're gonna talk
more about DCTV on the issues

00:14:36.476,00:14:42.648
that we had real quick and
wireless. One new thing for
wireless this year is that open

00:14:42.648,00:14:49.455
CTF played through one of the
SSIDs that we had and they got
double of the amount of

00:14:49.455,00:14:55.194
attendees of participants they
had so I think it helped out a
lot. Uh we have a 10 gig

00:14:55.194,00:15:00.133
backbone. And we started with
our basic 1, 25 uh 125 megabits
per second uplink and then we

00:15:04.470,00:15:10.343
maxed it out. Thanks to the new
people that showed up and then
we bumped that up to 175. That

00:15:10.343,00:15:15.348
didn't work. 200 was thanks Jeff
thanks Cheryl um and that kind
of helped it helped a lot with

00:15:18.484,00:15:24.457
several things. >>[inaudible
voice] >>What is it? >>Your
Android mobile phone >>Oh ya.

00:15:24.457,00:15:31.297
I'll get that into the issues
that were resolved. [laughing]
Uh they wired so everybody asked

00:15:31.297,00:15:38.237
what we used for gear so you can
go through this. Through the
slides. Um in DCTV we have 5

00:15:38.237,00:15:43.242
channels on each on both both of
the the hotels. Uh 5 Raspberry
Pi's for each. And uh video

00:15:46.779,00:15:52.318
transcoding provided by Sou
Source of Knowledge. And uh
there's a video in the knock

00:15:52.318,00:15:56.289
that partially solved the
problem and then I'm. There a
couple more things that actually

00:15:56.289,00:16:01.227
helped solve the problem. So
DCTV we switched this year ya we
made changes right? To try to

00:16:03.396,00:16:08.401
make it better. So DCTV we
turned HD uh for the broadcast.
Which made it look good.

00:16:11.070,00:16:16.242
[applause] When it worked.
[applause] And it worked for
most of the time. When we tested

00:16:16.242,00:16:22.148
before you guys got here and
hogged our our internet link it
worked really well. But um again

00:16:22.148,00:16:28.988
we'll do it live right? And one
thing new that we did in regards
to DCTV is the internet streams.

00:16:28.988,00:16:33.993
So we streamed CGC, DC101 and
this is being broadcast live to
the internet for the first time.

00:16:36.495,00:16:41.500
Thanks Jeff. [applause] >>Wooh!
[applause] >>So this is kind of
the timeline. One of the changes

00:16:45.137,00:16:51.878
that we had last year uh was to
have because of the thing behind
me here. The shiny things. The

00:16:51.878,00:16:58.551
awesome things here. They we had
to show up a few a day early
basically. Ta 2 uh Mac and

00:16:58.551,00:17:02.755
videoman they show up they
showed up one day early. And
being here one day early really

00:17:02.755,00:17:07.360
helped a lot so usually we start
working on Monday, this year we
had the internet running on

00:17:07.360,00:17:12.365
Sunday so on Monday we could hit
the ground and get things
working. And Thursday was kind

00:17:15.468,00:17:21.374
of a hold off day for us. What
was ready was ready what wasn't
ready we couldn't do much. And

00:17:21.374,00:17:27.480
Friday 6 a m that's when we had
this room this big room here.
That's when we put everything

00:17:27.480,00:17:32.485
together so thanks for the for
the team for for waking up very
early for doing this. [laughter]

00:17:34.487,00:17:41.193
And Saturday we worked through
the DCTV issues along with
Friday and I'm gonna cover that

00:17:41.193,00:17:47.033
on the next slide and we leave
tomorrow hopefully. Can't stay
here anymore. The issues.

00:17:47.033,00:17:52.405
Bandwidth. Things were more of
you using the network and
trusting somehow the network

00:17:52.405,00:17:58.644
with your with your mobile
devices or your burners what
have you. So we had way more

00:17:58.644,00:18:05.351
users than we had in the past.
And we had some AP coverage some
spotty uh locations and we

00:18:05.351,00:18:10.856
worked through that. And DCTV
started with the bandwidth uh we
were doing some some of the

00:18:10.856,00:18:16.162
stuff we were doing uh on the
internet and traffic had to go
back. So then we switched to

00:18:16.162,00:18:20.366
have a local server here that
helped a lot and we thought it
was gonna solve the problems but

00:18:20.366,00:18:25.771
then we ran into other things.
So what we did we turned down
the resolution and then we also

00:18:25.771,00:18:30.776
switched from RTSP to RTMP and
that have seem to resolve most
of the problems. And this is

00:18:34.380,00:18:39.919
everything else I'm gonna just
walk just run by but this is
what usually people like to see.

00:18:39.919,00:18:46.158
You guys transfers transferred 4
point 3 terabytes of data
throughout the 4 or 5 days.

00:18:46.158,00:18:51.163
That's more than double the last
year. And we had about 10,000 uh
35,000 unique DHCP leases.

00:18:53.966,00:19:00.039
Doesn't mean much 'cause you can
fake Mac addresses and all that
stuff but the numbers are there

00:19:00.039,00:19:05.711
and you we transferred a whole
bunch of data. So thanks for
using the network. [applause]

00:19:05.711,00:19:10.716
These are the top 10 wireless
chip sets used. You can go
through this again later. And

00:19:13.152,00:19:19.158
this is the team shout out for
the for the awesome NOC team
here I'm Efffn I run this um

00:19:19.158,00:19:24.163
Matt is my number 2 but he does
most of the work actually. Um I
do a lot of the planning. Uh

00:19:27.166,00:19:32.838
there's the old guys here

NIce to meet you sir um so I"m
the department leader for

00:21:50.609,00:21:55.781
contests, events, villages,
parties, and the demo labs. So
pretty much the content that

00:21:55.781,00:22:01.086
isn't review board selected or
the workshops that is our
department. I do that with

00:22:01.086,00:22:06.091
Panadero um and a whole team of
other goons. Uh there are 20 of
us total who are managing

00:22:10.396,00:22:16.735
135,000 square feet of Defcon so
quite a bit. So if uh if you
enjoyed doing things that

00:22:16.735,00:22:21.740
weren't sitting in talks you
know stick with our mantra. Not
one talk, not ever. So [yelling]

00:22:28.047,00:22:33.052
[applause] Um [applause] So
[inaudible voice] ya there are
no talks at Defcon. I [applause]

00:22:33.052,00:22:39.892
>>Defcon was canceled. We're not
sure why you're here.
>>[laughter] Um but legitimately

00:22:39.892,00:22:44.897
like we um we we have an insane
amount of content and eh I just
wanted to give a huge huge

00:22:46.899,00:22:51.937
thanks to all of the contest
organizers. You can see this
insane number of contests that

00:22:51.937,00:22:58.811
are up there. They spend um
dozens of hours dozens no more
like hundreds of hours on some

00:22:58.811,00:23:04.884
of these contests. Uh a
significant amount of money in
some cases and they really

00:23:04.884,00:23:11.090
really pour their hearts into
it. So um we love em I mean
honestly. If you guys are

00:23:11.090,00:23:15.461
interested in putting on a
contest we're always looking for
new stuff. Please hit me up at

00:23:15.461,00:23:20.466
grifter at Defcon dot org and uh
and we'll we'll get it done. Not
like tomorrow like relax. Um

00:23:23.369,00:23:30.042
probably like January. I'll I'll
finally wake up then. Villages.
How many people hungout in a

00:23:30.042,00:23:35.047
village? [hollering] [applause]
So uh so the villages I I wanna
give a little credit here. So

00:23:38.617,00:23:44.356
the villages were actually born
at the Riv at Defcon 14. Um we
said hey we have these sky boxes

00:23:44.356,00:23:48.294
we need something to do with
them. If you provide content for
it we'll let you like just chill

00:23:48.294,00:23:51.630
in em and hang out in em at
night and maybe throw a party
and do whatever. And so the

00:23:51.630,00:23:57.970
first village was created by a
tool. It's the lockpick village.
So you I think ya uh shouten

00:23:57.970,00:24:02.374
shout out to tool. [applause] Um
they came and said hey we wanna
do this thing we'll have talks,

00:24:02.374,00:24:07.146
we'll set up tables, we'll teach
people, we'll do all this stuff.
And that has become a hacker con

00:24:07.146,00:24:12.151
standard. So again. Thank you
Tool it's awesome. Now at Defcon
we have 10. You can see em all

00:24:15.087,00:24:19.658
there. Again not gonna read em
all. There they are. Um but
everybody um who got to hangout

00:24:19.658,00:24:24.663
in the village it's they're
fantastic. We love you guys uh
keep at it. Events. So you know

00:24:27.232,00:24:31.403
things like the shoot or um
drone club. Drone club's
awesome. They're newer. They

00:24:31.403,00:24:35.374
were here last year. We kinda
had em tucked a little bit in a
corner. This year we put em up

00:24:35.374,00:24:38.977
on the 26th floor and they were
like flying drones at each other
and like it was like pop the

00:24:38.977,00:24:43.482
balloon and get past the phantom
and they had little drones
attacking larger drones. It was

00:24:43.482,00:24:49.655
awesome. Um then we have our ya
know our our events that are all
that always come back. Things

00:24:49.655,00:24:55.227
like Mohawk Con and and Hacker
Karaoke things that are Defcon
staples and so you know thank

00:24:55.227,00:25:00.399
you again to all these events
that provide something for us to
do um when we're stumbling

00:25:00.399,00:25:05.404
around the hallways or ya know
it's 2 in the morning and you're
just trying to never sleep. Lost

00:25:07.906,00:25:12.911
your up. >>Wooh! >>ya! [yelling]
[applause] >>It's weird being up
on stage for the opening and

00:25:23.789,00:25:28.794
then the closing I feel like a
bookend. [laughter] Welcome to
uh to the closing ceremonies and

00:25:31.997,00:25:34.933
thank you for all the kind
words. >>There's a joke there
somewhere [laughter] >>It was

00:25:34.933,00:25:39.238
funny to me that's all that
matters right? [laughter] So's
uh some of you may have noticed

00:25:39.238,00:25:45.110
the a the wonderful badges that
uh that Jeff and I are are are
currently wearing and that uh

00:25:45.110,00:25:50.382
the winners of the uh Uber Badge
will be receiving. Um it would
be a miss if we didn't call out

00:25:50.382,00:25:56.088
a few people who had a a hand in
this who are really the only
hands in this and uh Rick

00:25:56.088,00:26:01.026
Gallesin if you could stand up.
[applause] [yelling] [applause]
For those of you who don't know

00:26:07.332,00:26:12.638
uh Rick is a professional uh
special effects artist in
Hollywood and you may have seen

00:26:12.638,00:26:17.142
his work. Correct me if I'm
wrong the mechanism that drives
these is the same mechanism that

00:26:17.142,00:26:21.914
was in the dinosaurs in Jurassic
Park for the spitters. Is that
correct? >>[inaudible voice]

00:26:21.914,00:26:26.185
>>The tongue so he's done
dinosaurs in Jurassic Park, he's
done Teenage Mutant Ninja

00:26:26.185,00:26:32.391
Turtles um he's top notch and
these badges would not have
happened without him. Um I had

00:26:32.391,00:26:37.262
some crazy ideas but the
execution is was Rick. And in a
addition to that we had John

00:26:37.262,00:26:42.267
McFalin. John can you stand up?
[yelling] [applause] Some of you
may recognize John he was our he

00:26:46.505,00:26:50.943
our our actor that we embedded
in the in the crowd to do dead
drops the year that we had a

00:26:50.943,00:26:55.714
secret agent but it's part of
the game. Um but if one more
time can we just give a hand to

00:26:55.714,00:27:00.652
everybody that was involved. Oh
and and his son Justin also. Uh
Justin stand up he helped with

00:27:03.455,00:27:08.460
the assembly. [applause] So uh
this is probably the most
complex badge that that we've

00:27:12.064,00:27:18.937
ever done for an Uber. Um many
of you have seen that we've had
forgeries of the thee

00:27:18.937,00:27:23.775
radioactive badges with the
nuclear isotopes. Uh which I
loved by the way and I loved

00:27:23.775,00:27:28.514
that I had multiples and my
favorite and I'm sorry to the
guys that put all the work in.

00:27:28.514,00:27:32.751
My favorite has to be the guy
that brought one that was half
as big as it needed to be

00:27:32.751,00:27:37.923
because all he had to work with
was a picture and he had no
scale so. [laughter] I just I

00:27:37.923,00:27:42.928
think that's phenomenal so give
that guy a hand. [applause]
[yelling] So uh for for what

00:27:47.666,00:27:53.539
we've been waiting for the
council of 9 who are the winners
of this year's badge contest.

00:27:53.539,00:27:58.544
Could you come up here please
guys give a hand. [applause] For
those unaware this is probably

00:28:07.019,00:28:11.823
one of the most grueling
competitions at Defcon. When you
have CTF or you have a single

00:28:11.823,00:28:17.329
focus um it's pretty easy if you
know what your objective is. In
the badge contest much like the

00:28:17.329,00:28:21.767
mystery challenge. They don't
even know what they have to do
half the time. So a lot of the

00:28:21.767,00:28:26.505
challenge is like hacking out on
the internet where you've got a
signal and noise and you have to

00:28:26.505,00:28:31.677
figure out what's important and
what isn't. And these guys uh
start working on the competition

00:28:31.677,00:28:37.149
actually before Defcon, even
when it's not supposed to be
running. [laughter] And I do

00:28:37.149,00:28:41.787
apologize for the crawn jobs
that may be changing my page
sizes so that you guys can't uh

00:28:41.787,00:28:46.024
tell when I change things. I
wanna give a a at least one of
you what 30 seconds Jeff or

00:28:46.024,00:28:49.227
something like that to say
[inaudible voice] So can we have
one somebody from the team come

00:28:49.227,00:28:55.534
up and talk about your
experience. >>Sure sure. Um we
actually wanted to take this 30

00:28:55.534,00:29:01.640
seconds to really thank Lost and
his team for all that they do
for Defcon and that it's largely

00:29:01.640,00:29:06.244
through their efforts that the
hacker spirit is still alive at
Defcon and that's what we really

00:29:06.244,00:29:11.249
wanted to say. We wanted to
thank you. [applause] [inaudible
voices] [applause] >>So so with

00:29:16.221,00:29:21.960
the exception of the CTF guys um
due to the complexity of these.
We're actually gonna ship them

00:29:21.960,00:29:28.300
to the winner's registered mail.
Um that's why you don't see them
walking off the stage with their

00:29:28.300,00:29:33.472
badges for those of you duh
don't know these take well over
10 hours to just assemble uh a

00:29:33.472,00:29:39.911
single badge and every part in
these is is custom designed. So
we thought it was worth it

00:29:39.911,00:29:44.683
because we have to hand tune
every one of em and with the
traveling here, we didn't have

00:29:44.683,00:29:49.688
the resources to get all of them
tuned in time because there are
rel really only person, Rick,

00:29:52.290,00:29:56.695
who can do that hand tuning and
we wanna give them something
that this is on par this is like

00:29:56.695,00:30:01.333
taking home a movie prop from
Hollywood so anyway >>Have you
showed them what it does? >>They

00:30:01.333,00:30:06.338
can do that. So for those of you
who haven't seen it. So we'll
cycle through. I dunno if you

device. Not that exact one but
similar. [laughter] Some uh
smart locks, routers,

00:34:42.480,00:34:48.219
thermostats, and even a
wheelchair. Not sure if you saw
the personless wheelchair flying

00:34:48.219,00:34:52.891
around the halls but that was
being remotely controlled
through a hack. So that was

00:34:52.891,00:34:58.229
pretty awesome. We're gonna be

were found and determining what

other groups. We really

appreciate the support we get
every year. We fill the room
thanks to you guys. Um we try

and bring out this new thing.
It's It's kind of neat, it's
called wireless. [laughter] um I

00:43:53.498,00:43:58.436
think you guys call it IOT and
some other things nowadays but
it's still all insecure wireless

00:43:58.436,00:44:03.641
so we play with it quite a bit.
Um we had over 100 challenges
this year thanks to a whole

00:44:03.641,00:44:09.580
lotta creative folks who've been
working all year on this. We had
a fully running uh um scada

00:44:09.580,00:44:13.885
system that was attacked by
wireless and then you could run
through an entire control

00:44:13.885,00:44:20.224
system. Um we had 32 teams of 63
people that scored. Those aren't
the people that were actually in

00:44:20.224,00:44:24.495
the room playing, those are the
people that actually scored. The
winning team was able to find

00:44:24.495,00:44:29.500
fox and a hound over 72 megahert
wireless or um sorry 72 megahert
um signal. They found a fox with

00:44:32.537,00:44:38.843
bluetooth low energy and 3
different 2 point 4 gigahertz
foxes. Uh we had almost 100

00:44:38.843,00:44:43.514
percent uptime with our network.
Um we saw when Defcon went down
and we went down with them but

00:44:43.514,00:44:49.253
other than that we we ran really

[yelling] >>ya boners!
[laughter] [applause] >>Uh first
off I wanna thank my team. Uh

00:45:21.919,00:45:26.657
they were great. Uh without them
we wouldn't be here. Uh I also
wanna thank the guys, the

00:45:26.657,00:45:31.996
wireless village, they put some
amazing puzzles out there for us
to solve. >>Aw we love you too

00:45:31.996,00:45:35.499
>>We love you too [kissing]
>>And figure out. Everytime we
we every time we do the contest

00:45:35.499,00:45:40.004
we learn something new. They
always like to throw a curveball
at us. Uh I also wanna thank our

00:45:40.004,00:45:43.941
families for letting us come to
Vegas and ya know have some time
away from the family and the

00:45:43.941,00:45:49.614
kids and and everything. Uh and
I wanna ya know thank the the
community at large for having

00:45:49.614,00:45:54.619
such an awesome conference.
[applause] [yelling] [applause]
[inaudible voices] >>That's a

00:46:03.394,00:46:08.399
bold move Cotton. [laughter] Uh
so. [laughter] Uh next up is
gonna be the guys that who did

00:46:11.902,00:46:16.774
the car hacking village CTF if
you guys. Who went into the car
hacking village? [yelling]

00:46:16.774,00:46:20.444
[applause] Thats ri- it was
awesome right? [laughter] I'll
let them tell you uh what went

00:46:20.444,00:46:26.784
into the CTF. It's pretty pretty
bad ass. >>Hello I'm Robert. I'm
with Kambos Hack and I'd like to

00:46:26.784,00:46:32.356
thank everybody who showed up to
the car hacking village and got
our got your badge. Um this year

00:46:32.356,00:46:37.628
was our first year trying to do
a conferan a contest. So this
year we were asked if we could

00:46:37.628,00:46:43.567
do a CTF and I'm gonna pass it
over to Eric and let him talk a
little about the CTS TC TF.

00:46:43.567,00:46:50.508
Thanks. >>So it's our honor to
present the winners of the very
first car hacking village

00:46:50.508,00:46:55.846
capture the fag flag contest.
Wow that was almost bad.
[laughter] We were really blown

00:46:55.846,00:47:01.786
away by the level of
participation and uh competition
in the contest. We had 60 people

00:47:01.786,00:47:06.223
registered and those
leaderboards were back and forth
all weekend long. So all those

00:47:06.223,00:47:09.960
nightmares we had of throwing a
CTF and not having anybody
showed up turned out to be

00:47:09.960,00:47:14.765
unfounded but anyway. Ultimately
at the end of the day first and
second place were decided by

00:47:14.765,00:47:20.171
thir uh 60 second submission
windows so speed is really of
the essence. So thanks again to

00:47:20.171,00:47:24.709
Robert for hosting us and
everybody who came down to see
us. We really enjoyed it and we

00:47:24.709,00:47:29.380
hope you did too and now without
further ado, the winners. >>Show
us your badge >>Oh the the car

00:47:29.380,00:47:33.951
hacking badge. Unfortunately the
battery's dead right now so.
>>It plugs into the camp bus?

00:47:33.951,00:47:38.956
>>It ca plugs into the camp bus
yup. [inaudible voices] and and
maybe [laughs] >> You use the

00:47:42.259,00:47:48.699
steering wheel to steal the car
[laughter] pretty cool >>Cool so
my name is Jason, I'm from bug

00:47:48.699,00:47:53.037
crowd and uh we sponsored and
ran operations as well as
conserred contributed

00:47:53.037,00:47:58.209
challenges. Uh a couple people I
wanna thank before we get to the
winners uh Bug Crowd, FCA, the

00:47:58.209,00:48:04.415
car hackers, the village, and uh
CTFD which was the platform we
ran the CTF on. Um and Dan for

00:48:04.415,00:48:09.754
doing all the operations he's
awesome. Um so uh without
further ado we had 3 winners fir

00:48:09.754,00:48:15.893
uh third place is Acid Fingers,
right here. [applause]
[whooping] Um absolutely took

00:48:15.893,00:48:20.164
the lead early on uh we thought
he was gonna blow through
everything but just kinda lost

00:48:20.164,00:48:25.035
out a little bit uh and then we
had Ramrod and MK. 60 minute
submission window which was

00:48:25.035,00:48:31.609
crazy um so Ramrod came in
second. Not here right now and
MK these 2 right here, um never

00:48:31.609,00:48:36.947
had a lot of car hacking
experience before so really
awesome. It really says

00:48:36.947,00:48:40.918
something about what we wanna
do. We wanna get people into the
car hacking world and these 2

00:48:40.918,00:48:44.722
were new at it and they killed
it and i'm so proud of everyone
involved with this and I thank

00:48:44.722,00:48:49.627
Defcon. Uh we got some prizes we
got a drone for firs er robot
for first place. It's a 500

00:48:49.627,00:48:55.366
dollar Alpha Robot. Uh and the
second and third place prizes uh
are drones. The uh Discovery

00:48:55.366,00:48:59.904
Drones here. Uh we'll ship this
one to the winner. And then a
black badge so uh

00:48:59.904,00:49:04.842
congratulations to everyone.
Thank you Defcon, and Jeff and
everybody. Thank you! [applause]

00:49:12.249,00:49:17.788
>>So this year, we were really
proud to host or provide the
space for the first ever cyber

00:49:17.788,00:49:23.627
grand challenge and so in our
second to last black badge uh
contest we would like call up

00:49:23.627,00:49:29.867
the uh CGC folks and hear a
little bit about what just
happened and why it took 55

00:49:29.867,00:49:34.071
million dollars to essentially
assemble and execute the
contest. That uh the machines

00:49:34.071,00:49:39.076
that are behind us so I'd like
to bring up Mr. Walker. Thank
you so much. [inaudible voices]

00:49:43.247,00:49:49.320
[applause] >>Hello Defcon. My
name's Mike Walker I'm here with
DARPA um and thursday august 4th

00:49:49.320,00:49:55.593
2016 is finally behind us. That
date has been years in front of
me for so long and I can't tell

00:49:55.593,00:50:00.631
you about the hundreds of people
who worked with us uh so that we
could have the first all machine

00:50:00.631,00:50:05.169
hacking tournament execute here
co-located with Defcon and it
and it worked. So uh [whooping]

00:50:05.169,00:50:07.171
so uh uh yesterday Defcon asked
if we could uh fi we could talk
about it uh today at closing

00:50:07.171,00:50:09.173
ceremonies so I I sat up in my
hotel room and uh I wrote down
some thoughts on on what this

00:50:09.173,00:50:15.012
all means. So I wanna tell you
about a battle between
adversarial thinking machines

00:50:15.012,00:50:20.017
held in the heat of August. The
scene is the the New York
Hilton, the day is August 34th

00:50:31.128,00:50:36.734
uh August 31st and the year is
1970 and the battle is the first
United States computer chess

00:50:36.734,00:50:42.273
championship held by the ACM. So
the idea they've computers that
could play expert games was just

00:50:42.273,00:50:47.778
beginning then. These primitive
machines duked it out for days.
A champion emerged named Chess 3

00:50:47.778,00:50:54.151
point 0 written in 4 tran 4. Uh
so 46 years later things are
different, some things stay the

00:50:54.151,00:50:59.757
same. Computers are playing much
harder games now. Uh these
machines behind me, they can

00:50:59.757,00:51:05.829
play capture the flag. They can
wrestle through pass uh through
software sometimes infinite pass

00:51:05.829,00:51:11.735
even simple software can can
process an infinite number of
inputs. This is a not a a big

00:51:11.735,00:51:16.707
board, it's something beyond
that. Um head to head network
securities a game of incomplete

00:51:16.707,00:51:21.612
information. It's multi opponent
deals with past search problems
that are provably impossible in

00:51:21.612,00:51:26.617
the general case and yet these
systems work. They are limited
first generation prototypes and

00:51:29.219,00:51:33.991
some day somebody else is gonna
call them primitive. I will
always remember them as the

00:51:33.991,00:51:39.430
first of their kind and as
powerful as this capability is
here's what i think history has

00:51:39.430,00:51:44.735
taught us about things that
aren't gonna change. First I
wanna talk about the 4th place

00:51:44.735,00:51:50.541
machine at that first all
computer chess tournament. It
was built by a man named Hans

00:51:50.541,00:51:56.380
Berliner and Hans kept working
on automating games. He built a
backgammon game uh system named

00:51:56.380,00:52:01.318
BKG 9 point 8, pioneered the use
of fuzzy fuzzy logic in gaming
software and in 1979 Hans

00:52:03.487,00:52:08.392
watched as his creation became
the first computer program to
beat a human world champion in

00:52:08.392,00:52:15.132
any game. Hans was a pioneer and
despite not ending up on the
podium in 1970, he went on to

00:52:15.132,00:52:20.671
change the world in his own
right. I believe that when a
challenge is used to pioneer new

00:52:20.671,00:52:26.176
technology, it's sometimes just
as important to look to the
people as it is to look at the

00:52:26.176,00:52:32.716
places and I really look forward
wha to seeing what happens with
the community that that built

00:52:32.716,00:52:37.087
this game, that played in it,
and what they build in the
future. I think that's the most

00:52:37.087,00:52:43.727
important thing that happened
here. So second, I wanna talk
about the story of chess and and

00:52:43.727,00:52:48.732
we all know this story right? Uh
first people were grand masters
and then an AI named Deep Blue 2

00:52:50.734,00:52:57.674
defeated the world chess
champion and people were demoted
to second place. Um but today if

00:52:57.674,00:53:03.447
you defeat a grandmaster at
chess there's an app for that.
Um I I I wonder how many of you

00:53:03.447,00:53:08.619
know the rest of the story
because that story isn't over.
Uh it turns out that chess is

00:53:08.619,00:53:13.190
played at it's highest level
today not by machines or by
people but by people and

00:53:13.190,00:53:19.563
machines working together and
they call it cintar chess and
it's still going on in 2016.

00:53:19.563,00:53:25.302
And and that's I I hope what you
come away with from this today.
What could automation and people

00:53:25.302,00:53:29.707
do together? As partners, I
think we could do something that
neither one of us can do on our

00:53:29.707,00:53:35.512
own. The idea's congruent with
all the evidence we have. Expert
systems, first gen AI, whatever

00:53:35.512,00:53:40.584
you wanna call it. They're fast,
they're scaleable, they're
powerful, they're brittle,

00:53:40.584,00:53:45.222
they're fundamentally limited,
and they're incapable of
innovation but when they partner

00:53:45.222,00:53:50.828
with us the combination could be
amazing. And I wanna read you a
passage that I've become fond

00:53:50.828,00:53:56.934
of. The hope is that in not too
many years human brains and
computing machines will be

00:53:56.934,00:54:01.071
coupled together very tightly
and that the resulting
partnership will think as no

00:54:01.071,00:54:06.477
human brain has ever thought and
process data in a way not
approached by the information

00:54:06.477,00:54:11.482
handling machines that we know
today. So that was written by
JCR Licklider in March of 1960

00:54:13.650,00:54:18.655
and 2 years later, he went on to
run the DARPA office that I work
for today. So with that I wanna

00:54:21.592,00:54:26.530
play you some highlights from
our competition on thursday and
introduce to you some of the

00:54:26.530,00:54:31.535
teams um [inaudible voice] that
that won. And I'm gonna go
search for videos. [inaudible

00:54:36.607,00:54:41.612
voices] and Russ is gonna help.
[laughter] [inaudible voices] So
this is uh the for all secure

00:54:56.360,00:55:00.097
system Mayhem and we're gonna
bring for for all secure up
here. Uh and you're gonna see

00:55:00.097,00:55:06.470
what a cyber reasoning system
looks like. So this is uh Mayhem
producing uh an input uh that

00:55:06.470,00:55:12.576
found a bug in a service that
replicated MSO8O67 very famous
flaw. Uh now we have learned

00:55:12.576,00:55:18.749
since Thursday, that the bug it
found in this software uh is
actually an unintended bug that

00:55:18.749,00:55:24.121
we didn't even know about. It
was a different complex heap
bug. Uh which is pretty cool ya

00:55:24.121,00:55:29.126
know for a bot. [laughter] Sorry
excuse me cyber reasoning
system. Here it is um so

00:55:33.897,00:55:37.234
congratulations to Mayhem.
Mayhem is our first place
winner. They take to home 2

00:55:37.234,00:55:42.239
million dollars. Well done
gentlemen. [applause] The second
system is Zandra built by Tech

00:55:53.150,00:55:57.321
X. Um this is our second place
team they are taking home 1
million dollars. Come up on

00:55:57.321,00:56:04.061
stage everybody. Um and what
you're seeing is 2 traces here.
One in our patched binary, one

00:56:04.061,00:56:10.100
in in our vulnerable binary and
the Zandra system found
something that it could uh that

00:56:10.100,00:56:14.271
it could capture flags against
both. It found an unintended bug
that we didn't even know about

00:56:14.271,00:56:20.410
in a service called OTP sim uh
all on it's own. Congratulations
to Tech X second place winners.

00:56:20.410,00:56:25.415
[applause] And I I have to say
something before I bring our
third place team up because on

00:56:32.155,00:56:37.794
Thursday night, uh we we uh
started verifying scoring and we
were unable to verify third

00:56:37.794,00:56:43.767
place until late last night and
uh we were actually able to
notify our third place team this

00:56:43.767,00:56:48.605
morning that they won third
place and that means that they
have not yet had the opportunity

00:56:48.605,00:56:53.543
to come up in front of a crowd
as the official third place
winner of cyber grand challenge.

00:56:53.543,00:56:58.815
So I I actually have one more
request uh for this community
and that is can can you please

00:56:58.815,00:57:03.754
make this room shake for
Shellfish. [whooping] [applause]
So this is an an input into

00:57:19.436,00:57:24.508
previously unknown code created
by the mechanical fish system
right back there built by

00:57:24.508,00:57:30.280
Shellfish behind me uh and it's
traversing an input into a
famous bug and send mail from

00:57:30.280,00:57:35.619
2005 called crack adder. Only
it's a new version of crack
adder that was rebuilt but uh

00:57:35.619,00:57:41.425
but still pretty cool. Um and I
think Halver is gonna post on it
when he lands uh he's reading it

00:57:41.425,00:57:47.798
on the airplane. So uh in
closing I wanna say thank you to
this community uh for for for

00:57:47.798,00:57:51.601
letting us find common ground
with you and build this uh
contest here. Thank you to

00:57:51.601,00:57:55.906
everyone who participated. Thank
you to the hundreds of team uh
people who helped build this

00:57:55.906,00:58:00.844
liquid cool data center in here
and all the software inside it.
Thank you so much. [applause]

00:58:03.180,00:58:08.185
>>So so what we're trying to do
here in a surprise move um this
has never happened before but

00:58:11.922,00:58:16.927
we're granting the winning
machine Mayhem a black badge.
[whooping] [laughing] [applause]

00:58:19.496,00:58:25.168
Not the team, the machine.
[applause] Um and we're just
wondering what the machine would

00:58:25.168,00:58:30.974
have to say about this if it had
a cha ability to speak. Sort of
like Colossus. But um in lieu of

00:58:30.974,00:58:35.379
the machine, the closest person
that might know what's going on
in the mind of the machine. I

00:58:35.379,00:58:39.783
would love to see if somebody
from team Mayhem has a couple of
words to say of what it's like

00:58:39.783,00:58:45.021
to have their creation uh win
the highest honor that we can
bestow here at Defcon. Now it's

00:58:45.021,00:58:51.361
a lifetime uh admittance to
Defcon but we don't expect to
see a super computer showing up

00:58:51.361,00:58:56.366
every year. Um but it is going
in uh the I understand the
Smithsonian Museum. So it'd be

00:58:58.802,00:59:03.039
really cool to see one of the
robotic rise of the machines
badges in the muse uh

00:59:03.039,00:59:08.044
Smithsonian. Uh we're see if we
can get somebody up here.
[inaudible voice] Tyler

00:59:10.280,00:59:12.749
[inaudible voices] And you don't
even have to speak like a
computer you can speak like a

00:59:12.749,00:59:17.754
human. [inaudible voices] >>Uh
well, I'm not the computer of
course. That was someone else.

00:59:21.758,00:59:28.064
Um but thank you to to DARPA for
for organizing the cyber grand
challenge and uh letting our

00:59:28.064,00:59:33.970
team For All Secure participate.
It's been an incredible 2 year
journey to this. Um and thank

00:59:33.970,00:59:39.609
you to DT and everyone at Defcon
for for allowing uh this to
happen at Defcon because we'd be

00:59:39.609,00:59:44.614
here anyway every year so we're
glad we didn't have to do 2
things. Um ya and thank you

00:59:48.318,00:59:53.323
everyone um ya. [inaudible
voices] [laughter] [applause]
Dont kill all humans that's bad.

00:59:58.328,01:00:03.333
[applause] >>Alright. Gotta get
back to the slides here.
[inaudible voices] I got it.

01:00:13.143,01:00:18.148
[inaudible voices] >>What did
you do Grifter? >>I did nothing
i'm getting it. >>It's good it's

01:00:24.588,01:00:28.191
good. >>What you you my tech
support? >>He he told me to get
up here and fix it for you. >>Oh

01:00:28.191,01:00:33.129
that's cool [laughter] just stay
up here with me >>Just like I

01:00:33.129,01:00:38.468

good man, wise and true. Uh so
the next contest uh doesn't

01:00:38.468,01:00:44.374
really need an introduction but
I just wanna say from a um from
an organizer stand point from a

01:00:44.374,01:00:50.547
a goon standpoint uh this this
contest brings a lot of energy
and a lot of excitement to our

01:00:50.547,01:00:56.920
area so uh the music is going,
there's always like crowds
around uh the folks at the

having them there with us that

01:01:03.460,01:01:09.332
the last 5 minutes when the
final countdown starts is super
high energy and uh like I said I

01:01:09.332,01:01:14.337
mean they're just the best.
Capture the flag. [applause]
>>Good evening I'm Vito at

01:01:21.611,01:01:27.117
Legitimate Business Syndicate.
One year ago we announced the
platform for Defcon capture the

01:01:27.117,01:01:32.856
flag would be the DARPA decree
system. As of this weekend, we
are pleased to announce the

01:01:32.856,01:01:38.194
successful completion of the
first human versus computer
reverse engineering and

01:01:38.194,01:01:43.767
exploitation capture the flag.
We would like to thank all of
our competitors for playing with

01:01:43.767,01:01:50.607
honor skill and forgiveness for
our operational issues at the
game start. We give huge thanks

01:01:50.607,01:01:56.179
to Defcon goons for keeping our
room focused and friendly, to
the cyber grand challenge winner

01:01:56.179,01:02:02.419
Mayhem for being willing to put
their computer against the most
ruthless human hackers in the

01:02:02.419,01:02:07.290
world and to the capture the
flag community world wide for
being part of this historic

01:02:07.290,01:02:12.295
event. [whooping] [applause]
>>Hi everybody I'm Gunna Phase
with the Legitimate Business

01:02:17.167,01:02:22.339
Syndicate. I'd once again like
to thank everyone involved for
their grace and patience when

01:02:22.339,01:02:27.611
dealing with our issues. I would
also like to thank the giants on
the stage with me. Without their

01:02:27.611,01:02:32.616
shoulders to stand on, this game
could not happen. [applause] >>2
years ago DARPA presented a

01:02:38.555,01:02:43.293
challenge that many people in
this room scoffed at. Build a
computer that could compete with

01:02:43.293,01:02:50.233
the best hackers in the world.
I"m proud to announce that they
have succeeded. At many points

01:02:50.233,01:02:56.172
this weekend an autonomous syst
computer system was beating some
our teams. The raw scores for

01:02:56.172,01:03:00.877
all the teams will be available
in the coming weeks. As well as
the exploits, patches, and fire

01:03:00.877,01:03:05.882
all rules that all of our teams
created. I am now proud to
announce the top t- 3 teams of

01:03:08.785,01:03:13.790
our capture the flag. In third
place we had Deathcore, last
years champions from Korea.

01:03:18.061,01:03:23.066
[applause] In second place, we
had Bloops. A combination of
Blue Lotus and Oops. [applause]

01:03:30.507,01:03:35.512
And finally, I am proud to
present th to the Pretty Potent
Poners of the Plaid Parliament

01:03:43.453,01:03:48.458
of Poning. The first place prize
8 black badges. [whooping]
[applause] Come up PPP

01:04:07.177,01:04:10.747
[inaudible yelling and talking]
>>So the winners of the CTF get
these hand crafted black badges

01:04:10.747,01:04:13.717
and we'll have to describe to
them well actually they're so
smart they'll just figure out

01:04:13.717,01:04:18.722
how it all works. Um and then
something special that only CTF
winners get is we get a leather

01:04:20.957,01:04:25.962
jacket. That's embroidered with
our logo and nobody else,
they're never for sale, we never

01:04:28.364,01:04:34.237
make them for anything else, you
can't buy them, they only go to
winners of capture the flag. So

01:04:34.237,01:04:39.609
that's a special extra bonus for
the CTF winners. [applause] and
so with that I'd like to give

01:04:39.609,01:04:44.614
our 8 badges to the winning
team, PPP. [applause] [inaudible
voices] Right and if that's not

01:05:07.670,01:05:12.675
enough on the back of this badge
there's another puzzle just for
black badge winners to compete

01:05:16.179,01:05:21.184
on. [whooping] So >>Last year I
announced at a choice of
architecture and rule set to see

01:05:25.388,01:05:30.326
what teams could build with a
year of preparation. While the
game let us ask some interesting

01:05:30.326,01:05:36.566
questions and get some interes
er interesting answers we will
be making some changes for 2017.

01:05:36.566,01:05:42.906
We will be running a far more
traditional capture the flag
rule set with a twist. The 2017

01:05:42.906,01:05:47.577
Defcon capture the flag will
feature a custom processor
architecture running on a custom

01:05:47.577,01:05:52.582
operating system. We look
forward to seeing everybody next
year. [whooping] [applause]

01:05:55.952,01:06:00.890
>>Thank you. Alright that is it
for contests and events. Again
uh thanks to everybody who put

01:06:08.498,01:06:14.170
together a contest, a village,
an event, a party, the folks who
spoke in the demo labs and if

01:06:14.170,01:06:17.941
you have things that uh that you
are interested in putting up
there again reach out to me

01:06:17.941,01:06:24.347
grifter at uh Defcon dot org.
Now um running all these events
and doing all these things and

01:06:24.347,01:06:30.220
having parties at night and
villages and craziness and all
these crowds can get fairly

01:06:30.220,01:06:37.026
difficult. Um there are a lot of
you and it's overwhelming uh for
my team. Uh we can't control it

01:06:37.026,01:06:42.031
all uh so we rely on the soc
goons to help us do that. So um
we don't often get to hear from

01:06:44.100,01:06:48.905
the soc goons. I think it'd be
great if uh if we could get CJ
up here to uh to tell us what

01:06:48.905,01:06:53.877
went on this weekend. And while
I still have somebody typing
this stuff up on the on the

01:06:53.877,01:07:00.283
board it's SOC soc. Um I'm crip
bitch. [laughing] [whooping]
>>Hey [applause] well first of

01:07:00.283,01:07:06.489
all [applause] this is Tassidus.
Tassidus is my second. He's the
guy who actually does all the

01:07:06.489,01:07:11.494
hard work. [yelling] [applause]
>>I mostly want to thank you
lot. We had an unprecedented

01:07:16.566,01:07:21.804
amount of attendees this year.
We were not expecting to grow
the way we did and we also had

01:07:21.804,01:07:27.143
an unprecedented low number of
incidents. That's down to you
guys. This was probably the

01:07:27.143,01:07:33.349
safest conference I've ever run.
There were a few issues. All of
them got handled. You guys were

01:07:33.349,01:07:38.121
super respectful to the hotel,
you worked hard with the hotel.
Infact, we got a thank you

01:07:38.121,01:07:44.494
letter from Caesar's calling out
one of my guys and calling out
an attendee for their help in

01:07:44.494,01:07:47.797
taking down a jewel thief who
was running through the
conference. [whooping]

01:07:47.797,01:07:52.802
[applause] So I'd like to give a
shout out to Hatori on my team
and Nikki, the attendee who

01:08:00.710,01:08:05.715
after being hit by the uh jewel
thief managed to place her foot
on his throat. [laughter]

01:08:11.154,01:08:17.593
[whooping] [applause] >>Don't
mess with Defcon attendees.
[laughter] >>There was one sort

01:08:17.593,01:08:22.865
of unfortunate incident that I
have to bring up. We had an
attendee who got 86'd from the

01:08:22.865,01:08:28.571
Whiskey Pirates Party. It really
bummed me out because the guy
was really not trying to be an

01:08:28.571,01:08:33.576
asshole [laughter] but he was
playing around, putting stuff up
that matched Caesar's equipment

01:08:33.576,01:08:39.082
and course when you poke the
bear, the bear responds and
Caesars came down with about 30

01:08:39.082,01:08:45.188
security guards. They were super
kind. They actually pulled back,
reduced the numbers, agreed not

01:08:45.188,01:08:50.493
to prosecute him, and were in
talks about fixing things so
that he can come back so long as

01:08:50.493,01:08:56.032
he doesn't do anything else like
that. [laughter] Um but the one
thing that came out of it though

01:08:56.032,01:09:01.471
I'd like to remind all of you
guys is, all of us in red shirts
are here to help you, we're part

01:09:01.471,01:09:08.244
of the community. We're not here
to make money, we we're all
volunteers. Help us help you. So

01:09:08.244,01:09:13.116
if there's an incident and we're
there and we'll ask you
questions, be upfront and honest

01:09:13.116,01:09:17.053
and if it's something you're
nervous about talking about,
take one of us to one side.

01:09:17.053,01:09:23.159
We're on your side but if you
don't tell us upfront what
happened, and they know

01:09:23.159,01:09:28.564
something that we don't' know,
we're totally disabled at that
point. We cannot help you. And

01:09:28.564,01:09:32.969
that's what happened in this
case. He wasn't clear with what
was going on and so we said it

01:09:32.969,01:09:37.573
was one thing and Caesar's
rolled out a whole bunch of data
that showed it was another thing

01:09:37.573,01:09:44.080
and so we looked like fools uh
so help us help you. But other
than that it was a fantastic

01:09:44.080,01:09:49.919
year. Uh I've never worked this
hard. We sold almost all of our
badges by about 11 a m on

01:09:49.919,01:09:56.259
Thursday. Infact it's fair to
say we did more badges between 6
a m and 11 a m on Thursday than

01:09:56.259,01:10:01.264
we did through the entire
conference last year. That's
pretty impressive. Uh [whooping]

01:10:08.304,01:10:12.041
[applause] When I got press
ganged into taking this role, I
woke up and there was a coin

01:10:12.041,01:10:17.046
that said you have to fucking do
this. We were seeing cue times
of about 4 hours and it was

01:10:20.717,01:10:26.823
brutal I mean you guys know it.
Line con was a thing. This year
the average time turn around

01:10:26.823,01:10:31.828
time for the line throughout the
whole time it was open was 40
minutes. Uh >>Ya! [whistling]

01:10:34.297,01:10:40.970
[whooping] [applause] >>And the
fastest time we clocked, was 27
minutes. If someone had told me

01:10:40.970,01:10:45.041
4 years ago that we would have
registration times of 20
minutes, I'd tell them they're

01:10:45.041,01:10:52.014
an idiot but, [laughing] we got
there and I hope we stay there.
It's it's much better to see you

01:10:52.014,01:10:57.920
guys come out of the line happy,
get straight into the conference
and enjoy it. So thank you for

01:10:57.920,01:11:02.358
all the help you guys did and in
particular thank you to all the
other departments that made this

01:11:02.358,01:11:08.531
work. Thank you to my team I the
whole registration experience
was an entire team thing. Every

01:11:08.531,01:11:12.335
department in Defcon was
involved in making that come
together and when it came

01:11:12.335,01:11:17.340
together it was beautiful. Thank
you. [applause] >>Everything CJ
said and more. [laughter] >>What

01:11:25.214,01:11:30.219
he said >>Where are my soc goons
at? >>Yaa!! [yelling] [applause]
>> I wanna thank you all. I was

01:11:36.359,01:11:41.264
nervous stepping up into this
role but you made my life easy.
You guys are awesome, I fucking

01:11:41.264,01:11:46.269
love you guys. Thank you so
much. [yelling] [applause]Hi
Defcon [laughter] bye Defcon

01:11:57.947,01:12:01.951
[laughter] [applause] >>Okay
we're almost done but we have a
new special edition this year.

01:12:01.951,01:12:07.557
So we have goons that have been
supporting and making Defcon
happen for I mean for years,

01:12:07.557,01:12:14.197
decades. Literally decades and
just like we have a badge for
people who win contests, the

01:12:14.197,01:12:20.603
black badge. This year we
created an official badge uh for
goons. Goons that have served

01:12:20.603,01:12:26.709
Defcon for 10 or more years and
have retired or retiring this
year, and for all the effort and

01:12:26.709,01:12:33.216
energy they've put in, the new
badge will allow them admission
for life. As an acknowledgment

01:12:33.216,01:12:38.221
of their dedication and so we
have [applause] [yelling] We
have a list of retiring gold

01:12:45.428,01:12:50.967
badgee [inaudible word] In the
past dating back as far as we
can identify to this year. We

01:12:50.967,01:12:56.038
have a list of all the retired
goons with 10 or more years and
since it'll take to long to

01:12:56.038,01:13:00.076
bring them all up, if you're
here and you are receiving a
gold badge please come up in the

01:13:00.076,01:13:05.781
front and we'll get you your
gold badge here on the side and
of course, we have to do some

01:13:05.781,01:13:10.653
anti counterfeiting maneuvers.
But if we could acknowledge the
dedication and the commitment of

01:13:10.653,01:13:15.591
this team I'd really appreciate
it as we get them their gold
badges. Thank you so much.

01:13:15.591,01:13:20.596
[yelling] [applause] >>Well come
on down come on down [applause]
so what're you gonna do

01:13:59.468,01:14:04.407
[inaudible words] [applause]
[whistling] Wooh! [applause]
[whistling] Wooh! [applause]

01:14:18.888,01:14:24.026
Zack. Zack [applause] Come on up
if you wanna say anything. Ya,
I've invited Zack up to say a

01:14:24.026,01:14:29.031
couple of words. He himself
having been retired um has a
unique insight. >>Okay for

01:14:33.536,01:14:38.841
almost 20 years I've been
ringmaster of this shit show
that we call Defcon. [laughter]

01:14:38.841,01:14:43.846
and the most important thing for
me is I've watched this
community grow from a bunch of

01:14:50.553,01:14:55.558
teenagers that had, let's face
it, no fucking control.
[laughter] [yelling] To to to

01:14:59.261,01:15:04.200
what we are today right? And
that is a big fucking deal
right? Blood code, a random

01:15:08.337,01:15:13.342
little things created by Jason
Straight [applause] for bar code
right? [applause] Generated more

01:15:18.581,01:15:23.586
blood than the fucking every
fucking doctors convention that
rocked up in Vegas. They were

01:15:26.856,01:15:31.861
shipping blood out of the state
because they couldn't handle it
in in Nevada right? That's us

01:15:36.232,01:15:48.544
and that's a big deal right?
[whooping] [applause] So you
need to understand that.

01:15:48.544,01:15:54.083
[applause] We're fucking Defcon!
[applause] [whooping] >>So if we
can get all the all the goons

01:15:54.083,01:15:59.155
off to the side you're gonna
have you sign the registry book
get you your gold badge and uh

01:15:59.155,01:16:04.794
and then see you at the party
tonight uh the goon only party.
That you guys aren't invited to

01:16:04.794,01:16:11.734
cause now we get to party!
[cheering] Now it's with a
little bit of regret I have to

01:16:11.734,01:16:20.142
announce the retirement of an
old friend. The smiley face
Defcon logo >>what? [aww] >>Yes.

01:16:20.142,01:16:25.714
The smiley face was created for
Defcon 20 and it was never
intended to last more than a

01:16:25.714,01:16:30.719
year but through the love and
care and feeding of uh of
Zedler. It survived until 20 4

01:16:32.888,01:16:38.260
with duct tape and literal
bailing wire and it just it
could not the the way we store

01:16:38.260,01:16:43.032
it, the desert heat it's
literally been disintegrating
for years. Um it just can't

01:16:43.032,01:16:49.104
survive another year of coming
up and down. So what we're gonna
do is we're retiring the smiley

01:16:49.104,01:16:55.444
today. It's going down it's
being shipped to a maker space,
it's pieces are being cut into

01:16:55.444,01:17:02.351
little pieces into little mini
smileys and next year we're
gonna hand out mini smileys and

01:17:02.351,01:17:09.525
we're gonna replace it with the
new smiley. So at Defcon 25 our
25th anniversary next year it'll

01:17:09.525,01:17:15.998
be out with the old friend,
who'll live on in mini smileys
and we'll be introducing our new

01:17:15.998,01:17:24.073
friend. So speaking of next
year, how many of you remember
Defcon 1 when we all actually

01:17:24.073,01:17:26.842
fit into this little VW bug?
[laughter] Alright [laughter]
This is where we've been right

01:17:26.842,01:17:35.918
this is the best. We had to do a
new flow diagram since last
year. I thought the flow this

01:17:35.918,01:17:42.057
year was really fantastic.
22,000 people and it didn't feel
very crowded at time I mean at

01:17:42.057,01:17:50.266
times of course crowded but not
nearly as bad as I thought it'd
be with 22,000. But with the

01:17:50.266,01:17:57.006
25th anniversary we wanna do
something new and special and uh
so we talked with the our with

01:17:57.006,01:18:15.291
the hotel and we went over our
options and so next year we're
going to be at Caesars Palace.

01:18:15.291,01:18:18.761
[cheering] [applause] Now this
is gonna be really interesting
because it's a stacked we've got

01:18:18.761,01:18:23.999
2 floors on one side. Um we've
got the pool we've got a lot of
really cool stuff over there

01:18:23.999,01:18:29.805
we've got about 50,000 more
square feet and well that's not
a whole lot space now that we're

01:18:29.805,01:18:35.644
so big I mean it it's some space
but what the best part is a lot
of it is modern and we can put

01:18:35.644,01:18:41.317
air walls everywhere and so inss
we can slice and dice the spaces
and we can better take care of

01:18:41.317,01:18:45.955
some of these contests and
events and we can really try to
create more intimate spaces uh

01:18:45.955,01:18:51.427
and experiences for you to
interact with each other so it's
gonna get us a lot of new stuff

01:18:51.427,01:18:58.901
next year. And as usual anytime
we change hotels, we always want
to hear from you what do we do

01:18:58.901,01:19:03.572
with the space. I really
believed the first year we were
gonna come here we had so much

01:19:03.572,01:19:08.310
new space I figured we have to
close off half paris and not use
it because we weren't big

01:19:08.310,01:19:13.315
enough. We've essentially
outgrown the paris and bally's
in 2 years. Unbelievable.

01:19:16.785,01:19:23.158
[cheering] [applause] So with
that said [applause] all the
video, all the packet captures,

01:19:23.158,01:19:29.131
all the presentations,
everything we can record, grab,
capture, copy, will be online in

01:19:29.131,01:19:34.203
the coming weeks and months. If
you have any memories or files
or evidence you wanna share with

01:19:34.203,01:19:39.074
us we're happy to put it online
and with that said I'm
officially calling to a close

01:19:39.074,00:00:00.000
Defcon 24 see you next year.
