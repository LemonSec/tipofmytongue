00:00:00.000-->00:00:06.506
>>So our first speaker of the
day is Chris Rock. So Chris
spoke last year in my speaking

00:00:06.506-->00:00:12.145
track, gave an excellent talk
and it was only twenty minutes
long but it was phenomenal. You

00:00:12.145-->00:00:17.518
guys are in for a real treat.
Let's give Chris Rock a big
hand. [audience applauds]

00:00:17.518-->00:00:39.273
[indistinct chatter off mic]
[silence] >>Thanks guys thanks
for com...oh...thanks for coming

00:00:39.273-->00:00:41.975
to the talk today guys. I know
there's a lot of great talks at
the moment, there's a lot of uh

00:00:41.975-->00:00:45.279
internet of things uh that you
can go and see but I think
you'll enjoy this talk.This is a

00:00:45.279-->00:00:52.986
talk that I thought I would
never talk about. Uhh I was
never gonna talk about this

00:00:52.986-->00:00:58.292
because it was a little bit
risky but I think now that this
is the best time to do this

00:00:58.292-->00:01:01.495
talk. Not because of all the
elections and all that sort of
stuff that's been happening now

00:01:01.495-->00:01:09.002
with the uh Clinton emails for
example, but there was an
article that was released, I'll

00:01:09.002-->00:01:14.741
show you the slide, uh US
National Intelligence Director
James Clapper said that cyber

00:01:14.741-->00:01:21.048
espionage came second. We came
second to ISIS. Now, I don't
want to live in a world where

00:01:21.048-->00:01:37.397
ISIS is scarier than hackers,
especially in 2016. [audience
applause] We previously held the

00:01:37.397-->00:01:43.103
title in the 2013 14 and 15 and
to be honest I was a little bit
disappointed when I saw this

00:01:43.103-->00:01:49.643
result. So I thought I'm in my
40s now, there's uh, a lot of
young hackers in the audience

00:01:49.643-->00:01:54.481
and I'm not gonna pass the baton
to you guys unless we have that
number one spot back in em bep

00:01:54.481-->00:02:04.791
back in our part. So let's have
a quick look at ISIS. Bit of a
no brainer here, when you have a

00:02:04.791-->00:02:10.897
an occupier of an occupied
country, you have a terrorist
organization. Nothing is changed

00:02:10.897-->00:02:17.004
throughout history. I know it's
a simplistic view, but it uh it
is an accurate view. So the

00:02:17.004-->00:02:21.274
first thing we need to do is
when we lose and we did lose we
came 2nd we beat North Korea

00:02:21.274-->00:02:27.180
that's really good they've got
nukes they're pretty scary. But
we can hack anything we want. I

00:02:27.180-->00:02:30.651
know there's a lot of people in
this audience could hack
anything I asked them to hack;

00:02:30.651-->00:02:33.453
banks, government, whatever. We
just need to put it all
together. So the first thing we

00:02:33.453-->00:02:46.566
need to do is work out why we
came 2nd so let's have a look at
ISIS, let's see how they fight.

00:02:46.566-->00:02:55.842
[Indistinguishable sounds off
mic] I just need some aud...I I
just need some audio. That...

00:02:55.842-->00:03:30.177
that jack. [indistinct voices
off mic] Thanks Now this this
gets a little bit violent so if

00:03:30.177-->00:03:35.849
there is any any kids in the au
audience that have come by
roots, I apologize, but I showed

00:03:35.849-->00:03:40.787
it to my 8 year old son and he
was cool with it. [audience
laughs] If he's cool with it,

00:03:40.787-->00:03:48.762
you guys will be cool with it.
So let's have a look at our
competition. [Video playing]

00:03:48.762-->00:03:58.805
[Tribal music] [Rap music
plays]>>La-da-da-da-dah It's the
motherfuckin' D O double G,

00:03:58.805-->00:04:04.377
Snoop Dogg La-da-da-da-dah You
know I'm mobbin' with the DRE
Yeah, yeah, yeah You know who's

00:04:04.377-->00:04:10.016
back up in this motherfucker?
What, what, what, what? So blaze
the weed up then! [audience

00:04:10.016-->00:04:20.293
laughs][Video continues]
[Traffic sounds][Indistinct
yelling] [Mechanical

00:04:20.293-->00:04:23.063
noises][Crashing
noises][indistinct yelling]
[Music plays] Boom yeah here

00:04:23.063-->00:04:29.870
comes the boom oh here comes the
boom oh [explosion sound]
[audience laughs] [video ends]

00:04:29.870-->00:04:33.306
>>Now I don't know about you
guys but I think that was pretty
embarrassing that we came 2nd to

00:04:33.306-->00:04:47.454
that. [audience laughter]
[audience applauds] S s so now
that we've analyzed our enemy

00:04:47.454-->00:04:53.026
let's have a look at uh
ourselves. So the Sony hack that
was a great hack I love watching

00:04:53.026-->00:05:00.467
those movies every week.
[audience chuckles] The Ashley
Madison hack uh my wife and her

00:05:00.467-->00:05:06.506
lawyer really loved that hack
seeing my name up on that list.
[audience laughs] Now the

00:05:06.506-->00:05:11.378
Pokemon Go hack now I know why
we came 2nd with that shit, with
that denial of service on

00:05:11.378-->00:05:19.286
Pokemon Go thank you PoodleCorp.
And even my talk about death did
not imp uh impress James Clapper

00:05:19.286-->00:05:24.691
enough to give us position
number one. So the reason I'm
giving this talk is to rectify

00:05:24.691-->00:05:29.763
that and to do that I need to
escape away from our normal
hacking uhh environment and we

00:05:29.763-->00:05:36.970
need to skill up a little bit.
The reason we did come second uh
is we're uh too uh tunnel

00:05:36.970-->00:05:41.241
focused. We uh we had tunnel
vision we didn't look outside.
So I thought what I'll need to

00:05:41.241-->00:05:48.415
do is I contacted a mercenary.
He'll be up to teach me some
tactics in uh coups revolutions

00:05:48.415-->00:05:54.187
and then I'll see if I can apply
that, and see if I can do a coup
or revolution myself. So I

00:05:54.187-->00:05:57.924
contacted this guy, his name is
Simon Mann and I'll let you tell
him uh I I'll let him tell you

00:05:57.924-->00:06:05.832
about himself. >>My name is
Simon Mann and I'm helping Chris
Rock with his work to see if a

00:06:05.832-->00:06:13.673
coup d'etat a push to overthrow
their regime could be achieved
by computer hacking and by cyber

00:06:13.673-->00:06:20.146
warfare methods. My background
in that is that I led the 2004
attempted coup against the

00:06:20.146-->00:06:25.719
regime of Equatorial Guinea.
That attempt failed, I was
arrested, I spent 5 and half in

00:06:25.719-->00:06:32.158
years in prison for that. Prior
to that, in 1993 I was one of
the founding people of Executive

00:06:32.158-->00:06:37.931
Outcomes South African private
military contractor which is
credited with winning the

00:06:37.931-->00:06:45.739
ghastly civil wars first in
Angola against the rebels Unita
and then in Sierra Leone against

00:06:45.739-->00:06:54.214
the rebels there. I served in
the first Gulf War on the staff
of Sir Peter de La Billiere. My

00:06:54.214-->00:07:00.587
ten years prior to all of that
was as a British army officer, I
served in the special air

00:07:00.587-->00:07:07.093
service as a troop commander and
an anti-terrorist team commander
as well as in the Scot's Guards

00:07:07.093-->00:07:13.967
as a platoon commander um and
did tours in northern Ireland uh
with both of those units. >>So

00:07:13.967-->00:07:17.637
so he's a master of his field
and I'm a master of mine so I
thought it'd be good if we could

00:07:17.637-->00:07:26.313
combine the two together. So why
would we use mercenaries?
Obviously the clandestine there

00:07:26.313-->00:07:30.450
is no governments that are
linked to uh the mercenaries uh
uh they're loyal so as long as

00:07:30.450-->00:07:42.162
you pay them they're yours, and
it's not a war if you use
mercenaries. [audience chuckles]

00:07:42.162-->00:07:46.700
So this is a traditional
mercenary coup structure so the
the important position there is

00:07:46.700-->00:07:51.171
the architect then you can see a
picture of of Simon Mann there
with the with the gun. Now he's

00:07:51.171-->00:07:57.977
the man that pulls the levers so
up above him for example we have
special interest groups so this

00:07:57.977-->00:08:01.915
is traditionals uh organization
such as the CIA or private
companies who have got oil

00:08:01.915-->00:08:09.389
interests uh and things like
financiers. Now under his uh
direct uh personnel he has

00:08:09.389-->00:08:13.993
obviously advisors and that's an
an important role too. So when
you guys are looking at doing

00:08:13.993-->00:08:17.130
this sort of stuff for real you
might decide that you're an
architect or an advisor it

00:08:17.130-->00:08:22.502
really depends on on how you
think. Um and you can see um
Simon would have um ground air

00:08:22.502-->00:08:27.207
and he would also have um sea,
but now he's developed uh he the
digital domain as well which

00:08:27.207-->00:08:33.380
you'll see in the future because
let's face it the digital domain
in terms of intelligence about

00:08:33.380-->00:08:38.752
what we can um pull umm is very
important. And again there's the
ground people as well so we've

00:08:38.752-->00:08:44.290
got Rambo down there and and Tom
Cruise but these are the ground
so in terms of a cyber

00:08:44.290-->00:08:52.499
perspective we're talking about
hackers. So for for example in
Simon Mann's failed coup in 2004

00:08:52.499-->00:08:57.637
his special interest groups were
people like um who provided
finance were um the Spanish

00:08:57.637-->00:09:03.009
government uhh there was also
Sir Mark Thatcher, which is um
Margaret Thatcher's son who

00:09:03.009-->00:09:10.450
provided finance and uh and an
airplane to move the mercenaries
around. So here's some

00:09:10.450-->00:09:15.522
traditional mercenary companies
uh you can see the CIA down in
the bottom in the left hand

00:09:15.522-->00:09:20.360
corner. Uh and you'll see
obviously Blackwater you guys
know Blackwater quite well but

00:09:20.360-->00:09:25.865
you'll see also in the middle
with the uh the buffalo sign in
the middle that's um there was a

00:09:25.865-->00:09:29.769
uh 32 battalion in South African
defense force that were
guerrilla fighters they fought

00:09:29.769-->00:09:36.376
in Angola and modern day
Namibia. And that was part of
the um uh South African defense

00:09:36.376-->00:09:43.249
force after apartheid um was
abolished in 93 these guys were
out of a job um so they became

00:09:43.249-->00:09:48.188
mercenaries so the companies to
the right of the uh the buffalo
such as Executive Outcomes

00:09:48.188-->00:09:53.760
Agents in San Juan for example,
uh companies that were set up by
uh mercenaries who came out of

00:09:53.760-->00:10:00.500
that um battalion. So when you
guys are looking at overthrowing
a government you really have

00:10:00.500-->00:10:06.506
three options. We have the
election, so rigging an
election. Now an election is a a

00:10:06.506-->00:10:10.310
legitimate way of changing
government every three or four
years not in every country but

00:10:10.310-->00:10:22.622
most uh countries. We can uh
incite a revolution, or a coup.
[audience laughs] So you guys

00:10:22.622-->00:10:29.896
are experiencing this at the
moment so the election, you're
already seeing some email leaks

00:10:29.896-->00:10:33.533
um with um Trump and and Hillary
Clinton. I was watching this
morning about someone was

00:10:33.533-->00:10:38.905
talking about um the size of
Trump's hand which I thought was
fucking ridiculous but um

00:10:38.905-->00:10:44.677
[audience laughs] I think what
they're doing what Wikileaks
doing is is um releasing this

00:10:44.677-->00:10:49.082
information is great but it's
just not really what I'd be
looking for in terms of

00:10:49.082-->00:10:52.418
overthrow of using an election
to overthrow a government. So
I'd be looking at like a twelve

00:10:52.418-->00:10:57.624
days before Christmas or twelve
days before an election tact. It
doesn't have to be real, we

00:10:57.624-->00:11:01.528
already own everything we
already own banks, investments
companies so we can use the

00:11:01.528-->00:11:06.533
items on the right hand side
just to fake whatever we want so
when someone goes towards an

00:11:06.533-->00:11:11.171
election they can just uh use
those things there on the right
hand side so you can actually

00:11:11.171-->00:11:18.711
move money between the parties
and we'll have a look at that in
depth later on. In my country

00:11:18.711-->00:11:23.883
Australia, um we got an SMS just
before we went to the polls. um
Medicare is a bit like your

00:11:23.883-->00:11:29.355
Obama care and it looked like
the SMS was from Medicare and it
was pretty much to scare people

00:11:29.355-->00:11:36.429
into voting for the other party.
The a technique that you can use
too to uh throw an election. And

00:11:36.429-->00:11:41.134
again the Wikileaks the email
leaks uh I was gonna say this
one's been going for too long,

00:11:41.134-->00:11:45.805
these things should be done in
rapid succession to get into the
um voter's mind just before they

00:11:45.805-->00:11:53.112
go to vote. Okay the second
method we have is a revolution.
So here's a couple of

00:11:53.112-->00:12:01.554
revolutions in history you guys
have had one. We had Egypt 2011
and Ukraine 2014. So for those

00:12:01.554-->00:12:07.727
that don't know Ukraine 2014 the
president of uh Ukraine was
about to sign a deal with the

00:12:07.727-->00:12:14.901
EU, gets 7 uh 7 hundred million
dollars in loans and then Putin
stepped in and offered them 2-3

00:12:14.901-->00:12:21.808
billion dollars um to go to to
get rid of that so the people
the people revolted against that

00:12:21.808-->00:12:26.779
and we'll have a look at that a
little bit later on. The other
option is the coup, the coup

00:12:26.779-->00:12:32.285
d'atet. So you saw that recently
in Turkey where a small portion
of the army or in our case

00:12:32.285-->00:12:39.692
mercenaries try to overthrow the
government by force. And you'll
see there there's just some

00:12:39.692-->00:12:50.269
examples of coups and American
government was involved in the
first two of those. So in terms

00:12:50.269-->00:12:53.940
of uh um where we'd want to
start in overthrowing a
government, we start down the

00:12:53.940-->00:12:58.678
bottom. So we have what's called
Tactical Operations or Low
Intensity Operations so this is

00:12:58.678-->00:13:04.784
where you want to weaken the
government with insurgency,
sanctions, or really just um,

00:13:04.784-->00:13:10.957
telling them they're doing a bad
job. Example I've put up there
for the revolution, so if those

00:13:10.957-->00:13:17.296
fail we have the revolution
which we we saw in Ukraine. And
the picture there is the Deputy

00:13:17.296-->00:13:24.137
PM in 2013 before the revolution
was complaining that the
American government were doing

00:13:24.137-->00:13:29.342
um exercises called TechCamp and
they're actually teaching the
people of Ukraine on how to

00:13:29.342-->00:13:33.946
organize protests via Twitter
and via Facebook. And he's
complaining the American

00:13:33.946-->00:13:39.585
government are causing the
revolution before it happened.
If a revolution is not gonna

00:13:39.585-->00:13:45.358
work then we look at the coup.
So the Iran coup over 51-53 was
done by the British government

00:13:45.358-->00:13:54.767
and the US government. And if
that fails, we look at invasion.
So before Panama was invaded,

00:13:54.767-->00:14:05.111
there were 5 failed coups. Uhh
before Manuel Noriega was
replaced in 1999. Things you

00:14:05.111-->00:14:09.449
need to watch out for when
you're doing a revolution, these
are the five things that will

00:14:09.449-->00:14:14.954
try to stop you're revolution,
so the government in power for
example saying that they're

00:14:14.954-->00:14:19.292
gonna have new or fresh
elections, something called
strategic hand lettering which

00:14:19.292-->00:14:24.330
is separating the insurgents
from the population used in the
Vietnam war, the third one which

00:14:24.330-->00:14:27.834
we'll talk about a bit later
called cash grants the you're
are pretty much bribing the

00:14:27.834-->00:14:33.072
people to shut them up. The
third one is a middle
alternative so we have a left

00:14:33.072-->00:14:37.210
party a right party and you
offer a middle party. These are
all techniques just to quiet the

00:14:37.210-->00:14:41.247
population down. You just have
to be aware of these because
they may happen if you're gonna

00:14:41.247-->00:14:46.419
try to set up a revolution. And
the last one is economic
development, organizations and

00:14:46.419-->00:14:50.289
hospital school building. So
when you see the military invade
a country for example like Iraq

00:14:50.289-->00:14:54.060
and they're building schools and
all that sort of crap, it's all
just bullshit they're just

00:14:54.060-->00:14:59.632
keeping an eye on the population
to stop a revolution happening
post that event, that's good

00:14:59.632-->00:15:06.472
publicity as well. Some
techniques for preventing coups
so the private army or the

00:15:06.472-->00:15:11.944
mercenary private military con
contractor. So Colonel Gaddafi
with his three thousand

00:15:11.944-->00:15:19.285
revolutionary guards. The re
soil, sorry, the Saudi Royal
Family with it's 25 thousand

00:15:19.285-->00:15:23.122
wide army, and you guys have
your own national guard, your
private military force

00:15:23.122-->00:15:27.493
protecting each state. Now
that's a great anti-coup measure
so uh you really don't have any

00:15:27.493-->00:15:36.636
central point to overthrow the
government of the US. There's
also spies. So Assad for Syria

00:15:36.636-->00:15:41.808
for example has these spy
agencies that spy on the
military and spy on each other

00:15:41.808-->00:15:47.880
to make sure that no overthrow
takes place there's no coup, and
that works quite well. They work

00:15:47.880-->00:15:52.885
so well that the civil war is
now in place in Syria as you
guys know. And obviously you

00:15:52.885-->00:16:01.627
guys have a lot of intelligence
organizations for this as well.
One thing I wanted to bring up

00:16:01.627-->00:16:06.032
is the fake coup. You gotta be
aware of the fake coup. So on
the on the screen you'll see

00:16:06.032-->00:16:09.802
some coup different coup types
and you're welcome to study
those and there's some material

00:16:09.802-->00:16:14.473
on your CDs which talk about
different types of coups. But
when you're opposition is

00:16:14.473-->00:16:20.780
getting close, you want to
arrest them and just say that
they're causing a coup. This

00:16:20.780-->00:16:26.986
worked well in Turkey in early
2000 where the AKP party uhh
arrested uhh generals and

00:16:26.986-->00:16:32.291
journalists to say that they
were creating a coup. Now this
actually didn't really happen,

00:16:32.291-->00:16:36.362
there there was digital evidence
that had been modified and these
guys were cleared. And then

00:16:36.362-->00:16:42.401
obviously there was another just
coup recently we don't know
whether it was fake or not yet.

00:16:42.401-->00:16:47.073
This is a little bit of theory
the guys to get you started and
I wanted to talk to you I'm not

00:16:47.073-->00:16:51.077
re really much of a theory guy I
need to know how to create a
coup or a revolution but now I

00:16:51.077-->00:16:59.919
want to apply it to a real
country. Operation Nanny Goat
2011. So you guys would have

00:16:59.919-->00:17:06.526
heard of Kuwait, small oil
producing country near somewhere
between Iraq Saudi Arabia. About

00:17:06.526-->00:17:15.001
3 or 4 million people. That's a
picture of Kuwait. [audience
laughs] Actually it looks like

00:17:15.001-->00:17:22.842
this so it's pretty close. No
seriously this is what Kuwait,
it's a beautiful city. So what

00:17:22.842-->00:17:29.515
we'll do is let's have a look at
Kuwait city. This is the
government and also family tree

00:17:29.515-->00:17:36.522
they're pretty much exactly the
same thing. We have the Amir at
top you might see common link in

00:17:36.522-->00:17:42.762
the last names Al-Sabah all the
way through so we have the amir
crown prince, the prime

00:17:42.762-->00:17:48.200
minister, whose name is Nyssa
Al-Sabah and then you can see
the foreign affairs and defense

00:17:48.200-->00:17:54.640
ministries. Now what we want to
do here is we want to overthrow
prime minister Nyssa. And for

00:17:54.640-->00:18:00.046
those you know the Una Oi the
Una Oil scandal, the bribery
scandal, they referred to him as

00:18:00.046-->00:18:08.621
the Big Cheese. So this is the
standard intelligence that
mercenaries or militaries will

00:18:08.621-->00:18:13.993
use, you guys probably will know
this some of this stuff like the
NSA and also uh embassy spies

00:18:13.993-->00:18:21.801
and five eyes. What what can we
use? So we can also we can use
private intelligence agencies,

00:18:21.801-->00:18:28.808
umm Wikileaks for example, and I
don't know if you guys can y-you
guys can read that but um the

00:18:28.808-->00:18:33.679
what they referred to Sheikh
Nyssa Al-Sabah is polite
perceived as politically

00:18:33.679-->00:18:38.217
incompetent protocol one. His
record is tarnished by his
failure to construct and

00:18:38.217-->00:18:46.692
effective manage his government.
But, I believe the best
intelligence is the one you hack

00:18:46.692-->00:19:01.407
yourself, and I wanna hack all
the government to find out what
he's up to. Ok so looking at the

00:19:01.407-->00:19:07.780
intelligence we think corruption
is going to be the big point in
this one. Here's a map of Kuwait

00:19:07.780-->00:19:13.085
and you can see the green which
is the oil fields of Kuwait and
uh the people are not happy that

00:19:13.085-->00:19:19.158
the government are rich and the
people feel really poor. Now
corruption's not gonna work in

00:19:19.158-->00:19:23.929
every country you're gonna have
to find the weakness in each
country. For example Nigeria uh

00:19:23.929-->00:19:28.000
sorry, Anonymous thought that it
would attack Nigeria on their
corruption, which is pretty

00:19:28.000-->00:19:33.939
fucking pointless, because that
is Nigeria's biggest export.
[audience chuckles] It won't

00:19:33.939-->00:19:43.616
work there. So what are our
options for overthrow?
Elections? Nah there's no real

00:19:43.616-->00:19:47.086
elections. Those screw top
parties there the Amir crown
prince and the prime minister,

00:19:47.086-->00:19:54.560
there's no elections for those
guys. The elections are for the
guys below them. So we're not

00:19:54.560-->00:20:01.867
gonna look at the election. Coup
d'etas? No it's too hot. So
here's a map of Kuwait. The

00:20:01.867-->00:20:07.473
white dots is the US military
bases, the green is the Kuwait
army and the purple is the air

00:20:07.473-->00:20:13.112
force. They also have 7 thousand
soldiers protecting the royal
family. So coup I'm not I'm not

00:20:13.112-->00:20:22.621
a big fan of uh racing against
those horses, so it looks like
revolution is our only option.

00:20:22.621-->00:20:28.194
So in 2011 you guys all probably
remember this was the Arab
Spring. So eh on the left hand

00:20:28.194-->00:20:33.332
side you'll see the countries
that uh recently fell. And on
the right hand side you'll see a

00:20:33.332-->00:20:38.237
timeline of the countries in
that region that either fell uh
by a revolution, coup,

00:20:38.237-->00:20:45.010
assassination, uh or just
protests. And you can see Kuwait
down the bottom uh in light

00:20:45.010-->00:20:55.387
blue. Cabinet resigns. So here's
an extract from Edward Luttwak
if you guys want to to do these

00:20:55.387-->00:20:58.824
sort of coups and revolutions
you're need gonna have to study
up on this guy, he's uhh he's

00:20:58.824-->00:21:05.698
pretty much a master for
strategy. And this illustration
shows, ummm, what the

00:21:05.698-->00:21:09.702
intelligence agencies need to go
through to find out whether
there's a coup taking place. So

00:21:09.702-->00:21:15.641
on the Y axis we have all the
data the intelligence agencies
are gonna go through. On the A

00:21:15.641-->00:21:22.448
in coup planning leakage umm
that is when I'm planning a coup
operation what's gonna leak out

00:21:22.448-->00:21:28.521
when I talk to my advisors and
the hackers. The blue line above
is noise or levels, and the

00:21:28.521-->00:21:33.993
green line here coup plus noise
data is all the intelligence has
come through. And the little X

00:21:33.993-->00:21:41.700
point is when the coup is
uncovered. Obviously you wanna
keep your offset quite low so

00:21:41.700-->00:21:47.373
you don't get detected. So with
our side of a mercenary
structure same to the as a

00:21:47.373-->00:21:53.345
traditional mercenary. Um we're
gonna use things such as denial
of service, attack social

00:21:53.345-->00:22:01.554
engineering, and all our normal
hacking stuff. And it's your job
as the architect to employ these

00:22:01.554-->00:22:04.256
devices uh to get the people on
the ground such as hackers from
your country or overseas

00:22:04.256-->00:22:10.996
countries. You'll need to map
out all the targets of the
country that you want to hack.

00:22:10.996-->00:22:15.768
So we're talking about
government, media, uh
electricity, oil, gas, all those

00:22:15.768-->00:22:22.942
sort of agencies. And you wanna
map out what you want to hack.
Now I'm not really much of a

00:22:22.942-->00:22:28.881
strategic in terms of what items
I wanna hack so I just hack them
all. At least then I have the

00:22:28.881-->00:22:34.787
options of what lever I want to
pull. So as a hacker we know
what sort of tools we use on a

00:22:34.787-->00:22:40.826
normal day to day basis. You
gonna have to learn some new
techniques and tools, not

00:22:40.826-->00:22:45.865
hard,you just need to do a bit
of research. I've just got a
couple of them up there. Uhh a

00:22:45.865-->00:22:50.069
lot of them have to do with
misinformation; so when we're
hacking into banks we want to

00:22:50.069-->00:22:54.473
move money around to make it
look really dodgy. Uhh and also
things like professional

00:22:54.473-->00:22:59.712
agitation so we want to employ
people to do protests like union
members and also university

00:22:59.712-->00:23:10.089
students. Now you gonna have to
finance this operation.
[audience chuckles] I probably

00:23:10.089-->00:23:15.961
wouldn't recommend this method.
[audience laughs] We nearly got
our goal, but by using the chart

00:23:15.961-->00:23:26.405
below you see that we got
[audience laughs] it didn't take
long before we got uncovered

00:23:26.405-->00:23:31.410
[audience laughs]. So I'm a big
fan in robbing banks, they've
got lots of money, so we'll use

00:23:31.410-->00:23:38.050
the bank's money. You can also
use the banks for depositing
fake corruption payments and

00:23:38.050-->00:23:42.755
I'll share that in a second, uh
terrorism payments or breaking
into the banks such as removing

00:23:42.755-->00:23:48.060
all the money from the banks.
And then uh HIllary Clinton
pretty much said here that we've

00:23:48.060-->00:23:52.665
got the green light to attack
these countries here [audience
murmurs] Saudis, Qataris, and

00:23:52.665-->00:23:59.772
Kuwaitis umm need to stop their
citizens from funding extremist
organizations. Another tactic

00:23:59.772-->00:24:03.942
you can use is move money
between private accounts um from
these terrorists into private

00:24:03.942-->00:24:08.414
accounts such as Hillary Clinton
and use that evidence to uh
paint a bad picture of her. Or

00:24:08.414-->00:24:15.721
Trump. I don't care who wins
they're both lunatics. [audience
chuckles] So let's get into the

00:24:15.721-->00:24:19.558
real world. Here's the central
bank of Kuwait. That's what it
looks like in 2011 on the left

00:24:19.558-->00:24:25.097
hand side and that's what it
looks like now in 2016.
Obviously if you can't hack in

00:24:25.097-->00:24:30.936
through the front door, use the
stuff that you've got around. We
don't have to use the zero day,

00:24:30.936-->00:24:34.840
we've got a thousand targets to
hack, don't get all fancy pants
on me and use your zero day just

00:24:34.840-->00:24:42.448
use whatever you can. So whether
it be a LAN tour er a LAN turtle
or route through pay you can see

00:24:42.448-->00:24:46.952
that little box now I don't know
if you guys know what that is uh
the fourth picture along that's

00:24:46.952-->00:24:53.359
a NS tool you slug it's a NAZ
box which we'll use as a um a PC
or a, a rat so a physical rat

00:24:53.359-->00:25:00.432
within an organization. Or what
we did is we just hacked in the
front door. If you can't hack in

00:25:00.432-->00:25:08.841
through the front door, just pay
a cleaner and they'll put one of
these implants in for you.

00:25:08.841-->00:25:13.312
Average cleaning salary in
Kuwait is about $150 dollars a
week, so you give them two grand

00:25:13.312-->00:25:18.617
which you'll use from robbing
the banks, they'll plant them in
there for you. So what we want

00:25:18.617-->00:25:23.188
to do for corruption is we wanna
steal money from the government
and put it in private bank's

00:25:23.188-->00:25:27.826
accounts of the government. So
there's a picture of Nyssa uhh
and there's a couple of banks in

00:25:27.826-->00:25:35.768
Kuwait. And an offshore bank. So
now that we own the central
bank, we need to hack private

00:25:35.768-->00:25:40.806
banks. Now we didn't know from
our intelligence which banks he
had bank accounts with, so we

00:25:40.806-->00:25:45.978
just hacked them all. If we're
hacking them all we can then
move money between those bank

00:25:45.978-->00:25:57.256
accounts. So we used government
money and funded the private
bank accounts. By doing this too

00:25:57.256-->00:26:04.696
we could also create bribe
payments as well. Also there's a
lot of money in stocks and

00:26:04.696-->00:26:12.371
finance too so you wanna hack
those as well, uhh even to uh
crash the stock market. And

00:26:12.371-->00:26:20.279
again we went through the front
door. So you wanna know what
your governments up to, whether

00:26:20.279-->00:26:26.051
they're on to you, or you just
wanna see what weaknesses there
are in the government. So you'll

00:26:26.051-->00:26:31.323
need to hack into the government
too to listen to their emails
their phone calls. The interior

00:26:31.323-->00:26:38.864
ministry, the judges,
everything. These are live shots
of of hacked government

00:26:38.864-->00:26:48.173
departments. [long pause] One
thing you want to hack too is
the TelCo... So TelCos are not

00:26:48.173-->00:26:53.378
just phone calls these days,
TelCos are media, Telcos are
internet. You wanna siphon the

00:26:53.378-->00:26:57.516
internet or you wanna squish the
internet for example. This is
the prime case where you want to

00:26:57.516-->00:27:04.389
kill the internet, at the right
time, or keep it open if they
try and close it. So obviously

00:27:04.389-->00:27:09.461
in colacs in point-of-presence
POPS you wanna hack into those.
You wanna be able to stream your

00:27:09.461-->00:27:16.401
own media to get the people
angry. Obviously uh companies
now are using um TelCos for uh

00:27:16.401-->00:27:25.978
cloud services, security
services so Zajil is the biggest
company in Kuwait. Who also prov

00:27:25.978-->00:27:33.352
provide security services for
these companies. So you wanna
hack in, just like what we're

00:27:33.352-->00:27:38.490
doing. That way you can compl-
you can control the flow of
information. You own the ISP,

00:27:38.490-->00:27:44.830
you own the country. Which
brings us to global warming. You
might think "why are we talking

00:27:44.830-->00:27:54.339
about global warming?" So
obviously in uh they wanted to
make sure that they reduce

00:27:54.339-->00:27:59.978
emissions by 2050 and the GEA
and the EU came together and
said what we need to do is map

00:27:59.978-->00:28:04.349
out the current um the
infrastructure such as oil, gas,
and find out what's going on

00:28:04.349-->00:28:10.155
with global warming. So we can
use websites such as in Nupedia
to find out where things are

00:28:10.155-->00:28:17.896
such as um power, oil, um and
and and and nuclear plants. So
you just plug in your country

00:28:17.896-->00:28:21.300
and it'll show you all the maps.
Now why would you want to cut
these services? It's a no

00:28:21.300-->00:28:26.939
brainer. When you wanna do a
revolution or coup you wanna cut
the power at specific times, or

00:28:26.939-->00:28:31.376
cut the water to piss people off
and that that does piss people
off when they live in the

00:28:31.376-->00:28:40.786
desert. And also uh you're
energy sector as well for
example the studies on line if

00:28:40.786-->00:28:45.891
you wanna have a look at that.
High higher voltage transform
units make up less than 3% of

00:28:45.891-->00:28:52.598
transformers in the US, but
carry 60% of the power. So how
do you map those out? You also

00:28:52.598-->00:29:01.340
have websites that do that for
you so what you do is just take
high voltage transformer lines

00:29:01.340-->00:29:07.446
and you'll destroy where the
power comes from, if you wanna
disrupt power. So you you're

00:29:07.446-->00:29:11.950
gonna need to study what a power
station looks like to disrupt
it. So when I was talking to

00:29:11.950-->00:29:18.924
Simon, Simon Mann he said to me
"just blow it up." I...er..
[audience laughs] I...I said

00:29:18.924-->00:29:24.963
"I'm not Zoz I don't have C4 I'm
just gonna chuck on the bloody
thing" so he said "what you need

00:29:24.963-->00:29:28.567
to do is disrupt power." Okay,
no worries. So I thought "well I
can hack into power, so why

00:29:28.567-->00:29:36.875
don't I just shut it off that
way." So here we have a
transformer this is not a

00:29:36.875-->00:29:41.513
picture, this is not an American
picture, so this is not your
critical infrastructure, your

00:29:41.513-->00:29:48.420
honor. This is a picture,
[audience chuckles] this is an
Australian transformer. So the

00:29:48.420-->00:29:54.459
transformers down below and at
the top we have what we call,
umm, mineral oil that keeps it

00:29:54.459-->00:30:02.034
cool. And when a transformer
doesn't have oil, it doesn't
work. So there's no power. In

00:30:02.034-->00:30:07.205
2014 in California, someone was
shooting at these things
draining the oil and then you

00:30:07.205-->00:30:12.377
guys were out of power for 27
days and they just had to
re-route power from another

00:30:12.377-->00:30:16.815
substation. So Simon's
suggestion if you wanna get
hands on, you can you can shoot

00:30:16.815-->00:30:25.757
them, drill them, or angle grind
them to drain that oil. And I
thought "well, I'm not gonna do

00:30:25.757-->00:30:33.899
that. And I've I've failed to
hack in. I fucked up, I couldn't
do it. So you guys have probably

00:30:33.899-->00:30:39.604
seen these before, they're um
the b- these spinning blades
they put on a helicopter that

00:30:39.604-->00:30:44.843
chop trees away from power
lines. For those that haven't
seen 'em, just a just a quick

00:30:44.843-->00:30:52.017
look. Pretty cool. And it
chopped trees from power lines.
Now I thought "well thats pretty

00:30:52.017-->00:30:58.423
cool but I actually want to chop
power lines myself." [audience
laughs]. Now I don't have a

00:30:58.423-->00:31:04.496
helicopter, but why don't I use
a drone. So I thought "I'll make
my own." [audience laughs]

00:31:04.496-->00:31:16.808
[laughing and clapping] So what
we have here is two 8 inch
circular blades attached to part

00:31:16.808-->00:31:22.414
of a bike frame and those just
spin really fast attached to a
cordless drill. And you'll see

00:31:22.414-->00:31:24.750
that uh on the second picture
I've actually removed the
battery and I've actually

00:31:24.750-->00:31:32.958
removed uh the battery from the
pack, only 'cause the battery
kept getting caught on the power

00:31:32.958-->00:31:56.381
line so I removed it. So how
does it work? I'll show ya.
[drill sounds as speaker

00:31:56.381-->00:32:02.954
operates device] So that's a
great device for cutting power
lines. So. [audience claps]

00:32:02.954-->00:32:07.526
That's the 5 pound model. And
you could actually reduce it and
you can make it uh we can get it

00:32:07.526-->00:32:11.296
under three pounds so you can do
it to the weaker drone. So you
just use a series of drones, put

00:32:11.296-->00:32:15.667
the coordinates in and it'll
just run straight through the
power lines. Uh the cables I

00:32:15.667-->00:32:20.071
used there were copper the ones
that you'll that are on power
lines are aluminum so that'll go

00:32:20.071-->00:32:26.545
straight through those. Uhh If
you're gonna make one of these
be really fucking careful, so

00:32:26.545-->00:32:32.384
uh...[audience chuckles] There
is no safety shit involved.
[murmuring from audience] If

00:32:32.384-->00:32:36.955
you're a bit of a tired ass,
just and you've got a small
drone, just hook a ten meter

00:32:36.955-->00:32:43.128
hose to your drone with a piece
of wire, and run it over the
power line, and once it hooks

00:32:43.128-->00:32:49.167
onto the power line, it will
drag it across, and drop it over
the power lines and just arc

00:32:49.167-->00:32:57.108
them. So that's the the cheap
version. So now that we own
everything and we can hack

00:32:57.108-->00:33:00.912
everything including the banks,
we need to understand how the
media works so we need to

00:33:00.912-->00:33:04.549
reverse engineer them. And
that's what we do for a living
so why don't we do it with the

00:33:04.549-->00:33:10.088
media. So what we do is we apply
what's called the Two Source
rule. So the media need two

00:33:10.088-->00:33:15.393
sources to use as a story, and
I've got th the uh sources on
the right hand side and types of

00:33:15.393-->00:33:20.632
sources, so you're gonna need at
least two stories uh sources to
fool the media. Or you can

00:33:20.632-->00:33:24.369
actually pawn a few media
outlets that we did from the
TelCo, publish information, and

00:33:24.369-->00:33:30.876
then just release it. You want
to release the information to
the to the news agency that will

00:33:30.876-->00:33:35.914
release that information without
even questioning it. So for
example Fox News, you want to

00:33:35.914-->00:33:39.384
use the the Hillary Clinton
information they'll publish it
and they won't even give a shit.

00:33:39.384-->00:33:42.921
You don't wanna do it in reverse
'cause then they're not gonna
publish it, they've got no

00:33:42.921-->00:33:51.529
interest in doing that. So what
we did is in 2011 we used Kuwait
central bank we already owned

00:33:51.529-->00:33:57.535
them so we used unnamed
government officials to transfer
millions of dollars outside the

00:33:57.535-->00:34:05.143
accounts into their private bank
accounts. And we used the New
York Times to do the same thing,

00:34:05.143-->00:34:12.918
using that two source rule. Now
one of my idiot advisors thought
this would be a great idea. He

00:34:12.918-->00:34:18.290
thought using a Kuwaiti prince
convert to Christiality
Christianity would be a good

00:34:18.290-->00:34:23.662
idea and went with it. He did
get the publicity he was after,
we got a hundred med media

00:34:23.662-->00:34:33.371
outlets that uh went with that,
but it was just a stupid idea.
You need to use the people in

00:34:33.371-->00:34:40.045
this when the CIA using uh when
the CIA planning a coup or
revolution you need to get the

00:34:40.045-->00:34:46.251
people on side. You've got money
in your hands, you need to use
bribes. So...use this sort of

00:34:46.251-->00:34:50.855
money to pay people to put
implants within companies,
professional agitation

00:34:50.855-->00:34:56.027
misinformation, ah or get
corporate people to do stuff for
you. You've got to heat the

00:34:56.027-->00:35:01.600
population up enough to give a
shit to overthrow the
government. So for example the

00:35:01.600-->00:35:06.538
professional agitators you would
have a group of people that you
would pay to cause a protest and

00:35:06.538-->00:35:12.677
then you would get another group
of protesters dressed in police
uniforms to bash them up. And

00:35:12.677-->00:35:15.780
then then you get that on the
news. And if they weren't
published on the news you

00:35:15.780-->00:35:21.686
publish your own news, you own
the TelCo. When you're planning
the operation, you need to plan

00:35:21.686-->00:35:28.893
it down to the absolute detail
and you need to be uh, flexible,
'cause shit just won't go right.

00:35:28.893-->00:35:34.265
You might lose a rat, you just
need to have the plan for umm
for changes in your in your

00:35:34.265-->00:35:41.239
operation. So I've I've talked a
lot and I want to show you how
it works in in the real world.

00:35:41.239-->00:35:59.424
So I've put a video together
just to show uh how it works.

leave you with now is for the

00:41:56.381-->00:42:03.187
new hackers in th in the new
generation is just think bigger.
So don't try and hack bigger

00:42:03.187-->00:42:06.891
targets, but combine multiple
targets and look side out
outside of your industry to

00:42:06.891-->00:42:10.995
combine multiple things
together. That's it guys and
then we'll be number one again.

00:42:10.995-->00:00:00.000
