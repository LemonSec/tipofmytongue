00:00:00.500,00:00:04.171
Um, I'm happy to introduce this
talk, it's always one of my
favourites and because I'm

00:00:04.171,00:00:09.810
introducing it I actually get to
see it for once. So, it's
Opening Ceremonies and the Badge

00:00:09.810,00:00:14.815
Talk and it's got "Lost Boy" and
"The Dark Tangent" and when "The
Dark Tangent" shows up, he'll

00:00:16.850,00:00:21.855
show up, but for now here's
"Lost". [applause]. >>How many
of you is this your first

00:00:33.467,00:00:38.472
Defcon? Wow. Welcome. How many
of you are here from out of the
country? Wow! Thank you for

00:00:43.510,00:00:48.515
coming. Give them a hand for
traveling this far. [applause].
So bear with us here, Jeff's on

00:00:55.956,00:01:01.161
his way over. He was over at the
DARPA stuff and so, er, he may
be a little helter-skelter. Um,

00:01:01.161,00:01:04.298
for those of you who've come to
openings, how many of you have
come to an opening ceremonies

00:01:04.298,00:01:10.037
before? And you still came back
to an opening ceremonies talk,
uh? So, I'm going to do

00:01:10.037,00:01:15.709
something a little different
this year. For those of you who
don't know, I'm Ryan Clark, "The

00:01:15.709,00:01:21.315
Lost Boy", 1o57, whatever you
wanna call me. But I would like
to start with a solemn moment.

00:01:21.315,00:01:26.320
The letter of apology. Bear with
me. First an open letter of
apology: to those who start

00:01:28.822,00:01:35.228
working long before Defcon
starts, as is generally frowned
upon, on the badge challenge,

00:01:35.228,00:01:40.233
I'm sorry. I'm sorry for the
mis-direction. I'm especially
sorry to those who go to the

00:01:42.436,00:01:47.441
trouble of automating, pulling
down all of the index files from
my servers. I'm especially sorry

00:01:49.843,00:01:54.982
for the con job that may have
been started, that appended
random texts and are certain

00:01:54.982,00:02:00.520
strings to different files that
may change. The the pull down
er, finger prints that you were

00:02:00.520,00:02:05.826
doing on the pages. I'm sorry
for the extra bandwidth the day
I decided to make that run every

00:02:05.826,00:02:12.799
minute. [laughter from the
audience]. I'm sorry for ruining
the hash comparisons you did to

00:02:12.799,00:02:18.905
watch for clues and flags that
may have been put up over the
time. I'm sorry to those who

00:02:18.905,00:02:23.543
decided to search registrar
information, for domains that
may have been registered as part

00:02:23.543,00:02:30.150
of the contest. I'm sorry that I
consistently used my Chinese
name Lee Yourshang and this time

00:02:30.150,00:02:35.522
randomly switched to my Korean
name E.G. Sang, therefore
foiling any searches for said

00:02:35.522,00:02:40.527
information. I'm especially
sorry for when I put troll hook
misdirection pages up realising

00:02:43.430,00:02:48.568
that you weren't finding them
fast enough, that your exploits
were not as efficient as I

00:02:48.568,00:02:52.739
believed them to be, that I
then, in fact, changed the name
in the registration back to the

00:02:52.739,00:02:57.744
one I knew you were searching
for, so you would in fact find
the troll page. [laughter from

00:03:01.281,00:03:05.686
the audience]. But! I would like
to have a moment of
reconciliation. By a show of

00:03:05.686,00:03:11.258
hands, how many of you are
familiar with the Mystery
Challenge? So few of you. I used

00:03:11.258,00:03:15.829
to run a contest at Defcon every
year called the Mystery
Challenge. And, erm, wow,

00:03:15.829,00:03:22.569
everybody turn and say hi to
Jeff. >>Hey. [audience says in
unison: hi Jeff] >>So he did

00:03:22.569,00:03:26.173
make it. So I'm going to as, I'm
actually going to hold off on
what I was about to to tell you

00:03:26.173,00:03:31.178
because I would like Jeff to be
able to get some more stage
first as he, as he comes up

00:03:36.650,00:03:41.655
here. >>Good morning! >>"Dark
Tangent" everybody. [ applause].
>>Woo! >>Sorry I'm late, what

00:03:49.029,00:03:54.167
d'ya got? [inaudible] >>We're
gonna talk secret stuff, and we
like don't trust you to do that

00:03:54.167,00:03:59.206
whole like 2001 lip analysis, so
we're going to turn our heads
away from you. >>Holy shit!

00:03:59.206,00:04:03.977
>>Yeah. [laughter from the
audience]. >>Oh. That's really
cool. >>We're gonna show that

00:04:03.977,00:04:10.517
thing off to you in a minute.
Um, and show what everybody's
competing for. For uber badges.

00:04:10.517,00:04:16.690
So. >>Do you want to reveal
that? >>I got it. I got it.
>>You got a whole flow?

00:04:16.690,00:04:20.227
[inaudible] >>Okay, yes, so my
thing is just hello and welcome
and thank you for coming to our

00:04:20.227,00:04:27.033
biggest conference ever. And, we
have some really cool shit to,
er, to show you this year. We've

00:04:27.033,00:04:32.472
really grown, er, and for those
of you – how many people here –
have you already done this? –

00:04:32.472,00:04:37.010
How many people's new? >>There's
a huge amount >>Huge. Okay so we
can totally indoctrinate you.

00:04:37.010,00:04:42.015
Um, So the theory I've always
done with Defcon is , um, my
operating sort of principle is

00:04:46.319,00:04:51.558
that I try to, er, give space to
people who want to do stuff. So,
if you come to me and you say:

00:04:51.558,00:04:55.328
"I want to do a bio-hacking
village," I say: " Great, that
sounds really cool , what is

00:04:55.328,00:05:00.667
that?" And then they explain it,
and if they can convince me, or
some other people, okay we'll

00:05:00.667,00:05:04.905
give you a shot. We'll find room
for you. And if other people
think it's cool, it will grow.

00:05:04.905,00:05:11.144
And if other people don't think
it's cool, or you can't organise
it then it collapses and through

00:05:11.144,00:05:16.650
this sort of Darwinian process
we've ended up with what we've
got. And so anytime you see

00:05:16.650,00:05:20.887
something new, they kinda had to
run through that gauntlet and
they are trying to see if their

00:05:20.887,00:05:24.624
idea can survive in this
community. And if you see
something disappear, it's either

00:05:24.624,00:05:28.862
they've gotten burned out, or
they're on to something new. And
what I love about this community

00:05:28.862,00:05:32.165
is, you'll see people and
they'll being doing social
engineering one year, contest

00:05:32.165,00:05:37.838
hacking the next, they'll start
a context, they'll play in a
contest, um, and people just

00:05:37.838,00:05:42.275
keep hopping around, and
sometimes people come and
apologize to me and say: "You

00:05:42.275,00:05:47.847
know what, I'm just so burned
out, I don't want to do this one
thing anymore". And you don't

00:05:47.847,00:05:54.020
have to apologize to me, this is
you, this is your contest, this
is your idea – it's about you.

00:05:54.020,00:05:58.024
Do what you like to do. And I'm
just here to try and provide a
stage. And so, if you're not

00:05:58.024,00:06:02.195
that interested in that anymore,
great, find something else
you're interested in. Or just go

00:06:02.195,00:06:07.033
play video games, you know,
re-energise yourself. Just watch
talks for a year. Just do

00:06:07.033,00:06:12.772
something to get your energy
back. And so, I just really want
it to be, just like this like

00:06:12.772,00:06:19.112
boiling cauldron of randomness.
Right? This entropy. And, I
think it's been a success

00:06:19.112,00:06:24.618
because we've got so many people
that come each year, er, and so
then it's just professional cat

00:06:24.618,00:06:31.591
herding and, and I'm not saying
you guys are cats but, you're
cats. Um, and maybe this year

00:06:31.591,00:06:36.363
everyone's like a Pokemon or
something, but er, and
apparently Pokemon are easier to

00:06:36.363,00:06:41.368
catch here than over at Black
Hat, I'm just sayin'. [laughter
from the audience]. Um, there's

00:06:43.637,00:06:47.374
er, we have a closing ceremony
and we always make a bunch of
announcements: top winning

00:06:47.374,00:06:51.111
teams, er, and this year we
gonna have some particularly
interesting announcements at the

00:06:51.111,00:06:56.116
closing ceremony. Oh, yeah,
that's right, and then, um, so
for those of you who don't know

00:06:59.119,00:07:04.157
"Lost" he is like the puzzle
master for Defcon. And he's done
his own Mystery Challenge, he's

00:07:04.157,00:07:08.561
done, he does the badge
challenge that you see a lot of
people competing with, um, he's

00:07:08.561,00:07:13.667
involved in designing the uber
badges, or, he designs uber
badges, so there's a lot that he

00:07:13.667,00:07:20.006
does well. Do I tell the story
about the shopper? We're going
to be making an announcement

00:07:20.006,00:07:23.043
we've never done before. We
normally just tell you and
orientate you in what's going on

00:07:23.043,00:07:28.915
in the con. Ask questions, um,
is always the one thing I like
to say. You are here to

00:07:28.915,00:07:33.586
challenge the speaker, so this
is not meant to be sort of
passive you receive information.

00:07:33.586,00:07:38.158
Active, I'm telling you the
information. I really want it to
be challenge to speaker, and if

00:07:38.158,00:07:42.595
they're saying something you
don't like or don't agree with
or you think is inaccurate,

00:07:42.595,00:07:46.199
you've gotta say something,
right? Otherwise you're just
letting the mis-information

00:07:46.199,00:07:51.538
perpetuate and that's not cool.
So, just because there's a lot
of you and one or two speakers,

00:07:51.538,00:07:55.342
er, that doesn't mean you have
to remain quiet, you gotta get
engaged. Um, so, anyway, this

00:07:55.342,00:08:00.447
year, er, we've never announced
software before, but it was such
a compelling story, er, "Lost"

00:08:00.447,00:08:02.449
is actually going to release,
er, a tool that was inspired,
that somebody had to build to

00:08:02.449,00:08:04.451
try, to compete in one of his
contests. So, I don't know if
you wanna tell everybody about

00:08:04.451,00:08:06.453
that before you get going?
>>Yeah, so far as I know this is
the first time in an open

00:08:06.453,00:08:11.458
ceremonies talk we're actually
going to release a tool.
[inaudible] To be fair, Jeff and

00:08:22.369,00:08:26.239
a lot of people tend to give me
a lot of credit, um, there's a
lot of people involved, and I'll

00:08:26.239,00:08:30.410
talk about that in a minute, but
a lot of what I do would never
happen if weren't for the

00:08:30.410,00:08:36.916
support of a few people, um such
as E chan and Swizgar, my
brother, the clutch, erm, the

00:08:36.916,00:08:41.087
er, I'll do a shout out in a
minute, sorry I didn't mean
to...Jeremy and Jane.., everyone

00:08:41.087,00:08:46.092
else. Oh wait, welcome Defcon
24, you guys seem a little
quiet, welcome to Defcon 24.

00:08:54.267,00:08:57.670
[audience applause, whistling].
So as we started talking about,
when I had my open letter of

00:08:57.670,00:09:03.243
apology to those I was trolling,
um, I'd like to finish that
letter with an announcement I

00:09:03.243,00:09:06.012
don't, that I didn't even tell
Jeff, and he's probably gonna
get mad at me for saying

00:09:06.012,00:09:11.851
this...But, um, I've decided
that because next year is Defcon
25, that for one last time I'm

00:09:11.851,00:09:15.388
gonna run a Mystery Challenge
and then I'm gonna put a nail in
that coffin and it's never going

00:09:15.388,00:09:21.528
to be resurrected again. So that
contest ran for five years, it
inspired, what spawned into the

00:09:21.528,00:09:26.633
badge challenge. How many people
here have actually competed in
Mystery Challenge before? So a

00:09:26.633,00:09:30.670
few. How many people are in the
badge challenge stuff because
you had read about the Mystery

00:09:30.670,00:09:36.042
Challenge stuff? So, so there's
a few. Mystery Challenge tends
to be a little more hard core.

00:09:36.042,00:09:39.612
It's a little more difficult,
badge challenge is meant to be
more accessible to everybody.

00:09:39.612,00:09:44.484
But I'd like to tell a little
story and that story is about
how the badge challenge

00:09:44.484,00:09:51.291
inspired, er, one, er, young man
to produce a tool which we will
be releasing here. Unfortunately

00:09:51.291,00:09:55.361
he is not able to be in
attendance and gave me
permission to release the tool,

00:09:55.361,00:10:00.366
er, vicariously in his stead. So
DC19, a guy Kevin Ewan who goes
by "Cryptic" who plays in the

00:10:03.002,00:10:08.174
badge challenge, he decided that
he was going to compete and he
was going to win the next year

00:10:08.174,00:10:12.712
and he joined a team, MOF I
think, that's Muppet Liberation
front I think is what that

00:10:12.712,00:10:18.985
stands for. So, Kevin noticed
that on the back of the Defcon
20 badge. For those of you who

00:10:18.985,00:10:24.090
don't know: if you win a black
badge competition at Defcon you
get an uber badge. Which is free

00:10:24.090,00:10:28.461
entrance into Defcon for the
rest of your life. But more than
that, everyone always talks

00:10:28.461,00:10:32.398
about that like it's some big
thing, okay it's a couple of
hundred bucks each year, really

00:10:32.398,00:10:36.135
it's the prestige. Because
there's so few of these are
given out, with we, with the

00:10:36.135,00:10:41.374
thousands of people we have
here, we'll give out ten, twelve
maybe a year. It's a...Jeff

00:10:41.374,00:10:46.946
makes that decision, but I like
to do a little thing on all of
these uber badges every year. I

00:10:46.946,00:10:51.551
place a cryptic graphic
challenge to see of the uber
people who received these

00:10:51.551,00:10:56.489
badges, who takes the time to
try and break the crypto that's
on the back of these each year.

00:10:56.489,00:11:02.295
And I get about a fifty percent
return. On the back of the
Defcon 20 badge is what most

00:11:02.295,00:11:08.668
people would know as an OTP. Who
knows what an OTP is? One time
pad. By many accounts, the only

00:11:08.668,00:11:12.939
unbreakable cypher. Technically,
if you handled the keys
correctly and everything else.

00:11:12.939,00:11:17.777
However, this was not an OTP. It
was what is known as a running
key cypher and the difference

00:11:17.777,00:11:22.782
between an OTP and a running key
is the fact that the the key, is
a chosen text. For example the

00:11:25.285,00:11:31.324
text , like the fifth chapter of
a book or a page in a magazine ,
or lyrics to a song, but

00:11:31.324,00:11:35.094
something. The reason for that
it makes passing the key easy
because I can send a text to

00:11:35.094,00:11:40.400
Jeff and say: "oh, just go open
War and Peace and turn to this
page and there's your key". But

00:11:40.400,00:11:44.971
in so doing, because your key,
because your your encryption
text and the text you're trying

00:11:44.971,00:11:49.809
to send are both from the same
language you've introduce a
weakness into that cypher. And

00:11:49.809,00:11:55.248
so Kevin went home and he
started working on a tool to
attack ARC CC and that method is

00:11:55.248,00:11:59.719
known as cribbing. While
cribbing on this particular
text, I actually tested for

00:11:59.719,00:12:04.490
that. It doesn't really work,
it's a real pain in the ass and
it doesn't produce good results.

00:12:04.490,00:12:08.127
But Kevin took it a step
further. He was just finishing
his degree, I believe, his

00:12:08.127,00:12:12.799
masters' and he realised it
wasn't good to just crib this so
he started doing natural

00:12:12.799,00:12:16.336
language processing. Um, this
stuff you might see when you do
predictive text when you're

00:12:16.336,00:12:20.974
typing, spell checkers, that
kinda thing. He started using an
ingram model to calculate

00:12:20.974,00:12:24.310
probabilities based on the
likelihood of events. For those
of you who know what's that's

00:12:24.310,00:12:29.115
called, it's a byte order mark
over assumption. So if you don't
know what that is, I suggest you

00:12:29.115,00:12:32.885
look it up, because it's
interesting and this is a hacker
conference, so go look that up.

00:12:32.885,00:12:38.257
So he took the hidden mark-up
change and the algorithm and
figured out a way to, in

00:12:38.257,00:12:43.262
software, do an attack against
running key cypher. And it
worked. That is the back of,

00:12:47.567,00:12:53.072
this is the uber badge from last
year. And then that's the crib
text that was on the back. Now,

00:12:53.072,00:12:59.579
Kevin and his guys had access to
that and here's a little side
story that's fun for you. When I

00:12:59.579,00:13:03.983
got out on the plane to go home,
Kevin happened to be on that
same plane, and I was up at the

00:13:03.983,00:13:08.621
front plane, he was sitting
further back and I saw him as we
got on the plane and he goes:

00:13:08.621,00:13:13.026
"I'll have that solved by the
time we get to the ground," and
I was like, there's no way, it's

00:13:13.026,00:13:16.796
running key, he only has his
laptop, he's not going to be
able to use cloud or anything

00:13:16.796,00:13:21.534
like that to crunch the cycles.
And when we got off the plane,
he walked over and shook my hand

00:13:21.534,00:13:25.705
and he handed me a napkin from
the airplane, I still have it,
and on that napkin was written a

00:13:25.705,00:13:32.245
solution. And he had solved it
because of his software. And he
has now given me permission to

00:13:32.245,00:13:37.617
give you guys the first attempt
at taking his code and approving
it, using it. He is releasing a

00:13:37.617,00:13:43.723
tool called: The RKCC, the
running key crypto cracker. And
you can get it at that address

00:13:43.723,00:13:49.062
up there right now he will have
it up on his site eventually.
And there's a beautiful write up

00:13:49.062,00:13:54.534
and blog post, but for me, this
is the the pinnacle of success
of what I tried to do with the

00:13:54.534,00:13:59.639
badge challenge is to try and
make people learn and grow and
now we have a new tool out of

00:13:59.639,00:14:05.845
it. So there we go. Give him a
hand, even though he's not here.
[applause] >>okay, so tha-that's

00:14:05.845,00:14:10.850
that bit of the story. So let
lets', oh and by the way I have
to comment about this badge.

00:14:15.988,00:14:20.827
This badge is actually not a
badge that I made, this badge
was presented to me right before

00:14:20.827,00:14:26.499
I came up on stage. This is the
forgery, and I would like you
all to see how good this forgery

00:14:26.499,00:14:31.504
actually is. [inaudible] So for
those who weren't here last year
and are curious, this badge

00:14:35.007,00:14:39.812
actually has several different
radio ACTi topes in it, like the
the glass is uranium doped and

00:14:39.812,00:14:44.784
we've got er, yellow cake and
other stuff and these are
lichtensphere etchings that I

00:14:44.784,00:14:50.623
had to source and I asked them
because I had contacted the guy
who was the last person in the

00:14:50.623,00:14:55.027
United Stated and I believed the
cunt in the world that makes the
lichten sphere etchings and I

00:14:55.027,00:14:59.832
asked: how did you get those
because I bought all of the ones
he had back, and they told me

00:14:59.832,00:15:05.071
he, I guess he came out of
retirement guys to make them for
you and then said he'll never

00:15:05.071,00:15:10.343
make anymore after that.
[laughter from the audience]. So
this is like one of the best

00:15:10.343,00:15:16.182
forgeries that I've seen now,
that being said, I know, Mickey
are you out there? Probably not.

00:15:16.182,00:15:21.354
Mickey who was here, also has a
fake, and I wanna compare the
fakes, so we'll have a battle of

00:15:21.354,00:15:25.992
the fake badges, that, anyway,
um, I was going to, where was I
going with that? Oh, this year's

00:15:25.992,00:15:30.997
badge. So what to you guys think
of this year's badge? [applause]
yeah. [applause, whistling]. So

00:15:34.934,00:15:41.107
I'm just gonna kill the screen
for now, sorry. Um, wha-what
you're wearing around your neck

00:15:41.107,00:15:46.913
is the product of many many
hours of blood, sweat and tears.
Not just from me. I could not do

00:15:46.913,00:15:52.385
this without a ring. The support
of Jeff and Will and all, all
the folks on the Defcon staff,

00:15:52.385,00:15:57.390
um, the support of Jeremy J, my
brother, everyone else. So for
all of the badges that you guys

00:15:57.390,00:16:02.829
see that are out there right
now, um the art work was
actually done by my wife, um,

00:16:02.829,00:16:09.669
and who is not in attendance and
the the layout I've also worked
with some gent- some people at

00:16:09.669,00:16:14.674
Intel, er, John are in the
audience? Are you out there?
Yeah, so back there. So, I

00:16:16.876,00:16:22.014
worked with John and some other
folk, so this this couldn't be
done without help of a lot of

00:16:22.014,00:16:26.285
people, so please give, just for
everyone who's had a hand in the
processes please give them a

00:16:26.285,00:16:31.290
hand. [applause]. I tried to,
er, make several other pieces of
the crypto=graphic challenge,

00:16:38.464,00:16:43.336
more like harder and fun, so
that those of you who are just
kinda casual, well you know the

00:16:43.336,00:16:47.907
casual gamer versus the hard
core. Like you may see some
little little glyphs on the the

00:16:47.907,00:16:52.078
signs out in the halls. They're
actually pretty easy to solve if
you take them in and start

00:16:52.078,00:16:56.215
thinking about them. You'll
notice there's text on your
lanyards, that's a puzzle.

00:16:56.215,00:16:59.318
You've seen some things. How
many of you have looked at the
map that's on the programme

00:16:59.318,00:17:05.124
that's on the second page? Yeah?
How many put that in[inaudible]
already? How many of you knew

00:17:05.124,00:17:10.863
there was XKCD comic that
referenced the tool that I used
to generate those equations?

00:17:10.863,00:17:16.102
Anybody, did anybody realise
that? How amazing is that,
right? Yeah, so if you don't

00:17:16.102,00:17:21.107
know about that, I'll post it on
a blog later. Um, there's stuff
on the back of the badges, um, I

00:17:23.309,00:17:28.915
really hope that that you enjoy
them. Wow, I apologize for some
of the er, some of the, when we

00:17:28.915,00:17:34.487
snap them out, some of the
contact points, um, maybe a
little bit of a pain in the butt

00:17:34.487,00:17:38.124
but we tried to move all the
components to the front because
we knew people in years past

00:17:38.124,00:17:41.861
with the electronic badges like
this one, didn't like the stuff
rubbing up against their shirt

00:17:41.861,00:17:45.598
and stuff like that, so we do
take these kinds of things into
consideration and if you have

00:17:45.598,00:17:50.036
suggestions or things, I am very
accessible. Send me and email,
say: "Hey, did you think about

00:17:50.036,00:17:53.839
this , or did you think about
doing this?" because this really
is a community effort and the

00:17:53.839,00:17:58.177
badges is for all of you guys.
And I hope that it's a nice
keepsake and thing for you to

00:17:58.177,00:18:03.616
take home. Now, that being said,
um we have something to show you
that we're only going to show

00:18:03.616,00:18:08.621
you a little bit of. Before I
show it to you, um, er, John and
Rick can you raise your hands?

00:18:11.090,00:18:16.228
John and Rick, they're they're
in the back, have actually, um
I've been working very closely

00:18:16.228,00:18:19.465
with them, I, did, these badges
would not have happened without
them. So when you look at this

00:18:19.465,00:18:23.436
whole thing and think: "Hey man,
it's a cool thing Ryan built
because I don't feel like this

00:18:23.436,00:18:28.641
this is a group effort,
especially, when it lay on the
shoulders of Rick. For those of

00:18:28.641,00:18:33.245
you that don't know, er, rick
and John both live in California
and deal with Hollywood and you

00:18:33.245,00:18:38.818
may know some of Rick's work
from things like in Jurassic
Park, the Spiderman movies and

00:18:38.818,00:18:43.823
and others. Rick do you wanna –
just stand up and wave.
[applause] so yeah, so so

00:18:49.362,00:18:54.433
anybody who's interested in like
professional level Hollywood
special effects, that's the guy

00:18:54.433,00:18:58.871
and Johnny Mac next to him is a
professional actor, lives in
Engineer as well. So Johnny

00:18:58.871,00:19:03.809
stand up and give a wave. You
may remember him? John was
actually our our, one year I had

00:19:06.512,00:19:11.584
a a hidden plant and knew John
was an actor so said: " John,
can you come and act like a spy

00:19:11.584,00:19:15.554
on the floor of Defcon?" And so
we did some dead drops and
things like that. So for the

00:19:15.554,00:19:20.159
first time, what I'd like to
show is a sneak peek and not
full functionality, because we

00:19:20.159,00:19:25.031
wanna, we wanna hide that from
you guys, of this year's uber
badge. So here's a look and I

00:19:25.031,00:19:30.036
got a camera right here. >>I'll
let you do the reveal. >>But
wait, there's more. >>More to

00:19:41.480,00:19:46.485
come. >>Yeah, yeah. So there's
some other stuff going on in
there. >>Just a little bit, so,

00:19:50.956,00:19:52.958
anyway, I'll show you from
profile. >>So good luck forging
these, guys. [laughter from the

00:19:52.958,00:19:56.862
audience] >>so any way >>It'll
only take them a year, they'll
do it, so, that's this year's

00:19:56.862,00:20:01.867
uber badge. [applause]. >>Tell
'em, tell 'em how they made, how
many they made, that kinda thing

00:20:19.151,00:20:24.023
[inaudible] >>I challenge you
with a 3D printer to reproduce
that. And come to closing

00:20:24.023,00:20:28.894
ceremonies and there might be
just a little bit extra, that
may have to do with those servos

00:20:28.894,00:20:34.900
in the back, right there.
Anyway, we hope you guys have a
good conference. Thank you for

00:20:34.900,00:20:39.839
coming out, I don't know if Jeff
has any other things that he
wants to say. Thank you all, and

00:20:39.839,00:20:44.743
if it wasn't for you guys and
for the guys that compete and
stuff, er, it's community, it's

00:20:44.743,00:20:49.482
the only reason I keep doing
this, it's a huge chunk, it's
all of my free time basically

00:20:49.482,00:20:54.954
and erm, I appreciate everybody,
so um this is what everybody
whose competing in a contest

00:20:54.954,00:20:59.058
this year is fighting for, is
they want to wear and this is
actually a badge. >>Action on

00:20:59.058,00:21:05.865
the back and you can wear it and
be like...[inaudible] [audience
laughs] >>So, um, I wanna just

00:21:05.865,00:21:10.803
leave you with one thought. And
this is, er, we say it every
year so it can sound repetitive

00:21:10.803,00:21:15.474
but that doesn't mean it's any
less important. And that's just
that we say you you get out of

00:21:15.474,00:21:20.679
Defcon what you put into it. Um,
it really is what you make of it
and the conference has gotten so

00:21:20.679,00:21:27.219
large that um I always assume
that there's like a natural
filtration mechanism. There's

00:21:27.219,00:21:32.224
just not that many people that
wanna get on an airplane, go to
Las Vegas in the summer, um

00:21:32.224,00:21:37.029
spend all that money and at some
point we'll just reach that
threshold. And that's it, that's

00:21:37.029,00:21:41.133
how many people are interested.
And every year there's more and
more at conferences and infosec

00:21:41.133,00:21:45.070
conferences and hacking
conferences and so there'll be
more regional opportunities and

00:21:45.070,00:21:51.744
there'll just be less, er.
reason for you to come to Vegas.
But then every year, the

00:21:51.744,00:21:56.749
convention grows. And so I don't
know why my nose is on the
screen right now [laughter from

00:21:56.749,00:22:01.687
the audience] er [laughs] and so
er, [laughs] it's a very nice
nose, I like it very much, but I

00:22:11.063,00:22:17.269
don't want to share it with
everybody. Um, so, so I'm always
astounded there's so many people

00:22:17.269,00:22:20.906
coming in and what are they
getting out of it? I'm trying to
ask people and some people say:

00:22:20.906,00:22:25.411
"I'm only here for the people, I
don't go to any talks," and
other people say: "I only go to

00:22:25.411,00:22:28.614
the talks, I'm not here for the
people", "I'm only here for the
music and supporting my friends

00:22:28.614,00:22:32.618
who are competing in this
contest" and what I quickly
found is that there are so many

00:22:32.618,00:22:39.091
things going on, there's so many
interests, um, that you can
never hope to understand. It's

00:22:39.091,00:22:42.962
larger than a person, it's
larger than a group of people.
There's a lot of divergent

00:22:42.962,00:22:47.132
interests, but we all sort of
have this desire to learn, we
all have this certain common,

00:22:47.132,00:22:53.973
er, themes. And so, that's the
themes I try to work on and so
we work really hard to try and

00:22:53.973,00:22:58.177
figure ways to get you kind of
split into smaller groups so
that you can meet each other. We

00:22:58.177,00:23:04.717
bought, we bought a hundred bean
bags and we're gonna put them in
the chill out areas and I know

00:23:04.717,00:23:08.988
the bean bags are going to get
stolen [laughter] because, I
mean, who wouldn't want to

00:23:08.988,00:23:14.393
steal, I think we already
stopped some of our staff from
stealing 'em. [laughter from the

00:23:14.393,00:23:19.265
audience] so, um, so why would
we do that? Well, okay, first of
all, if you steal a bean bag and

00:23:19.265,00:23:23.802
we catch you, you're probably
gonna get kicked out. But if you
steal a bean bag and get away

00:23:23.802,00:23:28.807
with it, I want pictures, right?
[laughter] so, there's a little
bit of a tension there, right? I

00:23:30.876,00:23:34.146
wanna see it on Twitter, I wanna
see these bean bags traveling
the world...actually I don't

00:23:34.146,00:23:37.082
because you're not gonna get
away with stealing any because
we're gonna be that good at

00:23:37.082,00:23:43.289
stopping you. Um, so, what I
wanna be able to bring, is
there's this kinda fun tension

00:23:43.289,00:23:48.394
here and it is what you make of
it and I really just encourage
you: go up and say hi to people.

00:23:48.394,00:23:52.264
Um, and if you run into somebody
with a big ego, guess what?
There's plenty of other people

00:23:52.264,00:23:57.136
without big egos. I mean, "Lost"
is super approachable. I'm
approachable. Everybody is here

00:23:57.136,00:24:00.539
to get something out of it. To
learn, to make new connections
and so, I just really want to

00:24:00.539,00:24:04.343
encourage you. It's your first
year, you might be a little
intimidated by the size, because

00:24:04.343,00:24:09.148
as you've seen there's a lot of
other people that are here for
the first time and you can go to

00:24:09.148,00:24:13.585
the parties and er, you can just
talk to somebody and chances
are, they'll talk back. And

00:24:13.585,00:24:18.957
we've got it right here, at the
end of the hallway, Napoleon's
piano bar, we've got that open

00:24:18.957,00:24:23.562
only for us, you should have a
badge to go in there. But, it's
like one of our chill out areas

00:24:23.562,00:24:29.835
as close to this space as
possible and we just want you to
have ways of spontaneous sort of

00:24:29.835,00:24:35.107
discovery. We want you to have
like an "ah-ha" moment
[inaudible] yeah in his room we

00:24:35.107,00:24:39.578
took er, Nikita took all of her
party favours and decorated the
1057 room , sort of like a

00:24:39.578,00:24:45.984
really creepy, like party room
slash couches slash super smart
people competing on his contest.

00:24:45.984,00:24:50.155
Um, just stop by and say hi. And
with that, I'm not gonna keep
talking, but I wanna let you

00:24:50.155,00:24:56.962
guys get out a little bit early
so you have a jump on everybody
else, um but have fun, I'll see

00:24:56.962,00:25:00.499
you at the closing ceremonies
and don't forget the party
tonight. We have a live bands,

00:25:00.499,00:25:06.705
it's like 8 to 2 in the morning,
tonight and tomorrow night. Oh,
you wanna give out some

00:25:06.705,00:25:11.243
super...okay if you haven't
caught on, there's five
different kinds of lanyards that

00:25:11.243,00:25:16.949
relate to the contest. Four
kinds of the lanyards are really
common, the fifth magical

00:25:16.949,00:25:21.954
lanyard that I'm wearing is
white, um, they were only made
500 out of like 20 000, and so

00:25:24.490,00:25:27.826
we have some and we gonna throw
'em in the audience and
hopefully people are competing

00:25:27.826,00:25:30.496
in the contest are now going to
have to have hassle you and
they're going to have a reason

00:25:30.496,00:25:34.099
to talk to you, so you could
just be like: "Well, I'm not
going to let you see the lanyard

00:25:34.099,00:25:39.104
unless you tell me your dog's
name" or some social opener
that's not as awkward as that

00:25:46.245,00:25:50.616
[laughter and noise]. Okay, so
we're gonna toss these out, and
we'll have, we'll see you around

00:25:50.616,00:25:52.918
the con. Have a good con
everybody! Thank you. [applause]
