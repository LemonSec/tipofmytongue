00:00:00.167-->00:00:05.172
>> Aah, next up we have Dr. Paul
Vixie and I will remind you
before he speaks, ummm as you're

00:00:05.172-->00:00:09.076
coming in on the left side,
ummm, when the talks done, make
sure when you exit out, ummm,

00:00:09.076-->00:00:13.914
exit out your left side or stage
right go out those back doors or
the side doors here and we kinda

00:00:13.914-->00:00:18.185
keep the flow going through when
you're done So I'd like to
present Dr. Paul Vixie

00:00:23.123-->00:00:28.128
[clapping] >> Thank you very
much, thank you for inviting me
Ummm, we have been doing some

00:00:30.664-->00:00:36.036
science fair project work at my
day job And we have some
intermediate results that I

00:00:36.036-->00:00:40.974
thought would be interesting to
this crowd and the programming
committee agrees So let us

00:00:40.974-->00:00:45.979
begin. Ummm, front-runners are
people who are grabbing things,
uh, that may be valuable to

00:00:48.949-->00:00:54.054
others for the purpose of either
hoarding them to drive up the
price of other things or uh just

00:00:54.054-->00:00:58.725
keeping them so that you have to
pay them essentially ransom to
get it. I was a member of the

00:00:58.725-->00:01:02.896
ICANN security and stability
committee when we published this
report because there was an

00:01:02.896-->00:01:07.501
awful lot of front-running in
form of domain grabbing People
were grabbing domain names for

00:01:07.501-->00:01:13.540
reasons other than uh using them
and uh we thought that was a
security and stability problem

00:01:13.540-->00:01:18.545
and uh wrote a report. uh one of
the ways that this manifested
was in tasting domain tasting it

00:01:21.148-->00:01:27.054
used to be possible within
certain limits for some
registrant to grab a domain

00:01:27.054-->00:01:33.627
name, keep it for three days and
then return it without owing any
money uh as I said it's within

00:01:33.627-->00:01:38.999
limits they had some things they
couldn't do too many per day and
they had to pay for some other

00:01:38.999-->00:01:44.237
number of them and so forth it
was basically it was a loop hole
by which a small number of

00:01:44.237-->00:01:50.944
people were keeping a whole
large number of domain names uh
because you could grab the same

00:01:50.944-->00:01:56.249
one seventy three hours later
and uh anyway that was all shut
down ICANN finally did something

00:01:56.249-->00:02:01.688
they realised uh that this was
bad for the world and as a 501C3
public charity they thought that

00:02:01.688-->00:02:07.094
they should help the world in
that way so they got rid of
domain tasting uh that does not

00:02:07.094-->00:02:12.099
mean that front-running has gone
away so we are a passive DNS
company uh at the moment we have

00:02:16.370-->00:02:20.807
a lot of other data sources but
we're known for passive DNS and
we have a lot of real-time data

00:02:20.807-->00:02:26.947
and we thought we would take a
look at whether the real-time
information flowing through the

00:02:26.947-->00:02:31.952
DNS could be of help to somebody
who wanted to uh acquire domain
names for the purpose of selling

00:02:34.421-->00:02:39.926
it later or maybe collecting
traffic because of
typo-squatting or whatever ummm

00:02:39.926-->00:02:45.699
now most of what we do focuses
on things that exist but we do
have a channel that uh just

00:02:45.699-->00:02:51.838
talks about obversations of
non-existance which is called
NXDOMAIN in the uh in the DNS

00:02:51.838-->00:02:57.611
field ummm and so although we
don't have a database for that
we do have very good real-time

00:02:57.611-->00:03:04.051
flows so this turned out to be
kind of a good way to use our
position of observability in the

00:03:04.051-->00:03:09.489
industry to uh figure out
whether this was a problem that
we could then bring to the

00:03:09.489-->00:03:14.494
attention of ICANN and others
ummm we are not concerned about
people who are amateurs at this

00:03:17.497-->00:03:23.136
if you think of a cool name of a
cool domain name when you're
taking a shower or driving on

00:03:23.136-->00:03:28.141
your commute and you go register
that you're not going to cause a
problem for anybody ummm there

00:03:28.141-->00:03:33.914
was a chance to do that thirty
years ago whoever registered
scuba.com probably later sold it

00:03:33.914-->00:03:39.119
for millions and I can tell you
that the guy who registered
altavista.com did in fact sell

00:03:39.119-->00:03:44.357
it for millions to DEC when they
had a search engine by that name
but we're not worried about that

00:03:44.357-->00:03:50.530
ummm because it's by definition
not scaling but the
professionals who are working at

00:03:50.530-->00:03:57.170
scale uh are really getting in
the way it's inevitable now that
when you start a company that

00:03:57.170-->00:04:03.643
one of the things you test for
is can I get the dot com name if
you can't get the dot com name

00:04:03.643-->00:04:08.949
chances are you will not choose
that name for your company or
your product uh which means

00:04:08.949-->00:04:13.820
these name are very powerful
they are as powerful as if an
international trademark would be

00:04:13.820-->00:04:20.227
if such a thing existed and umm
wherever there is money to be
made you'll find people looking

00:04:20.227-->00:04:26.533
for loopholes that will allow
some of that money to flow their
way and umm I think we have to

00:04:26.533-->00:04:32.539
pay attention to that I think
that the DNS should really be
available for people who want to

00:04:32.539-->00:04:38.044
add value to the Internet rather
than adding money to their bank
account as their first act I'm

00:04:38.044-->00:04:44.818
happy to do well by doing good,
but doing well at the expense of
others is a problem Sorry if I'm

00:04:44.818-->00:04:50.157
going a little fast for ya I
have 50 slides this is a one
hour talk I have 20 minutes to

00:04:50.157-->00:04:55.162
do it in ummm so ummm we don't
sell the NXDOMAIN feed to
spammers or domainers and uhh

00:05:01.168-->00:05:07.274
that does not just reflect my
own ethical concerns about it
it's a very practical concern uh

00:05:07.274-->00:05:13.079
we have 200 thousand cache miss
transactions coming to us every
second and these are from

00:05:13.079-->00:05:18.151
customers who operate a sensor
for us in exchange for a
discount on commercial services

00:05:18.151-->00:05:23.156
umm and they could if they saw
us doing evil with their feed,
uh stop sending us that data so

00:05:26.893-->00:05:31.731
we're under contract and that
contract could be terminated
they could choose to either stop

00:05:31.731-->00:05:37.304
using our commercial services or
to stop getting a discount on
them which means I have to be

00:05:37.304-->00:05:42.609
extremely careful with what we
allow their data as it flows
through our system to then be

00:05:42.609-->00:05:47.180
allowed to do and a couple of
them are ethically very
concerned about things like

00:05:47.180-->00:05:52.252
front-running things like
domaining. That's why we have a
fairly long contracting process

00:05:52.252-->00:05:56.756
when people want to buy data
from us will end up sitting with
a fairly senior person at

00:05:56.756-->00:06:01.561
Farsight and describing their
intended use and signing a
contract indicating that and

00:06:01.561-->00:06:06.700
only that will be the use thay
make of our data and if we later
find that they made other uses

00:06:06.700-->00:06:11.738
then they're gonna discover that
the contract has teeth. So as
you listen to this please

00:06:11.738-->00:06:16.876
understsand that we dont do
surveillance and we don't help
spammers even though we have a

00:06:16.876-->00:06:21.881
very good observation framework
within those constraints. So
again this is a science fair

00:06:25.552-->00:06:31.124
project and I'll tell you what
our hypothesis was. We thought
that there would be somebody out

00:06:31.124-->00:06:36.429
there who could see NXDOMAIN
traffic although probably not
from us because as I said we

00:06:36.429-->00:06:42.469
wouldn't sell to them, but we're
not the only game in town and a
lot of other isps and so forth

00:06:42.469-->00:06:47.307
are data-mining everything they
can because they're engaged in a
race to the bottom on the

00:06:47.307-->00:06:52.312
margins on their primary product
and so they're all giving an eye
towards social networking

00:06:55.482-->00:07:00.420
basically selling your PII as an
additional revenue source for
them and ummm so we thought are

00:07:03.790-->00:07:09.329
there people looking for
typo-squatting are they
registering domains that are one

00:07:09.329-->00:07:14.734
letter or in some cases one bit
off of some existing name for
the purpose of catching nearby

00:07:14.734-->00:07:19.739
traffic umm or are they looking
for permutations uhh in Vietnam
we called this recon by fire:

00:07:21.975-->00:07:28.448
shoot a machine gun into the
forest and see if anybody yells
ummm and uh we looked at various

00:07:28.448-->00:07:35.455
thing like hamming distance and
whatnot to find what nearby
meant in the context of nearby

00:07:35.455-->00:07:40.460
domain names we have of course I
mentioned we have a passive DNS
database and that's what we're

00:07:42.495-->00:07:46.833
most known for but it's built on
the realtime foundation called
the security information

00:07:46.833-->00:07:51.838
exchange and umm we're seeing
maybe 700 megabits a second of
real-time data which about half

00:07:54.007-->00:07:59.813
is DNS the other half is random
other stuff like spam ummm and
that is the foundation of our

00:07:59.813-->00:08:05.752
passive DNS database so although
the database pays the bills the
real time exchange is the source

00:08:05.752-->00:08:12.225
of the data that we used for
this science fair experiment and
umm I wanna mention that if you

00:08:12.225-->00:08:18.498
are out there doing good uhh by
our definition and you're not
charging a fee for it, you

00:08:18.498-->00:08:22.836
probably qualify for a free
grant of our services, whether
the good you're doing is

00:08:22.836-->00:08:28.508
generating chapters for your
masters thesis or whether you're
an internet superhero it doesn't

00:08:28.508-->00:08:35.482
matter to us uhh so please do
talk to us about that, we're not
just a commercial company ummm

00:08:35.482-->00:08:40.687
so we looked at NXDOMAIN data,
we looked at newly observed
data, we have a channel for each

00:08:40.687-->00:08:46.793
one uhh I've just gotten my 5
minute warning believe it or not
so uhh I can't go through these

00:08:46.793-->00:08:52.031
in as much detail as I'd like
but they will be available
online, and of course you all

00:08:52.031-->00:08:56.736
apparently have my email address
please use it This is what it
looks like on the nxdomain

00:08:56.736-->00:09:03.510
channel broken out into ascii So
you can see the delegation point
there at the end ummm, that

00:09:03.510-->00:09:07.847
delegation point nflixvideo.net
is what you would have to
register so that's what concerns

00:09:07.847-->00:09:12.852
us and the expression of
negativity is below that ip 41.0
etc is what didn't exist

00:09:15.321-->00:09:20.326
nflixvideo.net very much did
exist ummm you can see that on
whois it belongs to netflix the

00:09:22.429-->00:09:26.499
other channel we have is newly
observed they look like this and
you're just seeing the domain

00:09:26.499-->00:09:31.504
startjobs.xyz in this case so
ummm, these are in vastly
different volume scales, some

00:09:34.441-->00:09:40.380
5000 increments on the top and 2
million on the bottom so you're
seeing a lot more NXDOMAIN

00:09:40.380-->00:09:45.385
traffic than you're seeing the
uh newly observed domains uhh,
the stuff that you see as the

00:09:48.121-->00:09:53.026
parent of the things that don't
exist is what you'd expect a lot
of people look for non-existant

00:09:53.026-->00:09:58.031
ip6.int or non-existent
spamhaus.org subdomains ummm we
filtered we did all kinds of

00:10:00.133-->00:10:06.172
stuff umm, a lot of junk, huge
amounts of junk bad characters
that make it into DNS that

00:10:06.172-->00:10:11.177
shouldn't they're just buggy
libraries and buggy applications
ummm and what do we find, this

00:10:15.114-->00:10:20.119
is what I really wanted to get
to so I'll use my last minute
for that ummm, so there wasnt' a

00:10:22.122-->00:10:28.328
huge amount of evidence that
NXDOMAIN correlates to newly
observed domains and we think

00:10:28.328-->00:10:33.566
that we can uhh hone this down
by doing different science using
slightly different data and

00:10:33.566-->00:10:39.072
filtering it out in different
ways so we did learn some things
but we're skipping the slides

00:10:39.072-->00:10:43.610
that tell you what we learned
but ultimately there were only
181 cross-overs where something

00:10:43.610-->00:10:48.414
was negative before it was
positive and out of the size of
the data set we have lasting a

00:10:48.414-->00:10:54.721
week that could easily be
completely reasonable people
that are just registering stuff

00:10:54.721-->00:11:01.494
that they uhh they do plan to
use so in other words at the
moment we have no evidence that

00:11:01.494-->00:11:07.166
the bad guys are using NXDOMAIN
to drive their operations as to
whether they should I'll leave

00:11:07.166-->00:11:12.171
that to them to decide If they
do we'll be watching Ummm,
there's a huge amount of other

00:11:14.774-->00:11:19.779
crud I wanted to let you know it
turns out NXDOMAINs is a great
source of DGA intelligence:

00:11:23.116-->00:11:29.055
Domain Generation Algoritm.
Bot-nets that are using the DNS
in order to find their Command

00:11:29.055-->00:11:35.328
and Control use these gibberish
domain names that are computed
based on the current time of day

00:11:35.328-->00:11:39.199
in order to decide where their
Command and Control are going to
be so you as the owner of the

00:11:39.199-->00:11:44.637
botnet need only register one of
the ones that your botnet is
going to be using tomorrow and

00:11:44.637-->00:11:49.976
then tomorrow you'll be able to
send it commands, but all of
them have to do lookups for all

00:11:49.976-->00:11:54.714
of the names that might be used
for tomorrow and so NXDOMAIN as
a data-source this is something

00:11:54.714-->00:12:00.887
Damballa, David Beggin's team at
Georgia Tech told us 10 years
ago and I thought that perhaps

00:12:00.887-->00:12:05.992
that would mean that we would
have dealt with it by now, but
no according to our uh our data

00:12:05.992-->00:12:10.997
this is very much real so my
conclusion is, umm well, my
conclusion way down at the other

00:12:16.235-->00:12:20.206
way, excuse me one more thing
I'm going to go over time
they're gonna kill me now Paypal

00:12:20.206-->00:12:25.945
has a problem, ummm, these are
all things that had payp
somewhere in their names, and

00:12:25.945-->00:12:31.651
umm, you know Paypal is one of
my partners so I've already
informed them of this, but every

00:12:31.651-->00:12:37.690
domain holder, every trademark
holder has a problem like this
one and you're gonna find these

00:12:37.690-->00:12:43.162
often in the NXDOMAIN first
bceause they will be doing
reconnaisance to see if this

00:12:43.162-->00:12:48.167
exists before they try and
register it umm and again this
is just one trademark, so, ummm,

00:12:51.971-->00:12:57.910
yeah here we go, way to many uh,
slides there, anyway, ummm, my
hope is that NXDOMAIN traffic

00:12:57.910-->00:13:02.682
uhh is going to be the next big
data-mining oppportunity, and my
hope is that uh we will somehow

00:13:02.682-->00:13:07.687
keep that data-mining from
happening on the dark side of
the economy and uh if you are

00:13:12.425-->00:13:17.397
interested in doing sceince for
which you do not charge a fee
you can get a NXDOMAIN feed in

00:13:17.397-->00:13:22.468
real-time from us but whatever
you do I hope you will at least
give some consideration to

00:13:22.468-->00:13:26.572
things that don't exist and the
implications of that
non-existence on your your

00:13:26.572-->00:13:31.577
security and the security of the
Internet thank you, do I have a
minute for questions? ok

00:13:51.664-->00:13:56.669
[clapping] >> [inaudible] >>
just scream it out >>
[inaudible] >> umm, to me it was

00:14:02.608-->00:14:09.248
the fact that non-existent names
that have a short hamming
distance from Paypal are being

00:14:09.248-->00:14:15.021
reconned. I assumed that people
would try to register these
things and use the you know "I'm

00:14:15.021-->00:14:18.558
sorry that name already exists"
as their signal that they
couldn't get it but they're not

00:14:18.558-->00:14:23.563
they're doing reconnaisance
first >> [inaudible] >> umm, we
did not look at, you'd have to

00:14:30.436-->00:14:35.441
decode the IDN strings into uh
UTF or something and our level
of processing was command-line

00:14:38.778-->00:14:43.049
awk scripts for this so no we
did not look at any of the
international names for this

00:14:43.049-->00:14:49.155
study. I'll be back next year
for an update on this that has a
lot more detail >> [inaudible]

00:14:49.155-->00:14:54.627
>> ummm, no, the new gTLDs were
conspicuously absent from this
study, ummm, I wanna say as I

00:14:54.627-->00:15:00.800
usually do that the way that
most of us in this room first
become aware of the existence of

00:15:00.800-->00:15:05.805
a new gTLD is when we get
spammed by it. and so I was
expecting to see a fair amount

00:15:09.308-->00:15:14.313
of the bad behaviour happening
there but it's not and I think
it's either that the bad guys

00:15:21.020-->00:15:25.858
have other lower hanging fruit
and it's more profitable to
forget about that stuff or they

00:15:25.858-->00:15:30.329
realise that these new gTLDs are
very sparsely populated unilike
something like .de or .com and

00:15:33.266-->00:15:37.804
so there won't be very many
opportunities to sort of play
battle-ship in those spaces

00:15:37.804-->00:15:42.809
until and unless one of them
ever succeeds. >> [inaudible] >>
louder >> [inaudible] >> uhh

00:15:57.623-->00:16:04.030
that is true. if someone does a
registration event and then they
don't use the domain we will not

00:16:04.030-->00:16:08.734
see it in the newly observed
domain feed so when we're
looking for things that were

00:16:08.734-->00:16:15.241
first observed negatively and
then observed positively, so you
could bypass a study like ours

00:16:15.241-->00:16:20.780
by simply avoiding dns queries
and doing everything at the
registry level umm and we'll

00:16:20.780-->00:16:27.653
probably do a study there we
have three bulk whois providers
that we can use for that study,

00:16:27.653-->00:16:31.991
they're partners, umm and we'll
probably have an update on that
in the next version of this talk

00:16:38.130-->00:16:43.135
>> [inaudible] >> the question
is: how much whois information
is private and my answer is ummm

00:16:49.542-->00:16:55.081
I estimate that very little of
it is private, probably on the
order of 10 to 15%, uh because

00:16:55.081-->00:17:00.119
bad guys would rather use the
address that corresponds to the
stolen credit card they used to

00:17:00.119-->00:17:04.757
buy the domain because that will
help them get in the door in
case the whois information is

00:17:04.757-->00:17:09.762
used to validate the credit card
number. ummm, so really the
whois privacy tends mostly to be

00:17:11.764-->00:17:18.304
used by people who just don't
want to be spammed, rather than
by people who wanna do crime.

00:17:18.304-->00:17:22.975
That doesn't mean I love whois
privacy I'd like to see it go
away, but I don't think it's the

00:17:22.975-->00:17:27.980
problem that people are worried
about. Is that it? >>
[inaudible] >> How do you get

00:17:32.985-->00:17:39.425
the slides? >> [inaudible] >>
ummm, my email address is
vixie@fsi.io so you could send

00:17:39.425-->00:17:44.430
me mail or you could wait for it
to appear on the defcon website,
which it will inevitably do.

00:17:48.467-->00:17:51.671
Right, thank you [clapping]
