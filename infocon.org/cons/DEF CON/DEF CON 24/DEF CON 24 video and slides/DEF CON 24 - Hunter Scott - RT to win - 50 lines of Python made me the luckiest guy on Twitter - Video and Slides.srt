00:00:00.000,00:00:06.073
>>How many people like free
stuff? [cheering] Let's learn
how to get free stuff with

00:00:06.073,00:00:11.078
Twitter and Python let's give uh
let's give our next speaker a
big hand [applause] >>So have

00:00:16.817,00:00:21.521
you guys ever had an idea uh
that you tried and it worked
like a hundred times better than

00:00:21.521,00:00:28.028
you possibly could have hoped?
This is one of those ideas um if
I had to summarize this talk in

00:00:28.028,00:00:33.100
one slide it would be this uh
this is from the movie
[laughter] Real Genius if you've

00:00:33.100,00:00:38.105
never seen it, Val Kilmer, so
good. Uh so my name is Hunter
I'm a computer engineer and I

00:00:40.641,00:00:45.045
work for a startup in Silicon
Valley that you've never heard
of. Um so this started when I

00:00:45.045,00:00:50.517
was on Twitter and saw that
there's a bunch of contests and
and all you have to do to enter

00:00:50.517,00:00:55.722
them is retweet them I was like
well I can write a script to do
that. So I'm sure you guys have

00:00:55.722,00:01:01.595
all seen this comic it's the
XKCD where he writes a script to
buy something on Ebay every day

00:01:01.595,00:01:05.232
for one dollar with free
shipping the idea is that like
you get all these packages

00:01:05.232,00:01:08.368
showing up at your house and you
don't know what's in them and
that's super fun and it kind of

00:01:08.368,00:01:12.472
backfires on him because at the
end he gets put on an FBI watch
list because it buys all this

00:01:12.472,00:01:19.079
really suspicious stuff. So this
is kind of what I was going for
um and it basically worked

00:01:19.079,00:01:23.717
because it was actually better
because I didn't have to pay any
money um and as far as I know I

00:01:23.717,00:01:27.454
didn't end up on any watch lists
because of this particular
project but I'm you know you can

00:01:27.454,00:01:32.459
never be sure. Um so here's the
Twitter account that I set up um
you'll see that [laughter] I

00:01:35.429,00:01:40.934
really didn't try to be stealthy
at all um this is a default
picture from WIndows because I

00:01:40.934,00:01:45.405
was too lazy to google for
anything else and um it turns
out you don't have to be

00:01:45.405,00:01:50.444
stealthy and this seems to work
anyway which is kind of
interesting so how hard could it

00:01:50.444,00:01:55.449
possibly be? Um you look for
contests and then you retweet
them uh and then you're done so

00:01:57.751,00:02:01.822
I started with the terms you
might expect variance of
retweet2win and I was using the

00:02:01.822,00:02:06.960
Twitter API just twypi in Python
um unfortunately the Twitter API
has a bunch of rate limits in it

00:02:06.960,00:02:10.430
so this is kind of lame because
it means you have to add a bunch
of delays which means you can't

00:02:10.430,00:02:14.101
enter as many as you otherwise
would be able to. So the first
thing I did to get around this

00:02:14.101,00:02:19.673
was um rather than use the API
to search I just scraped the
Twitter search results page and

00:02:19.673,00:02:23.510
this works because you don't
have to be signed into use the
search page all you gotta do is

00:02:23.510,00:02:28.815
um make your request of whatever
search term you want as fast as
you want and then um use

00:02:28.815,00:02:33.420
Beautiful Soup to go through and
pull out all of the tweets that
look like contests and then I

00:02:33.420,00:02:37.958
stored their unique tweet ID so
I didn't have to check later to
see if I retweeted that 'cause

00:02:37.958,00:02:44.231
there's a lot of uh overlap
between search results. Uh as
you start doing this you'll

00:02:44.231,00:02:47.601
notice that there's a lot of
contests that require you to be
following the person to win so

00:02:47.601,00:02:51.772
this is a pretty easy
modification to make you just uh
rayex against it and see if they

00:02:51.772,00:02:56.109
ask you to follow and if they do
then you follow them. The
problem comes when uh you start

00:02:56.109,00:03:00.380
following about person number
two thousand because Twitter has
a limit that if you don't have

00:03:00.380,00:03:05.152
any followers or you have an-
under a threshold number that uh
you have to- you can't follow

00:03:05.152,00:03:09.256
more than two thousand people so
okay I need more followers so
what's the easiest way to get

00:03:09.256,00:03:14.261
more followers? Buy them. Um
this is [laughter] this is
Fiverr um and this here is

00:03:16.663,00:03:21.001
actually a bad deal, five
hundred followers for five
dollars um I paid five dollars

00:03:21.001,00:03:24.738
and I got about four thousand
followers um also I can
guarantee you that they are not

00:03:24.738,00:03:29.676
real Twitter followers um this
like- so this works okay um I
mean they- four thousand people

00:03:29.676,00:03:33.480
did actually show up which is
nice, unfortunately uh it's
pretty easy to tell that they

00:03:33.480,00:03:39.186
aren't real people, some of them
still had like the egg as their
profile picture and if you went

00:03:39.186,00:03:42.189
into any of their profiles it
was clear they aren't real
people and I'm sure if you did

00:03:42.189,00:03:45.325
any kind of network analysis you
would find that they were all
highly connected to each other.

00:03:45.325,00:03:51.098
Um so at this point, this is uh
the output of the script,
basically I'm just- I've

00:03:51.098,00:03:54.835
extended the number of search
terms now so I have quite a few
and by the end of this um I'm

00:03:54.835,00:03:58.438
fairly confident that I was
covering almost every single
contest that was launched on

00:03:58.438,00:04:02.976
Twitter um so this was a pretty
long list of search terms you
know you just kind of guess and

00:04:02.976,00:04:06.780
check to see what people use
when they're trying to launch a
contest so uh you go through the

00:04:06.780,00:04:10.984
search results e- looping
through each time and see okay
does this look like a contest?

00:04:10.984,00:04:14.654
If it does have we already
entered it? If not, then enter
it? Uh do we need to follow

00:04:14.654,00:04:18.458
them? Ha- are we already
following them, if we're not
then follow them. So to get

00:04:18.458,00:04:24.831
around the follower problem um I
just built a FIFO which is a
pretty obvious solution um it's

00:04:24.831,00:04:28.034
two thousand people long and so
whenever we need to follow
someone new we kick out the very

00:04:28.034,00:04:34.441
last person and pop on the new
first person and um this had a
couple I- well I got lucky in a

00:04:34.441,00:04:40.080
couple ways here, first of all
um it turns out that the length
of a contest is shorter than how

00:04:40.080,00:04:43.884
long it takes one name to
propagate all the way to the
bottom of the list which means I

00:04:43.884,00:04:47.721
basically was never unfollowing
someone too early, their contest
had already ended, the other way

00:04:47.721,00:04:51.858
I got lucky was the total number
of contests that were launched
on Twitter was low enough that I

00:04:51.858,00:04:55.829
was able to enter every single
one of them without hitting a-
uh any rate limits once I

00:04:55.829,00:05:00.901
implemented a few of these uh
tricks here and there was a side
effect here which is that I

00:05:00.901,00:05:05.305
guess it's some people when you
follow them they automatically
follow you back there's a lot of

00:05:05.305,00:05:08.542
bot activity on Twitter and
scripts and services and things.
I didn't realize how much there

00:05:08.542,00:05:12.946
was until I started interacting
with like thousands of these
things. But um the way it works

00:05:12.946,00:05:15.649
is like you'll follow them and
they'll say oh great thanks and
they'll automatically follow you

00:05:15.649,00:05:19.886
back, but then when you unfollow
them later, they don't unfollow
you back. So my follower count

00:05:19.886,00:05:24.391
started increasing with like
increasingly legitimate looking
accounts, companies, and people

00:05:24.391,00:05:29.496
and stuff that were running
these things um so I kinda got a
bonus there that I was- the

00:05:29.496,00:05:34.201
total number of people that I-
uh I was able to follow kept
going up as I did this. So then

00:05:34.201,00:05:37.504
I tried to figure out uh how I
could parallelize this and run
multiple accounts at the same

00:05:37.504,00:05:41.508
time um I should say that the
majority of the time that I was
running this I was actually only

00:05:41.508,00:05:47.714
using a single account but um if
you want to make multiple this
is what I tried to do so to use

00:05:47.714,00:05:51.384
the Twitter API you need a
developer account which means
you need a phone number and so I

00:05:51.384,00:05:54.654
need to get another phone number
okay I can use Google voice well
to activate Google Voice you

00:05:54.654,00:05:58.191
need a phone number okay so I
can use Tulio to make a phone
number to activate Google Voice

00:05:58.191,00:06:02.128
account to activate Twitter, you
can't use Tulio to activate
Twitter because Twitter somehow

00:06:02.128,00:06:05.632
knows you're using a Tulio
number and now i think even
google voice knows if you're

00:06:05.632,00:06:08.835
using a Tulio number, I don't
know how that works so if you
know how they're able to tell

00:06:08.835,00:06:13.506
that, let me know, 'cause it
really curious how that works.
Uh over the course of doing this

00:06:13.506,00:06:20.480
of course I had a lot of
interesting interactions with
the great Twitter public um

00:06:20.480,00:06:25.719
[laughter]. This was one uh that
I got busted on because this was
when I was running two bots and

00:06:25.719,00:06:31.057
um I had different Twitter
usernames but I forgot to change
the display name so person was

00:06:31.057,00:06:34.828
running an account- uh running a
contest and they were picking
multiple winners and I won

00:06:34.828,00:06:39.833
multiple of the wins [laughter]
um so uh yeah I I got busted
here and ditched this one um

00:06:43.937,00:06:47.941
another really great thing that
I liked about this was some of
the false positives I got some

00:06:47.941,00:06:53.146
things look like contests but
they're not. Um so this guy says
uh retweet for a chance to win

00:06:53.146,00:06:58.151
these Tupperware lids that have
been warped in the dishwasher
[laughter] must be following

00:07:01.655,00:07:07.427
[laugh] so dutifully my script
followed them and retweeted them
and uh it actually won the guy

00:07:07.427,00:07:12.432
DM'd me was like hey man you won
those warped tupperware lids I
was like yes! [laughter] It was

00:07:14.968,00:07:17.837
really disappointing though
because he never actually mailed
them to me, I was really hoping

00:07:17.837,00:07:23.643
he would mail them to me but he
never did. Um you get a lot of
weird interaction between other

00:07:23.643,00:07:27.447
bots when you do this kinda
stuff so this is an example
where someone is running some

00:07:27.447,00:07:31.818
kind of service that at the end
of the week on Friday they tweet
out the top five people who

00:07:31.818,00:07:35.789
retweeted you. So when you don't
have that many people that
retweet you but you do have a

00:07:35.789,00:07:40.560
bot following you that's
retweeting everything you tweet
about your contest and your

00:07:40.560,00:07:44.631
script is not checking to see if
those people are the same, then
you get all five slots, so.

00:07:44.631,00:07:46.633
[laughter] my best retweets came
from me and me and me and me and
me [laughter]. Uh you also get

00:07:46.633,00:07:51.638
asked for really weird stuff um
so the top one was someone- I
don't know if this was an- a

00:07:58.378,00:08:03.550
script or if it was like a
person copy and pasting but it
was some like teenage girl who

00:08:03.550,00:08:08.021
was trying to get people to
retweet to get the attention of
some like pop star she wanted to

00:08:08.021,00:08:13.226
ask on a date or something um so
the fact that I was sent this
makes me think that I don't know

00:08:13.226,00:08:16.663
maybe she- I'd like to think
that it's some like fourteen
year old girl slinging code

00:08:16.663,00:08:21.701
somewhere like trying to get a
date with this guy but I don't
know um the middle one like

00:08:21.701,00:08:28.041
super weird I don't understand
what this is um can you make it
to my party? April 27th seven pm

00:08:28.041,00:08:33.880
wear snow forts comma sleet like
I don't know if this is- they
seem like there may be some kind

00:08:33.880,00:08:38.885
of spam or a social engineering-
I don't know what these are but
uh they're almost certainly all

00:08:38.885,00:08:44.057
not real people um another in
the bottom one there is someone
who is promoting my account, I

00:08:44.057,00:08:50.764
have no clue why anyone would be
motivated to do that [laughter].
Uh this is a DM I got that I

00:08:50.764,00:08:56.102
thought initially it was someone
sent me like some ROT13 or
something [laughter] but uh no

00:08:56.102,00:09:01.041
this is just how the kids are
talking now so um and this was a
really good one this is uh

00:09:03.810,00:09:08.815
someone who's contest the prize
wasn't autographed by me
[laughter] what? So I don't

00:09:11.484,00:09:14.821
understand first of all how they
expected to pull this off, I
have no clue who this person is,

00:09:14.821,00:09:18.224
and I don't understand why
anyone would be motivated to win
an autograph by what is very

00:09:18.224,00:09:23.496
clearly a like account that is
only sending out contests um so
I couldn't figure out what the

00:09:23.496,00:09:28.868
motivation behind this one is
either but it was surprising to
run across. Sometimes my bot was

00:09:28.868,00:09:33.373
accidentally a jerk um like in
this case this is because of the
FIFO this person doesn't have a

00:09:33.373,00:09:38.778
lot of followers and they ran a
contest so I entered 'cause I
found it and then I didn't win

00:09:38.778,00:09:42.882
so they got pushed off the
bottom later they ran another
one so I followed them again and

00:09:42.882,00:09:45.618
like if you're a big company you
don't notice this kind of stuff
but if you're just like a person

00:09:45.618,00:09:50.490
they're like oh man can't
believe this person is only in
it for the contests [laughter]

00:09:50.490,00:09:55.495
so sorry man I don't know who
you are but. This is another one
of my favorites um it looks

00:09:58.098,00:10:03.103
exactly like a contest except
for you win absolutely nothing
um so I entered that one too

00:10:06.206,00:10:11.211
[laughter] only entry. Uh here's
one more false positive I
couldn't figure out why my bot

00:10:16.049,00:10:20.186
entered this, it's a list of
people's like favorite cereals
what? And I figured out I think

00:10:20.186,00:10:22.789
it's because of this word lucky
here, even though I wasn't
actually looking for just the

00:10:22.789,00:10:27.060
word lucky um for some reason it
picked it up the reason I was
showing you these false

00:10:27.060,00:10:31.498
positives is because I was not
trying to like hone in on any
particular contest or any

00:10:31.498,00:10:34.968
particular prize or anything
because I was able to enter
everything that I could find

00:10:34.968,00:10:40.740
like why not you know make your
filter wide open um you can't
lose a contest that doesn't

00:10:40.740,00:10:46.045
exist but you can lose a contest
that you don't find so here is a
list of stuff that actually got

00:10:46.045,00:10:51.050
shipped to my house and I should
point out that this is the stuff
that managed to ship which means

00:10:51.050,00:10:55.255
it's not the huge list of stuff
that wasn't physical and it's
not the list of stuff that uh

00:10:55.255,00:10:59.959
they wouldn't ship because I
lived in the United States and I
had won the prize in some other

00:10:59.959,00:11:06.599
country um so some of the uh
some items to point out here the
top thing there is a uh an

00:11:06.599,00:11:12.405
album, it's a vinyl, Papa Roach
um pretty great, bunch of books
and CDs most of which were

00:11:12.405,00:11:16.910
signed which is cool uh
t-shirts, a lot a like stuff you
would kinda get at like a career

00:11:16.910,00:11:22.949
fair you know glasses and pens
and stuff like that uh twelve
bottles of Cherry juice

00:11:22.949,00:11:29.055
[laughter] a uh calendar of 365
cats [laughter] and my favorite
physical thing that I got was

00:11:29.055,00:11:33.326
that cowboy hat over there,
because that is a cowboy hat
that is signed by the stars of a

00:11:33.326,00:11:35.628
Mexican soap opera that I have
never heard of before
[laughter][applause] The reason

00:11:43.970,00:11:49.375
I love it is because it's like
the perfect example of the
totally random stuff that showed

00:11:49.375,00:11:54.113
up at my door that I would never
have expected to get. Some
people like when I uh wrote

00:11:54.113,00:11:57.650
about this were saying hey you
know that's kind of lame because
maybe there was someone who like

00:11:57.650,00:12:01.854
was a huge fan of that Mexican
soap opera and like they didn't
get that thing and you did and

00:12:01.854,00:12:05.525
that's wasted on you and like I
understand where they're coming
from to some extent they're

00:12:05.525,00:12:08.761
right but I would say that I
have exactly the same amount of
appreciation if not more for

00:12:08.761,00:12:13.199
that thing than they do but for
a totally different reason
[laughter] so I think that's

00:12:13.199,00:12:18.171
okay. There's a lot of weird uh
intangible stuff I got too, Um
there was some restaurant in

00:12:18.171,00:12:22.342
England that I won reservations
to like thirty times in a row
couldn't figure out why they

00:12:22.342,00:12:28.281
weren't getting on to me um I
also won a uh there was some
like cam girl who had a contest

00:12:28.281,00:12:31.384
to win- she would write whatever
you wanted on her body in
chocolate sauce and take a

00:12:31.384,00:12:34.420
picture of it and send it to
you. So I won and so I'm trying
to think alright what can I have

00:12:34.420,00:12:39.959
her write so I try to get her to
write the Maxwell's equations
but [laughter] she didn't do it

00:12:39.959,00:12:45.632
it's kinda lame. Uh if you wanna
see the full list of stuff, this
is it, um there's a ton of stuff

00:12:45.632,00:12:49.168
on here that I didn't cover
because it's way too long but
it's fun to dig through there

00:12:49.168,00:12:55.942
there's uh some really random
stuff. Uh so towards the end I
uh tried to repurpose my bot for

00:12:55.942,00:13:01.881
good 'cause I noticed that there
were some tweets uh where you
would retweet to uh donate to

00:13:01.881,00:13:05.118
stuff people would say retweet
and I'll donate a dollar to some
charity I was like well I can

00:13:05.118,00:13:10.123
add that to the end of the list,
why not? So some people like
actually appreciated it and they

00:13:10.123,00:13:12.125
were like hey this is great
because I had real followers at
this point who were seeing it

00:13:12.125,00:13:17.130
but uh even this backfired at
the end unfortunately
[laughter]. Yep, retweeted that

00:13:25.338,00:13:32.278
one. [laughter] alright so the
the stats at the end here uh I
entered about a hundred and

00:13:32.278,00:13:38.017
sixty five thousand contests and
uh on average I won four
contests per day every day for

00:13:38.017,00:13:43.022
nine months straight [laughter]
um so this works [applause]. Uh
the most uh valuable thing that

00:13:52.231,00:13:57.070
I won was a four thousand dollar
trip to fashion week in New York
City uh I did not actually

00:13:57.070,00:14:00.573
redeem this prize because first
of all they didn't pay for
travel and I didn't live in New

00:14:00.573,00:14:03.876
York, second of all I wasn't
that interested in going to
fashion week anyway, and third

00:14:03.876,00:14:07.747
of all you have to pay taxes on
four thousand dollar prize which
I was not psyched about um if

00:14:07.747,00:14:11.417
you're not from the US you may
be surprised to learn that you
have to pay taxes on contest

00:14:11.417,00:14:16.122
winnings in the United States uh
and speaking of that, yes I paid
the taxes on the things that I

00:14:16.122,00:14:22.428
won. Uh I never released the
code for this in what may have
been a futile attempt to try to

00:14:22.428,00:14:28.801
stem the flow of Twitter contest
spam um but I wrote about it and
people made their own version

00:14:28.801,00:14:33.005
anyway so there's a whole bunch
on Github if you wanna look at
some um most of them are fairly

00:14:33.005,00:14:36.476
naive I still get emails
sometimes of people being like
hey man I tried to make a

00:14:36.476,00:14:42.415
version of that Python script
and I got banned immediately.
It's like yeah well so

00:14:42.415,00:14:45.918
[laughter] if you- if you look
through some of these there
there are some things that uh in

00:14:45.918,00:14:48.988
this talk that I don't think a
lot of them implement that you
can probably improve if you

00:14:48.988,00:14:53.993
wanted to. Um so if you want to
keep me from winning a contest
it's really simple um obviously

00:14:58.564,00:15:03.703
I was not trying to do this
stealthily and it turns out that
that didn't really matter so if

00:15:03.703,00:15:08.808
you're trying to prevent this
kind of people from winning then
all you gotta do is check to see

00:15:08.808,00:15:13.479
if the person looks very
obviously like a spam bot if you
would've gone to my page you

00:15:13.479,00:15:17.483
would've seen that it's tweeting
contests every thirty seconds
without sleeping ever it's

00:15:17.483,00:15:21.821
probably not a person um weirdly
there were versions of this that
I found I was looking before I

00:15:21.821,00:15:25.992
started to see if anyone had
tried this before and um I know
there was at least one or two

00:15:25.992,00:15:29.829
people who were doing an
extremely stealthy version of
this um and 'cause the only

00:15:29.829,00:15:36.402
reason I know is because he
emailed me and said like hey I
tried this too um and those it's

00:15:36.402,00:15:42.108
unlikely uh you would ever be
able to actually catch but um I
also saw some examples of what

00:15:42.108,00:15:46.579
looked like I don't know people
who were kind of doing this
manually they would sit at their

00:15:46.579,00:15:50.516
computer for like four or five
hour stretches and just like
literally do the exact same

00:15:50.516,00:15:56.122
thing and go through the search
results and just retweet retweet
retweet um so I guess it depends

00:15:56.122,00:16:01.460
how much you want uh how insane
you want your entrance to be
able to be to to be able to tell

00:16:01.460,00:16:05.364
the difference between a person
who spends four hours versus a
script um you could also try to

00:16:05.364,00:16:11.571
make it harder uh to
programmatically enter and you
can do this by adding a second

00:16:11.571,00:16:15.842
step like you know asking a
question or something this works
okay but it's not great because

00:16:15.842,00:16:20.680
um all you have to do because
everything on Twitter is public
is look to see what everyone

00:16:20.680,00:16:24.817
else is responding to this
question about and then just
repeat it um so this may stem

00:16:24.817,00:16:30.356
like some really innate attempts
and you could also try running
it on another platform um it

00:16:30.356,00:16:34.994
seems like it's more difficult
to make a legitimate looking
fake facebook account than it is

00:16:34.994,00:16:40.366
a fake Twitter account um and it
can also be tied to a real
identity which a Twitter account

00:16:40.366,00:16:46.038
obviously isn't um and finally
you just have to accept the fact
that if you're running a contest

00:16:46.038,00:16:49.308
people are going to try to game
it ever since people have been
running contests people have

00:16:49.308,00:16:54.113
been trying to game them and
that's kinda the way it's always
gonna be so that's just part of

00:16:54.113,00:17:00.786
doing it um so again here's the
list of stuff uh if you want to
look over it um and if you want

00:17:00.786,00:17:04.423
to follow me on Twitter I
guarantee it's one hundred
percent human generated content

00:17:04.423,00:17:09.428
um then that's my Twitter
username, thanks! [applause]
