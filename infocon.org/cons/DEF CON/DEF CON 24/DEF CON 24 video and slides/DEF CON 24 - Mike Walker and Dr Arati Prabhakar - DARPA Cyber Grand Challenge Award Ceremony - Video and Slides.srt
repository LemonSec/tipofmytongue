00:00:00.601-->00:00:06.807
>> Good morning and welcome to
the DARPA Cyber Grand Challenge
Award Ceremony. Please welcome

00:00:06.807-->00:00:13.647
the director of the information
innovation office at the Defense
Advanced Research Projects

00:00:13.647-->00:00:18.652
Agency Doctor John Launchbury.
[Introduction music] >>Good
morning. You know DARPA is a

00:00:29.796-->00:00:35.836
national treasure and a magical
place. It's filled with people
who have a vision of what might

00:00:35.836-->00:00:42.643
just be possible and the
technical chops to make it so.
They come from industry and

00:00:42.643-->00:00:48.949
academia and these people to
choose to commit 3 to 5 years of
their careers bringing new

00:00:48.949-->00:00:53.954
possibilities into being and the
nation entrusts them with the
resources to make it possible.

00:00:57.024-->00:01:03.697
Mike Walker is such a person.
Cyber Grand Challenge was his
vision of the possible and

00:01:03.697-->00:01:08.702
yesterday we all witnessed
something new being formed in
the world. This morning we get

00:01:10.704-->00:01:15.709
to celebrate that
accomplishment. Let us welcome
him to the stage, Mike Walker.

00:01:24.151-->00:01:29.156
[clapping] [applause]
[introduction music] >>Hello
everybody. Um in 2013 we

00:01:31.892-->00:01:36.630
challenged the world to create
automated systems that could
compete in hacking contest and

00:01:36.630-->00:01:42.336
no such machines existed at the
time. In 2014 competition teams
from around the world attempted

00:01:42.336-->00:01:46.940
to draw an existing program
analysis technology and native
code expertise to construct

00:01:46.940-->00:01:52.546
prototypes that could get us
halfway there. At our 2015
qualifiers 7 of these teams

00:01:52.546-->00:01:56.249
proved to the world the
automated flaw identification
and patching was possible in

00:01:56.249-->00:02:01.188
unison on on previously unseen
code. After we named our
finalists in July of 20 15 the

00:02:03.457-->00:02:07.527
race was on to take those core
skills and adapt them to
building a fully automated

00:02:07.527-->00:02:12.265
system that could think about
new security problems and manage
them under pressure in the heat

00:02:12.265-->00:02:17.537
of competition. Yesterday those
systems competed against each
other and let's watch a little

00:02:17.537-->00:02:21.208
bit of what happened together.
[sound effects] [inaudible
talking] >>ya absolutely

00:02:23.543-->00:02:28.548
[inaudible noise] >>Ready
>>Ready [inaudible noise] >>Game
started at oh 900 and 45 seconds

00:02:37.657-->00:02:43.363
Pacific. [music] >>Welcome
everyone to the first ever fully
automated cyber security

00:02:43.363-->00:02:48.468
automated competition. >>Xandra
managed to discover and prove a
vulnerability in one of the

00:02:48.468-->00:02:52.839
services we call opstem but this
is a unique situation and it's
something we were kind of hoping

00:02:52.839-->00:02:58.245
to see. They actually managed to
discover an unintended
vulnerability. So each a these

00:02:58.245-->00:03:02.282
uh each a these services that's
written just like real world
software it's impossible for us

00:03:02.282-->00:03:06.453
to have made absolutely certain
that the one vulnerability that
we intended is the only one

00:03:06.453-->00:03:10.390
that's present. So the
interesting part here is that
Zandra had discovered this new

00:03:10.390-->00:03:15.095
POV exercised it against
something that we hadn't
actually even intended and then

00:03:15.095-->00:03:20.767
JIMA observed this occurring and
successfully defended against
it. So these are all results

00:03:20.767-->00:03:24.538
that like we hadn't possibly
[audience applauding] had any
ability to predict what so ever.

00:03:24.538-->00:03:28.542
[applause] >>wow [applause] >>
So Zandra POV succeeded against
the reference binary but not

00:03:28.542-->00:03:32.479
against JIMA's patched binary.
[applause] >>So JIMA was
actually successfully able to

00:03:32.479-->00:03:36.983
patch a bug that we didn't even
know exists in the software but
what kind of general purpose or

00:03:36.983-->00:03:40.854
even specific patches does JIMA
implement that could do this.
>>So that was probably one of

00:03:40.854-->00:03:45.525
our uh general purpose patches.
We looked at areas of code where
we know there are common

00:03:45.525-->00:03:49.863
vulnerabilities and we just
deliberately inserted
conservatively the patches for

00:03:49.863-->00:03:53.567
those areas. >>The address
resolution service was basically
the vulnerability that was

00:03:53.567-->00:03:57.370
modeled after the sql slammer
like we were talking about and
we definitely saw some of the

00:03:57.370-->00:04:01.875
bots discover this vulnerability
and actually begin trying to
prove that vulnerability against

00:04:01.875-->00:04:07.380
other teams or other bots very
very early on. So this
represents uh a true success to

00:04:07.380-->00:04:11.485
ha- to what we have going on
here because in that 5 minute
window that Deb mentioned that

00:04:11.485-->00:04:16.356
she was hoping for that actually
managed to be proven and patched
by several of the teams in the

00:04:16.356-->00:04:21.128
very next round. So that means
that in a 5 minute window a
totally previously never seen

00:04:21.128-->00:04:26.600
before challenge binary was
researched and evaluated and
found vulnerable and patched by

00:04:26.600-->00:04:31.138
a completely autonomous system.
Our implementation of the mail
server challenge basically

00:04:31.138-->00:04:35.308
wanted to strike a balance
between the difficulty and the
complexity of the original bug

00:04:35.308-->00:04:40.547
in sendmail and Halvars example
that was sort of a carved down
sub set of the problem. Either

00:04:40.547-->00:04:45.685
way they are all sort of the
classic uh state machine
problems that are very very

00:04:45.685-->00:04:50.056
difficult for program analysis.
Those nearly infinite
possibilities and that halting

00:04:50.056-->00:04:56.029
problem that we talked about
before clearly come into play
here so MechaFish was the only

00:04:56.029-->00:05:01.401
team to actually successfully
POV against our version
[audience applause] [hollering]

00:05:01.401-->00:05:06.273
of crack adder. [applause] So
this basically represents a a
leap forward in program analysis

00:05:06.273-->00:05:10.777
for them to be capable of doing
this means that we're one step
closer to that thing that's

00:05:10.777-->00:05:15.282
basically been sort of thee
Everest of program analysis
because a that state machine

00:05:15.282-->00:05:18.451
problem. >>Uh congratulations so
what'd ya think about this?
>>[chuckles]It's pretty

00:05:18.451-->00:05:22.822
overwhelming >>right >>wow I
mean all the talk about state
machines and all the possibility

00:05:22.822-->00:05:26.393
of state machines really reminds
me of one of the papers we
published recently. We published

00:05:26.393-->00:05:31.298
paper driller which is supposed
to augment uh fuzzing with
symbolic execution and it's one

00:05:31.298-->00:05:35.835
of one of our really in depth
case studies talks about how
exactly it traverses the state

00:05:35.835-->00:05:41.174
machines and is able to really
explore deeply parts of the
program that would normally be

00:05:41.174-->00:05:47.480
inaccessible to a more naive
approach. [audience applause]
>>Thank you Ayshay [applause]

00:05:47.480-->00:05:53.119
>>Today we saw machines patch
many of the vulnerabilities that
were activated in their software

00:05:53.119-->00:05:58.124
within minutes without damaging
software or availability.
Challenges work not because the

00:06:00.093-->00:06:05.332
many who cannot imagine but
because of the few willing to
make the attempt. [inaudible

00:06:05.332-->00:06:11.371
background voices] Thank you all
for your courage. I'd like to
close [applause] but this room

00:06:11.371-->00:06:16.376
the loudest round of applause we
can summon for those who dare.
[applause] [hollering] >>So uh I

00:06:22.349-->00:06:26.286
have a a note on that first
highlight I just I wanna make
sure everyone understands what

00:06:26.286-->00:06:31.925
happened uh we created a bunch
of native code that had never
been seen before uh one of the

00:06:31.925-->00:06:36.229
machines found a bug in it that
we didn't know about. It was
completely unintentional

00:06:36.229-->00:06:40.934
discovered it discovered how to
use that flaw to take the flag
from another machine and the

00:06:40.934-->00:06:45.205
other machine detected it and
built a patch. A conversation
between machines that happened

00:06:45.205-->00:06:50.210
in minutes. Um who would've
thought. Um but what we just saw
yesterday was a first step I

00:06:53.913-->00:06:58.918
wanna think back for a moment to
2005. Uh this is Stanley.
Stanley's a self driving car

00:07:01.621-->00:07:06.626
that won the 2005 DARPA Grand
Challenge and Stanley is a
future technology prototype a

00:07:06.626-->00:07:12.599
proof of concept. A research in
engineering milestone. It is not
a particularly good self driving

00:07:12.599-->00:07:17.537
car by today's standards. It was
filled with computing it's
sensors in communications gear

00:07:17.537-->00:07:21.474
were bolted on and bulky. It
couldn't drive on our streets
and it couldn't handle traffic

00:07:21.474-->00:07:25.945
and it couldn't do a lot of
things. All the same Stanley
earned it's place in the

00:07:25.945-->00:07:31.551
Smithsonian by redefining what
was possible and today the
technology descended from

00:07:31.551-->00:07:36.222
Stanley and it's competition are
driving in America's streets all
on their own. That long awaited

00:07:36.222-->00:07:41.227
revolution is arriving on our
streets and highways right now.
So these CGC prototypes are just

00:07:43.797-->00:07:49.769
like Stanley they work only on
very simple research operating
system they work on 32 bit

00:07:49.769-->00:07:54.341
native code they spend a huge
amount of computing power to
think about the security

00:07:54.341-->00:07:59.946
problems of small example
services. The complex bugs they
found are impressive but they

00:07:59.946-->00:08:04.818
are not as complex as their real
world analogs and a huge amount
of engineering needs to be done

00:08:04.818-->00:08:11.358
before something like this can
guard the networks that we use.
I invite you this weekend to

00:08:11.358-->00:08:16.129
imagine the technology that will
follow these first prototypes
and what that technology will

00:08:16.129-->00:08:22.736
mean. Imagine networks where
zero day cannot happen to
anybody. Where it does not take

00:08:22.736-->00:08:27.540
gauren where zero day does not
guarantee attackers success
where defenders work together

00:08:27.540-->00:08:32.312
with guardian machines to keep
networks safe. Imagine getting a
text message from the system

00:08:32.312-->00:08:35.715
that protects your business
letting you know it just learned
about a new flaw in your

00:08:35.715-->00:08:42.021
document reader and synthesized
a new patch all on it's own.
It's coming and we have these 3

00:08:42.021-->00:08:47.027
days to imagine it together. Now
that cyber grand challenge is
over and since this is a

00:08:50.130-->00:08:55.702
security crowd I wanna talk a
little bit about some other
things at DARPA. Many of you may

00:08:55.702-->00:09:00.040
be familiar with the idea of
formal verification. A field in
which the security properties of

00:09:00.040-->00:09:04.811
native code are accompanied by a
mathematical proof that
guarantees those properties.

00:09:04.811-->00:09:09.282
Less of you may know that a few
years ago DARPA funded
technology uh that is now open

00:09:09.282-->00:09:14.788
source. A formally verified
control system for a commercial
quad copter and you can buy this

00:09:14.788-->00:09:20.293
commercial quad copter download
the code from the website on the
screen install it fly it around

00:09:20.293-->00:09:24.497
your neighborhood right now. The
research community behind this
code believes that formal

00:09:24.497-->00:09:30.437
verification provides powerful
promises about the absence of
entire classes of flaws and we'd

00:09:30.437-->00:09:35.208
love to hear from you about how
strong this security really is.
We also hope in the future to

00:09:35.208-->00:09:41.181
conquer new frontiers with
formal verification. Many of you
are also familiar with

00:09:41.181-->00:09:47.086
technology developed under cyber
fast track. Uh a previous DARPA
program. [audience applause]

00:09:47.086-->00:09:51.291
portions of end map for
instance. [applause] all of that
technology development happened

00:09:51.291-->00:09:56.095
because Mudge became the first
ke- person from this community
uh from this hacker community to

00:09:56.095-->00:10:01.267
come to DARPA to be a program
manager. I went to a lot of
Mudge's cyber fast track talks I

00:10:01.267-->00:10:05.805
was inspired by the common
ground that he forged between
DARPA and the hacker community

00:10:05.805-->00:10:11.377
and I'm proud today to be
following the tradition he
started and I hope that like me

00:10:11.377-->00:10:15.815
some of you out there are
watching what was accomplished
in this challenge and are

00:10:15.815-->00:10:20.653
wondering if you can build your
vision of future technology at
DARPA. Creating something like

00:10:20.653-->00:10:25.558
cyber fast track or cyber grand
challenge from scratch building
the technology team behind it

00:10:25.558-->00:10:31.831
and guiding its execution these
are difficult and rewarding
things. Mudge started a

00:10:31.831-->00:10:37.003
tradition of hacker program
management at DARPA and it is my
sincere hope that as my term en-

00:10:37.003-->00:10:42.642
ends and I leave the agency that
some of you will step up to
continue this tradition. Until

00:10:42.642-->00:10:47.881
it's easy to write defensible
code and networks are secure by
default there must always be

00:10:47.881-->00:10:54.854
hackers working at DARPA to
create revolutionary technology.
So if you have technology vision

00:10:54.854-->00:10:59.559
the ability to lead teams and an
aptitude for public service
please email us or seek us out

00:10:59.559-->00:11:04.497
this weekend. It is now my
pleasure to introduce the
director of DARPA Arati

00:11:11.271-->00:11:16.276
Prabhakar. [applause]
[introduction music] >>Thank you
Mike. Good morning everyone it's

00:11:20.747-->00:11:26.920
wonderful to be here with this
DEFCON community. I wanna take
just a minute and talk about why

00:11:26.920-->00:11:33.526
we are here why is DARPA here
doing the cyber grand challenge
and the first big reason that we

00:11:33.526-->00:11:36.629
are here is our job at DARPA is
to change what's possible aa
that's why everyone of us comes

00:11:36.629-->00:11:41.634
to work every single morning.
Our job is to change what's
possible so that we can

00:11:45.371-->00:11:51.377
revolutionize our national
security capabilities and our
little agency was created in the

00:11:51.377-->00:11:57.784
immediate aftermath of Sputnik
so we've been at this for bouts
almost 60 years now. And what

00:11:57.784-->00:12:03.690
that means is that our
predecessors got to work with
some of the most amazing people

00:12:03.690-->00:12:08.695
and teams of their times and the
work that they did together led
to navigation that you can hold

00:12:11.598-->00:12:17.604
in the palm of your hand it led
to stealth aircraft it led to
composite materials it led to

00:12:17.604-->00:12:23.910
wave after wave of artificial
intelligence and of course the
work that they did together

00:12:23.910-->00:12:28.915
built the arpanet and it led to
the internet. So
absolutely[laughter] [audience

00:12:33.486-->00:12:37.357
laughter] [speaker laughter] so
eh [applause] I I'm all for em
that was awesome what that

00:12:37.357-->00:12:44.130
generation did. For everyone of
us who works at DARPA today and
the community that we get to

00:12:44.130-->00:12:50.737
work with we recognize that
that's a proud history but now
now it's our time. Now it's our

00:12:50.737-->00:12:56.042
turn to step to the plate and
now it's our turn to change
what's possible and that is

00:12:56.042-->00:13:02.115
exactly what cyber grand
challenge is doing right now. So
eh uh you've heard about Mike's

00:13:02.115-->00:13:07.353
amazing uh work and talked he's
talked a little bit about the
big ambitions in the cyber grand

00:13:07.353-->00:13:12.358
challenge. Cyber grand challenge
is actually only 1 of about 200
active programs at DARPA today

00:13:14.594-->00:13:20.500
and everyone a those programs
has a big ambition. They range
from a ship that will be able to

00:13:20.500-->00:13:25.505
navigate itself across the seas
without a single sailor on board
to a spaceplane that can put a

00:13:27.907-->00:13:32.912
satellite on orbit tomorrow
instead of next year to a
network of sensors across an

00:13:35.415-->00:13:41.721
entire city that can detect
radiological and nuclear
materials before a terrorist can

00:13:41.721-->00:13:47.660
detonate a bomb and among the
things we're doing today I wanna
mention to where you can get an

00:13:47.660-->00:13:53.399
engaged immediately. Uh one you
can get engaged at noon today
right here at Defcon because if

00:13:53.399-->00:13:58.204
you go to the bio hacking
village you'll hear about some
of our big ambitions in

00:13:58.204-->00:14:03.676
biological technologies. The
work that we're doing to change
how we understand the human

00:14:03.676-->00:14:08.781
brain and start developing neuro
technologies. The work that
we're doing to build on the

00:14:08.781-->00:14:13.720
explosion in gene editing
capabilities and the work in
synthetic biologies so please

00:14:13.720-->00:14:18.057
join us there. You'll hear from
a couple of DARPA program
managers there. Uh a second

00:14:18.057-->00:14:23.563
thing that's a big ambition at
DARPA today a new program that's
just ramping up will be DARPA's

00:14:23.563-->00:14:29.235
next massive grand challenge and
that is the spectrum
collaboration challenge and I

00:14:29.235-->00:14:34.640
invite you to dive in on this
one too. The challenge in that
case is uh we're gonna challenge

00:14:34.640-->00:14:40.580
teams to build radio networks
with embedded API's that will
allow each of those radio

00:14:40.580-->00:14:46.319
networks to dynamically scan and
form hypotheses and predict
what's happening in the radio

00:14:46.319-->00:14:52.558
spectrum so that they can both
compete with each other but also
collaborate to dramatically

00:14:52.558-->00:14:57.396
advance the amount a capacity we
can get from a fixed amount of
spectrum. That one's just

00:14:57.396-->00:15:03.069
getting rolling so dive back in.
So as you can see a very wide
range of big ambitions at DARPA

00:15:03.069-->00:15:08.074
today every single one of those
big ambitions depends on cyber
security. We can't achieve these

00:15:10.610-->00:15:16.916
big dream unless we can trust
our data trust our networks
trust the systems that we are so

00:15:16.916-->00:15:21.921
completely reliant on today and
because of that a revolution in
cyber security is also a big

00:15:24.123-->00:15:29.195
ambition at DARPA today. Cyber
grand challenge is a big part a
that. Mike mentioned some of the

00:15:29.195-->00:15:34.300
other things that we're doing.
There's a large portfolio of
active programs in that area

00:15:34.300-->00:15:40.373
results that are starting to
come out of it. We invite you to
engage with us and uh help build

00:15:40.373-->00:15:46.813
that portfolio but also draw on
the fruits of that research uh
because as we start developing

00:15:46.813-->00:15:51.751
those technologies and as we
start implementing them
ultimately we hope across the

00:15:51.751-->00:15:56.756
entire information ecosystem as
we do that we can start
imagining a future where we

00:15:59.258-->00:16:04.564
actually have some foundation of
cyber security not
invulnerability but we can live

00:16:04.564-->00:16:09.936
in a future where we can get on
with the business of enjoying
the fruits of this phenomenal

00:16:09.936-->00:16:16.409
information revolution that
we're all living in today. So
those are some of the big uh

00:16:16.409-->00:16:21.113
ambitions we have at DARPA today
and changing what's possible
what's possible is a very big

00:16:21.113-->00:16:26.185
reason that we are here today uh
at Defcon doing cyber grand
challenge. A question I've

00:16:26.185-->00:16:29.822
gotten from lots a people is why
are you doing this in Las Vegas
and why are you doing it with

00:16:29.822-->00:16:34.460
Defcon the answer to that is we
could not have done it without a
tremendous partnership with

00:16:34.460-->00:16:40.566
Defcon and I wanna just call out
uh Defcon's leadership this
whole community uh we chose to

00:16:40.566-->00:16:47.006
do this because number 1 uh how
awesome was it that we were able
with your permission to build on

00:16:47.006-->00:16:53.179
top of this amazing capture the
flag game. A perfect game to to
to start with to develop a

00:16:53.179-->00:16:58.851
league of their own for machines
to start learning how to do this
amazingly hard work. Um that's

00:16:58.851-->00:17:05.258
been wonderful for us uh most
important from my perspective
very much as Mike said this

00:17:05.258-->00:17:11.898
community your community you all
this is such an important uh
part of how we're gonna change

00:17:11.898-->00:17:16.736
the future of cyber security. I
think we're starting to build
some very important ties. I hope

00:17:16.736-->00:17:21.841
cyber grand challenge advanced
that in some very significant
ways. So thank you Defcon. This

00:17:21.841-->00:17:26.846
has been just tremendous.
[applause] The final most
fundamental reason we are here

00:17:34.186-->00:17:39.191
today is because of Mike Walker.
Uh now Mike is something amazing
and that amazing thing he is is

00:17:43.262-->00:17:49.902
a DARPA program manager. That's
a person who has a vision who
builds a team to do this

00:17:49.902-->00:17:56.175
[chuckles] incredible amount of
hard work who inspires a vast
community to drive these

00:17:56.175-->00:18:01.714
technologies forward and
ultimately it's someone who gets
to spark a technological

00:18:01.714-->00:18:06.786
revolution. So Mike thank you
for showing the world what a
DARPA [applause]program manager

00:18:06.786-->00:18:11.791
is all about. [loud applause] It
is now my privilege to recognize
the teams who built the bots who

00:18:23.803-->00:18:30.042
changed what's possible here at
the cyber grand challenge. We
are gonna start with finalist

00:18:30.042-->00:18:35.047
Dissect who built the bot Crispy
come on up. [applause][intro

before we bring up our next team

00:21:39.265-->00:21:43.769
uh to tell you that last night's
remind you that last nights
results were provisional. That

00:21:43.769-->00:21:49.508
we run uh scoring inside the air
gap scoring outside the airgap
we wait until those 2 results

00:21:49.508-->00:21:53.846
agree and we are still working.
There is a team working right
now to run another verification

00:21:53.846-->00:21:58.551
round outside and that means
that while we can name a second
place and we can name first

00:21:58.551-->00:22:03.489
place third place is pending
verification. So with that we're
gonna announce another finalist.
