1
00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:09,928
yeah

2
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:17,060
las vegas 2015 hackers gather at DEFCON
to play capture the flag

3
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:22,250
the game of choice for cyber security
experts to train and test their skills

4
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:26,630
it was here that DARPA program manager
Mike Walker announced the plans for the

5
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:31,040
cyber grand challenge final event how
enormously hard this game is that

6
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:33,800
they're going to try and play and why
it's so important

7
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:37,099
the CGC final event is historic

8
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:41,719
it will be an all computer cyber defense
tournament no humans allowed the first

9
00:00:41,719 --> 00:00:42,950
of its kind

10
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:48,860
the defense advanced research projects
agency darpa is hosting the challenge to

11
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:53,510
stimulate development of autonomy and
cybersecurity the computers the cyber

12
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:54,710
reasoning systems

13
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:59,899
the teams will program will compete in a
3.75 million-dollar prize pool with a

14
00:00:59,899 --> 00:01:05,030
two-million-dollar grand prize on August
fourth 2016 at the paris hotel here in

15
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:11,149
Las Vegas the computers will compete in
a game of capture the flag capture the

16
00:01:11,149 --> 00:01:18,020
flag is a speed driven bug hunting
contest on primary and people who can

17
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:22,429
succeed at the top level of capture the
flag are the world's great bug hunters

18
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:27,170
and they can use that skill to look for
bugs in the code that runs our

19
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:28,369
civilization

20
00:01:28,369 --> 00:01:33,650
DARPA posted the call for applicants in
october twenty second 2013 to develop

21
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:37,549
autonomous cyber reasoning systems
capable of comprehending and protecting

22
00:01:37,549 --> 00:01:43,220
software over 100 teams from all over
the world responded after three

23
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:46,220
qualifying events seven finalists were
announced

24
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:55,960
those seven finalists teams are Co jitsu
from berkeley california sea SDS from

25
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:58,779
the university of idaho deep red

26
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:04,120
arlington virginia dissect from Athens
Georgia for all secure

27
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:10,600
pittsburgh PA from university of
california santa barbara shellfish and

28
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:15,850
tech x from ithaca new york and the
University of Virginia purposely

29
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:17,859
awarding money two of the top three

30
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:22,150
so first place gets two million dollars
second place gets a million dollars to

31
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:26,920
replacing 750k but for people don't walk
away with any private money and that

32
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:30,100
makes me feel a little bad because these
teams are amazing

33
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:34,359
the teams are competing for more than
the money there's a sense of urgency in

34
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,320
their work

35
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:38,500
the more we rely on computer control
things in our lives

36
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:42,250
the more we open ourselves up to
computer intrusions and attacks

37
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:45,310
I've done nothing wrong to them I
haven't done anything wrong and they

38
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:48,760
slap me in the gut and smack across the
nation they steal my money and they

39
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,679
steal my identity because they can

40
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:56,500
that bothers me no whole world is moving
towards computers we know this

41
00:02:56,500 --> 00:03:01,000
everything is becoming automated you
know pacemakers refrigerators

42
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,770
everything is connected to the internet
one way or another these days it's

43
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:10,780
called the Internet of Things trouble is
trusting these devices when they are

44
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:15,700
vulnerable and therefore hackable
finding and fixing vulnerabilities

45
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:19,660
currently lies entirely in human hands
and we are overwhelmed

46
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:26,950
the idea behind this is that in the
cyber world things smooth so fast that

47
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:31,570
it's really impossible for humans to
react and so we've got to come up with

48
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:34,120
automated defenses

49
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:36,640
right now we know that machines have the
speed in the scale that they don't have

50
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,750
the expertise

51
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:41,709
people have the expertise but they're
they're too slow and they do not scale

52
00:03:41,709 --> 00:03:45,850
cgc as a way to feed into that vision of
making sure it's fully autonomous and

53
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:48,790
beyond finding the problems actually
fixing them

54
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:51,380
the CDC's a dream can we

55
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:54,920
build a super computers that can compete
with the best humans in the world that

56
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:55,970
capture the flag

57
00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:59,750
if they can do that if that computers
can maybe not beat the best actress the

58
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:03,860
world can at least play with them can
hang with them and we've built something

59
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:08,960
amazing so history with tall whether
this was a an incremental change or a

60
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:09,830
huge leap

61
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:13,670
we're all in this together and we have
to build defensible networks we have to

62
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:21,409
give tools these institutions that that
work on and and right now as we want to

63
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:28,130
put network technologies in did more and
more things we also have to find a way

64
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:31,850
to make them safer and it's it's a
challenge for civilization
