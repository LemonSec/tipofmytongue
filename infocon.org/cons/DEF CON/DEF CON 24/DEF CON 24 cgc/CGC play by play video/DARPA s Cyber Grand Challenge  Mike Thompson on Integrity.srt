1
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:07,680
my primary responsibility is to look at
the integrity of the game

2
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:14,610
DARPA told the competitors that when
they submit software that's going to run

3
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:17,610
on our infrastructure we will get that
software

4
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:22,689
and try to determine or confirm that
that software is not going to try to

5
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:27,039
compromise the integrity of the game
since there's going to be a lot of

6
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:31,930
software submitted because what we're
talking about is both patched software

7
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:36,370
that is the fixes that their systems
find and the proofs of vulnerability

8
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:41,980
so all of that software we have to
analyze and it to scale that with human

9
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:43,599
beings is not really practical

10
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:50,409
so my primary responsibility has been
developing a forensics system that

11
00:00:50,409 --> 00:00:55,570
scales and can during the competition
that all of that software that's coming

12
00:00:55,570 --> 00:00:58,570
into the game

13
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:03,040
yeah
