1
00:00:03,190 --> 00:00:08,740
mission focus you know when to make sure
that everything's there so that we don't

2
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:14,289
have any errors that interrupts the game
and just continuously monitoring

3
00:00:14,289 --> 00:00:17,619
throughout the time period that they

4
00:00:17,619 --> 00:00:21,130
the game is running that machines are
looking healthy

5
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:25,060
the operating systems that the machines
have writing on them are looking healthy

6
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:28,630
that the different layers of the game
above that are looking healthy we all

7
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:33,850
have various things that were looking at
kind of you could think of it as an

8
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:39,789
emission control way to confirm to us
that the game is progressing as we

9
00:00:39,789 --> 00:00:45,460
expect and so will just be all focused
on that and then if there's any problems

10
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:46,600
that come along

11
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:49,989
midi mitigating those problems as
quickly as possible to the game can

12
00:00:49,989 --> 00:00:50,468
continue
