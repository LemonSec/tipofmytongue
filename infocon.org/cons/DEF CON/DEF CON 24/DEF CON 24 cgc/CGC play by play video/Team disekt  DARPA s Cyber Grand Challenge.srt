1
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:14,399
throughout designing our system for the
cyber grand challenge one of our many

2
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,869
concerns is how can we apply this to the
real world and the first thing that

3
00:00:18,869 --> 00:00:20,279
comes to mind is you know

4
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:23,849
defending our own systems in defending
the systems of those who employs is

5
00:00:23,849 --> 00:00:29,130
ultimately we have a lot of events every
year that compromise people's personal

6
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:33,809
information and it's our efforts and
CDC's and are possessed roots and all

7
00:00:33,809 --> 00:00:38,430
the teams that are competing in darkness
event that will ultimately defend people

8
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:42,000
from these attacks when he had a
revolution to really get to a safe for

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,260
cyberspace

10
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:49,559
otherwise you will still keep hearing
all of the best story dissect a computer

11
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:53,040
security team working out of a
technology incubator in Athens Georgia

12
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:56,250
is building a cyber reasoning system

13
00:00:56,250 --> 00:01:00,329
crispy to compete in the cyber Grand
Challenge capture the flag tournament

14
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:06,360
our team is involved in playing capture
the flag competitions and that computer

15
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:11,670
security face and for this challenge
we've set out to try and compete by

16
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:16,049
designing a cyber reasoning system a
cyber reasoning system

17
00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:21,389
crs creates its own knowledge
autonomously searching code for flaws

18
00:01:21,389 --> 00:01:26,579
then writing its own intrusion detection
signatures and security patches that are

19
00:01:26,579 --> 00:01:29,068
definitely two types of people that do
these kind of calendar there's the

20
00:01:29,069 --> 00:01:33,659
people do the official academic way they
do theory and there's the people that

21
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:37,829
play the CTF like us actually do it
manually we actually look at the bynars

22
00:01:37,829 --> 00:01:42,749
we play the games and for this approach
we needed both of those and i think our

23
00:01:42,749 --> 00:01:46,020
team has a component for each one of
those and we put them together in a

24
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:47,670
single system

25
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:52,229
and I think that we apply several skills
& Beyond software engineering we also

26
00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:57,960
have a lot of strength and in the
reverse engineering and other tools that

27
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:01,350
we need to to compete

28
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:05,729
whether it's rebuilding a car engine or
figuring out how a computer program

29
00:02:05,729 --> 00:02:06,479
works

30
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:10,199
people can learn about many things
simply by taking them apart and putting

31
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:11,609
them back together again

32
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:15,420
sometimes with changes that in a
nutshell is the idea behind reverse

33
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:21,119
engineering breaking something down in
order to understand it in the cyber

34
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,890
Grand Challenge automated systems will
try to find the broken parts fix or

35
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:30,869
replace them and add defenses and then
put the program back together but I

36
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:36,209
think that's probably one of our most
important assets is just our dedication

37
00:02:36,209 --> 00:02:42,090
and that there's something intangible
about the dick addictiveness of CTF and

38
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:46,560
i think that the same goes for the cyber
grand challenge for DARPA and that it's

39
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:52,200
addictive and you have to have a amount
of dedication to apply yourself to

40
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:56,790
software engineering tasks in this case
it's just computer to computer that's

41
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:58,530
more of an equal playing around

42
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:03,600
if Chris pecan crunch the numbers
dissect will take home the two

43
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,600
million-dollar prize

44
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:13,170
yeah
