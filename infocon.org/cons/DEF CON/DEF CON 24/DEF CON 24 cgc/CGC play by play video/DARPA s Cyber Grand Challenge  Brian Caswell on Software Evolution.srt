1
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:07,369
a goal that I would love to see solved
is not only are they able to patch their

2
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:08,420
vulnerabilities

3
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:13,730
but a different team able to prove that
that patch might not be good enough and

4
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:16,880
then because they're battling back and
forth

5
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:20,390
the software will get better and better
and better throughout the game

6
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,199
it's not just one and you know one guy
gets the push and the other guy gets to

7
00:00:24,199 --> 00:00:25,099
push back

8
00:00:25,099 --> 00:00:28,460
it's a constant struggle and there's
constant improvement something i'm

9
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:32,960
really looking forward to is seeing if
the computers are able to do that

10
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,170
constant evolution of software to make
it better and better

11
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:40,790
throughout the competition if they can
do that that technology moved into the

12
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:43,250
real world would be amazing

13
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:48,950
yeah
