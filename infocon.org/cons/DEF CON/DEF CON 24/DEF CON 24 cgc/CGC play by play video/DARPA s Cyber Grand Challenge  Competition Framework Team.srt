1
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:06,149
provided with you what's your name and
what do you do

2
00:00:06,149 --> 00:00:09,510
Jason right kernel developer Mike
Thompson forensics

3
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:13,500
I'm hold Sorenson I sit in between all
of the things that make sure they were

4
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:14,910
on doing ops

5
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:18,180
Bryan Caswell game orchestration in
scoring

6
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:23,970
Chris eagle chief architect 10-13 we all
right so you've been working on this for

7
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:25,409
how many years now

8
00:00:25,409 --> 00:00:30,779
333 and here's three years so is this
something you do after work for an hour

9
00:00:30,779 --> 00:00:36,240
every day there's in like a real job a
real job now we're all just for you all

10
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:41,250
is it is a lot of work yeah so what
exactly is the work what what did you

11
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:45,630
have to do you familiar with the
previous grand challenges with the urban

12
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:50,640
challenge which are / and automobile
self-driving car challenges right to big

13
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,940
aspects that there's the team that
designs of course there's the

14
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:55,769
competitors of design the car

15
00:00:55,770 --> 00:01:00,120
so our competition there are people that
create the course that's not us

16
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:05,610
there's three teams of four we've been
calling CB authors and created like more

17
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:08,540
than a hundred courses at the
competitors are gonna have to navigate

18
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:13,700
so the competitors great cyber reasoning
system as other team creates the course

19
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:19,730
we create all of the stuff that last
time that we got for free like gravity

20
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:22,340
visits like the rest of the world

21
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:29,240
the planet the business yeah so these
darpa grand challenges are made to spark

22
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:33,289
innovation and really to give birth to
the Future to change the world change

23
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:34,520
the way things are

24
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:40,759
so this cyber grand challenge is not as
obvious to say create a self-driving car

25
00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:41,630
right

26
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:48,289
so as you guys came in to this challenge
you had to be consistent with DARPA's

27
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:48,860
goals

28
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:55,250
you may have had your own personal goals
my personal goal was to build a

29
00:01:55,250 --> 00:02:00,170
framework that would allow continued
research long after the competition

30
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:01,190
ended

31
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:05,990
could we build a framework and build a
full competition that would allow you to

32
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:08,929
test technology and compare and contrast

33
00:02:08,929 --> 00:02:14,030
can we know is this antivirus better
than that one better detection and

34
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:14,989
response

35
00:02:14,989 --> 00:02:22,370
we need to start moving away from
signature based solutions while

36
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:24,680
preserving performance

37
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:31,610
well as a society were more trusting
software to do things for us

38
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:32,720
day to day

39
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:38,210
that amount of trust is growing and we
really haven't seen arise in the

40
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:41,300
trustworthiness of the software that we
rely upon

41
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:46,550
so I think cgc might be able to help
automate the identification of flaws in

42
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:50,630
the software that we all end up relying
on my goal of this project has been to

43
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:54,650
ensure that we've got good science so
that we have results the so the

44
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:58,610
environment the competitor see is
consistent every time these systems are

45
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:03,050
being passed to do some pretty
incredible things with with lots of

46
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:06,950
components without any humans of the
keyboard

47
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:11,690
we've seen indications are qualifying
event that are that there's a high

48
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:14,959
likelihood that will see some pretty
amazing things we've got several

49
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:19,700
different teams are all strong and each
may be strong in a different technical

50
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:23,989
area and the team that wins may not be
strong across the board

51
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:28,940
they happen to win but somebody else may
have been excellent in a an area that

52
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:33,020
they weren't excellent in and so the
team's whether the whether these teams

53
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:36,560
or whether it's other folks that come on
academic or commercial

54
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:43,190
it can take these technologies and move
forward in a meaningful way to provide

55
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:47,989
benefits to the the world at large
really but what are the standards are

56
00:03:47,989 --> 00:03:51,170
there people that make everything
publicly available immediately and you

57
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:52,670
know what was the red

58
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:56,359
regardless of their specific software
that they're using the salted the

59
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:59,420
competition all of the data they
generate

60
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:02,899
so all of their patches all of their
proofs of vulnerabilities

61
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:06,799
we're going to be releasing that
throughout the competition such that

62
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:10,280
everybody into attending Def Con and
more importantly the rest of the world

63
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,019
will be able to play along

64
00:04:12,019 --> 00:04:16,010
they'll be able to apply their own tools
they'll be able to analyze what these

65
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:19,789
systems did and how they did it and
where improvements they could make

66
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:25,349
this is actually impacting things they
may not have done this work

67
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:30,090
were it not for this grand challenge is
that the case you think that

68
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:32,070
sure I think they would have done the
work

69
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:35,130
a much smaller scale so it sort of its
yeah

70
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:38,490
so this is accelerated but you don't
probably would have been fully automated

71
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:40,380
right

72
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:45,120
a lot of the research that has happened
for the last 5 10 years in this area has

73
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,630
been piecemeal you know you build a
small component over here you build a

74
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:53,250
small component over here we've never
seen all of the stuff integrated

75
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:55,710
together and we've never seen it at this
scale

76
00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:59,130
what was the craziest thing that
happened during this development was the

77
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:03,480
craziest story or even one of the roads
i have a debug i can only reproduce when

78
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:08,040
we had 10,000 processes running on the
system that was one really fairly

79
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:13,500
critical problem that that after much
and much trouble shooting a lots of

80
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:16,820
intelligent people ended up to be

81
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:22,010
a cable that was a misconfigured and
every one of our servers

82
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:25,909
I was checking people's check the power

83
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:26,750
definitely

84
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:31,250
yeah this is successful or not it
probably is going to be

85
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:39,140
are you willing to do it again the band
back together to get the best for last
