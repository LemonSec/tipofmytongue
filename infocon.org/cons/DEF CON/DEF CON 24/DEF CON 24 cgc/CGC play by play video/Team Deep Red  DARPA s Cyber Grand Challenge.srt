1
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:16,760
the best efforts fall short people are
imperfect and as a result in security

2
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:18,050
remains

3
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:25,400
you can have antivirus software that's
intended to protect you that is itself

4
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,439
vulnerable

5
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:32,149
you know every time you take a step and
you think you're introducing some sort

6
00:00:32,149 --> 00:00:33,200
of a protection

7
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,410
you're you seem to always be introducing
another hole

8
00:00:37,129 --> 00:00:41,120
the raytheon engineering team deep red
working out of their florida in

9
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:45,769
arlington virginia offices is creating a
computer program that finds security

10
00:00:45,769 --> 00:00:48,800
flaws and software and fixes them almost
instantly

11
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:52,099
I think there's a lot more software
being written today than there used to

12
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:55,729
be a lot more people that haven't gone
through formal disciplines and are aware

13
00:00:55,729 --> 00:01:00,559
about security so I lack of education in
some cases is a big contributor and you

14
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:04,640
know our efforts are on one side of that
where we're trying to apply technology

15
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,250
after the software is already been
released and trying to patch it

16
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:11,119
automatically while some deep red team
members have played capture the flag

17
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:17,479
Brian and Tim have not watching their
computer run the CDC competition live on

18
00:01:17,479 --> 00:01:21,289
stage in front of an audience will be
new to them they call their cyber

19
00:01:21,289 --> 00:01:25,159
reasoning system rubios a cyber
reasoning system

20
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:30,259
crs creates its own knowledge
autonomously searching code for flaws

21
00:01:30,259 --> 00:01:35,000
and writing its own intrusion detection
signatures and security patches also

22
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,609
sort of the fun part as well because
that's when you start interfacing with

23
00:01:40,609 --> 00:01:44,270
the other players and their systems

24
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:50,090
just like they can wreak havoc on your
system potentially you have the the

25
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:54,380
delight and joy of doing the same thing
to them that really is the fun part

26
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:58,100
but now because you're having to compete
in a live dynamic environment with other

27
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:01,009
competitors where they have control of
the binder that you're seeing

28
00:02:01,009 --> 00:02:04,729
I think that aspect of it that
unpredictability is going to make the

29
00:02:04,729 --> 00:02:10,429
problem much more difficult working on a
portion of it but we're not necessarily

30
00:02:10,429 --> 00:02:14,720
bringing an end to the problem

31
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:18,560
each time you take a step you know you
can make things better and better

32
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:23,930
it's hard to see that you would ever get
to a climbers where you can say the

33
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:29,209
cyber world is safe if rubios exceeds
the deep red team will claim the two

34
00:02:29,209 --> 00:02:32,500
million-dollar prize

35
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:36,040
yeah
