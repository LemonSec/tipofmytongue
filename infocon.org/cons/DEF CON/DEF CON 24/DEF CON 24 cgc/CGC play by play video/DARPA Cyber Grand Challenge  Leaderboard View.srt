1
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:13,289
we call this a scoreboard view this is
sort of your classic leaderboard

2
00:00:13,289 --> 00:00:17,310
what we're seeing here is actually an
ordered list of the individual bots and

3
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:20,430
how well they're performing so down the
left hand side you can see basically

4
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:24,180
that each of the each of the box has a
color and in the real game those colors

5
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:27,900
will be assigned to bots and throughout
all the visualizations that same color

6
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:30,990
will apply their scorecards in the arena
of you and everything will all be

7
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:32,039
colored correctly

8
00:00:32,039 --> 00:00:35,190
they'll have some iconography in the
little square sections that you can see

9
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:36,239
here that are blank

10
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:40,890
each team having its own icon and
additionally we see the aggregate scores

11
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:44,399
over here of each of those elements of
the overall scoring that we were talking

12
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:48,120
about where we have availability
security and evaluation

13
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:52,199
each being tallied in the in aggregate
across all of the services as well as

14
00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:56,370
the overall team score being represented
by this bar graph by this gray section

15
00:00:56,370 --> 00:01:01,199
of the bar graph and the numerical score
that's been calculated here so just as

16
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:04,589
each of these elements are the aggregate
score across many of the challenges all

17
00:01:04,589 --> 00:01:09,658
at once this line graph represents the
last several rounds of that aggregate

18
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:10,260
score

19
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:13,710
so we can see changes we're a team is
starting to pick up or where they're

20
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:16,890
starting to have trouble or where
they're not making too much progress at

21
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:17,430
all

22
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:21,660
in this instance this actually fairly
clearly demonstrates another another

23
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:25,200
thing we've touched on a couple of times
but the the importance of availability

24
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,670
scores becomes very apparent because
they're almost ordered according to

25
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:32,550
their availability there's a little bit
of a delta here and that's actually

26
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:36,570
because all of these points that are
being scored here in security and

27
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:40,350
evaluation for one of these teams with a
low availability score actually not

28
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:44,520
being able to be recognized in the
computation of the final aggregate score

29
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:48,539
so we'll come back to this view very
very regularly to show leader changes

30
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:52,140
you can see as as this ran you can
actually see that once the scores are

31
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:55,440
tallied leader changes will be present
on this board and it'll basically be

32
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:58,560
your constant heads up display for which
teams are in what position

33
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:05,789
yeah
