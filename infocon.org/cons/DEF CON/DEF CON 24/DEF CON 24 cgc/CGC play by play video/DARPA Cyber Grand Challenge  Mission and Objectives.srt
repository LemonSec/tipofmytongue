1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:15,280
the defense advanced research projects
agency darpa formerly arpa was

2
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:20,650
established in 1958 in response to the
launch of the first satellite Sputnik by

3
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:21,939
the Soviet Union

4
00:00:21,939 --> 00:00:26,710
DARPA's mission then and now create or
prevent strategic surprise

5
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,980
so DARPA's mission is certainly a
strategic surprise technological

6
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:36,989
surprise but it's surprise can be very
hard to predict hard to predict because

7
00:00:36,989 --> 00:00:40,470
computers are being used in more and
more things we own

8
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:45,300
so more and more programming code is
being written refrigerators washing

9
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:46,110
machines

10
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:50,489
baby monitors smart homes all app
controlled from our computer phones

11
00:00:50,489 --> 00:00:52,470
populate our lives

12
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:55,500
it's called the Internet of Things

13
00:00:55,500 --> 00:01:00,300
now the thing that we've got to do is
figure out how to make these systems

14
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:04,649
more secure because we are relying on
them for more and more the big takeaway

15
00:01:04,649 --> 00:01:08,940
is that there is a vulnerability for a
very bendable number of lines of code

16
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:10,800
and there's so much code

17
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:14,789
it's actually written every day that is
very easy to see this as a is an

18
00:01:14,789 --> 00:01:15,810
infinite problem

19
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:19,649
IBM rational need an estimate of the
number of lines of code that our

20
00:01:19,649 --> 00:01:23,399
civilization is running that it cross
the trillion lines of code in mid-2000

21
00:01:23,399 --> 00:01:27,479
that does not count the number of times
that those lines have been replicated

22
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:30,840
turned into binary code and stamped into
chips

23
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:34,500
the Kannada longer be updated and those
chips have been put into things and

24
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,600
those things have been distributed
around the world

25
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:39,270
I mean we've got a billion
vulnerabilities like I can't wrap my

26
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:40,920
head around the tree lines of code

27
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:43,920
can I wrap my head around a billion
vulnerabilities

28
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:50,440
that's a gargantuan problem gargantuan
and increasingly concerning and think of

29
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:53,800
the internet of things in in two
distinct groups there are conveniences

30
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:58,929
there are the things that are critical
smart power grids water supplies traffic

31
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:03,640
lights air travel are all
computer-controlled which intruders

32
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:09,160
could shut down and and DARPA because
our job is to prevent strategic surprise

33
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:14,500
because that hasn't happened kind of
physical breach of trust on the on a

34
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:18,850
very large scale we need to start
building solutions now before something

35
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:22,570
terrible violent as we cross that line
receive if you could we are having a

36
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:23,620
competition

37
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:27,520
we're trying to spark automation of
tasks that are exclusively the domain of

38
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:31,209
people but what will come of that is
largely unknown to us

39
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:38,560
the cyber grand challenge the CDC will
be a fully automated capture the flag

40
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:44,170
contest with computers pitted against
computers humans will program their

41
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:48,220
machines and then step aside to watch
them play the game before a live

42
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:49,690
audience

43
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:53,590
we can decide the good ideas based on
competition we can determine the bad

44
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:55,510
ideas based on competition

45
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:59,260
it's a challenge it's great and at the
end of a challenge

46
00:02:59,769 --> 00:03:03,010
we know it works and we know it doesn't
work everybody will get us a little

47
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:08,739
piece of it right and learn from each
other and prototyping on a very quick

48
00:03:08,739 --> 00:03:09,400
deadline

49
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,040
the morris results

50
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,879
that's what the cyber grand challenge is
trying to tell us to understand to what

51
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:19,409
degree can we build these systems that
stand on their own and has with the CDC

52
00:03:19,409 --> 00:03:23,969
also and also with our research in
general and with our properties

53
00:03:23,969 --> 00:03:29,129
it's about developing techniques to help
us to improve security even when we have

54
00:03:29,129 --> 00:03:30,870
complex halfway

55
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:34,409
we don't know that the Grand Challenge
will be successful we don't know that

56
00:03:34,409 --> 00:03:40,888
we'll see a viable proof autonomy that
there is even proof that automated bug

57
00:03:40,889 --> 00:03:46,319
checking and proofing and patching has a
future with current technology we've

58
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:50,189
done everything possible to set the
stage for that to have an open call for

59
00:03:50,189 --> 00:03:53,430
innovators to make sure that the top
talent from around the world is working

60
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:56,280
on the problem and certainly we can hope
for them

61
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:59,700
the end result is not the answer

62
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:02,700
it's just the beginning

63
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:10,730
yeah
