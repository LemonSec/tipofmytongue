1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:14,580
capture the flag is a head-to-head
networked competition played by the

2
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:16,320
world's top hackers

3
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,909
it's a race to find diagnose and fix
software flaws in real time in an

4
00:00:20,909 --> 00:00:22,918
adversarial environment

5
00:00:22,919 --> 00:00:27,539
it's named after the children's game
with flags hidden in forts in distant

6
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:31,619
fields but here the environment is made
of unexplored code

7
00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:35,100
the flags are secret data and the
players move through security weaknesses

8
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:38,250
to capture flags at network speeds

9
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:42,660
the game begins when the network is
activated and the unexplored code is

10
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:47,190
revealed to the players each player
controls a defended host a server

11
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:52,050
running an identical copy of the
unexplored code at the center is the

12
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:59,370
referee the referee serves up unexplored
code in bundles new challenge binaries

13
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:04,259
are released to the players throughout
the game challenge binaries are small

14
00:01:04,259 --> 00:01:08,759
original programs written with one or
more vulnerabilities and flags to

15
00:01:08,759 --> 00:01:14,189
protect or be captured three tasks must
be performed by the players to win

16
00:01:14,789 --> 00:01:18,600
players must protect all their digital
flags from opponents by patching the

17
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:22,408
software on their server keep the
software on their server healthy and

18
00:01:22,409 --> 00:01:26,399
functional and scan for opponent
vulnerabilities to capture flags

19
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:31,910
the referee constantly emits tests to
measure whether defendants software has

20
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:37,009
been damaged off like capture attempts
are routed through the referee and mixed

21
00:01:37,010 --> 00:01:43,550
with the referees tests many capture the
flag contests are played in rounds at

22
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:44,750
the end of each round

23
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:47,960
the referee tallied the scores for all
of the systems

24
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:51,110
the game is scored in three distinct
areas

25
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:57,320
security each competitor can defend the
code on its server keeping flag safe

26
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:02,059
it can patch each challenge binary using
generic defenses or a custom patch for

27
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:06,410
each vulnerability it finds availability

28
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:11,180
every program on a server should
function normally after being patched it

29
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:15,260
would be easy to defend software if you
can just disable all its functionality

30
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:19,190
the referee checks that defendant
software is responding correctly and

31
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:23,870
hasn't been disabled or slowed
evaluation

32
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:28,670
every player can program a vulnerability
scanner searching for vulnerabilities

33
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:33,829
and opponents improving these weaknesses
to the referee a successful proof yields

34
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:35,570
a captured flag

35
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:42,230
the game is captured the flag points are
awarded for captured flags and points

36
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:47,149
are forfeited for damaging the defendant
software or losing flags at the end of

37
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:47,750
the game

38
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:53,570
the competitor with the most points wins
like most games

39
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:58,519
capture the flag is a game of strategy
what should a player do when she finds a

40
00:02:58,519 --> 00:03:01,580
vulnerability patch it right away

41
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:07,400
don't patch and watch the network scan
opponents first tell no one

42
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:13,100
build an office cated defense to the
issue these questions of strategy and

43
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:16,130
tactics have been wrestled with by the
teams of experts who have played this

44
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:17,600
game for decades

45
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:21,769
it's a game of analysis speed skill and
endurance

46
00:03:21,769 --> 00:03:24,769
it's a game played by the best in the
world

47
00:03:24,769 --> 00:03:30,170
it's a game no computer has ever played
requiring skills that have never been

48
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:35,720
effectively automated on August fourth
2016 autonomous computers will play

49
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:38,950
capture the flag for the first time in
history

50
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:44,349
who knows what's possible when this game
is played at machine speed
