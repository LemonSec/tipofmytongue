1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:09,979
yeah

2
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:17,349
Sean O'Brien I am in charge of logistics
for the cyber grand challenge here so I

3
00:00:17,349 --> 00:00:20,829
manage all of the logistics of putting
on and producing this event

4
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:32,400
so these racks are heavy about a ton

5
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:38,070
each in terms of weight they are the
size of like a large refrigerator box or

6
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:40,320
a vending machine

7
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:46,110
each hpc rack that the team gets has 64
individual nodes inside of it

8
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:52,530
each one of those nodes is powered by 2
2.5 gigahertz intel xeon processors each

9
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:58,140
one of those notes also has 256
gigabytes of ram and 2 1 terabyte hard

10
00:00:58,140 --> 00:00:59,220
disk storage

11
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:02,250
each one of those requires its own power
and cooling

12
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:05,339
we are putting in liquid cold racks

13
00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:10,229
because these things run so hot that we
can't do a typical air-cooled scenario

14
00:01:10,229 --> 00:01:16,410
inside this bottom so each one at their
maximum theoretical uses about twenty

15
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:21,539
two kilowatts of power our entire suite
of equipment out there is going to run

16
00:01:21,539 --> 00:01:27,600
about 250 kilowatts of total power used
we've exceeded the the capacity of the

17
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:28,199
hotel

18
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:32,300
so now we've got to bring in industrial
chillers and actually pipe water in

19
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:36,259
from these killers operating on the curb
outside the casino up through the

20
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:37,400
loading ramp

21
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:41,090
we're running thousands of gallons of
chilled water into the ballroom to cool

22
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:42,200
these racks

23
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:46,130
we have thousands of feet of piping and
hosing that were putting in so we have

24
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:50,390
plumbing is it is a bit of a challenge
and now have it converted and

25
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:53,690
transformed into a liquid cooled data
center chillers are up and running

26
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:56,929
everything's watertight and we are
circulating water today

27
00:01:56,930 --> 00:02:01,820
so another big challenge here is you
know we've taken great pains to create

28
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:06,320
this air gap and that everything that
happens inside the air gap is happening

29
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:10,549
autonomous and so the only way data
flows out of that air gap is through our

30
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:16,250
air gap robot which is literally reading
cds worth of burn data from inside the

31
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:20,810
air gap and then physically moving that
CD across an outside the air gap and

32
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:25,520
dropping it to a CD reader where it goes
off to our our scores and visualization

33
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,690
it's certainly some sleepless nights and
a lot of hard work putting one of these

34
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:31,109
events on and

35
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:35,010
only doing all the risk mitigation to
make sure that it goes off without a

36
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:35,609
hitch

37
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:38,430
but there's a huge reward at the end of
the day because you can look at your

38
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:42,930
kids and for your friends your family
and say you know that thing that you

39
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:45,930
you heard about I was there when it
started

40
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:50,360
yeah

41
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,550
yeah
