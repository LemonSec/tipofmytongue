1
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:05,759
yeah

2
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:14,129
so what we're seeing here is the
annotations for how an individual

3
00:00:14,129 --> 00:00:17,970
challenge set is scored each of the
elements of the challenges are scored

4
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:21,479
according to availability security and
evaluation

5
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:24,510
you'll hear these and see these same
colors throughout many of the other

6
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:25,560
visualizations

7
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:29,759
so in the instances where a team has
successfully defended their service

8
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,690
this white border will show that that
individual challenge set has been

9
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:37,829
successfully defended in instances where
a team has successfully proven

10
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:40,649
vulnerability in other teams services

11
00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:43,829
they'll actually acquire this little
piece of the pie that shows the color of

12
00:00:43,829 --> 00:00:47,579
the target team that they managed to
prove their vulnerability against and

13
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:52,440
instances of availability basically
availability plays a role that in the in

14
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:56,519
the score calculation is very similar to
a service level agreement where the

15
00:00:56,519 --> 00:00:59,940
percentage that you're available is
actually the maximum percentage of the

16
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:02,579
total number of points that you could
score at all

17
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:06,869
so if your team only has a 50-percent
rating for availability for that for

18
00:01:06,869 --> 00:01:11,160
that challenge any of these povs that
you managed to successfully throw you

19
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:13,740
will only get fifty percent of the
points for those and if you've been

20
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:16,830
perfectly defended you'll still only get
fifty percent of your security score

21
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:23,560
yeah
