1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:13,969
in the cyber Grand Challenge autonomous
computers will play capture the flag for

2
00:00:13,969 --> 00:00:15,889
the first time in history

3
00:00:15,889 --> 00:00:20,689
what's there to watch once the machines
are turned on lots it turns out how do

4
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:24,650
we look at millions of packets flowing
around what that means that we show that

5
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:25,639
in a kind of meaningful way

6
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:29,450
everything you see on the screen is
automatically generated and reflect

7
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:33,410
something that's actually happening
inside of a system that has seven

8
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:35,449
supercomputers interacting with each
other

9
00:00:35,449 --> 00:00:39,230
we've got one that we call the filament
viewer the trace viewer and that shows a

10
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:43,730
program as it runs this is actually a
representation of two different binaries

11
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:48,108
where one is a patched version of the
other so the cool thing is this allows

12
00:00:48,109 --> 00:00:53,120
us to actually show divergence between
two executions based on either input or

13
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,839
modified binaries we can see some of
these sort of loop like structures that

14
00:00:56,839 --> 00:01:01,760
show the individual code blocks
executing but across time

15
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:05,570
so what this view allows us to do is
have many of those types of of

16
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:09,139
constructs that were used to seeing in
machine code that represent cold logic

17
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:13,250
and code and data structures actually
present themselves with very unique

18
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:14,120
shapes

19
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:16,310
this is literally running through code
and I can actually see like the

20
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:20,060
disassembly like the raw instructions
the cpu here in the disassembly windows

21
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:20,450
yeah

22
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:24,170
opinions are think it really can become
incomprehensible to anybody to see these

23
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:28,370
small visual differences we get data for
all of these interactions that are

24
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:31,940
happening and we turned it into a big
picture view that I like to think of as

25
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:35,060
a three-ring or more accurately a7 ring
circus

26
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:38,120
we actually have a system that can
automatically play the game and analyze

27
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:41,540
it and tell us interesting things that
are happening outside the games network

28
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:45,110
so the visualizations are actually
incredibly dense hopefully they're

29
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:49,850
elegant enough that they're interesting
to watch on their own but what's neat is

30
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:53,899
that every single thing that you see on
screen is there for a reason and reflect

31
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:55,450
something that's actually happening

32
00:01:55,450 --> 00:02:01,930
inside of a game system that is showing
7 supercomputers interacting with each

33
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:03,549
other at lightning fast speed
