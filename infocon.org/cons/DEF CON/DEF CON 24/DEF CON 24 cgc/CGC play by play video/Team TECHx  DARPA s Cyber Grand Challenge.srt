1
00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:15,370
a lot of critical infrastructure started
being controlled by computers

2
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:18,550
the power grid became more dependent on
computers

3
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:23,110
water you know delivery systems
communication systems

4
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:29,680
I mean again back then a few people had
cell phones for tech x is a

5
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:34,809
collaboration between a university and
Industry the program analysis power of

6
00:00:34,809 --> 00:00:38,620
Ithaca New York's grandma tech
corporation a team of hacking demux from

7
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:42,608
the University of Virginia the joint
force is a few years ago to develop an

8
00:00:42,609 --> 00:00:47,620
automatic software hardening technology
preventing exploits of software of

9
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:50,050
uncertain provenance they call it

10
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:54,730
pea soup pea soup technology is already
competition ready

11
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:59,019
having demonstrated its robustness and
effectiveness under independent test and

12
00:00:59,019 --> 00:01:04,809
evaluation now they're developing a
cyber reasoning system they call Sandra

13
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:11,770
so it was kind of this natural melding
of talent we have strengths in the area

14
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:16,929
of taking programs and modifying them
you have to prevent you know

15
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:21,909
vulnerabilities from being exploited so
it was kind of this natural melding of

16
00:01:21,909 --> 00:01:22,990
talent

17
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:28,509
it was interesting because they had
strengths in the area of doing symbolic

18
00:01:28,509 --> 00:01:33,820
execution symbolic execution is a
different way to study software rather

19
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:37,990
than laying out a map of tests and
decisions symbolic execution build a

20
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:42,310
giant mathematical equation that
processes input in the same way as the

21
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:47,560
software being studied these equations
get very big very fast and can be

22
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,220
difficult to solve

23
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:53,030
I consider myself a hacker on think I'm
a pretty good one

24
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:58,400
there's both white hat hacking and black
hat hacking and you know we're really

25
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,710
focused on the white hat hacking

26
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:04,610
it's important to understand how these
attacks work because how can you defend

27
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:07,490
against them if you don't understand how
that works

28
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:10,490
cyber Grand Challenges a security
competition

29
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:17,780
it is trying to develop automated
systems to play this game of breaking

30
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:22,580
into other systems and defending from
other systems breaking into you

31
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:26,990
DARPA was very clever and how they
structure this

32
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:31,820
so they don't have to come up with test
to see how strong our defenses are the

33
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:33,829
other competitors are doing that

34
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:38,570
so that's kind of cool right now we're
testing each other's defenses by

35
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:39,890
attacking each other

36
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:42,950
the both sides the white hat and the
blackheads

37
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:46,160
our goal is to create a tool that can
automatically protect software systems

38
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:51,620
gives Andres exceeds the tech ex white
hat hackers can ride off with a

39
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:54,620
two-million-dollar prize

40
00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:00,329
yeah
