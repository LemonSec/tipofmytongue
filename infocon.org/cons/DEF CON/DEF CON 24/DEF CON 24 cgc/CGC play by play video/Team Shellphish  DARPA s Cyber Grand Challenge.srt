1
00:00:01,610 --> 00:00:06,509
yeah

2
00:00:06,509 --> 00:00:11,580
so basically what ass that was

3
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:20,099
hey mom let's say that I was taking exam
and this exam was are initiated by . by

4
00:00:20,099 --> 00:00:25,500
about my group cuts cuts easy and I said
wow that that that's cool

5
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:28,619
although she doesn't really know what
did you see this that's a yes

6
00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:32,790
meet shellfish a student-led team from
the University of California Santa

7
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:37,079
Barbara of all the reasoning systems
competing in the final event the

8
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:41,309
shellfish system has some of the
youngest architects the computer

9
00:00:41,309 --> 00:00:45,059
security version of capture the flag is
just like the game you played as a kid

10
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:49,740
but the flags are made of data in the
field is made of brand new code

11
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:54,960
it's the job of CTF competitors to
reverse engineer that code to explore

12
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,670
and heal its weaknesses

13
00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:02,400
- general courses quite old I think
they're the oldest CTF team now that

14
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,500
that kind of still exists

15
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:11,310
I we we always played a lot of cts and
when this you see was announced the

16
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:15,899
thinking was like holy cow this is the
future of hacking right

17
00:01:16,499 --> 00:01:22,020
shellfish is the hacking team for UCSB
sec lab the school's computer security

18
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:25,289
research group their cyber reasoning
system

19
00:01:25,289 --> 00:01:29,609
mechanical fish is their cyber combatant
in the CGC final event

20
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:34,979
it's powered by anger a software tool
box used to build systems that analyzed

21
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:38,039
computer code at the deepest binary
level

22
00:01:38,039 --> 00:01:42,630
what is anger anger is a framework for
analyzing binary software

23
00:01:43,319 --> 00:01:46,319
it focuses on both static and dynamic
symbolic execution

24
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:50,270
making it applicable to a variety of
analytic tasks

25
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:57,320
what you're doing when you're hacking is
you take a binary that just knows how to

26
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:03,289
walk and you make it dance right and so
we are building a robot that

27
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:06,890
automatically finds these binaries and
make some fans

28
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:11,959
the group's research focus is on
programming intrusion detection and as

29
00:02:11,959 --> 00:02:17,690
our Internet of Things grows the chances
of program vulnerabilities increases the

30
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:21,920
team wants to stop smart home invasions
think one of the big things have this

31
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:28,070
competition is humans make mistakes
humans can't accurately find all falls

32
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:32,180
and programs or verify that their secure
and so we need machines that can do this

33
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:36,680
and machines that can help take a load
off humans and I think this will be one

34
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:41,300
of the big important improvements in
making appears more secure for users

35
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:47,300
if mechanical fish can control anger
team shellfish will take home the two

36
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:48,860
million-dollar prize
