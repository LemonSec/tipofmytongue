1
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:15,100
the fact that we are becoming ever more
dependent on technology

2
00:00:16,209 --> 00:00:19,480
you know and I saw that in the eighties
coming

3
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:25,869
the fact that than somebody anywhere in
the world could impact and hurt us could

4
00:00:25,869 --> 00:00:28,869
damage our systems just because they
want to just because it's fun for them

5
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:32,379
I've done nothing wrong to them I
haven't done anything wrong and they

6
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:33,910
slap me in the gut

7
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:36,398
the smack across the face and they steal
my money and they steal my identity

8
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:41,170
because they camp that bothers me it was

for secure and dependable systems see
SDS a cyber Grand Challenge finalists

11
00:00:52,089 --> 00:00:56,230
preparing its computer to do battle in
the world's first all computer capture

12
00:00:56,230 --> 00:00:57,578
the flag tournament

13
00:00:57,579 --> 00:01:01,570
the computer security version of capture
the flag is just like the game you

14
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:05,950
played as a kid but the flags are made
of data and the field is made of brand

15
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:06,850
new code

16
00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:11,979
it's the job of cft competitors to
reverse engineer that code to explore

17
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:17,800
and heal its weaknesses see SDS
qualified as a two-person team doctor

18
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:21,310
alves Foss and dr. GS on an assistant
research professor

19
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:28,000
they're building their cyber reasoning
system Jima completely from scratch the

20
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,530
computer security products were used to
like antivirus software are filled with

21
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:35,950
knowledge written by experts signatures
and patches

22
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:41,620
what cgc is building is something new a
cyber reasoning system that does its own

23
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:46,210
investigations and creates its own
knowledge autonomously searching code

24
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:50,199
for flaws than writing its own intrusion
detection signatures and security

25
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:50,980
patches

26
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:55,750
well when I was talking to some people
said oh no do you binary disassembly is

27
00:01:55,750 --> 00:02:00,700
impossible you cant in general
disassembled code and get the right

28
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:02,090
source

29
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:05,869
and in general that's case but this was
a lot more special case environment so

30
00:02:05,869 --> 00:02:09,410
we could do it here but I thought we
could look at this and try and figure

31
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:16,910
out what to do so I wrote some tools to
just quickly start analyzing sample

32
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:21,170
binaries analyzing what would be
generated by the degree tool to see what

33
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:25,730
we can find out a decree is a miniature
operating system just for capture the

34
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:29,629
flat sporting a unique format and a very
simple interface

35
00:02:29,629 --> 00:02:34,429
it's incompatible by design with every
other system in the world with no shared

36
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:36,500
code roots or legacy to deal with

37
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:40,069
it's a safe haven for researchers it was

38
00:02:40,069 --> 00:02:45,980
wait we have a way of without knowing
with doing pure static analysis of the

39
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:51,230
binary of being able to detect locations
where vulnerabilities could occur and

40
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:55,160
Patrick and do it in a way that was
efficient enough we could get points on

41
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,120
the scoring

42
00:02:56,120 --> 00:03:01,400
dr. Cindy song was alves fauces student
at idaho working on a dissertation

43
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:06,708
she got interested in the challenge and
joined him in the fall of 2014

44
00:03:06,709 --> 00:03:11,359
neither of them had ever played in a
capture the flag style competition in

45
00:03:11,359 --> 00:03:13,100
jun 2015

46
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:16,760
Cindy and Jim system qualified for the
CGC finals

47
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:20,660
I'm very proud of the fact that we were
in the top five and both scored events

48
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:25,638
you know the practice events as a
two-person team going up against the

49
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:29,150
caliber of the competition we're going
against i mean i've been reading some of

50
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:33,290
these people's research papers on me a
legit looking at what they're working on

51
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:37,760
and just feel it's it's great stuff and
so the fact that our has happened to

52
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:41,179
compete well with them because we did a
slightly different approach or a very

53
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:42,500
different approach depending

54
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:45,590
it was just amazing and exciting

55
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:51,440
dr. songs primary focus is finding the
bugs Jim's dispatching them if they're

56
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:56,810
