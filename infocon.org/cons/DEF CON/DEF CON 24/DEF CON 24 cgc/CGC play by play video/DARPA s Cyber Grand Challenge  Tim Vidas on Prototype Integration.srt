1
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:06,840
to be able to take binary software do
all of the analysis to find the

2
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:09,990
vulnerability to to generate the proof
to generate the patch on the

3
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:13,350
vulnerability stitching that stuff
together is not a trivial task

4
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:16,529
so in addition to developing new types
of technology for each one of those

5
00:00:16,529 --> 00:00:20,490
components this will be the first time
with completely hands-off completely

6
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:22,709
autonomous that we're seeing all of
these pieces work together
