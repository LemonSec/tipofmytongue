1
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:05,780
yeah

2
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:13,280
so this is what happens when we actually
put the whole thing back together and we

3
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:16,910
take every event that we've talked about
and every little detail that can that

4
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:19,700
can be present in any element of the
scoring system and come back to the

5
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:22,700
arena of you and show you everything
that's happening all at once

6
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:26,450
thousands of service polls running POV
is being thrown against everyone

7
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:29,450
some of them landing we can see the
colored rings occurring we can see

8
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:33,320
individual teams receiving benefits
receiving scores from those povs that

9
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:37,070
they're throwing against each other and
we can even see every one of the patch

10
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:39,679
is being rolled out and some of them are
starting to suffer availability

11
00:00:39,679 --> 00:00:43,399
constraint or availability issues so
instances like this where this is shrunk

12
00:00:43,399 --> 00:00:47,390
to nearly nothing and yet povs have been
thrown their that team is getting very

13
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:50,449
very little benefit from that we can see
that some of the services themselves

14
00:00:50,449 --> 00:00:53,748
still have their white borders they have
still not had a proof of vulnerability

15
00:00:53,749 --> 00:00:54,739
thrown against them

16
00:00:54,739 --> 00:00:57,858
those teams that have that in place and
that the tile is full size are getting

17
00:00:57,859 --> 00:01:02,149
full points for security and full points
for availability but in most instances

18
00:01:02,149 --> 00:01:06,680
have no POV is thrown successfully
except for example crs three here which

19
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:10,189
has basically scored a perfect score for
this service on this round

20
00:01:10,189 --> 00:01:13,639
and all of this is immediately
discernible from these events that are

21
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,580
occurring every round

22
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:22,179
yeah
