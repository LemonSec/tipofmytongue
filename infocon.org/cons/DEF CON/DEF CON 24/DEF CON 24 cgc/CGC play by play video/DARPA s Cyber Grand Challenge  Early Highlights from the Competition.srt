1
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:09,150
ready

2
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:10,720
ready

3
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:15,190
game started at nine hundred and
forty-five seconds specific

4
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:20,590
welcome everyone to the first ever fully
automated cybersecurity automated

5
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:21,910
competition

6
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:25,480
sandra managed to discover and prove a
vulnerability in one of the services

7
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:28,630
that we call ops him but this is a
unique situation and it's something we

8
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:32,710
were kind of hoping to see they actually
managed to discover an unintended

9
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:33,940
vulnerability

10
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:37,210
so each of these each of these services
that's written just like real world

11
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:40,780
software it's impossible for us to have
made absolutely certain that the one

12
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:44,050
vulnerability that we intended is the
only one that's present

13
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:48,580
so the interesting part here is at
Sandra discovered this new POV exercised

14
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:52,150
it against something that we hadn't
actually even intended and then Jima

15
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:56,470
observed this occurring and successfully
defended against it

16
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:59,680
so these are all results that like we
hadn't possibly had any ability to

17
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:04,330
predict what so ever so Sandra POV
succeeded against the reference binary

18
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:07,240
but not against GMOs patched binary

19
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:10,600
so ji was actually successful able to
patch a bug that we didn't even know

20
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,130
existed in the software

21
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:15,970
what kind of general purpose or even
specific patches does Jim implement that

22
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:19,360
could do this so that was probably one
of our general purpose patches

23
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:23,350
we looked at areas of code where we know
there are common vulnerabilities and we

24
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:26,649
just deliberately inserted
conservatively the patches for those

25
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:27,400
areas

26
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:30,159
the address resolution service was
basically the vulnerability that was

27
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:33,550
modeled after the sequel slammer like we
were talking about and we definitely saw

28
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:37,119
some of the bots discovered this
vulnerability and actually begin trying

29
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:40,750
to prove that vulnerability against
other teams or other BOTS very very

30
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:41,620
early on

31
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:45,250
so this represents a true success to
have to what we have going on here

32
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:49,570
because in that five-minute window that
Deb mention that she was hoping for that

33
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:53,020
actually managed to be proven and
patched by several of the teams in the

34
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:57,460
very next round so that means that in a
five-minute window a totally previously

35
00:01:57,460 --> 00:02:01,509
never seen before challenge binary was
researched and evaluated and found

36
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:04,600
vulnerable and patched by a completely
autonomous system

37
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:08,500
our implementation of the mail server
challenge basically wanted to strike a

38
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:12,370
balance between the difficulty in the
complexity of the original buggin send

39
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:16,510
mail and how FAR's example that was sort
of a carve down subset of the problem

40
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:21,670
either way they are all sort of the
classic state machine problems that are

41
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:26,049
very very difficult for program analysis
those nearly infinite possibilities and

42
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:28,330
that halting problem that we talked
about before

43
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:33,580
clearly come into play here so Mecca
fish was the only team to actually

44
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:38,680
successfully POV against our version of
crack at her

45
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:44,350
so this basically represents but elite
forward in program analysis for them to

46
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:47,230
be capable of doing this means that
we're one step closer to that thing

47
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:51,160
that's basically been sort of the
Everest of program analysis because of

48
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,450
that state machine problem

49
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:55,929
congratulations what you think about
this yeah it's pretty overwhelming

50
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:59,740
wow I mean all the talk about state
machines and all the possibilities state

51
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:02,440
machines really reminds me of one of the
papers were published recently we

52
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:06,130
published paper driller which is
supposed to augment fuzzing with

53
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:11,049
symbolic execution and 11 of our really
in-depth case studies talks about how

54
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:15,760
exactly it traverses the state machines
and is able to really explore deeply

55
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:19,239
parts of the program that would normally
be inaccessible to a more naive approach

56
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,440
thank you

57
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:28,510
today we saw machines patch many of the
vulnerabilities that were activated

58
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:33,880
their software within minutes without
damaging software or availability

59
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:38,950
challenges work not because of the many
who cannot imagine but because of the

60
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:41,799
few willing to make the attempt

61
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:49,390
thank you all for your courage I'd like
to close but this room allow this round

62
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:51,970
of applause we can summon for those who
dare
