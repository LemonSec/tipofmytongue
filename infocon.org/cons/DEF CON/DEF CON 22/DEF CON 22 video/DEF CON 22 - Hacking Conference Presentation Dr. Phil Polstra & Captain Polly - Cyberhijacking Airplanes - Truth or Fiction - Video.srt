1
00:00:00,042 --> 00:00:07,000
I would like to introduce Dr.
Phil and Captain Polly and
they're going to talk to you

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
about cyberhijacking airplanes,
tell us, is it truth or fiction.
>> I guess you'll find out. >>

3
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:27,417
Alright, guys, well, thanks for
coming. Hopefully if our talk
sucks, the next one doesn't and

4
00:00:27,417 --> 00:00:33,292
you can just stay here and have
a good seat. That was my plan
for my talk yesterday. That

5
00:00:33,292 --> 00:00:40,042
said, I'm Dr. Phil and this is
Captain Polly. Just a little bit
why this talk. Well, you know, a

6
00:00:40,042 --> 00:00:43,792
lot of people have been talking
about being able to take over
planes remotely and such, and of

7
00:00:43,792 --> 00:00:49,792
course when you say things like
that, you get a lot of press.
And so we just thought maybe it

8
00:00:54,208 --> 00:01:00,208
was time to investigate some of
these things and look into them
a little further and it's okay

9
00:01:03,042 --> 00:01:09,458
to be scared but if you're going
to be scared be scared because
of reality, not because of some

10
00:01:09,458 --> 00:01:16,708
fiction, maybe some stuff that
the media has made you think.
So, just a little bit about me.

11
00:01:16,708 --> 00:01:24,542
Some of you may know me as a
hardware hacker. I wrote a book.
Which I'm shamelessly plugging

12
00:01:24,542 --> 00:01:30,542
by putting my cover as a
background for this slide.
Anyway, in addition to that, I

13
00:01:33,167 --> 00:01:39,625
also am an aviator. I have 12
aviation ratings, they're all
current including commercial

14
00:01:39,625 --> 00:01:46,750
pilot flight instructor,
airplane mechanic inspection
authorization holder, avionics

15
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:53,500
technician, a couple others.
Thousands of hours of flight
time. Also aircraft builder and

16
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:58,667
importantly for our talk today,
I've actually done some
development and trussing work on

17
00:01:58,667 --> 00:02:04,292
some of the avionics that you
would find in some of these
modern airliners. I also have

18
00:02:04,292 --> 00:02:12,042
access to manuals, current and
former airline pilots, i.e.,
Captain Polly and others, and

19
00:02:12,042 --> 00:02:19,042
that's about me. >> So, I'm
Captain Polly. I'm currently an
associate professor at a

20
00:02:19,042 --> 00:02:23,417
college, University of Dubuque
that has a flight program that
trains pilots. >> University

21
00:02:23,417 --> 00:02:29,333
redacted. >> Redacted, yes okay.
>> My background one here is to
just give you the perspective is

22
00:02:29,333 --> 00:02:35,333
commercial airline pilot
training. How we train and
safety and mind. >> Alright.

23
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:44,875
Little bit about what we want to
talk about today. We wanted to
talk about things like ADSB. You

24
00:02:44,875 --> 00:02:51,708
may have heard about it, ADS-A,
its kinda similar but different,
ACARS, transponders, collision

25
00:02:51,708 --> 00:02:57,708
avoidance systems, how do they
work. A little bit about GPS,
you guys already know about GPS,

26
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:07,500
auto pilots, some avionics
busses and networks and some
attacks which you may have heard

27
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:13,500
about. So, you may have heard
about people saying, okay, I can
attack your airplane, take it

28
00:03:16,875 --> 00:03:22,875
over by hacking into the
avionics network via in flight
wifi or the entertainment

29
00:03:24,958 --> 00:03:30,417
network. We'll going to talk a
little bit about that and
examine is that true or is that

30
00:03:30,417 --> 00:03:36,625
not true or is it kinda true.
We'll talk a little bit about
ADSB hacking, also talk about

31
00:03:36,625 --> 00:03:42,625
things like engine system
monitors, ACARS, what it is how
you might be able to exploit it,

32
00:03:46,375 --> 00:03:53,375
etc. Alright, so let me get this
out of the way to start with.
One thing that everyone needs to

33
00:03:53,375 --> 00:03:58,042
understand you cannot over ride
the pilot. Alright, you cannot
over ride the pilots inputs on

34
00:03:58,042 --> 00:04:04,042
flight controls. That system is
closed, you know, even if it is
fly by wire. Believe it or not

35
00:04:12,625 --> 00:04:18,208
some of these airliners still
use cables for some of their
controls. For example, the

36
00:04:18,208 --> 00:04:24,833
Embraer regional jet actually
uses cables for the elevator
controls so it's not even fly by

37
00:04:24,833 --> 00:04:31,875
wire completely. But, also
something you should understand
is that all of these airplanes

38
00:04:31,875 --> 00:04:37,125
do feature mechanical backup
instruments. Now, I'm not going
to say that the pilots still

39
00:04:37,125 --> 00:04:44,625
know how to use them, I'm just
going to say they're there.
(Laughter) >> Right >> You can't

40
00:04:44,625 --> 00:04:51,042
really hack a mechanical
altimeter or an attitude
indicator, et cetra, et cetra. I

41
00:04:51,042 --> 00:04:55,875
said, you can but I should have
said you may be able to affect
the auto pilot. But if the

42
00:04:58,958 --> 00:05:04,958
pilots notice what's going on
they'll disconnect the auto
pilot and Polly can tell you

43
00:05:04,958 --> 00:05:10,250
there's at least nine different
ways to do that. In addition to
that, you can overpower the auto

44
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:16,250
pilot and there are limits on
what's allowed for certified
aircraft. For example, if you

45
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:26,458
have an airline pilot that's a
size zero model and she
moonlights as a airline captain,

46
00:05:26,458 --> 00:05:34,000
she can still throw all of her
90 pounds on that control yolk
and overpower the auto pilot.

47
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:40,375
Also, you should realize that if
you try to do something to hack
into the auto pilot you're most

48
00:05:40,375 --> 00:05:46,208
likely going to generate some
sort of alert that, again,
hopefully pilots would notice.

49
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Little bit of background talking
about avionics networks. In the
olden times, people used

50
00:05:57,667 --> 00:06:03,042
something called ARINC 429 which
is a standard for
interconnecting avionics

51
00:06:03,042 --> 00:06:09,042
systems. In the bottom corner
you'll see a little picture of a
PCM CIA card that says 429 on it

52
00:06:12,583 --> 00:06:18,042
and this is something that you
could use on a laptop if you
were going to test a piece of

53
00:06:18,042 --> 00:06:25,125
avionics that uses ARINC 429. By
the way today we're going to
talk a lot about ARINC

54
00:06:25,125 --> 00:06:30,458
standards. It's a really old
company that's been doing stuff
in aviation and they've

55
00:06:30,458 --> 00:06:36,458
developed all these standards
that everybody uses, so you'll
see that a lot. Now, ARINC 429

56
00:06:39,542 --> 00:06:46,250
is not really connected to
anything useful for our
purposes. And it requires some

57
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:52,167
specialized hardware. Some
people said, you know, buying
proprietary stuff so you can

58
00:06:52,167 --> 00:06:58,000
test all these avionics is a
pain in the butt, let's do
something better. Let's do

59
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:05,000
something based on COTS, common
off the shelf stuff. And that's
what where we get into our

60
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:11,000
discussion of ARINC 664 which in
certain airplanes basically if
it's an airbus, they call it

61
00:07:13,375 --> 00:07:19,375
AFDX, which is essentially the
same thing. So, what is this
AFDX or ARINC 664. Technically

62
00:07:23,958 --> 00:07:29,958
it's 664 part seven networking
but nobody cares. It's built on
ether net but you can't just

63
00:07:33,625 --> 00:07:40,458
start sending packets. You know,
it's like saying I have a
videocassette, can you, can you

64
00:07:40,458 --> 00:07:46,458
play it. Sure I can. Oh, it's
beta max and it's PAL.
(Laughter) >>All right. So,

65
00:07:50,625 --> 00:07:58,500
yeah, it's the same but
different. Something you should
know is never wireless. These

66
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:03,667
avionics networks are never
wireless networks. They do have
some security in place. They're

67
00:08:03,667 --> 00:08:07,375
not connected to things like the
entertainment system and they're
not connected to anything

68
00:08:07,375 --> 00:08:13,375
wireless. Alright. So, ARINC 664
or AFDX is something that was
based on ARINC 629. 629's kind

69
00:08:22,083 --> 00:08:28,083
of like 429 but different, right
and the 629 was first found in
the Boeing 777 and pretty much

70
00:08:32,333 --> 00:08:38,750
that's the only place you'll see
it. Nobody else uses it. It's
only found in that one aircraft.

71
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:44,750
Boeing is going on like the 787
uses 664 instead but as I said
before, this allows you to use

72
00:08:49,667 --> 00:08:55,208
your nice common off the shelf
components so that it's easier
to find chips and things in

73
00:08:55,208 --> 00:09:02,875
order to build your avionics.
Built on internet but not the
same thing. One of the big

74
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:08,125
differences that you'll find
with this is that it uses two
redundant channels and we'll

75
00:09:08,125 --> 00:09:15,125
talk more about that in a bit
and also it assigns time slices
to avoid collisions and to make

76
00:09:15,125 --> 00:09:22,542
things terministic. Ether net is
great and we all understand it,
we all understand how to use it

77
00:09:22,542 --> 00:09:28,792
but one of the issues for this
case for using trait up ether
net is you don't know how long

78
00:09:28,792 --> 00:09:33,208
it's going to take for your
packets to arrive and that's a
problem if you are trying to do

79
00:09:33,208 --> 00:09:39,208
something like move a flight
control. Also in the ARINC 664
standard is this idea of virtual

80
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:51,333
links. So, essentially what you
can do, you can have multiple
links on the same wires and each

81
00:09:51,333 --> 00:09:56,708
of these links is a
unidirectional logical pipe.
Every one of them has one and

82
00:09:56,708 --> 00:10:04,417
only one sender and one or more
receivers. And as I said, you
have some time slicing that's

83
00:10:04,417 --> 00:10:11,917
done to avoid collisions and you
have to decide how much
bandwidth you want to assign to

84
00:10:11,917 --> 00:10:18,833
each of these pipes. There's
only so much bandwidth on the
wire and if you have multiple

85
00:10:18,833 --> 00:10:26,000
things that are going to be
used, you have to decide, all
right, I'm going to use this

86
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:32,750
much bandwidth or whatever.
Playing music, downloading music
over A cars, you can't really do

87
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:38,750
that but and then there's also
the idea of jitter. Jitter is
just the maximum difference in

88
00:10:41,833 --> 00:10:49,750
timing for those packets to
arrive. And it's based on things
such as how many virtual links

89
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:55,750
are on the wire and what the
bandwidth is assigned to each of
them. Alright. So, a connection

90
00:11:01,542 --> 00:11:07,542
on AFDX would look kind of like
this on the left. Hopefully
that's not fuzzy. It's a little

91
00:11:09,625 --> 00:11:17,333
fuzzy on my monitor up here, but
you have a couple of pieces of
avionics and each of them has 2

92
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:23,333
ether net adapters an A channel
and a B channel. And logically
you have kind of a nick, if you

93
00:11:27,833 --> 00:11:33,833
will, inside each of these
avionics pieces and they have
these two channels but logically

94
00:11:37,583 --> 00:11:43,583
inside the avionics it looks
like just 1ether net channel and
in order to connect to -- I

95
00:11:48,167 --> 00:11:54,125
think we might have a brief
pause here. >> Oh no, keep
going. >> Okay. As I was saying,

96
00:11:54,125 --> 00:12:00,125
in order to -- >> Security
alert. >> Captain Polly is
looking worried. Security. Never

97
00:12:03,417 --> 00:12:09,417
mind. >> What does any of this
mean? Go ahead. >> What does
anything mean? Alright. So, only

98
00:12:12,458 --> 00:12:18,292
thing you should realize is that
there always needs to be an
avionics switch of some sort. >>

99
00:12:18,292 --> 00:12:25,083
No, no, no, no, no. That's
wrong. (Laughter). >> I'm sorry,
go ahead. Go ahead. >> Okay.

100
00:12:25,083 --> 00:12:31,042
(Laughter). >> You should have
run this by me before you
started speaking, right. Nothing

101
00:12:31,042 --> 00:12:38,917
can be done about that now. >>
It's not my first time. >> Ooh.
You know what, second -- still

102
00:12:38,917 --> 00:12:43,375
in tune on the speaker. >> Raise
your hand if you're a first time
speaker. >> All right. >> Thanks

103
00:12:43,375 --> 00:12:49,375
for that by the way. >> Now we
can't talk for eight hours. >>
Eight hours at least. (Laughter)

104
00:13:07,875 --> 00:13:13,875
>> So, as I was saying , there's
no equivalent to a crossover
cable in these situations.

105
00:13:18,417 --> 00:13:23,667
Pretty much you're going to have
to go to an avionics switch even
if you have just two pieces of

106
00:13:23,667 --> 00:13:29,667
avionics which you would never
have that situation anyway. But
looking a little bit at ARINC

107
00:13:33,583 --> 00:13:39,583
664 in real life, this is a
partial diagram for a
undisclosed airliner and you'll

108
00:13:44,458 --> 00:13:49,958
notice that some of the links
are highlighted in yellow and
those are the two wave lengths.

109
00:13:49,958 --> 00:13:55,958
So those are the 664 links
between the flight management
system and some flight computers

110
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:05,083
and some other stuff. And if you
don't think this is pretty
tightly integrated, this next

111
00:14:05,083 --> 00:14:11,917
picture will kind of give you an
idea that, again, this is only a
partial diagram from some

112
00:14:11,917 --> 00:14:17,917
unknown airliner, and you'll see
that there's quite a bit of data
floating around on these busses.

113
00:14:22,375 --> 00:14:26,125
The other thing you should
realize, the number of 664
networks varies from one

114
00:14:26,125 --> 00:14:32,125
aircraft to the next. Some of
these networks are twisted pair,
some of them are fibers, some of

115
00:14:35,917 --> 00:14:43,083
them are coax even. All of these
where allowed and they
interoperate and typically these

116
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:49,083
switches will translate between
the different media connection
and such. Let's talk about

117
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:57,500
entertainment systems. A lot of
talk has been about these
entertainment systems. If you

118
00:15:01,167 --> 00:15:08,583
look at the in seat displays and
you see, oh, this is where we're
going, this is where we've been

119
00:15:08,583 --> 00:15:14,417
kind of thing, nice little maps,
something pretty to watch, of
course we find on some of them

120
00:15:14,417 --> 00:15:18,000
like Spirit -- well, they didn't
even have that but if they did
I'm sure there would be a credit

121
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:24,000
card reader. I flew out on
Spirit. I'm waiting for them to
have a credit card reader for

122
00:15:26,208 --> 00:15:32,208
the toilet paper in the lav ,
you know. Just better hold it.
Alright. So, it's connected to

123
00:15:35,917 --> 00:15:43,458
output ports on the GPS and FMS,
the flight management system, or
thorough something called a NED,

124
00:15:43,458 --> 00:15:48,833
a network extension device.
We'll talk more about those in a
bit. One thing you should

125
00:15:48,833 --> 00:15:56,750
realize though these are never
connected to that ARINC 429, 629
or 664 network. There's no

126
00:15:56,750 --> 00:16:02,750
reason for this to be connected
and also remember it's never
wireless and it's not compatible

127
00:16:05,917 --> 00:16:11,917
with your everyday friendly
TCPIP. You might wonder why do I
have a picture of a VGA port.

128
00:16:14,542 --> 00:16:21,208
This kind of emphasizes the
point, this is an output it is
connected to so, you know,

129
00:16:21,208 --> 00:16:27,667
trying to hack it and trying to
get to the FMS through this
avenue is kind of like trying to

130
00:16:27,667 --> 00:16:33,917
hack into your computer through
the VGA port. You know, it's --
you can send signals there but

131
00:16:33,917 --> 00:16:39,917
if nobody's listening, nobody's
listening. Alright. Here's a
picture of one example in flight

132
00:16:43,542 --> 00:16:48,208
entertainment system. You can
see kind of how it's connected
and there's a server that serves

133
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:55,625
up stuff to the passengers, et
cetera, et cetera. And down in
the corner is a picture of one

134
00:16:55,625 --> 00:17:03,500
commercially available in flight
entertainment system. Alright. I
want to talk a little bit about

135
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:09,917
the 777. There's been some
confusion around the 777 in
particular, because of a little

136
00:17:09,917 --> 00:17:16,417
flight -- any one ever heard of
, what is it? >>Malaysian Air
370. >>Malaysian Air 370? Any

137
00:17:16,417 --> 00:17:22,417
one heard anything about that?
There's been a lot of confusion
around this. And here's what the

138
00:17:22,417 --> 00:17:28,417
situation is. Alright, so Boeing
went to the FAA and they asked
them for a special condition to

139
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:37,500
allow passenger information
network to get some sort of
connection to networks such as

140
00:17:39,542 --> 00:17:47,083
the aircraft information
network. So, in November of last
year, FAA granted them a special

141
00:17:47,083 --> 00:17:53,083
condition which basically said,
okay, you may now do this. They
provided that they could use one

142
00:17:55,542 --> 00:18:02,750
of these Neds, network extension
devices, as long as they met
certain conditions. So, what are

143
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:08,708
those certain conditions, those
special conditions? This is what
they said. The applicant must

144
00:18:08,708 --> 00:18:14,458
ensure that the design provides
isolation from or airplane
electronic system security

145
00:18:14,458 --> 00:18:20,458
protection against, access by
bad people basically. Alright.
And that's where the NED comes

146
00:18:24,875 --> 00:18:30,875
in. The NED is a Gateway and
essentially what it does is it
translates whatever protocol is

147
00:18:35,125 --> 00:18:41,125
being used on the avionics
busses, be it ARINC 429, 629 or
664 into IP, basically into

148
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:52,458
something that everybody else
understands. So, like any
Gateway, each of these pathways

149
00:18:52,458 --> 00:18:58,333
has to get programmed. Alright,
so that's one thing you need to
realize. So, you can't just say,

150
00:18:58,333 --> 00:19:04,625
well, I'm going send stuff to
this Gateway. Again, even if you
could send something to this

151
00:19:04,625 --> 00:19:09,667
Gateway, if nobody is listening,
nobody is listening. You know,
it's like the tree that falls in

152
00:19:09,667 --> 00:19:16,000
the forest. Do you still have to
pay taxes on it? (Laughter). 

153
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:22,000
>>> So, the other thing you need
realize is that the FMS does not
receive any input from the NED.

154
00:19:24,125 --> 00:19:29,333
You know, it might output
information such as where is the
plane now, where is the plane

155
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:35,333
going to the NED, so you can't
send bogus commands to an FMS
through this NED, because it

156
00:19:40,542 --> 00:19:48,250
doesn't listen for commands from
the NED. Now, I will say this. A
possible attack factor, if you

157
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:54,250
did compromise the NED, you
might be able to impersonate
another device that the FMS does

158
00:19:56,750 --> 00:20:02,625
listen to. Alright, I'm never
going to say everything is
impossible, I'm just trying to

159
00:20:02,625 --> 00:20:08,625
say that you can't compromise
the NED and talk directly to the
FMS. You might be able to fake

160
00:20:11,125 --> 00:20:17,125
it out a little bit but, again,
in the end, you got the pilots
there to protect you from weird

161
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:25,250
stuff and hopefully they pay
attention, don't fall asleep,
overfly the airport 'cause

162
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:32,875
that's never happened.
(Laughter). >> Exactly. Alright.
Here's an example NED which I

163
00:20:32,875 --> 00:20:38,625
shamelessly took off of Tela 9
Controls web site without
permission but hey it's out

164
00:20:38,625 --> 00:20:44,625
there. And from here you can see
that the black lines, in this
case its an ERIC 429 NED, you

165
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:57,208
can see a black line coming from
the FMS to the NED but you do
not see any corresponding return

166
00:20:57,208 --> 00:21:03,208
path to the FMS. So, let's talk
a little bit about Malaysia 370.
What was this plane? It was a

167
00:21:12,125 --> 00:21:18,125
777. A 777 using ARINC 629 and
as we said, it's not the same --
I mean, it's a 777. They're the

168
00:21:24,875 --> 00:21:31,750
only ones that ever use the 629.
It's not really the 664 that
we've been talking about mostly,

169
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:37,208
so it's not ethernet, it's
really not ethernet. It's not as
close to ethernet that you're

170
00:21:37,208 --> 00:21:43,208
used to as 664. So, because this
is the only plane that uses 629
and because it's really not

171
00:21:53,417 --> 00:22:00,083
ethernet, it's even further
away, that makes it a little bit
harder to hack. I realize it's

172
00:22:00,083 --> 00:22:06,083
somewhat security, but, yeah --
I'm not saying it's impossible.
Nothing's impossible but it's a

173
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:16,250
lot harder. And I'll let Polly
talk about this next slide here.
>> So, Dr. Phil thought since I

174
00:22:18,292 --> 00:22:23,542
was the newbe you guys might
give me a few less jeers than
you would him, boos. So, we real

175
00:22:23,542 --> 00:22:30,333
did try hard. We thought we were
close. But for proprietary
reasons we weren't able to get

176
00:22:30,333 --> 00:22:34,083
any of the manufacturers to
share their goodies, so what we
did what we have is even better

177
00:22:34,083 --> 00:22:41,458
for you. We have -- we're going
to move from schematics to
dramatics. We have just a movie

178
00:22:41,458 --> 00:22:47,458
clip of what this might look
like if passengers in the back
were trying to hack into the

179
00:22:51,625 --> 00:22:57,625
input entertainment wireless
system. >> Hello. Welcome to how
to hack into and take control.

180
00:23:00,083 --> 00:23:08,000
(Laughter) >>Step one, trying to
get access to the plane's
navigation system, try to

181
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:14,000
utilize the plane's in flight
entertainment system. >> ¶¶ 

182
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:19,667
>>> This is near to impossible.
But with enough typing
(Laughter) >> buzz words, such

183
00:23:19,667 --> 00:23:21,667
as I'm in and rerouting the
network, also (Laughter) 

184
00:23:21,667 --> 00:23:27,667
>>> We can make it seem like the
in flight entertainment and
navigation systems are connected

185
00:23:30,042 --> 00:23:36,042
and thus frighten an air marshal
enough to incapacitate you .
(Laughter). >> With enough

186
00:23:42,625 --> 00:23:48,625
hacking one could be able to
sign onto the planes WIFI for
free. >> And just by the way,

187
00:23:57,208 --> 00:24:03,208
all of the actors were pilots.
>> No real tasers were used, no
pilots were harmed in the

188
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:12,458
filming of this. Alright, and
you know, that was meant to be a
bit humorous, so hopefully you

189
00:24:12,458 --> 00:24:19,583
found it so. Also just to
reinforce the point, the in
flight wireless is not connected

190
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:25,583
in any meaningful way to the
system, so good luck trying to
get in that way. I want to shift

191
00:24:25,583 --> 00:24:31,375
gears a little bit, talk a
little bit about ADS-B and
ADS-A. Some of the things that

192
00:24:31,375 --> 00:24:37,375
you can do. ADS-B is a pretty
well known protocol. There's
been some other talks about it.

193
00:24:39,708 --> 00:24:45,792
If you look at the slide down in
the bottom left, you'll see a
board that you can use to

194
00:24:45,792 --> 00:24:51,792
receive encode ADS-B signals,
even send your own and on the
right, is a commercial unit that

195
00:24:58,958 --> 00:25:01,833
you might find in a small
aircraft that's a GPS/ADS-B
unit. For receiving and sending

196
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:08,792
ADS-B signals. Actually I think
that one only receives ADS-B. As
others have said it's true

197
00:25:08,792 --> 00:25:15,250
there's no security in this
protocol. You can create phantom
aircraft, you can create bogus

198
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:22,083
ADS-B transmissions all day
long. You could even create fake
weather reports if you so choose

199
00:25:22,083 --> 00:25:29,042
or if you're just really
frustrated, you could always jam
it. You can jam any frequency.

200
00:25:29,042 --> 00:25:35,792
However, as we're going to talk
about in a bit it's not likely
to affect any kind of traffic or

201
00:25:35,792 --> 00:25:41,542
collision avoidance system and
there's some reasons for that.
So, little bit more about ADS-B.

202
00:25:41,542 --> 00:25:48,417
ADS-B is automatic dependent
surveillance broadcast, that's
what B is for, and this was

203
00:25:48,417 --> 00:25:55,958
piloted in Alaska and it was
intended to improve the
situation where there's not a

204
00:25:55,958 --> 00:26:01,958
lot of radar coverage. Alaska is
a very large state and it's not
very populous. This is part of a

205
00:26:05,333 --> 00:26:11,250
long-term goal for a system
that's known as free flight
that's planned for the future

206
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:19,000
and the idea is that eventually
aircraft would be able to kind
of negotiate with each other in

207
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:25,000
order to avoid collisions, et
cetera, et cetera. It can
provide traffic and weather in

208
00:26:27,375 --> 00:26:33,750
places where that's available
and it's used by small planes to
broadcast their positions. The

209
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:41,125
corner picture is actually of an
ADS-B out unit. This is
something that's been mandated

210
00:26:41,125 --> 00:26:47,125
by the FAA for small aircraft to
have by 2020. >> 2020. >> 2020,
yes. Alright. Now, there is

211
00:26:52,583 --> 00:26:58,583
something similar but different
to ADS-B it's called ADS-A, all
right. And you might hear people

212
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:06,833
talk about ADS-B. The one thing
you need to realize is the
airlines use ADS-A. This is

213
00:27:06,833 --> 00:27:12,833
related to the ACARS system
we'll going to talk about as
well. And it's like this. ADS-B

214
00:27:14,917 --> 00:27:20,917
is kind of like a cable ready TV
and ADS-A is a cable box.
Alright. It's addressable so you

215
00:27:23,875 --> 00:27:30,750
can do things like pay per view
movies for the cable box. For
ADS-A it allows specific

216
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:37,708
aircraft to send and receive
messages and it allows lower
separation outside of radar

217
00:27:37,708 --> 00:27:44,250
coverage through a system called
FANS, the future air navigation
system and essentially what this

218
00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:50,833
means if you look at an airliner
that's flying over the ocean in
times past this separation

219
00:27:50,833 --> 00:27:57,792
between airliners was fairly
large because they're over the
ocean and there's no radar

220
00:27:57,792 --> 00:28:05,333
coverage. With something like
FANS reporting their position
through ADS-A, which sometimes

221
00:28:05,333 --> 00:28:11,333
is called ADS-C for -- I just
forgot. You can look it up. It
will report into the FANS system

222
00:28:17,167 --> 00:28:21,958
and that allows them to be a
little bit closer which means
more traffic going through, et

223
00:28:21,958 --> 00:28:29,792
cetera, et cetera. Another thing
you should realize is that
airliners use neither ADS-B or

224
00:28:29,792 --> 00:28:36,417
ADS-A for collision avoidance.
They do other stuff. Other
things about the transmissions,

225
00:28:36,417 --> 00:28:42,417
ADS-A transmissions and also the
ACARS transmissions, they can
either be VHF, HF or satellite

226
00:28:46,875 --> 00:28:53,000
and it really depends where they
are. If you're over lands and
over the United States, it's

227
00:28:53,000 --> 00:29:00,208
probably VHF. If you're over
Europe it might be HF. If you're
over the arctic, might be HF and

228
00:29:00,208 --> 00:29:04,792
if you're in the middle of
nowhere, it's probably
satellite. And they selectively

229
00:29:04,792 --> 00:29:10,792
choose which media they're going
to use based on things like cost
and speed. Alright. So,

230
00:29:13,167 --> 00:29:20,000
collision avoidance, when you
look at collision avoidance
system is primarily small

231
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:27,417
aircraft you might see something
called TRISB, traffic
information service B, and this

232
00:29:27,417 --> 00:29:34,458
is a service that's provided by
air traffic control and it
requires you to have either a

233
00:29:34,458 --> 00:29:40,458
mode S transponder or ADS-B in
and sometimes you have both of
those things. It's only

234
00:29:43,208 --> 00:29:49,542
available in some areas. It's
also not authoritative. What
that means if you're flying

235
00:29:49,542 --> 00:29:56,875
along in a plane equipped with
TISB and air traffic control
says hey, you have traffic at

236
00:29:56,875 --> 00:30:02,875
your 1:00 o'clock 2 miles, you
can't say, I have the traffic
unless you can physically see

237
00:30:04,917 --> 00:30:11,458
them. So, it's not an
authoritative system. The other
important thing to know is that

238
00:30:11,458 --> 00:30:17,458
this does not use the ADS-B
signals from others. And ATC
does not automatically relay

239
00:30:21,583 --> 00:30:27,583
every ADS-B signal they receive.
So, we talked earlier about the
fact that you can very easily

240
00:30:30,875 --> 00:30:36,875
take a board and you can
generate ADS-B messages and send
them out. The problem with that

241
00:30:39,167 --> 00:30:45,625
is those signals are probably
going to get ignored. If there's
not a corresponding radar blip

242
00:30:45,625 --> 00:30:51,833
somewhere that corresponds to
that aircraft, most likely ATC
is going to ignore that

243
00:30:51,833 --> 00:30:59,292
transmission. Also, again,
they're not going to pick up
that transmission, so they're

244
00:30:59,292 --> 00:31:07,000
not going to send it to somebody
else who might be running TISB
in their aircraft. Other kinds

245
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:13,083
of collision avoidance, some of
the small planes use something
called TCAD I think they named

246
00:31:13,083 --> 00:31:17,458
it this because it sounded like
T Cass and they thought you
might give them more money for

247
00:31:17,458 --> 00:31:24,500
their stuff and it provides some
information. Again it's not
authoritative and what T CAD

248
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:30,542
does is it essentially just
listens for transponders around
it and then it goes, hey, I

249
00:31:30,542 --> 00:31:37,000
heard a transponder over here,
don't go over there or gives you
some sort of indication as to

250
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:44,250
traffic around you. Now, the big
boys, biz jets and upward they
have something called TCATS. So

251
00:31:44,250 --> 00:31:51,208
let's talk about TCATS. By the
way, its just backing up here a
second, the display on the

252
00:31:51,208 --> 00:31:58,333
bottom is a T CAT display.
Sometimes people call it the
fish finder. You'll hear people

253
00:31:58,333 --> 00:32:04,333
say I got them on the fish
finder sometimes incorrectly
pilots especially if their name

254
00:32:04,333 --> 00:32:11,167
is Joe, that's a little private
joke with me Polly, will say I
have them on the fish finder.

255
00:32:11,167 --> 00:32:18,083
They don't have a fish finder
and that's not legal for them to
call it traffic. But T CATS.

256
00:32:18,083 --> 00:32:24,667
What does T CATS do, it uses the
transponders around it and
unlike T CAD and these other

257
00:32:24,667 --> 00:32:31,792
systems, it can actively
interrogate other transponders.
If you ever look at a radar

258
00:32:31,792 --> 00:32:39,625
system you see the big typically
red parabolic antenna that's
rotating, on top of that you

259
00:32:39,625 --> 00:32:44,042
might see another antenna array
often painted white and that
antenna array on the top is

260
00:32:44,042 --> 00:32:50,042
sending out another signal and
then transponders are responding
back to it. And they're saying,

261
00:32:54,208 --> 00:33:00,208
oh, I'm over here and we'll talk
a little bit about them in just
a second. But a T CAT system can

262
00:33:02,542 --> 00:33:09,792
actively query other
transponders. So, how this
works, for example, if I'm

263
00:33:09,792 --> 00:33:16,625
sitting at the airport ready to
take off and a biz jet or larger
and comes in to land, I can look

264
00:33:16,625 --> 00:33:22,833
at my transponder and I will see
the reply light continuously
illuminated indicating that

265
00:33:22,833 --> 00:33:30,625
somebody keeps pinging my
transponder. Now, this is an
authoritative system which means

266
00:33:30,625 --> 00:33:36,625
they do not have to actually
physically see you to say that
they have you as traffic. And

267
00:33:39,042 --> 00:33:44,792
that's a good thing. Now, it
might be a little bit hard to
see but down in the corner you

268
00:33:44,792 --> 00:33:51,667
see an example of what we call
an RA, a resolution advisory. >>
Advisory. >> Advisory. And it

269
00:33:51,667 --> 00:33:57,667
says in red traffic, traffic and
it has some information. In
addition to this you'll have a

270
00:34:00,292 --> 00:34:07,292
nice lovely voice in the cockpit
also telling you, traffic,
traffic and in some cases a

271
00:34:07,292 --> 00:34:12,083
recommended action as well. If
they're really close. >> And the
voice does get more and more

272
00:34:12,083 --> 00:34:18,083
excited the closer the traffic
gets. >> Is it a sexy voice? >>
I don't tend to think it's sexy.

273
00:34:21,750 --> 00:34:28,667
>> Yeah, military aircraft, they
actually like to use female
voices because they found that

274
00:34:28,667 --> 00:34:34,250
military pilots respond better.
Maybe they used to listen to
their mom. So, one of my friends

275
00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:40,917
did some work on an undisclosed
fighter plane and he did some
work on the system known as

276
00:34:40,917 --> 00:34:48,458
bitching Betty. And bitching
Betty would tell you about your
fuel situation and how you

277
00:34:48,458 --> 00:34:54,625
needed to go back before you ran
out of gas and landed in the
ocean. So, transponders -- here

278
00:34:54,625 --> 00:35:01,625
I got a couple examples. Up at
the top is an example
transponder off of Boeing, I

279
00:35:01,625 --> 00:35:07,625
think 737, but don't quote me.
And in the bottom we have a
couple of general aviation

280
00:35:10,333 --> 00:35:16,667
transponders. On the left we
have a nice one from Garmin with
a digital display and if any of

281
00:35:16,667 --> 00:35:21,750
you are pilots in the room,
you've probably seen the old
school ones with the little

282
00:35:21,750 --> 00:35:27,250
twisty knobs on the right.
Alright. And these have
different modes of operation.

283
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:33,250
The most basic mode is called
mode A and in mode A, what
happens is it will send out a

284
00:35:37,625 --> 00:35:41,833
ping and you'll respond and
you'll give them that code on
the front. By the way, they

285
00:35:41,833 --> 00:35:48,458
actually are the only people
that I know of that use octal.
So it's an octal system, so each

286
00:35:48,458 --> 00:35:55,000
of those numbers goes up to
seven. So it's a 4,096 code
transponder. Alright. So,

287
00:35:55,000 --> 00:36:01,000
there's also the ability to send
your altitude which is what we
call mode C and then there's

288
00:36:03,333 --> 00:36:08,292
mode S which is the selective
system. The other thing you
should know is that airliners

289
00:36:08,292 --> 00:36:14,292
have at least two of these by
regulation. They must. And I'll
turn it over to Polly. >> Okay.

290
00:36:16,417 --> 00:36:22,083
So, this next clip is just going
to show you that attacking the
ADS-B may possibly be harassing

291
00:36:22,083 --> 00:36:27,250
but I'm going to let it speak
for itself here. >> Force the
plane to reroute to another

292
00:36:27,250 --> 00:36:31,833
location or at least harass the
flight crew. Simply, have your
have your pilot friends fly

293
00:36:31,833 --> 00:36:37,250
multiple planes front, behind
and around the plane you would
like. Have said plane send beep

294
00:36:37,250 --> 00:36:42,375
transponders signals to the
hijacked plane and force it to
react to resolution advisories.

295
00:36:42,375 --> 00:36:48,375
The crew may possibly reroute to
another location. (Laughter). >>
Seems like a lot of work, I

296
00:37:02,417 --> 00:37:08,417
wonder if we could borrow that
one. >> In actuality here's what
would happen. >> ADS-B attack.

297
00:37:24,333 --> 00:37:30,333
>> Interceeded . >> Be advised
that nobody could hack into the
airplane, that would be....

298
00:37:39,167 --> 00:37:45,167
(Laughter). >> Alright. So,
technically that was two kinds
of attacks. Yes, you could --

299
00:37:49,208 --> 00:37:55,417
again, you could attack the
collision avoidance systems but
because they use directional

300
00:37:55,417 --> 00:38:02,500
antennas in an array, you can't
just beam signals at them.
Alright. You can't beam ADS-B

301
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:09,125
signals. Transponder replies or
whatever at them. You would have
to beam signals from multiple

302
00:38:09,125 --> 00:38:14,708
directions and it would be
fairly complicated and if the
plane that you're trying to

303
00:38:14,708 --> 00:38:19,375
target is a lot faster than your
friend's plane that's going to
be pretty challenging. >> The

304
00:38:19,375 --> 00:38:24,042
Lego plane would have a really
hard timekeeping up. >> I don't
know. Luke Skywalker 's got R2

305
00:38:24,042 --> 00:38:30,042
D-2 helping out. I don't know.
Maybe he would be okay. Kind of
our last topic we want to talk

306
00:38:32,833 --> 00:38:38,833
about ACARS and such. Engine
systems, engine monitors and
such might be hooked up to this

307
00:38:40,833 --> 00:38:47,417
ACARS system and you may have
heard things about the 370
flight, people saying, well,

308
00:38:47,417 --> 00:38:55,000
there were these pings, right,
these pings that were coming on
after the plane had disappeared.

309
00:38:55,000 --> 00:39:00,125
And I believe what they're
probably talking about are these
ACARS messages and the way that

310
00:39:00,125 --> 00:39:07,333
this is normally set up, a lot
of the systems in the plane will
send messages back home either

311
00:39:07,333 --> 00:39:14,125
to the manufacturer or the
airlines just giving them status
information. By the way there's

312
00:39:14,125 --> 00:39:19,792
also some boring stuff that
comes across ACARS like hey the
lav's broken, you know stuff

313
00:39:19,792 --> 00:39:25,792
like that. >> Stuff like company
for a drug test after you land.
>> That's not fun especially if

314
00:39:27,875 --> 00:39:30,792
you just had a shot. >> Alright.
So, sometimes control systems,
people have talked about well

315
00:39:30,792 --> 00:39:36,792
could I hack into the engine
control systems. One thing you
need realize about the engine

316
00:39:40,042 --> 00:39:47,250
control systems is that all of
them have a purely mechanical
backup and in most cases the

317
00:39:47,250 --> 00:39:52,167
controls themselves are actually
in the mechanical with an
electronic system that is used

318
00:39:52,167 --> 00:39:59,625
to trim it. This is kind of a
general theme in aviation in
that we always like to have

319
00:39:59,625 --> 00:40:05,000
things that are safe, not
necessarily most efficient so
the idea is that if the

320
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:10,500
electronic system were to fail,
the engines would continue to
operate, just not perhaps

321
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:16,500
maximal efficiency. Alright.
ACARS is a system that's used to
send messages to and from the

322
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:25,250
ground. It can be used to and
from people or systems and it's
used to send things like weather

323
00:40:28,042 --> 00:40:35,417
information, delays, updated
flight plans, maintenance
information as we just said, and

324
00:40:35,417 --> 00:40:41,833
here in the pictures you see a
display with an ACARS message
and then there's always a

325
00:40:41,833 --> 00:40:47,167
printer, like a little ticker
tape, so if you look at the
bottom picture in the corner

326
00:40:47,167 --> 00:40:53,500
you'll notice a little printer
between the pilots that will
print out all these ACARS

327
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:59,500
messages that come along. Now,
you could create a bogus flight
plan update. You could create

328
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:10,000
bogus weather. I know that there
was a talk recently, last couple
days, talking about some SATCOM

329
00:41:13,542 --> 00:41:19,667
systems that have some
vulnerabilities and those surely
exist and it is certainly true

330
00:41:19,667 --> 00:41:25,917
that you could send out bogus
ACARS messages. The real
question that you have to answer

331
00:41:25,917 --> 00:41:31,917
is what will happen as a result
of those messages and we'll talk
about that here in a second. And

332
00:41:34,750 --> 00:41:41,500
in my opinion, I'd say that it's
not a very practical way to take
over an airplane and in the

333
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:47,500
picture you have an engine
display from an airliner and
what you'll notice again, you

334
00:41:50,625 --> 00:41:57,000
know, there's an output of
status information and the
period varies depending on the

335
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:04,667
system and the aircraft, you
know, but, say, every hour or so
might be typical information

336
00:42:04,667 --> 00:42:12,583
that's sent when it comes to
status information on the
engines and such, and then when

337
00:42:12,583 --> 00:42:18,875
they're on the ground, there's
additional information that can
be downloaded for more

338
00:42:18,875 --> 00:42:25,375
maintenance purposes. >> Cyber
security experts and airline
pilots have very much in common

339
00:42:25,375 --> 00:42:29,542
threat mitigation. There's
multiple levels of safety and
one that you are about to see

340
00:42:29,542 --> 00:42:35,583
here, every airline flight
that's in progress has a company
dispatcher that's behind them

341
00:42:35,583 --> 00:42:40,000
that they can communicate with
and pilots are supposed to ask
themselves does this seem

342
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:46,208
reasonable, does this make
sense, to do a gut check. >> She
must have had a big shot because

343
00:42:46,208 --> 00:42:51,833
she just went the wrong way in
the press. >> The video you'll
see here --the pilots catching

344
00:42:51,833 --> 00:42:57,708
it, that just doesn't make
sense. Let's check on this. >>
From the ground one may be able

345
00:42:57,708 --> 00:43:02,042
to take control of the flights
ACAR's message. Where a crew
receives flight plan

346
00:43:02,042 --> 00:43:08,042
modifications and ATC
clearances. >> We got an ACAR's
message. >> Emergency! Reroute

347
00:43:10,375 --> 00:43:16,375
plane to Cuba. We're... >> Make
sure to submit the orders to a
Pilot to verify a change in

348
00:43:22,458 --> 00:43:28,458
flight plan. I don't know about
that, we better verify that with
company. >> Hey company, this is

349
00:43:33,917 --> 00:43:39,917
2734 could you just confirm, we
just got an ACARS message saying
we need to reroute to Cuba. >>

350
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:52,000
No, that is incorrect, please
say on course. >> In conclusion,
hijacking an airplane is very

351
00:43:56,208 --> 00:44:03,583
serious and highly illegal and
requires a specific set of
circumstances that are very,

352
00:44:03,583 --> 00:44:09,583
very difficult. >> ¶¶ >> There
will be no cigars today, right?
(Applause). >> Alright. I was

353
00:44:15,042 --> 00:44:21,208
going say, you know, Polly went
backwards on the slides that's
why there's that eight-hour

354
00:44:21,208 --> 00:44:27,208
rule, you know. Okay, just some
closing thoughts. Nearly every
protocol that's used in aviation

355
00:44:31,458 --> 00:44:39,167
is unsecured. There's no
encryption on ACARS, there's no
encryption on ADS-B. By the way

356
00:44:39,167 --> 00:44:44,542
we didn't mention it but one of
the things that you'll see
sometimes come across ACARS, are

357
00:44:44,542 --> 00:44:50,542
things like passenger lists, so
not very private but anyway. And
there certainly is a lot of

358
00:44:53,917 --> 00:45:01,083
potential to annoy ATC and or
small aircraft and, you know,
there's an increasing level of

359
00:45:01,083 --> 00:45:08,375
automation with these unsecured
protocols in place and this
potentially could be problematic

360
00:45:08,375 --> 00:45:15,208
and definitely something that we
should continue to be aware of
as that level of automation

361
00:45:15,208 --> 00:45:21,833
increases. However, thankfully
there's a lot of checks and
balances and in a case of

362
00:45:21,833 --> 00:45:27,833
airlines we have two pilots on
every aircraft, so we have two
humans kind of in the mix that

363
00:45:31,167 --> 00:45:37,167
will hopefully keep us safe and
for now, I think we're pretty
safe. I feel pretty safe flying

364
00:45:39,333 --> 00:45:45,333
airliners. I don't have a
problem flying them, taking my
children, et cetera. Anyway, if

365
00:45:48,208 --> 00:45:54,750
you have any questions, you
know, come see us later. Hit us
up on twitter, I'm just P

366
00:45:54,750 --> 00:46:00,750
Polstra, I'm not very inventive
and Captain Polly. So thanks a
lot. >> Thank you. (Applause).

367
00:46:05,917 --> 00:46:07,917
>> Great job.
