1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,100
>>Now we are going to talk about
cars. I bought my first adult
car. A Volkswagen. Turns out

2
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:18,760
German cars are a long troll
just to take your money ‑‑ this
had all of the fancy stuff. I

3
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:28,200
used to listen to big timers in
college. They talked about frog
eye headlights which my car has.

4
00:00:28,208 --> 00:00:38,500
Then I hit a Coyote. There are
like 40 motors in the headlight
that go up and down. I had to keep taking

5
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:47,417
my car back and forth. My point
is: In cars these days all kinds
of shit can break and shit that

6
00:00:47,417 --> 00:00:52,667
might be really problematic.
That is what Charlie and Chris
and going to talk about right

7
00:00:52,667 --> 00:01:06,000
now. So, let's give these two a
big Party Track welcome.
(Applause) >> How's everyone

8
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:17,540
doing? Hangover's gone? Still
drunk? I think you all know
Charlie. He is kind of Internet

9
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:25,800
famous. He works at Twitter. I
am Chris Valasek. I work at IO
Active. We have been doing car

10
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:38,820
stuff a while. Nice enough to
have us here last year as well.
This year, Black Hat was

11
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:44,820
practice. Now the real thing. >>
Now we have the kinks out. We
can deliver the real deal. We

12
00:01:44,917 --> 00:01:56,417
have introductory stuff to go
over. How car attacks work. Talk
about cyber stuff. Then we will

13
00:01:56,417 --> 00:02:01,458
cruise through remote survey. If
you really want to read about
that stuff you should check the

14
00:02:01,458 --> 00:02:09,917
paper. It is already out. I will
release it on the blog next week
as well. 95 pages of details

15
00:02:09,917 --> 00:02:15,583
about all of the cars we looked
at, our thoughts and
conclusions. If you are really

16
00:02:15,583 --> 00:02:21,958
interested, this is our song and
dance ‑‑ read the paper. >> But
he who is going to do that? >> I

17
00:02:21,958 --> 00:02:33,318
wouldn't. I wrote it. >> Last
year: Four downloads. >> The
blog had like a zillion.

18
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:42,375
Reading's stupid. That is why I
watch movies. (Multiple voices).
>> Half a gig. That is why we

19
00:02:42,375 --> 00:02:48,458
never release the slides: They
are too hard to download.
Lastly, we will talk about some

20
00:02:48,458 --> 00:02:56,538
algorithms and a little device
that Charlie and I came up with
to stop the attacks that we have

21
00:02:56,542 --> 00:03:05,480
known about so far. There is not
going to be any remote shells.
More of academic. Except we

22
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:15,792
actually release stuff. It's
really motivated to talk about
remote attacks and ‑‑ Frankly it

23
00:03:15,792 --> 00:03:24,152
comes out to how we pick be our
cars for research which was very
scientific I would describe it.

24
00:03:24,167 --> 00:03:34,417
>> How much money can we have.
That is how we choose cars. >>
Computer control. After last

25
00:03:34,417 --> 00:03:39,042
year we wanted to do research
and talk about remote things.
(Off microphone). >> We were

26
00:03:39,042 --> 00:03:46,400
like let's do research on which
car to buy. >> That was probably
a little misguided first time

27
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:51,580
around. Turns out I was talking
to academic guys they
were like before we put a bought

28
00:03:51,583 --> 00:03:58,400
our car we bought all these,
manufacturers. Great idea. I
wish we would have done that.

29
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:03,740
Which cars park themselves?
sweet. Can we afford that? Let's
do it. >> This talk is really about the

30
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:14,040
research we did. We were doing it
like, Hey, other people might be
interested. Charlie had the

31
00:04:14,042 --> 00:04:19,750
special treat for you at the
end. Basically, the talk sucks.
But if you stay to the last five

32
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:25,542
minutes I promise it's all good.
Now a days, everyone seems
interested. As soon as there is

33
00:04:25,542 --> 00:04:34,417
a car wreck now the first
question ends up being: Was the
car hacked. We don't know. But

34
00:04:34,417 --> 00:04:41,417
everyone seems really interested
in this now. It is cool research
to do. Popping shells gets old

35
00:04:41,417 --> 00:04:49,250
at some point. You want to pop
something then smash it. That is
why I think we have had a blast

36
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:55,250
doing this. Got a lot of good
feedback and generally had a
good time. Remember when you

37
00:04:55,250 --> 00:05:09,370
crashed your car? >> Hacked. >>
Definitely hacked. >> We wanted
to get the facts out. If you are

38
00:05:17,333 --> 00:05:22,750
interested in remote attacks and
remott car research this is
going to tell you exactly what

39
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:30,583
you need to do. So you don't
have to listen to people who 
don't know ‑‑ you should

40
00:05:30,583 --> 00:05:36,708
be able to do that and wreck the
car and see from some of the
diagrams it is not really that

41
00:05:36,708 --> 00:05:42,042
straightforward. >> Right. >>
Some cars are one way, sop the
other. Not that straightforward

42
00:05:42,042 --> 00:05:50,582
some are less than others. Cars
have computers. Charlie and I
wanted to explain to you how

43
00:05:50,583 --> 00:06:01,458
attacks work and we hired Pixar
to do a little animation. This
was the budget. They were all

44
00:06:01,458 --> 00:06:07,917
hieroglyphic characters. They
were the cheapest. Here is how
the remote attack works: Shadowy

45
00:06:07,917 --> 00:06:15,957
guy with computer, he does
Internet to things or wireless
to things. From there, the ‑‑

46
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:20,167
you could potentially have code
running. That is what we are
concerned with. Not kind of

47
00:06:20,167 --> 00:06:26,750
eavesdropping and his E.
listening to things but want to
execute code on a computer. That

48
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:34,292
may be on the same network or a
different network which is
represented by the chip thing

49
00:06:34,292 --> 00:06:45,532
and that blue line. >> Step
one ‑‑ there are 310 steps in
remote attacks ‑‑ probably where

50
00:06:45,542 --> 00:06:51,542
the bluetooth stack lives At that
point, you can't necessarily do
harm to the car. You know ‑‑

51
00:06:58,417 --> 00:07:02,708
maybe you could record their
voice. We don't car about that.
We want to crash. >> Smash them

52
00:07:02,708 --> 00:07:11,458
up. After you figure out how to
get on the computer can you send
messages as well. While most

53
00:07:11,458 --> 00:07:15,500
cars have steering angle
sensors, a lot do not park
themselves. That might mean you

54
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:20,917
don't control steering at all.
You have to figure out what
parts of the automobile were

55
00:07:20,917 --> 00:07:26,625
controllable by computer
messages. While all of the parts
of the car are computerized

56
00:07:26,625 --> 00:07:32,460
doesn't mean the network
messages will be able to control
that all the time. >> That was

57
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:41,420
our research last year. Step one
. . . step two can you send
message from radio lands. Step

58
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:48,520
three can you make it do
something. Our whole research
was can you send messages. Can

59
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:57,792
you make it do something. >>
Step four: Smash E. 'em up. That
usually ends up being step four.

60
00:07:57,792 --> 00:08:05,042
People have done this already.
It is not theoretical to have
wireless codec of a car,

61
00:08:05,042 --> 00:08:10,400
physical aspects, take control.
The researchers from the
University of Washington and

62
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:16,400
University of California did
this in ‑‑ 2011 (Car sounds) >>
Beep‑beep‑beep. That was the

63
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:36,250
Internet. That looks dangerous.
Here is a test track (Making car
sounds) Look out. There is

64
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:43,290
something in the road. I hear
something.

65
00:08:54,400 --> 00:09:02,320
So what they showed was
something. They were able to get
execution ‑‑ able to lock the

66
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:12,292
breaks and crash the car. >> We
were plugged into the vehicle.
We kind of did some different

67
00:09:12,292 --> 00:09:21,732
things. We leveraged the actual
normal cam [phonetic] messages.
This is a video of crashing a

68
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:27,292
reporter from Fox news. If you
have to crash a reporter, the
Fox News guy. >> Smashed in an

69
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:43,920
'em bang. Off the road. As you
saw him, he kind of took his
hands off the wheel Charlie was

70
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:50,380
like don't do that. Then I
pressed the button. Wrecked. It
was awful. I was in the back ‑‑

71
00:09:50,380 --> 00:10:03,958
you guys can make . . . yeah, we
can. Okay. Show me. The camera
man was faced backwards in the

72
00:10:03,958 --> 00:10:12,278
passanger seat. Went home to his
wife and kids probably and gave
them a big hug. Did you guys

73
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:20,580
mean to do that? Yeah.
Apologize? Shit. Earlier we were
like put your seat belt on. He

74
00:10:20,583 --> 00:10:30,700
was like I can't get the shot.
Listen, not my fault. All this
comes down to as Charlie said

75
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:38,480
before. We think remote hacking
for control has at least three
parts. Remote attacks. Everyone

76
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:43,540
is kind of familiar with that.
Everyone is familiar with
wireless communication. Look at

77
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:49,620
the cars, figure out which to
buy and hack. We wanted to
figure out which of the three

78
00:10:49,625 --> 00:11:00,292
steps would be the easiest. We
can't go out and buy 30 cars and
bluetooth ‑‑ time, effort, money

79
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:08,380
we don't have all of it. What we
did, instead of actually doing
that we looked at the size

80
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:20,700
first. We were like the bigger,
the more bugs, better chance of
gaining remote access. Try code.

81
00:11:20,708 --> 00:11:26,708
More code, more chance. That is
the way we figure it. Do you
have a different opinion? Then .

82
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:39,720
. . >> Get out! >> Come back for
the last five minutes. >> Other
part is cyber physical: Computers take

83
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:46,740
messages that control physical
aspects. Adaptive cruise
control, car breaks if it sees a

84
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:53,000
car in front of it. City
driving, things like that. These
are ways that you almost can

85
00:11:53,000 --> 00:12:00,167
guarantee that you can send a
computer message. A lot of times
people used diagnostic messages.

86
00:12:00,167 --> 00:12:11,120
You may or may not be able to do
something. With cyberphysical
aspects, they are designed to ‑‑

87
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:17,920
>> We found, we did our research
on the Escape and Prius. The
Escape didn't have any ‑‑ we

88
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:29,480
were able to make the breaks lock
up and make them not work which
was exciting. On the Prius they

89
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:35,480
had a computer designed to send
messages on the cam bus for the
breaks. We had to do what they

90
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:47,375
do. It is a feature. When we
were trying to figure out of 30
cars which we want to buy ‑‑

91
00:12:47,375 --> 00:12:55,115
again we don't know whether the
breaks have a vulnerability we
want to engagement the most

92
00:12:55,120 --> 00:13:03,020
features are probably having the
most things you can control. We
wanted success with this. Don't

93
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:12,080
want to look like bigger losers
we already are. Remember the
battery ‑‑ >> Talk about

94
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:18,080
failure. >>Literally did not
watch it. It was too
embarrassing. >> The third piece

95
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:25,833
is network. A lot of this is
about. A lot of people,
especially the media were very

96
00:13:25,833 --> 00:13:32,125
keen on. Remember it is only
one‑third of the whole equation
we are talking about. Certain

97
00:13:32,125 --> 00:13:37,208
cars have certain features at
certain places. Not just this
flat network. They can be

98
00:13:37,208 --> 00:13:45,248
segregated. Certain cars may
provide challenges others don't.
With the second ‑‑ network. If

99
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:51,208
you attack, say, the radio and
you want to control, say, the
breaks, can you get messages

100
00:13:51,208 --> 00:13:56,125
from one to the other. Can
imagine a car designed that
there is no physical way to get

101
00:13:56,125 --> 00:14:00,083
messages from one to the other.
In which case you are safe. You
can attack my radio all you

102
00:14:00,083 --> 00:14:09,060
want, can't crash me, I am happy
with that. Other carses might
have on the same ECU ‑‑ could.

103
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:13,120
Right next to each other in the
network, nothing in the way to
stop you from going from one to

104
00:14:13,125 --> 00:14:19,250
the other. Searched all three of
them, combined them, tried to
figure out which cars we would

105
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:28,125
have the most success trying to
do this on. As a prelude to next
year's show. >> Exactly. >> We

106
00:14:28,125 --> 00:14:35,780
have those cars. >> We got the
cars we want. Now we have to ‑‑
>> Or never hear from us. Ride

107
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:43,333
off into the sunset and that
will be that. >> Features for
most people now are attack be

108
00:14:43,333 --> 00:14:50,773
surface [phonetic] these cars
are becoming more and more
complex and connected. That is

109
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:55,792
why this work is even more
intriguing. Super, super
complicated computers on four

110
00:14:55,792 --> 00:15:01,792
wheels that can brake
themselves. Cars are
complicated. It will be cool to

111
00:15:11,542 --> 00:15:20,742
hack them. There are too many
cars for any two, three, 40, 100
individuals to look at it.

112
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:28,833
Everyone needs to look at it as
we look at code on the Internet.
People look at cars and

113
00:15:28,833 --> 00:15:33,125
information, how to do it. By
now, I figure we have it
covered. For some reason no one

114
00:15:33,125 --> 00:15:39,583
did it. Probably because the
tools are crap. But what are you
going to do. Remote attack

115
00:15:39,583 --> 00:15:48,243
service ‑‑ this was awesome. >>
But dash there is a lot of
remote attack servers we only

116
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:58,100
cover a few. I am taking my
time. >> Go with that. >> So we
are going to go in all different

117
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:03,200
kinds of things you can imagine
attacking remotely, a 
vehicle. We are going to sort of

118
00:16:03,208 --> 00:16:09,208
go in increasing range. The
first one we have here is ‑‑
what is it called? Passes ‑‑

119
00:16:12,833 --> 00:16:22,533
what is it called? >> It starts
the car. >> On the left you see.
an instrument cluster. >> On the

120
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:26,740
right is a little thing that goes
around where your key goes in
There is a little

121
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:35,417
antenna in there. The data is
passed between it to make sure
only ‑‑ from an attack

122
00:16:35,417 --> 00:16:43,250
perspective, I don't care about
someone ‑‑ I care about can you
have a little radio station

123
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:49,667
sending radio waves that somehow
exploit a vulnerability in the
code, waiting for this

124
00:16:49,667 --> 00:16:57,042
information from the key? This
one does not seem that likely the
not much data a sent over radio.

125
00:16:57,042 --> 00:17:06,820
It is a couple of millimeters.
While it is an attack service,
probably not the best. Giant ass

126
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:10,940
antenna pointing at ‑‑ I think
it is obvious when you see a
giant antenna pointing to the

127
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:20,740
passenger seat. I wasn't plugged
in. That was remote. Right
there. You could hack it. But

128
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:26,740
probably not your first choice.
Next is the tire pressure
monitoring. All of the cars

129
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:35,625
today since I don't know when ‑‑
>> 2006. >> Thank you,
Mr. Egghead. Sensors in the tire

130
00:17:35,625 --> 00:17:43,705
communicate wirelessly with an
ten as that is processing that.
Hey, light comes on, you are

131
00:17:43,708 --> 00:17:55,080
getting a flat tire. In the
floor here is ‑‑ function box.
It has the antenna that receives

132
00:17:55,080 --> 00:18:01,040
the signal from the sensors.
Anyway the point is here you
have maybe a little more range,

133
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:07,540
meters. There is going to be no
complexity in the date that
passed. All going to be like ‑‑

134
00:18:07,542 --> 00:18:14,833
>> It is a number, right, the
PSI of your tire. >> Not much
more than that. >> But

135
00:18:14,833 --> 00:18:20,833
researchers have communicated
with cars. There is something
going on! . Something. So, there

136
00:18:27,333 --> 00:18:34,542
is code running. Means probably
there is stuff there. Still we
do not think it is the best

137
00:18:34,542 --> 00:18:44,622
candidate for remote entry into
a vehicle. But way better . . .
almost everyone here is familiar

138
00:18:44,625 --> 00:18:53,833
with the car clicker that can
start ‑‑ sometimes start the
engine in as well. These again,

139
00:18:53,833 --> 00:19:01,708
broader range, talking more than
a couple of meters now. Again, a
con of it is probably the not

140
00:19:01,708 --> 00:19:08,583
much data. Probably going to
challenge the response, set a
specific value to open or start

141
00:19:08,583 --> 00:19:15,500
the car. Not really too much
else. On the other hand it is
usually connect the to a lot of

142
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:20,667
cool parts, locking, unlocking
the door, the engine. Ends up in
a cool place in the car.

143
00:19:20,667 --> 00:19:29,042
Probably more concerned with
theft from reproducing these
than code execution as the car

144
00:19:29,042 --> 00:19:35,333
flies by to do brakes or
steering. Probably a more viable
option. They are going to lock

145
00:19:35,333 --> 00:19:41,333
down on these car manufacturers
because they care about that.
Hard reverse‑engineer. The

146
00:19:46,667 --> 00:19:54,625
others we will get to in a
second they probably don't care
about. >> Exactly. One of the

147
00:19:54,625 --> 00:20:03,860
more familiar wireless protocols
is bluetooth. We think this is
probably one of the most ripe

148
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:09,540
attack surfaces, right? Because
almost every car has it because
something for not using your

149
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:20,082
phone or demanding hands free. A
lot of times they support
streaming of audio and data. You

150
00:20:20,083 --> 00:20:26,500
can stream your music. It also
gets the ‑‑ I don't believe
there is a lot of code out there

151
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:32,667
that has not had a vulnerability
for audio parsing. For image
parsing. These are things people

152
00:20:32,667 --> 00:20:37,625
are familiar with. Especially
because they have been around a
while. They may be using old

153
00:20:37,625 --> 00:20:45,417
computer software with known
vulnerables. You have to get a
new bluetooth. We think this is

154
00:20:45,417 --> 00:20:51,417
one of the most viable attacks.
(Off microphone) Still
bluetooth, you have you to be

155
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:08,900
around 10‑meters, 30 minutes.
You have to be able to see the
car basically or be close

156
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:14,900
enough. There are some that you
don't have to be very close at
all. So, in your radio, you see

157
00:21:14,958 --> 00:21:25,458
the beautiful radio from my
cheap Ford Escape. It is
obviously getting FM signal or

158
00:21:25,458 --> 00:21:33,638
something with audio in it which
probably I can't imagine but
there is more data than that

159
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:39,640
coming 106.7. This is data that
is sent anything to the actual
you imagine people screwing

160
00:21:54,208 --> 00:22:09,875
up ‑‑ people tend to mess it up.
It is still pretty ‑‑ really,
the holy grail a lot for all of

161
00:22:09,875 --> 00:22:18,655
this is the gateway now for WiFi
cars as well. The range is
practically unlimited. If you

162
00:22:18,667 --> 00:22:23,750
are in range, you are in range.
They are designed to be used
everywhere. You want to hit an

163
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:29,750
SOS button or get this
connectivity. Or like Chris we
want to make dinner

164
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:43,100
reservations. I have the car,
SOS button. It has a concierge.
Yo, I want dinner reservations.

165
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:48,380
Sir is this an emergency. Yes I
want to make dinner
reservations. Hit the other

166
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:56,580
button. This is for an
emergency, people who are are
dying. Can you still take dinner

167
00:22:56,583 --> 00:23:10,243
reservations. Communicating data
across the world. >> This is
probably what most automobile

168
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:17,080
manufacturers worry about. The
use is pretty well understood.
Right and

169
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:28,542
The new thing I think that
becomes very concerning for us
is cars are now getting their

170
00:23:28,542 --> 00:23:35,250
own apps, getting web browser,
he we know we he can't write web
browsers or secure apps. I hope

171
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:43,900
to have a car with a web
browser. I know how to write
a web browser exploit. I don't

172
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:54,420
know anything about a Bluetooth
exploit. I can't write anything but
a browser exploit. This adds attacks

173
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:59,020
the security community is
already familiar with this. That
is why it ends up being pretty

174
00:23:59,042 --> 00:24:05,542
concerning. Imagine you brought
a device 2012 a piece of
hardware that had web browser on

175
00:24:05,542 --> 00:24:09,750
it, you couldn't update it.
Would you be worried? If there
is a problem it is really hear

176
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:20,600
to fix as well. Don't you
dare ‑‑ >> I am not. I have this
new Jeep that is cool. It can be

177
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:32,180
a WiFi hotspot. It provides
Internet to ‑‑ but I actually,
look here it has open services.

178
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:41,958
You can ‑‑ we are getting closer
to cars being more like software
which people like us ‑‑ most of

179
00:24:41,958 --> 00:24:49,638
us understand, hardware
problems. Bluetooth and radio
stuff is still . . . in the

180
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:58,660
game. Getting in the car,
services we have been doing
years and years. >> Something

181
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:11,240
wrong, doesn't work. Came
pre‑backdoor. >> Cyberphysical
as I explained before they

182
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:18,540
control these last attributes. I
am not the biggest fan of cyber
anything. Well,. >> Yeah, you

183
00:25:18,542 --> 00:25:27,958
are. >> Well, one.
Cyber‑specific site. The thing
is people in the government

184
00:25:27,958 --> 00:25:33,000
sector, in the private and in
the public sector use these
terms. If we are going to get

185
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:39,958
along, communicate and work with
each other, we have to agree on
a set of verbiage. It seems like

186
00:25:39,958 --> 00:25:50,538
if we want to communicate with
them ‑‑ in the talk I am going
to use device this is your car

187
00:25:50,542 --> 00:25:58,582
that can control things in your
car. Here is an example of a
thing in your car ‑‑ >> Yeah.

188
00:25:58,583 --> 00:26:05,125
Now we are going to go
through ‑‑ very 250. Sweet car
has all of these awesome

189
00:26:05,125 --> 00:26:11,125
features. >> These cars have.
Not many of us realize they have
(noises/beeps). >> As you see, I

190
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:33,000
am on a closed test track in
Pittsburgh. I am not ‑‑ >> I
thought that was a Hollywood

191
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:45,000
testing. >> You can have
controls that you don't to press
from our experience like that,

192
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:55,020
send messages, sensor, compute
values, sends messages, brakes
work ‑‑ don't work ‑‑ >> A

193
00:26:55,020 --> 00:27:05,320
sensor hooked up to the brakes.
The brakes engage. The computer
knows what the sensor values are

194
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:15,440
and communicates to the brakes.
How to do that. When to do that.
That means if you are on it, you

195
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:19,900
can be ‑‑ >> Exactly. (audio
lost for captioner. >> It means
that it has tock network

196
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:40,560
Yeah so even things simple
as headlamps connected to
the cars network. To turn the corner.

197
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:47,260
It provides better driving experience
and safety but at the same time
another piece of the automobile

198
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:54,880
onto the cars network. It needs
to know how to turn the lights.
Things that were complete

199
00:27:54,880 --> 00:28:10,220
separate are joined together.
>>It means the steering has
to be network accessible

200
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:21,600
can have. Because you can't
isolate those things you think
would be isolated. It may have a

201
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:30,020
gateway in between but still . .
. intelligent cruise control
(noise behind a voice saying

202
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:48,080
something once it sees the back
of the vehicle then the car
speeds back up again. >> The car

203
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,000
pulls it ‑‑ slows itself down,
speeds itself up. Can happen in
communication, sensors, wires.

204
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,960
Sending mess as to the car,
telling it to accelerate. That
might be something we can take

205
00:28:54,140 --> 00:29:00,140
advantage of (background noise

stand back (inaudible). >>

206

yourself. >> I did. There is one

207
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:34,680
old guy in the back nodding. >>
But, yeah, steering. It will be
a peace that is network

208
00:29:55,917 --> 00:30:00,375
accessible. These are useful
pieces; they keep drivers more
safe. >> There is a computer

209
00:30:00,375 --> 00:30:06,625
that can control the computer
while you are driving.
(background noise.) >> It is all

210
00:30:06,625 --> 00:30:13,333
of compared to this didn't have
sounds. You guys are getting
bonuses. >> Bonus. >> Collision

00:30:13,333 --> 00:30:20,042
prevention I am not going to
touch brake. Hear the beeping?
>> The brake, automatically, in

212
00:30:20,042 --> 00:30:26,292
that instance ‑‑ I guess the
radar knew it was cardboarded,
not a public transit vehicle.

213
00:30:26,292 --> 00:30:33,417
It's the same shot. >> No,
different angle. This is why our
hacking is (car sound in

214
00:30:33,417 --> 00:30:39,292
background) imagine what they
thought about this psychopath?
Drive it through 'em? Anyway it

215
00:30:39,292 --> 00:30:46,833
was a lot of fun. Way more
fun ‑‑ >> Testing is better than
connecting to the bug. >>

216
00:30:46,833 --> 00:30:53,875
Actually wanted to really crash,
thought it was going to stop one
of the boxes smashed underneath

217
00:30:53,875 --> 00:30:57,083
my car. >> Then. (Multiple
voices). >> A lot of the
coverage was really on the

218
00:30:57,083 --> 00:31:03,083
network architecture view. We
wanted to look at these three
separate piece toss a remote

219
00:32:14,333 --> 00:32:20,333
attack and look at cars and
decide if we were to get one,
which would we get which would

220
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:33,417
be most successful. We used the
term "hack ability" we used that
because it is less difficult

221
00:32:33,417 --> 00:32:39,417
than explaining it every time as
well. >> We can'ted a car that
would present the least possible

222
00:32:44,042 --> 00:32:48,958
problems to a remote attacker.
>> Exactly. Our thought was you
can buy a consumer reports

223
00:32:48,958 --> 00:32:54,958
magazine it will tell you the
cars with best safety features
and ratings. I think we should

224
00:32:58,208 --> 00:33:04,000
start doing it for cyber
security of vehicles. We want to
know what kind of security we

225
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:11,833
think these things have when we
buy them, so you can be an
informed consumer. My paper, if

226
00:33:11,833 --> 00:33:16,000
you really want to read it,
there is a lot of good stuff in
there. >> We have presented so

227
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:21,125
far about ten pages. We will do
the rest in the next four
minutes. >> Getting the

228
00:33:21,125 --> 00:33:27,125
information was hard a. Every
manufacturer is different. Go to
the mechanic's site. The wiring

229
00:33:30,833 --> 00:33:38,542
diagrams are different. We try
to correlate everything. It took
a long time. >> The reason we

230
00:33:38,542 --> 00:33:46,458
get the diagrams, go to the
mechanics' sites, the first
time, we downloading ‑‑ didn't

231
00:33:46,458 --> 00:33:53,250
try to hack it. No instructions
on how it is done. The sec time
we looked at the wiring

232
00:33:53,250 --> 00:33:59,250
diagrams. >> And decided we
should have used them long ago.
Hackers don't want to read

233
00:34:01,958 --> 00:34:07,958
instructions. You buy a new
table and for the next ten days
figure out how it is assembled.

234
00:34:12,333 --> 00:34:19,458
>> Hackers. Read the
instructions. Didn't actually do
the hack. >> The Internet is

235
00:34:19,458 --> 00:34:27,250
hard. Let's go shopping. A lot
of the websites ‑‑ >> Let's do
it now. The websites just

236
00:34:27,250 --> 00:34:33,375
weren't very useful. >> The
forums. >> I am trying to be
nice. >> You search things like

237
00:34:33,375 --> 00:34:40,958
cam. Nothing. I know you have a
cam bus. I have used it. If you
are not logged in, you don't get

238
00:34:40,958 --> 00:34:46,250
search results. If you are, you
get different once. This
constantly only works Tuesdays

239
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:51,167
and Wednesdays and bank
holidays. >> Looks like they are
working perfectly. Suck. Load up

240
00:34:51,167 --> 00:34:57,167
IE 6. Don't tell you to use a
different browser. I can't find
this. Dude, IE 7. You have to

241
00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:06,750
look at it. I am sure all of the
computers ‑‑ to hell and back
be. >> Huge collaboration

242
00:35:10,917 --> 00:35:16,917
between the NFA and automotive
manufacturers. >> Exactly. >> It
took time. I don't want to

243
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:27,000
say ‑‑ this is the boring part,
remote survey. We tried to make
it easy. If you get the paper

244
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:33,000
you will get these icons. These
things are kind of important
pieces, the pieces bee he want

245
00:35:36,667 --> 00:35:42,667
to research and are concerned
with. All of the ‑‑ cyber
physical things. Put them on the

246
00:35:45,833 --> 00:35:52,708
diagram. We are going to fly
through the diagrams. There is
not much to say. You want to

247
00:35:52,708 --> 00:35:58,750
read the paper, look at them.
Note there is a bunch of
different arc about tech tours.

248
00:35:58,750 --> 00:36:05,125
I thought most of the cars would
be ‑‑ had all of the Internet
stuff somewhere then the

249
00:36:05,125 --> 00:36:11,000
important other stuff somewhere,
other stuff other places,
connected by a gateway. That is

250
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:18,500
how they are set up. Obviously,
this is not the case. You have a
new Accord, for example, or

251
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:28,120
audionav unit connected to both
cam buses. Things like that are
problematic for us. If you hack

252
00:36:28,125 --> 00:36:35,375
bluetooth you are on a device
not only on your power train bus
but on your secondary cam bus as

253
00:36:35,375 --> 00:36:41,375
well. >> The last two cars is
way easy, presents less
obstacles. In the three steps

254
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:53,140
there is no step two. >> Remote,
figure out how to make the
brakes. >> Exactly. You have

255
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:59,958
almost everything on one cam
bus gateway that communicates
with braking and steering.

256
00:36:59,958 --> 00:37:06,375
Having stuff on one bus
especially that contains the
wireless connectivity features

257
00:37:06,375 --> 00:37:15,995
is something that we probably
think can be used to easily
achieve hacking into the car. >>

258
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:21,340
Because there happens to be a
gatewar between the radio and
brakes does not mean you can't

259
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:32,240
send messages it will make it
harder. The academics were able
to go from a part of the car's

260
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:38,125
network to wherever the brakes
and stuff were by reprogramming
the gateway. It is possible you

261
00:37:38,125 --> 00:37:43,750
can get by the gateways. >> They
are not stopping everything. We
have to look at it. >> Something

262
00:37:43,750 --> 00:37:55,300
else you have to look like. In
the Escape there are two
networks, one where the TPMS

263
00:37:55,300 --> 00:38:01,300
and the brakes [phonetic]. On
not sure how to get from the
PPMS to the brakes. Hard to

264
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:13,740
hell. Cars went through
evolution. Here is a 2010 and
2006. Each car taking the place

265
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:20,320
of the other. Went from the flat
pan networks to a more segmented
one they added more features and

266
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:27,375
functionality. People say I am
going to go buy that. >> I buy
the new car. Has all of the

267
00:38:27,375 --> 00:38:37,175
safety features of those things
are going to safe your ass more
than be . . . >> That thing

268
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:45,160
stops itself. I can drive and
tweet all the time. All day. >>
Why wouldn't you. >> Drive and

269
00:38:45,167 --> 00:38:54,917
tweet. Get a latte. Don't know
if we have time to do this. This
carry ended up getting most

270
00:38:54,917 --> 00:39:01,777
hackable. There are two
different cam buses, all a of
the interesting things are

271
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:08,680
cam C. But there is the radio
which has almost all of the
wireless stuff. I lives on both

272
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:14,080
of those networks. Essentially
it does not look like a flat
network. But it is completely

273
00:39:14,083 --> 00:39:21,667
flat. Everything you care about.
While the Dodge is the same way
it does not have cyber specific

274
00:39:21,667 --> 00:39:28,292
things even though the network
architecture is the same. The
car is made by the same parent

275
00:39:28,292 --> 00:39:34,000
company but network line is
different. The big difference is
the radio is only on the

276
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:41,208
privileged network not the one
that has the brakes. Even though
you think they are both the same

277
00:39:41,208 --> 00:39:48,125
parent company they would be the
exactly the same douse not end
up the same. It is the same as

278
00:39:48,125 --> 00:39:53,605
300, less cyber specific
features. Goes fast. >> I wanted
that to be the most hackable to

279
00:39:53,605 --> 00:40:03,912
justify buying it. >> SC
[phonetic] segmented cam but
interesting stuff connected to

280
00:40:03,917 --> 00:40:13,657
both. Old Ford Fusion not much
in it. New one, a lot in it.
These things go through an

281
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:24,380
evolution. BMW as well. >> The
cars most applicable have the
most features. >> That does not

282
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:30,000
mean that we want cars with less
features. We want cars with all
sorts of radical features. But

283
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:39,020
design ‑‑ exactly. You can see
BMW similar throughout. Most
cars except the concept car is

284
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:48,620
crazy. >> Even that is
segmented. >> Yes. Range Rover
very segmented. Has not changed

285
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:55,333
all that much in the evolution
of their vehicles where you just
have ‑‑ ended up using

286
00:40:55,333 --> 00:41:04,573
technology, still enjoy it, have
suppliers that use it. It
happens a lot. Sometimes they

287
00:41:04,580 --> 00:41:12,440
don't change at all a. 2014
Prius basically identical to the
2010. At one point you had this

288
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:18,458
massive shift in architecture.
Again more features more
complexity. They re‑architect

289
00:41:18,458 --> 00:41:25,518
how these things are done. We
have been told to eliminate all
of our chatter ‑‑ >> Right. What

290
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:30,780
about the Presidents car. What 
about gangster rappers. What
cars do they drive?

291
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:42,540
about . . . range Rovers. >>
Bentleys. All of the cars we did
not look at. More completion.

292
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:46,860
Manufacturers have different
designs for different cars. We
have been saying for almost two

293
00:41:46,860 --> 00:41:51,340
years: Almost every car had
something different about it. >>
Right. >> This is the thing that

294
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:58,700
made hacking a car hard. Even if
you know everything about a car
it does not generalize to other

295
00:41:58,708 --> 00:42:03,868
cars. Which is why we do this
talk. Last year, we knew
everything about two cars but

296
00:42:03,868 --> 00:42:08,268
nothing about other cars next
we'll give a talk where we know
a little about all the cars but

297
00:42:08,268 --> 00:42:15,480
not much about each of them.
>> One of the biggest things 
we thought Holy shit, patching

298
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:23,780
is a huge disaster. We get a 
Windows update or Mac patch or
update, it is easy, almost

299
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:29,620
automatic. Right now you with a
problem in the car they send you
a letter, tell you to go to a

300
00:42:29,625 --> 00:42:36,105
mechanic shop to get the car
fixed. What happens when you
sell the car? Right now there is

301
00:42:36,105 --> 00:42:44,417
this huge issue with patching.
If something comes out, there is
no good way to fix it. >> When I

302
00:42:44,417 --> 00:42:49,517
get a recall notice ‑‑ I rip it
up. >> I still get recall
notices for the Prius and Ford

303
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:57,440
Escape. >> Those cars are
fine. >> Those cars are fine.
They are dead. Securing an

304
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:05,300
automobile is important to us.
End points. People are doing
right now. Maybe you could

305
00:43:06,060 --> 00:43:11,580
segment cam message injection.
The thing with the bluetooth
does that have to write messages

306
00:43:11,583 --> 00:43:19,458
on the bus? Probably not. I am
not an automotive architect.
But, you know ‑‑ >> We can tell

307
00:43:19,458 --> 00:43:25,417
manufacturers to focus on
stopping the remote attacks.
That is one of the three steps.

308
00:43:25,420 --> 00:43:32,167
We want to make all three steps
difficult like lessons learned >> It
is kind of turning back a clock.

309
00:43:32,167 --> 00:43:40,458
The same a steps we went through
in the late '90's and early '00s
same things happen in cars.

310
00:43:40,458 --> 00:43:47,583
Crypto not going to work. >>
Feel sorry the people who are
leaving. They are going to start

311
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:55,125
crying if they don't see this.
>> From our perspective, adds a
layer of complexity for hackers.

312
00:43:58,060 --> 00:44:04,160
What didn't we talk about? That
is used almost ridiculously in
everyone's environment is

313
00:44:04,167 --> 00:44:13,667
prevention. This is the
hackolator 3000. We came up with
these algorithms. >> I did actually >>

314
00:44:13,667 --> 00:44:21,792
I architected it. >> You were
there. >> I was present. So
that's something. Basically,

315
00:44:21,792 --> 00:44:28,412
press a button, learn how the
car works. If anything is ‑‑
stadard movement. We saw how

316
00:44:28,420 --> 00:44:35,600
attacks work. No way to
objfuscate them. The networks
are simple. Then stop the

317
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:44,500
attack. We have in thing here.
>> Car networks are different
from Internet. The main thing.

318
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:50,500
Network is completely
predictable on computers. Things
like attacks stand out. Go!

319
00:44:50,540 --> 00:44:56,320
(Video) (Multiple voices inaudible)

320
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:56,440
Only took few seconds to learn how
the car works. If there is an attack
disabling the brakes, you can

321
00:45:56,440 --> 00:46:05,040
stop it before it is happening.
We opted to short the cam bus out.
Nothing would work but I am sure

322
00:46:05,042 --> 00:46:11,792
you can do something else. >>
Like anything is anomalous, all
of the attacks we know ‑‑ >> You

323
00:46:11,792 --> 00:46:20,833
can plug this into any car. As
long as you can get a nice
sample ‑‑ >> That is it. Thanks.

324
00:46:20,833 --> 00:46:29,973
Wait. There is one more thing.
Oh, I fooled ya. >> Suckers! >>
So we are going to have some

325
00:46:29,980 --> 00:46:45,740
bugs dropped now. Two methods to
jailbreak Jeep, Dodge SRT. >> That
is a model skateboard. >> Here

326
00:46:45,740 --> 00:46:54,280
is how you can jail‑break your
car. The way that updates work
is ‑‑ for these vehicles is get

327
00:46:54,280 --> 00:47:03,960
a USB stick, download ISO file
stick it in the car. The car sees
the USB stick with the ISO file

328
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:11,960
It checks it and if that's 
cool it updates your file. So I
had an idea: I will wait until

329
00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:25,375
it checks for ‑‑ runs through
and verifies. Then I will switch
out the USB switch see if that

330
00:47:25,375 --> 00:47:34,355
works. It is cool, says it
installed it. Ungh. Did not
work. The stick. Says it is

331
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:41,500
not ‑‑ you are not going to
change up on me. They thought
about it. Well done, Chrysler.

332
00:47:42,940 --> 00:47:51,792
They didn't think about this I
go further. Say yes, I would
like to install this software.

333
00:47:51,792 --> 00:47:58,732
So it starts to do its thing.
I look at my hand in a second
because I am ready

334
00:47:58,740 --> 00:48:04,292
(noise in background. The noise
you are camping. >> That is the
Bronx. >> As soon as it

335
00:48:04,292 --> 00:48:14,012
restarts, I pull the stick, now
the car is in a bit of a pickle.
>> [Laughter] >> It has

336
00:48:14,020 --> 00:48:21,400
written values saying it needs
to restart in like, upgrade mode.
But it doesn't have anything to

337
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:27,820
upgrade from so  what it is
going to do now instead of fully
rejecting me, in a moment it is

338
00:48:27,820 --> 00:48:32,833
going to beg me for ‑‑ >> You
are going to put the same one
that was in there? >> No ‑‑ fair

339
00:48:32,833 --> 00:48:40,375
enough ‑‑ I am going to stick
the stick in there. Now it is
going to check. The code that

340
00:48:40,375 --> 00:48:47,708
does the check is from the USB
stick. I am going to leave off
that part. >> Can you

341
00:48:47,708 --> 00:48:57,140
fast‑forward here a bit. It says
insert USB stick. >> So bad. >>
Anyway, you can fast‑forward to

342
00:48:57,140 --> 00:49:03,020
the end ‑‑ you will see that ‑‑
never mind. You ruined it. Jail
break method two, the preferred

343
00:49:03,020 --> 00:49:12,040
method for hackers. Take the
upgrade file, reverse it. There
are some ‑‑ in there. In charm

344
00:49:12,042 --> 00:49:21,831
of the check. There is an
awesome code snippet there. It
opens the file, reads 128 bites

345
00:49:21,833 --> 00:49:34,933
into the file, reads one byte.
If it is a capital F ‑‑ be if it
is ‑‑ awesome data. Skip. I am

346
00:49:34,940 --> 00:49:44,540
a good reverse‑engineer. Yeah.
>> I think most people can do
that ‑‑ >> I found it! Found it.

347
00:49:44,540 --> 00:49:51,300
Entered capital a letter F and
although and behold it totally
works. Then I can do things ‑‑

348
00:49:51,300 --> 00:49:59,958
it already has SSH on it. Put
that on, enter my password. >>
What would you do? Also.

349
00:49:59,958 --> 00:50:13,875
(Applause) >> If I had my car, I
would do this what would you all
do? >> When you start your car .

350
00:50:13,875 --> 00:50:13,875
. . (sound of car starting). >>
Thanks a lot. (Applause)
