1
00:00:00,208 --> 00:00:06,792
>> Thanks. Hi everyone. May name
is Elie and today we are going
to talk to you about new game

2
00:00:06,792 --> 00:00:12,792
hearthstone. This is a
(inaudible) work and does not
present our way point of view.

3
00:00:18,083 --> 00:00:22,500
If you are looking for a new job
we are hiring so if you are
interested come talk to me after

4
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:28,500
the talk. With that out of the
way, let's get started.
Hearthstone is a digital

5
00:00:33,167 --> 00:00:39,167
collectible card game developed
earlier this year. It is based
on War of Warcraft and

6
00:00:43,792 --> 00:00:50,708
(inaudible). Everything is too
interesting sometimes and
consequences that happens. For

7
00:00:50,708 --> 00:00:55,750
us, at some point during the
last few months we started to be
more and more interested in how

8
00:00:55,750 --> 00:01:00,333
the game is structured, how we
can understand better
(inaudible) rather than playing

9
00:01:00,333 --> 00:01:04,542
it (inaudible). I remember June
I think I played only up to
Level 5 and probably like 100

10
00:01:04,542 --> 00:01:10,542
(inaudible). Which is a huge
down from I use to play. If you
haven't tried it you should. It

11
00:01:17,917 --> 00:01:23,917
is available on your computer,
Mac and PS and on Mobile
edition. Looking at this it's

12
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:36,083
also was a very good excuse for
me because I finally talked my
wife to come on stage with me.

13
00:01:36,083 --> 00:01:42,083
That's something I want for a
long time. So please be nice to
her. (Applause) So what are we

14
00:01:49,208 --> 00:01:55,208
talking about today? We're going
to talk about game complexity.
How to have about 500 cards now

15
00:01:57,667 --> 00:02:05,583
and (inaudible). The question
is, can we use (inaudible) can
we find things which makes us

16
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:12,708
given an edge. That's what this
talk is about. We wrote about
our research in Blizzard. I know

17
00:02:12,708 --> 00:02:16,458
some of them are in this room
but we didn't get any response
so I think they're fine with it.

18
00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:27,708
So while we wanted to talk to
you. First thing we want to tell
you about how to find

19
00:02:27,708 --> 00:02:31,958
undervalued cards. So each card
has a value and the question is,
are they better bang for the

20
00:02:31,958 --> 00:02:36,958
buck than others. The second
thing we wanted to tell you and
the thing we really keep under

21
00:02:36,958 --> 00:02:44,250
wraps and the surprise is Def
Con is can you predict what
you're going to play? Yes it's

22
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:50,458
possible. We're going show you
how. We also wanted to tell you
about how to predict the game

23
00:02:50,458 --> 00:02:56,083
outcome. It's interesting.
Except we don't have time.
45 minutes is too short. So

24
00:02:56,083 --> 00:03:03,958
we'll write about it. Of course
we wanted to tell you about the
alien invasion. No, wait. Not

25
00:03:03,958 --> 00:03:09,958
this one. How many of you play
can you please raise your hands.
How many of you reach legend? No

26
00:03:12,958 --> 00:03:18,958
one. Sorry. Legend for those
(inaudible) what a normal game
looks like. It is a board game.

27
00:03:22,125 --> 00:03:28,125
Turn by turn. Two player. Each
person is represented as a hero
which is inspired by world of

28
00:03:31,708 --> 00:03:38,792
Warcraft characters. You are at
the bottom. Here I'm playing the
(inaudible) hero and (inaudible)

29
00:03:38,792 --> 00:03:44,792
which is a solo player only
hero. The game ends when one of
the two heroes reach zero.

30
00:03:48,083 --> 00:03:54,083
(Inaudible) it is on the right
side of it. You use decks. And
cards for each limit is a limit.

31
00:03:59,792 --> 00:04:05,792
You can use only 30. Not 29 or
31. Just 30. Each card has to
show (inaudible). So every turn

32
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:14,167
you draw a card and the card
goes into your hand. This is my
hand. And you can see one of the

33
00:04:14,167 --> 00:04:19,875
cards highlighted in green. It
means I have to ask mana to
play. The mana is the resource

34
00:04:19,875 --> 00:04:24,875
we use to play cards. You also
have a ‑‑ your friend also has a
hand. You only see the back of

35
00:04:24,875 --> 00:04:30,875
it. Those who are curious know
they do not know the card ahead
of time. So (inaudible) on the

36
00:04:34,667 --> 00:04:40,667
right side you go from one of
the first turn as to turn ten.
After turn ten it should

37
00:04:46,417 --> 00:04:51,125
replenish but do not increase.
So the maximum amount of mana
you can have at the given time

38
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:57,125
is ten. So card can be a weapon
(inaudible) which you play
immediately. It can also be

39
00:05:00,542 --> 00:05:07,125
minions or creatures. You can
have up to seven on the Board
for each player. You open it at

40
00:05:07,125 --> 00:05:10,667
the top. Here you can see for
instance I am playing
(inaudible) and my opponent has

41
00:05:10,667 --> 00:05:16,792
three minion. So you see what
hearthstone looks like when you
play it. It's obviously designed

42
00:05:16,792 --> 00:05:22,792
to play on a tablet. Because we
designed like this. And they
simplify the law compared to

43
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:33,500
magic because you don't have to
deal with land. It's very simple
and very easy for people to get

44
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:39,500
in and get their first card
which is how they make money.
(Inaudible). Here is a quick

45
00:05:43,833 --> 00:05:49,833
video of me playing hearthstone
just to show you the game. You
can see this is my turn. Bring a

46
00:05:52,042 --> 00:05:57,750
new card into game. I draw a
game which goes to my hand. I
play another card and I take

47
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:05,500
another turn. Then my opponent
has a secret (inaudible) turn.
This is what a turn looks like.

48
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:10,125
On the video it is awesome
because the guy plays me fast.
You have up to 90 seconds so

49
00:06:10,125 --> 00:06:16,125
sometimes you have to wait and
drink coffee. So some people
play two games at once. What

50
00:06:18,792 --> 00:06:24,542
makes the game so interesting?
Everything is a card. If you
look at all the game structure

51
00:06:24,542 --> 00:06:30,625
the hero is a card. Everything
is a card. The card is the thing
we're going to look at in depth.

52
00:06:30,625 --> 00:06:36,625
So a card has a minion.
(Inaudible). The first one is a
mana. You play the card from

53
00:06:39,792 --> 00:06:45,792
zero to ten. And then you have
basic attributes in this card
which is (inaudible). Four here.

54
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:54,792
So that's a card and this is a
very boring card. Nothing
special about this card. What

55
00:06:54,792 --> 00:07:00,417
makes the game fun is there a
lot of card which have a lot of
interesting effects. Three of my

56
00:07:00,417 --> 00:07:06,417
favorite cards. (Inaudible).
What's very interesting is you
can play as intended or very

57
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:16,625
special combo and that's
basically how you win the game.
So one of the fun aspects of the

58
00:07:16,625 --> 00:07:22,708
game. Now that we know cards the
question is, is there a better
card or card which are better

59
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:29,958
bang for the bucks than others?
How do we find those? I know
it's early in the morning and

60
00:07:29,958 --> 00:07:35,500
the head hurts but bar with me
please. We're going to start
with the basic assumption of how

61
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:40,083
we're going to (inaudible) them.
The first thing is the mana card
is professional to the

62
00:07:40,083 --> 00:07:46,083
(inaudible). Which mean if you
play one card it's less powerful
than a three mana card. If you

63
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:56,500
had them everyone would play the
most powerful and overrun
people. It is a bit unbalanced

64
00:07:58,625 --> 00:08:04,625
but not so much. Two is the
power of the card roughly
increase which means a two mana

65
00:08:06,708 --> 00:08:12,708
card is twice as (inaudible) as
one. (Inaudible). It was means
the highest card was (inaudible)

66
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:24,500
and would have no chance of
success. (Indiscernible). Card
effects have a constant. It

67
00:08:31,958 --> 00:08:37,958
means given (inaudible) or any
effect have the same price
regardless of the card. There is

68
00:08:48,125 --> 00:08:54,542
no secret. All of this is a
card. Which brings us to the
fourth one which is having a

69
00:08:54,542 --> 00:09:00,292
card has value. Remember you
only get one card each turn. So
even holding a card has some

70
00:09:00,292 --> 00:09:06,375
value which, of course, is
interesting value of the card.
Finally, we believe there is no

71
00:09:06,375 --> 00:09:12,375
secret. We believe it has no
hidden factor and what you have
in the card is exactly what the

72
00:09:15,333 --> 00:09:20,917
value of the card should be. So
if we were (inaudible) you would
get the value of the card. The

73
00:09:20,917 --> 00:09:24,792
question is how you sum them is
another question we're going to
explore but there is nothing

74
00:09:24,792 --> 00:09:32,458
secret bit and you can actually
look at it. That's where we
start. As I said the mana is a

75
00:09:32,458 --> 00:09:40,417
price and price is equal to the
(inaudible) and the value. There
is nothing else on the card so

76
00:09:40,417 --> 00:09:48,125
we the exact price of mana is
exactly the sum of those
attributes. You put it into a

77
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:54,125
(inaudible) function. You say
for attack which is A is the
attack position which is the

78
00:09:57,417 --> 00:10:03,500
base point. How much mana cards
have one attack. Plus five
(inaudible) where etch is the

79
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:10,417
question. Which is the base
point. How much one count in
mana plus I which is interesting

80
00:10:10,417 --> 00:10:16,417
value of the card which is how
much mana does it cost to even
hold the card. With that you can

81
00:10:22,167 --> 00:10:29,792
without looking at it you can
compare it to (inaudible). Very
common card is the (inaudible).

82
00:10:29,792 --> 00:10:36,875
We can also put in a question.
Interesting value. We want to
convert it to our (inaudible).

83
00:10:36,875 --> 00:10:41,917
So same thing. We're going to be
very, very high‑tech. We're
going to go back and forth and

84
00:10:41,917 --> 00:10:48,750
we're going to just divide by
six. Yes that's really hard I
know. (Laughter) Then give you

85
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:55,208
one mana point. So for one mana
point you get one attack. One to
16 counts and interesting value

86
00:10:55,208 --> 00:11:01,792
of the card. On the other hand,
we're going to divide by four.
By doing this you say one point

87
00:11:01,792 --> 00:11:08,375
what you get is one attack and
1.25 (inaudible) for interesting
value. Here you can image as we

88
00:11:08,375 --> 00:11:14,375
see one of them gets better bang
for the bucks. Gets more points
than the (inaudible). And that's

89
00:11:17,833 --> 00:11:22,750
the kind of imbalance we're
going to look for. Let me give
you a more interesting example.

90
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:28,958
Fire ball. My most hated card.
It's very simple thing. For
those who don't know what a fire

91
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:34,958
ball is it is a big ball of fire
that can pulverize you and you
die. So, basically, this one is

92
00:11:37,583 --> 00:11:43,583
very simple. You pay four mana
and you blast the guy. So very
simple. One mana is 1.5. All

93
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:54,417
right. We already know fire ball
is great. How about we make a
giant fire ball. It's called a

94
00:11:54,417 --> 00:12:00,917
(inaudible). Bigger. Stronger.
Meaner. The fire blast is
basically ten mana. For ten mana

95
00:12:00,917 --> 00:12:08,875
you get ten damage. Well okay.
But then might be bigger but the
bang for ‑‑ the value is not

96
00:12:08,875 --> 00:12:14,875
that great. You get one mana,
one damage. If you have ten mana
you can play two fire

97
00:12:18,208 --> 00:12:26,083
ball‑and‑a‑half for the price of
one. So the value of the fire
blast is less interesting than

98
00:12:26,083 --> 00:12:31,792
the fireball. What's interesting
is this is a new version of the
fire ball. Earlier in the year,

99
00:12:31,792 --> 00:12:38,250
we had a premier version which
use to cost eight mana. Where at
that time the mana cost was even

100
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:44,250
lower than the fireball. Where
basically for the adjusted value
we get 1.25 damage for one mana.

101
00:12:46,417 --> 00:12:53,167
So something is not right here,
right. Let's compare the two. If
you take ten damage you think

102
00:12:53,167 --> 00:12:59,500
the fireball should do four
damage not six. And you're,
like, well okay but the fireball

103
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:04,875
is properly priced. You should
do six damage for four. Well in
this case a power blast should

104
00:13:04,875 --> 00:13:11,833
be (inaudible) damage not ten.
Give me back my fire blast. Even
if you look at the (inaudible)

105
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:17,833
you can see there are some
decisions which are ‑‑ of course
we don't have all the

106
00:13:20,375 --> 00:13:26,375
(inaudible) and this is based on
tactical secret analysis.
Complexity is the basic whole

107
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:36,250
idea of finding the value card.
How do we count that to hundreds
of cards. We're able to do 130

108
00:13:39,625 --> 00:13:47,083
cards because attribute is a bit
complicated so you have to cross
deck. A bunch of decks you have

109
00:13:47,083 --> 00:13:53,083
to process. We did 130. How we
do that. We model the card as we
did before. Then we use those

110
00:14:00,042 --> 00:14:06,042
cards and reverse (inaudible)
using linear algebra. Don't
worry it's not as bad as it

111
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:15,167
sounds. And use (inaudible) for
the real value. The last step is
where you say here is my real

112
00:14:15,167 --> 00:14:23,083
value. Here is my face value:
You get a negative and you find
another value card. That's as

113
00:14:23,083 --> 00:14:29,083
simple as this. Not that bad. So
let me show you on a very simple
card how it looks like. Then

114
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:39,500
when we that I will show you.
Let's take three cards which
have charge. Charge is you put

115
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:45,375
the card and the cards can
attack as soon as it come into
play. We have four. We have the

116
00:14:45,375 --> 00:14:52,583
(inaudible) and the commander.
We're going to show two more
cards which have different

117
00:14:52,583 --> 00:14:59,250
shares. The reason why they the
commander is the middle is
because it has both attributes.

118
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:03,125
One of the ideas of having
linear algebra you can commute
coefficient. That's why we can

119
00:15:03,125 --> 00:15:09,833
convert cards because it is very
complicated. So we do as we did
today. We put them into an

120
00:15:09,833 --> 00:15:15,833
equation. So we have four
attacks. We have a charge
partition which is ‑‑ partition

121
00:15:23,375 --> 00:15:29,375
plus the intrinsic value of the
card. Then we're going to
reverse the attribute partition.

122
00:15:34,375 --> 00:15:39,417
To do that we put them into a
matrix which is basically a
table. And we put them like

123
00:15:39,417 --> 00:15:46,167
this. You say well performer
gets four attacks, three counts,
one charge, zero shield and one

124
00:15:46,167 --> 00:15:50,750
(inaudible). Then I do the same
for the rocket EER. Here you can
see it has one and one. Then you

125
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:56,750
add the two other cards which
has (inaudible). Then you have
one line of (inaudible) which is

126
00:16:03,417 --> 00:16:09,417
the lead square and boom you get
partition. And the partition are
one attack, the A, minus one for

127
00:16:18,042 --> 00:16:23,833
(inaudible), two for charge, and
one for (inaudible). Dude that
doesn't make any sense. Yes you

128
00:16:23,833 --> 00:16:30,292
are right. It is because you
only have five cards. Five cards
is not a good partition because

129
00:16:30,292 --> 00:16:36,292
there is too much instability.
So now how do you find the real
price? Well now we're going to

130
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:47,375
be back to kindergarten where
you learn how to add stuff.
Basically what you do is you say

131
00:16:50,292 --> 00:16:56,292
it's four times one plus two
times minus one plus one plus
one. And the price is six. So

132
00:16:59,208 --> 00:17:03,958
the real value according to our
computation is six. The card is
fair. There's nothing different

133
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:09,958
between the face value and the
real value so you are, like, not
interested. Let's try again.

134
00:17:18,125 --> 00:17:23,500
It's game. A lot of people said
the formula isn't the value. Let
me ‑‑ let's try again. So it's

135
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:28,167
one attack, one count, one
(inaudible), one shield plus the
value of the card. So it's one

136
00:17:28,167 --> 00:17:33,417
times one, plus one times one
minus one plus one. Now it's
two. Wait. Two? No. The card is

137
00:17:33,417 --> 00:17:38,958
one right? You are right. That
is why it is an undervalued card
and should cost twice. Even with

138
00:17:38,958 --> 00:17:44,750
our partitions you can always
see this card is clearly
undervalued. That's basically

139
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:50,750
the idea we have is it always
works. So I did post that online
and we got a lot of good

140
00:17:53,292 --> 00:18:00,375
feedback about it. A lot of good
comments. Thank you anyone who
pointed out. The most important

141
00:18:00,375 --> 00:18:05,208
one was, hey dude you should
take into card dependency.
That's actually true. Thanks to

142
00:18:05,208 --> 00:18:11,875
you. The charge would be
basically a factor of the
attack. And mode of the attack.

143
00:18:11,875 --> 00:18:18,875
So now we now use attack time
and charge. Same thing for wind
free. Now we know it's to the

144
00:18:18,875 --> 00:18:25,292
attack of the card. One where we
have a large feedback. The
question is about shield should

145
00:18:25,292 --> 00:18:31,375
be. It is a coefficient and
related to half. Related to
attack. Difficult. If you have

146
00:18:31,375 --> 00:18:37,500
idea, let me know. The thing is
up. So that's a comment from
someone on the blog which

147
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:42,250
actually wrote me a long post.
Actually cards have a budget.
And the budget is two times the

148
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:50,083
mana plus one. I have no idea
how we come up with the idea. It
is absolutely reasonable and

149
00:18:50,083 --> 00:18:54,458
when you do it the partitions
look way better, it is true. I
just didn't know how this guy

150
00:18:54,458 --> 00:19:02,250
get it. But thanks. So after
writing code and de‑bugging and
de‑bugging and de‑bugging you

151
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:08,667
have something and voila. You
get your coefficients. So these
are the coefficients. You can

152
00:19:08,667 --> 00:19:14,667
see the most valued coefficient
is ‑‑ I'm sorry. I must mention
because we use a budget idea

153
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:23,708
that I've been proposed now two
partition points is roughly one
mana point. Basically you are

154
00:19:23,708 --> 00:19:29,708
trying a minion got you five to
add to the card. The damage cost
you 1.5 mana per point. Joint

155
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:39,875
card ‑‑ a single card cost you
roughly 1.5 mana. Then the
shield is pretty expensive one

156
00:19:39,875 --> 00:19:46,417
mana. We also have negative
coefficient which is basically
decrease the price of the card

157
00:19:46,417 --> 00:19:52,750
as you expect. Having your joint
card is the highest one followed
by these cards discard. And then

158
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:58,750
we have overload which is
(inaudible) you pay another
price. All this is perfectly

159
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:07,000
fine. We're really happy. We
have this guy. We did something
which was very clever which was

160
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:17,208
the single target and multiple
target the coefficient is
different. I am going to show

161
00:20:17,208 --> 00:20:23,208
you why. Keep in mind that we
tried. So one way to neutralize
what looked like as a result is

162
00:20:27,833 --> 00:20:33,833
you have a ‑‑ can put on the
graph where X is how much these
are the face value and the Y is

163
00:20:39,417 --> 00:20:45,583
how much the card is worth. So
on the left triangle, the
unvalued the cards are in green

164
00:20:45,583 --> 00:20:52,750
and the overpriced cards on the
right. Of course because the
averaged priced, card is under

165
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:58,750
value and over value you know
that is interacted to the ones
which are closer to the lines of

166
00:21:01,417 --> 00:21:06,875
fair price. What's interesting
is the people who are out here
outlier. And there is quite a

167
00:21:06,875 --> 00:21:13,083
few. The reason why we have a
lot of low value cards is
because when we model cards our

168
00:21:13,083 --> 00:21:18,542
card which have a shared ability
are mainly lower value. Not
because they the algorithm

169
00:21:18,542 --> 00:21:22,958
favors one over the other just
because when we did model, you
can see on the side, model them

170
00:21:22,958 --> 00:21:29,000
on the left side of the graph.
Highest cards usually have
special ability which is not

171
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:36,333
captured by this model. Which
another one for a special
ability. So no more blah, blah.

172
00:21:36,333 --> 00:21:42,333
What is the result? Well one of
the most under value card is
Soulfire. We do believe it

173
00:21:44,417 --> 00:21:51,250
actually should be at least one
mana. Light's Justice is also
undervalued. This one a lot of

174
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:58,417
people pointed out that they did
use fro attacks for one mana
which is somewhat of a kill if

175
00:21:58,417 --> 00:22:06,000
you think about it. Not
surprising the Mortal Coil or
shield are not perfectly and

176
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:12,917
Argent Squire and there is
also Explosive Trap and somehow
it actually gives you something

177
00:22:12,917 --> 00:22:17,417
which seems reasonable to most
people. The one which is a
bizarre is Sacrificial Pact,

178
00:22:17,417 --> 00:22:23,417
probably a bug in the code. We
also have high valued cards. The
one which is most powerful is

179
00:22:27,917 --> 00:22:33,917
fire which I believe it's
probably seven mana or six. So
somehow the algorithm gives you

180
00:22:36,458 --> 00:22:42,542
reasonable results so we believe
we're on the right track. If you
want to look at it full detail,

181
00:22:42,542 --> 00:22:48,417
all the partitions, all the card
ranks they're on my website. You
can just go there and we keep

182
00:22:48,417 --> 00:22:54,417
updating it. And show how to
make it better and we say let us
know. How do you take it to the

183
00:22:56,833 --> 00:23:02,167
next level? So far we have only
used cards the question is how
to make it better. It's really

184
00:23:02,167 --> 00:23:08,167
difficult. At least without
extra data. And this extra data
is how people play the game.

185
00:23:10,833 --> 00:23:15,875
Most of all the cards depend on
the state of the game. We don't
have insight about it unless you

186
00:23:15,875 --> 00:23:21,875
have a lot of replay. Of course
Hearthstone being very, very
new we don't have that. So for

187
00:23:26,042 --> 00:23:33,792
us we get our hand on the
hundred games played between May
and June. We'd like to thank our

188
00:23:33,792 --> 00:23:39,333
friends for that. Thank you very
much. We really hope that it
will give Blizzard will give to

189
00:23:39,333 --> 00:23:45,333
us and allow us to do our own
analysis. I don't want to do too
much but I think we're going to

190
00:23:48,125 --> 00:23:55,583
look at things ‑‑ there is no
reason to hide anything.
(inaudible). With this data you

191
00:23:55,583 --> 00:24:02,500
can do interesting stuff. The
first one is you can price a
card which has unique effect. To

192
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:08,500
get started. The Twilight Drake
is a card which is a 41 for four
mana and has special effects

193
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:17,458
when it comes into play it give
a battle cry, it will give one
half one additional half for

194
00:24:17,458 --> 00:24:23,417
each card you have in your hand.
Obviously the value of the card
depends on how many cards you

195
00:24:23,417 --> 00:24:29,708
have when you played it. So you
can build a model, say if I have
one card in my hand then you

196
00:24:29,708 --> 00:24:37,375
have one extra hand and then
it's one ‑‑ the real value is
1.3 mana. If I have two it's 1.9

197
00:24:37,375 --> 00:24:44,833
up to nine. You have a maximum
of ten cards. The maximum is
nine so it's 5.9. The question

198
00:24:44,833 --> 00:24:51,167
is now you are at this table you
need to use replay data to be
able to know how people played

199
00:24:51,167 --> 00:24:58,375
it. Are many playing it with
eight cards in their hands,
four, two cards? You do it and

200
00:24:58,375 --> 00:25:03,875
this thing is ‑‑ it draws a
exact graph. What you see is the
following. In the red on the

201
00:25:03,875 --> 00:25:10,917
left side you see when people
play it with less than up to
four cards and the card becomes

202
00:25:10,917 --> 00:25:16,042
undervalued. Basically if you
play with four cards you get
three mana values on your card.

203
00:25:16,042 --> 00:25:22,333
If you play with five cards you
have a 2.6 value. With six you
have a 2.2 value. This is a

204
00:25:22,333 --> 00:25:28,333
first one where if you play it
with seven or eight you get the
value of your cards. The average

205
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:36,458
real value of the card you take
the averaged, is 3.7 which is
right next to what is the face

206
00:25:36,458 --> 00:25:44,083
value. So based on that we do
think the price is fair.
Basically exactly what it is.

207
00:25:44,083 --> 00:25:48,750
It's also interesting to show
that looking at this we get the
same conclusion a blizzard so we

208
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:52,958
think we have something which is
very similar to what they have.
They have way better data and

209
00:25:52,958 --> 00:25:58,750
better insight. Let's look at
another card which is one of my
favorite cards, Edwin VanCleef.

210
00:25:58,750 --> 00:26:05,042
What it does is it will gain two
for each time you play a card
before it during the game. All

211
00:26:05,042 --> 00:26:10,958
you have to do is look at the
replay and how many cards were
played during the turn before it

212
00:26:10,958 --> 00:26:16,958
to get its value. And for
reasonable number of cards
played before I know you can go

213
00:26:16,958 --> 00:26:22,958
way (inaudible) for reasonable
number if you have two it's
1.09. If you have 6‑six you

214
00:26:29,792 --> 00:26:35,792
begin to get value out of it.
And when you play five or six
cards the value is just

215
00:26:40,792 --> 00:26:44,958
outrageous. If you play very,
very different points. As you
can see it is not at the time

216
00:26:44,958 --> 00:26:50,958
undervalued. It is. Two cards
before it ‑‑ I'm sorry three
cards. No two cards before it

217
00:26:53,958 --> 00:26:59,958
then you get five mana worth of
your cards. And for four cards
before you get to seven worth

218
00:27:02,083 --> 00:27:08,083
the cards and so forth. So the
average is 8.1. So the average
value VanCleef is 8.1. So as you

219
00:27:13,208 --> 00:27:19,458
claim this VanCleef is
undervalued and I believe the
value is between five and seven.

220
00:27:19,458 --> 00:27:25,458
I believe it should not be
eight, should not be nine. But
three in my opinion is way too.

221
00:27:27,458 --> 00:27:33,458
It is not according to the
(inaudible). People play four
for Chris but otherwise would

222
00:27:36,292 --> 00:27:42,292
give you a 6‑six or 8‑eight. So
this is one of the cards which
is the most undervalued. Last

223
00:27:47,042 --> 00:27:54,208
one. We go to a question about
how you deal with (inaudible).
So card which has (inaudible)

224
00:27:54,208 --> 00:28:00,208
affect is one of the simplest
ones. What it actually do is it
does damage of the minion. So

225
00:28:02,417 --> 00:28:08,958
easy right. All you have to do
is count how many minion you
have on the Board then multiply

226
00:28:08,958 --> 00:28:14,958
by number of damage and voila
right. I look at these numbers
and there's something completely

227
00:28:17,875 --> 00:28:23,875
wrong here right. Two minion on
your cards is already worth
13 points of mana. Well

228
00:28:28,333 --> 00:28:32,292
something is going wrong
somewhere. It doesn't make any
sense. What's wrong? It turns

229
00:28:32,292 --> 00:28:38,292
out because we use the broad
damage. Remember I told you we
tried to be clever and single

230
00:28:42,167 --> 00:28:47,458
targets versus multiple targets.
This is what happens when you
try to be too clever. Okay let's

231
00:28:47,458 --> 00:28:53,458
try again. Go back to single
card. Way better. Now it makes
more sense. That's how we used

232
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:02,000
we should not use multi‑target
versus single target. You should
only use one board, not two. And

233
00:29:04,625 --> 00:29:08,500
it makes sense. Now the card
becomes a good deal when you
have three minions. Same thing

234
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:14,500
you can see visually sometimes
it's undervalued. Sometime it's
overvalued. Most of the time

235
00:29:17,792 --> 00:29:23,292
it's between the two so the card
is perfectly balanced. The
lesson is don't try to be too

236
00:29:23,292 --> 00:29:27,875
smart. We also like this idea
because actually looking at it
helps us value it because we do

237
00:29:27,875 --> 00:29:33,875
make sense. And when something
is strange we look at it helps
us validate and we're going to

238
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:43,000
tell you about how you can
predict and will let you tell a
little about that. >> Hello

239
00:29:54,333 --> 00:30:01,250
everybody. My name is Celine and
I'm going to show you in game
two. The tool is a web

240
00:30:01,250 --> 00:30:07,375
application written Titan. It
runs on a small web server,
called Flask. So you can just

241
00:30:07,375 --> 00:30:14,083
get a web page. Just to your
game as you can see on the
screen. Or you can use any

242
00:30:14,083 --> 00:30:20,083
devices with web browser such as
a tablet. For this tool
implements all the algorithms.

243
00:30:26,708 --> 00:30:32,708
So the main screen in our tool
is a realtime dashboard. Use it
to track again metrics, play

244
00:30:37,250 --> 00:30:42,708
cards, and predict the cards
when you open and join your
game. So the first box on top of

245
00:30:42,708 --> 00:30:48,708
the game metrics. So mana
advantage is difference between
how much mana you spend and how

246
00:30:51,958 --> 00:30:57,958
much mana you open and spend, At
the page it is the difference
between how many cards you drew

247
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:09,917
and how many cards you open and
drew. And the other advantage is
the difference between how many

248
00:31:09,917 --> 00:31:15,875
cards you have in hand and how
many cards you're opponent has
in hand. So this metrics appears

249
00:31:15,875 --> 00:31:21,458
in green. If you have the
advantage. And in orange if the
advantage is for your opponent.

250
00:31:21,458 --> 00:31:27,458
In our study we found that those
metrics are the most predictive
of the game outcome. So we won't

251
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:35,500
go into details today due to
lack of time, but we will do a
blog post later about it.

252
00:31:38,833 --> 00:31:44,833
Metrics you can see your deck.
So you can see how many card of
each type you have in your deck

253
00:31:55,958 --> 00:32:01,958
in the two columns. Two for
total. Which one of them are on
the Board in green. And P for

254
00:32:05,167 --> 00:32:07,167
played in red in the G Column.
So below your deck there is a
box that shows what cards your

255
00:32:07,167 --> 00:32:09,167
opponent played. Every time your
opponent plays a card, it will
appear in this box. Same with

256
00:32:09,167 --> 00:32:11,167
total card in your deck, T for
Total in Column and played card
in the P Column for played and

257
00:32:11,167 --> 00:32:13,167
how many are dead in the two
columns, D for dead. So below
your deck there is a third box

258
00:32:13,167 --> 00:32:15,167
that shows what cards your
opponent played, overtime your
opponent plays a card it will

259
00:32:15,167 --> 00:32:18,042
appear in this box. Same with
the total card in the T column
and the dead card in the P

260
00:32:18,042 --> 00:32:25,583
column and dead card in the T
column. The last is the final
box which will show you

261
00:32:25,583 --> 00:32:32,250
prediction of which card your
opponent is going to play based
on the previous cards he's

262
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:39,792
played. So how did we manage to
get the game data? We could use
packet sniffing meeting to get

263
00:32:39,792 --> 00:32:46,458
the game data. It gives you the
best data which is a violation
of bus ops of service so we

264
00:32:46,458 --> 00:32:52,458
didn't use it. We could use OCR
for good recognitions so it
gives you a good data. But it

265
00:32:55,167 --> 00:33:01,167
costs a lot of CPUs and is not
very reliable. So we ruled it
out. So we ended up using the

266
00:33:04,042 --> 00:33:08,333
Debug log. So you can put your
game in debit mode. It is a
simple method to get awesome

267
00:33:08,333 --> 00:33:14,333
data. But it has some
limitations. Like game data you
can see your opponent, play and

268
00:33:17,458 --> 00:33:23,458
rank or which card attack which
card and there's updates. So
(inaudible) system as good as

269
00:33:27,542 --> 00:33:33,542
the one in (inaudible). So now
you will see it in action in a
short video. So this is the left

270
00:33:40,792 --> 00:33:46,792
side of the game. I am playing
against him. So I show my card
and you will see he starts with

271
00:33:53,708 --> 00:34:01,208
an extra card in his hand
because he has to draw and that
advantage. I am picking up a

272
00:34:01,208 --> 00:34:05,917
card. So we have the same number
of cards as you can see on the
dashboard. There's no more

273
00:34:05,917 --> 00:34:11,917
advantage for Elie. Now I'm
playing Argent Squire. So you
can see the card will appear in

274
00:34:16,583 --> 00:34:22,583
green in my deck. And I have
spent one mana point. Now as the
game evolves, the changes and

275
00:34:26,958 --> 00:34:34,208
the prediction appears at the
bottom. You can collect your
data to get more room for your

276
00:34:34,208 --> 00:34:40,208
(inaudible). And now I'm going
to play advisory. And let's get
a closer look. In the

277
00:34:42,708 --> 00:34:48,708
prediction. So yes it's work.
(Applause) He tries to kill me
with (inaudible). (Laughter) It

278
00:34:58,042 --> 00:35:04,042
saves me. In addition to the
(inaudible) you can also see the
(inaudible) in the screen. It

279
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:20,000
allows you to see what happened
turn by turn during the game. So
our tool will be available next

280
00:35:24,625 --> 00:35:29,625
week on github. So we currently
need help with how to improve
points using OCR, currently

281
00:35:29,625 --> 00:35:35,625
using text file. Need someone to
display the game history,
macquest, the Windows packaging

282
00:35:39,250 --> 00:35:45,250
and (inaudible). If you want
more info don't be afraid to
talk to us after the

283
00:35:50,708 --> 00:35:58,208
presentation. Thanks. Back to
you now. (Applause) >> All
right. Before you get all your

284
00:35:58,208 --> 00:36:05,875
hopes too high, and tell you
about how black magic is done.
Just a word of disclaimer.

285
00:36:05,875 --> 00:36:10,958
Because Naxramas has been
released (inaudible) so some
shifting, the prediction are not

286
00:36:10,958 --> 00:36:18,542
accurate. As I said we don't
have access to a lot of games.
So it takes us awhile to build a

287
00:36:18,542 --> 00:36:25,458
model, so expect it to not to
perform well for the next few
weeks. That being said, it will

288
00:36:25,458 --> 00:36:31,625
catch up as soon as the number
of cards has been released and
tabulated. Probably next season.

289
00:36:31,625 --> 00:36:37,792
Which is August. End of August.
It's very simple. We model card
affinity which is which card

290
00:36:37,792 --> 00:36:42,917
plays with each other then we
have an evaluation function
which will return one of the

291
00:36:42,917 --> 00:36:49,917
most affinity to be played based
on previous cards played by your
opponent. Then we have a tool.

292
00:36:49,917 --> 00:36:55,917
The tool goes through a bunch of
replay. Then learn from those
played (inaudible). Then we have

293
00:36:58,167 --> 00:37:04,208
this tool in the game which has
the algorithm and shows the card
that has been played and tells

294
00:37:04,208 --> 00:37:11,042
me the most likely card to be
played. That's basically what it
looks like. We're going to see

295
00:37:11,042 --> 00:37:17,500
each and that will be the last
part of the talk. As I said,
Hearthstone have about

296
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:23,667
500 yards. If we were to look at
all the card combinations it
would be almost impossible. We

297
00:37:23,667 --> 00:37:29,667
would have an impossible number
of combinations. So we expose
the fact that in practice cards

298
00:37:32,542 --> 00:37:38,167
really work well together and
some cards do not work well
together. You have the combo and

299
00:37:38,167 --> 00:37:43,333
the combo is (inaudible) plus
force of nature which is one.
It's likely you have the other.

300
00:37:43,333 --> 00:37:49,333
On the other hand, you do not
have force of nature. Does it
make any sense this is not what

301
00:37:49,333 --> 00:37:55,333
you need to model? We model
after things like this. We use
simple system, you can see which

302
00:37:57,375 --> 00:38:02,958
is called end run. Here is the
simple versions which is called
bigrams which is modeling pair

303
00:38:02,958 --> 00:38:08,208
cards. What we look at is we
look at the replay as the
sequence of cards which has been

304
00:38:08,208 --> 00:38:13,500
played by all opponents
regardless of the turn and say
the (inaudible) has been played

305
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:19,542
then the day played the task
master. That's one bigram. We
recall the infinity between the

306
00:38:19,542 --> 00:38:24,875
two. We say if you played the
armor with me then you are
likely to play the task master.

307
00:38:24,875 --> 00:38:30,500
We look at second part of the
stream, well the task master is
followed by accolades of pain so

308
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:36,375
we call there is an affinity
between those two cards. That
being said we know the cards are

309
00:38:36,375 --> 00:38:42,375
random. Right. You get one card
random so to model that we use
what we call unordered engram.

310
00:38:44,750 --> 00:38:50,750
Where we say (inaudible). If you
play sometimes armor (inaudible)
later you are likely to play

311
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:07,000
task master. You are likely to
play (inaudible). We also try
(inaudible). Turns out the best

312
00:39:09,208 --> 00:39:15,208
model is in this one which is
(inaudible). How do we value the
cards? Very simple again. Daily

313
00:39:18,625 --> 00:39:24,625
poison and shift which are two
cards. Then we say what is the
affinity of those cards? For

314
00:39:28,042 --> 00:39:32,583
daily poison we know that that
Fan of Knight and then blade 250
times. So we look at those. For

315
00:39:32,583 --> 00:39:38,583
sure we know that Fairy has been
400 times and you played
(inaudible). So we combine them

316
00:39:45,833 --> 00:39:52,500
and again very simple
(inaudible). We say how many
times those appear you get the

317
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:59,917
ranking. The ranking is on top
because it's 250 plus 400 one
followed by the 500. And then

318
00:39:59,917 --> 00:40:04,792
you put the card wherever you
want and say this is my
separation because I only want

319
00:40:04,792 --> 00:40:10,792
two. That's how it works. It
turns out more complicated it
won't work. This one works

320
00:40:14,833 --> 00:40:20,417
really well. How did we do? We
took 50,000 replays and we did
by class because each card has

321
00:40:20,417 --> 00:40:24,625
some unique cards and we did one
track. And we run the code,
first we write the code then we

322
00:40:24,625 --> 00:40:30,625
run the code. Then we ran.
Actually the algorithm basically
(inaudible) was in less than

323
00:40:38,958 --> 00:40:44,958
three minutes. Then victory. I
was actually shocked at how good
the thing was. By turn three,

324
00:40:49,042 --> 00:40:53,792
the highest prediction had a
97 percent chance to be played.
Which mean that's out of 100

325
00:40:53,792 --> 00:41:00,500
games, the first prediction
returned after three will be
played. Sometime in the future

326
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:06,542
we don't know if it is the next
card but it will be played. If
you want to look at it deeper,

327
00:41:06,542 --> 00:41:12,000
this is a curve of the average
prediction of the algorithm for
ten predictions, turn by turn.

328
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:16,542
You can see actually why.
Because you get more and more
information. The more cards that

329
00:41:16,542 --> 00:41:23,792
have been played the more we can
look at the affinity so the
accuracy increased and then it

330
00:41:23,792 --> 00:41:27,917
starts to decrease after turn
eight because there's less cards
in the deck of your opponent. So

331
00:41:27,917 --> 00:41:35,833
the balance is somewhat between
times four and times eight. If
you look at the ranking

332
00:41:35,833 --> 00:41:41,833
functions. The ranking functions
do work. The green represents
our best prediction. The orange

333
00:41:44,792 --> 00:41:51,458
represents our lowest prediction
which is number ten. You can
clearly see that the best one

334
00:41:51,458 --> 00:41:58,250
actually extremely good up in
the high 90s starting in at
three whereas the lowest one is

335
00:41:58,250 --> 00:42:02,375
barely above 20. And they are
converging because the algorithm
makes less and less mistakes but

336
00:42:02,375 --> 00:42:08,375
there is also less and less room
for error. So the last I wanted
to tell you guys hindsight we

337
00:42:11,833 --> 00:42:17,083
should have two hours and
45 minutes. We didn't know where
we were going when we applied

338
00:42:17,083 --> 00:42:23,167
for the talk. So we wanted to
tell you about predicting the
outcome. We also are looking

339
00:42:23,167 --> 00:42:29,167
into optimizing that deck for
mana. Because we know mana is
the key factor to win. And by

340
00:42:31,917 --> 00:42:39,167
popular request we're looking at
proper requests and comparing
deck of time. Why is winning

341
00:42:39,167 --> 00:42:46,333
versus control, how it's work.
What are the parameters and
stuff. I think we are looking

342
00:42:46,333 --> 00:42:52,333
forward to do is share ideas of
things you would like us to do.
We'd like to finish by giving a

343
00:42:55,542 --> 00:43:01,667
shout out to a lot of people who
gave us feedback. We love to do
it! We read comment that's

344
00:43:01,667 --> 00:43:09,250
people post to us. It's really
important to help us get better.
But that being said, big thank

345
00:43:09,250 --> 00:43:14,583
you to you people. I would like
to thank Neal and Zac which
spent a lot of time helping us

346
00:43:14,583 --> 00:43:21,125
prepare and gave us inside with
feedback. And our anonymous
friend who gives us replays.

347
00:43:21,125 --> 00:43:27,125
Thanks a lot. (Applause)
