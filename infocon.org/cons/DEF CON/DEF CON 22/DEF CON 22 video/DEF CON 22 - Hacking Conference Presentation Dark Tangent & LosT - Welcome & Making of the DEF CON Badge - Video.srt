1
22:43:49,458 --> 22:44:14,792
>> Welcome to DEF CON. I'm Russ-
Chief of Operations this year.
Hi Russ. Thank you. We have lots

2
22:44:02,250 --> 22:44:20,375
for you. We have our wonderful
speaker Goons. Is Jeff Moss in
any of these seats? It's been a

3
22:44:20,375 --> 22:44:25,083
long time to get to 22. We'll
let some other people talk about
the theme and how we got to this

4
22:44:25,083 --> 22:44:28,042
and you can read about it in the
program as well. Does everybody
have the red glasses this year?

5
22:44:28,042 --> 22:44:34,042
I hear a lot of no’s and a lot
yeses. If you don't you will
want those. All the signs and

6
22:44:33,417 --> 22:44:49,417
programs and everything you will
find some interesting stuff. So
the kind of theme this year is

7
22:44:49,417 --> 22:44:58,042
disobey and that's what we're
all doing. All right. Welcome to
the conference. How many of you

8
22:44:58,042 --> 22:45:04,333
are new? Who has not been here
before? Holy crap how did you
make it 22 years and not realize

9
22:45:04,333 --> 22:45:10,333
this was here? I was drunk. I
was trying to answer a call. So
there's an active badge contest

10
22:45:25,500 --> 22:45:30,667
every year and there's one going
right now and he's got a super
secret phone number and he's

11
22:45:30,667 --> 22:45:36,667
gotten 30 calls in the last 5
minutes. So we're going to
answer one if they call while

12
22:45:39,083 --> 22:45:46,333
we're on stage and you guys can
taunt them appropriately. So
yeah. I figured out when we ran

13
22:45:46,333 --> 22:45:52,333
out of badges that we had a lot
more people than we expected.
Surprise. We can't tell you how

14
22:45:54,833 --> 22:46:02,000
many badges we had. It was more
than 100 obviously. Hey is there
an echo up there on the top? I

15
22:46:02,000 --> 22:46:08,000
also wondered. Did you see the
delay? It took a second for the
sound to get up there. Hello?

16
22:46:20,333 --> 22:46:26,333
>>Hey Russ. >> Are you in the
audience? Are you in the opening
ceremonies? >> I'm right here.

17
22:46:34,917 --> 22:46:40,917
[Laughing]. >> The lights are
killing me. I can't see who it
is. So quick question for you.

18
22:46:44,875 --> 22:46:51,250
When did you find the number? >>
Last night. >> So you were one
of the hundreds of calls I got

19
22:46:51,250 --> 22:46:59,000
at about 3:00 this morning? >> I
think it was 11:00. >> So these
calls happened all night long

20
22:46:59,000 --> 22:47:06,333
last night. Anyway we'll talk ‑‑
>> It was a good idea. >> We'll
talk more about it. Anyway give

21
22:47:06,333 --> 22:47:13,542
the guy a hand. [Applause]. >>
All right so we have a lot of
really cool stuff going on this

22
22:47:13,542 --> 22:47:19,542
weekend. I hope you guys will
stay involved. Remember this Con
is what you make of it. If you

23
22:47:25,250 --> 22:47:31,458
sit on your butt and don't do
anything you are going to get a
fat butt. If you go to talk and

24
22:47:31,458 --> 22:47:38,083
meet people and interact with
contests, the organizers and
that kind of stuff you learn a

25
22:47:38,083 --> 22:47:44,083
lot and leave here happy and the
world will be peaceful and gummy
bears from now on out. >> I love

26
22:47:48,208 --> 22:47:55,458
you Russ. >> I love you too. I
will let this go. Look for some
surprises. Is it today? Later

27
22:47:55,458 --> 22:48:01,625
tomorrow? We've got some stuff
coming that's not in the program
and it was unannounced and has

28
22:48:01,625 --> 22:48:08,250
caused our security goons no end
of headaches but look for cool
stuff. Make sure you move around

29
22:48:08,250 --> 22:48:16,167
and get to the contest areas.
This is l0stboy. He made your
badges. He loves you. Good

30
22:48:16,167 --> 22:48:22,167
night. >> Do the hands one more
time for those that this is
their first DEFCON. Even up top?

31
22:48:28,125 --> 22:48:34,125
Man that spot is killing me.
Wow. How many of you from out of
the country? Wow. Welcome. Give

32
22:48:36,333 --> 22:48:44,125
those guys a hand for traveling
here. [Applause]. How many of
you didn't understand that

33
22:48:44,125 --> 22:48:50,125
question? [Laughing]. >> Oh
welcome you guys. Friday
morning. For those of you who

34
22:48:52,708 --> 22:48:57,875
are new and unaware so we do
like 101 and stuff like that on
Thursday but today is the day we

35
22:48:57,875 --> 22:49:04,208
officially open the conference
like Russ said for the past
years it's been Russ and I doing

36
22:49:04,208 --> 22:49:10,208
the opening ceremonies. If you
want to talk about that we can
talk about that later. Welcome.

37
22:49:12,208 --> 22:49:16,667
We're glad to have you. Thank
you to those of you who
traveled. How many of you had a

38
22:49:16,667 --> 22:49:22,500
clue what to expect before you
came here since we have so many
newbs this year? Seriously knew

39
22:49:22,500 --> 22:49:28,667
what you were talking into? How
many still have no clue what
you're doing here? Yeah. That's

40
22:49:28,667 --> 22:49:34,667
how I feel too. So Joe Grand did
the badge designs for the first
5 years we did electronic badges

41
22:49:38,917 --> 22:49:46,208
and then he went and was doing
his TV show and Jeff stepped up
and asked me to takeover doing

42
22:49:46,208 --> 22:49:50,875
badge design because of the work
I had done on the mystery
challenge. I would like to tell

43
22:49:50,875 --> 22:49:56,292
that story kind of to set the
stage for what it is that's
going on that might help explain

44
22:49:56,292 --> 22:50:01,667
to you guys. So it makes a
little more sense and also as
words of encouragement to try to

45
22:50:01,667 --> 22:50:05,417
get you involved in the
conference whether it's through
contests or talking to other

46
22:50:05,417 --> 22:50:11,417
people. My first DEF CON like
many of you I came by myself. I
didn't know anybody. And I

47
22:50:14,167 --> 22:50:20,167
competed in a contest and I
actually wasn't going to say
that but thank you for the

48
22:50:23,167 --> 22:50:30,042
comment and we're getting
another phone call. But through
that contest I actually met my

49
22:50:30,042 --> 22:50:36,042
lovely wife who is here in the
front row today. [Applause]. So
the prize in the contest may be

50
22:50:39,583 --> 22:50:47,125
companionship. Wait, does that
advocate something that we
shouldn't? Anyway so the mystery

51
22:50:47,125 --> 22:50:53,125
challenge was a contest and what
we were trying to do is increase
the participation in the badge

52
22:50:55,667 --> 22:51:00,458
challenge because every attendee
gets the badge and the bar was
set high so you had to spend

53
22:51:00,458 --> 22:51:06,667
most of your time doing this. In
fact a lot of people came just
to do that in the later years.

54
22:51:06,667 --> 22:51:13,375
So my first years we decided not
to do an electronic badge
because everybody came to expect

55
22:51:13,375 --> 22:51:17,667
it and we're trying to change
things up. And the badge focus
was the stuff around it, the

56
22:51:17,667 --> 22:51:23,667
mathematic I cans, the social
engineering and all rolled into
one. The intention was everybody

57
22:51:28,625 --> 22:51:33,375
would have something they can do
in the contest and it would
cause them to find someone else

58
22:51:33,375 --> 22:51:38,333
with the complementary skills so
it would increase communication
between the attendees and I try

59
22:51:38,333 --> 22:51:42,958
to do that every year. I try to
design things into the badge
contest and challenge that

60
22:51:42,958 --> 22:51:46,958
forces you to interact with
other people because some of us
as you know have a certain

61
22:51:46,958 --> 22:51:53,667
personality type that may be
less than favorable to social
situations. Is that a nice way

62
22:51:53,667 --> 22:52:01,333
of saying that? As I speak in
front of thousands. So for me
it's all about the people. I

63
22:52:01,333 --> 22:52:06,750
have to sit down and the problem
I face every year is most of you
guys are way smarter than I am

64
22:52:06,750 --> 22:52:11,292
and I have to come up with
something that's entertaining
for you that's not ridiculously

65
22:52:11,292 --> 22:52:17,042
stupid simple so it keeps you
intellectually entertained but
also solvable in a finite time.

66
22:52:17,042 --> 22:52:23,042
So trying to solve the problems
in the real world you're trying
to make an unsolvable or

67
22:52:28,417 --> 22:52:34,417
unbreakable cypher. I'm trying
to break one that smart people
can look at and solve. So I have

68
22:52:38,792 --> 22:52:44,792
to introduce flaws into the
systems that I design. And I
found that it's actually the

69
22:52:44,792 --> 22:52:49,750
same process that we as hackers
go through finding the flaws
except I'm implanting them in

70
22:52:49,750 --> 22:52:54,042
the system instead of
discovering them. It's kind of
reverse engineering if that

71
22:52:54,042 --> 22:53:00,042
makes sense. So let's talk a
little bit about this year.
First of all, are any of the

72
22:53:06,500 --> 22:53:12,042
Parallax folks in the audience?
Did any of you folks make it ‑‑
Ken can you stand up?

73
22:53:12,042 --> 22:53:18,042
[Applause]. Oh Chip is here.
Chip stand up. So I don't know
if you've all been watching the

74
22:53:23,333 --> 22:53:27,417
Twitter feeds. Those that
haven't looked at the badge it's
the Propellor chip from

75
22:53:27,417 --> 22:53:33,417
Parallax. They are near and dear
to my heart. Chip is the
creator. The grandparent of what

76
22:53:37,875 --> 22:53:43,875
you know as Arduino. Chip
started that whole thing of
taking the microcontroller and

77
22:53:49,833 --> 22:53:53,792
making it more accessible for
the audience. A lot of people
don't know thatch they've been

78
22:53:53,792 --> 22:53:58,917
birthed into the community.
Those ‑‑ how many of you
remember the basic stamp? Yeah.

79
22:53:58,917 --> 22:54:04,917
Give it a hand. [Applause]. So
there was some answers ‑‑ there
were some instances that

80
22:54:10,875 --> 22:54:16,875
happened. There was a badge
design done prior to the one
that you have and it used a

81
22:54:21,375 --> 22:54:25,500
different architecture and some
things happened and I had to
move to a different architecture

82
22:54:25,500 --> 22:54:31,500
with an incredibly insane time
scale. So I called up Ken and
said Ken can we make this happen

83
22:54:39,375 --> 22:54:45,417
and we turned this around in an
insane time scale for
production. And to make the real

84
22:54:45,417 --> 22:54:52,167
punch at the end we have talked
to Chip and Parallax announced
they open sourced the chip. They

85
22:54:52,167 --> 22:54:58,167
announced here and on the
website. Right? So they have
open sourced the Propellor chip

86
22:55:00,583 --> 22:55:05,958
on your badge and Chip is
releasing code you can all
download so you can emulate your

87
22:55:05,958 --> 22:55:11,958
badge and different things like
that. [Applause]. So in addition
to Ken is John in the audience?

88
22:55:19,292 --> 22:55:25,292
There's another name on the back
of your badge which is John
Williams. John was a co‑worker,

89
22:55:29,167 --> 22:55:36,667
a colleague when I was at
Parallax and now those that read
nuts and bolts magazine you see

90
22:55:36,667 --> 22:55:43,333
articles he has written. He's a
dear friend and due to the time
scale referencing back to I

91
22:55:43,333 --> 22:55:49,000
found my wife at DEF CON I was
slated to be married one week
after we started design on the

92
22:55:49,000 --> 22:55:55,000
batch this year. I called in a
favor from John and we worked
together along with the guys at

93
22:55:55,000 --> 22:56:00,583
Parallax and put this together.
Because John and I worked on
this together I put his name on

94
22:56:00,583 --> 22:56:05,417
it as well. He will be here in
the hardware hacking village. So
if you have questions and things

95
22:56:05,417 --> 22:56:11,417
like that many of the libraries
that we use when we wrote the
code for the badge are John’s; I

96
22:56:14,667 --> 22:56:19,083
extended Chip's serial object
and things to add elements and
we gave you all that code on the

97
22:56:19,083 --> 22:56:26,292
conference CD so you have it.
All the software and tools for
development for the architecture

98
22:56:26,292 --> 22:56:32,292
are free. So you can go and
start messing around with your
badge. So give those guys a

99
22:56:34,333 --> 22:56:40,333
hand. [Applause]. Because
honestly it would not have
happened this year without John

100
22:56:43,833 --> 22:56:50,167
and Parallax. It would not have
happened. In addition to that if
you want to see more interesting

101
22:56:50,167 --> 22:56:55,417
things you may have noticed
there's a talk this year on the
prop lane that's Russ and myself

102
22:56:55,417 --> 22:57:02,792
and other folks take the DEF CON
20 badge and you can use this
year's badge to do encrypters

103
22:57:02,792 --> 22:57:06,625
with your badge. So to
facilitate that everyone take
your badge and look at the

104
22:57:06,625 --> 22:57:14,167
front. Look underneath the chip.
You will notice there's a series
of pads for those that are not

105
22:57:14,167 --> 22:57:19,417
familiar with the PCB lingo.
Those are the parts that you
would solder to. There's exposed

106
22:57:19,417 --> 22:57:25,250
copper pads but those that do
design and familiar with these
may wonder what the hell is

107
22:57:25,250 --> 22:57:31,250
that. So we took a circle pad
and we basically split it in
half with a trace in the middle.

108
22:58:23,875 --> 22:58:26,125
If you want to remove a part
that's connected to the chip you
take a razor blade and cut

109
22:58:26,125 --> 22:58:28,125
through the middle. There's a
thin trace connecting the two
halves of the circle so you hack

110
22:58:28,125 --> 22:58:30,125
the part off the board without
desoldering the part. If you we
want this part back you solder

111
22:58:30,125 --> 22:58:32,125
across those and bring it back
again. But that gives you the
ability to remove components

112
22:58:32,125 --> 22:58:34,125
from the board electrically and
you have break outs of all of
the IO's on the side so you can

113
22:58:34,125 --> 22:58:36,125
use this as a development
platform or as something to mess
around with. So we tried to

114
22:58:36,125 --> 22:58:38,125
facilitate giving you something
at the caverns after you go home
is in a useable form and those

115
22:58:38,125 --> 22:58:40,125
that have not programmed a
microprogrammer before, you are
ready to go. You're welcome.

116
22:58:40,125 --> 22:58:42,125
[Applause]. Those of you that
are new, there are elements of
cryptography in linguistics

117
22:58:42,125 --> 22:58:48,125
embedded throughout the
conference. You may have noticed
strange symbols and marking on

118
22:59:07,250 --> 22:59:09,250
your lanyard. We're trying to
involve all aspects of the
conference in the badge. I'm

119
22:59:09,250 --> 22:59:11,833
trying to draw more people in
because we don't have moments
like we used to anymore because

120
22:59:11,833 --> 22:59:17,458
things like Google. Now people
have instant gratification and
instant solutions to problems. I

121
22:59:17,458 --> 22:59:23,458
think magic is ruined in the
world because of the internet
which is sad and I'm trying to

122
22:59:25,750 --> 22:59:32,125
bring it back through the stuff
I do. A kid if he wants to know
how magic is done he looks it up

123
22:59:32,125 --> 22:59:38,125
on Google. And that kind of
magic and mystery is stuff I
enjoy. That's why my first

124
22:59:43,458 --> 22:59:49,542
contest was called mystery
challenge. So we're very, very
happy to have all of you here.

125
22:59:49,542 --> 22:59:54,708
This is DEF CON 22. We've going
going for 22 years and the only
way this conference goes is from

126
22:59:54,708 --> 23:00:01,083
people like you. We're
appreciative to have those that
traveled from so far. I said

127
23:00:01,083 --> 23:00:05,500
this in my 101 talk. No one in
this conference is
unapproachable. If they are

128
23:00:05,500 --> 23:00:11,500
they're a Dick and we don't want
them here. So...  [Applause]. I
mean I was just like you guys

129
23:00:17,833 --> 23:00:24,917
and look I'm ‑‑ I'm way not as
smart ‑‑ see the grammar there.
I did that on purpose for my

130
23:00:24,917 --> 23:00:32,500
mother who is in the front row.
Say hi mom. [Applause]. Okay.
Now to answer a question I've

131
23:00:32,500 --> 23:00:38,500
gotten both from email and
Twitter for the past days, the
next question is how do I get

132
23:00:41,125 --> 23:00:45,833
involved in things like doing
the badge challenge. Find a
group of people marking codes on

133
23:00:45,833 --> 23:00:51,833
the floor or people looking at
the back of their lanyard. I put
it on the part behind your neck

134
23:00:56,000 --> 23:00:59,000
for a reason. Because it
encourages you to talk to
somebody because you can't

135
23:00:59,000 --> 23:01:06,083
casually walk by and see what
they have on their lanyard. It's
actually an inconvenience to

136
23:01:06,083 --> 23:01:12,708
take it off. So it fosters a
temporal buffer for
communication. That's why it's

137
23:01:12,708 --> 23:01:18,708
annoyingly on the back of your
neck instead of easily on the
side. Please come up and say hi.

138
23:01:21,500 --> 23:01:29,208
I can't give you anymore
information without spoiling
stages of the badge challenge. I

139
23:01:29,208 --> 23:01:36,542
have embedded in the contest
means of finding hints and
things like that. Next year I

140
23:01:36,542 --> 23:01:41,750
hope to do some more interesting
stuff. I'm going to clear it
with Russ and Jeff. I have big

141
23:01:41,750 --> 23:01:48,958
plans for next year and I'm
trying to build off this year.
So I'm very humbled when I come

142
23:01:48,958 --> 23:01:55,000
to DEF CON every year because
people complement me and say we
love the stuff you're doing and

143
23:01:55,000 --> 23:02:00,083
it still dumb founds me the
stupid stuff I do is found
entertaining by you guys so

144
23:02:00,083 --> 23:02:06,083
thank you. Thank you for ‑‑
[Applause]. We were hoping Jeff
might make it but is that going

145
23:02:13,292 --> 23:02:19,292
to happen Russ? Do you know if
Jeff is going to make it at all?
>> Hello. [Inaudible]. >>Hello?

146
23:02:30,750 --> 23:02:36,750
[random sounds] Hello? Oh they
skipped it. I want to see what
they put. Hey, Jeff is here. You

147
23:02:48,750 --> 23:02:54,750
made it. Everybody the reason
we're here, Jeff Moss.
[Applause]. >> So we totally did

148
23:03:03,375 --> 23:03:08,000
not plan that. I'm walking down
there and I see my name. I was
like I better hurry the fuck up.

149
23:03:08,000 --> 23:03:14,000
Thanks for coming. So I don't
know what they've said so I
don't want to contradict them.

150
23:03:18,292 --> 23:03:23,208
No I just want to thank
everybody for coming and point
out a couple things we try to do

151
23:03:23,208 --> 23:03:28,708
every year and I'm not sure if
Russ covered it. But one of the
big challenges doing a show like

152
23:03:28,708 --> 23:03:34,125
this is ‑‑ what do we do with
everybody? And it turns out we
don't really have to figure that

153
23:03:34,125 --> 23:03:37,625
out. You guys are smart enough
to figure it out yourself. We
just have to give you

154
23:03:37,625 --> 23:03:42,708
opportunities and you'll do
whatever you want. So this year
we've tried doing things like

155
23:03:42,708 --> 23:03:47,333
the privacy and crypto village.
I'm trying to come up with new
villages. Split you up so you

156
23:03:47,333 --> 23:03:51,333
can meet people that are like
minded. Maybe you want to chill
out and meet other people. How

157
23:03:51,333 --> 23:03:57,333
do you do that? We have a
hardware hacking and we already
have WiFi. Well, maybe now

158
23:04:01,917 --> 23:04:07,917
there's people that want to do
defense. Let's try to grow the
forensic side of the business.

159
23:04:11,292 --> 23:04:16,333
Okay we'll do the giant wall of
sheep village because those guys
wanted to step up and try it. 

160
23:04:16,333 --> 23:04:22,833
it was like unleashing… like a
tidal wave. We can give you your
own space. Great we already

161
23:04:22,833 --> 23:04:28,750
built a village. Like a village.
You look at that and they go
crazy. Oh we're going to need

162
23:04:28,750 --> 23:04:34,875
like 19 projectors. That's like
a third of all the projectors
for the whole conference. No we

163
23:04:34,875 --> 23:04:40,917
really need 19 projectors. So I
find this community you give
them an inch and they take a

164
23:04:40,917 --> 23:04:45,708
mile and invent really cool
stuff so I'm thinking like this
one small thing and they come up

165
23:04:45,708 --> 23:04:50,958
with this whole universe. And
that's what so awesome about
this community is because it's

166
23:04:50,958 --> 23:04:57,000
exceeded my imagination every
year. I mean every year shit
happens that we would never have

167
23:04:57,000 --> 23:05:02,250
conceived of that you guys are
like oh yeah of course I have to
connect the pony express to the

168
23:05:02,250 --> 23:05:08,625
blimp and drift it over the pool
and get the porn star's phone
number. I mean that's what you

169
23:05:08,625 --> 23:05:16,083
do. Right? It's like, yeah I
guess so. Yeah I was going to do
that… later. I haven't gotten

170
23:05:16,083 --> 23:05:23,333
around to that yet. So then this
year we also have the temper
evident village turned into a

171
23:05:23,333 --> 23:05:29,958
village and now we've expanded
that this year there's a badge
counterfeiting contest. And so

172
23:05:29,958 --> 23:05:35,417
I'll give you history there. It
was every year people tried to
counterfeit these badges and

173
23:05:35,417 --> 23:05:40,417
every year we would try to make
it harder or a little different.
So part of the reason we didn't

174
23:05:40,417 --> 23:05:44,208
tell people what we were doing
is we wanted to make it hard for
the counterfeiters. Well,

175
23:05:44,208 --> 23:05:51,208
they’ve gotten REALLY good! If
you gotten to the point you can
counterfeit it, if you can do

176
23:05:51,208 --> 23:05:57,958
that you should probably just be
allowed in. Isn't that the right
mentality? [Applause]. Yeah. So

177
23:05:57,958 --> 23:06:03,958
we're like well we don't want
mass production that's against
the spirit but if you yourself

178
23:06:06,667 --> 23:06:12,667
can do a run off that's so
awesome that gets past everybody
you probably spent most the con

179
23:06:15,708 --> 23:06:21,583
your room so you should probably
show off how cool and how you
did it. I would love to get a

180
23:06:21,583 --> 23:06:27,583
talk together and have them talk
about the challenges of the
badge and how they got around it

181
23:06:31,125 --> 23:06:38,167
so we can learn. Finally one of
the guys came forward and said
that's me. I was the guy. So now

182
23:06:38,167 --> 23:06:44,250
one of the guys is running the
badge counterfeit ing contest.
We had Ryan on the phone and

183
23:06:44,250 --> 23:06:51,542
Ryan designs the badges. So he
was like well how did you get
around the flame mark on the

184
23:06:51,542 --> 23:06:57,583
titanium. Oh well that was lemon
juice and an oven at
400 degrees. Yeah but that had a

185
23:06:57,583 --> 23:07:03,583
unique twist. Yeah but you rub a
thing in a linear direction and
spin it. So it's really awesome.

186
23:07:08,167 --> 23:07:12,875
You think you're inventing the
super technique to defend and
they come up with an awesome

187
23:07:12,875 --> 23:07:19,500
attack with lemon juice and a
gummy bear. So... So this year
that's a contest. That's a

188
23:07:19,500 --> 23:07:25,625
thing. I want to give people the
creative outlet. So I want more
ideas. This year I was doing

189
23:07:25,625 --> 23:07:30,625
this media server every year and
I want to make this awesome
media server and you guys are

190
23:07:30,625 --> 23:07:35,208
going to download everything.
Then I realized if you plugged
in and tried to download

191
23:07:35,208 --> 23:07:41,042
everything you would be here for
5 days. You just can't download
fast enough. And talking to a

192
23:07:41,042 --> 23:07:45,208
friend he was like that's an
interesting engineering problem.
How do you move that much data

193
23:07:45,208 --> 23:07:50,625
to this many people if they want
it? I don't know but I probably
need like ‑‑ so now I have

194
23:07:50,625 --> 23:07:58,083
ridiculous hard drives with like
RAID 10 with dual 10 gigabit
networks bonded. That's still

195
23:07:58,083 --> 23:08:04,083
not going to work. I'll buy hard
drive duplicators. Nothing beats
anything but a fed ex truck of

196
23:08:06,750 --> 23:08:12,750
hard drives. So now we have 6 of
these dupers that do 11 at a
time and you can check in the

197
23:08:15,000 --> 23:08:21,000
morning and at the end you will
have a copy of all the Con video
I can find and it's in beta

198
23:08:21,000 --> 23:08:27,000
still and I'm realizing that's
not fast enough either. It takes
11 hours to dupe one 4TB drive.

199
23:08:33,208 --> 23:08:41,167
>> [Off mic] >> I thought it was
going to be 3 drives now I got
basically everything to fit on 2

200
23:08:41,167 --> 23:08:45,208
drives and the queues are filled
up and we're done. That was like
$15,000 of hard drive dupers and

201
23:08:45,208 --> 23:08:47,208
it's done. We're full. So next
year we'll do a disk duplication
village. [Applause]. Because I

202
23:08:47,208 --> 23:08:53,208
realize I'll go broke trying to
do any one thing for everybody.
We just can't afford it at what

203
23:09:07,667 --> 23:09:13,667
we charge but if you guys bring
all YOUR hard drive duping
equipment... See how that works?

204
23:09:17,375 --> 23:09:25,167
That's really good. So this is
how things happen. So I just ‑‑
I don't want to redo everything

205
23:09:25,167 --> 23:09:31,250
they said but this is the spirit
of DEF CON and I want everybody
to feel open and involved and

206
23:09:31,250 --> 23:09:36,083
take a chance and start
something up and I'm just really
excited that everybody is here

207
23:09:36,083 --> 23:09:41,500
and sitting paying attention to
what I'm saying and actually
caring. So that's really cool.

208
23:09:41,500 --> 23:09:47,500
And don't be intimidated by the
Vader. This is a friendly Vader.
So the only other thing is

209
23:09:51,375 --> 23:09:55,667
there's always a little
controversy. This year you might
have noticed the TOR talk was

210
23:09:55,667 --> 23:10:01,333
pulled. Other than that, there's
not too many talks that have
been pulled. This is something I

211
23:10:01,333 --> 23:10:07,333
want to ask you. Who here by
show of hands or applause does
this feel to you like the top of

212
23:10:09,958 --> 23:10:16,167
the DotCom bubble a little bit?
You know the energy, the
opportunities, everybody's got

213
23:10:16,167 --> 23:10:21,625
something going O everybody's
got full employment if you want
it. It's starting to feel like

214
23:10:21,625 --> 23:10:27,625
the DotCom. Let's do something
with it before it explodes in
the next couple years. >> [Off

215
23:10:35,292 --> 23:10:41,292
mic] >> Thirty to 40 percent is
new. Yeah. >> [Off mic] >> No. I
don't want to call them out

216
23:10:45,083 --> 23:10:51,083
because they might be
embarrassed. Who here this is
the first time to DEF CON? Okay.

217
23:10:53,250 --> 23:10:59,000
How did you hear about us? Raise
your hand if it was a friend,
word of mouth kind of thing. And

218
23:10:59,000 --> 23:11:05,000
who here because of our
advertisement in time magazine?
So that's how we've grown.

219
23:11:08,167 --> 23:11:15,750
There's no money for
advertising. >> [Off mic] >>
You'll deposit the money with me

220
23:11:15,750 --> 23:11:23,292
after the Nigerian Price gives
it to you. So that's how we
grew, word of mouth. Turns out

221
23:11:23,292 --> 23:11:26,792
that's the most valuable
advertising there is in the
industry and also the thing

222
23:11:26,792 --> 23:11:34,667
that's free. So I'm all for
that. Because we can't compete
against the marketing of an RSA,

223
23:11:34,667 --> 23:11:40,667
nor would we want to. We have
these debates should we change
this part of the CON? You know,

224
23:11:44,667 --> 23:11:49,833
if they don't want to come they
won't show up. It's like if we
don't want them to be here or

225
23:11:49,833 --> 23:11:54,667
they don't want to be here
that's fine. I can go and
uninvite and say hey feds take a

226
23:11:54,667 --> 23:12:00,417
year off because I don't have
like a marketing engine or P & L
that says I have to get as many

227
23:12:00,417 --> 23:12:06,417
people on the planet here. No,
it's like I need the right kind
of people here. I need people

228
23:12:06,417 --> 23:12:10,792
who want to be here to be here
not that have been ordered by
their boss to show up. So a lot

229
23:12:10,792 --> 23:12:15,542
of times it's like that might
not be corporate friendly and
the other half of us say you

230
23:12:15,542 --> 23:12:21,375
know what we're a hacking
conference, we don't really
care. So that has given us so

231
23:12:21,375 --> 23:12:28,042
much freedom to do what we kind
of want to do and look at how
many people respond to that. How

232
23:12:28,042 --> 23:12:32,958
many of you by show of hands are
happy that we've never ‑‑ we
just don't take sponsorship

233
23:12:32,958 --> 23:12:38,958
dollars ever. You don't see an
advertisement anywhere.
[Applause]. So like that would

234
23:12:43,958 --> 23:12:49,208
be really great if I had all the
money from the sponsors but then
you get these problems like I

235
23:12:49,208 --> 23:12:54,167
really want to speak and I just
gave you $40,000. It's like well
sorry guys you don't get to

236
23:12:54,167 --> 23:12:59,417
speak. I don't want ‑‑ >> [Off
mic] >> You don't have anything
to say. [Laughing]. So we can

237
23:12:59,417 --> 23:13:05,417
avoid all these problems. And I
think people respond to it
because you just want to be here

238
23:13:10,875 --> 23:13:14,583
and you don't want to worry
about like what's the hidden
agenda. I want you to worry

239
23:13:14,583 --> 23:13:20,583
about his agenda and his agenda
and connectivities. I would love
for to you tell me if you

240
23:13:23,625 --> 23:13:28,375
respond to that or if that was
the thing of the 90's or 2000's.
Everybody has sponsorships now

241
23:13:28,375 --> 23:13:35,375
so what's the big deal? I think
there are things about the show
that you like and I want to know

242
23:13:35,375 --> 23:13:40,542
is there something new you would
like to see. You know? So we
always try to adapt and the show

243
23:13:40,542 --> 23:13:45,208
is a reflection of the people
who come so sometimes when you
hear complaints like man I wish

244
23:13:45,208 --> 23:13:50,583
it was like it was 10 years ago.
I do too. But don't you want
more people to know what we're

245
23:13:50,583 --> 23:13:55,667
doing? Don't you want more
people to be involved and
excited? It's more of a ‑‑ if

246
23:13:55,667 --> 23:14:01,250
you're excited and engaged it's
a win. It's not how many people
are here it's how many of the

247
23:14:01,250 --> 23:14:06,750
right people that get it are
here. You know? Because that's
sort of our mission. So I don't

248
23:14:06,750 --> 23:14:10,458
get too worried about the
numbers ‑‑ there's plenty of
shows to go to but this happens

249
23:14:10,458 --> 23:14:16,458
to be the one we run and we're
focused to get the right people.
I'm amazed you got up some

250
23:14:21,333 --> 23:14:27,333
early, I got up a little later
than you. Maybe I was up a
little later too. I'm not sure.

251
23:14:31,083 --> 23:14:37,083
But I know there's no sleep till
Brooklyn tonight. I mean
we're ‑‑ >> By the way ‑‑ yeah,

252
23:14:40,500 --> 23:14:47,958
please. [Applause]. One more
time thank you Jeff. Twenty‑two
years. Thank you. [Applause].

253
23:14:47,958 --> 23:14:53,958
And I can tell you in working
with Jeff he's not just blowing
smoke. He really does take your

254
23:15:00,500 --> 23:15:06,958
feedback to heart and and thinks
about it and stresses over it.
If you do have legit feedback,

255
23:15:06,958 --> 23:15:12,417
this is not one of those where
you go to /dev/null with your
emails and all that. He really

256
23:15:12,417 --> 23:15:18,417
does go through the comments. >>
The reason you see all this text
at the bottom of the screen is

257
23:15:22,458 --> 23:15:28,375
we give away all of our content
for free as fast as we can and
sometimes it takes a while. A

258
23:15:28,375 --> 23:15:34,375
professor in the one of the UC
California systems says is it
okay if I use these 5 videos I

259
23:15:36,708 --> 23:15:40,917
use them for teaching. I said
sure you can take it for
whatever you want. The

23:15:46,000 --> 23:15:51,333

However I say that. He said

262
23:15:51,333 --> 23:15:57,333
that's great but in California
next year I can't show to my
students anything without

263
23:15:59,417 --> 23:16:05,417
subtitles. New law in
California. I said that sucks.
All my content is no longer

264
23:16:08,042 --> 23:16:12,208
going to be available? If
California does it everybody
else does it and now teachers

265
23:16:12,208 --> 23:16:18,167
across the country and our
countries aren't going to use
DEF CON talks. That's no fun.

266
23:16:18,167 --> 23:16:24,125
And so I better figure out how
to get text. And that runs into
this huge adventure how to get

267
23:16:24,125 --> 23:16:30,125
subtitling. So that's time
consuming and expensive. But it
is so cool because now it's

268
23:16:32,583 --> 23:16:38,958
translated on YouTube into other
languages. You find people in
Japan and Mexico translating it

269
23:16:38,958 --> 23:16:45,458
into Spanish and Portuguese and
so all of a sudden now we're
reaching a global audience just

270
23:16:45,458 --> 23:16:51,167
because one professor said it's
going to be a problem for me
next year. So that's the cool ‑‑

271
23:16:51,167 --> 23:16:57,167
[Applause]. >> Questions? What
do you want to ask? This is the
time. Do it. >> [Off mic] >> So

272
23:17:15,417 --> 23:17:19,458
why was the TOR talk cancelled?
I don't think I want to say
anything you didn't read in the

273
23:17:19,458 --> 23:17:24,375
newspaper. Nobody has actually
talked to those guys. They're
like totally quiet. But the

274
23:17:24,375 --> 23:17:30,375
rumor mill or in the
intelligence committee they say
the RUMINT was there was a break

275
23:17:34,375 --> 23:17:42,208
down in communication between
them and the University and and
somehow they got ahead of

276
23:17:42,208 --> 23:17:48,042
themselves and didn't follow all
the publication guidelines of
the University and that created

277
23:17:48,042 --> 23:17:53,875
drama internally. It wasn't the
NSA bringing down the hammer
like it was reported in some

278
23:17:53,875 --> 23:17:58,708
newspaper. It was great drama
and headlines to read but from
what I can tell that's not what

279
23:17:58,708 --> 23:18:05,833
happened. Half of the stuff is
fiction if you read about it. >>
How many of you didn't come

280
23:18:05,833 --> 23:18:11,833
because DEF CON was canceled?
>>I want to comment on that.
It's a long running tradition

281
23:18:13,958 --> 23:18:19,875
that DEF CON is canceled..
If you put on your red glasses
and look at the Welcome Banner,

282
23:18:19,875 --> 23:18:26,583
it actually says DEF CON is
canceled as you're walking into
DEF CON. So some of you may have

283
23:18:26,583 --> 23:18:32,583
seen a tweet that went out of a
resignation letter from Jeff. It
was well written and people said

284
23:18:39,625 --> 23:18:45,625
I will miss Jeff. All have to
say is, Read the freaking
domain. Since when do we put

285
23:18:50,292 --> 23:18:57,333
anything out on dot WS site?
Really? That kind of thing we
take it in strides and encourage

286
23:18:57,333 --> 23:19:04,583
it. Jeff was talking about no
sponsorship and not worrying
about the numbers. We try to

287
23:19:04,583 --> 23:19:12,458
talk people out of coming to the
conference to make them think it
is canceled through legitimate

288
23:19:12,458 --> 23:19:18,458
channels. That's just how we
play here. >> You have any other
questions? The question was

289
23:19:24,833 --> 23:19:30,833
registration faster please? I'm
sorry about that. I don't know
what happened. I mean DEF CON 20

290
23:19:35,042 --> 23:19:39,708
our 20th anniversary we knew
there would be a lot of people.
We knew there were going to be

291
23:19:39,708 --> 23:19:45,708
lines but not hopefully too
long. Since there every year we
add registration staff and

292
23:19:48,083 --> 23:19:53,083
normally there's a surge on
Thursday and it goes for a while
then people come over and people

293
23:19:53,083 --> 23:19:57,000
drive in from LA and Friday
people get off work and there's
patterns to when people show up.

294
23:19:57,000 --> 23:20:03,000
Not yesterday. Everybody showed
up in the same 4 hours. Like
where did you come from? Black

295
23:20:06,083 --> 23:20:11,042
Hat is still running. There's
7,000 people down the street. >>
They human DDOSed us. >> Yeah, a

296
23:20:11,042 --> 23:20:16,833
human DDOS. [applause] >>So in
theory, you guys have owned
DEFCON. >>Sorry about that but

297
23:20:16,833 --> 23:20:20,708
something changed this year and
now your pattern is everybody
all at once start at the

298
23:20:20,708 --> 23:20:24,583
beginning. >> [Off mic] >> We
have more ‑‑ we love them. We
call them the reg‑grannies.

299
23:20:24,583 --> 23:20:28,458
There's a contingent of people
in the Vegas area looking for
work and they're nice and

300
23:20:28,458 --> 23:20:32,833
retired so we hire a batch of
them every year that hand out
the badges. They're really cool

301
23:20:32,833 --> 23:20:36,708
to work with and every year we
increase and increase and
increase and now we physically

302
23:20:36,708 --> 23:20:42,417
have ran out of space to add
them. Ha ha. Registration
village. But you have to have a

303
23:20:42,417 --> 23:20:48,417
badge to get in. So the badge
situation you don't care because
you have a badge but for

304
23:20:50,500 --> 23:20:57,708
everybody that doesn't ‑‑ we're
not making more badges just
because it's a big giant pain to

305
23:20:57,708 --> 23:21:03,083
get ‑‑ everything is done in
quantity and you get lead times
and everything so we can't just

306
23:21:03,083 --> 23:21:08,458
do another small run of badges.
If we wanted to do them again we
would have to do them in the

307
23:21:08,458 --> 23:21:11,375
thousands. I over estimated.
There's a reason why we have
over a thousand DEF CON 20

308
23:21:11,375 --> 23:21:14,292
badges laying around. Because
people were saying you're going
to have 15,000 people. I bet you

309
23:21:14,292 --> 23:21:17,750
will have 20,000 people. We were
terrified. So we went out and
bought a sh- ton of badges. Like

310
23:21:17,750 --> 23:21:21,625
at one point I'll say the number
but I had $68,000 of badges left
over. I'm like, huh, what am I

311
23:21:21,625 --> 23:21:25,083
going to do with those? Give
them away or get universities to
hack on them. We gave some away

312
23:21:25,083 --> 23:21:28,375
to hacking spaces and did
whatever we could with them but
not a bad situation this year to

313
23:21:28,375 --> 23:21:31,667
be able to give away badges we
have laying in inventory that
have the same processor to do

314
23:21:31,667 --> 23:21:35,125
the exact same thing and that
was not by design. No that was
by design. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah it

315
23:21:35,125 --> 23:21:38,250
is. That's just how it works. So
the problem is somebody on
Twitter said that sucks. How

316
23:21:38,250 --> 23:21:41,542
can't you can't manage this.
It's like we stress out for so
long. But did you notice you

317
23:21:41,542 --> 23:21:45,250
paid cash? We don't do
preregistration for a reason. We
don't want to be an attractive

318
23:21:45,250 --> 23:21:47,375
target to subpoenas. So how do I
order the right number of
badges? And if you can figure

319
23:21:47,375 --> 23:21:49,625
that out it's sort of like the
Net Flix challenge. If you can
optimize my movie rentals by a

320
23:21:49,625 --> 23:21:51,667
percent it's worth a lot of
money because I have not enough
badges or thousands too many.

321
23:21:51,667 --> 23:21:53,667
Take bit coins? Yeah, you
fuckers are going to hack that
stuff. Then I'm going to be

322
23:21:53,667 --> 23:21:55,667
broke then the day after I'm
broke, you will be rich. And
it's going to be

323
23:21:55,667 --> 23:21:57,667
like... So... Anyway... So yeah
it's not like we're just asleep
at the wheel. There's some hard

324
23:21:57,667 --> 23:21:59,667
problems left like how to get
you all the content, how to get
you all registered but we're

325
23:21:59,667 --> 23:22:02,875
working on it. Everybody is
pretty forgiving. When you
explaining I try to be

326
23:22:02,875 --> 23:22:08,875
transparent about everything.
You don't need to know about the
background drama like why that

327
23:22:28,000 --> 23:22:35,000
screen not as wide as it should
be. But I try to be really ‑‑
but I try to be as transparent

328
23:22:35,000 --> 23:22:39,875
as possible and I think people
respond to that so that's one of
our ‑‑ that's one of the things

329
23:22:39,875 --> 23:22:44,500
at DEF CON. We figure you're
adult enough to make your own
decision so we will tell what

330
23:22:44,500 --> 23:22:49,542
you it is and if you don't like
come up with a different
conclusion and good for you. So

331
23:22:49,542 --> 23:22:55,917
we want to close it out get
ready for the next talk and
everything but I want to really,

332
23:22:55,917 --> 23:23:03,792
really ‑‑ I'm not shiting you. I
really am happy you're here and
want to welcome you and if you

333
23:23:03,792 --> 23:23:10,042
have any questions just ask.
Because people love teaching and
that's where we're about so

334
23:23:10,042 --> 23:23:16,208
cool. Have a good time. Come to
the parties tonight and come to
the movie screenings. Thanks a

335
23:23:16,208 --> 23:23:20,792
lot. [Applause].
