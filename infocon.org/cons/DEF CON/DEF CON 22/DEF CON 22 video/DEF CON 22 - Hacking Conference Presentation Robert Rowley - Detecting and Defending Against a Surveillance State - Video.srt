1
00:00:00,125 --> 00:00:07,750
We have Robert Rowley who is
a ‑‑ he works for what I
understand is Trustwave in their

2
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:12,500
Spiderlabs division, is that
right? I don't want to get
anybody in trouble here. He's

3
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:17,333
going to talk and he's going to
talk about detecting and
defending against State-Actor

4
00:00:17,333 --> 00:00:23,042
surveillance as we all know
certainly in the past couple of
years we all know for sure that

5
00:00:23,042 --> 00:00:27,917
the state is as much a threat as
a lot of the other threats that
are out there. Let's give a big

6
00:00:27,917 --> 00:00:33,917
party track welcome to Robert! [
Cheers and applause ] >> Thank
you all for showing up at this

7
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:47,500
1:00, I'm sure you have just
woken up. Turn on my notes.
Definitely thank you for

8
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:55,208
choosing the presentation. I'm
going to talk about deteching
the surveillance tools that

9
00:00:55,208 --> 00:01:00,542
State-Actor Surveillance groups
are using, an extension of
series of blog posts that I

10
00:01:00,542 --> 00:01:06,667
posted earlier this year to the
Spiderlabs blog.
Blog.spiderlabs.com it details

11
00:01:06,667 --> 00:01:12,125
how to detect and defend against
the State-Actor Surveillance
tools that were released earlier

12
00:01:12,125 --> 00:01:19,958
or uh, late last year, 2013.
Foremost is who is this guy, I'm
Robert Rowley, my day job is

13
00:01:19,958 --> 00:01:25,917
working at the security research
for Trustwave. I work in the
Spiderlabs division, Spiderlabs

14
00:01:25,917 --> 00:01:31,792
department. I specifically do
vulnerability assessment, that
is not really what... there's

15
00:01:31,792 --> 00:01:36,000
not a lot of cross over between
what this talk is about and my
actual day job. I pretty much

16
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:43,625
write ruby code. Not specific to
the work that I do but a great
example of the organization that

17
00:01:43,625 --> 00:01:49,083
I work for and how they allow me
to kind of ‑‑ basically run on
my own, do my own independent

18
00:01:49,083 --> 00:01:56,250
research let me have their name
on these slides which is really
quite amazing. I'm part of the

19
00:01:56,250 --> 00:02:00,417
southern California hacker
scene, I've been going to DEF
CON since DEFCON 9. I've been

20
00:02:00,417 --> 00:02:06,708
part of the California hacker
scene for ten‑plus years, I feel
very old. But I really started

21
00:02:06,708 --> 00:02:14,333
doing this when I was 14 and 15
years old choosing a Linux
computer instead of a car. [

22
00:02:14,333 --> 00:02:19,542
Applause ] Thank you. I was
stuck at home a lot I got a lot
of walking in. You can hit me up

23
00:02:19,542 --> 00:02:25,542
on Twitter @Ianli you can
#harassme all you want, I don't
care. You can during, after,

24
00:02:33,083 --> 00:02:39,042
whatever. Again back to me, I
was identified security research
is my former title, years and

25
00:02:39,042 --> 00:02:44,333
years ago it was somebody else
told me I was security
researcher after fun shenanigans

26
00:02:44,333 --> 00:02:47,500
I had at DEF CON. Where I am
actually the guy who is
responsible for that free

27
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:51,625
cellphone charging kiosk at the
wall of sheep. So if anybody's
battery is dead please feel free

28
00:02:51,625 --> 00:02:56,458
to go to the wall of sheep and
charge your phone for free, I
swear it's all on the up and up.

29
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:03,000
On a good note, I probably
because that have charging
station I'm probably the reason

30
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,583
why the paid charging station
that was also here at the Rio
the first year, I'm probably the

31
00:03:07,583 --> 00:03:13,583
reason why that thing is gone. I
don't think it lasted the
weekend. I've been giving a lot

32
00:03:16,708 --> 00:03:23,083
of presentations from talks
about cell phone stuff, some web
stuff, a lot of crazy stuff this

33
00:03:23,083 --> 00:03:28,583
is completely different, this is
kind of tie in to some kind of
pseudoactivism that I have been

34
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:33,083
associated with. I've given talk
to activists groups, like
Restore the 4th, down in

35
00:03:33,083 --> 00:03:39,875
southern California. I like what
they do, they do things that I
can't do. But I can't do alone.

36
00:03:39,875 --> 00:03:46,708
I care a lot about privacy it
has always been one of my own
personal concerns and especially

37
00:03:46,708 --> 00:03:51,167
after what happened about a year
or so that definitely escalated.
I've been interested in privacy

38
00:03:51,167 --> 00:03:58,667
for four or five years. Goes
back to about ten years I'll get
in to that story. But before ‑‑

39
00:03:58,667 --> 00:04:04,667
always good. I should also take
note, everybody here, I have a
thing I don't like hearsay.

40
00:04:07,583 --> 00:04:12,167
Hearsay is a story with no
tangible evidence. Something
that you've heard from a third

41
00:04:12,167 --> 00:04:16,083
party or heard from a second
party or feel like happened but
you don't have any tangible

42
00:04:16,083 --> 00:04:22,375
evidence to back up your story.
I really loathe how that is, I
do appreciate somebody who can

43
00:04:22,375 --> 00:04:26,958
show me evidence as opposed to
somebody who says, this is how
it is, is this is how I think it

44
00:04:26,958 --> 00:04:33,458
is. There is a lot going wrong,
mostly not necessarily this
community so much and DEF CON

45
00:04:33,458 --> 00:04:39,167
hacking technical oriented
people with the logical minds
that we know how things add up

46
00:04:39,167 --> 00:04:42,542
and how things work. But I see a
lot in the activists groups,
especially L.A., southern

47
00:04:42,542 --> 00:04:49,292
California area where there is a
lot of well this is how I feel
things happened. I really feel

48
00:04:49,292 --> 00:04:55,250
sad. But going on to this
talk I'm going to cover a couple
categories on this surveillance

49
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:59,000
talk in the introduction
already. I am going to give a
quick introduction of things,

50
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:04,583
explain some things kind of give
a back story on some things that
I go into the talk about the

51
00:05:04,583 --> 00:05:08,167
detailed information and
surveillance catalog leaks which
is what I'm calling it. It's the

52
00:05:08,167 --> 00:05:15,792
TAO release from alleged NSA top
secret documents. For anybody
here who has security clearance

53
00:05:15,792 --> 00:05:19,375
may be worried about me leaking
the security clearance
information, I have it covered.

54
00:05:19,375 --> 00:05:24,667
I'll explain that, no worry you
will not have any risk of seeing
any top secret documents

55
00:05:24,667 --> 00:05:30,667
released here. Basically the
documents were released last
year in 2013 by researcher

56
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:41,042
journalist who explained how
everything was. I looked in to
them and I'll get in to more

57
00:05:41,042 --> 00:05:46,083
specifics. After released I
started writing up a blog post
that's how I felt nobody was

58
00:05:46,083 --> 00:05:51,042
looking at it as let's find
evidence for this. I wanted to
give people information on how

59
00:05:51,042 --> 00:05:56,917
you find that evidence, how you
detect against them so you know
you are or are not being spied

60
00:05:56,917 --> 00:06:03,917
upon. The focus on the talk is
to detect how to find tangible
evidence. This talk is not

61
00:06:03,917 --> 00:06:08,667
pedaling snake oil which is key.
Not trying to sell you a service
or anything like that or by you

62
00:06:08,667 --> 00:06:15,500
a safety net from evil aliens,
illuminati, or the owl farm, or
any other controllers of the

63
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:22,542
universe, anybody reading your
minds, not trying to protect
from you those guys. You need to

64
00:06:22,542 --> 00:06:28,542
seek out psychotherapy. Who is
involved in this matter.
Surveillance, you're looking at

65
00:06:30,917 --> 00:06:35,250
what people are doing, people
don't feel good, there are spies
and those that are spies

66
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:40,667
upon.Simple. Spies can spy on
other spies. But there are two
factors in this matter. Somebody

67
00:06:40,667 --> 00:06:46,833
is either listening in or
somebody being listened to.
People gather intelligence they

68
00:06:46,833 --> 00:06:51,042
spy on other agencies that
gathering intelligence or how
they use the intelligence and

69
00:06:51,042 --> 00:06:55,625
the information that they're
gathering for good or evil.
Remember, folks, it's he who

70
00:06:55,625 --> 00:07:02,708
that writes the history books.
I've been spied upon in my life,
this is where the core of my

71
00:07:02,708 --> 00:07:08,708
ideals and activism work, I
believe it was... I like to call
it scare and care, in 2001‑2002

72
00:07:12,042 --> 00:07:18,000
right after certain events in
this country that allowed the
agency that was doing the spying

73
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,958
to look in to everything that I
was doing at the time and I was
aware of this because they

74
00:07:21,958 --> 00:07:26,750
weren't really good at what they
were doing at that time. They
came up to my house, they asked

75
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:32,208
for the name on the DSL bill
which was my grandmother, I was
living at my grandmother's

76
00:07:32,208 --> 00:07:36,542
house. They assumed that she was
the individual who was
responsible for all this

77
00:07:36,542 --> 00:07:44,000
activity on the network so they
sat down with her, in the living
room with their guns on their

78
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,875
side, just nice, happy, well
dressed agents. They had guns on
them and they sat down with my

79
00:07:49,875 --> 00:07:55,500
grandmother and they talked with
her for 15, 20 minutes, probably
only five minutes. I wasn't

80
00:07:55,500 --> 00:08:00,375
around for that. But they saw a
laptop on her dining room table
they just assumed it was her

81
00:08:00,375 --> 00:08:07,875
laptop that I bought her to play
Solitare. So she didn't have to
shuffle. Then I heard my grandma

82
00:08:07,875 --> 00:08:14,417
call. I came out said, hello.
They said, oh, it's you that
we're looking for. 18‑year‑old

83
00:08:14,417 --> 00:08:20,417
me. Eventually those agents... I
hope if he's here, I'd love to
talk to you if you remember that

84
00:08:24,375 --> 00:08:30,375
story, you remember who I am.
It's all about who spies, where
do spies spy they can spy for

85
00:08:32,917 --> 00:08:39,083
good or evil. It's what they do
with it. In reality they spy,
it's a job. They justify their

86
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:45,250
actions for greater good or for
better words it's what their
duty is, if they don't spy right

87
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:49,417
or enough, it is their job, they
lose their money, house, family,
not necessarily good just

88
00:08:49,417 --> 00:08:55,417
whether or not they have
morality of their own soul to
say, this is wrong. And tell

89
00:08:57,708 --> 00:09:04,625
people how it's wrong or refuse
to do that work. Find other
work. My previous slide, it's

90
00:09:04,625 --> 00:09:12,250
about he who wins wars writes
the history books. Allen Toring
is good example, somebody who

91
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:17,583
did a great thing and he was
breaking encryption. He was
spying on what was the access

92
00:09:17,583 --> 00:09:24,458
powers and using his knowledge
to break their encryption
protocols to be able to listen

93
00:09:24,458 --> 00:09:29,375
to their stuff. He did bad if
you look at it from the access
point of view, he did great, if

94
00:09:29,375 --> 00:09:36,458
you look at it from the allied
point of view. Allies won World
War II. Post war we all know how

95
00:09:36,458 --> 00:09:44,000
he was treated and we know how
that works, again, when you're
valuable you're invaluable and

96
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,250
when you're no longer valuable,
they'll treat you just like you
were originally. History is

97
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:52,458
always being written though,
we're at a very interesting time
right now. There are lot of

98
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:57,167
current efforts going on, who
all knows what's going on right
now? Is surveillance state fear

99
00:09:57,167 --> 00:10:04,708
a new thing for anybody here? 	I
highly recommend actually
looking back to the '70s most of

100
00:10:04,708 --> 00:10:08,833
the stuff that we see today is
just a repeat of exactly... many
similar things back in the 1970s

101
00:10:08,833 --> 00:10:15,458
which is when there was a great
overhaul in privacy laws in the
United States. But look back I'm

102
00:10:15,458 --> 00:10:21,458
not going to dwell too much on
that. Full disclosure. Again,
both tin foil hat wearers.

103
00:10:23,583 --> 00:10:29,333
People come up to me with crazy
whimsical stories after I've
given similar talks and they

104
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:34,000
talk about how the Illuminati
came in and they black bagged
their girlfriend, hint‑hint

105
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:41,167
she's just not returning your
calls. (Laughter) 	I can't help
you if you don't have physical

106
00:10:41,167 --> 00:10:45,750
evidence, in fact, frankly, I'm
not really interested unless you
have physical evidence. I'm very

107
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:49,458
interested if you have physical
evidence you can show me
something happening. To date

108
00:10:49,458 --> 00:10:53,667
nobody has come forward based on
these links and actually shown
physical evidence of one of

109
00:10:53,667 --> 00:11:01,125
these existing or having been
found. There's a story here, in
2010 well before this

110
00:11:01,125 --> 00:11:07,833
information was released, there
was an individual who did write
up story, they contacted

111
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:14,375
wired.com one of the publishers
published a story found a GPS
tracking device in their car.

112
00:11:14,375 --> 00:11:19,583
This has happened. Not a leak
that we're talking about. This
information is out there you can

113
00:11:19,583 --> 00:11:24,417
probably find it if you look.
You just have to know if you see
something that doesn't belong,

114
00:11:24,417 --> 00:11:30,208
unplug it see if a black SUV
shows up and some guys in suits
try to talk to you. Only major

115
00:11:30,208 --> 00:11:35,792
story that I found, I'm familiar
with it because it was from
southern California which is

116
00:11:35,792 --> 00:11:41,792
where I'm from. It's basically
the only thing that has evidence
that I was aware of, obviously

117
00:11:43,917 --> 00:11:49,167
nobody accepts or admits any
involvement to it that's when
you can expect in the end what

118
00:11:49,167 --> 00:11:53,333
happened was there was actually
a wired article in something
tangible was presented and

119
00:11:53,333 --> 00:11:59,333
discussed in a public arena.
Getting to the beef now. What is
the surveillance catalog.

120
00:12:01,792 --> 00:12:06,958
Something written up by
presenter, journalist,
researcher, 30C3 released, it

121
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:11,833
was released in Der Spiegel, as
well as during that conference
at the same time run around just

122
00:12:11,833 --> 00:12:17,833
like Christmas 2013.
Surveillance catalog, lots of
details on how they worked kind

123
00:12:21,167 --> 00:12:27,167
of an idea. There's a lot of
missing components, but what is
most interesting was, a lot of

124
00:12:27,167 --> 00:12:33,417
people alluded to assume what
the source was Snowden but the
source, the leak information was

125
00:12:33,417 --> 00:12:37,792
actually the source was never
credited. It's unknown if it was
directly related to Edward

126
00:12:37,792 --> 00:12:43,708
Snowden leaks but I can tell you
that from my knowledge of which
reporters in news agencies have

127
00:12:43,708 --> 00:12:48,417
released information about
Snowden first, Der Spiegal
wasn't on that list. Possibly

128
00:12:48,417 --> 00:12:53,875
never had the actual copy of
Snowden's leaks nor would they
be going forward with this

129
00:12:53,875 --> 00:12:58,750
information while others were
ignoring it. You can consider
that, there's been a lot of talk

130
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:03,792
about this considering the
second leaker, I don't know
really what it is, either second

131
00:13:03,792 --> 00:13:09,542
leaker there is information they
had from perhaps a Wikileaks
type source we know there is

132
00:13:09,542 --> 00:13:13,083
connection with the research
involved with it. And Wikileaks,
basically not necessarily

133
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:19,083
Snowden a lot of people like to
say Snowden, it could be second
shooter or leaker, there on the

134
00:13:21,208 --> 00:13:26,125
grassy noll or through
Wikileaks. Let the conspiracy
theories begin, please keep them

135
00:13:26,125 --> 00:13:31,125
away from me. This is what I
promised earlier, I'm
introducing a character called

136
00:13:31,125 --> 00:13:37,708
surveillance Sam. This is
helping me avoid showing secret
documents during the talk. It's

137
00:13:37,708 --> 00:13:43,583
also because when I thought
about how do I show the images,
I don't have copywrite for

138
00:13:43,583 --> 00:13:48,667
because they are top secret
documents, I didn't know if I
could all the NSA and say "Hey,

139
00:13:48,667 --> 00:13:56,083
can I use these in my slides?" I
just kind of assumed what their
answer would be so, appropriate

140
00:13:56,083 --> 00:14:00,125
action, created my own
character. I think more people
should be doing this. Copywrite

141
00:14:00,125 --> 00:14:05,292
free, everybody can have them, I
have stickers up here as well
and there's a vendor in the

142
00:14:05,292 --> 00:14:11,917
vendor area also has stickers
available. Come see me.
Obviously comes with my special

143
00:14:11,917 --> 00:14:17,917
limited black helicopter and
anti‑whistle blower karate chop
action. Thanks for listening to

144
00:14:21,042 --> 00:14:26,542
my Schpeel. Let's get into some
actual details. We're going to
start with four sections we'll

145
00:14:26,542 --> 00:14:30,042
start off with Hardware Bugs.
After each section feel free,if
you have a question, raise your

146
00:14:30,042 --> 00:14:34,875
hand, come to the podium, hoot
and whistle, try to figure me
out so I don't want to jump back

147
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:42,667
if anybody has specific
questions. First, again the
first introduction is this is a

148
00:14:42,667 --> 00:14:48,500
series of hardware bugs, these
are all Retro Reflectors. Rage
master is a bug that attacks to

149
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:55,292
your VGA cable typically on the
red data feed. It is used to
transmit the data from your VGA

150
00:14:55,292 --> 00:15:01,167
red feed to a remote source to
see what is on your screen. Loud
Auto is basically an embedded

151
00:15:01,167 --> 00:15:06,250
microphone system. These have
existed since the 60's well
before the mention of other

152
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:12,042
microphones that RSA signal
starts transmitting what it
hears in the room. Tawdryyard is

153
00:15:12,042 --> 00:15:18,375
a radio beacon, kind of think of
this RFID on crack they can
track down where physical device

154
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:26,042
is maybe laptop or phone, can
use radio beacons to try to find
out where you are. Surlyspawn,

155
00:15:26,042 --> 00:15:32,542
similar to the rage master
system that is embedded in line
with your keyboard now and they

156
00:15:32,542 --> 00:15:39,750
transmit an RF signal to turn it
on, it starts transmitting what
you're typing on your keyboard.

157
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:45,000
Basic ideas here, very simple
they all collect information
send it over the RF frequencies,

158
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:50,292
radio frequencies. Obviously we
know how to fix this by wearing
tin foil hat. You can go call

159
00:15:50,292 --> 00:15:56,250
EFF get limited edition hat. By
the way not sponsored, not real,
that was a joke. It wouldn't

160
00:15:56,250 --> 00:16:01,375
detect anything, And again that
is not the point of this talk so
please don't actually think tin

161
00:16:01,375 --> 00:16:04,625
foiling up your stuff will tell
you if someone was spying on
you. It's a good thing as a

162
00:16:04,625 --> 00:16:08,583
detterant but it won't tell you
if somebody was doing anything.
you'll be running around with a

163
00:16:08,583 --> 00:16:15,958
non‑stylish hat. Unless somebody
figures that out and makes it
cool. You can ‑‑ this tracks

164
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:21,208
back to what I mentioned before
with juice jacking. With
malicious cell phone kiosks

165
00:16:21,208 --> 00:16:25,875
something that I did awhile ago
it's gained a lot of popularity,
it's been back in the news

166
00:16:25,875 --> 00:16:30,000
recently. Just coincidentally
people were releasing these
items called USB condoms. Where

167
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:37,792
it removes the data lines from
your USB port so that you can
charge freely. Again this is a

168
00:16:37,792 --> 00:16:42,958
problem that I feel prevent
something but it doesn't tell
you that somebody was actually

169
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:48,458
trying to get data off of your
phone. Surprisingly enough there
is a solution for that called

170
00:16:48,458 --> 00:16:53,792
plugging your phone in, it's
kind of scary, but when you plug
your phone in most phones,

171
00:16:53,792 --> 00:16:57,292
Android phones, iPhones will
tell you if it's trying to
negotiate with a computer and if

172
00:16:57,292 --> 00:17:01,500
you want to access it and that
is point in time, perhaps plug
in a burner phone you're not

173
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:05,958
afraid to lose or plug in
another device. Then that's
point in time where the hell is

174
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:10,792
there a CPO on the other end of
this charging station. That's
far more valuable to know than

175
00:17:10,792 --> 00:17:18,333
running around with a little USB
condom assuming every charging
USB port is out to get you. For

176
00:17:18,333 --> 00:17:22,917
these bugs, the correct answer
would be using a radio,
something like the hacker F

177
00:17:22,917 --> 00:17:25,750
board, software defined radio is
great thing in recent years
instead of buying $10,000,

178
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:30,417
$30,000, or $100,000 piece ever
gear listen to radio spectrums
you buy small board, I don't

179
00:17:30,417 --> 00:17:36,417
know how much they go for only
few hundred bucks if that. You
write software for them it will

180
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:48,667
listen in to the spectrums that
you're trying to listen in on.
You sit there you can figure out

181
00:17:48,667 --> 00:17:54,292
what the ambient radio noise in
any room or office is simply
listen for spikes or changes.

182
00:17:54,292 --> 00:17:59,958
When you see spikes or changes,
perhaps it was associated when
you were typing in the keyboard

183
00:17:59,958 --> 00:18:04,292
or when you had a computer on
and now you can start ruling out
things find out what the hell is

184
00:18:04,292 --> 00:18:10,917
going on. I was asked by a
reporter if I had any like
software that I was releasing

185
00:18:10,917 --> 00:18:15,875
for this or a tool to detect
surveillance states, I have to
clarify because nobody has come

186
00:18:15,875 --> 00:18:23,083
forward with an actual tangible
here's what the NSA or CIA or
any other group is actually

187
00:18:23,083 --> 00:18:28,125
using, it would be inappropriate
to design detection tool because
simply enough you wouldn't know

188
00:18:28,125 --> 00:18:30,833
what frequencies they're
listening on and it's either
going a false positive or never

189
00:18:30,833 --> 00:18:37,833
detected at all and then I'd be
selling snake oil which is not
what I want to do. Which I guess

190
00:18:37,833 --> 00:18:45,000
shout out does go to the group
who in your DEF CON schedule see
NSA talks, all those guys are

191
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:50,875
designing what the open source
alternative to the surveillance
tools would be it's very

192
00:18:50,875 --> 00:18:55,458
interesting. Go find those talks
and perhaps then you can be the
one that creates the detection

193
00:18:55,458 --> 00:19:03,125
tools just for the fun of it, it
won't work in real life you can
assume or not using ‑‑ maybe not

194
00:19:03,125 --> 00:19:08,500
using open source ones or maybe
surveillance or NSA just doing
them a favor. To be funny.

195
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:16,250
Moving on. Another way for
hardware bugs to work, data
exfiltration methods or embedded

196
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:22,250
compromising devices for cotton
mouth this is USB bug, it embeds
in your USB hub or USB device or

197
00:19:24,583 --> 00:19:30,583
cable and USB injections over an
air gap. It starts sending USB
attacks onto a USB system. Ginsu

198
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:42,500
which is PCI bus bug, those ‑‑
who here is familiar with IPMI?
10%. Basically IPMI is a control

199
00:19:47,417 --> 00:19:52,417
utility that plugs in to your
control utility bus and let's
you do anything to the box.

200
00:19:52,417 --> 00:19:59,583
Remotely administer the box by
plugging in this PCI card.
That's basically what Ginsu is.

201
00:19:59,583 --> 00:20:07,000
It's tailored for surveillance
usage. Howlermonkey, which is a
series of RF transmitters

202
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:13,000
basically simply explain what
they do, howler monkey transmits
RF or other utilities. Fire walk

203
00:20:15,083 --> 00:20:20,292
is Ethernet bug it can inject or
monitor traffic, basically
packets, if it were a packet

204
00:20:20,292 --> 00:20:26,292
injector. For these... or any of
these devices which connect to
JTAG which is Godsurge, which is

205
00:20:28,667 --> 00:20:35,000
a Bios attack system, compact
flashcards, star montana
systems. They all mean basically

206
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:40,708
it's a most odd of persistent
compromise following a device.
Attack the BIOS, the

207
00:20:40,708 --> 00:20:45,083
peripherals, that is what all
these devices are they share one
thing in common they can be

208
00:20:45,083 --> 00:20:50,250
found if you look for them. If
you look in the system and you
see surveillance Sam you know

209
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:55,500
something is wrong, means your
kid has gotten in to your
computer. More importantly if

210
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:59,500
you look in to a system you see
a PCI card that perhaps you
don't know what it does, why

211
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:06,250
it's plugged in, you unplug it
and a Black SUV again shows up
an hour later then you know you

212
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:11,375
have something going on. Or if
nothing breaks perhaps you just
want to leave it unplugged not

213
00:21:11,375 --> 00:21:16,417
try to worry. Some of these
systems plug in to JTAG headers
which surveillance Sam is

214
00:21:16,417 --> 00:21:23,208
inspecting right below. JTAG
headers are headers that... they
are leads that go in to CPU.

215
00:21:23,208 --> 00:21:30,083
They are intended usage on
mostly embedded systems. Also
Godsurge which was in the NSAor,

216
00:21:30,083 --> 00:21:35,583
the TOA catalog in which is
targeting a server on certain
vendor which I probably

217
00:21:35,583 --> 00:21:38,000
shouldn't name to keep my job.
	But the idea that simply enough
they have leads that lead... it

218
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:47,417
left it exposed on the board
which they shipped out which is
very common thing for any vendor

219
00:21:47,417 --> 00:21:53,917
to do. It's used during
debugging and development...
during the debugging and

220
00:21:53,917 --> 00:21:59,417
development process. Allows to
you get to the CPU to find out
what was wrong, way easier to do

221
00:21:59,417 --> 00:22:03,250
it that way especially for
embedded devices that have no
monitors or keyboard inputs. You

222
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:07,958
just plug it into the JTAG port
its like a serial interface
directly to the CPU pretty

223
00:22:07,958 --> 00:22:13,958
much is, it's ... trying to
think of the right expletive to
use. Fill in the blank. 	The key

224
00:22:17,292 --> 00:22:21,167
detecting anything like this you
assume perhaps I'll never be
able to detect anything embedded

225
00:22:21,167 --> 00:22:26,292
in the system that remember that
every vendor who ships a board
is going to have every single

226
00:22:26,292 --> 00:22:31,792
PCP trace on the board. They
aren't going to run cables over
the board to make connections

227
00:22:31,792 --> 00:22:35,125
because they didn't have
enough layers. Pretty much
everybody nowadays with the

228
00:22:35,125 --> 00:22:39,417
technology of the PCP creation,
they can make as many layers as
they want to pass the cost on to

229
00:22:39,417 --> 00:22:44,292
the consumer. This isn't the
1980s with the Apple 2 that you
had to build yourself in the

230
00:22:44,292 --> 00:22:48,833
garage. Nobody has exposed
leads, exposed wires, if you see
one on a computer, perhaps you

231
00:22:48,833 --> 00:22:54,667
want to look up the manager
specs that's connected to your
CPU or to JTAG or XTP or ITP

232
00:22:54,667 --> 00:23:00,125
header. That would be how you
find them. Again how you find
them simply looking for the

233
00:23:00,125 --> 00:23:07,292
thing that doesn't belong. If
you... what I have here is two
allergy pills and one laxative.

234
00:23:07,292 --> 00:23:13,500
Specifically they're children's
medicine. If you can't tell
what's wrong then perhaps you

235
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:20,625
shouldn't be a parent who may
accidentally give your sick
child the laxative pill which

236
00:23:20,625 --> 00:23:26,792
doubles your problems.
(Laughter) Move on to some
software compromises. The

237
00:23:26,792 --> 00:23:33,250
software exploits basically
attack firmware or BIOS. They
aren't an embedded device you

238
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:37,333
can't just open up a mother
board or your case and start
looking inside and creating the

239
00:23:37,333 --> 00:23:42,417
persisted compromise, which what
you would actually do... well
let me explain what they are.

240
00:23:42,417 --> 00:23:47,375
Iratemonk Swap are basically
master boot record or hard drive
firmware attacks. Interestingly

241
00:23:47,375 --> 00:23:52,125
enough in the last month, well
Master Boot record attacks
existed for years, hard drive

242
00:23:52,125 --> 00:23:58,750
firmware attacks have been
recently popularized at some
other conferences. Mother board

243
00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:06,667
BIOS attacks they rewrite your
BIOS there has been some talk
about malicious BIOS in the last

244
00:24:06,667 --> 00:24:13,375
year, simple ‑‑ what's
interesting that the way they
were detecting, I didn't see

245
00:24:13,375 --> 00:24:19,875
many people showing examples of
the BIOS where that is basically
what you want to start pulling

246
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:25,458
off the data from the chip, it's
very time consuming, it's very
tedious, the fast way to do it

247
00:24:25,458 --> 00:24:30,958
just re-flash the devices.
Unfortunately it's really not
going to tell you if there was

248
00:24:30,958 --> 00:24:36,042
anything malicious on the
device. Like I mentioned, the
only way to do it is by, pulling

249
00:24:36,042 --> 00:24:40,625
the firmware off of the device
from finding the way to pull the
BIOS off the device, every

250
00:24:40,625 --> 00:24:45,167
device is different. But pull
that data get a copy of the
firmware from the manufacturer

251
00:24:45,167 --> 00:24:49,708
try to talk to them see if it
was what you inspect to see then
do comparisons, if something

252
00:24:49,708 --> 00:24:53,917
comes up then now you know what
is ‑‑ now you know something
interesting going on you can

253
00:24:53,917 --> 00:25:00,333
start debugging it or
decompiling it. Nobody came
forward with any BIOS‑based

254
00:25:00,333 --> 00:25:04,833
malware found in the wild in the
last year or so that actually
explained in detail, said this

255
00:25:04,833 --> 00:25:10,792
is exactly where these attacks
are. Another way that saves it,
the problem with doing that is

256
00:25:10,792 --> 00:25:18,292
that really, really slow to pull
firmware off of the device about
900 mod or slower. It takes

257
00:25:18,292 --> 00:25:24,292
forever. With this day and age
from the Internet is gigabits
something that is measured in

258
00:25:24,292 --> 00:25:28,375
basically bits in baud rate is
very sad. There's platform
module in the system called TPM,

259
00:25:28,375 --> 00:25:34,375
trusted platform module, if
you're familiar with how they
work. Not many. Who here is

260
00:25:37,292 --> 00:25:45,000
familiar with how to hack them?
Even less. One guy over there.
Thank you. Somebody. I had

261
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:49,458
somebody yell at me last time I
gave something, last time I
mentioned TPM sat there shaking

262
00:25:49,458 --> 00:25:55,458
his head, disappointed as to
what I was talking about.
Reality is, let me explain

263
00:25:55,458 --> 00:25:58,667
:trust platform module is a chip
that cold crypto key, private
key and securely holds that key,

264
00:25:58,667 --> 00:26:06,167
so it can not be pulled off.
There are attacks against it and
tear apart the chip start

265
00:26:06,167 --> 00:26:10,250
pulling the data off the chip.
Be able to get the key but that
requires physical and

266
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:17,375
destruction actions. You'll know
when your chips are being
desaudered using acids and other

267
00:26:17,375 --> 00:26:25,083
gizmos. Somebody needs to borrow
your laptop is handing it back
to you wearing haz‑mat suit you

268
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:29,958
have something to be concerned
about. Gotten a lot of flack
from the security community

269
00:26:29,958 --> 00:26:34,958
mostly because manufacturers
enjoy using TPM to block down
hardware, be able to detect

270
00:26:34,958 --> 00:26:38,000
changes in hardware and your
device and hackers don't like
that because they want to

271
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:44,000
change things. We want to modify
stuff, want to not be punished
for doing that. What's funny is

272
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:54,083
the universe of this they want
to use, we can use TPM to detect
changes in devices, to detect

273
00:26:54,083 --> 00:26:59,792
changes in firmware is the
secured key that the ‑‑ any time
something changes or weaken

274
00:26:59,792 --> 00:27:05,417
that, something change, look in
to this. It doesn't
automatically, does it much

275
00:27:05,417 --> 00:27:11,417
faster than physically pulling
the device. Problem with it only
ever as good as its been

276
00:27:13,458 --> 00:27:18,750
implemented. Most manufacturers
do not implement TPM correctly
there are attacks against it and

277
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:23,792
you can see in this picture
which I took when I was out in
the desert sometimes people

278
00:27:23,792 --> 00:27:27,500
don't understand security they
think putting a lock on it
works. In this case it wasn't

279
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:33,500
work for shit I had to see what
was inside that shed, a lot of
rat poop. Think some paint cans.

280
00:27:37,125 --> 00:27:41,875
Let's talk a little bit
about WIFI. There are two
devices, who here has a Wi‑Fi

281
00:27:41,875 --> 00:27:47,875
pineapple? You have exactly what
this TAO playset was explaining
except for one of them is

282
00:27:50,292 --> 00:27:56,542
attached to UAB. Or in this case
special edition surveillance Sam
black helicopter. The night

283
00:27:56,542 --> 00:28:00,958
stand is effectively a Wi‑Fi
pineapple, nothing special.
Looked like it was a laptop in a

284
00:28:00,958 --> 00:28:08,333
case that looked like opened up
probably just has series of
Wi‑Fi based attacks that you can

285
00:28:08,333 --> 00:28:15,292
use. Sparrow was a simple small
form factor, Wi‑Fi device
attached to a drone, you would

286
00:28:15,292 --> 00:28:22,375
use all your same common sense
with Wi‑Fi attacks that existed
for the last 10, 15 years to be

287
00:28:22,375 --> 00:28:28,000
able to detect these devices
listening in on you or detecting
devices in your area. If you

288
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:32,667
have a Wi‑Fi pineapple it's a
good thing, if you don't know
what a Wi-Fi pineapple is you

289
00:28:32,667 --> 00:28:35,625
are probably going to be
compromised for these types of
attacks so just turn Wi‑Fi off

290
00:28:35,625 --> 00:28:41,333
unless you need it. There's not
much more I can say here not to
get in to too much details or

291
00:28:41,333 --> 00:28:47,625
about to spin off an entire talk
about Wi‑Fi based attacks I'm
just going to skip over it.

292
00:28:47,625 --> 00:28:54,167
Cellular networks is the final
section I think I'm going pretty
good pace, a little bit fast, if

293
00:28:54,167 --> 00:29:00,833
anybody has any questions again
feel free to let me know. I
worked in the final group where

294
00:29:00,833 --> 00:29:07,667
now making large jump from the
basic cargo‑based attacks. Cell
phone bugs, easy to say we all

295
00:29:07,667 --> 00:29:11,708
rely on cell phones and are very
familiar with people who rely on
cell phones especially with the

296
00:29:11,708 --> 00:29:18,917
work that did I before. Going to
push to detect and monitor for
the cell phones and cell phone

297
00:29:18,917 --> 00:29:25,792
networks just what they do. I
should say that I found out
sense of pride when the research

298
00:29:25,792 --> 00:29:32,292
that I did with malicious stuff
on a cell phone kiosk, actually
ended up in a government

299
00:29:32,292 --> 00:29:37,250
document how to protect yourself
while traveling abroad.
Apparently helped save the state

300
00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:42,583
by letting them know to let
their top operatives and
government agents not charge

301
00:29:42,583 --> 00:29:48,708
cell phones from their flying in
to China or Russia. Perhaps that
free cell phone charging kiosk

302
00:29:48,708 --> 00:29:54,708
at the embassy, wasn't such a
nice present. But none of the
information catalog included

303
00:29:58,042 --> 00:30:03,917
malicious cell phone kiosk
attacks. None of that
information got leaked. I will

304
00:30:03,917 --> 00:30:09,000
be adding because I talked to
Michael Austin a little while
ago, I will be adding the

305
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:14,542
tracking device and some
software for it to the NSA play
set which is what he's releasing

306
00:30:14,542 --> 00:30:20,750
here at DEF CON a series of
tools that are all open source.
Some of you may think it looks

307
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:25,958
fun to look at you can
explain... you can understand a
little bit more exactly how

308
00:30:25,958 --> 00:30:31,458
these juice jacking malicious
kiosks were using that was using
to pull data from the phones and

309
00:30:31,458 --> 00:30:37,375
push data to phones. Going back
to this cell phone bugs, they're
basically group of two sections

310
00:30:37,375 --> 00:30:42,625
there's malicious base stations
like, Cyclone Crossbeam, EBSR,
Entourage, Nebula, Typho and

311
00:30:42,625 --> 00:30:49,125
then there's intelligence
gathering tools. Gathering tools
are more like hardware like

312
00:30:49,125 --> 00:30:55,125
physical cell phone basically
like their hack of some phones
so they can use it for software

313
00:30:57,250 --> 00:31:03,292
radio, listen to RF frequencies
while on the ground, just look
like they're looking at their

314
00:31:03,292 --> 00:31:07,125
cell phone. That's basically
majority of what they are. They
can track cell phones using

315
00:31:07,125 --> 00:31:14,583
their cell phones signals or
again one of them, very popular
was candy gram which was a cell

316
00:31:14,583 --> 00:31:19,042
phone tracker basically so they
can follow you around allegedly
if they get your cell phone.

317
00:31:19,042 --> 00:31:23,875
Again, if you're traveling and
somebody from government agency
hands you a cell phone say, use

318
00:31:23,875 --> 00:31:29,833
this while you're abroad,
perhaps if you don't want to be
tracked you won't use it. base

319
00:31:29,833 --> 00:31:33,375
stations though, are a entirely
different thing because it's not
something that you physically

320
00:31:33,375 --> 00:31:39,167
had access. Pretty much never
know that malicious cell phone
base station may exist unless

321
00:31:39,167 --> 00:31:46,000
you take specific action here is
a basic idea of what you would
do. There are a lot of ‑‑

322
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:52,125
listening out on cell phone
networks, your cell phone may be
able to pair with and having

323
00:31:52,125 --> 00:31:57,292
your cell phone let you know if
something is new or something is
changing. Obviously everybody

324
00:31:57,292 --> 00:32:01,250
when you move around your cell
phone towers would change so the
point of this type of system

325
00:32:01,250 --> 00:32:08,792
keep one cell phone at your
office in basically a static
location and I assume that cell

326
00:32:08,792 --> 00:32:13,958
phone towers just pop up and go
down, pop up and go down unless
somebody is doing something

327
00:32:13,958 --> 00:32:20,208
funky with a cell or a rogue
network. That would be a reason
for you to be concerned what is

328
00:32:20,208 --> 00:32:25,333
happening in my area, perhaps
you may find that cell phone
tower that was available at your

329
00:32:25,333 --> 00:32:29,083
office is now available at your
home then it followed me to the
hotel down the street and

330
00:32:29,083 --> 00:32:34,083
another state. Maybe you want
the see what is going on, you
want to think a little bit. Now

331
00:32:34,083 --> 00:32:38,333
the difference is that you know
that there is a cell phone tower
for some reason that is

332
00:32:38,333 --> 00:32:45,542
following you. I don't have any
software to release with this.
There would be ‑‑ I built some

333
00:32:45,542 --> 00:32:51,458
test codes, some proof of
concepts it's a lot of false
positives. Especially whenever

334
00:32:51,458 --> 00:32:55,625
you start moving cell phones,
cell phone towers turn off and
on. I don't want to release

335
00:32:55,625 --> 00:33:02,583
something that freaks everybody
out. You have to make sure that
the phone stays in the same

336
00:33:02,583 --> 00:33:06,875
location, things don't change
too much around you, also I
don't think anybody really needs

337
00:33:06,875 --> 00:33:11,292
that because a lot of people
keep their one cell phone in
static location maybe if you're

338
00:33:11,292 --> 00:33:16,083
stuck in embassy trying to avoid
extradition. I don't know how
many there are in the world

339
00:33:16,083 --> 00:33:23,583
right now that might want fit
that guy wants to buy this
program I'll sell it to him. But

340
00:33:23,583 --> 00:33:28,417
again back on ‑‑ cell phones,
main problem, you do not control
the network. You control your

341
00:33:28,417 --> 00:33:33,542
device to a degree but you do
not control your network. You
have to remember that once

342
00:33:33,542 --> 00:33:38,375
information leaves your hands,
leaves your control, you have no
control over this. This doesn't

343
00:33:38,375 --> 00:33:44,625
cover with just cell phones but
servers, cloud, anything, star
cloud, anything cloud relayed.

344
00:33:44,625 --> 00:33:51,750
You have to remember honestly a
hat tip say, remember OPSEC at
all times, operational security

345
00:33:51,750 --> 00:33:58,458
without it you really will just
be toiling in the dark playing
in a playground and failing to

346
00:33:58,458 --> 00:34:03,958
detect or know anything but you
will be detected and people will
know what you're doing. If you

347
00:34:03,958 --> 00:34:08,125
remember to do OPSEC its the
best solution here for people ‑‑
the best solution for people who

348
00:34:08,125 --> 00:34:12,458
are concerned about these sort
of things especially if you use
some of these methods to detect

349
00:34:12,458 --> 00:34:18,750
surveillance states you want to
be sure to apply operational
security. Obviously detecting

350
00:34:18,750 --> 00:34:25,292
will know if you're operational
security as failed or not. In
conclusion here I don't know if

351
00:34:25,292 --> 00:34:31,292
there were any other questions.
Nope. Please feel free to come
up to one of the microphones

352
00:34:33,875 --> 00:34:39,792
that are available out there.
Find one of the speaker Goons.
The majority of this was mostly

353
00:34:39,792 --> 00:34:45,583
about an experiment, it's not ‑‑
it is really to invoke
discussion, bugs are detectable,

354
00:34:45,583 --> 00:34:49,625
meaning the information out
there has been out there it's
been discussed at hacker

355
00:34:49,625 --> 00:34:56,500
conferences over the years.
There's hard evidence which is
best for more so than hearsay.

356
00:34:56,500 --> 00:35:01,542
Tin foil hats are never stylish.
Here are the slide for
information on further reading,

357
00:35:01,542 --> 00:35:07,667
read exact specific blog posts
about specific types of things
that I was saying. I'll leave

358
00:35:07,667 --> 00:35:13,250
this on while I get through some
questions over here on the
right. >> I have a question.

359
00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:20,000
Some of the major Internet
service providers are deploying
a pilot where your home Wi‑Fi

360
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:26,042
basically becomes public Wi‑Fi.
How does this change things? >>
Well, now you're

361
00:35:26,042 --> 00:35:30,917
offering service... you're
becoming ISP at your home, how
would it change things for ISP

362
00:35:30,917 --> 00:35:35,917
or for yourself, or for your
home,or the places of liability
are being monitored. >> I'm

363
00:35:35,917 --> 00:35:42,583
thinking more from liability of
now your kind of access point to
people you don't know. >> Yeah.

364
00:35:42,583 --> 00:35:47,833
That gives you not liability but
that gives you plausible
deniability. I don't know if I

365
00:35:47,833 --> 00:35:55,750
was that person or not this is
why I'm not endorsing this
necessarily, this is do at your

366
00:35:55,750 --> 00:36:02,375
own risk but opening up your
Wi‑Fi have open Wi‑Fi access
allows you to say plausible

367
00:36:02,375 --> 00:36:08,375
deniability. Absolutely, yeah,
very risky to do that. Anything
can happen once you do that.

368
00:36:08,375 --> 00:36:12,167
You'll have to fight it off in
court but you'll have some
consideration of plausible

369
00:36:12,167 --> 00:36:15,208
deniability especially so if
you're ISP is turning it on for
the people. Mind you remember if

370
00:36:15,208 --> 00:36:21,208
the ISP is controlling ‑‑ if ISP
network or other people on the
same ISP or other people as a

371
00:36:24,750 --> 00:36:31,500
Wi‑Fi hot spot the they probably
have embedded something on that
to do remote monitoring and

372
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:37,375
caching that makes that hardware
not your hardware but their
hardware. So you don't own the

373
00:36:37,375 --> 00:36:44,042
hardware you would be able to
make changes or be worried or
control what's going on. I'll

374
00:36:44,042 --> 00:36:50,042
get guy behind you. >> Are
there ‑‑ most of these tools
sort of made by hand by NSA, CIA

375
00:36:55,208 --> 00:37:01,208
or ‑‑ >> Catalog, basically are
they made by hand. Catalogs has
items available for sale, I

376
00:37:06,042 --> 00:37:09,000
don't know if this was the
documents were released by a
third party that was trying to

377
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:15,542
sell it kind of like a skymall
for all the surveillance
hackers, but the information on

378
00:37:15,542 --> 00:37:20,125
it explicitly stated that the
hardware that they're using is
things that are available off

379
00:37:20,125 --> 00:37:25,500
the shelf. Again to reference
the NSA play set talks, they're
using items that are all off the

380
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:29,875
shelf and you can make
effectively the same things by
just going to the store or

381
00:37:29,875 --> 00:37:36,333
ordering things from Amazon.
Over here. >> Is there a reason
you're not saying Jake

382
00:37:36,333 --> 00:37:42,125
Applebaum's name >> I don't
know. I blacked out there. Who,
who are you talking about?

383
00:37:42,125 --> 00:37:48,125
(Laughter) >> I guess that did
answer the question. [ laughter
] >> Yes, Jacob Applebaum was

384
00:37:51,625 --> 00:37:58,750
researcher journalist who
released the information for Der
Spiegel . You can talk to me

385
00:37:58,750 --> 00:38:03,792
later about it especially after
a few drinks I'll be very, very
tended. Doing it for his

386
00:38:03,792 --> 00:38:09,792
protection not mine. Yes. >>
Your comments about TPM chips ‑‑
>> Oh No. Are you from Trusted

387
00:38:13,042 --> 00:38:19,042
Platform (Laughter) >> No. But I
am interested in TPM chips now
starting to see similar devices

388
00:38:23,792 --> 00:38:31,542
that are being embedded into
mainstream processors, from free
scale renaissance those devices

389
00:38:31,542 --> 00:38:38,083
are typically trust anchors; Do
you see that as something that
is going to continue to expand

390
00:38:38,083 --> 00:38:44,083
in various hardware fields? >>
Expand or continue to be trusted
platform modules or trust

391
00:38:46,333 --> 00:38:53,458
anchors, I don't know. I can't
say. What I do know is that the
people who are making these ‑‑

392
00:38:53,458 --> 00:38:59,917
who choose to pay to install
them are organizations, they're
businesses, more likely for a

393
00:38:59,917 --> 00:39:05,625
business purpose, if it's
business viable for them to put
it in they will put it in to the

394
00:39:05,625 --> 00:39:10,000
hardware. If it's not, I'll just
be frank, they're probably not
going to do it. There's some

395
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:16,042
awesome thing that made
surveillance state- actors in
basically ‑‑ makes your hardware

396
00:39:16,042 --> 00:39:20,958
impervious to surveillance more
likely [inaudible] is going to
get behind that make that

397
00:39:20,958 --> 00:39:28,167
available on the shelf. But
again it's a two‑sided thing.
While trusting platform modules

398
00:39:28,167 --> 00:39:33,042
and trust anchors can be used
from the manufacturer to protect
their investments, so they can

399
00:39:33,042 --> 00:39:38,958
tell people that this is exactly
how it works hopefully everybody
here would know how to break in

400
00:39:38,958 --> 00:39:44,583
to them, change them to make it
so that we can protect
ourselves. Going to be a weird

401
00:39:44,583 --> 00:39:49,000
give‑take going to be between
whether or not they have a
financial reason to install

402
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:55,458
these chips. Or help their
bottom line. >> I've been told
that the TPM chips are in many

403
00:39:55,458 --> 00:40:00,833
commercial devices today like
iPads, is that true? >> I do
not ‑‑ I'm not aware. You can

404
00:40:00,833 --> 00:40:05,667
ask somebody from Apple but I
think their answer... I can give
it to you... >> They won't

405
00:40:05,667 --> 00:40:09,958
answer. >> They won't answer.
Get them drunk enough perhaps
they will answer. That's very

406
00:40:09,958 --> 00:40:15,958
difficult. All right. I don't
see any more questions.
Afterwards, great. One more

407
00:40:19,375 --> 00:40:27,125
question. >> You mentioned the
software radios for finding RF
signals that ultimately you

408
00:40:27,125 --> 00:40:33,375
don't know. >> Yeah. >> Is there
any ‑‑ any good at open source
tools for triangulating them

409
00:40:33,375 --> 00:40:39,375
figure out where they're coming
from? >> There's tons of stuff
for that. Look up software radio

410
00:40:43,667 --> 00:40:49,667
types, I think it's RT-DR.com,
or search Google for software
radio. Tons of stuff, they all

411
00:40:52,250 --> 00:40:58,875
release their information,
talked how to triangulations the
series of based atenae based,

412
00:40:58,875 --> 00:41:05,125
things like that. All that data
is all online I would really
enjoy to look at more in to it

413
00:41:05,125 --> 00:41:11,792
myself give cool talks about it.
There are plenty of resources
out there that's easily well in

414
00:41:11,792 --> 00:41:18,375
to the hour‑long talk just to
get over the basics of the
triangulation. It is key to note

415
00:41:18,375 --> 00:41:23,792
that software defined radio, I
skipped over this, your hardware
will have a limit typically

416
00:41:23,792 --> 00:41:30,042
you'll see between two to five
gigahertz on the high end,
hacker f is about three

417
00:41:30,042 --> 00:41:36,333
gigahertz, I apologize if I'm
wrong but it's high. There is a
huge spectrum beyond the three

418
00:41:36,333 --> 00:41:41,667
gigahertz range that ‑‑
gigahertz range if any sort of
surveillance tools happen to

419
00:41:41,667 --> 00:41:47,875
work in those spectrums, good
luck. I apologize. Tens of
thousands of dollars to acquire

420
00:41:47,875 --> 00:41:55,208
the hardware to do that
protection. Fair warning. >>
There is actually one last

421
00:41:55,208 --> 00:42:01,833
question. Great presentation.
You keep making references
lately of course having a few

422
00:42:01,833 --> 00:42:09,000
drinks getting them drunk. I'm
assuming this is something that
you have had experience in the

423
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:15,000
past of getting information? >>
I don't know if I was
successful. I think I got too

424
00:42:17,208 --> 00:42:22,417
drunk in the process. >> The
tower concept you were talking
about. Does that cover like

425
00:42:22,417 --> 00:42:29,583
LTE , SYP handovers. 4G, 3G
handovers or is it specific to
one type of tower. >> Specific

426
00:42:29,583 --> 00:42:35,583
to the type of tower. >> You can
do a SYP handover and track
that. >> Yeah. That goes in

427
00:42:35,583 --> 00:42:39,792
to... yeah, you don't own that
hardware. You don't know what is
going on also one of the major

428
00:42:39,792 --> 00:42:44,083
reasons why I didn't want to
release anything that says this
is the solution because some

429
00:42:44,083 --> 00:42:48,542
networks can get way more
convoluted and complicated than
a simple app on your phone to

430
00:42:48,542 --> 00:42:53,292
tell you what is happening. >>
Need to know the S1 and
interface and [inaudible] >>

431
00:42:53,292 --> 00:42:58,083
Thank you. >> All right. Thank
you all for sticking around. [
