1
00:00:00,042 --> 00:00:05,250
>>I know many of you came here
expecting to see the Dr. Phil
from the Oprah Show. Talking

2
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:12,500
about relationships, drug
addiction, and eating too much.
But, in fact, this guys much

3
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:18,500
better. >> Alright, thanks for
that intro, well, it's probably
one of the better ones I've

4
00:00:24,417 --> 00:00:30,417
gotten. But ah, someone said to
me once, you're not THE Dr.
Phil. It's like, no, he's like

5
00:00:33,875 --> 00:00:39,875
the other guy. But anyway... So,
today, just want to talk a bit
about some cheap to free ways of

6
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,250
detecting surveillance. So maybe
you are a little paranoid and
thinking, I wonder if someone is

7
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:55,375
spying on me? We're going to
talk about some simple ways you
can find out if that's true or

8
00:00:55,375 --> 00:01:01,417
not. In particular we are going
talk a little about video
surveillance and also we are

9
00:01:01,417 --> 00:01:06,625
going to talk about tailing,
someone following you in your
vehicle. Also, some

10
00:01:06,625 --> 00:01:12,792
eavesdropping, also some other
physical surveillance. Also,
some other surveillance that

11
00:01:12,792 --> 00:01:19,375
could be embedded into your
technical devices and how you
might find those. Little bit

12
00:01:19,375 --> 00:01:24,958
about why should you care about
this stuff? Our government's
assault on our constitution is

13
00:01:24,958 --> 00:01:30,958
pretty much known. I don't know
if you can read this cartoon
very well, but it's like hey, I

14
00:01:30,958 --> 00:01:35,208
wonder what people think about
us violating their rights....
Why don't we check their emails

15
00:01:38,708 --> 00:01:44,750
and see. [Audience Laughter].
And it's not just the national
governments, it's the national

16
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:51,000
governments, competitors, it's
stalkers. Like this little lady
in the corner here, she looks

17
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,500
like a stalker. Some of you
might remember her from some of
her youtube videos. And

18
00:01:56,500 --> 00:02:02,583
sometimes there are people that
just don't like you. So they are
following you, waiting for you

19
00:02:02,583 --> 00:02:07,917
to do something. Okay, so first
I want to talk about video
surveillance. Now, when it comes

20
00:02:07,917 --> 00:02:13,917
to video surveillance, there are
different kinds of surveillance
today. Virtually everyone walks

21
00:02:18,208 --> 00:02:24,375
around with a video camera all
the time. Most people have them
in their smart phones. Even if

22
00:02:24,375 --> 00:02:30,500
you have a dumb phone, it
probably has a video camera in
it. So, I want to talk about

23
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:37,833
some of these phones, such as an
IP cameras. You've probably seen
things like this. Foscams are

24
00:02:37,833 --> 00:02:43,833
pretty popular, you just go to
Best Buy or some similar store,
buy a couple and plug them in.

25
00:02:46,792 --> 00:02:54,625
Maybe hide them, you get similar
technology, a nanny cam and
such. Now, if you have a night

26
00:02:54,625 --> 00:03:00,625
vision camera, there's a simple
way to detect this night vision
because there's a flaw that all

27
00:03:03,417 --> 00:03:09,417
these cameras share, and this
kind of demonstrates this flaw.
Which you are looking at, I have

28
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:17,958
a digital camera and I'm
directing it at a remote
control. So you may know some of

29
00:03:21,333 --> 00:03:27,333
this already. But digital
cameras of all forms, pick up
infrared light. So, if I go back

30
00:03:29,667 --> 00:03:35,667
here to this slide, you see all
those LEDs around these cameras.
Those are infrared LEDs that are

31
00:03:38,833 --> 00:03:44,833
used to illuminate the subject
of your camera during darkness.
So, if you have an infrared

32
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:54,792
remote, for your tv, whatever
and you're not sure if it's
working or if your battery is

33
00:03:54,792 --> 00:04:00,708
working, batteries dead, you can
just pull out your camera and
point it at the remote, push

34
00:04:00,708 --> 00:04:07,000
some buttons and you should see
lights flashing. The same thing
can be done to detect a night

35
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:13,000
vision camera that might be
spying on you. So, here's what
I've done, I've hidden a camera,

36
00:04:16,375 --> 00:04:22,375
can anyone see the camera? Yeah,
so I hid a camera behind flowers
in my workshop, and what you

37
00:04:26,792 --> 00:04:33,167
want to do, some of these
cameras are motion activated,
and so it's dark. Turn off the

38
00:04:33,167 --> 00:04:37,750
light, and so nobody's really
going to see – unless they have
a video camera and have been

39
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:41,458
taping it the whole time.
They've probably seen you do
something more embarrassing than

40
00:04:41,458 --> 00:04:48,167
(speaker waving his arms) than
this anyway. So, just grab your
video camera, (someone got a

41
00:04:48,167 --> 00:05:02,042
picture of that), move around,
wave your arms. And if you have
a video camera that is presently

42
00:05:02,042 --> 00:05:09,250
a video camera, you will
probably get something as
showing up on this screen.

43
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:11,750
Alright, it'll be very obvious,
these lights showing up on the
screen. Alright, there are some

44
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:19,958
other ways to detect infrared,
such as these little cards that
you can get. They probably don't

45
00:05:19,958 --> 00:05:28,500
work as well as just using your
video camera on your phone. But
you could do it this way. But,

46
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:34,583
in general, if you have some of
these wireless cameras, they are
nice, easy to set up things,

47
00:05:34,583 --> 00:05:41,458
which makes them easy to detect.
Okay, so I want to talk a little
about detecting wireless

48
00:05:41,458 --> 00:05:50,042
cameras. And first off, the free
way. If you have a wireless
camera, these are set up

49
00:05:50,042 --> 00:05:55,458
different ways. Sometimes they
are set up to existing wireless
networks, sometimes themselves

50
00:05:55,458 --> 00:06:02,917
as an access point, sometimes
adhoc. In particular, if they
are set up as an access point or

51
00:06:02,917 --> 00:06:12,875
adhoc network a pretty easy way
to find them is just to use your
Android tablet or smartphone and

52
00:06:12,875 --> 00:06:20,125
download a couple of free apps.
This one is just called WiFi
Analyzer. You download this app

53
00:06:20,125 --> 00:06:30,417
and you can look and see, oh, I
see some suspicious networks.
And you will say, hey what's

54
00:06:30,417 --> 00:06:37,417
this spying on Phil network?
Sometimes it will be anonymous,
unnamed network or an adhoc

55
00:06:37,417 --> 00:06:44,458
network. But if there's another
network that's pretty strong,
that's another clue. You have a

56
00:06:44,458 --> 00:06:51,458
pretty strong network in your
house, and you're not expecting
to have that and it's not your

57
00:06:51,458 --> 00:06:59,542
home network, it's suspicious.
By the way, thinking about being
suspicious, I just bought a new

58
00:06:59,542 --> 00:07:07,500
laptop recently, and I was
running Windows 8.1 and I was
noticing, hey, don't hate me it

59
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:17,417
came with it. I don't normally
run windows and I'm not running
now. So, I thought it was

60
00:07:17,417 --> 00:07:24,083
running kind of slow, and I look
at the task manager, and there's
this video camera app, consuming

61
00:07:24,083 --> 00:07:28,333
100% of my disc IO? And I'm not
running my video camera app?
Little suspicious. Okay, some

62
00:07:28,333 --> 00:07:46,042
other ways you might detect
video cameras etc., you can use
something inexpensive, something

63
00:07:46,042 --> 00:07:52,167
you know. I like the
BeagleBones, done a lot of work
with the BeagleBones. Developed

64
00:07:52,167 --> 00:08:01,208
my own linux, the deck on the
BeagleBones. So, in this picture
I have a couple systems. Up in

65
00:08:01,208 --> 00:08:08,292
the upper left, it's my picture
of my famous Buzz Lightyear Hack
you to infinity and beyond

66
00:08:08,292 --> 00:08:15,708
lunchbox computer. And down in
the lower left corner, it is the
same thing, a BeagleBone running

67
00:08:15,708 --> 00:08:22,542
the deck with a 7 inch
touchscreen. By the way, that
touchscreen is from a company

68
00:08:22,542 --> 00:08:29,125
called 4D Systems and they just
started making some stuff for
the Beagles. Seems to have some

69
00:08:29,125 --> 00:08:33,083
good stuff and it's a little
cheaper than some of the other
stuff out there, just a little

70
00:08:33,083 --> 00:08:45,292
tip. And then on the right, I
have a couple BeagleBone systems
with touchscreens and a wireless

71
00:08:45,292 --> 00:08:54,583
antenna, simple wifi, alpha
adapter you've probably seen
before, little keyboard. And in

72
00:08:54,583 --> 00:09:05,333
the lower right hand corner, I
didn't do it, because it would
make the picture less clear but

73
00:09:05,333 --> 00:09:08,250
you can do it, take all that
stuff and tape it onto the
wireless antenna and have a nice

74
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:17,167
little bug detector. Kind of on
the go. So, if you're feeling
lazy, you can take that set up

75
00:09:17,167 --> 00:09:25,958
and you can run your standard
Airodump and the Airodump at the
bottom will show you the clients

76
00:09:25,958 --> 00:09:35,958
and also shows you the power. So
you notice the top one shows
powers was minus 28 and now it's

77
00:09:35,958 --> 00:09:43,125
gone to 30. Smaller negative
numbers are better when it comes
to power. You can use that and

78
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:54,208
you can pan around your office,
your house, wherever you are and
look for wireless signals.

79
00:09:54,208 --> 00:10:06,208
Alright, now with just a little
bit more work, you can make this
better. And everything's better

80
00:10:06,208 --> 00:10:14,833
with Python, right. So, just a
little Python script that I
wrote, yeah, I realize you

81
00:10:14,833 --> 00:10:21,750
probably aren't going to be able
to read that and or copy it
during this but the slides will

82
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:27,583
be available later, so, feel
free to get it later. But, I
just wrote a simple Python

83
00:10:27,583 --> 00:10:35,292
script and what it was is scapy,
some of you are probably
familiar with that. And it uses

84
00:10:35,292 --> 00:10:39,583
the radio tap headers which
include the power or the signal
strength. So what I do is

85
00:10:39,583 --> 00:10:47,250
capture for about 2 seconds and
I record the different devices
that I have found and which were

86
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:54,042
their strongest signals I
displayed on the screen, wait a
second, blank the screen,

87
00:10:54,042 --> 00:11:04,542
repeat. And basically if you do
that and you run it, you get
something kind of like this. You

88
00:11:04,542 --> 00:11:11,042
will see the strongest signals
at the top and now it's a minus
5 so that's a good strong signal

89
00:11:11,042 --> 00:11:21,000
so that means I just went past
something emitting a bunch of
wireless traffic. In a little

90
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:29,208
bit here you will see I swept
back and pinpointed exactly
where that device is. You don't

91
00:11:29,208 --> 00:11:43,458
see it in the screen capture but
what I essentially did was, I
had my foscam and my big old

92
00:11:43,458 --> 00:11:47,000
yagi antenna and I just swept
the room and got that minus 5,
kept going – came back and was

93
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:57,042
able to say, that's where the
bug is. That's where that video
camera is. That's pretty cheap.

94
00:11:57,042 --> 00:12:04,000
The BeagleBones, $45,maybe a
little less if you get a deal.
If you want to spend a little

95
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:17,583
bit more money. This talk is
about how you can do this free
or for very little money.

96
00:12:17,583 --> 00:12:22,625
Obviously, if you like to spend
money, you can go buy the
commercial detectors. If you've

97
00:12:22,625 --> 00:12:29,458
got thousands of dollars to
spend, go for it. Ah, but
another fairly cheap way you can

98
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:37,500
detect these sorts of things is
to use this little board from
Linear Technologies, RF meter

99
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:51,125
chip, called LTC5582 and you can
use this to detect a signal. Any
kind of RF signal. And if you're

100
00:12:51,125 --> 00:12:58,750
only interested in frequencies,
like say wireless frequencies or
some other frequencies that you

101
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:04,875
suspect some bugs might be
working on. When we're talking
about video cameras, we are

102
00:13:04,875 --> 00:13:13,167
talking mostly wireless ones. So
probably the standard 2.4 ghz
frequency would be fine. You can

103
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:20,417
detect them with a very simple
circuit. Alright, they make the
raw chips, but they also make

104
00:13:20,417 --> 00:13:27,792
this little demonstration
circuit. This board is about
$100 so, it's not free but not

105
00:13:27,792 --> 00:13:36,583
terribly expensive. To the right
is an example of a band pass
filter, basically you just screw

106
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:47,250
it onto the adapter. It will go
between this board and your
antenna. And your circuit's

107
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:57,208
going to look kind of like this.
Oh, I forgot to warn you guys,
there's a guy that's going to

108
00:13:57,208 --> 00:14:03,583
have a really good talk after
me... so if my talk starts to
suck, if you hang around you

109
00:14:03,583 --> 00:14:08,417
will get a good seat for the
next guy. He won't suck so much
– just letting you know. Little

110
00:14:08,417 --> 00:14:14,958
fyi there. So, it's a pretty
simple circuit, you know you
hook this up to your directional

111
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:27,333
antenna you hook up some power
to the 2 top leads. You get an
output voltage and you also have

112
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:35,417
to hook up the ground. You know,
you can just hook up a meter to
it. You can use a meter, you can

113
00:14:35,417 --> 00:14:37,833
use a BeagleBone, use whatever
you want. Basically, you just
need to measure the voltage

114
00:14:37,833 --> 00:14:47,625
coming off of that and that's
another way to go. Let's talk a
little bit about physical

115
00:14:47,625 --> 00:14:55,583
surveillance. All right. Is
somebody following you in your
car or tailing you? We're going

116
00:14:55,583 --> 00:15:02,125
to talk a little bit about
common vehicles that are used in
tailing, some standard

117
00:15:02,125 --> 00:15:08,917
techniques and we'll talk a
little bit about stake outs.
Often those are also done from

118
00:15:08,917 --> 00:15:13,708
vehicles and what are some
standard techniques you might
find and then we'll kind of move

119
00:15:13,708 --> 00:15:23,750
on from there and talk about
what could you possibly do in
order to actively with thwart.

120
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:48,083
You will probably not use a red
Ferrari. If you're in texts the
most common vehicle might be an

121
00:15:48,083 --> 00:15:55,708
F150 pick up truck. If you're
smart and are going to follow
somebody you will pick a vehicle

122
00:15:55,708 --> 00:16:03,417
that kind of blends in. Not
something that's super bright,
really flashy, you know.

123
00:16:03,417 --> 00:16:08,417
Something that everyone you
drive by and they're like I
always wanted one of those.

124
00:16:08,417 --> 00:16:14,750
Nothing like that. So a nice
colored vehicles, SUV's are
popular in certain areas and you

125
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:25,083
might expect to see that. You
know, government spys on people.
Traditionally what's the

126
00:16:25,083 --> 00:16:36,542
stereotype? Black SUV. Right?
Sometimes there's a little truth
to things like that. Of course

127
00:16:36,542 --> 00:16:42,333
Crown Victorias are popular.
That doesn't mean that you
should only look for those kinds

128
00:16:42,333 --> 00:16:48,208
of vehicles. Depending on how
interested people are in you,
you know, they'll get all kinds

129
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:59,292
of different vehicles. They'll
get women and children, old
people, you know, all kinds of

130
00:16:59,292 --> 00:17:03,583
people you don't suspect are
working for the FBI but they
are. All right. So some general

131
00:17:03,583 --> 00:17:10,542
techniques. If you're following
somebody the follow distance is
going to vary. Generally from

132
00:17:10,542 --> 00:17:16,208
about 2 cars behind you, you
know, typically it's kind of
frowned on to be right behind

133
00:17:16,208 --> 00:17:23,500
somebody that you're following
because they might notice to a
couple of blocks. And a lot

134
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:30,833
depends on things such as, you
know, is it just one car? Is it
the stalker that we saw earlier?

135
00:17:30,833 --> 00:17:40,250
Or is it a government? All
right. So if it's one car or
even if it's multiple cars they

136
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:47,167
might extend that range using a
bumper beeper. Now there are
different kinds of bumper

137
00:17:47,167 --> 00:17:54,750
beepers. Simple ones like
literally something that just
makes a tone on a certain

138
00:17:54,750 --> 00:18:04,542
frequency to its a GPS tracker.
All right. Generally speaking a
tail is considered to be blown

139
00:18:04,542 --> 00:18:13,958
if you've had 3 suspicious
impressions. Like if you're
following somebody, not that any

140
00:18:13,958 --> 00:18:18,083
of you have ever followed
anybody because that would be
bad but if you're following

141
00:18:18,083 --> 00:18:26,083
somebody and they look right at
you 3 times or do something
similar like act strangely

142
00:18:26,083 --> 00:18:35,375
because they think they're being
followed, typically most people
say, all right, we're done. All

143
00:18:35,375 --> 00:18:42,292
right. So single car tailing
generally speaking as I said you
will be a little closer then

144
00:18:42,292 --> 00:18:49,417
with multicar tails. You can't
afford to lose somebody if it's
this. You're more likely to

145
00:18:49,417 --> 00:18:58,167
follow traffic laws, running a
couple lights. A little
suspicious. And again you might

146
00:18:58,167 --> 00:19:04,500
use something like a bumper
beeper in order to help extend
your range. This picture down in

147
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:09,292
the corner is an example of a
bumper beeper. If you look at
the long tube it has a couple of

148
00:19:09,292 --> 00:19:20,458
magnets on it and there's
electronics you can cram in
there with good batteries and

149
00:19:20,458 --> 00:19:25,125
you just slap it on someone's
car. It doesn't have to be the
bumper but some metal part. And

150
00:19:25,125 --> 00:19:30,750
track away. All right. Multicar
tailing. Typically if you got
multicar tailing it's probably

151
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:38,542
not stalker. It's probably
somebody else. In most cases
everyone is behind you. Again,

152
00:19:38,542 --> 00:19:47,250
most cases. Not a hard and fast
rule. Sometimes you might have
cars on parallel streets not

153
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:53,500
just all behind you in a big
caravan. If you're in an urban
area, if you're in the country

154
00:19:53,500 --> 00:20:04,125
they're probably just behind
you. Also, you might see cars
taking relative positions and

155
00:20:04,125 --> 00:20:14,708
having that change. So that
you're not always seeing the
same car behind you. Now here's

156
00:20:14,708 --> 00:20:19,500
a big give away. If you see
vehicles that appear to go a
different direction. They turn

157
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:26,875
off somewhere then they
magically reappear later either
they're lost or they're

158
00:20:26,875 --> 00:20:36,042
following you. So decide if
you're paranoid or not. Okay. So
how can you combat tailing? The

159
00:20:36,042 --> 00:20:46,458
number one thing you can do to
combat tailing... Look. Have a
little situational awareness.

160
00:20:46,458 --> 00:20:52,292
Look around you. You know, when
you're going places don't just
look ahead. Look around. When

161
00:20:52,292 --> 00:21:04,125
you're getting in your vehicle
check your car. Look for
trackers. Look for vehicles that

162
00:21:04,125 --> 00:21:08,250
seem to be behind you for a long
distance. You know, maybe
they're just going the same way.

163
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:13,750
Maybe not. And again watch for
those vehicle that is go away
then suddenly come back. That's

164
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:21,833
a little bit suspicious. You
know, if you see that happen I
would say that's one impression.

165
00:21:21,833 --> 00:21:29,625
You have two more things happen,
they're probably done. Other
things you can do. Detect

166
00:21:29,625 --> 00:21:39,667
electronic devices. I'm sure
many of you know what this scene
is from. He find the GPS tracker

167
00:21:39,667 --> 00:21:48,833
on his car. How can you detect
these electronic devices? You
can use the RF detection system

168
00:21:48,833 --> 00:21:53,667
previously described. Typically
if you use that don't use the
band filters. Some really simple

169
00:21:53,667 --> 00:22:11,750
ways, if someone has a
simplistic bumper beeper you
might be able to detect that

170
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:17,250
just by tuning in your AM radio.
I know nobody uses AM radio in
their car. Nobody uses the radio

171
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:23,792
in their car. Right? It's all
Bluetooth connection to iPad or
iPod and things like that.

172
00:22:23,792 --> 00:22:32,542
So... Anyway... Some of these
home made and cheaply available
trackers operate on the AM band

173
00:22:32,542 --> 00:22:39,500
so if you scan through that band
and you hear this nice strong
tone and it's always nice and

174
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:45,583
strong and it's just a tone
guess what? It's probably you.
All right. It's probably

175
00:22:45,583 --> 00:22:53,208
something on your car. Other
things you can do, some active
techniques. You can drag at the

176
00:22:53,208 --> 00:23:00,125
traffic light. If you don't know
what that means basically you
can try to time it so you're the

177
00:23:00,125 --> 00:23:08,333
last person that gets through a
traffic light and if someone
tries to run the light or

178
00:23:08,333 --> 00:23:14,583
whatever then you can be
suspicious. Take unusual routes.
Don't take the normal route that

179
00:23:14,583 --> 00:23:23,833
somebody would to go to whenever
your destination is or switch up
your route. Don't take the same

180
00:23:23,833 --> 00:23:31,000
route every day. You can also
try driving through some
residential neighborhoods. You

181
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:37,333
might look suspicious. I just
moved and I live in a
neighborhood ‑‑ there's only a

182
00:23:37,333 --> 00:23:42,208
couple entrances and they all
let out on the exact same
street. So if you follow me

183
00:23:42,208 --> 00:23:48,583
through my neighborhood it looks
very suspicious. Like why would
anyone drive in there? Unless

184
00:23:48,583 --> 00:23:55,458
you're going there, there would
be no reason. Don't be afraid to
take a few alleys or deserted

185
00:23:55,458 --> 00:24:05,042
side streets. Occasionally you
might even just park your car.
No reason. Sit on the side for a

186
00:24:05,042 --> 00:24:08,042
couple minutes. If you're real
paranoid, get out of your car.
Only in a good neighborhood.

187
00:24:08,042 --> 00:17:46,625
Right? Phil told me to get out
of my car. I was afraid someone
was following me and guess what?

188
00:24:12,542 --> 00:24:21,667
I got mugged. I am not
responsible for anything you do
from what you hear in my talk.

189
00:24:21,667 --> 00:24:28,333
All right. Other things, all
right. So that's tailing or
mobile surveillance. What about

190
00:24:28,333 --> 00:24:41,250
stationary surveillance or stake
out? Again a lot of this occurs
in a vehicle. Not always. But

191
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:50,458
sometimes. You might expect the
same vehicles to be used as in
tailing. Additionally sometimes

192
00:24:50,458 --> 00:24:56,333
people like a little bit more
room so they might have an SUV,
commercial van, pick up truck

193
00:24:56,333 --> 00:25:03,375
with a nice Topper, things like
that. This picture down in the
corner is actually from an

194
00:25:03,375 --> 00:25:12,417
article I found on‑line and make
your own surveillance van. All
right. Now I got a question for

195
00:25:12,417 --> 00:25:18,125
you guys. If you make your own
surveillance van should you put
Tony's pizza on the side of it?

196
00:25:18,125 --> 00:25:25,625
What's wrong with that? There's
no phone number. Okay. What else
is wrong with it? >> [Off mic]

197
00:25:25,625 --> 00:25:31,500
>> Who delivers pizza in a van
and when you deliver pizza what
do you do? You deliver the pizza

198
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:45,250
and leave. If you make your own
surveillance van pick a plumber,
electrician, sewage guy, septic.

199
00:25:45,250 --> 00:26:05,208
Put mud on the side. All right.
How can you combat stationary
surveillance? Again the best

200
00:26:05,208 --> 00:26:16,208
thing you can do, look. You
know, look for people. Sometimes
people stop for a little bit.

201
00:26:16,208 --> 00:26:21,833
Maybe they're waiting for
somebody. But if you're sitting
in your car for more than 5

202
00:26:21,833 --> 00:26:26,792
minutes, yeah, I'm suspicious.
Especially if you're eating
donuts and wearing a cop

203
00:26:26,792 --> 00:26:35,958
uniform. But other things to
look for. Now this one is a
little rough. Construction,

204
00:26:35,958 --> 00:26:44,583
utility workers who appear not
to be doing anything.
[Laughing]. Yeah sometimes they

205
00:26:44,583 --> 00:26:52,000
don't ever look like they're
doing anything. You know? You
know, it's the old joke. Slow,

206
00:26:52,000 --> 00:27:01,125
men working. Okay. The slow men
are working. Or is it slow,
because the men are working? All

207
00:27:01,125 --> 00:27:11,500
right. So I have to get a
grammar Nazi on that. So yeah,
especially I know this is a

208
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:16,625
stereotype but if you've got
some guy on a pole if you know
anything about people that do

209
00:27:16,625 --> 00:27:24,625
like cable and phone work they
don't like to go up and sit on
that pole all day long. They go

210
00:27:24,625 --> 00:27:29,500
up and do what they have to do
and come down. So if you have
somebody parked up there and

211
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:37,958
eating a sandwich it's probably
not a cable guy. Right? And
again even if it's not Tony's

212
00:27:37,958 --> 00:27:44,625
pizza you get commercial
vehicles that seem to be parked
for a long time, um... Another

213
00:27:44,625 --> 00:27:52,708
big clue. If there's anyone that
has a view of all of your exits.
All right. Someone that has

214
00:27:52,708 --> 00:28:02,250
conveniently placed themselves
in a spot where they can see
every exit to your house or to

215
00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:12,333
your office, that's probably not
a co‑incidence. All right? Some
active techniques. Get out your

216
00:28:12,333 --> 00:28:21,958
binoculars. Spy back. Why not?
All right. Do you think that
would be an impression? They

217
00:28:21,958 --> 00:28:32,000
would be like hey he's spying
back at me. I'm pretty sure that
this one is blown. All right. So

218
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:46,083
don't be afraid to do that. Do
strange things. You know, run
outside. Jump in your car. Run

219
00:28:46,083 --> 00:28:49,375
back inside the house. See if
anybody suddenly started their
car. Maybe your neighbors are

220
00:28:49,375 --> 00:28:58,458
like it's just Phil. Drive
around the block. See if anybody
follows you. It might sound

221
00:28:58,458 --> 00:29:04,792
stupid but simple things like
that, you know, you drive around
the block and someone thinks

222
00:29:04,792 --> 00:29:10,375
you're going to go somewhere.
Maybe they'll move towards your
house, maybe they'll follow you.

223
00:29:10,375 --> 00:29:20,083
All right. Audio bugging. You
can get various kinds of audio
bugs. You can go on the internet

224
00:29:20,083 --> 00:29:25,583
and buy these things. I really
like this one in it is upper
right hand corner. Nice apple

225
00:29:25,583 --> 00:29:30,292
logo on it. Nobody suspects
anything with an apple logo on
it. Right? Slap it on the back

226
00:29:30,292 --> 00:29:43,542
of someone's iPhone or iPod and
bug away. You do have some
different kinds of bugs. Some of

227
00:29:43,542 --> 00:29:52,417
them are radio transmitters.
Some of them use DSM phone
networks. The GSM phone networks

228
00:29:52,417 --> 00:29:58,000
a little bit harder to detect.
Not a lot but a little bit. Also
a little bit more expensive to

229
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:06,583
use because you have to have a
phone account and all these
things. Some freeways you can do

230
00:30:06,583 --> 00:30:13,208
it, you can get your AM/FM
radio. You can use the software
defined radio such as the little

231
00:30:13,208 --> 00:30:27,000
dongle I have in this picture
connected to a begal bone. You
can use an FDR by the way. If

232
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:36,458
you're going to use the cheap
little TVdongle you should know
they work usually 50 megahertz.

233
00:30:36,458 --> 00:30:47,708
They will not necessarily detect
all the bugs but if you have one
laying around anyway it doesn't

234
00:30:47,708 --> 00:30:53,208
cost you anything. Moderately
expensive way you can use that
circuit I described earlier with

235
00:30:53,208 --> 00:31:03,167
the linear technology RF power
meter or you can drop 500 bucks
for this thing down in the

236
00:31:03,167 --> 00:31:11,542
corner. If you got the money and
you want to buy a new toy maybe
it's for your office. Right?

237
00:31:11,542 --> 00:31:21,375
Mr. President we need this. 500
bucks. What's our safety worth?
How could you use an AM/FM

238
00:31:21,375 --> 00:31:30,542
radio? Basically you have to
have an analogue radio. You can
buy these probably at the dollar

239
00:31:30,542 --> 00:31:39,292
store. Scan for the AM/FM range.
If you hear yourself, if you
hear the audio you're generating

240
00:31:39,292 --> 00:31:48,375
be it your voice or radio or
whatever then it's probably you
being retransmitted. So... This

241
00:31:48,375 --> 00:32:00,542
is only going to work with some
of the simplest bugs but again
it's worth a shot. All right.

242
00:32:00,542 --> 00:32:12,083
Now what about passive bugs?
Bugs that aren't always on. You
can try to excite them.

243
00:32:12,083 --> 00:32:22,917
Basically you can have some
passive bugs that get
irradiated. You don't have to be

244
00:32:22,917 --> 00:32:28,375
on the exact frequency to make
it work. If you blast a lot of
power at these devices they will

245
00:32:28,375 --> 00:32:36,375
probably generate some sort of
signal that you can detect. I
remember many years ago I had a

246
00:32:36,375 --> 00:32:44,667
friend who was really into CB
radios and he also liked to buy
illegal amplifiers. So this guy

247
00:32:44,667 --> 00:32:49,625
had a thousand watt amp he
bought from some guy and hooked
it up to the CB and he was in

248
00:32:49,625 --> 00:32:57,792
the parking lot and we dropped
off a buddy and we were in the
store and guess what was coming

249
00:32:57,792 --> 00:33:04,500
over the intercom in the store?
This guy. He was way off the
frequency but the signal was so

250
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:10,958
powerful it was bleeding over.
It's kinds of a similar thing
with exciting these RF bugs

251
00:33:10,958 --> 00:33:26,750
where, you know, if you're close
to the frequency and you shoot
them with enough power you can

252
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:31,708
probably get them to at least
turn on, generate some sort of
signal you can then detect. All

253
00:33:31,708 --> 00:33:35,375
right? So what are you going to
use? You know, again the freeway
you probably have an alpha card

254
00:33:35,375 --> 00:33:39,458
and nice directional antenna.
Just crank that sucker up. By
the way if you don't know this

255
00:33:39,458 --> 00:33:43,667
with those alpha cards you have
to tell it it's visiting another
country if you want to crank up

256
00:33:43,667 --> 00:33:50,542
the power. Bulgaria is nice by
the way. I've never been there.
I'm not going to say my alpha

257
00:33:50,542 --> 00:33:56,583
card has been there. It might
have been there. I'm not going
to commit. Anyway FCC doesn't

258
00:33:56,583 --> 00:34:03,500
like it. No it's never been
there. Scratch that. Mine has
never been there. But you can

259
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:11,333
change that and give it a little
bit of a signal boost. Other
things. There have been some

260
00:34:11,333 --> 00:34:16,417
other folks that have talked
about these. Some of you might
notice these pictures as some of

261
00:34:16,417 --> 00:34:28,000
the NSA bugs. Jacob Applebaum
described some of these bugs
recently in Germany and they can

262
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:38,417
be installed when shipments are
intercepted. You buy something
through Amazon and it comes with

263
00:34:38,417 --> 00:34:41,625
your NSA bug. Service
professionals, your own IT
people, people just don't like.

264
00:34:41,625 --> 00:34:48,792
you. If you're going to
piss somebody off make sure they
have no skills. All right. All

265
00:34:48,792 --> 00:34:57,083
right. How do you detect these
bugs? Again the free way. Look.
If you know what the bugs look

266
00:34:57,083 --> 00:35:05,917
like, look for them. If you
didn't know what they looked
like and you open up your

267
00:35:05,917 --> 00:35:10,125
computer you probably wouldn't
find them. You know, some of
these are pretty clever and they

268
00:35:10,125 --> 00:35:17,583
just look like regular stuff.
You know, some of them are
attached to debugging ports that

269
00:35:17,583 --> 00:35:26,292
Dell conveniently left there
just for that purpose, for their
own internal debugging. Other

270
00:35:26,292 --> 00:35:31,625
things you can do. You can
look ‑‑ you might have some drop
boxes. I've talked about drop

271
00:35:31,625 --> 00:35:41,125
boxes before a little bit last
year at DEF CON. And some of
those drop boxes are pretty

272
00:35:41,125 --> 00:35:48,250
easily hidden and stuff on your
desk. I'll show you some
examples. So really you need to

273
00:35:48,250 --> 00:35:57,708
check every device especially
those that are connected to your
network or USB. USB is great if

274
00:35:57,708 --> 00:36:09,583
you want to hack somebody. All
right. I love USB. So here are a
couple hiding places. I stole

275
00:36:09,583 --> 00:36:22,833
these from my book so I guess
it's okay to steal pictures out
of your own book. In the upper

276
00:36:22,833 --> 00:36:27,250
left it's an access panel in the
floor in a classroom. So I have
power, I have networking and I

277
00:36:27,250 --> 00:36:37,958
have enough space for the drop
box. Lower left is one of my
favorites. Desktop defender from

278
00:36:37,958 --> 00:36:47,417
Think Gate. Anyone heard of
these before? Maybe some of you
have them. They're nice toys.

279
00:36:47,417 --> 00:36:51,167
You put them on your desk.
People come by and tell at you.
It's USB powered which is

280
00:36:51,167 --> 00:36:55,792
awesome. Because I can put a
drop box in there. USB power it.
I got power forever. I got a

281
00:36:55,792 --> 00:37:01,417
hand sanitizer dispenser not
completely full. Space on the
top. Again drop box. And the

282
00:37:01,417 --> 00:37:11,125
little talking tortoise toy. So
plenty of space for a drop box.
So look. Again look. Pictures

283
00:37:11,125 --> 00:37:31,125
have been released. You can also
look for current links. Unless a
bug is battery powered it needs

284
00:37:31,125 --> 00:37:36,792
power from you. So it will leech
power somehow. Turned off
devices kind of like a video

285
00:37:36,792 --> 00:37:44,583
camera shouldn't be consuming
resources. So one way that you
can detect this is you can use a

286
00:37:44,583 --> 00:37:59,417
modified universal lap top power
supply and what you do is you
modify it so you can read out

287
00:37:59,417 --> 00:38:04,750
some current that's flowing and
if you have a lap top or phone
and you can remove the battery

288
00:38:04,750 --> 00:38:08,833
just pull the battery, turn it
off and then hook it up. If
there's current flowing

289
00:38:08,833 --> 00:38:14,583
something's wrong. Right? Now
sometimes there might be a
little bit of current like your

290
00:38:14,583 --> 00:38:19,083
laptop to run LED's and things
like that but, you know, if
there's much current at all

291
00:38:19,083 --> 00:38:23,625
could be something to
investigate. Now if you have a
tablet or can't remove the

292
00:38:23,625 --> 00:38:27,833
battery it's harder. You want to
fully charge it then see if
there's much current that's

293
00:38:27,833 --> 00:38:33,125
flowing when it's turned off. If
you have a bad charging circuit
you might have some current

294
00:38:33,125 --> 00:38:44,292
flowing so you have to be
careful with this method. If you
have another device and you can

295
00:38:44,292 --> 00:38:55,708
measure its current flow to get
kind of a base line that would
be the best. Okay. So here's the

296
00:38:55,708 --> 00:39:00,958
basic idea. You have your lap
top adapter which has a series
of plugs and you hack a little

297
00:39:00,958 --> 00:39:10,292
cable and you break one of the
lines so that you can put a
meter on it and detect how much

298
00:39:10,292 --> 00:39:17,250
current is flowing. All right?
It's kind of like this. In the
upper left hand corner is my

299
00:39:17,250 --> 00:39:21,750
little adapted wire. Basically
had an extension cord for this
connecter. I just hacked the

300
00:39:21,750 --> 00:39:26,500
ends off it and I solderedered
it up on a board and you can
plug it in line to this adapter

301
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:42,750
I got for $13 on Amazon,
something like that. All right?
And then get the right adapter

302
00:39:42,750 --> 00:39:49,250
tip, set the voltage, connect it
to your device, measure the
current. Desktop computers same

303
00:39:49,250 --> 00:39:58,667
idea. I recommend physical
inspection because it's easier.
Sometimes the power supplies

304
00:39:58,667 --> 00:40:04,167
will leak a little bit of
current. So if you see a little
bit of current flowing don't be

305
00:40:04,167 --> 00:40:15,667
suspicious. Always be suspicious
but... Other things about
desktop bugs they might only

306
00:40:15,667 --> 00:40:20,292
work when the desktop is on. So
you have to be aware of that.
This method might not protect

307
00:40:20,292 --> 00:40:26,958
everything. Some passive bugs,
same thing. Excited just like
the audio bugs we talked about.

308
00:40:26,958 --> 00:40:35,625
Uses the same kind of techniques
in order to try and detect it.
Now you're not going to detect

309
00:40:35,625 --> 00:40:42,833
everything. You know, like the
NSA bugs probably not. But again
what can you do for cheap to

310
00:40:42,833 --> 00:40:55,000
free? All right. So in summary I
would say choose your level of
paranoia. You know, even if

311
00:40:55,000 --> 00:41:04,167
you're not paranoid though you
can still detect a lot of these
spying attempts at no cost or

312
00:41:04,167 --> 00:41:12,625
little cost and if you're truly
paranoid but you're not rich you
can still test some of these

313
00:41:12,625 --> 00:41:20,667
things without financial ruin. A
couple of references. A little
bit more about the BeagleBone

314
00:41:20,667 --> 00:41:40,792
stuff. You can find that in my
book and here's a reference to
Jake Applebaum's NSA talk that

315
00:41:40,792 --> 00:41:44,833
he gave and if you have
questions you can talk to me
later. Again don't leave though

316
00:41:44,833 --> 00:41:49,375
because the next guy is really
good. He doesn't suck so much.
All right? People on Twitter or

317
00:41:49,375 --> 00:41:52,625
you can go to one of my websites
and, you know, again for the
BeagleBone stuff there's more in

318
00:41:52,625 --> 00:00:00,000
my book website and all that. So
thanks. [Applause].
