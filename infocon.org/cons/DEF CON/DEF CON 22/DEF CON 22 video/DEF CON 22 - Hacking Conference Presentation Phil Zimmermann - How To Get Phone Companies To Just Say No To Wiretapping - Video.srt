1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,458
I've a little story to tell you.
This happens occasionally. Some
of you may remember about eight

2
00:00:05,458 --> 00:00:14,292
years ago a guy by the name of
Mike decided to do a talk. His
employer did not appreciate

3
00:00:14,292 --> 00:00:23,250
that, and he said, fuck you, I'm
going to talk. That was very
brave. We don't all have that

4
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:38,375
luxury. We have a person that
works on incredibly important
things, but he got his talk

5
00:00:38,375 --> 00:00:45,000
accepted. Everything went
through the right channels. He
was all set to speak at DEF CON,

6
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:54,333
and his employer said, don't do
that. They said it with
prejudice. So we will call this

7
00:00:54,333 --> 00:01:06,833
person agent zero. He cannot be
on camera, but he is here and he
does have a shot. Direct your

8
00:01:06,833 --> 00:01:15,417
attention over there, patient
zero, why don't you give us a
little ‑‑ I don't see him. Where

9
00:01:15,417 --> 00:01:21,542
is he? There he is. How about
some DEF CON love for patient
zero? You can do better than

10
00:01:21,542 --> 00:01:34,125
that! ( Cheers and applause ) >>
We're supposed to do our shots
here. First‑time speakers all do

11
00:01:34,125 --> 00:01:42,250
a shot. Thank you very much.
Hopefully when you're in front
of all these beautiful people.

12
00:01:42,250 --> 00:02:02,042
Thank you. Now, Phil Zimmerman.
( Applause ) >> Hi. Well, it's
good to be here again. You know,

13
00:02:02,042 --> 00:02:14,417
there's a story that I think is
a good story. It is that
sometime in the 19th century

14
00:02:14,417 --> 00:02:19,958
Americans or at least a lot of
Americans thought that tomatoes
were toxic. They thought if you

15
00:02:19,958 --> 00:02:26,292
ate tomatoes, you would die.
There was a guy that got up in
public and ate a bunch of

16
00:02:26,292 --> 00:02:32,833
tomatoes, and he didn't die. So
everybody thought he would die,
and there was a sharp intake of

17
00:02:32,833 --> 00:02:38,083
breath from the audience. He
didn't do, and after that
everybody knew you could eat

18
00:02:38,083 --> 00:02:52,167
tomatoes. For a long time, for
100 years phone companies around
the world have kind of created a

19
00:02:52,167 --> 00:02:59,250
culture for themselves that is
very cooperative with
governments in invading people's

20
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:10,750
privacy. So these phone
companies tend to think that
there's no other way. That they

21
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:21,792
can't break from that culture.
That tomatoes are poisonous. And
my company, Silent Circle is

22
00:03:21,792 --> 00:03:30,708
working with a company in
Holland, the Dutch carrier, and
Jay who been to a lot of DEF

23
00:03:30,708 --> 00:03:42,250
CON's is the CISO there. I've
known Jane for about 12 years or
so. She decided that she wanted

24
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:49,917
to break ranks from the rest of
the phone companies and get KPN
to offer their customers

25
00:03:49,917 --> 00:03:58,458
privacy, to offer their
customers phone calls that are
private, that KPN can't

26
00:03:58,458 --> 00:04:11,042
wire‑tap. So she is coming to us
Silent Circle to her her do
that. Actually she contacted me

27
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:19,375
to speak at an event and told me
she was involved in the new
start‑up. She didn't hear about

28
00:04:19,375 --> 00:04:25,708
it. She looked at the website
and got all enthusiastic and
persuaded all the management of

29
00:04:25,708 --> 00:04:33,792
her company to pursue this. So
we have a nice relationship with
KPN now. For the first time you

30
00:04:33,792 --> 00:04:42,583
see a phone company offering its
customers real privacy. So the
people can call each other, so

31
00:04:42,583 --> 00:04:49,292
the people can whisper in each
other's ears from far away
without anyone intercepting that

32
00:04:49,292 --> 00:04:57,500
conversation. And so my hope is
that other phone companies will
discover that these tomatoes are

33
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:02,792
not poisonous and will follow
suit. We have a lot of other
phone companies that are talking

34
00:05:02,792 --> 00:05:11,958
with us about doing the same
thing. So I hope we will see a
change here. Quite a bit is

35
00:05:11,958 --> 00:05:16,000
motivated by the revolution
creating market demand. There's
generally more market awareness

36
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:25,042
that it's time for a change, and
the phone companies are feeling
market pressure for this. So we

37
00:05:25,042 --> 00:05:29,417
have a way of doing this, and
we're working with a lot of
phone companies to bring it

38
00:05:29,417 --> 00:05:41,917
about. So I think that we may
find a future where phone
companies, a lot of phone

39
00:05:41,917 --> 00:05:46,833
companies help people have
private phone calls. That will
be ‑‑ that will break a

40
00:05:46,833 --> 00:05:59,125
100‑year‑old culture for all the
phone companies in the world.
( Applause ) >>So, anyway, we

41
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:08,500
had this cool startup called
Silent Circle and it started
when I got a call from a guy who

42
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:15,833
wanted me to help him start a
company. This guy is a Navy SEAL
and he wanted to start a company

43
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:24,250
that would allow US servicemen
overseas to talk with their
families back home, because it

44
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:32,833
wan't easy to do. The Pentagon
just told them what NOT to do,
but didn't have good advice on

45
00:06:32,833 --> 00:06:42,542
what TO do. So he wanted to give
them something for that, and he
described it to me. I thought,

46
00:06:42,542 --> 00:06:46,875
yeah, sure. I've been working
for many years on the Z‑phone
project and demoed Z‑phone at

47
00:06:46,875 --> 00:06:57,167
DEF CON a couple of times. I
thought, sure, I'm in. So we
started this company. I reached

48
00:06:57,167 --> 00:07:05,250
out to my friend John, a CEO at
PGP. He was working at Apple and
later worked for EndTrust. I

49
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:15,292
thought we could get this done.
Now we've got the company that
has grown quite a bit. We're up

50
00:07:15,292 --> 00:07:23,042
to around 100 people now. We've
got customers that ‑‑ we have
three groups of customers,

51
00:07:23,042 --> 00:07:30,208
enterprise customers, government
customers and consumers. Anybody
can sign up for our service. The

52
00:07:30,208 --> 00:07:39,292
government customers include
Navy S.E.A.L.s. Navy S.E.A.L.s
that are actually using it for

53
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:49,583
operations. So we're using ‑‑
we're selling to special
operations forces in Canada,

54
00:07:49,583 --> 00:07:57,000
Britain, Australia, the United
States. U.S. Congress uses it.
Other parts of the government

55
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:04,333
use it. We see law enforcement
use it. We had about a year ago
a visit from the FBI at our

56
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:12,042
office, and my business partner
called me and told me the FBI
was in the office today. I said,

57
00:08:12,042 --> 00:08:20,458
oh, no, it's starting already.
He said, no, no. They just were
here to ask about pricing.

58
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:30,458
( Laughter ) I thought, okay,
that's it. We're winning this.
One of the first things that

59
00:08:30,458 --> 00:08:37,750
happen when had Mike approached
me was that I wanted to make it
so that politically ‑‑ I mean, I

60
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:46,750
have a lot of experience in the
1990s fighting the cryptowars,
so I have some instinct to

61
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:57,917
create public policy. We need to
create conditions where
everybody is going to lean on us

62
00:08:57,917 --> 00:09:02,333
to put a back door in because
they need it themselves. If Navy
S.E.A.L.s are using it, if our

63
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:12,958
own government develops a
dependency on it, they recognize
it's counter‑productive for them

64
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:21,083
to try to get a back door on the
product. Now, maybe it was an
overabundance of caution because

65
00:09:21,083 --> 00:09:29,708
they never asked for a back door
at PGP, but that took years to
get propagated out to government

66
00:09:29,708 --> 00:09:36,125
customers. We saw government
customers take it as soon as the
product was ready. As soon as

67
00:09:36,125 --> 00:09:41,792
the product was ready, they were
asking about it. A lot of that
has to do with Mike's contacts

68
00:09:41,792 --> 00:09:49,250
from that community and so we
created conditions where it's
difficult for them to even bring

69
00:09:49,250 --> 00:10:07,417
up the subject of the back door.
They won't. This is effective in
the 1990s with the course code

70
00:10:07,417 --> 00:10:17,625
in books and have them scanned
in in Europe using OCR fonts and
CRCs on every kind of Morse code

71
00:10:17,625 --> 00:10:23,667
and have them scanned in and
turned into the binaries. That
blew a hole in the export

72
00:10:23,667 --> 00:10:32,167
controls in the 1990s. So we're
doing the same thing again here.
We're creating secure phone

73
00:10:32,167 --> 00:10:40,458
technology that it depends on
and other governments around the
world. So we think we can bring

74
00:10:40,458 --> 00:10:45,958
this into the mainstream. It
will be possible for you to
whisper in someone's ear from

75
00:10:45,958 --> 00:10:55,208
1,000 miles away, and it will
become the new normal. You know,
most of these talks have

76
00:10:55,208 --> 00:11:02,958
questions at the end, but being
as how this is DEF CON and just
the culture of DEF CON, I kind

77
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:09,708
of feel like getting a few
questions in the middle. If
anybody wants to raise some

78
00:11:09,708 --> 00:11:18,375
questions, I'd like to hear
them. Yeah. >> How do you expect
U.S. cell phone companies to

79
00:11:18,375 --> 00:11:29,792
survive with the way that Qwest
was bankrupted by the government
for not cooperating with it? >>

80
00:11:29,792 --> 00:11:39,208
I don't know all the details of
what led to Qwest's problems,
and I would assume that there

81
00:11:39,208 --> 00:11:45,083
were other ‑‑ that there were
other elements to that. We're
not going after U.S. cell phone

82
00:11:45,083 --> 00:11:49,542
carriers right now. We're going
after European ones and other
ones are in other parts of the

83
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:59,917
world. After we get a lot of
those, we can have a look at the
U.S. carriers. >> My question is

84
00:11:59,917 --> 00:12:08,125
about the metadata. They might
not know the details of about
what you saying but the systems

85
00:12:08,125 --> 00:12:16,667
you composing stop people from
gathering metadata from people
you're talking to? >> They could

86
00:12:16,667 --> 00:12:26,917
get metadata if they watch all
the data. They can figure out
new time correlations, here's

87
00:12:26,917 --> 00:12:32,125
some packets coming from this
direction and here's packets
going out to that direction and

88
00:12:32,125 --> 00:12:39,458
probably they're related. You
know, we don't actually store
any logs. We don't keep call

89
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:48,625
records for end‑to‑end secure
calls, so they can't ask us for
the metadata. In places where we

90
00:12:48,625 --> 00:12:58,208
connect to the public switch
telephone network, they can
wiretap and get that for that.

91
00:12:58,208 --> 00:13:06,458
Those are carriers that deliver
the parts of it. For end‑to‑end
secure calls, we don't keep any

92
00:13:06,458 --> 00:13:15,625
logs of that. >> Being that
Silent Circle is one of the few
commercials, do you think

93
00:13:15,625 --> 00:13:24,000
there's an external force
preventing the option for the
aggression of the PGP in terms

94
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:38,417
of security technology? That
external force possibly being
the government or any other

95
00:13:38,417 --> 00:13:42,125
group that doesn't necessarily
want to make sure it succeeds?
>> PGP has been used for 20

96
00:13:42,125 --> 00:13:46,167
years by a lot of people in a
lot of companies. We don't have
the security of the service at

97
00:13:46,167 --> 00:13:52,083
this time. We did have something
at the beginning of the company,
but we closed that down because

98
00:13:52,083 --> 00:14:02,583
they closed theirs down because
they came under pressure and
they got a court order that

99
00:14:02,583 --> 00:14:08,083
demanded that they hand over
some things we didn't want to be
put in the same position. So we

100
00:14:08,083 --> 00:14:14,000
closed down our security mail
service because e‑mail was a
different thing than phone

101
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:19,042
calls. Phone calms are a
ephemeral thing. There's no need
to keep any records. With e‑mail

102
00:14:19,042 --> 00:14:25,125
you have to keep the e‑mail
around on a server somewhere,
and the e‑mail has meta data. It

103
00:14:25,125 --> 00:14:35,167
has a from and to and a subject
line. All those things have to
be stored on a server. So that's

104
00:14:35,167 --> 00:14:43,208
metadata that invites, you know,
a court order to have a look at
it. In the case of that, they

105
00:14:43,208 --> 00:14:49,167
wanted more than that. They
wanted some aids. We didn't want
to be put in that position. So

106
00:14:49,167 --> 00:15:01,667
we wiped out ‑‑ destructively
wiped out in a few hours our
entire security mail service. We

107
00:15:01,667 --> 00:15:08,458
went down everything and did it
without warning without telling
our customers because we didn't

108
00:15:08,458 --> 00:15:16,042
want to be next. When the
customers were pissed off about
that, but most of them respected

109
00:15:16,042 --> 00:15:26,083
our reasons for doing it. They
recognized that we did it to
preserve their records. >> Does

110
00:15:26,083 --> 00:15:31,750
it make sense that you work for
Silent Circle the adoption of
PGP and the fact we don't see a

111
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:40,333
lot of PGP into the different
technologies. >> You recent you
don't see PGP used ubiquitously

112
00:15:40,333 --> 00:15:48,208
is because it's necessary for
people to understand how it
works. They have to understand

113
00:15:48,208 --> 00:15:55,333
trust models and public
infrastructure. They have to
understand what it means to have

114
00:15:55,333 --> 00:16:02,375
public and private keys that are
persistent and last and have to
be managed. You have to know

115
00:16:02,375 --> 00:16:07,958
that a name goes with a key.
Those are complicated things
that we don't have to worry

116
00:16:07,958 --> 00:16:14,458
about when we make ephemeral
phone calls. The way we do phone
calls, the ZRTP protocol that

117
00:16:14,458 --> 00:16:21,000
was the basis for Z‑phone ‑‑ how
many people in here have seen my
old Z‑phone demos in previous

118
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:29,333
DEF CONs? I guess everyone is so
young, they don't think about
that far. How many people here

119
00:16:29,333 --> 00:16:41,417
didn't know how to use computers
back whether PGP was causing so
much trouble in the '90s? Yeah?

120
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:52,958
A lot of young whippersnappers.
Okay. PGP has more complexity
than a protocol that does secure

121
00:16:52,958 --> 00:17:03,250
phone calls. With the protocol
we have now, the keys are made
with an exchange. They're

122
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:08,375
discarded at the end of the
call, and so you don't have
to ‑‑ I don't have to have a

123
00:17:08,375 --> 00:17:16,417
public infrastructure. I think
public hand restructures are
generally a bad idea. If you can

124
00:17:16,417 --> 00:17:21,708
avoid them, that's a good idea
to move away. In fact, what we
do to prevent a man in the

125
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:29,500
middle is we verbally compare
the hash of the session. The
other person has it displayed on

126
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:36,500
their screen. You have it
displayed on your screen and
compare them following it and

127
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:40,500
use your voice and brain and
ears and common sense to see if
they match. If they match

128
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:44,333
everything is fine. If they
don't match, there's a
wiretapper. There's a man in the

129
00:17:44,333 --> 00:17:51,375
middle, because if there is no
man in the middle, then Alice
and Bob are both using the same

130
00:17:51,375 --> 00:17:57,000
session. If you take that
session and display it on the
screen it's going to be the same

131
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,250
hash. If there was a man in the
middle how is this connected to
the man in the middle with a

132
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:09,792
different session key than the
other connection between the man
in the middle and Bob. If you

133
00:18:09,792 --> 00:18:18,750
display that hash on the screen,
they aren't going to match, so
you have detected the man in the

134
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:22,833
middle. It's kind of crude. It's
kind of stupid. That's what
makes it so simple and

135
00:18:22,833 --> 00:18:29,458
foolproof. It peens ‑‑ means we
don't have to rely on a
infrastructure or certificate

136
00:18:29,458 --> 00:18:36,583
authority. Remember that some
years ago there was a
certificate authority in Holland

137
00:18:36,583 --> 00:18:45,125
that their master signing key
was stolen by an Iranian hacker.
The Iranian hacker used it to

138
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:52,000
forge hundreds of certificates
for things like Gmail and
Facebook. Then he gave bogus

139
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:58,375
certificates to the Iranian
regime, and then they used them
to do man in the middle attacks

140
00:18:58,375 --> 00:19:08,208
on thousands of Iranian
dissidents and arrested them. It
would be hard to imagine a more

141
00:19:08,208 --> 00:19:14,458
spectacular failure of public
infrastructure than that. If you
were writing fiction, you

142
00:19:14,458 --> 00:19:20,750
couldn't concoct a more
spectacular indictment of public
infrastructure than that

143
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:29,667
example. So that's why we don't
use a public restructure to
protect our phone calls. We

144
00:19:29,667 --> 00:19:37,792
don't depend on them. We too our
key exchange media there because
when I designed ZRTV I designed

145
00:19:37,792 --> 00:19:44,542
it to not trust the phone
company. I regarded the phone
companies as not your friend

146
00:19:44,542 --> 00:19:54,625
because of the aforementioned
100‑year culture history where
you wiretap, sometimes even over

147
00:19:54,625 --> 00:20:02,833
complying. I didn't regard them
at your friend, so I designed
the protocol to not share any

148
00:20:02,833 --> 00:20:08,042
keys with the phone company. We
do it through the media. The
signaling is generally under the

149
00:20:08,042 --> 00:20:14,583
control of the phone company or
the service provider. The media
goes directly between Alice and

150
00:20:14,583 --> 00:20:22,792
Bob from your smartphone to the
other smartphone. This protocol
is designed to negotiate the

151
00:20:22,792 --> 00:20:30,500
keys through the media there. We
will share them with the service
provider, and in this case

152
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:35,500
Silent Circle is the service
provider. So if we're using a
protocol call years later,

153
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:39,083
little did I realize that years
later I would actually run a
service provider that I design

154
00:20:39,083 --> 00:20:50,750
as protocol not to trust. So you
don't have to trust Silent
Circle. The protocol is designed

155
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:56,458
so that you don't have to trust.
We publish our source code, of
course. Every project I'm

156
00:20:56,458 --> 00:21:03,333
involved with, there's always a
source code. You can see that
the clients do what they say

157
00:21:03,333 --> 00:21:08,875
they do, and even if they were
seized by the NSA and carted off
to Fort Mead, they would not get

158
00:21:08,875 --> 00:21:16,250
the contents of your phone
calls. Maybe we should let them
do that. Then we wouldn't have

159
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:23,083
to pay the electricity. It's
hard to tell who is calling who.
They can do that now if they

160
00:21:23,083 --> 00:21:35,083
monitor the entire Internet. You
can figure out by correlating
this traffic business is active

161
00:21:35,083 --> 00:21:42,333
at the same time. These two
people must be talking to each
other. If you're in a place like

162
00:21:42,333 --> 00:21:49,583
Pakistan and you want to call
somebody in some other part of
the world, the Pakistani

163
00:21:49,583 --> 00:21:56,042
intelligence is not going to
know who you're talking to. All
the calls, all the signaling

164
00:21:56,042 --> 00:22:02,667
would go through our servers.
The media would be, you know,
going out of Pakistan in that

165
00:22:02,667 --> 00:22:15,417
form. Yeah, right there. You
have to yell really loud. By the
way, there's people standing at

166
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:21,625
line at the microphones. I
should probably do that. We'll
just go with this question.

167
00:22:21,625 --> 00:22:36,208
( Inaudible question ) >> The
question is when we shut down
our e‑mail service, we started

168
00:22:36,208 --> 00:22:40,917
an initiative to do a secure
e‑mail service built on a
different architecture called

169
00:22:40,917 --> 00:22:53,167
dark mail. You know, since that
time we've had crazy growth in
other areas, and it has taken up

170
00:22:53,167 --> 00:23:01,667
a lot of engineering. So I don't
really have that much to say
about dark mail right now, but,

171
00:23:01,667 --> 00:23:08,375
you know, if anybody wants to
hear more about that, they can
talk to John, our CEO. He's more

172
00:23:08,375 --> 00:23:22,333
intune to what we're doing on
dark mail. ( Inaudible
question ) >> Yeah. The question

173
00:23:22,333 --> 00:23:41,167
is what kind of cryptosuites are
we using? After the revelation,
we felt a bit resentful, that

174
00:23:41,167 --> 00:23:47,917
NIST cooperated with the NSA.
To express our displeasure we
offered alternative algorithms

175
00:23:47,917 --> 00:23:55,833
that you can elect to use in
this one. In fact, we even made
the other algorithms the

176
00:23:55,833 --> 00:24:09,208
default. We have a new elliptic
curve we commissioned Bernstein
to do for us. We used 2fish as

177
00:24:09,208 --> 00:24:13,875
the blocker. We use scaneas our
hash function. These are
alternatives to these choices.

178
00:24:13,875 --> 00:24:18,250
Now, I don't believe there's
anything wrong with these
choices. We're not using this

179
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:21,333
stupid random number generator
to the NSA. I can't imagine why
anybody would use such a stupid

180
00:24:21,333 --> 00:24:32,250
number. Apparently RSA did. They
were just a closed source. It's
funny, you know, back in the

181
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:40,833
'90s when RSA started the
criminal investigation against
me when calling up the

182
00:24:40,833 --> 00:24:52,958
prosecutor and asking to put me
in prison, they said that RSA
was the most trusted name in

183
00:24:52,958 --> 00:24:58,333
cryptography. They even
complained because we had said
that about PGP, and in some

184
00:24:58,333 --> 00:25:02,708
press interview. We were just
saying it as kind of statement
much fact rather than a

185
00:25:02,708 --> 00:25:06,875
marketing slogan, and they sent
us a nasty letter saying we
can't see that PGP is the most

186
00:25:06,875 --> 00:25:13,208
trusted name in cryptography
because that's a trademark of
RSA. They wanted up to cease and

187
00:25:13,208 --> 00:25:28,000
desist saying that was their
trademark. It's ironic that
today we find they were paid $10

188
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:39,917
million to put an NSA‑designed
random number generator in
there. Anyway, we don't use

189
00:25:39,917 --> 00:25:47,875
that. What we do use ‑‑ we do
use other NIST algorithms that
are good algorithms. There's

190
00:25:47,875 --> 00:25:53,583
nothing with them. We offer
those as a choice. We can use
them, or you can use the new

191
00:25:53,583 --> 00:26:00,292
ones. We default to the new
ones. It wasn't because there
was anything actually wrong

192
00:26:00,292 --> 00:26:14,167
within those that we were using.
Over here. Hi. >> Traditional
cell phones are dependent on the

193
00:26:14,167 --> 00:26:25,625
baseband processor. What are you
doing to mitigate the processor?
>> That's a good question. You

194
00:26:25,625 --> 00:26:30,042
know, we had a meeting and
video. The video makes the chip
using the phone. Nvidia acquired

195
00:26:30,042 --> 00:26:46,542
the company that made that. So I
asked them that question. I said
can we do an independent

196
00:26:46,542 --> 00:26:54,667
security review of the firmware
for the processor. They were
open to that. In fact, they were

197
00:26:54,667 --> 00:27:02,125
delighted to have a customer
express an interest in taking a
close look at the processor. No

198
00:27:02,125 --> 00:27:09,500
other customer had ever brought
up the question before. You
know, no other customer is as

199
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:15,875
obsessive about them as we are.
So actually what I like to do is
I'd like to figure out a way to

200
00:27:15,875 --> 00:27:21,583
decouple the processor so it
doesn't have read-write access
to the application in the

201
00:27:21,583 --> 00:27:30,458
processor's memory. I think that
there may be ways to do that.
I've hear that some of these

202
00:27:30,458 --> 00:27:40,167
processors are decoupled and you
can talk them through 18
minutes. If that's the case,

203
00:27:40,167 --> 00:27:51,208
then that would be a better way
to go. We'll keep pursuing that
with Nvidia, and we'll always be

204
00:27:51,208 --> 00:28:04,875
pursuing them. We started with
black phone. It's kind of a
journey. We have to work hard to

205
00:28:04,875 --> 00:28:08,542
take all the pieces and make
them all secure one by one. >>
Do you have what processes in

206
00:28:08,542 --> 00:28:15,750
the phone has access to?
Traditionally you have access to
that. Does that affect it? >> I

207
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:22,292
don't know what the baseband
processor has access to. I think
you have to talk to Mike

208
00:28:22,292 --> 00:28:29,625
Kershaw, the CTO of Black Phone.
I'll raise that question with
him. It's about things relating

209
00:28:29,625 --> 00:28:44,708
to the base processor. Yeah. >>
How do we make the solutions (
Inaudible ) make the anomaly for

210
00:28:44,708 --> 00:28:51,875
further NALGSZ analysis and
scrutiny. >> That's a good
question. I don't think that's

211
00:28:51,875 --> 00:28:59,708
about just Silent Circle but the
whole message about crypto. Look
at the legislative environment

212
00:28:59,708 --> 00:29:09,667
today. During the 1990s you had
to defend yourself and justify
why you were using strong

213
00:29:09,667 --> 00:29:26,667
crypto. Why? Are you a drug
dealer. A child pornographer? A
terrorist? Justify it. That was

214
00:29:26,667 --> 00:29:34,625
the mindset that we faced in the
1990s when we began fighting the
cryptowars. If you fast forward

215
00:29:34,625 --> 00:29:38,875
to today, we're in a legislative
environment that's turned on its
head. We now have to justify

216
00:29:38,875 --> 00:29:50,042
ourselves if we're not in strong
crypto. If you are a doctor or a
medical institution, you're

217
00:29:50,042 --> 00:30:00,958
required to destroy crypto to
protect patient records. If
you're a company and leave your

218
00:30:00,958 --> 00:30:05,417
laptop computer in a taxi with
200,000 customer names on the
disk, you better hope to God

219
00:30:05,417 --> 00:30:13,667
that disk is encrypted. If it's
not, you have to go public and
announce you lost 200,000

220
00:30:13,667 --> 00:30:21,667
customer names. The legislative
environment has been turned
around. Sarbanes Oxley requires

221
00:30:21,667 --> 00:30:28,500
to protect to company assets,
and that it doesn't explicitly
mention crypto. Everybody knows

222
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:35,792
you need that to do that.
There's all kinds of legislative
things in the environment today

223
00:30:35,792 --> 00:30:46,417
we didn't have in the 90's, the
environment now today to justify
that. >> The current version of

224
00:30:46,417 --> 00:30:58,000
the information of freedom act
mandates that phone companies
now do the bulk metadata

225
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:08,167
collection that NSA used to do,
understanding that some phones
are simply different, I wonder

226
00:31:08,167 --> 00:31:15,000
if you can comment on the
current freedom of information
act? How does that offer that?

227
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:27,042
>> All of these other laws that
impose requirements on phone
companies are largely imposing

228
00:31:27,042 --> 00:31:31,542
requirements on phone companies.
They don't impose requirements
on any users. Now, the ZRTP

229
00:31:31,542 --> 00:31:36,708
protocol performs its
calculations in the client
software, which is owned by the

230
00:31:36,708 --> 00:31:45,375
end user. And so we're not in
violation of that as a service
provider if KALIA requires us to

231
00:31:45,375 --> 00:31:52,042
hand over what we have to the
government. Well, we don't have
any keys, and we can't hand them

232
00:31:52,042 --> 00:31:59,625
over if we don't have them. So I
don't think that the legislative
initiatives that we might see

233
00:31:59,625 --> 00:32:04,625
are going to have that much
effect unless they try to go
back and say that people are not

234
00:32:04,625 --> 00:32:10,375
allowed to use strong
C.R.Y.P.T.O. I just don't see
that happening. We fought and

235
00:32:10,375 --> 00:32:19,500
won in the 1990s in the
cryptowars. After 9/11 I thought
someone would roll them back,

236
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:25,333
but they did not. It was kind of
interesting. On 9/11 our
attorney general was John

237
00:32:25,333 --> 00:32:33,792
Ashcroft. During the 1990s, he
was a senator during the Clinton
years. I met with John Ashcroft

238
00:32:33,792 --> 00:32:45,333
along with other activists, he
was convinced that we were
right, that we needed to change

239
00:32:45,333 --> 00:32:52,208
the export controls. We needed
to not pursue the clipper chip.
So he was on our side. Later he

240
00:32:52,208 --> 00:32:59,500
became attorney general and did
not change his position. So even
though we lost a lot of other

241
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:05,625
civil liberties under John
Ashcroft, he didn't try to roll
back the gains that we had won

242
00:33:05,625 --> 00:33:17,750
in the 1990s. Yeah. >> You
mentioned that you now
publish ‑‑ I'm sorry. I was

243
00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:22,042
pointing to a guy in the front
row. You really should stand in
line back there. If you yell

244
00:33:22,042 --> 00:33:33,917
really loud, I can hear you.
( Inaudible question ) How do we
do what we can do without PK

245
00:33:33,917 --> 00:33:45,500
infrastructure. >> We verbally
compare the session. How do you
awe then indicate that partner?

246
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:54,875
We send our signaling through a
TLS tunnel. We have a public key
infrastructure there, but not

247
00:33:54,875 --> 00:33:58,208
from a certificate authority of
the we put a public key
certificate in the client and we

248
00:33:58,208 --> 00:34:05,667
bake it into the client. There
is no ‑‑ it doesn't depend on
certification by a certificate

249
00:34:05,667 --> 00:34:11,417
authority. We actually do have a
certificate authority sign it,
but we don't care because we

250
00:34:11,417 --> 00:34:19,167
bake the key into the client.
You're supposed to know who
you're talking to. If you don't

251
00:34:19,167 --> 00:34:25,917
know who you're talking to, then
you might have other problems
because, you know, it's not our

252
00:34:25,917 --> 00:34:32,375
job to guarantee that the person
that you're conspiring with is
actually the person you know, or

253
00:34:32,375 --> 00:34:42,417
is it an I am impostor? >> Yeah.
>> You mentioned that you public
publish all your source code,

254
00:34:42,417 --> 00:34:51,458
and we can look and see if the
client is doing what it's
supposed to be doing. You have

255
00:34:51,458 --> 00:34:57,917
this great system where you
display that on the screen so
that we don't have it and know

256
00:34:57,917 --> 00:35:07,125
the back end is doing what it's
supposed to do. How can I verify
that the actual binary running

257
00:35:07,125 --> 00:35:11,958
on my phone was built from that
source? >> Well, you have to
compile it yourself and see if

258
00:35:11,958 --> 00:35:16,917
it was ‑‑ if it's the same. It's
not so easy, though, because,
you know, modern development

259
00:35:16,917 --> 00:35:22,292
environments have so much
complexity. They might have time
stamps in the binaries, for

260
00:35:22,292 --> 00:35:28,458
example. It might be hard to do
that. What you can do is compile
it yourself and run it and use

261
00:35:28,458 --> 00:35:37,542
what you run yourself. If you're
on Android, that's easy to do.
On Apple devices, not so easy,

262
00:35:37,542 --> 00:35:45,333
because you have to be an Apple
developer. I don't know if you
can really compare the binaries

263
00:35:45,333 --> 00:35:53,042
because I don't know if you can
make a fresh binary if it's
really been at the same ‑‑ all

264
00:35:53,042 --> 00:36:11,333
the bits all the time. It's the
best we can do. >> You know, one
thing I'd like to say is that we

265
00:36:11,333 --> 00:36:15,208
all ‑‑ I get a lot of people
asking me about how hopeless the
surveillance society is, the

266
00:36:15,208 --> 00:36:22,375
pervasive surveillance. I feel
like if we feel it's hopeless,
we're less likely to do

267
00:36:22,375 --> 00:36:31,750
something about it. It's a
paralyzing effect. I'd like to
point out there's a lot of times

268
00:36:31,750 --> 00:36:39,917
in history, we faced very
difficult problems that seemed
hopeless when we couldn't solve

269
00:36:39,917 --> 00:36:46,000
them, and yet we did. There was
a time when slavery was an
entrenched institution with

270
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:52,750
powerful money interests behind
it and we're seemingly so
entrenched there would be no

271
00:36:52,750 --> 00:36:59,208
hope to change it. Yet, we did
get rid of slavery not just in
the U.S. but pretty much the

272
00:36:59,208 --> 00:37:08,583
rest of the world. There was
also a time when we had the
nuclear arms race. That seemed

273
00:37:08,583 --> 00:37:13,625
to be something we can never
change. We were facing a global
nuclear holocaust, and somehow

274
00:37:13,625 --> 00:37:22,792
the arms race came to an end.
The American civil rights
movement seemed to be a very

275
00:37:22,792 --> 00:37:32,917
difficult problem in the 1950s
and '60s and yet, we made great
progress there. Going back

276
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:37,375
further in history, there was a
Divine Right of Kings. A king
could just chop your head off,

277
00:37:37,375 --> 00:37:44,542
and we managed to move past that
globally. We came up with
western democracies with

278
00:37:44,542 --> 00:37:51,458
constitutions and parliaments.
Even if they had kings, they
were just ‑‑ they were

279
00:37:51,458 --> 00:37:59,083
constitutional monarchies where
the king couldn't chop your head
off anymore. We managed to solve

280
00:37:59,083 --> 00:38:05,667
a lot of problems that seemed to
be insolvable. I think that what
we face today with the pervasive

281
00:38:05,667 --> 00:38:12,833
surveillance at this moment
seemed to be an insolvable
problem, but I disagree. I think

282
00:38:12,833 --> 00:38:19,083
like many other solvable
problems before, seemingly
insolvable problems before, we

283
00:38:19,083 --> 00:38:24,417
found a way to get past it. I
think we can do that now. I
think that if we deploy

284
00:38:24,417 --> 00:38:30,417
technology like Silent Circle
and push back on policy space
and try to change the laws and,

285
00:38:30,417 --> 00:38:36,583
in fact, these two things are
related because sometimes you
can change the laws by deploying

286
00:38:36,583 --> 00:38:43,500
technology and having it become
the new norm. This creates
public expectations that make it

287
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:50,333
unthinkable to have laws that
intrude upon what everybody has
gotten used to. When you do

288
00:38:50,333 --> 00:38:59,333
online banking today, you use
SSL. If government tried to say,
well, all the connections

289
00:38:59,333 --> 00:39:05,083
through web browsers having to
go through a government proxy,
you can't talk to your bank

290
00:39:05,083 --> 00:39:08,542
anymore without the government
seeing the conversation with
your bank, people would reject

291
00:39:08,542 --> 00:39:19,000
that. The new norm is that we
have pervasive crypto. So we
need to create pervasive phone

292
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:26,083
calls that are encrypted to make
that the new norm, and then this
will cause the legislative

293
00:39:26,083 --> 00:39:33,417
environment to change and push
back. What's happened with
the ‑‑ the reason we won in the

294
00:39:33,417 --> 00:39:47,667
1990s is we got everybody to
participate in a big public
policy debate. We won. We got

295
00:39:47,667 --> 00:39:51,042
the export controls turned back.
We got the domestic controls.
There was the clipper chip. We

296
00:39:51,042 --> 00:39:59,042
killed those before they could
get any traction. I think we can
do the same thing here. Yeah. >>

297
00:39:59,042 --> 00:40:08,000
I just wondered what license
this source code is released
under. >> It's some kind of a ‑‑

298
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:15,667
I'm not sure. It might be either
a GPL or some special license
that allows you to do things

299
00:40:15,667 --> 00:40:22,000
with it. But I think that you're
not allowed to make money with
it. I'm not sure of the terms.

300
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:27,750
You got to the Silent Circle
website and read the fine print
of the license. The ZRPT

301
00:40:27,750 --> 00:40:35,375
protocol has an open source
license, LGPL, which is a
reasonable open source license.

302
00:40:35,375 --> 00:40:40,958
People can use that to create
other products. There are other
ZRPT products out there. Yeah.

303
00:40:40,958 --> 00:40:52,500
>> On the subject of making
secured communications more
ubiquitous, one of the things is

304
00:40:52,500 --> 00:41:02,458
to make emergency services
available in a secure way. Given
your thoughts on the challenge

305
00:41:02,458 --> 00:41:08,458
of PKIN for structure with a
nontechnical public, we have to
start securing things around the

306
00:41:08,458 --> 00:41:13,958
media channel like location,
determination, location
validation and index generation

307
00:41:13,958 --> 00:41:21,958
we pass in the eyes to help
records like that. What do you
see in opportunities to make

308
00:41:21,958 --> 00:41:29,208
that work in a way that still
allows us to have secured
communications? >> It's an

309
00:41:29,208 --> 00:41:33,708
interesting question, because
this ‑‑ as you described that I
remember the terrible

310
00:41:33,708 --> 00:41:40,667
frustration of calling 911
because my house is on fire, and
I'm getting a certificate that's

311
00:41:40,667 --> 00:41:52,250
expired. With a little alert box
that tells me that it's expired.
What a nightmare that would be.

312
00:41:52,250 --> 00:42:01,667
Reminds me of a scene in the old
original terminator move.
Somebody calls 911 and gets a

313
00:42:01,667 --> 00:42:08,000
recording that says all lines
are busy right now. You never
get that when you call 911, but

314
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:21,333
it was a great device in a move
to, you know ‑‑ great plot
device in the movie. Whatever we

315
00:42:21,333 --> 00:42:28,708
do is if it isn't working how it
should, it's out the of the way.
Right now nobody cares about

316
00:42:28,708 --> 00:42:42,250
encrypting the calls to 911. If
we encrypt the calls, it's nice
to do that. If there's a reason

317
00:42:42,250 --> 00:42:56,583
why the fucking PKI doesn't
work, I want to talk to fucking
911 regardless. You have to fall

318
00:42:56,583 --> 00:43:04,875
back on unencrypted keys you
don't care about because you
want an ambulance to get here

319
00:43:04,875 --> 00:43:14,458
right now. I've heard people say
that like in silent phone that
you can't negotiate keys for

320
00:43:14,458 --> 00:43:20,625
some reason, like maybe if
somebody is ‑‑ if somebody has
done something bad to the

321
00:43:20,625 --> 00:43:27,542
servers, and the servers fall
under the control of the evil
NSA that hacks in and turns off

322
00:43:27,542 --> 00:43:47,125
TLS, so the signaling can't do
TLS, we should find a way to
make the quality of it better.

323
00:43:47,125 --> 00:43:52,250
If we actually start to use it
for emergency services, we
should definitely find a way to

324
00:43:52,250 --> 00:43:57,250
get around it and make a call no
matter what. Any kind of thing
that involves emergency services

325
00:43:57,250 --> 00:44:02,417
to make an unencrypted call is
necessary. You can display that
the call is not encrypted. How

326
00:44:02,417 --> 00:44:08,125
do you make a GUI all over the
world in 30 different languages
and make the users understand

327
00:44:08,125 --> 00:44:14,125
what the security statement is.
It's not an easy thing to do.
With Z‑phone and with the first

328
00:44:14,125 --> 00:44:22,125
versions of Silent Phone in
English, now we're kind of
struggling with trying to deal

329
00:44:22,125 --> 00:44:32,083
with doing it in 30 languages or
doing it graphically. Yeah.
Okay. It's five minutes to go.

330
00:44:32,083 --> 00:44:36,417
Got a question. Go ahead. >> I
take it you saw the news this
week that Yahoo! is bumping up

331
00:44:36,417 --> 00:44:54,458
it up for companies that are
offering it. I wanted to know
who is doing that? >> Say that

332
00:44:54,458 --> 00:44:58,000
again. >> Did you see the news
this week that Yahoo! Is bumping
up in search results those

333
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:03,458
websites that are like that? >>
Yeah, yeah. >> What do you think
of Yahoo! with the Internet

334
00:45:03,458 --> 00:45:08,125
values? >> You know, when they
started the company, Yahoo! They
didn't found it with a motto of

335
00:45:08,125 --> 00:45:14,500
don't be evil. Yet, they seem to
be very interested in not being
evil. So that's inspiring. >>

336
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:24,458
I'm glad that they're doing it.
What you see here is all of this
kind of a technical TRON in this

337
00:45:24,458 --> 00:45:28,292
case shift because of what we
saw with Snowden's revelations.
Everybody in the security

338
00:45:28,292 --> 00:45:34,792
industry is trying to up their
game. I think that's why phone
companies are interested in

339
00:45:34,792 --> 00:45:39,542
working with us, because they're
feeling a lot of pressure from
their user base. So I think that

340
00:45:39,542 --> 00:45:54,708
the time has come now that we
now have the wind at our backs
with market pressure. We have a

341
00:45:54,708 --> 00:45:58,750
lot of motivated security people
that are finally able too get
traction with their own

342
00:45:58,750 --> 00:46:06,375
employers to, you know, get
everything heightened up. We see
products everywhere try to up

343
00:46:06,375 --> 00:46:20,958
their game is services. The
entire purpose of Black Phone is
to make a phone. It's not a

344
00:46:20,958 --> 00:46:30,250
Android phone with privacy
features. Everything we do with
it is all about protecting your

345
00:46:30,250 --> 00:46:35,833
privacy. It's not just silent
phone but everything else on the
phone. I've been working on

346
00:46:35,833 --> 00:46:48,833
crypto software for a long time.
What if somebody breaks into the
platform? If it's out of school

347
00:46:48,833 --> 00:46:58,000
with my software, I can't
control this. I can't operate on
a clean execution platform, then

348
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:03,500
we can't make any security
guarantees. Steve Jobs said if
you want to do a good operating

349
00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:07,417
system, you have to build it
around your hardware. That's
what we're doing now, we're

350
00:47:07,417 --> 00:47:12,792
building our own hardware. We're
being a purposeful phone whose
purpose is to give you privacy.

351
00:47:12,792 --> 00:47:29,792
We're hoping that that becomes
the new expectation, that that
becomes the new normal. Okay. Am

352
00:47:29,792 --> 00:47:38,458
I out of time now? No? I have a
couple of minutes to go. Anybody
else? Yeah. ( Inaudible

353
00:47:38,458 --> 00:47:47,125
question ) >> We get our chips
from Nvidia. Where are the parts
built? I don't know where they

354
00:47:47,125 --> 00:47:53,250
build the chips. We assemble the
parts in China. Yes, I know, I
know. China. But we get it back

355
00:47:53,250 --> 00:48:00,583
and put our probes on it and
look at all the bits in there
and make sure that they're bits

356
00:48:00,583 --> 00:48:08,625
that we put in. We also have our
own people in the Chinese
factory supervising it. You

357
00:48:08,625 --> 00:48:21,083
know, maybe we'll build them
somewhere else someday. Yeah.
( Inaudible question ) >> Is the

358
00:48:21,083 --> 00:48:34,083
phone hardware open source? No,
it's Nvidia chip set. They're
not open source. We have to work

359
00:48:34,083 --> 00:48:43,208
with the materials that we have.
Yeah. >> So what's the thing in
privacy that you are the most

360
00:48:43,208 --> 00:48:54,583
excited about that may have
nothing to do with Black Phone?
>> Good question. I think I've

361
00:48:54,583 --> 00:49:04,792
gotten a little bit too much
tunnel vision I'm focusing on
our stuff on too much. You know,

362
00:49:04,792 --> 00:49:08,333
actually it isn't really just
one product. I think what has me
excited is now I don't have to

363
00:49:08,333 --> 00:49:17,417
twist so many arms. Everybody
now is coming home to Jesus. If
I ever meet Snowden, I have to

364
00:49:17,417 --> 00:49:33,333
thank him for waking everybody
up. ( Applause ) >> Okay. I
think that's it. Oh, one more.

365
00:49:33,333 --> 00:49:40,833
Yeah. >> I just wanted to know
what is your thoughts on the
emergence of quantum encryption?

366
00:49:40,833 --> 00:49:47,750
>> It's an interesting bit of
science that is a lot of fun. I
majored in physics before I

367
00:49:47,750 --> 00:49:56,542
switched to computer science.
It's not easy to apply it to the
general use cases, you know. You

368
00:49:56,542 --> 00:50:02,083
have to do it only for fiber
optics, and you know, I need to
be able to do practical things

369
00:50:02,083 --> 00:50:09,583
over WiFi and Ethernet and all
kinds of other things. I need to
be sitting on an airplane and

370
00:50:09,583 --> 00:50:16,375
make a secured call through the
airplane's WiFi, which goes up
to a satellite and back down to

371
00:50:16,375 --> 00:50:22,750
the ground. I mean, quantum
photography is an interesting
feature in the science

372
00:50:22,750 --> 00:50:28,333
experiment. It is a lot of fun,
but I don't see it as really
something that's going to change

373
00:50:28,333 --> 00:50:34,917
the world. >> Do you think that
once it is perfected it will
work well with your ideas, if

374
00:50:34,917 --> 00:50:43,083
ever? >> Well, you can't really
get beyond fiber optics or a
very line of sight preparations

375
00:50:43,083 --> 00:50:48,458
with it, so I don't think it
will get beyond that. It's a lot
of fun, but I don't see it as

376
00:50:48,458 --> 00:00:00,000
being ‑‑ I would rather use PKI
over those. Okay. I think we're
done. Thank you. (Applause)
