00:00:00,125 --> 00:00:06,500
>> Okay. Good afternoon,
everything. Welcome to my
presentation. During this 20

2
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:11,708
minute presentation, I will try
to prevent you  ‑ ‑ present you
some of the findings I have

3
00:00:11,708 --> 00:00:17,708
discovered doing research. I
will I will probably not get
into detail since I only have 20

4
00:00:22,583 --> 00:00:28,583
minutes. But don't hesitate to
see me after the talk. As you
will see, I have many  focuses

5
00:00:36,083 --> 00:00:42,083
on analyzing the mull mead  ‑ ‑
multimedia, and this paper has
been prepared with my colleague

6
00:00:47,417 --> 00:00:53,417
and friend. He is currently
playing a game, I will also be
playing that game. That doesn't

7
00:00:55,500 --> 00:01:02,417
matter. [ Laughter ] But last,
but not least, I'm not a  native
English speaker. If there is

8
00:01:02,417 --> 00:01:08,417
something that you do not hear,
or understand me, please do not
hesitate to interrupt me and I

9
00:01:10,667 --> 00:01:16,667
will speak better. So today I
will start by presenting myself,
explaining who I am. And I will

10
00:01:25,167 --> 00:01:31,167
try to explain why I decided to
do some research about the
firmware of the call. I will

11
00:01:33,375 --> 00:01:39,375
then present the models on which
I did my research and I will try
to explain how to find the

12
00:01:42,167 --> 00:01:48,333
firmware of the target, because
it is not always easy. How to
approach the firm  ‑ ‑ firmware

13
00:01:48,333 --> 00:01:54,333
on the card and what are my main
findings. So my name is Paul.
And my twitter name, and then I

14
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:09,250
will try to update and post my
findings this week. Feel free to
follow me. In my life I'm a 

15
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:15,250
secure engineer for a  Swiss
company called SCRT. We are in
Geneva and specializing in

16
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:30,750
digital hacking and forensics.
My main hobbies are mountain
bike, race and a fan of (

17
00:02:35,042 --> 00:02:42,667
Indiscernible ), this is the
reason why I decided to mix two
of my hobbies. I teach security

18
00:02:42,667 --> 00:02:48,167
and motto sports. I tried to do
some research for IT security
and mountain bike, but they were

19
00:02:48,167 --> 00:02:55,917
not able to find a  subject. Not
yet. Because as you have seen
the new forks now are

20
00:02:55,917 --> 00:03:01,917
electronic. So maybe someday.
Yeah. [ Laughter ] And we also
are the organizers of the Swiss

21
00:03:09,125 --> 00:03:15,125
security event. This is now the
eighth edition. March  2015 in
Geneva there is a  conference.

22
00:03:20,083 --> 00:03:26,083
You are more than welcome to
join us. As I said before, the
research was done by my friend.

23
00:03:32,375 --> 00:03:38,375
You also follow him on twitter.
So why I have decided to do some
research on hacking firmware?

24
00:03:43,583 --> 00:03:49,583
For nonprofit, of course. A lot
of research has been done
regarding DB and so on I wanted

25
00:03:53,625 --> 00:03:59,625
to find something else, as you
know, the car entertainment
system is the music that can

26
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:08,500
play the music, that can do the
navigation, that can connect to
your phone, it is also do much

27
00:04:11,375 --> 00:04:16,958
more than just entertainment.
Most of the car entertainment
system today can also control

28
00:04:16,958 --> 00:04:23,292
the lights of the car, control
the looking of the car, the
heating system, the axillary

29
00:04:23,292 --> 00:04:30,833
heating. A lot of options are
possible to control using the
car entertainment system. So it

30
00:04:30,833 --> 00:04:36,833
sounds interesting. Then today I
have discovered that a lot of
cars have built in options like 

31
00:04:40,833 --> 00:04:48,042
‑ ‑ television, like blue tooth,
like axillary heating that are
just software activated. So it

32
00:04:48,042 --> 00:04:54,042
sounds interesting. The main
model on which I did my research
is a Volkswagen, the second

33
00:04:56,583 --> 00:05:02,583
version from 2011. Well, I live
in Switzerland, I said before,
I'm living at 2,007‑ meter high,

34
00:05:06,792 --> 00:05:13,417
so I need a  car that can drive
in the snow. This is an
interesting car, because it is

35
00:05:13,417 --> 00:05:21,083
quite modern, and I'm able to do
a lot of things with that unit.
And last, but not least, this is

36
00:05:21,083 --> 00:05:27,375
an important detail, this is my
every day car. So not a car
dedicated to my research. This

37
00:05:27,375 --> 00:05:33,375
is very important to understand
why later on. The multimedia
unit of that car is called the

38
00:05:37,625 --> 00:05:43,625
RNS800PC. You can find in other
cars like Audi models the Q7,
I'm not sure. And find the same

39
00:05:46,208 --> 00:05:52,208
unit in Bentley cars, I'm sure.
You find that in several,
several brands. So the first

40
00:06:05,083 --> 00:06:12,708
talk was to get access to the
firmware of the car. So I have
to find some sources. The first

41
00:06:12,708 --> 00:06:20,208
way is the hard way and it
consists of dismounting the car,
find the disk, and do a  DV of

42
00:06:20,208 --> 00:06:24,708
the disk to get access to the
firmware. The disk is located
behind the box so it is not easy

43
00:06:24,708 --> 00:06:30,500
to find and it takes some time
to get access to the disk. So I
discovered that's after breaking

44
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:36,500
the car. So  ‑ ‑ now, we know
where to find the disk. This is
not the way I have chosen

45
00:06:43,167 --> 00:06:49,167
initially. You have a second
option. Which is to find it on
eBay. The problem is I'm not

46
00:06:55,375 --> 00:07:01,917
sure the disk would be solved
with the unit. I was not sure if
the disk of part of the car or

47
00:07:01,917 --> 00:07:07,667
was part of the unit. This is
not the option I have chosen.
You can try to do some social

48
00:07:07,667 --> 00:07:14,375
engineering on the, on the
Volkswagen dealer you are
working with. But again I have

49
00:07:14,375 --> 00:07:20,375
not chosen this option. For some
models I have discovered that
firmware of the unit is, is

50
00:07:23,292 --> 00:07:29,292
upgrade every time (
Indiscernible ). I did some
tests on an Audi TT of 2008. In

51
00:07:31,333 --> 00:07:37,333
that case it seeps that the
firmware of the unit is included
in the CD that you get to

52
00:07:40,708 --> 00:07:46,708
upgrade the GPS, the map of the
GPS. And the final option is
just to use Google. If you

53
00:07:49,625 --> 00:07:56,875
Google update firmware and the
exact model and unit, it is
quite easy to find someone to

54
00:07:56,875 --> 00:08:03,167
sell you the firmware. Probably 
‑ ‑ it is mechanical trying to
sell it. Anyway, that works. So

55
00:08:03,167 --> 00:08:09,167
that's how I did get access to
the firmware. Then you have to
find a way to upload the

56
00:08:13,333 --> 00:08:19,333
firmware on the car. Again there
is the possibility to  ‑ ‑ thank
you. [ Applause ] And that's the

57
00:08:33,708 --> 00:08:41,125
recall. It is made in
Switzerland. So you can try to 
‑ ‑ [ Applause ] Okay. So again

58
00:08:41,125 --> 00:08:47,125
you can try to improve the
firmware by dismounting the
disk, getting access to the disk

59
00:08:56,875 --> 00:09:02,875
and pushing the firmware on the
disk. And another solution that
is easier includes finding the

60
00:09:07,792 --> 00:09:15,167
magic. Most of the car you can
find a  special combination of
key. And you hold the key for 3

61
00:09:15,167 --> 00:09:21,167
to 5  seconds and get access to
menu that will allow you to
upload the firmware on the car.

62
00:09:33,208 --> 00:09:39,208
[ Laughter ] [ Applause ] >> All
right. Come on. >> Okay. >> He's
not from this country. We're

63
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:50,125
healthy. [ Laughter ] Cheers. [
Applause ] >> Thank you. >> How
is he doing, everybody? Is he

64
00:09:57,833 --> 00:10:03,833
doing good? >> So in my case,
you have to press prone and set
it three to five seconds to get

65
00:10:09,167 --> 00:10:17,167
access to the special menu. And
I every day. So one year I tried
to find the right combination to

66
00:10:17,167 --> 00:10:23,167
get access to the menu. By the
way, if you want to reboot the
unit you need your five fingers

67
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:31,917
because you have to press phone,
climate, navigation and traffic
button at the same time. It is

68
00:10:31,917 --> 00:10:37,917
very difficult when you are
driving. Once you manage to get
access to the menu. As you can

69
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:48,583
see on the screen, my car is in
French, so it speaks French like
me. You have access to a menu

70
00:10:48,583 --> 00:10:54,750
you when you can upload the
firmware and see the running
binaries on the car. I don't

71
00:10:54,750 --> 00:11:00,750
know if you can see that. But
you see a lot of vulnerabilities
there and a  check for each one.

72
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:09,250
These are the binaries which are
running on the car. You can see
here that there are some

73
00:11:11,917 --> 00:11:18,583
binaries, some programs that I
should not have on my car. I can
see WLAN. I can see T.V., or

74
00:11:18,583 --> 00:11:24,583
things like that, I do not have
those options on my car. Then if
you navigate through the menu

75
00:11:27,417 --> 00:11:33,458
and get access to the new menu,
which is called upgrade, you can
choose if you want to upgrade

76
00:11:33,458 --> 00:11:39,458
the firmware from the CD, the
DVD or the USB plug. There is
also another option to approach

77
00:11:43,542 --> 00:11:49,000
the firmware and modify the
firmware which consists of using
the software providing by vokes

78
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:55,000
weigh  ‑ ‑ Volkswagen and the
connector that I do not have.
Okay. Once you have the

79
00:11:59,292 --> 00:12:06,375
firmware. The interesting part.
You can try to analyze the
firmware. In my case, it is a 

80
00:12:06,375 --> 00:12:12,375
mix of EOS and IOS. So we used
a  system by it to modify the
PSS tool to create to new system

81
00:12:27,375 --> 00:12:33,375
which was readable. The script
is provided in my, in my  ‑ ‑ in
my slides so that you can

82
00:12:35,667 --> 00:12:42,000
reproduce file. And we deletes
files to use for the IOS part.
And slightly modify it

83
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:48,000
correctly. What you can see is
that it firmware of the car is
used on QNS. So RNS850 is bigger

84
00:12:53,833 --> 00:12:59,833
than QNS. And we can see it and
super H architecture. It sounds
very interesting. So it is

85
00:13:07,833 --> 00:13:13,833
clearly a  UNIX‑ type system.
This is the same thing that we
used to extract the file from

86
00:13:16,917 --> 00:13:24,708
the system. So the UNIX‑ type
system. We can see it here with
the files, everything that you

87
00:13:24,708 --> 00:13:30,708
can find on the UNIX 5 system.
What is more surprising that it
is leaking a lot of interesting

88
00:13:34,417 --> 00:13:41,875
information that I was not
expecting to find on my car. For
example, you can see that some

89
00:13:41,875 --> 00:13:46,875
users are hardcoded in the car.
You can see the name of the guy,
and there is a  shell on the

90
00:13:46,875 --> 00:13:52,875
car. So I decided to do some
more research and it is cool,
because you can find the guy who

91
00:13:55,292 --> 00:14:01,292
linked these. So it seems that
those guys are working for the
manufacturer of the car or some

92
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:17,125
company that has been
subcontracted to, to write the 
‑ ‑ [ Laughter ] Maybe not

93
00:14:17,125 --> 00:14:23,667
anymore. Right? To, to right the
firmware. But  ‑ ‑ that's  ‑ ‑
there are some other things that

94
00:14:23,667 --> 00:14:29,750
are interesting. I think that
leaking internal IP range is
good practice, isn't it? As you

95
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:35,750
can see again in the firmware of
the car, you can see the
internal IP‑ range of Audi and

96
00:14:39,125 --> 00:14:45,125
Volkswagen and yes. The car can
do some Wi‑ Fi and SSID
configured inside of the

97
00:14:47,667 --> 00:14:53,667
firmware. So yeah. It looks like
the person who developed this
firmware are not very keen on IT

98
00:14:57,542 --> 00:15:03,542
security. So I did some research
and I tried to modify some files
on the car and at first it

99
00:15:09,833 --> 00:15:16,500
worked. So I was able to push
some new files on the car and
one day I tried to modify

100
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:22,500
another file, which was the
preconfigured and and long story
short I suddenly managed to

101
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:32,458
breach my car. Yeah. A very
heavy breach. I don't know
exactly why. Because  ‑ ‑ I have

102
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:42,917
not been able to understand how
the chips are calculating. It
really happened, as I said

103
00:15:42,917 --> 00:15:47,917
before, when I was trying to
replace a  very dummy text file.
So somebody something wrong

104
00:15:47,917 --> 00:15:53,917
happened just at that time. I
don't know. It took three months
to fix the car. It was really

105
00:15:56,958 --> 00:16:03,833
long. Because during that time,
the car was not working as
expected and at first I  bring

106
00:16:03,833 --> 00:16:11,125
the car to a  mechanic, they
said sorry we do not understand
what is happening. I had to send

107
00:16:11,125 --> 00:16:18,750
it to a  second CRH. They were
not understanding either. So I
told them, okay. A  friend of

108
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:24,750
mine told me  ‑ ‑ [ Laughter ]
That the  ‑ ‑ a  friend of mine
told me it could be the hard

109
00:16:29,542 --> 00:16:35,542
drive of the car that needs to
be replaced. And they answered,
sorry. Sir, but there is no hard

110
00:16:38,042 --> 00:16:45,208
drive in that car? [ Laughter ]
Okay. So finally it took three
months and they gave me back the

111
00:16:45,208 --> 00:16:51,208
car and said we had to replace
the black box of the car. So
yeah. Exclusions. It is a  very

112
00:16:55,042 --> 00:17:01,042
expensive hobby. And my friend
and his family does not want me
to do tests with their car

113
00:17:04,583 --> 00:17:11,792
anymore. It is a shame, because
my car, my wife, has a  very
interesting car, but  ‑ ‑ she do

114
00:17:11,792 --> 00:17:17,792
not want me to approach the car
with laptop anymore. [ Laughter
] So initially, my goal was to

115
00:17:19,917 --> 00:17:25,208
do some research on the
multimedia libraries of the car.
I have been abled identify

116
00:17:25,208 --> 00:17:32,250
libraries that are used the MP3
videos and things like that. It
could be very, very interesting

117
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:38,250
to look more in‑ depth to those
libraries to run a  shell on the
car. So I hope it was

118
00:17:42,042 --> 00:17:48,042
interesting. If you have
questions, you  ‑ ‑ are free to
speak to us. Thanks a lot. When

119
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:19,125
the car was break, it was simple
to drive. It had no GPS, it was
not simple to use loading. It

120
00:18:19,125 --> 00:18:25,125
was not possible to turn on the
light and turn off the light
when I was arriving home. It was

121
00:18:25,125 --> 00:18:31,625
not possible to control the
heating of the car. Yeah. It
was  ‑ ‑ sorry? The windows

122
00:18:31,625 --> 00:18:37,625
still work  ‑ ‑ windows still
worked. Yes. [ Laughter ] Yeah.
That's what I should have done.

123
00:18:42,792 --> 00:18:48,792
Find the hard drive first.
