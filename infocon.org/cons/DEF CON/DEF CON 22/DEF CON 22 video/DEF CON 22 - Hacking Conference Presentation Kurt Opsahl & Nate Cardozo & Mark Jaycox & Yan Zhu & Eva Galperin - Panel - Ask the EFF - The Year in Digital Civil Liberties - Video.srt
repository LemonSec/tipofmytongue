1
00:00:00,042 --> 00:00:04,792
I'd like to introduce the EFF
panel. This is the ask the EFF
panel. You get to ask some of

2
00:00:04,792 --> 00:00:08,542
the premier legal minds devoted
to making your sure your ass
doesn't end up in jail,

3
00:00:08,542 --> 00:00:14,375
questions. So I'm going to hand
it off to Kurt Opsahl. And let
him introduce his panelists.

4
00:00:14,375 --> 00:00:20,417
>> Welcome everybody. So great
to see so many people here
today. How many of you are

5
00:00:20,417 --> 00:00:25,750
already familiar. With EFF? All
right. I have a good number of
hands. Thank you for following

6
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:32,792
our issues. So I'll make only
the briefest descriptions for
those who haven't. Electronic

7
00:00:32,792 --> 00:00:37,667
Frontier Foundation. We are a
nonprofit civil liberties
organization, dedicated to

8
00:00:37,667 --> 00:00:43,750
defending your rights online.
For fair use, for privacy, for
innovation. And we want to make

9
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:49,167
sure the future is one we want
to live in. One of the things
that we do a lot here is we

10
00:00:49,167 --> 00:00:55,792
provide free legal advice to
speakers and security
researchers, who need that. And

11
00:00:55,792 --> 00:01:02,250
we're here today to answer your
questions. We'll start out by
giving brief introductions to my

12
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:07,750
co-panelists here. So you can
see what sort of work we do.
Give you some ideas about

13
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:15,500
questions to ask. One ground
rule very important as we do
provide legal advice, and we

14
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:21,292
often have had members of this
community become our clients,
but this is not the place to ask

15
00:01:21,292 --> 00:01:25,833
legal advice. You want to have a
attorney client privilege
conversation which is

16
00:01:25,833 --> 00:01:30,833
confidential. When you're
explaining the things that you
might have done and you're

17
00:01:30,833 --> 00:01:35,667
worried about. When you're doing
it in front of several hundred
people, that is not the right

18
00:01:35,667 --> 00:01:39,542
place for it. So if you have
those sorts of questions, save
them for later. Come find us

19
00:01:39,542 --> 00:01:45,542
after. Write to info@EFF.org.
Our intake coordinator can help
you get in touch with the right

20
00:01:48,292 --> 00:01:54,958
people. But, umm, for these
questions, any other topics
about what we do? We'd love to

21
00:01:54,958 --> 00:01:59,792
hear them. So let's start out
and have our panel introduce
themselves. >> Hi there. My name

22
00:01:59,792 --> 00:02:04,875
is Eva Galperin. I'm a global
policy analyst with the
Electronic Frontier Foundation.

23
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:12,167
I work on EFF's international
team. Meaning that while we have
many employees of EFF who's job

24
00:02:12,167 --> 00:02:19,333
it is to worry about U.S. law
and U.S. surveillance and sort
of U.S. persons, my team worries

25
00:02:19,333 --> 00:02:26,833
about the rest of the world.
We're a little busy and we don't
sleep much. Primarily, I work on

26
00:02:26,833 --> 00:02:33,167
-- my work is focused on
vulnerable populations. Which
means usually journalists and

27
00:02:33,167 --> 00:02:39,167
dissidents and activists. I work
on privacy surveillance security
and free speech issues. You can

28
00:02:42,542 --> 00:02:47,417
ask me about sort of the
security and privacy advice that
EFF is giving, the kind of

29
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:54,292
training that we're doing with
people in Ethiopia and Vietnam.
I'm also particularly interested

30
00:02:54,292 --> 00:03:01,208
in the post Soviet states.
There's a lot of really
interesting stuff going on with

31
00:03:01,208 --> 00:03:07,958
surveillance right now in the
U.K. and Australia. I am also
available to answer various

32
00:03:07,958 --> 00:03:13,208
questions about sort of how EFF
views security research because
I have published a great deal of

33
00:03:13,208 --> 00:03:20,333
security research with EFF and
also in cooperation with citizen
lab. So having said that, here's

34
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:28,000
Yan. >> Hay, I'm YAN, I'm a
staff technologist at EFF which
is a really vague title. But I

35
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,792
maintain a browser extension
called HTTPS everywhere with the
tore project. Wow, thank you.

36
00:03:33,792 --> 00:03:41,125
[Applause] Cool. Yeah. Making a
new release when I get back on
Monday, I also make a browser

37
00:03:41,125 --> 00:03:46,708
extension called privacy badger.
That's an ad -- You guys really
like browser extensions. Ok I'm

38
00:03:46,708 --> 00:03:52,125
not done yet. We'll get this.
And what else do I do? We have a
new mail encryption project

39
00:03:52,125 --> 00:03:57,042
called star TLS everywhere which
I've spoken about here for a
little bit. In general my work

40
00:03:57,042 --> 00:04:03,542
is on -- focus on how do we
protect people's privacy from
advertisers and governments and

41
00:04:03,542 --> 00:04:08,458
so forth. And also how do we get
people who run servers to turn
on encryption as much as they

42
00:04:08,458 --> 00:04:16,083
can. So you can ask me anything.
>> Hey guys, I'm Mark Jaycox.
I'm a legislative analyst with

43
00:04:16,083 --> 00:04:21,458
EFF where I hope to get our
message to congress and talk to
lawmakers and work -- depending

44
00:04:21,458 --> 00:04:25,292
on the congressmen or
congresswoman, argue what their
staffers about what they're

45
00:04:25,292 --> 00:04:30,250
doing. What they're trying to
do. And how their legislation
will impact tech. My main

46
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:36,125
issues, issues I work on deal a
lot with national security
issues, surveillance law, the

47
00:04:36,125 --> 00:04:41,917
CFAA the Computer Fraud and
Abuse Act. And kind of a lot of
the surveillance privacy laws.

48
00:04:41,917 --> 00:04:48,250
>> I'm Nate Cardozo, I'm a staff
attorney with the Electronic
Frontier Foundation. I'm on the

49
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:54,333
civil liberties team. I do free
speech and privacy and I work
with Curt on the coders writes

50
00:04:54,333 --> 00:04:58,083
project. We represent hackers
and security researchers and
academics to try to keep them

51
00:04:58,083 --> 00:05:04,083
out of trouble and get them out
of trouble. We do in fact
counsel people who present at

52
00:05:06,208 --> 00:05:11,375
conferences just like this to
make sure they don't say
anything that they will regret

53
00:05:11,375 --> 00:05:18,042
in front of a room full of Feds.
I work on, I don't really work
on the national security cases

54
00:05:18,042 --> 00:05:22,542
that we do. Right now I'm suing
the government of Ethiopia for
wiretapping an American citizen

55
00:05:22,542 --> 00:05:28,458
on American soil using a
targeted malware program called
FinFisher. If the FinFisher guys

56
00:05:28,458 --> 00:05:34,458
are here, tell them I say hi. I
work on some automotive privacy
issues because I like cars. I do

57
00:05:38,125 --> 00:05:42,333
freedom of information act
litigation as well and right now
along with our legal fellow

58
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:48,833
Andrew Crocker, who is not here,
I am suing the NSA and the
office of the director of

59
00:05:48,833 --> 00:05:53,042
national intelligence to get
them to court over documents
about the so called

60
00:05:53,042 --> 00:05:59,375
vulnerabilities equities
process. This is the balancing
test the government uses to

61
00:05:59,375 --> 00:06:04,958
decide whether or not to sit on
zero days. And we want to know
what that process is because

62
00:06:04,958 --> 00:06:09,875
they haven't told anybody. And
so we foyed it and of course
they didn't respond so we sued.

63
00:06:09,875 --> 00:06:15,875
That's what I do. [Applause]
>> As I said, I'm Kurt Opsahl
another one of the attorneys at

64
00:06:21,708 --> 00:06:26,583
EFF. Let me tell you about a
couple other pieces of
litigation that we work on that

65
00:06:26,583 --> 00:06:31,500
you guys might have questions
about. We have a couple of
active suits against the

66
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:37,167
National Security Agency for the
war against wiretapping program
trying to put a halt to the

67
00:06:37,167 --> 00:06:45,000
unconstitutional legal telephone
records program and the upstream
wiretapping program. I also am

68
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:50,792
working on the case against
national security letters. These
are letters that the FBI can

69
00:06:50,792 --> 00:06:56,542
issue to serve providers without
a court, without any process. To
obtain information about their

70
00:06:56,542 --> 00:07:01,875
customers and if they get one,
the service providers aren't
allowed to tell anybody, even

71
00:07:01,875 --> 00:07:07,458
the fact that they have received
one, we got a court to declare
it was unconstitutional last

72
00:07:07,458 --> 00:07:13,458
year. Thank you. [Applause] The
government has appealed. We are
defending that appeal so

73
00:07:17,042 --> 00:07:22,000
argument will be in early
October and we will go explain
to the appeals court, why that's

74
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,708
not right and shouldn't be
allowed. We also work on some
intellectual property issues.

75
00:07:27,708 --> 00:07:35,625
Probably answer some of your
copyright questions if they come
up. And I guess with that, let's

76
00:07:35,625 --> 00:07:41,375
start this up with the
questions. Sir. >> Thank you.
Can you hear me okay? >> Yes >>

77
00:07:41,375 --> 00:07:47,375
My name is Don Nindell. I'm CEO
of a Nevada corporation. I have
two patents on security. They

78
00:07:49,625 --> 00:07:55,625
deal with encryption. Because of
that, about three years ago, I
got a card from one of the ACLU

79
00:07:57,708 --> 00:08:03,708
panelists. And I want to ask, do
you compliment? Do you work with
ACLU? What I'm thinking about

80
00:08:07,083 --> 00:08:14,125
is, maybe I need a card from one
of you also because if I'm in
encryption, you know exactly

81
00:08:14,125 --> 00:08:20,125
who's looking at it and why I'm
a person of interest. Is it
possible to be able to edit --

82
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:26,500
to get a card like this after --
in a private session? Because I
think some day they're going to

83
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:33,375
be right here standing besides
me and yanking me off. Do you
understand my question? >> I

84
00:08:33,375 --> 00:08:37,667
think the question is -- how do
we work together with our
friends at the ACLU. >> Yeah,

85
00:08:37,667 --> 00:08:44,042
you complement each other? Do
you coordinate? Do you work side
by side. And which one of you

86
00:08:44,042 --> 00:08:50,333
would be the best one for me to
consult with in the event that
no such agency -- I'm not

87
00:08:50,333 --> 00:08:55,500
supposed to mention it. >> The
second part of the question was
how do you get assistance from

88
00:08:55,500 --> 00:09:01,875
EFF when you find yourself in
legal hot water. >> Something
like that yeah. >> Let me

89
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:07,917
address, I guess, the first
question, the first and we work
together very closely with the

90
00:09:07,917 --> 00:09:13,208
ACLU. For example, one case that
we're working on about the 215
records program. We are

91
00:09:13,208 --> 00:09:19,625
co-counseling with the ACLU. So
that's a pretty tight
relationship. We have been

92
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:25,833
Amicus which is -- in court
cases, in addition to the
parties, you can come in as an

93
00:09:25,833 --> 00:09:31,125
Amicus like a friend of the
court to provide some additional
views to the court from your

94
00:09:31,125 --> 00:09:37,167
community. So we've often done
this in ACLU cases. They've
often done that in our cases. So

95
00:09:37,167 --> 00:09:41,917
I think we have actually a very
good relationship with them. And
do complement each other. And I

96
00:09:41,917 --> 00:09:49,042
think the second part of the
question was how to, how to get
assistance from EFF. So actually

97
00:09:49,042 --> 00:09:53,708
on this panel, we have two
former intake coordinators. They
have now gone onto other jobs

98
00:09:53,708 --> 00:09:58,792
with EFF. One of you guys want
to talk about that process a
little bit? >> I can do it. So

99
00:09:58,792 --> 00:10:04,583
if you would like EFF to help
you in some way, if you are
looking for legal assistance,

100
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:11,417
the thing to do is to e-mail
info@EFF.org. At the other end
of that e-mail address, is a

101
00:10:11,417 --> 00:10:18,875
very nice man named Amule whose
job it is to patiently talk to
everybody who wants EFF's help.

102
00:10:18,875 --> 00:10:23,250
Figure out whether or not this
is the sort of case that that
EFF would like to take on. And

103
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:28,833
if that's the case, put them in
touch with an EFF attorney. If
it is not an EFF case, his job

104
00:10:28,833 --> 00:10:34,458
does not end there. The next
step is to put this person
either in touch with other

105
00:10:34,458 --> 00:10:40,708
resources, especially if this is
sort of not an EFF like issue.
Or to put them in touch with our

106
00:10:40,708 --> 00:10:45,375
list of cooperating attorneys we
maintain a list of several
hundred attorneys across the

107
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:50,250
country all of whom are
interested in doing pro bono
cases and sometimes you know,

108
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:56,250
sort of semipro bono discount
cases that come EFF's way. And
who can also provide you with

109
00:10:58,625 --> 00:11:04,125
legal assistance. What we do is
send an e-mail out to that list.
And if somebody responds, we go

110
00:11:04,125 --> 00:11:10,958
ahead and put you in touch with
them. >> So YAN, I was wondering
if you could describe HTTP

111
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:17,042
Nowhere for the folks in the
room and where the implications
of billing that entails and

112
00:11:17,042 --> 00:11:22,292
stuff like that. And another
question is, could you guys talk
about the Riley case and

113
00:11:22,292 --> 00:11:26,750
implications for hackers in the
room and how things might have
changes. >> The implications

114
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:33,792
from which case? >> Riley.
>> Hacking -- Cell phone
searches. >> Absolutely yeah.

115
00:11:33,792 --> 00:11:38,417
>> Okay. I guess since you asked
the first part of the question
to me, I should answer it. How

116
00:11:38,417 --> 00:11:44,625
many people here use HTTPS
everywhere? So real quickly what
it is, it's a browser extension

117
00:11:44,625 --> 00:11:50,542
that will automatically make the
HTTPS connection to a website
when you visit it if we know

118
00:11:50,542 --> 00:11:56,833
that that server supports HTTPS
and things are unlikely to break
if we switch you over to SSL. So

119
00:11:56,833 --> 00:12:03,042
this prevents SSL strip attacks
which Moxi has presented on in
the past, and also, sometimes

120
00:12:03,042 --> 00:12:09,083
Redit for instance, doesn't
really, until recently, you had
to go to pay.redit.com to get

121
00:12:09,083 --> 00:12:15,333
the SSL version. So we would
have that automatically in a
browser extension so -- it's

122
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:21,042
pretty good. We have like 10,000
sites or so in the development
version right now. Maybe 4,000

123
00:12:21,042 --> 00:12:27,917
stable. So lately a lot of
people have been saying with all
these NSA attacks and privacy

124
00:12:27,917 --> 00:12:33,958
concerns, HTTPS Everywhere is
not good enough. What you want
is a harden Browser mode where

125
00:12:33,958 --> 00:12:39,042
you don't have any clear text
traffic. So what if you could
just only use HTTP -- sorry,

126
00:12:39,042 --> 00:12:43,292
only use HTTPS, never go to
HTTP. So it's actually pretty
easy to do from HTTPS

127
00:12:43,292 --> 00:12:49,292
Everywhere. So now if you use
the development version of HTTPS
Everywhere, you could experiment

128
00:12:54,375 --> 00:13:01,125
with this mode called HTTP
Nowhere mode where it blocks all
HTTP traffic. I have to do some

129
00:13:01,125 --> 00:13:06,958
weird things like turns off OCSP
for a little bit, otherwise,
you'll get SSL errors all the

130
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:14,458
time. I love feedback on that
and stuff like that. >> All
right. And a second part of the

131
00:13:14,458 --> 00:13:19,917
question was asking about the
Riley case, which is a recent
decision by the United States

132
00:13:19,917 --> 00:13:26,792
Supreme Court dealing with the
search of a smart phone. And of
course found nine-zero that you

133
00:13:26,792 --> 00:13:31,667
needed to have a warrant to get
this information. This is a
really good decision. Not only

134
00:13:31,667 --> 00:13:34,917
is it a good decision because
this means that the government
needs to get a warrant on a cell

135
00:13:34,917 --> 00:13:40,250
phone if you're arrested. That's
good enough in itself, but it
helps establish precedent for

136
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:46,750
other cases. The discussion in
that case has a lot of really
good language that is going to

137
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:54,167
end up in briefs. For years to
come where the court was saying
your whole life is in your

138
00:13:54,167 --> 00:14:00,833
phone. It matters to protect
this information and that they
-- the governments argument that

139
00:14:00,833 --> 00:14:07,083
well, you know, basically as
technology made things easier to
have on your person. We should

140
00:14:07,083 --> 00:14:12,042
sort of treat this like -- just
whatever happened to be in your
pockets -- ordinarily they can

141
00:14:12,042 --> 00:14:18,167
look in your pockets and search
to arrest. So they wanted to
have the effect of new

142
00:14:18,167 --> 00:14:23,875
technology be an expansion of
police power to search. So they
would be able to get anything

143
00:14:23,875 --> 00:14:27,958
that happened to be in your
pocket, all the way into the
phone and potentially into any

144
00:14:27,958 --> 00:14:33,542
server side information that was
accessible to the phone. And the
supreme court rejected that

145
00:14:33,542 --> 00:14:40,292
theory. Rejected their theory
that because these phones were
connected to servers elsewhere,

146
00:14:40,292 --> 00:14:45,375
that the, you had given up your
privacy rights to them because
you had communicated that

147
00:14:45,375 --> 00:14:48,625
information to a third party.
The government said therefore
you didn't care about this

148
00:14:48,625 --> 00:14:52,958
information -- should be free
rain. No warrant needed. The
court rejected that. The

149
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:59,792
government said, well we put
forth some regulations and rules
that will make sure this happens

150
00:14:59,792 --> 00:15:05,417
in a very orderly and nice
manner And the courts said our
founders didn't fight a

151
00:15:05,417 --> 00:15:11,417
revolution to have government
regulations and rules. This is
9-0. Right? [Applause] So if you

152
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:23,792
guys read in our briefs and the
years to come, I think you're
going to see a lot of quotes

153
00:15:23,792 --> 00:15:29,125
from the Riley decision and
we're going to try to make that
precedent stick all over on

154
00:15:29,125 --> 00:15:35,125
fourth amendment issues.
[Applause] >> Hi, I'm Andrew
Conway. I'm a researcher for

155
00:15:39,167 --> 00:15:45,125
Cloud Mark. I'd actually be
interested in a a comment from
each member of the panel on this

156
00:15:45,125 --> 00:15:51,667
one. What do you think the best
and worst things that have
happened in the past year from

157
00:15:51,667 --> 00:15:55,625
the point of view of your
particular work for the year
ahead? >> Awesome question. >>

158
00:15:55,625 --> 00:15:59,375
Great question. >> All right
well, we're hitting the whole
panel. Let's keep it very brief.

159
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:06,000
I think I'll start out with some
of the best and the worst
things. It's the same thing

160
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:11,542
which is the revelations that we
have learned about -- the
additional information we have

161
00:16:11,542 --> 00:16:16,083
learned about NSA surveillance.
The best thing because we now
have much more information about

162
00:16:16,083 --> 00:16:22,333
it, it helps us fight our law
suits against the NSA and it
helps make people aware of

163
00:16:22,333 --> 00:16:27,667
what's going on and the need to
stop it. It's the worst thing
because oh my God, they're doing

164
00:16:27,667 --> 00:16:31,583
an amazing amount of
surveillance on us in
contravention of our

165
00:16:31,583 --> 00:16:36,542
constitutional rights. >> I'm
going to take a very similar
approach which is the, I'm going

166
00:16:36,542 --> 00:16:42,292
to talk about a different leak
which happened just last week
and earlier this week. There was

167
00:16:42,292 --> 00:16:48,292
a hacker who goes by the name of
Finius Fisher who broke into
Gamma. >> Huh? >> So the hacker

168
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:59,000
who broke into Gamma, which is a
company which makes a product
called Vinture and Vinspy. They

169
00:17:07,125 --> 00:17:13,125
went ahead and pulled a bunch of
their brochures and also a whole
lot of other documentation. And

170
00:17:17,042 --> 00:17:22,917
some of their source code. And
put it all online. One of the
most interesting revelations

171
00:17:22,917 --> 00:17:29,708
that have come about as a result
of this particular hack is
conformation of a lot of the

172
00:17:29,708 --> 00:17:34,292
work that Citizen Lab has been
doing over the last couple of
years about the fact that this

173
00:17:34,292 --> 00:17:41,333
company which is based in the UK
and Germany is selling its
surveillance equipment to

174
00:17:41,333 --> 00:17:48,000
governments that are using it
for very shady purposes. Using
it to spy on activists and

175
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:54,417
journalists and possibly
committing human rights abuses.
So it's really great to get sort

176
00:17:54,417 --> 00:18:01,083
of conformation about this stuff
that we have been suspecting for
several years. Umm, the bad

177
00:18:01,083 --> 00:18:07,250
news, I think the worst thing
that I've really seen this year
is a lot of security and privacy

178
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:13,250
burn out. I talk to journalists
and activists all over the world
and I watch them sub come to the

179
00:18:17,042 --> 00:18:23,875
privacy anihilism. They read
things like the FinFisher hack
or they look at the NSA

180
00:18:23,875 --> 00:18:30,500
documents and they say well the
government knows how to get to
everything all the time anyway.

181
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:35,375
So why should I bother
protecting my privacy and
security at all. And this is

182
00:18:35,375 --> 00:18:41,500
really one of those -- one of
the most important fights that
we need to fight on the world

183
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:48,500
stage, which is getting people
the technical information they
need to understand that when you

184
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:53,750
simply give up on protecting
your privacy and security, you
are letting the bad guys win.

185
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:57,958
Governments want you to think
that they are all powerful and
that they see everything all the

186
00:18:57,958 --> 00:19:02,500
time. Because if you don't do
anything, you make that work
trivial. And there are a couple

187
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:08,500
things that you can do that will
make their job hard. [Applause]
>> That is a difficult answer to

188
00:19:14,875 --> 00:19:19,875
follow up. So I'm just going to
say something really boring
which is that SSL usage is

189
00:19:19,875 --> 00:19:24,958
actually up quite significantly.
So there's a report that stated
in some parts of the world, like

190
00:19:24,958 --> 00:19:31,167
Latin America, peak traffic
percentage of that that's
encrypted has gone from about

191
00:19:31,167 --> 00:19:37,542
one or two percent to about ten
percent. It's amazing. And it's
largely because major service

192
00:19:37,542 --> 00:19:42,833
providers have been turning on
SSL. And there's more about to
come. So Cloud Core has said if

193
00:19:42,833 --> 00:19:49,083
we SSL for all customers -- but
very soon -- and word process
said, we're turning on SSL for

194
00:19:49,083 --> 00:19:55,958
everyone in the next year.
That's a lot of sites. So we're
doing okay on that front. The

195
00:19:55,958 --> 00:20:01,375
bad things that happened this
year was Heart Bleed. And it was
really demoralizing to other

196
00:20:01,375 --> 00:20:07,375
people and we -- as a maintainer
of HTTPS Everywhere I actually
noticed some sites starting to

197
00:20:07,375 --> 00:20:12,208
break after Heart Bleed because
their operators said we're just
not going to use SSL now. We're

198
00:20:12,208 --> 00:20:17,625
going to turn it off. And that's
really sad. >> So you know what?
It is very rough out there but

199
00:20:17,625 --> 00:20:23,542
you know what's a little comfort
to everybody? A little bit of
tradition. But what we could all

200
00:20:23,542 --> 00:20:29,625
use right now is something that
we all know and love. Which is
welcoming new speakers. I know

201
00:20:29,625 --> 00:20:35,625
not everybody that's up here is
new. Some of you have spoken
before. Please raise your hand

202
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:44,000
if you are a new speaker at Def
Con. >> Alright! [Applause] >>
I'll also take a drink cheers.

203
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:56,125
Congratulations. [Applause] >>
That's good too. >> I'm awake
now. >> Now back to your

204
00:20:59,667 --> 00:21:05,667
regularly scheduled mayhem.
Thanks guys. >> Thanks guys. I
will have to take a similar

205
00:21:08,292 --> 00:21:12,958
approach to Curt I think the
worse things are -- is really
the information we've had from

206
00:21:12,958 --> 00:21:18,125
Snowden, from the leakers. I
think the best thing though I
will take is part of the

207
00:21:18,125 --> 00:21:24,542
educational aspects. The public,
larger public non-tech people
are becoming a lot more aware of

208
00:21:24,542 --> 00:21:28,667
what they share -- who they
share with. Their behavior's
changing. They're learning what

209
00:21:28,667 --> 00:21:33,833
a third party is. And where
their information is potentially
going. To data brokers and other

210
00:21:33,833 --> 00:21:38,167
third parties. And at least in
-- particularly in my area,
especially working on the

211
00:21:38,167 --> 00:21:43,000
legislative side and with
congress, members of congress
actually are getting educated on

212
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:48,458
these things. We've seen members
of congress outraged that they
were not properly briefed on

213
00:21:48,458 --> 00:21:52,958
this stuff. And completely
outraged that they have a right
to know, they should have been

214
00:21:52,958 --> 00:21:59,500
informed and they weren't in
some instances. So that has a
huge impact on where congress is

215
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:05,917
moving with this stuff, gaining
a base understanding of the
complexity of these systems.

216
00:22:05,917 --> 00:22:11,250
Complexity of what the NSA and
government and intelligence
agencies are collecting. So

217
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:17,292
those are really the two most
important aspects on my book.
You have a clear response which

218
00:22:17,292 --> 00:22:22,208
was, increase education from the
public and from members of
congress. And that provides a

219
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:26,375
base level, right, it provides a
foundation to understanding the
systems and it provides the

220
00:22:26,375 --> 00:22:32,000
foundation to reorienting your
actions towards more privacy
friendly, towards a more tech

221
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:37,000
friendly environment and in
particular when it comes to
lawmakers, legislation, and

222
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:43,583
smart legislation. And actually
thoughtful legislation. >> So,
one of the projects that I work

223
00:22:43,583 --> 00:22:48,667
on at EFF is our, who has your
back report. This is the report
where we give gold stars to

224
00:22:48,667 --> 00:22:53,375
companies that have good
practices in protecting user
data. Companies are little

225
00:22:53,375 --> 00:22:58,833
children and they respond very
well to being offered gold
stars. This year was our fourth

226
00:22:58,833 --> 00:23:05,167
year, fourth? Fourth year of who
has your back. And the best
thing that we saw this year, far

227
00:23:05,167 --> 00:23:11,000
and away, is companies almost
down the line with the big
Internet Service Providers.

228
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Google, Microsoft, Facebook,
Apple, are promising to give
notice to users when the

229
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:24,833
government comes seeking their
data unless they're gagged. That
is just extraordinarily

230
00:23:24,833 --> 00:23:30,750
important if a company gives
notice to the user when the
government comes seeking their

231
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:36,375
data, that means the user can
fight back they can contact
info@EFF.org. We can move to

232
00:23:36,375 --> 00:23:41,792
quash the process. And if the
company doesn't give notice, no
one can fight because the

233
00:23:41,792 --> 00:23:46,458
company's not going to do it.
We've seen in the last year that
column on our who has your back

234
00:23:46,458 --> 00:23:54,000
report just filled with stars
and it's awesome. That frankly
is a direct result of the

235
00:23:54,000 --> 00:24:00,667
Snowden leaks. The companies had
egg on their face with that
beautiful prison slide that we

236
00:24:00,667 --> 00:24:07,375
saw on August 6th of last year.
So they needed to do something
-- or June 6th -- they needed to

237
00:24:07,375 --> 00:24:10,833
do something. And they are. And
that's great. I think the worst
thing that I've seen this year

238
00:24:10,833 --> 00:24:16,833
is CFAA reform is stalled in
congress. It's not moving and it
needs to move. After our friend

239
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:26,250
Aaron Schwartz's tragic death,
there was some momentum behind
it, and now it's not moving. And

240
00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:32,250
that sucks and it needs to
change. >> Alright. So when I
receive an email with a GPG

241
00:24:35,417 --> 00:24:39,542
signature, it's really
reassuring that I know that the
e-mail comes from the person I

242
00:24:39,542 --> 00:24:46,750
want it from. Is a GPG signature
generally considered evidence in
court that an email came from a

243
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:51,792
place, and ultimately a lack of
a GPG signature can that be used
as evidence that an e-mail

244
00:24:51,792 --> 00:24:56,792
didn't come from someone --
asking for a friend. >> As to
the second part of the question,

245
00:24:56,792 --> 00:25:02,375
I don't think anyone's ever
tried that. As to the first part
of the question, you would need

246
00:25:02,375 --> 00:25:07,792
an expert testimony to support
that. Umm, but sure. I mean it
helps establish train of

247
00:25:07,792 --> 00:25:13,792
custody. It helps establish
authentication. It's not forged.
My GPG fingerprint is on my

248
00:25:13,792 --> 00:25:20,375
business card and I encourage
all of you to do the same thing.
So I know it's actually your GPG

249
00:25:20,375 --> 00:25:26,375
signature. Anyway, yeah. >> Can
I ask a quick follow up which is
weird because I'm on the panel.

250
00:25:26,375 --> 00:25:32,375
But that was a great question.
Conversely. >> Get in line.
>> What's that? >> Get in line.

251
00:25:38,292 --> 00:25:44,250
[Laughing] >> So conversely,
people say OPR's great. Because
that's plausible deniability. Do

252
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:50,167
you think that will hold up in
court as evidence that someone
didn't say something if the

253
00:25:50,167 --> 00:25:56,167
other party turns over their
chat logs. >> Maybe. >> I don't
know. Okay. >> I'm a lawyer. The

254
00:25:58,375 --> 00:26:05,167
answer is it depends. >> Well
it's complicated. [Laughing]
>> Well plausible deniability

255
00:26:05,167 --> 00:26:13,083
and non-repudiation are two
different things. So, sorry, did
that make sense >> Thank you

256
00:26:13,083 --> 00:26:19,167
guys for what you do. What kind
of expectation of privacy do
employees have from next

257
00:26:19,167 --> 00:26:23,875
generation firewalls that are
doing HTTPS inspection. And as
an administer. >> Could you

258
00:26:23,875 --> 00:26:28,333
speak up? >> Could you please?
>> And slow down a little bit.
>> Sorry, what kind of

259
00:26:28,333 --> 00:26:33,042
expectation of privacy do
employees have from next
generation firewalls that are

260
00:26:33,042 --> 00:26:39,875
doing HTTPS inspection in their
workplace. And as an
administrator of one of those

261
00:26:39,875 --> 00:26:44,875
firewalls, is there anything
legal that an admin would need
to know about running one of

262
00:26:44,875 --> 00:26:50,875
those? >> I'll take the first
part of his question. Most of
you when you come to work for a

263
00:26:53,375 --> 00:26:58,750
company, among the very large
piles of documents that you
sign, one of them essentially

264
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:03,958
says that anything they do to
you on their net work is nice
and legal and you say it's okay.

265
00:27:03,958 --> 00:27:09,958
And that includes intercepting
your encrypted chats on their
network. Man in the middling

266
00:27:12,708 --> 00:27:19,167
them and reading them. Networks
such as apple have been doing
this for years on the theory

267
00:27:19,167 --> 00:27:26,500
that this will help them catch
leakers. If you have given up
your rights you have given up

268
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:31,208
your rights. That answers the
first part of the question.
Whether or not there is any

269
00:27:31,208 --> 00:27:36,750
culpability on the part of the
network of administrators, I'm
not a lawyer, and this is not

270
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:43,167
legal advice. But again, if the
employee has already signed a
document saying that anything

271
00:27:43,167 --> 00:27:48,000
you do to me on the net work is
nice and legal, I don't think
that you have any culpability.

272
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:54,875
>> I would add a little bit to
that as a lawyer. I would add it
depends. There are circumstance

273
00:27:54,875 --> 00:27:58,125
sometimes where they don't put
the things in the employee
manual -- what it says in the

274
00:27:58,125 --> 00:28:02,750
manual and how detailed it is.
There are cases from time to
time in which somebody has been

275
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:08,000
able to say what they have done
with actually not part of what I
gave consent to in the employee

276
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:13,458
manual. And under some
circumstances where government
employers if you're trying to --

277
00:28:13,458 --> 00:28:19,208
you may have some additional
rights. So under particular
circumstances, it could happen.

278
00:28:19,208 --> 00:28:23,833
So if there's something where
it's a concrete example and
there's a real question. That

279
00:28:23,833 --> 00:28:30,667
would be the sort of thing to
get specific advice about that
particular situation. >> With

280
00:28:30,667 --> 00:28:34,417
your encrypted e-mail
initiative, what is your
technical goals and are you

281
00:28:34,417 --> 00:28:39,375
working with anyone else's also
working on the same sort of
problem like dark mail? >> What

282
00:28:39,375 --> 00:28:44,500
was the last word you said?
>> Are you working with other
people who are also trying to

283
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:51,375
solve encrypted e-mail like dark
mail or anything like that.
>> So the question was, what's

284
00:28:51,375 --> 00:28:55,917
our encrypted e-mail initiative.
Which makes me -- the way you
ask that makes me think that I

285
00:28:55,917 --> 00:29:01,167
was kind of misleading in my
introduction. Oh so, our
encrypted e-mail project is for

286
00:29:01,167 --> 00:29:07,708
server to server transit
encryption, not end to end like
you encrypting an e-mail to

287
00:29:07,708 --> 00:29:14,458
another person. Which is what a
lot of people use PGP for. So
our encrypted e-mail project

288
00:29:14,458 --> 00:29:21,875
Start TLS Everywhere, is to make
TLS connections between SMTP
servers more robust. I'm not

289
00:29:21,875 --> 00:29:27,875
sure if that's actually what you
wanted to hear about. So I'm
going to stop talking. But if

290
00:29:33,375 --> 00:29:38,000
you do, then ask someone else
will ask me that question. Yeah.
>> Hi, my name's Ethan, I'm a 3L

291
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,917
at UCLA. I really appreciate
your work. Historically when you
look at lot of the civil rights

292
00:29:41,917 --> 00:29:45,167
battles they've been done very
strategically. An organization
will have a very clearly defined

293
00:29:45,167 --> 00:29:48,750
goal, be it gay marriage or
desegregation and they go about
achieving that goal very

294
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:55,417
strategically through test cases
and being very selective. Do you
have any macro goal like that

295
00:29:55,417 --> 00:30:01,292
with corresponding strategy or
are you a more of an attack
everywhere mentality. >> We

296
00:30:01,292 --> 00:30:08,500
absolutely cannot attack
everywhere. We have about 50
people in the organization. And

297
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:14,500
that -- our band width is
constantly filled with being
able to work on -- a small

298
00:30:17,167 --> 00:30:22,042
percentage of the cases. We
definitely try to be strategic
about it. One of the things that

299
00:30:22,042 --> 00:30:25,500
happens with our intake
coordinator -- we're talking
about that process before -- is

300
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:30,375
try to determine whether to take
the case to see if it can be
done within our band width and

301
00:30:30,375 --> 00:30:36,000
also accomplish the goal. Try to
set precedent, try to do
something which is going to have

302
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:41,125
a greater effect then just on
the parties involved and try to
push things forward. I know

303
00:30:41,125 --> 00:30:47,458
there are things which are over
arching our goals. We want to
support fair use. So we take

304
00:30:47,458 --> 00:30:53,667
some cases which will help
solidify the fair use doctrine.
We want to determine that a --

305
00:30:53,667 --> 00:31:00,542
third party doctrine is book.
Third party doctrine is this
notion that you lose your fourth

306
00:31:00,542 --> 00:31:06,458
amendment rights if you store
information with a third party
and then this was brought about

307
00:31:06,458 --> 00:31:12,792
in the late seventies, nowadays
with more and more information
going online. It's very

308
00:31:12,792 --> 00:31:19,500
dangerous doctrine. We're trying
to find the right cases to
undermine that. To come up with

309
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:24,958
a better doctrine for dealing
with information in the digital
age. So yeah, we do operate very

310
00:31:24,958 --> 00:31:29,458
strategically. >> I'll also add
that we also have annual
meetings where we think about

311
00:31:29,458 --> 00:31:33,875
hard and seriously what we have
done in the past year. At least
-- I'm speaking for the legal

312
00:31:33,875 --> 00:31:38,583
team now, precedence wise -- and
each team does this. But
thinking about, for the year,

313
00:31:38,583 --> 00:31:42,500
what have we done in the past
and what really do we want to do
in the next few years? You know,

314
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:46,833
three, five, seven years. So
there's a lot of long-term
thinking. There's a lot of you

315
00:31:46,833 --> 00:31:51,000
know, figuring out where our
resources are best served. And
that long-term thinking, I

316
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:55,625
think, you know, is very
important to figuring out where
we spend our resources. What we

317
00:31:55,625 --> 00:32:02,292
want to do, what we need to do.
And a lot of it, you know, we
get from talking to you guys.

318
00:32:02,292 --> 00:32:06,625
>> I'll give a concrete example,
the Ethiopia case that I'm
working on that I actually

319
00:32:06,625 --> 00:32:11,917
should be writing an opposition
to a motion to dismiss right now
but instead I'm talking to you.

320
00:32:11,917 --> 00:32:18,708
We took that case so -- our
client is an Ethiopian American.
He's a US citizen, he lives in

321
00:32:18,708 --> 00:32:23,625
Silver Spring Maryland, charming
man. We took that case not just
because what the Ethiopian

322
00:32:23,625 --> 00:32:29,375
government did to him sucks, we
took the case because we want to
establish the precedent that

323
00:32:29,375 --> 00:32:34,750
governments can't just spy on
people willy nilly without going
through the legal process. Which

324
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:38,667
is exactly what the Ethiopian
government did to our guy. And
if we can get an American court

325
00:32:38,667 --> 00:32:44,833
to say illegal spying is illegal
and you can't do it, that's
valuable. Not just for our

326
00:32:44,833 --> 00:32:51,250
client, but for everybody. So I
mean, that's a window into the
type of thinking that we do

327
00:32:51,250 --> 00:32:57,458
before we take a case. >> So my
question's more about turning to
the offensive. I'm a malware

328
00:32:57,458 --> 00:33:01,917
researcher. And I've come across
many times where a botnet or a
ransomeware coming out of a

329
00:33:01,917 --> 00:33:06,708
control server, is vulnerable
itself. If I was to say attack
that server with the end goal to

330
00:33:06,708 --> 00:33:12,792
shut down the botnet or disable
the malware network, what legal
ramifications are there and is

331
00:33:12,792 --> 00:33:19,583
it even an option? I don't want
to take it, I want to dish some
back. >> It depends. [Laughing]

332
00:33:19,583 --> 00:33:24,375
>> For a question about your
particular situation, that's
probably one in which we should

333
00:33:24,375 --> 00:33:30,375
be taking offline and having a
-- >> Ill advised! >> I'll spin
on that question a little bit.

334
00:33:32,375 --> 00:33:36,083
Microsoft did something
interesting a couple of weeks
ago. They discovered a botnet

335
00:33:36,083 --> 00:33:43,917
that they didn't like at all.
That was using noIP.org. The
dynamic DNS services. For its

336
00:33:43,917 --> 00:33:47,625
command and control structure.
Which I think is a pretty clever
idea. But that's neither here

337
00:33:47,625 --> 00:33:51,500
nor there. And they decided they
wanted to take it out, and they
were going to take it out by

338
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:57,500
suing noIP. And they did, and
they got the registries to turn
over control of the name servers

339
00:34:00,333 --> 00:34:06,333
to Microsoft. And as a result,
they put five million innocent
dynamic DNS subscribers out of

340
00:34:08,917 --> 00:34:14,917
service for like four days.
That's not the way to do it
buddy. So thank you. [Applause]

341
00:34:20,292 --> 00:34:26,167
>> My name's Shawn. With the
Supreme Court of the United
States weighing in a lot of

342
00:34:26,167 --> 00:34:32,167
these issues where we have crash
course in technology for the
justices. Obviously there's

343
00:34:34,167 --> 00:34:38,500
different ways that they can get
things wrong depending on your
perspective with regard to legal

344
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:43,250
and philosophical matters. But
it seems to me that'll be really
bad if they get things wrong

345
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:51,000
because of technical matters. It
seems to me that their lack of
technological savvy represents a

346
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:56,583
threat to them getting it right.
I'd like to know if you guys
agree. If so, to what magnitude

347
00:34:56,583 --> 00:35:02,042
do you think that risk is. And
do you think there is any way to
mitigate that risk. >> This is

348
00:35:02,042 --> 00:35:08,792
actually something that has been
involved with EFF for many
years. Which is explaining to

349
00:35:08,792 --> 00:35:14,625
judges about technology. In
order to be a judge, you have to
practice law for 20 or 30 years.

350
00:35:14,625 --> 00:35:21,417
So you tend to be of the
generation or two beyond what
the current technologies are.

351
00:35:21,417 --> 00:35:26,792
And this has been one of the
challenges. And we try to do
this by explaining it well. We

352
00:35:26,792 --> 00:35:31,625
have our staff technologists who
will help us out. We're writing
our briefs, trying to explain it

353
00:35:31,625 --> 00:35:37,625
in clear plain English terms,
what these technology -- use
metaphors so the judges will

354
00:35:37,625 --> 00:35:42,750
understand and try to improve
it. Now you may have seen for
some of the decisions the last

355
00:35:42,750 --> 00:35:47,958
couple years by the Supreme
Court where they ask some
questions which indicated that

356
00:35:47,958 --> 00:35:52,625
perhaps they weren't fully
understanding the technology.
Things like, if a pager got two

357
00:35:52,625 --> 00:35:57,708
pages at the same time would
they get a busy signal and this
is about pager technology which

358
00:35:57,708 --> 00:36:04,958
is already a generation behind.
They had -- and in a recent
decision, they talked a lot

359
00:36:04,958 --> 00:36:10,125
about the cloud. Some of them
seemed to understand what that
meant. Some of them maybe not,

360
00:36:10,125 --> 00:36:15,917
not so much. But, nevertheless,
this is something which is very
important. And one -- a very

361
00:36:15,917 --> 00:36:21,000
important sort of, saving grace
which I think that's help come
up with some good decisions out

362
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:25,792
of judges in recent eras, is
they all worked with clerks. And
the clerks are recent law school

363
00:36:25,792 --> 00:36:33,042
grads who are much more familiar
with modern technology than the
judges they work for and can

364
00:36:33,042 --> 00:36:40,083
help explain it to the judges
and understand the briefs about
it. >> Thank you. >> I have

365
00:36:40,083 --> 00:36:44,625
another Riley question. I'm a
graduate student. I deal with
human subjects data. I also have

366
00:36:44,625 --> 00:36:49,333
to go travel internationally a
lot. Does Riley just protect my
cell phone, or does it also

367
00:36:49,333 --> 00:36:55,625
protect my laptop and tablet and
does it protect me at the
border. >> Let me hit that, the

368
00:36:55,625 --> 00:37:03,292
first question is does Riley
protect you beyond cell phone?
Just a little digression about

369
00:37:03,292 --> 00:37:09,083
how sort of the the precedent
system works. So when you have a
case decided, what it means is

370
00:37:09,083 --> 00:37:14,792
just specific to the facts that
are there. The case is about
cell phones. But when you later

371
00:37:14,792 --> 00:37:20,625
have a case about a tablet or
laptop, you can say to the
court, look this is similar to a

372
00:37:20,625 --> 00:37:25,000
cell phone. This is something
that is so similar to a cell
phone because it operates,

373
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:31,333
because like a smart phone, it
can do these functions, it can
-- communicate just like cell

374
00:37:31,333 --> 00:37:35,958
phone can. That you should come
to the same conclusions for this
new technology as you did with

375
00:37:35,958 --> 00:37:41,500
the old technology. And so the
cell phone decision forms a
precedent. And that we were to

376
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:48,625
be using that precedent case by
case to expand its scope so it
hits these other areas. And then

377
00:37:48,625 --> 00:37:55,667
as far as international borders,
your rights are much lessened at
international borders. Coming

378
00:37:55,667 --> 00:38:00,875
in, they are able to do --
instead of needing a warrant
based on probable cause, they

379
00:38:00,875 --> 00:38:06,875
need reasonable suspicions which
is a lower standard -- >> Your
suspicious. >> What? >> I just

380
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:17,083
said your suspicious. >> Very
suspicious. >> Thank you we're
all suspicious. >> Umm does that

381
00:38:17,083 --> 00:38:23,792
answer your question? >> Yes.
Thanks. >> One more thing. EFF
has written a white paper about

382
00:38:23,792 --> 00:38:29,375
your rights at the border. This
is referred to as our border
search white paper. It was

383
00:38:29,375 --> 00:38:34,833
written by my colleagues Seth
Showen and Marsha Hofmann who's
now in private practice. So if

384
00:38:34,833 --> 00:38:39,125
you would like more details
about your rights at the border
just go ahead and take a look at

385
00:38:39,125 --> 00:38:45,125
them. >> Thank you. >> There's
recently a technological
innovation that IC is expanding

386
00:38:49,833 --> 00:38:55,708
the scope of what can be
accomplished through speech.
It's called bit coin. And it

387
00:38:55,708 --> 00:39:01,708
allows a person to memorize a
phrase and there by travel, go
here go there, and keep secret

388
00:39:05,167 --> 00:39:12,458
with an arbitrarily large amount
of money. To communicate that
phrase to another person through

389
00:39:12,458 --> 00:39:18,458
speech alone. And that person
can then, if they were to so
choose, go use a computer to get

390
00:39:21,750 --> 00:39:28,542
access to that money and give it
to somebody else in the same
way. So now that transmitting

391
00:39:28,542 --> 00:39:35,958
money and storing money is a
form of speech, that wasn't true
until four or five years ago

392
00:39:35,958 --> 00:39:43,458
really. The EFF has done cases
where people have encrypted tax
records and things like that.

393
00:39:43,458 --> 00:39:48,083
There -- haven't there been some
EFF cases already that look at
the intersection between a

394
00:39:48,083 --> 00:39:53,708
person's right to privacy and
free speech and finance. But now
that the scope of that

395
00:39:53,708 --> 00:40:00,125
relationship is just being blown
wide open, why is EFF just
staying out of that fight and

396
00:40:00,125 --> 00:40:05,625
why is it -- you know. Why do
they refuse bit coin donations.
Why are they -- >> We take bit

397
00:40:05,625 --> 00:40:13,250
coin donations. >> Where does
that play out? Like the current
regulatory guidance's from the

398
00:40:13,250 --> 00:40:19,250
IRS and Bensin, and New York
department of financial
services. Does EFF even do

399
00:40:21,292 --> 00:40:28,000
regulatory law? Are they going
to start doing regulatory law
because of this intersection?

400
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:34,125
>> Let me clear up a little bit
of confusion. There was a brief
period of time during which EFF

401
00:40:34,125 --> 00:40:40,625
stopped taking bit coin
donations. And the reason why we
did that was because we were not

402
00:40:40,625 --> 00:40:46,625
sure that it was legal for us to
do so. And we needed the time to
consult. >> Modification on

403
00:40:48,667 --> 00:40:54,000
that. It's that there was some
question about the legality and
what we'd like to do is be

404
00:40:54,000 --> 00:41:01,042
counsel for people, and not be
the defendants of such. So we
provide legal services to others

405
00:41:01,042 --> 00:41:05,625
who are in situations and so,
this sometimes means that we are
not the first actor on things

406
00:41:05,625 --> 00:41:10,292
because we want to be in a
position to defend it. We didn't
want to have a situation in

407
00:41:10,292 --> 00:41:14,833
which we're representing
somebody who is using bit coin
and the other side to say, well

408
00:41:14,833 --> 00:41:18,625
you use bit coin yourself.
You're not a serious player
here. You're just trying to

409
00:41:18,625 --> 00:41:23,375
defend your donation stream. And
then after it came to what --
I'll let you finish the rest of

410
00:41:23,375 --> 00:41:27,833
the story. But I wanted to
interject there. >> All right.
We consulted with some trained

411
00:41:27,833 --> 00:41:34,208
legal professionals that spent a
lot of looking at the law of
banking regulation. And once we

412
00:41:34,208 --> 00:41:40,208
felt the chances of us ending up
being the defendant in a lawsuit
rather than somebody's lawyer,

413
00:41:42,375 --> 00:41:47,167
we made another public
announcement saying yes we would
in fact take bit coin. I

414
00:41:47,167 --> 00:41:52,958
actually think that bit coin is
a very important technology.
Primarily because it is a very

415
00:41:52,958 --> 00:42:00,667
powerful tool in the fight
against sort of limiting free
speech by attacking its weakest

416
00:42:00,667 --> 00:42:08,375
link. Which you definitely saw
in the sort of U.S. attacks
against papal payments to wiki

417
00:42:08,375 --> 00:42:16,208
leaks. So this is one of the
reasons why we're excited about
bit coin technology and EFF.

418
00:42:16,208 --> 00:42:23,125
>> Thank you for answering the
question. >> No problem. >> My
question is kind of threefold.

419
00:42:23,125 --> 00:42:30,208
And it all pertains to the blimp
campaign at the Utah data
center. >> Well, try to limit it

420
00:42:30,208 --> 00:42:36,042
to two, sort of twofold
questions. >> Ok, alright. >>
Fold folds two and three

421
00:42:36,042 --> 00:42:41,667
together. [Laughter] >> All
right. How about one and two? Do
you believe that you achieved

422
00:42:41,667 --> 00:42:48,000
your goals with add campaign and
what sort of backlash or
repercussions have you had or

423
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:54,000
challenges in launching that
campaign? >> Which campaign?
>> The Blimp campaign above the

424
00:42:56,833 --> 00:43:00,500
Utah Davis center. >> Oh the
blimp campaign. >> The weather
was a challenge. [Laughing] >> I

425
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:06,375
think I -- I think I can speak
on that for a little bit and
anyone can jump in to. One of

426
00:43:06,375 --> 00:43:10,708
the major goals of that campaign
-- well actually gets back to
the Beth Schwartz question. A

427
00:43:10,708 --> 00:43:16,667
big aspect of that came was
increasing education around
that. We know that a lot of you

428
00:43:16,667 --> 00:43:21,417
guys know about the NSA, it's
really reaching out to the next
step and reaching out to the

429
00:43:21,417 --> 00:43:28,667
general public. To the people
who sometimes don't know what
HTTPS is. So that campaign was a

430
00:43:28,667 --> 00:43:33,667
pretty huge educational campaign
around that issue. We saw
massive hits around it, we saw

431
00:43:33,667 --> 00:43:38,625
massive sharing around it. That
is one of the main campaigns to
increase education awareness

432
00:43:38,625 --> 00:43:43,458
about NSA spying and especially
around the bills in congress
too. We released a score card.

433
00:43:43,458 --> 00:43:48,000
Score card is -- methodology
around where senators and
congressman and congresswomen

434
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:54,000
lawmakers rank. And that stopped
the spying.org. And so that
blimp campaign was part of that

435
00:43:57,958 --> 00:44:04,583
larger roll out to make sure
that we pass strong reform that
we fix at the minimum one of

436
00:44:04,583 --> 00:44:12,042
these programs in the
short-term. And making sure that
things get done. We've seen just

437
00:44:12,042 --> 00:44:15,875
crazy things over the past year.
And we need to fix a lot of
them. So it's pushing that

438
00:44:15,875 --> 00:44:20,833
envelope further and getting
people to act. Getting congress
to act. And increasing awareness

439
00:44:20,833 --> 00:44:26,833
around that. >> Thank you.
>> You guys are great. Thank you
for your courage. >> Thanks. >>

440
00:44:29,583 --> 00:44:35,583
The question I have is we've
seen a lot of mob enthusiasm for
net neutrality. And while I

441
00:44:39,542 --> 00:44:45,083
think that's great, I have a
concern when congress makes
bills about the internet. And I

442
00:44:45,083 --> 00:44:51,292
wanted to run a couple of lines
from these bills by you. In the
most recent bill, it says that

443
00:44:51,292 --> 00:44:53,292
fixed broadband providers may
not block lawful content.
Application services or

444
00:44:53,292 --> 00:44:55,292
non-harmful devices. And then in
the unreasonable discrimination,
it also says fixed broad band

445
00:44:55,292 --> 00:45:00,250
providers may not unreasonably
discriminate in transmitting
lawful network traffic. It seems

446
00:45:00,250 --> 00:45:07,542
like by making those statements,
they're also implying that they
will have someone at these broad

447
00:45:07,542 --> 00:45:13,542
band providers watching to make
sure everything is lawful in
order to block unlawful content.

448
00:45:16,042 --> 00:45:22,042
I was just curious, what is your
opinion on some of the recent
net neutrality bills? And do you

449
00:45:35,167 --> 00:45:41,458
guys have a congressmen or two
that maybe has a little more
technical chops than some of the

450
00:45:41,458 --> 00:45:48,500
people in there that can have a
voice in amending some of these
bills and all of this? >> Yeah

451
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:53,833
sure, I guess the kind of my
initial response is it's very
hard to do a spot on legislative

452
00:45:53,833 --> 00:46:00,125
analysis right up on stage. I do
do that at some times but it's
probably a little bit hard. That

453
00:46:00,125 --> 00:46:05,125
language sounds actually more
like from some of the computer
security and cyber security

454
00:46:05,125 --> 00:46:10,583
bills than an actual net
neutrality bill. For the second
part of your question, I'd like

455
00:46:10,583 --> 00:46:17,000
to take a step back a little bit
because right now, we hear a lot
of rumblings that congress is

456
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:20,500
going to do something on net
neutrality -- or not even do
something, but there are bills

457
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:24,917
in congress about net
neutrality. And that does not
equate to congress doing

458
00:46:24,917 --> 00:46:30,042
something on net neutrality. We
have a lot of PR bills released.
We have a lot of bills that are

459
00:46:30,042 --> 00:46:36,042
there for press release splash
and to make news. Right now net
neutrality is really in the

460
00:46:38,167 --> 00:46:41,708
regulatory phase and they're
trying to figure that out. We
had over a million comments

461
00:46:41,708 --> 00:46:48,542
filed on the net neutrality and
where it's going on -- net
neutrality reclassification and

462
00:46:48,542 --> 00:46:56,042
where the public is at and where
the FCC is at. Congress right
now I think is watching. But

463
00:46:56,042 --> 00:47:01,292
congress is -- I don't really
think congress is going to be
passing anything straight up on

464
00:47:01,292 --> 00:47:05,750
net neutrality. I think the
important aspect -- especially
what you seen the EFF focus on

465
00:47:05,750 --> 00:47:11,375
and our resources is, around the
FCC, the comment system and
community wi-fi and getting

466
00:47:11,375 --> 00:47:19,083
those things out there. We'll
see, congress, as there want to
sometimes they react quickly and

467
00:47:19,083 --> 00:47:22,625
will throw something on the
floor and try and move
something. But right now net

468
00:47:22,625 --> 00:47:25,750
neutrality is really in the
regulatory aspect and we're
trying to hammer it down there

469
00:47:25,750 --> 00:47:31,750
and get our opinions and our
thoughts out there. >> All right
umm, what is the -- I guess

470
00:47:34,583 --> 00:47:40,583
current state of case law around
IMSI catchers or stingrays. And
what can we do to change that

471
00:47:42,750 --> 00:47:48,750
case law so that it's not as god
awfully scary as it was last I
looked? >> I'm actually not sure

472
00:47:51,625 --> 00:47:58,542
of the answer of that question.
>> One of the things we're doing
around IMSI catchers is we're

473
00:47:58,542 --> 00:48:04,500
filing a bunch of FOIA law suits
to try and get municipalities
and agencies to fork over the

474
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:09,208
records of when they use IMSI
catchers. We think they use them
a whole lot more than they admit

475
00:48:09,208 --> 00:48:15,208
to. So we are trying to do that.
Hanee Facurey our criminal law
attorney is not on the panel.

476
00:48:19,792 --> 00:48:25,458
>> In general on IMSI catchers I
guess, some of the question is
how can you safely do research

477
00:48:25,458 --> 00:48:31,458
on IMSI catchers? I guess point
back to when Christian Pagent
demoed a IMSI catcher at Def Con

478
00:48:33,625 --> 00:48:39,792
a couple years ago. We were able
to get to a circumstance where
it could be researched within a

479
00:48:39,792 --> 00:48:45,333
comfortable -- within the bounds
of the law. There are many laws
about using these kinds of

480
00:48:45,333 --> 00:48:49,125
devices. So if you're doing
research on them, it is
definitely a good time to get

481
00:48:49,125 --> 00:48:53,292
some legal advice to make sure
you're doing it in a safe way.
>> I would also add that the

482
00:48:53,292 --> 00:48:58,458
current state is unknown. The
stuff that's actively being
litigated, I think just in the

483
00:48:58,458 --> 00:49:04,333
past couple months. Our point
criminal defense guy has filed
amicus briefs on this. There's a

484
00:49:04,333 --> 00:49:11,000
large question as to the breadth
of information and the breadth
of call detail records and

485
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:15,750
information that they're
collecting on innocent people or
on non-suspects. So I think the

486
00:49:15,750 --> 00:49:21,083
current state is cloudy. That's
why we're here. We're here to
file those amicus briefs and to

487
00:49:21,083 --> 00:49:26,542
make it less cloudy and clear
for the judges. >> I'll spin on
that a little bit. This is going

488
00:49:26,542 --> 00:49:33,625
to get legal geeky for just a
sec. In the American legal
justice system, when law

489
00:49:33,625 --> 00:49:37,667
enforcement come seeking a
warrant, they usually go to
magistrate judges, which are the

490
00:49:37,667 --> 00:49:42,458
lowest level of federal judges
in the United States. They are
not appointed for life. They are

491
00:49:42,458 --> 00:49:46,917
not full article three judges.
But they sign warrant
applications. We've seen in the

492
00:49:46,917 --> 00:49:53,750
last year what's being referred
to as a magistrate revolution.
We've seen magistrates rejecting

493
00:49:53,750 --> 00:50:00,917
search warrant applications a
lot. And it's great and they are
actively seeking amicus

494
00:50:00,917 --> 00:50:08,208
participation from groups like
EFF and ACLU. And I think we
need to see a lot more of that.

495
00:50:08,208 --> 00:50:12,792
>> Okay. I've got a pair of
questions. One on the
international side and one on

496
00:50:12,792 --> 00:50:20,750
the judicial side. So I'm both a
U.S. and UK citizen. Does that
make me more or less protected

497
00:50:20,750 --> 00:50:26,958
from U.S. and EU surveillance?
So maybe I am -- [Laughing] >>
So yeah, it's serious. Maybe one

498
00:50:26,958 --> 00:50:33,958
can say awe he's EU. Nah we can
just take his stuff anyways.
What happens there? And then

499
00:50:33,958 --> 00:50:39,750
secondly on the judicial side --
so for Riley, just as an example
whenever we see the government

500
00:50:39,750 --> 00:50:44,375
pushing very strange
interpretations of what
constituted reasonable searches,

501
00:50:44,375 --> 00:50:48,958
is that consistent across the
entire judicial department or
are there any particular

502
00:50:48,958 --> 00:50:53,583
instances where they say no,
that's entirely reasonable were
going to abandon trying to push

503
00:50:53,583 --> 00:51:00,083
some strange interpretation of
what is a legal search. Thanks.
>> Should I take the first half?

504
00:51:00,083 --> 00:51:03,875
>> Response to that. The first
question is who do you trust
more? The NSA or DCHQ?

505
00:51:03,875 --> 00:51:11,167
[Laughing] >> But Eva has a
proper answer I asume.
>> Meanwhile back in proper

506
00:51:11,167 --> 00:51:17,167
answer land. [Laughing] >> So
very often when you hear
activism around opposing illegal

507
00:51:20,208 --> 00:51:27,583
NSA surveillance, you hear very
sort of American centric
language. Which is the NSA is

508
00:51:27,583 --> 00:51:33,583
spying on Americans. On American
citizens on, you know, blue
blooded whatever the hell. And

509
00:51:36,375 --> 00:51:41,833
this is not okay. And the
implication is, that if you are
not an American citizen -- if

510
00:51:41,833 --> 00:51:48,542
you are not an American you have
no rights. You're left out in
the cold. Screw you. The NSA can

511
00:51:48,542 --> 00:51:54,542
spy on you all you want. This is
not true. This is not even
remotely true. One of the

512
00:51:57,125 --> 00:52:02,833
reasons why you hear so much
rhetoric around how terrible it
is that the NSA is spying on

513
00:52:02,833 --> 00:52:08,833
Americans is because Americans
are specifically outside of the
NSA's remit. So it is the most

514
00:52:11,250 --> 00:52:17,583
clear cut case of the NSA
breaking the law. But, just
because you are a non U.S.

515
00:52:17,583 --> 00:52:23,500
person, does not mean that you
don't have rights. And there are
a couple of points, a very

516
00:52:23,500 --> 00:52:30,375
important points that EFF has
been making in this area. One of
them is in fact our Ethiopia

517
00:52:30,375 --> 00:52:37,375
lawsuit. Where we are making the
point that if you are a
government and you want to spy

518
00:52:37,375 --> 00:52:44,208
on somebody in another country,
you are still subject to the
laws of that country. And this

519
00:52:44,208 --> 00:52:51,042
applies in the United States and
it applies when the U.S.
government wants to spy in other

520
00:52:51,042 --> 00:52:57,083
countries as well. So we're
trying to set that precedent.
EFF was also instrumental in

521
00:52:57,083 --> 00:53:03,375
putting together a set of
principles. The 13 principles on
the application of human rights

522
00:53:03,375 --> 00:53:08,917
to mass surveillance. And
hundreds of organizations all
over the world have signed on to

523
00:53:08,917 --> 00:53:14,875
the principles. Which you can
find at
www.necessaryandproportionate.or

524
00:53:14,875 --> 00:53:21,750
g. Which is a very long and
awkward URL. >> And I can't
spell it. >> And one of the

525
00:53:21,750 --> 00:53:27,625
points that we make there is
essentially that you are still
protected by international law

526
00:53:27,625 --> 00:53:33,917
if you are a non U.S. person.
You still have privacy rights.
And the governments should only

527
00:53:33,917 --> 00:53:39,875
be using mass surveillance in a
way that is necessary and
proportionate to the task at

528
00:53:39,875 --> 00:53:45,875
hand. And what the NSA is doing
right now we're arguing is well
outside of these guidelines.

529
00:53:48,375 --> 00:53:54,375
>> Thank you. >> Hello again.
How does the privacy law scale
to space and other worlds? >>

530
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:07,417
That's a great question.
>> There is a an international
treaty on space. It has some

531
00:54:07,417 --> 00:54:14,417
rules about weaponization of
space and so on. But I have not
really examined it for how the

532
00:54:14,417 --> 00:54:20,417
privacy laws -- but I would sure
hope that if we are going to
other worlds -- to going to

533
00:54:22,792 --> 00:54:28,792
outside of this one, that we
maintain a society of the future
that respects civil liberties

534
00:54:32,083 --> 00:54:38,250
wherever we go. [Applause]
>> Hi, in the last five years,
there's been a proliferation of

535
00:54:38,250 --> 00:54:42,958
on officer video systems
throughout the country -- >> On
one what? >> On off surveillance

536
00:54:42,958 --> 00:54:46,542
video systems. Cameras the
police officers wear on their
person. So then when they go

537
00:54:46,542 --> 00:54:50,917
into somebody's home or into a
business, by contrast let's say
a dash cam that's limited to the

538
00:54:50,917 --> 00:54:55,458
field of view in front of a
vehicle, or a CCTV on the inside
or outside of a business, now

539
00:54:55,458 --> 00:55:00,000
law enforcement has the capacity
to enter into a private
residence or at least some sort

540
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:05,917
of a private domicile. Does the
EFF have a stance on law
enforcement wearing on officer

541
00:55:05,917 --> 00:55:11,750
video. And also what are kind of
the restrictions about chain of
custody. And now we have storage

542
00:55:11,750 --> 00:55:16,292
medias or mediums that can
basically store evidence
indefinitely, are there any

543
00:55:16,292 --> 00:55:23,750
concerns applied to that as
well? >> I'll hit on the first
question. No matter what

544
00:55:23,750 --> 00:55:29,292
technology the government is
using, they need to use it
within the bounds of the

545
00:55:29,292 --> 00:55:34,500
constitution. So if they have a
camera on them inside of your
house, they still need to have a

546
00:55:34,500 --> 00:55:38,958
warrant to go inside the house.
And where this is actually come
up most in the law has been

547
00:55:38,958 --> 00:55:44,833
places like using heat imagers
to look through walls. Getting
that difference between

548
00:55:44,833 --> 00:55:49,500
something that you're doing
outside of a house and being
able to see information that's

549
00:55:49,500 --> 00:55:55,125
inside that protected place. We
want to make sure all of these
technologies are being used

550
00:55:55,125 --> 00:55:59,375
within the bounds of the
constitution and where they are
seeing into a protected area, in

551
00:55:59,375 --> 00:56:03,458
a place where you have a
reasonable expectation of
privacy that you are able to

552
00:56:03,458 --> 00:56:09,083
protect that reasonable
expectation. And the, sort of
the other, I guess tension that

553
00:56:09,083 --> 00:56:14,167
comes in there a lot as new
technologies are being used,
where previously there were

554
00:56:14,167 --> 00:56:20,125
things that were very difficult
for the police to do by just a
sheer like challenge of having

555
00:56:20,125 --> 00:56:26,125
the number of officers necessary
to do it. So this has come up in
the cases of GPS location vs.

556
00:56:29,042 --> 00:56:33,375
--well we could have an officer
drive around and follow after
somebody but now we have this

557
00:56:33,375 --> 00:56:38,375
new technology that enables us
to do that. In that case, the
Supreme Court said that the fact

558
00:56:38,375 --> 00:56:42,875
that you might be able to do it
by having somebody go around.
You couldn't practically do

559
00:56:42,875 --> 00:56:48,042
that. So this doesn't mean it's
always okay to use the
technology to replicate that. So

560
00:56:48,042 --> 00:56:54,833
likewise they might say that the
difference you see the camera on
and off service. They couldn't

561
00:56:54,833 --> 00:56:59,750
remember everything that they
saw. But now we have the camera
to be sure. But on the whole,

562
00:56:59,750 --> 00:57:05,667
the real question is whether
they can go into a place that
require a warrant if they come

563
00:57:05,667 --> 00:57:11,667
to your door, come back with a
warrant, whether they have a
camera or not. >> Thank you.

564
00:57:15,958 --> 00:57:21,958
>> Hi. I've got a two parter on
the practical implications of a
technology lawsuit. So, when you

565
00:57:25,208 --> 00:57:30,208
work with tech all day, a lot of
things could seem common sense
there's just simple facts of how

566
00:57:30,208 --> 00:57:35,750
the system works. But to a
laymen and the court, it seems
like complete -- like

567
00:57:35,750 --> 00:57:41,750
impenetrable to them. And I
wondered if there was any way to
think about when expert

568
00:57:41,750 --> 00:57:47,750
testimony would be required in a
lawsuit. >> Expert testimony is
almost never required in a

569
00:57:50,667 --> 00:57:57,542
lawsuit. There are some very
obscure areas where it is. It is
required that -- those are rare.

570
00:57:57,542 --> 00:58:02,958
And especially in criminal law,
expert testimony is almost never
required. That said, it's often

571
00:58:02,958 --> 00:58:10,458
extremely helpful. And the more
the better. If you are a
technical expert and you're

572
00:58:10,458 --> 00:58:18,083
willing to testify for free in
EFF cases, e-mail us.
Info@EFF.org. >> So then is it

573
00:58:18,083 --> 00:58:22,917
just a matter of having a lawyer
that's willing to understand the
technology deep enough to make

574
00:58:22,917 --> 00:58:28,333
the argument? >> Yup. >> And
then my second part was what are
the implications on winning a

575
00:58:28,333 --> 00:58:34,125
case if you do need a technical
expert? And also on bankrupting
a person that has to hire the

576
00:58:34,125 --> 00:58:40,500
technical expert? >> What was
that last part? Bankruptcy?
>> So like, yeah, if you --

577
00:58:40,500 --> 00:58:46,125
would it just be an incredibly
expensive ordeal that not an
average person could hope to do.

578
00:58:46,125 --> 00:58:52,625
>> That's one of the things that
we try to resolve. By providing
free legal services to people

579
00:58:52,625 --> 00:58:59,208
who otherwise could not afford
to do a defense. If you have to
pay for high quality lawyers who

580
00:58:59,208 --> 00:59:04,042
understand these technologies,
there are a number of them out
there. They'll charge five or

581
00:59:04,042 --> 00:59:09,167
$600 an hour. They're great. But
most people can't afford them.
And there are a number of

582
00:59:09,167 --> 00:59:14,500
circumstances where it's been
really satisfying to get into a
case where the other side really

583
00:59:14,500 --> 00:59:19,750
thought they could come in there
and brow beat somebody, just
blow them away because they have

584
00:59:19,750 --> 00:59:26,125
so much money and resources and
then be on their side and we're
working for free and we get

585
00:59:26,125 --> 00:59:31,833
experts to come in to work for
free and are able to match them
toe to toe where they are trying

586
00:59:31,833 --> 00:59:37,583
to drive somebody under the
ground with the sheer weight of
money. It's very satisfying when

587
00:59:37,583 --> 00:59:43,583
that doesn't work. [Applause]
>> Again, concrete example from
the Ethiopia case, we have a

588
00:59:47,083 --> 00:59:53,083
whole stable of computer science
Ph.D.s from citizen lab, from
the University of California at

589
00:59:56,000 --> 01:00:00,167
Berkeley, the University of
Toronto Monk school who are
doing top notch computer

590
01:00:00,167 --> 01:00:05,583
forensics for us for free.
Thanks guys. >> First of all,
I'd like to thank the EFF for

591
01:00:05,583 --> 01:00:09,958
all the good work that you guys
do. And secondly, I have a big
question for you, in regards to

592
01:00:09,958 --> 01:00:16,500
Lavabit, and the talks that have
occurred here at Def Con, from
the founder of Lavabit. Has EFF

593
01:00:16,500 --> 01:00:21,042
done anything, or do you plan to
do anything to try to address
the legal issues that

594
01:00:21,042 --> 01:00:25,917
constitutional issues, really
that the founder of Lavabit face
where he wasn't able to tell

595
01:00:25,917 --> 01:00:30,500
people his ordeal except the
attorney that he was engaging.
And the fact that the government

596
01:00:30,500 --> 01:00:34,917
was aware of the fact he was
engaging certain people for
legal advice and all the issues

597
01:00:34,917 --> 01:00:42,583
surrounding it? >> So we of
course have been following the
Lavabit case very closely. We

598
01:00:42,583 --> 01:00:50,542
helped refer Ladar to a former
EFFer Marsha Hofmann who was
able to help him out. Umm, on

599
01:00:50,542 --> 01:00:56,833
the broader issues, one of the
things we have been trying to do
with our national security

600
01:00:56,833 --> 01:01:02,833
letter case is to try and
establish that silence enforced
by these lawyers where you can't

601
01:01:06,833 --> 01:01:12,000
tell somebody that you received
a national security letter is a
violation of the first

602
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:18,958
amendment. We're trying to get
it so people can talk about the
process that they received and

603
01:01:18,958 --> 01:01:24,417
can be able to fight back
against it more effectively. We
umm, we're very concerned about

604
01:01:24,417 --> 01:01:29,000
the case. We ended up filing an
Amicus brief because of the
implications that were coming

605
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:34,417
out from the notion that they
could get the key to everybody.
That, you know, in order to go

606
01:01:34,417 --> 01:01:39,625
after a particular target, you
get the key that decrypts
everybody's e-mail, and that's

607
01:01:39,625 --> 01:01:45,417
far too raw. It is not targeted
and you have to trust the
government that they're not

608
01:01:45,417 --> 01:01:50,375
going to misuse that key.
Unfortunately that case did not
go the way that I thought it

609
01:01:50,375 --> 01:01:56,375
should have. Or the way I would
have hoped. Or you know, we're
there for the next fight as

610
01:01:58,542 --> 01:02:05,542
well. >> Thank you. >> Hello. So
a while ago Europe decided that
we had a right to be forgotten.

611
01:02:05,542 --> 01:02:10,667
And I think it was recently
declared technically infeasible.
I was just wondering if the EFF

612
01:02:10,667 --> 01:02:18,167
was involved in that and what's
your opinions, if you can
disclose them? >> Oh yeah. So

613
01:02:18,167 --> 01:02:24,167
recently the European court of
justice made a terrible ruling
regarding a gentleman in Spain

614
01:02:27,708 --> 01:02:35,542
who wanted to have some
information about his previous
legal dealings. I think the sale

615
01:02:35,542 --> 01:02:42,917
of the home of his in a
bankruptcy case removed from
Google search as part of an

616
01:02:42,917 --> 01:02:48,333
implementation of the right to
be forgotten. And the European
court of justice moved this. Not

617
01:02:48,333 --> 01:02:54,333
only could they require Google
to do so, but that they would
start requiring Google to comply

618
01:02:56,500 --> 01:03:04,250
with a variety of requests. From
people all over the European
union to simply have things

619
01:03:04,250 --> 01:03:10,250
removed from search if they
simply didn't want them there
anymore. Google is actually not

620
01:03:13,083 --> 01:03:20,708
a big fan of this ruling.
Because as you can imagine,
having to hire a whole bunch of

621
01:03:20,708 --> 01:03:26,708
people to process all of these
requests is an enormous pain in
the ass. It may seem easier to

622
01:03:26,708 --> 01:03:32,708
simply, grant them all, but then
you're engaged in this sort of
mass censorship, which we think

623
01:03:35,500 --> 01:03:42,833
is extremely problematic. So one
of the things that we've been
working with Google and other

624
01:03:42,833 --> 01:03:50,417
search engines on, is we've been
talking about -- talking with
them about what they can say

625
01:03:50,417 --> 01:03:55,292
about the things that they have
removed from their search
engines in response to the right

626
01:03:55,292 --> 01:03:59,417
to be forgotten. And we're going
to see if we can do some sort of
analysis about what is being

627
01:03:59,417 --> 01:04:02,750
taken down, how it's being taken
down. And why it is being taken
down. Because we have a theory

628
01:04:02,750 --> 01:04:08,750
that when you grant people the
right to censor content about
themselves, you're really only

629
01:04:14,833 --> 01:04:21,333
creating a tool for the powerful
to groom their own image. But
this is not really an argument

630
01:04:21,333 --> 01:04:26,708
that we can make without facts.
And the European court of
justice is actually struggling

631
01:04:26,708 --> 01:04:31,542
very hard to keep the search
engines from being able to
publish anything about what

632
01:04:31,542 --> 01:04:36,708
they're taking down, not just
how many things they're taking
down, but who they are taking

633
01:04:36,708 --> 01:04:41,167
down -- them down in response to
and why. Because they feel that
this will simply create a

634
01:04:41,167 --> 01:04:47,250
Streisand effect. Where you have
essentially done everything but
tell them, hey, here's where you

635
01:04:47,250 --> 01:04:53,958
find the information. So there's
that sort of struggle between
these two forces right now. It

636
01:04:53,958 --> 01:05:00,042
is my hope that the European
court of justice will come to
understand that this is simply

637
01:05:00,042 --> 01:05:05,417
not a feasible ruling that it
doesn't really protect anyone.
But people who are already

638
01:05:05,417 --> 01:05:12,250
powerful. And I hope that they
backtrack on it entirely. And
this is something that the EFF

639
01:05:12,250 --> 01:05:16,167
has really been working on in
its international activism.
>> One of the important things

640
01:05:16,167 --> 01:05:21,792
to remember about the right to
be forgotten ruling, is that the
Spanish gentleman at issue sued

641
01:05:21,792 --> 01:05:28,042
both Google and the publisher of
the newspaper to get the article
itself taken down. And the

642
01:05:28,042 --> 01:05:34,042
newspaper won. So the article
still exists but Google lost and
it was de-indexed. So it's not

643
01:05:37,625 --> 01:05:43,792
as bad as it could be. >> I'm
not sure that I would
characterize it as not as bad as

644
01:05:43,792 --> 01:05:49,750
it could be. I think one of the
-- >> It's aweful. >> One of the
lines from the ruling is

645
01:05:49,750 --> 01:05:56,042
essentially we could not get the
paper to take this down because
that would clearly be illegal,

646
01:05:56,042 --> 01:06:01,042
and so we're going after the
search engine because we think
it would be easier to implement

647
01:06:01,042 --> 01:06:06,917
censorship in this way. And I
think creating a new centralized
form of censorship that is

648
01:06:06,917 --> 01:06:12,917
entirely up to very large search
engines is a terrible idea.
>> Yes. >> Just in case my

649
01:06:15,542 --> 01:06:21,542
thoughts were not clear on this
subject. >> One of the best
benefits of the ideal of

650
01:06:25,333 --> 01:06:30,833
electronic freedom that I can
imagine as an American citizen
would be to be able to go online

651
01:06:30,833 --> 01:06:37,417
on some government web site and
authenticate my
self-appropriately and see every

652
01:06:37,417 --> 01:06:43,875
database the government has that
has my name in it. Not the
contents in particular, because

653
01:06:43,875 --> 01:06:48,833
that would -- my understanding
would be more likely -- freedom
of information act where you can

654
01:06:48,833 --> 01:06:54,250
request the contents of a
document once you know that the
document exists. But there are

655
01:06:54,250 --> 01:06:57,833
situations where you don't even
know that the government is
tracking you, for instance, like

656
01:06:57,833 --> 01:07:02,292
on the no fly lists. Which my
understanding is, you don't have
the right to even know that

657
01:07:02,292 --> 01:07:06,542
you're on it until you get the
hand in your face at the airport
saying you can't get on the

658
01:07:06,542 --> 01:07:13,625
plane. And more recently, the
secret lists that the veteran's
administration had about,

659
01:07:13,625 --> 01:07:19,250
cooking the books on how soon
they were actually getting to
patients and stuff like that. Is

660
01:07:19,250 --> 01:07:26,750
there anything like that being
tracked as a form of electronic
freedom and do you know of any

661
01:07:26,750 --> 01:07:34,125
other secret lists that the
government has that the average,
you know, that are being tracked

662
01:07:34,125 --> 01:07:39,708
as an issue that the average
conscientious citizen might not
have furloughed? >> I guess --

663
01:07:39,708 --> 01:07:47,042
no. [Laughing] >> I could answer
a little bit about the list of
lists. Actually a while back, we

664
01:07:47,042 --> 01:07:54,167
did a freedom of information act
request to get from the FBI at
least more information about

665
01:07:54,167 --> 01:08:01,375
some of their databases. We were
looking at the investigative
data warehouse. Which was there

666
01:08:01,375 --> 01:08:08,500
attempt to combine a bunch of
these lists together in one
place. But, it probably is going

667
01:08:08,500 --> 01:08:13,708
to be very difficult to get the
full list of lists because they
will often in the freedom of

668
01:08:13,708 --> 01:08:18,542
information act litigation say
that this information is secret.
And therefore cannot be

669
01:08:18,542 --> 01:08:25,750
revealed. You can go and foray
yourself and try to get the
records that the government has

670
01:08:25,750 --> 01:08:33,208
about you. But the most
interesting ones probably will
-- they will not give you or

671
01:08:33,208 --> 01:08:37,542
even indicate that they have.
>> Yeah just expand a little bit
on that. And then Nate if you

672
01:08:37,542 --> 01:08:42,583
want to talk -- I think when
we're talking about lists and
lists of lists, it depends on

673
01:08:42,583 --> 01:08:50,083
who you're asking. The domestic
non-intelligent side, they at
least published, they being DHS

674
01:08:50,083 --> 01:08:54,708
-- and this is not for criminal
investigations. We know about
the no fly list because they

675
01:08:54,708 --> 01:08:58,833
have to publish the list they
keep when they're keeping a
system of records. They have to

676
01:08:58,833 --> 01:09:06,500
put out this notice. The notice
does not go into precise detail.
It does tell you the data they

677
01:09:06,500 --> 01:09:11,250
aim to collect, often retention
periods, who they're going to
share it with. And more

678
01:09:11,250 --> 01:09:18,958
information like that. So kind
of the crazy list at the DHS we
know about. It's really just the

679
01:09:18,958 --> 01:09:24,500
intelligence list. Because it
goes beyond the privacy act,
which mandates DHS do those

680
01:09:24,500 --> 01:09:31,250
lists. It goes beyond the FOIA,
the freedom of information act
to request where they have a lot

681
01:09:31,250 --> 01:09:36,125
of the -- the information we
found out right from Snowden and
from the leaks. So that's kind

682
01:09:36,125 --> 01:09:42,250
of my answer. You have to
separate it out. We are going to
know probably a lot of these

683
01:09:42,250 --> 01:09:47,083
civilian agency lists. We will
probably not know a lot about
the intelligence agency lists

684
01:09:47,083 --> 01:09:51,625
unless courage becomes
contagious and there are more
lists of lists out there. Umm,

685
01:09:51,625 --> 01:09:56,000
and the criminal investigatory
list. We may know some of them,
but there is always going to be

686
01:09:56,000 --> 01:10:02,292
some hidden lists. And I think
that sums up the nuance of how
we approach these things and how

687
01:10:02,292 --> 01:10:08,917
we approach what information the
government is collecting. >> My
question dove tails on what you

688
01:10:08,917 --> 01:10:15,000
were just saying. Given what is
apparently an increasing trend
of aggressively prosecuting

689
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:20,167
federal leakers is the process
of protecting federal whistle
blowers broken, can it be fixed

690
01:10:20,167 --> 01:10:24,875
and what are the implications
for all of our -- for the next
potential Snowden. >> It is

691
01:10:24,875 --> 01:10:31,417
totally broken. >> It is totally
broken. >> Agreed. >> And it's
broken in particular -- I'll

692
01:10:31,417 --> 01:10:36,000
answer what I can and you guys
can jump in. It is particularly
broken on the intelligence side.

693
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:42,000
You know, we have seen all of
the leakers, to be honest with
you Rick, Thomas Drake. You

694
01:10:44,583 --> 01:10:52,250
can't go -- you are forced to go
up through a system that at
least from the history and the

695
01:10:52,250 --> 01:10:59,417
evidence we have, is intended to
and does neglect warnings from
lower individuals. People have

696
01:10:59,417 --> 01:11:04,333
warned their managers. You know,
we have Thomas Drake saying and
Snowden saying we warned these

697
01:11:04,333 --> 01:11:11,417
manager and what happens is they
don't listen. That is a huge
problem. Then on the other side

698
01:11:11,417 --> 01:11:14,417
of that, you have the
congressional intelligence
committees, who are supposed to

699
01:11:14,417 --> 01:11:20,292
be over seeing these things and
who are supposed to be insuring
that whistle blowers and leakers

700
01:11:20,292 --> 01:11:25,875
can go to them. But again, we
see that not happening and that
doesn't happen because the

701
01:11:25,875 --> 01:11:30,958
system is broken. There are few,
if any, protections. I believe
there are even no protections.

702
01:11:30,958 --> 01:11:37,792
>> There are protections for
whistle blowers on the books.
They're just not strong enough.

703
01:11:37,792 --> 01:11:44,000
That they are basically designed
to allow people to speak to the
government inspector general

704
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:51,250
about problems that they are
seeing or to a make a complaint
to the government. And sometimes

705
01:11:51,250 --> 01:11:55,500
there's a concern that those
complaints will not be acted
upon and so sometimes the

706
01:11:55,500 --> 01:12:01,083
whistle blowers are not
satisfied with internally
whistle blowing. There is a

707
01:12:01,083 --> 01:12:05,500
really great site,
whistleblowers.org that actually
discusses what protections are

708
01:12:05,500 --> 01:12:10,667
out there. So there are some,
but it's just not enough to give
a real assurance to somebody

709
01:12:10,667 --> 01:12:14,625
that wants to blow the whistle
that they will be able to do so
both with protections and

710
01:12:14,625 --> 01:12:18,792
effectively. >> Unfortunately, a
lot of the protections to
whistle blowers apply only to

711
01:12:18,792 --> 01:12:24,667
federal government employees and
do not extend to contractors.
Snowden obviously was a

712
01:12:24,667 --> 01:12:29,042
contractor. Not a federal
government employee. So a lot of
the whistle blower protections

713
01:12:29,042 --> 01:12:34,583
that are on the books for
employees didn't even apply to
him. >> And last of all, if you

714
01:12:34,583 --> 01:12:39,083
think things look grim for
whistle blowing and reporting on
whistle blowing in the United

715
01:12:39,083 --> 01:12:46,292
States, try Australia, our
partner in the five Is which is
currently considering

716
01:12:46,292 --> 01:12:51,708
legislation that would
essentially make it illegal to
report on documents which have

717
01:12:51,708 --> 01:12:57,708
come to light on the subject of
national security in Australia
if they are made public by

718
01:13:02,250 --> 01:13:07,333
leakers. And that's an attack
not just on leakers but on
journalism itself. >> Is there

719
01:13:07,333 --> 01:13:13,333
anything we can do to fix it?
>> Certainly there are things to
try. One of the things is, there

720
01:13:15,375 --> 01:13:22,125
is one on -- the journalism
front here in the United States,
there's a really good case

721
01:13:22,125 --> 01:13:26,875
called Bartnickey which is
addressing a circumstance in
which a radio station got some

722
01:13:26,875 --> 01:13:31,958
information that was unlawfully
obtained. They published it on
the radio, peole went after them

723
01:13:31,958 --> 01:13:37,042
and that -- for publishing that
and went up to the Supreme Court
and the Supreme Court said

724
01:13:37,042 --> 01:13:42,125
because that information came to
them through no fault of their
own, they had a first amendment

725
01:13:42,125 --> 01:13:49,875
right to put that news out
there. So we haven't seen a lot
of cases in which after the

726
01:13:49,875 --> 01:13:54,667
information has been received by
a -- newspapers or reporters
where they brought cases against

727
01:13:54,667 --> 01:14:02,000
the newspapers and reporters. So
that's been helpful. And then
for some of the suggestions that

728
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:07,458
have been made, the espionage
act could be used against
whistle blowers. I think that if

729
01:14:07,458 --> 01:14:13,667
that actually was brought before
a court, it would be a hard case
for the government to win. The

730
01:14:13,667 --> 01:14:20,333
threat of it out there may
discourage people. But this is a
1918 law that was passed during

731
01:14:20,333 --> 01:14:26,333
World War I. It's fairly a
draconian. And it hasn't really
been used. But it's threat is

732
01:14:28,417 --> 01:14:34,125
there. I'm hopeful if it ever
does get through, they'll pull
the trigger on that. And that

733
01:14:34,125 --> 01:14:39,083
ourselves or someone else whose
fighting on that case, can
establish that that is above the

734
01:14:39,083 --> 01:14:44,208
law and take that threat away.
>> Thank you. >> The other -- so
there's another side to this of

735
01:14:44,208 --> 01:14:49,625
course which is there are
technical protection measures
that whistle blowers can use to

736
01:14:49,625 --> 01:14:54,625
protect themselves. The one that
I'm going to plug is secure
drop. Secure drop is maintained

737
01:14:54,625 --> 01:15:00,542
by the freedom of the press
foundation which is a friend and
client of the Electronic

738
01:15:00,542 --> 01:15:07,625
Frontier Foundation. And allows
what we think is probably a
secure way for whistle blowers

739
01:15:07,625 --> 01:15:17,500
to talk to journalists in a way
that they will not be able to be
identify later. So yay, secure

740
01:15:17,500 --> 01:15:23,500
drop. >> So I actually work on
secure drop and have since the
last major re-release of it. So

741
01:15:29,250 --> 01:15:34,875
secure drop is based on a Tor
Browser window currently. So all
the caveats of browser attack

742
01:15:34,875 --> 01:15:39,875
surface, all the caveats of
attacks against Tor -- services
and so forth, apply to secure

743
01:15:39,875 --> 01:15:46,750
drop. So make of that what you
will. But there are people who
are, there are more people now

744
01:15:46,750 --> 01:15:50,708
thinking about how to protect
whistle blowers internalists
because they realize this is a

745
01:15:50,708 --> 01:15:55,125
really important problem. We
heard of this thing called
invisible.IM that some people

746
01:15:55,125 --> 01:16:02,542
just came up with. So yeah,
there is more technology out
there. But, you know, like given

747
01:16:02,542 --> 01:16:08,667
an adversary like the NSA, you
have to be really careful about
the claims you make about

748
01:16:08,667 --> 01:16:14,708
security. >> You mentioned
earlier about community wi-fi.
My question in regards to that

749
01:16:14,708 --> 01:16:21,000
is how does community wi-fi and
municipal fiber affect net
neutrality. And how can one like

750
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:26,583
myself combat the vast amounts
of misinformation surrounding
those subjects. >> Little hard

751
01:16:26,583 --> 01:16:30,500
for me to hear you. You're
asking about municipal wi-fi.
>> Yeah community wi-fi and

752
01:16:30,500 --> 01:16:34,667
municipal fiber and how do they
effect net neutrality and what
can I do to combat the

753
01:16:34,667 --> 01:16:40,667
misinformation or any of us do?
>> So on municipal wi-fi, we
have an open wireless project

754
01:16:44,250 --> 01:16:50,542
that we are promoting. Part of
it is actually, here we have
recently released some software

755
01:16:50,542 --> 01:16:58,083
for router based on open WRT.
We're trying to make it both
more secure and also have it

756
01:16:58,083 --> 01:17:05,042
easier to have a segregated
guest network, so people could
open their wireless and help --

757
01:17:05,042 --> 01:17:09,333
basically be a good neighbor and
allow people to get on the
internet through their

758
01:17:09,333 --> 01:17:17,042
connection while not
compromising ourselves. Another
aspect of this is -- in order --

759
01:17:17,042 --> 01:17:21,583
municipalities are either making
unity wi-fi where they're
harboring free wi-fi for all the

760
01:17:21,583 --> 01:17:26,042
citizens of their community, or
in some cases they'll have
municipal fiber which they will

761
01:17:26,042 --> 01:17:32,042
make available to people who
want to use it. So it's like,
let a thousand flowers bloom

762
01:17:32,042 --> 01:17:38,042
using this municipal wi-fi. And
this means that people will have
alternative ways of getting on

763
01:17:41,167 --> 01:17:47,875
to the internet where they can
just go through their city or
through a neighbor who's running

764
01:17:47,875 --> 01:17:53,875
open wireless. Then this can
help bring them out -- you don't
have to go through a major

765
01:17:56,042 --> 01:18:02,250
provider who have been talking a
lot about being un-neutral and
throttling different types of --

766
01:18:02,250 --> 01:18:08,292
or making a fast lane depending
on how you look at it for
various types of access to web

767
01:18:08,292 --> 01:18:14,000
sites. So by providing an
alternative path for people to
get on the web, that maybe

768
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:21,333
helpful in making sure that
folks can get to the stuff they
want to see without having to go

769
01:18:21,333 --> 01:18:28,250
through a major ISP. >> Thanks.
>> I know we briefly talked
about gag orders, I was curious

770
01:18:28,250 --> 01:18:33,708
to get your opinion on warrent
Canaries. That being a canary
that dies in the mine to say

771
01:18:33,708 --> 01:18:40,208
that it's now unsafe to be
there. Along the lines of, you
know, Google or someone hosting

772
01:18:40,208 --> 01:18:46,667
a page that they update manually
every week or so saying no we
haven't received a warrant or a

773
01:18:46,667 --> 01:18:52,042
gag order. And then you know,
can the government actually tell
them to not take this down and

774
01:18:52,042 --> 01:18:58,042
to lie to -- with hold this gag
order. >> So warrant canaries
are fascinating. And I actually

775
01:19:01,250 --> 01:19:05,917
wrote a FAQ about warrant
canaries so you can look at that
on our blog for a really deep

776
01:19:05,917 --> 01:19:10,750
drill down. Sort of go over
briefly, that this has not been
litigated, we don't have a court

777
01:19:10,750 --> 01:19:16,333
that has said one way or the
other about how it would work
with warrant canaries -- and you

778
01:19:16,333 --> 01:19:20,250
were exactly right about what
the issues and things
--compelled speech. Courts have

779
01:19:20,250 --> 01:19:25,208
dealt with compelled speech
before. And in a few instances,
you can compel someone to speak,

780
01:19:25,208 --> 01:19:32,208
like warning labels are a form
of compelled speech. So that's
why they, the cigarette

781
01:19:32,208 --> 01:19:35,583
companies don't want to have
warnings on their packs. But
nevertheless, they're compelled

782
01:19:35,583 --> 01:19:41,417
to do so. Most compelled speech
circumstances have been in
commercial speech. And a warrant

783
01:19:41,417 --> 01:19:46,667
canary would be a circumstance
where it is put there for
political reasons. And by and

784
01:19:46,667 --> 01:19:51,875
large when it is compelled
political speech, courts have
not been friendly to us. I think

785
01:19:51,875 --> 01:19:58,000
there's some pretty good
argument that the government
shouldn't be able to compel you

786
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:04,167
to lie. Never the less, these
haven't been tested. And one of
the things that we'll see if one

787
01:20:04,167 --> 01:20:10,500
of these cases come up, please
do get in touch with us. Because
we'll be very interested in that

788
01:20:10,500 --> 01:20:17,375
type of case. Ideally it would
be a circumstance in which the
canary, the event will not occur

789
01:20:17,375 --> 01:20:22,917
for some time so that we can
have a full briefing schedule
with the court. And the court

790
01:20:22,917 --> 01:20:27,875
can look at it in a calm and
measured manner which is sort of
-- courts if they're going to do

791
01:20:27,875 --> 01:20:33,833
something bold and radical, they
need to do it in a calm and
measured way. So if you know

792
01:20:33,833 --> 01:20:38,000
this is going to go live
tomorrow and the government is
saying there'll be blood on your

793
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:44,875
hands, we have a giant emergency
here, most likely the court is
going to say okay, I'm not -- I

794
01:20:44,875 --> 01:20:49,458
don't understand this well
enough to do something bold and
to disagree with the government

795
01:20:49,458 --> 01:20:55,458
who's telling me the world will
end. But if we're able to go
through it and explain these --

796
01:20:59,792 --> 01:21:04,667
write a good brief that explains
the compelled speech law and how
it applies here, we're hopful

797
01:21:04,667 --> 01:21:10,667
for the best. >> Hi, thank you
for your work first of all. My
question is regarding the topic

798
01:21:10,667 --> 01:21:16,667
of privacy and identities. And I
wanted to get -- >> Privacy and?
>> Identity, online identities.

799
01:21:18,792 --> 01:21:25,333
>> Online events. >> Identities.
Just want to get your opinion on
government programs that deal

800
01:21:25,333 --> 01:21:31,333
with these issues such as the
national strategy for trust
identities in cyber space nstic?

801
01:21:33,375 --> 01:21:38,458
>> Can you repeat the last half
of the question? >> Which -- is
this better? >> Yes. Much

802
01:21:38,458 --> 01:21:44,333
better. >> Sorry. First time on
a mic. Your opinion on programs
that deal with trusted

803
01:21:44,333 --> 01:21:50,333
identities in cyber space such
as nstic, which I just use the
acronym. >> It suggests what?

804
01:21:53,375 --> 01:21:58,958
>> nstic national strategy for
trusted identities in cyber
space. I just wanted to get your

805
01:21:58,958 --> 01:22:03,917
opinion on programs like that.
>> I know that some of my
colleagues have been looking

806
01:22:03,917 --> 01:22:10,833
into that. But I don't know if
anyone is on this panel. Lee was
looking into that. >> Lee Chin

807
01:22:10,833 --> 01:22:16,750
will be able to answer your
question another time. >> He's
really great. So he's probably

808
01:22:16,750 --> 01:22:23,458
doing wonderful things about it,
but I just don't happen to know
what they are. >> Hi, so, it's

809
01:22:23,458 --> 01:22:29,208
been an interesting year already
for supreme court cases. You've
already talked about a couple of

810
01:22:29,208 --> 01:22:35,083
them. There was also the one
having to do with retransmission
of over the air television

811
01:22:35,083 --> 01:22:41,208
broadcasts. >> Aereo. >> Aereo,
yeah. >> Yeah, I was wondering
if you could comment on that and

812
01:22:41,208 --> 01:22:46,875
if you could comment on any
upcoming Supreme Court cases
that you're involved with or

813
01:22:46,875 --> 01:22:52,875
tracking. >> I'll answer the
Aereo question. So Aereo, as
many of you may know was a

814
01:22:55,792 --> 01:23:02,750
company that was selling a
service where you could
basically have an antenna --

815
01:23:02,750 --> 01:23:07,500
individual antenna, so they have
thousands of these dimed sized
antenna. Each customer would

816
01:23:07,500 --> 01:23:13,542
have one. It would get broadcast
from initially New York and
eventually some other areas. And

817
01:23:13,542 --> 01:23:18,667
for residents of those areas,
they could watch over the
internet, a stream that was

818
01:23:18,667 --> 01:23:25,625
generated from that antenna. And
we looked at that case, and
looked at the law, and it really

819
01:23:25,625 --> 01:23:32,125
seemed like that was a
circumstance in which they were
not doing a public performance

820
01:23:32,125 --> 01:23:37,083
of the copyright act. They were
doing something that was
basically an extended antenna,

821
01:23:37,083 --> 01:23:44,625
it was an innovative way of
doing something. That was not
prohibited by the copyright act

822
01:23:44,625 --> 01:23:50,792
under the language of the act as
drafted. And so we wrote an
Amicus brief in that case and

823
01:23:50,792 --> 01:23:54,917
tried to explain to the court
that some people were saying
basically, this is taking

824
01:23:54,917 --> 01:23:59,792
advantage of a loophole, this is
not what we want to have here
and then it's not the court's

825
01:23:59,792 --> 01:24:05,125
place to make these sorts of
decisions. So in order to
preserve innovation, people have

826
01:24:05,125 --> 01:24:09,917
to innovate within the law that
exists. As I look at the law
that exists, they find that

827
01:24:09,917 --> 01:24:14,667
there is an area where the
copyright act is not prohibiting
it they should be able to do

828
01:24:14,667 --> 01:24:20,500
that unless congress comes in
and changes the law to make
those changes. But nevertheless,

829
01:24:20,500 --> 01:24:26,167
unfortunately, the Supreme Court
that did come out against
Aereo's business model, they

830
01:24:26,167 --> 01:24:32,500
said they were kind of more or
less like a cable company and so
therefore they should be treated

831
01:24:32,500 --> 01:24:39,625
like a cable company and well,
Aereo ended up losing on that
argument. >> Do you think that

832
01:24:39,625 --> 01:24:47,583
has any other implications for
other companies outside of that
decision? >> So the court in

833
01:24:47,583 --> 01:24:52,917
writing this decision took some
pains to say we are not doing
anything that's going to be bad

834
01:24:52,917 --> 01:24:57,417
for the cloud. They were very
worried about the effect of this
case on the cloud. The word

835
01:24:57,417 --> 01:25:03,417
cloud came up a lot. In our
argument there. And so I hope
that when other judges are

836
01:25:08,417 --> 01:25:15,583
looking at this decision and
they have the content industry
saying this decision means that

837
01:25:15,583 --> 01:25:20,750
something else that is
innovative is also bad. That
those courts will look at that

838
01:25:20,750 --> 01:25:26,167
language that limiting language
and say okay, we should limit
this really to these specific

839
01:25:26,167 --> 01:25:30,958
facts. But certainly the
reporting industry is going to
try and expand it as best they

840
01:25:30,958 --> 01:25:36,750
can. And so, we're going to try
to limit it as best we can.
>> Thank you very much. >> If

841
01:25:36,750 --> 01:25:43,750
you want a little piece of legal
decree, our colleague Parker
Higgens did a cut of all of the

842
01:25:43,750 --> 01:25:49,083
uses of the word cloud in that
oral argument. And he put it on
sound cloud. So if you Google

843
01:25:49,083 --> 01:25:55,083
Parker Higgens supreme court
cloud, it's masterful. >> Have
you or any of your associates

844
01:25:59,083 --> 01:26:04,708
suffered any of the theoretical
consequences of your
affiliations be it increased

845
01:26:04,708 --> 01:26:10,750
surveillance, selective
prosecution or anything that
would be considered heat. And if

846
01:26:10,750 --> 01:26:16,333
not, do you at least feel like
you're walking on egg shells.
Harvey Silverglate's book talks

847
01:26:16,333 --> 01:26:24,042
about the average American
breaking three federal laws a
day. Umm, I guess that wouldn't

848
01:26:24,042 --> 01:26:30,167
really be an option for you guys
I would think. And also, I'm not
limiting the scope to just

849
01:26:30,167 --> 01:26:37,708
governmental type heat, but any
organizations that would
consider you adversarial? >> So

850
01:26:37,708 --> 01:26:43,708
-- to add to this, I feel like
we are within three hops of
people that they're interested

851
01:26:46,125 --> 01:26:52,083
in. So under the terms of the
program that probably means they
are looking at our phone records

852
01:26:52,083 --> 01:26:58,500
and such. But we're all under
surveillance under the program.
Whether it has been directed

853
01:26:58,500 --> 01:27:06,458
heat. I don't think any of us
have been selectively
prosecuted. And you know, I

854
01:27:06,458 --> 01:27:13,250
would hope that even if they are
looking deeply at us, that's --
I would think that if they

855
01:27:13,250 --> 01:27:19,542
actually decided to do something
discriminatory, that they
realize that'd be a bit of news

856
01:27:19,542 --> 01:27:25,167
and that they wouldn't want to
create martyrs. But I guess
we'll find out if they do.

857
01:27:25,167 --> 01:27:30,583
>> For the U.S. government
detaining employees of the
electronic frontier foundation

858
01:27:30,583 --> 01:27:38,125
is incredibly media pathic. That
provides us with a tiny bit of
protection. My threat model on

859
01:27:38,125 --> 01:27:42,167
the other hand, because I do
international work and I spend a
lot of time working with

860
01:27:42,167 --> 01:27:48,292
journalists and activists who
are under threat in other
countries, my threat model is

861
01:27:48,292 --> 01:27:54,792
mostly non U.S. government. And
probably the funniest sort of
heat that I have ever seen come

862
01:27:54,792 --> 01:28:00,792
my way was the time that the
Vietnamese government sent me
malware. [Laughing] >> I do all

863
01:28:05,250 --> 01:28:08,417
of EFF's malware analysis
reports. [Laughing] >> Free
advertisement. >> So they

864
01:28:08,417 --> 01:28:14,417
couldn't have sent it to a more
appropriate person. If it had
come to somewhere else, our

865
01:28:17,958 --> 01:28:24,417
intake coordinator would have
just wound up sending it to me.
So I got together with Morgan

866
01:28:24,417 --> 01:28:30,000
Marquis-Boire from citizen lab
and we wrote up the contents of
the malware, but what was

867
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:33,000
particularly interesting about
this malware, besides the fact
that it would not have worked on

868
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:39,000
my machine in the first place,
was the targeting. The malware
was made to look like an e-mail

869
01:28:41,333 --> 01:28:47,333
from a gentleman at oxfam
offering me an invitation to a
conference in Asia. This showed

870
01:28:49,750 --> 01:28:55,750
a tremendous understanding of
what interests activists. Which
is free conferences. [Laughing]

871
01:28:58,375 --> 01:29:02,417
>> If they had really wanted me
to open the document, they
should have offered free flights

872
01:29:02,417 --> 01:29:07,958
and hotels. [Laughing] >>
Business class travel would have
done it I think. >> Oh man, I

873
01:29:07,958 --> 01:29:12,917
would have been owned. >> I
wanted to add to what Curt said
about canaries and say that the

874
01:29:12,917 --> 01:29:16,792
courts are much more liberal
when it comes to restraining
action. >> Can you get closer to

875
01:29:16,792 --> 01:29:21,000
the mic. >> Sorry, I was going
to add to what you were saying
about canaries. That the courts

876
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:26,042
tend to be much more liberal
about restraining action then
compelling it. So if the canary

877
01:29:26,042 --> 01:29:32,833
is automated or already up, they
can restrain you from modifying
it much more willing to do that

878
01:29:32,833 --> 01:29:38,333
than it would be to compel you
to continue to take a manual
action. But my question really

879
01:29:38,333 --> 01:29:43,042
goes to what you said earlier
about infrared cameras peeking
inside home using heat

880
01:29:43,042 --> 01:29:48,750
sensitivity. And it goes to
technology and the reasonable
expectation of privacy. And the

881
01:29:48,750 --> 01:29:56,042
question is, does encryption
create a reasonable expectation
of privacy? Particularly

882
01:29:56,042 --> 01:30:02,000
vis-a-vis Smith V Maryland?
>> So talking about Smith V
Maryland. For those who are not

883
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:08,208
familiar with it. That is the
origin case of the third party
doctrine this notion, that if

884
01:30:08,208 --> 01:30:14,625
you put your information online
that you are no longer having an
expectation of privacy in it. So

885
01:30:14,625 --> 01:30:20,458
it's open season on that
information which is one of the
things that we're trying to

886
01:30:20,458 --> 01:30:26,458
undercut that doctorate and make
it make sense in a modern age.
On encryption, one of the areas

887
01:30:29,667 --> 01:30:35,667
where this has come up has been
on forced decryption. There's a
little bit of a different

888
01:30:38,750 --> 01:30:43,792
question. Because if your
encryption is good. Then the
question of whether you have a

889
01:30:43,792 --> 01:30:50,333
reasonable expectation of
privacy isn't going to come up
so much as, can they get at it.

890
01:30:50,333 --> 01:30:56,333
And they'll need to get a
password and the question is can
they require you to give up that

891
01:30:58,458 --> 01:31:04,458
password? So it usually comes up
in a 5th amendment context.
>> Or a key. >> Or a key. >> So

892
01:31:08,125 --> 01:31:15,917
umm, while you do have a fifth
amendment right, to not give up
your password. Sometimes this

893
01:31:15,917 --> 01:31:22,958
could be undercut by the
inevitable disclosure doctrine.
So what this means is that if

894
01:31:22,958 --> 01:31:28,875
they are able to convince the
court that that information
would have come up any way

895
01:31:28,875 --> 01:31:35,583
because they know what's in
there, then they could require
you to decrypt it. They can't

896
01:31:35,583 --> 01:31:41,167
tell you to give up your
password. They will require you
to decrypt the information,

897
01:31:41,167 --> 01:31:48,750
which is the same. But if
decrypting the information would
show that this is your

898
01:31:48,750 --> 01:31:53,167
information, it would be a
testimonial act, it would give
them new data that you actually

899
01:31:53,167 --> 01:31:58,667
had control over this, then that
starts to be more strongly
protected by the fifth

900
01:31:58,667 --> 01:32:04,958
amendment. There have only been
a handful of cases on this so
while we're going to continue to

901
01:32:04,958 --> 01:32:12,333
work on those fights and push
against forced decryption. And
we really have not had one which

902
01:32:12,333 --> 01:32:18,083
has put decryption or encryption
into, directly in the third
party doctrine. So we'll look

903
01:32:18,083 --> 01:32:21,375
forward for when that case comes
up before the courts. >> I think
an important -- another

904
01:32:21,375 --> 01:32:26,542
important point here though is
-- I would argue very strongly
and I have, that you have a

905
01:32:26,542 --> 01:32:32,667
reasonable expectation of
privacy in your communications
even if they're not encrypted.

906
01:32:32,667 --> 01:32:38,667
>> Absolutely the fact that's a
case that we were successful
with in the sixth circuit where

907
01:32:40,667 --> 01:32:46,125
the court found that there was a
reasonable expectation of
privacy in e-mail, even if it

908
01:32:46,125 --> 01:32:51,292
wasn't encrypted regardless of
whether it was encrypted and
required a warrant to get that

909
01:32:51,292 --> 01:32:56,417
e-mail. And one of the things we
did with the who has your back
report, that they were talking

910
01:32:56,417 --> 01:33:01,292
about earlier, is we asked all
these service providers, do they
insist upon a warrant before

911
01:33:01,292 --> 01:33:05,917
they give up content. And you
can look at that report and see
where the gold stars are. We're

912
01:33:05,917 --> 01:33:10,958
basically asking them to say
that they agreed with that six
circuit decision and would apply

913
01:33:10,958 --> 01:33:17,375
it regardless of what circuit
they were in. >> I was concerned
that my question may have

914
01:33:17,375 --> 01:33:21,750
actually just been pulled out
from under me by the previous
questioner. But it looks like it

915
01:33:21,750 --> 01:33:26,875
veered in a different direction.
So, my question was, can you
speak to third party doctrine in

916
01:33:26,875 --> 01:33:32,583
the context of data that is
encrypted before leaving your
system and being stored in

917
01:33:32,583 --> 01:33:38,458
cloud. In other words, true
crypt file stored on drop box.
That sort of thing. Without

918
01:33:38,458 --> 01:33:44,708
veering into the fifth amendment
side of it which I know is a
separate discussion. By doing

919
01:33:44,708 --> 01:33:50,208
those two actions together, are
you automatically going to fall
under third party doctrine, even

920
01:33:50,208 --> 01:33:56,625
though the data was encrypted
before it left your system? >> I
guess you echo a little bit of

921
01:33:56,625 --> 01:34:03,375
what Nate was just saying. What
we've been pushing for is to
require warrants before you get

922
01:34:03,375 --> 01:34:07,917
that information regardless of
whether it's encrypted. That
this notion that you've given up

923
01:34:07,917 --> 01:34:13,708
your privacy rights by taking
advantage of online services
where you're storing your

924
01:34:13,708 --> 01:34:19,500
information elsewhere is an
antiquated and out dated notion.
You should be able to take full

925
01:34:19,500 --> 01:34:25,500
advantage of modern technologies
without giving up your civil
liberties. So. [Applause] >> Now

926
01:34:28,958 --> 01:34:35,500
you can add to that by giving
yourself some technical
protection. By using encryption

927
01:34:35,500 --> 01:34:42,083
both in the communication and
storing it there. And this can
be helpful to add an extra layer

928
01:34:42,083 --> 01:34:47,750
of technical protection against
that principle. And to -- what
gives me a lot of hope on this

929
01:34:47,750 --> 01:34:53,250
front is the Riley decision. The
Riley decision we talked about
earlier, this was the cell phone

930
01:34:53,250 --> 01:34:56,417
decision. And one of the things
they talked about was why you
needed a warrant there was in

931
01:34:56,417 --> 01:35:04,167
part because if you got onto
somebody's phone you might be
able to access information they

932
01:35:04,167 --> 01:35:10,750
held elsewhere. And if you think
about that, if they believed
that the third party doctrine

933
01:35:10,750 --> 01:35:15,917
made all of that pointless, you
didn't a warrant, once you put
it on the server, it doesn't

934
01:35:15,917 --> 01:35:20,792
matter there's no need to say
that in the opinion. It's
suggested that when they were

935
01:35:20,792 --> 01:35:24,958
looking at the phone, looking at
the capabilities of the phone to
be able to get that information

936
01:35:24,958 --> 01:35:31,000
off of a drop box or wherever,
that this was something that
brought a warrant to their mind.

937
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:37,208
So hopefully we will get a good
case on this. More good cases to
establish that a warrant is

938
01:35:37,208 --> 01:35:41,625
needed for any of this
information whether it's
encrypted or not. But sure, you

939
01:35:41,625 --> 01:35:46,708
might as well also add that
extra layer of protection by
putting encryption on any

940
01:35:46,708 --> 01:35:53,125
materials your storing
elsewhere. >> Thanks for
everything. >> The files that

941
01:35:53,125 --> 01:35:59,125
allowed for the 3D printing of
firearms were taken down, can
you discuss the law around that.

942
01:36:02,042 --> 01:36:08,208
>> The question was about the 3D
printer and the firearms. I
don't know if anybody on this

943
01:36:08,208 --> 01:36:14,208
panel has worked on that. >>
That case is in progress. That's
the best answer I can give. >>

944
01:36:17,250 --> 01:36:23,250
I'm curious about if in your
international work you've run
into situations where a foreign

945
01:36:23,250 --> 01:36:29,250
government is using the U.S.
court to suppress free speech
from bloggers and online

946
01:36:33,083 --> 01:36:40,583
newspapers from dissidents from
their government. There's a
recent pattern recently, the

947
01:36:40,583 --> 01:36:48,542
Haitian government has been
using defamation laws in the
U.S. to silence, by opening

948
01:36:48,542 --> 01:36:55,417
multiple lawsuits against
bloggers and online newspapers.
I'm wondering if you've

949
01:36:55,417 --> 01:37:01,083
encountered that strategy from
other governments or -- and is
that something that you guys

950
01:37:01,083 --> 01:37:07,958
would be interested in looking
into? >> Well it turns out that
there's an incredible variety of

951
01:37:07,958 --> 01:37:14,875
tactics that governments use to
silence speech all over the
world. Especially speech which

952
01:37:14,875 --> 01:37:22,708
is taking part on platforms that
they do not directly control. So
third party platforms like

953
01:37:22,708 --> 01:37:28,708
Facebook and Twitter and Tumbler
and Blogger are tremendously
dangerous to governments that

954
01:37:33,167 --> 01:37:39,167
want to maintain strict control
over their media. And frequently
these platforms become one place

955
01:37:42,542 --> 01:37:48,375
where you can get independent
media in certain countries.
Probably the best example of

956
01:37:48,375 --> 01:37:53,875
that that I can think of off the
top of my head is Ethiopia.
Because I spent a lot of time

957
01:37:53,875 --> 01:37:58,667
working with Ethiopian
activists. We've seen a couple
of different tactics for

958
01:37:58,667 --> 01:38:05,792
shutting down speech. Probably
the most common one that
involves the U.S. law is to

959
01:38:05,792 --> 01:38:12,250
simply file DMCA takedowns
against speech the government
doesn't like. And this is a very

960
01:38:12,250 --> 01:38:19,000
common abuse of the DMCA. This
is sort of the basis of one of
our main protests against the

961
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:25,000
DMCA. Because the way the DMCA
works is that a person who is
complaining can actually get

962
01:38:28,958 --> 01:38:36,375
content taken down merely by
alleging that the content is
theirs. And that it is an abuse

963
01:38:36,375 --> 01:38:42,958
of their copyright. And it is up
to the person who has put the
content up in the first place to

964
01:38:42,958 --> 01:38:48,875
file a counter notice if they
want the content to be put back
up. And in doing so, they both

965
01:38:48,875 --> 01:38:54,708
have to reveal information about
themselves and also open
themselves up to the possibility

966
01:38:54,708 --> 01:39:01,333
of a lawsuit. And so often they
are -- even if they know they
can do this, they're scared to

967
01:39:01,333 --> 01:39:06,958
do so. Sometimes the content is
also time sensitive. So by the
time they have filed the counter

968
01:39:06,958 --> 01:39:13,875
notice and put the content back
up, it's already too late. We've
seen this approach. We have also

969
01:39:13,875 --> 01:39:21,292
seen the abuses of the abuse
reporting system. For example, I
worked with activists at Viet

970
01:39:21,292 --> 01:39:28,333
Tan which is sort of
prodemocracy opposition group
mostly located in Vietnam that

971
01:39:28,333 --> 01:39:34,167
was having a bunch of their
Facebook sites taken down. So
many members of the Viet Tan

972
01:39:34,167 --> 01:39:38,792
were losing access to their
Facebook accounts. And this is
where they were doing most of

973
01:39:38,792 --> 01:39:43,958
their activism. And it turned
out that supporters of the
Vietnamese government had

974
01:39:43,958 --> 01:39:49,375
figured out that one way you can
shut down somebody's Facebook
account very quickly is simply

975
01:39:49,375 --> 01:39:55,458
by reporting that the user is
underage. This is another abuse
of the abuse system rather than

976
01:39:55,458 --> 01:40:01,458
abuse of the court system. And
one of the things that EFF finds
extremely worrying is that these

977
01:40:04,458 --> 01:40:10,375
third party platforms like
Facebook and Tumbler and Twitter
have become sort of the

978
01:40:10,375 --> 01:40:16,375
semipublic comments. And umm,
often you don't have to go
through the courts anymore and

979
01:40:16,375 --> 01:40:22,583
you don't have to go through any
kind of legal rig ma role if you
want to suppress speech. All you

980
01:40:22,583 --> 01:40:28,583
need to do is gain the system
that these platforms put up in
order to decide what content

981
01:40:31,042 --> 01:40:37,042
stays up and what stays down.
And in order to sort of fight
this, EFF has just received a

982
01:40:37,042 --> 01:40:43,500
grant from the night foundation
to run a site that we're calling
onlinesensorship.org. I think

983
01:40:43,500 --> 01:40:49,042
the first version of it is
already up. It's a place where
people can report things that

984
01:40:49,042 --> 01:40:55,042
have been taken down from -- on
these sites usually for TOS
violations and this gives us

985
01:41:02,750 --> 01:41:08,750
some insight into how these
services are taking content down
and whether or not there is bias

986
01:41:11,542 --> 01:41:15,250
in the kind of content their
taking down and whether or not
there are campaigns to get

987
01:41:15,250 --> 01:41:18,750
certain kinds of content taken
down. Which is something that we
really don't know anything about

988
01:41:18,750 --> 01:41:22,667
right now. >> Thank you. >> We
only have a couple minutes left
for questions. Only about two

989
01:41:22,667 --> 01:41:26,167
minutes left for questions.
>> Two minutes? We'll take these
last two questions. >> Jump into

990
01:41:26,167 --> 01:41:32,875
it. As we use technology more in
our civilization and I assume
technology related questions

991
01:41:32,875 --> 01:41:38,292
like the DMCA and -- maybe a
keylogger in Divorce or
something, those are all

992
01:41:38,292 --> 01:41:43,333
penetrating the courts across
the country and just boring non-
precedence setting cases. And I

993
01:41:43,333 --> 01:41:49,500
wondered if you guys had any
insight into how much or how
often these technology issues

994
01:41:49,500 --> 01:41:55,958
are coming up just in random
cases that don't make the news
and if you think our courts and

995
01:41:55,958 --> 01:42:02,625
the random lawyers across the
country are up to it. What's the
situation with all that? >> We

996
01:42:02,625 --> 01:42:10,458
get a little bit of insight into
that because our intake system
receives a lot of requests where

997
01:42:10,458 --> 01:42:15,542
they may not be precedence
setting that we end up referring
them to other people. But at

998
01:42:15,542 --> 01:42:20,375
least it gives us a sense of
what's out there, we try to
refer people to qualified

999
01:42:20,375 --> 01:42:25,208
council so they can fight those
issues. There's probably a lot
more people out there who don't

1000
01:42:25,208 --> 01:42:30,500
know about the EFF who might be
in the situation that don't know
to contact us. So, if you hear

1001
01:42:30,500 --> 01:42:35,292
about people who are in a
situation where they should
contact us. Pass down the good

1002
01:42:35,292 --> 01:42:42,667
word. But yeah, I think the
technology is coming into many
many cases. A number of years

1003
01:42:42,667 --> 01:42:48,667
ago it was -- it would go to the
courts for the subpoena to try
to identify an online speaker.

1004
01:42:51,875 --> 01:42:59,000
And we were called to a lot of
litigation around that to try to
establish what the test is for

1005
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:04,583
revealing the identity of an
online speaker. Now we will
occasionally get involved in

1006
01:43:04,583 --> 01:43:09,500
those cases where it's going to
be a chance to approve that test
or find that test in a new

1007
01:43:09,500 --> 01:43:15,083
jurisdiction. But in many many
cases all across the country,
people are using that and

1008
01:43:15,083 --> 01:43:20,917
applying those tests to either
identify or not identify
somebody. >> Cool, alright, last

1009
01:43:20,917 --> 01:43:26,917
question. >> So if people want
to use software, they have to
click something that says yes I

1010
01:43:30,167 --> 01:43:35,333
have read this document and I
have agree to the all the terms
so although people technically

1011
01:43:35,333 --> 01:43:41,750
have agreed to it, they probably
aren't aware that every single
thing they type into the address

1012
01:43:41,750 --> 01:43:47,667
bar of chrome is going back to
Google and they probably haven't
begun to think about how nest is

1013
01:43:47,667 --> 01:43:53,458
going to affect what Google now
knows about them. You guys have
the who has your back report for

1014
01:43:53,458 --> 01:43:59,875
encryption. Are any plans to put
up a similar report for who
isn't asking you to give out

1015
01:43:59,875 --> 01:44:06,083
copious amounts of your privacy
or calling out the ones who do?
>> That's a good question. We

1016
01:44:06,083 --> 01:44:13,375
don't have any plans to do that
right now. We are pretty slammed
bandwidth wise. But it's great.

1017
01:44:13,375 --> 01:44:21,125
You should do it. [Laughing]
[Applause] >> Alright, thanks.
>> Thank you. Thank you all for

1018
01:44:21,125 --> 01:44:28,250
coming and thank you so much.
The support from this community
has always been very important

1019
01:44:28,250 --> 01:44:35,042
to us, we love you all. It's so
great to be here once again to
answer your questions. So thank

1020
01:44:35,042 --> 01:44:39,833
you guys. [Applause]
