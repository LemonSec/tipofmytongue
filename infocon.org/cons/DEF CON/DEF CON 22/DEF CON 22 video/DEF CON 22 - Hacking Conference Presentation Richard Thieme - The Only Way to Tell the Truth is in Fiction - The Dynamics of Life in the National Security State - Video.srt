1
00:00:00,167 --> 00:00:05,792
It's my distinct pleasure to
introduce Richard Thieme. He's
been giving talks here at DEF

2
00:00:05,792 --> 00:00:12,875
CON for 19 years. That's
absolutely incredible. I don't
want to embarrass him and tell

3
00:00:12,875 --> 00:00:18,875
him what I was doing 19 years
ago. Whenever I go home,
certainly being on the old team

4
00:00:22,042 --> 00:00:26,708
I was on, I usually missed most
of the talks. I always take time
to go back and listen to

5
00:00:26,708 --> 00:00:32,500
Richard's talks, and this is
going to be great. He was a
guest on coast to coast A.M.

6
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:39,000
which I've listened to since I
was a kid. It is my distinct
pleasure to introduce Richard

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Thieme. >> Thank you. It really
has 19 years. As someone tweeted
like a deranged old man, and

8
00:00:53,708 --> 00:00:59,708
that was three years ago. So you
accept your destiny. Josh Corman
was a Calvary man. He said I

9
00:01:02,542 --> 00:01:08,542
want to talk to you and pick
your brains while we still have
you. People used to not say

10
00:01:10,875 --> 00:01:16,875
that. So you have to do to deal
with how you're perceived, and
you say I have to tell the whole

11
00:01:20,583 --> 00:01:26,583
truth as I know it and see it
for what it's worth. You have
one brief span to hold that

12
00:01:28,667 --> 00:01:33,208
bright, shining torch, and
instead of whining and
complaining that the world won't

13
00:01:33,208 --> 00:01:38,375
dedicate itself to make you
happy, you want it to blaze as
brightly as possible, and you

14
00:01:38,375 --> 00:01:44,458
want at the end of your life to
be all used up because you have
expended all the energy you have

15
00:01:44,458 --> 00:01:50,583
got. In doing that, in trying to
be of value and people that you
come to love, which includes

16
00:01:50,583 --> 00:01:56,583
this weird collection of people
here at DEFCON. So let's get
going. The only way to tell the

17
00:01:59,875 --> 00:02:05,875
truth is through fiction. Where
did that come from? Let's see if
we can get this to work. No.

18
00:02:08,167 --> 00:02:15,667
Keeps doing the same thing. It
is no wonder how complicated
things get with one thing

19
00:02:15,667 --> 00:02:21,667
leading to another said E.B.
White, and he wasn't kidding.
When you set off on a journey to

20
00:02:26,167 --> 00:02:31,083
find out what is real, you walk
on one side of the strip, and
you're convinced there's another

21
00:02:31,083 --> 00:02:36,750
side of the strip. As you come
around you know how the strip
works. You find yourself always

22
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:42,375
on the same side. My intention
is to describe here is what the
world since World War II has

23
00:02:42,375 --> 00:02:48,375
become. If you were born during
or before World War II, and my
hand was the only one that went

24
00:02:50,833 --> 00:02:58,500
up. In this room there are
probably a few more, but not
many of you might know in a

25
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:05,667
noncontextual way how we have
come to live and accept reality
for what it - is different than

26
00:03:05,667 --> 00:03:11,667
it was before the Cold War,
which created post‑modernization
and deconstructionism to

27
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:23,292
understand what's going on. I
know we love to say the matrix,
but the deeper you go after

28
00:03:23,292 --> 00:03:29,292
taking the red pill, the more
lavender it becomes, and you
have a red and purple pill all

29
00:03:31,542 --> 00:03:36,292
the way down. We can never get
to the bottom of it, because the
movie strip brings us to back to

30
00:03:36,292 --> 00:03:42,292
where we began. I'll describe
the conditions as I see them,
and hope you will not as some

31
00:03:44,875 --> 00:03:50,208
people do when I do the talk on
UFOs and government how the
government responded to UFO

32
00:03:50,208 --> 00:03:53,958
phenomena for 60 years by saying
I don't want to know that.
That's an essential bubble in

33
00:03:53,958 --> 00:03:56,708
which people live their lives by
choice because the cognitive
dissonance in knowing what is

34
00:03:56,708 --> 00:04:02,708
real in our society and nation
is too painful, too discordant.
Remember what Nietchze said a

35
00:04:15,792 --> 00:04:21,750
long time ago. When one is
confronted with the unknown, the
first instinct is to abolish the

36
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:27,750
discomfort and pain. Any
explanation is better than none,
because you want to get your

37
00:04:30,792 --> 00:04:37,375
head rid of oppressive
representations. One is not
particular about how you to get

38
00:04:37,375 --> 00:04:43,375
rid of them. The first one that
explains them is the one people
grab ahold of. The proof of

39
00:04:46,292 --> 00:04:52,875
pleasure is a criterion for
proof, and they believe a
construction of reality which is

40
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:59,833
congruent with their altogether
present and previous
construction of reality rather

41
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:06,417
than allowing anomalous
information in because it
causing too much discomfort. We

42
00:05:06,417 --> 00:05:12,417
call that explanation the truth.
Then when we pass it around to
other people we have an agree

43
00:05:12,417 --> 00:05:18,417
and consensus and it becomes
orthodoxy and even scientific
truth. So let us begin. I'm

44
00:05:23,208 --> 00:05:29,000
going to talk about mind games,
my book I'll do a signing
tomorrow. Of course, I always

45
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:35,292
have a backpack heavier full of
books I can carry if someone
wants to buy one for a mere $20

46
00:05:35,292 --> 00:05:43,125
before then. How did I come to
write "Mind Games." I can talk
about it now more than I did

47
00:05:43,125 --> 00:05:49,125
before Snowden. Shortly after
9/11, because of the friends and
colleagues I made through this

48
00:05:56,625 --> 00:06:02,750
organizational structure such as
it is, there were some people
from the national security

49
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:08,375
agency who were very concerned
after 9/11 because the executive
order that came from the Bush

50
00:06:08,375 --> 00:06:12,750
White House asked them to do
things we'd never do because
it's contrary to the

51
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:17,333
Constitution and to the law.
They knew I'd write in the '90s
about technology would lead and

52
00:06:17,333 --> 00:06:23,333
transform not only geopolitical
boundaries and the way to behave
to those in the new world

53
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,667
constructed by the digital
transformation, but we had to
rethink ethics itself because

54
00:06:35,667 --> 00:06:41,208
the religious structures and the
way of thinking about the right
thing is transformed by the

55
00:06:41,208 --> 00:06:47,792
necessity of doing things which
prior to 9/11 and prior to World
War II, in fact, we found

56
00:06:47,792 --> 00:06:54,042
unthinkable because in the
construction reality by the
prior technology, they couldn't

57
00:06:54,042 --> 00:07:00,667
be done. They could after 9/11.
They had been contrary to the
constitution, and the law as

58
00:07:00,667 --> 00:07:07,167
they understood it because that
understanding was constructed,
as I say, by the framework

59
00:07:07,167 --> 00:07:12,833
created by prior technologies,
which shapes the context of our
lives. It's the ground in which

60
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:18,833
the figure of our lives is
drawn. So I began working with
some people there ad hoc

61
00:07:20,833 --> 00:07:26,833
off‑site for about a decade on
how to reframe ethical issues or
considerations in light of the

62
00:07:29,375 --> 00:07:35,000
brave new world that those
executive orders created. Make
no mistake, they came from Bush

63
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:40,792
originally because they had to,
but Obama is more Bush than Bush
on all of those issues as well

64
00:07:40,792 --> 00:07:46,208
as on privacy leaks and
punishing whistleblowers, and
most of you know that. It's what

65
00:07:46,208 --> 00:07:52,208
you do when you have the power
to do it. They were concerned
with how to inflect the

66
00:07:54,708 --> 00:08:00,042
conversation inside the agency,
if it was at all possible, in
the direction that took into

67
00:08:00,042 --> 00:08:07,500
account what was now happening
as a result of the new
instructions. So I worked with

68
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:11,542
them on those issues. We
reflected on it. I want to say
for the record nothing

69
00:08:11,542 --> 00:08:17,042
classified was ever shared in
those discussions. I know
nothing, nothing classified. No

70
00:08:17,042 --> 00:08:21,375
one said anything that was
classified, and if they did,
there was no way I knew it was

71
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:27,792
classified. So I get to stay in
America and live my life
happily, and I do not have to

72
00:08:27,792 --> 00:08:34,500
cow tow to my Russian feeders
who over a lifetime know how to
give the food, take the food

73
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:41,208
away, and ultimately assimilate
you into the long‑term plan they
have for you. So the

74
00:08:41,208 --> 00:08:48,042
conversations were about
sensitive issues, and the deputy
director says you can't discuss

75
00:08:48,042 --> 00:08:55,500
what you talk about with you
unless you write fiction.
Fiction is the only way to tell

76
00:08:55,500 --> 00:09:01,500
the truth. That rang such a bell
for me, because I found in the
book The Covert Sphere, there

77
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:09,417
was an academic in Ohio that
wrote a whole book on exactly
that same thing because

78
00:09:09,417 --> 00:09:16,333
post‑World War II fiction is the
only way to tell the truth, and
it's true for people inside the

79
00:09:16,333 --> 00:09:21,333
community as well. So I began
writing stories I published
about 35 and this year I will

80
00:09:21,333 --> 00:09:27,333
finish a novel called "Foam" and
20 or more stories reflected in
"Mind Games." Now. You can't

81
00:09:30,417 --> 00:09:36,417
read that. That's why the
challenger went down. They
couldn't read the slide about

82
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:46,958
the O‑ring. This is a tweet.
Now, I know a tweet is only 144
characters. I'm not as stupid as

83
00:09:52,042 --> 00:09:58,958
I look, but the top is the
tweet. It says compare this and
what he did this. Many things

84
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:04,250
that Snowden that had outed
using proprietary information,
and he said compare it with

85
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:11,917
this. What it's ‑‑ no, that
didn't work. What it's compared
with is a long passage that he

86
00:10:11,917 --> 00:10:18,833
photographed, and attached to
his tweet, which is the words of
a dying intelligence agent who

87
00:10:18,833 --> 00:10:24,417
said let me tell, in effect,
what we do. He did a point by
point comparison of what Snowden

88
00:10:24,417 --> 00:10:32,000
outed and what my short story
had said. When when the short
story was published, I got a

89
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:37,458
phone call from a different
friend at the agency, and he
said it reminds him of Three

90
00:10:37,458 --> 00:10:43,458
Days of the Condor. 95% of your
story isn't fiction, but you
have to know which 95% to have

91
00:10:48,167 --> 00:10:55,583
the key to the code. He was
right. We agreed that people
would think the stuff about

92
00:10:55,583 --> 00:11:02,250
Roswell,my little sci‑fi
scenarios of aliens crashing
their scout ship loaded with

93
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:08,958
computer chips and fiber optics
and the like so that humans
would build the Internet because

94
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:14,167
they are finding it so boring
and tedious to go to cocktail
parties in Georgetown to learn

95
00:11:14,167 --> 00:11:19,167
everything they could about us.
It was so much easier to give us
the means to build the Internet,

96
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:26,208
onto which we project the
content of our life and work and
souls. They can just download

97
00:11:26,208 --> 00:11:33,708
Earth‑thinking, which was much
more convenient. This is an age
of let me tell you what we do.

98
00:11:33,708 --> 00:11:37,625
The story is called "Zero Day
Roswell." It's all the things we
do because I know this is what

99
00:11:42,667 --> 00:11:48,667
we do. The story was published
in 2006. Now Tim Melley of the
academic I mentioned said this.

100
00:11:54,792 --> 00:11:59,750
When democracy relies on
entertainment to provide
knowledge of secret affairs, as,

101
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:05,750
in fact, all of the stories one
way or another in "mind games"
do, there's a blurring of

102
00:12:09,125 --> 00:12:15,125
fictional and real operations.
Now, here's an example. Animal
Farm was a full‑length animated

103
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:22,875
film. I still call them
cartoons. It was a full‑length
film of the George Orwell book

104
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:28,875
‑made by the CIA through other
fronts, and that was typical of
what was being done in the

105
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:49,292
1950s. It was the suspension of
democracy. A conscious decision
by the government to suspend

106
00:12:49,292 --> 00:12:56,750
democracy in its actions in
order to preserve democracy in
its fictional context, I.E., our

107
00:12:56,750 --> 00:13:04,333
lives. In that context the CIA
in the '50s and '60s because one
of the largest sponsors of art

108
00:13:04,333 --> 00:13:11,750
and literature in the world.
They stood up magazines and
periodicals. I took a course at

109
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:19,250
northwestern, for Stephen
Spender and he was the editor of
Encounter. Encounter for 20

110
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:23,958
years was the leading
non‑communist intellectual
periodical in Europe. He claimed

111
00:13:23,958 --> 00:13:30,875
at the end ‑‑ his wife said he
was so nieve he meant it ‑‑ he
said he did not know from the

112
00:13:30,875 --> 00:13:36,875
beginning to the end it was a
CIA operation, and there were 20
other major periodicals in the

113
00:13:40,625 --> 00:13:46,625
world and many others as well as
using the periodicals in the
media of the world or making

114
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:52,625
movies the CIA published not
under their own imprint over
1,000 books. In appointed itself

115
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:03,208
a ministry of culture to combat
the Soviet ministry of culture.
The way George Cannon put it,

116
00:14:03,208 --> 00:14:09,208
one of the formulators of our
foreign policy under Eisenhower,
and he said we need to act after

117
00:14:11,333 --> 00:14:17,875
the 1947 national security act
in a way the U.S. can publicly
disclaim any responsibility for

118
00:14:17,875 --> 00:14:22,875
the covert actions we do,
because Eisenhower realized
early on, you can read a book

119
00:14:22,875 --> 00:14:29,292
called Total Cold War, 600 pages
about that. Eisenhower realized
that in the absence of a nuclear

120
00:14:29,292 --> 00:14:35,500
exchange, which sane men and
women wouldn't have, the only
way to fight the Cold War was

121
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:42,667
through propaganda and
disinformation. There was no way
to do this disinformation that

122
00:14:42,667 --> 00:14:49,333
did not cause blow‑back and did
not include all the American
people in the false scenarios

123
00:14:49,333 --> 00:14:55,333
and creative narratives that
came out and through the media
into the mind of society without

124
00:14:57,375 --> 00:15:01,833
having everybody part of that
disinformation campaign. You
couldn't deceive the Soviets

125
00:15:01,833 --> 00:15:08,042
without deceiving the American
people, so the American people
themselves became subject to the

126
00:15:08,042 --> 00:15:15,875
propaganda campaign we
instituted in order to fight the
Cold War. I mentioned Cannon. He

127
00:15:15,875 --> 00:15:21,875
was a formulator of that policy.
There's also the brothers, John
Foster Dulles and Alan Dulles.

128
00:15:26,042 --> 00:15:34,042
John worked in tandem to create
the kind of world they did, and
they first overthrow the Iran

129
00:15:34,042 --> 00:15:40,708
over the behest of the British
who were afraid their oil
interests would be nationalized

130
00:15:40,708 --> 00:15:48,292
by a democratically elected head
of government. Then we did our
bends in Guatemala, and to do

131
00:15:48,292 --> 00:15:54,292
that Eisenhower caught on Eddie
Bearnaise, the father of spin to
do it properly. The whole

132
00:15:56,708 --> 00:16:04,583
religious system was used.
Priests said the lies to
promulgate from the parish to

133
00:16:04,583 --> 00:16:10,583
the faithful to fear him so they
would support the overthrow of a
democratically elected

134
00:16:14,292 --> 00:16:20,292
government. So the Cold War
became a war fought through
symbols, words, propaganda and

135
00:16:22,375 --> 00:16:28,583
still we have a military
presence one way or another in
about 150 countries. So we are

136
00:16:28,583 --> 00:16:36,333
still creating the same kind of
fictions that we began to do
then. It began under Eisenhower,

137
00:16:36,333 --> 00:16:43,750
Cannon sponsored it. He said
they fought up with unreality
and irrationalism. Can we

138
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:49,208
combat? The answer is no. They
lie and we have to lie. That's
the method of exchange, the

139
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:55,208
shaping of the mind of society
in the globe and in our country
as well. The problem was when

140
00:17:00,625 --> 00:17:05,542
you do that in a nation that is
now governed by
compartalization, one of the my

141
00:17:05,542 --> 00:17:11,292
friends said you know more about
the big picture of standing back
because you talk to so many

142
00:17:11,292 --> 00:17:17,417
different people and know how to
connect the dots. I'm
constrained. He only recently

143
00:17:17,417 --> 00:17:23,417
found out a program he worked on
that stood up for one purpose
had a completely different

144
00:17:25,417 --> 00:17:32,500
covert purpose, and none of the
people working on the program
knew what that ultimate real

145
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:39,000
intention and aim of that
program was for about 20 years
because they did not have a need

146
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:45,625
to know. Therefore, people
inside the IC are often
subjected to the same propaganda

147
00:17:45,625 --> 00:17:51,125
and narratives that we are
because they can't go elsewhere
inside the IC to ask what the

148
00:17:51,125 --> 00:17:58,458
truth is. Out here we kind of
can, but we can only express it
without fear of jail or exile in

149
00:17:58,458 --> 00:18:05,458
fiction. So let's look at an
example. The Search for the
Manchurian candidate. You're

150
00:18:05,458 --> 00:18:11,208
familiar with brainwashing as a
concept, correct? We all know
what brainwashing is. It's

151
00:18:11,208 --> 00:18:17,208
terrible, and it's to be feared.
We fall into the clutches of
evil‑doers or use drugs to

152
00:18:20,208 --> 00:18:26,750
bombard our brains, and pretty
soon we do what they said. The
Manchurian Candidate was then

153
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:29,042
turned into a movie with Frank
Sinatra. Brainwashing became
part of the fabric of our

154
00:18:29,042 --> 00:18:31,500
understanding of what the
Chinese and the Russians would
do our poor guys if they were

155
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:34,125
caught and subjected to it.
Let's look at where brainwashing
came from. It came from a guy

156
00:18:34,125 --> 00:18:36,583
named Edward Hunter who had
contracts with the CIA. He was
an agent of the CIA as he

157
00:18:36,583 --> 00:18:38,583
revealed. He invented the
concept of brainwashing as part
of a propaganda campaign to

158
00:18:38,583 --> 00:18:40,583
mobilize support for the massive
military buildup in the early
1950s. Dulles at state believed

159
00:18:40,583 --> 00:18:42,583
in what he read about
brainwashing. How could Dulles
buy that from his own agent?

160
00:18:42,583 --> 00:18:44,583
I'll give you another example of
that in a minute of how easily
that can happen thanks to

161
00:18:44,583 --> 00:18:46,583
secretary of state Hague and
what he showed us. So they
believed about brainwashing what

162
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:52,583
we came to believe about it. We
were in a panic about it, and we
needed to find out how it worked

163
00:19:25,417 --> 00:19:31,417
so we began experimenting on
North Korean prisoners in the
same insidious ways we said they

164
00:19:51,375 --> 00:19:57,250
were experimenting on us because
like the digital world, if
anything anywhere is a threat,

165
00:19:57,250 --> 00:20:03,500
you have to control the whole
world. That's the rationale of
our cyber thinking right now,

166
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:09,500
and our terroristic thinking
right now. Our intention in
dealing with brainwashing was to

167
00:20:11,625 --> 00:20:17,625
fuel anxiety about communism and
it's methods. Meanwhile, inside,
of necessity given what we

168
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:29,750
thought they were doing to us,
we needed to find out how these
methods worked. The programs

169
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:33,708
that we instituted, things like
BLUEBIRD, ARTICHOKE, MK-ULTRA.
We only know about the programs

170
00:20:33,708 --> 00:20:39,708
because they ordered all
references destroyed like
Indiana Jones in the warehouse.

171
00:20:43,792 --> 00:20:49,292
He forgot one box. There was one
box of 50,000 financial
documents which enabled us to

172
00:20:49,292 --> 00:20:54,042
connect the dots on what we were
doing and what the programs were
about, and that's the only

173
00:20:54,042 --> 00:21:00,500
reason we know about it. When I
asked the lead historian, what
can you and I discuss

174
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:06,833
historically with the assumption
by using the same words we
actually mean the same events,

175
00:21:06,833 --> 00:21:13,542
he laughed and he said, anything
up until World War II. He wasn't
kidding. It was kind of a joke,

176
00:21:13,542 --> 00:21:19,542
but he was saying that when this
world OSS morphing into CIA, it
was like listening to a symphony

177
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:28,250
with a lot of dead spaces. There
was a lot of maintained secrecy,
and it's hard to connect a dot

178
00:21:34,625 --> 00:21:40,625
to a non‑dot. Artichoke and
MK-ULTRA were horrific. A guy
was head of the psychiatric

179
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:50,333
association and we did it in
Canada and Montreal, so we had
plausible deniability. Do what

180
00:21:50,333 --> 00:21:56,333
you must, but keep my
fingerprints off it as
president. The things that

181
00:21:58,792 --> 00:22:04,792
Cameron were did were horrific.
He wiped peoples minds as much
as humanly possible and tried to

182
00:22:07,875 --> 00:22:15,000
reprogram and repattern. In
never worked. Why? Because the
Russian and the Chinese did not

183
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:20,375
have any exotic techniques. When
they turned people against us,
it was through the time‑honored

184
00:22:20,375 --> 00:22:26,917
techniques of brutality and
interrogation used with the
cultures of Chinese and Russian

185
00:22:26,917 --> 00:22:34,083
and the way they did things
always. There was nothing secret
or spooky about it, but these

186
00:22:34,083 --> 00:22:40,083
movies and these books put that
into our brains as a reality. So
the fiction created even more of

187
00:22:44,042 --> 00:22:51,542
a fiction, and the search for
what did not exist led to our
establishment of COOBAR, Counter

188
00:22:51,542 --> 00:22:57,833
Intellegence Operation manual,
which simulated brainwashing we
anticipated would be done to us

189
00:22:57,833 --> 00:23:04,333
and subjected our people to it
to prepare them for what they
thought they would do to us when

190
00:23:04,333 --> 00:23:11,750
we were captured. In fact, that
manual turned into our offensive
manual for interrogation and the

191
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:17,750
SEAR program. "The Unit" is a TV
program, and the episode 8 says
they participate in a training

192
00:23:22,333 --> 00:23:30,042
drill and treated as prisoners
of war. It pushes them to
medical and physical limits when

193
00:23:30,042 --> 00:23:36,625
their lives are in danger.
People watched that program on
television and believed it

194
00:23:36,625 --> 00:23:42,125
because fiction promulgated the
lie at a higher level of
reinforcement. It wasn't that

195
00:23:42,125 --> 00:23:48,833
successful in the series, but it
nevertheless seeped into the
minds of society. Then after

196
00:23:48,833 --> 00:23:53,833
9/11 when we were going to
interrogate prisoners and
torture them ‑‑ I don't mean

197
00:23:53,833 --> 00:24:01,625
water boards, which is the go to
poster boy for torture. I'm
talking about 'oops deaths' as

198
00:24:01,625 --> 00:24:09,083
an interrogation. Where you work
a little too hard and say, oops,
he's gone. You call in a doctor

199
00:24:09,083 --> 00:24:14,708
to falsify the death certificate
and say he died of natural
causes documented by Steve Miles

200
00:24:14,708 --> 00:24:17,542
in his concern about doctors
used in contrary in Nuremberg to
monitor torture and improve on

201
00:24:17,542 --> 00:24:23,542
it. The result came from going
point by point through thousands
of documents unearthed by the

202
00:24:30,333 --> 00:24:36,875
ACLU about who was where when an
interrogation took place and how
it was done, a subject which I

203
00:24:36,875 --> 00:24:40,875
talked to the bioethics at the
AMA about exploring a little
more, and he refused. He said if

204
00:24:40,875 --> 00:24:46,875
there's enough groundswell of
support for looking at that, we
will, but that's not our

205
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:55,750
concern. It isn't our concern,
but the irony is that manual
then became the template for how

206
00:24:55,750 --> 00:25:01,750
we interrogated and tortured
people all down the moebius
strip when that pseudojournalist

207
00:25:04,583 --> 00:25:10,125
working for the CIA created the
notion of brainwashing and it
began the long journey in my

208
00:25:10,125 --> 00:25:16,125
minds. Someone in in room is
saying, I don't want to know
that. I don't want to know that.

209
00:25:19,792 --> 00:25:24,958
I would rather do away with the
discomfort of knowing because if
the world you're describing is

210
00:25:24,958 --> 00:25:29,958
real, how do I know what is
real? Then the world tilts and
it's like riding the old rotor

211
00:25:29,958 --> 00:25:35,958
in Chicago. Therefore as
Nietzsche said you said you want
adopt reality that makes you

212
00:25:44,417 --> 00:25:50,417
feel better. My explanation to
how the government responded to
the UFO phenomenon is full of

213
00:25:52,458 --> 00:25:58,958
that kind of response. Okay. So
that's what happened with
brainwashing. Now, I said I

214
00:25:58,958 --> 00:26:05,042
would tell you how it is that we
come to know that we can deceive
ourselves because we need to

215
00:26:05,042 --> 00:26:12,625
know. What you look at is the
Soviet submarine, the K‑129 was
a nuclear submarine, and it went

216
00:26:12,625 --> 00:26:19,500
down. We wanted to retrieve it.
We didn't want the Soviets to
know we were retrieving it. Now,

217
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:25,667
along the assumptions I spelled
outed, this is what we did. This
is the Hughes Glomar Explorer

218
00:26:25,667 --> 00:26:31,917
built by sun ship to secretly
lift a sunken submarine. This
wasn't the only project. This

219
00:26:31,917 --> 00:26:37,917
was through Howard Hughes.
People have retired and are
dying and they want to say

220
00:26:42,208 --> 00:26:48,125
something. The burden of not
ever telling the truth about
your own life and your own

221
00:26:48,125 --> 00:26:55,375
reality someone told you the
other day about their
grandfather or father who was in

222
00:26:55,375 --> 00:27:00,875
the NSA and what it did for his
marriage to disappear for four
months at a time and come back

223
00:27:00,875 --> 00:27:05,792
and be able to say nothing. Or
as a friend of NSA said the
other day kind of chuckling, a

224
00:27:05,792 --> 00:27:10,708
young man was coming into the
agency and just got his
clearances and his parents that

225
00:27:10,708 --> 00:27:18,000
worked there were very
concerned. Why? He didn't know
they worked at NSA, and they had

226
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:23,750
lived with the family lie all
their lives. Do you see the very
basis, if you look at privacy

227
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:29,000
and the lack of it does to
intimacy or lack of truth
telling does to the possibility

228
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:34,042
of trust, you have those
examples throughout the
intelligence community where

229
00:27:34,042 --> 00:27:40,708
people are bound to people only
to one another in the agency but
not to anyone that matters in

230
00:27:40,708 --> 00:27:48,583
their lives except through lies.
The only way they can tell the
truth is through fiction. But

231
00:27:48,583 --> 00:27:55,208
never the whole classified
reality. I got a call from a
gentleman who was stood up by

232
00:27:55,208 --> 00:28:01,208
the CIA to create a proprietary
for a group like Hughes' group
that was going to build a deep

233
00:28:04,083 --> 00:28:10,583
sea diving submersible to let us
go get that submarine back up.
Why do it two times in why do it

234
00:28:10,583 --> 00:28:16,583
three times? One, because you
can like the dog in the joke
that I wrote with Pete, and two,

235
00:28:19,042 --> 00:28:24,208
because when you put people in
competition with each other in
genuine ways, it's going to spur

236
00:28:24,208 --> 00:28:30,417
creativity. Both of these
organizations did good deep sea
dives exploration and work. They

237
00:28:30,417 --> 00:28:34,250
made money. They were
successful, but the covert
purpose for which they really

238
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:39,375
existed was to create something
to bring back up the submarine.
You know how we had meetings

239
00:28:39,375 --> 00:28:45,000
about that and this is where you
say to me, all people can't keep
secrets, yes, they can. The

240
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:49,125
meetings take place deep
undergrounds in bunkers and
people go way down. We would

241
00:28:49,125 --> 00:28:55,833
have our conversations, come up,
and the meeting never happened.
There are no records. There are

242
00:28:55,833 --> 00:29:02,083
no notes. If you use the freedom
of information act as friends in
Interpol and FBI said you won't

243
00:29:02,083 --> 00:29:06,917
get what you want know because
they learned how to game the
system and use code to put them

244
00:29:06,917 --> 00:29:11,875
in a different file that has a
different name you will never
know. Therefore, your request

245
00:29:11,875 --> 00:29:17,292
won't be honored with the
documents you seek. If a few
turn up, it costs a lot of money

246
00:29:17,292 --> 00:29:24,292
for copying. He led that
project, and within a few weeks,
just weeks before it was

247
00:29:24,292 --> 00:29:28,208
finished, he had to leave and
move on something else. When he
saw someone they had worked

248
00:29:28,208 --> 00:29:35,250
during the project, it went
down. Part of it fell back down
and part came up. What we

249
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:40,125
received from that information
is still classified, and he
asked his colleague and friend,

250
00:29:40,125 --> 00:29:45,375
so what did we find when we
down? He said, I'm sorry, you're
on a need to know because you're

251
00:29:45,375 --> 00:29:51,167
not on the project anymore. So
he like me and all of us had to
wait 20 years for the whole

252
00:29:51,167 --> 00:29:57,500
project to be declassified. Like
MK ultra. I refer to Susan
Hassler in the notes on the disk

253
00:29:57,500 --> 00:30:01,750
hou received. She wrote two
great books worth reading,
intelligence, how the agency's

254
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:07,750
alien got there. The second book
is about project MK Ultra and
how they tested drugs on people

255
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:19,208
and did to people. She can only
talk about it now because it's
distant in time and no longer a

256
00:30:19,208 --> 00:30:25,000
threat. That's a thing you have
to do, is just wait. Wait until
it's no longer potent, and then

257
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:30,500
you can tell more of the truth
and it doesn't matter anymore.
Susan's first book in the review

258
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:36,500
of "Intelligence" on your disk
and on the Amazon site is there
was enough white, hot anger in

259
00:30:39,125 --> 00:30:45,125
this book to steam a skunk. She
was so angry over the
politicization during the Bush

260
00:30:52,625 --> 00:30:58,625
administration. Post‑9/11 she
worked with a cadre of people to
connected dots. Even someone

261
00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:10,250
working on the project might not
even know what it's about or
where it winds up. That's unless

262
00:31:10,250 --> 00:31:16,250
somebody writes a story about
it, the Manchurian Candidate.
They're committed to strategic

263
00:31:19,667 --> 00:31:27,167
fictions, simulations and
deceptions. The mind of society
must become confused about what

264
00:31:27,167 --> 00:31:33,708
is real and rely on post‑modern
deconstruction in a futile
attempt on what is happening in

265
00:31:33,708 --> 00:31:39,458
the wilderness. I remember
sitting in the rain with a
friend from NSA and told him

266
00:31:39,458 --> 00:31:45,167
what I thought was going on. He
said, noticing my symptoms of
secondary trauma, which were

267
00:31:45,167 --> 00:31:50,750
very real and predictable from
the conversations I was having
with people including those that

268
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:58,667
tortured and were tortured, he
said you know enough to know
what's not true, but you can't

269
00:31:58,667 --> 00:32:04,167
necessarily connect all of the
dots to know what is true. You
have to learn to live with that

270
00:32:04,167 --> 00:32:09,833
ambiguity and anxiety in your
constant need‑to‑know machine
effort to find out what was real

271
00:32:09,833 --> 00:32:12,500
in your life. When I was growing
up seeking what was real and
acting on it is what we were

272
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:18,500
called to do as human beings. I
didn't know it would undermine
that very project and make it

273
00:32:23,167 --> 00:32:30,000
impossible to complain, which is
why I saw the red pill turns
into a lavender pill. The most

274
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:35,625
effective way of doing this kind
of propaganda is not just to
lie. It is to provide a mixture

275
00:32:35,625 --> 00:32:41,250
of truth, half‑truths, and lies.
That's the best propaganda, and
that's the most effective,

276
00:32:43,417 --> 00:32:48,250
because it can connect like
children's blocks plugging into
one an other with the schemes

277
00:32:48,250 --> 00:32:54,792
and narratives already in our
heads snapping in place like
those beads. If it connects to

278
00:32:54,792 --> 00:33:01,667
what we already believe is true
and sounds like that, we will
build the module up in our minds

279
00:33:01,667 --> 00:33:07,667
and believe it is true. So this
can get us in a real, real mess.
Let me give you an example.

280
00:33:11,875 --> 00:33:17,875
There's Alexander Hague.
Secretary of state. This is
where it began in a small

281
00:33:19,958 --> 00:33:25,833
Italian newspaper where a piece
of really great investigative
reporting revealed that the KGB

282
00:33:25,833 --> 00:33:31,167
during the Cold War was
sponsoring terrorism all over
the world and supporting groups.

283
00:33:31,167 --> 00:33:37,167
That small story caught the
attention of an author and
journalist who wrote a piece

284
00:33:39,208 --> 00:33:43,250
about it for "The New York
Times" and also wrote a book
about it. That came to the

285
00:33:43,250 --> 00:33:48,292
attention of Alexander Hague who
was secretary of state. He
became very, very alarmed and

286
00:33:48,292 --> 00:33:55,167
held a press conference in which
he demanded that the CIA explore
this revelation to encounter the

287
00:33:55,167 --> 00:34:03,000
nefarious and insidious work of
the KGB in this way. The
directive of the CIA said we'll

288
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:07,833
get right on it, and six months
later the result came back,
we've explored that, and you

289
00:34:07,833 --> 00:34:12,542
don't have to worry about that
particular thing. Why? Because
the story in the Italian

290
00:34:12,542 --> 00:34:19,917
newspaper was a CIA plant in the
first place. In other words, it
was just propaganda to smear the

291
00:34:19,917 --> 00:34:25,958
Soviets but it was picked up by
other own journalists who didn't
know any better and turned into

292
00:34:25,958 --> 00:34:32,417
a book that went to the
secretary of state and became an
alarming consideration. The CIA

293
00:34:32,417 --> 00:34:39,042
could not tell them the truth.
Well, finding out what is true
is not easy. You know the story

294
00:34:39,042 --> 00:34:45,833
of the gnome in the woods. He
went to find the gold. He has to
tell the truth. Which is the

295
00:34:45,833 --> 00:34:53,583
tree under which the gold is
buried. The gnome pointed. He
tied a scarf around the tree,

296
00:34:53,583 --> 00:34:59,583
and you have to promise not to
remove the scarf. The gnome
promised he wouldn't. He kept

297
00:35:01,875 --> 00:35:07,875
his promise. He didn't remove
the scarf but tied one around
every tree in the forest. This

298
00:35:10,375 --> 00:35:17,375
is what it becomes like to find
the gold, of the truth. In the
book last year, UFOs and

299
00:35:17,375 --> 00:35:23,667
historic inquiry, it's in over
50 university libraries now.
Yale, university of Chicago and

300
00:35:23,667 --> 00:35:29,167
university of Basil in
Switzerland. Why? It's
bulletproof. We only use

301
00:35:29,167 --> 00:35:35,792
documents over half a century
our team of nine unearthed to
show how it responded in light

302
00:35:35,792 --> 00:35:41,792
of national security concerns.
Even though we promulgate that
information, it will be

303
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:50,500
forgotten as soon as we said it.
In the draft in the '60s it
turned young people into the

304
00:35:53,750 --> 00:35:59,375
streets. It didn't reach into
the lives of normal middle class
Americans like the depression

305
00:35:59,375 --> 00:36:05,375
did in the '30s, and there's
motivated forgetting. We have
the experience or we hear the

306
00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:13,750
words, and then we don't
remember it. The machinery of
deception and cover of

307
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:22,250
illusions, misdirection and
distraction and if necessary
ridicule or silence by

308
00:36:22,250 --> 00:36:28,250
authoritative voices, it just
reinforces that fact. So this is
from the UFO story as we told it

309
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:39,250
last year. I'm just pointing out
that this was used as an example
of cover and deception. This is

310
00:36:39,250 --> 00:36:45,375
what the CIA decided in 1953
after UFO sightings over
Washington. The reports are a

311
00:36:45,375 --> 00:36:51,375
matter of national security.
Military personnel should be
trained in the operation. That

312
00:36:54,125 --> 00:37:00,792
policy really has never stopped.
Study them. Learn what we can
about the technology. Do not

313
00:37:00,792 --> 00:37:05,750
allow our enemies to learn what
we know about the technology or
even believe they exist, and so

314
00:37:05,750 --> 00:37:11,125
out of necessity the citizens of
the United States ridiculed and
debunked and rejected were

315
00:37:11,125 --> 00:37:18,167
treated as if they were enemies.
That's what he said when he
finally gave up, the astronomer.

316
00:37:18,167 --> 00:37:23,375
He said the public was, in fact,
placed in the role of the enemy
against him counterespionage

317
00:37:23,375 --> 00:37:30,083
tactics must be employed. I
thought people that took an
interest in UFOs and wanted to

318
00:37:30,083 --> 00:37:36,042
know about them were treated as
enemies. It's not just about
that but everything Snowden did

319
00:37:36,042 --> 00:37:42,042
as well. Do you know who that
is? Somebody tell me who that
is. Thank you. Everybody knows

320
00:37:44,708 --> 00:37:49,292
who Jack Bauer is. If I showed
you Hague and asked that
question, very few would know

321
00:37:49,292 --> 00:37:56,125
who it was. But you know who
Jack Bauer is. Listen to this
quote now from justice Scalia

322
00:37:56,125 --> 00:38:02,125
citing "24." as relevant
background for jurisprudence.
This is a quote. Jack Bauer

323
00:38:04,750 --> 00:38:11,875
saved Los Angeles. He saved
hundreds of thousands of lives.
Recalling season 2 where his

324
00:38:11,875 --> 00:38:17,625
rough interrogation actions
saved California, the Supreme
Court judge etched a line in the

325
00:38:17,625 --> 00:38:23,458
sand. Are you going to convict
Jack Bauer? He challenged his
fellow judges and said the

326
00:38:23,458 --> 00:38:30,250
criminal law is against him and
doesn't matter. Is there any
jury in America that will

327
00:38:30,250 --> 00:38:37,625
convict Jack Bauer? I don't
think so. So the question this
wonderful jurist concluded is

328
00:38:37,625 --> 00:38:43,625
whether we believe in absolutes.
His decision, obviously, was to
believe them. Well, the

329
00:38:46,542 --> 00:38:52,542
Earth‑to‑Scalia communication
was, Jack Bauer doesn't exist.
It's fiction. The way the

330
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:02,000
program was promulgated through
the program "24 ‑‑" Robbie
Graham is doing a wonderful book

331
00:39:04,792 --> 00:39:11,583
on UFOs, but it's how they
manipulated and managed that
program, which I just mentioned

332
00:39:11,583 --> 00:39:15,833
in passing to debunk the
citizenry. We're going to
debunked media, and it's all

333
00:39:15,833 --> 00:39:21,833
documented if I have time to
again ‑‑ I'll say something
right now. "Space Wars." I

334
00:39:27,458 --> 00:39:33,458
couldn't get people to listen
could impair our satellite
functions significantly, and he

335
00:39:43,125 --> 00:39:48,500
was told by a director in
Hollywood and told me this. You
make one mistake from the podium

336
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:55,208
in what you say is true, you're
ridiculed and your reputation is
destroyed. Through the various

337
00:39:55,208 --> 00:40:02,125
wrap‑around reinforcing outlets
of media, the mouthpieces that
are used, you will no longer

338
00:40:02,125 --> 00:40:07,542
have credibility. If you make it
fiction, he said, it's mind
candy. Here in Hollywood we've

339
00:40:07,542 --> 00:40:12,583
done that about things for a
long, long times. Mind candy
goes down easily, and they take

340
00:40:12,583 --> 00:40:18,583
it for what it is. So he wrote a
novel called "Space Wars" to get
the point across. It also keeps

341
00:40:22,792 --> 00:40:28,792
him safe. I don't want to go
there. Well, all right, I'll go
there. Okay. You know who that

342
00:40:36,208 --> 00:40:43,917
is, right? More of you would
recognize Dustin Hoffman playing
Carl Bernstein. Look at the face

343
00:40:43,917 --> 00:40:51,583
and posture. This is what it
looks like to be a lean and
hungry reporter who wants to do

344
00:40:51,583 --> 00:40:57,583
investigative reporting. Flash
forward to this. I asked him
about the article he wrote for

345
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:07,292
"Rolling Stone" in 1978, about
20,000 words and he documented
all the journalists, media, CBS,

346
00:41:07,292 --> 00:41:13,292
time life, Cronkite, back at
the ‑‑ they wanted to use Arthur
got free and use Walter Cronkite

347
00:41:19,250 --> 00:41:25,250
to debunk it. You showed how the
journalists and media were lock
step from the '50s and '60s now,

348
00:41:29,458 --> 00:41:35,458
what did you say about that now?
To my astonishment he said the
boys from CIA don't have time

349
00:41:37,625 --> 00:41:42,625
for that now. This is lean and
hungry. This is what he looked
like when he said this. 400

350
00:41:42,625 --> 00:41:50,000
pounds later there's a
significant suggestion you have
become assimilated by the very

351
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:56,000
powers against which you so
hungrily pursued the truth at
one time. We'll go back to that

352
00:41:58,250 --> 00:42:04,250
in a moment. What did we do with
UFOs in TV. There was a comic
strip called Steve Canyon turned

353
00:42:07,375 --> 00:42:15,333
into a tv program and it had a
single serious episode on UFOs.
I have to find out what's

354
00:42:15,333 --> 00:42:21,333
happening. The Air Force took
the script and rewrote it.
Instead of saying as canyon did

355
00:42:24,125 --> 00:42:30,708
in the first script, the person
making the report is a solid
citizen. Instead, they changed

356
00:42:30,708 --> 00:42:36,583
it so he was having skepticism
and said it wasn't worth
investigating and he got that

357
00:42:36,583 --> 00:42:42,583
point across. You don't have to
take my word for it. Charles
Lewis just wrote a book called

358
00:42:44,917 --> 00:42:51,542
"935 Lies," and he talks about
his experience in journalism
working at CBS on "60 Minutes."

359
00:42:51,542 --> 00:42:57,542
Every time they prepare a piece
about someone think with Don
Hewitt or other executives at

360
00:43:01,292 --> 00:43:08,083
CBS, they were told not to touch
it. If anyone with suggest
influence and power. When he

361
00:43:08,083 --> 00:43:14,708
worked with Aldridge, he killed
a tough story on tobacco because
Philip Morris was in the process

362
00:43:14,708 --> 00:43:20,708
of engaging in a lawsuit at the
time. I talked before about Jean
Pope at national inquirer in

363
00:43:23,292 --> 00:43:29,250
1952 was doing psychological
operations for the CIA and
invented the National Enquirer

364
00:43:29,250 --> 00:43:35,250
in '63. The money came from
frank Costello and the Mafia to
sustain it all the time in the

365
00:43:38,458 --> 00:43:44,458
red. When he died, the eulogy at
his funeral was delivered by the
Secretary of Defense at the

366
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:54,500
time. So I'm not making this up.
Let me quote from the 1991 task
for report compiled by the CIA

367
00:43:54,500 --> 00:44:00,500
director. The newly appointed
openness task force. It says,
and I'm quoting now, in '91, the

368
00:44:05,208 --> 00:44:10,375
CIA has relations with reporters
from every major wire service,
newspaper, news weekly and

369
00:44:10,375 --> 00:44:16,250
television network in the
nation. They have turned
intelligence failure stories

370
00:44:16,250 --> 00:44:21,417
into intelligence success
stories. It contributed to the
accuracy of countless others as

371
00:44:21,417 --> 00:44:29,292
we consider accuracy. It reveals
that the CIA has persuaded
reporters to postpone, change,

372
00:44:29,292 --> 00:44:35,500
hold or scrap stories that could
adversely affect national
securities interests as we

373
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:41,500
constituted. So, let's see. It's
almost time, so I'm going to
bring this to a conclusion by

374
00:44:43,792 --> 00:44:50,500
pointing out that strip is
serious. In this book "Mind
Games" there's a 0-Day Roswell

375
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:57,875
story. There's one called "break
memory" about how the masters of
society moderate the media and

376
00:44:57,875 --> 00:45:03,875
work on hackers at the end and
the quote from the intelligence
agent is we're not amateurs. We

377
00:45:07,208 --> 00:45:13,292
do this for a living. You don't
want to spend your life to the
corner of he can foreign embassy

378
00:45:13,292 --> 00:45:20,292
and in solitary being tortured.
You don't want to live in Russia
without any hope of getting out.

379
00:45:20,292 --> 00:45:27,625
You want to take seriously what
this is. I have two stories in
here, versions of each other

380
00:45:27,625 --> 00:45:33,750
Northward Into the Night which
reveal in one story two layers
and another three layers. I have

381
00:45:33,750 --> 00:45:39,750
one called more than a dream
about an encounter with it and I
have Incident at Wolf Cove that

382
00:45:43,875 --> 00:45:49,875
shows the events on the psyche
of a human being. It's all in
here. It's the only way to tell

383
00:45:52,542 --> 00:45:58,542
the truth. It's the only way a
spy novelist, a Frenchman, can
tell the truth. You may not know

384
00:46:00,667 --> 00:46:05,833
his name. I'm just going to
throw out that he wrote an
astonishing story about Libya,

385
00:46:05,833 --> 00:46:12,292
and what would happen there
three months before  ‑‑ three
months before it happened. He

386
00:46:12,292 --> 00:46:19,375
did a novel about Syria and the
assassination in Lebanon, and he
named all the names and the

387
00:46:19,375 --> 00:46:24,750
names were accurate. People go
to him and read him, even though
they say they don't because it's

388
00:46:24,750 --> 00:46:30,458
pulpfiction, but it's always
accurate. He was invited to
dinner with the minister of

389
00:46:30,458 --> 00:46:35,708
Defense of France. He said why
did you ask me? It's clear you
and I have exactly the same

390
00:46:35,708 --> 00:46:41,708
sources. He's not even read
here. Only one book is in
English translation. I think I

391
00:46:45,708 --> 00:46:51,708
put in the bibliography the spy
novelist who knows too much. You
can't read it, but if you want

392
00:46:57,125 --> 00:47:01,417
it, give me your card afterwards
or connect with me at
thiemeworks.com and I'll be glad

393
00:47:01,417 --> 00:47:08,792
to respond with anything you
want to know. I always say I
belong to this community and the

394
00:47:08,792 --> 00:47:15,917
seeking of truth. It's the true
hacker ethos and the hacker
heart. It is a lot like the

395
00:47:15,917 --> 00:47:21,667
game. The guy came into the
western town to play and went to
saloon and watched the roulette

396
00:47:21,667 --> 00:47:28,167
for a while, and he said this
game is crooked. I know, but
it's the only game in town. You

397
00:47:28,167 --> 00:47:35,750
may not be able to play to win,
but you got to play or else the
red pill isn't a lavender pill

398
00:47:35,750 --> 00:47:39,292
but it's a blue pill and you
holding on. So connecting with
one another in stealthy,

399
00:47:47,708 --> 00:47:54,167
appropriate ways to discover the
truth, in order to strategize to
find a way in little ways to act

400
00:47:54,167 --> 00:47:59,625
on it in any way that might make
a difference. That's really the
heart of the hacker ethos. I

401
00:47:59,625 --> 00:48:06,875
have a couple of minutes, and
there's no Q and A room anymore.
I'll take Q and A up there at

402
00:48:06,875 --> 00:48:12,875
the bar or wherever I see you.
If you have a question now ‑‑
got a question back there? Are

403
00:48:15,583 --> 00:48:21,583
you just waving at me? Anybody
have a question? Yes.
( Inaudible question ) >> I'm

404
00:48:34,458 --> 00:48:40,458
familiar with the book. My
thoughts on ‑‑ ( Inaudible
question ) >> That's possible.

405
00:48:59,083 --> 00:49:02,917
That's all I can say, is that's
possible. There's different
scenarios. I learned during the

406
00:49:02,917 --> 00:49:07,500
research for the UFO book unless
we nail it town and make it
bulletproof, all you can say is

407
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:13,500
that's interesting. That's all I
can say. Anybody else? Question?
Where? ( Inaudible question ) >>

408
00:49:19,125 --> 00:49:25,125
When my friends, the Deputy
Director for Homeland Defense at
the NSA said to me directly, you

409
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:43,292
can't talk about what we talked
about with you. Then he paused
and he said, unless you start

410
00:49:43,292 --> 00:49:48,542
writing fiction. Fiction is the
only way to tell the truth.
That's a literal translation of

411
00:49:48,542 --> 00:49:54,833
a conversation we had
personally. I returned to
writing short stories. I

412
00:49:54,833 --> 00:50:02,083
published 35 of them and I'm
about to finish a novel. Mind
games is about four kinds of

413
00:50:02,083 --> 00:50:06,750
nonconsensual reality.
Intelligence work, hackers,
encounters with alien

414
00:50:06,750 --> 00:50:13,083
civilizations and deep states of
consciousness and what we see
and experience when we genuinely

415
00:50:13,083 --> 00:50:19,792
have the courage to explore the
psychic connections between us
and who we are as a composite

416
00:50:19,792 --> 00:50:26,542
organism. There's four kinds of
stories and that's when I did
it. What he was saying made

417
00:50:26,542 --> 00:50:31,917
sense, and we took very deadly
seriously the almost failed
effort to inflect the

418
00:50:31,917 --> 00:50:37,625
conversation inside. We know how
it hasn't happened, but there
are words inside in policy that

419
00:50:37,625 --> 00:50:42,708
suggest people do something
along the lines we suggested
that this is a huge issue. When

420
00:50:42,708 --> 00:50:48,417
your task is to defend and
protect Americans, you
understand it and put everything

421
00:50:48,417 --> 00:50:54,458
else on the back burner. When
you go to the White House and
they hand you the briefing, any

422
00:50:54,458 --> 00:51:00,458
human being says what you can do
to stop these? When they say do
this, this and this. You say do

423
00:51:03,917 --> 00:51:09,917
it. Do anything humanly possible
to stop that. Questions later?
Okay. Thank you very, very much.

424
00:51:13,667 --> 00:51:15,917
I appreciate it. ( Applause )
