1
00:00:00,333 --> 00:00:06,625
Welcome everybody. This is the
diversity in information
security panel. I am going to be

2
00:00:06,625 --> 00:00:14,040
shuffled off to the right a
little bit. So we're going to
clear the air before we turn it

3
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:19,660
over to the panel real quick
about a lot of different things
about this panel. There is

4
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:23,333
obviously a lot of strife to get
something like this in. Should
it be here, Does it need to be

5
00:00:23,333 --> 00:00:31,553
here? Why is it here? There's
not problemâ€¦There is a problem.
All these wild things of why we

6
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:37,540
shouldn't do this and the simple
answer that I have for all that
is we should do it because we

7
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:41,660
should do it. Just get it out of
the way and do it. I don't have
to explain why we should do it.

8
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:46,333
You are all here because you get
that we should have done it and
your presence here says that's

9
00:00:46,333 --> 00:00:53,417
the right decision that we do
this. It's a lot of warnings and
this is cheesy sounding and

10
00:00:53,417 --> 00:00:59,375
everything, for a simple matter
of appeasement we'll use the
trigger words, yadda yadda

11
00:00:59,375 --> 00:01:05,292
yadda. You're familiar with what
this is, this panel may not be
for you. This is for people that

12
00:01:05,292 --> 00:01:12,292
are not really in that scene
that already get it. This is for
people that are just curious. I

13
00:01:12,292 --> 00:01:20,167
don't see a problem. People keep
saying there is a problem. Can
people just be frank with me. In

14
00:01:20,167 --> 00:01:26,125
here, there is no witch hunt. We
have these microphones. You can
ask something incredibly weird

15
00:01:26,125 --> 00:01:32,920
and strange whether it's women
in technology or minority. I
know the audience maybe

16
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:41,520
cringing, we did a very small
intimate 35 person group last
year in this format that went so

17
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:45,200
well that people are like I know
you're going to judge me for the
rest of my life but I have to

18
00:01:45,208 --> 00:01:50,000
ask this one thing. This is that
safe place to ask that one
thing. Maybe somebody in the

19
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,667
audience doesn't like this at
all is going to be twittering
and we should find out who he is

20
00:01:55,667 --> 00:01:59,958
and attack him or her. But in
this room right now we're not
going to judge you for it. >> --

21
00:01:59,958 --> 00:02:04,875
I have to go through --
(inaudible) I don't need a mic.
Please, ask the questions. We're

22
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:17,760
(inaudible) He is being a
dick, don't be a dick. That's
all. >> If you're not on the mic

23
00:02:32,583 --> 00:02:38,583
you're not on DT TV. Good. Less
people for evidence. And all of
you in you rooms playing along

24
00:02:55,917 --> 00:03:04,917
from home, we're trying to be
open and honest. We want you to
have the same courtesy there.

25
00:03:04,917 --> 00:03:11,125
Other things to bring up. This
is a very, very widely diverse
panel and we're going to start

26
00:03:11,125 --> 00:03:16,042
with the not so obvious ones and
move to the obvious ones. The
obvious ones is we have people

27
00:03:16,042 --> 00:03:23,917
here that work at fortune 500
companies and premier companies
and wonderful and well respected

28
00:03:23,917 --> 00:03:31,625
educational institutes. And a
lot of them are well-known
people having done a lot of

29
00:03:31,625 --> 00:03:37,625
reverse engineering, a lot of
research. These are the doers of
your industry. And along with

30
00:03:37,625 --> 00:03:43,620
the doers these are the up and
coming people that are quickly
becoming doers. It's very

31
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:52,200
diverse, just people getting
into CS, computer science to
people in it for a long time and

32
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:59,742
just crushing it. Well you're at
the beginner side. Do you have
imposter syndrome? >> Well I

33
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:12,500
work for the Gov and I am now a
section chief, so I am not
innovative or anything else >>

34
00:04:14,917 --> 00:04:21,542
So that's the not so obvious
thing just by looking, all of
these people, you know, they're

35
00:04:21,542 --> 00:04:28,917
very active in the info -- all
are active at DEFCON and all
have been here two years. Some

36
00:04:28,917 --> 00:04:35,542
have been here since the very
first one. You're getting a wide
range of people that understand

37
00:04:35,542 --> 00:04:42,125
the culture and understand
DEFCON and the good, the bad,
and the ugly that have come and

38
00:04:42,125 --> 00:04:48,375
gone throughout the years. There
are gay people on this panel.
There are black people. There

39
00:04:48,375 --> 00:04:53,458
are transgender people. There
are minorities on this panel.
There is -- we'll get to that.

40
00:04:53,458 --> 00:04:59,458
He is handicapped. Handy
capable. There are just very
young people, there are much

41
00:05:02,583 --> 00:05:08,583
older people. So you're covering
everything. Ageism, sexism, you
know, fear of transgender. All

42
00:05:13,958 --> 00:05:20,958
that -- it's all here and
they're all sacrificing their
plight to take these questions

43
00:05:20,958 --> 00:05:26,917
and talk about this stuff. So
with this, one of the obvious
things that people love to

44
00:05:26,917 --> 00:05:32,917
Tweet, let me get this straight,
you have an entitled white guy
as your moderator of the

45
00:05:36,958 --> 00:05:42,958
diversity panel? Yes. Well, I'm
from California. As of this year
I'm a minority in California.

46
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:53,500
But, that's just a small joke.
You need to see me as the
moderator, as the API. You're

47
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:03,833
all the people, you're supposed
to be able to say, hey, I get
it. I'm trying to translate

48
00:06:03,833 --> 00:06:09,833
this. I know what it is to be a
white guy and be a married to a
minority. And have a daughter

49
00:06:13,417 --> 00:06:19,417
that all she wants to do is play
with Legos and stuff like that.
I'm seeing it from a perspective

50
00:06:22,125 --> 00:06:28,125
of other people, I'm white and I
don't see the problem. I've seen
quite a bit of it over the years

51
00:06:31,292 --> 00:06:37,292
and I'm trying to be an API --
succinct and to the point about
things. He doesn't cut corners.

52
00:06:39,542 --> 00:06:46,958
When it comes to this he wrote a
very great response on Bruce
Schneiders blog about the

53
00:06:46,958 --> 00:06:53,500
accusations of harassment alt
DEFCON and how we handle those
things. Making sure that DEFCON

54
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:59,500
is a safe place to be. He is the
go-to guy. He is not a minority
in the traditional sense but he

55
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:10,208
is here as a representative. So
we can get that stuff out of the
way. This doesn't look like what

56
00:07:10,208 --> 00:07:16,292
I thought it was. This is what
we're setting up for you just so
you understand. >> I have been

57
00:07:16,292 --> 00:07:22,292
on public transportation where
you wouldn't believe the crap
that you hear in those

58
00:07:24,917 --> 00:07:30,917
languages. I do want to
reiterate at the beginning here,
we have a zero tolerance. It is

59
00:07:34,125 --> 00:07:40,125
not allowed. Period. Full stop.
You should feel safe and free to
approach anyone with a red badge

60
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:54,875
or red shirt at any time. If you
feel you do not get the
appropriate level of response or

61
00:07:54,875 --> 00:08:02,042
the response was inappropriate,
find me. I am here from 8 in the
morning until 3 or 4 in the

62
00:08:02,042 --> 00:08:08,042
morning every day. It will not
be tolerated. It's not allowed.
One of my personal pet peeves, I

63
00:08:11,792 --> 00:08:17,792
do a lot of standing outreach.
There are not enough -- like I
said -- woman and minorities in

64
00:08:23,792 --> 00:08:30,625
the STEM. And it's so
frustrating to walk into a
classroom where, oh you're so

65
00:08:30,625 --> 00:08:36,625
pretty, don't be smart, you're
so pretty. And have that girl
ask a question. I just light up.

66
00:08:39,792 --> 00:08:45,792
Someone said she's smart. >> I
swear I'm going to pass it over
to you but one plug. This panel

67
00:08:47,875 --> 00:08:55,833
was organized and put together
by -- 2.0. They had a fundraiser
party last nights. Part of the

68
00:08:55,833 --> 00:09:01,542
national center for women and
technology. We're the largest
organization pushing for women

69
00:09:01,542 --> 00:09:07,292
in information technology in the
United States. We're the only
information security group

70
00:09:07,292 --> 00:09:13,500
representing there. So it's, we
feel it's our responsibility as
stewards of the information

71
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:19,500
community for you to give us
feed back so we can get feed
back to them. They're focused in

72
00:09:21,875 --> 00:09:29,167
education and foreign 500. They
have soft spots in information
security and we feel it's our

73
00:09:29,167 --> 00:09:36,458
job to hear from you, hear your
responses even if we don't agree
with them, pass them straight

74
00:09:36,458 --> 00:09:43,917
through and say these are things
that people bring up of concern.
Keep that in mind afterwards.

75
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:49,917
Come find us and we'll be happy
to facilitate that. Emily you
wanted to add something? >> Yes.

76
00:09:55,667 --> 00:10:01,667
NCWIT I spoke at their summit a
year or two ago. NCWIT has a
high school competition for

77
00:10:07,417 --> 00:10:14,083
girls 9th grade through 12th.
It's a scholarship opportunity
and award. If the girls go to

78
00:10:14,083 --> 00:10:17,958
the state level they have an
award ceremony. They get a
trophy and cash prizes and

79
00:10:17,958 --> 00:10:23,958
scholarship for college.
NCWIT.org. And look at their
scholarship. >> Now we'll kick

80
00:10:29,792 --> 00:10:35,792
it off. I want to start with
mouse. We should do
introductions. After that I

81
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:46,000
would like you to kick off the
panel. Scott, we'll start with
you. >> Your name, your industry

82
00:10:52,083 --> 00:10:57,583
or where you work. >> My name is
Scott. I'm a gay man who has
been working in the industry for

83
00:10:57,583 --> 00:11:03,833
almost 20 years now, information
technology and IT. Working for a
multinational company, foreign

84
00:11:03,833 --> 00:11:09,833
500. Working for -- industry
now. It's really interesting to
see what we've had happen. >> My

85
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:21,750
name is little jinni and I'm
half way through schooling for
informatics. I'm going to

86
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:27,750
combine the big data initiatives
and layer in information
security to that. It's kind of

87
00:11:30,292 --> 00:11:36,292
interesting to layer that in.
I'm also Mexican and I'm also
female. >> I'm sandy Clark known

88
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:46,458
as mouse. I'm an adult that is
getting a Ph.D. I'm at
university of Pennsylvania.

89
00:11:46,458 --> 00:11:52,458
We'll talk more about the
ecosystem later. >> I'm Jolly.
I'm technically homeless

90
00:11:55,625 --> 00:12:01,625
although people say that doesn't
count. This is going to shock
you but I have a turban. I know.

91
00:12:04,333 --> 00:12:10,625
I know. I just thought it was a
built in pillow. I left my magic
carpet at home. Other fun things

92
00:12:10,625 --> 00:12:18,500
I have a slight addiction of
conferences and I mean in 2012,
I went to 26. I've probably done

93
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:25,667
more this year and also dancing
and CTF's. >> I'm Emily. Working
as a college student trying to

94
00:12:25,667 --> 00:12:30,708
build a company that focuses on
educational technology. I'm
working just to increase better,

95
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:36,125
more open source, educational
resources. >> My name is Vyrus
I'm probably the most defensive

96
00:12:36,125 --> 00:12:43,708
person that is going to grab the
microphone today. This is my
12th DEFCON. I'm part of a group

97
00:12:43,708 --> 00:12:49,708
called DC949 we invented Open
Capture the Flag a while ago,
now it's been passed off to

98
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:05,000
another group who's doing a
crazy job. I work at a security
firm. I previously worked at

99
00:13:23,083 --> 00:13:29,083
other places and break shit.
Hackers are now a minority at
DEFCON. >> I'm Kristin. I'm a

100
00:13:33,708 --> 00:13:39,708
hacker first and foremost. I've
been presenting at DEFCON for
many years now. This is the

101
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:52,625
first time I've gotten up on
stage since I underwent a gender
transition about three years .

102
00:13:59,125 --> 00:14:05,125
This is slightly bizarre for me.
I hack all kinds of things.
Internet companies to cell phone

103
00:14:09,417 --> 00:14:15,417
companies to car companies. We
try not to. So yeah, Hi. >> All
right. I'm going to stand up

104
00:14:24,375 --> 00:14:30,375
otherwise you can't see me. When
we have a podium you can't see
me over my computer. I'm going

105
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:47,583
to tell you how I got here. This
is an origin story. I grew up in
a conservative religion and had

106
00:14:47,583 --> 00:14:53,583
a very well-defined gender role
and my entire future was planned
for me. And I went to my

107
00:14:55,958 --> 00:15:01,792
church's university as a premed
student. And I spent my entire
childhood doctoring up every

108
00:15:01,792 --> 00:15:08,542
child in the village. I imagined
myself in a lab coat. I was
going to do research and cure

109
00:15:08,542 --> 00:15:14,167
cancer. And my first semester at
this university, my adviser
called me in and said you

110
00:15:14,167 --> 00:15:20,792
shouldn't be in the premed
program you're a girl. I dropped
out and spent the next three or

111
00:15:20,792 --> 00:15:26,792
five years trying to figure out
what I was going to do. I took a
computer science class buzz all

112
00:15:29,333 --> 00:15:37,208
my friends were taking it. It
took me 10 to 15 years to break
the chains that were around my

113
00:15:37,208 --> 00:15:43,208
brain. When you're firmware is
slashed with something, you
don't question it for a long

114
00:15:49,417 --> 00:15:55,417
time until somebody glitches it.
And then you might start to
question. So when I broke free

115
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:04,667
and I took a couple years to
believe that I wouldn't be
punished for trying. I came to

116
00:16:04,667 --> 00:16:12,500
my first DEFCON and it was
DEFCON ten and I was scared
shitless. I didn't know a soul.

117
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:17,083
I didn't know how to do
anything. I was terrified. This
was the community that I wanted

118
00:16:17,083 --> 00:16:23,083
to be a part of. I walked in and
you guys found me, I don't know
how you -- but you did, but

119
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:34,250
suddenly I found a family I
never knew I had. Things, this
place, if you make it so, if you

120
00:16:38,458 --> 00:16:46,375
get over the fear of -- because
it's -- well it's a bit harder
for you than it was for me

121
00:16:46,375 --> 00:16:52,958
because it was much smaller
then. You will find that this is
the safest environment you will

122
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:58,958
ever be in to be who you really
are. We are not easy people to
be around. Because we won't do

123
00:17:02,625 --> 00:17:05,042
things for you. We expect that
you're going to try something
and you are going to fail at it

124
00:17:05,042 --> 00:17:11,042
a lot. And I'll get back to that
in just a second. And we will
help you but we won't do it for

125
00:17:17,667 --> 00:17:23,667
you. Whatever you are, whatever
is inside of you, we will accept
that. Because the people who

126
00:17:26,875 --> 00:17:32,875
don't, are not the people you
want the respect of anyway. My
advise to you as new bees is the

127
00:17:36,292 --> 00:17:41,375
advice that the things that I've
learned from these guys. The
things that my adviser is

128
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:47,375
constantly telling me, I want
you to fail well and I want you
to fail often. And I want you to

129
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:55,500
get up and try again. I built a
couple 3D printers and this last
one I built kicked my ass. And I

130
00:17:59,375 --> 00:18:04,125
spent an entire year taking it
apart down to the screws and
putting it back together again

131
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:08,750
because I couldn't get a decent
print. And because of who I am I
thought what the fuck is wrong

132
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:14,750
with me. Of course you blame
yourself because everybody else
is smart and they know how to do

133
00:18:17,792 --> 00:18:23,792
it. Turns out that on one of the
forms after an entire year, this
was a full year, after --

134
00:18:26,292 --> 00:18:33,125
someone said you know my nozzle
was the wrong size. I printed
something out and measured it

135
00:18:33,125 --> 00:18:38,458
and it was too big. I measured
it with calibers and my nodule
was .7-millimeters and I thought

136
00:18:38,458 --> 00:18:43,000
it was .5. One software change
solved all the problems. What I
mean by fail often is it's going

137
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:49,000
to happen because you don't know
how to do shit. But you don't
give up. You don't doubt

138
00:18:57,042 --> 00:19:03,542
yourself and you don't stop
trying. The answers will be
there and these people, here,

139
00:19:03,542 --> 00:19:09,542
have a lot of the information.
Once you try and then you ask.
And everybody will help you.

140
00:19:12,375 --> 00:19:18,375
That's what this community is
for. I'm going to pass the mic
to someone else? >> Thank you

141
00:19:21,708 --> 00:19:27,708
very much. We have about 25
minutes left. So thank you very
much. And this is something we

142
00:19:31,083 --> 00:19:34,750
specifically wanted to make sure
mouse was out there. We talked
about it at a in the pre-meeting

143
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:40,750
, we felt she had the best
representation about how we
think of DEFCON and the people

144
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:48,000
and the friends that we make
here that continue on throughout
this industry and hopefully

145
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:54,708
these are good stewards to bring
people here or take this
attitude to wherever they go? >>

146
00:19:54,708 --> 00:20:01,542
Her story is not unique. All of
us on this panel felt the same
way. This is our new family. >>

147
00:20:01,542 --> 00:20:09,542
I wanted to do something to
shake up the room a bit. First
put your hands in the air and

148
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:14,958
get the energy going. It's like
a Ted talk. The next thing I
want to do is if you do not have

149
00:20:14,958 --> 00:20:20,708
a college degree, please put
your hand up in the air if you
do not have a college degree. If

150
00:20:20,708 --> 00:20:25,917
you were qualified for the job
and they told you that you were
exactly who they were looking

151
00:20:25,917 --> 00:20:30,417
for and you still didn't get the
job because you didn't have a
degree, keep your hand up.

152
00:20:30,417 --> 00:20:35,833
Otherwise put your hand down.
Ever. If you never had a degree
 and knew exactly what you're

153
00:20:35,833 --> 00:20:43,292
doing and said you're 100
percent qualified and we really
want you to have this job, too

154
00:20:43,292 --> 00:20:49,292
bad you don't have a degree.
Look at this room here, how did
you feel about that? How did you

155
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:56,875
feel when they told you you're
100 percent qualified? There you
go. For you people, how you felt

156
00:20:56,875 --> 00:21:00,333
there, you had to think other
people that -- it's easy for us
to say it's never happened to me

157
00:21:00,333 --> 00:21:03,417
or hasn't happened around me. I
don't know if this is a real
thing. That was a real

158
00:21:03,417 --> 00:21:07,167
experience for you and how you
felt then is how other people
feel when it's, you know, you're

159
00:21:07,167 --> 00:21:11,833
a girl, you're not supposed to
be here. Or you don't fit what I
think an American should look

160
00:21:11,833 --> 00:21:16,000
like. We're not going to hire
you. Or I'm homophobic and stuff
like that. And it's still

161
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,417
prevalent everywhere. That is
how they felt. I did everything
right to be here and you said I

162
00:21:20,417 --> 00:21:24,375
did everything right except for
this degree. Imagine if you
couldn't fix it by getting a

163
00:21:24,375 --> 00:21:28,417
degree. They can't be not a
minority, be not black. You
know. I don't know how to

164
00:21:28,417 --> 00:21:33,208
articulate that but I think you
get what I'm saying here with
that example. I want to open it

165
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:39,208
up to the panel at this point
and say, do you have any good
success stories where something

166
00:22:20,958 --> 00:22:26,958
negative happened and you found
a way to turn it around
positively? >> I used to be in

167
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:34,583
administration. I didn't have a
degree and I fell into that
right after retail and

168
00:22:34,583 --> 00:22:40,583
restaurant worked and I excelled
at it. I worked my way up to
executive administration level.

169
00:22:43,583 --> 00:22:50,667
I hit a point in the career
where I wasn't making enough and
wasn't getting the respect

170
00:22:50,667 --> 00:22:57,583
enough so I put my resume out
there and got a call back.
You're amazing and wonderful. I

171
00:22:57,583 --> 00:23:03,042
know your previous job and who
you worked for and the fact that
you survived more than a month

172
00:23:03,042 --> 00:23:09,042
at that place just blew my mind.
They went through 26
administrative assistants within

173
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:17,708
one year before they hired me
and I lasted three years there.
That in itself, they're like we

174
00:23:17,708 --> 00:23:24,833
need you in our office. I said
okay, what can you offer me. So
they gave me a figure. And very

175
00:23:24,833 --> 00:23:29,625
typical what they always tell us
is you're supposed to counter
that. I countered that and said

176
00:23:29,625 --> 00:23:37,125
I would like a little more. And
she said I'm not going to do
that. Why not? Because there are

177
00:23:37,125 --> 00:23:44,958
people with degrees willing to
do it for less. And that was a
big just like choke back for me.

178
00:23:44,958 --> 00:23:50,125
And I had to swallow that. I
said let me think about that for
a night. And thankfully I was in

179
00:23:50,125 --> 00:23:55,667
a wonderful situation where I
had a husband that sat with me
that night and we sat up until 3

180
00:23:55,667 --> 00:24:00,833
in the morning and went back and
forth. I had to get out of the
office I was at but those words

181
00:24:00,833 --> 00:24:06,833
kept ringing my head. And we
looked at our finances over and
over and said go back to school.

182
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:18,750
What do you want to do? That was
an interesting point where I
said, listen, I love computers,

183
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:24,750
I like this but I don't want to
commit to that. He said what do
you like. I said I like society.

184
00:24:29,083 --> 00:24:36,458
And I like working with people.
I like the intricacy. I can get
a career in anything. It's like

185
00:24:36,458 --> 00:24:42,167
psychology but without a career
map. I don't want to help people
and fix emotions because you

186
00:24:42,167 --> 00:24:49,333
can't do that. So he looked at
me and it was like that
lightbulb went off and I'll

187
00:24:49,333 --> 00:24:56,833
never forget that moment in his
face. He is like informatics
where you use the sociology of

188
00:24:56,833 --> 00:25:02,583
people and society and then
you're using information to
really combine that. It's a big

189
00:25:02,583 --> 00:25:09,875
thing and it's like going places
now. Everyone heard over and
over, big data. And then as we

190
00:25:09,875 --> 00:25:14,583
go more and more into this and
now we're getting into the 1 or
2 o'clock hour and he's telling

191
00:25:14,583 --> 00:25:20,958
me because he is in information
security about these loopholes
and issues. And I said why isn't

192
00:25:20,958 --> 00:25:27,167
anyone layering this together?
And we looked at each other and
that lightbulb went off. I

193
00:25:27,167 --> 00:25:33,042
started looking into local
colleges and started building
that degree and found a local

194
00:25:33,042 --> 00:25:39,417
college that worked with
information security and
informatics. Had them both. So I

195
00:25:39,417 --> 00:25:46,250
started a career path of my own.
That is what I'm working in.
That was about the time that he

196
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:52,250
brought me into DEFCON. And it
blew my mind how incredibly open
and welcoming everyone is.

197
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:58,250
Interesting anecdote is one of
the first conferences that I
went to and it wasn't DEFCON but

198
00:26:00,625 --> 00:26:07,250
close to that. And I remember
sitting outside and there was a
smoking section and I ran into a

199
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:13,958
girl and she was like what do
you do. I said I'm in office
management. She said Microsoft?

200
00:26:13,958 --> 00:26:19,958
I said, no, people. And she
turned around and walked away.
It was shocking. She was a girl,

201
00:26:22,708 --> 00:26:28,708
too. That was more like -- if it
was a guy I think I would have
passed it off but it was a girl.

202
00:26:32,042 --> 00:26:37,542
And until DEFCON where I ran
into this same person again. And
we got into that exact same

203
00:26:37,542 --> 00:26:42,208
conversation. And she is like
what do you do? I hesitated. I
said I'm here as someone's

204
00:26:42,208 --> 00:26:49,750
girlfriend. She was like no. No,
you are not just someone's
girlfriend and nothing stung me

205
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:56,708
more. This person I hated for an
entire year and I resented her
became one of the biggest

206
00:26:56,708 --> 00:27:03,583
mentors of my life and that was
here at Defcon. That was turning
a very negative into a positive.

207
00:27:03,583 --> 00:27:07,792
>> What do you guys want to say
about the boilerplate? It will
be very clear once you hear the

208
00:27:07,792 --> 00:27:13,792
question. Twitter is just like
this hyperbole of complete
nonsense especially when it

209
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:23,000
comes to misandre and misogyny
acusations. What do you think?
So the loaded question is,

210
00:27:30,875 --> 00:27:35,500
because you're very active on
these conversations what do you
think we can do better or is it

211
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:40,750
something we have to turn off?
Or just start rambling after on
your thoughts about the

212
00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:48,292
situation in it's current form.
>> I start by just hitting the
fucking unfollow button when I

213
00:27:48,292 --> 00:27:56,000
don't want watch what somebody
else is saying. I don't know. My
intro to the community was

214
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:02,583
different and more hostile than
most. When I came to DEFCON
there is a lot of talk now about

215
00:28:02,583 --> 00:28:07,542
DEFCON being an openly inclusive
place. When I came it was a ton
of fucking thieves. Like an

216
00:28:07,542 --> 00:28:13,542
electronic gun conference. It
was a lot of people that liked
tech and scared a lot of other

217
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:25,333
people and that gave them power.
That scares people. Our history
is we have our blinking boxes

218
00:28:25,333 --> 00:28:32,583
out there and we want to be
engineers. So we built our own
parties and called it DEFCON.

219
00:28:32,583 --> 00:28:38,583
And now those people want to
come here, they want to look at
our tricks and buy your bugs and

220
00:28:41,958 --> 00:28:46,792
pretend like we did it to teach
them. If you have a badge and
you're here today and you don't

221
00:28:46,792 --> 00:28:51,958
hack stuff and you're here to
observe, that's great. But
understand you're a fucking

222
00:28:51,958 --> 00:28:57,958
tourist. We built this place to
be safe for us. Not radically
inclusive. Ours. And ours means

223
00:29:02,083 --> 00:29:06,458
that the thing that matters most
when you're here, not what you
look like or smell like or have

224
00:29:06,458 --> 00:29:12,458
two arms, but what you do. What
is in your head. If I hand you a
problem and I don't help you

225
00:29:14,667 --> 00:29:19,875
solve it, what do you do with
it? This is a bunch of people
that have unique approaches to

226
00:29:19,875 --> 00:29:26,042
that question. And nothing else
matters. And you're so so
contingent is just as much as

227
00:29:26,042 --> 00:29:31,292
anybody else. I'm just as free
to use racial slurs and you're
free to use racial slurs. If I

228
00:29:31,292 --> 00:29:35,167
want your bugs, I should
probably be nice to you and if
you want my bugs you should

229
00:29:35,167 --> 00:29:41,042
probably be nice to me. But you
don't have to do shit. I think
it's important that we keep that

230
00:29:41,042 --> 00:29:47,542
mantra. Because as soon as we
become the PC police and back up
for things other than our hack,

231
00:29:47,542 --> 00:29:53,417
we don't have our hacks anymore.
Thanks. We're going to start
doing some Q and A so if you

232
00:29:53,417 --> 00:29:59,250
want to line up here and have
questions, this is your live mic
to do that. While we wait for

233
00:29:59,250 --> 00:30:05,250
the people to come up and ask
questions, Kristen maybe you can
speak about if you've seen any

234
00:30:19,167 --> 00:30:25,167
changes, if any in the Black
Hat, DEFCON, tour Con, those are
the big cons here? >> The

235
00:30:32,833 --> 00:30:38,917
biggest thing that I've seen
change over the years is myself.
A few years ago when I was

236
00:30:38,917 --> 00:30:45,000
coming to DEFCON I was living a
lie essentially. I knew I was
female. I was identifying as

237
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:52,042
female and forced to live this
male persona. And I was the one
not letting me fit in at DEFCON.

238
00:30:52,042 --> 00:30:57,208
I could come and present
research and never felt a part
of the it because it was me not

239
00:30:57,208 --> 00:31:02,875
letting myself be a part of it.
So I come back this year and
these kind people are awesome

240
00:31:02,875 --> 00:31:09,750
enough to invite me on the panel
and I come and do stuff and it
feels like a family reunion.

241
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:15,750
DEFCON is a giant hacker family
reunion. I feel at home in this
place. You have no idea. And

242
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:25,333
it's been an odd realization for
me that, like the clothes and
the hair and the lifestyle

243
00:31:25,333 --> 00:31:30,292
changes that I've made, makes me
feel safe in the real world.
What makes me feel safe in

244
00:31:30,292 --> 00:31:37,833
DEFCON is this. It's the fact
that people here know I hack
things and I solve problems and

245
00:31:37,833 --> 00:31:43,833
I build technologies and that's
the only thing that matters.
This is -- it's such a welcoming

246
00:31:46,750 --> 00:31:52,750
place if you let it. But you got
to let it. >> Thank you. >>
We'll take the first ... >>

247
00:31:55,250 --> 00:32:01,250
People are going to hate but for
something no matter who you. Why
not be hated for who you are

248
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:12,250
rather than who you're not. >>
Yeah. >> We'll take the first
question. >> When I came to

249
00:32:14,833 --> 00:32:20,000
DEFCON as opposed to black hat,
these my people is where I feel
happy. I myself have changed in

250
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:25,417
the last genders in the couple
of years while working in the
industry. One of the things I

251
00:32:25,417 --> 00:32:31,125
notice is we're very tolerance
of difference but at the same
time we have these ingrained

252
00:32:31,125 --> 00:32:38,958
prejudices. So in my case people
don't care that I'm trans. I'm
seen as a woman. I have to prove

253
00:32:38,958 --> 00:32:44,958
myself. So I do and I smack them
down. >> We see you as
Australian. >> No, you're wrong.

254
00:32:58,083 --> 00:33:04,083
It's okay. >> May I respond? So
the thing is that this isn't
just DEFCON. We get that kind of

255
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:19,292
thing, I have a very recent
example with U.S. congress
people where they would not

256
00:33:19,292 --> 00:33:24,208
listen to a female voice. And
everything had to be repeated by
a male voice before they would

257
00:33:24,208 --> 00:33:30,208
listen. This is not exclusive to
DEFCON. This is a problem that
right now the only solution I

258
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:39,875
can think of is to do some
awesome hacking. Rub their
fucking noses in it. At least

259
00:33:39,875 --> 00:33:45,875
here for a lot of its history,
about 30 percent of the
speakers, the people presenting

260
00:33:50,917 --> 00:33:56,917
the cool stuff have been female.
While it may not meet your needs
and there is still no line at

261
00:33:59,625 --> 00:34:05,625
the women's bathroom which is my
metric yeah. Some things here
are better than they are in the

262
00:34:17,333 --> 00:34:23,333
real world. >> Really quickly,
we do a survey where we -- all
the conferences and all of them

263
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:33,000
generally say between 6 percent
and 12 percent women except for
DEFCON. DEFCON is between 28 and

264
00:34:37,625 --> 00:34:43,625
38 percent. The uptake of women
in information security is about
16 percent, 16, 17 percent. So

265
00:34:46,667 --> 00:34:51,708
we're double the actual industry
as far as our speaker
representation is concerned. Of

266
00:34:51,708 --> 00:34:56,333
course, everybody can quickly
look and say there is 51 percent
of women on earth so shouldn't

267
00:34:56,333 --> 00:35:01,708
there be equal representation.
That is true but it's a path
we'd like to get to. But just to

268
00:35:01,708 --> 00:35:07,708
point out we're more than pacing
at DEFCON. If you know our CTF
process you know it naturally

269
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:16,208
bubbles up that way. >> I don't
want 51 percent in here. I don't
care if your transgender, a

270
00:35:22,708 --> 00:35:28,708
woman, a man. I'm looking for a
good piece of mind. If you have
asexual, trisexual, or a neuter,

271
00:35:33,292 --> 00:35:41,125
I don't care. It's not important
to me. If you are a brilliant
mind, that's what I want to see

272
00:35:41,125 --> 00:35:47,500
here. I don't want to see 14
percent Vietnamese and 30
percent Caucasian and 15 percent

273
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:53,500
women. I want smart people here.
And get over yourselves. Get
over yourself. The only way I

274
00:36:01,042 --> 00:36:06,125
can be more handsome is if I
shave my rear end and walk on my
ends. Everywhere I go with my

275
00:36:06,125 --> 00:36:12,125
shaved head it's a hate crime.
Because I'm the big ugly white
guy. Who cares. Don't be a dick.

276
00:36:19,375 --> 00:36:25,667
Don't put hand on people you
can't put hands on. And Going
back to your original point, as

277
00:36:25,667 --> 00:36:29,375
virus said the original
community was a small tight knit
community, i've been here since

278
00:36:29,375 --> 00:36:35,750
DEFCON 5, so 17 years I watched
the kids who came to five are
now here just starting with

279
00:36:35,750 --> 00:36:41,750
their grandkids, our demographic
has expanded from that. They do
a much more diverse homogenized,

280
00:36:44,750 --> 00:36:52,333
corporatized, marketized
community. We're seeing that
bleed over into this. Just

281
00:36:52,333 --> 00:36:58,333
listening to the crap about New
Zealand. The scariest thing I
ever saw was when we played the

282
00:37:11,125 --> 00:37:14,417
University of Hawaii and they
did the Haka, I swear I thought
they were going to eat us. It

283
00:37:14,417 --> 00:37:17,083
was cool. It was great. Cause I
can do that, I'm comfortable
with that. Who cares. Let it go.

284
00:37:17,083 --> 00:37:24,250
I'm not an ugly white guy who is
an asshole. I'm me. Don't carry
it with you? >> One of the

285
00:37:24,250 --> 00:37:30,000
things that I took away with my
experience at NCWIT -- is
there's this thing called

286
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:36,000
unconscious bias. You're not
aware of what you're doing.
Because there's so many white

287
00:37:38,583 --> 00:37:44,583
men in the information security,
people, everybody, doesn't
matter what race or culture you

288
00:37:47,458 --> 00:37:53,458
are or sex, you start to be
build expectation of who fits
that model. So I'm 100 percent

289
00:37:57,708 --> 00:38:03,792
not for affirmative action. I
don't think there needs to be
percentages or quotas. But as

290
00:38:03,792 --> 00:38:10,333
individuals you need to break
that mold and not expect the
white man to be the hacker. It's

291
00:38:10,333 --> 00:38:17,292
an interesting, people aren't
aware. So if you're thinking, oh
yeah, that is not an issue. No.

292
00:38:17,292 --> 00:38:21,750
You are that issue. You have to
stop -- I've been guilty of
that. It's interesting. I think

293
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:27,750
it's -- whether it's your sex or
your skin but we are guilty, I
think by fixing those numbers

294
00:38:34,042 --> 00:38:41,458
just a little bit. It's not
about 50/50 or meeting a quota
but understanding there is no

295
00:38:41,458 --> 00:38:45,000
quota? >> It's about
opportunities. The opportunities
for someone who is interested

296
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:51,000
regardless of age or whatever.
Whatever characteristic they
feel comfortable. You've seen

297
00:38:56,042 --> 00:39:03,833
the always commercial recently.
If you haven't seen it, it's
very interesting example of

298
00:39:03,833 --> 00:39:10,208
unconscious bias. Because they
asked a bunch of small girls,
like under 7, what it means to

299
00:39:10,208 --> 00:39:16,083
run like a girl. What it means
to throw like a girl. And so the
girls race across the room and

300
00:39:16,083 --> 00:39:23,458
throw the ball as far as they
can. And then they ask the
adults what does it mean to run

301
00:39:23,458 --> 00:39:30,125
and throw like a girl and then
you get the classic stereo
types. And then they showed the

302
00:39:30,125 --> 00:39:36,375
adults what the kids said. And
the adults realized they had a
bias. Sometime between 7 and

303
00:39:36,375 --> 00:39:41,417
wherever they were they
transitioned from a girl can do
anything to a girl has to do it

304
00:39:41,417 --> 00:39:47,417
like this. I don't think it's
just related to females. >>
Question to females in the

305
00:39:54,208 --> 00:40:00,208
audience. First, this is your
first DEFCON speaking as a
female. does that mean you're

306
00:40:05,375 --> 00:40:11,375
going to take a shot? >> That
means someone has to go get
that. >> Doesn't sound like I

307
00:40:19,625 --> 00:40:25,625
can say no to that. What's your
next question? >> Well, that
depends. Technically I'm three.

308
00:40:28,958 --> 00:40:34,958
My question for all of them,
I've interviews females on
occasion, talked to them on

309
00:40:42,292 --> 00:40:47,625
occasion and asked them
questions about women in the
workplace and how I can

310
00:40:47,625 --> 00:40:54,542
contribute and make it more
comfortable. But I get responses
as far as when I ask them, they

311
00:40:54,542 --> 00:41:00,542
prefer working with men. The
typical girls are crazy, I don't
like working with them. How am I

312
00:41:03,667 --> 00:41:09,250
supposed to help if they don't
even want to work with each
other? >> That is a very good

313
00:41:09,250 --> 00:41:15,250
question. We have the same Bias.
>> If you'll notice, men, boys,
are cultured from an early age

314
00:41:22,208 --> 00:41:28,208
to work in teams, we work in
teams. We play football and
baseball and basketball. I'm not

315
00:41:30,917 --> 00:41:36,917
a psychiatrist. Girls, girls
play individual sports. They
swim, they play tennis, they're

316
00:41:40,542 --> 00:41:46,542
thought from a very early - hear
me out. They're taught to
compete with their peers. If you

317
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:06,083
think about that as a general
rule, they'll play in the dirt.
>> So there has been interesting

318
00:42:06,083 --> 00:42:12,625
research on educators where they
asked little girl -- they ask
teachers if they treat their

319
00:42:12,625 --> 00:42:19,000
girl pupils different than their
boy pupils. And this is not just
U.S., this is also been done in

320
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:24,625
Europe. And the standard answer
from the teachers is no, we
treat all the kids the same

321
00:42:24,625 --> 00:42:31,708
until they are videos. And then
they show, when they ask a
little girl a question and she

322
00:42:31,708 --> 00:42:38,292
gets it wrong, they have nice
and kind and say that's the
wrong answer. But when they ask

323
00:42:38,292 --> 00:42:44,292
the boy a question and gets it
wrong, they then work with him
to get the next answer. So if

324
00:42:47,125 --> 00:42:52,250
you think about it like this.
They coax the answer out. Girls
learn young, you get one chance

325
00:42:52,250 --> 00:42:58,250
and if you fail you don't get
another chance. Girls try to
make things perfect. I went to a

326
00:43:03,958 --> 00:43:11,417
conference recently that was
specifically for minorities in
security, an academic conference

327
00:43:11,417 --> 00:43:17,417
and it was 99 percent female.
The idea was to get a group of
young security researchers to --

328
00:43:21,042 --> 00:43:25,875
in a conference where they can
see people doing interesting
work. Not talk about gender

329
00:43:25,875 --> 00:43:32,042
insecurity but talk about
research being done regardless
of gender. They made every one

330
00:43:32,042 --> 00:43:38,042
of us talk for 2 minutes about
our research specialty. And
every woman spoke passionately,

331
00:43:41,333 --> 00:43:48,958
intelligently about whatever
they were doing. And I thought
it was so cool. And then they

332
00:43:48,958 --> 00:43:54,708
sat in the audience for the next
three days and said nothing.
Five of us had this interactive

333
00:43:54,708 --> 00:44:00,250
conversation. And we were eating
communal meals and I was going
from table to table and talked

334
00:44:00,250 --> 00:44:06,167
to people, you are doing such
and such, this person speaking
is doing such and such, why

335
00:44:06,167 --> 00:44:12,500
didn't you talk to them? I was
afraid to make a mistake. I was
afraid to say something. It's

336
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:19,167
from the cradle because the
consequences of failure are so
much harsher that is one thing

337
00:44:19,167 --> 00:44:25,167
that male mentors can do is give
the females, your females
proteges a safety net. If they

338
00:44:28,958 --> 00:44:34,958
make a mistake you don't fire
them. If they make a mistake
it's okay? >> I have a very

339
00:44:39,583 --> 00:44:43,625
quick answer directly to your
question. If someone says I
don't like working with women

340
00:44:43,625 --> 00:44:48,333
because they're crazy, whether
it's a man saying it or a woman
saying it, they're being a dick.

341
00:44:48,333 --> 00:44:54,333
>> Further to that, I noticed in
the workplace a lot of people
are often being dicks. And

342
00:45:02,375 --> 00:45:09,958
sometimes the people are present
and sometimes they're not. What
responses would you like to see

343
00:45:09,958 --> 00:45:17,667
when people are being dicks.
When these comments are made?
And if -- >> You don't say that

344
00:45:17,667 --> 00:45:24,583
at a job interview though. >>
Personally I don't always have
the courage to speak up when I

345
00:45:24,583 --> 00:45:30,667
see people being a dick. Can you
offer any advise to people in
the room about how to step

346
00:45:30,667 --> 00:45:34,958
forward or do you think that
should be something we're doing
when we see these comments being

347
00:45:34,958 --> 00:45:40,958
made? My immediate thought is I
have to think hard about that
person that you're interviewing

348
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:51,542
with. If they're asking
questions that are dick in
nature, do you want to work for

349
00:45:51,542 --> 00:45:57,292
them? >> Those questions are
illegal. They are not allowed to
ask questions about your

350
00:45:57,292 --> 00:46:03,292
marriage or your sexual life or
your personal life. What is on
your resume, that's what they

351
00:46:05,417 --> 00:46:12,958
have to go on? >> This wasn't
about interviews. It was about
workplace interactions. >> In

352
00:46:12,958 --> 00:46:19,000
the regular workplace Ive found
it very important to really sell
what you're doing and show off

353
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:23,292
your skills. Regardless of
whether you're black, white,
whatever. What you do is why

354
00:46:23,292 --> 00:46:29,292
you're there and you do it well.
>> And one school of thought, it
can be tough for a lot of

355
00:46:37,583 --> 00:46:44,375
individuals to follow along. If
you know -- and I said nothing
and then it goes on and on. That

356
00:46:44,375 --> 00:46:49,292
is a powerful quote because you
as an individual, you're like
hey, I don't know if I'm

357
00:46:49,292 --> 00:46:55,000
comfortable saying or not
saying. And by not saying it,
it's sometimes worse. That means

358
00:46:55,000 --> 00:47:00,625
I may have to look inside myself
and do something I'm not
comfortable with to speak up.

359
00:47:00,625 --> 00:47:07,333
But not speaking up can have
some dire results as well. I'm
not demanding that you do that

360
00:47:07,333 --> 00:47:14,792
but it's food for thought that
if we don't speak up, we don't
speak up? >> What if we do

361
00:47:14,792 --> 00:47:20,792
experiments. If we do, what are
the results. Try it and see what
happens. >> We're going to take

362
00:47:31,792 --> 00:47:39,333
the next question because we're
short on time. >> Quick. You
don't have to have a big

363
00:47:39,333 --> 00:47:45,333
explanation. Just say, don't be
a dick and then move on. You
don't have to say anything other

364
00:47:49,625 --> 00:47:53,833
than that. It's just being a
friend and reminding them. >>
Next question. >> In general my

365
00:47:53,833 --> 00:47:58,375
life, as a queer person is kind
of weird, and whatever you know
I would have expected given what

366
00:47:58,375 --> 00:48:02,917
I've been taught. To have had
bad experiences in general. But
no one here has given me a bad

367
00:48:02,917 --> 00:48:06,500
experience. No one has
discriminated against me. And I
feel like I don't slash our/

368
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:10,833
slash men's rights threats. But
how do I like, how do I say,
like, actually I've had positive

369
00:48:10,833 --> 00:48:14,583
experiences. I know other people
haven't and I respect that. But
there is a lot of people out

370
00:48:14,583 --> 00:48:17,875
there who have treated me very
well. And that's awesome, and I
want to give positive

371
00:48:17,875 --> 00:48:21,750
reinforcement to the people
who've been doing that while
simultaneously telling people,

372
00:48:21,750 --> 00:48:27,750
no, there is no sexism in the
world. I don't get it. I've been
very privileged. >> I only had

373
00:48:30,333 --> 00:48:37,333
one negative comment the entire
time I've been involved. >> My
girlfriend is watching on TV

374
00:48:37,333 --> 00:48:43,333
right now. Hopefully I'm not
flirting with you too much, or
just enough. >> Anyway, I wanted

375
00:48:52,375 --> 00:48:58,375
to say that as generations like
ours, we are coming into the
work force, I experience less

376
00:49:00,542 --> 00:49:06,542
bias as days go by. And in
generations like mine I'm used
to seeing people who are gay and

377
00:49:08,583 --> 00:49:15,208
transgender and hanging out with
other people. This is my normal.
When I went to school, I went to

378
00:49:15,208 --> 00:49:21,208
Purdue and they have the second
highest international rate. And
I think that we as our younger

379
00:49:30,833 --> 00:49:37,250
generations -- will be able to
deal with more diversity and
teach those who are older to

380
00:49:37,250 --> 00:49:41,625
deal with it as well and
experience it and work with it.
>> Jolly do you want to expand?

381
00:49:41,625 --> 00:49:47,250
>> I often struggle with the
same question. I had that
progress and change over my

382
00:49:47,250 --> 00:49:55,125
life. I remember me growing up,
junior high, elementary, where I
obviously stood out. I was the

383
00:49:55,125 --> 00:50:01,750
different kid and I got teased a
lot for it. If I look at my
precollege identify, it wasn't

384
00:50:01,750 --> 00:50:08,375
fun. If I look at me today and
look at my life, I think my
diversity, and my life is

385
00:50:08,375 --> 00:50:14,375
fucking awesome but -- >> And
you're Jolly. >> But exactly
this' it. I think now I get

386
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:23,708
massive benefits for being
diverse because I'm the dude in
the turban named Jolly dancing

387
00:50:23,708 --> 00:50:29,708
at a party and everyone
remembers me. I get on so many
work calls and introduce myself

388
00:50:32,458 --> 00:50:37,000
and say I'm Jolly and they know
who I am and I have no idea who
they are. >> Do you think that

389
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:42,292
is privilege, I feel like that
the people I work with, I have a
benefit because I have really

390
00:50:42,292 --> 00:50:48,292
nice tits and they enjoy looking
at them. That is some privilege
in the community. I feel like I

391
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:59,500
should check my privilege. >> I
have a lot of friends that are
-- that're white guys are

392
00:51:02,750 --> 00:51:06,792
glasses. >> I'm not saying I
won't. I will honor my
privilege. >> I honestly don't,

393
00:51:06,792 --> 00:51:12,792
it's challenging because I don't
often know how to react because
I have substantial benefits for

394
00:51:19,375 --> 00:51:27,167
who I am versus my white male
friends wearing glasses and
black T-shirts. Try finding them

395
00:51:27,167 --> 00:51:33,167
at a crowd at DEFCON. >>
Quickly, I think we need more of
those stories. It's not like ha

396
00:51:35,542 --> 00:51:42,458
ha, shame on you. I have the
upper edge. We need more
positive stories. No shame. No

397
00:51:42,458 --> 00:51:47,375
double edged sword. We need more
of this. I hear so many negative
stories and I'm done with it.

398
00:51:47,375 --> 00:51:53,042
That is exactly why I pursued
this panel. >> We're going to
move onto the next question and

399
00:51:53,042 --> 00:51:59,042
then wrap up with closing
statements. >> I mentioned to
priest earlier in response to

400
00:52:02,458 --> 00:52:08,458
the girls are competitively and
boys play football. I played
defensive tackle. I was the only

401
00:52:11,167 --> 00:52:17,167
woman in my league. I spent my
entire life invading male spaces
 being told I don't belong

402
00:52:21,583 --> 00:52:27,583
there. And I'm like, fuck you,
I'm still here. How do we
counter having to have that

403
00:52:32,125 --> 00:52:36,000
attitude because there are a lot
of brilliant minds out there who
don't necessarily have that

404
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:41,083
attitude, who don't have that
strength and there are also a
lot of organizations who are

405
00:52:41,083 --> 00:52:46,083
claiming to advocate for these
folks and doing so in a really
underhanded and back stabbing

406
00:52:46,083 --> 00:52:51,625
way. So how do we make the space
open to those people who don't
necessarily have that same

407
00:52:51,625 --> 00:52:57,708
temperament without throwing
them to the wolves of these
various organizations claiming

408
00:52:57,708 --> 00:53:03,708
to advocate for them, and will
not? I think the answer is
mentorship. Be a mentor and

409
00:53:09,958 --> 00:53:15,958
reach out to that new person in
the scene. Don't be afraid, yea,
it's only my second year of CON

410
00:53:22,583 --> 00:53:28,583
but I'll be happy to show you
around. That is where you get
that change. You're no longer

411
00:53:31,542 --> 00:53:38,958
the only girl on the team. Now
there are two of you. You proved
your point? >> Anyone here know

412
00:53:38,958 --> 00:53:44,958
this symbol? Do you know where
it comes from? There's priest
(inaudible) they can take -- one

413
00:53:52,500 --> 00:53:58,500
by one ... But they can't take
us all together. It's stand
together. >> We're wrapping up

414
00:54:14,167 --> 00:54:17,833
and everything. We're going to
make quick closing statements.
Thank you to the panel for

415
00:54:17,833 --> 00:54:25,208
taking the time. We initially
talked about going in a
different direction and these

416
00:54:25,208 --> 00:54:31,208
things have a way of being
animals and going wherever they
want to go. I hope everybody on

417
00:54:33,208 --> 00:54:39,208
stage had the opportunity to say
their piece and I hope they were
able to get through. And so, I

418
00:54:42,125 --> 00:54:48,125
thank you, everybody. And you
guys see their faces here. One
thing I wanted you to take away

419
00:54:50,125 --> 00:54:56,792
before you leave, these are
obviously people you can
approach off this panel. Come

420
00:54:56,792 --> 00:55:02,792
talk to them. They want to talk
to you. It's a positive
experience and we want to keep

421
00:55:06,625 --> 00:55:14,333
it a positive experience moving
forward. Finally, numbers,
people coming in, blew us away.

422
00:55:14,333 --> 00:55:20,333
Not official DEFCON but looking
at the demographics. This year
is the first year there are

423
00:55:26,583 --> 00:55:32,583
notable chunks in the pie chart.
This is a big year for you to
actually seek out people that

424
00:55:35,708 --> 00:55:39,667
you have something in common
with. So why not talk to
somebody, you're like hey I've

425
00:55:39,667 --> 00:55:46,083
never talked to that person
before, let's go and say hi.
It's hard for people to approach

426
00:55:46,083 --> 00:55:50,792
random strangers but this should
be a good place to do that? >>
DEFCON is that one environment

427
00:55:50,792 --> 00:55:56,833
where you can. Grab me in the
hall. I don't care. I will stop
and talk to you for a half hour

428
00:55:56,833 --> 00:56:01,083
before I realize I was supposed
to meet somebody somewhere. >>
Okay. Well thank you all very

429
00:56:01,083 --> 00:56:07,083
much and I appreciate all your
time. And we're -- a lot of us
are hanging out in the contest

430
00:56:11,708 --> 00:56:15,333
area so if you want to go over
there, that is where we
generally are. >> I would like

431
00:56:15,333 --> 00:56:23,208
to make one statement. With
current industry trends, by 2016
you're only going to have

432
00:56:23,208 --> 00:56:29,292
one-half of the industry jobs
filled. If we don't start
increasing the diversity rates

433
00:56:29,292 --> 00:56:36,583
we're going to fall. We need to
increase diversity. Encourage
people to come to DEFCON. Find

434
00:56:36,583 --> 00:56:42,583
the people who are broken. Find
the people who are put down and
help them become what we are.

435
00:56:46,208 --> 00:56:53,667
DEFCON is one of -- I haven't
felt at home like this since I
was at Jcon. It's fantastic? >>

436
00:56:53,667 --> 00:57:01,125
If you want to talk to me about
not drinking in a world full of
alcohol, come and talk to me. >>

437
00:57:01,125 --> 00:57:07,125
And also, also if anyone wants
to meet me for dinner I'm going
to the American bar grill thingy

438
00:57:13,083 --> 00:57:19,042
and I'll be standing there. Just
join me and we can talk on stats
on diversity rates and can

439
00:57:19,042 --> 00:57:24,583
answer any questions that were
not answered today. >> Perfect.
Thank you very much, everybody.
