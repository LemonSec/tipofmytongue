1
00:00:00,083 --> 00:00:06,083
 >> All right. Thanks a lot.
Yes, so I didn't know that
disobedience was going to be the

2
00:00:13,833 --> 00:00:20,708
theme when I submitted this talk
so I guess I didn't fuck it up.
Because this... 	>> Hazing. This

3
00:00:20,708 --> 00:00:27,167
is not my first talk you know.
Oh, I thought you were going to
make me drink or something. Are

4
00:00:27,167 --> 00:00:33,167
you going to get anything for
that? 	In the Penn and Teller,
yeah. Sure if it gets me some

5
00:00:38,333 --> 00:00:44,333
booze. 	All right. Disobedience
is what makes hackers who we
are. Using things in ways that

6
00:00:49,833 --> 00:00:55,000
were never intended or allowed.
Sometimes to show there's a
better way to do things you need

7
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:02,083
to break some rules and a big
way is violating unjust laws.
Civil disobedience. 	And I was

8
00:01:02,083 --> 00:01:06,083
partly inspired to give this
talk because some of the biggest
practitioners of criminal

9
00:01:06,083 --> 00:01:11,375
disobedience in this country
today are the secret police,
unrepentant career criminals

10
00:01:11,375 --> 00:01:15,750
like Michael Hayden who presided
over the Bush warrantless wire
tapping and James Clapper who

11
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:20,292
lied to congress repeatedly --
they disregard and weasel around
the law when it's convenient for

12
00:01:20,292 --> 00:01:24,792
them to do so. They are telling
us, that the end justifies the
means, so we can play that game

13
00:01:24,792 --> 00:01:30,625
too. 	We have a duty for civil
disobedience where the law is
plainly wrong and turning the

14
00:01:30,625 --> 00:01:34,708
United States into a
surveillance state in the name
of fighting terrorism, which as

15
00:01:34,708 --> 00:01:40,167
a public health problem rivals
the Bubonic plague in this
country. It is worse than

16
00:01:40,167 --> 00:01:45,000
criminal, it's stupid. So we
can't let the surveillance state
stop us from doing what's

17
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:51,000
correct. 	Remember back to the
crypt o wars, DCSS, to protect
big media from hackers playing

18
00:01:53,458 --> 00:01:59,625
their legally purchased DVDs on
their Linux laptops, DVD
encryption code was illegal.

19
00:01:59,625 --> 00:02:04,125
That's a perfect example of a
law that's worse than criminal,
it's stupid because it only

20
00:02:04,125 --> 00:02:09,708
hurts people legitimately using
media. Of course, hackers have a
duty to put a stick up the ass

21
00:02:09,708 --> 00:02:15,708
of the people responsible for
these laws. Making illegal
T-shirts, making illegal ties,

22
00:02:15,708 --> 00:02:20,292
illegal games of mine sweeper.
[Laughter.] 	Now, of course
there are more or less trivial

23
00:02:20,292 --> 00:02:26,292
injustices to be disobedient to.
On the low end, breaking some
bullshit eula, to using

24
00:02:28,625 --> 00:02:32,667
technology to resist truly
tyrannical and oppressive
regimes out there, which people

25
00:02:32,667 --> 00:02:39,208
are out on the ground doing
right now. Mortaring the man,
there is an app for that. 	The

26
00:02:39,208 --> 00:02:44,167
point is using technology to
push boundaries is what people
who come to this conference are

27
00:02:44,167 --> 00:02:48,583
supposed to do. And on the other
side of this which I will return
to in a little bit is that

28
00:02:48,583 --> 00:02:53,667
actually you have no idea
whether what you are doing is
legal or illegal in many cases.

29
00:02:53,667 --> 00:02:57,750
	None other than the
congressional research service
has stated they don't know the

30
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:03,708
precise number of federal laws
in effect in a region at a given
time. So not even a good lawyer

31
00:03:03,708 --> 00:03:08,208
knows off the top of her head
whether or not her client is
doing something illegal. Then

32
00:03:08,208 --> 00:03:12,417
take into account that laws in
this country and others are
interpreted by historical

33
00:03:12,417 --> 00:03:17,833
precedence. 	Now, it also
matters when you are accused of
doing something. Forget

34
00:03:17,833 --> 00:03:22,458
deliberate disobedience --
people break the law all the
time without knowing it so you

35
00:03:22,458 --> 00:03:26,958
have got to be careful. 	Here is
one of my favorite DEFCON
examples. This slide is only

36
00:03:26,958 --> 00:03:32,000
just an illustration, an example
of being disobedient but good.
DEF CON is full of them. I think

37
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:38,000
we can mostly agree, breaking
into people's bank accounts that
are not your own is illegal. One

38
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:44,500
of my favorite DEF CON moments
was meeting the guy who hacked
into the Nigerian scammers

39
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:48,958
back-end database, got their
bank account info and got a
little old lady's money back

40
00:03:48,958 --> 00:03:55,500
from them. I think this photo by
the way should say Goatsee
lovers. Missed opportunity.

41
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:59,250
	Leaking things is also another
disobedient act currently en
vogue and, I think, helpful to

42
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:05,000
society. A lot of what's been
leaked lately comes down to
control of the internet. People

43
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,958
with a lot more money and power,
than those of us are who are in
this room are trying to lock it

44
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:15,125
down. Disobedience is a part of
that resistance to power and
control. 	Locked down internet,

45
00:04:15,125 --> 00:04:19,667
one without the freedom to share
information regardless of one's
wealth of power or regardless of

46
00:04:19,667 --> 00:04:24,750
what that information is, is a
fucked up internet. And so, we
should refuse to be obedient to

47
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:31,875
that. 	If you are going to
deliberately disobey of course
there's just one rule and anyone

48
00:04:31,875 --> 00:04:36,542
who has been Hacker Jeopardy
knows what it is so I want a
shout out on the count of three.

49
00:04:36,542 --> 00:04:42,542
One, two, three. Thank you. 	The
other reason I was inspired to
give this talk, is because I

50
00:04:44,667 --> 00:04:50,208
have been obsessively reading
every Snowden leak that has come
out this past year. And okay,

51
00:04:50,208 --> 00:04:56,167
that's fine for me, I can feel
smug. But I wanted to contribute
some of my insights on that and

52
00:04:56,167 --> 00:05:00,042
give back to the community, and
start this -- be involved in the
discussion here on that. 	So,

53
00:05:00,042 --> 00:05:04,417
this talk is for everyone who
hasn't had the free time to go
through all of those leaks and

54
00:05:04,417 --> 00:05:08,042
really pore over all of this
stuff. If everyone in this room
knows everything that I'm going

55
00:05:08,042 --> 00:05:14,000
to say I will be really happy
but that's probably not the
case. Especially . . . People

56
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,042
don't seem to be thinking about
this stuff because people who
should know better keep fucking

57
00:05:18,042 --> 00:05:25,083
it up. 	Remember this, the good
old days back when the internet
hadn't yet transitioned to cat

58
00:05:25,083 --> 00:05:31,083
based humor. Nowadays everyone
on the internet knows you like
ascii goatsee. [Laughter.]

59
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:41,250
Google even suggests it. I'm
sorry it's not a DEF CON talk
without a goatsee. 	But

60
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:45,875
seriously the good old days were
not even that good. I'm not even
really old school. We were

61
00:05:45,875 --> 00:05:50,542
package sniffing in the 90s.
It's been a quarter century of
realizing that the trust

62
00:05:50,542 --> 00:05:55,667
assumptions that underlied the
early internet were completely
wrong and that attitude change,

63
00:05:55,667 --> 00:06:01,792
as slow as it's been has been a
good thing. You shouldn't listen
to anyone who is like back in

64
00:06:01,792 --> 00:06:06,375
the day it was better. It wasn't
that good, but it's definitely
worse now because now the

65
00:06:06,375 --> 00:06:10,917
business model of the entire
internet is stockpiling,
monitoring and tracking your

66
00:06:10,917 --> 00:06:16,917
shit. 	And the real game changer
is the storage. This is the
Bluffdale, Utah NSA data center,

67
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:24,958
your shit out there is not just
vulnerable temporarily when it's
being transmitted but it's

68
00:06:24,958 --> 00:06:29,667
stored to be mined later. 	Keith
Alexander when he came here to
DEF CON 20, he pissed me the

69
00:06:29,667 --> 00:06:35,542
fuck off, because he came here
and said "oh you guys are so
smart right? Come and work for

70
00:06:35,542 --> 00:06:40,542
me" but he thinks that we're so
smart that putting on jeans and
a T-shirt is enough to convince

71
00:06:40,542 --> 00:06:46,542
us that yeah you are a good guy
even though your agency is
preventing people like us from

72
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:56,000
becoming who we are, preventing
the next generation of hackers.
	Think about if someone walked

73
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,083
around in our community with a
tape recorder shoving it in your
face all the time recording

74
00:07:00,083 --> 00:07:05,333
everything you said, you would
find it hard to accept that
person as part of the community.

75
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:09,667
You would probably stop talking
to that person entirely but
that's what's happening. We have

76
00:07:09,667 --> 00:07:14,583
to remember that's what's
happening even though we can't
see it in our faces. Collect it

77
00:07:14,583 --> 00:07:20,750
all, exploit it all. etcetera.
	We have always assumed and
expected they were doing some of

78
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:25,417
this but thanks to our friend
Snowden we now know they were
doing what we long expected and

79
00:07:25,417 --> 00:07:30,250
more. You've got to remember the
government double speak here,
eh? When they say, we don't do

80
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:34,167
this, that means, we get our
foreign partners to do this and
then they give it to us. When

81
00:07:34,167 --> 00:07:38,875
they say we don't collect that
under this program it means yes,
we collect it under a different

82
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:44,875
program. So it's not just one
particular TLA. 	So now there's
a million ways to fuck it up,

83
00:07:46,917 --> 00:07:52,917
right. Not just in the moment
but going back in time. So if
anything you do makes you a

84
00:07:52,917 --> 00:07:57,583
person of interest they can go
back and find other interesting
stuff to pin on you. Whether

85
00:07:57,583 --> 00:08:01,625
it's a parallel construction so
they don't have to admit how
they know this stuff, or other

86
00:08:01,625 --> 00:08:08,292
reasons. 	Most of this is not
the fault of technology. Think
about problems with technology,

87
00:08:08,292 --> 00:08:12,750
it has problems. We find bugs
all the time but the number of
bugs is dwarfed by the number of

88
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:18,625
errors that exist between the
chair and the keyboard. 	So
people say they say they've got

89
00:08:18,625 --> 00:08:23,500
nothing to hide. You've heard
this a million times before.
Everyone's got plenty to hide,

90
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:28,958
right? They are the source of
many of those problems. Everyone
has always had something to hide

91
00:08:28,958 --> 00:08:34,208
even now or in the past. If
people had nothing to hide a lot
more people would post status

92
00:08:34,208 --> 00:08:41,083
messages to facialbook that say
just jerking off. For all the
people in the audience, if you

93
00:08:41,083 --> 00:08:46,250
are feeling smug because you
already do that -- [laughter.]
	You are morally consistent but

94
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:51,458
I would say you are lacking in
long-term planning skills. So
people who are trained to do

95
00:08:51,458 --> 00:08:58,625
sketchy shit and not fuck it up,
including organized crime and
the feds, two groups to which

96
00:08:58,625 --> 00:09:03,917
there is not an insignificant
overlap, you will hear terms
like trade craft and upset.

97
00:09:03,917 --> 00:09:08,708
	Trade craft means techniques
and methods and I'm going to
throw up a few things to our

98
00:09:08,708 --> 00:09:15,125
friends the CIA. I will make fun
of them later, but they spend a
lot of time thinking about ways

99
00:09:15,125 --> 00:09:19,042
they cannot fuck it up. 	The
best way to go when looking at
CIA analysis by the way is

100
00:09:19,042 --> 00:09:24,875
operations. Operations is where
they fuck it up. Analysis is
where they spend a lot of time

101
00:09:24,875 --> 00:09:27,417
thinking about this stuff. One
thing, if you go to the CIA
trade craft manual, where this

102
00:09:27,417 --> 00:09:32,833
is from, you can download and
read it. There's a big thing
about evaluating biases and

103
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:36,708
analysis. This stuff is also
really useful for operations. 	I
will just go through a couple of

104
00:09:36,708 --> 00:09:44,042
these. Perceptual biases. Seeing
what we want to see only. I
think you can think of some CIA

105
00:09:44,042 --> 00:09:51,875
examples about that. Biases in
terms of evaluating evidence. If
a consistency, small samples are

106
00:09:51,875 --> 00:09:56,208
more consistent, they contain
less information. Only relying
on available models when

107
00:09:56,208 --> 00:09:59,375
estimating probability, and
problems with causality -- for
example, attributing events to

108
00:09:59,375 --> 00:10:05,375
the fixed background context.
Sunni good Shiites bad for
example, something like that.

109
00:10:07,375 --> 00:10:12,708
	All of these things transfer
over to when we analyze our own
operations when we're doing

110
00:10:12,708 --> 00:10:17,500
something bad. There are also a
number of activities that you
can do to counteract biases.

111
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:21,083
This is where the interesting
stuff happens, this is just a
quick selection that has a good

112
00:10:21,083 --> 00:10:25,792
crossover from analysis to
operations. 	Checking key
assumptions. At the beginning of

113
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:31,292
the project or when a project
changes. Checking the quality of
information. Doing contrarion

114
00:10:31,292 --> 00:10:35,167
techniques like devil's
advocacy. High impact, low
probability and what if, how

115
00:10:35,167 --> 00:10:39,500
that happened. 	And then of
course things we're familiar
with, from pen testing. Red team

116
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:44,208
analysis, opposing force and
adversary analysis. Doing these
on your operations and looking

117
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:49,000
at where they're applicable.
	The other side of that is
OPSEC. People say that a lot in

118
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,750
this community, it stands for
operational security. It
basically means preventing

119
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:57,625
leakage of information which
could lead to discovery or
advantage by the other side.

120
00:10:57,625 --> 00:11:03,083
This World War II image sums it
up. Incidentally, on the topic
of being old school, I showed

121
00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:10,000
this picture to someone under
the age of 25 and they said why
is Gandhi the enemy? [Laughter.]

122
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:17,000
	I can't wait until all
education comes from Wikipedia
or IMDB. The government uses

123
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:22,542
your tax dollars to produce
literature to help you with
OPSEC so you need to check this

124
00:11:22,542 --> 00:11:27,750
stuff out. You need to
understand what information is
relevant. Likely threats and

125
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:33,375
vulnerabilities. Risk assessment
and applying counter measures
and the point of this poster is,

126
00:11:33,375 --> 00:11:38,375
it's tough to see the text but
you can look at it on the DEF
CON DVD that OPSEC doesn't end

127
00:11:38,375 --> 00:11:44,375
with the operation itself. It
covers all of your initial
explanation and exploration and

128
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:51,333
everything afterwards. 	What you
really want to get into your
mindset is, you don't even know

129
00:11:51,333 --> 00:11:58,750
you are going to do it and then
you forget about it afterwards.
OPSEC is a 24/7 job. 	So here,

130
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:04,417
my variant of the seven deadly
sins. The seven deadly fuckups.
What makes you a candidate for

131
00:12:04,417 --> 00:12:11,083
getting busted? Over confidence,
thinking they'll never find me.
I am using an automization tool.

132
00:12:11,083 --> 00:12:17,000
So depending on a single tool is
a point of failure. 	Excessive
trust. In surveillance states,

133
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:22,083
for example in East Germany, 1
out of 66 individuals was a
government informant. What do

134
00:12:22,083 --> 00:12:26,750
you think that ratio is like in
the hacking community? Emmanuel
Goldstein estimates one in five.

135
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:32,000
Probably that's the high bound,
but talk to Chelsea Manning for
example. I bet she's regretting

136
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:37,667
the trust model in the
community. 	Conviction that your
guilt is minor and no one is

137
00:12:37,667 --> 00:12:42,042
going to care. Oh no one's going
to care what I'm doing, I'm just
defacing a website for example.

138
00:12:42,042 --> 00:12:49,750
It's all going in your permanent
record. 	Guilt by association.
Visiting the wrong chat room,

139
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:56,375
coming to the wrong conference,
being associated with the wrong
people. Like the real estate

140
00:12:56,375 --> 00:13:04,000
people say location, location,
location. Exposing where you are
coming from is always likely to

141
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,833
fuck you up. It can expose you
to many things besides just
reverse exploitation which the

142
00:13:08,833 --> 00:13:13,750
government has been doing. 	Of
course sending anything in the
clear not just personal

143
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:19,708
identifying information but
browser fingerprints, unique
device IDs, locations you are or

144
00:13:19,708 --> 00:13:27,167
might be at in the future.
	Keeping too much documentations
about what's going on. People

145
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:31,583
who are like really fighting the
state and doing serious business
know about this. This is a quote

146
00:13:31,583 --> 00:13:36,208
from a Ukrainian separatist.
Home computers and personal cell
phones should never be used for

147
00:13:36,208 --> 00:13:40,000
operational purposes.
Identifying documents should
never be carried. Details of

148
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,333
military operations should never
be discussed on phones or in
front of family members. You may

149
00:13:44,333 --> 00:13:52,000
even need to do things that you
don't like to do like abstaining
from alcohol. 	Like sins you are

150
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,333
going to commit one of these,
you are going to fuck one of
these up. Use your trade craft

151
00:13:55,333 --> 00:14:01,375
analysis to figure out how you
can recover from making
mistakes. One of the things you

152
00:14:01,375 --> 00:14:07,333
can use to stop fucking things
up is tools. But tools can also
help you fuck it up. A computer

153
00:14:07,333 --> 00:14:12,417
is a tool that helps you fuck
things up a billion times faster
than you could do by yourself.

154
00:14:12,417 --> 00:14:16,292
	They increase confidence. The
sin of overconfidence. That is
the likelihood of fucking it up.

155
00:14:16,292 --> 00:14:20,500
Using a tool badly or stupidly
can be worse than not using it
at all. This is one of my

156
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:24,625
favorite tool injury pictures,
or tool hazard pictures because
this is from the water jet

157
00:14:24,625 --> 00:14:29,250
cutter. It puts out a stream of
compressed water at 15,000PSI --
it breaks the sound barrier, it

158
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:36,000
cuts through steel, and everyone
who walks in the room is like
what would happen if I stuck my

159
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,875
hand in that thing? 	So here's
the first tool. VPNs. You're
going to use an insecure

160
00:14:40,875 --> 00:14:46,875
network. Two questions when it
comes to tools, should I use it
and how should I use it? What do

161
00:14:46,875 --> 00:14:52,500
you get from VPN? You get some
traffic encryption but only
between you and the VPN itself

162
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:59,125
but not necessarily from the VPN
to the remote location. 	You may
get some location obfuscation to

163
00:14:59,125 --> 00:15:05,000
the remote server. They may not
know exactly where you are.
Maybe you get some request

164
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,708
concealment to the ISP, between
you and the VPN, not afterwards.
So it really depends on where

165
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:14,667
the listener is located. It's a
single hot proxy. So anyone who
is watching both ends, like a

166
00:15:14,667 --> 00:15:20,958
state agency, can do traffic
correlation very, very easily.
	It also shifts the trust model

167
00:15:20,958 --> 00:15:25,167
over to the VPN provider, a
provider you probably have a
financial relationship with.

168
00:15:25,167 --> 00:15:29,792
That could be traceable,
depending on how you are paying
for it. 	So think about those

169
00:15:29,792 --> 00:15:35,333
things. VPN providers really
vary on what they promise. Many
of them say they don't keep

170
00:15:35,333 --> 00:15:38,250
logs. You should know their
logging policy, but that doesn't
tell you the whole story,

171
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:41,958
especially if they're not
located in the United States
because they can start logging

172
00:15:41,958 --> 00:15:45,083
any time they want to -- for
example when they receive a
national security ladder which

173
00:15:45,083 --> 00:15:49,958
they have to refuse to tell you,
by law, that they have received.
So just because they don't log

174
00:15:49,958 --> 00:15:55,208
now doesn't mean they won't in
the future if you become
interesting. 	VPN clients vary

175
00:15:55,208 --> 00:15:59,125
on how well they hook you up.
They can leak informations
depending on the client. I've

176
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:04,125
seen this myself. If you plan on
hiding behind a VPN then you
better see what the client left

177
00:16:04,125 --> 00:16:08,750
you exposed. Connect to the VPN.
Run wire shock or a package
sniffer on another computer and

178
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:12,583
see what's coming out of the
computer you're going to use for
operations. Is everything going

179
00:16:12,583 --> 00:16:17,125
through the VPN or not? 	If this
small amount of thing is too
much effort for you then

180
00:16:17,125 --> 00:16:22,208
internet scoff law is probably
not the job for you. You should
work for the government instead.

181
00:16:22,208 --> 00:16:28,875
Here is a simple test for the
lazy. Open up an SSH connection
and fire up your VPN and see if

182
00:16:28,875 --> 00:16:33,708
it drops. If it stays open, then
stuff is still being leaked.
Existing connections are allowed

183
00:16:33,708 --> 00:16:38,500
to go through and all kinds of
things could be falling out with
your real IP. 	A lot of VPN

184
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:41,917
clients are also shitty for
mobile use. Every time you put
your computer to sleep or move

185
00:16:41,917 --> 00:16:49,792
around, the tunnel goes down and
you have to reconnect. When that
happens every freaking app on

186
00:16:49,792 --> 00:16:54,250
your computer phones home and
tries to immediately reconnect
before the VPN reconnects, and

187
00:16:54,250 --> 00:17:01,083
exposes your IP. 	Mail clients.
Browsers with open tabs just
like to reload them. Browsers

188
00:17:01,083 --> 00:17:05,708
that are doing all kinds of Java
script in the background, that
are communicating. All your shit

189
00:17:05,708 --> 00:17:12,792
is exposed. If this applies you
to make sure all this stuff is
shut down before you close the

190
00:17:12,792 --> 00:17:17,375
VPN. Even if it's as simple as
doing a kill all minus stop, I
know that's impossible to read

191
00:17:17,375 --> 00:17:22,208
but that's what it says, think
about everything that could
possibly phone home and stopping

192
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:26,708
it before you close the VPN, is
a good habit to get into. 	Of
course, habits are fragile, you

193
00:17:26,708 --> 00:17:31,042
will eventually fuck it up so
try to automate that process.
	Another thing on that subject,

194
00:17:31,042 --> 00:17:35,208
randomize your Mac address. It's
already been exposed that the
Canadian government was probably

195
00:17:35,208 --> 00:17:39,417
illegally tracking people using
airport WiFi from their Mac
addresses so they could see

196
00:17:39,417 --> 00:17:46,583
where people were moving around
in various airports. So I like
to randomize my Mac address as

197
00:17:46,583 --> 00:17:52,583
often as not too inconvenient.
	So, should you use a VPN? What
kind of a list does it get you

198
00:17:55,208 --> 00:18:00,208
on? VPNs have their uses and
flaws so if you are going up
against the big guys and they

199
00:18:00,208 --> 00:18:06,250
are on both sides of the VPN,
traffic correlation is trivial.
Simply using a VPN makes you

200
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:10,458
look interesting. This is the
from the Exchesco manual in
2008. Got to also remember with

201
00:18:10,458 --> 00:18:14,458
Exchesco, this is not a real
time traffic processor. This is
a database miner. It is a set of

202
00:18:14,458 --> 00:18:21,667
filters for stored data. 	People
often say to me you should be on
a list. Well I use a VPN when I

203
00:18:21,667 --> 00:18:27,500
travel especially so I'm
definitely on some sort of list.
This is from Pacific Sig-Dev in

204
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:33,667
March 2011 also mentions
ingesting and storing VPN data,
and once again identifying VPN

205
00:18:33,667 --> 00:18:37,375
use and finding out ways to get
into those networks. 	It
mentions a program called

206
00:18:37,375 --> 00:18:42,333
Birdwatch, we know nothing more
about this. But clearly some
sort of data mining program that

207
00:18:42,333 --> 00:18:47,375
could perhaps be put to use
collecting VPN key exchanges for
later encrypt analysis. 	By the

208
00:18:47,375 --> 00:18:51,417
way this is also from Pacific
Sig-Dev. I am really pleased to
see in this presentation we got

209
00:18:51,417 --> 00:18:55,292
a category of our own, right
next to terrorists, criminal
groups and foreign intelligence

210
00:18:55,292 --> 00:19:02,917
agencies, so we're in the big
time. 	Here's another NSA slide,
black pearl, a survey database

211
00:19:02,917 --> 00:19:07,792
from the taps on the undersea
fiberoptic cables, presumably
providing high level

212
00:19:07,792 --> 00:19:12,000
communication of things such as
communications having a foreign
end point because technically

213
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:17,417
they're only allowed to look at
things with a foreign endpoint.
They can collect everything, but

214
00:19:17,417 --> 00:19:24,167
it only counts as domestic data
collection if they look at it.
This is that legal weaseling.

215
00:19:24,167 --> 00:19:28,583
	So once again, using VPNS is
something that can attract
attention. This was reported as

216
00:19:28,583 --> 00:19:31,500
a tool for specifically
targeting private networks but
that doesn't seem to be the

217
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:37,500
case. So if using a VPN puts you
on a radar -- Is that a reason
not to use it? I don't think so.

218
00:19:40,167 --> 00:19:44,167
Because you might as well make
things more difficult for them
but perhaps in certain cases you

219
00:19:44,167 --> 00:19:48,750
should be aware of it when you
do your trade craft analysis.
	Here's another about

220
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:53,542
intercepting and decrypting VPN
traffic, this is the Hammerstein
slide, referring to doing a man

221
00:19:53,542 --> 00:20:00,708
in the middle attack on VPN
traffic via compromised network
route with implants inserted. So

222
00:20:00,708 --> 00:20:04,250
these refer to selected
decrypted content. 	So the good
news is, going to all this

223
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:09,250
trouble probably means it's not
all vulnerable. But at least
some of it, no doubt, refers to

224
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:16,167
crypto-attacks on PPTP VPNs.
None compromised since about
2012. Moxy, Milon Spike and

225
00:20:16,167 --> 00:20:21,000
David Holdon DEF CON 20
presentation -- And release of
cloud cracker for PPTP. 	So a

226
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:26,750
VPN is probably still worthwhile
but you have got to make sure
it's up to date. Don't just rely

227
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:32,000
on that one thing. One thing you
can do if you are truly paranoid
is hop VPNs every few minutes.

228
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,667
Some providers offer this
service within a single
provider. Again, you are

229
00:20:35,667 --> 00:20:40,333
depending on one provider. 	Now
you are generating really
interesting traffic for the NSA

230
00:20:40,333 --> 00:20:45,917
but against some listeners you
have decorrelation noise in
there. Good for research, like

231
00:20:45,917 --> 00:20:50,667
searches and port scans. Just
don't fuck it up believing this
one hop proxy is going to be a

232
00:20:50,667 --> 00:20:56,958
magical all-in-one solution. And
remember it leaves a financial
trail and that can connect to

233
00:20:56,958 --> 00:21:02,042
your real identity unless you
are paying anonymously. 	So
let's go multi-hop. Don't fuck

234
00:21:02,042 --> 00:21:07,125
it up when you use TOR.
Hopefully everyone here knows
what TOR is and the main way you

235
00:21:07,125 --> 00:21:10,958
fuck it up when you use TOR,
which is thinking that TOR
encrypts your traffic by

236
00:21:10,958 --> 00:21:15,000
default. It doesn't. TOR is for
anonymization, not for
encryption. The layers of

237
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:19,125
encryption adjust to protect the
routing within the onion. It's
not protect your base traffic.

238
00:21:19,125 --> 00:21:24,625
You need to encrypt as well.
	TOR is very, very important.
There's been talk recently about

239
00:21:24,625 --> 00:21:30,625
is TOR broken or is TOR a honey
pot developed by spooks because
they have federal funding? I

240
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,042
don't think either of those are
true but we're going to talk
about some of that now because I

241
00:21:36,042 --> 00:21:41,458
think it's really important that
we do. 	TOR is the main way
dissidents get out and

242
00:21:41,458 --> 00:21:45,625
communicate out of oppressive
regimes. It's how researchers
can look up suspicious

243
00:21:45,625 --> 00:21:49,875
information about themselves
without being targeted. It's the
way ordinary people can search

244
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:54,250
and communicate without being
tracked and monitored. And it's
how all of you do a search after

245
00:21:54,250 --> 00:22:01,500
DEF CON for catastrophic liver
damage without raising your
insurance premiums. 	So it

246
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:07,750
pisses me off with people say
that TOR is only for illegal
acts. Don't fuck it up TOR by

247
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:12,042
only using it when you are doing
sketchy shit. Pump a whole lot
of your normal traffic through

248
00:22:12,042 --> 00:22:15,917
it. Even if you completely
squeaky clean and you are not
doing anything wrong still use

249
00:22:15,917 --> 00:22:23,083
TOR because that helps out
everyone else. 	Also the nature
of TOR is for anonymity, it's

250
00:22:23,083 --> 00:22:27,042
tough to tell people that you
are using TOR for good. If you
can, if you have a use you can

251
00:22:27,042 --> 00:22:32,417
talk about get it out there.
Hash tag, tweet something like
TOR for good. The TOR devs will

252
00:22:32,417 --> 00:22:37,833
appreciate it. 	Let's talk about
people who should know better
who have fucked it up using TOR.

253
00:22:37,833 --> 00:22:42,875
We all remember this. Saboo.
Lolsec and antisec. 4chan and
nons, trolling the web, for SQL

254
00:22:42,875 --> 00:22:47,708
injection vulnerabilities,
DDOSing websites, dumping user
account databases and taking

255
00:22:47,708 --> 00:22:53,792
down high profile things that
will really get them in trouble,
like the CIA's website. They

256
00:22:53,792 --> 00:22:58,083
were coordinating IFC channels
accessed by TOR. 	The feds
discovered that, monitored the

257
00:22:58,083 --> 00:23:02,958
channels, waited for someone to
fuck it up. Saboo committed the
sin of packet origin, logs in

258
00:23:02,958 --> 00:23:09,208
just once without using TOR.
Gets owned immediately,
immediately a few seconds later

259
00:23:09,208 --> 00:23:13,500
gets turned into a snitch,
because what's he going to do,
right? He's facing decades of

260
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:18,250
federal imprisonment. 	So even
though he's been doxed months
prior at that point it's

261
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:22,333
confirmed he goes snitch. So
that's not the interesting part.
The interesting part is what

262
00:23:22,333 --> 00:23:27,375
happened to Jeremy Hammond. He
gets identified from information
in recorded chat logs with

263
00:23:27,375 --> 00:23:33,833
Saboo, the feds log that packet
meta data from his wi-fi access
point, they get a chat register,

264
00:23:33,833 --> 00:23:41,042
a regular pin register track and
trace order. Standard wire
tapping, right? They match his

265
00:23:41,042 --> 00:23:46,708
Mac address, of his computer, to
packets going to a TOR entry
node, correlate the times of TOR

266
00:23:46,708 --> 00:23:52,625
access, his TOR access on his
wi-fi access point to his
presence, his ID in the IFC

267
00:23:52,625 --> 00:23:56,250
channel. 	So traffic correlation
attack but not of the normal
kind we think of when we talk

268
00:23:56,250 --> 00:24:01,292
about TOR. So there's no
compromise necessary of TOR to
acquire the circumstantial

269
00:24:01,292 --> 00:24:06,542
evidence that eventually put
Jeremy Hammond away. 	The moral
of that story, is, don't fail

270
00:24:06,542 --> 00:24:12,375
unsafe with TOR. That is the
Saboo moral. Practice hygiene.
If it's going to matter that you

271
00:24:12,375 --> 00:24:17,375
are doing this, then don't have
two browsers open even, right,
if you accidently type something

272
00:24:17,375 --> 00:24:23,917
in that's not in TOR browser.
Make sure everything, even your
DNS goes through TOR. 	Use a

273
00:24:23,917 --> 00:24:28,208
separate machine, that's proven
to only connect through TOR,
it's a very good idea. Or if you

274
00:24:28,208 --> 00:24:32,000
want to firewall it, use a
firewall like PF sense to make
sure that all the traffic

275
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,042
through your network goes
through TOR then check what you
are exposing, go to something

276
00:24:36,042 --> 00:24:43,292
like IPcheck.info and make sure
that things are not being
exposed. 	And of course don't

277
00:24:43,292 --> 00:24:49,667
only use the TOR for operations.
Don't provide the correlation of
TOR usage with doing bad things.

278
00:24:49,667 --> 00:24:54,750
And of course OPSEC is 24/7.
This is a chat on Reddit with
Saboo after he was a snitch

279
00:24:54,750 --> 00:25:00,208
saying keep your OPSEC up 24/7.
Friends will try and take you
down you know if they have to.

280
00:25:00,208 --> 00:25:06,958
Never a truer word spoken by a
fed snitch at that time.
	Another one we've all heard

281
00:25:06,958 --> 00:25:11,958
about. Harvard student. A bomb
threat gets called in to Harvard
during exams. Takes a matter of

282
00:25:11,958 --> 00:25:16,333
hours before the perp is
uncovered as a student freaking
out about exams. Use TOR to

283
00:25:16,333 --> 00:25:22,125
connect to guerilla mail which
adds an originating IP header.
So, a lot of OPSEC fails in this

284
00:25:22,125 --> 00:25:28,583
case. Mainly the folly of only
using privacy tools when you are
up to no good. Privacy should be

285
00:25:28,583 --> 00:25:33,500
had for breakfast, lunch and
dinner. Privacy is like bacon.
It makes everything better. 	

286
00:25:39,333 --> 00:25:44,542
	So here's how he fucked it up.
Harvard's network requires you
to register your Mac address.

287
00:25:44,542 --> 00:25:48,625
Another reason why MIT is better
than Harvard, because we don't
do that. But Harvard requires

288
00:25:48,625 --> 00:25:54,792
registration tied to Mac
address, and they log the
outgoing traffic. 	These things

289
00:25:54,792 --> 00:25:59,125
provided multiple potential
vectors for this guy to fuck it
up. Again no compromise of TOR

290
00:25:59,125 --> 00:26:06,708
necessary, and this is kind of a
microcosm. At one university of
pervasive surveillance and

291
00:26:06,708 --> 00:26:12,000
pervasive correlation because
there's lots of ways that those
two things put together could

292
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,333
fuck it up for him. For example,
investigators could look at who
went and downloaded the TOR

293
00:26:16,333 --> 00:26:20,917
browser bundle right before the
bomb threat got called in. Or
look at everyone who connected

294
00:26:20,917 --> 00:26:27,250
to a known TOR entry node at
that time or who accessed the
TOR directory servers. 	So when

295
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:30,625
I think about this, I think
about what we've already got in
this country for a model of

296
00:26:30,625 --> 00:26:34,250
pervasive surveillance that
everyone's familiar with, and
that's the credit agencies,

297
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:40,375
right? And we do a kind of OPSEC
with the credit agencies. We get
credit before we expect to need

298
00:26:40,375 --> 00:26:46,625
it, to build up a rep, right.
Use privacy before you need it.
We don't cancel credit cards

299
00:26:46,625 --> 00:26:50,708
even when we don't need them
anymore because they just sit
there keeping on building up our

300
00:26:50,708 --> 00:26:57,500
reputation so don't stop using
the privacy tools when you
finish doing something bad. 	So

301
00:26:57,500 --> 00:27:02,667
just like when the credit agency
TOR usage can put you on a list.
But, you've got a good reason

302
00:27:02,667 --> 00:27:08,250
for being on that list. So,
there's a lot of ways this guy
could have not fucked it up. For

303
00:27:08,250 --> 00:27:11,667
start, He should have done, as
we said in our trade craft, key
assumptions and high impact, low

304
00:27:11,667 --> 00:27:16,792
probability analysis, being
prepared for that inevitable
interview with the cops as a TOR

305
00:27:16,792 --> 00:27:22,458
user. Or he could have used a
bridge relay to connect to TOR.
More on this later, we know the

306
00:27:22,458 --> 00:27:27,667
NSA has been tracking bridge
relays too. 	He could have been
prepared for traffic analysis on

307
00:27:27,667 --> 00:27:32,667
his entry point so if he had
gone off campus and used a
Starbucks or a burner cell phone

308
00:27:32,667 --> 00:27:38,250
with a data plan then he
probably wouldn't have got
busted. People do swattings and

309
00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:41,875
bomb threats all the time and
there aren't really resources to
track it down. You just have to

310
00:27:41,875 --> 00:27:46,542
make it hard. And of course he
could have used a mail service
that didn't IP identify and

311
00:27:46,542 --> 00:27:53,042
expose his TOR exit node. 	What
do we know about how vulnerable
ordinary TOR users are to state

312
00:27:53,042 --> 00:27:59,583
surveillance? What we do know is
TOR was troublesome enough for
NSA GSHQ that they had at least

313
00:27:59,583 --> 00:28:05,458
two anti-TOR symposia, remation
one and two, most recently
remation 2 in 2012. So probably

314
00:28:05,458 --> 00:28:08,833
there isn't a straightforward
backdoor. That's good news that
they had to have a conference on

315
00:28:08,833 --> 00:28:14,625
it. 	We do know that using TOR
is obvious. TOR is designed to
make TOR users look alike, not

316
00:28:14,625 --> 00:28:20,042
TOR users look like non-TOR
users. So fingerprinting is
already done for you. We know

317
00:28:20,042 --> 00:28:24,208
that attacking TOR seems to have
been challenging enough in 2012
that they went for a browser

318
00:28:24,208 --> 00:28:28,792
instead delivering a native
exploit to the version of
Firefox used in the TOR browser

319
00:28:28,792 --> 00:28:33,250
bundle. I think that's a good
sign too. 	This is from the
famous TOR Stinks presentation

320
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:37,250
which I am sure you have also
seen, so this is going to be
quick. We have an admission that

321
00:28:37,250 --> 00:28:43,292
de-anonymizing old TOR users all
the time is not able to be done,
so de-anonymizing is possible

322
00:28:43,292 --> 00:28:48,333
but trivial. So you have to
practice your comsec inside of
your TOR sessions. 	Of course

323
00:28:48,333 --> 00:28:51,125
they're doing traffic
correlation attacks, it doesn't
seem to be on a big scale

324
00:28:51,125 --> 00:28:57,500
though. And staining of TOR
users, either by storing cookies
or by using quantum man on the

325
00:28:57,500 --> 00:29:02,750
side attacks to force the
browser to give up identifying
like Yahoo and Google cookies,

326
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:10,583
this is one reason why using the
TOR browser is good, because it
doesn't store those cookies. And

327
00:29:10,583 --> 00:29:14,042
also quantum methods to deliver
exploits to the computer, like
the Firefox asset program. You

328
00:29:14,042 --> 00:29:19,167
can look that up. I won't talk
about it. 	So some of that
certainly should give you pause

329
00:29:19,167 --> 00:29:25,125
about how safe TOR is as a
single solution. Don't ever use
single solutions. The good news

330
00:29:25,125 --> 00:29:30,375
for regular TOR usage is that it
makes things harder. This is the
third document released at the

331
00:29:30,375 --> 00:29:36,375
same time. The system as far as
low latency and anonymity goes
is still the king. 	Similarly a

332
00:29:38,375 --> 00:29:43,500
lot of counter TOR efforts going
to client side exploitation so
tails gets a positive review

333
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:49,125
from the secret police. Adds
severe computer exploitation
misery to the equation. 	So what

334
00:29:49,125 --> 00:29:55,125
does all of this tell me? TOR
does put you on the radar and it
entails making these people's

335
00:29:57,250 --> 00:30:02,042
lives harder. That is a risk
trade-off you need to think
about. So how I think about it

336
00:30:02,042 --> 00:30:08,000
is using it puts you on a list,
a big list and if your
disobedient acts would put you

337
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:14,500
on a much smaller list, the list
of people warranting serious
attention, then it's probably

338
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:20,875
worth being on that big list as
well. The more people who are on
that big list the better it is.

339
00:30:20,875 --> 00:30:25,542
	Also security of your whole
system is still more important
in the big picture than any one

340
00:30:25,542 --> 00:30:29,542
single element. To put it
another way, there doesn't seem
to be a critical flaw in TOR

341
00:30:29,542 --> 00:30:34,125
that makes all of these other
attacks necessary. But if your
life, or your freedom, depends

342
00:30:34,125 --> 00:30:39,250
on it, don't ever trust one
single element. This include TOR
and lots of other tools in your

343
00:30:39,250 --> 00:30:45,208
communications chain. 	Do your
trade craft. One example I like
to use, I like how it says on

344
00:30:45,208 --> 00:30:49,833
crypto-cat's website you should
never trust your life or your
freedom to software. I think

345
00:30:49,833 --> 00:30:53,917
that's slightly over stating the
problem, right? We trust our
lives to software pretty much

346
00:30:53,917 --> 00:31:00,083
every day, every time we get in
a car or an airplane. But, when
you get in the car you also put

347
00:31:00,083 --> 00:31:05,292
on your seat belt. It's like the
old Islamic proverb: Trust in
Allah, but tie up your camel.

348
00:31:07,458 --> 00:31:12,333
	Here's more good news. The big
list and the small list, this is
the recently leaked filter

349
00:31:12,333 --> 00:31:17,292
rules. I know this is totally
unreadable but basically these
ones show the security agencies

350
00:31:17,292 --> 00:31:21,792
are hell bent on making that big
list as big as possible. Anyone
who connects to the TOR

351
00:31:21,792 --> 00:31:25,917
directory service, or the TOR
website, gets put on that big
list. 	In terms of the state

352
00:31:25,917 --> 00:31:30,167
admission, they're the secret
police. This is great. This is
akin to looking for a needle in

353
00:31:30,167 --> 00:31:37,125
a hey stack by piling on more
hey. Great work. This is really
good. t's upsetting that they're

354
00:31:37,125 --> 00:31:42,750
targeting everyone that uses
TOR, especially in the less than
criminal, it's stupid way but no

355
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:46,125
more so than the blanket
surveillance we're talking
about. It's just reinforcing

356
00:31:46,125 --> 00:31:50,542
that we need more people using
these services. 	This part is
worse. I mentioned collecting

357
00:31:50,542 --> 00:31:56,083
the addresses of bridge relays
by mining them out of E-mails
people send when they get a

358
00:31:56,083 --> 00:32:02,000
bridge relay. I think this is a
really scummy thing to do and
it's worth being aware that

359
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:06,500
they're doing it. So the Harvard
student may not have been caught
using a bridge relay. Maybe,

360
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:10,667
maybe not. We don't know why. We
don't know, because we don't
know how much information gets

361
00:32:10,667 --> 00:32:16,708
shared between these three
letter agencies but be careful
out there. 	Finally in terms of

362
00:32:16,708 --> 00:32:22,583
really loading up on the hey,
tails and TOR are advocated by
extremists on extremist forums.

363
00:32:22,583 --> 00:32:26,208
That is a comment from the
Eschecor rules. So
congratulations. We're all

364
00:32:26,208 --> 00:32:33,333
extreme. Have a Red Bull. 	Silk
roaders and Dread Pirate
Roberts. We all know the story.

365
00:32:33,333 --> 00:32:38,292
Silk Road operates as a TOR
hidden service. Over two years
before someone gets busted. Not

366
00:32:38,292 --> 00:32:44,708
a bad effort, in spite of some
metrics. We know that the feds
made hundreds of drug purchases

367
00:32:44,708 --> 00:32:51,583
through Silk Road, slowly
carefully doing the case they
let it operate probably for

368
00:32:51,583 --> 00:32:56,292
longer than they had to make
sure they could get a bust. This
is like standard organized crime

369
00:32:56,292 --> 00:33:02,125
stuff. 	They busted the Dread
Pirate Roberts at the same time
they image and seized the Silk

370
00:33:02,125 --> 00:33:08,125
Road server. So what fucked it
up? We know there were numerous
OPSEC fails by the Dread Pirate

371
00:33:08,125 --> 00:33:12,500
Roberts, stack exchange posts,
forum posts from the same
account including his real

372
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:19,083
E-mail. Ordering fake IDs with
his face on them, lots of things
that were likely to fuck it up

373
00:33:19,083 --> 00:33:25,458
for him. 	But we don't know how
the server was de-anonymized.
That is the 180,000 Bitcoin

374
00:33:25,458 --> 00:33:31,292
question. How did that happen?
We don't know the answer. But
here are some options. The Dread

375
00:33:31,292 --> 00:33:35,375
Pirate Roberts was already
identified and monitored.
Somehow, he pulls a Saboo. He

376
00:33:35,375 --> 00:33:41,250
logged in without TOR one time
to fix a server for example. Not
out of the realm of possibility.

377
00:33:41,250 --> 00:33:47,458
	The hosting company could have
been identified by commercial
means like the pay tracing and

378
00:33:47,458 --> 00:33:52,208
imaged all the servers on that
hosting company like what
happened with freedom hosting.

379
00:33:52,208 --> 00:33:56,375
They could have served an
exploit to the Silk Road server,
owned it and had it de-anonymize

380
00:33:56,375 --> 00:34:01,875
itself. That's what they did to
the freedom hosting customers or
they could have performed a

381
00:34:01,875 --> 00:34:07,292
large scale time intensive
hidden service de-anonymization
attack. 	We don't know the

382
00:34:07,292 --> 00:34:12,750
answers but let's talk about the
only one that involves an attack
on TOR directly. Hidden

383
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:16,333
services, what you need to know
about them is that they are at a
huge disadvantage in terms of

384
00:34:16,333 --> 00:34:19,958
correlation attacks because the
attacker can prompt them to
generate traffic. 	They are

385
00:34:19,958 --> 00:34:25,958
basically two TOR circuits
connected around a point. Anyone
that connects to TOR long-term,

386
00:34:28,042 --> 00:34:31,667
to the same thing, is vulnerable
to these kinds of things,
especially the hostile relays,

387
00:34:31,667 --> 00:34:35,542
because the network's not that
big so sooner or later you are
going to go through a malicious

388
00:34:35,542 --> 00:34:41,500
node. Not such a problem for a
typical user but if you are
maintaining a long-term repeat

389
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:47,625
business like a world wide drug
supply company then its
dangerous. 	I don't have time to

390
00:34:47,625 --> 00:34:52,250
go into details but this is a
paper released recently by
Burikov et all about

391
00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:56,458
de-anonymizing hidden services.
They were able to have a hidden
service and map the popularity

392
00:34:56,458 --> 00:35:01,625
of a number of hidden services,
including Silk Road in two days,
so this is mapping onion

393
00:35:01,625 --> 00:35:08,125
addresses and the usage of them.
Two days, and less than a
hundred dollars, and they see

394
00:35:08,125 --> 00:35:13,708
two instances. 	Also able to
confirm that a particular TOR
node acted as a guard node for

395
00:35:13,708 --> 00:35:19,042
the hidden service for the
deanonymization of that hidden
service, with 90% probability in

396
00:35:19,042 --> 00:35:24,375
8 months for 11,000 U.S.
dollars. Well within the realm
of possibility for state actors.

397
00:35:24,375 --> 00:35:28,125
This relied on a bug that has
since been fixed. A black hawk
talk this week that was

398
00:35:28,125 --> 00:35:33,417
cancelled relied on a different
bug, also since fixed. They were
able to stain TOR traffic for

399
00:35:33,417 --> 00:35:39,833
hidden services. 	This was very
irresponsible of them because
that stain is now preserved in

400
00:35:39,833 --> 00:35:45,583
all of the traffic that's being
collected by state surveillance
agencies. So if TOR's crypto is

401
00:35:45,583 --> 00:35:50,500
broken at a later date those
people could potentially be
de-anonymized. 	The good news

402
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:55,917
about it is this stuff leaves
traces. This shows a spike in
the number of guard nodes when

403
00:35:55,917 --> 00:36:01,917
Burikov and others were doing
this so it can be noticed. So
that's the good news that you

404
00:36:04,875 --> 00:36:09,208
know we can find these bugs and
fix them but be aware that yes
there are potential attacks on

405
00:36:09,208 --> 00:36:15,000
TOR but not against everyone all
the time, we think. 	About
hidden services the state actors

406
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:19,375
don't have much to say that's
not in that paper. It's the same
kind of thing. Harvesting hidden

407
00:36:19,375 --> 00:36:23,458
service addresses to see what's
out there, and then using cloud
instances of TOR relays.

408
00:36:23,458 --> 00:36:28,042
Presumably keeping up with
what's being done in the open
source community, but no reports

409
00:36:28,042 --> 00:36:34,125
of noticing these attacks on a
continuous basis. 	And let's
remember from the J-trick wiki,

410
00:36:34,125 --> 00:36:38,792
conveniently released I think
the day or day before DEF CON
flags were due so they could put

411
00:36:38,792 --> 00:36:46,292
them in here. Spooks use TOR too
quite a lot. So these were
either the British GCH people,

412
00:36:46,292 --> 00:36:49,833
using TOR for all kinds of
things. So even though they
almost certainly commit the sin

413
00:36:49,833 --> 00:36:54,000
of over confidence, among
others, they have a sense of
surety that their activity is

414
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:58,042
not going to be de-anonymized
all the time. For what that is
worth. 	Also on the subject of

415
00:36:58,042 --> 00:37:02,583
whatever that's worth,
personally even though trust
isn't transitive and it doesn't

416
00:37:02,583 --> 00:37:04,792
help anyone in this room, I know
the TOR developers personally,
some of them, and I trust them

417
00:37:04,792 --> 00:37:12,667
not to run a government honey
pot and not to make back doors
for the spooks for whatever

418
00:37:12,667 --> 00:37:18,667
that's worth. 	So the key
element to this whole thing is
not the de-anonymization of the

419
00:37:18,667 --> 00:37:22,542
service. The Silk Road service,
which is possible, the key
element is being tied to

420
00:37:22,542 --> 00:37:27,958
identity of the operation of
that service. It's theoretically
possible for the server to be

421
00:37:27,958 --> 00:37:33,625
completely identified and imaged
because it's a bi-directional
TOR circuit without Dread Pirate

422
00:37:33,625 --> 00:37:40,583
Roberts being busted. So if he
practiced COMSEC properly he
might not have been caught so

423
00:37:40,583 --> 00:37:45,000
the moral of the story is don't
run a massive online drug sales
place if you don't have a plan

424
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:50,833
for when that thing gets
infiltrated. 	There is a
meta-lesson to all that too.

425
00:37:50,833 --> 00:37:56,083
Maintaining anonymity with a
large organization over a long
period of time is really, really

426
00:37:56,083 --> 00:38:00,333
hard. You have got to do
everything perfectly and not
everyone starts out intending to

427
00:38:00,333 --> 00:38:06,750
be an international cyber
criminal master mind so they
don't take precautions ahead of

428
00:38:06,750 --> 00:38:12,667
time. So decide in advance where
things might go. Do that trade
craft analysis. 	Let's move to

429
00:38:12,667 --> 00:38:18,750
phones. What does that little
Benedict Arnold in your pocket
do to give you away? Well, so

430
00:38:18,750 --> 00:38:25,292
much freaking stuff. The meta
data of all your calls and
location information to all

431
00:38:25,292 --> 00:38:30,000
federal agencies being given to
them straight by the phone
companies. Also locations from

432
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:34,708
the data and photos you take.
They leak your contact lists,
offer lists to the wi-fi

433
00:38:34,708 --> 00:38:39,250
networks you've accessed to
anyone who is listening in that
area. 	Unique identifiers such

434
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:46,250
as IMEIs, UEIDs and so on.
Preference cookies from browsers
and so on. Sometimes the

435
00:38:46,250 --> 00:38:51,792
contents of your searches if you
do them in the clear. The older
devices have weak crypto

436
00:38:51,792 --> 00:38:57,958
especially the ones with a mixed
version base, especially
Android. 	Web browsers on these

437
00:38:57,958 --> 00:39:02,333
tiny little devices have little
ram and cache so they're
constantly reloading freaking

438
00:39:02,333 --> 00:39:06,833
tabs as fast as they can, so
everything you've done recently
when you move to a different

439
00:39:06,833 --> 00:39:12,833
network gets reexposed. 	Auto
connect. The WiFi pineapple's
best friend. Hello ATT wi-fi.

440
00:39:14,958 --> 00:39:22,250
Hello, Xfiniti WiFi, I remember
you. 	Apps of course. Leaking
all kinds of shit. It all adds

441
00:39:22,250 --> 00:39:28,833
up to a unique identifier of you
and a patent of your life and
the agencies monitor this kind

442
00:39:28,833 --> 00:39:33,917
of stuff constantly, especially
looking for concurrent presence
and the on-off patterns of your

443
00:39:33,917 --> 00:39:39,750
phones. 	I'm kind famous for not
carrying a cell phone because I
don't like publicly associating

444
00:39:39,750 --> 00:39:44,708
myself with criminal
organizations by which I mean of
course the phone companies. But

445
00:39:44,708 --> 00:39:49,917
there is one time of year I
carry a phone, it is this little
seven year old Nokia feature

446
00:39:49,917 --> 00:39:55,500
phone and it must look great in
the meta data store, because
every time this phone is used,

447
00:39:55,500 --> 00:40:01,375
it's constantly surrounded by
thousands of notorious hackers.
	But for the secret police,

448
00:40:01,375 --> 00:40:06,833
smart phones are the best gift
they could ever get. It's like
Christmas, Hanukkah, and Steak

449
00:40:06,833 --> 00:40:14,792
and Blowjob Day all rolled up
into one big spy orgasm. Their
perfect scenario is just a very

450
00:40:14,792 --> 00:40:19,250
simple thing. A simple photo
share that happens millions of
times a day, they get everything

451
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:26,042
I just mentioned and more. They
know this, and yet even the spy
agencies manage to fuck it up.

452
00:40:26,042 --> 00:40:32,250
	Here we go with the CIA.
February 2003 rendition of
Egyptan cleric Abu Omar from

453
00:40:32,250 --> 00:40:39,542
Italy. The police were able to
reconstruct a minute by minute
rundown of that abduction from

454
00:40:39,542 --> 00:40:44,750
the cell phone records. 	25 CIA
employees and one United States
Air Force lieutenant colonel

455
00:40:44,750 --> 00:40:48,333
were named and charged by the
Italian authorities for pulling
this guy off of the street and

456
00:40:48,333 --> 00:40:53,708
illegally abducting him and
spiriting him out of the
country. They did this because

457
00:40:53,708 --> 00:41:00,250
the phones were geo-located near
the abduction at the time. They
found the numbers had called one

458
00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:05,167
another and even family members
in the U.S. They never removed
their phone batteries. They

459
00:41:05,167 --> 00:41:08,833
geo-located the phones to the
hotels at night, checked the
phones against registration

460
00:41:08,833 --> 00:41:13,833
records, many used their own
names, and some made sure their
hotel stays were registered to

461
00:41:13,833 --> 00:41:21,458
their frequent flyer numbers so
they got the miles. 	So if you
are going to use a burner phone

462
00:41:21,458 --> 00:41:28,583
under this kind of capacity to
massively correlate every phone
that's in use all the time, then

463
00:41:28,583 --> 00:41:32,000
you need to know what to do to
not to fuck it up. In fact if
you are carrying a personal

464
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,875
tracker device, AKA a cell phone
you've probably already fucked
it up. 	Here's what you have got

465
00:41:35,875 --> 00:41:42,125
to do to use a burner phone.
Agencies specifically look at
traffic to identify burners,

466
00:41:42,125 --> 00:41:46,083
looking at things like length of
time from activation to when
they go away and are never used

467
00:41:46,083 --> 00:41:51,625
again. 	Patterns of use. Try to
identify burner cycling, if they
get used again. Fingerprinting

468
00:41:51,625 --> 00:41:57,458
of phones. EFF is suing the NSA
about this right now. They log
signal strengths at cell towers

469
00:41:57,458 --> 00:42:03,458
to get your location every time
the phone is turned on and used
as a record and the number used

470
00:42:03,458 --> 00:42:07,458
to activate the phone or SIM is
also recorded. And also the
purchases. They'll go back to

471
00:42:07,458 --> 00:42:11,542
security video in the WalMart
where you got it from. 	So
here's what you want to do if

472
00:42:11,542 --> 00:42:16,000
you want to use a burner phone
securely. Purchase them a long
time in advance, before the

473
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:22,542
operation. Register them far
away from the operation's area.
Use false information when you

474
00:42:22,542 --> 00:42:27,583
register them. Go with dumb or
feature phones instead of
smartphones. 	Remove the battery

475
00:42:27,583 --> 00:42:32,417
when you aren't using it. Fill
the phone with fake contacts.
Use each one as little as

476
00:42:32,417 --> 00:42:37,542
possible and switch phones when
you switch locations and leave
the phone at that location so

477
00:42:37,542 --> 00:42:42,750
you don't fuck it up. 	Call
unrelated numbers so there's a
different pattern of network per

478
00:42:42,750 --> 00:42:49,125
phone and remember the purpose
for each phone and finally
destroy it when you are finished

479
00:42:49,125 --> 00:42:53,583
or, you can do what McAfee does,
which is tape it to the bottom
of a long distance 18 wheeler

480
00:42:53,583 --> 00:42:57,208
and let it go for a ride. I'm
not saying that's the best thing
to do it because eventually

481
00:42:57,208 --> 00:43:04,333
someone will find it and do
forensics on it but think about
that. 	Don't ever turn a phone

482
00:43:04,333 --> 00:43:08,917
on in a location that you can be
placed at. Allow your phone to
be on at the same time or placed

483
00:43:08,917 --> 00:43:15,250
with another phone that you own.
Call the same non-burner phone
from multiple burners. Store any

484
00:43:15,250 --> 00:43:19,625
real contacts on that phone.
Matching entry and exit point.
We know specifically that they

485
00:43:19,625 --> 00:43:25,542
work for that so don't match the
last use and first use of
phones. 	Overlap it. Don't tie

486
00:43:25,542 --> 00:43:29,458
them to online services that can
bridge that meta data for
example Gmail accounts. Think

487
00:43:29,458 --> 00:43:36,750
what you would do to red team a
massive database of location,
time, call destination, call

488
00:43:36,750 --> 00:43:42,625
link meta data. Anonymity is
hard. If you can't go to the
trouble to not fuck it up then

489
00:43:42,625 --> 00:43:49,250
evaluate whether the risk you
are taking is worth it.
	Messaging. After all of these

490
00:43:49,250 --> 00:43:54,958
years E-mail still fucking
sucks. Fighting spam aids
tracking, because that's why

491
00:43:54,958 --> 00:44:00,208
they insert sender IPs and other
information into the headers.
After all these years of the

492
00:44:00,208 --> 00:44:06,125
wall of sheep, let's give it up
for the wall of sheep because
they're awesome. After all these

493
00:44:06,125 --> 00:44:12,125
years of the wall of sheep, Web
mail service is still going to
HTTP and not forcing HTTPS. So

494
00:44:14,333 --> 00:44:20,417
the accurate more accurate
sheep-related analogy is this, a
sheep filled with God damn

495
00:44:20,417 --> 00:44:28,042
worms. 	Mail services, even if
they implement SSL, they have
weak service-side storage.

496
00:44:28,042 --> 00:44:32,792
Remember the GCHQ slide with
that infamous smiley face. They
may not encrypt on their

497
00:44:32,792 --> 00:44:39,542
internal networks. E-mail is
still fundamentally broken
because even if you use PGP or S

498
00:44:39,542 --> 00:44:46,208
mine the meta data is still not
encrypted and the meta data can
still fuck you up. 	This is a

499
00:44:46,208 --> 00:44:51,208
huge one. People keep their
E-mail. It's logged insecurely
on the client side - either in

500
00:44:51,208 --> 00:44:55,958
browser caches and so where it
can be exposed, or people just
having bad retention habits and

501
00:44:55,958 --> 00:45:00,500
saving all their email. Like
someone famously said, "It
doesn't matter that I don't use

502
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:05,958
Gmail because Google has my mail
because all my friends do."
	Remember that. Google is part

503
00:45:05,958 --> 00:45:11,458
of the problem. They never
delete their mail, that thing.
	Instant Messaging is not much

504
00:45:11,458 --> 00:45:16,542
better. Remember the psycho
example principle. Never say
anything, never put anything in

505
00:45:16,542 --> 00:45:21,750
a message packet that a psycho
ex could use credibly against
you later. Assume everything is

506
00:45:21,750 --> 00:45:26,500
being saved forever especially
by the NSA, if it's encrypted.
Their retention rules allow them

507
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:32,750
to keep it for forever if it's
encrypted. 	We all like to make
fun of security by obscurity.

508
00:45:32,750 --> 00:45:36,750
But sometimes, that's all we
have. These are the code talkers
in World War II, a classy

509
00:45:36,750 --> 00:45:43,208
example of security by obscurity
that worked. At its best, it's
fully deniable. It's arguably

510
00:45:43,208 --> 00:45:46,542
the safest communication,
because either no one even knows
it's a communication, but if you

511
00:45:46,542 --> 00:45:52,333
are going to use it, security by
obscurity, make sure you don't
fuck it up. 	Here's another CIA

512
00:45:52,333 --> 00:45:58,208
example. General Petreus,
picking on these guys going all
the way to the top -- he's

513
00:45:58,208 --> 00:46:03,417
having an affair with his
biographer. They write messages
in draft emails and don't send

514
00:46:03,417 --> 00:46:07,667
them, they just delete them when
they're read. Multiple people
have access to the account. In

515
00:46:07,667 --> 00:46:12,667
spy terminology, that's really
casting email as a dead drop
instead of a transit mechanism.

516
00:46:12,667 --> 00:46:18,958
	Now, I would never begrudge
anyone a booty call but if you
are going to fuck don't fuck it

517
00:46:18,958 --> 00:46:26,583
up. They used the exact
technique developed by people
the CIA was already monitoring.

518
00:46:26,583 --> 00:46:32,583
Quote unquite, Al-Quaeda people
in the Middle East somewhere.
Using multiple accesses to a

519
00:46:34,625 --> 00:46:38,917
single E-mail address from
different locations, that's
exactly what pervasive

520
00:46:38,917 --> 00:46:44,667
surveillance was designed to
expose. Anyone in the room if
given the database and told,

521
00:46:44,667 --> 00:46:48,708
write me some interesting
queries, one of the first things
you would do is say, give me all

522
00:46:48,708 --> 00:46:53,125
the accesses to the E-mail
accounts that are impossible
journeys, that are in times you

523
00:46:53,125 --> 00:46:59,083
could physically not make that
location transit. 	Secondly
don't rely on things getting

524
00:46:59,083 --> 00:47:05,125
deleted. If Google knows about
it it's no longer safe. It's
cheaper to keep things than

525
00:47:05,125 --> 00:47:11,833
delete these days. So be
judicious about your insecurity.
Understand your insecure

526
00:47:11,833 --> 00:47:15,583
channels. It's okay to use them
but manage them. Do your quality
information check and your

527
00:47:15,583 --> 00:47:21,583
what-if analysis. You should
understand by now in this talk
that Petraeus could have covered

528
00:47:21,583 --> 00:47:26,417
his tracks even if it looked
plain for all to see that two
people were having an affair, as

529
00:47:26,417 --> 00:47:31,042
long as it couldn't be tied back
to him. 	This happens millions
of times a day, hiding the

530
00:47:31,042 --> 00:47:38,083
noise. 	So here are some common
services. Commercial web mail is
all fucked. I advise people to

531
00:47:38,083 --> 00:47:44,625
run their own mail server. At
least when the feds are
interested you will know about

532
00:47:44,625 --> 00:47:48,542
it. Meta data is still a bitch
though, it gives it all away.
This is an image of the mail

533
00:47:48,542 --> 00:47:53,083
that Lee Harvey Oswald sent to
the Kremlin. That's what meta
data is. Hopefully darkmail will

534
00:47:53,083 --> 00:47:59,083
do something about this, I
didn't go to that talk, I'm
going to watch it later.

535
00:48:01,208 --> 00:48:07,125
Hopefully it was good. 	Skype.
Definitely compromised. No
question. This is an enabling

536
00:48:07,125 --> 00:48:12,625
document referring to back door
and commercial service
providers. By 2013 full access

537
00:48:12,625 --> 00:48:17,250
to a major internet peer to peer
voice and text communication
system. What do you suppose that

538
00:48:17,250 --> 00:48:23,583
is? Too speculative? 	NSA
briefing notes by the director
of German intelligence on the

539
00:48:23,583 --> 00:48:28,083
potential land mines, a
carefully passed statement
saying that the official line,

540
00:48:28,083 --> 00:48:32,625
is that Skype is owned by
tailored access at the end
points, meaning compromising one

541
00:48:32,625 --> 00:48:36,542
or more of the communicating
party's computers. Not in
transit, but a clear implication

542
00:48:36,542 --> 00:48:39,917
from the language that they've
done a deal with Skype they
didn't want to tell the Germans

543
00:48:39,917 --> 00:48:44,583
about, even though they are
allies. And if that doesn't
convince you, JTrig's Wiki

544
00:48:44,583 --> 00:48:49,125
spells it out -- realtime
records. Bi-directional instant
messages and contact lists.

545
00:48:49,125 --> 00:48:56,167
Pwnd. 	So fuck Skype. I mean you
can still use it if you want to
but understand that people with

546
00:48:56,167 --> 00:48:59,792
the right capabilities, it's
equivalent to unencrypted. So
figure out your threat model.

547
00:49:02,792 --> 00:49:07,042
	Lots of chat I think is broken
if we're including the secret
police in our threat model. So I

548
00:49:07,042 --> 00:49:11,875
say, let's assume jt IFC is
pretty much all collected -- if
you can grab all of port 80 then

549
00:49:11,875 --> 00:49:17,875
why not grab 6667 for an
afterthought, even. If you are
using SSL from you to the IFC

550
00:49:19,917 --> 00:49:26,500
chat room even one single person
in the group chat unencrypted
means that is all completely

551
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:32,667
ownable by the massive
surveillance. 	We know that IFC
is on the radar because of

552
00:49:32,667 --> 00:49:39,292
quantum bot, taking control of
IFC bots. Over 140,000 bots
taken control of and coopted.

553
00:49:39,292 --> 00:49:44,667
Lots of reasons the spooks might
be interested in IFC bots.
Persistent presence all over IFC

554
00:49:44,667 --> 00:49:50,792
is just one of them. Something
to be aware of. 	Remember things
when Google promises off the

555
00:49:50,792 --> 00:49:58,125
record, all it means they don't
keep it. It's not true OTR. Also
remember Quinn Norton's great

556
00:49:58,125 --> 00:50:03,583
essay Everything is Broken. Some
OTR implementations don't
encrypt that first message. She

557
00:50:03,583 --> 00:50:08,375
has tales of people fucking it
up because of the that. Don't
let your story be one of them.

558
00:50:08,375 --> 00:50:13,292
	So what can we use? What might
not be completely fucked? Some
OTR implementations, some people

559
00:50:13,292 --> 00:50:17,583
like Quinn have bad things to
say about loop purple, but it's
everywhere. Crypto cat I think

560
00:50:17,583 --> 00:50:21,750
after some initial security
fails really did the right
thing. They opened it up to

561
00:50:21,750 --> 00:50:26,208
community peer review and
security auditing. They really
want to make a good product. 	I

562
00:50:26,208 --> 00:50:31,500
have been using bit message a
lot lately. Every so often it
goes berserk and runs my

563
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:38,000
processes at 100% but it seems
to be decent as long as you can
connect with it regularly

564
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:42,375
because it throws messages after
two days because of security
performance problems, so it's

565
00:50:42,375 --> 00:50:46,667
not good for intermittent usage.
	I haven't played with retro
share much but I like what I've

566
00:50:46,667 --> 00:50:51,208
seen. I like the peer to peer
structure and the key
management. It seems like a good

567
00:50:51,208 --> 00:50:55,875
direction to go in but it sums
up that we really need more
auditing. We need more peer

568
00:50:55,875 --> 00:51:01,083
reviews so we can see what we
can really trust, and it also
suffers from the floor of

569
00:51:01,083 --> 00:51:05,000
standing out of as we need
encrypted communications, so we
need steganography. 	I'm about

570
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:10,208
to be dragged off the stage. I
have two things to say. Number
one, we say there's a lot of

571
00:51:10,208 --> 00:51:14,250
suspicion of glass holes,
because they might be recording
us. Well guess what? Everyone is

572
00:51:14,250 --> 00:51:18,625
fucking recording shit. Everyone
is keeping E-mail and their IMs
for so long and not deleting

573
00:51:18,625 --> 00:51:23,250
them - we need ephemeral
messaging that's not just in the
smartphone app space. We need

574
00:51:23,250 --> 00:51:29,250
more steganography. We need, all
right I'm getting there. 	One
thing. GCHQ. They had to take

575
00:51:31,917 --> 00:51:37,000
people, use special staff to
view the chat video they were
illegally collecting, because of

576
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:42,333
all the nudity, so send plenty
of nudity. Make it the bad --
Ugh one more thing. 	So the One

577
00:51:42,333 --> 00:51:48,333
thing I just had up, a friend of
mine wrote this and it mixes cat
pictures with things that look

578
00:51:51,708 --> 00:51:57,708
encrypted - things that look
like security documents. So you
can swap cat pictures for porn.

579
00:52:00,875 --> 00:52:08,417
One last thing I want to say to
the people in the audience, to
the haxors, lose the ego. Follow

580
00:52:08,417 --> 00:52:12,250
those burner rules for your
identities. Keep your real in
real life identity real and

581
00:52:12,250 --> 00:52:18,500
separate from the ones you do
bad things with right? 	People
come to conferences like DEF CON

582
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:23,292
to get cred but cred is your
enemy. Don't talk about the shit
that you are doing. This is

583
00:52:23,292 --> 00:52:27,042
where the criminal complaint
against Jeremy Hammond, this is
where Saboo goes to great

584
00:52:27,042 --> 00:52:30,583
trouble to connect all of Jeremy
Hammond's identities together so
they can put the criminal

585
00:52:30,583 --> 00:52:37,417
complaint together. 	Finally
support the EFF. Ask for things.
Good luck. It's better to be

586
00:52:37,417 --> 00:52:45,208
lucky than smart sometimes and
never surrender to obedience.
Thank you. 	[Applause] 	>> All

587
00:52:45,208 --> 00:52:48,083
right so if anyone wants to talk
to him we're going to be out
here in the hallway. If you are

588
00:52:48,083 --> 00:52:50,583
staying please move your stuff.
There are shit loads of people
outside who all want to come in.
