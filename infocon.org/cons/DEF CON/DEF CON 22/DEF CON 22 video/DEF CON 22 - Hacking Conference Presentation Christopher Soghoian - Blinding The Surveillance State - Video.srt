1
00:00:00,458 --> 00:00:06,458
I'm Chris Soghoian, I work for
the ACLU. Yeah. I feel you! I've
been thinking about this talk

2
00:00:12,792 --> 00:00:20,250
for a while. Many of us have
been trying to convince people
and companies to encrypt their

3
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:26,792
communications for a while. And
the last few weeks and few years
have been a really good time.

4
00:00:26,792 --> 00:00:30,667
There has been a lot of positive
movement in the right direction
and I'll talk about that today.

5
00:00:30,667 --> 00:00:36,667
But I want to get us all the way
there. I really want to talk
today about how we start to get

6
00:00:39,333 --> 00:00:46,958
default encryption for
everything and how we really
start to do damage. As a

7
00:00:46,958 --> 00:00:54,542
reminder, I work for the ACLU,
the American civil liberties
union. Last summer when I came

8
00:00:54,542 --> 00:01:00,542
and gave a talk, we have a table
in the vendor area where you can
get T-shirts like this and

9
00:01:03,417 --> 00:01:11,167
someone came up and said why
aren't you going anything for Ed
Snowden. Why aren't you helping

10
00:01:11,167 --> 00:01:17,167
him? My boss, Ben, who is a
Snowden employer smiled and
couldn't say what was happening.

11
00:01:23,958 --> 00:01:29,958
We've been helping Ed for some
time. And I don't think it's
overestimating to say -- just to

12
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:38,375
say really we wouldn't be where
we are now were it not for his
disclosures and bravery. The

13
00:01:38,375 --> 00:01:44,708
amount of changes in the debate
and the pressure on companies to
encrypt is staggering. He

14
00:01:44,708 --> 00:01:52,125
couldn't be here. We don't have
the Snowden 5,000 walking around
the halls at DEFCON but we have

15
00:01:52,125 --> 00:01:58,583
it in New York. And Snowden made
this a lot easier. This woman is
Diane Planstin you can boo her

16
00:01:58,583 --> 00:02:04,583
if you like. Only at DEFCON. So
she is the chairwoman of the
senate intelligence committee.

17
00:02:16,208 --> 00:02:21,792
I'm going to read you a quick
quote of hers from last year.
This is after the first few

18
00:02:21,792 --> 00:02:26,875
Snowden story broke, as the
administration and the defenders
of these surveillance community

19
00:02:26,875 --> 00:02:33,625
really started to go on the
attack and defend everyone's
communication this is what she

20
00:02:33,625 --> 00:02:40,667
said, it's necessary for the NSA
to obtain the haystack of
records in order to find the

21
00:02:40,667 --> 00:02:47,750
terrorist needle. They need to
do bulk surveillance, not
because they care about our

22
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:54,292
communication but because they
care about the bad guys. There
is a problem with this analogy

23
00:02:54,292 --> 00:03:01,792
and this drives the talk today
and drives a lot of the work I'm
doing. We are the haystack. We

24
00:03:01,792 --> 00:03:05,167
have the hay stake whose
communications are being
monitored and it's not right. We

25
00:03:05,167 --> 00:03:07,167
can fight in the courts which
the ACLU is doing. and other
organizations are doing, We can

26
00:03:07,167 --> 00:03:13,167
fight in congress which the ACLU
and other organizations are
doing. And we can also fight

27
00:03:15,292 --> 00:03:20,292
through technology and make it
more difficult for bulk
surveillance to take place.

28
00:03:22,667 --> 00:03:27,458
thats what this talk is about
today, How do we use math and
technology to prevent them from

29
00:03:27,458 --> 00:03:33,458
collecting the whole haystack. 
Going back in time to 2009. A
long time ago in a galaxy far

30
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:42,500
far away. If you cared about
encryption on the web, 2009 was
a really bad time. Things

31
00:03:46,375 --> 00:03:52,458
weren't good. With the exception
of some banking websites that
you used, most of your

32
00:03:52,458 --> 00:03:57,792
communications over the web were
not protected with basic
encryption built into all web

33
00:03:57,792 --> 00:04:01,292
browsers. Even your
authentication could be easy for
someone to steal your

34
00:04:01,292 --> 00:04:07,292
information. In 2009 all the big
cloud computing companies and
social networking sites and

35
00:04:12,875 --> 00:04:18,875
email providers none used SSL by
default. Everyone was vulnerable
to surveillance. Not just by

36
00:04:21,333 --> 00:04:27,042
individuals but by the state.
There is a slide that I haven't
included in here from GC-HQ

37
00:04:27,042 --> 00:04:33,042
slide deck 2009 in which they're
cheering and patting themselves
on the back because so many

38
00:04:36,958 --> 00:04:40,625
services are not encrypted.
Without SSL, surveillance was a
question of how to do the tap

39
00:04:40,625 --> 00:04:47,250
and how to process the data
rather than how to break any
technology or security. This is

40
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:53,292
a blog post from Google in 2009.
When they first announced the
availability of an option, a

41
00:04:53,292 --> 00:04:58,125
configuration setting to force
SSL in the future. This was an
option that wasn't turned on by

42
00:04:58,125 --> 00:05:04,125
default. You had to go in and
set it. SSL can make your mail
slower, your computer has to do

43
00:05:06,167 --> 00:05:10,833
extra work to decrypt that data.
And encrypted data doesn't
travel across the internet as

44
00:05:10,833 --> 00:05:18,292
efficiently as unencrypted data
and that's why we leave the
choice up to you. this was a

45
00:05:18,292 --> 00:05:24,125
false choice because this was an
option that was hidden from most
people. If you clicked into the

46
00:05:24,125 --> 00:05:30,125
advanced settings in G mail it
said use HTTPS question mark.
Nothing to indicate that this

47
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:39,083
was important. It was the 13th
of 13 configuration option after
the vacation auto away message,

48
00:05:39,083 --> 00:05:42,750
after unicode settings. Most
people don't know what unicode
is. The user interface of G mail

49
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:44,750
screamed to users this isn't
important. It doesn't matter. So
say this is a choice for the

50
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:50,750
user, it's false. What you're
doing then is allowing a system
to ship in an unsecure manner

51
00:05:57,625 --> 00:06:03,917
and blaming the user for not
seeking out the option and
enable it themselves. That was

52
00:06:03,917 --> 00:06:09,917
Google in 2009. That meant that
for the people that work in this
building or at NSA, life was

53
00:06:12,958 --> 00:06:18,708
good. Bulk surveillance is easy
in a world where everything is
going over the network without

54
00:06:18,708 --> 00:06:24,708
any protection. For the NSA in
2009, the internet was an all
you can eat buffet. We know what

55
00:06:26,917 --> 00:06:32,917
happens when a society is
dominated by all you can eat
buffets. The NSA gorged

56
00:06:35,583 --> 00:06:40,292
themselves. They gorged
themselves until they got sick,
actually until one person got

57
00:06:40,292 --> 00:06:48,167
sick and blew the whistle. Now
it's time to put the NSA on a
diet. Sorry for the analogies

58
00:06:48,167 --> 00:06:54,958
but they make sense. We need to
starve the NSA of the data
they've come to depend on. That

59
00:06:54,958 --> 00:07:00,958
is because of people like Ed
Snowden that we now have an
understanding of what is taking

60
00:07:03,667 --> 00:07:08,167
place and how they're collecting
information which means we have
an understanding of what we can

61
00:07:08,167 --> 00:07:13,333
do to stop them. In the last
year there's been a number of
disclosures about bulk

62
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:20,083
surveillance targeting internet
communications. And these it's
fair to say, set the internet on

63
00:07:20,083 --> 00:07:26,083
fire. The first slide that
galvanized the tech community is
this slide that says the NSA is

64
00:07:28,292 --> 00:07:34,042
monitoring the links between
Google's data centers-- Google
believed -- after 2010 Google

65
00:07:34,042 --> 00:07:40,042
turned on SSL. Google believed
they needed to encrypt the links
between the user and the

66
00:07:43,917 --> 00:07:50,417
servers. google thought that the
privately slime cables that they
were renting from companies like

67
00:07:50,417 --> 00:07:55,417
level 3 could never be tapped so
even though they had data
centers in other countries they

68
00:07:55,417 --> 00:08:01,208
didn't feel they needed to
protect the links. Google is
wrong. The NSA and their GCHU

69
00:08:01,208 --> 00:08:07,208
partner tunneled into the
private network and got
information that wouldn't have

70
00:08:09,833 --> 00:08:15,833
left the internet otherwise. The
Washington Post revealed that
the NSA has been monitoring the

71
00:08:23,208 --> 00:08:28,208
address books of many popular
communication services, Yahoo,
Google, Facebook. The NSA is

72
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:34,250
interested in instant messenger
lists. They show communications
and patterns and who you're

73
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:40,750
interested in talking to. On
this slide the thing that is the
most interesting and damning for

74
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:46,750
the tech companies is the news
that Yahoo users are being
targeted by the NSA in the order

75
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:54,958
of magnitude and more time than
Gmail or Facebook. Why were
Yahoo users having their address

76
00:08:57,458 --> 00:09:00,625
books collected an order of
magnitude more? Because they
weren't using SSL. The fact that

77
00:09:00,625 --> 00:09:07,583
Yahoo is using it now is
directly as a result of the
Snowden. We've seen the tech

78
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:13,583
companies beef up security.
Companies embracing SSL. weve
seen them tightening their

79
00:09:20,917 --> 00:09:27,500
choice of encryption algorithm.
The adoption of perfect forward
secrecy of HST browser headers.

80
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:31,500
making sure that you always go
back to the secure version of
the website. you never go to

81
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:37,500
port 80 We've seen instant
message platforms all migrate to
user, to server encrypted links.

82
00:09:40,375 --> 00:09:46,667
We just saw yesterday, Yahoo
announced they -- by 2015 will
be offering encrypted e-mail to

83
00:09:46,667 --> 00:09:52,667
all their users. encrypted end
to end email, Not by default but
they're offering it. We're at a

84
00:09:54,833 --> 00:10:02,792
point where there is this
movement. There is a movement to
encrypt all the things. And it's

85
00:10:02,792 --> 00:10:08,000
working. We're seeing Yahoo,
Google, Facebook, twitter and
Microsoft, we're seeing the

86
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,542
technical teams within these
companies finally have the power
within the organization to get

87
00:10:13,542 --> 00:10:20,375
what they want. For sure their
security engineers within Google
and Yahoo who for years wanted

88
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:27,333
this stuff. I'm sure that the
people in the paranoid team at
Yahoo were embarrassed by the

89
00:10:27,333 --> 00:10:35,208
fact that the website wasn't SSL
enabled. At the end of the day
they don't choose the resources

90
00:10:35,208 --> 00:10:40,500
they're given and it's difficult
when you're a company thats not
doing well, losing users to

91
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:47,000
justify the expense, both in
human resources and equipments
to make that kind of shift,

92
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:52,750
change. What pressured Yahoo and
got the powers that be to
allocate those resources was to

93
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:59,708
hire CISO like Aleck Stamos was
major negative publicity. Front
page stories in newspapers

94
00:10:59,708 --> 00:11:05,708
around the world showing that
Yahoo was successfully targeted
by these intelligence agencies.

95
00:11:08,667 --> 00:11:14,750
The stories in the newspapers
help. Naming and shaming also
helped in a big way. Earlier

96
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:20,750
this year Google released data
on websites that do and do not
use encryption for e-mail. We

97
00:11:22,917 --> 00:11:30,333
can all visit our bank and
e-mail service and look for the
lock icon in the URL. You can

98
00:11:30,333 --> 00:11:35,500
see whether the website is
encrypting the data. It's much
more difficult to see whether

99
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:43,167
the e-mail that you're sending
is going over encrypted links
the whole way. And earlier this

100
00:11:43,167 --> 00:11:49,958
year as recently as January of
this year the answer may have
been 25 or 30 percent of servers

101
00:11:49,958 --> 00:11:55,792
on the internet were encrypting.
Google started releasing this
data a couple months ago and

102
00:11:55,792 --> 00:12:02,250
it's really, really useful,
because it's allowed us to name
and shame. And the fact is there

103
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:08,875
isn't a performance reason not
to have encryption, server to
server encryption. No reason at

104
00:12:08,875 --> 00:12:15,708
all. It's because no one ever
did it. For the last few months
I've been calling up the general

105
00:12:15,708 --> 00:12:20,167
counsels, the chief privacy
officers, the chief security
officers of the companies and

106
00:12:20,167 --> 00:12:27,750
one by one explaining why they
need to do this. And having this
data online has made it easy. I

107
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:33,458
have now something in URL form
that I can include in an e-mail
and say why are you not doing

108
00:12:33,458 --> 00:12:39,458
this. why you have an F letter
score Over the past few months
we got Comcast and apple and

109
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:46,917
Microsoft and many, many
companies are slowly doing this.
It makes a big difference. To be

110
00:12:46,917 --> 00:12:52,917
clear start CLS is opportunistic
encryption and not resistant to
active attacks. but if the name

111
00:12:55,583 --> 00:13:00,542
of the game is protecting us
against bulk surveillance this
is moving us in the right

112
00:13:00,542 --> 00:13:08,417
direction. So naming and shaming
is one technique. Another one
that I know a lot of people in

113
00:13:08,417 --> 00:13:13,542
the tech community think is
stupid is gamification this idea
of badges. And it's stupid but

114
00:13:13,542 --> 00:13:21,167
it works. That is why every app
built badges into their system.
We've seen two really, really

115
00:13:21,167 --> 00:13:26,167
useful and successful examples
of gamification that thrive the
adoption of encryption. The

116
00:13:26,167 --> 00:13:32,167
first is SSL labs. You can go to
the website and type in any
other website's name or URL and

117
00:13:36,792 --> 00:13:41,958
they will run a bunch of tests
and tell you how good the SSL
configuration is. And more

118
00:13:41,958 --> 00:13:46,625
importantly they give you a
letter score. And it's for
things like configuration

119
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:50,958
options and algorithm and and
perfect forward secrecy and
resistance to the beast attack

120
00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:55,875
and other things. In the last 6
months to a year we've seen
server operations changing their

121
00:13:55,875 --> 00:14:01,875
configurations because they want
an A plus score. This makes
surveillance more expensive.

122
00:14:06,167 --> 00:14:12,542
Perfect forward secrecy reduces
the risk to users when ket are
compromised or stolen or

123
00:14:12,542 --> 00:14:19,917
compelled from a company. A
couple Norwegian guys started
start TLS info. You can type in

124
00:14:19,917 --> 00:14:25,917
any domain name and it gives you
a letter score for the SMTP
encryption options. The NSA

125
00:14:28,708 --> 00:14:35,917
still has not got the best score
in the world. And this also has
been really, really useful in

126
00:14:35,917 --> 00:14:42,917
getting people to turn this
stuff on, So we've had naming
and shaming. We've had

127
00:14:42,917 --> 00:14:49,375
gameification. And another
method that worked well is
bribery. For the last six months

128
00:14:49,375 --> 00:14:55,375
I've been offering whiskey to
administrators of servers to
turn on SSL for their websites.

129
00:14:55,375 --> 00:15:01,375
It started as a joke but it's
actually working. So the first
major site to go SSL by default

130
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:15,875
was tech dirt citing the whiskey
offer. I need to send them three
bottles of whiskey to say thank

131
00:15:15,875 --> 00:15:21,875
you. I cant released the secret
yet but I got an e-mail from an
engineer at a very, very large

132
00:15:24,042 --> 00:15:29,417
website yesterday telling me
they will be going SSL by
default and specifically asking

133
00:15:29,417 --> 00:15:35,417
for whiskey. They didn't even
say please. This stuff works.
Then of course yesterday Google

134
00:15:40,833 --> 00:15:46,708
announced a huge move in which
they're going to give a boost in
the page rank scores to sites

135
00:15:46,708 --> 00:15:52,958
turning on SSL by default. This
is a really big deal. When you
think of all the scummy SEO

136
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:57,750
people )search engine
optimization and the tricks that
they will pull to get their

137
00:15:57,750 --> 00:16:03,917
websites one step higher on the
Google result, this is going to
be huge in terms of getting

138
00:16:03,917 --> 00:16:08,958
websites to do the right thing.
The combination of the carrot
and the stick is definitely

139
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:14,958
moving in the right direction.
So that's where we've been in
the last couple years. How we've

140
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:23,125
gotten companies to turn on SSL.
How we've gotten companies to
flip these options. In many

141
00:16:23,125 --> 00:16:29,125
cases our messaging can use some
work. Not just around SSL but in
interacting with policymakers in

142
00:16:32,792 --> 00:16:40,417
D.C. Some of the messaging that
we use in this community is good
for us but scary to the outside

143
00:16:40,417 --> 00:16:46,667
world. its so scary that it
hurts us down the road when were
litigating cases I'm going to

144
00:16:46,667 --> 00:16:50,167
give you a few examples of that.
It's really sort of funny in
some case bus it's funny in a

145
00:16:50,167 --> 00:16:56,167
private way. We need to clean up
our act and use a little bit of
marketing. To spin some of these

146
00:17:11,667 --> 00:17:14,833
technologies in a better
sounding way. I'm sure in the
last year many of you have seen

147
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:17,375
companies touting their NSA
proof technology. Of course this
stuff isn't NSA proof. And

148
00:17:17,375 --> 00:17:21,167
there's a debate to be had about
the merit of this and whether if
this is false sense of security.

149
00:17:21,167 --> 00:17:26,625
For the purpose of this
discussion, the problem with
saying that your stuff is NSA

150
00:17:26,625 --> 00:17:34,417
proof is that it strikes fear
into the hearts of policymakers.
Members of congress, they don't

151
00:17:34,417 --> 00:17:39,958
want NSA proof technology. They
think the NSA is doing their
job. They think that police

152
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:47,042
wiretaps are a good thing. We
can quibble about how often
they're used. But members of

153
00:17:47,042 --> 00:17:53,042
congress mostly support some
kind of surveillance. If we tout
surveillance proof, FBI proof,

154
00:17:56,875 --> 00:18:02,583
what they see in their minds are
technologies that that help the
bad guys and that's not good.

155
00:18:02,583 --> 00:18:08,583
This is Mushadin sectrets a
largely ridiculed terrorist
encryption app online. No one

156
00:18:11,292 --> 00:18:15,958
uses this thing but every couple
years there is a story about how
there is a different version of

157
00:18:15,958 --> 00:18:21,958
Al-Qaida encryption app. This is
really, really scary to people
in D.C. and policymakers and

158
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:29,458
they really believe this stuff
exists and that it's used and
it's preventing the FBI from

159
00:18:29,458 --> 00:18:35,458
capturing the next terrorist.
When we use language similar to
this stuff. Maybe you don't have

160
00:18:37,542 --> 00:18:45,417
an AK-47 as the logo for your
app, but when we use this it
looks really, really scary to

161
00:18:45,417 --> 00:18:52,625
the people in power and to the
courts. This is an excerpt for a
case from the ninth circuit

162
00:18:52,625 --> 00:18:59,375
called the cotterman case where
a guy brought a laptop back from
Mexico. this is a foot note in a

163
00:18:59,375 --> 00:19:04,417
majority decision From the court
saying we do not suggest that
password protecting an entire

164
00:19:04,417 --> 00:19:09,167
device as opposed to files
within a device can be a factor
supporting a reasonable

165
00:19:09,167 --> 00:19:14,167
suspicion determination. This is
a really long winded way of
saying that the ninth circuit

166
00:19:14,167 --> 00:19:20,167
thinks that disc encryption is
okay but per file or per folder
encryption is suspicious. thats

167
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:28,792
laughable but These are judges
that don't know a lot about
technology. They think that the

168
00:19:28,792 --> 00:19:34,000
encryption that comes built into
your operating system, the whole
disk encryption is reasonable.

169
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:39,292
its a legitimate Cyber security
technology that protects data
breaches, but they think if

170
00:19:39,292 --> 00:19:43,750
individual people choose
particular folders to encrypt,
that is a sign of something

171
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:50,667
suspicion. so that were just up
against We're up against judges
that think a file or a folder

172
00:19:50,667 --> 00:19:58,083
level encryption is inherently
suspect. When you're app or the
program you're using is a

173
00:19:58,083 --> 00:20:04,083
wiretap proof technology, that
judge freaks out. You look like
a bad guy just for using it in

174
00:20:07,583 --> 00:20:13,583
the first place. The message I'm
going to give you is we need our
technologies to be as boring as

175
00:20:15,667 --> 00:20:22,000
possible. We don't want to be
exciting. I know it's great to
have a DEFCON person on stage

176
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:29,125
with flashing lights and talk
about how you hacked this and
that but that is really scary to

177
00:20:29,125 --> 00:20:34,667
judges. The security and
encryption technology that we're
pushing now that we want the

178
00:20:34,667 --> 00:20:40,542
public to use, they need to be
non-threatening. Not to the user
but the court. The members of

179
00:20:40,542 --> 00:20:46,917
congress, the FBI. They need to
be as boring and standard as
possible. Another example. There

180
00:20:46,917 --> 00:20:52,917
was a supreme court oral
argument about O'Reilly about
whether police need a warrant to

181
00:20:56,458 --> 00:21:01,458
look at your phone. You are
arrested for something, can they
look at your phone and download

182
00:21:01,458 --> 00:21:07,458
all the data from the phone.
It's an exchange between the
lawyers and the chief judge of

183
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:16,500
the court. I'll show you the
excerpt in a minute. Chief
justice john Roberts thinks that

184
00:21:19,083 --> 00:21:23,958
someone with a single cell phone
is okay but someone with two
cell phones is a drug dealer.

185
00:21:29,583 --> 00:21:35,208
Roberts himself says that people
with two cell phones are
suspect. And when a lawyer says

186
00:21:35,208 --> 00:21:41,500
no, he says what's your
authority for having people with
many cell phone on their person.

187
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,500
He never met someone with two
cell phones even though the
majority of the lawyers in the

188
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:46,167
court have multiple cell phones
on them. In D.C. where I live,
people are forced to use

189
00:21:46,167 --> 00:21:48,375
blackberries and they also have
a second phone because they want
a useful smart phone. Having two

190
00:21:48,375 --> 00:21:54,375
cell phones in our world makes
you a bad guy. How do we push
back against the court when two

191
00:22:13,667 --> 00:22:19,583
cell phones are suspicious. If
you have an app on one of your
cell phones that lets you make

192
00:22:19,583 --> 00:22:24,792
wiretap proof calls, you're a
really, really bad guy. and i
dont want you to be a really

193
00:22:24,792 --> 00:22:30,250
really bad guy, And when we end
up litigating one of those cases
I don't want our defendant to be

194
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:36,625
a really, really bad guy. with
two phones and an NSA proof
calling out. which means don't

195
00:22:36,625 --> 00:22:42,000
talk about the NSA. The services
that you're building, the cool
apps and protocols you're

196
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:48,875
designing need to be boring and
not involve nations, state and
intelligence. You can do what

197
00:22:48,875 --> 00:22:54,083
the Tor project does and talk
about your threat model and
global pass adversaries. but

198
00:22:54,083 --> 00:22:59,458
don't talk about the NSA. It
doesn't help anyone. This is a
really good example of this

199
00:22:59,458 --> 00:23:05,458
point. This woman is Pamela hash
boar Jones. A Federal trade and
commision- commissioner. She

200
00:23:08,625 --> 00:23:16,000
left in 2010. And she was the
first U.S. government official
to ever give a public speech in

201
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:22,875
which she mentioned the word
SSL. She worked at the FTC, an
agency that I worked at. And in

202
00:23:22,875 --> 00:23:28,875
March 2010 she gave a speech and
asked all cloud computing
companies to turn on HTTPS. she

203
00:23:31,292 --> 00:23:35,042
said; Today i challenge all of
the companies that are not yet
using SSL by default that

204
00:23:35,042 --> 00:23:40,583
includes E-mail providers, et
cetera, step up and protect
consumers. dont do it some other

205
00:23:40,583 --> 00:23:45,333
time, make your website secure
by default. This is really
powerful language. Really good

206
00:23:45,333 --> 00:23:52,375
language from a senior
presidentially appointed U.S.
official. She is calling for

207
00:23:52,375 --> 00:23:58,375
something we all want. We all
want widespread encryption. She
doesn't talk about the NSA. Like

208
00:24:00,667 --> 00:24:05,958
wise this guy. Chuck Shumer.
super super law enforcement
friendly senator from new york,

209
00:24:08,792 --> 00:24:13,417
He loves law and order and
surveillance. This is him in
2011. Providers of major

210
00:24:13,417 --> 00:24:18,667
websites have a responsibility
to protect individuals who use
their sites and submit private

211
00:24:18,667 --> 00:24:24,667
information. It's my hope that
the private sites put in secure
HTTPS sites. again we have a pro

212
00:24:27,833 --> 00:24:33,583
Law enforcement senator calling
for companies to deploy
technology that make network

213
00:24:33,583 --> 00:24:39,958
based wire taps more difficult.
How do you get a senator to do
that. how do you get a senator

214
00:24:39,958 --> 00:24:45,875
to call for a technology that
makes life more difficult for
the police? Bribes are one way.

215
00:24:45,875 --> 00:24:52,292
Whiskey is another way. Or you
don't talk about the police. We
didn't talk about the NSA. These

216
00:24:52,292 --> 00:24:57,708
folks didn't talk about the NSA.
Instead they were talking about
hackers. Sorry, that's what

217
00:24:57,708 --> 00:24:59,708
hackers look like to people in
Washington, D.C. You guys have
your ninja masks in your bags.

218
00:24:59,708 --> 00:25:05,708
They were both responding to a
tool called firesheep released
by Eric butler. This was a easy

219
00:25:15,875 --> 00:25:21,167
to use graphical interface. a
Firefox plug in that captured
authentication cookies by going

220
00:25:21,167 --> 00:25:26,542
over the wire and let you log
into the accounts of other
people that were sharing the the

221
00:25:26,542 --> 00:25:32,750
same wifi network as you. This
was the wall of sheathe in
browser plug in form. What made

222
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:36,583
it a big deal, this was a plug
in that anyone could download
and in fact, several million of

223
00:25:36,583 --> 00:25:41,708
people downloaded it, then it
made it to The New York Times.
There was a story about the

224
00:25:41,708 --> 00:25:46,750
firesheep and then a month or
two later Chuck Shumer is
sending letters to Yahoo and

225
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:52,417
Amazon and Twitter telling them
to hurry up and turn on its SSL.
The way we get this encryption

226
00:25:52,417 --> 00:25:59,000
stuff deployed is by making it
palatable for the people in
power, making it it seem like an

227
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:05,000
anticrime technology. Antitheft
technology. In 2009, I and 37
other researchers signed a

228
00:26:08,917 --> 00:26:16,208
letter to Eric Schmidt back then
the CEO of Google in which we
called on Google to turn on SSL

229
00:26:16,208 --> 00:26:21,208
for Gmail. in this letter we
said we urge you to follow the
lead of the financial industry

230
00:26:21,208 --> 00:26:27,208
and enable SSL by default. This
is because of the huge threat
posed by identity threat. We

231
00:26:29,958 --> 00:26:36,542
didn't mention the NSA. We
didn't mention the police. This
was criminals at Starbucks. Of

232
00:26:36,542 --> 00:26:43,375
course Bruce Schneider know
about the bulk government
surveillance. But you don't have

233
00:26:43,375 --> 00:26:50,000
to advertise it. Right. Make it
easy for the people in power to
do the right thing and take

234
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,167
advantage of the boogie men that
we have which are identity
thieves. The other thing to note

235
00:26:53,167 --> 00:27:00,917
is that in the United States we
don't have a privacy
commissioner. In Canada and

236
00:27:00,917 --> 00:27:08,708
European countries they have
privacy commissioners that are
responsible for all things

237
00:27:08,708 --> 00:27:13,667
privacy. We don't have that in
the United States. We have the
federal trade commissions that

238
00:27:13,667 --> 00:27:17,750
regulates accepted business
practices and goes after tech
companies for lying about

239
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:23,750
privacy. The FCC that goes after
obscenity like Howard stern on
the air. We don't have a

240
00:27:28,375 --> 00:27:35,458
national privacy regulator. If
we want the two regulators that
we have to do thing that we care

241
00:27:35,458 --> 00:27:40,667
about we have to portray in
language that they understand.
We have to make it seem like

242
00:27:40,667 --> 00:27:44,458
it's consistent with their
mission. so the federal trtade
commission cares about identity

243
00:27:44,458 --> 00:27:51,083
theft, The FCC cares about the
radio and phone networks. If we
want them on our side and want

244
00:27:51,083 --> 00:27:56,125
them to pressure companies and
give speeches, we need to help
them to do so and that means not

245
00:27:56,125 --> 00:28:01,250
talking about the NSA. We can
talk about it in this community.
But when talking to the outsider

246
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:07,250
we can't use that language that
isn't scary t them That means we
need to talk about cyber. I know

247
00:28:19,167 --> 00:28:25,167
that there are many people that
think the word cyber is stupid.
It's ridiculous that people in

248
00:28:32,458 --> 00:28:34,625
suits talk about cyber as
something serious. When you hear
the word cyber you think of

249
00:28:34,625 --> 00:28:40,625
something that looks like this.
It's really difficult to find an
image that captures cyber sex

250
00:28:46,542 --> 00:28:52,542
that is funny but not too
offensive. It took me hours to
find this. Most of us when we

251
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:59,833
think of cyber we think of
awkward conversations in AOL
chat rooms with people who may

252
00:28:59,833 --> 00:29:06,583
or may not be the actual age
they tell us they are. And we
don't think of something that is

253
00:29:06,583 --> 00:29:12,125
serious. We don't think of
cyber-security. For many of us
when we hear the word cyber we

254
00:29:12,125 --> 00:29:18,125
think of age, sex, and location.
But the fact is that for the
people that matter, the people

255
00:29:20,292 --> 00:29:26,292
in power, right, for them ...
For them cyber is real. Cyber is
the real deal for people in D.C.

256
00:29:33,542 --> 00:29:39,250
Cyber-security is the only part
of the defense department budget
that is going up. The only part

257
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:44,458
of the DHS budget that is going
up. One of the things
legislation actually moves in

258
00:29:44,458 --> 00:29:50,458
D.C. so by us ridiculing cyber,
we're not part of the debate
around cyber. We're absent. We

259
00:29:56,292 --> 00:30:02,375
let them set the agenda around
cyber because we think it's
silly because they're using the

260
00:30:02,375 --> 00:30:10,208
wrong words. This is the
director of national
intelligence. Famously lied

261
00:30:10,208 --> 00:30:16,208
before congress. And so James
Clapper in March of 2014 said
when it comes to the distinct

262
00:30:18,833 --> 00:30:25,250
threat areas, in their annual
threat assessment, this year
leads to cyber and it's hard to

263
00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:30,083
overemphasize its significance
here we have the top national
security official in the United

264
00:30:30,083 --> 00:30:35,250
States telling the senate that
this cyber thing is the biggest
threat this country faces.

265
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:41,250
Bigger than terrorism. These
cyber threats put all sectors of
our country at risk. Again, with

266
00:30:47,125 --> 00:30:54,250
this language, the average
non-tech savvy senator or member
of congress, they're thinking oh

267
00:30:54,250 --> 00:30:57,667
my goodness this cyber-security
stuff is huge. It's a huge
threat and we have to do

268
00:30:57,667 --> 00:31:03,667
something and we're not present.
We're not present in that
debate. And we really should be.

269
00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:09,833
So you may think, okay, well the
reason these people are talking
about cyber-security all the

270
00:31:09,833 --> 00:31:16,292
time is because of money. And
that's entirely true. Right.
They're a defense contractor

271
00:31:16,292 --> 00:31:18,958
that are advertising zero days,
on the sub way in D.C. You the
ex-director of NSA that leaves

272
00:31:18,958 --> 00:31:26,500
and offering himself at a
million dollars a month to
clients. Cyber security business

273
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:32,500
is big business in D.C. But so
what. What matters is that
people care. What matters is if

274
00:31:38,375 --> 00:31:43,208
you're talk about cyber-security
you get in the meeting. People
listen to you. People think it's

275
00:31:43,208 --> 00:31:49,583
important. Cyber-security is
important in the eyes of
policymakers which means we

276
00:31:49,583 --> 00:31:54,542
should be using the language of
cyber-security for all of the
stuff we're doing. Every

277
00:31:54,542 --> 00:31:59,958
technology that we're building
we should be pitching as
cyber-security. And the reason

278
00:31:59,958 --> 00:32:07,208
for this, cyber security is
moving through D.C. whether we
like it or not. Let me explain

279
00:32:07,208 --> 00:32:13,000
how this works. You have these
ex-generals and ex-government
officials who go on and work for

280
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:18,542
defense contractors and every
week they go to a meeting with
congressional staff to pitch how

281
00:32:18,542 --> 00:32:24,542
big of a threat cyber-security
is. On one side of the table you
have this ex-general or

282
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:32,500
ex-senior government official
that doesn't really understand
technology. And on the other

283
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:37,958
side of the table you have a
member of congress that doesn't
understand technology or a 24

284
00:32:37,958 --> 00:32:43,958
year-old staffer with a science
and technology degree that
doesn't understand technology.

285
00:32:46,125 --> 00:32:50,750
They never get into the detail
of saying this particular
technology is a threat to our

286
00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:56,792
cyber-security. If the meeting
is a success, the best possible
outcome is the member of

287
00:32:56,792 --> 00:33:03,375
congress leaves with a feeling
that China is attacking us.
Cyber-security is a massive

288
00:33:03,375 --> 00:33:08,958
threat. We need to dedicate more
money to this and maybe the
company that had the meeting,

289
00:33:08,958 --> 00:33:15,792
their technology might be
useful. That is it. We had one
person that lives in D.C. who is

290
00:33:15,792 --> 00:33:22,667
laughing. This is true. This is
actually how it works. What that
means is this is happening every

291
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:29,208
day, every week, these meetings
are taking place in hearing
rooms and committees, every week

292
00:33:29,208 --> 00:33:35,208
someone is coming in ask saying
that cyber-security is a huge
thing. Now if we try to stand

293
00:33:37,667 --> 00:33:43,000
there and say, in fact this
cyber stuff is bull shit,
they're going to ignore us.

294
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:49,375
There are too many people saying
that cyber-security is a
problem. We cannot push back

295
00:33:49,375 --> 00:33:56,500
against that. But what we can do
is say that these other things
are a cyber-security problem and

296
00:33:56,500 --> 00:34:01,125
the technology that we're
building protects us all from
cyber threats. We're not telling

297
00:34:01,125 --> 00:34:06,583
them the briefings they got from
ex-generals are wrong, we're
just saying there are better

298
00:34:06,583 --> 00:34:14,250
things to do to keep us safe.
The average member of congress
doesn't understand technology.

299
00:34:14,250 --> 00:34:17,917
This is Ted Stevens for all of
you that don't recognize the
face. He became famous for this

300
00:34:17,917 --> 00:34:23,917
internet as a series of tubes
thing. My guess is the way that
meeting went down is you had

301
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:32,208
some tech person come into a
briefing and he was describing
the internet as a bunch of

302
00:34:32,208 --> 00:34:37,958
pipes. And pipes is like a
fairly accurate description. We
talk about pipes in the tech

303
00:34:37,958 --> 00:34:43,292
community. And Stevens is
sitting there drawing on his
note pad and that one word

304
00:34:43,292 --> 00:34:50,333
sticks in his head and then he
gets to the senate and gives a
speech and pipes become tubes

305
00:34:50,333 --> 00:34:56,333
and he becomes a laughing stock.
He retained from that meeting
that the internet involved

306
00:34:59,917 --> 00:35:04,583
tubes. All we need to do is
convince them that our
technologies protect

307
00:35:04,583 --> 00:35:10,583
cyber-security. We don't have to
go very far because they don't
go too far into the woods.

308
00:35:13,125 --> 00:35:20,500
Traditionally those of us who
work in this space, the lawyers,
the law, the advocates, those of

309
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:26,500
us that work in this space, we
have a real uphill battle. We go
into a meeting with a member of

310
00:35:28,875 --> 00:35:34,458
congress and say you shouldn't
pass legislation requiring
backdoors in encryption

311
00:35:34,458 --> 00:35:36,458
technology. You shouldn't pass
laws requiring companies to
retain records of everything

312
00:35:36,458 --> 00:35:40,625
their customers do. you
shouldn't pass laws prohibiting
what people do with the

313
00:35:40,625 --> 00:35:46,625
technologies they buy, We find
some people who are sympathetic
to this message but there are a

314
00:35:52,208 --> 00:35:58,417
lot of people in congress whose
first priority is public safety.
And in their eyes there is a

315
00:35:58,417 --> 00:36:05,125
trade off between public safety
and privacy. There are some
members who really care about

316
00:36:05,125 --> 00:36:09,500
privacy and civil liberties and
are willing to go gun hoe down
the privacy and civil liberties

317
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:15,583
path path. But there are many
others care a little bit more
about public safety. They're

318
00:36:15,583 --> 00:36:20,708
worried the next time there is
an attack, their vote no on a
bill will come back to haunt

319
00:36:20,708 --> 00:36:27,417
them. that they will loose
election No one wants to vote no
on a piece of legislation that

320
00:36:27,417 --> 00:36:33,000
will make it more difficult for
the police to catch the bad guy.
That's the reality of the world.

321
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:38,000
We can only convince so many
members of congress to put
privacy and civil liberties

322
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:45,458
ahead of national security. What
if it's a security versus
security debate? What if instead

323
00:36:45,458 --> 00:36:51,125
of trading off privacy against
national security, there are
different security threats that

324
00:36:51,125 --> 00:36:57,167
the members have to weigh. What
if adding back doors to
communications network opens

325
00:36:57,167 --> 00:37:03,167
those networks up to compromise
by hackers. It's a security
versus security debate. What if

326
00:37:06,083 --> 00:37:11,667
you retain large amounts of data
that data becomes an attractive
targets for criminals. oh

327
00:37:11,667 --> 00:37:18,708
suddenly data retention is a
more complex issue. By embracing
the language of cyber security

328
00:37:18,708 --> 00:37:25,333
we can shift this from a debate
where we lose to a debate where
we might win. Many of you may

329
00:37:25,333 --> 00:37:31,125
have heard of the four horseman
of the information apocalypses.
There are trump cards in

330
00:37:31,125 --> 00:37:37,125
political debates. Pedophiles
and drug dealers, it's tough to
push legislation when members or

331
00:37:41,375 --> 00:37:45,500
pro-law enforcement people say
this bill or this technology
helps terrorists hide their

332
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:51,500
stuff. And traditionally those
of us on the public interest
side of the table have always

333
00:37:55,208 --> 00:38:01,208
had a bad set of cards. We've
had the bad facts. All the case
law, all the fourths in the case

334
00:38:03,917 --> 00:38:06,292
law is drug dealers and
pedophiles. Everyone's fourth
amendment rights come from

335
00:38:06,292 --> 00:38:12,292
really bad cases with really bad
attacks. Traditionally the four
horse men were not good for our

336
00:38:17,833 --> 00:38:24,875
side. But now there is a now
horseman. And he looks like
this. His name is Wang Dong.

337
00:38:24,875 --> 00:38:31,292
This is a real FBI wanted
poster. this is one of the
chinese military officials who

338
00:38:31,292 --> 00:38:37,292
was indicted by the U.S.
government. Foreign nation
hackers are a huge threat and a

339
00:38:40,833 --> 00:38:47,458
threat that policymakers take
seriously. Chinese cyber hackers
are just as big of a boogie man

340
00:38:47,458 --> 00:38:53,458
as pedophiles and drug dealers.
Now members of congress have to
way decisions that pit things

341
00:38:57,292 --> 00:39:02,542
that may help the police against
things that help the nation
state attackers. Suddenly we

342
00:39:02,542 --> 00:39:08,542
don't get steam rolled. What
that means is we need to reframe
the debate around the technology

343
00:39:15,333 --> 00:39:22,292
that we all care about. For far
too long Tor has been a
technology to help citizens

344
00:39:22,292 --> 00:39:27,750
protect their privacy online
where the internet is paralleled
and censored, that is not the

345
00:39:27,750 --> 00:39:31,625
case. TOR is not about
journalists or dissidents. It's
a cyber security technology.

346
00:39:31,625 --> 00:39:35,125
Silent circle or signal, two
voice apps that encrypt your
communication that goes over the

347
00:39:35,125 --> 00:39:38,625
carrier's network. These are not
wiretap proof telephone
communication acts. These are

348
00:39:38,625 --> 00:39:44,417
cyber security technology that
protects you from nation state
adversaries using MC-cachers.

349
00:39:44,417 --> 00:39:48,167
see how this works? Tech secure
is not an anti-surveillance
technology. It's a

350
00:39:48,167 --> 00:39:53,542
pro-cyber-security technology to
keep you safe where the phone
companies have not employed

351
00:39:53,542 --> 00:39:59,542
strong security technologies. We
need to embrace this language
that everything we're doing must

352
00:40:14,083 --> 00:40:20,083
be cyber. Even if you think it's
silly, just keep saying it.
Cyber, cyber, cyber. It sounds

353
00:40:27,583 --> 00:40:34,458
silly, but in a few years we're
going to have a face that the
ACLU will almost certainly join

354
00:40:34,458 --> 00:40:40,167
in some way where the government
will say that encryption, a
particular form of encryption is

355
00:40:40,167 --> 00:40:47,208
a devil's technology used by
drug dealers and bad guys. Now
we can see that -- then we'll be

356
00:40:47,208 --> 00:40:54,000
able to say that most of the web
is using HTTPS and government
agencies are using PGP, well be

357
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:59,750
able to say that govt agencies
are using TOR to protect our
data from bad guys. When that

358
00:40:59,750 --> 00:41:05,208
happens the courts will not be
able to demonize these
technologies. suddenlu sing TOR

359
00:41:05,208 --> 00:41:11,208
or voice encryption or full disk
or folder encryption will not be
suspicious and the way we get

360
00:41:13,583 --> 00:41:20,792
there is through cyber. its a
war lets fight this cyber war...
