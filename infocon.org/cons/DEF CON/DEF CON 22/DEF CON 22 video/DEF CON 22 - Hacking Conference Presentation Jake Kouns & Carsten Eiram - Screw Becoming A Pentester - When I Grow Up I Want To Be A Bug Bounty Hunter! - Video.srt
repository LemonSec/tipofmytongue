1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,958
>>Umm so the purpose of the talk
today is to talk about bug
bounty programs, what going on.

2
00:00:05,958 --> 00:00:11,250
Give you a little bit of
education and then talk about
the various types and what's

3
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:16,917
happening. There's a lot that's
going on out there. There are
some people who saw hands that

4
00:00:16,917 --> 00:00:22,542
went up that are doing this
stuff. Use them as resources.
There are some folks that run

5
00:00:22,542 --> 00:00:27,750
bug bounty programs in this
room, so definitely spend time
with them as well. My name is

6
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:33,250
Jake Kouns, I am the CSO for a
company called Risk Based
Security. This Carsten Eiram he

7
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:38,375
is the Chief Research Officer,
he's done a bunch of bug bounty
stuff so with that we're going

8
00:00:38,375 --> 00:00:42,500
get rolling. The reason we got
in to this stuff is that we
actually do a lot of

9
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:45,792
vulnerability intelligence and
we've been tracking for awhile
what is going on with

10
00:00:45,792 --> 00:00:50,833
disclosures and what's happening
and how is money influencing
what's going on in research.

11
00:00:50,833 --> 00:00:57,833
That's what leads us here today.
All right, so, information
security. Career decisions. I

12
00:00:57,833 --> 00:01:04,083
would imagine most of you are
already somehow in the security
world doing some kind of work or

13
00:01:04,083 --> 00:01:10,000
you're here because you want to
learn and work your way into a
security role somewhere, right?

14
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,542
And there's lots of choices,
right? I think you've been
hearing over and over that it's

15
00:01:15,542 --> 00:01:20,750
really hard to be an I.T.
generalist these days , even
worse an I.T. security

16
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:26,000
generalist, you can do it but
everything is getting so
specialized that you sorta have

17
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:33,625
to pick a role, right? And so we
go out there and we look you see
all these words like analyst and

18
00:01:33,625 --> 00:01:38,833
auditor and specialist and all
this other stuff doing some
searches on some job hunting

19
00:01:38,833 --> 00:01:44,750
sites. It's funny our favorite
one was the cybersecurity hunter
as a title, we thought that was

20
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:50,000
pretty amusing. Does anyone have
that as a title? [ laughter ]
No. You're working on it. Is

21
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:56,000
that what it was? What it comes
down to typically and I hate to
sort of, to generalize it this

22
00:01:58,375 --> 00:02:04,417
much sort of you're presented
with two pills, right? It's the
blue pill or the red pill. How

23
00:02:04,417 --> 00:02:12,083
many blue pill people are in the
room? Couple. A lot of people
seem to be undecided on what

24
00:02:12,083 --> 00:02:17,333
you're going to take, right? But
what it comes down to it most
people say they're red pills the

25
00:02:17,333 --> 00:02:22,458
way they go, right? And almost
everyone seems to be talking
about offense and that is what

26
00:02:22,458 --> 00:02:28,458
is sexy, et cetera. Blue teamers
seem to be really uptight these
days, right? It feels like

27
00:02:30,542 --> 00:02:36,208
there's too much red team
attention going on the blue team
guys feel very sort of taken

28
00:02:36,208 --> 00:02:41,125
aback , right, you know, like
it's not fair to them. I can say
that because I start my career

29
00:02:41,125 --> 00:02:47,750
as a fire wall guy so I was a
blue team guy for a long time.
So, why do people like red

30
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:53,167
teams, right? There's a lot of
reasons and typically these are
some of the ones that come back,

31
00:02:53,167 --> 00:02:57,375
right? Constant learning
opportunities, you get to play
and break things, I mean how

32
00:02:57,375 --> 00:03:02,792
cool is that, right? That's what
you're paid to do and you're
generally well paid to do this.

33
00:03:02,792 --> 00:03:07,000
And even sometimes you get to
mess around with social
engineering stuff which some

34
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,708
people in the room really enjoy.
And it can lead to a lot of
other fun things trying out,

35
00:03:12,708 --> 00:03:17,208
right? Then at the end, there's
nothing better than popping a
box, getting rude, something

36
00:03:17,208 --> 00:03:22,917
about winning, just feels great
and people love that. When you
say red team it can be sort of

37
00:03:22,917 --> 00:03:28,042
broader but people think of that
as pentesting, right? And it
seems like everywhere you go and

38
00:03:28,042 --> 00:03:32,542
you talk to vendor or security
vendors and companies everyone
is looking for Pentesters right

39
00:03:32,542 --> 00:03:38,250
now. But actually when you go
out on a job search board, like
Indeed, you do a search for

40
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:43,958
Pentesting only sort of 17 come
up, you know, jobs that are
open, if you will. But it does

41
00:03:43,958 --> 00:03:49,500
feel like everyone is looking
for some type of Pentester these
days. When you're a Pentester

42
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:52,583
there can be some things that
are pretty painful, right? So,
there's a lot of fun but there's

43
00:03:52,583 --> 00:03:56,500
also some things that go along
with it that maybe aren't so
great. And a few things are that

44
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:59,917
you are usually working at some
sort of company and you're
dealing with some sort of

45
00:03:59,917 --> 00:04:04,542
political politics, those sorts
of things which is no fun,
right? You have to test during

46
00:04:04,542 --> 00:04:09,833
specific hours, many of those
times can be sort of when you do
want to be sleeping or drinking

47
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:15,833
or doing something else later at
night, weekends, et cetera. You
end up having to write these

48
00:04:20,292 --> 00:04:24,583
really, really long reports and
you know no one is going to read
or even understand but you have

49
00:04:24,583 --> 00:04:28,625
to make it really, really long
because it has to seem like it's
valuable, right. It's a short

50
00:04:28,625 --> 00:04:32,667
report, why would the customer
pay all that money for the short
report, so get in there and

51
00:04:32,667 --> 00:04:36,250
write some stuff, right? Then
you do have to deal with these
things called clients, right?

52
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:38,958
So, statement of works, or
present those findings
conference calls, et cetera.

53
00:04:38,958 --> 00:04:42,792
Those are things that just
aren't as fun, right? So there's
also an option of being an

54
00:04:42,792 --> 00:04:46,375
independent Pentester. That
means you don't have to work for
the man but there's still a

55
00:04:46,375 --> 00:04:50,375
break down, right? That break
down is roughly we'll say a
third of it, it's the fun part,

56
00:04:50,375 --> 00:04:54,208
breaking and doing stuff. Then
you got another third of it's
the administrative task and

57
00:04:54,208 --> 00:04:58,958
documentation then that last bit
being a sales weasel, right,
like you're going to have to

58
00:04:58,958 --> 00:05:03,583
find work, it doesn't show up at
your door and go I'm so happy
can you do this Pentest for us,

59
00:05:03,583 --> 00:05:09,208
right? It's just not going to
happen that way. So, there's got
to be sort of a better career

60
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:14,708
choice potentially right, maybe
a bit more of a tasty decision
and we think that there might

61
00:05:14,708 --> 00:05:21,458
be, right? And you can be this
guy, right? You like this, the
quick pepper sprayer guy, right.

62
00:05:21,458 --> 00:05:29,458
You can be dog or what I say is
better yet, you can be this guy.
And hopefully in this sort of

63
00:05:29,458 --> 00:05:33,917
line up of going on the bug
bounty hunter route you're 90%
hopefully of your time

64
00:05:33,917 --> 00:05:39,042
researching vulnerabilities and
what not and then maybe that
little bit less time, 10% or so

65
00:05:39,042 --> 00:05:45,292
is working on the write-ups and
all that other stuff. All right,
so with that I'm going to have

66
00:05:45,292 --> 00:05:50,917
Carsten do a quick overview sort
of to set the bounty stage with
you guys. >> One of the first

67
00:05:50,917 --> 00:05:57,333
things we want to cover,
research motivation, back in the
old days before we had all these

68
00:05:57,333 --> 00:06:02,708
bug bounties. Back then we were
reporting vulnerabilities to the
vendors, because it looked good

69
00:06:02,708 --> 00:06:08,667
on our resumes and it got us
creating vendor advisories. If
you didn't have a job or wanted

70
00:06:08,667 --> 00:06:12,292
to get in to this sort of
business there was a good way to
actually get a job and

71
00:06:12,292 --> 00:06:17,500
potentially for one of these
companies that you found
vulnerabilities in. If you

72
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:23,583
already had a job, it could
obviously lead to higher
salaries or better jobs. So why

73
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:28,375
we like to go around saying that
oh, back in the old school days
we were so altruistic, let's be

74
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:32,250
honest there was nothing
altruistic about it, it looked
good for us and worked out

75
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:38,250
nicely. The problem was that it
wasn't hassle free. Reporting
vulnerabilities to vendors was

76
00:06:41,667 --> 00:06:48,875
often very painful, often they
didn't respond, if you did get a
response they were often a legal

77
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:54,083
threat. So, a lot of researchers
just said, you know what, fuck
it, lets find some alternatives.

78
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:58,125
So, what a lot of researchers
did they published it just
somewhere else, like we just

79
00:06:58,125 --> 00:07:04,708
dropped it on a mailing list, we
would trade, give it away within
groups for respect and goodwill,

80
00:07:04,708 --> 00:07:09,542
we would use it offensively for
fun and or profit or we would
just kind of say, ah, found

81
00:07:09,542 --> 00:07:14,708
this, fuck it, store it in a
digital box somewhere, move on.
Or, there was this other option

82
00:07:14,708 --> 00:07:20,375
because we did have monetary
options back then also, there
was the grey markets, three or

83
00:07:20,375 --> 00:07:25,708
four letter agencies and we also
had the black markets. So, we
had these options if this was

84
00:07:25,708 --> 00:07:33,667
something we wanted to do. So
some of the vendors and security
companies kind of realized that,

85
00:07:33,667 --> 00:07:39,250
you know what, if we start
rewarding discoveries we can
actually centralize researchers

86
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:44,875
come to us and report
vulnerabilities to us. In 2002
Idefense created their

87
00:07:44,875 --> 00:07:49,708
vulnerability coordination
program where researchers can
come to them, sell the

88
00:07:49,708 --> 00:07:52,750
vulnerability findings to them,
they would coordinate, they
would provide the information to

89
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:58,958
their customers, make a business
model out of it that way. 2004
Mozilla created their bug bounty

90
00:07:58,958 --> 00:08:04,500
program where they were paying
$500 bucks for critical
vulnerabilities. So, we wanted

91
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:10,792
do a quick pop quiz. In what
year was the first bug bounty
program started? Because a lot

92
00:08:10,792 --> 00:08:16,792
of people considered this to be
something pretty new, anyone
else? No? 1990? 1995, exactly.

93
00:08:23,917 --> 00:08:31,667
Then do you also know who did
it. Netscape, exactly. In
October 1995, Netscape actually

94
00:08:31,667 --> 00:08:35,750
launched the first bug bounty
program where they were paying
money and what was very

95
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:39,667
interesting about that program
was the fact this they said we
don't want to pay people to find

96
00:08:39,667 --> 00:08:44,083
vulnerabilities in our stable
products, we want to incentivize
researchers to find

97
00:08:44,083 --> 00:08:49,125
vulnerabilities in our beader
products so before they go
stable...does that remind you of

98
00:08:49,125 --> 00:08:54,958
any other companies that just
did a bug bounty program
recently? Microsoft actually did

99
00:08:54,958 --> 00:09:00,500
this recently and people were
talking about that's a new way
of doing it but actually someone

100
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:07,833
was doing it 20 years ago.
Through 2000 to 2008 disclosure
of this huge battleground

101
00:09:07,833 --> 00:09:11,792
between vendors and researchers,
researchers have problems
getting vendors to respond and

102
00:09:11,792 --> 00:09:16,042
taking it seriously and getting
them to understand the issues,
the perception was whether it

103
00:09:16,042 --> 00:09:20,250
was true or not that the vendors
didn't take vulnerabilities and
security seriously unless we it

104
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:25,750
dropped on a mailing list. And
we like to say that researchers
back then were hard core full

105
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:31,875
disclosure the quote unquote,
right way. The focus was on
getting bugs fixed that's what

106
00:09:31,875 --> 00:09:37,875
they were focusing a lot on.
Then in 2007 we saw the first
kind of bug bounty competition,

107
00:09:40,333 --> 00:09:46,625
the PWN2OWN where you could win
MacBook pros and ZDI was
offering up $10,000 U.S. dollars

108
00:09:46,625 --> 00:09:52,750
also in bounties. That
competition has grown to 2010
certainly $100,000 pay on the

109
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:59,375
line and this competition grows
every single year. They set the
bar high for being able to win

110
00:09:59,375 --> 00:10:07,083
this money but if you can do
this there's a ton of money in
it, there's a ton of PR. In

111
00:10:07,083 --> 00:10:13,292
March 2009 we also saw some
researchers coming out a bit
more saying, you know what, we

112
00:10:13,292 --> 00:10:18,125
have this new philosophy, no
more free box. We want to get
paid for our work, it's

113
00:10:18,125 --> 00:10:23,833
valuable, we want to get paid.
To be honest, we don't really
know how much affect it had. But

114
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:29,833
it definitely sparked a debate
and it also made it very, very
clear to vendors what these many

115
00:10:32,667 --> 00:10:38,708
research expectations were. We
wanted to get compensated for
the work that we were doing. So

116
00:10:38,708 --> 00:10:43,833
that leads us to present day
where bug bounty now all the
rage, everyone is doing it, ones

117
00:10:43,833 --> 00:10:47,208
that aren't doing it kinda want
to do it because it looks good
and it's getting a lot of

118
00:10:47,208 --> 00:10:51,458
attention. Now we're seeing all
these different type of bounty
programs. We are seeing what are

119
00:10:51,458 --> 00:10:56,875
called company run bug bounties,
we see third party bug bounties.
We see these competitions as

120
00:10:56,875 --> 00:11:02,125
mentioned. Krausers spot
programs - Which all things
we'll be covering next and also

121
00:11:02,125 --> 00:11:07,750
see different types of rewards,
we see cash, prizes like
T-shirts, get a mark, get some

122
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:13,792
conference attendee sentence,
fame and glory appreciation, but
if we want to do this as a

123
00:11:13,792 --> 00:11:19,042
career choice and not just be
hobby hunters, cash is king,
right? End of day getting a

124
00:11:19,042 --> 00:11:22,708
mark, getting a T-shirt is nice
for the hobby hunters but we
want money, right? That's what

125
00:11:22,708 --> 00:11:28,708
we want to focus on. So by that
Jake will now discuss company
run bug bounties. 11:27 >> All

126
00:11:31,042 --> 00:11:38,708
right. So our definitions this
is what we believe these are.
We're calling it company run bug

127
00:11:38,708 --> 00:11:44,667
bounty basically it's the
bounties being run by the
company that owns the website

128
00:11:44,667 --> 00:11:51,042
that you'd be going after or the
software, right? Almost all
cases reporting and coordination

129
00:11:51,042 --> 00:11:56,458
all that sort of stuff is
directly with the company and
not through some sort of

130
00:11:56,458 --> 00:12:00,500
intermediary. The process is
simple you discover a
vulnerability, you send the

131
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:06,583
details to the vendor or some
list that they have information
on the website of what it is,

132
00:12:06,583 --> 00:12:11,667
hopefully the vendor can
reproduce it and then they will
accept your submission and get

133
00:12:11,667 --> 00:12:17,042
paid, right? The number of bug
bounty programs just continues
to grow, every time we turn

134
00:12:17,042 --> 00:12:23,125
around we're finding more and
more that pop up we maintain a
list of bug bounty programs as

135
00:12:23,125 --> 00:12:28,875
we map the vulnerabilities that
we're discovering, just to give
you a little bit of sort of

136
00:12:28,875 --> 00:12:34,958
understanding of what is going
on there is around 300 or so
programs. 260 of those have some

137
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:40,708
type of reward, about 165
provide some sort of recognition
and about 75 of those have some

138
00:12:40,708 --> 00:12:46,667
sort of monetary reward. Bug
crowd has a really nice crowd
source list publicly. You can go

139
00:12:46,667 --> 00:12:50,875
to their site and check it out
and look for some of the ones if
you want some more details. I

140
00:12:50,875 --> 00:12:57,667
can't really talk about bounties
without talking about Google,
right? Google started providing

141
00:12:57,667 --> 00:13:03,750
bounties in 2010 they continue
to be one of the more serious
players when it comes to the

142
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:11,333
bounty space. We believe they're
a big reason that bounties took
off with 2.7 million in prizes,

143
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:17,250
August 2013 Google paid out a
little bit more than $2 million
for over 2,000 valid reports.

144
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:24,250
Some pretty serious money. They
also took things a bit further
as well saying we're also not

145
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:31,667
going to pay for things in our
software but we'll pay for vulms
in other software as well,

146
00:13:31,667 --> 00:13:37,833
right? They really just continue
to push for fixing vulms
disclosing them in a timely

147
00:13:37,833 --> 00:13:44,833
manner, fixing them in a timely
manner these sorts of things.
They have been a serious player.

148
00:13:44,833 --> 00:13:51,000
Talk a little bit about
Facebook. So Facebook was --
their bounty program was founded

149
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:57,583
in 2011. They have over 1500
bounties that have been paid to,
date about 600 unique

150
00:13:57,583 --> 00:14:02,958
researchers were paid and they
paid researchers in 79
countries. With the top

151
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:09,958
countries being India, USA and
U.K. And their whole premise
again is to find issues that can

152
00:14:09,958 --> 00:14:15,708
help make Facebook a more secure
platform, right? Couple of
interesting bits, their average

153
00:14:15,708 --> 00:14:21,708
bounty is in the low thousands.
They have a minimum of $500 that
they pay for a bounty they don't

154
00:14:23,958 --> 00:14:31,375
have a maximum set. So it all
just depends, and the largest
bounty that they have paid out

155
00:14:31,375 --> 00:14:37,958
was a little more than $33,000.
So you can get a pretty
substantial payment from those

156
00:14:37,958 --> 00:14:43,333
guys, they have more details on
that vulnerability on their
website you can find out more

157
00:14:43,333 --> 00:14:49,333
details about the program.
Pretty interesting to see there.
What's also interesting is they

158
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:58,125
provided us some information, we
actually sent out questionnaires
to a bunch of vendors asking for

159
00:14:58,125 --> 00:15:03,958
feedback as well they provided
us with some information also
they blogged about it, they paid

160
00:15:03,958 --> 00:15:10,167
out more than $1.5 million in
bounty rewards in 2013 you're
talking about a fair amount of

161
00:15:10,167 --> 00:15:15,667
money. So that was really
interesting but couple other
things that popped up that were

162
00:15:15,667 --> 00:15:21,125
really eye opening. They
received close to 15,000 bug
submissions in 2013 that is a

163
00:15:21,125 --> 00:15:27,708
huge number, right? And they
said it was 246% increase in one
year, the number of vulms that

164
00:15:27,708 --> 00:15:33,542
were submitted to them. What was
eye opening that only 687 were
actually deemed valid and

165
00:15:33,542 --> 00:15:39,042
received some sort of financial
compensation, right? For you
that is really early if you're

166
00:15:39,042 --> 00:15:46,000
not great with math that's not a
high number, right? It's not
great. So you want to make sure

167
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,417
that if you're trying to do this
for money that you're one of the
ones in that range so whether

168
00:15:50,417 --> 00:15:55,750
it's following their rules which
we seen problems with, they have
some things where it says don't

169
00:15:55,750 --> 00:16:01,167
attack live profiles and people
do and they still expect to get
paid you're not going to. Follow

170
00:16:01,167 --> 00:16:06,167
the rules, get some stuff clear
to them you want to get in there
so you're one of the ones

171
00:16:06,167 --> 00:16:12,583
getting paid not one of the ones
that is getting nothing or a
T-shirt. We did mention that a

172
00:16:12,583 --> 00:16:18,708
list continues to grow that is
very true but there are some --
lots of vendors out there that

173
00:16:18,708 --> 00:16:22,667
you would expect that would have
bounty programs and do not.
There's a lot of hold out. So

174
00:16:22,667 --> 00:16:28,667
still room for a lot of growth
there. So again if you're trying
to make this a career, it seems

175
00:16:32,083 --> 00:16:36,375
like more and more companies are
going that path and we expect to
see more coming. All right. Now

176
00:16:36,375 --> 00:16:40,500
we're going to talk about what
we call third party bounties.
This is sort of set the stage

177
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:46,458
for this, this is bounties that
are run by other companies that
do not own the software and

178
00:16:46,458 --> 00:16:53,000
typically they are just looking
for software things, not talking
about website or site specific

179
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:58,792
vulnerabilities. The reason they
do this is they use this
information they buy up

180
00:16:58,792 --> 00:17:03,458
information to either provide to
their customers as an alerting
service or bill it in to their

181
00:17:03,458 --> 00:17:07,042
products so that their products
are finding vulnerabilities that
other products may not know

182
00:17:07,042 --> 00:17:12,958
about that is sort of reasoning
incentive in most cases for
doing it. Then almost all cases

183
00:17:12,958 --> 00:17:17,750
reporting and coordination is
directly handled with that
company running the bounty and

184
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:22,750
you're not talking to the direct
software manufacturer company
that you found the issue in. So,

185
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:29,208
ZDI it's probably one that most
people are aware of or if you're
getting in this space,

186
00:17:29,208 --> 00:17:36,042
definitely look in to, they were
founded in 2005 this is their
10th year of doing that, so

187
00:17:36,042 --> 00:17:42,875
kudos to ZDI for really being
strong in this area. And they
focus again on software used by

188
00:17:42,875 --> 00:17:48,917
global enterprises, right? The
list of what they will pay for
is not published anywhere so

189
00:17:48,917 --> 00:17:55,750
it's not super clear what you
should research in many cases
but you can look at the upcoming

190
00:17:55,750 --> 00:18:03,333
advisories and get a feel for
what they have done in the past
and what is coming up, to sort

191
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:09,792
of understand what platforms and
types of bugs that they would
pay for. Couple quick points for

192
00:18:09,792 --> 00:18:14,750
them, there's over 3,000
independent researchers that are
registered with them, nearly 100

193
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:20,042
companies represented, U.S.,
U.K., India, Germany and France
are the top five countries. They

194
00:18:20,042 --> 00:18:26,500
didn't share with us the amount
of unique researchers that have
been paid. But we -- with

195
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:32,833
working with them and seeing
some other things they have paid
out 1,715 bounties, average

196
00:18:32,833 --> 00:18:40,417
bounty again they weren't
willing to share. But ZDI has
paid bounty ranges from three

197
00:18:40,417 --> 00:18:45,875
figures to six figures they have
paid some serious money for
vulnerabilities as well. And one

198
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:51,292
of the things that they also do
they have sort of extra rewards
and extra money if you're a

199
00:18:51,292 --> 00:18:55,750
repeat customer. If you are
loyal to them and repeating
things over and over you can get

200
00:18:55,750 --> 00:19:01,917
cash bonuses, you can get Balta
conferences, all those sorts of
things, right? So there are

201
00:19:01,917 --> 00:19:07,917
extra rewards if you send a lot
of things to them. All right.
I-defense the VCP program,

202
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:15,875
Carsten mentioned that as one of
the first ones out there, 2002
we're not really sure if they

203
00:19:15,875 --> 00:19:21,875
exist anymore to be quite frank.
There has been nothing published
since October 2013 timeframe and

204
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:30,917
most people that we sort of
talked to about if they're using
them or not are starting to say,

205
00:19:30,917 --> 00:19:34,042
don't bother, don't waste your
time. Information about them is
on their site if you want to

206
00:19:34,042 --> 00:19:37,750
look in to it feel free. Share
with us if you get anywhere with
them. Another one that we want

207
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:43,792
to mention, Exodus intelligence
they were born out of the ZDI
program and to be quite frank

208
00:19:43,792 --> 00:19:49,375
not too much is known about this
program yet as well. They came
out and announced some things

209
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:55,333
about the program but we haven't
seen a whole lot with it. They
talk about targeting again sort

210
00:19:55,333 --> 00:20:00,708
of critical vulnerabilities and
issues and widespread software.
It's unknown the number of

211
00:20:00,708 --> 00:20:05,750
bounties they've done they
weren't willing to disclose
that. It's unknown, they weren't

212
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:09,458
willing to disclose the number
of researchers that are
participating but if you look on

213
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:14,500
their site about what they're up
to they say their going to
intend to be competitive and

214
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:18,750
they also say there is yearly
bonuses for the top four
researchers of 20 grand each,

215
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:22,958
again, it's unclear we don't
have any evidence of what's been
going -- or what they have been

216
00:20:22,958 --> 00:20:28,875
doing but something to look in
to if you're in this space as
well. Contact them for details.

217
00:20:31,375 --> 00:20:35,250
>> Just some quick pointers if
you want to try to call some of
these third party companies a

218
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:40,792
lot of these pointers actually
go for the company run bounties
as well. First of all make sure

219
00:20:40,792 --> 00:20:44,500
you are clear on what software
they are likely to accept as
Jake said look at -- for

220
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:48,875
instance with CDI -- look at
what they publish, look at what
they have upcoming to figure

221
00:20:48,875 --> 00:20:54,250
out. When you report
vulnerabilities to them also
make sure that when you report

222
00:20:54,250 --> 00:21:00,083
them as cases, create a case for
each separate distinct
vulnerability. Not attack basis

223
00:21:00,083 --> 00:21:04,833
but for root causes. One of the
reasons you want to do this is
because if you sent a case where

224
00:21:04,833 --> 00:21:08,917
you just kind of bundle
everything in that's a risk that
they might not completely

225
00:21:08,917 --> 00:21:12,750
understand that you're reporting
X amount of separate
vulnerabilities so the offers

226
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:16,625
that they will give to you would
be for one vulnerability and
then you'll have to start

227
00:21:16,625 --> 00:21:19,292
discussing with them that hey,
there are this many
vulnerabilities shouldn't it be

228
00:21:19,292 --> 00:21:23,167
a higher amount? So, if you
create one per case it will make
it easier for them and it will

229
00:21:23,167 --> 00:21:25,375
make it easier for you and it
will increase your chance of
actually getting paid probably.

230
00:21:25,375 --> 00:21:30,625
When it comes to providing up
and providing information to
them make sure you include as

231
00:21:30,625 --> 00:21:35,042
many confirmed details as
possible. Don't do any guesswork
cause that will just confuse

232
00:21:35,042 --> 00:21:41,083
them especially if you are very
long. Trim down to make it easy.
The reason you want to provide

233
00:21:41,083 --> 00:21:45,875
all this information to them is
again, to help yourself. Because
the more detailed information

234
00:21:45,875 --> 00:21:51,333
you provide to them the clear,
cleaner your PUCs and exploits
are the easier it is for them

235
00:21:51,333 --> 00:21:55,750
once they start validating your
findings to quickly do it then
you get paid quicker and also

236
00:21:55,750 --> 00:22:01,500
less confusion about it. Make
sure to clearly list the
software that you tested. And

237
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:05,583
since they are confirming your
findings make sure you actually
provide references -- links to

238
00:22:05,583 --> 00:22:10,250
where you obtained the trial
software if you did, or where
they can at least find it. That

239
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:16,917
will also save you time and make
sure the whole process goes
much, much smoother. Next thing

240
00:22:16,917 --> 00:22:22,417
we want to talk about are the
crowd sourced bounties. And when
we talk about crowd source

241
00:22:22,417 --> 00:22:26,917
bounties we're talking about all
these portals we seen jump up,
all these platforms that have

242
00:22:26,917 --> 00:22:31,667
all these researchers tied to
them then companies instead of
creating their own bounty

243
00:22:31,667 --> 00:22:37,083
program they can come and use
this portal to quickly set up to
their liking, to get things

244
00:22:37,083 --> 00:22:41,375
done. What happens is all these
bounties will be open to
researchers, some of them will

245
00:22:41,375 --> 00:22:47,625
be open, some of them will be
private, but a lot of them will
be open to you. And then the way

246
00:22:47,625 --> 00:22:52,708
it works is that you send your
submission through this portal
then it's being passed on to the

247
00:22:52,708 --> 00:22:57,917
companies to make sure to get
stuff fixed, all the payment all
that stuff will happen through

248
00:22:57,917 --> 00:23:05,667
the portal also. What we are
seeing is this blur between the
traditional bug bounties and Pen

249
00:23:05,667 --> 00:23:10,208
testing, so Jake was talking
earlier about being an
independent Pen tester and how

250
00:23:10,208 --> 00:23:14,375
you have to do all this work,
well some of these new platforms
actually make it a bit easier,

251
00:23:14,375 --> 00:23:18,875
at least cutting out the sales
process because you can sign up
for these programs or get

252
00:23:18,875 --> 00:23:25,417
invited to participate in them.
Bug Crowd is one of the first
ones we want to discuss it was

253
00:23:25,417 --> 00:23:31,917
founded in 2012. The targets are
web, mobile, client side
embedded applications, the

254
00:23:31,917 --> 00:23:36,417
reason you also introduced Flex
which is a crowd source
penetration test. Currently we

255
00:23:36,417 --> 00:23:43,208
wrote this they have 23 public,
currently active programs. They
then had a number of private

256
00:23:43,208 --> 00:23:48,833
programs also that you have to
be invited for. They have had
170 programs that they completed

257
00:23:48,833 --> 00:23:54,833
so far and since October 2013
they have had around 57
companies participating. From

258
00:23:57,250 --> 00:24:01,625
research perspective they have
over 10,000 researchers that
have signed up for this service,

259
00:24:01,625 --> 00:24:04,792
so they definitely have the
largest researcher base with
varying quality from different

260
00:24:04,792 --> 00:24:10,833
countries. But if you look at
the number of unique researchers
that have been paid money it's

261
00:24:10,833 --> 00:24:16,833
only 231 researchers. There
might be a lot of researchers we
don't know how many necessarily

262
00:24:19,333 --> 00:24:26,250
are very active. The sign-up
process is very easy, basically
just go to the sign-up page,

263
00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:30,958
find user name, e-mail address,
password, boom you're in you can
start signing up to the

264
00:24:30,958 --> 00:24:36,250
different programs and start
finding vulnerabilities and then
report them. It's an easy

265
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:42,917
process. If we looked at the
number of bugs they have been
handling a bit more than a

266
00:24:42,917 --> 00:24:49,667
thousand bugs since November
2012. The average bounty amount
is around 250 U.S. dollars Pay

267
00:24:49,667 --> 00:24:54,958
out is primarily through PayPal
but have been made exceptions
with Western Union and some

268
00:24:54,958 --> 00:25:00,500
other options. The average time
to process of submission is
between two to six weeks but

269
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:07,292
generally seems to go pretty
fast. The largest single payout
has been $13,500 so there's

270
00:25:07,292 --> 00:25:13,375
still some significant amounts
also. And locations with
interest -- we talk again about

271
00:25:13,375 --> 00:25:18,208
the locations and again most of
the researchers here seem to be
from India, Europe and the

272
00:25:18,208 --> 00:25:24,750
eastern part of U.S. They also
have this leader board where you
can actually see who is doing

273
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:29,125
the best at the moment. Well you
can kind of see -- they provide
-- there's at least different

274
00:25:29,125 --> 00:25:32,542
options you can get kudos
points, you can get rewards,
it's up to the different

275
00:25:32,542 --> 00:25:37,458
companies that participate in
this program what they want to
provide. You can see -- some

276
00:25:37,458 --> 00:25:41,583
people like all these kudos
points but again that's also a
lot of people that aren't happy

277
00:25:41,583 --> 00:25:44,708
about it. Again as we've said if
you are going to do this
professionally, we don't really

278
00:25:44,708 --> 00:25:48,583
care about the kudos we care
about the cash. There are some
people that are complaining that

279
00:25:48,583 --> 00:25:55,208
too many of the programs that
are currently active do not have
actually monetary rewards.

280
00:25:55,208 --> 00:25:59,417
People are going after Bug Crowd
for it but really end of day
they shouldn't be faulted for it

281
00:25:59,417 --> 00:26:02,917
because they just provide the
options and it's up to the
companies that use them to what

282
00:26:02,917 --> 00:26:07,458
they want to choose. So it's
really the companies. And again,
if you are a charity then as a

283
00:26:07,458 --> 00:26:12,208
researcher, yeah, I might invest
some of my time to find some
vulnerabilities and do it for

284
00:26:12,208 --> 00:26:18,125
kudos. But if you are a security
company that has just received a
ton of VC money, for me as a

285
00:26:18,125 --> 00:26:23,208
researcher it's fucking
offensive when all you want to
give me is a thank you for

286
00:26:23,208 --> 00:26:29,208
finding vulnerabilities on your
site. [Applause] The next one we
want to talk about is HackerOne.

287
00:26:33,375 --> 00:26:39,667
It was founded 2013. Their
targets are a bit different
because they are different

288
00:26:39,667 --> 00:26:44,208
response teams handling things.
It can really be focused on
whatever these response teams

289
00:26:44,208 --> 00:26:49,708
want to get handled, currently
63 different teams that run
public programs on HackerOne

290
00:26:49,708 --> 00:26:54,958
then there's a lot of private
programs. That you have to be
invited for. They say they have

291
00:26:54,958 --> 00:27:00,333
thousands of researchers that
are registered and around 800
have submitted valid findings

292
00:27:00,333 --> 00:27:04,875
that either lead to a bounty or
some sort of recognition we
don't have the exact number of

293
00:27:04,875 --> 00:27:12,667
people that have actually been
paid. 800 have either received
recognition or money. Sign up

294
00:27:12,667 --> 00:27:18,500
here is also very easy, name,
username, password, boom you're
in, and you can actually start

295
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:24,500
working immediately in finding
stuff. They have paid more than
1300 bug bounties. The average

296
00:27:26,708 --> 00:27:32,708
bounty amount is almost $700.
Largest pay off has been $15,000
they have had multiple of those.

297
00:27:36,417 --> 00:27:41,125
One of them was the incident bug
bounty that they're running was
paid for Heart Bleed. We all

298
00:27:41,125 --> 00:27:48,958
know and heard about. Other ones
were Yahoo! have been paying out
15,000 bug bounties also, so

299
00:27:48,958 --> 00:27:55,167
that's also some serious cash
there. Usually bug bounties one
that is pretty interesting

300
00:27:55,167 --> 00:28:00,708
because they cover different
technologies, if you find
vulnerabilities in products like

301
00:28:00,708 --> 00:28:06,667
PhP, pearl, Jango, you can
actually report vulnerabilities.
They also have an Internet

302
00:28:06,667 --> 00:28:09,875
bounty where if you find
vulnerabilities in other
components that are considered

303
00:28:09,875 --> 00:28:14,208
critical to the internet like
for instance Heart Bleed you can
actually get paid as well. The

304
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:19,958
minimum bounty here in this case
is $5,000 U.S. Also have a
different version called the

305
00:28:19,958 --> 00:28:26,417
sandbox escape where if you find
a vulnerability in chrome, other
browsers like Internet Explorer,

306
00:28:26,417 --> 00:28:33,125
or Adobe reader find sandbox
escape you can get paid through
this program. So you can report

307
00:28:33,125 --> 00:28:39,917
the vulnerabilities to Adobe and
pass it on to these guys also
and again minimum payout is

308
00:28:39,917 --> 00:28:45,250
$5,000. Another one we want to
discuss is CrowdCurity also
found in 2013. Their focus is on

309
00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:51,208
web applications and usually
things that are Bitcoin related.
Currently they have 45 active

310
00:28:51,208 --> 00:28:58,375
bounties they have run around 90
programs all time and companies
in the 50s to 100 range have

311
00:28:58,375 --> 00:29:04,375
used the platform they have 1300
researchers signed up and around
3-400 of them are actually

312
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:10,917
considered active. The most
predominant research again is
from India, Europe and U.S.

313
00:29:10,917 --> 00:29:17,292
around 100 unique researchers
have been paid so far. Signing
up here is again also very easy

314
00:29:17,292 --> 00:29:23,083
like the other programs, quick
details and you're in and you
can start immediately. They pay

315
00:29:23,083 --> 00:29:30,083
around 800 bucks. Average bug
bounty is $150 they do bit
differently they provide package

316
00:29:30,083 --> 00:29:35,875
options to the customers and
then they can decide what they
want so we are not seeing the

317
00:29:35,875 --> 00:29:40,542
same big ranges that we do for
some of the other programs. The
largest single payment has been

318
00:29:40,542 --> 00:29:48,500
$1500 here. CrowdCurity is also
doing the hall of fame stuff but
what we can talk about there is

319
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:53,333
their approach is that they also
show report qualities actually
going for researchers and you

320
00:29:53,333 --> 00:29:59,917
can see the report qualities how
good it is not just the kudos
points. Last one we want to

321
00:29:59,917 --> 00:30:06,917
discuss is Sinagh founded in
2013. It's actually not a
managed bug bounty provider as

322
00:30:06,917 --> 00:30:10,750
such more focusing on
application vulnerabilities
across web, mobile,

323
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:17,250
infrastructure, really this sort
of penetration test approach
where as a researcher you sign

324
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:23,417
up, it's not as easy we'll cove
that. And then you get paid per
vulnerability you find, so

325
00:30:23,417 --> 00:30:28,000
instead of being paid for just
doing an engagement you get paid
for showing results. They didn't

326
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:33,958
share a lot of details with us
so we don't know how many
clients they have we don't know

327
00:30:33,958 --> 00:30:38,500
how many researchers they have,
we know that around 40% of them
are U.S. based though the rest

328
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:44,917
are international. That is it.
The application process is
challenging, it's invite only.

329
00:30:44,917 --> 00:30:48,042
So when you sign up you have to
provide them with a lot of
information, you have to kind of

330
00:30:48,042 --> 00:30:51,750
make them understand why you
deserve to be in this program,
how many years of experience

331
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:55,958
have you had, et cetera, once
you fill out the process form
they will actually schedule a

332
00:30:55,958 --> 00:31:01,167
call with you. Like a 30-minute
call where you can talk to them,
explain your background so they

333
00:31:01,167 --> 00:31:06,375
can figure out whether you are
fit for this platform. They do a
lot of research compared to the

334
00:31:06,375 --> 00:31:12,375
other programs. Again number of
pay outs, unknown bounty amount,
average is unknown. They have

335
00:31:17,333 --> 00:31:20,583
shared with us the payout range
is between $100 U.S. dollars to
$5,000. There's no upper limit

336
00:31:20,583 --> 00:31:27,875
but that's the range of what you
should expect to get paid per
issue you find. So some pointers

337
00:31:27,875 --> 00:31:32,792
when you report to these crowd
source programs it's actually a
bit different. Because the risk

338
00:31:32,792 --> 00:31:38,250
of duplicates for these programs
is much higher than for some of
the other programs. So speed is

339
00:31:38,250 --> 00:31:43,250
a much, much bigger factor. If
you sit down and take the third
party program approach for

340
00:31:43,250 --> 00:31:47,250
instance, where you sit down,
you write up a very nice report,
you want it all to be clear, you

341
00:31:47,250 --> 00:31:51,667
send it in to them, like I wrote
this amazing report then you
know what, someone just beat you

342
00:31:51,667 --> 00:31:55,125
to it because there are so many
other people looking at it and
they only pay the first person

343
00:31:55,125 --> 00:32:00,792
that find it so all you get out
of it is kudos for your hard
work. So instead, what you

344
00:32:00,792 --> 00:32:04,917
should do in this case is when
you find a vulnerability, don't
just like collect them and then

345
00:32:04,917 --> 00:32:09,833
report eventually. Get them out
immediately, quick sheet quick
description just send it out

346
00:32:09,833 --> 00:32:14,583
obviously you want some level of
detail but just something quick
so you can make sure that you

347
00:32:14,583 --> 00:32:18,250
increase your chances of being
the first one that actually gets
the money. What we really do

348
00:32:18,250 --> 00:32:24,167
like about many of these
programs though and encourage
you do, a lot of them provide a

349
00:32:24,167 --> 00:32:30,000
heads up on upcoming bounties so
they will say we have this new
one that will launch. So you can

350
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:35,458
actually sit and be ready for
it. As soon as that program goes
live you can be away hacking

351
00:32:35,458 --> 00:32:40,792
immediately that allows you to
quicker find some of the low
hanging fruit also, get it

352
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:44,500
reported quickly and increase
your chance of getting paid.
Because if you get in late on

353
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:50,333
those as we have been talking
about, hundreds of researchers
on most of them, then a lot of

354
00:32:50,333 --> 00:32:53,750
people have already been looking
at it and there's a good chance
they find it. When I was using

355
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:57,167
some of these programs also if
you get in late just to find it
you might find a vulnerability,

356
00:32:57,167 --> 00:33:00,583
you go oh yeah that's good. You
write it up, report, you send it
off quick, the thing is someone

357
00:33:00,583 --> 00:33:05,500
already found it just hasn't
been fixed yet. Waste of time, 2
kudos points, yey. So, Jake will

358
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:15,458
now cover progress, some better
approaches, a different category
something you might want to do

359
00:33:15,458 --> 00:33:21,458
and look at instead. >> All
right. So, bug brokers, what are
we talking about. Basically a

360
00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:30,458
researcher who finds a
vulnerability, works with a
broker and that broker will then

361
00:33:30,458 --> 00:33:35,500
find the best market and the
best price for that information.
This could be a number of

362
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:40,667
avenues including grey and black
markets. Its generally still
thought of as the way to get the

363
00:33:40,667 --> 00:33:47,708
most amount of money possible
for your research. And almost
all cases, the reporting and the

364
00:33:47,708 --> 00:33:53,875
coordination is directly handled
with the broker, who handles
everything about that

365
00:33:53,875 --> 00:33:59,167
transaction and details of the
vulnerability are typically
never published. A lot of the

366
00:33:59,167 --> 00:34:05,417
other areas, the terms and
agreement may vary by program
but at some point you make get a

367
00:34:05,417 --> 00:34:10,625
little credit and go through the
disclosure process, in this case
usually it's not discussed at

368
00:34:10,625 --> 00:34:18,292
all as you can imagine. So one
of the places we looked at that
does brokering is a company

369
00:34:18,292 --> 00:34:24,292
called Beyond Security, has a
team they call secure team, they
have the secure team secured

370
00:34:40,625 --> 00:34:43,208
disclosure it's not a purchasing
program but if you have a
vulnerability of interest that

371
00:34:43,208 --> 00:34:46,083
is critical or something that
they care about they will look
at it. They weren't willing to

372
00:34:46,083 --> 00:34:49,167
share a lot of information with
us as you can imagine so we
don't know the number of

373
00:34:49,167 --> 00:34:52,250
researchers, we don't know how
many unique ones have been paid
but we were able to find from

374
00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:55,000
them that they had researchers
in all continents, except for
Africa and most are U.S. and

375
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,875
Europe. Here is where it gets
interesting. They shared with us
that over 100 bounties were paid

376
00:34:57,875 --> 00:35:01,500
last year, if you look at the
average amount they're saying
that the bounties were between

377
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:06,625
five and 100,000. And they
shared with us and claimed that
the largest single pay out that

378
00:35:06,625 --> 00:35:10,375
they had was over $1 million.
You're talking about some
serious money. When we shared

379
00:35:10,375 --> 00:35:16,625
this with several people we got
a lot of people say bull shit we
don't believe it, so there is

380
00:35:16,625 --> 00:35:21,958
that, but from working with
them, they're claiming that this
is legit that they have had over

381
00:35:21,958 --> 00:35:27,583
a million dollar pay out. A
little bit of a different
approach because again, it still

382
00:35:27,583 --> 00:35:33,250
does take time to report issues
and disclosure process, Secunia
had created a program that

383
00:35:33,250 --> 00:35:39,250
coordinate quite some time ago
was in the end of 2011, they
weren't actually willing to

384
00:35:39,250 --> 00:35:45,292
really pay you anything, but
they would get you to a
conference and that sort of

385
00:35:45,292 --> 00:35:52,833
thing. But it was really just an
offer to help get things fixed
and be that broker for you. But

386
00:35:52,833 --> 00:35:58,500
what's interesting is this
service is closed for business.
Rest in peace August 2013. And

387
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:06,417
really what came out of it was
just again shows that there's a
lot of work when it goes in to

388
00:36:06,417 --> 00:36:12,042
disclosure process that they
ended it basically saying that
the amount of time and effort

389
00:36:12,042 --> 00:36:18,458
just wasn't worth it to the
organization this is now no
longer an option. You just can't

390
00:36:18,458 --> 00:36:24,583
talk about brokering without
this guy, everyone know who this
guy is? The Grook? Right? He's

391
00:36:24,583 --> 00:36:30,083
got a lot to say on this topic
if you're interested, if you
want to hear his thoughts he's

392
00:36:30,083 --> 00:36:34,708
talked a lot about it, contact
him I'm sure he'd be willing to
share more and talk to you about

393
00:36:34,708 --> 00:36:40,708
information. >> We could go on
to discuss bug bounties, is it
worth your time and some of the

394
00:36:44,417 --> 00:36:51,458
considerations you should make.
You wanted to do reality check
before starting out. When I

395
00:36:51,458 --> 00:36:56,458
eventually left Secuina and
actually a couple years before I
left I was toying with the idea

396
00:36:56,458 --> 00:37:01,833
of going full time as bug bounty
hunter actually wanted to do it
both myself and my family to

397
00:37:01,833 --> 00:37:05,875
Thailand and do it down there.
I'll cover a bit later why that
was part of the consideration.

398
00:37:05,875 --> 00:37:11,542
But before doing all this you
want to do as I said reality
check, ask yourself a couple of

399
00:37:11,542 --> 00:37:17,542
questions. The first one, how
much money would I need per
month to stay afloat. If you

400
00:37:20,167 --> 00:37:24,875
have a house a mortgage, a car,
wife and kid to take care of in
Denmark your expenses could be a

401
00:37:24,875 --> 00:37:29,375
lot higher than if you're single
in Thailand. Depending on how
you spend your free time down

402
00:37:29,375 --> 00:37:34,333
there. [Laughter] The reason I
mentioned Denmark versus
Thailand is because location

403
00:37:34,333 --> 00:37:40,333
actually matters. These are some
quick stats from -- most of them
are from sourced from a website

404
00:37:43,667 --> 00:37:50,750
called pay scale that shows
average salaries a year for Pen
Testers and it covers everything

405
00:37:50,750 --> 00:37:55,333
from like the new junior guy
that just started to the very
senior guys. Obviously if you

406
00:37:55,333 --> 00:37:59,083
are in former category you'll be
earning less than these amounts.
If you're in the latter category

407
00:37:59,083 --> 00:38:05,083
you might earn twice as much.
The point is that salary is also
followed by expenses. If I'm

408
00:38:05,083 --> 00:38:12,458
sitting in Thailand and the
average salary down there is say
$15,000, $10-$15,000 U.S. a

409
00:38:12,458 --> 00:38:18,667
year. I don't have to find a lot
of vulnerabilities to make that
happen quite quick yeah. If I'm

410
00:38:18,667 --> 00:38:26,125
sitting in Denmark and the
average salary is 100k -- takes
a lot more effort. So, this is

411
00:38:26,125 --> 00:38:30,208
part of the thought process also
if it doesn't make sense
financially for me to start

412
00:38:30,208 --> 00:38:36,250
doing this. If you are in a
lower income country they'll
have low expenses, stay away

413
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:39,667
from Iran and some of those
countries they have embargoed a
lot of these programs that

414
00:38:39,667 --> 00:38:47,542
actually won't pay you, so you
move down there for no reason.
So then we kind of have the idea

415
00:38:47,542 --> 00:38:52,292
now we know how much money do I
need to stay afloat, have a
comfortable life. Obviously we

416
00:38:52,292 --> 00:38:56,583
want to do this to have a
comfortable life unless then
it's no fun. The next question

417
00:38:56,583 --> 00:39:01,167
you want to ask yourself, ok
what is the combination of
products, vulnerability type

418
00:39:01,167 --> 00:39:06,583
numbers that I look at to make
it happen. This is where we talk
skill set also. If you are a

419
00:39:06,583 --> 00:39:11,750
hard core reverser and you can
make bad ass exploits, well then
you will usually be in category

420
00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:17,250
where you can find
vulnerabilities that can be sold
for more and then you might find

421
00:39:17,250 --> 00:39:22,833
it easier to have these numbers
that you have for yourself. If
you have a skill set that is

422
00:39:22,833 --> 00:39:26,583
restricted to finding process
scripting on websites, well then
you need to find more

423
00:39:26,583 --> 00:39:30,000
vulnerabilities. What we like
about bug bounties is the fact
that there are options for

424
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:34,042
everyone. Just depends then of
how many vulnerabilities you
have to find to hit these

425
00:39:34,042 --> 00:39:39,333
targets. We see some researchers
that find a few vulnerabilities
and some high profile people get

426
00:39:39,333 --> 00:39:45,208
paid a ton of money, the
competition we talked about,
other researchers that focus on

427
00:39:45,208 --> 00:39:49,917
other programs, guy that is
worth mentioning is Argod, he's
been using CDI for like four

428
00:39:49,917 --> 00:39:54,958
years or so, and in that time
he's found 200 vulnerabilities.
Then you do the math there that

429
00:39:54,958 --> 00:39:59,458
he's been making a good living
off of that and sticking to, I
call it lower hanging fruit but

430
00:39:59,458 --> 00:40:03,042
he's been keeping clear of all
the big -- not finding
vulnerabilities in Internet

431
00:40:03,042 --> 00:40:07,083
Explorer, he's keeping it to HP
products and some other IBM
products that not many people

432
00:40:07,083 --> 00:40:13,083
are looking at and doing it very
successfully. Part of this
process is also again figuring

433
00:40:15,958 --> 00:40:21,292
out the numbers or to figuring
out, how much will I get paid,
so kind of make a plan there. If

434
00:40:21,292 --> 00:40:26,083
you decide, okay, I'm going to
hit these numbers and hit Yahoo!
hard find a lot of

435
00:40:26,083 --> 00:40:30,292
vulnerabilities, you report a
lot of scripting vulnerabilities
to them and then they say thank

436
00:40:30,292 --> 00:40:35,625
you here is a $12.50 voucher for
your trouble. This happens, I
see some of you laughing so you

437
00:40:35,625 --> 00:40:40,708
know. This actually happened for
a security company that wanted
to test it, so this is also why

438
00:40:40,708 --> 00:40:44,917
Yahoo! actually changed the
policies. So now if you report
some vulnerabilities to them you

439
00:40:44,917 --> 00:40:49,958
can get up to 15K right? So, now
it's interesting. That's another
one of the offensive ones. Now

440
00:40:49,958 --> 00:40:56,875
we know how much money do I
need, and we also know like how
do we want to make this happen.

441
00:40:56,875 --> 00:41:03,208
Then your last conclusion, how
much time will I need to invest
in this. One of the great things

442
00:41:03,208 --> 00:41:07,208
about being a professional bug
bounty hunter is of course the
freedom that's involved. So,

443
00:41:07,208 --> 00:41:12,000
again if you are living
somewhere where you only have to
find very little small number of

444
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:19,167
vulnerabilities to make it
happen, great. Maybe you spent a
few hours a day, a day a week

445
00:41:19,167 --> 00:41:24,000
you can make these numbers,
right? But if you have to find a
ton of vulnerabilities to make

446
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,958
this happen you are living in
high income country with a lot
of expenses if you have to work

447
00:41:27,958 --> 00:41:32,458
60 plus hours a week, all of a
sudden it's not very fun, is it.
Then you might want to ask

448
00:41:32,458 --> 00:41:36,667
yourself, well is it worth it?
Of course if you have to spend
that much time to make it happen

449
00:41:36,667 --> 00:41:41,208
you're also increasing the risk
of it not working out for you.
Again, those are three good

450
00:41:41,208 --> 00:41:48,125
questions. And all the questions
I was asking myself when I was
considering this. All these

451
00:41:48,125 --> 00:41:53,000
questions then as I said led you
to conclude bug bounty hunting,
is that the career path for me

452
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:57,500
or should I keep it as a hobby
on the side? Again most
important part is, if you don't

453
00:41:57,500 --> 00:42:03,167
form some sort of plan from the
beginning and figure out how you
want to get these numbers, what

454
00:42:03,167 --> 00:42:08,625
you're going to focus on, there
is very small chance it will
work out for you in the long

455
00:42:08,625 --> 00:42:12,583
run. Again, if you have to
generate a thousand dollars a
month and you're living in

456
00:42:12,583 --> 00:42:18,333
India, Thailand, great. That's
pretty easy. If you have to
generate 10,000 a month it gets

457
00:42:18,333 --> 00:42:24,333
harder. So, Jake will then
finish off by discussing bug
bounties and what we think is to

458
00:42:27,208 --> 00:42:33,583
come. >> All right. A little
pressed on time because a lot of
content we want to cover so

459
00:42:33,583 --> 00:42:37,750
we're going to go over a few of
these things. The good news for
anyone that is a bug bounty

460
00:42:37,750 --> 00:42:43,250
hunter or wants to be, software
is still complete shit right now
and so there's lots of things to

461
00:42:43,250 --> 00:42:47,167
find, right? If you look at
these numbers from the OSPD
project where we track

462
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:51,750
vulnerabilities we're seeing
10,000 vulms a year it doesn't
seem to be slowing down, this

463
00:42:51,750 --> 00:42:56,542
also does not include any of the
site specific vulnerabilities
and websites, right. You're

464
00:42:56,542 --> 00:43:02,083
talking about a lot of options
out there. We think that the
rules and requirements will

465
00:43:02,083 --> 00:43:08,125
start being enhanced a bit more
specifically when people are
going after cloud services,

466
00:43:08,125 --> 00:43:13,750
right? You start trying to do
allegedly good bounty hunting on
a software as a service and you

467
00:43:13,750 --> 00:43:18,125
wipe it out, the company is not
going to be real happy about
that, right. Be real careful of

468
00:43:18,125 --> 00:43:22,292
that we think there will be more
and more clarity that comes in
that space. Legal threats,

469
00:43:22,292 --> 00:43:28,083
right. They still happen for
those in the room that have been
around for awhile know this you

470
00:43:28,083 --> 00:43:33,208
think back to 2005 the Cisco
versus Mike Lynn most people
say, we remember that, but

471
00:43:33,208 --> 00:43:38,333
things have gotten so much
better. In many ways they have,
right. But legal threats are

472
00:43:38,333 --> 00:43:43,792
still happening and they are
still successful so you still
want to keep in mind with what

473
00:43:43,792 --> 00:43:48,583
you're up to and be smart.
Specifically there's a big
difference between a bug bounty

474
00:43:48,583 --> 00:43:53,708
and this thing called extortion,
you want to be very careful. For
example, this guy, probable

475
00:43:53,708 --> 00:43:59,792
onion on Twitter he had a great
thing he contacts these guys
saying you have 12 hours to fix

476
00:43:59,792 --> 00:44:05,208
the vulnerability in your system
otherwise I will take control.
You've been warned, right? And

477
00:44:05,208 --> 00:44:10,208
then all of a sudden the company
comes back and says we'd be
happy to do a bug bounty on

478
00:44:10,208 --> 00:44:16,333
this. What the heck are you
talking about there? Not really
what the bug bounty program is

479
00:44:16,333 --> 00:44:21,167
set up for, right? Of course,
you would say this guy would
probably come back, he's

480
00:44:21,167 --> 00:44:26,583
interested in the money, okay,
let's talk. Be careful about
that because if you think about

481
00:44:26,583 --> 00:44:33,625
it we find out that a team was
arrested, right, this guy was a
team from Canada was arrested

482
00:44:33,625 --> 00:44:37,875
for doing things like this and
swatting people like Crebs and
all kinds of other things so --

483
00:44:37,875 --> 00:44:44,042
the bounty stuff and vendors are
now willing to work with you and
pay money but let's not get in

484
00:44:44,042 --> 00:44:48,125
to -- be very careful about this
whole extortion area, right.
From a researcher's standpoint,

485
00:44:48,125 --> 00:44:52,958
it's great now that companies
are willing to pay money, right,
so we want to let researchers

486
00:44:52,958 --> 00:44:57,500
know this should be something
that we should be appreciating
the fact that they're willing to

487
00:44:57,500 --> 00:45:02,875
pay and not sort of this sense
of entitlement. So many people
will just go out there and pick

488
00:45:02,875 --> 00:45:07,167
a random website and start
messing around with it and then
demand payment. When that

489
00:45:07,167 --> 00:45:11,417
company never asked you to do
that. It's uncommissioned work,
right? So definitely there's a

490
00:45:11,417 --> 00:45:15,958
lot of companies out there,
there's a lot of ways we
describe that are willing that

491
00:45:15,958 --> 00:45:21,375
have said they will pay, stick
with those. You don't need to go
out there. We do have Google

492
00:45:21,375 --> 00:45:26,042
again, now they launched this
new thing called project zero if
you've heard about it basically

493
00:45:26,042 --> 00:45:31,458
creating a dream team of
researchers to weed out bugs in
popular software. We believe at

494
00:45:31,458 --> 00:45:35,792
this point it might not have
issues on websites, but on other
software bits we think it's

495
00:45:35,792 --> 00:45:42,208
going to make it a lot harder
and raise the bar for it. And
we're already seeing people

496
00:45:42,208 --> 00:45:48,125
trying to calculate the ROI and
what is going on in that space
of what's worth it. Wrapping it

497
00:45:48,125 --> 00:45:53,292
up here, more and more companies
are going to jump on board with
bug bounties programs, we

498
00:45:53,292 --> 00:45:57,792
ultimately think that kudos and
karma stuff is nice but it's
going to lose out to where the

499
00:45:57,792 --> 00:46:02,375
biggest amount of money is. We
believe that while companies are
going to continue to have bug

500
00:46:02,375 --> 00:46:05,958
bounty programs as part of their
security programs that they're
going to realize that

501
00:46:05,958 --> 00:46:10,042
eradicating vulms early on
during the SDL process still is
a cheaper, better way so we're

502
00:46:10,042 --> 00:46:14,792
going to see some shifting. With
that, this presentation would
not have been possible with a

503
00:46:14,792 --> 00:46:19,458
lot of people we want to thank
Brian Martin, Katie from
HackerOne, Nate from Facebook,

504
00:46:19,458 --> 00:46:26,667
HP, ZDI, CrowdCury, Secure Team,
Kasey from Bug Crowd, all the
bug bounty hunters out there and

505
00:46:26,667 --> 00:46:32,583
future bug bounty hunters, thank
you. [Applause]
