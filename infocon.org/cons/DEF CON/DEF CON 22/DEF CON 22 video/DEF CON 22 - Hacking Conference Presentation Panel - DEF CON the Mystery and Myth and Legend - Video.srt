1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:06,500
>> Hi, my name is Mike and I'm a
noob. [ Laughter ] >> So I
really didn't know that this was

2
00:00:09,792 --> 00:00:16,917
going to be a two-hour panel.
I'm going to encourage everybody
else to try and participate so

3
00:00:16,917 --> 00:00:22,083
that I can fill the gaps, and
then explain to my wife why I'm
not giving her a call in an

4
00:00:22,083 --> 00:00:28,083
hour. You know, Tom brought up
some very important stuff. This
actually is kind of funny. He

5
00:00:34,917 --> 00:00:39,708
talked about how 101 has grown.
When I first came here, the
first time I came here, was

6
00:00:39,708 --> 00:00:47,625
because of Alex Rogan, and he
said I'm going to introduce you
to this real cool guy, Chris

7
00:00:47,625 --> 00:00:54,750
Hurley, who was war driving.
This was a decade ago, where
we're talking about, you know,

8
00:00:54,750 --> 00:01:01,708
cutting-edge wireless stuff with
him sitting in his Ford Mustang
driving around and then cussing

9
00:01:01,708 --> 00:01:07,708
at a reporter later because they
didn't report it properly. And
then Chris managed to rope me

10
00:01:10,083 --> 00:01:17,083
in, and said hey, I'm going to
run the vendor area, so can you
come and help me out and I did.

11
00:01:17,083 --> 00:01:23,458
And I've been here ever since.
And the one thing that was
always -- has always been cool

12
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:29,458
about this, as Tom leaves to go
to the bathroom, is exactly what
Tom said. You come here to

13
00:01:32,625 --> 00:01:37,708
learn. It's amazing that you can
come in here and stand in a room
or sit in a room or sit in a

14
00:01:37,708 --> 00:01:45,208
hallway with, you know, 5, 10,
20 people, and all of a sudden,
this just becomes a collective

15
00:01:45,208 --> 00:01:50,250
consciousness. Not everybody has
the same level of experience as
you, not everybody has the same

16
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:56,250
vision as you or maybe just the
same perspective, but it's
amazing how that can come about.

17
00:01:59,875 --> 00:02:04,792
That aside, DEF CON is also
about having a good time. It's
about coming out of your shell.

18
00:02:04,792 --> 00:02:09,083
It's about doing things. I know
that the original description of
this talked about the

19
00:02:09,083 --> 00:02:13,250
shenanigans. And there have been
shenanigans, and DEF CON has
grown. DEF CON has grown

20
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:20,625
significantly over the last --
well, over the last decade,
moving from the Alexis Park to

21
00:02:20,625 --> 00:02:26,958
here. I can remember when 2,000
people was a huge CON, and that
still meant you stood in line

22
00:02:26,958 --> 00:02:32,958
all the way around into the
parking lot of Alexis Park. For
some of us remembering the tent

23
00:02:35,125 --> 00:02:41,083
on the roof and how hot it was
and Hacker Jeopardy and Vinyl
Vanna probably very happy to be

24
00:02:41,083 --> 00:02:47,083
out of her clothes because it
was so hot. So with that, I'm
going to kind of turn it over to

25
00:02:49,083 --> 00:02:53,417
some of my friends to tell a
couple of stories. And we're
going to talk about the good

26
00:02:53,417 --> 00:02:59,375
times because the coming out of
your shell part really is the
most important part. A lot of

27
00:02:59,375 --> 00:03:04,167
people come here alone. I have a
friend who's here right now.
He's alone, and he's miserable,

28
00:03:04,167 --> 00:03:08,250
but it's because he's not
letting himself meet people.
He's not letting himself just

29
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:13,333
sit down and be himself and have
a conversation with people. And
it's a shame because now he's

30
00:03:13,333 --> 00:03:21,000
missing out on the rest of the
CON because not everybody gets
it. DC 101 is important because

31
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,417
it lets you learn. It puts you
in a position where you're
learning about stuff that you

32
00:03:26,417 --> 00:03:30,417
may not necessarily know, and
it's not hands-on. It's not a
workshop. That's where the

33
00:03:30,417 --> 00:03:34,542
villages are for. It's actually,
you know, where you can sit down
and you can start to get

34
00:03:34,542 --> 00:03:39,417
interested in something. You
attend a talk. If you were in
Dave Litchfield's talk about

35
00:03:39,417 --> 00:03:44,792
time-based-and this was a while
ago-time-based attacks on
databases. Unless you're Dave

36
00:03:44,792 --> 00:03:48,875
Litchfield or somebody at Dave
Litchfield's level, you don't
get it, so you're just sitting

37
00:03:48,875 --> 00:03:53,500
in the audience nodding your
head, going along. But
hopefully, it interests people

38
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:58,458
enough that they're going to at
least look it up and say, oh,
that's what time-based means. So

39
00:03:58,458 --> 00:04:05,417
with that, you know, do any of
you guys want to start it off,
tell stories, talk about, you

40
00:04:05,417 --> 00:04:11,417
know, the fun times, talk about
grass angels, maybe, or talk
about any other experiences?

41
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:20,500
Come on, raise your hand. I will
make you. There we go. Thank
you. Alex Rogan, people!

42
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:33,250
[Applause] >> Yeah, so my first
DEF CON was DEF CON 10. There's
a lot of cool stuff that went on

43
00:04:35,583 --> 00:04:40,208
at DEF CON 10. I'm going to try
to convince some other people to
talk about a couple of those.

44
00:04:40,208 --> 00:04:46,417
I'll talk about one of my most
fun times, which was at DEF CON
12, still at the Alexis Park,

45
00:04:46,417 --> 00:04:52,417
and we were walking as a
crowd-kind of stumbling as a
crowd -- moving back from, I

46
00:04:55,042 --> 00:05:00,542
think we were going back from
pool two back towards pool
three. I'm not sure. We had

47
00:05:00,542 --> 00:05:08,500
already had a few alcoholic
beverages at the Irvine
University or Irvine Underground

48
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:16,208
IVU party, and I was walking
with my, at the time girlfriend,
now wife, Jennifer, and I turned

49
00:05:16,208 --> 00:05:22,083
around for a second and turned
back, and she was gone. And so,
you know, all of my friends are

50
00:05:22,083 --> 00:05:27,250
there with me, and my at the
time girlfriend was not, so I
was a little nervous. So I

51
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:33,917
started looking around, calling
out for her and couldn't find
her. So I kind of turned a 360

52
00:05:33,917 --> 00:05:39,083
and said, well, let me just stop
here, look around, maybe I'm
going to track her like I'm some

53
00:05:39,083 --> 00:05:46,333
sort of a man-hunter tracker
thing. But I turned around, and
I see overlooking one of the

54
00:05:46,333 --> 00:05:52,333
upstairs rooms the window was
projecting Sealab 2021 from
Cartoon Network on there, and so

55
00:05:56,458 --> 00:06:02,833
we both really enjoyed it at the
time, so I said, I'm just going
to bet that she saw Sealab in

56
00:06:02,833 --> 00:06:07,375
the window and wanted to go up
and talk with people, because
she's a very friendly welcoming

57
00:06:07,375 --> 00:06:14,042
person, and she likes doing
things like that. So I go up to
the door as best I could tell

58
00:06:14,042 --> 00:06:18,875
from the window and knocked on
the door. A person opened the
door, and I said, hey, is my

59
00:06:18,875 --> 00:06:26,042
girlfriend in here? And he just
kind of looked, and he goes oh,
Jen, yeah, come on in, she's

60
00:06:26,042 --> 00:06:31,667
here in the back! And so they --
she went right in and was laying
on the floor with another young

61
00:06:31,667 --> 00:06:37,292
lady just watching Sealab,
having the best time in the
world, and so I'm like totally

62
00:06:37,292 --> 00:06:44,417
innocent, totally innocent,
nothing debaucherous going on or
anything, just two women

63
00:06:44,417 --> 00:06:50,083
watching Sealab together. Yeah,
and so I was talking to the guy
and I said, hey, listen I'm

64
00:06:50,083 --> 00:06:55,250
really sorry. I didn't mean to
disturb guys. They're having a
private party, and I didn't want

65
00:06:55,250 --> 00:07:00,750
to disturb. And he's like oh,
no, no, it's cool. And I
actually met the founders of

66
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:06,750
WiGLE.net, the database mapping
conglomerate for wireless access
points. I met Bobzilla and

67
00:07:08,792 --> 00:07:15,375
Arkasha that night, and it just
was the most random thing just
walking through DEF CON seeing

68
00:07:15,375 --> 00:07:21,375
people and losing my girlfriend
to the guys at WiGLE! But yeah,
I mean, we had a great time.

69
00:07:25,167 --> 00:07:31,167
I'll even do an addendum onto
that. So after we leave WiGLE,
we're walking back towards pool

70
00:07:33,208 --> 00:07:40,125
one, and I'm having a hard time
staying vertical at this
particular point. And I see --

71
00:07:40,125 --> 00:07:46,417
so Romer isn't here, but Romer
was talking with somebody that I
had been wanting to get a chance

72
00:07:46,417 --> 00:07:51,167
to talk to -- Andrew William. At
the time, he was the Vice
President of Publishing at

73
00:07:51,167 --> 00:07:56,417
Syngress. And I had actually,
after my first couple of DEF
CONs said, hey, I might actually

74
00:07:56,417 --> 00:08:01,542
have an idea for a book. You
know, maybe it's something, I
don't know, put together a

75
00:08:01,542 --> 00:08:07,917
little 30-second elevator pitch
so to speak for it, and walked
up just almost falling down

76
00:08:07,917 --> 00:08:14,125
drunk talking to Andrew Williams
by pool one. And it turns out
later on he was as drunk as I

77
00:08:14,125 --> 00:08:20,125
was, which was probably why he
wanted to listen to me, but I
got to stand there, and I had

78
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:25,458
his attention for five or six
minutes, and, you know, went
through my idea and my pitch,

79
00:08:25,458 --> 00:08:29,792
and he said, actually, that's a
pretty good idea. That's an
interesting perspective I

80
00:08:29,792 --> 00:08:35,125
haven't seen before, so yeah,
you know, here's my card. I'm
going to set up an email with

81
00:08:35,125 --> 00:08:42,000
you, and we ended up doing a
book with Syngress, just all
predicated upon getting a chance

82
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:49,000
to meet him by pool one. Just by
getting out and walking and
seeing people and people--once

83
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,625
you meet that one person, you're
going to end up meeting that
person's friends throughout the

84
00:08:53,625 --> 00:09:00,333
CON, too, so it's not just about
finding like a buddy to go --
well, I mean it's fun, too, but

85
00:09:00,333 --> 00:09:05,000
get to know as many other people
because you're never going to
know who that person is over

86
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,917
here could give you a book deal.
A lot of my friends have gotten
jobs through DEF CON. I know I

87
00:09:10,917 --> 00:09:16,417
wouldn't be where I am in my
career without the friends I've
made at DEF CON. And it all

88
00:09:16,417 --> 00:09:23,333
started with DEF CON 10, three
or four of us from a small
university in Texas saying, I

89
00:09:23,333 --> 00:09:29,458
think we can actually compete
and actually hang with these
people from California, and from

90
00:09:29,458 --> 00:09:35,625
New York, and from D.C. You
know, we're not in the middle of
the hacker scene, so to speak,

91
00:09:35,625 --> 00:09:41,042
but actually, I'm going to
invite another medic, Tim
McGuffon, up here to talk about

92
00:09:41,042 --> 00:09:47,042
our experiences at DEF CON 10.
[Applause] >> So at DEF CON 10,
we decided that we could compete

93
00:10:02,458 --> 00:10:06,583
in the Hacker Jeopardy, having
never seen it before. There were
no videos or anything back then,

94
00:10:06,583 --> 00:10:12,958
and we did. Myself, Aaron, and
his loving wife, Jen, the night
before she got lost with Bob and

95
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:18,958
Arkasha, [indiscernible]. So we
signed up as a team for Hacker
Jeopardy. We got chosen, and we

96
00:10:21,625 --> 00:10:26,375
walked up on stage, and we had
no idea what to expect. We're in
this sea in a parking lot in the

97
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:31,208
Alexis Park of about a thousand
people. It was hot. It was
sweaty, and there were random

98
00:10:31,208 --> 00:10:35,750
things happening behind us.
There was a scantily clad lady
there. We didn't know what to

99
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:41,417
expect. It was very out of my
element coming from conservative
Texas. So we get up on stage,

100
00:10:41,417 --> 00:10:45,708
and we're doing quite well at
Hacker Jeopardy, because the
questions that they're asking

101
00:10:45,708 --> 00:10:50,250
are low-level tech questions
that that's what we do. I mean,
my background is in electronics

102
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:56,250
and chemistry. Aaron's is in
computer science SCATA systems,
and Jen is a pop culture junkie.

103
00:10:58,417 --> 00:11:02,875
So it fit really well with the
questions that were being asked.
About halfway through the first

104
00:11:02,875 --> 00:11:08,958
round, we have enough points to
just stop playing, and we could
walk away with the win. I didn't

105
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:12,375
know the rules of Hacker
Jeopardy in the crowd at the
time, so whenever a daily double

106
00:11:12,375 --> 00:11:17,250
came up -- are you all familiar
with the daily doubles from the
old Hacker Jeopardy? OK, cool.

107
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:22,125
So whenever the daily double
came up, I wanted to spend 500
and just make a few more points

108
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:28,250
to solidify our lead and call it
done. Aaron having been tipsy
and drinking more than he

109
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:34,250
probably should have night
overrode my $500 bet and bet it
all. Every dollar we had. So he

110
00:11:36,833 --> 00:11:43,750
bet it all, and then we decided,
the question came up, and the
question was, which virus was

111
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:49,750
distributed across the security
- focused neophytes mailing list
in March 2002 was the question.

112
00:11:53,958 --> 00:11:58,125
And it was just blank stares. I
had no idea. Nobody in the
audience had an idea. It turns

113
00:11:58,125 --> 00:12:02,542
out it was My Party, but that
lost us all of our points. So
from that point forward, we're

114
00:12:02,542 --> 00:12:09,417
now in last place. We're broke,
and we start drinking to try to
make up our points. So you see

115
00:12:09,417 --> 00:12:13,667
it just goes downhill from there
because I'm not a big drinker,
but I had Corona at the time,

116
00:12:13,667 --> 00:12:17,750
and I'm not a huge Corona fan
either, so I had somebody run to
the bar and pick me up a bunch

117
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:21,500
of limes so I could try to mask
the taste, and it was just
horrible, but never trust your

118
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:27,750
friends at DEF CON. [ Laughter ]
>> I was doing my part to really
catch the team up, so I was

119
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:34,875
actually two-fisting them. As
quickly as I could, I had a real
nice screen of brown glass in

120
00:12:34,875 --> 00:12:39,250
front of me or white. I forget.
We were probably going to Bud
light at that point. >> Probably

121
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:43,958
so. No, it was Corona because we
were naked at the time. >> Yeah,
so that's fine. And so with that

122
00:12:43,958 --> 00:12:49,167
and just too kind of bring the
story full circle, one of the
other guys that we were

123
00:12:49,167 --> 00:12:54,208
competing with at DEF CON 10 I
just ran into actually onstage
at the Hacker Jeopardy trials

124
00:12:54,208 --> 00:12:59,458
tonight. Hacker Jeopardy was
having the trials from 1:00 to
3:00. They were looking for

125
00:12:59,458 --> 00:13:02,750
people to get up onstage. The
two guys standing beside me,
GMark pointed out and says, hey,

126
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:06,375
y'all come on up here. It turns
out we competed against Hacker
Jeopardy and had the same

127
00:13:06,375 --> 00:13:09,875
questions still in our head
where they had got it wrong and
we had got it right. It still

128
00:13:09,875 --> 00:13:15,625
wasn't enough points, but it was
a TCP Port maps, so HTTP plus
FTP divided by, and the answer

129
00:13:15,625 --> 00:13:20,333
was 31337. They got 31336
because they were off by a port
but come full circle. Here we

130
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:26,000
are 12 years -- 13 years later,
and still meet the same guys,
still reminisce about the same

131
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,417
things. It was a much smaller
community back then, much closer
knit. >> I thought you were

132
00:13:30,417 --> 00:13:35,458
going to tell the story about
pissing off everybody in DC
Forums. One of the admins and

133
00:13:38,542 --> 00:13:43,167
two or three of the moderators
at DC Forums pretty much hated
your guts. >> So the original

134
00:13:43,167 --> 00:13:50,208
board driving contest for DEF
CON 10 was the first one. >>
Just so you know, in case you

135
00:13:50,208 --> 00:13:54,875
were thinking about leaving,
this is about how to get the
most out of DEF CON. Granted

136
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:59,833
we're going to tell you war
stories. We're going to tell you
about the fun that we've had.

137
00:13:59,833 --> 00:14:04,667
We're certainly going to tell
you about how much Medic hates
beer and still gets drunk, but

138
00:14:04,667 --> 00:14:10,167
this is also how to get the most
out of the it because the common
theme is if you don't allow

139
00:14:10,167 --> 00:14:15,917
yourself to open up, if you do
not engage, you are not getting
the most out of your $220. >>

140
00:14:15,917 --> 00:14:20,875
We're just people. I'm nobody
special. I'm just a guy. >>
What? I thought it was $220. >>

141
00:14:20,875 --> 00:14:27,875
That's what I charged you in the
back of the line for the badge.
>> I was going to say $420, and

142
00:14:27,875 --> 00:14:34,583
if you meet me, I'll give you a
real badge. >> Did you say $420?
All right, go ahead. I heard

143
00:14:34,583 --> 00:14:41,292
$420. >> So back to the story
that he was alluding to for DEF
CON 10 is the rules for war

144
00:14:41,292 --> 00:14:47,083
driving contest where you had to
turn in your logs in Y scan
format. And there were two tools

145
00:14:47,083 --> 00:14:51,500
that put out Y scan format at
the time. Y scan, which was
written for BSD, and Netstumbler

146
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:56,000
written for Windows. I wanted to
use Kismet. So I started asking
the questions on the forums,

147
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,625
hey, what about other
alternative formats? And they
posted the rules, you must use Y

148
00:15:00,625 --> 00:15:05,583
scan format. OK, thanks. That's
not very helpful, guy. Come on.
I mean what other formats can we

149
00:15:05,583 --> 00:15:10,083
turn this in? How is your
scoring going to work? And it
was a-here are the rules. That

150
00:15:10,083 --> 00:15:14,917
was a subtle hint to me at the
time that if it's not written
down in the rules, it's legit.

151
00:15:14,917 --> 00:15:19,500
So if you can find a way to
still follow those rules and
bypass them, you can win.

152
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:25,208
RenderMan found that out a
couple years later whenever he
was disqualified from the

153
00:15:25,208 --> 00:15:30,083
wireless contest for running
fake AP. It was five 500 unique
access points, but they didn't

154
00:15:30,083 --> 00:15:33,833
say they had to be real, so he
launched fake AP on one
interface, launched Kismet on

155
00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:39,875
the other interface and logged
his 500, handed his laptop over
and was disqualified. But

156
00:15:39,875 --> 00:15:47,292
getting around those rules,
so... I ended up -- so I took
the argument from that to --

157
00:15:47,292 --> 00:15:53,750
from the forums to IRC with
Romer and he basically said,
look. >> And Russ. >> And Russ,

158
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:56,875
these are the rules, this the
way it's supposed to look.
Chris' avatar on the forums is a

159
00:15:56,875 --> 00:16:00,750
big middle finger, and it has
been since DEF CON 10 whenever I
started the argument with him

160
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:08,625
and he told me to fuck off. So I
wrote a script to do Kismet to Y
scan format. I went ahead, I

161
00:16:08,625 --> 00:16:13,250
wrote it one in VBScript to run
in a PERL and just made it
available, put it out there, and

162
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:18,458
then we showed up the day of the
war driving contest, and almost
all of the teams were using

163
00:16:18,458 --> 00:16:23,792
Kismet and my scripts to beat me
at my own game. If I would have
kept my mouth shut, used my own

164
00:16:23,792 --> 00:16:27,833
scripts for myself, used Kismet,
picked up all the hidden SSIDs,
we would have owned it, but the

165
00:16:27,833 --> 00:16:32,750
top three teams used my scripts
to score it and to compete
against me using the tool set

166
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:35,708
that I had put out there to make
public. So if you've got
something secret for winning

167
00:16:35,708 --> 00:16:41,458
contests, keep it secret until
after the contest is over. >> Or
if you're really big into the

168
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:45,458
sharing economy, you can
definitely do what Tim did. It
was one of those things, I don't

169
00:16:45,458 --> 00:16:49,292
think the war driving
competition would have been
successful if people would have

170
00:16:49,292 --> 00:16:56,667
been limited to only those that
were BSD enough to run the Y
scan app or anybody that's run

171
00:16:56,667 --> 00:17:01,542
[indiscernible] before. It's a
great program, but you're not
going to find anybody trying to

172
00:17:01,542 --> 00:17:08,917
hide their stuff. So if there
hadn't have been 15 teams there
competing in Kismet and there

173
00:17:08,917 --> 00:17:13,750
was a lot of media -- that was
the first year of the wireless
competition -- I think there

174
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:19,667
were three -- two or three media
outlets there at DC 10. There
were probably at ten there at DC

175
00:17:19,667 --> 00:17:26,667
11 because of the popularity of
the contest and I think because
people were able to find more. I

176
00:17:26,667 --> 00:17:32,875
mean it's way more fun winning
with, at the time, 1600 access
points than winning with 70

177
00:17:32,875 --> 00:17:37,583
access points. >> That magazine
did a write-up on Aaron and I
after that contest just because

178
00:17:37,583 --> 00:17:41,833
of the history and what we had
done and we weren't anybody. We
were just Podunk rednecks from

179
00:17:41,833 --> 00:17:47,000
Texas. So find whatever is new
and upcoming. So right now, the
STATA village is new this year.

180
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,958
You can bet next year there's
probably going to be contests
focused around the SCATA

181
00:17:49,958 --> 00:17:54,042
village. If you're into SCATA or
you have anything associated
with it, get in there and get

182
00:17:54,042 --> 00:17:58,250
involved with them, get involved
at the ground floor because
whenever it blows up to be a big

183
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:04,250
thing, you can be part of that
big thing. [Applause] >> That's
actually a big deal. These guys

184
00:18:12,708 --> 00:18:18,333
are not sit up in front of
people and chat, so this is a
big deal that they wanted to

185
00:18:18,333 --> 00:18:24,333
share that information with you.
You know, one of the things that
they talked about was contests,

186
00:18:27,625 --> 00:18:33,792
and Roots is up the hall, right,
way up there, and yet they're
doing a social engineering

187
00:18:33,792 --> 00:18:39,542
contest here in the hallways
trying to do their own contest,
learning how to pick locks,

188
00:18:39,542 --> 00:18:43,708
learning about cryptography, a
whole bunch of other stuff. And
it seems kind of silly, but the

189
00:18:43,708 --> 00:18:51,250
one thing that they do that most
of you in this room probably
don't do is involve a stranger

190
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:55,333
that can help you out. It's
actually kind of interesting.
It's kind of fun watching the

191
00:18:55,333 --> 00:18:59,667
kids because they just don't
know each other, and then all of
a sudden, I watched one little

192
00:18:59,667 --> 00:19:06,000
girl sit down with a lock pick
set and another little girl show
her how to use the rake. I mean,

193
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:11,292
fascinating, right? For those of
you that already know how to use
a rake, it's not really that

194
00:19:11,292 --> 00:19:14,833
fascinating, but it's
fascinating that just a complete
stranger came over and said,

195
00:19:14,833 --> 00:19:20,458
hey, do this. So think about
that. You know, you want to be
able to get involved. You want

196
00:19:20,458 --> 00:19:24,500
to be able to participate. You
want to be able to do these
things, and the more people that

197
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:27,875
you talk to, the more that
you're going to get to know
people, the more you are going

198
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:33,000
to meet, you know, interesting
people. Viking is a friend of
mine, and he's a friend of mine

199
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:39,000
because of DEF CON, because I
never would have met Viking
otherwise, but he's here. And

200
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:47,333
the amazing thing about Viking
is that he can eat any amount
pepper and it doesn't bother

201
00:19:47,333 --> 00:19:53,333
him. Anyway, I'm going to let
him come up here and tell you
some stories about being here at

202
00:19:56,708 --> 00:20:02,708
DEF CON. [Applause] >> I didn't
know I was talking >> No,
neither did I. >> Let me just

203
00:20:07,208 --> 00:20:12,625
say to my employer, please don't
fire me. I didn't know that this
was happening. None of this is

204
00:20:12,625 --> 00:20:18,042
endorsed by my employer, and I'm
not going to talk about anything
I do at work. That being said, I

205
00:20:18,042 --> 00:20:24,042
came here for DEF CON 16 was my
first CON. I didn't know
anybody, and kind of walked in

206
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:33,250
and had a terrible time. Didn't
really go out, didn't really get
involved, and then Romer and I

207
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:38,583
happened to meet after work,
came back the next year, and
he's like, hey, why don't you

208
00:20:38,583 --> 00:20:44,500
come hang out? Let's go and do
some stuff. And you know, I'll
get you into the cool parties

209
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:49,333
and introduce you to some
people, and that's how I kind of
ended up knowing Wiseacre and

210
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:56,125
all these guys that are up here
talking. But the really cool
thing for me was I went from

211
00:20:56,125 --> 00:21:02,125
being a nobody to having a group
of friends. Right? And what
Chris did for me, what Romer did

212
00:21:04,708 --> 00:21:08,042
for me was he showed me around.
He got me introduced to some
people and kind of got me to a

213
00:21:08,042 --> 00:21:14,042
point where I could get things
done a little easier at DEF CON,
and you know, I could get into

214
00:21:22,292 --> 00:21:28,417
some of the parties and I could
know some of the people, and I
could hang out. But you know,

215
00:21:28,417 --> 00:21:34,500
what I've tried to do in the
last couple of years is kind of
pay that back, right? So you

216
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:39,250
come to DEF CON, you learn
something. I guess my point
would be, you need to kind of

217
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:43,667
pay it back to the other people.
So now I've got some friends
that I drive around. I'm like,

218
00:21:43,667 --> 00:21:46,333
hey, I know these guys. Let me
come introduce you, right? My
advice to you is try and expand

219
00:21:46,333 --> 00:21:52,333
that circle. If you've got some
friends, introduce them to other
people. Get them talking to

220
00:21:55,417 --> 00:22:02,750
other people, right? Because
now, your circle gets bigger,
and I'll tell you that in what I

221
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:09,292
do for work, occasionally, I'm
not the smartest guy in the room
or on IRC, and I'll have

222
00:22:09,292 --> 00:22:15,208
questions, and I was in the
middle of the pen test a couple
of months ago and I -- well,

223
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:22,458
about a year ago-and I popped a
box and I knew that I could get,
you know -- I could be inside

224
00:22:22,458 --> 00:22:29,250
the domain if only I could
figure this one box out. And I
spent weeks. I owned the box,

225
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:34,958
but I couldn't -- I basically
needed to turn an outside
interface into an inside

226
00:22:34,958 --> 00:22:41,750
interface so I could continue my
exploitation. And I was just
stuck. And I got on IRC, and I

227
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:46,208
said, hey, does anybody know how
to do this? And one of my
friends came, and they said,

228
00:22:46,208 --> 00:22:50,583
well, I think you need to do
this. And I went and looked at
it. It wasn't right. Ended up

229
00:22:50,583 --> 00:22:55,833
stuck with some IP tables. I
said, hey, anybody really good
with IP chains? And one of the

230
00:22:55,833 --> 00:23:01,833
guys, Mike, who is somewhere
around here, said, yeah,
absolutely. I sent him one. I

231
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:10,750
told him what I wanted to do. He
sent me back the rules, and I
was in, the main admin. What I'm

232
00:23:13,542 --> 00:23:19,667
saying is make some friends, but
then introduce them to other
people. If you meet somebody

233
00:23:19,667 --> 00:23:25,500
cool or you meet somebody smart,
introduce them to somebody else.
Right? Introduce the guy who

234
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:29,708
doesn't know anybody to
somebody, because you just
expanded that guy's circle,

235
00:23:29,708 --> 00:23:37,208
right? And, you know, make those
circles bigger for your friends
and make them bigger for people

236
00:23:37,208 --> 00:23:41,542
who aren't there. The other
night we had some kid sit down.
A bunch of us were sitting

237
00:23:41,542 --> 00:23:46,167
around drinking, and he said,
hey, I want to get into the
security business. So we sat him

238
00:23:46,167 --> 00:23:50,708
down and we said, well, tell us
a little bit about yourself. And
we spent 10 or 15 minutes trying

239
00:23:50,708 --> 00:23:57,500
to get this kid who'd just
gotten out of university and
flown here from the UK, but, you

240
00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:02,042
know, trying to get this kid to
understand what he wanted to do
because he really didn't know.

241
00:24:02,042 --> 00:24:07,042
He was just like, I just got out
of college, and I want to do
this stuff. And you know, but

242
00:24:07,042 --> 00:24:14,708
taking that time, and maybe he
will, maybe he won't. But pay it
back. I guess that's my primary

243
00:24:14,708 --> 00:24:21,708
point. I don't have any great
stories about DEF CON. But. >>
[Off mic]. >> Honestly, I've

244
00:24:21,708 --> 00:24:26,292
usually had a little bit to
drink when I'm here, and
sometimes I don't remember

245
00:24:26,292 --> 00:24:32,292
everything that happens, so
there is some video. [ Laughter
] >> There is some video. But

246
00:24:38,083 --> 00:24:44,083
that's basically all I've got.
But I'm going to put the onus on
AJ. Oh, yes, I am. >> I'm a

247
00:24:48,667 --> 00:24:54,667
fairly good [Off mic]. >> So how
many of you guys went to the DC
101 talk on Thursday at 10:00? A

248
00:24:57,583 --> 00:25:03,958
few guys, okay, cool. DC 101
started out basically just as a
panel to let people know, you

249
00:25:03,958 --> 00:25:10,125
know, this is what you should
expect from DEF CON. All you
noobs, you should know to come

250
00:25:10,125 --> 00:25:17,417
in here and make friends and do
this and do that and don't do
this other thing, and usually,

251
00:25:17,417 --> 00:25:23,417
it's a little bit more peppered
with flavorful language. And
part of it also is about having

252
00:25:26,333 --> 00:25:31,458
people come up on stage and
learning about getting a handle,
because you're going to find

253
00:25:31,458 --> 00:25:36,667
that a lot of people want to
remain anonymous when they're
here at DEF CON, and if you

254
00:25:36,667 --> 00:25:43,333
truly want to remain anonymous,
then why would you have a big
orange Mohawk. But nevertheless,

255
00:25:43,333 --> 00:25:51,333
that's part of it. And AliJohn
actually did not get his handle
here. He got it through

256
00:25:51,333 --> 00:25:58,417
Blackhat. And it was actually
kind of fun. AliJohn's handle is
Pushpin. And even though I've

257
00:25:58,417 --> 00:26:05,250
bailed him for a little bit, he
is going to get up here and
talk. And he's Pushpin because

258
00:26:05,250 --> 00:26:12,750
the first time we saw him, he
was following around Joe Grand,
AKA Kingpin, as seen on TV Joe

259
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:18,750
Grand, and he just looked like a
little mini-me of Joe Grand, and
from Kingpin went Pushpin. So

260
00:26:24,083 --> 00:26:30,083
one of the things I'd like
AliJohn to talk about is, I mean
AliJohn gave his first talk this

261
00:26:30,083 --> 00:26:37,875
year, and that's a big deal,
because Viking said, pay it
forward. And it is kind of

262
00:26:37,875 --> 00:26:41,958
something that you want to be
able to do, because there's a
lot of people that come to this

263
00:26:41,958 --> 00:26:47,875
conference that really don't
know what's going on. Highway
said it. They're sock jockey.

264
00:26:47,875 --> 00:26:54,708
They're knock jockeys. They're
code monkeys. They're whatever,
but they're not hackers, at

265
00:26:54,708 --> 00:26:58,750
least not in their heads, and
they just don't know, how do I
make that change? How do I make

266
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:04,750
that distinction? And AliJohn's
talk was about becoming a pen
tester, how to do a pen test.

267
00:27:07,042 --> 00:27:13,042
Actually, aptly titled "Poppin'
boxes like a pro." So here's
Pushpin. [Applause] >> Thank

268
00:27:18,625 --> 00:27:26,500
you. All right. I took notes
while we were -- while they were
talking. And I'll just start

269
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:32,500
with DEF CON 16. I came out here
with the UAT, who is obviously a
vendor, and we competed and lost

270
00:27:37,125 --> 00:27:43,917
Mystery Challenge. Wee -- it
took up the entire conference.
And it is so complex and

271
00:27:43,917 --> 00:27:50,625
complicated that it involved
crypto, it involved differently
languages. It involved working

272
00:27:50,625 --> 00:27:56,208
with paper and just the most
complicated thing you could
imagine. And our team of maybe

273
00:27:56,208 --> 00:28:00,417
six or seven people, we didn't
have that knowledge. Yeah, sure,
we knew a little bit of crypto

274
00:28:00,417 --> 00:28:05,958
or we knew how to pop a box, but
we didn't know Korean or we
didn't know how to do this one

275
00:28:05,958 --> 00:28:12,792
thing. So that competition
forced all of us to go to almost
every part of this conference

276
00:28:12,792 --> 00:28:18,792
and gain knowledge to finish
this competition. And for two
years, I think we won every now

277
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:28,000
and again, but it was fun. After
that, I graduated. Russ, who is
obviously very involved here,

278
00:28:31,333 --> 00:28:38,208
was one of our professors, I was
sitting in the lab, and I'm
like, I can't find a job

279
00:28:38,208 --> 00:28:44,208
anywhere. He was like, oh hey,
toss me your resume. A month
later, I am now, I skipped all

280
00:28:48,625 --> 00:28:55,542
of the painful, horrible work
that we all have to do -- the IT
support help desk, the sys

281
00:28:55,542 --> 00:29:03,083
admin, the network admin. I just
jumped all of it, and I am now
part of this insanely skilled

282
00:29:03,083 --> 00:29:09,083
team of people that I am nowhere
near in skill set. >> He's
selling himself short. >> Sure.

283
00:29:12,583 --> 00:29:18,583
But for the past -- from then to
today, I cannot believe where I
am. I've worked for two

284
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:30,875
government agencies. I have been
co-authored a book, again,
thanks to Russ and Evil Rob. I

285
00:29:30,875 --> 00:29:38,583
now work at PlayStation. It's
astonishing. Some days I walk
into work, and I just stop and

286
00:29:38,583 --> 00:29:46,500
I'm like, whoa. I would not be
here today if it wasn't for
Russ, it wasn't for Highway, if

287
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:53,708
it wasn't for Chris, who is now
my boss who, I mean, I worked
with Mike. I worked with a lot

288
00:29:53,708 --> 00:29:59,708
of people here, and I don't know
what my life would be like if I
didn't come to DEF CON. So does

289
00:30:03,167 --> 00:30:09,167
that work? >> Yeah, thanks.
[Applause] >> We wanted
shenanigans. Talk about what? >>

290
00:30:23,208 --> 00:30:29,708
Fun story. Before I forget,
you're going to see up here on
either side of the podium all of

291
00:30:29,708 --> 00:30:34,833
these faces. This is part of the
faces of DEF CON. The faces of
DEF CON kind of started by

292
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:40,833
ArtYeti, and if you have not
been in the contest to see his
art, you have to go. At the very

293
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:50,375
least, you have to see what he
puts into this work. Eddy is a
pen tester, and he's a brilliant

294
00:30:50,375 --> 00:30:58,292
artist as well, but the faces of
DEF CON are kind of the history
of DEF CON as well. It starts

295
00:30:58,292 --> 00:31:05,333
with Dark Changing and Jeff Moss
and it just grew. So you're
going to see faces in the crowd

296
00:31:05,333 --> 00:31:08,917
that you recognize, or you may
not recognize them because we
don't have brown on our face or

297
00:31:08,917 --> 00:31:13,708
whatever, but you're still going
to recognize them because these
guys that kind of made this

298
00:31:13,708 --> 00:31:18,792
whole thing grow. They are the
guys that kind of made
everything. So, you know, this

299
00:31:18,792 --> 00:31:25,958
whole, long theme is going to
be-you've got involved. And
actually, part of what AliJohn

300
00:31:25,958 --> 00:31:32,000
just said about telling about
the shirt, when AliJohn first
started coming, we used to have

301
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:37,958
a little tradition on Tuesday
before DEF CON going to Gonzalez
y Gonzalez over in New York, New

302
00:31:37,958 --> 00:31:43,958
York and having dinner. And as
we were going down, the year
previous, the guys traded a

303
00:31:46,833 --> 00:31:54,667
shirt with Joe Grand with one of
the guys that flips the little
escorts girls direct to you

304
00:31:54,667 --> 00:32:00,292
cards, and his shirt was
disgusting. But Joe thought it
was so funny he actually wore it

305
00:32:00,292 --> 00:32:07,792
for his talk the next day. So
the next year we decided we're
going to do it again. Of course,

306
00:32:07,792 --> 00:32:12,833
AliJohn being there the year
that he had earned the Pushpin
nickname, we were going to get

307
00:32:12,833 --> 00:32:17,375
one for him, too. And it was a
little bit tougher that year
because these guys only get one

308
00:32:17,375 --> 00:32:22,625
shirt. And well now they get
multiple shirts, and some of
them even get these flashing

309
00:32:22,625 --> 00:32:27,208
signs, and sometimes they don't
even have to have the shirts.
They just sit there flipping the

310
00:32:27,208 --> 00:32:35,042
cards at you. And so we had to
pay. And we put it on AliJohn,
and oh, my God, you would have

311
00:32:35,042 --> 00:32:42,042
thought we were pouring acid on
him because it was yucky. It was
sweaty and dirty. I mean it was

312
00:32:42,042 --> 00:32:48,042
almost like this guy was
sleeping in it. But he may have
been sleeping in it. But AliJohn

313
00:32:50,375 --> 00:32:56,542
was a good sport and he actually
wore the shirt and wore it to
dinner and wore it back to his

314
00:32:56,542 --> 00:33:03,208
hotel room and then promptly
showered for an hour half in
scalding water. It's part of the

315
00:33:03,208 --> 00:33:09,208
fun that we have. The cool thing
about this conference is, first
of all, it's over a weekend, so

316
00:33:11,208 --> 00:33:15,250
you don't have to worry about,
you know, am I going to be
having to get up? Am I going to

317
00:33:15,250 --> 00:33:19,292
have to have work giving me a
call? Most people don't have to
worry about that. It's over a

318
00:33:19,292 --> 00:33:23,042
weekend, so it gives you an
opportunity to actually do a
little bit more. It gives you an

319
00:33:23,042 --> 00:33:27,417
opportunity to hang loose
because there's all the events
during the day, and then there's

320
00:33:27,417 --> 00:33:34,000
all the events at night. And one
of the things that Viking
brought up is parties. DEF CON

321
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:41,125
used to be basically eight hours
of conference and 16 hours of
parties. It's kind of morphed a

322
00:33:41,125 --> 00:33:47,708
little bit. It's not quite 16
hours. We've extended the talks
a little bit longer so there's a

323
00:33:47,708 --> 00:33:53,000
little party in there that
overlaps, and you'll see even
when the new speakers are giving

324
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:59,625
a talk, the speaker goons will
run up, give him a shot help to
help them calm down and help

325
00:33:59,625 --> 00:34:05,583
them relax. And it is kind of
fun. So it's a fun environment,
an opportunity for you to come

326
00:34:05,583 --> 00:34:09,042
in and relax, and the parties
are cool, but you don't always
get invited to the parties,

327
00:34:09,042 --> 00:34:15,042
especially if you don't know the
303 Mafia. Then you're not going
to their cool party, which is

328
00:34:17,292 --> 00:34:23,292
happening tonight. Suck it, I'm
going! [ Laughter ] >> And I'm,
you know, 303 by proxy because

329
00:34:25,375 --> 00:34:30,042
of the people that I know, and
it's actually kind of cool, and
I've talked about the 303 Mafia,

330
00:34:30,042 --> 00:34:35,333
but they are a tightknit group
of friends who are very proud of
their area code, and they're

331
00:34:35,333 --> 00:34:41,125
also very proud of the stuff
that they do. And they come in
and they actually make a

332
00:34:41,125 --> 00:34:47,500
significant portion of this DEF
CON happen. So, you know,
getting to know people, do not

333
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:54,625
try to get in the party by
saying you know Pyro because
everybody says they know Pyro.

334
00:34:54,625 --> 00:34:59,292
And Pyro's favorite story, he
told it on Thursday, is about
the guy who came up in line and

335
00:34:59,292 --> 00:35:03,583
said, hey, I want to go in the
party. And they said, well, who
invited you? And the guy said

336
00:35:03,583 --> 00:35:09,583
Pyro and then started defending
Pyro to Pyro. It doesn't really
work that way. So again, this is

337
00:35:14,917 --> 00:35:20,917
what brings you along because if
you ever met Pyro, you would go,
huh, he's a cool guy. He's fun

338
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:30,042
to hang out with. You would not
know the stuff that he knows,
the math that he does in his

339
00:35:30,042 --> 00:35:34,458
head. He is a brilliant guy, and
you certainly wouldn't know that
just by watching him walking

340
00:35:34,458 --> 00:35:40,917
down the hall. But because I've
gotten to know him, I now know
some of the cool stuff that he

341
00:35:40,917 --> 00:35:47,083
does, and he actually is a
really smart guy. Now, I'd like
to open it up to any of you guys

342
00:35:47,083 --> 00:35:50,667
because I know a bunch of you
are getting a little bit bored,
and you might have some

343
00:35:50,667 --> 00:35:55,542
questions, especially since
apparently we've got an hour and
a half more to go. You might

344
00:35:55,542 --> 00:36:02,375
have some questions. You might
want to know, what's going on?
How do I get a handle? You know,

345
00:36:02,375 --> 00:36:08,125
or anything. Is there anybody?
Come on. We've got microphones.
You over there, sir, not even

346
00:36:08,125 --> 00:36:14,125
close to a microphone. >> What's
going on and how to I get a
handle? [Applause] [ Laughter ]

347
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:31,000
>> So there are lots of things
that are going on. A lot of them
are printed in the schedule. A

348
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:35,333
lot of that stuff -- what's
that? >> [Off mic]. >> Oh, yeah,
come on up here. We'll actually

349
00:36:35,333 --> 00:36:41,333
give you a handle, Mr. Helper.
Yeah. >> Oh, nice, hey, I've
also got good news. Apparently,

350
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:53,625
there's nothing scheduled after
this, so if you guys run out of
questions, and I start to lose

351
00:36:53,625 --> 00:36:58,875
my voice, it will be okay. So
again, a lot of this stuff is
printed and then a lot of this

352
00:36:58,875 --> 00:37:03,833
stuff you're going to find out
just by word of mouth. So here's
what we're going to do. I'm

353
00:37:03,833 --> 00:37:08,875
going to have you stand over
here, and you're going to tell
me five things about yourself --

354
00:37:08,875 --> 00:37:14,042
five things that you think are
important to yourself. It could
be five things that people don't

355
00:37:14,042 --> 00:37:21,000
know about you. Does anybody in
here know him? >> No. >> Oh,
this is even better. This proves

356
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:27,000
my point. Yeah? [ Laughter ] >>
All right. I'm from Portland,
Portland, Oregon. I'm a software

357
00:37:33,708 --> 00:37:39,750
engineer for an open source
program. I'm a community
manager. I wear this GitHub

358
00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:45,250
sweatshirt because I got it at
OSCON two weeks ago. It's
similar. That one's at home.

359
00:37:45,250 --> 00:37:51,250
It's a nighttime sweatshirt. I
don't know. That's pretty much
it, yeah. I'm a smart ass. I'm a

360
00:37:58,625 --> 00:38:04,667
smart ass when I -- when I hear
somebody throw something up as
open as what he did. I'm going

361
00:38:04,667 --> 00:38:10,667
to go ahead and call it out.
This is my first DEF CON. I came
here with my friend, and I don't

362
00:38:13,917 --> 00:38:19,042
know what's going on, because
there's like several resources
to find out what's going on and

363
00:38:19,042 --> 00:38:25,042
none of them agree. So that's a
little bit about me. >> All
right. Awesome. You stand over

364
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:38,708
here. [Applause] >> All right.
Cheshire cat is close. Hello
Kitty is too many syllables.

365
00:38:38,708 --> 00:38:46,708
Curious Kitty, too many
syllables, but I'm liking where
this is heading, you know. >>

366
00:38:46,708 --> 00:38:52,708
Wait I second, what. >> TMI. >>
All righty. You are TMI Kitty!
[Applause] >> What that means

367
00:39:11,542 --> 00:39:17,542
/NickTMIKitty. >> Yes.
#DC-Forums on F net. They're the
DEF CON forums, and pretty much

368
00:39:25,792 --> 00:39:31,208
anybody can join. You have to
participate. On occasion, they
will go through the logs to see

369
00:39:31,208 --> 00:39:36,167
how much you participate, and if
you don't participate, they will
kick you. And then you join

370
00:39:36,167 --> 00:39:39,083
again and you say, hey, it's TMI
Kitty, and I have a question
about next year's party

371
00:39:39,083 --> 00:39:45,083
schedule. And then you'll get
just as much crap in the
channel, but you'll have a good

372
00:39:50,750 --> 00:39:57,042
time. And it actually is pretty
cool because the people that are
in the DEF CON forums channel do

373
00:39:57,042 --> 00:40:03,208
a lot participation. Be prepared
for a lot of drama. But be
prepared also for understanding

374
00:40:03,208 --> 00:40:06,875
exactly what's going to be going
on, and they can point you to
things and introduce you to

375
00:40:06,875 --> 00:40:12,417
things. There was a DEF CON
forums party last night. I did
not go. I was at a different

376
00:40:12,417 --> 00:40:18,417
party. So... who's next? You,
sir! >> I want to give a shout
out to a goon from over a decade

377
00:40:23,250 --> 00:40:30,125
ago. Priest grabbed my daughter
out of the audience at age
roughly 15. I don't know if she

378
00:40:30,125 --> 00:40:37,750
was 15 or 16 yet and had her
place [indiscernible]. First
wall she got one, but it got her

379
00:40:37,750 --> 00:40:43,625
hooked on communicating, the
same thing you just heard. And
he asked her, what are you going

380
00:40:43,625 --> 00:40:49,625
to go do with your life? What do
you want to go do, things like
that. He's talked to her a half

381
00:40:54,167 --> 00:41:01,333
dozen times since here,
basically, and convinced her to
go to college. That's what it's

382
00:41:01,333 --> 00:41:07,667
about. [Applause] >> Didn't you
want to handle? >> I've got
student in the audience. I'm

383
00:41:07,667 --> 00:41:13,667
going to really pay for this.
I'm a college professor -- >>
Who doesn't need a microphone.

384
00:41:15,792 --> 00:41:21,792
>> Former military. Saw combat
in the Middle East. >> Thank
you. [Applause] >> Married, and

385
00:41:34,042 --> 00:41:40,042
I'm going to pay for this, I
like cats. >> Wow. You know
what? That one's going to stick.

386
00:41:49,125 --> 00:41:55,125
There's no debate--Dr. Kitty!
[Applause] >> Now part of this
is fun, right? We're talking

387
00:41:59,917 --> 00:42:07,083
about getting your handle. And
when you get your nickname,
everybody wants to start out

388
00:42:07,083 --> 00:42:13,083
with a bad ass nickname, right?
I want to be Siphon, or I want
to be Revolver, and it doesn't

389
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:21,500
work that way, because not
everybody can be bad ass. First
of all, IRC only takes 8

390
00:42:24,792 --> 00:42:30,250
characters, and second of all,
it's a lot more fun when you've
got something that you have now

391
00:42:30,250 --> 00:42:35,417
earned. Let me tell you about
the guy who's my second. By the
way, I am in charge of the

392
00:42:35,417 --> 00:42:40,167
vendor area. If you like it,
awesome, come up and tell me. If
you don't like it, awesome, come

393
00:42:40,167 --> 00:42:44,958
up and tell me, and I will
remind you that I make the
decisions. But I am interested

394
00:42:44,958 --> 00:42:49,667
in your opinions because the
vendor area-- I'm going to get
distracted, and then we're going

395
00:42:49,667 --> 00:42:56,958
to go back to picking on people.
The vendor area is designed to
give people something tangible,

396
00:42:56,958 --> 00:43:02,375
something that they can take
with them from here, whether
it's a T-shirt or whether it is

397
00:43:02,375 --> 00:43:08,833
an idea, you know, we try and
make sure that everybody that's
there is involved in the

398
00:43:08,833 --> 00:43:14,625
community. So you'll see a mix
of, you know, homegrown artists,
and you're going to see a mix

399
00:43:14,625 --> 00:43:20,417
also of corporate vendors, like
Pony Express and Rapid 7. You
know Pony Express started here

400
00:43:20,417 --> 00:43:26,000
before they were corporate. Kind
of cool, right? And they've been
a vendor ever since, and they

401
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:31,667
give back to the community. The
same thing with Rapid 7. Even
though they're a big corporate

402
00:43:31,667 --> 00:43:35,833
shell, they still have an
awesome tool. It's still
community supported, and it

403
00:43:35,833 --> 00:43:43,458
still works. So with that in
mind, I have a second who is
right now running the area, and

404
00:43:43,458 --> 00:43:50,167
his nickname is Wad. And he had
a couple of other nicknames that
he liked. I think one of them

405
00:43:50,167 --> 00:43:57,833
might have been Ace. But Danny
and I were working together, and
he'll kill me for telling this

406
00:43:57,833 --> 00:44:04,250
story, but Danny and I were
working together at -- we were
giving a demo. Chris was also

407
00:44:04,250 --> 00:44:11,667
working with us, and Danny's job
was to type a password in to a
demonstration workstation. It

408
00:44:11,667 --> 00:44:17,667
was Windows XP. And we just
said, type password. That's all
we want is password. It's not

409
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:23,792
connected to anything, and we're
going to hack it. Let's make it
easy on ourselves. That way the

410
00:44:23,792 --> 00:44:30,292
demo works. And so he typed it.
And we walked away, and we came
back a few minutes later, and

411
00:44:30,292 --> 00:44:35,042
we're like, OK, it's time to
test it. Go ahead and log into
that box. Types password.

412
00:44:35,042 --> 00:44:39,292
Doesn't work. Types password
again, doesn't work. We're like
crap. We're giving this demo in

413
00:44:39,292 --> 00:44:45,500
30 minutes, and we're going to
have to hack this box just so we
can give this demo. The guy that

414
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:51,500
was our team lead comes in from
across the hall, and he says,
what's the problem? Danny, you

415
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:56,583
know, something's wrong with the
password. The guy walks over,
the first try, he types

416
00:44:56,583 --> 00:45:02,583
P-A-S-S-W-O-D. It works! Danny
is now Passwod.
PASSWOD@gmail.com exists.

417
00:45:17,125 --> 00:45:24,542
Passwod@Yahoo.com exists. We
signed him up for everything
because it was so funny, but

418
00:45:24,542 --> 00:45:31,083
Passwod is too many syllables,
so he became WOD. We were
calling him WOD. Then he shows

419
00:45:31,083 --> 00:45:36,542
up one time, and Chris, Danny,
and I were all in an assessment,
and we'd went to a club. Well,

420
00:45:36,542 --> 00:45:43,917
it was a bar, and at that bar,
they had black lights. Danny
walks in with his T-shirt, and

421
00:45:43,917 --> 00:45:49,917
it looked like a crime scene. [
Laughter ] >> It was not
Luminol, and as it turns out,

422
00:46:00,250 --> 00:46:07,042
Tide, when it is not thoroughly
rinsed will glow under black
light. However, that was his WOD

423
00:46:07,042 --> 00:46:13,042
shirt, and now, he is WOD. All
right. Who wants to get another
handle? I know that I can drag

424
00:46:17,542 --> 00:46:23,542
this out for at least another 10
minutes. You, sir. Oh, you have
a question instead? >> Oh, okay.

425
00:46:32,583 --> 00:46:38,583
[ Laughter ] >> First question.
How do you change your handle if
you're not satisfied with it? >>

426
00:46:50,083 --> 00:46:56,167
Well, I will tell you that Danny
has tried to change his handle.
I've known Danny since, well,

427
00:46:56,167 --> 00:47:02,167
I've known Danny since 2001, and
Danny has tried to change his
handle for the last 11 years.

428
00:47:05,333 --> 00:47:12,625
And it just doesn't happen. So
you can end up, you can learn to
accept it. And it's kind of cool

429
00:47:12,625 --> 00:47:19,875
because if you have a handle
like that, it kind of gives you
a story. One of Pyro's seconds,

430
00:47:19,875 --> 00:47:25,833
a guy who now is running the
events is Coleslaw. I'm not
going to tell you why he's

431
00:47:25,833 --> 00:47:32,250
Coleslaw. It's an awesome story,
though. So you may not be
pleased with your handle at

432
00:47:32,250 --> 00:47:39,792
first. But you may grow to love
it. Now, Dr. Kitty, actually
might love that handle. It kind

433
00:47:39,792 --> 00:47:45,792
of sounds almost like from
Venture Bros. [ Laughter ] >>
For those of you who didn't hear

434
00:47:55,875 --> 00:48:01,875
Viking, the gynecologist, yes.
But, you know -- nice! Yeah, Dr.
Sandy Vagina. All right. So if

435
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:20,167
you don't like it, then try and
work into something else.
Pushpin has tried to change his

436
00:48:20,167 --> 00:48:24,750
handle, too, but Pushpin is a
cool handle. Sometimes you're
going to get one. There was a

437
00:48:24,750 --> 00:48:29,208
guy the other day that played
this game with us. He probably
isn't going to like his

438
00:48:29,208 --> 00:48:35,208
handle-MeowMix. But you might be
able to find a way to change
your handle. I can tell you

439
00:48:38,667 --> 00:48:44,667
right now if you don't tell us
silly things, we're not going to
give you a silly handle.

440
00:48:50,125 --> 00:48:56,125
[Laughter] >> Second question,
how do you get an Uber badge? >>
Ah Uber badge, so Uber badge

441
00:48:59,958 --> 00:49:04,667
actually this is kind of cool.
The other gentleman was talking
about contests. Now not every

442
00:49:04,667 --> 00:49:11,833
contest gets an Uber badge. A
lot of that decision making is
made later. Uber badge is a

443
00:49:11,833 --> 00:49:17,375
black badge. It is the badge
that you get, and if you get an
Uber badge you get free entrance

444
00:49:17,375 --> 00:49:23,292
into Def Con for life. And you
get to walk around with a cool
Uber -- Black badge -- This is

445
00:49:23,292 --> 00:49:28,875
green, imagine if it was black
and said Uber. And you get the
distinction of having won a

446
00:49:28,875 --> 00:49:34,167
contest and being pretty bad ass
at Def Con. Because it is pretty
hard. There was a point where

447
00:49:34,167 --> 00:49:38,875
you could get an Uber badge for
anything. I think that we even
had an Uber badge for Guitar

448
00:49:38,875 --> 00:49:44,292
Hero at one point. But now it's
a lot harder. You know, we've
had contests where people will

449
00:49:44,292 --> 00:49:50,292
actually drop out because nobody
can do it. Danny, Chris and I
did a Raiders of the Lost Ark

450
00:49:52,792 --> 00:49:58,500
style wireless hacking. Where
you had to hack something and it
led to hacking something else,

451
00:49:58,500 --> 00:50:02,875
and it led to hacking something
else -- it was 10 different
things. It wasn't that hard, but

452
00:50:02,875 --> 00:50:07,333
people dropped out. Anyway, so
the way you get it is by
participating in a contest and

453
00:50:07,333 --> 00:50:11,708
hoping that that's going to be
an Uber badge contest. I can
tell you there are certain ones

454
00:50:11,708 --> 00:50:16,375
that almost always are going to
be Uber badge contests and they
are going to be the ones that

455
00:50:16,375 --> 00:50:24,250
involve a lot of work. So Loss
Challenge is an Uber badge
contest. Alijohns group got an

456
00:50:24,250 --> 00:50:30,875
Uber badge but he's never gotten
to wear it. So. >> But basically
you have to be massively

457
00:50:30,875 --> 00:50:37,542
awesome. >> No not always,
clearly if you are good at
Guitar Hero you could of had one

458
00:50:37,542 --> 00:50:40,458
back in the day. [Laughter] >>
But yes, you do have to be
awesome and you do have -- and

459
00:50:40,458 --> 00:50:46,458
when it's a team, one badge is
handed out. But everybody gets
the recognition, only one person

460
00:50:46,458 --> 00:50:50,833
gets to use it so you know for
Alijohn if he can ever convince
and of the guys -- there's two

461
00:50:50,833 --> 00:50:56,000
badges cause his team won two
years -- if he can convince
anybody there to let him wear

462
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:00,042
that badge he can get in for
free. Of course he decided, I'm
not going to do that, I'll go

463
00:51:00,042 --> 00:51:06,042
ahead and be a speaker instead.
Now, tell us 5 things about
yourself. Goatee Kitty.

464
00:51:10,625 --> 00:51:16,625
[Laughter] >> Ok so, hi
everyone, I'm Frederick, I'm
from Germany, from Munich. This

465
00:51:20,750 --> 00:51:25,833
is my first Def Con also my
first Blackhat. I can tell you I
won't be going to Blackhat

466
00:51:25,833 --> 00:51:31,833
anymore. [Laughter] >> A few
things about me, so I'm in
Infosec for roughly two years

467
00:51:34,458 --> 00:51:40,833
now. I just finished my
apprenticeship in February, I'm
not actually working in Infosec

468
00:51:40,833 --> 00:51:47,375
for two years now, but I am kind
of interested in doing it. I
finished my apprenticeship as a

469
00:51:47,375 --> 00:51:54,833
Sys Admin in February 2013, so
not that long ago. And I was
working as a guitar and violin

470
00:51:54,833 --> 00:52:00,833
maker before that. So, yeah,
that was quite a change. What
else? >> Strings! [Laughter] >>

471
00:52:07,542 --> 00:52:15,083
Ok, I think that's it. >> Yeah
>> I hear Hackavarious, Strings
and what was the other one? >>

472
00:52:15,083 --> 00:52:21,083
Fiddler! >> Fiddler. >> Strings!
>> Strings. >> Strings. Strings
it is sir. Please enjoy.

473
00:52:26,042 --> 00:52:32,042
[Applause] >> You should
definitely not be ashamed of
Strings. Now you've got a fun

474
00:52:34,458 --> 00:52:39,417
story. A lot of people ask me,
how did you get into Infosec? I
used to sell beer wine and

475
00:52:39,417 --> 00:52:46,917
liquor. Not an easy transition,
I can tell you that my ex-wife
did not like that job. So I got

476
00:52:46,917 --> 00:52:52,292
into computers as a result of
that. Has nothing to do with my
handle Wise-Acre. It simply is

477
00:52:52,292 --> 00:52:56,292
-- I used to sell beer, wine and
liquor and that's what led to me
getting into computers so.

478
00:52:56,292 --> 00:53:04,000
Alright. I believe there was one
other audience, yes you sir.
Yeah. >> So I had a question and

479
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:11,083
if you guys want to give me a
handle you are certainly welcome
too. >> Ok, well you know the

480
00:53:11,083 --> 00:53:16,750
handle is optional. If you came
on Thursday the Handle is not
optional. However -- the

481
00:53:16,750 --> 00:53:23,833
question is? Oh, so you got to
see that. >> So, my question
would be -- I am currently a

482
00:53:23,833 --> 00:53:29,875
software developer, I squash
bugs for a living, however I am
more interested in going -- I

483
00:53:29,875 --> 00:53:36,958
have an interest in the internet
of things and how do you get
your -- how do you get started

484
00:53:36,958 --> 00:53:42,292
with hardware buzzing and that
sort of thing? Because that's
completely different in terms of

485
00:53:42,292 --> 00:53:48,667
the other things that I do. >>
Sure. Hardware Hacking Village.
You know, I would like to be

486
00:53:48,667 --> 00:53:55,042
able to say something funny
about that. >> Internet of
things in terms of -- ok so if

487
00:53:55,042 --> 00:54:01,417
we got a brand new -- entirely
to much lapse in security.
What's going on with fixed --

488
00:54:01,417 --> 00:54:08,167
and all that stuff. >> Very
valid, were you going to answer
his question? >> I was going to

489
00:54:08,167 --> 00:54:13,125
say if you're interested in
Internet of Things with the
respect to automation, power

490
00:54:13,125 --> 00:54:18,792
meters, load meters, things like
that -- so there is an ICS
village this year, Industrial

491
00:54:18,792 --> 00:54:23,750
Control Systems that is focused
more towards automation of
industry, however they have a

492
00:54:23,750 --> 00:54:28,375
lot of similar characteristics
where you have an underpowered
piece of hardware that's

493
00:54:28,375 --> 00:54:34,042
essential to operation that is
not -- that does not have enough
potential to actually run

494
00:54:34,042 --> 00:54:40,083
security and it was never
designed to be run secure. So
from accross the globe they gave

495
00:54:40,083 --> 00:54:47,167
it a public IP and they leave it
out there, so actually the --
has a lot of different areas

496
00:54:47,167 --> 00:54:52,833
where you can test specific
hardware and learn how some of
the secure coding practices work

497
00:54:52,833 --> 00:54:59,917
with those as well. It may not
be exactly what you are looking
for but I guarantee there is a

498
00:54:59,917 --> 00:55:07,792
lot of liked minded folks in
there. >> Chances are if you
were to do Google search on How

499
00:55:07,792 --> 00:55:15,167
do I do this, One of the people
that has written about it is
here this weekend. So, don't be

500
00:55:15,167 --> 00:55:22,000
afraid -- if it's published, ask
the author. Send an email.
There's a reason that those

501
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:28,000
people publish. It's not just
because they want to share with
the world how smart they are,

502
00:55:31,333 --> 00:55:37,167
they also want to be able to
distribute that knowledge. There
are still some people that want

503
00:55:37,167 --> 00:55:43,708
to help. You know, they want to
pay it forward. You might think
-- you're at Def Con and people

504
00:55:43,708 --> 00:55:48,750
are going to prank you. You know
I took a guy to lunch the other
day and I got a Diamond card and

505
00:55:48,750 --> 00:55:53,417
I say, hey let's go skip the
line. I had to leave so he got
to eat by himself, actually he

506
00:55:53,417 --> 00:55:57,417
was with his friends, but never
the less, he was the third
person in line that I had to

507
00:55:57,417 --> 00:56:01,500
talk to to convince them, why
don't you walk to the front of
the line with me. Don't be

508
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:05,042
afraid to do that because
chances are you are going to
find somebody that really does

509
00:56:05,042 --> 00:56:09,250
want to help you. >> I was just
going to say, remember a couple
of years ago, Dan Komensky did

510
00:56:09,250 --> 00:56:15,167
the huge DNS talk and everybody
was really spun up about it
right? I didn't know Komensky

511
00:56:15,167 --> 00:56:20,292
but I saw him at the bar. The
day before he gave his talk. And
everybody knew it was going to

512
00:56:20,292 --> 00:56:25,208
be big and it might have been
big for the people I was working
for at the time. So I grabbe him

513
00:56:25,208 --> 00:56:29,292
and pulled him off to the side
and said, what are you talking
about. And he talked to me for

514
00:56:29,292 --> 00:56:35,458
like 30 minutes, so I knew what
he was going to drop before he
even gave his talk. If you just

515
00:56:35,458 --> 00:56:40,750
walk up and talk to people
everybody here is approachable
or should be. Right? >> If

516
00:56:40,750 --> 00:56:45,792
they're not they're douche bags.
>> And fuck'em. [Laughter]
[Applause] >> And, you know,

517
00:56:45,792 --> 00:56:52,250
other people said it, but if you
hear people that are talking
about cool shit -- if you walk

518
00:56:52,250 --> 00:56:58,875
up and buy them a beer and say I
like what you're saying, can I
hang out a little bit or I have

519
00:56:58,875 --> 00:57:04,208
a question. Most people here are
-- like to talk about the shit
that they are interested in. So

520
00:57:04,208 --> 00:57:11,250
walk up and talk to them.
Alright? Find them. Ambush them
at the bar. >> Ok, in all

521
00:57:11,250 --> 00:57:16,708
fairness -- in all fairness to
Viking if you ever see Dan
Komensky drinking, he will talk

522
00:57:16,708 --> 00:57:23,333
to you. [Laughter] >> But my
point is he talked to me the day
before he gave his talk.

523
00:57:23,333 --> 00:57:28,417
Alright? So I had a little
insider knowledge only because I
walked up and spoke to him. >>

524
00:57:28,417 --> 00:57:34,417
All right, come on up here and
give us 5 things. >> Wow, those
are -- it's like, where do the

525
00:57:36,500 --> 00:57:42,500
pants end and the legs start?
[Laugher] >> So apparently I'm
pasty. [Laugher] [Applause] >>

526
00:57:55,375 --> 00:57:59,875
You probably didn't realize that
that was an introduction
statement. [Laughter] >> You sir

527
00:57:59,875 --> 00:58:05,875
with the hat. Yeah go ahead. >>
I was going to say, I would like
to object because I'm pasty. >>

528
00:58:09,458 --> 00:58:17,250
Pasties, but that's different
from Pasty. He's just one. >>
Nah, too close. Do another one

529
00:58:17,250 --> 00:58:24,542
-- >> Show us your pasties.
[Laughter] >> Please come on,
this is actually fun, he's going

530
00:58:24,542 --> 00:58:31,583
to tell the story come up here
and sit down. >> Alright, so I
was given my Handle at the first

531
00:58:31,583 --> 00:58:37,500
year of Def Con that I went to
it was Def Con 17 I went here
completely on my own, had no

532
00:58:37,500 --> 00:58:43,000
contacts, been wanting to go for
years, finally saved up, was
just freshly out of college. And

533
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:47,833
I had no idea what I was getting
into, none whatsoever, and the
first thing, Thursday morning, I

534
00:58:47,833 --> 00:58:53,792
get into the line for
registration and it's a mile
long. And I'm just standing

535
00:58:53,792 --> 00:58:59,375
there and there are these two
guys in front of me drinking
beers at 9am. [Laughter] >> I'm

536
00:58:59,375 --> 00:59:03,542
like alright cool, they just
sort of look back and they're
just like, this is your first

537
00:59:03,542 --> 00:59:07,208
time isn't it? And I'm like
yeah, and they just hand me a
six pack. By the time we got to

538
00:59:07,208 --> 00:59:13,208
the front I was well
intoxicated. [Laughter] >> And
they -- No, No >> Don't leave

539
00:59:17,875 --> 00:59:25,375
that out. >> So they convinced
me to go to Def Con 101 and me
being a little inebriated, I was

540
00:59:25,375 --> 00:59:31,375
a little bit more extroverted
then I normally was. And I got
up on stage and High asked me

541
00:59:31,375 --> 00:59:37,250
what my Handle was that I had
given myself and it was so bad
that he just shut me down and

542
00:59:37,250 --> 00:59:41,917
told me to get off the stage. He
didn't even try to give me a
Handle. But I got pushed into

543
00:59:41,917 --> 00:59:45,875
doing the scavenger hunt and I
started hanging out with
Harrison Vandel who ran the

544
00:59:45,875 --> 00:59:50,875
scavenger hunt at the time --
they're back this year, I highly
recommend you get to know them

545
00:59:50,875 --> 00:59:55,833
-- I became close friends with
them and they got me into the
Ninja Networks party and my team

546
00:59:55,833 --> 01:00:01,917
did so well Saturday night, or
up until Saturday they -- we got
into the Ninja Networks party,

547
01:00:01,917 --> 01:00:06,333
we all got way to plastered and
we couldn't submit the final
thing so are team came in

548
01:00:06,333 --> 01:00:12,292
second. And they sort of, uh, as
a consolation prize they
decided, ok well come out to the

549
01:00:12,292 --> 01:00:16,583
-- for some drinks with us and
that was the year that Harrison
Vandel got married and they gave

550
01:00:16,583 --> 01:00:22,042
everyone around us like an hour
notice. So we all scrambled to
get just something. Someone got

551
01:00:22,042 --> 01:00:28,042
them, or got Ariss a candy thong
and candy pasties as a wedding
gift. I was still belligerently

552
01:00:30,125 --> 01:00:36,542
drunk, and she said there's is
no way in hell that I am going
to wear these. So Tuna puts on

553
01:00:36,542 --> 01:00:42,542
the panties I put on the pasties
-- [Laughter] >> And we all go
to lunch at the Nascar cafe.

554
01:00:48,875 --> 01:00:54,708
[Laughter] >> And there was this
5 pound burito challenge. And
me, Tuna and one other person

555
01:00:54,708 --> 01:01:02,667
was doing it and someone tweeted
out that Def Con people were
doing this and like 20 minutes

556
01:01:02,667 --> 01:01:08,708
into this challenge one of the
security staff for the hotel --
the cafe, shows up and is like,

557
01:01:08,708 --> 01:01:13,625
who are you guys. And we're
like, we're Def Con attendees,
you know whatever. He's just

558
01:01:13,625 --> 01:01:18,875
like, you don't understand Man
vs. Food was here, we streamed
this contest online and he had

559
01:01:18,875 --> 01:01:25,750
like 86,000 followers on the
video stream. We had something
like 420,000 followers and it

560
01:01:25,750 --> 01:01:31,750
was crashing the network.
[Laughter] >> So, he just went
down and was like who are you

561
01:01:35,292 --> 01:01:39,000
guys? This is Tuna and stuff
like that and they're like who
are you? And I was like I don't

562
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:43,208
have a Handle, and they're just
like, just show him the pasties,
they're like what? So I take off

563
01:01:43,208 --> 01:01:49,208
my shirt and I keep eating my
burito. And they started
referring to me as pasties. So.

564
01:02:02,458 --> 01:02:07,708
[Applause] >> Alright, before we
get to you, does anybody have
any other questions? This is

565
01:02:07,708 --> 01:02:12,625
fun. Alright, come on over to
the mic and that way I don't
have to -- you know, the faster

566
01:02:12,625 --> 01:02:18,000
you get to the mic the front of
the line you're in. You in
orange, you had a question, you

567
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:23,292
also had a question, come on up.
Alright go ahead. >> So quick
question -- >> And all of you

568
01:02:23,292 --> 01:02:28,250
guys that are leaving, awe I am
so disappointed. >> Sit your ass
down. >> Look you're even

569
01:02:28,250 --> 01:02:35,250
laughing on the way out! >> You
can't leave. >> They're trying
to get to that porn talk next

570
01:02:35,250 --> 01:02:41,250
door. >> Ah Ok >> So this is my
fourth Def Con. Question --
[Laughter] >> If you don't

571
01:02:45,458 --> 01:02:49,250
already have it you're not doing
it right. Go ahead. >> How do
you become a Goon? >> How do you

572
01:02:49,250 --> 01:02:54,083
become a Goon! >> If you want to
help out, if you want to -- >>
You know, it really depends.

573
01:02:54,083 --> 01:03:00,000
This year we actually cut down
on a few Goons because we found
that we had a few extra things,

574
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:05,708
but find somebody who is in
charge, ask them how do I get
involved. Involve yourself on

575
01:03:05,708 --> 01:03:12,542
the Def Con forums. A lot of the
people on the forums are Goons.
Involve yourself there, and if

576
01:03:12,542 --> 01:03:20,125
we've got space, then we'll have
you help. That's kind of the
thing you know, there aren't

577
01:03:20,125 --> 01:03:27,750
really a whole lot of new Goons.
Anybody who is a Goon in general
knows somebody that is a Goon

578
01:03:27,750 --> 01:03:33,708
and has known a bunch of other
people. The security Goons, the
safety Goons, the other Red

579
01:03:33,708 --> 01:03:38,708
Shirts, sometimes they'll bring
new people in because you know
it depends on how many people

580
01:03:38,708 --> 01:03:45,667
they have. But in general,
contest Goons, speaker Goons,
events Goons, village Goons,

581
01:03:45,667 --> 01:03:51,875
production Goons, even vendor
Goons, you know if there is a
slot and your cool and we know

582
01:03:51,875 --> 01:03:56,917
you, then we want you to hang
out with us. So, that's pretty
much how it works. >> Yeah you

583
01:03:56,917 --> 01:04:02,917
got to help out. Volunteer to
help out with things and that's
how people get to know you. And

584
01:04:07,375 --> 01:04:14,750
after some years you'll know how
things run around here. >>
Basically what he is saying is

585
01:04:14,750 --> 01:04:18,875
you got to help out. Now I'm
going to give him a lot of slack
since he's been here from the

586
01:04:18,875 --> 01:04:24,875
beginning. Yeah, you don't want
to find yourself -- hey I want
to be a safety Goon and then

587
01:04:31,458 --> 01:04:39,292
realize what you might have to
do is work the 2am to 8am shift.
And get thrown up on or get, you

588
01:04:39,292 --> 01:04:46,250
know, have belligerent drunks
trying to push you out of the
way. You want to do something

589
01:04:46,250 --> 01:04:51,375
that you want to do. Again, the
comment was get involved,
volunteer. Ingratiate yourself

590
01:04:51,375 --> 01:04:57,958
to people. And demonstrate that
you can be a Goon and that we
can trust you. And in general,

591
01:04:57,958 --> 01:05:03,958
that's how you get invited to be
a Goon. >> Thank you. >> So the
abstract for this talk mentioned

592
01:05:06,542 --> 01:05:12,542
incidents involving SWAT teams
and crawling in air ducts and
I'm wondering if anybody is

593
01:05:12,542 --> 01:05:18,542
willing to share those stories.
Cause those sounded awesome. >>
Ah yes they are so -- the only

594
01:05:22,792 --> 01:05:28,167
way that what happens in Vegas
stays in Vegas is if you don't
talk about it and this should

595
01:05:28,167 --> 01:05:34,167
have been called Fight Club.
[Laughter] >> But I can tell
you, there are a lot of things

596
01:05:38,333 --> 01:05:45,042
-- I have been involved not
quite as long as Aaron and
certainly not, yeah. Anyway, and

597
01:05:45,042 --> 01:05:50,417
there are things, the mentality
is it's not really just a Hacker
conference, I mean, you

598
01:05:50,417 --> 01:05:56,417
challenge the status quo and so
we have had people that have
done all kinds of stuff. And the

599
01:05:59,500 --> 01:06:04,792
SWAT teams yeah I wasn't there
for that but I was there when
people got thrown out of the

600
01:06:04,792 --> 01:06:11,375
hotel for actually throwing
things out the hotel window. >>
That takes talent. >> Yeah,

601
01:06:11,375 --> 01:06:18,042
refrigerator -- [Laughter] >>
Parking the golf cart in the
Alexis Park pool. >> Yeah, you

602
01:06:18,042 --> 01:06:23,917
know or turning the pool, there
were three pools at the Alexis
Park turning them three

603
01:06:23,917 --> 01:06:29,792
different colors. [Laughter] >>
We always knew it was time to
leave the Alexis when the

604
01:06:29,792 --> 01:06:36,417
fountain was purple. >> Yes,
when the fountain was purple or
when some of that astro turf the

605
01:06:36,417 --> 01:06:42,417
Jim would make angels in was
peeled up. There are a lot of
really fun stories and you know,

606
01:06:45,917 --> 01:06:52,333
Highways initially envisioned
this as being a lets reminisce
about Def Con because what he

607
01:06:52,333 --> 01:06:58,542
wanted to do was to tell you all
these fun stories and then kind
of give you an idea of where it

608
01:06:58,542 --> 01:07:03,667
is evolved too. One year at the
Riviera we all got kicked out of
the pool because there was a

609
01:07:03,667 --> 01:07:09,667
swarm of killer bees. Kind of
fun stuff, you know, not quite
the SWAT thing, but crawling in

610
01:07:11,958 --> 01:07:17,375
the -- the guys will do
anything. And that was it, you
challenge the status quo. Kind

611
01:07:17,375 --> 01:07:23,292
of funny -- the Alexis Park was
where most of this stuff
happened. I remember people

612
01:07:23,292 --> 01:07:28,083
hacking the point of sales
system behind the bar while the
bartender was there. You know,

613
01:07:28,083 --> 01:07:35,583
all kinds of fun stuff or the
moment that the Alexis Park
realized that maybe you

614
01:07:35,583 --> 01:07:39,875
shouldn't have an ATM there that
can just spit out money do
whoever knows the code. You

615
01:07:39,875 --> 01:07:45,542
know, those sort of things. You
know, we've had a lot of fun and
there have been some crazy

616
01:07:45,542 --> 01:07:53,125
things and if you really want
some fun stories, participate in
the scavenger hunt and talk to

617
01:07:53,125 --> 01:07:58,708
Civiack. >> What was the Handle?
>> What's that? >> What was the
Handle? >> Civiak. It's his

618
01:07:58,708 --> 01:08:05,917
birthday today. It truly is his
birthday, so if you find him,
wish him a happy birthday, give

619
01:08:05,917 --> 01:08:12,292
him a hug. And ask him to tell
you some stories. Civiak is a
lot of fun. Civiak has shown up

620
01:08:12,292 --> 01:08:18,292
in life vests from airplanes and
all kinds of stuff. [Laughter]
>> There used to be a problem at

621
01:08:20,958 --> 01:08:26,958
the Alexis Park, people like to
get up on the roof, it's only a
two story facility there and it

622
01:08:29,292 --> 01:08:35,292
was two wasn't it. >> Yeah just
two. >> So, people liked to get
on the roof and you know,

623
01:08:38,208 --> 01:08:43,083
usually it was pretty innocuous,
they wouldn't -- maybe they
would throw ping pong balls or

624
01:08:43,083 --> 01:08:48,208
something, I believe somebody
did a beer bong off the roof. >>
Woah, woah, woah. >> That's a

625
01:08:48,208 --> 01:08:55,833
three story beer bong. >> Yeah,
cause it was up and then they
were at the pool. Which was good

626
01:08:55,833 --> 01:09:02,292
for them because they needed it.
[Laughter] >> A skimmer, they
needed a skimmer after that. >>

627
01:09:02,292 --> 01:09:08,042
So, the people on the roof go in
through access doors they
shouldn't go through just to

628
01:09:08,042 --> 01:09:14,375
find out -- the Alexis Park had
an extensive -- they're not like
tunnels but there's basically

629
01:09:14,375 --> 01:09:19,083
ways to get around the
convention space that only the
employees knew. And then the

630
01:09:19,083 --> 01:09:23,708
Goons knew and then anybody the
could open the doors that they
never kept locked knew. And so

631
01:09:23,708 --> 01:09:29,625
it was pretty routine to try to
find your quickest way through
to get between talk to talk. Or

632
01:09:29,625 --> 01:09:36,208
get up on places like the roof
or things like that. >> Yeah.
It's been, you know as Def Con

633
01:09:36,208 --> 01:09:41,875
has grown and people like myself
are approaching 50, it does make
it you know -- all the sudden

634
01:09:41,875 --> 01:09:47,667
the appeal of -- I might
actually fall through this, you
know, all the sudden the appeals

635
01:09:47,667 --> 01:09:53,375
is a little bit lost. It's lost
some of it's luster, but we can
talk about some stories

636
01:09:53,375 --> 01:09:59,375
afterwards. >> Cool >> Did you
have another question. >> No >>
Ok. Cool. >> But I do not have a

637
01:10:01,958 --> 01:10:08,083
Handle either so. >> Ok we'll
we're not getting -- you're not
bumping the line buddy. >> Huh?

638
01:10:08,083 --> 01:10:15,000
>> Hold on. Alright so let's go
ahead. This gentleman in the
fancy haberdashery hat is going

639
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:21,000
to introduce himself, probably
not as I am Pasty. [Laughter] >>
And try to get himself a Handle

640
01:10:23,042 --> 01:10:30,500
>> So five things about myself?
>> Five things. >> Ok, alright,
first thing is this is my second

641
01:10:30,500 --> 01:10:37,292
Def Con, I guess, that's a
really shitty thing. I guess, I
am -- I've been trying to get a

642
01:10:37,292 --> 01:10:41,708
Handle for awhile. I can never
come up with a creative one
unfortunately, I've gone by a

643
01:10:41,708 --> 01:10:47,708
couple. Let's see here. Speaking
of getting on roofs I own a mag
stripe read writer because I

644
01:10:50,458 --> 01:10:57,250
like drinking beer on the roof.
I saw this up in the room and I
was like, hey, they are giving

645
01:10:57,250 --> 01:11:03,458
out handles and I had enough
beer so I thought it was a good
idea to immediately sprint down

646
01:11:03,458 --> 01:11:10,042
here and try to do this, but I
tried to buy a Handle on the way
to trade you a Handle for a

647
01:11:10,042 --> 01:11:14,917
Handle, but they don't sell them
in the store, unfortunately. And
I'm probably going to stop

648
01:11:14,917 --> 01:11:20,917
rambling and let you -- >> Nah,
nah, so far you haven't really
told us anything -- >> About

649
01:11:24,125 --> 01:11:30,125
myself? [Laughter] >> Rambles!
>> The best part about this is
that you guys are so much better

650
01:11:32,250 --> 01:11:38,208
at this then I am. [Laughter] >>
Rambles, go ahead slash Nick
Rambles. Really, you are going

651
01:11:38,208 --> 01:11:44,208
to come up with a cat shirt.
[Laughter] >> Why yes! Yes I am.
>> Alright, go ahead. >> My

652
01:11:51,667 --> 01:11:57,667
question is, I saw a talk at
Blackhat that scared the crap
out of me. And while I was

653
01:12:00,042 --> 01:12:05,083
sitting and listening to the
talk I started thinking of
mitigations, for the talk. And

654
01:12:05,083 --> 01:12:12,667
I'm wondering if I'm able to
come up with mitigations and
would like to submit them to

655
01:12:12,667 --> 01:12:19,625
share them with other people.
What's the best way of keeping
my professional life isolated

656
01:12:19,625 --> 01:12:27,583
from my presentation life so to
speak. >> Yeah, your Handle. >>
I'm at the right spot for a

657
01:12:27,583 --> 01:12:33,000
solution! >> Yeah. There a lot
of a different ways, but the
easiest way is to truly

658
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:39,583
distinguish yourself, you know,
you can be passwod@gmail.com.
It's no longer being used.

659
01:12:39,583 --> 01:12:45,583
[Laughter] >> The ah, you can,
realistically what you want to
do is be able to get -- most

660
01:12:45,583 --> 01:12:51,083
companies have some sort of bug
submission or you know, a lot of
companies, you might even

661
01:12:51,083 --> 01:12:57,083
consider this bug bounties, and
there are different ways that
you can disclose this in a

662
01:13:01,583 --> 01:13:08,542
reasonable way. It's certainly
helpful. Also you're capable of
speaking and being two different

663
01:13:08,542 --> 01:13:15,667
people because for a lot of us
we might work for companies like
Viking does, where you don't

664
01:13:15,667 --> 01:13:20,125
necessarily want to be
associated with that
organization and the

665
01:13:20,125 --> 01:13:25,375
organization probably doesn't
want him to be associated with
them. And so there's lots of

666
01:13:25,375 --> 01:13:31,792
different ways you can do it.
And the easiest way is to start
getting involved with the

667
01:13:31,792 --> 01:13:37,292
community and certainly approach
the company -- if you have a
mitigation something that can do

668
01:13:37,292 --> 01:13:43,333
it. Approach them, if it simply
is a strategy then you might
consider giving a talk about it.

669
01:13:43,333 --> 01:13:51,208
Write a white paper or something
of that nature. If it is an
actual fix then definitely you

670
01:13:51,208 --> 01:13:55,542
want to get with that company if
it's a patch or something like
that. >> Ok >> Alright? >> Thank

671
01:13:55,542 --> 01:13:59,542
you. >> Yes. >> I'm getting
pulled off for other things. >>
Hey, have a good time. Oh yeah I

672
01:13:59,542 --> 01:14:05,667
am, look at that. According to
my storm trooper it's ten after
six. >> Are we going to come up

673
01:14:05,667 --> 01:14:10,333
with a solution or no? >> A
solution, do you want to come up
with a solution? >> It sounds

674
01:14:10,333 --> 01:14:15,500
like I need a solution. >> Ok.
[Laughter] >> I was under the
impression -- >> I need a

675
01:14:15,500 --> 01:14:21,625
Handle. >> Oh, you need a Handle
>> I need a Handle. >> The man
needs a Handle. >> Alright. >>

676
01:14:21,625 --> 01:14:26,542
I'm in desperate need. >> Sky
Talks? That's a horrible handle.
[Laughter] >> As a solution. >>

677
01:14:26,542 --> 01:14:31,500
You know, Sky Talks actually is
a good example, you know they
have the lightning talks they

678
01:14:31,500 --> 01:14:36,708
have where you can just
basically get up -- you can try
a little improve talk. Yeah. Now

679
01:14:36,708 --> 01:14:42,417
if what you want to do is sit
around and discuss this and come
up with a solution, then I'm

680
01:14:42,417 --> 01:14:48,208
going to guess that -- >> The
solution to my problem being
that I needed a Handle. >> Ah,

681
01:14:48,208 --> 01:14:54,292
you need a Handle. Ok so.
[Laughter] >> Go ahead and let's
ah -- >> I guess the first thing

682
01:14:54,292 --> 01:15:00,333
is you commented on the shirt,
yes there is a cat on my shirt.
It's a mad cat and you're

683
01:15:00,333 --> 01:15:04,917
encouraged to join the
revolution. I wore it because
there was the cavalry talk and

684
01:15:04,917 --> 01:15:11,250
ah -- it's actually from a pet
store in Madison Wisconsin. But
the join the revolution struck a

685
01:15:11,250 --> 01:15:18,958
chord and I thought it was
appropriate to wear it here at
my third Def Con. Things about

686
01:15:18,958 --> 01:15:25,833
me? I'm a hardware guy. I;m a
device physicist, I'm a
programmer, play a lot of

687
01:15:25,833 --> 01:15:31,542
tennis, from Texas, we've got
some other Texans floating
around here. But I grew up in

688
01:15:31,542 --> 01:15:37,542
the mid-west. I'm not very
interesting -- [Laughter] >>
What's that? >> Tennis kitty. >>

689
01:15:45,917 --> 01:15:51,917
Tennis kitty. Yeah, no. We're
not going to do that. >> Green
balls. >> Fuzzy green balls no

690
01:15:54,083 --> 01:16:00,875
less. >> You know what? >> You
are Green Bees. Green balls and
you are GB. We are going to call

691
01:16:00,875 --> 01:16:06,125
you GB for short. >> GB, very
good. >> Green Balls! >>
Alright, Mister Orange. You

692
01:16:06,125 --> 01:16:10,500
wanted a Handle. And we're going
to do one more and then I am
going to go ahead and wrap this

693
01:16:10,500 --> 01:16:16,500
up. I will be happy to answer
questions afterwards though. >>
So I grew up hanging out a lot

694
01:16:19,458 --> 01:16:26,583
at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory.
And just my dad was an engineer
there -- ended up sort of

695
01:16:26,583 --> 01:16:34,250
getting into the family --
family profession myself. Do ah
-- learn hardware and embed

696
01:16:34,250 --> 01:16:40,250
systems and always done sort of
software and system admin on the
side. I'm a cyclist. Met another

697
01:16:44,667 --> 01:16:50,792
one who talked about growing up
as kids of people in the
national labs as bean brats. And

698
01:16:50,792 --> 01:16:56,792
let's see what else about me. >>
Ten Speed sounds good. Now
Berkeley is where they don't

699
01:16:59,208 --> 01:17:07,000
have lawn mowers, they have
goats. >> Lab Rat. >> Come on.
Lab Rat is good too. I am happy

700
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:11,333
with Ten Speed. And Ten Speed is
a good story -- has a good story
behind it, so. We're going to go

701
01:17:11,333 --> 01:17:17,333
with Ten Speed. >> Thank you.
[Applause] >> I do not need a
Handle, I already have one. It's

702
01:17:22,500 --> 01:17:26,625
more of a story. >> Really?
Let's hear your Handle and
decide if you actually do have

703
01:17:26,625 --> 01:17:34,292
one. >> Well the story comes
with the Handle. So, my first
Def Con was 9. At the time I was

704
01:17:34,292 --> 01:17:41,750
an illegal so it was very
difficult to come in here. I had
to take the bus and I didn't

705
01:17:41,750 --> 01:17:47,500
speak English. So I made it. I
didn't know anyone and I was
afraid cause everyone looked

706
01:17:47,500 --> 01:17:54,583
totally different and I was
scared. Prior to that I got the
Handle because I was in LA and I

707
01:17:54,583 --> 01:17:59,958
ended up going to the LA 2,600
meeting. I didn't know anyone,
so they asked me, well what's

708
01:17:59,958 --> 01:18:05,375
your Handle. And the first thing
that came to my mind -- they had
computers out there. And there

709
01:18:05,375 --> 01:18:12,833
was a plug and I said, that. So
I just pointed to it and I said,
plug. And that was it, so that

710
01:18:12,833 --> 01:18:17,167
was the only thing I could say.
But so I was only in the
shadows. So I know a lot of the

711
01:18:17,167 --> 01:18:21,208
people through faces, because I
never really interacted with
them. It was a problem that I

712
01:18:21,208 --> 01:18:27,208
had because I felt that I
couldn't speak and I limited
myself. So then I came to 10, 11

713
01:18:29,458 --> 01:18:36,542
and still was illegal. So
finally by Def Con 13 I got
papers and I was so happy. So

714
01:18:36,542 --> 01:18:43,250
anyways, then I got a ride with
a guy that was -- Strom Carlson.
He was doing, Hacking the

715
01:18:43,250 --> 01:18:49,250
Asterisks and actually that Def
Con, which I believe was the
last one at Alexis, he did the

716
01:18:51,875 --> 01:18:55,667
mailbox, I think right? The
switchboard? I think they had
something like that. Anyways we

717
01:18:55,667 --> 01:19:00,500
were driving in the car and I
was always scarred right, cause
I was always taking the buses so

718
01:19:00,500 --> 01:19:05,167
no one could see me. And so this
time he was driving too fast
cause we need to get there early

719
01:19:05,167 --> 01:19:11,667
to setup everything and then.
Woooo. Police. So he was like
ahhhhh. He's all mad and pissed

720
01:19:11,667 --> 01:19:18,208
cause he needed to get in. Well
I was actually trying to hide.
Because in my mind I was still

721
01:19:18,208 --> 01:19:22,917
thinking like, prior to that. So
this police officer comes in as
is like, registration and what

722
01:19:22,917 --> 01:19:29,000
not. And I'm just sweating and
shaking right? And he looks at
me like what's going on? And I

723
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:33,542
didn't really say anything right
but in after -- for a minute I
thought well wait a second I'm

724
01:19:33,542 --> 01:19:39,250
not worried anymore, I got
papers. You know. So anyways we
stopped and we took a break. And

725
01:19:39,250 --> 01:19:44,292
finally one day I decided I'm
going to interact more with
people. So what I decided to do

726
01:19:44,292 --> 01:19:49,875
is I went back home and I
decided to tackle terminology
and try to get it to pronounce

727
01:19:49,875 --> 01:19:54,708
it better. So when I talk to
people they will not look at my
mouth and then we will have a

728
01:19:54,708 --> 01:20:01,667
really good conversation. So
here I am presenting my story
and hopefully it helps people

729
01:20:01,667 --> 01:20:05,208
because another thing that I
realized is through all the
years one of the things that has

730
01:20:05,208 --> 01:20:11,208
striked me is, I could never see
people from my own country. And
I couldn't even see Latinos for

731
01:20:13,333 --> 01:20:17,625
a long period of time. And it
was until recently when the
first people I saw was from

732
01:20:17,625 --> 01:20:24,375
Spain then we got the guys from
Argentina and then Columbia and
so forth. But if it's difficult

733
01:20:24,375 --> 01:20:29,292
for someone like me it shouldn't
be difficult for anyone that
speaks the language. And you

734
01:20:29,292 --> 01:20:34,583
should not be afraid to do
anything and I had probably a
valid reason, didn't have papers

735
01:20:34,583 --> 01:20:39,375
or anything, but nothing should
stop you from not making
friends. And what I decided to

736
01:20:39,375 --> 01:20:44,167
do now is hang out at the bar
and if someone wants a beer,
I'll just buy them a beer and I

737
01:20:44,167 --> 01:20:48,625
have a conversation with them
cause it's the only thing I can
do. And try to break from not

738
01:20:48,625 --> 01:20:55,833
being social with people, but I
try my best. So, just to end
this thing the first person that

739
01:20:55,833 --> 01:21:03,333
I met in LA 2,600 was actually
Noid. He used to run the Goons.
The second person I met at the

740
01:21:03,333 --> 01:21:10,458
time, Lost, I think it was in LA
cause that was the first person
and I thought he spoke Spanish

741
01:21:10,458 --> 01:21:14,625
cause -- I started to
communicate with him and the
third person, that really

742
01:21:14,625 --> 01:21:22,333
intimidated me, it was Petty
Lasterine. He's a huge tall man.
Yeah. So, I was really freaked

743
01:21:22,333 --> 01:21:27,250
out cause he looked like a punk
rocker and stuff. And I just
thought oh my god this is going

744
01:21:27,250 --> 01:21:31,500
to be scary. So, but you can
meet a lot of great people. Do
interact with them. It's always

745
01:21:31,500 --> 01:21:37,500
fun and, you know, I'm glad that
I became part of this culture.
It's been life changing for me.

746
01:21:48,583 --> 01:21:53,125
I now work in security. I do
things that I really like and
I've learned a lot of this stuff

747
01:21:53,125 --> 01:21:56,708
from the people that I met
through this conferences so.
That's it. >> Thank you very

748
01:21:56,708 --> 01:21:58,708
much Plug. [Applause]
