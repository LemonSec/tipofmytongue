00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Good afternoon, everybody. In my
time zone it's quite late. I
have one watch for each time

2
00:00:09,292 --> 00:00:14,250
zone. I'm trying to keep track
of things. I'm very happy to be
here. I presented a few

3
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:18,500
conferences, various places all
over the world. This is my first
DEF CON ever. I'm really really

4
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:22,667
excited to be here and really
happy to have such a big
turnout. So, thank you for

5
00:00:22,667 --> 00:00:28,917
everyone coming along. What I
will be talking about stuff that
really excites me and stuff I'm

6
00:00:28,917 --> 00:00:33,750
passionate about. What I hope is
that you guys will see it's cool
and you guys will get excited

7
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:39,625
to. Maybe we can collaborate and
come up with some ideas
together. All of you guys put

8
00:00:39,625 --> 00:00:47,000
together are much much smarter
than me. Perhaps I can follow
some ideas and we can take it

9
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:53,083
somewhere else together. So,
today's talk: Practical Aerial
Hacking and Surveillance. I'm

10
00:00:53,083 --> 00:00:59,083
Glen. Now, this is a story of
one fly‑away, two broken rotor
arms, three cut fingers which

11
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:12,125
have sense healed, and 12,000
lines of code. I couldn't find
enough iteration's to go from 3

12
00:01:12,125 --> 00:01:18,125
to 12,000 so I skipped a few
there. But, just to tell you a
little bit about myself, my name

13
00:01:22,125 --> 00:01:27,292
is Glen. My lucky number is 11.
If you do the whole Twitter
thing, you can bug me on

14
00:01:27,292 --> 00:01:33,958
Twitter. I'm originally from
Zimbabwe, a small land locked
country in southern Africa.

15
00:01:33,958 --> 00:01:41,792
Anyone heard of Zimbabwe?
[Cheers and Applause]. >> Been
to Zimbabwe? Aw man..one guy..

16
00:01:41,792 --> 00:01:49,042
two guys. You are all invited.
It's a lovely country. As a road
scholar, I studied at the

17
00:01:49,042 --> 00:01:55,625
University of Oxford. I have my
Computer science Masters degree
from there. I currently work at

18
00:01:55,625 --> 00:02:00,208
a small penetration testing
company called Sense Post. Our
main office is in south Africa.

19
00:02:00,208 --> 00:02:05,917
I work for the London office. I
mostly do penetration testing.
Recently, I have been running a

20
00:02:05,917 --> 00:02:09,917
small innovations center, a
small innovations lab. An
awesome place to work. I'm

21
00:02:09,917 --> 00:02:15,792
really really happy there. Part
of what we do at Sense Post is
all our guys get 20% research

22
00:02:15,792 --> 00:02:22,208
time, and in that time we get to
go play with cool stuff and get
flown into conferences and have

23
00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:28,833
a whole lot of fun. As I
mentioned, I spoken to a few
conference before, all over the

24
00:02:28,833 --> 00:02:36,667
world from an Moscow to Paris to
south Africa and other places.
I'm occasionally on the news.

25
00:02:36,667 --> 00:02:43,083
Enough about me. I'd like to
welcome those of you who were
here last year. Very briefly in

26
00:02:43,083 --> 00:02:50,083
about 10 minutes of having a
quick look, you can see about 20
or 30 of you in this room that

27
00:02:50,083 --> 00:02:56,125
were here last year. Welcome
back. I will tell you a little
about that later. Welcome to

28
00:02:56,125 --> 00:03:02,125
those of you who are traveling
quite far abroad. I see people
here from all over the world

29
00:03:04,875 --> 00:03:11,708
who, although at a security
conference are not very security
conscious. [Laughter]. >> Enough

30
00:03:11,708 --> 00:03:17,708
about that. Let's get into the
actual talk. The title of the
talk is Practical Aerial Hacking

31
00:03:19,958 --> 00:03:26,708
and Surveillance. It's a whole
bunch of funny stuff right
there. What do I actually mean

32
00:03:26,708 --> 00:03:32,708
and what is this all about? So,
sometimes back, I kind of had
the idea I've seen a lot of

33
00:03:34,833 --> 00:03:40,917
stuff in the media about drones
and flying machines. I have
always loved RC stuff. RC cars

34
00:03:40,917 --> 00:03:46,542
and RC Plains as a kid and more
recently, these slightly more
complex ones. I notice it

35
00:03:46,542 --> 00:03:53,458
started getting quite a bad name
in the media. I don't call this
thing a drone anymore. I call it

36
00:03:53,458 --> 00:03:58,958
a UAV or my toy helicopter. You
say drone, people look funny and
get uncomfortable. Interesting

37
00:03:58,958 --> 00:04:04,458
feeling Growing up as a
teen‑ager and kind of getting
into hacker scene and wanting to

38
00:04:04,458 --> 00:04:10,333
be a hacker and learning stuff
back then, I've told someone
that you were a hacker or

39
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:15,125
hacking stuff, they had a
negative reaction and didn't
feel quite comfortable with you.

40
00:04:15,125 --> 00:04:21,667
They knew in the media they had
seen hacking is bad and hackers
are terrible and must go to

41
00:04:21,667 --> 00:04:27,875
jail. I think now we've kind of
progressed and society has kind
of accepted us and things are

42
00:04:27,875 --> 00:04:34,500
much warmer. Now I get the same
feeling when I talk about drones
and these flying machines, I

43
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:39,667
think because the way things are
portrayed in the media. People
are unsure and uncomfortable.

44
00:04:39,667 --> 00:04:45,583
People just don't understand
them. That's probably fuelled by
all the terrible reports we see

45
00:04:45,583 --> 00:04:51,500
about drones and foreign
countries dropping bombs and
take over the world and all

46
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:57,500
sorts of things. I thought we
were kind of on par. A month ago
I cut up my fingers really bad

47
00:04:59,667 --> 00:05:07,000
so. We still have quite a nice
relationship. I also noticed
that in the media all kind of

48
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:13,292
stories about drones being used
for surveillance, data
interception, not so much data

49
00:05:13,292 --> 00:05:18,583
interception side a lot on
surveillance and cameras and
old‑school surveillance. A

50
00:05:18,583 --> 00:05:25,625
little bit on more digital
surveillance. I got to thinking,
that looks fun. I love flying

51
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:33,125
things and I hacking. Maybe I
can take those two passions and
put these two together and

52
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:39,708
create my own aerial hacking
machine. That's where my story
started. I wanted to put

53
00:05:39,708 --> 00:05:44,583
something together for
myself that was affordable and
doesn't cost millions of

54
00:05:44,583 --> 00:05:50,750
dollars, comprised of off‑the
shelf hardware and open sourced
software that anybody can build.

55
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:56,750
I also had a few other
requirements. I wanted to build
possibly a range of devices. I

56
00:05:56,750 --> 00:06:02,833
wanted something that had both
short range and agility and also
some long‑range. Something I

57
00:06:02,833 --> 00:06:08,625
could fly for 10s or hundreds or
maybe even thousands of
kilometers and operate in

58
00:06:08,625 --> 00:06:15,875
altitudes beyond what we call
the audio horizon or visual
horizon. Higher than you can see

59
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:23,500
or hear it, or it will detect
what's going on down below. Low
noise and low visibility. Quite

60
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:29,500
often I find when I talk about
this stuff, people say if I see
it buzzing around my head, I

61
00:06:32,042 --> 00:06:38,042
will shoot it or swat it or
something. That's not going to
happen when it's a 300 feet and

62
00:06:40,125 --> 00:06:46,917
bearing 1600 kilometers an hour.
Sorry. I talked a lot ‑‑ yeah.
The slide ‑‑ that's the right

63
00:06:46,917 --> 00:06:50,750
slide. Don't worry. I don't like
having lots of text. It
distracts you guys and won't pay

64
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:56,750
attention. Watch me and don't
worry about that. I also wanted
to have a range of senses. Both

65
00:07:00,958 --> 00:07:05,917
kind of standard senses, like
video and the elementary which
is fairly standard for these

66
00:07:05,917 --> 00:07:12,083
flying machines.Then also Couple
that with a degree of stuff that
I'm good at. So, hacking and

67
00:07:12,083 --> 00:07:19,458
data interception and those
kinds of things. I also wanted
to have a degree of autonomous

68
00:07:19,458 --> 00:07:24,250
flights. So, not just a radio
controller and kind of buzzing
around the room here. I wanted

69
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:30,458
to be able to fly a long way and
for it to be able to fly itself
there and fly back. If anything

70
00:07:30,458 --> 00:07:34,375
goes wrong, it should be able to
fly itself home. Those are the
ideas that I kind of put

71
00:07:34,375 --> 00:08:02,292
together. [Applause]. >> I heard
rumor of this. [Laughter]. >> At
the London hack space where I

72
00:08:02,292 --> 00:08:08,667
fly allot, we have an
appreciation, don't drink and
drone. >> Well, new speaker,

73
00:08:08,667 --> 00:08:32,667
show him some love. (Applause).
(Cheers and applause). >> He's
watching YouTube. [Chuckles]. >>

74
00:08:32,667 --> 00:08:44,042
Thank you. So, now that my mind
is clear ‑‑ [Laughter]. >> So
the idea was, I saw a lot of

75
00:08:44,042 --> 00:08:49,958
this drone activity in the
media, I like building drones
and flying drones, I thought hey

76
00:08:49,958 --> 00:08:53,625
can I make my own surveillance
drones? I built one and I would
like to tell you a story about

77
00:08:53,625 --> 00:08:59,583
how I built it. Some of the
reports that I said I'v seen in
the media, If you search with

78
00:08:59,583 --> 00:09:05,000
drone and data interception or
something like that, you get
lots and lots of results. If you

79
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:12,083
hear eyes of a Compton, police
spy whole city with some high
altitude drone, CIA flew self

80
00:09:12,083 --> 00:09:23,125
drones in Pakistan. U.S. army
humming bird, A 160 humming
bird. 1.8 pixel camera. That can

81
00:09:23,125 --> 00:09:30,500
track people down to this kind
of size from 20,000 feet, which
is pretty cool. It can track 65

82
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:36,000
people at the same time. It is
really bad ass. This one is
fairly recent. African firm

83
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:43,708
selling pepper spray bullet
firing drones. That guy on the
bottom on the far side is called

84
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:49,458
"the skunk." It's a 6 rotar
fairly big one. It's got Four
paint ball terrets. It shoots

85
00:09:49,458 --> 00:09:57,708
pepper spray pellets, It's got a
strobe lights and loud speakers
and its actually terrifying.

86
00:09:57,708 --> 00:10:07,042
[Laughter]. >> So if you ever do
come to south Africa, watch out
for those guys. [Chuckles]. >>

87
00:10:07,042 --> 00:10:14,208
Now, one thing I'm trying to be
vigilant of, if you know a guy
named Haroon Ame, that's him not

88
00:10:14,208 --> 00:10:22,042
in the armor, excellent security
researcher. He had this talk ‑‑
I will talk about him. He kind

89
00:10:22,042 --> 00:10:27,708
of warned the security industry
not to be "contetaionors" as he
called them. So, just don't just

90
00:10:27,708 --> 00:10:32,750
entertain the crowd. Actually do
something interesting proper
research. I am hoping today

91
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:37,375
maybe I can do both, entertain
you guys and have some
interesting research, or at

92
00:10:37,375 --> 00:10:42,417
least a few interesting stories.
At least on the note of the
drone stuff, I have seen a whole

93
00:10:42,417 --> 00:10:49,083
bunch of stories in the media,
you take an existing hack, some
duct tape and strap it to an off

94
00:10:49,083 --> 00:10:54,708
the shelf drone and portray it
as something terrifying and new
and interesting. I'm bit

95
00:10:54,708 --> 00:11:02,708
suspicious of those types of
stories. Hopefully I'm not doing
that. It's up to you guys to

96
00:11:02,708 --> 00:11:10,500
judge me. Okay, An overview of
my aerial hacking and
surveilling unit. We have four

97
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:17,083
considerations that I went
through in building this thing.
One, I needed an aerial

98
00:11:17,083 --> 00:11:23,333
platform. So, some kind of
Flying machine unrelated to
snooping and data interception.

99
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:27,875
Just something to carry the tech
around. A few considerations
when deciding what kind of

100
00:11:27,875 --> 00:11:37,500
solution is best for you. The
next point and degree of ground
control-otomation. How do you

101
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,833
fly the thing? Do you use a
controller like this or do you
fly it from your iPhone or is it

102
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:45,708
fully autonomous or something
else perhaps? How does the damn
thing fly? The interesting, the

103
00:11:45,708 --> 00:11:53,375
payload, the hacking pay load.
What form factor should it be?
Big, small, high‑powered and

104
00:11:53,375 --> 00:12:01,667
what software and how does it do
it's thing? Finally, a degree of
methodology. How do you get this

105
00:12:01,667 --> 00:12:14,375
thing to do its business? Can
the stuff actually be used
practically? The word practical.

106
00:12:14,375 --> 00:12:18,375
I want this stuff to be not much
of the stunt hacking, something
actually useful. I look at the

107
00:12:18,375 --> 00:12:23,000
methodology and a few use cases
that are quite interesting. I am
sure between us there are a

108
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:30,583
bunch of you who can come up
with an interesting use cases
yourself. First point, the

109
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:36,750
aerial platform. The actual
flying machine. At least four
considerations, probably a few

110
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:41,167
more but four serious one. First
decision, Do you want to use
multi-rotor or fixed wing?

111
00:12:41,167 --> 00:12:48,083
Multi-rotor just means lots of
propellors. Essentially, Three
is minimum. Three, four, five,

112
00:12:48,083 --> 00:12:54,542
up to eight. You can get some
octocopter, so eight propellers.
Sometimes you have top and

113
00:12:54,542 --> 00:12:59,333
bottom. So one motor up and one
motor down. Then you have 16.
Those are gargantuan. The

114
00:12:59,333 --> 00:13:07,833
considerations you need to make
are, are you lifting very heavy
stuff? What is your flight time

115
00:13:07,833 --> 00:13:12,333
that is required? What is the
actual size of the copter? The
big ones like 16 rotors or

116
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:20,917
something. That's great if you
need to carry a barrel of beer
or something which is actually a

117
00:13:20,917 --> 00:13:27,000
good business idea. We tried it
in South Africa but got shut
down. [Laughter]. >> For our

118
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:36,708
purposes, this kind of size is
sufficient for carrying the
payload. I'v got a much smaller

119
00:13:36,708 --> 00:13:41,708
one that first post you saw, the
fly‑away, I just finished
building it for the conference.

120
00:13:41,708 --> 00:13:45,667
I tested it in London. My first
flight after a month of building
it just for you guys and it flew

121
00:13:45,667 --> 00:13:50,458
away and clearly didn't want to
come. If you know guys in london
and they find a small quad

122
00:13:50,458 --> 00:13:54,625
copter, please bring it back to
me. This kind of size is pretty
good. It can carry about 300

123
00:13:54,625 --> 00:14:00,583
gram pay load. We will see you
in a little bit. That's
perfectly sufficient but in

124
00:14:00,583 --> 00:14:04,958
terms of distance, we may need a
fixed wing and see you on the
next flight a little bit more

125
00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:10,583
about that. The flight
controller, that's the brains.
So, the squad copter drone

126
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:19,292
things, they have what's called
a flight control. It's just the
brains. It's that unit on top.

127
00:14:19,292 --> 00:14:27,458
This one ‑‑ this one is base and
all kinds of interesting
functions. The kind of base for

128
00:14:27,458 --> 00:14:33,708
flight controller is that it has
some degree of orientation, so
they have different ones

129
00:14:33,708 --> 00:14:40,833
different properties. At least a
gyro scope, a barometer, how
high it is, those kind of stance

130
00:14:40,833 --> 00:14:46,042
so it knows its orientation. It
actually makes them easy to fly.
It's much easier than a

131
00:14:46,042 --> 00:14:50,125
helicopter or any other
traditional RC unit. Basically I
just say go up, and the computer

132
00:14:50,125 --> 00:14:58,708
decides, I need to put this
power this motor, this one. The
wings, compensate and go this

133
00:14:58,708 --> 00:15:07,000
way. Because of control, its
incredebly easy to fly. The
awesome decision what to get.

134
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:13,708
It's almost like the O S wars.
Cameras..we have a few different
kinds of cameras. Essentially,

135
00:15:13,708 --> 00:15:22,042
do you want high‑resolution,
long range, short range, FPV,
infrared, and GPS. GPS has two

136
00:15:22,042 --> 00:15:29,167
functions. The bit sticking out
that one is GPS use navigation
so it knows where it is. It's

137
00:15:29,167 --> 00:15:41,667
useful if I tell it to fly 10
clicks that way, or if it's a
strong wind and being blown off

138
00:15:41,667 --> 00:15:44,750
course, it knows I'm off course.
I need to compensate and go a
little more east. Also GPS units

139
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:48,417
I will talk about later.
Essentially, if I lose it, it
flies away, or if it gets

140
00:15:48,417 --> 00:15:54,917
captured, It has a homing beacon
on it. I can send a text message
to the homing beacon and a text

141
00:15:54,917 --> 00:16:03,250
back with its GPS coordinates.
So in this picture here, you
have wing versus multi rotor. An

142
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:09,583
example of a winged unit on the
side here. So the wing units
vary from very very small to the

143
00:16:09,583 --> 00:16:16,875
penguins. One my favorites.The
Penguins really big, an
interesting one. It comes down

144
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:25,250
to largely your payload and
range. This guy about 300 gram
payload, about 15 minutes.

145
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:31,333
That's useful for different
scenarios. So say if I need to
do a short distance or go on the

146
00:16:31,333 --> 00:16:36,917
side of a building or land on a
roof or something. If you want a
longer range, guys like the

147
00:16:36,917 --> 00:16:44,583
penguins you can get about 300
kilometers range out of them.
So, you can effectively scour an

148
00:16:44,583 --> 00:16:52,750
entire country or at least
across a few states, or a few
borders. Long range or short

149
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:58,833
range depending on a few
criteria. Low noise and decent
payload. In the end, I kind of

150
00:16:58,833 --> 00:17:09,583
realized this is a good form
factor. So, 4 rotor and about 40
centameter in diameter and also

151
00:17:09,583 --> 00:17:12,042
a bigger fixed wing plane which
I couldn't bring here because
it's really big but for

152
00:17:12,042 --> 00:17:17,542
longer‑range missions. The
flight controller, which I
briefly mentioned. The brains of

153
00:17:17,542 --> 00:17:24,292
the unit. So, the picture you
see on your top left, the top
left, that's this one I've got

154
00:17:24,292 --> 00:17:31,792
here. That's made by a company
called 3‑D Robotics. It's called
The APM, and it's very, very

155
00:17:31,792 --> 00:17:39,000
popular these days. It's open
source hardware. You can kind of
modify it or make your own and

156
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,500
also all the software is open
source. You can go and download
the source code. If you wanted

157
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:48,333
to modify it, an important
lesson I learned is that I'm not
a good programmer. If I write

158
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:53,250
software on my laptop, try it
and see if it works, if it
crashes, nevermind let's try

159
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:57,875
again. You can't take those
risks with flying machines. You
can't just do some debugging at

160
00:17:57,875 --> 00:18:06,125
300 feet and see if it falls out
of the sky. That's not a clever
approach. The guy up on the side

161
00:18:06,125 --> 00:18:14,833
is ‑‑ I lost the pointer. On the
left is the APM from 3D Robotics
open source. The one in the

162
00:18:14,833 --> 00:18:22,667
middle here is an open pilot,
which is a very, very popular
project. I think it's also open

163
00:18:22,667 --> 00:18:28,417
source. You can put open pilot
software on other flight
controllers too. The green one

164
00:18:28,417 --> 00:18:34,542
is the KK board. It's a little
bit big I think. Very, very
popular. My favorite is the red

165
00:18:34,542 --> 00:18:41,167
one. It's called an Nausay E32,
it's an amazing project, a one
man job. It's a guy called Time

166
00:18:41,167 --> 00:18:46,417
Cop. It's one man who designed
the board, built it and sold
each one by himself and kind of

167
00:18:46,417 --> 00:18:53,917
shifts them. It's hard to get
ahold of them. I think ‑‑ yeah,
this one is close source also at

168
00:18:53,917 --> 00:19:00,833
the moment. The red one at the
bottom is I suspect one of you
guys may have heard of, it's

169
00:19:00,833 --> 00:19:07,833
called the Nasa by a company
called DJI. The phantom is the
one you see in the news. It's

170
00:19:07,833 --> 00:19:15,542
the white copter with red
stripes on it's arms. It's ‑‑
that's a flight controller that

171
00:19:15,542 --> 00:19:21,750
they use closed source
proprietary, kind of the windows
of this group of things here.

172
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:28,875
Other guys more Linux. We have
the same wars as OX wars. People
pick one of them and back them

173
00:19:28,875 --> 00:19:35,458
ignorantly saying this one is
the best. You guys don't know
what you are talking about.

174
00:19:35,458 --> 00:19:41,583
There are some issue was the
open source ones; that they do
seem to be fairly mature and

175
00:19:41,583 --> 00:19:46,458
they push features a bit more
than a reliable code. You have
thing called a fly‑away or

176
00:19:46,458 --> 00:19:58,875
fly-wayclub.com. Basically, If
one of this boards locks up and
typically the last pattern it

177
00:19:58,875 --> 00:20:05,125
has, it will go left forever,
which is horrible. As I know
from first experience now.

178
00:20:05,125 --> 00:20:09,500
Anyone ever had a fly‑away?
That's terrible. I'm sorry,
guys. I feel your pain. There's

179
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:16,125
at least five in the audience.
Go to fly awayclub.com and
register it. We have monthly

180
00:20:16,125 --> 00:20:26,125
meetings and talk about our
feelings about our drones that
left us. Okay. So, choosing the

181
00:20:26,125 --> 00:20:31,875
right Flight control is quite
important. Another nice aspect
of the APM here is you interface

182
00:20:31,875 --> 00:20:38,375
with it. It's got a set of G P I
opens. You can build your own
hardware that interfaces with it

183
00:20:38,375 --> 00:20:45,917
which is very useful for our
type scenario here. We will see
why in a little bit. Cameras,

184
00:20:45,917 --> 00:20:50,250
another very important
consideration. So my guy over
here, has a go pro camera mount

185
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:54,625
underneath for high definition
recording and then a small black
Sony camera, the one on the

186
00:20:54,625 --> 00:21:04,917
screen here.What you call a
first‑person view. Essentially
what that means is you have a

187
00:21:04,917 --> 00:21:10,458
live video feed from the machine
as it flys which is amazing. You
wear these goggles, the image ‑‑

188
00:21:10,458 --> 00:21:14,833
you can see on the bottom right
is the image you see through the
goggles. These things are

189
00:21:14,833 --> 00:21:20,375
awesome. A small camera on the
front so you can get a view from
the face so you can get

190
00:21:20,375 --> 00:21:24,958
orientation or avoid walking
into a tree. Very useful for
long‑range flights. It goes

191
00:21:24,958 --> 00:21:30,167
behind line of site. Very useful
to know where are you and where
are you going. Also, as you can

192
00:21:30,167 --> 00:21:37,208
see, it has an on‑screen
display. You got your compass
heading, You altitude, your S P,

193
00:21:37,208 --> 00:21:45,833
point of pointing towards home
if you get lost. Very, very
useful feature. Slightly more

194
00:21:45,833 --> 00:21:51,083
advanced cameras, these two ones
here, the golden eye, the red
one. Slightly more sophisticated

195
00:21:51,083 --> 00:21:59,000
camera, from the unit. This goes
on the fixed wing, the big one.
This gives a much better

196
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
resolution from a high altitude.
This camera you will use from
300 meters altitude. You will

197
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:10,417
see things this big on the
floor. It's expensive. The one
next to it is an infrared

198
00:22:10,417 --> 00:22:20,917
camera. Depending on the images
you want to create, you can have
it flying at night. You have a

199
00:22:20,917 --> 00:22:24,500
nice detailed camera, an
infrared camera. You combine
them together to get a nice lock

200
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:31,083
on your target. GPS, so as I
mentioned, the thing on the flag
at the top, that's a GPS used

201
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:37,417
for flight, so the device knows
where it is, and it's
actually ‑‑ I just push up, and

202
00:22:37,417 --> 00:22:43,083
it goes up. You can have a
hurricane blowing, I can keep
itself in that position. It

203
00:22:43,083 --> 00:22:48,500
keeps a lock on the GPS. A flag
controller to adjust the motor
to make sure it stays on the

204
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:55,042
target. You can also use the GPS
for setting flight paths, way
points. We will see some way

205
00:22:55,042 --> 00:23:01,042
points in a minute. You can set
the series of way points. The
other GPS device on the left,

206
00:23:01,042 --> 00:23:11,375
it's called the my Wi‑Fi, fly
it, use it, find it. A
self‑enclosed GPS device with an

207
00:23:11,375 --> 00:23:17,250
sim card. If I loose the thing
or if it flies away, you just
interact with that device. It

208
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:22,167
will send GPS coordinates. When
I lost mine, I did have this
devise but it was in my pocket.

209
00:23:22,167 --> 00:23:36,792
Not very useful. [Laughter]. >>
Hindsight is a very cruel thing.
So other considerations. The

210
00:23:36,792 --> 00:23:42,792
battery, the one I'm running
here, 500 thousand milliamp
hours, basically a recipe of

211
00:23:42,792 --> 00:23:54,292
power versus weight. You have a
bigger battery, it needs more
power to lift it. You put in

212
00:23:54,292 --> 00:23:59,042
your motor specifics, battery,
the optimal ‑‑ you have the
optimal battery to have.

213
00:23:59,042 --> 00:24:02,292
Essentially not great. It's
about 15 minutes of flight time.
If I spent a lot of money, It

214
00:24:02,292 --> 00:24:07,042
would maybe give me 45 minutes.
Low flight time compared to the
fixed wings, a few hours of life

215
00:24:07,042 --> 00:24:13,625
time. The ESC's:Electronic speed
controllers. Those control the
motors, and then actual motors

216
00:24:13,625 --> 00:24:22,792
and propellers, metrics, like
kind of how they spin, and the
metrics goes how much torque

217
00:24:22,792 --> 00:24:31,042
with how much lift? Do I lift
heavy stuff or go quickly? Here
the diagram illustrating the

218
00:24:31,042 --> 00:24:41,250
form factor practicality. The
one on the bottom left is the
phantom, which most enthusiast

219
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:46,750
have. THe media are terrified of
and very fancy. Those are toys.
Very low entry. This is not that

220
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:55,917
practical. You can't fly easily,
not much payload. Cameras aren't
fancy. Closed source. Flight

221
00:24:55,917 --> 00:25:03,708
controller can't expand. The one
over here, not a specific model.
It's the idea of APM's and open

222
00:25:03,708 --> 00:25:11,250
pilots and custom frames and
custom props and the ability to
expand and add to it. Then a

223
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:18,875
small fixed wing, a foam fixed
wing one here. A longer range,
maybe a bit more payload. And a

224
00:25:18,875 --> 00:25:25,333
penguin which is quite a big
craft. A nice payload,
long‑range, and really good

225
00:25:25,333 --> 00:25:32,083
surveillance. Some other
considerations, so ground
control, automations. How do you

226
00:25:32,083 --> 00:25:38,292
fly the thing? So the radio here
with this big Antenna which
makes TSA feel uncomfortable.

227
00:25:38,292 --> 00:25:47,833
Note to self, take it off next
time. This is a fairly standard
radio. I upgraded with this big

228
00:25:47,833 --> 00:25:53,542
transmitter. About 6 kilometers
range. Depending which country
your in, it might be illegal.

229
00:25:53,542 --> 00:26:06,917
You can scale it down 100
milliwats. With the goggles,
within or around 6 kilometers range. The

230
00:26:06,917 --> 00:26:13,625
device on top, that's automated
flight software. essentially,
from my tablet I can connect to

231
00:26:13,625 --> 00:26:20,542
the collar. I can see all kind
of metrics, what's the horizon?
What are the GPS Coordinates and

232
00:26:20,542 --> 00:26:25,292
my flight mode? You can say I
want you to fly here, here,
here, here at these altitudes

233
00:26:25,292 --> 00:26:33,750
and go. It will fly itself. It
can go far out of range from
your controller. That's useful

234
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:39,792
for our purposes. The most
interesting is devices like the
ones on the bottom left there.

235
00:26:39,792 --> 00:26:45,250
It's a very new product over
here from a company called drone
deploy. Essentially what they've

236
00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:50,792
created is a thing called a
copilot. When I mention this ATM
device the ability to plug in

237
00:26:50,792 --> 00:26:55,667
kind of external hardware to
control it and to interface with
it. They put this device here

238
00:26:55,667 --> 00:27:01,917
and co-pilot plugs into the
flight controller. It's got an
sim card and outbound data

239
00:27:01,917 --> 00:27:10,500
connection to a cloud service.
You log on to the drone deploy.
Your drone deploy account and

240
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:20,292
you can see all of your drones
on the web page wherever in the
world they are, because the

241
00:27:20,292 --> 00:27:23,417
copilot has an sim card with LTE
data. You can control a fleet of
these things from this lovely

242
00:27:23,417 --> 00:27:26,917
web interface and a nice way of
extraction from the device.
That's useful for us when you

243
00:27:26,917 --> 00:27:32,958
want to be identifying
individuals, tracking
individuals for long periods of

244
00:27:32,958 --> 00:27:39,042
time far beyond line of sight.
Here's an example of a Q ground
control, an open source

245
00:27:39,042 --> 00:27:44,750
software. They've got a few
packages you can download, open
source. You can build your own

246
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:50,042
ground control software to
control devices. Here set up a
flight plan to fly around the

247
00:27:50,042 --> 00:27:56,875
city. I didn't. It's illegal to
fly over private party. This is
drone deploy website. The

248
00:27:56,875 --> 00:28:07,958
website a mentioned. Check these
guys out. They are working on
cool tech. The ability to

249
00:28:07,958 --> 00:28:13,750
control lots and lots and lots
of these drone from a web
interface, from the cloud or

250
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:20,708
from your phone. Very powerful.
We have the flying machine. We
have the ability for it to fly

251
00:28:20,708 --> 00:28:25,250
either controlling it or
completely autonomous, long
range. We also have a drone

252
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:34,292
deploy kit that it can tell the
drone where to fly based on some
other information. So that's

253
00:28:34,292 --> 00:28:38,792
where the payload comes in. So
the payload is the actual
hacking kit on the machine. It

254
00:28:38,792 --> 00:28:44,958
will do the surveilling and
detection of people and breaking
into whatever infrastructure. It

255
00:28:44,958 --> 00:28:52,083
can also feed information to the
flight controller and say, hey,
I detect a strong signal in that

256
00:28:52,083 --> 00:28:59,542
direction. Let's fly that way
and drop water balloons on that
target over there. As you can

257
00:28:59,542 --> 00:29:04,333
probably guess, you may have
seen me speak before. I have
developed some software

258
00:29:04,333 --> 00:29:10,083
called,Snoopy. That is why
Snoopy is flying the plane
there. Snoopy software

259
00:29:10,083 --> 00:29:16,875
developing for the last couple
of years. All open source. To
describe it in a sentence,

260
00:29:16,875 --> 00:29:24,000
Snoopy is a distributed
tracking, pro-filing and data
inception frame work. It runs on

261
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:33,458
anything that runs Linux. So,
for example, I have got a beagle
bone here. I have an inline

262
00:29:33,458 --> 00:29:42,208
hundred cell phone which runs
Linux, amazing phones. And
essentially what it does, you

263
00:29:42,208 --> 00:29:48,250
have an array of these sensors.
You scatter them over some large
area. Attach some on the drone

264
00:29:48,250 --> 00:29:55,042
and some on the ground. It has a
series of plug ins that collect
various bits of data and send

265
00:29:55,042 --> 00:29:58,875
that data to a central server.
Giving interested in
surveillance and hacking, this

266
00:29:58,875 --> 00:30:08,167
thing has a Wi‑Fi adapter. If
you all have left your wifi on,
most of you may or may not know

267
00:30:08,167 --> 00:30:24,417
if you left your wifi on, your
phone constantly sending out
probe requests, which is looking

268
00:30:24,417 --> 00:30:29,083
for every network you ever
connected to. You are sitting in
an audience, your home is

269
00:30:29,083 --> 00:30:33,375
looking for home network back in
south Africa. Including that is
your map address so I can

270
00:30:33,375 --> 00:30:36,500
uniquely identify all you guys.
From the names of your networks,
I can figure out stuff about

271
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:40,708
you. If your phone is looking
for back of America corporate
Wi‑Fi, you probably work for

272
00:30:40,708 --> 00:30:44,458
Bank of America. Probably more
interesting is an amazing
website called wigle.net, W

273
00:30:44,458 --> 00:30:50,542
I‑G‑L‑E. It's a crowd source
database, born from DEF CON
about 12 years ago. I would love

274
00:30:50,542 --> 00:30:55,917
to meet them and buy them a
beer. You guys should contribute
to their project. It allows you

275
00:30:55,917 --> 00:31:04,333
to convert a network name, like
Verizon 12345 to GPS
coordinates. So, that's what I

276
00:31:04,333 --> 00:31:09,125
do with Snoopy. You guys left
your phone on, identify the
audience, figure out what

277
00:31:09,125 --> 00:31:12,958
networks your looking for and
figure out where you work, live
and travel. That is why I built

278
00:31:12,958 --> 00:31:19,125
the map at the beginning. Snoopy
is modular. Which means you can
add your own code and device.

279
00:31:19,125 --> 00:31:25,292
For the moment, I have support
Wi‑Fi, bluetooth, working on GSM
and Ibeacon. What Snoopy looks

280
00:31:25,292 --> 00:31:33,833
for and track and surveil people
is based on what we coined as
the digital terrestrial

281
00:31:33,833 --> 00:31:41,167
footprints. Each person that
carries a bunch of devices on
them. So, got your smart phone,

282
00:31:41,167 --> 00:31:49,167
fitness brace let, google
goggles, pace maker with Wi‑Fi.
Who thought of that idea? Your

283
00:31:49,167 --> 00:31:55,958
NFC bank cards and your RFI ID
tags and your passports. In the
states, essentially you all

284
00:31:55,958 --> 00:32:01,542
carry this tech on you. If they
mimic any kind of wireless
signals, that's the kind of

285
00:32:01,542 --> 00:32:05,792
stuff I'm interested in. I want
to detect that stuff. Some of it
is easy and obvious. Like Wi‑Fi

286
00:32:05,792 --> 00:32:14,250
is unencrypted. Other stuff is
harder. So, anything cellular.
GSM is tricky but here some

287
00:32:14,250 --> 00:32:24,208
stuff, pre- authentication, can
uniquely identify you. Things
like bluetooth, not too hard to

288
00:32:24,208 --> 00:32:31,792
detect, and also NFCRFID I need
to be in fairly close range.
Flying unit not useful. You can

289
00:32:31,792 --> 00:32:39,625
Supplement the flying unit with
ground‑based unit, detect and
the Wi‑Fi, you would have from

290
00:32:39,625 --> 00:32:50,125
the flying vehicle. 200 feet you
can't hear it or see it, but it
can hear you and see you. As I

291
00:32:50,125 --> 00:32:57,458
mentioned, Snoopy is a
distributive frame work. There
are lots of devices. They all

292
00:32:57,458 --> 00:33:05,292
synchronize the data and and
send back to one server for
exploration. You can have your 5

293
00:33:05,292 --> 00:33:10,208
Flying units in the field. A
whole bunch deployed in train
stations and shops. As you guys

294
00:33:10,208 --> 00:33:15,417
walk around emitting your
digital address and footprint,
we can suck that stuff up and

295
00:33:15,417 --> 00:33:22,375
synchronize it and watch you as
you move around. What's
interesting is even if your

296
00:33:22,375 --> 00:33:26,458
devices are individually
non-identifiable because of
crypto or whatever. Sometimes

297
00:33:26,458 --> 00:33:29,333
just based on the collection of
those devices, you might have a
unique collection of signatures

298
00:33:29,333 --> 00:33:43,625
although can't individually
identify them. Kind of a cloud
of devices that can use uniquely

299
00:33:43,625 --> 00:33:47,792
identify you. This is what
Snoopy looks like. Running it on
an Linux box here. With runs,

300
00:33:47,792 --> 00:33:53,667
Specify the I flag and get all
the plug ins. You have
interesting stuff. Bluetooth,

301
00:33:53,667 --> 00:33:59,625
Wi‑Fi. On the Wi‑Fi side, have
you heard of fire sheep? F I
sheep? That's kind of fun. FI

302
00:33:59,625 --> 00:34:07,875
land, essentially with a Wi‑Fi
plug in, and passwords and that
kind of thing. Grab WP

303
00:34:07,875 --> 00:34:26,292
handshakes for later or flying
tracking. Some data
synchronization between servers.

304
00:34:26,292 --> 00:34:29,792
Rouge access point. Your phone
looking for starbucks. My device
will respond and say I'm

305
00:34:29,792 --> 00:34:33,875
Starbucks. It will connect. You
will get to facebook and steel
all your data. What else?

306
00:34:33,875 --> 00:34:39,708
Wi‑Fi...Man in the middle stuff.
Wiggle, the website a mentioned.
Look at networks your looking at

307
00:34:39,708 --> 00:34:46,833
and turn them into GPS
coordinates and google street
photographs. And as I said, it's

308
00:34:46,833 --> 00:34:53,042
modular, you guys come along and
contribute to the moment and
fiddling with GSM, iBeacon, SDR

309
00:34:53,042 --> 00:35:01,542
and other bits and pieces, other
ideas, so open CV, image
detection, currently able to

310
00:35:01,542 --> 00:35:08,083
look at camera and detect spaces
and encoded that with the
identification of unique mac

311
00:35:08,083 --> 00:35:15,083
address. If you have enough
overlap, a corridor and you walk
through this corridor a few

312
00:35:15,083 --> 00:35:19,458
times a day, each time I extract
your face, and with a few mac
addresses, given observation, I

313
00:35:19,458 --> 00:35:28,167
will address one mac address
correlated to one face. Cool.
What is methodology? We have

314
00:35:28,167 --> 00:35:35,250
vehicle. We have autonomy with
something like the drone deploy
or similar devices. Q A ground

315
00:35:35,250 --> 00:35:43,208
control which is all open
source. We have a payload which
is an Snoopy hacking software,

316
00:35:43,208 --> 00:35:50,292
and we have ground control on
the bottom there. So let's think
about a few use cases. The one

317
00:35:50,292 --> 00:35:58,000
idea I have is that if you want
to find an existing person of
interest, so all kinds of

318
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:05,958
scenarios, say that someone is
arrested and you check the mac
address of their cell phone. It

319
00:36:05,958 --> 00:36:09,958
will look for that data. After a
celebrity, attend multiple
events that we know they're

320
00:36:09,958 --> 00:36:14,250
attending and looking for
overlap of one unique signature
from all events to identify that

321
00:36:14,250 --> 00:36:21,625
person, however we get it, we
can use the flying machine and
say, go on a search pattern and

322
00:36:21,625 --> 00:36:28,542
take this spiral route. Keep
doing this until you detect the
pattern that we're interested

323
00:36:28,542 --> 00:36:34,500
in. Simple case just a mac
address. Hover, drop water
balloons,return to base, take a

324
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:43,333
photograph or whatever you like.
So in term of usefulness of
putting the stuff on a flying

325
00:36:43,333 --> 00:36:53,792
machine, by bypassing physical
barriers. If big walls, men with
guns, dogs, or you can't get

326
00:36:53,792 --> 00:36:59,833
look for something. With a
device like this we can bypass
physical restrictions and pass

327
00:36:59,833 --> 00:37:08,250
past detection or over borders
or jurisdiction we are not
allowed to be and it can be

328
00:37:08,250 --> 00:37:16,167
useful perhaps. Another use
case, say, for example, downtown
Las Vegas is a riot breaking out

329
00:37:16,167 --> 00:37:22,250
because ‑‑ I don't know why
people would riot in Vegas ‑‑ on
booze or something. [Laughter].

330
00:37:22,250 --> 00:37:26,583
>> Big riot breaks out, and I
could launch this device from
just outside and autonomous fly

331
00:37:26,583 --> 00:37:35,292
it. Camera pointing down, and
identify all the persons down
below. For future prosecution or

332
00:37:35,292 --> 00:37:44,542
interrogation. You can identify
them and potentially figure out
where they live, work and who

333
00:37:44,542 --> 00:37:49,750
they are. Of course with all
these kinds of things they're
horrible things that can be

334
00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:54,375
done. In an oppressive regime, a
peaceful protect and the
government use the same tech to

335
00:37:54,375 --> 00:38:04,750
hover over the peaceful and for
prosecution. It goes both ways.
Full discussion here, another

336
00:38:04,750 --> 00:38:15,000
useful idea is if you want to
scour and fly a city. If you
want to fly over the whole of

337
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:18,667
Las Vegas, trivial to put in a
grid pattern, because GPS
device, you have correlation

338
00:38:18,667 --> 00:38:24,000
between the position and down
below. Kind of like the wiggle
database, like we're driving by

339
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:31,542
flying devices. Identify people
down below much faster than a
ground‑based unit. A term that I

340
00:38:31,542 --> 00:38:40,420
like to coin, the authentication
bombs. So we can fly over an
area and drop the authentication

341
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:47,700
bombs. What that means is just
emitting deauthentication
packets which will force devices

342
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:54,120
to disassociate from their
wireless networks. They
reassociate and capture double

343
00:38:54,120 --> 00:39:01,620
handshake for later cracking.
You can scour, go on a grid
pattern and tie a city, dropping

344
00:39:01,625 --> 00:39:06,833
these bomb, grabbing all the WP
handshakes, sink the data in
real time back to servers, we

345
00:39:06,833 --> 00:39:14,875
crack them as we go along. So
all of that is already In Snoopy
so you can download it. You can

346
00:39:14,875 --> 00:39:20,792
load that at the conference
today but you shouldn't.
[Chuckles]. >> But it's there.

347
00:39:20,792 --> 00:39:28,125
I've got a quick video to show
you, a demonstration. Let's see
if it works. Because the demo

348
00:39:28,125 --> 00:39:44,417
Gods were cruel when I was
setting up and you couldn't see
my screen at first. And you

349
00:39:44,417 --> 00:39:51,417
can't see that. Maybe if I drag
it over here or over here. Okay.
So this is a video demonstration

350
00:39:51,417 --> 00:40:04,875
of some Snoopy data I'v
collected. This is the interface
you browse from data collect

351
00:40:04,875 --> 00:40:10,458
from the drone and from ground
base unit, called Montego, a
visualization tool. The scenario

352
00:40:10,458 --> 00:40:14,667
is that somebody's landed at
Heathrow airport and a person of
interest. You don't know what

353
00:40:14,667 --> 00:40:19,542
time they landed or what time
but we know they landed there.
We also, and we have a Snoopy at

354
00:40:19,542 --> 00:40:23,792
Heathrow at local airport,
coffee shops and units flying
over parks. London, Hyde park.

355
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:33,583
I'm going to run a machine which
a series of transforms which
will look at all those 10 drones

356
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:42,160
in the field running now. It's
looks for one device that is at
Heathrow at one of those hotels

357
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:51,200
went observed in one of the
parks and identifies just one
device there, and that's ‑‑ not

358
00:40:51,200 --> 00:41:00,880
full screen ‑‑ it identifies
this one device, Marsha's
iPhone. The name of the phone by

359
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:05,660
passively intercepting her
communication. She's on an open
network, passive. All this

360
00:41:05,667 --> 00:41:16,958
information to identify the name
of her phone, which turns out to
be her name. We see her phone is

361
00:41:16,958 --> 00:41:25,333
probing for those seven network
Tls. We G locate those networks
through the wiggle database, and

362
00:41:25,333 --> 00:41:38,125
we notice that ET home network
looking for there, locates just
one address. So we have a very

363
00:41:38,125 --> 00:41:42,792
good chance of knowing where she
lives now, and there's a Google
street view, photograph of her

364
00:41:42,792 --> 00:41:48,542
house. And what we can also do,
let's just get rid of those, and
what we're going to do, now I'm

365
00:41:48,542 --> 00:41:53,042
going to look, are there any
other devices, people looking
for any other network that

366
00:41:53,042 --> 00:41:59,875
Marsha is looking for. That will
reveal people she is traveling
with, friend or families or

367
00:41:59,875 --> 00:42:04,292
colleagues. We notice a whole
bunch of other people looking
for the same network, the same

368
00:42:04,292 --> 00:42:09,958
network she's been looking for.
The stuff like Starbucks not
interesting. Stuff like a BT

369
00:42:09,958 --> 00:42:23,833
home hub, that's probably a
second device of her or her
partner or somebody. On the side

370
00:42:23,833 --> 00:42:27,375
there, RBS, that seems like a
work address. World bank of
Scotland. It looks like she is

371
00:42:27,375 --> 00:42:31,917
traveling with work colleagues.
Do the process and identify her
work colleagues, geo locate them

372
00:42:31,917 --> 00:42:35,125
and try to intercept any of
their data and get their
identity and see what they're up

373
00:42:35,125 --> 00:42:44,958
to. Let's skip forward a bit. So
now, from the passive data
inception, few minutes, also

374
00:42:44,958 --> 00:42:51,583
having a look at what website
she's been visiting, what
cookies from those websites, so

375
00:42:51,583 --> 00:43:07,833
she's logged into various like
Yahoos, cookies, and my
favorite. Running SSL strip or

376
00:43:07,833 --> 00:43:11,958
printing in the background, SSL
strip is a way to trick your
browser in to not using SSL into

377
00:43:11,958 --> 00:43:19,375
a bunch of websites she was
using. A lot of this stuff isn't
new. What is new is bringing

378
00:43:19,375 --> 00:43:28,792
that tech together. Bring it
together in a nice visual
framework and one which you can

379
00:43:28,792 --> 00:43:38,583
use lots and lots of data very
easily and quickly. Snoopy has
some friends. This kind of data

380
00:43:38,583 --> 00:43:48,000
inception is actively done in
retail. When you go to shopping
mail, military, they sell

381
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:52,625
packages. Snoopy is open source
and free. I have 5 minutes left.
I don't want you guys to think

382
00:43:52,625 --> 00:44:00,292
that drones are bad and evil and
banned them. They have good
functions. I am a hacker. There

383
00:44:00,292 --> 00:44:10,625
is far more good. That's a
drone. I think somewhere in the
Middle East, if someone is

384
00:44:10,625 --> 00:44:20,750
drowning, fly off drop them,
agriculture, inspecting pipe
lines, providing Internet. Very

385
00:44:20,750 --> 00:44:25,917
briefly we are starting a site
launch. We are starting a
commercial service around this.

386
00:44:25,917 --> 00:44:32,375
It's called shadow Darklyfor
sight launch. Essentially you
can build your own drone or buy

387
00:44:32,375 --> 00:44:40,083
from us. Just a sensor device
and essentially Synchronize to
our serve. There is a free

388
00:44:40,083 --> 00:44:44,625
option or paid for option, first
time I ever tried to
commercialize something. I hope

389
00:44:44,625 --> 00:44:54,060
it goes well. I will give away
one Snoopy sensor for one
audience member. I want you guys

390
00:44:54,060 --> 00:44:59,960
to tweet this hashtag. I will
write a program to pick one at
random this evening. Whoever

391
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:08,900
picks, I will post an Snoopy
sensor device. Set up ready to
go so you can surveil, track,

392
00:45:08,900 --> 00:45:16,020
intercept and all of that.
Here's a paper I have written,
digital tracking, the future of

393
00:45:16,027 --> 00:45:22,580
surveillance. I think it should
be on your C D's, and this
evening I will put it on sense

394
00:45:22,583 --> 00:45:28,875
log two. Final point colleagues
are giving a talk tomorrow at
4:00 titled: Mana from heaven:

395
00:45:28,875 --> 00:45:34,175
Improving rogue A P attacks. And
that's all. Thank you very much.
(Applause)
