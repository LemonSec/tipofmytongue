1
00:00:35,208 --> 00:00:39,750
[ Laughter ] Good morning. I'm
weaponizing your pets. Let's get
started. I'm Gene Bransfield and

2
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:47,542
a principle engineer. If you
spend enough time at me, I love
my job. It is a fantastic thing

3
00:00:47,542 --> 00:00:53,542
to awake in the morning and go
to work and get paid to do cool
stuff. People want my job. The

4
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,083
joke is on them. They cannot
have my job. I'm going to be the
guy who dies on a  Friday of a 

5
00:01:01,083 --> 00:01:07,458
long weekend. I'm in the corner.
And they clean me up, don't step
on the stain, that is the Gene

6
00:01:07,458 --> 00:01:13,458
Bransfield stain in the carpet.
This is a story about triumphs
and woes and lessons learns. So

7
00:01:17,667 --> 00:01:23,667
weaponize  ‑ ‑ weapons your
pets. 15% of the world's
Internet traffic is dedicated to

8
00:01:27,958 --> 00:01:33,958
cats. We have the whole world at
our fingertips and watch cats  ‑
‑ on‑ line, I find most of these

9
00:01:40,292 --> 00:01:46,292
things boring. So I started
including pictures of cats and
stories around pets. In fact,

10
00:01:48,917 --> 00:01:54,917
this is the picture that started
it all. Oh, that is awesome and
you know it. So I just finished

11
00:02:03,958 --> 00:02:07,500
one such presentation, somebody
came up to me and said I'm going
to give you my cat collar, a 

12
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:14,208
GPS chip in it, and it would
tell you where the cat was and
send you back GPS coordinates.

13
00:02:14,208 --> 00:02:20,792
Now, I need a  Wi‑ Fi sniffer
and have a  war. And a  service
dog. A  lady walked in with a

14
00:02:20,792 --> 00:02:26,792
saddlebags and said, denying of
service dog. I said, cool, is
there a  pineapple. No. He jumps

15
00:02:31,875 --> 00:02:37,875
in your lap and you can't to it.
The pineapple is a great idea.
Working animals are nothing do.

16
00:02:42,917 --> 00:02:50,667
Military and dogs and bad ass
dogs that jump out of military
aircrafts into the water. And

17
00:02:50,667 --> 00:02:56,667
then gas mask dogs, the guy is
wearing a gas mask, the dog is,
too. This guy jumped of the

18
00:02:59,167 --> 00:03:05,167
aircraft at 30,000  feet. That
is a bad ass dog. And then we
have a  real seal. This is the

19
00:03:09,208 --> 00:03:13,750
truth. The navy uses marine
animals for defense, and finding
mines. If you think you are

20
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:21,250
stealthy and you're going to
blow up the harbor and flipper
sniffs out the gopher hole. Back

21
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:27,250
in the '60's there was a lot of
pot going around the CIA.
Imagine sitting around the table

22
00:03:30,667 --> 00:03:36,667
saying we're going to take a 
cat, and put a  transmitter in
its chest, and a microphone in

23
00:03:40,083 --> 00:03:46,417
his ear and  called it acoustic
kitty. This actually got funded.
I'm not kidding here. Science

24
00:03:46,417 --> 00:03:52,417
and experiment, they brought it
out for the test, put the cat
down, and listened to those guys

25
00:03:54,500 --> 00:04:02,083
and the cat ran out in traffic.
That was the end of the acoustic
kitty. At that point they

26
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:06,375
defunded this, not because it
was a  bad idea. All of the
scientists quit. Screw this,

27
00:04:06,375 --> 00:04:13,250
cats are hard to work with. This
is interesting. So put a  collar
or harness on a  cat, rule

28
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:19,250
number one I don't want to harm
a  cat, I don't like cats. Rule
number one, the cat should be

29
00:04:24,083 --> 00:04:32,042
able to wear stuff comfortably
and not any harmed. Form, fi,
and function, we don't want

30
00:04:32,042 --> 00:04:38,042
blinking lights, and then, blue
light and it is a  cat. Wave
point and the Wi‑ Fi sniffer

31
00:04:40,875 --> 00:04:47,208
will bring back the stuff and
other products out here to deal
with your stuff. This camera

32
00:04:47,208 --> 00:04:54,250
that hangs on the collar, none
of the solutions do Wi‑ Fi
sniffing. I'm good there. I

33
00:04:54,250 --> 00:05:02,125
thought about ways to do this.
This is a computer on a  stick
by kind of expensive. Cotton

34
00:05:02,125 --> 00:05:07,042
candy, computing a  stick. Cool
solution. The rock chip 3066.
You can attack to the back of

35
00:05:07,042 --> 00:05:13,042
your television, and there is an
image you can put on this thing.
I was having trouble doing that.

36
00:05:15,083 --> 00:05:21,083
I sat sown and had a beer and
thought about it, it is small,
GPS, Wi‑ Fi and cellular. Any

37
00:05:24,208 --> 00:05:32,083
can idea what that can possibly
be? How about a  phone? It was
in my pocket the entire time.

38
00:05:32,083 --> 00:05:37,000
Good. I can make it. No, they
thought of that. You can
download this is from the

39
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:43,000
android store and you can do
volunteer war touching anywhere.
Now, we need a  volunteer cat,

40
00:05:49,292 --> 00:05:53,667
this is Skitzy. This belongs to
my friend Reeves. It's 22 inches
from base of neck to tip of

41
00:05:53,667 --> 00:05:59,708
tail, 20 inches around the chest
and 12 inches around the neck.
This is a big damn cat. So I'm

42
00:05:59,708 --> 00:06:03,167
not worried about putting crazy
things on him and his friends
making fun of him, he'll just

43
00:06:03,167 --> 00:06:09,167
smack them around a little bit.
So now we need a  cat coat to
hold it, and if you Google cat

44
00:06:11,333 --> 00:06:15,125
coat on the Internet, you get
pictures of girls wearing coats
with cats on it. And if you

45
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:21,125
Google kitty coat you get other
things. So I got a  cat with a
dog coat in a small enough form

46
00:06:25,083 --> 00:06:30,000
factor. So that's what I did. So
now the plan is tech in the cat,
coat on the cat, send the cat on

47
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,333
a walkabout and recover data
when the cat returns. And then
profit. So step one, put the

48
00:06:34,333 --> 00:06:40,333
chip in the coat. Step two, put
the coat on the cat. You can see
he's thrilled. Send the cat on

49
00:06:44,167 --> 00:06:50,167
the walk about and profit,
right? No. That's the backyard.
[ Laughter ] So what could have

50
00:06:54,208 --> 00:07:01,750
possibly gone wrong here. It is
obvious we didn't put it on
tight enough. So the chip in the

51
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:08,792
coat, and the coat on the cat,
and send him on a walk about and
we wait. It is 18 hours later

52
00:07:08,792 --> 00:07:16,458
people are freaking out. We are
at the backdoor and hear a meow,
this is the cat. And the form

53
00:07:16,458 --> 00:07:22,458
factor of the cat going out the
door and coming back in. So we
failed on that, the last known

54
00:07:24,458 --> 00:07:30,458
GPS location of it is right
here. We went there and it is
not there. So, so far we learned

55
00:07:32,708 --> 00:07:38,208
that cats are really hard to
work with. You should always
test your expensive stuff out

56
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:42,708
before sending it out on a cat
someplace. I'm again to need an
Amazon prime account. They were

57
00:07:42,708 --> 00:07:48,458
worried about the cat, no more
coat. I was talking to my
friend, Bill, about this, he

58
00:07:48,458 --> 00:07:55,292
laughed and said why don't you
try a  small power and
consumption, and there are chips

59
00:07:55,292 --> 00:08:02,375
and solutions out there. My
first question is what is
Arduino? A  project with a

60
00:08:02,375 --> 00:08:09,458
researcher in Italy, like his
master's thesis. There is open
source software out there, and

61
00:08:09,458 --> 00:08:15,292
why not open source hardware. It
is cool. Comes in a  chip set,
you can stack them on it, and

62
00:08:15,292 --> 00:08:22,500
make robot, and remote control
car. This guy used it to check
the food in his freezer. This

63
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:28,292
guy used it to make the robot's
hand move, and this guy used to
cheat on his video games.

64
00:08:28,292 --> 00:08:34,958
Relatively small form factor.
The good news with Arduino is
Open Source and inexpensive,

65
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:39,583
until the cat starts loosing
them and you have to buy nine of
them. Bad news, poorly

66
00:08:39,583 --> 00:08:43,792
documented it can take forever
to get to you, an expansion
shield, sometimes okay. Cool,

67
00:08:43,792 --> 00:08:49,792
that's great. But I have never
done doing, and worked with
small chips. I'm not a

68
00:08:51,958 --> 00:08:57,958
professional coder and I have
never  soldered before. It is
solder. Like what. He said,

69
00:09:00,292 --> 00:09:06,958
don't worry, it's easy. The plan
is to get some Arduino the
stuff, sign on the form factor,

70
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:11,875
put it together on a  collar and
figure out something for the
denial service dog. So I went

71
00:09:11,875 --> 00:09:17,542
out and bought the how to book.
There was guides and learning
and reading up on it with

72
00:09:17,542 --> 00:09:23,708
electronics stuff. So I get the
flashy stuff flashing and the
non flashy things flashing when

73
00:09:23,708 --> 00:09:28,625
they're not suppose to flash. So
I said I'm ready to go, need the
more advance stuff. Libraries

74
00:09:28,625 --> 00:09:34,625
for Wi‑ Fi, they got it, GPS,
they got it. SD card stuff, they
got it. So, Jeremyblum.com, this

75
00:09:34,625 --> 00:09:40,625
has a lot of videos on making
these things work. I used him
religiously. Thank God. I did

76
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:48,042
all of my research and
background investigation, I'm
now an expert. I went out and

77
00:09:48,042 --> 00:09:54,042
got a  Wi‑ Fi and a GPS child.
So my plan is to get the Wi‑ Fi
stuff and writing to an SD card

78
00:09:56,333 --> 00:10:02,875
and GPS writing to an SD card,
combine the two and then profit.
The Wi‑ Fi shield was cool.

79
00:10:02,875 --> 00:10:08,417
Setup, the drivers worked away.
And hooked it up and was even
mentioned on the Arduino

80
00:10:08,417 --> 00:10:13,958
website, the parameters and
variables. Got my solution. That
was easy. GPS not so much easy.

81
00:10:13,958 --> 00:10:19,375
A little bit about GPS, the NMEA
string is what the satellites
are broadcasting up there,

82
00:10:19,375 --> 00:10:25,042
national maritime electronic
association. This comma
separated value there is what

83
00:10:25,042 --> 00:10:32,042
the satellite is actually
sending out and the job of the
receive take it in and transmit

84
00:10:32,042 --> 00:10:37,708
to (?) So  the GPS boot process
is starts up and it doesn't know
where it is on the planet. Could

85
00:10:37,708 --> 00:10:43,208
be in your back pocket on
Timbuktu. It has to listen to
space. So the GPS process was

86
00:10:43,208 --> 00:10:48,417
fairly poorly documented. Get at
least satellites to listen to
and figure out where it is, this

87
00:10:48,417 --> 00:10:53,625
process can take two to 15
minutes. And if someone is
looking over your shoulder it is

88
00:10:53,625 --> 00:10:58,833
going to take 15 minutes. The
GPS shield was rather poorly
documented. There was no docs in

89
00:10:58,833 --> 00:11:04,542
the kit. It took my several
weeks of what is wrong with
this, why is it not working.

90
00:11:04,542 --> 00:11:11,000
Finally at the long end of the
research effort the baud rate is
supposed to be 34,800. I wanted

91
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:16,250
to give demonstration is how it
is poorly documented. Now I go
on line and cannot find the it

92
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:20,667
is 34800. The GPS shield is off
to the side. Because I was going
to use the pins. I put this

93
00:11:20,667 --> 00:11:26,667
together and combined the code
and got this weird error about
80% memory utilization. I see

94
00:11:36,583 --> 00:11:43,875
that on windows blow it off and
go for it. They were telling me
the truth. 80%, the chip cannot

95
00:11:43,875 --> 00:11:50,708
work. 32K on the memory. The
Arduino mega, however, has 256K.
And I purchased the mega. Put

96
00:11:50,708 --> 00:11:56,917
that together, messed around
with variables, messed around
with some stuff and Woo Hoo it

97
00:11:56,917 --> 00:12:02,917
works. A  working prototype. So
the Arduino 2550, more better mo
betta, mo ports. But the size is

98
00:12:05,875 --> 00:12:11,875
not mo better. So I searched all
over the internet tried to find
something that is ting 2560 from

99
00:12:17,292 --> 00:12:24,792
JK Devices.com. It is a  ripoff,
I was going to mention it during
my talk. Defcon knows about

100
00:12:24,792 --> 00:12:30,792
that. I didn't know about that
at a time, I need a  Wi‑ Fi
chip, you can see the breakout

101
00:12:34,542 --> 00:12:40,375
board chip there, this is the
spark cord, I call it the
mullet, because Wi‑ Fi in the

102
00:12:40,375 --> 00:12:47,917
front and, Arduino in the back.
And of course a  GPS chip, and
a  SD card breakout board. So

103
00:12:47,917 --> 00:12:53,917
the mega worked but the mega
mini was four weeks to ship and
another solutions are too big in

104
00:12:58,667 --> 00:13:05,792
size and too small in memory. So
I went with the spark core that
had troubled shipping. So I

105
00:13:05,792 --> 00:13:12,208
borrowed one from Bill, who got
me started on this. It is a  32
bit, 128K of memory, SPI, and

106
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:18,208
12D those are like the protocol
chips kind of like the Internet
and had that, a TICC3 Wi‑ Fi

107
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:29,000
chip. It is it compatible? No.
People that are a  chip head
will say yes. If you say it is

108
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:37,458
Ardiomo compatible , it mean it
will work with my external
component an I can just cut and

109
00:13:37,458 --> 00:13:43,333
past the code, from one to
another and and that's how it
works. So this is one thing, the

110
00:13:43,333 --> 00:13:47,375
spark cord is another. I will
have to start over again from
scratch. That made me not happy.

111
00:13:51,958 --> 00:13:56,000
Despite this problem, the spark
was very, very cool. A 
dedicated core group of

112
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,917
developers I would looking at
the code, and one developer
would say I would like to do

113
00:13:59,917 --> 00:14:05,458
blah, and then they would stay
up all night and blah, I figured
this stuff is getting updated. A

114
00:14:05,458 --> 00:14:10,167
shout out to peekay123 who
helped me a lot on my project! I
figured all this stuff is

115
00:14:10,167 --> 00:14:15,000
getting updated so let's see
what happens. Libraries, someone
posted SD libraries at the

116
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:21,292
forums they compiled. Good
morning, libraries, they
combined and worked with my GPS

117
00:14:21,292 --> 00:14:27,875
shield. Wi‑ Fi libraries not so
much. The spark cord bills
itself as an Internet of things

118
00:14:27,875 --> 00:14:31,667
device. I'm going to say that a
couple of times because it
screwed me a  couple of times.

119
00:14:31,667 --> 00:14:36,708
So the Wi‑ Fi is in the
background as a service, you are
coding up front and just connect

120
00:14:36,708 --> 00:14:42,792
you to the Internet. Not there
to mess with, but I want to mess
with it. The Adafruit board that

121
00:14:42,792 --> 00:14:49,417
I bought the exact same chip. It
and it is available library for
download. And I messed with it

122
00:14:49,417 --> 00:14:56,250
before. Thomas Edison said I
found 100 ways not to make the
lightbulb, before making the

123
00:14:56,250 --> 00:15:02,250
lightbulb. I found a lot of ways
to make a  kitty collar. I
messed with these things and had

124
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:12,042
some SSID scanning stuff and
copied and pasted it and put it
in there, bam, it worked. Yes.

125
00:15:12,042 --> 00:15:19,708
Now, I have the good morning,
working on the spark. The SD
compiled on the spark. SSID is

126
00:15:19,708 --> 00:15:26,542
working. Now working with the
tiny components that I bout and
that means soldering. Who looks

127
00:15:26,542 --> 00:15:31,500
to solder and likes it?
Soldering is my new least
favorite activity. So for those

128
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:37,500
getting ready to learn how to
solder have rules. Rule number
one, don't touch the pointy end.

129
00:15:40,708 --> 00:15:47,625
That's where the hotness is.
Rule number two is remembering
where you put the soldering iron

130
00:15:47,625 --> 00:15:53,625
down. If you violate rule number
two, you're going to violate
rule number one. Rule number

131
00:15:56,667 --> 00:16:03,083
three is everything looks so
easy on the Internet and it's
not. So that not withstanding my

132
00:16:03,083 --> 00:16:09,750
first attempt went well. I put
the SD breakout board here, this
is my breadboard stuff, the chip

133
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:15,042
on the left side. There's a
core, breakout board, had to
solder ends onto the end for and

134
00:16:15,042 --> 00:16:22,750
the GPS antenna. That went
pretty good. I'm home testing
everything went great. And

135
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:27,250
getting sniffing, doing stuff, I
put it in my yard, the
neighbor's Wi‑ Fi, and I took it

136
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:33,250
on a  car ride, and there was
massive failure, nothing. Why
not? Well, again, the spark is

137
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:37,792
an Internet of things device, it
is never meant not to be
connected the Internet. So I was

138
00:16:37,792 --> 00:16:41,750
talking to the guys on the
forums and they said turn the
chip on and off because it will

139
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:48,458
suck power. But when you turn it
on put the code put it in the
status equals Wi‑ Fi on. It is

140
00:16:48,458 --> 00:16:54,458
true if there is a known access
point. If I'm a  half mile down
the road that will not happen. I

141
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:06,667
could turn on the chip and do my
scan before it made a 
connection. That worked

142
00:17:06,667 --> 00:17:12,375
perfectly. I removed the code
from the stuff. That is all that
I needed. I'm back on track. So

143
00:17:12,375 --> 00:17:19,000
I took it for a  drive and got
data back. And so I was popping
the into Google Earth. I was

144
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:23,417
driving on the highway, they had
me off in a lake and I was
sitting in my house was I

145
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:28,750
halfway down the block. So I was
wondering what was going on. So
who posted the GPS library, they

146
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:36,583
did the NMEA conversion
incorrectly. So now I have no
GPS libraries. So when I was

147
00:17:36,583 --> 00:17:41,333
working on the Aduino stuff, I
had the GPS plus‑ plus  ‑ ‑
stuff that I loved to use, so

148
00:17:41,333 --> 00:17:47,292
easy to interact with. And it
had everything that I needed. So
I needed to find someone to put

149
00:17:47,292 --> 00:17:54,292
the GPS plus plus into the spark
and I talked to Bill and said he
port libraries. I said how do

150
00:17:54,292 --> 00:18:00,875
you port libraries. He explained
it to me like my rocket science
story, having drinks in a  bar

151
00:18:00,875 --> 00:18:03,833
and somebody and he is a cool
guy. What do you do for a 
living? I'm a  rocket scientist.

152
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:07,083
Seriously. No, seriously, I'm a 
rocket scientist. That is cool,
what do you think about the

153
00:18:07,083 --> 00:18:11,750
phrase, it's not rocket science.
I laugh at that, there are
science and engineering to

154
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:17,750
building the rocket and fuel in
them, but you put the rocket on
the launch pad and hit the red

155
00:18:23,333 --> 00:18:29,333
button and hope for the best.
Sometimes it blows up. Sometimes
it tips over and blows up.

156
00:18:33,167 --> 00:18:39,833
Sometimes it gets to space and
blows up. The hard part is not
getting new rockets, the hard

157
00:18:39,833 --> 00:18:45,833
part is getting more monkeys to
put in the rocket. That is a 
rocket science joke. That's how

158
00:18:48,458 --> 00:18:55,292
you port libraries. We changed
our Arduino stuff out with the
spark stuff, hit compile, listen

159
00:18:55,292 --> 00:18:59,000
to it scream at you and fix what
it is screaming about. You keep
doing that until it doesn't

160
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,500
scream anymore. If you compiling
is screening at you, and you
scream back, you succeed at

161
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:09,500
scaring your wife. I did that
for a  couple of hours and BAM,
it works. I ported libraries. I

162
00:19:11,708 --> 00:19:17,708
was so proud of myself I posted
them to github. The next problem
is then power consumption, my

163
00:19:21,083 --> 00:19:26,333
buddy Ricky Hill hooked me up
with the batteries for model
airline stuff. 3.7‑ volts,

164
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:31,542
500mAh batteries - enough to get
a kiddy thing going. So now I'm
testing for the optimal power

165
00:19:31,542 --> 00:19:37,000
consumption. The first thing you
think of is I will turn
everything on, get the stuff,

166
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:41,917
and turn everything off.
Remember, before I told you it
can take 2 to 15 minutes to get

167
00:19:41,917 --> 00:19:46,875
the GPS lock. If you turn it off
the GPS, you lose the satellite,
and you the cat runs into bush

168
00:19:46,875 --> 00:19:53,292
you burn through without getting
any data. So the best thing for
me, you turn the main micro

169
00:19:53,292 --> 00:19:58,625
controller on and keep the GPS
powered and that worked much,
much better. Much better,

170
00:19:58,625 --> 00:20:03,583
collections every 30 seconds
lasted 4 hours, collections
every 10 minutes lasted 8 hours.

171
00:20:03,583 --> 00:20:10,750
So now I have to make a  collar.
If you thought soldering is fun.
Desoldering is twice as much fun

172
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:16,292
as soldering. Oh, may God, I
destroyed so much crap trying to
desolder things. The Internet

173
00:20:16,292 --> 00:20:22,125
was not helpful. YouTube looked
to easy. I talked to my friend,
Joey. Head to your lab and they

174
00:20:22,125 --> 00:20:27,833
will help out. Shout out to the
labs in Virginia. Ted, mad
scientist, and evil genius

175
00:20:27,833 --> 00:20:34,958
helped me to do this. Did not
end up in the final one. And
Brian my solder tutor. Taught me

176
00:20:34,958 --> 00:20:42,417
the right iron and the right
solder make life a whole hell of
a lot easier. So now I can to

177
00:20:42,417 --> 00:20:48,458
make the collar itself. And hard
stuff. Man, I don't know how to
make a  collar. The code thing,

178
00:20:48,458 --> 00:20:53,167
I just learned to solder, but
this is like ribbons. So talking
to my friend Joe, he said get a 

179
00:20:53,167 --> 00:20:59,167
couple of ribbons and sew it
together and put your stuff
inside of it. So I went down to

180
00:20:59,167 --> 00:21:05,167
Michaels and got myself a 
ribbon, leopard print is just so
in this year for the cats. Now,

181
00:21:07,417 --> 00:21:14,333
I need to sew it together. Who
knows to sew, it is 2014. We
don't sew, we buy new stuff. It

182
00:21:14,333 --> 00:21:20,333
is a grandmother skill, right?
So what do you do? You get a 
grandmother. So my wife's

183
00:21:22,417 --> 00:21:28,750
grandmother, her name is Nancy.
She is very nice to meet you.
She was very happy to help me

184
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:34,625
and there is a dollar bill
followed by the battery, the
actual collar and the components

185
00:21:34,625 --> 00:21:41,708
all wrapped up to protect
things. The spark had flashy
bits. Now, back to our volunteer

186
00:21:41,708 --> 00:21:47,708
cat. This bastard still owes me
a  cell phone. So we're going to
send him out with some practice

187
00:21:50,333 --> 00:21:54,917
stuff first and see if he comes
back with it. Then I might let
him play with the tech. So we

188
00:21:54,917 --> 00:21:59,292
put the collar on him to see if
he tolerated it, he tolerate it,
and he tolerated marvelously.

189
00:21:59,292 --> 00:22:05,292
This is what it looked like
before and what it looks like
now. It is all cool, put you can

190
00:22:08,583 --> 00:22:15,458
see the bit behind his head.
That is the name collar it is to
go on the bottom because the GPS

191
00:22:15,458 --> 00:22:21,292
chip is directly opposite. We
have to put a  weight on it.
Went down to ranger supply. It

192
00:22:21,292 --> 00:22:27,042
is war kit. A  bullet. So the
cat goes on the collar, and the
collar goes on the cat. And the

193
00:22:27,042 --> 00:22:34,250
cat goes for a  walk and profit.
And the deployments were,
nothing. No, no. No. I knew it

194
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:38,792
works. I grabbed my stuff and
went to my buddy's Reeve's
house. All of the diagnostics

195
00:22:38,792 --> 00:22:46,292
work working fine. We put the
collar on the cat, and the cat,
we had a couple beers, the cat

196
00:22:46,292 --> 00:22:52,292
went under a  bush and hung out
there and licked himself for 20
minutes. He is licking himself.

197
00:22:54,375 --> 00:23:01,167
I said, Reeves is that the cat
under the bush. No, walked up.
Yes and he grabs the bush and

198
00:23:01,167 --> 00:23:07,167
shakes it. The cat was running.
A  better deployment process was
let the collar set outside 5 to

199
00:23:09,208 --> 00:23:15,208
10 minutes. Bring the cat to the
collar, put on the cat and let
the cat go for a  walk about. So

200
00:23:19,042 --> 00:23:24,833
does this work? Success,
bitches. Here is the initial
results for obvious reasons.

201
00:23:24,833 --> 00:23:30,542
Somebody contacted me off of the
Internet and said I can help you
out with visualizing this. Check

202
00:23:30,542 --> 00:23:38,125
this out. Somebody did this for
me. It is awesome. I would like
to point out I have been working

203
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:43,833
on this for a  good number of
months and the damn cat never
left the front yard. Yeah.

204
00:23:43,833 --> 00:23:49,833
Furthest he went was the car. My
grandmother was saying I would
love to know I Coco goes, so we

205
00:23:57,250 --> 00:24:02,792
strapped it up to Coco and got
results. I'd like to printout,
But we still have WEP and open

206
00:24:02,792 --> 00:24:08,792
Wi‑ Fi hotspots in 2014. Oh, my
God. So but cocoa went a lot
further as you will see. He

207
00:24:16,208 --> 00:24:22,208
wondered all over the
neighborhood. He's going to take
a  while. He actually caught a 

208
00:24:28,667 --> 00:24:36,500
mouse during this deployment
that was very, very cool. Really
cool results. The cats tolerated

209
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:41,500
it brilliantly, and it was the
fruition of a  long bunch of
work. I cannot tell you how

210
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:47,500
happy I was. So that is the war
kitty, ladies and gentlemen. [
Applause ] So now we move onto

211
00:24:57,083 --> 00:25:03,083
the Denial of Service Dog
admittedly is just trolling.
Nothing socially redeeming about

212
00:25:09,417 --> 00:25:16,958
it at all. I have a  pineapple I
bought at Shmoo, a  TV B Gone at
Radio Shack, doggie backpack

213
00:25:16,958 --> 00:25:21,667
with the service dog patches on
it. There is the pineapple, you
know what it is. I had Karma

214
00:25:21,667 --> 00:25:26,167
answering probes and DNS spoof
to redirect to the pineapple.
And there is a  package you can

215
00:25:26,167 --> 00:25:32,167
download that has five or six
things that it cycles through as
people connect to it. It is

216
00:25:34,417 --> 00:25:40,542
awesome. So he's the TV B Gone.,
as it comes with my new found
soldering skills I turned it,

217
00:25:40,542 --> 00:25:47,750
what was supposed to be this,
into this. And the idea being I
was going puts saddlebags and

218
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:51,833
the T.V. in the saddlebag and
connect the wires to the outside
so the LEDs were on the outside

219
00:25:51,833 --> 00:25:57,917
of the saddlebag. Now I need
patches. Holy crap, how hard is
it to get somebody to make your

220
00:25:57,917 --> 00:26:04,375
patches. Except on the Internet,
500 of them, $5  a  piece. So I
beat the streets for quite a 

221
00:26:04,375 --> 00:26:10,375
while, and I found a  JoAnnes in
Sterling,Virginia and they made
me a  denial of service dog

222
00:26:13,042 --> 00:26:20,250
patch. The Wi‑ Fi thing right
there. I have a video
demonstration to proof it works

223
00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:25,458
there. There is the denial of
service dog stuff. And the LED
sticking outside of the

224
00:26:25,458 --> 00:26:32,208
saddlebag. I ran a  wire up the
leash and have a  button in my
hand right there. Taped the wire

225
00:26:32,208 --> 00:26:37,708
to the leash. You hit the button
right there, you see the little
green light, and then they start

226
00:26:37,708 --> 00:26:45,625
flashing on the fruit and then
the T.V. will then just turn on.
And here's the demonstration

227
00:26:45,625 --> 00:26:51,625
video of it working. You've got,
I'm outside somewhere. You will
see that the denial of service

228
00:26:53,875 --> 00:26:59,125
dog has this ssid is up. Another
thing I did. I'm going to add a 
Wi‑ Fi hotspot, it is going to

229
00:26:59,125 --> 00:27:05,125
be called Defcon. And I'm
filming with one hand and doing
the other, forgive me, it took

230
00:27:07,958 --> 00:27:15,583
me a long time. I'm trying to
connect. That is me over here,
pop up and connect. And go out

231
00:27:15,583 --> 00:27:21,583
to the Internet, excuse us. >> I
said welcome to Def Con earlier.
We have a tradition here  ‑ ‑

232
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:31,500
and if you've never seen this
tradition, it is a wonderful
tradition where new speakers get

233
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:35,292
welcomed to Def Con with an
appropriate beverage of choice.
[ Applause ] So  ‑ ‑ since Gene

234
00:27:35,292 --> 00:27:41,292
has never spoken at Def Con
before, we decided to welcome
him, even to the extent of

235
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:51,792
interrupting his presentation.
We would like to welcome him to
Def Con for the first time

236
00:27:51,792 --> 00:27:57,792
speaker. [ Applause ] >> Good
morning. >> Thank you. >> Wow.
>> Here is the denial of service

237
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:11,750
dog. Awesome. So the long story 
‑ ‑ let's see, where I was? Yes.
I'm playing with this, I wish

238
00:28:17,875 --> 00:28:25,500
there was a  way to speed it up.
Are we going to go through it
all again? That is good stuff.

239
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:32,167
So I added Def Con to the whole
thing. And camera is going to
see the probe go out, it is me,

240
00:28:32,167 --> 00:28:38,125
and pull it back into the Wi‑ Fi
pineapple. That's how it all
works and it works brilliantly.

241
00:28:38,125 --> 00:28:44,125
So it will pop up, bam, I'm Def
Con. The funny part I tried to
do this later and there is the

242
00:28:46,167 --> 00:28:52,375
Def Con AP. See, I go up, it is
like. ¶ [ Music ] ¶ Circus  ‑ ‑
dot dot Afro. So I'm going to go

243
00:28:52,375 --> 00:28:58,375
to CNN and it is come to come
up, polk‑ a‑ dot polk‑ a‑ dot
Afro. That's how that things

244
00:29:08,333 --> 00:29:14,333
works. Now, we need a volunteer
dog, to be our denial of service
dog. If you ever seen a 

245
00:29:17,208 --> 00:29:23,667
Doberman pinscher service dog.
Well you have. The denial of
service dog. He was so happy, he

246
00:29:23,667 --> 00:29:29,667
ran the yard. I'm so happy, new
people, new people. So we dug
him inside of the house and put

247
00:29:35,792 --> 00:29:41,792
the backpack on him, he stood
like this for 10 minutes. And
that's good. Because it allowed

248
00:29:44,208 --> 00:29:50,208
me to take pictures. There is
the service dogs in there. And
that is going on there. The

249
00:29:52,625 --> 00:29:59,167
first thing the V dog did when
he stopped being comatose. What
we discovered two things. One

250
00:29:59,167 --> 00:30:06,792
there is now two ways to deploy
the TVB Gone, one is the button
and the other is the dog shakes.

251
00:30:06,792 --> 00:30:13,000
The other things I discovered
and failed to properly secure it
into the pouch. Every time he

252
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:19,375
did that, it well flying all
over the place. In the process
of doing so completely destroyed

253
00:30:19,375 --> 00:30:24,667
my TVB Gone to the point even
with my new soldering abilities
I was not able to bring it back.

254
00:30:24,667 --> 00:30:30,667
So next. So the funny thing is 
‑ ‑ if it says service dog on
your dog's backpack, they will

255
00:30:34,917 --> 00:30:40,917
let you in. [ Laughter ] Mine
very clearly said denial of
service. But service dog. Yeah.

256
00:30:43,208 --> 00:30:49,042
Sure. Here is the part I tell
you one man's video proof to
Defcon, is another man's

257
00:30:49,042 --> 00:30:55,792
evidence to court. The truth of
the matter is I, was so focused
on denial of service dog. I hit

258
00:30:55,792 --> 00:31:01,000
the wrong button on go pro. It
has 2 buttons, I hit the wrong
one, so I need to go ex KC on

259
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:07,000
you here. I love to play. Do you
mind if we come in. Sure. Do you
want something to drink. And

260
00:31:12,083 --> 00:31:18,083
then off here. Peanut jelly
time. Peanut butter jelly time.
[ Laughter ] I'm taking artistic

261
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:26,792
license here. Still. So the
third our four  ‑ ‑ or fourth
time the guy came to our table

262
00:31:26,792 --> 00:31:32,792
and said why does it say denial
of service dog. Props to this
guy, because he was the only one

263
00:31:35,125 --> 00:31:41,833
all day long that asked. We
didn't answer him, and he went
away. So you go to the sports

264
00:31:41,833 --> 00:31:49,125
bar and hit the bottom. Ball
play, and it was the world cup
game, just happens to be the

265
00:31:49,125 --> 00:31:55,125
Argentina and you hit the button
and it goes away. Never going to
give you up. [ Laughter ] So if

266
00:32:04,833 --> 00:32:10,833
you go into a  restaurant that
has 15 TVs on wall, they are
controlled by the back. But one

267
00:32:16,083 --> 00:32:22,083
or two TVs on the wall. They are
not. Just saying. So then  ‑ ‑
yeah. He is happy. Then we go

268
00:32:25,333 --> 00:32:31,333
into a  J random box store
someone. And the V dog is like I
love you. We're walking around

269
00:32:33,375 --> 00:32:38,583
the owner has his leash in one
hand and his hand on the
backpack. This is not a service

270
00:32:38,583 --> 00:32:44,917
dog. But nobody  ‑ ‑ and the guy
is like do you mind if we come
in. Sure. Make sure that he

271
00:32:44,917 --> 00:32:52,125
doesn't poop on anything. This
actually happened. And then we
go back to the TV section, and,

272
00:32:52,125 --> 00:32:57,667
of course, the V dog was like
squirrel, we hit the button and
the thing goes up and the

273
00:32:57,667 --> 00:33:05,125
television goes away, yeah! We
did wonderful things. Circus,
afro circus, Afro. So according

274
00:33:05,125 --> 00:33:11,125
to the results several victims
connected the denial of service
dog. I cannot definitively proof

275
00:33:13,917 --> 00:33:19,292
anyone connected why we are out
I took artistic license, however
when giving this presentation to

276
00:33:19,292 --> 00:33:25,292
my company, people were hacked
right and left. It's Gene. Only
one person asked about the

277
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:38,875
denial of service dog. Most
people just said nice doggie.
What have we learned? A  tech

278
00:33:38,875 --> 00:33:46,000
hobbyist with no experience can
create a  war collar in
relatively short time. You can

279
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:50,833
do this, too. I didn't go a 
damn thing about this stuff when
I was started. But I kept at it

280
00:33:50,833 --> 00:33:56,833
and in 2014 there are unsecured
hotspots. And lot of devices
still probed for stuff. There is

281
00:34:01,042 --> 00:34:07,042
no patch for human stupidity and
cats and dogs really hard to
work with. I have to give a 

282
00:34:16,917 --> 00:34:22,917
shout out to all of these
devices. JK devices they are
terrible. Don't go there.

283
00:34:37,042 --> 00:34:43,042
Reeves, still, Joe, Joey, Nancy,
Bill, the spark.io guys, the app
guys, V-dog, Skitzy CoCo,

284
00:34:57,667 --> 00:35:03,667
Tenacity, and, of course,
Defcon, I'm so proud to be here.
