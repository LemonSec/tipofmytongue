1
00:00:00,042 --> 00:00:06,500
So Ryan is going to come up here
and talk a little bit about how
we turn that around, right? So

2
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:11,417
every time, I'm looking forward
to this because every time I get
a request from the government to

3
00:00:11,417 --> 00:00:15,417
give somebody else documents, it
makes me happy to know that
somebody else is going to be

4
00:00:15,417 --> 00:00:21,417
fucking with the government the
other way around. So, Ryan is up
at MIT right now. He is not only

5
00:00:24,083 --> 00:00:30,542
a first time speaker but this is
his first time at DEF CON. So ‑‑
[Applause] Let's give a big

6
00:00:30,542 --> 00:00:36,542
party track welcome to Ryan
Shapiro who is going to talk
about hacking the FBI. [

7
00:00:39,417 --> 00:00:45,417
Applause ] Good luck. >> Thank
you all so much this is first
time at DEF CON that means

8
00:00:47,792 --> 00:00:53,792
someone might fuck with me so
bring it on. My name is Ryan
Shapiro, a little about myself.

9
00:00:56,625 --> 00:01:02,917
I'm a long time animal right
activist, social justice
activist, transparency activist

10
00:01:02,917 --> 00:01:08,042
now also a PhD candidate at MIT.
Where I am historian of the
political functioning of

11
00:01:08,042 --> 00:01:14,542
national security. This is a
talk about information and
democracy, about oppression and

12
00:01:14,542 --> 00:01:19,500
resistance and about the tools
that make resistance possible.
But first we're going to start

13
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:25,500
with a little bit of stroll down
memory lane. That is and so I've
always liked animals even as a

14
00:01:27,542 --> 00:01:31,958
little kid, nothing political
about it, here as I am as a
little kid with the goats.

15
00:01:31,958 --> 00:01:36,667
Around the time I was 12 I got
in to radical politics,
especially through punk rock.

16
00:01:36,667 --> 00:01:41,667
There I am in 8th grade this is
like '88 or something. Around
that same time I started

17
00:01:41,667 --> 00:01:46,292
thinking about animals in more
political terms, and decided to
go vegetarian really for me it

18
00:01:46,292 --> 00:01:52,083
was about justice, I have a
healthy self‑esteem but the idea
that another living being should

19
00:01:52,083 --> 00:01:57,250
lose his or her life merely to
satisfy 20 or 30 minutes of my
life, seemed unjust I stopped

20
00:01:57,250 --> 00:02:03,292
eating animals, I didn't know
anything about it. I just
stopped. Few years later I moved

21
00:02:03,292 --> 00:02:10,458
to New York to go to NYU around
that same time I also started
learning much more about

22
00:02:10,458 --> 00:02:15,958
animals ‑‑ excuse me ‑‑ animals
are actually treated on factory
farms routinely confined in

23
00:02:15,958 --> 00:02:22,125
cages so small they can't stand
up, turn around, spread their
limbs. Nine billion animals

24
00:02:22,125 --> 00:02:29,583
every year in the U.S., 63
billion globally. And around
that same time I went vegan

25
00:02:29,583 --> 00:02:34,958
based on what I was learning and
I also started deciding that I
could no longer simply not

26
00:02:34,958 --> 00:02:39,500
participate in the process, it
wasn't enough to simply not pay
people to kill and torture

27
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:45,500
animals but I needed to do
something about it. I cofounded
activists campaigns very

28
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:51,958
aggressive campaigns, got
arrested. Really constantly all
the time. This is my first

29
00:02:51,958 --> 00:02:57,458
arrest I'm in the red Vans. We
have welded, still rebar to
steel pipes where we are

30
00:02:57,458 --> 00:03:02,667
blocking the entrance to the
circus so the elephants can't
get in shutting down Ringling

31
00:03:02,667 --> 00:03:07,500
Circus, it worked. They were
able to get the elephants to the
top of the ramp held them to

32
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:13,167
until they urinated so we
marinated in elephant piss for a
few hours. (laughter) We were

33
00:03:13,167 --> 00:03:20,958
very popular in jail.
Nonetheless did I a lot of this
sort of work. Taking over the

34
00:03:20,958 --> 00:03:26,917
president of NYU's office to
shut down a laboratory where
they were forcing chimpanzees to

35
00:03:26,917 --> 00:03:33,833
smoke crack. There I am after
having locked my neck to a fur
store door. Basically the same

36
00:03:33,833 --> 00:03:38,667
thing, but inside a mall. I
think the camo pants and tie is
very distinguished look by the

37
00:03:38,667 --> 00:03:44,125
way. Then when New York police
got too good at cutting through
the steel pipes that we had

38
00:03:44,125 --> 00:03:51,292
locked our arms in they got very
good at it. We took oil drums
put the steel pipes in the oil

39
00:03:51,292 --> 00:03:55,833
drums then filled those oil
drums with concrete now the cops
would have to jack hammer

40
00:03:55,833 --> 00:04:00,208
through the concrete then cut
through, when they got too good
at that we put tar on the

41
00:04:00,208 --> 00:04:05,958
concrete, fire doors, got all
that going on here. I got far
better at the science of

42
00:04:05,958 --> 00:04:13,208
concrete than I ever expected
to. 	You can see it's extremely
disruptive. These were at least

43
00:04:13,208 --> 00:04:21,083
technically very successful
techniques. I moved to Hawaii
and shut down a captive dolphin

44
00:04:21,083 --> 00:04:26,625
facility in a shopping mall
along with a you Foo other
activists, got it banned in Maui

45
00:04:26,625 --> 00:04:30,917
county, which is several
islands. Did a bunch of whale
hunting sabotaging which I was

46
00:04:30,917 --> 00:04:37,917
riding the jet skis in between
the whales in order to prevent
the whalers from killing the

47
00:04:37,917 --> 00:04:44,917
whales. That's me on the boat.
Then so this is 2000. I moved
back from Hawaii to the east

48
00:04:44,917 --> 00:04:49,167
coast started getting a master's
degree in modern American
history and began cocoordinating

49
00:04:49,167 --> 00:04:56,125
the year long undercover
investigation of Foie Gras
factory farms, so these are duck

50
00:04:56,125 --> 00:05:01,792
farms. The conditions there are
the same as factor as far as
farms go for any other animals,

51
00:05:01,792 --> 00:05:04,458
they can't sit up, turn around,
spread their limbs. And this
investigation was tremendously

52
00:05:04,458 --> 00:05:10,750
successful. And we also openly
rescued a number of animals or
liberated or stole, what have

53
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:14,792
you, from these farms. The
investigation was very
successful we made documentary

54
00:05:14,792 --> 00:05:19,000
about it, it sparked national
and international campaigns, got
the sale of production of Foie

55
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,125
Gras banned in the state of
California, one of the only two
states that produce Foie Gras in

56
00:05:23,125 --> 00:05:27,625
the United States. And we
weren't the first people , the
people who did this with me. 	We

57
00:05:27,625 --> 00:05:31,292
weren't the first people to do
this set of work not the first
time that we had done this work

58
00:05:31,292 --> 00:05:37,292
but it was the first time that
someone was prosecuted for doing
it. And so this activist on the

59
00:05:39,292 --> 00:05:45,167
cover here and I, we were
prosecuted, we faced, we were
charged with felony burglary in

60
00:05:45,167 --> 00:05:49,375
the state of New York.
Seven‑year maximum we didn't
expect to get seven years but we

61
00:05:49,375 --> 00:05:55,792
had lengthy rap sheets in
New York and, if we were lucky
six months if we were unlucky

62
00:05:55,792 --> 00:05:59,708
two years. But it seemed like a
fair trade for us, obviously
that would suck going to prison,

63
00:05:59,708 --> 00:06:02,458
right? 	But it seemed like a
fair trade for the sort of work
that we were doing, we were

64
00:06:02,458 --> 00:06:09,583
happy with the campaign. I just
wanted to get my master's done
because it's hard to finish a

65
00:06:09,583 --> 00:06:13,792
master's from prison, I've
helped friends, it's rough. We
beat the charges against us, got

66
00:06:13,792 --> 00:06:20,167
40 hours of community service
for a group of our choice, we
chose an animal rights group, so

67
00:06:20,167 --> 00:06:25,417
we just got credit for doing
what we had already done.
(Laughter) 	But this left me in

68
00:06:25,417 --> 00:06:31,583
a difficult situation. So this
was 2004 right about the same
time we beat these charges

69
00:06:31,583 --> 00:06:37,875
there's a tremendous legislative
legal and prosecutorial shift in
the United States. In 2004 the

70
00:06:37,875 --> 00:06:42,708
FBI designated animal rights and
environmental movements, leading
domestic terror threat in the

71
00:06:42,708 --> 00:06:46,542
United States, leading domestic
terror threats, and this isn't
just rhetoric this is about

72
00:06:46,542 --> 00:06:50,750
resource allocation. Keep in
mind that neither the animal
rights nor environmental have

73
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:54,958
ever once physically injured a
single person in this country
ever and yet designated the

74
00:06:54,958 --> 00:07:00,792
leading domestic terror threats
in the United States. Shortly
thereafter there was passage of

75
00:07:00,792 --> 00:07:05,375
the animal enterprise terrorism
act or AETA which is a
pernicious piece of post 9/11

76
00:07:05,375 --> 00:07:11,750
legislation that targets animal
rights and environmental
activists as terrorists. What's

77
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:17,417
that? 	That is exactly right
animal liberation front has
never injured a single person

78
00:07:17,417 --> 00:07:22,250
here. Or any other country for
that matter. But let's hold
questions until the end, yes,

79
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:26,250
that's absolutely right. Neither
animal rights or environmental
movement have ever physically

80
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:30,667
entered single person in this
country ever, you can find
industry groups making arguments

81
00:07:30,667 --> 00:07:37,917
to the contrary but they are
simply wrong. They're just
simply wrong. 	Nonetheless, then

82
00:07:37,917 --> 00:07:41,875
animal enterprise terrorism act
which targets animal rights and
environmental activists as

83
00:07:41,875 --> 00:07:47,792
terrorist threats. 	People have
been prosecuted, the very first
prosecution under the AETA was a

84
00:07:47,792 --> 00:07:52,250
prosecution of animal rights
activists in California who
wrote anti‑slogans on the

85
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:57,292
sidewalk in chalk. There are
prosecuted as terrorists, felony
terrorism charges under federal

86
00:07:57,292 --> 00:08:02,167
law, mercifully the judge threw
out the charges, the FBI
investigated, the DOJ brought

87
00:08:02,167 --> 00:08:06,833
it. And around the same time
many of my closest friends and
colleagues including many of the

88
00:08:06,833 --> 00:08:11,875
people you see in these pictures
began going to jail, prison,
federal prison under this law

89
00:08:11,875 --> 00:08:17,542
and predecessor protection act.
These people who are among my
closest friends are known as the

90
00:08:17,542 --> 00:08:22,000
SHAC 7, they were sentenced from
between one to seven years in
federal prison for violation of

91
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,125
the animal enterprise protection
act for running a website.
Anti‑animal experimentation

92
00:08:26,125 --> 00:08:32,125
website. Exactly what happened.
	And so, I didn't know what to
do next. All of this is what

93
00:08:36,625 --> 00:08:41,958
journalists Will Potter turned
the green scare, disproportional
use of rhetoric and apparatus of

94
00:08:41,958 --> 00:08:46,542
national security to target
animal rights and environmental
activists. Green scare like red

95
00:08:46,542 --> 00:08:52,667
scare. And if you're interested
in more on this I'd encourage to
you check out the book, "Green

96
00:08:52,667 --> 00:09:00,292
is the New Red," or his blog,
also reports a lot on my work. I
really didn't know what to do

97
00:09:00,292 --> 00:09:06,667
next, right? 	I finished my
master's degree so I wasn't
going to do that, then entire

98
00:09:06,667 --> 00:09:11,750
model of activism that I pursued
for the previous decade was
relative impunity was all of the

99
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:16,833
sudden completely untenable.
It's one thing to go to prison
for six months or even year for

100
00:09:16,833 --> 00:09:21,333
rescuing many animals starting
international campaigns but to
go to prison as ‑‑ federal

101
00:09:21,333 --> 00:09:25,500
prison as terrorist on felony
charges for writing on sidewalk
in chalk that's just not a

102
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:30,250
reasonable exchange. I didn't
know what to do next and like
lots ever people who don't know

103
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:36,250
what to do next I stayed in grad
school. I started PhD at MIT as
I said political function with

104
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:46,125
national security I'm finishing
up that PhD now. My PhD is
looking at the long history of

105
00:09:46,125 --> 00:09:51,167
these sorts of trends, the long
history of the use of the
rhetoric and apparatus and

106
00:09:51,167 --> 00:09:56,250
national security to marginalize
animal protectionists as threats
to the state and there is a long

107
00:09:56,250 --> 00:10:00,958
history, just very little about
that now. For example, in World
War I when American

108
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:04,667
anti-experimentation people who
close animals experimentation
this street one of the

109
00:10:04,667 --> 00:10:09,125
newsletters from World War I
opposed war time animal
experimentation the research

110
00:10:09,125 --> 00:10:15,125
defendants community led by this
guy what is a famous
neurosurgeon, hi. >> We have a

111
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:26,750
tradition DEF CON for first time
speakers. It is way for us to
welcome them in to the community

112
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:31,167
I hope you guys are all
thoroughly enjoying his talk so
far. We don't follow those

113
00:10:31,167 --> 00:10:37,167
rules. >> All right. [ Cheers
and applause ] Party track!
Carry on. >> Thank you very

114
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:52,500
much. That's the best hazing
I've ever had. This guy who is
famous neurosurgeon, either way

115
00:10:55,292 --> 00:11:01,375
he wrote an article in
prestigious science magazine
which he argued, quote, that

116
00:11:01,375 --> 00:11:07,292
anyone attempting the stop the
rescue from assisting in
humanitarian and humane desire

117
00:11:07,292 --> 00:11:13,708
to prevent American soldiers
from being diseased is in
reality giving aid and comfort

118
00:11:13,708 --> 00:11:19,708
to the enemy. Went so far as to
call charges to be brought under
the espionage act. Charges

119
00:11:21,917 --> 00:11:27,500
weren't brought these these
allegations taking orders were
devastating to the animal

120
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:33,958
protection movement at that time
moving forward to World War II.
The descendants of the previous

121
00:11:33,958 --> 00:11:40,958
gentleman whose name was Keane,
that guy's name was Ivy. He was
a rock star animal experimenter

122
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:48,833
and vice president at the
university of Chicago. By the
way Ivy was the expert witness

123
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:53,250
on medical ethics at the
prosecution of Nazi doctors in
Nuremberg. Also the same time

124
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:57,875
lead of the American pro‑animal
experimentation community, a
group called The National

125
00:11:57,875 --> 00:12:01,917
Science and Medical Research,
when he came back from Nuremberg
and the press wanted to hear

126
00:12:01,917 --> 00:12:07,667
what he had to say about the
trial. You know what I learned
over there? 	The Nazis banned

127
00:12:07,667 --> 00:12:12,792
animal experimentation in 1933.
And this was why they had to
experiment on human beings in

128
00:12:12,792 --> 00:12:16,292
the concentration camps--
completely false. Absolutely
false. Just finished writing a

129
00:12:16,292 --> 00:12:23,000
hundred pages on it. I can speak
at length on it but I'm not
going to right now. He was lying

130
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,458
but the press ate it up only
reason Americans opposed animal
experimentation because they

131
00:12:27,458 --> 00:12:32,417
wanted to open concentration
camps in the United States. Then
within couple of years, with

132
00:12:32,417 --> 00:12:38,417
World War III more on American
minds than World War II. They
upped their game and they argued

133
00:12:42,375 --> 00:12:46,792
that because some animal
experiments involved radiation,
that American opposition to

134
00:12:46,792 --> 00:12:51,167
animal experimentation was a
plot in order to undermine
American security to give way

135
00:12:51,167 --> 00:12:57,375
for Soviet atomic aggression and
overthrow of the United States
government. 	As NSMR argued to

136
00:12:57,375 --> 00:13:02,042
the press, these are really
famous people. These aren't
random lobby groups these are

137
00:13:02,042 --> 00:13:06,042
tremendously prestigious
academics, "Time" Magazine
called IVY the conscience of

138
00:13:06,042 --> 00:13:10,500
American science. The fanatics
who opposed animal
experimentation for sentimental

139
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:16,042
reasons are being joined and
sometimes led by communists and
communist sympathizers

140
00:13:16,042 --> 00:13:19,917
interested in sabotaging
national defense. The National
Defense Project aims at

141
00:13:19,917 --> 00:13:24,333
minimizing death from possible
attacks of atomic bombs are
being crippled, and quote,

142
00:13:24,333 --> 00:13:30,667
foreign agents rejoice in every
victory scored by them. Even the
"Los Angeles Times" concurred

143
00:13:30,667 --> 00:13:36,167
declaring, it was quote, beyond
dispute that animal
experimentation is necessary to

144
00:13:36,167 --> 00:13:39,167
the national defense and
opposition to be placed directly
into the hands of the Russian

145
00:13:39,167 --> 00:13:43,583
communist and schemes to
overthrow the United States.
	This is the sort of press they

146
00:13:43,583 --> 00:13:48,667
routinely got. And these
campaigns were tremendously
successful, pharmaceuticals

147
00:13:48,667 --> 00:13:54,292
sponsored this ad which went
further if good comes from the
atomic bomb we need to thank

148
00:13:54,292 --> 00:13:59,333
animals more importantly animal
experimentation. Again, these
campaigns were devastating, this

149
00:13:59,333 --> 00:14:03,000
use of rhetoric and apparatus of
national security to marginalize
animal protection threats to the

150
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:08,917
state, absolutely devastating.
And there were by the way real
radiation experiments but they

151
00:14:08,917 --> 00:14:13,333
didn't look like this. They
looked like this. This is a live
pig in an atomic blast

152
00:14:13,333 --> 00:14:18,333
experiment. But we're going to
move forward back from the
actual red scare period to the

153
00:14:18,333 --> 00:14:25,167
green scare. 	For the work that
I've just gone through it was
archival, but it's not like the

154
00:14:25,167 --> 00:14:29,125
FBI is going to hand over their
documents very kindly to
archives around the country so

155
00:14:29,125 --> 00:14:35,083
that researchers can look and
see what's up. And I want to
know what's up. I want to be

156
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:40,958
able to answer the questions not
just from before the 1970s but I
want to understand ...I want to

157
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:45,500
understand how the animal rights
movement first came to the
attention of the FBI. How the

158
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:48,917
FBI understanding of animal
rights movement evolved over
time, how the movement is whole,

159
00:14:48,917 --> 00:14:53,333
and components parts. How they
develop infiltrators and most
importantly how they can

160
00:14:53,333 --> 00:14:56,833
designate the movement of
leading domestic terror threat
in the country without injuring

161
00:14:56,833 --> 00:15:01,458
a single person ever. Since
there was no archival source
base only thing that I could

162
00:15:01,458 --> 00:15:06,167
think of in order to do this
dissertation work which is the
Freedom of Information Act. I

163
00:15:06,167 --> 00:15:12,167
knew very little about FOIA at
that time. I know it existed I
submitted the requests just to

164
00:15:12,167 --> 00:15:18,167
see what would happen. I
submitted a request on myself to
the FBI and I got this letter

165
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:26,042
back which said they didn't have
anything. And in addition to
being a little surprised I admit

166
00:15:26,042 --> 00:15:32,958
to being a little hurt really.
	All right, that's fine, a
little humility, that's fine. I

167
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:39,542
submitted request on (inaudible)
you saw also been prosecuted
with me and as opposed to me

168
00:15:39,542 --> 00:15:43,833
when he I had been arrested that
last time for the duck
liberation which was just cops

169
00:15:43,833 --> 00:15:47,583
when they came to arrest her
there was an FBI agent involved.
I was very confident that they

170
00:15:47,583 --> 00:15:53,583
wouldn't have documents on her.
Again, sent back letter they had
nothing. Wow, that's really

171
00:15:55,708 --> 00:16:00,833
strange. So I submitted another
request this time, all right, I
got this now. I submitted

172
00:16:00,833 --> 00:16:04,500
request for a friend of mine I
knew they would have documents
on her, the FBI raided their

173
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:09,458
house they must have some
information on this person.
Again, letter came back,

174
00:16:09,458 --> 00:16:16,292
nothing. 	So I was like, oh, I
get it, I'm being lied to,
right? Keep in mind, I've been

175
00:16:16,292 --> 00:16:20,542
involved as I said radical
politics since I was 12, the
idea that the FBI is fucked up

176
00:16:20,542 --> 00:16:27,958
is not something new to me I
guess I naively assumed that the
FBI's division might be less

177
00:16:27,958 --> 00:16:34,000
mission driven than all its
investigative wing. And I
realize very quickly, though,

178
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:40,917
that I was wrong. But then it
raised some question, the
question was how? How is the FBI

179
00:16:40,917 --> 00:16:45,708
systematically avoiding
compliance with the Freedom of
Information Act. How is the

180
00:16:45,708 --> 00:16:50,708
leading federal law enforcement
agency in the country succeeding
in consistently and flagrantly

181
00:16:50,708 --> 00:16:57,667
violating federal law, the
Freedom of Information Act. So I
became obsessed with mapping out

182
00:16:57,667 --> 00:17:02,500
not only nature and evolution of
the campaign against animal
rights movement but also mapping

183
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:08,750
out the precise mechanisms of
the FBI's non‑compliance with
the Freedom of Information Act.

184
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:14,042
We all have traits that at any
given time may prove to be
advantageous or detrimental. In

185
00:17:14,042 --> 00:17:21,458
this case my OCD and need for
conflict proved to be pretty
beneficial I became absolutely

186
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:27,292
obsessed. I began submitting
hundreds of FOIA requests, with
each request designed, not only

187
00:17:27,292 --> 00:17:32,375
request of records by FBI and
animal rights matters, but also
to determine the precise

188
00:17:32,375 --> 00:17:38,000
mechanisms of FBI FOIA
non‑compliance. I submit request
comes out in the end, what

189
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:43,708
happens in that black box how do
they get away with it? 	Part of
the problem is historical. In

190
00:17:43,708 --> 00:17:49,292
1947 when congress amended the
Freedom of Information Act to
actually target the intelligence

191
00:17:49,292 --> 00:17:54,083
agencies. No small part because
of Watergate, all the
revelations that were coming out

192
00:17:54,083 --> 00:18:01,042
at that moment. The intelligence
agency freaked out, tried to
destroy FOIA and tried to

193
00:18:01,042 --> 00:18:05,417
statutorily exempt themselves
from it. Some of the agencies
had better luck with that than

194
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:11,083
others. And the FBI only had
maybe mediocre luck, so they had
to come up with who knows how

195
00:18:11,083 --> 00:18:16,333
many dirty tricks in order to
avoid compliance with FOIA. And
I was seeking to figure out what

196
00:18:16,333 --> 00:18:20,625
those tricks were, but it was
very difficult to do that
because the information was

197
00:18:20,625 --> 00:18:26,083
secret and the primary tool we
would have to do it was to
choose FOIA. 	It was something

198
00:18:26,083 --> 00:18:31,792
of a challenge, I began
submitting hundreds ever
requests, I analyzed and

199
00:18:31,792 --> 00:18:37,708
compared hundreds of their
responses. I thought it of a
process to map out bottom of the

200
00:18:37,708 --> 00:18:43,583
ocean as a submarine using sonar
pings so even if I got nothing
back document‑wise the manner in

201
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:49,083
which they denied the requests
was very useful. Over a period
of years, just obsessing over

202
00:18:49,083 --> 00:18:55,083
this data, picture began to
coalesce. I also started
submitting FOIA requests about

203
00:18:57,750 --> 00:19:02,583
the processing of my FOIA
request, FOIA requests about how
they actually failed to comply

204
00:19:02,583 --> 00:19:07,083
with the previous request.
That's very successful strategy,
now as a result they have a

205
00:19:07,083 --> 00:19:12,500
policy where they refuse to
comply with FOIA requests about
FOIA requests, so have a lawsuit

206
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:17,167
against the FBI right now
challenging the policy about not
complying with FOIA requests

207
00:19:17,167 --> 00:19:24,458
about FOIA requests. 	(Laughter)
	I also scoured the case law for
information about FBI FOIA

208
00:19:24,458 --> 00:19:28,208
operations, I scoured FBI
litigation declaration on
information on FBI FOIA

209
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:34,208
operations, just as I said, it
was obsessive amounts of work
over a period of years. And in

210
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:42,500
the process two things became
very apparent. One, the FBI does
nearly everything in its power

211
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:48,042
to avoid compliance with the
Freedom of Information Act.
Indeed if FOIA worked with some

212
00:19:48,042 --> 00:19:53,625
agencies as akin to customer
service from a giant Telecom
over a holiday weekend it's

213
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:58,125
going to suck, take a long time,
going to be frustrated. Might
get something it will be

214
00:19:58,125 --> 00:20:03,000
alright. FOIA work with the FBI
is a street fight they will do
everything they can to avoid

215
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:08,042
compliance. Difficult to over
state the bad faith which the
FBI is operating when it comes

216
00:20:08,042 --> 00:20:15,458
to matters of the Freedom of
Information Act. 	Two, essential
to making the Freedom of

217
00:20:15,458 --> 00:20:20,875
Information Act work with the
FBI was developing an intimate
familiarity with the bureau's

218
00:20:20,875 --> 00:20:27,500
FOIA specific information
storage and retrieval systems
and using the above techniques

219
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:33,500
and others I did just that. All
of which allowed me to pursue an
iterative approach to FOIA

220
00:20:35,708 --> 00:20:40,833
requests where I would figure
out the various road blocks that
they were using to prevent the

221
00:20:40,833 --> 00:20:47,042
records that I wanted. I would
finally get something, any
record then once I got that, one

222
00:20:47,042 --> 00:20:53,042
could comb those records to find
specifics to get around other
road blocks and this iterative

223
00:20:55,208 --> 00:21:00,708
approach was just tremendously
useful. It was also helpful that
I got signed privacy waivers

224
00:21:00,708 --> 00:21:04,542
from roughly 300 leading animal
rights and environmental
activists from the 1970s to the

225
00:21:04,542 --> 00:21:09,000
present allowing me to request
their records doesn't mean the
FBI would give them to me but I

226
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:15,000
have a lot more flexibility in
what I do on my end. 	And this
really began to pay off, combine

227
00:21:18,042 --> 00:21:22,292
these and other experimental
FOIA methodologies that I
developed proved stunningly

228
00:21:22,292 --> 00:21:28,083
successful and I received over
40,000 pages from the FBI on
their campaigns against the

229
00:21:28,083 --> 00:21:33,292
animal rights and environmental
movements. Among the most
notable of these documents was a

230
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:38,250
document I obtained which
demonstrated FBI considerations
of animal enterprise terrorism

231
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:43,292
act charges against undercover
investigators who exposed
factory farming cruelty. This

232
00:21:43,292 --> 00:21:48,708
document here. And despite
nonetheless extremely telling.
The FBI is arguing not even

233
00:21:48,708 --> 00:21:53,125
arguing what we see here that
the FBI is doing is trying to
bring federal terrorism charges

234
00:21:53,125 --> 00:21:59,125
against people who take pictures
of animals trapped in cages.
Terrorism charges against those

235
00:22:01,375 --> 00:22:06,667
individuals who take those
pictures and I'll note I was
especially displeased to see my

236
00:22:06,667 --> 00:22:14,042
name on this document. This
document is currently being used
as evidence in a federal lawsuit

237
00:22:14,042 --> 00:22:19,375
challenging the
constitutionality of the animal
enterprise terrorism act. This

238
00:22:19,375 --> 00:22:23,875
is on one of the five plaintiffs
in this lawsuit we're
represented by the New York City

239
00:22:23,875 --> 00:22:29,750
base center for constitutional
rights. And we actually just
asked the Supreme Court to

240
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:35,750
review the case just this very
week. So, right, it's working. I
figure out all the ways FBI was

241
00:22:38,625 --> 00:22:43,500
avoiding compliance, I beat
those ways, and the FBI said
"Oh, you're very clever, look

242
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:49,542
what you can do, watch what we
can do." They sat on their
fucking hands and did nothing

243
00:22:49,542 --> 00:22:55,542
because they can. 	FOIA is
entirely toothless and it's one
of the giant problems with the

244
00:22:57,792 --> 00:23:02,125
Freedom of Information Act.
Though the Freedom of
Information Act only allows an

245
00:23:02,125 --> 00:23:08,458
agency 20 working days to comply
with the request, there are no
penalties for non‑compliance.

246
00:23:08,458 --> 00:23:14,250
The FBI just sat on my requests,
not 20 days, not months, years
some of them. And so I sued the

247
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:17,917
FBI for failure to comply with
the Freedom of Information Act.
There's no penalties for

248
00:23:17,917 --> 00:23:23,458
non‑compliance but you can sue
if they're in violation of the
law. And so I did, I sued them

249
00:23:23,458 --> 00:23:28,750
and is my first lawsuit against
the FBI, covers about 80 of my
animal rights related Freedom of

250
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:36,625
Information Act requests. And
what was supposed to happen here
is that the judge did,

251
00:23:36,625 --> 00:23:42,083
essentially she said, obviously
you're in violation of the law,
it's way past 20 days, it's

252
00:23:42,083 --> 00:23:46,167
years in some cases. When are
you going to get to this? Not
when you give him the documents,

253
00:23:46,167 --> 00:23:51,125
but when will you'd decide to do
the work? Or the reasons why
you're not going to give them to

254
00:23:51,125 --> 00:23:57,292
him. Instead the FBI responded
by invoking what is consider the
nuclear option in a FOIA case

255
00:23:57,292 --> 00:24:03,417
which is called open America
stay. Which is kind of just
extreme delay which is

256
00:24:03,417 --> 00:24:10,125
essentially a total exemption
from FOIA for specified period
of time. And in my case, the FBI

257
00:24:10,125 --> 00:24:17,417
is asking for almost unheard of
seven‑year open America stay. So
they want seven years to do

258
00:24:17,417 --> 00:24:23,417
nothing, to think about what to
do about my FOIA requests. 	And
what's particularly outrageous

259
00:24:26,458 --> 00:24:30,125
about this, and uh honestly I
think that's particularly
outrageous, is that the core

260
00:24:30,125 --> 00:24:36,125
element of the FBI's motion for
open America stay is a radically
updated version of a Cold War

261
00:24:41,333 --> 00:24:47,125
era FOIA secrecy doctrine known
as Mosaic Theory. Mosaic theory
is somewhat plausible on its

262
00:24:47,125 --> 00:24:53,000
face, any individual bit of
information by itself may be
innocuous but once you combine

263
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:58,792
it with other information who
knows what the Soviets will be
able to do with it. 	And so a

264
00:24:58,792 --> 00:25:04,125
sort of, umm, like a classic
example would be someone submits
a FOIA request to the FBI for

265
00:25:04,125 --> 00:25:09,917
all unpaid parking tickets from
FBI agents and the FBI says,
well, we can't give those to you

266
00:25:09,917 --> 00:25:14,417
because once you have those, who
knows what the Soviets could
learn from our unpaid parking

267
00:25:14,417 --> 00:25:19,667
tickets, right? 	Again, it's
sort of plausible on its face
but not really, no information

268
00:25:19,667 --> 00:25:25,292
is understood is in a vacuum,
all information is understood
Mosaically. But nonetheless...

269
00:25:25,292 --> 00:25:31,417
and Mosaic Theory had been in
disuse by the time that my case
came around. But not only did

270
00:25:31,417 --> 00:25:36,000
the FBI bring it back, is
bringing it back but they are
doing so in a radically updated

271
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,583
version. Old Mosaic Theory is
specific to the document, it's
at the document level. We cannot

272
00:25:40,583 --> 00:25:44,917
give you this document because
we don't know what you're going
to combine it with. In this case

273
00:25:44,917 --> 00:25:49,708
the FBI is arguing not of the
document level but at universe
of knowledge level. We can't

274
00:25:49,708 --> 00:25:54,000
decide whether or not to give
you these records that you
requested which is about 350,000

275
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:59,542
pages in this lawsuit. We can't
decide to give you these pages
because of the universe of

276
00:25:59,542 --> 00:26:03,125
knowledge that exists outside of
them. We need to think about
each of these pages in relation

277
00:26:03,125 --> 00:26:06,875
to every other document that
exist in the public record about
FBI that the FBI has about

278
00:26:06,875 --> 00:26:10,875
animal rights movement that
someone else might request about
the animal rights movement so

279
00:26:10,875 --> 00:26:16,125
it's not we can't give you
document X because mosaic, it's
we can't process these requests

280
00:26:16,125 --> 00:26:20,500
because we have to think about
the entire universe of knowledge
before we do. And by the way

281
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:26,792
that universe of knowledge is
always updating so it's going to
take us awhile. 	I mean, it's

282
00:26:26,792 --> 00:26:33,417
just like it is flatly
outrageous move. And worse at
the core of all of this, is a

283
00:26:33,417 --> 00:26:39,125
supposed national security risk.
The FBI is arguing order to make
this preposterous claim, FBI

284
00:26:39,125 --> 00:26:44,292
arguing that my dissertation,
FOIA research methodologies,
constitute a threat to national

285
00:26:44,292 --> 00:26:49,667
security. And which by the way,
thank you, that's going to look
great on the back of the book.

286
00:26:49,667 --> 00:26:55,667
Keep in mind that the FBI is not
arguing that the release of
documents, about 350,000 pages

287
00:27:00,083 --> 00:27:07,000
in this case, would be a threat
to national security, but rather
the FBI is arguing that deciding

288
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:12,958
whether or not to release the
documents before seven years
would be a threat to national

289
00:27:12,958 --> 00:27:19,250
security. 	Further, the
purported risk to national
security posed by my

290
00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:25,500
dissertation research, according
to the FBI, is ostensively so
grave that the FBI can't even

291
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:30,875
tell us what that risk is. The
FBI's primary support for its
argument submitted that these

292
00:27:30,875 --> 00:27:36,875
like double-ly preposterous
contentions is submitted to the
court in order of exparte in

293
00:27:39,792 --> 00:27:44,000
camera declaration, which is
essentially a secret letter from
the terrorism division of the

294
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:50,042
FBI to the judge about why they
can't tell us why they can't
tell us why my dissertation FOIA

295
00:27:50,042 --> 00:27:56,125
research about animal rights
movement is such a threat to
national security. 	It's

296
00:27:56,125 --> 00:28:03,500
important to note here that
though the FBI of course doesn't
want damning information coming

297
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:07,458
out about their campaign against
the animal rights movement it
will be embarrassing for them

298
00:28:07,458 --> 00:28:11,042
that's not really what this is
about at all. Their core
motivation here is preserving

299
00:28:11,042 --> 00:28:18,500
their functional immunity from
the Freedom of Information Act.
The FBI has viewed political

300
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:22,792
decent as a security threat
since its earliest days since J.
Edgar Hoover coordinated the

301
00:28:22,792 --> 00:28:29,208
Palmer raids right after World
War 1. J. Edgar Hoover and FBI
viewed political decent as a

302
00:28:29,208 --> 00:28:33,458
security threat and ever since
the freedom of information act
was amended in 1974 to target

303
00:28:33,458 --> 00:28:39,500
the FBI, the FBI understood the
Freedom of Information Act in
the very same light. And that's

304
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:45,500
what we have here, an attempted
broad scale end run around FOIA
by the FBI. Indeed the FBI

305
00:28:47,792 --> 00:28:55,167
strategy here is so radical if
the judge accept its it can shut
down anyone's FOIA request and

306
00:28:55,167 --> 00:28:59,667
that's why a host of open
government groups, the national
lawyers guild, constitutional

307
00:28:59,667 --> 00:29:05,708
rights, national security
archive have joined in opposing
the FBI's efforts to shut down

308
00:29:05,708 --> 00:29:11,708
my dissertation FOIA research.
	But the FBI is not alone. And
what they were really trying to

309
00:29:15,167 --> 00:29:21,208
do here is not only, of course
trying to do end run around FOIA
makes sure that essentially FOIA

310
00:29:21,208 --> 00:29:24,833
has never really worked with the
FBI for broad scale research.
Every once in awhile someone

311
00:29:24,833 --> 00:29:28,458
submits a request maybe get
something they are thrilled that
they got something think it's a

312
00:29:28,458 --> 00:29:33,458
victory but it's not. For broad
scale research if you know what
you want you're trying to get a

313
00:29:33,458 --> 00:29:37,458
lot of documents you want to get
it and the law says you should
be able to get it, FOIA has not

314
00:29:37,458 --> 00:29:43,292
worked with the FBI on this
level. Other agencies, yes, not
the FBI. And so the FBI is

315
00:29:43,292 --> 00:29:45,917
trying to preserve its
functional immunity from the
Freedom of Information Act from

316
00:29:45,917 --> 00:29:53,250
everyone and from me but... this
issue remains on the judge's
desk, and it has been on her

317
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:56,792
desk for two years now. The
Freedom of Information Act
whether they get this stay on

318
00:29:56,792 --> 00:30:03,792
mosaic issue. On mosaic theory
grounds we're waiting for a
ruling from her now. 	Rather

319
00:30:03,792 --> 00:30:09,542
than shutting down my work I've
just dramatically expanded it, I
can't do much work on the animal

320
00:30:09,542 --> 00:30:13,500
rights movement right now
because it's all tied up in this
lawsuit. And so I now have a

321
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:20,667
series of non‑animal rights
related FOIA projects against
the FBI and other agencies. I

322
00:30:20,667 --> 00:30:24,542
now have over 800 FOIA requests
in motion with the FBI which
likely makes me the person with

323
00:30:24,542 --> 00:30:30,583
the most ever. I now have seven
lawsuits against the FBI and
other agencies for failure to

324
00:30:30,583 --> 00:30:34,625
comply with the Freedom of
Information Act covering
hundreds of my requests. And

325
00:30:34,625 --> 00:30:40,625
again, the FBI is not alone
here. In their absolute allergy
to transparency. The United

326
00:30:42,833 --> 00:30:48,833
States intelligence apparatus
more broadly shares this same
allergy and I am targeting this

327
00:30:55,375 --> 00:30:59,458
in a series of my other
projects. So, for example, I
have a FOIA project dealing with

328
00:30:59,458 --> 00:31:04,042
Nelson Mandela. I have FOIA
request to the FBI, the CIA, the
DIA, and the NSA, on records on

329
00:31:04,042 --> 00:31:08,167
Nelson Mandela I want to know
what control the CIA had in
Mandela's 1962 arrest leading to

330
00:31:08,167 --> 00:31:11,792
his decades of incarceration for
struggle for racial justice and
democracy in South Africa. It's

331
00:31:11,792 --> 00:31:17,042
very likely that the CIA was
intimately involved in that
process. Also want to know why

332
00:31:17,042 --> 00:31:23,833
Nelson remained on the watch
list until 2008. Long after he
received the Nobel prize, prize

333
00:31:23,833 --> 00:31:29,375
from the president, prize from
congress. And yet on the U.S.
terror watch list until 2008.

334
00:31:29,375 --> 00:31:35,875
All four of these agencies
denied my FOIA request, the FBI,
CIA, DIA,and NSA. The most

335
00:31:35,875 --> 00:31:41,875
notable denial was from the NSA.
And the NSA refuses to even
confirm or deny existence of

336
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:49,125
records on Mandela. The mere
fact according to the NSA, is
the existence or nonexistence of

337
00:31:49,125 --> 00:31:55,583
record is itself classified in
the interest of national
security. Further the NSA also

338
00:31:55,583 --> 00:32:01,583
invoked again the Espionage Act
of 1917 to justify their denial
of my request. I am making quite

339
00:32:03,833 --> 00:32:10,583
good head way in court I'm suing
all of these agencies for these
violations of the FOIA. And

340
00:32:10,583 --> 00:32:16,167
represented by excellent FOIA
attorney, specialist Jeffrey
Light, based out of DC. I am

341
00:32:16,167 --> 00:32:21,750
making excellent progress right
now on the FBI in court, and
I've already received good

342
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:28,917
number of documents from the
FBI. On Nelson Mandela these
documents like this one,

343
00:32:28,917 --> 00:32:32,750
revealed that while the FBI was
supposed to be protecting
Mandela in 1990, after he got

344
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:37,833
out of prison after 30 years
because the CIA put him there.
The FBI instead of protecting

345
00:32:37,833 --> 00:32:43,042
him in addition to protecting
him was cultivating confidential
informants within Mandela's

346
00:32:43,042 --> 00:32:48,083
inner circle in order to spy on
Mandela and provide political
information on Mandela to the

347
00:32:48,083 --> 00:32:52,875
FBI. Further documents have
received from the FBI in my
lawsuit against them higher

348
00:32:52,875 --> 00:32:56,250
demonstrate that the FBI
understood anti‑apartheid
movement, not just Mandela, but

349
00:32:56,250 --> 00:33:01,250
the anti-apartheid, on the
whole. Essentially as a Soviet
inspired communist threat to

350
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:07,208
American national security just
as they understood Martin Luther
King to be. The FBI kept this

351
00:33:07,208 --> 00:33:13,375
understanding of Nelson Mandela
and anti‑apartheid movement as
threats to American security

352
00:33:13,375 --> 00:33:18,000
even after the fall of the
Berlin wall. 	Even as the Cold
War crumbled in to obsolescence

353
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:22,083
the FBI remained obsessed with
Nelson Mandela and the
anti‑Apartheid movement being a

354
00:33:22,083 --> 00:33:28,542
Soviet threat to the United
States. Also have a FOIA
request, or request and lawsuit

355
00:33:28,542 --> 00:33:32,125
against the FBI for their
failure to comply with knows
records on sniper plot against

356
00:33:32,125 --> 00:33:38,083
occupy Houston. Turns out that
probably some militia group was
planning to assassinate occupy

357
00:33:38,083 --> 00:33:44,083
leaders in Houston and FBI was
interested in monitoring the
activities of the occupiers

358
00:33:44,083 --> 00:33:48,917
rather than terrorist who
actually plot to murder
the occupiers in court arguing

359
00:33:48,917 --> 00:33:52,833
they shouldn't have to give me
these records because occupy was
a bunch of terrorists and

360
00:33:52,833 --> 00:33:59,042
national security threat. The
judge had very good ruling here
and said that the FBI

361
00:33:59,042 --> 00:34:03,083
can't simply evoke these words
talesmontically, national
security, or terrorism, they

362
00:34:03,083 --> 00:34:07,917
actually have to back it up. I
think they failed to do that
entirely and were waiting on the

363
00:34:07,917 --> 00:34:13,625
judge to decide what she thinks
right now. Also have ongoing
lawsuit against the FBI for

364
00:34:13,625 --> 00:34:18,958
they're failure to comply with
the Freedom of Information Act
on Aaron Schwartz. Also have

365
00:34:18,958 --> 00:34:22,875
ongoing FOIA request and lawsuit
against FBI as I mentioned
earlier for failure to comply

366
00:34:22,875 --> 00:34:28,333
with the FOIA request about my
FOIA request. (Laughter) 	Then
there's a bunch more coming in

367
00:34:28,333 --> 00:34:34,333
the pipeline, too. But all of
this brings us back to the
Freedom of Information Act is

368
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:43,833
one of the most under
appreciated elements of the
entire American experiment.

369
00:34:43,833 --> 00:34:48,125
Notion that the records of
government are the property of
the people and all we need to do

370
00:34:48,125 --> 00:34:55,708
to is to ask for them is
radically democratic but FOIA is
broken. And this is just one

371
00:34:55,708 --> 00:35:02,958
element of the ongoing crisis of
secrecy we now face. Harvard
Historian of Science, Peter

372
00:35:02,958 --> 00:35:07,958
Galeson has demonstrated that
the universe of classified
knowledge now exponentially

373
00:35:07,958 --> 00:35:12,000
exceeds the universe of
published unclassified
knowledge. And that this

374
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:17,083
disparity grows by the day.
There is literally exponentially
more classified information in

375
00:35:17,083 --> 00:35:22,208
the world right now than there
is unpublished classified
information. Classification just

376
00:35:22,208 --> 00:35:26,417
one part of the problem. It's
far from the whole ever it. Most
of the records that I'm seeking

377
00:35:26,417 --> 00:35:31,917
from the FBI such as 350,000
pages at issue in my open
America animal rights lawsuit

378
00:35:31,917 --> 00:35:37,917
with the FBI, aren't classify,
the FBI just refuses to give
them up. In fact the FBI and DOJ

379
00:35:39,958 --> 00:35:45,250
on the whole invokes
classification only about 5% of
the time when denying FOIA

380
00:35:45,250 --> 00:35:51,333
requests. The other 95% they're
just saying fuck you, no. Using
one of the other exemptions but

381
00:35:51,333 --> 00:35:57,375
not classification, these aren't
classified documents they're
just saying no. The secrecy is a

382
00:35:57,375 --> 00:36:05,250
cancer on the body of democracy.
It is a cancer on the body of
democracy and despite entering

383
00:36:05,250 --> 00:36:11,458
office promising to be the most
transparent administration ever,
the Obama administration has out

384
00:36:11,458 --> 00:36:19,417
done even Bush on this front.
Obama administration has brought
more FBI prosecutions of

385
00:36:19,417 --> 00:36:25,083
whistleblowers than all previous
administrations combined. And as
we associated press recently

386
00:36:25,083 --> 00:36:29,292
reported, the Obama
administration as invoked
national security to deny FOIA

387
00:36:29,292 --> 00:36:37,042
requests more than ever before.
The records of the government
are property of the people. As

388
00:36:37,042 --> 00:36:42,250
we have seen these records are
consistently withheld from us on
the basis undefined national

389
00:36:42,250 --> 00:36:49,375
security concerns. Yet what do
we mean by national security. We
need to start asking who we are

390
00:36:49,375 --> 00:36:54,500
as a nation and what it means
for us to be secure. In the
United States since 9/11

391
00:36:54,500 --> 00:37:01,750
depending on how you define the
term, roughly a few dozen people
have been killed by terrorism.

392
00:37:01,750 --> 00:37:06,542
And not including 9/11, since
1970, the number of people
killed by terrorism in the

393
00:37:06,542 --> 00:37:12,458
United States is about 500.
There's a question for you
according to the centers for

394
00:37:12,458 --> 00:37:18,458
disease control about how many
Americans die every year falling
out of bed? Any guesses? Not

395
00:37:21,167 --> 00:37:28,292
thousands but a lot. It's 400
up, up there, right. Which is
still pretty remarkable. Most

396
00:37:28,292 --> 00:37:34,625
importantly that means almost as
many people die every year in
the United States falling out of

397
00:37:34,625 --> 00:37:41,583
bed than have died from
terrorism in the United States
excluding 9/11 since 1970. And

398
00:37:41,583 --> 00:37:46,500
yet we don't install
surveillance cameras in people's
bedrooms. We don't monitor those

399
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:51,417
going in and out of mattress
stores. We don't put heavy
sleepers on watch lists. So why

400
00:37:51,417 --> 00:37:57,417
are we so willing to sacrifice
our most cherished liberties
over a vastly smaller threat.

401
00:37:59,958 --> 00:38:05,667
Again, what do we mean by
national security. As wrote the
judge Murray Gerfine judge and

402
00:38:05,667 --> 00:38:10,792
his ruling against Nixon
administration infamous attempt
to prevent the "New York Times"

403
00:38:10,792 --> 00:38:16,417
from publishing the leaked
Pentagon papers, quote, the
security of the nation is not at

404
00:38:16,417 --> 00:38:24,167
the ramparts alone, security
also lies in the values ever our
free institutions. Building upon

405
00:38:24,167 --> 00:38:28,167
this ruling, we as a nation need
to foster a broader
understanding of national

406
00:38:28,167 --> 00:38:32,750
security. We need to embrace
understanding in which the
security of our nation is best

407
00:38:32,750 --> 00:38:37,958
maintained not by secrecy and
surveillance and drone strikes
but rather by the free exchange

408
00:38:37,958 --> 00:38:43,958
of ideas among informed
citizenry. Such a citizenry is
impossible, however, without

409
00:38:43,958 --> 00:38:50,042
broad public access to
information, about the
operations of government. In the

410
00:38:50,042 --> 00:38:57,000
interest of promoting such a
citizenry, all available tools
need to be used. I've used FOIA

411
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:03,000
to hack the FBI but FOIA is
broken. And even at its best
FOIA can only go so far. Other

412
00:39:05,833 --> 00:39:12,125
forms of information access are
now necessary. This can in part
be done in the form of heroic

413
00:39:12,125 --> 00:39:18,125
whistleblowers and leakers like
Snowden, and Manning, Elsburg.
However when FOIA is broken, and

414
00:39:20,167 --> 00:39:25,083
when there are sadly not enough
whistleblowers to be found,
another form of hacking is

415
00:39:25,083 --> 00:39:31,667
required to return the records
of government to their rightful
owners. Breaking in and taking

416
00:39:31,667 --> 00:39:38,333
those records. And there's a
historical precedent here, in
1971 a group calling it the

417
00:39:38,333 --> 00:39:43,000
citizens commission to
investigate the FBI. Broke in to
an FBI office in Media,

418
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:48,292
Pennsylvania, and liberated the
records that informed the world
of the FBI's notorious counter

419
00:39:48,292 --> 00:39:54,542
intelligence program, this is
how we learned of the FBI's
illegal and unconstitutional

420
00:39:54,542 --> 00:39:59,667
surveillance, suppression,
likely at times murder of
anti‑war activists, civil rights

421
00:39:59,667 --> 00:40:03,167
activists, free speech
activists, this is how we
learned of J. Edgar Hoover's

422
00:40:03,167 --> 00:40:09,125
obsession with Martin Luther
King Jr., including the request
to have King kill himself

423
00:40:09,125 --> 00:40:15,083
because Hoover believed king to
be a communist threat and it's
because brave individuals broke

424
00:40:15,083 --> 00:40:19,625
in to this FBI office stole
those records that we knew about
this. People then began

425
00:40:19,625 --> 00:40:23,708
submitting FOIA requests,
congress began investigating,
none of it could happen without

426
00:40:23,708 --> 00:40:29,708
initial information on which to
go. 	But for better or worse,
this sort of break‑in is no

427
00:40:32,625 --> 00:40:38,625
longer especially viable. Indeed
there is now a need for heroes
to straight hack the FBI. And

428
00:40:42,167 --> 00:40:46,708
other intelligence agencies to
liberate the records of
government. And I want to be

429
00:40:46,708 --> 00:40:51,625
clear, there are very serious
consequences, the most serious
consequences I'm calling for

430
00:40:51,625 --> 00:40:57,500
violation of the espionage act.
Anyone who is even moderately
interested in what I'm saying,

431
00:40:57,500 --> 00:41:01,833
please take the time to think
about what we're talking about
here. What I'm talking about

432
00:41:01,833 --> 00:41:09,000
here today. Because again, these
are deeply serious issues that
we're discussing, any

433
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:14,750
administration will be deeply
antagonistic and present
administration is among the most

434
00:41:14,750 --> 00:41:20,750
radical in that regard. But in
the absence of inadequately
working FOIA or whistleblowers,

435
00:41:23,125 --> 00:41:27,667
I argue that such hacking of the
FBI and other agencies is
essential to the viability of

436
00:41:27,667 --> 00:41:34,792
American democracy. And I don't
know how to do this sort of
hacking. I don't know at all.

437
00:41:34,792 --> 00:41:40,792
I'm an historian not a
technologist. Fortunately,
however, this is perhaps among

438
00:41:45,208 --> 00:41:49,917
the best rooms on the planet to
be having this discussion. Not
including the FBI agents here to

439
00:41:49,917 --> 00:41:55,042
spy on us and the NSA agents
here to recruit you to spy for
them, those in this room possess

440
00:41:55,042 --> 00:42:00,958
the incredibly rare combination
of Ninja technical skills and
radical liberation politics to

441
00:42:00,958 --> 00:42:06,917
make such an endeavor possible.
It's not surprising those in
power wish to keep their acts in

442
00:42:06,917 --> 00:42:13,333
secret. What is surprising how
readily we tolerate it. I'll say
it again. The records of

443
00:42:13,333 --> 00:42:19,333
government are the property of
the people. Reclaim them. Hack
the FBI. Thank you. [Applause]

444
00:42:47,875 --> 00:42:53,792
>> Can you provide any specific
details about how you expanded
your search methodology to fill

445
00:42:53,792 --> 00:42:59,792
in or map the gaps, do anything
more refined? >> Are you asking
about how I figured out the gaps

446
00:43:03,333 --> 00:43:09,250
or what the gaps themselves
actually are? >> Like how you
chose your search terms

447
00:43:09,250 --> 00:43:15,250
basically to figure out what the
gaps were. >> Sure. Absolutely.
There are an unknowably large

448
00:43:17,833 --> 00:43:21,750
number of things that the FBI
does to avoid compliance this is
only going to speak to some of

449
00:43:21,750 --> 00:43:29,042
them. And the FBI is changing it
all the time once people figure
out what is going on. But, sure,

450
00:43:29,042 --> 00:43:34,500
what I'm talking about now again
is about how to understand FBI
non‑compliance with the Freedom

451
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:41,125
of Information Act and how I
went about figuring out what
that was. So well, for example,

452
00:43:41,125 --> 00:43:45,125
let's start with this. When one
gets a letter from the FBI, like
that letter that I showed you

453
00:43:45,125 --> 00:43:50,250
earlier that said we don't have
any records on you. I should
mention that I already have some

454
00:43:50,250 --> 00:43:57,542
hundreds of pages on me now,
they have been trying to get me
on some sort of terrorism

455
00:43:57,542 --> 00:44:03,625
charges. They won't give a few
thousand more of my pages
because of national security.

456
00:44:03,625 --> 00:44:08,708
Now, when they send you letter
saying they don't have anything,
and most people read it say they

457
00:44:08,708 --> 00:44:12,958
don't have anything that's not
what it says. What it says we
conducted a search of our

458
00:44:12,958 --> 00:44:17,125
central record system were
unable to identify named file
records responsive to your

459
00:44:17,125 --> 00:44:24,375
request. And what that actually
saying is, we conducted a search
of one database using one search

460
00:44:24,375 --> 00:44:28,542
methodology for one file type
and didn't find anything, Oops
by the way we're not going to

461
00:44:28,542 --> 00:44:34,208
mention that absolutely not the
search methodology not primarily
the file type that is likely to

462
00:44:34,208 --> 00:44:40,500
produce the request of records
and only one of many databases.
So a lot of what I was doing was

463
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:47,875
simply trying to figure out...
it's not a question of using the
right terms. They're not um, the

464
00:44:47,875 --> 00:44:51,750
problem isn't that you're not
using the right terms. The FBI
will try and say that at

465
00:44:51,750 --> 00:44:56,292
sometimes, but it's just
completely untrue. The FBI
essentially has two information

466
00:44:56,292 --> 00:45:00,667
storage and retrieval systems,
one for FOIA, one for us and one
for them. And they're very

467
00:45:00,667 --> 00:45:07,417
capable of finding the things
that they want to find. It's not
an issue of them not using the

468
00:45:07,417 --> 00:45:13,708
right terms. But because of the
way that the FBI has designed
their FOIA specific information

469
00:45:13,708 --> 00:45:19,500
storage and retrieval systems,
and by the way that design
is ...it is designed to fail.

470
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:26,750
Failure by design. How one
crafts a search is very
important, at least in theory,

471
00:45:26,750 --> 00:45:33,000
though I would recommend
submitting FOIA requests, let's
say there's a particular

472
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:38,917
individual whom you want records
and that individual is related
to an activist group and that

473
00:45:38,917 --> 00:45:44,917
activist group has a newsletter
and that activist group has been
involved in particular actions

474
00:45:44,917 --> 00:45:49,167
and those actions are against
particular targets. Submit
requests in all those things,

475
00:45:49,167 --> 00:45:55,167
all of the things, request all
the things. And certainly one
needs to... the problem is, most

476
00:45:57,750 --> 00:46:05,083
people's FOIA requests are a
page in length. Mine are usually
30 pages long to the FBI, search

477
00:46:05,083 --> 00:46:09,042
this database like this, search
this database like use this
search methodology, search for

478
00:46:09,042 --> 00:46:13,542
this file type like this.
However, again the problem isn't
that you're not doing it right.

479
00:46:13,542 --> 00:46:18,625
One really should be able to
submit one‑page FOIA request.
And get what you're looking for.

480
00:46:18,625 --> 00:46:25,417
The problem is that the FBI is
operating in straight forward
bad faith. And so you can word

481
00:46:25,417 --> 00:46:29,083
your request however you want,
you can request however you want
occasionally you might get a

482
00:46:29,083 --> 00:46:34,333
hit. But the bottom line that
FOIA requests for the FBI
shouldn't be written for the

483
00:46:34,333 --> 00:46:38,875
FBI. This isn't the case of all
agencies, with the FBI and
successful FOIA work almost

484
00:46:38,875 --> 00:46:43,333
invariably requires litigation,
the FBI simply is not going to
do their job, they're not going

485
00:46:43,333 --> 00:46:46,875
to comply to the law, there is
no teeth to the law, and they
don't want to comply. so why

486
00:46:46,875 --> 00:46:53,792
should they. The worst case
scenario that you sue in which
case, you know, they don't lose

487
00:46:53,792 --> 00:46:57,167
anything other than what they
would have given you you know,
what they would have given you

488
00:46:57,167 --> 00:47:02,208
without the suit. Unfortunately
successful FOIA work with the
FBI frequently requires

489
00:47:02,208 --> 00:47:06,375
litigation. FOIA requests to the
FBI ultimately should be written
for the judge. Lots of ways to

490
00:47:06,375 --> 00:47:10,833
craft a request such that you
have more to work with when
you're before a judge. The FBI

491
00:47:10,833 --> 00:47:15,958
should have done this, this and
this because they had this
information. But unfortunately

492
00:47:15,958 --> 00:47:20,917
that there are no penalties nor
non‑compliance means the FBI can
thumb their nose at requesters

493
00:47:20,917 --> 00:47:26,917
until one sues. Other questions?
>> Hey. Ryan, loved your work
for a long time, thanks for the

494
00:47:31,125 --> 00:47:37,125
talk. I've been looking for ward
to it for a long time. If you
haven't been to Ronald's they

495
00:47:40,542 --> 00:47:45,083
have awesome vegan doughnuts
that's all I had to say. >>
Awesome man, thank you, I look

496
00:47:45,083 --> 00:47:51,500
forward to that, appreciate it.
>> Ryan, Hey. So you're a pretty
smart guy. I understand the

497
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:58,125
issue about Pandora's box about
the warning... my question is,
in regards to hacking and

498
00:47:58,125 --> 00:48:04,583
reverse engineering lot of smart
people in regards to this issue
who have been made aware of, to

499
00:48:04,583 --> 00:48:08,417
clarify that even the
information that you're
requesting you don't even know

500
00:48:08,417 --> 00:48:13,958
if it's the right information
that you're going to receive
thus the ability for them to

501
00:48:13,958 --> 00:48:18,750
alter or change or modify the
information that you request.
How do you go through that

502
00:48:18,750 --> 00:48:25,042
process of knowing that what
you're receiving or hope to get
not even the information that

503
00:48:25,042 --> 00:48:30,583
you know whether or not it's
correct. >> That's a great
question. As you're pointing out

504
00:48:30,583 --> 00:48:35,250
they hold most of the cards,
they hold all the documents,
people who search for documents.

505
00:48:35,250 --> 00:48:41,042
Ideally if you get it before the
court you can get the documents
before the judge but the FBI has

506
00:48:41,042 --> 00:48:46,542
to bring the documents before
the judge. I'm working with the
tools that I have, how do I deal

507
00:48:46,542 --> 00:48:51,583
with it. I don't know best that
I can. I sue them left and
right. I stay on it. I submit

508
00:48:51,583 --> 00:48:56,375
hundreds and hundreds ever
requests, try to... there's not
a good answer other than the one

509
00:48:56,375 --> 00:49:04,333
that I'm advocating here. Hack
the FBI. Let's find out. Then we
had question from over here.

510
00:49:04,333 --> 00:49:08,417
What changes would I make to the
Freedom of Information Act is
that essentially the question?

511
00:49:11,125 --> 00:49:15,833
Sure. EFF is doing great here,
the national security archive
doing great work, number of

512
00:49:15,833 --> 00:49:23,667
of ‑‑ there's number of
excellent groups. And right now
revisions that are being

513
00:49:23,667 --> 00:49:29,667
proposed dealing with exemption
if that's a key one. Clarifying
the fee waiver language. This is

514
00:49:34,792 --> 00:49:40,292
critical. There are innumerable
fixes that could be made. Number
one most important fix from my

515
00:49:40,292 --> 00:49:46,292
perspective is penalties for
non‑compliance. Some incentive
for an agency to not completely

516
00:49:48,750 --> 00:49:54,750
flout federal law because they
feel like it. Any last
questions? >> By your

517
00:49:58,042 --> 00:50:04,208
description the Freedom of
Information Act request you're
making are pretty specific do

518
00:50:04,208 --> 00:50:09,500
you make those available in
archives so that people
basically can use your work? >>

519
00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:14,458
Do I make the results or the
requests themselves? >> The
requests including the language

520
00:50:14,458 --> 00:50:20,708
of the requests. >> I don't have
that available in archive, it is
constantly changing based on the

521
00:50:20,708 --> 00:50:27,250
FBI's changes and what I learn.
But it's something that I am
happy to discuss with someone,

522
00:50:27,250 --> 00:50:34,667
with people on an individual
level. Yeah. >> Thanks. And I
think that's all the time that

523
00:50:34,667 --> 00:50:39,500
we have. Thank you so much for
coming. [Applause] "This text is
