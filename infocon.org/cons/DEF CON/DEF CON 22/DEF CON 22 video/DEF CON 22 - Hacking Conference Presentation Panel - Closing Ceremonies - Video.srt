1
00:00:00,917 --> 00:00:06,917
>> Hello, DEF CON.  	>>
[Applause].  	>> So I've got to
tell you, this was an amazingly

2
00:00:15,208 --> 00:00:20,750
fast year for me. It feels like
we just opened this in Penn and
Teller and now we're sitting in

3
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:25,375
a room across the hotel and I'm
telling you goodbye. I'm going
to cry.  	>> Don't cry.  	>>

4
00:00:25,375 --> 00:00:32,292
Since we have so many more
people in the room and I can
actually sort of see everybody,

5
00:00:32,292 --> 00:00:39,958
can you raise your hand if this
is your first year please?  	>>
[Applause].  	>> All right, big

6
00:00:39,958 --> 00:00:46,250
hand for yourself.  	>>
[Applause].  	>> All right, for
everyone else, I promise you we

7
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:53,958
will try to make this as short
and painless as possible.  	>>
[Laughter].  	>> [Applause].

8
00:00:53,958 --> 00:01:00,792
 	>> So in the interest of time
savings, I am going to move on
to my thank yous. My name is

9
00:01:00,792 --> 00:01:06,792
Russ and I am the Acting Chief
of Operations for the conference
this year.  	>> [Cheering].  	>>

10
00:01:09,208 --> 00:01:15,208
Thank you, Banchi. There was an
absence, I want to make a shout
out Locki, so if I could get a

11
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:24,500
shout out to Lock.  	>>
[Applause].  	>> This is his
first DEF CON to miss in 20

12
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:33,250
years. So, yeah, this is a
pretty big deal  	>> [Off mic].
 	>> Oh, sure, now you won't say

13
00:01:37,208 --> 00:01:43,208
anything. Chicken! First I want
to say, my voice is my passport.
 	>> Yeah!  	>> Thank you.

14
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:57,500
[Laughter]. Some people got it.
 	>> [Laughter].  	>> So we have
a lot of people that make this

15
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:02,958
conference happen. You know, if
you've been here for any amount
of time, you can remember back

16
00:02:02,958 --> 00:02:08,750
when we counted ourselves in
hundreds or less and not in tens
of thousands. So it takes a

17
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:14,542
strong intelligent and proactive
team to make this happen. So I
can't mention all of the names,

18
00:02:14,542 --> 00:02:19,333
so I will apologize now, but I
do want to mention the people
and the groups that make this

19
00:02:19,333 --> 00:02:27,000
happen. So from Administration,
we've got Nikita, Neal, Romer
and Will and Lost Boy. So I

20
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
would like to get a round of
applause for them.  	>>
[Applause].  	>> On the

21
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:35,000
production team, we have Cheryl,
Tom and a whole slew of people
running around making sure the

22
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:51,583
trash is emptied of the trash
thrown away. You guys throw some
crazy stuff away, I don't know

23
00:02:51,583 --> 00:02:57,583
where you get some of this
stuff. Round of applause for
production team, please.  	>>

24
00:02:57,583 --> 00:03:03,583
[Applause].  	>> So for the rest
of this, I'm just going to kind
of read everything off and we

25
00:03:07,792 --> 00:03:11,792
can applaud everyone at the end
because I've got about 15 groups
and I just realized it's going

26
00:03:11,792 --> 00:03:17,208
to take me about a half hour if
we do in this way. Thank you.
 	>> [Laughter].  	>> So for

27
00:03:17,208 --> 00:03:24,375
registration, we've got C Stone
and his team, for speakers, we
have Agent X and his team.  	>>

28
00:03:24,375 --> 00:03:30,375
Whoa!  	>>	For Swag, we have
Secret and his team. For the Red
Shirts, we have CJ, Flea and

29
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:37,625
their team and I would also like
to shout out to Priest who has
helped me on more than one

30
00:03:37,625 --> 00:03:45,292
occasion this weekend put out
some fires. Contests, we have
Hack a Jar and Coleslaw is. For

31
00:03:45,292 --> 00:03:51,292
villages and parties we have
Drifter.  	>> Whoa!  	>> For QM
we have Major and we have Tom

32
00:03:54,500 --> 00:04:00,500
and I think there's a song about
that. For radios we have
[indiscernible]. For dispatch,

33
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:11,542
we have Heather and her team.
For the Knock, we have Effen and
his team. For the press we have

34
00:04:11,542 --> 00:04:19,500
Nicole and team. For vendors, we
have Wisacker and all the people
who helped him out. I also want

35
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:27,000
to thank [indiscernible] and the
rest of his team for putting on
a great DC 101 this year. And

36
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,208
for everybody else that I did
not mention that is on staff,
I'd like to say thank you. For

37
00:04:31,208 --> 00:04:37,458
my first why year to every
actually step up and be the man
in the hot seat, you made it

38
00:04:37,458 --> 00:04:42,875
easy. And mostly I want to thank
every single one of you, we do
this because we were in your

39
00:04:42,875 --> 00:04:48,875
seat once and we freakin' love
DEF CON. So thank you all for
being here.  	>> [Applause].

40
00:04:54,417 --> 00:05:00,417
 	>> All right, I have one more
item of business and then I'll
hand it off to DT. Where is Eddy

41
00:05:03,958 --> 00:05:09,958
Mise? So Eddy Mise did all of
the faces of death? How many of
you saw faces of death? Faces of

42
00:05:14,542 --> 00:05:20,542
DEF CON.  	>> Drink!  	>> All I
have a water sorry. Hey, I've
been sober no the weekend

43
00:05:23,792 --> 00:05:29,792
mostly. So he did a whole bunch
of artwork and they have gone
through the trouble of having a

44
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:38,958
whole ton of us sign this and
this was under the guise of
donating this for Hackers For

45
00:05:38,958 --> 00:05:44,958
Fundraising, but we have all
signed this for Eddy as a thank
you, so if we could get a round

46
00:05:48,167 --> 00:05:54,167
of applause.  	>> [Applause]
 	>> I don't know what to say
about that, you guys are all

47
00:06:05,417 --> 00:06:11,417
incredible, Russ, all of you,
thank you so much  	>>
[Applause].  	>> And so with

48
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:20,750
that, I'm going to hand it to
the Dark Tangent. Yeah!  	>>
[Applause] whoa!  	>> Now I want

49
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:28,000
to just echo what Russ has said,
this is a team sport right up
here and these are some of the

50
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:34,458
team players, but we have about
300 volunteers, not counting
just attendees that do it

51
00:06:34,458 --> 00:06:39,375
themselves and make stuff
happen. And somebody came up to
me just before the start and he

52
00:06:39,375 --> 00:06:44,083
said, you know what, this is my
third DEF CON and the first one
I went to, I don't know what to

53
00:06:44,083 --> 00:06:48,250
do and I was really kind of
anti‑ social. And the second one
I started to get the vibe, but

54
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:54,875
yesterday I was dancing and
partying and my wallet fell out
and I lost it. An hour later a

55
00:06:54,875 --> 00:07:00,875
dude called me and he had it. He
said this is the best community,
this is super cool.  	>>

56
00:07:13,167 --> 00:07:18,125
[Applause].  	>> So that's the
spirit we're really trying to
build here. A couple of things I

57
00:07:18,125 --> 00:07:25,542
want to mention for next year.
Hey, that was me, I was supposed
to shoot those at you! So some

58
00:07:25,542 --> 00:07:29,875
statistics, this year ‑ ‑ a
couple years ago you guys might
have noticed I did a media

59
00:07:29,875 --> 00:07:35,667
server and this year it turned
into an engineering problem, how
do we get data to you so

60
00:07:35,667 --> 00:07:41,708
quickly, you are not downloading
all CON long, so we bought these
duplicators and next year we

61
00:07:41,708 --> 00:07:47,042
will have a duplication village.
And we served up 4
[indiscernible] of hard drives

62
00:07:47,042 --> 00:07:53,042
and we could have done more, but
three fails. 3% fail your on
disks and the number one culprit

63
00:07:56,667 --> 00:08:04,417
tending to be Western Digital
Green Drive. Be careful if you
are using those, they might not

64
00:08:04,417 --> 00:08:09,792
last very long. I want to call
up a couple of people that have
run some services and I'll let

65
00:08:09,792 --> 00:08:14,792
them step through some slides
and let you know what's going
on. First up, I want you to get

66
00:08:14,792 --> 00:08:22,083
Effen ready. Effen is the man
and he put together some
statistics for us.  	>> I'm

67
00:08:22,083 --> 00:08:28,083
sorry, we have a little
tradition here at DEF CON. We
with have been thanking first

68
00:08:30,417 --> 00:08:35,125
time speakers all weekend long,
I think we need to thank the
first time attendees. So

69
00:08:35,125 --> 00:08:41,125
[indiscernible] if you could
come up here, a shot for the
first time attendees.  	>>

70
00:08:44,042 --> 00:08:47,542
[Applause].  	>> Back on?  	>>
Hello.  	>> Still alive? So
let's do this really quick for

71
00:08:47,542 --> 00:08:53,542
the sake of time, we're going to
make these slides available on
DEFCON.networking.com. What we

72
00:09:11,417 --> 00:09:13,417
do is wired infrastructure and
wireless for the
[indiscernible], they are able

73
00:09:13,417 --> 00:09:15,417
to make [indiscernible]. What's
different from last year? We got
more gigabits. So we did some

74
00:09:15,417 --> 00:09:21,417
upgrades and thank
[indiscernible] for doing most
of this. We got a new firewall,

75
00:09:41,833 --> 00:09:47,833
and you can read all of this,
the wireless gear we got some
new modules for the controller

76
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,667
that we have, and a media server
that DT brought was really
awesome and he's going to talk

77
00:09:54,667 --> 00:10:00,667
more about that, right?  	>>
Yeah.  	>> So I'll leave it for
him. And, of course, Rich as

78
00:10:02,833 --> 00:10:08,292
well. So for the first time,
we're going to actually see the
network topography of DEF CON.

79
00:10:08,292 --> 00:10:14,000
 	>> [Laughter].  	>> So the
airplane is the network and you
guys are around it, right? We

80
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:20,000
have some good attendees and
some not good ones. At the end
of the day, it's a freaking

81
00:10:22,042 --> 00:10:28,792
hacking conference, right?  	>>
[Laughter].  	>> So that's what
we do all week and tonight or

82
00:10:28,792 --> 00:10:36,333
today we feel kind of like this.
But it sort of worked for the
most part, as far as we know. So

83
00:10:36,333 --> 00:10:42,208
some challenges that we usually
have and we change every year,
this year was again IOS devices

84
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:47,042
with [indiscernible] access
certificates, that's why it took
us a little why to put the Wi‑

85
00:10:47,042 --> 00:10:52,000
Fi server there because we want
to make it easier for you guys.
I'll put some notes on the

86
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,583
slides later. And there's never
enough time. Wednesday night we
planned to go to dinner and we

87
00:10:56,583 --> 00:11:03,667
were like, you know, dinner is
going to be off. So that's how
it is. During the conference,

88
00:11:03,667 --> 00:11:09,667
some of the devices were not
really behaving like they
should. Unplugged APs and all

89
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:19,667
that good stuff. Some is of the
steps, that's what people like
to see, so we have 120 megabits

90
00:11:19,667 --> 00:11:27,208
uplinked to the Internet. We
reached, I think, about 100, so
it's not too bad. But the

91
00:11:27,208 --> 00:11:34,208
internal amount of data that we
transferred was way, way bigger
than the past few years. So

92
00:11:34,208 --> 00:11:40,208
congratulations to you guys for
using it. And we have 4300
devices registered, that doesn't

93
00:11:42,292 --> 00:11:48,958
mean much or doesn't mean
anything, but it's good, right?
It's a lot of stuff. Wi‑ Fi

94
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:55,667
statistics, specific to the
wireless network, we have about
50 access points, 41 access

95
00:11:55,667 --> 00:12:01,708
points providing service and
antennas and monitors, just
watching what you guys are

96
00:12:01,708 --> 00:12:09,708
doing. And we get about an
average of 600 users per hour
during CON time and hacks about

97
00:12:09,708 --> 00:12:15,708
2000 per day.  	>> [Off mic].
 	>> Trust me, I know you can.
DC TV broadcast the reel, booms.

98
00:12:22,125 --> 00:12:28,125
 	>> How many of you watched?
 	>> How many of you watched?
Pretty good. These are the drunk

99
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:36,958
people. One of the things the
video man did was played the
background documentary. This is

100
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:55,417
the knock team, I'm not going to
list any one, we have the old
timers and four new that helped

101
00:12:55,417 --> 00:13:01,292
with everything, including get
drunk in the off hours that they
didn't work. And I want to thank

102
00:13:01,292 --> 00:13:09,000
every here, I want to thank
Will, Cheryl, who was on every
single e‑ mail we sent to

103
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:15,000
everyone, Cesar, On‑ Core, the
one random guy that drops snacks
for us and we get feedback

104
00:13:21,708 --> 00:13:28,875
during the conference and some
of them are very constructive.
So this is how you get the

105
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:34,875
slides later. This is the e‑
mail to send the feedback. And
that's it. Thank you.  	>>

106
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,208
Thanks everyone.  	>>
[Applause].  	>> Okay, this year
we have a new contest called PD

107
00:13:41,208 --> 00:13:46,792
Francis X hour film that long
time Dune Waz put on and we're
going to show you the winner, so

108
00:13:46,792 --> 00:13:52,417
Waz, take it away.  	>> Hello.
That person has had too much to
drink.  	>> [Laughter].  	>>

109
00:13:52,417 --> 00:13:58,417
First off, it was a team effort,
my buddy, I don't drive cars,
yes, that's his handle, I guess

110
00:14:03,833 --> 00:14:09,833
he didn't drive cars, but he's
supposed to be walking up here
right now as well. So he's not

111
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:31,542
here. Anyway, okay, so this is
the first year of what we hope
will be a multi-year project

112
00:14:31,542 --> 00:14:38,792
that PD Francis X hour film
contest. It is a 5 minute film
contest. This year the attendees

113
00:14:38,792 --> 00:14:44,792
or the registration teams fill
up, register, they have 48 hours
to make a 5 minute film from the

114
00:14:47,458 --> 00:14:54,250
time they register. This year's
genre was science fiction. We
had 7 teams registered. Four of

115
00:14:54,250 --> 00:15:00,250
them provided awesome, awesome
entries. We even had two
celebrity judges. Crap, where

116
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:08,500
are my glasses? I can't see.
 	>> [Off mic].  	>> Do you want
to plug in here?  	>> So we had

117
00:15:13,125 --> 00:15:19,125
Willy Nubank and Brian
Nappenburger who directed the
[indiscernible] and the Internet

118
00:15:23,125 --> 00:15:29,125
boy that was played this
weekend.  	>> Where is the thing
that I click with? Thank you.

119
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Okay, so ‑ ‑ great, and the
winner is, after we tell you
what ‑ ‑ okay, great. This is

120
00:15:46,667 --> 00:15:52,667
exactly ‑ ‑ .  	>> [Laughter].
 	>> This is exactly the way we
rehearsed this.  	>> [Off mic].

121
00:15:56,875 --> 00:16:02,875
 	>> Try turning it off and on
again!  	>> [Laughter].  	>>
[Cheering].  	>> So, here you

122
00:16:18,583 --> 00:16:24,667
read it. You get to read them
then.  	>> Okay.  	>> Go ahead.
 	>> The [indiscernible] on our

123
00:16:24,667 --> 00:16:29,292
celebrity Director that is going
to announce the winner is messed
up, so we're going to dub.  	>>

124
00:16:29,292 --> 00:16:35,292
My name is Brian Nappenburger
and I'm a writer and Director ‑
‑ .  	>> Oh.  	>> It's playing

125
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:45,500
in the background still.	 	>>
VIDEO: To choose a winner.  	>>
There it is, all right, I'm

126
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:48,917
going to start it back at the
beginning.	 	>> VIDEO: Hi, I am
Brian Nappenburger

127
00:16:48,917 --> 00:16:56,458
[indiscernible] and it's pretty
[indiscernible] here. This year
7 teams [indiscernible] it was

128
00:16:56,458 --> 00:16:59,583
tough to choose a winner, but
one definitely stood out
[indiscernible] just an in

129
00:16:59,583 --> 00:17:05,583
depth, massively [indiscernible]
special effects. The winner of
this year's [indiscernible] is

130
00:17:43,375 --> 00:17:49,375
[indiscernible].  	>> [Cheering]
 	>> VIDEO: [Indiscernible].
 	>> [Laughter].  	>> VIDEO:

131
00:19:08,875 --> 00:19:14,875
[Indiscernible]. [Laughter].
[Music]. [Cheering]  	>>
Unfortunately, the winning team

132
00:19:25,958 --> 00:19:31,958
could not ‑ ‑ Uber Lab could not
make it. Everybody say bye.  	>>
Sign up next year!  	>>

133
00:19:53,042 --> 00:19:59,042
Everybody sign up next year,
please!  	>> That went really
smoothly. All right.  	>>

134
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:12,458
[Laughter].  	>> So we need I‑
Hat Charities who is going to
talk about this. Where are you,

135
00:20:12,458 --> 00:20:18,458
Stealth?  	>> Come on up here.
What are you doing over there?
 	>> Okay, what do I do now? Oh,

136
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:30,250
yeah, I do my thing, okay.  	>>
Hello, DEF CON.  	>> Hello!  	>>
Okay, well, let's see, we're all

137
00:20:33,792 --> 00:20:38,708
having a good time now. You
know, I've been involved in the
fundraising here for some time

138
00:20:38,708 --> 00:20:44,542
and it just ‑ ‑ .  	>> [Off
mic].  	>> Do I have slides?
 	>> [Off mic].  	>> Those are

139
00:20:44,542 --> 00:20:48,958
somebody else's numbers. Those
are somebody else's numbers.
Yeah. Anyway, I've been involved

140
00:20:48,958 --> 00:20:56,125
with this a long time and it
continuously amazing me of our
community here how willing they

141
00:20:56,125 --> 00:21:01,833
are to help and share with
others and whether it's
returning a lost wallet or

142
00:21:01,833 --> 00:21:07,708
giving blood, you all continue
to excel and exceed everyone's
expectation. There are many

143
00:21:07,708 --> 00:21:13,708
charity, large and small, and
one of the charities was a
hackers space called Den Met,

144
00:21:17,667 --> 00:21:23,792
and with the help of Mohawk,
they were able to raise
[indiscernible] and we think

145
00:21:23,792 --> 00:21:29,792
that is great for them, help
them get off the ground.  	>>
[Applause].  	>> Now I know it's

146
00:21:38,125 --> 00:21:43,458
a long way from here, but
probably some of you know where
Uganda is on the map, it's a

147
00:21:43,458 --> 00:21:48,458
developing country and people
there need a lot of help. And
back in 2007, John and Jen Long

148
00:21:48,458 --> 00:21:54,458
started a nonprofit for them,
they are working with lots of
people, thousands of students

149
00:22:00,125 --> 00:22:04,708
are being trained by them on
computers and computer
application to prepare them for

150
00:22:04,708 --> 00:22:08,750
the future. And the future is
coming soon for them because
Google is considering wiring

151
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:15,333
their capital with fiber and we
are trying to give them those
skills. One was raised and I

152
00:22:15,333 --> 00:22:21,333
would like to name them. Gamers
for a Good Cause gave $45.
Mohawks have raised $820 for the

153
00:22:30,917 --> 00:22:36,917
cause.  	>> [Applause].  	>>
There's no doubt that Eddy Mise
is a pillar in our community, I

154
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:48,667
guess that's the best I can put
it because Eddy has raised
$4,100 for the Hackers for

155
00:22:48,667 --> 00:22:54,667
Charity cause this year. That
brings us to total of $5,900.59.
But wait, that's not all, at the

156
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:05,750
Hackers for Charity booth, you
guys really came out and they
raised $27,633. Thank you DEF

157
00:23:08,625 --> 00:23:14,625
CON! Thank you all!  	>>
[Applause].  	>> Now we're going
to move on to [indiscernible] to

158
00:23:22,958 --> 00:23:29,208
make it a little more stream
time since there's a lot of
people to do stuff. So we'll

159
00:23:29,208 --> 00:23:36,625
start out with everybody else
besides the big fundraiser, Hack
purchased $4,500, Mohawk

160
00:23:36,625 --> 00:23:41,708
[indiscernible], it's pretty
amazing. 4220, these were not
fully tallied yet. Info booth,

161
00:23:50,208 --> 00:23:56,208
Eddy that's wrong $4,100 for
Eddy, half of that he raised to
charities and DC Dark Net by

162
00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:05,250
selling the badges, another
3,000, is that it? Yep. And now
we'll move on to one more for a

163
00:24:07,667 --> 00:24:13,667
subtotal of $15,933 for EFF.
But, wait, there's more! The
Summit, at the door we raised

164
00:24:21,625 --> 00:24:27,625
$19,770. $2,579 in auction
items, cash, there were a lot of
credit charges, $720 cash for

165
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:36,500
the raffle, $13,000 in VIP
presales. $2,500 in general
sales, credit cards where it was

166
00:24:39,667 --> 00:24:45,667
the door auction or something
else, $9,075 for an in‑ room
total of $48,000 plus the EFF

167
00:24:48,250 --> 00:24:54,250
booth raised another 10,000, for
a grand total of $58,000 raised
just in four hours.  	>>

168
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:13,000
[Applause].  	>> So we want to
point out that was a Thursday
night party hosted by Vegas 2.0.

169
00:25:17,625 --> 00:25:24,042
If you tack this extra $58,000
on that, you can do the math, we
raised a ton of money over the

170
00:25:24,042 --> 00:25:30,042
last $10 years. So far we have a
grand total of $64,284 plus
their own booth donations of

171
00:25:42,083 --> 00:25:49,917
$58,711, so we broke last year's
record of is hundred thousand by
about $14,000. Thank you so much

172
00:25:49,917 --> 00:25:57,917
for your contributions to the
foundation. And here from the
electronic fund [indiscernible]

173
00:25:57,917 --> 00:26:03,917
foundation is Kirk to receive
you.  	>> Thank you, thank you,
thank you, it's so great to be

174
00:26:07,167 --> 00:26:11,292
back among this community here.
Your support from the
individuals who came up to

175
00:26:11,292 --> 00:26:17,500
become members to all of the
wonderful people who found
creative ways to raise money for

176
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:22,750
us, it's the support from this
community that really helps us
keep going and you are helping

177
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:27,458
us defend the Internet, defend
the hacker community, and we
can't thank you enough, so thank

178
00:26:27,458 --> 00:26:33,458
you, thank you, thank you.  	>>
[Applause].  	>> Already, Blood
Code.  	>> Come on down.  	>>

179
00:26:39,625 --> 00:26:45,625
You have to move faster than
that. We're going to cut off
your hugs.  	>> I need a hug!

180
00:26:50,292 --> 00:26:56,292
 	>> [Laughter].  	>> Hello,
thank you very much! Oh, yay!
 	>> [Cheering].  	>> That's not

181
00:26:59,042 --> 00:27:05,042
the first time it's happened,
but it's one of the best. Thank
you DEF CON for being a great

182
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:13,542
community and turning out and
helping with Blood Code. I have
bad news, we only have 90 units

183
00:27:13,542 --> 00:27:21,208
this year, no way to pussy foot
around on that one. I do know I
talked to DT recently and we're

184
00:27:21,208 --> 00:27:27,208
going to be creating a bleeding
edge track next year where we're
going to have volunteer speakers

185
00:27:29,458 --> 00:27:35,458
come out, it will be interactive
entertainment so you will bleed
and you will be entertained. You

186
00:27:40,333 --> 00:27:45,875
will learn while you bleed, so
that should help. I'm not going
to take up too much more of your

187
00:27:45,875 --> 00:27:51,875
time, but I think it's
important, Julie, who could not
be here, she runs the blood

188
00:27:54,208 --> 00:28:00,917
donation, she had some new
timers saying why are we having
a blood drive? Who is this blood

189
00:28:00,917 --> 00:28:06,917
person and what is that about?
The key thing is we're having a
blood drive because it helps.

190
00:28:12,417 --> 00:28:17,375
Hackers aren't just about fixes
computers. We're supposed to be
fixes everything we see wrong

191
00:28:17,375 --> 00:28:21,625
with something and that's what
it's about. It's trying to do
something good. It's trying to

192
00:28:21,625 --> 00:28:26,792
show a positive impact. It's
showing people that don't know
maybe how to hack an airplane or

193
00:28:26,792 --> 00:28:31,750
hacking something like that, but
they are seeing good things come
out of this conference and one

194
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:36,250
of those things is they are
helping people that they are
never going to see live by

195
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:40,750
donating blood. And that is a
beautiful thing and that's one
of the things we should be

196
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:45,333
showing our community and what
we do. Thank you DEF CON for
hosting that. Thank you for

197
00:28:45,333 --> 00:28:50,875
being so supportive. And thank
you guys for actually bleeding
for the cause.  	>> [Applause].

198
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,750
 	>> All right, hi, everybody.
Over in the sound theater,
separate from all of you crazy

199
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:10,750
people, we ran Rootz Asylum
where I is a nonprofit we teach
kids 8 to 16 how to be hackers.

200
00:29:15,042 --> 00:29:21,042
This year we had 400 attendees,
kids and their parents. So
record number again.  	>>

201
00:29:24,125 --> 00:29:29,958
[Applause].  	>> And what's a
little different about the kids
event besides they are smaller

202
00:29:29,958 --> 00:29:35,958
and sweeter, it's about 50%
girls.  	>> [Cheering]
[applause]  	>> Which is really

203
00:29:38,375 --> 00:29:44,375
great to see. So what we try to
do is bring in the most famous
hackers in the world to teach

204
00:29:47,042 --> 00:29:51,875
the kids. This year we had 30
presentation. Some of my
favorites were [indiscernible]

205
00:29:51,875 --> 00:29:58,625
and Howard taught the kids how
to elevator hack. Thomas Cross
taught all the kids how to break

206
00:29:58,625 --> 00:30:04,625
into [indiscernible] machines.
Charlie Miller taught us how to
hack airplanes. Teresa, princess

207
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,083
security at Google actually
donated 300 phone books for
every single kid. She taught

208
00:30:19,083 --> 00:30:25,083
them how to pone them.  	>>
[Applause].  	>> I'm always
looking for more kids' speaker,

209
00:30:27,375 --> 00:30:33,375
so if you have kids that have
some amazing research, please
have them reach out to us on the

210
00:30:38,417 --> 00:30:45,542
website, rootz.org. This year we
had to kids that presented.
[Indiscernible] taught kids how

211
00:30:45,542 --> 00:30:51,542
to do metaswipe. And muffin boy
talked about White House
hacking. We also have lock

212
00:30:53,833 --> 00:30:59,833
picking, name that VLC, code
breaking, hacker Jeopardy and
landsmithing. We have a lot

213
00:31:06,625 --> 00:31:12,625
adults come and they want to see
what's going on. So what we have
actually done is launched roots

214
00:31:26,708 --> 00:31:32,000
TV so you can find us on
YouTube, so all of you here can
see what we have been up to.

215
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:38,917
Thanks so much.  	>> [Applause].
 	>> All right, just an
interesting note, I wanted to

216
00:31:38,917 --> 00:31:44,917
tell you, we kind of can compile
the statistics of how much time
we have put into this show just

217
00:31:48,125 --> 00:31:54,000
on‑ site and if one person in
the audience were to work full‑
time as much time as all the

218
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:58,375
staff on DEF CON worked, you
would be working full‑ time for
four years just to make this

219
00:31:58,375 --> 00:32:04,250
happen. So I'd like to get
[indiscernible] coleslaw up here
for the black badge event for

220
00:32:04,250 --> 00:32:10,250
contest.  	>> [Applause].  	>>
So for those of you who don't
know, black badges gets you into

221
00:32:15,958 --> 00:32:23,500
DEF CON for life. And we've done
sort of a reboot this year for a
couple of reasons. So contests

222
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:29,500
historically have gotten black
badges aren't and contests that
haven't are. So what we're doing

223
00:32:32,208 --> 00:32:37,000
is creating a black badge hall
of fame and going back into our
history because we are moving so

224
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:42,000
fast, just like everything else,
we are not capturing our
history. We are going back and

225
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:48,667
figuring every person that got a
black badge, what team they were
on and trying to create a hall

226
00:32:48,667 --> 00:32:55,833
of fame for them. And we're
trying to be better about the
amount of effort you have to put

227
00:32:55,833 --> 00:33:03,417
in to get a black badge. So to
keep everyone on their toes, no
contest new who was going to be

228
00:33:03,417 --> 00:33:09,500
a black badge event except for
Capture the Flag. A lot of these
people didn't know the so the

229
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:16,500
contests were working extra hard
to make it challenging and a
really good game. A lot of teams

230
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:22,500
stepped up. Hackers R Us is
going to go through the teams
and name the teams who have

231
00:33:28,125 --> 00:33:31,875
received entry for life.  	>>
Coleslaw and I have been working
really hard all CON long, we had

232
00:33:31,875 --> 00:33:34,750
to make sure everything was well
oiled and all of the things
related to contests were going,

233
00:33:34,750 --> 00:33:39,833
we kind of had to spy on every
single team and see if they are
really bringing it as contest

234
00:33:39,833 --> 00:33:45,833
organizers and are they bringing
it as contestants. So it's a lot
of hard work between the two of

235
00:33:52,417 --> 00:33:58,417
us. I'll let [indiscernible]
introduce the first contest
team.  	>> All right, and before

236
00:34:04,458 --> 00:34:09,583
I introduce the first contest, I
would just like to say thank you
to the FTC for coming out and

237
00:34:09,583 --> 00:34:13,167
doing the [indiscernible]
hacking contest. How many heard
about that or participated?  	>>

238
00:34:13,167 --> 00:34:19,167
[Applause]  	>> For those who
are not aware, the purpose of
the contest was to help

239
00:34:21,417 --> 00:34:27,000
eliminate the annoying callers.
So thank you, thank you, thank
you FTC people, I think they are

240
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:33,167
upfront, so let's give them a
hand real quick.  	>>
[Applause].  	>> It's nice to be

241
00:34:33,167 --> 00:34:40,042
working with the Government for
once, let's say that. All right,
and without further ado, we're

242
00:34:40,042 --> 00:34:46,042
going to have the black badge.
Deviant, come on up.  	>> Hello,
hello! How many people came to

243
00:34:48,625 --> 00:34:53,458
the lock pick village?  	>>
[Applause].  	>> How many people
came to shot holes in things?

244
00:34:53,458 --> 00:34:59,458
They are both about penetration.
We ran the Black Bag contest
competition. It is a break in

245
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:09,250
and break back out kind of
contest. Every who saw it and
played it knows how much goes

246
00:35:09,250 --> 00:35:17,250
into, you know it's fun. Follow
the program. In third place, we
had Sex [indiscernible] from

247
00:35:17,250 --> 00:35:23,250
Salt Lake, Utah. 1297 points,
really excellent job, they did a
fine job. Big applause for them.

248
00:35:44,750 --> 00:35:48,083
 	>> [Applause].  	>> In second
place we had the Normative
Deviants, I guess they were out

249
00:35:48,083 --> 00:35:52,875
to garner favoritism and they
were the only team to get Jack a
computer out of the wall and

250
00:35:52,875 --> 00:35:57,208
switch the power. Big hand for
the Normative Deviants.  	>>
[Applause].  	>> But in first

251
00:35:57,208 --> 00:36:02,208
place, we had our German friends
the Strange Invaders, here they
are, big hand.  	>> [Applause].

252
00:36:02,208 --> 00:36:08,667
 	>> Over 1500 points, virtually
every single be objective, they
did the fastest time, 6 minutes

253
00:36:08,667 --> 00:36:13,833
and 50 seconds. They were
freakin' rocking in and you guys
are absolutely amazing. You're

254
00:36:13,833 --> 00:36:18,667
wonderful and we have some
wonderful things for you here.
You got your locketrons?  	>>

255
00:36:18,667 --> 00:36:24,667
Yeah.  	>> You also get this
 	>> [Applause]  	>> Thank you
so much. And it was as much fun

256
00:36:32,292 --> 00:36:36,583
as winning cannonball, but half
as illegal, so do a lock break
in.  	>> [Applause].  	>> All

257
00:36:36,583 --> 00:36:42,583
right, up next we have is
Capture the Packet.  	>> How is
it going everyone?  	>>

258
00:36:52,125 --> 00:36:59,333
[Cheering].  	>> This year we
did the packet hacking village,
what did you guys think?  	>>

259
00:36:59,333 --> 00:37:04,750
[Cheering].  	>> One of our
events was the capture the
packet event and it was chosen

260
00:37:04,750 --> 00:37:10,667
to be a black badge again this
year, we did some ridiculous
stuff again. As team

261
00:37:10,667 --> 00:37:16,667
[indiscernible] here, the first
place winner, give them a hand,
right?  	>> [Applause].  	>> So

262
00:37:20,542 --> 00:37:27,833
there was a picture of a key and
they had to decode the pins on
the key. [Laughter]. So we kind

263
00:37:27,833 --> 00:37:34,333
of mixed in a little bit of
stupidness, but we want to
congratulate them, they are

264
00:37:34,333 --> 00:37:42,208
getting a black badge for it.
And then, awesome, here we go.
And then for dark

265
00:37:42,208 --> 00:37:48,000
[indiscernible], we have hiss
packet packing village staff
badge.  	>> Excellent. Now I can

266
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:55,250
go in the room  	>> [Laughter].
 	>> Locked out [laughter].  	>>
But thank you, everyone. We're

267
00:37:55,250 --> 00:38:01,250
glad that you all enjoyed the
event. Thank you all much.  	>>
[Applause].  	>> All right. Keep

268
00:38:04,833 --> 00:38:10,542
this party going. Next up we
have DEF CON dark net project.
 	>> [Applause].  	>> Who wants

269
00:38:10,542 --> 00:38:16,542
a T‑ shirt?  	>> [Cheering]  	>>
One of the last 36 limited
edition T‑ shirts we got printed

270
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:25,500
up for the crew this year, so
enjoy this. The DEF CON dark net
project was an MMO in real life

271
00:38:31,167 --> 00:38:35,208
we set at DEF CON and instead of
talking to somebody with a
yellow question mark over his

272
00:38:35,208 --> 00:38:41,208
head who sends you on a question
to get 14 virginal rat scrotums,
we send you on things to learn

273
00:38:43,250 --> 00:38:49,250
skills, learn to you to crack
password, learn how to soldier.
It was a lot of fun. We had over

274
00:38:58,083 --> 00:39:05,208
330 people playing. 137 were
actively playing. And we have
the top three. Before I do, I

275
00:39:05,208 --> 00:39:11,208
want to thank my crew, Zero
Altitude, Flesh, Bunny, Skater,
Gator Bite, and a last minute

276
00:39:15,750 --> 00:39:21,750
addition to the crew, F9. Thank
you all so much. The other thing
that, probably the best part

277
00:39:28,625 --> 00:39:33,750
about this game that I have been
told about is the diversity of
the people who play the game. We

278
00:39:33,750 --> 00:39:38,333
have a lot of women and a lot of
children who are playing this
game. The whole point of it was

279
00:39:38,333 --> 00:39:43,333
to teach people, assuming zero
knowledge and teach you how to
do these things as opposed to

280
00:39:43,333 --> 00:39:50,500
seeing how weak you are already
are. In that way it's a unique
game. I want to thank everyone

281
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:56,500
for playing that. In third place
with 4788 points was Caspian.
Second place with 5097 place.

282
00:40:00,958 --> 00:40:06,958
And with 6590 point, we looked
to make sure he wasn't faking
it, it was Silk. Come on up

283
00:40:15,958 --> 00:40:21,958
here, Silk.  	>> [Applause].
 	>> Can I keep this? And best
yet we got $3,000 for the kits.

284
00:40:29,042 --> 00:40:34,875
We will make more next year. So
thank you very much.  	>>
[Applause].  	>> Oh, one more

285
00:40:34,875 --> 00:40:40,875
thing, one more thing. The DC
dark knight is not just at DEF
CON, you can play it online all

286
00:40:47,958 --> 00:40:53,667
year at DCdark.net.  	>> All
right, up next we have
[indiscernible] with Capture the

287
00:40:53,667 --> 00:40:59,667
Flag.  	>> Hey, how many people
waited to get into the FCCPF
room? Are books too hard to

288
00:41:03,208 --> 00:41:09,208
throw? Anybody want a book?  	>>
[Cheering]  	>> Hey, you said it
wasn't too hard. Don't be a

289
00:41:12,375 --> 00:41:18,375
wimp. So look, I've got ‑ ‑ that
was an epic fail. Okay. So ‑ ‑
book, book, book. Book.  	>>

290
00:41:25,083 --> 00:41:30,875
[Cheering].  	>> Yeah, I love
the excitement. Here we go.
Okay, dive for those. Okay,

291
00:41:30,875 --> 00:41:37,792
listen, first thing first, I've
got to thank dark tangent
because this year he turned the

292
00:41:37,792 --> 00:41:43,083
village into an actual DEF CON
track and we have 6 or 7 human
based speeches and it was

293
00:41:43,083 --> 00:41:49,333
awesome. You guys were lined up
for like 45 minutes outside, so
thank you. Thank you. And it was

294
00:41:49,333 --> 00:41:55,417
recorded. So it will be on the
DEF CON DVD, so that's awesome.
I have to mention the second

295
00:41:55,417 --> 00:42:01,417
place winners, so we have SECTF,
Nikita mentioned the thing for
kids was a DEF CON event, the

296
00:42:04,167 --> 00:42:10,167
kids rocked it. And then our
SECTF second place winners was
Grossial Engineers. Come on.

297
00:42:16,417 --> 00:42:22,417
 	>> [Applause].  	>> They got
some cool SEC stuff. I have a
minute and 40 seconds. I'm going

298
00:42:28,542 --> 00:42:34,542
to talk fast. Okay. The team
that we had, we had tag teams
that had to go in the booth at

299
00:42:36,667 --> 00:42:42,583
the same time and tag out and
things like that. And what we
had was the first team, the guy

300
00:42:42,583 --> 00:42:47,500
got sick, you know, sick at DEF
CON and he couldn't make it. So
we yanked the guy out of the

301
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:51,458
audience and we said you're
going to get in the booth and be
this woman's partner and we'll

302
00:42:51,458 --> 00:42:56,083
give you half an hour to
prepare. And they won. They
didn't just win, they beat them.

303
00:42:56,083 --> 00:43:02,083
Here's the best part. It's his
wife.  	>> [Laughter]  	>>
Smooth operator, come on up.	

304
00:43:11,292 --> 00:43:17,292
	>> [Applause].  	>> And the
best part is the black badge,
whoa!  	>> [Applause].  	>>

305
00:43:23,208 --> 00:43:29,208
That's going to be a fun ride
home, I guarantee it. Thank you,
guys, we'll see you next year.

306
00:43:44,083 --> 00:43:50,083
 	>> [Applause].  	>> All right.
Next up is open CTF.  	>>
[Applause].  	>> Hey, guys, so

307
00:43:54,083 --> 00:44:00,083
my name is Sowen and I'm part of
brand Ram Open CTF this year.
And open CTF is a Japanese style

308
00:44:02,250 --> 00:44:08,833
competition where the challenges
range from every single person
in this conference can do it to

309
00:44:08,833 --> 00:44:15,958
very, very hard challenges. We
had tons of people really
excited about this and we were

310
00:44:15,958 --> 00:44:21,292
really sad it didn't happen this
year, so we put a bunch of time,
got the contest together, and we

311
00:44:21,292 --> 00:44:27,292
had so many people wanting to
play, we ran the competition on
an modem so we had people coming

312
00:44:30,583 --> 00:44:36,583
together and soldering modems to
play with us. We had half a
dozen countries represented. Let

313
00:44:41,750 --> 00:44:47,750
me read off the scores, third
place we had an Australian team
4979 with 3700 points. We had a

314
00:44:50,708 --> 00:44:56,542
French team, their first time to
DEF CON they played,
[indiscernible] with 4200

315
00:44:56,542 --> 00:45:02,542
points. And then our winning
team, [indiscernible] 9, come on
up team, with 4900 points.  	>>

316
00:45:08,167 --> 00:45:14,167
[Applause].  	>> Souvenir is the
backbone for all of the
telephone systems used in the

317
00:45:16,542 --> 00:45:23,542
competition.  	>> [Laughter]
 	>> Thank you very much and we
welcome everyone to play open

318
00:45:23,542 --> 00:45:29,542
CTF next year.  	>> [Applause]
 	>> All right, I assure is you
folks, we're in the homestretch.

319
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:42,208
We're getting there. Another
black badge contest event here
is right here on stage, Mr. 

320
00:45:42,208 --> 00:45:48,208
Loss who talked about his
content.  	>> [Applause].  	>>
So those of you that saw the

321
00:45:54,833 --> 00:45:59,667
1057 room on the conference
floor and wondered what it was,
if you wandered in at 5:30 you

322
00:45:59,667 --> 00:46:03,917
would see people working and it
was part of the badge challenge.
How many of you saw the lanyard

323
00:46:03,917 --> 00:46:09,917
site? If you look at the back of
your lanyards, there's a symbol
with Chinese and Korean codes to

324
00:46:22,833 --> 00:46:28,833
weave together a lanyard that
drove you to website. They were
UTL curious dot codes and this

325
00:46:40,125 --> 00:46:45,458
is an example of one of the many
steps that the badge challenge
took this year. I'm humbled

326
00:46:45,458 --> 00:46:50,625
every year by the ingenuity and
the people that make it through
the badge challenge, it's a very

327
00:46:50,625 --> 00:46:56,625
difficult contest and it's very
humbling to see this. So the MFL
guys, if you can come up here as

328
00:47:00,958 --> 00:47:06,958
quickly as you can because we're
on a timeframe. Run, run, run.
These guys are the Muppet

329
00:47:10,167 --> 00:47:12,167
Liberation Fund. 	

330
00:47:13,417 --> 00:47:18,875
>>>	[Applause].  	>> Can you
guys, for like, 30 seconds, give
a quick what it's like to go

331
00:47:18,875 --> 00:47:22,583
through this? Because I think is
lot of the news don't have a
clue what you guys went through

332
00:47:22,583 --> 00:47:28,500
to do this.  	>> I can tell you
we showed up on Wednesday
evening and we just stopped, was

333
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:32,958
it yesterday morning? I'm not
sure on the days at this point.
But in 3 days, two all‑

334
00:47:32,958 --> 00:47:38,958
nighters, a bunch of guys in a
room, and our brains are still
bleeding a little bit. But we

335
00:47:42,083 --> 00:47:45,917
did it!  	>> [Off mic].  	>> I
mean, well ‑ ‑ .  	>> Anything
that was difficult?  	>> Things

336
00:47:45,917 --> 00:47:53,792
we hate you for? Well, we didn't
sleep at all. I was in the room
with a bunch of people who were,

337
00:47:53,792 --> 00:47:59,792
and yeah, that's a shout out for
everyone else who made us work
as hard as we did. My teammates

338
00:48:01,958 --> 00:48:07,500
were up in the room and they
were like, can we go to sleep
yet? And I was like, hell no.

339
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:13,458
 	>> [Laughter].  	>> We have
people on our ass, we're about
to lose. So thanks to everyone

340
00:48:13,458 --> 00:48:19,458
else who made us try as hard as
you did. See you next year.  	>>
[Laughter].  	>> [Applause].

341
00:48:25,042 --> 00:48:31,625
 	>> So an interesting side
note, while ‑ ‑ I take it upon
myself to not go to bed until

342
00:48:31,625 --> 00:48:37,208
they do, so if they decide to
continue to work, I stay with
them. I ride shotgun right

343
00:48:37,208 --> 00:48:43,625
alongside them. If you notice
the code in the program this
year and the weird numbers on

344
00:48:43,625 --> 00:48:48,417
the pages, it actually decoded
to a Google voice number, which
with I'll give to the audience

345
00:48:48,417 --> 00:48:54,500
and I'll tell why you in a
second and that is 251A secret
which called a phone that I kept

346
00:48:54,500 --> 00:49:00,375
on my personal and from
Wednesday on that phone has rung
nonstop. So I have been getting

347
00:49:00,375 --> 00:49:05,250
hundreds and hundreds of Google
voice mails and I'm going to put
them up on a website if anyone

348
00:49:05,250 --> 00:49:11,333
is interested in seeing what
crazy ass things you guys say
into a phone that you get a

349
00:49:11,333 --> 00:49:15,583
random number from a program at
a hacker conference. It's quite
interesting some of the things

350
00:49:15,583 --> 00:49:19,500
that come through. My wife was
saying some of the things were
just quite terrifying.  	>>

351
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:25,500
[Laughter].  	>> [Off mic].  	>>
Thank you.  	>> [Applause].  	>>
So one last quick thing, so

352
00:49:33,208 --> 00:49:37,750
while we were in the contest
room and they were working on
the badge challenge, the EFF guy

353
00:49:37,750 --> 00:49:42,292
said nobody has turned their
shirts and they all turned their
[indiscernible] on to that and

354
00:49:42,292 --> 00:49:49,542
we solved it in 30 minutes.
Thank you to those who competed.
Those of you that are new, I

355
00:49:49,542 --> 00:49:54,667
invite you to try your
hand. There's a varying degree
of difficulty. Welcome to DEF

356
00:49:54,667 --> 00:50:00,667
CON and thank you very much for
the teams that make the contest
for me what it is. Thank you.

357
00:50:09,250 --> 00:50:16,167
 	>> [Applause].  	>> All right,
last, but certainly not least,
and this is I think one of the

358
00:50:16,167 --> 00:50:20,833
coolest things that happens in
the entire contest, the Capture
the Flag team business

359
00:50:20,833 --> 00:50:26,833
syndicate, come on up.  	>>
[Applause].  	>> Good evening.
I'm Veto Genovest from

360
00:50:36,083 --> 00:50:42,917
Legitimate Business and we have
finished our first year of
Capture the Flag. First, thank

361
00:50:42,917 --> 00:50:48,917
you to the DEF CON community,
the goons, and the community. We
could not do this without your

362
00:50:51,375 --> 00:50:57,292
support and friendship. As
returning hosts, we decided to
step up our game with new

363
00:50:57,292 --> 00:51:03,833
challenges, a new processor
architecture and new evil
tricks. The most visible change

364
00:51:03,833 --> 00:51:09,833
is the DEF CON Capture the Flag
badge which includes an MSP 430
processor, a 900 megahertz radio

365
00:51:12,250 --> 00:51:18,250
and a custom, exploitable
network service called badger.
We also had three armed services

366
00:51:21,208 --> 00:51:27,208
and a service that switched from
emulated 386 to ARM half way
through the game.  	>>

367
00:51:32,833 --> 00:51:38,708
[Laughter]. [Applause].  	>> We
apologize and you're welcome.
 	>> [Laughter].  	>> Also new

368
00:51:38,708 --> 00:51:44,500
this year was an attack
visualizer on the screen behind
us built by Hoju. This lead to

369
00:51:44,500 --> 00:51:50,500
the busiest Capture the Flag
room ever. We've had a few
growing pains, too. A new

370
00:51:53,042 --> 00:51:57,292
scoring algorithm designed to
keep teams from zeroing out to
the bottom of the score board

371
00:51:57,292 --> 00:52:00,708
resulted in teams resulted in
teams zeroing out to the bottom
of the score board.  	>>

372
00:52:00,708 --> 00:52:06,708
[Applause].  	>> We also had
hardware crashes that made life
difficult for a few teams. We

373
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:15,750
have re‑ tabulated the scores to
make sure this was handled in a
fair way. We know you have

374
00:52:15,750 --> 00:52:23,208
improved your ‑ ‑ or we know how
important your CTF time scores
are, so we have recalculated the

375
00:52:23,208 --> 00:52:29,208
scores to make it right. We'll
be posting details, source code
and database dumps soon.  	>>

376
00:52:33,417 --> 00:52:37,417
Hi, everybody, I'm
[indiscernible] from Legitimate
Business Syndicate. All teams

377
00:52:37,417 --> 00:52:41,417
have received the O Droid
hardware that we hosted the
games on this year. So do not

378
00:52:41,417 --> 00:52:47,542
expect to see that next year. We
are stepping up our game harder
next year. I've of the team also

379
00:52:47,542 --> 00:52:54,833
received a CTF badges to take
home. They will build materials
and build sheets for this later

380
00:52:54,833 --> 00:53:00,292
on this year. The first place
team will receive 8 black badges
and 8 leather jackets. So

381
00:53:00,292 --> 00:53:05,542
without further ado, I'd like to
announce the winners. In third
place, a new comer to DEF CON

382
00:53:05,542 --> 00:53:11,542
CTF, dragon sector.  	>>
[Applause].  	>> I believe they
are from Poland. I believe they

383
00:53:18,458 --> 00:53:24,458
are from Poland. In second
place, Kit Conn from Taiwan. And
 	>> [Off mic].  	>> Yeah, you.

384
00:53:36,083 --> 00:53:42,083
And in first place, the
returning chap ones, EPP, the
Proud Parliament of Pony.  	>>

385
00:53:55,042 --> 00:54:01,042
[Applause] [cheering].  	>> It's
a fun time. Everyone should
play. It was a great contest and

386
00:54:06,708 --> 00:54:12,708
see you guys next year.  	>>
[Laughter].  	>> [Applause].
 	>> Thank you and have a good

387
00:54:36,042 --> 00:54:42,042
evening.  	>> [Applause].  	>>
If you wonder what we do with
all your money, we make cool

388
00:54:47,625 --> 00:54:53,625
podiums like this.  	>>
[Laughter].  	>> So, oh, we have
a surprise announcement. So show

389
00:54:58,500 --> 00:55:04,500
the depth of commitment our
attendees will go to, come on
up.  	>> Hey, everyone. My name

390
00:55:10,958 --> 00:55:18,917
is Joe Grand.  	>> [Applause].
 	>> No applause, please. Okay,
so this is, we had an

391
00:55:18,917 --> 00:55:25,750
opportunity to turn a crazy
dinner conversation into a
fundraising event by permanently

392
00:55:25,750 --> 00:55:31,750
marking the skin of our fine
Shaggy from 303. And what we
ended up doing is Shaggy got ale

393
00:55:34,667 --> 00:55:42,042
really crazy tattoo with my
signature on it and an logo of
the jtagulator hardware hacking

394
00:55:42,042 --> 00:55:48,042
tool, amazing art by Eddy, Crypt
paid for it, so his signature is
on there. Besides being

395
00:55:52,458 --> 00:55:59,875
completely insane, Shaggy said,
why don't we raise money and
instead of doing Mohawks, we

396
00:55:59,875 --> 00:56:05,875
permanently marked his skin. If
you want to see it in person,
you can come up here after the

397
00:56:17,667 --> 00:56:23,167
event. Eddy is going to be
standing with him. He'll lift up
his leg, his fine piece of meat

398
00:56:23,167 --> 00:56:29,667
right there, and you can throw a
few bucks to Eddy, which is
going to go to the EFF. Here is

399
00:56:29,667 --> 00:56:35,250
a sneak peek. And come up, take
a look. Give some money to Eddy
for a little final EFF

400
00:56:35,250 --> 00:56:42,542
fundraising. So thanks. And this
just shows the commitment of,
you know, people that are doing

401
00:56:42,542 --> 00:56:48,042
stuff for DEF CON and for EFF
and, you know, whatever you can
do to make a change is

402
00:56:48,042 --> 00:56:52,375
appreciated. So thanks.  	>>
[Off mic].  	>> I know, I know.
Thank you. [Laughter].  	>>

403
00:56:52,375 --> 00:56:58,375
[Applause].  	>> Okay. All
righty. So there's been a lot of
rumors floating around and while

404
00:57:08,875 --> 00:57:13,583
I can neither confirm nor deny,
I just want to let you know it's
about that time to pack your

405
00:57:13,583 --> 00:57:20,833
bags. No, people didn't want to
know and I saw people tweeting
people out, so I'm going to

406
00:57:20,833 --> 00:57:26,792
confirm that those of you who
have been tweeting and
speculating, that we are moving

407
00:57:26,792 --> 00:57:32,792
to the Paris.  	>> [Applause].
 	>> But like everything DEF
CON, it's not what it seems

408
00:57:40,750 --> 00:57:46,292
because we don't want to tell
you ahead of time, it not that
we don't trust you, it's that we

409
00:57:46,292 --> 00:57:53,625
don't trust you.  	>>
[Laughter].  	>> So where we're
at now, the Rio has about

410
00:57:53,625 --> 00:58:00,958
160,000 square feet of space. We
don't know what happened, we
fill up fast and because we

411
00:58:00,958 --> 00:58:06,958
don't take pre‑ reg, we do a lot
of math and look at what Black
Hat is doing and we try to

412
00:58:11,750 --> 00:58:17,750
guess, but you guys came later
than usual and more numbers than
usual and it totally screwed us

413
00:58:17,750 --> 00:58:23,750
up. So we're worried that 160 ‑
‑ going from 160 to 175,000
square feet ‑ ‑ the Rio is

414
00:58:29,667 --> 00:58:35,667
175,000, the Paris is 140,
that's not going to be enough,
so we've decided we're also

415
00:58:37,833 --> 00:58:43,833
going to take over Bali's. So if
you combine both of the square
feet, we're going to go from

416
00:58:49,292 --> 00:58:55,292
about 175,000 to 315,000 square
feet.  	>> [Applause].  	>> So
it's sort of like this

417
00:59:02,125 --> 00:59:08,125
embarrassment of riches, what do
I do with 315,000 square feet?
But lucky, I have you guys, I

418
00:59:10,917 --> 00:59:18,208
have the community, so we are ‑
‑ it's predictable, we're going
to have more village, more

419
00:59:18,208 --> 00:59:21,667
contests. Yes, hardware hacking
village will increase in size.
 	>> [Cheering] [applause].  	>>

420
00:59:21,667 --> 00:59:27,667
How many of you people remember
the old Riviera we had the party
spaces on the top floor?  	>>

421
00:59:35,250 --> 00:59:42,792
[Applause].  	>> Yes. So we have
the entire 26th floor of Bali's
and we have, like, 6 banks of

422
00:59:42,792 --> 00:59:48,792
express elevators that only take
us there.  	>> [Applause].  	>>
So you can expect to see parties

423
00:59:52,375 --> 00:59:59,833
and shit happening on the 26th
floor. I just want to say we
will have plenty of space and

424
00:59:59,833 --> 01:00:05,833
we're going to do a lot of cool
stuff that we've only been
wanting to do. Next year we

425
01:00:10,208 --> 01:00:15,250
might have to close space off
because we're not going to have
enough stuff to fill it.  	>>

426
01:00:17,375 --> 01:00:24,250
[Laughter].  	>> Yeah, I'm not
so sure about that. [Laughter].
The other thing is, you know,

427
01:00:24,250 --> 01:00:29,042
those of you who are in
registration lines that sucked
and were out there and vortexing

428
01:00:29,042 --> 01:00:36,958
around the pool. You have never
done that before. Normally by
Friday evening, you guys did

429
01:00:36,958 --> 01:00:43,375
half way through Thursday. So I
don't know what happened with
the pattern change, next year,

430
01:00:43,375 --> 01:00:48,208
it's not even going to be funny,
we will have like registration
everywhere. There's no way for

431
01:00:48,208 --> 01:00:55,750
you not to get registered. Would
you like a little registration
with that?  	>> [Applause].  	>>

432
01:00:55,750 --> 01:01:03,167
So expect more kinds of music,
more kinds of parties. Who
enjoyed, compared to previous

433
01:01:03,167 --> 01:01:09,792
year to this year, the variety
of parties we had and spaces?
 	>> [Applause].  	>> Now who

434
01:01:09,792 --> 01:01:15,792
saw the crazy robot Army that
would dance to your band? So I
loved that stuff and with all

435
01:01:18,333 --> 01:01:22,917
this space next year, we're just
going to have more stuff to
really show case what we can do

436
01:01:22,917 --> 01:01:28,958
as a community. I'm really
looking forward to it. We might
end up working extra hard, but

437
01:01:28,958 --> 01:01:34,250
it's going to really rock next
year am I want to give you guys
the heads up to be ready for

438
01:01:34,250 --> 01:01:39,375
that. And to make life a little
easier for you guys, it's going
to be surrounded by other

439
01:01:39,375 --> 01:01:46,042
hotels, so it's easier to get
to. So we have done a deal with
the Paris and Bali and the

440
01:01:46,042 --> 01:01:51,958
people who own those hotels, we
will is a bunch of space around
the Paris/Bali, so the rooms are

441
01:01:51,958 --> 01:01:57,958
going to start at like $49 a
night.  	>> [Applause].  	>>
Yeah.  	>> [Applause].  	>> So

442
01:02:01,542 --> 01:02:08,500
finally, we can get you cheaper
housing and so we're going to
have Planet Hollywood, the

443
01:02:08,500 --> 01:02:15,000
Flamingo, the Quad, Cesar's and
Bali's with good rates.  	>>
[Applause].  	>> So before we

444
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:21,000
shut it down and I call for a
round of applause for everybody,
I want to have everybody

445
01:02:25,458 --> 01:02:30,583
acknowledge the awesome work the
hotel has done here and how good
they have been, a good home for

446
01:02:30,583 --> 01:02:36,167
us for so many years and it's
sad to outgrow them, but hey,
you know, you've got to go, you

447
01:02:36,167 --> 01:02:39,792
have to move on, you have to
grow. Let's give a big round of
applause for the Rio, they have

448
01:02:39,792 --> 01:02:45,792
been awesome.  	>> [Applause].
 	>> [Off mic].  	>> Okay, so
with that, I'm going to

449
01:02:58,458 --> 01:03:03,583
officially call it to a close
and I will see you at the bar.
Thank you.  	>> [Applause]

450
01:03:03,583 --> 01:03:05,583
[cheering].
