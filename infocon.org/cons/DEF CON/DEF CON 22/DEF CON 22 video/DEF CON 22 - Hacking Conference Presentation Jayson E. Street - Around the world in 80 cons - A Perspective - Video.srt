1
00:00:00,083 --> 00:00:04,458
>> We start off with cats. I've
got a lot of stuff to cover so
it's like, this is a big rant

2
00:00:04,458 --> 00:00:08,667
for me so I want to make sure we
get right to it. This is the
name of the talk, around the

3
00:00:08,667 --> 00:00:15,125
world in 80 cons. Basically, one
of the things I like to do is
alternate, it's like, one year

4
00:00:15,125 --> 00:00:21,042
I'm going to do an offensive
type team, the next year I want
to rant. I said we'd do a

5
00:00:21,042 --> 00:00:26,583
community talk. Last year I did
a talk on phishing and social
engineering so that was my

6
00:00:26,583 --> 00:00:33,750
offensive talk so we know what
year this is right? There we go.
So, get ready we're going to

7
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:39,958
start ranting. They only thing
you need to know about me is
that I get around a lot. So,

8
00:00:39,958 --> 00:00:46,292
travel and one of the things I
like to talk about when I do
that though, is I don't just go

9
00:00:46,292 --> 00:00:51,250
to the conference, I'm there for
the conference and then I fly
out. I like to visit the place

10
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:56,458
that I'm at. I've spent 11 hours
walking to the (indiscernible)
district in Bejing. I went from

11
00:00:56,458 --> 00:01:01,583
the (indiscernible) of Cairo up
to the Cairo towers which took
seven hours. Great Pizza Hut but

12
00:01:01,583 --> 00:01:06,125
the Nile by the way, it was
really good. I do that, I like
to explore the city, I like to

13
00:01:06,125 --> 00:01:10,375
be there, I like to see what
it's about and see what the
people are like. I wanted to do

14
00:01:10,375 --> 00:01:15,667
a talk about that and guess
what? That talk changed because
of what had occurred so this is

15
00:01:15,667 --> 00:01:19,458
a really weird talk for me so
just buckle in and we're just
going to get through this. One

16
00:01:19,458 --> 00:01:23,292
thing, and most importantly, I'm
not speaking for anybody, I'm
not speaking for a hacker

17
00:01:23,292 --> 00:01:27,625
movement, I'm not speaking for a
community. My perceptions, my
perpectives. Russ Rogers said it

18
00:01:27,625 --> 00:01:33,625
the best; I like tacos. That
means all hackers like tacos.
Right? No, I like pizza. Nothing

19
00:01:38,625 --> 00:01:43,833
against tacos, but no. That's
the whole key thing. It's all
about different perspectives.

20
00:01:43,833 --> 00:01:48,958
This whole talk as you see
through it, is about our
perspectives and perceptions and

21
00:01:48,958 --> 00:01:54,917
how they have been changed and
manipulated over the years. So,
first of all we talk about

22
00:01:54,917 --> 00:02:00,708
computer cultures and the
hacking and always, for some
reasons we bring in the global

23
00:02:00,708 --> 00:02:05,625
part of it. It always gets to
nation state. So, I want to get
that crap right out of the way.

24
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:11,167
So lets start off with the
vendor reports that you see.
Verizon data breach, the one on

25
00:02:11,167 --> 00:02:17,167
the left. That's one from 2013 –
2014 is the one on the right.
Notice how they have covered

26
00:02:19,583 --> 00:02:26,542
more area because that first one
was a little shall we say
lacking? So, what did the

27
00:02:26,542 --> 00:02:33,958
research team do? They decided,
oh, someone reported a breach
from Hoboken, New Jersey. Cover

28
00:02:33,958 --> 00:02:39,958
all of America. There was one
incident in Wu Shi, China. Cover
all of China. Problem solved.

29
00:02:42,083 --> 00:02:45,125
So, now it's a more
comprehensive report. I don't
want to get in a Twitter war

30
00:02:45,125 --> 00:02:48,333
over this report, I've already
done this about this report.
It's a good report. It's got

31
00:02:48,333 --> 00:02:53,625
good numbers, and good data and
good sales points. But, it's not
showing all of the picture. Same

32
00:02:53,625 --> 00:02:59,167
thing with Trustwave, if you see
the one on the left. They have a
great graphic department, that's

33
00:02:59,167 --> 00:03:04,875
awesome because who doesn't love
pie right? It's got some good
data and once again, it's not

34
00:03:04,875 --> 00:03:09,583
telling the whole complete
picture. And then you have the
new reports that came out that

35
00:03:09,583 --> 00:03:14,333
actually looks like a picture of
a rave that I wasn't invited to
which hurt my feelings. But,

36
00:03:14,333 --> 00:03:20,375
it's still got data that you can
use. But, one of my best ones
that I love the most and

37
00:03:20,375 --> 00:03:25,375
literally one of the best sites
that I love is hackmaggedon.com.
Because first of all, not only

38
00:03:25,375 --> 00:03:28,250
do they have pie charts it's
like they actually put the flags
on the pie because let's face

39
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:31,875
it, we're in America. It's like
the only time we know what a
country's flag is when we are

40
00:03:31,875 --> 00:03:37,875
invading it. So, it's really
refreshing to actually see flags
before that occurs. So, that's

41
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:47,000
awesome. But, the most important
part is this right here. His
disclaimer on his site. Again,

42
00:03:49,042 --> 00:03:54,333
no need to repeat that data must
be taken very carefully since
they do refer only to discovered

43
00:03:54,333 --> 00:03:59,250
attacks (the so-called tip of
the iceberg), and hence do not
pretend to be exhaustive but

44
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:04,000
only aim to provide a high level
overview of the global Cyber
landscape. That is such an

45
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,958
awesome disclaimer that I'm not
going to use the word cyber.
That's awesome because he is

46
00:04:08,958 --> 00:04:15,667
honestly saying this is what I
see. This is not the all, this
is not definitive. That concept

47
00:04:15,667 --> 00:04:20,375
of this is what I see and we
need more of that. There are
more reports out there, some are

48
00:04:20,375 --> 00:04:27,542
more technically accurate, more
of them give you a snap shot of
data. This is one. I saw this

49
00:04:27,542 --> 00:04:33,292
one tweeted all over the
Twittter sphere, no this isn't
from War Games by the way. This

50
00:04:33,292 --> 00:04:37,167
is actually a website,
digitalattacksite.com, it shows
the horrible attack. That's on

51
00:04:37,167 --> 00:04:43,167
May 9th. This was from July 22
of this year. Does the
perception change because of the

52
00:04:49,458 --> 00:04:54,708
data? Or is it just the fact we
are looking at a snapshot trying
to change the story to suit our

53
00:04:54,708 --> 00:05:00,708
needs? That didn't get tweeted
all over the twitter sphere.
When it's shooting straight up,

54
00:05:03,125 --> 00:05:07,333
when you see that heavy
concentration from the middle,
that means it's internal denial

55
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:13,042
of service. We don't want to
talk about that part because it
doesn't fit our narrative. >>

56
00:05:13,042 --> 00:05:19,917
Other reports are a little more
blatant in their obscured
perspective of what they see the

57
00:05:19,917 --> 00:05:23,917
world to be like. I have to be
honest. I don't know at what
point when

58
00:05:23,917 --> 00:05:27,458
Richard (indiscernible) when he
was a young boy in school that
China came over and stole his

59
00:05:27,458 --> 00:05:33,667
lunch money but it hurt him
really bad. I want to get a
doll, go up to that guy and say,

60
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:39,667
show me where on the doll where
the China touched your network.
(Laughter) >> It's incredible.

61
00:05:43,417 --> 00:05:48,625
That's not just me. I did a
Google search for mandiant
report, I kid you not, I am

62
00:05:48,625 --> 00:05:56,000
being totally honest. This was
the first image result.
(Laughter) >> Up until just

63
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,500
recently, that, to me, was one
of the most offensive kind of
like scurred, xenophobic type

64
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:07,500
attacks, until Crypteria showed
me this. You are telling me your
product is so great  ‑ ‑ I'm

65
00:06:12,083 --> 00:06:18,083
sorry, not great, what's the
word? Stupid, the only way to
stop the attack is an engine

66
00:06:18,083 --> 00:06:23,000
filter looking for Chinese
characters and that's your
product? That's where your only

67
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:29,375
threat is coming from?
Disgusting. I didn't block out
their name, I didn't censor

68
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:34,083
their name. They can stand by
that if that's what they want to
show, that's World War II

69
00:06:34,083 --> 00:06:39,083
propaganda style right there.
I'm not going to say which side,
the Allies or the Germans, it's

70
00:06:39,083 --> 00:06:44,667
still World War II propaganda
material. It's ridiculous in
this day and age to have

71
00:06:44,667 --> 00:06:49,917
something like that as a decent
marketing campaign. Indecent
maybe. Let's break it down. I

72
00:06:49,917 --> 00:06:54,583
want to get this out of the way
real quick. Let's break it down.
China is bad, right? That's what

73
00:06:54,583 --> 00:06:59,167
we hear. China is bad because
they spy on their citizens, they
spy other countries, they infect

74
00:06:59,167 --> 00:07:03,375
other nations computers with
malware, they try to sensor the
press and try to suppress

75
00:07:03,375 --> 00:07:09,375
protesters. Isn't that horrible?
(Laughter) You know what? We've
got to address this. It's an

76
00:07:15,292 --> 00:07:20,083
uncomfortable thing because I'm
going to Bejing next week. But
it's like, let's break it down

77
00:07:20,083 --> 00:07:25,000
bit by bit. I want to take a
look at each one of these
individually. They spy on their

78
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:32,875
citizens. That's horrible. Oh
wait, this isn't China is it? I
love the fact that it's like,

79
00:07:32,875 --> 00:07:38,167
you know, Congress is all, well
if you have nothing to hide why
are you worried about

80
00:07:38,167 --> 00:07:43,375
monitoring? Oh my god, the CIA
was monitoring computers that
they own that we were using.

81
00:07:43,375 --> 00:07:49,375
That is horrible. That outrage
for them, but not us. The best
part about it is this CIA

82
00:07:53,250 --> 00:08:00,333
apologizes. So, in other words,
other countries, other nation
states, when you hack us make

83
00:08:00,333 --> 00:08:05,667
sure you sure you send an
apology letter and it's all
good. I guess that was the part

84
00:08:05,667 --> 00:08:13,417
that was missing. You can't just
steal the data, you've got to
say sorry. So, there is that.

85
00:08:13,417 --> 00:08:21,167
They spy on other countries. I
will have to tell you this. Two
points, first of all how bad of

86
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:27,167
a person or country do you have
to be to make a German that sad?
(Laughter) >> I mean, seriously?

87
00:08:31,542 --> 00:08:37,542
She got groped by George W, and
she didn't look that bad. One of
the other things that gets me is

88
00:08:39,833 --> 00:08:43,708
in the lower left, you see and
Italian magazine that says U.S.
spies listen to the Pope,

89
00:08:43,708 --> 00:08:50,500
Vatican says unaware. Guys, I
don't care what religion you
are, atheist, Buddhist,

90
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:56,917
whatever, we all have to admit,
seriously this is a pretty good
Pope, I like this Pope, he's a

91
00:08:56,917 --> 00:09:03,625
cool Pope. He takes selfies, for
god's sake, how cool is that?
He's a pretty good freaking

92
00:09:03,625 --> 00:09:08,250
Pope. Why not the other Pope,
the guy with the red shoes? He
looked a little sketchy ok? I

93
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:14,583
could understand that, but you
are actually spying on this
Pope? That's just not cool. They

94
00:09:14,583 --> 00:09:19,875
are doing that. They infected
other nations computers with
malware, which that is horrible.

95
00:09:19,875 --> 00:09:25,417
That should be an act of war. Oh
wait, except for when we do it,
that's cool. One of the best

96
00:09:25,417 --> 00:09:31,417
denials of an attack I have ever
seen is from the U.S. when they
were like "no, we did not hack

97
00:09:33,458 --> 00:09:40,667
into those centrifuges in Iran,"
that wonderfully orchestrated,
brilliantly executed, well

98
00:09:40,667 --> 00:09:46,667
thought out, masterpiece of an
attack, wasn't us. That was
great. I thought that was

99
00:09:50,625 --> 00:09:54,917
awesome. They try to sensor the
press. Well luck for us, we have
the freedom of speech, the first

100
00:09:54,917 --> 00:10:00,917
amendment rights to protect us
except when we don't, so that's
not cool. Like a roller coaster 

101
00:10:08,083 --> 00:10:12,708
‑ ‑ not amusing, and it's not, I
like this one here, they try to
suppress protesters, because

102
00:10:12,708 --> 00:10:19,250
this is hilarious. This is
actually what they were called,
free speech zones that George W

103
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:23,333
set up. You may not be able to
notice this, the machine guns
and the iron fences. That was

104
00:10:23,333 --> 00:10:30,250
the free speech zones when you
protested at some his rallies.
So that was good; where we had a

105
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:36,000
free zone. And the other one
where the U.S. Army hired spies
to go undercover, you know what

106
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:42,000
the anti‑war protesters are
talking about? The Quakers,
that's your threat, one step

107
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:51,833
above the Amish and you're going
after those guys? That little
living room meeting -- going

108
00:10:51,833 --> 00:10:59,708
around eating coffee and
crumpets is dangerous. So, they
are doing that too. Basically

109
00:10:59,708 --> 00:11:07,583
what I am trying to get at is
stop saying this country is
doing X. It's all countries are

110
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:15,292
doing X. This is a report by
command and control servers all
around the world, they are

111
00:11:15,292 --> 00:11:21,292
everywhere, every country is
doing these kinds of attacks,
even in Canada. Canada! I can

112
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:30,792
just imagine how the hackers
over there -- excuse me, pardon
me, I have to pawn your network

113
00:11:30,792 --> 00:11:35,000
now and I apologize. That is
exactly how I'm imaging it, it's
like, oh you should have

114
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,750
(indiscernible) on the internet,
that's too bad, sorry. Even
Canada is doing it. It's like,

115
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:44,750
so you know that's bad. So, now
that we have that crap, I mean
that stuff out of the way, let's

116
00:11:51,875 --> 00:11:57,167
get to the real stuff. I wanted
to start talking about the
hacking cultures I have seen

117
00:11:57,167 --> 00:12:01,917
around the world and how they
are different. I will give one
experience of my perception and

118
00:12:01,917 --> 00:12:07,750
then I want to give an actual
survey I sent out around the
world and had them fill it out

119
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:14,292
and how it started changing the
way my talk was going to be.
Let's start with China, Asia,

120
00:12:14,292 --> 00:12:20,292
South Pacific. I was going to
start talking about how one of
my first experiences when I went

121
00:12:22,917 --> 00:12:29,000
to China four or five years ago,
but I have a new one now. A
couple weeks ago I invited Dave

122
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:34,875
Kennedy over to the Bejing
Institute of Technology to give
a lecture there. And Dave was a

123
00:12:34,875 --> 00:12:42,250
little trepidatious, a little
like okay, Jayson, you expect a
black van at the airport, he had

124
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:48,500
preconceived notions just like I
did. He was like, okay this is
the way it's going to be. When I

125
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:55,750
first went all I knew was what I
saw in the media, the press. By
the time the trip was over, he

126
00:12:55,750 --> 00:13:01,750
was like, Jayson that was one of
the best experiences of my life.
It opened his eyes and he got

127
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:09,167
the view of the other thing
going on. That is a beautiful
that we all need to do and we

128
00:13:09,167 --> 00:13:14,250
all need to understand. It's not
just what we are being told but
we need to experience, see for

129
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:20,750
ourselves how that stuff
actually works. Let's go with
the survey I sent out. I sent a

130
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:26,458
lot of questions. These are the
ones I centered on the most.
What country are you familiar

131
00:13:26,458 --> 00:13:34,375
with? I do not edit what they
are saying. I currently live in
China, I spend half between the

132
00:13:34,375 --> 00:13:40,000
U.S. and China, how did you find
out about hacking? Just a simple
thought, how can I get unlimited

133
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,833
gold and rice at the beginning
and beat Romance and Three
Kingdom, which is made by

134
00:13:44,833 --> 00:13:51,417
(indiscernible). It is Nintendo
white/red game box in the late
1980s when I was 20. He had a

135
00:13:51,417 --> 00:13:58,292
need, as a hacker, a necessity.
Who doesn't want to beat video
games and who wants to work that

136
00:13:58,292 --> 00:14:04,750
hard to do it. So boom, let me
find it, right? It's like in
your region how is hacking seen

137
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:09,667
by the general public? Overall
it still trends towards
negative, public lack of

138
00:14:09,667 --> 00:14:14,417
understanding, even people who
accepted hacking as a skill, a
method but most people stay away

139
00:14:14,417 --> 00:14:20,917
from it. Is hacking in our
region seen more as crime,
activist nation state or other?

140
00:14:20,917 --> 00:14:27,333
Public media defines, depends on
official needs, today it may be
a crime, next day is national

141
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:32,208
heroes. Some days it is a
technical challenge. Like most
of the places it's a mixture,

142
00:14:32,208 --> 00:14:37,458
some of criminals to be used for
national interest under certain
control, official security

143
00:14:37,458 --> 00:14:42,917
workers may conduct hacktivist
or crime in his or her leisure
time. Some can be hired overseas

144
00:14:42,917 --> 00:14:49,500
interests. I have actually seen
different hacker groups creating
out, bot nets through other

145
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:52,958
countries to hack so it looks
like it's coming from China,
because who cares it's coming

146
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:59,667
from China, not knowing it's
actually America or Russia, or
Asia but the one sponsoring the

147
00:14:59,667 --> 00:15:05,667
attack. So, let's go to the next
one, let's talk about Europe.
One of my experiences now was

148
00:15:11,708 --> 00:15:15,708
(indiscernible) if you are not
familiar with (indiscernible)
it's a DEF CON conference,

149
00:15:15,708 --> 00:15:21,708
viewed by 2000 people, a huge
thing at Euro Disney, it's DEF
CON in a 24 hour period.

150
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:30,958
Literally, it's Night of Hacks,
it goes all night. They start
off talks around 8:00, 10:00 in

151
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:40,458
the morning and 8:00 at night
it's workshops, you have a
(indiscernible) village, you've

152
00:15:40,458 --> 00:15:47,958
got hardware hacking, it is the
true distilled essence of –
you've got a massive capture the

153
00:15:47,958 --> 00:15:55,417
flag going on, that was the main
draw, but the essence of DEF
CON, pure socializing and

154
00:15:55,417 --> 00:16:03,375
hacking and learning as much as
you can crammed into this one
time frame. Bring a lot of

155
00:16:03,375 --> 00:16:05,875
No-Doz and 5-Hour Energy drinks
with you because they don't have
them readily available because

156
00:16:05,875 --> 00:16:11,417
it's at Euro Disney. I had to
bring up one of the creepiest
moments of my life, being a

157
00:16:11,417 --> 00:16:17,417
hacker at Charles De Gaulle
Airport in a hoodie, a suitcase
and sunglasses, with stickers on

158
00:16:21,583 --> 00:16:27,583
the suitcase waiting for the
Disney shuttle. (Laughter) I
actually had this little girl

159
00:16:30,583 --> 00:16:36,500
walking next to me and her dad
pulled her aside and I thought
dude, I'm not even mad. That was

160
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:43,333
a good call. I look sketchy
right now. But it's at Euro
Disney, great conference,

161
00:16:43,333 --> 00:16:49,500
hacking Paris, the Black Hat
version, but less sucky. It's a
good place to go check out.

162
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:55,500
Let's talk about the survey.
He's from Croatia, I traveled a
lot but since I've lived here

163
00:16:57,792 --> 00:17:02,833
all my life, the answers is the
same. He found out hacking, the
term, probably from the movie

164
00:17:02,833 --> 00:17:08,958
"Hackers". I love a lot of
international responses I got
were from different movies. I do

165
00:17:08,958 --> 00:17:13,458
personally believe that Angelina
Jolie has done more for starting
the hacker movement than any

166
00:17:13,458 --> 00:17:18,708
other movie around. Thank you,
Angelina, I still want my
awkward hug. In your region how

167
00:17:18,708 --> 00:17:24,083
has hacking seen by the general
public. The media portrays
hackers as criminal master minds

168
00:17:24,083 --> 00:17:29,833
that infiltrate system from
their dark rooms. I am sure you
know the cliché quite well.

169
00:17:29,833 --> 00:17:35,167
Unfortunately, yes, I do. Is
hacking in your region seen more
for crime, hacktivist, nation

170
00:17:35,167 --> 00:17:42,625
state or other. Once again,
crime. Seeing a theme here,
people? It continues. My last, I

171
00:17:42,625 --> 00:17:48,625
went to Brazil once, for a
conference, and I remembered
going to the speaker dinner and

172
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:58,375
the guy was like, this is
hackers aren't only a big thing
down here, it's not illegal to

173
00:17:58,375 --> 00:18:04,125
hack so it's not cool and no one
really – they just think we're
nerds. I don't think that we are

174
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:10,125
hip or part of it or edgy, stuff
like that. I'm like, I am sorry,
maybe you'll get arrested soon.

175
00:18:12,792 --> 00:18:20,292
(Laughter) >> I don't -- good
luck with that. I don't know.
How do you answer that? The good

176
00:18:20,292 --> 00:18:26,333
news for him is that now they've
enacted laws and now Brazil does
have cybercrime law and now he's

177
00:18:26,333 --> 00:18:33,542
an outlaw. Yay, for him, I
guess. So that was my experience
in Brazil. Let's talk to someone

178
00:18:33,542 --> 00:18:38,167
who has there in Brazil, lived
there. How did you find out
about hacking? One of the best

179
00:18:38,167 --> 00:18:45,167
answers I have ever gotten on
the survey. "Trying to get
things done." Exactly right.

180
00:18:45,167 --> 00:18:50,458
That's the truest essence of
hacking. I am trying to get
something done. Most discoveries

181
00:18:50,458 --> 00:18:56,083
are because I am trying to get
something done. How is hacking
seen by the general public in

182
00:18:56,083 --> 00:19:02,708
your region? Good and bad, at
this point in time unless you
are doing something you wouldn't

183
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:08,292
be aware of hacking, online
banking being implemented in 96,
97, bankers activity started

184
00:19:08,292 --> 00:19:14,833
increasing in Brazil. Banker's
activity means credit card
fraud, bank theft online, things

185
00:19:14,833 --> 00:19:18,917
like that. Is hacking in your
region seen more as a crime,
hacktivist, nation state or

186
00:19:18,917 --> 00:19:23,917
other. Considering those who
don't know anything about it
seeing stuff in the news mostly

187
00:19:23,917 --> 00:19:28,208
tied to crime and sometimes
hactivism. In the corporate
world a better understanding to

188
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:35,500
ethical hacking. I am getting
these over the course of a
month, I'm getting these other

189
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:43,375
surveys, better reports and
still seeing the same trend. It
does get me angry. My first

190
00:19:43,375 --> 00:19:49,375
experience to Africa was to go
to Cairo. Some people say that's
Egypt, that's Middle East. It's

191
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:59,958
on the continent of Africa, it's
Africa. I went to Cairo, it was
an awesome conference. But

192
00:19:59,958 --> 00:20:05,458
hackers don't dress like
hackers, or my mental image of
what hackers are in my

193
00:20:05,458 --> 00:20:11,333
perception. Everybody was in
suits. They made me wear a suit.
A disadvantage, it made me look

194
00:20:11,333 --> 00:20:17,333
normal. They thought I was
normal and they were disabused
once I started talking. That is

195
00:20:20,667 --> 00:20:25,708
actually me giving two students
the rabbit ears as they are
getting picture with Jayson. All

196
00:20:25,708 --> 00:20:33,083
good. My best photo bomb I have
ever done, one student taking
the picture behind the banner,

197
00:20:33,083 --> 00:20:40,125
we all take that picture, you
are doing it, behind the DEF CON
banner, you've got to take that

198
00:20:40,125 --> 00:20:47,667
picture and be like "I'm here."
So he is taking that picture at
his first conference ever,

199
00:20:47,667 --> 00:20:54,250
taking the picture not knowing
that 20 feet behind him in my
suit I'm going. (Laughter) >> I

200
00:20:54,250 --> 00:21:02,125
love that picture. That was a
very, very polite, very
official, very sedate crowd. I

201
00:21:02,125 --> 00:21:09,292
talked later, met with them
after the conference and all of
a sudden it all changed, but the

202
00:21:09,292 --> 00:21:16,375
organization, the group, was a
little different. Let's talk
about what's going on in Egypt.

203
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:22,375
I love this one. Caught a virus
in 2005, a certain person
downloaded a pirated game and it

204
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:30,667
was back doored, wonder how
those virus worms worked.
Learned some programming by

205
00:21:30,667 --> 00:21:37,708
first doing sample virus sources
and walked the road and never
went back. [Applauding] That's

206
00:21:37,708 --> 00:21:43,208
what it's about. Oh my gosh, I
got pawned. That's sort of cool,
how did that happen? Let me

207
00:21:43,208 --> 00:21:49,917
figure it out. I love that
answer. How is hacking seen by
the general public? In your

208
00:21:49,917 --> 00:21:57,250
region how is hacking generally
viewed by the public. It is
viewed as hacking other people

209
00:21:57,250 --> 00:22:03,250
people's Facebook and Yahoo
accounts. People that is a
depressing and sad. They still

210
00:22:06,542 --> 00:22:12,542
use Yahoo. Take a moment, sink
that in. Horrible. Hacking, in
your region is seen more as

211
00:22:16,292 --> 00:22:22,792
crime, hacktivis, nation state,
other. Most view as a crime. Few
knew about hacktivism, still

212
00:22:22,792 --> 00:22:28,583
seen as a crime than hacktivism.
Still is something done by
criminals and nefarious people

213
00:22:28,583 --> 00:22:35,542
trying to get freedom. I have
gone to the Middle East and I
have broken into places, they

214
00:22:35,542 --> 00:22:41,958
let me back, which is awesome.
One of the first trips there,
Beirut, Lebanon, really cool

215
00:22:41,958 --> 00:22:45,792
guy, what's going on? Wanted to
show me something so look on my
laptop, he shows me the screens

216
00:22:45,792 --> 00:22:51,917
and I'm like, what is that? Oh,
that's the national telecom
system. I am admin on in, root

217
00:22:51,917 --> 00:22:57,917
on it. I have had access for
four years. I am like what are
you doing with it? Not paying

218
00:23:04,542 --> 00:23:11,708
your bill? Getting into other
peoples' account? I still pay my
bill, I just have access is that

219
00:23:11,708 --> 00:23:17,583
cool? I thought that was
awesome, he's just an adventure
explorer. I don't suggest you do

220
00:23:17,583 --> 00:23:22,917
that in your country's telecom
system, but it was like the Wild
Wild West, totally cool,

221
00:23:22,917 --> 00:23:28,125
adventurist spirit, not the
lawyer spirit. So let's talk
about Lebanon, how did you find

222
00:23:28,125 --> 00:23:34,125
out about hacking, from the BBS,
mIRC. In your region how do you
think hacking is seen by the

223
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:43,750
general public. There is huge
lack of awareness, lack of
exposure of countries hacking

224
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:50,625
wise and hard for young people
to grow up with good access to
that culture. A lot of the

225
00:23:50,625 --> 00:23:55,958
internet over there is 3G, 4G,
it's like they are all cellular,
not many land lines with direct

226
00:23:55,958 --> 00:24:00,917
connections to people's houses.
You carry your Internet with
you. Is hacking in your region

227
00:24:00,917 --> 00:24:04,958
seen more as more of a crime,
hacktivist, nation state or
other. Again, lack of awareness

228
00:24:04,958 --> 00:24:11,167
results in people hearing about
hacking on the news. Since media
just reports on cyber criminals,

229
00:24:11,167 --> 00:24:17,625
this is the way they see hackers
in general. I am seriously
telling you I am getting pissed.

230
00:24:17,625 --> 00:24:24,833
There was an extra boost of
Pepsi consumption during getting
these surveys. Let's go on to

231
00:24:24,833 --> 00:24:30,833
North America. I will qualify:
One of the main nonconsensual,
awkward hugs that I will

232
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:40,750
continue to get is from Bruce
Potter, he hates them so much,
but Heidi gives me permission so

233
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:48,292
too bad for Bruce. Let me talk
about (indiscernible) and Def
Con and in Derby Con. There are

234
00:24:48,292 --> 00:24:53,500
some many conferences here that
you get to see groups of people,
and I want to center on DEF CON

235
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:56,875
and it's just because I'm here
and I am trying to play to the
crowd, I'm being honest. This is

236
00:24:56,875 --> 00:25:03,292
my tenth anniversary here. If
you know me and knew me before
that you will realize I have

237
00:25:03,292 --> 00:25:10,667
created a family here and I see
these people all the time.
(Applause) >> I know more what's

238
00:25:10,667 --> 00:25:16,750
going on with hackers in
different parts of the world,
places here than I know what's

239
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:24,625
going on with my real family. I
hope they are not watching, but
still, this has given me a home,

240
00:25:24,625 --> 00:25:29,917
a place to be. I would not be
here, not even around if it
wasn't for the people I met. I

241
00:25:29,917 --> 00:25:35,333
am grateful for that and humbled
by the acceptance of these
people. That's my experience in

242
00:25:35,333 --> 00:25:41,333
America with DEF CON. Let's talk
about what country we are more
familiar with. Canada is in

243
00:25:45,208 --> 00:25:51,875
North America so I didn't go
American but familiar, like all
Canadians I am stupidly aware of

244
00:25:51,875 --> 00:25:58,750
the USA. How did you hear about
hacking? I don't know, that's
what it was called until many

245
00:25:58,750 --> 00:26:03,333
years later. I presumed everyone
took things apart to figure out
how they worked. I ultimately

246
00:26:03,333 --> 00:26:08,542
put two and two in the late 80's
when I was going back and forth
between data pack and figured

247
00:26:08,542 --> 00:26:12,750
outgoing between Datapac and
Fidonet. In other words, it's
human nature. Just what it was.

248
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:18,750
We don't know our prejudice, we
don't know what we are supposed
to shun until we are taught by

249
00:26:20,875 --> 00:26:27,667
someone older usually. But as
children we don't have that, we
have to learn it from others. In

250
00:26:27,667 --> 00:26:32,208
your region how is hacking seen
by the general public. It's a
media terminology, most

251
00:26:32,208 --> 00:26:39,625
universally reviled, hacking,
doing cool stuff is very well
received. Is hacking in your

252
00:26:39,625 --> 00:26:44,958
region seen as more of a crime,
hacktivist, nation state or
other. The media terminology is

253
00:26:44,958 --> 00:26:48,542
seen as a negative thing
comprised largely of
(indiscernible) and hacktivism.

254
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:57,500
Where did we come from, people?
Is this okay with you? That this
is what is seen? That no matter

255
00:27:03,125 --> 00:27:08,958
what region my talk was supposed
to be about how Malaysian
hackers are more into hacker

256
00:27:08,958 --> 00:27:15,208
spaces, how the Germans love
encrypted protocols, how the
Brazilians do banker cards. I

257
00:27:15,208 --> 00:27:20,625
was trying to do a talk about
the diversity of the hacking
culture and I found a single

258
00:27:20,625 --> 00:27:27,958
thread that unites us: We're
seen as criminals. I am not
happy about that, because this

259
00:27:27,958 --> 00:27:33,958
is who we come from. This is who
we come from. Allen Turing, the
godfather photography saved

260
00:27:42,542 --> 00:27:49,500
thousands on thousands of lives
during World War II helping
crack the Enigma machine. After

261
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:53,542
the war his thank you was
castration until he drove
himself to suicide because he

262
00:27:53,542 --> 00:27:59,542
wasn't socially acceptable by
the people he saved. What about
Tesla, the godfather of open

263
00:28:02,333 --> 00:28:09,500
source, because we are so befret
of his inventions, because he
didn't want to make a profit.

264
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:16,125
Companies didn't want to invest
in it, until he died alone in
his hotel room it took two days

265
00:28:16,125 --> 00:28:22,125
to find his body. Thank you for
your inventions, sir. What about
Ada Lovelace, one quick mention

266
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:30,750
on women in tech debate, Ada
Lovelace was the first
programmer, women started this

267
00:28:33,833 --> 00:28:39,833
industry, that's all there is to
that. (Applause) >> First
computer programmer shunned and

268
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:49,292
exiled from her family, died
from treatment of cancer, not
the cancer itself. What about

269
00:28:49,292 --> 00:28:56,625
Paul Ottlet from Belgium? He
created and (indiscernible) the
Internet. Sorry Al Gore. Died in

270
00:28:56,625 --> 00:29:02,625
1944, penniless and broke but
everyone is still using his
indexing system but that whole

271
00:29:07,083 --> 00:29:12,875
other dream of being together as
a community and uniting the
world, we don't have time for

272
00:29:12,875 --> 00:29:19,792
that. I would talk about
Leonardo Da Vinci, because he is
the uber hacker, he is the

273
00:29:19,792 --> 00:29:24,833
inspiration for every hacker to
try to be but he died really
well, people loved him, the

274
00:29:24,833 --> 00:29:30,833
prince gave him a mansion to
retire in, but we will forget
that guy. Those are the

275
00:29:33,333 --> 00:29:39,333
inventors. Hacking is artistry,
it is invention. I see something
here, let me make it better.

276
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:59,208
That's not what we see now. When
did it change? When did we
become the villains in this

277
00:29:59,208 --> 00:30:05,208
story? It wasn't 200 years ago
because 40 years ago there were
plenty of other changes. But let

278
00:30:08,667 --> 00:30:14,667
me give you a snapshot of the
current justice system today. I
am not going to talk about why

279
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:22,000
or who they should be or the
(indiscernible) was just but
talking about sentencing. Jeremy

280
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:28,583
Hammond, 10 years for hacking,
Angie "Weev" Auenheimer 10 years
for hacking, which was basically

281
00:30:28,583 --> 00:30:34,250
essence that he was enumerating
URL's that were publicly
addressable. You are in the 90s,

282
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:41,042
going to the websites with the
picture folders, you did the
same thing. But that's what he

283
00:30:41,042 --> 00:30:48,000
was arrested for and given 10
years for. Max Ray Butler, 13
years for hacking. Roman Vega,

284
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:54,000
18 years for hacking. Albert
Gonzales, 20 years for hacking.
Is that fair? Some people would

285
00:30:56,625 --> 00:31:04,250
say yes. People like me think
maybe a little excessive. Ma'Lik
Richmond one year for rape.

286
00:31:04,250 --> 00:31:09,500
Gerhard Becker, one year for
involuntary manslaughter of a
firefighter. Trent Mays, two

287
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:15,083
years for rape, the person who
was actually exposed the two
rapists will probably get 10 or

288
00:31:15,083 --> 00:31:21,250
20. Seth Hornberger, 3 to 6
years, voluntary manslaughter.
And don't forget Jessica

289
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:27,250
Fraraccio, five years for murder
of a 23 month year old toddler
that she was babysitting. She

290
00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:36,833
bashed his head in. Us hackers
would like to be mysterious, on
the outside, guess what? Juries

291
00:31:36,833 --> 00:31:43,125
are made of people and what
people don't understand they
fear and what they fear they try

292
00:31:43,125 --> 00:31:49,125
to destroy. I was told at a
conference, a guy gave me a
piece of insight I never thought

293
00:31:49,125 --> 00:31:55,833
of before. It's sad and
depressing, he said dude, the
reason is hacking is new,

294
00:31:55,833 --> 00:32:01,833
unknown. We have gotten
thousands and thousands of years
to get used to murder. Juries

295
00:32:04,167 --> 00:32:11,500
know murder very well. We know
about rape, killing, stealing,
stabbing, those things. The

296
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:17,250
computer thing is new. We are
more fearful of that. How
twisted, sick and right is that?

297
00:32:21,125 --> 00:32:27,125
What about these criminals?
Straight up criminals actually
admit it, Bill & Paul hacked a

298
00:32:29,958 --> 00:32:34,542
company's accounting file to try
to get free computing time, got
access to the administrator's

299
00:32:34,542 --> 00:32:39,500
password used to steal the
company's internal accounting
file. Allen doesn't go into

300
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:44,875
detail on how they got the
password, hoping to get free
accounts, got caught, the

301
00:32:44,875 --> 00:32:50,875
company booted them. Bad guys,
hacking our network, stealing
our data, grabbing our access,

302
00:32:54,125 --> 00:33:01,875
we will teach you a lesson. You
don't get more free computing
time at school. What about these

303
00:33:01,875 --> 00:33:07,875
two thieves? Straight up hood.
(Laughter) >> What did they do?
They sold illegal equipment to

304
00:33:14,042 --> 00:33:21,250
defraud a legitimate working
business of profits they were
entitled to, the service they

305
00:33:21,250 --> 00:33:27,250
were providing. But we showed
them, didn't we? Everybody raise
up your iPhone. Exactly. That's

306
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:37,750
what happened to those
criminals, just 40, 50 years ago
that's how we handled hackers.

307
00:33:40,708 --> 00:33:46,000
Four years ago, not so much.
Another young man who already
founded a multimillion dollar

308
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:51,417
company broke into a utility
closet at MIT, hooked up a
laptop to the campus network

309
00:33:51,417 --> 00:33:58,792
downloaded four million academic
journals, most in the public
domain from a paid archive to

310
00:33:58,792 --> 00:34:06,208
which he had a subscription he
paid for. He was arrested,
indicted twice, had a trial that

311
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:12,542
had begun in April, could have
faced 50 years in federal prison
and a million dollar fine. His

312
00:34:12,542 --> 00:34:19,542
name was Aaron Schwartz and he
took his life because of it. He
was actually hounded to death

313
00:34:19,542 --> 00:34:25,542
because of that crime. That's
now acceptable. That's what we
are supposed to say is okay. No,

314
00:34:30,208 --> 00:34:36,208
that is not okay. To have such
an ignorant government telling
us this is the crime and letting

315
00:34:38,833 --> 00:34:46,292
them show us the laws. Letting
them keep the laws on the books
without trying to make a change

316
00:34:46,292 --> 00:34:52,292
on it. We need to start. Because
if we don't, they will keep
doing this. Look at some of

317
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:59,625
these pictures, people. I mean
the one on the right looks like
the (indiscernible) coming after

318
00:34:59,625 --> 00:35:05,500
me. Every time I see that
picture I want to throw a ring
at it, not because I like it.

319
00:35:08,042 --> 00:35:14,042
That's ridiculous! That is what
they see. That is what the
public sees when they look at

320
00:35:16,750 --> 00:35:24,333
you and you say you are a
hacker. I have a cold computer
room. Okay? I have extra air

321
00:35:24,333 --> 00:35:29,833
conditioning unit in the window.
I have never been so cold that I
need the hoody up and a ski mask

322
00:35:29,833 --> 00:35:35,833
on to work. How do they get the
images? Sometimes we help. I
told Mikko, I had to make fun of

323
00:35:39,042 --> 00:35:45,042
him, the other guys are
(indiscernible) I didn't want to
piss them off. We like to help

324
00:35:50,458 --> 00:35:57,000
with that image, because we like
being cool. I don't know about
you, but in high school I was

325
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:04,542
not very cool. At all. Okay,
junior high I wasn't very cool.
Elementary, never been cool,

326
00:36:04,542 --> 00:36:10,542
dudes, didn't happen. >>
AUDIENCE: You are now. >> Thank
you for that. We say that, and

327
00:36:15,042 --> 00:36:19,917
we want that, want to be that
different, that outside. But
they are using it against us. So

328
00:36:19,917 --> 00:36:25,917
what are we going to do? You
have to start changing the
story. I really hate this

329
00:36:29,750 --> 00:36:35,292
because this actually shows you,
this is from Night to Hack on
the left talking about pirates,

330
00:36:35,292 --> 00:36:40,042
but if you are a good guy,
working with Raytheon and
contractors, doing Ninja, screw

331
00:36:40,042 --> 00:36:46,042
that, I am a Ninja, sorry
pirates. Those geeks on the
computers using Windows are not

332
00:36:49,333 --> 00:36:55,333
Ninjas. Ask my kids. My daughter
got in trouble on the bus
fighting, defending my Ninja

333
00:37:08,333 --> 00:37:12,292
honor. There was a sad
conversation that day when I
said it was a secret within the

334
00:37:12,292 --> 00:37:15,917
family. We see stories being
skewered and manipulated. Look
at this one. Just based on a

335
00:37:15,917 --> 00:37:22,792
video game, been criticized for
promoting hacking. What the heck
is wrong with us? What the heck

336
00:37:22,792 --> 00:37:27,875
is wrong with him? Being on the
wrong side of Glenn Beck is
being on the right side, as far

337
00:37:27,875 --> 00:37:33,875
as I am concerned, my personal
opinion. Okay? I like to think
that's a witty comeback but

338
00:37:36,167 --> 00:37:42,167
nothing was wittier than this.
From Bravo Hacks, I hear Watch
dogs teaches you to hack, going

339
00:37:44,167 --> 00:37:50,167
to expense for educational
training purposes and submit for
CISSP creds. That is awesome.

340
00:37:52,833 --> 00:37:58,833
Here's another one and I will do
my one over and rant now, over
here, after DerbyCon we had a

341
00:38:04,583 --> 00:38:09,750
guy come on, this is Sterling
Riggs jerkoff, by the way, my
personal nickname for him, we

342
00:38:09,750 --> 00:38:14,250
are that close, Sterling Riggs
jerkoff posted on Facebook, I
can't talk in his voice, I don't

343
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:20,250
know how I feel about this
DerbyCon happening at the Hyatt
downtown, it's a convention for

344
00:38:22,958 --> 00:38:30,333
computer hackers! Sessions
include password cracking,
hacker war games and a lot

345
00:38:30,333 --> 00:38:36,333
pavilion. Thoughts? Guess what?
There were some thoughts. It's
the Internet, don't we all have

346
00:38:38,917 --> 00:38:44,292
them? Greg Troutman, the LPD and
FBI should raid the convention
and arrest of the people were

347
00:38:44,292 --> 00:38:51,292
doing the training. They were in
training, idiot! Darcy Fraiser,
so overcome she could only use

348
00:38:51,292 --> 00:38:59,167
an emoticon. Connie
(indiscernible) I bet no
arrests, more like employment

349
00:38:59,167 --> 00:39:04,667
opportunities. Very good ones,
actually. Jenny Smith, wow,
that's insane. Have you read the

350
00:39:04,667 --> 00:39:10,750
rest of the comments? Sean
Goodman, what about classes on
mugging, car and theft? Brenda

351
00:39:10,750 --> 00:39:15,833
(indiscernible), Sean, that's
next week, she's the witty one
in the bunch, LOL. Amber Nicole

352
00:39:15,833 --> 00:39:20,833
says, I think it's stupid.
Amber, you didn't capitalize
"I", I think you are stupid. And

353
00:39:20,833 --> 00:39:27,875
then (indiscernible) goes arrest
them all. I seriously expected
the targeted advertising on

354
00:39:27,875 --> 00:39:33,875
Facebook would be for pitch
forks and fire. Guess what
happened? (Indiscernible) geek

355
00:39:40,875 --> 00:39:46,875
saw it: Posted on Twitter, hey,
guys check out this insane
thread going on, so what did we

356
00:39:50,542 --> 00:39:56,542
do as hackers? We started
commenting. At first we think my
gosh, must have been horrible.

357
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:05,125
We started informing, educating,
telling people what it was
about, trying to change their

358
00:40:05,125 --> 00:40:11,042
perception, trying to show them,
this is what hacking is, this is
what the conference was about,

359
00:40:11,042 --> 00:40:15,000
try to come next year. We were
trying to bring an olive branch
out, stop fearing us. So,

360
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:21,625
Sterling Riggs jerkoff did the
only responsible thing a good
reporter could do and he

361
00:40:21,625 --> 00:40:28,958
destroyed the thread, the only
screen shots of this thread
because he deleted it, it was no

362
00:40:28,958 --> 00:40:34,958
longer filling his narrative.
That's horrible, right? Well,
no, it's just his right. I agree

363
00:40:40,708 --> 00:40:46,708
with you, but guess what else? I
am guilty of the same exact
thing. I am a hypocrite. I don't

364
00:40:49,625 --> 00:40:55,625
mind, I am being honest. Because
I loved making fun of this lady.
I loved making fun of the

365
00:40:58,917 --> 00:41:06,292
McDonald's hot coffee lady,
because it was hilarious. Oh, I
spilled coffee, million dollars

366
00:41:06,292 --> 00:41:12,875
please. The judge was on Jay
Leno, everybody liked to make
fun of this. Everybody loved to

367
00:41:12,875 --> 00:41:18,875
make fun of the hot coffee lady.
She was the reason why we say
"water is wet, coffee is hot.

368
00:41:23,375 --> 00:41:29,375
Please don't stick this in your
eye." Isn't that ridiculously
stupid? Until you meet her. You

369
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:38,875
realize she received third
degree burns over 50% of her
body that required skin grafts.

370
00:41:38,875 --> 00:41:44,875
All she asked for was emergency
room expenses, treatment, and
they said here's $800. Until you

371
00:41:48,250 --> 00:41:54,250
realize she went to court to get
expenses paid. The court awarded
her not what she asked for, but

372
00:41:58,292 --> 00:42:04,292
two days, two days coffee
sales." Just two days of their
coffee sales profit. That

373
00:42:11,708 --> 00:42:19,667
totaled up to $2.9 million. She
received less than $500,000. I
have met the McDonald's coffee

374
00:42:19,667 --> 00:42:25,667
lady and she is us. That story
was changed because they had a
voice and thought they could

375
00:42:28,250 --> 00:42:34,792
change it, and they got away
with it for a long time. How
long will we let them get away

376
00:42:34,792 --> 00:42:41,042
with making that story about us
stick? We have to do something
about it. I am glad to say, we

377
00:42:41,042 --> 00:42:47,042
are. We are starting to
understand what the problem is.
Knowing is half the battle.

378
00:42:49,250 --> 00:42:55,250
Knowing is half the battle, we
are not understanding we have a
problem to deal with it. I have

379
00:42:59,125 --> 00:43:05,417
good news. We are starting to
get people out spreading the
news, actually changing the

380
00:43:05,417 --> 00:43:11,417
narrative. I love, got Evan
booth, Kaminski,
(indiscernible), Brian Krebs, a

381
00:43:11,417 --> 00:43:18,167
reporter is starting to tell the
accurate story about what's
going on. Also to mention, I

382
00:43:18,167 --> 00:43:21,708
love Dave Kennedy, you may have
seen him on fox news, CNN,
MSNBC, the Katie Couric show,

383
00:43:21,708 --> 00:43:27,708
every time I see him in real
life, I freak out. He needs one,
like one of those holographic

384
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:43,500
ones but these are great voices.
We like these voices, people
talking about, getting in the

385
00:43:45,750 --> 00:43:52,917
media and talking about hacking.
We like great speakers and
orators and knowledgeable

386
00:43:52,917 --> 00:44:00,292
hackers going out and talking on
television, maybe not everybody.
Maybe not everybody. Let's not

387
00:44:00,292 --> 00:44:06,083
get carried away. Not everybody
has to write narrative to go
with, not everybody is equipped

388
00:44:06,083 --> 00:44:12,083
to tell the story, but there's
quite a few, and my question, my
challenge to you, my biggest  ‑

389
00:44:18,042 --> 00:44:24,042
‑ seriously. This is what I
would like to see happen. Why
not you? You don't need a group.

390
00:44:27,792 --> 00:44:31,750
I am the Calvary. Great thing to
start and  ‑ ‑ you  ‑ ‑ news
stories happen and your local

391
00:44:31,750 --> 00:44:38,125
news covers it. Call your
newspaper, television show, if
you have information and can

392
00:44:38,125 --> 00:44:44,125
tell a good narrative in a way
people can understand, do it. Do
not try to pimp yourself out for

393
00:44:52,792 --> 00:44:59,292
PR, but educate the public.
That's what it's about. If you
are not here to try to learn to

394
00:44:59,292 --> 00:45:05,292
take it back, educate people to
be better, then you are wasting
your time here. We need to start

395
00:45:08,208 --> 00:45:13,792
educating outside of the echo
chamber, start communicating
with the people that don't know

396
00:45:13,792 --> 00:45:20,083
how to run computers, do a
[indiscernible], need to start
educating them, letting them

397
00:45:20,083 --> 00:45:26,083
know who we are. [Applause] >>
This is what we are getting to.
At 7:00 this morning, without

398
00:45:31,042 --> 00:45:37,000
any Pepsi, I am starting a
movement because it's a cool
thing to do. I don't have a

399
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:43,167
website out for it yet. No, I
haven't got a logo, but I stole
art from Google like everybody

400
00:45:43,167 --> 00:45:50,542
else. What I want is not a
group. I don't want an
organization. I don't want a

401
00:45:50,542 --> 00:45:58,458
whole bunch  ‑ ‑ I just want one
website with the simple thing,
instructions on how to talk to

402
00:45:58,458 --> 00:46:03,917
the press. Simple instructions
on how to talk with users.
That's it people, no meetings,

403
00:46:03,917 --> 00:46:11,750
no talks about it, nothing else,
but informational standpoint for
you to individually start trying

404
00:46:11,750 --> 00:46:17,750
to make a change in this place
and make it better. That's what
we need. We're so cynical, upset

405
00:46:20,792 --> 00:46:26,792
with the way things are. We're
so tired. You are not powerless.
You are not someone that just

406
00:46:31,542 --> 00:46:38,667
gets to sit on the sidelines,
make funny witty comments and
think it's funny. You have a

407
00:46:38,667 --> 00:46:44,667
responsibility to do something
about it. You are a hacker,
that's what we do. We do it

408
00:46:47,125 --> 00:46:53,125
freaking well. BloodKode started
here because one of our own
needed blood. What did we do? We

409
00:46:57,792 --> 00:47:03,792
created a blood drive at DEF
CON, first year, the lady of the
blood bank was in tears because

410
00:47:06,292 --> 00:47:12,292
it was from 9:00 to 5:00 on one
day. By 9:00 a.m. the slots were
all full, she had to spend the

411
00:47:14,417 --> 00:47:20,417
rest of the day turning people
away. The second year, we had it
for longer. Guess what? It was

412
00:47:23,333 --> 00:47:28,750
the biggest blood drive in
Nevada state history at the
time. The Ninja party was giving

413
00:47:28,750 --> 00:47:34,750
out invites that might have
helped. But it still happened.
What else occurred? The next

414
00:47:37,875 --> 00:47:43,875
year, last year, I gave no
prizes, there were no raffles,
no gimmicks, no nothing. The

415
00:47:48,875 --> 00:47:54,917
second largest blood drive in
Nevada state history at the
time. Guess what happened this

416
00:47:54,917 --> 00:48:00,917
year? Not too much. We had a
bus. Next year I will get in
trouble, announce what we are

417
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:09,333
going to try to do, which is a
bleeding edge track, have
speakers come in, in a room,

418
00:48:09,333 --> 00:48:14,625
have 30 minute sit down with the
actual people donating. You
actually get one-on-one time

419
00:48:14,625 --> 00:48:19,875
with different DEF CON speakers
and called it the bleeding edge
track. Hopefully, if I can get

420
00:48:19,875 --> 00:48:26,167
them ok with that but you know
it's better to ask for
forgiveness than permission, so

421
00:48:26,167 --> 00:48:33,625
I am already announcing it. I
want that to happen. Because I
want  ‑ ‑ recently, last year or

422
00:48:33,625 --> 00:48:39,125
so another company, UNC or
something, announcing the
biggest blood drive in the state

423
00:48:39,125 --> 00:48:45,708
history. That is not cool. It
should be hackers. People were
telling Julie, the blood drive,

424
00:48:45,708 --> 00:48:50,958
why are we doing this? What do I
tell them Jayson? Not just to
make computers better, but make

425
00:48:50,958 --> 00:48:56,958
the world better. This is a
great way to do it. That's what
we do. Stop trying to narrow it

426
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:09,500
down, make it about hackers and
computers, the network. That's
not what being a hacker is. It's

427
00:49:11,708 --> 00:49:17,708
not. There's also "be the
match," Tom Wilson helped get
the BloodKode 2 started, I

428
00:49:19,792 --> 00:49:25,792
dropped the ball. He did it
while he was working on Be the
Match. All that takes is to go

429
00:49:29,417 --> 00:49:34,625
to the contest, do a swab, you
are in Vegas, you put worse
things in your mouth this

430
00:49:34,625 --> 00:49:38,792
weekend. You can actually help
save a life. It's about saving
lives, making a change for the

431
00:49:38,792 --> 00:49:44,000
better, because we like doing
that. There we go. I am not
going to talk about hackers for

432
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:50,000
charity, I'm not talking about
Johnny Long, we know about
hackers for charity, we know

433
00:49:54,125 --> 00:50:00,125
about Johnny Long and the great
work he's doing. Who's that guy
in the middle? That's China

434
00:50:08,958 --> 00:50:14,958
Eagle, the Johnny Long of China.
He helps put computer systems in
schools in western rural China,

435
00:50:17,583 --> 00:50:23,583
help getting education out
there. He's doing great work in
his country to help his people.

436
00:50:26,792 --> 00:50:32,792
He's a humanitarian and a
patriot. He hates cybercrime. He
thinks most of the hackers,

437
00:50:34,875 --> 00:50:40,083
should be more nationalists,
political, helping their
country. A thing I like about

438
00:50:40,083 --> 00:50:48,000
that statement, Americans don't
realize, oh wait, there can be
patriots in other countries? I

439
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:55,875
am not sure how I feel about
that. Yes, we can't think about
hacking in a community unless we

440
00:50:55,875 --> 00:51:03,000
are thinking about a global
community. Hackers are everyone.
Borders shouldn't differentiate

441
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:09,000
us. It should be that we are
hackers and accepted. That's the
way it was before Instagram,

442
00:51:11,625 --> 00:51:17,292
before Twitter, you could see
the person you were talking to.
In the IRC days you assumed guys

443
00:51:17,292 --> 00:51:23,292
are guys, girls are guys, and 14
year olds are FBI agents. You
know, that's the way it was the

444
00:51:23,292 --> 00:51:29,292
olden days. Start doing that,
understanding we are a community
and can't just think hacking is

445
00:51:31,667 --> 00:51:35,042
based on borders, computers or 
‑ ‑ I have news for you. It's
starting to change. Hacking is

446
00:51:35,042 --> 00:51:41,167
about creativity. It is about
artistry, changing, inventing,
doing something new. These are

447
00:51:41,167 --> 00:51:47,042
some of the examples. You've got
Dual Core expressing, educating
vastness through his music.

448
00:51:47,042 --> 00:51:53,042
You've got Fab, actually
creating sewing machine programs
and hacking sewing machines to

449
00:51:59,833 --> 00:52:05,833
create knitting sweaters with QR
codes in them. You've got Eddie
the Yeti expressing and creating

450
00:52:08,875 --> 00:52:14,875
art, while still doing hacking,
yes, I am a hacker and this is
also what I can create. That's

451
00:52:18,625 --> 00:52:24,625
what hacking is. I also have
news for you. It's not just
that, that we have to change. I

452
00:52:26,792 --> 00:52:32,792
have news for you. As hackers
are breeding, we're creating
offspring. One of the proudest

453
00:52:36,750 --> 00:52:44,375
moments of my life was when I
was walking to my daughter's
school, a little girl comes up,

454
00:52:44,375 --> 00:52:50,375
my daughter looks up at me,
smiles, said this is my daddy,
he's a hacker. That's a great

455
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:57,417
warm story to tell and makes me
feel good. Until John
(indiscernible), in a class I

456
00:52:57,417 --> 00:53:04,500
took with him said he was at a
career day and his daughter said
"my daddy is a hacker." He said

457
00:53:04,500 --> 00:53:10,500
he got looks, people thought he
was a leper, a criminal. That
literally broke my heart. I

458
00:53:13,667 --> 00:53:19,667
didn't tell him. I was sitting
back there, I got so deflated
thinking about that. Someone had

459
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:30,000
to go through that, think their
child will look at them
different because of the people

460
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:37,125
around them are saying "oh, your
daddy is a hacker?" A hacker
stole my daddy's credit card, a

461
00:53:37,125 --> 00:53:43,125
hacker put a virus on my daddy's
computer. Is that the world we
want to live in? Our children

462
00:53:46,458 --> 00:53:51,250
shouldn't have to be ashamed of
what we do for a living, we are
helping people, we are trying to

463
00:53:51,250 --> 00:53:56,042
be a positive force in the
world. They shouldn't think
about us wearing a ski mask

464
00:53:56,042 --> 00:54:03,333
while we are on the computer. I
want you to understand it's not
just them we have to worry

465
00:54:03,333 --> 00:54:09,333
about. We like to think it's one
aspect, you don't get to learn
to be a hacker. You don't go to

466
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:19,083
training to be a hacker. You are
a hacker. As you are born, you
are a hacker, and you are not a

467
00:54:19,083 --> 00:54:25,083
special snowflake in the
blizzard. Look at this. A group
of kids in Ethiopia were given a

468
00:54:28,958 --> 00:54:34,958
crate that was unopened. Five
months later they hacked the
security settings and learned

469
00:54:37,042 --> 00:54:43,042
English and hacked the tablets.
Five year old kid wasn't allowed
in the Xbox account. Microsoft

470
00:54:46,583 --> 00:54:52,583
gave a reward because he found a
vulnerability in it. That's
hacking. This girl right here in

471
00:54:54,958 --> 00:55:01,833
the lower right, her grandfather
has Parkinson's, what did she
do? Designed a cup he could

472
00:55:01,833 --> 00:55:07,250
drink out of that's actually
getting ready to be mass
produced for all Parkinson's

473
00:55:07,250 --> 00:55:15,042
patients. She saw a problem and
tried to do something about it.
She's a hacker. It is not

474
00:55:15,042 --> 00:55:21,000
something special. It is in our
DNA, and until you start telling
the other people, stop trying to

475
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:26,458
be special and say you are as
much a hacker as I am, you are
just in a different field or not

476
00:55:26,458 --> 00:55:33,875
doing something with it, they
will keep looking at us as the
odd ones. Hacking is being

477
00:55:33,875 --> 00:55:39,875
human. Period. On a lighter
note, just remember we are a
community, through the power of

478
00:55:45,083 --> 00:55:51,083
awkward hugs we are one or two
degrees away from Kevin Bacon.
No matter where you are in the

479
00:55:51,083 --> 00:55:58,083
world, no matter where you live,
you are part of the community
that is bigger than you, that is

480
00:55:58,083 --> 00:56:02,208
bigger than your neighborhood,
bigger than your local hacking
group, bigger than this

481
00:56:02,208 --> 00:56:08,208
conference. You are connected to
the world, start acting like it.
[Applause] >> I have about one

482
00:56:26,958 --> 00:56:31,958
minute for questions, maybe it
some good ones or just troll me,
I can't care which. >> I have

483
00:56:31,958 --> 00:56:39,917
known you 10 years Jayson, and
followed your stuff on Twitter.
I wanted to tell everyone here

484
00:56:39,917 --> 00:56:45,917
that didn't see what went down
at Black Hat, I appreciate your
courage that, you took matters

485
00:56:47,917 --> 00:56:52,292
into your own hands and dealt
with something that was pretty
embarrassing in the community. I

486
00:56:52,292 --> 00:56:58,917
think for the benefit of
everyone you should tell the
story. >> I will tell the

487
00:56:58,917 --> 00:57:06,125
unedited version, showing I am
not that big of a hero. The
person that gets credit is Wendy

488
00:57:06,125 --> 00:57:12,125
451 on Twitter. She saw an
offensive disgusting sign at the
Black Hat booth area and she did

489
00:57:15,833 --> 00:57:20,208
the mature thing. You can't
fault me for not doing the
mature thing. I am not mature

490
00:57:20,208 --> 00:57:25,792
and I am upfront about that. She
did the mature thing and
actually went to Black Hat

491
00:57:25,792 --> 00:57:32,583
officials and said guys, not
cool, do something about it.
They did. Wendy 451 gets a lot

492
00:57:32,583 --> 00:57:39,250
of the props. I was in the hotel
room chilling and I saw the sign
that someone else had tweeted. I

493
00:57:39,250 --> 00:57:43,750
got in a rage. I won't describe
it. It was disgusting, it's out
there if you want to go look at

494
00:57:43,750 --> 00:57:49,750
it, it's horrible. I run down
there. I am like running down to
the lobby because I am doing

495
00:57:49,750 --> 00:57:54,625
something about this, I don't
know what yet but something. I
actually run into

496
00:57:54,625 --> 00:57:59,667
(indiscernible) walking and he's
like what are you doing? I am
going to go start a ruckus. I

497
00:57:59,667 --> 00:58:04,625
keep walking and he follows me a
little bit and realizes, crap,
he really is about to start a

498
00:58:04,625 --> 00:58:11,292
ruckus. I go to their booth,
registration area for Black Hat,
because I thought it would be

499
00:58:11,292 --> 00:58:19,250
good material, the sign, say
this is wrong with an arrow,
stand up out in front of the

500
00:58:19,250 --> 00:58:26,000
booth holding a sign saying this
is wrong. As I write it an
official from Black Hat comes up

501
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:30,250
and says what are you doing? I'm
about to start a ruckus. I like
to be honest. They are like you

502
00:58:30,250 --> 00:58:36,250
can't do that. I am like, yes, I
can. I am an attendee and I am
expressing my freedom of speech

503
00:58:39,667 --> 00:58:45,125
I am going to protest, I think
it's pretty crappy. They are
like no, you are not allowed to

504
00:58:45,125 --> 00:58:50,458
do this, this can't be done. I
pull out the phone, take a
picture, I have a daughter and

505
00:58:50,458 --> 00:58:53,375
he thinks this is okay. He is
like I have two daughters. You
think this is okay? They are

506
00:58:53,375 --> 00:58:59,375
like, well, you can't mess with
their freedom of speech; their
First Amendment rights. I'm

507
00:59:02,625 --> 00:59:06,208
like, I am not messing with
their First Amendment rights,
I'm not telling them to take it

508
00:59:06,208 --> 00:59:12,458
down, just expressing my
opinion. They are like – and
this is the beauty of it, if you

509
00:59:12,458 --> 00:59:17,000
do your First Amendment right we
will do our First Amendment
right and I'm like, what is

510
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:21,417
that? We're going to take you
and the sign out of the
conference. I'm like, dDo you

511
00:59:21,417 --> 00:59:27,667
understand how the First
Amendment works? Then there
were  ‑ ‑ okay, here comes  ‑ ‑

512
00:59:27,667 --> 00:59:35,042
I will finish the story and
leave. They are not  ‑ ‑ today,
fine, whatever. They said we

513
00:59:35,042 --> 00:59:41,042
will see about that. Walk off. I
didn't stand up to the thing, go
do that, I feel bad about

514
00:59:43,292 --> 00:59:49,292
myself, started walking, got
pissed, asked for the guy's
business card. He gives me his

515
00:59:53,917 --> 00:59:58,458
business card and asks, are you
interested in physical hardware?
I said no I think this is a

516
00:59:58,458 --> 01:00:04,083
disgusting advertisement.
Horrible booth, you should be
ashamed, and that that sign is

517
01:00:04,083 --> 01:00:10,958
better for selling condoms then
hardward. Goodbye, and I walked
away. That's all I did to it but

518
01:00:10,958 --> 01:00:16,958
that's the only thing I could
do. [Applause] >> That was that.
That was the drama. The drama

519
01:00:16,958 --> 01:00:22,750
has been taken care of. General
manager fixed it. Didn't know it
was there, they handled it

520
01:00:22,750 --> 01:00:26,958
responsibly once it was brought
to their attention. This guy is
actually coming over to tackle

521
01:00:26,958 --> 01:00:32,958
me so this talk is now
officially over. Thank you.
[Applause]
