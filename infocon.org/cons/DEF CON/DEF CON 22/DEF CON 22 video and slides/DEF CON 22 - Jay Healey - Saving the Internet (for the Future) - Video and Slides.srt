1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,420
>>We are going to kick this off
with Mr. Jay Healey, a member of
the Defcon approval team. And he

2
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:13,600
is going to talk about some big
picture stuff. I think this is
going to be a really, really

3
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:25,780
interesting talk. Yes, sir.
Well, I'm going to turn it over
to number 2 who has something.

4
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:37,660
>> Will you introduce the
speaker? >> So introduced. This
is Jay. Crowd. [applause] >> So, I'm

5
00:00:37,667 --> 00:00:43,667
hoping this talk isn't going to
be as lag as that video was, so
you, get, well, good, well,

6
00:00:49,792 --> 00:00:55,792
done. [laughter} Thanks. >>

7
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:04,120
Okay, so raise your hand if you
are a first-time speaker at

8
00:01:04,125 --> 00:01:11,917
Defcon. Hey! We have a winner.
We have a little tradition here
at Defcon. First-time speakers

9
00:01:11,917 --> 00:01:17,917
must do a shot on stage.
Congratulations! >> Thank you
everyone so much. >> [Applause] >>

10
00:01:26,667 --> 00:01:31,000
If you want to know how to be a
first-time speaker and be on the
CFP Review Board, the answer is

11
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:40,280
know the dark tangent, so. This
is a different kind of talk for DefCon
and frankly this is a different track.

12
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:44,740
So yes this is the party
room and this is the 
party track.

13
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:58,740
But, yeah woo! But the
DT wanted something
different. A new set of

14
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:07,720
themes introduced to Defcon and
if you read what was put in the
program it won't be a surprise

15
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:14,792
what he wrote in this year's
program. Last year the Dark
Tangent wrote in the program

16
00:02:14,792 --> 00:02:21,125
about how offense is
overwhelming the defense. And he
wrote in this years how this is

17
00:02:21,125 --> 00:02:29,583
leading to a sense of
helplessness. The Dark Tangent
and others has said we can't

18
00:02:29,583 --> 00:02:35,833
just submit ourselves to this
helplessness. We all need to be
part of the solution. And when

19
00:02:35,833 --> 00:02:42,493
he says 'hack with us', he's not
just saying take out your
computers and go have fun, he's

20
00:02:43,833 --> 00:02:51,042
saying we all need to own part
of the solution. So a lot of the
talks you are seeing in track 1

21
00:02:51,042 --> 00:02:58,742
are about that. How can we get
our legs behind responsibility
or at least reasonableness and

22
00:02:59,875 --> 00:03:05,667
make things better, because
they're not. And so that is what
this talk is going to be about,

23
00:03:05,667 --> 00:03:13,875
so. And the reason he asked me
to do this talk and be part of
the CFP Review Board is, there

24
00:03:13,875 --> 00:03:19,625
are all sorts of great efforts
happening in this. Uhm, mine
happens to be I work for a DC

25
00:03:19,625 --> 00:03:25,083
think tank. We tend to do
national security issues. So a
lot of the other talks might be

26
00:03:25,083 --> 00:03:31,417
from I Am The Calvary to the EFF
and they have their own legs in
this. Ours is to look at the

27
00:03:31,417 --> 00:03:37,125
national security lane. And look
at the big picture. I have been
part of the community, first

28
00:03:37,125 --> 00:03:43,042
came to DefCon 9, was with
military signals intelligence.
Did some offense, mostly

29
00:03:43,042 --> 00:03:50,380
defense. Created the first
military joint cyber war
fighting unit in 1998. Set up

30
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:56,375
security in one of the big
investment banks, went to the
White House and was a director

31
00:03:56,375 --> 00:04:02,417
of cyber policy for the
president giving advise on these
issues. So now I'm in a think

32
00:04:02,417 --> 00:04:08,417
tank so I get to write and talk
on these issues. Wanted to start
out with a movie, anyone know

33
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:22,875
what movie this is? Uhm, yes.
That's from Zoolander. What's
happening here. It's Gas

34
00:04:22,875 --> 00:04:30,458
Fighter! Who said it first...
come on. Come up here you get a
free book. I wrote it last year.

35
00:04:30,458 --> 00:04:36,667
It's a history of cyber
conflict. Kind of a military
history of cyber space. This is

36
00:04:36,667 --> 00:04:44,208
the gas fight in Zoolander. And
I wanted to lead off with this
mostly because I wanted you guys

37
00:04:44,208 --> 00:04:51,167
to be interested and what's
cooler, gas fights are cool. So
what happens in the gas fight

38
00:04:51,167 --> 00:04:57,167
scene? >>[off mic] >> 

39
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:03,417
Yeah, these moron, male models
right... my former colleagues

40
00:05:03,417 --> 00:05:09,583
right but. So they are driving in
this convertible and they think
it's going to be so much fun

41
00:05:09,583 --> 00:05:17,250
splashing each other with
gasoline, and they are hosing
each other down. And you know

42
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:22,875
it's funny, because you know you
don't play with gasoline. And
you know where this is going to

43
00:05:22,875 --> 00:05:29,792
end up. You know this is going
to end up really freaking badly.
And of course a couple minutes

44
00:05:29,792 --> 00:05:34,417
into the scene one of them
glamorously takes out a
cigarettes and paboom. And the

45
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:42,157
whole thing blows up. You know
it's funny because you know
what's coming. What bothers me

46
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:49,240
so much about this field we are
in right now, is that all of us
knows, in this room, in Blackhat

47
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:56,000
before this, in Washington DC,
at Ft. Meade with cyber commands
in NSA, in Moscow, in Beijing. I

48
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,840
think we all know we are
covering ourselves with
gasoline. We are playing with

49
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:11,540
gasoline. That we are all just
coating ourselves in gas. And
it's not funny, we all know

50
00:06:11,542 --> 00:06:19,125
what's going to happen. From the
research we did for the book, I
can't find anything about anyone

51
00:06:19,125 --> 00:06:29,000
really dying from an online
attack. But, we know it's
coming. And worse, a lot of the

52
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:36,167
people that are busiest spraying
with gasoline are saying watch
out because this is going to be

53
00:06:36,167 --> 00:06:43,833
dangerous. General Alexander,
the cyber command folks. It was
funny when the models did it,

54
00:06:43,833 --> 00:06:49,833
they were just going blow
themselves up, but the world is
relying on this stuff that we

55
00:06:51,833 --> 00:06:59,213
built on the internet,
cyberspace. So the folks
involved in the gas fight aren't

56
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:08,917
just burning themselves, their
going to burn all of us. What I
think is very much missed when

57
00:07:08,917 --> 00:07:13,250
I'm talking in Washington DC,
it's our job to go around and
talk to some of these

58
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:20,750
Washington, DC policy makers,
pentagon, up at Ft. Meade, White
House. THe debate is all about

59
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:27,042
cyber this, cyber that, cyber
the other thing. And I always
have to remind folks that the

60
00:07:27,042 --> 00:07:32,125
internet is the most
transformative thing that's
coming out of human brains for

61
00:07:32,125 --> 00:07:37,875
650 years. Since Guetenberg
invented the printing press.
Yeah, electrical power is pretty

62
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:45,333
impressive too. We will give the
internet the top 2 or 3 alright.
The most transformative

63
00:07:45,333 --> 00:07:52,792
technology as we as human
beings, all together have done.
Because of the printing press,

64
00:07:52,792 --> 00:08:00,125
it gave us the renaissance and
the enlightenment and all of the
ideals. The real scientific

65
00:08:00,125 --> 00:08:05,750
methods, the Declaration of
Independence, all of this
wonderful art and science and

66
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:12,500
rationality that came out of
that. But imagine if 20 years
after Guentenberg invented the

67
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:19,667
printing press, it turns out the
Pope, the Princes of Europe,
pretty much anyone that cared

68
00:08:19,667 --> 00:08:24,958
could know what was being
printed, exactly who was
printing it, exactly who they

69
00:08:24,958 --> 00:08:33,758
were passing it to. Of course we
can say that violates privacy,
civil liberties, we can argue if

70
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:40,833
it's legal and constitutional,
and people will. But I think
that might be missing a larger

71
00:08:40,833 --> 00:08:47,583
point. If you couldn't rely on
that underlying communication
mechanism, you probably don't

72
00:08:47,583 --> 00:08:54,667
get the renaissance, and you
probably don't get the
enlightenment. You've changed

73
00:08:54,667 --> 00:09:01,000
the trajectory of humanity - not
for 5 years or 50 but for 500
years. And you've probably

74
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:07,375
changed the trajectory of
humanity from then to every
generation for when humans are

75
00:09:07,375 --> 00:09:14,955
in the universe. So, we know how
important the internet is. We
know the threats it's facing.

76
00:09:16,667 --> 00:09:21,208
So what I want to try and get
across in this talk is to get
together and bring across in

77
00:09:21,208 --> 00:09:27,458
this track is maybe these
threats are more existential
than we think. Maybe privacy

78
00:09:27,458 --> 00:09:36,498
isn't the main thing at risk
here? So of course we can argue
we've been pushing too far

79
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:42,583
national security and spying and
the cult of the offense and
that's outweighing privacy and

80
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:51,363
civil liberty's. So, who's a
Douglas Adam's fan? Alright, you
got it first. You get a book.

81
00:09:55,333 --> 00:10:01,167
I'll sign it afterwards. Yeah,
that's someone else's problem.
In DC I say I don't care about

82
00:10:01,167 --> 00:10:06,750
privacy and civil liberties. Of
course I do. I know Jennifer
Granick has that... ah, there's

83
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:14,167
ACLU, there's a lot of folks
that are going to to worry about
that. Others have that voice. My

84
00:10:14,167 --> 00:10:22,747
job in DC is to say, maybe we
are making tradeoffs today's
national security at the risk of

85
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:27,417
our digital economy, our digital
future and these future
trajectories. Because I can't

86
00:10:27,417 --> 00:10:34,333
walk into a 4 star general or
the White House and start
talking about privacy or civil

87
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:40,083
liberties. It seems muling. And
you have generals from a
militarized cyber power, which I

88
00:10:40,083 --> 00:10:46,750
came from - right? I'm an
insider to this, and if you go
into these hardcore trying to

89
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:51,000
protect Americans from
terrorists, you're not going to
win this by talking about

90
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:56,708
privacy and civil liberties. If
you say this is a stupid
national security and why, you

91
00:10:56,708 --> 00:11:04,542
would have a better case. The
argument I'm trying to warm them
up for is, we're making trade

92
00:11:04,542 --> 00:11:12,042
offs for today's security and
the internet as a whole and in
fact our trade offs now between

93
00:11:12,042 --> 00:11:18,958
security and the future
possibilities till the end of human
kind. And so I try to hit them

94
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:28,333
with the punch line, is that,
when I hear people in
Washington, DC folks say, well,

95
00:11:28,333 --> 00:11:33,958
why should we stop if nobody
else is going to stop. When I
say, well maybe the future is

96
00:11:33,958 --> 00:11:38,583
going to look very different.
they say, no, no, no... it's
going to be fine. Now how do we

97
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:47,203
know that. How do we make these
tradeoffs. Whether it's in this
community with security

98
00:11:47,208 --> 00:11:52,458
researchers, hackers and the
rest. In DC, the policy
community, everywhere in between

99
00:11:52,458 --> 00:11:58,292
and all the other capitals. How
do we make these tradeoffs so
security is better now so that

100
00:11:58,292 --> 00:12:04,375
we're not going to miss out on
future renaissance and
enlightens, if all of us keep

101
00:12:04,375 --> 00:12:10,375
pissing in the pool. So, I say
'saving cyberspace'. What
do I mean by that. It's great

102
00:12:14,958 --> 00:12:20,042
when you do history because it
gives you all the other slides,
things people have come up with.

103
00:12:20,042 --> 00:12:27,542
this is a slide from 1997, a
defense science board. I love
this, it's kind of if you go to

104
00:12:27,542 --> 00:12:36,292
a threat talk. People are going
to be doing this range. You get
the evil hackers that you know

105
00:12:36,292 --> 00:12:41,958
you'll hit with low potential
damage, all the way up to state
sponsored and not that much has

106
00:12:41,958 --> 00:12:47,958
changed since 1997, >> [laughter] >>,
except maybe who is state sponsor,
and for you young ones. That is

107
00:12:51,333 --> 00:13:01,653
Sudam Husain in the upper left.
If DC21 was your first one you
might remember this. But also,

108
00:13:01,667 --> 00:13:08,125
when I'm talking about trying to
save cyberspace, it's not just
about those kinds of threats. If

109
00:13:08,125 --> 00:13:18,792
some of you went to BH and heard
Jeff Moss kick off at BH, he
asked the group and asked how

110
00:13:18,792 --> 00:13:24,000
many people think we're going to
keep adding complexity to the
system. And, pretty much

111
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:30,750
everyone raised their hands. And
then he asked how many silly
chuckle heads think that there's

112
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:35,000
gong to be some limit to
complexity. I think I was the
only one that raised my hand.

113
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:40,208
Because he was asking if we
think we will regulate or
legislate and keep adding

114
00:13:40,208 --> 00:13:48,458
complexity. And I think, I was
in the finance sector, I know
from 2008. that if you keep

115
00:13:48,458 --> 00:13:54,792
adding complexity to the system
and don't understand it, it can
all come crashing down. And what

116
00:13:54,792 --> 00:14:00,667
we might end up with, that looks
very different. So one of the
things I want to leave this

117
00:14:00,667 --> 00:14:06,708
audience with is, be thinking of
those discontinuities. The
future may look very, very

118
00:14:06,708 --> 00:14:13,708
different for good or for ill.
And Dan Geer is one of my
favorite folks, he passes gas

119
00:14:13,708 --> 00:14:21,125
and my IQ goes up about 5
points, he has this quote I
love. "As society becomes more

120
00:14:21,125 --> 00:14:27,958
technologic, even the mundane
comes to depend on distant
digital perfection." So the same

121
00:14:27,958 --> 00:14:34,833
time we are connecting
everything to the internet, when
we are most worried about the

122
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:40,333
offense running away. And so we
need to be thinking of those
longer trends. One of my

123
00:14:40,333 --> 00:14:48,713
favorite quotes when I did the
book, which is in the bookstore,
"Few if any contemporary

124
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:54,200
security controls can stop a
dedicated red team. We know
that, you're going to be hearing

125
00:14:54,208 --> 00:15:05,333
that all the time, everywhere.
This quote is from 1979. Lt.
Colonel Rogers, US Air Force,

126
00:15:05,333 --> 00:15:08,973
was the father of the rainbow
series of manuals. You know, the
red book, the orange book the

127
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:15,792
blue book... 1979. What he's
actually saying here is the
attackers had the advantage.

128
00:15:15,792 --> 00:15:23,292
Offense has had the advantage
over the defense since 1979.
Before Defcon, since before

129
00:15:23,292 --> 00:15:32,992
there was really an internet. So
if you do defense, if you are an
internet security guy, what the

130
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:40,958
fuck are we doing? When I'm a
glass half emptied, I say
nothing I have done has

131
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:47,500
mattered. The billions that
we've spent, all the patents that
we've done, all the vulms that

132
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:55,167
you've discovered has been
wasted. Now when I'm a glass
half full, I at least say we are

133
00:15:55,167 --> 00:16:00,958
keeping up. The attackers are
better, but at least they
haven't ran away with the field

134
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:07,000
yet. In Biology they called this
the Red Queen affect. From Alice
in Wonderland, you have to keep

135
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:12,208
running faster just to stay in
place. But how long can a system
stay in place? Keep it's balance

136
00:16:12,208 --> 00:16:19,848
year after year, decade after
decade. With one side have a
persistent advantage and gain.

137
00:16:21,167 --> 00:16:28,458
And that system can stay in
balance. At some point you have
to think this can change. So,

138
00:16:28,458 --> 00:16:34,250
I'm a military guy. A lot of
military history and it doesn't
have to stay that way. That one

139
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:38,333
side has the advantage all the
time, it doesn't have to stay
that way. In human conflicts

140
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:42,792
since we first started, we
picked up stone and stick to one
another. The balance between

141
00:16:42,792 --> 00:16:51,112
offense and defense changes all
of the time. Except maybe
nuclear and space. You know

142
00:16:51,125 --> 00:16:55,750
riding a pony on a calvary and
the offense would have the
advantage until they meant mass

143
00:16:55,750 --> 00:17:03,350
range of fire and then machine
guns. It goes back and forth all
the time. We can imagine this can change.

144
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:10,375
we can imagine that we can
flip this so the defender can
have the advantage So,

145
00:17:10,375 --> 00:17:18,635
there is good news. We know
security is getting better. We know
there are places where we make a difference.

146
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:26,380
Unfortunately we also
know that the bad guys
are running away

147
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:32,700
with the field. I love this Dan
Geer quote, 'We're racking up
personal bests but the bad

148
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:35,000
guys are setting world records.

149
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,875
But maybe it's not just a simple
straight line that the bad buys
are getting better than us.

150
00:17:38,875 --> 00:17:43,500
Maybe they are getting better
exponentially than we are. So,
I've heard some people make that

151
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:54,240
case. So where, do we hit that
tipping point. When there's more
predators than prey. Especially

152
00:17:54,250 --> 00:18:00,125
when it turns out governments
seem to be trying to be the most
efficient and veracious predator

153
00:18:00,125 --> 00:18:04,680
instead of protecting us from
the others and being prey. So
now you hear a lot of moaning

154
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:10,960
in Washington DC about how
it's the Wild West. But the Wild
West isn't the worst of things. 

155
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:21,360
The government likes it because
they've got the best posse. Right now attackers have advantage.

156
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:32,333
You can imagine a place where
the attackers have supremacy,
every time online strategy,

157
00:18:32,333 --> 00:18:39,533
there's some asshole with an
AK47 or machine gun on back of
pickup truck rolls by. It might

158
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:48,160
be Somalia, a stable state,
where every time we try and get
our act together we get dragged

159
00:18:48,167 --> 00:19:00,020
down. When I get asked for
saving, I ask about saving for whom.
In security there's no time horizon to it.

160
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:06,780
most of us do incident response
where time horizon is, how hell
get serve back online,

161
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:13,740
forensics. We live on a timeline
of, at best, a couple of hours,
a couple of days, a couple of

162
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:23,125
weeks ahead. In D.C., saying a
sustainable Internet. We need to
make sure that it's not going on

163
00:19:23,125 --> 00:19:29,375
just going to be there for us in
2014. If we want our kids and
grandkids and their grandkids to

164
00:19:29,375 --> 00:19:36,833
have a free Internet, an open
Internet and resilient an
awesome Internet, we need to

165
00:19:36,833 --> 00:19:45,833
start thinking now. That fits in
with privacy. There's a lot of
good efforts to try to add that

166
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:54,700
time horizon. When I think,
generation or grandparents
generation, some in the back

167
00:19:54,708 --> 00:20:03,400
great grandparents' generation,
they thought the natural direction of
technology, jetpacks, vacation

168
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:10,375
on the moon and Mars. Why
wouldn't we? That's the national
direction that the technology is

169
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:16,958
taking us. So of course we are
going to have those things in a
couple of decades. It reminds me

170
00:20:16,958 --> 00:20:23,667
of e‑Voting. In the mid‑90's,
electronic voting, Internet
voting, that's going to happen

171
00:20:23,667 --> 00:20:30,958
and give us a new democracy.
Where is it? There's all of
these possibilities, all of

172
00:20:30,958 --> 00:20:38,583
these technical possibilities
that we're not going to get
because we can't secure it.

173
00:20:38,583 --> 00:20:46,800
Smart Grid Internet of things
under so much of this unlock
embedded medical devices. If we

174
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:52,792
don't unlock the security
component. I'm afraid we're
going to look at D.C. 42 and

175
00:20:52,792 --> 00:20:58,458
look back 20 years and say can
you imagine that we thought we
were going to have those cars.

176
00:20:58,458 --> 00:21:05,125
Good thing we chopped them up
and proved how insecure they
were, or whatever technology.

177
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:13,540
We're not going to get what we
can unlock with these
technologies. When it comes to

178
00:21:13,542 --> 00:21:20,042
solution, to me the only vision,
if you care about the future of
the Internet is to flip this

179
00:21:20,042 --> 00:21:28,302
around, to get defense better
than offense. So the ass holes
have the harder job '. What we

180
00:21:28,302 --> 00:21:35,840
want is to get defense better
and superior. We have
the supremacy. So, I'll talk

181
00:21:42,167 --> 00:21:47,340
about how I'm helping and some
of my programs. Of course I will
talk about how you guys might be

182
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:54,833
able to help. First you've got
to believe that it's possible.
In Washington D.C., I come

183
00:21:54,833 --> 00:21:59,208
across very few people that
think that the defense can ever
get better than the offense.

184
00:21:59,208 --> 00:22:08,167
They've given up hope. The DT
wrote in this program, if we
accept defense as futile, offense

185
00:22:08,167 --> 00:22:16,042
wins, we all stop trying as
hard. I can see this very much
in Washington D.C. if we don't

186
00:22:16,042 --> 00:22:23,458
think defense can get better,
then there's no reason for us to
restrain our own offense. We

187
00:22:23,458 --> 00:22:29,333
might as well be the biggest,
baddest player in government,
because everybody else is going

188
00:22:29,333 --> 00:22:34,750
to do and we've got nothing to
lose. So you have to care and
think that you've got something

189
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:43,042
that can contribute to this.
Especially joining. Your time,
your brain, your patience. I

190
00:22:43,042 --> 00:22:48,667
will talk about each one of
those. Your time, there's so
many great groups that are out

191
00:22:48,667 --> 00:22:54,208
there, whether that's EFF,
whether that's I Am The Calvary,
that's trying to get out and

192
00:22:54,208 --> 00:23:00,875
saying we as security researchers
haven't done everything. We can't
keep releasing this stuff

193
00:23:00,875 --> 00:23:06,292
knowing that it's not going to
get fixed correctly. We have to
start feeling some ownership

194
00:23:06,292 --> 00:23:15,672
over the results. The D T talks
about that in the program. Or
dedicating your time to some of

195
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:24,200
the volunteer efforts. Join so
many other open source efforts.
We might not have to go through

196
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:30,200
heartbleed. If we had more time,
volunteer and monies and evolved
in a lot of the open‑source

197
00:23:30,208 --> 00:23:37,167
projects out there. World is
pretty much depending on us to
get this straight. We have to

198
00:23:37,167 --> 00:23:44,458
feel some ownership for that.
Patience, if you are a vuln
researcher. We know the first

199
00:23:44,458 --> 00:23:52,333
time you go to a company and
say, I found a vuln, they might
just brush you off. Have some

200
00:23:52,333 --> 00:24:00,733
patience with them. We need to
try and keep ‑‑ we need to have
some patience, even when people

201
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:09,625
don't understand what it is that
we're trying to do. Last is
always trying to measure. I come

202
00:24:09,625 --> 00:24:14,167
across this with security
research as well. Folks that say
we need Washington D.C. to

203
00:24:14,167 --> 00:24:19,583
understand the importance of
what we do so that they don't
criminalize the kinds of things

204
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:26,667
that we do. That's a great
panel, if you see something, say
something should apply to our

205
00:24:26,667 --> 00:24:33,917
field too, and we shouldn't run
into the CFAA and other laws.
The stuff that we're doing

206
00:24:33,917 --> 00:24:44,077
really matters. What you are
doing as vuln researchers. To
me, when I say how do you know

207
00:24:44,083 --> 00:24:48,500
as a security research community
that you're making a positive
difference? That you're helping

208
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:58,833
the defense more than you're
helping the offense? I get anecdotes,
there is this one time, and I knew

209
00:24:58,833 --> 00:25:08,413
this guy, and the role of
importance that we're traveling
in society in the digital future

210
00:25:08,417 --> 00:25:14,125
and we're all trying to build
together, we need to move past
anecdotes and showing the

211
00:25:14,125 --> 00:25:20,125
difference that we make.
Anecdotes aren't going to cut it
anymore. Obviously, not everyone

212
00:25:22,333 --> 00:25:26,292
is going to measure. No everyone
can feel ownership. No everyone
is going to want to dive into

213
00:25:26,292 --> 00:25:33,292
this. There's a lot of great
efforts and ways you can dive.
What I am doing in Washington

214
00:25:33,292 --> 00:25:39,292
D.C. is policy makers, push the
idea of sustainable cyber space.
Defense is better than office.

215
00:25:46,375 --> 00:25:52,625
The way to do that is to try to
work on the scale. Have them
succeed a million times or a

216
00:25:52,625 --> 00:25:58,208
billion times, and you will see
some of that coming up in this
track in this room today. For

217
00:25:58,208 --> 00:26:02,750
example, I'm interested
multi-compilers - in things
where we can take away entire

218
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:09,458
classes of attacks that no longer
succeed, instead of just trying
to always patch and being

219
00:26:09,458 --> 00:26:17,125
behind the bad guys. I'm trying to
convince D.C. that they are not as
much of the solution as they think

220
00:26:17,125 --> 00:26:23,375
they are. That there's nine
players on the ball field. We
don't need one general running

221
00:26:23,375 --> 00:26:27,542
around every where running
around saying, I got it. I got
it. There are many that can be

222
00:26:27,542 --> 00:26:35,742
close to the ball and make the
play. If they're allowed to, or
they're allowed to, maybe they

223
00:26:35,742 --> 00:26:39,417
can't see the ball well enough.
Maybe they need a better glove
have glove. Maybe they need to

224
00:26:39,417 --> 00:26:45,875
be reminded they are on the
field. That's how I was when I
was playing baseball as a kid.

225
00:26:45,875 --> 00:26:53,042
[Laughter]. But pushing this as
a private sector, not saying the
private sector doesn't have its

226
00:26:53,042 --> 00:26:57,958
own problems. I'm tired of
hearing in Washington D.C. that
the private sector is the

227
00:26:57,958 --> 00:27:07,658
problem. Last, or I'm trying to
push hard in D.C. for a single
strategy right now we have

228
00:27:07,667 --> 00:27:12,500
three strategies for the
Internet. The state department
talks all about Internet

229
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:19,208
freedom. They get involved in "I
can" and some of those issues. You
have department of commerce get

230
00:27:19,208 --> 00:27:27,083
involved, good broad band. They
vaguely own the I K
relationship. They're focused in

231
00:27:27,083 --> 00:27:33,958
on those issues. And of course
you have the military and
espionage. If you have three

232
00:27:33,958 --> 00:27:41,292
different strategies in your
life, tough when you have
competing priorities. Our

233
00:27:41,292 --> 00:27:46,792
leadership in D.C. needs to
understand that right now
whenever there's a competition

234
00:27:46,792 --> 00:27:52,042
between these priorities,
between the military and
espionage tend to be winning

235
00:27:52,042 --> 00:27:58,542
out. They have the most money
and the post competence. They
have the best lawyers willing to

236
00:27:58,542 --> 00:28:05,290
get T S. The lest bureaucratic
friction. We need to change that
around. I'm going to try and

237
00:28:05,292 --> 00:28:12,292
help break that. The tagline is
going to be prosperity first and
foremost. Thinking about how can

238
00:28:12,292 --> 00:28:17,042
we make sure the Internet is
going to be there? I do think
distruptive technology as has

239
00:28:17,042 --> 00:28:23,042
its place. This is a point I
made more rat pack than here. We
have community vendors that have

240
00:28:25,042 --> 00:28:32,125
a new box, script and software
for a particular solution and we
keep adding complexity on type

241
00:28:32,125 --> 00:28:38,500
of the complexity, so disruptive
technologies can work, but they
have to be the kind of

242
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:48,740
technology that works at scale.
Thank you very much. (Applause).
So that gives more time for

243
00:28:51,083 --> 00:28:58,792
shots and for Q and A. I think
Bob, who is running the room, go
to the mic so we can make sure

244
00:28:58,792 --> 00:29:05,272
we get it on the video. I will
go to my right. If you are all
buying me shots, try and

245
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:13,080
coordinate on the same kind of
alcohol. [Laughter]. >> So a
question is whether or not we're

246
00:29:13,083 --> 00:29:18,792
asking the right question.
Defense or offense. The first
thing you learn in the military

247
00:29:18,792 --> 00:29:26,458
history is a doctrine that says
anybody that does merely defense
is inevitably going to lose the

248
00:29:26,458 --> 00:29:33,750
battle or the war. We've stuck
with this for a long time. We
have issues about realtime

249
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:41,583
engagement. That seems to be
shifting with the cyber command
starting to attack some of the

250
00:29:41,583 --> 00:29:52,000
nation's data base, APT teams.
So I think that the entire
formula changes once you start

251
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:58,917
going with offense yourself.
It's the offense that's
attacking you, and you can also,

252
00:29:58,917 --> 00:30:06,708
to use an example from military
history, do what China always
did, don't try to stop them at

253
00:30:06,708 --> 00:30:12,708
the perimeter. Let them come in
and exhaust resource to take
over. There's all kinds of ways

254
00:30:12,708 --> 00:30:20,292
to create resource exhaustion.
>> Certainly, we want to change
the work factor between the

255
00:30:20,292 --> 00:30:29,832
offense and defense. One way to
raise it is to try and disrupt
them. Im a fan of when I'm in my

256
00:30:29,833 --> 00:30:35,750
moments that says an armed
society is a polite society. I'm
not convinced that we get

257
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:43,583
at‑scale defense better by
attacking them. Defense doesn't
have to be hard. We just suck at

258
00:30:43,583 --> 00:30:47,917
it. One of the reasons, now, why
the Department of Defense is
being more authentically minded

259
00:30:47,917 --> 00:30:56,197
is they can't defend their own
systems. I am not a fan of
saying, as an enterprise, as an

260
00:30:56,208 --> 00:31:00,792
individual corporate enterprise
or as an armed military with
uniformed people with an

261
00:31:00,792 --> 00:31:08,083
American flag patch on their
shoulder saying we should that
we should do disruptive attacks

262
00:31:08,083 --> 00:31:14,083
because we are not good at
defense. It has a role. I'm
cyber war fare, cyber, cyber,

263
00:31:14,083 --> 00:31:22,660
cyber, so it got a role, but
we're defaulting to it because
we suck at defense. That pisses

264
00:31:22,667 --> 00:31:30,042
me off. We got to go back and
forth. I'll be outside here. >>
The technology we should be

265
00:31:30,042 --> 00:31:38,820
develop, this, you have any
particular recommendation? Are
we thinking large scale? Should

266
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:46,160
we look at very sophisticated
intelligent, automated analysis
of code, before it gets deployed

267
00:31:46,167 --> 00:31:52,250
to? What do you feel is the best
way forward that we can help
develop? >> It's a great

268
00:31:52,250 --> 00:31:58,625
question. Some of you guys that
are closer to the technology
than I've gotten in D.C. can

269
00:31:58,625 --> 00:32:04,375
have better answer. The kinds of
things we can taken tire class
of attack. I'm not convinced the

270
00:32:04,375 --> 00:32:13,415
inspection for that. If the
world's ISP run as cleanly as
Scandinavian ISP, we would have

271
00:32:13,417 --> 00:32:24,217
a lot less problems. We would
have a lot fewer problems. I'm
interested in ‑‑ we've got a

272
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:28,160
couple of other talks that will
be in this track that are
hitting that, I think, focussing

273
00:32:28,167 --> 00:32:35,083
on ISP's. It doesn't have to be
technology. It's ownership and a
willingness for responsibility

274
00:32:35,083 --> 00:32:42,375
to no longer pass the trash.
It's not crazy in Washington D.C.
to talk about zero nuclear weapons.

275
00:32:42,375 --> 00:32:48,750
even if we know we can't get there.
I like to set goals that we can
get to zero botnets. If we

276
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:57,708
said everybody come to the table
and try to get buttons out of
the systems, we could do it. One

277
00:32:57,708 --> 00:33:02,500
of the reasons I'm here is to
find out what are some of these
other changes of attacks that

278
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:11,920
will ‑‑ I'm sorry, attacks that
we can just take out whether
it's... >> If you are interested

279
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:20,040
in getting the private sector,
how are you incentivize the
public to security over

280
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:26,040
functionality? >> That's a great
question. One is to look that
we've got different parts of the

281
00:33:26,042 --> 00:33:31,750
private sector. Washington D.C.
tends to paint ‑‑ there's a
couple of things that I would

282
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:37,042
do. One I would want the department
of home land security to set up a
program of grants. You can take

283
00:33:37,042 --> 00:33:42,542
$10 million dollars to look at
group like open source
vulnerability database. These

284
00:33:42,542 --> 00:33:51,162
groups that are actually on the
ball‑field and making the plays
and making due with $10,000 a

285
00:33:51,167 --> 00:33:55,750
year. So, one, let's find out
who is playing on the field. Who
is close to the ball and help

286
00:33:55,750 --> 00:34:03,333
them out. Two, this is if I
were DHS in the White House, I
would be convincing Warren

287
00:34:03,333 --> 00:34:10,417
Buffet and ‑‑ these people that
are shareholders in the
companies that are making these

288
00:34:10,417 --> 00:34:17,250
bad‑risk decisions. We still see
Washington D.C. say we to have
convince the system

289
00:34:17,250 --> 00:34:23,083
administrators or chief
information officers to do the
right thing. Screw that. In

290
00:34:23,083 --> 00:34:29,292
American style capitalism, it's
the shareholders at the end of
the day holding the risk. They

291
00:34:29,292 --> 00:34:34,250
own the company. The board
directors are representing them.
I say don't let the government

292
00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:39,250
try to convince the board
directors, go to the
shareholders. Before Y2K, the

293
00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:49,542
California pension retirement
system, $250 billion went to all
of their companies and said, how

294
00:34:49,542 --> 00:34:56,880
are you getting ready for Y2K?
Let's get Warren Buffet and say
I'm not going to invest unless

295
00:34:56,880 --> 00:35:01,958
they are getting cyber security
right. We have a couple of ideas
we can incentivize using

296
00:35:01,958 --> 00:35:13,698
process. We can talk about later.
>> Earlier you said that when
you tell the military to obey

297
00:35:13,708 --> 00:35:19,542
the laws in the United States,
it seems muling, and in your
response write will you said the

298
00:35:19,542 --> 00:35:26,240
shareholders of the corporation
hold the board of directors
responsible and do what they do.

299
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:32,240
What good is all of your policy
and talking if the United States
military will not obey the laws

300
00:35:32,250 --> 00:35:40,300
that exist? Aren't your words
just weak aren't you just dust
of nothing if Clapper and

301
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:44,200
Alexander Congress, lie to us >>
I'm not saying ‑‑ >> Of nothing,
if Clapper and Alexander lie to

302
00:35:44,208 --> 00:35:50,375
Congress, lie to the court and
us. Shouldn't we start with
accountability at the type

303
00:35:50,375 --> 00:35:57,917
instead of creating a bunch of
tracks in the dessert. >> It's a
mix. All of us, from whatever

304
00:35:57,917 --> 00:36:05,500
angle we're trying to take, have
the decks stacked against us.
I'm not saying I'm coming with

305
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:11,458
the strongest argument. I am
coming with an argument that is
more likely to win in Washington

306
00:36:11,458 --> 00:36:19,250
D.C. So I came out probably a
year ago now and said General
Alexander, forced to retire

307
00:36:19,250 --> 00:36:26,500
earlier. We need to separate at
least the leadership of NSA and
cyber command as a start. We've

308
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:33,583
got to start from that. And it
ended up that the ‑‑ the
president made other decisions

309
00:36:33,583 --> 00:36:41,417
on that. When I came out with
that piece, I had people all
over Washington D.C. saying, you

310
00:36:41,417 --> 00:36:47,625
can't use my name with this. But
good job. Don't tell anyone I
said this. So there is a

311
00:36:47,625 --> 00:36:51,417
groundswell of folks who said we
have been going in this
direction and it's not

312
00:36:51,417 --> 00:36:58,333
necessarily the right direction.
Folks that say, let's talk to
four‑star generals that have

313
00:36:58,333 --> 00:37:04,542
said, how we got where we are is
like a French Post painter like
Georges Seurat. The guy that

314
00:37:04,542 --> 00:37:10,422
make all the dots on the canvas.
We never stepped back to look at
the painting that we were

315
00:37:10,422 --> 00:37:16,458
actually making, especially the
way others saw. I'm not saying
we're going to have an easy

316
00:37:16,458 --> 00:37:22,375
time, but there's a lot of folks
that believe the way that I do
in Washington D.C. that think

317
00:37:22,375 --> 00:37:29,583
we're badly off track. It's a
part of my job. In fact the
DarkTangent job, senior

318
00:37:29,583 --> 00:37:37,583
associated with my program.
We're out trying to make this
case. We'll try and, we'll tell

319
00:37:37,583 --> 00:37:47,040
you next year how we're doing.
>> Alexander and Clapper in jail. >>
How do we take the example of

320
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:56,540
Switzerland as a nation state
defense great e than offense in
history, cure the apathy, to

321
00:37:56,540 --> 00:38:02,540
use that model to make a better
and cleaner internet. >> I like
that, that hadn't come up

322
00:38:02,542 --> 00:38:14,162
before. Switzerland has made
themselves undevourable. Great
chocolate but. I love this, your

323
00:38:14,167 --> 00:38:21,167
laughing at all my jokes.
They're absolutely between a
mystery of terrane, weaponry

324
00:38:21,167 --> 00:38:27,375
saying we are too difficult to
target. Individual companies
have been able to do that in the

325
00:38:27,375 --> 00:38:34,515
Internet. I'm saying we're too
tough. Look some where else.
That doesn't work quite so well.

326
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:40,120
I love that as a model. How can
we take that and read out and
see if we can make that work on

327
00:38:40,125 --> 00:38:49,540
the scale. >> It seems like a
combination of apathy and
ignorance. >> Yeah. >> There's a

328
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:55,540
saying that if predator is too
successful in the short term,
he's going to starve to death in

329
00:38:55,542 --> 00:39:02,333
the long term. I'm wondering
whether that concept has been
part of your research when

330
00:39:02,333 --> 00:39:08,708
you're evaluating what the
tipping point is going to be? Is
there going to be a tipping

331
00:39:08,708 --> 00:39:16,580
point or after a certain point,
is it just going to come into
equilibrium? >> That's what

332
00:39:16,580 --> 00:39:25,600
happens to predators, too
voracious, resource depletion.
We're the ecosystem. It destroys

333
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:29,300
it. That's what I'm worried
about at the end of the day.
They're not going to exhaust

334
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:36,160
each other. They will eat our
servers out of existence. I was
talking to one of the four‑star

335
00:39:36,167 --> 00:39:46,207
generals and they say, Jay, I
get it. If I'm fighting a naval
battle or an air battle, not

336
00:39:46,208 --> 00:39:52,500
given civilian ship to sail or
fly through my battle zone. I
get there there's a difference.

337
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:59,250
I say to them I'm sorry. That's
the wrong analogy. You are
sailing or flying through an

338
00:39:59,250 --> 00:40:05,208
Internet that we built, that
companies built using our own
money. They're not sailing or

339
00:40:05,208 --> 00:40:13,000
flying through your battle
field. You're sailing in our ‑‑
in the sea that we built. And

340
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:19,540
that's what's going to get that
resource depletion. I'm
interested to know about what

341
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:29,900
that looks like. Go to my right
here... >>Here at DEF CON you
have an army willing and able to

342
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:37,080
implement technical solutions to
this problem, but on the
societal and political fronts,

343
00:40:37,083 --> 00:40:46,875
what does the army look like? Is
it strong with their strategy?
>> There's not a strategy yet.

344
00:40:46,875 --> 00:40:49,833
That's part of what I'm trying
to bring together. That's part
of what the DarkTangent is

345
00:40:49,833 --> 00:40:55,542
trying to bring together. When
he's talks about why he spent
time in D.C., trying to social

346
00:40:55,542 --> 00:41:03,542
engineer Washington D.C. Kind of
learn their ways so he can
manipulate them. You have a lot

347
00:41:03,542 --> 00:41:10,375
of folks from the White House
and home land security and other
places, so it's starting to come

348
00:41:10,375 --> 00:41:16,792
together. But I think at this
time's still, it's still not an
army yet. And the more that we

349
00:41:16,792 --> 00:41:21,432
can hear the voices from the
community, like, for example, in
Germany you have the computer

350
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:27,140
club, I was told the other day
has a much stronger role. In
other countries, some of the

351
00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:31,940
companies have their own
governance and we're not going
to get that there. >> So is a

352
00:41:31,945 --> 00:41:40,080
technical solution enough? >> I
don't think we can invent our
way out of this, because the

353
00:41:40,083 --> 00:41:49,660
government, all governments ‑‑ I
got the one minute. The coercive
power of government right now is

354
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:56,458
winning. I'm not saying, by the
way governments are the only
threat. They are amongst the

355
00:41:56,458 --> 00:42:02,667
threat that we're facing. But
the coercive power of
governments is showing itself

356
00:42:02,667 --> 00:42:08,875
begin and again to be superior
here. It isn't just in the
field. If you look for example

357
00:42:08,875 --> 00:42:13,975
across the average spring, if
you look across all the
revolutions, it was people

358
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:20,420
spouting liberty and freedom and
force cannot bring us down and
nothing was ever won with a

359
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:26,958
bayonet, now they are finding in
Egypt and Libya and other
places, the bayonet does

360
00:42:26,958 --> 00:42:34,375
sometime have the last say. We
as a community can not sit back
and say well, our free speech is

361
00:42:34,375 --> 00:42:39,458
going to win out in the end,
because it's not. The government
has a lot of coercive powers.

362
00:42:39,458 --> 00:42:44,917
China and other governments have
way more. I don't think we are
gong to talk our way out. Thank

363
00:42:44,917 --> 00:42:50,917
you very much. (Applause)[End
