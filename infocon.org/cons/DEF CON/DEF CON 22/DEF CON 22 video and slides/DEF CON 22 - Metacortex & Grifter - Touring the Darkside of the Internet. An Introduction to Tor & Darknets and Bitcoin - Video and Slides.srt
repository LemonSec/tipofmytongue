1
00:00:00,042 --> 00:00:04,750
 >> First off, welcome to a tour through the
dark side of the Internet, I'm
Grifter, this is my good friend

2
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:15,170
Meta Cortex, we're from DC 801,
based out of Salt Lake City,
Utah. We don't often get that

3
00:00:15,333 --> 00:00:22,873
reaction, so thank you! So who
are we? We're these guys. >> Up
here on stage. >> Yeah, up here.

4
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:31,200
That's us. >> Yeah. Better. All
right. >> We're going to show
you something here that I think

5
00:00:31,208 --> 00:00:39,788
it's actually pretty funny. So
this is us, we're explorers, we
like to wander around in back

6
00:00:40,292 --> 00:00:44,917
alleyways and things like that.
What's kind of funny is that
we're both looking at the exact

7
00:00:44,917 --> 00:00:50,125
same thing as you can tell,
like, this is in a back alley of
I don't even know where in

8
00:00:50,125 --> 00:00:54,833
Tokyo, we were just wondering
around. >> Shinjuku. >> Is that
where we were? >> Yes. >> We

9
00:00:54,833 --> 00:00:59,917
were in Shinjuku. I wasn't
paying attention apparently. But
that's what we like to do, we

10
00:00:59,917 --> 00:01:05,792
actually spend a good portion of
that trip, and I think it's a
good metaphor for most hackers

11
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:12,292
where we would get on a train,
and then we'd say let's pick a
random number, all right, 6 and

12
00:01:12,292 --> 00:01:17,583
we'd get off 6 stops later and
just start walking. We have no
idea where we're going. I don't

13
00:01:17,583 --> 00:01:23,458
speak Japanese, neither does he,
we don't read it. We just went
because that's how cool shit

14
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:34,938
happens, so that's what we like
to do. So I'm Grifter, DEF CON
goon. Also, multiple DEF CON

15
00:01:35,417 --> 00:01:44,617
speakers, this is my 6th time on
stage at DEF CON. Founder of DC
801, way back in the day, I'm

16
00:01:45,792 --> 00:01:54,372
old. And the founder of -- or
the cofounder of the 801 Labs
Hacker Space in Salt Lake City.

17
00:01:55,042 --> 00:02:00,708
>> And I'm the same, a little
bit, minus the creds. This is my
first time speaking at DEF CON,

18
00:02:00,708 --> 00:02:10,988
so I'm really excited, a big
portion of DC 801. [Applause] >>
Helper on the hacker space in

19
00:02:11,292 --> 00:02:15,542
Salt Lake City. So if you're
ever running through there come
check us out and we will give

20
00:02:15,542 --> 00:02:24,502
you free booze. >> Like legit,
we really will! Okay, so just a
quick warning, I know this

21
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:31,458
should go without saying, but we
are going to talk about some
things that are questionable.

22
00:02:31,458 --> 00:02:36,042
Now, who defines what that
questionable is, you know, can
be argued, but we'll just say,

23
00:02:36,042 --> 00:02:41,292
you know, we can't promise you
won't be offended by what we
talk about. We may talk about

24
00:02:41,292 --> 00:02:50,472
drugs, murder-for-hire, hacking,
cracking groups, carding, all of
the above. And so if that makes

25
00:02:50,708 --> 00:03:01,288
you a sad panda, then somebody
else would probably fill your
seat. >> Who in here is a fan of

26
00:03:01,792 --> 00:03:09,752
-- what's that show's name?   What
is that show's name? (Audience:House of Cards!)   So this is a nice little clip from it,

27
00:03:10,125 --> 00:03:20,305
theoretically it should work. No
audio! Brutal. >> Now we're the
sad pandas. >> Let me turn that

28
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:38,300
up a little bit. See if that
works. >> Maybe. Maybe, oh! >>
Help us audio guy, you're our

29
00:03:38,667 --> 00:03:54,387
only hope. It's the USB to the
sound card. No, it's a bad
cable. >> Please pause while we

30
00:03:54,667 --> 00:04:11,047
fix the audio. Doo, doo, doo,
doo, doo, doo, come on guy, we
look like asshats. [Laughter] >>

31
00:04:11,375 --> 00:04:27,055
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo.
One more time. Nope. Well, that
sucks. 

32
00:04:28,083 --> 00:04:38,123
CLIP >> 96% of the Internet, <inaudible>  in search engines most of it is useless, but it's where
you go to find everything and

33
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:46,980
anything. Narcotics,
hackers-for-hire. >> How did you
access it? >> Pretty easy. >> I can show you if you want.

34
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:54,060
Yeah sure go ahead. >> Okay first thing you need is Tor. Some people prefer ITP But I think Tor is better.

35
00:04:55,583 --> 00:05:01,125
Yeah. So. >> Tor is very much
better. >> Tor is very much
better. What we love about that

36
00:05:01,125 --> 00:05:05,875
is they're at work, and dudes
like -- >> Just like shift over
brother and I'll just jump on

37
00:05:05,875 --> 00:05:12,292
like a darknet, like here at the
office. It's totally cool, we're
going to go check out

38
00:05:12,292 --> 00:05:21,252
hackers-for-hire and dark
markets and whatnot. >> So am I
on the desktop? My audio fails.

39
00:05:22,792 --> 00:05:27,292
>> It's really painful not being
able to see that screen. >> Not
see anything. >> What are we

40
00:05:27,292 --> 00:05:33,292
looking at? Desktop? There we
go. There we go. Now I'm on my
desktop. >> Okay. >> Better? >>

41
00:05:36,875 --> 00:05:42,958
Hey! All right. >> So we're
going to talk about Tor,
connecting to it, using it,

42
00:05:42,958 --> 00:05:50,583
onion sites, we'll get into
that. Bitcoin and how it works
and how to use it, mining

43
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:56,583
Bitcoin a little bit, we're not
going to get into that too much.
So take it away Meta. >> We just

44
00:06:01,875 --> 00:06:07,875
went through these. All right.
So finding what you're
interested in, going out there

45
00:06:10,417 --> 00:06:16,667
and finding, you know, different
forums, darknet forums that are
various things that you can look

46
00:06:16,667 --> 00:06:22,458
up. Not all of them are
nefarious, some of them are just
places where government censor

47
00:06:22,458 --> 00:06:28,125
their citizens, and so it gives
them an opportunity to have a
platform where they can discuss

48
00:06:28,125 --> 00:06:31,958
issues that are relevant to
things in their country or
problems that they're having in

49
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:37,583
their country without being
black bagged in the middle of
the night. We will also talk

50
00:06:37,583 --> 00:06:42,542
about things like hacker forums,
carder forums, things like that.
I'll even throw out a couple of

51
00:06:42,542 --> 00:06:48,375
ways you can find them, darknet
search engines, how to find what
it is that you want and

52
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:52,792
marketplaces where you can buy
physical things and actually
have them, like, dropped shipped

53
00:06:52,792 --> 00:06:58,583
to, hopefully not your house,
but somewhere where you can pick
it up and nobody knows who you

54
00:06:58,583 --> 00:07:05,208
are. That's pretty much it. And
we'll talk about some OPSEC
stuff, tips to help you make you

55
00:07:05,208 --> 00:07:11,167
a little more anonymous. >> All
right. Tor, I'm assuming most
everyone here at DEF CON has

56
00:07:11,167 --> 00:07:17,750
heard of it, undertone anyway,
it is the onion router, it is a
series of routers on the

57
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:23,750
Internet that anonymize your
traffic and notice the little
warning at the bottom, the NSA

58
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:33,167
will pick you out and put you on
a list for searching for it or
downloading it. >> And we've

59
00:07:33,167 --> 00:07:37,750
been on that list for a long
time so we're not really
sweating it. Although when we

60
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:42,458
saw the thing where you search
for this or downloaded this in
the last, like, it was like 3

61
00:07:42,458 --> 00:07:47,500
years and you're on a list. And
we're like whoa, we're going to
like to the top of the list now,

62
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:53,167
because we're telling everybody
about it at DEF CON. >> This is
a great diagram about how it

63
00:07:53,167 --> 00:08:00,208
actually works. The only thing I
do not like about it is the
little red an arrow going to Bob

64
00:08:00,208 --> 00:08:05,625
that says, oh, it's an encrypted
traffic, if you are sending
HTTPS through and it will be

65
00:08:05,625 --> 00:08:23,125
encrypted on that. So we like to
think of Tor a little bit like
this. [Music Playing] >> Now

66
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:35,140
it's working. [Laughter] >> You
know, we were just jumping
through all of those little

67
00:08:35,625 --> 00:08:40,000
things. All those little boxy
things. That's great. >> I do
scream like that every time I

68
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:46,500
connect it though. [Laughter] >>
I've got to tell you, it was
really annoying, like, while

69
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:52,750
we're making this presentation.
So how do you do this? There's a
couple different options. You

70
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:59,458
can use the Linux command line
or Mac command line, and you can
App get it or install binaries

71
00:08:59,458 --> 00:09:04,542
for it. And I'm mainly a Linux
guy, so you'll see those on the
slides. And XETOR, TORRC, are

72
00:09:04,542 --> 00:09:09,375
mainly where you do all the
configuration for it. What it
does is it starts a proxy

73
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:15,375
listener on your local host, you
can pinpoint anything to that
port and you're running through

74
00:09:20,625 --> 00:09:27,500
Tor after its connected. Pretty
basic, but even further to make
it even more basic, they create

75
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:33,458
the Tor browser bundle, it's a
simple download, you download
it, install it, run the EXE,

76
00:09:33,458 --> 00:09:39,833
it'll connect the Tor, launch a
Firefox browser and that whole
browser is running over Tor.

77
00:09:39,833 --> 00:09:45,708
It's pretty nice. It will come
with some additional plug-ins on
it as well that we'll cover. So

78
00:09:45,708 --> 00:09:50,500
more in depth, we'll run through
these really quick because of
demos, there's a whole bunch of

79
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:56,875
information on configuring it,
and let's see if we can connect
to it live. The demo Gods

80
00:09:56,875 --> 00:10:02,875
usually have been hating on me
today, so we'll try it. >> You
realize you have to scream like

81
00:10:06,208 --> 00:10:12,208
a lunatic now when you connect
that. Wooo! [Laughter] >> There
we are, that's it. This browser

82
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:23,125
is configured to use Tor. I
clicked on it and we are now
theoretically anonymous. OP

83
00:10:23,125 --> 00:10:37,985
delivers! Right? All right.
Sweet! I mean, you are going to
have to see that video. That's

84
00:10:38,458 --> 00:10:44,250
an old screen shot, I just
updated this today. That didn't
pop up just now after I updated,

85
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:49,750
but that shows you connecting to
the Tor network on older
versions now. We don't need to

86
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:57,292
play this video because it
worked. >> All right. Once you
connect, you will see with the

87
00:10:57,292 --> 00:11:01,542
Tor browser, you will see it'll
have a couple of plug-ins
already installed. The Tor

88
00:11:01,542 --> 00:11:08,667
options will be how you
configure and use Tor. No script
which is important, use it, and

89
00:11:08,667 --> 00:11:15,667
HTTPS anywhere. Which we'll try
to enforce encryption through
everything. It's very important

90
00:11:15,667 --> 00:11:21,667
to have even outside of Tor
bundle, the Tor browser bundle.
Another way to do it is Tails.

91
00:11:24,333 --> 00:11:31,667
Tails is a live bootable distro.
It's Debian-based and it will
try and enforce absolutely

92
00:11:31,667 --> 00:11:37,833
everything you do to run through
Tor. It will fight you to write
anything to the disk so you will

93
00:11:37,833 --> 00:11:43,833
not leave any traces and you
will stay totally anonymous.
It's great. It works really well

94
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:56,083
right out of the box and comes
with a whole bunch of software
pre-installed, opening PGP,

95
00:11:56,083 --> 00:12:03,583
pigeon OTR, key pass, some
important things, but true
crypts and unfortunately, we're

96
00:12:03,583 --> 00:12:09,583
going to have to --
unfortunately, we're going to
have to pour one out. And Tails

97
00:12:15,458 --> 00:12:21,458
will land you on another list as
well. That's what it looks like
once you actually boot it up in

98
00:12:23,875 --> 00:12:30,875
the normal mode. Standard Debian
desktop, nothing fun, but you
can also force it to go to XP

99
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:36,875
mode. [Laughter] >> So, you
know, you're sitting in a coffee
shop and you don't want anybody

100
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:43,542
to know you're doing some evil
hacks, no one is going to
question an XP desktop.

101
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:52,792
[Laughter] >> All right. We're
connected to Tor. Sweet! What
can we do with this? We can do a

102
00:12:52,792 --> 00:12:58,792
whole bunch of fun stuff. I like
tunneling other restricted
networks, that was fun, staying

103
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:07,208
anonymous, you know, that whole
bullet list that you guys see up
there. Where the fun really

104
00:13:07,208 --> 00:13:14,000
comes in, in my opinion, is the
Tor hidden services, this turns
Tor into a darknet, these are

105
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:19,417
sites that live exclusively in
the Tor network and you cannot
reach them outside of the Tor

106
00:13:19,417 --> 00:13:25,417
network, and you can't really
trace down who owns them unless
you have it offset. Most

107
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:36,958
websites there will use the dot
onion address to reach them. Oh,
hey, we have a pin in there, we

108
00:13:40,375 --> 00:13:46,375
said put a pin in it and we
didn't. >> Yeah. I mean, we put
a pin in it. I don't know what

109
00:13:48,458 --> 00:13:54,333
the fuck the pin is for.
[Laughter] >> There was a bullet
point we wanted to make, we will

110
00:13:54,333 --> 00:14:00,333
move on. [Laughter] >> Our bad!
>> Hidden services is -- you can
see exactly how it works with

111
00:14:05,458 --> 00:14:09,750
some of the Tor documentation,
it's kind of complex way out of
the scope of what we're going to

112
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:17,708
talk about today. So moving on,
finding hidden services. This is
currently some of the hardest

113
00:14:17,708 --> 00:14:23,958
things -- barriers to entry when
you're getting into Tor. The
notorious one is the hidden

114
00:14:23,958 --> 00:14:30,208
Wiki. Most people like to use
that. I have found at times it
is extremely out of date. Most

115
00:14:30,208 --> 00:14:37,417
of the links in there are broken
or dead. But you do find some
gems. Tor find is another one,

116
00:14:37,417 --> 00:14:42,875
Tor search. Grams, I actually
really like it. It is dedicated
to searching darknet

117
00:14:42,875 --> 00:14:48,167
marketplaces. So you actually
type something in, it will
search and index all of those

118
00:14:48,167 --> 00:14:54,125
marketplaces and show you what
you want across all the
different ones. Deep web links

119
00:14:54,125 --> 00:15:00,333
and Reddit, note, those are not
in Tor. You will be tracked
going to those because they are

120
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:07,542
not dot onion addresses, but
good nonetheless for links, and
word of mouth. A lot of people,

121
00:15:07,542 --> 00:15:15,208
you know, spread onion sites by
word of mouth. And links that
they send their friends. There

122
00:15:15,208 --> 00:15:20,458
are some fun sites that are in
Tor that I think are of interest
that I just wanted to put in

123
00:15:20,458 --> 00:15:27,125
here for no good reason, Pirate
Bay is on there. Also, keep in
mind, if you're downloading

124
00:15:27,125 --> 00:15:35,000
Torents that may be illegal, run
it through Tor. Just because you
download Torent through, Pirate

125
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:41,250
Bay does not mean you're staying
anonymous. My favorite, which
was actually down as of a little

126
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:47,542
bit ago, the assassination
market, it is a crowd-funded
assassination website. Now,

127
00:15:47,542 --> 00:15:55,375
regardless of whether it's
actually legitimate or not, I
doubt it is. You pay Bitcoin in,

128
00:15:55,375 --> 00:16:01,333
and you say I want somebody to
kill this person, and everybody
starts putting Bitcoins in

129
00:16:01,333 --> 00:16:06,917
around it and whoever proves,
however you do that, that you
assassinated this person gets

130
00:16:06,917 --> 00:16:12,917
all the Bitcoins. There were
some fun names on that list.
Unfortunately, we can't pull it

131
00:16:15,208 --> 00:16:22,708
up, but Rent-A-Hacker is another
good one. You will penetrate
anything you want for any amount

132
00:16:22,708 --> 00:16:28,708
of Bitcoin. We might pull that
one up later through the lulls.
Here are some good forums you

133
00:16:31,333 --> 00:16:37,833
can go to, TCF is pretty much
the biggest carding forum you'll
come across that I've seen. It

134
00:16:37,833 --> 00:16:43,833
does require a $50 entry to get
on to it. They did that because
of spammers getting on there, so

135
00:16:47,833 --> 00:16:55,167
once you get in, you can buy
credit card numbers, identities,
all of that, a lot of fun, super

136
00:16:55,167 --> 00:17:00,958
cheap, we'll pull that up later.
Intel exchange, a lot of people
link to that one, it's mainly

137
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:08,250
trolling on illuminati stuff,
and the deep web and how to get
to Miranda's web, which is fun.

138
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:14,250
Hack BB is kind of another
forum, they do things like run
this sketchy executable and you

139
00:17:18,625 --> 00:17:26,333
will get backdoored to anything
you want. Some marketplaces,
most people are interested in

140
00:17:26,333 --> 00:17:33,333
actually buying stuff like this.
You can check out the darknet
markets, we actually have a

141
00:17:33,333 --> 00:17:39,958
listing on the side of the page
with all the current markets,
their statuses, whether or not

142
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:46,042
somebody thinks they've been
compromised, the quality of
them. Super up to date. Most

143
00:17:46,042 --> 00:17:53,667
people use Agora though, version
2.0. Agora is a decent one and
my favorite, actually,

144
00:17:53,667 --> 00:17:59,958
Evolution, we have purchased
some stuff through Evolution
which we will show you later. So

145
00:17:59,958 --> 00:18:05,958
let's demo some of that. This
should work. So I'm going to
grab the silk road URL. Pop in

146
00:18:15,125 --> 00:18:21,125
the Tor browser. It could take a
second. Hey, it works! So I
created this. Nope. Haha,

147
00:18:39,625 --> 00:18:45,625
sucker! By the time you get on
to DEF CON stage and you can't
remember your password! Maybe

148
00:19:03,833 --> 00:19:09,833
not. I'm an idiot. Let's see if
we can create one real quick. If
I can remember my user name. I

149
00:19:16,125 --> 00:19:22,125
am a terrible speller. What is
that password? Password 1,
somebody just yelled it out.

150
00:19:34,417 --> 00:19:40,417
1111, in case anyone cares. Oh,
come on! [Laughter] >> This is
terrible. [Laughter] >> What he

151
00:20:06,625 --> 00:20:10,458
doesn't know is that I changed
his password, and this is
actually a psychological

152
00:20:10,458 --> 00:20:16,458
experiment about stress. I'll be
speaking about it later in the
sky talk! [Laughter] >> Oh,

153
00:20:21,667 --> 00:20:27,667
restricted words. You can't have
DEF CON in the name apparently.
[Laughter] >> I wouldn't be

154
00:20:39,333 --> 00:20:47,083
surprised if someone is trying
to register that right now, and
it kicked me out. Hooray!

155
00:20:47,083 --> 00:20:53,083
[Applause] >> So what was that?
>> He's saying is that how
someone new would get an

156
00:21:00,167 --> 00:21:06,167
account? >> Yes, you just sign
up from here. >> Yeah, that was
a good demo, actually, perfect.

157
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:20,042
Silk Road. As you can see on the
left, a lot of people like
buying their drugs through here,

158
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:27,292
but we have a whole bunch of
other fun stuff. We're more
interested in the electronics

159
00:21:27,292 --> 00:21:32,375
and the hacker stuff, so let's
go ahead and hit up electronics
and we'll just see what they

160
00:21:32,375 --> 00:21:39,250
have today, it's always
changing, we never know what
they have. Oh, Wi-Fi hacking,

161
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:45,250
sweet! SIM cards. Virtual Honey
puffs, that's probably a book.
Some Amazon gift certificates

162
00:21:54,208 --> 00:22:00,208
maybe, USB drives, a lot of
anonymous reference, hey, a
drone, that looks like fun.

163
00:22:12,375 --> 00:22:18,375
Hackers underground handbook. >>
Oh, that sounds legit! >> Order
me up one of those! >> So as you

164
00:22:22,833 --> 00:22:27,792
can see, there's various things
on here, some of it is
worthwhile than other things.

165
00:22:27,792 --> 00:22:34,583
You're going to have to sift
through things to find what you
actually want. On a lot of these

166
00:22:34,583 --> 00:22:39,208
sites we found that when you do
find something that you're
interested in, as long as the

167
00:22:39,208 --> 00:22:44,250
seller has been around for a
little while, you actually get
what they're selling, like so

168
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:50,208
it's kind of nice, like, if you
think you are going to be doing
some back alley deal and you're

169
00:22:50,208 --> 00:22:56,042
not going to get what you're
looking for and then it shows up
and you're surprised but your

170
00:22:56,042 --> 00:23:02,333
also pretty happy. [Laughter] >>
If you're not willing to lose
the Bitcoin, don't spend the

171
00:23:02,333 --> 00:23:08,042
Bitcoin, though, I would say
that. >> This one looks fun, the
neuroscience kit, anybody

172
00:23:08,042 --> 00:23:14,250
actually going to try that. >>
Yeah, sign me up for that shit.
[Laughter] >> Plug stuff into my

173
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:20,250
brain. All right. That's a good
run through that. Continuing on,
ha! You don't need a video, that

174
00:23:28,333 --> 00:23:34,333
worked. >> Almost. Almost needed
a video. >> Carding sites, those
are fun, you know, buy people's

175
00:23:36,667 --> 00:23:41,458
identities, credit card
information, numbers, date of
births, Social Security numbers

176
00:23:41,458 --> 00:23:47,458
at times. As I said earlier,
TCF, the biggest one requires
the $50, depending on, you know,

177
00:23:50,417 --> 00:23:56,083
the actual amount changes due to
bit coins inflation or
deflation. But it's always about

178
00:23:56,083 --> 00:24:04,042
50 bucks. CC, another fun one,
it kind of looks kind of sketchy
to kind of buy something off of

179
00:24:04,042 --> 00:24:10,625
there, so I don't know how legit
it is, but it's really good to
actually see the prices of some

180
00:24:10,625 --> 00:24:16,625
of this contact material. So
let's do that now. Yes. >> Who
knows how to take a picture

181
00:24:21,458 --> 00:24:25,750
because I want a picture of us
up here? >> We're so
egotistical. >> I'm going to

182
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:31,750
hand my camera to a stranger! >>
Oh, that one went down.
[Laughter] >> Because that one's

183
00:24:38,833 --> 00:24:44,833
down, we may have to do TCF
which I'm not happy about, and
I'm burning an identity doing

184
00:24:51,417 --> 00:24:57,417
so. No, I don't have to log in.
I think I do have to see prices.
Oh, well. I amousted. >>

185
00:25:04,875 --> 00:25:10,875
Terrible! >> Oh, that's just how
I look, nevermind. >> All right.
So let's check out some -- let's

186
00:25:15,625 --> 00:25:20,000
see if we can buy some stolen
identities on here. Virtual
carding, physical carding -- >>

187
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:25,875
We do not condone the theft of
identities nor the trading
thereof, but what is very

188
00:25:25,875 --> 00:25:31,500
interesting about this is that
we learned what your identity is
actually worth to someone else.

189
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:37,375
So try to keep that in mind when
he starts pulling up the cost to
purchase some of these things.

190
00:25:37,375 --> 00:25:44,417
You know, you hear about it in
the media all the time, identity
theft is rampant, and like how

191
00:25:44,417 --> 00:25:49,542
many millions of credit card
numbers are stolen from
different retailers every day,

192
00:25:49,542 --> 00:25:55,750
this is what they're brokering
for and it's pretty telling. >>
I've never actually seen it this

193
00:25:55,750 --> 00:26:01,750
low. $1 each. You're worth $1!
[Laughter] >> Let that sink in!
>> So here we go. Some of the

194
00:26:11,792 --> 00:26:16,792
stuff that they will actually
give you a credit card number
expiration day, CVV, name on the

195
00:26:16,792 --> 00:26:22,792
card, country, state, city,
address, and zip. $6. And if you
wanted European, that's 10.

196
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:38,250
Everybody hates us! Say again?
>> What are the chances that
you're just not being ripped

197
00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:43,625
off? >> The chances are actually
pretty good that it's going to
work because they actually are

198
00:26:43,625 --> 00:26:50,250
reviewed, these sellers, there
is a review system similar to
Amazon where people will say

199
00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:56,083
like I actually got this or I
had this and it worked for an X
amount of time, so like we

200
00:26:56,083 --> 00:27:01,417
highly recommend you guys going
out and doing this. >> Looking,
looking guys, holy crap! Like,

201
00:27:01,417 --> 00:27:07,417
damn it! >> I forgot where I was
for a second. Going out and
looking, again, it's really

202
00:27:13,125 --> 00:27:19,042
interesting from a research
perspective to go out and say,
like, what are we trading at

203
00:27:19,042 --> 00:27:26,000
today, that kind of thing.
You're like oh, the market is
low today. But it's interesting

204
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:31,792
to find out how these people
think, how they work, what
they're collecting, why they're

205
00:27:31,792 --> 00:27:35,375
collecting it, and when you
start talking to them about what
they're selling, you know,

206
00:27:35,375 --> 00:27:41,375
they're fairly open about it
because they know they're
anonymous, too. >> Sweet, moving

207
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:51,500
on. Again, no video. But here
are some fun things that I
really like to look at. We can

208
00:27:55,125 --> 00:28:02,750
buy some fake IDs, what about a
driver's license or even at the
bottom, fake passports, what if

209
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:08,750
you need to disappear to do some
sketchy shit. [Laughter] >>
Yeah. And not playing on Tor

210
00:28:11,375 --> 00:28:17,375
correctly. So these are fun.
What I have heard is actually
that our fake ID is legit and is

211
00:28:23,458 --> 00:28:28,000
super high quality from all of
the confirmed vendors in there,
so you don't have to go through

212
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Tor to get some of this. >> Go
through Tor, they'll give you
some of this! [Applause] >>

213
00:28:37,875 --> 00:28:43,875
We've got nothing! >> Thanks! >>
Oh. >> Focus, so while we're
pulling up fake ID sites, we're

214
00:29:08,333 --> 00:29:14,333
going to take some shots.
[Laughter] >> Here you go.
Sorry, I don't drink. Once

215
00:29:28,708 --> 00:29:36,333
again, Salt Lake City.
[Laughter] >> But everybody does
a shot! That means all of you,

216
00:29:36,333 --> 00:29:42,333
go ahead. >> Yeah. >> Right? >>
Right. >> Look for a new
speaker. >> Thank you!

217
00:29:47,458 --> 00:29:54,292
[Applause] >> That was really
good, it had like the nicest
blend of hydrogen and oxygen

218
00:29:54,292 --> 00:30:01,250
with it, it seemed like it
almost doubled hydrogen. >> Oh,
it's a 2014. >> That's a good

219
00:30:01,250 --> 00:30:03,250
year. >> Thank you, sir! >>
Don't call me sir! >> I'm sorry,
sir! [Laughter] >> So here's

220
00:30:03,250 --> 00:30:05,250
some fake passports you can buy
from all of these wonderful
countries. Let's look at the

221
00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:07,250
USA! USA! All right. We'll do
that. Actually we found that the
USA passports are the most

222
00:30:07,250 --> 00:30:09,250
expensive with all of our
looking around and things like
that, it seems like something

223
00:30:09,250 --> 00:30:11,250
about them makes them very
expensive. >> That's weird, I
wonder why that is? >> I will

224
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:13,250
not confirm nor deny any
activities. Because it's full of
freedom. So that's like the scan

225
00:30:13,250 --> 00:30:15,250
of one of those fake passports,
28 pages. >> Clear holographic,
laminate. It should look legit.

226
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:17,250
We've seen some people actually
take pictures of thiers and
they'll have all of the UV stuff

227
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:19,250
in it which is awesome.
Basically, you send them all the
information you want them to put

228
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:21,250
in there and a head shot and you
get a passport theoretically. >>
Yeah, we cannot confirm nor deny

229
00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:23,250
the quality of these documents
but they're amazing. [Laughter]
>> So there you go. Passports

230
00:30:23,250 --> 00:30:25,250
are a little pricey, $1,000 per
for a U.S. Passport. Let's see,
I like Japan, let's look at

231
00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:27,250
that. [Laughter] >> They like
Japan, too. >> Yeah! $700 for a
Japanese passport. Not too

232
00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:29,250
terrible, if you really need to
get away and actually use it.
Not bad at all. >> Could you

233
00:30:29,250 --> 00:30:31,250
list them all by price so you
can see what the cheapest one
is? >> There was somewhere that

234
00:30:31,250 --> 00:30:37,250
we could do that. Let me --
let's see if we can pull this
up. Yeah. They took that off.

235
00:31:17,958 --> 00:31:23,958
That's not coming up. I think
this is the one that I like.
Nope. No, that will work. So

236
00:31:29,458 --> 00:31:35,458
these are driver's licenses, so
$200 for a driver's license.
There we go, there's a picture

237
00:31:39,375 --> 00:31:45,375
of some of the UV stuff they can
do. Let's try the last one. Oh,
Lenovo power stuff, I hate you.

238
00:31:51,667 --> 00:31:57,667
That's what I get for using a
work laptop at DEF CON! Oh, now
it's on video, I don't know. No?

239
00:32:06,375 --> 00:32:12,375
Is that the one we already went
to? And the middle one? I don't
know. We're just pulling them

240
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:25,292
all up. This is the one I like a
lot! Free shipping! [Laughter]
>> What a bargain! >> No. >>

241
00:32:25,292 --> 00:32:31,292
I'll get to work on that. Let's
see what it says. I can't
remember how to get there.

242
00:33:08,708 --> 00:33:14,708
Pricing. There we go. >> There
you go. >> So U.S. 700 Euro and
then you can get driver's

243
00:33:48,667 --> 00:33:53,250
license, ID cards, you can
bundle them all together. The
thing I like about this vendor

244
00:33:53,250 --> 00:33:59,250
is for more money down at the
bottom, he will actually stamp
it with other countries stamps

245
00:33:59,250 --> 00:34:04,417
to make it look more legit. >>
It looks like you legitimately
traveled with that passport, you

246
00:34:04,417 --> 00:34:10,125
can rough it up a little bit and
make it look like it's been in
use. You can fly under the radar

247
00:34:10,125 --> 00:34:15,375
a little bit better, spend less
time, I can tell you from using
my legitimate passport that when

248
00:34:15,375 --> 00:34:22,958
I had one that was nearly full
versus having a brand-new one,
they spend a lot more time

249
00:34:22,958 --> 00:34:28,958
looking at the brand-new one. >>
Who was that? [Laughter] >> So
this is where we were going to

250
00:34:37,958 --> 00:34:42,833
demo gram, but most of those --
since we wrote these sites the
passport stuff has fallen off of

251
00:34:42,833 --> 00:34:48,833
Grams and it's mainly drugs. So
next slide. No video for you. So
what can you do with all

252
00:34:51,792 --> 00:34:57,792
passports? I like to think of
myself a little bit like this.
(Car engine rumbling) [Music

253
00:35:01,875 --> 00:35:07,875
Playing] >> Sorry. >> Just
enjoy! >> Yeah. >> Yeah, like
that! [Laughter] >> That's what

254
00:35:11,667 --> 00:35:17,667
I'd do. >> Sweet. So now we have
seen all of this awesome, fun
stuff that we can actually get,

255
00:35:25,667 --> 00:35:31,667
how do we do it, you say?
Bitcoin, obviously, most people
on the Internet try to use it.

256
00:35:38,250 --> 00:35:44,250
They do not accept DEF coin as
far as I'm aware of, that may
change. Basically, Bitcoin

257
00:36:13,625 --> 00:36:19,625
transfers money into a wallet
and when you buy anything, your
Bitcoin goes into an escrow

258
00:36:23,875 --> 00:36:27,875
account, and when you get your
item, the escrow releases the
Bitcoin into the seller. And

259
00:36:27,875 --> 00:36:35,333
then you have them ship it to a
location and we'll cover more
details of shipping and the all

260
00:36:35,333 --> 00:36:43,083
tech stuff. Yeah, more on
Bitcoin, mainly for reference,
so get these slides wherever

261
00:36:43,083 --> 00:36:49,083
they're distributed, we'll keep
going. More Bitcoin stuff, we're
continuing. All right. But

262
00:36:54,458 --> 00:37:00,000
Bitcoin tumbling, that's another
way to keep Bitcoin a little
more anonymous. Basically, you

263
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:05,250
throw money into a pot while
everybody else is throwing into
a pot and then they pay you back

264
00:37:05,250 --> 00:37:10,708
in certain small increments here
and there so it makes it really
hard to track, what goes in,

265
00:37:10,708 --> 00:37:16,417
what goes out, who it's going
to, who it's coming from, things
like that. If you're doing super

266
00:37:16,417 --> 00:37:22,625
questionable stuff, some people
argue against tumbling, it
doesn't hurt, you get most of

267
00:37:22,625 --> 00:37:28,625
your Bitcoin back minus a small
tumbling fee. So here, we'll
talk about some considerations

268
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:37,667
with Tor to help make it a
little more secure over some of
the stuff. Correlation attacks,

269
00:37:37,667 --> 00:37:45,125
those are probably the biggest
threat to Tor as far as I'm
aware of. Currently, if someone

270
00:37:45,125 --> 00:37:50,417
owns an entry node and exit
node, they can map that
connection back through and see

271
00:37:50,417 --> 00:37:56,000
who originally came in to and
where it's originally going to.
There was a small

272
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:02,750
semi-correlation attack that was
talked about in the Tor blog a
couple of days ago, where there

273
00:38:02,750 --> 00:38:08,708
were malicious relay nodes
injecting headers into the
packets to be able to track some

274
00:38:08,708 --> 00:38:15,292
of the darknet sites. They have
patched that and kicked those
nodes off the network, as of a

275
00:38:15,292 --> 00:38:22,417
week or two ago. Some browser
exploits can identify you. If
there is an issue in the

276
00:38:22,417 --> 00:38:28,500
JavaScript engine like there has
been before, JavaScript engine
in Firefox that will allow it to

277
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:35,708
ping back a server, not over the
Tor network. That'll identify
you real quick. Some

278
00:38:35,708 --> 00:38:41,708
considerations of Bitcoin to
make them a little more
anonymous, but keep in mind the

279
00:38:46,125 --> 00:38:53,625
entire block chain for Bitcoin
is public. You can track
absolutely every transaction

280
00:38:53,625 --> 00:38:59,625
that's ever happened over the
Bitcoin network. Tumblers help
against that but a lot of people

281
00:39:02,625 --> 00:39:09,083
transfer large amounts of money,
millions of small increments all
over the place so it just

282
00:39:09,083 --> 00:39:15,083
becomes impossible for any one
person to track all of it. Here
are some slides. Some OpSec

283
00:39:18,708 --> 00:39:24,708
stuff. >> There you go. >> Um,
let's see, so we're going to
talk about some things to just

284
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:41,792
be aware of, and behaviors that
you can do to try to make sure
that you remain anonymous. So

285
00:39:41,792 --> 00:39:48,833
stay updated on the Tor blog,
obviously, making sure that
finding out if there's any

286
00:39:48,833 --> 00:39:56,000
vulnerabilities, there was
recently a large vulnerability
in Tails, things like that, like

287
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:00,417
making sure you're looking to
see whether or not the tools
that you're using are kept up to

288
00:40:00,417 --> 00:40:06,125
date, what features are coming,
what features are leaving,
things like that. So, you know,

289
00:40:06,125 --> 00:40:13,208
as Matt has stated earlier,
keeping you're Tor browser
updated and stay updated on the

290
00:40:13,208 --> 00:40:19,708
status of markets, and use the
subreddit for that. Again, the
subreddit itself is not on Tor

291
00:40:19,708 --> 00:40:25,708
so you're on the clear net
there, so just be aware of
whatever activities you're

292
00:40:25,708 --> 00:40:32,458
doing, but browse around and see
what's going on there. Browser
segregation. Obviously, don't

293
00:40:32,458 --> 00:40:39,625
log on to Facebook in the same,
you know, browser that you're
using to get on and browse dark

294
00:40:39,625 --> 00:40:44,917
markets on Tor, that doesn't
make a lot of sense now, does
it? >> No. >> Using a VM

295
00:40:44,917 --> 00:40:50,208
specifically for your Tor
connections or Tails, this here
is my Tails laptop. I think one

296
00:40:50,208 --> 00:40:54,750
of you guys were talking about
Tails. I booted it up into Tails
real quickly into the Windows 8

297
00:40:54,750 --> 00:41:00,875
mode, so again, sitting in a
coffee shop you don't look like
you're doing something

298
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:08,208
nefarious. These -- this laptop
also does not have a hard drive
in it, it literally has the

299
00:41:08,208 --> 00:41:14,208
Tails disk and that's it. So you
can also boot to like a flash
drive. I actually have Tails in

300
00:41:17,542 --> 00:41:25,083
my pocket. I do have Tails in my
pocket and it's actually DC 101
flash drive from 2 years ago, so

301
00:41:25,083 --> 00:41:32,417
represent! And then, like you
were saying here, even better,
use something like this, like

302
00:41:32,417 --> 00:41:39,375
have something that's dedicated
specifically for, you know, what
you're doing on Tor or just

303
00:41:39,375 --> 00:41:46,958
using Tails, that kind of thing.
It's just another layer of
security, and it gives you I

304
00:41:46,958 --> 00:41:52,208
guess a warm fuzzy feeling
inside. >> Not only that but if
you're host OS is compromised,

305
00:41:52,208 --> 00:41:54,875
you can see everything your VMs
are doing. >> Indeed. So
actually, getting items, so you

306
00:41:54,875 --> 00:42:00,875
can see up here we do have a
couple of things, so we have
purchased some stuff, this was

307
00:42:04,750 --> 00:42:10,750
the safest things we thought we
could bring. So don't send it to
your house. Does that make a lot

308
00:42:13,917 --> 00:42:21,792
of sense there? We got that
clear? Do not send it to your
house, okay? So like you're on a

309
00:42:21,792 --> 00:42:26,917
dark market and you're like oh,
yeah, dude, yeah, sweet, drop
ship that bad boy, oh, by the

310
00:42:26,917 --> 00:42:32,000
way, here's my address. And it's
like, it doesn't make a lot of
sense to be anonymous if you're

311
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:38,000
giving away your address. But
send it to a P.O. Box or a UPS
store, so we would recommend

312
00:42:42,667 --> 00:42:50,125
also, do we recommend this? If
you wanted to do this, where's
my lawyer? If you wanted to do

313
00:42:50,125 --> 00:42:57,083
something like, let's say,
hypothetically, you were going
to get a P.O. box or a UPS box,

314
00:42:57,083 --> 00:43:03,250
order a fake ID and take that
fake ID, burn the box and go and
open up another box with said

315
00:43:03,250 --> 00:43:08,417
fake ID, now you have another
layer in between you and your
real identity, and space and

316
00:43:08,417 --> 00:43:12,083
that's a good thing. So you
might want to do that, if you
have access to an abandoned

317
00:43:12,083 --> 00:43:19,375
house or building or something
like that to drop things to.
Also swell -- >> Not right next

318
00:43:19,375 --> 00:43:23,167
to your house. >> Not right next
to your house, not the neighbors
or whatever, but if you happen

319
00:43:23,167 --> 00:43:26,500
to be lucky enough to live in a
neighborhood with a lot of crack
houses, fantastic! So never open

320
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:32,875
your questionable content
anywhere that you can be visible
to others. That should go

321
00:43:32,875 --> 00:43:38,875
without saying, but it's like,
oh, sweet, here's my, you know
-- you know, I'm not even going

322
00:43:42,625 --> 00:43:48,625
to say, I'll leave that to you
guys, get nasty. So wait until
you get home. Try waiting a week

323
00:43:51,917 --> 00:43:58,125
or two weeks to pick something
up, if you're anxious to get
something, then you're going to

324
00:43:58,125 --> 00:44:05,250
be more likely to get caught
doing whatever it is that you
decide to do. If somebody is

325
00:44:05,250 --> 00:44:08,667
waiting for you to receive
something, or there's an idea
that maybe you are going to get

326
00:44:08,667 --> 00:44:14,417
something that you shouldn't
have, you know, most agencies
are not going to sit around for

327
00:44:14,417 --> 00:44:21,500
a week or two weeks total for
you to pick something up. Also,
if you want, walk in, open up

328
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:25,833
the box, maybe, look at it, oh,
it's there, or don't even do
that. Just go up and say, did I

329
00:44:25,833 --> 00:44:31,583
get a package? Yes, you did.
Okay, great and leave. Come back
another time and pick up

330
00:44:31,583 --> 00:44:35,875
whatever it is that you need to
pick up sometime later, pick a
random day and go back then.

331
00:44:39,250 --> 00:44:45,250
Even more, don't reuse
identities. >> I like that one.
>> Yeah, don't reuse passwords,

332
00:44:48,292 --> 00:44:55,625
and disposable e-mails are
available here. >> We already
talked about this, but I already

333
00:44:55,625 --> 00:45:02,667
talked about this but opening
the mailbox and using the fake
ID. >> We bought some stuff.

334
00:45:02,667 --> 00:45:10,458
There's some stuff. This is our
baby monitor. So it runs over a
GSM network and you put a SIM

335
00:45:10,458 --> 00:45:16,458
card in it, you can call the
number that is associated with
the SIM card and it will listen

336
00:45:19,458 --> 00:45:26,417
to the room. So if you want to
listen to your baby in the
nursery, then you can call the

337
00:45:26,417 --> 00:45:30,042
number and now you have a baby
monitor that works at any range.
>> And it's small. >> Yeah. >>

338
00:45:30,042 --> 00:45:36,042
And it will auto dial you back.
When it reaches a certain level
of decibels it'll call you

339
00:45:38,458 --> 00:45:45,167
because it knows there's
activity. So that's the mini
baby monitor, that's what it

340
00:45:45,167 --> 00:45:51,542
looked like when we bought it.
That's reviewing the order
there. Yeah, that baby monitor

341
00:45:51,542 --> 00:45:57,542
looks great. And then here is
the confirmation e-mail that was
sent. So it's just saying, hey,

342
00:46:00,250 --> 00:46:05,917
this is when you're expected to
get it. It actually looks pretty
nice and professional to me. >>

343
00:46:05,917 --> 00:46:13,833
And UPS tracking. >> Yeah. UPS
tracking, it's on its way. All
right. We are just about out of

344
00:46:13,833 --> 00:46:18,792
time, so we're going to leave
you with some parting thoughts.
>> So clearly, everything we're

345
00:46:18,792 --> 00:46:22,875
talking about here is a little
bit -- we've had some fun with
it, we've had some laughs, a

346
00:46:22,875 --> 00:46:30,583
little tongue in cheek and some
of it falls into a gray area.
You decide whether it stays in

347
00:46:30,583 --> 00:46:36,625
the gray area or you take it
further than that. Also, where
you live or where you're located

348
00:46:36,625 --> 00:46:43,417
can change whether or not that
gray area is no longer a gray
area. So be aware of that, and

349
00:46:43,417 --> 00:46:49,417
stay anonymous. Like anything,
darknets can be used for good
and evil. The good side, again,

350
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:58,750
if you live under an oppressive
government then this is a
fantastic tool for you to be

351
00:46:58,750 --> 00:47:03,125
able to communicate with people
just like you who don't like
what's happening in your

352
00:47:03,125 --> 00:47:08,458
country, and you can try to get
together and maybe cause some
change. If you're interested in

353
00:47:08,458 --> 00:47:13,167
what is going on in the world
and you want to talk to people
who are in these situations,

354
00:47:13,167 --> 00:47:17,125
darknets are good for things
like that. Don't take the
media's word for it, get out

355
00:47:17,125 --> 00:47:23,167
there and read it straight from
people's mouths. >> Straight
from their keys. >> Straight

356
00:47:23,167 --> 00:47:29,167
from their keys. So we have
legit purposes. They're not just
for shady shit, but there's a

357
00:47:31,208 --> 00:47:37,208
lot of shady shit! [Laughter] >>
And in our view, Meta Cortex and
I believe this is the future of

358
00:47:40,542 --> 00:47:47,375
how we will communicate, it must
be the future of how we
communicate. We can't trust our

359
00:47:47,375 --> 00:47:52,458
own governments, we think we
live in the land of the free and
we don't any more. It's sad, but

360
00:47:52,458 --> 00:47:57,708
a reality. So start learning
this stuff and start being those
pioneers who help everybody

361
00:47:57,708 --> 00:48:02,750
else, figure out how to be
anonymous, encrypt their
traffic, and stay safe on the

362
00:48:02,750 --> 00:48:10,083
Internet! Thank you! [Applause]
>> If you're ever in Salt Lake
City, look us up, seriously. We

363
00:48:10,083 --> 00:48:16,083
love taking hackers to dinner!
Oh, there are some appendixes on
the slide as well.
