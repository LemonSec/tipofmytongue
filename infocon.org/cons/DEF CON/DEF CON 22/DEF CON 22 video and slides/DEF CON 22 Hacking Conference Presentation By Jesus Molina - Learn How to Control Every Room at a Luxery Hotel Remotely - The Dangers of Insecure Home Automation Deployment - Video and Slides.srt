1
00:00:00,167 --> 00:00:06,083
>>This is Jose Molina and he'll
talk about more problems with
home automation stuff. Let's

2
00:00:06,083 --> 00:00:12,083
give him a big party track
welcome? Applause (Applause)  >>
Perfect. Hi, everyone, it's nice

3
00:00:18,792 --> 00:00:22,542
to have so many people here,
great, this is going to be a fun
-- going to be a fun talk. So,

4
00:00:22,542 --> 00:00:29,167
it's good you are here, you can
drink, have fun, this is the
party track-- all right. I will

5
00:00:29,167 --> 00:00:32,708
just start with the questions
for you, and it is the
following: If I were here to

6
00:00:32,708 --> 00:00:39,250
tell you someone can control
every appliance in your room,
except the locks and maybe the

7
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:45,500
thermostat but everything else
like the TV, lights, the blinds,
everything else, would you stay

8
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:51,500
at that room or would you check
out tonight? Not the locks. They
cannot do you any physical harm

9
00:00:54,333 --> 00:01:00,500
and they cannot steal your shit
but everything else is
controlled by someone. Okay? So

10
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:06,542
think about it. I will come back
to this talk, to this question
later. So who am I? I am a

11
00:01:06,542 --> 00:01:10,958
security consultant based in San
Francisco. This part of the talk
is brought to you by my mom

12
00:01:10,958 --> 00:01:17,625
I want the second last name to
be said so my name is Dr. Jesus
Maria Molina Terriza. So, I'm a

13
00:01:17,625 --> 00:01:20,625
spanish guy. I'm from La Mancha
where we roll our
(indiscernable)and all that

14
00:01:20,625 --> 00:01:26,417
stuff. My website is -- My
Twitter handle is
@verifythentrust. And give me

15
00:01:26,417 --> 00:01:32,375
tequila and I will give you more
videos which are more fun. All
these video I sell have

16
00:01:32,375 --> 00:01:39,792
plausibility, meaning I can say
someone else did it with the
iPad. All right. What did I do?

17
00:01:39,792 --> 00:01:44,583
This is kind of the romantic
side of security where someone
goes to a place and they see

18
00:01:44,583 --> 00:01:50,583
something is broken and they
will try to hack into or
something, this is kind of this

19
00:01:53,917 --> 00:01:58,667
talk. I have 48 hours to do this
cause I was checking out, in the
process I was able to control

20
00:01:58,667 --> 00:02:02,542
200 + rooms at a five-star hotel
by using an insecure home
automation protocol. So I was

21
00:02:02,542 --> 00:02:06,583
able to raise the blinds, the
TVs, switch on everything, in
200 plus rooms. While I was a

22
00:02:06,583 --> 00:02:11,375
guest in the hotel, In China,
okay, so give me credit for
this, you know, because it was

23
00:02:11,375 --> 00:02:17,375
kind of scary!  (Laughter) I did
not hack anything. I abused
something. Okay, So that is

24
00:02:19,917 --> 00:02:26,000
different things! The good thing
is this is a story with a happy
ending. Right, because I talked

25
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,083
with Starwood and they were okay
with this talk. Actually, they
supported it, they say go ahead

26
00:02:31,083 --> 00:02:37,417
and do it. I talk with the CIO,
by the way that was the most
awkward talk in the world. My

27
00:02:37,417 --> 00:02:41,667
lawyer was on the phone with me,
his lawyer was on the phone with
him. We were like, Hi, how are

28
00:02:41,667 --> 00:02:45,667
you doing? We know you did
something in our hotel! Explain
what you did to us.  (Laughter)

29
00:02:45,667 --> 00:02:51,792
But the fact is that they
disabled the system right away
and they have changed the policy

30
00:02:51,792 --> 00:02:58,667
on all hotels which are the
seratones and the -- (Inaudible)
-- because of this. They did the

31
00:02:58,667 --> 00:03:06,458
correct steps, you know, they
did very good at that. Well,
let's go to the talk.  Um, the

32
00:03:06,458 --> 00:03:12,458
hotel is the St. Regis -- in
China is the city, hotel is
there in the 20 top stories of a

33
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:22,833
skyscraper beautiful place. This
is kind of like Die hard three
take over Die Hard one. You

34
00:03:22,833 --> 00:03:30,292
know, -- but the feature of the
hotel except that really caught
my attention was an iPad. This

35
00:03:30,292 --> 00:03:34,542
ipad was is able to control,
appears in every room and is
able to control every feature of

36
00:03:34,542 --> 00:03:39,125
the room. So, the ipad comes in
every room, With the iPad you
can raise the blinds, switch on

37
00:03:39,125 --> 00:03:45,333
the lights and put the music on,
switch on the channel for the
TV, all that stuff, right.  So,

38
00:03:45,333 --> 00:03:51,583
I was there in the room and I
was like, okay, so can I control
the room with my laptop run it

39
00:03:51,583 --> 00:03:55,708
along with my ipad. So, the
first thing I did was, I said,
whoa what is communicating

40
00:03:55,708 --> 00:04:01,417
between the ipad and the things
in the room? So, the ipad is
open to inspection and tampering

41
00:04:01,417 --> 00:04:06,875
so I arose the ipad and where
was the ipad connected to? The
ipad was connected to the guest

42
00:04:06,875 --> 00:04:13,167
network at the hotel. If you go
to the hotel and you know the
guess network is open. You can

43
00:04:13,167 --> 00:04:17,208
-- you have to be for the
Internet but you can be
neighborly with all the people

44
00:04:17,208 --> 00:04:22,458
connected to. So, the guest
network is open to
inspection and tampering. So, the

45
00:04:22,458 --> 00:04:27,792
automation protocol these guys
used from the iPad to every
feature in the room needs to be

46
00:04:27,792 --> 00:04:34,667
secure. Well, it was not! Hence
the talk here.  All right. I
checked what was connecting,

47
00:04:34,667 --> 00:04:40,667
what was sending the iPad to
every device and I found out it
was telegrams from single port.

48
00:04:43,417 --> 00:04:50,333
So I went ahead and checked in
the Internet what was this port
about. I decide that there was a

49
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:56,333
KNX, who in this room knows what
KNX is? No one. All right. So
KNX is a super extended protocol

50
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:07,625
for home automation in Europe
and China and Asian Europe
really really oh centered there.

51
00:05:07,625 --> 00:05:10,417
Because it's a standard. In
China, KNX is the only home
automation standard. If you want

52
00:05:10,417 --> 00:05:13,125
to make a deal in the airport
you have to deploy KNX. This is
kind of serious. In the 1990s

53
00:05:13,125 --> 00:05:19,333
and it is very simple to deploy,
you can see this is an activator
so basically it you plack all

54
00:05:19,333 --> 00:05:25,333
the devices to the activator,
and there is another wire, a
wire protocol another wire you

55
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:36,333
can send messages to and switch
on the lights, raise the blinds
and everything. Right? So it's

56
00:05:40,417 --> 00:05:45,375
an open standard and with open
it means closed and that's
another interesting fact here

57
00:05:45,375 --> 00:05:50,208
right? (Laughter) First time I
saw this I was like okay I will
go to the Internet and download

58
00:05:50,208 --> 00:05:54,583
the standards and see what
happens. But you have to pay a
thousand Euros to the lowest

59
00:05:54,583 --> 00:06:01,250
standard and that's an open
standard. So but the KNX people
decided to give the standard to

60
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:07,875
Universities so universities
created open source clients and
that's how I was able to

61
00:06:07,875 --> 00:06:12,375
understand the standard, by
taking all these clients,
looking at the code and then I

62
00:06:12,375 --> 00:06:17,333
could make out what was going on
there. And another fun fact is
that there is absolutely no

63
00:06:17,333 --> 00:06:24,333
security. Okay. So, this is
interesting. This is from the
1990s where there was physical

64
00:06:24,333 --> 00:06:29,292
securities around all these
wires so they didn't need to put
any security. However, they

65
00:06:29,292 --> 00:06:35,292
decided to create a evolution of
the protocal called KNXIP which
ended up being KNX messages with

66
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:45,000
IP frames but didn't put any
security either. And that is
known since 2006. So, 2006 there

67
00:06:47,167 --> 00:06:52,625
was a document saying hey there
is no security and these people
said there needs to be security

68
00:06:52,625 --> 00:06:58,625
but no idea anything except six
months ago the KNX people send a
new protocol evolution, new

69
00:07:01,292 --> 00:07:07,083
version of the protocal that has
does have -- that does have some
security on it that they say but

70
00:07:07,083 --> 00:07:13,583
I cannot download it so I really
know. Maybe in 5,000 years I can
check it out!  So how this works

71
00:07:13,583 --> 00:07:21,583
in the hotel. So every room has
a single IP. That is the IP that
I saw they were communicating

72
00:07:21,583 --> 00:07:27,583
through. That is a KNX IP
router. This KNX IP router what
it does, it converts these IP

73
00:07:30,208 --> 00:07:36,500
information into KNX
information. KNX it's a wired
protocol so all this goes

74
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:41,500
through wires and as you see the
wire protocol KNX has a
different way of forming

75
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:47,208
addresses. They are like three
numbers. The first number there,
you see like three numbers with

76
00:07:47,208 --> 00:07:52,583
the slashes. The first number is
the area line. The second number
is the area number. Second

77
00:07:52,583 --> 00:07:55,958
number is the line number and
the third number is the device
number. As you can see there a

78
00:07:55,958 --> 00:08:01,958
light will have 222 and a TV
will have 223. So, it's kind of
easy to guess, right? The rest

79
00:08:07,375 --> 00:08:12,042
of the hotel so the rest of the
hotel if I wept to connect to
another room you see the

80
00:08:12,042 --> 00:08:18,042
difference there? Like there was
another IP address that room is
777, next room is 7778. The IP

81
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:26,292
address is correct I think. So
then if you look at the device
numbers for each device, like

82
00:08:26,292 --> 00:08:32,292
222 in the room 7778, there was
like 232. Okay? So it was a
little more difficult than that.

83
00:08:34,625 --> 00:08:41,917
You know there are different
floors --but I went to different
rooms and I was able to tell but

84
00:08:41,917 --> 00:08:48,292
what next number for each room.
So, I was like I have them up
for each IP address and room,

85
00:08:48,292 --> 00:08:55,458
oh, nice, that's maybe for me?
Alright, So the protocol said
now that I know that every room

86
00:08:55,458 --> 00:09:00,500
has an IP address that every
device in every room has an
address, right? So, the only

87
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:05,792
thing I need to do now is code
the protocol. The protocol goes
like this, you know, I send a

88
00:09:05,792 --> 00:09:12,500
connect request to the IP
address, it says hey, yes, and
they give me like a window of

89
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:18,292
that I have to use after that.
I create a request and it sends
back connector response, saying,

90
00:09:18,292 --> 00:09:23,542
hey, that's good. You are
connected to the KNX network.
After this I send a permanent

91
00:09:23,542 --> 00:09:30,333
request and after this moment I
can send anything I want to the
KNX network. Meaning that I can

92
00:09:30,333 --> 00:09:34,875
send anything to switch on the
lights and switch off the
lights, open the blinds close

93
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:42,042
the blinds. This packet I sent
internally is called a kenney
and it's what goes into the KNX

94
00:09:42,042 --> 00:09:48,042
network. At the end I disconnect
request and that's it! If I have
the protocol to connect to the

95
00:09:51,292 --> 00:09:57,000
KNX network I have the IP
address for every room and I
have the address KNX address for

96
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:04,500
every device, what can I do with
it? I can raise every blind of
the hotel at will. So what I'm

97
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:10,500
sending to the wire to the
Kenney thing that I was talking
about. So you see, it's really

98
00:10:13,167 --> 00:10:18,833
simple. Like UDP and enveloping
a kenny frame. So, all these
numbers, they don't make any

99
00:10:18,833 --> 00:10:23,583
sense to you. They didn't make
any sense to me in the 40 hours
I was in the room but after

100
00:10:23,583 --> 00:10:28,125
researching I was able to
understand. This is like part of
the code of one of the open

101
00:10:28,125 --> 00:10:31,292
source plans I was told you.
This is not from the standard.
This is like something I said.

102
00:10:31,292 --> 00:10:35,625
And I saw there's a lot of
things there but the only
important things you have to see

103
00:10:35,625 --> 00:10:41,625
there is there's an address and
an action. The Address is the
address of the device I want to

104
00:10:41,625 --> 00:10:46,917
switch on. The action is
depending on the device and
that's specified in the only

105
00:10:46,917 --> 00:10:52,583
open document that KNX has,
which is how you use, what
action do you use for each

106
00:10:52,583 --> 00:10:58,500
device. For example, a light
bulb, to switch on and off is AP
and AP1. To raise the

107
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:02,833
thermostat, which is also
controlled by a room it is like
different stuff that you have to

108
00:11:02,833 --> 00:11:10,208
send but it's like you code it
and that's it. All right, so
the question is: Can I switch,

109
00:11:10,208 --> 00:11:15,042
and that was kind of the quest
here, can I switchd a TV on in
every room. If you have been

110
00:11:15,042 --> 00:11:19,667
following the talk and I hope
you have, you would understand
that if I can switch one light

111
00:11:19,667 --> 00:11:26,417
bulb I can switch every device
because I don't need the device,
the device numbers and I need

112
00:11:26,417 --> 00:11:32,417
the device numbers for my room
and if I can switch on the TV or
blinds in my room, if I know the

113
00:11:35,208 --> 00:11:42,500
IP address of every room, then I
can switch every TV on every
room. Okay. So if I said you can

114
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:50,292
switch one light bulb that means
I can switch every TV.  I want
to show you exactly that. Oh, by

115
00:11:50,292 --> 00:11:56,292
the way, I was super caffeinated
so sorry about that! So let me
-- look at the left right there.

116
00:12:02,042 --> 00:12:09,875
See what's going on there?
That's the first time I try to
do this!  (Laughter) That is

117
00:12:09,875 --> 00:12:15,875
happiness, of not being caught.
All right. So (Laughter) I was
doing that for posterity, so I

118
00:12:28,042 --> 00:12:33,750
wanted to record this. Alright,
so you see thelight bulb right
there, I used the smallest light

119
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:37,792
bulb because it was the absolute
brightest. (Indiscernable)
--raising the blind, turning on

120
00:12:37,792 --> 00:12:43,792
tv's but I think this was the
most, the fastest to show, see
the light goes on, the light

121
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:53,708
goes off and I am using my
laptop to do this. That was like
after a whole night of working

122
00:12:53,708 --> 00:13:00,542
on this and I had to code my own
protocal and stuff, you know.
Okay, let's go back. Alright.

123
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:11,200
So we are in like I need to
send in a ton of requests which
you can use EIBD, which is

124
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,292
a daemon, it's open source,
you can download it right
now and you can start sending

125
00:13:14,292 --> 00:13:21,167
KNX frames on the wire. Very
fast. The problem is that the
daemon you can not paralyze, it

126
00:13:21,167 --> 00:13:27,875
works, it connects with a single
IP address and I said I wanted
to have the power to raise every

127
00:13:27,875 --> 00:13:32,875
TV so I have to code my own in
Python. Really simple.
Very simple protocol. It's a

128
00:13:32,875 --> 00:13:38,792
free protocal. You need the KNX
address of each device in the
room. So, what I did is I

129
00:13:38,792 --> 00:13:44,250
pressed the iPad, plop, plop,
plop, automated connection and
it will give me every address

130
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:50,375
and action of every device in
the room. They have this library
of all these things. After this

131
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:57,250
I get the IP address of each
room and KNX area and line. That
is required a little more

132
00:13:57,250 --> 00:14:03,458
complexity so what I did is
change rooms all the time. I
will go, call downstairs, hey, I

133
00:14:03,458 --> 00:14:09,625
don't like this room, can you
put me in another room? They
will be, okay!  (Laughter) Two

134
00:14:09,625 --> 00:14:16,333
hours later, hey, I don't like
this room. Too much light coming
on! Can I change rooms? They

135
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:23,375
were like, okay. (Laughter) I
was, like, I cannot sleep in
this room. So, they end they

136
00:14:23,375 --> 00:14:30,542
give me this room which is the
suite. (Laughter) And It's a
beautiful duplex suite like

137
00:14:30,542 --> 00:14:35,792
beautiful floor-to-ceiling
windows but there is a problem
with this room because of what

138
00:14:35,792 --> 00:14:41,792
I've done there is no iPad.
(Laughter) I will continue.  >>
Are there any new speakers here?

139
00:14:45,458 --> 00:14:51,458
Raise your hand.  >> Yeah.  >>
Hey! We got one! (Applause)  >>
So, What do you think of foam

140
00:14:56,208 --> 00:15:03,333
hinge -- (Inaudible) -- right
there? That foam hinge right
there? Like right there. Foam

141
00:15:03,333 --> 00:15:09,333
Hinge. We ordered a full-sized
foam Stonehenge for you.  >>
Yeah, I know, I know you told

142
00:15:11,833 --> 00:15:17,833
me. You told me, that's great. I
love it.  >> All right.  >>
Cheers!  >> Cheers!  >> Cheers  

143
00:15:20,917 --> 00:15:28,375
(Applause)  >> Come on!
(Applause)  >> That was good.
Thank you very much. Do you have

144
00:15:28,375 --> 00:15:32,750
another one?  >> Good luck
continuing.  >> Alright, that
was not tequila by the way. That

145
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:40,500
was some sort of pretty strong
stuff. Anyways... so the problem
with the suite was there was no

146
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:46,083
iPad. So, I could not continue
my research there. So, I had to
call back and say, hey, I really

147
00:15:46,083 --> 00:15:53,500
don't like this room. You know.
I don't like duplex's, it's not
my thing. You have to go

148
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:59,667
upstairs to sleep. They changed
my room again but the hotel
manager came and I was like hey

149
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:05,667
what's your problem? And then I
got -- again, I was in a hotel
in China, not afraid of a media

150
00:16:08,458 --> 00:16:14,000
scene but something, anyway,
they are asking this question,
hey Jose you told us you can

151
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:19,208
control every room but how do
you make sure you can control
every room? So we created this

152
00:16:19,208 --> 00:16:26,917
HeartBleed program where outside
each room there was the do not
disturb light. You see this like

153
00:16:26,917 --> 00:16:32,917
blue and red so the light sits
outside the room so I can go
outside and see Room 777 and I

154
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:41,708
can see its heartbeating, 778.
and I will see a heartbeating
and if I had time I would show

155
00:16:41,708 --> 00:16:47,500
you a video. But ugh, anyway. We
can tell whenever I press that
button I knew I had hacked that

156
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:53,875
room. I could switch on the TV
in that room I can do anything
in that room. So I did that for

157
00:16:53,875 --> 00:16:57,833
a couple of rooms.  Alright.
Were there other devices
connected? Maybe, but the

158
00:16:57,833 --> 00:17:03,292
problem is I tried sending
random requests to random
addresses that were not used and

159
00:17:03,292 --> 00:17:07,667
at some point someone knocked at
my door and I got super scared
and I was like oh my God they

160
00:17:07,667 --> 00:17:13,667
caught me, I'm ready to go to
Chinese jail. Take me with you!
I do my best. But it was the

161
00:17:13,667 --> 00:17:20,083
laundry lady, she was like
laundry, laundry. Then she went
to the other room -- I guess I

162
00:17:20,083 --> 00:17:23,833
did something there. But this
has not been confirmed by the
hotel. So, I am not really sure.

163
00:17:23,833 --> 00:17:28,667
I think I probably did
something. So, what does it
mean? By the way, not the

164
00:17:28,667 --> 00:17:36,667
rainbow guys for the stoner
people here next to me. Anyway,
for hotels, maybe it is to

165
00:17:36,667 --> 00:17:41,458
update their security policies.
They don't include things like
home automation or smart tv's

166
00:17:41,458 --> 00:17:46,833
and things like this that we can
take over because hotels in time
on these devices. Is this a

167
00:17:46,833 --> 00:17:51,917
problem in hotels? The answer is
yes. Are these particular
hotels, they do not tell which

168
00:17:51,917 --> 00:17:58,250
ones until I talk with them directly-- For
the Internet of Things we are --
anybody that deploys their own

169
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:04,250
protocols, nobody knows if they
are deploying and we give extra
care when they deploy automation

170
00:18:07,292 --> 00:18:11,875
in certain spaces because they
still think you have a cocoon
around them or something. What's

171
00:18:11,875 --> 00:18:17,750
the worst that can happen? When
they first asked me this
question, I was like I only had

172
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:23,083
one ipad and now it controls
every room of the hotel and the
guy in the room does not know. I

173
00:18:23,083 --> 00:18:29,208
switch on the TV and every TV in
the hotel switches on or I could
go with magnetic helmet and say

174
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:36,958
oh, he once died that and like
put my arms up and every blind
will switch on like all the TVs

175
00:18:36,958 --> 00:18:42,958
will start to flicker that seems
to be the worst thing that could
happen. I could go create chaos

176
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:50,750
-- but they dont think that's
the worst thing that could
happen now. I think what the

177
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:56,625
worst thing that could happen
and the question they asking me
for is because of this. I ask

178
00:18:56,625 --> 00:19:01,375
you: If I can control your room,
will you stay in that room
tonight? I don't know what your

179
00:19:01,375 --> 00:19:06,125
answer will have been. Probably
the answer is like yeah, what's
the worst that can happen you

180
00:19:06,125 --> 00:19:11,333
turn on my TV. What they will
say is it was Obama, can I
control your TV? If I go with an

181
00:19:11,333 --> 00:19:16,750
important news to you, do you
want me to control your TV? You
just said to me it's okay for

182
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:22,750
you to stay at your hotel even
if your not going to switch on
your TV. Well just so you know

183
00:19:25,708 --> 00:19:31,833
saying to a President saying I
will only switch your TV on if
it's important news I need to

184
00:19:31,833 --> 00:19:39,792
tell you. Your going to say yes
because it's the same thing. You
are just like give me power over

185
00:19:39,792 --> 00:19:45,750
your TV implicitly you are going
to say no to someone that has a
reason to do this? Not like me

186
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:50,375
switching on for sports. People
don't care and that's the worst
thing that can happen. I talked

187
00:19:50,375 --> 00:19:54,833
to so many reporters, so many
people about it and they always
ask me the same damn question. I

188
00:19:54,833 --> 00:19:59,458
don't care. You Switch on my
light bulb, I don't care you
switch on my TV, that's okay.

189
00:19:59,458 --> 00:20:04,750
You are not making any harm to
me, your are not stealing any
information from me. So go

190
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:07,125
ahead. This is not a big
security problem. Well, I
disagree. I disagree. It's not a

191
00:20:07,125 --> 00:20:13,125
big security problem because I
cannot do harm to you but at the
end is your peace of mind which

192
00:20:26,042 --> 00:20:31,292
I'm playing with so be careful.
 Thank you very much and have
fun. (Applause)
