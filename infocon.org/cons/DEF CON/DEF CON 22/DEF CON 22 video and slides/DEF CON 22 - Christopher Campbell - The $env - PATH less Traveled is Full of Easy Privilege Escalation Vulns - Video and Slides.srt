1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,600
All right. Say hello to KRBTGT.
Say hello to KRBTGT. Come on
this is DEFCON people! >> [Cheering] >>

2
00:00:11,208 --> 00:00:19,708
Since the beginning since your domain
was formed. KRBTGT has been
there. It's been there through

3
00:00:19,708 --> 00:00:23,908
the early years in 2000, 2004
>> [laughter] >>

4
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:31,375
when everyone thought
they were special and
deserved admin

5
00:00:31,375 --> 00:00:37,958
rights. You remember the time?
KRBTGT was there protesting with
everyone else that everyone

6
00:00:37,958 --> 00:00:43,875
should be an admin and then
there was these things called
domains an active directory and

7
00:00:43,875 --> 00:00:51,895
everyone wanted to be a domain
admin. Windows 2000 was
revolutionary but so was D con.

8
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:59,958
So in 2003, all those domains
that were sitting on the
internet very likely could have

9
00:00:59,958 --> 00:01:05,958
been owned by D com or
any of the worms that were
going around at that time.

10
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:16,040
Things got better, right? Everyone
remembers KRBTGT was there when
you finally installed a fire wall.

11
00:01:16,042 --> 00:01:22,458
So all those remote attacks and
those worms that were destroying
your domain for years finally

12
00:01:22,458 --> 00:01:28,583
stopped. It was the answer to
all of our security problems,
right? Yes. Then there was

13
00:01:28,583 --> 00:01:36,917
Windows XP probably Microsoft's
greatest product. Except there
was MSO8067 and once again pen

14
00:01:36,917 --> 00:01:43,292
testers and hackers rejoiced
because they were easily able to
knock over every enterprise.

15
00:01:43,292 --> 00:01:47,833
Then there was the great
administrative layoff of 2007 as
much when you realized your

16
00:01:47,833 --> 00:01:53,667
domain admin's group ballooned
to over 400 people and over a
hundred of them no longer worked

17
00:01:53,667 --> 00:01:59,667
at your company anymore. Why
would you say you have admin
rights? So then it really got

18
00:02:02,958 --> 00:02:10,958
better. 2009 the security
industry blossomed and everyone
was selling windows server 2008

19
00:02:10,958 --> 00:02:15,917
and KERBEROS was the answer to
your pass the hash problems. You
didn't have to worry about pass

20
00:02:15,917 --> 00:02:23,333
to hash anymore. KERBEROS it's
awesome. To manage your local
admin accounts you decide to

21
00:02:23,333 --> 00:02:29,333
deploy this policy group policy
preferences, right? Yeah.
Everybody did that. Including

22
00:02:31,708 --> 00:02:37,708
Microsoft. So in case you didn't
know group policy preferences
are terrible, you should never

23
00:02:45,625 --> 00:02:51,208
use them. Microsoft even came
out with a patch to keep you
from being able to use a feature

24
00:02:51,208 --> 00:02:55,708
that they swear was never
security vulnerability. If
you're using group policy

25
00:02:55,708 --> 00:03:01,167
preferences that's terrible.
That means anyone on your
network can get local admin

26
00:03:01,167 --> 00:03:09,042
rights or any of the passwords
that are in those group policy
preference files. So, let's talk

27
00:03:09,042 --> 00:03:15,375
about the last two years. So,
you decided to move on, the
domain moves on, the server 2012

28
00:03:15,375 --> 00:03:21,375
and KRBTGT is loving life
because you finally gotten rid
of MTLM you've gone to Kerberos.

29
00:03:27,167 --> 00:03:34,500
You got rid of MTLM and then
there was heart bleed. And it
knocked over all your VPN

30
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:40,500
servers and you got owned again.
And there was this thing the
golden ticket which no one seems

31
00:03:42,583 --> 00:03:50,167
to know anything about that you
find all over your network as
well. Account number two. Thanks

32
00:03:50,167 --> 00:03:56,167
to Mr. Benjamin Delpe in the
front row. So, do you know how
old your KRBTGT hash is?

33
00:04:02,833 --> 00:04:08,833
Anybody. When you created a
domain or when you upgraded from
2003 functional to 2008, anybody

34
00:04:16,042 --> 00:04:22,042
created their current domain in
2001? Nobody? 2002? 2003? 2004?
Five? Six? Seven? So anything

35
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:36,500
that happens to this domain was
2004 so I guess the question is
do you know where your KRBTGT

36
00:04:40,875 --> 00:04:46,875
hash is because this domain's
hashes are on P span.
(Laughter). 

37
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:57,333
>>> That's not good. But the
bottom line, the whole point of
this talk is this. If you've

38
00:05:01,125 --> 00:05:07,333
ever been owned, if your domain
has ever been compromised your
hashes dumped you may still be

39
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:14,667
compromised because that KRBTGT
hash is what's used to sign all
of the tickets so with that and

40
00:05:14,667 --> 00:05:20,667
only that tickets can be created
to take any user and add them to
any group or a lot more. Did

41
00:05:23,708 --> 00:05:29,333
anybody go up to the Kerberos
black hat talk besides the two
speakers in the front row who

42
00:05:29,333 --> 00:05:36,333
gave the talk? Awesome. They're
only here to heckle me and they
have been heckling me the last

43
00:05:36,333 --> 00:05:43,625
half hour while I had to sit
next to them the previous talk
but now I'm on stage and you're

44
00:05:43,625 --> 00:05:49,625
not. So maybe you could be like
this guy. Does anyone know who
this guy is? Nobody? Cool. So he

45
00:05:53,667 --> 00:05:59,667
testified before senate that as
long as you scan you're secure.
He testified against Dave

46
00:06:01,708 --> 00:06:09,000
Kennedy or countered Dave
Kennedy earlier this year and he
said that with a straight face.

47
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:14,958
As long as you're scanning
you're secure. You have not been
compromised. So ‑‑ (Laughter).

48
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:20,958
>> Now that I have an audience
other than twitter, I would like
to say good luck with that.

49
00:06:25,333 --> 00:06:31,333
Let's talk about Kerberos. Does
nobody get the name? No one gets
meme. I swear. All right. I'm

50
00:06:40,167 --> 00:06:47,875
not going to bore you with how
Kerberos works. That was Skip
and Ben's talk at BlackHat, but

51
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:54,625
this is the basics of it in a
really crude diagram I drew
several years ago. If you would

52
00:06:54,625 --> 00:07:01,042
like to go over that. But what I
want to focus on is the Spoofed
PAC attack which is the

53
00:07:01,042 --> 00:07:07,458
privileged account certificate
(PAC) which is a portion of the
Kerberos ticket. The previous

54
00:07:07,458 --> 00:07:14,375
diagram and this diagram are
taken from skip and my white
paper for black hat 2012 and if

55
00:07:14,375 --> 00:07:21,458
you see what we're doing here,
we're basically just adding
groups to the pack and then

56
00:07:21,458 --> 00:07:28,625
we're using the KRBTGT hash to
sign it and make it valid so you
can take any user and add them

57
00:07:28,625 --> 00:07:34,542
to any group temporarily and
they're not actually going to
show up on the domain network in

58
00:07:34,542 --> 00:07:40,542
that group so there's almost no
log of this unless you actually
use the privileges Who has heard

59
00:07:42,583 --> 00:07:48,583
of the golden ticket attack?
Awesome. So, golden ticket which
is a great branding by one

60
00:07:52,417 --> 00:07:58,708
Benjamin Delpe sitting in the
front row heckling me right now.
He added to the wonderful tool

61
00:07:58,708 --> 00:08:10,625
Mimikatz Who has used Mimikatz
before? Awesome. So, the golden
ticket attack is not just the

62
00:08:10,625 --> 00:08:16,792
spoof pack that skip and I
theorized several years ago. It
goes beyond that. It's not only

63
00:08:16,792 --> 00:08:22,667
that but in addition Ben was
like man, you guys are idiots,
you could make this ticket last

64
00:08:22,667 --> 00:08:29,583
forever. We were like wow, why
didn't we think of that? True
story. So there's a great

65
00:08:29,583 --> 00:08:34,292
tutorial by Rafael Mudge who is
awesome and not talking this
year, which I'm disappointed

66
00:08:34,292 --> 00:08:39,500
about but did he a great
tutorial, that's the link to it
if you want to check that out.

67
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:52,875
So now it's demo time. So, I
prerecorded because this is DEF
CON and I knew everything was

68
00:08:52,875 --> 00:09:03,495
going to go wrong. I'm just
going to pause it, cause it's
going to go real fast I'm doing

69
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:12,240
who am I. I'm limited user, I'm
nobody. In this scenario the
attackers already compromised in

70
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:16,958
one of those hundred ways that
we kind of talked about earlier,
compromise the enterprise way

71
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:28,680
back when in 2004 with D con or
MSO8O67 or MSO90S in server
2008. So, the question a lot of

72
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:34,375
people ask is if you knocked
over the domain then you've
already got everything. The

73
00:09:34,375 --> 00:09:39,417
point to all of this is that you
can leave and come back whenever
you want. You're not going to

74
00:09:39,417 --> 00:09:44,625
leave anything beaconing, you're
not going to leave anything to
find. So, this is one way of

75
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:53,265
coming back in this limited user
is going to check the group
membership or domain admin and

76
00:09:56,380 --> 00:10:05,792
it's just administrator like it
should be. No one else. All
right. Phishing E‑mail really

77
00:10:05,792 --> 00:10:13,542
important. Got to open that up.
From the boss. It's too legit so
we got to ‑‑ that was not enough

78
00:10:13,542 --> 00:10:19,542
hammer time. Hold on.
You got to get that.

79
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:26,833
All we need to do is enable
macros. So we've got 

80
00:10:26,833 --> 00:10:32,042
to do that. I'm going to put
this on youtube and that's
mostly for when I put this on

81
00:10:32,042 --> 00:10:39,160
youtube but what this macro is
doing is it's using PowerShell
and then PowerShell is going to

82
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:45,160
pull down invoke-Mimikatz. Has
anyone used invoke-Mimikatz and
power-- It was released last

83
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:53,180
year at DEF CON. A couple
people. It's awesome. Basically
we get a fully staged Mimikatz

84
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:58,300
without having to worry about
A/V or touching disk at all. So
what we're doing is we're using

85
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:05,860
a macro to call PowerShell to
pull Mimikatz down reflectively
in memory and then in addition I

86
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:12,292
added a few things so now I'm
going to use the Krbtgt hash
I've already stolen to create a

87
00:11:12,292 --> 00:11:18,417
ticket and add myself to the
domain admin group. It's not
just a Kerberos ticket for

88
00:11:18,417 --> 00:11:23,750
domain admins we'll take this
limited user and add them to
domain admins without them

89
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:29,208
realizing what's going on.
It's kind of a silly example not
really what you would want to

90
00:11:29,208 --> 00:11:37,625
do. How you would want to do
that. All right so now the user
has enabled macros and they

91
00:11:37,625 --> 00:11:41,565
shouldn't feel remorseful
but in this case shouldn't
have done that.

92
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:58,360
We see PowerShell firing up. And then
you'll see limited user is in
the domain admin's group.

93
00:12:05,417 --> 00:12:10,083
So thanks to Kerberos if you've
ever been compromised, it's
trivial to come back in. A

94
00:12:10,083 --> 00:12:16,083
single phishing E‑mail and all
privilege escalation is done.

95
00:12:39,208 --> 00:12:49,108
Let's talk mitigation. As I gave this
talk to a couple people, experts
beforehand ‑‑ what's that? >>

96
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:57,400
>> [Applause] >> Yay!

97
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:05,917
Both I and Windows 8
suck. All right let's talk
about mitigation. So, this side

98
00:13:05,917 --> 00:13:10,708
had to be reworked multiple
times because everything I had
on it was wrong originally. So,

99
00:13:10,708 --> 00:13:18,542
the easiest thing and if you
read this a couple places on the
internet, MSDN maybe one place,

100
00:13:18,542 --> 00:13:23,500
if you really want to reset the
password hash to the Krbtgt
account you got to do it twice

101
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:31,740
but be warned it might literally
break everything. Shear point,
exchange, you name it, it will

102
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:37,250
not automatically fix itself. It
may be multiple reboots. Someone
who has actually gone through

103
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:45,458
it, caution that it is not worth
doing and even Microsoft hasn't
done it. So, the only reliable

104
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:53,292
way is if you happen to have ‑‑
if your domain functional level
is 2003 and you've raised it to

105
00:13:53,292 --> 00:13:59,042
2008, this really shouldn't be a
reason to do it because if
you're doing this because you

106
00:13:59,042 --> 00:14:04,292
know you've been compromised,
you probably should start
completely over so I guess the

107
00:14:04,292 --> 00:14:08,667
biggest take away from this is
if you've gone through and
changed all of your passwords

108
00:14:08,667 --> 00:14:14,208
and thought that you were good,
you're not. Or if you're an
incident handler and you cannot

109
00:14:14,208 --> 00:14:19,042
figure out why a threat group
keeps coming right back in and
you can't figure out how the

110
00:14:19,042 --> 00:14:27,375
privilege is escalating this
very well could be the way. So,
it's all in Mimikatz. I put

111
00:14:27,375 --> 00:14:36,235
business practice DC with all
available futures don't get
owned again. Detection is worse

112
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:42,583
than mitigation. It is
completely a needle in the
haystack. Harder to detect than

113
00:14:42,583 --> 00:14:47,917
pass the hash. >> Pass the hash
you're actually doing something.
In this case you're generating a

114
00:14:47,917 --> 00:14:56,037
ticket on a single box. Until
you actually use it it would be
very difficult to detect. As

115
00:14:56,042 --> 00:15:01,750
well as whether or not your
Krbtgt hash has been stolen.
Unless you know you have been

116
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:08,375
compromised like you find PW
dump sitting on your PC I don't
know a way for you to know that

117
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:12,542
that has already been taken. You
can look for strange account
activity. I thought it was

118
00:15:12,542 --> 00:15:18,583
really sneaky, and I was like Im
going to look for ten year old
tickets and Benjamin is going to

119
00:15:18,583 --> 00:15:24,083
go ahead and change that is
feature to allow the tickets to
be an arbitrary length. Even

120
00:15:24,083 --> 00:15:30,375
that detection mechanism is not
going to work for Mimikatz. One
thing you could do is look for

121
00:15:30,375 --> 00:15:36,833
low privileged accounts
performing privileged actions.
That might be the only way to

122
00:15:36,833 --> 00:15:46,693
detect this particular attack. I
do want to give some thanks to
Skip. Stand up, Skip and

123
00:15:46,708 --> 00:15:56,167
Benjamin, can you come up here.
Is Joe here? Joe. He wrote
Invoke-Mimikatz which is the

124
00:15:56,167 --> 00:16:06,333
awesome PowerShell script and
added. Will and a bunch of other
people. This is Vince. Vince has

125
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:12,917
never been to America. He came
all the way here for DEF CON and
black hat. He seldomly ventures

126
00:16:12,917 --> 00:16:21,537
out of France and it took a lot
of negotiating I think and I
just really want him to feel

127
00:16:21,542 --> 00:16:28,000
appreciated for his tool
Mimikatz and the number of
people that use it so let's give

128
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,500
them a hand. (Applause). 

129
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:36,500
>>> And I think for his long
trip, he deserves this speaker
badge more than I do. So I'm

130
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:43,840
going go ahead and give him
that. (Applause). 

131
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:52,000
>>> One more time for Ben and
everybody else on the golden
ticket stub. Other than that,

132
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:58,000
that's all I got. I will see you
guys around and partying
tonight. (Applause).
