1
00:00:00,167 --> 00:00:07,208
 So the title of my talk is From
Raxacoricofallapatorius with
Love: Case studies in insider

2
00:00:07,208 --> 00:00:13,208
threat. For those who cannot
read circular galifrian I am
Tess Schrodinger. Agenda first.

3
00:00:17,333 --> 00:00:23,333
Going to go over just kind of an
introduction of myself and then
my slides. Little bit of history

4
00:00:31,042 --> 00:00:36,375
some, some definitions. I'd like
to get to current research if
possible if I have time. I got

5
00:00:36,375 --> 00:00:43,333
to cut this down and make it
short so I can't be very funny.
For those who don't know I won

6
00:00:43,333 --> 00:00:49,333
the contest this year. So thanks
for voting for me if you voted.
(Applause) So who am I? I've got

7
00:00:56,250 --> 00:01:02,958
about 20 years of law
enforcement investigation,
industrial security experience.

8
00:01:02,958 --> 00:01:08,458
Forensics. I say bullets and
bloods not ones and zeroes
because back when I did

9
00:01:08,458 --> 00:01:15,708
forensics if we encountered a
computer which was rare, we'd
have to call in the state. There

10
00:01:15,708 --> 00:01:19,875
was, like, a dude in the closet
somewhere who knows what to do
with this because it was a long

11
00:01:19,875 --> 00:01:25,875
time ago. I have a BA in
sociology. A master's in
security management. And I just

12
00:01:28,292 --> 00:01:34,750
completed my grad Cert in cyber
security technology. I've only
been doing the cyber part for a

13
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:41,750
couple years. My two mentors
will attest to the fact four
years ago the most complicated

14
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:48,583
thing I could do was put my out
of office on. Now I'm proud to
say I can write snort rules. So

15
00:01:48,583 --> 00:01:54,583
I've come a long way. When I say
not technical for you guys, one
of the things I noticed over the

16
00:02:01,583 --> 00:02:07,542
last couple years hearing people
talk is the whole insider threat
phenomena. They act kind of like

17
00:02:07,542 --> 00:02:14,958
it is this new thing. Oh no
suddenly we have to worry about
this. And if you know your

18
00:02:14,958 --> 00:02:20,500
history that's really not the
case. Insider threats have been
an issue since before the

19
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:26,958
beginning of time if you are
counting at zero. Those that are
familiar with Judas Iscariot,

20
00:02:26,958 --> 00:02:33,542
back with Jesus, he is famous
for selling him out for 30
pieces of silver on to the

21
00:02:33,542 --> 00:02:41,500
Romans. And, of course, you have
Guy Fawkes. Those who have seen
V for vendetta are probably

22
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:46,542
familiar with the masks. But not
a lot of people at least the
ones I run into that are into

23
00:02:46,542 --> 00:02:54,125
the trendy thing with the masks
realized it's taken from guy fox
which was the 1605 gun powder

24
00:02:54,125 --> 00:03:00,208
plot to assassin King James the
first of England. They had
packed the horse of Lords with

25
00:03:00,208 --> 00:03:05,208
gun powder in the basement and
they were going to blow it to
high hell and he was kind of

26
00:03:05,208 --> 00:03:09,750
caught guarding everything. So
he is the guy who went down with
it. That's actually where that

27
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:15,750
mask comes from. He stands for
the whole antiestablishment type
thing. 4 ADBC quite a long time

28
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:26,250
ago the battle of Thermopoly.
Anyone familiar with that? You
had the guy that pretty much

29
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:36,958
sold his country out. The Greeks
had set up position at this
particular place because of how

30
00:03:36,958 --> 00:03:41,125
the cliffs were form. It kind of
got them down into a narrow
line. They were going to be a

31
00:03:41,125 --> 00:03:47,333
little easier to tackle as they
were coming through single file.
And he decided that, you know,

32
00:03:47,333 --> 00:03:53,042
he would make a little cash off
this. He told the Persian Army
how to get around through the

33
00:03:53,042 --> 00:03:59,708
mountains to the south so they
could actually come up behind
the GreeksÕ position. We all

34
00:03:59,708 --> 00:04:07,417
know how that ended. 	His name
is actually synonymous in Greece
with traitor still today. It's

35
00:04:07,417 --> 00:04:12,625
been a very long time and they
still use that word for traitor.
Just was as in the U.S. if you

36
00:04:12,625 --> 00:04:17,792
were to call someone a Benedict
Arnold that is synonymous with
traitor. We have an

37
00:04:17,792 --> 00:04:24,458
international crowd so those not
familiar Benedict Arnold was an
American revolutionary war

38
00:04:24,458 --> 00:04:30,458
general. And very long story
short he got kind of bitter and
frustrated with the politics and

39
00:04:35,042 --> 00:04:39,792
the things that were going on
the American side during the
revolutionary war. So he decided

40
00:04:39,792 --> 00:04:45,792
to defect to the British side.
And he was actually in command
of west point at that time. And

41
00:04:47,833 --> 00:04:51,833
the plan was he was going to
just hand West Point over to the
British when they came to get

42
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:59,125
it. Major John Andre who was a
British soldier was caught on
the train. He had the plans to

43
00:04:59,125 --> 00:05:04,750
surrender west point on them. So
general Washington figured this
out before it actually happened.

44
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:10,333
Sent some guys after Arnold. He
managed to escape. He stayed in
this country, fought on the

45
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:15,750
British side and led raids in
Virginia and Connecticut before
the end of the war. I believe he

46
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:21,750
ended up going back to England
after that. He is one of our big
traitors in history here. Does

47
00:05:24,125 --> 00:05:30,125
anyone know who Robert Ford is?
Not the Canadian current
politician? Yes, I like Robert

48
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:39,042
Ford because sometimes I'll hear
people going I ain't got to
worry about insider threat I am

49
00:05:39,042 --> 00:05:45,042
the threat. That's what Jesse
James thought. Robert Ford and
his buddy were arrested by the

50
00:05:47,083 --> 00:05:53,083
by the sheriff in 1882. They had
actually shot and killed the
cousin of Jesse James. And the

51
00:05:55,833 --> 00:06:01,958
sheriff had caught them and
Jesse James wanted to get rid of
him was having trouble getting

52
00:06:01,958 --> 00:06:07,250
to him. Basically made a deal
with Robert Ford and said you
take James out and we'll make

53
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:13,250
this go away. Robert Ford of
course says sure I can make that
happen. So Robert Ford's brother

54
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:22,125
Charlie actually worked with
James and was on his gang and
team and did jobs with him. So

55
00:06:22,125 --> 00:06:26,625
he told Charlie what was going
on. You got to help me out, Bro.
Charlie goes back to Jesse and

56
00:06:26,625 --> 00:06:30,750
says hey my little brother wants
to come hang with us and, you
know, do some work. James was,

57
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:35,458
like, sure, yeah, okay.
Unfortunately it did not end
well after breakfast in a

58
00:06:35,458 --> 00:06:41,625
boarding house one morning when
they went upstairs to pack to
hit the next job, Robert Ford

59
00:06:41,625 --> 00:06:47,625
put a hole in Jesse James. Game
over. Took him out. Insider
threat right? Finally, I can't

60
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:57,417
imagine nobody knows the story
of Julius Caesar and how he was
betrayed by his friend Brutus.

61
00:06:57,417 --> 00:07:05,208
Those who are not familiar with
the story. Caesar was a Roman
general and politician who

62
00:07:05,208 --> 00:07:12,333
actually had risen up through
the ranks pretty high. Kind of
gotten the point he was dictator

63
00:07:12,333 --> 00:07:17,458
for life. This didn't sit really
well with a lot of the senators.
Because if you have a dictator

64
00:07:17,458 --> 00:07:23,958
for life you really don't need a
senate. So they kind of were a
little worried about their jobs.

65
00:07:23,958 --> 00:07:27,958
And in theory they were worried
about democracy. I'm pretty sure
they were more worried about

66
00:07:27,958 --> 00:07:34,958
their jobs. And they kind of got
a conspiracy together to take
Caesar out. And they tried to

67
00:07:34,958 --> 00:07:40,083
convince Brutus to join them but
Brutus was his friend and
trusted confidant, a member of

68
00:07:40,083 --> 00:07:46,125
his inner circle. He had been
made governor by Caesar. By all
accounts he was very, very tight

69
00:07:46,125 --> 00:07:52,167
and close to Caesar. But Caesar
was being a pretty big douche so
the conspirators convinced him

70
00:07:52,167 --> 00:07:59,042
to join them and they staged an
event, invited Caesar. They
surrounded him. The stabbing

71
00:07:59,042 --> 00:08:06,000
began. Historical accounts say
that Caesar did try to fight
back and crawl away, but once he

72
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:12,375
saw his friend Brutus was one of
the people that had turned
against him he just gave up.

73
00:08:12,375 --> 00:08:19,000
Interesting trivia I learned
apparently the whole Ôet tu
BruteÕ if you were forced to sit

74
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:24,958
through Shakespeare in school,
that is a Shakespearean
invention. There's no actual

75
00:08:24,958 --> 00:08:31,208
evidence he ever said that. Win
your next trivia game with that
one. Or hacker jeopardy. A

76
00:08:31,208 --> 00:08:37,208
couple of current cases, more
modern. This was four pillars
consulting versus Avery

77
00:08:41,208 --> 00:08:46,750
Dennison. Has anyone heard of
this? If you do security
awareness at your organization

78
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:52,583
this is a really fabulous
example. I love to use this one.
I've used it for years. A lot of

79
00:08:52,583 --> 00:08:57,500
times people don't understand
that there's a value to what
they work with. To them it's,

80
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:03,542
like, well it's not a rocket.
It's not, like, this top secret
thing. Who cares you know. They

81
00:09:03,542 --> 00:09:09,542
don't understand the value. I
love this example because
Dennison makes labels. They make

82
00:09:11,792 --> 00:09:17,417
adhesive stuff that goes on duct
tape. Really? If I work there I
would probably go who the heck

83
00:09:17,417 --> 00:09:23,417
wants this. Apparently someone
wanted it bad enough they paid
off their lead $160,000 to get

84
00:09:25,458 --> 00:09:32,042
it. He over I think about a
period of eight years, siphoned
this R & D and all these

85
00:09:32,042 --> 00:09:39,417
formulas and everything out to
them and he was caught and
charged. But I think this is a

86
00:09:39,417 --> 00:09:45,375
really good example. Because,
you know, people are willing to
pay that much money for that

87
00:09:45,375 --> 00:09:50,833
type of thing, imagine what you
work with, and how much someone
might be willing to pay for

88
00:09:50,833 --> 00:09:54,625
that. And this is again a great
example to use with your staff
when you are trying to show

89
00:09:54,625 --> 00:09:59,917
value to them or at least maybe
make them think differently
about how valuable what they're

90
00:09:59,917 --> 00:10:04,542
working on is. Then we have Mr.
Quentin Tarantino. Is anyone
familiar with what happened

91
00:10:04,542 --> 00:10:10,542
earlier this year with him? Yes.
He had a script that he wanted
to do. And he showed it to six

92
00:10:13,167 --> 00:10:20,417
people. Six. And he said don't
show this to anyone. So of
course it's on the internet,

93
00:10:20,417 --> 00:10:26,417
like, two days later. He was
absolutely furious. And just
ballistic about the whole thing.

94
00:10:31,583 --> 00:10:36,500
He's got attorneys. He's
demanding to know which one of
these six people leaked it. I

95
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:43,458
believe he shelved the script.
I'm never making this movie and
you betrayed me and he is still

96
00:10:43,458 --> 00:10:49,458
trying to figure out which of
the people he trusted betrayed
him. Again, this isn't a high

97
00:10:49,458 --> 00:10:55,750
tech or DOD thing. This is a
frigging movie script. But,
again, he was betrayed by

98
00:10:55,750 --> 00:11:02,792
someone he trusted. So couple of
quick definitions. Industrial
espionage versus economic

99
00:11:02,792 --> 00:11:08,667
espionage. I like to give the
difference because when you get
further into the study it's

100
00:11:08,667 --> 00:11:13,542
interesting to see how charges
are done and things like that.
Industrial espionage is

101
00:11:13,542 --> 00:11:19,542
essentially when two competitors
go at each other or, like,
corporate adversary type things.

102
00:11:24,833 --> 00:11:29,833
Economic espionage is when you
get into foreign government or
nations which could be through

103
00:11:29,833 --> 00:11:34,458
the guise of companies and
that's where the law gets all
squirrely and people who make

104
00:11:34,458 --> 00:11:41,500
way more money than I do deal
with that kind of stuff. When I
was doing my research I noticed

105
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:47,500
that a lot of words were used
kind of interchangeably. And I
was asking around like are there

106
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:53,500
hard definitions for any of
these? Pardon me it's really
dry. These are my definitions.

107
00:11:56,667 --> 00:12:00,583
Do not, like, if using them on
an exam and the teacher fails
you I take no responsibility.

108
00:12:00,583 --> 00:12:06,292
These are my definitions. A spy
is someone who doesn't
necessarily require a

109
00:12:06,292 --> 00:12:13,792
preexisting relationship with
you. They can have one, but it's
not necessarily required. A

110
00:12:13,792 --> 00:12:18,792
traitor, on the other hand, has
to have that preexisting
relationship so they can betray

111
00:12:18,792 --> 00:12:24,000
it. What's interesting about
insider threat which years ago
when I started researching this

112
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I did not realize is that an
insider threat doesn't have to
have a malicious agenda. So

113
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:37,000
where your spy has an agenda to
steal from you or your traitor
has an agenda to betray you, an

114
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:45,625
insider can be malicious,
meaning they've that agenda, or
they can just be, you know,

115
00:12:45,625 --> 00:12:52,625
someone who doesn't really care.
They're apathetic. Perhaps your
security awareness program sucks

116
00:12:52,625 --> 00:12:59,042
and they just don't know. They
don't necessarily have to
maliciously have it out for your

117
00:12:59,042 --> 00:13:06,875
firm. They could just be, you
know, a Jack wagon and that's
your fault. No I'm just kidding.

118
00:13:06,875 --> 00:13:12,875
So here's my obligatory sexy
slide for DEF CON. I was told we
had to have one in all of our

119
00:13:16,125 --> 00:13:20,708
decks. Honey pots I know we use
them a lot with networks. Honey
nets are things like that. But

120
00:13:20,708 --> 00:13:26,708
it's also an espionage term.
Sharon, this is for the ladies.
I say that because over the

121
00:13:31,583 --> 00:13:38,667
years when I've been briefed
countless times what I found
really interesting is that at

122
00:13:38,667 --> 00:13:44,208
some point whether it's a man
giving the brief or a woman
giving the brief, inevitably

123
00:13:44,208 --> 00:13:51,875
there is a point where they say,
okay, guys, if you are not sexy
at home in the bar down the

124
00:13:51,875 --> 00:13:57,875
street, you are not sexy 300
miles away from home. Okay. So
after a couple of years of this

125
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:05,833
I finally asked one of the guys
I worked with. I said, you know,
I'm not sure if I should be

126
00:14:05,833 --> 00:14:11,917
incredibly flattered that you
think that women, you know, we
have our shit so much together

127
00:14:11,917 --> 00:14:19,375
or we would never fall for boys
and their devil penis magic, you
know, or should I be insulted

128
00:14:19,375 --> 00:14:24,250
that you don't think we have
anything of value to come after?
Or, like, maybe we're just not

129
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:31,875
worth bothering to tell? I kind
of feel like that was the case
with Sharon Scranage. A little

130
00:14:31,875 --> 00:14:39,750
background. This occur Ghana in
the 80s. The only thing you need
to remember from the slide is

131
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:47,625
the name of the man in the coup.
Ghana broke free decided to
become their own country. They

132
00:14:47,625 --> 00:14:50,708
were fighting about who got to
be in charge. You know how that
always happens. This dude

133
00:14:50,708 --> 00:14:55,792
Rawlings stepped up and said I
am in charge, no more
constitution, no political

134
00:14:55,792 --> 00:15:00,000
parties. That's the way it's
going to be. His name is
important. Remember that as we

135
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:07,833
go forward. So Sharon was a CIA
employee. About seven years. She
was an operation support

136
00:15:07,833 --> 00:15:14,000
assisting ant so I think that's
a fancy way to say secretary. By
all accounts she was a good

137
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:21,292
girl. She wasn't a bad person.
You know, she was honor student,
high school cheerleader. She

138
00:15:21,292 --> 00:15:28,458
went to church religiously. She
sang in the choir. A good girl
they say. So what happened to

139
00:15:28,458 --> 00:15:35,083
her? Well a gentleman named
Michael happened to her. And he
happens to be this is where the

140
00:15:35,083 --> 00:15:41,083
other name comes in the nephew
of the man who ran the coup. So
he was assigned to seduce Sharon

141
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:50,417
when she was stationed in Ghana
as operations assistant to the
station and get as much

142
00:15:50,417 --> 00:15:55,083
information as he could out of
her. Now the goal was to take
that information, he passed it

143
00:15:55,083 --> 00:16:02,875
to the chief of intelligence for
Ghana, and he in turn passed it
along to the KGB, Soviet, Libya,

144
00:16:02,875 --> 00:16:08,875
East Germany, pretty much anyone
who wanted it. Why did he do
this? Well at the time Ghana was

145
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:17,125
pursuing a capitalistic policy.
They were really trying to cozy
up to Castro in Cuba and Daniel

146
00:16:17,125 --> 00:16:22,083
Ortega in Nicaragua. So having
this information helped them get
in with some of the people they

147
00:16:22,083 --> 00:16:28,083
wanted to get in with. So how
was she caught? She was caught
when an inspection team came to

148
00:16:35,125 --> 00:16:41,750
the station and she invited some
folks over for dinner at her
house. Apparently one of them

149
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:47,375
saw a photograph of him taped to
her nightstand. I guess you had
to pass her bedroom to get to

150
00:16:47,375 --> 00:16:53,042
the bathroom. Apparently in the
photograph he was not wearing
any clothes and he had his sheet

151
00:16:53,042 --> 00:16:59,042
draped strategically. He was,
like, look Sharon you need to
stop. She says okay I'll stop.

152
00:17:03,708 --> 00:17:09,250
Which she didn't. So the
inspection guy went back to the
chief of stations and told him

153
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:14,125
what was going on. They were
very concerned. They drew up a
report and sent it into SAD the

154
00:17:14,125 --> 00:17:20,125
special activities division with
CIA. They were basically the
division that looked into agents

155
00:17:25,042 --> 00:17:31,458
relationships with foreign
nationals if they had them. So
SAD looked into this and said,

156
00:17:31,458 --> 00:17:36,792
we're not really worried. A lot
of our folks in foreign
countries date foreign nationals

157
00:17:36,792 --> 00:17:42,792
regularly. And by most accounts
no one felt there was a real big
concern at the time. They denied

158
00:17:46,208 --> 00:17:52,958
the request to bring her home
and said she is almost done
there, we will- she is on her

159
00:17:52,958 --> 00:17:58,500
way back. She is going to get
reposted. We'll just do her poly
when she is back on leave. I

160
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:04,500
don't know how many of you are
familiar with poly technique but
they hit a question she

161
00:18:09,458 --> 00:18:14,292
struggled with. That was have
you given classified information
to anyone who wasn't authorized.

162
00:18:14,292 --> 00:18:20,667
That question really got her.
After about four days of
interview and interrogation she

163
00:18:20,667 --> 00:18:25,083
pretty much just confessed it
all and admitted she had been
giving all this classified

164
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:30,958
information. I believe it
included names of folks the
United States thought were

165
00:18:30,958 --> 00:18:36,583
potentially KGB double agents,
plans for a coup against the
current Ghana government by

166
00:18:36,583 --> 00:18:43,333
dissidents, com data, stuff on
military equipment that Libya
and other countries wanted from

167
00:18:43,333 --> 00:18:48,042
us. And she was sending out a
lot of the names of people
helping the CIA. She confessed

168
00:18:48,042 --> 00:18:54,042
to all this. She ended up
pleading guilty to three of 18
charges. Mostly because she, you

169
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:05,000
know, she felt bad but she also
agreed to help catch him. So she
had got him to meet in their

170
00:19:08,458 --> 00:19:15,417
hotel. They think the reason
because they had planned to use
her as a source once she got to

171
00:19:15,417 --> 00:19:21,417
Calcutta. But they arrested him
instead. He pleaded no contest
to espionage. They sentenced him

172
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:33,000
to 20 years in prison but then
decide to let him go in exchange
for all the Ghanans that had

173
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:37,750
been implicated which she
released all that information to
them. They had been rounded up

174
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:42,625
and arrested. They believe one
person was actually killed
because of his involvement. So I

175
00:19:42,625 --> 00:19:48,625
think a '94 "U.S. News and World
Report" said it cost $13 million
to bring all the affected back

176
00:19:56,958 --> 00:20:00,542
over to the U.S. and resettle
them and get them new lives. And
they exchanged him for that.

177
00:20:00,542 --> 00:20:04,083
Included among them were, like,
a guy with a posted telegraph
who had given the CIA the keys

178
00:20:04,083 --> 00:20:11,375
to manhole covers so they could
get down in there. And the chief
of police had been placing

179
00:20:11,375 --> 00:20:17,375
wiretaps. So those were some of
the guys they brought back over
here. So, why? Well supposedly

180
00:20:22,958 --> 00:20:28,458
she was married before she did
her CIA career and went over to
Ghana. By all accounts her

181
00:20:28,458 --> 00:20:33,708
husband had been pretty abusive
and not very kind to her. She
had just gotten out of a pretty

182
00:20:33,708 --> 00:20:41,208
bad marriage. Now you have to
picture yourself, you are a
black woman in the 1980s in a

183
00:20:41,208 --> 00:20:46,958
predominantly white male CIA
station. I'm pretty sure they
weren't inviting her to play

184
00:20:46,958 --> 00:20:51,750
tennis afterwards. So you've got
this woman who has left a
terrible relationship. She is

185
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:57,375
very vulnerable. Now she is in a
foreign country thousands of
miles from home and family and

186
00:20:57,375 --> 00:21:04,750
support system, probably not
with the most supportive working
environment that could be given.

187
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:11,917
And along comes this man who
just is, like, hey baby how are
you doing. And, you know, it's

188
00:21:11,917 --> 00:21:17,458
really easy to see how in her
vulnerable position she
absolutely could have fallen for

189
00:21:17,458 --> 00:21:23,083
all of that. Now she claims that
in the beginning, you know, he
basically just asked for the

190
00:21:23,083 --> 00:21:27,042
information. But then she was
kind of hesitant so he
threatened to break up with her.

191
00:21:27,042 --> 00:21:33,917
So she went ahead and got it.
But once he had that spigot open
she stopped being nice and was

192
00:21:33,917 --> 00:21:39,333
pretty much threatening her with
a gun. Threatening to kill her
office workers or herself.

193
00:21:39,333 --> 00:21:46,667
Threatened violence. I think
that is probably one of the
reasons she agreed to help get

194
00:21:46,667 --> 00:21:50,958
him arrested. But I like to
share that story because, you
know, we talk about the guys all

195
00:21:50,958 --> 00:21:55,708
the time and the hot girls. But
I think if you are a security
person and you have anyone at

196
00:21:55,708 --> 00:22:00,208
your environment in a vulnerable
position that could leave them
open to compromise or being

197
00:22:00,208 --> 00:22:06,542
manipulated or being used like
this, you need to be aware of
that. And you should think of

198
00:22:06,542 --> 00:22:11,083
how you are going to handle that
and how you can mitigate that
problem as an organization. To

199
00:22:11,083 --> 00:22:17,250
not only support a staff member
but, you know, to prevent damage
to your organization at the same

200
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:23,875
time. A little summary there.
The big red flag on this was the
fact that she promised to cut

201
00:22:23,875 --> 00:22:30,208
the relationship off and
refused. Intelligence identities
act was a big player in this.

202
00:22:30,208 --> 00:22:36,042
And then this is also a huge one
because a polygraph played such
a key role in her confession and

203
00:22:36,042 --> 00:22:40,792
for them discovering this was
going on. Remember they didn't
really suspect her. It was the

204
00:22:40,792 --> 00:22:46,792
Polly that caught it. This is
another one. I'm going tell you
a little bit about this guy

205
00:22:49,875 --> 00:22:55,958
first. I assuming most of you
are security professionals. If
you're not just pretend you are.

206
00:22:55,958 --> 00:22:59,375
I did this with my daughter.
I'm, like, tell me when
something just doesn't sound

207
00:22:59,375 --> 00:23:05,583
right. So you are at work one
day and at this big facility and
it's pretty sensitive stuff.

208
00:23:05,583 --> 00:23:10,750
It's not Target or 7 Eleven you
got sensitive stuff a lot of
people want to get at and you

209
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:16,750
are in charge of protecting it.
And we've got a delegation of
foreign scientists show up.

210
00:23:19,167 --> 00:23:23,792
Unannounced for some meeting
that that's not been planned
that you are aware of. Then one

211
00:23:23,792 --> 00:23:29,792
of your staff members saunters
through the lobby and says I'm
really good friends with one of

212
00:23:38,042 --> 00:23:44,042
these scientists. Okay, you
know, look at this a little
closer. Call in the people that

213
00:23:47,458 --> 00:23:53,042
do the forensic testing. And
they say, you know, did you know
that this dude's been, like, you

214
00:23:53,042 --> 00:23:56,375
know, all that sensitive data
you have on his network that's
not supposed to leave this

215
00:23:56,375 --> 00:24:02,375
network, he is backing up copies
to tape. Did you know this? So
you go you know what I am not

216
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:12,167
going to jump to conclusions but
I think you don't need to be on
this project until we get this

217
00:24:12,167 --> 00:24:17,375
sorted out. So you take him off
the project. Take his badge
away. Take his access away. No

218
00:24:17,375 --> 00:24:22,708
more network for you right. So
you are trying to get this all
sorted out and you got him over

219
00:24:22,708 --> 00:24:27,083
here and think you got him he
goes behind your back to another
division to his buddy and goes

220
00:24:27,083 --> 00:24:33,708
hey dude can I borrow your
computer. And he goes and gets
all the shit you took away from

221
00:24:33,708 --> 00:24:39,708
him and tapes it again. Red
flag. And then coincidentally
about eight years ago you find

222
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:50,500
out that he was actually
questioned by federal
investigators because he was

223
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:56,500
caught on a wiretap with another
dude that just got busted for
economic espionage. Spidy senses

224
00:24:59,542 --> 00:25:05,542
tingling yet? Here's this
gentleman. Mr. Wen Ho Li. What
he did was he worked for Los

225
00:25:08,917 --> 00:25:15,583
Alamos national lab. And his job
was to create simulations of
nuclear explosions. They studied

226
00:25:15,583 --> 00:25:21,000
the simulations to improve the
liability of the U.S. arsenal.
In March of '99 he was fired.

227
00:25:25,667 --> 00:25:30,667
The same exact day not sure if
they ever pinned down exactly
who gave the information to the

228
00:25:30,667 --> 00:25:38,083
"New York Times" but they ran
this huge story all over the
place. In December of '99 at a

229
00:25:38,083 --> 00:25:42,625
federal grand jury actually
indicted him for stealing U.S.
nuclear arsenal secrets and

230
00:25:42,625 --> 00:25:49,625
giving them to the people's
Republic of China. In September
of 2,000, a judge said, all

231
00:25:49,625 --> 00:25:57,042
right, if this goes to trial
everything on the tape needs to
be disclosed. So Louis Freeh and

232
00:25:57,042 --> 00:26:03,042
Janet Reno went oh. So they said
okay we got to plead the guy
out. So the whole deal with the

233
00:26:05,042 --> 00:26:11,208
plead out was to keep the data
from going public, obviously.
Then they also he had to tell

234
00:26:11,208 --> 00:26:16,667
them where the tapes had went
that he backed up. You know what
he said? I destroyed them.

235
00:26:16,667 --> 00:26:23,792
That's cool. It's all good. He
ended up pleading guilty to one
felony count of illegal

236
00:26:23,792 --> 00:26:30,083
retention of national defense
data. Then in 2006 he settled a
$1.6 million lawsuit against the

237
00:26:30,083 --> 00:26:35,292
U.S. government and five
different major media outlets
for dragging his name through

238
00:26:35,292 --> 00:26:41,292
the mud before he was indicted.
	The big question with him was,
was he an insider threat? If you

239
00:26:49,708 --> 00:26:55,833
read his book and listen to some
government accounts, everyone
was bending over backwards to

240
00:26:55,833 --> 00:27:01,750
apologize to this man for this
unfair treatment and how, you
know, okay we're sorry. But

241
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:09,125
you're security professional.
What do you think? Take out the
charges and what do you think?

242
00:27:09,125 --> 00:27:15,125
Was this guy a threat? There you
go. Okay this next guy is my
favorite dude. I love this guy.

243
00:27:23,625 --> 00:27:29,292
I got to tell you why I love
this guy. All right. So you old
school folks like me didn't

244
00:27:29,292 --> 00:27:34,167
always have, like, hard drive,
USB things to put, like, a
billion documents on and stick

245
00:27:34,167 --> 00:27:40,000
it in your pocket and walk out,
right. This guy was, like, total
old school. Everything he stole

246
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:46,000
was hard copy. Okay. And I have
seen pictures his house. Wow. He
was actually caught he had a

247
00:27:57,958 --> 00:28:03,958
high level clearance and he was
caught during the investigation
of another spy. For those who

248
00:28:11,083 --> 00:28:16,792
aren't familiar with him a
naturalized U.S. citizen,
engineer with a division of

249
00:28:16,792 --> 00:28:23,500
(inaudible). He was found guilty
in 2007 for conspiring to export
sensitive defense technology to

250
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:30,083
China. While they're going
through his house and all his
stuff, they find these two

251
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:35,833
letters talking about this other
guy. And, you know, the handlers
are basically, like, hey we know

252
00:28:35,833 --> 00:28:42,375
you don't have access to this
can you see if Greg can get it
for us? So they finally figure

253
00:28:42,375 --> 00:28:49,208
out who Greg is and they decide
to do some surveillance on his
house and take his garbage. He

254
00:28:49,208 --> 00:28:53,542
thought he was being pretty
clever because he was taking the
documents and putting them in

255
00:28:53,542 --> 00:29:00,708
the newspaper and putting them
in his trash. So there were five
searches of his trash between

256
00:29:00,708 --> 00:29:07,208
August and September of 2006 and
every single one they found
designs, drawing, diagrams,

257
00:29:07,208 --> 00:29:13,625
technical data, engineering
modification reports, stuff for
the space shuttle. I think he

258
00:29:13,625 --> 00:29:20,708
had a feeling they might be
looking at him because his buddy
CHI was in trouble. So he was

259
00:29:20,708 --> 00:29:26,583
trying to slide it in the trash.
Once they found all this
they're, like, we need to take a

260
00:29:26,583 --> 00:29:34,083
closer look at this guy which
they did. So I'm going to tell
you, as an investigator, the one

261
00:29:34,083 --> 00:29:40,083
thing I would love for you to
do, can you keep a journal of
everything you do. Because it

262
00:29:42,833 --> 00:29:48,833
makes it so much easier for me.
It's, like, you just write my
report for me. He kept a journal

263
00:29:51,458 --> 00:29:59,292
documenting everything. There's
really no way he could say, you
know, there's just no way. The

264
00:29:59,292 --> 00:30:03,208
journal was interesting because
it gave a lot of insight into
what he did and why. The big

265
00:30:03,208 --> 00:30:09,208
part of it was the modernization
project with China. Back more in
the 70s. It was China was, like,

266
00:30:13,625 --> 00:30:18,042
we need this technology. We need
to be competitive on the market.
We need to be economically a

267
00:30:18,042 --> 00:30:22,792
super power. If we can't come up
with the stuff or buy it we're
going steal it. And that was

268
00:30:22,792 --> 00:30:28,875
basically he wanted to help his
homeland. So he actually, like,
got a big bunch of stuff

269
00:30:28,875 --> 00:30:35,833
together and just sent it to a
university guy in China. And he
was, like, can you get us some

270
00:30:35,833 --> 00:30:41,833
more. Sure. Got you covered. So
eventually 300,000 pages of
documents were found in his

271
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:54,417
house. Project 863 is kind of a
newer version of more
modernization. Google it if you

272
00:30:54,417 --> 00:30:58,708
want to know more. This is a
picture of the outside of his
house. I've seen video of the

273
00:30:58,708 --> 00:31:04,792
inside. There was not a surface
area that wasn't covered in
stacks of paper. And he had a

274
00:31:04,792 --> 00:31:10,792
crawl space. It was, like, those
big metal shelves. I mean, it
was just amazing. You just got

275
00:31:13,833 --> 00:31:19,833
to respect the guy. He didn't
have a little stick. He took the
shit right. I was, like, damn.

276
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:29,458
Apparently I heard someone say
at one point when they looked at
it all he had the largest

277
00:31:29,458 --> 00:31:35,458
repository of space shuttle in
the world in his basement. One
of the things they found in his

278
00:31:40,167 --> 00:31:43,708
house during the search was a
(inaudible) list. When they
started giving him stuff they

279
00:31:43,708 --> 00:31:49,667
were can you please give us
this. They literally gave him a
grocery list of what they wanted

280
00:31:49,667 --> 00:31:53,875
and they would get it and bring
it back. This is just an example
of the kind of stuff he was

281
00:31:53,875 --> 00:31:59,667
handing over to them. There was
another tasking list. This is
the one that went when they were

282
00:31:59,667 --> 00:32:06,583
in Chi's home. They were going
through him because he didn't
have access to all the same

283
00:32:06,583 --> 00:32:12,583
stuff, so they were, like,
whatever they couldn't do he was
sub-contracting out to him. So

284
00:32:14,833 --> 00:32:20,708
this is the guy, this poor man.
I actually use this with my
daughter when she was learning

285
00:32:20,708 --> 00:32:25,458
how to spell. I'm like you don't
want to get a crappy nickname
from them jacking things up. He

286
00:32:25,458 --> 00:32:31,458
was literally known as the spy
who couldn't spell. I am not
kidding. I just started laughing

287
00:32:34,792 --> 00:32:40,792
the first time I read that.
Brian Patrick Regan not the
comedian, former Air force

288
00:32:42,917 --> 00:32:48,917
master sergeant. He was training
to fly in the Air force. This
occurred, like, '99 in to 2000.

289
00:32:52,167 --> 00:32:57,250
He was assigned NRO. He was a
signal intelligence specialist.
In '93 he was nearing the end

290
00:32:57,250 --> 00:33:02,875
'99 he was nearing the end of
his service. He was worried
about money because he was

291
00:33:02,875 --> 00:33:08,875
$117,000 in debt. He had four
kids to send to college. So he
did what all of us would do, he

292
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:21,500
wrote a letter to Saddam
Hussein. (Laughter) He said hey,
Saddam, I have some shit you

293
00:33:23,625 --> 00:33:29,625
might want. I'll give it to you
for $13 million. He also sent
letters to Libya and Cuba and

294
00:33:33,708 --> 00:33:40,083
China. So we had a foreign
source somewhere on one of those
who saw this letter and came

295
00:33:40,083 --> 00:33:45,500
back to us and said hey guys,
you got somebody trying to, you
know, get rid of your shit you

296
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:49,375
might want to check on this.
They couldn't figure out who it
was. All they had were the

297
00:33:49,375 --> 00:33:55,375
letters were horrible
misspellings. It was just really
bad. So literally when they were

298
00:33:59,167 --> 00:34:05,167
trying to find this guy they
were looking for the bad
speller. For those who had to

299
00:34:07,708 --> 00:34:13,708
read "of mice and men" some
accounts compare him to Lenny.
Literally they really did call

300
00:34:16,750 --> 00:34:22,667
him, like, people that said kind
of like Lenny. A bright guy but
had trouble communicating and

301
00:34:22,667 --> 00:34:29,000
said he always felt stupid and
he really struggled with writing
because he was dyslexic. So in

302
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:35,833
2001 the FBI arrested him at
Dulles airport on board a plane
getting ready to go to Zurich.

303
00:34:35,833 --> 00:34:42,625
He told his boss he was taking
the wife and kids to Disneyland.
He lied. When they arrested him,

304
00:34:42,625 --> 00:34:48,625
this is what he had on him. He
had stuff in his pocket. He had
classified papers. He had

305
00:34:54,250 --> 00:35:00,083
notebooks and cards and they
could not make heads or tails of
it. This is the other funny

306
00:35:00,083 --> 00:35:06,083
part. The NSA couldn't break any
of his stuff. Now to their
credit, 911 had just happened,

307
00:35:08,417 --> 00:35:13,417
they had other stuff on their
plate. This dude wasn't high on
the list of priorities. So this

308
00:35:13,417 --> 00:35:19,042
landed in the lap of an FBI
cryptic analyst named Daniel
Olson who managed to crack all

309
00:35:19,042 --> 00:35:25,917
this. Kudos to him. Good job.
What was interesting was that
Olson kind of was looking at

310
00:35:25,917 --> 00:35:30,333
dyslexic stuff and was figuring
out there was a technique some
of them use where they use

311
00:35:30,333 --> 00:35:35,125
pictures or words instead of
numbers to help things from
getting transposed in their

312
00:35:35,125 --> 00:35:41,125
mind. So, if you looked at these
words (inaudible) so he kind of
thought about them. Then he says

313
00:35:44,667 --> 00:35:50,667
you know what, five fingers,
one, three, five fingers, four
wheels on a car. So it was found

314
00:35:54,083 --> 00:36:00,125
near his AmeriTrade account
number in his AmeriTrade account
number and it worked. It was a

315
00:36:00,125 --> 00:36:06,125
pin code for the AmeriTrade
account. So they took this
theory and kind of applied it to

316
00:36:08,417 --> 00:36:15,083
all the other stuff they found
that was in this category of the
words. And they actually figured

317
00:36:15,083 --> 00:36:21,750
out we don't have the full sight
of the number but the first
three digits were Chinese

318
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:27,750
missile sites. So they were able
to go now we know what he is
doing here. The next in his

319
00:36:31,083 --> 00:36:36,458
wallet there was a paper with a
string of wallets. He was
inspired by the movie man hunter

320
00:36:36,458 --> 00:36:42,458
with Hannibal lector. So he used
the book code to do this Caesar
thing and it turned out to be

321
00:36:49,708 --> 00:36:53,875
addresses of Swiss banks so he
could put all the money his
buddy Saddam was going to give

322
00:36:53,875 --> 00:36:59,875
him over there. And then there
are these pages of notes, right,
and it took them a long time to

323
00:37:02,542 --> 00:37:08,458
figure this one out. Because
they couldn't get the key. So
finally he was trying to be a

324
00:37:08,458 --> 00:37:14,458
helpful guy, he ends up telling
them that there were 19 these
all ends up to be longitude GPS

325
00:37:17,417 --> 00:37:23,417
coordinates for the caches where
he buried the data. Originally
he stole this stuff and hid it

326
00:37:26,208 --> 00:37:32,542
in a locker but then he put it
in garbage bags and dug holes in
the ground and put it in there.

327
00:37:32,542 --> 00:37:37,125
In case you are wondering holes
in the ground and a garbage
ground are not authorizes

328
00:37:37,125 --> 00:37:43,125
storage methods for classified
materials. Trust me on that.
There were 19 caches total. 12

329
00:37:47,333 --> 00:37:54,917
in Virginia. At the state park.
Seven in Maryland. The state
park. And apparently he used the

330
00:37:54,917 --> 00:37:59,833
NRO phone list for the Virginia
ones. And his Virginia high
school yearbook for the ones in

331
00:37:59,833 --> 00:38:05,833
Maryland. Then he told the guys
they could also drive north on
95, exit 12 A, walk up the ramp,

332
00:38:09,042 --> 00:38:13,042
pick up the toothbrush container
he buried by the fence and it
had everything in plain text

333
00:38:13,042 --> 00:38:18,917
because he was worried he might
lose his papers and forget so he
wanted a backup which was buried

334
00:38:18,917 --> 00:38:24,917
in a toothbrush container on an
exit ramp on 95. So in Virginia
in that park they went out and I

335
00:38:29,750 --> 00:38:35,958
think he was messing with them.
Went out behind the trees and
they found the ones that he

336
00:38:35,958 --> 00:38:41,000
marked with nails and they dug
all these holes and couldn't
find it and he said dug on the

337
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:46,917
opposite side. They found it.
They went to Maryland and tried
to did the same thing and

338
00:38:46,917 --> 00:38:52,917
couldn't find it there. He goes,
well no the trees with the nails
I put it across from it.

339
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:01,458
Basically, you know, he's all
into the whole crypto thing. The
funny part I thought was he made

340
00:39:01,458 --> 00:39:08,458
it so complicated he ended up
forgetting it and he had to re
crack his own code. So learn how

341
00:39:08,458 --> 00:39:14,458
to spell kids. Or get a good
nickname. Current research. I'm
glad I have time to get to this.

342
00:39:20,333 --> 00:39:25,250
This first one is really
relevant especially with what
just happened to the general in

343
00:39:25,250 --> 00:39:32,625
Afghanistan. I ran across this
article and I included a link to
it. I honestly am not super up

344
00:39:32,625 --> 00:39:38,625
on the technology. I thought it
was really neat to put a
technical thing on this kind of

345
00:39:41,458 --> 00:39:48,250
non-technical concept. Are you
him? Dude that was awesome. If
you have questions about this,

346
00:39:48,250 --> 00:39:54,250
the dude is right here!
(Applause) So in a nutshell,
(inaudible) flow, algorithm,

347
00:40:06,042 --> 00:40:12,042
they say, you know >> (Off mic).
>> Come on! (Applause) >> I
planned this. >> (Off mic). >>

348
00:40:32,833 --> 00:40:38,875
That kind of makes more sense
right? Look at that. That's
crazy. This is, like, really

349
00:40:38,875 --> 00:40:43,833
modern shit. Okay so the guy he
was a counter intelligence agent
named Bill Snell. What he

350
00:40:43,833 --> 00:40:51,708
figured out was that if you are
looking at an image that has you
have some emotional attachment

351
00:40:51,708 --> 00:40:57,708
to, then you send off this
really big signal out of a
portion of your brain. And so

352
00:41:02,333 --> 00:41:08,208
what they did was first they put
this helmet on you. And it's an
no it's MRI. They're looking at

353
00:41:08,208 --> 00:41:14,208
electromagnetic activity that
comes out of your brain. They
were going to take a bunch of

354
00:41:18,083 --> 00:41:24,083
Iraqi troops and also Afghan
troops, put this helmet on them
and first, you know, establish a

355
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:33,833
baseline then start showing them
pictures that if they were a
potential insider threat they

356
00:41:33,833 --> 00:41:37,750
would have an emotional
attachment toward, like, the
picture of a particular person

357
00:41:37,750 --> 00:41:43,708
that they may have come in
contact with, a picture of a
particular place that only an

358
00:41:43,708 --> 00:41:50,417
insider threat would possibly
know. So this way, because your
brain sends out this signal far

359
00:41:50,417 --> 00:41:58,125
too fast for you to attempt to
hide it or officate it then
using the data they were getting

360
00:41:58,125 --> 00:42:04,333
from this helmet they would know
if you are lying far more
effectively than if you had to

361
00:42:04,333 --> 00:42:10,208
explicitly lie. But you didn't
have to actually say anything.
You didn't have to go ahead and

362
00:42:10,208 --> 00:42:15,917
do the whole lie. Your brain was
indicating your familiarity
emotionally with a picture or

363
00:42:15,917 --> 00:42:20,375
with a subjects that was a
telltale sign of your insider
threat. So what they're trying

364
00:42:20,375 --> 00:42:28,167
to do right now is sell this
actually in Afghanistan and Iraq
to U.S. military so they can

365
00:42:28,167 --> 00:42:32,750
stick them on troops that are
with the Afghan or Iraqi
military that we're working with

366
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:38,750
to pre detect potential insider
threats. (Applause) >> Thank
you. There's a link to his

367
00:42:46,542 --> 00:42:51,708
article at the bottom of the
slide. So you can probably link
on that and get his contact

368
00:42:51,708 --> 00:42:56,792
information or, you know, maul
him after this. I'm sure he
doesn't mind. This one's really

369
00:42:56,792 --> 00:43:03,542
neat. This is plagiarism
algorithm detection. So I'm so
old when I wrote my papers for

370
00:43:03,542 --> 00:43:09,083
college the first time I did it
in long hand. Right. You got
extra credit if you typed your

371
00:43:09,083 --> 00:43:16,625
paper. So what this is I just
recently finished master's
graduate work and everything I

372
00:43:16,625 --> 00:43:23,042
did I had to do this turn it in
thing. Has anyone done this? So
this is kind of cool. It takes

373
00:43:23,042 --> 00:43:28,833
your paper and it runs it past
everything on the planet
apparently and in two seconds it

374
00:43:28,833 --> 00:43:35,625
can figure out this report. And
it kind of gives you a
familiarity thing. So, like, you

375
00:43:35,625 --> 00:43:40,917
have to turn the report in with
your paper to your professor to
know you haven't basically

376
00:43:40,917 --> 00:43:45,792
copied the whole thing and
plagiarized it. Really kind of
neat I thought. But what some

377
00:43:45,792 --> 00:43:51,750
kind figured out to do is you
can use the same theory instead
of running it past you are going

378
00:43:51,750 --> 00:43:57,750
to look at emails leaving your
facilities or your sites or your
organization. Because, you know,

379
00:44:02,375 --> 00:44:08,375
maybe Greg Chung can get 300,000
pages out but, you know, people
may be more hesitant now.

380
00:44:08,375 --> 00:44:12,792
They're like I can just email it
to my house right and nobody
will catch me going out the back

381
00:44:12,792 --> 00:44:19,875
door with it. So what this does
is it takes all the emails, puts
them through a filter. And it

382
00:44:19,875 --> 00:44:25,500
does, like, the same type of
algorithm. You can set a
threshold for your intellectual

383
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:30,250
property. To look at every
email. If anything hits the
threshold where you are, like,

384
00:44:30,250 --> 00:44:37,458
wait a minute we don't want all
that leaving you can set it to
alert but let it go so you can

385
00:44:37,458 --> 00:44:43,458
look into it. Or if there's a
lot, it can go that is not going
anywhere. You can actually stop

386
00:44:46,417 --> 00:44:51,833
the email before it even leaves.
This was really interesting. I
have a whole sources section

387
00:44:51,833 --> 00:44:56,833
where I cited (inaudible) and
back. I just finished graduate
work so everything is cited and

388
00:44:56,833 --> 00:45:02,833
this whole paper is listed. Then
the last one, a couple years ago
this gentleman presented a black

389
00:45:06,333 --> 00:45:12,500
hat on (inaudible) forensics. Is
anyone familiar with that? No.
This is so cool if you are into

390
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:18,917
math. So he is looking from a
forensic perspective at your
computer usage. If you sit down

391
00:45:18,917 --> 00:45:26,167
and use your computer every day
it's a baseline for how you act
and what you do. If you are

392
00:45:26,167 --> 00:45:31,708
copying large masses of things
that changes your pattern.
Because suddenly it's not your

393
00:45:31,708 --> 00:45:35,833
normal baseline. They can go
back and look at this and maybe
not necessarily use it for

394
00:45:35,833 --> 00:45:41,833
evidence. But it could be an
indicator of something you might
need to look at closer. It is a

395
00:45:43,917 --> 00:45:49,292
very technical paper and I can
just write snort rules now. I'm
not to this other level. But if

396
00:45:49,292 --> 00:45:56,208
you are read at this level check
it out and there's interviews
with him and articles. So point

397
00:45:56,208 --> 00:46:02,208
you in that direction. Are we
good on time? Two minutes. Okay.
Really fast. Mitigation. Funny

398
00:46:04,708 --> 00:46:08,167
cartoon my guy gave me but it's
really sad at the same time
because it's true. Communication

399
00:46:08,167 --> 00:46:15,625
and awareness, oh my gosh that's
a whole other presentation.
We'll do that next year. These

400
00:46:15,625 --> 00:46:20,167
are some of the organizational
factors they found that are
really the biggest contributors

401
00:46:20,167 --> 00:46:27,125
to whether or not you have more
potential threat. The ease of
which people can get stuff out

402
00:46:27,125 --> 00:46:31,708
of your organization. How you
handle disciplinary things. You
know, do you actually have

403
00:46:31,708 --> 00:46:37,708
consequences for bad behavior or
do you just kind of ignore it or
blow it off? Then what can we

404
00:46:37,708 --> 00:46:43,750
do? Big thing is support your
security people. Support the job
they're trying to do not just

405
00:46:43,750 --> 00:46:49,750
with attaboys but money if they
need it. (Applause) And, you
know, you need to work with your

406
00:46:56,708 --> 00:47:04,375
people. They're not, like,
tokens on a chess board. They're
people. You need to understand

407
00:47:04,375 --> 00:47:07,625
them. And you need to understand
what makes them tick. And you
need to understand how that can

408
00:47:07,625 --> 00:47:15,167
affect your organization if they
start ticking wrong. I think I
am out of time. What do you do?

409
00:47:15,167 --> 00:47:21,417
Call someone trusted, your
general counsel, your legal
department, your, what do they

410
00:47:21,417 --> 00:47:27,417
call it what do government
people call it? The hotlines.
Whatever those numbers are. And

411
00:47:30,792 --> 00:47:36,833
then sources. On the slide, you
should have all this. I gave you
pretty much everything I

412
00:47:36,833 --> 00:47:42,833
researched. So anyway, thank
you. (Applause)
