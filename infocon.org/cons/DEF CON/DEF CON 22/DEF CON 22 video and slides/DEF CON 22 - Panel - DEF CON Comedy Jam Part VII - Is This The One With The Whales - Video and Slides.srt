1
00:00:00,167 --> 00:00:06,167
>> So, ladies and gentleman,
without further ado or anymore
horrible jokes -- [Yelling] >>

2
00:00:08,458 --> 00:00:13,625
One out of two ain't bad! >> I
said anymore for Christ's sake
ok. I'd like to introduce the

3
00:00:13,625 --> 00:00:19,625
7th, I repeat 7th, God knows why
-- annual Fail Panel of Def Con.
With the amazing august

4
00:00:21,708 --> 00:00:27,708
personages that are on it. And
the amazing august personages
willing to heckle them. [Cheers

5
00:00:33,667 --> 00:00:40,292
and Applause] >> Thanks everyone
for coming -- yet again to yet
another Fail Panel. [Laughter]

6
00:00:40,292 --> 00:00:43,375
>> As one of my lovely
colleagues pointed earlier that
means you all have sat through

7
00:00:43,375 --> 00:00:50,500
12 straight hours of fail, over
the last few years. We're amazed
you keep coming back honestly.

8
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:56,125
>> We're failing! >> You've
failed to not come back it's
true. So, I'm going to start off

9
00:00:56,125 --> 00:01:00,500
with -- we actually had an epic
panel fail ourselves, which was
-- those of you who've come in

10
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:04,833
the past well know for the past
four or five years, or more I've
lost count, we have made waffles

11
00:01:04,833 --> 00:01:10,375
on stage. [Cheering] >> Yeah,
and the fail turns out, you
know, it turns out that

12
00:01:10,375 --> 00:01:16,375
producing food without a license
is against health code. >>
That's a fail. >> Yeah. Oops. >>

13
00:01:19,958 --> 00:01:27,667
Oops! >> It's true, but, it's
what passes for food in many
restaurants. So, it's close

14
00:01:27,667 --> 00:01:32,000
enough for the government. But
it also turns out it violates
Def Con's contract with the

15
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,000
hotel. And that's less good. >>
Boo! >> That's a fail. And the
other thing -- [Accordion plays]

16
00:01:40,042 --> 00:01:44,542
>> Thank you, Thank you.
[Laughter] >> You should feel
free to donate money to the EFF,

17
00:01:44,542 --> 00:01:51,917
just for playing that. We did
talk to the hotel and we got
special permission this year, to

18
00:01:51,917 --> 00:01:58,417
give out donuts in exchange for
EFF donations and so -- because
they don't produce donuts at the

19
00:01:58,417 --> 00:02:04,667
hotel so they very generously
allowed us to slide around a bit
on the contract, so we have

20
00:02:04,667 --> 00:02:09,875
several -- I lost count, how
many? What is it 90 some donuts?
From the delightful Krispy

21
00:02:09,875 --> 00:02:15,875
Kreme. [Cheering] >> We do
however have two very special
waffles that Rich is going to

22
00:02:18,208 --> 00:02:24,208
talk about. >> Are they blue?
[Laughter] >> Shut up now
Gillis. >> I'm going to tell you

23
00:02:29,167 --> 00:02:33,583
a little bit about the waffles
because these are some very
special waffles that we produced

24
00:02:33,583 --> 00:02:40,417
that do not violate any
contracts. Except for the social
ones. >> So Chris Hoff has been

25
00:02:40,417 --> 00:02:46,417
on this panel since the start.
He's now crying on an airplane
back home due to severe back

26
00:02:46,417 --> 00:02:51,750
injury, nerve pinching, whatever
else. And when we found out we
can actually have waffles here

27
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:57,333
this year -- we'll we could, but
I won't go into that. We asked
Chris -- he's got a bunch of

28
00:02:57,333 --> 00:03:04,542
maker bots because he runs Hack
Kid. So, we are going to be
auctioning off the last two ever

29
00:03:04,542 --> 00:03:10,542
fail waffles. [Cheers and
Applause] >> We have the stealth
fail waffle and the Vegas fail

30
00:03:18,958 --> 00:03:25,083
waffle. [Laughter] >> So, Jamie
can you stand up and show your
back to the audience. We are

31
00:03:25,083 --> 00:03:32,000
going to do this as a silent
auction. So whoever wants to
donate just put your donation

32
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,292
amount pound fail panel, we'll
see where we end up in the next
two hours. All the money is

33
00:03:37,292 --> 00:03:43,667
going to go to a good cause, the
EFF and some other tech related
charities. That's it. So.

34
00:03:43,667 --> 00:03:50,500
[Applause] >> Tag your Tweets,
whether you want the Vegas
waffle or the uber waffle. The

35
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:56,500
uber waffle does get you free
admission to the fail panel for
life though. [Laughter] >> For

36
00:04:00,042 --> 00:04:05,500
what's it worth, Rich and I will
be on the fail panel at SecTor
in Toronto. >> We will? >> Think

37
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:11,042
about that. >> Nobody told me.
[Laughter] >> Well we knew you
were coming to Toronto so. >>

38
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:17,042
Surprise! [Laughter] >> Right am
I up? >> You are up. Alright,
so. Put money in this bag and

39
00:04:22,542 --> 00:04:28,542
then take a donut. Now. >> Say
it again. >> Now! >> Put money
in the bag, take a donut. This

40
00:04:31,167 --> 00:04:35,125
is all for good causes. >> We
can't handle separate
instructions for you. Don't

41
00:04:35,125 --> 00:04:41,125
forget a donut. [Jeopardy theme
plays] [Laughter] >> I'm the
Hacker pyramid guy! Pyramid!

42
00:04:52,042 --> 00:04:58,042
[Laughter] >> Christ sake. >> If
we get enough donations, Rob
Graham will roll around in the

43
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:06,833
money as I take a picture. >> Oh
wow! >> I'm not an analyst,
that's an analysts job.

44
00:05:33,417 --> 00:05:36,917
[Laughter] [Theme from National
Lampoon's Vacation plays]
[Cheers and Applause] >> Can I

45
00:05:36,917 --> 00:05:42,917
have some fries with that shake?
>> There are lessons to be had
from Clark W. Griswold. In order

46
00:05:55,417 --> 00:06:00,792
to tell the story of Clark W.
Griswold I felt that I had to
live the story of Clark W.

47
00:06:00,792 --> 00:06:06,792
Griswold. And take the road less
traveled. It is a long God dam
drive from Ontario Canada to Las

48
00:06:09,875 --> 00:06:15,875
Vegas. [Laughter] >> If you run
the math you figure you're going
to spend about 4K and it's going

49
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:26,917
to take about 10 hours if you
fly. Plus someone's going to
touch your junk and you have to

50
00:06:26,917 --> 00:06:33,875
take off your shoes. If you
drive -- I'm sorry I had to do
all the math in metric because I

51
00:06:33,875 --> 00:06:39,833
still cannot puzzle out what the
hell a mile is. [Laughter] >>
It's going to run about 317

52
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:45,833
bucks. But it takes 35 hours.
I'm thinking that I'd rather
have the 3,500 and change to

53
00:06:49,417 --> 00:06:55,417
spend on the trip and I can sit
in the car for a long time,
can't I. In Infosec we tell you

54
00:06:58,875 --> 00:07:04,958
to leave your comfort zone all
the time. Try saying, yes when
someone asks you if they can do

55
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:12,083
something. It's crazy talk, I
know. For the last couple of
years I've been traveling for a

56
00:07:12,083 --> 00:07:16,958
higher percentage of the time
then I was promised when I
agreed to work at the company.

57
00:07:16,958 --> 00:07:22,958
My ass is shaped like the seat
of a 737. >> Yeah it is!
[Laughter] >> Love this thing.

58
00:07:28,417 --> 00:07:32,417
When you think about the family
truckster. What's the first
thing that comes to mind? That

59
00:07:32,417 --> 00:07:40,208
great quote, "Never
underestimate the bandwidth of a
station wagon full of backup

60
00:07:40,208 --> 00:07:46,208
tapes" [Laughter] >> We don't
have family trucksters anymore,
except we do. I'm a dad. I have

61
00:07:48,583 --> 00:07:54,583
a whole passel of kids. I drive
a mini-van. Fuck you, it's
black. [Laughter] >> It can be

62
00:07:56,917 --> 00:08:03,083
configured as a two-seater.
While configured as a two-seater
it provides an opportunity to

63
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:10,875
make more kids. [Laughter] >>
I've driven to conferences
before. This is a nice short

64
00:08:10,875 --> 00:08:17,542
four hour drive to Cleveland.
For Nauticon where the river's
not on fire anymore. Shmoocon

65
00:08:17,542 --> 00:08:23,375
even, it's like 8 hours. We
drove into and out of the
Shmoopocolypse in a mini-van.

66
00:08:23,375 --> 00:08:29,375
[Laughter] >> Even Derbycon is
not that far. Surprisingly it's
only about 40 minutes further

67
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:39,750
than Shmoocon. Done that twice.
No big deal, piece of cake
right? Here's the easy part, the

68
00:08:42,833 --> 00:08:50,375
first 7 hours of the drive
really don't impact me that
hard. Because I married a girl

69
00:08:50,375 --> 00:08:56,375
from Chicago and I've done that
trip about 150 times. [Laughter]
>> Someone in the audience is

70
00:09:01,792 --> 00:09:07,792
calling me an idiot. Day 1. Yeah
just one. Day 1. It's going to
be a heck of a drive, we have to

71
00:09:14,083 --> 00:09:20,083
get all the way to Joliette. I
have to leave my house for three
weeks. I've never been away from

72
00:09:22,708 --> 00:09:28,708
home for three contiguous weeks.
I'm afraid. All my stuff is in
there. >> Rock and Roll!

73
00:09:35,083 --> 00:09:41,125
[Laughter] >> We get to the
first regulatory hurdle.
Regulatory hurdles are fun. I

74
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:46,625
totally love the US customs and
border patrol. >> And they love
you. >> Let me say it again one

75
00:09:46,625 --> 00:09:52,625
more time. I love the US customs
and border patrol. They're the
best. You're starting to

76
00:09:56,625 --> 00:10:02,833
understand how this talk links
you up to Infosec doesn't it.
Yeah. They're the best at what?

77
00:10:02,833 --> 00:10:07,500
You got regulatory hurdles every
time you turn around, right?
Sometimes they're scary. You

78
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:12,750
might wear an orange jump suit.
Sometimes they just suck, you
might lose your house. Sometimes

79
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:18,750
you look stupid. I'm doing that
right now. Regulatory hurdles
not so bad. Coolest part of this

80
00:10:20,833 --> 00:10:28,125
particular regulatory hurdle,
you're leaving Canada and going
to Detroit. [Laughter] >> I love

81
00:10:28,125 --> 00:10:34,125
Detroit. >> Thank you. >> The
thing is, I still have to work.
So occasionally I do a little

82
00:10:36,792 --> 00:10:43,375
bit of driving, but mostly I am
dependant on others. Yes, you
can participate in a Con call in

83
00:10:43,375 --> 00:10:50,833
the back of a mini-van doing,
ummm will call it 70 miles an
hour across the mid-west.

84
00:10:50,833 --> 00:10:56,833
Totally do-able. The best part
of this, you can have bad cell
service. [Laughter] >> I love

85
00:11:02,542 --> 00:11:07,000
this particular Water Tower.
It's like every now and then
something just smiles at you.

86
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:12,125
It's a lot like that at Infosec
isn't it. You sort of have to
work in shitty cramped

87
00:11:12,125 --> 00:11:18,125
conditions. Every now and then
you get a smile. Yeah. We drove
through the middle. >> Middle of

88
00:11:21,208 --> 00:11:29,083
what? >> The middle. [Laughter]
>> For half an hour, I didn't
have to touch the steering

89
00:11:29,083 --> 00:11:35,083
wheel. [Laughter] >> It was
awesome. >> What were you
touching? [Laughter] >> It's

90
00:11:41,208 --> 00:11:46,333
like I -- >> Now you know why he
loves -- >> -- other people
answer them, it's awesome. We

91
00:11:46,333 --> 00:11:52,333
went from Ontario, to Michigan,
to Indiana, to Illinois. >> I'm
sorry. >> For which part? >> All

92
00:11:55,083 --> 00:12:02,583
of it. >> Yes, the answer is
yes. >> Don't worry it gets
worse. >> It get worse is --

93
00:12:02,583 --> 00:12:08,583
slightly, but your bang on. Day
two, now you're in the middle of
your progression here. It should

94
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:17,042
only take three days, right? >>
Wait did you go through Iowa? >>
Yeah I went through Iowa. I'll

95
00:12:17,042 --> 00:12:20,000
tell you a story about Iowa in a
minute if you quit jumping ahead
for fucks sake. [Laughter] >>

96
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:27,292
The first part was the easy
part. Done it before, a million
times. Now we're going through

97
00:12:27,292 --> 00:12:31,417
-- I don't know really how to
describe sort of the western
part of the mid-west. You know,

98
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:37,750
I'm accustomed to sort of banjo
country in the mid-south. Now
we're into a place where -- they

99
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:44,667
spend way too much time with
cows. [Laughter] >> Way to much
time with cows. Again, we've got

100
00:12:44,667 --> 00:12:50,875
to kill a big chunk of the
country here, we're going from
Joliette to Grand Island. It's

101
00:12:50,875 --> 00:12:56,042
do able. There's two seasons in
this part of the country. Winter
and construction. [Laughter] >>

102
00:12:56,042 --> 00:13:02,958
The trick is, you need to
survive the construction
especially the completely

103
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:08,958
meaningless obstructions. Here's
a closed lane. Went on for 2 and
a half miles. How much

104
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:21,167
construction was happening in
that 2 and a half mile stretch?
>> None! >> Nothing. This is

105
00:13:21,167 --> 00:13:26,208
again a perfect allegory for the
God dam life that you live when
you're in the middle of trying

106
00:13:26,208 --> 00:13:33,750
to mature your Infosec program.
Meaningless obstruction for no
good reason because someone has

107
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:40,917
some spare barrel cones to put
in your way. [Applause]
[Laughter] >> I love you Jack

108
00:13:40,917 --> 00:13:46,917
Daniel. >> Illinois, Iowa,
Nebraska. At the rest stops in
Nebraska they have metal TPs. I

109
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:07,500
know it is so racially
sensitive. Apparently other
things happen at rest stops in

110
00:14:10,208 --> 00:14:16,208
Nebraska too. Speaking from
experience are we? [Laughter] >>
Probably. Day three. We need to

111
00:14:20,458 --> 00:14:28,417
get out of Nebraska get into
Utah. Trying to figure out how
many spare wives and or Alex

112
00:14:28,417 --> 00:14:35,375
Huttons I can pick up on the
way. [Laughter] >> And
hopefully, survive. The road

113
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:41,375
gets twisty as you go through
Colorado you know. When you're
going through this part of the

114
00:14:41,375 --> 00:14:49,250
country you've got to question
all of your preconceptions. You
have a lot of preconceptions.

115
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:55,250
Everyone has preconceptions that
they try and dump on you. What
do you do about it? Well, when

116
00:14:58,792 --> 00:15:04,417
it's an Aztex in your rearview
mirror and you're driving
through the middle of America,

117
00:15:04,417 --> 00:15:10,542
you start to wonder how much of
the meth you are going to have
to buy. [Laughter] >> There's

118
00:15:10,542 --> 00:15:16,875
some level of expectation that
you are going to be ingesting
the meth. You don't have to if

119
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:24,208
you don't want to. We got
through Nebraska. We got through
the mountains of Colorado. If

120
00:15:24,208 --> 00:15:30,208
you're going to -- >> I was in
the car. [Laughter] >> I may or
may not have been having trouble

121
00:15:41,667 --> 00:15:45,125
with oxygen deprivation as we
crossed the continental divide
and I may or may not have been

122
00:15:45,125 --> 00:15:48,583
conscious for that part of the
drive. We're not talking about
that though. >> Are there any

123
00:15:48,583 --> 00:15:51,458
family therapists or divorce
lawyers in the house. [Laughter]
>> Could be useful. We're

124
00:15:51,458 --> 00:15:59,083
supposed to take three days. And
we ended up taken three and a
half. We stayed in a hotel in

125
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:05,625
the Fish Lake National Forrest.
To help you with definitions
here again because sometimes

126
00:16:05,625 --> 00:16:11,625
definitions get used wrongly in
Infosec, there is no fish, there
is no lake, there is no forrest.

127
00:16:14,458 --> 00:16:20,250
[Laughter] >> You're in the
badlands of Utah. There are no
plants. When the sign says there

128
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:27,833
are no services for 120 miles on
this road, they're not kidding.
>> One remember -- In the

129
00:16:27,833 --> 00:16:34,708
mid-west we name place after
places we've killed, removed or
bulldozed. [Laughter] >> And a

130
00:16:34,708 --> 00:16:38,292
request to the audio tech in the
back if you could bring up all
the mics on the panel table that

131
00:16:38,292 --> 00:16:45,042
would be great please. >> Oh,
you guys are allowed to be
heard? Ok. >> You're in trouble

132
00:16:45,042 --> 00:16:51,042
now. >> Oh! >> There is no right
way. [Laughter] >> I've
determined. Every time you turn

133
00:16:56,625 --> 00:17:04,125
around there's someone telling
you that the way you chosen is
the wrong way. >> Isn't that

134
00:17:04,125 --> 00:17:10,125
marriage. >> Oh, Boo! >> Too
soon! [Laughter] >> No, quit
trying to have me assassinated

135
00:17:20,375 --> 00:17:26,250
you fuckers. [Laughter] >> He
gets himself in enough trouble.
>> There's no right way,

136
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:32,083
especially if someone else's
opinion is important. And let me
tell you, this group,

137
00:17:32,083 --> 00:17:38,083
opinionated bastards the lot of
them. This gets -- shut up. Are
you working? >> Not really. >>

138
00:17:41,958 --> 00:17:49,250
Ok quiet working. Goons are
noisy. Get through Utah. You go
through the tiniest little

139
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:55,958
smidge of Arizona where
everything clenches up. And
finally you get to Nevada and

140
00:17:55,958 --> 00:18:01,583
you start the long decent into
Las Vegas. This is both
figurative and literal.

141
00:18:06,292 --> 00:18:11,250
[Laughter] >> I've determined
that the only way to succeed is
to try. Even if it means coming

142
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:17,250
back to Vegas every year. Eating
shitty hotel food, committing
myself to too many projects,

143
00:18:19,292 --> 00:18:25,292
hanging out with some of my best
friends. And hoping to God it
all gets better at the end. And

144
00:18:27,542 --> 00:18:33,542
that's it folks. [Applause] >>
Just wait. [Music playing] >>
Don't encourage him please.  >>

145
00:18:58,708 --> 00:19:03,583
[Laughter].  >> Yes, we do need
musical accompaniment.  >> I
think you goes are wrong, the

146
00:19:03,583 --> 00:19:09,583
cameras for videotaping this is
actually behind us. It's you
guys on the panel they were

147
00:19:15,542 --> 00:19:21,542
taking a photograph of.  >>
[Laughter].  >> Told you this
was only going to get better.

148
00:19:31,083 --> 00:19:37,083
 >> [Laughter].  >> All right.
So Telidi -- oh no yes, you did
it.  >> We're up to $100 bid for

149
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:45,250
the uber waffle. 25, 35, 40.
Another thing falling on the
floor -- 40  >> [Laughter].  >>

150
00:19:55,167 --> 00:20:01,167
10% discount!  >> All right. So
after that brief interlude. All
right, so a little about me, you

151
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:12,958
probably have heard quite a bit.
Just wait, just wait. So I'm a
penetration tester and hardware

152
00:20:12,958 --> 00:20:19,208
hacker with a great group called
InGuardians, I'm an HAM radio
operator and I wasn't sure if he

153
00:20:19,208 --> 00:20:25,208
was able to make it up here, but
I had a huge thank you to Mr.
Cutaway who was my partner.  >>

154
00:20:30,792 --> 00:20:35,042
Yes, oh, yes. As you can see
from the screen shot from the
application we're going to

155
00:20:35,042 --> 00:20:39,167
discuss shortly, we have a
friend request from my partner
Cutaway and he helped me do a

156
00:20:39,167 --> 00:20:45,167
whole lot of bunch of stuff. It
was kind of awkward explaining
to my wife that I had a partner

157
00:20:49,083 --> 00:20:55,917
and it was a guy with a really
big beard. So Don, again, thank
you for spending time with me

158
00:20:55,917 --> 00:21:01,167
working on this. We spent many
--.  >> A guy with a really big
beard who plays the banjo.  >>

159
00:21:01,167 --> 00:21:07,167
Wow, yes.  >> And a hat.  >> So
we spent many an evening in a
hotel room.  >> [Laughter].  >>

160
00:21:10,333 --> 00:21:16,333
Doing hacking capture analysis
and data recovery, yeah. That's
what we're calling it now. And

161
00:21:19,458 --> 00:21:26,875
maybe a little penetration. All
right.  >> And some burping.  >>
Burping. So this whole

162
00:21:26,875 --> 00:21:32,875
Telidildontics things, it's a
term coined by a gentleman name
Ted Nelson in 1975. Now here is

163
00:21:36,333 --> 00:21:41,375
a guy that was really ahead of
his time. And he is incredibly
sexy, he is the first guy I want

164
00:21:41,375 --> 00:21:47,375
to think about when I think of
Telidildontics. It's an
electronic sex toy that can rep

165
00:21:52,458 --> 00:21:58,458
your computer reach orgasm. The
woman in the top row, sexy
librarian glasses.  >>

166
00:22:10,583 --> 00:22:16,583
[Laughter].  >> We travel a lot
for our jobs, give me a break.
So episode 363 of false security

167
00:22:20,167 --> 00:22:27,917
weekly, we interviewed Pat
talking about 3D printing. And
she does sex toys. We wanted to

168
00:22:27,917 --> 00:22:33,917
bring it back to the whole
security thing and of course
this whole thing about

169
00:22:33,917 --> 00:22:39,917
Telidildontics comes up and she
mentioned to us on the podcast a
new product called, the Vibies.

170
00:22:49,167 --> 00:22:54,875
Yes, it's actually as great as
it sounds.  >> It's the victim.
 >> So this is our victim for

171
00:22:54,875 --> 00:23:01,792
this hack. They have a new
product to market. They have
both an Android and I-device

172
00:23:01,792 --> 00:23:08,000
model. They were initially at
$79 now they're at $99 and after
the introductory price they will

173
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:14,000
be at $119.  >> [Off mic].  >> I
know, just wait. But wait,
there's more! That's not all

174
00:23:17,083 --> 00:23:23,083
that we do. So it's pretty neat
concept. It is a personal
massager that connects to your

175
00:23:27,625 --> 00:23:34,000
mobile device over Bluetooth.
Don is scratching his forehead
right now. And so Bluetooth star

176
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:41,875
and there are a couple different
devices. One specifically for
Android and one specifically for

177
00:23:41,875 --> 00:23:47,875
IOS for iPhone or iPad and it
integrates with an app you can
install for chat, picture

178
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:56,250
transfer and remote control.
Okay. So there were some delays
in the development for the

179
00:23:58,583 --> 00:24:03,833
I-device. They were developed
independently, which is a kind
of odd. Part of the reason

180
00:24:03,833 --> 00:24:10,167
because of this was that the
newer I-devices support
Bluetooth low energy, so they

181
00:24:10,167 --> 00:24:14,042
had a different chip for the
Bluetooth low energy version.
The Bluetooth low energy version

182
00:24:14,042 --> 00:24:20,042
is yet to be released because
the chip set they swapped in the
middle of production and didn't

183
00:24:23,208 --> 00:24:28,000
tell them there was a difference
and the battery life was only
good for 2 hours, whether in use

184
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:34,000
or not. So they had to go back
to the drawing board and reset
the whole process. It was

185
00:24:37,833 --> 00:24:44,542
supposed to be released July
30th. I'm still waiting on mine.
Yes, I bought two, I brought the

186
00:24:44,542 --> 00:24:51,042
Android and the I-device. Yes,
hardware is hard. All right. So
what did we find with some of

187
00:24:51,042 --> 00:24:58,917
our early stuff? Yes, go Google
image search Telidildontics. On
the third page, there's a

188
00:24:58,917 --> 00:25:04,917
picture of Kevin Mitnic going
like this.  >> [Laughter].  >> I
won't talk about what was on the

189
00:25:09,583 --> 00:25:15,583
first two, okay?  >> [Off mic].
 >> [Laughter].  >> You do know
how to whistle, don't you?  >>

190
00:25:19,167 --> 00:25:26,958
Yeah.  >> We started looking at
the Android traffic because they
were shipped to us. All of the

191
00:25:26,958 --> 00:25:33,083
traffic was encrypted to the
various services, however the
app is still available for the

192
00:25:33,083 --> 00:25:39,083
I-devices. So we started looking
at the Android standard
Bluetooth. The I-device is

193
00:25:44,542 --> 00:25:52,333
allegedly Bluetooth low energy,
which is all sorts of fail. We
suspect it's using

194
00:25:52,333 --> 00:25:56,292
[indiscernible] which if you've
seen any of Mike Ryan's talk,
you would know that was a full

195
00:25:56,292 --> 00:26:02,292
fail. It was supposed to have
been released already, but is
not. However, you can still chat

196
00:26:05,208 --> 00:26:11,208
from an I-device from an Android
device. And we're going to be
doing a little bit of that.  >>

197
00:26:13,458 --> 00:26:20,833
Way more than chatting.  >> Oh,
yeah. Yes, sir?  >> So he has
normally, again, a very special

198
00:26:20,833 --> 00:26:28,458
episode of chat, normally we
chat two speakers, but today
we're going to celebrate very,

199
00:26:28,458 --> 00:26:34,458
very old speakers.  >>
[Applause].  >> All right. How
many people have never seen the

200
00:26:55,583 --> 00:27:03,417
failed panel before? Yeah about
20% of you. This fucking thing's
been going on since dinosaurs

201
00:27:03,417 --> 00:27:09,417
roamed the Earth and I asked
Rich and he said, what the fuck.
 >> It's always the last year.

202
00:27:19,667 --> 00:27:25,667
 >> So if you gentlemen would
like to create -- if someone
wants to do --.  >> [Off mic].

203
00:27:35,625 --> 00:27:41,125
 >> [Laughter].  >> Do we have
to do everything around here?
 >> If we could bring some of

204
00:27:41,125 --> 00:27:47,125
that over here because frankly,
I don't think I have enough.  >>
All right.  >> [Off mic].  >>

205
00:27:50,833 --> 00:27:53,625
[Laughter].  >> It's always good
when the Goon says, ooooh!  >>
[Off mic].  >> You should know

206
00:27:53,625 --> 00:27:59,625
Paul, since you are changing the
rules, you have to participate.
 >> No.  >> [Laughter].  >> [Off

207
00:28:12,042 --> 00:28:18,042
mic].  >> What are you doing?
 >> [Laughter].  >> Oh, sure,
sorry. So --.  >> When the field

208
00:28:24,542 --> 00:28:30,542
panel gets their shot --.  >>
And by the way, if anybody has a
shout out there --.  >> [Off

209
00:28:38,125 --> 00:28:44,125
mic].  >> Yeah.  >> Anybody
shooting the [indiscernible]
will be shot.  >> These people

210
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:53,500
are crazy!  >> [Off mic].  >> By
the way, for those of you who
have not seen the field panel

211
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:59,500
before, this is pretty much it.
 >> [Laughter].  >> It doesn't
get any better.  >> [Applause]

212
00:29:01,917 --> 00:29:07,917
[cheers].  >> May the Gods go
with you because nobody else
will.  >> [Laughter].  >> That's

213
00:29:20,458 --> 00:29:26,458
really good. [Laughter].  >> If
I knew it was this good, I would
have told them years ago it was

214
00:29:31,625 --> 00:29:35,708
my first time speaking. I would
have told them every time it's
my first time speaking. Is that

215
00:29:35,708 --> 00:29:41,708
it?  >> No.  >> I barely
remember this one.  >> [Off
mic].  >> Thank you, Paul.  >>

216
00:29:51,542 --> 00:29:58,500
Now back to Telidildontics. So
the Android and the I-device
applications were significantly

217
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:04,500
different much the Android
traffic was well encrypted,
however the I-device traffic was

218
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:10,542
not, even though we didn't have
the vibrator attachment. So we
started doing protocol analysis

219
00:30:10,542 --> 00:30:16,542
and started looking at all of
data. It turns out it's all XMP
traffic. And it was developed by

220
00:30:19,625 --> 00:30:25,625
a third party and used by folks
such as the BBC and others. It
also uses http for image

221
00:30:32,167 --> 00:30:35,667
reference and download.  >>
[Laughter].  >> So we decided to
sniff a little traffic and we

222
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:39,458
really were sniffing traffic in
our hotel room. We had an open
access point, wire shark and all

223
00:30:39,458 --> 00:30:44,125
sorts of good stuff. So Android
to jabber traffic was encrypted
for all the log-in, however the

224
00:30:44,125 --> 00:30:50,625
device to the jabber traffic was
not. We were able to capture all
of the authentication, the

225
00:30:50,625 --> 00:30:57,375
images, so forth and so on.
Yeah. All right. So the focus
was on our I-device to jabber

226
00:30:57,375 --> 00:31:03,458
traffic. And we had a couple
thing we wanted to attempt. We
wanted to be able to chat from a

227
00:31:03,458 --> 00:31:08,292
desktop. We wanted to enumerate
pictures. And see if we could
enumerate and send messages and

228
00:31:08,292 --> 00:31:13,000
ultimately see if we could make
it by with something that's
outside of their application.

229
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:17,250
All right. So it's all jabber,
right? Great. We took a known
username and password for the

230
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:19,250
service and plugged it into a
desktop client and it didn't
work. It failed. It wouldn't log

231
00:31:19,250 --> 00:31:21,458
in. So I captured, Don and I
captured a session in an open
access link and found that the

232
00:31:21,458 --> 00:31:23,458
jabber user and a password were
patented together and encoded.
 >> I really hope they require

233
00:31:23,458 --> 00:31:25,458
them to have a longer password
than that.  >> Yeah, but it's
not longer than that.  >>

234
00:31:25,458 --> 00:31:27,458
Because size doesn't matter!  >>
[Laughter].  >> So by using a
password in a desktop jabber

235
00:31:27,458 --> 00:31:29,458
client, we have 4 encoded
username and password. However,
it takes the password and does

236
00:31:29,458 --> 00:31:31,458
some other unknown encoding.
However, if you take that other
unknown encoded value out of the

237
00:31:31,458 --> 00:31:33,458
screen and plug it into your
desktop client, it works just
fine. So you plug that encoded

238
00:31:33,458 --> 00:31:35,458
stream into your desktop jabber
client and you're now able to
authenticate to the jabber user.

239
00:31:35,458 --> 00:31:38,875
So we now have a client. So now
let's see if we can add multiple
partners to our client. However,

240
00:31:38,875 --> 00:31:42,333
Vibies only allows you to have
one partner at a time.  >>
Ooohh!  >> Not available in

241
00:31:42,333 --> 00:31:48,333
Utah!  >> [Laughter].  >> So
it's time to go back to jail,
apparently. But what we find is

242
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:12,500
when you want to add another
client since he we were testing
with multiple users, with

243
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:30,000
multiple partners, we were very
promiscuous. When we added
another test account, the

244
00:33:40,125 --> 00:33:46,125
partner that was dropped
received an e-mail that says,
hi, this is Vibies, your vagina

245
00:33:48,875 --> 00:33:54,875
is no longer a partner with you.
Yes, I own the Vibies client
name of "your vagina." Okay? But

246
00:33:59,375 --> 00:34:06,000
what we observed during each one
of the sessions every time a
chat was enabled was that an HTC

247
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:12,000
request was given to an ACP
server to get the users profile.
Within that users profile lists

248
00:34:17,375 --> 00:34:23,750
the partner. Okay? So if I'm
Don's partner, it will list that
I'm his partner and he's my

249
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:29,750
partner. So now if they are
dropped, maybe we can figure out
whose partners are which. We can

250
00:34:37,417 --> 00:34:44,625
capture the session key and
replay it and change the partner
every time. It is not exclusive

251
00:34:44,625 --> 00:34:50,625
it the user you are attempting
to look up. Nor is it unique for
requests. So --.  >> Why is

252
00:34:53,875 --> 00:34:59,875
someone calling me?  >> Just say
no. So who cares, right? So
every time we drop a partner and

253
00:35:04,458 --> 00:35:09,833
get a new partner, the person
that we dropped gets a
notification. Okay? So maybe

254
00:35:09,833 --> 00:35:14,292
they are two-timing.  >> Why
don't you just use a burner
laptop?  >> Why don't I just use

255
00:35:14,292 --> 00:35:19,417
a burner laptop?  >> Yeah,
because then you can have two
different accounts.  >> You do

256
00:35:19,417 --> 00:35:23,667
have bifurcation, don't you?  >>
No.  >> When can tell when
someone asks the speaker a

257
00:35:23,667 --> 00:35:29,667
question they have never thought
of it before, why don't I use a
burner laptop?  >> [Laughter].

258
00:35:33,833 --> 00:35:39,833
 >> So you get the message that
your vagina is no longer your
partner and that means likely

259
00:35:46,708 --> 00:35:52,708
your vagina has another partner.
So we replay it and ask for the
profile for your vagina and it

260
00:35:58,042 --> 00:36:04,042
will list your vagina's new
partner. Great!  >> Great.  >>
[Laughter].  >> So up on the top

261
00:36:11,792 --> 00:36:17,958
left we have a stock request as
captured from Burt and the
username request for getting a

262
00:36:17,958 --> 00:36:24,333
profile for your vagina. It
responds with a nickname of
action makers. Action makers

263
00:36:24,333 --> 00:36:30,333
drops your vagina and picks up a
new partner, DEF CON 22. So sure
enough, action makers has a new

264
00:36:35,792 --> 00:36:41,792
partner. So we can do partner
enumeration.  >> We can start
asking for every username or

265
00:37:00,250 --> 00:37:05,833
maybe go and make some educated
guesses about some user names
that we should guess.  >> Such

266
00:37:05,833 --> 00:37:11,208
as some maybe listed on this
slide. Okay?  >> [Laughter].  >>
Don't do this -- or do this at

267
00:37:11,208 --> 00:37:17,208
home.  >> [Laughter].  >> It
also does pictures.  >>
[Laughter].  >> Girls for the

268
00:37:21,375 --> 00:37:28,833
win? All right. So the jabber
session also does picture
sharing. It says, hey, has this

269
00:37:28,833 --> 00:37:34,833
file name been used? If not, it
uploads it and download it is to
the client with HTP. The prep

270
00:37:37,792 --> 00:37:43,875
reserves a 20 character image
name of -- with some unknown
authentication method using

271
00:37:43,875 --> 00:37:51,708
upper and lower and numeral key
space. So a couple of image file
names there as well. And it

272
00:37:51,708 --> 00:37:57,708
requires a session for retrieve.
But if you're in a valid chat
session, you can generate a

273
00:37:59,875 --> 00:38:04,792
valid session token and it's
valid for every image you
request, it doesn't expire, it's

274
00:38:04,792 --> 00:38:11,000
not unique for image. We
attempted to reverse engineer
the Android app. We spent 5 or 6

275
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:17,000
hours in a hotel room trying to
reverse engineer the Android
app. It was a complete utter

276
00:38:19,708 --> 00:38:25,708
failure.  >> And because pulling
in the third party jabber app,
the libraries didn't decompile

277
00:38:30,792 --> 00:38:38,625
our initial attempt. So all of
the IDs it compiled, but not for
the jabber app. So we found some

278
00:38:38,625 --> 00:38:44,042
authentication that the HP
client was using but not the
jabber client which was

279
00:38:44,042 --> 00:38:51,958
associated with the file.  >> So
we can do potential image
enumeration by capturing a token

280
00:38:51,958 --> 00:38:57,958
and ask for 20 characters. Don't
do it! There are things on the
Internet that cannot be unseen.

281
00:39:03,792 --> 00:39:09,792
Including pterodactyl porn.  >>
And the wireless router this
time, it's not big enough.  >>

282
00:39:35,125 --> 00:39:42,917
[Laughter]. Shrinkage.  >>
That's what she said.  >> We do
improve the concept with a

283
00:39:42,917 --> 00:39:50,875
couple of imagines that we owned
and download and we did those,
but quite frankly we ran out of

284
00:39:50,875 --> 00:39:54,625
time and, well, didn't want to
see any more. All right. So,
yeah, great, it echoes, it

285
00:39:54,625 --> 00:39:58,083
vibrates, it feels good. So what
was the last goal? Let's make
this one go to 11. So we

286
00:39:58,083 --> 00:40:04,083
captured a session of control of
the vibrator remotely between
two applications. It turns out

287
00:40:16,625 --> 00:40:21,375
all of the controls when you
capture it from the I-device to
a jabber device that has an

288
00:40:21,375 --> 00:40:29,042
attached vibrator, all of the
messages are in plain text. Oh,
that feels good! Lower!  >>

289
00:40:29,042 --> 00:40:32,208
Capture the session is the new
code word.  >> [Laughter].  >>
We're going to go reverse

290
00:40:32,208 --> 00:40:38,208
engineer and capture the session
in our hotel room later, honey.
 >> So all of the messages to

291
00:40:42,333 --> 00:40:47,625
trigger vibrations on the remote
device are all plain text,
fairly standard format and

292
00:40:47,625 --> 00:40:54,667
messages with 5 different
profiles and custom pulse
settings so you can increase or

293
00:40:54,667 --> 00:41:02,500
decrease -- oh, man! I got red
carded.  >> [Laughter].  >> Can
I get one of those, please? Keep

294
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:10,333
them coming. Okay with no Vibies
attached to an Android device,
as Don found out with his phone,

295
00:41:10,333 --> 00:41:18,042
it vibrates the phone.  >>
[Laughter].  >> Whoo!  >> So is
that the vibrator in your pocket

296
00:41:18,042 --> 00:41:24,042
or just your phone?  >> Many of
you know I'm a Twitter troll and
what I will do is get on

297
00:41:28,250 --> 00:41:34,250
Twitter, troll some people and
put my phone in my pocket and
for the next hour I'm getting

298
00:41:36,792 --> 00:41:41,667
messages from other people
pinging back and forth and back
and forth vibrating my pocket.

299
00:41:41,667 --> 00:41:49,208
 >> What a very sad life you
lead.  >> You are saying this
like it's a bad thing.  >> It's

300
00:41:49,208 --> 00:41:55,208
the only action I get these
days.  >> [Off mic].  >>
Apparently we do. That's okay.

301
00:41:59,125 --> 00:42:03,458
So in order to take remote
control of the vibrator, it does
require permission from the two

302
00:42:03,458 --> 00:42:09,458
partners. We have a request made
to the person on the controller
to the quote victim and what we

303
00:42:13,333 --> 00:42:17,708
found out through the testing,
we intercepted some of the
messages and I accidentally sent

304
00:42:17,708 --> 00:42:23,708
an accept before a request was
sent.  >> [Laughter].  >> Can we
have some more creeper cards up

305
00:42:37,958 --> 00:42:43,958
here, please?  >> All right. So
here is a sample question -- oh,
wow. Here take this.  >>

306
00:42:51,625 --> 00:42:57,750
[Laughter].  >> All right. So we
have a chat question from myself
and Don Cutaway. We send some

307
00:42:57,750 --> 00:43:03,750
vibes. We do an accept some
vibes, some more accept, some
more vibes, and all sorts of

308
00:43:07,750 --> 00:43:13,750
good stuff such as too soft and
mix it up. So the last message
is a whole bunch of 11s. It

309
00:43:18,167 --> 00:43:24,167
turns out if you send too many
11s to the Android app, what
does it do? It crashes.  >> [Off

310
00:43:26,833 --> 00:43:31,958
mic].  >> [Laughter].  >> It
can't handle the truth.  >> So
you're saying this one does not

311
00:43:31,958 --> 00:43:36,958
go to the 11?  >> It does but
only for a short time.  >>
That's deeply disappointing.  >>

312
00:43:36,958 --> 00:43:42,958
Yes, I know.  >> A couple of
command lists, we can do a vibe
request to control, we can do an

313
00:43:45,750 --> 00:43:52,042
accept as a response back, a
reject so if Don doesn't allow
me to control his vibrator,

314
00:43:52,042 --> 00:43:58,125
that's fine. We can end the
session by revoking control and
then we do some custom names

315
00:43:58,125 --> 00:44:03,625
including a pause, which from
what I found is optional.  >>
[Laughter].  >> We sent some

316
00:44:03,625 --> 00:44:10,750
interesting vibe comments, 00
are pauses and we can do all
sorts of fun stuff. Now the

317
00:44:10,750 --> 00:44:16,125
question is --.  >> Enough
foreplay, we want to see the
demo.  >> Okay.  >> [Laughter].

318
00:44:16,125 --> 00:44:21,708
 >> Now we'd love to be able to
spoof messages. I really wanted
to revisit Dave's experience,

319
00:44:21,708 --> 00:44:29,667
but the problem is the request
for controlling the vibrator
gets in the way. So what we did

320
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:35,667
first was figured we'd show is
you a video of this vibrating
all over the place.  >>

321
00:44:39,250 --> 00:44:43,833
[Laughter].  >> So actually, you
can't hear the sound on this,
but this is sitting in the room

322
00:44:43,833 --> 00:44:51,333
with us and first we pulled out
and he was like, what the fuck?
And then we made it vibrate and

323
00:44:51,333 --> 00:44:56,208
he is cackling in the
background, cannot control
himself.  >> Literally and

324
00:44:56,208 --> 00:45:03,292
figuratively. If you remember in
many years past, I have always
interested you guys to some very

325
00:45:03,292 --> 00:45:08,000
interesting music video because
now we have you all hot and
bothered.  >> Wait, all of this

326
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:14,000
is just to get to your main
video?  >> No. So here's the
video and I'm going to fast

327
00:45:18,125 --> 00:45:25,167
forward this a little bit, but
apparently this band is a real
thing. The band is called Hefty

328
00:45:25,167 --> 00:45:31,167
Hideaway.  >> [Music] I was
walking through the forest, I
didn't do it --.  >> So I have a

329
00:45:35,333 --> 00:45:39,917
special thing, we're going to
donate to hackers for charity
over to the silent auction. This

330
00:45:39,917 --> 00:45:43,458
woman is interesting. She sells
great shirts.  >> [Music] I was
already --.  >> [Applause].  >>

331
00:45:43,458 --> 00:45:49,458
I'm not associated with this. I
am not associated with this.  >>
Wait for it! Wait for it! You

332
00:45:59,375 --> 00:46:05,250
are all hot and bothered now,
right? Okay. This is going to be
in your minds forever. Watch out

333
00:46:05,250 --> 00:46:12,083
for my body rolls.  >> [Music]
I'm a dance floor tiger, laying
out everything she has. Touching

334
00:46:12,083 --> 00:46:18,500
every single tag,  >> She
apparently smokes lots of crack.
 >> [Music] watch out for my

335
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:24,500
body rolls. Watch out for my
body rolls. This is how we do
it. Watch out for my body rolls.

336
00:46:26,542 --> 00:46:34,167
Watch out for my body rolls.
High kick, high kick.  >> If
with do this next year, you is

337
00:46:34,167 --> 00:46:40,167
need to match this up with Afro
Circus is all I'm saying.  >>
Say that again.  >> You need to

338
00:46:42,458 --> 00:46:48,833
match this up with Afro Circus
if we do this again next year.
 >> All right, so let's do the

339
00:46:48,833 --> 00:46:54,833
quick demo.  >> Finally, all the
foreplay is over and we see the
demo.  >> However, we do need a

340
00:47:00,167 --> 00:47:06,167
volunteer.  >> [Applause].  >>
And you have to play for the
privilege of the EFF.  >> He's

341
00:47:11,292 --> 00:47:17,292
trying to connect.  >> Trying to
connect.  >> I think it worked.
 >> Searching for it.  >> While

342
00:47:22,750 --> 00:47:28,750
we're all waiting for Larry to
get it up  >> [Laughter].  >>
You can still bid for a waffle,

343
00:47:31,958 --> 00:47:37,958
that would be good.  >> Get
online.  >> Come on, Larry.  >>
Stretch it a little. Stretch it

344
00:47:41,292 --> 00:47:47,292
a little.  >> Control me. I'm
going to play with myself while
he's waiting.  >> [Laughter].

345
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:15,000
 >> [Vibrating]  >> [Laughter].
 >> I like whales!  >>
[Laughter].  >> [Vibrating].  >>

346
00:48:20,542 --> 00:48:26,542
I want to! I want to!  >> I've
already asked to control your
massager. Stop typing, come on.

347
00:48:37,583 --> 00:48:43,583
Stop typing.  >> [Off mic].  >>
[Laughter].  >> Where is my
chunky Monkey? All right, the

348
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:54,000
request was granted and --  >>
[Off mic].  >> Ooh!  >> [Off
mic].  >> It did.  >> You went

349
00:49:00,208 --> 00:49:07,792
for 12, 13 and 14.  >> Larry, as
you get older, this occasionally
happens, it's all right. There's

350
00:49:07,792 --> 00:49:15,708
pills you can take now.  >> I
heard I can get them from
Canada.  >> That's where you go

351
00:49:15,708 --> 00:49:21,708
for your cheap meds and your
hard...alcohol.  >> It's broken
honey. Do I need to call tech

352
00:49:27,458 --> 00:49:33,458
support? How awkward would that
be?  >> [Laughter].  >> [Off
mic].  >> We've been trying to

353
00:49:36,583 --> 00:49:42,583
turn it on all day.  >> Ooh!  >>
You all note as a married man, I
was in and out in less than 10

354
00:49:45,417 --> 00:49:51,417
minutes, right?  >> All right,
guys, request.  >> Hit me. Hit
me.  >> Come on, make it work.

355
00:49:58,875 --> 00:50:04,875
 >> Okay, we have some other
entertainment while they're
working on that.  >> Press

356
00:50:09,042 --> 00:50:15,375
control/alt/delete.  >> There
are some very special fortune
cookies that somebody brought in

357
00:50:15,375 --> 00:50:21,375
the audience.  >> I just wanted
a hug.  >> All right. Well, with
that, that was lots of fun.  >>

358
00:50:29,958 --> 00:50:35,958
Pull out the cookies, don't get
nervous.  >> Seriously, do you
really want to bend over up

359
00:50:43,375 --> 00:50:49,375
here? We have a vibrator.  >>
It's a Telidildontics.  >> Hurt
me.  >> I'm not receiving.  >>

360
00:50:59,333 --> 00:51:05,333
Hold on, hold on. Ready?  >> You
know why?  >> Oh, you just
revoked it!  >> Connect.  >> Oh,

361
00:51:26,833 --> 00:51:32,833
here we go, we're connected.
Let's go! This guy has to come
back next year.  >> [Laughter].

362
00:51:37,042 --> 00:51:43,042
 >> Ready? Request. Accept. Take
it, bitch! Give it to me.  >>
These are security cookies.  >>

363
00:51:49,667 --> 00:51:55,667
Yay!  >> [Applause].  >> Let's
make this bitch go to 11!  >>
[Vibrating].  >> You know, that

364
00:52:03,083 --> 00:52:09,083
really sounds like a
[indiscernible] to me.  >> Do
you want to hold it?  >> [Off

365
00:52:13,875 --> 00:52:17,750
mic].  >> All right, who is
next? Who is the next victim?
 >> What do you think?  >> I'm

366
00:52:17,750 --> 00:52:25,208
just not impressed. But I say
that a lot.  >> Oooh!
 >> Actually, I gave it to my

367
00:52:25,208 --> 00:52:32,750
wife, I set it on the lowest
setting and she said, what? And
then I put it on high and she's

368
00:52:32,750 --> 00:52:38,750
like, that's okay.  >> You've
done better. Okay, next victim.
 >> So the top bid for the Vegas

369
00:52:44,333 --> 00:52:46,833
waffle is currently 60 bucks.
You all can do better than that.
 >> [Off mic].  >> Oh!

370
00:52:46,833 --> 00:52:52,833
[Laughter].  >> [No audio].  >>
Oh, yeah!  >> Robert, how is
your pocket, there buddy?  >>

371
00:53:48,583 --> 00:53:54,583
It's not vibrating yet.  >> Hey,
all of the electronics are down
there blocking the signal.  >>

372
00:54:04,292 --> 00:54:11,375
[Laughter].  >> Unfortunately,
my laptop has to be rebooted.
 >> [Off mic].  >> At this

373
00:54:11,375 --> 00:54:15,625
juncture, I'm the only one who
has done a talk without
mistakes, errors or stupid.

374
00:54:15,625 --> 00:54:21,625
Apart from driving from Hamilton
to Las Vegas. I did drive for
about a third. It's not Martin

375
00:54:34,500 --> 00:54:39,375
McCay sticking up for my wife. I
think I'm going to be walking
home.  >> [Off mic].  >>

376
00:54:45,333 --> 00:54:50,167
[Laughter].  >> Does anybody
have a spare red card? I could
use a spare red card.  >> [Off

377
00:54:52,542 --> 00:54:59,667
mic].  >> [Laughter].  >> 12!
 >> [Off mic].  >> [Laughter].
 >> Have you tried turning it

378
00:54:59,667 --> 00:55:05,667
off and back on again?  >> So
one of the problems with
security is that I have a

379
00:55:09,250 --> 00:55:14,708
password for the login for my
user account, I have a 30
character password to

380
00:55:14,708 --> 00:55:22,417
[indiscernible] the hard drive,
which means sleeps works well,
but when I have to reboot it,

381
00:55:22,417 --> 00:55:28,417
it's like, fuck, I can't
remember that 30 character
password.  >> [Off mic]  >> I

382
00:55:34,417 --> 00:55:40,417
have wonderful [indiscernible].
 >> [Off mic].  >> [Off mic].
 >> Did you say you need

383
00:55:53,333 --> 00:55:59,333
twerking on the stage? She says
no.  >> [Laughter].  >> Hang in
there, baby.  >> That's not

384
00:56:13,542 --> 00:56:19,542
distressing, is it?  >> Come on!
 >> What's great is when they
pulsate this thing.  >> Ready?

385
00:56:35,708 --> 00:56:41,708
You can't handle the truth.  >>
So having this thing actually
vibrate in your pocket actually

386
00:56:47,833 --> 00:56:53,833
is distracting.  >> [Laughter].
 >> So I did this really
[indiscernible] thing last year

387
00:57:14,167 --> 00:57:20,167
where I did this talk at a
conference where they have like
experts in passwords and what

388
00:57:22,417 --> 00:57:28,417
they did was, so I logged in
with the screen showing during
the login, and it was a 6

389
00:57:30,625 --> 00:57:36,500
character password and it was
really great. And everyone
laughed at me because only a 6

390
00:57:36,500 --> 00:57:41,292
character password. But it was
great because, you know, with
all of the networking turned off

391
00:57:41,292 --> 00:57:49,042
and the hard drive encryption,
it doesn't matter it was only a
6 character password. So it was

392
00:57:49,042 --> 00:57:55,042
great. And my friend was
presenting on misconception of
passwords and that was a great

393
00:57:57,042 --> 00:58:03,042
misconception.  >> [Off mic].
 >> That's what she said.  >>
But the consequence of having a

394
00:58:15,750 --> 00:58:21,750
separate account to beef up the
hard drive and the one to have
your normal account is that --

395
00:58:25,083 --> 00:58:31,083
 >> this stuff is screwed up.
 >> Well --.  >> So the moral of
the story is, as with security,

396
00:58:35,750 --> 00:58:41,333
if you try to be too clever, you
just screw yourself up.  >> The
password screen is a screen

397
00:58:41,333 --> 00:58:47,333
called unlock that I'm unlocking
the hardware with and then I log
into a completely separate

398
00:58:51,625 --> 00:58:57,625
account.  >> [Off mic].  >>
Almost there, almost there.  >>
Yay! Ooh!  >> [Cheering].  >>

399
00:59:03,875 --> 00:59:09,875
Can we do the wave? I tried to
get the wave done at Black Hat
and no one would do it. And/or

400
00:59:24,583 --> 00:59:30,583
the chicken dance.  >> Okay.
Activation! Woo hoo! I never use
this account so I don't --.  >>

401
00:59:44,500 --> 00:59:50,500
Would you like to share your
experience with Microsoft?  >>
[Laughter].  >> Congratulations,

402
00:59:57,458 --> 01:00:03,458
you're ready!  >> Oh, my God,
this is really hard!  >>
[Cheering].  >> Well, there's

403
01:00:11,292 --> 01:00:17,292
your problem right there!  >>
[Off mic].  >> Why are you using
PowerPoint?  >> Because I'm an

404
01:00:20,875 --> 01:00:26,875
idiot.  >> You made a monitor
reboot.  >> Are you the APT?  >>
So, yeah, we have a fail here

405
01:00:39,458 --> 01:00:45,458
 >> Stop touching yourself!  >>
Maybe we should get somebody
technical over there, he says.

406
01:00:56,000 --> 01:01:02,000
 >> You guys are old enough to
remember Windows NT, right? It
worked better than this.  >>

407
01:01:14,583 --> 01:01:20,583
[Applause].  >> It's working.
 >> Don't touch it!  >> Don't
even!  >> The death rattle of

408
01:01:32,708 --> 01:01:38,708
the fail panel.  >> [Laughter].
 >> It's on TRD.  >> [Off mic].
 >> Is this the directory to

409
01:01:50,333 --> 01:01:56,708
user?  >> Here's the funny part,
we're actually gaining audience
while this is happening.  >>

410
01:01:56,708 --> 01:02:02,792
[Laughter].  >> So here's how it
works, I'm the CEO of security,
so therefore, I'm going to have

411
01:02:02,792 --> 01:02:09,750
my tech support guy handle the
problem for me. And
unfortunately, I doubt that he

412
01:02:09,750 --> 01:02:15,750
can actually help me.  >> Dave
was the best you could do for
tech support?  >> I've just been

413
01:02:25,542 --> 01:02:31,000
informed we're an hour into the
presentation and nobody who
started the presentation with

414
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:37,000
pants has lost them.  >>
[Laughter].  >> Maynor is
standing up.  >> [Off mic].  >>

415
01:02:40,958 --> 01:02:46,958
No, but Rich is and usually they
are brothers in pantlessness.
 >> Does anybody else have their

416
01:03:02,167 --> 01:03:07,625
talk done?  >> I have a low tech
talk.  >> You have a low tech
talk?  >> I do.  >> We could be

417
01:03:07,625 --> 01:03:11,708
entertaining the audience.  >>
Who would like to help me do
something that actually works?

418
01:03:11,708 --> 01:03:17,708
 >> [Applause].  >> Give me the
vibrator.  >> Sometimes low tech
is better according to her.  >>

419
01:03:30,167 --> 01:03:36,167
All right, I need five
volunteers from the studio
audience. Come on up!  >> [Off

420
01:03:41,458 --> 01:03:44,500
mic].  >> [Laughter].  >> All
right. Thank you. Everybody turn
around --.  >> So you're going

421
01:03:44,500 --> 01:03:50,375
to do someone else's
presentation while I figure this
out?  >> Turn around and face

422
01:03:50,375 --> 01:03:56,083
the audience.  >> [Off mic].  >>
No, no, no turn around and face.
Now all of you are going to be

423
01:03:56,083 --> 01:04:02,083
voting on this, so pay close
attention, all right? The first
-- the thing that I want you to

424
01:04:07,792 --> 01:04:13,792
do, okay, get ready.  >> [Off
mic].  >> Get ready for this.
What I need you to do is make a

425
01:04:18,750 --> 01:04:24,750
sound like a modem. Now if
anybody here does not know what
one is, you may leave and be

426
01:04:27,250 --> 01:04:33,542
replaced by somebody who does.
 >> Jack, sit down!  >>
[Laughter].  >> Just so we know

427
01:04:33,542 --> 01:04:39,542
it can be done, I'm not in the
contest, but I will start.  >>
Do you have the name the modem?

428
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:50,125
 >> No, you don't have to name
it, but you do know the sound.
There is a prize involved, so do

429
01:04:50,125 --> 01:04:56,125
area best.  >> What's the prize?
 >> You have negotiate.  >>
What's the frequency, Kenneth?

430
01:05:02,375 --> 01:05:08,375
 >> I will go first to show it
can be done, the sound like a
modem, bee, bee, yeaw, yeaw.  >>

431
01:05:32,417 --> 01:05:39,000
[Applause].  >> [Off mic].  >>
That was a solid 300 bod
connection. As I remember it, my

432
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:45,000
modem sounded like this.
[Silence]  >> [Laughter].  >>
But I was on Verizon.  >> Oooh!

433
01:05:51,042 --> 01:05:57,042
 >> No, no, you can't cheat with
the equipment. That's what I
said.  >> Errr, ewoooewooo,

434
01:06:02,542 --> 01:06:08,542
sweeeeoooo.  >> We have yet to
get a B52 modem here. How about
a 42 IS?  >> Hey, Martin, go

435
01:06:28,042 --> 01:06:34,042
back to Europe.  >> [Laughter].
 >> Beeeeeep, beeep, squuuuu,
beeee, squuuu, beeep.  >> ATH.

436
01:06:57,250 --> 01:07:03,042
 >> [Applause].  >> This is back
from my youth. Your free AOL
trial has expired.  >>

437
01:07:03,042 --> 01:07:09,042
[Laughter].  >> Beep. Mom, hang
up the phone! Hang up! No, hang
up the phone!  >> [Applause].

438
01:07:17,333 --> 01:07:23,333
 >> All right! Okay. So now we
need a vote from the studio
audience.  >> Is Drew the

439
01:07:34,500 --> 01:07:40,500
winner?  >> [Applause].  >> All
right, all right.  >> [Off mic].
 >> This is the fail panel. Fail

440
01:07:49,875 --> 01:07:55,875
panel.  >> [Off mic].  >> Yes,
he is the proud recipient of a
not quite new in box USR Courier

441
01:08:08,917 --> 01:08:14,917
modem.  >> All right, so --.  >>
[Off mic].  >> So there's
something you folks need to know

442
01:08:23,917 --> 01:08:29,917
about me. When we started this
fail panel 7 years ago I was
kind of a newlywed, no kids,

443
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:39,583
really enjoying life.  >>
[Laughter].  >> It was a lot of
fun. Now I have three kids, ages

444
01:08:39,583 --> 01:08:46,875
5, 3, and 1. One of which takes
double cover age due to his
ability to climb up on things

445
01:08:46,875 --> 01:08:52,875
and fall off of them. And I just
work and the kids and at the end
of the day all I want is my 44

446
01:08:59,250 --> 01:09:05,583
minutes of solace in front of
the television. So my wife and I
sit down and watch a show, and

447
01:09:05,583 --> 01:09:11,583
look, we don't always make the
best decisions in life and -- it
got better. It really did. Like

448
01:09:14,917 --> 01:09:22,000
the first half of the season,
fucking horrible, Scott, oh, I
can hack anything. Ah!  >> It

449
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:28,375
did not get better, Rich. I
checked. You made this claim
earlier this week. I validated

450
01:09:28,375 --> 01:09:30,917
and you're wrong.  >> I liked
the end of the season.  >> [Off
mic].  >> [Laughter].  >> So

451
01:09:30,917 --> 01:09:36,917
we're sitting there and it's
kind of one of those nice and
we're watching a show and the

452
01:09:39,875 --> 01:09:45,875
show ends and I did that one
thing you should never do when
you watch your last show after

453
01:09:45,875 --> 01:09:50,958
eating your shitty microwave
dinner on the couch before going
to bed, I checked my e-mail.

454
01:09:53,167 --> 01:09:57,333
Amazon web services, action
required, your Amazon is
compromised. It's a fishing

455
01:09:57,333 --> 01:10:03,333
attack. So some things went
through my head, kind of involve
that. Tour de France? Okay, you

456
01:10:12,375 --> 01:10:18,375
have to watch the video. There's
a video of this. Wait, wait,
wait. So this guy, the pinnacle

457
01:10:23,542 --> 01:10:29,542
of his athletic career, he gets
run over with by a car and
thrown into a barbed wire fence.

458
01:10:35,542 --> 01:10:41,542
And you know what, he finished
the race looking like -- oh, I
can't remember that part.

459
01:10:44,208 --> 01:10:51,417
Anyway.  >> [Off mic].  >> You
saw it? Yeah, right there. So
anybody thinks that cyclists are

460
01:10:51,417 --> 01:10:57,417
pussies, you need to pick a
different sport to criticize. So
back to the presentation. So

461
01:10:59,708 --> 01:11:06,667
then I said that and I'm like,
oh, fuck, my Amazon got hacked.
My wife is not only technical,

462
01:11:06,667 --> 01:11:10,458
but she knows what I did for a
living so she didn't think we
would get large deliveries of

463
01:11:10,458 --> 01:11:16,458
toilet paper over the next
couple of days. We did, but we
ordered it, fuck Cosco. So I go

464
01:11:18,500 --> 01:11:24,500
to my desk and sign into my
account and I say, I'm screwed,
I need to fix this now. And the

465
01:11:32,458 --> 01:11:39,833
embarrassing thing is I teach
cloud security for Black Hat. I
developed security and I'm kind

466
01:11:39,833 --> 01:11:45,833
of fucked. So I go to my
incidence response checklist and
I go in and the first thing I do

467
01:11:49,500 --> 01:11:56,625
is revoke my access key. And I
lucked out because this was my
route account. And it was a test

468
01:11:56,625 --> 01:12:01,500
account -- not a test account,
but one I used for random work.
If you don't know anything about

469
01:12:01,500 --> 01:12:07,042
Amazon, if somebody gets your
route account, you end up like
[indiscernible] and it doesn't

470
01:12:07,042 --> 01:12:13,208
go well for you. So I went into
the route account, revoke the
credentials and checking the

471
01:12:13,208 --> 01:12:17,750
services. Checking services on
Amazon to find out where you
have been hacked is because

472
01:12:17,750 --> 01:12:23,375
these are all the services and
there's like 9 regions and you
have to click on every screen in

473
01:12:23,375 --> 01:12:30,750
every region to figure out
what's deployed. I cheated and
went to the billing queue. No

474
01:12:30,750 --> 01:12:36,750
unexpected charges but the
number was not $34. And I
checked for running instances. I

475
01:12:45,500 --> 01:12:52,750
went to other regions and all of
a sudden I found out there were
5 extra-large instances in

476
01:12:52,750 --> 01:12:59,417
regions I don't use which is why
I didn't use them. California
and Ireland for those who care.

477
01:12:59,417 --> 01:13:05,417
I had racked up $500 in charge
in 3 days on my personal
account. So that sort of sucked.

478
01:13:08,292 --> 01:13:15,125
So I turned in all of the
instances and at the last
minute, by the way, this is the

479
01:13:15,125 --> 01:13:19,875
first time I have talked about a
fail on the fail panel which is
kind of cool. So I terminated

480
01:13:19,875 --> 01:13:25,875
the instances and I hit snap
chat just in time. And I was
like, what the fuck happened? I

481
01:13:34,333 --> 01:13:41,000
know I published on get help.
I'm not an idiot, I put them in
configuration file. I'm a

482
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:47,000
hacker. And I use a black
background with gray text. When
you comment [indiscernible] and

483
01:13:55,292 --> 01:14:01,292
I just missed it and publish my
route keys up on to get help.
Wa, wa, wa, wa. Oops. Really

484
01:14:08,167 --> 01:14:15,458
need to learn how to leave. So I
keep running through my
incidence response process and I

485
01:14:15,458 --> 01:14:19,542
actually go ahead, take the
snapshot, you can keep that as
additional storage volume and

486
01:14:19,542 --> 01:14:25,542
start looking at it. It took
about 3 seconds to find Kuda
Minoor. Anybody know what that

487
01:14:30,083 --> 01:14:36,083
was? White coin. They had logged
5 really big instances and found
the IP addresses, there was one

488
01:14:39,250 --> 01:14:44,000
in China and other places. So I
had both the ATP and Russians
after me. It was pretty

489
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:50,000
interesting. I've uploaded my
credentials, waited for 36
hours, the bad guys found it and

490
01:14:59,250 --> 01:15:06,500
Amazon actually found it because
so many people actually make
this God damned fucking mistake

491
01:15:06,500 --> 01:15:12,500
and they can find all the idiot
it's like me. I think they have
now gone into, I found out, they

492
01:15:18,917 --> 01:15:24,417
don't talk about that the Google
Play Store because they have
their credentials in the app

493
01:15:24,417 --> 01:15:30,417
store. They notify the owners of
the credentials. That's not much
of a sale though, but it's

494
01:15:37,167 --> 01:15:43,000
pretty fucking cool. It took me
about 45 minutes for my
incidence response to run

495
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:48,417
through that entire thing. I did
alerts, I did my route it now,
posted my credentials on line

496
01:15:48,417 --> 01:15:54,417
because I'm an idiot and human.
I got in there right away, I
didn't screw around with it, I

497
01:15:59,208 --> 01:16:03,000
knew it was a test account, so I
didn't have anything on it. And
the best part, I blogged about

498
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:09,000
it. You know what's really cool
about having a blog? You get
things from Amazon saying, hey,

499
01:16:12,417 --> 01:16:18,417
we read your blog post, we're
reversing the charges.  >>
[Applause].  >> And so I posted

500
01:16:26,500 --> 01:16:33,083
it and then I realized I got a
lot of comments. So I just got
hit, pushed me keys to get up

501
01:16:33,083 --> 01:16:39,083
stupidly, ignoring Amazon's
mail, I have a $4,162, we got
over $19,000 racked up during 30

502
01:16:46,167 --> 01:16:52,792
hours until they read their
e-mail. The lab got hit with big
money and that was posted after

503
01:16:52,792 --> 01:17:00,250
the $19,000 e-mail. So this is
actually sort of a real thing.
And the Wall Street Journal

504
01:17:00,250 --> 01:17:05,833
reporter called me and said can
you tell me who your commenters
are, I want to do a bid on this.

505
01:17:05,833 --> 01:17:11,833
Amazon is doing stuff to protect
their users. And then a whole
another presentation piece they

506
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:27,458
didn't want to know about. So,
you know, I realized I needed to
have a better Internet response

507
01:17:27,458 --> 01:17:34,792
through all of this stuff. As
part of that, I built a tool,
just a little concept thing, I

508
01:17:34,792 --> 01:17:40,792
call it Security Squirrel. And
what this tool does, if you have
a compromised account, it will

509
01:17:46,708 --> 01:17:51,667
do all of the forensic stuff for
you. So if you have to do
incidence response for a

510
01:17:51,667 --> 01:17:57,667
compromised service. How long
does it take? Hours? Days?
Hours? Days? Okay, let's see how

511
01:18:03,250 --> 01:18:08,292
long this takes? And I'm
tethered to my iPad, so we'll
see how this works. It's not a

512
01:18:08,292 --> 01:18:15,375
vibrator, so it will likely
work.  >> Ha, ha, ha!  >>
There's an incidence I put

513
01:18:15,375 --> 01:18:21,375
earlier. Sorry, it's done. So
what I just did is -- it's too
fast. I took the meta data, all

514
01:18:31,750 --> 01:18:37,750
the operating system, all the
details Amazon has and I moved
it and it cuts off all in-bound

515
01:18:40,125 --> 01:18:46,125
and out-bound traffic. No
administrators can see that
instance any more. The only

516
01:18:50,958 --> 01:18:55,375
people who can see that in
Amazon are the security team.
Completely cut off from the

517
01:18:55,375 --> 01:18:59,542
network and the world. It
actually disappeared from their
AWS screen. I enumerated it. I

518
01:18:59,542 --> 01:19:04,750
attached the snapshots as
external storage volumes so I
can do my forensic analysis on

519
01:19:04,750 --> 01:19:10,750
it and it took like, what, 8
seconds -- no, 3, 4, 5, seconds.
In the end, I learned my lesson.

520
01:19:24,917 --> 01:19:32,042
The best part was a different
cloud provider read my blog post
and hired me to come to their

521
01:19:32,042 --> 01:19:36,542
research and development
conference to present this
material and talk with their

522
01:19:36,542 --> 01:19:42,708
teams about how to protect their
customers and got kind of --
let's just say thousands of

523
01:19:42,708 --> 01:19:48,708
dollars to do that, which is
kind of what I do. So I have a
new business model. Fuck up!  >>

524
01:19:53,750 --> 01:19:59,750
[Laughter].  >> Blog about it,
profit!  >> [Applause].  >> So
if there are any investors this

525
01:20:09,167 --> 01:20:15,167
the audience, I will be listing
myself on the exchange soon.  >>
You really take failed to a

526
01:20:18,208 --> 01:20:24,750
whole new extreme.  >> Fail
fast, fail often.  >> All right,
so I have another minor request.

527
01:20:24,750 --> 01:20:31,375
We've been doing this fail panel
for 7 years. This is the -- or
this is the 7th year.  >> This

528
01:20:31,375 --> 01:20:38,042
is the 7th year, hour 13 and 14
not-for-profit.  >> It's quite
likely the last one. Never say

529
01:20:38,042 --> 01:20:45,625
never, so I'm not going to say
never. My 5-year-old daughter
has this weird obsession that

530
01:20:45,625 --> 01:20:50,208
she thinks it's important to be
famous and she asked me if I was
famous. And I said I'm Internet

531
01:20:50,208 --> 01:20:56,208
famous, but not in a bad way, no
porn.  >> [Off mic].  >>
[Laughter].  >> Yeah, so I was

532
01:20:56,208 --> 01:21:02,167
going to try to FaceTime here.
If you don't want to be on
camera, turn your face. Everyone

533
01:21:02,167 --> 01:21:05,208
needs to say hi, Riley and hi,
Erin. I have a son, too, but he
could give a fuck. Everybody

534
01:21:05,208 --> 01:21:11,208
ready?  >> Hi, Riley! Hi, Erin!
 >> Thank you everyone. It's
been great doing this, we might

535
01:21:42,875 --> 01:21:50,583
be back, but we've done
everything from robots to Wi-Fi
hacking, you know it. And on

536
01:21:50,583 --> 01:21:56,583
that note, let me load this up,
we're going to go to Rob Graham.
We have 30 minutes left, the

537
01:21:59,125 --> 01:22:05,125
donations. Feel free to continue
donating even though the
doughnuts are gone. The bids on

538
01:22:10,583 --> 01:22:17,875
the uber waffle is $100 and the
Vegas waffle is 69, from some
smart ass, but we like you

539
01:22:17,875 --> 01:22:24,500
anyway.  >> I'm sitting here
trying to figure out how to
explain to my daughters what we

540
01:22:24,500 --> 01:22:28,167
do for a living.  >> We have
doughnut boxes. We will
autograph the empty doughnut

541
01:22:28,167 --> 01:22:34,167
boxes.  >> Any doughnuts left?
 >> We are long out of
doughnuts.  >> I have two nieces

542
01:22:50,208 --> 01:22:56,208
that live in Japan and their
impression of Uncle Rob is this
clown who arrives once or twice

543
01:22:58,458 --> 01:23:05,917
a year and they can play with.
 >> [Laughter].  >> So they're
names are Miya and Mari, so if

544
01:23:05,917 --> 01:23:11,917
you could do the same thing you
did for rich and say, hi, Maya,
hi, Mari, that would be awesome.

545
01:23:23,708 --> 01:23:29,708
 >> Oh, we can totally do that.
 >> Go!  >> Hi, Miya! Hi, Mari!
 >> That's awesome!  >> Wait a

546
01:23:34,375 --> 01:23:40,375
minute, you are all doing what
you're told? Everybody, bid on
the fucking waffles already!  >>

547
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:54,000
Yeah  >> So I thought I would
cover something that is actually
pretty lame and that is how the

548
01:23:56,208 --> 01:24:02,208
news people report about cyber
security. After the heart bleed
virus spread throughout the

549
01:24:04,917 --> 01:24:10,917
Internet, you thought maybe we
should stand up and say, hey,
wait a minute, there's actually

550
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:22,750
a problem with the way you
report it on news. And I thought
by now the kids graduating from

551
01:24:22,750 --> 01:24:28,750
college would have done this,
but they know how to use the
iPad but no idea how technology

552
01:24:36,375 --> 01:24:42,375
works. I have a friend who is
kindergarten teacher, and for
the poor kids, it's fine. But

553
01:24:45,917 --> 01:24:52,750
the middle class kids can't hold
a Crayon because they are on
iPads all the time. They need

554
01:24:52,750 --> 01:24:58,750
remedial teaching on how to
actually draw something. And I
think that's where the news is

555
01:25:05,792 --> 01:25:11,792
going is that route. There was a
story about the inventor of zip
coin and as it turns out, that

556
01:25:19,500 --> 01:25:26,417
story was based upon nothing
concrete. And I was looking at
the story and realized all the

557
01:25:26,417 --> 01:25:33,958
things the reported quoted as
things that prove that this guy
was the guy from zip coin, who

558
01:25:33,958 --> 01:25:41,667
was worth probably a billion
dollars, half of them applied to
me. And I was like down on the

559
01:25:41,667 --> 01:25:48,167
list of like 10,000 most likely
[indiscernible] Moto. So I was
going through the list and

560
01:25:48,167 --> 01:25:54,167
looking at my fellow fail
panelists and thinking.  >> [Off
mic].  >> [Laughter].  >> And

561
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:16,000
thinking that, all of these
weird things about their life
suddenly make sense. Like I was

562
01:26:21,167 --> 01:26:27,125
mentioning my Japanese nieces I
get to see a couple times a
year. That means I have this

563
01:26:27,125 --> 01:26:33,250
weird connection with none of
the rest of you guys, it is
unique to me, I have this weird

564
01:26:33,250 --> 01:26:39,250
association with Japan that
would lead me to use that as my
handle. Dave Maynard, one of his

565
01:26:44,458 --> 01:26:50,458
grandparents is Japanese so
maybe that's how he's connected
to Moto. The Emperor's wife

566
01:26:55,417 --> 01:27:01,417
claimed his penis was made in
Japan, so he has this weird tie
to Japan that the rest of us

567
01:27:08,333 --> 01:27:14,333
have.  >> Hang on a second, mine
is not remotable.  >> I have to
read this from the slides

568
01:27:26,833 --> 01:27:32,833
because I can't, you know, it's
meaningless, you wrote a
deconstruction of Japanese

569
01:27:38,542 --> 01:27:44,542
literature. Who else has written
a deconstruction like this? So
Rich is like Moto. And

570
01:27:54,750 --> 01:28:00,750
[indiscernible] couldn't be here
because he picked a fight with a
UFC fighter last night.  >> [Off

571
01:28:03,250 --> 01:28:09,250
mic].  >> Or that. My story is
better. He does jujitsu and
martial arts and has that

572
01:28:15,625 --> 01:28:21,625
connection to Moto. Wendy is
[indiscernible] and so maybe she
is connected to Moto. So my

573
01:28:33,250 --> 01:28:39,250
point is, is the way these news
stories are constructed is --.
 >> It took you that long to

574
01:28:42,042 --> 01:28:48,042
pars that?  >> [Laughter].  >>
[Off mic].  >> They pick a news
story and then go hunting for

575
01:28:52,292 --> 01:28:56,875
evidence to support it. So there
was [indiscernible] in Russia
this year, in [indiscernible]

576
01:28:56,875 --> 01:29:02,875
Russia, NBC did a story where it
starts out with, I don't know, a
good looking guy saying stuff on

577
01:29:09,542 --> 01:29:17,542
TV and he said if they fire up
their phones at baggage claims
it's probably too late because

578
01:29:17,542 --> 01:29:23,167
the Russian hackers have already
hacked you. So I looked into
that. I took my little ninja

579
01:29:23,167 --> 01:29:30,542
phone that I got two years ago
at ninja party and I installed
an app that said fake GPS and I

580
01:29:30,542 --> 01:29:33,875
tried to replicate what the
story reported. So I set my GPS
location to Russia and installed

581
01:29:33,875 --> 01:29:39,875
a VPN so it was going through
Russia. So if there was some
evil hacker, they would be

582
01:29:52,750 --> 01:29:58,750
intercepting my traffic. I then
did what they talked about,
which was to search the

583
01:30:02,833 --> 01:30:08,833
Internet. And so I had to go
through all my security settings
and set things like, allow

584
01:30:11,333 --> 01:30:17,333
installation of market apps,
where it can go to any other
Internet and install an Android

585
01:30:20,500 --> 01:30:28,292
app. It gave me lots of warnings
saying, do you really want to do
this and I said yes. Now I had

586
01:30:28,292 --> 01:30:34,958
the problem, the news story was
really about how some websites
might give you an Android app. I

587
01:30:34,958 --> 01:30:40,958
couldn't find any Android app.
So I had to look for things like
update.APK looking for a hostile

588
01:30:45,833 --> 01:30:51,833
Android app. And then actually,
there's a lot a hacker would
have to go through to install an

589
01:30:58,708 --> 01:31:05,000
Android app. You have to hunt
things down and go through
options April here is the APK I

590
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:11,000
want to install.  >> Do, do, do,
do, do, do.  >> I'm getting
excited just sitting here.  >>

591
01:31:15,792 --> 01:31:23,333
So maybe the reporter doesn't
have it go through all this
struggle here, but it gave

592
01:31:23,333 --> 01:31:28,500
warning after warning like
saying installing this app may
harm your device. Do you really

593
01:31:28,500 --> 01:31:32,417
want to install this
application? It makes phone
calls on your behalf and goes

594
01:31:32,417 --> 01:31:39,250
through all your contacts. And
what the story was on NBC's
program was, and here's how they

595
01:31:39,250 --> 01:31:45,250
lead to it, was Melissa hijacked
our phone before I even started
my coffee. After he had gone

596
01:31:48,167 --> 01:31:54,958
through all of those steps. So
when I saw this story, I
thought, well, yeah, Russian

597
01:31:54,958 --> 01:32:00,958
hackers could be like having a
cell phone baseband intercepting
the Internet traffic. No, it was

598
01:32:06,750 --> 01:32:13,708
going through all of these steps
one after the other, configuring
his phone saying, yes, I want to

599
01:32:13,708 --> 01:32:19,708
install this malware on my
phone. Even after those steps,
yeah, I was hacked.  >> This is

600
01:32:23,083 --> 01:32:29,083
the part where Rich's pants come
off, by the way. Pants, pants,
pant!  >> [Off mic].  >> Yeah!

601
01:32:32,583 --> 01:32:37,292
[Cheering].  >> I want money,
cash.  >> We need more
donations. He only drops for

602
01:32:37,292 --> 01:32:41,417
cash.  >> Come on 20 bucks, 20
bucks, 20 bucks. I see 20 bucks.
 >> [Off mic].  >> [Laughter].

603
01:32:41,417 --> 01:32:47,417
 >> Come on, we need some more
catch, come on!  >> I need some
more money!  >> More catch!  >>

604
01:32:52,500 --> 01:32:58,500
We have a message here from Mr.
Rothman.  >> So, Rich, you
understand that we're a

605
01:33:00,875 --> 01:33:07,667
professional company and we
can't have you taking your pants
off all the time Rich, it's not

606
01:33:07,667 --> 01:33:13,667
acceptable.  >> That's a good
impersonation of Rothman.  >>
120? 140?  >> [Applause].  >> 7

607
01:33:23,500 --> 01:33:29,500
years in a row!  >> [Applause].
 >> I will pay $100 to anyone
who takes that picture.  >> And

608
01:33:35,542 --> 01:33:40,583
now all of DEF CON knows I'm a
natural red head!  >> Rich, we
have in fact, seen the

609
01:33:40,583 --> 01:33:46,583
Travelocity Nome.  >> So there's
this outcry about NBC and
Newsweek and they said, no,

610
01:33:53,542 --> 01:34:00,750
we've investigated these things
and these are the highest levels
of journalistic excellence,

611
01:34:00,750 --> 01:34:05,792
blah, blah, blah. So there was a
story about Jacob Asbomb during
Christmas where he talks about

612
01:34:05,792 --> 01:34:10,833
the amp catalog, it's all
various evil devices the NSA
has. And one of them listens in

613
01:34:10,833 --> 01:34:16,500
on people, they get a response
from the audio. And he went off
on this whole thing about, oh,

614
01:34:16,500 --> 01:34:20,625
it causes cancer because it's at
1 kilowatt and for example, he
was saying it was an evil

615
01:34:20,625 --> 01:34:23,667
cancerous device. And that's the
stuff on the news, they all
report it on, they say hey,

616
01:34:23,667 --> 01:34:27,125
Chavez may have been killed by
the NSA 1 kilowatt. It does not
cause cancer, it may burn you,

617
01:34:27,125 --> 01:34:30,708
but it's not going to cause
cancer. So I said, why don't you
talk to people like at DEF CON

618
01:34:30,708 --> 01:34:33,625
because everything --.  >> Hey,
Rob, is your presentation
causing cancer right now?  >>

619
01:34:33,625 --> 01:34:37,167
[Laughter].  >> So for
everything in the amp catalog
and every evil thing the NSA

620
01:34:37,167 --> 01:34:44,125
does, there's someone is here at
DEF CON who has presented on or
can present on it. And his

621
01:34:44,125 --> 01:34:50,125
response was typically, like
blah, blah, blah, I must have
missed it. It was actually kind

622
01:34:54,500 --> 01:35:00,500
of cool because last year at DEF
CON they had a short story
contest and I had written a

623
01:35:05,500 --> 01:35:10,458
story where that was actually
the plot. I had not actually
presented it, but I did a story

624
01:35:10,458 --> 01:35:15,167
about the guy who presented it
and it was all cool. So this
year at DEF CON, Michael --.  >>

625
01:35:15,167 --> 01:35:19,833
Wait, doesn't this just prove
you work for the NSA?  >> Yes, I
work for the NSA.  >> You heard

626
01:35:19,833 --> 01:35:24,333
it here first, folks.  >> You
know, I hack the NSA. So Michael
is the expert, I'm not the

627
01:35:24,333 --> 01:35:28,792
expert, he is the expert on such
a thing. He is presenting on
using what you see. In the

628
01:35:28,792 --> 01:35:33,458
picture here is a Hasbro for the
little race car things and you
use a radar gun to measure the

629
01:35:33,458 --> 01:35:38,167
speed. And it's the same kind of
radar gun the police use to
catch you on the road. And it

630
01:35:38,167 --> 01:35:42,625
produces a constant radar signal
and it can be used to pull back
audio and stuff. So that's an

631
01:35:42,625 --> 01:35:47,375
example of, for everything the
NSA does, instead of like
quoting some activist out there

632
01:35:47,375 --> 01:35:50,917
who may know something about
cyber security, there's actually
a thousand people here who have

633
01:35:50,917 --> 01:35:54,708
probably demoed that at DEF CON.
 >> [Laughter].  >> The worst
example of this is Bruce

634
01:35:54,708 --> 01:35:59,000
Schneider and he is a smart guy,
really creative, has insightful
things to say and he knows a

635
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:03,500
lot, but the press treats him as
this prophet.  >> He will watch
this blog post saying, I wonder

636
01:36:03,500 --> 01:36:07,750
what I'm going to have for lunch
today. And the story will come
out saying Bruce Schneider says

637
01:36:07,750 --> 01:36:12,500
the NSA kills puppies. And I
asked why they do this and they
said it's the only guy they have

638
01:36:12,500 --> 01:36:16,500
heard of. So they pull it apart
to support whatever weird thing
they are claiming. So the

639
01:36:16,500 --> 01:36:19,833
Congressman who took that quote
and said Bruce Schneider has
noted, confirmed that

640
01:36:19,833 --> 01:36:22,667
[indiscernible] is selling
[indiscernible]. But, again,
what he said was, I don't know.

641
01:36:22,667 --> 01:36:26,708
Maybe that's a possibility. He
didn't say he confirmed, he just
said, well, I don't know. So

642
01:36:26,708 --> 01:36:30,958
there was a quote about --
again, Bruce Schneider on top of
Bruce Lee here. It was an

643
01:36:30,958 --> 01:36:34,500
activist, the NSA wasn't
involved and that becomes --.
 >> Oh!  >> Premature!  >> Well,

644
01:36:34,500 --> 01:36:38,542
that becomes a confirmation that
experts have wondered --.  >>
I'm going to let you continue in

645
01:36:38,542 --> 01:36:42,792
a minute.  >> Why are you so bad
at computers?  >> [Laughter].
 >> Okay, gang! I have been

646
01:36:42,792 --> 01:36:47,542
given the 10 minute warning. The
uber waffle is up to $150. Are
you going to take that? $175 for

647
01:36:47,542 --> 01:36:52,250
the Vegas waffle.  >> Thank you!
 >> 100 bucks!  >> 100 bucks and
keep it?  >> Thank you.  >> We

648
01:36:52,250 --> 01:36:57,000
thank you.  >> [Off mic].  >> So
if I knew how to use PowerPoint
you would see the quote here,

649
01:36:57,000 --> 01:37:00,333
which is experts wonder whether
vulnerability was deliberately
started by the NSA. So it

650
01:37:00,333 --> 01:37:04,583
started by -- you can say
anything, like, this morning, I
got up and took a dump and

651
01:37:04,583 --> 01:37:08,583
suddenly that becomes something
quoted in the news. So that's my
thought. Okay, excellent.  >>

652
01:37:08,583 --> 01:37:14,583
[Applause].  >> Dave needs a
dongle. Dave needs a dongle.  >>
I know where to put the dongle.

653
01:37:35,958 --> 01:37:41,958
I put the dongle lots of places.
I did, I put a dongle in the
spot, I put a dongle in a spot

654
01:40:30,208 --> 01:40:36,208
more than once.  >> [Off mic]
 >> I never use protection --
no, wait, I always use

655
01:41:19,958 --> 01:41:25,958
protection. I do. Is protection
why I have a roll of nickels in
my pocket?  >> [Off mic].  >>

656
01:41:28,375 --> 01:41:35,500
Oh, yes. It's my dongle.  >> I'm
into that.  >> [Off mic].  >>
It's in upside down and

657
01:41:35,500 --> 01:41:42,167
apparently it still works.  >>
So we can't fail again.  >>
Again. Again.  >> Because we

658
01:41:42,167 --> 01:41:50,167
keep failing, so for the last
two years I've been playing with
Dustin on [indiscernible] and

659
01:41:50,167 --> 01:41:57,583
after a joke turned into Hanson
actually releasing a new album,
I came to realize, this is not a

660
01:41:57,583 --> 01:42:03,333
joke. We should not play around
with forces beyond our control.
Hence, they might release a

661
01:42:03,333 --> 01:42:08,958
second album. I can't be
responsibility for that. I have
enough people who hate me over

662
01:42:08,958 --> 01:42:16,458
the original album. So Rob and I
came up with something
different. We scanned the

663
01:42:16,458 --> 01:42:23,375
Internet a bunch. Rob wrote a
high speed tool, it's called
NASCAN. If you want to scan the

664
01:42:23,375 --> 01:42:29,833
Internet, do it right now, do it
from DEF CON.  >> So nothing
shows how badly broke defenders

665
01:42:29,833 --> 01:42:30,833
are.  

666
01:42:30,833 --> 01:42:35,208
>>> Hold on, I'm getting a call.
It's from Madam O. You know,
what, it just keeps going. It's

667
01:42:35,208 --> 01:42:41,667
got stamina. Oh, wow. Nothing
shows how badly these two are
broken as people scanning

668
01:42:41,667 --> 01:42:47,667
jail.0.0.0. If you have ever
used a map, you have dreamed of
scanning the Internet. You can

669
01:43:14,208 --> 01:43:22,000
type in that address. So in a
year, we have 145 complaints for
scanning the Internet. The

670
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:27,375
majority of those were
particularly from
[indiscernible] Hartly. So the

671
01:43:27,375 --> 01:43:34,458
average response time -- between
us scanning them and somebody
complaining about it is 24

672
01:43:34,458 --> 01:43:41,458
hours.  >> So what we do by the
way --.  >> Dude, that's way too
much technical detail. That's

673
01:43:41,458 --> 01:43:47,583
way too much information.  >>
I'm going to do it anyway. It's
important.  >> We're getting

674
01:43:47,583 --> 01:43:52,250
this up and ready.  >> But we
get all of our abuse complaints
back, so we get all the emails

675
01:43:52,250 --> 01:43:58,250
of people saying stuff.  >> So
-- no, no.  >> [Laughter].  >>
So the point is that we started

676
01:44:00,750 --> 01:44:06,750
getting emails like this,
honestly, some people in the
audience will send us an e-mail

677
01:44:09,458 --> 01:44:20,038
like this, they would want us to
fuck off and die.  >> Dave, it's
for your butt.  >> Right.  >> My

678
01:44:20,042 --> 01:44:30,417
favorite one is the facility in
Korea who CC'd an e-mail for
everybody in the security. So we

679
01:44:30,417 --> 01:44:42,792
were able to get an entire list
just from them reporting. And
you may ask yourself, what type

680
01:44:42,792 --> 01:44:55,072
of egregious activity would cause
you to copy everyone in your
security? They outed themselves

681
01:44:55,083 --> 01:45:05,983
for somebody doing HTTP
security. Even Rich couldn't
make money off that business

682
01:45:05,983 --> 01:45:07,983
model >> [Laughter] >>

683
01:45:14,740 --> 01:45:20,740
My favorite thing though,
MMSP. We would request all of
the e-mails your clients have

684
01:45:20,750 --> 01:45:30,208
been sending for a year. I had
to remove the company's name for
privacy, but they sent us the

685
01:45:30,208 --> 01:45:40,875
same thing, the MMRST company
name, they abbreviated and they
put it in the username and then

686
01:45:40,875 --> 01:45:45,917
the source address for the
e-mail is the company name. So
for instance if we had a company

687
01:45:45,917 --> 01:45:51,917
called the failpanel.com, it
would be at the failpanel.com.
They said these 400 clients have

688
01:45:58,240 --> 01:46:06,417
when we asked them what blocks
they'd like us to exclude from the
scanning they said we cant tell you.

689
01:46:06,417 --> 01:46:14,617
But they all sent us e-mails so this is
your client list. When have
gotten congratulations letters

690
01:46:14,625 --> 01:46:23,500
when they sign up a new client.
That's how well we know their
clients. >> [Applause]. >> And

691
01:46:23,500 --> 01:46:31,500
on that note, ladies and
gentlemen, please don't do that.
Thank you. >> [Applause]. >>

692
01:46:37,400 --> 01:46:42,120
We get a lot of messages that
say is, please stop scanning us,
they wouldn't tell us who they

693
01:46:42,125 --> 01:46:49,542
are or what their IP address is.
And it's pretty funny because
they don't get the fact that we

694
01:46:49,542 --> 01:46:54,750
don't know who they are. We're
scanning the entire Internet, we
don't know who you are. So

695
01:46:54,750 --> 01:47:01,500
there's a company -- I'm on a
podcast and I launch a scan the
night before. >> You know that

696
01:47:01,500 --> 01:47:10,040
we're done, right?  >> And --.
>> No, no. >> We're getting
dossed here. >> I want to thank

697
01:47:10,042 --> 01:47:17,292
everyone for coming, you all
donated $685 in cash for
doughnuts and Rich to drop his

698
01:47:17,292 --> 01:47:31,572
pants. And I congratulate Rue
for the Vegas waffle and come on
up and get the uber waffle.

699
01:47:31,580 --> 01:47:40,560
Thank you, everyone. >> Thank
you all! >> And the last thing
is, at the end we have patches

700
01:47:40,560 --> 01:47:49,875
for our speakers, so I'd like to
call everybody up. Mr. David
Mortman, Mr. Rob Graham. You get

701
01:47:49,875 --> 01:47:55,375
a DEF CON speaker patch. James
Arlin. Wendy Nebor. Get over
here, David Mortman.  >>
