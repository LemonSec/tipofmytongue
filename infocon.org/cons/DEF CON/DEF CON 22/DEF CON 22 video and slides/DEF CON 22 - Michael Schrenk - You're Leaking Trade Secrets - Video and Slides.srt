1
00:00:00,083 --> 00:00:07,875
>> So, as a speaker, it's very
difficult to come to DEF CON and
watch really terrific talks and

2
00:00:07,875 --> 00:00:14,375
not develop some sense of
speaker envy, you know. So this
is a very humbling thing to do,

3
00:00:14,375 --> 00:00:21,458
and even though this is my 6th 
year doing this, it's nothing I
take lightly, and it's a great

4
00:00:21,458 --> 00:00:27,333
honor to be with you guys doing
this, so I'd just like to thank
the goons that do speaker opps

5
00:00:27,333 --> 00:00:34,917
for make a really great
experience as a speaker. Every
year at DEF CON, something new

6
00:00:34,917 --> 00:00:42,625
happens and I had a new
experience this year. I want to
thank the people at black hat,

7
00:00:42,625 --> 00:00:48,625
as well. I decided to come to
the Rio on Thursday to pick up
my credentials and went home, I

8
00:00:52,667 --> 00:00:59,083
live here in Vegas and I very
innocently took out my materials
and I sat down my black hat

9
00:00:59,083 --> 00:01:06,083
badge on my dining room table
and put my DEF CON bag next to
it and I looked at it and I go

10
00:01:06,083 --> 00:01:13,000
this is really interesting and I
did a tweet, you know, the
difference between black hat and

11
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,375
DEF CON in one picture and I
this that was amusing, I didn't
think it was bad amusing. Well,

12
00:01:17,375 --> 00:01:23,375
between re‑ tweets and favorites
and whatnot, this got reposted
like 700 times on Twitter, so my

13
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:34,583
phone was doing this for almost
the entire Con, it was like warm
‑ ‑ that was a cool experience,

14
00:01:34,583 --> 00:01:40,583
a very cool experience. So my
name is Michael Schrank, I have
a book, I will be doing a book

15
00:01:42,958 --> 00:01:50,417
signing, if you have questions,
we can book up, I don't tell
people I write bot nets and bots

16
00:01:50,417 --> 00:01:56,417
any more, I didn't tell people I
do that any more because I'm ear
met with blank stares or looks

17
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:08,458
of horror, so now I just tell
people I do business
intelligence, and that seems to

18
00:02:08,458 --> 00:02:14,458
have a better story for people.
I've been doing DEF CON since
97, DEF CON 5 was my first one

19
00:02:20,542 --> 00:02:25,292
and I came out here to cover it
for a computer world magazine,
it was the first article that

20
00:02:25,292 --> 00:02:32,250
I've ever had published and I
started thinking this weekend
about the effect DEF CON has had

21
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:37,292
on my life, if I hadn't come out
here for that, I would have
never been published, I would

22
00:02:37,292 --> 00:02:41,625
have never got a book deal, all
of the things that came after
the book, all the foreign

23
00:02:41,625 --> 00:02:46,625
travel, the speaking
opportunities, the gigs I
probably didn't deserve, if DEF

24
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:54,083
CON hadn't made me come out to
Vegas once a year for 17 years I
probably never would have moved

25
00:02:54,083 --> 00:03:00,542
here, you know, so it's an
awesome thing, a very awesome
thing. So today, what I'm going

26
00:03:00,542 --> 00:03:06,083
to talk about, the name of the
talk is your leaking trade
secrets, but what I'm really

27
00:03:06,083 --> 00:03:12,583
talking about is organization of
privacy, and it's a little bit
different than personal privacy,

28
00:03:12,583 --> 00:03:20,500
because individuals tend to leak
identity issues whereas
organizations tend to leak trade

29
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:26,500
secrets. So the message I want
you to have coming out of here
is information that you put

30
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:34,500
online, on the web, is not
always read by the intended
audience and it's not always

31
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:40,500
used the way it's intended to be
used now, there's been a lot of
awareness about personal privacy

32
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:48,417
but there's been much less
awareness about organizational
privacy and I think that's

33
00:03:48,417 --> 00:03:53,333
largely because of the way the
media handles it. The media's
been roll good at informing

34
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:59,000
people about things but less
good about informing our
organizations, and I think a

35
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:05,458
lost that is the types of
stories they cover. So in the
case of leaked trade secrets,

36
00:04:05,458 --> 00:04:08,208
these kinds of stories are
always treated as news stories,
they're factual, but they don't

37
00:04:08,208 --> 00:04:15,583
really teach any lessons.
Whereas, you know, there are
other reasons I think for the

38
00:04:15,583 --> 00:04:21,583
press covering personal privacy
issues. For example, the one
thing, it creates a lot of

39
00:04:23,708 --> 00:04:28,292
customers for a lot of
advertisers so it makes good
business sense to do that kind

40
00:04:28,292 --> 00:04:35,958
of thing. The other thing is it
is just really good content. One
of my favorite stories about a

41
00:04:35,958 --> 00:04:42,917
personal leak, about a year ago,
that there was a head master at
a Privilege School, I believe

42
00:04:42,917 --> 00:04:50,875
it's in Georgia, who was let go.
And he felt he was let go for
the wrong reason, he felt it was

43
00:04:50,875 --> 00:04:56,875
age discrimination, so he filed
a suit, they settled out of
court, stipulation that he never

44
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:05,500
talked about 9 case about what
does his daughter do she gets on
Facebook, she lets her know that

45
00:05:12,042 --> 00:05:18,042
the case was settled and they
were paying for her trip to
Europe. The other story like is

46
00:05:22,417 --> 00:05:28,417
if you're a soldier and you're
stationed someplace where your
government says you're not, you

47
00:05:30,917 --> 00:05:38,542
can probably removed the GEO
codes off your selfie before you
upload it to Instagram, I love

48
00:05:38,542 --> 00:05:45,458
that one, but these are great
because they teach lessons. And
the lesson that this should be

49
00:05:45,458 --> 00:05:52,500
teaching all of us is that there
is not a piece of software,
there's not a piece of hardware

50
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:58,750
that can protect against this
kind of stuff. It's an awareness
thing, and there's really no

51
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:04,000
substitute for awareness. So one
of the things I'm going to do is
we're talking about trade

52
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:10,000
secret, I've got examples of
unintentional data leaks and
this is really all about

53
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:19,542
business intelligence, because
if it wasn't somebody doing
things with these leaks, they

54
00:06:19,542 --> 00:06:23,708
really wouldn't matter, right,
so we're going to look at little
bit about how online

55
00:06:23,708 --> 00:06:28,000
intelligence is different than
offline intelligence. But then
finally, we're going to talk a

56
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,000
little bit about what can be
done to minimize the effects of
all of this kind of stuff. So

57
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:38,333
what is the trade secret? Trade
secrets are intellectual
property but they're very

58
00:06:38,333 --> 00:06:43,708
different than patents and very
different than copyrights. The
biggest difference is that you

59
00:06:43,708 --> 00:06:50,500
don't need to publish a trade
secret, and if you did publish
one, it would not be a trade

60
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:55,958
secret any more, so that's
obvious. Unlike patents and
copyrights, they have absolutely

61
00:06:55,958 --> 00:07:02,000
no expiration date and they're
protected by something called
the UTSA, and this came about, I

62
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:08,000
believe '70s or '80s unlike
patents or copyrights, there
were no laws. All but one or two

63
00:07:17,917 --> 00:07:23,667
states have signed off on this,
but it used to be an issue
because if it were a big company

64
00:07:23,667 --> 00:07:31,000
and you had offices across the
country, you would subject to
the various trade secret laws in

65
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:36,833
those various states, so this
simplified things quite a bit.
In order to be a trade secret,

66
00:07:36,833 --> 00:07:42,917
it must have some kind of
economic value. The interesting
thing that I think about trade

67
00:07:42,917 --> 00:07:48,583
secrets is that you can use
anybody's trade secret if you
happen to discover it on your

68
00:07:48,583 --> 00:07:54,750
own. So if you find it on a
piece of paper on a sidewalk,
you can use it. If you find it

69
00:07:54,750 --> 00:08:00,750
in wiki leaks, you can use it.
If you discover it through
reverse engineering, you can use

70
00:08:05,083 --> 00:08:10,500
it. If you discover it. So what
is the value of a trade secret?
Well, basically  ‑ ‑ oh one

71
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:14,583
other thing I think I forgot to
mention is you have to make some
effort to protect it, that's the

72
00:08:14,583 --> 00:08:19,250
other thing, you can't just come
back retro actively and say
that's a strayed secret, that

73
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:25,083
doesn't work. The reason you
established trade secrets is so
you can sue people and recovery

74
00:08:25,083 --> 00:08:31,958
losses and damages and attorneys
fees and that kind of stuff. But
only if somebody misappropriates

75
00:08:31,958 --> 00:08:37,958
the trade secret. If you lose it
through your own stupidity, it's
our own fault. So when people

76
00:08:40,292 --> 00:08:46,292
think about trade secrets they
automatically think about things
like the recipe for Coca‑ Cola

77
00:08:46,292 --> 00:08:52,000
or the formula for a fragrance
like Chanel number 5. The
interesting things about

78
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:59,583
fragrances is you can't
copyright or patent a fragrance
but you can have a trade secret

79
00:08:59,583 --> 00:09:06,375
over the formula, so if you go
in Walgreens and find a knock
off, they're perfectly legal

80
00:09:06,375 --> 00:09:11,917
because you can't copyright or
patent a fragrance, but you can
trade secret the process or the

81
00:09:11,917 --> 00:09:17,917
recipe. A lot of times, trade
secrets are used in conjunction
with patents, so you might have

82
00:09:22,208 --> 00:09:27,875
some patent, but the way you
implement those patents is some
kind of a process that's

83
00:09:27,875 --> 00:09:33,875
protected by trade secrets. But
today, more often, trade secrets
take the form of data, and I

84
00:09:37,458 --> 00:09:41,875
just listed a few of these here,
you know, things like your list
of your employee, your list of

85
00:09:41,875 --> 00:09:48,208
your suppliers, customer lists,
funding sources, expansion plan,
marketing plans, new product

86
00:09:48,208 --> 00:09:54,542
planning, pricing strategy,
labor issues, how quickly things
move in and out of your

87
00:09:54,542 --> 00:10:01,875
inventory, how fast thing sell,
IT infrastructure change,
security information, this is

88
00:10:01,875 --> 00:10:07,042
all data and these are all
straight secrets and in your
organization, you should treat

89
00:10:07,042 --> 00:10:13,042
these as secrets. And every try
is going to have a different
one. There's no  ‑ ‑ I mean,

90
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:19,542
depending on what you're doing
you're going to have different
things that you're going to call

91
00:10:19,542 --> 00:10:25,542
trade secrets. For example, in
the European Union, they have
much more progressive privacy

92
00:10:27,875 --> 00:10:35,000
laws than we have here in the
states, and in the EU, if
somebody is collecting personal

93
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:40,417
data, you have a right to go to
that organization and say what
is the data that you're

94
00:10:40,417 --> 00:10:46,667
collecting on me? And they have
to show it to you. Well,
somebody in I believe Ireland

95
00:10:46,667 --> 00:10:52,167
approached Facebook and says I
want all my data, I want to know
what you're collecting on me,

96
00:10:52,167 --> 00:10:59,792
Facebook used a little exemption
in the law that said if through
the disclosure you're going to

97
00:10:59,792 --> 00:11:07,417
show trade secret, you're exempt
from the law and Facebook said
hey, that's us, that's us. And

98
00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:12,292
these are all the trade secrets
that Facebook wanted to protect.
And I'm not putting these up

99
00:11:12,292 --> 00:11:17,333
here for you to read them, I'm
just showing you there were 22
of them, a lot of them and they

100
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:24,000
included things like, you know,
if you delete an image, we just
erase the pointer, it's still

101
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,500
really there. If you poke
somebody, we record that. You
know, all that kind of stuff.

102
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:35,833
And they were saying if you have
your data, you're essentially
learning about what we do with

103
00:11:35,833 --> 00:11:41,833
that data, since we buy the
nature of that data, so data has
become a trade secret. So we've

104
00:11:44,167 --> 00:11:48,333
got all of these potential trade
secrets now and they're all
floating around on the Internet

105
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:55,792
and this has really changed the
way business intelligence is
collected. For example, before

106
00:11:55,792 --> 00:12:03,208
1995, and I use 1995, because
for me, that's kind of when the
Internet [indiscernible] a

107
00:12:03,208 --> 00:12:09,792
little bit, before 1995, all the
web pages looked like
[indiscernible] web pages and

108
00:12:09,792 --> 00:12:16,542
things have just matured a
little bit there, so before 95,
you had to do things like this

109
00:12:16,542 --> 00:12:22,542
guy, this is Mitch Modell, the
CEO of Modell sporting goods and
he was accused of the following:

110
00:12:25,875 --> 00:12:32,792
He dressed up as a disguise,
misrepresented himself at dick's
sporting goods, told the

111
00:12:32,792 --> 00:12:38,792
receptionist that he was an
executive for Dick's and he was
waiting for a meetings with the

112
00:12:44,208 --> 00:12:51,333
CEO and she preceded to show him
room where there was a lot of
files and he started particular

113
00:12:51,333 --> 00:12:57,333
pictures and he was just helping
himself to information. What
makes this story really weird is

114
00:13:00,333 --> 00:13:07,125
that the same guy was also on
undercover boss on CBS where he
basically did the same thing

115
00:13:07,125 --> 00:13:13,375
except for his own employees so
he was really into this. But
this is the way intelligence was

116
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:21,000
often gathered prior to the
Internet. So before 1995, there
were limited number of sources,

117
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,708
you know, where are you going to
go? You can go look at the
patent files, you looked at

118
00:13:25,708 --> 00:13:32,500
newspaper, maybe subscribed
clipping service, it was manual,
it made it a really expensive

119
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:38,500
process, so it's not something
that you could do over and over
again. Basically, you would take

120
00:13:41,625 --> 00:13:47,458
a no shot of what was happening
at a certain time. It often
required physical contact, you

121
00:13:47,458 --> 00:13:52,583
know, maybe would go to a
conference and get your
competitor drunk and talk to him

122
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:59,125
and not tell him who you were,
you know. Probably we've all
done that. So it required

123
00:13:59,125 --> 00:14:05,333
physical contact and it often
required people to identify
themselves or if not identify

124
00:14:05,333 --> 00:14:11,333
themselves, occasionally get
caught. So you're anonymity
would be blown. Now after '95 

125
00:14:13,583 --> 00:14:19,083
there's almost an unlimited
number, I would sigh there is an
unlimited number of sources

126
00:14:19,083 --> 00:14:25,917
because they keep coming in and
out to automate data collection,
we can repeat it, do it day

127
00:14:25,917 --> 00:14:31,583
after day, you start looking at
data collected over time, and
you start to analyze trends and

128
00:14:31,583 --> 00:14:37,083
do all kinds of cool stuff. It
can be done remotely. And you
can usually  ‑ ‑ it can usually

129
00:14:37,083 --> 00:14:43,625
be done anonymously, so this
looks a lot like hacking, right?
You can do it remotely, automate

130
00:14:43,625 --> 00:14:49,458
it, you can do it anonymously,
so basically, business
intelligence has now become as

131
00:14:49,458 --> 00:14:56,708
far as I'm concerned, the other
thing about business
intelligence collected online is

132
00:14:56,708 --> 00:15:04,375
that it is immediately
actionable. And this evident in
my talk last year where I talked

133
00:15:04,375 --> 00:15:10,375
about a bot net that wrote about
$20  million worth of cars over
a period of 9 months, 20 

134
00:15:13,208 --> 00:15:19,208
million retail, I did it totally
by self. And this data that we
have basically, the inside

135
00:15:26,667 --> 00:15:33,375
information we had some inside
information on servers that
allowed the client to basically

136
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:39,375
buy things at will, and we were
able to act on that intelligence
immediately. So through the eyes

137
00:15:42,583 --> 00:15:49,875
of a hacker, anything you put
online is potential business
intelligence. And that's a

138
00:15:49,875 --> 00:15:55,875
really important point. Again,
every industry has its own
cases, I picked out a few that I

139
00:15:58,042 --> 00:16:04,042
think we can all relate to. All
right. So imagine the plight of
an online retailer, this is what

140
00:16:07,083 --> 00:16:13,542
they're thinking, I need to keep
my online store up to date and I
need to keep up with what's

141
00:16:13,542 --> 00:16:19,500
happening with competitors as
far as pricing, so I need to
respond to my market basically.

142
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:24,000
So a hacker looks at that and
says hey, I can watch the store
remotely, I can do it

143
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:30,667
anonymously and I can automate
the information gathering. So if
I monitor a retail site and you

144
00:16:30,667 --> 00:16:38,417
do it over time it's possible to
leak pricing strategies, you
start to figure things out, you

145
00:16:38,417 --> 00:16:43,083
can Figure out inventory
strategies, you have items
coming and going, I can't is

146
00:16:43,083 --> 00:16:49,083
that? Why is this no longer
offered? Sometimes they can show
supplier issues, right, if it's

147
00:16:51,125 --> 00:16:54,792
something you know that they
always have but they don't have
it now and they really should

148
00:16:54,792 --> 00:17:01,958
have it, they're having a
supplier issue. If they come off
and they are always having a

149
00:17:01,958 --> 00:17:07,958
lower price than you, they are
buying it from somebody
different or they have a better

150
00:17:10,833 --> 00:17:16,833
deal than you have. The problem
is much greater when you are a
retailer and selling specific

151
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:28,000
item, oh, so we're not talking
Sears now that has an infinite
number of T shirts we're talking

152
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:35,458
about a real estate website that
has one house on the corner of
3rd  and main, we're talking

153
00:17:35,458 --> 00:17:42,667
about  ‑ ‑ SE is a huge
business, in excess of a billed
a year. Emerchants tend to sell

154
00:17:42,667 --> 00:17:48,667
one item  at a time, you can
learn what is a good thing to
sell on eBay and watching what

155
00:17:52,375 --> 00:17:58,375
sells and for what price. Used
bookstores tend to sell single
copies of things, car

156
00:18:03,167 --> 00:18:08,458
dealerships, any kind of seller
of collectibles, and this group
includes anyone selling any kind

157
00:18:08,458 --> 00:18:14,458
of uniquely identifiable goods.
So if you watch one of these
stores over time, they basically

158
00:18:16,958 --> 00:18:23,583
disclose their entire service
record, right? You monitor this
long enough, you pretty much

159
00:18:23,583 --> 00:18:29,208
have enough information where
you can do their accounting. And
this is something that people

160
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:36,458
don't think about. Okay. Let's
look at  ‑ ‑ I love picking on
HR because I think they're

161
00:18:36,458 --> 00:18:42,833
probably the biggest source of
leaks within an organization. So
let's think about a HR manager,

162
00:18:42,833 --> 00:18:48,375
put yourself in their position.
They're thinking this year it's
going to be a busy year for us,

163
00:18:48,375 --> 00:18:55,083
we have a lot of stuff going on,
I need to post 250 job postings.
So that's what they're think,

164
00:18:55,083 --> 00:19:00,542
that's what their task is. The
hacker on the other hand thinks,
I can watch these job postings

165
00:19:00,542 --> 00:19:05,583
remotely, and they can be
anonymous while I'm doing it, I
can even look like somebody

166
00:19:05,583 --> 00:19:10,292
else, I could look like an
actual job seeker if I wanted to
and I can automate the

167
00:19:10,292 --> 00:19:17,167
information gathering. So what
does this do? Let's just look at
a simple job listing here, this

168
00:19:17,167 --> 00:19:21,417
is natural listing, I won't tell
you the company  ‑ ‑ this is an
actual listing, I won't tell you

169
00:19:21,417 --> 00:19:25,625
the company it came from, this
is a decent job listing, I will
show you one that's not sos did

170
00:19:25,625 --> 00:19:30,333
but this one is fine, there
doesn't seem to be anything
wrong with it, we have a new

171
00:19:30,333 --> 00:19:35,958
location here, we haven't seen
this before, and we have a new
skill, that's something they

172
00:19:35,958 --> 00:19:40,917
haven't seen before. If you look
at this over time, you're
watching this remotely,

173
00:19:40,917 --> 00:19:46,917
anonymous, doing the information
gather, you can start to grasp
things, you can check out when

174
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:55,250
new postings come out and new
skills are mentioned, you can
look at when new locations are

175
00:19:55,250 --> 00:20:00,417
mentioned, it's like oh, yeah,
here's did they've never hired a
HR contact representative

176
00:20:00,417 --> 00:20:06,917
before, I wonder what's going on
there, Portuguese? They haven't
needed that before, and an

177
00:20:06,917 --> 00:20:12,375
office in Puerto Rico, what's
going on here? And if you look
at stuff and how the listings

178
00:20:12,375 --> 00:20:18,083
come and go, it starts to paint
a narrative where you can start
figuring out a company's

179
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:24,000
strategic plans, okay? I've been
in a lot of HR meetings and I've
never heard anybody say are we

180
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:30,000
leaking our strategic plans by
listing these job I've never
heard anybody say that. Let's

181
00:20:34,583 --> 00:20:41,792
look at another one. I love this
example. I'm going to advertise
a vacancy we have for an IT help

182
00:20:41,792 --> 00:20:46,833
desk professional, that sounds
like a you nice thing to do, a
hacker comes along and says can

183
00:20:46,833 --> 00:20:51,792
I read between the lines to
learn how to compromise your
network? Let's take a look. This

184
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:57,792
is a recreation of an actual ad,
and this was an actual ad from a
law firm that I used to deal

185
00:21:00,542 --> 00:21:05,542
with, and I saw this published
than I got on the phone, talked
to one of my friends who was a

186
00:21:05,542 --> 00:21:11,792
partner and said you need to
take this ad down now! And so
you look at it and it looks

187
00:21:11,792 --> 00:21:17,375
fine, you know, it's a law firm,
and the company overview, looked
at the description, they have an

188
00:21:17,375 --> 00:21:24,042
immediate opening for an IT help
professional, with remote access
tools like PC anywhere and phone

189
00:21:24,042 --> 00:21:29,000
dial, this was a few years ago.
Talks about the
responsibilities, so yeah, I

190
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:33,667
mean, it looks like a nice
little opportunity for somebody.
And you're like whoa, what is

191
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:39,417
this? They are announcing they
have secret, they're a law firm.
Do they have to announce they're

192
00:21:39,417 --> 00:21:45,500
a law firm? No, no. The IT
people you hire for law firms
are essentially the same IT

193
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:52,792
people you would hire for any
kind of manufacture plant or
whatever you. It's like oh, they

194
00:21:52,792 --> 00:21:56,917
have secrets, we know they have
secret because their a law firm,
we know what kind of secret

195
00:21:56,917 --> 00:22:02,917
these have, they do
acquisitions. So if you deal in
stocks at all, this might be

196
00:22:05,542 --> 00:22:08,083
interesting information, right?
I wonder who's secrets they
have, oh, they've got their

197
00:22:08,083 --> 00:22:14,750
client list. So we though
they've got secrets, we know
what kind of secrets they have,

198
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:22,042
we know who's secrets they are.
Okay. Let's look a little bit
further here. Never say you have

199
00:22:22,042 --> 00:22:27,708
an immediate opening for an IT
position like this, because that
means there's nobody there now.

200
00:22:27,708 --> 00:22:35,167
[ Laughter ] >> No one is
watching the store. What kind of
social engineering could happen

201
00:22:35,167 --> 00:22:41,333
with nobody watching the store,
you know? Oh, they're telling us
how to break into their network,

202
00:22:41,333 --> 00:22:45,875
they're using PC anywhere and
phone dial‑ in system, so you
guys remember how that works

203
00:22:45,875 --> 00:22:51,500
back in the day, you just
started at the bottom of a block
of numbers and starting dialing

204
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:57,875
until you get something that
sounds like a fax machine and
then there's nobody watching the

205
00:22:57,875 --> 00:23:04,500
store, get your things ready,
because we can automate attacks,
right? The other thing is that

206
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:09,375
they're liking the fact they
have problems with remote
access. Okay, so social

207
00:23:09,375 --> 00:23:15,375
engineering‑ wise, I mean, yeah.
And the other thing is this was
the only IT ad they had

208
00:23:17,917 --> 00:23:25,750
advertised and this guy's got
way too many responsibilities.
Helping attorneys, you know,

209
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:30,958
working remotely, responsible
for network security, software
install, license management,

210
00:23:30,958 --> 00:23:35,250
policy development, problem has
to see do some training along
the way, right, this guy is

211
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:42,667
overwhelmed so what can possibly
go wrong? What kind of social
engineering things can you think

212
00:23:42,667 --> 00:23:48,250
of? What I would do is call them
up and ask them, they will tell
me if this job has been filled,

213
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:55,250
oh, yeah, we filled that, great.
You wait for the great to get
settled a little bit, you pose

214
00:23:55,250 --> 00:24:00,917
as one of these attorneys emote,
you're having problems dialing
in, it's 2:00  in the afternoon,

215
00:24:00,917 --> 00:24:06,833
you've got a surprise hearing at
2:15, want to settle things out
of court, you need a paper from

216
00:24:06,833 --> 00:24:12,458
the home office so bad, this
guy's new, he's going to do
everything possible to help you

217
00:24:12,458 --> 00:24:18,458
out. You're in. So be careful
what you put in ad, especially
IT ads. All right. >> [Off mic].

218
00:24:24,333 --> 00:24:30,375
>> Do you ever go fishing, take
a hook out after a fishes mouth
that's kind of the response,

219
00:24:30,375 --> 00:24:36,375
it's like what? Really? Yeah.
Oh, I see. Okay. They did take
the ad down. Okay. Sometimes  ‑

220
00:24:41,125 --> 00:24:46,542
‑ so basically what we talked
about so far is walking websites
and building a database over

221
00:24:46,542 --> 00:24:54,000
time, changes and whatnot.
Sometimes databases are left in
plain sight, and that was what

222
00:24:54,000 --> 00:25:00,750
hand here. This  ‑ ‑ if you
Foley elections at all, this was
one to watch, because it was so

223
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:07,958
bizarre, it was the senatorial
election of 2006 in the state of
Minnesota, it was an

224
00:25:07,958 --> 00:25:15,292
extraordinarily close election.
It was decided by a few votes
after a long period in the court

225
00:25:15,292 --> 00:25:22,417
systems. There was a lot of
shenanigans going to ban back
and forth, a lost accusations of

226
00:25:22,417 --> 00:25:28,625
hacking, a lost servers going
down, a lot of things happening
but probably the strangest part

227
00:25:28,625 --> 00:25:34,625
about this election was the cast
of characteristics involved we
started out from Frank, probably

228
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:44,625
known from his days in Saturday
night live where he was a writer
and a cast member for I think 10

229
00:25:44,625 --> 00:25:50,208
years a long time. Norm Coleman
has a really interesting
political background, he started

230
00:25:50,208 --> 00:25:56,208
off  ‑ ‑ well, his first elected
office he was elected mayor of
St.  Paul Minnesota, he changed

231
00:25:56,208 --> 00:26:02,208
party affiliations and we
reelected. He ran for governor
where he was defeated by Jesse

232
00:26:07,958 --> 00:26:13,958
Ventura, he was the incumbents
in this race and he became the
incumbent because his opponent

233
00:26:16,417 --> 00:26:22,417
died in a plane crash before the
election. And then there was a
third‑ party candidate who did

234
00:26:27,583 --> 00:26:34,125
pretty well, he got a half
million votes, Dean Barkley and
he was most well‑ known for

235
00:26:34,125 --> 00:26:40,125
being the political advisor for
this guy Jesse Ventura, so it
was a very likely election, I

236
00:26:43,833 --> 00:26:49,458
believe Ventura was actually the
governor during this period. Of
what happened is after the

237
00:26:49,458 --> 00:26:55,458
election, after the Norm Coleman
had the most votes not enough to
keep the recount from happening,

238
00:26:59,417 --> 00:27:07,208
after the recount, Al Franken
was ahead by three notes, since
month later they decided whether

239
00:27:07,208 --> 00:27:14,000
or not they were going to count
all of the absentee ballots and
Al ended up winning by 312

240
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:21,167
votes. But like I said, there
were all kinds of charges of
misappropriation of trade

241
00:27:21,167 --> 00:27:27,417
secrets, and in such a close
election, any little dirt you
have on your opponent or

242
00:27:27,417 --> 00:27:33,417
anything is gold. Well, along
the way, somebody came up with a
database of Norm Coleman's

243
00:27:35,792 --> 00:27:41,792
political correcter, their
names, what they did for a
living, Social Security numbers,

244
00:27:47,208 --> 00:27:53,000
their credit card numbers, and
the first thing is we've been
hacked, somebody took our

245
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:59,000
database, no, they didn't, they
actually put it  ‑ ‑ [ Laughter
] >> [Off mic]. >> They

246
00:28:02,833 --> 00:28:09,292
compressed it and put it in a
directory that was unprotected
on their website. If you want to

247
00:28:09,292 --> 00:28:16,042
hear the story behind this,
Richards how a lot of stuff on
YouTube about this but basically

248
00:28:16,042 --> 00:28:22,000
they just left it there and
there's a lot of this going on.
I don't know if you  ‑ ‑ there's

249
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:29,583
a tons of this, one of the
things that I do in addition to
business intelligence, I do a

250
00:28:29,583 --> 00:28:36,167
lot of work with data
journalists, primarily in the UK
and the Netherlands and I love

251
00:28:36,167 --> 00:28:43,833
working with an investigative
journalist because they've got a
hacker's mind, they think like

252
00:28:43,833 --> 00:28:47,583
hackers. You give them a tool,
they run with it, they take all
of their background and

253
00:28:47,583 --> 00:28:51,542
experience and do all kinds of
wonderful things. I have been
doing all kinds of stuff like

254
00:28:51,542 --> 00:28:57,542
this. They were finding like
stockbroker's list of clients
and how much their funds were

255
00:28:59,792 --> 00:29:04,083
and where they had their stuff
distributed and they were
basically just doing Google

256
00:29:04,083 --> 00:29:10,083
hacking is although were doing,
just looking for files. So one
other back story to this one

257
00:29:12,167 --> 00:29:17,750
that I think is kind of
interesting, so I somehow came
across this database, and it was

258
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:23,417
just an Excel spread sheet,
first thing I did was I imported
it into an actual database,

259
00:29:23,417 --> 00:29:27,875
where I could do queries on it
and I was doing queries on it
for a couple of days trying to

260
00:29:27,875 --> 00:29:33,125
find out interesting
combinations of data, and I had
done this before, I mean, I had

261
00:29:33,125 --> 00:29:37,875
worked with a lot of European
newspapers and stuff, on doing
this kind of stuff, mostly from

262
00:29:37,875 --> 00:29:42,458
freedom of information act kind
of stuff and in had enough
information I thought that

263
00:29:42,458 --> 00:29:48,458
probably would have been good
for probably 3 to 5 stories so I
contacted the major news

264
00:29:50,792 --> 00:29:56,208
newspaper Minnesota, told them
what I had done and the kind of
stories they could generate from

265
00:29:56,208 --> 00:30:02,375
this and the response I got was
we have our own IT department,
we really don't need what you

266
00:30:02,375 --> 00:30:08,375
have. All right. Cool. Okay. VNF
can be a major source of leaks,
and especially when it comes to

267
00:30:13,333 --> 00:30:20,083
marketing. You know, some of you
are probably aware of this, but
I've got a couple of examples I

268
00:30:20,083 --> 00:30:26,375
think that are pretty cool. So
you're a marketing person, you
go I need to register so domain

269
00:30:26,375 --> 00:30:31,583
names for new products we have.
Well, the hacker comes along and
says I have been watching these

270
00:30:31,583 --> 00:30:38,042
registrations remotely, I can do
it anonymously and I can
automate the process. Or if I

271
00:30:38,042 --> 00:30:44,042
have $750, I can just buy this
information, a little bit
cheaper, and it's true. You can

272
00:30:46,167 --> 00:30:53,375
see that Apple has registered
about 4500 domain names and for
not a lot of money, you can go

273
00:30:53,375 --> 00:30:58,833
and see what they are all. Do
you think Samsung does this? I'm
sure they've got a copy of it,

274
00:30:58,833 --> 00:31:04,792
you know. The thing that I found
interesting for this is this
particular screen shot I took

275
00:31:04,792 --> 00:31:10,792
during an organizational privacy
talk in Dublin Ireland for the
security forum, so this snapshot

276
00:31:14,042 --> 00:31:20,042
was done in March, they had
4,000  ‑ ‑ 4544 domains on
March  17th. I did this again

277
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:30,917
earlier on just like last week
and they had almost another
thousand domains they had

278
00:31:30,917 --> 00:31:34,917
checked out. Do you think
there's any intelligence you can
gather from those thousand

279
00:31:34,917 --> 00:31:40,917
domains? I'll bet there is. I'll
bet Samsung has that list. >>
[Off mic]. >> They could be

280
00:31:43,125 --> 00:31:47,000
doing that, they could be
diversions, but there's probably
intelligence you could gather

281
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:51,792
from that, as well. The question
was, you know, maybe they're not
real domain names but yeah, I

282
00:31:51,792 --> 00:31:57,042
think you can probably read
between the lines there, too. So
here's another example, this was

283
00:31:57,042 --> 00:32:03,542
an example from a data
journalism class I taught
through the center for

284
00:32:03,542 --> 00:32:09,542
investigative journalism in
London. Keep in mind, this is a
group of primarily journalist

285
00:32:13,250 --> 00:32:19,792
from the UK, they were not
Americans, and I asked them, you
know, knowing what you know, can

286
00:32:19,792 --> 00:32:26,875
you tell me when Sarah Palin
gave first real thoughts, first
documented thoughts about

287
00:32:26,875 --> 00:32:32,292
running for president? So they
were all busy and again,
investigative journalists,

288
00:32:32,292 --> 00:32:36,917
they're like hackers, and they
started looking at DNS records,
I didn't tell them to go to DNS

289
00:32:36,917 --> 00:32:43,208
records, they just went there
and they found this listing by
Jay Griffith who after a quick

290
00:32:43,208 --> 00:32:49,208
Google search you can find out
was her political advisor and he
took out the domains Palin for

291
00:32:52,875 --> 00:32:57,250
president, Palin 2012, right,
that gives you a little bit of
an idea of what they were

292
00:32:57,250 --> 00:33:03,250
planning, Sarah Palin 2012 a and
they were all registered on
August  24th  of 2007, that was

293
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:14,458
pretty much a year before she
was interviewed and before this
ever became  ‑ ‑ before she was

294
00:33:14,458 --> 00:33:20,458
ever even a candidate for vice
president. So there were some
talk in the past. So DNS records

295
00:33:20,458 --> 00:33:26,458
are like a snapshot of the past
like little time capsules.
Employees leak trade secrets all

296
00:33:30,542 --> 00:33:35,667
the time, and they'll do it on a
personal level, just like that
by the number of employees that

297
00:33:35,667 --> 00:33:40,708
you have, that's the kind of
problems that organizations
have. So if you're a HR

298
00:33:40,708 --> 00:33:45,625
director, again, we're taking on
HR, they will say the company is
only as great as their employees

299
00:33:45,625 --> 00:33:50,750
and to succeed I need to train,
hire and retain the very best
ones, I need to invest some

300
00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:56,917
money in them and because of
that, trade  ‑ ‑ your list of
employees is really a trade

301
00:33:56,917 --> 00:34:02,958
secret. So what does a hacker
think? Oh, I hacker thinks
linked in and Twitter is what

302
00:34:02,958 --> 00:34:08,417
they think. Because you can go
on to linked in and within a
matter of minutes I could

303
00:34:08,417 --> 00:34:13,458
probably tell you every  ‑ ‑ for
example every new business
development person in your

304
00:34:13,458 --> 00:34:19,375
company. And if I triangulate
that information with their
endorsements, and what they're

305
00:34:19,375 --> 00:34:25,083
doing on Twitter, I could tell
you who your client list is.
Okay. That's not information you

306
00:34:25,083 --> 00:34:31,083
want to have out. Sometimes you
know, you can't keep people from
using media but you can keep

307
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:41,500
them from doing really stupid
things. This is a case where
this was actually pretty common,

308
00:34:43,792 --> 00:34:49,792
people leaking the code names of
top secret NSA projects on their
LinkedIn profile. You know,

309
00:34:52,875 --> 00:34:57,875
yeah, this is my experience, I
worked on this project. You
know, it's a lot easier to find

310
00:34:57,875 --> 00:35:04,875
out things about projects if you
know what they're called, right?
And I actually, this is not just

311
00:35:04,875 --> 00:35:12,125
snapshot in, this is still going
on, you can't keep  ‑ ‑ excuse
me, you can't keep people from

312
00:35:12,125 --> 00:35:18,125
doing stupid things but you can
monitor and keep an eye on
things, so what I recommend

313
00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:28,125
people doing is use corporate
social media accounts for any
kind of marketing kind of things

314
00:35:28,125 --> 00:35:33,958
that you've got going, in fact,
social media accounts are now
actually being considered as

315
00:35:33,958 --> 00:35:41,250
intellectual property, just the
account itself. There was a case
about a year ago where there was

316
00:35:41,250 --> 00:35:47,083
a salesperson who was Twitter
account very effectively, their
followers were their customer

317
00:35:47,083 --> 00:35:53,083
base and the name of the Twitter
account was something like
bob@ABC company, well, Bob@ABC

318
00:35:59,167 --> 00:36:06,750
company jumped ship took a job
with XYZ company, what does he
do, he renames his Twitter

319
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:14,750
handle Bob@XYZ company, takes
all of his contacts with him,
his former employer sues him and

320
00:36:14,750 --> 00:36:22,333
they won and they determined no,
that is not yours this belongs
to your company. So to avoid

321
00:36:22,333 --> 00:36:28,625
anything like that, use official
accounts that you have control
over, if you're going to go use

322
00:36:28,625 --> 00:36:34,625
social media for marketing. Now,
a lot of leaks you really can't
avoid, a lost them are done

323
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:45,958
transparency for regulatory
purpose, it's worth watching
these things, court record,

324
00:36:45,958 --> 00:36:51,958
people pulling building permits,
there is a lot of information
you can glean by looking all the

325
00:36:54,292 --> 00:37:00,500
things like, you know, licensing
and you know, FCC filing, that
kind of stuff, SEC filings, but

326
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:07,750
you have to make sure your
competition [indiscernible]
degree that these are problems

327
00:37:07,750 --> 00:37:13,750
for yourself it's more about
learning about your competitors
and what I ask everybody to do

328
00:37:16,667 --> 00:37:22,042
is think about what happens if
your website is monitored and if
all the changes end up in a

329
00:37:22,042 --> 00:37:26,875
database some place, would that
change what you put on your
website? I think it probably

330
00:37:26,875 --> 00:37:33,083
would. I strongly suggest,
especially if you're doing new
product stuff, you are picking

331
00:37:33,083 --> 00:37:39,083
out new domains for new
products, use a proxy, don't do
what Apple appears to be doing.

332
00:37:42,542 --> 00:37:48,583
Don't host your own website on
your own network. There was a
case if you're in Las  Vegas

333
00:37:48,583 --> 00:37:54,583
within the last year, where I
believe it was a group
associated with anonymous got

334
00:37:58,250 --> 00:38:05,500
into the Sans corporation, Sans
if you don't live here in Vegas,
they own the Venetian and in

335
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:09,750
addition to breaking into their
website, they discovered that
their website was on their

336
00:38:09,750 --> 00:38:16,917
corporate record so that gave
them access to HR records which
they published and strangely

337
00:38:16,917 --> 00:38:23,375
enough, it also gave them access
to the network where all the
slot machines were. [ Laughter ]

338
00:38:23,375 --> 00:38:30,333
>> So there is no reason to host
your own website on your
network. In fact, I don't think

339
00:38:30,333 --> 00:38:36,583
you should host your own website
anywhere, you should have an
agency do that for you. There's

340
00:38:36,583 --> 00:38:43,708
no reason to do it. And the most
important thing to do, I think,
is to get everybody's buy‑ in,

341
00:38:43,708 --> 00:38:47,500
the organizational privacy  ‑ ‑
that organizational privacy is
important to everybody in the

342
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:53,333
organization. You know, any one
leak basically pulls everybody
down, so you need to get

343
00:38:53,333 --> 00:38:59,167
everybody's buy‑ in and again,
this is a training issue is what
it really is. You need

344
00:38:59,167 --> 00:39:05,500
enforceable policy. How many
times have you seen security
policies that aren't

345
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:11,500
enforceable? You know, there's
as good as not having did
they're worn not having policies

346
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:18,750
because they give you a good
feeling. And when I say
enforceable, they should be

347
00:39:18,750 --> 00:39:23,792
enforceable through tools, there
should be tools enforcing those,
you shouldn't need people to do

348
00:39:23,792 --> 00:39:31,542
it, you know. You should be
doing your own business
intelligence on your own system.

349
00:39:31,542 --> 00:39:35,792
Audit everything that you
publish. Anything that goes out
in your website should be

350
00:39:35,792 --> 00:39:41,250
audited through some group
hopefully that group isn't
marketing, because they're empty

351
00:39:41,250 --> 00:39:48,667
going to get it, okay? Because
the real important thing here is
that security and privacy are

352
00:39:48,667 --> 00:39:55,958
not IT functions, they're
everybody's responsibility. IT
can't protect you from the

353
00:39:55,958 --> 00:40:02,583
nonsense that you showed you
here. Don't disclose a lot of
organizational information on

354
00:40:02,583 --> 00:40:08,583
every job posting. It's not even
important and in most cases it
may you don't even needed to put

355
00:40:08,583 --> 00:40:13,292
the name of your company,
there's no reason to have job
listings on your own corporate

356
00:40:13,292 --> 00:40:19,292
website. There isn't. I
encourage people to use cookies
to track their competitors when

357
00:40:22,375 --> 00:40:27,583
they're coming to their website
and it's good to do cookies and
you start to associate cookies

358
00:40:27,583 --> 00:40:34,583
of known gateways of your
competitors, so that way if you
have their cookies, if they're

359
00:40:34,583 --> 00:40:40,792
using a laptop or mobile device,
if they go somewhere else or go
home and go to your website,

360
00:40:40,792 --> 00:40:44,292
sometimes people will go to your
corporate website and look at
different things at home than

361
00:40:44,292 --> 00:40:51,000
they might at the job. So you
can really screw with people,
too, when you do this. And I

362
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:55,833
suggested this to a number of
clients I've never had one do it
but if you're tracking your

363
00:40:55,833 --> 00:41:00,375
competitors and you've got their
cookies, you can show them
whatever you want, you can show

364
00:41:00,375 --> 00:41:06,375
them different prices, you can
turn it into a recruiting
website to recruit from your

365
00:41:11,542 --> 00:41:17,542
competitors. I would love to see
somebody do that sometime. Okay.
To the that's my talk, thanks

366
00:41:19,750 --> 00:41:25,500
for coming. If you have
questions, we've got a little
bit of time now. We've 5

367
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:30,958
minutes, otherwise, rhyme doing
a book signing at the no starch
booth. Thank you all for coming.

368
00:41:30,958 --> 00:41:32,958
I appreciate it. [Applause] >>
[Off mic]. >> I don't know. >>
[Off mic]. >> We're ready for

369
00:41:32,958 --> 00:41:34,958
questions here at the mic or are
we going to jump right to the
desk? >> [Off mic]. >> Sure.

370
00:41:34,958 --> 00:41:36,958
Your comment about the hacking
with the  ‑ ‑ >> I'm sorry,
what? >> The casino in Las 

371
00:41:36,958 --> 00:41:38,958

comment and presentation about
the casino being hacked. >>

372
00:41:38,958 --> 00:41:40,958
There's a lot of noise. >> Come
on up. >> I understand that  ‑ ‑
you said that you published

373
00:41:40,958 --> 00:41:42,958
donor lists. >> Not in every
case, only certain donors that's
my understanding. >> [Off mic].

374
00:41:42,958 --> 00:41:44,958
>> Okay. Okay. >> [Off mic]. oh,
yeah. >> [Off mic]. Well, a lot
of it is  ‑ ‑ it was also a

375
00:41:44,958 --> 00:41:46,958
political thing. >> Yeah. >>
[Off mic]. >> Okay. >> [Off
mic]. >> Great advice. >> Thank

376
00:41:46,958 --> 00:41:48,958
you. >> [Off mic]. >> No, but
that's a great identify and this
is something that I'm going to

377
00:41:48,958 --> 00:41:50,958
publish. Like I they'd, there's
a lot of awareness about this.
>> [Off mic]. >> Most of the

378
00:41:50,958 --> 00:41:52,958
things don't really
[indiscernible] I mean  ‑ ‑ >>
[Off mic]. >> She was saying in

379
00:41:52,958 --> 00:41:54,958
2007 about running in 2012. Oh,
I see. >> Right. [Voices
overlapping] >> Oh, thank you.

380
00:41:54,958 --> 00:41:56,958
>> [Off mic]. Washington

book signing at noon. Is this

381
00:41:56,958 --> 00:41:58,958
still on? I was asked where the
book signing was going to be. >>
I have most idea what I'm

382
00:41:58,958 --> 00:42:00,958
supposed to do. Sort of. >> Is
this on? Okay. probably, no.
Sometimes I think I do thing

383
00:42:00,958 --> 00:42:02,958
better drunk. I'm not typically
good at [indiscernible] I'm good
at [indiscernible]. So yeah, I'm

384
00:42:02,958 --> 00:42:04,958
not good at single pin picking,
I was submitted for DEF CON was
for a lock pick game, I've been

385
00:42:04,958 --> 00:42:06,958
doing a lot of that recently.
After I leave here, I'm going to
go by me some new toys in the

386
00:42:06,958 --> 00:42:08,958
vendor room. We've got about 6
minutes before we talk again.
How many people here understand

387
00:42:08,958 --> 00:42:10,958
the basis of how tour functions?
Mostly. Okay. I'm going to do a
real quick rehash, I'm going to

388
00:42:10,958 --> 00:42:12,958
try to limit it to 10 minutes, I
have 45 minutes and in want to
get to the main dirt. >> Okay,

389
00:42:12,958 --> 00:42:14,958
