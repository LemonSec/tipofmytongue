1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,360
This is Alex Zacharis and 
Nikolaos Tsagkarakis. I had 
to practice like 10 times. [Applause] 

2
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:19,400
Speaking about airport, excuse
me, speaking about
point of sale vulnerabilities

3
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:26,560
specifically in places that the
TSA will not like them to go home
afterwords, okay? So be nice to them 

4
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:37,260
because they're probably stuck here after
this talk. Gentleman. >> Hello. [Applause] 
Thank you, thank you for the

5
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:44,840
introduction and for the
opportunity. As the introduction
said, we're going to present a

6
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:55,200
case study of an attack of a
point of sale machine that is
placed in an airport. [Inaudible] This

7
00:00:55,200 --> 00:01:01,940
is a real bug found in a real 
airport but we're not going to
disclose the names and stuff like that.

8
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:09,780
Umm, so here you can see
the contents of our presentation,
okay? and now I give this piece 

9
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:23,020
to Mr. Zacharis. >> So, as you   
see here we have lots of stuff 
we're going to discuss about,

10
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:28,280
especially about point of sale
attacks. But before we talk 
about Point of sale attacks

11
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:33,700
let's discuss about
why they choose to target
travelers. So travelers are

12
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:40,460
really vulnerable people.
They're running around trying to
catch a flight and usually they don't

13
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:48,780
think about what kind of wireless
access they use or what machines
they use especially if they trust the

14
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:54,580
place in which they're using
the machine, let's say an airport. It's
supposed to be a place very

15
00:01:54,583 --> 00:02:04,542
trustworthy. So usually you have a
number of travelers running
around, holding many devices and

16
00:02:04,542 --> 00:02:11,083
trying to juggle around trying
to catch his flight and he carries
his mobile phone, he carries his laptop,

17
00:02:11,083 --> 00:02:18,040
he carries his tablet, tries 
to find a connection, check his
emails, maybe his corporate email.

18
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:26,960
I know most of you probably think,
okay, that's not an average security savvy 
guy but a security savvy guy would

19
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:31,620
usually trust a machine 
inside an airport. So we're
talking about these guys too.

20
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:37,620
So let's get a little
a better closeup
look at the point

21
00:02:37,625 --> 00:02:44,940
of sale attack in Transportation.
It's a little bit different than
usual, what we usually know

22
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:54,460
about POS attacks like in commerce store
for example Target where we target
credit card details or web credentials.

23
00:02:54,460 --> 00:03:01,300
In our case we're trying to profile
the traveler so we're looking at
the names, the picture of the traveler,

24
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:06,400
maybe his flight number
his destination, his seat,
who is he communicating

25
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:11,080
and in the worst case 
we're trying to get his 
passport, his ID. So we're

26
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:18,340
talking about this stuff and not
credit cards which is usually
what happens in POS attacks. So

27
00:03:19,625 --> 00:03:26,750
let's go through the ways
usually the point of sale attack
is introduced. There are three

28
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:35,292
ways this can happen. We're talking 
about the first one in our case but I'll
go through all three of them. So

29
00:03:35,292 --> 00:03:42,000
the first thing is when a system
is unpatched and full of vulnerabilities
someone might find out and

30
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,667
exploit the whole system, root the system,
and then get the information he needs out of
the system. The second way is

31
00:03:47,667 --> 00:03:55,167
maybe an employee of a company
which is not aware of how things
work about security, clicks an email,

32
00:03:55,167 --> 00:04:01,307
a link or whatever, introduces
a malware or trojan inside the
company's network and it reaches to

33
00:04:01,307 --> 00:04:06,958
the point of sale system so
that's where you get the
information from. Or the third

34
00:04:06,958 --> 00:04:13,878
way is that the employee himself
is the bad guy, the inside man
that introduces the malware on purpose

35
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:25,200
in order to harm. So first of all
who is going to benefit from
this? Okay. Well, there are

36
00:04:25,208 --> 00:04:31,292
three but maybe more but I'm
quoting three there, Cyber
criminals, usually for identity

37
00:04:31,292 --> 00:04:37,875
theft in the case of passwords
and stuff. Private investigators
who just want to find you, or

38
00:04:37,875 --> 00:04:46,575
maybe the government if they want
to find you and stay off radar. 
What you get out of a point of sale

39
00:04:46,583 --> 00:04:53,223
attack. As I said before we're  
trying to profile the traveler, of
course without consent of the 

40
00:04:53,223 --> 00:05:00,943
airport. We don't get airport 
data to do so, we do it on
our own. So what we can achieve

41
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:08,240
is like at the end of
getting information is 
that we can find out the 

42
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:15,000
destinations and perform 
queries like who's traveling
from Greece to Germany

43
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:22,680
in the last month, who travelled, or
which company is used by most
travelers or what class were

44
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:32,340
these travelers traveling? Or on
a specific flight and date who was
traveling or combination of the above.

45
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:39,760
So here's the case study now. 
We're talking about the real 
airport back home in Greece.

46
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:47,860
And uhh, this really happened.
So the airport has, as most
airports have, different systems

47
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:54,260
that can be exploited the way
we're describing here in order
to steal information. So we have the 

48
00:05:54,260 --> 00:06:00,300
check-in kiosks which probably
you've all used before.
Where you automatically check

49
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:05,420
in and get your ticket and go 
to travel. There are some systems
that in our case we have 

50
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:11,520
exploited but you can purchase
wi-fi time and have some other
information, they're like info kiosks,

51
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:18,040
you can say, but usually
find in many airports. Also we
can find internet access points

52
00:06:18,042 --> 00:06:27,922
and all of them hold information
that could be found useful by us
attackers, in order to exploit and profile

53
00:06:27,922 --> 00:06:35,562
the traveler. Let's get some
more information about the
airport, some statistics to

54
00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:41,740
help us understand about
how big is the attack vector
that we're dealing with and

55
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:44,917
how much the people are
affected and so these are
real statistics from the

56
00:06:44,917 --> 00:06:55,197
specific airport, we're talking
about an average of 12 million
travelers per year of whom

57
00:06:55,200 --> 00:07:03,140
30%, as you can see these are
statistics from 2012 and 2013 I think,
30% are business passengers 

58
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:11,640
which are usually more interesting
to attack or learn more about them.
Let's say, this is a hypothesis here,

59
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:17,560
The first two numbers are real
but the last one is a hypothesis. 
Let's say 100% of them are using

60
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:28,060
a POS system. We're talking about
36,000 people that can be attacked
per year. It seems small but it isn't that small.

61
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,320
So...

62
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:51,000
[Inaudible] >> Keep going
>>OK I'll continue. So we 
chose to attack that specific

63
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,600
machine because it seemed
better than the rest, it
seemed to have less

64
00:07:55,600 --> 00:08:04,640
security, it's supposed to, you can
buy extra wi‑fi time from that. It
accepts coins and bills in order to

65
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:10,360
do so and gives you change
back. You can check your 
flight details by scanning

66
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:18,420
your ticket and you can 
also make VOIP calls. It 
has a webcam in it and there

67
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:25,120
were six machines in there. Yes?
>> Excuse me for a second. May
I take the podium just for a 

68
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:31,160
quick second? >> Yes you 
can Yes, Yes. >> So we have
a first time speaker and for 

69
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:37,460
those of you who are not
familiar for the first time 
speakers [Applause] We have

70
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:44,680
a little bit of a welcoming
tradition here and unfortunately
we don't have any vodka.

71
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:54,040
But, uh, [inaudible] Yeah next
time. >> You guys are from
Greece? >> Yes. Bourbon is fine.

72
00:08:54,042 --> 00:09:04,942
>> We got the wrong information
Cheers. [Applause] >> Yeah.
[Laughing and Applause] 

73
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:19,200
[Inaudible] >> A little bit of
support here. Are you good?
>> I'm better now. >> Would

74
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:28,800
you like some help? >> No,
no. I'm fine. >> Okay you good?
[Laughter and Applause]

75
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:37,620
>> Thank you guys. So I'll 
give the slide from the beginning
because I'm drunk now. [Laughter]

76
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:46,000
So purchase wi-fi time kiosks
You can buy wi-fi time. They
accept coins and bills and

77
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:51,860
they give you change back. 
You can check your flights
through scanning your barcode

78
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:58,180
on your ticket. And you can 
make VoIP calls. They have
a web camera in them. On them.

79
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:03,917
And there are six perfectly
placed around the airport.
So, what a better thing to

80
00:10:03,917 --> 00:10:13,657
attack? So let's go a little bit
more. On them there's a screen
of the wi‑fi purchase, this is

81
00:10:13,667 --> 00:10:24,167
for the VOIP calls and this is
the simplest attack you can do
on them, press alt tab and

82
00:10:24,167 --> 00:10:33,447
escape the front end also yes
the thing didn't work from the
left alt-tab but it worked from the

83
00:10:33,447 --> 00:10:46,620
right alt-tab. They had locked one
key. But this was not the worst
thing. They also had USB port open.

84
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:52,340
So you can understand what's 
going on here. >> Excuse me.
The USB port was clearly 

85
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:58,800
visible when you went
upstairs from arrivals to
departures so when you

86
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:04,460
get upstairs by the automated
stairs then you can see 
clearly the USB ports.

87
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:12,460
>> You are doing the elevation
thing and you are like, Oh
a USBs open there. [Laughter]

88
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:20,240
So, okay, after going a little
bit more about the system
we show the escaped interface

89
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:24,420
 we show that it was Windows
7, it had no antivirus on it,
it had an internet connection

90
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:32,700
because of the VoIP calls,
and of course it was getting
worse and worse because if

91
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:37,440
you would escape that thing
there were processes 
running in the background 

92
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:42,240
that they were actually giving
you full control of the system
I mean, of the pay machine,

93
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:48,520
the cash machine, everything.
So they were running in the
background. Really bad architecture

94
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:56,080
there. So you could actually
pay yourself some money which
we did. [Laughter] Without

95
00:11:56,080 --> 00:12:03,292
using the machine we clicked how
much we want and we said pay and
you know slot machines you've

96
00:12:03,292 --> 00:12:13,232
seen are worse than, I mean
they're harder to get money.
This is real easy. So okay some

97
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:19,040
more pictures here. This is the
communication with the process
behind the front end is talking

98
00:12:19,042 --> 00:12:26,417
to the back end. This makes
sense. It's in Greek but I will
explain. This is how much money

99
00:12:26,417 --> 00:12:34,957
is in there. Around 500 Euro
per machine and the good
thing is you can choose what

100
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:41,600
type of money you want to 
get out of them through [inaudible]
where you can see down there 

101
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:47,960
is you just tick how much money
you want. There is the pay button
in the middle. [Laughter] to get

102
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:55,460
the money out of the system.
So, things were really bad. So
Nik do you want to talk about

103
00:12:55,460 --> 00:13:03,840
how we ‑‑ >> So why this
happen? This happens because
we travel a lot. We're using the

104
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:11,880
airport to go around the 
world working in the security
industry so when this bug 

105
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:17,260
was found then we decided to 
inform the airport because its
not only the risk of losing money

106
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:22,640
at the airport, it's also all
the things an attacker can
do while he has access

107
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:29,440
on this type of kiosks. Okay
so we decided to call the 
airport. When we called the

108
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:35,620
airport they didn't believe us.
They said no, there's no way
you did that. And then we called

109
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:44,620
again. And it was one week
time before they sent people
to check it. After one week they

110
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:49,400
sent people to check the bug
and they called us back and
they told us oh you are lying

111
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:53,760
this is not possible to happen
because we checked it and
it's not happening. And then

112
00:13:53,760 --> 00:14:00,240
we insisted, we said no, it's 
happened. They said come
here to show it to us. And 

113
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:09,060
then we went there to show
to them the bug. So after a
while they decided to fix the

114
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:11,400
alt-tab issue.

115
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:22,420
And then we decided to see
if we can do further stuff
regarding the point of sale

116
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:30,780
systems in the airport and
everywhere else but we did
more testing after they fixed

117
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:38,720
the alt-tab there's still the
possibility to have access
from the Skype interface

118
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:50,440
that locates your flight. They 
do a fork from Skype to Internet
Explorer to where you can see

119
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:55,660
your flight status and where
your flight arrives. Then you
can get access to go into e-mail

120
00:14:55,660 --> 00:15:01,060
and then you can get access
to whatever you want and from 
there you can download whatever

121
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:06,380
malware you want. Also the Internet
Explorer they have is an old 
version, so it's probably exploitable.

122
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:15,240
We didn't try any stuff like this
because it's highly illegal. Okay?
[Laughing] Yes. [Inaudible]

123
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:21,240
So...Just a moment.

124
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:28,700
So we searched the whole
interface and we found these
extra bugs and the other vector

125
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:35,120
we decided to test was the bar
code fuzzing. So you have a lot
of point of sales machines

126
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:42,792
that have this infrared scanner
and from there they pass the
infrared bar codes, they send

127
00:15:42,792 --> 00:15:50,583
information back to the machines
so we decided to build an
application that would generate

128
00:15:50,583 --> 00:16:02,333
not so random bar codes or QR
codes to fuzz applications Here you
can see the interface, you can

129
00:16:02,333 --> 00:16:12,613
see that there's a map showing
the flag if you point there then
it opens up a Gmail account to

130
00:16:12,625 --> 00:16:20,245
the mail to send to look in and
use Google Maps for the
information.

131
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:30,400
Here is the admin interface,
it could be exposed again after
the alt-tab fix, okay so you can

132
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:35,000
have the pay option again for
yourself >> They didn't fix 
anything >> Yeah, they didn't

133
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:42,160
change it. Furthermore this 
stuff, it was a really bad 
application. The service we've

134
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:52,540
seen before. This black screen.
This one? If you closed this
command execution window

135
00:16:52,540 --> 00:17:02,240
the whole service went down
so they executed something like
a script and started CMD shell

136
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:10,875
and then it ran the application,
like that. Whenever you scan the
code there the code was

137
00:17:10,875 --> 00:17:18,750
displayed in this console okay?
So that's one of the means you
can take that passes information

138
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:30,970
from the QR code. We will see the maps
and we will go to the mail
account information. Here can

139
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:40,820
Here you pay yourself, and 
then we go back to the lab.
So, we found that it was very

140
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:47,380
interesting that this kiosk
had webcams in it. So if
you own this part of the 

141
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:52,700
network you can possibly
monitor all of the cameras
in these machines so you can

142
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:56,620
take video of all of the
passengers passing by.
And these machines were 

143
00:17:56,620 --> 00:18:02,458
placed in important places
inside the airport so you can
have a very good view of the

144
00:18:02,458 --> 00:18:13,798
passengers going around. They
then, the malware must have RAM
scrapping capabilities so they

145
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:25,740
can take the information from
RAM of the machine. And the fast
way will be able to fuzz the

146
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:31,310
infrared in the interface and
cause more errors to these 
machines or any other machines

147
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:41,270
like that. So here is the camera
module. We're having issues
because we cannot see the image here.

148
00:18:52,020 --> 00:19:02,000
So the functionality of the kiosk
was the following - whenever you
went there to buy wireless time

149
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:08,460
you had also the capability of
also to get flight information
so you scan your boarding pass

150
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:16,458
The kiosk was decoding the QR
code of your boarding pass then
confirmed it back with the web

151
00:19:16,458 --> 00:19:24,578
service, the flight if it's in
time or your information if it's
valid. That means that kiosk has

152
00:19:24,583 --> 00:19:36,440
access to a service to confirm
passengers, if it turns back the
flight information everything is

153
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:45,960
valid. Or if there is a possibility
for the application to crash.
Also there's a possibility to do

154
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:56,958
network calls, to Skype, to
wherever we go. From what we saw
it was possible to access

155
00:19:56,958 --> 00:20:04,218
whatever you wanted on the
internet from that kiosk so I
will tell later because Alex will

156
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:10,820
continue with the possible risks
that are posing from this kiosk.

157
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:22,440
>> So let's talk more about
the BCB code. Your tickets
have what we say a bar coded 

158
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:28,660
boarding pass. It's actually a bar code
that was introduced by the
International Air Transport

159
00:20:28,667 --> 00:20:36,792
Association in 2005 and more
than 200 airlines use them, and
some of them have a mobile

160
00:20:36,792 --> 00:20:51,332
version. What we saw is that the
more common is the PDF417 and
for the digital type its Aztec

161
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:57,792
code or Datamatrix and QR code
because we couldn't exploit all
of them we decided to do one

162
00:20:57,792 --> 00:21:03,472
from paper and one from digital
so the bulleted ones are
what we chose to talk about

163
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:12,080
and prove our things in real
life through a tool that we've
developed. So a few technical

164
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:20,400
information about the PDF417.
So except from the standard stuff
what's interesting is a linear

165
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:28,000
barcode, it's used in transportation,
identification cards and inventory
management and what a ticket

166
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:38,320
looks like this, this is a QR code
PDF417 code that I scanned from
aerial ticket and it belongs to

167
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:45,740
me and there's information
inside it. You can see the data
under the QR code, under the bar

168
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:54,958
code and I have broken down the
information of each field so you
can see my name, my flight, my

169
00:21:54,958 --> 00:22:02,167
booking, where I'm sitting and
from where I booked the ticket
and which airline I'm using,

170
00:22:02,167 --> 00:22:09,125
my passenger seat, everything is
there. So you know everything
about my flight. Also can you

171
00:22:09,125 --> 00:22:17,880
see if I am business class or
what type of, first class or
what class I'm flying. 

172
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:23,080
Also again, without the code here
we're talking about digital
version of the same thing, it's

173
00:22:23,083 --> 00:22:33,040
usually present in mobile phones
and handheld devices where you
can see the eticket version of

174
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:38,292
that. You can see the standards,
you can see again that it has
less information of the previous

175
00:22:38,292 --> 00:22:44,417
one but again the code has lots
of stuff thats useful to get out
of a machine, so here is the

176
00:22:44,417 --> 00:22:51,750
attack vector all in the machine
that we previously showed, we
can do the following: We will

177
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:59,875
have a traveler going to kiosk
scanning his ticket. We have
malware on that kiosk, the point

178
00:22:59,875 --> 00:23:06,167
of sale malware that we're going
to discuss later about more. it
has RAM scrapping capabilities

179
00:23:06,167 --> 00:23:12,708
so whatever is in its RAM its
ours, we're going to do is we
can exfiltrate that information and

180
00:23:12,708 --> 00:23:17,168
maybe clone the ticket if we
want, so we can get through tax
free area and get some alcohol.

181
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:31,580
So, okay, two things that are
here, the first one is that we
need malware to do these and

182
00:23:31,583 --> 00:23:37,833
then we need an application to
do the duplication or other
stuff that we'll explain later.

183
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:47,373
The malware must have full
capabilities as most malware
must have, and perform the RAM

184
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:53,540
scrapping that we talked about
before in order to get every
ticket that was scanned before.

185
00:23:54,180 --> 00:24:02,292
And what else, maybe exploited
the webcam and get some picture
of a guy scanning so we know who

186
00:24:02,292 --> 00:24:11,832
he is, and of course to do so
you have to hook the barcode
scanner so you can synchronize

187
00:24:11,833 --> 00:24:21,793
the picture taking otherwise
you're taking random pictures
and may have the ability of

188
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:30,720
getting commands through a QR
code so it would just scan a
specific QR code and get money

189
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:36,820
out of the machine because we
can do that. And of course it
would be great if you could have

190
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:45,480
the connect back process. even
if you didn't have that we could
give commands to the QR code

191
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:51,880
again so it's fine So let's go
through that...

192
00:24:55,880 --> 00:25:04,040
Yes, so the image capturing.
The image capturing is harder
than you think, because we have

193
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:12,780
to hook and synchronize the 
barcode scanner with the 
camera and it's not that easy

194
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:20,360
because the RAM scrapping thing
works asynchronous, it runs
like every two hours and gets all

195
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:27,540
the information that is scanned
so you have to just store the images
there, have them in place and then

196
00:25:27,542 --> 00:25:34,708
combine them to see who was
scanning on a specific time it
has some drawbacks so most of

197
00:25:34,708 --> 00:25:40,208
them will have to do with
timing, correlating images with
travelers data, and of course

198
00:25:40,208 --> 00:25:47,542
when you create files inside the
system you might get noticed
easier than without doing so. so

199
00:25:47,542 --> 00:25:54,340
its mostly detectable but you
can actually do that. So a bit 
about the RAM scrapping

200
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:59,180
which is, I believe, the most
interesting part and it's what
categorizes this attack as a

201
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:03,760
point of sales attack. It's the 
RAM scrapping that happens
in every point of sales attack.

202
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:08,458
So you have 3 things you do
in a point of sales attack.
You extract the RAM of the

203
00:26:08,458 --> 00:26:15,500
process that you want, probably
the bar code scanner. Also it's
interesting to attack the

204
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:23,500
explorer process and you should
do it periodically around every
two hours maybe because it's a

205
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:29,417
time consuming process so you
can do it every 5 seconds and
the second thing you do is you

206
00:26:29,417 --> 00:26:35,117
search, you search for the
string thats interesting, in our
case the QR code with your

207
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:42,120
traveler's information which is 
decoded inside RAM so you are
looking for fixed sizes

208
00:26:42,125 --> 00:26:47,875
you are looking for specific
values, which are fixed in
our case, using regular

209
00:26:47,875 --> 00:26:52,333
expressions you get the
information. Sometimes youll
have false positives but get

210
00:26:52,333 --> 00:27:00,250
them too because you can you
know clear things later, and you
store them and the third thing

211
00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:06,792
is the exfiltration, it's a bit
harder because if you have
connectivity it will send back

212
00:27:06,792 --> 00:27:14,667
to you try not to get caught.
And if not you just store them
locally and you go there

213
00:27:14,667 --> 00:27:20,458
physically and send a command to
the QR code and it brings back
all of the information you

214
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:27,583
needed. You get them by some,
you know maybe scan them again
or write them down or whatever.

215
00:27:27,583 --> 00:27:36,000
And you go home. Here's how it looks
when you do it thru volatility
dumping a the process, get the

216
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:45,600
information, this is from a real
machine, done of course on a 
virtual environment but on a 

217
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:51,920
real process scanning a ticket.
And you discard what's not
useful and you get what you 

218
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:58,820
want out of the machine and
the third thing we want our 
malware to do is get

219
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:07,333
commands from aztec code so
you scan a specific QR code
as the code and then do stuff

220
00:28:07,333 --> 00:28:15,250
like example turn on and
off the image capturing or
exfiltrate a specific thing, or

221
00:28:15,250 --> 00:28:20,708
maybe send some network
commands if you wanted to so
that's another thing we want our

222
00:28:20,708 --> 00:28:27,333
malware to do So we have on the
one end we have the malware
standing by on the machine that

223
00:28:27,333 --> 00:28:32,292
we hacked, and then we have
another tool, that's a
multipurpose tool. You can use

224
00:28:32,292 --> 00:28:39,917
that tool in order to do two or
three stuff. I'll explain. It
works again, it's on android

225
00:28:39,917 --> 00:28:49,257
mobile, you will get that
material after the conference,
it has 3 modes, it supports

226
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:57,875
PDF417 and Aztec code, and it
has 3 modes the one is in order
to duplicate stolen tickets. And

227
00:28:57,875 --> 00:29:05,775
the second the PenTest one is
the most interesting mode is
fuzzing the barcode and I will

228
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:12,900
explain later. And you could use
all your favorite commands that
you can store in the text file

229
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:21,020
and load to our fuzzer, ill
explain later and attack the
barcode and the malware command

230
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:27,580
mode where you would send commands
to the barcode from the malware
installed from the kiosk, so the

231
00:29:27,583 --> 00:29:36,000
duplicator looks like this and
we use it for impersonation
reason. so you want to create

232
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:45,160
the ticket that, like this so
you input their information and
you just create another ticket

233
00:29:45,167 --> 00:29:51,250
then you go to the check you
show your ticket, it's valid,
it's from another guy. Try not

234
00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:58,667
to use a woman's ticket if you
are a guy and probably you will
go through that first check and

235
00:29:58,667 --> 00:30:10,887
get that free booze, more
information about the fuzzing.
For the fuzzing we 4 kinds of

236
00:30:10,887 --> 00:30:18,420
fuzzing, string, integer, random
and predefined, you have all
the SQL and XSS on there. It 

237
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:24,417
actually worked in other 
systems. Not that good but it
worked and crashed other 

238
00:30:24,417 --> 00:30:30,333
systems so it's pretty useful.
You should try that download
application and do your own

239
00:30:30,333 --> 00:30:39,593
research if you want. and how
the fuzzing works, you just down
there is the ticket you had. You

240
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:47,958
just place where you want the
files to be and then you start.
It generates bar codes every

241
00:30:47,958 --> 00:30:55,198
five seconds. You can set your
own intervals because the QR
code reader have different

242
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:59,520
intervals depending on the
machine that you are attacking.
So you choose the intervals,

243
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:04,840
This starts generating QR
codes, attacking the QR code
reader. You can stop it at

244
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:11,480
any time, copy the code and
use it later, or stop it and then
go one by one on your 

245
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:19,792
own pace in order to test
the system better. So. And
the last one is the

246
00:31:19,792 --> 00:31:29,412
commands to talk about. So you
can choose what commands you
want to send. You actually send

247
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:36,417
dump RAM commands and you can
perform network scans so you can
actually set on and off the

248
00:31:36,417 --> 00:31:42,477
image capturing thing or you can
cash out money depending on the
command you want to send the way

249
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:48,660
you do it is you select the
command, the command is enabled
through mobile application, the

250
00:31:48,667 --> 00:31:56,080
malware is running on the
machine you want and I'm sending
lets say the last scanned person

251
00:31:56,080 --> 00:32:00,900
command and the malware responds
back with a pop up window this
is the guy this is his picture

252
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:15,660
this is the data. So closing
what you should do and what you
should not do or what you should

253
00:32:15,667 --> 00:32:22,417
do, especially for those
manufacturing jobs like this.
You should use strong passwords

254
00:32:22,417 --> 00:32:28,500
to access the point of sales
devices. You should keep your
point of sales software up to

255
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:37,180
date. This is the most important
thing. You should not use buggy
software. You should firewalls

256
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:43,340
to isolate the point of sales
production networks from other
networks on the internet and

257
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:49,833
it's a good idea to have an
antivirus there not that it will
identify all malware running but

258
00:32:49,833 --> 00:32:56,093
probably some would. Use limit
access to the internet if
possible and disable all remote

259
00:32:56,100 --> 00:33:01,740
access to the point of sales
system and one good idea is to
check both the hardware and the

260
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:07,208
software running from the kiosk
and not separately. You should
check them as a whole. This is

261
00:33:07,208 --> 00:33:12,458
very important. if you want to
identify more and more attack
vectors for the system and keep

262
00:33:12,458 --> 00:33:18,458
it secure so this is all from
me. I don't have ‑‑ you want to
talk more about? >> Yes.

263
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:31,100
Furthermore, just to other
point, you have uh, in
all the airport alot of kiosks

264
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:39,700
like that provide free internet
access or they give you some
functionality to have in the

265
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:51,060
airport to play games or Skype
talk with your girlfriend and do
stuff like that. If you can

266
00:33:51,060 --> 00:34:01,580
imagine, if the attacker can own
these machines which are on the
same network how much time he

267
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:08,700
will need to get deeper into the
airport network okay because
it's not a fact that you can

268
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:17,340
just attack all the passengers
or the machine surf the internet
who put the credit cards. It's

269
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:28,917
not only that. It's the fact
that having an attacker being
there for the infinite time,

270
00:34:28,917 --> 00:34:35,625
that means there will be a case
that people go deeper into their
network, that means a real

271
00:34:35,625 --> 00:34:43,125
threat to the airport.
Furthermore, we have another
room next to us here where they

272
00:34:43,125 --> 00:34:49,250
are developing router exploits
at the moment so I don't know if
the router thats on the file is

273
00:34:49,250 --> 00:34:58,458
not enough so the best solution
for these kind of problems if
you have in a network, kiosks

274
00:34:58,458 --> 00:35:07,998
that provide user services, the
best solution is have physically
have different internet lines

275
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:13,875
different equipment for this
type of information from the
airport. >> Furthermore I would

276
00:35:13,875 --> 00:35:23,995
like to point out that although
this attack seems random it can
get more specific and more

277
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:30,375
personal if you want. using a
little bit of social engineering
So from what you see here it's

278
00:35:30,375 --> 00:35:34,292
like okay, Alex, you are
attacking random strangers
that are traveling but

279
00:35:34,292 --> 00:35:38,875
you are not liking this specific
person that you want to get
information from, well if it's

280
00:35:38,875 --> 00:35:46,250
not true if you get some social
engineering in that, since you
own the machine And most of the

281
00:35:46,250 --> 00:35:53,417
people traveling would probably
think its a safe machine to use
and we can run anything on that.

282
00:35:53,417 --> 00:35:58,542
I could run a campaign like a
phishing campaign on that
machine and then go around to a

283
00:35:58,542 --> 00:36:03,833
line of people awaiting to get
their ticket, one of them is the
guy that I want to attack. And I

284
00:36:03,833 --> 00:36:10,625
will be like oh sir, you are
traveling? Here is a QRcode you
can use that on that machine and

285
00:36:10,625 --> 00:36:18,205
maybe get free wi‑fi. All you
have to do is scan this code and
your ticket and you will get

286
00:36:18,205 --> 00:36:31,780
free wi‑fi. Even worse I would
be like you get some free money
>> 50 bucks. >> So he would be

287
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:39,800
like "oh cool guy" but I get
information. Yes it seems random
but it's not that random if you

288
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:45,292
own the machine and people trust
the machine. You can get them to
use a machine you can get that

289
00:36:45,292 --> 00:36:51,472
machine to work for you in your
favor and you will get what you
want. It's not at random. It

290
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:57,960
seems random but it's not.
That's all from us. Do you have
any questions?

291
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:04,660
[Applause]
