1
00:00:00,125 --> 00:00:05,625
>> The basic topic of my talk is
the burner phone DDoS. It was a
two dollar a day experiment with

2
00:00:05,625 --> 00:00:11,958
one of the Verizon plans that I,
uh, found, so.. It makes about
70 calls per minute depending on

3
00:00:11,958 --> 00:00:17,418
the actual towers that it's on,
so.. And the I I have it
migrating, and I'll go through

4
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:22,920
that pretty quick here so. Okay,
who am I? And what is this talk
about? I don't like this part.

5
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:25,833
and I'm sure the crowds
don't so I'll breeze through it.

6
00:00:25,833 --> 00:00:30,417
It's a little bit about me, I've
done pen testing for ten years.
I went for Computer Science and

7
00:00:30,417 --> 00:00:36,417
geophysics. Got tons of certs.
Nobody cares about them.
Wrote some custom exploits

8
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:44,080
for property management
software, a couple ISP devices,
things like that. ISP specific

9
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:47,580
devices. To reservation
fuzzing. To about nine

10
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:54,920
years of pen testing as I said.
Tons of compliance. Tools of the
trade, I'm going to go over some

11
00:00:54,920 --> 00:01:01,440
actual devices that are really
nice compared to a rubber ducky.
So, creation of call bombing.

12
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:07,440
That's what I'm going to go over
with here. And I'm going to do a
demonstration here and here's

13
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,208
the  ‑ ‑ does anybody use rubber
duckies on any sort of pen
testing audits or things like

14
00:01:15,208 --> 00:01:22,333
that? Anybody play around with
ten (indiscernible) 3.0? Yeah.
If you combine the two in an

15
00:01:22,333 --> 00:01:31,593
iPhone and I do have plans if
you guys want to use one. And
all it tacks is a heat gun. It

16
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:42,740
works a lot better than the
classic USB. This is an RFID
badge reader. It has a gyro

17
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:48,375
sensor to it. When they move in
the chair, right now it beeps.
Every time they scan their card.

18
00:01:48,375 --> 00:01:54,833
It's not cognito, but it
definitely gets the job done.
Okay, we're at a security

19
00:01:54,833 --> 00:02:00,917
convention, I'm just going to go
over these quickly also. Denial
service is when legitimate

20
00:02:00,917 --> 00:02:08,417
services of any kind are denied
to people sending false or over
flow of information. Telephone

21
00:02:08,417 --> 00:02:14,542
denial service is  ‑ ‑ I haven't
seen as much of it on the wild
as I thought I would. Especially

22
00:02:14,542 --> 00:02:18,750
the incidents we've seen
throughout the years and a lot
of the activism type stuff. And

23
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:27,250
basically calls up, there's a
[P]RI. A lot of people don't
have telephone service for the

24
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:31,792
most part anymore. Most of it's
getting switched CIP trunk and PRI
and computerized services.

25
00:02:31,792 --> 00:02:35,875
That's something that is
definitely in the wake now
that's it's more on the

26
00:02:35,875 --> 00:02:43,915
internet. Instances of [T] dos
that I have seen in the wild is
bank fraud. Card not present theft. For

27
00:02:43,917 --> 00:02:51,583
example if my card was being
used in Texas at some gas
station of some choice, Wells

28
00:02:51,583 --> 00:02:56,917
Fargo will actually try to call
me. And the current reasons I've
seen that is they actually TDOS

29
00:02:56,917 --> 00:03:01,542
people's phones on some of
the more premium cards.
Let's see, bank transfer mule

30
00:03:01,542 --> 00:03:09,333
scams, that's going on in LA and
California a lot. Where they tie
up the phone lines on the call

31
00:03:09,333 --> 00:03:18,373
center for the actual banks. And
unintentional spoofed caller ID
scamming. That's one of the

32
00:03:18,375 --> 00:03:26,535
biggest ones. That's the reason
I'm here is because a couple
years back, I came across getting

33
00:03:26,542 --> 00:03:31,500
three calls in the morning right
before I moveed to Minneapolis.
It was a new phone number so I

34
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:37,708
was assumed it was a call of the
previous owner put themselves in
some sort of system, but when I

35
00:03:37,708 --> 00:03:45,917
called back, it had a spoofed
caller ID. So there was this old
man in I think Delaware that was

36
00:03:45,917 --> 00:03:50,177
getting probably, close to a
hundred forty calls a day. I did
call him later in the evening and

37
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:55,220
he said he was changing his
number. And that's what got me
thinking about telephone DoS.

38
00:03:55,220 --> 00:04:04,020
Then there's call center attacks
for IRS. I know there's actual
Government facilities actually

39
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:13,000
getting tons of actual
illegitimate calls and it's
tieing up their lines of

40
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:19,000
service. So political motivated
activism. I have seen a little
bit about it in the wild and I

41
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:26,917
hear about it in the news all
the time. Here's the current
methods of TDOS. The caller ID

42
00:04:26,917 --> 00:04:33,375
reflection spoofed attack. That's one that
I'm going to go over in some
brief detail. There's actual

43
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:37,440
malware on phones. -- I'm sure
you guys, if you've been to any
security conferences in the last

44
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:44,520
few months, actually the last few
years alot of it has been based
around actual malware developed

45
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:51,220
the IOS platform and Android
platform. So, umm. Most of
the methods right now that

46
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:56,920
are being used are actually
hijacked [P]RI and
CIP services.

47
00:04:56,920 --> 00:05:05,260
Provided CIP services. So script
loaded. That's the last one I'm
going to go over actually, it

48
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:13,300
basically loads phone numbers
into pregenerated web pages, and
it's pretty decent. And as far

49
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:18,900
as the actual call volume you can
get. Very little work. So the first
one I'm going to go over is the

50
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:25,200
caller ID reflection attack.
There's spoof caller IDs, apps
on the phone that is call the

51
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:30,200
servers, things like that. I'm
sure everyone's got a blocked
number or a friend that's

52
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:37,100
messing with you one day.
Basically, with this one [P]RI
server you can make 23 calls

53
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:41,980
second to people. You can cycle
through lists depending on what
the actual software running on

54
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:47,720
your computer would be, and it
would IE tie into a soft phone
situation. And call literally

55
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:54,580
hundreds of people and they'll
call whoever the spoof caller ID
info says. And they'll believe

56
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:58,240
that's the actual person who
called them. A lot of them
won't, I don't call back a

57
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:06,780
number if they don't leave a voice
mail. Basically using the salesman to
TDOS for you. So what this does

58
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:14,220
is an actual script that will crawl
several thousand  ‑ ‑ I think it
was 46 or 4800 actual Realtor

59
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:20,240
web pages. Make sure they didn't
have captchas. Some of them use
(inaudible) backends of the lot of the

60
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:28,040
same stuff in them. Very easy to
generate. You put the
information into your text

61
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:33,880
fields and as you can see, right
here, it'll actually put a name,
phone number, things like that.

62
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:40,380
So, that's one of the instances
of getting TDOS in. And here's a
list of the header. They're a

63
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:49,180
little bit larger. So people can
see it. And yeah, like I was
saying about 76 of the web pages

64
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:55,860
out there have  ‑ ‑ they use
pretty much the same template or
a pretty close version of the

65
00:06:55,860 --> 00:07:00,580
actual. And I just wrote a box
of the web pages searching for
key words. Anything with

66
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:09,620
MLS numbers. That's why I
chose Realtors. It's specific to
them so. So yeah, bot nets are

67
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:19,480
infected smart phones. There are
a couple out there. This is just
kind of natural. The next is

68
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:25,060
smart devices. So, there is
an increase on the
(indiscernible) phones you all

69
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:32,620
know. That's one of the risk, we
gladly take. I want to go into
now how I weaponized the OEM

70
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:42,460
cell phone. The prepaid cell
phone we're talking about is
actually a Sam sung U 365. I'm

71
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:46,900
sure everyone at some point in
their life has actually owned
one of them. They're very common

72
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:53,520
phone. So if they're running the
brew 3.1 operating system
digital service. It's a really,

73
00:07:53,520 --> 00:08:00,500
really nice phone, I think they
cost about $8 for Verizon,
and you can buy them for $12.

74
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:06,600
Here's the actual chipset that's in
it, that's one of the reasons I
was able to do the exploit. Most

75
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:12,600
of the smart phones out there
have application processes.
These have one single 100 MHz

76
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:23,860
processer. And the actual attack
would work on any value chip
set. So any of the QSC 6050 and 6055.

77
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:35,060
So. Here's a
little bit of personal research
I've got here. So yeah. Yeah so,

78
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:45,400
they have other nefarious uses
aside from [T] dots. And D dots.
And there were three security

79
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:52,500
features that were built into
the the device. And umm, the
developer editions of these

80
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:57,460
models support boot loading,
unlocked feature sets and I
think things like that. So what

81
00:08:57,460 --> 00:09:03,080
I basically did is wrote custom
firmware for the device. And I
will talk about the way I was

82
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:09,380
able to bypass and get sort of a
pseudo signature at least one that
the device would move with.

83
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:13,940
And loading the actual
recompiled operating system.
Because every single phone

84
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:18,800
vendor has their own operating
system. So I wrote my own, not
my own, it was a modified

85
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:27,040
version of grew. And I will go
into detail for that in a little
bit. So yeah once again, there's

86
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:30,560
no application process sorries,
is anybody in the room looking
at getting into cell phone

87
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:37,260
hacking? And don't? This is the
perfect phone for doing it. I
know you can buy these things in

88
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:44,880
bulk for $8 a piece. And the
burner phones actually have ESN
numbers you cannot activate with

89
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:52,080
regular service. But if you guys
wanted try them out, you can get
locked ones. That's a Verizon

90
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:59,060
account or burner phone for
maybe about six months or a
year, you can pull them --

91
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:06,440
no application processor. It was
written in C++. We got any C++
guys in the house? Anybody

92
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:12,340
program that? Okay, awesome.
That definitely, if you feel
right at home, so, and umm,

93
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:18,080
that's very like I said, it was
very, very easy. I have no
experience. I've root add couple

94
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:24,280
phones, but it was always else's
tool and I was interested in. So
you guys will be able to pick up

95
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:29,940
one of these phones and start
dabbling, it's amazing. I
thought it would be a lot harder.

96
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:33,880
I thought I would have to
have a team of brilliant
Germans working with me.

97
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:38,600
Something to get that little gap
over or something like that. So
that's what it took. I think it

98
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:44,200
took like 15, 1620 people in a
whole community to break some of
the other phones out there. So

99
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:50,540
that's what I'm saying. This is
an amazing phone if you want to
get into cell phone hacking. And

100
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:56,040
there's actual features that are
built into it. When I saw it was
I ringer, I thought it was an

101
00:10:56,040 --> 00:11:02,840
iPhone type deal. But it's
definitely not. It's an actual,
the way it boot it is actual

102
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:07,560
ringtones in the computer,
or in the actual phone.
Sorry about that. I'm

103
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:13,300
able to actually interact with
the clam speaker. So
that's, it's the way they had

104
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:17,600
them built. They had them built
for a lot of extra stuff for a
lot of expansion. And ways you

105
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:22,200
can push  ‑ ‑ for example, if
you want to save your battery
time, you push to a screen that

106
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:30,000
doesn't exist. And the screen
doesn't light up during calls.  
‑ ‑ justideling though, this

107
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:38,200
phone is amazingly efficient I've
literally left one set of my DEF
CON talks and speeches I was at

108
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:43,660
before, and it's been going for
seven days and the battery still
has three bars. Very, very

109
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:48,900
efficient phone. And it's  ‑ ‑
I'll show you some ways to
add stability to it. Where you

110
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:56,500
can get it to go through an
entire five‑ day cycle. You buy
these phones for 12 to $14, and

111
00:11:56,500 --> 00:12:03,500
it comes with $10 prepared. And
$2 a day for unlimited calling.
That plan in itself is pretty

112
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:11,800
amazing. Yup, and clam type
phones. Everybody familiar with
those. They have some features

113
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:20,900
where they can tell if the clam
is open. And the developer, an
OEM edition operators on it, the

114
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:27,800
custom one I compiled, you're
able to bypass anything. Imagine
everything on that phone and you

115
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:36,000
can for the most part interact
with it. When the phone is
actually closed, I did run into

116
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:41,800
some problems, the ones that
have extra screens you can push
it into and things like that.

117
00:12:41,833 --> 00:12:47,792
Yeah, became a lot simpler. I
would go to sleep and be
thinking about it. Like

118
00:12:47,792 --> 00:12:54,083
ringtone. Because that's how the
actual payloads are developed.
You can develop your own, which

119
00:12:54,083 --> 00:13:00,083
are basically malformed ringtone
packets. It's not something they
would have to rewrite. There's a

120
00:13:02,083 --> 00:13:08,292
lot that you can interact with.
Mall form ringtone generator.
And you can actually load them

121
00:13:08,292 --> 00:13:16,000
in that way also, so. And here's
a modified executable was the
way that I actually loaded the

122
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:23,667
actual firmware into the phone.
And the certificate expired in I
think it was 2012. So a

123
00:13:23,667 --> 00:13:30,792
certificate from 2006 to 2012.
This phone's been out for quite
a few years. So yes, basically

124
00:13:30,792 --> 00:13:37,333
the expiration process is the
way I was able to load what
looked like would have been

125
00:13:37,333 --> 00:13:41,833
vendor sign specific. All I had
to do  ‑ ‑ it was a simple work
around, I can't go into too much

126
00:13:41,833 --> 00:13:47,875
detail I guess. I haven't heard
about from call come on it. So
this error is exploited by

127
00:13:47,875 --> 00:13:55,995
modify executable. It'll open up
a couple of the other
interfaces, the way I recompile

128
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:03,208
it had loader of the firmware,
with any valid certificate. So
quite literally  ‑ ‑   ‑ ‑ it

129
00:14:03,208 --> 00:14:08,958
was made to be easy. For you
know, quite literally anybody
can just -- It literally takes

130
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:14,667
about eight‑ minute, the first
time I've been loading the last
few ideas, they were right

131
00:14:14,667 --> 00:14:23,833
around that eight‑ minute range.
So. It allows for one second,
the entire full attack surface

132
00:14:23,833 --> 00:14:30,167
of the computer. So  ‑ ‑ or the
actual phone. So, and it's
amazing. You can enter, you can

133
00:14:30,167 --> 00:14:35,500
actually do a lot of the
bluetooth functionality that I'm
totally excited to have some

134
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:40,333
time again when I get home. I
thought of a couple things and
people have talked to me about

135
00:14:40,333 --> 00:14:47,542
some things that would be
really, really nice to have as a
payload on this phone. So yup as

136
00:14:47,542 --> 00:14:52,583
you can see, the driver device
information are now supported by
expired certificates. And that's

137
00:14:52,583 --> 00:14:57,500
the main reason I was able to by
pass. And that's what I'm saying
A community on the focal, keep

138
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:04,208
these types of things up and not
use. It was a value chip set.
From what I could see, a hard

139
00:15:04,208 --> 00:15:08,625
time to get people to develop
applications for it. That was
one of the reasons I was able to

140
00:15:08,625 --> 00:15:13,708
get quite literally any
information out there. You know,
I did sign up for a couple

141
00:15:13,708 --> 00:15:19,708
things here and there, but as
far as I was able to find most
of the stuff online. So. And as

142
00:15:22,042 --> 00:15:30,840
you can see, it expired in 2012.
And yeah. I did, like I said,
the work around was a modified

143
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:36,833
executable, and it was on the
Samsung side. So it was very, very
out dated. And there was no bad

144
00:15:36,833 --> 00:15:41,042
on their part. I wouldn't  ‑ ‑
this phone is very, very  ‑ ‑
they don't make them a lot of

145
00:15:41,042 --> 00:15:46,542
money off of them. So I would
understand from their aspects
so. But umm, yeah, with a simple

146
00:15:46,542 --> 00:15:55,875
host files work around with
custom filed executable. So. You
can quite literally modify

147
00:15:55,875 --> 00:16:01,750
everything on machine level with
some of the drivers and just the
way it was blocked. It was

148
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:06,708
extremely simple. I couldn't
believe how simple it was
actually for, I'm not much for

149
00:16:06,708 --> 00:16:11,458
cell phone acting. I've never
been part of any communities and
I developed a couple apps here

150
00:16:11,458 --> 00:16:18,667
and there. But it was very, very
minute back in the day. And
here's one of the favorite parts

151
00:16:18,667 --> 00:16:24,500
of the phone. One of the feature
sets preferred roaming list topping.
And basically what it'll do is

152
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:30,500
pull down 12
towers. So you guys we'll
triangulate your your house. You

153
00:16:34,708 --> 00:16:41,458
can lock it and do a random
stand off on three of the tours.
So for the most part, it would

154
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:45,292
be impossible to triangulate
depending on how randomly
you did them. That's also the

155
00:16:45,292 --> 00:16:51,333
vulnerabilities where it's able
to  ‑ ‑ the way it was able to
interact with the towers, I was

156
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:56,542
able to make 70 calls a minute.
So there's no no reason at all
why it should be able to make 70

157
00:16:56,542 --> 00:17:04,875
calls a minute. That's another
thing, the GPS functionality was
very easy to turn off. I found

158
00:17:04,875 --> 00:17:12,833
out it doesn't turn on fully
until you make a 911 emergency
call. It looks like some kind of

159
00:17:12,833 --> 00:17:17,500
interaction with towers on
regular basis. But the GPS
information I was getting was

160
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:23,500
very far off. So, as you can
develop applications for the
attack platform by

161
00:17:26,042 --> 00:17:31,083
emulating the software written
on the phone. You can try it
out. I've wrecked several of

162
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:38,333
these devices. And one of the
actual ways I wrote one of my
ringtone packet's was, one of

163
00:17:38,333 --> 00:17:42,000
them was, that would be cool to
be able to break the phone. By
putting the ringtone in there.

164
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:47,958
And I'll go over that one in a
bit so. But I'm saying, you can
try them on their development platform

165
00:17:47,958 --> 00:17:55,583
them. And yeah. It's pretty
amazing to be able to play with
them before you get them loaded

166
00:17:55,583 --> 00:18:03,542
on the actual system. Okay, so
now you have an unlocked
platform. What now? And umm,

167
00:18:03,542 --> 00:18:08,792
that's what I'm saying, the
attack platform is full control
of the devices on the phones.

168
00:18:08,792 --> 00:18:14,708
And this is some of the payloads
that I actually did. The call
bombs was obviously one of them.

169
00:18:14,708 --> 00:18:20,125
Some of them are default ring
tones left in there. I sent my
number on a number of another

170
00:18:20,125 --> 00:18:31,860
phone that I want to actually
have, do the  ‑ ‑ it'll call
whatever number in the text

171
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:39,240
message 70 time AS minute until
the battery dies in the phone.
That's an extreme amount of

172
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:45,708
calls in a short amount of time
and practically untraceable. And
the other one was if I ended the

173
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:50,958
five‑ day cycle, I set an alarm.
So it'll actually break the
phone. And if somebody was a

174
00:18:50,958 --> 00:18:54,250
little bit better and had a
little bit more time in
programming stuff like that, it

175
00:18:54,250 --> 00:19:00,750
would probably burn out the
flash types scenarios on the
phone. So there'd be ways to

176
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:06,708
make it unrecoverable. So you do
have full access to the actual
phone, all the devices and interfaces.

177
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:20,660
Everybody know what a cheese box
is? Cheese box is what bookies

178
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:29,620
used to use. Where people would
call in and would anonymousize
their phone number on the back.

179
00:19:29,625 --> 00:19:34,625
It wrote a ringtone packet which
helped me to deliver the ring
tones. They bluetooth to one

180
00:19:34,625 --> 00:19:41,875
another. And able to pass the
phone call through. So I call in
one number or have friends call

181
00:19:41,875 --> 00:19:46,995
in one number, and after a
random amount of time, you
could put 15 - 5 second timers, you  

182
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:54,333
could be on different towers. You
could have two phones but be on
separate towers. So it would

183
00:19:54,333 --> 00:19:59,583
make it entirely anonymous. I
know there are services that do
form forwarding and proxying.

184
00:19:59,583 --> 00:20:04,417
And things like that. But this
would be something you could set
it up in 1520  minutes at your

185
00:20:04,417 --> 00:20:11,177
house. I could think of many
reasons  ‑ ‑ this is one of the
ones that I think could be --

186
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:15,580
It'd be nice to have
numbers for calling into
events, things like that

187
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:19,792
maybe back in the day they used
it for, I'm sure people would
have other reasons for doing it.

188
00:20:19,792 --> 00:20:27,208
But there's other reasons
for doing it, so, iPhone numbers
and things like that. So this

189
00:20:27,208 --> 00:20:31,500
goes to show here, you can
connect up to three devices so
you could have random call out

190
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:37,292
numbers even. And basically I
was trying to do a commanding
control thing with an actual

191
00:20:37,292 --> 00:20:45,208
smart phone. I didn't have time
to complete it. And let's see.
Call time is passed. Okay. And

192
00:20:45,208 --> 00:20:55,125
that's basically, like I said,
an untraceable proxy. Yup, this
is another one that I think a

193
00:20:55,125 --> 00:20:59,750
lot of people would have
interest with, a lot of people
are familiar with war demand

194
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:05,280
back in the day where they would
be able to find modem numbers.
This one's basically for finding

195
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:12,292
voice mailboxes. You can turn
the U 365 platform into an
actual crawling platform where

196
00:21:12,292 --> 00:21:16,875
you could go through entire
phone prefixes. Or do
actual voice mailboxes and

197
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:23,458
businesses. And it'll -- If you
bluetooth it to a PC It'll actually
pull  ‑ ‑ it'll pull twice so it

198
00:21:23,458 --> 00:21:28,333
get a voice mail. And then on
the third one, it'll actually
record the voice mail with an

199
00:21:28,333 --> 00:21:33,917
actual program I wrote for my
computer. And the on the next
page you'll see, you can  ‑ ‑ it

200
00:21:33,917 --> 00:21:41,208
comes up to 900 ringtones, or
900 of the actual numbers that
you called. So you can put

201
00:21:41,208 --> 00:21:47,292
ranges in. The portion of the
script on the bottom is for that
one, stuff installed wrong, I

202
00:21:47,292 --> 00:21:51,750
apologize for that. It was just
comment stuff. I know the
original version looked like an

203
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:57,167
Nigerian e‑ mail. You guys
look on your disks, if you
wanted a updated slide

204
00:21:57,167 --> 00:22:06,000
presentation, feel free to e‑
mail me. And basically, the
program that I added two things,

205
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:14,240
it would record MP3 to crawl
mailboxes anonymously. And the
second one is for actually

206
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:18,542
programming the phone I attached
to five of these to my computer
at once. And just hit the go

207
00:22:18,542 --> 00:22:24,520
button. And it gave me
California prefix phone
numbers, once in a while,

208
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:28,840
this kind of thing would be
easily mitigated by people
actually changing the options

209
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:35,700
once in a while not just so
people can just SPAM through
them. So. Yup, and umm, here's

210
00:22:35,708 --> 00:22:43,208
the prepaid cell phone and in
its glory. I just love it when I
have a cellular USB attached to

211
00:22:43,208 --> 00:22:49,208
it. There's actually low energy
mode where I can (indiscernible)
have the thing calling. A little

212
00:22:49,208 --> 00:22:57,000
over 30 calls a minute,stablely
with a USB charger. And just
toss it into a lamp fixture.

213
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:04,167
Anywhere that's like a public
facility. It stayed stably
charged  ‑ ‑ I tried it out with

214
00:23:04,167 --> 00:23:08,750
the, what was it? A 60 or
something like that. And it went
about a day and a half still. I

215
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:15,708
was very impressed. That USB
cellular charger was $6. I
didn't know they've gotten it

216
00:23:15,708 --> 00:23:23,208
cheaper. I would have bought it
a lot earlier. With these phone,
with the way I write my ringtone

217
00:23:23,208 --> 00:23:28,250
packets, there's a couple
options like you compile them or
do really energy efficient. And

218
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:35,400
you could do so much time
basically where you could just
pseudoturn the phone off. That

219
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:42,375
was another ringtone packets
that that I generated. And like
I said, these are anonymous

220
00:23:42,375 --> 00:23:45,708
purchases I bought. They
wouldn't let me buy more than
two of them per day for some

221
00:23:45,708 --> 00:23:52,250
reason. (Laughing) I don't know
if they called and that was
a North Dakota only thing

222
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:57,958
So. They wouldn't let me
buy more than two of them
a day. They're basically

223
00:23:57,958 --> 00:24:04,417
untraceable  ‑ ‑ I just love the
idea of the PRL hopping. It
was something when I perfected it

224
00:24:04,417 --> 00:24:10,792
finally, pulling it down and
actuallying jumping through
random towers, it was, I don't

225
00:24:10,792 --> 00:24:15,000
know, it's a very good  ‑ ‑ it
would be nice for even something
like this or you could do tower

226
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:21,000
blocking. I showed up  ‑ ‑ I've
been in Las Vegas since the
first. And I was able to block

227
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:25,500
the PRL list of the phone.
That's very useful you know
if there's tons of

228
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:30,000
(indiscernible) cells and
fake cell towers in the hotels.
This is one of the only

229
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:35,292
conferences I would expect
we needed to deal of that
kind of stuff. Total investment

230
00:24:35,292 --> 00:24:41,292
for a five day DDOS. It is now
a grandfathered plan, the $2
a day for unlimited calling

231
00:24:41,292 --> 00:24:48,992
I don't know why Verizon 
changed that about a month
ago [laughter] but yeah.

232
00:24:48,992 --> 00:24:56,272
You can get grandfathered
ESN numbers so any of the 
Samsung (inaudible) still gives the

233
00:24:56,280 --> 00:25:03,420
prompts for the $2 a day
plan. These things are cheep. It
has a newer version of brew,

234
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:10,660
it's 1.151. Which is pretty
close to the same, it has an
updated certificate. This would

235
00:25:10,667 --> 00:25:16,667
have to be other methods found.
This is an amazing hand set to
be able to play with if you're

236
00:25:16,667 --> 00:25:24,375
getting into cell phone hacking.
And the phone being turned
into a call bomber. And

237
00:25:24,375 --> 00:25:31,458
like I said, the firmware push,
it's just using a special U[S]B
cable. You don't need to crack

238
00:25:31,458 --> 00:25:37,708
it open and do a bunch of other
stuff do it. It's quite
literally where anybody can

239
00:25:37,708 --> 00:25:43,792
practically do it. So, that's
when it becomes scary. You know,
it's one thing like, how many

240
00:25:43,792 --> 00:25:51,500
people in here if they wanted to
could hijack PRI lines and
CIP trunks? Yeah. That's what I'm

241
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:58,250
saying. How many people in here
can go spend $12 at their
favorite box stores? There would

242
00:25:58,250 --> 00:26:02,500
be a larger majority I would
imagine. And that's when stuff
gets scary. That's why I want to

243
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:09,417
bring this to people's
attention. I know there's like
advanced methods out there.

244
00:26:09,417 --> 00:26:16,375
They're not that advanced once
you understand and experience
with those systems. But, it's

245
00:26:16,375 --> 00:26:21,750
just something I would not like
to have with some of the DDOS
methods. It's something where,

246
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:25,250
it brings it a little more real
world, a little more personal.
It's one thing when your web

247
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:30,958
page goes down, but another when
your coal manager gets locked up
on a situation. It's just on a

248
00:26:30,958 --> 00:26:35,875
different level. It's something
where  ‑ ‑ I've worked on
mitigation method where is

249
00:26:35,875 --> 00:26:40,667
there's a plug in for call
manager and pall manager
express. Where it'll have a cap

250
00:26:40,667 --> 00:26:46,958
show up on the actual device and
system, and you know, their time
a caller ID information that's

251
00:26:46,958 --> 00:26:51,542
plugged in, it'll send a
challenge. So it's something
that people will be able to load

252
00:26:51,542 --> 00:26:57,875
into the actual call manager
software. And another one is an
an DRAD app. Like third time

253
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:07,520
challenges. Something I know
eventually will be used in the
wild more. Yeah, it's near that

254
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:13,520
kind of stuff. It's something
that a lot of people, I think a
lot of people aren't focussing

255
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:17,940
on it as much as they should be.
I've been seeing how much it's
used in some of the bank

256
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:27,120
and stuff of recent so.
So I was going to do a full
blown demonstration of the TDOS,

257
00:27:27,125 --> 00:27:31,458
but there's something really
weird about the cell phone
towers that I was picking up in

258
00:27:31,458 --> 00:27:37,250
the hotel. (Laughing) so umm,
that is the reason that I could
not do my demonstrations to the

259
00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:45,083
fullest extent. And umm, yeah.
It was amazing 'cause as I was
actually booting it up, two of

260
00:27:45,083 --> 00:27:51,333
my phones didn't kick on to the
actual tower. So as you can see
at the beginning here, I had two

261
00:27:51,333 --> 00:27:58,583
phones kicked on, and it peeked
it up and  ‑ ‑ it'd be running
for probably about five, 15 

262
00:27:58,583 --> 00:28:04,167
minutes something like that. And
then I had a little bit of peaks
when I went from the four phone.

263
00:28:04,167 --> 00:28:11,000
When I went from the eight phone
to the ten phone, it locked the
VM up. It wasn't one gig

264
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:19,375
running some older operating
system. This thing was beefy. I
think it was eight and change.

265
00:28:19,375 --> 00:28:26,167
For a life calling operating
system, that is amazingly grade
actually. But you put it  ‑ ‑

266
00:28:26,167 --> 00:28:31,292
could have been an actual, like,
think of the scenarios where you
could actually crash a call

267
00:28:31,292 --> 00:28:37,292
center. Some of the biggest ones
I think about is blocking a 911
emergency system. I could quite

268
00:28:37,292 --> 00:28:46,532
lit literally, I wouldn't do the
call 911. The one that's a 911
basically translated into, and

269
00:28:46,542 --> 00:28:51,042
it could literally take down, I
live in a smaller state, there's
600 something thousand people.

270
00:28:51,042 --> 00:28:56,708
It's growing a little bit with
the oil boom, but it literally
could take down 15 of these

271
00:28:56,708 --> 00:29:04,042
phones. That's scary. That could
deny service  ‑ ‑ if used in
conjunction with other federal

272
00:29:04,042 --> 00:29:08,083
agencies would be entirely
wrapped up. They'd be looking
for hints. If it was used in

273
00:29:08,083 --> 00:29:12,792
conjunction with some sort of
terrorist attack, it would be
unimaginable. And that's what

274
00:29:12,792 --> 00:29:18,917
I'm saying  ‑ ‑ as far as skill
set goes, if somebody was to
release this kind of

275
00:29:18,917 --> 00:29:23,333
dev kit tool to the
wild, it would be  ‑ ‑ like
somebody could get fired from a

276
00:29:23,333 --> 00:29:30,417
pizza delivery place and an hour
later deny service for five
days for $10. That is just,

277
00:29:30,417 --> 00:29:35,458
 Crazy. And
yeah, pretty much any
organization, a person is

278
00:29:35,458 --> 00:29:43,917
disliked, it's just, stores
during holiday seasons. There's
lots of IRS around tax system.

279
00:29:43,917 --> 00:29:47,792
That would actually do financial
damage to the actual
infrastructure of the United

280
00:29:47,792 --> 00:29:54,250
States. And it's amazing how
like a cheap, a little good
phone, cheap phones, but

281
00:29:54,250 --> 00:30:00,417
they're very good. Ive grown close over 
the last few months and. I'm sad to see
it go. Because they literally

282
00:30:00,417 --> 00:30:06,417
came out with the gusto three
where they came into
the mainstream. And I'm going to

283
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:12,667
open it up to questions a little
bit. And I'm going to do some
talking if you don't have any

284
00:30:12,667 --> 00:30:20,500
questions. I always like to give
thanks to my wife and family and
big guy for giving me a sweet computer

285
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:25,708
name. And Tim for final
help on the spellings.
But I'd like to open it up for

286
00:30:25,708 --> 00:30:29,125
questions if anybody has
questions. >> [off mic] 

287
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:41,000
>> Do you have any
mitigation strategies from
the call center perspective?

288
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:46,300
>> Yup, I have actual plugins
for call manager, manager
express, they're CISCO specific

289
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:51,340
right now. But that's just the
world I came from. But it
actually has, the third time it

290
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:55,780
calls in, it has its own
sof  phone. Where it
picks up and challenges you with

291
00:30:55,780 --> 00:31:03,600
a captcha. There's 15 captchas
I developed at this point. Does
that answer your question?

292
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:11,560
>> Yes thanks. >> We should
talk. >> Awesome. >> I actually
spoke yesterday in sky talks on

293
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:17,100
common phone fraud schemes
and demonstrated a TDoS attack
using a compromised PBX

294
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:21,640
>>Perfect >> I guess the
only TDOS scenario you didn't
cover, which by the way your

295
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:27,620
coverage of how they're
generating this was excellent. I
saw a couple I hadn't seen

296
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:34,700
before. But the one scheme
that's used is actually
extortion. So they'll get

297
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:41,120
somebody's information, you
know, usually like loan that
they're behind on or maybe some

298
00:31:41,125 --> 00:31:45,458
sort of criminal history and
call them at work and say hay,
you got to pay us 50 bucks or

299
00:31:45,458 --> 00:31:51,708
we're going to let your employer
know. And they will just, you
know, say the best thing we can

300
00:31:51,708 --> 00:31:58,917
do is take down your place of
work. >> Yup. Exactly. Yeah.
I'll be out in the chain smoking

301
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:04,417
area after this talk. So.
Anybody else have any other
questions? Quite literally any

302
00:32:04,417 --> 00:32:09,792
question here, so. >>Sure,
have you looked into any of
the newer smart phones

303
00:32:09,792 --> 00:32:14,958
burner phones? >> 
I wouldn't feel -- The reason I
went for this platform because

304
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:24,292
of this eight dollars. I have no
problem leaving ten of them in a
library charging. That's scariness

305
00:32:24,292 --> 00:32:30,625
of the platform. Even if it
was my older android phone, I
finally got my two‑ year

306
00:32:30,625 --> 00:32:35,708
free phone again or
whatever. I would feel bad
leaving one of those devices in

307
00:32:35,708 --> 00:32:41,750
places where so much information
is kept. That's why I did it on
the smaller platform. It's

308
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:47,960
literally a burner phone. It is
very, very disposable that's
what I love about it. It's

309
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:56,240
energy efficient. 15  days idle.
That's with the actual  ‑ ‑ if
it wasn't doing phone DO[S].

310
00:32:56,240 --> 00:33:05,000
That answer your question. >> I
was actually thinking about
looking at the newer ones. The

311
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:12,417
smart phones. >> That would be
very, very awesome. Rooted
phones are pretty hard core out

312
00:33:12,417 --> 00:33:17,708
there. Pretty much it's
understand lying on some of the
operating systems is a basic

313
00:33:17,708 --> 00:33:25,667
LINUX distribution. That would be
amazing to see what that could
grow into. So thank you. >> Have

314
00:33:25,667 --> 00:33:31,042
you tried connecting the towers
on on and off as fast as
possible? >> I have actually.

315
00:33:31,042 --> 00:33:36,792
That's one of the ways when I do
a poll of the PRL lists
preferred roaming lists. I

316
00:33:36,792 --> 00:33:43,952
haven't locked at 12 towers
otherwise it was locking the phone up
when I do the full 15 for some

317
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:49,620
reason. I've tried connecting
and disconnecting to powers and
pulling off of other towers and

318
00:33:49,625 --> 00:33:57,083
hopping mid tower. So. Does that
answer your question? >> I was
just wondering if you melted a

319
00:33:57,083 --> 00:34:02,292
cell phone tower doing that?.
>> If I melted? What do you
mean? >> Well like

320
00:34:02,292 --> 00:34:07,917
toggle idle active or
negotiate with the tower
the disconnect. >> It

321
00:34:07,917 --> 00:34:12,458
takes a little bit long
especially on these devices to
do something to the tower that

322
00:34:12,458 --> 00:34:19,500
would be harmful. But that would
be awesome. But yeah, you guys
can get one of these phones.

323
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:28,200
>> (Inaudible) use more phones.
>> (Laughing) . >> Mine's
actually  kind of a follow up

324
00:34:28,208 --> 00:34:33,792
on that. Why is there
nothing in the background?
Why is Verizon not, hey, 70 calls

325
00:34:33,792 --> 00:34:39,252
in two minutes what the hell?
>> I would love to talk to
Verizon about that. Because it

326
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:44,040
was hopping towers and
I don't think -- actually I know for
the most part the towers aren't

327
00:34:44,042 --> 00:34:49,208
talking to each other. Or
they're not talking the way they
should. Is what I mean. >> Is

328
00:34:49,208 --> 00:34:54,417
there something like can Verizon
eventually audit why are we
seeing 10,000  percent more

329
00:34:54,417 --> 00:34:58,833
calls on these four towers.
>> That's the exact reason I did
this. To get it out there, that

330
00:34:58,833 --> 00:35:04,713
kind of stuff shouldn't be
possible. Especially  ‑ ‑   ‑ ‑
even if they want to designate

331
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:10,380
burner phones, this phone in
general, there's no legitimate
reason for it. And that's what

332
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:15,520
I'm saying we're  ‑ ‑ that's
kind of the point I wanted to
bring it out. There are things,

333
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:20,500
there are very easy ways we can
begin with. They could limit the
amount of calls with the burner

334
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:27,958
phones. >> As far as you know they
do none of that. >>Yeah. I have  ‑
‑ >> I am so surprised.

335
00:35:27,958 --> 00:35:32,917
(Laughing) . >> Yeah no, they're
doing a good job of other
things, but it seems like

336
00:35:32,917 --> 00:35:38,208
something  ‑ ‑ I would like to
see what they would be able to
do with it. So yeah. Does that

337
00:35:38,208 --> 00:35:42,208
answer your question? >>Yeah.
Really well. Thanks. >> Does
anybody have any questions?

338
00:35:44,458 --> 00:35:53,338
Quite literally no dumb
questions. So. There's a
gentleman in the back here.

339
00:35:54,917 --> 00:36:00,375
>> Have you tried this with text
message? >> Yes I actually did
fully unlock the [S]M[S]

340
00:36:00,375 --> 00:36:05,750
functionality. I didn't do any
text bombing because I think
there's [S]M[S] service is easy

341
00:36:05,750 --> 00:36:13,120
to do it with. But this would be
entirely anonymous. It's a very
cheep [S]M[S] gateway if you

342
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:17,740
want to connect it to a computer and
send text messages for any
reason. This thing is not only

343
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:23,708
an attack platform, but quite
anything you want to do on a
phone. A couple of these you can

344
00:36:23,708 --> 00:36:28,625
do load balancing. And pretty
interesting. I would love to see
what the community could do with

345
00:36:28,625 --> 00:36:34,580
it. Does that answer your
question? >> Absolutely.
>> Awesome. What was your

346
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:40,580
question sir. >> Have you looked
at whether or not this can deal
with a tower? >> Yeah that

347
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:45,330
that's kind of what my next step
was. But I don't know a good
legal way I could do it without

348
00:36:45,333 --> 00:36:51,333
buying a base station. What I'm saying.
The company I do work for for a
an engineering firm, we do a lot of.

349
00:36:54,292 --> 00:36:59,875
Actual stuff. I would like to
disclaim on that also, this was
done all on my free time. My

350
00:36:59,875 --> 00:37:08,775
work had nothing to do with it.
Aside from, you know, having I
guess a job. What's your

351
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:18,167
question ma'am? >> So it seems
more, I don't know useful, I
guess, to attacking a call center.

352
00:37:18,167 --> 00:37:26,042
But I'm just curious like did
you weaponize this against your
home phone line or your cell?

353
00:37:26,042 --> 00:37:31,750
Just to like  ‑ ‑ what does it
look like from the receiving
end? Would I get 70 empty

354
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:36,958
voice mails from you or what
would happen? >> About the
seventh or eighth call, the your

355
00:37:36,958 --> 00:37:44,292
phone would deauthenticate from
the tower. And literally, you
would pretty much get calls for

356
00:37:44,292 --> 00:37:52,372
the next quite literally until
the battery died in the other
phone. On plain old telephone service

357
00:37:52,375 --> 00:37:58,075
It just rings. It quite
literally just rings. And then
it has a computer behind it. A

358
00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:02,292
lot of it is getting through the
actual cell. I didn't go to the
point where I would block

359
00:38:02,292 --> 00:38:08,000
anything up. I wanted to keep
this legal. Because I do have a
job to keep and stuff. That's a

360
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:15,250
good idea. Like I was say, the
cell phone was the one that
through me off and sometimes

361
00:38:15,250 --> 00:38:19,690
when it was hopping towers
it would quit sending caller ID
info. I would love to dive a

362
00:38:19,690 --> 00:38:23,050
little more into that and that's
why it would be awesome if the
community got behind it

363
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:27,210
because these things are very
easy to break into. Did you have
a question? Did that answer

364
00:38:27,210 --> 00:38:32,750
your question actually?
Thank you.
>> Question for you,

365
00:38:32,750 --> 00:38:40,740
how is anonymity achieved?
Purchasing on Ebay or walking
into a store. >> Anonymity on my

366
00:38:40,750 --> 00:38:47,417
part? I have literally bought
most of them. The ones I was
tinkering with, I didn't pay a

367
00:38:47,417 --> 00:38:53,500
homeless man. I'm not that
paranoid. I didn't pay cash for
them, but I didn't  ‑‑

368
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:59,042
it wasn't -- No, I just wanted
pick them up. I don't know why
they do a two --. One

369
00:38:59,042 --> 00:39:03,792
of my other research materials I
came up with. >> Are you on video
walking into Wal‑ Mart and

370
00:39:03,792 --> 00:39:09,792
purchasing phones with these serial.
numbers >> Yup. They have a couple,
a bit of the information outside

371
00:39:09,792 --> 00:39:14,083
and yeah. So you could, they
could tell what Wal‑ Mart it was
bought at. That's what I'm

372
00:39:14,083 --> 00:39:21,120
saying, I'm sure there'll be a
web page eventually, you can buy
50 or -- does that answer

373
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:30,540
your question? Yup. Okay. What's
your question? >> You mentioned
a little bit about the

374
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:38,375
inaccuracy of GPS. How
inaccurate was it? >> I think it
was 60, 70  feet from the actual 

375
00:39:38,375 --> 00:39:42,708
‑ ‑ unless my phone was off too,
but it looked like it was quite
literally pretty --

376
00:39:42,708 --> 00:39:47,875
You would have been
able to tell the building
someone called 911 from or where

377
00:39:47,875 --> 00:39:55,575
their truck went in the river or
whatever that situation. But
you were able to lock... You can change

378
00:39:55,580 --> 00:39:59,740
the functionality of, I think it
was a star 228 function. There's
another star functioning and you

379
00:39:59,750 --> 00:40:04,708
could adapt to them. They have a
like a little bit more
interaction with the system than

380
00:40:04,708 --> 00:40:10,750
the actual devices did. That's
what I'm saying, you could
reactually plug in, you know,

381
00:40:10,750 --> 00:40:18,125
your actual  ‑ ‑ you could lock
in a location to the exact same
GPS. As long as it's within the

382
00:40:18,125 --> 00:40:23,750
URL. I did find some  ‑ ‑ I
tried to spoof Montana or
everything like that where I

383
00:40:23,750 --> 00:40:28,080
went pretty far away. There were
some towers I couldn't
authenticate to. Does that

384
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:38,700
answer your question? >> Sure.
>>Sure. >> Could you DOS a net
work (inaudible). >> You're

385
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:46,040
talking within (indiscernible)
cell DOS a net work? >> Yeah.
>> I guess in what way would it

386
00:40:46,042 --> 00:40:51,042
be generating traffic. >> Yeah.
>> On the (indiscernible) cell.
Yeah, you could white list it

387
00:40:51,042 --> 00:40:55,167
out with the ones. You could
have 50 phones and nobody else
would be able to talk to

388
00:40:55,167 --> 00:41:01,917
(indiscernible) cell. You could
do it with 25 phones actually.
I think it handles cells

389
00:41:01,917 --> 00:41:07,657
a little bit different, that's
why I couldn't do the
demonstration of it crashing.

390
00:41:07,660 --> 00:41:13,660
(indiscernible). 23 times
five. Over 200 phone numbers. So

391
00:41:13,667 --> 00:41:18,917
yeah. Definitely. Does that
answer your question? >> Yeah.
>> Does anybody else have any

392
