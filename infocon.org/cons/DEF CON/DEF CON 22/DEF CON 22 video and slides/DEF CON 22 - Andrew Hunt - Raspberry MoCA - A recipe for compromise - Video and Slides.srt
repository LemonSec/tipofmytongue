1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,958
>>We have another short talk and
then one more long one and
Andrew here is clearly going to

2
00:00:06,958 --> 00:00:11,917
do another live demo so wave the
rubber chicken in the air and
say the incantations so that

3
00:00:11,917 --> 00:00:17,917
nothing breaks and he'll talk to
us about this rad little Verizon
unit he has here. Give him a big

4
00:00:22,417 --> 00:00:28,417
Party Track welcome. (Applause)
	>> Thank you very much, My name
is Andrew Hunt and I'm currently

5
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:36,083
a graduate student at George
Mason University and also work
at Pac. Tel. So shout out to my

6
00:00:36,083 --> 00:00:43,125
peeps here. Thank you. Standard
disclosure, what I'm doing here
is my own personal work, not

7
00:00:43,125 --> 00:00:49,583
necessarily the views of my
employer. But, it's fun stuff so
let's talk more about it. 	So

8
00:00:49,583 --> 00:00:57,042
the moCA alliance was formed by
a bunch of large companies that
got together and said we have

9
00:00:57,042 --> 00:01:02,625
all this great copper in
people's houses that we have
installed about 30 years of

10
00:01:02,625 --> 00:01:09,250
cable, and they wanted to find a
way to use this as they were
moving into the age of the

11
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:15,167
triple play, being able to
deliver video, voice, and data
over this network. Copper

12
00:01:15,167 --> 00:01:19,542
carries electrons a long way
because it's shielded and it's
got to a pretty nice insulation

13
00:01:19,542 --> 00:01:26,000
there. 	They developed a PHY and
max specifications so that they
would be able to do that, so

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,250
that they would be able to
process package to basically
turn your coaxial bus in your

15
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:38,250
house into a network. The key
point of this is they wanted to
deliver guaranteed bandwidth

16
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:44,958
because this is what video
requires. So that's pretty much
what MoCA looks like, it's in

17
00:01:44,958 --> 00:01:51,542
your house, it's coaxial cable,
everyone knows what it is. This
is what it looks like a little

18
00:01:51,542 --> 00:01:57,833
bit. They use, at the PHY level
they are using signaling
division -- frequency,

19
00:01:57,833 --> 00:02:04,375
divisional multiplexing. I found
this graphic on Wikipedia but it
actually works really well, for

20
00:02:04,375 --> 00:02:08,292
what they are doing with MoCA
and dividing it into two
channels. There's a WAN channel

21
00:02:08,292 --> 00:02:15,208
and a LAN channel, two operate
at two different frequencies but
standard. 	They use this to be

22
00:02:15,208 --> 00:02:21,333
able to talk with the router and
also to have the router talk to
other devices on the coax. On

23
00:02:21,333 --> 00:02:28,625
top of that, they overlay a,
well, thank you! -- (Laughter)
So. 	>> Woo-hoo! (Cheers and

24
00:02:28,625 --> 00:02:34,625
applause) 	>> Somebody has done
the research, this is pretty
good shit. 	 The Mac layer

25
00:02:40,542 --> 00:02:45,750
basically over these channels
are dividing it up by time so
they can create variable length

26
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:52,583
frames which means that they can
encapsulate things in them and
that could be video which has

27
00:02:52,583 --> 00:02:57,458
very big frames and also
Ethernet packets, Ethernet
frames, they will encapsulate as

28
00:02:57,458 --> 00:03:03,750
well. Running at the standard
100 megabits per second PHY they
can guarantee a sustained rate

29
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:11,083
of 54.6 5 megabits per second.
Consider what your typical
Ethernet looks like and

30
00:03:11,083 --> 00:03:17,292
collisions are going that's
actually very good for 100
megabit rate. They're

31
00:03:17,292 --> 00:03:23,292
everywhere. Everywhere you see a
DVR setup box, everywhere you
see these routers here, they are

32
00:03:26,042 --> 00:03:32,042
using MoCA. Which means that it
is a great exposure. It's
everywhere. 	You'll typically

33
00:03:34,625 --> 00:03:39,750
see these enter the home through
something call wall works on the
outside of your house. This is

34
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:43,500
the one outside of my house
that's opened up but there are
different ones. You might have a

35
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:47,958
smaller one if you have a cable
provider that's bringing it in.
It won't have this big optical

36
00:03:47,958 --> 00:03:54,708
network terminator but basically
just a splitter that splits off
to the rest of your house.

37
00:03:54,708 --> 00:04:02,542
That's a good point of entry.
	On the inside you have this
router so every cable company

38
00:04:02,542 --> 00:04:08,750
gives you some kind of a router
to parse up these streams and
packetize them. Read the packets

39
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:13,250
they are sending to you and push
it out over the network. They
typically have a SBI firewall to

40
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:19,083
divide the inside from the
outside as is standard network
security practice. 	They also

41
00:04:19,083 --> 00:04:25,667
have on the left side of this
little picture -- uh-oh -- on
the left side of this little

42
00:04:25,667 --> 00:04:31,667
picture they've got the coax
binder there, the plug but it
actually carries two MoCA nodes,

43
00:04:38,208 --> 00:04:44,125
called network connected --
we'll talk about that later.
They also provide a

44
00:04:44,125 --> 00:04:49,083
MoCA-Ethernet bridge on both of
those nodes that basically
allows them to encapsulate the

45
00:04:49,083 --> 00:04:55,875
frames onto the coax. So, they
now turned your nice coax bus in
your house into a large Ethernet

46
00:04:55,875 --> 00:05:01,708
system. 	This supports your
digital Video recorder so your
DVR requires time, you have to

47
00:05:01,708 --> 00:05:07,542
be able to schedule shows and
find out when everything is.
That's the prime function of

48
00:05:07,542 --> 00:05:13,333
having Ethernet on that, to be
able to tell when to record your
functions. 	So, yes, sir?

49
00:05:13,333 --> 00:05:19,708
(Laughter) 	>> May I borrow
podium for a second. 	>> All
right. 	>> If you are a new

50
00:05:19,708 --> 00:05:24,458
speaker, raise your hand.
Awesome! [Cheers and applause]
Are you familiar with this

51
00:05:24,458 --> 00:05:30,458
tradition? 	>> No, I'm not. 	>>
Really? Do you drink? 	>> Yes, I
do. 	>> He brought his own. 	>>

52
00:05:32,917 --> 00:05:39,875
You just -- you provide it for
me. 	>> Every new speaker at DEF
CON, see, they know this, how do

53
00:05:39,875 --> 00:05:45,875
you not know this, every new
speaker does a shot onstage. 	>>
Okay. 	>> How about love for our

54
00:05:49,667 --> 00:05:55,667
new speaker? (Applause) 	>>
Great. Congratulations, quick
shoutout from the guys at

55
00:05:57,708 --> 00:06:02,667
Whiskey Pirates that gave me
this. Pretty awesome. I see we
have a pirate in the audience.

56
00:06:02,667 --> 00:06:07,083
	>> Tell him how you got it. 	>>
He chained him to a radiator and
had their way with him.

57
00:06:07,083 --> 00:06:13,083
(Laughter) 	>> Some kind of
pirate. (Laughter) 	>> Thank
you. 	>> Okay, so what just

58
00:06:19,375 --> 00:06:26,000
happened here, let's go back one
slide. What this is doing, this
is action tech is bridging your

59
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,417
Ethernet and coaxial bus which
means if you have a coaxial
splitter as most of you do

60
00:06:31,417 --> 00:06:35,750
somewhere around the house that
splitter is carrying not only
the WAN traffic that is supposed

61
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:42,500
to be going out to the biosfeed
but also carrying your LAN
traffic on a different channel.

62
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:46,625
If you notice on the left you
have a MoCA LAN, Ethernet LAN
and wireless LAN. The action

63
00:06:46,625 --> 00:06:52,042
tech router bridges those
together and most of the do.
That just makes it easier to

64
00:06:52,042 --> 00:06:58,958
manage the notes on the device
so you can see everything, nice
big happy broadcast network.

65
00:06:58,958 --> 00:07:05,667
Same domain. 	It's great!
Except, oops. You can take over
all three networks by plugging

66
00:07:05,667 --> 00:07:11,458
into that splitter. If that
splitters happens to be outside
your house, as this gadget

67
00:07:11,458 --> 00:07:18,375
diagram depicts, but is also
similar to the Cox, Comcast and
Verizon default installation

68
00:07:18,375 --> 00:07:23,458
guides for field technicians,
they want it on the outside of
the house because it's easy to

69
00:07:23,458 --> 00:07:30,958
maintain and install. 	So now
that we know the LAN is exposed,
just walk in and plug in. All we

70
00:07:30,958 --> 00:07:38,250
need are a couple items, things
we usually locate here at the
utility point of presence so all

71
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:42,208
I have to do is walk around some
houses and look for the utility
pole, on the outside of your

72
00:07:42,208 --> 00:07:48,208
house look for the electrics
box. Yes. 	>> Drink! 	>> Yay!
(Pause) (Applause) 	>> All

73
00:07:54,708 --> 00:08:00,042
right. So you'll need a couple
items and you'll be able to go
on this fishing adventure. A

74
00:08:00,042 --> 00:08:06,042
MoCA Ethernet bridge. Mine is
net gear MCAB 1001 and then
you'll need some RG6 coax cable

75
00:08:11,208 --> 00:08:18,042
and a greater than one GHz
splitter line, line splitter.
Plug that in, I had to color

76
00:08:18,042 --> 00:08:23,542
invert this picture because it
was almost impossible to see if
you were just taking a picture.

77
00:08:23,542 --> 00:08:29,125
I had to invert it to see that
x-ray image. It's hard to see
when it has cover. Which is

78
00:08:29,125 --> 00:08:36,833
great for us! 	The action tech
LAN does not also engage any of
the encryption features provided

79
00:08:36,833 --> 00:08:44,500
by the MoCA protocol. It does
have a -- I believe it's 40-bit
key DEZ that is a pre-shared key

80
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:50,292
but you can code into it. It is
used on the WAN side of the
connection that has the key that

81
00:08:50,292 --> 00:08:56,292
Verizon knows but it's not on
the LAN side. It's open, clear,
hey, works with everything

82
00:08:58,458 --> 00:09:03,500
because it's consumer-friendly.
	So basically what happens you
had a MoCA device on the outside

83
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:07,958
of the house, it connects to
your action tech router, your
action tech router says hey and

84
00:09:07,958 --> 00:09:13,958
lets you on the Ethernet. Pretty
awesome. 	So as y'all have seen
this since 2001, typical

85
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:21,083
Ethernet line of attack, this is
your normal traffic flow but I
really don't want you to go that

86
00:09:21,083 --> 00:09:27,333
way, I want you to come to me
first and I'm going to do unholy
things to your traffic. 	So I

87
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:32,625
think we have belabored this
point. What could possibly go
wrong? We all know what can go

88
00:09:32,625 --> 00:09:39,458
wrong. We have known about it
for a decade. 	Yeah, whatever.
Take the device, take it over

89
00:09:39,458 --> 00:09:45,792
and get the more persistent
presence. One of my co-workers
actually brought up to me and

90
00:09:45,792 --> 00:09:51,583
says but I'm protected. I have
this MoCA filter. So MoCA
filters are great, they

91
00:09:51,583 --> 00:09:58,583
physically block the MoCA ranges
in the bandwidth. What they are
designed for is blocking these

92
00:09:58,583 --> 00:10:02,750
signals between one house and
another. So you can't block it
within your own house otherwise

93
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:09,125
your DVR won't work. So it has
to be located on the egress of
the splitter that they are using

94
00:10:09,125 --> 00:10:15,417
to provide the cable signal to
your house. That's usually on
the outside of the house. But

95
00:10:15,417 --> 00:10:19,750
even if it's not it's usually
not in a place where you could
divide the inside of the house

96
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:24,708
from the outside of your house
because if there's any cable
exposed that is carrying your

97
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:31,083
internal connection all you have
to do is splice it and you're
done. 	So, great idea but it's

98
00:10:31,083 --> 00:10:36,542
not going to work for this
particular purpose. 	So, the
idea here is to be able to build

99
00:10:36,542 --> 00:10:40,333
a disposable attack unit. So
yeah, we can walk up but yeah,
someone is going to find that

100
00:10:40,333 --> 00:10:43,917
lap top. So we built a
disposable attack unit that is
small, that can hide under a

101
00:10:43,917 --> 00:10:49,917
bush and lasts forever, and
allow you to walk away and go do
your evil. To illustrate this,

102
00:10:52,083 --> 00:10:57,458
you have some requirements. You
have to have some point of --
some way of providing power. You

103
00:10:57,458 --> 00:11:01,500
have to be able to physically
insert or demonstrate with that
is and you have to have some

104
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:06,875
type of compute device to
execute these attacks. Once it's
installed you have to be able to

105
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:14,542
access it and then commit some
type of attack, redirection and
manipulation. 	The objectives of

106
00:11:14,542 --> 00:11:19,708
this is do no harm so first of
all, I'm really just here to
demonstrate the problem, but you

107
00:11:19,708 --> 00:11:24,958
know I'm sure people out there
could take it to the enth
degree. Want to use some

108
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:30,500
standard tools. We do not want
to expose ourselves by showing
everyone our latest and greatest

109
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:34,542
coating techniques and be
profiled and arrested. We want
to use common stuff that

110
00:11:34,542 --> 00:11:40,042
everybody has. Needs to be
updateable so we can a few
change things, or add new tools.

111
00:11:40,042 --> 00:11:44,625
Needs to be disposable, so we
don't care if we lose it. That
basically means it has to be

112
00:11:44,625 --> 00:11:50,292
cheap and has to be small and
not too powerful, because if it
is too powerful it will burn up

113
00:11:50,292 --> 00:11:56,500
all our battery before we have
even gotten home. So, some
ingredients I just recently

114
00:11:56,500 --> 00:12:04,250
purchased these gorilla 16 800
milla amp batteries, got two of
them on woot. Thank you woot.

115
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:10,250
Smaller than a paperback book, I
used two of these because I have
two because I have two different

116
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:16,375
draws on my units. MoCA draws
one amp and the raspberry unit
draws half an amp and that's a

117
00:12:16,375 --> 00:12:22,000
little more than this can put
out on one battery so I need two
batteries. 	I also used the

118
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:27,833
raspberry pie, Model B. Has an
ARM 11 processor. It's a little
bit slow but doesn't consume too

119
00:12:27,833 --> 00:12:34,667
much power, can last 18 hours on
this battery and it's cheap, so
if somebody finds it go buy

120
00:12:34,667 --> 00:12:41,917
another one, buy 10. 	So Kali
Linux has a distribution that
works amazingly well with

121
00:12:41,917 --> 00:12:45,875
raspberry pie and the ARM
distribution, thank you, guys,
for that contribution to this

122
00:12:45,875 --> 00:12:52,250
field. It's awesome. Has all the
necessary tools you need pearl
python and also squid Apache and

123
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:58,250
mini PUMP. Let's talk about that
later. 	It also supports the
universal plug and play IGDE

124
00:13:00,375 --> 00:13:06,125
protocol which is available on
the action tech firewall and
then you'll also need the

125
00:13:06,125 --> 00:13:11,833
Ethernet bridge. I bring this
picture up, I don't know if you
can see it down there but the

126
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:18,333
original MCAB mockup that I did
before I modified it had a -plug
that you had to plug into an AC

127
00:13:18,333 --> 00:13:23,125
adapter in order to provide
power. Looking at the back it
was 5 volt, one amp which means

128
00:13:23,125 --> 00:13:27,667
that it is within the USB
specification for power draw.
So, a little hardware hacking

129
00:13:27,667 --> 00:13:34,458
later and soldering up and you
have a USB power cable for the
MCAB. I recommend it because

130
00:13:34,458 --> 00:13:39,583
then you can provide it direct
off battery. I was originally
trying to do this work with the

131
00:13:39,583 --> 00:13:45,208
APCUPS. Only lasted about six
hours and it beeped a lot. I
didn't think that would be very

132
00:13:45,208 --> 00:13:49,125
good for hiding it from
attackers, outside of someone's
home if they were looking for

133
00:13:49,125 --> 00:13:53,958
the freaky beeping. Also this
nasty habit of shutting things
down before I was done with it,

134
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:58,750
I'd get about halfway through
the battery and say oh my God
I'm out of power and shut it

135
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:03,292
off. These batteries are a real
God send. They came out in the
last couple years, they are

136
00:14:03,292 --> 00:14:08,250
really great. There is no loss
of conversion from DC to AC to
DC, there is just direct power

137
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:14,250
which means they lasts longer.
	So on each of these devices
MCAD adapter I've got about 14

138
00:14:16,375 --> 00:14:21,250
hours of up time so that's about
how long you've got to commit
whatever you are going to do.

139
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:24,583
	For those who can't see it on
stage, this is what it looks
like, a bunch of rubber bands

140
00:14:24,583 --> 00:14:29,333
and duct tape. But, it's dark,
you can spray paint it and hide
it under a bush and no one will

141
00:14:29,333 --> 00:14:35,292
see it. Word about universal
plug-and-play, I know this is
kind of beleaguered by GRC and

142
00:14:35,292 --> 00:14:42,375
other sources but it enables,
it's a PMP protocol that enables
Gateway manipulation, the action

143
00:14:42,375 --> 00:14:48,583
tech supports this. Basically it
allows, everything talks to
everything and says hey I'm an

144
00:14:48,583 --> 00:14:55,042
iPhone, hey I'm a printer, let's
talk, right. Downside is also
hey I'm a router, you want a

145
00:14:55,042 --> 00:15:01,042
firewall port opened, let me do
that for you. 	So I borrowed an
idea from Joshua Wright, his

146
00:15:03,625 --> 00:15:09,167
scripts for doing image high
jinks with the I Love My
Neighbors distribution. I

147
00:15:09,167 --> 00:15:16,333
borrowed those from him, did
modification and some batch
scripting and now we have a nice

148
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:22,375
little device that will go and
punch holes in firewalls from
the inside. 	Mini PMP is

149
00:15:22,375 --> 00:15:28,958
basically what we use here,
PMPCA, tell it to forward 22 to
myself and send a nice little

150
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:36,875
report to my e-mail address and
tell me what my internal and
external IP and port are. This

151
00:15:36,875 --> 00:15:42,583
might be a little hard to read
for you guys but basically you
will turn on your engine. You

152
00:15:42,583 --> 00:15:47,625
are going redirect web streams
and then to you'll manipulate
that stream. So, let's see if it

153
00:15:47,625 --> 00:15:53,625
actually works. (Pause) All
right. Nope. (Pause) All right.
There is my MoCA device there.

154
00:16:34,833 --> 00:16:40,833
63... Aww, it doesn't like my
key. (Pause) (Laughter) 	>> You
want me to get through this demo

155
00:16:52,375 --> 00:16:58,375
or you want me to drink? 	>>
Drink! 	(Laughter) 	>> While
this is loading up, I'll take a

156
00:17:03,542 --> 00:17:09,542
drink. Okay, that's on and now
we have to do one more thing.
What that's doing is going

157
00:17:31,375 --> 00:17:37,375
through its sequence. I owe you
a drink. (Cheers and applause)
The sequence it was doing, it's

158
00:17:42,042 --> 00:17:47,792
just going through and doing the
normal networking stuff, it's
also engaging over the MoCA

159
00:17:47,792 --> 00:17:54,000
network which is then going to
poison the action tech router.
If you want to play along, get

160
00:17:54,000 --> 00:18:00,375
laptops out and want to connect.
The access point password is
testing 123 testing 123 SSID is

161
00:18:00,375 --> 00:18:06,375
testing. So, go ahead and play
with me. I don't see any takers!
{{(Pause) We are getting to the

162
00:18:13,833 --> 00:18:18,458
end here. It's going through the
set up sequences. It's going to
engage the squid engine and web

163
00:18:18,458 --> 00:18:24,375
server, it basically provides
the redirects and squid proxy is
going to redirect to pearl which

164
00:18:24,375 --> 00:18:30,375
is going to do the re-writing of
the sequence to provide the
re-directs. Okay. So let's get

165
00:18:33,042 --> 00:18:39,042
through. While that's going on I
can go ahead and show you this.
So you enumerate the redirects,

166
00:18:41,583 --> 00:18:47,583
it's not there yet, that one has
failed. Oh, there it is. So you
can see there are all kinds of

167
00:18:50,083 --> 00:18:55,583
redirects from things like
Microsoft, they've got all kinds
of protocol in there that they

168
00:18:55,583 --> 00:19:01,583
contracted to get on the action
tech. But you can see here this
is my PP and C this is my port

169
00:19:03,625 --> 00:19:09,625
forward for my SSH to my router.
So that can be reached through
the Internet and then want to go

170
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:17,750
for it, give it a go! All right.
There we go, somebody is on here
and they are getting redirected

171
00:19:22,167 --> 00:19:28,167
around and if we try it, so we
can stop them... (Pause) Look at
that! It went somewhere else.

172
00:19:35,292 --> 00:19:41,292
Can't see it. There we go. So
anyway, not too exciting but the
entire point of this

173
00:19:49,958 --> 00:19:55,917
demonstration is to show the
MoCA network is exposed to the
outside of your house, anyone

174
00:19:55,917 --> 00:20:01,917
can walk up with no keys, can
walk up and take over your
network and do whatever unholy

175
00:20:01,917 --> 00:20:09,250
thing they want to do with you.
So I just have a couple wrap-up
slides and then we're out.

176
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:15,250
(Applause) So basically some
results from this research, the
arm 11 is single core, low power

177
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,375
drive, but it's also kind of
pokey. If you actually do use
this, don't try to do any image

178
00:20:23,375 --> 00:20:28,000
processing it will show itself
very quickly but it's great for
injects, redirects, and things

179
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:36,000
like display. So tested it with
my network at home, it has about
a dozen devices on it, works

180
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:42,000
just fine. So it's cheap. It's
disposable. It's quick delivery.
Walk up to a house and install

181
00:20:45,042 --> 00:20:49,333
this in less than 2 minutes walk
back to your car and drive away
and you have all afternoon to do

182
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:55,792
what you're going to do. Allows
you to find a more permanent
back door. So what do we need to

183
00:20:55,792 --> 00:21:01,625
do about this? You need to talk
to your ISP, tell them you want
them to allow their devices to

184
00:21:01,625 --> 00:21:08,875
support better encryption, since
the DVR tends to break when you
turn on encryption on that local

185
00:21:08,875 --> 00:21:15,583
LAN. The ID do not want IGD, you
want disable turned off whatever
because you can't turn it off.

186
00:21:15,583 --> 00:21:22,125
It's a Daemon and you can't
disable it. You want them to
stop bridging all your networks

187
00:21:22,125 --> 00:21:27,208
together on the same domain and
actually have it route so you
can do something with it instead

188
00:21:27,208 --> 00:21:33,625
of having it just lave
everywhere. 	Customer should
demand this, you guys should

189
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:38,208
demand this. Ongoing work on
this, we want detect these MoCA
injections, people installing

190
00:21:38,208 --> 00:21:43,375
these devices, we want to be
able to alert on insertion, but
something better, you could it

191
00:21:43,375 --> 00:21:49,250
and see the poisoning that's
going on here but you can't see
the MoCA side of it. You want to

192
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:53,167
be able to see that. We're
currently working with a
gentleman named Steven Barani,

193
00:21:53,167 --> 00:21:59,250
he is a fellow grad student of
mine and we're working on a
product called Slim and then

194
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:04,500
integrating that into another
raspberry unit that will face
off with this one called counter

195
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:10,500
pie and hopefully able we'll be
able to demonstrate that soon.
Thank you. (Applause)
