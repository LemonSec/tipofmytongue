1
00:00:00,042 --> 00:00:06,458
>> Welcome to old school hacking
Porn Free! And I'd like to
introduce Major Malfunction, but

2
00:00:06,458 --> 00:00:10,542
before I turn over the mic, I
just want to point out that if
there's any under age folks in

3
00:00:10,542 --> 00:00:18,417
the room, this is going to be a
little bit racy, so --
[Applause] Bear that in mind

4
00:00:18,417 --> 00:00:23,500
that if your parents are in here
with you, you might want to go
walk about but that being said

5
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:30,125
-- >> My parents are with me. >>
Well, there you go. Major
Malfunction! [Applause] >> Thank

6
00:00:30,125 --> 00:00:36,125
you. And you'll notice I hadn't
actually put my name on the
slide, so I was hoping to kind

7
00:00:39,333 --> 00:00:46,042
of make this anonymous, so.
[Laughter] And I'm sorry by the
way if I've just ruined a

8
00:00:46,042 --> 00:00:53,375
favorite childhood song tune of
yours. You'll never hear that in
quite the same light again. And

9
00:00:53,375 --> 00:00:57,125
actually, the words even, you
know, if you start hearing the
words and think of it in this

10
00:00:57,125 --> 00:01:03,125
context, it starts to mean
different things. It's kind of
weird. So let's get on. So I'll

11
00:01:05,833 --> 00:01:13,708
make a few disclaimers first.
I'm going to do a live demo, the
reason this talk is so late is

12
00:01:13,708 --> 00:01:19,708
because now in the UK it's after
midnight, so draw your own
conclusions from that.

13
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:27,500
[Laughter] He says it's going to
be a bit salty, I have no idea,
it may be a bit salty, it may be

14
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:33,500
a bit Granny, who knows.
[Laughter] I have no control
over what's going to happen. So

15
00:01:37,208 --> 00:01:43,208
the live demo may not work. It
may work, but you may wish it
hadn't. [Laughter] And some

16
00:01:48,208 --> 00:01:54,625
warnings. I believe in
responsible disclosure.
Everything I do for white hat, I

17
00:01:54,625 --> 00:02:00,625
try and disclose bad stuff to
people. I am disclosing now
there will be sexual content

18
00:02:05,042 --> 00:02:11,042
probably, or at least what
passes for sex in the UK after
midnight. [Laughter] And as it

19
00:02:13,667 --> 00:02:17,875
was mentioned earlier, there may
be some young people here. We've
got some young people here,

20
00:02:17,875 --> 00:02:23,875
we've got what was called DEFCON
Kids last year, I think it's now
Roots, very cool program. So

21
00:02:26,208 --> 00:02:32,208
I've made a DEFCON Kids friendly
version of this slide. [
Laughter ] >> How inappropriate

22
00:02:37,458 --> 00:02:42,958
is that? Actually looking around
the room, I was wondering just
how appropriate is this talk for

23
00:02:42,958 --> 00:02:49,500
DEFCON and there's so many bad
people here. What's wrong with
you all? Jesus. Didn't you read

24
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:57,417
the synopsis? Actually, the
creepy thing is that slide,
that's the original. [ Laughter

25
00:02:57,417 --> 00:03:03,417
] >> That's the modified slide.
[Laughter] Yeah, a little site
called dancing bear. Yeah.

26
00:03:07,875 --> 00:03:13,875
Jesus! What the... okay. Okay.
So one of my roles here, I'm a
goon, I run chem stores. I got

27
00:03:19,167 --> 00:03:25,167
given a patch . Yes, you have
wasted 15 plus years of your
life at DEFCON, so. [Applause]

28
00:03:37,375 --> 00:03:43,458
>> So for years one of my jobs
has been when we do spot the
Fed, now I'm not sure because

29
00:03:43,458 --> 00:03:47,083
I'm kind of stuck in the back
room and I hear rumors, there
are talks and stuff, and I don't

30
00:03:47,083 --> 00:03:52,458
really get to see it, we used to
do spot the Fed and people would
drag it up on the stage, you

31
00:03:52,458 --> 00:03:58,583
remember the early days of
DEFCON, Feds would try and sneak
in, we would see a guy with

32
00:03:58,583 --> 00:04:03,583
like, you know, really short
hair and loafers and white socks
just like, trying to blend in

33
00:04:03,583 --> 00:04:10,458
with a Polo shirt and we'd go,
ooh, wonder who he could be? So
we would drag him up on stage

34
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:15,625
and make them admit they're a
Fed and when they did they got a
T-shirt that says "I am the

35
00:04:15,625 --> 00:04:22,667
Fed." And the guy who spotted
them would get a T-shirt that
said "I spotted a Fed." Is that

36
00:04:22,667 --> 00:04:28,875
still going on? Are people being
dragged up on stage? No? Now we
need to, you know, we need to

37
00:04:28,875 --> 00:04:36,333
introduce that. So anyway these
T-shirts have become such a
thing that they actually -- oh,

38
00:04:36,333 --> 00:04:42,333
dear. [Applause] >> If they make
me drink now, it is all gonna go
horribly horribly wrong. >>Just

39
00:04:48,042 --> 00:04:54,042
keep going. >>Holy crap! >>Bad
people! >> Yeah. >> Okay. So
while they're getting ready,

40
00:04:56,458 --> 00:05:02,458
I'll finish my point, shall I?
So in the early days, the
criteria for being a Fed was you

41
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:11,583
had to, when you came to claim
your T-shirt, I would say, try
and figure out if they were a

42
00:05:11,583 --> 00:05:17,250
real Fed as far as we were
concerned. And the criteria was
you had to have power of arrest

43
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:24,583
and you had to carry a sidearm
and that's what Feds did, you
know, 15 years ago. Since then,

44
00:05:24,583 --> 00:05:30,625
we've gone all cyber, and so now
you've got cyber Feds, and so we
were talking about, well, what's

45
00:05:30,625 --> 00:05:37,333
the criteria now? Well, you
know, you're a Fed that works in
cyber. So you don't need power

46
00:05:37,333 --> 00:05:43,333
of arrest, you don't need a
sidearm 'cause your weapon is
the Interwebs. So-- >>Be quiet!

47
00:05:46,625 --> 00:05:51,208
[Laughter] >> He's gonna spoil
my big joke! >>All right. So,
you know, we do this thing about

48
00:05:51,208 --> 00:05:56,125
new speakers but some of us have
been here so fucking long, we've
rolled over back to 0, so... [

49
00:05:56,125 --> 00:06:02,125
Laughter ] >> I suppose that's
fair enough. [Applause] >> All
right! Second one? >> No. >> All

50
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:21,083
right. [Laughter] >> Thank you
guys, that's very thoughtful of
you. Okay. So cyber Feds, so it

51
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:31,708
seems to me the Feds have gone
full cyber on us. Now you get an
FBI warning at the beginning of

52
00:06:31,708 --> 00:06:37,708
your porn. [Laughter] Porn's on
the internet, but that doesn't
make it cyber, but apparently it

53
00:06:40,667 --> 00:06:46,417
does. So the FBI are now the
guardians of all porniverse.
[Laughter] Imagine some Fed and

54
00:06:46,417 --> 00:06:52,417
I wonder if it's just the FBI,
or in the UK, you know, the Feds
all kind of step on each other's

55
00:06:56,083 --> 00:07:01,250
territory, so I'm just wondering
if the NSA and the CIA and all
those guys are also, oh yeah,

56
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:07,125
we're gonna regulate as well,
so. What are you doing tonight
darling? I'm working on a really

57
00:07:07,125 --> 00:07:13,125
big national important project--
[Laughter] We've got to make
sure they're all under 18, it's

58
00:07:16,625 --> 00:07:22,625
national security, you know. Did
I say under 18? They're fucking
me up already, over 18!

59
00:07:25,958 --> 00:07:30,333
[Laughter] So just in case you
weren't sure where we're going
with this talk, that's the

60
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:36,917
quality we're going for, okay?
So if youngsters in the room
want to stay, well I know that

61
00:07:36,917 --> 00:07:44,667
you do, duh. [Laughter] Parents
of youngsters in the room, I
hold no responsibility for what

62
00:07:44,667 --> 00:07:50,667
happens next. Ok, so, obviously,
we're going to be talking about
some taboo subjects here and

63
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:59,583
we're gonna have to confront
some difficult subjects I
suppose. And, you know, talk

64
00:08:03,667 --> 00:08:08,750
about the origins of this, you
know, where did, this is hard.
And I've kind of envisioned

65
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:13,542
saying this, I felt like it was
going to be a lot easier, but
you know, I'm going to have to

66
00:08:13,542 --> 00:08:21,375
admit some stuff here. But what
do I do, where does this stuff
come from? I travel a lot, ok,

67
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:28,375
I'm on my own. [Laughter] I'm in
a hotel room, no one to really
keep an eye on me and see what

68
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:34,375
I'm doing. You know, people do
stuff. And actually, before I go
any further, this kind of sexism

69
00:08:38,083 --> 00:08:44,917
thing works both ways right, if
I was a girl up here, about to
say what I'm about to say, some

70
00:08:44,917 --> 00:08:50,917
you of, well probably half of
you would think it was pretty
cool. [Laughter] Some of the

71
00:08:54,333 --> 00:09:01,750
guys, too. Sorry. Some of the
guys, too. But, you know, a guy
doing it, that's just sad, okay,

72
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:09,708
and I do it, well, I must admit,
I've been doing it a lot
recently. So you know, when I'm

73
00:09:09,708 --> 00:09:15,708
on my own I'm not in the room on
my own, I admit occasionally I
do use -- oh, God! [Laughter] >>

74
00:09:19,417 --> 00:09:25,417
Java, so there! [ Laughter ] >>
Don't judge me! So I know you
guys do, but I'm a Python guy,

75
00:09:34,042 --> 00:09:39,917
so I'm kind of used to that
semi-strictness, you know, we
think we're kind of the hipsters

76
00:09:39,917 --> 00:09:45,667
of programming, it's all nice
and neat and tidy, but we can,
we're free rolling and we do

77
00:09:45,667 --> 00:09:52,625
what we like. Not like the Perl
guys just all over the shop. So
Perl guys, they use Java when

78
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:59,208
they want a bit of strength, you
know, so we're used to it, we
have to do indentation. So

79
00:09:59,208 --> 00:10:05,417
anyway, enough of the
disclaimers, we put the
difficult bit out of the way and

80
00:10:05,417 --> 00:10:12,083
now we're going to get on to the
talk, so starring, obviously...
[Music Playing] >> That's not

81
00:10:12,083 --> 00:10:19,625
me, hang on. There we go!
[Laughter] [Music Playing] >>
You do realize the descriptions

82
00:10:19,625 --> 00:10:25,625
of these pictures are all
painted with bodily fluids,
right? [Music Playing] >> Ok.

83
00:10:29,458 --> 00:10:35,458
Previously seeing stuff I've
done before, so I did some hotel
TV hacking using infrared.

84
00:10:38,458 --> 00:10:44,458
[Applause] >> Thank you. And
funnily enough, what came out of
that, who knew? There's boobies

85
00:10:47,958 --> 00:10:54,917
on the hotel TV. And then I did
some satellite hacking. Anyone
see that? [Applause] And, guess

86
00:10:54,917 --> 00:11:00,917
what? >> All right, all right.
You're over stimulated. Let's
get some beer in you and then

87
00:11:04,083 --> 00:11:11,458
it's right to bed. >>Woohoo! >>
That was a bit distorted. She
said, "You're over stimulated,

88
00:11:11,458 --> 00:11:18,875
let's get some beer in you and
get you off to bed." Okay. So in
this talk we will also be

89
00:11:18,875 --> 00:11:24,875
starring: [Music Playing]
>>Which kind? >>Which kind? The
BBC. The British Broadcast-- oh,

90
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:33,083
sorry, I'll just play. This is
her majesty's television.
[Laughter] [Music Playing] So in

91
00:11:33,083 --> 00:11:37,625
the UK we didn't have any TV so
she said you know, well I'm
gonna make me a television

92
00:11:37,625 --> 00:11:43,625
company. [Laughter] And we have
this thing called the red
button. So we're going to be

93
00:11:46,375 --> 00:11:52,375
playing with the queen's red
button in this, so. [Laughter]
Is that wrong? We're going to be

94
00:11:56,500 --> 00:12:02,500
looking at a thing called
MHEG-5, which is ISO 13522-5
apparently. Otherwise known as

95
00:12:07,958 --> 00:12:13,958
how to transmit porn. [Laughter]
[Music Playing] >> And the
culprit space station extra, so

96
00:12:18,667 --> 00:12:24,333
you see in the UK, we only have
one X, you guys are all XXX, one
X is enough for us because we're

97
00:12:24,333 --> 00:12:29,833
British you know. [ Laughter ]
[Music Playing] >> And these
guys are pornographers,

98
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:35,833
obviously. Television X again,
just the one X for you, Brit.
And again, pornographers. Okay.

99
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:49,625
Sorry about the background
noise. And sorry about the
cheesy 70s porno font that's too

100
00:12:49,625 --> 00:12:55,625
hard to read. So MHEG, what is
MHEG, so it's basically an extra
service. It was designed to

101
00:12:58,167 --> 00:13:04,167
provide kind of, text, textual
services on top of the broadcast
TV, but it's a bit more

102
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:14,292
powerful. It's like the old
teletext. In fact I call it
teletext on steroids so you can

103
00:13:14,292 --> 00:13:19,250
do really quite cool things with
it, you can actually stream
multimedia within your textual

104
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:25,250
environment and you can create
games and so on. It's basically
an ASN.1 encoded program that's

105
00:13:31,292 --> 00:13:37,292
transmitted alongside the video,
the digital video and audio and
it gives you the ability to

106
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:45,667
create objects, move things
around, as I said, stream audio
and video, it can store stuff

107
00:13:45,667 --> 00:13:53,042
locally for replay or it can
pull it off the air. And it kind
of looks like this. It's, this

108
00:13:53,042 --> 00:13:57,417
is, you'll notice I didn't use
the porn font there so you can
actually read the bloody thing,

109
00:13:57,417 --> 00:14:03,417
but this is -- it's essentially
just a very simple programming
language. It's interpreted and

110
00:14:07,625 --> 00:14:13,625
executed by the TV itself. What
could possibly go wrong? [
Laughter ] >> So let's get on to

111
00:14:18,417 --> 00:14:24,417
her majesty's red button. So red
button is a service that uses
MHEG, so on every BBC channel

112
00:14:26,708 --> 00:14:32,958
you've got the option to press
the red button, so this guy in
the top right-hand corner, if I

113
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:38,958
press the red button, it will
pop up some MHEG content and
we'll start to see, you know,

114
00:14:41,125 --> 00:14:47,125
options, what we can do within
the channel, so we choose a
sub-menu and this is pretty

115
00:14:50,292 --> 00:14:58,292
cool, it then minimizes, I mean
it's a bit like the EPGs you get
on the TV, so that's probably

116
00:14:58,292 --> 00:15:02,917
written in something similar, so
it minimizes you've got the
picture in picture and you can

117
00:15:02,917 --> 00:15:10,500
go off and do other stuff but
it's designed for information
and added value services so it's

118
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:18,208
supposed to enhance the channel
you're already watching. But now
they've, some bright spot said

119
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:24,458
wow, ooh, we could use it and do
something secure with it. So
they've created some secure

120
00:15:24,458 --> 00:15:32,417
channels that use MHEG.
Basically pay per view. So the
challenge is how do you create a

121
00:15:32,417 --> 00:15:36,667
pay per view system when you
don't have an infrastructure for
pay per view, you don't have a

122
00:15:36,667 --> 00:15:40,917
head in, you don't have a back
channel, you know, you don't
have any way of injecting a

123
00:15:40,917 --> 00:15:47,750
specific authorization code to a
specific crypto card that's
listening in like a normal

124
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:53,750
encrypted scrambled channel
would. So they figured out we
can do it with MHEG. [Audio

125
00:15:57,625 --> 00:16:03,625
clip: Boobies] Did I say that
out loud? So where can you do
it? Embedded TV, all modern TVs

126
00:16:06,625 --> 00:16:12,875
support MHEG, it happens I have
a couple of devices at home,
Samsung TV, there's a really

127
00:16:12,875 --> 00:16:16,375
good site if you have a Samsung
and you are interested in
figuring out what goes on under

128
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:24,167
the hood. Samygo.tv. Really
detailed stuff. It hasn't
actually gone that far, they're

129
00:16:24,167 --> 00:16:28,833
still figuring out what they can
do with it, at the moment you
can pretty much just Telnet to

130
00:16:28,833 --> 00:16:35,667
that sort of logging console. On
the HUMAX devices they've gotten
further, so hummy.tv, they've

131
00:16:35,667 --> 00:16:41,833
actually got a complete
distribution that you can load
on to your HUMAX and you then

132
00:16:41,833 --> 00:16:47,833
get SSHX, you got full root onto
the box, so that looked like the
ideal place to have a go. So

133
00:16:50,625 --> 00:16:56,625
here's my HUMAX box, I'm shelled
in as root, you can see in slash
bin, it's just a standard busy

134
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:04,375
box distribution, so pretty much
fair game, anything I want to do
I can do on here. I can compile

135
00:17:04,375 --> 00:17:10,375
my own code, I can you know, do
whatever I want. Unfortunately,
it then turned out that the

136
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:18,375
actual executable is just one
giant binary, every single
function in there is just done

137
00:17:18,375 --> 00:17:25,458
in one giant binary, and so it
looked like it was going to be
pretty hard to actually reverse

138
00:17:25,458 --> 00:17:32,083
it, I would have to reverse
engineer that entire binary
file. So then I thought well,

139
00:17:32,083 --> 00:17:38,292
why not just do it, you know,
I've already got a PC, there are
cheap dongles available, I had

140
00:17:38,292 --> 00:17:44,750
the same issue when I was doing
satellite hacking. I initially
started on an intelligent

141
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:50,542
satellite box on an embedded
Linux box and ended up just kind
of battling with the Linux, with

142
00:17:50,542 --> 00:17:55,125
the distribution and with the
functionality of the satellite
box in order to do what I

143
00:17:55,125 --> 00:18:01,708
wanted. So I'm like okay, screw
that, I'll just do it on the PC.
Buy a cheap little DVB dongle,

144
00:18:01,708 --> 00:18:07,708
plug it in, see what happens. So
what happens is you end up with
a very simple structure,

145
00:18:09,708 --> 00:18:15,958
basically when you start pulling
the data out of the stream, you
end up with this tree, so you

146
00:18:15,958 --> 00:18:23,125
have a direct tree with three
subdirectories in it, cash,
carousel and services, and in

147
00:18:23,125 --> 00:18:28,917
the services directory there's a
channel number, and within that,
it points at a carousel, and

148
00:18:28,917 --> 00:18:35,625
within the carousel there's
individual files. There will
always be a file called A or

149
00:18:35,625 --> 00:18:41,625
Start, and that's the file that
runs first. And if you look at
it, it's this ASN.1 encode

150
00:18:44,583 --> 00:18:51,458
binary blob, and again we've
already seen that, if I encode
that specific blob, that's what

151
00:18:51,458 --> 00:18:57,000
it looks like. The tools are
readily and easily available,
there's a MHEG encoder and

152
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:01,875
decoder, which will, so it
decompiles, so you just take the
binary, so you run it through

153
00:19:01,875 --> 00:19:07,875
the decompiler and you get nice
commented, or not commented but
you know, easy to read code.

154
00:19:10,458 --> 00:19:16,458
These guys incidentally, is the
actual PIDs of embedded or
multiplexed streams coming down

155
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:26,125
on the transport stream. Okay,
so what are our targets? We've
already discussed Television X

156
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:33,167
and BabestationX but there is
also this thing called Top Up
TV, so there's talk of believe

157
00:19:33,167 --> 00:19:37,208
it or not did not start as, oh,
I'm going to hack some porn,
although obviously it's a

158
00:19:37,208 --> 00:19:43,208
benefit. But there was this
service called Top Up TV and Top
Up TV was basically was what it

159
00:19:46,625 --> 00:19:50,875
sounds like, you know, it was
extra services, pay per view
services doing things like

160
00:19:50,875 --> 00:19:56,083
educational programs and so on,
so I was curious, that's what
got me curious, how secure this

161
00:19:56,083 --> 00:20:02,083
stuff is. Then I went to their
website. Top Up TV has ceased
broadcasting as of last

162
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:12,333
November, it's like, dammit!
That's the consumer side. If you
click on the business button,

163
00:20:12,333 --> 00:20:18,333
oh, well, this is what we do, we
have pay TV experts, we can help
you do pay TV systems, and BT

164
00:20:22,042 --> 00:20:28,458
Sport so I guess they're doing
stuff for BT Sport, so maybe
there's a target there. So

165
00:20:28,458 --> 00:20:31,375
should we look up BT Sport.
Obviously not. [Laughter] Unless
you're into beach volleyball or

166
00:20:31,375 --> 00:20:37,375
something, and it's you know,
it's not a very common sport in
the UK so forget that. Back to

167
00:20:43,417 --> 00:20:51,250
Television X. So how do they use
MHEG to create pay per view
content. So basically it's very

168
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:55,333
simple, when you connect to the
channel, it doesn't give you a
video stream, what it gives you

169
00:20:55,333 --> 00:20:58,500
is a little program and the
program pops up this picture and
it says if you want to receive

170
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:04,500
this content, you have to join
our little club and it costs you
10 pound a month and you do it

171
00:21:09,375 --> 00:21:17,292
by pressing the red button or
the blue button and it will then
take you to another page and

172
00:21:17,292 --> 00:21:23,292
they give you a challenge. So
the challenge is basically so
this is the text example, so you

173
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:32,000
text this number, 364245 to that
number, and you will get back a
PIN which you put in here and it

174
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:41,500
will then unlock the screen and
take you to the content. If you
type 123456 which you do to

175
00:21:45,083 --> 00:21:51,083
experiment obviously, wrong PIN,
doesn't let you through, you do
that three times and it starts

176
00:21:54,292 --> 00:22:00,708
again, so the challenge will
change, you don't get to brute
force that PIN. And so my first

177
00:22:00,708 --> 00:22:08,458
idea was okay, well, I've got a
running environment, why don't I
just freeze it, take a snapshot,

178
00:22:08,458 --> 00:22:13,708
and then just go back and brute
force, do three, start again, do
three, start again so the state

179
00:22:13,708 --> 00:22:18,333
is contained and I actually
brute force the whole thing but
then I realize actually it's a

180
00:22:18,333 --> 00:22:24,333
6-digit number so that's a lot
of trouble even for the reward
of you know, boobies, so.

181
00:22:27,583 --> 00:22:35,333
[Laughter] So I have to come up
with a different scheme.
BabestationX, same thing, live

182
00:22:35,333 --> 00:22:40,125
shows, only they're cheaper, 5
pounds but that's per night
actually, so they're not

183
00:22:40,125 --> 00:22:46,750
cheaper, really. Press your red
button, same deal. Off you go,
send that number, get back an

184
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:52,750
unlock code. Put in 123456, PIN
is incorrect, please try again,
exactly the same deal, you get

185
00:22:54,917 --> 00:23:00,917
three or four goes, then it
resets. [ Laughter ] >> You've
always got to get your toll out

186
00:23:09,125 --> 00:23:16,833
in a porno scenario, so. Okay.
So that's what we're doing, I'm
going to have a go at both of

187
00:23:16,833 --> 00:23:22,833
those channels live. [Applause]
So, I'm sorry, this will take a
few seconds to get going. So I'm

188
00:23:36,125 --> 00:23:42,250
going to create a tunnel back
to, those of you who saw my
satellite talks will have seen I

189
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:48,250
did the same thing at the time
my kids weren't that old, and
the only TV in the house was

190
00:23:50,417 --> 00:23:54,833
connected to the satellite I was
hacking, so I hope I didn't scar
them for life, I'm not sure what

191
00:23:54,833 --> 00:24:01,500
time it was, but, you know, so.
-- Say again, oh, you've met my
son, and yes, I did, okay,

192
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:07,500
sorry. Okay, so. As I said in
the satellite one, sniff that
bitches. [Laughter] Okay. Bring

193
00:24:26,542 --> 00:24:32,542
up tunnel, oh, it's a good sign!
Okay. So we have a tunnel. [
Laughter ] [Applause] >> Demo

194
00:24:44,833 --> 00:24:50,833
gods, be good to me. What the
fuck's my password? [Laughter]
[Applause] Is that long enough?

195
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:15,208
Okay. So I'm logged in, this is
my box called Nighty and it's in
the attic in a building in

196
00:25:15,208 --> 00:25:21,208
Silverton just outside London,
and it's got a TV tuner and an
antenna. So what I will do is

197
00:25:23,708 --> 00:25:29,708
look for the service I'm going
to attack, which in this case is
Babestation. And it's in Tzap.

198
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Okay. So adult Babestation, so
the way it works is you need
that number, that's the channel

199
00:25:46,625 --> 00:25:52,625
number. So I'm going to run RV
download, this goes somewhere,
it goes somewhere pristine.

200
00:25:55,042 --> 00:26:01,042
Okay. I'm dyslexic. RV Download.
Okay. So you see the three
directories have appeared and if

201
00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:38,250
I look in services. We've got
our guy, and there's all our
files, so that program is

202
00:26:47,333 --> 00:26:54,875
pulling down all the MHEG
content, so what I can do now is
run another process locally

203
00:26:54,875 --> 00:27:00,875
which is going to use that as a
server to transmit the pron to
me so look away boys. You want

204
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:20,250
to be able to see this window
'cause some fun stuff is gonna
happen here. So RB browser,

205
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:26,250
remote. This guy. All right.
That's live. Okay? [Applause] >>
You're minutes away from having

206
00:27:37,958 --> 00:27:43,958
to run screaming from the room.
[Laughter] So press the red
button, we get a challenge. [

207
00:27:57,083 --> 00:28:03,083
Laughter ] Ah! Okay. So what I'm
going to do, I'm going to put
123456, and this guy has

208
00:28:15,125 --> 00:28:21,125
actually died. Dammit. Doesn't
matter how many times you test
these things. [ Laughter ] >>

209
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:38,500
Woo! >> For those that didn't
hear, he said, can't get it up?
Curse you! Happens to everyone,

210
00:28:47,125 --> 00:28:53,125
yeah. It may not be fatal. Okay.
The annoying thing is we should
be seeing a whole bunch of

211
00:29:10,792 --> 00:29:16,792
debuggers in this window, so
which we're not seeing. And I
have no idea why. Try moving out

212
00:29:26,708 --> 00:29:32,708
of temp. Okay. Audience
participation, now I was hoping
we weren't going to go there in

213
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:41,000
this one, so. [Applause] >> Pull
two -- no. Some things just
can't be unseen. >> Ahh! >>

214
00:29:58,708 --> 00:30:04,708
Whoever you are, I love you,
you're my new best friend! Well,
nearly except I'm still not, OK,

215
00:30:07,667 --> 00:30:14,250
screw this. Back to the slides.
We'll do another live one in a
second. It's a different

216
00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:20,250
technique but I have, as you --
so we'll skip over that, hang
on. We'll come back to that. [

217
00:30:37,542 --> 00:30:43,542
Laughter ] [Applause] >> Here's
what I prepared earlier. So same
deal, three windows. >> How

218
00:31:24,958 --> 00:31:30,958
about some porn music? No, I
think I'll pass on that one.
Okay. So yeah, as you saw, same

219
00:31:34,250 --> 00:31:40,250
deal, we're downloading the
stuff, here we have -- this is
what should have happened. Okay?

220
00:31:47,917 --> 00:31:53,917
And pay attention to the top
left-hand screen, or it's the
bottom screen, okay. So notice

221
00:32:01,542 --> 00:32:06,625
it's doing, the debuggers are
actually showing me what numbers
are being compared, so it

222
00:32:06,625 --> 00:32:12,625
compared integer 987862 which is
our challenge to 999999, okay,
so it just does that during its

223
00:32:15,208 --> 00:32:21,208
startup. I'm now going to type
in 123456. Oh my God! [Applause]
At this point, it crashed, of

224
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:48,667
course. But in a way that was
good, because it's prolonging
the whole experience! [Laughter]

225
00:32:48,667 --> 00:32:56,000
I've done like one line of code,
I've put one line of debugging
in and I've dialed into the, you

226
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:00,667
know, I've got into the system
and I started the process of
hacking into it, and who would

227
00:33:00,667 --> 00:33:05,708
have thought, after three
minutes on a porn channel, I'd
be feeling unsatisfied, it's,

228
00:33:05,708 --> 00:33:11,708
you know. So restart the
process, try again. So this time
our pin is 738461. Bam! [

229
00:33:39,542 --> 00:33:45,542
Laughter ] [Applause] >> Don't
look kids! [ Laughter ] That was
close! [ Laughter ] >> So the

230
00:33:58,792 --> 00:34:03,000
other thing, I thought well,
that's all very well but I don't
want to be watching high quality

231
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:09,000
content like that on my crappy
little screen, I want to be able
to do that from my TV, so don't

232
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:19,250
want to hack the TV but maybe I
can just use the PC to get me
the code and the, you know,

233
00:34:19,250 --> 00:34:25,250
watch it on the TV. So I wrote a
little script in Python. [
Laughter ] >> You tell it what

234
00:34:30,375 --> 00:34:36,375
channel you want, you tell it
the challenge, and you tell it
you want to do it over the air,

235
00:34:43,292 --> 00:34:48,750
so this is going to pull the
live stream, extract the sorts,
'cause they use a sort, hint

236
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:56,708
hint, for those that are gonna
have a go at this, so PIN for
that challenge is 299517.

237
00:34:56,708 --> 00:35:02,708
Incidentally, the debugging
process, for figuring out their
algorithm was maybe 2 more lines

238
00:35:07,667 --> 00:35:13,667
of code, so, you know. So we've
got the PIN. How am I doing?
Demo gods don't love me. Come

239
00:35:26,083 --> 00:35:32,083
on, next slide. Dear God! [
Laughter ] >> What the hell is
it even called these days?

240
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:10,500
Impress, isn't it? Die. [
Laughter ] >> Yeah. Let's try
that again. [ Laughter ] >>

241
00:36:26,792 --> 00:36:32,792
Okay. Let's try that one.
[Applause] >>Anyone remember the
PIN? [ Laughter ] >> 299. [

242
00:37:00,708 --> 00:37:06,708
Laughter ] >> Woohoo! [Applause]
>> Boobies! Stop. I'm trying,
I'm trying, honestly. [ Laughter

243
00:37:26,792 --> 00:37:32,792
] >> I love my job! [Laughter]
Okay. We have genuinely got a
major meltdown here, so... okay.

244
00:37:42,042 --> 00:37:48,042
So let's go back to live and see
if we can do TVX, why not? We've
got time. So TVX was a

245
00:37:53,917 --> 00:37:59,625
different, TelevisionX was a
completely different
proposition, because that guy

246
00:37:59,625 --> 00:38:05,792
was just so easy, I mean, it was
ridiculous, as I say, very
unsatisfactory. Television X,

247
00:38:05,792 --> 00:38:11,167
they appear to be doing some
actual real crypto, when I
started debugging it was like

248
00:38:11,167 --> 00:38:16,083
endless calls to a loop, doing
really complicated maths, I was
going round and round and round,

249
00:38:16,083 --> 00:38:21,958
and it took me a couple of hours
to think no, I'm not going down
this route, I'm just spending

250
00:38:21,958 --> 00:38:28,250
way too much time on this. There
must be an easier way. So if you
remember the process, the

251
00:38:28,250 --> 00:38:34,250
process is you download a stream
and the TV then interprets that
stream and it acts, it turns it

252
00:38:38,583 --> 00:38:43,500
into a program and it acts on
the program. Well, if what is
happening is the program is

253
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:47,917
saying I'm going to check this
PIN and I'm going to do all this
crypto and then I'm going to, if

254
00:38:47,917 --> 00:38:53,417
it's correct, I'm going to jump
to this page and if it's not
correct I'm going to jump to

255
00:38:53,417 --> 00:38:59,417
this page, how hard can it be,
right? So we have a startup file
pre-prepared which I've

256
00:39:09,958 --> 00:39:16,208
recompiled, I've decompiled,
changed the way the instruction
goes and then recompiled it, so

257
00:39:16,208 --> 00:39:22,208
we should be able to, assuming
nothing is running still, we're
going to look for . . . Still

258
00:39:50,167 --> 00:39:56,167
going. Okay. So just to make
sure it really is locked, we do
an RB. Oh God I'm an idiot,

259
00:40:02,375 --> 00:40:08,375
look, here but my debugger is
coming up in this window.
[Laughter] Okay. I'm a tool. So

260
00:40:15,292 --> 00:40:21,292
here we are, Television X live
and locked. So all I'm going to
do now is copy my startup poned

261
00:40:35,458 --> 00:40:41,458
to the services, 15 startup. So
I'm overwriting the existing one
and then go back to my browser,

262
00:40:56,167 --> 00:41:02,167
bam. [Applause] >> That's all
I've got. [Applause] So if
anyone dares to admit they have

263
00:41:32,167 --> 00:41:38,167
a question -- [ Laughter ] >> Q
and A mic, so not only do you
have to admit you have a

264
00:41:43,083 --> 00:41:48,917
question, you have to come and
stand in front of the whole
audience. No, I didn't think so,

265
00:41:48,917 --> 00:41:54,917
okay. Okay. Well that was it, it
was just a bit of fun, and I
thought it was fun, so thank

266
00:42:00,583 --> 00:42:05,667
you. [Applause]
