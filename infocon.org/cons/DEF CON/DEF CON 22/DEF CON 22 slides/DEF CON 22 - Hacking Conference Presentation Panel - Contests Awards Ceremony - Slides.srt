1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,958
>>We're the contest events
ceremony thank you, everyone to
be here. Give you several

2
00:00:04,958 --> 00:00:10,958
yourselves a  hand for being
here. We are really glad you
made it out. Glad you can see by

3
00:00:15,208 --> 00:00:20,750
how this is going to taking a
lot of effort to get this done.
And he has been doing it for the

4
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:26,125
last five years. Maybe two or
three should have been doing it
instead of just one. And really

5
00:00:26,125 --> 00:00:33,625
we found a  way to fuck it up.
Let's talk about the asshole
we're going to bring up on‑

6
00:00:33,625 --> 00:00:41,125
stage, he is running all of the
country test events for the past
five years. [ Applause ] >>

7
00:00:41,125 --> 00:00:47,750
Thank you, guys. Everybody
enjoyed Def Con 22, right? [
Applause ] I'm not going to let

8
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:53,458
cats out of the bag, but we have
very, very big surprises next
year. I'm stepping down from

9
00:00:53,458 --> 00:00:57,333
context events and villages.
Your friend, drifter will be
taken over villages, contests

10
00:00:57,333 --> 00:01:03,333
and events will be taken over by
the two have done it all of this
year. In fact, I have been super

11
00:01:08,375 --> 00:01:15,792
fucking lazy. I have been going
since Def Con 6. These guys have
been busting ass taking care of

12
00:01:15,792 --> 00:01:21,792
me. A  big hand for them. [
Applause ] Anyway, I'm going to
hand it back over to them. I

13
00:01:28,208 --> 00:01:34,208
want to thank you, all again for
your participation and coming
out and making Def Con 22 or

14
00:01:40,292 --> 00:01:46,292
special. You guys being involved
and participating, versus just
observing and taking place in

15
00:01:49,667 --> 00:01:55,667
the contests and events and
being part of what Def Con is,
is really what makes it special.

16
00:02:02,125 --> 00:02:08,125
So thank you. >> This awards
ceremony is officially started.
All right. We're going start

17
00:02:23,917 --> 00:02:29,292
with the scavenger hunt. Please
step forward real quick. [
Applause ] As they come up here,

18
00:02:29,292 --> 00:02:35,292
I want to let you guys know we
have random stuff from the
different contest as very visual

19
00:02:38,167 --> 00:02:46,042
part of Def Con. We have gong,
token ring, and rascals and
pirate ships and everything.

20
00:02:46,042 --> 00:02:52,042
This is a  great visual way to
enjoy Def Con. So without
further ado, scav hunt. [

21
00:02:54,833 --> 00:03:00,833
Applause ] >> I would like to
start off by saying I'm sorry.
But that would be a  lie. The

22
00:03:03,875 --> 00:03:09,250
savhunt, we had 152 items on the
list this year, plus a  floppy
disk full of extra challenges.

23
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:15,250
We had 40 teams sign‑ up and six
teams of heavy competitors and
we have T‑ shirts over there.

24
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:25,417
The  ‑ ‑ the  ‑ ‑ the race for
first and second was really
close. The race for third and

25
00:03:25,417 --> 00:03:30,667
fourth was really close. And it
came down to noon today with
people turning in their final

26
00:03:30,667 --> 00:03:36,667
items. So without further ado.
Oh, my team. I'm Salem. Mofoe,
Zohra, Hilda, Kay, and vuggy.

27
00:03:40,708 --> 00:03:46,708
Here are the winners. [ Applause
] >> So, fifth place, single
player, got 87 points. Single

28
00:03:50,167 --> 00:03:56,167
place  ‑ ‑ or, fifth place, but
single person. New to Def Con.
Fourth place, new to Def Con got

29
00:04:01,333 --> 00:04:07,333
98 points. [ Applause ] Third
place got can, was from Italy
and currently on a  plane to

30
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Italy. And they got 124 points.
[ Applause ] They're team,
Calvin & Hobbes. Second place,

31
00:04:22,708 --> 00:04:28,708
team Adam with 167 points. [
Applause ] You may know team
Adam as VZ9 for 9. And the

32
00:04:32,958 --> 00:04:38,958
winning team with a total of 214
points  ‑ ‑ Julian Assange great
victims. First, second, and

33
00:04:45,375 --> 00:04:51,375
third can come up and get their
shit! [ Applause ] Thank you. [
Applause ] >> All right. Well,

34
00:05:10,042 --> 00:05:16,583
that's a good way to start a 
ceremony. Get them rowdy and
crazy ones out of the way first.

35
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:21,875
All right. We're going to switch
gears a little bit to something
a little bit more serious since

36
00:05:21,875 --> 00:05:26,708
we got your attention and the
blood flowing. Every year for
the last six years we have been

37
00:05:26,708 --> 00:05:32,042
doing this thing called be the
Max. The partnership with the
American registry of bone

38
00:05:32,042 --> 00:05:38,042
marrow. People need bone marrow
transplants a lot of them. We
have a lot of white people doing

39
00:05:38,042 --> 00:05:44,292
registrations. We don't have a
lot of non white people. If you
are a  nonwhite person, we

40
00:05:44,292 --> 00:05:49,833
really, really need your
samples. Please keep that in
mind. We did want to mention a 

41
00:05:49,833 --> 00:05:56,292
couple of things of we got the
second best record this year for
sign‑ up, 112. The record was

42
00:05:56,292 --> 00:05:59,958
two years ago at 150. As of this
year, we were running with
exactly one match at Def Con

43
00:05:59,958 --> 00:06:05,958
because of this initiative. And
I got a‑ ‑ twitter message about
six months ago saying, hey, I

44
00:06:11,833 --> 00:06:16,500
saw you on‑ stage yelling at me
for not signing up. I signed up
next years. Six months later

45
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:22,125
someone called me and said I was
a  match, I saved an 8‑ year‑
old girl's life. So that is kind

46
00:06:22,125 --> 00:06:28,125
of big news. [ Applause ] So we
have exactly two of you that,
that made it happen and saved

47
00:06:34,583 --> 00:06:40,333
somebody's life because of this
initiative here. I definitely
would encourage everybody here

48
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:45,250
to check it out in the contest
area next year. It is very
simple, you fill out a  form, do

49
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:52,958
a  cotton swab. I'm being told
to drink, from the serious one.
Come on. >> What is the point.

50
00:06:52,958 --> 00:06:58,958
You are up there  ‑ ‑ >> There
you go. All right. So  ‑ ‑ oh,
geez, what the heck was that? [

51
00:07:02,167 --> 00:07:09,375
Laughter ] Any rate, it is, this
is  ‑ ‑ something that is very
easy to sign‑ up for, not like

52
00:07:09,375 --> 00:07:15,042
blood where you cannot swab if
you were drinking the night
before. They swab your cheek,

53
00:07:15,042 --> 00:07:20,042
and go on a merry way, and maybe
they will give you a  call in
six months or 12 years, but they

54
00:07:20,042 --> 00:07:25,917
might give you a  call. And the
big thing that people are
concerned about is transplant,

55
00:07:25,917 --> 00:07:33,542
paint and surgery. It is
outpatient it is four hours you
come in and do your things for

56
00:07:33,542 --> 00:07:40,500
four hours there are nice
couches and DVDs and then you
leave and your part is done.

57
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:45,833
Some parts of the transplants
you have a Charlie horse for a 
day. It doesn't hurt. It is not

58
00:07:45,833 --> 00:07:51,833
a  big deal. I have personally
done one myself. I can attest to
the fact you need to get here

59
00:07:54,500 --> 00:08:00,500
next year. Oh, thank you. I have
the gong thing, anyways. Moving
onto the next slide. [ Applause

60
00:08:03,375 --> 00:08:09,375
] All right. Thank you, guys.
All right. Mohawk, Mohawk, do
you want to come up here? Ed?

61
00:08:14,458 --> 00:08:20,458
Ed, calling Ed. Check in. >>
Hello. I'm Ed with Mohawk, how
are you guys doing? [ Applause ]

62
00:08:30,542 --> 00:08:36,792
Beer. All right. We did  ‑ ‑ I
don't see too many Mohawks in
here. Where are my Mohawks at

63
00:08:36,792 --> 00:08:42,792
some stand up? Yeah! Thank you.
[ Applause ] We actually tried
to do a  head count, we did 255

64
00:08:49,292 --> 00:08:55,292
Mohawks. We raised just for the
EFF$4,220.76. >> 420. >> 380 of
that was made just at the

65
00:09:04,208 --> 00:09:10,208
summit, and renderman raised
$455.76  of that. Hackers for
charity. $1,820, making a grand

66
00:09:15,625 --> 00:09:21,625
total of $6,040.76. [ Applause ]
Also  ‑ ‑ they have, any of you
guys are affiliated with hacker

67
00:09:27,083 --> 00:09:33,000
spaces we offer the capability
of getting free money from us.
Bring a  box to our booth next

68
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:38,917
year, you get free money. This
year the only one that showed up
was hack. They raised $213  for

69
00:09:38,917 --> 00:09:44,917
themselves. [ Applause ] Thank
you. >> All right. Next up. This
is a pretty fun little contest.

70
00:09:49,125 --> 00:09:53,958
And pretty good turnout, as far
as I'm aware. Up next is Def Con
box. Do we have anyone from Def

71
00:09:53,958 --> 00:10:00,500
Con box? Run, forest, run! So
Def Con box was around 2004‑
2008, we brought it back this

72
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:06,500
year and made it more software
oriented. Basically our
contestants had to make robots

73
00:10:19,583 --> 00:10:25,542
that shot lasers at moving
targets. It is as hard as it
sounds. The first place winner

74
00:10:25,542 --> 00:10:31,542
is TMX. Come on up, you don't
have to say anything. [ Applause
] So they have to build the

75
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:40,792
hardware, they have to do the
electronics and program it. It
is really complex. These guys

76
00:10:40,792 --> 00:10:47,208
did it and made it to the second
wave. We will be back next year,
similar contest. Come check out.

77
00:10:47,208 --> 00:10:53,208
Thank you. [ Applause ] >> All
right. Hackers against humanity.
If you didn't know this game is

78
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:05,750
a horrible game for horrible
people. These are the top three
worst people at Def Con. You

79
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:12,667
should not get within 100  feet
of these people. So we had a 
chrome cast game here, one of

80
00:11:12,667 --> 00:11:19,000
them was so pissed off at the
chrome cast failing, he changed
his name to chrome cast fail.

81
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:25,000
And we have decks of cards we
were selling raising money for
EFF. Yada, yada. I don't know

82
00:11:27,667 --> 00:11:33,667
what else to say about it. Are
the teams in the room? Okay.
There is one guy. Come on up. [

83
00:11:51,208 --> 00:11:57,208
Applause ] All right. Third
place gets this Atari 2600ET. [
Applause ] Yeah. And worst game

84
00:12:02,167 --> 00:12:07,042
ever. And we got first place up
here, second apparently, but
checked out for lunch. First

85
00:12:07,042 --> 00:12:13,042
place gets sneakers on laser
disk. [ Applause ] And first
place, first place we're going

86
00:12:17,042 --> 00:12:22,417
to in it to let you be a 
complete jerk at Def Con next
year, come see us for your free

87
00:12:22,417 --> 00:12:28,417
rascal rental for next year's
Def Con. All right. We had
TPCPIP drinking game this year.

88
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:37,750
This was asked to be brought
back by dark tangent. He bought
us a  keg of beer and only about

89
00:12:43,583 --> 00:12:48,625
13 people showed up. So 13
people had fun with the keg of
beer this year. The turns out 12

90
00:12:48,625 --> 00:12:52,917
of them had too much fun,
because the network contest
people won twice in a  row. The

91
00:12:52,917 --> 00:12:58,917
person that was up here
representing was actually on  ‑
‑ was actually just finished

92
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:10,333
writing a  book that is the new
Bible of TCPIP illustrated. He
was pretty well‑ versed and

93
00:13:10,333 --> 00:13:14,958
crushed everyone else. So thank
you to all of them.
Congratulations. [ Applause ]

94
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:20,958
All right. >> You call out the
one fucking mistake they make.
>> We have a  neck beard in the

95
00:13:31,833 --> 00:13:39,250
audience. Now, we have the pitch
my rascal guy cans. They can
come up. We only had one teach

96
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:46,292
entered this year. They happened
be the best fricken pitched out
rascal. It is a  pirate ship

97
00:13:46,292 --> 00:13:52,292
that launches marshmallows from
a  canon. Can we get a demo?
Let's see the canon. [ Applause

98
00:14:02,333 --> 00:14:07,292
] So you might have seen the
other rascal running around here
with the 1200 what sound system.

99
00:14:07,292 --> 00:14:12,208
That was the organizers of the
contest. They could not enter.
They don't win a  prize. They

100
00:14:12,208 --> 00:14:19,583
are just losers. So we have five
15  years old. All five of them
will get rascals paid for five

101
00:14:19,583 --> 00:14:25,583
days each next year at Def Con.
Thank you very much. Thank you
very much. [ Applause ] All

102
00:14:31,208 --> 00:14:34,875
right. We have to beverage
cooling contest people in the
house. Beverage cooling contest.

103
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:40,875
Come on forward. Double time. >>
So this year we have the tenth
annual beverage cooling

104
00:14:55,708 --> 00:15:01,708
contraction contest. It has been
going for 10 years. Awesome. And
we had three winners  ‑ ‑ any

105
00:15:04,042 --> 00:15:10,042
winners here? Team Hebrew. Team
ad  hoc  ‑ ‑ this man  ‑ ‑ has
the most winning and the most

106
00:15:15,083 --> 00:15:21,792
participating, except for many
team Hebrew in the history of
the thing. And  ‑ ‑ they might

107
00:15:21,792 --> 00:15:27,792
be on a  plane. This guy had the
coolest science, he forced CO2
into a  liquid state. It forced

108
00:15:30,708 --> 00:15:36,708
him three times to get the
right. But  ‑ ‑ it was really
neat. It was so hot out there, I

109
00:15:45,458 --> 00:15:51,458
gave them their prizes early and
we all had cold beers. [
Applause ] >> All right. And the

110
00:15:55,875 --> 00:15:59,333
true spirit of the hacker
conference. We could not go
without having the badge

111
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:05,333
contest. That's who is next.
Counterfeit badge contest. Come
on up. [ Applause ] >> Hi. I'm

112
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:33,500
arachus, this is kitty subursa.
This is the first year for a 
new contest. We had so many

113
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:40,042
people wanting to be part of it.
We had to modify the contest
rules a little bit to apply

114
00:16:40,042 --> 00:16:45,458
freeform entry. Folks wanted to
do human badges this year. We
said, okay we'll take it. We

115
00:16:45,458 --> 00:16:51,833
ended up having three different
badges that you could counter
fit  ‑ ‑ counterfeit and we had

116
00:16:51,833 --> 00:16:57,833
some amazing entries. >> So we
ended up getting one from each
of the categories that we ended

117
00:17:01,667 --> 00:17:07,667
up accepting. So that's urber,
the human, and the queer badge
and loss badge. We received

118
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:18,792
about eight entries, or nine,
I'm sorry. They were just above
and beyond our expectations. So

119
00:17:18,792 --> 00:17:25,625
it is really great for our first
year here. And I guess talk
about the winner? >> Yeah. First

120
00:17:25,625 --> 00:17:33,417
place was Emily. She ended up
doing the queer con  badge. See
if we can locate it. This is it.

121
00:17:33,417 --> 00:17:40,875
We have to photos up in the Def
Con forum. >> And  ‑ ‑ um,
second place we'll just do, go 

122
00:17:40,875 --> 00:17:47,208
‑ ‑ real quickly. Second place
we have Solomon with the human
badge. He did a  dental plaster

123
00:17:47,208 --> 00:17:53,208
mold and it looks fabulous as
well. And  ‑ ‑ [ Applause ] And
then third place we had Tyler

124
00:17:56,292 --> 00:18:02,292
and Brian with their version of
the lost badge from 19. I think
it was beautiful point pen on

125
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:10,250
vinyl, but it looked pretty damn
convincing. >> Unbelievable. >>
Thank you to those who

126
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:16,000
participants. >> And for the
prizes we don't have official
badges to give out. We have

127
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:22,625
counterfeit. Some of you have
may have seen this before. So,
to Emily, she will be getting

128
00:18:22,625 --> 00:18:28,625
the BC19 Über badge
counterfeited made out of real
titanium and perfect and for the

129
00:18:31,542 --> 00:18:37,542
runners up perfect clones of

you very much. [ Applause ] >>

130
00:18:44,292 --> 00:18:51,625
Okay. Up next  ‑ ‑ ah, good
friend of mine and just a 
really genuinely nice guy, every

131
00:18:51,625 --> 00:18:58,542
year for the past, what? Four or
five years? Six years, he has
donated his time and money that

132
00:18:58,542 --> 00:19:05,000
he makes from selling his art to
the electronic frontier
foundation. Eddie, like I said,

133
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:11,000
great man. [ Applause ] And  ‑ ‑
this year his contributions were
$4,100  to the EFF and $4,100 

134
00:19:15,417 --> 00:19:21,417
for charity. [ Applause ] So  ‑
‑ so we want to give a  big
thank you to Eddie. All right.

135
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:35,250
Next up do we have any from the
creative short story contest?
Chop‑ chop. >> Ah, so my name is

136
00:19:47,167 --> 00:19:52,417
Aarhus. Some of you know some,
some don't. If you don't know
me, you will, soon, I'm not the

137
00:19:52,417 --> 00:19:58,958
quietest person around. However,
my contest is in quiet. In the
second year, I took it over from

138
00:19:58,958 --> 00:20:04,292
Nikita, this is a creative
writing story. The only way to
enter is registered on the

139
00:20:04,292 --> 00:20:10,625
forum. It occurs on the forum at
Def Con. However that goes. The
prizes are entered to that

140
00:20:10,625 --> 00:20:17,708
year's Def Con. All that you
have to do is write a  short
story, make it good and to the

141
00:20:17,708 --> 00:20:25,458
team  ‑ ‑ theme. If I like it I
give you a  badge. Simple as
that. I would like to see more

142
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:31,833
of you do it. The people who won
this year, a  collaborative
effort, and they did an amazing

143
00:20:31,833 --> 00:20:39,250
story. Can you please stand up.
Todd and le‑ ‑ Lyra, there you
are. Come over. This is their

144
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:46,833
first time. They wrote together.
A  beautiful story and a
fantastic plot. We check for

145
00:20:46,833 --> 00:20:52,833
spelling and grammar and we
check that, too. We have free
badges that we give them

146
00:20:54,958 --> 00:21:00,958
Thursday. That could be you. So
go to the forums and join. Show
me your work. >> Thank you,

147
00:21:03,708 --> 00:21:11,625
Aarhus. All right. Next up we
have two contests that are sort
of mushed together because we

148
00:21:11,625 --> 00:21:16,083
didn't have a lot of floor space
here. Both cool and they had a
good turnout. So please come on

149
00:21:16,083 --> 00:21:22,083
up. [ Applause ] >> I'm
abstract. I decided that running
one contest apparently was too

150
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,792
boring. So I decided two. One is
a space paddle game played in
with sequel commands. And the

151
00:21:31,792 --> 00:21:36,583
other is a robot battle game
played with deaf coin. I wanted
to do something and Def coin

152
00:21:36,583 --> 00:21:42,583
this year. That was awesome. We
probably had one of the best
battles I have seen for the

153
00:21:47,333 --> 00:21:53,333
championship round. Two players
were working on their scripts
for months if not years battling

154
00:21:56,250 --> 00:22:02,250
each other. That was the topman
ended up being sis fix for the
win. He took home a  .5 Bitcoin.

155
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:11,750
Following him was oh, Mr. 
Glass. Oh, I got a  screen,
great. Mr.  Glass and

156
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:17,750
quicksilver, they played great.
All right, Mr.  Glass in here,
anyway, coin drives is awesome,

157
00:22:24,667 --> 00:22:31,583
35,000 transactions take place.
The Def coin network only has
70,000 transactions on it since

158
00:22:31,583 --> 00:22:37,583
April. So, we were pretty much
99% of that this weekend. And
for schema, we had 26  million

159
00:22:40,125 --> 00:22:44,292
events take place in the
database. So they are great
contests. If you would like to

160
00:22:44,292 --> 00:22:50,292
learn more, they run all year
round. Thank you,. [ Applause ]
>> All right. Now one of Def

161
00:22:55,792 --> 00:23:01,792
Con's mini capture the flag
context. Wireless CTF. Do we
have anyone from wireless CTF?

162
00:23:05,792 --> 00:23:11,792
Hustle up guys. Come on. >> Your
girlfriend didn't either. [
Applause ] All right. I'm Vic,

163
00:23:27,167 --> 00:23:33,167
and  ‑ ‑ myself are chaos, Rick,
Russ, Justin and where is dray
on, he gave us a lot of help,

164
00:23:36,375 --> 00:23:42,625
too, and put on the wireless
village. We had 25 speakers this
year 1/2 a  packed audience.

165
00:23:42,625 --> 00:23:48,500
Apologized to everyone who tried
to get in and couldn't. And to
those that we had to kick out

166
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:54,917
and holler at because you were
blocking a  thing. We have been
promised a larger space next

167
00:23:54,917 --> 00:24:02,417
year. We will see if they come
through. Here is Rick put
together one hell of a  contest.

168
00:24:02,417 --> 00:24:07,417
I'm going to let Rick talk about
that. >> So we had 17 teams
play. It was a  much more

169
00:24:07,417 --> 00:24:13,167
difficult contest this year than
last. The guys that came back
this year put together a  pretty

170
00:24:13,167 --> 00:24:18,375
all‑ star team, and called
themselves all cats. They did
amazing. Where are they? Stand

171
00:24:18,375 --> 00:24:24,250
up. They spent four days
breaking into all kinds of shit,
they got a ton of prizes. We

172
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:30,250
just want to thank you, guys for
playing as well as the rest of
the team. [ Applause ] >>

173
00:24:40,125 --> 00:24:45,875
Awesome. So this next contest as
we're waiting for them to get up
here, project Q. This is a

174
00:24:45,875 --> 00:24:51,417
unique one, because we squashed
them with another contest. This
guy does this really killer

175
00:24:51,417 --> 00:24:59,042
contest. This is really, hard,
nobody has ever won it. We had
how about you connect with

176
00:24:59,042 --> 00:25:04,250
project two. If that works out
and somebody can actually win
your contest, you guys might get

177
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:09,417
bigger and better prizes. So a 
bit of unique one, I will let
them talk more about it. Go

178
00:25:09,417 --> 00:25:15,417
ahead. >> Greetings. My name is
catatonic I'm with project two.
Of 82 teams of miserable fools

179
00:25:18,958 --> 00:25:25,125
and scumbags. Three teams were
most miserable and foolish.
Project two is proud to announce

180
00:25:25,125 --> 00:25:31,125
first place go to no hand
letters. Sorry you took third.
Second place was NA who did, I

181
00:25:36,625 --> 00:25:43,250
think he was actually a  split.
We put a team limit on our
teams. He was split off from our

182
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:48,542
winning team, which is the
autobits for which, yeah. Get
your asses up here. Fuck, I

183
00:25:48,542 --> 00:25:54,542
thought you guys were right
behind me. So we usually do not
so great prizes and these guys

184
00:25:57,125 --> 00:26:01,000
will probably be hungry. So I
got them a  box of cereal, but
there are five of them so they

185
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:07,000
will have to eat it in parallel.
[ Applause ] >> All right. Up
next we have one of my personal

186
00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:15,250
favorite contests. Because I
love this fucking game. Hack
fortress. It pits people playing

187
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:24,500
fortress against hackers. >>
Hello. How many guys have seen
us play hack fortress twosome

188
00:26:37,167 --> 00:26:41,208
hey. That's better. How many of
you guys have seen us play hack
fortress? It is really great. We

189
00:26:41,208 --> 00:26:47,250
have fortress two players going
and hackers going doing battles
back and forth. We're doing

190
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:53,250

No results reported. Anyone?
Real quick, crack me if you can.

193
00:27:09,917 --> 00:27:14,750
Password cracking contest. This

195
00:27:23,792 --> 00:27:29,792
Carnegie Mellon that came in.
They win $600  once they release
all of their write ups how they

196
00:27:32,542 --> 00:27:38,542
did it and their tools and that
we get all updated tools. [
Applause ] >> Thank you. Up next

197
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:47,292
we have a crash and compile.
Which is a  really, really cool
game that involves a lot of

198
00:27:47,292 --> 00:27:55,167
drinking and coding as well. >>
Real quick, why they are getting
up here. We did want to mention,

199
00:27:55,167 --> 00:28:01,167
this game they polished through
three kegs of beer playing this
game. >> Yeah. That's, that's

200
00:28:04,042 --> 00:28:10,042
why Def Con drinks the most. >>
All right. First place, broken Z
Dick's. They won favorite name

201
00:28:12,792 --> 00:28:18,792

Hacker jeopardy. They are, come

204
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:49,000

I'll keep it quick. We have 150
days submitted in our first

205
00:28:52,708 --> 00:28:59,333
contest. The main submitter was
Craig young from tripwire, but

206
00:28:59,333 --> 00:29:05,542
average business user Michael
Lucy, and chase Schultz
submitted zero dates that

207
00:29:05,542 --> 00:29:12,750
resulted in a  full router
compromise. Team burke won the
15,000 points and Craig cones

208
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:18,750
and team night watch. Come on
up. >> Hacker jeopardy. By the
way, does this look familiar? It

00:29:30,125 --> 00:29:36,125
says pack a  jar, what did he
do? Nobody knows the line? You
guys are pathetic. Yeah. He did.

210
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:45,417
Hey. Eric and Karen here, the

hacker jeopardy. We have a card

211
00:29:45,417 --> 00:29:53,083

it. We have results. >> We had
three decent games and one

212
00:29:53,083 --> 00:29:57,500
really shittying one. Taking a
WIKI leak was the only game to
make it to jeopardy. They won.

213
00:29:57,500 --> 00:30:03,125
Epier game two nicely done. We
for game three won it. But our
reigning champion. Win job, are

214
00:30:03,125 --> 00:30:09,125

year for qualifiers. We had only
40 teams that come down. So next

215
00:30:16,833 --> 00:30:22,833
year show your ass up, and until
then, don't fuck it up, don't
fuck it up, don't fuck it up. >>

216
00:30:27,167 --> 00:30:33,167
I think hacker jeopardy. Up next

217
00:30:36,042 --> 00:30:43,250
many people showed up to see
hacker pyramid? Thank you each
and every one of you. We counted

218
00:30:43,250 --> 00:30:48,042
98 the first night and 112 the
second night. You fucks. Had a
great year this year, technical

219
00:30:48,042 --> 00:30:54,042
problems. An incredible save on
the final night due to a  fan
blowing out on the server that

220
00:30:56,542 --> 00:31:02,542
was running the game. Picked up
the laptop  ‑ ‑ a  ‑ ‑ 40
something‑ year‑ old hacker

221
00:31:04,625 --> 00:31:10,625
woman grabbed a  bag of ice.
Shoved it underneath the laptop
and away you go. All of your 20‑

222
00:31:13,417 --> 00:31:19,417
year‑ old mother fucks, you got
beat by a  mother of five. [
Applause ] Yeah. Think about it.

223
00:31:22,833 --> 00:31:28,833
Our winners  ‑ ‑ rich mogul and 
‑ ‑ Mike from penmore. Come on
Mike. They won 100 Canadian

224
00:31:35,833 --> 00:31:42,083
dollars and 10,000 Def coins.
Because there is 10,000 in their
somewhere. We think it is

225
00:31:42,083 --> 00:31:48,542
because Mike is from Canada that
he was able to win. We think.
Second place was Dan, they got

226
00:31:48,542 --> 00:31:54,542
$20  in Canadian tire hundred  ‑
‑ money. And there is no third
place. Fuck off. [ Applause ] >>

227
00:31:57,083 --> 00:32:03,083
All right. Next up we have the

00:32:06,792 --> 00:32:13,500

234
00:32:54,292 --> 00:33:00,292
Anyone? Sorry  ‑ ‑ saved by the

year of the TDR film contest. We

235
00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:11,250
had seven teams sign‑ up and

238
00:33:28,292 --> 00:33:36,208

244
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:17,833
feel demoralized the last team
from 9:00 to 6:00  p.m. The

245
00:34:17,833 --> 00:34:23,833
place. They had to go. And the
second place was the electronic
Sames are. It is on the screen,

256
00:35:48,292 --> 00:35:54,000
forensic hacking techniques we
wrapped digital security in

257
00:35:54,000 --> 00:36:00,000
sign up for it, and pretty top
scores out of 7,000. The top
team is 12,230 from the Ukraine.

258
00:36:02,125 --> 00:36:08,667
And a team, pink pather 12,180.
They are actually on a  plane
back to South Korea. And tie

259
00:36:08,667 --> 00:36:14,667
2750. And team nol fourth and
Lucy at fifth. Deep competitors
along the way. This is what the

260
00:36:19,042 --> 00:36:23,417
challenge board looks like
zipping across here. If you are
there, see us in front. A  mini

261
00:36:23,417 --> 00:36:29,583
iPad for first place. A  laptop
for second, and a Samsung tablet
for third. Hope to see you next

262
00:36:29,583 --> 00:36:35,583
year at Def Con 23. >> All
right. Next up we have zapping
Rachel. Come up. >> Hi, I'm

263
00:36:41,750 --> 00:36:47,750
Carol with the Federal Trade
Commission. Thank you for having
us here doing the zappal Rachel

264
00:36:54,250 --> 00:36:59,667
condition. We had only 100
registers and we have
prizewinners who are eligible to

265
00:36:59,667 --> 00:37:06,042
$17,000 in prices. They will
help us despite the discourage
of Rachel and robocalls. So

266
00:37:06,042 --> 00:37:14,000
thank you for phase I of the
honey pot challenge, the high
score was night hawk. For phase

267
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:20,000
II attacker robo call
circumvention center. The
highest score was Jean and for

268
00:37:22,167 --> 00:37:28,167
phase III. We had terrific end
violence. We are three hi,
scores here. A  data analytic

269
00:37:32,542 --> 00:37:40,417
challenge, extremely close. The
participant who scores 3rd was
dark typhoon. The participant

270
00:37:40,417 --> 00:37:46,625
who was second highest was Shaun
beck. And the high score was
violent snowstorm. So winners we

271
00:37:46,625 --> 00:37:52,625
will be in touch and thank you
all. Congratulations. [ Applause
] >> So I know they were really

272
00:37:54,708 --> 00:38:01,500
pressed and wanted to rush and
get it done. I'm happy about
that. However, zapping Rachel,

273
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:07,500
who is Rachel. This is a robo
call context. The FTC called us
up and were like the FTC wants

274
00:38:10,042 --> 00:38:15,500
to do a contest. So we had to do
a  background check to verify
that everyone from the FTC

275
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:23,167
wanted to do this. And what is
your contest. You know how
somebody cops you, ( Speaking

276
00:38:23,167 --> 00:38:29,167
foreign language ) and they are
like, no. I don't speak spanning
and you are robo calling me from

277
00:38:31,375 --> 00:38:37,708
Mexico. They are like, yeah. We
get 80% of our complaints that
comes into the FTC is that

278
00:38:37,708 --> 00:38:43,292
stupid robo call thing. What if
we can come to the hacker
community and say can you help

279
00:38:43,292 --> 00:38:48,333
us crack the nut and get the
problem solved. Apparently you
guys did a great start moving

280
00:38:48,333 --> 00:38:54,917
forward. If I'm not mistaken, we
will be doing it again next
year. We're on the fence on it.

281
00:38:54,917 --> 00:39:00,292
A way would love you to have it
come back next year and continue
that moving forward. If you guys

282
00:39:00,292 --> 00:39:03,625
really, really hate the robo
calls this is the contest you
want to do. Thanks. [ Applause ]

283
00:39:03,625 --> 00:39:09,625
>> All right. Next up we have
hacker war games. Hacker war
games. Here we go. >> Hello.

284
00:39:17,458 --> 00:39:22,875
This is cutune. This is the
second year I have done this.
Most people don't know about it.

285
00:39:22,875 --> 00:39:27,833
It is a  tactical warfare game
can, using real handguns.
Running a  course trying to

286
00:39:27,833 --> 00:39:34,833
shoot targets it is on the DC
area, it is before Def Con. I
have several different classes

287
00:39:34,833 --> 00:39:40,458
but the only real classes that
were winning were the one shot
snipe shot, a really hard shot,

288
00:39:40,458 --> 00:39:47,708
and nuclear Steve won that. So
he won bags and then the
standard handgun shot, that Dr. 

289
00:39:47,708 --> 00:39:54,875
Tron, he is back in Los Angeles.
And then seize got the long
rifle gun competition, which he

290
00:39:54,875 --> 00:40:02,167
got almost a  perfect score. So
that's pretty much it. [
Applause ] >> All right. And

291
00:40:02,167 --> 00:40:07,875
last, but certainly not least.
The Def Con shoot. Do we have
someone from Def Con shoot that

292
00:40:07,875 --> 00:40:12,667
wants to speak? Okay. Well, the
shotgun in the desert. Good fun.
That's all that we have for you.

293
00:40:12,667 --> 00:40:18,667
I would like to thank you all
for attending this year. We had
really great contest. We

294
00:40:22,250 --> 00:40:27,625
appreciate when you guys
participant. The only thing that
is left is the closing

295
00:40:27,625 --> 00:40:35,292
ceremonies in tract 1. Be there
or don't. Track two. Excuse me.
Closing ceremonies track 2.

296
00:40:35,292 --> 00:40:41,042
Thank you. [ Applause ] >>
Whoever borrowed this is from,
please come up so I can give it

297
00:40:41,042 --> 00:40:43,042
back to you. >> All right.
Everybody sitting in the
sections near the exits. We are

298
00:40:43,042 --> 00:40:45,042
going to seat the black badge
contestants in this section by
the exits. Yes. The section

299
00:40:45,042 --> 00:40:47,042
closest to the doors. So if you
would like to stay for closing
ceremonies, which who wouldn't,

300
00:40:47,042 --> 00:40:49,042
please move into the center
section or to the other side
because only black badge

301
00:40:49,042 --> 00:40:51,042
contestants are going to be in
this section. Now, if you are a 
black badge contestant, guess

302
00:40:51,042 --> 00:40:53,042
what I'm going to say next? All
right. Everybody out. Yeah. Yes.
This room is going to be empty.

303
00:40:53,042 --> 00:40:55,042
So  ‑ ‑ >> He doesn't know what
he is talking about. Oh, really?
>> All right. Ladies and

304
00:40:55,042 --> 00:40:57,042
gentlemen I have two things to
do. Number one if your near the
back wall, get away from it,

305
00:40:57,042 --> 00:40:59,042
they are going to break it for
closing ceremonies. Number two,
if you in the section closest to

306
00:40:59,042 --> 00:41:01,042
the doors sitting there. Come to
the next section over, closer to
me, we need to reserve that for

307
00:41:01,042 --> 00:41:03,042
black badge winners and contest
winners. Those people closest to
the doors come towards me, or

308
00:41:03,042 --> 00:41:05,042
get the hell out of the doors if
you want to go. I don't care. If
you're next to the wall, get the

309
00:41:05,042 --> 00:41:07,042
hell away from the wall, come
into the room. If I go by the
wall and go like this, and I

310
00:41:07,042 --> 00:41:09,042
touch somebody, I will
immediately slug them with my
fist of doom. So stay away from

311
00:41:09,042 --> 00:41:11,042
the wall and come away from the
doors. Okay? Come away from the
doors. Come away from the walls.

312
00:41:11,042 --> 00:41:13,042
This ain't hard. We have already
screwed stuff up. >> The option
is, if you don't do that  ‑ ‑

313
00:41:13,042 --> 00:41:15,042
they're going to make us vacate
the room. >> Yeah. >> So be
nice.
