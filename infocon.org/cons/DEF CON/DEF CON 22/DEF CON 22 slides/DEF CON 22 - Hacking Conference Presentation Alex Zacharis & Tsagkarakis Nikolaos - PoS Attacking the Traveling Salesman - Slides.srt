1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
This is Alex and Micos and I had
to practice like 10 times.
Speaking about point of sale

2
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:24,542
vulnerabilities specifically in
places that the TSA won't like
so be nice to them because

3
00:00:24,542 --> 00:00:30,542
they're probably stuck here.
Gentleman. >> Hello. Thank you.
Thank you for the introduction.

4
00:00:34,125 --> 00:00:40,125
We're going to present a case
study of an attack of POS that
takes place in an airport. This

5
00:00:53,167 --> 00:00:59,167
is a real airport but we're not
going to disclose the name. So,
our presentation and now I give

6
00:01:09,208 --> 00:01:15,208
this to Mr. Alex. >> So, we're
going to discuss about specially
involved POS attacks but before

7
00:01:25,833 --> 00:01:32,708
we talk about that let's discuss
about why they choose to target
travelers. So travelers are

8
00:01:32,708 --> 00:01:39,500
really vulnerable people.
They're running around trying to
catch a flight and they don't

9
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:47,208
think about what kind of
wireless access they use or what
especially if they trust the

10
00:01:47,208 --> 00:01:54,583
place in which they're using
let's say an airport. It's
supposed to be a place very

11
00:01:54,583 --> 00:02:00,583
trustworthy. So you have a
number of travelers running
around, causing many devices and

12
00:02:04,542 --> 00:02:11,083
trying to juggle around trying
to catch a flight and he guards
his mobile phone, laptop,

13
00:02:11,083 --> 00:02:17,083
tablet, maybe his corporate
mail. I know most of you think
that's not a secret service guy

14
00:02:25,458 --> 00:02:31,458
so we're talking about these
guys, too So let's get a little
better closeup look at the point

15
00:02:37,625 --> 00:02:43,625
of sale attack interpretation.
It's a little bit different than
usual, what we usually know

16
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:52,250
about POS attacks where we
target credit card details. In
our case we're trying to

17
00:02:56,458 --> 00:03:02,875
identify the traveler so we're
looking about the names, the
traveler, his flight number, his

18
00:03:02,875 --> 00:03:08,875
seat, who is he communicating
and the worst case we're trying
to get passport ID so we're

19
00:03:11,083 --> 00:03:17,083
talking about this stuff and not
credit cards which is usually
what happens in POS attacks. So

20
00:03:19,625 --> 00:03:26,750
let's go through the ways
usually the point of sale attack
is introduced. There are three

21
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:32,750
ways. We're talking about the
first one in our case but I'll
go through all three of them. So

22
00:03:35,292 --> 00:03:42,000
the first thing is when a system
has unpatched vulnerabilities
someone might find out and

23
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,667
expose the whole system and get
the information he needs out of
the system The second way is

24
00:03:47,667 --> 00:03:55,167
maybe an employee of a company
which is not aware of how things
work about security, send mail,

25
00:03:55,167 --> 00:04:00,833
a link or whatever and
introduces a trojan in the
company's network and it reaches

26
00:04:00,833 --> 00:04:06,958
the point of sale system so
that's where you get the
information from. Or the third

27
00:04:06,958 --> 00:04:12,958
way is that the employee himself
is the bad guy, the inside man
that produces the malware in

28
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:22,500
order to harm. So first of all
who is going to benefit from
this? Okay. Well, there are

29
00:04:25,208 --> 00:04:31,292
three but maybe more but I'm
quoting three there, Cyber
criminals, usually for identity

30
00:04:31,292 --> 00:04:37,875
theft in the case of passwords
and stuff. Private investigators
who just want to find you, or

31
00:04:37,875 --> 00:04:43,875
maybe the government if they
want to find you. What do you
get out of a point of sale

32
00:04:46,583 --> 00:04:52,583
attack. As I said before we're
trying to provide the traveler,
we don't get airport data to do

33
00:04:56,208 --> 00:05:02,208
so, we do it on our own so what
we can achieve is like at the
end of getting information is

34
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:11,250
that we can find out the
designation and perform queries
like who's traveling from Greece

35
00:05:13,292 --> 00:05:17,750
to Germany in the last month, or
which company is used by most
travelers or what class were

36
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:23,750
these travelers traveling? Or on
a specific flight and date who
was traveling. So here's the

37
00:05:43,083 --> 00:05:46,625
case study now. We're talking
about the real airport and this
really happened. So the airport

38
00:05:46,625 --> 00:05:51,958
has different systems that can
be exploited the way we're
describing here in order to see

39
00:05:51,958 --> 00:05:57,958
information. So we have the
check-in kiosks which probably
you've all used before. There

40
00:06:03,167 --> 00:06:10,000
are some systems that we have
exploited but you can purchase
wi‑fi time and have other

41
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:16,000
information but usually you can
find in many airports. Also we
can find internet access points

42
00:06:18,042 --> 00:06:24,042
and all of them hold information
that could be found useful by us
attackers, in order to exploit

43
00:06:27,083 --> 00:06:33,083
the traveler. Let's get some
more information about the
airport, how big is the attack

44
00:06:36,042 --> 00:06:42,042
vector that we're dealing with
and how much the people are
affected. These are from the

45
00:06:44,917 --> 00:06:50,917
specific airport, we're talking
about an average of 12 million
travelers per year of whom

46
00:06:54,500 --> 00:07:00,500
30 percent as you can see these
are from 2012. 30% are business
passengers which are really more

47
00:07:06,542 --> 00:07:12,542
interesting to attack or learn
more about them. The first two
numbers are real but the last

48
00:07:14,625 --> 00:07:20,625
one is the hypothesis that says
100% of them are using the POS
system. 36,000 people can be

49
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:28,708
attacked per year. Seems small
but it isn't that small. So ‑‑
>> No, keep going. >> Okay. I'll

50
00:07:37,458 --> 00:07:43,458
continue. So we chose to attack
this, it seemed better than the
rest, seemed to have less

51
00:07:56,167 --> 00:08:02,167
security, it's supposed to even
buy wi‑fi time in order to
default. Change back you can

52
00:08:06,167 --> 00:08:12,167
check your flight details by
scanning your ticket and you can
also make VOIP calls,it has a

53
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:23,250
web cam in it, and there were
six machines in there. >> Excuse
me for a second. May I take the

54
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:29,250
podium for a quick second? >> So
we have a first time speaker,
and for those of you who are not

55
00:08:32,583 --> 00:08:39,500
familiar, for a first time
speaker. [Applause] >> We have a
little bit of a welcome

56
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:45,500
tradition here and unfortunately
we don't have any vodka. But
yeah, next time >> You guys are

57
00:08:54,042 --> 00:09:00,042
from Greece? >> We got the wrong
information. [Applause] >> Yeah.
[Laughing] >> A little bit of

58
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:22,000
support. Here. Are you good? >>
I'm better now. >> Would you
like some help? >> No, no.

59
00:09:29,458 --> 00:09:36,042
[Applause] >> Thank you guys. So
I'll give the slide from the
beginning because I'm drunk now.

60
00:09:36,042 --> 00:09:42,042
So wi‑fi, you can buy wi‑fi
time, they accept coins and
bills and they give you change

61
00:09:46,708 --> 00:09:54,417
back. You can take your flight
scanning your bar code on your
ticket and you can make VOIP

62
00:09:54,417 --> 00:10:00,417
calls on them. There are six
perfectly placed around the
airport so what better things to

63
00:10:03,917 --> 00:10:09,917
attack? So let's go a little bit
more. On them there's a screen
of the wi‑fi interface, this is

64
00:10:13,667 --> 00:10:19,667
for the VOIP calls and this is
the simplest attack you can do
on them, press alt tab and

65
00:10:24,167 --> 00:10:30,167
escape the front end also yes
the thing didn't work from the
left but it worked from the

66
00:10:37,542 --> 00:10:43,542
right. So, but it's not the
worst thing. They also had the
USB port open. So you can

67
00:10:50,125 --> 00:10:56,125
understand what's going on here.
>> Excuse me. It was clearly
visible when you went in

68
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:06,458
upstairs from arrivals to
departures so when you get
upstairs via the automated

69
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:12,458
stairs you can clearly ‑‑ >> You
are like oh ‑‑ [Laughing] >> So,
so, okay. After going on a bit

70
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:20,500
more about the system we show
that the escape used Windows 7,
they had a connect because of

71
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:25,000
the protocols, it was getting
worse and worse, because if you
hit escape button there were

72
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:31,000
processes running in the
background they were giving you
full control of the system so

73
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:50,500
they were running in the
background. So you sent some
money, which we did without

74
00:11:55,542 --> 00:12:03,292
using the machine we clicked how
much we want and we said pay and
you know slot machines you've

75
00:12:03,292 --> 00:12:09,292
seen are worse than, I mean
they're harder to get money.
This is real easy. So okay some

76
00:12:12,708 --> 00:12:19,042
more victims here. The
communication with the process
behind the front end is talking

77
00:12:19,042 --> 00:12:26,417
to the back end. This makes
sense. It's in Greek but I will
explain. This is how much money

78
00:12:26,417 --> 00:12:32,417
is in there. Around 500 in
Europe are missing and the good
thing we find how much money we

79
00:12:35,208 --> 00:12:41,208
want to get out of them. Where
you can see down there is you
just pick how much money you

80
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:49,500
want and there's a pay button in
the middle. Get the money out of
the system. So you want to talk

81
00:12:54,250 --> 00:13:00,250
about how we ‑‑ >> So why this
happen? This happens because
we're using the airport to go

82
00:13:05,083 --> 00:13:11,083
around the world working the
security industry so when this
was found we decide to inform

83
00:13:13,583 --> 00:13:20,333
the airport because its not only
the risk of losing money at the
airport, it's also things an

84
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:26,333
attacker can do with these type
of skills so we decided to call
the airport. When we called the

85
00:13:29,625 --> 00:13:35,625
airport they didn't believe us.
They said no, there's no way.
And then we called again. And it

86
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:43,750
was one week time before they
sent people to check it. After
one week they called us back and

87
00:13:46,583 --> 00:13:52,792
told us you are lying, this is
not possible to happen because
we checked and it is not

88
00:13:52,792 --> 00:13:58,792
happening. We insisted, we said
no it's happened. They said come
here. So we went there, showed

89
00:14:04,167 --> 00:14:10,167
them the bug. So after a while
they decided to fix the alt tab
issue and then we decided to see

90
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:22,250
who can do further stuff
regarding the point of sale at
the airport and everywhere else

91
00:14:25,083 --> 00:14:31,083
but we did more testing after
they fixed the alt tab there's
still a possibility to have

92
00:14:34,167 --> 00:14:36,167
access from the Skype interface
that locates your flight. They
do a fork from Skype and

93
00:14:36,167 --> 00:14:42,167
internet explorer from where you
can see your flight status and
when your flight arrives. Then

94
00:14:44,833 --> 00:14:50,833
you can get access to XML and
then you can get access to
whatever you want from there you

95
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:05,250
can download whatever malware
you want also internet explorer
is an old version, so it's

96
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:11,250
probably exploitable. We can't
show you this stuff because it's
highly illegal. [Laughing] >> So

97
00:15:15,667 --> 00:15:21,667
this, we found these extra bugs
and the other was the bar code.
So you have a lot of point of

98
00:15:31,042 --> 00:15:37,042
sales, you have this infrared
scanner and from there they pass
product bar codes, they send

99
00:15:42,792 --> 00:15:50,583
information back to the machines
so we decided to build an
application that would generate

100
00:15:50,583 --> 00:15:56,583
not so random bar codes or QR
codes to applications Here you
can see the interface, you can

101
00:16:02,333 --> 00:16:08,333
see that there's a map showing
the flag if you point there then
it opens up a Gmail account to

102
00:16:12,625 --> 00:16:18,625
the mail to send to look in and
use Google Maps for the
information. It will be exposed

103
00:16:27,375 --> 00:16:33,375
again after they are fixed okay
so you can have the pay option.
>> It was a really bad

104
00:16:36,042 --> 00:16:42,042
application. The service we've
seen before. This black screen.
This one. If you close this

105
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:57,333
window the call service went
down so they executed something
like CNV cell and then it will

106
00:17:02,292 --> 00:17:08,292
run the application something
like that. Whenever you scan the
code there the code was

107
00:17:10,875 --> 00:17:18,750
displayed in this console okay?
So that's one of the things you
can take information from the

108
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:23,833
bar code. We will see the maps
and we will go to the mail
account information. Here can

109
00:17:23,833 --> 00:17:29,833
you pay yourself, and so we
found that it was very
interesting, they also have web

110
00:17:43,125 --> 00:17:50,167
cams in it. So if you own this
part of the network you can
possibly monitor all of the

111
00:17:50,167 --> 00:17:56,333
cameras in these machines so can
you take pictures of all of the
passengers passing by. These

112
00:17:56,333 --> 00:18:02,458
were placed in important places
inside the airport so you can
have a very good view of the

113
00:18:02,458 --> 00:18:08,458
passengers going in or out. They
then, the malware must have RAM
scrapping capabilities so they

114
00:18:13,417 --> 00:18:19,417
can take the information from
RAM of the machine. And the fast
way will be able to pass the

115
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:30,625
infrared in the interface and
cause more errors. So here's the
camera, we're having issues

116
00:18:30,625 --> 00:18:36,625
because we cannot see the image
here. The functionality of the
kiosk- so whenever you went to

117
00:18:59,958 --> 00:19:06,792
buy wireless time, you had the
ability to get flight
information so you scan your

118
00:19:06,792 --> 00:19:12,792
boarding pass, the QR code in
the boarding pass and then
comparing it back with the web

119
00:19:16,458 --> 00:19:22,458
service, the flight if it's in
time or your information if it's
valid. That means that kiosk has

120
00:19:24,583 --> 00:19:30,583
access to a service to confirm
passengers, if it turns back the
flight information everything is

121
00:19:34,917 --> 00:19:40,917
valid. Or if there is a
possibility for the application.
Also there's a possibility to do

122
00:19:46,708 --> 00:19:52,708
net reports, to Skype, to
wherever we go. From what we saw
it was possible to access

123
00:19:56,958 --> 00:20:02,958
whatever you wanted on the
internet from that kiosk so I
will tell you later and he will

124
00:20:06,917 --> 00:20:12,917
continue with the possible risks
posed. >> So this talks more
about the code. Your tickets, a

125
00:20:18,792 --> 00:20:24,792
bar coded boarding pass. It was
a bar code introduced by the
International Air Travel

126
00:20:28,667 --> 00:20:34,667
Association in 2005 and more
than 200 airlines use them, and
some of them have a mobile

127
00:20:36,792 --> 00:20:42,792
version. What we saw is that the
more common is the PDF417 and
for the digital type its Aztec

128
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:57,792
code or Datamatrix and QR code
because we couldn't extract all
of them we decided to do one

129
00:20:57,792 --> 00:21:03,792
from paper and one from digital
we talk about and prove our
things in real life from the

130
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:15,250
tool that we've developed So
information about PDF417. The
linear bar code we say use in

131
00:21:22,042 --> 00:21:28,708
transportation identification
and inventory management, and
what ticket looks like inside is

132
00:21:28,708 --> 00:21:34,708
like this, this is a QR code
PDF417 code that I scanned from
aerial ticket and it belongs to

133
00:21:37,458 --> 00:21:43,458
me and there's information
inside it. You can see the data
under the QR code, under the bar

134
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:51,750
code and I have broken down the
information of each feed so you
can see my name, my slide, my

135
00:21:54,958 --> 00:22:02,167
booking, where I'm sitting and
from where I booked the ticket
and which airline I'm using,

136
00:22:02,167 --> 00:22:09,125
passenger seat, everything is
there. So you know everything
about my flight. Also can you

137
00:22:09,125 --> 00:22:16,958
see if I am business class or
what type of, first class or
what class I'm flying. Also

138
00:22:16,958 --> 00:22:23,083
again, without the code here
we're talking about digital
version of the same thing, it's

139
00:22:23,083 --> 00:22:28,708
usually present in mobile phones
and handheld devices where you
can see the eticket version of

140
00:22:28,708 --> 00:22:34,708
that. You can see the standards,
you can see again that it has
less information of the previous

141
00:22:38,292 --> 00:22:44,417
one but again the code has lots
of stuff thats useful to get out
of a machine, so here is the

142
00:22:44,417 --> 00:22:51,750
attack vector all in the machine
that we previously showed, we
can do the following: We will

143
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:57,750
have a traveler going to kiosk
scanning his ticket. We have
malware on that kiosk, the point

144
00:22:59,875 --> 00:23:06,167
of sale malware that we're going
to discuss later about more. it
has RAM scrapping capabilities

145
00:23:06,167 --> 00:23:12,708
so whatever is in its RAM its
ours, we're going to do is we
can display that information and

146
00:23:12,708 --> 00:23:17,167
maybe clone the ticket if we
want, so we can get through tax
free area and get some alcohol.

147
00:23:17,167 --> 00:23:23,167
So, okay, two things that are
here, the first one is that we
need malware to do these and

148
00:23:31,583 --> 00:23:37,833
then we need an application to
do the duplication or other
stuff that we'll explain later.

149
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:43,833
The malware must have full
capabilities as most malware
must have, and perform the RAM

150
00:23:46,083 --> 00:23:53,542
scrapping that we talked about
before in order to get every
ticket that was scanned before.

151
00:23:53,542 --> 00:23:59,542
And what else, maybe exploited
the webcam and get some picture
of a guy scanning so we know who

152
00:24:02,292 --> 00:24:08,292
he is, and of course to do so
you have to hook the barcode
scanner so you can synchronize

153
00:24:11,833 --> 00:24:19,042
the picture taking otherwise
you're taking random pictures
and may have the ability of

154
00:24:19,042 --> 00:24:25,042
getting commands through a QR
code so it would thus scan a
specific QR code and get money

155
00:24:29,583 --> 00:24:36,542
out of the machine because we
can do that. And of course it
would be great if you could have

156
00:24:36,542 --> 00:24:42,542
the connect back process. even
if you didn't have that we could
give commands to the QR code

157
00:24:45,625 --> 00:24:51,625
again so it's fine So we would
go through the, yes, so the
image capturing is harder than

158
00:25:00,875 --> 00:25:08,542
you think, because we have to
hook and synchronize with the
code, scanner with the camera

159
00:25:08,542 --> 00:25:14,542
and it's not that easy because
the RAM scrapping thing works
asynchronous, it runs like every

160
00:25:19,167 --> 00:25:25,167
two hours and gets all the
information so you have to just
have them in place and then

161
00:25:27,542 --> 00:25:34,708
combine them to see who was
scanning on a specific time it
has some drawbacks so most of

162
00:25:34,708 --> 00:25:40,208
them will have to do with
timing, correlating images with
travelers data, and of course

163
00:25:40,208 --> 00:25:47,542
when you create files inside the
system you might get noticed
easier than without doing so. so

164
00:25:47,542 --> 00:25:53,542
its mostly detectable but you
can actually do that. I believe
the most interesting part and

165
00:25:56,333 --> 00:26:01,042
it's what characterizes this
attack as a point of sales
attack. its the RAM scrapping

166
00:26:01,042 --> 00:26:08,458
feat, so you have 3 things you
do in the point of sales attack.
You extract the RAM of the

167
00:26:08,458 --> 00:26:15,500
process that you want, probably
the bar code scanner. Also it's
interesting to attack the

168
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:21,500
explorer process and you should
do it periodically around every
two hours maybe because it's a

169
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:29,417
time consuming process so you
can do it every 5 seconds and
the second thing you do is you

170
00:26:29,417 --> 00:26:35,958
search, you search for the
string thats interesting, in our
case the QR code with your

171
00:26:35,958 --> 00:26:42,125
traveler's information so with
the code inside RAM so you are
looking for specific values

172
00:26:42,125 --> 00:26:47,875
which are fixed sizes, specific
values, which are specific in
our case, using regular

173
00:26:47,875 --> 00:26:52,333
expressions you get the
information. Sometimes youll
have false positives but get

174
00:26:52,333 --> 00:27:00,250
them too because you can you
know clear things later, and you
store them and the third thing

175
00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:06,792
is the exfiltration, it's a bit
harder because if you have
connectivity it will send back

176
00:27:06,792 --> 00:27:14,667
to you try not to get caught.
And if not you just store them
locally and you go there

177
00:27:14,667 --> 00:27:20,458
physically and send a command to
the QR code and it brings back
all of the information you

178
00:27:20,458 --> 00:27:27,583
needed. You get them by some,
you know maybe scan them again
or write them down or whatever.

179
00:27:27,583 --> 00:27:33,583
But you know how it looks when
you do it thru volatility
dumping a the process, get the

180
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:42,000
information, this is from a real
machine. And a real process
scanning a ticket and you

181
00:27:49,208 --> 00:27:56,542
discard what's not useful and
you get what you want out of the
machine and the third thing that

182
00:27:56,542 --> 00:28:02,542
we want our malware to do is get
command from aztec code so you
scan a specific QR code and then

183
00:28:07,333 --> 00:28:15,250
do stuff like example turn on
and off the image capturing or
exfiltrate a specific thing, or

184
00:28:15,250 --> 00:28:20,708
maybe send someone a few
commands if you wanted to so
that's another thing we want our

185
00:28:20,708 --> 00:28:27,333
malware to do So we have on the
one end we have the malware
standing by on the machine that

186
00:28:27,333 --> 00:28:32,292
we hack, and then we have
another tool, that's a
multipurpose tool. Can you use

187
00:28:32,292 --> 00:28:39,917
that tool in order to do two or
three stuff. I'll explain. It
works again, it's on android

188
00:28:39,917 --> 00:28:45,917
mobile, you will get that
material after the conference,
it has 3 modes, it supports

189
00:28:48,250 --> 00:28:54,250
PDF417 and Aztec code, and it
has 3 modes the one is in order
to duplicate stolen tickets. And

190
00:28:57,875 --> 00:29:03,875
the second the PenTest one is
the most interesting mode is
fuzzing the barcode and I will

191
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:18,000
explain later. And you could use
all your favorite commands that
you can store in the text file

192
00:29:20,125 --> 00:29:23,208
and load to our fuzzer, ill
explain later and attack the
barcode and the malware command

193
00:29:23,208 --> 00:29:27,583
mode where you would send from
to the barcode to the malware
installed from the kiosk, so the

194
00:29:27,583 --> 00:29:33,583
duplicator looks like this and
we use it for impersonation
reason. so you want to create

195
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:42,000
the ticket that, like this so
you input their information and
you just create another ticket

196
00:29:45,167 --> 00:29:51,250
then you go to the check you
show your ticket, it's valid,
it's from another guy. Try not

197
00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:58,667
to use a woman's ticket if you
are a guy and probably you will
go through that first check and

198
00:29:58,667 --> 00:30:04,667
get that free booze, more
information about the fuzzing.
For the fuzzing we 4 kinds of

199
00:30:08,542 --> 00:30:15,458
fuzzing, we have string,
integer, random string,
predefined, you have all the SQL

200
00:30:15,458 --> 00:30:21,458
and XSS on there. It won't
actually work in other systems
but it work and crash other

201
00:30:24,417 --> 00:30:30,333
systems so it's pretty useful.
You should try that download
application and do your own

202
00:30:30,333 --> 00:30:36,333
research if you want. and hgow
the fuzzing works, you just down
there is the ticket you had. You

203
00:30:41,333 --> 00:30:47,958
just place where you want the
files to be and then you start.
It generates bar codes every

204
00:30:47,958 --> 00:30:55,542
five seconds. You can set your
own intervals because the QR
code reader different intervals

205
00:30:55,542 --> 00:31:01,542
depending on that you are
attacking this has generated QR
codes attacking the QR code

206
00:31:03,708 --> 00:31:10,125
reader. You can stop it at any
time copy the code and use it
later and then stop it and go

207
00:31:10,125 --> 00:31:16,125
one by one in your own pace in
order to test the system better.
So, and the last one is the

208
00:31:19,792 --> 00:31:25,917
commands to talk about. So you
can choose what commands you
want to send. You actually send

209
00:31:25,917 --> 00:31:31,917
dump RAM commands and you can
perform network scans so you can
actually set on and off the

210
00:31:36,417 --> 00:31:40,792
image capturing thing or you can
cash out money depending on the
command you want to send the way

211
00:31:40,792 --> 00:31:48,667
you do it is you click the
command, the command is enabled
through mobile application, the

212
00:31:48,667 --> 00:31:53,500
malware is running on the
machine you want and I'm sending
lets say the last scanned person

213
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:59,500
command and the malware responds
back with a pop up window this
is the guy this is hie picture

214
00:32:07,458 --> 00:32:13,458
this is the data. So closing
what you should do and what you
should not do or what you should

215
00:32:15,667 --> 00:32:22,417
do, especially for those
manufacturing jobs like this.
You should use strong passwords

216
00:32:22,417 --> 00:32:28,500
to access the point of sales
devices. You should keep your
point of sales software up to

217
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:34,333
date. This is the most important
thing. You should not use buggy
software. You should firewalls

218
00:32:34,333 --> 00:32:41,958
to isolate the point of sales
production networks from other
networks on the internet and

219
00:32:41,958 --> 00:32:49,833
it's a good idea to have an
antivirus there not that it will
identify all malware running but

220
00:32:49,833 --> 00:32:55,000
probably some would. Use limit
access to the internet if
possible and disable all remote

221
00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:01,750
access to the point of sales
system and one good idea is to
check both the hardware and the

222
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:07,208
software running from the kiosk
and not separately. You should
check them as a whole. This is

223
00:33:07,208 --> 00:33:12,458
very important. if you want to
identify more and more attack
vectors for the system and keep

224
00:33:12,458 --> 00:33:18,458
it secure so this is all from
me. I don't have ‑‑ you want to
talk more about? >> Yes.

225
00:33:22,917 --> 00:33:28,917
Furthermore, just to other
point, you have a lot of uhm in
all the airport alot of kiosks

226
00:33:32,625 --> 00:33:38,625
like that provide free internet
access or they give you some
functionality to have in the

227
00:33:41,667 --> 00:33:47,667
airport to play games or Skype
talk with your girlfriend and do
stuff like that. If you can

228
00:33:51,833 --> 00:33:57,833
imagine, if the attacker can own
these machines which are on the
same network how much time it

229
00:34:00,708 --> 00:34:06,708
will need to get deeper into the
airport network okay because
it's not a fact that you can

230
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:18,708
just attack all the passengers
or the machine surf the internet
who put the credit cards. It's

231
00:34:18,708 --> 00:34:24,708
not only that. It's the fact
that having an attacker being
there for the infinite time,

232
00:34:28,917 --> 00:34:35,625
that means there will be a case
that people go deeper into their
network, that means a real

233
00:34:35,625 --> 00:34:43,125
threat to the airport.
Furthermore, we have another
room next to us here where they

234
00:34:43,125 --> 00:34:49,250
are developing router exploits
at the moment so I don't know if
the router thats on the file is

235
00:34:49,250 --> 00:34:55,250
not enough so the best solution
for these kind of problems if
you have in a network, kiosks

236
00:34:58,458 --> 00:35:04,458
that provide user services, the
best solution is have physically
have different internet lines

237
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:13,875
different equipment for this
type of information from the
airport. >> Furthermore I would

238
00:35:13,875 --> 00:35:19,875
like to point out that although
this attack seems random it can
get more specific and more

239
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:30,375
personal if you want. using a
little bit of social engineering
So from what you see here it's

240
00:35:30,375 --> 00:35:34,292
like okay, I would like to say
you are attacking a random
strangers that are traveling but

241
00:35:34,292 --> 00:35:38,875
you are not liking this specific
person that you want to get
information from, well if it's

242
00:35:38,875 --> 00:35:46,250
not true if you get some social
engineering in that, since you
own the machine And most of the

243
00:35:46,250 --> 00:35:53,417
people traveling would probably
think its a safe machine to use
and we can run anything on that.

244
00:35:53,417 --> 00:35:58,542
I could run a campaign like a
phishing campaign on that
machine and then go around to a

245
00:35:58,542 --> 00:36:03,833
line of people awaiting to get
their ticket, one of them is the
guy that I want to attack. And I

246
00:36:03,833 --> 00:36:10,625
will be like oh sir, you are
traveling? Here is a QRcode you
can use that on that machine and

247
00:36:10,625 --> 00:36:16,625
maybe get free wi‑fi. All you
have to do is scan this code and
your ticket and you will get

248
00:36:21,958 --> 00:36:29,792
free wi‑fi. Even worse I would
be like you get some free money
>> 50 bucks. >> So he would be

249
00:36:29,792 --> 00:36:35,792
like "oh cool guy" but I get
information. Yes it seems random
but it's not that random if you

250
00:36:38,375 --> 00:36:45,292
own the machine and people trust
the machine. You can get them to
use a machine you can get that

251
00:36:45,292 --> 00:36:51,958
machine to work for you in your
favor and you will get what you
want. It's not at random. It

252
00:36:51,958 --> 00:36:57,958
seems random but it's not.
That's all from us. Do you have
any questions? [Applause]
