1
00:00:00,042 --> 00:00:06,042
>>Hello, everybody. Good
morning. DEF CON. We'll go ahead
and get started so hold onto

2
00:00:08,125 --> 00:00:12,583
your seat, all right. 	>> Thank
you so much for joining us at
such an ungodly hour. Does

3
00:00:12,583 --> 00:00:19,000
anybody have a headache, cuz we
can write you something for
this. 	>> It's good to see you

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,958
all here, one of the problems
with the Con, if you can call it
a problem, is it's hard to

5
00:00:22,958 --> 00:00:28,000
choose between all the awesome
tracks and awesome talks offered
at the same time so this morning

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,583
is no exception. And as you
know, there's a bunch of killer
presentations being given right

7
00:00:33,583 --> 00:00:37,833
now by some incredibly talented
researchers and I would
encourage all of you go check

8
00:00:37,833 --> 00:00:42,625
those out after they are posted.
	>> We are sincerely grateful
you have chosen to come start

9
00:00:42,625 --> 00:00:48,583
your morning with us so proper
introductions. 	>> My name is
Christian DeMeth, please call me

10
00:00:48,583 --> 00:00:54,708
"Quaddi", I'm an emergency
medicine physician early on in
my training, and I am also a DEF

11
00:00:54,708 --> 00:01:00,708
CON aficionado, this is my 10th
year, I love some capture the
flag and It's just like a second

12
00:01:05,583 --> 00:01:13,167
home for me here. 	>> I'm Jeff
Tully, pediatrician, vaccines
don't cause autism so pass that

13
00:01:13,167 --> 00:01:19,000
around! [Cheers and applause]
	>> I'm Peter Hefley I work for
Sunera, IT consultant and I have

14
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:25,000
seen several episodes of "House
MD." So a standard legal
boilerplate, this talk is not

15
00:01:27,167 --> 00:01:31,417
sponsored, endorse or affiliated
with any of our respective
professional institutions or

16
00:01:31,417 --> 00:01:36,292
companies. No unethical or
illegal practices were used in
the researching, acquiring or

17
00:01:36,292 --> 00:01:40,500
presenting of the information
contained in this talk. All
girls you are going to see are

18
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:46,500
consenting adults over the age
of 18. (Laughter) 	>> That was
good. (Laughter) 	>>Do not

19
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:53,708
attempt any of the theoretical
or practical tact concepts we
talk about in this presentation.

20
00:01:53,708 --> 00:01:59,583
We promise you will go to jail
and it will not have a fun time
in jail. 	>> One last thing I

21
00:01:59,583 --> 00:02:03,125
want to make sure we emphasize,
we've done a lot of work to
learn a great deal about how the

22
00:02:03,125 --> 00:02:08,875
911 system works and we have had
some really unique opportunities
to explore behind the scenes but

23
00:02:08,875 --> 00:02:14,333
we're certainly claiming to be
world experts in 911. The 911
systems in our country have such

24
00:02:14,333 --> 00:02:20,792
varying implementations. The
tacts we talk about, may or may
not apply to all of them and

25
00:02:20,792 --> 00:02:26,708
most certainly may not apply
abroad. 	>> Just the last little
bit of disclaimer here. We will

26
00:02:26,708 --> 00:02:34,292
play two audio recordings of 911
calls. They are rather
disturbing. If you are sensitive

27
00:02:34,292 --> 00:02:41,458
to that kind of stuff, maybe go
check out another talk or just
plug your ears. >> With that in

28
00:02:41,458 --> 00:02:45,250
mind, I'm sure many of you guys
are wondering what the hell are
these clowns doing up here? What

29
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:51,833
do we know about 911? This
actually starts four years ago,
Jeff and I began working on

30
00:02:51,833 --> 00:02:56,875
medical research involving the
free hospital, specifically at a
hospital with cardiac arrest and

31
00:02:56,875 --> 00:03:02,250
how 911 dispatchers teach people
how to do CPR over the phone.
It's a life saving intervention

32
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:09,500
What that meant at the end of
the day is that we have listened
to thousands of 911 recordings.

33
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:13,667
	>> As we listened to a
multitude including where dozens
which technical issues prevented

34
00:03:13,667 --> 00:03:18,750
the dispatcher from immediately
identifying the location thus
delaying medical response we

35
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:25,000
realized we knew nothing about
the technical infrastructure
behind 911. This is just a slide

36
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:31,708
of some of the papers we
actually ended up publishing
about dispatching 911. 	>>

37
00:03:31,708 --> 00:03:35,292
Furthermore after listening to
some of these calls where there
are technical limitations, we

38
00:03:35,292 --> 00:03:39,333
really wanted to dive really
deeper and see how, what are the
security measures really being

39
00:03:39,333 --> 00:03:43,917
put in place here to prevent use
of this system. 	>> Little
background. My wife went to

40
00:03:43,917 --> 00:03:49,042
school with these two, we became
great friends we play DND, we
drink beer together, as someone

41
00:03:49,042 --> 00:03:53,333
not behind the scenes from a
medical perspective I was
fascinated when they would talk

42
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:58,625
about this because this is one
of those things we take for
granted. When do you think the

43
00:03:58,625 --> 00:04:02,583
last time these emergency
response centers conducted any
type of risk assessment or

44
00:04:02,583 --> 00:04:06,625
vulnerability scans against
their systems. 	>> That's kinda
how we got together and thought

45
00:04:06,625 --> 00:04:13,458
this is something we should
probably research formally. 	>>
This actually is a result of

46
00:04:13,458 --> 00:04:17,917
that. We are gunna talk a little
bit about an outline here and
start with why you are all here,

47
00:04:17,917 --> 00:04:25,167
why this talk really matters.
	>> Then we'll go over a 30,000
foot view of how these systems

48
00:04:25,167 --> 00:04:29,792
are designed to work and then
talk about the research methods
and avenues we were able to

49
00:04:29,792 --> 00:04:35,583
explore. 	>> Then we'll hit
attacks we feel emphasize
particular points about where

50
00:04:35,583 --> 00:04:40,708
these systems are most
vulnerable. 	>> Then we hope to
loop it back to people. Our

51
00:04:40,708 --> 00:04:45,167
patients, your family members,
your friends. Because that's how
we came into all of this. Let's

52
00:04:45,167 --> 00:04:50,792
start with an example why this
stuff matters. 	>> This is going
to be a call recording of a

53
00:04:50,792 --> 00:04:58,708
rather disturbing 911 call. Just
be prepared. >> 911 Emergency.
Help me my husband has fallen he

54
00:04:58,708 --> 00:05:04,708
is holding his chest and I don't
know what to do please come! I
need your address ma'am Okay oh

55
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:15,250
um I live at 1375 Orange Street,
I think he is still breathing
but ya'll need to hurry it is

56
00:05:19,792 --> 00:05:27,667
bad. 1375 Orange Street Yes
ma'm, please hurry he is holding
his chest Emergency personnel

57
00:05:27,667 --> 00:05:33,667
will be over as soon as possible
Oh my god, Hurry, hurry oh
please thank you, thank you,

58
00:05:37,167 --> 00:05:42,000
please hurry! 	>> Little
sobering there. We also thought
about incorporating a laugh

59
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,875
track so you guys don't get
particularly depressed. 	That is
how the 991 system is supposed

60
00:05:47,875 --> 00:05:55,083
to work, quick, address, get out
on the gate and get someone
help. This is the subsequent

61
00:05:55,083 --> 00:06:00,292
call that caller calls back a
few minutes later. And this is
the recording. 	>> 911 Emergency

62
00:06:00,292 --> 00:06:08,125
	Oh my god where are you guys
at! He is on the floor he has
turned blue he is dying oh my

63
00:06:08,125 --> 00:06:15,208
god where are you guys at!? He
is not breathing anymore I do
not know what to do please help

64
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:21,583
me please help me! 	Okay ma'am,
I'm going to call the paramedics
right now 	Just hold on, please

65
00:06:21,583 --> 00:06:27,292
don't go please don't go honey
	Ma'am I'm having difficulty
finding your house 	What? I live

66
00:06:27,292 --> 00:06:31,875
at 1375 Orange Street
	Paramedics are at the
intersection of Palm and Orange

67
00:06:31,875 --> 00:06:37,583
Street 	Where? 	Intersection of
Palm and Orange Street 	Oh my
god that's too far. Please hurry

68
00:06:37,583 --> 00:06:44,958
please hurry I don't know what
to do he has stoped breathing he
is blue please help mne! 	>> So

69
00:06:44,958 --> 00:06:48,958
yeah definitely pretty heavy
stuff and thankfully most of the
time the emergency medical

70
00:06:48,958 --> 00:06:55,875
system works really well to
respond to serious situations
like that call. 	>> There is a

71
00:06:55,875 --> 00:07:00,458
lot that goes into this response
and a lot we rely on in an
emergency. If my heart were to

72
00:07:00,458 --> 00:07:06,458
stop right now, I would hope one
of you would call 911. 	>> And
do CPR 	>> Then hopefully you

73
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:15,125
would call 911 on your network
phone here and that call would
be carried by a wired or

74
00:07:15,125 --> 00:07:20,792
wireless provider to a dispatch
center where people with
freakishly unnatural zen-like

75
00:07:20,792 --> 00:07:27,958
calm necessary respond. 	>> Then
they'll relay that information
to firefighters and paramedics

76
00:07:27,958 --> 00:07:31,250
on the fire engines who will
take you for definitive
treatment. 	>> If this is done

77
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:38,375
in a timely enough process you
are hopefully you get to the
hospital through this door and

78
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:43,875
not through this one. Exactly
how does this system work and is
it as secure, effective, and

79
00:07:43,875 --> 00:07:48,292
safe as it could be and are
these questions even worth
asking? We thought so. 	>> We

80
00:07:48,292 --> 00:07:54,625
began with a couple goals when
we began to explore this field.
We wanted to understand the

81
00:07:54,625 --> 00:07:58,667
components of this system,
better identifiers of
vulnerability and also get a

82
00:07:58,667 --> 00:08:01,542
better idea of some of the
attacks that have happened
before as well as some of the

83
00:08:01,542 --> 00:08:06,042
solutions that were implemented
in their aftermath 	>> Finally
we wanted to see if research

84
00:08:06,042 --> 00:08:10,250
would lead to any ideas for
solutions to problems that
haven't been addressed yet. 	>>

85
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:15,042
We'll talk about the future of
911, how understanding future
state can help us identify

86
00:08:15,042 --> 00:08:18,583
potential weakness, attacks and
solutions for the system's next
evolution. 	>> So research.

87
00:08:18,583 --> 00:08:24,583
We've been saying that a lot.
What does it mean in this case?
As you can imagine it's not easy

88
00:08:27,667 --> 00:08:32,833
to walk into a dispatch center
or server room and ask to take a
look around. One of the main

89
00:08:32,833 --> 00:08:37,542
things we hope to convey is how
difficult it can be to get the
conversation started with people

90
00:08:37,542 --> 00:08:42,708
in charge of these systems. The
only advantage we had in our
prior research is we had a lot

91
00:08:42,708 --> 00:08:48,250
of contacts within the 911
system. We had a little bit of
access to these systems that

92
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:53,667
other people may not. 	>> We'll
keep those partners anonymous
but we did have a number of

93
00:08:53,667 --> 00:08:58,250
doors open that allow for ways
to collect information that
we'll share with you today from

94
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:03,667
in-person interviews to process
observations, to regional
surveys. 	>> And as you can

95
00:09:03,667 --> 00:09:10,292
imagine experimentation on a
live 911 system can be a little
dicey if you are not careful.

96
00:09:10,292 --> 00:09:13,458
	>> We'll tell you about
examples of how we messed around
with the system without getting

97
00:09:13,458 --> 00:09:19,125
in too much trouble. 	>>
Persistent element that has
continued through all this and

98
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:23,333
will hopefully continue through
the future of our research is a
development of solutions that

99
00:09:23,333 --> 00:09:28,083
will enhance and strengthen this
infrastructure. 	>> Without any
further ado let's get to our

100
00:09:28,083 --> 00:09:34,792
30,000 foot view. Start by how
the structure currently operates
with the simple example, wired

101
00:09:34,792 --> 00:09:39,833
telephone call. 	>> Here an
individual will pick up their
telephone or home phone and dial

102
00:09:39,833 --> 00:09:46,667
911. The call reaches the end
office by the telco provider at
which point the telco attaches

103
00:09:46,667 --> 00:09:52,875
subscriber information onto the
call, specifically automatic
number identification or ANI,

104
00:09:52,875 --> 00:09:57,375
this functional tags the
subscriber's billing telephone
number onto the call at which

105
00:09:57,375 --> 00:10:03,083
point the voice call and
unlimited amount of data, or
ANI, are pushed forward. 	>>

106
00:10:03,083 --> 00:10:08,375
Recognizing this is an emergency
call the end office will send
that call to the selected router

107
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:13,875
over dedicated emergency call
trunks. Selective router's
function in e 911 or enhanced

108
00:10:13,875 --> 00:10:18,542
911 is to route the call to an
appropriate basing point, that
is the PSAP, public service

109
00:10:18,542 --> 00:10:24,542
answering point, PSAP. That's
routing based on the ANI with
the routing that it maintains.

110
00:10:28,083 --> 00:10:32,292
If for some reason the call
comes in without information or
the ANI is corrupted router

111
00:10:32,292 --> 00:10:37,917
sends the call to a designated
PSAP based on default route,
much in the way routers we are

112
00:10:37,917 --> 00:10:43,292
all familiar with work. 	>> When
the selective router sends this
call tagged with information on

113
00:10:43,292 --> 00:10:49,042
to the PSAP it does so over a
dedicated trunk, ISDM line or
POTs line . Once the call

114
00:10:49,042 --> 00:10:53,750
reaches the PSAP dispatcher will
answer the call. Frequently
assisted by a computer-aided

115
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:59,000
dispatching system or CAD
System. It's really important at
this point the dispatcher be

116
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,917
able to accurately determine two
things, first is where is the
caller located? We need to know

117
00:11:03,917 --> 00:11:08,667
this so they need to dispatch
responses to the appropriate
location. Second thing is what

118
00:11:08,667 --> 00:11:14,500
public services actually service
that address or that location?
Is it county, fire, city police,

119
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:19,708
and a local ambulance company?
	>> To get this information
quickly PSAP, usually through a

120
00:11:19,708 --> 00:11:26,292
CAD, does a lookup against a
database. PSAP will send the
caller's ANI information and in

121
00:11:26,292 --> 00:11:30,958
response an automatic location
record back. This information
and the database that it is

122
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:36,958
stored are maintained by a
for-profit 3rd part. You pick up
the phone, dial 911 Comcast

123
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:44,875
sends emergency call and
selective details to that
selective router which then

124
00:11:44,875 --> 00:11:50,000
sends your call to the
dispatcher or PSAP and you hear,
911, what is your emergency?"

125
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:56,125
All the while your location is
being determined in the
background by the database. 	>>

126
00:11:56,125 --> 00:12:01,833
Things get more complex when the
caller can move around. In the
case of cell phones. Have you

127
00:12:01,833 --> 00:12:07,458
ever called 911 when you are not
at home? Maybe at out of state
on vacation? How is it that your

128
00:12:07,458 --> 00:12:11,875
call is answered by a PSAP that
is close to your physical
location and not billing

129
00:12:11,875 --> 00:12:19,458
address? How does that work?
Well the answer truly varies and
it depends on the implementation

130
00:12:19,458 --> 00:12:24,958
of e 911 standards based on the
physical location. One is called
wireless phase 1 as in the older

131
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:31,750
version, little bit less
accurate, and then wireless
phase 2. Which is what is being

132
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:37,042
rolled out around this nation
right now. 	>> Starting out by
talking through phase 1 which is

133
00:12:37,042 --> 00:12:42,458
displayed here, when you make a
cell phone call, your call
reaches a cell tower maintained

134
00:12:42,458 --> 00:12:47,792
by a provider. In phase 1
scenario that call is passed by
the tower to a mobile switching

135
00:12:47,792 --> 00:12:52,625
center which starts the
bifurcation of location data and
voice call. You can think of

136
00:12:52,625 --> 00:12:57,667
this as location information
flowing along the bottom in
yellow and the call flowing in

137
00:12:57,667 --> 00:13:01,542
red over familiar
infrastructure. To the selective
router and then along to the

138
00:13:01,542 --> 00:13:06,875
PSAP. 	>> In phase 1 your
location is approximated based
on the cell tower you are using.

139
00:13:06,875 --> 00:13:12,417
That location and sector or
phase of the tower handling the
call. So the mobile switching

140
00:13:12,417 --> 00:13:17,000
center will send a cell tower
location, cell tower sector
handling the call and a

141
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:23,208
call-back number to or CBM a
mobile positioning system which,
this is complex, it provides you

142
00:13:23,208 --> 00:13:30,542
a token called the emergency
services routeing K, ESRK or
psudo ANI or PANI. It provides

143
00:13:30,542 --> 00:13:36,292
the same function as the ANI on
the hardwired telephone call.
Just a little token then used to

144
00:13:36,292 --> 00:13:43,125
tag the call to the selective
router and then on to the PSAP.
	>> In this scenario the

145
00:13:43,125 --> 00:13:47,083
selective router looks up the
appropriate PSAP because you
don't want to be sent to a

146
00:13:47,083 --> 00:13:53,250
dispatch center not close to you
or send the right strike
package. In this situation that

147
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:58,583
is based on mapping between the
cell tower face and appropriate
PSAP. On the bottom you can see

148
00:13:58,583 --> 00:14:04,083
the mobile positioning center
forces the CVN, cell tower
location and cell tower sector

149
00:14:04,083 --> 00:14:10,292
into a temporary ALI record and
that's referenced by the ESRK or
Psudeoani PANI. This way when

150
00:14:10,292 --> 00:14:14,625
the PSAP does a lookup of the
location based on the PANI, they
receive the information in the

151
00:14:14,625 --> 00:14:19,667
computer dispatch. All this is
done seamlessly and
automatically. 	>> This is what

152
00:14:19,667 --> 00:14:25,625
the CAD is going to show the
dispatcher. You have your
callback number up top, next is

153
00:14:25,625 --> 00:14:31,625
the emergency services number or
identifying number. Then we have
the wireless carrier name, cell

154
00:14:31,625 --> 00:14:37,833
tower location, PSAP name, the
Call type, carrier that we have
our little temporary ESRK or

155
00:14:37,833 --> 00:14:43,250
PANI and location. If this were
a real lookup you'd also see an
emergency services strike

156
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:48,042
package which basically tells
you what police, fire and
ambulance providers will end up

157
00:14:48,042 --> 00:14:54,167
servicing in that location. 	>>
Wireless pahse 2 is an
enhancement, allows the PSAP to

158
00:14:54,167 --> 00:14:59,500
locate wireless callers and cell
providers positioning
determination equipment seen

159
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:03,750
here in the lower left. It's
important to understand this is
an abstraction and

160
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:08,125
implementation is left up to the
cell telephone provider, this
allows provider to implement

161
00:15:08,125 --> 00:15:13,542
whatever technology they want to
determine caller location. This
could obtain -- be obtaining GPS

162
00:15:13,542 --> 00:15:19,542
data, signal triangulation, both
or some other technology. The
delta between a phase 1 and a

163
00:15:22,042 --> 00:15:28,250
phase 2 call for 911 is that at
the actual caller's location as
opposed to a guess based on cell

164
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:34,083
tower location and sector is
passed along to the ALI
database. When the mobile

165
00:15:34,083 --> 00:15:38,583
positioning sensor gets the
initial data for a call to
include the call tower or cell

166
00:15:38,583 --> 00:15:44,583
tower, tower sector and callback
number it queries the position
determination equipment to

167
00:15:44,583 --> 00:15:51,167
determine where the caller is
at. That data is inserted as a
temporary ALI record and is

168
00:15:51,167 --> 00:15:56,542
provided to the PSAP when they
request it. This allows the PSAP
to best direct emergency

169
00:15:56,542 --> 00:16:00,083
responses to the correct
location. In these
implementations it is also

170
00:16:00,083 --> 00:16:05,042
common to see a mapping system
integrated, with the computer
dispatch system, that pulls up

171
00:16:05,042 --> 00:16:13,000
the caller's location on a map.
	>> Here you can see the ALI
data provided back from a phase

172
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,875
2 system. Major change is you
can see the caller's location
data as latitude and longitude.

173
00:16:17,875 --> 00:16:24,542
Incredibly important in urban or
rural centers where you might
not be at a physical location,

174
00:16:24,542 --> 00:16:31,125
you may be in an alley or in a
place that is not with a
physical address. Positioning

175
00:16:31,125 --> 00:16:37,542
system provides a level of
confidence in a percentage and
certainty in units of distance

176
00:16:37,542 --> 00:16:43,708
based on the mechanism it uses
to determine location. 	So to
recap on wireless calls, you

177
00:16:43,708 --> 00:16:49,167
call 911 on the cell phone, your
voice call is sent by wireless
provider to the PSAP through the

178
00:16:49,167 --> 00:16:53,750
intermediaries that we talked
about, specifically selective
routers. All the while your

179
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:59,833
location is being determined
either by cell tower
triangulation, just cell tower

180
00:16:59,833 --> 00:17:07,125
sector which would be in phase 1
or using your chip in your GPS
chip in your phone. That all

181
00:17:07,125 --> 00:17:11,625
gets put into a database and
sent to the PSAP who then has
your voice, call stream and

182
00:17:11,625 --> 00:17:16,875
estimated locations so they can
send folks your way. 	>> The
last thing we'll talk about as

183
00:17:16,875 --> 00:17:22,500
far as call flows goes is using
voice over IP or VOIP. We all
know about VoIP that reach the

184
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:27,250
residential market like Magic
Jack or Vonage. In these
scenarios the VO IP service

185
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:30,958
provider will maintain a
database of information that
links subscribers to the

186
00:17:30,958 --> 00:17:36,542
appropriate PSAP by location.
This is information that they
frequently compile and recompile

187
00:17:36,542 --> 00:17:42,042
based on the subscriber's
billing address. 	>> When VOIP
caller places a 911, their VOIP

188
00:17:42,042 --> 00:17:47,125
service provider passes that
call to an emergency services
gateway which passes the

189
00:17:47,125 --> 00:17:52,333
callback number or subscriber
information on to the VSP
database and obtains the

190
00:17:52,333 --> 00:17:58,000
appropriate PSAP and emergency
services query key, just like an
PANI just called something

191
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:03,417
different, just that token. From
there the call flows very
similar to what we discussed.

192
00:18:03,417 --> 00:18:07,625
The call is forwarded on to the
selective routers into the
appropriate PSAP who get's

193
00:18:07,625 --> 00:18:14,542
caller's location. Based on the
temporary record the VSP has
created with the subscriber's

194
00:18:14,542 --> 00:18:21,750
location and callback number.
	>> If that all wasn't enough,
this is not where this process

195
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:26,917
ends. So in any of the possible
scenarios we talked about,
whether it be wired, wireless or

196
00:18:26,917 --> 00:18:31,375
VoIP you still have to get the
information from the caller to
the dispatcher and the

197
00:18:31,375 --> 00:18:36,417
dispatcher has to initiate
appropriate response from the
strike package from the ALI data

198
00:18:36,417 --> 00:18:42,958
and then they must actually call
contact those units and get them
dispatched. Plans, fire engines

199
00:18:42,958 --> 00:18:49,292
and patrol cars will arrive on
scene, render help and if
necessary transport. When an

200
00:18:49,292 --> 00:18:55,625
ambulance is used to transport a
person in need to a hospital,
there is another communication

201
00:18:55,625 --> 00:18:59,250
line that occurs most often
cellular in which they will call
that receiving center,

202
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:04,875
communicate a few pertinent
details and then get acceptance
or refusal from this receiving

203
00:19:04,875 --> 00:19:08,750
center on whether or not they
can take the patient. 	>> All
right. So we have given you a

204
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:13,583
pretty good overview. How we'll
talk about ways to take
advantage of the system. Before

205
00:19:13,583 --> 00:19:17,500
we do that we thought it might
be a good idea to lay out
objectives a malicious

206
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:22,792
individual might have. These are
three objectives we came up with
for someone who wants to hack

207
00:19:22,792 --> 00:19:28,125
911. 	First objective is to
initiate emergency response when
one is not required or

208
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:32,208
appropriate. This may be an
individual who wants to disrupt
business operations at a

209
00:19:32,208 --> 00:19:37,167
competitor, play a prank on
their friend or redirect
emergency services to some end.

210
00:19:37,167 --> 00:19:41,333
Think about calling the cops in
to respond to a major incident
on the west side of town while

211
00:19:41,333 --> 00:19:47,083
you rob a jeweler on the east
side of town? 	>> The second
goal you might have is to

212
00:19:47,083 --> 00:19:53,542
interfere with the necessary
appropriate 911 response. Here I
may want to prevent someone from

213
00:19:53,542 --> 00:19:58,167
obtaining medical attention,
delay response to their call or
prevent an individual or

214
00:19:58,167 --> 00:20:03,042
institution from using 911
services altogether. To this end
perhaps I'm interested in

215
00:20:03,042 --> 00:20:08,333
denying access to PSAPs
themselves or the emergency
responders. 	>> Finally there is

216
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:12,375
possible value in the
surveillance of emergency
responders. So maybe you're an

217
00:20:12,375 --> 00:20:17,750
ambulance chaser or just want to
know when alarm response times
will be highest and then plan

218
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:21,875
your mayhem accordingly. 	>>
Let's jump in and talk about
possible weaknesses in the

219
00:20:21,875 --> 00:20:27,458
system. 	>> Talking about end
office control. In this
scenario, either control of end

220
00:20:27,458 --> 00:20:34,333
office or PBX linked to an end
office that lets you set your
ANI information arbitrarily you

221
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:41,125
can place a 911 call with a
falseified or invalid ANI field.
As a result PSAP can't determine

222
00:20:41,125 --> 00:20:45,083
your location with any certainty
and they will have to rely on
the information provided

223
00:20:45,083 --> 00:20:50,833
verbally by the caller. It's
important to note this type of
attack can basically be

224
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:56,333
accomplished using any mechanism
that strips off the ANI data. If
you get the call forwarded to

225
00:20:56,333 --> 00:21:03,125
911, the ANI information will be
incorrect or stripped. Also TTY
services can take advantage of

226
00:21:03,125 --> 00:21:10,000
this and as they may or may not
include ANI data. 	>> All of the
location determination

227
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,750
mechanisms we have looked at
here today rely on the ALI
database. If they were to alter

228
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:19,417
or own this you could change the
ALI record for a phone number to
your target address and then

229
00:21:19,417 --> 00:21:25,208
call in an emergency response.
	>> If you access this, you are
able to force the PSAP to rely

230
00:21:25,208 --> 00:21:29,250
on location information they are
given over the phone. We will
talk about how that may or may

231
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:33,250
not be reliable. So here it's
just really important how we
highlight how the entire

232
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:40,792
infrastructure relies very
heavily on this type of
mechanism. 	>> Have you ever

233
00:21:40,792 --> 00:21:46,042
powered on an old cell phone to
look up someone's number or
contact information and noticed

234
00:21:46,042 --> 00:21:50,375
that even though you are not
paying for service on that
device, the emergency call

235
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:55,958
feature looks like it's enabled?
That's on purpose! The 911
infrastructure was required to

236
00:21:55,958 --> 00:22:01,458
support these non-service
initialized or NSI cell phones.
	>> And here there is no

237
00:22:01,458 --> 00:22:07,292
callback number, as the phone
isn't subscribing to any service
so what is the exact CVN that's

238
00:22:07,292 --> 00:22:12,667
provided? Well in this situation
it's the number 911 plus the
last seven digits of the

239
00:22:12,667 --> 00:22:17,458
electronic serial number or
international mobile equipment
identity number which is

240
00:22:17,458 --> 00:22:22,000
specific to the phone itself.
Like the phone's MAC address,
but these calls are still

241
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:27,500
subject to location
determination in either phase 1
or 2 depending on where you

242
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:32,708
actually are at the time when
you place that call. 	>> Just to
kind of review remember with the

243
00:22:32,708 --> 00:22:37,458
wireless phase 2 environment you
are relying on location data
from the mobile handset in

244
00:22:37,458 --> 00:22:42,167
addition to tower triangulation
so it's definitely possible to
inject an arbitrary latitude or

245
00:22:42,167 --> 00:22:48,125
longitude through GPS spoofing
or getting the phone to think it
is where it is now by modifying

246
00:22:48,125 --> 00:22:52,208
the firmware. So this call will
still be routed to the
appropriate PSAP but once the

247
00:22:52,208 --> 00:22:58,583
call reaches PSAP you can make
the PSAP think the call is
coming from an arbitrary

248
00:22:58,583 --> 00:23:03,208
location. This is a little bit
more believable when your
arbitrary location is still in

249
00:23:03,208 --> 00:23:07,958
the same area serviced by the
PSAP and not like crazy like you
are calling from North Korea.

250
00:23:10,958 --> 00:23:15,292
	>> Again, taking a look at the
critical data storage along
those fault loads, VoIP service

251
00:23:15,292 --> 00:23:19,458
provider databases which
maintain that mapping between
the subscriber and their actual

252
00:23:19,458 --> 00:23:25,083
location, that would also be an
interesting target. Changing to
that database or denial of

253
00:23:25,083 --> 00:23:29,625
service to that aspect of the
provider's infrastructure would
have the same impact as

254
00:23:29,625 --> 00:23:34,250
modifying or denying access to
the ALI database, but with
potentially a different security

255
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:40,000
posture than the ALI database.
	>> So we even after we get
through the call flow and into

256
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,542
the latter part of response we
see some large areas for
disrupting or altering the call.

257
00:23:44,542 --> 00:23:50,500
We have to keep in mind PSAP
itself is a physical location.
One of the people we talked to

258
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:55,792
said when I interviewed to work
at the 911 center I expected
high levels of security, guards

259
00:23:55,792 --> 00:24:01,000
with guns, high fences and heavy
locked doors. What I saw was a
normal building, poor visible

260
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:06,875
security and the smiling faces
of people waited to be socially
engineered. 	>>Traditionally

261
00:24:06,875 --> 00:24:12,208
PSAPs were segmented or air
gaped such that phone systems
and CAD systems and general work

262
00:24:12,208 --> 00:24:17,250
stations for e-mail and web
browsing were all separated or
broken out. PSAPs we talked to

263
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:22,333
noted segmentation barriers have
gradually broken down overtime
to increase integration and

264
00:24:22,333 --> 00:24:26,333
decrease administration
overhead. So penetrating these
systems would not only be

265
00:24:26,333 --> 00:24:30,750
desirable if you wanted to see
service but could be very
valuable for establishing

266
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:35,750
surveillance. Some of the folks
we interviewed denied having any
incident response plans or basic

267
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:41,458
security practices such as
anti-virus in these dispatch
centers. 	>> The second

268
00:24:41,458 --> 00:24:47,667
potential for attack after the
PSAP itself would be to attack
the responding units. Almost all

269
00:24:47,667 --> 00:24:51,042
fire and ambulance engines
either have their own locally
broadcasted cell wireless -- for

270
00:24:51,042 --> 00:24:57,042
transmitting things like EKGs or
vital patient data from the
field to receiving hospital.

271
00:25:01,875 --> 00:25:06,458
These units rely on cellular
connectivity. One of the
individuals we interviewed

272
00:25:06,458 --> 00:25:12,292
talked about how on dozens of
their ambulances these wireless
hot spots themselves were only

273
00:25:12,292 --> 00:25:17,833
encrypted with 64-bit WIP
encryption and they are using
that to transmit vitally

274
00:25:17,833 --> 00:25:23,417
important data that may or may
not save this patient's life.
	So we talked through some

275
00:25:23,417 --> 00:25:31,125
weaknesses in the system. Let's
talk about actual attacks
scenarios. 	As mentioned earlier

276
00:25:31,125 --> 00:25:35,417
one of the goals an attacker
might have would be to initiate
a police, fire, or medical

277
00:25:35,417 --> 00:25:40,292
response to location that is not
in need of one. Most notable is
example known as swatting.

278
00:25:40,292 --> 00:25:47,500
During swatting an attacker
initiates a 911 call and falsely
reports to dispatcher that some

279
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:52,083
crime like a hostage situation
or active shooter is currently
happening at a particular

280
00:25:52,083 --> 00:25:58,708
location. In more sophisticated
attacks, attacker will
impersonate the target they are

281
00:25:58,708 --> 00:26:04,750
trying to actually get a SWAT
response to, implement various
obfuscation techniques or try to

282
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:10,667
hide their identities to target
a particular PSAP which can be
difficult. To make their call

283
00:26:10,667 --> 00:26:17,583
more believable so that when you
call that in it will be more
likely to produce a SWAT

284
00:26:17,583 --> 00:26:24,708
response. Now what is are about
to hear is a call from an actual
SWATTER. Really messed up. Pay

285
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:29,083
attention to the call flow
because there's a couple things
we want to highlight here. First

286
00:26:29,083 --> 00:26:35,292
the SWATTER is unable to target
the specific PSAP that is
services his target so he has to

287
00:26:35,292 --> 00:26:40,292
get transferred, then also perk
up when that transfer happens
because there are tones that

288
00:26:40,292 --> 00:26:46,500
will be used during the transfer
call. We'll talk about that
later on. 	>> 991 how can I help

289
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:52,500
you 	I am at ** Main Street
Colorado 	Not sure if a good
address Can you verify that for

290
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:03,000
me? 	It's *** Main Street 	Not
sure that's an valid address
	What do you want the phone

291
00:27:06,417 --> 00:27:12,417
number? 	Give that for me
	719-393-0078 	Home phone? 	Yes
it is 	No what's going on there?

292
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:21,250
	Listen here I got 2 people held
hostage 	Okay 	You know what
happens here right? It's not

293
00:27:24,625 --> 00:27:30,625
like on the movies understand
that? 	Okay 	One of the people
here is named Danielle and her

294
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:40,000
father. The reason why I am
doing this is because her father
raped my sister 	Okay 	And I am

295
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:50,500
armed okay, I have a pistol and
I swear to god I will kill these
people. If any cops come in this

296
00:27:53,917 --> 00:27:59,917
house with any gun I will shoot
them. 	Name sir? 	John Steffano
	Are you in Security? 	What do

297
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:19,625
you mean 	Are you in the town
Security? It is out of my area
Yes 	So you are in security?

298
00:28:19,625 --> 00:28:24,500
	Yes 	So I need to transfer you
to the sherrif's office there
	Can I ask you a question? 	Sure

299
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:29,875
	I am going to need you to stay
on the line cuz I am not talking
to these people anymore. 	Okay

300
00:28:29,875 --> 00:28:35,875
	I've had enough of this shit.
Remember I am armed and I will
shoot 	What kind of gun? 	A .22

301
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:45,000
	A pistol? 	Yes it is 	2 people
there? 	An 18 year old and her
father 	Stay with me 	They are

302
00:28:56,667 --> 00:29:02,667
duct tapped in together in the
next room 	Let them know I am
transferring over and wanted me

303
00:29:11,667 --> 00:29:17,667
to stay on the phone 	(Ringing)
	This is Jennifer can I help
you? 	This is Crystal with the

304
00:29:21,667 --> 00:29:27,667
city I am transferring a call
over to you it's a hostage
situation at *** Main Street in

305
00:29:31,667 --> 00:29:37,667
Security, let me transfer him
over to you. He wants me to stay
on the line. John you still

306
00:29:42,208 --> 00:29:48,208
there 	Yes I am still here 	I
got the county on the line here
	John? Tell me what is going on

307
00:29:54,917 --> 00:30:02,375
	>> So yeah that's pretty messed
up to call and initiate a threat
like that. We don't know why

308
00:30:02,375 --> 00:30:09,000
people want to do this, motives
vary but targets at very least
humiliate them and there have

309
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:14,583
been many reports of victims
dangerously coming close to the
accidental use of lethal force

310
00:30:14,583 --> 00:30:21,208
so it's not a benign practice.
	>> All right. Several we'll
known celebrities have been

311
00:30:21,208 --> 00:30:26,792
targets including Justin Bieber
and Ashton Kutcher. Recently, in
Arizona, a 15-year-old boy was a

312
00:30:26,792 --> 00:30:32,792
target after he talked some
smack on XBox party chat. Last
year the disturbingly we saw

313
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:42,250
some journalists targeted for
publishing in cyber criminal
identities so it's an increasing

314
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:47,792
tact. 	>> As we showed you
earlier the ability for a 911
system to identify who is

315
00:30:47,792 --> 00:30:53,208
calling and where that caller is
is pretty extensive. How do
attackers avoid identification?

316
00:30:53,208 --> 00:30:59,208
So believe it or not the person
who swatted Ashton Kutcher and
Justin Beiber was a 12-year-old

317
00:31:01,833 --> 00:31:08,083
boy and he utilized a popular
telephone service for the deaf
called TTY or text telephone.

318
00:31:08,083 --> 00:31:12,292
This is an example of an old-ass
one right here. Many deaf
nowadays don't carry this stuff

319
00:31:12,292 --> 00:31:18,458
around as they can use online
services or various apps. And
traditionally these services

320
00:31:18,458 --> 00:31:22,917
allow a person to call a relay
service with this machine. Phone
number they wish to call is

321
00:31:22,917 --> 00:31:27,125
communicate and the relay
operators calls the number on a
separate line. When that person

322
00:31:27,125 --> 00:31:30,583
answers they talk to the
operator who communicates her
role, that the person is using

323
00:31:30,583 --> 00:31:37,375
TTY. Then the deaf person can
type the desired messages to the
relay operator who will read

324
00:31:37,375 --> 00:31:41,792
them to the answering person and
that person can speak to the
operator who types back to the

325
00:31:41,792 --> 00:31:49,583
deaf person. 	Now if an attacker
dials the relay service and
conveys there is an emergency,

326
00:31:49,583 --> 00:31:53,333
operator will then call 911 and
report that whatever exactly the
TTY person is typing. The

327
00:31:53,333 --> 00:32:00,583
thought here is that the TTY
service strips some of the
potentially identifying

328
00:32:00,583 --> 00:32:05,458
information of the call such as
recording of their voice or in
some circumstances the actual

329
00:32:05,458 --> 00:32:12,042
ANI/ALI data attached to a
normal 911 call. 	>> Contrary to
popular belief caller ID

330
00:32:12,042 --> 00:32:17,375
spoofing is a method that almost
never works with regard to
masking your identity because

331
00:32:17,375 --> 00:32:22,208
most service providers won't
care what you claim your ANI
information to be. It will just

332
00:32:22,208 --> 00:32:29,583
insert whatever ANI is supposed
to be there and passes that to
the ALI database as well as

333
00:32:29,583 --> 00:32:35,583
PSAP. In rare circumstances,
where a few VoIP providers we
researched that will pass on

334
00:32:35,583 --> 00:32:41,667
proclaimed ANI without altering
or mending, but those are far
and few between, furthermore

335
00:32:41,667 --> 00:32:46,750
many anti-spoofing service
providers, like the one seen
here, treat 911 differently and

336
00:32:46,750 --> 00:32:53,167
will not connect without
altering the ANI back to record.
However there is one example.

337
00:32:53,167 --> 00:32:58,083
	>> One attack that can actually
benefit is circumventing
automatic routing in an effort

338
00:32:58,083 --> 00:33:03,917
to target a specific PSAP. PSAPs
have a 10 digit direct number.
Calls to this number are treated

339
00:33:03,917 --> 00:33:11,542
as emergency phone calls. This
number is most often used to
transfer between PSAPs in case

340
00:33:11,542 --> 00:33:17,750
you end up with the wrong PSAP
or the municipality dispatches
fire and police from separate

341
00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:24,167
centers. If an attacker uses a
VoIP provider that will push
that spoofed ANI the way through

342
00:33:24,167 --> 00:33:29,625
an attacker can initiate a
seemingly innocent-looking call
from that spoofed number to the

343
00:33:29,625 --> 00:33:35,583
10-digit PSAP using the
appropriate dial number and
place an emergency call. The

344
00:33:35,583 --> 00:33:39,792
general problem with this is
that these numbers are secret.
They are impossible to discover,

345
00:33:39,792 --> 00:33:46,250
right. Everyone out there,
impossible to discover, secret
things! Well, we were successful

346
00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:51,083
in enumerating several of these
by listening to the 911 call
that are recordings readily

347
00:33:51,083 --> 00:33:55,042
available on the Internet and
then listening for the DTMF
tones, remember I told to you

348
00:33:55,042 --> 00:34:03,000
perk up. Those are DTMF tones,
those aren't widely utilized
there are some other actual

349
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:08,417
schemas you can use to transfer
calls but if they use DTMF, you
can then record them, run them

350
00:34:08,417 --> 00:34:13,125
through a tone extractor and
enumerate the 10-digit PSAP
number. Thus an attacker could

351
00:34:13,125 --> 00:34:17,750
better target a specific PSAP
and could avoid the automatic
routing done upstream by the

352
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:23,250
carrier once a call has been
dialed. You may have noticed in
our swatting call that the

353
00:34:23,250 --> 00:34:28,042
dispatcher had to transfer the
caller to another center. This
would be a prime example of how

354
00:34:28,042 --> 00:34:33,500
difficult it can be to target a
particular PSAP. If you could be
successful in targeting a

355
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:39,375
particular PSAP that is local to
your target you may improve your
believability of your swatting

356
00:34:39,375 --> 00:34:45,708
call and then be more likely to
actually have a swatting
response. 	>> So remember that

357
00:34:45,708 --> 00:34:49,875
non-initialized phone call flow
we talked about before, where
you can basically call with a

358
00:34:49,875 --> 00:34:56,458
simless phone and the call back
is diversion of the phone's MAC
address. What's interesting

359
00:34:56,458 --> 00:35:01,417
about this is you have a level
of abstraction between the
caller and their identity that

360
00:35:01,417 --> 00:35:06,875
you can obtain old used cell
phones of craigslist and buyer
doesn't know who you are, you

361
00:35:06,875 --> 00:35:11,542
have just removed from your
identity from the standard links
between a 911 call and caller so

362
00:35:11,542 --> 00:35:16,208
you have all the mayhem with
much smaller chance of
attribution and entanglement

363
00:35:16,208 --> 00:35:23,042
with law enforcement. 	>> I know
many of you guys out there use
VoIP. You can use it anywhere,

364
00:35:23,042 --> 00:35:27,792
it's superior to a lot of
traditional services but you can
call anywhere from cell phone, a

365
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:34,042
SIP client, a laptop in a coffee
shop. How does the VoIP provider
allow you to change location? Is

366
00:35:34,042 --> 00:35:41,000
there any verification against
your billing address? For kicks
we actually tried a major VoIP

367
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:45,333
provider here in the U.S. and
observed the 911 location
mapping functionality features

368
00:35:45,333 --> 00:35:52,000
that were available to us. Here
you can see a thick client to
update to the VSP database.

369
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:56,083
Interestingly enough we were
able to change our location to
each other's address and other

370
00:35:56,083 --> 00:36:02,917
addresses without any notable
verification. 	How do you stop
911 from working the way it's

371
00:36:02,917 --> 00:36:07,667
supposed to? There's the
old-fashioned cable cut as seen
here. That will stop your target

372
00:36:07,667 --> 00:36:12,583
from calling from at least from
land lines. Cell phone jamming
is also a possibility if you

373
00:36:12,583 --> 00:36:17,333
want to conduct crime and
prevent folks from calling 911.
A cell phone jammer will provide

374
00:36:17,333 --> 00:36:23,250
you localized disruption in
services. If you can edit that
VSP or ALI record, we talked

375
00:36:23,250 --> 00:36:29,250
about earlier, for target you
may be able to ensure even if
they call 911 your response is

376
00:36:29,250 --> 00:36:33,125
directed to the wrong location.
Think about that. That web
request you just saw and think

377
00:36:33,125 --> 00:36:37,333
about some of the problems with
web servers, would it be
possible to use that to change

378
00:36:37,333 --> 00:36:43,917
an entry or record? Let's say
you want to get your murder on.
If you could alter the VSP or

379
00:36:43,917 --> 00:36:49,208
ALI record for intended target,
mind you now it's premeditated,
then you might be able to direct

380
00:36:49,208 --> 00:36:54,042
to emergency responders to the
wrong location if you don't
allow your victim enough time to

381
00:36:54,042 --> 00:37:00,417
state their true location to
dispatchers before you off them.
	>> Major weakness in many

382
00:37:00,417 --> 00:37:05,208
telephone systems obviously to
include 911 is resource
consumption. A PSAP only has so

383
00:37:05,208 --> 00:37:12,792
many dispatchers available and
only so many trunk or phone
lines for these calls. You can

384
00:37:12,792 --> 00:37:18,042
tie them all up and denied
access to 911. Obviously there
is a denial of service attack

385
00:37:18,042 --> 00:37:23,958
that must have been interesting
is the F.B.I. published a white
paper saying these types of

386
00:37:23,958 --> 00:37:30,083
attacks on PSAPs and Hospitals
are actually increasing
substantially. Interestingly

387
00:37:30,083 --> 00:37:36,167
enough there is a talk tomorrow,
track 1 at 10:00 AM I believe
that involves hacking cell

388
00:37:36,167 --> 00:37:42,542
phones to make it an automatic
dialer. So you have a portable
T-DOS. 	>> I'd like to draw

389
00:37:42,542 --> 00:37:46,708
attention to one particular
example of TDOS. We get this
question all the time. Is anyone

390
00:37:46,708 --> 00:37:53,000
actually doing this? They are. A
few years ago some jack ass
TDOS'd off an entire bank of

391
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:57,333
phones in a San Francisco
hospital and not only were the
lines in the emergency

392
00:37:57,333 --> 00:38:02,333
department that take calls from
incoming ambulances, trauma,
heart attracts and strokes

393
00:38:02,333 --> 00:38:08,833
disrupted but it inter-hospital
communications was also
disrupted so imagine the ICU

394
00:38:08,833 --> 00:38:16,250
teams trying to talk to the ICU
doctors, and when smooth
communication is disrupted,

395
00:38:16,250 --> 00:38:22,292
patients' lives are at risk. It
is that important of a thing.
	>> We already talked about the

396
00:38:22,292 --> 00:38:27,250
PSAP as being the location with
inherent vulnerabilities but
TDOS attacks highlight these are

397
00:38:27,250 --> 00:38:32,208
places staffed with people who
use machines to do work.
Therefore if you are either

398
00:38:32,208 --> 00:38:38,125
overwhelmed human ability to
respond or take out systems they
use to facilitate that response

399
00:38:38,125 --> 00:38:42,708
you can again rate negative
impact. Unfortunately based on
research many PSAPs are

400
00:38:42,708 --> 00:38:48,417
understaffed and continue to
support legacy computer systems
due to budgetary constraints. As

401
00:38:48,417 --> 00:38:53,000
noted earlier traditional
segmentation barriers and those
that support administrative

402
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:59,750
functions are on the decline.
These organizations have all the
same challenges of small company

403
00:38:59,750 --> 00:39:04,667
with limited budgets, extremely
high availability demands and
customers who want rapid

404
00:39:04,667 --> 00:39:08,833
response. You have to imagine
how challenging it can be to
keep up this type of

405
00:39:08,833 --> 00:39:15,292
organization and keep it secure.
		>> So what happens if you were
successful in TDOSing a

406
00:39:15,292 --> 00:39:20,833
particular PSAP? Well that
hasn't happened on a larger
scale but what we did see is an

407
00:39:20,833 --> 00:39:28,833
accidental denial of service for
six hours. In April, 4,500 calls
over six hours to 911 were

408
00:39:28,833 --> 00:39:33,292
denied in Washington, Oregon,
portions of California,
Pennsylvania, Minnesota,

409
00:39:33,292 --> 00:39:38,750
Florida, North Carolina, South
Carolina. The ALI database had
exhausted its call tracking

410
00:39:38,750 --> 00:39:44,833
tokens and no new calls could be
routed so people would call 911
and they got a busy signal.

411
00:39:44,833 --> 00:39:49,875
During this time one woman was
documented to have called 911
about 37 times and got the busy

412
00:39:49,875 --> 00:39:54,917
signal every single time while
an attacker actively tried to
break into her house. What about

413
00:39:54,917 --> 00:40:00,750
people during that time that had
heart attacks and strokes? Did
they suffer damage they can

414
00:40:00,750 --> 00:40:05,583
never get back or did they die
as a result of that delayed 911
response? 	>> So swatting Justin

415
00:40:05,583 --> 00:40:09,083
Beiber is great but what about
when you mess with the 911
system when people actually need

416
00:40:09,083 --> 00:40:13,542
it but can't depend on it? So
What is the true impact of a 911
hack and how do you measure the

417
00:40:13,542 --> 00:40:17,208
cost to Betty White with a heart
wttack who can't get help
because someone changed their

418
00:40:17,208 --> 00:40:21,708
address in a ALI database. So
let's kind of talk about that,
how much do even minute-long

419
00:40:21,708 --> 00:40:29,042
delays end up costing victims?
	>> Hard to say without being
able to see the future. Most

420
00:40:29,042 --> 00:40:34,792
serious medical problems, mere
minutes mean the difference.
Take cardiac arrest for example,

421
00:40:34,792 --> 00:40:39,000
in our state the average time
from when you pick up the phone
and call 911 to when someone

422
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:43,625
arrives at the house is about
six minutes, all of you are
thinking that's really long.

423
00:40:43,625 --> 00:40:49,500
That's really an amazing
response time for the United
States. When someone has a

424
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:55,583
cardiac arrest, you can see
their survivability decreases
greatly without intervention, at

425
00:40:55,583 --> 00:41:01,083
two minutes without oxygen heart
must also begin to die, at the
six-minute mark they have less

426
00:41:01,083 --> 00:41:06,750
than a 50% chance of survival.
	>> So CPR can extend but our
hypothetical victim is still

427
00:41:06,750 --> 00:41:11,542
looking at significant increases
in mortality with every minute
hat pases, it's not unrealistic

428
00:41:11,542 --> 00:41:17,292
to say even a delay of 5 to 15
minutes can end up killing
people. 	>> This is a similar

429
00:41:17,292 --> 00:41:24,500
pattern with other things. From
penetrating trauma to strokes to
breathing problems. Taking a

430
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:28,625
step back and thinking on a more
global scale these systems are
heavily relied upon by

431
00:41:28,625 --> 00:41:34,917
individuals in dire situations.
Consider the benefits to a
foreign state or non-state

432
00:41:34,917 --> 00:41:39,833
threat agent to exploit or deny
access to emergency response
systems. Furthermore note it

433
00:41:39,833 --> 00:41:44,167
would be possible to target any
country or locality's emergency
response infrastructure, not

434
00:41:44,167 --> 00:41:48,625
just the United States. Imagine
the loss of competence, panic,
of loss of life which could

435
00:41:48,625 --> 00:41:55,333
occur if different structures
were targeted to get accomplish
state or non-state objectives.

436
00:41:55,333 --> 00:41:59,208
We talked a lot about potential
problems but want to talk about
potential solutions for the

437
00:41:59,208 --> 00:42:04,833
issues we noted. One of our
objectives was not just to poke
holes in something we all really

438
00:42:04,833 --> 00:42:11,167
appreciate. I have not needed to
use 911 yet but after this talk
is over I intend to drink my way

439
00:42:11,167 --> 00:42:16,000
into an ambulance ride. Before I
get there, let's talk about a
few of these solutions we have

440
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:21,417
come up with to address the
issues so far. In the current
global payment environment it's

441
00:42:21,417 --> 00:42:25,917
possible for each transaction to
be assessed for potential fraud
indicators. This can occur when

442
00:42:25,917 --> 00:42:29,583
the delivery address doesn't
match the billing address or
payer's name doesn't match the

443
00:42:29,583 --> 00:42:33,625
recipient. These are simple
examples but the fraud catches
available for payment

444
00:42:33,625 --> 00:42:39,542
environment are pretty robust,
with thresholds configurable on
merchants and payment networks.

445
00:42:39,542 --> 00:42:45,042
	>> So quickly we'll hit some of
these. What if a 911 system had
call-grabbing red flags to

446
00:42:45,042 --> 00:42:50,125
allocate risk ratings based on
indicators seen and maybe these
red flags don't result in

447
00:42:50,125 --> 00:42:55,250
priority or queuing changes but
rather result in indicators or
alert on the CAD system? What

448
00:42:55,250 --> 00:42:58,500
we're saying is we don't want
dispatchers to focus on things
that don't matter. We want them

449
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:03,083
to deliver care in a timely
fashion, but maybe there's a way
to assign competent values or

450
00:43:03,083 --> 00:43:08,833
validity values as they come in
to assign them to each call. 	>>
So for denial of service why

451
00:43:08,833 --> 00:43:12,000
don't we use some of the
solutions we have seen in
application and networking areas

452
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:16,250
like in order to mitigate PSAP
resource consumption by TDOSing,
insert some sort of proof of

453
00:43:16,250 --> 00:43:20,500
worker intelligence system kind
of like a captcha 	>> This
doesn't have to be nearly as

454
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:26,042
robust. Let's use common things
we have seen in other services
like press 2 for English and

455
00:43:26,042 --> 00:43:33,500
para Espanol a prima quatrro,
that might be 3 for English, and
ocho for Espanol. We don't want

456
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:39,417
to cut into response times here
but simple scenarios might be
used to mitigate TDOS attacks.

457
00:43:39,417 --> 00:43:43,583
On a more nationally we want to
highlight these organizations
which have done a phenomenal job

458
00:43:43,583 --> 00:43:48,083
helping folks day in and day out
have done so with limited
security standards to guide them

459
00:43:48,083 --> 00:43:51,500
on what they can do to protect
this infrastructure. The
national emergency number

460
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:56,125
association, or NENA, published
a security standard for next
generation 911 systems; however,

461
00:43:56,125 --> 00:44:00,625
there is no express penalty for
noncompliance. Experts in the
field, that we spoke to,

462
00:44:00,625 --> 00:44:05,958
estimate under half of the
organizations actually comply
citing disparate and often

463
00:44:05,958 --> 00:44:09,125
constrained budgets. By
recognizing the importance of
the service and the need to

464
00:44:09,125 --> 00:44:13,292
secure it, we may help get
resources and motivation to the
organizations that need them to

465
00:44:13,292 --> 00:44:19,000
protect life and limb. 	So we're
running pretty low on time. We
didn't do a good job on time

466
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:24,708
management. Let's pop to the
end, It's difficult to condense
this all into 45 minutes. We

467
00:44:24,708 --> 00:44:28,042
have a lot more to that we'd
like talk about as far as
solutions and further

468
00:44:28,042 --> 00:44:32,333
contributing to make the system
a little bit better. So if you
have any experience at all with

469
00:44:32,333 --> 00:44:36,958
911 or would like to collaborate
or any further questions, find
us around, we'll get your

470
00:44:36,958 --> 00:44:40,875
e-mails and get in touch with
you because we would love to
talk to you. Sorry we ran a

471
00:44:40,875 --> 00:44:45,958
little bit late at the end. 	>>
We really want to emphasize how
much respect we have for the

472
00:44:45,958 --> 00:44:50,708
hard work everyone does on a
daily basis from the folks at
the phone companies to the

473
00:44:50,708 --> 00:44:54,917
local, municipal, state, and
federal officials, to
dispatchers to first responders,

474
00:44:54,917 --> 00:44:59,292
every stakeholder in this
process goes to work every day
hoping and working to support a

475
00:44:59,292 --> 00:45:03,583
system that saves lives and we
really want to thank them for
those efforts but still

476
00:45:03,583 --> 00:45:07,792
highlight that there are aspects
of this system that could be
secured better. 	>> All right.

477
00:45:07,792 --> 00:45:13,792
Well, let's thank them, all the
responders and we thank you for
showing up to our talk.

478
00:45:18,208 --> 00:45:20,208
(Applause)
