1
00:00:00,042 --> 00:00:07,500
>> Good morning. So welcome.
This is the Cavalry Year 0. I'm
Nick Percoco and this is Josh

2
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:12,875
Corman. A little bit about
myself real quick in my day job
I'm vice president of strategic

3
00:00:12,875 --> 00:00:18,917
services at Rapid 7. But this is
not about my day job I am one of
the cofounders of the Cavalry

4
00:00:18,917 --> 00:00:24,667
movement along with Josh and my
big motivation for being here
and working with Josh in this is

5
00:00:24,667 --> 00:00:29,625
I want to see a day, I want to
live in the future and be able
to enjoy life in the future

6
00:00:29,625 --> 00:00:35,875
utilizing technology and have my
family and my friends my father
my wife my kids feel the

7
00:00:35,875 --> 00:00:41,250
experience technology and never
have to worry about using a
piece of technology or being

8
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:45,375
required to use a piece of
technology for their own health
and being in fear that theirs

9
00:00:45,375 --> 00:00:51,000
going to be a software flaw or
bug that's going to cause them
harm. >> And I'm Josh Corman, in

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,333
my day job I'm the CTO for Sawn
Site and I too am not here
representing them I speak for

11
00:00:55,333 --> 00:01:00,875
myself as a citizen and a father
and as someone who is deeply
concerned about our dependence

12
00:01:00,875 --> 00:01:05,208
on technology. In our
professions right, whether you
started this out of curiosity as

13
00:01:05,208 --> 00:01:10,250
a hobby and which became your
profession, software and
security issues now permeates

14
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:15,125
every single aspect of your life
and that's increasingly in the
case. So if we know how bad a

15
00:01:15,125 --> 00:01:19,667
job we're doing as a security
industry with 80 billion dollars
of spending trying to protect

16
00:01:19,667 --> 00:01:25,417
random pieces of plastic and
magnetic stripes I believe a
higher standard of care and our

17
00:01:25,417 --> 00:01:28,833
best and brightest should be
focused a little bit on things
that effect public safety and

18
00:01:28,833 --> 00:01:33,875
human life . So we're really
happy to see the change in the
DEF CON community toward things

19
00:01:33,875 --> 00:01:38,875
of consequence. >>So here's
where we where last year.
Anybody in the room, were you at

20
00:01:38,875 --> 00:01:44,708
the talk last year 10:00 a.m. on
Sunday? Oh Wow, Great and thanks
for being here today. So last

21
00:01:44,708 --> 00:01:50,000
year we started out, you know
this was a conversation that we
had with all of you in the room.

22
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
This was not, we didn't know
where this was going to be or
where we would be but a year

23
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,708
later, but we started out the
conversation about body, mind
and soul were really the planks

24
00:01:57,708 --> 00:02:03,958
of the platform we were looking
towards. Public good, human
safety, human life on the body

25
00:02:03,958 --> 00:02:08,167
side. On the mind was security
research and as security
research I was very concerned

26
00:02:08,167 --> 00:02:13,208
about that piece and then soul
which was civil liberties and
we're going to talk a little bit

27
00:02:13,208 --> 00:02:18,042
about where we've moved and
settled on but today we have
some important announcements. >>

28
00:02:18,042 --> 00:02:24,375
One year ago we asked you to
suspend your cynicism. I think
the soul of the hacker is really

29
00:02:24,375 --> 00:02:30,542
curiosity and puzzle but too
many of us walk around the halls
here with our defining

30
00:02:30,542 --> 00:02:36,917
characteristic being cynicism
and defeat. And we did not want
to go quietly. We wanted to find

31
00:02:36,917 --> 00:02:43,000
our spirit again and apply the
trade that we've assembled into
things that have consequences.

32
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:50,125
And as such we said please don't
taze us bro give us one year. If
you want to ignore us fine but

33
00:02:50,125 --> 00:02:55,042
give us a chance for one year of
experimentation and we'll come
back to you and we'll say if we

34
00:02:55,042 --> 00:02:59,792
should keep trying or not, if
there's hope or if we're
encouraged or discouraged. So

35
00:02:59,792 --> 00:03:06,042
slightly tongue in cheek here,
it's too hard, I think we're
going to give up. The spirit of

36
00:03:06,042 --> 00:03:12,083
the cavalry though seriously was
that we looked high and low, we
met with as high ranking people

37
00:03:12,083 --> 00:03:17,417
you can in the government and
intelligence community trying to
think naively that if we brought

38
00:03:17,417 --> 00:03:23,500
the right message to the right
people in the right power they'd
fix it and as depressing as it

39
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:28,750
was to realize the cavalry isn't
coming they aren't going to fix
it, it was also empowering

40
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:33,875
because that means it falls to
us. We can be the technically
literate voice of reason and

41
00:03:33,875 --> 00:03:38,250
become ambassadors to educate
them and to frame the issues for
them so they'll make smarter

42
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:43,833
choices. But here's the sarcasm
tag we couldn't get through the
medical devise manufactures and

43
00:03:43,833 --> 00:03:47,958
we couldn't get through to the
auto manufacturers it's just an
untrackable problem so instead

44
00:03:47,958 --> 00:03:53,958
we're going to make lots of
money selling products. So we're
going to unveil right now for

45
00:03:53,958 --> 00:03:58,875
the first time ever on stage
where going to have a solution
to some of our friends medical

46
00:03:58,875 --> 00:04:04,375
device problems. So first off I
met a woman named Marie who is
the Director of Cert in Norway

47
00:04:04,375 --> 00:04:09,667
and she is about our age and she
has a pacemaker, and she's
concerned that it will kill her.

48
00:04:09,667 --> 00:04:13,625
And because the medical device
manufacturers really don't take
this issue seriously because no

49
00:04:13,625 --> 00:04:17,250
one has died yet from hacking
even though there's no logging
to prove if they have or

50
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:25,000
haven't. We've decided to make a
line of clothing so, can you
please welcome to the stage our

51
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:31,000
model. [Applause] >> Those with
a medical condition should not
be required to sacrifice their

52
00:04:39,125 --> 00:04:45,667
night life. Not only will it
keep you shielded from unwanted
interference you will shock and

53
00:04:45,667 --> 00:04:51,000
amaze your friends at the
fashion. Now this is our evening
wear but we also have, you

54
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:57,000
should see the lingerie
collection. Let's give a round
applause for Nicole. And I think

55
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,708
we should probably auction that
off later to charity. What do
you think about that? >> Good

56
00:05:05,708 --> 00:05:13,167
idea. Yah. Would anybody buy
that? >> No. >> But wait there's
more. So we had some money left

57
00:05:13,167 --> 00:05:17,792
over from our R & D budget and
we spent the last year working
with our friends who are

58
00:05:17,792 --> 00:05:24,000
diabetics. And Jay Radcliff
specifically he put a lot of
hard hours work into developing

59
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,708
a new product that I'm happy to
unveil today. And this is a nine
volt intrusion detection system

60
00:05:29,708 --> 00:05:35,708
for insulin pumps and they
should be available next year
around this time. >> As many of

61
00:05:37,833 --> 00:05:43,000
you saw yesterday we revealed a
five star auto safety program
for the car industry. And

62
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,625
because we want to hedge our
bets and we hope they do the
right thing, we're also going to

63
00:05:47,625 --> 00:05:54,750
unveil an antivirus product for
your car. >> So in all
seriousness what we wanted to do

64
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:59,083
with this first portion of this
presentation is to really
solidify the messaging around

65
00:05:59,083 --> 00:06:05,000
what the Cavalry is all about
and bring you through that
process. Last year when we got

66
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:10,292
on stage and did this we didn't
have a solid message, we didn't
really know where we would

67
00:06:10,292 --> 00:06:14,042
exactly evolve into at this
point. So what we want to just
walk you through sort of the

68
00:06:14,042 --> 00:06:18,250
thought process and walk you
through, you know, the various
aspects of how we're actually

69
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:22,583
accomplishing and plan to
accomplish what we're working
towards. So first, our problem

70
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:27,583
statement. >> So, you know I am
a big fan of Dan Gear and he
often talks of security in terms

71
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:32,458
of our dependence right if we're
dependent upon it and if it's
worthy of that dependence so

72
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:36,333
really what stuck in it for us
and really works in the belt way
and with policy makers and the

73
00:06:36,333 --> 00:06:40,875
general public is the simple
truth the immutable truth that
our dependence on technology is

74
00:06:40,875 --> 00:06:46,833
growing faster than our ability
to secure it. >> And the second
half of that is while we

75
00:06:46,833 --> 00:06:52,458
struggle to secure organizations
connected technologies; really
they now permeated every aspect

76
00:06:52,458 --> 00:06:56,917
of our lives. They're in our
cars, they're in our bodies
they're in our homes and even in

77
00:06:56,917 --> 00:07:03,250
our public infrastructure. So
you know, just think about that.
Think about, does anybody in the

78
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:09,250
room disagree with that problem
statement? No. >> Alright. So,
we're not good at mission

79
00:07:11,958 --> 00:07:14,500
statements we're good at
security. But not so much
mission statements. But this

80
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:19,083
catches the gist of what we want
to capture we want to ensure
that technology potential impact

81
00:07:19,083 --> 00:07:23,417
public safety and human life are
worthy of trust. Doesn't means
we can go fix them but we're

82
00:07:23,417 --> 00:07:28,000
going to do what we can with our
power with our talent, with our
power of story and research and

83
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:34,042
by teaming with industry to make
sure that we can achieve these
goals and we've approached this

84
00:07:34,042 --> 00:07:38,375
with what we call the four C's
or collecting, connecting,
collaborating, and catalyzing.

85
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:44,125
When we say I am the cavalry
it's not Josh it's not Nick it's
all of you, it's our talent pool

86
00:07:44,125 --> 00:07:49,417
it's a personal commitment that
you say aloud which essentially
says I'm going to be part of the

87
00:07:49,417 --> 00:07:53,208
solution. If I am a researcher
and I know how to break things I
am going to be part of that life

88
00:07:53,208 --> 00:07:57,333
cycle. If I don't know how to
break things but if I know how
to securely architect and fix

89
00:07:57,333 --> 00:08:02,708
things we need you as well. If
you are a project manager we're
horrible at logistic but we need

90
00:08:02,708 --> 00:08:08,333
to act like a campaign that
needs to be managed in multiple
phases. And the cavalry was

91
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:14,500
really about acting on these
four C's. The general idea was
we're not going to invent from

92
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:18,625
whole cloth we're going to
collect and connect excuse me
collect existing research and

93
00:08:18,625 --> 00:08:23,333
researchers this tremendous body
of work going back many, many
years on things like auto

94
00:08:23,333 --> 00:08:27,833
hacking on things like medical
devices we do not need to invent
from whole cloth. The challenge

95
00:08:27,833 --> 00:08:32,292
is we do a lot of solo action
and when we combine the medical
devise researchers on our first

96
00:08:32,292 --> 00:08:36,833
call some knew how to hack
devises but couldn't find how to
get them. Others knew how to get

97
00:08:36,833 --> 00:08:40,458
them but had no idea what to do
with them some of them had
relationships in the FDA or

98
00:08:40,458 --> 00:08:45,708
worked at different
manufacturers like a Med Tronic
or a GE a Phillips etc. -- so

99
00:08:45,708 --> 00:08:53,167
when we connected them together
- >> We bring people together,
sorry. We connect the

100
00:08:53,167 --> 00:08:58,500
researchers with other folks in
the entire chain. We spoke last
year about something called

101
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:03,375
fuzzing the chain of influence,
trying to bridge the gap between
security researcher and the

102
00:09:03,375 --> 00:09:08,500
executive at a manufacturer and
be able to connect those people
together, connecting the

103
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:13,458
researchers, connecting those to
people in media, people in
policy to get the right message

104
00:09:13,458 --> 00:09:18,917
out. We found that's going to be
very, very effective, it has
been effective so far. >> You

105
00:09:18,917 --> 00:09:24,250
know, and the collaborating we
really have to have a tone of
team work. There are multiple

106
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:29,500
methods to get attention. This
weekend and in earlier black hat
you can name and chain. Right.

107
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:34,667
We can find bugs, throw them
over the wall, use that as a
catalyst sometimes that works.

108
00:09:34,667 --> 00:09:38,167
We chose we wanted to be
teammates, and we wanted to
ready ourselves to be better

109
00:09:38,167 --> 00:09:43,792
listeners, more empathetic and
find the right stakeholders in
these organizations many of whom

110
00:09:43,792 --> 00:09:47,583
want to do the right thing. They
just need help. They don't have
the knowledge, or they don't

111
00:09:47,583 --> 00:09:51,583
have the air cover or they don't
have the stimulus to do so, so
it's the collaboration where we

112
00:09:51,583 --> 00:09:54,667
started brain storming saying
how do we get around these
intractable problems? We're

113
00:09:54,667 --> 00:09:59,917
hackers. If we can jail break an
iPhone we can figure a way to
get more safety standards

114
00:09:59,917 --> 00:10:03,833
through the FDA or through the
auto industry. And then we're
going to continue fail fast or

115
00:10:03,833 --> 00:10:09,250
iterate until we have done so.
>> And then the last one is
catalyzing. You know, through

116
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:13,542
our efforts and through the
public awareness of what we're
working on and even awareness

117
00:10:13,542 --> 00:10:17,708
within the echo chamber and
outside the echo chamber if
we're able to fuel additional

118
00:10:17,708 --> 00:10:21,750
research and more people to make
a decision between say finding
an android vulnerability and

119
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:26,500
finding a vulnerability in a
medical device that's going to
be better for everybody else and

120
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:31,000
just trying to catalyze that and
fuel that research in a
direction where it's focused on

121
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:37,000
public safety and human life. >>
So if they're not coming, will
you answer the call? I can't

122
00:10:39,375 --> 00:10:45,375
hear you. Will you answer the
call? Are you up for the job?
Because it falls to you. >> All

123
00:10:50,458 --> 00:10:53,083
right. So this has been the
monster so we'll go quick
through this and talk about some

124
00:10:53,083 --> 00:10:58,083
of the development in the last
24 hours. So we believe that we
have to be ambassadors, right,

125
00:10:58,083 --> 00:11:03,750
this isn't a technical challenge
this is a communication and
education challenge. We have to

126
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:10,750
be a voice of literacy. We will
not get anywhere if Congress
thinks the internet is a series

127
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:16,583
of tubes. We will not get
anywhere if we let the headlines
dominate that there's killer

128
00:11:16,583 --> 00:11:22,083
attacker frig's sending spam and
oh my god little cats - oh my
god, we're all going to die and

129
00:11:22,083 --> 00:11:28,333
that's not gonna be the most
important prioritized issue. So
if we don't fill the void that

130
00:11:28,333 --> 00:11:33,208
void will be filled by others,
they'll be filled by charlatans,
by snake oil salesmen so we need

131
00:11:33,208 --> 00:11:38,542
to be that voice, the
independent voice and we have to
research things that matter. I

132
00:11:38,542 --> 00:11:42,917
mean yes a lot of us got in this
because we like to tinker with
things. Any thing. If you want

133
00:11:42,917 --> 00:11:47,417
to tinker with anything why not
make it something that can
actually affect your family or

134
00:11:47,417 --> 00:11:54,625
your future. And most
importantly doing these things
alone we are easily defeated

135
00:11:54,625 --> 00:12:00,000
right? And when you link up with
teammate you can do more. And
when you form a raid of five

136
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,875
different talents you can
actually tackle a dungeon. And
if you want to kill the dragons

137
00:12:04,875 --> 00:12:11,667
it takes a guild so we have the
most talented most innovative
most creative, most adaptive

138
00:12:11,667 --> 00:12:16,625
talent pool in the world right
here and we have the knowledge
and the power to do something so

139
00:12:16,625 --> 00:12:21,542
that's going to come by working
together. And most of all, this
is probably both our biggest

140
00:12:21,542 --> 00:12:25,375
strength and our biggest failure
this past year when where
introspective, is that this

141
00:12:25,375 --> 00:12:29,625
isn't about talking to
ourselves. We need to work with
each other but this is about

142
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:34,500
getting the hell out of the echo
chamber. Screaming at each
other, screaming in the darkness

143
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:40,500
and kvetching at the bar is not
going to fix anything so this is
an outward facing initiative. >>

144
00:12:44,042 --> 00:12:48,250
And finally we must team with
each other. You know thinking
about as an independent

145
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:53,708
researcher you're often sitting
there in the dark on your own
working on your project but when

146
00:12:53,708 --> 00:12:58,458
you pick your head up and look
around and find like minded
folks who want to help out and

147
00:12:58,458 --> 00:13:02,000
want to help out even with
aspects of they're not deep
technical but they have skills

148
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,250
in other ways that can help your
research, you find yourself much
more powerful and be able to

149
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:12,250
complete even greater tasks. >>
We have, so now we're going to
switch gears a little bit to

150
00:13:14,583 --> 00:13:21,583
some of our year zero
activities. You want to call out
some people? >> All right so

151
00:13:21,583 --> 00:13:26,458
most of this has been about
people and one of the bad pieces
of disinformation we've had

152
00:13:26,458 --> 00:13:30,875
within our echo chamber because
we haven't done a good job in
communicating is this is not a

153
00:13:30,875 --> 00:13:36,167
handful of people. This is not
an exclusive club. We have a few
hundred people on the mailing

154
00:13:36,167 --> 00:13:40,917
you list actively participating,
we have several dozen
researchers and several dozen

155
00:13:40,917 --> 00:13:46,625
people who work in medical,
auto, critical infrastructure
this is a very large and growing

156
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:50,917
collaboration. And the
difference has not been again,
it's not been our technical

157
00:13:50,917 --> 00:13:54,125
skills, it's people who have
stood out and said I'm going to
be part of the solution so we're

158
00:13:54,125 --> 00:14:00,708
going to call out a few in no
particular order. We'll just go
back and forth. So Mike Murray

159
00:14:00,708 --> 00:14:06,708
quit his own company he started
to go take a job in the medical
devise manufacturing world and

160
00:14:06,708 --> 00:14:12,083
he's single handily driving and
defining a very robust secure
software development life cycle,

161
00:14:12,083 --> 00:14:16,042
for one of the largest devise
manufacturers in the world.
We're not just throwing a bug at

162
00:14:16,042 --> 00:14:21,458
them he changed his career to go
directly impact and he's going
to pull in all of the talent

163
00:14:21,458 --> 00:14:27,500
pool from all of his friends
here to do so. Katie Misuris one
of the pillars of the research

164
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:31,750
community from mat stake days
and what not and who basically
caused Microsoft to have the

165
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:35,458
very first bug bounty program in
history. She wrote the ico
standards on coordinating

166
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:40,958
disclosure to help drive more
collaboration between
researchers instead of law

167
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:46,708
suits. And she's has recently
quit her job and now is the
chief policy officer for Hacker

168
00:14:46,708 --> 00:14:52,292
One to help create a normalized
interface that any organization
can use to do bug coordination

169
00:14:52,292 --> 00:14:57,875
even if it's not there core DNA.
I quit my job at Alcomi and I
wanted to learn how to build

170
00:14:57,875 --> 00:15:03,083
public policy muscles and talk
to Congress so in January I
started as a CTO at Sonotype so

171
00:15:03,083 --> 00:15:08,542
I could actually drive more
security rigor into the software
supply chain. And the names are

172
00:15:08,542 --> 00:15:13,625
dozens. Morgan Naham has been
very prominently profiled is
working with people like cloudyo

173
00:15:13,625 --> 00:15:17,625
and the citizen lab to help
dissidence. We actually have
Gloria Spites because he liked

174
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:21,708
the Calvary to be more focused
on the surveillance state
problem or on civil liberties.

175
00:15:21,708 --> 00:15:26,083
And we share many same beliefs
and whatnot but we're going to
focus on different fronts and we

176
00:15:26,083 --> 00:15:30,375
amplify and congratulate his
effort and if that's in your
heart to do we're asking you to

177
00:15:30,375 --> 00:15:36,958
join our movement, we're asking
you to do something that impacts
your life. And then we're sad we

178
00:15:36,958 --> 00:15:42,125
can't watch it but we just met
three physicians who are also
hackers who right now on a

179
00:15:42,125 --> 00:15:47,667
different stage are presenting
how to undermine and the risks
in the 911 alert system because

180
00:15:47,667 --> 00:15:52,083
their concern as physicians is
can compromise patient care in
the ER and in their various

181
00:15:52,083 --> 00:15:58,125
perspective positions. That's a
quadian replicate. So we're
happy to see that that call

182
00:15:58,125 --> 00:16:03,542
spoke to people and lit
something in their hearts and
people like Zac Lynn Yame

183
00:16:03,542 --> 00:16:09,583
[indiscernible] built securely
to target the home IMT. >> So we
have a lot of other things we've

184
00:16:09,583 --> 00:16:14,000
accomplished this year and I
think personally you know, one
of the most rewarding things

185
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,750
that I was able to contribute to
within the calvaries was I was
invited outside the echo chamber

186
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:23,792
to give talks to people. One
specifically there was an event
the national association of real

187
00:16:23,792 --> 00:16:27,750
estate investment managers. I
can tell you it's very different
than DEF CON. They, I got in a

188
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:33,750
room with them and we were
talking about security, security
issues, risks to infrastructure,

189
00:16:35,958 --> 00:16:40,625
and literally it was about a 45
minute Q and A session and they
asked dozens and dozens of

190
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:44,792
questions about the large
buildings they're investing
millions or billions of dollars

191
00:16:44,792 --> 00:16:49,750
into that have internet of
things, technology in them, the
HVAC systems, the elevator

192
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:54,417
systems, the security systems,
the fire suppression systems are
all networked and they were very

193
00:16:54,417 --> 00:16:58,625
concerned about the security of
those devices. I wasn't actually
expecting that conversation to

194
00:16:58,625 --> 00:17:04,292
go that way. I was just asked to
give an update on the latest
threats, you know, targeting

195
00:17:04,292 --> 00:17:10,667
individuals and corporations and
it shifted very, very quickly to
internet of things and the

196
00:17:10,667 --> 00:17:17,875
infrastructure of large, large
skyscrapers in major cities. >>
And when we say conferences we

197
00:17:17,875 --> 00:17:21,250
don't mean the echo chamber.
Yes, we've been invited to speak
to some. We've participated in

198
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:27,708
shmookon, blue hat, absec USA
some of the larger, Derbycon
gave us room for our 100 person

199
00:17:27,708 --> 00:17:32,208
constitutional Congress last
September. In fact many of you
were there, two days of amazing

200
00:17:32,208 --> 00:17:35,958
collaboration and figuring out
what we wanted to do and how we
wanted to do it. But when we say

201
00:17:35,958 --> 00:17:43,167
this, an international cyber
treaty, and cyber security for
nation states was done at the

202
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:49,000
Hague, the closing key note for
Europe's National Cyber Security
Conference at the Hague was the

203
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,250
Cavalry. So for everyone that
says this isn't going to work
and no one's going to listen,

204
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:59,250
we're being invited to places
that we would never have dreamed
of being invited to before. And

205
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:06,417
in September I believe or
October, no actually November
the Cavalry made it to stage

206
00:18:06,417 --> 00:18:13,333
presence at TedEx. So my
mother-in-law and my neighbors
understand that we have risks in

207
00:18:13,333 --> 00:18:19,333
the things we depend upon in
technology. But the one that was
most mind boggling to me was

208
00:18:21,625 --> 00:18:27,958
government. I think most of us
think it's a corrupt intractable
impossible place to get anything

209
00:18:27,958 --> 00:18:33,958
done and that it's a bunch of
crusty old guys who think the
internet is a series of tubes. I

210
00:18:36,125 --> 00:18:41,292
am highly encouraged by that
group of people. I've done
personally, and there's other

211
00:18:41,292 --> 00:18:44,958
people in the audience who have
been pushing the Computer Fraud
and Abuse Act to reform. I

212
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:49,583
personally did over 70
congressional meetings since
January alone bringing technical

213
00:18:49,583 --> 00:18:55,583
literacy, an independent voice
for you, to Congress. And
they're listening. So I'm going

214
00:18:57,833 --> 00:19:03,292
to show that in a minute but I
have a proof point. >> So let's
talk a little bit about what

215
00:19:03,292 --> 00:19:09,125
worked well. Obviously the
mission statement that we've
pulled together, it resonated

216
00:19:09,125 --> 00:19:14,042
and it's all about timing as
well. I think many people have
tried and had similar

217
00:19:14,042 --> 00:19:21,000
conversations say five years ago
but the timing, it's right now,
this is the right time to go in

218
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:26,250
and talk to people about what
we're trying to do. It really,
really resonates with folks. >>

219
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:32,708
The four Cs was really the key.
It's not that we didn't have
talent it's that we didn't link

220
00:19:32,708 --> 00:19:37,167
it together in the chain towards
action and consequences, towards
results. We did not want to have

221
00:19:37,167 --> 00:19:41,417
random activity. We want to see
tangible results. I told the
press yesterday, we don't want

222
00:19:41,417 --> 00:19:48,000
to fix one flaw in one device
for one manufacturer. We want to
hack the incentive structure so

223
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,333
we can make all devices for a
particular industry more likely
to be designed safely than

224
00:19:52,333 --> 00:19:58,333
otherwise. >> We also, we also
learned that it takes a guild.
It's not all about researchers.

225
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:04,833
It's not all about the media.
It's about people working
together. Lots of folks who

226
00:20:04,833 --> 00:20:10,125
participated in the
Constitutional Congresses and
the various meet-ups who would

227
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:15,125
self proclaim that they're not
technical at all. But they have
background. They're lawyers they

228
00:20:15,125 --> 00:20:20,542
have backgrounds in public
policy. They have backgrounds in
PR and they're able to help work

229
00:20:20,542 --> 00:20:25,667
together like Josh said, help
slay the dragon. It's not just
going to be the deep technical

230
00:20:25,667 --> 00:20:28,625
folks who are going to be able
to do that on their own we need
everybody working together. And

231
00:20:28,625 --> 00:20:32,333
we need to learn that. >> Yes.
And Brian Keefer did and amazing
presentation on why it takes a

232
00:20:32,333 --> 00:20:37,833
guild using a world of word
craft as the carrying metaphor.
But one more point, I don't know

233
00:20:37,833 --> 00:20:42,875
what kind of class you are when
you do D&D or Warcraft or some
sort of game but we noticed we

234
00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:48,458
have a lot of assassins and I
found myself playing of role of
tank this year even though I'm

235
00:20:48,458 --> 00:20:54,125
not speced as one but we have
very, very few healers so as
we've done this journey so if

236
00:20:54,125 --> 00:21:00,083
you know any healers that would
like to roll one we definitely
need some. >> The other piece if

237
00:21:00,083 --> 00:21:05,958
finding people within our ranks
to educate us. And outside, yes.
People outside to come in and

238
00:21:05,958 --> 00:21:12,917
educate us. One of the, you know
Jen Ellis spent time doing
things like media training at

239
00:21:12,917 --> 00:21:18,417
Beside San Francisco. Speaking
to media is very, very hard.
Actually having a conversation

240
00:21:18,417 --> 00:21:21,708
with somebody just about
something is sometimes very
difficult when you know that

241
00:21:21,708 --> 00:21:26,292
they don't have the same
technical aptitude that you do
to be able to hone that message

242
00:21:26,292 --> 00:21:31,958
but also, sometimes you can be
asked questions when you are
speaking to media and it comes

243
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:35,625
off completely different when
the article's written and so
being able to learn how to hone

244
00:21:35,625 --> 00:21:40,375
your message, understand your
talking points was extremely
important and during those

245
00:21:40,375 --> 00:21:48,083
sessions I think it really,
really reigned in with who was
participating. >> Yep. And we

246
00:21:48,083 --> 00:21:52,375
really had fresh blood. So one
of the things that's problematic
around the echo chamber is our

247
00:21:52,375 --> 00:21:56,000
rock star culture. We tend to
put people up on pedestals and
you have to be a rock star and

248
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,333
you have to be extroverted and
you have to be entertaining.
There are unbelievably talented

249
00:22:00,333 --> 00:22:04,250
researchers that came to
Derbycon that we had never heard
of. They're very introverted and

250
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:10,042
they're very shy and in some
ways are as talented or more
than the people we put up on a

251
00:22:10,042 --> 00:22:13,750
pedestal. So we need to start
encouraging, incentivizing and
rewarding different kinds of

252
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:19,292
things. But as we started doing
this and we started hearing from
other people we also learned to

253
00:22:19,292 --> 00:22:23,750
reduce our jargon, stop using
such internal language and
internal speak. We got over the

254
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:30,958
word cyber. Cyber. Cyber. Cyber.
Right. If you want to talk to
the beltway you have to use that

255
00:22:30,958 --> 00:22:34,875
word right and if that makes us
[inaudible] to some of you we're
just going to have to take that

256
00:22:34,875 --> 00:22:39,250
lump. We have to hold our nose
and eat our lima beans because
if you want to communicate with

257
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:43,458
the people we wish to influence
we have to meet them at their
language, and in their terms and

258
00:22:43,458 --> 00:22:49,458
at their level. >> We were not
perfect. >> No. >> We actually
you know we actually said last

259
00:22:55,792 --> 00:22:58,750
year when we came on stage we
really didn't know where this
was going to go or what this was

260
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:04,417
going to end up being but one
thing we did learn if anybody,
you know anybody who does any

261
00:23:04,417 --> 00:23:09,792
type of project management or
project work for clients you
know that when the scope is

262
00:23:09,792 --> 00:23:14,583
extremely large or the scope
expands it becomes very
difficult to deliver. And what

263
00:23:14,583 --> 00:23:19,208
we learned early on is that
while we had sort of the three
pillars or the three planks of

264
00:23:19,208 --> 00:23:24,167
the platform of mind body and
soul, that was a little too
broad. And we began to really

265
00:23:24,167 --> 00:23:29,833
hone in and focus on body which
is also known as public safety
and human life. And when you

266
00:23:29,833 --> 00:23:34,500
think about that, that message
really, really resonates with
anybody. It doesn't necessarily

267
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:37,625
mean people in this room but if
you talk to somebody on the
street and ask if they're

268
00:23:37,625 --> 00:23:42,458
concerned with public safety and
human life in regards to
technology they're likely going

269
00:23:42,458 --> 00:23:48,542
to say yes and they're likely
going to start listening to you.
>> We've not given up on our

270
00:23:48,542 --> 00:23:52,417
fears that there's going to be
an increased criminalization
research. Many of you see it as

271
00:23:52,417 --> 00:23:57,458
an existential threat to what
you do. And there is a separate
initiative or two that I know of

272
00:23:57,458 --> 00:24:03,708
specifically working on CFAA to
make it more accommodating to
research. But in some of their

273
00:24:03,708 --> 00:24:08,292
initial experiments they were
basically told it's our right
and our First Amendment

274
00:24:08,292 --> 00:24:12,833
protected speech to research.
Now what do you think a Congress
person says to that? They say

275
00:24:12,833 --> 00:24:17,917
you guys sound like a bunch of
whiney brats. Like, what's in it
for my constituents? One of the

276
00:24:17,917 --> 00:24:24,458
really nice surprises is when we
led with the research happening
on medical devices or automotive

277
00:24:24,458 --> 00:24:28,917
safety which they did care about
either given their prior
backgrounds or what their

278
00:24:28,917 --> 00:24:33,083
constituents cared about or auto
industries in certain states
then they're at the edge of

279
00:24:33,083 --> 00:24:40,250
their seats and they're asking
how can you help us? What can we
do? Who can we work with? And

280
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:43,750
then you end with, well there's
a bit of a chilling effect
because there's the threat of

281
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:48,875
criminalization with really
vague laws written in 1984. So
it's really been the most

282
00:24:48,875 --> 00:24:54,500
resonant and as such, even
though it pained up to let go of
making those, you need to have a

283
00:24:54,500 --> 00:25:00,500
north star. >> Also project
management is not always very
easy as well. Anybody who's

284
00:25:03,375 --> 00:25:09,125
participating or helping out
with the cavalry also has day
jobs, and they have families and

285
00:25:09,125 --> 00:25:14,958
personal lives and this is a
grass roots volunteer effort. If
someone can give five minutes a

286
00:25:14,958 --> 00:25:19,542
month that's great. If someone
can give five hours a month
that's great as well. But

287
00:25:19,542 --> 00:25:23,375
running projects and trying to
accomplish things sometimes
becomes very, very difficult.

288
00:25:23,375 --> 00:25:27,625
Sometimes it's like herding
cats. I know we've had to have
several E-mail chains in order

289
00:25:27,625 --> 00:25:31,542
to try to get people on the
phone and there were always 2 or
3 people who couldn't make the

290
00:25:31,542 --> 00:25:37,833
call. That just happens. Moving
through and trying to take bite
size chunks instead of looking

291
00:25:37,833 --> 00:25:44,000
at this large project and build
accomplishments is something we
learned would work better in the

292
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,792
efforts we're trying to
accomplish. >> So just like we
need more healers, if you have

293
00:25:47,792 --> 00:25:54,583
project management skills or
know how to herd cats please,
please come help us. We've also

294
00:25:54,583 --> 00:25:59,667
had a very poor balance. We've
had some really harsh criticism
from some of our best friends

295
00:25:59,667 --> 00:26:06,750
that we're too holier than thou
or that we're not fixing
anything fast enough. That this

296
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:13,167
is doomed for failure. It took
nine months before we finally
said, you know if you're saying

297
00:26:13,167 --> 00:26:18,417
you're not doing anything if you
exclude teaching, teachers do
nothing and since we're mostly

298
00:26:18,417 --> 00:26:22,458
focused on education and
awareness outside the echo
chamber once we told them we had

299
00:26:22,458 --> 00:26:27,333
been to over 70 congressional
meetings or that we'd spent full
days with device manufacturers

300
00:26:27,333 --> 00:26:31,542
in industrial controls
environments for free, or that
we've been invited into

301
00:26:31,542 --> 00:26:35,625
automotive manufacturers to
discuss the unique nature of
embedded security that's

302
00:26:35,625 --> 00:26:39,708
different than enterprise
security, then they calm down.
But we've done a horrible,

303
00:26:39,708 --> 00:26:46,250
horrible job reporting back to
our friends what we've been
working on. >> So some of the

304
00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:51,667
surprises, we talked briefly
here, we mentioned this but it
goes beyond just the PR aspect

305
00:26:51,667 --> 00:26:57,958
of it. It's also the soft
skills. Professional media
training is one of those but

306
00:26:57,958 --> 00:27:03,083
communication empathy. Really
eliminating jargon. It's very,
very easy for any of us to have

307
00:27:03,083 --> 00:27:08,167
a conversation about a technical
topic. If you were to record our
conversation and play that back

308
00:27:08,167 --> 00:27:12,667
to someone who's not within our
industry they have no idea what
we're talking about and that's

309
00:27:12,667 --> 00:27:16,250
sometimes very difficult if
someone's trying to
communicating to a policy maker

310
00:27:16,250 --> 00:27:21,333
or an executive at a device
manufacturer because they're not
in this room, they're not in

311
00:27:21,333 --> 00:27:25,750
this community and they really
don't understand technology
terms and if you eliminate that

312
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:31,167
jargon and soften it it's
amazing how many light bulbs you
can get to go off in people's

313
00:27:31,167 --> 00:27:36,875
heads and you can able to
connect with them much better.
>> Yah, I suffer from empathy

314
00:27:36,875 --> 00:27:43,583
deficit disorder. I think many
of you may as well. And I had an
argument with Katie Misouris who

315
00:27:43,583 --> 00:27:50,042
has been unbelievably wonderful
part of the Calvary since pretty
much day one. She said Josh,

316
00:27:50,042 --> 00:27:56,125
what we lack is empathy. We
don't listen very well, we don't
think about who we're talking

317
00:27:56,125 --> 00:28:00,583
to. We don't understand the
dilemma and challenges that an
auto maker might have. And as

318
00:28:00,583 --> 00:28:05,833
such, we don't connect with them
and our advice is not useful to
them. And the thing that she

319
00:28:05,833 --> 00:28:09,458
said that really stuck with me
is, if we want to change the
world the first thing we need to

320
00:28:09,458 --> 00:28:17,000
change is ourselves. And it's
really shocking how the killer
app for this entire one year

321
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:23,792
initiative has been empathy.
Listening skills, communication
skills, mirroring, it's almost

322
00:28:23,792 --> 00:28:27,833
like if you took the social
engineering and took out the
malfeasance many of those skills

323
00:28:27,833 --> 00:28:33,500
have become critically necessary
and she was right. And she
really put us morally on the

324
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:38,250
right path that we need to look
and listen twice as much as we
speak and understand the

325
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:42,417
dilemmas of those people we're
talking to. And you know people
have been talking about this for

326
00:28:42,417 --> 00:28:46,833
a long time and we haven't taken
advantage of it. Jamie Erland
has been giving free workshops

327
00:28:46,833 --> 00:28:51,750
on presentation skills and soft
skill and I have been at certain
CONs where there's one person in

328
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:57,000
his audience. So he was right
and this makes him jaded. McCurl
has been doing this and he's

329
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:03,125
been right, he was just early.
So if you want to be more
effective, the huge surprise and

330
00:29:03,125 --> 00:29:06,667
huge delight is even though we
asked you to put some of your
heart and mind outside of your

331
00:29:06,667 --> 00:29:11,583
day job, the soft skills we've
developed have made us better
husbands and wives and have made

332
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:16,000
us more effective with our
bosses because we're learning to
talk on their level instead of

333
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:22,000
just complaining when they don't
listen. >> We have one more
fashion show today. Public

334
00:29:24,875 --> 00:29:28,542
policy. I thought this one was
going to be interesting and I
bet the farm on this, that's why

335
00:29:28,542 --> 00:29:36,250
I changed jobs to one I could go
work with Congress. I'm shocked
to see what we found. On my very

336
00:29:36,250 --> 00:29:43,458
first day of the very first try
I encountered a 27-year-old
working on the commerce

337
00:29:43,458 --> 00:29:50,333
committee in the office of
Senator Rockefeller and he
actually knew he was in the

338
00:29:50,333 --> 00:29:56,792
midst of writing a kill chain
analysis of the target breech on
par with anything that any one

339
00:29:56,792 --> 00:30:02,833
of you have written. I'd like to
say he's the anomaly but in many
of the offices of both the house

340
00:30:02,833 --> 00:30:07,667
and senate we found people of
our generation or millenials
understood this creative

341
00:30:07,667 --> 00:30:11,875
craftware and were asking
intelligent questions and can
tell fact from fud. And we're

342
00:30:11,875 --> 00:30:18,167
asking - I am highly encouraged
so for our second fashion show
I'd like to bring out to the

343
00:30:18,167 --> 00:30:24,042
stage counter evidence to the
idea that all that Congress
critters are grumpy old white

344
00:30:24,042 --> 00:30:28,875
guys. This is Andrew Ruffin.
Until a few weeks ago he was on
the Senate staff and now he's

345
00:30:28,875 --> 00:30:34,375
going back to grad school. He's
modeling a lovely attire.
[Applause] >> I have a token for

346
00:30:34,375 --> 00:30:40,375
you. Thank you. Finding people
like him gives me hope. They're
not going to necessarily find an

347
00:30:48,875 --> 00:30:54,583
oday in a home alarm system but
they understand the consequences
of it and they've really helped

348
00:30:54,583 --> 00:30:59,125
us to understand that this
public safety message is the one
that's going to most resonate

349
00:30:59,125 --> 00:31:05,125
and most push through what
looked like an intractable
problem. >> So the other piece

350
00:31:08,542 --> 00:31:14,917
here, the other surprise was
industry reception. I can tell
you last year when Josh and I

351
00:31:14,917 --> 00:31:21,042
were walking out and getting
ready to come on stage Sunday at
10:00 a.m. last year we said

352
00:31:21,042 --> 00:31:26,083
we're maybe going to get 30
people in the audience. Maybe if
we're lucky 50. And it was a

353
00:31:26,083 --> 00:31:31,375
room like this where there were
hundreds of people who came out
to hear what we had to say. And

354
00:31:31,375 --> 00:31:36,167
then after our talk hundreds of
people followed us into the
chill out lounge to continue the

355
00:31:36,167 --> 00:31:41,458
conversation for several hours
and the conversations continued
for weeks ahead. And so that was

356
00:31:41,458 --> 00:31:46,250
very, very shocking to us. >>
And what shouldn't be surprising
is these targets that we wanted

357
00:31:46,250 --> 00:31:50,250
to hit, it did surprise us but
it shouldn't, many of them are
already here at DEF CON they

358
00:31:50,250 --> 00:31:54,042
just didn't raise their hand or
try to stick out. There are auto
makers here right now. I talked

359
00:31:54,042 --> 00:31:59,500
to two of them last night. There
are people in medical device
companies who have been dying to

360
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:05,500
do the right thing but their
business doesn't listen to them.
They have mostly the right idea,

361
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:09,833
in some cases they have the
exact right idea but they needed
air cover and help and as we

362
00:32:09,833 --> 00:32:14,958
started getting media coverage
in the Guardian and Washington
Post and Wall Street Journal

363
00:32:14,958 --> 00:32:20,875
they can point at those to their
management chain and say I have
been asking this for three years

364
00:32:20,875 --> 00:32:24,167
it's finally in the published
consciousness. Can we finally
get in front of this? And the

365
00:32:24,167 --> 00:32:28,542
answer they're getting is yes.
There's a guy working in a
device manufacturing in Germany

366
00:32:28,542 --> 00:32:33,167
who every single time we have
mainstream media hit he gets a
new project approved. And I

367
00:32:33,167 --> 00:32:38,292
didn't even know this until a
month ago. So this is finding
willing teammates who will both

368
00:32:38,292 --> 00:32:43,583
get on a phone with us to tell
us where the bodies are buried
and what not to do. And we're

369
00:32:43,583 --> 00:32:48,042
actually able to help them get
done what they already wanted.
>> And the other surprise was

370
00:32:48,042 --> 00:32:53,625
the mission. Talking about human
life and public safety we found
instantly resonated with people

371
00:32:53,625 --> 00:32:58,208
who were in media and in policy.
Very different then taking the
message to them like Josh

372
00:32:58,208 --> 00:33:03,542
mentioned earlier, about trying
to - we're all about doing
security research and we want to

373
00:33:03,542 --> 00:33:08,125
change laws. When we talked
about human life and public
safety people listened. And that

374
00:33:08,125 --> 00:33:13,083
was something that was a
surprise as well. >> And a
recent proof point of this is on

375
00:33:13,083 --> 00:33:18,750
Tuesday this we had an invite
only 50 person event over at the
Four Seasons and we had medical

376
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:24,542
manufactures present, a law
professor from George Washington
University, a law professor and

377
00:33:24,542 --> 00:33:30,500
special counsel to the FTC who's
working on public policy work.
Some of the best researchers

378
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:36,583
like Billy Rios and Mark
Stanislav and we pulled the
right researchers for the right

379
00:33:36,583 --> 00:33:41,208
topics, we had the guy who
designed and implemented the
vehicle to vehicle protocol

380
00:33:41,208 --> 00:33:47,542
securely for 13 years. Not only
is it resonating, they flew all
the way out to Las Vegas for a

381
00:33:47,542 --> 00:33:52,625
meeting to build teams and
trust, a basis of trust that
they're going to then take into

382
00:33:52,625 --> 00:33:57,417
the next year together. This
isn't a hypothesis anymore. We
have tested the hypothesis and

383
00:33:57,417 --> 00:34:03,417
it is time. >> So people often
asked us, even last year I think
even leading up to this, what is

384
00:34:05,875 --> 00:34:09,417
the cavalry going to become? And
obviously the one thing we've
been thinking about and we've

385
00:34:09,417 --> 00:34:14,042
been thinking about very, very
hard is, what type of legal
entity should we become? Because

386
00:34:14,042 --> 00:34:18,083
there's advantages of becoming
various types of legal entities.
We can do more, we can extend

387
00:34:18,083 --> 00:34:23,583
our reach more. So some of the
choices we had were obviously
for profit, that's not something

388
00:34:23,583 --> 00:34:27,667
we're interested in. But then
there's the other 501
organizations. Things like

389
00:34:27,667 --> 00:34:32,792
professional organizations,
lobbying organizations and then
educational organizations and

390
00:34:32,792 --> 00:34:39,375
what we settled on is a 501C3
educational foundation. >> Yah,
this really is the path forward.

391
00:34:39,375 --> 00:34:47,000
If we only try to change policy
without getting hearts and minds
it's not going to work. And if

392
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:50,500
we only professionalize our
trade even though we're
anti-professionalization, that's

393
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:54,500
also not going to work. The real
bottle neck here is there aren't
enough people who understand the

394
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:59,125
implications of dependence on
technology that can put them in
harm's way. So we have to make

395
00:34:59,125 --> 00:35:03,000
some changes going forward.
Right now we're in active
negotiations to be adopted by a

396
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:08,583
large C3. If it does not come to
terms we're tired of waiting,
it's been one year and we'll

397
00:35:08,583 --> 00:35:12,875
file our own but this will give
us the ability to have tax
exempt status and take donations

398
00:35:12,875 --> 00:35:20,625
from anywhere, to drive public
service announcements, summits
with medical, auto, industrial

399
00:35:20,625 --> 00:35:26,167
controls and home automation
systems. So some of these
changes and we'll end with our

400
00:35:26,167 --> 00:35:30,458
announcement from yesterday,
some of the changes are, we want
to be much more self-service.

401
00:35:30,458 --> 00:35:35,750
When people ask us what can I do
to help? If we're not there to
manage them it's been a missed

402
00:35:35,750 --> 00:35:41,375
opportunity. So far the best
collaboration is someone says
can I come lead this effort? Or

403
00:35:41,375 --> 00:35:46,000
when Mark Sandinslav said we're
to start build it secure it dot
LY. So the go getters has been

404
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:50,208
easy but we're going to make it
easier for someone to grab a kit
and present at a local

405
00:35:50,208 --> 00:35:55,042
conference or get white papers,
or what not. We have to get
better communication

406
00:35:55,042 --> 00:36:00,250
transparency. But really it's
not, we don't want someone to
come to us and say what we can

407
00:36:00,250 --> 00:36:05,583
do for the cavalry? Instead we
want to flip it and we want to
say, here's what the Cavalry

408
00:36:05,583 --> 00:36:10,250
will do for you. So if our
mission focus is on public
safety and human life, any one

409
00:36:10,250 --> 00:36:15,333
of you that wants to do that is
going to get an entire polished
set of resources with

410
00:36:15,333 --> 00:36:19,667
connections to the right people
and media. With knowledge of the
landscape in Congress. With

411
00:36:19,667 --> 00:36:25,875
relationships at the FDA or FTC.
Beau and I just met with the FDA
last week and we're going to go

412
00:36:25,875 --> 00:36:30,000
again. In fact we're going to do
a siren boot camp for
Congressional staffers at the

413
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:36,542
end of August. Anyone who wants
to help in any single way great
but if we can help you amplify

414
00:36:36,542 --> 00:36:40,292
your message and get your
message to the right people or
the right introductions, we'd

415
00:36:40,292 --> 00:36:45,500
like to do so. We need to be
more service oriented. >> So
this happened yesterday. You may

416
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:51,167
have seen news about it. This is
the front page in the technology
section of Reuters and it has

417
00:36:51,167 --> 00:36:55,833
hacking group wants to play nice
with auto makers. And if you
actually read that article you

418
00:36:55,833 --> 00:37:00,208
would see that we announced
yesterday we've released an open
letter to the auto industry on

419
00:37:00,208 --> 00:37:03,917
collaborating for safety. So
we're going to talk a little bit
about that. We only have a

420
00:37:03,917 --> 00:37:08,458
couple of minutes left. But one
of the big things, if you go to
the Cavalry.org website,

421
00:37:08,458 --> 00:37:12,833
IamtheCavalry.org website you
can see more details on this and
there's also a call to action

422
00:37:12,833 --> 00:37:17,875
for you which we'll talk about
in a minute. But we announced
within that letter the five star

423
00:37:17,875 --> 00:37:23,375
automotive cyber safety program.
And there's five points, five
stars to that program, it's

424
00:37:23,375 --> 00:37:28,667
safety by design, third party
collaboration, evidence capture,
security updates and

425
00:37:28,667 --> 00:37:35,042
segmentation isolation. >> These
are critical capacities. These
are not going to be a PCI list.

426
00:37:35,042 --> 00:37:41,583
Checklists don't work. This
isn't going to be telling them
what to do and how to do it.

427
00:37:41,583 --> 00:37:47,042
These are five foundational
capabilities we think every car
manufacturer is going to need to

428
00:37:47,042 --> 00:37:52,750
have and we'll help them
interpret, define and attest to
them. Number one, we recognize

429
00:37:52,750 --> 00:37:56,875
safety is important to our
customers as such we've
published an overview of our

430
00:37:56,875 --> 00:38:01,875
security software development
life cycle for how we design,
develop, test our products and

431
00:38:01,875 --> 00:38:07,167
our supply chain. So tell us
what you're doing to factor
security into your design.

432
00:38:07,167 --> 00:38:11,667
Number 2, you'll like this one.
We know we're going to miss
things so we invite the

433
00:38:11,667 --> 00:38:15,500
participation of third party
researchers acting in goodwill
with our published coordinated

434
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:19,958
disclosure policy. How would you
like to avoid 12 years of
adversarial relationship with

435
00:38:19,958 --> 00:38:27,875
the auto industry? Number 3.
Failures will happen so we need
to actually study and understand

436
00:38:27,875 --> 00:38:31,958
and learn from our failures
therefore we're asking for
tamper evident forensically

437
00:38:31,958 --> 00:38:35,792
sound evidence capture. Now this
is not plain speak for my
neighbor, but think in terms of

438
00:38:35,792 --> 00:38:40,875
a black box. You cannot
simultaneously claim there's no
evidence of hacking when you

439
00:38:40,875 --> 00:38:45,583
lack the ability to capture any
evidence of hacking. So this has
to be in place going forward.

440
00:38:45,583 --> 00:38:51,583
4th. Secure updates. Imagine
heart bleed in your car
unpatchable. Would it scare you

441
00:38:55,375 --> 00:38:59,792
to know several manufacturers
use vulnerable versions of open
source components and their

442
00:38:59,792 --> 00:39:04,792
remote connectivity? We have to
be better and we're going to
start being better. So the

443
00:39:04,792 --> 00:39:10,458
ability to update your software.
Lastly segmentation and
isolation. We believe that there

444
00:39:10,458 --> 00:39:13,750
should be - oh I was listening
to the [inaudible] too much, but
you've got to keep them

445
00:39:13,750 --> 00:39:18,958
separated right? You need to
have separation of critical
systems that affect life, like

446
00:39:18,958 --> 00:39:24,500
your braking, your steering
column, your air bag, from
systems like infotainment,

447
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:30,125
noncritical systems. A hack of
your stereo through your blue
tooth should never disable your

448
00:39:30,125 --> 00:39:34,167
brakes. And unfortunately
through shared circuitry like on
a can bus, right now they're

449
00:39:34,167 --> 00:39:38,125
sharing the same circuitry, the
same memory map. And we really
want to see [inaudible] of what

450
00:39:38,125 --> 00:39:41,708
logical and physical isolation
techniques they're using. And
again we're going to help them

451
00:39:41,708 --> 00:39:47,250
to do so. So if any of you have
driven a car, ridden in a car or
intend to ride in a car we would

452
00:39:47,250 --> 00:39:51,583
like you to go to the following
site and sign. >> So if you
visit this site, it's a bitly

453
00:39:51,583 --> 00:39:58,833
link five star auto, so
bitly/fivestarauto. Put it in
your phone now, everybody in

454
00:39:58,833 --> 00:40:05,000
this room take five minutes
after the presentation, read the
letter, read the petition and

455
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:10,042
sign it. We need everybody in
this room's support. >> I know
you're going to be concerned

456
00:40:10,042 --> 00:40:15,083
about privacy. I love privacy.
You can fill out that change
order thing even though it asks

457
00:40:15,083 --> 00:40:21,417
you a few simple questions. I
love privacy, I'd like to be
alive to enjoy it. >> In all

458
00:40:21,417 --> 00:40:26,958
seriousness in the last few
moments here some people think
this is a waste of time, it's

459
00:40:26,958 --> 00:40:31,750
not going to work. I'm willing
to try and waste my time. And I
hope you are too. Some people

460
00:40:31,750 --> 00:40:37,750
think nothing will get better
until we have accidents, bad
outcomes, dead babies. I hope

461
00:40:41,417 --> 00:40:46,750
they're wrong. But here's the
deal. We can either wait for
these catastrophic triggering

462
00:40:46,750 --> 00:40:54,083
events because we always have a
sane and rational response to
catastrophic events right? So

463
00:40:54,083 --> 00:40:59,167
rather than avoiding like the
polarizing emotional ones Andrea
reminds us that the Cuyahoga

464
00:40:59,167 --> 00:41:05,417
River in Ohio had to catch on
fire and stay on fire before
very aggressive major laws were

465
00:41:05,417 --> 00:41:13,083
put in place to do something.
Twice. So before we have our
cyber Cuyahoga moment we believe

466
00:41:13,083 --> 00:41:18,208
that if we start the education
and start the collaboration now
and we raise the threat IQ of

467
00:41:18,208 --> 00:41:22,917
policy makers, then that knee
jerk will be slightly less
severe. So if you think we're

468
00:41:22,917 --> 00:41:28,875
early we've chosen that now is
the time to start. And the last
note I'll say is attitude is

469
00:41:28,875 --> 00:41:34,667
everything. I'm going to remind
you what we said at the
beginning. At my first DEF CON

470
00:41:34,667 --> 00:41:42,000
the defining characteristic of
this demographic, our zeitgeist
was curiosity. We passionately

471
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:47,958
loved to figure out how things
worked. When I walked around
last year it was cynicism and

472
00:41:47,958 --> 00:41:53,958
defeat. Cynicism is a choice.
And for many reasons we've come
to that point. But we can choose

473
00:41:56,375 --> 00:42:00,500
to do something that gives us
fulfillment and purpose and we
can choose that the timing is

474
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:06,458
right and we can choose to hit
reset. It's not going to be for
everybody. If you want to watch

475
00:42:06,458 --> 00:42:12,250
us fail, that's fine but you
have a choice about your
attitude and I would encourage

476
00:42:12,250 --> 00:42:17,917
you that the timing is now.
People are ready. The
consequences are severe so

477
00:42:17,917 --> 00:42:24,750
please choose wisely. >> So how
can you get involved? One of the
big things is if you have the

478
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:30,083
opportunity you can get a job in
the target industry. Medical
device manufacturers are looking

479
00:42:30,083 --> 00:42:34,083
for security people. Automotive
industry is looking for security
people. You can get jobs there.

480
00:42:34,083 --> 00:42:37,833
Innovative things companies are
looking for security people.
There's plenty of startup

481
00:42:37,833 --> 00:42:43,042
companies popping up left and
right that need security people
to work for them. You can

482
00:42:43,042 --> 00:42:46,875
research some of the target
technologies. If you have that
choice between a mobile device

483
00:42:46,875 --> 00:42:51,958
or a medical device, choose the
medical device. You can speak at
target industry events. And

484
00:42:51,958 --> 00:42:56,375
that's not DEF CON, that's not
Black Hat, that's not besides.
That's medical device

485
00:42:56,375 --> 00:43:02,000
manufacturing events. That's
internet things types of events.
Automotive conferences. You can

486
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:06,208
speak at those conferences.
They're looking for people to
speak on security. And then you

487
00:43:06,208 --> 00:43:11,625
can help educate policy makers
and media. When you have an
opportunity to speak to those

488
00:43:11,625 --> 00:43:18,875
individuals you can explain the
risks and explain it in clear
easy to understand language so

489
00:43:18,875 --> 00:43:24,583
that the message is clear and
broadcasted to the public in the
right way. And of course you can

490
00:43:24,583 --> 00:43:29,083
join the mailing list. If you
want to become and active,
active member or participant,

491
00:43:29,083 --> 00:43:32,667
join the mailing list or visit
the website and Beau Woods has
done an amazing job over the

492
00:43:32,667 --> 00:43:37,333
last several months building a
website that has clear messaging
on it and information and it's

493
00:43:37,333 --> 00:43:43,333
just going to grow as we have
bodies of evidence to publish
and place on that site. So the

494
00:43:45,333 --> 00:43:51,333
Cavalry isn't coming so it falls
to us. It fall to you. Can I
hear an I am the cavalry? Can I

495
00:43:56,917 --> 00:44:02,917
hear I am the cavalry? Oh. I am
the cavalry. Thank you for
caring and thank you for giving

496
00:44:10,292 --> 00:44:16,292
us that ear of experimentation.
So I think should we do another
year? Should we? [Applause] >>

497
00:44:21,083 --> 00:44:23,250
All right. Thank you. >> Thank
you. >> I don't know. So if
anybody has questions for these

498
00:44:23,250 --> 00:44:25,625
fine gentlemen we're going to
escort them out to the foyer and
you will be able to talk to them

499
00:44:25,625 --> 00:44:27,625
out there.
