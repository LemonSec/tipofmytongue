1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:04,500
>> Yeah, alright. Thanks
everbody for coming, it is super
exciting to be here. It's been a

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:10,458
few years since I had a talk
here at DEF CON and it's great
to be back. I'm Michael Ossmann

3
00:00:10,458 --> 00:00:15,792
of Great Scott Gadgets and I
make hardware for hackers. I
spend my time completely devoted

4
00:00:15,792 --> 00:00:21,792
to building open source hardware
primarily for the information
security community and for other

5
00:00:25,542 --> 00:00:33,208
innovative people. So this is
the NSA play set RF
retroreflectors. Hopefully some

6
00:00:33,208 --> 00:00:39,750
of you have noticed this is not
the only NSA play set talk on
the schedule. Some of my cohorts

7
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:47,625
are in the front row here, they
have talks coming up soon. The
concept of the NSA play set is

8
00:00:47,625 --> 00:00:53,625
now that the catalog has leaked
and it leaked last winter, we in
the open security community

9
00:00:55,625 --> 00:01:01,625
suddenly have a glimpse of what
the NSA uses or at least in some
cases, their hardware and

10
00:01:03,667 --> 00:01:09,667
software as attack tools and the
implants, hopefully some of you
have seen, the concept of the

11
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:18,250
NSA play set is now that we know
those things, let's build them
ourselves. Let's create similar

12
00:01:20,958 --> 00:01:24,792
capabilities using open source
hardware and open source
software, anything off the

13
00:01:24,792 --> 00:01:30,958
shelf, anything that is readily
available, very accessible, try
to make this stuff easy to use

14
00:01:30,958 --> 00:01:36,958
and try to raise awareness about
the security implications that
‑‑ of these technologies

15
00:01:39,292 --> 00:01:46,125
existing at all. I gave a talk
with Dean Pierce, who's in the
front row here at tour camp, the

16
00:01:46,125 --> 00:01:52,292
URL is up there, you might be
able to read it, the color is a
little off, but most of my

17
00:01:52,292 --> 00:01:58,375
slides are black and white
anyway, so who cares. If you're
interested in a little bit of a

18
00:01:58,375 --> 00:02:04,333
background in the NSA play set
and a broad overview of what is
in the ANT catalog and how we

19
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:11,583
think these things can be made
in the open community, that's
the best place to start, that's

20
00:02:11,583 --> 00:02:17,917
the introduction talk to the
series. And this weekend here at
DEF CON, a number of us are

21
00:02:17,917 --> 00:02:25,417
doing talks on specific parts of
the NSA play set. Today I'm
talking about RF

22
00:02:25,417 --> 00:02:32,083
retroreflectors. And last night,
by the way, how many of you were
at the EFF Summit? The Summit

23
00:02:32,083 --> 00:02:38,083
last night? Yeah? Really? That's
it? At the Summit, I know a lot
of you were there and a bunch of

24
00:02:43,208 --> 00:02:49,208
us from the NSA play set donated
a whole bunch of hardware. We
made this cool play set bucket,

25
00:02:52,958 --> 00:03:00,000
it has hack RF's [indiscernible]
in it,it has IME's, PCI express
attack tools, thunderbolt attack

26
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,000
tools, it has a hard drive full
of rainbow tables for GSM on and
on and on, a huge kit. And it

27
00:03:10,375 --> 00:03:17,083
went for $2,250 in the auction
last night. So thanks to
everyone who contributed.  	>>

28
00:03:17,083 --> 00:03:23,958
[Applause].  	>> And who bid on
it. Is the winner of the auction
here? No? Well, I'd like to

29
00:03:23,958 --> 00:03:31,250
shake your hand at some point.
That was pretty amazing that we
were able to pull together and

30
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:37,250
do that. So my talk today is on
RF retroreflectors, similar to
those that are in the ANT

31
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:43,250
catalog, and an RF
retroreflector, and I never
heard the term RF retroreflector

32
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:52,500
before the amp catalog leaked,
so I have kind of adopted it,
but it's a little implant that

33
00:03:56,792 --> 00:04:02,792
modulates an incoming radio
signal and reflects it back to
the radar device illuminating

34
00:04:05,667 --> 00:04:11,667
it. So the attacker is on the
left, it fires a radio wave at
the target. The target has a

35
00:04:13,917 --> 00:04:19,917
little implant that reflects the
radio wave back to the radar
unit being used by the attacker.

36
00:04:22,083 --> 00:04:28,125
The process of irradiating a
target is often called
illumination, think of it as

37
00:04:28,125 --> 00:04:32,833
shining a light on the target,
except the light happens to be
radio wavelengths instead of

38
00:04:32,833 --> 00:04:38,875
visible wavelengths. Otherwise
it's the same thing. You are
shining a radar beam at a

39
00:04:38,875 --> 00:04:44,375
target, illuminating it and
seeing what gets reflected back.
And then the implant is some

40
00:04:44,375 --> 00:04:51,292
very small device that is
designed to modulate the
reflection. And this can be done

41
00:04:51,292 --> 00:04:56,708
at extremely low power, which is
one of the reasons that this
approach is useful. It can be

42
00:04:56,708 --> 00:05:02,708
done with no battery, for
example. It can be completely
powered just by the radio wave

43
00:05:05,458 --> 00:05:11,458
itself. So it's a super simple
kind of implant design that is
very low power and uses a very

44
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:21,625
small number of components. So
it can be tiny and it can be
without any local battery

45
00:05:21,625 --> 00:05:27,833
source. So that's the kind of
thing I'm talking about today. I
kind of wanted to set the record

46
00:05:27,833 --> 00:05:34,625
straight a little bit. One of my
earlier talks got some press and
some people were writing that I

47
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:41,958
was reverse engineering tools in
the NSA AMP catalog and I don't
think that's actually correct. I

48
00:05:41,958 --> 00:05:49,333
don't have any devices from the
NSA. I don't have any inside
knowledge of devices used by the

49
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:55,000
NSA. All I have is the
information that's this the
public leaked amp catalog that

50
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:01,750
anyone can find leaked on the
Internet. So I'm not really, I
don't really feel that I'm

51
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:07,458
reverse engineering the NSA's
tools. I'm forward engineering
tools that have similar

52
00:06:07,458 --> 00:06:14,292
capabilities to those that the
NSA uses. And hopefully this
will help us in the open

53
00:06:14,292 --> 00:06:19,875
community create a set of tools
that we can use to research this
kind of capability and find out

54
00:06:19,875 --> 00:06:24,875
how it works and how well it
works and what the implications
are and whether or not these

55
00:06:24,875 --> 00:06:30,042
things can be made much ‑‑ in
the future, much more
sophisticated than we know of

56
00:06:30,042 --> 00:06:37,458
now. So in this talk I will
cover leaked classified
information from the amp

57
00:06:37,458 --> 00:06:42,083
catalog. I don't think I've put
any screenshots in here from the
amp catalog, but I'm going to

58
00:06:42,083 --> 00:06:49,000
talk about things that I
observed from the amp catalog.
So if you don't want to hear

59
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:54,042
about leaked, classified
information, you can leave now.
Anyone for a game of spot the

60
00:06:54,042 --> 00:07:00,042
Fed? I am going to show you in
this talk a few hardware designs
for my own retroreflectors and

61
00:07:05,292 --> 00:07:09,250
I'm going to tell you how to
build your own retroreflector
right here at DEF CON, if you

62
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:16,000
want. I'm also going to do a
live demonstration. And really
kind of the reason I'm doing all

63
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:23,083
of this is to lure you here so
that you can listen to me rant
about the state of emissions

64
00:07:23,083 --> 00:07:29,083
security. Emission security is
the field of security where we
study emissions from devices and

65
00:07:36,292 --> 00:07:43,125
a fair bit is known in the
public research community, the
hacker community, about passive

66
00:07:43,125 --> 00:07:49,125
attacks. But not very much has
been known historically about
active attacks. And today I'm

67
00:07:51,208 --> 00:07:58,542
talking specifically about
active attacks, where an
attacker actually transmits

68
00:07:58,542 --> 00:08:04,542
something towards the target.
The passive attacks that we know
about, you may have heard the

69
00:08:08,292 --> 00:08:15,750
code name tempest. And sometimes
people apply the word tempest to
all emission security, but

70
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:20,958
really it's a code name that
relates specifically to
unintentional emissions. Now

71
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:26,000
there are all kinds of different
unintentional emissions, there
are RF emissions, there are

72
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:32,750
conducted electrical emissions,
thermal emissions, audio, all
kinds of things. There are all

73
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:37,542
these different little side
channels where somebody might be
able to pick up some kind of

74
00:08:37,542 --> 00:08:45,000
unintentional emission and from
that information figure out
something about the state of the

75
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:51,083
target and in some cases figure
out extreme information about
the state of the target, like

76
00:08:51,083 --> 00:08:57,542
reproducing what's on a video
screen or capturing key strokes
and so forth. So there's a fair

77
00:08:57,542 --> 00:09:04,750
amount of research in the area
of passive emissions security
attacks. And if you want to get

78
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:09,417
started reading about these
things, probably the best place
to start would be the writings

79
00:09:09,417 --> 00:09:15,417
of Marcus Coone. I do think
there is quite a bit of
opportunity in the field of

80
00:09:17,667 --> 00:09:23,583
passive emissions security for
future research. There are lots
of things that unexplored at

81
00:09:23,583 --> 00:09:29,708
this time. However, we at least
have a little bit of information
and a little bit of public

82
00:09:29,708 --> 00:09:37,125
research and you can find
papers. That's not true so much
for active attacks: Active

83
00:09:37,125 --> 00:09:45,042
attacks, the main thing that
we've known about for years is
that everybody always talks

84
00:09:45,042 --> 00:09:52,375
about being the prime example of
active emissions security is the
thing, the great seal bug. This

85
00:09:52,375 --> 00:09:59,125
was a bug that was discovered
inside a wooden carving of the
great seal of the United States

86
00:09:59,125 --> 00:10:05,125
in the U.S. embassy in Moscow
and information about this bug
was released publicly in 1960.

87
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:14,875
It was supposedly discovered in
the early 50s and may have been
implanted as early as 1945. So

88
00:10:18,375 --> 00:10:24,875
this is ‑‑ this is technology
from the mid to early 40s. And
it's an incredibly simple

89
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:30,875
device. It consists of a
microphone and an antenna, and
that's it. It doesn't have any

90
00:10:37,792 --> 00:10:43,792
active components whatsoever. It
simply is a condenser mic, which
is a capacitor that changes its

91
00:10:45,792 --> 00:10:52,500
capacitance based on the air
pressure. And that is connected
to an antenna in such a way that

92
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:58,500
the air pressure, the changes in
the air pressure modulates the
impedance connected and that

93
00:11:04,875 --> 00:11:12,167
modulates a reflection that
comes back to a radar unit that
is illuminating this device. In

94
00:11:12,167 --> 00:11:18,167
some ways it's very difficult to
detect because it's not active
most of the time. If you looked

95
00:11:23,167 --> 00:11:28,333
around to try to see, like
before a big meeting, if you
went around looking for any bugs

96
00:11:28,333 --> 00:11:32,792
that were transmitting, you
would pick up nothing from this
thing, but once the meeting

97
00:11:32,792 --> 00:11:37,750
starts, then your attacker
starts illuminating the device
with the radar, then suddenly it

98
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:43,750
is active. And it uses no power,
no local power supply
whatsoever. And it's a pretty

99
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:54,083
incredible invention for the
time. The next thing I think
everybody has heard about now

100
00:11:57,792 --> 00:12:03,333
since we have had these RF
retroreflectors in the amp
catalog, what happened between

101
00:12:03,333 --> 00:12:09,333
the thing and the amp catalog,
we have 53 years of rumor and
speculation. And I wish I was

102
00:12:13,417 --> 00:12:21,208
exaggerating. But really if you
look for hard evidence, if you
look for example designs, if you

103
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:27,167
look for somebody who did an
actual experiment to show how an
active emissions security attack

104
00:12:27,167 --> 00:12:33,167
works, you'll find almost
nothing between 1960 and 2013.
It is such an unbelievable gap.

105
00:12:38,125 --> 00:12:44,292
We are decades behind the
intelligence agencies in our
basic understanding in threats

106
00:12:44,292 --> 00:12:51,792
against our own systems. Now
some people will argue with me,
some people will say otherwise,

107
00:12:51,792 --> 00:12:58,625
they will say, oh, I know all
about these active attacks and
they will rattle off code words

108
00:12:58,625 --> 00:13:04,625
and mention declassified
documents and, you know, I say
to them, BOCGGOFO. Because,

109
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:14,083
yeah, we've had a lot of hints,
we've had a lot of hints from
declassified documents over the

110
00:13:14,083 --> 00:13:20,083
years. We have had a lot of
speculation, but show me the one
place where someone has done a

111
00:13:22,292 --> 00:13:28,625
research paper, show me the one
place somebody has given a
conference talk, released a

112
00:13:28,625 --> 00:13:33,750
hardware design, done an
experiment, published the
results. And I personally have

113
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:39,917
not found any. I would love if
somebody ran up here and proved
me wrong. That would be amazing.

114
00:13:39,917 --> 00:13:47,167
I've been looking, but I have
not found it. Now one thing I
found, a brief mention in the

115
00:13:47,167 --> 00:13:53,167
paper Soft Tempest by Marcus
Coone and Ross Anderson, they do
mention an attack where a

116
00:13:56,250 --> 00:14:04,042
keyboard cable, a computer
keyboard cable was irradiated
and key presses were detected by

117
00:14:04,042 --> 00:14:11,417
the return from that cable. Now
this I would put in the category
of rumor and speculation because

118
00:14:11,417 --> 00:14:17,417
it is one brief mention in paper
about other things. And it comes
from a declassified German

119
00:14:19,833 --> 00:14:25,833
document. As far as I know, no
one has actually tested this in
a public experiment. And one of

120
00:14:29,167 --> 00:14:35,125
the interesting things here is
that this is apparently
irradiating or illuminating an

121
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:42,125
unmodified keyboard and cable.
Unmodified, no implant was
intentionally installed in the

122
00:14:42,125 --> 00:14:48,125
target. The equipment, out of
the box, was vulnerable to this
attack, which is quite

123
00:14:51,375 --> 00:14:58,042
interesting to me. And there
were some hints in the amp
catalog that suggests similar

124
00:14:58,042 --> 00:15:04,042
attacks are possible on other
things. For example, there's a
VGA video implant that is

125
00:15:06,375 --> 00:15:14,042
retroreflector for picking up
the video signal. And on the
page describing that implant, it

126
00:15:14,042 --> 00:15:20,542
says that it provides an
enhanced return, which suggests
to me that they get some kind of

127
00:15:20,542 --> 00:15:26,542
return sometimes from VGA cables
without enhancing it. That's
very interesting, I think. Post

128
00:15:28,917 --> 00:15:34,917
ant catalog, just this year,
there have been some public, on
YouTube, some experiments that

129
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:44,250
this one person, GGPPR has
posted, so I recommend you check
those out. As far as I know, he

130
00:15:46,542 --> 00:15:52,542
and I are the only playing with
this stuff and talking about it
publicly. So today I'm releasing

131
00:15:54,792 --> 00:16:00,417
open source hardware design for
actual implants and I'm teaching
you how you can build them

132
00:16:00,417 --> 00:16:06,583
yourself and how simple they
are. And I'm going to do a live
demonstration on stage, which

133
00:16:06,583 --> 00:16:12,583
hopefully will work. And I
mentioned just a second ago that
there may be capabilities, maybe

134
00:16:16,833 --> 00:16:22,083
possibilities of making this
kind of retroreflector attack
work without actually implanting

135
00:16:22,083 --> 00:16:27,167
a target. And so I would
consider that a case where we
have an unintentional

136
00:16:27,167 --> 00:16:33,542
retroreflector, which is my
bottom row there. There's also a
case where we have an

137
00:16:33,542 --> 00:16:39,042
intentional retroreflector,
where we have some kind of
implant we install in the

138
00:16:39,042 --> 00:16:45,875
target. And then there are other
cases in these columns. What I'm
doing today is I'm intentionally

139
00:16:45,875 --> 00:16:53,042
illuminating, firing a radio
wave at the target. But there
are also other cases where a

140
00:16:53,042 --> 00:17:00,542
target could be unintentionally
illuminated. For example,
everybody is walking around

141
00:17:00,542 --> 00:17:06,542
carrying mobile phones that put
out far more radio energy than
my test system up here. So if

142
00:17:10,792 --> 00:17:16,583
people ‑‑ so if you're walking
near a device that is vulnerable
to this or is implanted so that

143
00:17:16,583 --> 00:17:23,917
it's vulnerable to
retroreflection, then you may be
unintentionally illuminating it

144
00:17:23,917 --> 00:17:29,917
and causing it to create a
reflection that an attacker can
pick up. And these types of

145
00:17:32,917 --> 00:17:39,667
attacks, you know, we've seen
hints of, we've heard rumors
about, but I don't know of any

146
00:17:39,667 --> 00:17:46,583
research into any of these
categories really, I don't know
of any publicly demonstrated

147
00:17:46,583 --> 00:17:53,375
experiment‑like ‑‑ expect for
what I'm doing today, just in
that one category. So this is a

148
00:17:53,375 --> 00:17:58,833
wide open research area. There's
a lot of opportunity. And what
I'm doing today is scratching

149
00:17:58,833 --> 00:18:04,833
the surface of that one square
in the grid. A quick note about
the term retroreflector. In the

150
00:18:08,042 --> 00:18:14,625
ant catalog it's spelled with a
hyphen, but I don't know why
because you look around at other

151
00:18:14,625 --> 00:18:20,125
literature, you'll find that
it's actually a fairly common
technical term without the

152
00:18:20,125 --> 00:18:24,875
hyphen. So I have adopted it
without the hyphen, because that
seems to be the common usage

153
00:18:24,875 --> 00:18:31,500
every why other than the NSA.
But I am adopting the term
retroreflector, which is a

154
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:38,500
little bit of a stretch maybe.
The word retroreflector means
reflecting something back to

155
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:45,208
it's source ‑‑ for example, when
you are driving down the highway
at night and you're headlights

156
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:53,042
hit the roadsign the roadsigns
have a retroreflecting coating
on them so most of your light

157
00:18:53,042 --> 00:19:00,083
from your headlight comes back
to you and the road signs look
very bright. But somebody

158
00:19:00,083 --> 00:19:06,792
standing off to the side of the
road who is not back near the
source of light, doesn't see the

159
00:19:06,792 --> 00:19:12,958
road sign illuminating so
brightly because of that
retroreflective surface that

160
00:19:12,958 --> 00:19:20,667
somehow reflects that light back
towards the source that it came
from. And this technology, if

161
00:19:20,667 --> 00:19:27,292
you want to see a really cool
application of that, optical
retroreflection, the cast AR

162
00:19:27,292 --> 00:19:33,292
project is doing wonderful
augmented reality sort of system
that takes advantage of that

163
00:19:38,625 --> 00:19:44,417
type of optical retroreflection.
So a radio retroreflector, in my
opinion, would reflect most of

164
00:19:44,417 --> 00:19:49,458
the energy back towards the
source. And that doesn't
actually appear to be what the

165
00:19:49,458 --> 00:19:55,333
devices in the ant catalog are
doing. They appear to be using
very small, not very directional

166
00:19:55,333 --> 00:20:01,042
antenna. And so they're
reflecting, yes, but they are
kind of scattering energy in a

167
00:20:01,042 --> 00:20:06,833
lot of directions and not
particularly back towards to the
source. Now with bigger, more

168
00:20:06,833 --> 00:20:12,667
sophisticate antennasin the
implant they could be more
retroflective. So, just be aware

169
00:20:12,667 --> 00:20:18,583
that that term is used a little
bit loosely here but I've
adopted the term RF

170
00:20:18,583 --> 00:20:24,583
retroreflector just because
that's what they are called in
the ant catolog. If you want to

171
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:36,750
find out more about how this
method works, then back scatter
is probably more the search term

172
00:20:41,417 --> 00:20:47,708
you would want to use instead of
retroreflector. There's a lot of
public research on RF back

173
00:20:47,708 --> 00:20:54,417
scatter communication. Can
anybody tell me the year of the
first paper on RF back scatter

174
00:20:54,417 --> 00:21:00,417
communication? Anybody know did?
Nobody? I'll give you a free
retroreflector.  	>> [Off mic].

175
00:21:07,417 --> 00:21:15,125
 	>> I didn't hear it. Sorry,
guys.  	>> [Off mic].  	>> 1948.
1948 there was a paper called

176
00:21:15,125 --> 00:21:21,125
Communication by Means of
Reflective Power. And realize
this was after the thing was

177
00:21:23,708 --> 00:21:29,708
deployed. So the very first
public research paper on this
means of RF retroreflection or

178
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:39,167
RF back scatter communication
didn't happen until well after
the thing was deployed. So that

179
00:21:39,167 --> 00:21:46,542
thing was a pretty cool
invention for its time. Now
there was research into optical

180
00:21:46,542 --> 00:21:52,000
back scatter prior to this but
this is the first paper I can
find on RF back scatter. There's

181
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:58,083
a lot more research over the
years since 1948. And in
particular, over the last couple

182
00:21:58,083 --> 00:22:04,750
of decades, if you look for any
UHF RFID technology, UHF is a
range of frequencies that is

183
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:10,750
used by the RFID tags that get
longer distance, longer range.
The really close range, the

184
00:22:12,792 --> 00:22:20,125
stuff that you have to have very
close proximity for is down in
the low‑frequency, LF or HF. UHF

185
00:22:20,125 --> 00:22:26,458
RFID tags are a little more
similar to the type of things
I'm using and the NSA seems to

186
00:22:26,458 --> 00:22:32,708
be using. In fact, most of the
NSA implant seem to be working
in the UHF band. So if you look

187
00:22:32,708 --> 00:22:40,250
at designs for the UHFRIDF tags,
they are very similar to the
type of design you would want to

188
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:46,875
use for building a
retroreflector. Now I have to
have a retroreflector, but I

189
00:22:46,875 --> 00:22:52,417
also have to have radar system.
I have to have a means of firing
a radar beam or illuminating a

190
00:22:52,417 --> 00:22:58,583
target and picking up the return
from that target. There's plenty
of off the she have radar gear,

191
00:22:58,583 --> 00:23:05,417
a lot of it is pretty expensive
but you can find things like a
police radar. I got an old

192
00:23:05,417 --> 00:23:10,875
police radar off eBay for, I
don't remember, 50 bucks or
something like that, not that

193
00:23:10,875 --> 00:23:16,417
much. However, police radars are
typically up above 20 gigahertz,
which in the order of magnitude,

194
00:23:16,417 --> 00:23:22,625
higher frequency than the NSA
seems to be using based on the
ant catalog so maybe that's not

195
00:23:22,625 --> 00:23:25,917
the best approach. One of my
favorite devices is the Hot
Wheels radar gun. You can find

196
00:23:25,917 --> 00:23:27,917
these on eBay for 25 bucks and
they operate at 10 gigahertz,
which is at least closer to the

197
00:23:27,917 --> 00:23:29,917
frequency range that I'm
interested in. And they're just
fun to play with. The device is

198
00:23:29,917 --> 00:23:31,917
made up of kind of three
separate parts. There's some ‑‑
there's a battery compartment,

199
00:23:31,917 --> 00:23:33,917
the wave guide antenna, the big
tube, and on the right hand side
of that the circuit board. And

200
00:23:33,917 --> 00:23:38,667
then a separate circuit board on
the back with the
microcontroller and the LCD. The

201
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:44,292
microcontroller board is the
part that typically fails. So if
you get a broken one, it doesn't

202
00:23:44,292 --> 00:23:51,667
matter because all you really
need is that radio board that
has that little black cable

203
00:23:51,667 --> 00:23:57,667
coming out of the back of it on
the right. And that little black
cable has 3 wires in it and all

204
00:24:00,417 --> 00:24:06,417
you have to do is apply power to
it and you get a base band
signal on the third wire. You

205
00:24:24,083 --> 00:24:30,083
can plug it into an oscilloscope
or you can plug that into a hack
RF or into a sound card even and

206
00:24:33,667 --> 00:24:39,667
measure the return that it's
getting. So it's a pretty cool
device for experimentation. And,

207
00:24:41,875 --> 00:24:45,750
you know, it's really easy to
add that base band output. I
recommend checking out that

208
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:51,292
website if you want to find one
of those and learn how to take
it apart, which is a little

209
00:24:51,292 --> 00:24:57,625
annoying. There's also, I've
noticed, quite a few devices
that you can find that are very

210
00:24:57,625 --> 00:25:01,833
similar to the Hot Wheels radar
gun, but in a smaller package,
they don't have the whole big

211
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:06,375
wave guide antenna, they don't
have the plastic and trigger and
everything. They are designed as

212
00:25:06,375 --> 00:25:12,250
modules for people to use in
their own little electronics
project. If you search eBay for

213
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:17,750
Arduino radar, you will find a
few of these things shipping
from Hong Kong and they are only

214
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:24,042
a few dollars so that is an
interesting option. They are at
the ten and half gigahertz band,

215
00:25:24,042 --> 00:25:30,042
which higher than the devices in
the ant catalog. The coffee can
radar is pretty cool, from Greg

216
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:38,750
Sharvot, and various other
friends that have posted
information about that design,

217
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:45,042
or that family of designs. There
was a talk here at DEF CON a few
years ago on the subject. It's

218
00:25:45,042 --> 00:25:51,417
cool expect it's typically used
with capture ‑‑ base band
capture using sound card, which

219
00:25:51,417 --> 00:25:58,667
is a low bandwidth and isn't
sufficient for some of the
targets, the higher bandwidth

220
00:25:58,667 --> 00:26:05,792
targets that I'm dealing with.
So it has potential. Also it has
some circuitry to do FMCW radar,

221
00:26:05,792 --> 00:26:13,500
which is more complicated than
the simple CW radar that is all
you need for this type of

222
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:20,458
application. So what I'm doing
primarily is using hack RFI One
which is my own design SDR

223
00:26:20,458 --> 00:26:28,000
platform. By the way, if any of
you backed hack RF on quick
starter, I'm happy to announce

224
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:34,000
they have all shipped.  	>>
[Applause].  	>> Yeah, whoa!
Although some of the shipment

225
00:26:39,208 --> 00:26:46,458
notifications have been delayed,
but the units are actually
shipped. So I'm using hacker RF

226
00:26:46,458 --> 00:26:53,208
primarily which is a software
defined radio peripheral that
connects to a host computer.

227
00:26:53,208 --> 00:26:57,750
It's open source hardware so
anyone build this, anyone can
get them and extend the design

228
00:26:57,750 --> 00:27:03,750
and I think that's important
when doing anything sciency. The
official operating frequency

229
00:27:06,583 --> 00:27:11,042
range is from 10 megahertz to 6
gigahertz. If you want to know a
thing about the unofficial

230
00:27:11,042 --> 00:27:16,625
operating frequency range, come
to my talk at the wireless
village tomorrow. The base

231
00:27:16,625 --> 00:27:23,667
bandwidth is 20 megahertz, which
is 3 orders of magnitude higher
speed than a sound card. I was

232
00:27:23,667 --> 00:27:30,292
talking about how the sound card
input really isn't fast enough
for some of the targets that I'm

233
00:27:30,292 --> 00:27:36,208
interested in, but 20 megahertz
is quite a bit of bandwidth. Not
as much as the ant catalog radar

234
00:27:36,208 --> 00:27:42,417
devices, but it's enough to be
able to do some really
interesting experiments and it's

235
00:27:42,417 --> 00:27:49,500
a half duplex transmit receiver
which means I can transmit or
receive but I can't do both at

236
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:57,375
the same time which is why I
have two units up here, one to
transmit and one to receive. So

237
00:27:57,375 --> 00:28:02,500
my super sophisticated cardboard
test apparatus holds two hack
RFs and two directional

238
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:08,958
antennas. These PCB antennas.
I've actually split this up here
so I can have these antennas

239
00:28:08,958 --> 00:28:16,000
pointing different directions
instead of being parallel. I can
make a triangle out of them and

240
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:22,000
we'll see how that goes. And I'm
using a frequency of 2482
megahertz, 2.482 gigahertz. It's

241
00:28:25,583 --> 00:28:31,583
right at the top end of the 2.4
ISM band used by Wi‑Fi and
Bluetooth, however, just above

242
00:28:33,917 --> 00:28:39,083
the frequency used by Wi-Fi and
Bluetooth in the U.S. So there's
a little bit of room at the top

243
00:28:39,083 --> 00:28:45,083
of the band that isn't getting
used by a whole lot. And the
NSA, according to the ant

244
00:28:45,083 --> 00:28:49,750
catalog is using frequencies in
the range of 1 to 4 gigahertz,
so this is kind of right in the

245
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:55,750
middle there. And it just so
happens that range happens to be
in the kind of center area of

246
00:28:58,875 --> 00:29:04,875
the hack RF where I get the best
hack RF performance around 2.5,
2.4 gigahertz, that band is

247
00:29:08,333 --> 00:29:14,750
where I get the best performance
and it's also easy to find off
the shelf filters and amplifiers

248
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:19,958
if you want to experiment with
amplifying these things for
example. Although you have to be

249
00:29:19,958 --> 00:29:25,917
careful about that, I'm using
unamplified hack RF for my demo
here today. This is a pretty

250
00:29:25,917 --> 00:29:32,125
good operating frequency and
tThis is what I've done most of
my testing at for these variety

251
00:29:32,125 --> 00:29:38,125
of reasons. The first
retroreflector that I built is
called conga flock. I don't know

252
00:29:40,458 --> 00:29:45,917
if you guys can see it very
well, but up there across the
top, those numbers are

253
00:29:45,917 --> 00:29:50,833
centimeters. And between those
two orange pieces of wire,
there's a little tiny piece of

254
00:29:50,833 --> 00:29:56,833
circuit board. I know what you
guys are wondering, how int he
world did this thing get to be

255
00:29:59,042 --> 00:30:05,042
so huge? It's giant. It's giant
for a number of reasons. The
first retroreflector I made, I

256
00:30:07,667 --> 00:30:13,417
very first one, was just a bare
transistor that I soldiered some
wires to. And then I decided

257
00:30:13,417 --> 00:30:19,417
well, it's good to have a PCB, a
substrate, that kind of holds
everything together and gives it

258
00:30:21,625 --> 00:30:28,125
mechanical stability. And then I
wanted to have a few extra
components so that I could

259
00:30:28,125 --> 00:30:33,667
experiment with some things,
I'll talk about in just a
second, and then even after

260
00:30:33,667 --> 00:30:39,417
doing that, it turned out that
the circuit board was less than
half the minimum size

261
00:30:39,417 --> 00:30:46,417
requirement from Osh Park, my
favorite PCB maker, so I had to
double the size. But at least

262
00:30:46,417 --> 00:30:51,750
that gave me some room to put
some silk screen text on it and
give it a little bit of a handle

263
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:57,750
so I can put it into my bench
vice and work on it a little
bit. So I'm going to go over the

264
00:31:00,792 --> 00:31:04,583
hardware design here. I usually
go over electronic schematics in
details in a talk like this, but

265
00:31:04,583 --> 00:31:09,375
this one is simple enough that I
think it's worth going through
in detail. The first thing you

266
00:31:09,375 --> 00:31:15,625
need to know, the thing in the
middle, the funny little thing,
Q1 is a mosfet, a type of

267
00:31:15,625 --> 00:31:22,333
transistor. And then all of the
various long rectangles are
resisters or they are places

268
00:31:22,333 --> 00:31:27,375
where you can put a resister or
some other passive component.
However, the one on the upper

269
00:31:27,375 --> 00:31:32,333
right, R1, that's do not
populate component. It's just
something I put there, it's is

270
00:31:32,333 --> 00:31:36,125
footprint I put there just in
case I wanted to experiment with
putting a different impedance in

271
00:31:36,125 --> 00:31:40,750
that spot. So we can ignore
that. It's not populated. And
the two at bottom are not

272
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:46,083
populated, but they have a
little bypass through them where
you have to cut the bypass if

273
00:31:46,083 --> 00:31:50,833
you do want to populate. Those
two at the bottom are there in
case I want to change the

274
00:31:50,833 --> 00:31:56,667
circuit in the future. So we can
ignore those, those don't really
exist in the circuit. And then

275
00:31:56,667 --> 00:32:01,458
the other resister there, the
only purpose of that 10k
resister is just to protect the

276
00:32:01,458 --> 00:32:07,500
gate of the mosfet and it
doesn't really affect the way
the circuit works much, other

277
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:13,125
than providing the protection.
And the mosfet itself, the one
I'm using typically have

278
00:32:13,125 --> 00:32:19,125
built‑in protection, so we can
ignore that, too. And what we're
left with is an incredibly

279
00:32:21,167 --> 00:32:27,000
simple circuit with an antenna
connected at the top, the target
device connected on the left,

280
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:33,625
and the mosfet in the middle. A
mosfet is just a transistor and
you can think of it as a switch,

281
00:32:33,625 --> 00:32:40,625
when the gate, which is the
input signal from the target
device, when the gate is going

282
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:46,625
up and down in voltage, the
mosfet switches on and off the
antenna. That's all this thing

283
00:32:48,792 --> 00:32:53,458
does. It just switches on and
off the antenna according to a
signal that comes from the

284
00:32:53,458 --> 00:33:00,333
target. And that creates a
change in impedance on the
antenna that modulates a

285
00:33:00,333 --> 00:33:07,250
reflective signal from that
antenna. So it's incredibly
simple. It's a one component

286
00:33:07,250 --> 00:33:13,250
circuit. And I can use this as a
general purpose retroreflector
and connect it into whatever

287
00:33:17,042 --> 00:33:23,042
device I want as long as that
input is swinging through a
couple of volts, at least, when

288
00:33:25,083 --> 00:33:32,417
typically target devices will
have 3.3 volts or 5 volts,
that's plenty to drive this

289
00:33:32,417 --> 00:33:38,417
thing. So I made a few and they
are really small. So I made
1,000. And if you want to make

290
00:33:45,583 --> 00:33:50,875
one, I have this whole kit
together here that I'm going to
deliver to the hardware hacking

291
00:33:50,875 --> 00:33:58,875
village that includes the
circuit boards, the mosfets,
some wire you can use for the

292
00:33:58,875 --> 00:34:03,708
antenna and some wire
strippers/cutters. And this is
what you do if you want to build

293
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:08,667
your own. All you have to do is,
the first step is break off a
PCB from the panel. That's a

294
00:34:08,667 --> 00:34:14,542
little more annoying, they are
not scored very well, but find a
nice sharp edge on a table and

295
00:34:14,542 --> 00:34:18,875
you can break these things off.
Then you cut two antenna wires
and you want to make them about

296
00:34:18,875 --> 00:34:22,125
an inch long for operation in
the 2.4 gigahertz band. There's
a nice little guide I have

297
00:34:22,125 --> 00:34:26,167
Sharpied on to the bin here. And
so cut two of those and soldier
the mosfet on to the board and

298
00:34:26,167 --> 00:34:29,792
solder the antenna wires on to
the board. And then you might as
well solder the other two couple

299
00:34:29,792 --> 00:34:33,250
of wires on to the other two
little pin headers because
you're going to need something

300
00:34:33,250 --> 00:34:39,250
in there to connect to a target.
So if you soldier a short little
piece of wire, you can put

301
00:34:53,708 --> 00:34:59,000
alligator clips or whatever to
it or solder your other end to
your target. So it takes a

302
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:04,042
little bit of electronics
know‑how. And I apologize, these
things are a little harder to

303
00:35:04,042 --> 00:35:10,417
solder than they could have been
and harder to break apart than
they could have been, so if you

304
00:35:10,417 --> 00:35:15,917
do try this, you're going to
hate me. But hopefully you'll
have fun or at least take home a

305
00:35:15,917 --> 00:35:21,917
souvenir. And then I will solder
it into something, in this case
I took a PS2 cable from a PS2

306
00:35:24,792 --> 00:35:30,583
keyboard and spliced in the
conga flack to the middle and I
was able to get a return off of

307
00:35:30,583 --> 00:35:37,750
it that way. So flamencoflock
was my next retroreflector. It's
taking this same design

308
00:35:37,750 --> 00:35:44,042
basically and putting it into a
convenient form factor for
experimenting with PS2

309
00:35:44,042 --> 00:35:50,667
keyboards. So all it does it has
two PS2 connecters, you can kind
of see one of them in the photo

310
00:35:50,667 --> 00:35:56,958
there. I have one up here. It
has two PS 2 connecters and a
retroreflector in the middle. So

311
00:35:56,958 --> 00:36:02,125
the actual circuit, if you look
at the two antenna wires,
there's a little black blob

312
00:36:02,125 --> 00:36:08,792
right next to them, that's the
whole circuit, all the rest is
just connecter. So if I'm going

313
00:36:08,792 --> 00:36:16,250
to snip PS2, I'm going to be
tapping either the clock line or
the data line. The clock line we

314
00:36:16,250 --> 00:36:21,750
see in this diagram at the top
and the data line we see on the
bottom. Now ideally we would tap

315
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:26,958
both to recover the data, but
I'm only going to tap one and
I'm going to tap the data line.

316
00:36:26,958 --> 00:36:31,750
And what we have here is a
diagram of what the voltage on
the line should be for the

317
00:36:31,750 --> 00:36:37,750
letter Q, if somebody were
holding down the letter Q on a
keyboard. And so I'm going to

318
00:36:42,625 --> 00:36:48,625
see if I can snip this using
flamingo flock. Let's see what
happens. I'm just turning on my

319
00:37:03,792 --> 00:37:10,750
hack RF to transmit a couple
seconds at a time at 2484
megahertz. And I'm using my

320
00:37:10,750 --> 00:37:16,750
other hack RF with this flow
graph ‑‑ not this one, this flow
graph here. And the long and

321
00:37:21,042 --> 00:37:27,500
short of it is I'm going to be
picking up the signal and doing
an amplitude demodulation. So

322
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:33,500
I'm doing AM. An AM
demodulation. Let me see if this
all works. Now my ‑‑ I think I'm

323
00:37:40,917 --> 00:37:47,667
getting a signal out of it. Now
if I were to adjust my target
here so everything is well lined

324
00:37:47,667 --> 00:37:53,667
up, I'm firing a signal at it
with one of these antennas and I
am detecting a signal from the

325
00:38:02,042 --> 00:38:08,875
other antenna. And I'm running a
little short on time here, but
hopefully this works. I'm going

326
00:38:08,875 --> 00:38:14,875
to look at triggering this. This
is basically an oscilloscope
that I'm looking at, a software

327
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:27,000
oscilloscope. And see what
happens if I hit some keys. Oh,
I'm getting something changing,

328
00:38:29,708 --> 00:38:35,708
but it's not looking very good.
So this is a total demo fail.
Probably because I spent all

329
00:38:40,125 --> 00:38:45,833
last night trying to raise money
for the EFF and I spent all of
this morning trying to help kids

330
00:38:45,833 --> 00:38:52,458
solder the land taps at the
roots asylum. Ah‑ha, I think I
actually got something. I'm

331
00:38:52,458 --> 00:38:58,458
going to can change my accounts
per division here. And oh, there
we go! Let me see what's going

332
00:39:00,625 --> 00:39:04,583
on. If I ‑‑ well, you're not
actually seeing what you should
be.  	>> [Applause].  	>> So

333
00:39:04,583 --> 00:39:11,333
don't clap yet. It's really
close to working. This is a
little finicky because I have

334
00:39:11,333 --> 00:39:17,333
highly directional antennas and
if they are not aimed very well,
then this may not work

335
00:39:20,167 --> 00:39:26,167
particularly well. I'm
definitely getting something,
but I'm not sure that I'm

336
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:37,167
actually getting ‑‑ like I'm
totally not seeing the letter Q
yet. So I'm just going to show

337
00:39:37,167 --> 00:39:43,167
you a screenshot from a previous
run and move along. In a
previous run I did looked like

338
00:39:45,292 --> 00:39:51,708
that. And do you notice the
three downward pulses and then
the one wide pulse? This is what

339
00:39:51,708 --> 00:39:58,375
it was supposed to look like and
it looks like that. It's very
recognizable. So I'm running

340
00:39:58,375 --> 00:40:02,000
short on time so I'm not going
to be able to do a better job at
my demo, unfortunately. I'm

341
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:07,917
going to show you the rest of my
retroflectors. Tangoflock is a
retroreflector for USB. And I

342
00:40:07,917 --> 00:40:14,375
use it to monitor USB keyboards
in particular because they are
low speed USB devices. I've

343
00:40:14,375 --> 00:40:20,042
briefly tested low speed devices
and I figured out, yes, I'm
getting a signal with

344
00:40:20,042 --> 00:40:25,708
characteristics that look like
low speed USB, but I have not
actually decoded bits. Although

345
00:40:25,708 --> 00:40:32,583
I have decoded bits from the PS2
cable. Full speed USB, which is
kind of the next step up in

346
00:40:32,583 --> 00:40:38,250
speed probably works with this
implant. I doubt that high speed
would work and you would need

347
00:40:38,250 --> 00:40:44,500
much high bandwidth collection
platform than hack RF. Super
speed definately doesn't work,

348
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:49,958
you would need some kind of
incredible system for that and I
don't even connect the wires. So

349
00:40:49,958 --> 00:40:55,958
Salsaflock is the next one I
have. The Def Con speakers ops
were totally awesome to get me

350
00:41:00,625 --> 00:41:05,917
an extra VGA projector and I'm
totally not going to use it
because I'm running out of time

351
00:41:05,917 --> 00:41:13,792
and it probably wouldn't have
gone any better than the PS2
demo. But I have this little

352
00:41:13,792 --> 00:41:21,333
device and again, it's a fairly
simple circuit that gives me big
connecters, that makes it

353
00:41:21,333 --> 00:41:25,958
convenient for experimentation.
This circuit is a little bigger,
it has more components in it.

354
00:41:25,958 --> 00:41:33,250
The reason for that is VGA
signalling is for lower voltage.
There isn't enough voltage swing

355
00:41:33,250 --> 00:41:39,792
in the VGA signal. It's too low
voltage to trigger the mosfet's
gate. So I have to do some

356
00:41:39,792 --> 00:41:47,750
biosing of the mosfet to get it
up to voltage. But I have gotten
to the point with this that I

357
00:41:47,750 --> 00:41:52,292
can detect a VGA signal and I'm
in particularly tapping the red
signal and I can very easily

358
00:41:52,292 --> 00:41:56,250
detect the vertical synch
happening every 60 hertz or
something if I refresh and I can

359
00:41:56,250 --> 00:42:02,417
definitely see patterns within
that, so there's some potential
for recovering the image on the

360
00:42:02,417 --> 00:42:08,417
screen. Now how much of an image
I can get with only doing 20
megahertz sampling with the hack

361
00:42:15,917 --> 00:42:21,917
RF, I have not determined yet.
It may only be useful when the
target has a low screen

362
00:42:24,875 --> 00:42:30,750
resolution, which means it has a
slower pixel clock and you would
need a higher speed sampling

363
00:42:30,750 --> 00:42:37,542
rate in order to target higher
screen resolutions. But this is
an image, this is just a plot.

364
00:42:37,542 --> 00:42:44,542
And you see each of those AMD
modulator signal that I got from
Salsaflock, you see those tufts

365
00:42:44,542 --> 00:42:50,417
there, those individual tufts at
the bottom, those happen 60
times per second and this was a

366
00:42:50,417 --> 00:42:55,833
60 hertz screen refresh, so
that's why I was seeing the
vertical sync. I don't have a

367
00:42:55,833 --> 00:43:00,750
whole lot of time to talk about
counter measures which is
probably a good thing, because I

368
00:43:00,750 --> 00:43:06,792
don't have a whole lot to say
about counter measures. I don't
think that we know enough about

369
00:43:06,792 --> 00:43:12,667
these threats yet to develop
good counter measures, but we
think we need to think about how

370
00:43:12,667 --> 00:43:16,750
we validate that our equipment
works, how we evaluate that it
hasn't been modified or had

371
00:43:16,750 --> 00:43:22,750
things implanted in it. We need
to know, are we being
illuminated or radiated by

372
00:43:26,042 --> 00:43:32,042
things? And are our devices
prone to retroreflection without
being implanted? We don't know

373
00:43:34,750 --> 00:43:39,875
any of those things, we have a
lot of research to do to be able
to do that. There is a talk in

374
00:43:39,875 --> 00:43:45,875
the next hour by Leah that looks
interesting. He is kind of
taking a higher level view of

375
00:43:47,958 --> 00:43:54,000
the problem and trying to figure
out how to detect this stuff. I
want to invite everybody to play

376
00:43:54,000 --> 00:44:00,500
along. An invitation to hack. I
would love if people built some
of these here and started

377
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:06,500
experimenting with them. I would
love if people took my designs
from gift hub and started to

378
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:16,750
build some of their own. If I
solder some up this afternoon,
we'll have some over the at hack

379
00:44:16,750 --> 00:44:21,792
five table in the vendor area.
Darrin was kind enough to give
the NSA play set crew an area

380
00:44:21,792 --> 00:44:27,417
there and other folks who are
doing NSA play set talks are
also going to have some things

381
00:44:27,417 --> 00:44:34,667
there. We are trying to get
tools out to people, if we can.
And of course we have the EFF

382
00:44:34,667 --> 00:44:40,083
summit last night. I want to
remind people, there's a big
open field of research. Do be a

383
00:44:40,083 --> 00:44:47,792
good neighbor if you experiment
with this stuff, know the laws,
try to not interfere with

384
00:44:47,792 --> 00:44:54,458
people. Doing low power
experiments is really easy to
do. I have done PS2 sniffing

385
00:44:54,458 --> 00:45:01,917
from one meter with unmodified
hack RFs that transmit a much
lower power than your Wi‑Fi card

386
00:45:01,917 --> 00:45:08,875
in your laptop. So coming soon,
later this weekend, Mike Ryan is
giving a talk in the wireless

387
00:45:08,875 --> 00:45:14,458
village tomorrow on some really
cool Bluetooth smart stuff,
these are all NSA play set

388
00:45:14,458 --> 00:45:20,542
talks, Josh and Teddy are doing
a talk on I squared C implant,
which is very interesting how

389
00:45:20,542 --> 00:45:27,542
you can expose and get to your I
squared C without opening up
your computer. NSA play set GSM

390
00:45:27,542 --> 00:45:33,542
from Dean and Lochi on Sunday
and PCI express from Joe & Miles
on Sunday. All of these I'm

391
00:45:35,708 --> 00:45:41,042
really excited about. I hope you
check them out. Thank you to
Dean for coming up with the

392
00:45:41,042 --> 00:45:47,250
name, the NSA play set and for
the whole NSA playset crew.
Everyone has been great and

393
00:45:47,250 --> 00:45:53,417
We're a loosely knit group, we
take anybody who comes along and
has a ridiculous name for a fun

394
00:45:53,417 --> 00:46:00,625
project. Please join us, if you
think you have something that
fits in the NSA playset we'd

395
00:46:00,625 --> 00:46:05,625
love to hear from you. Thanks
Jared Boone for helping me
troubleshoot some of my

396
00:46:05,625 --> 00:46:12,000
retroreflectors not too long
ago. NSAplayset.org is where you
can find all information on NSA

397
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:18,000
playset. My retroreflectors are
on gethub and that URL. I
recommend waiting a few days

398
00:46:20,417 --> 00:46:25,833
before you download and have
PCPs made because I do have a
couple of minor corrections I

399
00:46:25,833 --> 00:46:31,500
need to make. They are pretty
minor. They are things you can
fix easily with a soldering

400
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:37,500
iron. And my url for
greatscottgadgets.com is
greatscottgadgets.com. So I'm

401
00:46:40,042 --> 00:46:46,042
going to have a little Q&A
session out by the pool in 15
minutes, so, you know, after I

402
00:46:50,667 --> 00:46:56,417
leave here, go look for me at
the pool. I'll be wearing this
awesome NSA play set T‑shirt

403
00:46:56,417 --> 00:47:03,792
that says my ex key score goes
up to 11. If you see anybody
wearing these shirts, they are

404
00:47:03,792 --> 00:47:09,250
probably people doing awesome
NSA play set or they are people
who supported the EFF last

405
00:47:09,250 --> 00:47:14,250
night. Either way, they are cool
people to talk to. Thank you all
for coming. "This text is being
