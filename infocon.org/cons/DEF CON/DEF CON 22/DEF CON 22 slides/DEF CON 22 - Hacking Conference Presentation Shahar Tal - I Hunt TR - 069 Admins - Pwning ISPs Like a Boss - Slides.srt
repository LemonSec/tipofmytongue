1
00:00:00,167 --> 00:00:07,125
>> Here's Mr. Tal. I'll let him
talk to ya and start the talk.
So, enjoy. [Applause] >> This is

2
00:00:07,125 --> 00:00:13,125
working, great. All right, good
morning. Good morning everyone.
Good. I'm getting an interactive

3
00:00:18,792 --> 00:00:24,792
audience, good. Um, so this talk
is titled "I Hunt TR-069
Admins." Let's get it started

4
00:00:28,125 --> 00:00:35,333
off. So just a quick disclaimer
here. Corporate legal wouldn't
let us you know, actually do

5
00:00:35,333 --> 00:00:41,333
most of this stuff but you'll
see. So first of all I would
like to credit my personal role

6
00:00:43,417 --> 00:00:50,792
model which, and first thank
Taylor Swift for providing
inspiration you know, and words

7
00:00:50,792 --> 00:00:57,958
of wisdom which I've tried to
incorporate into some of the
slides. [Applause]. So yeah. But

8
00:00:57,958 --> 00:01:03,792
seriously if you're not
following this account, you
should because it's hilarious.

9
00:01:03,792 --> 00:01:09,792
Okay. So and obligatory who am
I? My name is Shahar Tal. Yeah,
such profile pic, much coolness,

10
00:01:11,917 --> 00:01:18,667
very professional. I have an
amazing wife and daughter
waiting for me back home. I've

11
00:01:18,667 --> 00:01:24,667
just spent almost 10 years as an
officer in the Israeli defense
forces. Last year I joined check

12
00:01:27,833 --> 00:01:32,833
point where I lead a team in the
malware vulnerability research
group. We occasionally do some

13
00:01:32,833 --> 00:01:39,750
interesting things and hopefully
you will get to see us more this
year. So this is my right leg.

14
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:45,458
Is that, can you see that? I
mean, ok. This is my right leg.
My left one has a hexadecimal

15
00:01:45,458 --> 00:01:52,250
dump. And if you want to see it
just come after the talk. So
starting off with an agenda, I'm

16
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:59,792
gonna give you an introduction
to what TR-069 is. Okay.
[Laughter] And I'm going to tell

17
00:01:59,792 --> 00:02:05,792
you why you should care and I'm
gonna try to give you a sense of
what the landscape feels like.

18
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:14,250
We'll move on to show a few
examples of footage and conclude
with a short summary. So just

19
00:02:17,542 --> 00:02:22,542
beginning with you know,
residential gateways. Sometimes
referred to as home routers or

20
00:02:22,542 --> 00:02:28,667
Soho routers. And we all know
that this is an incredibly
unprotected domain. In recent

21
00:02:28,667 --> 00:02:33,333
years it just gave us more and
more good examples of that. So
we have the Internet census

22
00:02:33,333 --> 00:02:38,667
which showed us that there are
literally millions of devices
out there waiting to be

23
00:02:38,667 --> 00:02:44,833
controlled with default
passwords. We've seen rapid
severance, great coverage, VPN

24
00:02:44,833 --> 00:02:51,125
exploitation, and last year
showing us it's also quite easy
to run code on so many devices.

25
00:02:51,125 --> 00:02:58,583
We've also seen campaigns
targeting devices for criminal
activity and you know, there are

26
00:02:58,583 --> 00:03:05,042
really too many to mention but
some of these guys, maybe some
of them are actually here, have

27
00:03:05,042 --> 00:03:10,792
been doing great work
demonstrating really, what, that
the state of affairs of this

28
00:03:10,792 --> 00:03:16,792
domain. And I'm here to kind of
extend this notion. So what is
TR-069? TR stands for Technical

29
00:03:20,667 --> 00:03:26,708
Report, just kind of like a,
kind of a RFC and you know,
contrary to what you'd expect,

30
00:03:26,708 --> 00:03:31,917
the title and numbering were not
given by a giggling teenager but
a more or less respectable body

31
00:03:31,917 --> 00:03:38,250
called The Broadband Forum,
which is previously known as The
DSL Forum and The Frame Relay

32
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:45,625
Forum. And they're basically
known as-- they are a consortium
of many players in the broadband

33
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:51,625
market and they're attempting to
find standards and common goals.
So in 2004 they released this

34
00:03:55,375 --> 00:04:01,375
CPE WAN management protocol and
which is CWMP or more commonly
referred to as simply TR-069.

35
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:09,458
And the specification went
through five amendments actually
which were released late last

36
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:15,458
year, and to tell you the truth
it's a pretty boring 228 page
document filled with, one sec,

37
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:24,792
filled with fancy words like
mechanism specifications or
schema definitions and you know,

38
00:04:24,792 --> 00:04:30,792
they actually describe pretty
simple things. So let me try and
summarize 200 pages for you.

39
00:04:33,792 --> 00:04:40,583
This is how TR-069 sessions or
provisioning sessions work.
Okay, on the right side we have

40
00:04:40,583 --> 00:04:46,500
the CPE. Which is the TR-069
client. That's your home router.
On the left side you have the

41
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:52,500
TR-069 server which is called an
ACS or an auto configuration
server. And they talk in basic

42
00:04:54,875 --> 00:05:02,625
SOAP RPC and XML or HTTP and
it's that simple. It's important
to mention that the client

43
00:05:02,625 --> 00:05:08,625
always initiates the session
which is a single TCP connection
over which RPC's are made back

44
00:05:17,833 --> 00:05:20,292
and forth. The client begins
with an inform which is studying
the reason or why is the session

45
00:05:20,292 --> 00:05:24,875
is initiated and the ACS follows
with provisioning functions such
as get parameter values, or set

46
00:05:24,875 --> 00:05:31,583
parameters values. It really is
that simple. And there is a dual
authentication mechanism. The

47
00:05:31,583 --> 00:05:37,083
CPE should make sure it has a
verified ACS and the verified
ACS should only accept sessions

48
00:05:37,083 --> 00:05:43,083
from authenticated CPE's. And
here's a quick example just to
get, just to be-. This is an ACS

49
00:05:45,625 --> 00:05:51,625
set parameter value call for a
certain CPE. And this is in fact
-- let me see if I can -- yeah.

50
00:05:54,042 --> 00:06:01,458
Okay. So this is set parameters
value call and this is assigning
a new value for the management

51
00:06:01,458 --> 00:06:07,750
server URL key which basically
means this is updating the
configuration ACS URL for this

52
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:13,750
device for ACS
super-securized.com, whatever.
So these are only some of the

53
00:06:18,583 --> 00:06:24,583
names -- oh, sorry. You see some
really big names up there have
active TR-069 deployments. And

54
00:06:26,875 --> 00:06:33,125
as you can understand this is
not some obscure protocol. This
is a growing trend to adopt it

55
00:06:33,125 --> 00:06:39,125
everywhere. And this is a widely
used defacto device management
standard. Yeah so research in

56
00:06:43,875 --> 00:06:51,625
2010 estimated 115 million
TR-069 devices online, 70
percent of which are Gateways

57
00:06:51,625 --> 00:06:57,208
and you know, today it's
probably more. How about this?
Some very interesting results

58
00:06:57,208 --> 00:07:02,542
from the ZMap guys, Zachary and
his friends at University of
Michigan. And they show that

59
00:07:02,542 --> 00:07:08,542
7547 which is a default WMP port
is actually the second most
popular open port in the world.

60
00:07:10,625 --> 00:07:16,625
This, I mean, this is no joke.
This is a serious, serious
protocol. So let's talk about

61
00:07:19,958 --> 00:07:27,083
some of the functional use cases
for TR-069. So what can you do
with ACS's? You can provision

62
00:07:27,083 --> 00:07:32,333
devices which is what you call
zero configuration. Just remote
management by the tech report

63
00:07:32,333 --> 00:07:37,750
guys, you know, when you call
the call center and they fix
your router, whatever they do

64
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:44,500
there, can monitor for faults,
for malicious activity even,
diagnostics, performance

65
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:52,167
measurements, you can replace,
fix faulty configurations. And
also deploy upgraded firmware.

66
00:07:52,167 --> 00:07:59,292
So I'm betting at least some of
you are surprised with that last
bullet you know, and this is so

67
00:07:59,292 --> 00:08:06,250
you can understanding the power
that's entrusted in these
sessions. Right? So this, and

68
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:13,917
this is a power that service
providers don't necessarily want
you to know about. I mean, think

69
00:08:13,917 --> 00:08:18,000
about this for a second. You
know, without getting too deep
into the trusting your compiler

70
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:24,000
issues you know, who do you
really trust to run code on your
devices on demand? You know? How

71
00:08:26,625 --> 00:08:32,625
about when it's done silently?
Remotely? With elevated
permissions? You know I might

72
00:08:35,875 --> 00:08:42,042
trust some of these you know,
very big vendors like Microsoft,
they have heavily protected

73
00:08:42,042 --> 00:08:48,042
update servers, whatever, I
might trust them, but my ISP,
I'm not sure. So yeah. ACS's

74
00:08:50,292 --> 00:08:56,042
have that trust and they can
remotely manage all their
things. So here's a short story.

75
00:08:56,042 --> 00:09:01,917
This is my home router or at
least it used to be. You know
I'm starting to learn about

76
00:09:01,917 --> 00:09:07,875
TR-069 and I'm poking around
looking for the TR-069
configuration and there's no

77
00:09:07,875 --> 00:09:12,750
evident pages with these
settings. I know you can't
really read it from there but

78
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:18,750
nothing says TR-069. And you
know oh, well I should go into
expert mode. Right? Oh why not?

79
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:25,250
I'm an expert right? So I go
into expert mode but still
nothing saying TR-069. So maybe

80
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:31,333
it's under remote management. I
clicked it and then no, that's
only for web management, which

81
00:09:31,333 --> 00:09:37,000
is, you know, properly turned
off by the way. And this doesn't
makes sense to me because I

82
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:43,667
know, I know these devices have
TR-069 enabled and on the specs
I've heard that my provider uses

83
00:09:43,667 --> 00:09:50,208
this. So as it turns out my
provider customized the firmware
to hide the fact that they were

84
00:09:50,208 --> 00:09:57,792
in control this was done using
the highly sophisticated HTML
commenting technique.

85
00:09:57,792 --> 00:10:03,792
[Applause]. So you know, I
entered the URL, and then there
I get the details and I have the

86
00:10:09,125 --> 00:10:16,875
set up screen and you know
suddenly I see that there is no
legitimate way to turn this off.

87
00:10:16,875 --> 00:10:22,833
So the disabling, the informs is
just like the periodic hello
messages, it just, I mean, it

88
00:10:22,833 --> 00:10:28,833
still has no real effect. What
you actually could do is change
the ACS URL but never mind about

89
00:10:30,833 --> 00:10:36,833
that. So you know in the later
firmware version they actually
changed this page to be you

90
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:44,542
know, just a status page, now
there really is no legitimate
way without you know, getting a

91
00:10:44,542 --> 00:10:50,542
root on your device, to turn off
TR-069. And so the point is
someone out there knows that

92
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:59,000
they have a lot of power in
their hands and they clearly
don't want me to know about it.

93
00:11:01,125 --> 00:11:07,125
So with that context in mind
let's take a broader look on
TR-069 architecture. And, sorry.

94
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:17,667
Again on the right side we have
a CPE, the client which can also
act as a proxy from any other

95
00:11:17,667 --> 00:11:22,958
home devices, such as VOIP
phones, Nest devices, set up
boxes, whatever wants to be

96
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:30,583
controlled. And on the other
side we have the ACS. That's
the, you know, the one server

97
00:11:30,583 --> 00:11:36,583
that's in control. On its north
bound side it is attached to ISP
internal assets like the OSS,

98
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:45,500
BSS, Billing, Policy, the call
center of course, and this south
bound interface is where the

99
00:11:48,417 --> 00:11:54,417
CPE's go. So, wait. What?
There's a single machine in this
design you know, that's in

100
00:11:59,083 --> 00:12:05,083
control of an entire fleet of
devices for that ISP which would
make it in fact the single point

101
00:12:09,375 --> 00:12:15,375
of ponage. So if ever there was
a high value target in an ISP
that would be it. Well luckily

102
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:27,042
this south bound interface is
using the most trusted and
secure line that you can think

103
00:12:27,042 --> 00:12:33,042
of which is the public Internet.
[Laughing]. So you know, looking
at this from the APT or you

104
00:12:40,417 --> 00:12:46,833
know, nation state attacker's
perspective, so you can take
control of this one target, one

105
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:54,750
accessible target and you're in
complete control by design over
millions of devices. This is

106
00:12:54,750 --> 00:13:00,750
like, that's the NSA's dream
right there. So now that we all
understand that TR-069 is very

107
00:13:05,458 --> 00:13:10,833
powerful what could you actually
do if you had control of an ACS?
I see my shot coming up. So I'm

108
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:16,833
just gonna pause for that one
sec. It's very, very dramatic,
very dramatic. [Applause]. >>

109
00:13:20,125 --> 00:13:26,125
Keep talking. >> I'm gonna keep
talking. All right. So what
could you actually do? >> I see

110
00:13:31,375 --> 00:13:37,375
you've already taken your shot.
>> I apologize for that.
[Laughing]. It was a long night.

111
00:13:40,042 --> 00:13:46,042
You know, I copied all those
Swift On security quotes like
late last night. So what could

112
00:13:49,958 --> 00:13:55,250
you actually do if you had
control of an ACS? You know, and
that's a big if right now

113
00:13:55,250 --> 00:14:02,625
because we don't know how
protected this is. But you can
actually get private data, you

114
00:14:02,625 --> 00:14:07,750
can get the SSIDs, you can get
the host names, Mac addresses,
usernames, you can get phone

115
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:13,750
numbers. With some vendors you
can even get complete
configurations including

116
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:18,750
passwords. You can set every
parameter you know, starting
with the classic DNS change.

117
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:25,917
Right? We all know that one. You
know, but you can go for more
sophisticated stuff like adding

118
00:14:25,917 --> 00:14:31,917
your hidden WiFi. >> Shut up! >>
I'm shutting up. [Laughter] >>
Come on you guys know the drill.

119
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,667
How about a little love for the
brand new speaker? [Applause].
Scumbag ACS? >>Yes sir. >> What

120
00:14:40,667 --> 00:14:46,667
would an attacker do if...
[Laughing]. Maybe I should
attend this talk. >> That's

121
00:15:06,292 --> 00:15:12,292
right. Okay so you can add the
new hidden SSID, you can add
like a new hidden WiFi to that

122
00:15:14,917 --> 00:15:21,000
router and just connect to it
whenever you're around or you
can even you know, replace the

123
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:27,042
WAN service with a tightly
controlled tunnel. You can
download logs, configurations,

124
00:15:27,042 --> 00:15:34,000
firmware from the device, and
you can actually you know, go
all the way and custom make your

125
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,958
own firmware for all the clients
of that. You can do this
selectively, you can do this for

126
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:44,958
everyone. This has crazy
abilities. So now, you know, we
understand this is a critical

127
00:15:47,042 --> 00:15:52,708
component in modern Internet
infrastructure and with this
understanding let's go out and

128
00:15:52,708 --> 00:15:58,708
research TR-069. So a couple
things just with cropping up
Google when you look it up. And

129
00:16:01,458 --> 00:16:07,792
you know, there's Luka, which is
the main developer for CWMP,
that's an open source TR-069

130
00:16:07,792 --> 00:16:14,083
implementation. But his talk is
mostly about interoperability
issues, and much less about

131
00:16:14,083 --> 00:16:20,042
security. And just a nice blog
post by these guys, 3S Labs and
they actually make some few good

132
00:16:20,042 --> 00:16:26,042
points but they never follow it
up with anything afterwards. And
that's about it. And I mean when

133
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,333
we were seeing this, we were
really surprised. Because you
know, this is why we think that

134
00:16:34,333 --> 00:16:40,250
this talk is so important
because no one is talking about
this yet and this is important.

135
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:46,250
We think more people should and
hopefully you guys will. And so
why is that? And the problem is

136
00:16:50,833 --> 00:16:56,958
this is software in a niche
market. So this is service
provider world. This is out of

137
00:16:56,958 --> 00:17:04,500
most consumer's and researcher's
reach. You know, where is the
TR-069 community? Right, I mean,

138
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:10,250
are there like TR-069 parties
out there? I don't know if I'm
not invited. Maybe I should. I

139
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:16,000
don't know. I mean you know how
there's a subreddit for
everything, I mean, nothing for

140
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:23,292
TR-069, this is-. You know, we
were looking for this, you know,
a TR-069 media outlet, something

141
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:30,667
that covers you know, TR-069
happenings. And you know what?
Apparently there is one. So this

142
00:17:30,667 --> 00:17:37,333
actually is a website called
TR-069 Central. It's a WordPress
blog. And you know, don't laugh

143
00:17:37,333 --> 00:17:44,667
about it because you know, they
have 16 followers on Twitter.
[Laughter] Yeah, let's see if I

144
00:17:44,667 --> 00:17:50,667
can -- yeah they're following 23
people including me. [Laughter]
And, you know, of course I'm

145
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:59,875
kidding because they actually do
a decent job of covering TR-069
happenings and they have

146
00:17:59,875 --> 00:18:05,875
independent reviews and such.
But, and when I say they I mean
a pretty nice guy called Max and

147
00:18:14,583 --> 00:18:20,583
they compiled a list of ACS
vendors, some smaller names,
some bigger players and, you

148
00:18:23,667 --> 00:18:29,667
know, we started browsing the
vendor sites. As you go along
you get this certain feeling.

149
00:18:33,375 --> 00:18:39,375
Let me try to show you what I
mean. Let's hope this works. >>
This is a presentation on SS/SI

150
00:18:45,542 --> 00:18:51,542
for TR-069 auto-configuration
service. >> This is great music,
by the way. >> Let's begin by

151
00:18:55,250 --> 00:19:01,250
logging into ACSI and enter your
username and password. >> Okay
so maybe that's enough... So you

152
00:19:05,542 --> 00:19:11,542
know the feeling is much ACS
vendors, much TR-069, many
features have such a 1999 look

153
00:19:13,792 --> 00:19:19,792
and feel. Right? So you know,
the more we read, the more we
understand that ACS software,

154
00:19:21,917 --> 00:19:29,583
are basically web applications
that are filled with CPE
controlled values that go

155
00:19:29,583 --> 00:19:37,458
through lots of processing, and
you know, and we all know that
clients can be like totally

156
00:19:37,458 --> 00:19:43,458
trusted. Right? So we can look
at TR-069 problems in two
planes. So we have insecure

157
00:19:47,333 --> 00:19:53,333
configuration and we have
insecure implementation. Of
course we have the combination

158
00:19:55,917 --> 00:20:01,917
of both. More words of wisdom
there. [Laughing]. So how do you
find ACS's in the wild? So first

159
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:14,917
off you can hack a single
router. Right? We all know
that's kind of easy. And then

160
00:20:14,917 --> 00:20:22,542
you just get the ACS URL, that
one. But you can do more
interesting stuff like you know,

161
00:20:22,542 --> 00:20:28,708
scanning, you know, ZMap,
Masscan, for the win, you know.
Scanning 7547 and friends.

162
00:20:28,708 --> 00:20:34,708
There's also UPnP which are a
lot of fun actually. And there's
public data that you can search

163
00:20:39,708 --> 00:20:46,042
like the Internet census and the
DNS census. Of course there's
some fun Google dorks if you're

164
00:20:46,042 --> 00:20:53,333
looking for a specific product
and of course you can also go
for, let me show that for you,

165
00:20:53,333 --> 00:21:01,208
and look for interesting stuff
there. But anyway there are
vulnerable ACS's online. I

166
00:21:01,208 --> 00:21:07,208
guarantee it. So how is ACS
authentication performed? So SSL
is recommended. [Laughter] Which

167
00:21:14,375 --> 00:21:20,375
means that a whole bunch of lazy
ISPs avoid the trouble and just
go with the shared secret which

168
00:21:24,417 --> 00:21:30,417
is HTTP authentication. Right,
so either basic whatever. And
we've actually done a little

169
00:21:33,167 --> 00:21:40,500
survey, we've collected a few
hundred ACS URLS belonging to a
few hundred ISPs and would you

170
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:46,500
like to guess how many of those
were using HTTPS or SSL? So yeah
so here we go so, 81 percent

171
00:21:51,333 --> 00:21:57,333
were actually not encrypting any
of this, you know, super
critical provisioning sessions.

172
00:22:00,917 --> 00:22:06,917
And this is like -- I mean, what
-- [Laughing]. You know that
means, that all it takes is one

173
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:17,250
freaking you know, NSA quantum
packet, you know, single quantum
TCP packet to take control of a

174
00:22:21,333 --> 00:22:26,292
provisioning session and give
you a new firmware or change any
of the other parameters I've

175
00:22:26,292 --> 00:22:32,292
just described. Here's a nice
trick. So our interfaces, right,
we take the ACS passwords, which

176
00:22:35,458 --> 00:22:41,458
is, you how the ACS is supposed
to know your, the real CPE and,
but as I mentioned before they

177
00:22:44,417 --> 00:22:50,417
allow you to change the ACS URL,
which basically means you can
change it to a web server that

178
00:22:52,458 --> 00:22:57,833
you control and you know, even
downgrade to basic
authentication and just make it

179
00:22:57,833 --> 00:23:03,833
even easier to parse. So yeah,
nice Jerry. So let's talk about
certificate validation. And the

180
00:23:07,792 --> 00:23:15,750
technical report states that if
TLS1.2 is used then the CPE must
authenticate the ACS using the

181
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:21,625
ACS provider certificate. You
know, that sounds reasonable.
That actually sounds right. But

182
00:23:21,625 --> 00:23:27,625
this is how I imagine this is
perceived in most ISP management
forums, and I did a little field

183
00:23:35,083 --> 00:23:41,125
test. This is obviously a fake
certificate right, it's a
self-signed certificate that we

184
00:23:41,125 --> 00:23:47,125
just created for this, for
testing purposes. And so you
claim to validate SSL

185
00:23:51,333 --> 00:23:58,000
certificates but the fact you
accepted my self-signed one
determined that that was a lie.

186
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Yeah, so first big hard face
palm for the day. [Laughing]. So
let's run through a short recap

187
00:24:06,042 --> 00:24:13,125
until this point. So I hope
you're convinced that TR-069 is
you know, dangerously powerful

188
00:24:13,125 --> 00:24:19,125
and TR-069 servers are high
value targets and, you know,
we've also seen actual proof

189
00:24:21,792 --> 00:24:29,417
that a lot of implementations
just aren't serious enough. And
now we're gonna take it to the

190
00:24:29,417 --> 00:24:36,083
next level. So at this point I
have to apologize in advance. I
wish I could give some more

191
00:24:36,083 --> 00:24:41,000
details on some of the following
slides but however we do realize
that there are many unpatched

192
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:47,000
instances out there and we don't
want to make it too easy for the
bad guys. So our first target

193
00:24:50,958 --> 00:24:56,875
was a Java based open source
project, it's called OpenACS,
you know, and we started

194
00:24:56,875 --> 00:25:03,292
auditing the code and three days
later we get remote code
execution. So we have reflection

195
00:25:03,292 --> 00:25:09,500
and file upload and this is like
you know, at this point we're
like -- and this is exactly what

196
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:15,250
we expected to find. Right? We
expect to find poor code, this
is awesome. I mean, let's keep

197
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:20,917
it up. So we move forward. We
pick Genius.acs, which is you
know, another open source

198
00:25:20,917 --> 00:25:27,792
project. This one, this is
fairly modern. It's under active
development. No JS, MongoDB, all

199
00:25:27,792 --> 00:25:33,792
the new hip stuff. And we
started editing, auditing and
two days later we got a

200
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:41,583
functional remote code execution
exploit. So this one actually is
kind of nice. Let me try to show

201
00:25:41,583 --> 00:25:47,583
you that. So this is a regular
expression that's filtering out
bad characters. And an input

202
00:25:52,375 --> 00:25:58,375
that follows to JavaScript eval
but they forgot the G at the end
of the regular expression

203
00:26:01,208 --> 00:26:07,208
meaning that you put in one bad
character and it just removes
that and lets you do whatever.

204
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:19,125
And the real bad thing is this
is running as root. No JS
servers, yeah. This is bad. Lets

205
00:26:19,125 --> 00:26:22,500
you dump like AC shadow and
stuff. [Laughing]. Yeah, that
would be our faces when we saw

206
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:28,500
it. Moving on, some more ponage.
Here's some green text for you.
Scanning for IvP4 ACGS and we

207
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:47,208
detect an instance, a vulnerable
instance in Middle Eastern ISP,
and when I say Middle Eastern

208
00:26:47,208 --> 00:26:53,208
I'm talking about a major, a
very Muslim state and you know,
the northbound interface is

209
00:26:55,458 --> 00:26:59,750
exposed which means the internal
API, I mean you can actually
make calls to internal API,

210
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:05,750
which means that we own that.
And then we are like, you know,
face palm. But OP actually

211
00:27:07,792 --> 00:27:14,750
delivers the vulnerability
report. The ISP support center
was not thrilled with an Israeli

212
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:20,750
calling about the vulnerable
infrastructure. [Laughing].
[Applause]. But we showed them

213
00:27:24,417 --> 00:27:30,417
this, and you know, practically
all blanked out. It's a few
thousands devices. Eight out of

214
00:27:37,125 --> 00:27:44,792
10 would report again. So yeah,
I mean what if you're leaving a
critical Internet internal asset

215
00:27:44,792 --> 00:27:51,625
listening to the entire world
with no protection whatsoever?
The next case is kind of a big

216
00:27:51,625 --> 00:27:57,417
one. We can't disclose the
vendor at this point in time but
he has a massive install base,

217
00:27:57,417 --> 00:28:03,417
locally, globally, and our
findings include the internal
API authentication bypass code

218
00:28:06,125 --> 00:28:12,125
injections there. And denial
service attack. The combination
of which allows writing

219
00:28:15,208 --> 00:28:21,208
arbitrary files to any location
including C slash I net to ASB
enabled Internet server. So you

220
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:32,500
know, remote execution, right?
And we went ahead and contacted
one large provider to test this

221
00:28:37,792 --> 00:28:43,792
with permission. And eventually
we ended up owning just over
half a million devices and this

222
00:28:46,625 --> 00:28:52,625
is a major ISP. And this is just
an example provider. We just
picked one. And you know this

223
00:28:56,417 --> 00:29:02,917
has been unpatched for at least
two years now so it is very
possible that we're not the

224
00:29:02,917 --> 00:29:08,917
first to discover that flaw but
we don't really care. Appreciate
it. Appreciate it. [Applause].

225
00:29:16,625 --> 00:29:22,625
So you must be asking yourselves
what can I do? What can I
actually do? If you don't trust

226
00:29:26,625 --> 00:29:31,958
your gateway there really aren't
many things that you can do.
But, you know, adding another

227
00:29:31,958 --> 00:29:37,875
security -- well first of all
you can hide under the couch and
never connect to the Internet,

228
00:29:37,875 --> 00:29:43,167
but that's obviously not a good
solution. So the first thing you
can do is you know, audit your

229
00:29:43,167 --> 00:29:49,167
own TR-069 settings. You know,
actually ensure that you know,
SSL is turned on, that there is

230
00:29:51,958 --> 00:29:58,000
proper certificate validation.
You know, if you're unsatisfied
you can disable it, if you can

231
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:03,958
disable it. And, you know,
adding another network security
layer is not bad. You know you

232
00:30:03,958 --> 00:30:09,250
can add another router with NAT
or firewall capabilities. I mean
we sell these devices but

233
00:30:09,250 --> 00:30:15,083
actually, quite frankly you can
use open source firmware
alternatives and they'll do just

234
00:30:15,083 --> 00:30:22,458
great work. And you know, ask
your provider about the TR-069
configuration. That's, I mean,

235
00:30:22,458 --> 00:30:28,458
it's their responsibility. So
you can't fix the problem, so
there is no easy fix because the

236
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:38,750
bad implementations are out
there. So TR-069 has to mature
more. Awareness is key. You

237
00:30:41,542 --> 00:30:47,667
know, this is what we're here to
do. TR-069 can be secure and
this is up to the security

238
00:30:47,667 --> 00:30:53,667
community which is you guys.
We're hoping to get as many you
know, new research blogs out

239
00:30:56,167 --> 00:31:03,708
there as we can find. And ACS
vendors they have to start you
know, writing better software.

240
00:31:03,708 --> 00:31:08,000
Put your money in secure coding.
I mean, show your security
stance. I've never seen a bug

241
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:15,333
bounty for TR-069 software and I
think we should. Service
providers, I mean you're the

242
00:31:15,333 --> 00:31:23,042
owners of the traffic and you
have to protect your customers.
That's your responsibility. So

243
00:31:23,042 --> 00:31:28,375
for some future directions.
We're actually currently looking
to extend this research. So you

244
00:31:28,375 --> 00:31:36,000
remember how 7547 was the second
most popular port in the world?
And his is by design. So we're

245
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:43,250
looking into some client ponage,
stay tuned for CCC so this opens
up an interesting exploitation

246
00:31:43,250 --> 00:31:49,250
vector. Right. Thank you very
much. [Applause].
