1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,667
Announcer: And so, right now
we're going to open up track
two, our 11:00 o'clock slot with

2
00:00:05,667 --> 00:00:13,417
Maggie speaking about GFCI's and
girl fault interrupted.
[Applause] Maggie: I'm glad I

3
00:00:13,417 --> 00:00:19,417
don't have to stand behind that.
So, hello DEF CON. If you are
here to see sparks and smoke,

4
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:33,625
you've came to the right talk.
I'm super excited to be here to
talk to you guys about something

5
00:00:33,625 --> 00:00:40,583
that I tripped over, pun
intended. [Inaudible.] But
first, let me tell you a little

6
00:00:40,583 --> 00:00:46,625
bit about myself. My name is
Maggie Jauregui and I have about
three years of security

7
00:00:46,625 --> 00:00:53,417
experience. The first two at
Intel in Mexico doing security
validation for the graphics

8
00:00:53,417 --> 00:01:00,458
driver on the software side,
specifically for DirectX 8, 10
and 11. For the past year, I've

9
00:01:00,458 --> 00:01:07,625
been working in the U.S. doing
software security validation for
wireless innovation

10
00:01:07,625 --> 00:01:14,542
applications. This is my fourth
DEF CON, first time speaking,
super excited. I come from the

11
00:01:14,542 --> 00:01:21,167
most incredible country in the
world and if you haven't been
there, you really should. Bucket

12
00:01:21,167 --> 00:01:27,750
list it at some point. The most
amazing people, food, everything
and I'm having a hard time

13
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:33,750
figuring out why I ever left. I
got an incredible education as
well. I got to participate in

14
00:01:36,583 --> 00:01:40,792
math tournaments where I was
named fourth best in the country
two years in a row and first and

15
00:01:40,792 --> 00:01:48,292
second best in highly script
date a couple times. When I'm
not doing techy stuff, I do more

16
00:01:48,292 --> 00:01:54,292
artsy stuff. A couple of
disclaimers: Everything I do,
research, images, here is my own

17
00:01:59,167 --> 00:02:06,292
and in no way, shape or form
does it represent anything on
the side of my employer's past,

18
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:13,583
present, or future. Like I said,
my experience was mostly
software so this business is

19
00:02:13,583 --> 00:02:20,417
something I've been looking at
for a few months. I don't claim
myself the GFCI queen of the

20
00:02:20,417 --> 00:02:25,042
world so if you have
corrections, or suggestions or
ideas, I'd be super happy to

21
00:02:25,042 --> 00:02:31,042
talk to you guys about them.
There's a small part of me, or
maybe not that small part of me,

22
00:02:33,333 --> 00:02:39,250
that loves that I can start my
first DEF CON talk ever with: So
I was doing my hair the other

23
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:45,250
day . . . [Audience laughing]
'cause I was going to go out on
a date and this guy thought we

24
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:51,458
would save millions
communicating through RF. So we
bought a couple walkie-talkies

25
00:02:51,458 --> 00:02:56,917
and enough batteries until
kingdom come and we hadn't
really synced as to when to use

26
00:02:56,917 --> 00:03:03,542
them. So I was doing my hair to
go out and I thought I heard
something in the other room,

27
00:03:03,542 --> 00:03:07,667
someone speaking through the
radio. So I ran over there and I
talked through it. "Hello,

28
00:03:07,667 --> 00:03:13,792
hello, is anyone there?"
Nothing. So I come back to the
bathroom and I click the call

29
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:19,167
button to make it buzz on the
other side [makes buzz noise]
and when I do that, the GFCI of

30
00:03:19,167 --> 00:03:24,000
my hair dryer on the wall
vibrates viciously out of
control -- horrible sound, then

31
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:31,250
a spark and smoke. So, my jaw
dropped. I was like, "Oh my god,
you've got to see this." And,

32
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:35,583
yeah, for some reason I thought
my hair dryer was dead so I went
and got another one and tried

33
00:03:35,583 --> 00:03:42,458
the same thing. And it worked as
well. But devices keep working
after you disable the GFCI. It's

34
00:03:42,458 --> 00:03:48,458
only the GFCI that I get to
effect. So then we needed
supplies. Where can we get a

35
00:03:52,583 --> 00:03:59,167
whole bunch of hair dryers and
stuff? So thank Goodwill for all
the materials for the

36
00:03:59,167 --> 00:04:06,417
presentation. We got a couple of
GFCI sockets, an antenna, and
more decent radios. I studied

37
00:04:06,417 --> 00:04:12,417
for my radio license. I got my
call name and all. [Applause]
And then I started thinking, why

38
00:04:18,917 --> 00:04:25,208
would this matter or how do
these devices interact with us
on a day-to-day basis? Because

39
00:04:25,208 --> 00:04:31,958
don't get me wrong, if someone
can DOS even temporarily my hair
blow drying ability in the

40
00:04:31,958 --> 00:04:37,375
morning, to me that is an
extremely high severity
vulnerability but I wasn't sure

41
00:04:37,375 --> 00:04:44,292
that the rest of the world would
see it that way. So where are
these things? One of the people

42
00:04:44,292 --> 00:04:48,458
that we worked with suggested I
look into AFCI's as well. That
kind of put the picture

43
00:04:48,458 --> 00:04:54,292
together. Because in your house,
your outlets, your electricity
is basically either protected by

44
00:04:54,292 --> 00:05:01,375
GFCIs, AFCIs, sometimes both.
So, I really focused more on
GFCIs and I'll tell you guys why

45
00:05:01,375 --> 00:05:07,375
in a second, but we do go over a
little bit of AFCI vulnerability
towards RF as well. Why are

46
00:05:11,292 --> 00:05:16,500
these things there? They serve
two different purposes. GFCIs
intend to protect you from

47
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:24,042
electric shock. They have to do
so in a really quick manner. I
think they have between 25 and

48
00:05:24,042 --> 00:05:31,500
40 milliseconds to stop because
when the body comes in contact
with from five to 30 million

49
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:37,500
amps, then that's when your
heart goes into metrical shock
and that's when ventricles

50
00:05:39,792 --> 00:05:45,792
instead of contracting the way
they normally do, they just
spazz out. Whenever it senses

51
00:05:48,792 --> 00:05:54,833
that the electricity -- if you
think of the circuit as water
and what comes in has to go

52
00:05:54,833 --> 00:05:59,208
somewhere, so it has to return.
If not the same amount of
current that's coming in is

53
00:05:59,208 --> 00:06:03,500
coming out, it detects there's a
problem. It has to be really
specific and really quick.

54
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:08,250
That's what GFCI's do. AFCI's on
the other hand are trying to
keep your house from catching

55
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:15,083
fire. It's basically like worn
out old cables, if there's a
spark anywhere, AFCI's are the

56
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:20,958
ones that are supposed to find
it. They do so by analyzing the
wave form of the alternating

57
00:06:20,958 --> 00:06:27,458
current. So it has to be smooth
and it's a much more complex
little piece of equipment than a

58
00:06:27,458 --> 00:06:35,125
GFCI. So, code requirement.
Every year the National
Electrical Code deliberates

59
00:06:35,125 --> 00:06:42,833
where we need what. GFCI's are
needed anywhere where people can
come into contact with both

60
00:06:42,833 --> 00:06:48,833
electric equipment and water.
So, your bathroom, pools, hot
tubs, kitchens, laundry areas,

61
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:58,750
anything above grade level,
unfinished basements or garages.
Whole bunch of stuff. And AFCI's

62
00:07:01,875 --> 00:07:07,125
pretty much protect everything
else. They do overlap in a
couple things, I think the

63
00:07:07,125 --> 00:07:13,875
kitchen and laundry area. Other
than that, the general living
areas, the family rooms, dining

64
00:07:13,875 --> 00:07:19,875
rooms, living rooms, bedrooms,
sunrooms, any other room. I live
in Oregon. I need some. Okay.

65
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:30,250
This is how GFCI's work. Their
little diagram. And it's really
quite simple. It's a little

66
00:07:33,083 --> 00:07:37,792
transformer and there's a
magnetic core, the toroid, and
so you -- and there's an

67
00:07:37,792 --> 00:07:43,792
insulated copper wire that goes
around them and that's just a
general normal transformer.

68
00:07:49,708 --> 00:07:57,083
Through it go the wires, the hot
wire on the way out and the
neutral or the hot wire on the

69
00:07:57,083 --> 00:08:03,083
way in and the neutral on the
way out. According to the right
hand rule, if the currents are

70
00:08:05,917 --> 00:08:09,125
going opposite directions and
they are the same magnitude,
then they should cancel each

71
00:08:09,125 --> 00:08:14,000
other out. There should be no
current in that wire. If it
detects a small current in that

72
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:20,375
wire, then it's calibrated
specifically to 3 or 5
milliamps, then the solid state

73
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:26,542
circuitry will inform the shunt
trip to open the circuit and it
will save you from

74
00:08:26,542 --> 00:08:32,542
electrocution. Pretty simple
electro-mechanical. So, here it
is. Right hand rule, going one

75
00:08:35,875 --> 00:08:42,500
way, going the other way, they
should cancel each other out but
there's also -- if you notice in

76
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:48,000
the little toroid there's two,
the hot and the neutral, and
there's an extra one with a test

77
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:54,667
button. So if you push the test
button, it will enable that
third line, which will imbalance

78
00:08:54,667 --> 00:09:00,458
it and trip it. It will cause a
trip. That's what you're
supposed to do to test if the

79
00:09:00,458 --> 00:09:05,833
GFCI mechanism is actually
working. I recommend for people
to test it often. How many of

80
00:09:05,833 --> 00:09:11,833
you test your GFCI's often? Very
good. I'm super impressed. Cool.
Okay. Inside there is something

81
00:09:15,667 --> 00:09:23,083
called a solenoid. Oops. This
thing that says "shunt trip used
to open circuit," that's what

82
00:09:23,083 --> 00:09:29,083
this solenoid is. And there's
the coil that goes around the
transformer then coils around

83
00:09:29,083 --> 00:09:35,083
this little thing and inside it
is like a Silverbullet that
moves in and out and there's a

84
00:09:38,417 --> 00:09:44,625
spring. So as long as the
power's connected, the spring
keeps the bullet inside. If it

85
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:50,625
notices -- if it gets the signal
that there's a little current
there that shouldn't be, then

86
00:09:52,875 --> 00:10:00,708
the bullet comes out and pops
the reset button, opening the
circuit. This is the thing that

87
00:10:00,708 --> 00:10:07,417
we cause trouble with with RF,
so that's why I'm going into it.
[Inaudible] Like I said, we're

88
00:10:07,417 --> 00:10:11,750
analyzing wave forms and making
sure that they are smooth. It's
a lot more complicated as it

89
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:17,750
does thermal checking and it
does, I think, also some of them
do ground fault and the wave

90
00:10:20,708 --> 00:10:26,708
form analyzing and something
else -- power surge. You're
dealing with much higher

91
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:34,750
voltages and it's a little more
scary. So now, some demos. I
start with the less impressive

92
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:43,500
one. Just so you know. This is
just a regular GFCI plugged into
a wall where this is close

93
00:10:45,667 --> 00:10:53,417
range. So we're pointing at it,
putting it nearby with either a
radio or the antenna and this is

94
00:10:53,417 --> 00:10:59,417
what happens. [Loud Buzz.] You
should be able to see some
smoke. But it might not be too

95
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:09,500
noticeable. You see some?
[Chiming sound] There you go, a
little bit of smoke. This is the

96
00:11:20,792 --> 00:11:26,292
first one. This one we get a
spark. These are both closed.
The little box is closed. Then I

97
00:11:26,292 --> 00:11:32,292
open it up so we can see what's
actually going on inside. This
one we can start to look

98
00:11:35,792 --> 00:11:41,792
through. [Buzzing] You saw? That
blows it up. That's pretty much
it. This is the socket, also

99
00:11:49,917 --> 00:11:55,917
close range. You should look at
the lead in the corner. There
you go. That's all. Do it from

100
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:08,750
the side. Do it from the back.
Now across the wall. Okay,
confession time. We were testing

101
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:30,417
these things. First thing I did
after testing the 90-degree
built into the plug GFCI was try

102
00:12:30,417 --> 00:12:35,375
to find them around the house.
So I tested the bathroom ones,
the kitchen ones and then other

103
00:12:35,375 --> 00:12:41,167
people's houses, friends of
course, with their consent.
[Audience laughing] Because I

104
00:12:41,167 --> 00:12:45,042
consider it like lock picking.
It must be the same. You know,
If you do your own, if you buy

105
00:12:45,042 --> 00:12:49,708
things to break them apart, then
it's okay but you're not
supposed to go messing around

106
00:12:49,708 --> 00:12:55,708
with people. That's not why you
get a radio license, no. So, but
yes, at some point testing one

107
00:12:58,375 --> 00:13:03,292
of the sockets on the wall, we
heard a distant vibration
somewhere else and we were like,

108
00:13:03,292 --> 00:13:09,208
"what's that?" It was something
in the neighbor's house. So we
stopped immediately but we

109
00:13:09,208 --> 00:13:15,208
realized we could do it across
the walls, too. Radio on one
side, GFCI on the other. Bad

110
00:13:21,667 --> 00:13:27,667
filming. Little delay. [Buzzing]
Basically the same. Now remote.
We got it up to about three or

111
00:13:37,542 --> 00:13:44,917
four yards depending on the
device. Yeah, it really depended
on the device. Some of them

112
00:13:44,917 --> 00:13:49,542
needed to be really close, some
could be a little further. I did
get recommendations from people

113
00:13:49,542 --> 00:13:56,708
to use a bilateral amplifier or
you can use a huger, bigger
antenna with a tripod, but you

114
00:13:56,708 --> 00:14:01,833
know you got a lot of wattage
and it becomes scary and a
little more terroristy. With

115
00:14:01,833 --> 00:14:09,792
this little thing, I was
affecting my neighbors. You
know, I didn't want to figure

116
00:14:09,792 --> 00:14:15,792
out, I don't know, that I could
fry a chicken with it. It wasn't
really the point. There. So

117
00:14:19,917 --> 00:14:25,917
doing different pulses. And
actually it would burn up. You
can kind of see the button move

118
00:14:39,917 --> 00:14:45,917
there. So this is the cool one.
Try to see if you can notice the
button flying out. [buzzing]

119
00:15:13,208 --> 00:15:19,542
[Laughter] [Applause] This is
when you open the GFCI. When I
got here for real, so yeah,

120
00:15:19,542 --> 00:15:26,375
first thing -- [Laughter] -- I
swear everything works if you go
check, everything works. I just

121
00:15:26,375 --> 00:15:29,708
had to check to see if they were
vulnerable, everything is
vulnerable here. The sockets,

122
00:15:29,708 --> 00:15:35,292
the hair dryer, everything. I
just tested them. Then I wanted
to show my dad, "Look, here's

123
00:15:35,292 --> 00:15:39,625
what I do." I said, "I'll film
it, what the hell." With this
one, you get the flying piece of

124
00:15:39,625 --> 00:15:47,083
component like flaming out of
it, it almost caught my dad's
shirt on fire. So, for the demos

125
00:15:47,083 --> 00:15:53,083
later, we have a prepared goon.
[Buzzing] Male Voice: It's
smoking. Wow. You're lucky it

126
00:16:10,917 --> 00:16:16,917
didn't get me. [Laughter]
[Inaudible] [Applause] Maggie:
So, this is what a fried GFCI

127
00:16:29,708 --> 00:16:35,708
looks like. The solenoid. The
encapsulation of the wire on the
solenoid melts out making it not

128
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:49,833
a solenoid anymore, so it's not
a GFCI anymore. That's why it
stops working. The device keeps

129
00:16:49,833 --> 00:16:55,833
working because what we do is
that -- let me go back to the
diagram of the solenoid. Here.

130
00:16:59,542 --> 00:17:06,958
We get the bullet to move,
because it's expecting -- okay.
Maybe I should go back to where

131
00:17:06,958 --> 00:17:12,958
we were. Sorry about that. The
reason why I didn't try with
bigger things is because of the

132
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:20,542
wattage and because it was
scary. But we did notice people
who have done this before. There

133
00:17:20,542 --> 00:17:25,500
was a Youtube video. I thought
that would be good enough
instead of me trying to jump

134
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:31,500
onto my house and install this
huge thing. [Applause] Okay,
cool. So, I didn't make this

135
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:50,500
myself so I can't vouch for its
validity but it's pretty cool.
They have an antenna on the top

136
00:17:55,417 --> 00:18:01,417
of another house. They are
pointing it at the circuit
breaker, the AFCIs. Male Voice:

137
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:09,583
[Inaudible] There's an antenna
right there above the tree I
think. Black pole, radio

138
00:18:15,667 --> 00:18:21,667
antenna. Maggie: It's this
antenna on the top of a house
and it's pointing to the circuit

139
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:38,250
breaker of a different house.
[Inaudible] Cool, that's good
enough. So they pointed it at

140
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:50,500
the circuit breaker of a
different house. This is what
happens. [Video -- Audio

141
00:18:54,792 --> 00:19:00,792
inaudible] Really slow video.
Male Voice: You can stop packing
the wireless for just 2 minutes

142
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:17,750
please. [Laughter] Maggie: Okay,
so you see, you see? So it
bounced a whole bunch. AFCI's

143
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:33,750
are also vulnerable to RF, you
just need much lower frequencies
and bigger antennas that are

144
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:39,000
much more expensive and scarier
so I didn't do that. Male Voice:
Seems like a logical breaking

145
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:45,000
point. You guys know the drill.
A round of applause for our
first time speaker. [Applause]

146
00:19:49,083 --> 00:19:55,083
Cheers. Maggie: Cheers.
[Applause] Male Voice: To DEF
CON. Maggie: To DEF CON. So I

147
00:19:58,542 --> 00:20:06,042
can't guarantee there wasn't
someone back there sparking the
wires making these things

148
00:20:06,042 --> 00:20:12,708
trippy. We're kind of trusting
these Youtube people but there's
also, you know, the national

149
00:20:12,708 --> 00:20:18,708
association -- Male Voice: This
is really cool. Maggie: Thank
you.[Laughter] So, I did find a

150
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:30,500
letter from the National
Association of Amateur Radio,
kind of apologizing, because the

151
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,667
amateur radio enthusiast's
neighbors were complaining that
their AFCI circuit breakers were

152
00:20:32,667 --> 00:20:35,083
being tripped. And they did work
with Levatron to make a better
breaker that would withstand

153
00:20:35,083 --> 00:20:37,458
that kind of frequency. So
what's going on? Like I said, I
only did the directional

154
00:20:37,458 --> 00:20:43,458
antenna, that's kind of where I
stopped. The fundamental thing
that I'm doing is extending the

155
00:21:01,208 --> 00:21:08,167
electromagnetic field that comes
from the radio directionally and
that is captured by the

156
00:21:08,167 --> 00:21:14,500
transformer which creates a
current that flows through that
wire. And then it makes it

157
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:20,500
believe that there's a ground
fault but it doesn't -- it
thinks -- what? Yeah. Oh yeah,

158
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:31,750
we weaponized it. Pepper laser.
When I did this my antenna
wouldn't work because there was

159
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:40,000
so much metal in the hair dryer
that it messed up my
electromagnetic field.

160
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:48,500
[Laughter] I can't say much
about my antenna.[Applause] This
is about as much as I can say

161
00:21:52,375 --> 00:21:58,375
about my antenna. [Inaudible
voice in audience] But look at
it now. Okay. So now, resonance.

162
00:22:02,708 --> 00:22:08,708
Wires or antennas. We are
antennas and things resonate to
a certain frequency. Like if you

163
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:17,292
grab a tuning fork and you hit
it against your leg and then put
it up against a guitar, the

164
00:22:17,292 --> 00:22:23,750
string of the note that is tuned
to the same note as the fork
will vibrate. Only that one.

165
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:29,750
Things are tuned to resonate to
a certain frequency, that's how
radios work too. You modify the

166
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:38,250
metal inside, the amount of
twists and the width of it
determine what frequency it

167
00:22:42,375 --> 00:22:50,333
vibrates to. Things are made to
work at a certain frequency. I
think for 120 volts it's like 60

168
00:22:50,333 --> 00:22:58,250
hertz all around. So we're
talking about possibly a distant
cousin harmonic that the devices

169
00:22:58,250 --> 00:23:05,333
are capturing. And I can do two
things. I can either do what I
showed you guys where, I should

170
00:23:05,333 --> 00:23:12,542
do both -- I can either trip it,
meaning it was on and now it's
off, but I can click the reset

171
00:23:12,542 --> 00:23:19,750
button and it will work again. I
don't ruin the GFCI mechanism.
Or, I can melt it and it will

172
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:27,583
never work again. It's just hard
wired. So, that leads me to
believe that the different

173
00:23:27,583 --> 00:23:34,542
materials and the different
designs are either capturing,
like resonating exactly to a

174
00:23:34,542 --> 00:23:40,542
harmonic that it is expecting or
just something annoying and not
quite enough to move the bullet

175
00:23:44,458 --> 00:23:49,917
all the way through. So, yeah,
this is what it looks like on
the inside. These are the

176
00:23:49,917 --> 00:23:57,125
components that this one, the
FCR, we'll talk about it a
little bit more. That's the one,

177
00:23:57,125 --> 00:24:03,125
this one and probably the C4 are
the ones that shoot out. This
will be the transformer that's

178
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:12,458
capturing and this is the
solenoid that melts. I have to
go back to the other picture to

179
00:24:12,458 --> 00:24:18,458
show you from before. This. So,
the bullet usually gets the
signal it's supposed to and goes

180
00:24:23,167 --> 00:24:28,417
all the way through. When I'm
giving it kind of a weird
frequency that it's not used to

181
00:24:28,417 --> 00:24:36,000
and it's way smaller than what
it expects, instead of 60 hertz,
it's a lot more, so it moves.

182
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,667
Like a little bit forward then
back, a little bit forward and
back. It's alternating. So it

183
00:24:40,667 --> 00:24:45,708
does this and that's what causes
the vibrating sound [buzzing
sound] and things like this are

184
00:24:45,708 --> 00:24:53,250
only supposed to work for so
long. Like when you buzz someone
into a building, the thing is

185
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:58,042
meant to just be a shunt trip,
right, you click it and then
it's opened and the person walks

186
00:24:58,042 --> 00:25:04,458
in. If you stand there and you
push it, it will melt. It's not
meant to withstand long periods

187
00:25:04,458 --> 00:25:10,708
of time. So, when we keep
annoying it for long enough, it
overheats and melts and it stops

188
00:25:10,708 --> 00:25:16,708
working. Okay. I was just
admiring my GFCIs. The ones that
are vulnerable and the ones that

189
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:36,958
are not. The top ones are
susceptible to my attack, the
bottom ones aren't. Can anyone

190
00:25:36,958 --> 00:25:42,958
guess or see anything that is
different between these two
things? [Inaudible voice in

191
00:25:46,292 --> 00:25:51,208
audience.] 	Yes. The transformer
on the bottom ones is definitely
larger and has more turns.

192
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:04,500
There's also a little chip in
there, in the top ones. This is
that chip. I couldn't find

193
00:26:11,292 --> 00:26:16,583
these, the actual ones that I
had physically. I found a data
sheet for one of the patents and

194
00:26:16,583 --> 00:26:21,792
I'll show the patents that I
found that are vulnerable and
ones that are not. That patent

195
00:26:21,792 --> 00:26:26,750
led me to a number piece and I
went to go see that but the ones
that I had in my hand were not

196
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:34,542
that number. The data sheet that
I found supposedly does protect
against... The reason why I

197
00:26:34,542 --> 00:26:41,708
think its vulnerable is because
sometimes cheap Chinese
electronics will count both

198
00:26:41,708 --> 00:26:47,708
positive and negative current,
so it's adding up slowly but it
measures that there's more and

199
00:26:51,083 --> 00:26:56,500
more current coming through
there. If it's only measuring
the positives, like it should,

200
00:26:56,500 --> 00:27:02,500
then it will never get to the
threshold that it needs. Right?
So, what I think is that this

201
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:11,208
little chip is -- we couldn't
find the data sheet for it
anywhere -- is counting both the

202
00:27:11,208 --> 00:27:17,708
positive and the negative
impulses of the frequency that
I'm sending and therefore

203
00:27:17,708 --> 00:27:24,708
conducting the current. If it
just looked at the positive,
then it wouldn't happen. In the

204
00:27:24,708 --> 00:27:30,708
case of the FDR's, one of the
ones that jumped up in flames,
and it was very, very simple and

205
00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:38,792
I've calculated when the gate
gets a little signal. It's
really low. I forget what it

206
00:27:38,792 --> 00:27:44,792
was, but a tiny amount of amps,
then it will connect them. So,
if it notices a little current

207
00:27:47,042 --> 00:27:53,042
there, it will activate the
shunt trip. So, it connects to
the solenoid and the little

208
00:27:55,833 --> 00:28:01,833
ceramic capacitor also had a
chunk of it jumped out. And
these explode from overheating,

209
00:28:05,042 --> 00:28:10,625
overcurrent or short circuit, in
this case, I'm thinking
overheating as we saw. It melts.

210
00:28:10,625 --> 00:28:17,625
The GFCI power outlets -- really
the most I could get out of
them, the ones built in the

211
00:28:17,625 --> 00:28:24,625
wall. The house where I live is
17 years old and the bad patents
that I found are about 15 years

212
00:28:24,625 --> 00:28:29,750
old, so it makes sense. But the
newer ones that I got at the
store, I could trip them but I

213
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:35,750
couldn't melt them. And these
have a centric transformer coil
which was a different thing that

214
00:28:38,583 --> 00:28:44,583
I didn't see anywhere else. The
patents, the bad and the good,
it seems like there's kind of an

215
00:28:48,292 --> 00:28:55,000
equal amount of yes' and no's
but if you look at the count
that I found, there is a really

216
00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:02,500
popular bad GFCI out there. 1999
patent, so it's fifteen years
old and I found in it a whole

217
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:05,458
bunch of things and
across-the-board in a lot of
different brands. I'm not naming

218
00:29:05,458 --> 00:29:11,458
brands but pretty much all of
them. They are all Chinese,
pretty much. Yeah, this was my

219
00:29:14,833 --> 00:29:22,083
bag coming in. I was worried
that TSA would - [Laughter]--
ruin my presentation but they

220
00:29:22,083 --> 00:29:28,083
didn't. Other cases in which it
might be a bad idea, some people
don't even know that their stuff

221
00:29:31,542 --> 00:29:36,000
is connected to a GFCI. I saw
people online saying, "For some
reason if I trip this button the

222
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:43,750
lamp outside will shut off."
It's like, what? So, if you get
a GFCI outlet, the top two

223
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:49,833
screws are to plug into the
wall, the hot and neutral and
the bottom two you can connect

224
00:29:49,833 --> 00:29:55,750
to other plugs or appliances and
it will make them part of the
circuit so they're also GFCI

225
00:29:55,750 --> 00:30:01,750
protected or vulnerable.
Relevance, why could this
matter? Well RFI could be just

226
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:11,750
accidental, that you live near a
radio station or an amateur
radio enthusiast or it could be

227
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:17,917
intentional. It's wireless and
fingerprint free. Although I did
read that devices have very

228
00:30:17,917 --> 00:30:24,000
specific frequency so they could
do forensics and match the
signal, the bad signal to the

229
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:29,375
device but I didn't get into
that. And that was one of the
things that kind of annoyed me

230
00:30:29,375 --> 00:30:34,667
from my talk. I found it was
either just annoying, trolling,
where someone is making their

231
00:30:34,667 --> 00:30:40,667
guacamole and I'm like, "ha, now
you can't," or potentially super
serious things where it would

232
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:51,000
matter, like someone who lives
alone and is elderly and depends
on a breathing machine or

233
00:30:53,083 --> 00:30:59,958
overnight hemo-dialysis or
depends on a machine somehow.
That would be bad if they could

234
00:30:59,958 --> 00:31:06,125
trip the switches somehow. Male
Voice: Hospitals. Maggie: Yeah,
hospitals. I tried not to get

235
00:31:06,125 --> 00:31:10,083
into that because this is my
first talk and I don't want to
anger the wrong people. There

236
00:31:10,083 --> 00:31:16,042
are medical grade GFCI's but I
didn't look into them. Also
hospitals should have a whole

237
00:31:16,042 --> 00:31:23,333
bunch of other things to protect
them, right? So, if someone
attacked their AFCIs for

238
00:31:23,333 --> 00:31:29,792
blackouts, they're prepared for
that, they're staffed and
there's manual overrides. So

239
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:35,792
they should be good but, yes, in
public places, it could matter.
Just recently there was a GFI

240
00:31:38,167 --> 00:31:44,167
news article about an eight year
old boy in Lake Carrow in Texas
who died, electrocuted, because

241
00:31:46,333 --> 00:31:53,333
of a GFI malfunction and it was
hard wired. I mean, it was
burnt, it didn't work but it was

242
00:31:53,333 --> 00:31:59,458
on. It burnt on. And he was in
the water for a total of 15
seconds I think before he was

243
00:31:59,458 --> 00:32:06,375
pulled out. And the city said
that the city limits changed and
that's why they hadn't

244
00:32:06,375 --> 00:32:13,667
originally checked for
everything to be up to code
standards. So, that's an example

245
00:32:13,667 --> 00:32:21,667
of when it could matter and for
the most part, it won't matter.
It's kind of like a life

246
00:32:21,667 --> 00:32:27,958
insurance. I mean -- well I
guess we're all gonna die
someday -- but you might never

247
00:32:27,958 --> 00:32:33,292
need it. I don't know that my
life has been saved by my hair
dryer countless times but it's

248
00:32:33,292 --> 00:32:41,125
nice to know maybe I did need it
and then it was there for me.
You know? It's one of those

249
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:48,333
things that when you need it,
you really need it. So, yes, our
solutions are testing often.

250
00:32:48,333 --> 00:32:55,375
Make sure that button pops up
the reset and just reset it
again. Updating to newer

251
00:32:55,375 --> 00:33:00,375
patents, the newer devices
should be better. They would all
kind of be vulnerable but to

252
00:33:00,375 --> 00:33:08,000
different frequencies. The newer
ones are vulnerable to lower
frequencies like they are

253
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:14,000
supposed to, the 60 hertz. The
thing that kind of shocks me is
that we've known about this for

254
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:20,417
a long time. And it's been fixed
for a long time. So why is it
that everything I buy and

255
00:33:20,417 --> 00:33:28,167
everywhere I go I can do this?
We should know better, right?
Male Voice: Could we get a

256
00:33:28,167 --> 00:33:33,167
recall for some of these
products? Maggie: Yeah and I
will talking to some of these

257
00:33:33,167 --> 00:33:39,667
and saying, "Hey." I'm guessing
older patents mean cheaper in
mass production. Maybe in a hair

258
00:33:39,667 --> 00:33:45,667
dryers, maybe it doesn't matter
but what if, you know? Also if
you have a loved one who's home

259
00:33:50,625 --> 00:33:56,750
alone or yourself who depends on
an electrical appliance being
on, just make sure you have

260
00:33:56,750 --> 00:34:02,625
other options like a power
generator, batteries, or a
manual override so you have

261
00:34:02,625 --> 00:34:09,000
wiggle time to react. And
another thing that we thought
was to do a little fair day cage

262
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:16,417
grounded encasing covering the
thing that should also be a
solution. Now I need my lovely

263
00:34:16,417 --> 00:34:22,417
assistant so we can do some of
these things. Okay. For my first
trick --[Laughter] [Inaudible

264
00:34:37,875 --> 00:34:43,875
voice in the audience.] What?
Computer Voice: Frequency
Closed. Maggie: So, the power

265
00:34:53,625 --> 00:34:59,625
outlets we only found that we
could do from really close by
but then we thought wires are

266
00:35:04,375 --> 00:35:10,083
antennas too and they will
conduct an electro-magnetic
field. If you do it through the

267
00:35:10,083 --> 00:35:16,083
wire, like maybe thinking across
the wall, you could potentially
get to it. There we go. That's

268
00:35:21,167 --> 00:35:27,167
one. [Applause] And now. These
two. Now hair dryer, live from
track 2. Alright. I opened these

269
00:35:37,458 --> 00:35:43,458
up so we could see something
interesting. Male Voice: Why are
you standing back there? Buzzz.

270
00:35:52,792 --> 00:35:58,792
Maggie: Get a camera. Male
Voice: Are those electronics
I've got on me? [Laughter.]

271
00:36:06,167 --> 00:36:12,167
Maggie: Should we... [Inaudible
voice in audience.] If the
device is on while you're

272
00:36:15,958 --> 00:36:19,625
interfering with it, it will
turn off but then you just
unplug it, re-plug it and the

273
00:36:19,625 --> 00:36:25,625
device works. Should I plug this
in? Male Voice: Yeah, hold on.
[Random Noise][Inaudible]

274
00:36:34,875 --> 00:36:40,875
Maggie: I have to reset it.
These have not been tampered
with, I just opened them up. I'm

275
00:36:57,375 --> 00:37:02,875
trying to get a camera so you
can see it. I don't know if it
will be big enough. We have

276
00:37:02,875 --> 00:37:09,333
someone ready with a cup of
water just in case. Nothing has
ever happened, although it was a

277
00:37:09,333 --> 00:37:15,333
close call. Male Voice:
Something has to break. Maggie:
We sacrificed the PCB and

278
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:23,500
countless hair dryers for the
demo gods. You know how it is.
Male Voice: Plugging in the

279
00:37:27,458 --> 00:37:33,458
camera does help. Male Voice: It
is plugged in. I swear. Maggie:
Nope. We can just do it here.

280
00:37:38,583 --> 00:37:44,583
Male Voice: Here you go. Maggie:
Oh cool. No. Okay. Male Voice: I
think we're doing it live.

281
00:37:49,083 --> 00:37:55,083
Maggie: Doing it live. Male
Voice: Hold it up to the mic,
then they can hear it. Male

282
00:37:59,625 --> 00:38:05,625
Voice: Don't point it at me.
Maggie: I need another mic
that's not on my face.

283
00:38:12,375 --> 00:38:16,292
[Laughter[LW1]] And you can --
this is one of the more sensible
ones. You could probably do it

284
00:38:16,292 --> 00:38:22,333
from a bit. Do the laser,
there's a purple laser. Male
Voice: How many hands do you

285
00:38:22,333 --> 00:38:28,333
think he has? Maggie: Sorry.
[Clicking Noise.] If we do it
from closer, maybe we'll get it

286
00:38:45,417 --> 00:38:51,417
faster. Male Voice: I swear to
god this is not a hold my gear
moment.[Laughter] Male Voice:

287
00:39:18,667 --> 00:39:24,667
There you go, it's smoking! Male
Voice: We have magic
smoke.[Applause] Male Voice:

288
00:39:34,250 --> 00:39:40,250
Wanna do the other one?
[Inaudible] Maggie: And yeah, I
could show, maybe... [Hair dryer

289
00:39:43,708 --> 00:39:49,708
noise] Still works. We could do
another one. You guys want to do
another one? [Applause] Last

290
00:39:53,125 --> 00:39:59,125
one. I swear. We have like 6
more. By the way, I thought to
make it interesting whoever

291
00:40:01,208 --> 00:40:07,208
tweets me the coolest or most
bizarre thing that you could
think of that would be bad that

292
00:40:07,208 --> 00:40:15,042
could be done with this by like
4:00 p.m., I'll get you just off
the plane from Mexico Also Anjo

293
00:40:15,042 --> 00:40:21,125
tequila and I'll give it to you
later at the Rio somewhere for
your Saturday night partying

294
00:40:21,125 --> 00:40:27,125
needs. [Applause] So tweet me
maybe.[Laughter] Male Voice:
There you go. You all ready?

295
00:40:54,792 --> 00:41:00,792
[Buzzing] Maggie: Better.
[Applause] Thanks to awesome
co-workers and friends who've

296
00:41:05,042 --> 00:41:11,042
helped me, given me ideas. We've
got a cute little blooper.
Where'd the antenna go? Oh no!

297
00:41:14,875 --> 00:41:22,750
[Laughter] Yeah. Proxy is famous
now. That's about it. If you
guys have questions or

298
00:41:22,750 --> 00:41:29,250
something, I think I have a
couple seconds. Male Voice: If
you have any questions, there is

299
00:41:29,250 --> 00:41:32,792
a Q & A mic right here. Come to
the mic. Male Voice: KD5QLN.
Have you tried other frequencies

300
00:41:32,792 --> 00:41:37,833
besides UHF like 2 meters?
Maggie: Oops, I didn't hear
that. Male Voice: Have you tried

301
00:41:37,833 --> 00:41:43,083
other frequencies besides UHF
like 2 meters? Maggie: 2 meters?
Male Voice: Like 120 megahertz?

302
00:41:43,083 --> 00:41:46,750
Male Voice: Anything besides 2
meters? Male Voice: She's doing
UHF. That's 420. Maggie: No.

303
00:41:46,750 --> 00:41:53,292
Male Voice: 120 megahertz I
could probably do it. Maggie: We
tried the range of the radio.

304
00:41:53,292 --> 00:41:59,292
Not much more. Male Voice: Okay.
Male Voice: More questions, come
up to the mic. Male Voice: This

305
00:42:03,667 --> 00:42:07,333
is sort of a shameless plug. You
have your technician's license?
Maggie: Yes. Male Voice: You

306
00:42:07,333 --> 00:42:11,958
should show up tomorrow at noon
and get your general or your
extra. We're doing amateur radio

307
00:42:11,958 --> 00:42:19,500
exams across the hall at the
Krypto Privacy Village. Maggie:
Awesome. Male Voice: Yeah, if

308
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:25,500
you guys want to do
this.[Applause] Male Voice: Any
more questions? Maggie: If not,

309
00:42:29,167 --> 00:42:35,167
you can catch me later. I hope
to meet you guys at a party or
hallway near you. Thank you.

310
00:42:39,208 --> 00:42:42,542
[Applause]
