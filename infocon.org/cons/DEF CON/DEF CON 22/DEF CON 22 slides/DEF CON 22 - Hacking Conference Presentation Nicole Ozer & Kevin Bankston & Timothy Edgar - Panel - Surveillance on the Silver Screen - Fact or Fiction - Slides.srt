1
00:00:00,292 --> 00:00:04,125
>> All right. Anyways, this is
going to be Nicole, Kevin and
Tim and they're goign to be

2
00:00:04,125 --> 00:00:11,375
speaking about serveillance on
the silver screen. I know the
hour's kind of like - let's give

3
00:00:11,375 --> 00:00:17,375
them a big hand. ?	>>
[Applause]. ?	>> Come on.
Louder! Awesome. Thank you! ?	>>

4
00:00:19,875 --> 00:00:26,875
Fabulous introduction. Thank
you. Sorry about that. So thank
you all for coming, particularly

5
00:00:26,875 --> 00:00:33,958
Saturday night at 6:00 PM. This
is going to be a super fun
panel, a great night to talk

6
00:00:33,958 --> 00:00:39,000
about surveillance on the silver
screen with two of my favorite
folks to talk about these issues

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:46,708
with. On the end is Kevin
Bankston, who is at the New
America Foundation. You may have

8
00:00:46,708 --> 00:00:53,458
known him from previous starring
roles as CDT working on creative
expression and EFF for almost a

9
00:00:53,458 --> 00:01:00,625
decade. Working on privacy free
speech and new technology and
Kevin was also the lead council

10
00:01:00,625 --> 00:01:06,625
in NSA's AFS cases against the
NSA, post 2005 revelations. And
Tim Edgar who is currently at

11
00:01:10,458 --> 00:01:16,875
Brown and as an adjunct
Professor at Georgetown
University. Tim is going to

12
00:01:16,875 --> 00:01:22,750
bring a great perspective to
tonight's panel because he
actually worked in the belly of

13
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:28,750
the beast for a couple of years.
Both with Obama on national
security issues and the first

14
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,875
Deputy for Civil Liberties for
the Director of National
Intellegence from 2006 to 2009.

15
00:01:36,875 --> 00:01:41,625
So you can pause for a moment
and think about a couple of
things that may have happened

16
00:01:41,625 --> 00:01:47,958
related to surveillance between
2006 and 2009. So we have
supplied him with beer and

17
00:01:47,958 --> 00:01:52,417
hopefully he will be loose
lipped during the panel. ?	>>
[Laughter]. ?	>> There are no

18
00:01:52,417 --> 00:01:58,417
more secrets, unfortunately to
spill. ?	>> Or maybe later on at
parties. And I'm Nicole Lizzer,

19
00:02:02,625 --> 00:02:08,542
I'm the technology and Civil
Liberties Director for the ACLU
in California. I actually first

20
00:02:08,542 --> 00:02:13,542
developed this presentation
almost a decade ago when some of
the first revelations were

21
00:02:13,542 --> 00:02:18,458
coming out about the NSA and
Kevin and I did this
presentation at DEF CON about 5

22
00:02:18,458 --> 00:02:25,417
years ago where several of the
issues in here we thought were
still fiction. But post note, we

23
00:02:25,417 --> 00:02:30,792
have realized even more of it is
fact. So we're going to have a
fun time tonight sort of going

24
00:02:30,792 --> 00:02:36,333
through some of these clips and
talking about what's fact,
what's fiction, what's legal and

25
00:02:36,333 --> 00:02:40,833
hopefully having some nice
conversation and debate about
the issues. And we have a pretty

26
00:02:40,833 --> 00:02:45,958
short timeframe tonight, but we
do hope to be able to take a few
questions at the end or come up

27
00:02:45,958 --> 00:02:51,958
afterwards and we'll be happy to
talk. So we're going to start it
off with our first clip. You may

28
00:02:54,125 --> 00:03:01,167
recognize the people in this
movie.	 	>>	VIDEO: I don't know
if you guys should be talking so

29
00:03:01,167 --> 00:03:07,958
loud. ?	>> >> Oh Lisa, it's not
like anybody's listening to
everybody's conversations.

30
00:03:07,958 --> 00:03:14,292
[Music] ?	>> Hi, I'm calling
about your meat lovers' pizza. I
like it but don't know if I'm

31
00:03:14,292 --> 00:03:20,292
really ready to love it yet.
?	>> You hang up first. >> No,
you hang up first. ?	>> Okay.

32
00:03:23,458 --> 00:03:30,625
?	>> She hung up on me. ?	>> But
we're [indiscernible]. We should
just wait until we get to

33
00:03:30,625 --> 00:03:36,208
Seattle. ?	>> Hey, everybody, I
found one. The Government
actually found someone we're

34
00:03:36,208 --> 00:03:42,208
looking for. Yeah, baby, yeah!
?	>> I do love that clip. ?	>>
[Applause] ?	>> So this clip is

35
00:03:44,542 --> 00:03:51,708
a fun way to start things
because it illustrates where we
were just a few years ago, I

36
00:03:51,708 --> 00:03:57,958
think this was 2008- 2009 maybe.
Post revelations of the Bush era
warrant this wire tapping

37
00:03:57,958 --> 00:04:03,625
program by snowden. But even
then I think in pop culture and
real culture there was concern

38
00:04:03,625 --> 00:04:09,750
and anxiety about the bredth of
the NSA's abilities and also
questions about its

39
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:14,958
effectiveness. Like you're
collecting all of this hay, how
many needles are you actually

40
00:04:14,958 --> 00:04:20,500
finding in the hay? And that's
actually been a really critical
question because Snowden as

41
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:26,625
well. To pimp the work of my own
organization, The New America
Foundation, we recently released

42
00:04:26,625 --> 00:04:30,333
a couple of papers. One at the
beginning of the year about the
effectiveness, or lack thereof,

43
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:36,750
of the programs. Especially the
bulk records collection of phone
records where basically the

44
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:41,958
Government, it started with a
big inflated number of how many
cases the phone collection had

45
00:04:41,958 --> 00:04:47,292
helped. It's basically been
narrowed down to one case where
they convicted a cab driver in

46
00:04:47,292 --> 00:04:53,375
San Diego for donating less than
$10,000 to a Somali terror
group. So the question is, like

47
00:04:53,375 --> 00:05:00,000
is it worth collecting all of
our phone records for that
conviction? But also last week

48
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,083
we released a paper, you know if
you're going to talk about the
proported benefits of the

49
00:05:03,083 --> 00:05:07,458
programs, what about the cost of
the programs, not just the
privacy and civil liberties? And

50
00:05:07,458 --> 00:05:12,375
so we just released a paper at
our Open Technology Institute at
New America all about the costs

51
00:05:12,375 --> 00:05:18,375
of the NSA programs. ?	>> Whoa!
[Applause]. ?	>> Thank you. Not
only like the direct impact on

52
00:05:35,042 --> 00:05:39,333
the U.S. Internet industry but -
- . ?	>> [Off mic]. ?	>>
Goodness. Goodness gracious. I

53
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:44,125
thought you all were applauding
my paper. ?	>> [Off mic]. ?	>>
Thank you. ?	>> Wait, am I

54
00:05:44,125 --> 00:05:48,875
really doing this many? Is the
audience having them? ?	>> Drink
if you've got them. ?	>> This is

55
00:05:48,875 --> 00:05:53,750
very sweet. ?	>> I'm now
spilling shit on your paper.
?	>> See how many more relations

56
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:59,750
there will be tonight. ?	>>
Yeah. ?	>> We didn't even do the
HTTPS by default. ?	>> Who is

57
00:06:02,625 --> 00:06:08,625
the new speaker in this room
right now? >> Tim Edgar. First
time speaker. ?	>> Whoa!

58
00:06:14,292 --> 00:06:20,292
[Applause]. ?	>> Okay, now I'm
ready. ?	>> All right. Cheers!
?	>> Cheers! ?	>> [Applause].

59
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:36,375
?	>> Anyway we had our paper - -
oh, goodness - - so not just the
cost to American Internet

60
00:06:36,375 --> 00:06:43,500
industry and trust industry, but
also cost to our foreign
relations, cost to the security

61
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:47,375
of the internet itself, which I
think is really important and
not being talked enough about.

62
00:06:47,375 --> 00:06:52,500
But let's look at the next clip.
?	>> Oh, and I wanted to say one
other important piece in that

63
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:57,208
clip is that it's not just at
the NSA, but we see in that clip
local surveillance being rolled

64
00:06:57,208 --> 00:07:03,458
out in the buses and we have
seen billions of dollars come
down into local and state

65
00:07:03,458 --> 00:07:09,583
surveillance. So you sort of see
that confliction of issues. All
right, next for those who are

66
00:07:09,583 --> 00:07:17,083
familiar with this film The
Bourne Supremacy.	 	>>	VIDEO:
[Indiscernible]. ?	>> It looks

67
00:07:17,083 --> 00:07:23,083
like it's coming from a European
signal and [indiscernible]. ?	>>
Sir. >> What you got? >> We

68
00:07:28,417 --> 00:07:34,417
intercepted a call in London.
Key word black prime.	>> Okay,
send it to New York right away.

69
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:47,333
?	>> We have the phone
registered to London
[indiscernible]. >> You're

70
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:53,333
tracking him? >> Yes. >> Thanks,
Mike. >> We have a survey team
covering work and they're

71
00:07:58,042 --> 00:08:04,042
sneaking peeks on a way to the
quadrant. ?	>> How did you find
out about that? ?	>> I pulled

72
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:17,250
his background and ran a cross
check on any known anomalies but
I come up with nothing. I think

73
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:29,250
if we follow all
[indiscernible]. ?	>> The Bourne
Supremacy. Third in the Bourne

74
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:38,458
trilogy. As a civil libertarian,
this movie was like cinematic
crack to me because within the

75
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:43,833
space of a couple minutes, this
minute included, they mentioned
rendition or otherwise state

76
00:08:43,833 --> 00:08:50,500
sponsored kidnapping and
torture, sneak and peek searches
under the USA Patriot Act,

77
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:57,750
tracking cell phones and
Echelon. How many people in this
room know what Echelon is? And

78
00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:03,750
that's why I love DEF CON.
Echelon is the program, part of
a partnership of the U.S. and

79
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:13,250
the U.K. and Australia and New
Zealand and Canada where
basically their intelligence

80
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:16,792
services suck up every radio
signal on the planet. It's been
going on basically for decades.

81
00:09:16,792 --> 00:09:21,833
What's changed in the past 15
years or so is much of our
international communications,

82
00:09:21,833 --> 00:09:26,292
and therefore, these
intelligence communitie's
capabilities have transitioned

83
00:09:26,292 --> 00:09:33,458
to the wire, to the fiber
network. And so that means here
in the U.S., the NSA is sitting

84
00:09:33,458 --> 00:09:38,583
on our domestic backbone
network. Prior to 2008,
primarily under the President's

85
00:09:38,583 --> 00:09:43,917
own authority, that's what we
talked about as the wire tapping
program, since then under a law

86
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:51,125
called the FISA Amendment Act
and primarily section 702. Prism
is what you have heard of as 702

87
00:09:51,125 --> 00:09:54,500
survelience of cloud companies
and sending them targets and
getting stuff back from the

88
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:57,917
companies. But there's also -
and that's called downstream
collection. But there's also the

89
00:09:57,917 --> 00:10:03,792
upstream which is them sitting
on the network, which we really
have known about since 2005-

90
00:10:03,792 --> 00:10:10,417
2006 based on news report and
whistleblower Mark Klein from
AT&T, the secret room in San

91
00:10:10,417 --> 00:10:16,042
Francisco that was part of the
basis of EFF's lawsuits in this
area. But we've learned so much

92
00:10:16,042 --> 00:10:22,875
more post Snowden including
about how the Government picks
these things call selectors

93
00:10:22,875 --> 00:10:27,208
which are things that identify
their targets and those get
tasked to the machines that are

94
00:10:27,208 --> 00:10:33,500
sitting on the network and they
get fed back the data that they
want. So here the selector was

95
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:41,500
Black Briar the code name for a
program that trains assassins
like Matt Bourne? Jason Bourne.

96
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:47,500
Jason Bourne. It's been a while.
And so this is not fiction. This
is a capability that they have.

97
00:10:50,792 --> 00:10:55,667
Right now they are saying that
the selectors that they use for
upstream are just addresses and

98
00:10:55,667 --> 00:11:00,583
phone numbers. So they'll pull
everything that is to or from a
target or that mentions a target

99
00:11:00,583 --> 00:11:08,375
selector, but they say they are
not using key words in the
country under 702. There's also

100
00:11:08,375 --> 00:11:12,042
surveillance outside of the
country that's done only under
the President's authority

101
00:11:12,042 --> 00:11:17,375
without oversight by Congress,
without oversight by the FISA
Court under something called

102
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:23,125
EO12 333, Executive Order 12
333. So if you heard about them
cracking into Google and Yahoo's

103
00:11:23,125 --> 00:11:27,875
data links or sniffing a bunch
of address books and sniffing a
bunch of webcam photos outside

104
00:11:27,875 --> 00:11:33,625
the country, that's when and how
they're doing it. We don't know
if they are doing this kind of

105
00:11:33,625 --> 00:11:37,375
key word based searching outside
of the country, they very well
might, but they say they are not

106
00:11:37,375 --> 00:11:40,708
doing it inside the country
under 702, and of course the
Director of National

107
00:11:40,708 --> 00:11:45,542
Intellegence never lies. >> And
just a fun little fact and
fiction, I don't know how many

108
00:11:45,542 --> 00:11:50,583
people caught it, but it's
picking information from a
guardian reporter which is

109
00:11:50,583 --> 00:11:52,958
pretty prescedent with the
Snowden issues. So with all the
vast powers that the NSA has

110
00:11:52,958 --> 00:11:58,958
been gobbling up and the data
they have been pulling together,
what could happen? I'm sure they

111
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:11,417
wouldn't do anything wrong in
those issues. Here we've got an
oldie, but goody from the movie

112
00:12:11,417 --> 00:12:17,417
"Brazil." ?	>> I need some
information on a woman named
[indiscernible]. ?	>>

113
00:12:21,625 --> 00:12:27,625
[Indiscernible]. ?	>> Yes. I
know her age and distinguishing
marks, but I need an address or

114
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:36,000
place of work. ?	>>
[Indiscernible]. ?	>> When
there's a woman involved there's

115
00:12:38,375 --> 00:12:44,375
no stopping me. ?	>> So I'm sure
that the NSA wouldn't be using
its powers to look for love

116
00:12:50,333 --> 00:12:56,333
interests and I'm sure there
would also never be mistakes - .
?	>> [Music]. ?	>> Release the

117
00:13:03,833 --> 00:13:09,875
information. [Indiscernible].
Good evening, David. What do you
believe is behind this recent

118
00:13:09,875 --> 00:13:15,875
increase of terrorist bombings?
Bad sportsmanship. A ruthless
minority of people seems to have

119
00:13:18,042 --> 00:13:23,417
forgotten some good old-
fashioned virtue. They just
can't stand seeing the other

120
00:13:23,417 --> 00:13:29,083
fellow win. If these people were
just playing a game, they would
get a lot more out of life. >>

121
00:13:29,083 --> 00:13:35,625
Nevertheless Mr Helper, there
are those that believe the
administrative information could

122
00:13:35,625 --> 00:13:41,625
become too large. Free
information and society is the
name of the game you can't win

123
00:13:43,958 --> 00:13:49,958
the game if you're a match short
and the cost of it all, Deputy
Minister, 7% of the gross

124
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:59,875
national profit. ?	>> That's not
of our concern, it's the
taxpayers. People want value for

125
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:09,542
buck. That's why we always
insist on the principles of
information retrieval charge. >>

126
00:14:09,542 --> 00:14:15,542
You're absolutely right. Those
who want it should pay for their
queries and detection and for

127
00:14:17,875 --> 00:14:25,167
the information [indiscernible].
Do you believe that the
Government is willing to go to

128
00:14:25,167 --> 00:14:30,375
bat against terrorists?
[Indiscernible]. ?	>> Pretty
consistantly [Indiscernible] the

129
00:14:30,375 --> 00:14:36,375
critical system [indiscernible].
?	>> They are certainly not out
of the game. >> Mr Helper, the

130
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:45,500
bombing campaign is now in its
13th year. >> Beginners luck.
[Laughter]. ?	>> So, Tim, with

131
00:14:47,875 --> 00:14:52,667
all of the billions of dollars,
there's no misuse ever happening
within the system or any

132
00:14:52,667 --> 00:14:58,292
mistakes, right? ?	>> Right. So
actually this brings me back to
my days inside the belly of the

133
00:14:58,292 --> 00:15:03,125
beast doing oversight on
compliance issues at the NSA.
This is a very realisitic

134
00:15:03,125 --> 00:15:10,500
depiction of the kind of
compliance issues that we had to
address. The technology was only

135
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:14,958
slightly more obsolete than this
technology. ?	>> [Laughter].
?	>> No, so there were two types

136
00:15:14,958 --> 00:15:22,583
of compliance issues depicted in
these two clips and we
encountered both of them. The

137
00:15:22,583 --> 00:15:28,542
first one was what we call an
intentional violation. This is
when you used the surveillance

138
00:15:28,542 --> 00:15:33,708
apparatus for purposes that
would not be considered foreign
intelligence. Like, I'm

139
00:15:33,708 --> 00:15:38,667
interested in this woman. It
turns out it's not a requirement
under the National Intelligence

140
00:15:38,667 --> 00:15:44,208
priorities framework and,
therefore, is not a valid for
intellegence target and can get

141
00:15:44,208 --> 00:15:49,083
you in trouble if you are
discovered through our
compliance system. There were a

142
00:15:49,083 --> 00:15:54,958
relative handful of intentional
compliance violations that were
uncovered over about ten years.

143
00:15:54,958 --> 00:16:00,333
About 12 of them. And all of
them, I believe, involved love
interests, which perhaps isn't

144
00:16:00,333 --> 00:16:06,333
that surprising given human
nature. The term was loveint.
Like sigint or humint this was

145
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:15,250
loveint and it's not authorized.
The second one is a screw up.
This happened relatively more

146
00:16:17,333 --> 00:16:24,042
often. When you put in the wrong
IP address or the wrong phone
number or the wrong e- mail

147
00:16:24,042 --> 00:16:30,500
address and you collect
information on somebody who is
completely innocent because you

148
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:37,250
just put in the wrong numbers.
And those were also captured and
reported. There's a third type

149
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:40,333
that's not depicted in these
clips which are systemic
violations, that's when you

150
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:44,792
screw up the entire way in which
you collect the surveilence and
then you collect a lot of

151
00:16:44,792 --> 00:16:49,375
information beyond just the fly
landing in your computer. No,
you actually set the computer

152
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:55,375
system up, which is the one I
was actually most concerned
about. The one thing I would say

153
00:16:55,375 --> 00:17:01,000
in defense of the Government
here is that if you have a
system that is detecting these

154
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:08,292
violations and reporting them to
Congress and the FISA Court and
it is in fact, detecting

155
00:17:08,292 --> 00:17:13,750
violations and you are reporting
them, that is far better than a
system in which you say, we

156
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:21,042
don't have any violations. I was
always much more suspicious of
any program where the compliance

157
00:17:21,042 --> 00:17:27,250
record was 100% than I was of a
program that said, hey, we had
some pretty big problems setting

158
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:30,875
up it and then there were
violations and we reported them
and there were a couple of

159
00:17:30,875 --> 00:17:36,125
intentional misuses. That means
you're actually measuring your
violations and that's a good

160
00:17:36,125 --> 00:17:42,958
thing. ?	>> So then that really
sets up our next clip. When you
have immense power, what kinds -

161
00:17:42,958 --> 00:17:47,833
?	>> Before you start, I just
want to flag for those who have
not seen "Brazil" what happened

162
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:52,708
to Mr. Buttle. Mr. Buttle was
rendered and tortured into
death, so that's what happened

163
00:17:52,708 --> 00:17:58,417
as a result of that typo. An
innocent man was kidnapped by
his government and tortured to

164
00:17:58,417 --> 00:18:04,292
death. ?	>> So I am not going to
say that sort of thing never
happens because I think there

165
00:18:04,292 --> 00:18:10,292
have been very serious mistakes,
but all I would say is that
there's an important reason to

166
00:18:14,833 --> 00:18:21,125
be careful about what you do
with intelligence information
because if it's screwed up, then

167
00:18:21,125 --> 00:18:26,375
you're going to have a big
problem on your hands. And I
think that one of the things the

168
00:18:26,375 --> 00:18:31,792
NSA doesn't do is they don't do
things. They don't render
people. They don't, you know,

169
00:18:31,792 --> 00:18:36,792
they pass information along and
it's very important that the
other agencies understand that

170
00:18:36,792 --> 00:18:42,292
it's not perfect. ?	>> But when
you have technology that can
provide immense power, one of

171
00:18:42,292 --> 00:18:47,917
the big questions that has been
sort of raging since the Snowden
revelations is, is there proper

172
00:18:47,917 --> 00:18:52,625
oversight? Is there proper
channels to make sure that laws
being followed and do we

173
00:18:52,625 --> 00:18:58,042
actually have laws in place to
address issues that need to be
addressed? And this next clip

174
00:18:58,042 --> 00:19:04,042
does a good job of teeing up
some of that from "The Dark
Knight."	 	>>	VIDEO: Beautiful.

175
00:19:14,375 --> 00:19:20,375
Unethical. Dangerous. We've
turned every cell phone in
Gotham into a microphone. ?	>> A

176
00:19:23,708 --> 00:19:31,042
frequency generator receiver.
?	>> You took my sonar concept
and applied it to every phone in

177
00:19:31,042 --> 00:19:38,417
the city. And after
[indiscernible] sonar you can
image all of Gotham. ?	>>

178
00:19:38,417 --> 00:19:46,208
[Indiscernible]. ?	>> This is
wrong. ?	>> I've got to find
this man. ?	>> At what cost?

179
00:19:46,208 --> 00:19:52,208
?	>> The data base is encrypted
it can be only accessed by one
person. ?	>> This is too much

180
00:19:54,417 --> 00:20:00,417
power for one person. ?	>>
That's why I gave it to you.
Only you can use it. ?	>> Spying

181
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:09,958
on 30 million people isn't part
of my job description. ?	>>
[Indiscernible] you can

182
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:15,583
triangulate his position. ?	>>
[Indiscernible]. But consider
this my resignation. Along as

183
00:20:15,583 --> 00:20:21,583
there are these things at Wayne
Enterprises I won't be. ?	>> God
bless Morgan Freeman. Really.

184
00:20:25,125 --> 00:20:30,875
?	>> [Applause]. ?	>> If only he
existed in real life, right? I
mean, you know he does exist in

185
00:20:30,875 --> 00:20:36,292
real life, but you know what I
mean. The screen Morgan Freeman
who is infallible, if only he

186
00:20:36,292 --> 00:20:44,000
existed, but he doesn't. Instead
we have Diane Feinstein and the
FISA Court. So, I love this clip

187
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:49,292
because it is one of the most
potent and widely seen metaphors
for the moral conundrums that

188
00:20:49,292 --> 00:20:54,542
our intelligence community has
been put into post 9/11. And it
illustrates the need for, well

189
00:20:54,542 --> 00:21:01,417
first, the questioning of,
should anyone have the ability
to spy on 30 million or 300

190
00:21:01,417 --> 00:21:07,417
million or 6 billion people? And
if so, under what checks and
balances? I also think it's a

191
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:14,667
lot of fun because it's a great
mixture of actually plausible
technology and really stupid

192
00:21:14,667 --> 00:21:19,917
technology. ?	>> [Laughter] ?	>>
Because like owning your phone
and turning on the mic is

193
00:21:19,917 --> 00:21:23,125
possible. In fact we have seen
this, we've seen this Law
Enforcement investigations of

194
00:21:23,125 --> 00:21:29,250
the mafia. Like they get a
warrant and turn on the provider
assistance with the mic. We've

195
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:34,917
seen, you guys are well aware of
malware you can inject into a
phone or a computer to turn on a

196
00:21:34,917 --> 00:21:42,333
mic or a camera. And, you know,
there are voice printing for the
Joker. This capability does

197
00:21:42,333 --> 00:21:48,792
exist. The NSA does have that
capability. But I don't think
the phone network would actually

198
00:21:48,792 --> 00:21:54,000
deal really well with this. I
think if you opened every mic on
the phone network, it would

199
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,000
probably fall over and at the
very least the company would
know that it's happening. ?	>>

200
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,417
[Laughter]. ?	>> I don't think
Bruce would actually get away
with this one, which actually

201
00:22:02,417 --> 00:22:08,417
brings up a fun bit of trivia.
?	>> [Off mic]. ?	>> It's a
[indiscernible] violation. This

202
00:22:12,083 --> 00:22:18,042
brings up a great bit of trivia
which is assuming that this is a
Wiretap Act violation, and it

203
00:22:18,042 --> 00:22:22,083
is, I think that you open a mic
on somebody in a place where, in
a private space, that's an

204
00:22:22,083 --> 00:22:26,458
interception of their oral
communication, and if by doing
so you also hear their phone

205
00:22:26,458 --> 00:22:32,333
conversation, that's an
interception of an electronic
communication. If they actually

206
00:22:32,333 --> 00:22:37,208
caught, if a class action lawyer
actually found out about this
and sued Bruce Wayne, how much

207
00:22:37,208 --> 00:22:43,208
money do you think he would be
on the hook for??	>> [Off mic].
?	>> 20 bucks. If you assume 30

208
00:22:45,583 --> 00:22:51,583
million plaintiffs, that's 300
billion dollars because the
Wiretap Act has really huge

209
00:22:55,375 --> 00:23:01,667
statutory damages which is why
at EFF we brought a case that
would have cost the phone

210
00:23:01,667 --> 00:23:05,667
companies an enormous amount.
?	>> Or they would be liable for
nothing because they would hire

211
00:23:05,667 --> 00:23:10,542
really expensive lobbyists and
get immunity. Right? Boo! ?	>>
Right. Boo! Which is exactly

212
00:23:10,542 --> 00:23:16,375
what happened. ?	>> I'd like to
point out that it is Batman and
maybe they should have immunity

213
00:23:16,375 --> 00:23:20,917
just for this one time. ?	>> I
mean, it is Batman, it's not
like he's an emotionally

214
00:23:20,917 --> 00:23:25,375
crippled sociopath or anything.
?	>> [Laughter]. ?	>> But
anyway, I think this clip really

215
00:23:25,375 --> 00:23:32,625
raises - >> It's still Batman.
>> - an issue that we're going
to talk more about, which is, if

216
00:23:32,625 --> 00:23:39,042
this system, even though it's
spying on 30 million people is
only going to hit when it hears

217
00:23:39,042 --> 00:23:45,250
the Joker? Has it really
violated all those people's
privacy or is that targeted

218
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:51,167
enough that it doesn't violate
their privacy? ?	>> It's
critically important there are

219
00:23:51,167 --> 00:23:58,625
all these screens because that
indicates that each individual
phone has some kind of strange

220
00:23:58,625 --> 00:24:02,292
thing going on. That maybe if
they got rid of the screens, it
wouldn't violate privacy. ?	>>

221
00:24:02,292 --> 00:24:09,000
Yes. And then the crazy
technology is this sonar thing.
Maybe there's some weird milspec

222
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:13,500
stuff that's starting to do
stuff like that, but anyway.
?	>> And then the next clip

223
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:18,333
we're going to go into is both
surveillance is happening on
national security stage, but

224
00:24:18,333 --> 00:24:25,042
also surveillance that's
happening increasingly in local
law enforcement to surveil many,

225
00:24:25,042 --> 00:24:31,042
many people and that is cell
tracking. This is from the
company WeKeep which was the

226
00:24:34,375 --> 00:24:40,375
2012 [indiscernible]. ?	>>
Video: Where are you? >> You
don't need to know that right

227
00:24:43,208 --> 00:24:49,208
now. >> But why can't you just
tell me? >> You see, all I want
to know is - >> Are you ok? >>

228
00:25:03,792 --> 00:25:09,792
Everyone is mad at you. >> How
about you? Are you mad at
me??	>> Where are you? ?	>> I'll

229
00:25:21,792 --> 00:25:27,792
try to get back to you as soon
as I can. ?	>> Got him. He's
just off I94 near Gurney,

230
00:25:39,792 --> 00:25:45,792
Illinois. >> Send the
coordinates here. ?	>> Done.
?	>> You have a faulty light.

231
00:25:55,250 --> 00:26:01,250
?	>> Still tracking? ?	>> Yep.
?	>> [Sirens]. ?	>> He's just so
handsome. ?	>> [Laughter] ?	>>

232
00:26:06,167 --> 00:26:13,708
So this is a pretty
straightforward depiction of
cell phone tracking which can be

233
00:26:13,708 --> 00:26:21,000
done in a variety of ways and is
routinely done by local law
enforcement as well as the Feds

234
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:26,750
as well as the intelligence
community. Often done with some
level of precision by

235
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:30,667
triangulating your position
using cell towers. Or working
with the provider to turn on

236
00:26:30,667 --> 00:26:36,667
your GPS and track you with your
GPS. Or using MZ catchers, which
are basically fake base stations

237
00:26:40,167 --> 00:26:45,167
pretending to be your local cell
towers that follow you around in
vans and triangulate your

238
00:26:45,167 --> 00:26:52,125
position that way. It's still
very unsettled even though we've
been fighting about it in the

239
00:26:52,125 --> 00:26:58,417
courts for a decade whether the
Government needs warrants to do
this or can do it under a much

240
00:26:58,417 --> 00:27:04,125
easier to get type of court
order. We have probably 3 dozen
plus lower court decisions on

241
00:27:04,125 --> 00:27:10,083
the issue. The majority of them
require a warrant. But what we
hear is that most courts will

242
00:27:10,083 --> 00:27:13,292
still grant permission to do
this without a warrant. And in
the meant time, when the

243
00:27:13,292 --> 00:27:19,708
Government loses in these cases,
it chooses not to appeal so it
can avoid higher court opinions

244
00:27:19,708 --> 00:27:23,375
that would disagree with its
current practice. We have seen
higher court opinions on another

245
00:27:23,375 --> 00:27:30,083
issue which is access to stored
cell site location information,
information about which tower

246
00:27:30,083 --> 00:27:36,583
your phone is pinging, that the
phone company has in its logs.
There's a circuit split at this

247
00:27:36,583 --> 00:27:40,667
point. There was a 4th circuit
case, well first there was a 3rd
circuit case we litigated the

248
00:27:40,667 --> 00:27:46,542
EFF where the court held that
courts can require warrants, if
they choose to, under the

249
00:27:46,542 --> 00:27:51,708
statutes that applies here. A
4th circuit case said that the
Fourth Amendment does not

250
00:27:51,708 --> 00:27:57,500
protect this data. And most
recently an 11th circuit case
that included the ACLU holding

251
00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:02,958
that the Fourth Amendment did
protect this data. So it's still
kind of the Wild West and very

252
00:28:02,958 --> 00:28:08,583
unclear when and how the
statutes and the Fourth
Amendment protect your location

253
00:28:08,583 --> 00:28:12,917
against Government tracking.
?	>> So I will venture a
prediction here that much like

254
00:28:12,917 --> 00:28:18,917
gay marriage, the trend here is
very clear, that I believe that
within just a few years it will

255
00:28:21,417 --> 00:28:26,792
be very clear to everyone that,
in fact, you do need a warrant
for this kind of location

256
00:28:26,792 --> 00:28:31,375
tracking. That is the best
opinion inside the Government
and certainly inside the

257
00:28:31,375 --> 00:28:38,583
intelligence community. It's one
reason that there was an attempt
to limit the kind of data that

258
00:28:38,583 --> 00:28:42,917
NSA got to exclude cell phone
tracking data because of the
Fourth Amendment implications of

259
00:28:42,917 --> 00:28:47,583
that kind of domestic data. But
it really goes to this whole
problem of the courts catching

260
00:28:47,583 --> 00:28:52,625
up with technology. I mean the
older technology was less
precise and so some of those

261
00:28:52,625 --> 00:28:58,000
older cases may have made a
little bit more sense in terms
of having the looser standard.

262
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:02,958
But as that technology gets more
and more precise, it becomes
increasingly clear. And I think

263
00:29:02,958 --> 00:29:08,417
it's just - - you know, it's
unalterably clear right now that
you can't, should not be able to

264
00:29:08,417 --> 00:29:14,333
do this without a warrant. And,
you know, but it takes a while
for the courts to catch up. ?	>>

265
00:29:14,333 --> 00:29:18,583
I wish [indiscernible]
Intellectual property section
would take that on as the

266
00:29:18,583 --> 00:29:24,042
official position, but I agree
that that's the trend. I'll just
flag that the other problem here

267
00:29:24,042 --> 00:29:28,833
is simply that the level of
secrecy in regard to this type
of legal process has been a real

268
00:29:28,833 --> 00:29:33,250
hurdle. I mean we didn't even
know the Government was doing
this without warrants until 2005

269
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:38,792
and they had been doing it for a
long time. And so it's very hard
to, you know, you have to

270
00:29:38,792 --> 00:29:42,625
shadowbox trying to fight these
things and it's quite
frustrating. But the fight

271
00:29:42,625 --> 00:29:47,542
continues, including in Congress
where there are some proposals
to clearly require in statute

272
00:29:47,542 --> 00:29:52,458
that you get a warrant when you
track a cell phone. Those are
not moving as quickly as the

273
00:29:52,458 --> 00:29:56,000
proposals to make sure the
Governmnet gets a warrant before
seizing your e-mail. That's a

274
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,417
much simpler and easier to
message issue, and easier to
draft. ?	>> And for a long time

275
00:30:00,417 --> 00:30:06,458
of course the Government and the
telephone companies were very
happy to keep it a secret how

276
00:30:06,458 --> 00:30:12,125
often location information was
being sought and obtained and
Senator Markey, now Senator

277
00:30:12,125 --> 00:30:18,167
Markey, two years ago actually
sent letters to all the mobile
companies urging them, requiring

278
00:30:18,167 --> 00:30:22,625
them to respond about how many
demands they were getting. That
opened up some of the

279
00:30:22,625 --> 00:30:29,792
floodgates. And then the ACLU
actually did only our second
shareholder action ever last

280
00:30:29,792 --> 00:30:34,667
year. We did a shareholder
proposal against Verizon and
AT&T to pressure them to release

281
00:30:34,667 --> 00:30:39,583
their first transparency reports
which came out in January and of
course it revealed what we had

282
00:30:39,583 --> 00:30:44,833
long suspected, that these
companies were getting hundreds
of thousands of demands for

283
00:30:44,833 --> 00:30:50,250
location information every year.
Like one in ten of them were
with a warrant. That helps to

284
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:56,583
support not just the legislative
efforts to update the law, but
also policy efforts and creates

285
00:30:56,583 --> 00:30:59,958
pressure to create change.
Because obviously this is
incredibly sensitive

286
00:30:59,958 --> 00:31:06,625
information. Where you are, what
you are doing, who you know and
that kind of thing really needs

287
00:31:06,625 --> 00:31:12,833
to be well protected. ?	>> One
thing, one additional technique
or tactic that is worth noting

288
00:31:12,833 --> 00:31:17,167
that is actually reflected in
AT&T's transparency report, you
know, like I don't agree with

289
00:31:17,167 --> 00:31:22,792
ATT&T on everything, but this is
something they did good and that
they did better than Verizon and

290
00:31:22,792 --> 00:31:25,875
the other companies that were
transparency reporting at this
point, is that they specifically

291
00:31:25,875 --> 00:31:33,625
reported on the number of
requests they received for cell
dumps. A cell dump is when the

292
00:31:33,625 --> 00:31:40,917
Government asks for records of
every phone that pinged a
particular tower in a particular

293
00:31:40,917 --> 00:31:44,833
period. And the first really
prevalent case we heard of this
was in the the case of the

294
00:31:44,833 --> 00:31:52,083
scarecrow bandit, a bank robbery
gang. And what the Government
had done is gotten cell phones

295
00:31:52,083 --> 00:31:57,708
in all the towers near the banks
when they were being robbed and
then mined them to see if there

296
00:31:57,708 --> 00:32:03,167
were any in the location of the
banks at the time of all the
robberies. And it turns out that

297
00:32:03,167 --> 00:32:10,333
this is actually a very routine
technique that is typically done
without a warrant, but that

298
00:32:10,333 --> 00:32:13,750
necessarily results in the
Government collecting an
enormous amount of information

299
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:20,042
about people who are not, for
example, scarecrow bandits. But
we haven't yet had a really, you

300
00:32:20,042 --> 00:32:24,750
know, intense policy discussion
about what the standards should
be for that. What say, the

301
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:28,667
minimization practices should be
for the Government when that
happens? Like, when and how

302
00:32:28,667 --> 00:32:32,750
should they get rid of the data
they don't need after the case
is done? ?	>> And we have also

303
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:40,083
seen cell towers dumps tried to
be used in situations that are
clearly not bank robbers. There

304
00:32:40,083 --> 00:32:46,375
was an effort made to obtain all
the cell phones of a planned
labor protest. Those are the

305
00:32:46,375 --> 00:32:51,917
kind of things that really get
us very concerned about the use
of cell towers dumps

306
00:32:51,917 --> 00:32:57,917
particularly without proper and
adequate legal process. So we
will move on to - - uh- huh?

307
00:33:15,917 --> 00:33:19,458
?	>> [Off mic]. ?	>> It would
certainly change my legal
analysis, but one of the

308
00:33:19,458 --> 00:33:26,208
problems in this area is that
the law is just so inadequate in
describing what's allowed. If

309
00:33:26,208 --> 00:33:31,958
you're going to use a standard
sepina, for example, if you're
going to say to the company,

310
00:33:31,958 --> 00:33:36,167
these are business records that
you have created. Please give me
your business records. That's a

311
00:33:36,167 --> 00:33:41,792
fairly straightforward legal
tool. To do the much more
privacy protective technique

312
00:33:41,792 --> 00:33:46,500
that you are describing, would
obviously be much better from a
privacy standpoint, but that

313
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:52,458
requires the legislature,
Congress, you know, ACLU, the
police, to get together and have

314
00:33:52,458 --> 00:33:58,542
a debate and craft a statute
that says, okay, so cell tower
dumps, maybe for bank robbers,

315
00:33:58,542 --> 00:34:05,417
maybe with particular standards,
maybe with particular technology
will be okay, otherwise they are

316
00:34:05,417 --> 00:34:10,375
banned. And this is the kind of
debate we simply aren't having
in this country, and we need to

317
00:34:10,375 --> 00:34:16,917
have it. 	>> And as Tim said,
technology far outpaced a lot of
the privacy laws about

318
00:34:16,917 --> 00:34:24,125
electronic information have not
been meaningfully updated since
the 1980s. Before the web,

319
00:34:24,125 --> 00:34:29,292
before social networking, far
before when we were all carrying
cell phones. That's part of the

320
00:34:29,292 --> 00:34:34,250
real legislative fight that
we're having both on the Federal
level to update laws like the

321
00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:38,333
Electronic Communications
Privacy Act, about laws that are
regarding particular location

322
00:34:38,333 --> 00:34:45,542
information, and states as well
trying to pass laws to update
privacy protections for location

323
00:34:45,542 --> 00:34:51,458
information. We've had laws
passed in Montana, in Texas, in
Maine. We had a law that passed

324
00:34:51,458 --> 00:34:57,458
with strong bipartisan support
in California, but was vetoed by
the Governer. But we'll be back

325
00:34:59,750 --> 00:35:05,750
at it. All right, so next clip,
because we're going to try to
move along, minority reports.

326
00:35:09,625 --> 00:35:14,458
Tom Cruise in his heyday. ?	>>
Also handsome. ?	>> We can just
watch the whole movie.	

327
00:35:18,333 --> 00:35:24,333
	>>	VIDEO: [Sirens]. ?	>> We are
now in position and ready to
begin thermal scan on all of

328
00:35:31,542 --> 00:35:37,542
[indiscernible]. ?	>> That's why
you asked to partner with me on
this little [indiscernible].

329
00:35:42,417 --> 00:35:48,417
?	>> It's not that you don't
trust me to be along with
[indiscernible]. You think I

330
00:35:54,083 --> 00:36:00,083
might [indiscernible]. If I had
the chance - - . ?	>> I just let
them use your body

331
00:36:11,167 --> 00:36:17,167
[indiscernible] ?	>> So 27 warm
bodies. ?	>> Roger that,
confirmed 27 warm bodies. What

332
00:36:21,250 --> 00:36:27,250
do you think [indiscernible]?
?	>> Let's do [indiscernible].
?	>> [Indiscernible] ?	>>

333
00:36:35,250 --> 00:36:42,250
[Music]. ?	>> [Indiscernible]
authority 2264 [indiscernible]
?	>> Scanning [indiscernible].

334
00:36:42,250 --> 00:36:48,250
?	>> All right. Totally creepy.
So those of us up here would,
you know, clearly believe this

335
00:36:54,667 --> 00:37:00,667
is unconstitutional. It would be
unconstitutional. ?	>> And I
think Leo would believe it's

336
00:37:06,333 --> 00:37:12,333
unconstitutional. ?	>> Yes,
tresspass on the home, and even
Scalia would think this was

337
00:37:15,083 --> 00:37:20,458
unconstitutional. When the issue
of thermal imaging came up in
the [indiscernible] case, it was

338
00:37:20,458 --> 00:37:25,417
found to be unconstitutional
tresspass of the homes. Scalia
was particularly concerned about

339
00:37:25,417 --> 00:37:30,917
the fact that it would intrude
upon the privacy of the lady of
the house taking a bath, so he

340
00:37:30,917 --> 00:37:36,042
has sort of very strong feelings
about home and privacy within
the home. But one can imagine

341
00:37:36,042 --> 00:37:40,625
that is this future world that
the police may be making the
argument, look, we are not

342
00:37:40,625 --> 00:37:46,125
intruding upon anyone's privacy,
these are devices, we as
ourselves, as human beings

343
00:37:46,125 --> 00:37:53,875
didn't actually conduct a search
of these people and it wasn't
until these bots found Tom

344
00:37:53,875 --> 00:38:00,083
Cruise the perpetrator, that
that was indeed a search and he
had no reasonable expectation of

345
00:38:00,083 --> 00:38:06,250
privacy because he was the
perpetrator, therefore, no
Fourth Amendment violation. And

346
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:13,083
it seems like kind of a crazy
argument that all these people
whose privacy was invaded that

347
00:38:13,083 --> 00:38:18,750
were searched, their Fourth
Amendment rights were not
violated, we are actually seeing

348
00:38:18,750 --> 00:38:24,958
this kind of argument come up in
the electronic surveillance
context. ?	>> Right. Yeah, so I

349
00:38:24,958 --> 00:38:30,958
would agree that even general
Alexander would say it's
unconstitutional, but it's only

350
00:38:30,958 --> 00:38:37,250
unconstitutional because of the
invasion of the home. And what's
interesting to me, and we had a

351
00:38:37,250 --> 00:38:43,500
long discussion about this
before the panel, is when you
acquire data, there's a view

352
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:50,625
inside the Government, it's been
the view for decades now, that
that is not collected until a

353
00:38:50,625 --> 00:38:57,417
person actually looks at it.
It's certainly not a popular
view in this room or with civil

354
00:38:57,417 --> 00:39:02,542
libertarians, but it is, in
fact, the standard view of the
Government. And the reason for

355
00:39:02,542 --> 00:39:08,083
it is essentially the NSA goes
around, they vacuum up all sorts
of signals all over the world.

356
00:39:08,083 --> 00:39:12,917
They don't exactly know what
they've got in many cases. They
have to take it back to NSA and

357
00:39:12,917 --> 00:39:19,208
process it, and they say, hey,
we can't be considered to have
collected it until we have

358
00:39:19,208 --> 00:39:26,583
actully done something to it to
make it available to our
analysts to look at. And when I

359
00:39:26,583 --> 00:39:32,958
was applying these kind of rules
inside the intelligence
community and at the White

360
00:39:32,958 --> 00:39:39,458
House, that was the rule, that
was the internal rules that we
had to deal with. Just because

361
00:39:39,458 --> 00:39:44,125
those are the internal policies
though, doesn't mean that it is
consistent with the Fourth

362
00:39:44,125 --> 00:39:50,000
Amendment. And so you have to
analyze that question a little
bit differently. One question

363
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:55,000
for all of you, is to ask
yourself the question, "What is
the most creepy thing about this

364
00:39:55,000 --> 00:40:02,375
clip?". Is it the fact that they
could find Tom Cruise by
extracting this data from the

365
00:40:02,375 --> 00:40:07,458
people in the apartment? Or is
it the fact they did it in a
creepy way? ?	>> [Off mic]. ?	>>

366
00:40:07,458 --> 00:40:13,458
Because, you know, what if we
didn't need these creepy spiders
to be looking at little girls

367
00:40:13,458 --> 00:40:18,375
and making them cry? What if we
could just extract the data from
the Internet of things that were

368
00:40:18,375 --> 00:40:23,083
already in your house, that you
voluntarily put there in order
to save energy, and we just did

369
00:40:23,083 --> 00:40:29,250
it by typing a few key strokes,
you know, on a computer and
extracted it from a server

370
00:40:29,250 --> 00:40:35,417
somewhere far away from this
apartment building? Well, then
we're dealing with a much more

371
00:40:35,417 --> 00:40:41,667
murky question in which whether
it's Constitutional or not is
not really clear to a lot of

372
00:40:41,667 --> 00:40:48,167
people. ?	>> I think this raises
a couple of issues because there
are two threads of thought.

373
00:40:48,167 --> 00:40:52,625
Legal arguments that one can
imagine that basically count for
the proposition that it doesn't

374
00:40:52,625 --> 00:40:58,625
count until actually a person
looks. First and this would be
if I were trying to figure out

375
00:40:58,625 --> 00:41:02,667
how they thought this was legal
in the future considering our
current case law, is one, the

376
00:41:02,667 --> 00:41:07,500
case law would have had to have
changed, but two, there is case
law about dog sniffs where a

377
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:13,875
court has held that when a dog
sniffs your bag, even though the
contents in your bag is private

378
00:41:13,875 --> 00:41:19,000
and protected by the Fourth
Amendment, that is
Constitutional because the dog

379
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:24,792
is only going to alert on contra
band and you have no legitimate
privacy interest in your

380
00:41:24,792 --> 00:41:30,167
possession of contra band, and,
therefore, dog sniffs are
Constitutional even if not

381
00:41:30,167 --> 00:41:36,333
warranted. I think that's a
particularly weird conclusion,
particularly considering that it

382
00:41:36,333 --> 00:41:41,583
is legislatures that decides
what counts as contra band. So
to have legislatures have the

383
00:41:41,583 --> 00:41:47,417
ability to decide what is a
Constitutional search is kind of
weird. If I had to guess the

384
00:41:47,417 --> 00:41:54,125
legal rationale for this was,
that well this is only going to
detect a fugitive, Tom Cruise,

385
00:41:54,125 --> 00:42:02,000
and otherwise won't reveal any
particulars of the home,
therefore, it's Constitutional.

386
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:09,708
But then there is also this
thread of this isn't so much in
the case of legal case law, but

387
00:42:09,708 --> 00:42:13,667
it is apparent in the way the
Government talks about it. Is
that terms of privacy violation,

388
00:42:13,667 --> 00:42:17,625
in terms of, you know, how we
define what an intrusion is on
your expectation of privacy,

389
00:42:17,625 --> 00:42:21,125
what counts as an interception
of your communication, they seem
to be following rules that

390
00:42:21,125 --> 00:42:25,125
imply, well, it doesn't really
count until a person looks at it
or at the very least, until we

391
00:42:25,125 --> 00:42:31,167
store it. But what we are
looking at and what we have been
looking at since we first found

392
00:42:31,167 --> 00:42:37,167
out about it in December of 2005
is a network of machines that
are sitting on top of our

393
00:42:37,167 --> 00:42:44,542
domestic network that the NSA is
directly querying specific
targets, and all of our bits are

394
00:42:44,542 --> 00:42:50,917
going into the boxes and they
are able to pull what they want
from those boxes. And I would

395
00:42:50,917 --> 00:42:56,000
say that EFF's position, when I
worked there, and now is
reflected in the motion they

396
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:02,792
just filed against the NSA, one
of their cases against the NSA,
is that as soon as your bits go

397
00:43:02,792 --> 00:43:09,083
into a box that is packed by the
Government, that's a search of
those bits, that's a seizure, of

398
00:43:09,083 --> 00:43:13,458
those bits. And that's a
violation of the statue of
limitation in electronic

399
00:43:13,458 --> 00:43:19,500
surveillance. This is also the
same position that I've been
working on in an academic paper

400
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:24,833
on with another lawyer, Amy
Stopanovitch at the organization
of AccessNow.org, and you can

401
00:43:24,833 --> 00:43:31,833
Google for that and look at it.
I think if you read that and
EFF's new brief, you will get a

402
00:43:31,833 --> 00:43:36,250
good idea of what the argument
is in terms of, whether it
counts if the robot looks at it.

403
00:43:36,250 --> 00:43:41,125
And actually the title of the
paper is, "When robot eyes are
watching". And so I think this

404
00:43:41,125 --> 00:43:46,833
question of, at what point do we
draw the line on the privacy
invasion? Is it when the bits go

405
00:43:46,833 --> 00:43:51,917
into the box? Is it when the box
stores the bits? Is it when the
box sends the bits to the NSA?

406
00:43:51,917 --> 00:43:56,417
Is it when those bits are
rendered into human intelligable
form? Is it when a human

407
00:43:56,417 --> 00:44:01,250
actually reads them? It when a
human reads them and prepares
them for an analyst to pay

408
00:44:01,250 --> 00:44:06,792
attention to them? And how you
draw that line is really
important. I would say that,

409
00:44:06,792 --> 00:44:12,375
think back to that Simpson's
clip and you have all of these
NSA functionaries listening to

410
00:44:12,375 --> 00:44:17,083
all these really intimate
things. And you know what they
look like? They look bored

411
00:44:17,083 --> 00:44:20,875
because if you were actually
doing this with human beings,
and trying to pay attention to

412
00:44:20,875 --> 00:44:25,000
all the stuff, you would just be
listening to communication after
communication. You would'nt get

413
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,750
titillated about it, just like
your doctor who has seen
everybodies bits. Other bitsn

414
00:44:27,750 --> 00:44:32,833
not digital bits. >>[Laughter]
You going to hear so much stuff
through the day you will have

415
00:44:32,833 --> 00:44:38,833
forgotten most of the time when
you leave for the day. Yet
everyone would say, looking at a

416
00:44:41,042 --> 00:44:48,458
human being, that would be a
search, that would be a seizure,
that would be an interception or

417
00:44:48,458 --> 00:44:54,833
electronic surveillance, so the
question becomes, how is it
different, how is it less worse

418
00:44:54,833 --> 00:45:00,958
if we automate that? And I would
actually say that, if you are
automating it, you are making it

419
00:45:00,958 --> 00:45:05,750
that much worse because that
Army of people that you could
never afford to listen to

420
00:45:05,750 --> 00:45:11,750
everybody, you now have it,
except it's an Army of robots.
?	>> [Off mic]. ?	>> Oh! That's

421
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:20,583
a good question. ?	>> Can you
repeat the question? ?	>> No,
no, the question was, what about

422
00:45:20,583 --> 00:45:26,583
the hash of the bits? So there
is one theory, actually there's
a person who wrote a good

423
00:45:29,667 --> 00:45:36,375
article, [indiscernible] yahoo
and now chief Law Enforcement
dude at Google, which takes, in

424
00:45:36,375 --> 00:45:43,625
general, very strong positions
on this stuff. He wrote a paper
analogizing the searching of the

425
00:45:43,625 --> 00:45:49,500
data stream or a computer for
hashes of known child porn. He
analogizes that to dog sniffs,

426
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:56,625
and suggested that a search of a
data stream or a drive for
hashes of child porn would be

427
00:45:56,625 --> 00:46:03,333
analogous to a dog sniff because
similarily, it would only detect
that contra band. And, in fact,

428
00:46:03,333 --> 00:46:08,250
we just saw this in the news
just this past week when it was
revealed, not revealed, I mean

429
00:46:08,250 --> 00:46:15,042
we knew this was happening, that
Google does in fact use as do
other cloud companies and I fear

430
00:46:15,042 --> 00:46:21,042
some of the ISPs, use a database
of hashes of images that the
NCMEC, or National Center for

431
00:46:25,125 --> 00:46:31,875
Missing and Exploited Children
has concluded are child porn. I
expect most of those images are

432
00:46:31,875 --> 00:46:37,958
child porn, however, it is of
concern, speaking generally,
that a quasi-Governmental entity

433
00:46:37,958 --> 00:46:45,833
is providing the private actors
a list of expression, photos
that they believe are illegal

434
00:46:45,833 --> 00:46:50,250
and not protected by the First
Amendment, but that no court has
adjudicated to be illegal and

435
00:46:50,250 --> 00:46:54,167
unprotected by the First
Amendment and that means
providers of our communication

436
00:46:54,167 --> 00:47:01,333
services are voluntarily
scanning for that and reporting
that. ?	>> So I think there's a

437
00:47:01,333 --> 00:47:06,208
legally significant difference
between searching the streams of
communications for selectors

438
00:47:06,208 --> 00:47:11,083
that apply to particular people
that you have determined through
some process lawfully under

439
00:47:11,083 --> 00:47:18,625
surveillance and looking for
hashes of images or content of
communications because this is

440
00:47:18,625 --> 00:47:24,042
an area where Tim and I would
agree, because I actually think
that that is a search because

441
00:47:24,042 --> 00:47:28,792
you are, in fact, trying to find
out if every one of those
communications contains this

442
00:47:28,792 --> 00:47:33,792
particular content, as opposed
to trying to pick out which
communtcation belongs to this

443
00:47:33,792 --> 00:47:39,208
individual that I have decided
I'm going to surveil. But it's a
fascinating question because one

444
00:47:39,208 --> 00:47:45,667
difference between the hash
search and dog sniff is that
actually, the hash search is

445
00:47:45,667 --> 00:47:51,208
probably a lot more accurate
than the dog sniff. That was one
of the big problems of the dog

446
00:47:51,208 --> 00:47:56,458
sniff case, is that it assumes
the dog is always 100% accurate
and only alerted when there is

447
00:47:56,458 --> 00:48:01,833
contra band. Which is not true.
?	>> I'm sorry, we're going to
run out of time. I just want to

448
00:48:01,833 --> 00:48:07,917
say we'll take questions at the
end, but this issue is just
incredibly essential because if

449
00:48:07,917 --> 00:48:12,042
all of our lives are now
digital, are we going to have
this service collective reality

450
00:48:12,042 --> 00:48:18,292
of both local law enforcement
and national security and then
the Fourth Amendment doesn't

451
00:48:18,292 --> 00:48:23,292
apply, so at the very end when
there's probable cause to do
something so it completely

452
00:48:23,292 --> 00:48:28,042
circumvents the Fourth Amendment
potentialy. So, this is a really
essential question, not just

453
00:48:28,042 --> 00:48:33,375
with physical surveillance, but
in terms of everything from dog
sniffs to sting rays and

454
00:48:33,375 --> 00:48:38,250
electronic surveillance. So this
is something we should have a
whole panel on at another DEF

455
00:48:38,250 --> 00:48:43,292
CON. >> Would there be intrest
in that? >> We were going to
show one more clip for "Enemy of

456
00:48:43,292 --> 00:48:49,292
the State." Do you think we have
time to show the last one? ?	>>
We do. Yeah, one more clip. ?	>>

457
00:48:55,458 --> 00:49:01,458
One more clip for "Enemy of the
State." And then we will move on
to talking about change and

458
00:49:05,625 --> 00:49:11,625
solutions. This is "Enemy of the
State" pre- 9/11. Sorry about
that. ?	>> Oh. What is going on?

459
00:49:15,417 --> 00:49:21,417
?	>> I'm going to say there is a
little bit of a problem. ?	>>
Okay, here we go. ?	>> I'll save

460
00:49:26,375 --> 00:49:32,375
it.	 	>>	VIDEO: Come on. Come
on, all right. Get that

461
00:49:37,917 --> 00:49:43,917
There's no problem with that.
Oh, God damn it. What the hell
are you doing here? This is not

462
00:49:48,042 --> 00:49:54,667
the office. This is my private
time. ?	>> 5 minutes. ?	>> No! I
said no Tuesday, I said no last

463
00:49:54,667 --> 00:50:00,833
week, I'm going to keep saying
no until you hear me ?	>> This
is Jim. All I ask is 5 minutes.

464
00:50:00,833 --> 00:50:08,292
Do you want some coffee? ?	>>
No, I don't want coffee. I want
to play with my dog. ?	>> I'm

465
00:50:08,292 --> 00:50:14,542
not asking you to vote for it. I
know you can't. Just release
your people. Let them go the way

466
00:50:14,542 --> 00:50:20,542
they want ?	>> Telecommunication
Security and Privacy Act. Did
you see the post? This bill is

467
00:50:26,333 --> 00:50:31,500
not the first step for the
surveillance society, it is the
surveillance society. ?	>>

468
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:35,958
[Indiscernible] ?	>> Listen, I'm
not going to sit in Congress and
pass a law that lets the

469

microphone at anything they damn
well please. ?	>> So, look, I

470
00:50:42,625 --> 00:50:48,458
don't care who bangs who, what
type of officers get stoned, but
this the richest most powerful

471
00:50:48,458 --> 00:50:53,042
nation on Earth and therefore,
the most hated and you and I
know what the average citizen

472
00:50:53,042 --> 00:50:59,292
does not that we are at war 24
hours of every day. ?	>> Yeah,
yeah, yeah. ?	>> Do I have to

473
00:50:59,292 --> 00:51:04,667
itemize the number of American
lives we've saved in the past 12
months along with judicious use

477
00:51:21,625 --> 00:51:27,167
I'm not talking about campign
contributions damn it. What
about my constituents being out

478
00:51:27,167 --> 00:51:33,167
of work. Jesus, man, wake up.
National security isn't the only
thing going on in this country.

This conversation is over. ?	>>

change. ?	>> You've got a point

00:52:06,333 --> 00:52:13,375
there, sweetie. ?	>> I mean, who
is this idiot? ?	>> He is
talking about ending personal

484
00:52:13,375 --> 00:52:18,208
privacy. Do you want your phone
tapped? ?	>> I'm not planning on
blowing up the country. ?	>>

485
00:52:18,208 --> 00:52:23,542
Well how do we know until we
have heard all your dirty little
secrets? ?	>> You are just going

486
00:52:23,542 --> 00:52:28,583
to have to trust me ?	>> Oh, I
know, we'll just tap the
criminals, we won't suspend the

487
00:52:28,583 --> 00:52:34,708
civil rights of the good people.
?	>> Right. ?	>> Then who
decides which is which? ?	>> I

488
00:52:34,708 --> 00:52:40,583
think you should. ?	>> Bobby, I
think you should take this more
seriously. ?	>> Honey, I think

489
00:52:40,583 --> 00:52:46,500
you are taking it seriously
enough for both of us, and half
the people on the block. ?	>>

490
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:51,458
Tens of millions of nationals
live within our borders and many
of these people consider the

491
00:52:51,458 --> 00:52:57,750
United States their enemy. And
they see acts of terrorism. ?	>>
So, I love this clip because the

492
00:52:57,750 --> 00:53:03,750
wife plays an ACLU lawyer in
this movie, so it's particularly
close to my heart. But some

493
00:53:05,792 --> 00:53:11,792
similar phrases going on in this
movie, that we have heard since
9/11. ?	>> One bit of context,

494
00:53:15,083 --> 00:53:21,083
that first scene, that is the
NSA Director trying to convince,
the Chairman of the Senate

495
00:53:30,875 --> 00:53:34,875
intelligence committee to
support their bill. It's the
first scene of the movie and

496
00:53:34,875 --> 00:53:39,458
what happens at the end of it is
the NSA assassinates the
Chairman of the Senate

497
00:53:39,458 --> 00:53:44,625
intelligence committee. I don't
think the NSA would do that. You
know, it's a bit out there, but

498
00:53:44,625 --> 00:53:50,042
I don't know. ?	>> So the NSA
doesn't engage in those kinds of
operations. That would be other

499
00:53:50,042 --> 00:53:54,625
parts of the Government that do
that. They would object very
strongly to the NSA turf

500
00:53:54,625 --> 00:53:58,917
grabbing, if the NSA planned the
asassination. ?	>> [Laughter].
?	>> But obviously the

501
00:53:58,917 --> 00:54:05,167
similarities to the Patriot Act
and the [Indiscernible] Act, and
now we see post Snowden some

502
00:54:05,167 --> 00:54:11,042
moving back from that, some real
movement in DC to reinsert some
important safeguards, and so we

503
00:54:11,042 --> 00:54:17,000
want to end sort of on a note of
what we see moving and optimism,
about what we see potientially

504
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:23,208
happening and adress what has
occured since 9/11. The concerns
that many civil libertarians and

505
00:54:23,208 --> 00:54:29,208
many members of the public have
had about over-reach, about
over-abuse, lack of safeguards,

506
00:54:29,208 --> 00:54:34,500
lack of checks and balances.
?	>> Yeah, so there is this
bill, the USA Freedom Act that

507
00:54:34,500 --> 00:54:39,000
was really great and then it was
really awful and now it's
better, but not awesome, but

508
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:43,958
still good enough to acutally
change the laws in some really
good ways. And we're hoping that

509
00:54:43,958 --> 00:54:51,000
we can try and move it before
the election when Congress comes
back in September. But I just

510
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:56,750
wanted to flag another thing
that, you know, I think of when
I watch this clip which is going

511
00:54:56,750 --> 00:55:00,708
back to the paper we wrote last
week, but also [indiscernible]
talk, if you saw it yesterday.

512
00:55:00,708 --> 00:55:06,708
Which is too often the debate
here has boiled down to a pretty
simplistic argument about

513
00:55:09,208 --> 00:55:16,125
security or purported security
benifit, and cost comprivacy
libirties when really we're not

514
00:55:16,125 --> 00:55:20,917
interrogating the benefits
nearly enough, and we are not
actually looking broadly enough

515
00:55:20,917 --> 00:55:26,042
at all of the various costs, not
just comprivacy civil libirties,
but the literal cost - - how

516
00:55:26,042 --> 00:55:32,792
much money is spent on this
stuff? Which the budget is huge.
But, you know, the cost industry

517
00:55:32,792 --> 00:55:38,250
now that it's known the cost to
Internet security forpolations,
the cost to the agenda around

518
00:55:38,250 --> 00:55:42,667
the world, the cost to our
credibility, we need to have a
more nuance conversation of pros

519
00:55:42,667 --> 00:55:49,833
and cons here. ?	>> And some of
those costs I think are the
reasons why President Obama

520
00:55:49,833 --> 00:55:55,833
issued this PPD28 which makes
some pretty modest reforms, but
conceptuially was a lead for the

521
00:55:58,583 --> 00:56:04,583
intellegence community, for the
first time pretty much ever,
this Presidential directive

522
00:56:06,792 --> 00:56:11,417
acknowledges the rights and
interests beyond the United
States citizens to include

523
00:56:11,417 --> 00:56:17,042
foreign citizens as well and
part of the reason for that, I'd
like to think it's just because

524
00:56:17,042 --> 00:56:20,833
it's the right thing to do, but
I think part of the reason for
that is because of pressure from

525
00:56:20,833 --> 00:56:25,708
the technology industry that
says, hey, when you guys go out
there and say we have got these

526
00:56:25,708 --> 00:56:30,750
protections for U.S. citizens,
that doesn't really help us very
much in the global marketplace.

527
00:56:30,750 --> 00:56:38,042
You know, these revelations are
extremely damaging to the U.S.
position as a technology leader.

528
00:56:38,042 --> 00:56:44,042
And so it's in my strong view
that one concequence of the
recent controversy will be and

529
00:56:46,125 --> 00:56:51,417
should be is the increased
understanding that we need to
have privacy protections for

530
00:56:51,417 --> 00:56:57,375
everyone and not just for
Americans. ?	>> And also seeing
members of Congress directly

531
00:56:57,375 --> 00:57:01,792
challenging the intelligence
community, as we saw in this
clip, you know, the Director of

532
00:57:01,792 --> 00:57:06,708
the NSA saying, do I need to
recount all the ways that this
has been useful to us and

533
00:57:06,708 --> 00:57:13,042
addressing terrorism? And we see
now, real challenges by members
of Congress saying, no, like

534
00:57:13,042 --> 00:57:19,750
Senator Wyden saying, I don't
see any evidence that has led to
information that we couldn't

535
00:57:19,750 --> 00:57:25,625
have obtained in far less
intrusive constutional ways. So
not just taking at face value,

536
00:57:25,625 --> 00:57:31,917
you know, the issues that this
is necessary or it's necessary
to be done in these invasive and

537
00:57:31,917 --> 00:57:37,625
unconstitutional ways. I think
that that's a huge shift in
thinking in something that is

538
00:57:37,625 --> 00:57:42,542
really important for the debate
going forward. I want to be
mindful of our time, of all of

539
00:57:42,542 --> 00:57:46,625
you in the audience, of my
fellow panelists. I want to
thank you guys for coming on

540
00:57:46,625 --> 00:57:54,500
Saturday night. And please
follow - us. Get engaged in the
work that each of our

541
00:57:54,500 --> 00:58:00,500
organizations are doing. And
thank you very much. We hope to
see you next year at DEF CON.
