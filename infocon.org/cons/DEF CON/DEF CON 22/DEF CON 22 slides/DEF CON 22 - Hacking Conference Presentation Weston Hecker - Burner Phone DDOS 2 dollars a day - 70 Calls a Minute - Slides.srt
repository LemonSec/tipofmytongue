1
00:00:00,125 --> 00:00:05,625
>> The basic topic of my talk is
the bruner phone DDoS. It was a
two dollar a day experiment with

2
00:00:05,625 --> 00:00:11,958
on of the Verizon plans that I,
uh, found, so.. It makes about
70 calls per minute depending on

3
00:00:11,958 --> 00:00:18,042
the actual towers that it's on,
so.. And the I I have it
migrating, and I'll go through

4
00:00:18,042 --> 00:00:22,917
that pretty quick here so. Okay,
who am I? And what is this talk
about? I don't like this part.

5
00:00:25,833 --> 00:00:30,417
It's a little bit about me, I've
done pen testing for ten years.
I went through geoscience in

6
00:00:30,417 --> 00:00:34,167
geophysics. Got tons of certs.
Nobody cares.   ‑ ‑   ‑ ‑
Reservation buzzing. About nine

7
00:00:34,167 --> 00:00:39,833
years of pen testing as I said.
Tons of compliance. Tools of the
trade, I'm going to go over some

8
00:00:39,833 --> 00:00:45,833
actual devices that are really
nice compared to a rubber ducky.
So, creation of call bombing.

9
00:00:49,625 --> 00:00:55,625
That's what I'm going to go over
with here. And I'm going to do a
demonstration here and here's

10
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,208
the  ‑ ‑ does anybody use rubber
duckies on any sort of pen
testing audits or things like

11
00:01:15,208 --> 00:01:22,333
that? Anybody play around with
ten (indiscernible) 3.0? Yeah.
If you combine the two in an

12
00:01:22,333 --> 00:01:27,333
iPhone SXISHGS do have plans if
you guys want to use one. And
all it tacks is a HAET gun. It

13
00:01:27,333 --> 00:01:33,333
works a lot better than the
plastic USB. This is an R[F]D
badger. It's a (indiscernible)

14
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:48,375
center to it. When they move in
the chair, right now it beeps.
Every time they scan their card.

15
00:01:48,375 --> 00:01:54,833
It's not cog knee toe, but it
definitely gets the job done.
Okay, right at security

16
00:01:54,833 --> 00:02:00,917
convention, I'm just going to go
over these quickly also. Denial
service is when legitimate

17
00:02:00,917 --> 00:02:08,417
services of any kind are denied
to people sending false or over
flow of information. Telephone

18
00:02:08,417 --> 00:02:14,542
denial service is  ‑ ‑ I haven't
seen as much of it on the wild
as I thought I would. Especially

19
00:02:14,542 --> 00:02:18,750
the incidents we've seen
throughout the years and a lot
of the activism type stuff. And

20
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:24,750
basically calls up, there's a
[P]RI. A lot of people don't
have telephone service for the

21
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:31,792
most part anymore. Most of it's
getting switched (indiscernible)
and computerized services.

22
00:02:31,792 --> 00:02:35,875
That's something that is
definitely in the wake now
that's it's more on the

23
00:02:35,875 --> 00:02:41,875
internet. Instances of [T] dots
that I have seen in the wild is
bank fraud. Present theft. For

24
00:02:43,917 --> 00:02:51,583
example if my card was being
used in Texas at some gas
station of some choice, Wells

25
00:02:51,583 --> 00:02:56,917
Fargo will actually try to call
me. And the current reasons I've
seen that is they actually TDOS

26
00:02:56,917 --> 00:03:01,542
people's phones on some of the
(indiscernible) port parts.
Let's see, bank transfer mule

27
00:03:01,542 --> 00:03:09,333
scams, that's going on in LA and
California a lot. Where they tie
up the phone [lines on the call

28
00:03:09,333 --> 00:03:15,333
center for the actual banks. And
unintentional spooked caller ID
scamming. That's one of the

29
00:03:18,375 --> 00:03:24,375
biggest ones. That's the reason
I'm here is because a couple
years back, I came across using

30
00:03:26,542 --> 00:03:31,500
three calls in the morning right
before I moveed to Minneapolis.
It was a new phone number so I

31
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:37,708
was assumed it was a call of the
previous owner put themselves in
some sort of system, but when I

32
00:03:37,708 --> 00:03:43,708
called back, it had a spoofed
caller ID. So there was this old
man in I think Delaware that was

33
00:03:45,917 --> 00:03:51,917
getting probably, close to a
hundred forty calls a day. I did
call him later in the even and

34
00:03:59,292 --> 00:04:05,292
he said he was changing his
number. There are government
facilities  ‑ ‑   ‑ ‑ that are

35
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:13,000
getting tons of actual
illegitimate calls and it's
tieing up their lines of

36
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:19,000
service. So political motivated
act VICHL. I have seen a little
bit about it in the wild and I

37
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:26,917
hear about it in the news all
the time. Here's the current
methods of TDOS. The caller ID

38
00:04:26,917 --> 00:04:33,375
redirections. That's one that
I'm going to go over in some
brief detail. There's actual

39
00:04:33,375 --> 00:04:38,250
mall ware on phones. ‑ ‑   ‑ ‑
umm, the most of the methods
right now. (Audio stopped.) That

40
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:40,250
are being used are actually
hijacked [P]RI and
(indiscernible) services.

41
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:42,250
Provided sip services. So script
loaded. That's the last one I'm
going to go over actually, it

42
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:44,250
basically loads phone numbers
into pregenerated web pages, and
it's pretty decent. And as far

43
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:46,250
as actually. (Audio stopped.)
Very little work. So the first
one I'm going to go over is the

44
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:48,250
caller ID reflection attack.
There's spoof caller IDs, apps
on the phone that is call the

45
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:50,250
servers, things like that. I'm
sure everyone's got a blocked
number or a friend that's

46
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:52,250
messing with you one day.
Basically, with this one [P]RI
server you can make 23 calls

47
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:54,250
second to people. You can cycle
through lists depending on what
the actual software running on

48
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:56,250
your computer would be, and it
would IE tie into a soft phone
situation. And call literally

49
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:58,250
hundreds of people and they'll
call whoever the spoof caller ID
person. And they'll believe

50
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:00,250
that's the actual person who
called them. A lot of them
won't, I don't call back a

51
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:02,917
number if they don't leave a
voice mail. And (indiscernible)
TDOS for you. So what this does

52
00:05:02,917 --> 00:05:06,792
is an actual script that hold
several thousand  ‑ ‑ I think it
was 46 or 4800 actual Realtor

53
00:05:06,792 --> 00:05:09,250
web pages. (Indiscernible)
captions. (Indiscernible)
V[S][P] exact of the lot of the

54
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:13,958
same stuff in them. Very easy to
generate. You put the
information into your text

55
00:05:13,958 --> 00:05:17,833
fields and as you can see, right
here, it'll actually put a name,
phone number, things like that.

56
00:05:17,833 --> 00:05:23,375
So, that's one of the instances
of getting TDOS in. And here's a
list of the header. They're a

57
00:05:23,375 --> 00:05:29,375
little bit larger. So people can
see it. And yeah, like I was
saying about 76 of the web pages

58
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:44,000
out there have  ‑ ‑ they use
pretty much the same template or
a pretty close version of the

59
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,375
actual. And I just wrote a box
of the web pages searching for
key words. Anything with

60
00:05:49,375 --> 00:05:54,750
millions numbers. That's why I
chose Realtors. It's specific to
them so. So yeah, bot nets are

61
00:05:54,750 --> 00:06:00,458
infected smart phones. There are
a couple out there. This is just
kind of natural. The next is

62
00:06:00,458 --> 00:06:04,917
smart devices. So, if there is
an increase on the
(indiscernible) phones you all

63
00:06:04,917 --> 00:06:11,250
know. That's one of the risk, we
gladly take. I want to go into
now how I weaponized the OAM

64
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:16,625
cell phone. The prepaid cell
phone we're talking about is
actually a Sam sung U 365. I'm

65
00:06:16,625 --> 00:06:22,042
sure everyone at some point in
their life has actually owned
one of them. They're very common

66
00:06:22,042 --> 00:06:26,792
phone. So if they're running the
brew 3.1 operating system
digital service. It's a really,

67
00:06:26,792 --> 00:06:32,500
really nice phone, I think they
cost about $eight for Verizon,
and you can buy them for $12.

68
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:37,625
And the actual chips that's in
it, that's one of the reasons I
was able to do the exploit. Most

69
00:06:37,625 --> 00:06:43,625
of the smart phones out there
have application processes.
These have one single 100 mega

70
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:56,458
hertz processer. And the actual
attack would work on any value
chip set. So any of the U[S]C

71
00:06:56,458 --> 00:07:04,042
6050 and 6055. So. Here's a
little bit of personal research
I've got here. So yeah. Yeah so,

72
00:07:04,042 --> 00:07:11,208
they have other nefarious uses
aside from [T] dots. And D dots.
And there were three security

73
00:07:11,208 --> 00:07:17,542
features that were built into
the the device. And umm, the
developer editions of these

74
00:07:17,542 --> 00:07:23,417
models support American
unlocked. Feature sets and I
think thises like that. So what

75
00:07:23,417 --> 00:07:31,042
I basically did is wrote custom
firmware for the device. And I
will talk about the way I was

76
00:07:31,042 --> 00:07:33,958
able to bypass and get sort of a
pseudodoe signature at least the
device (indiscernible) movement.

77
00:07:33,958 --> 00:07:35,958
And loading the actual
recompiled operating system.
Because every single phone

78
00:07:35,958 --> 00:07:39,208
vendor has their own operating
system. So I wrote my own, not
my own, it was a modified

79
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:42,833
version of grew. And I will go
into detail for that in a little
bit. So yeah once again, there's

80
00:07:42,833 --> 00:07:45,583
no application process sorries,
is anybody in the room looking
at getting into cell phone

81
00:07:45,583 --> 00:07:49,000
hacking? And don't? This is the
perfect phone for doing it. I
know you can buy these things in

82
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,958
bulk for $8 a piece. And the
(indiscernible) have [P][S][N]
numbers you cannot activate with

83
00:07:51,958 --> 00:07:56,708
regular service. But if you guys
wanted try them out, you can get
locked ones. That's a Verizon

84
00:07:56,708 --> 00:08:00,083
account or burner phone for
maybe about six months or a
year, you can pull them in the

85
00:08:00,083 --> 00:08:03,458
normal [line of service. It was
written in C++. We got any C++
guys in the house? Anybody

86
00:08:03,458 --> 00:08:06,250
program that? Okay, awesome.
That definitely, if you feel
right at home, so, and umm,

87
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:09,625
that's very like I said, it was
very, very easy. I have no
experience. I've root add couple

88
00:08:09,625 --> 00:08:13,542
phones, but it was always else's
tool and I was interested in. So
you guys will be able to pick up

89
00:08:13,542 --> 00:08:16,917
one of these phones and start
dabbling, it's amazing. I
thought it had to be in a table.

90
00:08:16,917 --> 00:08:20,458
Something to get that little gap
over or something like that. So
that's what it took. I think it

91
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:26,458
took like 15, 1620 people in a
whole community to break some of
the other phones out there. So

92
00:08:37,208 --> 00:08:43,208
that's what I'm saying. This is
an amazing phone if you want to
get into cell phone hacking. And

93
00:08:45,583 --> 00:08:51,583
there's actual features that are
built into it. When I saw it was
I ringer, I thought it was an

94
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:40,250
iPhone type deal. But it's
definitely not. It's an actual,
the way it boot it is actual

95
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:59,000
ringtones in the computer,
(indiscernible) the actual
phone. Sorry about that. I'm

96
00:10:10,292 --> 00:10:16,292
able to actually interact with
the (indiscernible) speaker. So
that's, it's the way they had

97
00:10:23,667 --> 00:10:28,167
them built. They had them built
for a lot of extra stuff for a
lot of expansion. And ways you

98
00:10:28,167 --> 00:10:34,167
can push  ‑ ‑ for example, if
you want to save your battery
time, you push to a screen that

99
00:10:37,833 --> 00:10:44,958
doesn't exist. And the screen
doesn't light up during calls.  
‑ ‑ justideling though, this

100
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:49,708
phone is amazingly FIFRNLT I've
literally left one set of my DEF
CON talks and speeches I was at

101
00:10:49,708 --> 00:10:53,208
before, and it's been going for
seven days and the battery still
has three bars. Very, very

102
00:10:53,208 --> 00:10:56,708
efficient phone. And it's  ‑ ‑
I'll show you some ways to
(indiscernible) to it. Where you

103
00:10:56,708 --> 00:11:00,833
can get it to go through an
entire five‑ day cycle. You buy
these phones for 12 to $14, and

104
00:11:00,833 --> 00:11:04,542
it comes with $10 prepared. And
$2 a day for unlimited calling.
That plan in itself is pretty

105
00:11:04,542 --> 00:11:07,417
amazing. Yup, and clam type
phones. Everybody familiar with
those. They have some features

106
00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:11,333
where they can tell if the clam
is open. And the developer, an
OE edition operators on it, the

107
00:11:11,333 --> 00:11:14,625
type one I [compiled, you're
able to bypass anything. Imagine
everything on that phone and you

108
00:11:14,625 --> 00:11:18,625
can for the most part interact
with it. When the phone is
actually closed, I did run into

109
00:11:18,625 --> 00:11:24,625
some problems, the ones that
have extra screens you can push
it into and things like that.

110
00:12:41,833 --> 00:12:47,792
Yeah, became a lot simpler. I
would go to sleep and be
thinking about it. Like

111
00:12:47,792 --> 00:12:54,083
ringtone. Because that's how the
actual payloads are developed.
You can develop your own, which

112
00:12:54,083 --> 00:13:00,083
are basically mall form ringtone
packets. It's not something they
would have to rewrite. There's a

113
00:13:02,083 --> 00:13:08,292
lot that you can interact with.
Mall form ringtone generator.
And you can actually load them

114
00:13:08,292 --> 00:13:16,000
in that way also, so. And here's
a modified executable was the
way that I actually loaded the

115
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:23,667
actual firmware into the phone.
And the certificate expired in I
think it was 2012. So a

116
00:13:23,667 --> 00:13:30,792
certificate from 2006 to 2012.
This phone's been out for quite
a few years. So yes, basically

117
00:13:30,792 --> 00:13:37,333
the expiration process is the
way I was able to load what
looked like would have been

118
00:13:37,333 --> 00:13:41,833
vendor sign specific. All I had
to do  ‑ ‑ it was a simple work
around, I can't go into too much

119
00:13:41,833 --> 00:13:47,875
detail I guess. I haven't heard
about from call come on it. So
this error is exploited by

120
00:13:47,875 --> 00:13:53,875
modify executable. It'll open up
a couple of the other
interfaces, the way I recompile

121
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:03,208
it had loader of the firmware,
with any valid certificate. So
quite literally  ‑ ‑   ‑ ‑ it

122
00:14:03,208 --> 00:14:08,958
was made to be easy. For you
know, quite literally anybody
can just. (Audio stopped.) Takes

123
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:14,667
about eight‑ minute, the first
time I've been loading the last
few ideas, they were right

124
00:14:14,667 --> 00:14:20,667
around that eight‑ minute range.
So. It allows for one second,
the entire full attack surface

125
00:14:23,833 --> 00:14:30,167
of the computer. So  ‑ ‑ or the
actual phone. So, and it's
amazing. You can enter, you can

126
00:14:30,167 --> 00:14:35,500
actually do a lot of the
bluetooth functionality that I'm
totally excited to have some

127
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:40,333
time again when I get home. I
thought of a couple things and
people have talked to me about

128
00:14:40,333 --> 00:14:47,542
some things that would be
really, really nice to have as a
payload on this phone. So yup as

129
00:14:47,542 --> 00:14:52,583
you can see, the driver device
information are now supported by
expired certificates. And that's

130
00:14:52,583 --> 00:14:57,500
the main reason (inaudible) by
pass. And that's what I'm saying
A community on the focal, keep

131
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:04,208
these types of things up and not
use. It was a value chip set.
From what I could see, a hard

132
00:15:04,208 --> 00:15:08,625
time to get people to develop
applications for it. That was
one of the reasons I was able to

133
00:15:08,625 --> 00:15:13,708
get quite literally any
information out there. You know,
I did sign up for a couple

134
00:15:13,708 --> 00:15:19,708
things here and there, but as
far as I was able to find most
of the stuff online. So. And as

135
00:15:22,042 --> 00:15:28,542
you can see, it expired in 2012.
And yeah. I did, like I said,
the work around was a modified.

136
00:15:28,542 --> 00:15:34,542
Executable and it was on the Sam
sung side. So it was very, very
out dated. And there was no bad

137
00:15:36,833 --> 00:15:41,042
on their part. I wouldn't  ‑ ‑
this phone is very, very  ‑ ‑
they don't make them a lot of

138
00:15:41,042 --> 00:15:46,542
money off of them. So I would
understand from their aspects
so. But umm, yeah, with a simple

139
00:15:46,542 --> 00:15:52,542
host files work around with
custom filed executable. So. You
can quite literally modify

140
00:15:55,875 --> 00:16:01,750
everything on machine level with
some of the drivers and just the
way it was blocked. It was

141
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:06,708
extremely simple. I couldn't
believe how simple it was
actually for, I'm not much for

142
00:16:06,708 --> 00:16:11,458
cell phone acting. I've never
been part of any communities and
I developed a couple apps here

143
00:16:11,458 --> 00:16:18,667
and there. But it was very, very
minute back in the day. And
here's one of the favorite parts

144
00:16:18,667 --> 00:16:24,500
of the phone. One of the feature
sets (indiscernible) roaming.
And basically what it'll do is

145
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:30,500
pull down (indiscernible)
towers. So you guys we'll
triangulate your your house. You

146
00:16:34,708 --> 00:16:41,458
can lock it and do a random
stand off on three of the tours.
So for the most part, it would

147
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:45,292
be impossible to triANG late
depending on how randomly
(indiscernible). That's also the

148
00:16:45,292 --> 00:16:51,333
vulnerabilities where it's able
to  ‑ ‑ the way it was able to
interact with the towers, I was

149
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:56,542
able to make 70 calls a minute.
So there's no no reason at all
why it should be able to make 70

150
00:16:56,542 --> 00:17:02,542
call AS minute. That's another
thing, the GPS functionality was
very easy to turn off. I found

151
00:17:04,875 --> 00:17:12,833
out it doesn't turn on fully
until you make a 911 emergency
call. It looks like some kind of

152
00:17:12,833 --> 00:17:17,500
interaction with towers on
regular basis. But the GPS
information I was getting was

153
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:23,500
very far off. So, as you can
develop applications for the
attack platform by

154
00:17:26,042 --> 00:17:31,083
(indiscernible) software written
on the phone. You can try it
out. I've wrecked several of

155
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:38,333
these devices. And one OFLT
actual ways I wrote one of my
ringtone packet's was, one of

156
00:17:38,333 --> 00:17:42,000
them was, that would be cool to
be able to break the phone. By
putting the ringtone in there.

157
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:47,958
And I'll go over that one in a
bit so. But I'm saying, you can
try them out, (indiscernible) 65

158
00:17:47,958 --> 00:17:55,583
them. And yeah. It's pretty
amazing to be able to play with
them before you get them loaded

159
00:17:55,583 --> 00:18:03,542
on the actual system. Okay, so
now you have an unlocked
platform. What now? And umm,

160
00:18:03,542 --> 00:18:08,792
that's what I'm saying, the
attack platform is full control
of the devices on the phones.

161
00:18:08,792 --> 00:18:14,708
And this is some of the payloads
that I actually did. The call
bombs was obviously one of them.

162
00:18:14,708 --> 00:18:20,125
Some of them are default ring
tones left in there. I sent my
number on a number of another

163
00:18:20,125 --> 00:18:26,583
phone that I want to actually
have, do the  ‑ ‑ it'll call
whatever number in the text

164
00:18:26,583 --> 00:18:32,583
message 70 time AS minute until
the battery dies in the phone.
That's an extreme amount of

165
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:45,708
calls in a short amount of time
and practically untraceable. And
the other one was if I ended the

166
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:50,958
five‑ day cycle, I set an alarm.
So it'll actually break the
phone. And if somebody was a

167
00:18:50,958 --> 00:18:54,250
little bit better and had a
little bit more time in
programming stuff like that, it

168
00:18:54,250 --> 00:19:00,750
would probably turn off the
flash types scenarios on the
phone. So there'd be ways to

169
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:06,708
make it unrecoverable. So you do
have full access to the actual
phone and all the devices and

170
00:19:06,708 --> 00:19:12,708
interfaces on the phone.
Everybody know what a cheese box
is? Cheese box is what bookies

171
00:19:17,917 --> 00:19:23,917
used to use. Where people would
call in and would anonymousize
their phone number on the back.

172
00:19:29,625 --> 00:19:34,625
It wrote a ringtone packet which
helped me to deliver the ring
tones. They bluetooth to one

173
00:19:34,625 --> 00:19:41,875
another. And able to pass the
phone call through. So I call in
one number or have friends call

174
00:19:41,875 --> 00:19:48,667
in one number, and after a
random am amount of time, you
could put 155  seconds on  ‑ ‑  

175
00:19:48,667 --> 00:19:54,333
‑ ‑ be on different towers. You
could have two phones but be on
separate towers. So it would

176
00:19:54,333 --> 00:19:59,583
make it entirely anonymous. I
know there are services that do
form forwarding and proxying.

177
00:19:59,583 --> 00:20:04,417
And things like that. But this
would be something you could set
it up in 1520  minutes at your

178
00:20:04,417 --> 00:20:10,417
house. I could think of many
reasons  ‑ ‑ this is one of the
ones that. (Audio stopped.) And

179
00:20:12,833 --> 00:20:19,792
maybe back in the day they used
it for, I'm sure people would
have other reasons for doing it.

180
00:20:19,792 --> 00:20:27,208
But there's other reasons
(indiscernible) iPhone numbers
and things like that. So this

181
00:20:27,208 --> 00:20:31,500
goes to show here, you can
connect up to three devices so
you could have random call out

182
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:37,292
numbers even. And basically I
was trying to do a commanding
control thing with an actual

183
00:20:37,292 --> 00:20:45,208
smart phone. I didn't have time
to complete it. And let's see.
Call time is passed. Okay. And

184
00:20:45,208 --> 00:20:51,208
that's basically, like I said,
an untraceable proxy. Yup, this
is another one that I think a

185
00:20:55,125 --> 00:20:59,750
lot of people would have
interest with, a lot of people
are familiar with war demand

186
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:03,875
back in the day where they would
be able to find modem numbers.
This one's basically for finding

187
00:21:03,875 --> 00:21:09,875
voice mailboxes. You can turn
the U 365 platform into an
actual crawling platform where

188
00:21:12,292 --> 00:21:16,875
you could go through entire
phone (indiscernible). Or do
actual voice mailboxes and

189
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:23,458
businesses. And it'll
(indiscernible) [P]C. It'll
pull  ‑ ‑ it'll pull twice so it

190
00:21:23,458 --> 00:21:28,333
get AS voice mail. And then on
the third one, it'll actually
record the voice mail with an

191
00:21:28,333 --> 00:21:33,917
actual program I wrote for my
computer. And the on the next
page you'll see, you can  ‑ ‑ it

192
00:21:33,917 --> 00:21:41,208
comes up to 900 ringtones, or
900 of the actual numbers that
you called. So you can put

193
00:21:41,208 --> 00:21:47,292
ranges in. The portion of the
script on the bottom is for that
one, stuff installed wrong, I

194
00:21:47,292 --> 00:21:51,750
apologize for that. It was just
comment stuff. I know the
original version looked like an

195
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:57,167
Nigerian e‑ mail F. You guys
look on your disks, if you
wanted a updated slide

196
00:21:57,167 --> 00:22:00,375
presentation, feel free to e‑
mail me. And basically, the
program that I added two things,

197
00:22:00,375 --> 00:22:04,083
it would horde MP3 to crawl
mailboxes anonymously. And the
second one is for actually

198
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:18,542
programming the phone I attached
to five of these to my computer
at once. And just hit the go

199
00:22:18,542 --> 00:22:22,583
button. And it gave me
California prefaxed phone
numbersment once in a while,

200
00:22:22,583 --> 00:22:24,583
this kind of thing would be
easily mitigated by people
actually changing the options

201
00:22:24,583 --> 00:22:30,583
once in a while not just so
people can just SPAM through
them. So. Yup, and umm, here's

202
00:22:35,708 --> 00:22:43,208
the prepaid cell phone and in
its glory. I just love it when I
have a cellular USB attached to

203
00:22:43,208 --> 00:22:49,208
it. There's actually low energy
mode where I can (indiscernible)
have the thing calling. A little

204
00:22:49,208 --> 00:22:57,000
over 30 calls a minute. Stably
with a USB charger. And just
toss it into a lamp fixture.

205
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:04,167
Anyway, that's like a public
facility. It stayed stably
charged  ‑ ‑ I tried it out with

206
00:23:04,167 --> 00:23:08,750
the, what was it? A 60 or
something like that. And it went
about a day and a half still. I

207
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:15,708
was very impressed. That USB
cellular charger was $6. I
didn't know they've gotten it

208
00:23:15,708 --> 00:23:23,208
cheeper. I would have bought it
a lot earlier. With these phone,
with the way I write my ringtone

209
00:23:23,208 --> 00:23:28,250
packets, there's a couple
options like you compile them or
do really energy efficient. And

210
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:34,000
you could do so much time
basically where you could just
pseudoturn the phone off. That

211
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:40,000
was another ringtone packets
that that I generated. And like
I said, these are anonymous

212
00:23:42,375 --> 00:23:45,708
purchases I bought. They
wouldn't let me buy more than
two of them per day for some

213
00:23:45,708 --> 00:23:52,250
reason. (Laughing) I don't know
if they called and that was
(indiscernible) fulfilled

214
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:57,958
(inaudible). So. They wouldn't
let me buy more than two of them
a day. They're basically

215
00:23:57,958 --> 00:24:04,417
untraceable  ‑ ‑ I just love the
idea of the pure REL
(inaudible). When I perfected it

216
00:24:04,417 --> 00:24:10,792
finally, pulling it down and
actuallying jumping through
random towers, it was, I don't

217
00:24:10,792 --> 00:24:15,000
know, it's a very good  ‑ ‑ it
would be nice for even something
like this or you could do tower

218
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:21,000
locking. I showed up  ‑ ‑ I've
been in L LASHGS since the
first. I've DN  ‑ ‑ there's son

219
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:30,000
of (indiscernible) cells and
fake cell towers in the hotels.
This is one of the only

220
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:35,292
conferences I would expect
(indiscernible) deal of that
kind of stuff. Total investment

221
00:24:35,292 --> 00:24:41,292
for a five die DDOS. ‑ ‑   ‑ ‑
unget grandfathered D[S][N].
(Indiscernible) 65 still

222
00:24:53,458 --> 00:24:57,792
(inaudible) pulse. The $2 a day
plan. These things are cheep. It
has a newer version of brew,

223
00:24:57,792 --> 00:25:03,792
it's 1.151. Which is pretty
close to the same, it has an
updated certificate. This would

224
00:25:10,667 --> 00:25:16,667
have to be other methods found.
This is an amazing hand set to
be able to play with if you're

225
00:25:19,458 --> 00:25:24,375
getting into cell phone hacking.
And the phone being turned
(indiscernible) monitor. And

226
00:25:24,375 --> 00:25:31,458
like I said, the firmware push,
it's just using a special U[S]B
cable. You don't need to crack

227
00:25:31,458 --> 00:25:37,708
it open and do a bunch of other
stuff do it. It's quite
literally where anybody can

228
00:25:37,708 --> 00:25:43,792
practically do it. So, that's
when it becomes scary. You know,
it's one thing like, how many

229
00:25:43,792 --> 00:25:51,500
people in here if they wanted to
could hijack [P]RRI lines and
ZIP code? Yeah. That's what I'm

230
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:58,250
saying. How many people in here
can go spend $12 at their
favorite box stores? There would

231
00:25:58,250 --> 00:26:02,500
be a larger majority I would
imagine. And that's when stuff
gets scary. That's why I want to

232
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:09,417
bring this to people's
attention. I know there's like
advanced methods out there.

233
00:26:09,417 --> 00:26:16,375
They're not that advanced once
you understand and experience
with those systems. But, it's

234
00:26:16,375 --> 00:26:21,750
just something I would not like
to have with some of the DDOS
methods. It's something where,

235
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:25,250
it brings it a little more real
world, a little more personal.
It's one thing when your web

236
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:30,958
page dose down, but another when
your coal manager gets locked up
on a situation. It's just on a

237
00:26:30,958 --> 00:26:35,875
different level. It's something
where  ‑ ‑ I've worked on
mitigation method where is

238
00:26:35,875 --> 00:26:40,667
there's a plug in for pall
manager and pall manager
express. Where it'll have a cap

239
00:26:40,667 --> 00:26:46,958
show up on the actual DWAS and
system, and you know, their time
a caller ID information that's

240
00:26:46,958 --> 00:26:51,542
plugged in, it'll send a
challenge. So it's something
that people will be able to load

241
00:26:51,542 --> 00:26:57,875
into the actual pole manager
software. And another one is an
an DRAD app. Like third time

242
00:26:57,875 --> 00:27:02,458
challenges. Something I know
eventually will be used in the
wild more. Yeah, it's near that

243
00:27:02,458 --> 00:27:08,458
kind of stuff. It's something
that a lot of people, I think a
lot of people aren't focussing

244
00:27:14,125 --> 00:27:17,667
on it as much as they should be.
I've been seeing how much it's
used in some of the bank

245
00:27:17,667 --> 00:27:23,667
(indiscernible)s and stuff so.
So I was going to do a full
blown demonstration of the TDOS,

246
00:27:27,125 --> 00:27:31,458
but there's something really
weird about the cell phone
towers that I was picking up in

247
00:27:31,458 --> 00:27:37,250
the hotel. (Laughing) so umm,
that is the reason that I could
not do my demonstrations to the

248
00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:45,083
fullest extent. And umm, yeah.
It was amazing 'cause as I was
actually booting it up, two of

249
00:27:45,083 --> 00:27:51,333
my phones didn't kick on to the
actual tower. So as you can see
at the beginning here, I had two

250
00:27:51,333 --> 00:27:58,583
phones kicked on, and it peeked
it up and  ‑ ‑ it'd be running
for probably about five, 15 

251
00:27:58,583 --> 00:28:04,167
minutes something like that. And
then I had a little bit of peaks
when I went from the four phone.

252
00:28:04,167 --> 00:28:11,000
When I went from the eight phone
to the ten phone, it locked the
BM one. It wasn't one gig

253
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:17,000
running some older operating
system. This thing was beefy. I
think it was eight and change.

254
00:28:19,375 --> 00:28:26,167
For a life calling operating
system, that is amazingly grade
actually. But you put it  ‑ ‑

255
00:28:26,167 --> 00:28:31,292
could have been an actual, like,
think of the scenarios where you
could actually crash a call

256
00:28:31,292 --> 00:28:37,292
center. Some of the biggest ones
I think about is blocking a 911
emergency system. I could quite

257
00:28:37,292 --> 00:28:43,292
lit literally, I wouldn't do the
call 911. The one that's a 911
basically translated into, and

258
00:28:46,542 --> 00:28:51,042
it could literally take down, I
live in a smaller state, there's
600 something thousand people.

259
00:28:51,042 --> 00:28:56,708
It's growing a little bit with
the oil boom, but it literally
could take down 15 of these

260
00:28:56,708 --> 00:29:04,042
phones. That's scary. That could
deny service  ‑ ‑ if used in
conjunction with other federal

261
00:29:04,042 --> 00:29:08,083
agencies would be entirely
wrapped up. They'd be looking
for hints. If it was used in

262
00:29:08,083 --> 00:29:12,792
conjunction with some sort of
terrorist attack, it would be
unimaginable. And that's what

263
00:29:12,792 --> 00:29:18,917
I'm saying  ‑ ‑ as far as skill
set goes, if somebody was to
release this kind of

264
00:29:18,917 --> 00:29:23,333
(indiscernible) tool to the
wild, it would be  ‑ ‑ like
somebody could get fired from a

265
00:29:23,333 --> 00:29:30,417
pizza delivery place and for an
hour later deny service for ten
days for $10. That is just.

266
00:29:30,417 --> 00:29:35,458
(Audio stopped.) Crazy. And
yeah, pretty much any
organization, a person is

267
00:29:35,458 --> 00:29:41,458
disliked, it's just, stores
during holiday seasons. There's
lots of IRS around tax system.

268
00:29:43,917 --> 00:29:47,792
That would actually do financial
damage to the actual
infrastructure of the United

269
00:29:47,792 --> 00:29:54,250
States. And it's amazing how
like a cheep, a little good
phone, cheep phones, but

270
00:29:54,250 --> 00:30:00,417
(indiscernible) over the last
few months and. I'm sad to see
it go. Because they literally

271
00:30:00,417 --> 00:30:06,417
came out with the gusto free
where they (indiscernible) into
the mainstream. And I'm going to

272
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:12,667
open it up to questions a little
bit. And I'm going to do some
talking if you don't like

273
00:30:12,667 --> 00:30:20,500
questions. I always like to give
thanks to my wife and family and
big guy for giving me computer

274
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:25,708
(inaudible). And Tim for final
(indiscernible)s and spellings.
But I'd like to open it up for

275
00:30:25,708 --> 00:30:29,125
questions if anybody has
questions. Do you have any
mitigation (inaudible)

276
00:30:29,125 --> 00:30:34,583
perspective. >>	Yup, I have an
actual  ‑ ‑   ‑ ‑ call manager.
SPS (indiscernible) specific

277
00:30:34,583 --> 00:30:40,333
right now. But that's just the
world I came from. But it
actually has, the third time it

278
00:30:40,333 --> 00:30:46,125
come calls in, it has its own
(indiscernible) phone. Where it
picks up and challenges you with

279
00:30:46,125 --> 00:30:52,125
the cap cha. There's 15 cap chas
I developed at this point. Does
that answer your question?

280
00:31:00,917 --> 00:31:06,917
>>	Yes thanks. >>	We should
talk. >>	Awesome. >>	I actually
spoke yesterday in sky talks on

281
00:31:11,042 --> 00:31:14,958
common  ‑ ‑   ‑ ‑ I guess the
only TDOS scenario you didn't
cover, which by the way your

282
00:31:14,958 --> 00:31:19,333
coverage of how they're
generating this was excellent. I
saw a couple I hadn't seen

283
00:31:19,333 --> 00:31:22,708
before. But the one scheme
that's used is actually
extortion. So they'll get

284
00:31:22,708 --> 00:31:28,708
somebody's information, you
know, usually like loan that
they're behind on or maybe some

285
00:31:41,125 --> 00:31:45,458
sort of criminal history and
call them at work and say hay,
you got to pay us 50 bucks or

286
00:31:45,458 --> 00:31:51,708
we're going to let your employer
know. And they will just, you
know, say the best thing we can

287
00:31:51,708 --> 00:31:58,917
do is take down your place of
work. >>	Yup. Exactly. Yeah.
I'll be out in the chain smoking

288
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:04,417
area after this talk. So.
Anybody else have any other
questions? Quite literally any

289
00:32:04,417 --> 00:32:09,792
question questions. >>	Sure,
have you looked into any of the
newer smart phones

290
00:32:09,792 --> 00:32:14,958
(indiscernible) phones? >>	
(Audio stopped.) The reason I
went for this platform because

291
00:32:14,958 --> 00:32:20,958
of this deep dollars. I have no
problem leaving ten of them in a
library charging. That's scary

292
00:32:24,292 --> 00:32:30,625
with the platform. Even if it
was my older android phone, I
finally got my two‑ year

293
00:32:30,625 --> 00:32:35,708
(indiscernible) phone or
whatever. I would feel bad
leaving one of those devices in

294
00:32:35,708 --> 00:32:41,750
places where so much information
is kept. That's why I did it on
the smaller platform. It's

295
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:47,292
literally a burner phone. It is
very, very DIZ posable that's
what I love about it. It's

296
00:32:47,292 --> 00:32:53,292
energy efficient. 15  days idle.
That's with the actual  ‑ ‑ if
it wasn't doing phone DO[S].

297
00:32:56,250 --> 00:33:02,250
That answer your question. >>	I
was actually thinking about
looking at the newer ones. The

298
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:12,417
smart phones. >>	That would be
very, very awesome. Rooted
phones are pretty hard core out

299
00:33:12,417 --> 00:33:17,708
there. Pretty much it's
understand lying on some of the
operating systems is a basic

300
00:33:17,708 --> 00:33:25,667
LINUX description. That would be
amazing to see what that could
grow into. So thank you. >>	Have

301
00:33:25,667 --> 00:33:31,042
you tried connecting the towers
on on and off as fast as
possible? >>	I have actually.

302
00:33:31,042 --> 00:33:36,792
That's one of the ways when I do
a couple [T]RL[S]s,
(indiscernible) roaming. I

303
00:33:36,792 --> 00:33:42,792
haven't lost the 12  hours
OERSZ  ‑ ‑ (inaudible) phone up
when I do the full 15 for some

304
00:33:45,167 --> 00:33:49,625
reason. I've tried connecting
and disconnecting to powers and
pulling off of other towers and

305
00:33:49,625 --> 00:33:57,083
hopping mid tower. So. Does that
answer your question? >>	I was
just wondering if you melted a

306
00:33:57,083 --> 00:34:02,292
cell phone tower (inaudible).
>>	If I melted? What do you
mean? >>	Well like

307
00:34:02,292 --> 00:34:07,917
(indiscernible) idle active or
negotiate with the tower
(inaudible) disconnect. >>	It

308
00:34:07,917 --> 00:34:12,458
takes a little bit long
especially on these devices to
do something to the tower that

309
00:34:12,458 --> 00:34:19,500
would be harmful. But that would
be awesome. But yeah, you guy KS
get one of these phones.

310
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:25,500
>>	(Inaudible) use more phones.
>>	 (Laughing) . >>	Mine's
actually (inaudible) kind of

311
00:34:28,208 --> 00:34:33,792
(inaudible). Why is there
nothing in the background? SDP
why is Verizon hay not 70 calls

312
00:34:33,792 --> 00:34:37,167
in two minutes what the hell?
>>	I would love to talk to
Verizon about that. Because it

313
00:34:37,167 --> 00:34:44,042
was lopping towers and
(inaudible) actually I know for
the most part the towers aren't

314
00:34:44,042 --> 00:34:49,208
talking to each other. Or
they're not talking the way they
should. Is what I mean. >>	Is

315
00:34:49,208 --> 00:34:54,417
there something like can Verizon
eventually audit why are we
seeing 10,000  percent more

316
00:34:54,417 --> 00:34:58,833
calls on these four towers.
>>	That's the exact reason I did
this. To get it out there, that

317
00:34:58,833 --> 00:35:03,167
could of stuff shouldn't be
possible. Especially  ‑ ‑   ‑ ‑
even if they want to designate

318
00:35:03,167 --> 00:35:06,750
burner phones, this phone in
general, there's no legitimate
reason for it. And that's what

319
00:35:06,750 --> 00:35:10,833
I'm saying we're  ‑ ‑ that's
kind of the point I wanted to
bring it out. There are things,

320
00:35:10,833 --> 00:35:16,833
there are very easy ways we can
begin with. They could limit the
amount of calls with the burner

321
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:27,958
phones. >>	(Inaudible) they do
none of that. >>	Yeah. I have  ‑
‑ >>	I am so surprised.

322
00:35:27,958 --> 00:35:32,917
(Laughing) . >>	Yeah no, they're
doing a good job of other
things, but it seems like

323
00:35:32,917 --> 00:35:38,208
something  ‑ ‑ I would like to
see what they would be able to
do with it. So yeah. Does that

324
00:35:38,208 --> 00:35:42,208
answer your question? >>	Yeah.
Really well. Thanks. >>	Does
anybody have any questions?

325
00:35:44,458 --> 00:35:50,458
Quite literally no dumb
questions. So. There's a
gentleman in the back here.

326
00:35:54,917 --> 00:36:00,375
>>	Have you tried this with text
message? >>	Yes I actually did
fully unlock the [S]M[S]

327
00:36:00,375 --> 00:36:05,750
functionality. I didn't do any
text bombing because I think
there's [S]M[S] service is easy

328
00:36:05,750 --> 00:36:11,792
to do it with. But this would be
entirely anonymous. It's a very
cheep [S]M[S] gait way if you

329
00:36:11,792 --> 00:36:17,750
want to hack into a computer and
send text messages for any
reason. This thing is not only

330
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:23,708
an attack platform, but quite
anything you want to do on a
phone. A couple of these you can

331
00:36:23,708 --> 00:36:28,625
do load balancing. And pretty
interesting. I would love to see
what the community could do with

332
00:36:28,625 --> 00:36:31,500
it. Does that answer your
question? >>	Absolutely.
>>	Awesome. What was your

333
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:37,500
question sir. >>	Have you looked
at whether or not this can deal
with a tower? >>	Yeah that

334
00:36:40,583 --> 00:36:45,333
that's kind of what my next step
was. But I don't know a good
legal way I could do it without

335
00:36:45,333 --> 00:36:51,333
(inaudible) issues. (Inaudible).
The company I do work for for a
an engineering (inaudible).

336
00:36:54,292 --> 00:36:59,875
Actual stuff. I would like to
disclaim on that also, this was
done all on my free time. My

337
00:36:59,875 --> 00:37:05,875
work had nothing to do with it.
Aside from, you know, having I
guess a job. What's your

338
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:18,167
question ma'am? >>	So it seems
more, I don't know useful, I
guess, to tacking a call center.

339
00:37:18,167 --> 00:37:26,042
But I'm just curious like did
you weaponize this against your
home phone line or your cell?

340
00:37:26,042 --> 00:37:31,750
Just to like  ‑ ‑ what does it
look like from the receiving
end? Did would I get 70 empty

341
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:36,958
voice mails from you or what
would happen? >>	About the
seventh or eighth call, the your

342
00:37:36,958 --> 00:37:44,292
phone would deauthenticate from
the tower. And literally, you
would pretty much get calls for

343
00:37:44,292 --> 00:37:50,292
the next quite literally until
the battery died in the other
phone. I'm positive (inaudible).

344
00:37:52,375 --> 00:37:57,083
It just rings. It quite
literally just rings. And then
it has a computer behind it. A

345
00:37:57,083 --> 00:38:02,292
lot of it is getting through the
actual cell. I didn't go to the
point where I would block

346
00:38:02,292 --> 00:38:08,000
anything up. I wanted to keep
this legal. Because I do have a
job to keep and stuff. That's a

347
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:15,250
good idea. Like I was say, the
cell phone was the one that
through me off and sometimes

348
00:38:15,250 --> 00:38:23,125
when it was (indiscernible) in
towers, it would quit sending
calling ID info. I would love to

349
00:38:23,125 --> 00:38:29,125
dive into it because  ‑ ‑   ‑ ‑
does that answer your question?
Thank you. >>	I have a question,

350
00:38:33,417 --> 00:38:40,750
how is anonymity achieved?
Purchasing on Ebay or walking
into a store. >>	Anonymity on my

351
00:38:40,750 --> 00:38:47,417
part? I have literally bought
most of them. The ones I was
tinkering with, I didn't pay a

352
00:38:47,417 --> 00:38:53,500
homeless man. I'm not that
paranoid. I didn't pay cash for
them, but I didn't  ‑ ‑

353
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:59,042
(inaudible). No, I just wanted
pick them up. I don't know why
they do a two (inaudible). One

354
00:38:59,042 --> 00:39:03,792
of my HOER research materials I
came up with. >>	(Inaudible)
walking into Wal‑ Mart and

355
00:39:03,792 --> 00:39:09,792
purchasing phones (inaudible).
>>	Yup. They have a couple, a
bit of the information outside

356
00:39:09,792 --> 00:39:14,083
(inaudible). So you could, they
could tell what Wal‑ Mart it was
bought at. That's what I'm

357
00:39:14,083 --> 00:39:20,083
saying, I'm sure there'll be a
web page (indiscernible) buy
(inaudible) does that answer

358
00:39:20,083 --> 00:39:26,083
your question? Yup. Okay. What's
your question? >>	You mentioned
a little bit about the

359
00:39:29,292 --> 00:39:35,292
inaccuracy of GPS. How
inaccurate was it? >>	I think it
was 6070  feet from the actual 

360
00:39:38,375 --> 00:39:42,708
‑ ‑ unless my phone was off too,
but it looked like it was quite
literally pretty  ‑ ‑ (Audio

361
00:39:42,708 --> 00:39:47,875
stopped.) You would have been
able to tell the building
someone called 911 from or where

362
00:39:47,875 --> 00:39:53,125
their truck went in the river or
whatever that situation. But
(inaudible) lock. You can change

363
00:39:53,125 --> 00:39:59,750
the functionality of, I think it
was a star 228 function. There's
another star functioning and you

364
00:39:59,750 --> 00:40:04,708
could adapt to them. They have a
like a little bit more
interaction with the system than

365
00:40:04,708 --> 00:40:10,750
the actual deviced did. That's
what Amy sighing, you could
reactually plug in, you know,

366
00:40:10,750 --> 00:40:18,125
your actual  ‑ ‑ you could lock
in a location to the exact same
GPS. As long as it's within the

367
00:40:18,125 --> 00:40:23,750
URL. I did find some  ‑ ‑ I
tried to spoof Montana or
everything like that where I

368
00:40:23,750 --> 00:40:26,792
went pretty far away. There were
some towers I couldn't
authenticate to. Does that

369
00:40:26,792 --> 00:40:32,792
answer your question? >>	Sure.
>>	Sure. >>	Could you DOS a net
work (inaudible). >>	You're

370
00:40:35,375 --> 00:40:41,375
talking within (indiscernible)
cell DOS a net work? >>	Yeah.
>>	I guess in what way would it

371
00:40:46,042 --> 00:40:51,042
be generating traffic. >>	Yeah.
>>	On the (indiscernible) cell.
Yeah, you could white list it

372
00:40:51,042 --> 00:40:55,167
out with the phones. You could
have 50 phones and nobody else
would be able to talk to

373
00:40:55,167 --> 00:41:01,917
(indiscernible) cell. You could
do it with 25 phones actuallies.
I think it handles fender cells

374
00:41:01,917 --> 00:41:05,250
a little bit different, that's
why I couldn't do the
demonstration of it crashing.

375
00:41:05,250 --> 00:41:11,250
(Indiscernible) [P][S]A
(indiscernible). The 23 times
five. Over 200 phone numbers. So

376
00:41:13,667 --> 00:41:18,917
yeah. Definitely. Does that
answer your question? >>	Yeah.
>>	Does anybody else have any

377
00:41:18,917 --> 00:41:24,917
other questions? Sweet. Awesome.
I have  ‑ ‑ I hope I'm doing
good on time. I want to thank

378
00:41:27,625 --> 00:41:33,625
you you guys for coming to see
me speak. I don't want this
gentleman to kick me off stage

379
00:41:39,042 --> 00:41:41,042
so. (Applause.)
