1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
>>This is KAREN. I'm still a
little tired. So without further
adieu we'll get into the talk.

2
00:00:16,083 --> 00:00:22,125
>>	Hopefully you can hear me
okay like this. How are you guys
doing? Having a good DEF CON?

3
00:00:22,125 --> 00:00:27,917
Welcome to Sunday afternoon|
track one, also known as the
after party track seeing that

4
00:00:27,917 --> 00:00:33,417
everybody has had a pretty wild
weekend. I guess you guys might
be hung over. But let me ask

5
00:00:33,417 --> 00:00:38,500
you, how many of you are here at
DEF CON for the first time? That
is a lot of you guys. Give

6
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:45,917
yourself a hand. You made it.
You are no longer DEF CON
virgins. All right! And the

7
00:00:45,917 --> 00:00:50,375
reason I bring that up is
because this is actually my
first time speaking at DEF CON.

8
00:00:50,375 --> 00:00:56,333
And I am extremely excited and a
little bit nervous to be to be
honest, to be with you here. But

9
00:00:56,333 --> 00:01:03,667
the reason I'm here is because I
honestly deeply and firmly
believe that hackers can have a

10
00:01:03,667 --> 00:01:09,708
positive impact on the world. We
can actually save the world for
generations to come. Now, I know

11
00:01:09,708 --> 00:01:13,875
that sounds like a tall order,
but I'm going to take you
through it SXISHGS hope by the

12
00:01:13,875 --> 00:01:20,417
end, we'll make true BLOOEFRNs
out of you. My name is KEVIN....
For those of you who find it

13
00:01:20,417 --> 00:01:26,417
difficult, you can find me
online as Karen E. Or also known
as special K in certain circles.

14
00:01:33,208 --> 00:01:37,958
So let's get the show on the
road. A little bit about myself,
I've been in the security

15
00:01:37,958 --> 00:01:43,833
industry for almost 15  years
now. I've worked with a bunch of
fortune 500 companies,

16
00:01:43,833 --> 00:01:50,208
consulting firms, government
agencies, think tanks, academic
organizations. All across the

17
00:01:50,208 --> 00:01:56,208
board. Security operation,
product management, intelligent
work, but that's not why I'm

18
00:01:58,292 --> 00:02:03,708
here today. I'm also on the
advisory board of a pretty cool
crypto currency (indiscernible)

19
00:02:03,708 --> 00:02:10,208
five. For those of you know
crypto no, ma'am son. Yes the
company is named after the one

20
00:02:10,208 --> 00:02:18,167
in the book. Thank you. But
again, that's not why I'm here
today. Actually, this woman is

21
00:02:18,167 --> 00:02:24,167
the reason I'm here today. So
that is Angelina Jolie right?
She portrayed acid burn in the

22
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:33,500
95 film hackers. I was 14 at
that time. And I can see you
doing the math trying to figure

23
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:39,208
out my age. I'm 33 now. So, I'm
going to save you the trouble.
It's Sunday. When I saw this

24
00:02:39,208 --> 00:02:45,208
movie, I instantly realized that
all this stuff that I like doing
was actually called being a

25
00:02:49,167 --> 00:02:55,167
hacker. And it's a thing. And
girls can do it too. And hackers
can be heros if they want to, so

26
00:02:57,917 --> 00:03:04,958
that is why I'm here. Now I have
another confession to make. Like
I told you, this is my first

27
00:03:04,958 --> 00:03:09,625
time speaking in DEF CON. I've
always wanted to speak here and
I've actually been submitting

28
00:03:09,625 --> 00:03:16,625
talks for years and I could
never get in. So then last year,
something exceptional happened

29
00:03:16,625 --> 00:03:23,083
to me. I was invited to speak at
the little place call Ted's.
Those of you who are not

30
00:03:23,083 --> 00:03:28,542
familiar with the concept, it's
a pretty high profile media
conference where they also film

31
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:35,750
the talk and put them online and
then millions of people watch
them. Naturally I freaked out. I

32
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:40,875
was also certain that I might
get hacked for giving a talk
about hackers. But then

33
00:03:40,875 --> 00:03:47,250
thankfully, I learned that ran
dell from (indiscernible) was
also going to be there. I so I

34
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:51,292
was relieved. I thought
everybody was going to pay
attention to his comments and

35
00:03:51,292 --> 00:03:57,292
cool stuff and not notice me. I
also realized it was a once in a
lifetime opportunity to use the

36
00:03:59,625 --> 00:04:05,500
(indiscernible) platform to hack
into people's minds. To get them
to change the way they see

37
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:10,292
hackers. The way they think
about us, about this community
that I've been a part of that I

38
00:04:10,292 --> 00:04:16,292
believe can do positive things.
So in order to make that change
happen, I created a virus. A

39
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:24,542
mental virus. An idea that would
stick with people as they
watched the talk and hopefully

40
00:04:24,542 --> 00:04:31,500
would propagate and spread on
ward. And that ideal was hackers
are a vital part of the world.

41
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:37,500
That we are actually kind of
like the immune system for the
information age. And that it

42
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:45,333
falls to us to find the
vulnerabilities and force the
world to fix them. Now I didn't

43
00:04:45,333 --> 00:04:50,042
know how well this message might
come across and I am humbled and
overwhelmed and excited  ‑ ‑ I

44
00:04:50,042 --> 00:04:56,042
think the virus worked. Because
almost 800,000 people watched it
shared it. And so apparently,

45
00:04:59,625 --> 00:05:06,458
outside of this conference,
outside of this community, there
is a willing audience ready to

46
00:05:06,458 --> 00:05:12,542
start looking at hackers
differently. Expecting us to
start being those heros. And so

47
00:05:12,542 --> 00:05:18,042
it's time for me to be here and
come full circle with you guys
and tell you about how we can be

48
00:05:18,042 --> 00:05:25,125
those heros and how we can make
that change happen. Now I'm not
a futurist, but I can offer one

49
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:32,458
prediction with regards to the
technology of future and cyber
space. We don't know what's

50
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:38,500
coming around the corner.
Technology's changing so fast.
But if we leave our digital

51
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:44,042
future, our civilian and
government infrastructure, if we
leave all of the technologies we

52
00:05:44,042 --> 00:05:51,125
rely on solely in the hands of
governments and multinational
corporates, guess what guys,

53
00:05:51,125 --> 00:05:57,667
they will mess it up. Now we can
argue about the degree and
measure of failure that is going

54
00:05:57,667 --> 00:06:03,000
to happen. But based on past
experience, there is no reason
to expect things to be

55
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:09,625
different, especially with the
way certain governments are
looking at cyber space. So I

56
00:06:09,625 --> 00:06:16,583
think now is the time, now is
the transformative time in
history of technology and it's

57
00:06:16,583 --> 00:06:24,083
the time for hackers to start
making that kind of impact. But
in order to make that happen, we

58
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:30,375
have to make a choice. We have
to decide that we are willing to
be part of the solution and not

59
00:06:30,375 --> 00:06:36,792
part of the problem. So today,
in order to make it easy for you
to make the choice, I'm going to

60
00:06:36,792 --> 00:06:44,250
walk you through some of what I
think are the biggest thorniest,
hairiest problems and why I

61
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:50,833
think it does fall to hackers to
fix these and we can't leave it
in the hands of government. Now

62
00:06:50,833 --> 00:06:56,792
let's start with what is perhaps
the chunkiest problem of them
all. That is the cyber problem.

63
00:06:56,792 --> 00:07:02,917
I know cyber's been, they lose
it to a drinking game. And I
will happily have a drink later,

64
00:07:02,917 --> 00:07:08,625
but I think there is a good
reason to talk about securing
cyber space. And not just

65
00:07:08,625 --> 00:07:14,125
information space, or
information policy. And in fact
I will also buy a drink to

66
00:07:14,125 --> 00:07:20,125
anyone who can tell me right now
where the word cyber, or the
prefix cyber, not the noun, not

67
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:27,750
the verb, but the prefix cyber,
where does that come from? Raise
a hand anyone? Yes?

68
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:33,750
>>	(Inaudible). >>	Yes you are
correct ma'am, in fact. Very
nice, I will buy you a drink

69
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:42,500
later. The lady mentioned it has
to do with a Greek origin. Let
me give you kind of short

70
00:07:44,792 --> 00:07:50,792
history lesson about that. This
guy, professor nor bit weaner,
that's his real name. He's a

71
00:07:53,042 --> 00:07:59,042
man  ‑ ‑ he was a math professor
here in the United States. And
in 1948, he developed a new

72
00:08:05,125 --> 00:08:08,625
scientific discipline called
cybernetics. He came up with
after he saw in World War II

73
00:08:08,625 --> 00:08:11,292
what new remote command
communication and consulting
technologies were doing. How

74
00:08:11,292 --> 00:08:16,917
radio has been transforming the
(inaudible). How the new concept
of digital computers is

75
00:08:16,917 --> 00:08:22,875
influencing signal intelligence.
And how new technologies out
into the world are making a

76
00:08:22,875 --> 00:08:27,958
transformative change. So to
(indiscernible) all of these
different control and

77
00:08:27,958 --> 00:08:32,750
communication systems in the
animal in the machine, that's
the name of his book, he used

78
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:37,000
the term cybernetics. He didn't
even know the type of
technologies they have right

79
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:44,417
now. But he did boar refrom the
ancient Greeks and rather for
their term, for the guy running

80
00:08:44,417 --> 00:08:50,375
the boat, the (indiscernible)
commanding controlling, and
communicating orders. That guy

81
00:08:50,375 --> 00:08:54,958
is maybe called in English a
captain, but in Greek, it is
called the (speaking another

82
00:08:54,958 --> 00:09:01,667
language.) And that is the
source for cyber. And actually
my home language of Hebrew, we

83
00:09:01,667 --> 00:09:07,333
still call the captain of a
boat, also the guy running the
country (speaking another

84
00:09:07,333 --> 00:09:14,750
language.). it comes from the
same origin. We can make fun of
cyber and whether it's a

85
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:20,208
relative term or not, but
cybernetics technologies
controlling and commanding

86
00:09:20,208 --> 00:09:26,375
stuff, this is how allow human
kind to have freaking laser
shooting robots running around

87
00:09:26,375 --> 00:09:32,375
on Mars. But also tweeting
about. This is all apart of the
same problem space and I think

88
00:09:35,417 --> 00:09:41,417
this asterisks describes
securing these technologies as
cyber security. In the past 25 

89
00:09:43,417 --> 00:09:49,667
years, these have been the
software environment, an IT
ecosystems where most

90
00:09:49,667 --> 00:09:53,875
vulnerabilities were being
(inaudible). This is a top ten
organization and software

91
00:09:53,875 --> 00:09:58,583
environment and have the most
vulnerability TS according to
force fire. 25  years of

92
00:09:58,583 --> 00:10:05,625
vulnerability report. That's
been our history. But the future
of our (inaudible) is not going

93
00:10:05,625 --> 00:10:10,875
to be about information
technology. It's going to be
about new devices, device  ‑ ‑

94
00:10:10,875 --> 00:10:17,042
not PCs, not web servers.
Devices, watches, ATMs,
(indiscernible) cars, that are

95
00:10:17,042 --> 00:10:22,250
running these vulnerable
software. And it's also going to
be about all of this other

96
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:28,250
stuff. Radio frequency and
global (indiscernible) systems.
And aircraft control. So this is

97
00:10:30,667 --> 00:10:35,958
a lot of different technologies
coming together. The same stuff
that allows the university of

98
00:10:35,958 --> 00:10:41,958
Texas hackers to hijack the
course of an $18  million yacht
by changing the signalling of

99
00:10:44,917 --> 00:10:50,750
the position information that
they were getting, by sending
out positioning signal that was

100
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:55,042
stronger than the one that was
on the boat. They tricked the
actual (indiscernible) man, the

101
00:10:55,042 --> 00:10:59,792
actual (speaking another
language.) Of the boat and sent
it going someplace else. It's

102
00:10:59,792 --> 00:11:05,125
the same stuff having setting
people take control of
instruments. And yeah, cyber

103
00:11:05,125 --> 00:11:11,125
security is also about
protecting a blue tooth enabled
toilet. So you know what guys,

104
00:11:13,542 --> 00:11:20,500
there is not one single
government vendor or any entity
that's secure all of this stuff.

105
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:26,500
It's a complicated problem. But
not only that, a lot of these
vendors and governments are like

106
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:36,042
new shifts have come to life,
man. And we have got to stop and
wrap our minds around this

107
00:11:36,042 --> 00:11:42,625
complicated boggle. And they are
somewhat correct, but you know
what else? Some of this is old

108
00:11:42,625 --> 00:11:50,000
shit connected in a new way. And
the only reason it is coming to
light in the first place is

109
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:56,167
because hackers are exposing it
and showing those
vulnerabilities. So to quote to

110
00:11:56,167 --> 00:12:03,792
late barn bee jack, sometimes it
just falls to us to demonstrate
the threat so we can spark the

111
00:12:03,792 --> 00:12:10,500
solution. And I wholeheartedly
agree. I think we have to keep
looking at these new

112
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:17,625
technologies. Because there is
no better (indiscernible) than
the light of day. If the hacker

113
00:12:17,625 --> 00:12:21,750
community makes the point of
researching vulnerable
technologies, whether they are

114
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:27,250
blue tooth enabled toilets,
smart homes, cars, medical
device, we will make some change

115
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:35,083
happen. And it is going to take
a bottom up approach. Not a top
down solution created by one

116
00:12:35,083 --> 00:12:41,167
company or regulator or one
government. You got to research
what matters in the worlds of

117
00:12:41,167 --> 00:12:47,958
josh and Nick from
(indiscernible). Just one years
ago they showed I think in this

118
00:12:47,958 --> 00:12:53,792
very room, in fact,
(indiscernible) Sunday right?
Telling hackers about why we

119
00:12:53,792 --> 00:12:58,417
have to start focussing our
research and efforts,
researching technologies that

120
00:12:58,417 --> 00:13:04,500
matter for protecting human life
and public safety. And
yesterday, after a year of

121
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:09,708
activities, they showed the
progress they have made. With
research in medical device

122
00:13:09,708 --> 00:13:16,167
security, automotive secure,
smart homes and infrastructures.
And I encourage you to check

123
00:13:16,167 --> 00:13:21,250
them out and see what they're up
to. But that's not the only way
you can make a difference. There

124
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:26,958
are many different ways. And I'm
going to go into that in a
second. I think I have to make a

125
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:32,958
quick stop now. Hi guys. So umm,
I have a nice life over there.
No ice for me. Another way to

126
00:13:42,375 --> 00:13:48,375
contribute and make positive
things happen, ooh wow, that's
nice. So, this is a bottle of

127
00:13:50,708 --> 00:13:56,708
12‑ year‑ old (indiscernible)
whisky I believe. Thank you.
(Applause.) >>	'Cause that's how

128
00:13:59,917 --> 00:14:05,917
she rolls. >>	True that, I kind
of make a point mentioning to
them I am a single malt girl and

129
00:14:08,125 --> 00:14:14,167
I will not drink bourbon
Tennessee, other types of
whisky. So building securely is

130
00:14:14,167 --> 00:14:20,167
a project  ‑ ‑   ‑ ‑ to offer
internet of things security for
people that are developing

131
00:14:23,792 --> 00:14:29,792
(inaudible) project. So it's an
easy way if you're interested in
some things, it's an easy way to

132
00:14:33,458 --> 00:14:39,208
get information project. And
before I move on to the next
one, thank you so much. >>	It's

133
00:14:39,208 --> 00:14:44,125
really hard to get accepted to
give a talk at DEF CON. Let's
give a big round of applause for

134
00:14:44,125 --> 00:14:50,125
our speaker. Show the love.
(Applause.) Cheers cheers.
>>	Thank you so much. >>	Thank

135
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:58,250
you. >>	(Speaking
simultaneously). >>	I'll check
in later then. >>	Okay. Thanks.

136
00:15:03,667 --> 00:15:09,667
Cheers. Thank you guys. I
appreciated that I got a glass
right. >>	(Inaudible) long talk.

137
00:15:16,542 --> 00:15:21,542
>>	The reason I only drink
single malt WIS key in a real
glass is because you know, it's

138
00:15:21,542 --> 00:15:26,833
spent 15  years in a barrel and
then some time in a bottle, I
just can't bare to put it in a

139
00:15:26,833 --> 00:15:32,833
plastic disposable cup. You know
what I mean? All right, on with
the show. So the plot thickens.

140
00:15:41,583 --> 00:15:47,708
Even with the best intentions in
mind, those governments and
vendors are not going to be able

141
00:15:47,708 --> 00:15:53,458
to solve the problem. But guess
what, some of them don't have
the best intentions in mind. In

142
00:15:53,458 --> 00:15:59,458
fact, there are huge resources
at work actually keeping the
world vulnerable. In the past

143
00:16:02,042 --> 00:16:07,542
year, we've all been perhaps
shocked to learn exactly how
much money the NSA has been

144
00:16:07,542 --> 00:16:14,875
spending on buying a our
vulnerabilities. Then we learned
they even went as far as to pay

145
00:16:14,875 --> 00:16:20,750
a security company to include
the deliberately weak random
number generator and make it a

146
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:26,750
default in one of their core
(indiscernible) qualities. Now a
few months ago, as the openness

147
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:35,833
vulnerability became known to
the President Clinton, it was
also alleged that the NSA has

148
00:16:35,833 --> 00:16:41,292
knowledge of this and expected
it for years. Now that might not
be true, but it is safe to

149
00:16:41,292 --> 00:16:46,875
assume that similar things have
been going on. And so there is a
little bit of a paradox at play

150
00:16:46,875 --> 00:16:52,875
here. Because security agencies,
security agencies have been
making the world deliberately

151
00:16:55,167 --> 00:17:03,125
insecure. And that's part of the
problem we have got to be
facing. What's really making my

152
00:17:03,125 --> 00:17:10,833
own heart plead if you don't
mine, is STOIry stories like
this. Cover of time magazine

153
00:17:10,833 --> 00:17:17,500
last month. You probably
haven't, but you've seen the
headline. It says World War 0.

154
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:24,958
The global battle to steel your
secret is turning hackers into
armed dealers. Get it guys. We

155
00:17:24,958 --> 00:17:30,750
are the armed dealers. Not the
government agencies. Not the
vendors, not the companies

156
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:37,250
selling 0 data to the highest
bidder. This really does break
my heart. Because I think a

157
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:44,667
small group of people making a
profit by selling 0  days is
painting all of us in a bad

158
00:17:44,667 --> 00:17:50,667
life. So what's the solution to
this? How can you avoid being
the armed dealers. I think we

159
00:17:56,125 --> 00:18:02,417
can start by not keeping our
(indiscernible)s to ourself. Tip
ST scale and disrupt the 0  days

160
00:18:02,417 --> 00:18:08,417
on vulnerability market. Yes
there will always be 0  days.  
‑ ‑ before the bad guys do,

161
00:18:10,667 --> 00:18:18,417
we're going to make their life
harder. And in fact, the reality
is, never before have there been

162
00:18:18,417 --> 00:18:25,250
so many different avenues for
hackers to disclose bugs and
didn't get paid for them. We all

163
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:30,208
know about bug bounty programs
like competitions like
(indiscernible) to own. There

164
00:18:30,208 --> 00:18:36,583
are literally dozens if not
hundreds of bug bounty programs
out there by specific vendors. I

165
00:18:36,583 --> 00:18:43,833
think that's a fantastic thing.
It's transformation in our
industry. There's also the

166
00:18:43,833 --> 00:18:49,292
internet bug bounty project
started by (indiscernible) first
and hacker one. That is a great

167
00:18:49,292 --> 00:18:55,292
avenue. Hi. Casey's right there
by the way. Give her hand.
(Applause.) So things like the

168
00:18:59,625 --> 00:19:06,083
internet bug bounty is this
fantastic way to have an
incentive  ‑ ‑   ‑ ‑ that are

169
00:19:06,083 --> 00:19:12,083
maybe open source or not managed
by specific vendor and still get
paid. And I think that's great.

170
00:19:15,208 --> 00:19:21,208
Google's announcement of project
0 also give us some room for
hope. But again, the plot

171
00:19:24,875 --> 00:19:31,958
thickens, and it will need our
help. There are a lot of
companies and organizations that

172
00:19:31,958 --> 00:19:37,667
do not have bug bounty programs.
That do not have disclosure
policies. And the reason they

173
00:19:37,667 --> 00:19:43,417
can do that because they can
afford not to have that. They
can sweep up the bugs under the

174
00:19:43,417 --> 00:19:50,875
carpet or ignore them or pay a
little  ‑ ‑ or pay a lot to
those companies selling the bugs

175
00:19:50,875 --> 00:19:56,417
quietly and never fix them. So
we have to work that much
harder. We have researching

176
00:19:56,417 --> 00:20:03,375
vulnerability disclosing them.
And make it so these companies
and organizations cannot afford

177
00:20:03,375 --> 00:20:10,000
not to have a disclosure policy
in place. Or a bug bounty
program. Again, there is no

178
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,458
(indiscernible) infection than
the light of day. And it is
going to take a bottom's up

179
00:20:14,458 --> 00:20:20,458
approach. When I say bottoms
up... (Applause.) So we don't
have to be polite about

180
00:20:26,333 --> 00:20:31,958
disclosing vulnerabilities. We
can start polite, but if they
don't listen  ‑ ‑ database. But

181
00:20:31,958 --> 00:20:37,958
I see some of the faces here in
the audience are still kind of
like this. Not convinced are

182
00:20:40,667 --> 00:20:46,667
you? Why should you care right?
Just security professionals, you
want to protect your own little

183
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:54,667
piece of heaven from all the bad
stuff out there. You want to be
doing your stuff and not let all

184
00:20:54,667 --> 00:21:00,792
the bad stuff touch you. Well I
want to tell you two more
reasons, two more problems why

185
00:21:00,792 --> 00:21:08,625
ink each of us as a security
professional needs to care about
securing cyber space as a whole,

186
00:21:08,625 --> 00:21:14,625
a big problem space of all
technologies. The first reason,
which is burden overall, we are

187
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:21,667
only as weak as our weakest
link. That's not a mistake.
We're not as strong as our

188
00:21:21,667 --> 00:21:27,750
weakest link, we're as weak as
our weakest link. In the past
year, we learned you could be a

189
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:34,917
retailer have a multimillion
dollar security program in
place, you will still get

190
00:21:34,917 --> 00:21:40,917
(indiscernible) because you're
lame as  ‑ ‑ out of bumps
wherever, didn't bother to put

191
00:21:43,125 --> 00:21:48,583
antivirus in place. You can be
one of the world's leading
security companies and develop

192
00:21:48,583 --> 00:21:54,792
the cutting edge one time pass
ward security (indiscernible)
mechanism. All it takes is one

193
00:21:54,792 --> 00:22:01,875
e‑ mail, one spear fishing e‑
mail to your parent company with
one slash vulnerability embedded

194
00:22:01,875 --> 00:22:07,875
in an excel file. Not X files. I
was a fan you know, so. Still
waiting for MULDer. Anyway. This

195
00:22:13,208 --> 00:22:20,167
is all it takes to implicate
that multiple dollar security
company in the fact that the J

196
00:22:20,167 --> 00:22:26,167
22 model out of change due china
looks a lot like the F 35 model
made by Lockheed Martin. And so,

197
00:22:30,125 --> 00:22:37,500
it might be a question of time
before one of your providers,
your partners, your customers,

198
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:44,708
your employees, will mess it up.
And get you owned in the
process. So you have to care

199
00:22:44,708 --> 00:22:50,708
about the security of other
organizations and people you are
in touch with. But this problem

200
00:22:50,708 --> 00:22:57,375
also has another aspect to it.
And that is everybody's actually
on the front line. Guess what,

201
00:22:57,375 --> 00:23:03,250
there are no fierce cyber
warrior defending the perimeter.
Because there's no perimeter. We

202
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:10,292
are all civilians in the cyber
space and using the same
infrastructure. YOUN those

203
00:23:10,292 --> 00:23:15,417
people who say why should I
bother to secure my Facebook
account. If you're not part of

204
00:23:15,417 --> 00:23:21,417
the solution, you are part of
the problem. These are exactly
the people and organizations and

205
00:23:24,208 --> 00:23:29,625
companies that don't bother
enough and then their resources,
their digital assets, their

206
00:23:29,625 --> 00:23:37,000
cloud and social media profiles
and e‑ mail systems become just
a launching bad for the next

207
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:43,000
effect on you. Now I'd like to
move on because I think if we
don't take the time to solve

208
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:51,625
this problem, then we are all
going to be part of a bot net or
our machines are going to be

209
00:23:51,625 --> 00:23:55,375
part of fishing campaigns. We
all heard about these problems.
They're pervasive. So what can

210
00:23:55,375 --> 00:24:01,375
we do faced with a complicated
nature of this problem? You
could always join the Amish.

211
00:24:06,917 --> 00:24:13,583
That might work for some people.
But that's (indiscernible)
bones. Yeah, they now have smart

212
00:24:13,583 --> 00:24:19,375
phones as well. That's a good
point. So maybe the Amish are
not that safe anymore. Perhaps

213
00:24:19,375 --> 00:24:25,708
another approach then might be
to start working together. To
start collaborating and not

214
00:24:25,708 --> 00:24:31,708
being shy about saying how
exactly we were breeched and
what were our problem. Reaching

215
00:24:31,708 --> 00:24:38,000
out of your industry, your
sector, your community, there
are so many information sharing

216
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:44,000
programs, so many ways to share
this technical and practical
information about, how you got

217
00:24:47,125 --> 00:24:52,375
own so the next guy doesn't. ‑ ‑
I'm saying you should be doing
this, collaborating and sharing

218
00:24:52,375 --> 00:24:59,042
information because you're going
to be a text next. And you're
not knowing the malware is

219
00:24:59,042 --> 00:25:05,042
coming at you unless you talk to
your partners and competitors at
times. But where we are going to

220
00:25:09,458 --> 00:25:15,625
get I think the most bang for
the buck as it were, is by
empowering the mass  ‑ ‑ the

221
00:25:15,625 --> 00:25:20,708
shiny happy people that don't
think they have anything to
hide. Nobody's looking at them,

222
00:25:20,708 --> 00:25:25,583
but nobody's interested in the
device of their machine, the
credentials et cetera. These are

223
00:25:25,583 --> 00:25:30,208
the people we have to start
talking to. And there are
various ways to make that

224
00:25:30,208 --> 00:25:36,542
happen. One thing I like is
crystal parties. These have been
hugely popular in Europe and

225
00:25:36,542 --> 00:25:42,542
Germany. And there's a wiki and
how to to throw a crypto party
in your home down. It's a

226
00:25:45,542 --> 00:25:51,708
community event where you teach
basic security, privacy and
cryptography measures to regular

227
00:25:51,708 --> 00:25:57,750
people. But you don't just teach
them, you actually configure the
stuff on their devices. So maybe

228
00:25:57,750 --> 00:26:03,750
they can learn how to use PGP. I
know it's a bit hard. And other
ways to be supportive is policy

229
00:26:05,875 --> 00:26:12,042
organization that changing
public opinion by raising
awareness but also challenging

230
00:26:12,042 --> 00:26:18,500
and renegotiating the terms of
engagement with government
civilians and the technologies

231
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:24,792
in between. Now I'd like to tell
you about something pretty cool
that we actually did back home.

232
00:26:24,792 --> 00:26:30,792
Which is a little bit out of the
box I think. We called it red
cyber team. And this is one of

233
00:26:30,792 --> 00:26:37,042
the group of volunteers. Maybe
one of them is even here today.
(Indiscernible) you around? All

234
00:26:37,042 --> 00:26:42,000
right. He's hiding. So this was
a group of volunteers. People
who are (indiscernible)s and in

235
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:47,333
their day job, they do security
assessment. They brought
themselves together, and in the

236
00:26:47,333 --> 00:26:53,583
course of a few afternoons,
maybe a month or two, they
visited a local hospital outside

237
00:26:53,583 --> 00:26:59,458
tell VOOEF. That didn't really
have budget or awareness or
security issues at all. After

238
00:26:59,458 --> 00:27:06,042
they went in is and show it had
hospital management exactly what
they could do, that turned

239
00:27:06,042 --> 00:27:12,792
things around and that got that
organization to pay attention to
security. They did follow a code

240
00:27:12,792 --> 00:27:17,667
of ethics when they did what
they the did. In the end, they
only got a (indiscernible) hat

241
00:27:17,667 --> 00:27:24,292
and the fit feeling that they
did something good. I'd like to
offer you a way to own some

242
00:27:24,292 --> 00:27:29,583
bonus points if it were in the
effort to make the world a
better place. I know that sounds

243
00:27:29,583 --> 00:27:36,875
kind of corny. Sisco estimates
that we're going to need one
million more security

244
00:27:36,875 --> 00:27:44,000
professionals in the coming
year. Now, it's time we started
procreating. It's time that we,

245
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:50,500
as a industry, yeah right? It's
time that we as an industry
begin propagating and making

246
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:56,625
more supported specialists out
there. You can do this by
reaching out to someone.

247
00:27:56,625 --> 00:28:02,125
Creating a mentor.   ‑ ‑   ‑ ‑
company or organization by
talking to people. Something I

248
00:28:02,125 --> 00:28:08,000
do a lot is go speak with
computer science and engineering
students in high schools and

249
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:14,458
colleges. And I just tell them
what they can do in the cyber
security industry. And they seem

250
00:28:14,458 --> 00:28:19,667
pretty excited. And I hope many
of them become security
professionals. Now you cannot do

251
00:28:19,667 --> 00:28:25,500
anything about this. And guess
what, there will be one more,
one million more security

252
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:29,417
professionals. Because the
market is going to need them.
They're just not going to be as

253
00:28:29,417 --> 00:28:35,292
qualified as you guys like them
to be. That should be an
incentive to start reaching out

254
00:28:35,292 --> 00:28:41,292
now. Overall, what I'm
suggesting is that we empower
these shiny happy people to be a

255
00:28:43,417 --> 00:28:49,625
bit more like us. Right? To be
armed to the fists, to be there
with us on the front line.

256
00:28:49,625 --> 00:28:55,667
Because they're only going to be
as secure as we help them
become. And if we don't, they're

257
00:28:55,667 --> 00:29:02,958
going to drag us down. So that's
one way, or actually I described
a couple ways you can do good

258
00:29:02,958 --> 00:29:10,708
things. But to kind of wrap
things up, I'd like to ask you
who here knows what has been a

259
00:29:10,708 --> 00:29:18,083
phenomena causing power outages
in the United States that's also
(indiscernible) on  ‑ ‑ in the

260
00:29:18,083 --> 00:29:26,000
past 20  years. I'm sure
somebody can guess. That's
right. It is the squirrels. You

261
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:31,875
guys know your stuff. For those
who don't, in the pretty
extensive SUR way, the New York

262
00:29:31,875 --> 00:29:38,083
Times did last sum E they found
out squirrels munching on power
line|s, I mean the actual

263
00:29:38,083 --> 00:29:45,417
animals, eating power cables
were the cause of a lot of power
outages. This was actually

264
00:29:45,417 --> 00:29:49,708
mentioned here at DEF CON by I
believe (indiscernible) a  ‑ ‑
Yes we don't see billions of

265
00:29:49,708 --> 00:29:55,708
dollars persistent squirrel
preventive technologies. A
mystery. This is because the the

266
00:30:02,750 --> 00:30:10,667
fuzz of cyber has taken over. We
can raise our hands and say kids
get off my lawn or try to change

267
00:30:10,667 --> 00:30:17,750
this. For those of you not
familiar with the term fuzz,
fear uncertainty and doubt this

268
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:23,750
is actually originally developed
as a scare tactic by IBM sales
people in the seventies. They

269
00:30:27,542 --> 00:30:32,542
wanted to prevent competitors
from selling technology to the
customers. They told them

270
00:30:32,542 --> 00:30:40,000
there's no telling what's going
to happen if you buy that stuff,
but today, FUD is being used to

271
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:46,458
funnel billion of dollars into
government agencies and military
work and hacking  ‑ ‑   ‑ ‑

272
00:30:46,458 --> 00:30:53,583
offensive and defensive
technology that's simply not
going to help the everyday

273
00:30:53,583 --> 00:31:00,167
people. So the public is kept in
constant fear  ‑ ‑   ‑ ‑
pixlated apocalypse that's right

274
00:31:00,167 --> 00:31:06,167
around the corner. Have you
heard of digital pearl harbor,
that kind of stuff. That kind of

275
00:31:08,208 --> 00:31:14,833
stuff keeps it vague and scary
and in the hands of government
and militants. Where actually,

276
00:31:14,833 --> 00:31:20,375
where I believe most of the
problems are, are in the
civilian cyber space. Regular

277
00:31:20,375 --> 00:31:27,000
people and regular companies.
Not the mill TARZed weapon
stuff. How can we stop the

278
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,750
spread of FUD. You can fight FUD
with facts. You can seek the
truth out for yourself. And when

279
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:36,750
somebody use AS vague term like
millions of cyber attacks are
being stopped each day, ask them

280
00:31:42,625 --> 00:31:50,083
millions of what? Millions of
packets? Millions of port scans?
Millions of infected devices

281
00:31:50,083 --> 00:31:56,083
communicating with the CMC
server? Be concrete with the
terms. You know in biology, we

282
00:31:58,417 --> 00:32:04,792
can hear about the ten million
microbes living in this bottle
if people don't get sick all the

283
00:32:04,792 --> 00:32:09,375
time. You're going to be using
concrete terms that have
relevance to our industry, to

284
00:32:09,375 --> 00:32:14,625
our field. And it's easy to go
out to those high numbers A.
Billion cyber attacks on

285
00:32:14,625 --> 00:32:21,792
counting microbes. Once they
seek out that information for
ourselves, and I think that is

286
00:32:21,792 --> 00:32:29,333
something this industry, you
know this community is very good
at doing because you know, raise

287
00:32:29,333 --> 00:32:35,958
your hands if you're allergic
to  ‑ ‑ That is I believe a
defining characteristic of our

288
00:32:35,958 --> 00:32:41,167
community. It's good, it's good
to have that. But it's also
important not just to be

289
00:32:41,167 --> 00:32:46,167
allergic to bullshit to have
that knee jerk reaction, but
also speak down OT information

290
00:32:46,167 --> 00:32:51,667
that's really happening. And
once you know what's up,
communicate that out bounds.

291
00:32:51,667 --> 00:32:58,542
Communicate it outside of our
community. There is a gap
between us. A gap between the

292
00:32:58,542 --> 00:33:03,125
hacker world and the rest of
them. And we have to be mindful
of that gap and keep preaching

293
00:33:03,125 --> 00:33:09,125
out and telling people what it's
like so they're not this warted
by the fog of FUD. The problem

294
00:33:11,875 --> 00:33:17,875
of FUD flows both ways. Certain
government, agency, certain
decision makers, if you pardon

295
00:33:20,292 --> 00:33:26,500
my French, they eat where they
shit. That means, they're also
feeding the public with the same

296
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:32,500
FUD they're being fed. Those are
a lot of Fs. I need a drink. So
they're being fed with the same

297
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:48,167
FUD they are spreading. You know
how they say there is no patch
for human stability? That is not

298
00:33:48,167 --> 00:33:54,708
accurate. Because if we expect
the decision making people and
the decision making algorithm

299
00:33:54,708 --> 00:33:59,083
are not going to change, we can
still influence the
(indiscernible). We can still

300
00:33:59,083 --> 00:34:03,458
make sure that the information
that the decision makers are
getting and the way that they

301
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:11,250
are keeping these issues that
will matter to everybody are
concrete, honest, not laced with

302
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:17,250
if you had and bullshit and high
PESH la. So many meetings with
congress people et cetera. You

303
00:34:21,958 --> 00:34:26,750
can do the same thing in your
own communities and countries.
To wrap things up, I think the

304
00:34:26,750 --> 00:34:32,750
internet needs you not to grow
cool facial hair, but rather to
save it for the future. And

305
00:34:39,083 --> 00:34:44,792
there are five things that we
can all start doing right now.
And you know what's the cool

306
00:34:44,792 --> 00:34:50,417
thing about it? We don't need to
ask for permission. We are
hackers, we can do whatever we

307
00:34:50,417 --> 00:34:57,792
like. We don't need a key, we'll
break in right? So to summarize,
we can be researching the

308
00:34:57,792 --> 00:35:03,125
technology that affect human
life and safety. We could be
researching stuff that matters.

309
00:35:03,125 --> 00:35:08,167
We have to, you know, disclose
more bugs, find more
vulnerabilities and get more

310
00:35:08,167 --> 00:35:14,250
information out there one way or
another. We can collaborate and
share within our industry

311
00:35:14,250 --> 00:35:20,458
community but also outside of
it. And we can empower the
masses so that they don't have

312
00:35:20,458 --> 00:35:28,375
to  ‑ ‑ are going to have red
mohawks. And of course, stop the
spread of FUD, which is

313
00:35:28,375 --> 00:35:35,125
something everyone can do just
like  ‑ ‑ to help the spread of
microbes. Now let's reflect on

314
00:35:35,125 --> 00:35:41,125
everything I've told you. I
claim TA GFTs will |fame to a
certain extent to claim cyber

315
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:49,750
space and (indiscernible) space
for the rest of us. We can argue
about how big the failure will

316
00:35:52,667 --> 00:35:59,000
be, how (inaudible) the extent
of it. We can argue about what
are we going to do about it. But

317
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:05,000
one thing I don't think we can
argue about is can we afford not
to do anything right now? And so

318
00:36:07,125 --> 00:36:14,292
yeah, we can use our powers to
read people's e‑ mails. That's
fine. We can also use our power

319
00:36:14,292 --> 00:36:21,208
to be this guy to save the
world. Or maybe more like this
guy, if you're a cyber fan like

320
00:36:21,208 --> 00:36:27,208
myself. You could call me in a
sense, naive, adorable, as some
people have been known to do.

321
00:36:30,917 --> 00:36:38,208
You can say that I am a romantic
hacker that expects things that
are not reasonable. I grew up

322
00:36:38,208 --> 00:36:43,917
with my little ponies, but also
with hackers and gadgets and
(indiscernible)s. And I'm

323
00:36:43,917 --> 00:36:49,625
excited to see the science
technology I imagineed a
reality. I think in that

324
00:36:49,625 --> 00:36:55,625
reality, hacking is magic. And
it can save the world. Thank
you. That's overwhelming. Thank

325
00:37:12,458 --> 00:37:17,375
you guys. You're too fine. Guys
and girls I might add. This
year, I've seen more ladies at

326
00:37:17,375 --> 00:37:23,375
DEF CON than ever. (Applause.)
Yeah, keep coming here ladies.
And so let me know what do you

327
00:37:29,667 --> 00:37:35,583
choose to do. Red pill or blue
pill, part of the problem or
part of the solution? And you

328
00:37:35,583 --> 00:37:41,333
can easily find me on twitter or
the interweb and you can also
send me multicolored

329
00:37:41,333 --> 00:37:48,708
(indiscernible)s if you think
that I'm romantic. But I hope
you join this and become part of

330
00:37:48,708 --> 00:37:54,708
the solution. Thank you guys.
(Applause.) I think we may have
a minute or a couple for

331
00:38:04,083 --> 00:38:10,333
questions. All of the hand
waving and signalling. That
might have something to do with

332
00:38:10,333 --> 00:38:16,333
the WIS key. I see a guy over
there. >>	So I don't think
you're naive. What areas are you

333
00:38:20,583 --> 00:38:26,625
personally dressing with
(indiscernible) process of what
it is that you would want to see

334
00:38:26,625 --> 00:38:32,500
or have done. Specifically
what's happening right now over
in your own country. >>	Okay. So

335
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:36,542
actually specifically with
what's happening right now in my
country. That's a good question.

336
00:38:36,542 --> 00:38:42,500
I have a story to reply with
that. I can clean it up. Anyone
know what that is? IE row dome.

337
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:48,500
The missile defense system
that's been intercepting rockets
that have been fired  ‑ ‑   ‑ ‑

338
00:38:50,750 --> 00:38:56,958
don't worry this is not
political. A few weeks ago brine
KREBs broke a story about how

339
00:38:56,958 --> 00:39:04,750
some of the defense companies
developing iron dome has been
breeched by Chinese hackers. The

340
00:39:04,750 --> 00:39:11,958
story made the rounds on BBC.
Business insider, guardian, a
bunch of others. And the

341
00:39:11,958 --> 00:39:19,833
headline started to volt. And by
the time they got into Israel
media, the headlines read iron

342
00:39:19,833 --> 00:39:26,875
dome needs a cyber iron dome. As
I was getting ready to come out
here to DEF CON, I within the to

343
00:39:26,875 --> 00:39:33,750
see my hairdresser. Obviously an
important person in my life
right? And he was like I know

344
00:39:33,750 --> 00:39:39,208
you're in the cyber security
stuff. What's going on? Are the
Chinese hackers now controlling

345
00:39:39,208 --> 00:39:46,083
the rockets over our heads? And
what I do when I'm faced with
that sort of fear, uncertainty,

346
00:39:46,083 --> 00:39:51,167
and doubt, I go back to the
media and the people I'm in
touch with with people in the

347
00:39:51,167 --> 00:39:57,083
university and other people in
Israel, and say listen, let's
get the facts right. What

348
00:39:57,083 --> 00:40:00,875
actually happened is that
several companies that have
something to do with the

349
00:40:00,875 --> 00:40:06,083
development of iron dome did
experience a breech. And those
companies responded that the

350
00:40:06,083 --> 00:40:11,292
breech happened three years ago
and it has some classified
documents lekked out the to

351
00:40:11,292 --> 00:40:17,292
potentially Chinese hackers
associated with a specific
threat, 61389, that it wasn't

352
00:40:24,125 --> 00:40:29,500
anything about iron dome,
specifically in it. And it was
not mean that some guy siting in

353
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:35,500
shanghai can now control the
rockets here in tell VOOEF. So
to answer your question sir S to

354
00:40:38,917 --> 00:40:44,917
talk to the people like that. I
go to the media. I talk to the
public  ‑ ‑ and I try to get the

355
00:40:47,708 --> 00:40:53,792
facts for myself so that I can
communicate them outside. Yes? A
question right here? I am not

356
00:40:53,792 --> 00:40:59,458
familiar with you guys. So if
you have a question, wave
perfusely. You guys and then one

357
00:40:59,458 --> 00:41:05,458
guy over the back. >>	How do we
get more women in security?
>>	That is a fantastic question.

358
00:41:10,375 --> 00:41:16,375
I actually, one of the panels I
submitted, but it was rejected.
Never mind, I got over it. Not

359
00:41:20,750 --> 00:41:28,625
(inaudible) all no. I think one
way is by creating accessible
role models. For me it was

360
00:41:28,625 --> 00:41:35,958
Angelina Jolie. For other people
it might be different women. And
I think it's critical we get

361
00:41:35,958 --> 00:41:42,000
more speakers and
(indiscernible) and talk not
just about technical stuff, but

362
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:49,000
also about our specific career
paths. I speak to girls who are
learning computer science back

363
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:55,250
in Israel all the time. I tell
them how I got start. What's the
security industry like. Is it

364
00:41:55,250 --> 00:42:00,708
true that there are only boys at
DEF CON. No I tell them it's not
true. And every year I've been

365
00:42:00,708 --> 00:42:08,125
coming, I've seen more women. I
tell them that. And I think it's
a good question too because we

366
00:42:08,125 --> 00:42:13,750
are going to need, you know,
that 50  percent of the
potential work force. So my

367
00:42:13,750 --> 00:42:19,625
response would be accessible
role models and getting more of
that out. There's another side

368
00:42:19,625 --> 00:42:25,792
to that, and that's something
you guys can do. You know our
black hats, white hats, don't be

369
00:42:25,792 --> 00:42:31,792
a douche hat. (Laughing) thank
you. There was a guy over there
in the back. Yell. Okay, so the

370
00:43:03,792 --> 00:43:07,958
question was in academia a lot
of the (indiscernible) is
focused on the military side of

371
00:43:07,958 --> 00:43:15,667
thingings. And not enough on the
civilian side and the civilian
role and security matters to

372
00:43:15,667 --> 00:43:21,708
civilian societies and how can
we counterthat? So one thing
that I am a big believer in is

373
00:43:21,708 --> 00:43:26,792
having always that one leg in
academia. My research fellow
with tell -inaudible-

374
00:43:26,792 --> 00:43:31,417
university. And I constantly
talk about this stuff. We talk
about things like anonymous and

375
00:43:31,417 --> 00:43:38,167
private individuals who are
making a difference in the
security industry. We talk about

376
00:43:38,167 --> 00:43:45,042
the role of. I don't know here
in the United States, it might
be different, but in IZ really,

377
00:43:45,042 --> 00:43:49,417
the tell code (indiscernible)
the civilian companies are not
doing inform. They keep saying

378
00:43:49,417 --> 00:43:57,083
that. Every place I get in
university, and outside of
university. I also kind of am

379
00:43:57,083 --> 00:44:03,083
using the university as almost
like back door in a way. Don't
tell them right. But I'm using

380
00:44:06,167 --> 00:44:11,167
that to influence public
opinion. Because university
(indiscernible)s where the prime

381
00:44:11,167 --> 00:44:17,167
minister comes down. It's a
prime minister. And I try to
make sure at those events, the

382
00:44:17,167 --> 00:44:23,375
content and questions about not
just military and strategic
cyber war and stuff, but also

383
00:44:23,375 --> 00:44:30,000
practical cyber war security
issues and everybody raised. All
right guys I think that's all

384
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:36,000
the time. >>	One more question
please. It's over here. Do you
think it's time for us to take

385
00:44:39,875 --> 00:44:47,500
back the word hacker. It's not
cyber criminal, it's not
attacker, and when somebody says

386
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:53,375
a hacker did this and hacker did
that we need to say no that's a
criminal. That's a nation state

387
00:44:53,375 --> 00:45:00,542
hacker. And something specific,
than say hacker which is lazy.
>>	Personally I have to say,

388
00:45:00,542 --> 00:45:07,000
I've been proud to use the term
hacker. I've been proud to say
I'm part of the hacker

389
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:13,667
community. I never thought it
was a negative thing. I always
thought it was a badge of honor.

390
00:45:13,667 --> 00:45:19,792
Honestly, I think the term
hacker implies capability. It
implied intuition and curiosity.

391
00:45:19,792 --> 00:45:26,250
And then what it call comes down
to is the actual individual
choices the hacker makes.

392
00:45:26,250 --> 00:45:31,625
Whether they choose to become a
cyber warier defending their
nation, whether they become a

393
00:45:31,625 --> 00:45:36,875
cyber criminal, a hack VIS.
Those are career paths.
Personally, I think it's

394
00:45:36,875 --> 00:45:42,875
important to use the term hacker
in every opportunity I get. My
first line| my I first sentence

395
00:45:46,667 --> 00:45:52,667
is a security researcher did
that. Otherwise known as a
heark. I put them together to

396
00:45:55,167 --> 00:45:58,958
make it clear that this is the
sort of thing that's being done
by hackers and it's a good

397
00:45:58,958 --> 00:46:04,958
thing. Each of us has to make
their own decisions about how
they are proud or how they want

398
00:46:04,958 --> 00:46:11,042
to represent themselves. But by
being good hackers in a way, I
know it sounds like care bare

399
00:46:11,042 --> 00:46:18,042
stuff, but I like the care
bares. They're cool. But by
being a good hacker, we can

400
00:46:18,042 --> 00:46:25,083
redeem that image and we can
say, yeah, hackers did that. And
