1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,292
>>Now we are going to talk about
cars. I bought my first adult
car. A Volkswagen. Turns out

2
00:00:05,292 --> 00:00:09,958
German cars are a long troll
just to take your money ‑‑ this
had all of the fancy stuff. I

3
00:00:09,958 --> 00:00:15,958
used to listen to big timers in
college. They talked about frog
eye headlights which my car has.

4
00:00:28,208 --> 00:00:34,208
Then I hit a Coyote. There are
like 40 headlights that go up
and down. I had to keep taking

5
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:44,500
my car back and forth. My point
is: In cars these days all kinds
of shit can break and shit that

6
00:00:47,417 --> 00:00:52,667
might be really problematic.
That is what Charlie and Chris
and going to talk about right

7
00:00:52,667 --> 00:00:58,667
now. So, let's give these two a
big Party Track welcome.
(Applause) >> How's everyone

8
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,000
doing? Hangover's a gone? Still
drunk? I think you all know
Charlie. He is kind of Internet

9
00:01:16,417 --> 00:01:22,417
famous. He works at Twitter. I
am Chris Valasek. I work at IO
hacker. We have been doing car

10
00:01:26,583 --> 00:01:34,125
stuff a while. Nice enough to
have us here last year as well.
This year, Black Hat was

11
00:01:34,125 --> 00:01:40,125
practice. Now the real thing. >>
Now we have the kinks out. We
can deliver the real deal. We

12
00:01:44,917 --> 00:01:50,917
have introductory staff to go
over. How car stuff works. Talk
about cyber stuff. Then we will

13
00:01:56,417 --> 00:02:01,458
cruise through remote survey. If
you really want to read about
that stuff you should check the

14
00:02:01,458 --> 00:02:07,458
paper. It is already out. I will
release it on the blog next week
as well. 95 a pages of details

15
00:02:09,917 --> 00:02:15,583
about all of the cars we looked
at, our thoughts and
conclusions. If you are really

16
00:02:15,583 --> 00:02:21,958
interested, this is our song and
dance ‑‑ read the paper. >> But
he who is going to do that? >> I

17
00:02:21,958 --> 00:02:25,792
wouldn't. I wrote it. >> Last
year: Four downloads. >> The
blog had like a zillion.

18
00:02:25,792 --> 00:02:31,792
Reading's stupid. That is why I
watch movies. (Multiple voices).
>> Half a gig. That is why we

19
00:02:42,375 --> 00:02:48,458
never release the slides: They
are too hard to download.
Lastly, we will talk about some

20
00:02:48,458 --> 00:02:54,458
algorithms and a little device
that Charlie and I came up with
to stop the attacks that we have

21
00:02:56,542 --> 00:03:02,542
known about so far. There is not
going to be any remote cells.
More of academic. Except we

22
00:03:04,792 --> 00:03:10,792
actually release stuff. It's
really motivated to talk about
remote attacks and ‑‑ Frankly it

23
00:03:15,792 --> 00:03:21,792
comes out to how we pick be our
cars for research which was very
scientific I would describe it.

24
00:03:24,167 --> 00:03:30,167
>> How much money can we have.
That is how we choose cars. >>
Computer control. After last

25
00:03:34,417 --> 00:03:39,042
year we wanted to do research
and talk about remote things.
(Off microphone). >> We were

26
00:03:39,042 --> 00:03:43,500
like let's do research on which
car to buy. >> That was probably
a little misguided first time

27
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:49,500
around. Turns out I wases
talking to academic guys they
were like before we put a bought

28
00:03:51,583 --> 00:03:54,625
our car we bought all these,
manufacturers. Great idea. I
wish we would have done that.

29
00:03:54,625 --> 00:04:00,500
Which cars park them receives
sweet. Can we afford that? Let's
do it. (Off microphone) Talking

30
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:06,500
about which car we are going to
buy. Hey, other people might be
interested. Charlie had the

31
00:04:14,042 --> 00:04:19,750
special treat for you at the
end. Basically, the talk sucks.
But if you stay to the last five

32
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:25,542
minutes I promise it's all good.
Now a days, everyone seems
interested. As soon as there is

33
00:04:25,542 --> 00:04:31,542
a car wreck now the first
question ends up being: Was the
car hacked. We don't know. But

34
00:04:34,417 --> 00:04:41,417
everyone seems really interested
in this now. It is cool research
to do. Popping shelves gets old

35
00:04:41,417 --> 00:04:49,250
at some point. You want to pop
something then smash it. That is
why I think we have had a blast

36
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:55,250
doing this. Got a lot of good
feedback and generally had a
good time. Remember when you

37
00:04:57,333 --> 00:05:03,333
crashed your car? >> Hacked. >>
Definitely hacked. >> We wanted
to get the facts out. If you are

38
00:05:17,333 --> 00:05:22,750
interested in remote attacks and
remott car research this is
going to tell you exactly what

39
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:30,583
you need to do. So you don't
have to his own to . . . It
should ‑‑ everyone ‑‑ you should

40
00:05:30,583 --> 00:05:36,708
be able to do that and wreck the
car and see from some of the
diagrams it is not really that

41
00:05:36,708 --> 00:05:42,042
straightforward. >> Right. >>
Some cars are one way, sop the
other. Not that straightforward

42
00:05:42,042 --> 00:05:48,042
some are less than others. Ours
have computers. Charlie and I
wanted to explain to you how

43
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:56,583
attacks work and we hired Pixar
to do a little animation. This
was the budget. They were all

44
00:06:01,458 --> 00:06:07,917
hieroglyphic characters. They
were the cheapest. Here is how
the remote attack works: Shadowy

45
00:06:07,917 --> 00:06:13,917
guy with computer, he does
Internet to things or wireless
to things. From there, the ‑‑

46
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:20,167
you could potentially have code
running. That is what we are
Kerned with. Not kind of

47
00:06:20,167 --> 00:06:26,750
eavesdropping and his E.
listening to things but want to
execute code on a computer. That

48
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:34,292
may be on the same network or a
different network which is
represented by the chip thing

49
00:06:34,292 --> 00:06:40,292
and that blue line. >> Step
one ‑‑ there are 310 steps in
remote attacks ‑‑ probably where

50
00:06:45,542 --> 00:06:51,542
the. (Off microphone) At that
point, you can't necessarily do
harm to the car. You know ‑‑

51
00:06:58,417 --> 00:07:02,708
maybe you could record their
voice. We don't car about that.
We want to crash. >> Smash them

52
00:07:02,708 --> 00:07:08,708
up. After you figure out how to
get on the computer can you send
messages as well. While most

53
00:07:11,458 --> 00:07:15,500
cars have steering angle
sensors, a lot do not park
themselves. That might mean you

54
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:20,917
don't control steering at all.
You have to figure out what
parts of the automobile were

55
00:07:20,917 --> 00:07:26,625
controllable by computer
messages. Were all of the parts
of the car are computerized

56
00:07:26,625 --> 00:07:30,625
doesn't mean the network
messages will be able to control
that all the time. >> That was

57
00:07:30,625 --> 00:07:38,583
our research last year. Step one
. . . step two can you send
message from radio lands. Step

58
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:44,583
three can you make it do
something. Our whole research
was can you send messages. Can

59
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:52,292
you make it do something. >>
Step four: Smash E. 'em up. That
usually ends up being step four.

60
00:07:57,792 --> 00:08:05,042
People have done this already.
It is not theoretical to have
wireless codec of a car,

61
00:08:05,042 --> 00:08:08,833
physical aspects, take control.
The researchers from the
University of Washington and

62
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:14,833
University of California did
this in ‑‑ 2011 (Car sounds) >>
Beep‑beep‑beep. That was the

63
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:32,250
Internet. That looks dangerous.
Here is a test track (Making car
sounds) Look out. There is

64
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:42,250
something in the road. I hear
something. They were able to get
execution ‑‑ able to lock the

65
00:09:03,833 --> 00:09:09,833
breaks and crash the car. >> We
were plugged into the vehicle.
We kind of did some different

66
00:09:12,292 --> 00:09:18,500
things. We leveraged the actual
normal cam [phonetic] messages.
This is a video of crashing a

67
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:24,500
reporter from Fox news. If you
have to crash a reporter, the
Fox News guy. >> Smashed in an

68
00:09:27,292 --> 00:09:33,292
'em bang. Off the road. As you
saw him, he kind of took his
hands off the wheel Charlie was

69
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:49,083
like don't do that. Then I
pressed the button. Wrecked. It
was all of. I was in the back ‑‑

70
00:09:54,125 --> 00:10:00,125
you guys can make . . . yeah, we
can. Okay. Show me. The camera
man was faced backwards in the

71
00:10:03,958 --> 00:10:09,958
camera seat. Went home to his
wife and kids probably and gave
them a big home. Did you guys

72
00:10:14,417 --> 00:10:20,583
mean to do that? Yeah.
Apologize? Shit. Earlier we were
like put your seat belt on. He

73
00:10:20,583 --> 00:10:26,792
was like I can't get the shot.
Listen, not my fault. All this
comes down to as Charlie said

74
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:32,792
before. We think remote hacking
for control has at least three
parts. Remote attacks. Everyone

75
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:42,250
is kind of familiar with that.
Everyone is familiar with
wireless communication. Look at

76
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:49,625
the cars, figure out which to
buy and hack. We wanted to
figure out which of the three

77
00:10:49,625 --> 00:10:55,625
steps would be the easiest. We
can't go out and buy 30 cars and
bluetooth ‑‑ time, effort, money

78
00:11:00,292 --> 00:11:05,458
we don't have all of it. What we
did, instead of actually doing
that we looked at the size

79
00:11:05,458 --> 00:11:11,458
first. We were like the bigger,
the more bugs, better chance of
gaining remote access. Try code.

80
00:11:20,708 --> 00:11:26,708
More code, more chance. That is
the way we figure it. Do you
have a different opinion? Then .

81
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:36,750
. . >> Get out! >> Come back for
the last five minutes. >> Other
part is cyber people: Take

82
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:46,750
messages that control physical
aspects. Adaptive cruise
control, car breaks if it sees a

83
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:53,000
car in front of it. City
driving, things like that. These
are ways that you almost can

84
00:11:53,000 --> 00:12:00,167
guarantee that you can send a
computer message. A lot of times
people used diagnostic messages.

85
00:12:00,167 --> 00:12:06,750
You may or may not be able to do
something. With cyberphysical
aspects, they are designed to ‑‑

86
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:12,750
>> We found, we did our research
on the Escape and Priu tee. The
Escape didn't have any ‑‑ we

87
00:12:15,625 --> 00:12:21,625
were not able to make the breaks
lock up and make them work which
was exciting. On the Prius they

88
00:12:26,042 --> 00:12:32,042
had a computer designed to send
messages on the cam bus for the
breaks. We had to do what they

89
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:42,750
do. It is a feature. When we
were trying to figure out of 30
cars which we want to buy ‑‑

90
00:12:47,375 --> 00:12:53,042
again we don't know whether the
breaks have a vulnerability we
want to engagement the most

91
00:12:53,042 --> 00:12:59,042
features are probably having the
most things you can control. We
wanted success with this. Don't

92
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:06,833
want to look like bigger losers
we already are. Remember the
battery ‑‑ >> Talk about

93
00:13:06,833 --> 00:13:12,833
failure. >>Literally did not
watch it. It was too
embarrassing. >> The third piece

94
00:13:15,417 --> 00:13:21,417
is network. A lot of this is
about. A lot of people,
especially the media were very

95
00:13:25,833 --> 00:13:32,125
keen on. Remember it is only
one‑third of the whole equation
we are talking about. Certain

96
00:13:32,125 --> 00:13:37,208
cars have certain features at
certain places. Not just this
big platform. They can be

97
00:13:37,208 --> 00:13:43,208
segregated. Certain cars may
provide challenges others don't.
With the second ‑‑ network. If

98
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:51,208
you attack, say, the radio and
you want to control, say, the
breaks, can you get messages

99
00:13:51,208 --> 00:13:56,125
from one to the other. Can
imagine a car designed that
there is no physical way to get

100
00:13:56,125 --> 00:14:00,083
messages from one to the other.
In which case you are safe. You
can attack my radio all you

101
00:14:00,083 --> 00:14:05,208
want, can't crash me, I am happy
with that. Other carses might
have on the same ECU ‑‑ could.

102
00:14:05,208 --> 00:14:13,125
Right next to each other in the
network, nothing in the way to
stop you from going from one to

103
00:14:13,125 --> 00:14:19,250
the other. Searched all three of
them, combined them, tried to
figure out which cars we would

104
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:25,250
have the most success trying to
do this on. As a prelude to next
year's show. >> Exactly. >> We

105
00:14:28,125 --> 00:14:33,125
have those cars. >> We got the
cars we want. Now we have to ‑‑
>> Or never hear from us. Ride

106
00:14:33,125 --> 00:14:39,125
off into the sunset and that
will be that. >> Features for
most people now are attack be

107
00:14:43,333 --> 00:14:47,042
surface [phonetic] these cars
are becoming more and more
complex and connected. That is

108
00:14:47,042 --> 00:14:53,042
why this work is even more
intriguing. Super, super
complicated computers on four

109
00:14:55,792 --> 00:15:01,792
wheels that can brake
themselves. Cars are
complicated. It will be cool to

110
00:15:11,542 --> 00:15:17,542
hack them. There are too many
cars for any two, three, 40, 100
individuals to look at it.

111
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:26,750
Everyone needs to look at it as
we look at code on the Internet.
People look at cars and

112
00:15:28,833 --> 00:15:33,125
information, how to do it. By
now, I figure we have it
covered. For some reason no one

113
00:15:33,125 --> 00:15:39,583
did it. Probably because the
tools are crap. But what are you
going to do. Remote attack

114
00:15:39,583 --> 00:15:45,583
service ‑‑ this was awesome. >>
But dash there is a lot of
remote attack servers we only

115
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:54,250
cover a few. I am taking my
time. >> Go with that. >> So we
are going to go in all different

116
00:15:56,458 --> 00:16:03,208
kinds of things you can imagine
is happening remotely, a
vehicle. We are going to sort of

117
00:16:03,208 --> 00:16:09,208
go in increasing range. The
first one we have here is ‑‑
what is it called? Passes ‑‑

118
00:16:12,833 --> 00:16:19,667
what is it called? >> It starts
the car. >> On the left you see.
(Off microphone). >> On the

119
00:16:19,667 --> 00:16:25,917
right is a little thing that
goes around dash. (Off
microphone) There is a little

120
00:16:25,917 --> 00:16:31,917
antenna in there. The data is
passed between it to make sure
only ‑‑ from an attack

121
00:16:35,417 --> 00:16:43,250
perspective, I don't care about
someone ‑‑ I care about can you
have a little radio station

122
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:49,667
sending radio waves that somehow
exploit a vulnerability in the
code, waiting for this

123
00:16:49,667 --> 00:16:57,042
information from the key? This
one does not seem that lime the
not much data a sent over radio.

124
00:16:57,042 --> 00:17:02,667
It is a couple of millimeters.
While it is an attack service,
probably not the best. Giant ass

125
00:17:02,667 --> 00:17:06,958
antenna pointing at ‑‑ I think
it is obvious when you see a
giant antenna pointing to the

126
00:17:06,958 --> 00:17:12,958
passenger seat. I wasn't plugged
in. That was remote. Right
there. You could hack it. But

127
00:17:18,583 --> 00:17:24,583
probably not your first choice.
Next is the tire pressure
monitoring. All of the cars

128
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:32,750
today since I don't know when ‑‑
>> 2006. >> Thank you,
Mr. Egghead. Sensors in the tire

129
00:17:35,625 --> 00:17:41,625
communicate wirelessly with an
ten as that is processing that.
Hey, light comes on, you are

130
00:17:43,708 --> 00:17:51,000
getting a flat tire. In the
floor here is ‑‑ function box.
It has the antenna that receives

131
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:57,000
the signal from the sensors.
Anyway the point is here you
have maybe a little more range,

132
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:07,542
meters. There is going to be no
complexity in the date that
passed. All going to be like ‑‑

133
00:18:07,542 --> 00:18:12,792
>> It is a number, right, the
PSI of your tire. >> Not much
more than that. >> But

134
00:18:14,833 --> 00:18:20,833
researchers have communicated
with cars. There is something
going on! . Something. So, there

135
00:18:27,333 --> 00:18:34,542
is code running. Means probably
there is stuff there. Still we
do not think it is the best

136
00:18:34,542 --> 00:18:40,542
candidate for remote entry into
a vehicle. But way better . . .
almost everyone here is familiar

137
00:18:44,625 --> 00:18:50,625
with the park clicker that can
start ‑‑ sometimes start the
opening in as well. These again,

138
00:18:53,833 --> 00:19:01,708
broader range, talking more than
a couple of meters now. Again, a
con of it is probably the not

139
00:19:01,708 --> 00:19:08,583
much data. Probably going to
challenge the response, set a
specific value to open or start

140
00:19:08,583 --> 00:19:15,500
the car. Not really too much
else. On the other hand it is
usually connect the to a lot of

141
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:20,667
cool parts, locking, unlocking
the door, the engine. Ends up in
a cool place in the car.

142
00:19:20,667 --> 00:19:26,667
Probably more concerned with
theft from reproducing these
than code execution as the car

143
00:19:29,042 --> 00:19:35,333
flies by to do brakes or
steering. Probably a more viable
option. They are going to lock

144
00:19:35,333 --> 00:19:41,333
down on these car manufacturers
because they care about that.
Hard reverse‑engineer. The

145
00:19:46,667 --> 00:19:54,625
others we will get to in a
second they probably don't care
about. >> Exactly. One of the

146
00:19:54,625 --> 00:20:00,625
more familiar wireless protocols
is bluetooth. We think this is
probably one of the most ripe

147
00:20:03,625 --> 00:20:09,542
attack surfaces, right? Because
almost every car has it because
something for not using your

148
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:15,542
phone or demanding hands free. A
lot of times they support
streaming of audio and data. You

149
00:20:20,083 --> 00:20:26,500
can stream your music. It also
gets the ‑‑ I don't believe
there is a lot of code out there

150
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:32,667
that has not had a vulnerability
for audio parsing. For image
parsing. These are things people

151
00:20:32,667 --> 00:20:37,625
are familiar with. Especially
because they have been around a
while. They may be using old

152
00:20:37,625 --> 00:20:45,417
computer software with known
vulnerables. You have to get a
new bluetooth. We think this is

153
00:20:45,417 --> 00:20:51,417
one of the most viable attacks.
(Off microphone) Still
bluetooth, you have you to be

154
00:20:54,083 --> 00:21:00,083
around 10‑meters, 30 minutes.
You have to be able to see the
car basically or be close

155
00:21:03,917 --> 00:21:09,917
enough. There are some that you
don't have to be very close at
all. So, in your radio, you see

156
00:21:14,958 --> 00:21:20,958
the beautiful radio from my
cheap Ford Escape. It is
obviously getting FM signal or

157
00:21:25,458 --> 00:21:31,458
something with audio in it which
probably I can't imagine but
there is more data than that

158
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:46,000
coming 106.7. This is data that
is sent anything to the actual
you imagine people screwing

159
00:21:54,208 --> 00:22:00,208
up ‑‑ people tend to mess it up.
It is still pretty ‑‑ really,
the holy grail a lot for all of

160
00:22:09,875 --> 00:22:15,875
this is the gateway now for WiFi
cars as well. The range is
practically unlimited. If you

161
00:22:18,667 --> 00:22:23,750
are in range, you are in range.
They are designed to be used
everywhere. You want to hit an

162
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:29,750
SOS button or get this
connectivity. Or like Chris we
want to make dinner

163
00:22:34,208 --> 00:22:40,208
reservations. I have the car,
SLS button. It has a concierge.
Yo, I want dinner reservations.

164
00:22:43,083 --> 00:22:47,500
Sir is this an emergency. Yes I
want to make dinner
reservations. Hit the other

165
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:53,500
button. This is for an
emergency, people who are are
dying. Can you still take dinner

166
00:22:56,583 --> 00:23:02,583
reservations. Communicating data
across the world. >> This is
probably what most automobile

167
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:16,250
manufacturers worry about. The
use is pretty well unstood. (Off
microphone) Remotely as well.

168
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:28,542
The new thing I think that
becomes very concerning for us
is cars are now getting their

169
00:23:28,542 --> 00:23:35,250
own apps, getting web browser,
he we know we he can't write web
browsers or secure apps. I hope

170
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:41,250
to have a car with a web
browser. I don't know anything
about that. So, a large part of

171
00:23:49,417 --> 00:23:55,417
the security community is
already familiar with this. That
is why it ends up being pretty

172
00:23:59,042 --> 00:24:05,542
concerning. Imagine you brought
a device 2012 a piece of
hardware that had web browser on

173
00:24:05,542 --> 00:24:09,750
it, you couldn't update it.
Would you be worried? If there
is a problem it is really hear

174
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:15,750
to fix as well. Don't you
dare ‑‑ >> I am not. I have this
new Jeep that is cool. It can be

175
00:24:22,583 --> 00:24:28,583
a WiFi hotspot. It provides
Internet to ‑‑ but I actually,
look here it has open services.

176
00:24:37,708 --> 00:24:41,958
You can ‑‑ we are getting closer
to cars being more like software
which people like us ‑‑ most of

177
00:24:41,958 --> 00:24:46,833
us understand, hardware
problems. Bluetooth and radio
stuff is still . . . in the

178
00:24:46,833 --> 00:24:51,208
game. Getting in the car,
services we have been doing
years and years. >> Something

179
00:24:51,208 --> 00:24:58,750
wrong, doesn't work. Came
pre‑backdoor. >> Cyberphysical
as I explained before they

180
00:24:58,750 --> 00:25:04,750
control these last attributes. I
am not the biggest fan of cyber
anything. Well,. >> Yeah, you

181
00:25:18,542 --> 00:25:24,542
are. >> Well, one.
Cyber‑specific site. The thing
is people in the government

182
00:25:27,958 --> 00:25:33,000
sector, in the private and in
the public sector use these
terms. If we are going to get

183
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:39,958
along, communicate and work with
each other, we have to agree on
a set of verbiage. It seems like

184
00:25:39,958 --> 00:25:45,958
if we want to communicate with
them ‑‑ in the talk I am going
to use device this is your car

185
00:25:50,542 --> 00:25:56,542
that can control things in your
car. Here is an example of a
thing in your car ‑‑ >> Yeah.

186
00:25:58,583 --> 00:26:05,125
Now we are going to go
through ‑‑ very 250. Sweet car
has all of these awesome

187
00:26:05,125 --> 00:26:11,125
features. >> These cars have.
Not many of us realize they have
(noises/beeps). >> As you see, I

188
00:26:26,292 --> 00:26:30,042
am on a closed test track in
Pittsburgh. I am not ‑‑ >> I
thought that was a Hollywood

189
00:26:30,042 --> 00:26:35,500
testing. >> You can have
controls that you don't to press
from our experience like that,

190
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:41,500
send messages, sensor, compute
values, sends messages, brakes
work ‑‑ don't work ‑‑ >> A

191
00:26:44,458 --> 00:26:50,458
sensor hooked up to the brakes.
The brakes engage. The computer
knows what the sensor values are

192
00:26:55,083 --> 00:27:02,375
and communicates to the brakes.
How to do that. When to do that.
That means if you are on it, you

193
00:27:02,375 --> 00:27:08,375
can be ‑‑ >> Exactly. (audio
lost for captioner. >> It means
that it has tock network

194
00:27:22,292 --> 00:27:27,167
accessible to the head lamps.
You sort of reduce the
complexity of the network you

195
00:27:27,167 --> 00:27:32,125
can have. Because you can't
isolate those things you think
would be isolated. It may have a

196
00:27:32,125 --> 00:27:36,792
gateway in between but still . .
. intelligent cruise control
(noise behind a voice saying

197
00:27:36,792 --> 00:27:42,333
something once it sees the back
of the vehicle then the car
speeds back up again. >> The car

198
00:27:42,333 --> 00:27:46,417
pulls it ‑‑ slows itself down,
speeds itself up. Can happen in
communication, sensors, wires.

199
00:27:46,417 --> 00:27:52,250
Sending mess as to the car,
telling it to accelerate. That
might be something we can take

200
00:27:52,250 --> 00:27:58,250
advantage of (background noise
with a voice. Saying actively
stand back (inaudible). >>

201
00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:34,250
Describe it as Andy Capping
[phonetic] itself. >> You dated
yourself. >> I did. There is one

202
00:29:13,375 --> 00:29:19,375
old guy in the back nodding. >>
But, yeah, steering. It will be
a peace that is network

203
00:29:55,917 --> 00:30:00,375
accessible. These are useful
pieces; they keep drivers more
safe. >> There is a computer

204
00:30:00,375 --> 00:30:06,625
that can control the computer
while you are driving.
(background noise.) >> It is all

205
00:30:06,625 --> 00:30:13,333
of compared to this didn't have
sounds. You guys are getting
bonuses. >> Bonus. >> Collision

206
00:30:13,333 --> 00:30:20,042
prevention I am not going to
touch brake. Hear the beeping?
>> The brake, automatically, in

207
00:30:20,042 --> 00:30:26,292
that instance ‑‑ I guess the
radar knew it was cardboarded,
not a public transit vehicle.

208
00:30:26,292 --> 00:30:33,417
It's the same shot. >> No,
different angle. This is why our
hacking is (car sound in

209
00:30:33,417 --> 00:30:39,292
background) imagine what they
thought about this psychopath?
Drive it through 'em? Anyway it

210
00:30:39,292 --> 00:30:46,833
was a lot of fun. Way more
fun ‑‑ >> Testing is better than
connecting to the bug. >>

211
00:30:46,833 --> 00:30:53,875
Actually wanted to really crash,
thought it was going to stop one
of the boxes smashed underneath

212
00:30:53,875 --> 00:30:57,083
my car. >> Then. (Multiple
voices). >> A lot of the
coverage was really on the

213
00:30:57,083 --> 00:31:03,083
network architecture view. We
wanted to look at these three
separate piece toss a remote

214
00:32:14,333 --> 00:32:20,333
attack and look at cars and
decide if we were to get one,
which would we get which would

215
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:33,417
be most successful. We used the
term "hack ability" we used that
because it is less difficult

216
00:32:33,417 --> 00:32:39,417
than explaining it every time as
well. >> We can'ted a car that
would present the least possible

217
00:32:44,042 --> 00:32:48,958
problems to a remote attacker.
>> Exactly. Our thought was you
can buy a consumer reports

218
00:32:48,958 --> 00:32:54,958
magazine it will tell you the
cars with best safety features
and ratings. I think we should

219
00:32:58,208 --> 00:33:04,000
start doing it for cyber
security of vehicles. We want to
know what kind of security we

220
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:11,833
think these things have when we
buy them, so you can be an
informed consumer. My paper, if

221
00:33:11,833 --> 00:33:16,000
you really want to read it,
there is a lot of good stuff in
there. >> We have presented so

222
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:21,125
far about ten pages. We will do
the rest in the next four
minutes. >> Getting the

223
00:33:21,125 --> 00:33:27,125
information was hard a. Every
manufacturer is different. Go to
the mechanic's site. The wiring

224
00:33:30,833 --> 00:33:38,542
diagrams are different. We try
to correlate everything. It took
a long time. >> The reason we

225
00:33:38,542 --> 00:33:46,458
get the diagrams, go to the
mechanics' sites, the first
time, we downloading ‑‑ didn't

226
00:33:46,458 --> 00:33:53,250
try to hack it. No instructions
on how it is done. The sec time
we looked at the wiring

227
00:33:53,250 --> 00:33:59,250
diagrams. >> And decided we
should have used them long ago.
Hackers don't want to read

228
00:34:01,958 --> 00:34:07,958
instructions. You buy a new
table and for the next ten days
figure out how it is assembled.

229
00:34:12,333 --> 00:34:19,458
>> Hackers. Read the
instructions. Didn't actually do
the hack. >> The Internet is

230
00:34:19,458 --> 00:34:27,250
hard. Let's go shopping. A lot
of the websites ‑‑ >> Let's do
it now. The websites just

231
00:34:27,250 --> 00:34:33,375
weren't very useful. >> The
forums. >> I am trying to be
nice. >> You search things like

232
00:34:33,375 --> 00:34:40,958
cam. Nothing. I know you have a
cam bus. I have used it. If you
are not logged in, you don't get

233
00:34:40,958 --> 00:34:46,250
search results. If you are, you
get different once. This
constantly only works Tuesdays

234
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:51,167
and Wednesdays and bank
holidays. >> Looks like they are
working perfectly. Suck. Load up

235
00:34:51,167 --> 00:34:57,167
IE 6. Don't tell you to use a
different browser. I can't find
this. Dude, IE 7. You have to

236
00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:06,750
look at it. I am sure all of the
computers ‑‑ to hell and back
be. >> Huge collaboration

237
00:35:10,917 --> 00:35:16,917
between the NFA and automotive
manufacturers. >> Exactly. >> It
took time. I don't want to

238
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:27,000
say ‑‑ this is the boring part,
remote survey. We tried to make
it easy. If you get the paper

239
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:33,000
you will get these icons. These
things are kind of important
pieces, the pieces bee he want

240
00:35:36,667 --> 00:35:42,667
to research and are concerned
with. All of the ‑‑ cyber
physical things. Put them on the

241
00:35:45,833 --> 00:35:52,708
diagram. We are going to fly
through the diagrams. There is
not much to say. You want to

242
00:35:52,708 --> 00:35:58,750
read the paper, look at them.
Note there is a bunch of
different arc about tech tours.

243
00:35:58,750 --> 00:36:05,125
I thought most of the cars would
be ‑‑ had all of the Internet
stuff somewhere then the

244
00:36:05,125 --> 00:36:11,000
important other stuff somewhere,
other stuff other places,
connected by a gateway. That is

245
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:18,500
how they are set up. Obviously,
this is not the case. You have a
new Accord, for example, or

246
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:24,500
audionav unit connected to both
cam buses. Things like that are
problematic for us. If you hack

247
00:36:28,125 --> 00:36:35,375
bluetooth you are on a device
not only on your power train bus
but on your secondary cam bus as

248
00:36:35,375 --> 00:36:41,375
well. >> The last two cars is
way easy, presents less
obstacles. In the three steps

249
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:51,083
there is no step two. >> Remote,
figure out how to make the
brakes. >> Exactly. You have

250
00:36:51,083 --> 00:36:57,083
almost everything on one cam
bongs gateway that communicates
with braking and steering.

251
00:36:59,958 --> 00:37:06,375
Having stuff on one bus
especially that contains the
wireless connectivity features

252
00:37:06,375 --> 00:37:12,375
is something that we probably
think can be used to easily
achieve hacking into the car. >>

253
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,125
Because there happens to be a
gatewar between the radio and
brakes does not mean you can't

254
00:37:18,125 --> 00:37:24,125
send messages it will make it
harder. The academics were able
to go from a part of the car's

255
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:38,125
network to wherever the brakes
and stuff were by reprogramming
the gateway. It is possible you

256
00:37:38,125 --> 00:37:43,750
can get by the gateways. >> They
are not stopping everything. We
have to look at it. >> Something

257
00:37:43,750 --> 00:37:49,625
else you have to look like. In
the Escape there are two
networks, one where the P PMS

258
00:37:49,625 --> 00:37:55,625
and the brakes [phonetic]. On
not sure how to get from the
PPMS to the brakes. Hard to

259
00:38:01,292 --> 00:38:07,292
tell. Cars went through
evolution. Here is a 2010 and
2006. Each car taking the place

260
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:16,500
of the other. Went from the flat
pan networks to a more segmented
one they added more features and

261
00:38:21,333 --> 00:38:27,375
functionality. People say I am
going to go buy that. >> I buy
the new car. Has all of the

262
00:38:27,375 --> 00:38:34,917
safety features of those things
are going to safe your ass more
than be . . . >> That thing

263
00:38:34,917 --> 00:38:40,917
stops itself. I can drive and
tweet all the time. All day. >>
Why wouldn't you. >> Drive and

264
00:38:45,167 --> 00:38:51,167
tweet. Get a latte. Don't know
if we have time to do this. This
carry ended up getting most

265
00:38:54,917 --> 00:39:01,458
hackable. There are two
different cam buses, all a of
the interesting things are

266
00:39:01,458 --> 00:39:05,875
there. But there is the radio
which has almost all of the
wireless stuff. I lives on both

267
00:39:05,875 --> 00:39:11,875
of those networks. Essentially
it does not look like a flat
network. But it is completely

268
00:39:14,083 --> 00:39:21,667
flat. Everything you care about.
While the Dodge is the same way
it does not have cyber specific

269
00:39:21,667 --> 00:39:28,292
things even though the network
architecture is the same. The
car is made by the same parent

270
00:39:28,292 --> 00:39:34,000
company but network line is
different. The big difference is
the radio is only on the

271
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:41,208
privileged network not the one
that has the brakes. Even though
you think they are both the same

272
00:39:41,208 --> 00:39:48,125
parent company they would be the
exactly the same douse not end
up the same. It is the same as

273
00:39:48,125 --> 00:39:56,042
300, less cyber specific
features. Goes fast. >> I wanted
that to be the most hackable to

274
00:39:56,042 --> 00:40:03,917
justify buying it. >> SC
[phonetic] segmented cam but
interesting stuff connected to

275
00:40:03,917 --> 00:40:09,917
both. Old Ford Fusion not much
in it. New one, a lot in it.
These things go through an

276
00:40:14,833 --> 00:40:29,792
evolution. BMW as well. >> The
cars most applicable have the
most features. >> That does not

277
00:40:29,792 --> 00:40:37,792
mean that we want cars with less
features. We want cars with all
sorts of radical features. But

278
00:40:37,792 --> 00:40:45,917
design ‑‑ exactly. You can see
BMW similar throughout. Most
cars except the concept car is

279
00:40:45,917 --> 00:40:51,750
crazy. >> Even that is
segmented. >> Yes. Range Rover
very segmented. Has not changed

280
00:40:51,750 --> 00:40:55,333
all that much in the evolution
of their vehicles where you just
have ‑‑ ended up using

281
00:40:55,333 --> 00:41:03,500
technology, still enjoy it, have
suppliers that use it. It
happens a lot. Sometimes they

282
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:09,875
don't change at all a. 2014
Prius basically identical to the
2010. At one point you had this

283
00:41:09,875 --> 00:41:18,458
massive shift in architecture.
Again more features more
complexity. They re‑architect

284
00:41:18,458 --> 00:41:27,667
how these things are done. We
have been told to eliminate all
of our chatter ‑‑ >> Right. What

285
00:41:27,667 --> 00:41:38,292
about . . . range Rovers. >>
Bentleys. All of the cars we did
not look at. More completion.

286
00:41:38,292 --> 00:41:53,583
Manufacturers have different
designs for different cars. We
have been saying for almost two

287
00:41:53,583 --> 00:41:56,000
years: Almost every car had
something different about it. >>
Right. >> This is the thing that

288
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,708
made hacking a car hard. Even if
you know everything about a car
it does not generalize to other

289
00:41:58,708 --> 00:42:17,000
cars. Which is why we do this
talk. Last year, we knew
something about two cars. We

290
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:25,083
know a Lot little about all of
the cars but not much about all
of them. >> Holy shit, patching

291
00:42:25,083 --> 00:42:29,125
is a huge disaster is one of the
things we found. Get patch or
update, it is easy, almost

292
00:42:29,125 --> 00:42:34,583
automatic. Right now you with a
problem in the car they send you
a letter, tell you to go to a

293
00:42:34,583 --> 00:42:41,042
mechanic shop to get the car
fixed. What happens when you
sell the car? Right now there is

294
00:42:41,042 --> 00:42:44,417
this huge issue with patching.
If something comes out, there is
no good way to fix it. >> When I

295
00:42:44,417 --> 00:42:48,917
get a recall notice ‑‑ I rip it
up. >> I still get recall
notices for the Prius and Ford

296
00:42:48,917 --> 00:42:55,375
escape. >> That is cars are
fine. >> Those cars are fine.
They are dead. Securing an

297
00:42:55,375 --> 00:43:05,292
automobile is important to us.
End points. People are doing
right now. Maybe you could

298
00:43:05,292 --> 00:43:11,583
segment cam message injection.
The thing with the bluetooth
does that have to write messages

299
00:43:11,583 --> 00:43:19,458
on the bus? Probably not. I am
not an automotive architect.
But, you know ‑‑ >> We can tell

300
00:43:19,458 --> 00:43:25,417
manufacturers to focus on
stopping the remote attacks.
That is one of the three steps.

301
00:43:25,417 --> 00:43:32,167
We want to make all three
steps ‑‑ >> Live and learn. It
is kind of turning back a clock.

302
00:43:32,167 --> 00:43:40,458
The same a steps we went through
in the late '90's and early ops
same things happen in cars.

303
00:43:40,458 --> 00:43:47,583
Crypto not going to work. >>
Feel sorry the people who are
working. They are going to start

304
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:55,125
crying if they don't see this.
>> From our perspective, adds a
layer of complexity for hackers.

305
00:43:55,125 --> 00:44:04,167
What didn't we talk about? That
is used almost ridiculously in
everyone's environment is

306
00:44:04,167 --> 00:44:13,667
prevention. This is the
hackolator 3000. We came up with
these algorithms. >> You did. >>

307
00:44:13,667 --> 00:44:21,792
I architected it. >> You were
there. >> I was present. So
that's something. Basically,

308
00:44:21,792 --> 00:44:29,208
press a button, learn how the
car works. If anything is ‑‑
stadard movement. We saw how

309
00:44:29,208 --> 00:44:32,958
attacks work. No way to
objfuscate them. The networks
are simple. Then stop the

310
00:44:32,958 --> 00:44:44,500
attack. We have in thing here.
>> Car networks are different
from Internet. The main thing.

311
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:48,542
Network is completely
predictable on computers. Things
like attacks stand out. Go!

312
00:44:48,542 --> 00:45:02,250
(Multiple voices). >>
(background noise) brakes stop.
Now I am going to turn on . . .

313
00:45:02,250 --> 00:45:18,042
I would say something is wrong.
Safe from attack. Safely drive
the vehicle. >> This only took a

314
00:45:18,042 --> 00:45:45,667
few seconds to learn how a car
works. If there is an attack
disabling the brakes, you can

315
00:45:45,667 --> 00:46:05,042
stop it before it is happening.
We often short the cam bus out.
Nothing would work but I am sure

316
00:46:05,042 --> 00:46:11,792
you can do something else. >>
Like anything is anomalous, all
of the attacks we know ‑‑ >> You

317
00:46:11,792 --> 00:46:20,833
can plug this into any car. As
long as you can get a nice
sample ‑‑ >> That is it. Thanks.

318
00:46:20,833 --> 00:46:26,208
Wait. There is one more thing.
Oh, I fooled ya. >> Suckers! >>
So we are going to have some

319
00:46:26,208 --> 00:46:44,167
bugs dropped now. Two method os
to ‑‑ jeep, dodge SRT. >> That
is a model skateboard. >> Here

320
00:46:44,167 --> 00:46:52,417
is how you can jail‑break your
car. The way that updates work
is ‑‑ for these vehicles is get

321
00:46:52,417 --> 00:47:01,833
a USB stick, download iso valve
[phonetic] the car. (Off
microphone) It checks it against

322
00:47:01,833 --> 00:47:21,375
the encryptor path if that is
cool it updates your file. So I
had an idea: I will wait until

323
00:47:21,375 --> 00:47:25,375
it checks for ‑‑ runs through
and verifies. Then I will switch
out the USB switch see if that

324
00:47:25,375 --> 00:47:35,792
works. It is cool, says it
installed it. Ungh. Did not
work. The stick. Says it is

325
00:47:35,792 --> 00:47:41,500
not ‑‑ you are not going to
change up on me. They thought
about it. Well done, Chrysler.

326
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:51,792
They didn't think about this I
go further. Say yes, I would
like to install this software.

327
00:47:51,792 --> 00:48:04,292
(noise in background. The noise
you are camping. >> That is the
Bronx. >> As soon as it

328
00:48:04,292 --> 00:48:20,875
restarts, I pull the stick, now
the car is in a bit of a pickle.
It has written values. Doesn't

329
00:48:20,875 --> 00:48:26,583
start in upgrade mode what it is
going to do now instead of fully
rejecting me, in a moment it is

330
00:48:26,583 --> 00:48:32,833
going to beg me for ‑‑ >> You
are going to put the same one
that was in there? >> No ‑‑ fair

331
00:48:32,833 --> 00:48:40,375
enough ‑‑ I am going to stick
the stick in there. Now it is
going to check. The code that

332
00:48:40,375 --> 00:48:47,708
does the check is from the USB
stick. I am going to leave off
that part. >> Can you

333
00:48:47,708 --> 00:48:55,542
fast‑forward here a bit. It says
insert your stick. >> So bad. >>
Anyway, you can fast‑forward to

334
00:48:55,542 --> 00:49:00,667
the end ‑‑ you will see that ‑‑
never mind. You ruined it. Jail
break method two, the preferred

335
00:49:00,667 --> 00:49:12,042
method for hackers. Take the
upgrade file, reverse it. There
are some ‑‑ in there. In charm

336
00:49:12,042 --> 00:49:21,833
of the check. There is an
awesome code snippet there. It
opens the file, reads 128 bites

337
00:49:21,833 --> 00:49:32,250
into the file, reads one byte.
If it is a capital F ‑‑ be if it
is ‑‑ awesome data. Skip. I am

338
00:49:32,250 --> 00:49:39,667
going to reverse‑engineer. Yeah.
>> I think most people can do
that ‑‑ >> I found it! Found it.

339
00:49:39,667 --> 00:49:47,667
Entered capital a letter F and
although and behold it totally
works. Then I can do things ‑‑

340
00:49:47,667 --> 00:49:59,958
it already has SSH on it. Put
that on, enter my password. >>
What would you do? Also.

341
00:49:59,958 --> 00:50:13,875
(Applause) >> If I had my car, I
would do this what would you all
do? >> When you start your car .

342
00:50:13,875 --> 00:00:00,000
. . (sound of car starting). >>
Thanks a lot. (Applause)
