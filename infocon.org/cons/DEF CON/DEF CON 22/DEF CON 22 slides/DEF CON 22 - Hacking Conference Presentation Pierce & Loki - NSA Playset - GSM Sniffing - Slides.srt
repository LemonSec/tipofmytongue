1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,125
>>All right. So wow further ado,
we have Loki presented on GSM
this morning or this afternoon,

2
00:00:06,125 --> 00:00:12,125
sorry. And  ‑ ‑ pierce. I'm
sorry. I missed that. So without
further ado, I'm going to let

3
00:00:17,208 --> 00:00:23,208
the fine gentlemen get on with
this. Enjoy. [ Applause ] >>
Left and  ‑ ‑ left and right.

4
00:00:31,875 --> 00:00:37,750
Okay. GSM, welcome to our talk.
We are going to talk about NSA
today, we have fun GSM and going

5
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:43,750
to talk about. My name is dean
pierce. This is my fourth Def
Con talk. I have been attending

6
00:00:47,125 --> 00:00:53,917
Def Con since Def Con 10. I am
information security
professional and I work in the

7
00:00:53,917 --> 00:00:59,125
field of product security, which
is great. It is way cooler than
testing you get to see cool

8
00:00:59,125 --> 00:01:03,417
shit. So. It is good stuff. It
should be a  career path people
look into. Also for some reason

9
00:01:03,417 --> 00:01:09,417
when I get a  paper for Def Con
is wireless stuff. All of my
nonwireless talks are excepted.

10
00:01:21,458 --> 00:01:27,458
That's about me. >> Hey, I'm
Loki. Yeah. This is my first
time talking at Def Con. [

11
00:01:33,167 --> 00:01:39,167
Applause ] So I've been doing
stuff for  ‑ ‑ secure stuff for
12 years. Mostly analytic‑ type

12
00:01:50,333 --> 00:01:57,333
stuff. They are calling the big
data now which bothers me. And
pretty much every role I have

13
00:01:57,333 --> 00:02:03,958
ever been in, I had to do some
sort of security stuff. I like
seeing problems that is also a 

14
00:02:03,958 --> 00:02:09,958
interest of me. And the GSM
stuff for the past few years I
had a  heavy interest in and

15
00:02:12,042 --> 00:02:18,042
kept playing with it. That's
about it for me. So let's see.
So GSM, most of you guys are

16
00:02:21,667 --> 00:02:27,000
probably familiar with it, is
the most widely used cellular
system in the world. And right

17
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:33,000
now  ‑ ‑ what? There's, right?
7  billion, I think, as of 2013.
People worldwide using it. Going

18
00:02:40,292 --> 00:02:46,625
off of the GSM association it is
available in more than 219
countries, market share more

19
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:54,083
than 9%. All  ‑ ‑ 90%. All of
that fun stuff, and also the
legacy network for most of the

20
00:02:54,083 --> 00:03:00,083
other technologies used today,
with the exception of CDMA. That
means LT built on top of the GSM

21
00:03:04,583 --> 00:03:11,417
stuff. Right now there, if you
make a  voice call that is
probably going on classic GSM.

22
00:03:11,417 --> 00:03:17,583
Whereas, essentially, with LTE
we expect to see that go over
data traffic, at some point it

23
00:03:17,583 --> 00:03:23,583
will be probably be more
difficult to play with. Hold on,
slides. One of the things that

24
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:34,375
was interesting about the GSM
stuff was that it's, it was  ‑ ‑
the first of seriously consider

25
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:42,500
any  form of security with both 
‑ ‑ stuff with the  ‑ ‑ beans
instead of any sort of  ‑ ‑ um,

26
00:03:46,375 --> 00:03:52,375
persistent mobile identity. It
somewhat helped your usage of it
from just an eavesdropper

27
00:03:54,833 --> 00:04:00,833
perspective. And it also used A5
encryption, which there is A5/1
and A5/2 are the standards, and

28
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:09,750
unfortunately, what was rolled
out for most of the world was a 
slightly broken version of it,

29
00:04:12,417 --> 00:04:17,833
even though at this point most
of them have gone to somewhat
more secure, but still breakable

30
00:04:17,833 --> 00:04:23,833
A5/1. There is A53. But as far
as I'm aware there is no
rollouts of it. That one is also

31
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:33,333
know, nobody has breaks for it
at this point. So I'm out of
sync with my slides. Sorry about

32
00:04:40,083 --> 00:04:46,083
that. This short history lesson
in the 199's, the first attack
on A5 was proposed on June  17,

33
00:04:53,250 --> 00:05:00,500
1994, there was a  message
posted to UK telecom group and
it, he described potential

34
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:07,042
attacks and also the first
publication of open A5 site.
People had idea what was it, but

35
00:05:07,042 --> 00:05:13,042
nobody published code that may
represents what it looks like
internally. Yeah, that was over

36
00:05:18,292 --> 00:05:24,292
20 years ago. In, we're, still
using the same cipher today. In
'97, um, at  ‑ ‑ I can never

37
00:05:29,958 --> 00:05:35,958
pronounce his name. It is Jovon,
presented  ‑ ‑ cryptanalysis,
and presented a  potential time

38
00:05:41,917 --> 00:05:47,917
memory trade‑ off attack which
was sort of the basis for a lot
of the further attacks that

39
00:05:55,458 --> 00:06:01,458
happened. So in 2000, um, at the
seventh international workshop
on software encryption, three

40
00:06:07,375 --> 00:06:13,375
guys presented a  ‑ ‑ um, paper
on realtime cryptanalysis  ‑ ‑
of A51, and than that one, that

41
00:06:18,708 --> 00:06:24,708
was the first attack to
theoretically allow you to see
decrypted traffic in realtime.

42
00:06:29,917 --> 00:06:35,917
Also, in 2000, two other people
went ahead and invented
essentially the same idea with a

43
00:06:41,167 --> 00:06:46,625
slightly different time memory
trade‑ off technique. And so
both of them theoretically

44
00:06:46,625 --> 00:06:52,625
allowed attacks on A5 with plain
text. But they were not really
practical. So then 2003 came

45
00:06:57,292 --> 00:07:03,292
along and there was a  paper
related in cipher text only
cryptanalysis. And it was a time

46
00:07:05,542 --> 00:07:11,625
only memory trade‑ off attack.
It was practical, but it
requires a  ridiculous large

47
00:07:11,625 --> 00:07:17,625
computation phase. I believe it
was in the order of 32
terabytes, which was not

48
00:07:20,167 --> 00:07:26,167
practical at all. And then in
2006 the full version of the
paper was related. 2003 was

49
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:35,000
significantly cut on what they
actually talked about. In that
they went ahead and gave a lot

50
00:07:39,917 --> 00:07:45,917
more information that allowed
you to  ‑ ‑ basically come up
with very short plain text. Up

51
00:07:50,208 --> 00:07:56,208
until then, um, know five
minutes of plain text would be
required, again, impractical. So

52
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:06,750
2007 COPACOBANA came along. In
that one, COPACOBANA was a 
hardware project it stands for

53
00:08:13,083 --> 00:08:20,458
cost optimized parallel
codebreaker. And it was
implemented for running most

54
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:25,875
algorithms but specifically for
cryptanalysis. It was
commercially available

55
00:08:25,875 --> 00:08:31,875
eventually, and could be used
for A5/1 and A5/2 and other
things, including GSM. It went

56
00:08:34,292 --> 00:08:40,292
and ahead enabled force attacks
from GSM without look up tables.
However, this was still not

57
00:08:45,417 --> 00:08:51,125
realtime. That was actually done
as a  research project that
eventually turned into a 

58
00:08:51,125 --> 00:08:57,125
commercial solution. Yeah. I
wanted to jump in with 2007,
because  ‑ ‑ this is also 2007 I

59
00:09:00,667 --> 00:09:06,667
attended torcon and I saw a 
really awesome presentation on
using FPGAs and USRPs with crack

60
00:09:09,792 --> 00:09:15,792
phone calls for $30, and it was
amazing. I thought it would be
cool if somebody bundled it

61
00:09:19,208 --> 00:09:24,625
together and sold it on eBay.
That stuff is hard to do. They
didn't release information on

62
00:09:24,625 --> 00:09:30,625
how to do it. That was my first
thought of the NAS playset
bundle concept. It has taken a

63
00:09:33,333 --> 00:09:39,333
long time to actually do stuff.
Let's see, 2008. 2008 was
actually when carry talked about

64
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:54,125
generating tables and the, the
tables got generated but a lot
of the tools were, a lot of

65
00:09:56,125 --> 00:10:01,042
tools didn't get released and a
lot of the tables didn't get
released. A lot of stuff didn't

66
00:10:01,042 --> 00:10:07,042
happen. It was very much like a 
theoretical thing at that point.
Which leads to 2009. Let's see.

67
00:10:13,625 --> 00:10:19,625
So in 2009, that's when you have
the, there's a  talk at black
hat where they tried to kickoff

68
00:10:22,458 --> 00:10:28,792
the A5/1 project. So this was a 
global distributed effort where
everybody who had, like fast

69
00:10:28,792 --> 00:10:35,542
video cards could team up
together and everyone was going
to generate the A5/1 tables once

70
00:10:35,542 --> 00:10:41,750
and for all. It was going to be
great. Also, it is really fun to
read the mailing list, too. If

71
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:48,208
you go back and look at the A5/1
mailing list at this point. You
have people jumping in saying I

72
00:10:48,208 --> 00:10:53,250
got this card it is not
optimized. Everyone doing their
own thing and turning a  table

73
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:58,125
here and there. This one guy
jumps on, hey I wrote this tool
called cracking that uses the

74
00:10:58,125 --> 00:11:05,417
table and brute force. That is
great and still used today. And
then the tables got released.

75
00:11:05,417 --> 00:11:11,417
So  ‑ ‑ let's see. How do I get
back? Over here? Yeah. Good. So
2010 was Carson speaking at

76
00:11:22,917 --> 00:11:30,125
black hat. Again, and demoing,
demoing the stuff and  ‑ ‑
actually, they replaced air pro,

77
00:11:30,125 --> 00:11:36,125
which is great, air pro uses the
USRP to get the raw GSM and then
you can figure out some, some

78
00:11:42,875 --> 00:11:47,083
like the text stuff and then use
that and crack it with the
cracking tools and the A5/1

79
00:11:47,083 --> 00:11:53,083
tables released and then decrypt
the traffic. He showed this on
the black hat stage. It was

80
00:11:55,500 --> 00:12:01,500
great. Everyone applauded it was
wonderful. They also talk about
in 2010, actually using the

81
00:12:04,375 --> 00:12:09,583
Motorola phones to start
sniffing stuff. Which is great,
they are a  heck of a lot

82
00:12:09,583 --> 00:12:16,250
cheaper than the USRPs that are
a  couple of thousand dollars
with the accessories. And the

83
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:22,250
phones are silly phones that you
can get at any store. So that
was great. At the end of 2010.

84
00:12:27,417 --> 00:12:31,250
Carson did a  talk at CCC and
taking about broadband GSM and
used four different phones and

85
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:37,708
then monitored all frequencies
and did a  full range of
sniffing everything with the

86
00:12:37,708 --> 00:12:42,625
phones. It was good. So nothing
really happened. Wait. Nothing
really happened in 2011. GSM

87
00:12:42,625 --> 00:12:46,500
security was broken. It was
done. We're good. Everybody is
going get fixed now. Right? So,

88
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:52,500
unfortunately that didn't really
happen, but  ‑ ‑ in 2012, we had
this great thing, anyone here

89
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:13,250
familiar with the real tech SDR
bundles? These things are great.
They started selling and people

90
00:13:15,458 --> 00:13:21,667
quickly realized, these are T.V.
tuners sold everywhere under
different brand names. People

91
00:13:21,667 --> 00:13:27,750
realized they could twittal a 
couple of bits here at whatever
frequency and dump traffic.

92
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:34,375
Overnight the software defined
radio computer exploded. Every
one with $20  in their pocket 

93
00:13:34,375 --> 00:13:40,500
could go buy this little
receiver and just start sniffing
traffic and it worked with all

94
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:46,500
the GSM radios and the tools the
more academic things. In 2013, I
was able to take a  radio class.

95
00:14:21,125 --> 00:14:27,125
It was a great experience, and I
told them my weird of
identifying of packaging

96
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:37,667
everybody together and trying to
get it to work and get it out
there as much as possible. He

97
00:14:37,667 --> 00:14:44,750
thought it was really cool. And
we talked about it a  bit. And
then at the end of 2013 was when

98
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:50,750
the ANT catalog was released.
Who remembers the ANT catalog?
Anyone. That was interesting

99
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:59,083
stuff from NSA, what weird toys
that they sell and different
parts of the intelligence

100
00:14:59,083 --> 00:15:05,083
community. Great stuff. Anyway,
that brings us up to 2014. What
was that? Okay. Well  ‑ ‑ it is 

101
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:24,750
‑ ‑ there. Yeah. So  ‑ ‑ in
2014. This was the birth of the
NSA playset here. It was great.

102
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:30,750
We, after the ANT catalog came
out Mike was like remember that
crazy playset idea, like  ‑ ‑

103
00:15:35,542 --> 00:15:39,833
like, he thought of the stuff
with the reflectors and things,
that was cool. He wants to make

104
00:15:39,833 --> 00:15:46,917
a  bunch of these things. That
would be rad to pull things
together and actually see how

105
00:15:46,917 --> 00:15:53,625
much could be built. That was
really exciting. I talked to Joe
and a bunch of other people and

106
00:15:53,625 --> 00:15:59,500
like other weird things we could
do and things that looked like
they were pretty feasible. And

107
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:06,750
so  ‑ ‑ yeah. Everything started
to come together. Mike gave the
first talk at hack in the box in

108
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:14,167
Amsterdam. And we tried to
recruit a  few people. Our
mailing list is growing and

109
00:16:14,167 --> 00:16:22,083
growing. 150 members of the
mailing list right now. That's
pretty great. What we really

110
00:16:22,083 --> 00:16:27,792
tried to focus on with the
playset stuff is making it as
easy as possible to use so that

111
00:16:27,792 --> 00:16:34,500
it is just as  ‑ ‑ accessible as
possible. And then also reducing
the cost and making it more

112
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:41,208
accessible. As many people can
play with it as possible. The
motto I have been saying over

113
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:47,958
and over, if a  10‑ year‑ old
can't do it, it doesn't count.
So because it  ‑ ‑ things don't

114
00:16:47,958 --> 00:16:54,375
really get fixed until they are
actually extremely accessible.
That's kind of a  bummer.

115
00:16:54,375 --> 00:17:00,792
Because eve one all of the great
work that Carson and people did,
I mean, the  ‑ ‑ we're still

116
00:17:00,792 --> 00:17:06,792
using a lot of the like crazy
terrible cryptography, and the
fixes Carson has recommended to

117
00:17:06,792 --> 00:17:13,833
the carriers have not been
implemented. So that's kind of
a  bummer. >>So  ‑ ‑ with the,

118
00:17:13,833 --> 00:17:19,833
with the NSA playset, it is
actually sort of three separate
things. And I'll go over one of

119
00:17:28,125 --> 00:17:35,125
them and dean will go over the
other two. In general, what we
have done so far with NSA

120
00:17:35,125 --> 00:17:41,125
playset and GSM. We have air
probe working with essentially
after major SDR out there,

121
00:17:44,333 --> 00:17:50,333
through the asthma SDR. That
basically gives us a  single
interface that supports the

122
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:59,750
hacker, the RTL, SDR, the USRP.
Without having to worry about
from our code what the back end

123
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:09,667
is, what our signal source is.
We've improved the signal
tracking a  bit. There was a lot

124
00:18:09,667 --> 00:18:15,667
of problem with  ‑ ‑ drift,
especially with the cheaper RT
SDRs. So frequency code has been

125
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:24,250
improved a  bit. The cracking
A5/1 tables and indexes have
gone ahead and been put on a 

126
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:35,375
single external USB3 hard drive.
It's basically plug‑ and‑ play
with the tracking program on any

127
00:18:37,625 --> 00:18:45,375
Linux machine at this point. It
also works on OS X in some
cases. And also an environment

128
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:51,375
based upon limits that has been
upgraded with  ‑ ‑ the ah, new
radio 3.7 and a bunch of GSM‑

129
00:18:57,292 --> 00:19:03,292
specific tools. Oh, and we also
imported the air probe GSM to
work with 3.7. So the bootable

130
00:19:10,125 --> 00:19:15,500
environment, you know, of
course, it comes with every
challenge with it, and, of

131
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:20,500
course, comes with the improved
GSM receiver, it comes with,
which is what you use to

132
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:27,208
actually listen for traffic.
CCCH scan, for the codes, it
comes with binaries and various

133
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:33,208
other tools to calibrate and
stuff like that. So the first of
the NSA playset GSM tool. This

134
00:19:42,417 --> 00:19:48,417
one is not complete yet. It is
not ready to be released is
twilight vegetable. It a  system

135
00:19:50,792 --> 00:19:57,458
that basically you turn on your
machine and eventually you're
going to start getting dumps of

136
00:19:57,458 --> 00:20:05,292
all of the voice messages or all
of the voice traffic and SMS
traffic that is within range for

137
00:20:05,292 --> 00:20:11,292
you. The sources are basically
any of the SDR supported by
asthma SDR as well as the DB and

138
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:17,500
Samsung gallery devices. The BB
is any phone and then the
Samsung galaxy devices use

139
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:19,750
something like X gold that uses
the debugging feature in the
devices for traffic. Basically

140
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:21,750
twilight vegetables detect the
sending and dumping traffic to
the essential service. That

141
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:24,500
essential services handing all
of the description and stuff
like that. It is necessary as

142
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:27,333
well as to decoding data. Let's
see, so basic overview of the
system. You have the capture

143
00:20:27,333 --> 00:20:29,333
clients the SDRs and BBs. Those
just send the data to the
central dispatcher, which

144
00:20:29,333 --> 00:20:31,333
basically consists of database
server that we store stuff like
session keys, mapping and a 

145
00:20:31,333 --> 00:20:33,333
bunch of custom software that is
written around the database and
send requests  out to run

146
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:35,333
statistical analysis on the
encrypted data to detect, you
know, what type of plain text we

147
00:20:35,333 --> 00:20:37,333
think it is. And then, of
course, kraken itself, which is
executable index files and

148
00:20:37,333 --> 00:20:40,583
tables. With the potential to
have that load balance so that
there's, so that kraken

149
00:20:40,583 --> 00:20:46,292
definitely has a  speed limit.
You can go ahead and get around
that using multiple instances.

150
00:20:46,292 --> 00:20:51,917
So the UM interface capture
device is basically one of these
would  ‑ ‑ we have it mostly,

151
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:58,500
but one of these is written for
each type of device, one for the
DSR. One for gold, and one for

152
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:01,792
DB. If a  new UM interface that
is the radio side of things
capture device comes out, it

153
00:21:01,792 --> 00:21:03,792
should be able to be added
relatively simply either by
writing the writer or hopefully

154
00:21:03,792 --> 00:21:05,833
DR supports it. So each of these
is responsible for listening one
or more, or A RSD N, the radio

155
00:21:05,833 --> 00:21:07,833
frequency channel numbers. Think
of them as frequencies there is
a map between the member and a

156
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:11,792
given frequency and the GSM
band. And what it does it goes
ahead and detects any what are

157
00:21:11,792 --> 00:21:14,583
called immediate channel
assignment messages. These
basically say, hey I need you to

158
00:21:14,583 --> 00:21:18,250
switch to a  new channel and
most likely going to send you
encrypted data. So when the

159
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:21,917
phone receives this, it switches
that new channel and the first
message that is usually sent is

160
00:21:21,917 --> 00:21:26,208
a  crypto message we know what
that looks like. It is a known
plain text. We can use it with

161
00:21:26,208 --> 00:21:30,542
kraken to go ahead and crack the
rest of the traffic. So when it
sees that channel assignment

162
00:21:30,542 --> 00:21:34,208
message it goes ahead and starts
capturing all of the data on
that channel. Once that channel

163
00:21:34,208 --> 00:21:36,833
is released or that channel is
reassigned, sometimes the
channel release messages

164
00:21:36,833 --> 00:21:41,458
themselves are encrypted, we
cannot detect that until we
crack it. It goes ahead and ends

165
00:21:41,458 --> 00:21:47,458
the capture file  ‑ ‑ sorry  ‑ ‑
ends the capture file and
submits it to the central

166
00:21:52,042 --> 00:21:58,042
dispatcher. What it submits is
the error FCN. The temporary
mobile subscriber identify, the

167
00:22:58,333 --> 00:23:04,333
network information, that is
your mobile country code and
mobile network code, cell ID and

168
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:13,000
signal‑ to‑ noise ratio. Which
is important to tell if a 
packet is likely to have

169
00:23:15,042 --> 00:23:17,792
corrupted data tin or not. And
then as well it sends the  ‑ ‑
actual channel data that it has

170
00:23:17,792 --> 00:23:19,792
captured. So when the submits
that to the central dispatcher 
‑ ‑ where's the next slide? The

171
00:23:19,792 --> 00:23:21,792
central dispatcher goes ahead
and  ‑ ‑ um, writes multiple
functions. Basically it takes it

172
00:23:21,792 --> 00:23:23,792
in, puts it in a file store,
enters the submitted data into
a  database linking to the file,

173
00:23:23,792 --> 00:23:25,792
the file in the file store, and
then runs statistical analysis
on the packets to see which one

174
00:23:25,792 --> 00:23:27,792
we know are plain text. Some of
that is very simple. This is if
first packet. We know it is

175
00:23:27,792 --> 00:23:29,792
a crypto packet. Some of that is
a  ‑ ‑ um, for instance,
a system information 5 message,

176
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:31,792
which we can, by looking at the
plain text version of it, we
know what the crypto version of

177
00:23:31,792 --> 00:23:37,792
it and detect whether or not it
send a  message with high
likelihood based upon comparison

178
00:23:57,958 --> 00:24:02,958
with the rest of the encrypted
messages in a  sense. So it also
goes ahead and stores any

179
00:24:02,958 --> 00:24:07,667
cracked keys that it gets back
from crack one the associated
keys. Keys are used, reused for

180
00:24:07,667 --> 00:24:12,125
a  given session. So we're able
to go ahead and immediately
encrypt any data using that

181
00:24:12,125 --> 00:24:17,917
"TMZ" in the future. Then also
want it gets back a  key and it
is able to decrypt the data, it

182
00:24:17,917 --> 00:24:22,083
goes ahead and parses through
looking for SMS and voice
messages. And then writes them

183
00:24:22,083 --> 00:24:27,625
out to disk for you. With an
associated MZ if it is detected
in MZs. They are not sent very

184
00:24:27,625 --> 00:24:32,083
often. So that's sort of the
glue that holds everything
together. The next part of that

185
00:24:32,083 --> 00:24:38,458
is kraken, which we will cover
more later. But kraken  ‑ ‑ when
it  ‑ ‑ it is able to be run in

186
00:24:38,458 --> 00:24:44,042
server mode and supports
asynchronis operation, so we can
submit a  bunch of binary

187
00:24:44,042 --> 00:24:49,583
sequences to it. As it is able
to match those and give us back
potential keys we can check

188
00:24:49,583 --> 00:24:55,583
those keys in whatever order
they are returned. There is also
the potential to go ahead and

189
00:25:55,417 --> 00:26:00,583
run multiple instances in
parallel using load balancing to
allow the kraken cloud to be

190
00:26:00,583 --> 00:26:06,583
built. So our kit for twilight
vegetable that was sold used is
a  USB key and a nano SDR. The

191
00:26:09,583 --> 00:26:15,958
USB key is nice and fast. It is
customized with GSM tools. Oh,
and the second line is being

192
00:26:15,958 --> 00:26:21,833
covered. Anyway, being  ‑ ‑
it's, you do have to put in
persistent code to get the

193
00:26:21,833 --> 00:26:27,833
binary system built on it. We'll
go ahead and be released further
updates on it as we improve the

194
00:28:09,542 --> 00:28:15,542
system. Then we're also  ‑ ‑
including this, nano SDR. It is
extremely tiny. Give you an

195
00:28:19,833 --> 00:28:25,833
idea. This is the RTLSDR. And I
mean that is about as small as
you're going to get for software

196
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:39,875
defined radio that I have seen.
They are really cheap. They are
$20. They have improved the

197
00:28:39,875 --> 00:28:45,875
crystals and capacitors and they
come from a  company that
specializes in doing RTL, SDR

198
00:28:49,917 --> 00:28:55,917
stuff, not just T.V. tuners. So
this specific device, from 25 
megahertz. Higher bands such as

199
00:29:03,792 --> 00:29:09,792
the 1800 GSM band and another
bands I mentioned. The 850 band.
And the connector on it is

200
00:29:17,833 --> 00:29:25,333
standard MCX. Whatever active
antenna or better antenna you
manage to find, you don't have

201
00:29:25,333 --> 00:29:31,333
to deal with weird issues. This
is really nice. There is a few
things about them. I want to

202
00:29:37,083 --> 00:29:43,083
give them a shout out, they went
ahead and wrote nano SDRs. Free
swag is always good. They have

203
00:29:50,792 --> 00:29:57,583
improved electronics and gave
you guy as discount code. It is
good through the end of August.

204
00:29:57,583 --> 00:30:03,750
Most important, for a lot of you
guys they had bit coin for
software defined radio

205
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:09,750
purchases. That's also sort of
advantageous. And they work with
other SDR stuff. So they have

206
00:30:12,583 --> 00:30:18,000
more than just this in stock.
They know what they're talking
about if you have any questions

207
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:25,667
about if you can use a  given
SDR device for a  given purpose.
So that  ‑ ‑ that brings us to

208
00:30:25,667 --> 00:30:31,667
the next segment, which pierce
will take care of? >> Did you
get the SDR? Good stuff. It is

209
00:30:40,292 --> 00:30:47,333
pretty much a  16 gig USB if you
have one of your own the  ‑ ‑
image will be on the left. It is

210
00:30:47,333 --> 00:30:54,083
like 7 gigs or something, so it
might be hard to download at the
hotel. But  ‑ ‑ when you get

211
00:30:54,083 --> 00:31:00,083
home download the image and make
it  yourself. And we will be
releasing updates. Okay. So who

212
00:31:05,583 --> 00:31:12,083
here remembers the genesis
handset? It was the, it was
like, it was like a  telephone,

213
00:31:12,083 --> 00:31:18,083
right? That is because it pretty
much is, a  Motorola sliver L9.
If you look at the picture

214
00:31:22,125 --> 00:31:28,125
there. Elevated modifications, I
guess they added memory to it
and different SDR components.

215
00:31:30,417 --> 00:31:36,417
Essentially it is a  little
portable thing. NSA had genesis.
I thought it would be good to

216
00:31:38,958 --> 00:31:44,958
make  ‑ ‑ how do I get that out?
Yeah. No. Click. Yeah. Yeah. So
we made this handset. So  ‑ ‑

217
00:31:54,375 --> 00:32:00,375
and  ‑ ‑ so this is, I mean, it 
‑ ‑ it looks like a  regular
Motorola phone, that is because

218
00:32:03,292 --> 00:32:09,042
it is. You can buy these all
over eBay. It is crazy stuff.
This is the Motorola C139

219
00:32:09,042 --> 00:32:16,417
phones. So if you ever looked
into VD it is a  really great
project. Everyone should look

220
00:32:16,417 --> 00:32:20,083
into it. All of the
documentation and talks,
everything that you ever see

221
00:32:20,083 --> 00:32:25,792
about them talks about the C123.
Because of that and because of
all of the great information

222
00:32:25,792 --> 00:32:31,792
that have been found with the
123, they are kind of expensive
to buy on ebay. They go for

223
00:32:34,250 --> 00:32:41,792
$200  sometimes for the
$5phones. The 123 is good in
Europe, but the 139s are made

224
00:32:41,792 --> 00:32:44,167
for the U.S. And they work
really well in the United States
and they work really well with

225
00:32:44,167 --> 00:32:47,625
all of the OSMOCOM tools. If
you're on eBay buying phones by
the 139 it is great. So  ‑ ‑ the

226
00:32:47,625 --> 00:32:53,625
in addition to that, you also
need this custom SD cable that
talks serial over the micro

227
00:33:14,833 --> 00:33:20,125
audio port that is in the thing.
So you are pretty much connected
up and then all of the tools

228
00:33:20,125 --> 00:33:27,292
work with it. Also one thing
that I didn't quite realize
until I started playing with it.

229
00:33:27,292 --> 00:33:33,000
The firmware that you put onto
the phones actually exists only
inswww memory. You are typically

230
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:40,708
not supposed to persistently put
the things on the phone. So what
happens you turn your phone off

231
00:33:40,708 --> 00:33:46,708
and back on it is a  regular
cell phone, that's great. So as
part of the handset I wanted to

232
00:33:50,083 --> 00:33:56,083
throw good demos on the USB. If
you download USB or managed to
acquire one yesterday. I got

233
00:34:01,542 --> 00:34:05,500
this tool in the home director.
When you boot you boot into
persistent mode and all of the

234
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:11,500
tools are in the home directory.
RSSI is a firmware that does
kind of frequency scanning and 

235
00:34:16,750 --> 00:34:24,292
‑ ‑ it is pretty neat. So
dot/RSSI it loads the frequency
scanner. I will have a  demo of

236
00:34:24,292 --> 00:34:30,292
that in a  second here. I also
wanted to show off some actual,
you know, live GSM packet

237
00:34:32,667 --> 00:34:38,583
dumping. So I put on this layer
one pushes a  special image to
your phone that essentially

238
00:34:38,583 --> 00:34:44,583
turns it into a‑ ‑ like a  GSM
kind of gateway functional
thing. It is a layer one kind of

239
00:34:47,417 --> 00:34:52,708
device that you can do all of
your typical, like, a.m., you
know, cell phone tower,

240
00:34:52,708 --> 00:34:59,125
whatever, dialing, whatever. You
transmit it to layer one and it
spits it out GSM over the

241
00:34:59,125 --> 00:35:05,125
network. And then the CCCH scan.
I have it modified with a burst
and patch, if anybody knows what

242
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:15,500
that is. It allows for a lot of
GSM dumping and raw GSM traffic
on the network. That is great.

243
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:23,500
And then wire tracking can
navigate. That is good stuff. I
had a  couple of problems if

244
00:35:28,417 --> 00:35:32,292
anybody saw me trying to demo
the stuff yesterday. For some
reason Def Con made it so my

245
00:35:32,292 --> 00:35:38,292
console device was not TTYSO. It
turned into like  ‑ ‑ S4 or
whatever. So I added the shell

246
00:35:44,125 --> 00:35:49,000
scripts and everything works
fine. I had two more phones I
didn't want to sell it, they

247
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:55,000
were not working right. But I
got them working. I added the
control strip. I don't know. And

248
00:35:57,083 --> 00:36:03,083
also all of the charging is done
in software on the phones. It is
usually not a  good idea to  ‑ ‑

249
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:11,542
delete a  continuously charging
when it is plugged in. It might
not be as good as the actual

250
00:36:11,542 --> 00:36:16,000
official charging software that
is on there. And sometimes it
will overheat, sometimes they

251
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:23,583
will not really charge. Things
like that. I also really wanted
to enable BB stuff happening in

252
00:36:23,583 --> 00:36:29,583
the United States. There's a 
really great tool that Carson
related last year called GSM

253
00:36:31,667 --> 00:36:38,958
map. GSM map was a  bootable USB
stick you put up to it, you plug
in your phone and hit the button

254
00:36:38,958 --> 00:36:45,583
and it takes surveys of the GSM
networks around and you figures
out the security features they

255
00:36:45,583 --> 00:36:50,917
are using and packages they
applied and what they are doing.
It up loads the data. So if you

256
00:36:50,917 --> 00:36:56,917
go to GSM map.com, you will see
a  full map of the security
technologies over time. It is

257
00:36:59,958 --> 00:37:03,833
pretty much entirely Europe,
Europe has all of the data
sources. There is like three

258
00:37:03,833 --> 00:37:09,917
data sources in the U.S.
Everyone who gets the phones
should contribute to the

259
00:37:09,917 --> 00:37:16,583
project. It is really great and
it is really good to see 
security every time. So like I

260
00:37:16,583 --> 00:37:22,583
said, search eBay for the 139.
The TracFones have a  newer
firmware on it. You can still  ‑

261
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:30,333
‑ there are ways to bypass it,
but if you want to do the easy
way, buy these phones. They work

262
00:37:30,333 --> 00:37:37,083
great out of the box. A  guy
that I work with, reed, he makes
crazy modified hardware and

263
00:37:37,083 --> 00:37:43,083
sells them on eBay. So you can
look him up on eBay or e‑ mail
him directly. You can charge,

264
00:37:46,250 --> 00:37:52,250
and turn your phone into a  base
station, doing all sorts of fun
stuff. So another part of the

265
00:37:54,792 --> 00:38:00,792
project is the drizzle chair.
This is a tiny hard drive. This
is 2 terabytes. Like the tables

266
00:38:04,375 --> 00:38:07,875
that came out. People were
thinking 2 terabytes how many
things will I need to do that.

267
00:38:07,875 --> 00:38:13,875
Now, it is simple USB things you
can buy them for under $100. And
the first idea justs have all of

268
00:38:26,250 --> 00:38:34,042
the tools. One thing to know the
tables are in the partition, you
cannot download the fires into

269
00:38:34,042 --> 00:38:40,042
a  device. You have to download
the files and use a  tool to
insert them. If you buy one of

270
00:38:44,625 --> 00:38:48,458
these on‑ line make sure that
you have a hard drive in your
computer if you downloading it.

271
00:38:48,458 --> 00:38:55,250
You do need two, one to download
to and one to transfer them to
afterwards. So keep that in

272
00:38:55,250 --> 00:39:01,250
mind. And essentially what it
does, you can see cipher text
off of the network. There is a

273
00:39:07,250 --> 00:39:13,917
lot of traffic that's very, very
predictable in GSM. What you do,
you find a  packet that looks

274
00:39:13,917 --> 00:39:19,792
like a  packet that you
recognize and then you do work
between the two. What you get is

275
00:39:19,792 --> 00:39:27,625
the raw A51 stream. With the raw
A5/1 stream, you copy and paste
it into kraken and kraken goes

276
00:39:27,625 --> 00:39:34,167
through the rainbow table thing
and looks for a  result and then
dumps it out when it finds it.

277
00:39:34,167 --> 00:39:38,542
Then you can use either tool to
decrypt. >> Seeing any signal?
>> I might have to reboot to do

278
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:44,542
that. So what I'm doing now is
just booting up off of the USB.
I sold a  whole a  bunch

279
00:40:28,542 --> 00:40:34,542
yesterday. The exact same USB
stick you could download from
the Internet to make your own.

280
00:40:42,125 --> 00:40:48,125
And, let's see. The thing is, it
pretty much just has a  straight
Cali boot disk with the

281
00:40:50,333 --> 00:40:58,292
resistant image. So it is a  ‑ ‑
it is Cali 108, which was
release a few days ago. And than

282
00:40:58,292 --> 00:41:04,292
it is just a  home directory
full of tools all of the tools
do the sniffing, the decrypting,

283
00:41:06,958 --> 00:41:14,250
the cracking and  ‑ ‑ have  ‑ ‑
things like pineapple kind of
installed that kind of work. And

284
00:41:14,250 --> 00:41:20,000
all of the air pro stuff that is
a pain to compile on all of the
different systems. The

285
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:25,958
maintenance is not as good as it
could be for all of the tools
that are there. Let's see.

286
00:41:25,958 --> 00:41:31,958
Hopefully it starts up now. So
yeah. We just got all of the  ‑
‑ yeah  ‑ ‑ ah. It was working

287
00:41:40,375 --> 00:41:46,375
in the demo room. I don't know.
There's  ‑ ‑ yeah. Try that.
Okay. So we might not have a 

288
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:16,292
demo that looks like  ‑ ‑ the
projector is not working the way
it did in the demo room. But we

289
00:42:16,292 --> 00:42:22,292
might be able to show stuff on
your laptop? Okay. Yeah. Yeah.
Okay. Hmm. Let's see if this

290
00:42:37,250 --> 00:42:43,250
works. Okay. It is very small.
It takes a long time to run. It
will calibrate and scan through

291
00:43:17,750 --> 00:43:22,583
frequencies all of the possible
frequencies for a  given GSM and
tell you which channels are

292
00:43:22,583 --> 00:43:28,583
active. So I ran that and it
told me that the  ‑ ‑ test area
was  ‑ ‑ 180 which is A69.4. The

293
00:43:37,208 --> 00:43:44,542
scientific notation. And anyway,
if we go ahead and run this,
this is using the little nano

294
00:43:44,542 --> 00:43:50,542
SDR with this thing. It will
start scanning  ‑ ‑ so it is
going to find the only device on

295
00:43:52,542 --> 00:43:59,833
the system. Then if we flip over
to Wireshark I have a filter in
here right now that just shows

296
00:43:59,833 --> 00:44:06,667
immediately channel assignments
and these are the ones that are
important for when you are

297
00:44:06,667 --> 00:44:13,042
trying to capture encrypted
data. So you can see it has
captured five of them so far.

298
00:44:13,042 --> 00:44:19,750
And  ‑ ‑ ah  ‑ ‑ not going to be
able to show you too much. But 
‑ ‑ so you got your header

299
00:44:19,750 --> 00:44:25,208
telling you the channel it is on
and stuff like that and then you
immediate assignment data

300
00:44:25,208 --> 00:44:33,167
itself, which contains a channel
description that tells you, hey,
I now need to start capturing on

301
00:44:33,167 --> 00:44:39,167
zero, usually it is channel one
through seven must be control
traffic and be encrypted. It

302
00:44:41,208 --> 00:44:45,833
really is that simple to start
looking at GSM data in
Wireshark. If I remove the

303
00:44:45,833 --> 00:44:51,833
filter, um, let's see, you'll
see that it sends it to a  given
port, that port is not open now,

304
00:44:55,375 --> 00:45:01,375
but everyone  ‑ ‑ GSM tap
messages is coming through and
that's being captured live off

305
00:45:03,833 --> 00:45:09,833
of the air. So quick demo of
that for you guys. Do we want
to  ‑ ‑ do  ‑ ‑ that? Yeah. If

306
00:45:35,667 --> 00:45:41,667
anybody wants to stay afterwards
you can come up and see the
script. We have flags also. So

307
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:50,792
throw out your thing first? Any
questions? Good questions get
good swag. Bad questions get

308
00:45:50,792 --> 00:45:56,792
heavy things. So  ‑ ‑ yes? How
long? Two minutes. Okay. Two
minutes. 45? So we'll be in the

309
00:46:04,833 --> 00:46:10,833
chill out cafe for Q & A. If you
got good questions you get SDRs.
Ask us questions. Thank you very

310
00:46:24,833 --> 00:46:30,833
much.
