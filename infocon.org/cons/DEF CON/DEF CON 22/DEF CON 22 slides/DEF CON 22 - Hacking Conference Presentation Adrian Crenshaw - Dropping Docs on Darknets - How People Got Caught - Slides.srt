1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,417
>>I'm here to talk about
Dropping Docs on Darknets. How
people got caught and talk about

2
00:00:07,417 --> 00:00:10,958
some things about the history,
various people who have been
using tour or sometimes

3
00:00:10,958 --> 00:00:16,958
itemizing systems and have
gotten busted still, in all of
these cases, none of it was tour

4
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:25,625
directly, all bad  ‑ ‑ all, I'll
cover what they screwed up. To
save a little time, how many of

5
00:00:25,625 --> 00:00:32,583
you have been to my website?
Okay, fair enough. My name is
Adrian Crenshaw, I am likely to

6
00:00:32,583 --> 00:00:37,083
get something wrong, like if you
ask me about the newest relay
that people are talking about

7
00:00:37,083 --> 00:00:43,083
with tour I'm only this much up
on it, so I probably contact get
it for you but I'm interested in

8
00:00:50,583 --> 00:00:57,125
learning on it. I'm also senior
information security consultant,
and they were kind enough to fly

9
00:00:57,125 --> 00:01:03,125
me out here and also a cofounder
of derby con. Executive general
warning I'm taking this from two

10
00:01:07,542 --> 00:01:12,500
perspectives how to keep people
anonymous and how to be
anonymous people, I want

11
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:18,500
anonymized, I think all secrets
should be known if would
probably be a better place but

12
00:01:25,167 --> 00:01:31,167
people with more power are
better at keeping secrets than
others. But I'm interested in

13
00:01:36,667 --> 00:01:44,375
like I chest game, how to keep
it, it's just an intellectual
interest for me. I am not a

14
00:01:44,375 --> 00:01:50,875
lawyer, some of the things I'm
going to talk about is legal
stuff, any legal advice I give

15
00:01:50,875 --> 00:01:57,125
is not legal invoice in the
definition of legal advice. If
something has the word I

16
00:01:57,125 --> 00:02:04,083
understand in it several times
it means that they know that
they're lying but they don't

17
00:02:04,083 --> 00:02:10,083
want to be called on it. I don't
like lawyers, if there was such
a thing, I believe I have one,

18
00:02:13,083 --> 00:02:19,083
so I won't say I never need one.
Anyway, be careful what you say,
most of the people out there I

19
00:02:25,125 --> 00:02:31,125
think are techno meanies like me
to just like encryption bull
some people are university

20
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:40,000
administrators, but groups do
exist that are bad, so be
careful where you web certain,

21
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,042
if you do E certain, I highly
recommend automatically
downloading. Let's just say I

22
00:02:44,042 --> 00:02:50,042
have a friend of mine who is in
research, I this is his flame is
Bob who actually to give a talk

23
00:02:53,125 --> 00:02:58,750
at DEF CON on dark notes and he
was looking through this and
there was a picture of himself

24
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:04,708
right next to a bunch of child
porn, because there are some
disturbed people out there, so

25
00:03:04,708 --> 00:03:09,542
be careful where you surf, but
most of the stuff I think is
fairly innocent. We're going to

26
00:03:09,542 --> 00:03:15,542
talk about how it works. Tour'
is sometimes referred to as a
dark net and it uses proxies and

27
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:25,583
multiple levels in description.
I like the term cyberspace, I
think it sounds cool and dark

28
00:03:25,583 --> 00:03:31,583
net means something different.
That's a piece of IT space to
say that anybody who is touching

29
00:03:35,667 --> 00:03:41,667
it, we know it has to be
illegitimate, so we shun them,
it has two meanings, that's why

30
00:03:43,708 --> 00:03:49,708
like dark net better. This is
the onion router, the most
popular one out there. It

31
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:58,833
doesn't have as big a base as
tour does. This started off as a
Navy research project back in

32
00:04:03,542 --> 00:04:10,250
the day, eventually, the EFF
took over and then it became
it's own 5013 C. This is for

33
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:16,250
privacy, this is so you can surf
the web and not have you know
who you are than host something

34
00:04:19,875 --> 00:04:25,875
and not be able to shut it down.
They can cost it via a hidden
service, hidden services don't

35
00:04:30,208 --> 00:04:36,208
have a website, they can be
other hidden service, anything
old thing cull do over TCP. But

36
00:04:38,375 --> 00:04:42,917
mostly with the anonymous sites,
we are talking about Human
Services in this talk but how

37
00:04:42,917 --> 00:04:49,667
you access it, you have a proxy
in your local machine and you
can put in web browsers to it

38
00:04:49,667 --> 00:04:53,708
and it just generally functions
all the time, hopefully. It's
hard to get that configured

39
00:04:53,708 --> 00:05:00,083
right if you do it from your own
browser, which is why extremely
recommend that you use the tour

40
00:05:00,083 --> 00:05:06,083
browser bundle that has all of
this for you. But yeah like I
said before it's layers of

41
00:05:10,375 --> 00:05:16,375
encryption. The data you send
out is the same way, I say that
here because some other dark

42
00:05:22,958 --> 00:05:30,250
nets are different, you're out
tunnels and in tunnels can be
different, but tour is basically

43
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:35,542
bidirectional. It has directory
service which can be a simple
point of failure, but it used

44
00:05:35,542 --> 00:05:40,292
distributed hash tables for some
of the hidden service stuff, I
need to look at the tech manual

45
00:05:40,292 --> 00:05:45,250
more to understand where they
use which one for what. A few
years back, the serves kept a

46
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:52,375
lot of people from accessing
tour directly, so they need to
use some sort of tour bridge

47
00:05:52,375 --> 00:05:58,375
node, but it is generally come
posed of multiple levels of
encryption. What they do is they

48
00:06:00,792 --> 00:06:07,875
have three levels of encryption,
one first of the first who that
gets stripped off, there's

49
00:06:07,875 --> 00:06:12,750
another one inside of that which
is the second who then another
one for the third hop, at that

50
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:18,750
point, the exit point which is
that last node decrypts and send
it is on. It's still going to be

51
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:30,042
encrypted but the people in that
exit point can see the traffic
they're sniffing about using

52
00:06:30,042 --> 00:06:36,042
HTTL, they can see that stuff.
This is different, say you want
to the host something, I want to

53
00:06:38,042 --> 00:06:45,875
start up a site, Polyester Road
because I'm going to sell zoot
suits, from like the '70s for

54
00:06:45,875 --> 00:06:51,875
like lounge lizards, so I wanted
to go ahead. I'm Bob, I want to
stat Polyester Road, I can send

55
00:07:01,667 --> 00:07:07,583
that to the DB and have it known
what my points are and that's
advertising for my onion

56
00:07:07,583 --> 00:07:13,583
address, usually it's semi
random, it's mostly random, you
can brute force and make it kind

57
00:07:16,292 --> 00:07:21,542
of an especially signed name if
you want. Have you ever been
Slick Road's website, the first

58
00:07:21,542 --> 00:07:29,042
few characters, there is a way
to brute force and assign a name
that you want close to but you

59
00:07:29,042 --> 00:07:33,542
can't do the entire thing
because it's a little bit too
long for you to do it. The GPU

60
00:07:33,542 --> 00:07:39,750
systems are coming out with
those names. Alice finds out
about the it, she finds out the

61
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:46,625
introduction point, and she sets
the boundary point so that Bob
can talk back to her, sends that

62
00:07:46,625 --> 00:07:52,375
information to introduction
points and they can start
talking about how they're going

63
00:07:52,375 --> 00:07:58,250
to communicate and eventually
set up a channel and start
moving data back and forth. I

64
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:02,833
know I'm going through this all
of fast, but really it's better
to read the website on how to

65
00:08:02,833 --> 00:08:10,375
works, but we both agree who
we're going to anonymously, and
hosting it and people don't know

66
00:08:10,375 --> 00:08:16,375
who is hosting it and that's a
good idea. There is node ideas
in tour, they're just general

67
00:08:18,833 --> 00:08:24,833
clients that use tour, these
relays and these are people who
hand traffic on to the next

68
00:08:27,542 --> 00:08:33,250
person but they're not
necessarily exit point where is
it sometimes get tricky, in the

69
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:39,500
United States, it's legal to
have an exit point, Austria had
some problems because contraband

70
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,583
was going across, but you can
get exit points meaning bad
stuff is going through the

71
00:08:41,583 --> 00:08:48,542
system? You generally are not at
fault for it. There's always
bridges, remember I mentioned

72
00:08:48,542 --> 00:08:54,542
those directory services before
that shut down, bridges are
basically core nodes that are

73
00:08:57,250 --> 00:09:03,292
not advertised in the directory,
so the only reason you can get
them is think of the pathway or

74
00:09:03,292 --> 00:09:07,750
the website and they would email
you certain bridges they could
use. The idea is none of the

75
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:14,208
bridges are listed in one place
so you can get on if you can't
get on the directly, that was

76
00:09:14,208 --> 00:09:20,625
the idea of the berms and
they're slightly more trusted
nodes for the first hop. It

77
00:09:20,625 --> 00:09:26,292
might be your first hop and your
last hop and if I'm watching
traffic I can kind of figure out

78
00:09:26,292 --> 00:09:32,292
who you are. And this is a guy
not giving a talk now, they were
doing a type of  ‑ ‑ if I

79
00:09:34,917 --> 00:09:40,917
understand what I read about it,
they were adding some tags to
the data. But the guard node, I

80
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:50,792
don't know how the process for
that worked but they could
become more than one

81
00:09:50,792 --> 00:09:53,208
[indiscernible] if you can
control multiple nodes in the
networks you can [indiscernible]

82
00:09:53,208 --> 00:10:01,208
there are also introduction
points which I mentioned other
points, you get a web browser,

83
00:10:01,208 --> 00:10:07,208
you get tour up and run, you use
the tour browser bundle, you
download it, unzip it and just

84
00:10:10,125 --> 00:10:17,958
use it, set up your own tour
service, it's more complex, I
have links in slides, I have a

85
00:10:17,958 --> 00:10:24,750
three‑ hour class I did, and it
covers the same thing in ITP.
Okay. Applications, there's tons

86
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:31,208
of stuff out there, I wasn't to
give a quick shout out to tails,
tails is essentially a live CD,

87
00:10:31,208 --> 00:10:37,000
you can also do it
[indiscernible] that there's a
lost things add‑ ons to tour

88
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,458
that make it more secure, and
since the plug‑ ins are not
going to be there, other

89
00:10:41,458 --> 00:10:47,458
authorizations, generally, every
time you sit down to start, that
kind of thing, it's what you do

90
00:10:53,083 --> 00:10:57,833
as long as you get the memory
fast enough, you are generally
okay. Do you know what a code

91
00:10:57,833 --> 00:11:03,833
rude attack, if they can hit you
hard enough and past enough,
they can pull memory out, they

92
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:13,458
pull it out and mount it and
suck off all the data, if they
do that fast enough, they can

93
00:11:13,458 --> 00:11:17,375
[indiscernible] so the amount of
time it takes is probably  ‑ ‑
it would probably be okay. And

94
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:23,375
we're talking anti‑ forensics,
also. You don't want to look it
up, trust me. This other tool

95
00:11:31,417 --> 00:11:36,708
that is out there scallion, if
you look at the silk roads one,
I think I have this up, they

96
00:11:36,708 --> 00:11:39,750
brute forced the part of it, oh,
crud, I don't have  ‑ ‑ let me
bring this up real  ‑ ‑ yeah.

97
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:41,833
Notice how they brute forced the
first part of it because they
actually have Silk Road as one

98
00:11:41,833 --> 00:11:43,833
of the characters but the rest
is random. I have to mention the
security concern because it

99
00:11:43,833 --> 00:11:46,375
lessens the [indiscernible] but
will be able to tell you better,
but let's get back to the

100
00:11:46,375 --> 00:11:52,375
slides. But there are always
tools out there, if you want to
know more about hidden services,

101
00:12:16,708 --> 00:12:23,625
go visit the public Internet
site on onions where you will
find various ones lited. There

102
00:12:23,625 --> 00:12:29,625
are pros and cons, a big pro is
anything you can do here you can
make it work, like this over

103
00:12:32,417 --> 00:12:39,125
tour perfectly feasible and
three levels of proxy, it gives
you a lot of anonymity, the

104
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:44,708
downside it it's slow, a lot
footer than it used toking but
yet never going to be as fast as

105
00:12:44,708 --> 00:12:49,375
just using the public Internet,
it can't be. Because you have
all of these extra hops you are

106
00:12:49,375 --> 00:12:54,292
going into. You have to trust
your exit node, they didn't want
the country they were in to spy

107
00:12:54,292 --> 00:13:01,458
and you want to get out of the
country, without the French
people spying on you, you might

108
00:13:01,458 --> 00:13:07,458
use tour but using the top 3
without encryption, whatever
your exit point is it's going to

109
00:13:09,583 --> 00:13:14,167
be sniffing your traveling and
people did things like that and
I mentioned the great fire wall

110
00:13:14,167 --> 00:13:21,333
of China blocking 80% of the
relays a while back and so those
were all issues but it is the

111
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:27,792
biggest point [indiscernible].
Before all right. What does the
traffic look like? Ports for

112
00:13:27,792 --> 00:13:33,792
your proxies and you're using
manual rapport, using your tour
browser bundle, this is a hidden

113
00:13:37,542 --> 00:13:43,542
service, use the tour browser
bundle or tail. Usually, there
are some 80, I'm not sure if

114
00:13:47,875 --> 00:13:53,458
that's still current, there's a
lot more detail on my website
and there are ways you can

115
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:59,875
detect it also, saying is this
IP address part of tour, part of
tour directory, you can query

116
00:13:59,875 --> 00:14:07,542
them and find out. There's a
little onion icon in the top
left‑ hand corner instead of the

117
00:14:07,542 --> 00:14:13,542
normal one. Oh quick shout out
to ITP I don't know if anybody
got busted on it, not because

118
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:22,625
it's more secure but it's used
less, and having different
people doing different kinds of

119
00:14:22,625 --> 00:14:27,333
research in this kind of
community is important I think
and that's another big player

120
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:33,333
out there, tour pretty much is
the 800‑ pound grill gorilla
when it comes to dark net. There

121
00:14:35,542 --> 00:14:42,750
is a Goon named Bob and he gives
a great talk, Bob Rice on bit
point, so I recorded it once, go

122
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:50,625
check that one out but
essentially, by the coin is a
quick currency that is used for

123
00:14:50,625 --> 00:14:56,250
proof of work, this is not bit
coin work, but this is proof of
work to you. It really came up

124
00:14:56,250 --> 00:15:00,833
as a way of stopping spam, let's
say the idea is if you want to
send me a message, you've got to

125
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:05,750
do some work before you can
extend to me, this way if you're
a spammer it's going to

126
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:08,875
discourage you, I'm not
discouraged from sending emails
but if it takes more than a

127
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:14,875
second for spam to calculate it
slows them down massively from
being able to use spam

128
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:22,708
campaigns, so an example is this
one for most security people.
This is really fast to take a

129
00:15:22,708 --> 00:15:28,708
password and patch it to of to
the hash value, however taking a
hash value and turning it back

130
00:15:31,833 --> 00:15:37,708
into the password is much more
difficult, so a proof of work
example might be you can only

131
00:15:37,708 --> 00:15:42,250
send an email to me if you boat
force my password it's a 4
character password and here's my

132
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:48,208
hash and a four character
password you should be able to
do that fast but it's still a

133
00:15:48,208 --> 00:15:55,125
little time and it's not a
nuisance, but it might be to
others, by the coin uses a

134
00:15:55,125 --> 00:16:03,042
similar kind of system of proof
of work, also in big blocks that
they communicate through passing

135
00:16:03,042 --> 00:16:10,792
on bit coins to say I now
assigned these bit coins I own
to this particular address. But

136
00:16:10,792 --> 00:16:16,792
watch Bob's talk on it, it's a
innate, if you want to send
stuff anonymously, it's the way

137
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:25,000
to go. There are alternate stuff
out there, like doggy coin and I
don't know how many others. But

138
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:34,292
check out Bob Rice's talk
sometime. I burned through that
in 12 minutes because want to

139
00:16:34,292 --> 00:16:39,500
get to the good stuff.
Basically, we're talking about
how people got deanonymized, and

140
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:44,083
the first thing I want to talk
about is the Harvard bomb
threat. Here's what he said,

141
00:16:44,083 --> 00:16:50,083
there is a bomb placed in the
science center, 204, be quick or
they'll go off seen. He sent

142
00:17:00,042 --> 00:17:05,792
this on December  16th. Well,
they had to figure out who this
guy was. Apparently, he used his

143
00:17:05,792 --> 00:17:11,792
gorilla mail. I sent my own
message using gorilla mail and
one thing it does is it uses

144
00:17:17,667 --> 00:17:23,417
your originating IP address,
that's not mine, I modified it
some, but it can originate

145
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:28,708
[indiscernible], so Let's say
you did it from home, your IP
address would be in that mail

146
00:17:28,708 --> 00:17:34,708
and you can look in the header
this guy did use tour, it had a
server IP address, that was a

147
00:17:37,792 --> 00:17:42,958
step in the right direction, of
course. However, all nodes are
public and it's easy to figure

148
00:17:42,958 --> 00:17:49,375
out is this machine tour or not,
you just look it up, and you
justifying out if it was a node

149
00:17:49,375 --> 00:17:55,375
a lot of times they have tour in
the name of them, so it's easy
to correlate who was attacking.

150
00:17:58,167 --> 00:18:03,458
Well, what they did is they
looked to see who was using tour
during the time that the email

151
00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:08,500
was sent. And they found this
one particular individual, now
this guy had been using a

152
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:12,125
bridge, but [indiscernible] it
would have been advertising
directly he probably would have

153
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:18,000
got away with it but if he just
walked to the local coffee shop
and used tour he probably would

154
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:23,792
have gotten away with it
however, he used it through the
university network. He was one

155
00:18:23,792 --> 00:18:34,500
of the few people on tour at the
time, I don't know what Harvard
does with anonymity, but he was

156
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:45,708
using tour but when he found out
he was one of them, he admitted
to everything and apparently he

157
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:56,250
put to the in to get out of a
final, and so he sent that in
just to get out of a final. Oh

158
00:18:56,250 --> 00:19:04,667
well, more details, there's
great write ups, also, court
documents out, these slides by

159
00:19:04,667 --> 00:19:14,625
the wear are very close to the
exact version should be on your
DEF CON and I have them online.

160
00:19:14,625 --> 00:19:19,750
>> [Off mic]. >> And he did it
from  ‑ ‑ well, the Harvard
network, I think maybe his dorm

161
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:25,625
room, I don't remember the exact
location. >> [Off mic]. >> Yes.
>> [Off mic]. >> So lesson

162
00:19:25,625 --> 00:19:32,375
learned from this, don't be the
only person using tour at a
given time, use the bridge, if

163
00:19:32,375 --> 00:19:39,917
you had used the bridge,
probably wouldn't have been
caught. Don't admit anything.

164
00:19:39,917 --> 00:19:45,250
That would have gone a long way.
And correlation attack or bitch
and we'll talk more about a

165
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:49,792
correlation attack here in a
second. Essentially what a
correlation attack is you watch

166
00:19:49,792 --> 00:19:55,583
the traffic and see what's going
on. Everything is encrypted but
if you see a 5 Meg request,

167
00:19:55,583 --> 00:20:01,542
which would be a big request but
still and then go out and you
watch this node and this node,

168
00:20:01,542 --> 00:20:07,542
you can tell these two are evil,
especially are the goatee, Ralph
looks like my evil computer, but

169
00:20:12,083 --> 00:20:18,500
anyway, these guys were sniffing
it, so this one and this one,
this was a similar attack,

170
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:23,917
someone controls both of those
nodes and he says I saw 5 meg
come in this way and out that

171
00:20:23,917 --> 00:20:27,958
way and I saw a 8 meg come back,
see go out that way, come back
this way and you can see them

172
00:20:27,958 --> 00:20:33,958
both. Now, grant, the encryption
there, the message don't look
the same because they have extra

173
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:46,583
crypto keys in the middle, I'm
pointing here, why am I doing
that? Yeah, like this guy right

174
00:20:46,583 --> 00:20:51,500
here. So I mean, the traffic
doesn't look the same, it's
different feeds but this was

175
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:57,208
actually the size and the timing
of it they have a good idea that
this might be who it is. Now, in

176
00:20:57,208 --> 00:21:03,125
this case, the correlation
attack was who was using tour at
that particular time. Timing

177
00:21:03,125 --> 00:21:09,125
correlation might be similar.
Pain in my buttocks! All right.
Let's see if this crash again or

178
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:27,792
not I'll get myself together
here. Shift F 5. Macintosh.
Okay. So that was the attack I

179
00:21:39,333 --> 00:21:42,375
was mentioning before just
looking at traffic. There is
also the timing attacks that can

180
00:21:42,375 --> 00:21:46,792
be possibly done based on when
the traffic is coming through
and there's been some work on

181
00:21:46,792 --> 00:21:52,792
people trying to DDOS part of
the network to know I've DOS'd
that and I can put  ‑ ‑ well, if

182
00:21:56,708 --> 00:22:01,417
I can force certain patterns in
the traffic, you might be able
to recognize that. (Lost audio).

183
00:22:01,417 --> 00:22:07,417
Company, let's see. No, history
buff, no. >> [Off mic]. >> They
had this party called Molanear,

184
00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:01,417
and it's a document that is a
little bit like this, called an
expert tracker along the way so

185
00:23:01,417 --> 00:23:07,708
you can kind of modify and put a
pattern to the data, I could be
misreading it. Somebody from

186
00:23:07,708 --> 00:23:13,708
NSA, if they want to talk it me
about it, I would love to hear.
>> [Off mic]. >> Just saying the

187
00:23:15,875 --> 00:23:21,292
little hat here. All right.
Another thing, this is not
[indiscernible] remember how I

188
00:23:21,292 --> 00:23:27,875
mentioned how sometimes you can
really screw it up if you set up
the browser itself, if you set

189
00:23:27,875 --> 00:23:33,875
up tour in Firefox itself not
using the browser bundle, there
is a setting that says use it

190
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:47,500
over the proxy, when you query
polyester road.onion, they want
see the traffic but they will

191
00:23:50,458 --> 00:23:54,625
see that you are trying to go to
that particular site, that's why
if are you going to set up

192
00:23:54,625 --> 00:24:00,625
yourself, you have to do
something like proxy relay DNS
but the tour browser by default

193
00:24:04,667 --> 00:24:10,667
does that. They can see who
you're trying to visit based on
the DNS queries. Okay. Next

194
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:19,292
case. You remember this from a
couple of years ago, right?
Hector Xavier Monsignor, I'm

195
00:24:19,292 --> 00:24:25,292
going to call him Boo because
that is easier to remember. He
got lazy one time and he got

196
00:24:36,792 --> 00:24:41,333
himself caught and started to
collaborate with people so he
wouldn't go to job. Last I

197
00:24:41,333 --> 00:24:47,333
heard, he got off exactly now, I
think he's home free at that
point, but anyway, he didn't use

198
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:55,417
tour consistently, eventually,
they found him, and I don't
understand some of these people

199
00:24:55,417 --> 00:25:01,417
that do this, why don't you use
ITP, and you can do it all over
anonymous networks, because even

200
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:10,875
if you use a cloaking, a cloak
that hides your IP address from
other people doing things, it

201
00:25:10,875 --> 00:25:16,875
still is a problem because the
person who owns the service
might look into your IP address

202
00:25:18,917 --> 00:25:24,917
and figure out who you are.
There is actually a guy to lives
in great Britain who was part of

203
00:25:24,917 --> 00:25:29,125
the anonymous movement at one
time and he got pissed off at
other people and he was on one

204
00:25:29,125 --> 00:25:35,708
of the IRC servers so he started
dumping the IP addresses. So if
you are using ITP and IRC, he

205
00:25:35,708 --> 00:25:41,708
probably wouldn't have got
caught. He was speaking with
such G, ends up it's Jeremy

206
00:25:44,917 --> 00:25:50,917
Hammond, but they didn't know
that at the time. And Jeremy had
been arrested or detained

207
00:25:54,250 --> 00:26:00,750
before, and various political
groups he was involved with and
they got a general idea for

208
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:05,208
where in the world he lived and
this narrowed down the suspect
pool a whole lot and they

209
00:26:05,208 --> 00:26:11,208
finally got enough evidence to
be able to get  ‑ ‑ well, the
marker was in the access.

210
00:26:13,333 --> 00:26:18,333
Because I was doing things like
I was involved with the people,
doing some of the things that he

211
00:26:18,333 --> 00:26:22,500
said made it very clear that he
lived in the Midwest and there
are only so many people that fit

212
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:28,958
those kinds of qualities and
already have a record, so they
were able to narrow it down.

213
00:26:28,958 --> 00:26:35,042
Now, he did use tour
consistently, from the records I
read and he was never busted but

214
00:26:35,042 --> 00:26:41,833
this were able to use
essentially time and sequential
time and correlation attacks to

215
00:26:41,833 --> 00:26:49,542
figure out he was always online
at the same time Hammond was and
talking when [indiscernible] was

216
00:26:49,542 --> 00:26:55,542
talking to [indiscernible] he
was in his residence. They were
able to figure out well, seems

217
00:26:59,167 --> 00:27:06,042
likely that it is indeed him. A
lot more details and technical
articles, but there's a few

218
00:27:06,042 --> 00:27:13,333
lessons from this one. Lessons
learned: Use tour consistently,
if you use it part of the time

219
00:27:13,333 --> 00:27:18,375
that's going to cause a problem.
Back in the day when you had to
configure it for yourself, one

220
00:27:18,375 --> 00:27:24,375
thing that was really cool to do
is get the cookies in tour, when
you disconnect tour you go back

221
00:27:24,375 --> 00:27:27,833
and visit the site against
without tour, you see that
cookie and you know who that

222
00:27:27,833 --> 00:27:35,708
was. I have a future on my
website that does that. If you
are using tour browser, it's

223
00:27:35,708 --> 00:27:42,958
going to clear out that history
every time you shut it down. But
yeah, if you use tour

224
00:27:42,958 --> 00:27:47,917
consistently, don't give out a
lot of personal information,
don't release a bunch of stuff

225
00:27:47,917 --> 00:27:54,500
about these are the people I'm
languaging out with, these are
the people I'm involved in.

226
00:27:54,500 --> 00:28:00,583
Also, correlation tactic is
still a bitch, because when he
was online versus when he was

227
00:28:00,583 --> 00:28:06,875
talking to Boo, they figured out
who he was. Case No.  2, by the
way, the cases that kind of

228
00:28:06,875 --> 00:28:12,875
stick out, I'm following the
program standard of 0. So Case
No.  2, freedom hosting. Now,

229
00:28:15,458 --> 00:28:19,750
freedom hosting is a company
that basically allowed people
to  ‑ ‑ hosting services inside

230
00:28:19,750 --> 00:28:23,750
of tour so they didn't have to
set their own boxes for hidden
services and they would

231
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:28,375
basically use these people but
they hosted a lot of different
things amongst them some child

232
00:28:28,375 --> 00:28:34,250
porn related services, not the
only thing they were about but
some of the stuff they had, they

233
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:39,083
also had length mat stuff like
tour mail, but that's as to you
have the stuff that particular

234
00:28:39,083 --> 00:28:45,083
group ran. Because of the whole
posting the child porn anonymous
had an opp document where they

235
00:28:48,875 --> 00:28:54,875
were attacking them and trying
to hack the websites and I think
at one point they dumped a bunch

236
00:28:56,917 --> 00:29:02,042
of information about who was
using them. Just because
anonymous doesn't mean the web

237
00:29:02,042 --> 00:29:08,792
application isn't vulnerable,
and that's how they dumped a
bunch of accounts from them.

238
00:29:08,792 --> 00:29:14,792
What is that? >> Oh. >> Oh, on
July  13th, the FBI found the
hosting boxes and decided to

239
00:29:20,083 --> 00:29:26,083
insert some malicious Java
script. And it existed in
Firefox, version 17, extended

240
00:29:28,458 --> 00:29:33,833
service release, and a recent
version of tour browser win
doughs happened to be using that

241
00:29:33,833 --> 00:29:39,375
particular version of Firefox so
it was vulnerable, now tour had
only updated the panel, if all

242
00:29:39,375 --> 00:29:45,917
of the people had updated by
that time they wouldn't have
gotten caught because they

243
00:29:45,917 --> 00:29:50,667
weren't involved in this but
some people don't if you date in
a timely fashion, so they had

244
00:29:50,667 --> 00:29:54,875
this vulnerability, and they
installed this malware, they
installed Magnito, and it was a

245
00:29:54,875 --> 00:30:00,875
service in Virginia, and it
would host the public IP
address, some of the content you

246
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:20,167
see, Mac addresses they were
pointed that can narrow it down
to your machine, the windows

247
00:30:20,167 --> 00:30:26,167
host name and in the site visit.
This one is kind of similar to
[indiscernible] Snowden

248
00:30:30,375 --> 00:30:37,042
documents, coming across the
egotistical direct project, this
is a beautiful name, I don't

249
00:30:37,042 --> 00:30:41,958
think it's exactly the same
exploit though. They exploit but
not entirely the same project

250
00:30:41,958 --> 00:30:47,708
with the FBI, because I don't
think the United States
collaborated that much. There's

251
00:30:47,708 --> 00:30:54,167
a lot of cases in the past of
law enforcement doing something
similar like getting malware

252
00:30:54,167 --> 00:30:57,583
getting installed on machines
and track them and see what
they're up to. There was a NSA

253
00:30:57,583 --> 00:31:03,583
project, GB 8, what is great
Britain equivalent's to the NSA?
I may get this wrong so just

254
00:31:15,875 --> 00:31:20,125
pointing it out and if I get it
wrong let me know after the
talk. And CPAB is another

255
00:31:20,125 --> 00:31:27,042
example, Joe gave a talk that
was really good, unfortunately,
it was not recorded, so if you

256
00:31:27,042 --> 00:31:32,500
ever get to talk with him go
check that out. He might even be
here at DEF CON. The first time

257
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:38,500
I met him was at DEF CON 2009.
Anyway, freedom hosting, the box
you will be able to take malware

258
00:31:40,708 --> 00:31:46,333
off the machines, and you can
Figure out who is hosting or who
the head guy is in charge of

259
00:31:46,333 --> 00:31:52,333
hosting and it ended up being
this Marquez. They always traced
him down because of the way he

260
00:31:57,542 --> 00:32:04,542
made the payment. Once they
compromised the box and realized
this is the IP address, they

261
00:32:04,542 --> 00:32:10,542
found out who was actually
leasing the box and this tied
him to it pretty quick. Now,

262
00:32:12,542 --> 00:32:20,375
when they busted him he is said
to have diced for his laptop to
shut it down. If the machine was

263
00:32:20,375 --> 00:32:28,042
shut down, it has full hub drive
in description, you don't beat
it mathematically, you beat it

264
00:32:28,042 --> 00:32:35,292
through limitation or rubber
host cryptography, he apparently
though didn't get to it fast

265
00:32:35,292 --> 00:32:41,292
enough. A lot more details in an
article on it. Lessons learns
from this one: Don't host

266
00:32:52,208 --> 00:32:55,458
[indiscernible] that's one
thing. You're not
[indiscernible] in culture are

267
00:32:55,458 --> 00:33:01,458
you Beshear is jail bit, captain
card, CP, child porn, actually,
I gave a talk a few years back,

268
00:33:12,083 --> 00:33:18,083
at a security forum, it was some
ISA appoint and I gave a talk on
anonymous, they are one cohesive

269
00:33:21,458 --> 00:33:28,583
group, for home to want to go
and do a particular thing and I
used a bunch of in culture

270
00:33:28,583 --> 00:33:36,250
terminology, things that are
offensive, people who do it for
the lulls and control people, so

271
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:43,167
I was using in term  ‑ ‑ in
culture terminology and in think
what he said about me not

272
00:33:43,167 --> 00:33:48,000
getting invited about is I
wonder if [indiscernible] talk
was well researched and it was

273
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:54,000
wholly inappropriate, if you get
to know the guy, okay, maybe it
was some what true. The next

274
00:34:01,583 --> 00:34:05,208
thing you can learn, patch patch
patch. If these people had have
kept up their patches, they

275
00:34:05,208 --> 00:34:09,292
would have been fine and dandy.
I don't think they put the
warning at the time, now if you

276
00:34:09,292 --> 00:34:13,125
have an outdated version, you
will see a warning next to the
onion that says, there's a newer

277
00:34:13,125 --> 00:34:16,833
version out you should really
update, I don't think they were
doing that at the time. Is

278
00:34:16,833 --> 00:34:23,042
anybody here from tour project
here? I guess they can't answer
that question now. I don't I

279
00:34:23,042 --> 00:34:29,917
think they were doing that at
the time. Also, my standing is
they tied the server to him via

280
00:34:29,917 --> 00:34:36,458
how he paid for them. and
leaving encrypted laptops
powered down when not in reviews

281
00:34:36,458 --> 00:34:42,458
would have helped a lot. This is
some kind of web vulnerability,
let's say they had an injection,

282
00:34:51,375 --> 00:34:55,750
if you can connect to it, send
your exploit to it, even if it's
encrypted getting there, you can

283
00:34:55,750 --> 00:35:00,875
make it contact you outside of
the tour network, depending on
what fire walls are in place and

284
00:35:00,875 --> 00:35:05,792
so forth. This would be harder
on tails because they have rules
in place to keep you from doing

285
00:35:05,792 --> 00:35:12,958
that but it's just like my old
box I set up to use tour for and
I happened to have a command

286
00:35:12,958 --> 00:35:19,667
injection vulnerability, they
can ping themselves or do a
trace and have a good idea of

287
00:35:19,667 --> 00:35:25,667
who it actually is with the IP
address. That brings us to case
3, the silk road, who else knows

288
00:35:29,333 --> 00:35:35,333
about these guy, okay. Silk road
is something that is ran by an
gay named dread pirate Roberts

289
00:35:37,958 --> 00:35:45,667
and it allowed buyers and
sellers to exchange less than
legal goods, there is all sorts

290
00:35:45,667 --> 00:35:49,125
of things that they would sell
on there. Here is some stuff in
the court couples, Ectasy,

291
00:35:49,125 --> 00:35:55,125
opiate, all sorts of really,
really fun stuff. This is Tommy
C's stuff in here. So but it

292
00:36:09,042 --> 00:36:12,500
also said other things like
various services, people would
hire someone to attack a system

293
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:18,792
for you, you could find
counterfeit bills, and other
things that you could have

294
00:36:18,792 --> 00:36:25,917
currencies, I'm a little
confused about some of that.
Also, they had a fellow that

295
00:36:25,917 --> 00:36:33,417
forged diplomas. >> [Off mic].
>> I'm not sure what the deal is
with that but anyway they were

296
00:36:33,417 --> 00:36:39,375
making some big bucks. $1.2 
million  ‑ ‑ billion, the FBI
got a little interested in these

297
00:36:39,375 --> 00:36:45,292
guys, so they started looking
around for the silk road on the
public Internet it you can use

298
00:36:45,292 --> 00:36:50,083
Google operators to say give me
everything from this time period
to this time mered and you can

299
00:36:50,083 --> 00:36:56,083
find the earliest reference to
the Silk Road and they found it
on [indiscernible] a little

300
00:36:58,542 --> 00:37:04,542
druggy website, and this guy had
posted on it a guy going by the
handle Altoid on 1/27/2011  and

301
00:37:07,083 --> 00:37:14,750
here's  ‑ ‑ well, I don't think
I should have up what he said
but essentially, he was

302
00:37:14,750 --> 00:37:22,250
advertising the Silk Road and he
had these very flavorful word, I
came across this website called

303
00:37:22,250 --> 00:37:28,250
silk road, it acclaims to allow
you to buy and sell anything
online anonymously, I wanted to

304
00:37:34,208 --> 00:37:40,083
see if anyone here had heard of
it or could recommend and it
gave information on how to visit

305
00:37:40,083 --> 00:37:45,375
it. And the way he wrote it, it
sounds more likely
advertisement, but that was the

306
00:37:45,375 --> 00:37:51,375
very first reference they could
find to the silk road on the
Internet. Then on bit coin,

307
00:37:53,500 --> 00:38:00,917
there was someone posting, and
asking about it as well. And
pointing out that Silk Road

308
00:38:00,917 --> 00:38:06,917
exists and seeing if anybody's
actually used it. Then also, bit
coin talk later on he is strike

309
00:38:13,250 --> 00:38:19,250
again, using the name, Altoid,
once again it sounds very much
like an advertisement. Then

310
00:38:26,375 --> 00:38:30,958
later on Altoid on bit coin talk
starting looking for an IP pro
in the bit coin community and

311
00:38:30,958 --> 00:38:36,958
here's what happened, he said
contact me at
Rothubric@gmail.com. So yeah,

312
00:38:44,333 --> 00:38:50,333
that's the first mention of silk
road of they could find in
handling Altoid and to an email

313
00:38:52,792 --> 00:39:00,625
address Ross. So that was pretty
bat. Also, a few other things to
point out, he put his economic

314
00:39:00,625 --> 00:39:06,625
philosophy on sic road and they
had interest in an institute and
Austrian school of economics, so

315
00:39:11,417 --> 00:39:17,792
they had similar interests, sort
of like Jeremy Hammond's
personal life, well, same thing,

316
00:39:17,792 --> 00:39:25,125
and as I said, he was using the
same things that Ross mentions,
so that kind of narrowed it down

317
00:39:25,125 --> 00:39:29,333
to him possibly, that's not
necessarily a firm thing but you
get enough little pieces of

318
00:39:29,333 --> 00:39:35,042
evidence together and you can
get a court order. Also, another
thing he did that is kind of

319
00:39:35,042 --> 00:39:41,042
screwy, the Ross Albrich was
asking for help on HTP code and
he quickly changed his user name

320
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:50,000
but the first one he used was
Ross Albrich, I don't know why
but that's what he did. So guess

321
00:39:55,417 --> 00:40:01,417
what is the main subject of this
point? That's about the
[indiscernible] if I was

322
00:40:05,250 --> 00:40:11,875
[indiscernible]. [ Laughter ] >>
What is it, $1.2  billion. And
the FBI takes notice. Somebody

323
00:40:11,875 --> 00:40:17,875
who is connecting to a website
and they found a hidden login
from gmail, it becomes a death

324
00:40:29,833 --> 00:40:35,958
by a thousand paper cuts
essentially, he had the IP of
silk road was attached to a VPN

325
00:40:35,958 --> 00:40:42,042
server that was connected to an
Internet cafe in San Francisco
where he had connected it to his

326
00:40:42,042 --> 00:40:47,583
Gmail account before. There was
a site that was some sort of
experimental IP address. This is

327
00:40:47,583 --> 00:40:51,792
kind of fairly common on so web
applications and you type in the
right things and it brings up

328
00:40:51,792 --> 00:40:57,792
the standard optimization and
the IP address belonged to the
VPN. Eventually though, the FBI

329
00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:07,792
was able to find some servers
and start getting hard drive
images of him. How they caught

330
00:41:07,792 --> 00:41:13,792
him initially I'm not sure, I
don't knew if they used a bug or
exploited the box there's a

331
00:41:19,958 --> 00:41:25,500
story read about someone
contacting Ross about wanting to
tell a whole bunch of cocaine I

332
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:31,417
believe it was and Ross
[indiscernible] former admin.s
and employees and the employee

333
00:41:31,417 --> 00:41:35,500
was going to buy it but he
bought it at his own house and
the FBI was able to land him on

334
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:41,500
his own house so now they have
someone who works for the silk
road, they may have just

335
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:49,417
followed where the drugs went,
oh, you work for Silk Road and
you work for us now and they got

336
00:41:49,417 --> 00:41:56,833
hard drive images and were able
to start monitoring, and another
big problem, let me see if I

337
00:41:56,833 --> 00:42:01,833
have it on here. I didn't update
this slide, I don't think.
Another problem they ended up

338
00:42:01,833 --> 00:42:07,833
having is he had order a bunch
of fake IDs, and these got
intercepted coming across the

339
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:15,125
border, they all had his picture
objecting it. Homeland security
found these and they went to go

340
00:42:15,125 --> 00:42:21,000
talk that him and he denied
having order them, I see a lot
of documentaries on people

341
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:25,833
escaping prosecution and
generally denying anything is a
good call, the next thing he did

342
00:42:25,833 --> 00:42:31,833
I don't understand though, that
denying thing was okay, but he
was said that hypothetically

343
00:42:34,208 --> 00:42:40,458
anyone could go on to a website
named silk road on tour and
purchase any drugs or fake

344
00:42:40,458 --> 00:42:46,292
identity documents the person
wanted. Why in the hell wouldn't
you say that? But that the that

345
00:42:46,292 --> 00:42:51,500
the brought him back to him and
the roommates when the people
showed up, the home security

346
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:57,500
folks, knew him as Josh and not
his real name, and also fake IDs
with your face on them, what

347
00:42:59,583 --> 00:43:07,458
reason would other people have
to buy those? Also, one of the
servers this they ended up

348
00:43:07,458 --> 00:43:14,708
getting control over it had
frosty, and he's used frosty
before as a handle, and

349
00:43:14,708 --> 00:43:19,292
eventually, they took down the
site and landed a library and
they got his password on his lap

350
00:43:19,292 --> 00:43:25,292
tap. In these particular Anson
did a great write‑ up, and they
did a lot of best courtroom

351
00:43:31,167 --> 00:43:38,917
document stuff I've read.
Lessons learned keep online
identities separate, if he had

352
00:43:38,917 --> 00:43:43,958
kept his interests to himself
that would have helped and if he
hadn't used tour in the same

353
00:43:43,958 --> 00:43:49,958
location he logged into his
gmail that would help also, and
not using the same handle in

354
00:43:53,458 --> 00:44:00,750
multiple places don't have
information, I have no idea why
he said you could buy this on

355
00:44:00,750 --> 00:44:05,708
Silk Road. I have a little bit
of time for some demo, let me
illustrate some of the things I

356
00:44:05,708 --> 00:44:11,708
was mentioning about possible
ways of deanonomizing people.
Let's say you are using tour and

357
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:29,333
in try to convince you hey, go
to this one particular website
and download this Word document.

358
00:44:29,333 --> 00:44:33,000
It's after safe and good, go
ahead and do that. Well,
depending on how you're browser

359
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:38,667
is he tell up, it may not
respect the proxy settings. Now,
I'm trying to connect to tour

360
00:44:38,667 --> 00:44:42,375
right here and hopefully it
comes up within a reasonable
amount of time, I should have

361
00:44:42,375 --> 00:44:48,375
had that up earlier already.
Okay. That's up, let's say I
visited this particular site.

362
00:44:53,250 --> 00:44:57,958
Tracking doc and this is a
little Word doc, I've embed an
image in it. John is trying to

363
00:44:57,958 --> 00:45:05,750
show me a better way to do this.
I'm dining all of the tour
browser, I've got the Word

364
00:45:05,750 --> 00:45:11,750
document I'm going to open it.
And it's a trap, yes, it's a
trap. And hi there, image, yes,

365
00:45:16,875 --> 00:45:24,250
I need to register, I know I'm
sorry Microsoft. Hi there, and
now I send you to a certain page

366
00:45:24,250 --> 00:45:30,250
I have set up for tracking, let
me see if I can find real quick.
Yeah, let that password real

367
00:45:36,917 --> 00:45:42,917
quick. I notice I now have the
IP address, the real IP address
of whoever is accessing, I

368
00:45:45,083 --> 00:45:51,625
think. I hope it's one of their
IP addresses. Anyway, that's
hopefully what I got right there

369
00:45:51,625 --> 00:45:57,625
and I can do a correlation pack,
over tour versus this. Another
option that way, more

370
00:45:59,750 --> 00:46:04,625
professional than my little
ghetto doc file is something
called  ‑ ‑ I'll get to it in a

371
00:46:04,625 --> 00:46:10,625
second. Honey docs and my
friend, Kerry runs it, and I
made a bunch of fake documents,

372
00:46:19,625 --> 00:46:25,625
I'm calling this one credit
card.zip and if it downloads it
gives you Excel files and Word

373
00:46:27,750 --> 00:46:33,750
docs, so I'm going to switch
over screen where it is, and I
can go in and see who opened it

374
00:46:37,667 --> 00:46:43,667
with their real world IP address
except it's probably logging out
by now. Everybody close your

375
00:46:51,625 --> 00:46:57,625
eyes. Let's see. Not that long a
password, you all can guess it.
And remember it. I feel bold! Do

376
00:47:06,833 --> 00:47:12,833
your thing. Okay. And there are
various people who have accessed
it. I asked people to access it

377
00:47:17,250 --> 00:47:21,417
over tour, that should probably
IP address. How much time have I
got now? 5 minutes. Okay. If I

378
00:47:21,417 --> 00:47:27,417
were to open this up and look at
the documents in it, I would
basically get more of the same

379
00:47:33,958 --> 00:47:40,833
thing, so you see OT like open
the document and a few other
formats but you get the idea,

380
00:47:40,833 --> 00:47:43,958
basically I'm marketing this
tool as a much more professional
way of doing it than what I had

381
00:47:43,958 --> 00:47:51,292
before. But I can also do those
things like where I showed with
the log, I can go down  ‑ ‑

382
00:47:51,292 --> 00:47:59,125
another thing that you can do to
mess around with people, I have
an IP service set up, at this

383
00:47:59,125 --> 00:48:05,792
location, so this could be a
condition to see how can hack my
site first. Right here, this is

384
00:48:05,792 --> 00:48:11,792
Tilde it's a vulnerable script
and in find it very very easy to
write deliberately vulnerable

385
00:48:14,042 --> 00:48:21,167
PHP code, currently it's taken
over by Jeremy Brewer, a better
coder than me, but if the

386
00:48:21,167 --> 00:48:25,167
website has vulnerable, there
are attacks you can do. I'll
show you a few of them right

387
00:48:25,167 --> 00:48:32,833
now. I'm going to describe this
one because of time. I'm doing
this one in command injection

388
00:48:32,833 --> 00:48:38,000
attack and trying to get the IP
address, I could sit there
through my connection and see

389
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:44,708
who is actually pinging me to
figure out who they are. Another
option might be  ‑ ‑ yeah, tour

390
00:48:44,708 --> 00:48:50,708
is acting way, way slow in here
right now. Lets me see. Open.
I'm looking for direct object

391
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:03,958
references and I'm opening that
one, too. So this demo may not
work, I have videos of this

392
00:49:03,958 --> 00:49:10,083
online, essentially what I'm
doing is using a vulnerability
injection, I can have it trace

393
00:49:10,083 --> 00:49:15,167
the route to me and see the IP
addresses along the path and
hopefully figure out who someone

394
00:49:15,167 --> 00:49:21,167
is. However, tour on this
network is running pathetically
slow. Believe it or not, I did

395
00:49:24,667 --> 00:49:30,292
it earlier, but the idea is you
do a command injection, you can
get that remote box to contact

396
00:49:30,292 --> 00:49:36,292
you back and if anybody really
wants to see it, I've got about
3 minutes, don't I? 2 minutes.

397
00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:46,500
Oh, questions, yes? >> [Off
mic]. >> This is a VPN server,
it's not like a VPN turn them, I

398
00:49:48,958 --> 00:49:54,958
would get the IP or the VNP, it
might get me close but it
wouldn't be instantaneous. Yes?

399
00:50:05,583 --> 00:50:13,292
>> [Off mic]. >> Shhhhh maybe,
but I haven't really looked into
it. In VIPS maybe, I know

400
00:50:13,292 --> 00:50:16,375
there's some control you can do
over which nodes you hop
through, yeah, it looks like my

401
00:50:16,375 --> 00:50:23,042
tour connection is not doing
that well. If anybody wants to
see this, I have videos on the

402
00:50:23,042 --> 00:50:28,083
website about how to did this,
but you're injecting this and
making the control box contact

403
00:50:28,083 --> 00:50:35,958
you back. You can also have it
suck up files from another Word
site you control and have it

404
00:50:35,958 --> 00:50:41,958
delivered that way as well. And
I have had videos in the past
working. Unfortunately, I am out

405
00:50:44,042 --> 00:50:50,167
of time and tour is going very
slow for me. I thank you for
your time and if you have any

406
00:50:50,167 --> 00:50:54,917
questions, I am around.
[Applause] >> Thank you. Yeah, I
tested all of those demos before

407
00:50:54,917 --> 00:50:58,167
and they were working earlier
but something is happening right
now.
