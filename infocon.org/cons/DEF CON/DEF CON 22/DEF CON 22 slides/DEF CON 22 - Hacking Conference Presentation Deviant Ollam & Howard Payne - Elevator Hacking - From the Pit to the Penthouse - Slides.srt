1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,667
>>All right. DEF CON 22,
elevator hacking. I'm blown away
people are in here ROOTH now

2
00:00:07,667 --> 00:00:13,667
listening to us. We love you
too. And we love that DEF CON
allowed us to do this, even

3
00:00:20,708 --> 00:00:26,667
though we were told it had to be
the last talk on the last day.
'Cause you know, breaking

4
00:00:26,667 --> 00:00:31,583
things. So why are we here? What
are we talking about? Why do we
do this? Some of you know me.

5
00:00:31,583 --> 00:00:37,750
I'm deviant. I own a pen testing
FRM. We break into buildings. We
do the physical side, many

6
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:41,833
buildings, leverage their
elevators as part of the
security model. They should not

7
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:47,375
do that. >>	My name's Howard.
I'm not here representing pain
elevators despite the name. And

8
00:00:47,375 --> 00:00:53,917
I do have an employer who's
views and opinions I do not
express.   ‑ ‑ I drink bourbon,

9
00:00:53,917 --> 00:00:59,917
he drinks cheep beer. There are
a lot of thing that is can go
wrong with elevator hacking.

10
00:01:03,208 --> 00:01:09,208
Elevators are regarded as the
safest form of travel, based on
miles traveled. They virtually

11
00:01:16,292 --> 00:01:22,250
always work the bay they're
expected to. Most people have
never been injured by an

12
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:26,875
elevator. Probably entrapped but
not injured. ‑ ‑ or shaft way.
The machine room and the pit.

13
00:01:26,875 --> 00:01:32,333
For guys like me. You can do
really bad things to yourself
with an elevator if you're a

14
00:01:32,333 --> 00:01:38,292
jack wagon. That leg was saved
though. >>	Yeah this leg was
survived. Our concern is not

15
00:01:38,292 --> 00:01:41,375
that you're dumb enough to quill
yourselves, but that you're
going to breakshit. Dumb enough

16
00:01:41,375 --> 00:01:47,375
to kill yourselves. So yeah,
elevator  ‑ ‑ the escalator
helicopter on YouTube. It's all

17
00:01:54,833 --> 00:02:00,833
fun until you cause a felony
criminal mischief. Thousands of
dollars in damage.

18
00:02:04,292 --> 00:02:10,292
(Indiscernible) criminal
penalty. Don't do that. In
general, like you're going to

19
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:18,583
look at elevators differently
after this talk. You're going to
spot little things in elevators.

20
00:02:18,583 --> 00:02:23,250
They'll tell you, if she doesn't
want to be touched don't touch
her. Leave it alone F. You don't

21
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:29,375
know what something is, do not
turnkey, don't do it. We're
professionals. I'm just up here

22
00:02:29,375 --> 00:02:35,708
talking silly. The things you
see in this talk, we want you to
learn, we don't want you to try

23
00:02:35,708 --> 00:02:39,625
all of it unless you have a
really good scoping document
that legal prepared. So

24
00:02:39,625 --> 00:02:45,625
elevators broadly speaking fall
into two types of categories.
Some are hydraulic, piston

25
00:02:48,458 --> 00:02:54,458
driven by below. And rote
traction. There are steel
cables.   ‑ ‑   ‑ ‑ and it's

26
00:03:01,333 --> 00:03:07,333
gaining traction on the ropes
and moving the cab and the
counterweight system. So

27
00:03:11,333 --> 00:03:17,333
elevators generally ride on two
rails with guide rollers like
this that you're seeing in this

28
00:03:20,167 --> 00:03:24,125
slide. They're not anchored [N.]
Sometimes you'll see shoes
instead of rolers like THSHGS

29
00:03:24,125 --> 00:03:29,000
but the principle is the
elevator is just guided up and
down on these rails. The lifting

30
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,833
mechanism is just doing the
work, this is just the way it's
guided smoothly. Just think of

31
00:03:33,833 --> 00:03:38,542
it as sliding up and down a
track. Most people in this room,
their interaction to elevators

32
00:03:38,542 --> 00:03:44,542
is fixtures. Like you see here.
Most people is a car operating
panel. When you push a button,

33
00:03:47,667 --> 00:03:51,917
you're doing what's registering
a cab call. You're telling the
elevator contactually where you

34
00:03:51,917 --> 00:03:57,125
want to go. Opposed to when
you're in a hallway, you press
the up and down button. That's

35
00:03:57,125 --> 00:04:03,125
called a hall call. There's
direction indicators that keep
you from being a jack wagon  ‑ ‑

36
00:04:07,167 --> 00:04:13,500
  ‑ ‑ please don't do that.
>>	But again, all the power is
coming from the motor room above

37
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:19,500
or below. So what you're seeing
here is gear lifts tractions. I
believe these are DC powered.

38
00:04:21,833 --> 00:04:29,333
They are usually used in higher
rised buildings to achieve the
speed that's necessary to travel

39
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:35,333
effectively inside a high‑ rise.
On the other end of a spectrum,
you'll see motors that look like

40
00:04:38,417 --> 00:04:46,417
this. This is hydraulic. This is
a very simple system. There's a
programmer on the right side and

41
00:04:46,417 --> 00:04:51,583
there's a hydraulic pump which
lift it is elevators, you're
never going to see hydros taller

42
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:56,958
than eight stories. >>	No that
was actually a Dover hydraulic
HIGH (indiscernible). >>	So he

43
00:04:56,958 --> 00:05:02,792
mention it had controller on the
wall. This is the brain of the
entire unit. So what you're

44
00:05:02,792 --> 00:05:06,083
going to learn throughout this
talk is elevatorses have
varieties of sensors that  ‑ ‑  

45
00:05:06,083 --> 00:05:10,333
‑ ‑ current position whether the
door's open or closed. A myriad.
‑ ‑ so we hope you don't mind

46
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:15,292
we're chattering through. The if
you're (indiscernible) and you
want to learn this stuff,

47
00:05:15,292 --> 00:05:21,292
download the slides later. But
we want to show you keys and
stuff. So one. >>	One of the

48
00:05:35,375 --> 00:05:41,375
most primitive forms of input is
the limit switch. That's the top
and bottom of the voice wagon.

49
00:05:46,958 --> 00:05:51,083
>>	And they're there to indicate
when the elevator is reaching
the end of its rung. The fourth

50
00:05:51,083 --> 00:05:57,083
roller mounted on that. As the
elevator is approaching the |top
floor, it'll trip the first slow

51
00:06:01,625 --> 00:06:04,792
down  ‑ ‑   ‑ ‑ the Ped speed of
the motor until it hit that is
third one, which is called the

52
00:06:04,792 --> 00:06:12,333
normal limit. When the
elevator's on the normal limit,
it's levelled on the |top floor.

53
00:06:12,333 --> 00:06:18,917
So now you're probably WOND
(speaking simultaneously).
>>	That's to basically indicate

54
00:06:18,917 --> 00:06:22,625
when the elevator's about to run
off the rails. There's literally
New Orleans for it to go.

55
00:06:22,625 --> 00:06:30,167
>>	Yeah if if the elevator hit
that, it's not an easy fix.
Although we saw people trying to

56
00:06:30,167 --> 00:06:36,167
do that in a mall. >>	This is a
device that's called a motor
encoder. It also spins the

57
00:06:43,833 --> 00:06:49,750
indicator of the motor encoder
which allows the  ‑ ‑
resolutions it's made in a

58
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:55,083
certain amount of time. It will
then be able to determine how
fast it should travel. It'll

59
00:06:55,083 --> 00:07:00,958
match it up with other types of
information. Such as. >>	The
position indicator, the elevator

60
00:07:00,958 --> 00:07:06,125
on the hoist way is magnetically
or on the means actually telling
where it is on the hoist way.

61
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:12,292
It's a really funny freak out of
where it happens. If the
elevator gets lost  ‑ ‑ relearn

62
00:07:12,292 --> 00:07:18,500
where it went wrong so if you've
ever been in an elevator that
didn't go you were going. And

63
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:23,708
went all the way up and down.
And you're like okay, it was
not, it didn't match up with

64
00:07:23,708 --> 00:07:29,625
what the controller thought. So
all these inputs come together
and if the inputs don't match,

65
00:07:29,625 --> 00:07:35,208
if the elevator panics, it'll
hit the breaks and all kinds of
things. So there are driving

66
00:07:35,208 --> 00:07:40,000
machine breaks which is sort of
the normal breaks that when the
elevator is at rest, the breaks

67
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,667
will be applied. When the
elevator's moving, the breaks
will be dropped. There are other

68
00:07:44,667 --> 00:07:50,583
types of breaks. The safety.
People probably heard a elevator
can't free fall. That's

69
00:07:50,583 --> 00:07:55,542
generally true. Devices like
this on the left, it's something
called a governor. And it's a

70
00:07:55,542 --> 00:08:00,542
(indiscernible) device as the
elevator speeds up, that fly
wheel will spin faster and

71
00:08:00,542 --> 00:08:06,833
faster and eventually jaws will
fly out and trip and grab the
governor rope. That will stop

72
00:08:06,833 --> 00:08:11,333
the car. F the other device is
called a rope where I happener.
Unexpected upward movement.

73
00:08:11,333 --> 00:08:17,333
People are afraid the elevator's
free fall you should be afraid
that it falls up. Because the

74
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:26,125
counterweight  ‑ ‑ >>	And didn't
stop and it crashed into the
over head. >>	Yes, I believe it

75
00:08:28,667 --> 00:08:35,042
was from which I lay. This would
have stopped that. Chile. >>	Is
understand that these mechanisms

76
00:08:35,042 --> 00:08:42,417
are easy to really just figure
out. You can see how they work
and you can see that they're

77
00:08:42,417 --> 00:08:48,167
really safe. This is a demo of
one of the rail gripper safety
mechanism. This is what made

78
00:08:48,167 --> 00:08:54,167
Otis famous  ‑ ‑ He's being
hoisted very, very high and then
just cutting the rope. This man

79
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:09,500
doesn't fall. The cab is fine.
Yeah. And that was a demo that
Otis would do at world fairs.

80
00:09:11,542 --> 00:09:15,458
Because until he came along,
elevatorses were unsafe. But
nowadays they're very, very

81
00:09:15,458 --> 00:09:21,750
safe. >>	The principle behind
the elevator existed the last
2000  years. But there was no

82
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:28,917
way to be safe. >>	Your modern
system that you saw earlier with
the governor and UCH is, there

83
00:09:28,917 --> 00:09:34,833
are separate ropes as we called
them. There are [metal cables.
There are separate roping

84
00:09:34,833 --> 00:09:41,125
condition systems traveling with
the car at all times, if that
governor jams and grabs, it'll

85
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:47,792
DWAL pull up on breaking gripper
levels and plant levers. There's
all kinds of break shoes that

86
00:09:47,792 --> 00:09:55,625
keep you from dying F. All else
fails, the pit has buffers in it
too. And the breaks don't work,

87
00:09:55,625 --> 00:10:00,125
if you're sliding through the
breaks, the pit will have spring
or oil piston buffers designed

88
00:10:00,125 --> 00:10:05,917
to| absorb the full weight of
the car at full travel speed.
>>	You probably won't die, very

89
00:10:05,917 --> 00:10:11,625
seriously injured, but you won't
die. >>	Yeah you'll be back next
year. So elevatorses do the job

90
00:10:11,625 --> 00:10:17,625
really well on that mode if
you're riding in the elevator.
If you're not, this is where

91
00:10:21,625 --> 00:10:27,625
elevatorses get unsafe. When
you're riding like
(indiscernible) in the car.

92
00:10:34,042 --> 00:10:40,042
>>	Turn that light on.
(Inaudible) Lee him. >>	I mean
people have done this. People

93
00:10:54,625 --> 00:11:00,625
used to call it elevator
(inaudible). >>	Yeah don't be
that guy right? . Sadly though

94
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:12,417
that is a way elevator
(inaudible) have been fatally
injured in the past. We're not

95
00:11:12,417 --> 00:11:18,542
kidding. Don't do this. >>	But
in you're in the car on
automatic operation, the

96
00:11:18,542 --> 00:11:22,292
elevator's going to keep you
very safe. Would you like to
learn about nonautomatic

97
00:11:22,292 --> 00:11:28,292
application? >>	 (Applause.)
>>	The most common thing I use
as a pen tester on jobs [S] flip

98
00:11:30,583 --> 00:11:35,875
an elevator out of group service
and into independent service.
When you register a hall call

99
00:11:35,875 --> 00:11:40,083
and you have a bank of
elevators, they don't all come
to your floor. The controller

100
00:11:40,083 --> 00:11:45,958
chooses one and dispatches that
to you because they're in group
operation. If you take that

101
00:11:45,958 --> 00:11:50,458
elevator up, the controller
knows I can't use that for a
while. An elevator in

102
00:11:50,458 --> 00:11:56,625
independent service as we see in
independent key switch here,
sometimes they're toggle

103
00:11:56,625 --> 00:12:02,250
switches hidden behind panels.
There's a lot of hidden panels.
If you flip to independent

104
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:07,250
service mode, the elevator
becomes yours. It ignores all
the haul calls everything but

105
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:11,208
what we're telling it. That
includes opening the doors if
you drive to a floor, you have

106
00:12:11,208 --> 00:12:17,208
to manually say, open door, or
close door. I have hidden in
target buildings for hours just

107
00:12:25,875 --> 00:12:29,417
on independent service because
it's not going anywhere. People
could call the elevators all

108
00:12:29,417 --> 00:12:36,583
day. No one ever notices how
come elevator passenger seven
hadn't been responding. No, you

109
00:12:36,583 --> 00:12:42,667
just get on the first one you
come TOCHLT I wield an office
chair in an elevator once and

110
00:12:42,667 --> 00:12:49,458
sat there and waiting until
everybody went home. And we
rocked house all over data

111
00:12:49,458 --> 00:12:54,833
center. So yeah, independent
service is really useful if
you're a pen tester. Because it

112
00:12:54,833 --> 00:12:59,125
takes the elevator completely
out of the group and gives it
just to you. It becomes your

113
00:12:59,125 --> 00:13:04,708
elevator. So there's a.
>>	Similar mode called
attendance service and it has

114
00:13:04,708 --> 00:13:10,958
its root in the history. Where
there actually was an attendant
who would drive the cab up or

115
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:16,000
down using a hand crank like
here. So on an automatic system,
you'd see something like this

116
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:22,458
behind a lock panel. There are
up and down controls to allow
the attendant to signal that the

117
00:13:22,458 --> 00:13:29,083
presidents to reverse direction.
So they might have a cab full of
people or VIP and they decide

118
00:13:29,083 --> 00:13:34,917
let's stop collecting all the
calls in this direction and get
these people [wherever they need

119
00:13:34,917 --> 00:13:40,417
to go. And then that bypass
button, sometimes it's called
the nonstop button, that allows

120
00:13:40,417 --> 00:13:46,375
the attendant to continue in the
same direction with the phone
car and skip all the calls. When

121
00:13:46,375 --> 00:13:54,000
he's done, all of those haul
calls are still registered. So
eventually it'll pick up those

122
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,083
passengers that are waiting.
It's just a wait to signal that
the cab is full or whatever.

123
00:13:58,083 --> 00:14:04,375
>>	It's like the close door hack
which doesn't fuck]ing work. So
everyone should stop repeating

124
00:14:04,375 --> 00:14:11,792
that all the time. >>	Except
there's that one kind of. >>	Ask
us about like, ask us about

125
00:14:11,792 --> 00:14:17,250
really logic controllers which
how. >>	We think the origin of
that was independent. Somebody

126
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:23,583
saw an elevator where the
operator was holding door close
to  ‑ ‑ 'cause you have to on

127
00:14:23,583 --> 00:14:29,583
independent mode. And it's like
oh wow, you see what that guy
did? I'll do that later? No you

128
00:14:33,458 --> 00:14:39,458
won't. Unless you have a key
switch. What if you don't want
to have a high prior to service

129
00:15:04,292 --> 00:15:10,292
but don't want to hire  ‑ ‑ As
fast as possible. And what
happens when the VIP's being

130
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:23,750
served? In particular, it's
funny if you ever see this used 
‑ ‑ going up going down. And if

131
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:30,542
an executive puts their key in,
it says this elevator is needed
for other reasons. Please exit

132
00:15:30,542 --> 00:15:36,000
the door immediately upon
opening. And it kicks you out of
the elevator. >>	Maybe if you're

133
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:42,000
the type of person whose seen
interesting communities and
their beliefs and other things,

134
00:15:45,417 --> 00:15:51,833
your maybe familiar with Sabbath
mode. Or you saw a movie with
bill March religiously. It is

135
00:15:51,833 --> 00:15:57,833
for people who believe they're
not allowed to interact with
certain systems which toggles

136
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:06,375
Sabbath mode let's people get
around the billing by driving
all the way to the top floor and

137
00:16:06,375 --> 00:16:12,375
platforming automatically on
every single floor on the way
down. It's kind of like hacking

138
00:16:15,875 --> 00:16:21,875
god I guess. Ah, I found a
loophole in scripture. So I'm
smarter than you. So that's

139
00:16:23,917 --> 00:16:28,708
Sabbath service. A lot of other
there's a Sabbath mode there.
Ask us later about why it

140
00:16:28,708 --> 00:16:36,542
doesn't exactly do what some
people think it does. And SAB
some religious colors need to

141
00:16:36,542 --> 00:16:42,542
double check their notes.
Collars. Load by pass. Holy
shit. Elevators know how heavy

142
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:52,875
they are. You put too much shit
in the elevator once and they
beeped at you and got angry.

143
00:16:52,875 --> 00:16:59,208
They can use that data to say
hum, I'm collecting all these
calls and I'm pretty full. I

144
00:16:59,208 --> 00:17:03,167
should not fuck]ing stop at a
bunch of other floors right now
because it's going to be a bunch

145
00:17:03,167 --> 00:17:09,167
of this. Sorry no room. Sorry no
room. For like five more floors.
Yeah. Hope if you come to like

146
00:17:11,417 --> 00:17:17,167
the hope in New York, why this
isn't enabled more often is
beyond me. Why antinuance is not

147
00:17:17,167 --> 00:17:24,708
enabled. If you're a frickin'
derby bush and like the press
all buttons  ‑ ‑ >>	More calls.

148
00:17:24,708 --> 00:17:30,708
Keep going. Wait hold on. Boom,
done. (Laughing) that's amazing
keep recording it. So we're

149
00:17:34,542 --> 00:17:41,708
going down, one to 23 and boom.
Out. It's like they know we're
here. >>	Yeah that's called

150
00:17:41,708 --> 00:17:46,542
antinuance mode. There's peak
programming if you're a building
with workers come in the

151
00:17:46,542 --> 00:17:51,875
morning. Check out in a certain
hour. There's all kind of
optimization that you can do and

152
00:17:51,875 --> 00:17:59,000
that's something a confident
elevator consultant can do for
you. There's also if you want to

153
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,708
have like extra] special
considerations when people
shouldn't be coming and going.

154
00:18:02,708 --> 00:18:09,917
>>	I saw a mode at museum and it
was called riot mode. I thought
what the heck is this. The

155
00:18:09,917 --> 00:18:17,792
building owners wanted a way,
they could lock the ground floor
out of the elevator system but

156
00:18:17,792 --> 00:18:23,625
still use it to access the other
floors. So again, somebody in
the security room would hit a

157
00:18:23,625 --> 00:18:31,083
button and say oh gosh, there's
a riot happening outside.
>>	Occupy (inaudible). >>	So it

158
00:18:31,083 --> 00:18:35,667
would just stop responding to
the ground floor WAUZ if
somebody was able to get in on

159
00:18:35,667 --> 00:18:40,583
the ground level, they could get
on an elevator and do bad
things. >>	The basic part of the

160
00:18:40,583 --> 00:18:46,583
riot mode, the elevators keep,
WOG on the rest. Why can't the
99  percent be happy with the

161
00:18:49,458 --> 00:18:55,458
scraps we give them. You don't
care you just can't go to the
lobby. So also decide SIFK

162
00:18:58,208 --> 00:19:04,708
unrest there's also seismic
unrest. And you may never have
seen this. Or you might live in

163
00:19:04,708 --> 00:19:09,042
southern California where
there's a little jewel on the
elevator sometimes that says

164
00:19:09,042 --> 00:19:16,958
seismic. It's going to cause an
earthquake when you push it. No,
there's this indicator that  ‑ ‑

165
00:19:16,958 --> 00:19:22,125
  ‑ ‑ you should exit the cab as
soon as possible. So a lot of
tiles it's very simple

166
00:19:22,125 --> 00:19:26,792
mechanical that might be a
(indiscernible) on a string as
you call it. There's a [metal

167
00:19:26,792 --> 00:19:31,667
cable running up ask down. And
if the cab starts swinging side
to side, that ring might come in

168
00:19:31,667 --> 00:19:37,167
contact completing a circuit
indicating to the controller
that unexpected lateral movement

169
00:19:37,167 --> 00:19:43,458
is occurring. It's the one kind
of emergency mode that might
actually take you up. So it's a

170
00:19:43,458 --> 00:19:47,875
little counterintuitive. But if
you think about it, what can
happen, one of the risks during

171
00:19:47,875 --> 00:19:53,750
an earthquake, if the cab or the
counterweight actually becomes
displaced from the rail that is

172
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:59,667
(indiscernible) to guiding it.
You got a 2,503,000‑ pound  ‑ ‑
>>	(Inaudible) with you.

173
00:19:59,667 --> 00:20:04,875
>>	Yeah, so it moves you aWA
from the counterweight.
(Inaudible) collection. >>	How

174
00:20:04,875 --> 00:20:08,750
many people maybe work in a
hospital or medical facility,
you may have seen code [blue

175
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:15,792
service. Right on. That's
medical [prior to .Imagine| the
highest VIP priority the  ‑ ‑

176
00:20:15,792 --> 00:20:21,792
the closest one responds and it
becomes their elevator until the
key comes back down. Hospital

177
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:31,500
also has code pink. It's baby
theft mode.   ‑ ‑   ‑ ‑
unauthorized, the elevators can

178
00:20:35,292 --> 00:20:39,875
basically turn into security
recall devices which is its own
mode that you can program

179
00:20:39,875 --> 00:20:44,833
independent of a hospital. It
turns the elevator into a man
trap. It'll deliver the person

180
00:20:44,833 --> 00:20:48,958
to a familiar of your
designation. And keep the doors
shut. Or it'll psych it will

181
00:20:48,958 --> 00:20:55,458
doors manually so they can't
hide. There's all kinds of
fascinating things you can do

182
00:20:55,458 --> 00:20:59,458
with elevator security and
there's other things people try
to do and we're going to shit

183
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:04,458
all over that in a minute.
There's also just modes you see,
if you start looking into this,

184
00:21:04,458 --> 00:21:09,833
you'll see security service.
This is kind of a catch all key
switch. It doesn't always mean

185
00:21:09,833 --> 00:21:14,083
what you think. Like all the key
switches in this photoare
actually the same (inaudible).

186
00:21:14,083 --> 00:21:19,333
Look at one of them that the
security service looks beat to
hell. So I asked the desk at

187
00:21:19,333 --> 00:21:25,292
this hotel, hay, I work with
elevators, I'm curious, are you
having security incidents every

188
00:21:25,292 --> 00:21:32,042
frickin' day? And he's like no.
The maid use that to go to the
basement. Just 'cause use see

189
00:21:32,042 --> 00:21:38,542
something, it doesn't actually
do what you think it does. One
of the most misunderstood modes

190
00:21:38,542 --> 00:21:43,000
is firefighters emergency
operation. You're seeing here
two key switches that are

191
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:48,667
instrumental in the use of an
elevator during a fire. When the
heat or smoke condition is

192
00:21:48,667 --> 00:21:53,792
detected by the buildings's fire
alarm system there are contact
that is  ‑ ‑   ‑ ‑ controller

193
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:59,375
which indicates that there is
such a condition and that it's
no longer safe to run the

194
00:21:59,375 --> 00:22:02,458
elevators. You've probably seen
signs. They're supposed to be at
every landing. That say  ‑ ‑

195
00:22:02,458 --> 00:22:09,125
>>	You shouldn't be able to. The
elevator should go away from you
and sit] in the lobby. It

196
00:22:09,125 --> 00:22:15,500
should. >>	But the smokes and
heats  ‑ ‑   ‑ ‑ so the building
can be in fire down there, and

197
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:22,583
the elevator over there is still
working SDWL but if the elevator
has platformed in the lobby, the

198
00:22:22,583 --> 00:22:27,875
firefighter can take control of
it. And they can drive it in the
building and in a very powerful

199
00:22:27,875 --> 00:22:34,583
way. >>	Just to be clear, phase
one is when the smoke and heat
detecters go off. It brings the

200
00:22:34,583 --> 00:22:38,917
elevators down to the lobby or
some other designated floor  ‑ ‑
  ‑ ‑ once the car is on phase

201
00:22:38,917 --> 00:22:46,542
one, then they can go in and use
their key to activate phase two
which allows them to run the

202
00:22:46,542 --> 00:22:53,500
car. Over riding the fact that
this other is logged out.
>>	Over riding is pretty much

203
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:59,083
everything. You think
independent mode is powerful?
Firefighter phase is way more

204
00:22:59,083 --> 00:23:04,250
powerful. Fuck] you, I'm a
firefighter. >>	By code it has
to be disabling any security

205
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:11,833
systems. So that firefighters
can get to the floor they need
to go to. So there's one more

206
00:23:11,833 --> 00:23:17,375
mode that's ehn more powerful
than this. In the elevator
world, who can ever be more

207
00:23:17,375 --> 00:23:23,458
important than a firefighter?
>>	Us. (Laughing) . >>	Yeah,
elevator guys right? . So

208
00:23:23,458 --> 00:23:29,542
(indiscernible) inspection, if
you can take command of the
elevator and get into the hoist

209
00:23:29,542 --> 00:23:34,458
way, which is superfuck]ing
dangerous. If you don't know
what you're doing, don't god dam

210
00:23:34,458 --> 00:23:41,542
do this. If you do, there are
all kinds of controls in there,
you should not have anything to

211
00:23:41,542 --> 00:23:46,667
do with because you don't know
what they are. >>	Exactly. >>	Oh
my God, you'll see something

212
00:23:46,667 --> 00:23:50,833
about that later maybe. So
plenty of buildings, try to use
elevators adds part of their

213
00:23:50,833 --> 00:23:55,458
security model. Maybe you seen a
building where you can't
register a haul call. Or you

214
00:23:55,458 --> 00:24:02,792
have to use a key. Maybe there's
no haul buttons, there's only a
key switch. Maybe you've been in

215
00:24:02,792 --> 00:24:08,917
situations where a badge reader
is used or hotel key card is
used. So not being able to make

216
00:24:08,917 --> 00:24:13,875
the elevator come to you and you
can drive it layer, we'll show
you an interesting trick about

217
00:24:13,875 --> 00:24:18,958
that. Maybe there have been
situations where you can get in
the elevator and certain floors

218
00:24:18,958 --> 00:24:23,958
are locked out. WHABD of locks
are these? Anybody who's been in
the lock (inaudible).

219
00:24:23,958 --> 00:24:28,375
(Indiscernible) locks are shit
ones. Those are valid answers.
(Indiscernible) key switches,

220
00:24:28,375 --> 00:24:35,792
almost all of them are way for
lock. Some of them are harder I
think. But you can pick them

221
00:24:35,792 --> 00:24:42,667
later if you want. This is not a
way for lock. That is a medical
lock. I'm very interested on

222
00:24:42,667 --> 00:24:48,458
floor seven. But anything like
lock outs or badge systems,
these are common ways that

223
00:24:48,458 --> 00:24:53,708
people try to treat the elevator
as restricting your movement.
They try to say, oh you know,

224
00:24:53,708 --> 00:24:58,792
someone couldn't get to floor
seven or 20, or whatever unless
they have the right credential.

225
00:24:58,792 --> 00:25:04,875
Duck FAUK bunch of that. That's
not how you should think of your
elevator. You want to secure a

226
00:25:04,875 --> 00:25:10,292
elevator? This is what your
doing. What's going on here.
>>	Sure. We had a job WOUN time

227
00:25:10,292 --> 00:25:14,958
in a facility and we came across
this. I said gee, THS a
interesting way to secure a

228
00:25:14,958 --> 00:25:20,958
hallway. (Indiscernible) this
key. Let's just show them. >>	It
was a jail. It's a giant cage in

229
00:25:24,417 --> 00:25:31,125
front of the elevator. Unless
you're doing this, think of your
elevators as a stairwell. Think

230
00:25:31,125 --> 00:25:37,083
of them as a stair way where
lazy people don't use their
legs. Everything we just showed

231
00:25:37,083 --> 00:25:43,375
you we'll just shit all over it.
Remember there was no haul call
buttons, you can't get the

232
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:50,667
elevator to show up, I use my
magic hack (indiscernible)
paper. Well what happened there?

233
00:25:50,667 --> 00:25:55,833
Well the elevator happened to be
at the floor, so somebody
tripped the safety inch. And

234
00:25:55,833 --> 00:25:59,292
it's a really smart idea to
stick things through the hoist
way doors. >>	No it's not.

235
00:25:59,292 --> 00:26:05,292
>>	And also to be clear, that's
not a universal trick. In fact
that's unusual it did work.

236
00:26:07,375 --> 00:26:11,625
Those sensors should have been
disabled when the doors were
closed. But this kid somewhere

237
00:26:11,625 --> 00:26:18,500
on YouTube happened to find out
that it worked. >>	Most of what
we do most of what we're going

238
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:23,000
to talk to you about over riding
systems just by using the key
SWECHs. There's key switches

239
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:30,000
inside all  ‑ ‑ how many people
have seen panels in elevators
that pop open. Some of those

240
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,583
panels are locked. None of you
would have ever picked this.
Interesting point, there's

241
00:26:34,583 --> 00:26:40,583
something call add slam panel.
It's like a spring loaded latch.
You can just. (Making noise.)

242
00:26:45,375 --> 00:26:51,500
And it'll pop open. But inside
the panels, you'll see like look
independent service that we told

243
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:55,667
you about. Hoist way service,
you shouldn't touch it. Card
reader disabled. Let me turn I

244
00:26:55,667 --> 00:27:02,333
don't have my key, let me turn
off my that function. The
industry is oh washed in

245
00:27:02,333 --> 00:27:07,375
different key SWIFs and
different keys that you'll start
to see in the industry they call

246
00:27:07,375 --> 00:27:12,208
it graffiti. In the motor rooms
and car panels, you'll see notes
from elevator guys and gals.

247
00:27:12,208 --> 00:27:19,500
You'll start to think that keys
are really different all over
the place. And yes, there's a

248
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:25,000
lot of keys. If you're on a pen
test job, you might try to look
for the elevator keys. Sometimes

249
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:31,042
you just find them. But if
you're on a legislate elevator
job, what this man has done for

250
00:27:31,042 --> 00:27:37,042
years now is catalog every key
he's ever seen on every job ever
ever. As far as I know, Howard's

251
00:27:43,292 --> 00:27:48,583
the only one that has a
collection of every elevator key
he's found SXN he knows what it

252
00:27:48,583 --> 00:27:54,333
does. This is not Howard's key
collection by the way. This is
Howard's key collection. >>	You

253
00:27:54,333 --> 00:28:00,333
might notice this is actually an
old photo. Every elevator  ‑ ‑
there's all different brands and

254
00:28:08,875 --> 00:28:15,917
fixtures. And you can just spot
them. >>	So when you have the
experience to look at something

255
00:28:15,917 --> 00:28:21,208
and say ah, I've seen that on
another job or I've seen the
catalog or company's flyers and

256
00:28:21,208 --> 00:28:27,208
visited the trade shows. It's
all the same. They use the same
things everywhere. And that is

257
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:34,667
one of the main points to take
away from this. If they sold you
a key switch, the buttons look

258
00:28:34,667 --> 00:28:39,333
away and the key switches look
alike. The buttons looks alike,
hay my elevator uses Adams,

259
00:28:39,333 --> 00:28:45,333
guess what, your key probably
operates that other Adams
elevator. >>	There's modernizing

260
00:28:47,458 --> 00:28:53,458
that that happens. We're in the
Rio right? Dover impulsion. How
many people seen those buttons a

261
00:28:59,125 --> 00:29:05,042
million times. >>	When I started
to try to learn this, I'm on
jobs, I'm like holy shit, I'm

262
00:29:05,042 --> 00:29:11,042
pretty sure I have ooh key for
this. What is it? I'm like I
don't know what it is. How thick

263
00:29:14,167 --> 00:29:19,708
is the halo. What font is  ‑ ‑
they all look the same to you
until you start learning it. And

264
00:29:19,708 --> 00:29:24,917
you can type the fixtures just
by glancing at them and you know
what keys (indiscernible).

265
00:29:24,917 --> 00:29:31,292
>>	That's totally hell vet KA.
>>	Yeah, epiKA. >>	And the other
is innovation. >>	It says it on

266
00:29:31,292 --> 00:29:38,708
the slide. >>	Like an article
narrow I think. >>	I could do
this to him all day. Now if you

267
00:29:38,708 --> 00:29:43,667
want your own elevator keys,
like people sell them online.
Many people probably shouldn't

268
00:29:43,667 --> 00:29:47,958
be and you probably shouldn't
buy them because they're ripping
you off. Like this key set is

269
00:29:47,958 --> 00:29:52,875
almost $9 a key. >>	And its
actually has to ship USB ground
because the smoke isn't the

270
00:29:52,875 --> 00:29:59,750
picture is included. So it's  ‑
‑ I don't know what half these
things are to tell you the

271
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:04,750
truth. They took an KOOEL guy
that retired 20  years ago and
copied every single one, because

272
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:10,250
the fixtures these are used for
are completely dead and long
gone. >>	These are the most

273
00:30:10,250 --> 00:30:18,125
popular ones you can find
online  ‑ ‑ you can get 17 of
them in the set. >>	Don't get me

274
00:30:18,125 --> 00:30:24,125
wrong though. The vendor did two
nice things, they took clear
straight on photos of the keys.

275
00:30:26,917 --> 00:30:31,833
With the labels visible. And
they really took care to make
sure this was going to be

276
00:30:31,833 --> 00:30:36,750
comprehensive. This was really
perfect for your fire department
as long as your fire department

277
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:42,583
simultaneouslies the state of
Massachusetts  ‑ ‑   ‑ ‑ South
Carolina and Arizona. So if.

278
00:30:42,583 --> 00:30:47,833
>>	So if that's what your tricks
are rolling through, that's your
job. Rock out. >>	What probably

279
00:30:47,833 --> 00:30:55,167
happened of course is the vendor
had a contact. And someone kept
handing them keys and say I've

280
00:30:55,167 --> 00:31:01,042
seen this work or this is a
buyer key and they've had, well
we better put it on our set.

281
00:31:01,042 --> 00:31:05,708
>>	So when you buy keys online,
from shitty sources, you don't
know what you're getting

282
00:31:05,708 --> 00:31:10,208
exactly. You might be getting a
key that's speed run on a
duplicator that kind of has the

283
00:31:10,208 --> 00:31:16,208
right biddings vs. a coat cut
and original factory key  ‑ ‑
and going on elevator keys.com.

284
00:31:19,458 --> 00:31:23,292
Is anyone going to sell them in
this room. How many people are
going to try to call elevator

285
00:31:23,292 --> 00:31:30,292
keys now? >>	Don't bother, read
the verification requirements
they will not sell to you unless

286
00:31:30,292 --> 00:31:37,875
you are legitimate  ‑ ‑ >>	The
guy AS I can D. I tried on the
phone a lot. (Laughing) . But in

287
00:31:37,875 --> 00:31:43,333
general, this a industry way
behind the times on security. So
WHOOND of key switch is this on

288
00:31:43,333 --> 00:31:48,958
the floor too? (Inaudible)
you've been to the village.
>>	Tubular. >>	What'd the guy

289
00:31:48,958 --> 00:31:55,333
tell you. >>	This is a true
story and I swear, it was a
casino, and the building's

290
00:31:55,333 --> 00:32:00,708
architect who's [present at a
meeting, he happened to mention
he had a personal investment

291
00:32:00,708 --> 00:32:07,167
(indiscernible) on the elevator.
And he made a comment to the
effect of no one would ever be

292
00:32:07,167 --> 00:32:13,250
able to pick that. >>	That's a
tubular lock. >>	Right. >>	
(Laughing) so yeah, it's an

293
00:32:13,250 --> 00:32:17,917
industry where like someone says
so MEDCO is a great brand. We'll
get tons and tons of MEDCO key

294
00:32:17,917 --> 00:32:23,167
switches. I asked Howard and
said let me see those keys. And
then I grabbed bob ex. And I

295
00:32:23,167 --> 00:32:27,708
lined them all up. It's a
mastered system where half the
biddings aren't even mastered

296
00:32:27,708 --> 00:32:34,000
and the rest is just a huge
sample size I was able to
determine the master fitting. I

297
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:38,542
had Howard once send me a
picture. And it's a Dover
system. Yeah, a Dover DEE R key,

298
00:32:38,542 --> 00:32:46,292
but look where I found it.
There's all kind of reuse in the
industry because you think your

299
00:32:46,292 --> 00:32:51,417
keys are unique, and it's just a
supplier calling a supplier
calling a warehouse and shipping

300
00:32:51,417 --> 00:32:55,417
them thousands of the same
cylinder. Stock locks.
Whatever's cheeper. You also

301
00:32:55,417 --> 00:33:01,417
have industries where they try
to start enable shit online. So
MCE, it's like, oh, our, we have

302
00:33:06,208 --> 00:33:10,417
this box that you're going to
see later. Yeah, it's hooked up
and you put it on your net, WO,

303
00:33:10,417 --> 00:33:14,208
make sure you can fix it. Add an
"for MCE support. And make the
user's account  ‑ ‑ go ahead  ‑

304
00:33:14,208 --> 00:33:20,208
‑ just make it all for the same
password everywhere. Because we
need to get in. This is the MCE

305
00:33:26,792 --> 00:33:31,458
system that they need to get
into remotely. This is supposed
to be forward facing from your

306
00:33:31,458 --> 00:33:37,250
net work. This is up here  ‑ ‑  
‑ ‑ attached to the controller
so you can do all kinds of

307
00:33:37,250 --> 00:33:43,250
remote management. Is this the
kind of thing you think is smart
to be publicly facing with a

308
00:33:45,875 --> 00:33:51,375
user and password on the router
of your building called MCE
support where you can access

309
00:33:51,375 --> 00:33:55,917
these features remote TLI? Raise
your hand if that's a good idea.
>>	In this room a lot of hands

310
00:33:55,917 --> 00:34:02,000
are going up because we want
that to be a good idea. >>	But
it's cool, they paid for

311
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:09,250
extended support for X[P].
(Laughing) . >>	There's also
things like Otis elite service.

312
00:34:09,250 --> 00:34:15,833
>>	As your building requirements
change, you can customize your
elevator's operation, with a

313
00:34:15,833 --> 00:34:21,833
simple telephone call to our
elite engineers. >>	It won't be
a problem. I'm going to take

314
00:34:24,125 --> 00:34:29,292
elevator number two from the
bank. >>	JOU don't have the
independent key switch, just

315
00:34:29,292 --> 00:34:36,125
call the company up. I'm totally
bob Jones. This is my building.
On star for elevators. Bluff

316
00:34:36,125 --> 00:34:43,875
your way, and I'm sure you get
the elevator to do things. It's
all remote management. You have

317
00:34:43,875 --> 00:34:49,000
like this in the industry. This
fire keys we showed you. They
tried to push for a uniform fire

318
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:55,000
key. >>	Does anybody know what
[F]DOK is in. [F]DOK one was the
key that was adopteded in the

319
00:35:15,833 --> 00:35:21,083
2007 edition  ‑ ‑   ‑ ‑ they
wanted to eliminate firefighters
having to fire around keys that

320
00:35:21,083 --> 00:35:25,750
were over priced and weighed
pounds, they said let's just
make one standard key. Only you

321
00:35:25,750 --> 00:35:30,708
can have it. >>	Yup, only
elevator and emergency personnel
can use this. >>	So let's just

322
00:35:30,708 --> 00:35:34,583
publish the bidding. Thises the
kind of thing you see in the
industry. It's a industry that

323
00:35:34,583 --> 00:35:40,583
hasn't had any security
background pushing on any of
these topics. >>	This entire

324
00:35:57,792 --> 00:36:03,792
swing panel opens up. It's
insane. It's not secure at all.
>>	This is not secured either.

325
00:36:07,292 --> 00:36:13,583
What's happening? I'm not a
(indiscernible) speaker. This is
his first time on a stage at DEF

326
00:36:13,583 --> 00:36:19,583
CON. >>	It's very, very quiet,
they're hunting NUBs. How many
glasses are you (inaudible) oh

327
00:36:22,958 --> 00:36:29,625
why thank you. >>	Who was here
at the handcuff talk where goons
raided the stage with ninja

328
00:36:29,625 --> 00:36:36,708
sword and (indiscernible). And
gray had to get them out. Ray
had to get them out of the

329
00:36:36,708 --> 00:36:38,750
cuffs. This is why  ‑ ‑ people
have to bitch that DEF CON's
changing. It's black cats now.

330
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:40,750
And that's R[S]A. This doesn't
happen at black cats. >>	To our
new speakers. >>	Thank you

331
00:36:40,750 --> 00:36:42,750
fellas. >>	This is the final the
editions of (indiscernible)s for
this year. So I'd like to thank

332
00:36:42,750 --> 00:36:44,750
my shot new colleagues. You guys
like this? Should we do it again
next year? (Applause.) >>	Right

333
00:36:44,750 --> 00:36:46,750
on. >>	(Inaudible) your timing.
>>	There's no talk after us.
We'll just keep talking and

334
00:36:46,750 --> 00:36:48,750
answering questions all night if
we want. If you want to see fun
crazy, award ceremonies are

335
00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:50,750
happening right now where other
people are speaking for us. So
yeah, we'll hang out until hotel

336
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:52,750
throws us out of here if you
have crazy elevator questions.
Badge systems AUSHLGS kind of

337
00:36:52,750 --> 00:36:54,750
the key cards right. People use
those in a lot of buildings.
There's a lot of attacks about

338
00:36:54,750 --> 00:36:56,750
key cards. That could be its own
entire talk. Cloning
credentials, fortunately it's

339
00:36:56,750 --> 00:36:58,750
already been another talk. Mad
STREK research and years ago  ‑
‑   ‑ ‑ and educational where

340
00:36:58,750 --> 00:37:00,750
that look at mad STREK madness.
Look at a lot of his approximate
card stuff. If you want to be

341
00:37:00,750 --> 00:37:02,750
part of that cloning. Or be like
us, turn off the card reader and
use independent mode. In

342
00:37:02,750 --> 00:37:04,750
general, that's what pin testers
do. If you're going to break
into a building and leverage the

343
00:37:04,750 --> 00:37:06,750
elevators what are you doing?
We're optimizing his giant key
ring and just using it for pen

344
00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:08,750
testing. His key ring's cool,
but I sat around with Howard and
I actually just took all of his

345
00:37:08,750 --> 00:37:10,750
key  ‑ ‑ here's your giant
database and and here's your
list. I was like okay, screw

346
00:37:10,750 --> 00:37:12,750
lightses and fans. I'm not going
to turn off the lights or make
out with someone. But I'm like,

347
00:37:12,750 --> 00:37:14,750
okay, gif give me independent
service and floor cut outs and
then we spread all these keys

348
00:37:14,750 --> 00:37:16,750
out. Group these into how common
they are. So we have collections
of keys that are like this is

349
00:37:16,750 --> 00:37:18,750
70  percent of America. This is
the other like 20  percent. This
you'll basically never see.

350
00:37:18,750 --> 00:37:20,750
This, I wouldn't even buy. But
I'm crazy so I did. So yeah, we
grouped these up and if you are

351
00:37:20,750 --> 00:37:22,750
in the industry, maybe you speak
to us later if you want some
independent service keys and

352
00:37:22,750 --> 00:37:24,750
shit like that. Maybe you want
some fire keys. You can fuck
right off. Legal told us we

353
00:37:24,750 --> 00:37:26,750
could not give you those unless
we have J a special training
which maybe we'll write some

354
00:37:26,750 --> 00:37:28,750
day. I promise we're going to do
that at some point. But here,
you want an example, we have to

355
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:30,750
show  ‑ ‑ this is my favorite
client story ever
(indiscernible) switches. There

356
00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:32,750
AFS building, and this building
everyone went in through the
front and at the front there was

357
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:37,417
a guard (inaudible) credentials
and had the jam and with blah
blah blah blah blah. There was

358
00:37:37,417 --> 00:37:43,333
an elevator system and it
serviced the back entrance. They
said okay, this door, you'd need

359
00:37:43,333 --> 00:37:51,042
a badge or something to get in.
But no one really  ‑ ‑ everyone
just used it to park their car

360
00:37:51,042 --> 00:37:56,917
out back. And this elevator,
FEVEN you were in that lobby
that, rear lobby, the elevator

361
00:37:56,917 --> 00:38:03,250
wouldn't go anywhere because you
kneed a badge. If you didn't
have a badge, they said there's

362
00:38:03,250 --> 00:38:09,250
no reason to have a guard back
here. No one could take this
elevator where else. If you  ‑ ‑

363
00:38:42,375 --> 00:38:48,375
  ‑ ‑ the culture of this office
environment such no one
questioned us once we were in.

364
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:16,250
And when when he showed what
you're about to see to the
building own, you'll love their

365
00:39:16,250 --> 00:39:23,792
reaction. It blew their mind. So
here we are in the parking deck
he's carrying a camera and

366
00:39:23,792 --> 00:39:29,792
gotten security footage. The
door's locked. Not very well.
But now this elevator, we could

367
00:39:44,833 --> 00:39:51,250
call it, but we couldn't do
anything with it unless we had
our keys. >>	On on. >>	Phase

368
00:39:51,250 --> 00:39:57,250
one, phase two. >>	Yeah, now, we
did that a little fast. The
elevator controller got a little

369
00:39:59,833 --> 00:40:05,833
mad at the order in which we did
that. >>	Got very mad. We broke
the elevator. >>	Yeah, we had to

370
00:40:10,375 --> 00:40:17,792
fuss with it for a while before
we got it working again. But you
know, we got upstairs, so

371
00:40:17,792 --> 00:40:23,792
there's that. And then there you
are. You're upstairs you're
outside. And we showed this

372
00:40:48,708 --> 00:40:54,708
footage. The client was like
holy crap, how'd you get in we
trained in engineering. And we

373
00:41:34,542 --> 00:41:40,542
were like I socialed your
elevator bro. And the response
literally, that can't happen. We

374
00:42:00,250 --> 00:42:06,250
were told that elevator can't go
up. (Laughing) we're like what'd
you just say? It's an elevator.

375
00:42:09,625 --> 00:42:15,625
It has one job. Elevators go up.
(Laughing). But yeah yeah, you
have keys, if you can take over

376
00:42:19,292 --> 00:42:24,708
the ski switches, this is why it
was such a big to do in New York
when this gentleman on Ebay  ‑ ‑

377
00:42:24,708 --> 00:42:30,417
most of these keys are old and
dusted any way, but this guy was
selling keys and the New York

378
00:42:30,417 --> 00:42:34,833
post wanted to make a sky is
falling out of it. And a geting
a camera shoved in his face.

379
00:42:34,833 --> 00:42:42,583
Like oh my God you're selling
keys to the terrorists and then
they print a you a fucking

380
00:42:42,583 --> 00:42:46,792
article selling the keys. And we
were like no we were told you
can't copy those keys.

381
00:42:46,792 --> 00:42:52,792
>>	(Inaudible) all of those.
Exactly. So but the, in general,
yeah, these are like shitty

382
00:42:56,708 --> 00:43:02,583
bullshit bad versions of the
photos. Here's a nice photo of
that key. And you'll learn why

383
00:43:02,583 --> 00:43:07,042
it was not a security breech
that this is the New York City
key. This is like thee can that

384
00:43:07,042 --> 00:43:10,667
got all the cur  ‑ ‑ the bidding
code is [if you can|fuck]ing
2642. And it's not really,

385
00:43:10,667 --> 00:43:13,083
because the first position isn't
used. So yeah, like you saw this
and filed it in an office blank

386
00:43:13,083 --> 00:43:15,750
and we were able to do that in
New York and things. Now that's
just one siting. It's not like

387
00:43:15,750 --> 00:43:21,750
an entire three state region
would use another key. That's
also an unrestricted blank. And

388
00:43:38,792 --> 00:43:45,667
that also has a really easy code
to decode. We're just going to
drop a lot of FRIKing keys on

389
00:43:45,667 --> 00:43:50,000
you right now. We're going to
get through these slides fast.
>>	I'm going to take this slide

390
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:56,375
because there's an amazing story
behind this. I was buying keys
to make my key ring as complete

391
00:43:56,375 --> 00:44:02,125
as possible. And I came across
something very unusual. I was
purchasing some time for locks

392
00:44:02,125 --> 00:44:08,625
with a key. I found that was
easier to do. Sometimes people
would ask questions a little bit

393
00:44:08,625 --> 00:44:15,083
less. Ordering one key in
general  ‑ ‑ so I was sometimes
just buying the lock with the

394
00:44:15,083 --> 00:44:22,292
key. So in one case, I bought a
lock box. Like WEER seeing right
here. One of these little red

395
00:44:22,292 --> 00:44:29,125
lock boxes. And the key  ‑ ‑ the
cylinder on the front is
operated by this exact key that

396
00:44:29,125 --> 00:44:35,167
you're seeing here. And I
ordered another one, it was
state of Tennessee key. It was

397
00:44:35,167 --> 00:44:39,458
keyed to the state of Tennessee.
(Indiscernible) didn't come with
the key. I looked at ate and

398
00:44:39,458 --> 00:44:45,875
said it's just a flat key. And
it's open. Right? So how old is
this key? >>	Probably like a

399
00:44:45,875 --> 00:44:51,625
hundred‑ year‑ old. >>	This is
made by a company called game
(inaudible) made those fire

400
00:44:51,625 --> 00:44:56,458
boxes that you pull on the
street before everybody had
telephones and the firefighters

401
00:44:56,458 --> 00:45:00,125
would come and reset the boxes.
Somebody somewhere said let's
reuse the key. Here's the story.

402
00:45:00,125 --> 00:45:08,042
I called up the company and who
sold me the key box. I said wait
a minute you sold my one with T

403
00:45:08,042 --> 00:45:15,708
the key and  ‑ ‑ that's because
you asked for the Tennessee box.
They couldn't sell him  ‑ ‑ if

404
00:45:15,708 --> 00:45:20,583
you called and said I need the
Tennessee key, sorry you're not
authorized. I'm sorry, I had

405
00:45:20,583 --> 00:45:26,250
something crazy in my ear, I
need the game well Christmas
tree key. No problem. How about

406
00:45:26,250 --> 00:45:32,250
if you live in Indiana show of
hands. Anybody? You have good
gun] laws. You don't have good

407
00:45:35,250 --> 00:45:41,167
fire service keys though  ‑ ‑
tubular keys. We couldn't buy
the key, we could pick the lock

408
00:45:41,167 --> 00:45:45,542
box that's siting up here after
we picked it. We measured the
bidding. Used a little HURDdy

409
00:45:45,542 --> 00:45:53,250
GURdy chop chop. We made a key.
It's open. There's your frickin'
Indiana key. Some states aren't

410
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:59,250
using systems that are quite so
unrestricted. Kentucky. How many
people go to DUR by con. They

411
00:46:04,125 --> 00:46:10,125
use a MEDCO key. It's a classic,
but it's a MEDCO cam lock. You
can buy that you can't buy the

412
00:46:14,125 --> 00:46:20,042
key, just the cam lock. What can
you do to buy the box because it
ships open. If you take the tail

413
00:46:20,042 --> 00:46:26,042
piece off oh a MEDCO cam lock.
The front slides out. What
happens then? You peel off the

414
00:46:29,375 --> 00:46:34,542
top plait and have an [extra one
with you if you're doing it
nefariously. There's bob here

415
00:46:34,542 --> 00:46:38,625
he's helping to get this thing
apart. Holy crap. It's that
easy. There's the pins, there's

416
00:46:38,625 --> 00:46:43,833
the springs, let's put them on a
MEDCO tray. Let's do some
measurements. Let's compare that

417
00:46:43,833 --> 00:46:49,833
from what we know from our code
books. Let's put it back
together under five minutes you

418
00:46:52,250 --> 00:46:57,542
put a new brass plait on the
top. You're supposed to stamp
that down with a stamp tool. The

419
00:46:57,542 --> 00:47:03,250
lock Smith we got that from  ‑ ‑
  ‑ ‑ we had to stamp it down
with this. We just pounded on it

420
00:47:03,250 --> 00:47:09,250
with a (indiscernible) for a
while. But it's fine. And in the
end, there's your Cricken

421
00:47:14,250 --> 00:47:20,250
Kentucky key. >>	But wait
there's more. Florida divides
their states into zones. You

422
00:47:23,375 --> 00:47:29,917
can't buy the key, but you can
buy the lock. Little bit more
interesting, little bit harder

423
00:47:29,917 --> 00:47:35,917
to take apart. Not that hard. If
you have a pinning tray, it's
not a cam lock tray  ‑ ‑   ‑ ‑

424
00:47:38,250 --> 00:47:44,625
left right center. You can
completely check your code
books. Oh what's this? The zone

425
00:47:44,625 --> 00:47:50,875
four key. What's this? It's the
zone kick six key. So zone
seven. You want all of Florida

426
00:47:50,875 --> 00:47:56,750
K, seven keys instead of one.
And also we boughting the key
from Louisiana and decoded it.

427
00:47:56,750 --> 00:48:02,750
And we  ‑ ‑ ... and you can also
by  ‑ ‑ we could do this all
fucking day and we have all the

428
00:48:05,875 --> 00:48:11,875
god dam state keys in all the
states right now. (Applause.) So
we're not saying these are bad

429
00:48:18,667 --> 00:48:24,250
locks right? We're not
(indiscernible) up here. We're
not saying MEDCO is the worst

430
00:48:24,250 --> 00:48:29,167
cylinder ever and you should use
like get a (indiscernible) [F]
3D because you could try to take

431
00:48:29,167 --> 00:48:34,083
it apart it'll explode in your
face and you could never put it
together again. No we're saying

432
00:48:34,083 --> 00:48:38,792
you shouldn't think of your
mechanical key systems as a I
think sickle point of

433
00:48:38,792 --> 00:48:44,833
resistance. They're not going to
provide you ironclad security.
They can take it apart and

434
00:48:44,833 --> 00:48:52,333
measure the pins. Sure they
|fucking can. >>	Also there's
implementation. If you're floor

435
00:48:52,333 --> 00:48:57,125
with the Knox box type of system
it's IFRMmented a little bit
better.   ‑ ‑   ‑ ‑ lock and

436
00:48:57,125 --> 00:49:01,833
take it apart. The fire
department is authorizing to
purchase and possess a cylinder

437
00:49:01,833 --> 00:49:09,583
itself. But that doesn't mean
the fire righters don't just
lose these things in the

438
00:49:09,583 --> 00:49:16,458
hundred  ‑ ‑ like really? Come
on. That was over like two or
three years too. >>	And I'm

439
00:49:16,458 --> 00:49:21,792
talking like one a day. >>	Now
this is all, again, this is fire
service operation. This is one

440
00:49:21,792 --> 00:49:26,917
of the most powerful modes. It's
actually not as hard as you
think to get the keys. No we

441
00:49:26,917 --> 00:49:31,583
won't just give them to you.
Maybe you'll like hack through
my laptop and get the biddings I

442
00:49:31,583 --> 00:49:36,333
redacted on the slides. But  ‑ ‑
  ‑ ‑ there's what can you do in
the hoist way, the answer is

443
00:49:36,333 --> 00:49:42,333
everything. What if you have a
building that you  ‑ ‑ you know
the fire key in the lobby that

444
00:49:46,042 --> 00:49:49,792
we used  ‑ ‑ if you're not in
the lobby, what if you want to
move around the building. Well

445
00:49:49,792 --> 00:49:56,167
if you seized control of the
elevator and you get on the car
top, and I don't mean you

446
00:49:56,167 --> 00:50:03,542
because you shouldn't. You could
do this. On the lower right you
see where we are. The upper

447
00:50:03,542 --> 00:50:08,833
right is where we want to be.
This is an elevator that is
driving itself down the hoist

448
00:50:08,833 --> 00:50:15,500
way because we sent some calls
down that way. If [we want to,
we can seize the car in a way

449
00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:19,083
that's completely out of
standard. You're not supposed to
do it. I've her Honored from

450
00:50:19,083 --> 00:50:24,500
Howard, there's three ways to do
things. There's the right way,
the wrong way and the elevator

451
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:30,833
person way. >>	Which is like the
wrong way faster basically.
>>	So here we are  ‑ ‑ there's

452
00:50:30,833 --> 00:50:36,167
the car top, all right, we're on
a mode  ‑ ‑ we're not RAL going
to talk about (indiscernible)

453
00:50:36,167 --> 00:50:42,667
right now. But if we take
control of this elevator and we
get on to the car top, my mom

454
00:50:42,667 --> 00:50:48,417
hated this video. She almost
smacked me when she saw it. What
are you doing. You shouldn't be

455
00:50:48,417 --> 00:50:54,417
there. You're an idiot. So once
you're in the hoist way, you can
drive this car anywhere. It

456
00:50:58,208 --> 00:51:04,917
literally doesn't matter
(inaudible) this one wasn't, but
in the hoist way, your risk of

457
00:51:04,917 --> 00:51:10,667
life is so great that you have
utter absolute control. You can
drive any direction. You can go

458
00:51:10,667 --> 00:51:16,500
to any other floor. What kind of
security do you think the hoist
(indiscernible) doors have on

459
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:22,500
the other side? (Inaudible) 0.
There we are, thank you good
night. You can just send it

460
00:51:25,667 --> 00:51:31,667
down. So how do we do that?
>>	You've seen that little hole
right SNG. >>	Real quick

461
00:51:35,667 --> 00:51:40,833
disclaimer, there's another
video, where we are completely
out of control and almost

462
00:51:40,833 --> 00:51:46,042
crashed in the over head. Down
down down in the black and
jumping down in the grease in

463
00:51:46,042 --> 00:51:51,750
the elevator car top. Sometimes
thing can be unpredictable.
Sometimes out of your control.

464
00:51:51,750 --> 00:51:56,042
So if you see that hole in the
door, that's call add
(indiscernible) hole. That is

465
00:51:56,042 --> 00:52:00,917
the hole through which elevator
personnel that will  ‑ ‑ that
will usually flip a flag that

466
00:52:00,917 --> 00:52:08,667
release it is door interlock. It
does two things. It keeps the
doors mechanically closed and it

467
00:52:08,667 --> 00:52:13,167
also electrically signals to the
controller that the DOOSHs are
closed. So BHEN an elevator

468
00:52:13,167 --> 00:52:19,125
mechanic sticks it key in and
turn it. It unlock it is door
and sends a signal to the

469
00:52:19,125 --> 00:52:23,583
controller that the door is
open, stop the cab. With that
being said, there's a million

470
00:52:23,583 --> 00:52:29,458
different kinds of key, but
there's a key for every door at
the end of the the day  ‑ ‑   ‑

471
00:52:29,458 --> 00:52:33,333
‑ sometimes it doesn't have a
hole, there are often ways of
interacting with the interlock

472
00:52:33,333 --> 00:52:39,333
that you [might not expect. >>	I
know how Hoover this talk is, I
really do. Unfortunately, you're

473
00:52:41,833 --> 00:52:49,667
trying to set up for final
ceremonies, and this track has
to end. Now I have a problem

474
00:52:49,667 --> 00:52:54,292
with usually we shot this
SPAEKers, that's nice for them.
But we have little tricks up our

475
00:52:54,292 --> 00:53:00,292
sleeves to lure the speakers off
stage. So I brought with me some
bait. Come on, come on speakers.

476
00:53:02,583 --> 00:53:08,875
>>	I'm literally not going.
Because it is not (inaudible).
We have seven minutes and we're

477
00:53:08,875 --> 00:53:16,042
going to use all seven minutes.
(Applause.) (Indiscernible)
really fast. You know people

478
00:53:16,042 --> 00:53:23,208
used to stash drugs in hoist way
Z because they could pop that
hole. They made a lock for it.

479
00:53:23,208 --> 00:53:27,958
The lock was interesting, it
would plug up the hole. The lock
had a problem in the way it was

480
00:53:27,958 --> 00:53:34,250
assembled. The lock screwed
together. So if the lock screws
together and you can just

481
00:53:34,250 --> 00:53:41,625
unscrew the collar, you don't
need the real key, what you can
do is say that's the speedy key.

482
00:53:41,625 --> 00:53:47,625
That it's fast key. If you don't
have that key, well what if you
had any other possible key ever?

483
00:53:55,625 --> 00:54:01,625
Yeah. Put a little torque on
that. Push a little harder. Oh
my, what happened there? Yeah

484
00:54:04,250 --> 00:54:11,167
just unscrew the (indiscernible)
lock. Pull it apart, whatever.
Fine. Come talk to us  ‑ ‑

485
00:54:11,167 --> 00:54:15,042
there's so  ‑ ‑ we're going to
skip a few slides. We're going
to show you some others. In the

486
00:54:15,042 --> 00:54:20,167
end, there are some really
common guidelines we can give
you right? >>	 >>	First thing if

487
00:54:20,167 --> 00:54:25,125
you have an emergency phone in
the elevator that's answered by
your your security desk. This is

488
00:54:25,125 --> 00:54:31,125
a case where a guy got stuck in
an elevator for over 48  hours
because the phone didn't work.

489
00:54:33,792 --> 00:54:41,542
There ended up being a lawsuit.
Test your alarm bell. Make sure
it works too. >>	(Speaking

490
00:54:41,542 --> 00:54:45,917
simultaneously) the hoist way
should never be accessful. No
one should be in there and ride

491
00:54:45,917 --> 00:54:52,625
the fucking counterweight. >>	If
anybody recognizes this photo,
I'll buy you a drink at the bar.

492
00:54:52,625 --> 00:55:00,417
Your motor room, should be self‑
closing self‑ locking. This is
not self‑ closing or self‑

493
00:55:00,417 --> 00:55:05,167
locking and B is being operated
by a frickin' mall security
guard who shouldn't be in there

494
00:55:05,167 --> 00:55:09,667
because it's dangerous. Only
elevator people should be in
there. Because you know these

495
00:55:09,667 --> 00:55:15,667
guys are elevator guys. Yeah.
Know who your elevator staff is.
They are not your maintenance

496
00:55:22,292 --> 00:55:27,000
crew. They are very nice sir.
Know who your people are that
provide your maintenance vs.

497
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:33,125
consulting. Know who your people
are and what they're doing. If
you have bullshit jobs and

498
00:55:33,125 --> 00:55:37,167
paperwork that's not being
pulled out if you have
(indiscernible) or inspection

499
00:55:37,167 --> 00:55:42,292
that is don't make any sense,
what is this? There are test
tabs. It's a permanently affixed

500
00:55:42,292 --> 00:55:47,750
tab that after, every year,
every five years there is
performed they fill it out

501
00:55:47,750 --> 00:55:54,000
indicating the elevator passed
hopefully and it's left there so
if somebody ever has to come in

502
00:55:54,000 --> 00:56:01,667
and take a look and say when the
test was done and  ‑ ‑ let us
know that OETS performed the

503
00:56:01,667 --> 00:56:08,083
test, because that makes sense.
Unless the guy's name was Otis.
Elevator tests are important.

504
00:56:08,083 --> 00:56:14,083
Here's a final (indiscernible)
in this test. (Applause.) Yeah
and the client didn't, no it's

505
00:56:17,042 --> 00:56:22,083
fine right? To be fair, the
elevator mechanic said there's
no way this is going to work.

506
00:56:22,083 --> 00:56:27,625
And he made his supervisor come
down he was the one recording
it. You want to RAUN the test,

507
00:56:27,625 --> 00:56:35,250
you run the test, I'll record
it. So yeah, follow all of your
building procedures. How many

508
00:56:35,250 --> 00:56:41,500
times we've coasted in on oh I'm
the elevator guy I BLONG here. I
have a shirt I bought which you

509
00:56:41,500 --> 00:56:46,625
can't anymore. You can no longer
buy the YUVEN forms we're
wearing right now. Pretty much

510
00:56:46,625 --> 00:56:53,625
thanks (inaudible). >>	I believe
they did. >>	So what do you do
now? If your elevators are maybe

511
00:56:53,625 --> 00:56:57,917
part of your security models and
you're like oh my God, what if
people are going to attack the

512
00:56:57,917 --> 00:57:04,083
elevators because they're not
actually doing what they think,
there is a difference between

513
00:57:04,083 --> 00:57:10,625
your parts oil and grease tech
at a security consultant. There
are people that do this. Not

514
00:57:10,625 --> 00:57:16,208
like a lot of them. He's kind of
the only ones we've ever Maine
but your elevator controller can

515
00:57:16,208 --> 00:57:22,083
actually do monitoring without
installing a fucking windows box
in the motor room. Your elevator

516
00:57:22,083 --> 00:57:27,458
controller can open or close
contacts if it gets flipped on
independent mode or inspection

517
00:57:27,458 --> 00:57:34,667
mode or fire mode. You could be
logging this with your access
control system or alarm system.

518
00:57:34,667 --> 00:57:40,208
There are add on boards, extra
modules that you can use to make
your system better. We're going

519
00:57:40,208 --> 00:57:44,167
to wrap it up in one minute with
some final tips they're useful
if you're a jackass and get

520
00:57:44,167 --> 00:57:50,042
stuck. First tip, don't panic.
You're not going to run out of
air. There's a fan. And just in

521
00:57:50,042 --> 00:57:57,833
general, there's oxygen. So just
relax. The second thing is, if
you're on a red team, you don't

522
00:57:57,833 --> 00:58:03,833
want to use the emergency phone.
But if the main light in the cab
are off, the power's out.

523
00:58:05,917 --> 00:58:10,833
There's nothing you can do. If
the cab lights are still on, you
might have a few options. .

524
00:58:10,833 --> 00:58:17,542
Let's just run through a few
scripts. They're going to tell
you to hit door open. Would you

525
00:58:17,542 --> 00:58:21,208
believe that happens all the
time. Someone's just siting
there. The cab is parked and

526
00:58:21,208 --> 00:58:24,667
they just don't think to hit
door open. They might tell you
to hit door close and then hit

527
00:58:24,667 --> 00:58:30,667
door open. This sometimes when
the door operator hadn't fully
closed the doors allows it to

528
00:58:32,750 --> 00:58:37,500
fully close and signalling to
the elevator (indiscernible)
run. Another option would be

529
00:58:37,500 --> 00:58:42,333
make sure you can register a
call to another floor. If you're
sitting there and staring at it

530
00:58:42,333 --> 00:58:48,000
and it's stuck, you're stuck.
But maybe you're stuck at a
floor you don't have access to.

531
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:55,250
Package in ETS. >>	If you have a
badge, make sure it's in before
you're placing the callsment Ma.

532
00:58:55,250 --> 00:59:03,083
Maybe your a authorized user and
your key switches. >>	Or e‑
mailed me and bought some keys.

533
00:59:03,083 --> 00:59:07,167
>>	You could try the key
switches I've been stuck in
elevators (inaudible). And of

534
00:59:07,167 --> 00:59:11,875
course, the last thing is, keep
in mind the number one cause of
encrapments is that the doors

535
00:59:11,875 --> 00:59:17,542
have opened somewhere. It might
not be where you are, but it
might be. So I very hesitantly

536
00:59:17,542 --> 00:59:23,625
say this you can kind of
troubleshoot the doors in a safe
way. Don't stick your hand in

537
00:59:23,625 --> 00:59:30,375
the gap between the doors. Just
very gently put your palm on the
door, see if it's jiggling and

538
00:59:30,375 --> 00:59:36,375
try to close them with the flat
part of your hand somewhere
square on the door. And if all

539
00:59:39,458 --> 00:59:44,458
else fails, call for help.
>>	I'll help you. >>	Never ever
ever try to leave through the

540
00:59:44,458 --> 00:59:48,833
top hatch. It doesn't lead you
anywhere and it'll fuck other
shit up. Never ever exit a

541
00:59:48,833 --> 00:59:54,833
missed level car. If
you have to jump it's too far,
stay in the elevator. It's the

542
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:05,000
safest place to be, the elevator
wants to keep you alive. We
wanted to keep you alive. We

543
01:00:05,000 --> 00:00:00,000
hope you learned something
today. Thank you for letting us
talk at DEF CON. (Applause.)
