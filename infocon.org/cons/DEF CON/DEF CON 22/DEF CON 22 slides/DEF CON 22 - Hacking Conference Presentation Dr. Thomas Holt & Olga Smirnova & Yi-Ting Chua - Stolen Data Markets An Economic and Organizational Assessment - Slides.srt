Introducing Thomas Holt
Associate Professor at Michigan
State University. [Applause] >>

2
00:00:09,125 --> 00:00:16,250
Thank you. Thanks, everybody. I
appreciate it. Thanks for coming
during lunch. I know this is

3
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:21,000
always a hard thing to do.
Hopefully you have a beer and
some liquid food to enjoy. Today

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,875
what we're going to talk about
are Stolen Data Markets. This is
something you probably have

5
00:00:26,875 --> 00:00:32,292
familiarity with already. Raise
your hand if you have heard
about mass data bridges. I would

6
00:00:32,292 --> 00:00:38,292
think everybody, good. Anybody
had their card reissued this
year? I'm working on my fourth

7
00:00:40,417 --> 00:00:45,917
card this year thanks in part to
the fact that I have a nine
month old who requires all kinds

8
00:00:45,917 --> 00:00:51,333
of stuff so between going to
Target and going out to eat
we've lost many a card this year

9
00:00:51,333 --> 00:00:56,000
so mass data breaches have
become a big problem in part of
my personal and professional

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,417
life. Today we're going to talk
about research funded through
the National Institute of

11
00:01:02,417 --> 00:01:06,042
Justice. This thing at the
bottom is a direct result of our
funding agency. So as a point of

12
00:01:06,042 --> 00:01:08,042
clarification this research was
funded by the U.S. Department of
Justice and everything I'm going

13
00:01:08,042 --> 00:01:10,042
to talk about today is in no way
a reflection of the attitudes,
opinions or what have you of the

14
00:01:10,042 --> 00:01:12,042
Department of Justice itself.
With that out of the way we'll
jump into the fun stuff. In

15
00:01:12,042 --> 00:01:17,167
thinking about Data Breaches in
an academic point of view,
there's been a good deal of

16
00:01:17,167 --> 00:01:23,167
research that's started to come
out. Most looked at two angles
either the IRC communications

17
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:32,750
that go on or through forum data
sets. Thinking about the IRC
data this is good but there are

18
00:01:35,708 --> 00:01:41,708
substantial limits. The same is
true as far as what it seems as
though forums are becoming a

19
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:59,542
little bit more of a popular
medium for individuals to sell
data through mass breaches but

20
00:01:59,542 --> 00:02:05,417
the limitations through all of
these data sets are substantial
and we have to give some

21
00:02:05,417 --> 00:02:11,333
consideration to that. When we
think about who is selling data,
one of the biggest dilemmas that

22
00:02:11,333 --> 00:02:16,042
emerges is the fact that
communications typically take
place in cyrillic or to a

23
00:02:16,042 --> 00:02:23,458
certain extent English languages
communications. Cyrillic based
languages, are they Russian or

24
00:02:23,458 --> 00:02:29,625
are they using machine
translation. If you have ever
used Google translate you know

25
00:02:29,625 --> 00:02:35,917
the translations are adequate,
sometimes very poor so that's
going to have a direct impact on

26
00:02:35,917 --> 00:02:41,625
what it is we're studying. Most
of them are based off of a small
sample. It could be maybe two to

27
00:02:41,625 --> 00:02:47,333
four forums. Some people have
started to use single IRC sets
and a small number of

28
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:52,167
researchers have begun to use
dead forums. So groups like the
shadow crew, the grifters, the

29
00:02:52,167 --> 00:02:56,917
dark market data set and
analyzing those. It's very
helpful but if we're talking

30
00:02:56,917 --> 00:03:01,292
about a group was that active
five to 10 years ago what is
that going to tell us about the

31
00:03:01,292 --> 00:03:07,583
processes of the market as it
exists now? So one of the
biggest issues that emerges

32
00:03:07,583 --> 00:03:13,125
within this whole round of
research is the fact that very
few people have tried to assess

33
00:03:13,125 --> 00:03:17,875
anything with regard to the
economics of the markets
themselves. Only two studies

34
00:03:17,875 --> 00:03:23,500
have even published information
about the basic pricing for
data. So if we're talking about

35
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:28,667
a credit or debit card number
how much is it going for? That
information is largely absent

36
00:03:28,667 --> 00:03:33,292
from the empirical research. The
same is true in regard to
organizational issues. Are we

37
00:03:33,292 --> 00:03:39,417
talking about a complex mafioso
organized crime network or
talking about something that's

38
00:03:39,417 --> 00:03:45,125
more distributed? More of a
network of colleagues rather
than something that's very, very

39
00:03:45,125 --> 00:03:51,000
sophisticated. And in thinking
about the data markets
themselves there's good, good

40
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:57,000
theoretical research that talks
about the idea of these markets
being lemon markets, basically

41
00:03:59,333 --> 00:04:05,667
prices vary and what you pay
directly impacts what you get.
Same with buying a bad car from

42
00:04:05,667 --> 00:04:10,292
a car lot. If you buy a car for
a thousand dollars and it breaks
down as soon as you leave the

43
00:04:10,292 --> 00:04:15,000
lot that's a direct expense you
incur. You might have gotten the
car cheaply, but it stopped

44
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,792
working on you almost
immediately. The same could be
true with data markets. If we're

45
00:04:19,792 --> 00:04:24,542
looking at information from
English language forums where
people are untrustworthy and

46
00:04:24,542 --> 00:04:28,875
there's lots of complaints the
fact that they're selling data
for five dollars a lot doesn't

47
00:04:28,875 --> 00:04:34,208
tell us much because that data
might be inactive or old or
invalid and it's not a true

48
00:04:34,208 --> 00:04:39,833
reflection of what we are
seeing. So there's an argument
that there are multiple markets

49
00:04:39,833 --> 00:04:44,625
operating. There's a lower
barrier to entry for English
language forums. If we were to

50
00:04:44,625 --> 00:04:50,625
Google stolen data markets we
would see no barrier to entry
and you probably can't trust

51
00:04:54,958 --> 00:05:00,625
what's being sold. There's a
deeper secondary market that
exists where we expect higher

52
00:05:00,625 --> 00:05:06,333
prices, greater trust, greater
insularity and as a result,
those may be a more accurate

53
00:05:06,333 --> 00:05:12,500
reflection of the market in and
of itself but few people have
tried to address these questions

54
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:19,000
empirically. Instead we end up
with the question what do the
markets look like? We'll talk

55
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:25,750
about what the conditions are
like within the market, what are
the costs for goods and

56
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:29,708
services, what's the
organization of the market and
then what are the structures

57
00:05:29,708 --> 00:05:35,292
like between participants, how
do they know and relate to one
another? And to do this we

58
00:05:35,292 --> 00:05:42,125
collected a set of posts and
threads from 13 active forums.
We oversampled on Russian

59
00:05:42,125 --> 00:05:48,625
language groups and tried to
capture a range of entities
operating world wide. We have a

60
00:05:48,625 --> 00:05:55,417
number operating out of Russia,
some in Germany, one in the UK,
Netherlands and a few in the

61
00:05:55,417 --> 00:06:01,417
U.S, one in the British Virgin
Islands, but communicated in
Russian. It gives us a sense of

62
00:06:07,125 --> 00:06:11,708
where the sites operate. The
language is more important. If
we're talking about a site in

63
00:06:11,708 --> 00:06:16,583
the British Virgin Islands where
everyone's communicating Russian
it's unlikely that it's the

64
00:06:16,583 --> 00:06:24,000
residents participating. We're
talking about Russians, eastern
Europeans or people using Google

65
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:31,417
translate to talk. And we
captured a number of threads
from each of the forums and

66
00:06:31,417 --> 00:06:38,292
tried to over sample on time
frame. We have data going back
to 2007 in four of our forums

67
00:06:38,292 --> 00:06:44,292
and some going back to 2008. Our
data collection stops at 2011 or
2012 depending as we had to

68
00:06:46,417 --> 00:06:51,333
collect all of it and had to
analyze it and translate it. We
worked with a certified Russian

69
00:06:51,333 --> 00:06:56,792
translator to get the
tranlasations as they appeared
in as close as we could in

70
00:06:56,792 --> 00:07:01,375
approximation to English as
possible because unfortunately I
don't speak Russian. My

71
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:05,708
colleague in the study is a
native Russian and her assistant
was great in getting the project

72
00:07:05,708 --> 00:07:11,708
off the ground. The reason that
we have both English and Russian
language groups in our sample is

73
00:07:15,875 --> 00:07:22,625
because we wanted to get at this
question the lemon market
argument. What does an English

74
00:07:22,625 --> 00:07:27,167
language market look like
relative to a Russian one and
can we find evidence of

75
00:07:27,167 --> 00:07:32,167
differences in terms of
products, resources or
organizational dynamics within

76
00:07:32,167 --> 00:07:37,875
the market based on language? So
that's the rationale for this
study. In thinking strategically

77
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:43,875
about what is sold we conducted
an economic analysis breaking
out products by specific

78
00:07:46,625 --> 00:07:52,625
purpose. Most of the data in our
set involved advertisements for
data sales. So we have a range

79
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:00,042
of things like dumps if you are
familiar with the term dump it
refers to a lot of personal

80
00:08:00,042 --> 00:08:06,083
information associated with a
credit or debit card. Some
individuals selling CVV's the

81
00:08:06,083 --> 00:08:12,083
security code on the back of the
card. A small proportion selling
Fulls and those are all of the

82
00:08:14,667 --> 00:08:19,333
information associated with an
account including Social
Security number, address and

83
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:24,875
pertinent information that would
allow an individual to take over
the account. Some people selling

84
00:08:24,875 --> 00:08:29,167
Ebay accounts, and other
personal accounts and personal
information whether it's E‑mail

85
00:08:29,167 --> 00:08:33,583
user names and passwords and
other financial products
generally. In case you are

86
00:08:33,583 --> 00:08:40,500
wondering no we did not see
medical data in here nor stocks
or other types of financial

87
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:46,208
products of that nature instead
it's mostly involving financial
institutions, banks and credit

88
00:08:46,208 --> 00:08:51,667
card agencies. But we had a
number of individuals selling
data manipulation tools. This

89
00:08:51,667 --> 00:08:56,583
might be cash out services,
people who can go withdraw cash
from legally acquired accounts,

90
00:08:56,583 --> 00:09:04,333
some people offer drops where
you buy goods online and have
them shipped to a specific

91
00:09:04,333 --> 00:09:10,333
location and left via UPS or
FedEx and those products are
pawned, fenced, or shipped on to

92
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:24,083
another person so an
intermediary for goods. And a
small number doing money

93
00:09:24,083 --> 00:09:28,208
transfers. And a small number
offering personal identity
documents so if you needed a

94
00:09:28,208 --> 00:09:32,833
credit report or credit history
or something else they would be
the individuals to go to. Also a

95
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:39,417
small amount of sellers we saw
offering associated services in
order to manipulate data on the

96
00:09:39,417 --> 00:09:46,875
back end or acquire it on the
front end. A small number of
people sell skimmers, that's a

97
00:09:46,875 --> 00:09:54,708
device that you clip on to an
ATM or gas station terminal
where you swipe the card and it

98
00:09:54,708 --> 00:10:01,375
captures the data on the back of
the magnetic strip. That's a
very small proportion. 84% of

99
00:10:01,375 --> 00:10:09,292
our ads involved data sales of
some type. Moving from the
economy we're going to look at

100
00:10:09,292 --> 00:10:14,625
this from a organizational
perspective. We use a
sociological framework which is

101
00:10:14,625 --> 00:10:18,208
admittediably a little bit
different than what you're used
to. >> In this case we tried to

102
00:10:18,208 --> 00:10:23,833
understand how people operate
based on how they work together,
how they communicate and how

103
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:31,792
long they exist. This gives us a
framework for analysis, are they
like a Acusa or Mafia or flat

104
00:10:31,792 --> 00:10:35,292
but tries to understand the
group based on different
divisions. How long they

105
00:10:35,292 --> 00:10:40,000
operate, what kind of division
of labor is present? Do you have
someone that is a distinct

106
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:45,000
coder? Another person receives
goods so is there any kind of
specialized labor force

107
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,792
operating? Do they offend
together? That's the issue of
mutual participation? And then

108
00:10:49,792 --> 00:10:53,875
there is the issue of mutual
association. How do they get
along? There are some types of

109
00:10:53,875 --> 00:11:00,625
crime where you don't have to
know the person. For example
prostitution. You don't have to

110
00:11:00,625 --> 00:11:06,625
know anybody, you go, solicit,
do your business, everybody
leaves. We want to know what

111
00:11:09,625 --> 00:11:14,500
types of relationships are we
seeing in these markets for
stolen data? And finally

112
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:18,250
depending on time, we also
conducted a network analysis. So
if you are familiar with network

113
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:24,792
analyses these are ways to
statistically connect
individuals within a market.

114
00:11:24,792 --> 00:11:28,500
This sociograph here represents
participants in one of our
boards. We have a small number

115
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:34,250
of individuals connected. Say
here we have one person who is a
seller with a number of people

116
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:40,250
and you can talking to that
seller and see what we can buy
and what we can get. Then we

117
00:11:42,375 --> 00:11:47,000
have a number of isolates at the
bottom. These are people who no
one talks to for one reason or

118
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,000
another. >> This is important if
we're thinking about targeting
groups. How do you disrupt the

119
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,917
network if they're loosely
connected? It's different than
how you might if there's a

120
00:11:54,917 --> 00:12:00,417
hierarchical structure in place.
This is an important way to
think about connectivity. How

121
00:12:00,417 --> 00:12:08,333
does the market operate? What
I'll talk about now relates to
both social organization and

122
00:12:08,333 --> 00:12:14,417
economics. If you are not
familiar with how these markets
operate it starts when someone

123
00:12:14,417 --> 00:12:21,250
posts an ad. This is an ad for
instance, for dumps. I realize
this is small but I'll hit the

124
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:25,750
high notes for you. This person
is selling Dumps: stolen credit
card numbers from around the

125
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:31,833
world. They're offering U.S.
data. A classic or standard card
is 20 bucks, Gold or a platinum

126
00:12:31,833 --> 00:12:37,958
card is 25 bucks, a business or
signature corporate card is 30
and American Express card is 20.

127
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:43,958
And then Canadian dumps.
Interestingly Canadian data is
more expensive. $50 for a

128
00:12:47,375 --> 00:12:53,833
classic or standard card, $70 to
$200 depending on what type of
advanced data you want. Then

129
00:12:53,833 --> 00:12:58,250
getting into European markets in
places where chip and pin
encryption is used, you can see

130
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:03,500
the prices are even higher. This
is important to note. Every ad
typically incorporates

131
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:09,000
information about pricing
structures and the quality or
quantity of data available. They

132
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:15,000
piece it out by product and
type. They also explain their
conditions for sales. Since

133
00:13:17,375 --> 00:13:23,500
vendors have the ability to
advertise and direct their
traffic they can explain in very

134
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:27,750
crystal clear terms how you and
the seller are going to
interact. In this case the

135
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:33,458
person explains how you do
business. You contact them, use
the one ICQ number that you want

136
00:13:33,458 --> 00:13:39,458
to use, calculate the price and
then submit your order. Send
money first and your e-mail.

137
00:13:42,208 --> 00:13:47,208
How's that for a bum deal. Send
money first and then we'll send
you product. This is different

138
00:13:47,208 --> 00:13:53,125
than a drug transaction or other
illicit markets in the real
world where product and payment

139
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:57,792
can be exchanged near
simultaneously or within
relative close proximity.

140
00:13:57,792 --> 00:14:04,167
Instead this seller says send me
money and within 24 hours we'll
complete your order. In this

141
00:14:04,167 --> 00:14:08,333
case Liberty Reserve payments
are what they prefer. Anybody
heard of Liberty Reserve

142
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:15,458
payments before? They were
recently taken out of a large
scale law enforcement use in the

143
00:14:15,458 --> 00:14:20,875
U.S. This payment venue no
longer exists but online
currency payment systems like

144
00:14:20,875 --> 00:14:25,958
Liberty Reserve are the
preference for individuals in
this marketplace. We didn't see

145
00:14:25,958 --> 00:14:31,250
anybody using Bitocin incase you
were curious, or any other types
of crypto currencies. These

146
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:36,625
individuals seem to be tailored
more towards immediate transfers
of payments. 	There's an

147
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:42,500
interesting point here. Point 5.
We replace only pick-up or hold
call dumps within a 24 hour

148
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:49,750
period. What that means if you
bought 100 cards from this
person and 90 worked and 10 came

149
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:56,917
back as either invalid, inactive
or held as inactive cards, you
can contact the seller and say I

150
00:14:56,917 --> 00:15:02,167
need these 10 cards replaced and
they'll do so. That's a degree
of customer support they're

151
00:15:02,167 --> 00:15:06,375
willing to offer. Just wait. It
will get weirder. Customer
service is an important venue

152
00:15:06,375 --> 00:15:12,375
within these market places to
generate people to your
business, you want people to

153
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:22,417
come back and buy from you on a
consistent basis. Offer them
something and give them a reason

154
00:15:22,417 --> 00:15:28,417
to come back to you. So this
individual for instance, offers
free replacements. There are

155
00:15:28,417 --> 00:15:34,125
other types of customer service
that are out there. This is a
good example. A person selling

156
00:15:34,125 --> 00:15:39,625
eBay and PayPal accounts from
the US and the UK. You can see
Tthe pricing structure is low.

157
00:15:39,625 --> 00:15:45,542
If you want an unverified
account with a credit card
number, it's 1WMZ or LR. That

158
00:15:45,542 --> 00:15:51,500
means web money US. Z is the
designated nation or $1 Liberty
Reserve. If you want an

159
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:56,250
unverified account attached to a
bank account that's a dollar. If
you want a verified Pay Pal

160
00:15:56,250 --> 00:16:03,458
account with a credit card
number, that's $3. Anybody have
a confirmed account? a couple of

161
00:16:03,458 --> 00:16:09,000
you? That's pretty cheap. We
have accounts with E‑mail, just
ask. The seller's not

162
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:15,208
responsible for security
measures. We check all accounts
manually prior to giving them to

163
00:16:15,208 --> 00:16:21,083
you and you will get a clean
socks5 proxy. the rationale
being if you are an individual

164
00:16:21,083 --> 00:16:26,958
living in Europe trying to use a
U.S. account it's clear that the
traffic is coming from Romania

165
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:31,125
you will not be able to use the
account. They will give you a
proxy for the associated

166
00:16:31,125 --> 00:16:36,792
country. If you burn the proxy
it's on you as they say here.
Seller is not responsible for

167
00:16:36,792 --> 00:16:43,750
the unsuccessful usage of the
account. If you burn the proxy
you have to get another one.

168
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:49,000
They're offering a modicum of
support but nothing too fancy.
This is the type of

169
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,500
communication that each
individual can specify. Vendors
can control the market based on

170
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:59,375
what they feel is relevant and a
final example an individual
offering money laundering

171
00:16:59,375 --> 00:17:05,458
service. They work specifically
with the Russian federation,
they will work with cash funds ,

172
00:17:05,458 --> 00:17:12,292
they will transmit electronic
funds, with dirty funds and the
advantage working with them, low

173
00:17:12,292 --> 00:17:16,708
commission. With regard to
customer service they're going
to take a portion of the amount

174
00:17:16,708 --> 00:17:21,292
of money. Say there's a thousand
dollars being laundered they'll
take between 10 and 20 percent

175
00:17:21,292 --> 00:17:26,667
as you dictate the terms and
work out the relationship. And
speed, as a rule funds are

176
00:17:26,667 --> 00:17:31,042
received on the day they're
credited to the company's
account. Next day or maximum of

177
00:17:31,042 --> 00:17:35,958
one day after they're credited.
So you want your money quickly
work with us. We turn things

178
00:17:35,958 --> 00:17:41,250
around fast. This idea of
customer service is very, very
interesting and very unique to

179
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:48,125
these markets. Just to give you
a quick sense of how products
are priced, this is a break out

180
00:17:48,125 --> 00:17:54,417
of our product pricing. Let's go
with dumps because that's a
common item sold. The lowest

181
00:17:54,417 --> 00:18:01,667
price we saw was 4 cents,
highest was $8,000. Gives us an
average of $102.60. We saw CVVs

182
00:18:01,667 --> 00:18:08,958
going for between 1 dollar 8,000
dollars, the average being
$26.We saw the majority of our

183
00:18:08,958 --> 00:18:15,042
pricing going towards our data
products. Data manipulation
services vary and largely it was

184
00:18:15,042 --> 00:18:20,208
because individuals would list
percentages rather than total
amounts. The reason being if you

185
00:18:20,208 --> 00:18:24,792
are laundering money on
someone's behalf or working as a
cash out team, it will be easier

186
00:18:24,792 --> 00:18:29,750
to take a proportion of those
funds than to have a set rate in
advance. It works out for

187
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:35,750
everyone to have a little bit of
difference in payment. What I
want to do is move on to a

188
00:18:38,875 --> 00:18:45,125
specific idea about quality and
quantity of services. These are
the products that are sold in

189
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:51,083
our markets based on the top 10.
If we include all forums in our
sample the majority of products

190
00:18:51,083 --> 00:18:58,042
sold are dumps and CVVs. But
since any individual can enter
this market and there's

191
00:18:58,042 --> 00:19:02,542
potential for lemon markets
where people are going to rip
you off, we had a number of

192
00:19:02,542 --> 00:19:09,000
complaints in two of our forums
so we designated them as ripping
forums. Places where if you go

193
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:13,417
there to buy data, you're going
to get ripped off. That's a
common term used within the

194
00:19:13,417 --> 00:19:18,083
market itself. If you are a
ripper you are a bad guy. We
just want to deal with people

195
00:19:18,083 --> 00:19:23,583
who are going to get us our
money and get us our data and
everyone makes a profit. So you

196
00:19:23,583 --> 00:19:28,292
want to avoid rip off artists.
When you exclude two of the
ripping forums from our data set

197
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:34,500
the proportion of products
change dramatically. Dumps are
still number one. Cash out

198
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:41,917
services become more prevalent,
other products, could be
consumer equipment, different

199
00:19:41,917 --> 00:19:47,917
accounts or other products.
Malware jumps up quite a bit
dedicated hosting services drop.

200
00:19:51,625 --> 00:19:58,542
EBay and PayPal jumps up quite a
bit. So there are differences
when we think about the products

201
00:19:58,542 --> 00:20:05,042
and quality of sellers within
any given market So to continue
with the idea of dumps for a

202
00:20:05,042 --> 00:20:12,208
moment, given that they can come
anywhere we ran an analysis to
see the pricing differentials by

203
00:20:12,208 --> 00:20:18,500
country. Given that the US was
one of the most prevalent in our
data set. We tried to see what

204
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:21,167
the average price was and how
pricing differs by country. So
we took a logged price for each

205
00:20:21,167 --> 00:20:27,167
specific item to remove
variation in prices and
separated them by Asia, U.S,

206
00:20:32,083 --> 00:20:38,708
Canada or different regions and
compared the two. What's
interesting to note is that U.S.

207
00:20:38,708 --> 00:20:45,917
data for dumps was cheaper than
other countries. Same for the UK
and even Canada to a certain

208
00:20:45,917 --> 00:20:50,333
extent. These are statistically
significant differences. That is
if you are going to buy data

209
00:20:50,333 --> 00:20:56,167
from a different country, the
U.S. and UK are going to be
cheaper than other countries. If

210
00:20:56,167 --> 00:21:00,083
you think about the quantity of
mass data breaches that we've
had in the last few years, that

211
00:21:00,083 --> 00:21:05,000
might be part of it because the
market has been flooded by data
from these nations. Plus we have

212
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:11,167
lower standards for security and
for use of payment mechanisms.
So there are real variations

213
00:21:11,167 --> 00:21:18,208
that are evident. Moving from
products let's stick with the
sales process itself. An ad goes

214
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:24,208
up. Once the ad goes up the
individual contacts the buyer
and all sales happen outside of

215
00:21:27,167 --> 00:21:32,917
the forum. This is important
because it makes it hard for us
to understand how much the price

216
00:21:32,917 --> 00:21:38,458
is for any given data. That's
part of why these limits are
present in a lot of the research

217
00:21:38,458 --> 00:21:42,583
out there. What an advertised
price is could be radically
different from what a person

218
00:21:42,583 --> 00:21:49,625
paid. Generally we know all of
the exchanges are going to take
place through E‑mail or ICQ

219
00:21:49,625 --> 00:21:55,833
which is 50 percent of the
preferred mechanisms for
contact. And the various systems

220
00:21:55,833 --> 00:22:00,958
we saw were electronic primarily
like Liberty Reserve or
WebMoney. We also saw a

221
00:22:00,958 --> 00:22:06,667
proportion taking Western Union
or MoneyGram. Some sellers that
accepted Western Union payments

222
00:22:06,667 --> 00:22:11,000
ratcheted up the price by 10 to
20 percent. The rationale
meaning they had to have an

223
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:15,125
intermediarial work with them or
in some way they had to have
someone physically show up to a

224
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:22,542
location to get cash so it made
it harder. There's another point
here, escrow payments. This was

225
00:22:22,542 --> 00:22:28,792
offered but at a small
percentage and within a few of
the forums. Escrow payments were

226
00:22:28,792 --> 00:22:34,000
present for those boards that
had a good degree of
organization and had a lot of

227
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:40,000
trust between the participants.
This is an example of Guarantor
service. The guarantor of a

228
00:22:42,792 --> 00:22:47,125
forum has been created so that
you will not be deceived. By
conducting a transaction with a

229
00:22:47,125 --> 00:22:51,708
guarantor you know you can
trust. Here's the terms. Buyer
and seller reach an agreement

230
00:22:51,708 --> 00:22:56,458
working through a guarantor.
Someone who has specifically
designated by that forum as the

231
00:22:56,458 --> 00:23:02,042
guarantor. The buyer contacts
the seller and using the
guarantor they get in touch with

232
00:23:02,042 --> 00:23:08,083
the ICQ. One of the parties
gives money to the guarantor and
the other the goods. The party

233
00:23:08,083 --> 00:23:13,583
holds the money in reserves.
Once the money is there and the
data is sent each individual

234
00:23:13,583 --> 00:23:19,583
party gets what they paid for in
this case data to the buyer,
money to the seller and that

235
00:23:22,333 --> 00:23:27,250
gives a way to ensure
everybody's happy. Otherwise you
don't know who you are working

236
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:33,625
with or who you can trust. As a
result grantors are there to
ensure everyone gets what they

237
00:23:33,625 --> 00:23:38,875
want. And grantors also get a
little bit of takes, you can see
guarantors services are free for

238
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:41,167
up to $30 but once you go up to
$500 it's prorated 8%. So the
more you buy the less you have

239
00:23:41,167 --> 00:23:47,167
to pay the guarantor. This idea
of trust is really important.
It's odd to think about illicit

240
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:55,750
markets because we don't think
about thieves having honor or
trust but within these markets

241
00:24:00,792 --> 00:24:07,958
that's the way people get things
done. In fact since sales take
place out of the forum it's hard

242
00:24:07,958 --> 00:24:14,458
to know how an exchange goes and
that's why individuals offer
feedback. If you buy something

243
00:24:14,458 --> 00:24:18,250
from someone there's a
reasonable expectation that you
are going to go back into the

244
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:23,667
forum into that person's thread
and explain how it worked, how
it went and what you thought of

245
00:24:23,667 --> 00:24:28,333
the data and services. That way
the seller can validate their
reputation and the buyers can

246
00:24:28,333 --> 00:24:34,583
demonstrate how things went so
it's a way to be open and
transparent in the marketplace.

247
00:24:34,583 --> 00:24:40,292
This is one example of some
feedback that was provided. This
went to a money launderer

248
00:24:40,292 --> 00:24:45,292
service. They said the Thread
Started laundered $300, the
speed is comparable to the

249
00:24:45,292 --> 00:24:51,000
second cosmic speed. Everything
was magnificent, I'll go back.
The next person said I did some

250
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:55,667
laundering of money from a
female partner,, everything was
quick ad excellent, and the

251
00:24:55,667 --> 00:24:59,125
Thread Started takes a small
percentage which makes everybody
happy. You can imagine if you

252
00:24:59,125 --> 00:25:04,208
were working in Amazon or eBay
this is the feedback you would
want to see for a reliable

253
00:25:04,208 --> 00:25:11,458
vendor. It's the exact same
thing here. This leads to an
important thing to consider.

254
00:25:11,458 --> 00:25:17,458
	Negative feedback has the same
role in the marketplace. If you
don't think you can trust a

255
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:23,958
person read their feedback. If
it's negative you don't want to
work with that vendor. In this

256
00:25:23,958 --> 00:25:29,250
case this is a good example of
negative feedback. A person asks
has your service been tested or

257
00:25:29,250 --> 00:25:34,458
vouched? How do we know that we
can trust you? I can provide
potential business for you if I

258
00:25:34,458 --> 00:25:38,708
can trust you. Next person says
he's a ripper. Don't believe
him. He says his drops are from

259
00:25:38,708 --> 00:25:43,750
Florida. The seller says I'm no
ripper, I've never had a
complaint, this guy is just

260
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:48,042
trying to cause trouble. I've
never dealt with him before,
moderator please ban him. He's

261
00:25:48,042 --> 00:25:52,792
just trying to disrupt my
transaction. The next person
said, I contacted him on another

262
00:25:52,792 --> 00:25:58,250
forum, I asked him if he accepts
escrow for grantee, of course he
refused. this person won't work

263
00:25:58,250 --> 00:26:04,000
with a guarantor, I don't think
we can trust him. The negative
feedback if it stacks up can get

264
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:11,750
them completely blocked from a
forum. Moderators and
individuals who are engaging in

265
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:14,917
transactions don't want to deal
with people who are just messing
around. People want their money,

266
00:26:14,917 --> 00:26:20,042
products and they want a
successful outcome. This is as
much a legitimate business using

267
00:26:20,042 --> 00:26:27,250
certain business practices like
customer service in order to get
people to use illegal products

268
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:32,542
to engage in identity theft and
cyber crime. So this is an
important issue. When we think

269
00:26:32,542 --> 00:26:38,500
about organization we've got a
participatory experience with
regard to transactions. Buyers

270
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:45,375
and sellers interact. Buyers get
the potential to give everyone
feedback through the use of the

271
00:26:45,375 --> 00:26:49,375
positive or negative reviews.
That affects the way that
sellers are perceived in the

272
00:26:49,375 --> 00:26:55,167
market. This also creates an
additional layer of complexity.
Not only do we have guarantors

273
00:26:55,167 --> 00:26:59,958
operating but some of our
forums, those that are
sophisticated have guarantors

274
00:26:59,958 --> 00:27:06,083
forums, etc, will even provide
product reviews and testing and
that affects all the

275
00:27:06,083 --> 00:27:11,750
transactions. You might think
why would a forum provide a
check or validation process for

276
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:17,667
selling? Because they want
everyone to be satisfied and
this is just an example of one

277
00:27:17,667 --> 00:27:22,250
forum's checking process.
Checking your goods takes place
voluntarily or if the

278
00:27:22,250 --> 00:27:27,958
administrator of the forum
requires it. Checking is done by
one specific person, takes one

279
00:27:27,958 --> 00:27:34,542
to three days. After the check
the guarantor there will be no
stupid flames in the topic, like

280
00:27:34,542 --> 00:27:38,500
we showed earlier where the
person is trying to argue no,
we're a legititmate vendor. The

281
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:43,583
moderator will write a review on
this and close the topic. If a
requirement to provide your

282
00:27:43,583 --> 00:27:49,208
product or testing is refused
you are risking ban and your
announcement is erased. So

283
00:27:49,208 --> 00:27:55,667
either you play or you don't. If
you don't and you are asked to
play then this runs the risk of

284
00:27:55,667 --> 00:27:59,833
you being kicked out of the
board. No money is taken for
testing. This is interesting

285
00:27:59,833 --> 00:28:05,583
because unlike guarantor
services or escrow payments the
forum's completely doing this

286
00:28:05,583 --> 00:28:10,875
out of the goodness of their
heart for participants involved.
They want to make sure that

287
00:28:10,875 --> 00:28:14,792
everyone is satisfied with the
outcome. You provide the
products for the test in the

288
00:28:14,792 --> 00:28:19,250
same configuration in which you
sell it. You give it to us
exactly as you would give it to

289
00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:23,708
the buyer. A good review is
going to go a long way because
it demonstrates that you are

290
00:28:23,708 --> 00:28:28,542
trustworthy. In some cases
forums will designate an
individual as a verified seller.

291
00:28:28,542 --> 00:28:33,333
A verified vendor of a specific
product. That's its type of
person you know you want to go

292
00:28:33,333 --> 00:28:39,875
to because they're not going to
cheat you or rip you off This
creates an additional layer of

293
00:28:39,875 --> 00:28:44,500
complexity. And when we think
about all of the encounters, not
only do we have the potential

294
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:50,625
for checking and testing but our
best forums also had a good
degree of administrative

295
00:28:50,625 --> 00:28:57,417
oversight. In that case forums
would actively go in and disrupt
or remove vendors on the on the

296
00:28:57,417 --> 00:29:03,167
basis of negative feedback. This
is an example of just one of the
forums rules on how vendors get

297
00:29:03,167 --> 00:29:09,500
banned or blocked or how
complaints are processed. They
say if the transaction has been

298
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:16,625
carried out it has to be
confirmed. If you leave a
fictitious review you will be

299
00:29:16,625 --> 00:29:23,292
banned perhaps even permanently.
You can't just come in and junk
up the thread and make

300
00:29:23,292 --> 00:29:30,750
complaints. They have to be
validated. They're going to want
you to post logs proving guilt

301
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:35,000
and what they're saying is they
want the ICQ logs of your
conversation with the person.

302
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:39,792
They want to see how exactly it
went down. You can't just say
this person is a ripper or a rip

303
00:29:39,792 --> 00:29:44,792
off artist. You have to
provide validation. In the last
part, users with one to ten

304
00:29:44,792 --> 00:29:48,500
messages that have not been on
the forum for long will be
deleted at the discretion of the

305
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:53,750
moderator. That means if you are
a seller you can't create five
accounts and say this guy is

306
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:59,625
great, I've worked with him
before because those will be
removed. This has an important

307
00:29:59,625 --> 00:30:05,167
implication. In some of the
recent publications regarding
how we might disrupt stolen data

308
00:30:05,167 --> 00:30:10,208
markets some people have argued
for a civil attack procedures,
where you go in and post

309
00:30:10,208 --> 00:30:14,667
anything that makes it hard for
sellers to interact and for
buyers to know who to trust. A

310
00:30:14,667 --> 00:30:20,667
civil attack is only going to be
effective in those disorganized
forums. The ones heavily managed

311
00:30:25,167 --> 00:30:30,125
will figure out what's going on
and block the individual, block
the account.If you're doing it

312
00:30:30,125 --> 00:30:35,125
from a specific computer, the
computer itself might even be
banned. So better organized

313
00:30:35,125 --> 00:30:40,417
forums may not be disrupted by a
civil attack. If it is effective
it will probably only be for a

314
00:30:40,417 --> 00:30:47,583
short period of time. So we have
to think what we're going to do
about a disorganized market That

315
00:30:47,583 --> 00:30:52,875
leads us to a final point about
Organization. We have
individuals working in a

316
00:30:52,875 --> 00:30:59,250
collegial fashion to engage in
transactions. We have a peer
process where individuals are

317
00:30:59,250 --> 00:31:05,750
being reviewed, vetted, tested,
challenged. At a macro level
where we divorce ourselves from

318
00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:11,500
the individual transactions and
think about interaction we're
dealing with what we might think

319
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:17,500
of as formal organizations. As a
moderator who provides a place
for people to buy and sell data.

320
00:31:21,208 --> 00:31:26,750
They also offer a good degree of
managerial structure that is to
an extent that is hierarchical.

321
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:31,750
And there are interconnections
between our forums. Some of the
better vendors would say I

322
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:36,375
advertise on the following
sites, you can see my reviews
there as a way of demonstrating

323
00:31:36,375 --> 00:31:41,667
I am trustworthy and reputable
so this kind of cross form
interaction is important. And

324
00:31:41,667 --> 00:31:48,042
finally duration over time. Four
of our five forums we had posts
over a five year window. If you

325
00:31:48,042 --> 00:31:53,625
look at a date of an
individual's post some of them
went back to 2004. So we're

326
00:31:53,625 --> 00:31:58,000
talking about a long period of
time where some of the groups
have been active. That's a very

327
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,792
important thing when we're
talking about market disruption.
If you have a group that's been

328
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:07,208
active for a decade they might
be harder to disrupt than one
that's been active for three

329
00:32:07,208 --> 00:32:12,750
months or one that has come up
and gone away. So there's a
definitive difference in the

330
00:32:12,750 --> 00:32:18,625
types of markets we see. What
I'll do now is transition away
from the Organizational issues

331
00:32:18,625 --> 00:32:22,500
and I'm going to talk for a
moment about the economic impact
of the markets. We've talked

332
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:28,292
about pricing and the way in
which products are bought and
sold. So, let's take just a

333
00:32:28,292 --> 00:32:33,833
second and look at the potential
money that people might make.
There's a lot of data being

334
00:32:33,833 --> 00:32:39,833
sold. How much can an individual
reasonably make? In order to
come to these conclusions since

335
00:32:39,833 --> 00:32:44,292
we can't necessarily know how
many transactions were
successfully completed what

336
00:32:44,292 --> 00:32:49,958
we've done is added up all
positive and negative feedback
that an individual received.

337
00:32:49,958 --> 00:32:55,375
That has potential for error.
There could be fictitious
reviews and false positives in

338
00:32:55,375 --> 00:33:01,375
the data. There could be one
potential way to understand how
many instances the transaction

339
00:33:01,375 --> 00:33:07,125
took place. As you can see with
dumps we had 190 instances of
transactions from our

340
00:33:07,125 --> 00:33:13,125
non‑ripping forum and 67 in our
ripping forums so 257 dumps or
transactions that took place. We

341
00:33:15,833 --> 00:33:23,167
have 63 for CVVs, the majority
of them coming from the ripping
forums, reinforcing that our

342
00:33:23,167 --> 00:33:28,583
data point from earlier. On bank
accounts the majority come from
ripping forums. From eBay

343
00:33:28,583 --> 00:33:34,250
and PayPal accounts we saw 6
from non-ripping forums and 3
from ripping forums. So this

344
00:33:34,250 --> 00:33:40,250
gives us some degree of how many
transactions might have taken
place. Another problem that

345
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:45,375
comes up though is this excludes
anyone who didn't have a product
review. They may have had no

346
00:33:45,375 --> 00:33:50,917
feedback. They could have had
transactions but we didn't
capture the product reviews in

347
00:33:50,917 --> 00:33:55,250
our data points so there's
potential for bias there and I
will talk about how we tried to

348
00:33:55,250 --> 00:34:02,250
correct that in just a second.
Taking those metrics we tried to
overlay some of the pricing

349
00:34:02,250 --> 00:34:07,000
metrics. Thinking about our
average cost for data and the
total number of transactions

350
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:12,250
that take place. With our dump
sellers many specified they
wanted to sell data in large

351
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:17,792
amounts. In some cases their
minimum quantity buy might have
been a hundred. So we tried to

352
00:34:17,792 --> 00:34:22,667
set up base lines for how many
pieces an individual might have
purchased in the course of a

353
00:34:22,667 --> 00:34:29,042
transaction. For Dumps, we took
100 dumps per transaction.
Taking the average cost, if you

354
00:34:29,042 --> 00:34:35,042
buying $102 for 100 dumps your
average would be $10,260, for
CVVs, taking 50 accounts that is

355
00:34:38,583 --> 00:34:45,792
an average cost of $1,310. For
eBay and PayPAl accounts
thinking again about 50 that

356
00:34:45,792 --> 00:34:51,792
gives us $1,362.50 average. If
we multiplied the number of
transactions by the amount of

357
00:34:54,833 --> 00:35:02,792
money that we expect has taken
place this gives us some pretty
dramatic estimates for profit.

358
00:35:02,792 --> 00:35:09,833
In the case of dumps we're
looking at $2,636,000. That's a
staggering amount of money. That

359
00:35:09,833 --> 00:35:16,792
leads to the potential that
there's no way your math is
right on that. You could argue

360
00:35:16,792 --> 00:35:22,917
that. So if we take the median
price for dumps, not the mean
that's $40. At that rate we're

361
00:35:22,917 --> 00:35:28,917
still looking at a million
dollars in total transactions.
If we want to throttle that a

362
00:35:31,917 --> 00:35:38,167
little and say all right we're
probably getting false positive.
If we're only getting 65% of the

363
00:35:38,167 --> 00:35:44,167
feedback that was received that
puts us somewhere in the
neighborhood of $668,000 or

364
00:35:48,250 --> 00:35:54,250
$1,000,713 so we're still
talking about a substantial
profit for dumps sells. We're

365
00:35:56,792 --> 00:36:04,458
not disaggregating rippers from
non‑rippers either. This means
how much money one vendor could

366
00:36:04,458 --> 00:36:09,375
make. This gives us total
economic estimate. We could run
this is couple of different ways

367
00:36:09,375 --> 00:36:16,958
but this is a potential for loss
that we wanted to highlight So
sellers could make a substantial

368
00:36:16,958 --> 00:36:23,958
amount of money. We might argue
this is a seller's market. If we
take the number of buyers that

369
00:36:23,958 --> 00:36:30,333
provided positive feedback that
gives us a different sense of
how things go. FOr non-ripping

370
00:36:30,333 --> 00:36:37,125
dumps we only had 117 instances
of positive feedback and our
ripping forums only 24 people

371
00:36:37,125 --> 00:36:44,000
had a satisfactory encounter. So
there's a difference in what
individuals report. Buyers are

372
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:51,292
not going to come out as good
when we compare it with dumps
vendors. Let's try to figure out

373
00:36:51,292 --> 00:36:59,042
how much money a prospective
dumps buyer might make. If
you've ever read any of the

374
00:36:59,042 --> 00:37:05,208
reports, you know that they
provide potential loss metric
per person. It's $188 in the

375
00:37:05,208 --> 00:37:13,042
2013 report but it varies from
time to time. What we've tried
to do here is take an amount

376
00:37:13,042 --> 00:37:18,083
reported by the Bureau of
Justice Statistics for identity
theft. Victimization. For a

377
00:37:18,083 --> 00:37:25,500
credit card losses in the US in
2012 Victims reported an average
loss of $1,448. The median was

378
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:31,333
only 300. When we compared it
against debit cards losses we're
talking about $500 versus $200,

379
00:37:31,333 --> 00:37:37,167
so there is some difference.
Let's talk about the return on
investment for a dumps for a

380
00:37:37,167 --> 00:37:44,250
dumps buyer then. If we had 117
instances of positive feedback.
Just assume for a second try to

381
00:37:44,250 --> 00:37:50,000
throttle the amounts that they
received, that only 65 cards
they buy are valid and depending

382
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:54,542
on what metric you want to use
this creates a lot of different
outcomes. But if we take the

383
00:37:54,542 --> 00:38:00,542
credit card loss average we're
talking about $94,000 in gain
per transaction so 8 on the ROI.

384
00:38:02,667 --> 00:38:08,667
If we take the median the ROI
drops dramatically. But buyers
have the potential to gain

385
00:38:11,708 --> 00:38:18,542
somewhere in the neighborhood of
$2,281,000 which isn't bad but
not as good as we might see with

386
00:38:18,542 --> 00:38:25,375
regards to dumps vendors. If we
take the debit card amount using
the median loss we're looking at

387
00:38:25,375 --> 00:38:30,167
buyers acquiring somewhere in
the neighborhood of $1.5 million
so it's a different type of

388
00:38:30,167 --> 00:38:35,625
metric depending on what you do.
Thinking strategically. Maybe
dumps aren't the way to go.

389
00:38:35,625 --> 00:38:37,958
Let's just say you use eBay and
PayPal for a moment. Let's
assume the 25 pieces you buy

390
00:38:37,958 --> 00:38:43,958
from an eBay or Pay Pal vendor
are active. The ROI is way
better in these instances than

391
00:38:48,250 --> 00:38:53,750
for any other type of
transaction. In this case it
could be $36,000 per transaction

392
00:38:53,750 --> 00:39:00,125
using the credit card loss
average or 13,000 if we use the
debit loss average. So there are

393
00:39:00,125 --> 00:39:05,583
dramatic differences here and it
would strike people, hopefully
in the audience, that the better

394
00:39:05,583 --> 00:39:10,750
way to go is to be a vendor and
not a buyer. Because at least
you are always going to make a

395
00:39:10,750 --> 00:39:16,708
profit whether or not your data
works. someone who buys from you
may not know you're disreputable

396
00:39:16,708 --> 00:39:21,750
but they're going to pay you
anyway. So this economy is one
that is very very complicated.

397
00:39:21,750 --> 00:39:27,250
unfortunately we're running out
of time so I'm going to have to
skip over the social network

398
00:39:27,250 --> 00:39:32,750
analysis portion of this but we
can talk about it more in depth
later. Generally, what's the

399
00:39:32,750 --> 00:39:38,208
take away from all of this. When
we think about the markets
themselves they are organized in

400
00:39:38,208 --> 00:39:42,583
a unique fashion. At the
individual level we're talking
about a process where we're

401
00:39:42,583 --> 00:39:48,208
seeing peers and colleagues. At
the formal forum level we're
seeing a more formal

402
00:39:48,208 --> 00:39:54,250
organization that takes place.
The variation in terms of market
sophistication will tell us

403
00:39:54,250 --> 00:39:59,042
these markets are insufficient.
We're going to see different
individuals acting different

404
00:39:59,042 --> 00:40:04,833
based on their status based on
what they're told based on forum
moderators or administrators.

405
00:40:04,833 --> 00:40:09,292
When we think about market
disruption, given all of this,
it's probably going to be a more

406
00:40:09,292 --> 00:40:14,375
effective strategy from a law
enforcement perspective, or a
more strategic point of view,

407
00:40:14,375 --> 00:40:19,208
the better way to go after these
markets based on how they're
organized is to take out the

408
00:40:19,208 --> 00:40:25,958
entire forum. Given the number
of dumps vendors and product
sales that take place, one

409
00:40:25,958 --> 00:40:30,250
individual can jump in and take
over another person's share of
the market. We have to think

410
00:40:30,250 --> 00:40:35,708
critically how do we affect
individuals? A one on one basis
removal is not going to work.

411
00:40:35,708 --> 00:40:40,458
Civil attacks are going to fail
most likely in a better
organized forums. Something like

412
00:40:40,458 --> 00:40:46,958
a dark market procedure where
law enforcement sets up and runs
the entire forum. Taking out the

413
00:40:46,958 --> 00:40:51,292
entire site is going to have a
much more dramatic impact than
just occasionally removing a

414
00:40:51,292 --> 00:40:58,708
seller. Another alternative
strategy might be to go after
the payment processers that were

415
00:40:58,708 --> 00:41:03,125
used. Taking out Liberty
Resevere for instance, has had
some chilling effect on the

416
00:41:03,125 --> 00:41:07,750
market. It's very, very short
term but it's going to make an
impact because that means they

417
00:41:07,750 --> 00:41:13,167
have to transition to another
service. That poses other
challenges but it's an

418
00:41:13,167 --> 00:41:19,583
alternative venue that may have
a longer effect on markets
disrupting. In general this is

419
00:41:19,583 --> 00:41:24,292
something we can look at in a
much, much more broad
perspective. But with all the

420
00:41:24,292 --> 00:41:28,750
data that we have, one of the
most important things I can tell
you from all of this is the need

421
00:41:28,750 --> 00:41:34,250
for greater participation and
collaboration. As an academic
we're getting one‑half of the

422
00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:40,083
pie. We can see what goes on in
markets but not the individual
exchanges between people outside

423
00:41:40,083 --> 00:41:44,750
of the forums. If we can set up
better relationships with law
enforcement and industry we

424
00:41:44,750 --> 00:41:49,542
could get a different
perspective on what's going on.
For instance, if we could have a

425
00:41:49,542 --> 00:41:54,625
direct partnership with law
enforcement or industry partners
we could look at trying to

426
00:41:54,625 --> 00:42:01,708
disrupt a market and do
evaluation so at the time a site
goes down we can look at where

427
00:42:01,708 --> 00:42:07,292
people go to. This idea of
displacement, if you take out a
market, individuals who are

428
00:42:07,292 --> 00:42:11,083
interested are going to go
somewhere else. Where do they go
and how quickly do they move

429
00:42:11,083 --> 00:42:16,625
there? We can assess disruption
and what it does to the markets
in a broad way. We can get some

430
00:42:16,625 --> 00:42:22,667
of the external communications
through ICQ and other media; and
we can do different processes of

431
00:42:22,667 --> 00:42:28,292
analysis with that information.
In general, we're going to try
to do a lot more with this data.

432
00:42:28,292 --> 00:42:33,417
We're going to try to compare
our economic stuff with the
social analysis and see whats

433
00:42:33,417 --> 00:42:37,625
going on. We're going to through
IRC channels and a few other
sites to and try to create an

434
00:42:37,625 --> 00:42:43,833
even larger data set and we
would like to compare with some
of the sites and compare them to

435
00:42:43,833 --> 00:42:50,375
what we see in more active
markets. So there is a lot that
we can do from here. With that

436
00:42:50,375 --> 00:42:56,375
in mind I will go ahead and
stop. Does anybody have any
questions? Yes, sir. [off mic]

437
00:43:07,375 --> 00:43:10,500
[inaudible] >> Sure. The
question is when people were
selling credit reports what were

438
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:16,000
they actually offering? What we
saw were people offering credit
report services so they would do

439
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:22,000
checks not credit report dumps.
Any other questions? Yes, sir.
[off mic] >> He asked what was

440
00:43:26,792 --> 00:43:31,000
the average age of accounts? No
one provided us with that
information so we couldn't tell

441
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:37,000
without actually buying the
data. Any other questions? Yes,
sir. [off mic] >> So if I

442
00:43:46,125 --> 00:43:52,125
understand correctly, the
question is what do sellers do
to review moderators? So the

443
00:43:58,917 --> 00:44:03,333
question is how do sellers get
into the market and how do they
operate? The better organized

444
00:44:03,333 --> 00:44:08,458
forums will stipulate the terms
for transactions or at least how
things should go. They can't

445
00:44:08,458 --> 00:44:12,208
guarantee that you have to work
that way, sellers have the
ability to say I'm going to do

446
00:44:12,208 --> 00:44:17,000
this, not that so there's
variation that is allowed at the
individual level but generally

447
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:21,083
speaking the disorganized boards
on our site were like the wild
west, you could do whatever you

448
00:44:21,083 --> 00:44:26,542
wanted. There's no necessary
reason why someone would have to
act a certain way. If anybody

449
00:44:26,542 --> 00:44:32,542
else has any other questions
come on up or I can go to the
chill out room and we can set

450
00:44:36,792 --> 00:44:40,208
things up that way. Thank you.
[Applause]
