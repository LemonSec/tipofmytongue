00:00:00,042 --> 00:00:04,083
>>My name is Joe Grand, I do
computer stuff, I do electronic
stuff, I designed a few years of

2
00:00:04,083 --> 00:00:10,083
DEFCON's electronic badges.
14-18. Today is a talk that I've
been really wanting to do for a

3
00:00:17,875 --> 00:00:21,750
really long time, and that's
look at different ways to get
access to inner layers of

4
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:26,625
circuit boards to help with
reverse engineering. So, we see
a lot about chip-hacking that

5
00:00:26,625 --> 00:00:33,833
Chris does at a really
microscopic chip level. We see a
lot of hardware hacking,

6
00:00:33,833 --> 00:00:39,125
embedded systems, component
level, connecting up through
JTAG interfaces and through UART

7
00:00:39,125 --> 00:00:44,083
ports and all sorts of stuff
which is slightly higher level,
but we never really look at the

8
00:00:44,083 --> 00:00:49,958
board level. And this is
something that I've really
wanted to do for a long time, so

9
00:00:49,958 --> 00:00:54,833
I'm excited to give this and
lucky that I guess I convinced
enough people at DEFCON to let

10
00:00:54,833 --> 00:01:02,417
me give it. So just to get
started, reverse engineers PT
boards isn't that much different

11
00:01:02,417 --> 00:01:09,750
than anything else, except we
look at the circuit board. We're
undesigning a system that's

12
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:14,542
already been built. In this case
for this work, I'm sort of
assuming a black box type of

13
00:01:14,542 --> 00:01:20,125
scenario. Maybe we open up a
product and access a circuit
board in the field that we want

14
00:01:20,125 --> 00:01:26,250
to figure out what's going on
with it. So we take that system,
and we use destructive methods

15
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:31,125
and nondestructive methods
whatever we need, depending on
the situation so get all the

16
00:01:31,125 --> 00:01:37,333
information about the board so
we can go and perform an attack
or do SGLGS something else. The

17
00:01:37,333 --> 00:01:42,875
main ways soldier to access each
individual copper layer, which
is the primary thing I'm most

18
00:01:42,875 --> 00:01:47,958
excited about. Once you get
those, if you get each layer of
the board, sometimes they have a

19
00:01:47,958 --> 00:01:53,917
multi‑ layer board, and I'll
describe the kind of typical
board composition. You can kind

20
00:01:53,917 --> 00:01:58,417
of lay those out together and
stack them in just (?) and do
imagine processing types of

21
00:01:58,417 --> 00:02:04,417
things to trace out connections.
Once you do that, you can say
this part connected to this part

22
00:02:04,417 --> 00:02:10,583
and maybe micro controllers
connected to international
memory to give you an idea about

23
00:02:10,583 --> 00:02:16,583
what's going on. Oh, yeah, also
besides the obvious sorts of
things figuring out how the

24
00:02:18,583 --> 00:02:24,583
system works, good to verify
security schemes of things. What
I really like about this is

25
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,375
injecting kind of new behavior
into a device. This is something
that's like, yeah, of course you

26
00:02:32,375 --> 00:02:37,125
have the standard research type
of things or forensic analysis
or whatever. If you have the

27
00:02:37,125 --> 00:02:41,125
board design, you have the
fingerprint of the board. If you
have that board level, you have

28
00:02:41,125 --> 00:02:49,125
firmware and other things. Lots
of governments have been doing
it for quite some time, and they

29
00:02:49,125 --> 00:02:57,000
must use the techniques I'm
assuming. It's interesting area
because now you take a board,

30
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,333
delayer it and figure out what's
going on and find a good
location to inject something

31
00:03:01,333 --> 00:03:07,458
that isn't going to be detected.
Whether it's enabling some new
feature, whether it's some

32
00:03:07,458 --> 00:03:13,583
surreptitious monitoring or
whatever it is, people don't
think if somebody changed the

33
00:03:13,583 --> 00:03:18,083
board layout between the time I
sent the board out to fab and
the time it came back from

34
00:03:18,083 --> 00:03:23,167
China. No one is thinking about
that. At chip layer maybe.
There's all sorts of kind of

35
00:03:23,167 --> 00:03:28,292
gray mart areas for chips, but
circuit boards, you don't think
if someone adds functionality to

36
00:03:28,292 --> 00:03:34,292
a board, but you should. So we
look at three different
sections. I've broken this out.

37
00:03:37,833 --> 00:03:43,875
The first soldering, thing is
getting access to the top or
bottom layers of the circuit

38
00:03:43,875 --> 00:03:49,250
board. Then we look at
delayering for multi‑ layer
boards to how to figure out and

39
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:54,542
get access to each individual
layer of the board. Then imaging
with nondestructive types of

40
00:03:54,542 --> 00:04:01,667
stuff. A lot of tools we look at
here are not that impressive,
but it's just never been talked

41
00:04:01,667 --> 00:04:08,125
about. So we have manual some
manual methods and chemicals.
All these different things are

42
00:04:08,125 --> 00:04:14,125
cool to put in one spot. And a
lot of thing we use are design
for failure analysis, so they're

43
00:04:16,958 --> 00:04:21,417
engineering tools that
legitimate designers are using
and legitimate fabricators are

44
00:04:21,417 --> 00:04:25,833
using that we're using for
hacking hardware and for reverse
engineers and that's what we can

45
00:04:25,833 --> 00:04:31,208
do a lot. Take advantage of
tools out there and use them to
our advantage. Just work was

46
00:04:31,208 --> 00:04:36,667
done for a cyber fast track
project so our tax dollars at
work to play with circuit

47
00:04:36,667 --> 00:04:42,667
boards, which is awesome. I was
going to do it anyway. I didn't
tell them that. So before we can

48
00:04:47,083 --> 00:04:51,958
actually start getting access to
the layers and start doing some
of these techniques, we need to

49
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:56,667
understand how a circuit board
is put together. How many are
familiar with circuit boards and

50
00:04:56,667 --> 00:05:02,750
how they're built? About half.
How many have designed a circuit
board? About the same half.

51
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:09,750
Okay. Cool. I guess that makes
sense. Okay. Half of you guys
are familiar with it and half

52
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:15,583
aren't. That's pretty good.
Circuit boards are basically a
sandwich of layers. So you have

53
00:05:15,583 --> 00:05:19,958
your insulating layers and your
copper layers. Your top layer is
copper and then you have your

54
00:05:19,958 --> 00:05:27,000
insulating layer. So I call it a
circuit board sandwich and made
a shirt just for the occasion. I

55
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:32,083
don't know if you can see it
from way in the board. Circuit
board sandwich. Circuit boards

56
00:05:32,083 --> 00:05:39,625
are awesome. So this is  ‑ ‑ the
circuit board provides a
physical carrier, so you have

57
00:05:39,625 --> 00:05:45,792
all the components that go on
the board with the physical
carrier where the component

58
00:05:45,792 --> 00:05:50,958
connects on the board and they
provide the electrical pathways.
If you figure out what they are,

59
00:05:50,958 --> 00:05:55,250
you can do the reverse
engineering. This picture on the
right this cross‑ section is a

60
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:57,250
16‑ layer board I happened to
pull out of my stack of circuit
boards, and it's a cross‑

61
00:05:57,250 --> 00:06:01,000
section. So we're looking at
each individual layer from the
side‑ view. There's a bunch of 

62
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:07,917
-- I don't know what it is. I
can't do the math in my head.
There's thin layers and two

63
00:06:07,917 --> 00:06:13,917
thick layers in the middle and a
bunch of other ones. If you do a
cross‑ section not uncommon,

64
00:06:24,708 --> 00:06:29,417
sometimes you can do it from the
edge of the board so you can see
and try to get an idea of

65
00:06:29,417 --> 00:06:32,417
interlayer spacing. The inter
layers are thicker that means
power or ground planes or

66
00:06:32,417 --> 00:06:36,375
something carrying high current
there. The picture on the left
is an awesome, awesome thing if

67
00:06:36,375 --> 00:06:43,292
you can ever get it. It's the
Dutch Indonesian specNell, which
is an awesome layer cake and not

68
00:06:43,292 --> 00:06:51,250
a PC board and taste much better
than PC boards. I can guarantee
this. I ordered this at a

69
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:57,583
restaurant in the Netherlands.
And I didn't know what it was.
They brought it, and I was like

70
00:06:57,583 --> 00:07:02,792
oh, my God, this is awesome. I'm
putting it in my presentation.
Now you know what circuit boards

71
00:07:02,792 --> 00:07:08,958
look like. There's a bunch of
other layers on a board. You
have your copper and substrate

72
00:07:08,958 --> 00:07:14,708
layers, but you have other
stuff. There's a silk‑ screen
layer usually for markings on

73
00:07:14,708 --> 00:07:20,417
the board, and sometimes other
colors. That's made of a
printable ink or epoxy. Usually

74
00:07:20,417 --> 00:07:25,625
part designators are on there,
sometimes you see manufacturing
logos and sometimes markings by

75
00:07:25,625 --> 00:07:32,708
engineers for testers, things to
take advantage of it. That's at
the super top layer. The next

76
00:07:32,708 --> 00:07:38,833
layer down, the solder mask ,
coating that makes the coatings
green or white or blue or

77
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:45,625
whatever, basically the
protective layer that protects
any area of the copper that is

78
00:07:45,625 --> 00:07:51,875
not intended to be exposed. If
you look at your Defcon badges,
all those copper pads, those

79
00:07:51,875 --> 00:07:56,792
copper circles are intentionally
made to be exposed. You can
solder to them and tap onto them

80
00:07:56,792 --> 00:08:01,250
and do things. If you look
carefully you can see a bunch of
trailers underneath the actual

81
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:06,875
solder mask, and those are not
intended to hack on. That
doesn't mean you're not allowed

82
00:08:06,875 --> 00:08:12,583
to go there and do it. It means
the engineer doesn't want you to
access those and protects the

83
00:08:12,583 --> 00:08:17,667
board from dust and erosion and
a bunch of other stuff. We need
to deal with that solder mask

84
00:08:17,667 --> 00:08:23,667
later. The circuit board fab is
almost approaching like high
feature size chips, like you're

85
00:08:26,667 --> 00:08:34,208
getting so  ‑ ‑ these tiny, fine
features so the state‑ of‑ the‑
art costs less than 1 mill,

86
00:08:34,208 --> 00:08:40,208
1/1000 - thousandth of an inch.
Which is amazing density. Half a
mill, less of half a mill

87
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:59,833
diameter laser drill holes.
Circuit boards are highly
complex. They're amazing. Avia

88
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:05,833
inpad connects different layers
today. Normally in a traditional
PC board fab you have it going

89
00:09:08,667 --> 00:09:10,667
through the board say it
connects layers 2 and 6 of the
board. It's still going to go

90
00:09:10,667 --> 00:09:14,875
all the way through, because
it's an easier fabrication
process. When we have avia pad

91
00:09:14,875 --> 00:09:20,875
or buried via, you can't find
the via sometimes. It's insane.
Via and pad is like you have a

92
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:34,250
highly integrated device where
there's a matrix of solder balls
underneath the part. If that pad

93
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:40,250
needs to connect to an inner
layer, it doesn't have to go OP
top layer somewhere else. It can

94
00:09:42,417 --> 00:09:47,750
have a via straight in the pad
and going straight down into an
inter layer, and you would never

95
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:51,792
see it unless you did some of
the techniques that we're going
to do. Very, very advanced

96
00:09:51,792 --> 00:09:57,792
capabilities, but normally we
look at traditional capabilities
tracer space, 8 mill mechanical

97
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:07,875
holes and buried vias and they
only connect the layers that
need connected. You can't access

98
00:10:07,875 --> 00:10:13,875
it from the outside. Just
amazing what PC board fab can do
right now. This picture is an

99
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:22,000
iPhone 4, a cross‑ section of
that. Ten‑ layer board and super
thin. What is it?   .75

100
00:10:26,542 --> 00:10:34,042
millimeters or something. Let me
convert that. 29.5 mills. 29.5,
so 30/1,000 of an inch thick.

101
00:10:34,042 --> 00:10:41,833
Ten layers. I didn't actually
convert that in my head, and I
have notes. Some can do math

102
00:10:41,833 --> 00:10:47,833
really fast, but I can't. Thank
you for joining us. You too,
fellas. Please sit down so I can

103
00:10:54,625 --> 00:11:02,292
continue so you don't interrupt
me anymore. I know them. It's
okay. Yeah, so this type of

104
00:11:02,292 --> 00:11:08,208
board is super complex, and I
use this iPhone board in a lot
of experiments. I wanted to use

105
00:11:08,208 --> 00:11:13,167
kind of traditional standard
board. I did some two‑ layer
boards and cut some six‑ layer

106
00:11:13,167 --> 00:11:18,417
boards and had complete control
over the design on each layer. I
knew the layer spacing, knew

107
00:11:18,417 --> 00:11:23,708
everything about it so I could
kind of validate the success of
the various techniques. Then the

108
00:11:23,708 --> 00:11:28,917
iPhone board is a real world
situation of an actual consumer
product using current state‑ of‑

109
00:11:28,917 --> 00:11:35,792
the‑ art technologies. So I
grabbed a bunch of these things
on eBay that were actually Apple

110
00:11:35,792 --> 00:11:41,500
iPhone knock‑off boards. They
looked grate and there were
noticeable defects and cracks in

111
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:47,500
them. I couldn't imagine someone
buying an iPhone board on bay  ‑
‑ bay and building it. It was

112
00:11:52,292 --> 00:11:58,292
fun to use this for a hobbyist
board to prove the technique
works for the real deal. So I

113
00:12:02,042 --> 00:12:06,958
mentioned we wanted to try to
get access to the inner layers
or all the layers of the circuit

114
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:12,250
board. If you do that, if you
can only access, say, the top
and bottom layers, that's still

115
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:16,583
better than nothing. If you get
all layers of the board, whether
it's a four‑ layer board or

116
00:12:16,583 --> 00:12:21,375
whatever, you can start really
putting together the entire
design. So this thing here, I

117
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:25,500
show this again at the end of
the presentation with one of our
techniques. This is four layers

118
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:30,542
of a speech assist board I
designed that is a great
reference, because I know

119
00:12:30,542 --> 00:12:36,125
exactly what it's supposed to
look like. If you also know the
components, almost all of this

120
00:12:36,125 --> 00:12:40,042
stuff except maybe some of the
nondestructive methods assume
there's no components on the

121
00:12:40,042 --> 00:12:45,958
board. If you go through the
process, you make a note of the
components and take them off the

122
00:12:45,958 --> 00:12:50,042
board to actually start
destructively getting down to
the different layers. If you

123
00:12:50,042 --> 00:12:56,500
don't know, then you can re‑
create a whole schematic. It's
like an electronic road map, and

124
00:12:56,500 --> 00:13:02,500
then you totally win. All right.
So the first set of things we
look at is solder mass removal.

125
00:13:05,708 --> 00:13:11,125
This is getting access to the
top and bottom layers, because
those are the only two protected

126
00:13:11,125 --> 00:13:16,708
by the solder mask. Lots of
different layers. You'll see the
mechanical layer that the manual

127
00:13:16,708 --> 00:13:21,167
abrasion and mechanical. We go
through these and see. It's
surprising a lot of stuff you

128
00:13:21,167 --> 00:13:26,417
see the lowest tech ends up
being actually most useful,
which is great for us, because

129
00:13:26,417 --> 00:13:32,417
it's also the cheapest. So what
I'll do is run through a bunch
of these techniques. On the fast

130
00:13:34,667 --> 00:13:40,833
track work, a bunch of stuff
didn't work. I don't have the
times to go through all the

131
00:13:40,833 --> 00:13:45,167
stuff that didn't, so I have one
slide for each section that
didn't. You don't have to fail

132
00:13:45,167 --> 00:13:51,250
the way I did. I tried lots of
stuff. They're will on my
website as of today, so if you

133
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:57,250
go to grandideasstudios.com. I
have an academic paper published
next week or something, so that

134
00:14:05,625 --> 00:14:13,333
will be what I'm saying here
except written down in like
really nice sentences. That took

135
00:14:13,333 --> 00:14:19,333
a really like time to write.
Sandpaper, everyone has
sandpaper. It seems like an

136
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:27,500
obvious sort of solution, and it
is. It works great. So this is
something, URN, for this

137
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:39,458
particular section, and just
sanded it. It worked great. The
one thing to worry about,

138
00:14:39,458 --> 00:14:44,958
though, is you have to make sure
the sandpaper is plain art to
the surface. You want to make

139
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:50,625
sure you evenly sand, because if
you don't you get wear and sand
down into the substrate and into

140
00:14:50,625 --> 00:14:56,625
the copper and the substrate.
I'll show you that when we do
the delayering stuff. It's using

141
00:14:56,625 --> 00:15:03,083
sandpaper. You can put boards of
the same height of the board
you're sanding to keep things

142
00:15:03,083 --> 00:15:09,083
really level. The effective
lowest cost way to do it.
There's just some results of

143
00:15:13,708 --> 00:15:19,708
that. Different grits. Depending
on the finish, some circuit
boards have gold surface finish

144
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:28,000
on the pad. Some have a solder
over bare copper where it's like
solder kind of leveled or blown

145
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:35,167
over the pads. So depending on
the surface finish required for
the board, you might need a

146
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:40,792
different grit sandpaper. So the
thicker the surface finish, you
may need a stronger sandpaper

147
00:15:40,792 --> 00:15:46,792
first, and you move up to higher
grit to remove the solder mask.
You see on the iPhone board, 400

148
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:53,458
grit sandpaper, you can wear off
that solder mask, but you don't
wear down the copper at all.

149
00:15:53,458 --> 00:15:59,458
Using a fiberglass scratch
brush, which I hadn't known
anything about before but I

150
00:16:01,833 --> 00:16:08,292
guess they use them for scraping
off rust on metal that you're
working with or cleaning off

151
00:16:08,292 --> 00:16:13,208
different types of parts,
they're great for removing
solder mass. It's better for

152
00:16:13,208 --> 00:16:19,625
selective areas. So say you want
to access a single trace on the
board, that's what the

153
00:16:19,625 --> 00:16:25,833
fiberglass brush is great for
it. You can do a whole board,
but it will take a little while.

154
00:16:25,833 --> 00:16:30,458
Make sure you wear gloves
because it will flake off and
you have tons of splinters all

155
00:16:30,458 --> 00:16:37,625
over your hands and finger and
everything. I posted a picture
of some of those at some point.

156
00:16:37,625 --> 00:16:43,625
One person realized fiberglass
shards are really bad. I'm like,
I know. Thanks for that tip. So

157
00:16:49,583 --> 00:16:57,333
that's a scratch brush.
Sandblasting, you don't normally
associate sandblasting with

158
00:16:57,333 --> 00:17:03,208
circuit boards. I don't. You
sort of associate it with like
building motorcycles or

159
00:17:03,208 --> 00:17:08,542
something like that. Using it
with big pieces of metal. But it
actually works pretty well to

160
00:17:08,542 --> 00:17:14,625
scrape off solder mass coatings.
So I went to a place called
TechShop, which is a fitness

161
00:17:14,625 --> 00:17:21,250
center for nerds or something.
You try to use the machines, but
there's a really, really cool

162
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:26,333
idea. There's places all over
the country. Different
organizations do the same thing.

163
00:17:26,333 --> 00:17:33,375
I went over there and say, hey,
I'm working on a project. Can I
use your machine. I'm not a

164
00:17:33,375 --> 00:17:39,667
member. I don't want to sign up
for a month to use your machine
for an hour. Can I come in and

165
00:17:39,667 --> 00:17:44,292
stood around for a long time,
and they're like, okay, come in.
I gave the guy 20 bucks so he

166
00:17:44,292 --> 00:17:50,208
can go on his lunch break to do
this stuff for me. It's amazing
what you get when you ask nicely

167
00:17:50,208 --> 00:17:56,208
and hold money up. So this one,
we had to be really careful
because sandblasting is normally

168
00:17:58,875 --> 00:18:06,292
a very PSI, high rate of speed
type of application, so the
operator tried to kind of scale

169
00:18:06,292 --> 00:18:09,458
it back a little bit and be a
little gentle on the board. We
had some pretty massive

170
00:18:09,458 --> 00:18:16,500
failures, but once you got the
technique right, you use the
standard type of sandblasting

171
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:22,500
machine. We were at a 60 grit
aluminous oxide 80 PSI, and
that's the standard. He had the

172
00:18:27,542 --> 00:18:33,583
best success 6 to 8 inches away
shooting at an angle. This works
really well with standard types

173
00:18:33,583 --> 00:18:38,708
of boards. We put an iPhone in
it, and it got destroyed to
shreds. It was way too fragile.

174
00:18:38,708 --> 00:18:45,583
The standard types of boards,
even two‑layer boards with a
thick substrate seem to work

175
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:51,292
best. We got noticeable pitting
in the copper, so technically,
so there's no damage in the

176
00:18:51,292 --> 00:18:58,208
copper. For our purposes it
stent matter as long as we get a
good image of the layer, we can

177
00:18:58,208 --> 00:19:04,208
do post‑ processing and clean it
up. They do also make things
that are called micro abrasive

178
00:19:04,208 --> 00:19:12,125
blasting capsules, which are
much smaller for fine detail on
jewelry and things, and that

179
00:19:12,125 --> 00:19:18,125
probably would have been a
better solution. I didn't know
where to get one of those. This

180
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:27,000
is fun. This is my favorite
part. Making a mess. Oh, wait.
Wrong conference. I mean,

181
00:19:29,958 --> 00:19:34,917
removing solder mask. So these
chemicals, there's lots of
different chemicals out there,

182
00:19:34,917 --> 00:19:40,500
and if you search the Internet,
you have to use the sodium
ethanol meth late to dip it in

183
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:47,167
the thing and hold it under the
heat lamp and the bunson burner.
They say all this stuff, but I

184
00:19:47,167 --> 00:19:52,458
don't think people actually ever
test the stuff except people
that plow their fingers off. I

185
00:19:52,458 --> 00:19:58,083
was a little wary of stuff I
read on the Internet, and I
think I'm using chemicals

186
00:19:58,083 --> 00:20:02,750
designed for this type of thing.
Luckily, there were chemicals
that exist. There's two

187
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:08,875
chemicals I looked at that were
actually used by circuit board
fabricators if they mess up the

188
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:14,875
application of solder mass,
there's a chemical to strip the
solder mass off and they can

189
00:20:17,875 --> 00:20:23,875
redo the process. It sort of
makes sense. I don't think I
have to say how dangerous this

190
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:38,333
stuff is, but it was really
dangerous. I don't have a fume
hood or anything, like proper

191
00:20:38,333 --> 00:20:45,167
OSHA compliance or anything.
This was in my backyard. I went
to Home Depot, and then I went

192
00:20:45,167 --> 00:20:52,667
on a shopping spree, to the Home
Depot for supplies an electronic
surplus stores for plies. I got

193
00:20:52,667 --> 00:20:58,667
a shopping free to buy all the
stuff. I have a chemical mat, a
mask, respirators, hot plates.

194
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:14,208
It's not a stir plate. Kind of a
magnet to stick it around or
something. This was a hot plate

195
00:21:14,208 --> 00:21:21,000
I got on eBay, and then the
chemicals and rocks to hold the
thing down. This was in my

196
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:28,500
backyard, and this particular
house that I lived in was
diagonal to a hotel. With all of

197
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:35,208
the doors of the rooms facing
down into my backyard, which I'm
sure they loved it when I was in

198
00:21:35,208 --> 00:21:40,542
the hot tub, but this I think
freaked them out a little bit
because people are like, I'm

199
00:21:40,542 --> 00:21:45,000
having a nice vacation in San 
Francisco. They look out and
say, what is this guy doing

200
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:51,000
dressed in a crazy suit? Oh,
yeah, which is  ‑ ‑ yeah. There
are actually was a black car

201
00:21:58,167 --> 00:22:03,167
outside of my house for two days
when I was doing this work. I
shit you not. Who cares. If

202
00:22:03,167 --> 00:22:09,792
Spartanburg sees all the stuff,
I'm doing work for the
government. I have a piece of

203
00:22:09,792 --> 00:22:15,208
paper that says it. They
approved it. I'm allowed to do
it. Nothing happened with it. So

204
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:20,083
I wore the suit, and it was
funny because with these
chemicals you have to heat them

205
00:22:20,083 --> 00:22:24,417
up to a certain temperature
because that helps with chemical
reactions and all this crazy

206
00:22:24,417 --> 00:22:30,417
mask stuff. So I had this full
chemical suit on. Who took the
picture? It wasn't me. Yeah. So

207
00:22:33,875 --> 00:22:40,000
my wife took the picture. Yeah.
You remember her when she was
pregnant and called my phone in

208
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:47,417
front of 8,000 people or
something in DEF CON a few years
ago. Yeah, she took the picture,

209
00:22:47,417 --> 00:22:52,208
and half the stuff was like
heating up on the hot plate. She
got really pissed because

210
00:22:52,208 --> 00:22:58,375
apparently it smells bad, but I
didn't know that because I'm
wearing a respirator. She took

211
00:22:58,375 --> 00:23:05,083
the picture and said why are you
wearing the stuff and I'm not
wearing it? She got super  ‑ ‑ I

212
00:23:05,083 --> 00:23:12,292
would swear if  ‑ ‑ I'm not
going to swear, because I'm a
nice person. But she was really

213
00:23:12,292 --> 00:23:20,208
angry and kind of going off like
a trucker. So she ran out and
shut the door and stuff so the

214
00:23:20,208 --> 00:23:26,375
smell wouldn't come in the
house. The fumes actually went
into the house. Next time if I

215
00:23:26,375 --> 00:23:32,375
do this I'll do it further away
from the house or just buy her a
respirator. So yeah, this is  ‑

216
00:23:34,875 --> 00:23:39,333
‑ that was fun. I was really
freaked out. I don't normally
deal with chemicals that much

217
00:23:39,333 --> 00:23:41,792
when I etched circuit boards.
Someone else etched the circuit
boards, but did you dump the

218
00:23:41,792 --> 00:23:47,792
chemicals down the drain? ( 
Inaudible response  ) >> Yeah,
chemicals, I don't know. They're

219
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:02,542
very effective, as you see, but
also just really freaky. So it
turns out both of these

220
00:24:02,542 --> 00:24:09,333
chemicals I used. One is a U.S.
company, and neither of them
attack the actual substrate,

221
00:24:09,333 --> 00:24:15,208
which is good for solder mask
removal but not if you trying to
delaminate the board. When you

222
00:24:15,208 --> 00:24:21,208
put the circuit board into the
heated chemical, it just starts
flaking off, which is really

223
00:24:30,583 --> 00:24:34,625
neat. The time depends on the
temperature and the thickness of
the solder mask and things like

224
00:24:34,625 --> 00:24:41,292
that, but the result is super
awesome. Full copper exposed and
no abrasion or anything like

225
00:24:41,292 --> 00:24:47,292
that. Really, really well‑ done.
Then lasers. Lasers. Who here
has a laser? Yeah. A lot of

226
00:24:53,458 --> 00:24:59,583
people, right? They're not
uncommon anymore like a laser
cut other something in the

227
00:24:59,583 --> 00:25:05,750
hacker space. The one I use is a
gigantic one, but it's no
different than - I don't think

228
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:09,833
it's much different than the
ones you have in hacker spaces
where you're doing laser

229
00:25:09,833 --> 00:25:16,042
engraving on your iPhones or
something. So this one I went to
a company in Milpitas. I wanted

230
00:25:16,042 --> 00:25:22,042
to use the laser and shoot it at
circuit boards is see what
happens. They said that's weird

231
00:25:26,375 --> 00:25:32,375
but sure. I went by. Places are
willing to do interesting
things, because for them I was

232
00:25:34,417 --> 00:25:38,292
talking to the operator, this is
totally fun because we have no
idea what's going to happen, and

233
00:25:38,292 --> 00:25:44,333
it's way better than like  ‑ ‑
way better than what we do day
in and day out. For them it was

234
00:25:44,333 --> 00:25:49,875
something fun. It happened
almost every place I went. It
was kind of fun for the

235
00:25:49,875 --> 00:25:54,208
operators because they didn't
know what to expect. In this
case, who knows. I was worried

236
00:25:54,208 --> 00:26:00,208
we would set the place on fire
or something. (  Inaudible
comment  ) >> All these guys are

237
00:26:04,875 --> 00:26:10,875
wearing. I guess this is like a 
‑ ‑ this is like a Defcon
tradition. Thank you, guys. I

238
00:26:13,625 --> 00:26:19,250
love you so much for that. Thank
you. I actually told them before
the talk, nothing is going to

239
00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:26,000
throw me off, not even a giant
dong. You said you weren't
coming on stage. You broke the

240
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:32,000
rule. Take your mustache down.
Okay. Where were we? Come on.
Take that out of here. Okay. So

241
00:26:36,708 --> 00:26:42,708
the lasers are for cutting
material like flex circuit
boards, the cover layer is for

242
00:26:48,292 --> 00:26:55,000
doing, say, like stencils or
solder stencils for circuit
board. We were just trying to

243
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:01,458
see, like, could we shine the
laser, and would it get through
solder mask. I went to use them

244
00:27:01,458 --> 00:27:07,458
to see if we can get to inner
layers, which I'll explain later
on. That doesn't really work.

245
00:27:10,292 --> 00:27:15,250
But in this case it did. Like we
just had a single pass of the
laser at medium power. I don't

246
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:20,875
know what that means, because he
told me there was low, medium
and high. Let's just start with

247
00:27:20,875 --> 00:27:26,875
medium and see what happens. So
we did one at medium power, and
it worked. The more you do it at

248
00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:35,125
medium power or if you had high
power, the more energy you're
shining at the board, eventually

249
00:27:35,125 --> 00:27:40,042
you destroy the board. In our
case if the single pass is fine,
we remove the substrate and very

250
00:27:40,042 --> 00:27:46,042
little damage to the copper or
to the substrate underneath. The
one on the left is from my test

251
00:27:48,208 --> 00:27:53,000
board and one is from annual
iPhone board. This is
interesting, because this

252
00:27:53,000 --> 00:28:00,583
connector that we've exposed is
traditionally under solder mask.
If I look at a board and see

253
00:28:00,583 --> 00:28:06,042
something like that, a connector
under solder mask, I would say,
okay, that's probably like a

254
00:28:06,042 --> 00:28:10,125
programming interface or some
connector used during
development or some test points

255
00:28:10,125 --> 00:28:16,042
the engineer wanted during
development. They cover over
with solder mask after. We use

256
00:28:16,042 --> 00:28:23,125
that as a clue for it. Let's get
access to that. It took about 30
minutes to set up the machine. I

257
00:28:23,125 --> 00:28:31,083
don't know. We were waiting 30
seconds or a minute to do the
passes to expose the solder

258
00:28:31,083 --> 00:28:37,083
mask. If you wanted to do a full
board for that, it will take a
while to do that. Manual methods

259
00:28:39,583 --> 00:28:44,833
seem to work better than the
high tech ones. I tried to use a
knife to run the solder mask

260
00:28:44,833 --> 00:28:50,833
away. There's mechanical
abrasion type of things, and
other chemicals not from the

261
00:28:54,917 --> 00:29:00,917
Internet but things that I
talked to people about.
Different types of heat. Because

262
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:07,917
on the Internet someone is like,
if you use a heat gun and heat
the solder mask, it's going to

263
00:29:07,917 --> 00:29:13,750
melt. The thing with solder mask
is if it's properly designed,
it's meant to withstand a lot of

264
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:19,750
heat. So it did its job. So
these are sort of some of the
failures. So the next set is

265
00:29:25,542 --> 00:29:29,792
delayering. This is where things
get more interesting, because we
look at the inner layers itself.

266
00:29:29,792 --> 00:29:37,458
So kind of a manual method and
we have different mechanical
stuff. This is where I started

267
00:29:37,458 --> 00:29:44,708
to learn a lot about the process
as you'll see. So, again,
sandpaper is very effective,

268
00:29:44,708 --> 00:29:51,708
low‑ cost method. I just took
the board, double‑ side taped it
to the work surface. As opposed

269
00:29:51,708 --> 00:29:57,542
to the solder mask, which if you
use sandpaper it comes off fast
in a few minutes maybe. When you

270
00:29:57,542 --> 00:30:03,542
delayer an entire layer of
substrate that could possibly be
40, 50, 60 thousandths thick, it

271
00:30:06,208 --> 00:30:12,208
will take a toll. I don't care
how strong you are. It's going
to hurt. Going to get sweaty. I

272
00:30:16,042 --> 00:30:22,833
know a lot of people don't like.
Instead of just using handheld
sandpaper, you could use a

273
00:30:22,833 --> 00:30:28,833
sanding tool. On the left I have
a sands stone, which is a 60 or
80‑ grit stone with a better

274
00:30:31,542 --> 00:30:39,000
grip on it. I have a Norton
sheet Sander tool, which you
attach it to this thing and go

275
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:45,000
back and forth. It takes a
while. Here's a little video of
it. Time lapse, of course. So

276
00:30:49,167 --> 00:30:56,208
I'm taking the stone and trying
to get the top copper layer off.
We'll have the substrate, and

277
00:30:56,208 --> 00:31:01,250
then I have to work on the next
layer. So first the sanding
stone, try to use that and sort

278
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:06,333
of works. We have the sheet
Sander tool and little by little
it comes off. With the solder

279
00:31:06,333 --> 00:31:11,083
mask removal you have to be
careful with the edges of the
board. If you don't sand

280
00:31:11,083 --> 00:31:17,083
straight back and forth you have
the wear along the edges. I show
the result. It looked like it

281
00:31:17,083 --> 00:31:23,958
happened really fast. That was
20 minutes and I was drenched at
the end. Here's the result. We

282
00:31:23,958 --> 00:31:28,042
had a little bit of scratching
of the inner layer and a little
bit of wear around the edge, but

283
00:31:28,042 --> 00:31:34,042
we have basically the second
layer of that four‑ layer board.
So pretty cool, I think. So I

284
00:31:37,333 --> 00:31:43,667
had the second layer exposed and
I was like all right we have the
three layers. I'm not that good

285
00:31:43,667 --> 00:31:49,667
with mechanical things like
tools or anything like that that
has moving parts, so I had a lot

286
00:31:51,958 --> 00:31:55,917
of failures with the Dremel
tools. I damaged a lot of stuff
along the way. This flap wheel,

287
00:31:55,917 --> 00:31:58,875
120‑ grit flat wheel worked
well. You get through that
substrate a lot faster than

288
00:31:58,875 --> 00:32:02,417
manually using a sheet sanding
tool. I don't have a video of
it, because you know what it

289
00:32:02,417 --> 00:32:06,333
looks like when it works. Here's
the result. This is layer three.
I heard someone laughing.

290
00:32:06,333 --> 00:32:09,167
There's something wrong with
this picture, isn't there?
There's a whole corner much

291
00:32:09,167 --> 00:32:15,167
circuit board missing. I
mentioned that. I'm not very
good with this. We works this,

292
00:32:19,125 --> 00:32:25,125
but it works fine. It's really
hard to control the Dremel tool.
When I did that, I was like wait

293
00:32:42,875 --> 00:32:48,875
a second. I do this mechanical
abrasion, and you'll use this
machine to automate the process.

294
00:32:53,833 --> 00:33:01,125
That took me nine minutes, by
the way, with the Dremel tool. I
had a CMC Miling in my office

295
00:33:01,125 --> 00:33:07,125
next door to make circuit boards
because circuit boards are
awesome and you need to make

296
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:17,333
them all the time, I think. This
is a T-Tech quick circuit 5000
and it's basically just a really

297
00:33:17,333 --> 00:33:24,000
accurate CMC. Did I use a
special one designed for
specifically cutting fiberglass

298
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:30,000
types of material. So there's a
setup. I have my computer
running the whole show and the

299
00:33:33,667 --> 00:33:39,667
milling machine myself. Fist I
started with the known reference
board, the six‑ layer board

300
00:33:42,458 --> 00:33:48,458
because I knew how much I could
increment each layer before I
would get access to the next

301
00:33:48,458 --> 00:33:53,667
layer. I knew the thickness, so
I used the machine to kind of
route it manually control the

302
00:33:53,667 --> 00:33:59,750
machine and adjusted the access
for the depth to come down and
kind of move the milling machine

303
00:33:59,750 --> 00:34:05,333
back and forth. With this
particular board you can't see
the left image at all or the

304
00:34:05,333 --> 00:34:11,333
right one, really. But the left
one has a bunch of numbers for
the different layers, so layers

305
00:34:21,375 --> 00:34:24,750
1 through VI all numbered. I
went and exposed the numbers so
I could prove I can access

306
00:34:24,750 --> 00:34:28,333
layers 1 through 6. That was no
problem. That was sort of, you
know, a board with very thick

307
00:34:28,333 --> 00:34:31,917
inner layer spacings, so it's
sort of like cheating. I did it
with the iPhone, and I tint want

308
00:34:31,917 --> 00:34:35,667
to manually control it, because
I wanted a precise outline I was
working in. So I created that

309
00:34:35,667 --> 00:34:41,667
inside the tool and adjusted the
z access in 1 mill increments. I
run the rub‑ out of this

310
00:34:41,667 --> 00:34:49,292
particular rectangle and adjust
it and keep running it again and
keep running it until you got  ‑

311
00:34:49,292 --> 00:34:55,292
‑ this is so funny. You're
dirty. So I keep doing the
operation until I could almost

312
00:34:59,083 --> 00:35:04,125
see the copper, and then I would
use a fiberglass scratch brush
to do that really fine removal

313
00:35:04,125 --> 00:35:10,625
of the substrate. There's a
little video. Just doing a
little bit. I don't know how

314
00:35:10,625 --> 00:35:16,667
long this will last, but it's
like taking off a super thin
layer of that substrate. I did

315
00:35:16,667 --> 00:35:22,000
that for a few hours until I got
it right. It actually worked, so
I could see inner layers of that

316
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:28,792
ten‑ layer iPhone board, which
is seriously complex. If you do
that across multiple sections,

317
00:35:28,792 --> 00:35:32,875
you can reverse engineer the
entire board. If you can do it
on something this complicated

318
00:35:32,875 --> 00:35:38,875
with that technique, you can
pretty much do it on any board
authorized. So last one of

319
00:35:44,583 --> 00:35:49,625
delayering is surface grinding,
this is another one where I do
the Dremel tool and the surface

320
00:35:49,625 --> 00:35:55,625
grinders grind down surfaces to
create nice surfaces and to do
all sorts of crazy metal work.

321
00:36:00,250 --> 00:36:06,833
We have this rotating wheel on
our rotary table, and the table
moves around and the wheel stays

322
00:36:06,833 --> 00:36:12,458
where it is. It's just a very,
very cool thing, but gigantic.
So on the left is a typical

323
00:36:12,458 --> 00:36:17,292
surface grinding machine. I went
to a place in Oakland, and this
is like a straight‑ up metal

324
00:36:17,292 --> 00:36:23,458
shop. I don't think they deal
with computer people, tech
people very often. I called them

325
00:36:23,458 --> 00:36:27,917
and said I want to grind down
some circuit boards. They're
like, yeah, I don't know about

326
00:36:27,917 --> 00:36:32,500
that. I was begging. I heard
that surface grinding would be
awesome, and the one guy I know

327
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:37,542
in San  Francisco that had a
surface grinder didn't want to
do it. He's like, try these

328
00:36:37,542 --> 00:36:43,125
guys. Try General Grinding. It
was amazing. We did it like
after hours in 8:00 p.m. in the

329
00:36:43,125 --> 00:36:51,083
worth neighborhood in Oakland
where they escorted me to my car
after the work was done, which

330
00:36:51,083 --> 00:36:57,667
was awesome. I can't defend
myself. At least in that
neighborhood. So what we did is

331
00:36:57,667 --> 00:37:02,000
we had this metal block, and the
surface grinders have a magnetic
chuck. So you mount what you're

332
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,917
working with, and usually it's
metal. So it goes not this
magnetic chuck. You can work

333
00:37:05,917 --> 00:37:12,583
with it. The circuit board is
nonferrous, and we put it onto a
block and it would hold it in

334
00:37:12,583 --> 00:37:18,583
place. My machine had give or
take maybe half a million,  .1
mill. give or take, half a mill.

335
00:37:23,917 --> 00:37:29,458
A machine like that size is way
more accurate. Here's a process
with a little dressing of the

336
00:37:29,458 --> 00:37:35,458
wheel. It just comes down and
just grinds the board. It does
this whole process, and it takes

337
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:44,208
like a 45 second process or so,
and it doesn't look like it's
doing much, but it's shaving a

338
00:37:44,208 --> 00:37:50,167
really thin layer of the board.
You do it over and over again as
we got down, and what you can do

339
00:37:50,167 --> 00:37:54,792
is if you already know the
interlayer board thickness and
do a cross‑ section first and

340
00:37:54,792 --> 00:37:58,875
look at the side with a
magnifying glass, then you can
set it in the machine and you

341
00:37:58,875 --> 00:38:04,708
can automatically do it to that
point where you need it. What we
found is that the surface finish

342
00:38:04,708 --> 00:38:11,917
created by doing this was so
smooth you didn't have to get to
the layer itself. You could  ‑ ‑

343
00:38:11,917 --> 00:38:16,458
as long as you see it through
the substrate, it would polish
is so mush you can see the layer

344
00:38:16,458 --> 00:38:23,667
through it. This is pretty cool,
and a bunch of failures and heat
and laser doesn't work in this

345
00:38:23,667 --> 00:38:30,500
case for delayering because
laser energy affects materials
differently. So if you're trying

346
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:34,458
to cut through a layer of
substrate, that's going to work
differently than a lay of

347
00:38:34,458 --> 00:38:37,958
copper. If you don't know how
the substrate and copper they're
laid out on the board, you have

348
00:38:37,958 --> 00:38:43,958
a big mess. So for imaging here
we have x‑ray, 2D and 3D.
Everybody here probably had an

349
00:38:48,083 --> 00:38:53,625
x‑ray or knows somebody that
does. What you probably don't
know where to get access to an

350
00:38:53,625 --> 00:39:00,333
x‑ ray on your own. They're used
a lot for failure analysis of
circuit boards and of components

351
00:39:00,333 --> 00:39:06,333
on SISH circuit boards. GUK to a
contract manufacturer and say,
hey, can I use your x‑ ray

352
00:39:08,375 --> 00:39:15,375
machine? They'll say sure.
That's what I did. X‑ rays
shining through it, and then the

353
00:39:15,375 --> 00:39:19,667
object is absorbing radiation
and you'll be able to to see the
results. We only see a composite

354
00:39:19,667 --> 00:39:26,917
image, not individual layers in
this case. Here's what the
machine looks like. Here's a

355
00:39:26,917 --> 00:39:32,583
veriphone pin pad from a pin pad
division with the active circuit
board shield on top of the

356
00:39:32,583 --> 00:39:39,500
circuitry. The 2D x‑ ray isn't
that great because you don't
know which layer things are on.

357
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:46,250
We can use it to get a general
sense of what's going on. In
this case this active shield had

358
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:52,958
like four layers of basically a
maze of copper we had to figure
out how to defeat that to get

359
00:39:52,958 --> 00:39:57,667
access underneath. If you have a
simple board, you can adjust the
field of view and angle of the

360
00:39:57,667 --> 00:40:03,667
x‑ ray to trace it out. It gets
very hard. They're that four‑
layer board. So it's already for

361
00:40:05,958 --> 00:40:10,542
certain things, but this is a
real money shot right here, x‑
ray. This blew my mind. This is

362
00:40:10,542 --> 00:40:15,125
the best part of the whole
research. CAT scans where you go
in that machine and it spins

363
00:40:15,125 --> 00:40:21,125
around and you get slices of
your body parts or whatever, you
can do that with circuit boards,

364
00:40:23,125 --> 00:40:27,583
too. Just like there's
manufacturers that have the
normal x‑ray machine, a lot have

365
00:40:27,583 --> 00:40:33,875
the 3D x‑ ray machine. You
basically take a number of 2D
images at different angles

366
00:40:33,875 --> 00:40:39,250
around the object and
mathematically processing that
down into slices. Here's a VGA

367
00:40:39,250 --> 00:40:45,250
solder ball with a defect in it.
Normally these companies look at
small objects or small defects,

368
00:40:47,333 --> 00:40:53,042
so I went in and actually called
the company, which is
recommended by

369
00:40:53,042 --> 00:40:55,833
SonicManufacturing, the
manufacturing that does it's a
2D x‑ ray, and I called the CEO

370
00:40:55,833 --> 00:41:02,417
and it turns out he was in
Germany for a conference. So it
was like 5:00 p.m. my time and

371
00:41:02,417 --> 00:41:08,250
3:00 a.m. his time or something
like that. As soon as I heard
the ring tone change from the

372
00:41:08,250 --> 00:41:12,875
U.S. to the European, I was
like, oh, crap. He answered
phone at 3:00 in the morning. I

373
00:41:12,875 --> 00:41:17,750
woke him up, which is not a good
way to start a relationship. He
was just more than willing to

374
00:41:17,750 --> 00:41:24,042
help. He's like, sure, I get
back tomorrow. Let's set a date
and let's do it. I've never done

375
00:41:24,042 --> 00:41:29,708
it, and let's try it. It was
totally awesome and a big
surprise for everybody there. So

376
00:41:29,708 --> 00:41:35,333
we took 360 different images of
that board, that four‑layer
board, and then once we got

377
00:41:35,333 --> 00:41:40,333
ought all of that data we loaded
it into a manipulation program
for 3D manipulation and moved

378
00:41:40,333 --> 00:41:46,542
through each layer and we could
manually creates a bunch of
JPEGs so we could hit a key and

379
00:41:46,542 --> 00:41:54,375
look through each layer. I don't
remember the actual layer or
slice thickness, but it was

380
00:41:54,375 --> 00:42:00,458
totally amazing. The results
vary based on how many layers
you have, the inner layer of

381
00:42:00,458 --> 00:42:06,042
thickness and what other
materials are used because some
high end boards use very complex

382
00:42:06,042 --> 00:42:13,042
materials. Here's the result of
this CAT scan on our board. So
we're slowing going through each

383
00:42:13,042 --> 00:42:20,458
layer. Layer one is about to
come up. Let's see. There it is.
There's layer 1, and then layer

384
00:42:20,458 --> 00:42:25,583
2 comes up. There's layer 2. We
go through the middle of the
board, the middle substrate,

385
00:42:25,583 --> 00:42:30,917
which is thicker than the
others. Layer 3Coms up fast.
There's 3, and there's 4. So now

386
00:42:30,917 --> 00:42:35,958
nondestructively we can see
through the entire circuit board
without doing anything, which is

387
00:42:35,958 --> 00:42:41,958
awesome. Here's another view of
it. So you'll notice  ‑ ‑
thanks. It wasn't my machine,

388
00:42:47,250 --> 00:42:52,667
but thanks anyway. So you notice
the field of view is small, so
if you do it across a larger

389
00:42:52,667 --> 00:42:58,417
board, you have to do it
multiple times. It took half an
hour to get this done so totally

390
00:42:58,417 --> 00:43:04,417
awesome. We had failures doing
acoustic microscopy that didn't
work at all. In the paper

391
00:43:06,542 --> 00:43:10,375
released next week and in the
presentation, I broke this down
into a characterization.

392
00:43:10,375 --> 00:43:16,167
Depending on how much time and
money you have, likelihood of
success, how much you want to

393
00:43:16,167 --> 00:43:23,083
risk your life, you can look at
the techniques and figure out
which is good for which of your

394
00:43:23,083 --> 00:43:28,917
situations. I like the manual
methods because it's a quick and
dirty thing. The x‑ray was

395
00:43:28,917 --> 00:43:32,625
totally awesome, too. Next
steps. There are some other
methods that people told me

396
00:43:32,625 --> 00:43:38,083
about for delayering using the
key tones to actually strip the
inner layer adhesive, drum

397
00:43:38,083 --> 00:43:45,208
Sander which is like a surface
grinder. What I want to do and
started to work on is a tool to

398
00:43:45,208 --> 00:43:52,417
take all of the layer images I
have gotten through the various
techniques and start a process

399
00:43:52,417 --> 00:43:56,875
to kind of automatically or
assist in reverse engineering
those back into something

400
00:43:56,875 --> 00:44:02,208
meaningful. Take the layers and
do image processing and figure
out connections and possibly

401
00:44:02,208 --> 00:44:06,625
turn that into schematics. Maybe
by next year I have something to
show on that. It's a great

402
00:44:06,625 --> 00:44:11,292
opportunity for me because it's
a lot of software and I'm not
much of a software guy so I have

403
00:44:11,292 --> 00:44:17,292
to learn Python and stuff. It's
like D‑gate, which is a tool for
pattern recognition of silicone,

404
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:25,833
and then Ron par, which is major
malfunction tool does
recognition as well. Those are

405
00:44:25,833 --> 00:44:31,000
chip level. I want to do
something board level and super
cool. There's the link with all

406
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:38,500
the materials, but just go to my
website and find it. There we
go. The end. Thanks for coming.
