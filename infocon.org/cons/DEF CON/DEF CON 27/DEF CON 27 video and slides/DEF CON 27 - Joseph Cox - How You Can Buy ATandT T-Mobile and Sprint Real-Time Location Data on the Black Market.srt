00:00:00.000,00:00:05.005
>>Hey. So yeah. I’m Joseph Cox,
a journalist. I’ll elaborate on
uh my affiliations in a bit. But

00:00:08.275,00:00:15.015
I’m gonna be talking about how
you can buy AT and T, T-Mobile,
Sprint and in some cases,

00:00:15.015,00:00:20.020
Verizon data um on the black
market. So, one day I just wake
up and I get this rather ominous

00:00:23.924,00:00:28.862
message. And I’ve kind of put it
verbatim so there are some typos
and stuff but “there is a new

00:00:28.862,00:00:34.301
bail bond database company that
is geo tracking people. People
are reselling to the wrong

00:00:34.301,00:00:38.739
people. Call me.” And obviously
I’ve redacted the source’s um
phone number cause they’re an

00:00:38.739,00:00:45.245
anonymous source. Um we hear
about government surveillance,
geolo uh geo location tracking

00:00:45.245,00:00:50.951
or that sort of stuff all the
time. Here, this is a private
company selling a similar

00:00:50.951,00:00:56.089
capability to private
individuals. Uh a particular
focus of mine. And of course,

00:00:56.089,00:01:02.396
reselling to the wrong people, I
want to know um what this is.
This all says that in or around

00:01:02.396,00:01:07.334
the bounty hunting industry and
they’re clearly quite familiar
with how this technology works.

00:01:07.334,00:01:13.173
So we start talking. Uh they
only really wanna discuss it on
the phone. They say many

00:01:13.173,00:01:19.613
people’s uh rights are being
violated. As we strike up a
conversation, he’s using terms

00:01:19.613,00:01:24.651
like phone ping. Which are, some
of you may know, a sort of law
enforcement or industry power

00:01:24.651,00:01:31.191
lense for geolocation a phone.
Um the source even offers, if
you give me a phone number, uh,

00:01:31.191,00:01:37.597
he will be able to locate it.
That is a pretty wild claim. Uh
and I was obviously very

00:01:37.597,00:01:42.602
skeptical at first. But, hell,
why not? Um so I get a US phone
number of someone that I know

00:01:45.906,00:01:50.978
would give consent to be
tracked. Uh with their
permission, obviously. Uh but

00:01:50.978,00:01:56.183
then they say if you are paying
the 300 dollars. Now this is the
price that a phone ping is going

00:01:56.183,00:02:01.288
on the black market at the time.
We’ll go into other prices a
little bit later. Uh and I say

00:02:01.288,00:02:05.292
yeah. I give the phone number,
again I’ve redacted that, uh and
when do you think it will be

00:02:05.292,00:02:10.297
doable? Uh just before a kind
of, a carry on rant, we normally
don't pay sources for

00:02:13.100,00:02:16.903
information. Because if you
start paying someone they’re
gonna give you stuff kind of

00:02:16.903,00:02:22.175
irrespective of whether it’s
true or not, irrespective of
it’s uh veracity, so you don’t

00:02:22.175,00:02:26.513
wanna do that as a journalist.
You only wanna do stuff that’s
in the public interest. But here

00:02:26.513,00:02:33.120
we want to see, explore or prove
whether this is even possible.
You know I mean we could talk to

00:02:33.120,00:02:36.490
three, four, five people here
who says yes but we want to
actually see it and we want to

00:02:36.490,00:02:42.062
actually geo locate the phone.
Because if I can do that and I’m
not a bounty hunter, I’m not a

00:02:42.062,00:02:47.034
cop, uh I’m a journalist, that
shouldn’t be possible
theoretically. So that’s why we

00:02:47.034,00:02:52.105
um took that extra step. Uh and
he says yeah I’ll, I’ll figure
it out and get back to you.

00:02:52.105,00:02:58.779
Shortly after, I get sent a
Google Maps uh interface. This
isn’t the exact phone ping, uh

00:02:58.779,00:03:05.185
I’m gonna show you genuine, real
phone locations uh from bounty
hunting, bounty hunter services

00:03:05.185,00:03:10.190
later. This is um, similar to
the one we got. Uh it geolocated
to Queens, New York. Uh to where

00:03:12.459,00:03:17.130
the person was who agreed to be
tracked. Uh and as you can see
it’s something like five, six

00:03:17.130,00:03:22.135
blocks um diameter. Uh but it
was pretty accurate. So that’s
the main story we’re gonna focus

00:03:25.539,00:03:28.709
on and it will, it will develop
from there. But just to
elaborate a bit, I’m a

00:03:28.709,00:03:34.614
journalist from Motherboard.
Which is like the technology and
science section of VICE. I cover

00:03:34.614,00:03:40.387
the dish line diagrams, cyber
security, hacking uh and this
kind of um, you know, brings all

00:03:40.387,00:03:46.426
of those together. And right up
top if you have more information
about location data, that’s my

00:03:46.426,00:03:52.833
signal number and I will put it
uh at the end as well. So just a
layout of sort of what I’m gonna

00:03:52.833,00:03:56.736
be talking about. Obviously
first it’s gonna be how my
source actually managed to get

00:03:56.736,00:04:02.209
that data and how he managed to
track a phone um to Queens, New
York. The supply chain of that

00:04:02.209,00:04:07.214
location data is not as simple
as me just going to T-Mobile,
buying the data and then getting

00:04:07.214,00:04:13.487
it there. There are various
organizations, companies in sort
of a trickle down effect um of

00:04:13.487,00:04:18.925
how this industry actually
works. And then I’m going to
show that it’s, it wasn’t just

00:04:18.925,00:04:24.598
one off for us. Like we didn't
get lucky and like oh this is
one instance of abuse, it is uh

00:04:24.598,00:04:29.269
an endemic problem. Uh and
leaked documents that we got
from one company specifically

00:04:29.269,00:04:35.308
marketing uh to bounty hunters
to geolocate phones kinda shows
the like wider breadth of this

00:04:35.308,00:04:41.948
um issue. But then there’s like
a short part at the end which
shows how you can still do it

00:04:41.948,00:04:48.722
today with a different method
including for Verizon data um as
well. And it is worryingly

00:04:48.722,00:04:55.262
simple to actually get a hold of
that data. So what actually is
the information that’s being

00:04:55.262,00:04:59.733
sold? I mean, as the vast
majority of you will know, your
cell phones are constantly

00:04:59.733,00:05:05.405
phoning home uh to cell phone
towers nearby so T-Mobile or
whoever can say, hey this is

00:05:05.405,00:05:09.843
where to root the text messages
or where to root um the phone
calls. And the byproduct of that

00:05:09.843,00:05:15.015
has caused the general physical
location depending on, you know,
how close you are to the cell

00:05:15.015,00:05:20.420
towers and that sort of thing.
In the one we got, it was a few
blocks. Um in these ones, these

00:05:20.420,00:05:25.125
are real phone pings from bounty
hunter services. The one on the
left is quite broad. Like that's

00:05:25.125,00:05:29.963
not super helpful. The one on
the right is, I mean that’s more
than five or six blocks right?

00:05:29.963,00:05:34.267
That is a section of a city. Uh
but if you’re a bounty hunter,
or if you're trying to stalk

00:05:34.267,00:05:38.838
someone, uh or anything really,
that can still be useful
information. So it really,

00:05:38.838,00:05:45.111
really does vary. The quality of
the data. But it is not just
cell phone tower data. There’s

00:05:45.111,00:05:51.985
also assisted GPS or A-GPS data.
Of course this runs from the GPS
chip in your phone. And it’s

00:05:51.985,00:05:58.058
typically reserved for um
emergency responders. Or 911,
where they need to locate you uh

00:05:58.058,00:06:04.064
for whatever reason. It, it, if
there’s an incident this is much
more precise. It’s not really

00:06:04.064,00:06:10.337
blocks it’s more double digit
figures, you know, under 20
meters sometimes. Uh and

00:06:10.337,00:06:14.507
sometimes it can show where
someone is inside a building.
Again, this is a real phone

00:06:14.507,00:06:18.211
ping. It doesn’t show where they
are in the building. They could
be in the backyard, or in the

00:06:18.211,00:06:24.217
living room or whatever. But
they’re clearly in that
building. And um, I did blur the

00:06:24.217,00:06:28.288
outer edge of it because I’m
actually not sure if this is a
fugitive or if it’s someone

00:06:28.288,00:06:33.727
who’s the victim of stalking or
abuse. Uh and that’s actually
sort of an issue of reporting

00:06:33.727,00:06:38.498
this cause you can’t always tell
unless you manage to actually
talk to a um a victim, which is

00:06:38.498,00:06:45.038
uh difficult. So how the hell
did um did the person actually
manage to locate that phone in

00:06:45.038,00:06:51.244
Queens, New York? Which is of
course the first question I, I
kind of wanted to answer. I’m

00:06:51.244,00:06:55.515
gonna give like a skeleton or a
template of how it works in
general but then drill down to

00:06:55.515,00:07:02.055
the um specifics. So obviously
it starts with the carriers, AT
and T, T-Mobile, whoever. Who,

00:07:02.055,00:07:06.626
they have this data anyway. They
give it to law enforcement if
they need it, or if they do an

00:07:06.626,00:07:11.598
overbroad warrant or whatever.
Um but one day the carriers
decided that we can also sell

00:07:11.598,00:07:17.404
this data uh for various
purposes. They then, rather than
just selling it straight to

00:07:17.404,00:07:21.808
people uh, which would be
logistically difficult, there
would be a lot of infrastructure

00:07:21.808,00:07:26.780
involved, they’d have to, you
know, set up their own customer
support or whatever, they sell

00:07:26.780,00:07:31.518
um access to that data to
location aggregators. And I
should just say it’s not like

00:07:31.518,00:07:35.889
there’s a sequel dump that’s
being sold from T-Mobile to
location aggregators then

00:07:35.889,00:07:40.794
someone else. It’s more like
they’re selling the capability
to look up that data via an API

00:07:40.794,00:07:46.066
or whatever it may be. Um and
then when you want the data
you’ll look it up, it’s not like

00:07:46.066,00:07:51.671
um a single dump of information.
But location aggregators, yeah,
they act as this bottleneck. And

00:07:51.671,00:07:56.676
there’s, there were three I
think there’s two now, and they
purely focus on location data.

00:07:56.676,00:08:02.315
So they may say we wanna prevent
fraud with banks, uh we, we’ll
be able to check the, hey if

00:08:02.315,00:08:08.154
this person is logging in from,
I don’t know, the Philippines or
something but their phone is

00:08:08.154,00:08:12.225
actually in the UK. There’s some
sort of weird discrepancy there
and maybe we can block the

00:08:12.225,00:08:18.098
transaction. And there’s lots of
use, uh uses for location data.
But what they do is, the

00:08:18.098,00:08:23.803
bottleneck then kind of, expands
out like an hourglass, and that
data access is sold to data

00:08:23.803,00:08:29.476
brokers. Now these guys don’t
focus just on location data,
they may do address lookups,

00:08:29.476,00:08:34.047
maybe phone subscriber
information. So you give it a
phone, maybe you’ll get the IMEI

00:08:34.047,00:08:38.385
and you know the name and
address of the person who’s
using it, uh sometimes license

00:08:38.385,00:08:43.723
plate information. And they will
cater to all sorts of um
industries. Who uh whoever it

00:08:43.723,00:08:47.727
may be. And then you have the
end user clients who are
actually, okay I’m gonna do this

00:08:47.727,00:08:52.198
look up and now I’m gonna find
the location of a um a T-Mobile
phone. And this is where a

00:08:52.198,00:08:57.971
bounty hunter’s gonna be or uh a
property salesman or a used car
salesman who also have had

00:08:57.971,00:09:03.510
access to um this sort of data.
So the phone we tracked, uh it
just happened to be on the

00:09:03.510,00:09:08.515
T-Mobile network. When I was
talking to my source uh they
said that you can basically do

00:09:08.515,00:09:14.120
any phone except Verizon. So,
yeah, we found a T-Mobile device
and sent that number over. And

00:09:14.120,00:09:17.891
then the way we figured this out
was obviously that source was
very knowledgeable about the uh

00:09:17.891,00:09:22.195
industry. I ended up speaking to
the location aggregators, to
other people who have used the

00:09:22.195,00:09:27.066
company, other people that have
used similar tools. And there’s
even PDF’s online that are just

00:09:27.066,00:09:31.871
sitting out there. This story
has kind of been out there in
the open um but it kind of

00:09:31.871,00:09:37.076
required the source proving it
could happen to kind of bring it
all together. T-Mobile sold the

00:09:37.076,00:09:42.115
access to Zumigo, which is one
of the two location aggregators.
Uh they’re the one that

00:09:42.115,00:09:47.887
primarily focuses on, you know,
we want to prevent fraud and
that sort of thing. But to give

00:09:47.887,00:09:53.026
an idea of sort of companies
that we’re dealing with, this is
a presentation that the FC,

00:09:53.026,00:09:57.897
sorry that Zumigo gave to the
FCC, the Federal Communications
Commission a few years ago. This

00:09:57.897,00:10:04.070
PDF was just online on the FCC
website. And you’ll see the top,
it says wi, they’re lobbying to

00:10:04.070,00:10:07.841
remove the consent requirement
of stating the information
that’s being released by the

00:10:07.841,00:10:13.980
carrier. When phone carriers
sell this information, they do
it under the prerequisite that

00:10:13.980,00:10:19.519
whoever is using it is going to
um seek consent. So you’ll push
a text message, you’ll push a

00:10:19.519,00:10:24.657
phone call saying , Hi you’re
about to be tracked by I don’t
know, uh AA Roadside Assistance,

00:10:24.657,00:10:30.730
something like that. Is that
okay? Uh you ex, hopefully
explicitly opt in uh and then

00:10:30.730,00:10:34.467
they can get your location.
Here, Zumigo is trying to get
rid of that so you’d have to opt

00:10:34.467,00:10:39.873
out of um having your location
tracked at any time by any of
the companies in the supply

00:10:39.873,00:10:44.978
chain. They weren’t successful
in that but it does give you an
indication of what sort of

00:10:44.978,00:10:49.983
companies um we’re dealing with
here. Then under that there’s a
date, a data broker called

00:10:52.852,00:10:57.824
microbilt. Um, and again as I
mentioned, the data brokers
don’t just sell location data.

00:10:57.824,00:11:01.494
These were doing address
lookups. They weren’t doing
license plate uh I seem to

00:11:01.494,00:11:06.065
remember but also sort of uh um
useful information you might
want if you’re tracking someone.

00:11:06.065,00:11:11.070
Um so after the source told me
about microbilt, I look around,
I go on their website, I find

00:11:13.072,00:11:18.077
this nice little PDF about a
project called Mobile Device
Verify. Um which sounds more

00:11:20.079,00:11:23.783
innocuous than it actually is
because then when you drill down
it’s like the geolocation lat

00:11:23.783,00:11:29.889
long coordinates of the phone,
the estimated location accuracy,
the proximity of the location um

00:11:29.889,00:11:34.827
to another one. That would be
comparing it to an address.
Something like that. Um and then

00:11:34.827,00:11:39.399
I did something else that we
don’t normally do. As well as
paying the source to locate the

00:11:39.399,00:11:46.205
phone I also made, to be honest,
a very crap undercover identity
pretending to be a bounty

00:11:46.205,00:11:52.078
hunter. Just made a new email
address and contacted microbilt
saying, hi I’m interested in

00:11:52.078,00:11:56.282
your mobile tracking product,
and I explicitly said I am a
bail bondsman and I want it for

00:11:56.282,00:12:01.054
this purpose. They handily
replied with a nice little price
list. And here you can see

00:12:01.054,00:12:07.193
there’s the location
verification. Which just be you
pay $4.95 uh if you’re looking

00:12:07.193,00:12:12.832
between one and 250 phones. I
think that’s per lookup uh but
I’d have to double check. But

00:12:12.832,00:12:18.271
then underneath there’s the
monitoring per device service.
So microbilt doesn’t do just

00:12:18.271,00:12:23.276
individual pings, but you could
pay to track a phone hourly, uh
daily, weekly um and potentially

00:12:26.379,00:12:33.019
more granular than that if you
just pay a little bit more
money. Uh I can’t think of many

00:12:33.019,00:12:37.490
legitimate uses of a private
company selling to private
individuals a constant

00:12:37.490,00:12:42.795
monitoring service. The
individual ping is almost
defensible. I don’t quite see uh

00:12:42.795,00:12:46.499
the legitimate use case for it
monitoring per device. And as
you see it’s like $12.95 there

00:12:46.499,00:12:51.504
so it’s like exceedingly cheap
to buy this data from these um
from these companies. And it’s

00:12:53.606,00:12:57.744
not just bounty hunters. So as I
said microbilt caters to all
these different industries but

00:12:57.744,00:13:02.682
specifically with the mobile
tracking product they’re doing
motor vehicle sea, uh sales,

00:13:02.682,00:13:08.421
which will be used car salesmen,
car dealerships that sort of
thing. Um maybe if they’re doing

00:13:08.421,00:13:12.792
a background check on someone
who’s buying a very expensive
car. Or I think uh definite use

00:13:12.792,00:13:17.430
case is if someone is behind on
their payments and they need to
repossess the vehicle, well

00:13:17.430,00:13:20.566
we’ll track their phone and then
we’ll find out where they are
and then we will get a repo man

00:13:20.566,00:13:26.205
to go get the um the car from
them. Uh and then they’re also
doing for property managers. Uh

00:13:26.205,00:13:31.911
you know just people, landlords
who are renting out um their
buildings. Um I’m not entirely

00:13:31.911,00:13:36.449
sure on how that data is
actually uh used by them but
microbilt were explicitly

00:13:36.449,00:13:41.020
advertising to that market and
it was explicitly the phone
tracking product as well as the

00:13:41.020,00:13:45.725
other ones as well. [speaker
sniffs] And then you get to the
bottom of the chain. Um and

00:13:45.725,00:13:50.730
allegedly the end user was Bail
Integrity Solutions. I say
allegedly because I don’t know.

00:13:52.932,00:13:57.904
They weren’t my source. It’s
only after our reporting
microbilt did an internal

00:13:57.904,00:14:04.177
investigation and they found
that the, the phone lookup was
allegedly from Bail Integrity

00:14:04.177,00:14:07.413
Solutions. There’s an ongoing
lawsuit there, you can go look
at the public court documents

00:14:07.413,00:14:13.453
and that’s who they name um as
the sort of bail bondsman or
bounty hunter firm that was um

00:14:13.453,00:14:18.891
getting access to this data.
Now, I’m not in that supply
chain and neither is my source,

00:14:18.891,00:14:23.796
obviously. So this is where sort
of the legitimate trade, quote
unquote legitimate trade, ends

00:14:23.796,00:14:30.403
and the black market begins. Um
Bail Integrity Solutions then
gave that phone ping to Google

00:14:30.403,00:14:37.376
Map interface, to my source, who
gave it to me. Uh or another way
to put it is that I,

00:14:37.376,00:14:41.314
Motherboard, gave the phone
number to my source, who gave
the phone number to Bail

00:14:41.314,00:14:46.319
Integrity Solutions, who then
triggered a lookup via the
microbilt API, which goes up

00:14:46.319,00:14:51.724
through Zumigo, to to, to
T-Mobile, grabs the current
location, brings it back down

00:14:51.724,00:14:58.030
and then it gets um sent to me.
Uh and just to stress, obviously
I’ve set this higher up but, I

00:14:58.030,00:15:03.369
should not have been able to get
this data. As sketchy as bounty
hunters getting it, it’s even

00:15:03.369,00:15:09.075
worse if I, a completely
unauthorized party was able to
buy and obtain and use this data

00:15:09.075,00:15:15.414
uh on the black market. [speaker
sniffs] So that was the one case
um that as I said is not an

00:15:15.414,00:15:22.021
isolated incident. So there’s a
website online, CerCareOne uh
dot com, I think. You can go

00:15:22.021,00:15:26.926
look it up now, it is still
there. When you visit, it looks
like a normal placeholder. Thank

00:15:26.926,00:15:30.496
you for visiting our site, it’s
under construction. okay
there’s, there’s nothing really

00:15:30.496,00:15:36.002
to look at here. But you go to a
specific section of the site and
it has a login portal. Um that

00:15:36.002,00:15:42.108
red bit is just my IP address um
that I uh redacted for, for just
making these screenshots. Uh,

00:15:42.108,00:15:48.648
and email address, password, you
log in. You’ll, you’ll notice
that there’s no registration

00:15:48.648,00:15:54.654
option. I’m not exactly sure how
people join this website. Invite
only, uh maybe apply some other

00:15:54.654,00:16:00.493
way um but you can’t just go and
sign up for this site which is
because this is a secret website

00:16:00.493,00:16:06.232
and secret company only for
serving bounty hunters. Um we
haven’t published these before

00:16:06.232,00:16:09.435
and I [speaking with laughter]
appreciate they are heavily
redacted. Uh but I did of course

00:16:09.435,00:16:14.907
wanna show you some stuff that
we haven’t been able to publish
before. So my source as well as

00:16:14.907,00:16:19.912
uh looking up the phone provided
me with a cache of documents,
various files from inside

00:16:22.114,00:16:27.453
CerCareOne. From what we can
determine, these screenshots
were taken with an administrator

00:16:27.453,00:16:32.458
account of CerCareOne. So you
log in with an admin account and
you can see a list of all of the

00:16:32.458,00:16:37.463
users uh who are on this
website. In all, it was around
250 bounty hunter companies

00:16:40.266,00:16:46.305
which had their own accounts on
this website. So that’s 250 bail
integrity solutions who may be

00:16:46.305,00:16:50.877
looking up for their own
purposes, for professional
reasons. Maybe their staff fancy

00:16:50.877,00:16:56.015
looking up their girlfriends
location which I have um been
told happens in this industry.

00:16:56.015,00:17:00.820
And it’s also 250 people who may
resell that access to people who
aren’t supposed to have it, like

00:17:00.820,00:17:07.126
me. Um and then it, it’s just
like a normal functioning,
pretty basic website. You have

00:17:07.126,00:17:09.962
numbers that you would click
that would show obviously the
phone numbers someone’s looked

00:17:09.962,00:17:15.468
up, um the activity which I
think actually may show the
phone pings, I’m not entirely

00:17:15.468,00:17:19.872
sure on that one. And then the
billing, you just top up your
account with maybe 1,000 dollars

00:17:19.872,00:17:24.877
and then we can start pinging
some phones. It’s really, really
that simple. So you go and you

00:17:24.877,00:17:29.782
click on the numbers and um
including the data there was
obviously a list of the phone

00:17:29.782,00:17:33.953
numbers that people have been
geolocating. Uh on the left
those are the numbers, I had to

00:17:33.953,00:17:38.891
redact them slightly. Then you
have the date and the time of
the lookup. To the right of that

00:17:38.891,00:17:44.497
you have the IP addresses, which
will become a bit more important
later. Uh whether it was found

00:17:44.497,00:17:48.968
or not. And the sort of data
that was obtained right at the
end, the cell phone tower data

00:17:48.968,00:17:53.973
or the A-GPS data that I
mentioned up top. I mean as you
can see, again it does vary

00:17:53.973,00:17:58.978
wildly. The top one um a
diameter of 582 meters. Right
down at the bottom to like three

00:18:01.180,00:18:07.186
and a half kilometers. So it’s
not super reliable but if you
are a bounty hunter just trying

00:18:07.186,00:18:12.158
to find if someone’s in, I don’t
know, Minnesota or then a
particular city or even like a

00:18:12.158,00:18:17.964
district of a city this is still
gonna be um pretty helpful. And
then you can see the A-GPS stuff

00:18:17.964,00:18:24.904
right down to, as I said, double
digit uh proximity or, or
accuracy. Just 13 meters uh you

00:18:24.904,00:18:31.877
might be able to find someone.
So I mentioned that this was a
secret website um of course I’m

00:18:31.877,00:18:35.147
not talking about any sort of
official classification, I just
means that in the terms and

00:18:35.147,00:18:40.052
conditions of the site that I
also got a copy of, um it says
that if you are using this

00:18:40.052,00:18:45.825
service you need to never reveal
the website or the companies
existence to anyone. Um

00:18:45.825,00:18:51.197
obviously someone broke that,
those terms of use. Uh thank you
for doing that. But it, it just

00:18:51.197,00:18:54.667
goes to show you what pains they
went to really, really keep this
under wraps. As well as the

00:18:54.667,00:18:58.637
hidden login portal uh and the
lack of registration and the
fact that they’re telling people

00:18:58.637,00:19:04.844
to keep it uh quiet. So I
mentioned the IP addresses. And
they tell you when you sign up,

00:19:04.844,00:19:10.316
give to us, CerCareOne, two IP’s
that we can whitelist. That way,
you know, we’ll minimize abuse

00:19:10.316,00:19:14.587
and we’ll be able to, you know,
keep on top of privacy uh and
all that sort of thing. And they

00:19:14.587,00:19:18.657
also tell you to be careful if
you’re using a password cause
obviously this is very sensitive

00:19:18.657,00:19:23.663
data. And you go through the
information. Again the phone
numbers, the dates and the IP’s.

00:19:27.066,00:19:32.071
There’s more than two IP’s
there. 64 dot, 71 dot, 131, 87.
Um clearly the two IP rule is

00:19:36.776,00:19:43.749
not really enforced at
CerCareOne. Uh leading one of my
sources um to stipulate. And

00:19:43.749,00:19:48.187
then some supporting evidence as
well, that this particular
administrator at CerCareOne was

00:19:48.187,00:19:54.393
potentially reselling their
access to the system on the
black market to other people who

00:19:54.393,00:19:58.564
would want it. Obviously we saw
IP’s from the US as you probably
would expect but there were

00:19:58.564,00:20:04.270
connections from Israel, uh for
Lithuania, various other places.
Now obviously some of those

00:20:04.270,00:20:09.742
could be VPN’s, VPS’s, whatever
but it still goes to show that
sort of lack, the lack of

00:20:09.742,00:20:14.747
security measures uh on this
website. And just indicative of
this sort of secondary market

00:20:16.916,00:20:20.820
that is going on underneath
this. And I didn’t mention this
earlier when I introduced the

00:20:20.820,00:20:25.691
website but when you use
CerCareOne, there is no text
message, there is no phone call,

00:20:25.691,00:20:30.930
there is no warning to the
target device uh being pushed.
So the target has no idea um

00:20:30.930,00:20:36.068
they’re being tracked. At all.
Uh and that was according to two
sources familiar um with how the

00:20:36.068,00:20:42.942
system works and who had used
it. And then it, some of it is
just a normal, you know, payment

00:20:42.942,00:20:45.845
website. People are signing up
with their personal gmail
addresses. This isn’t, you know,

00:20:45.845,00:20:51.050
at legit bail bonds dot com,
it’s just some blokes personal
gmail. Uh and you can top it up

00:20:51.050,00:20:56.055
with um a couple a grand of
credit and you can go and locate
some phones as well. So we have,

00:20:58.290,00:21:03.496
we’ve never shown this before,
this is uh a nearly full
screenshot of the CerCareOne um

00:21:03.496,00:21:08.300
system in action. This is what
you will see when you will log
in. You will look up a phone

00:21:08.300,00:21:13.806
number and then this is what it
will present you. Um so
obviously you, the, there will

00:21:13.806,00:21:18.878
be the phone number, the address
of what the ping is, the lat
long uh the type of data, in

00:21:18.878,00:21:24.817
this case A-GPS, the time. And
then the very nice pay per ping
balance at the bottom for 206 uh

00:21:24.817,00:21:29.822
226 dollars left. Um the name at
the top, Dan Grable uh I
believe, he was this

00:21:32.258,00:21:37.263
administrator of the um of the
site. Uh of three admins who ran
CerCareOne he runs a sort of um

00:21:41.100,00:21:46.138
they, they sell telephone
services to businesses and that
sort of thing and it appears

00:21:46.138,00:21:50.709
that he was one of the accounts
that may have been reselling
access because there are all of

00:21:50.709,00:21:56.215
these different IP’s connecting
through his um account. Uh he
hasn’t responded to request for

00:21:56.215,00:22:01.153
comment but if he wants to chat
I’m happy to. This, and, and,
and this particular ping has um

00:22:03.656,00:22:08.661
a sort of story behind it. So in
May 2017 two bounty hunters are
trying to track a fugitive from

00:22:12.898,00:22:19.805
Minnesota. They track him
somehow to this Nissan
dealership just off the highway

00:22:19.805,00:22:26.545
in Texas. The bounty hunters go
in. They lie to the dealership
and say hi we’re um US law

00:22:26.545,00:22:30.616
enforcement, we’re trying to
apprehend someone dangerous. Can
we wait here for the guy to turn

00:22:30.616,00:22:36.121
up? The dealership, not wanting
to you know, interfere with a
apparent law enforcement

00:22:36.121,00:22:42.861
investigation says yes, sure. Uh
the fugitive comes back. They
confront him, weapons drawn. Uh

00:22:42.861,00:22:48.300
all three men are armed. There’s
a brief scuffle. Uh the
fugitive’s gun falls out of his

00:22:48.300,00:22:53.906
belt onto a desk. Goes to grab
it and then in about six seconds
20 shots are fired from all

00:22:53.906,00:23:00.546
three guns at each other. Uh and
all three men die very soon
after that. Um a family uh of

00:23:00.546,00:23:04.950
young children or with young
children run away, people
scream, you can go watch the uh

00:23:04.950,00:23:09.955
the footage on YouTube. Um but
then, very strangely, just
shortly after um those killings

00:23:14.426,00:23:18.530
and the deaths, someone starts
using CerCareOne to look up the
location of their bounty

00:23:18.530,00:23:23.402
hunter’s phones. And that’s what
this ping is. I don’t think it’s
a coincidence that two bounty

00:23:23.402,00:23:29.241
hunters are out on a job and
someone starts tracking their
phones. And then just before

00:23:29.241,00:23:34.113
this lookup the same account,
according to the data, is used
to look up the location of a

00:23:34.113,00:23:39.218
phone from Minnesota. Which is
where the fugitive was on the
run from. We couldn’t determine,

00:23:39.218,00:23:45.257
you know, using various tools
like people dot come or various
ocentures, we couldn't determine

00:23:45.257,00:23:49.361
who that phone belonged to
because it looked like it didn’t
really have any registration

00:23:49.361,00:23:53.933
information. It seemed to be a
relatively new phone. And you
can maybe infer from that what

00:23:53.933,00:23:58.170
you will but we only publish
what we can know, right? So we,
we say we, we weren’t able to

00:23:58.170,00:24:03.375
identify that apart from it
being a Minnesota phone and it
was before um the shooting. Very

00:24:03.375,00:24:07.980
shortly before, multiple pings
uh before that. And it was also
located after the shootings as

00:24:07.980,00:24:14.787
well so that we can’t really
explain. Um and even if this is
not a case of um oh we’re

00:24:14.787,00:24:21.493
looking up the location
necessarily of a fugitive it is
still indicative of the sort of

00:24:21.493,00:24:27.833
people who are connected to this
market of phone location data.
That it’s two bounty hunters who

00:24:27.833,00:24:31.370
went in, they didn’t take their
body armor that was allegedly in
their vehicle, they lied about

00:24:31.370,00:24:34.707
being US law enforcement, they
then go on a shootout that
endangers a family of young

00:24:34.707,00:24:41.547
children, they die and they
killed someone as well. Um it
just shows the sort of people

00:24:41.547,00:24:46.552
that are connected to this um
this industry. So we had
microbilt, which was the one I

00:24:49.888,00:24:55.127
bought the ping from. And then
awhile before we had the
CerCareOne example I just gave.

00:24:55.127,00:24:57.129
Uh and then just before that and
kind of also overlapping with
CerCareOne, we had a service

00:24:57.129,00:24:59.131
called locate your cell dot com.
That’s still online, you can go
look it up. And it appears this

00:24:59.131,00:25:01.066
is one of the earliest examples
of um private individuals
selling the capability to look

00:25:01.066,00:25:05.738
up um phones. So this isn’t
marketed to bounty hunters or
roadside assistance, it’s

00:25:05.738,00:25:10.743
marketed to people who lost
their cell phone and they want
to find it. Or it’s marketed to

00:25:25.524,00:25:28.894
people who maybe their, their
kid went to the park and they
haven’t come back and they want

00:25:28.894,00:25:33.532
to check they’re okay. Or maybe
their senior relative of
dementia who’s a bit confused

00:25:33.532,00:25:40.205
and they, they didn’t gum, come
home or something like that. Um
the owner of this website who,

00:25:40.205,00:25:44.276
when you actually look into some
of the who is this, who, who his
history and various other

00:25:44.276,00:25:49.681
connecters is also uh linked to
CerCareOne. Uh a guy called um
Frank Rabito. He is quoted in

00:25:49.681,00:25:51.683
like some obscure local media
report from years and years ago
boasting about how he used his

00:25:51.683,00:25:56.688
company to help a woman find her
phone that she left in the
supermarket car park. Which is

00:26:02.761,00:26:07.766
clearly not a uh law enforcement
use, or really a legitimate use
of um data or capability that is

00:26:10.135,00:26:15.140
um this powerful. The, the
system isn’t online right now
but as I said you can go to the

00:26:15.140,00:26:19.645
website and you can, I think you
can even create an account I
believe. I tried to um be

00:26:19.645,00:26:25.017
contacts you use to lookup at
the moment because CerCareOne um
was shut down, it’s not exactly

00:26:25.017,00:26:30.389
clear how. And it appears this
shared the same access or at
least similar access. Um so this

00:26:30.389,00:26:35.394
is no longer in operation or
live just at the moment.
[speaker swigs drink] So you may

00:26:37.996,00:26:43.235
be wondering where Verizon is in
all of this. The microbilt
example where we pinged a phone

00:26:43.235,00:26:49.608
as I mentioned. It was only AT
and T, Sprint and T-Mobile. Um
and then from, from what I

00:26:49.608,00:26:54.613
understand, Verizon has taken a
much stronger stance against
this than the other tel co’s. Um

00:26:56.715,00:26:59.952
[speaker voice strain] one
bounty hunter told me, or sorry,
one bounty hunter and one other

00:26:59.952,00:27:05.891
source told me that Verizon has
enforced it so that consent text
or that consent call that’s

00:27:05.891,00:27:09.561
supposed to be pushed when you
locate a phone, they’re now
enforcing that at the carrier

00:27:09.561,00:27:14.766
level. So they’re not delegating
that responsibility to the
location aggregators or the data

00:27:14.766,00:27:18.804
brokers or the end users,
they’re like, we’ll handle it.
We will push the text out when

00:27:18.804,00:27:23.675
you make an API request and then
we will only release it um when
we get the confirmation of

00:27:23.675,00:27:27.813
consent. Which of course is a
good thing. But I wanna stress
something that has kind of been

00:27:27.813,00:27:32.818
lost in our coverage. Verizon is
not innocent in this at all. Um,
last year uh Senator Ron Wyden’s

00:27:36.922,00:27:41.059
office and the New York Times
did this sort of uh current
investigation to uh parallel an

00:27:41.059,00:27:45.797
investigation, I’m not entirely
sure but it was showing how all
of the major carriers were

00:27:45.797,00:27:51.436
selling the real time location
data access to a company called
Securus. Which would give it to

00:27:51.436,00:27:56.241
low level law enforcement like
prison guards and officials
without a warrant. They would

00:27:56.241,00:28:01.647
log in to a Securus portal,
upload a PDF of some sort of
document that kind of looked

00:28:01.647,00:28:06.785
legit and then they would just
let them um do the request and
pull the data. Um they could do

00:28:06.785,00:28:09.054
that without a warrant, they
could do that without a
subpoena, They could do that

00:28:09.054,00:28:14.259
without any sort of court order.
Um and Ron Wyden described it as
sort of a pinky promise of

00:28:14.259,00:28:18.196
ensuring this data was actually
being requested properly. So
there’s that Securus case as

00:28:18.196,00:28:25.103
well. But then we also found one
earlier, before that. And this
is kind of in between secure,

00:28:25.103,00:28:30.108
CerCareOne and Securus, they all
have these really similar names,
in between that. Um and as you

00:28:32.110,00:28:37.015
can see right there, there’s
Verizon. Instantly look up the
phone uh location of basically

00:28:37.015,00:28:43.255
any phone in the United States.
Uh again it’s cell phone tower
triangulation and it, uh GPS

00:28:43.255,00:28:47.225
data if available. You get a
nice little Google maps
interface and it’s only seven

00:28:47.225,00:28:52.731
pounds, uh seven dollars 50 um a
lookup. And if it doesn’t work
you don't have to pay. It’s all

00:28:52.731,00:28:57.736
good. So this was explicitly
marketing to bounty hunters as
well. And I actually published

00:29:00.072,00:29:05.077
this last year sh, uh shortly
after the Ron Wyden one. And
nobody uh, I, uh I, it, it

00:29:07.546,00:29:10.582
didn’t, it, nobody really paid
attention to it. I mean I was
glad we got it out because I had

00:29:10.582,00:29:14.820
never heard about this before.
But it didn’t uh it didn’t get
much attention. But this is the

00:29:14.820,00:29:20.759
story that actually triggered
the main phone pinging source at
the top of the talk, to come

00:29:20.759,00:29:26.798
forward and say hey there’s a
company that’s still doing this.
And this isn’t just a US

00:29:26.798,00:29:31.303
problem. Uh I know a lot of uh
my articles especially and other
people who may, maybe talked

00:29:31.303,00:29:36.708
about, they’re quite US focused
but this is, I mean it’s not
global but it is in other

00:29:36.708,00:29:43.215
countries. So this is a
screenshot from a map that
someone sent me uh from a

00:29:43.215,00:29:50.055
company called I think it’s
Telesign. Uh I may have, or
Telesigns. But they provide, you

00:29:50.055,00:29:54.893
know, two FA solutions. So if
you want to implement some sort
of turn key solution for I need

00:29:54.893,00:29:59.097
to have SMS to appear on my
website, these guys will help
you as far as I know. Uh they

00:29:59.097,00:30:03.502
have like Salesforce um as
clients, that sort of thing. And
then you go on their website,

00:30:03.502,00:30:08.006
you look up their capabilities
and their coverage and then
about half way down there, phone

00:30:08.006,00:30:12.110
ID current location plus. Which
isn’t exactly subtle in what it
does. Obviously it provides the

00:30:12.110,00:30:16.848
current location of the phone.
Um and in blue are the places
where they have services

00:30:16.848,00:30:21.853
available. United States,
Canada, India uh and then coming
soon the Philippines. So when uh

00:30:25.457,00:30:30.295
a source sent me this of course
I contacted Telesign, like, so
where’d you get this data. That,

00:30:30.295,00:30:34.566
that, that’s, that’s pretty
interesting. Uh they immediately
took the map offline and

00:30:34.566,00:30:40.172
replied, we don’t sell that
data. I don’t know why you have
a, a map online advertising this

00:30:40.172,00:30:44.843
data if you don’t sell it or you
don’t have any clients. But um,
that’s allegedly uh what they

00:30:44.843,00:30:49.848
say. Um so after we did the
phone pinging story where we
geolocated the phone um AT and

00:30:53.218,00:30:58.223
T, T-Mobile and Sprint said they
were gonna stop the sale of
location data to all third

00:31:00.358,00:31:05.363
parties. Um and as far as we
know that went into effect for
all of them in May. Uh as I

00:31:07.866,00:31:12.671
said, Verizon who had already
done it. But now all the major
tel co’s are not selling uh that

00:31:12.671,00:31:17.676
particular uh supply chain of
location data um to anyone. Uh
it seems. But obviously that is

00:31:21.580,00:31:26.585
not the end. As I said, there is
another section um on how this
data uh can still be obtained uh

00:31:29.821,00:31:36.495
today. So, let’s say you’re an
attacker and you wanna get hold
of some real time location data

00:31:36.495,00:31:42.701
from a tel co. All you really
need to do is pose as law
enforcement, you phone up the

00:31:42.701,00:31:46.037
carrier, you send them an email
and you get the location data.
Obviously this is a massive

00:31:46.037,00:31:51.042
over-simplification. So uh to
give a more concrete um example,
there was an uh a case a few

00:31:54.179,00:32:00.152
years ago, a guy called John
Edens. He is a, a debt
collector. When someone’s behind

00:32:00.152,00:32:03.989
they’re payments on their cars
he’s tasked by an insurance
company or a dealership or

00:32:03.989,00:32:09.561
whatever. So, can you goo,
please go find the person so we
can repossess this vehicle. Um

00:32:09.561,00:32:14.266
he has a history of domestic
violence and stalking. Uh
beating his wife, various other

00:32:14.266,00:32:19.271
um charges and prosecutions. He
had a habit of posing as um US
Marshals. Um he would make some

00:32:23.975,00:32:29.347
spoof email addresses, I think
he would spoof phone numbers as
well. And he would contact in

00:32:29.347,00:32:34.352
particular T-Mobile. Um, and
then with that, T-Mobile would
handily uh reply with the

00:32:37.389,00:32:43.662
location data of a number of his
choosing. Um he didn’t have to
provide, you know, warrants or

00:32:43.662,00:32:46.932
anything like that and obviously
he can't because he’s not
actually law enforcement. But he

00:32:46.932,00:32:53.538
would provide fake exigent
circumstances requests. And this
is where um law enforcement

00:32:53.538,00:32:57.843
think there is, you know, there
is a threat of life and it’s too
urgent to go through the normal

00:32:57.843,00:33:00.879
process of going to a magistrate
judge, getting a warrant,
getting that back and then we

00:33:00.879,00:33:05.350
get the data. It’s like a child
has been kidnapped, we need this
um this data immediately

00:33:05.350,00:33:09.654
because, you know, there’s an
imminent risk of harm. The FBI
have used this um in various

00:33:09.654,00:33:14.292
other ways uh in a slight
different way to do, you know,
deploy malware against um child

00:33:14.292,00:33:19.831
abusers and that sort of thing.
So he would contact T-Mobile
pretending to be US Marshals. He

00:33:19.831,00:33:25.470
would do it on certain days or
certain times of the day um so
particular people were working.

00:33:25.470,00:33:30.575
He would build a rapport with
them, you know, normal social
engineering. Wouldn’t contact

00:33:30.575,00:33:34.913
them when it would be um, you
know, maybe there’s someone
who’s quite strict and they’re

00:33:34.913,00:33:39.885
not gonna give out the data, he
would try to avoid them. Um but
he would get through to the

00:33:39.885,00:33:43.922
right person. And then so you
see they would eventually,
eventually reply with the, with

00:33:43.922,00:33:50.462
the lat, the long uh and uh the
handy Google Maps interface. So
this is a, uh, I mean this is a

00:33:50.462,00:33:54.532
screenshot from one of the
documents in his court case. He
was caught, he was prosecuted um

00:33:54.532,00:34:00.906
I think he’s out now. Um the DHA
redacted the phone number but
they did not redact the GPS

00:34:00.906,00:34:06.344
coordinates so I’ve done that
because I think that’s quite
wild to put a victim of abuse’s

00:34:06.344,00:34:12.384
GPS coordinates in a court
document. But there you go. Um
you can see that the data’s 2014

00:34:12.384,00:34:17.355
so that’s obviously a long time
ago but someone else was
indicted either two or three

00:34:17.355,00:34:23.295
months ago for doing the same to
Verizon. To doing to to AT and T
and T-Mobile um I think. And

00:34:23.295,00:34:28.500
potentially Sprint as well but
basically a selection of the
large tel co’s including Verizon

00:34:28.500,00:34:33.505
as far as I know. Um and people
are doing this approach now
today and they, they may do it

00:34:35.774,00:34:40.111
for their own purpose. They may
do it like John Edens did where
I need to find this person, I

00:34:40.111,00:34:44.082
need to track where their car is
and repossess it. Sure,
whatever. But there are people

00:34:44.082,00:34:50.889
who will do this as a service
and then they will sell that
data um on the black market. And

00:34:50.889,00:34:57.362
these are text messages uh
between two people doing just
that. So um on the left hand

00:34:57.362,00:35:03.969
side is the person selling the
phone pings. On the right hand
side is the um debt collector,

00:35:03.969,00:35:08.840
the skip tracer, saying hey
here’s the phone number could
you look it up? And I think this

00:35:08.840,00:35:15.213
is on telegram. And you can just
see how casual it is. It’s hey
here’s the phone numbers for

00:35:15.213,00:35:20.218
right now, here’s another phone
number. They reply with the lat
long um and the diameter of the

00:35:22.220,00:35:28.093
lookup. And then thank you,
smiley face. Um they may do
another one but the powers, the,

00:35:28.093,00:35:32.330
allegedly the phone’s turned off
so maybe they didn’t get a
reading. Um and then you also

00:35:32.330,00:35:38.003
see on the second screenshot on
the right hand side on the, you
know, the second message down,

00:35:38.003,00:35:43.908
it says for 11 PM PST. Obviously
if you’re a bounty hunter, you
don't necessarily want to have a

00:35:43.908,00:35:49.381
lookup um straight away. If
someone’s in bed, say at five
AM, that’s going to be a pretty

00:35:49.381,00:35:54.586
good time to get there real time
location data. Or because then
of course you can go maybe kick

00:35:54.586,00:35:59.491
down the door or apprehend them
when they’re um least expecting
it. From what I understand, this

00:35:59.491,00:36:05.397
person was selling legitimate,
real, genuine phone pings
through that scamming system

00:36:05.397,00:36:10.769
outlined, reselling them. But
then when they um they lost
their capability somehow, I

00:36:10.769,00:36:15.073
don’t know if the tel co’s
caught on or uh maybe there was
a new staff member at the tel

00:36:15.073,00:36:21.913
co’s, something like that. Um
they wouldn’t able, they weren’t
able to um do that any longer so

00:36:21.913,00:36:27.886
they started scamming um people.
And saying that they would take
numbers, they would allegedoo,

00:36:27.886,00:36:32.123
le, allegedly do lookups and
then just send some cord,
coordinates and still take on

00:36:32.123,00:36:37.595
the 300, 500 dollars. And this
has caused um a lot of issues in
the bounty hunting industry with

00:36:37.595,00:36:43.935
people scamming each other. And
after our coverage where the tel
co’s stopped selling it um we’ve

00:36:43.935,00:36:49.741
seen a spike of scams where um
people will do, you know, quite
good looking. Here’s an auto

00:36:49.741,00:36:55.113
form, a PDF, we’re IT
consultants and we will do a
lookup for you um in India, in

00:36:55.113,00:37:01.252
the US as well um, but they are
scammers. It’s similar to how,
you know, there’s almost the

00:37:01.252,00:37:06.257
unicorn of criminal first
service SS7 access, which does
happen but when someone says or

00:37:08.827,00:37:13.031
someone reports, here’s a toll
hidden service, you give em 500
bucks and you get SS7 lookup

00:37:13.031,00:37:18.136
it’s probably gonna be a fake,
right? And that seems to be the
case here. But among the fakes

00:37:18.136,00:37:22.874
there are people who are people
who are still genuinely doing
this um and if you have the

00:37:22.874,00:37:27.145
right contact you can do
whatever you want with that
data. You, you can stalk

00:37:27.145,00:37:32.517
someone, you can trace your
boyfriend, your girlfriend,
whoever. The person uh one of

00:37:32.517,00:37:38.289
the clients with Securus was
doing it to look up the position
of a judge. Uh I know people who

00:37:38.289,00:37:43.461
have uh allegedly done it to
their ex wives. Uh and again
John Eden’s had a history of

00:37:43.461,00:37:48.900
domestic violence and when he
would track someone he would
turn up at that house uh be very

00:37:48.900,00:37:53.905
violent, be very intimidating.
And just the risk of abuse here
is um so great. So that’s

00:37:57.976,00:38:02.013
everything uh I wanted to
present. Again, if you know
anything about location data,

00:38:02.013,00:38:07.352
who’s buying it, who’s selling
it, um any sort of capability
there. Uh of course it’s not

00:38:07.352,00:38:12.190
just phone carriers it’s apps as
well. If anyone can buy that
data that’s my signal, my Wickr,

00:38:12.190,00:38:16.427
my Jabber, my email. And um I
think I actually rushed through
that so if anyone has any

00:38:16.427,00:38:20.431
questions I’m happy to ask. If
not uh if you don’t want to talk
to me, an investigative

00:38:20.431,00:38:25.670
journalist, in front of a crowd
of a load of hackers uh you can
send me a signal message and we

00:38:25.670,00:38:30.675
can meet later. And thank you so
much I appreciate it. [audience
applause]
