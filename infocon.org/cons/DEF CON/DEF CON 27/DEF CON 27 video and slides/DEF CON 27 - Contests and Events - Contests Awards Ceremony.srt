00:00:12.279,00:00:17.985
Contests and Events: Not 1 talk,
not ever! Alright so thank you
for creating all the content

00:00:17.985,00:00:22.356
that keeps people from going to
something they can watch later
on Youtube. And speaking of

00:00:22.356,00:00:27.861
Youtube uh they’re recording
this so this will eventually go
online so if you want to come up

00:00:27.861,00:00:32.666
here and be in the Youtube video
too, you can do that. Wha- like
really we’re off the rails

00:00:32.666,00:00:39.439
completely here, just do

[laughter] Alright just so you

00:00:39.439,00:00:45.746

ballroom so the big giant over

00:00:45.746,00:00:50.117

the black badges will be

00:00:50.117,00:00:55.055
awarded. So I already thanked
you. Yes- >>And the raffle
>>That is also where the raffle

00:00:55.055,00:00:59.993

>>Alright um and then uh big
thanks to our contest and events

00:01:02.763,00:01:07.467
goons. You may have seen them
sitting on their a*ses uh on the
couches in the center of the

00:01:07.467,00:01:12.472
contest area. It’s a hard job;
um the hardest of all the goon
jobs I think. Um so thanks guys!

00:01:20.113,00:01:23.550
[applause] They really held
those couches right to the
ground. I mean, without them

00:01:23.550,00:01:29.022
there, they would have floated
up to the ceiling and just
danger, um. Alright. So let’s

00:01:29.022,00:01:33.026
get this kicked off with the
beverage cooling contraption
contest. If you’re in here,

00:01:33.026,00:01:37.464
here’s how this is gonna roll.
You get 2 minutes. Talk about
really quick what your contest

00:01:37.464,00:01:43.503
was, what people had to do and
then who won. Is there anybody
from beverage cooling? This

00:01:43.503,00:01:48.709
isn’t going to be a dumpster
fire. [laughter] >>And
apparently y’all didn’t hear

00:01:48.709,00:01:52.913
Grifter say- >>Wait! >>Get in
the line! >>Are you coming to
get a selfie? Or are you with

00:01:52.913,00:01:57.284
the beverage cooling- ok.
[laughter] Are you gonna come
and get beverage cooling and

00:01:57.284,00:02:01.388
selfies? [laughter] Answer the
question about the selfie!
>>[unclear] [laughter] >>He

00:02:01.388,00:02:05.859
doesn’t do selfies. >>So if
y’all could actually physically
remove yourself from the seat

00:02:05.859,00:02:11.198
and start lining up as we go
alphabetically so Grifter
doesn’t have to watch you climb

00:02:11.198,00:02:15.335
out of the seat. [laughter]
>>What oh you’re taking a
picture ok. So to uh start this

00:02:15.335,00:02:18.705
dumpster fire off- >>It’s
alphabetical [laughter] >>I’m
beverage chilling. I’m first

00:02:18.705,00:02:24.778
because we’re a dumpster fire,
it’s fine. So uh this year-
>>Lean into the mic, into the

00:02:24.778,00:02:29.783
mic, lean in. >>This year we had
what 4? 4 teams. 4 teams. It
sucks, come on guys we need more

00:02:32.219,00:02:37.691
teams, seriously. >>And it’s a
free beer. >>We have an after
party and it’s free beer! If you

00:02:37.691,00:02:43.830
compete you go to our
afterparty. Come on it’s easy!
Anyway! So we had 4 teams, 1

00:02:43.830,00:02:48.835
team brought a contraption for
Unlimited, it did not go well,
but that’s fine. We had 3 hack

00:02:50.937,00:02:55.942
teams and over here no oh there
he is, we have team Hebrew. Our
first place. They got the target

00:02:58.078,00:03:03.016
temperature of 44 degrees in 1
point 5 minutes. Which is ok.
[laughter] Congratulations.

00:03:10.590,00:03:16.163
[applause] Yay. So going forward
I would like to see more people
there. We’re going to continue

00:03:16.163,00:03:22.269
to fight to get into better
places. Can we go in the the
smoking area by the Paris? You

00:03:22.269,00:03:25.839
know when you’re walking out
there next time? >>Like just you
and me after this or? [laughter]

00:03:25.839,00:03:30.710
>>Yeah. >>No selfies. >>Yeah. >>
Absolutely. >>Alright, let’s go.
>>You’re a handsome man. >>I

00:03:30.710,00:03:36.116
meant for like next year. Thank

year? I was kinda hoping today?

00:03:36.116,00:03:40.287
>>Alright well I’ll I’ll I’ll-
uh I’ll let them uh continue on
to the next contest. I think

00:03:40.287,00:03:44.591
I’ve wasted my 2 minutes so.
Congratulations team Hebrew!
Everybody- >>So- >>Once again-

00:03:44.591,00:03:50.263
Yeah. Alight thank you. >>So
real- real quick, if you are
winners, you can come up here on

00:03:50.263,00:03:54.701
stage as they announce you. We’d
like y’all to come back this
way, we’ll get a little bit more

00:03:54.701,00:03:59.072
information from you and then
you can go drink and party and-
>>Alright so just so you know if

00:03:59.072,00:04:04.010
you are a uh a first place team
like we don’t have a lot of
black badges right. So um you

00:04:06.646,00:04:11.985
you get a ba- a human badge
that’s it. I mean it’s more than
nothing, right? So um if you’re

00:04:11.985,00:04:16.156
part of the first place team
then just roll down there and
talk to these guys and they’ll

00:04:16.156,00:04:21.161
uh take your information so next
year you can pick it up at reg.
Fo free! >>Next year. Next year.

00:04:26.700,00:04:31.705
[cheers and applause] >>Alright.
Oh here they come. That’s
gorgeous. >>I guess I’m semi

00:04:37.377,00:04:42.382
alphabetical. >>Nn- hi. So we’re
the biohacking village. Um this
year we had uh a really crazy

00:04:44.951,00:04:50.290
setup we had a fully immersive
hospital set up that was part of
our cap- capture the flag. So

00:04:50.290,00:04:55.195
you would go into these
different hospital rooms, look
for things, super fun. Uh we had

00:04:55.195,00:04:58.165
uh a bunch of people come
through. Anybody want to guess
how many people we had come

00:04:58.165,00:05:03.103
through just the CTF area?
[crowd yelling guesses] The
correct answer is over 9000. I’m

00:05:05.772,00:05:10.110
disappointed in you all. We had
over 9000 people come through
that environment, a bunch of

00:05:10.110,00:05:14.915
them played the CTF. I’ll hand
it over to Fotos to tell you
about uh who played the CTF and

00:05:14.915,00:05:19.920
how they did it. >>Yes uh so we
had uh like over 40 teams uh
smallest 1 was 1 player, uh

00:05:22.155,00:05:28.161
biggest 1 was 8 team members. We
had uh many challenges uh
including emulated medical

00:05:28.161,00:05:33.033
devices, you know hacking
healthcare protocols. The idea
was that the hospital is under

00:05:33.033,00:05:39.639
um a cyber attack and you’re
leading an IT security team to
make sure, you know, uh you

00:05:39.639,00:05:44.644
remediate everything by also
showcasing some of the offensive
uh techniques. Uh against um you

00:05:46.780,00:05:51.785
know targets. So uh the winner
is uh murphlaw, uh is anyone
from their team here to get the

00:05:55.689,00:06:01.161
prize? I hope there is otherwise
you’ll have to claim it
afterwards. >>You can just stick

00:06:01.161,00:06:05.198
‘em back here and the goons will
divy them up at the end. >>OK
>>We’ll just take ‘em all with

00:06:05.198,00:06:11.404
us. [laughter] >>Anybody who
doesn’t show up for this we’ll-
we’ll raffle it off at the end.

00:06:11.404,00:06:15.875
[laughter] >>Just use the same
ticket you already have. >>Yeah
so >>Alright yeah cool >>Cool

00:06:15.875,00:06:20.714
>>Thank you >>Thank you
[applause] >>Alright, crack me
if you can. It’s you. >>Hi

00:06:20.714,00:06:25.719
everyone. Uh I’m Minga with
KoreLogic. I uh started Crack Me
If You Can. Uh it’s our ninth

00:06:35.362,00:06:41.468
year, so it’s the password
cracking contest. It’s- it’s- so
yeah it’s our ninth year. This

00:06:41.468,00:06:44.638
year’s theme was uh change your
password and it was kinda like
based off of uh NIST coming out

00:06:44.638,00:06:49.643
and telling people not to change
their password which is uh uh-
not my preferred opinion. And so

00:06:53.480,00:06:58.618
the main thing we did this year
was we gave the teams historical
passwords of individual users

00:06:58.618,00:07:02.856
you know oh here’s their old
password and you have to guess
their new password. And when

00:07:02.856,00:07:07.460
humans change their password
they do it in a- you know they
don’t make it completely random,

00:07:07.460,00:07:12.966
they do things due to human
nature. Uh but the- the main
thing we did that was mean was

00:07:12.966,00:07:19.639
we used scrypt for the new
hashes and we uh booped- we- we
uh we made the amount of loops

00:07:19.639,00:07:25.345
be uh an amount that’s higher
than normal but still it fits
the standard and uh by the way

00:07:25.345,00:07:28.982
it’s not supported by Hashcat
out of box and so they have to
fix their code and everything

00:07:28.982,00:07:34.454
along those lines. Uh and so uh
so that was the the you know
that’s the- that’s the jist of

00:07:34.454,00:07:38.458
the contest. The teams have 48
hours, they go non stop. The
teams are have- however big as

00:07:38.458,00:07:44.597
they want. Uh back to the
scrypts that’s about 200 tries a
second per GPU card uh so it’s

00:07:44.597,00:07:50.503
really really slow. Um so uh
just real quick if I can rant
for 10 seconds uh you know

00:07:50.503,00:07:55.442
everyone does password cracking,
we all do it wether part of our
job, things like that so like

00:07:55.442,00:08:00.213
but it’s just not sexy anymore.
The community is shrinking. So
like I really would like to have

00:08:00.213,00:08:05.251
more people come in and join in.
>>10 seconds is up. Get off.
>>Yeah. [laughter] So anyways.

00:08:05.251,00:08:11.491
Uh so teams will do write ups,
teams will share their code,
they’ll push out Hashcat John

00:08:11.491,00:08:15.795
fixes and everything like that.
They’ll publish write ups and
since it’s the ninth year you

00:08:15.795,00:08:19.632
can go back and read the write
ups over the past 9 years and
learn how to be a better

00:08:19.632,00:08:22.869
password cracker and things
along those lines; so lookout
for those here soon. Uh we have

00:08:22.869,00:08:28.742
a pro and street, the pro team
is Team Hashcat, they won in the
last 10 minutes- last 15 minutes

00:08:28.742,00:08:33.913
of the contest so they were
going back and- back and forth
and the street team is

00:08:33.913,00:08:38.918
HashCraftsMen. Uh so anyways.
Thanks a lot. See you next year.
[applause] >>Alright, creative

00:08:44.924,00:08:50.363
writing. >>They’re probably not
here. >>Anyone anyone anyone?
They’re probably not here?

00:08:50.363,00:08:54.734
>>It’s online and they actually
finish- >>It’s online, they
finish even before DEFCON

00:08:54.734,00:08:59.739
starts. >>Are you gonna repeat
everything I say? >>Bunch of
d*mn try hards. Um so. Beard and

00:09:04.811,00:09:08.648
moustache! Watch out.
>>[chuckles] Wh- cow cow!
>>Incoming Heidi! [laughter]

00:09:08.648,00:09:13.653
>>So- >>We’ve been planning this
for a year. >>So, so Brian
emails me like 15 minutes ago

00:09:16.156,00:09:20.160
and says “Heidi” I’m short I’m
on my tip toes. Thank you. Um “I
haven’t seen any information

00:09:20.160,00:09:25.165
about the winners of the beard
contest.” And my reaction was
“Oh sh*t I was drunk, I don’t

00:09:27.600,00:09:32.605
know.” So I madly texted all the
other judges who then texted me
back and said also “Oh sh*t, I

00:09:35.842,00:09:42.048
don’t remember” so doing the
best we could through [laughter]
mad texts [laughter] we think

00:09:42.048,00:09:46.286
that the winner- are you gonna?
What are you doing? >>I’m not
doing anything. >>Okay >> You’re

00:09:46.286,00:09:50.924
doing great. >>I said please
come up here with me I hate
microphones and then he laughed

00:09:50.924,00:09:55.795
at me. Um the winner of the
beard contest whose name I can’t
remember but we’ll just call him

00:09:55.795,00:09:58.965
a Hot Santa guy. >>[laughs] He’s
right there >>That wasn’t his
real handle we gave it to him.

00:09:58.965,00:10:04.337
>>Ooh ok. >>He was definitely a
Hot Santa. >>So from here on out
he will be Hot Santa Guy. Um the

00:10:04.337,00:10:08.441
winner of oh my gawd the winner-
the winner of the freestyle
contest was a dog. >>He’s right

00:10:08.441,00:10:12.145
there in front of you. >>Shut
up, I know! [laughter] Cause I I
texted- >>She’s just nervous >>

00:10:12.145,00:10:17.984
Him back just a minute ago, was
Brimley, Brimley the dog won the
freestyle contest. [applause]

00:10:17.984,00:10:23.356
Ohhh. And that’s so much easier
to read. The winner of the
stache contest was Hazmat. Now

00:10:23.356,00:10:27.393
here’s the thing with the beard
contest, I know when you guys do
your black badge decisions you

00:10:27.393,00:10:32.665
take into account how much time
the contestants spend, preparing
and playing. >>Oh I see where

00:10:32.665,00:10:37.370
this is going. >>So some of
these guys, 15 years. Just
sayin’! Consider it for next

00:10:37.370,00:10:42.108
year. >>Sorry >>[unclear off-
mic] >>We we had 1 real
neckbeard and it was like 6

00:10:42.108,00:10:45.712
years in the making and it was
about this long and it was
actually pretty impressive that

00:10:45.712,00:10:49.649
he had cultivated it. He could
barely grow any facial hair but
he knew he wanted to be a neck

00:10:49.649,00:10:54.254
beard and he really pulled it
off, it was awesome. [laughter]
>>Um and also we raised. >>Wow

00:10:54.254,00:10:59.392
wait wait. >>Oh sorry. >>Ok fine
take my thunder. >>Well I- >>Um
the real big deal at the beard

00:10:59.392,00:11:03.229
contest is that the beard only
matters about 50 percent of it.
It’s a bunch of bribes see

00:11:03.229,00:11:09.035
liquor and money for the EFF and
this year we raised 2174 dollars
which was a beard contest

00:11:09.035,00:11:14.040
record. >>Yay! [applause]
[laughter] >>Alright DEFCON bike
ride. >>Hey come on back up!

00:11:29.522,00:11:34.394
>>Hi we’re back! >>Don’t- don’t
pay attention to us, we’re-
>>Wait wait wait, wait. Can I?

00:11:34.394,00:11:39.399
Can I do this too? [laughter]
Ok. [laughter and cheers] So um
every year for- >>9! >>9 years,

00:11:46.973,00:11:52.946
thank you. I can’t see that so
it doesn’t matter. Um we have
taken anywhere from I think the

00:11:52.946,00:11:56.749
first year was like 20 to 50
hackers out in to the desert
doing a bike ride very early on

00:11:56.749,00:12:00.053
Friday morning you should all
come with us. >>Um yeah and it
was actually a giant

00:12:00.053,00:12:06.526
misunderstanding uh me and JP um
and uh 1 of the organizers a
couple- 10 years ago uh he said

00:12:06.526,00:12:10.597
what I thought was “We should do
a ride to DEFCON.” And so we
trained for 2 years and we biked

00:12:10.597,00:12:15.001
across country and came uh to
DEFCON when it was at the Rio um
and what he had actually said

00:12:15.001,00:12:19.639
was “We should do a ride at
DEFCON” uh which is slightly
different [laughter] uh a little

00:12:19.639,00:12:23.776
less planning involved but uh he
was a trooper and we rode across
country a few years ago. Uh but

00:12:23.776,00:12:29.382
actually we continued to do this
bike ride uh if you’re
interested it’s uh 23 miles; uh

00:12:29.382,00:12:32.151
we get out there at about 6:30
in the morning, you’re back in
time for the tracks on Friday

00:12:32.151,00:12:35.755
morning, it’s awesome. Uh to
date no one has died. >>You will
curse our name? >>So we’re super

00:12:35.755,00:12:39.225
happy about that. Uh if you
wanna you know hit that record
first, let us know. >>No, no.

00:12:39.225,00:12:43.363
>>No? Oh yeah. >>No. But you
will curse our name all the way
out but I promise you you’ll be

00:12:43.363,00:12:49.636
smiling all the way back in,
it’s super fun. >>Thank you.
[applause] >>Also there’s no

00:12:49.636,00:12:54.641
contest, right. It was all just
like you know participation
trophies. So good job everyone.

00:12:58.111,00:13:03.182
[laughter] >>Then no badge. >>Uh
in a little bit. It’s not- I’m-
I’m hard with the alphabet. So.

00:13:03.182,00:13:08.187
We’ll see. >>Alright uh DEFCON
Ham radio fox hunt. [murmurs
off-mic] >>No. Scav hunt!

00:13:27.774,00:13:34.447
[applause] >>Yeah we need music.
Why don’t we have music? Alright
um hi I’m EvilMofo and uh these

00:13:34.447,00:13:39.452
are some of my fellow judges. Uh
we are more scavenger than
human. Um if you may have

00:13:42.288,00:13:47.293
noticed, we are the best way to

[shouts from crowd] >>If you

00:13:49.395,00:13:55.868
haven’t noticed, we’re sorry,
we’re going to try harder next
year. [laughs] Um so it’s

00:13:55.868,00:14:00.807
important to note this year’s
3rd place team played for 9
hours, they got the list at 2am

00:14:02.875,00:14:07.880
last night, they had to catch a
plane at 11 this morning and
that was most spankable butts.

00:14:11.651,00:14:16.656

>>You know how this works!
>>Storm the stage already!

00:14:43.483,00:14:48.254
>>While we wait for them, what
kind of stuff did they have to
do. >>Uh [murmuring] >>Uh do you

00:14:48.254,00:14:52.525
want to show an example? >>Do
you not know? >>Do I need- do I
need to put a trigger warning on

00:14:52.525,00:14:59.031
this? >>Trigger warning, trigger
warning. >>Uh every year- every
year we have uh everybody comes

00:14:59.031,00:15:05.805
up and asks “Hey what’s the most
uh amazing thing?” And uh this
team turned in a sh- uh shen yun

00:15:05.805,00:15:11.711
blowup doll that was sloppy
seconds from last year that they
tested a Black and Decker

00:15:11.711,00:15:17.116
recter- rectal checker on and
they posted the video to
Pornhub. For 4 items. [applause]

00:15:17.116,00:15:22.121
>>Stuff like that. >>[off-mic
chatter] >>Oh yeah also. You may
have noticed we had a pre con

00:15:31.063,00:15:36.068
list, may I- may I introduce DT!
>>Deep fake of DT. >>No no.
>>Hello DEF CON! I’m excited

00:15:42.642,00:15:47.647
that we’re wrapping up this
contest, it’s only been 27 long
f*cking years of my life. You

00:15:50.416,00:15:57.323
know I- I started this contest
to have fun and now it’s just
wearing on me. >>Puberty is a

00:15:57.323,00:16:01.093
b*tch, huh? >>The stress is too
f*cking much. You know there-
there- are Caesar’s- f*cking

00:16:01.093,00:16:05.965
Caesar’s Palace is up my a*s
every time. I would you- what
are you f*ckers something

00:16:05.965,00:16:11.470
ludacris and then and then the
attendees, there’s no grace with
you either. You just can’t-

00:16:11.470,00:16:16.242
can’t quit- stop your b*tching
at me for every f*cking thing
that goes wrong. You know we

00:16:16.242,00:16:21.347
used to - >>Wow! >>We used to
have this contest- >>How much
material do you have? >>In 1

00:16:21.347,00:16:26.686
hotel! [laughter] In 1 hotel!
And now we have to walk. It used
to be 4 minutes from upstairs,

00:16:26.686,00:16:31.457
and now it’s 4 f*cking miles!
[laughter] I can’t handle it
anymore. You f*ckers are so

00:16:31.457,00:16:36.462
ungracious, we’re cancelling it.
It’s done. DEFCON is over!
>>Yay! [cheers] >>Yay?

00:16:40.099,00:16:45.104
>>Alright. [applause] >>And
we’re walking. >>And you’re
walking. Make sure they stop

00:16:49.442,00:16:54.447
over there. Phew. Holy cr*p.
[laughter] >>You asked us up
here, that was your first

00:17:02.788,00:17:07.793
mistake! >>Alright D20, goodluck
following that. [laughter]
>>Hello so we ran the D20 CTF

00:17:12.031,00:17:18.704
again this year, um slightly
different rules but uh same hot
dog costume wearing maniac

00:17:18.704,00:17:23.409
smashing things with a
sledgehammer. Uh we ran into
some logistical issues that uh

00:17:23.409,00:17:29.515
among various things resulted in
us not having a sledgehammer or
a 20 sided die the day before

00:17:29.515,00:17:33.352
the competition. Uh. >>You can
get those at Walmart. >>Uh we-
we made it work. We made it

00:17:33.352,00:17:38.824
work. But um. >>There’s an app
>>Yeah yeah, exactly.
>>Sledgehammer. >>Walmart is a

00:17:38.824,00:17:43.829
beautiful thing. [laughter] Um.
>>[Unclear off mic] >>I mean
yeah but so we figured it out

00:17:49.001,00:17:54.907
though we made it happen. And I
wanna first uh congratulate our
winners. So in third place with

00:17:54.907,00:18:00.846
uh, you guys can read it. So
becojo on- in third place, uh
RedHatAugust in 2nd place, and

00:18:00.846,00:18:07.253
magnum in first place. So some
notable and awesome things. Uh
magnum solved 3 of the highest

00:18:07.253,00:18:12.258
point challenges uh in the first
20 minutes of the competition
which is f*cking amazing.

00:18:14.994,00:18:19.999
>>Please >>[applause] Um we saw
very serious entries this year.
Uh last year we didn’t really

00:18:22.902,00:18:28.240
have anyone that uh put together
a hardened machine- physically
hardened machine. But this year

00:18:28.240,00:18:34.113
we had multiple competitors so I
want to give a shout out to
Aspen Scythe uh for having a- an

00:18:34.113,00:18:39.118
awesome uh sort of uh acrylic
and wood case around an all in 1
machine, and RedHatAugust had a

00:18:41.153,00:18:46.158
fantastic entry that was a
raspberry pie encased in a solid
block of resin which was then

00:18:48.594,00:18:53.599
suspended by springs inside a
welded metal cage. [applause]
And if you’re wondering still

00:18:59.071,00:19:05.711
which machine survived 4 rounds
of damage including tr- 2- 2
smashes with a sledge hammer,

00:19:05.711,00:19:11.751
that’s the 1. It was good. We’re
gonna have to come up with some
more destruction methods for

00:19:11.751,00:19:17.690
next year. [laughter] Uh
apparently it was tested in a
bathtub, so there was that.

00:19:17.690,00:19:22.995
[laughter] Um so we need to
bring ha ha- uh we need to bring
our A game next year I think. Um

00:19:22.995,00:19:28.000
so uh congratulations to magnum.
Magnum are you here? >>You get
nothing. >>That seems like a no.

00:19:31.504,00:19:36.509
RedHatAugust? >>Also nothing
[crowd chuckles]. >>Well uh,
becojo? [digital feedback]

00:19:42.348,00:19:47.787
>>Nothing again. [laughter]
>>Alright so um. >>I do- I- do
wanna ask, like you guys

00:19:47.787,00:19:54.193
collaborated though as well with
another group this uh this
conference didn’t you? >>Yes

00:19:54.193,00:19:59.665
sort of. Again the logistical
issues prevented us from doing a
lot of stuff that we wanted to.

00:19:59.665,00:20:04.670
Uh but yes we collaborated with
the car hack village um and they
did a bunch of destruction stuff

00:20:07.006,00:20:13.212
in a very D20 way with their uh
uh grand prize Tesla. >>Yeah.
>>And we did manage to get our

00:20:13.212,00:20:18.217
Tesla gun to them to Tesla the
Tesla. So that ha- that’s a win.
A small win, but a win. Um so-

00:20:22.321,00:20:27.326
>>Get your shit together man!
[laughter] >>I, so, yeah I know.
>>Yeah. Okay. Yes >>Yes. I’m not

00:20:29.662,00:20:35.835
even arguing, yes. [laughter]
Yes. Um thank you to everyone
who played and we definitely

00:20:35.835,00:20:42.141
will be coming back next year.
Also um in case you didn’t know,
we do offer a prize uh for

00:20:42.141,00:20:46.445
winning the D20 CTF which is
that you get to be the hot dog
costume wearing maniac that

00:20:46.445,00:20:51.450
destroys computers the next
year. Um [crowd murmurs] so.
>>That’s pretty good. >>That’s a

00:20:54.687,00:21:00.826
good prize. >>Thank you
everybody. [applause] >>Dungeons
at DEFCON. Are you- are you

00:21:00.826,00:21:07.066
here? >>Nah >>Oh that’s right.
Wait. These are black badge.
>>Well then keep going! >>Well,

00:21:07.066,00:21:13.806
hold up I just noticed the-
what- what the hell was going on
in that screen when- when DT was

00:21:13.806,00:21:18.811
up here talking? [crowd
shouting] Was it really? >>Yeah
[laughter] Damn. >>Written

00:21:21.413,00:21:26.418
record. >>Hacker Runway >>Mmmhmm
>>Why doesn’t it say Hacker
Runway up there? >>So you got

00:21:32.057,00:21:37.062
everything the sock puppet said?
[laughter] But I speak and- I
feel slighted. [laughter] That

00:21:42.067,00:21:47.072
also, now. Uh Hack Fortress.
>>Hi! >>Oh hey! These guys!
>>These guys! >>Don’t you guys

00:21:52.478,00:21:59.118
do enough? >>This is the last 1
I promise. Because I’m sick of
Grifter’s sh*t. [laughter] Um so

00:21:59.118,00:22:03.923
first of all if team BigDogge is
here, anybody from them come on
up. Uh probably not but what the

00:22:03.923,00:22:10.029
f*ck so um. Uh we run Hack
Fortress. We’ve been doing this
for 7 or 8 years. Uh we at

00:22:10.029,00:22:13.499
ShmooCon we would- we used to do
this thing called Hacker Halo. A
bunch of hackers had uh uh- a

00:22:13.499,00:22:17.203
bunch of hacking contests and
people just blew each other up
on Halo and then we combined

00:22:17.203,00:22:22.441
scores and the best score won.
Uh 1 year at DEF CON uh I
decided to do a clandestine LAN

00:22:22.441,00:22:27.680
party in my track room before my
talk on Sunday morning. Uh so a
bunch of randos and I got

00:22:27.680,00:22:34.286
together and did Team Fortress 2
at 9am on Sunday, which meant
there was 2 of us. Uh it’s

00:22:34.286,00:22:37.856
really. Uh actually we had a
good audience, what was
interesting is there was a large

00:22:37.856,00:22:41.193
number of people watching me and
another dude like blowing each
other up on Team Fortress 2 and

00:22:41.193,00:22:44.730
I’m like “Hmm this seems like
there might be something here.”
So we ended up taking out Halo

00:22:44.730,00:22:48.267
and dropped in Team Fortress
with a source engine which
allows us to in real time

00:22:48.267,00:22:51.537
manipulate what’s going on in
the game. So then we hiccuped
the hacking competition so the

00:22:51.537,00:22:55.407
hackers when they reach
objectives can do things like
redeem points to set the other

00:22:55.407,00:23:01.614
team fortress team uh 2 on- on
fire and things like that. So
very interactive uh uh game. We

00:23:01.614,00:23:04.850
designed it as like a spectator
thing; crowd around, we’ve got
scoreboards we stream it on

00:23:04.850,00:23:09.488
Twitch the whole deal. Um and
this year Team Bigdogge won,
this is their third in a row.

00:23:09.488,00:23:14.593
They won DEF CON last year,
Shmoocon, and then DEFCON again.
So uh they get the giant iron

00:23:14.593,00:23:17.730
wrench that they have to somehow
take home through the airport
which costs them a lot of money

00:23:17.730,00:23:21.200
because it puts their bag over
50 pounds, so anyway! [laughter]
>>Tell ‘em- tell ‘em about the-

00:23:21.200,00:23:25.738
tell ‘em about the blue team
guy. >>Oh! 1 of the uh 1 of the
challenges uh in the final 1 was

00:23:25.738,00:23:30.743
social engineering um and they
uh they had to uh find the alien
through an Area 51 uh river run

00:23:32.778,00:23:38.617
rush um, and then uh once you
got to the alien you had to
pitch them as if they were a

00:23:38.617,00:23:43.856
foreign VC investor, uh for
whatever logo was on your shirt.
So we had a guy running around

00:23:43.856,00:23:50.129
the conference area chasing her
in her uh alien outfit um and
then sat there and pitched Black

00:23:50.129,00:23:55.367
Hat, because that was the hoodie
wore. >>Oh no. >>Um and had such
zingers such as “Things escalate

00:23:55.367,00:23:59.338
quickly at Black Hat because
they have 3 escalators.”
[laughter] Uh and “I’ve- and

00:23:59.338,00:24:03.842
I’ve never seen an alien with
glasses, that’s quite a
spectacle.” So he um- we gave

00:24:03.842,00:24:07.346
him a challenge coin because he
basically punned his way through
a venture pitch. Also if you’re

00:24:07.346,00:24:10.649
a VC, I would talk to that guy,
cause he’s pretty f*cking smart
as it turns out. [crowd murmurs]

00:24:10.649,00:24:15.654
So anyway thank you very much.
[applause] >>Home brew hardware.
Anyone? Ah ha! >>Oh, sneaking

00:24:20.359,00:24:25.364
through the back door. >>I just
thought you were attacking me.
>>Yeah, we try to. Hey what’s up

00:24:33.138,00:24:38.143
uh I’m LP, I run the Homebrew
Hardware contest. Uh generally
the basic premise is people make

00:24:40.846,00:24:45.484
a ton of cool sh*t, and we
wanted to give a space to show
it off, so we did. Um this was

00:24:45.484,00:24:51.623
our first year. We had a pretty
good time. Uh if- if anyone else
is out in the audience like

00:24:51.623,00:24:58.330
third or second place, come on
up here. Um but third place went
to Ian Taber for his slcan car

00:24:58.330,00:25:04.436
hacking device. It was pretty
wicked. Uh second place went to
BanhammersWrath, he 3d printed

00:25:04.436,00:25:10.209
this pretty awesome rave mask
thing that kind of looks like a
bird. Um and first place went to

00:25:10.209,00:25:15.214
Gretchen from Genderhackers for
their SNES cartridge badge which
is like a whole SNES game and a

00:25:18.050,00:25:24.256
badge at one. Um I just wanted
to do a shoutout, thank you to
contest and events for bringing

00:25:24.256,00:25:29.261
us, that’s really cool. Um the
judges, el Cantaro, SecBarbie
and Zoz and then HighWiz, um he

00:25:31.530,00:25:36.402
like pulls everyone into
everything and I had a tiny idea
and I feel like he made it

00:25:36.402,00:25:40.806
happen and dragged me the whole
way and that’s badass. Sorry you
can’t be here dude, love you.

00:25:40.806,00:25:45.811
>>I also love HighWiz.
[applause] >>Hold on. [applause]
>>I just wanted to say um a

00:25:52.117,00:25:57.423
month ago I had no idea how to
make a game, make a PCB or do
anything, and I ended up winning

00:25:57.423,00:26:02.361
a contest a month later. So just
jump into stuff and have fun,
and just do it. [applause]

00:26:06.899,00:26:12.771
>>That was like a verbal b*tch
slap to all of you. Like
[laughter] like it was like “Oh,

00:26:12.771,00:26:17.776
uh, did you try hard at this?”
[laughter] I learned a month ago
and I won!” [laughter] Alright

00:26:23.649,00:26:28.654
maps of the digital lands. Yay?
[applause] >>Oh wow that’s
bright. Hi there uh my name is

00:26:40.632,00:26:46.538
Tito, we’ve got uh we- we did
the maps of the digital land. Uh
what we did was we allowed

00:26:46.538,00:26:52.611
people to draw maps of scenarios
that represented different
business cases. Uh we- we had a

00:26:52.611,00:26:58.217
lot of interesting uh
submissions uh a lot of people
who really knew their networking

00:26:58.217,00:27:02.654
stuff, and uh and we kept
hearing that there wasn’t enough
networking- network engineering

00:27:02.654,00:27:08.293
stuff going on at DEF CON so it
sounds like we filled a void.
Um. And we even had a little

00:27:08.293,00:27:12.898
thing where you could submit
drawings if they weren’t network
diagrams and we had a nice

00:27:12.898,00:27:17.503
little collection going on that.
Um I’m going to let John
continue from that. >>So we’re

00:27:17.503,00:27:22.107
just going to go off the uh
winners we got 1 through first
place actually let’s go third

00:27:22.107,00:27:28.380
place, is nomad_69. [unclear] Is
nomad_69 up in the building?
[speaking over each other]

00:27:28.380,00:27:33.385
>>We’ve got a bunch of uh
[laughs] 4 Lokos [laughter] >>4
Loko baby [chuckles] >>If

00:27:35.587,00:27:38.757
they’re not here we’ll just pass
‘em down. >>Second place is
coloq >>[audience member

00:27:38.757,00:27:42.227
yelling] >>Hi. >>Coloq 73?
[unclear off mic] >>[unclear off
mic] >>What was that? >>His Mom

00:27:42.227,00:27:45.898
said he’s not here. >>Oh ok.
[laughter] He’s not here.
[laughs] >>She’s like “I know, I

00:27:45.898,00:27:50.903
drove him home.” [laughter]
>>Who’s first place man?
>>Brute’s the winner, that’s

00:27:57.309,00:28:02.247
him. >>And uh Brute first place,
Brute? >>That’s coloq, same

00:28:04.349,00:28:09.621
weird. I- I’m sorry this slide’s
a little uh off, Mike- Mike D
was actually our 3rd place

00:28:09.621,00:28:14.860
winner. >>Oh. >>Yeah he’s over
in the DEFCON nod. Um and then
nomad underscore I don’t know

00:28:14.860,00:28:20.399
where the 69 came from. Um. >>It
was in the email, I don’t know.
>>That was their score

00:28:20.399,00:28:25.103
[laughter] >>You guys have been
drinking >>Oh the score you put
the score, oh ok . [laughter]

00:28:25.103,00:28:30.142
>>It wasn’t a spreadsheet or
anything, it was just words.
[laughter] >>I mean it’s it came

00:28:30.142,00:28:34.947
directly out of the email,
they've been drinking a lot of 4
Loko, right, I wanna say.

00:28:34.947,00:28:38.550
[audience laughs] >>It’s just in
his autocorrect, it’s fine. >>Oh

00:29:24.896,00:29:29.901
>>Oh man. It’s an invasion. >>Oh

I keep saying it, eh? [laughter]

00:29:38.477,00:29:43.482
>>NoProblem if you’re here, come
on up. >> Alright then. Open CTF
is DEF CON’s approachable CTF

00:29:46.818,00:29:50.589
designed to be played throughout
the con and introduce new
players to the game with no

00:29:50.589,00:29:56.194
pre-qualification required. Now
under new management, Van passed
the torch to long time players

00:29:56.194,00:30:02.200
and previous winners Neg9 as the
new contest organizers this
year. >>[unclear offmic] >>570

00:30:02.200,00:30:07.205
users competed on 229 teams over
54 problems that ranged from
cryptography to recon, pwn-ables

00:30:09.775,00:30:14.312
to reverse engineering, we even
gave out hardware and a chip
that had multiple challenges on

00:30:14.312,00:30:18.583
board. While many challenges
were intended to be easy, we
also had a few problems we

00:30:18.583,00:30:23.722
believe were as hard as the
problems in the DEF CON CTF. The
fight for the top 10 was intense

00:30:23.722,00:30:28.060
changing- with second and third
place teams changing position
less than 45 minutes before the

00:30:28.060,00:30:33.565
close. But in the end of the
day, 1 team emerged as clear
winners. Without further ado, in

00:30:33.565,00:30:38.570
third place with 200 and hmm-
2040 points is IE6. In second
place, OpenToAll had 2152 points

00:30:44.209,00:30:51.216
[audience member cheers] and the
winners of open CTF at DEFCON 27
are NoProblem with 2936 points.

00:30:51.216,00:30:56.888
Please come to the front to
claim your prize if you’re here.
[audience applauds] Thanks

Trace Labs. We did the Missing
Person CTF using an OSINT all

00:31:54.112,00:31:59.951
day yesterday. So we had about
over 200 contestants across 50
teams gathering some very

00:31:59.951,00:32:05.557
valuable intelligence on real
missing people. Um there was 1
clear winner throughout the

00:32:05.557,00:32:10.896
whole day um team Wookies they
showed up right at 10 am to
start. They went the whole day

00:32:10.896,00:32:15.367
almost no breaks um so
congratulations to team Wookies
on taking that away. [audience

00:32:15.367,00:32:20.372
applauds] Um we had about over
2000 unique intelligence
submissions throughout the day.

00:32:22.874,00:32:27.879
Team Wookies accounted for about
150 of these which was fantastic
and that’s why they were the

00:32:31.416,00:32:37.055
clear winner and they will be
getting access to offensive
security Pen Testers Cali

00:32:37.055,00:32:42.761

a recon with the CTF which was
focused around open sourced
intelligence and finding

00:33:57.869,00:34:02.340
information around certain
people. We had a winner which
was a clear winner from the very

00:34:02.340,00:34:07.312
starting but they have been
competing from last 3 years and
they were doing bang on. So I

00:34:07.312,00:34:12.584

Alert ICS CTF >>Alright >>Cool
thanks guys. >>Mm my boots.
>>Hello! Er. Second year this

00:35:50.148,00:35:55.153
year for us so uh if you happen
to walk around and you see uh
some smart city lights uh

00:36:02.961,00:36:07.966
blinking with uh with a freakin
crane and some other stuff there
then that’s us. So uh this year

00:36:10.068,00:36:15.073
uh we had about similar to last
year about 30 teams and uh first
3 places are here. Third place

00:36:17.409,00:36:22.414
is mmmmmmmodbus, he had uh 1460
points. HaxWells uh 1009 and
CTF.SG is 3006 so they played

00:36:29.421,00:36:35.894
really hard. Uh we also had uh-
I mean 1 of the highlights which
we can bring is uh there was a

00:36:35.894,00:36:42.033
lock picking challenge. Uh
different from the lock picking
village, they had to lockpick

00:36:42.033,00:36:47.038
with uh paper clips. So so
CTF.SG actually take that so uh
probably uh second place

00:36:54.546,00:36:59.551
HaxWells are you around? Anyone?
No. >>Here! >>You’re here?
Where? Come on. Come over. Yeah

00:37:06.825,00:37:13.765
so I’m in. I'll just leave it to
them to describe the CTF. This
the- the first 3 places they

00:37:13.765,00:37:18.770
have been playing for all 3 days
straight. From morning at 10
until 6pm so yeah. Second place.

00:37:22.574,00:37:27.579
>>[crowd cheers] We had a lot of
fun. Uh we hacked some
bluetooth, we chugged some

00:37:34.319,00:37:38.890
beers, we stole some password
hashes. What else did we do?
>>Moved the crane. >>And that

00:37:38.890,00:37:44.629
was just breakfast downstairs,
right? >>We blacked out the
city, we moved the crane. Uh we

00:37:44.629,00:37:49.634
had a great time. Thank you guys
for the CTF. >>Yeah thank you.
>>Thank you. [applause] >>Next

00:37:54.606,00:37:59.611
uh I’ll get the first place
CTF.SG uh. [applause] It’s a
very large group. >>Yeah, that’s

00:38:11.256,00:38:14.359
a lot of uh tequila and
shotguns. [laughter] >>Hi guys.
Um it was uh it was pretty fun.

00:38:14.359,00:38:19.364
Uh I think 1 2 3 4 5 6 I mean so
many of us uh played since uh
the first day. I think some of

00:38:28.273,00:38:34.679
us even attended talks. Uh so-
but it was a good experience um
managed to turn off the city,

00:38:34.679,00:38:39.684
managed to um remotely trigger
some hydraulics to flash water,
so- and lockpicks, so I think

00:38:42.387,00:38:48.026
it’s pretty fun. And uh some of
us are actually here first time
at DEF CON so- >>Cool! >>Many of

00:38:48.026,00:38:54.899
us are coming back next year to
play the CTF again. >>Woohoo! >
Thank you. [applause]

00:38:54.899,00:39:00.672
>>Hopefully they play our CTF
again because last year is the
first places is so uh the same

00:39:00.672,00:39:05.677
team, I mean not the same people
but the same team. >>Is that it?
Is that all you got? >>That’s

00:39:11.816,00:39:16.821
it. >>Ok. [applause] >>Alright
SOHOpelessly Broken. Ahh. >>Ahh.
>>So go that way. >>They’re

00:39:31.236,00:39:34.672
taking selfies Heizenberg, give
‘em a break. Alright we told ‘em
they could do whatever they

00:39:34.672,00:39:40.211
want. [laughter] Don’t go back
on that now. >>Oh they’re doing
selfies. >>See we’re gonna take

00:39:40.211,00:39:47.151
a picture I- I dare you to say
something. I freaking dare you.
[laughter] >>Thank you. 1, 2, 3.

00:39:47.151,00:39:52.890
[laughter] >>Thank you.
>>Alright it’s all you.
>>Awesome, all me. >>All you.

00:39:52.890,00:39:57.929
>>These lights are a lot
brighter than the closing
ceremonies. Alright um wait

00:39:57.929,00:40:04.335
where’s the team that won? Get
on the stage! Come on, come on
come on come on. They’re gonna

00:40:04.335,00:40:10.375
yell at me any second now. Ok
so, yeah so SOHOpelessly Broken
CTF. Uh this year was really

00:40:10.375,00:40:16.614
crazy we had over 200 teams
register to play uh that’s like
teams 2 to 4 people. Uh this

00:40:16.614,00:40:21.519
teams uh quite a lot larger. Uh
so that was like you know
anywhere from like 600 to 1000

00:40:21.519,00:40:26.291
people I don’t know I wasn’t
counting. But so let’s see here
this is our first place team it

00:40:26.291,00:40:32.330
was really impressive because
they somehow got um 1 extra
point. Uh normally all our

00:40:32.330,00:40:37.135
scores are round numbers. Uh so
I want to give a call out to
everyone that participated

00:40:37.135,00:40:41.339
because we decided to give like
little gifts to the first top 5
teams ‘cause there were so many

00:40:41.339,00:40:46.344
players. Uh so in fifth uh we
had TeamRED [applause.] Uh then
we had in fourth uh 5Dimensions

00:40:52.917,00:40:57.922
[applause]. And then a personal
favorite uh name uh 418 I’m A
Teapot, pretty good for IOT

00:41:01.726,00:41:06.731
related stuff. Good job them.
[applause] Then flatboardman,
pretty good. >>Yeah >>[applause]

00:41:11.869,00:41:17.442
And without further delay this
team behind me, SIXGEN they did
a great job. Uh it’s amazing

00:41:17.442,00:41:22.647
because they pretty much had
almost every single device uh 1
of the devices was so finicky

00:41:22.647,00:41:27.352
that we decided to smash it with
a crowbar. So I guess that’s out
of the contest forever now. Um

00:41:27.352,00:41:31.422
I’m trying to think if there’s
anything else cool. Oh the rest
of my staff is packing up all

00:41:31.422,00:41:36.260
the devices, we had like over 50
boxes, so they’re not with me
but the team from last year that

00:41:36.260,00:41:41.632
won uh first place this year
we’ve been working a lot with
them to collaborate uh from here

00:41:41.632,00:41:47.138
to Canada. They’ve been
operating IOT village in Canada
and working on our CTF and we’ve

00:41:47.138,00:41:51.476
been collaborating on research.
So it’s really really cool so
I’m happy that they came out and

00:41:51.476,00:41:56.714
did a workshop with us so thank
you for everyone that has made
uh the SOHOpefully Broken CTF

00:41:56.714,00:42:01.652
awesome. And I hope you come
back and play next year.
[applause] >>Alright. Selfies?

00:42:06.024,00:42:11.029
Selfies? Selfies. [laughter]
Guys you aren’t in the slides!
[laughter] >>[conversation off

00:42:20.805,00:42:25.810
mic] >>Cool. Hey guys uh my name
is Jeff, I go by Morph here. I
represent Tamper Evident

00:42:29.013,00:42:33.985
Village. If you had to stop by,
uh you probably saw me talking
about some seals. Uh so I’m here

00:42:33.985,00:42:39.323
today to announce the
counterfeit badge contest uh
along with the king of the hill

00:42:39.323,00:42:44.328
winners. Uh so we’re gonna start
with the counterfeit badge
contest. [audience cheers] So

00:42:49.534,00:42:56.207
Gory and Gulo uh coming in in
first place. You may have heard
about this mythical badge uh

00:42:56.207,00:43:02.346
it’s pungent uh you smell it
before you see it. Um it was
fished out of a strip club. I’ll

00:43:02.346,00:43:07.985
let them take it away but coming
in first place at 24 out of 30
points uh with their counterfeit

00:43:07.985,00:43:14.792
urinal cake badge [laughter].
>>Everyone should ask Grifter
how it tastes later. >>It was

00:43:14.792,00:43:19.797
delicious. I’m not gonna lie. I
knew what it was, I still wanted
to taste it. [laughter] How many

00:43:24.469,00:43:29.674
of you have tasted a urinal
cake? Right you don’t go fishing
‘em out of there and taste it. I

00:43:29.674,00:43:34.679
like to experience new things.
Call me. [laughter] >>Alright so
Gary and I started our spirit

00:43:37.081,00:43:42.253
journey Friday night asking for
any assistance from anyone on
our spirit journey- >>Gawd you

00:43:42.253,00:43:46.257
can smell that thing over here.
>> And no one decided to help.
We were on the search for the

00:43:46.257,00:43:53.064
great rare Las Vegas Pee-ote.
>>Does anyone know how hard it
actually is to find a urinal

00:43:53.064,00:43:59.337
cake in Las Vegas? [laughter]
>>We were banned from several
strip clubs, bars, dive bars,

00:43:59.337,00:44:06.077
casinos, CVSs, Walgreens and
Albertsons because no 1 appeared
to like nitrile gloves and seran

00:44:06.077,00:44:11.782
wrap. [laughter] Really pissing
off a few strip club bouncers
before we met the

00:44:11.782,00:44:18.122
universe.[laughter] >>And then
we acquired the pee-ote.
[laughter] >>As our- >>Jesus

00:44:18.122,00:44:23.127
>>-um unlikely heroes or, as-
before the sun came up our
unlikely heroes discovered-

00:44:25.863,00:44:30.868
finally discovered the booty
they so desired. Does anyone
have a dremel? >>Woo! [cheers]

00:44:35.673,00:44:41.779
>>Yeah we get- we can smell it
from here that it’s a urinal
cake. >>You can smell it, it’s

00:44:41.779,00:44:46.984
bad! >>Uh coming in second place
was Molly uh she left this
morning on an airplane uh

00:44:46.984,00:44:52.156
counterfeit badge actually
really good, uh marble on the
front. It passed 6 goons with

00:44:52.156,00:44:58.396
full inspection, none of them
were the wiser. It feels bad. Um
and lastly was uh so with the

00:44:58.396,00:45:00.331
black badge uh we typically put
them in a separate category
cause these guys go crazy. Uh so

00:45:00.331,00:45:02.333
we’ve got 2 different categories
of entry the current year’s
badge and former year’s badge

00:45:02.333,00:45:07.338
and the black badge that these
guys replicated was so identical
to the actual black badge of

00:45:14.378,00:45:20.017
last year uh that if anybody
here knows Em and Charlie over
in the tamper village, it fooled

00:45:20.017,00:45:23.888
both of them uh and that’s a
real impressive feat. So I’m
gonna have them tell you a

00:45:23.888,00:45:28.893
little bit about the badge here.
>>So uh we won the SOHOpelessly
Broken last year and- and we

00:45:30.962,00:45:35.199
were awarded 1 badge for the 3
of us and so coming to DEF CON
we thought that just wasn’t

00:45:35.199,00:45:40.204
gonna- wasn’t gonna be you know
realistic. We needed to have all
3. So uh we spent the time,

00:45:40.204,00:45:45.509
we’ve never done any PCB work
before we uh spent hours with
micrometers measuring every

00:45:45.509,00:45:50.381
little piece, testing every
little component just to- to get
the traces right um trying to

00:45:50.381,00:45:53.918
figure out what the heck that
vacuum tube was ‘cause we’ve
never had- used vacuum tubes

00:45:53.918,00:45:59.090
before. Um finally the week
before DEFCON we got the third
iteration of our- of our PCB

00:45:59.090,00:46:04.996
shipped from PCB way and the
black was close but not exactly
perfect to the- to the real

00:46:04.996,00:46:09.667
black badge but we decided with
a week til DEF CON we had to
assemble it anyway. Uh we

00:46:09.667,00:46:13.237
ordered some pizza while we were
assembling, our hands were a
little greasy, it turns out the

00:46:13.237,00:46:17.541
pizza grease actually helped
convert that black to a- just
the perfect black to match the-

00:46:17.541,00:46:22.546
the real black badge. [applause]
>>Thank you. [applause]
>>Selfie? >>Grifter, selfie?

00:46:33.257,00:46:39.997
>>Source code review challenge.
>>Grifter, you cut us off! Also
not appearing in these slides.

00:46:39.997,00:46:44.068
>>Hey guys. Gator from DC
Darknet. How’s everybody doing
today? [crowd cheers] Alright!

00:46:44.068,00:46:49.740
So we got a few agents out there
that’s awesome. So if you guys
haven’t heard about DC Darknet,

00:46:49.740,00:46:53.678
it’s a real life MMO RPG. We
send you across all of DEF CON
to people to go through and

00:46:53.678,00:46:58.049
learn stuff from real people
when- and real experts in their
field. Come back and you level

00:46:58.049,00:47:01.452
up. So the awesome part is that
we were able to get together
with 10 different villages this

00:47:01.452,00:47:07.558
year and send you from all the
way over at the uh Planet
Hollywood all the way to

00:47:07.558,00:47:12.630
Flamingo. So without further
ado, Mentals gonna talk about
who first and second and third

00:47:12.630,00:47:17.635
place is. >>Cool so once again
we had another great year. Uh we
grew once again, we had hundreds

00:47:20.137,00:47:23.607
of returning players and
hundreds and hundreds and
hundreds of new players uh as

00:47:23.607,00:47:28.512
they came to our table in the
contest area they got to
experience a wonderful fragrance

00:47:28.512,00:47:33.417
from these lovely gentlemen as
they were working on their badge
at our table. Uh but it- it

00:47:33.417,00:47:37.455
turned out to another great
year. Uh our players
successfully shut down the march

00:47:37.455,00:47:42.059
hair and disconnected it from
CyberRes, moving our story
forward once again and and

00:47:42.059,00:47:48.199
carrying that forward. Uh we had
an interesting uh event in our
standings this year where our

00:47:48.199,00:47:54.238
3rd place wasn't present at
DEFCON at all. So
congratulations to Ax, that is

00:47:54.238,00:47:59.243
amazing. [crowd yells] Second
place was McLovin, stand up.
>>Stand up dude! [cheers] >>And

00:48:01.178,00:48:07.118
Sage Fault is Sage Fault here?
Well Sage Fault got first place.
So since you guys were so kind

00:48:07.118,00:48:12.189
as to give Sage Fault a DEFCON
badge- uh or a DEFCON entry
badge next year, we’re gonna

00:48:12.189,00:48:16.393
give second and third place
badges. So Dax when you watch
this, that means you have to get

00:48:16.393,00:48:22.867
your a*s here next year.
[cheers] Thank you, we’ll see
you guys next time! [applause]

00:48:22.867,00:48:28.172
>>Now source code review
challenge. >>First time speaker,
I’m looking forward to taking

00:48:28.172,00:48:33.310
care of this uh tradition here.
>>You got it. >>Alright cool. Um
yeah so uh it can’t be confirmed

00:48:33.310,00:48:38.315
or denied since the judges were
so drunk, my name is Hot Santa.
[crowd hoots and cheers] >>Nice.

00:48:41.185,00:48:46.423
>>Yeah so I’m uh Naz I’m with
the AdSec village. Uh we had a
couple contests. Uh 1 was a

00:48:46.423,00:48:52.863
secure code review challenge uh
a team built an application that
uh took data from NVD and LTVs

00:48:52.863,00:48:58.202
uh and produced questions uh
with actual git commits from
confirmed vulnerabilities. Uh so

00:48:58.202,00:49:03.140
we had uh we had 80 peel- people
sign up to uh to join the
contest. We had about half

00:49:03.140,00:49:08.145
participate. Uh we had uh a
total of uh over 4000 questions
were asked uh and uh, and so we

00:49:10.981,00:49:15.486
had 3 winners we have astro,
Li-Wey Lu, and icernica. Uh if
you guys are here you wanna come

00:49:15.486,00:49:20.491
up. [applause] Thanks guys.
Alright. [applause] >>Is, oh.
Threat modelling

00:49:31.402,00:49:36.407
challenge.[audience murmurs]
What just happened over there?
>>Somebody - >>You guys do your

00:49:46.183,00:49:51.155
thing, you’re fine. Threat
modeling? >>Yeah he’s right
behind you. >>Where? Oh you son

00:49:51.155,00:49:56.961
of a b*tch. [laughter] Hot santa
again? >>Yeah hot santa! >>Hot
santa! >>It’s actually Saint

00:49:56.961,00:50:00.998
Nick but it’s alright. Uh yeah
so uh the other challenge we had
was uh threat modeling

00:50:00.998,00:50:06.003
challenge. Uh so uh we we
basically put together a
vulnerable design uh for a fake

00:50:06.003,00:50:10.040
company for a basically it was
food ordering. We had a kiosk,
we had a printer, uh there was

00:50:10.040,00:50:16.714
some back end services. Uh we
had about 60 people sign up, 45
teams uh some and uh we

00:50:16.714,00:50:20.651
basically went through, reviewed
the threat models trying to find
uh uh threat identification you

00:50:20.651,00:50:25.422
know so a high number of threats
were identified that were
actionable uh and- and well

00:50:25.422,00:50:30.427
documented for the- for Dev
team. Uh and so we had uh 2
winners. Uh we had uh this was a

00:50:30.427,00:50:35.699
team based 1 to 3 uh team
members uh so first place was uh
Seanner uh if you want to come

00:50:35.699,00:50:41.739
up and uh- and then we had uh
second place uh was uh team
BiOSec uh was uh Jolene, Dickie,

00:50:41.739,00:50:46.744
and I’m not gonna pronounce it,
A O X T C. So thanks. [applause]
>>You dropped stuff. You dropped

00:50:55.853,00:51:00.791
it. >>I’ve got Hot Santa’s hotel
room key. [audience laughs]
>>That’s hot. [laughter] >>You

00:51:06.196,00:51:11.201

the next contest too, who knows.
[laughter] No, you’re not.

00:51:13.771,00:51:18.776
Alright, uh Gold Bug. >>Woo!
[laughter] >>That’s not
alphabetical at all. >>That’s

00:51:21.512,00:51:25.649
not at all. [laughter] >>It’s
“the”. >>Yeah I guess “the”. >>I
failed. >>It’s super bright up

00:51:25.649,00:51:28.953
here. Uh we’re the Gold Bug
puzzle, we’re part of the crypto
privacy village. It’s a crypt-

00:51:28.953,00:51:32.056
cryptography based puzzle hunt
if you’re familiar with the
concept of puzzle hunts. And

00:51:32.056,00:51:35.659
it’s the fourth year that we did
the contest. Um we also have a
ton of puzzles for junior

00:51:35.659,00:51:39.396
cryptographers, uh newbs or kids
who wanna come by and that-that
had a lot of success this year.

00:51:39.396,00:51:43.334
Um do you wanna talk about how
many people entered and-? >>Yeah
so this year we had a really

00:51:43.334,00:51:49.206
good show out. We had 275 teams
register so those are people
that we convinced to connect to

00:51:49.206,00:51:55.145
the WiFi because the BBS isn’t
very mobile friendly right now.
To do for next year. Uh with

00:51:55.145,00:52:00.084
those 275 teams we had 2303
wrong answers submitted and 26-
27 correct answers submitted.

00:52:04.121,00:52:10.327
The team that won solved 8 of
our 9 challenges, so that means
1 of them remains to be solved-

00:52:10.327,00:52:14.698
>>Unsolved, yeah. >>Uh after
Con. Goodluck. Um all the
puzzles are still available and

00:52:14.698,00:52:20.471
will be av- available after the
conference at uh Gold Bug dot
crypto village dot org so- so

00:52:20.471,00:52:26.643
keep up the hard work. >>Uh team
Gold Bugs if you’re here come on
up. Um I can’t see anything. Um

00:52:26.643,00:52:29.613
and uh what was aw- really
awesome about- yeah there you
go! What was really awesome

00:52:29.613,00:52:33.617
about Gold Bugs is that they
said that they tried to do the
contest the first year and they

00:52:33.617,00:52:37.688
said “I really want to win this
contest!” and this year they got
to win it so that’s awesome to

00:52:37.688,00:52:42.693
see them- to see them do that.
[applause]. And um if you like
cryptography and puzzles like-

00:52:46.563,00:52:50.534
like- um like we just said,
check us out on, check out the
BBS it’s still online. Follow us

00:52:50.534,00:52:55.539
on Twitter and join the puzzle
next year. >>Yeah. >>Thank you!
>>Thanks! [applause] >>Tin foil

00:53:07.051,00:53:12.056
hat. >>Woo! [applause] >>Yeah So
Tin Foil Hat uh people may have
seen uh various people walking

00:53:16.260,00:53:21.432
around DEFCON uh wearing uh tin
foil hats on their head. That’s
really the whole point of the

00:53:21.432,00:53:28.238
contest is to get people to be
silly and you know build the tin
foil hat. We do some uh you know

00:53:28.238,00:53:33.010
SDR testing to see actually how
well they- they do to like block
the sign- signal and attenuate

00:53:33.010,00:53:39.516
it. Um but you know the heart of
it is seeing the really stupid
crazy tin foil hats. Uh this

00:53:39.516,00:53:46.156
year’s uh winner actually uh she
won it the first year and then
she came back the uh third year

00:53:46.156,00:53:51.161
here and made a replica of the
James Webb space telescope and
was walking around with that. Uh

00:53:53.263,00:53:58.268
the uh second place winner uh-
of- for the style and substance
uh was a little girl uh what was

00:54:01.738,00:54:06.743
her name it is Nova King. Uh she
actually didn’t uh- we weren't
able to get her her prizes so if

00:54:08.745,00:54:13.884
uh she sees this or is still
around DEFCON please contact me
and then we’ll get you your

00:54:13.884,00:54:18.889
prize. So that’s all I have and
let’s get some of this selfie
action here. [applause] >>Not

00:54:23.026,00:54:28.031
the crowd not the crowd. Get in
here. Come on hurry. >>Um that
is a black page. Alright

00:54:42.146,00:54:47.151
wireless CTF. No. Alright so um
thanks everybody um- >>Nope wait
wait wait! >>What? >>Schemaverse

00:54:54.958,00:54:59.963
>>Oh that’s right. Sorry uh you
didn't send us your results so
we’re judging you harshly. But

00:55:03.567,00:55:08.572
come up and tell us about the
Schemaverse. >>[unclear off mic]
>>So as pointed out I’m an idiot

00:55:13.677,00:55:18.382
and didn’t submit results. So
thank you. We wanted to keep it
a secret for the winner. Uh

00:55:18.382,00:55:22.052
Schemaverse is everyone’s
favorite space based battle game
built inside a postgres

00:55:22.052,00:55:26.790
database.[chuckles from the
crowd] Not a lot of them, so.
>>That’s all it is. >>It works

00:55:26.790,00:55:32.896
out. [laughter] Um basically our
users don’t sit there writing
SQL all day long, instead they

00:55:32.896,00:55:37.601
create bots that play the game
on their behalf while they go
and get sh*t faced. Um and I

00:55:37.601,00:55:43.574
think- >>Yeah! >>The best
example of that is the fact that
the winner actually f*cked up

00:55:43.574,00:55:49.112
early game allowing 1 of our
other very high s- highly
skilled players to get a very

00:55:49.112,00:55:55.953
very big advantage uh while he
was also off enjoying Shabba
Con. So he had no f*cking idea

00:55:55.953,00:56:00.891
what was going on but he was
doing really really good. Uh but
our winner did come from behind

00:56:02.960,00:56:09.032
and Sisfix is the champion,
reigning, again. Second year,
third year in a row. Either way

00:56:09.032,00:56:16.006
congratulations. Second place
was Mr. Glass, third place was
Black Cat Hacker. Um

00:56:16.006,00:56:22.112
Schemeaverse dot com does run
all year round so if you do feel
like writing way too much SQL I

00:56:22.112,00:56:26.383
invite you to come check it out.
Uh the next contest is Coin
Droids, cause we also didn’t

00:56:26.383,00:56:31.388
submit the results for that.
Thank you. [applause] >>I’m not
Coin Droids, I’m command and

00:56:38.862,00:56:43.467
control, but I also didn’t
submit my stuff. >>They didn’t
submit it either. What’s going

00:56:43.467,00:56:48.071
on around here? >>It turns out
you gotta read those emails and
I just totally failed. >>Yeah.

00:56:48.071,00:56:52.976
No shit. >>But um so Command and
Control is a hacking challenge
for web and mobile. And uh holy

00:56:52.976,00:56:56.280
sh*t this is super bright. I
like- everybody comments on it
but like I can’t like see

00:56:56.280,00:57:02.286
anything. Um so this year we had
about 140 challenges to
discover, uh we had over 200

00:57:02.286,00:57:07.591
teams and players play; and uh
but the top 3 teams were like
absolutely head and shoulders

00:57:07.591,00:57:13.930
over everybody else um and in
third place we had uh- a team
BaHumbug they play every year um

00:57:13.930,00:57:18.935
with uh 3250 points. Um uh uh a
repeat player 8 Bit Brandon got
second place, and Savage

00:57:23.040,00:57:28.045
Submarine got first place this
year. Uh so nice work! Um Savage
Submarine uh found about 90

00:57:30.447,00:57:34.217
percent of the overall
vulnerabilities, that’s pretty
huge. Um and then next year

00:57:34.217,00:57:38.255
we’re gonna be launching 2
totally new vulnerable sites, uh
all cloud based and stuff like

00:57:38.255,00:57:43.260
that so uh yeah, nice work guys.
[applause] >>Selfie? >>Take your
selfie! >>Yeah get over here.

00:57:50.534,00:57:56.973
You got your phone. >>Coin
Droids are you coming up here or
not? >>Here. We’re right here.

00:57:56.973,00:58:01.611
>>Are you coming up here or not?
>>Yeah yeah. >>You gotta ignore
the selfies. I thought we

00:58:01.611,00:58:05.882
established this. Ignore them,
they don’t exist. >>I go my
whole life ignoring selfies,

00:58:05.882,00:58:10.887
trust me, that’s not a problem.
Uh so Coin Droids. Um this is
our sixth year um we are a block

00:58:14.691,00:58:21.264
chain based battle game where
robots throw coins at each other
and kill each other. Um so we’ve

00:58:21.264,00:58:26.269
had uh double the amount of
active users, daily active users
this year, which is like 15. No

00:58:28.505,00:58:33.510
no it’s like um so our first
place goes to Ball Hair. Um
[laughter] >>Ball hair. >>You

00:58:37.114,00:58:41.284
know it’s about time ball hair
got something. >>Got a chance,
right? >>You know? >>Honestly

00:58:41.284,00:58:45.188
ball hair gets cut off way too
often. >>Yeah constantly.
>>Never appreciated. >>Let’s

00:58:45.188,00:58:49.192
bring, no I don’t want to bring
Ball Hair on stage, I like
everyone else. [laughter] >>We

00:58:49.192,00:58:52.896
appreciate it. [laughter] >>Um-
>>[audience member asking
question] >>That’s what he’s

00:58:52.896,00:58:57.100
saying. >>I’m saying Ball Hair
doesn’t get the recognition that
they- that it deserves. >>That

00:58:57.100,00:58:59.870
it needs. >>Including today. I’m
not calling ball hair on stage.
>>Let’s talk about your

00:58:59.870,00:59:03.807
manscaping habits. [laughter]
You taking care of your bits?
>>Uh second place was

00:59:03.807,00:59:08.812
manscaping. Ah no [laughter] no.
[laughter] Uh so BallHair won
with uh 600- uh 942 kills and

00:59:12.115,00:59:17.554
won 76 Defcoin which is worth
absolutely nothing so
congratulations.[laughter] Uh

00:59:17.554,00:59:22.559
second place was DeathMachine
with 413 kills and won 66 point
6 Defcoin so Hail Satan right.

00:59:26.363,00:59:31.368
Um altogether there were uh 7041
Defcoin transactions uh related
to coindriods uh out of a total

00:59:36.373,00:59:42.612
of 9277 Defcoin transactions
during the conference. Um which
is 76 percent of all Defcoin

00:59:42.612,00:59:48.418
transactions which means there
are 2236 Defcoin transactions
that are not related to Coin

00:59:48.418,00:59:52.522
Droids which means people are
using it for some reason which
doesn't make any sense. So

00:59:52.522,00:59:56.827
whatever the f*ck you’re doing
with it, congratulations. Uh.
>>We’re gonna tell you later,

00:59:56.827,01:00:02.332
you’re gonna freak out.
[laughter] >>So uh Ball Hair uh
