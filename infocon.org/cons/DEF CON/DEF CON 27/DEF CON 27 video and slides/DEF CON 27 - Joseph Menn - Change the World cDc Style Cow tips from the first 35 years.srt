00:00:00.167,00:00:05.172
>>Alright everyone. Might as
well get started on time here.
Welcome to the cDc panel!

00:00:05.172,00:00:10.177
[applause] Time for me to go
away! >>Is anybody out there who
was here uh 20 years ago at

00:00:16.350,00:00:21.922
DEFCON 7, might have seen these
guys, show of hands? >>Raise
your hand. [crowd cheers] >>I

00:00:21.922,00:00:26.393
saw them, they were awesome!
>>Yeah they were great. You
should listen to those dudes.

00:00:26.393,00:00:31.398
>>Alright this is like the 727
like DEFCON 7, DEFCON 27- >>As
long as we’re not the 737 Max I

00:00:34.368,00:00:39.373
think we’ll be okay. >>[laughs]
Um so uh thanks for showing up.
Um I’m really excited about this

00:00:41.808,00:00:46.813
um this is the the largest cDc
assemblage on a panel uh in- >>a
long time. >>Close to 20 years.

00:00:50.050,00:00:56.356
Um. [cheers from crowd] Uh so-
>>I miss you guys! >>[laughs]
Just briefly introducing folks

00:00:56.356,00:01:01.762
here, I mean you can read the
bios and stuff um I’m Joe Menn
I’m a reporter uh and I wrote a

00:01:01.762,00:01:07.968
book about these guys um which I
hope you read. Uh this is Deth
Veggie um Luke Benfey is his

00:01:07.968,00:01:14.408
actual name. >>Oh God! [cheers]
>>Uh minister of propaganda uh
of Cult of the Dead Cow and he’s

00:01:14.408,00:01:19.413
got like a regular security job,
uh too. Uh next is M- is uh
Omega. [cheers] >>The allusive.

00:01:26.219,00:01:30.857
>>This- he says this is his
first hacker con in- in close to
20 years so show him some love

00:01:30.857,00:01:35.862
please. [applause] >>Thank you,
thank you. >>Aww! >>Aww! >>So if
you if you read cDc text files

00:01:39.366,00:01:43.270
once upon a time or more
recently, the odds are pretty
good that Misha w- edited the-

00:01:43.270,00:01:47.908
them and he also um invented the
word hacktivism which uh
continues to resonate today.

00:01:47.908,00:01:52.145
>>And if you’re a fan of the- of
the 6 million dollar man. >>Oh
yeah! >>Big file. >>Uh and the

00:01:52.145,00:01:57.150
clean, the clean cut looking
gentlemen is some dude named
Mudge, um [chuckles] Ummm.

00:02:02.756,00:02:07.761
[applause] Living- living legend
uh former uh Darpa cyber
security czar um and a whole

00:02:11.264,00:02:15.335
bunch of other stuff. Frequent
keynote speaker here and just
all around inspiration, inventor

00:02:15.335,00:02:20.340
of the cyber fast track at Darpa
which gave like government money
to people like you to go find

00:02:22.442,00:02:29.282
cool shit. [laughs] [crowd
whistles] Um and and uh and then
finally Chris Rioux uh Dildog uh

00:02:29.282,00:02:34.287
the the man who wrote BO2K
released here 20 years ago.
[crowd cheers] >>Thanks. >>Um

00:02:39.593,00:02:44.598
more recently birthed some
unicorn called Veracode. Um
which was that was his company.

00:02:55.409,00:02:57.411
So uh if they were most famous
20 years ago, why would I write
a book why you know about them

00:02:57.411,00:02:59.413
now? Why would we all be
gathered here today? Um uh it’s
a good question. There actually

00:02:59.413,00:03:03.250
there are 3 reasons. 1 is um
they’re still around today and
they go back to the mid 80’s, so

00:03:03.250,00:03:08.855
it’s uh they are a skeleton key
for like all of the the major
turns in infosec and hacking

00:03:08.855,00:03:12.659
through that time. Eh you don’t
have to go back and read 30
years worth of usenet posts, you

00:03:12.659,00:03:16.963
can if you want to, but you
don’t have to to get the you
know the essence of the major

00:03:16.963,00:03:23.437
leaps forward um in infosec.
That’s 1 reason. Uh the second
reason is my last book was

00:03:23.437,00:03:27.541
depressing as h*ll. Um it was
called Fatal System Error, and
it was about basically how we’re

00:03:27.541,00:03:31.812
all screwed because security is
hopeless and the Russians hate
us and they don’t care about

00:03:31.812,00:03:35.949
crime and all this other stuff.
All of which is still true, um,
I don’t want to give you the

00:03:35.949,00:03:39.619
idea that we’re not screwed.
>>No, no, the Kremlin dislikes
us. The Russians are fine

00:03:39.619,00:03:44.624
people. >>Russians are fine
folks. Um but it was you know it
was a downer. Umm and um you

00:03:46.827,00:03:50.564
know if I only got to write 1
book on cyber security I would
probably write a downer, I would

00:03:50.564,00:03:54.367
say hey we’re basically screwed.
But I get to write 2, it turns
out; I lived long enough to

00:03:54.367,00:03:58.839
write another 1. Um and I wanted
to do something positive, so I’m
thinking so here’s something

00:03:58.839,00:04:04.811
that works uh here’s something
that’s worth emulating um and
and worth trying. Um and the

00:04:04.811,00:04:09.816
third reason is that cDc has I
think at least 3 key qualities
that are are really really

00:04:12.419,00:04:16.223
important uh that I want to get
out there into the world, p-
particularly to folks that

00:04:16.223,00:04:21.595
weren’t around back in the day.
The most important is critical
thinking. I- I feel like we’re

00:04:21.595,00:04:26.299
like have a worldwide crisis in
the lack of critical thinking.
We have people who believe that

00:04:26.299,00:04:32.239
the world is flat, um [crowd
laughs]. And I don’t think we’re
gonna get you know the

00:04:32.239,00:04:36.343
Department of Education to
parachute philosophy professors
into school districts around the

00:04:36.343,00:04:42.115
country to teach them critical
thinking, um so we have to find
some other way of celebrating uh

00:04:42.115,00:04:47.621
and holding uh this quality up.
And all good hackers are by
definition critical thinkers you

00:04:47.621,00:04:50.457
know. Because- you’re looking at
a system and you’re trying to
you know you’re trying to make

00:04:50.457,00:04:55.328
it do something it wasn’t
designed to do uh to see if that
works. Um and we need that in

00:04:55.328,00:05:01.802
all in all walks of life more
than ever right now. The second
is they had 1 or more moral

00:05:01.802,00:05:08.175
causes driving them. It varied
over the years, it varied based
on the individual. Uh pursuit of

00:05:08.175,00:05:14.281
knowledge, spreading of
knowledge, human rights, uh
there are many moral causes and

00:05:14.281,00:05:18.852
I think that’s really
fundamental and is also getting
lost today. Um and- and the

00:05:18.852,00:05:24.891
third uh the third thing is that
they’re adaptable. They the cDc
morphed so many times. It

00:05:24.891,00:05:31.164
started you know, bulletin board
operators, text files that were
funny, sometimes obscene, um

00:05:31.164,00:05:35.101
some written by presidential
candidates. [laughter] >>Some
that were spoken word. >>Um and

00:05:35.101,00:05:40.340
um and then and you know and
then there was like the the sort
of tech influx and they managed

00:05:40.340,00:05:45.412
to slap Microsoft around until
uh they got at this court
certified monopoly to take

00:05:45.412,00:05:50.884
security more seriously. Uh and
then they did uh amazing things
since then in the in public

00:05:50.884,00:05:57.157
sector, much in others uh
private sector, Dildog in
others, and keeping the the the

00:05:57.157,00:06:02.062
idea of hacktivism uh alive in
the private sector, and excuse
me, the non profit sector and

00:06:02.062,00:06:08.001
and uh your garden variety uh
activism. Uh and they they’ve
done all of those amazing

00:06:08.001,00:06:13.006
things. So I- I think as stuff
gets weirder and harder in this
world uh the ability to adapt,

00:06:15.408,00:06:19.112
the ability to say well I know
this thing I’m going to keep
these values, I’m going to try

00:06:19.112,00:06:23.683
this totally new terrain. Learn
how to mess with the media,
learn how to talk to Congress, I

00:06:23.683,00:06:27.921
think that’s essential now uh as
we’re dealing with info ops and
all this other stuff. That none

00:06:27.921,00:06:31.791
of us have a background in. I
think it’s really important to
be able to do that. So without

00:06:31.791,00:06:36.296
further ado, I want to sort of
go through the chronologic-
chron- chronology here

00:06:36.296,00:06:40.367
reasonably quickly um so I can
have Q and A at the end. And I
want to talk about- have

00:06:40.367,00:06:47.340
everybody talk about, you know,
a way forward when we’re done.
So um to start off with uh with

00:06:47.340,00:06:53.079
uh Luke here. Veggie uh give us
a little bit of the history,
Lubbock you know where did cDc

00:06:53.079,00:06:57.984
come from and when did you run
into it? >>Uh well Cult of the
Dead Cow uh came out of uh

00:06:57.984,00:07:02.055
Lubbock Texas in the mid 80’s it
was founded by [crowd cheering]
woo hoo! [applause]. >>More into

00:07:02.055,00:07:07.027
the mic. >>Ca- [chuckles] More
into the mic? Came in- came out
of Lubbock Texas in the- in the

00:07:07.027,00:07:13.466
mid 80’s, it was founded by uh 3
punk kids Swamp Ratte’, Franken
Gibe and uh the allusive Sid

00:07:13.466,00:07:18.338
Vicious. Um uh Sid Vicious was
only temporary involved with it
and then his parents took his

00:07:18.338,00:07:23.343
modem away. [laughter] Um but uh
you know the the the other guys
started to you know spread it

00:07:25.712,00:07:29.983
around bulletin boards around
Texas and then further out
publishing text files with uh

00:07:29.983,00:07:35.555
developing a network of- of
other BBSs that would uh would
uh sort of publish and release

00:07:35.555,00:07:40.860
cDc files because they framed it
as uh you know “You get to
release cDc files! We’ll put you

00:07:40.860,00:07:44.597
in, you know, we- you’ll be a
member of the K Cow force! And
being a member of the K Cow

00:07:44.597,00:07:48.001
Force means you’re allowed to
release cDc files!” And people
were like Oh yeah I want to be

00:07:48.001,00:07:54.741
allowed to release cDc files!
Yeah! Exactly. So um as I say
started in Texas, but by the uh

00:07:54.741,00:08:01.514
by the late 80’s had started,
has- had spread much further. Uh
I grew up outside of Boston um

00:08:01.514,00:08:08.121
I- [crowd whoops] woo! I’d been
uh, I’d been exposed to cDc
through uh through their text

00:08:08.121,00:08:13.626
files um as far back as 87 um so
they were you know- they were a
group I was aware of. And and

00:08:13.626,00:08:18.631
and looked up to, I started to
talk to- to various members on
BBSs then I started to allegedly

00:08:20.867,00:08:27.774
set up hypothetically illegal
phone systems to talk to them
and so that they could talk to

00:08:27.774,00:08:32.779
each other and eventually I was
invited to join. [laughter] Um
and and you know that was in 91

00:08:35.181,00:08:39.152
I believe. >>[unclear] >>Yeah
these are my people. [crowd
cheers] >>Yeah. Uh and so uh you

00:08:39.152,00:08:45.759
know after that you know so I
would say that I think it’s
probably to say that I was part

00:08:45.759,00:08:49.596
of the sort of the second
generation of the cDc after the
the really early members

00:08:49.596,00:08:55.869
including uh uh Obscure Images
who’s here. Um uh today.
[applause] Uh had to sort of

00:08:55.869,00:09:02.342
really blaze- blaze the trail um
so uh you know from the very
beginning I looked up to cDc and

00:09:02.342,00:09:07.914
I I’m still immensely proud to
to be a part of it. [crowd
cheers] >>Awesome [applause]

00:09:07.914,00:09:12.919
>>So I just w- I just want to
say that among the that first
generation also is this Beto

00:09:15.188,00:09:20.493
O’Rourke guy- >>Psychedelic
Warlord! >>Yeah >>Psychedelic
Warlord 2020, Make America K Rad

00:09:20.493,00:09:27.500
again! [laughter] >>And uh and
uh Kevin Kevin Wheeler um I
don’t know if you- >>Swamp

00:09:27.500,00:09:30.570
Ratte’, yeah. >>The the the
name- >>Sorry, sorry,
Grandmaster Ratte’.

00:09:30.570,00:09:36.576
>>Grandmaster Ratte’. >>He was
promoted. >>[laughs] Um so yeah
so that’s that’s the beginnings

00:09:36.576,00:09:43.149
in Texas. Um another very key
early member um is Jesse- Jesse
Dryden. Um. >>Mr. Drunkfux.

00:09:43.149,00:09:49.689
>>Yeah we can we’re we’re we’re
at DEFCON we can say his handle
it’s Drunkfux. Um uh so he

00:09:49.689,00:09:56.529
started uh HoHoCon which was the
first hacking convention to
bring in um to invite the press

00:09:56.529,00:10:01.501
and and the cops so they didn’t
have to go to the trouble of uh
pretending to be hackers and uh

00:10:01.501,00:10:07.941
secretly like trying to recruit
snitches and and bust people. Um
uh so uh when Misha you you went

00:10:07.941,00:10:12.946
to uh you went to early HoHoCons
um so did Jeff Moss some guy he
got some ideas from there I-

00:10:15.448,00:10:22.055
I’ve heard. Um [applause] So uh
take us back to early HoHoCons,
what the, what- what was the

00:10:22.055,00:10:26.593
significance of getting together
in person? With all these people
you only knew on BBSs? >>Sure so

00:10:26.593,00:10:32.665
um the the first hacker
conventions were like Summer Con
and they were uh invite only so

00:10:32.665,00:10:37.670
if you happened to be users on
privileged BBSs that particip-
that that uh participated in um

00:10:41.307,00:10:46.746
uh Summer Con you would find out
about the invite. It would be in
St. Louis um in during some

00:10:46.746,00:10:51.684
summer months when school was
out, and uh- >>Possibly at the
same time as uh as a swinger

00:10:51.684,00:10:54.387
convention. >>Uh the- that’s a
different story. Um. [laughter]
Yes. There’s a there is a

00:10:54.387,00:10:59.526
swingers convention in St. Louis
as well. Um anyways so so there-
>>Several of us were really

00:10:59.526,00:11:04.364
confused when we showed up at
some of these early conventions
going “Is this what hacking is?”

00:11:04.364,00:11:08.034
>>And hijinks ensued! [laughter]
>>There- so the original hacking
conventions were were invite

00:11:08.034,00:11:12.572
only right so these were private
affairs uh hackers were gonna
talk amongst themselves and of

00:11:12.572,00:11:17.143
course they wouldn’t want
journalists or certainly law
enforcement there to record

00:11:17.143,00:11:21.080
everything that was going on
even though they probably were
there from the very beginning.

00:11:21.080,00:11:26.085
Um when Drunkfux started HoHoCon
um he he the his first uh
attempt at HoHoCon was also

00:11:29.856,00:11:34.861
invite only um but then somebody
found out about it um and they
let the um Howard Johnson’s know

00:11:37.530,00:11:42.368
that there was gonna be a bunch
of hackers descending over
Christmastime uh at their hotel

00:11:42.368,00:11:48.908
and Howard Johnson’s had a fit
about this and they cancelled
the contract and so um uh and

00:11:48.908,00:11:53.212
and it became public that there
was gonna be a bunch of hackers
somewhere in Houston over the

00:11:53.212,00:11:59.953
summer- the Christmas vacation.
And uh Drunkfux famously sent
out this message to uh on BBS

00:11:59.953,00:12:04.891
cDc BBSs saying HoJo’s says no
no to Ho Ho. [laughter] Um. And
so kind of out of that he said,

00:12:07.393,00:12:11.464
he said screw it, why don’t-
let’s- we’re gonna have another
convention somewhere else. We’ll

00:12:11.464,00:12:17.670
find some other hotel to go to.
Um and this time we’ll just
invite uh law enforcement and

00:12:17.670,00:12:21.507
we’ll invite the FBI and we’ll
invite journalists. Maybe
they’ll show up, maybe they

00:12:21.507,00:12:28.047
won’t. Um and uh so this was the
what the 1 of the first hacker
conventions that was sort of

00:12:28.047,00:12:34.687
open to the public. And many of
the things that people uh take
for granted uh as features of

00:12:34.687,00:12:39.926
DEFCON and Black Hat were ac-
were actually pioneered at
HoHoCon. So the uh spot the fed.

00:12:39.926,00:12:43.730
Why would you spot the fed?
Because we’re inviting them to
this convention and they’re

00:12:43.730,00:12:49.602
trying to fit in. Um they’re the
ones with the crew cuts and
they’re burly looking and they

00:12:49.602,00:12:55.308
look uncomfortable being there
and it’s easy to spot them,
right? So HoHoCon invented the

00:12:55.308,00:13:00.246
spot the fed contest. Um they
invented um selling T hacker T
shirts in order to recoup costs

00:13:03.249,00:13:07.587
for the convention. That was a
big, so swag. >>Merchandising,
merchandising! Merchandising!

00:13:07.587,00:13:13.159
>>Merchandising. Was a big
thing. Um capture the flag was
something else uh also pioneered

00:13:13.159,00:13:18.164
at HoHoCon. And so these this
this HoHoCon was is um um kind
of critical in in computer

00:13:20.400,00:13:25.672
security history for pioneering
all these- these things sort of
incidentally uh that that have

00:13:25.672,00:13:31.678
become staples of security
conventions generally or Black
Hat and DEFCON specifically now.

00:13:31.678,00:13:36.916
>>So I’ll also- like a couple
other quick things on that 1 is
that Texas is kinda big. And um

00:13:36.916,00:13:42.188
it you know in Boston or New
York hackers could get together
uh more easily. So you sort of

00:13:42.188,00:13:47.527
you you needed like an organized
event to get people there. And I
think um the personal

00:13:47.527,00:13:52.799
relationships that developed
that you can only do in person
um instead of just online make

00:13:52.799,00:13:57.170
made a big difference in sort of
the cDcs trajectory. Um you
could actually trust each other.

00:13:57.170,00:14:01.874
>>You’re right. Right. >>Which
has not been true of many other
hackers. >>And that was 1 of the

00:14:01.874,00:14:06.079
effects of of Summer Con um in-
in that you got to meet Taren
King, Knight Lightning, all

00:14:06.079,00:14:10.083
these hackers that you looked up
to who were who were on BBSs
that you called. But again it

00:14:10.083,00:14:15.788
was very it was invite only it
was a very very small select um
elite if you will group. Uh the

00:14:15.788,00:14:21.661
number of people who attended
SummerCon was like less than 50.
Maybe 50 people. Um and then at

00:14:21.661,00:14:23.663
at um HoHoCon um it it was again
open to the public, it started
out with you know a l- maybe

00:14:23.663,00:14:25.665
more than 50 people and then
grew and grew and grew. Um but
it but it for for cDc um it was

00:14:25.665,00:14:30.670
the first um pl- time that that
most of us could meet each
other. Right so I- I was living

00:14:39.312,00:14:44.217
in Boston and I knew the Boston
crew, I knew the- the folks who
would later um the Boston people

00:14:44.217,00:14:49.722
who would later join uh uh uh be
inducted into cDc. The people
who would later form the L0pht,

00:14:49.722,00:14:55.328
but I that’s all I knew. I
didn’t know this- the cDc people
in Texas, I didn’t know them in

00:14:55.328,00:15:00.867
uh Wisconsin, Chicago, I didn’t
know them anywhere else. And so
when Drunkfux put on HoHoCon

00:15:00.867,00:15:05.071
this was an opportunity not just
to meet other hackers that- that
I looked up to but it was an

00:15:05.071,00:15:09.675
opportunity to meet other
hackers in cDc, uh other other
people in cDc that that I had

00:15:09.675,00:15:13.246
looked up to or that I had
communicated with but n- had
never ever met. So that that was

00:15:13.246,00:15:18.785
important to us as well. >>I can
say you know for me it was again
the as you say it’s like you’re

00:15:18.785,00:15:21.721
meeting your friends for the
first time, you’re meeting the
face behind the monitor. And

00:15:21.721,00:15:26.826
especially back then that was a
really big deal. >>So uh-
another thing that that makes

00:15:26.826,00:15:30.630
cDc different from other groups
of the time and you know cDc
wasn’t the first it’s just you

00:15:30.630,00:15:35.301
know it’s the survivor of them
all. Some of the others were
were more, most of them in the

00:15:35.301,00:15:39.138
beginning were more technical.
Right? You - people who were
actually breaking into stuff a

00:15:39.138,00:15:45.645
lot and and writing about it on
on on bulletin boards perhaps
unwisely. Um whereas cDc it sort

00:15:45.645,00:15:48.981
of came out as like the liberal
arts wing of the hacker
underground you know started

00:15:48.981,00:15:53.920
with the text files. And not
everybody was an engineer or a
future engineer. You know uh

00:15:53.920,00:16:00.426
some people were more about the
you know social issues or the
writing itself um and and I

00:16:00.426,00:16:05.431
think that actually allowed cDc
to survive when others would get
rounded up from time to time. Um

00:16:07.767,00:16:14.373
so Mudge um tell us a little bit
uh about the L0pht. Um. And
before I before I- you go there

00:16:14.373,00:16:18.244
for those of you who don’t know
there’s- there’s substantial
overlap between the L0pht um

00:16:18.244,00:16:24.483
which I assume you all know
about uh and cDc uh 4 members um
lifetime that were were in both

00:16:24.483,00:16:30.890
including the 2 gents at the end
there. Uh L0pht by Nearing
hacker space told Congress what

00:16:30.890,00:16:35.895
was what in 1998, thank you for
that. Um uh but the L0pht and
cDc had an interesting dynamic.

00:16:38.164,00:16:42.368
Uh which we’ll get to in a
little bit. So bring uh educate
folks on uh a little bit about

00:16:42.368,00:16:49.208
the L0pht and how you came, came
into it. >>Sure so um cDc when
they asked me to join uh I was

00:16:49.208,00:16:53.246
already in the L0pht uh I
believe at the time. And what
was interesting is they were

00:16:53.246,00:16:58.818
making this transition from
being a bit more of the sort of
I’m I mean we’ve always been

00:16:58.818,00:17:04.557
like the the crown jesters of of
but they- they wanted a bit more
of a technical sort of presence

00:17:04.557,00:17:10.229
uh as they saw the field moving.
Uh and this sort of hand off to
it and they said well uh do you

00:17:10.229,00:17:15.067
have any you know like
advisories or security you know
write ups that you could you

00:17:15.067,00:17:20.072
know get- contribute to us that
would you know move us in this
particular direction. Uh at the

00:17:20.072,00:17:24.777
time it was 1 on uh ASCII uh
that I did and I was like, of
course I mean I I was huge fans

00:17:24.777,00:17:28.714
and uh Omega and White Knight
were kind of the folks that I
was hanging out with and I

00:17:28.714,00:17:32.518
really looked up to and when
they were willing to bring me in
it just you know it it- it meant

00:17:32.518,00:17:36.656
the world to me. But what I saw
with the L0pht because what-
what we were doing with the

00:17:36.656,00:17:42.161
L0pht and and when Dill came in
with the L0pht is we really
started going heavy heavily into

00:17:42.161,00:17:46.699
full disclosure and and we’re
con- you know we’re credited
with kind of pioneering a lot of

00:17:46.699,00:17:53.105
like what it became. The- the
the- controversy some of the
animosity to it. Uh as well but

00:17:53.105,00:17:58.711
it was all about um we’re going
to bring transparency to some of
these security problems. Uh

00:17:58.711,00:18:04.050
because big corporations you on-
I was working at uh Bolt,
Beranek, and Newman this little

00:18:04.050,00:18:10.156
company called BBN uh which uh
had created TCP IP and the
internet uh for DARPA many many

00:18:10.156,00:18:13.826
years ago and I was like “I get
to work here, this is
fantastic!” And they were

00:18:13.826,00:18:18.664
starting to move over to
Windows. And we saw a bunch of
vulnerabilities there and we

00:18:18.664,00:18:22.702
went back to Microsoft. This was
you know the Department of
Defense and government

00:18:22.702,00:18:28.574
contractors. And Microsoft was
at that point where they were
becoming so large that you know

00:18:28.574,00:18:31.711
in the US government and other
governments really couldn’t
influence them. There was a

00:18:31.711,00:18:36.482
bigger sort of market for them
to play to. Um and so they said
“We don’t care!” Uh they

00:18:36.482,00:18:40.519
literally you know that was kind
of they’re response. It’s not a
security problem unless you know

00:18:40.519,00:18:44.523
it’s- it’s affecting our bottom
line. Uh and I went to Tad Elmer
who was the CEO at the time,

00:18:44.523,00:18:49.695
actually it might have been
George Conrades uh I get them
flipped around uh and I said

00:18:49.695,00:18:52.365
“Hey, you know, I’m with the
L0pht, the- this hacker group.”
And they were like “We have no

00:18:52.365,00:18:58.804
clue what you’re talking about.
Whatever.’’ I’m like Um. I think
I can get them to respond uh if

00:18:58.804,00:19:03.209
you know uh if I do some things
but it’s not associated with
this company. So we started

00:19:03.209,00:19:09.882
pushing you know vulnerability
disclosure and uh advisories and
so we started giving proof and

00:19:09.882,00:19:15.788
exploit code and proof of
concept um because Microsoft
could no longer say “That’s not

00:19:15.788,00:19:19.492
a problem, that’s just
theoretical.” Uh you know
because now everybody could do

00:19:19.492,00:19:24.764
it. And they started to move in
response. Um. >>That was
actually the- 1 of the L0pht uh

00:19:24.764,00:19:28.601
slogans was “Making the
Theoretical Practical Since
1992” [laughter]So that’s where

00:19:28.601,00:19:33.773
that really came from. So.
>>Yup. And- and the- the really
fat- fascinating part with uh

00:19:33.773,00:19:39.945
cDc because cDc had this sort of
like bad cop in the way I was
trying to help uh prop the L0pht

00:19:39.945,00:19:43.949
up for like uh you know I don’t
want to call it brand
recognition but like where we

00:19:43.949,00:19:49.188
came across was you know this
sort of like neutral cop.
[chuckles] Uh sort of set up and

00:19:49.188,00:19:54.960
we were doing the same thing and
here I got to play both sides
and say if we release uh an

00:19:54.960,00:19:59.765
advisory through Cult of the
Dead Cow and if we release the
same sort of information through

00:19:59.765,00:20:04.470
the L0pht, it’s the same
message, just packaged
differently coming from a

00:20:04.470,00:20:08.441
different source and it got a
very different reception.
>>Yeah. >>Uh and it was

00:20:08.441,00:20:12.411
fascinating. So BO uh which
you’re gonna hear about you know
Back Orifice and Back Orifice 2K

00:20:12.411,00:20:17.716
you know came across 1 way and
we we played to see if
something’s released and it has

00:20:17.716,00:20:22.054
a negative spin can you ever
claw it back? And if something
releases with a somewhat neutral

00:20:22.054,00:20:26.258
or positive spin, does it you
know does it become perturbed?
So it became this great sort of

00:20:26.258,00:20:31.731
like culture jamming like uh
petri dish to really mess around
with and so I mean I was in

00:20:31.731,00:20:36.769
love. >>So I- I just I just
think 1 of the really incredible
things going back and looking at

00:20:36.769,00:20:40.840
this whole history is that you
know at the time you know
hackers were still you know they

00:20:40.840,00:20:43.576
were sort of coming into their
own in the late 90’s they you
know were really starting to get

00:20:43.576,00:20:47.646
attention uh people were
concerned, people were
interested, they were vaguely

00:20:47.646,00:20:52.818
threatening um they were a
little scary. And despite like
the pedigree of the people at

00:20:52.818,00:20:57.823
the L0pht um the way to actually
make change was to be like
cartoonishly villainous. You

00:21:00.526,00:21:05.531
know so Grandmaster Ratte’ here
on on the stage pacing up and
down, rapping um with gold gold

00:21:07.700,00:21:12.905
chains and rabbit fur chaps and
throwing CDs into the crowd.
>>Literally igniting his crotch

00:21:12.905,00:21:18.811
on fire with flash powder.
>>That happened more than once I
think. [laughter] >>Not- not

00:21:18.811,00:21:23.682
recommended. >> No. [laughter]
>>But but that that generated
media. That you know that got

00:21:23.682,00:21:28.854
the cameras. And- >>It sure did.
>>And Microsoft you know when
somebody from NBC or ABC or

00:21:28.854,00:21:33.092
whatever sticks uh a microphone
in Microsoft’s face and is like
“Well what are you gonna do

00:21:33.092,00:21:37.296
about these evil hackers that
are gonna allow anybody to hack
anything?” You know they had

00:21:37.296,00:21:43.035
then they actually have to come
up with an answer. So so Back
Orifice came first by Sir Dystic

00:21:43.035,00:21:48.040
uh here in uh 90 uh s- 90- uh-
>>8 >>98 thank you. Um and uh so
that was the widely distributed

00:21:52.144,00:21:57.483
trojan um and uh after that
Microsoft could have said “Yeah,
you’re right, we really need to

00:21:57.483,00:22:02.788
build in some security with TCP
IP.” Um but instead they said
“You know what, it’s not our

00:22:02.788,00:22:06.892
problem at all. But if you’re
really concerned-” yeah, “If
you’re really concerned, uh then

00:22:06.892,00:22:11.564
you can upgrade to uh Windows NT
or Windows 2000.” >>and 2000
>>So they used it as an

00:22:11.564,00:22:17.136
opportunity to upsell. So I at
that point I probably would have
given up um but instead cDc

00:22:17.136,00:22:22.508
brings uh Dildog here into the
picture and has him write BO2K
so what what were you trying to

00:22:22.508,00:22:27.513
- why why didn’t you give up and
how was BO2K like more more of a
poke at Microsoft then BO? >>Um

00:22:31.917,00:22:36.755
well um the BO2- >>And and were
you independently wealthy? I
mean how could you- how could do

00:22:36.755,00:22:41.760
this? [laughter] >>He’s he’s
begging the my answer here. Um I
got involved uh with L0pht

00:22:45.397,00:22:51.971
through just random social
connections uh so like 1994 was
when I uh went to MIT and

00:22:51.971,00:22:56.976
started to uh kind of get the
sense that um there was some
hacker culture there. Um and got

00:22:59.478,00:23:04.416
very interested in in the whole
field of security um I met the
L0pht folks in 96 uh when I went

00:23:06.885,00:23:10.889
to DEFCON 4 uh which is now 23
years ago. Um and uh we decided
that we needed to talk some more

00:23:10.889,00:23:12.891
after they had seen some of the
stuff that I was doing so we
ended up um you know I ended up

00:23:12.891,00:23:17.896
becoming the first employee of
the L0pht actually in I believe
97 uh so uh working on L0pht

00:23:26.305,00:23:30.709
crack and things like that were
bringing in some revenue into
the L0pht uh so that I didn't

00:23:30.709,00:23:36.015
have to do my day job which at
the time was just working at a
bank uh you know I told my mom

00:23:36.015,00:23:40.986
“Yeah, I’m gonna quit my day job
at the bank that I worked 4
years at MIT to do. And uh and

00:23:40.986,00:23:44.556
I’m gonna go work with a bunch
of hairy hackers in a warehouse
and make no money until uh we

00:23:44.556,00:23:49.295
sell a bunch of copies of a
password cracker!” And um
[laughter] yeah they l- she was

00:23:49.295,00:23:53.365
like “You better know what
you’re doing!” I’m like “Oh yeah
yeah.” It was great.[laughter]

00:23:53.365,00:23:58.504
Uh >>And then he saw my code and
he was like “I have no clue what
I got into.” >>Oh my God. Fix

00:23:58.504,00:24:02.875
this sh*t. [laughter] Um
[laughter] >>Yeah >>Anyway um
and so you know we we got the

00:24:02.875,00:24:08.080
L0pht crack out there and um I
was searching for other things
to do. Saw Back Orifice was very

00:24:08.080,00:24:13.118
uh inspired, I was just like
wow! Uh the notion of remote
control and remote

00:24:13.118,00:24:18.090
administration of Windows
systems was kinda near and dear
to my heart. Um back in 96

00:24:18.090,00:24:23.529
hacking Windows was considered
extremely lame. Nobody was
hacking Windows because systems

00:24:23.529,00:24:27.966
were not like no one was using
Windows NT for anything
important. It was all like the

00:24:27.966,00:24:34.039
the the Solaris and the Alteryx
and all this other you know big
name Unix brands that uh were

00:24:34.039,00:24:40.179
cool to hack and Windows was not
cool to hack. Um so I you know
naturally gravitated toward this

00:24:40.179,00:24:44.750
‘cause I saw it becoming a big
deal and you know published a
lot of buffer overflow exploits

00:24:44.750,00:24:48.520
and things like that and got
really deep into the system
programming uh and kernel

00:24:48.520,00:24:53.525
programming and uh when I
realized how um expressive and
verbose and ridiculously broad

00:24:57.429,00:25:01.934
the Linux cred- sorry the Linux-
sorry I’ve been doing that too
lately, um the Windows kernel

00:25:01.934,00:25:08.374
was, um it was you could do so
much as a regular user. Like so
much that you could get away

00:25:08.374,00:25:13.278
with. Um you know opening up
threads inside other processes
that you didn’t start. And then

00:25:13.278,00:25:17.015
uh you know injecting code into
them and then running extra
threads in those process spaces

00:25:17.015,00:25:22.287
I mean there’s just- the the
amount of stuff you could get
away with was so big that uh

00:25:22.287,00:25:28.260
the- I wouldn’t call it attack
surface but your- your ability
to uh create extremely creative

00:25:28.260,00:25:32.698
programs that did things that
nobody expected, uh was
completely supported by the OS.

00:25:32.698,00:25:37.803
And it and it wasn’t there were
no um there were no exploits
required. >>That’s why I’m here!

00:25:37.803,00:25:41.640
>>Right there were no exploits
required to write Back Orifice
2000 it was just the design of

00:25:41.640,00:25:46.645
the thing was so um security
unaware that you could get away
with doing amazingly like uh

00:25:48.914,00:25:54.853
unprotected things uh uh and and
purch- surreptitious things uh
completely within the bounds of

00:25:54.853,00:26:00.759
the security uh uh you know um
designs of of Windows so. >>Yeah
I mean it actually gave you it

00:26:00.759,00:26:04.730
gave the the person remotely
more control- >>More control.
>>Of the computer than you had.

00:26:04.730,00:26:10.836
>>It was faster to use BO2K to
do administration than it was to
do it at using your own mouse uh

00:26:10.836,00:26:16.141
you know and keyboard. Um. >>In-
in fact we’ve- you even released
a a professional pack later-

00:26:16.141,00:26:20.579
>>The L0pht- yeah the L0pht had
it- had its own uh commercial
BO2K plugin set that no one

00:26:20.579,00:26:24.750
bought [laughter] umm. >>Well
it- it was also free I think.
[laughter] But they still didn’t

00:26:24.750,00:26:28.687
buy it. >>Um I- that’s true
maybe we did give it away. Um
but it was yeah like a remote

00:26:28.687,00:26:32.591
file browser and uh registry
editor and things like that.
>>We wanted to have parity with

00:26:32.591,00:26:36.395
remotely possible and all the
other alike things like PC
anywheres and be like that yeah

00:26:36.395,00:26:41.233
this is a legitimate tool. Which
again kinda goes back to- >>I do
I do know at least a uh a few

00:26:41.233,00:26:44.870
people that used it
legitimately. It’s uh- >>I mean
you know I was the person who

00:26:44.870,00:26:48.507
was getting the email and I got
emails all the time from people
like “Hey I’m in the Navy and we

00:26:48.507,00:26:53.045
use this tr- to administer all
the- all the uh machines in our
lab.” >>So speaking of which for

00:26:53.045,00:26:57.816
folks who aren’t aware just a
little context what what what
Dil actually did with BO2K and

00:26:57.816,00:27:02.521
actually Sir Dystic kind of
pioneered with it was everyone
of the major implants that you

00:27:02.521,00:27:07.693
see today, the core
functionality can literally be
traced back to this. And I’ve

00:27:07.693,00:27:13.365
actually got the history on both
sides to say it can be traced
back to this. >>Yeah and so it

00:27:13.365,00:27:18.370
was a- it was a- it was fun
[applause] [chuckles] thanks. Um
uh yeah so yeah B02, BO2K was a

00:27:23.408,00:27:27.880
big deal. I was I had a lot- a
lot of fun writing it um you
know my- my challenges were

00:27:27.880,00:27:34.319
making it nice and small and
compact um you know I- you know
wrote it without LIB-C um so you

00:27:34.319,00:27:39.324
know and comparable tools were
you know megabytes and tens of
megabytes of size it was like

00:27:39.324,00:27:43.595
160k or something total when
compiled. >>It was really tiny.
>>Uh you know just some of the

00:27:43.595,00:27:48.300
technical challenges there. I
had a real fun time with uh with
the Windows kernel and uh it was

00:27:48.300,00:27:53.005
uh I don’t know. I- am I even
answering the question you
asked, Joe? [laughter] I I just

00:27:53.005,00:27:57.075
love that sh*t. >>Let me add as-
as a side note we actually
thought about selling BO2K for a

00:27:57.075,00:28:03.048
dollar um so a a as a- as a
remote administration tool it
competed with um Symantec’s

00:28:03.048,00:28:08.787
PCAnywhere and some other stuff,
if you were running an antivirus
app, it did not detect

00:28:08.787,00:28:11.957
PCAnywhere - or- >>Even though
it did exactly the same thing.
>>Or any of these other

00:28:11.957,00:28:16.395
commercial utilities even though
you could trick somebody into
installing that and using it

00:28:16.395,00:28:20.632
just like BO2K. It did not uh
anti virus inventors did not
detect those commercial programs

00:28:20.632,00:28:25.237
because it would be restraint of
trade. Right um they’re making
money off of it and you’re

00:28:25.237,00:28:30.142
basically depriving them of
money. And so for a short time
we thought about actually well

00:28:30.142,00:28:35.847
we could get um anti virus
vendors to not detect BO2K if we
sold it for a dollar. Um and so-

00:28:35.847,00:28:39.718
>>Do you remember why we didn’t
sell it? >>N- you can talk about
that. >>No why don’t you- why

00:28:39.718,00:28:45.624
don’t you talk about it. >>You
can. Go ahead. >>So so uh to set
the stage uh you know at at the

00:28:45.624,00:28:50.295
time uh crypto was was a
munition as far as the the US
government was concerned.

00:28:50.295,00:28:55.334
>>Right. >>And 1 difference
between BO and BO2K is that we
wanted strong encryption, we

00:28:55.334,00:29:01.106
wanted meaningful encryption um
because I guess l- did we was it
just ExOR in in uh >>It was ExOR

00:29:01.106,00:29:04.076
>>in in the original Back
Orifice whereas- >>Twice! >>Yeah
[chuckles] It was ROT26? >>Yeah.

00:29:04.076,00:29:09.081
>>Um so uh and what what was it
what what did you use in BO2K?
>>Um BO2K had a pluggable

00:29:14.653,00:29:18.523
architecture so you could plug
in different crypto systems.
>>Yeah yeah but it came by

00:29:18.523,00:29:23.161
default- >>But it came with
Triple DES by default. >>Yeah
Triple DES. >>And people wrote

00:29:23.161,00:29:27.499
um you know blowfish in AES uh
rained all before it was AES.
>>So but but part of this is

00:29:27.499,00:29:32.638
because encryption crypto was
considered a munition where like
well people are gonna be down on

00:29:32.638,00:29:37.676
this from all over the world. We
assume. W- how do we handle
that? So we actually hired uh a

00:29:37.676,00:29:44.149
lawyer. Um it was uh uh are we
allowed to say? >>Yeah sure.
We’re allowed to say. >>Uh Cindy

00:29:44.149,00:29:49.187
Kohn who’se now with >>With the
EFF >>With the EFF [applause] Um
so we you know we retained a

00:29:49.187,00:29:54.993
lawyer and said “Hey we want to
do this um how much jail are we
gonna go to?” [laughter] Um and-

00:29:54.993,00:29:58.797
>>That was a really frequent
thing on the mailing list. >>Yes
yes it was. >>It was. >>Yeah it

00:29:58.797,00:30:04.903
really was. Um and so you know
basically she said uh “Don’t
sell it. [chuckles] That’s-

00:30:04.903,00:30:09.908
that’s a totally different
kettle of fish.” And um you have
to at least make it make uh a

00:30:13.011,00:30:18.150
different version without the uh
the Triple DES available and you
can say “Hey if you’re in- if

00:30:18.150,00:30:21.853
you’re outside the United States
download this 1 instead.”
>>Right. >>Kinda thing. >>To- to

00:30:21.853,00:30:25.323
give an example sorry- of if I
could just- >>So we- we- I’m
sorry go ahead. >>Oh I was just

00:30:25.323,00:30:29.428
gonna say off the- the 1 part of
the it was a really common sort
of like how you know how many-

00:30:29.428,00:30:34.066
how much how many years of jail
are we gonna serve for this? Um
it- the back and forth between

00:30:34.066,00:30:38.403
the L0pht and cDc for the exact
same sort of thing, with the
crypto as a munition sort of

00:30:38.403,00:30:43.108
thing, uh we even set up during
this time period we were like
hey wait a second in the L0pht

00:30:43.108,00:30:49.514
we actually went and started to
get our license to manufacture
uh firearms and high capacity

00:30:49.514,00:30:54.152
and everything else because we
found a loophole in the crypto
law that says once you are a

00:30:54.152,00:30:59.024
manufacturer- >>Of munitions.
>>Of munitions- >>And you have a
license- >>Ammunition. >>For

00:30:59.024,00:31:04.896
munitions, you can do crypto.
And anybody could go to the
store front on the Charles River

00:31:04.896,00:31:09.735
or anything else, sell a
“prototype” into some military
or you know government agency of

00:31:09.735,00:31:14.306
like uh it’s got like a little
less flash bang or something on
it or whatever and you got this

00:31:14.306,00:31:17.776
license and then all of the
sudden you could do crypto back
and forth so we were trying to

00:31:17.776,00:31:22.347
show that it was this sort of
like you know loophole and it
really was a false flag and it

00:31:22.347,00:31:26.852
was really this red herring sort
of set up and that was the
beautiful part about the L0pht

00:31:26.852,00:31:31.323
and the cDc is that we could see
this thing on each side and go
hey wait we figured this out

00:31:31.323,00:31:36.528
here ok well yeah but they view
us as X, well let’s try it as Y.
Oh look they viewed us as Y, ok

00:31:36.528,00:31:43.368
well bounce it back over to X.
>>Right. Uh so I wanna do some
some @Stake now. Um so the

00:31:43.368,00:31:48.673
industry is rapidly evolving, um
Microsoft brings uh and AOL
bring the internet to everybody

00:31:48.673,00:31:52.844
and cDc and the L0pht suggest
that maybe they ought to put in
some security as well so they

00:31:52.844,00:31:58.583
get around to that a little bit.
Um but it’s 99, 2000, people are
making all kinds of money. Um

00:31:58.583,00:32:03.522
and why not try to try to go
pro? So um uh thus L0pht takes
some venture money and becomes-

00:32:05.957,00:32:11.663
uh becomes @Stake um which
lasts- lasts about 5 years. So
some really amazing things

00:32:11.663,00:32:17.803
happened at @Stake. Um some
things didn’t work out so well.
Um why don’t you guys uh talk a

00:32:17.803,00:32:22.774
little bit about uh the @Stake,
@Stake experience? >>Um I’ll
lead it off I guess. I’m the 1

00:32:22.774,00:32:27.445
that got us into that moress-
mess. Um I- I say that there was
some really awesome stuff that

00:32:27.445,00:32:32.384
came out of it. You can trace
almost- I mean you can trace a
lot of really uh influential

00:32:32.384,00:32:37.389
people influential organizations
uh Alex Stamos uh Dave Goldsmith
you know um Monsanto it it uh

00:32:40.091,00:32:43.895
there- there was a lot of good
that came out of it um. There
was a lot of like you know

00:32:43.895,00:32:48.533
>>[inaudible] and Window Snyder.
>>Yeah absolutely. >>Sure,
they’re very good. >>Yep. >>A

00:32:48.533,00:32:55.407
lot of a lot of technologies and
uh people uh started amazing
things after @Stake. >>Um now

00:32:55.407,00:33:01.446
for the L0pht it it was kind of
like a defining mo- moment after
we had gone from a hobby group

00:33:01.446,00:33:06.484
uh into something with a
direction and a mission uh into
something that ultimately uh you

00:33:06.484,00:33:11.089
know was a lot of friction uh in
other areas. And what we had
wanted to do was we wanted to

00:33:11.089,00:33:16.461
turn you know we we loved our
hobbies uh and we all had day
jobs for it, uh and a couple of

00:33:16.461,00:33:20.665
things that I had written and
that you know Will contributed
too or whatever made enough

00:33:20.665,00:33:24.536
money that we were able to bring
in our first you know paid
employee uh for it and we were

00:33:24.536,00:33:30.942
like well wait a second how can
we kinda go pro such that we can
do what we love rather than what

00:33:30.942,00:33:34.713
we’re doing during our day- day
jobs because we don’t
necessarily all love our day

00:33:34.713,00:33:40.585
jobs. What we didn’t understand
at the time was kind of like how
the VCs you know seemed to align

00:33:40.585,00:33:46.791
with us but maybe didn’t uh
entirely. Um but you know that-
mm it you know it sounded good.

00:33:46.791,00:33:53.231
And you know well some hard
knocks came but um it it le- it
turned out to be a really

00:33:53.231,00:33:57.235
interesting complex system. And
anytime there’s there’s a
complex system you know there’s

00:33:57.235,00:34:01.640
a lot to be learned there. Uh
and you know the- the
divestiture and the different

00:34:01.640,00:34:06.444
branches that spread out from it
like Veracode that came from the
L0pht all the way through @Stake

00:34:06.444,00:34:10.916
incubated at @Stake um and a lot
of other ones were very
positive. >>Yeah. Let’s hear

00:34:10.916,00:34:15.921
about Veracode. >>Um Veracode’s
early uh beginnings were uh a
decompiler effort that I had

00:34:20.158,00:34:26.298
started in 1999 at the L0pht um
I had been doing a lot of
reverse engineering by hand uh

00:34:26.298,00:34:29.768
found that much of what I was
doing was very repetitive. And I
wanted to build a tool that

00:34:29.768,00:34:31.770
would help me do it faster. Um
so uh I found a very early
decompiler uh research paper by

00:34:31.770,00:34:33.772
Cristina Cifuentes from the
Queensland University of
Technology, read through that,

00:34:33.772,00:34:35.774
um, it's the same research paper
that um you know uh resulted in
things like Hex-Rays and ghidra

00:34:35.774,00:34:40.779
and things like that um so I I
was 1 of the first to really go
through this paper and and find

00:34:51.323,00:34:56.328
um uh ways to enhance what- what
had been done there to produce
high level models of uh low

00:35:06.338,00:35:11.343
level binaries. Um and we got
funding through @Stake to
continue to do that research

00:35:14.412,00:35:19.284
while I was there. Um I remember
@Stake had a very vibrant
research team which was the

00:35:19.284,00:35:25.490
L0pht plus some other folks that
we hired along the way um and
the the safe decompiler which

00:35:25.490,00:35:30.295
used to be called the UDS which
was the un-developers studio um-
>>Also named after our

00:35:30.295,00:35:36.034
contraceptive devices. >>Nah nah
uh it I I no. Uh [laughter] We-
>>It was the L0pht there was

00:35:36.034,00:35:41.039
some humor. >>It was the L0pht
we we had a lot of bad jokes in
there. Um so I I ended up um

00:35:43.308,00:35:49.114
sort of shepherding that IP
through @Stake, um getting some
employees, you know building a

00:35:49.114,00:35:54.119
product and eventually when it
got sold to Symantec we
basically we had no way of um uh

00:35:57.322,00:36:00.959
keeping that project alive
unless we found a way to spin it
out. Um Symantec wasn’t going to

00:36:00.959,00:36:05.296
do anything with the decompiler.
We we talked to some of their
executives and they were like

00:36:05.296,00:36:09.968
it’s a C plus plus thing, we
don’t do C plus plus anymore.
And we’re like huh? Well

00:36:09.968,00:36:15.840
apparently Symantec had a C plus
plus compiler that they had been
selling for a while it was

00:36:15.840,00:36:18.676
actually- >>To compete with
Borland. >>To compete with
Borland it was Symantec C plus

00:36:18.676,00:36:22.380
plus so when they stopped doing
that they just kind of looked at
what we were building on paper

00:36:22.380,00:36:26.484
and said no we don’t do C plus
plus anymore. And they they
basically let VeraCode walk

00:36:26.484,00:36:32.257
right out the door. Um so you
know we’ve got some venture
capital, um proceeded to get it

00:36:32.257,00:36:39.197
funded and built the company. Um
the first to do binary analysis
of things that were you know not

00:36:39.197,00:36:43.802
necessarily on your desktop but
sent to you across the internet.
You know people wouldn’t send

00:36:43.802,00:36:47.405
source code for analysis across
the internet, because it was
con- generally considered to be

00:36:47.405,00:36:51.176
too valuable uh to let out the
door. But they'd be willing to
ship you binaries because

00:36:51.176,00:36:54.646
they’re gonna ship those anyways
so there was a business model
there you know you could provide

00:36:54.646,00:36:58.950
a service. >>Chris sorry. We
have- we have like 10 minutes
so. >>Sure I I can just keep

00:36:58.950,00:37:03.888
talking about hacktivism. >>Uh
ok so Misha um Omega uh talk to
us about uh so we got we got

00:37:07.025,00:37:10.361
awesome stuff in the private
sector. You can take my word for
it if you don’t know that Mudge

00:37:10.361,00:37:15.667
did amazing stuff in the
government sector. Um tell us a
little bit about um Oxblood

00:37:15.667,00:37:21.706
Ruffin’s entry into the group uh
and the sort of like the birth
of hacktivism and um how it’s

00:37:21.706,00:37:27.579
evolved since. >>Ok um it I’m
gonna have to share some of the
story with Luke I think. >>I can

00:37:27.579,00:37:32.517
say that the way that Oxblood uh
introduced himself to us is by
sending me an email insulting

00:37:32.517,00:37:37.122
Count 0 and then [laughs] that
was enough to me. He was like I
love all you guys except for

00:37:37.122,00:37:41.993
that f*cker Count 0. And I was
like what? What did Count 0 do
to you? [laughter] >>See he came

00:37:41.993,00:37:47.465
at- he came at us in this kind
of again like like Luke said in
this kind of uh strange strange

00:37:47.465,00:37:52.804
way and um developed a
conversation with a couple of-
of cDc members and we ended up

00:37:52.804,00:37:59.711
meeting him at uh DEFCON 1 year
and he basically he met us
almost on day 1 with a pitch. Um

00:37:59.711,00:38:04.649
you guys are pranksters and um
jesters um and you have this
stage a little bit uh have you

00:38:07.218,00:38:12.090
thought about doing anything
more substantial with the media
that you can get? Or with the

00:38:12.090,00:38:15.760
the attention you can get. Have
you ever thought about doing
anything more than- but- with

00:38:15.760,00:38:22.300
that? And um I think my response
was why can’t we have both? Um
you know? Porque no los dos?

00:38:22.300,00:38:27.305
[laughter] And uh so anyways we
we we ended up inducting um um
uh Oxblood into cDc eventually

00:38:30.842,00:38:35.713
um and he brought a different he
he definitely brought a
different perspective.

00:38:35.713,00:38:40.752
>>Different sensibility.
>>Different sensibility. He um
had a back ground um working at

00:38:40.752,00:38:46.191
the United Nations. He clearly
had uh like a marketing um
background to him he had a

00:38:46.191,00:38:52.530
marketing head to him. Um he um
kind of pushed us in certain
directions for branding or

00:38:52.530,00:38:57.535
messaging um. And he had he kind
of brought um uh uh sort of the
social um- >>Consciousness.

00:39:01.739,00:39:08.479
>>Consciousness, yeah! To to to
cDc. Um and this is around the
time when um the the the great

00:39:08.479,00:39:14.652
firewall of China started
happening and China was um
starting to expand out into the

00:39:14.652,00:39:19.657
rest of the world um and uh for
various personal reasons he had
uh an interest in China. And uh

00:39:23.461,00:39:28.466
we kind of f- for for various uh
uh current event reasons and and
also because this is sort of his

00:39:31.069,00:39:36.074
pet peeve, uh we kind of focused
on China as um uh just a focus
of attention. And um China

00:39:40.111,00:39:45.116
became uh kind of a r- a reason
for trying out different ideas.
And hacktivism became 1 of them.

00:39:48.086,00:39:52.423
>>Alright so I just um just to
make sure that we hit a couple
things uh before questions. Oh

00:39:52.423,00:39:57.795
and I forgot to say earlier,
we’re all gonna sign books uh at
4:15 in the vendor area in uh in

00:39:57.795,00:40:02.433
uh in Bally’s. >>But before you
break off I mean you can’t go
from China without talking about

00:40:02.433,00:40:06.271
Slobodan Milosevic and the cDc
being in the Hague. >>I just
wanted to- I just wanted to hit

00:40:06.271,00:40:12.043
a couple things before. So um so
1 of the great things that they
did is they had a hacktivism uh

00:40:12.043,00:40:18.383
panel here at here at DEFCON uh
a couple years later and Patrick
Ball uh was like actual

00:40:18.383,00:40:23.521
practitioner technologist in the
field working on human- human
rights compiling databases,

00:40:23.521,00:40:28.426
making sure they’re compatible,
it’s like cross reference uh you
know the- the Army officers you

00:40:28.426,00:40:32.864
know where they were with when
the most human rights abuses
happened and you know come up

00:40:32.864,00:40:37.835
with the worst abusers and then
try and get them fired. He- he
went after uh Slobodan Milosevic

00:40:37.835,00:40:43.441
and uh who served as his own
defense attorney at the Hague
and there is a great exchange uh

00:40:43.441,00:40:49.547
where Slobodan Milosevic asked
Patrick Ball you know wh- what
is your affiliation with this uh

00:40:49.547,00:40:54.619
Dead Cow Cult? Um [laughter]
>>You can find- >>Luke! >>Yeah
you can find the video on the

00:40:54.619,00:40:59.457
Hague website [cheers] >>If
you’re- if you’re- >>So when we
saw that it I- it was just like

00:40:59.457,00:41:04.329
um that’s crazy and I’m not sure
I like the fact that this you
know genocidal dictator knows

00:41:04.329,00:41:08.900
who were are. [laughter] >>Yeah
it’s the international criminal
court of for- former Yugoslavia

00:41:08.900,00:41:12.437
if you search through the
transcripts for Cult of the Dead
Cow you’ll come up with many

00:41:12.437,00:41:16.207
many hits, we’re referenced
it’s- >>Yeah Ratband, Wattage,
like it- >>Yeah yeah >>More than

00:41:16.207,00:41:20.011
once. >>Yeah >>So you know
you’ve arrived as a hacktivist
organization when your name

00:41:20.011,00:41:26.684
checked in the war crimes
tribunal not once but [laughter]
3 times. 3 times. [applause]

00:41:26.684,00:41:32.924
>>Uh wow. >>So um uh among the
uh among the influences and
impact of of the group in this

00:41:32.924,00:41:38.930
in this sort of this tranche of
it was tor. Uh so Oxblood and
friends uh tried to do privacy

00:41:38.930,00:41:44.035
protecting browser which in turn
convinced Dingledine to put a
browser into tor which is a

00:41:44.035,00:41:47.972
pretty good idea in retrospect.
Uh they of- >>N- Navy had
something to do with that

00:41:47.972,00:41:52.710
earlier also. >>Yeah n- I mean
Navy first and then it- and then
it spun off and then they were

00:41:52.710,00:41:57.648
like hey that’s a good idea we
should uh adopt that. Um and uh
they had it a significant

00:41:57.648,00:42:01.386
influence in the early days of
the Citizen Lab uh were awesome
people at the University of

00:42:01.386,00:42:07.325
Toronto who track governments
using malware against their own
citizens. Uh so uh that lives

00:42:07.325,00:42:11.763
on. So I I think we oughta go-
go to questions or we’re not
gonna get to uh get to any. Um

00:42:11.763,00:42:17.135
so I forget how this works. Will
we have mics? Does anybody know?
>>If you don’t have mics just

00:42:17.135,00:42:20.104
scream and whoever is the
loudest. >>I was thinking just
you know write write your

00:42:20.104,00:42:25.076
questions on 20 dollar bills
[laughter] and just bring ‘em
up. >>Some things never change.

00:42:37.255,00:42:39.257
[unclear question from audience]
[laughter] [unclear question
continues] Mm hmm. [unclear

00:42:39.257,00:42:43.294
question continues] So uh I will
restate it because uh that this
is this needs amplification

00:42:43.294,00:42:49.133
which is you’re looking at a
panel of really white guys from
a middle class sort of uh

00:42:49.133,00:42:54.539
situation and where the h*ll is
the diversity? And there was
diversity there so why isn’t the

00:42:54.539,00:42:59.610
diversity here now? >>Where are
they? >>Did I catch that
correctly? >>Yes where are they?

00:42:59.610,00:43:05.583
>>Uh Lady Carolin didn’t want to
come [laughter] Um uh but I will
be seeing her this weekend. She

00:43:05.583,00:43:10.788
just l- >>This this is really
really important and and and
this uh thank you because what’s

00:43:10.788,00:43:13.891
1 of the things that we actually
really cherished and it was 1 of
the things that Beto O’Rourke

00:43:13.891,00:43:17.562
actually brought in because-
>>Yeah he integrated- >>He was 1
of the earliest people and I’m

00:43:17.562,00:43:22.133
not you know I’m not trying to
push for this, he was an early
cDc member, but he was the 1

00:43:22.133,00:43:26.571
that even back then wanted
diversity. And wanted to bring
in like different sorts of

00:43:26.571,00:43:30.107
opinions and it was something
that we really cherished at the
L0pht. And the L0pht was very

00:43:30.107,00:43:36.848
white as well uh and all male uh
as well we had MegaHacker and we
actually had everybody else but

00:43:36.848,00:43:40.618
uh it’s 1 of these things where
we loved challenging each other
we liked the fact that people

00:43:40.618,00:43:44.088
came up from different
backgrounds, from different
understandings, with different

00:43:44.088,00:43:49.026
experiences and stuff and we
were all frustrated that our
experiences weren’t different

00:43:49.026,00:43:53.664
enough. And if you are running a
security group or if you are
working with different people

00:43:53.664,00:43:58.636
and you look around and
everybody looks likes you,
you’re not good defenders and

00:43:58.636,00:44:03.908
you’re not good hackers because
where you get the different
ideas and the different

00:44:03.908,00:44:08.579
perspectives and how to
challenge what you’re looking at
is from diversity. The more

00:44:08.579,00:44:14.118
diverse the team you have is,
the better you are at finding
the vulnerabilities, seeing

00:44:14.118,00:44:20.525
things differently. So either
you become the old guard and you
say “No, nobody else joins.” Or

00:44:20.525,00:44:25.530
you become the old guard and you
say “I welcome the diversity,
let’s move forward.” Thank you.

00:44:32.870,00:44:37.875
[applause] >>1- 1 more question.
Yikes. >>[audience member asking
question] >>So the c- uh the

00:44:44.882,00:44:49.687
comment was we didn’t talk- uh
talk about the testimony to
Congress uh and what that meant.

00:44:49.687,00:44:54.458
Uh and real briefly I mean that
was uh the cDc actually helped
prop that up. There was a lot I

00:44:54.458,00:44:57.962
mean we wouldn’t have had the
publicity and the recognition
for the L0pht to do it

00:44:57.962,00:45:01.799
otherwise. There was a lot of uh
behind the scenes, I was working
with the National Security

00:45:01.799,00:45:06.270
Council. Uh and Joe actually
mentioned something that I
thought was kind of interesting

00:45:06.270,00:45:09.840
cause he said “You know we
should talk about testifying to
Congress and how that wasn’t

00:45:09.840,00:45:14.478
enough.” Uh and you know it’s
like it was almost like and I I
took this and I was like oh that

00:45:14.478,00:45:18.716
hurts because it’s not like we
thought we were gonna fix the
problem, but testifying to

00:45:18.716,00:45:23.120
Congress and and it took a lot
of convincing to get the L0pht
and the other folks to go there,

00:45:23.120,00:45:26.657
was to open the door. To show
that there can be a
communication between 2

00:45:26.657,00:45:32.229
different groups that don’t see
eye to eye, maybe never should
see eye to eye, but have certain

00:45:32.229,00:45:36.467
things that they’re ok with
together and actually you know
work things out and understand

00:45:36.467,00:45:42.340
each other and build
sensitivities. Um so I really
view that as that’s what cDc to

00:45:42.340,00:45:47.311
me means it’s what the L0pht to
me means, it’s what I did in CFT
at DARPA and everything else I

00:45:47.311,00:45:51.082
just I wanna open the door,
everybody else can take it
further because that’s what I

00:45:51.082,00:45:56.754
wish had happened to us back
then. >>OK uh thank you very
much uh, I hope to see you at

00:45:56.754,00:46:01.692
the signing and uh, and it’s
good to be back. [applause]
>>Thanks everybody. [applause]

00:46:07.365,00:46:12.637
>>If uh, if anyone’s interested,
I have a very limited number of
uh 35th anniversary cDc

00:46:12.637,00:46:16.173
challenge coins for sale and if
you want 1 just pick me up.
