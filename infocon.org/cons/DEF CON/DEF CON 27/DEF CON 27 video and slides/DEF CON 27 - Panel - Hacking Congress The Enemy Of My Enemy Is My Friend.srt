00:00:00.500,00:00:06.240
>>Well good for DEFCON for
realizing that a very important
person is sitting to my right

00:00:06.240,00:00:11.245
and he needs to be heard. And if
he can’t get on that stage, he’s
on this stage [cheers]. So

00:00:16.817,00:00:21.421
[applause] can everybody see me
just a little bit here? Sort of
yeah, yeah yeah! And you can

00:00:21.421,00:00:26.426
hear me. I’m Jane Harman uh I’m
a recovering politician
[laughter] and I am thrilled to

00:00:30.631,00:00:35.636
be just beneath the main stage
at DEFCON [laughter] with a
group of folks who come from

00:00:38.739,00:00:43.744
very different communities.
Members of congress, and
hackers. I spent 17 years, count

00:00:50.050,00:00:55.055
that, as a member of congress,
that’s 10,001 in binary. And
sometimes it’s- felt like 10,001

00:01:00.894,00:01:05.899
years. I left uh in 2011 to head
the Wilson Center, many of you
may know it. And if you don’t,

00:01:09.803,00:01:14.808
what you need to know is that at
this Con, are 15 senior staffers
to members of congress plus

00:01:19.046,00:01:25.719
these members, ss- senior
staffers who have come here,
some Republica, some Democrats

00:01:25.719,00:01:32.626
all mixed up to learn from this
amazing Con, and this amazing
audience. So thank you for

00:01:32.626,00:01:37.631
teaching them. [applause] Over
my years in congress, my 10,001
years in congress, I learned

00:01:44.438,00:01:49.443
that politics is uh analog but
the world and the problems
politicians confront is digital.

00:01:56.249,00:02:02.889
Some politicians are worse
offenders than others, these
guys get it, but a whole bunch

00:02:02.889,00:02:08.428
of folks I think they’re still
out there in the United States
Congress are still using flip

00:02:08.428,00:02:13.433
phones. And we are here today to
see whether the hackers in
congress, the hackers and uh

00:02:17.404,00:02:24.211
some of the more uh advanced
people in congress, can help
bridge the divide. Trillions of

00:02:24.211,00:02:29.416
dollars are being lost to
breaches and destructive cyber
attacks as you all know plus

00:02:29.416,00:02:34.421
lives are being put at risk if
critical services are cut off by
bad actors. 30,000 people are

00:02:37.491,00:02:42.496
here uh at this Con with a keen
interest in hacking and in many
cases with extraordinary skills.

00:02:45.365,00:02:50.370
The US congress needs you! Uh
today we’re going to try to hack
congress in 45 minutes. Probably

00:02:54.408,00:02:59.413
would take a lot less than that.
And to explain [laughter] how
you can help. And uh if we don’t

00:03:03.083,00:03:08.088
work now to translate between
the traditional silos of our 2
communities then we will miss

00:03:10.157,00:03:15.162
opportunities, you know this, to
consider what solutions exist.
No one solves problems in

00:03:18.331,00:03:25.305
isolation. Something this
amazing community knows. So
before you right surrounding me

00:03:25.305,00:03:30.310
sit 2 real life current members
of congress. Jim Langevin right
here, dear friend of mine, is a

00:03:37.084,00:03:42.089
DEFCON repeater. Get that. From
Rhode Island’s 2nd congressional
district [applause]. And Ted

00:03:48.762,00:03:55.135
Lieu on my left a media star,
you see him all the time, is
from California’s 33rd, [cheers]

00:03:55.135,00:04:00.073
yay Ted! [applause]
Congressional district.
[applause] Uh this crowd has no,

00:04:02.742,00:04:09.015
no [laughs] this is great. Uh
Jim and I served together in the
house through the dark days and

00:04:09.015,00:04:14.721
they were after 9/11. He
currently sits on the House
Armed Services Committee, the

00:04:14.721,00:04:20.627
Homeland Security Committee, and
he previously served on the
House Intelligence Committee.

00:04:20.627,00:04:25.966
He’s known for his efforts to
improve America’s cyber security
enterprise, co founder and co

00:04:25.966,00:04:31.404
chair of the bipartisan
congressional CyberSecurity
caucus and he’s authored

00:04:31.404,00:04:36.776
numerous bills to protect
personal data and improve our
government’s coordination

00:04:36.776,00:04:43.016
efforts against cyber attacks.
That’s what we’re going to talk
about. Ted Lieu is also a member

00:04:43.016,00:04:47.821
of the congressional
CyberSecurity caucus, he
represents the South Bay of Los

00:04:47.821,00:04:52.826
Angeles uh which is m- the- m-
where most of the aerospace in-
in uh California is. And guess

00:04:56.129,00:05:01.067
what? It- most of that was my
former congressional district.
So yay for Ted. Uh a lot of

00:05:03.270,00:05:08.275
technology is developed there as
I said and I remember uh ba-
about 20 years ago or so meeting

00:05:10.443,00:05:15.448
a kid named Elon who was making
rockets on the saw dust floor in
his rental in El Segundo. Um Ted

00:05:20.220,00:05:27.160
is 1 of the only 4 computer
scientists in congress. Get
that. There are 4. That’s better

00:05:27.160,00:05:32.165
than 0. And he’s a colonel in
the Air Force reserves. As an
added bonus, he’s a lawyer. Um

00:05:34.267,00:05:39.673
so am I so go ahead and boo. Um
[laughter] and a founding co
chair of the Congressional

00:05:39.673,00:05:44.678
Virtual Reality Ca- uh Caucus. I
actually think some of Congress
is virtual reality. Um side by

00:05:46.846,00:05:51.851
side these policy makers are 2
genuine hackers. Infosecjen and
SpaceRogue. Figure out who is

00:05:56.890,00:06:01.828
who. Jen Ellis is awesome. She
heads rapid7’s policy team and
dedicates most of her time to

00:06:06.366,00:06:11.705
helping government understand
information security issues.
Thank you for that from a

00:06:11.705,00:06:16.710
grateful nation. She uh records
a cool podcast, works to fix
problems in outdated laws, most

00:06:20.080,00:06:26.653
of them are outdated, and hosts
a killer party at DEFCON. I went
last night, thank you for

00:06:26.653,00:06:32.826
including me. SpaceRogue is a
security researcher whose
reputation precedes him. Today

00:06:32.826,00:06:39.666
he is Global Hacking Strategy
Lead for X Force Red. How do you
put that on a card? Or do you?

00:06:39.666,00:06:44.671
>>It’s a big card. >>Big card!
At IBM. Space please don’t hack
my iphone or if you do leave the

00:06:47.540,00:06:52.545
pictures of my grand kids. So uh
imagine this. Let’s get into it.
A massive destructiveware attack

00:06:57.717,00:07:02.656
diagnosed as ransomware similar
to notpetya shuts down hospitals
and train stations and pick

00:07:05.425,00:07:11.164
whatever you want uh across
either of your congressional
districts and costs companies

00:07:11.164,00:07:16.169
there billions of dollars. Uh or
a horrible twist. A domestic
terrorist, and we certainly have

00:07:18.471,00:07:23.143
learned about that if we didn’t
already know about it, could
shoot up a shopping mall at home

00:07:23.143,00:07:29.616
while carrying out a denial of
service attack on the mall’s
phone infrastructure. So let’s

00:07:29.616,00:07:36.556
start with our congress people.
What do you do if that happens
all of that part of that, as a

00:07:36.556,00:07:41.561
member of congress? Who do you
call? And what happens? Jim.
>>Well Jane first of all I want

00:07:44.431,00:07:50.303
to thank you and the uh the
Wilson Center for hosting us
here today. I am a re- DEFCON

00:07:50.303,00:07:55.442
repeater and I’m thrilled uh to
be back. I was here 2 years ago
and thoroughly enjoyed the

00:07:55.442,00:08:01.314
experience. Uh importantly I
learned a lot and it gave me the
opportunity to engage with some

00:08:01.314,00:08:05.985
uh really talented cyber
researchers and uh- uh I
appreciate the time spent then

00:08:05.985,00:08:12.359
and the opportunity to be back
now and to uh to be with my
colleague uh Ted Lieu and uh

00:08:12.359,00:08:17.497
together 1 of the- the handful
of few that- uh that really gets
cyber security and- and how

00:08:17.497,00:08:23.269
important it is to the country.
And honored to be here with the
panelists and uh Jane again uh

00:08:23.269,00:08:27.340
thank you for your leadership at
the Wilson Center. Jane and I
served in congress as she

00:08:27.340,00:08:32.212
mentioned for- for many years
and we have uh nothing but the
deepest respect for Jane Harman

00:08:32.212,00:08:36.783
and uh and it was a loss to the
congress when she left. Jane
anytime you want to come back,

00:08:36.783,00:08:41.054
the water is fine, come on back.
So, gotta give it another shot.
>>I’d rather come back to- I’d

00:08:41.054,00:08:44.958
rather come back to DEFCON.
[laughter] >>True. Yeah.
[applause] So let- let me say

00:08:44.958,00:08:49.963
this. We would hope that the
right processes right now are in
place that we would have uh a

00:08:54.868,00:09:00.273
whole government a whole nation
response to a major cyber
incident. That would be uh in

00:09:00.273,00:09:05.278
many ways so uh you know we have
to wait to wait to be seen. We
there- after the uh- uh- -

00:09:07.347,00:09:12.352
several high profile uh cyber
intrusions or hacks that took
place uh there was a process put

00:09:14.587,00:09:20.560
together, PPD41 under President
Obama that basically laid out
what would happen if there were

00:09:20.560,00:09:25.665
ever a need for a- a national
incident re- incident response
team to be put together. And so

00:09:25.665,00:09:31.538
there is- the the policy is in
place. Now whether it can be uh
effectively executed, bringing

00:09:31.538,00:09:38.445
all the entities together and
without in fighting is, sort of,
we'd have to hope for the best

00:09:38.445,00:09:43.216
but we need to practice it.
That’s the- the key thing, it
needs to be exercised and

00:09:43.216,00:09:48.621
drilled over and over again. Now
the closest thing we have that
uh that took place was un

00:09:48.621,00:09:54.727
clearly after the 2016 elections
where we were totally caught off
guard by the degree to which the

00:09:54.727,00:10:00.233
Russians would interfere with
our elections. We were not
caught out- off guard in 2018.

00:10:00.233,00:10:04.804
We did have a more of a whole of
nation, a more whole of
government response um put in

00:10:04.804,00:10:09.809
place and uh we were much better
protected in 2018 but not
perfect; it’s still a work in

00:10:12.245,00:10:17.517
progress. The Russians we
believe will be back again in
2020 and there are further

00:10:17.517,00:10:22.822
preparations that are are put in
place that are ongoing right now
to make sure that we are

00:10:22.822,00:10:27.527
protecting our election system
and our infrastructure going
forward. That being said, the

00:10:27.527,00:10:32.866
last thing- I’ll- I’ll wind up
with this. We now though have to
be able to take that- that whole

00:10:32.866,00:10:39.672
of government response and we
also need to make sure that it’s
it would apply in other areas of

00:10:39.672,00:10:46.212
national incident uh uh of great
consequence so that we would be
able to recover uh and uh build

00:10:46.212,00:10:51.618
resilience by- to make sure that
we are exercising this so that
it becomes uh real strong muscle

00:10:51.618,00:10:56.623
memory. >>Well so Ted just to
uh- ask you to add to that
answer. Uh on 9/11 when Jim and

00:10:59.392,00:11:05.465
I were serving in congress, I
was walking toward the capitol
in the morning, my cell phone,

00:11:05.465,00:11:10.470
yes I had 1 not a flip phone, uh
rang and I was told uh the
capitol and the office buildings

00:11:12.505,00:11:18.344
have been evacuated. Congress is
closed, if you can imagine this.
We all take an oath to defend

00:11:18.344,00:11:25.185
the country but, hey, congress
is closed! There was no
evacuation plan. 250 members

00:11:25.185,00:11:31.224
plus were milling around in
front of the capitol, uh trying
to figure out what our next act

00:11:31.224,00:11:36.362
was. I was then the senior
Democrat on the House
Intelligence Committee. That’s a

00:11:36.362,00:11:41.534
job Adam Schiff had for a long
time before he became the
chairman. And we rounded up some

00:11:41.534,00:11:46.272
of the members, we went into 1
guy’s apartment which was on the
hill, a basement apartment, and

00:11:46.272,00:11:52.045
then we figured out we ought to
do 2 things. 1 we ought to mass
at the headquarters which were-

00:11:52.045,00:11:58.051
were then close by of the uh
capitol police to see if we
could get secure comps and be

00:11:58.051,00:12:03.189
helpful and the other thing we
ought to work on is getting the
capitol opened so that congress

00:12:03.189,00:12:08.494
would be available uh to protect
and at least serve the American
people during the worst day uh

00:12:08.494,00:12:13.499
in modern history. So Ted, now
that you’ve heard that lovely
story- >>Right. >>Is congress

00:12:13.499,00:12:19.906
prepared now for the kind of
cyber incident that I was
talking about. >>Uh no, we are

00:12:19.906,00:12:24.911
not. [laughter] Uh let me first
say uh I’m thrilled to be here.
Uh the only uh inaccuracy uh in

00:12:27.547,00:12:31.584
that introduction is that I’m a
recovering computer science
major, just want to put that out

00:12:31.584,00:12:37.056
there. [laughter] Um I’m honored
to be here with uh Jane Harman.
Uh much of what I know on

00:12:37.056,00:12:41.227
congress, I learned from
watching Jane Harman who was an
amazing member of congress. So

00:12:41.227,00:12:46.032
uh thank you uh for being my
mentor and Congressmen Jim
Langevin uh he mentioned this

00:12:46.032,00:12:51.037
whole government approach. Uh
when a crisis hits, uh it is
generally too late uh for

00:12:51.037,00:12:56.242
congress to act. Uh we are not
executory branch, uh we don’t
sort of take uh immediate

00:12:56.242,00:13:01.581
action, we pass laws and we do
oversight, none of which is
speedy or fast or quick. But

00:13:01.581,00:13:07.987
what we can do is try to set up
conditions and to uh put in laws
that mitigate any future crisis.

00:13:07.987,00:13:13.459
Uh that’s 1 reason uh that uh
Jim Langevin and I are uh co
authoring a bill to establish a

00:13:13.459,00:13:19.532
White House uh Cyber uh Security
uh czar. If you look at how we
do cyber in the federal

00:13:19.532,00:13:24.103
government, uh it is pretty
messed up. Uh you’ve got the
Department of Homeland Security

00:13:24.103,00:13:28.441
that’s sort of involved, then
you’ve got our DOD that’s sort
of involved, then you’ve got who

00:13:28.441,00:13:31.778
knows why the Office of
Management and Budget who is
sort of involved, then you’ve

00:13:31.778,00:13:36.182
got the White House which is
sort of involved, and you sort
of have the NFC who was involved

00:13:36.182,00:13:40.253
and then they eliminated the
national security- or their
cyber security person. So it is

00:13:40.253,00:13:44.424
all over the place. And if we
could centralize a single point
of contact, I think that would

00:13:44.424,00:13:51.030
make things easier. Uh in
addition when you sort of look
at uh our cyber security at

00:13:51.030,00:13:56.035
least at the federal level, uh
we’re very weak. Um SpaceRogue
testified in 1998- >>Yep >>About

00:13:58.571,00:14:05.211
how weak cyber security was. Uh
nearly 20 years later uh we were
still there. I remember being in

00:14:05.211,00:14:11.050
the House Oversight Committee
when uh we discovered this
massive breach of security

00:14:11.050,00:14:17.724
clearance forms from the federal
government. Nearly 20 million of
these documents uh were stolen

00:14:17.724,00:14:22.261
from a foreign country, all the
reporting is it was likely
China. These are extremely

00:14:22.261,00:14:28.801
sensitive forms known as SF86
forms. Uh I filled them out when
I was in the military. They ask

00:14:28.801,00:14:32.038
you everything under the sun.
Every bad thing you’ve ever
done, every person you’ve ever

00:14:32.038,00:14:37.043
met that’s a foreign person. It
is a treasure trove of
blackmail. And now there’s 20

00:14:37.043,00:14:41.380
million of these records
floating around and so our
national security suffered a

00:14:41.380,00:14:47.386
pretty significant hit not
because of any kinetic attack on
us but because there was a cyber

00:14:47.386,00:14:54.327
intrusion. And it was- the cyber
security standards are so weak
that the Inspector General’s

00:14:54.327,00:14:58.297
office, which was inspecting
these agencies, actually started
doing this report saying

00:14:58.297,00:15:03.836
“Please, increase your cyber
security.” And their last report
said essentially “Shut down some

00:15:03.836,00:15:08.074
of your systems because you
can’t protect them.”
Unfortunately, the Director of

00:15:08.074,00:15:12.411
the Office of Personnel
Management did not do that, and
we had this massive intrusion.

00:15:12.411,00:15:17.383
The other thing that we did is
when you look at it, why would
the Office of Personnel

00:15:17.383,00:15:23.489
Management, which was
essentially a human resources
agency, protect what’s known as

00:15:23.489,00:15:27.760
the Crown Jewels of American
national intelligence? It’d be
like asking the Department of

00:15:27.760,00:15:31.998
Agriculture to protect our
nuclear launch codes, really
stupid. So I worked with

00:15:31.998,00:15:36.135
congressman Steve Russelton, a
Republican out of Oklahoma and
we went to Obama’s

00:15:36.135,00:15:39.939
administration and says- and
said “You’ve gotta move this
database out of there.” They did

00:15:39.939,00:15:43.109
this whole investigative review,
they came back a few months
later and s- and agreed with us

00:15:43.109,00:15:47.346
and now it’s being protected by
US cyber command uh in a much
better place. So these are some

00:15:47.346,00:15:51.417
things we can do in Congress to
try to mitigate future crisis,
but when the crisis actually

00:15:51.417,00:15:56.422
hits, there is very little
Congress can do. >>So Jen uh
what if I turned on my cell

00:15:59.225,00:16:06.132
phone later, it’s off for now-
>>Ha! >>And I have received a
call from President Donald Trump

00:16:06.132,00:16:11.137
and he’s asking me to find
someone really smart, in fact
some 2 people really smart to

00:16:13.139,00:16:18.144
advise him on what the federal
government should do right now.
Uh to protect itself. Uh what do

00:16:20.847,00:16:27.587
you tell our President?
>>[clears throat] Where do I
start with that question? Uh

00:16:27.587,00:16:31.858
firstly I’d just like to say
hacking congress in 45 minutes
was not a challenge guys, so

00:16:31.858,00:16:36.863
don’t get ideas, please.
[chuckles] Um [laughs] I uh I
mean I think- I think that when

00:16:39.699,00:16:45.504
every anybody is asked uh where
do you start on how to secure-
secure yourself and move forward

00:16:45.504,00:16:51.844
it’s a super complex question,
and it’s a multi layered
question. Um, I think that the

00:16:51.844,00:16:56.482
the first thing that you do is
you bring as many sort of smart
informed people together as

00:16:56.482,00:17:01.888
possible and you have them
educate each other, listen to
each other, identify what the

00:17:01.888,00:17:05.191
problem sets are, prioritize
them, figure out what the right
solutions are- >>But, but this

00:17:05.191,00:17:09.629
is Donald Trump we’re talking
about. He doesn’t have
[laughter] a lot of time for

00:17:09.629,00:17:14.066
this. Uh think about his
Presidential daily brief, which
he doesn’t have a lot of time

00:17:14.066,00:17:20.239
for, so uh you’ve heard from
both of these people uh very
informed members of congress

00:17:20.239,00:17:25.344
some of the steps congress is
taking. You’re on a phone call-
>>Yeah. >>You’ve got your 5

00:17:25.344,00:17:27.346
minutes- >>And what’s the 1
thing? >>What do you say? Yeah.
>>What is the number 1 thing?

00:17:27.346,00:17:29.348
Yeah. [laughs] >>So I- I think 1
thing that- that we see at least
with this administration uh that

00:17:29.348,00:17:34.353
I have seen is that cyber and
yes I’m gonna use the C word,
[laughter] because it’s

00:17:40.793,00:17:46.532
appropriate here uh in this
context uh that cyber in DC
right now isn’t really taken as

00:17:46.532,00:17:52.071
a priority so I would probably
advise the President that uh
there needs to be a higher focus

00:17:52.071,00:17:56.976
and a closer look at what cyber
is and how we can fix it and
let’s put some dollars into it

00:17:56.976,00:18:01.314
and some people and see where
the problems are and how we can
fix them. >>But 1 of the recent

00:18:01.314,00:18:07.753
steps he took you heard this
from our- our members is he
downgraded the cyber job in the

00:18:07.753,00:18:13.826
White House. Uh it was held by
a- a man named Tom Bossert, who
is pretty smart on cyber my

00:18:13.826,00:18:18.230
impression certainly, he’s now
gone into the private sector,
but not only did Bossert get

00:18:18.230,00:18:22.835
fired, but his job was
abolished. And I think the
number of dollars, I don’t know

00:18:22.835,00:18:27.840
folks, spent on cyber protection
in the government has gone down
in real terms. Has it? >>Well

00:18:30.543,00:18:37.083
it’s still in the- in the
billions but not uh nearly uh
enough and- and I think we need

00:18:37.083,00:18:43.856
to do more in terms of building
up expertise within uh within
DHS and not just relying on

00:18:43.856,00:18:49.628
reach back from- from other
agencies. But the other thing
that we need to do I believe is

00:18:49.628,00:18:54.567
uh again engage more with the
cyber security research
community. I’ve learned a lot by

00:18:54.567,00:19:00.940
coming to- to DEFCON and
understanding that uh the the
the hackers uh they like to

00:19:00.940,00:19:05.678
break things but they like to do
it so that they can fix them and
make- >>Yeah! >>The internet uh

00:19:05.678,00:19:10.516
work better. And that’s where
we’re-we need to draw on that
strength and leverage it as a

00:19:10.516,00:19:16.088
country. >>So Jen, how do you
bottle DEFCON? >>So I, [laughs]
that’s a great question uh

00:19:16.088,00:19:20.626
they’re all the totals. Um I- I
would just say like quickly that
while I do think resourcing

00:19:20.626,00:19:24.764
security appropriately and
giving it a mandate is
essential, uh I agree with

00:19:24.764,00:19:28.734
representative Lieu that 1 of
the challenges we have is
there’s a sort of a chaotic

00:19:28.734,00:19:32.438
approach. There's like a
scattered approach and there’s
too many different voices

00:19:32.438,00:19:37.576
involved. And like I would worry
with this sort of uh you know
Trumpian view of like just give

00:19:37.576,00:19:42.148
it money and tell them to go
that uh we’re not gonna have a
lot of strategy in how we go

00:19:42.148,00:19:48.888
about it. I think having a
centralized voice that is an
expert on this area is- is a- uh

00:19:48.888,00:19:53.893
a good idea. And I think that
you know to to um to Congressman
Langevin’s point, if we can have

00:19:56.395,00:20:02.702
that group work with this group
you know as you say bottling the
security researchers and have

00:20:02.702,00:20:07.606
the researchers providing the
appropriate level of input in,
where are the real risks? How do

00:20:07.606,00:20:12.178
we uh how do we address those?
What needs to be prioritized?
That’s when I think you make

00:20:12.178,00:20:18.951
progress. >>So wh- 1 way that
we’re trying to engage the
hacking community is to ask

00:20:18.951,00:20:24.423
folks who are interested uh to
help hack the federal
government. And so I introduced

00:20:24.423,00:20:29.428
a bill with congressmen uh
Taylor, a Republican out of
Virginia, it’s called the Hack

00:20:29.428,00:20:33.399
the Department of Homeland
Security Act. It was signed into
law earlier this year, it

00:20:33.399,00:20:38.404
required uh DHS to do 2 things.
1 was to uh make an assessment
of uh cyber vulnerabilities and

00:20:40.439,00:20:45.444
second uh to create a bug bounty
program to pay uh white hat
hackers to hack DHS and to tell

00:20:47.513,00:20:53.586
them what was wrong with the
agency and to hopefully uh fix
those bugs. And so um if you are

00:20:53.586,00:20:59.759
interested uh contact DHS and
and see if if you can help them.
>>Well there are 2 good things

00:20:59.759,00:21:05.464
about what you just said Ted. 1
is you actually got something
passed on a bipartisan basis,

00:21:05.464,00:21:11.337
and 2 is uh it will probably do
some good. So those are you
know, we’re building back

00:21:11.337,00:21:16.342
Congress is what I have to say.
>>And I should mention
[applause] that we’ve already

00:21:20.112,00:21:25.117
seen a uh a the uh the hacking
program uh be successful. When
Ash Carter was Secretary of

00:21:27.253,00:21:32.491
Defense, I sort of applauded and
encouraged the Hack uh the
Pentagon program, which was

00:21:32.491,00:21:37.496
wildly successful. Uh with that
and GSA and as a result uh Kevin
McCarthy and I on a bipartisan

00:21:40.432,00:21:45.437
basis put through a uh uh a a-
bill that requires DHS now to
have a vulnerability disclosure

00:21:48.440,00:21:53.078
program and- and processes that
I would like to eventually see
every department and agency

00:21:53.078,00:21:58.684
having a similar type of a
policy uh put in place. And I’m
feeling more and more confident

00:21:58.684,00:22:04.456
that- that we will. >>So hanging
out here yesterday with all
these brilliant staffers from

00:22:04.456,00:22:10.229
congress, we were briefed by
various folks and 2 things were
mentioned er many- many more

00:22:10.229,00:22:15.234
things. But 1 is that failure is
good, uh failure is your friend
you learn well hopefully you

00:22:17.636,00:22:22.708
learn from failure, you don’t
just keep failing. Uh you can
fail upward and you can become

00:22:22.708,00:22:29.548
smarter. That was 1. And the
other word that I never hear in
government was imagination. Uh

00:22:29.548,00:22:34.553
using imagination uh is the way
we uh anticipate things that can
go wrong, get ahead of the- of

00:22:38.357,00:22:43.495
those who are really trying to
hurt us. So let me ask the
members of congress uh about

00:22:43.495,00:22:48.500
those 2 worlds, words. Um does
our government uh is it ok in
government to fail to learn from

00:22:51.203,00:22:56.208
failures, and where is the
imagination in government about
things like uh cyber? >>Well

00:23:00.112,00:23:05.985
you’re right on point that if-
if uh you you don’t fail you
don’t learn. It’s gotta be smart

00:23:05.985,00:23:12.157
failure, and I mean and this is-
is somewhat related to my
defense world. And uh the sub

00:23:12.157,00:23:17.296
committee that I chair on
intelligence emerging threats
and capabilities that you need

00:23:17.296,00:23:23.202
to l- look at failure as an
opportunity to to learn. You
have to force your culture of uh

00:23:23.202,00:23:29.441
trying things, risk taking, but
uh- uh not penalizing failure
but- but uh, in a sense,

00:23:29.441,00:23:34.580
rewarding it or at least
building it a culture. And that
goes for- uh for cyber as well.

00:23:34.580,00:23:38.784
You don’t learn these things
unless we exercise them, that we
plan. It’s not something you can

00:23:38.784,00:23:45.090
just hope is gonna work out, it
has to be uh thought through,
exercised, and that’s why either

00:23:45.090,00:23:51.897
war gaming or- or- or planning
is so- is so important. >>1
reason I read science fiction is

00:23:51.897,00:23:58.537
for the imagination. At least
that’s what I tell people. Um so
in terms of Congress- >>I think

00:23:58.537,00:24:03.942
it’s to change the subject and
get your mind off your day job.
>>[laughs] So in terms of uh

00:24:03.942,00:24:08.480
imagination uh I think Jane
makes a great point that
government certainly doesn't do

00:24:08.480,00:24:12.651
enough of that. But even before
we get there, just want to
understand sort of what congress

00:24:12.651,00:24:16.822
is like, uh members of congress
don’t really walk around
thinking about

00:24:16.822,00:24:22.027
encryption.[laughter] That’s not
something they do! >>What? >>So
you're faced with you know every

00:24:22.027,00:24:28.233
2 years with these 2 election
cycles, we vote ov- well over
1,000 times. Uh and um 80, 90

00:24:28.233,00:24:32.304
percent of those votes, we don’t
get a single phone call,
message, email, or a meeting.

00:24:32.304,00:24:37.476
And then uh you’re asked to vote
on all these different things
from um you know issues you have

00:24:37.476,00:24:42.715
no idea about to issues you care
a lot about so there’s not a lot
of time uh on cyber unless you

00:24:42.715,00:24:47.753
put it directly in front of a
member of Congress or their
staff. So it’s important to have

00:24:47.753,00:24:50.889
conferences like DEFCON that
raise awareness and then when
people read about things in the

00:24:50.889,00:24:56.395
press they might go “Oh that’s
sort of interesting.” And uh 1
way to try to get more um

00:24:56.395,00:25:01.600
imagination in government is to
just let people even know this
problem exists so that members

00:25:01.600,00:25:07.873
of congress and their staff uh
start thinking about it. >>Yeah
so SpaceRogue you testified 21

00:25:07.873,00:25:14.380
years ago, oh my God. >>Ah, I’m
old! >>No that doesn’t make you
old. [laughter] Not at all. Not

00:25:14.380,00:25:21.320
to me! >>Yeah I was 15 then.
>>Yeah you were 15. Me too.
[laughter] So you testified 21

00:25:21.320,00:25:26.325
years ago, what was the
sophistication of the crowd you
addressed and do you think

00:25:29.294,00:25:35.567
congress is trying through all
the tasks that members have to
do and what I would call the

00:25:35.567,00:25:42.040
perpetuel reelection campaign,
uh do you think that Congress is
trying to become more

00:25:42.040,00:25:47.212
sophisticated and aware? >>Um
well the pan- the the uh the
committee that I addressed then

00:25:47.212,00:25:49.548
was actually pretty
sophisticated right it had
Senator Glenn, who was an

00:25:49.548,00:25:54.887
astronaut. Senator Thompson, um
Senator Leiberman, all very
sophisticated people. >>None of

00:25:54.887,00:25:59.992
them is there anymore. >>None of
them are there anymore!
[laughter] Um and but the

00:25:59.992,00:26:04.430
current the current
administration or the current
congress people that I see uh

00:26:04.430,00:26:09.168
want to be sophisticated. Uh
they want to be knowledgeable,
they want to understand the

00:26:09.168,00:26:13.806
issues, uh but the I mean as we
all know some of these issues
are fairly complex and that’s

00:26:13.806,00:26:18.410
why they have their staffers to
sort of research this stuff for
them, uh and it’s up to us as a

00:26:18.410,00:26:23.215
community uh to engage with
those agencies and those people
and those staffers and those

00:26:23.215,00:26:28.220
congresspeople to educate them
and as- as Representative Lieu
has said, he- he’s not getting

00:26:28.220,00:26:32.458
letters from many of the bills
that he’s voting on. Why aren't
we writing letters? Why aren’t

00:26:32.458,00:26:36.562
we telling them that we’re
saying we’re here, we’re
available, we’re knowledgeable

00:26:36.562,00:26:41.800
uh you know look at this issue
in this way, here’s something
you may not have thought about.

00:26:41.800,00:26:46.271
Whatever, get engaged, uh write
those letters, make congress
more uh technical so that they

00:26:46.271,00:26:50.742
understand the issues that
they’re voting on. >>Can I, can
I? >>Yeah. >>Um can I ask the

00:26:50.742,00:26:54.713
audience questions? Show of
hands sorry I really like
audience participation because I

00:26:54.713,00:27:00.886
don’t see why I should do all
the work. Um so quick show of
hands uh who feels like they’re

00:27:00.886,00:27:04.857
pretty confident what Congress
is doing around cyber security,
like what issues they're focused

00:27:04.857,00:27:09.862
on? Like I- I’m somewhat
confident on it, k. Um who feels
like they know what they’re

00:27:13.265,00:27:17.603
local representation thinks
about cyber security, like if
they have a point of view on it,

00:27:17.603,00:27:23.208
what they’re platform is, what
they focus on. Ok a little-
little bit more. Yes. Umm.

00:27:23.208,00:27:28.213
>>This is pathetic folks.
>>[laughs] Um ok uh who would
actually have an interest in

00:27:30.482,00:27:34.086
helping to shape better cyber
security policy? >>Thank you.
>>Look at that! >>Thank you!

00:27:34.086,00:27:38.557
>>Ok well so firstly that’s,
that’s awesome, that’s really
great like we love that. You

00:27:38.557,00:27:45.130
should totally get involved. Um
and uh I think you know 1 thing
that I would love to like sort

00:27:45.130,00:27:50.269
of talk about is how you can get
involved. Um and I- I do think-
I mean ‘cause I think it’s

00:27:50.269,00:27:53.906
really- it’s really challenging
and it’s like a little daunting-
>>So talk about that, alright?

00:27:53.906,00:28:00.612
>>Yeah. >>How- how can they get
involved? This is from uh an
experienced uh hacker slash

00:28:00.612,00:28:05.951
policy wonk. That’ll be you.
>>[laughs] Ok. Um and I’ll say
like when I started doing policy

00:28:05.951,00:28:12.691
work um I you can hear in my
accent, I’m not American. I had
no idea. I’m not a lawyer, I’m

00:28:12.691,00:28:17.696
not a policy person, I knew
nothing whatseover um I still
think I know nothing and yet

00:28:17.696,00:28:23.635
somehow I’m sitting here which
is a little bit awkward. Um so
what I did was um I so firstly I

00:28:23.635,00:28:28.674
talked to other people who were
interested. So I went online and
I looked at who’s talking about

00:28:28.674,00:28:32.311
certain topics and introduced
myself to them. Figure out what
the topics are that you care

00:28:32.311,00:28:38.116
about. For me uh the thing that
got me like angry was a really
close friend of mine that’s a

00:28:38.116,00:28:43.055
security researcher got
threatened with legal action and
uh was completely legitimate

00:28:43.055,00:28:49.061
research and then I learned
about the CFAA. Um who loves the
CFAA? Yeah that’s what I

00:28:49.061,00:28:53.966
thought. >>Good. >>Fantastic. So
uh that was my issue was like I
was all uh fired up about the

00:28:53.966,00:28:59.738
CFAA so I went and figured out
who talks about the CFAA, who's
been working on that? Um and I

00:28:59.738,00:29:05.344
went and made friends with them.
And then I from those people I
figured out which particular

00:29:05.344,00:29:10.849
committees do things around um
crime and the Computer Forgeign
Abuse Act, so that was the

00:29:10.849,00:29:16.788
judiciary committees. So I
looked up who were on those
committees and I- I literally

00:29:16.788,00:29:21.193
just sort of reached out to the
offices of the people who were
on those committees and said

00:29:21.193,00:29:25.197
“You know I’d like to come and
talk to you about security.” And
what I found was when I sent

00:29:25.197,00:29:28.567
these emails people were like
“Oh cyber security? Yeah that’s
totally a thing we’re looking

00:29:28.567,00:29:32.537
at. Come in and talk to us.” And
then I kind of got inundated
with like: Can you talk about

00:29:32.537,00:29:35.107
encryption? Can you talk about
breach notification? Can you
talk about this that and the

00:29:35.107,00:29:40.178
other? Because they were
actually crying out for people
who could talk about cyber

00:29:40.178,00:29:45.050
security and was willing- were
willing to give the time. So
there’s real interest, all you

00:29:45.050,00:29:49.054
have to do is like do a bit of
research it is hard I’m not
trying to minimize it, it is-

00:29:49.054,00:29:54.292
it’s daunting. >>I mean it-
there’s also local government,
state, town, city. Uh don’t

00:29:54.292,00:29:58.030
forget them, they need just as
much information as the federal
government. If you don’t want to

00:29:58.030,00:30:02.200
work directly with government,
there are a lot of other
organizations that uh work with

00:30:02.200,00:30:06.271
government for you that you can
work with for example the- the
BAR association is trying to put

00:30:06.271,00:30:10.409
together a framework for
protecting security researchers.
So if you’re a lawyer and you

00:30:10.409,00:30:14.246
want to work on that you can uh
I don’t know- uh contact me I
guess. But there’s tons of

00:30:14.246,00:30:19.518
things that you can do to get
involved, and help uh, be
engaged. >>Alright so Josh

00:30:19.518,00:30:23.255
Corman is waggling his eyebrows
at me so I’m gonna say I Am the
Calvary is another great way of

00:30:23.255,00:30:26.792
getting involved. They do a lot
of great work with policy makers
and they can help keep you

00:30:26.792,00:30:31.196
informed. Uh so yeah, there are
several ways of doing it. >>So-
so let’s talk about something

00:30:31.196,00:30:36.968
that is absolutely critical to
our democracy, not that a lot of
this isn’t, but the 2000- the-

00:30:36.968,00:30:41.973
the 2020 election and whether or
not the answer is not, uh our
voting machines are secure. I

00:30:44.376,00:30:51.316
went yesterday with Jim uh to
the I guess it was the Voting
Village uh to get briefed and I

00:30:51.316,00:30:56.822
learned, not that you all don’t
know that, that a th- at least a
third of voting machines, espec-

00:30:56.822,00:31:02.728
the ones you push and that have
no paper trail, are totally
vulnerable. 1 third in this

00:31:02.728,00:31:09.301
country. 1 third. And there are
lots of efforts especially uh
huh in you know from this

00:31:09.301,00:31:15.607
audience uh to try to come up
with some ideas that are
affordable to election uh

00:31:15.607,00:31:20.912
districts and would add
security. How many of you, I
like this idea of show of hands,

00:31:20.912,00:31:25.917
if- if- even if not asked, how
many of you would like to work
on this problem? Well that’s

00:31:28.887,00:31:33.792
pretty good Jim. What do you-
what do you think? >>I think
it’s uh- I think it’s great. Uh

00:31:33.792,00:31:40.565
and the uh the vulnerability in
election systems uh does uh
concern me and uh especially

00:31:40.565,00:31:45.570
talking about uh touch screen
technology without uh a hard
copy paper uh paper ballot. So

00:31:47.939,00:31:52.778
this is an area where uh my
experience in government kind of
crosses a different a few

00:31:52.778,00:31:57.549
different domains sort of the
interest in cyber but I served
as Secretary of State Rhode

00:31:57.549,00:32:02.687
Island, I overhauled our
election system. I chaired a
special legislation- legislative

00:32:02.687,00:32:08.326
commission looking at different
technologies and I could never
get over uh the the feeling that

00:32:08.326,00:32:14.599
what if everything went south
and and yeah the somehow the
data was lost and not even

00:32:14.599,00:32:19.137
thinking about hacking at the
time, how do you recreate the
election? And instead of going

00:32:19.137,00:32:25.544
with- with touch screens we went
with an optical scan system. I
think that’s the- the best model

00:32:25.544,00:32:31.049
going forward but there are many
locations that have already
invested in this the- the touch

00:32:31.049,00:32:35.787
screen technology and they’re
not ready, willing or able to
transition over. That’s why I

00:32:35.787,00:32:41.726
think federal resources have to
be provided uh to states and
municipalities so that they can

00:32:41.726,00:32:47.999
purchase that- that new uh
equipment. But surely engaging
with the- the security community

00:32:47.999,00:32:53.038
is- is important, it’s
essential, and I can give a
couple of examples by the way

00:32:53.038,00:32:57.843
which already happened where
cyber security researchers had
an impact uh not election

00:32:57.843,00:33:04.382
focused but uh this is on the
Wassenaar Arrangement, in NTAAs,
uh multi-stakeholder process on

00:33:04.382,00:33:11.356
vulnerability disclosures, and
uh and also the FDA and uh their
uh pre and post market guidance

00:33:11.356,00:33:16.194
on medical devices. This is an
area where we- cyber researchers
in this community have already

00:33:16.194,00:33:22.300
had an impact by reaching out to
your- your- um your legislators
and- and people in the policy

00:33:22.300,00:33:28.640
world and you can help better
inform us as we make good public
policy. >>Ok. >>So- so 1 way to

00:33:28.640,00:33:35.547
uh make things better for
example in uh the voting area is
to simply make these machines

00:33:35.547,00:33:41.086
less susceptible to hacking. The
other way is to help pass laws
that will mandate these private

00:33:41.086,00:33:46.258
companies to do the right thing.
So the House of Representatives
on a bipartisan basis has passed

00:33:46.258,00:33:51.997
2 bills to US Senate. 1 is their
uh HR 1 for the People Act.
There’s a number of uh election

00:33:51.997,00:33:56.534
security measures in there. And
then we also passed the SAFE
Act, focused just on election

00:33:56.534,00:34:02.807
security. It does simple things
like require a paper trail. Uh
Senator Mitch Mconnell, er has

00:34:02.807,00:34:08.480
refused to take those bills up
for a vote. Uh and my view is
that uh Abraham Lincoln had it

00:34:08.480,00:34:13.518
right when he said that public
sentiment is everything. With
it, nothing can fail; without

00:34:13.518,00:34:18.924
it, nothing can succeed. >>So,
so let’s pause there. What Ted
just said translated in simple

00:34:18.924,00:34:24.729
sentences is the house has
passed a couple of very strong
bills and they are languishing

00:34:24.729,00:34:29.734
in the United States Senate. How
many of you live in places that
have- that have Senators?

00:34:32.904,00:34:39.611
[laughter] And what should you
now do? [crowd yells] Call your
Senator! >>Yes, yes. >>To get,

00:34:39.611,00:34:46.017
what- what are the numbers of
these bills, Ted? >> Oh 1 is
HR1, uh, the other is uh called

00:34:46.017,00:34:51.022
the SAFE Act. Uh so I want you
to understand your power to
shape public sentiment. So 1 way

00:34:54.259,00:35:00.365
is for example what Jane and uh
Jim just did yesterday and went
and saw this uh village, where

00:35:00.365,00:35:05.070
they’re hacking voting machines,
just letting the public know hey
these things can be hacked or

00:35:05.070,00:35:10.375
letting the press know and then
it puts pressure right on
senators to start taking action,

00:35:10.375,00:35:15.580
just making the issue rise
higher level in the public’s
awareness. So understand your

00:35:15.580,00:35:21.853
power to do that and if people
start reading uh voices of
hackers uh if they read people

00:35:21.853,00:35:25.290
with expertise talking about
these issues. I think that can
help change public sentiment.

00:35:25.290,00:35:30.695
>>So we’re almost out of time
but I did want to ask uh
SpaceRogue and Jen now that

00:35:30.695,00:35:35.700
you’ve heard uh some very uh I
think uh positive suggestions
from well informed members of

00:35:38.136,00:35:43.141
Congress, whether you are
optimistic that somehow this
divide between the hat- hacker

00:35:45.477,00:35:51.116
community and uh this analog uh
community called the United
States Congress, not these

00:35:51.116,00:35:56.121
members, uh can be breached? And
that you know what will you
personally do after this little

00:35:58.323,00:36:03.628
conversation uh to help get
everyone else involved? >>Uh
yeah I’m all- I’m optimistic.

00:36:03.628,00:36:07.132
I’ve been optimistic for the
last 20 years uh and I think
that’s 1 of the important

00:36:07.132,00:36:10.535
lessons that I’ve had to learn
and struggle with because you
know as hackers we want things

00:36:10.535,00:36:15.774
done now. Right. Ok I’m gonna
hack it, Ok it’s done. Uh
Congress and government and the

00:36:15.774,00:36:21.179
corporation I work for now it
doesn’t work that way. Uh they
do not work at the speed of

00:36:21.179,00:36:27.152
hack. And so it takes 20 years
to go from hackers at Congress
to Congress and DEFCON. Uh and

00:36:27.152,00:36:32.190
I’m still very optimistic, I’m
very happy that you all are
here, um and I am going to go

00:36:32.190,00:36:38.296
forward and hopefully continue
to encourage people to get
involved and be engaged. >>Last

00:36:38.296,00:36:41.599
word, Jen. >>Yeah, I mean
obviously we wouldn’t be up here
if we were gonna be like “No!

00:36:41.599,00:36:46.705
I’m pessimistic and boo!” So yes
I’m also optimistic and I’m
optimistic not just because we

00:36:46.705,00:36:52.310
have um the congressmen here but
also because of the number of
you who turned out to hear them

00:36:52.310,00:36:55.880
um and the number of you who put
your hands up saying that you
want to help shape uh policy in

00:36:55.880,00:37:00.151
the right way and that makes me
really optimistic. The thing
that I would say you know just

00:37:00.151,00:37:06.491
anyone to Space’s comment about
time is also that the way that
congress works is it’s sort of

00:37:06.491,00:37:11.463
an evolution. And we all in the
tech sector tend to live in a
bit of a binary world, we can be

00:37:11.463,00:37:16.301
a bit absolutist about things
and I think if you’re gonna
engage the thing to recognize is

00:37:16.301,00:37:22.073
it’s a process, it’s a journey,
you’ll make incremental
progress, it won’t be like 1 and

00:37:22.073,00:37:27.045
done. So try not to be too
absolutist as you approach it.
Um what am I gonna do? Well I

00:37:27.045,00:37:32.484
will say, if anybody wants help
in getting involved, come find
me, I’m InfoSecJen, I’m always

00:37:32.484,00:37:38.523
happy to help people. Um and I
Will see you guys in DC in 2
weeks. >>Yeah . Um great. Uh Jim

00:37:38.523,00:37:43.528
and Ted each has uh a word and
I’ll I’ll sign off before they
speak by saying um this is 1

00:37:47.398,00:37:52.403
community and it has to include
uh our political community. That
divide has to be crossed because

00:37:55.573,00:38:01.646
if it’s not crossed, think what
the consequences are. So please
help congress. Jim Langevin,

00:38:01.646,00:38:07.418
last word and then Ted Lieu.
>>Thank you Jane. I really
enjoyed the discussion and being

00:38:07.418,00:38:13.858
on the panel uh today with these
outstanding uh panelists and let
me just close by saying this. Um

00:38:13.858,00:38:19.964
if you take away nothing uh from
the panel uh discussion is that
you can get involved and have an

00:38:19.964,00:38:25.203
impact. I know it has to be
frustrating that you know when
you see a problem, you just want

00:38:25.203,00:38:30.208
it to be fixed and to do it
immediately and as technologists
often you can do that. Write a

00:38:30.208,00:38:35.213
program, fix the problem.
Unfortunately public policy
making doesn’t always work that

00:38:35.213,00:38:39.551
fast and it’s to our great
frustration. There’s many things
that if I were uh king for a day

00:38:39.551,00:38:45.223
I guess I would uh I could fix
overnight but the policy making
process can be so cumbersome and

00:38:45.223,00:38:51.596
difficult. But I will say this.
When in making good public
policy 3 things have to line up.

00:38:51.596,00:38:56.501
If a problem, a solution, and a
window of opportunity. They
don’t oft- often wind up uh

00:38:56.501,00:39:00.638
lining up easily or quickly but
when they do you have to be
willing to push it and ready to

00:39:00.638,00:39:06.177
push it across the finish line.
That’s where you can come in. I
would say right now uh get in

00:39:06.177,00:39:11.983
touch with your- your member of
Congress, House, you’re you’re-
the- you’re Senator, know their

00:39:11.983,00:39:16.821
staff’s. Ping them once or twice
a year, let them know that
you’re there as a resource.

00:39:16.821,00:39:20.625
We’ve got incredibly smart
people on our staff’s but they
don’t know everything. And we

00:39:20.625,00:39:26.064
can use more resources we can
use your expertise. We welcome
your input and your involvement

00:39:26.064,00:39:31.035
can make a huge difference.
Thank you. >>Well 15 really
smart uh congressional staffers

00:39:31.035,00:39:36.875
are at DEFCON and they’ll be
here uh through tomorrow so you
can find them and they work for

00:39:36.875,00:39:41.879
Republicans and Democrats across
the country in uh senior jobs so
uh be sure to lobby them. Ted,

00:39:44.716,00:39:50.221
the very last word. >>Thank you
so just 2 quick points uh. Not
only can you assist the federal

00:39:50.221,00:39:55.426
government, you can work on
issues that will help consumers.
So for example uh Jim Langevin

00:39:55.426,00:40:00.365
has introduced a bill on uh
notification for privacy
breaches. You’ve had companies

00:40:00.365,00:40:04.302
that have gotten breached, they
had the customer’s information
breached and then they didn’t

00:40:04.302,00:40:08.640
disclose it for weeks and weeks
and weeks and weeks and you had
consumers that couldn’t protect

00:40:08.640,00:40:12.977
themselves. Um so you can also
work on issues not just
affecting federal government but

00:40:12.977,00:40:18.182
affecting Americans in general.
And then let me conclude on
this. Um my view on politics is

00:40:18.182,00:40:23.187
that everything seems impossible
until it happens. So if 10 years
ago I were to tell you, hey in

00:40:25.256,00:40:28.960
10 years we’re gonna have gay
marriage in 50 states and in a
number of them were gonna be

00:40:28.960,00:40:34.032
smoking weed, you’de think I was
crazy! [laughter] That’s what’s
happening now, so you never know

00:40:34.032,00:40:38.002
when public sentiment shifts and
causes something to happen.
Thank you for being here. >>Uh

00:40:38.002,00:40:40.271
on that note thank you all for
coming. [applause]
