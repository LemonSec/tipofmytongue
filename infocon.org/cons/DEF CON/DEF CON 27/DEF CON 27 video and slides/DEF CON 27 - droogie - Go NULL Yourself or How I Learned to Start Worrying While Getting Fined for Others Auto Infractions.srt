>>Uh, this is uh Go Null

00:00:05.038,00:00:10.043
movies ever [audience laughs
whistles and clap] so, err, I am

little pocket dance Emelia's,

00:00:20.654,00:00:27.461
right? No, ummm, I hack things
for Ioactive I just wanna say
greets to the old school

00:00:27.461,00:00:33.133
telefreekers uh since back in
1992 since I was living between
payphone to payphone they felt

00:00:33.133,00:00:38.138
me out, so [speaker laughs,
audience laughs] so uh why this
talk, uh so I was hanging out

00:00:41.475,00:00:45.879
with my buddy Farm, we were
talking about like ummm stupid
umm you know famous hackers

00:00:45.879,00:00:51.285
tales, so you go to cons and
people tell you these, ss these
stories and half the time you

00:00:51.285,00:00:57.190
like whatever its bullsh*t other
times it’s totally lols, a lot
of times its victims of weird

00:00:57.190,00:01:04.064
computer bugs and umm sometimes
it’s totally real situations and
there is victims of these, these

00:01:04.064,00:01:07.701
bugs from unexpected data but
it’s totally validata and we
kinda have questions about, can

00:01:07.701,00:01:12.706
you, can you use totally
validata any scenarios and get
unexpected results and uh maybe

00:01:17.044,00:01:22.049
profitable uh wallsy results who
knows, so some observations umm,
everyones seen this before, umm,

00:01:26.553,00:01:31.558
yeah its a license plate cameras
umm, its err, you know somebody
attempting to do a SQL injection

00:01:33.760,00:01:39.466
with a license plate nah
[audience ] it's clearly a joke
like er ummm ya it wouldn’t work

00:01:39.466,00:01:44.171
I’m sorry to tell you, it would
not work umm, but it does bring
up some good points because are

00:01:44.171,00:01:51.011
these people actually thinking
about you know, that data as
being like attack surface, umm,

00:01:51.011,00:01:56.016
who knows but ya we’ve been a
little skeptic about it and umm
this is super sketch company uh

00:01:59.052,00:02:03.690
through this inherited can’t
really call them out uh its,
they basically uh data analytics

00:02:03.690,00:02:08.895
and they they are a surveillance
network on like all U S citizens
they like sketchy heap maps on

00:02:08.895,00:02:15.502
stuff and monitor all license
plate data and everything so umm
ya you can look up their manual

00:02:15.502,00:02:21.775
and see some some weird stuff if
you are interested, but here's
an example like they uh leak

00:02:21.775,00:02:26.279
their manual,err somebody leaks
their manual and you can see how
cops will go ahead and search

00:02:26.279,00:02:31.284
data up about people and query
like various LIP data basis uh
the DMV all sorts of stuff so

00:02:35.856,00:02:41.662
umm getting on to the FOIA its
the freedom of information act
basically lets you request from

00:02:41.662,00:02:46.666
uh federal agencies and uh far
as uh FOIA dude so uh he went
ahead and umm you know explained

00:02:51.938,00:02:56.176
some of it to me he kinda gave a
few little tips like just so you
know if you, if you going to

00:02:56.176,00:03:01.581
FOIA some stuff, umm they they
not gonna go ahead and get
something they don’t have you

00:03:01.581,00:03:04.918
can’t just say like umm go, go
fetch like like if they have it
they will give it to you, but

00:03:04.918,00:03:10.490
they not going to get something
you wan, that you want that they
don’t have right and also ask

00:03:10.490,00:03:14.761
for electronic delivery because
uh it can, it can cost some
money depending on what you

00:03:14.761,00:03:21.168
requesting but you read more
about at your heart's content,
but basically you want to head

00:03:21.168,00:03:27.574
your FOIA requests to the
Seattle police department ALPR
data base and uh in the state

00:03:27.574,00:03:33.680
there was like 80gigs or 100gigs
or something err, it had all
sorts of sh*t, umm all the

00:03:33.680,00:03:39.219
images umm all the location data
for the car that was scanned for
the car that did the scanning uh

00:03:39.219,00:03:45.292
umm the OCR data for wanna
analyse the the image and other
other weird anomalies and other

00:03:45.292,00:03:50.297
stuff we will get back to later
umm and they striped some some
sensitive stuff you know like

00:03:52.299,00:03:57.104
about like hot cars and what not
but they but they forgot a few
things you know like not really

00:03:57.104,00:04:01.374
important things like
credentials and stuff its no big
deal but umm, [audience laughs]

00:04:01.374,00:04:07.013
ya err, but here’s an example on
a on a cop car you know those
are the cameras and they will be

00:04:07.013,00:04:12.018
scanning plates so another
observation is that Mr. Null so
this is some dude and thats his

00:04:14.121,00:04:20.093
surname believe it or not and
umm he there is an article up
there you can can just google

00:04:20.093,00:04:25.232
and he had issues like
purchasing plane tickets and you
know people were like kinda

00:04:25.232,00:04:31.771
skeptic like, this guy is full
of it umm makes you wonder is
this a warn of issue did aah did

00:04:31.771,00:04:36.776
this happen back in 1992 with OG
telefreaker or did this happen
you know on 2019 umm it you know

00:04:41.381,00:04:48.121
huge difference like would it
happen today and ummm why did it
cause a bug the the value null

00:04:48.121,00:04:53.126
is different to the string null
so what the f*ck right and umm
it's kinda crazy so umm sorry

00:04:55.929,00:05:02.469
just a little bit of cringe well
I had to throw that in so uh so
I I think that the null story is

00:05:02.469,00:05:07.474
real, personally umm because I
see data validation issues every
single day and computers are

00:05:10.210,00:05:15.215
hard so I think that use cases
like this still exist and umm
makes us kinda of wonder are

00:05:17.817,00:05:22.289
there any other types of uh
areas where we could provide
data like this and maybe cause

00:05:22.289,00:05:28.695
issues or interesting outcomes
umm even though it is totally
valid and uh just uh just a

00:05:28.695,00:05:34.167
small note this is all fake that
I am telling you this, like the
way the story is going in

00:05:34.167,00:05:38.004
reality all I wanted was to
register a cool plate and I am
going to pretend that I did it

00:05:38.004,00:05:44.411
in this order just fyi [audience
noise] umm but in the united
states we can make vanity

00:05:44.411,00:05:50.350
license plates and there are
some rules, they can't be vulgar
sexual stuff like that and you

00:05:50.350,00:05:55.822
can't misrepo misrepresent law
enforcements so cant be like FBI
or something ummm there's some

00:05:55.822,00:06:00.760
examples of some cringy plates
and umm ya texas pride so
[audience noise] so lets

00:06:04.164,00:06:09.169
register a plate right ummm I go
to DMV website check if uh null
was there seen already I was

00:06:12.472,00:06:19.446
looking for a cool stuff you
know like uh I don't know like
zegfault right like null pointer

00:06:19.446,00:06:25.652
then I was like oh f*ck null I
should look that and umm it was
available I I expected the DMV

00:06:25.652,00:06:32.459
site just not allow it and crash
or error it or something cause
its a government website ummm

00:06:32.459,00:06:39.399
but like umm no bugs happen do
register like wait wait and we
will mail a plate to you and

00:06:39.399,00:06:44.404
cool lets let's wait and there
it is [audience laughs] so it's
pretty cute pretty cool plate

00:06:47.941,00:06:52.946
right and umm so uh profit umm
is it possible to be invisible
citations maybe will a cop go

00:06:55.315,00:07:00.253
ahead and uh try to try to scam
me and they will say like enter
real data enter enter [speaker

00:07:02.389,00:07:07.460
laughs] you know you must enter
something other than null like I
dont know like umm if they wrote

00:07:07.460,00:07:11.531
a ticket would it break
something I have no idea but
like time will tell will see if

00:07:11.531,00:07:18.071
I get tickets or not but so
unforeseen consequences uh a
beer to the first person who

00:07:18.071,00:07:24.010
calls out the a the a little
easter egg there the reference
[audience noise] who said that

00:07:24.010,00:07:29.215
come get the beer come get the
beer I dont have the beer I will
get it later [audience laughs]

00:07:29.215,00:07:34.587
ummm yeah half life of the sh*t
good man uh so I didn't get the
ticket for like a year cos I am

00:07:34.587,00:07:39.592
a good boy and um you and my
registration renewal come up so
you go to this ca DMV website

00:07:42.262,00:07:47.267
says enter the last 5 year vin
enter your license plate like
easy enough and oops it broke

00:07:51.938,00:07:55.842
[audience laughs] [speaker
laughs] so agh so I was able to
register the plate and get it

00:07:55.842,00:08:01.448
but I can’t reregister and of
cause I am like sh*t sh*t I have
to go to the DMV like nobody

00:08:01.448,00:08:07.721
wants to go the DMV uh like
people who say like the DMV is
not a big deal they they cuckoo

00:08:07.721,00:08:14.461
like when you live in LA the DMV
thats your whole day so um well
luckily I was able to use a

00:08:14.461,00:08:20.066
reference number I didn't need
to go and I registered it but
but cool so uh later on I ended

00:08:20.066,00:08:26.272
up getting a ticket so I go
ahead and grab it off my
windshield and its says null on

00:08:26.272,00:08:32.545
it sh*t you know uh it has a
citation number it has some info
for me to go ahead and pay the

00:08:32.545,00:08:37.984
ticket and I went ahead and paid
the it like a sucker and you
know and ummm clearly my

00:08:37.984,00:08:43.556
predictions are wrong there were
no issues I I did get a ticket
uh but atleast I have a cool

00:08:43.556,00:08:48.561
plate right so about a week
later I I open up the mail box
and I have a grip of envelopes

00:08:51.531,00:08:56.536
and uh and I open them up and
there are a lot of citations
[audience laughs] [speaker

00:09:01.775,00:09:05.779
laughs] [audience claps] um yeah
they they all addressed to me
but umm well er didn't know I

00:09:05.779,00:09:10.350
had a car Honda, Toyota,
Porsche, Mercedes you know
[inaudible] [speaker laughs]

00:09:10.350,00:09:16.055
I’ve I’m living big right so
errm so my prediction was really
wrong right because when I went

00:09:16.055,00:09:18.057
in there it was like I’m I’m not
gonna be able to get a ticket
I’m the sh*t like I’m invisible

00:09:18.057,00:09:20.060
but but instead I got all the
tickets [audience laughs] so
[speaker laughs] so yeah yeah so

00:09:20.060,00:09:25.899
this company I had to go and pay
and and you look up the ticket
number the citation processing

00:09:25.899,00:09:30.904
centre so it’s a private company
that happen to be based out of
New Port Beach California which

00:09:38.845,00:09:43.850
is totally coincidence I got my
ticket in New Port Beach and and
I was like why I am giving money

00:09:43.850,00:09:48.221
to like a P O box and I was
super weirded out turns out they
are stationed there and I drove

00:09:48.221,00:09:53.760
passed them all the time and
didn’t realize ummm you know
sketchy basically collection

00:09:53.760,00:10:00.233
agency for the government and um
you can go on their site and you
can do a query for a plate and a

00:10:00.233,00:10:05.238
state so I go ahead and query my
plate and the state of
California [audience laughs]

00:10:10.877,00:10:15.882
[speaker laughs] so [speaker
laughing] [audience laughing]
[audience claps] yeah fun

00:10:19.686,00:10:23.990
[audience laughs] so so I call
them up and you know at this
point its still fun right aah

00:10:23.990,00:10:29.496
its a bug [audience laughs] my
wife is pissed [audience
laughing] so [speaker laughs]

00:10:29.496,00:10:34.801
like you know she she thinks I
am actually gonna pay the money
she ha you know she like aah

00:10:34.801,00:10:37.637
[audience laughing] [speaker
laughing] and umm so I call this
guy and umm of course a total

00:10:37.637,00:10:42.142
d*ck hey I need a I got a got a
great story for you give me your
citation number no no man this

00:10:42.142,00:10:48.781
is more involved give me your
citation number ok umm which one
yeah [audience laughs] uh so I

00:10:48.781,00:10:53.786
go ahead umm and I gave him
everything and ummm he basically
says how do I know these aren’t

00:10:55.822,00:11:00.927
all you [audience laughing]
[speaker clears throat and
laughs] and and he wants me to

00:11:00.927,00:11:04.397
like show him all my
registration history and mail
everything back and uh I was

00:11:04.397,00:11:09.335
like I’m not mailing sh*t back
to you I’m keeping all this as
evidence of your mess up and er

00:11:09.335,00:11:16.242
umm it just didn’t really go
well my response was like
basically f*ck off like we’re

00:11:16.242,00:11:22.916
done here [audience laughs] is
that 10 ok perfect umm so uh
after our discussion I’m telling

00:11:22.916,00:11:25.818
my wife about it and I go ahead
and I am trying to explain to
her like um like this is

00:11:25.818,00:11:27.887
ridiculous like uh you know like
Cyprus college I don't go to
Cyprus college there’s uh pla

00:11:27.887,00:11:32.892
there is a car that got a ticket
at 11:00am there is a different
car that got a ticket at 13:00

00:11:38.131,00:11:43.937
pm like it’s clearly not me the
guy thinks I can change my
registration fast enough but

00:11:43.937,00:11:49.042
clearly wasn’t me I was wasn’t
worried about that, but after
the call I I go to show her look

00:11:49.042,00:11:53.479
here's here's the one I have
physically that was mailed to me
yeah I don't know if you can

00:11:53.479,00:11:58.484
read it but it says it’s a Honda
plate Null and I go look look I
will bring it up. Now it says it

00:12:00.486,00:12:05.491
is an Infinity and it has my VIN
nr [audience muffled] oohoohooa
so they changed the data to uh

00:12:07.927,00:12:13.399
basically make me look guilty
for these tickets umm because I
did tell the guy I don’t drive a

00:12:13.399,00:12:20.239
Honda I drive an Infinity so so
now their whole database is
basically points at me not all

00:12:20.239,00:12:25.244
of them, but a lot of them. So
uh are there any lawyers here
[audience laughs] because I am

00:12:29.215,00:12:33.386
[speaker laughs] because I don't
know if I have legal footing
Ummm but basically Ummm this is

00:12:33.386,00:12:38.391
bullsh*t [audience laughs] umm I
don’t know like I don't know the
impact right umm does this sync

00:12:41.527,00:12:46.699
with the police department does
this sync with the DMV Ummm are
there bench warrants for my

00:12:46.699,00:12:51.704
arrest am I Is my license going
to get suspended I have no idea
right so umm it also opens up a

00:12:53.840,00:12:58.811
ton of questions too like
potential for mis-conduct like
why why does a random employee

00:12:58.811,00:13:03.383
have right access to this you
know the cop writes the tickets
and sends it to them what

00:13:03.383,00:13:08.087
happens if it is a disgruntled
ex and they decided to load up
their ex with tickets and you

00:13:08.087,00:13:13.092
just guilty like there's nothing
Ummm can you social them can you
get them nah its an off by 1 you

00:13:15.595,00:13:20.600
know it was actually a 0 not a 1
like uh who knows it’s
ridiculous though right. So

00:13:23.169,00:13:29.976
there's poor solutions. So I
went to the LAPD and I said hey
man this is the situation and

00:13:29.976,00:13:34.981
the guy just like looking at me
and I’m just like I don’t
f*cking know [audience laughing]

00:13:34.981,00:13:40.353
[speaker laughs] he said change
your plate [audience laughs] I
said said no [audience laughs] I

00:13:40.353,00:13:45.525
didn't do anything wrong. So I
called the DMV and they said we
don't deal with citations we

00:13:45.525,00:13:51.130
only suspend you if someone asks
us too but you should change
your plate [audience laughing]

00:13:51.130,00:13:56.135
said no I didn't do anything
wrong. So I called the citation
processing center again and they

00:13:58.671,00:14:04.043
decide you better proof without
a doubt theses 100s of citations
are not yours, also you should

00:14:04.043,00:14:10.583
change your plate. [ audience
laughing] So I hang up right, so
I so I sent this tweet out don’t

00:14:10.583,00:14:15.588
know if you can read it. But it
basically says thanks cadmv you
idiots like nobody nobody has a

00:14:18.057,00:14:22.762
good solution you know its back
one there were gunny emojios
that sent like a different

00:14:22.762,00:14:28.000
message but apple changed this
now I am like squirting myself
with a squirt gun well it’s a

00:14:28.000,00:14:32.905
little silly if you look at it
now, but, but they actually
responded to me which is crazy

00:14:32.905,00:14:38.211
umm I don't know if its a PR
company or something but um they
contacted this company and they

00:14:38.211,00:14:43.082
actually voided out a bunch of
tickets and they were uh they
ended up sending me a email

00:14:43.082,00:14:46.786
she’s just like hey I‘m getting
this taking care of ummm I just
need you tell me which 1 of

00:14:46.786,00:14:51.791
these are actually yours
[audience laughs] so yeah and
umm so they didn’t actually fix

00:14:53.926,00:14:58.431
the issue they just voided out
said 0 dallars but but then it
just kinda started climbing up

00:14:58.431,00:15:03.369
of cause right so what uh are
some future possibilities umm so
clearly theres a total lack of

00:15:06.072,00:15:12.111
data entry ummm standards like
it’s just retarded so uh I
started going like like no cop

00:15:12.111,00:15:17.950
is running up to a car going
like aah there’s no plate I am
gonna go put a Null like so I

00:15:17.950,00:15:22.889
thought wha what is a totally
vaild plate that would that
would do this that I am missing

00:15:22.889,00:15:27.293
that’s a valid license plate you
could register that so I
searsched searched on their data

00:15:27.293,00:15:32.298
base for the word missing
tickets what about none tickets
no tags tickets [audience

00:15:36.736,00:15:43.476
laughs] what about no plate
tickets [audience muffled] so
thank you so yeah you can umm

00:15:43.476,00:15:48.481
you can be just like me
{audience laughs] beer [speaker
laughs] [audience laughs and

00:15:52.151,00:15:56.756
claps] umm there’s an article
down there umm about this guy uh
he got no plate back in like the

00:15:56.756,00:16:01.260
70’s and he uh he has been
fighting the good fight for like
forever and he goes to court and

00:16:01.260,00:16:06.966
his like yeah it wasnt me but
yeah theres a article about umm
ya but going back back to the

00:16:06.966,00:16:13.639
the ALPR data so umm as you can
see umm the the cop cars when
they driving around Seattle they

00:16:13.639,00:16:17.910
kinda reading like everything
sides of buildings random
constructions signs so there’s

00:16:17.910,00:16:24.250
another one what happens if you
register a plate in esauwn,
jeep, I don't know ummm and

00:16:24.250,00:16:29.922
there's some other anomalies so
uh you see there's a ton of
variations of the word police so

00:16:29.922,00:16:35.094
it’s clearly you know reading
the sides of cop cars so if
somebody in the Seattle area

00:16:35.094,00:16:40.833
wants to try this umm you know
you can’t impersonate a uh a
police officer but maybe you can

00:16:40.833,00:16:47.073
talk to you know a lady at the
DMV and explain how you a huge
fan of the, of the band police

00:16:47.073,00:16:53.813
[audience muffled] and get
POL1C3 or something and a drive
over the 520 bridge and tell me

00:16:53.813,00:16:59.485

what it means is that it is
someone knowingly alters data
