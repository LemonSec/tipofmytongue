00:00:00.367,00:00:06.807
>>So hi, I’m Kitty. >>[audience]
Hi Kitty. >>[laughs] Um I’m
known by you know a couple other

00:00:06.807,00:00:13.380
handles but mostly um in my work
day people call me Nina. Um
before I give my talk, as you

00:00:13.380,00:00:18.418
can see on the screen I do have
to say, I’m required actually,
to say um that the views

00:00:18.418,00:00:21.755
expressed here do not
necessarily represent the views
of the navy, the department of

00:00:21.755,00:00:26.994
defense, or the US government.
And I’m required to say that
because technically I’m a I’m a

00:00:26.994,00:00:33.333
fed I guess. In my work day I’m
a professor at the naval war
college inside the strategic and

00:00:33.333,00:00:39.673
operational research department.
Which really means that I study
um emerging technologies and how

00:00:39.673,00:00:44.544
they affect warfare and defense
and that would include the cyber
ring. And so that’s part of why

00:00:44.544,00:00:49.583
I follow your community. But um
all of that actually has
absolutely nothing to do with

00:00:49.583,00:00:56.490
what I’m talking about today. Um
last year right around August I
bought a used Nespresso maker

00:00:56.490,00:01:02.129
and so I just wanted to come and
talk about the story about what
happened. Um so with the company

00:01:02.129,00:01:06.733
Nespresso um the pods and the
makers are purchased mostly
online. There are some boutiques

00:01:06.733,00:01:11.238
across the country but by and
large, you can buy your coffee
from Nespresso directly from

00:01:11.238,00:01:18.045
their website and so with my new
used machine I realized that the
pods were really expensive. So I

00:01:18.045,00:01:22.482
decided that I’d have a look to
see if I could get them
somewhere for cheaper. Um and it

00:01:22.482,00:01:27.487
turns out you can. Um you can
get them on eBay. Um so in fact
scandalously cheap and I found a

00:01:29.823,00:01:34.428
listing um in which the current
bid was about half of what I’d
pay if I were buying directly

00:01:34.428,00:01:40.901
from Nespresso. So um the only
trick was that I had to buy 200
pods at a time. Um it’s not a

00:01:40.901,00:01:45.639
big deal, I drink a lot of
coffee so it seemed fine. I set
my bid. I wandered off um and

00:01:45.639,00:01:52.179
when I came back I’d won. So um
so I paid with paypal and I
moved on and a week or so later

00:01:52.179,00:01:57.184
my coffee arrived. Um but with
it also at my doorstep um in a
separate box um was this little

00:01:59.353,00:02:04.291
gem. It’s also here on stage. It
was a brand new espresso maker
in addition to the coffee that

00:02:06.360,00:02:11.164
I’d purchased. Um and so you’re
looking at a Nespresso Pixie.
It’s one of Nespresso’s most

00:02:11.164,00:02:16.536
compact little espresso makers.
It retails at about 280 dollars
and it takes the small coffee

00:02:16.536,00:02:22.509
pods that are about 70 cents a
piece. So this initially just
feels like an ordering mistake

00:02:22.509,00:02:27.514
to me. And so I go back to eBay
to figure out whether I had
accidentally pushed some buy it

00:02:27.514,00:02:34.221
now function um and uh purchased
it but I hadn’t. Um so I turned
to the packaging and boxes. I

00:02:34.221,00:02:39.226
opened them both up um and I
look over the tracking label and
I find out that not only um is

00:02:39.226,00:02:45.532
does the invoice have the same
uh sender and both are intended
to come to me um but they’re

00:02:45.532,00:02:50.137
shipped directly from Nespresso.
And they weren’t supposed to.
They were supposed to come from

00:02:50.137,00:02:56.777
some third party. Um so I turn
again to eBay to um to look at
the transaction and compare it

00:02:56.777,00:03:02.682
to the invoice and I find out
that the sellers name on eBay,
let’s call her Sue from Chicago,

00:03:02.682,00:03:09.122
um that accountholder’s name is
nothing like the accountholder’s
name on the on the Nespresso

00:03:09.122,00:03:15.695
side. We’re going to call him
George from Poughkeepsie. Um in
addition Sue from Chicago had a

00:03:15.695,00:03:21.268
zero zero seller rating and had
just opened her account um just
a couple weeks prior and the

00:03:21.268,00:03:26.039
only thing she was selling was
Nespresso. So at this point I’m
starting to think this looks a

00:03:26.039,00:03:31.445
little bit like fraud so I
decide I’m going to escalate,
I’m going to find out and I call

00:03:31.445,00:03:36.950
Nespresso. A little bit
reluctantly because um I’m sort
of greedy and I would really

00:03:36.950,00:03:42.622
like to keep the machine. Um so
I explained to customer service
that I had not ordered the

00:03:42.622,00:03:48.061
machine but I had ordered the
coffee um but I hadn’t purchased
it directly from Nespresso um

00:03:48.061,00:03:54.000
but instead from eBay and so she
could confirm to me essentially
that yes in fact George from

00:03:54.000,00:04:00.107
Poughkeepsie’s credit card had
been charged for both items. So
I said you might want to call

00:04:00.107,00:04:06.113
George and let him know or I’d
be happy to call George and
explain what is going on and

00:04:06.113,00:04:11.118
find out whether he had really
intended to send me this really
nice gift. Um and she noted that

00:04:11.118,00:04:16.923
she said she wouldn’t give me
his number. So I had no way to
prove any of this but I kept

00:04:16.923,00:04:20.327
thinking this is definitely
gotta be fraud but it wasn’t
clear to me who was losing out

00:04:20.327,00:04:25.866
in the game. Um but I told
Nespresso, please send me a
prepaid mailing label and once I

00:04:25.866,00:04:30.537
got it I would happily send back
their machine. This is a ploy
you know cause manufacturers

00:04:30.537,00:04:35.542
never want the machine back. Um
she took my information, sent it
to the fraud department um and

00:04:35.542,00:04:39.980
then told me to watch my mail
and if I and if they wanted it
back the fraud department would

00:04:39.980,00:04:44.985
send me a label. I obviously
still have the machine. But my
ethics are restored right? I’ve

00:04:47.621,00:04:53.226
reported the fraud and I get to
keep the machine. In the
meantime, I still can’t quite

00:04:53.226,00:04:59.132
figure out what’s happening. So
um I google around a bit and it
brings me to Krebs own security

00:04:59.132,00:05:04.905
site and I find this uh graphic
and it helps me explain sort of
what might be happening. So this

00:05:04.905,00:05:10.577
is triangulation fraud and if
you’re not familiar um you’ve
got a 3 part um triangle there

00:05:10.577,00:05:15.582
and the whole trick is to
convert a line of credit into
cash using the seams that happen

00:05:15.582,00:05:20.854
between companies and the last
step in that chain is the mule,
is what they call the mule.

00:05:20.854,00:05:25.692
That’s the person who is doing
the cash conversion. The
fraudster steals somebodies PI

00:05:25.692,00:05:30.697
and establishes a credit line or
they just go to a carding site
and get a card. Um the fraudster

00:05:30.697,00:05:35.368
identifies a major company, in
this case Nespresso, um and
they’re selling some luxury

00:05:35.368,00:05:40.140
goods um and they set up an
account with that company. The
target company usually has

00:05:40.140,00:05:46.179
really reliable fast shipping um
and a simple account system that
is um that doesn’t have too many

00:05:46.179,00:05:51.284
security checks to it. Then the
fraudster sets up their eBay
account, sets up a fake uh

00:05:51.284,00:05:58.124
profile and starts selling stuff
super cheap. Um when the auction
completes the eBay account um

00:05:58.124,00:06:03.230
the unsuspecting buyer sends
their money to eBay and they
have now become the mule. Right?

00:06:03.230,00:06:07.734
They have given the fraudster
the cash they need but remember
they’re selling, the fraudster

00:06:07.734,00:06:12.772
is selling something they don’t
actually own. And the eBay
process won’t complete until

00:06:12.772,00:06:16.509
there’s a shipping invoice
that’s that’s uh that’s
generated. So the next thing

00:06:16.509,00:06:21.114
that has to happen is your
fraudster uses the credit card
to buy the stuff directly from

00:06:21.114,00:06:27.420
the manufacturer, send it to the
buyer from eBay and then the
whole triangle is complete. The

00:06:27.420,00:06:31.591
shipping notification is
generated and everyone is happy.
The fraudster takes the money

00:06:31.591,00:06:36.863
from the sale, it pays eBay it’s
money from the commission and
relists for more items. It’s a

00:06:36.863,00:06:41.301
seamless triangle uh the buyer
has no idea that they’re a mule
and all that they know is that

00:06:41.301,00:06:45.472
they’re getting a really good
deal for really legit goods. Um
and so the incentive for

00:06:45.472,00:06:52.412
everyone to continue is um is to
to participate and keep quiet.
Unless of course that buyer is

00:06:52.412,00:06:57.784
me and you somehow sent me um an
espresso machine that I didn’t
order and I really wanted to

00:06:57.784,00:07:02.422
know why I got the extra machine
because I had been already made
happy by paying half price for

00:07:02.422,00:07:07.427
my coffee. So I had 2 theories.
1, this person or persons sucked
as bookkeepers and so I imagine

00:07:10.096,00:07:13.800
that maybe they were like copy
pasting from an excel
spreadsheet into the

00:07:13.800,00:07:20.006
manufacturer’s website and it
accidentally sent me an extra
coffee maker. Or 2, maybe they

00:07:20.006,00:07:25.378
wanted to buy my love. Like
maybe these triangles are so
fragile that the setup of these

00:07:25.378,00:07:29.783
accounts and the burn of these
credit cards are so fragile that
they’re trying to make me super

00:07:29.783,00:07:34.621
happy so that I won’t question
it and that I’ll just keep
buying. So the right thing to do

00:07:34.621,00:07:40.460
now that Nespresso has given me
this coffee maker um was to
embark on a campaign of research

00:07:40.460,00:07:45.465
and buy more coffee. [laughter]
I know. I know you’re thinking
I’m a terrible person um but

00:07:47.834,00:07:52.972
first this this is called
confessions for a reason and
second, I’m still guessing this

00:07:52.972,00:07:56.943
is fraud but I don’t really
know. Right? Like so how big is
this operation? Um so I needed

00:07:56.943,00:08:01.748
more data and specifically I
didn’t just need more data from
the 1 seller, what I wanted to

00:08:01.748,00:08:08.054
know is if this is some sort of
criminal underground gang like a
Nigerian um prince scam or some

00:08:08.054,00:08:13.059
IRS um gift card scheme. Right?
This should be happening at
scale in some way. Um so I

00:08:15.095,00:08:19.499
generate a series of questions.
I’ve way overthought this by the
way. I generate a series of

00:08:19.499,00:08:24.104
questions um and I try and
figure out who these thieves
are. Um to be clear, there are

00:08:24.104,00:08:29.676
plenty of thieves on eBay. I
just wanted to find these ones
specifically. Alright? So um I

00:08:29.676,00:08:34.781
ask are there other accounts?
Can I find those other accounts?
How fast do those account burn?

00:08:34.781,00:08:39.185
Um and most importantly can I
get them to make the same
mistake twice? Can I get them to

00:08:39.185,00:08:44.190
send me more extra free stuff?
[laughter] There’s no there’s no
greed in this it’s fine.

00:08:47.560,00:08:52.232
[laughter] Using eBay’s auction
search tool and the initial
account as the template I try

00:08:52.232,00:08:57.003
and find other recently created
account with 0 ratings selling
Nespresso. So 3 things. I need

00:08:57.003,00:09:00.807
them to sell Nespresso. I need
them to have the 0 rating and I
need that account to be

00:09:00.807,00:09:05.812
relatively new. Um so if the
fraud triangle is sloppy, as I
think they probably will be,

00:09:08.581,00:09:12.118
then there’s probably some
laziness. There’s some
duplication in description and

00:09:12.118,00:09:16.890
the use of images which makes
the search easier. If these
triangles are fragile, that

00:09:16.890,00:09:21.361
means they burn really fast and
I have to look at them often,
like every day. Alright? So eBay

00:09:21.361,00:09:26.533
lets you automate these searches
so I set my template and I set
the search for 200 capsules at

00:09:26.533,00:09:31.070
99 dollars. I searched for an
espresso machines as well but it
doesn’t it doesn’t kind of

00:09:31.070,00:09:36.276
creates any good pooling data so
I stick with just looking for
capsules. Um and each day I get

00:09:36.276,00:09:40.680
in my email inbox a report of
the results. Usually 100 or so
and I have to weed through them.

00:09:40.680,00:09:46.186
And at the outset it’s a little
bit hard. It takes me time to
find my specific set of coffee

00:09:46.186,00:09:51.991
thieves um because um while it’s
easy to find someone selling a
lot of coffee, it’s harder to

00:09:51.991,00:09:57.464
figure out where there when the
account is brand new and when
the account has a 0 rating. And

00:09:57.464,00:10:02.669
that’s actually due to eBay uh
to eBay’s design. So if you look
up at the image um you will see

00:10:02.669,00:10:07.173
those stars up there. One would
think that that’s the seller
rating. That’s not a seller

00:10:07.173,00:10:12.679
rating, that is actually a
generic review of what people
think of Nespresso coffee. But

00:10:12.679,00:10:17.617
it makes the buyer think that
that might be a seller rating
and so you feel calmer, you feel

00:10:17.617,00:10:22.622
like you’re more reassured. In
fact they bury the seller rating
for brand new accounts near the

00:10:22.622,00:10:26.793
bottom in tiny font. And then
similarly you have to click
through to find out when that

00:10:26.793,00:10:33.266
account was built. Now, that
takes some time. But the good
news is is that eBay’s website

00:10:33.266,00:10:38.671
wants to help me. Right? So
every time I do the search and I
resolve it it’s watching me do

00:10:38.671,00:10:43.543
that and so even when my clicks
proved unsuccessful it would
offer on the bottom of the

00:10:43.543,00:10:48.248
screen, here is some similar
items. Maybe you want to buy
from these people. And so often

00:10:48.248,00:10:52.685
I ended up uncovering uh the
accounts that I was looking for
through their own website

00:10:52.685,00:10:57.690
offering stuff to me. Um so like
a good researcher, I created a
spreadsheet to track each of the

00:11:00.493,00:11:04.631
unique accounts with their
opening date uh with their
ratings over time and eventually

00:11:04.631,00:11:09.269
when the counts go dormant,
everything they sold and how
much they profited. Um then I

00:11:09.269,00:11:14.908
selected 2 accounts opened
within 6 days of one another.
With those 2 accounts I made 2

00:11:14.908,00:11:20.847
separate purchases to try and
see um if they could send me
extra stuff. A week later I

00:11:20.847,00:11:25.852
received 200 pods of coffee plus
200 pods of coffee. [cheering]
Then a few days later I received

00:11:29.889,00:11:34.894
200 pods of coffee plus a brand
new milk frother. [laughter]
Retail value 119 dollars. I

00:11:38.565,00:11:44.637
didn’t really care for the
frother because I wasn’t really
a cappuccino person [laughter]

00:11:44.637,00:11:50.510
but I tried it out and it turns
out it’s really amazing so thank
you [laughter] fraudster

00:11:50.510,00:11:55.515
overgiver. I have upgraded to
cappuccino. Uh remarkable
really. Um but more importantly

00:11:58.518,00:12:03.456
[laughs] I found them.
[cheering] I found them Right?
And so by looking at these 2

00:12:03.456,00:12:08.695
brand new accounts, buying from
these 2 accounts, opened roughly
the same time um I I’d managed

00:12:08.695,00:12:12.966
to locate them. Right? Um they
were yes, using the same images.
Yes, using the same

00:12:12.966,00:12:17.503
descriptions. Um I tried to
write them emails and chat back
and forth, ask for different

00:12:17.503,00:12:22.508
flavors of coffee, sometimes
just to say hello. Um but they
never wrote back. Um I also did

00:12:24.611,00:12:29.015
by the way, look on eBay’s
reports page to try and report
these accounts because I

00:12:29.015,00:12:33.353
realized like that this is not
good. I shouldn’t participate in
this. Right? So it turns out you

00:12:33.353,00:12:38.358
can’t report fraud on eBay’s
website if you actually receive
the item. So there’s a thing for

00:12:40.827,00:12:45.164
“didn’t receive the item.”
There’s a thing for “damaged
goods received” but there’s

00:12:45.164,00:12:49.969
nothing for “I got extra stuff
and I’m trying to report this.”
Right? [laughter] So it didn’t

00:12:49.969,00:12:54.974
work out. So anyway okay so um
so I give up. So ok um so we’re
now 3 orders deep in my research

00:12:57.877,00:13:02.949
campaign. I isolate 2 other
closely paired sets of accounts.
I completed another 2 purchases

00:13:02.949,00:13:09.689
and the first order arrives
again. 200 pods. 200 more pods.
Alright? So I get twice the

00:13:09.689,00:13:15.361
amount of coffee again. But the
second one, something finally
interesting happens, the

00:13:15.361,00:13:20.366
fraudster wrote me a letter. It
looks like this. “Hello friend,
first thanks a lot because you

00:13:24.771,00:13:30.243
choose my listing to buy.
Second, I’m so so sorry because
this product is not in best

00:13:30.243,00:13:35.381
condition so I can’t send it to
you because I always want
everything best for you. My mom

00:13:35.381,00:13:41.554
has sick on hospital now so I
can find any other item in best
condition to ship to you and I

00:13:41.554,00:13:46.359
have to go to the hospital with
her now so um I hope you
understand for me and let me

00:13:46.359,00:13:51.364
cancel oder. Thank you and god
bless you!” What a nice guy. And
my money was refunded to me. So

00:13:57.603,00:14:02.075
of course I replied, “I’m super
sorry your mom is sick, um I
will order again in the future”.

00:14:02.075,00:14:07.547
Uh that account did close about
a week later. I was weirdly
sorry to see it go. [laughter]

00:14:07.547,00:14:14.087
Um but it was a super polite
fraudster and I really hope his
mom is okay. [laughter] On the

00:14:14.087,00:14:19.292
research side, I took that
letter of course as data. I
spent a few hours searching for

00:14:19.292,00:14:25.832
a tool. In my wild imagination I
was hoping that perhaps someone
had created a um like an

00:14:25.832,00:14:30.136
language engligh language
grammatical error guessor.
Right? And that it would somehow

00:14:30.136,00:14:35.208
like be a crappy version of
google translate except it would
attach like what other language

00:14:35.208,00:14:41.080
might be making these mistakes.
Turns out that tool doesn’t
exist. Project for you.

00:14:41.080,00:14:44.517
[laughter] In its place and in a
moment of poor judgement I
decided to ask my friends who

00:14:44.517,00:14:49.922
speak other languages whether or
not these errors looked
familiar. Nobody seemed to know

00:14:49.922,00:14:55.661
what I was talking about and it
started to feel a little racist.
[laughter] So I stopped that

00:14:55.661,00:15:00.600
line of inquiry pretty fast. But
I’m also you know broadly aware
that um fraudsters will emulate

00:15:02.769,00:15:06.506
not being able to speak English
to kind of throw you off their
trail so I don’t actually know

00:15:06.506,00:15:11.544
whether or not they’re domestic
or or um located in the U.S. So
anyway at this point the whole

00:15:11.544,00:15:16.315
coffee thing had gotten way out
of hand. My conscience
[laughter] is weighing on me. My

00:15:16.315,00:15:22.288
kitchen is a complete disaster
and it’s time to stop this game.
It really is. Um so I don’t need

00:15:22.288,00:15:25.992
that much coffee and I was about
a hundred dollars per data
point. Like each time I’m paying

00:15:25.992,00:15:30.463
about a hundred bucks to learn
more about these people. I am
not independently wealthy. This

00:15:30.463,00:15:35.468
is not a sustainable venture. So
um ok so here’s the final tally.
Um this is my this is a version

00:15:37.804,00:15:43.509
of my spreadsheet. All of those
accounts are dead now. Um so um
5 attempted purchases, um 4 were

00:15:43.509,00:15:48.514
successful. 1200 pods total. 1
frother. 1 espresso machine. I
spent just under 400 dollars. Um

00:15:52.018,00:15:57.123
the value again, not on sale,
Nespresso has good sales by the
way, um just under a thousand

00:15:57.123,00:16:01.794
dollars of goods received. Um in
October I took all this data
that I’d collected and complete

00:16:01.794,00:16:06.599
with the names, the invoices,
the accounts, um and everything
that I had in paperwork and I

00:16:06.599,00:16:11.737
sent it all to the FBI to try
and see if they could figure out
something to do with it. Um I

00:16:11.737,00:16:15.241
also reported all of this to
eBay and anybody else who would
listen. Um 30 following that

00:16:15.241,00:16:20.246
report, I I never got any
response back from the FBI but
30 days following that report um

00:16:24.383,00:16:30.556
the activity seemed to stop. So
maybe something happened. As far
as finding out who these people

00:16:30.556,00:16:36.362
were, um I didn’t have very
much. I really wanted to uncover
some kind of cool underground

00:16:36.362,00:16:41.033
like credit card scheme from
Morocco or something. Um but it
didn’t happen. There was none of

00:16:41.033,00:16:46.038
that was in the offing. Um but
this isn’t a hero story right?
It’s a confession. So um here’s

00:16:48.174,00:16:52.211
what I learned. When I started
telling people this story, when
I started explaining what was

00:16:52.211,00:16:57.583
happening to me, people often
told me that this was a
victimless crime. Um the more I

00:16:57.583,00:17:03.022
thought about it, that’s just
not true. Right? Um the little I
do know about George from

00:17:03.022,00:17:06.659
Poughkeepsie, cause I did a lot
of research on him to try to
figure out if I could contact

00:17:06.659,00:17:12.265
him, um and some of the other
account names, is it that they
were all over or at retirement

00:17:12.265,00:17:18.170
age. We’re talking about a
vulnerable population here.
Right? Um and these aren’t

00:17:18.170,00:17:22.375
victimless crimes. The victims
don’t know how to mitigate the
damage that’s happening to them.

00:17:22.375,00:17:29.181
They don’t even know it’s going
on. Um recovery from identity
theft works for people um uh who

00:17:29.181,00:17:33.686
are equipped to deal with it but
not the elderly. And so we’re
just not far enough along in

00:17:33.686,00:17:38.624
this nation trying to figure out
how to protect those people. Um
2, for this kind of scheme it’s

00:17:38.624,00:17:43.996
easy to be unknowingly
complicit. It’s also super easy
to be knowingly complicit. And

00:17:43.996,00:17:49.168
this is a story about
thresholds. So under a certain a
certain threshold um the

00:17:49.168,00:17:55.408
incentive is to cheat. EBay
doesn’t care. Nespresso doesn’t
care. At the end of the day

00:17:55.408,00:18:00.313
you’re getting you’re your goods
for cheap so your incentive is
to cheat as well. If it exceeds

00:18:00.313,00:18:04.850
the threshold everybody gets
excited. But before then it’s
all priced into the market. The

00:18:04.850,00:18:09.555
insurance cards have got it.
Everyone’s got it covered.
EBay’s got themselves covered.

00:18:09.555,00:18:14.560
And so really the only person
who is going to stop it is you
or me. And I’ve stopped. I won’t

00:18:17.563,00:18:22.501
do it anymore. It’s not okay. Um
all I have left is this
confession and my promise to

00:18:22.501,00:18:27.773
walk away from all of this. And
I have a lot of coffee.
[laughter] But maybe one I can

00:18:27.773,00:18:32.778
do one last good thing so um up
for auction is this wonderful
gently used Nespresso machine.

00:18:41.253,00:18:46.325
[laughter and applause] Whatever
coffee is left, you can have it.
Um bidding at, this is a

00:18:46.325,00:18:52.531
terrible idea by the way.
Bidding starts to uh right now
as soon as I can post it on my

00:18:52.531,00:18:59.372
Twitter account. Just go ahead
and um bid. It’s cash only. The
bidding tomorrow at 10 am. You

00:18:59.372,00:19:05.211
can come pick it up at Tamper
Evident Village um by the box um
um please bring. Don’t be a jerk

00:19:05.211,00:19:10.016
and bid and then not show up.
All of those proceeds will go to
the Diana Initiative. And I

00:19:10.016,00:19:14.286
promise you’ll watch all of that
transaction. It will be totally
transparent. It’ll be online. Um

00:19:14.286,00:19:18.624
but definitely um if you don’t
show up you’ll have the force of
public opinion and if this all

00:19:18.624,00:19:24.096
falls apart well it’s DefCon
anyway. Um that’s my twitter
handle. It’s nothing like my

00:19:24.096,00:19:27.833
handle but um but I don’t know I
will I will flash this again but
I just wanted to say one last

00:19:27.833,00:19:32.138
thing, which is thank you. You
guys are awesome. And a shout
out to my Mom and my Dad.

00:19:32.138,00:19:37.143
