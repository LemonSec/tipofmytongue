00:00:00.067,00:00:05.672
Good afternoon everyone, My name
is effffn I am one of the leads
of the NOC. Thanks for being

00:00:05.672,00:00:10.677
here. Uh the last time we had
one of these was DC nineteen at
the Rio so it’s been awhile. So,

00:00:15.549,00:00:19.620
throughout the year we always
get like questions like how we
do the network here and the

00:00:19.620,00:00:25.158
network keeps changing over and
over, like different properties
and things like that. So we

00:00:25.158,00:00:30.163
submitted a talk. It got
accepted. We hope you guys enjoy
it. So, starting with the most

00:00:32.466,00:00:37.471
important introductions, who are
we? So, I said already who I am.
So we are just going to go

00:00:39.673,00:00:45.746
around. I’m going to ask each
one of you to say your name or
handle, say what you do here at

00:00:45.746,00:00:50.751
DefCon How many years have you
been gooning uh with the NOC or
with DefCon. Ah, if you want you

00:00:53.186,00:00:58.191
can say what you do for your day
job and what you do exactly,
right? If you are in offensive

00:01:00.227,00:01:07.000
security, networking, blue team
whatever. So turning over to
Mack. >>Hey everyone, I’m Mack.

00:01:07.000,00:01:09.336
I’m the number two in the NOC,
uh responsible and this is like
DefCon Eleven or sorry eleventh

00:01:09.336,00:01:13.307
DefCon for me. Uh, so I am
responsible for a lot of core
infrastructure and overall

00:01:13.307,00:01:18.312
planning of the, the network.
So, John Going down the line?
>>Yup, down the line. Get in the

00:01:24.551,00:01:29.556
lineup. >>Hi, I’m John I’m uh
Collin’s wifi bitch so I
basically do stuff for wifi. Uh,

00:01:32.993,00:01:38.598
this is my third year officially
and I have been a friend to the
NOC for a long time before that.

00:01:38.598,00:01:43.370
My day job is working for the
wifi vendor Aruba and I think
the reason that they asked me to

00:01:43.370,00:01:47.140
be part of the NOC team is they
were too cheap to pay for a
support contract and if they

00:01:47.140,00:01:51.378
wanted like firmware updates
[laughter]they know that I can
get that stuff. So I can think

00:01:51.378,00:01:56.383
of no other reason why I am here
besides that. Hi, my name is
Phil I, uh, I work with NOC. I

00:02:00.387,00:02:06.493
am not part of the NOC I kind of
am. I’m the, uh, regional
infrastructure manager for

00:02:06.493,00:02:11.865
Caeser’s Entertainment I help
them set up their network around
the buildings Escort them here,

00:02:11.865,00:02:16.870
escort them there. Help them put
their equipment in. >>Thank you
Phil! Woo! [applause] >>Good job

00:02:21.041,00:02:27.347
Phil with the screws. >>Hi
everyone, my name is Monsi I am
the NOC’s tribute. This is my

00:02:27.347,00:02:32.352
third year. So all the Gaff tape
and running around That’s
essentially what I do. Thanks

00:02:38.191,00:02:42.362
[applause] >>Hi my name is
Price. Um, this is my third
year. Ah, I took a couple of

00:02:42.362,00:02:47.367
years off. Um, I’m a runner for
the, for the NOC. In my day job
I build automation frameworks

00:02:49.870,00:02:54.875
from the ground up. [applause]
>>Hi my name’s Collin uh you can
find me underscore CRB on

00:02:59.613,00:03:05.886
Twitter. I am the, I guess, boss
of John uh I am the wireless
team lead and uh my day job, I,

00:03:05.886,00:03:11.792
ah, work for CDW as the wireless
technical architect so I’ve been
doing wireless for yeah, about

like that. >>You’re supposed to
know >>Yeah, f**k, I don’t know.

00:03:31.344,00:03:36.349
Um, I do wired side. That’s it.
>>Hey, I’m Nick. Also, Um,
c7five. This is my fifth year

00:03:40.187,00:03:45.325
and I do wifi reg and other
miscellaneous things. Um, my day
job I’m the, I’m head of

00:03:45.325,00:03:51.598
security at a cryptocurrency
exchange called Kraken. Um and I
also run um Drunk Hacker History

00:03:51.598,00:03:56.736
here at DefCon [cheers] so
tonight at eight o’clock, Planet
Hollywood mezzanine stage. Join

00:03:56.736,00:04:01.675
Us. [applause] >>My name’s Mike
or Sparky. Um, I’ve been with
the, the NOC for, for sixteen

00:04:07.447,00:04:14.087
years Um, I guess that makes me
the most senior one. Um, yeah,
except for I am not the boss. Uh

00:04:14.087,00:04:19.426
I run like operations set up
teams uh for the NOC and my day
job is Point of Sale

00:04:19.426,00:04:24.431
applications. [applause] >>Hi,
I’m Spencer uh I do most of our
monitoring and wired switch

00:04:29.836,00:04:34.841
config stuff. Um, not most of
that I help with that [laughs].
Uh for my day job, I’m uh

00:04:37.644,00:04:42.649
reverse engineer for Cisco Talos
[applause] >>Hey, uh I’m Wish uh
this is my second year gooning

00:04:47.587,00:04:52.592
um I help with all the taping
and wiring and stuff like that.
[applause] >>Hello, I’m Topher,

00:04:57.864,00:05:02.802
I just showed up to the NOC this
year ah, yeah.
[laughter][applause] >>Woo!

00:05:05.772,00:05:10.777
>>Hey I’m John uh this is my
second year of gooning and I
just work here.

00:05:15.782,00:05:19.486
[laughter][applause] >>Um, I’m
Fit for Death I am actually
number two to Phil so I work for

00:05:19.486,00:05:24.491
the Casino and do exactly what
Phil does. So yeah, this is my
uh sixth year. >>And I’m uh

00:05:29.796,00:05:34.401
Dedication and I think I’ve been
here for four years because I am
really good at building network

00:05:34.401,00:05:39.406
cables. [laughter] [applause]
>>So we just want to highlight
that the, the team itself has

00:05:43.276,00:05:47.881
got a mix of backgrounds and
skill sets and that’s one of the
things that we really value

00:05:47.881,00:05:53.320
inside the NOC. Um, you know,
going to the, anyone can be a
part of the NOC obviously

00:05:53.320,00:05:58.024
there’s, there’s some some
requirements but you know, NOC
people can come from anywhere.

00:05:58.024,00:06:02.963
So, we’re just like you. We even
allow Canadians. Yeah [laughter]
>>It’s true. >>Grandfathered in

00:06:06.967,00:06:11.972
>>All right, so that’s about us
um, you know, what do we do, who
do we help out? Basically we

00:06:15.675,00:06:21.548
provide the core infrastructure
that all of the villages, press,
contests, speakers, closed

00:06:21.548,00:06:26.920
caption, DCTV, roots, everyone
connects to um and we also
provide the wireless for

00:06:26.920,00:06:32.325
everyone, you know, anyone, any
of the attendees here. Um and we
have done a bunch of different

00:06:32.325,00:06:37.664
things inside of each, each of
these other requirements, their
own needs and we try to satisfy

00:06:37.664,00:06:42.669
and help out as many people as
we can. Um, do you want to talk?
OK, so a long time ago a long

00:06:47.807,00:06:53.513
time ago being eleven years so
that’s my memory. Uh, we’d
usually arrive sometime around

00:06:53.513,00:06:57.717
you know, Sunday night, get
started on Monday and would work
through the week. We started

00:06:57.717,00:07:02.555
moving that a little bit closer
uh in the last few years just
because there’s a lot more

00:07:02.555,00:07:06.793
properties, there’s a lot more
people and there’s a lot more
going on. But it really comes

00:07:06.793,00:07:10.997
down to, you know, just like you
build out any of the you
foundations for other networks,

00:07:10.997,00:07:15.435
you gotta have your wired in,
you have to have your core in,
you have to get your wired out

00:07:15.435,00:07:19.272
to all of your edges, you have
to get access points hung, you
have to get them, you know,

00:07:19.272,00:07:25.278
pulled back, you have to connect
for everyone’s there. Um, and
then the conference starts and

00:07:25.278,00:07:31.318
it becomes a whole lot of, you
know, uh last minute requests
sudden requests, issues,

00:07:31.318,00:07:37.957
eccetera, um, so this kind of
leads into we moved a little bit
earlier this year I arrived

00:07:37.957,00:07:44.130
Thursday a week before to get
stuff going um and its been a
fairly smooth year I think

00:07:44.130,00:07:49.369
although I am totally jinxing it
right now. Um, so we will see
what happens especially after

00:07:49.369,00:07:55.442
the DNS talk then ended about a
half hour ago. >>Atta boy! >>Um
So that’s it, I mean there isn’t

00:07:55.442,00:07:59.512
a whole lot to the complexity
and we will totally go into
questions in a bit and you can

00:07:59.512,00:08:05.819
ask what you want about the
infrastructure um, [laughs]
thank you everyone. [applause]

00:08:05.819,00:08:10.824
>>There you go! Thanks you guys.
[applause] >>It’s, it’s nice to
be the speaker. You have people

00:08:13.793,00:08:18.665
bring you stuff, it’s cool. You
should submit. >>Thanks you
DCTV. >>[laughs] Thanks you

00:08:18.665,00:08:23.670
DCTV. >>Um, so that, you know,
again, not a whole lot there uh
from the the complexity of the

00:08:26.639,00:08:31.644
infrastructure side uh, or the
wired side so now I am going to
talk about the wireless. Collin?

00:08:33.780,00:08:38.852
John? >>Present >>Yup, >>Sorry
>>You’re up. >>Bring open a beer
>>Actually, before that >>Oh

00:08:38.852,00:08:44.424
sorry, what’d I forget >>No, no,
co- come up. Part of this pres,
this is not a presentation. The

00:08:44.424,00:08:49.963
idea is to be like you guys
interacting with us and asking
questions and so on and so

00:08:49.963,00:08:55.402
forth. So instead of like trying
to break the ice a little bit
wifi has a lot of information uh

00:08:55.402,00:08:59.572
that I think is going to sparkle
some questions in your mind or
things that you already want to

00:08:59.572,00:09:04.911
ask us, So John and Collin
they’re going to go through the
wireless stuff, but in the

00:09:04.911,00:09:09.916
meantime takes notes uh we want
to hear questions from you guys
otherwise we are not going to be

00:09:12.819,00:09:17.824
here for the remaining eighty
minutes. >>Sure. So as Mack and
Luis mentioned im, there’s a lot

00:09:20.293,00:09:24.564
of precon stuff that we do and
specifically with the wireless,
if you guys have been coming

00:09:24.564,00:09:29.536
here for a few years know we
changed venues. We’ve expanded
uh, we were at Caesar's last

00:09:29.536,00:09:35.475
year, am I a little, little
closer better? Um, so it’s a
challenge for the wireless We’re

00:09:35.475,00:09:40.680
trying to put RF in different
spaces Um usually we’re gonna
try and do some sort of a site

00:09:40.680,00:09:44.984
walk through if it’s a totally
new property just so we can get
an eye on you know what things

00:09:44.984,00:09:51.958
look like um I do predictive
planning using a cool, a tool
called Ekahau. So we actually

00:09:51.958,00:09:57.397
take some time to see, you know,
will this amount of AP’s cover
where we think it will? We also

00:09:57.397,00:10:01.501
have the fun sort of situation
where I’d love to give you guys
more access points to have more

00:10:01.501,00:10:06.573
wireless, but we’ve got a limit
on drops, there are not infinite
amounts of drops and where I

00:10:06.573,00:10:10.910
want an AP doesn’t mean there’s
going to be a network connection
to feed that AP. So there’s,

00:10:10.910,00:10:15.748
there’s compromises on some of
these spaces and we gotta kind
of work with that as as

00:10:15.748,00:10:22.489
necessary and things change from
my original plans. On top of
that I’ll tell you guys that the

00:10:22.489,00:10:26.226
the folks that do the DefCon
planning do a great job of
accommodating and moving things

00:10:26.226,00:10:31.231
around but what’s in what room
is in flux so long up until we
get here that I kind of take

00:10:33.299,00:10:39.339
first shot at design and then we
know we gotta change it. Um, we
also stage equipment So all of

00:10:39.339,00:10:43.610
our stuff gets stood up probably
about a month or so before the
Con. We make sure that we got

00:10:43.610,00:10:48.715
new code on it We look at last
year’s config make any changes
we need to make. Um and then

00:10:48.715,00:10:52.519
make sure that also integrates
with the overall designs. So
again, different venues the last

00:10:52.519,00:10:55.555
couple of years, we’ve had
different network, network
topologies which meant the

00:10:55.555,00:11:01.728
wireless had to adjust slightly,
meaning we’re not just plugging
in what we had last year. Um,

00:11:01.728,00:11:06.099
and then, you know, as Max said,
we get here a little early so
that I was helping with fiber

00:11:06.099,00:11:11.804
and getting APs out and
inventoried as early as Saturday
evening when I got in. Anything

00:11:11.804,00:11:16.409
else we are doing pre-con? >>You
might notice the lie that was in
the previous slide The wired

00:11:16.409,00:11:20.647
network is only there to support
the wireless network. [laughter]
That’s the only reason that they

00:11:20.647,00:11:25.652
put wireless in. >>Um, these are
the tools that we’ve been using
this year, so, to do what we do

00:11:28.721,00:11:33.259
we don’t have to have these
tools but I will tell you it
makes our life a lot easier. So

00:11:33.259,00:11:38.264
down at the bottom left there
you’ve got the Ekahau sidekick,
thats uh spectrum analysis and

00:11:38.264,00:11:43.903
some wifi survey work and then a
bunch of netscout air fluke
tools to quickly diagnose port

00:11:43.903,00:11:50.143
problems and RF issues and as
always there is a console cable
in the mix and then uh a special

00:11:50.143,00:11:56.616
console cable for our access
points. And then just a little
bit about the hardware we are

00:11:56.616,00:12:02.889
using; we’ve got Aruba 7000s
series controllers the 7210 is
kind of the big boy, covers uh

00:12:02.889,00:12:09.028
the larger of the venues, and
then we’ve got a smaller 7005
covering just the Flamingo uh

00:12:09.028,00:12:14.434
right now we are running 6.5
code We’re using AP 305s and
we’ve got about 80 of them out

00:12:14.434,00:12:19.339
this year, probably about 100 in
inventory so when we have more
ports, we put more out if we

00:12:19.339,00:12:25.178
can. And then we are also
running Aruba Airwave as a
management. Just a little bit

00:12:25.178,00:12:30.216
about the settings. So, I’ve
seen stuff on Twitter after the
Con talking about, you know I, I

00:12:30.216,00:12:34.320
was on the wifi and nobody
attacked me this year. Well,
there’s a reason for that. So,

00:12:34.320,00:12:40.560
uh DefCon Open is 2.4 Gigahertz
only. We have client isolation,
so that means clients can’t talk

00:12:40.560,00:12:45.732
to each other when they are on
that network. We’re blocking
mDNS bonjour traffic. Ah,

00:12:45.732,00:12:49.235
basically our firewall is
saying, you can only go to the
internet and obviously it’s an

00:12:49.235,00:12:52.805
open network so there is no
encryption, anything that you
send over the air someone else

00:12:52.805,00:12:58.277
can sniff. Our DefCon Secure on
the other hand is 5 gig only, so
that kind of takes a lot of the

00:12:58.277,00:13:02.181
noise out of the cheap little
devices from China that are
really good at de-auth attacks

00:13:02.181,00:13:08.254
like you have to be a little bit
more specific to target that
network. Again client isolation

00:13:08.254,00:13:13.259
DNS, u mDNS blocking. Same thing
with the firewall but we are
using WPA2 Enterprise with PEAP

00:13:15.995,00:13:22.535
MSCHAPv2. And then the back end
of that is FreeRadius for our
client auth. Um and then just

00:13:22.535,00:13:26.773
sort of one underlying point
that I wanted to make about
these kind of networks that they

00:13:26.773,00:13:32.645
are very quick to come up. Your
standing there for a little
while. The simplicity is the key

00:13:32.645,00:13:36.115
in this. We don’t turn on a ton
of features. We want to lock
down the network. We want to

00:13:36.115,00:13:40.753
keep it secure, but a bunch of
the advanced stuff tends to
cause problems with certain

00:13:40.753,00:13:46.225
clients, then you guys have a
poor wifi experience, so we
uncheck about as much as we can,

00:13:46.225,00:13:49.829
aside from the bare bones things
that are going to keep you
getting on the network quickly,

00:13:49.829,00:13:54.834
getting you on the network
securely and then just letting
you do your thing. >>How many

00:13:54.834,00:13:59.872
people use the secure wifi
network this year? How many
people used the open wifi

00:13:59.872,00:14:05.378
network this year? So if I
remember uh DefCon, I don’t know
which number it was; it was at

00:14:05.378,00:14:10.983
the Riviera when uh, do you
remember AirPWN? When it first
came out? Basically it was on a

00:14:10.983,00:14:15.955
wi a uh, an open wireless
network and what it was doing
was essentially everybody that

00:14:15.955,00:14:20.827
downloaded a page from the
internet it would replace all of
the pictures in any web page

00:14:20.827,00:14:26.132
with uh with GoatSee [laughter]
and so you would see I would
just watch these guys sitting

00:14:26.132,00:14:29.902
out there typing something and
then all of the sudden they’d
slam their laptop lid shut. And

00:14:29.902,00:14:34.741
it repeated all over the place
That’s why we don’t use the open
wifi network at a hacker con.

00:14:34.741,00:14:39.812
Use the secure network and
things like that don’t happen.
[laughter] >>And, and I’ll say I

00:14:39.812,00:14:43.816
am proud of you guys We had like
well over 2,000 people on the
wireless so far this year.

00:14:43.816,00:14:49.622
You’ll see better stats at
closing uh and its predominantly
on the secure network, like Good

00:14:49.622,00:14:54.627
job guys. I’m, I’m glad to see
it. >>Op, you got a question?
>>Yeah. [inaudible off mic

00:14:57.697,00:15:02.635
question] Um the wireless is
not. I’m sorry yeah. The
question was are we blocking DNS

00:15:04.871,00:15:09.876
null queries? Correct? No. no
the wireless is not. Firewall?
No. [off mic question continues]

00:15:20.086,00:15:23.856
Uh, we have not looked at it
from the wireless. >>What was
the question? >>Yeah, eh. I’m

00:15:23.856,00:15:28.594
sorry. Um, are we seeing a lot
of instances with Iodine? And
I’m not familiar with it so ah.

00:15:30.596,00:15:36.102
[off mic commentary continues]
Oh, got it. So DNS tunneling
out. >>We don’t really watch for

00:15:36.102,00:15:39.872
it. >>Yeah, we’re not really
watching for that. As far as
going out, we kind of don’t care

00:15:39.872,00:15:46.779
go out, like we’re letting
people go out and do what they
need to do. >>Yeah we get that,

00:15:46.779,00:15:51.984
we get that question a lot of,
oh, my applications not working,
my something’s not working,

00:15:51.984,00:15:56.122
we’re blocking nothing, anything
you want to do as long as it is
going to the internet is is

00:15:56.122,00:16:01.060
allowed on, on this network.
[laughs] >>Uh and hopefully most
of you know about WIFI reg, it’s

00:16:04.163,00:16:08.801
the way that you create your
credentials for the secure
network uh it’s there’s nothing

00:16:08.801,00:16:12.738
really fancy to it, it’s a
pretty simple web server, we’ve
got a, a database in the back

00:16:12.738,00:16:18.611
end. It goes live the week
basically of the con so we
usually do some testing staging

00:16:18.611,00:16:23.683
before we get out here and then
once we’re here we fire it up so
that if you guys wanna do that

00:16:23.683,00:16:29.055
password user creation you can
do it on a secure network that
you trust, so do it from home,

00:16:29.055,00:16:34.093
do it before you get here, you
know, whatever, you don’t have
to do that off of our network.

00:16:34.093,00:16:37.363
And then we’ve got a bunch of
instructions so, lots of
different client types out

00:16:37.363,00:16:42.869
there, you know, how do you get
your device configured
appropriately to securely

00:16:42.869,00:16:47.707
connect to the PEAP network? And
sometimes we miss stuff, so we
have got some feedback, so thank

00:16:47.707,00:16:52.612
you for the, the folks that have
said like, hey I think you’ve
got a config line wrong um it’s

00:16:52.612,00:16:58.751
usually a, a quick and fast sort
of uh change of that page. So
yeah we miss things, we

00:16:58.751,00:17:03.222
appreciate you guys giving us
good feedback about things that
we miss so we can fix it. Um and

00:17:03.222,00:17:08.194
then just some examples of some
funny usernames you guys get
like pretty good usernames that

00:17:08.194,00:17:13.199
we see coming through the
wireless controller [laughs]
yeah [laughs]. Alright, this

00:17:15.434,00:17:21.340
year we had added some stuff. So
the lovely picture you see here,
um we found out that we had to

00:17:21.340,00:17:27.246
provide some WIFI over in the
theater area, and kind of last
minute threw up some access

00:17:27.246,00:17:33.386
points. So, again, not an ideal
scenario, if, if me putting my
wireless engineer hat on, I’d

00:17:33.386,00:17:37.557
want those in ceilings with
directional antennas, I’d want
about four times as much to

00:17:37.557,00:17:43.996
cover that area but, when you
have to do it in two hours, you
work with what you’ve got. Yeah

00:17:43.996,00:17:48.668
so actually I’ll let you >>I’ll
talk a little about mounting
because you see in the picture

00:17:48.668,00:17:52.905
here obviously that’s not the
way we like to mount WIFI access
points and we see tweets about

00:17:52.905,00:17:56.809
that sometimes of, you guys
don’t know what you’re doing,
you mounted the APs wrong. We do

00:17:56.809,00:18:02.281
know what we’re doing but we’re
limited by sort of what kind of
um mounting is available so you

00:18:02.281,00:18:06.452
know uh day one here I think on
Monday they wanted to put the
APs on the ceiling here like as

00:18:06.452,00:18:11.157
high as possibly cou- as they as
they possibly could, not
optimal. Um we’d like them on

00:18:11.157,00:18:15.761
stands, we’d like them up above
the, the people, and we’d like
them horizontal, and that’s

00:18:15.761,00:18:21.133
sometimes tough just based on
what types of uh stands we can
get and how we can, you know,

00:18:21.133,00:18:26.806
that we’ve used duct tape, we’ve
used bailing wire this year, no
no kidding, uh bailing wire to

00:18:26.806,00:18:32.778
attach uh APs, so it’s just a
matter of what we can get. >>And
we got, we got some of these

00:18:32.778,00:18:37.450
this year, so this is sort of
our ideal, uh unfortunately we
got them after all of the APs

00:18:37.450,00:18:41.354
were up in the air, this is
called the WIFI stand so like,
very handy, hopefully you’ll see

00:18:41.354,00:18:46.525
these next year, because they
orient the AP exactly how we
want, facing down uh they just

00:18:46.525,00:18:50.329
made it here a little bit late
so hopefully next year
[laughter] that’s what you’re

00:18:50.329,00:18:55.334
going to see everywhere. Um,
yeah, the no no no chrome I mean
maybe we could, you know,

00:18:58.871,00:19:04.243
bedazzle it or something you
know >>This is a hacker con
[laughter] >>Um so, some of the

00:19:04.243,00:19:09.448
other stuff we added this year,
Android App, so hopefully uh
everyone trusted that through

00:19:09.448,00:19:14.954
the Google Play store [laughs]
Um that was sort of a new
experience for me, I borrowed

00:19:14.954,00:19:20.893
that idea off of CCC um we’ve
had troubles in the past with
Android having such a large

00:19:20.893,00:19:25.297
ecosystem, it’s really hard to
describe how to configure that
client when it’s different on so

00:19:25.297,00:19:30.803
many devices so this kind of was
a little bit more effort but
made it a lot easier to say, we

00:19:30.803,00:19:33.673
know that you have the profile,
we know that you have the cert,
we know that you’re doing the

00:19:33.673,00:19:39.445
righ- right checking and it’ll
work on pretty much all Android
devices. So um that was

00:19:39.445,00:19:43.983
hopefully something we’re going
to keep uh going into next
year’s. We added more config

00:19:43.983,00:19:48.621
instructions for Linux, I think
we’d only had WPA_supplicant up
to date and we added some other

00:19:48.621,00:19:53.993
stuff um and then Nick and Wish,
you guys want to talk about the,
er Nick and John, you want to

00:19:53.993,00:20:00.433
talk about the Chromebook
profile? >>Yeah >>Sure
[laughter] >>So, Chromebook

00:20:00.433,00:20:05.538
profile is new this year, so
people had been, we saw some
folks complaining on Twitter,

00:20:05.538,00:20:10.142
that we didn’t have the config
for Chromebook and so um how
many people have Chromebooks

00:20:10.142,00:20:15.147
here? Oh, handful of people. So,
so thank John actually, John
stand up. >>Yeah John!

00:20:17.249,00:20:22.254
[applause] Woo! >>Yeah! >>For,
for spending several hours
wrangling with the Chromebooks

00:20:24.723,00:20:30.596
um in order to get that to work
but now it, it works. Yeah
>>Yeah, thanks guys that, we

00:20:30.596,00:20:37.169
were busy doing other WIFI stuff
so they pulled the, pulled up
the slack on that one. Um

00:20:37.169,00:20:43.609
challenges for WIFI, there are
challenges, and funny enough
like we, we think as

00:20:43.609,00:20:47.179
professionals these are not
necessarily WIFI challenges,
that seems to be the easy part,

00:20:47.179,00:20:52.184
but patching is difficult, cable
runs are difficult, um sometimes
we ask for a cable and it’s in

00:20:54.920,00:21:00.192
the middle of some space that it
shouldn’t be there or it needs
twenty feet of gaff tape. As I

00:21:00.192,00:21:03.262
mentioned before that the amount
of drops that we have that we
can actually backhall to the

00:21:03.262,00:21:09.735
switch, not never as many as I
want um POE can be a problem
sometimes, we have POE at every

00:21:09.735,00:21:14.406
one of our switches, but if
you’ve got a bad cable run or
let’s say you terminated

00:21:14.406,00:21:19.612
something wrong on one of the
POE pairs, uh we had, John
fought one of those for a good

00:21:19.612,00:21:25.151
couple hours where the AP comes
up, powers, never, never gets on
to our controller because one of

00:21:25.151,00:21:31.090
the pairs is flipped, and it’s
not something you’d catch unless
you had a tester or you know

00:21:31.090,00:21:36.529
everything looked okay. >>I need
to complain about my. I need to
complain about because I’m sure

00:21:36.529,00:21:40.499
some of you saw me on opening
night in the chill out room
nextdoor in Bally’s trying to

00:21:40.499,00:21:46.071
screw with that access point on
the fifty foot pool. Uh that
thing, and we had three, three

00:21:46.071,00:21:52.511
or four drops like this, AP
comes up, power comes on, so POE
works. It can talk to the

00:21:52.511,00:21:56.916
network, that works fine, it can
talk back to the controller,
that works fine. It sends five

00:21:56.916,00:22:01.687
packets, and it won’t talk
anymore. Like the wires heat up
and suddenly become non

00:22:01.687,00:22:05.257
conductive or something, that’s
the sort of problems we dealt
with and changing out the

00:22:05.257,00:22:09.528
cabling is the only way to, to
deal with that. And sometimes
it’s the last cable in the room

00:22:09.528,00:22:14.233
so the wi- the wireless village
this year was supposed to have
an access point from us, we

00:22:14.233,00:22:18.704
couldn’t, it was the last
possible jack in the room, it
went bad, so we ended up moving

00:22:18.704,00:22:23.709
that out in the hallway. So um
older hotels are no fun for this
sort of thing. >>Yeah the WIFI

00:22:27.146,00:22:32.851
is easy all the other pieces are
hard um the the mounting, if you
guys saw the stands that we have

00:22:32.851,00:22:38.157
out there, a lot of them are
pointed down which is what we
want um some of them we didn’t

00:22:38.157,00:22:43.896
have the little bit that we got
from the Encore folks to kind of
give enough ninety degree angle

00:22:43.896,00:22:48.901
to drop down so we do have some
that are facing, polarized
incorrectly, you’re still

00:22:48.901,00:22:54.473
getting signal, it’s just not
ideal. So mounting is not easy
and each of the different

00:22:54.473,00:22:59.278
properties has different stands,
so you know this would be great
if it was just a single

00:22:59.278,00:23:03.549
property, but we’re kind of
dealing with four different
groups in in some regard and

00:23:03.549,00:23:08.487
that means the mounting may not
be as consistent as we want it.
>>By the way, he mentioned

00:23:08.487,00:23:13.359
Encore, these guys are awesome.
If you are people that hold
conventions uh the Encore folks

00:23:13.359,00:23:18.364
support all the IT for uh for
the hotel >>Woo! [applause]
>>Yeah! >>They have been here uh

00:23:21.267,00:23:26.071
day and night with us uh hanging
out in rooms, watching us plug
cables in and that sort of thing

00:23:26.071,00:23:31.543
but they’re just, they’re
incredible so um those guys plus
Caesar’s IT are wonderful to

00:23:31.543,00:23:37.216
work with. >>Yeah, thanks uh for
mentioning that John an- and
those folks have come back

00:23:37.216,00:23:43.923
working for us, Phil how many
years have you, you say you did
this? >>Uh I worked for Caesar’s

00:23:43.923,00:23:48.127
for fifteen and I think I’ve
done it for at least seven.
>>Yeah, so Phil’s been around

00:23:48.127,00:23:53.899
for seven years. So these guys,
between Phil, Kevin, and uh and
our Encore folks, we, we, they

00:23:53.899,00:23:58.937
are part of the NOC, they they
are here, they ask to come work
with us every year, they, they

00:23:58.937,00:24:04.009
know what we do, they know how
we do it, they are invaluable to
our team >>Cause letting a

00:24:04.009,00:24:09.548
hacker con into your MDFs and
IDFs like what could possibly go
wrong with that so [laughter]

00:24:09.548,00:24:14.953
into uh you know testicular
fortitude. >>Uh let’s see I
think I’ve got everything. Oh

00:24:14.953,00:24:20.292
and the room changes, like I
said, things change, right? And
sometimes, rooms actually change

00:24:20.292,00:24:24.763
during the con and you get
things like this left on the
floor with no access point there

00:24:24.763,00:24:29.001
anymore. So, you know, we have
to be a little bit dynamic in
the morning or even in the

00:24:29.001,00:24:34.206
evening, look, kind of look in
and see what the alerting system
has said, hey your APs are down,

00:24:34.206,00:24:38.577
it’s because an airwall moved
and they >>Those, those pictures
there are from an MGM property,

00:24:38.577,00:24:44.616
[laughter] I just want you to
know that. >>So yeah, it’s
always fun uh you know we don’t

00:24:44.616,00:24:49.021
really get to sit back too much,
there’s always something going
on and we have to address it as

00:24:49.021,00:24:53.492
the con goes on. >>You guys have
done really good this year at
not stealing our APs and we

00:24:53.492,00:24:58.497
appreciate that too [laughter]
>>Keep that up. >>Challenge
accepted. >>Um just some

00:25:00.466,00:25:04.370
miscellaneous thoughts and, you
know, if you guys have questions
this is probably about the time

00:25:04.370,00:25:09.708
for the WIFI questions but.
Everybody blames the WIFI and
the reality is, you know,

00:25:09.708,00:25:15.681
sometimes it is our fault but a
lot of times it’s DNS problems,
it’s DHCP problems um we work

00:25:15.681,00:25:20.419
really hard so that we know our
infrastructure’s solid and
unless you’re in some area that

00:25:20.419,00:25:25.224
doesn’t have our APs, like the
casino floor, you’re not going
to get our WIFI on the casino

00:25:25.224,00:25:28.794
floor. >>That was a complaint
last night >>Yeah, there was a
complaint last night so, in, in

00:25:28.794,00:25:34.566
the conference spaces we are
providing RF, everywhere else,
we are not providing RF. >>Yeah,

00:25:34.566,00:25:39.104
i- is Wookie here? That was the
Twitter user that reported it
last night, that wasn’t working

00:25:39.104,00:25:44.109
on the casino floor [laughter]
>>Now is your chance to throw
something. Alright so uh the

00:25:46.378,00:25:52.117
other thing we we say in the app
had it as a default password,
DefCon DefCon, and we want to

00:25:52.117,00:25:56.522
just assure you guys, that if
you’re doing the correct
checking in your sublicant

00:25:56.522,00:26:00.726
because of rotating keys, you’re
still secure using the same
password that, that TLS tunnel

00:26:00.726,00:26:07.666
is dynamic per session so you’re
you’re safe if you’ve configured
your end correctly and that’s

00:26:07.666,00:26:14.206
always the sticky part. More
about that. >>Is fart face here?
You downloaded sixteen point two

00:26:14.206,00:26:20.913
gigabytes over the WIFI over the
last three days [laughter] >>We
know what you’re doing >>So

00:26:20.913,00:26:25.918
kudos to fart face I guess
[laughter] And then just in
future planning, so um we really

00:26:29.354,00:26:34.493
would love to get a WPA3 network
out there, potentially next
year. You know there’s still a

00:26:34.493,00:26:39.832
lot of client proliferation that
has to happen um. I kinda want a
stable code base for the Aruba

00:26:39.832,00:26:45.270
controller that will support it
well so that we can offer that
uh and then we also wanna

00:26:45.270,00:26:50.976
potentially do OWE which is,
>>Opportunistic wireless >>There
you go, oppor- opportunistic

00:26:50.976,00:26:55.647
wireless encryption so it’s,
it’s like an open SS ID, no
authentication, but you get

00:26:55.647,00:27:00.586
encryption. So you know try to
move towards using some of these
new technologies that will keep

00:27:02.788,00:27:09.261
the onboarding process simple
for the WIFI, but keep you guys
secure. >>And we, we could have

00:27:09.261,00:27:14.366
done WPA3 this year, we didn't
want to just because the client
situation is still in a bit of

00:27:14.366,00:27:18.937
flux and um that’s likely to
lead, every time there’s a new
generation of kind of WIFI

00:27:18.937,00:27:23.041
capabilities, it leads to
compatibility problems and it
takes a year or two for that to

00:27:23.041,00:27:28.514
sort of work it’s way out so um
we, we kind of made the
executive decision, he did, that

00:27:28.514,00:27:32.451
we’re not going to do it this
year but I think next year we’re
gonna, we’re gonna try. >>Yeah,

00:27:32.451,00:27:36.655
it’s, it’s uh goes back to that
simplicity idea if I turn on
some new advanced feature,

00:27:36.655,00:27:39.491
there’s going to be some devices
that have a hard time with it,
and then can’t get on the

00:27:39.491,00:27:42.995
network and then that’s really
hard to troubleshoot so >>It’s
our fault >>Yeah, and then it’s

00:27:42.995,00:27:46.331
our fault, right? Then, then you
guys come to us and say, hey the
WIFI’s broken and we say well

00:27:46.331,00:27:51.603
you know you’ve got this client
that’s not behaving correctly um
try to avoid that at all

00:27:51.603,00:27:56.608
possible uh cost but once we get
that prolif- proliferation of
devices it should be uh a little

00:28:00.245,00:28:05.050
bit easier to suss those
problems out if they do occur.
>>Alright. >>I think that was my

00:28:05.050,00:28:10.055
last slide, yeah? Okay. Any
other questions? [inaudible off
mic comment] >>Boo! >>Go to

00:28:15.994,00:28:22.901
hell! >>So I I I won’t notice, I
wanna like demonstrate the er
point out the gear sitting on

00:28:22.901,00:28:26.772
stage was a noose up until the
last couple of years where it
got refreshed by stuff that’s

00:28:26.772,00:28:31.877
only slightly less as old
[laughter] um so one of the big
hurdles right now with IPV6 is

00:28:31.877,00:28:36.448
making sure that we can do it in
a secure way which means router
advertisement suppression which

00:28:36.448,00:28:41.887
none of our gear supports right
now. You know IPV6 has been out
there for what thirty years?

00:28:41.887,00:28:46.959
People have been kind of really
deploying it for the last, you
know, five to ten, and you know

00:28:46.959,00:28:51.964
it’s been secured for like the
last uh I don’t know probably
next year [laughter] um so that

00:28:54.666,00:28:59.137
that’s kind of where it’s
sitting uh the, the second thing
is uh all of that would be

00:28:59.137,00:29:04.676
tunneled because none of our
immediate handoffs are V6 uh
upstream. So those are kind of

00:29:04.676,00:29:10.415
the two things right now. So
we’ll go, I’m just going to
point out? >>More questions?

00:29:10.415,00:29:15.420
>>More questions? >>Two
questions, one [question
continues off mic inaudible]

00:29:20.225,00:29:25.364
>>Okay >>Absolutely none
>>[laughs] Yeah so uh so the
firs- the first question is what

00:29:25.364,00:29:30.268
additional privileges do we give
to uh people who put out for the
call for services or put stuff

00:29:30.268,00:29:35.841
on the network uh re- yeah to
the point realistically none. Uh
if anything, we give them less

00:29:35.841,00:29:40.545
privileged from the standpoint
of we allow people to connect
them, which is, you know,

00:29:40.545,00:29:45.550
opening it up, right. >>[off mic
question continues] >>Uh so the
client isolation is really from

00:29:48.954,00:29:52.791
like >>That’s wireless >>Yeah,
that’s, yeah that’s strictly
wireless to wireless >>Let’s

00:29:52.791,00:29:58.497
talk about VLANs, how many VLANs
we have like each podium has a
different VLAN >>Okay so yeah I

00:29:58.497,00:30:04.736
mean from, from the standpoint
of, do you want to answer?
[laughs] >>No >>Okay [laughter]

00:30:04.736,00:30:09.541
uh fr- from the the standpoint
of the though uh wired
separation we pretty much

00:30:09.541,00:30:14.579
separate as much as possible.
Every drop coming out of the
wall uh gets its own VLAN

00:30:14.579,00:30:20.519
network- gets its own network
all of that is uh layer 3
controlled, uh stateful firewall

00:30:20.519,00:30:26.792
in between them, and it takes it
from there, so it’s a specific
operation to open something up

00:30:26.792,00:30:31.797
where the like the CFS comes
into play, or the villages and
contests. Over there. [off mic

00:30:43.175,00:30:48.346
question inaudible] >>80211R,
>>Question >>if it didn’t break
the crap, oh I’m sorry, what

00:30:48.346,00:30:54.386
advanced feature did we turn off
that we wish, that we could use?
80211R is a great example, it

00:30:54.386,00:30:59.624
would improve roaming uh it
breaks a lot of devices and
there’s some security

00:30:59.624,00:31:05.697
implications there too um
management frame protection is
another one, that was always the

00:31:05.697,00:31:09.901
hey why aren’t you turning this
on? It’s cause most clients
don’t support it and then they

00:31:09.901,00:31:15.307
cannot connect to the wireless.
>>Discovery protocols. >>We had
a conversation about turning on

00:31:15.307,00:31:20.312
passpoint this year, hotspot 2.0
type stuff where your phones
would have sort of auto

00:31:20.312,00:31:24.516
connected to the network without
you asking them to and we
decided that that would piss a

00:31:24.516,00:31:28.720
lot of people off at DefCon
[laughter] which was kind of the
point but we decided not to do

00:31:28.720,00:31:34.760
that >>Yeah we- >>So John, raise
of hands, who would be pissed
off >>Who would be pissed off if

00:31:34.760,00:31:41.666
we, yeah, so if Home Depot does
it to you though [laughter]
>>We, we’re throwing, we’re

00:31:41.666,00:31:45.003
knocking around the idea of
maybe doing a talk about that
next year so that we could run

00:31:45.003,00:31:49.708
it in a very limited location,
so if you guys came into our
talk, your phones would probably

00:31:49.708,00:31:55.714
get passpointed but uh not on
the full infrastructure. >>There
was a guy over there, had a

00:31:55.714,00:32:00.652
question, yeah, you right there,
got your arm up >>Real simple,
how do you [inaudible question

00:32:09.828,00:32:13.565
off mic continues] >>Gotcha. So
there’s ah, there’s a couple
diffs in uh sorry, dips in the

00:32:13.565,00:32:19.437
uh WIFI user count graphs for
year over year uh and the
question is can we explain those

00:32:19.437,00:32:21.640
>>No >>[laughs] Uh when the
simple comments is no I- I- I’m
trying to remember sometime back

00:32:21.640,00:32:26.645
>>I’m pretty sure DC16 is when
that air pwn thing came out that
I was talking about >>Yeah could

00:32:35.720,00:32:40.725
be the reason >>That was when
they changed the encryption of
the credit cards >>At Riviera

00:32:44.763,00:32:49.768
DC16 and then Rio >>Space >>RIPs
>>Spencer >>Bandwidth [laughter]
>>Spencer! >>One moment please

00:32:53.605,00:33:00.011
while we confer about a proper
answer to give you >>Because of
Spencer [laughter] >>Uh pretty

00:33:00.011,00:33:05.016
much larger space, more APs, not
necessarily people like, p-
people used to be very skeptical

00:33:09.421,00:33:14.860
about connecting to the WIFI
network at DefCon >>Used to be
>>Uh people understood that it

00:33:14.860,00:33:19.865
was okay to do it, right? Um I
think that’s part of it but it’s
not one, one thing. We got year

00:33:22.801,00:33:27.806
by year, we get better segway to
the next slide, uh bandwidth, uh
not great, but we keep trying to

00:33:31.877,00:33:37.315
improve as much as we can, but
if you guys have a great
experience an- and it’s secure,

00:33:37.315,00:33:39.851
right? Secure to the point that
they were talking about. Your
devi- your traffic is, the

00:33:39.851,00:33:44.856
traffic is encrypted, nobody
else can connect to your device
to attack your device, and we

00:33:49.594,00:33:54.566
are not looking at the traffic
that you’re sending I think
that’s fair game for this,

00:33:54.566,00:33:59.571
right? Uh for us, on the other
side, is availab- availability,
right? We don’t want uh people

00:34:02.741,00:34:09.681
like, we want the network up.
The more this works, the more
beers we have. So through, from

00:34:09.681,00:34:15.787
Thursday last week through
Thursday this week, it’s a lot
of work that we do to make it

00:34:15.787,00:34:20.792
work then we hope it doesn’t
break so we can kind of watch
talks and things like that.

00:34:23.161,00:34:29.234
>>One of- one of the suggestions
from our colleagues is that uh
there are alternatives to the

00:34:29.234,00:34:33.672
DefCon network uh particularly,
you know, cellular coverage and
whatnot, and during some of

00:34:33.672,00:34:39.444
these, some of these years there
was uh times where that was
coming out and you could secure

00:34:39.444,00:34:45.216
yourself easier than you could
secure into, you know, your
standard enterprise uh wireless

00:34:45.216,00:34:51.856
network so. Let’s go. >>Ope, you
got a guy straight ahead here,
he’s kind of got his hand up,

00:34:51.856,00:34:56.628
I’m not sure if he’s just
resting it. There you go! Commit
then. No, stand up, no, no, no,

00:34:56.628,00:35:01.866
no, I ain’t gonna listen to your
question, you stand up. There
you go. [off mic question

00:35:01.866,00:35:07.272
inaudible] >>Do we collaborate
with the Black Hat guys like
Grifter? Sharing resources >>No

00:35:07.272,00:35:13.578
I’m going to move my microphone
away [laughter] >>Uh not as much
back when DefCon and Black Hat

00:35:13.578,00:35:18.149
were a lot closer, there was a
lot of, there was some shared
stuff but uh corporate entities

00:35:18.149,00:35:23.221
kind of forced that to be a lot
more separate uh >>The timing
doesn’t line up either at all

00:35:23.221,00:35:29.728
for that >>We, we need to have
our gear here, and running, and
going, the same time Black Hat

00:35:29.728,00:35:34.099
is running so. >>Do we want to
mention that we’re not
sponsored? >>Yeah, we’re, we’re

00:35:34.099,00:35:38.636
also not sponsored, we’re not
funded like Black Hat is >>Yeah
this is beg, borrow, and steal

00:35:38.636,00:35:43.641
>>I know. Alright. We’ll co-
we’ll come back to number two
over here [laughs] [off mic

00:35:47.579,00:35:52.417
question begins] >>Stand up
>>Even though your network is
very much [inaudible] under

00:35:52.417,00:35:57.422
attack, what kind of, how much
do you actually see that
affecting the network, I mean

00:35:59.424,00:36:05.930
like, interesting one off story
that you find of dealing with
malicious hackers on your

00:36:05.930,00:36:12.837
network >>Uh stories about
disaster porn, okay [laughs] so
the question is, given the

00:36:12.837,00:36:17.075
attacks, you know, what are the
attacks we’ve seen, what are
some of the particularly notable

00:36:17.075,00:36:22.080
ones? >>So um you, you mentioned
something that’s very kind of
interesting you said, under,

00:36:25.216,00:36:32.157
undered attacked? Like, like, as
in we’re not attacked? >>No no
>>Is that, is that, is that what

00:36:32.157,00:36:36.561
you’re, really? >>Well I’m
sitting down here you’ve got
plenty of time clearly

00:36:36.561,00:36:41.533
>>[laughs] I’m not sure if you
understand how alerts work
alright? All of our phones here

00:36:41.533,00:36:46.538
could. So um a few years back um
we uh, we ran into an issue uh
with uh a gentlemen uh that was,

00:36:51.476,00:36:56.281
what was he doing in there? Was
he, was it cloning or mimicking?
>>Don’t, don’t spoof any of the

00:36:56.281,00:37:01.219
casino networks. That’s a big,
big, big no no. And uh the short
and skinny of it is is that well

00:37:06.291,00:37:11.329
we’re not attacked directly
maybe um we have to deal with
all the s**t you guys are doing

00:37:11.329,00:37:16.267
on, on that network and it
doesn’t necessarily stay in your
nice little area sometimes,

00:37:16.267,00:37:22.073
somebody learns a new skill set
and they want to try to flex
that out, sorry this is

00:37:22.073,00:37:27.078
difficult to do and this. Um and
uh sometimes, oh s**t, we just
totally screwed Spence um

00:37:32.750,00:37:38.490
[laughter] >>Thank you >>Oooh
that’s a healthy shot, good luck
um [laughter] It’s okay, he is

00:37:38.490,00:37:43.161
actually old enough to drink
folks before anybody brings that
up [laughter] he has been

00:37:43.161,00:37:49.367
carded. Anyways. Um no we uh
we’ll we’ll go around and
occasionally we have to work

00:37:49.367,00:37:54.372
with uh Caesar’s um on helping
mediate some of these issues.
Now internally, Mack? >>Um so I

00:37:57.142,00:38:01.346
mean from the attack’s inter-
like we expect some of the
network to be attacked an- and

00:38:01.346,00:38:05.350
we kind of set it up and let it
go that way, again the open
network, if people are trying to

00:38:05.350,00:38:09.954
attack that, it’s kind of the
nature of what it is, it’s meant
to be that, that playground for

00:38:09.954,00:38:14.993
people to go with. Um then
there’s other things where it’s
like we, you know, there was a

00:38:14.993,00:38:20.932
BGPA hijack a few years ago, not
necessarily anything that we,
you know that affected us er er

00:38:20.932,00:38:26.871
whatnot but yeah we know the
network was going through, you
know, the upstream network was

00:38:26.871,00:38:33.278
going through another provider
um just to demonstrate it as a
talk uh for the most part what

00:38:33.278,00:38:39.751
we, what we look out for are
the, the speakers who have some
demonstration they want to do

00:38:39.751,00:38:45.323
and those are the ones that are-
that are kind of memorable. Um,
lots of gateway attacks, you

00:38:45.323,00:38:50.328
know spoofing, um you know, the
traditional wireless de-auths,
et cetera. Um. >>Why don’t you

00:38:52.931,00:38:56.401
talk about what happened with
eight dot eight dot eight dot
eight this year? >>Talk about

00:38:56.401,00:39:01.339
which one? >>The uh Google DNS.
>>Google DNS, uh so yeah so, to-
to what Sparky was saying is, we

00:39:03.675,00:39:08.479
don’t necessarily you know,
worry about a lot of the attacks
that are directed against us,

00:39:08.479,00:39:13.518
but if someone just happens to
be doing an attack against
outside, hitting up Google,

00:39:13.518,00:39:18.256
hitting up, you know, uh
Microsoft, hitting up any of
those, you know, nice companies,

00:39:18.256,00:39:21.960
they’ll see it as an attack and
they’ll block, you know they’ll
blacklist the- the DefCon egress

00:39:21.960,00:39:26.965
networks. So, its like eh that’s
the nature of it. Um >>Please
don’t do that until tomorrow

00:39:29.868,00:39:34.872
night. >>[laughter] >>So it-
it’s always fun trying to like,
you know, reach out to people we

00:39:37.275,00:39:40.612
know, you know, someone who
knows someone who knows someone
can be like, oh yeah they can-

00:39:40.612,00:39:45.884
they can allow that through. Um,
because sometimes it is you know
an exploratory attack, sometimes

00:39:45.884,00:39:49.988
it’s just, you know we have
thirty thousand people
connecting into this network and

00:39:49.988,00:39:55.860
doing a bunch of stuff and it’s
become the practice recently
that uh, the way to test your

00:39:55.860,00:40:00.231
internet is to ping eight dot
eight dot eight dot eight,
right? Yeah after enough of that

00:40:00.231,00:40:04.936
on the same network, Google’s
like, why are you sending me all
this ICMP? So, [laughter] it

00:40:04.936,00:40:09.941
becomes interesting to test it.
Uh, yeah, and then you know, I
know we’ve also had uh, uh, wifi

00:40:12.377,00:40:16.347
spoofing attacks >>We see WiFi
spoofing, that’s most, I think
that’s the most common thing

00:40:16.347,00:40:22.420
with WiFi, de-auth attacks and
then people will try to clone
the Blackhat- or the uh- sorry,

00:40:22.420,00:40:27.926
DefCon um network or Caesar’s
network or things like that, so
we see duplicate SSIDs in the

00:40:27.926,00:40:32.230
air. Um, it’s- it’s silly, just
don’t that. Because we can see
which room you’re in if you’re

00:40:32.230,00:40:38.002
doing that and if we’re not
drinking or otherwise occupied,
we’ll come and find you. Haven’t

00:40:38.002,00:40:41.039
had to do that much this year,
thank you. >>And if it’s the
Caesar’s stuff, Caesars will

00:40:41.039,00:40:45.510
come and find you and you don’t
want that. >>No, they come with
a lot more people. >>Yeah

00:40:45.510,00:40:50.481
because if we, you know, because
everybody likes to come out and
hey let’s clone the hotel

00:40:50.481,00:40:54.852
networks, you know, put up a
pie, put up something, cherry
pie, pecan pie, I don’t care

00:40:54.852,00:40:59.991
what it is. But uh they get
something rolling, think they’re
cute you know- yeah it’s some

00:40:59.991,00:41:04.929
kind of pie or something,
whatever. I’m not hungry, shut
up. >>We’re slowly getting

00:41:04.929,00:41:09.801
drunker and drunker up here.
>>[laugher] >>So yeah, so what
they do is, you know, they do a

00:41:09.801,00:41:13.705
one letter off and they try to
get everybody else to try and
authenticate to it because they

00:41:13.705,00:41:18.509
don’t put no encryption on it.
Uh, we’re we’re we’re we’re
better than that we- >>Uh, from

00:41:18.509,00:41:24.582
the back row there, basically
the explanation there was you’re
an effing retard. If you start

00:41:24.582,00:41:29.954
trying to pretend you’re Caesars
and wander around the floor, um,
there’s a probability that

00:41:29.954,00:41:35.059
somebody is going to notice, and
they’re going to send a lot of-
lot of dudes who you just don’t

00:41:35.059,00:41:40.465
want to visit you, to come see
you. >>Don’t- don’t sit like,
like in one of the big bathroom

00:41:40.465,00:41:46.204
stalls and do this, because I’ll
just dump water over the door.
And you know, it’ll be cold, it

00:41:46.204,00:41:49.073
won’t be hot water, it’s going
to be cold, you’re going to
probably pee yourself two or

00:41:49.073,00:41:53.544
three times while you’re sitting
there but >>[laughter] >>So, I’m
going to regret saying this but

00:41:53.544,00:41:59.984
yes, please focus your attack
attention on us, not on Caesars
>>[laughter] >>Hey you heard it

00:41:59.984,00:42:05.556
here first folks >>[Applause]
>>We’re taking a bullet for
Caesars. >>Yeah, and I’m going

00:42:05.556,00:42:10.094
to amend that by saying if-
don’t attack our wireless
network, go to the wireless

00:42:10.094,00:42:16.067
village and attack their
network. >>Aw yeah! >>[Laughter
and Applause] >>Next question

00:42:16.067,00:42:21.072
>>Next question, um. No on the
same token, it’s like again,
802. 1X we make it as easy as we

00:42:23.341,00:42:29.280
can for you to use, right.
Eight- we don’t expect you to
understand it, 802. 1X, it’s not

00:42:29.280,00:42:32.884
that complicated but it’s not
that simple if you’re not a
wireless networking person.

00:42:32.884,00:42:39.190
That’s fine. But last year, I
was at Caesar’s going from my
room to the NOC, and I’m walking

00:42:39.190,00:42:44.028
by the buffet, if you were
there, and some guy is on his
laptop walking, and I’m like,

00:42:44.028,00:42:49.700
whoa, you get- you get signal
here? He’s like, what? Yeah! I’m
like from the DefCon network,

00:42:49.700,00:42:54.572
he’s like no. F no, I don’t use
that network. I’m like, but
you’re on the internet. He’s

00:42:54.572,00:42:58.643
like yeah, I’m using the hotel
WiFi. I’m like, the open one?
He’s like yeah! I’m like, right

00:42:58.643,00:43:03.581
on. >>[Laughter] >>Wall of sheep
right there, wall of sheep.
>>Let’s go, you have your hands

00:43:08.820,00:43:13.825
up. Yep >>There you go. >>[Off
mic, inaudible] >>Yeh how far
out in advance to we do planning

00:43:16.227,00:43:21.232
and design for the network >>Uh,
the call is at what, a week
after we leave here? First call?

00:43:23.367,00:43:28.739
>>Yeah >>Alright so um, on
average we do, mmm I want to
say, well we should be doing…

00:43:28.739,00:43:32.777
>>Eight months >>Yeah, about
eight months our we eventually
pull or shit together and get on

00:43:32.777,00:43:37.782
the phone. Um, we actually go to
an amazing conference, some of
us, uh, out of Chicago, >>Woo!

00:43:39.951,00:43:44.956
>>Uh, called ThotCon
>>{Cheering} >>Oh yeah, maybe
you recognize Nick, uh, and we

00:43:48.726,00:43:53.397
go there and a lot of us meet up
there beforehand and uh, and do
a little bit of planning. And

00:43:53.397,00:43:58.402
uh, uh- uh- it’s got an amazing
VIP section um. >>I- I do the
planning, you guys are there

00:44:00.571,00:44:03.741
drinking. >>Oh yeah that’s
actually- that’s right. >>I’ve
got another wireless network to

00:44:03.741,00:44:10.281
run. >>Yeah, yeah, Colin also is
an oper over there and uh, yeah,
we- we- most of us just get

00:44:10.281,00:44:16.787
trashed and- shoutout >>Shoutout
to Morgan and Videoman for the
wireless at ThotCon. >>So pretty

00:44:16.787,00:44:21.792
much tomorrow, all of us- all of
us, are going to know where
DefCon 28 is going to be at.

00:44:24.195,00:44:28.366
That’s when we start planning.
If it is the same thing, we kind
of know what we’re doing and

00:44:28.366,00:44:34.338
what- what worked and what
didn’t work. If it’s a new
place, or adding more places,

00:44:34.338,00:44:39.343
then around December we start
planning. >>[off mic inaudible]
>>Excuse me, where are you guys

00:44:44.015,00:44:49.020
going? >>[Laughter] >>This talk
is not good enough? >>Uhh >>Awww
>>You in the front there.

00:44:51.656,00:44:58.129
>>Dudes come on >>Booo >>We
don’t suck that bad. >>Shun them
>>We just answered all their

00:44:58.129,00:45:02.967
questions. >>Lots of activities
>>Right here, >>Hey, what’s up?
>>[inaudible off mic]

00:45:02.967,00:45:09.907
>>[Applause] >>We got one of the
guys that do the garbage dumps,
he’s just in there watching

00:45:09.907,00:45:15.413
stuff, he can’t touch nothing.
>>Hotel hoarder right now >>Yeah
what- what’s covered now, uh I

00:45:15.413,00:45:20.117
mean, to a degree we have some
monitoring telling us, you know,
what is or isn’t going, and- and

00:45:20.117,00:45:25.556
there is a whole lot of Twitter
that would tell us what is or is
not going on so. >>[Laughter]

00:45:25.556,00:45:30.194
>>My phone is on mute now so I
don’t know. John, do you have a
question? >>I did have a

00:45:30.194,00:45:35.199
question uh I was curious what’s
the- >>Go up >>Go up >>Go up!
>>[inaudible] >>Dude you’re like

00:45:41.205,00:45:47.745
ten feet away, come on.
>>[indistinct chatter] >>I was
just curious, what’s the setup

00:45:47.745,00:45:52.750
like between here and Flamingo,
and, right? Because there is a
bunch of vLANs, and maybe it’s

00:45:54.819,00:46:01.258
all two, maybe it’s all three.
Like how do people at Flamingo
talk to servers back here?

00:46:01.258,00:46:07.632
>>Alright, plant um [laughs] so
>>Sorry >>oh we’ll skip through
some of these, where are they,

00:46:07.632,00:46:14.405
oh yeah, good pictures. Alright
[laughter] we’ll come back to
those, you can ask, if you wanna

00:46:14.405,00:46:20.378
see those other pictures, ask
questions. There we go. So this
is what the uh this is what the

00:46:20.378,00:46:27.051
current uh Planet Hollywood,
Paris, Bally’s connection looks
like. Um all of it is the same

00:46:27.051,00:46:31.555
layer si- layer two segments, we
have physical connections
between all of these properties

00:46:31.555,00:46:38.229
that we can extend all of our
vLANs too um. >>Sorry, can you
point to where the Flamingo is

00:46:38.229,00:46:43.701
on that map? >>So the Flamingo
is over here [laughter] >>Oh
>>Uh i- it >>Show me the

00:46:43.701,00:46:50.574
keyhole! >>Heh, Yeah [laughter]
>>Where is the keyhole?! >>Where
is the keyhole?! >>I- It is a a

00:46:50.574,00:46:55.112
smaller property um and
unfortunately it is not layer 2
connected over there so what we

00:46:55.112,00:46:59.950
do is we basically stand up an
IPSEC tunnel between the two
properties, we have divided

00:46:59.950,00:47:04.955
route domains such that, you
know, the, the hollywood cord,
hollywood cord network um has

00:47:07.191,00:47:11.562
one set of networks and the
Flamingo has another set of
networks and we do a lot of uh

00:47:11.562,00:47:17.735
cross traffic, a lot between
those, so WIFI reg is sitting in
this building for instance, um

00:47:17.735,00:47:22.773
so someone over in Flamingo
signing up would, you know, come
up to the firewall, hop across

00:47:22.773,00:47:27.778
the IPSEC tunnel and then drop
down into our WIFI reg um. So
yeah. Other questions?

00:47:32.383,00:47:37.388
>>[inaudible off mic
question][laughter] >>Well what
would you want to know about the

00:47:41.659,00:47:47.932
other images? >>They look so
interesting! [speaker laughs]
>>Ope! We got a guy. Stand up,

00:47:47.932,00:47:53.637
stand up! >>[inaudible off mic
question] >>Oh, oh, wow >>Oh!
Well thank you for asking!

00:47:53.637,00:47:59.610
>>Could someone? Who would like
to talk about the floor?
>>Repeat the question! >>Ah, so

00:47:59.610,00:48:03.247
the question was, what do uh,
you know, we never have a
problem, we talked about the,

00:48:03.247,00:48:08.552
the infrastructure uh and like
how many lines go to particular
places and then once you get to

00:48:08.552,00:48:12.523
that place you have to plug into
the wall somewhere so we have a
bunch of pictures of what it’s

00:48:12.523,00:48:17.528
like to plug into the wall at
some of these properties, or the
floor, so sorry. >>Before we do

00:48:17.528,00:48:22.266
this um we, we- we’d, like to
say we actually really like
Caesar’s and we enjoy their

00:48:22.266,00:48:28.672
company >>Yeah it’s, it really
is a stuff builds over time and,
and these are the way properties

00:48:28.672,00:48:33.711
become, everyone’s like this,
right? Phil is that enough of a
back track? >>Yeah >>[laughs]

00:48:33.711,00:48:38.716
Alright Nick, I think, you >>So,
some of us have to go around
and, and test um drops all over

00:48:41.419,00:48:47.558
the different properties and I
took this photo um that’s a
quesadilla [laughter] down in

00:48:47.558,00:48:54.465
there and this was in Planet
Hollywood um in the Celebrity
Ballrooms and >>But Nick, what

00:48:54.465,00:48:59.904
would you eat a quesadilla with?
>>And then I went to the next
one, and there was a fork

00:48:59.904,00:49:06.510
[laughter] in the floor pocket
and we’ve we’ve, over the years
we’ve found also things like um

00:49:06.510,00:49:11.515
shoes, um underpants, um random
pills, and candy from God knows
when. >>It’s the real DefCon

00:49:16.053,00:49:21.058
scavenger hunt >>Candy
[laughter] >>Step one is collect
underpants >>Alright, other

00:49:23.460,00:49:28.466
questions? [laughter] Yes ma’am
[inaudible off mic question]
Yeah so the question is how do

00:49:38.242,00:49:44.081
we secure the physical aspect
of, of all of our networking
gear >>Duct tape! >>Duct, duct

00:49:44.081,00:49:49.086
tape [laughter] >>Duct tape
>>Most of us are viciously,
viciously a**holeishness

00:49:51.689,00:49:56.694
>>Bazooka bubblegum >>We try to
keep it away from you guys
[laughter] as much as we can,

00:50:00.297,00:50:06.070
right? The distribution switch
is core switches it’s everything
like and within like unreachable

00:50:06.070,00:50:12.243
places even to us, we have to be
with Encore or the hotel to be
there but access points and

00:50:12.243,00:50:17.147
everything else, it’s a
crapshoot, right? It depends on
the property that we were at.

00:50:17.147,00:50:22.152
Alexis Park was fun uh Riviera
was much easier because they had
no wall jacks at all so the

00:50:25.189,00:50:30.194
picture that we saw around uh
here. The background picture is
a wireless controller that

00:50:34.999,00:50:41.205
provides power over ethernet.
>>It’s right there >>Yeah,
>>Well >>Right there for them,

00:50:41.205,00:50:46.210
um to all the APs that we had.
So the APs were in the ceiling,
that’s what he complained about

00:50:46.210,00:50:50.514
because the APs were too high,
but hey, nobody’s going to steal
them, or unplug em and try to do

00:50:50.514,00:50:55.519
something bad. And other places
like the Rio that if you were
there, the, the hallway that it

00:50:58.489,00:51:03.560
would lead all the way to the
back there everything like as
reachable, right? So how can we

00:51:03.560,00:51:09.333
secure that? Some of them we do
like port secure, I guess? Some
of them like we can’t, right?

00:51:09.333,00:51:15.773
And good or bad we’re still sort
of humans and we do
misconfigurations and things

00:51:15.773,00:51:20.844
like that so it happened before,
one of the oops! moments is like
people are like, Oh we hacked

00:51:20.844,00:51:25.616
you! it’s like, cool, what did
you do? Oh I plugged and I saw
all of your access points. It’s

00:51:25.616,00:51:30.220
like, fair enough, right?
Because we have a vLAN for all
of the access points and the

00:51:30.220,00:51:34.391
port that we told you guys to
use, instead of going to the
internet, was seeing all the

00:51:34.391,00:51:39.396
access points. Sure you could
DDoS and bring down all of the
APs but fair fair game I guess.

00:51:43.534,00:51:49.573
>>Yeah and while you’re sitting
there unplugging the AP and
plugging your own s**t in, we’re

00:51:49.573,00:51:55.612
watching that through the
monitoring on either Labor MNS
or um Airwave anyways so we know

00:51:55.612,00:52:01.385
what’s going on >>Yeah you tell
em Spencer [laughter] >>Your
eliteness will only last so long

00:52:01.385,00:52:06.657
>>Worst balls Spence! >>If, if
you, if you do want to hack WIFI
gear my company has >>What was

00:52:06.657,00:52:10.060
the guy >>Bug bounty program
>>Trashed so please do that
[laughter] but not here

00:52:10.060,00:52:15.065
[laughter] >>Alright so we got
uh seven minutes left uh
>>We’re, we’re like good enough

00:52:18.302,00:52:24.942
>>We have 37 minutes left
[laughs] >>Um 7, we, we have 7
>>Thank you to, to DCTV um

00:52:24.942,00:52:31.382
>>Yeah! [cheers] DC stand up DC!
[applause] >>Nothing but love
for DCTV um >>Stand up! >>But

00:52:31.382,00:52:37.988
there are other departments at
this conference just us putting
that out there um and yeah,

00:52:37.988,00:52:42.893
stand up, give em a round of
applause over there, there we go
[applause] >>Woo! >>Yeah yeah

00:52:42.893,00:52:47.564
yeah yeah yeah yeah that’s
enough, that’s enough. Um
[laughs] there are other

00:52:47.564,00:52:52.636
departments, you know, I’m
looking at SOC, uh speaker ops,
there’s like you know, a few

00:52:52.636,00:52:57.641
other ones, just saying. >>Ouch!
>>Alright >>Thank you >>Oh. Okay
so we’ll say one last question,

00:53:02.079,00:53:08.419
who wants to go out on a good
one? If you’re holding your hand
up, yeah! You have a purpose

00:53:08.419,00:53:14.892
[laughter] >>What are some of
the containers legends
[inaudible off mic question

00:53:14.892,00:53:19.229
continues] >>Alright, what are
the legends that we pass down
through the NOC team? >>Cover

00:53:19.229,00:53:24.234
the ground! [laughter] >>Uncle
Sparky, can you tell us a story?
[laughter] >>Uh I’m gonna uh

00:53:27.638,00:53:33.377
probably pass this on to others
just because uh at Drunk Hacker
History uh is where you come to

00:53:33.377,00:53:38.382
get all of the amazing
historical stories. >>There you
go >>No uh some of the, the uh

00:53:40.784,00:53:47.725
history, some of the past, um
things have changed dramatically
um since we started this little

00:53:47.725,00:53:54.631
party um back in the day we
used, you know, uh crappy
d'links and um we used to race

00:53:54.631,00:53:59.470
the scissor lifts [laughter]
this is like well before uh
safety and unions um [laughter]

00:53:59.470,00:54:04.341
>>I don’t think it was >>uh no
no it was pretty, pretty, pretty
well back there um [laughter] we

00:54:04.341,00:54:09.346
uh uh- plug the switches? What
switches? >>What? >>No no no no
>>Oh the switches to give away,

00:54:13.183,00:54:18.388
oh yeah, I’m like f**k man jes-
we’re like two thi- two thirds
of us are trashed and I’m on

00:54:18.388,00:54:24.628
that part of that [laughter] um
no uh some of the history um
some of the things we used to do

00:54:24.628,00:54:30.200
in the past is um we the
bathroom idea, there you go. Um
somebody asked about physical

00:54:30.200,00:54:35.706
security, well it was locked in
the s**tter. So um it really uh,
do you have a picture of that?

00:54:35.706,00:54:40.611
>>There is a picture >>Yeah. So
I ju- just before we go there, I
just wanna say >>Sorry, are we

00:54:40.611,00:54:46.717
skipping ahead? >>Well no I’m
just like DC17 uh Wired did uh a
spread on us and there were a

00:54:46.717,00:54:50.621
lot of things like even some of
these switches show up in the,
in the Wired spread but one of

00:54:50.621,00:54:55.626
the things that they really
wanted to point out over at the
Riviera was an IDF [laughter]

00:54:58.061,00:55:02.533
>>Yeah, yeah >>Yeah you can see
>>Um it makes working those long
hours a little bit more

00:55:02.533,00:55:07.538
comfortable [laughter] >>Right
over here ope, sorry >>Um back
in the day uh all the the tape

00:55:09.773,00:55:15.412
that would be gaffed down um I
would just drink a bottle uh
cause it works really good in a

00:55:15.412,00:55:20.050
gaff roll so you can just hold
on to it and roll it out >>Yeah
that’s why you were drinking the

00:55:20.050,00:55:24.388
bottle [laughter] >>Yeah well
that was it, yeah. Um that also
made for so- a lot of wavy lines

00:55:24.388,00:55:30.561
so uh it’s nice that we have
professionals that do this now
uh as opposed to us. >>K,

00:55:30.561,00:55:34.631
alright >>You guys laugh about
that toilet, it’s probably the
cleanest one on the whole

00:55:34.631,00:55:41.271
property that [laughter] Sparky
had access to and you didn't.
>>Yeah, have you got anything

00:55:41.271,00:55:45.909
else? >>Nope. Five minutes
though >>Oh, alright. Well, so
that’s it, we’re gonna do, we’re

00:55:45.909,00:55:51.181
gonna give away history here so
um before we do that I just
wanna say, thank you for coming

00:55:51.181,00:55:57.421
to the talk, thank you for being
a part of DefCon and using the
network. Um we do this for you

00:55:57.421,00:56:02.192
and it is it does feel really
good to see it in use and see
what's going on even with all

00:56:02.192,00:56:07.197
the challenges [applause] >>And
and before you guys leave, some
of these switches were in Wired

00:56:11.468,00:56:15.172
magazine so uh, you know,
