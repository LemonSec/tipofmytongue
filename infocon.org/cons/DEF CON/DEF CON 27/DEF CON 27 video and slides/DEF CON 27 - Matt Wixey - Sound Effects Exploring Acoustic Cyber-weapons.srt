>>This is Sound Effects,
Exploring Acoustic Cyber-Weapons
with Matt Wixey. [audience

00:00:12.446,00:00:15.449
cheers and applauds] >>Ok uh hi
everyone. Yes so this is sound
effects exploring acoustic

00:00:15.449,00:00:20.454
cyber-weapons. Uh my name is
Matt Wixey, I lead security
research for PWC UK cyber

00:00:20.454,00:00:25.259
security practice. Uh I’m also a
part time PHD student at
University College London which

00:00:25.259,00:00:29.930
is there, where this work comes
from. Uh prior to joining PWC I
worked in law enforcement in the

00:00:29.930,00:00:34.568
UK for a few years. And
previously spoken uh at Black
Hat and DefCon and other cons as

00:00:34.568,00:00:40.274
well. So a few disclaimers
before we get started, this work
was undertaken as part of my PHD

00:00:40.274,00:00:45.145
research at UCL. Uh it wouldn't
have been possible without my
supervisors and co-authors for

00:00:45.145,00:00:49.549
this project, uh Professor Shane
Johnson and Professor Emiliano
De Cristofaro. Uh what you’re

00:00:49.549,00:00:55.155
gonna see here is presented for
educational purposes only and
um, you’ll also notice

00:00:55.155,00:01:00.761
throughout this talk that I
mention uh words like caveat and
possibly and potentially quite a

00:01:00.761,00:01:04.765
lot. Um that’s kinda for two
reasons, the first is not to
kinda spread uh fear,

00:01:04.765,00:01:09.202
uncertainty and doubt about the
topic of this talk but also
because this is really early

00:01:09.202,00:01:15.075
first aide research in an area
where there is also uh a really
blurred line between correlation

00:01:15.075,00:01:20.047
and causation so that's why
those caveats are there. So why
this talk? Why this subject? Uh

00:01:20.047,00:01:25.919
so a couple a years ago at
DefCon I did a talk called see
no evil, hear no evil which was

00:01:25.919,00:01:31.625
about uh using light and sound
uh to exfiltrate data and mess
with drones and bypass air gaps

00:01:31.625,00:01:37.130
and that kinda thing. And as a
result of that kinda got really
interested in uh in ultrasound

00:01:37.130,00:01:43.103
and infrasound, kind of
unconventional uh uses of sound
generally. So why should you

00:01:43.103,00:01:47.240
care about this talk and this
topic? Uh potentially it’s a
novel class of attack which we

00:01:47.240,00:01:52.646
have done some exp, uh empirical
experimentation on. Uh it’s an
increasing attack surface as

00:01:52.646,00:01:57.351
well. Uh and it builds on
previous work on malware and
physical harm, acoustic harm

00:01:57.351,00:02:02.289
more generally, and uh digital
physical crossover attacks. So a
brief bit of background. Um,

00:02:04.358,00:02:09.129
probably kinda one of the
earliest uh one of the early
examples of digital physical

00:02:09.129,00:02:15.302
malware was Stuxnet, obviously
in 2010. Um also things like
Mirai, uh the IOT botnet. Um,

00:02:15.302,00:02:20.474
more recently some work that was
done on things like MRI
machines. Um there have been

00:02:20.474,00:02:26.713
examples pri, um prior to those
of malware uh accidently uh or
inadvertently affecting physical

00:02:26.713,00:02:31.718
kit so the Conficker worm in
2008 infected uh hospital
equipment as did Wannacry to

00:02:31.718,00:02:36.289
some extent. Uh there have been
um vulnerabilities found in
medical implants, things like

00:02:36.289,00:02:41.128
pacemakers, insulin pumps, that
sort of thing. Um and various
vulnerabilities in vehicles as

00:02:41.128,00:02:44.865
well which potentially would
allow an attacker to take
control of them um and

00:02:44.865,00:02:50.103
eventually cause harm. But
typically with kind of research
there’s an indirect relationship

00:02:50.103,00:02:56.143
between the attack, the effect
uh, and the, uh potential harm
it’s caused. And to some extent

00:02:56.143,00:03:01.248
what my research focuses on is
trying to take out um one of
those steps and instead looking

00:03:01.248,00:03:06.486
at malware or attacks that can
directly affect human beings
either psychologically or

00:03:06.486,00:03:11.091
physically. Uh and some examples
of the kind of things that would
fall under that bracket, uh

00:03:11.091,00:03:17.264
would be Kevin Poulsen’s report
in 2008 on attackers who
uploaded uh flashing gifs to an

00:03:17.264,00:03:22.035
epilepsy support forum. Uh and
those gifs flashed in patterns
consistent with those known to

00:03:22.035,00:03:26.339
induce uh photosensitive
epileptic seizures and a number
of people had seizures as a

00:03:26.339,00:03:33.346
result. Uh, similarly, uh
Oluwafemi and others in 2013 and
Ronen and Shamir in 2016 looked

00:03:33.346,00:03:38.819
ay hacking smart light bulbs. Uh
and specifically found that they
could make those flash again in

00:03:38.819,00:03:43.590
patterns consistent with uh
photosensitive epileptic
seizures. More recently, Rios

00:03:43.590,00:03:48.595
and Butts in 2017 uh in their
kind of um uh ongoing research
on IOT vulnerabilities found

00:03:50.730,00:03:55.735
that they could uh attack an IOT
carwash um and cause it to
strike a human being. So when

00:03:59.639,00:04:04.177
you think about sound as a
weapon, um this isn’t my chart,
um this is a kind of pretty

00:04:04.177,00:04:09.116
simplistic view uh of how long
you should be exposed to sounds
at certain levels. Um now this

00:04:09.116,00:04:13.453
uses decibels. Decibels is an
often misunderstood measure of
sound because it’s not an

00:04:13.453,00:04:17.157
absolute measure, it’s a
relative measure. Depends how
far away you are from the source

00:04:17.157,00:04:21.895
of the sound. But you can see
when you get up to something
like 115 decibels, really you

00:04:21.895,00:04:25.866
can only be exposed to it for
around 30 seconds before either
temporary or permanent harm

00:04:25.866,00:04:31.671
starts to occur. And another
chart, again not mine, just
shows you kind of where some of

00:04:31.671,00:04:36.676
these sounds are categorized in
terms of the effects they can
have. Um, so starting with um

00:04:38.945,00:04:43.250
[audience laughs] starting with
uh 50 decibels um you have a
floor fan which is kind of

00:04:43.250,00:04:47.754
background noise. Lawn mower and
chainsaw, possibly damaging
sounds, again depends how close

00:04:47.754,00:04:53.793
you are to it. A jet taking off,
uh again depending how close you
are it could cause pain. Um 200

00:04:53.793,00:04:59.966
decibels potentially could be an
instant death. And then the
loudest sound known to humanity

00:04:59.966,00:05:04.905
is the Windows XP startup sound.
[audience laughs] Ok so um,
acoustics and harm and

00:05:07.307,00:05:12.245
perceptibility. So what can we
hear? So you’ve probably heard
the terms ultrasound and

00:05:12.245,00:05:17.417
infrasound before. And
traditionally they’re defined as
being sounds which either above

00:05:17.417,00:05:23.323
or below uh human thresholds of
hearing. Traditionally that
threshold is 20 hertz to 20

00:05:23.323,00:05:29.563
kilohertz. Um however it’s a bit
of a misconception um as we’ll
see you can’t kind of put these

00:05:29.563,00:05:34.501
arbitrary cutoff points here. Um
threshold is very widely and it,
depends a lot from person to

00:05:34.501,00:05:40.507
person what frequencies we’re
able to hear at what stage in
your life as well. Uh in, in

00:05:40.507,00:05:46.012
this talk if you see HFN, high
frequency noise, that means
between 17-21 kilohertz. So from

00:05:46.012,00:05:51.017
near ultrasound, just above true
ultrasound. And if you see LFN
that means 60 to 100 hertz. The

00:05:55.322,00:05:59.659
problem with um with ultrasound
and infrasound is that basing a
definition on a lack of a

00:05:59.659,00:06:05.198
property is a problem. Um,
because the mechanisms of people
understanding high and low

00:06:05.198,00:06:10.036
frequencies or perceiving um
high and low frequencies is not
fully understood. People have

00:06:10.036,00:06:16.509
reported being able to hear
sounds as low as 1 point 5 hertz
and as high as 25 kilohertz. Um

00:06:16.509,00:06:21.248
and there’s also been some
research which suggests that at
some level uh we are aware of

00:06:21.248,00:06:25.685
sounds even as high as kind of
40 kilohertz. Whether that’s
kind of consciously or

00:06:25.685,00:06:30.457
subconsciously. And there is a
significant variation in
individuals as to what sounds

00:06:30.457,00:06:33.960
you can hear. It depends on the
volume, it depends on the
background noise, it depends on

00:06:33.960,00:06:38.632
the environment you’re in. So
what the walls are made of for
example. Um, you may perceive

00:06:38.632,00:06:42.269
sounds in different ways to
other people so with low
frequency sounds you may feel it

00:06:42.269,00:06:46.773
more as a vibration than
anything else. Um you may
perceive what are called audible

00:06:46.773,00:06:51.177
subharmonics, which are kind of,
you can think about them as kind
of side effects of a dominant

00:06:51.177,00:06:56.182
frequency. Um and as you um grow
older your ability to hear
higher frequencies declines. Um

00:06:58.418,00:07:02.889
so younger people, children um
are much more likely to be able
to hear higher frequencies than

00:07:02.889,00:07:07.894
adults. Now there have been a
lot of reports here, adverse
effects with high and low

00:07:10.897,00:07:16.102
frequency noise. Um these do
come with a lot of caveats, um
so bear that in mind. Um, the

00:07:16.102,00:07:21.041
susceptibility from person to
person will differ uh, as we
said, um particularly with age

00:07:21.041,00:07:27.314
as well, um there are some
reports to suggest that uh
higher frequencies can have an

00:07:27.314,00:07:31.084
adverse effect on hearing. It
could cause something called a
temporary threshold shift which

00:07:31.084,00:07:37.624
is where your kind of audible
range will uh will shift
temporarily. Um at more uh uh um

00:07:37.624,00:07:42.629
increased volumes and amplitudes
there have been reports of
physiological changes as a

00:07:42.629,00:07:47.334
result of high frequency noise
including things like cardiac
neurosis, hypotension and

00:07:47.334,00:07:52.505
functional changes in
cardiovascular and central
nervous systems. Psychologically

00:07:52.505,00:07:57.143
high frequency noise has been
reported to cause nausea,
fatigue and headaches, tinnitus

00:07:57.143,00:08:01.481
and ear pain, irritation um and
decreased amounts of
concentration. These are

00:08:01.481,00:08:06.953
subjective effects so bear that
in mind. Uh with low frequency
noise it’s um been associated

00:08:06.953,00:08:11.291
with temporary threshold shifts
um with heart ailments and
insomnia and with elevated

00:08:11.291,00:08:16.596
cortisol levels. And
psychologically the most common
uh reported effect of low

00:08:16.596,00:08:22.569
frequency noise is annoyance. Or
irritation. But it has also been
associated with headaches and

00:08:22.569,00:08:27.974
palpitations, uh deterioration
in performance, um depressive
symptoms and distress, and

00:08:27.974,00:08:32.779
interestingly these effects have
been reported even at very
moderate levels of sound. Um so

00:08:32.779,00:08:39.519
somewhere between 40 to fo, 45
decibels. The caveats I
mentioned with all of these

00:08:39.519,00:08:44.791
adverse effects, if you go back
and look at the papers, uh the
date is often anecdotal. Um it’s

00:08:44.791,00:08:49.429
often done through the form of
questionnaires or surveys after
the fact. Uh very easily

00:08:49.429,00:08:54.768
misinterpreted. We don’t always
know uh the noise dose, which is
the um, amount of time that

00:08:54.768,00:08:59.372
someone’s been exposed to these
frequencies and at what level.
Um and many researchers have

00:08:59.372,00:09:03.376
found that these effects are not
reproducible in a lab
environment. Uh and there’s a

00:09:03.376,00:09:07.914
number of reasons why that could
be. Um the first is that there
are ethical restrictions quite

00:09:07.914,00:09:12.519
rightly placed on researchers
exposing human subjects to
sounds which they have good

00:09:12.519,00:09:17.390
reason to believe could cause
harm. Um so in a lab environment
those levels would be attenuated

00:09:17.390,00:09:21.227
um and therefore might not cause
the effects that have been
reported in the literature. The

00:09:21.227,00:09:24.998
other example is that some
people may have experienced
something called a nocebo effect

00:09:24.998,00:09:30.036
so they either believe uh
they've been exposed to a
certain uh level of noise or

00:09:30.036,00:09:34.441
they are being exposed to it and
expireen, the, experiencing
these symptoms but the two might

00:09:34.441,00:09:39.679
not necessarily be related. That
being said, there is a
significant base uh evidence

00:09:39.679,00:09:45.118
base to suggest that in at least
a subset of the population, high
and low frequencies can cause

00:09:45.118,00:09:51.724
some adverse effects. As a
result of that uh a lot of
researchers and organizations

00:09:51.724,00:09:55.695
have developed exposure
guidelines which are uh a
basically kind of a um define

00:09:55.695,00:10:00.633
the maximum levels at which you
should be exposed to sounds of
particular frequencies. Now

00:10:00.633,00:10:05.939
there are problems with these,
uh there are uh big differences
in the way that they’re

00:10:05.939,00:10:10.043
calculated and implemented.
Typically they focus solely on
the workplace. They don’t focus

00:10:10.043,00:10:16.216
on the homes or public spaces or
schools. Um they’re often based
on very small samples and those

00:10:16.216,00:10:20.820
samples are most often uh adult
males. So they don’t take into
account children, for example,

00:10:20.820,00:10:26.826
who as I said can here uh higher
frequencies that are um, much
mo, they’re much more likely to

00:10:26.826,00:10:31.931
hear higher frequencies than
adults. This is a compendium of
some of these guidelines. Uh

00:10:31.931,00:10:36.436
this was compiled by uh an
academic called Timothy
Leighton. And you can see across

00:10:36.436,00:10:40.373
the top you’ve got the various
different frequencies. Now these
are not precise frequencies that

00:10:40.373,00:10:45.578
the sensor of a, a range of
frequencies called a third
octave band um and then on the

00:10:45.578,00:10:49.516
left you can see the uh
guidelines that go all the way
back from the mid 60’s right up

00:10:49.516,00:10:54.153
to 2015. This isn’t necessarily
an exhaustive list but just by
looking at this you can see two

00:10:54.153,00:10:59.592
things. The first is that um, as
you increase the frequency the
maximum exposure goes up to some

00:10:59.592,00:11:03.930
extent. The second is there’s
big disparities between some of
these numbers because they’re

00:11:03.930,00:11:10.003
calculated in different ways. So
just a quick thing on weighting
as well. If you’ve ever done any

00:11:10.003,00:11:14.507
sound measurement you’ll be
familiar with weighting. Uh
sound weighting is a way to

00:11:14.507,00:11:19.746
either attenuate or emphasize
certain frequencies when you’re
doing a measurement of sound. Um

00:11:19.746,00:11:24.417
so A weighting is the most
commonly used if you buy a sound
level meter online or a hardware

00:11:24.417,00:11:28.388
store or somewhere like that, it
will most probably use A
weighting. Um and as you can see

00:11:28.388,00:11:33.026
A weighting uh significantly
underestimates lower frequency
sound um because ih, it kind of

00:11:33.026,00:11:37.397
the curve decays away at the
start. And then uh it works to
underestimate higher frequency

00:11:37.397,00:11:41.868
sound that decays away at the
end. Um C weighting is another
example, you can see there’s

00:11:41.868,00:11:47.140
less of a decay but it still
does decay to some extent. Um
you’ve also got Z weighting

00:11:47.140,00:11:51.744
which is uh mostly what we used
for this experiment because it’s
a flat frequency response so it

00:11:51.744,00:11:56.749
doesn’t attenuate or emphasize.
So um, yea as I said, so with uh
A weighting it’s inappropriate

00:12:00.687,00:12:04.724
for measuring higher frequency
noise because it underestimates
those higher frequencies. Um so

00:12:04.724,00:12:08.962
Z weighting is probably much
more appropriate. With low
frequency noise there are less

00:12:08.962,00:12:13.433
guidelines available, fewer
guidelines available. Um a
possible reason for that might

00:12:13.433,00:12:18.004
be that the main effects of low
frequency noise are subjective
at moderate levels. Um but

00:12:18.004,00:12:21.874
again, even with the ones that
have been published, the
methodology used to calculate

00:12:21.874,00:12:26.913
them and implement them differs
a lot. So uh for this experiment
we used a reference curve

00:12:26.913,00:12:32.685
proposed by Defra which um took
into account a lot of previously
published curves. Um

00:12:32.685,00:12:36.522
measurements of infrasound
specifically use something
called G weighting which is a

00:12:36.522,00:12:41.995
nicer standard specifically for
infrasound. Because we were um
going higher than that we didn’t

00:12:41.995,00:12:47.734
use G weighting. So this is the
uh the guideline for low
frequency noise published by uh

00:12:47.734,00:12:51.804
Moorhouse. Um and as you can see
some of these levels are, are
pretty low um, particularly when

00:12:51.804,00:12:57.043
you get to kind of 50 hertz, 63
hertz um you’re talking about
kind of 43, 42 decibels,

00:12:57.043,00:13:03.116
something like that. [speaker
sniffs] Ok uh so some previous
work looking at sound in

00:13:03.116,00:13:08.121
security research. One of the
most common uh uses of high
frequency noise particularly in

00:13:10.289,00:13:15.128
security research has been as a
covert communications channel.
Um so Deshotels in 2014,

00:13:15.128,00:13:20.566
Hanspach and Goetz also 2014,
looked at kind of covert mesh
networks and how uh devices

00:13:20.566,00:13:24.837
could communicate silently with
each other using high frequency
noise. I at my DefCon talk a

00:13:24.837,00:13:29.842
couple of years ago I did a
similar thing um with eggat
bypasses and exfiltrating data.

00:13:29.842,00:13:34.280
Um and an interesting kind of
finding from a lot of this
research is that many consumer

00:13:34.280,00:13:38.918
devices um are capable of
emitting high frequency noise
even up to kind of ultrasonic

00:13:38.918,00:13:44.791
levels. There’s also been a
research looking at the
disruption of echolocation

00:13:44.791,00:13:50.697
systems which use ultrasound. Um
so again in that DefCon talk I
showed that with drones. Um Yan

00:13:50.697,00:13:55.568
and others in 2016 looked at it
through Tesla vehicles. Um
Bolton and others in 2018 looked

00:13:55.568,00:13:59.639
at corrupting data being written
to hard disk drives using both
high frequency and kind of

00:13:59.639,00:14:03.976
audible audio. And then uh
there’s been a number of studies
on looking at ultrasonic

00:14:03.976,00:14:08.481
tracking beacons as well which
are used for uh for targeted
marketing. So some questions I

00:14:08.481,00:14:14.754
always get asked um before we
kind of get into the, the main
bit of the um, uh the talk.

00:14:14.754,00:14:19.525
First is the brown note. Um I
can, I, I can hear some laughs
so I, I know some people are

00:14:19.525,00:14:23.463
familiar with the brown note. If
you’re not familiar with it,
it’s this kind of mythical tone

00:14:23.463,00:14:27.300
or mythical frequency [speaker
sniffs] that causes people to
lose control of their bowels,

00:14:27.300,00:14:33.573
hence the name. Um, in reality
um no one’s kind of been able to
find this, this mythical

00:14:33.573,00:14:38.578
frequency. Um part of the reason
for that probably is that um any
sound potentially, if it’s loud

00:14:40.580,00:14:44.383
enough, could cause you to feel
sick, could cause your body to
vibrate and potentially have

00:14:44.383,00:14:48.855
that effect. Um but there’s no
kind of one frequency that would
work for everybody. If you’re

00:14:48.855,00:14:52.692
kind of playing sounds at that
volume, you’ve probably got kind
of bigger pr, uh bigger worries

00:14:52.692,00:14:58.498
basically. Um another one I get
asked about as well is the link
between infrasound and the

00:14:58.498,00:15:03.536
paranormal. Um sometimes the
infrasound is referred to as
like the ghost frequency or the

00:15:03.536,00:15:07.874
horror frequency. Um it’s often,
well it’s, it has been used in
things like horror games and

00:15:07.874,00:15:13.146
horror movies as well. Um, I’d
kind of direct you to a couple
of really interesting papers on

00:15:13.146,00:15:19.986
this. Tandy in 2000 and Parsons
and others in 2008 who um looked
at the possibility of infrasound

00:15:19.986,00:15:25.558
at resonant frequencies causing
people to have hallucinations um
also kind of sense a presence in

00:15:25.558,00:15:30.730
areas associated with paranormal
experiences. Um it’s this object
that gets debated a lot um in

00:15:30.730,00:15:35.234
that, in that field but it worth
kind of having a read over. Um
and the last one is the US

00:15:35.234,00:15:41.107
Embassy in Cuba and kind of what
happened there. Um I would
direct you to a paper by Timothy

00:15:41.107,00:15:46.112
Leighton in 2018 which goes into
some detail about um the sounds
that were recorded in that area

00:15:48.147,00:15:54.253
and um the possibility or not of
that being uh a sonic attack. So
when it comes to kind of

00:15:54.253,00:15:57.890
acoustic weapons in general
there are a lot of
misunderstandings around them

00:15:57.890,00:16:02.695
and a lot of myths. Um as
researchers have noted there are
kind of significant practical

00:16:02.695,00:16:08.100
issues associated with actually
deploying them. Um which uh to a
large extent applies to this

00:16:08.100,00:16:12.772
research as well. So the fact
that attackers can cause
something like threshold shifts

00:16:12.772,00:16:16.876
is probably not of interest to
them generally. Um and it’s
really challenging to cause kind

00:16:16.876,00:16:22.715
of directional targeted effects
with acoustic weapons. With low
frequency noise uh that can

00:16:22.715,00:16:27.720
propagate very easily, can
spread over miles potentially.
Um but overseas got very low

00:16:27.720,00:16:32.658
directionality as a result, and
uh you would need to build
massive kind of audio equipment

00:16:32.658,00:16:36.696
to be able to do that. With high
frequency it’s got very low
propagation, it doesn’t deal

00:16:36.696,00:16:40.900
with obstacles well um which is
why it’s used for echolocation
because it bounces off of

00:16:40.900,00:16:45.905
objects. Um so again there’s,
there’s uh an issue there. So um
moving on to our experiment. Um

00:16:48.574,00:16:54.513
so this is kind of how we built
the um uh the hypothesis for
this. So we said, ok given that

00:16:54.513,00:16:59.051
some high frequencies and some
low frequencies might be
imperceptible to at least a

00:16:59.051,00:17:03.823
subset of the population. And
given that above certain levels
they may be associated with

00:17:03.823,00:17:09.362
adverse effects. And given that
some consumer equipment has been
shown that it can uh emit at

00:17:09.362,00:17:13.432
least high frequency noise,
possibly low frequency noise as
well, is it possible, is it

00:17:13.432,00:17:18.170
feasible for an attacker to
develop malware that can cause a
targeted device to emit these

00:17:18.170,00:17:22.975
frequencies at levels exceeding
those in some of these maximum
guidelines and therefore

00:17:22.975,00:17:29.649
potentially cause adverse
effects? So a rough outline of
what we did is we developed uh

00:17:29.649,00:17:35.121
attacks and malware. Pretty kind
of trivial um malware targeted
at certain devices which was

00:17:35.121,00:17:39.759
able to control the system
volume and the speaker output of
those devices and as a result

00:17:39.759,00:17:43.696
play wave files containing
certain frequencies which we
then measured with a sound level

00:17:43.696,00:17:50.603
meter and compared that, that,
compared that output um to
maximum permissible levels. So

00:17:50.603,00:17:54.874
we didn’t use any human subjects
for this experiment, um because
of ethical restrictions uh quite

00:17:54.874,00:17:59.946
rightly. Um we did a full risk
assessment um we had various
safety precautions, we wore ear

00:17:59.946,00:18:04.617
defenders, we used an anechoic
chamber which I’ll talk about in
a bit. Um and we’re not

00:18:04.617,00:18:08.821
releasing either code of the
attacks that we did or the
brands or models that we tested

00:18:08.821,00:18:13.693
these attacks on. So some
scenarios where an attacker
might want to use this, and

00:18:13.693,00:18:17.396
again this is kind of caveatic
quite heavily, um if they were
seeking to affect the

00:18:17.396,00:18:21.334
performance of productivity of
targeted or generally uh
employees or staff of

00:18:21.334,00:18:27.139
organization um or at scale. Um
targeted harassment of certain
individuals or potentially as

00:18:27.139,00:18:32.812
kind of low grade uh cyber
weapons that could have some
physical effect. Uh worth noting

00:18:32.812,00:18:37.883
that, you know, if an attacker
is in a position to execute code
on a device then there are more

00:18:37.883,00:18:41.520
likely going to be things that
they’re more interested in
doing. And even when it comes to

00:18:41.520,00:18:46.058
sound uh there may be things
that they’re more interested in
doing um than this attack so

00:18:46.058,00:18:50.196
they may be more interested in
kind of um, you know, C two
channels with that um or

00:18:50.196,00:18:56.102
something else. So just um a
description of some of the
devices we tested on the left

00:18:56.102,00:19:00.706
hand side. A laptop, a phone, a
bluetooth speaker, a smart
speaker, a pair of over ear

00:19:00.706,00:19:05.644
headphones, uh a vehicle mounted
public address system, a
parametric speaker and a

00:19:05.644,00:19:10.016
vibration speaker. And um you
can see some of the attack
vectors and rather this was kind

00:19:10.016,00:19:16.756
of remote or local. Uh this was
our anechoic chamber. Um has
anyone ever been in an anechoic

00:19:16.756,00:19:22.461
chamber before? Oh wow. Ok quite
a few people. It’s weird, right?
Like, really weird. Um so if you

00:19:22.461,00:19:26.499
havent been, um I really
recommend you, if you get the
chance to do it, do it. Um so

00:19:26.499,00:19:31.303
basically an anechoic chamber is
a sound proofed environment but
it’s designed specifically to

00:19:31.303,00:19:36.275
get rid of echoes. Um so these
kind of wedges on the walls are
fiberglass wedges that, that um

00:19:36.275,00:19:41.113
bounce echoes back and forth
between them so that they
dissipate. Um and essentially

00:19:41.113,00:19:45.885
what this means is you can be in
this room and the ambient noise
level is below the threshold of

00:19:45.885,00:19:51.223
human hearing so it is kind of
one of the quietest places in
the world. Um you can hear your

00:19:51.223,00:19:54.894
own heart beating, if you kind
of move your head you can hear
like your spine creaking in your

00:19:54.894,00:20:00.366
neck. Although that kind of
might be more something that I
should get checked out um

00:20:00.366,00:20:03.836
[speaker and audience laugh] But
um. Yeah. Um so it’s really
cool. Um and what’s kind of

00:20:03.836,00:20:08.874
really kind of creepy and cool
about it is um if you kind of
close your eyes or you turn the

00:20:08.874,00:20:13.646
lights off then uh acoustically
an anechoic chamber is an
infinite space because there’s

00:20:13.646,00:20:20.219
no walls or obstacles to bounce
sound off, uh which I just think
is really cool. Um so for our uh

00:20:20.219,00:20:24.290
Windows malware, which is on
laptops, we embedded these tones
as wave files. We had a really

00:20:24.290,00:20:28.594
trivial C two channel and all
the malware did uh was it would
get a command to play a certain

00:20:28.594,00:20:33.265
frequency, it would increase the
system volume of the laptop to
100 percent, play the tone for

00:20:33.265,00:20:37.803
10 minutes and then restore the
volume afterwards. Android
malware did exactly the same

00:20:37.803,00:20:43.476
thing. Our smart speaker, uh the
one we used had a known
vulnerability um that allowed us

00:20:43.476,00:20:47.746
to control the audio. So for
this to work in practice the
attacker would need to either be

00:20:47.746,00:20:53.486
on the local network um or
attack an exposed speaker on the
internet or do DNS rebinding or

00:20:53.486,00:20:57.923
something like that. Um there
was a python script we used to
scan for speakers on the local

00:20:57.923,00:21:01.494
network and if inactive stream
returned from an attacker
control web server. The

00:21:01.494,00:21:07.266
headphones, um were over ear
headphones connected to laptop
over bluetooth. Because they’re

00:21:07.266,00:21:12.404
headphones we placed these much
closer to the sound level meter.
Uh we had vibration speakers

00:21:12.404,00:21:15.741
which are really cool if you
haven’t used these before. Um so
these don’t have a diaphragm

00:21:15.741,00:21:20.279
cone. Instead they have like a
coil on a movable plate so
whatever surface you use,

00:21:20.279,00:21:25.050
whatever surface you put them
on, that becomes um the kind of
the source of the sound if you

00:21:25.050,00:21:30.322
like. Um parametric speakers,
again these are really cool if
you get a chance to play with

00:21:30.322,00:21:35.227
these. So these use ultrasonic
carrier wavs at 40 kilohertz. Um
meaning that you can use them

00:21:35.227,00:21:40.399
for kind of qua, high intensity
directional audio. So kind of
like a beam of sound. Um the one

00:21:40.399,00:21:45.137
we tested didn't have smart
capabilities. Um but given that
it is fairly low profile and

00:21:45.137,00:21:49.375
fairly uh low cost and that it
can be directional, it might be
attractive to an attacker as

00:21:49.375,00:21:54.280
like a portable acoustic-weapon.
Um a vehicle mounted public
address system. So this didn’t

00:21:54.280,00:21:59.084
have any network uh interfaces
instead it also plays audio from
an inserted storage device you

00:21:59.084,00:22:04.023
would need physical access um to
it. Some additional attacks that
we thought of but didn’t test,

00:22:06.492,00:22:12.665
the first is using uh the HTML5
audio tag to autoplay audio. Um
so this would involve like uh a

00:22:12.665,00:22:17.403
social engineering attack with
an attacker getting a victim to
uh a website and have the sound

00:22:17.403,00:22:21.974
play automatically. Um this
would obviously depend on the,
the currently set system volume.

00:22:21.974,00:22:26.879
Um so not guaranteed to work.
And then [speaker clears throat]
we also used um manipulation of

00:22:26.879,00:22:31.083
pre-existing audio. So this
would be uh either something
where an attacker has access to

00:22:31.083,00:22:34.720
like your uh I guess your music
collection or something or where
they’re kind of creating a

00:22:34.720,00:22:38.390
YouTube video that they know
people are gonna watch. And what
you would do here is take the

00:22:38.390,00:22:43.696
legitimate audio, lower the
amplitude of it and then insert
a very high amplitude, uh high

00:22:43.696,00:22:48.867
frequency or low frequency sound
um which would look like this uh
second picture here. So the kind

00:22:48.867,00:22:53.105
of intended effect of this is
that the victim, uh using their
headphones or speakers or

00:22:53.105,00:22:56.642
whatever, would turn the sound
up so they can hear the
legitimate audio and then

00:22:56.642,00:23:01.547
inadvertently expose themselves
to high levels of whatever
frequency it is. Uh just another

00:23:01.547,00:23:07.386
illustration of that there. So
for measurement we use class one
sound level meters. Um these are

00:23:07.386,00:23:11.890
precision grade, they’re spot
calibrated, uh they’re really,
really expensive to buy um but

00:23:11.890,00:23:16.996
we hired them. Um so we hired
one for the low frequencies, one
for the um uh high frequencies.

00:23:16.996,00:23:23.669
Um and if you ever feel like you
don’t have enough excitement in
your life, um have uh a courier

00:23:23.669,00:23:28.173
call you and tell them that they
don't have any record of you
sending this stuff back um and

00:23:28.173,00:23:32.444
that you might owe a company
20,000 pounds and it puts
everything else in, in

00:23:32.444,00:23:37.716
perspective. [audience laughs]
Um so we placed each device in
the anechoic chamber with our

00:23:37.716,00:23:42.821
sound level meter and in viral
attacks we played certain
frequencies um for 10 minutes.

00:23:42.821,00:23:46.759
We also measured the surface
temperature of each device
before and after the attack

00:23:46.759,00:23:51.463
because there was some anecdotal
evidence that um, or some uh
anecdotes to suggest that

00:23:51.463,00:23:55.167
particularly with higher
frequencies, devices could heat
up if they were playing high

00:23:55.167,00:23:59.972
frequency noises. So we used Z
weighting for the measurement.
Um the only thing we didn't use

00:23:59.972,00:24:04.143
Z weighting for was for
measurements at 21 kilohertz
because that’s outside the range

00:24:04.143,00:24:09.448
of uh Z weighting so we used the
proprietary high pass filter for
that. And these are the results

00:24:09.448,00:24:15.754
um for higher frequency noise.
So instances where the levels
are um above those in maximum

00:24:15.754,00:24:20.459
guidelines are in bold. So you
can see the smart speaker at 17
kilohertz and the headphones at

00:24:20.459,00:24:26.031
17 kilohertz um both exceeded
those maximum guidelines. And
then the parametric speaker did

00:24:26.031,00:24:31.070
the same for 17 kilohertz, for
21 kilohertz and for 40
kilohertz as well. Now uh what

00:24:31.070,00:24:36.408
we’re comparing to here is a
mean average of that big list of
uh guidelines I showed you

00:24:36.408,00:24:41.880
earlier. Um that was in the
paper by Timothy Leighton. So
you can see things like the

00:24:41.880,00:24:45.918
laptop and the phone are not
capable of producing sound
exceeding those maximum

00:24:45.918,00:24:50.923
guidelines so it’s a minority of
devices um in a minority of
frequencies that are capable of

00:24:50.923,00:24:56.362
doing this. With low frequency
noise uh similar story. So again
a minority of devices. Here it

00:24:56.362,00:25:00.899
was the bluetooth speaker at two
of those frequencies, a smart
speaker at all three and the

00:25:00.899,00:25:07.039
headphones at 100 hertz. Now um,
particularly when you get to
kind of the upper range of um

00:25:07.039,00:25:11.076
the, this, this kind of low
frequency noise, this might be
more audible um and will

00:25:11.076,00:25:15.414
therefore be less suitable as
kind of a covert attack. Um and
I’ll speak a bit about aud,

00:25:15.414,00:25:21.286
audability uh in a minute. Some
other results of interest, so
the vibration speaker uh is no

00:25:21.286,00:25:24.356
good for low frequency because
it vibrates so much that it
falls over. Um so everytime we

00:25:24.356,00:25:26.358
opened the, the chamber door the
speaker was lying on the floor.
Um the smart speaker, uh when we

00:25:26.358,00:25:28.360
opened the chamber it was a
really strong smell of burning
plastic. Um and when we kind of

00:25:28.360,00:25:30.362
uh tested this um we found that
it was actually permanently
damaged. So this is kind of what

00:25:30.362,00:25:35.367
happened in the 10 minutes um
that this smart speaker was
being tested. You could see the

00:25:44.510,00:25:49.415
damage starts to occur in like
the second minute this was at uh
17 kilohertz. After five minutes

00:25:49.415,00:25:53.485
of some sort of critical event
where a component burns out. And
then immediately there the

00:25:53.485,00:25:58.157
decibel level drops uh and never
recovers. And what we had
actually found was that we had

00:25:58.157,00:26:03.829
permanently damaged the speaker.
Um and we had made it unable to
reproduce frequencies above five

00:26:03.829,00:26:09.067
kilohertz. Um so we took
recordings of music um before we
did the test and after we did

00:26:09.067,00:26:13.639
the test and looked at the
spectrograms uh and on the top
is before the test and on the

00:26:13.639,00:26:18.944
bottom is after the test. So uh
this is a permanent effect as
well so we’ve kind of

00:26:18.944,00:26:23.048
permanently impaired that
speaker. Um I’d love to be able
to play it to you, because it’s

00:26:23.048,00:26:28.687
copyrighted I can’t.Um but it’s,
kind of sounds like someone um
singing like under water or in

00:26:28.687,00:26:33.358
kind of like a metal uh tank or
something like that. So it kind
of really makes a difference,

00:26:33.358,00:26:37.362
the audio quality. So we
reported that to the
manufacturers who were really

00:26:37.362,00:26:41.867
responsive and they told us the
um updates have been rolled out
to addressed it. To address it,

00:26:41.867,00:26:46.505
sorry. Um now looking at audible
components because this is kind
of a key thing for this attack,

00:26:46.505,00:26:51.944
um part of kind of the premise
of this as a successful attack
is relying on the fact that

00:26:51.944,00:26:56.615
users wouldn't be able to hear
it so depending on the device
you get more or less audible

00:26:56.615,00:27:00.519
components in kind of audible
ranges. If you look at
headphones for example, this big

00:27:00.519,00:27:05.657
spike to the right is the target
frequency which was 17 kilohertz
so that’s kind of an intended

00:27:05.657,00:27:10.662
effect. Um and then you can see
to the left you’ve got kind of
um uh different frequencies

00:27:10.662,00:27:16.735
there. Um which are pretty low
so if you’re wearing headphones
and this happens you might kind

00:27:16.735,00:27:19.905
of notice something, it might
kind of appear as kind of
distortion or popping or

00:27:19.905,00:27:24.510
something like that but um it
wouldn't be that noticeable.
Conversely if you look at the

00:27:24.510,00:27:30.816
parametric speaker um the
intended tone is still high but
there are um, much higher levels

00:27:30.816,00:27:34.753
of other more audible
frequencies which means this
would be kind of less suited for

00:27:34.753,00:27:40.826
some kind of stealthy attack. So
implications of this with the
headphones um, that it’s a

00:27:40.826,00:27:45.564
significant concern because
headphones are increasingly
used. Particularly like by young

00:27:45.564,00:27:49.701
people at high volumes and to
some extent they’re device
agnostic so you can kind of

00:27:49.701,00:27:54.940
plug, plug it into a laptop or a
phone or something. Um it might
be possible for an attacker to

00:27:54.940,00:27:58.977
kind of in, encr, um improve
that malware by for instance
only triggering certain

00:27:58.977,00:28:04.917
frequencies when uh headphones
are connected um so when that
kind of device registers. Um

00:28:04.917,00:28:09.321
with the parametric speaker um
it does produce a lot of audible
components but it might be

00:28:09.321,00:28:13.825
attractive to some attackers as
kind of a portable low cost
acoustic weapon. In any case the

00:28:13.825,00:28:17.829
fact that it’s using kind of
those ultrasonic courier wavs at
40 kilohertz at pretty high

00:28:17.829,00:28:24.770
levels means that it could be a
uh public health risk. With the
bluetooth and smart speakers um,

00:28:24.770,00:28:28.173
more difficult to attack. With
the bluetooth speakers you would
obviously need to kind of pair

00:28:28.173,00:28:32.611
with them um with the smart
speakers though um we could
permanently damage them with a

00:28:32.611,00:28:36.248
high frequency noise um
potentially that burning out of
components could be a fire

00:28:36.248,00:28:41.253
hazard as well um and other
models might be vulnerable. So
in terms of feasibility um the

00:28:44.590,00:28:49.194
attacks that we discovered were
viable on a minority of devices.
So out of the, the kind of 10

00:28:49.194,00:28:54.733
tests that we did you’re talking
about kind of a handful of two
to four devices. Um for this

00:28:54.733,00:28:59.805
attack to succeed you’re relying
on attackers not, oh sorry, on
victims not perceiving uh the

00:28:59.805,00:29:04.843
sound, on them being susceptible
to the adverse effects of that
sound um and for them being

00:29:04.843,00:29:08.547
exposed for long enough to that
sound for it to have an effect.
Remember that our tests were

00:29:08.547,00:29:13.752
only 10 minutes. So for example
if I kind of played a 20
kilohertz tone in this room now

00:29:13.752,00:29:16.622
uh, you know, a fairly high
level, um some of you would hear
it and, and not be affected by

00:29:16.622,00:29:23.095
it, some of you would hear it
and probably feel uncomfortable,
some of you wouldn’t hear it and

00:29:23.095,00:29:26.665
wouldn’t notice, some of you
wouldn’t hear it and might feel
uncomfortable. So it’s a real

00:29:26.665,00:29:33.405
kind of spectrum um so yea it’s
kind of a lot of obstacles for
an attacker to overcome for this

00:29:33.405,00:29:37.909
um for this attack to work. And
as I said some attacks require
kind of physical or local access

00:29:37.909,00:29:42.514
as well. And crucially attackers
might be interested or more
interested in other avenues. Um

00:29:42.514,00:29:48.086
so if they have kind of code
execution on a laptop for
instance or a phone, it’s likely

00:29:48.086,00:29:53.091
that there’s other stuff they’re
interested in. Um ok so moving
on to countermeasures. So uh

00:29:55.127,00:29:59.631
Deshotels in 2014 uh suggested a
number of kind of applicable
countermeasures for these kind

00:29:59.631,00:30:03.435
of attacks. The first is to
limit the frequency range of
speakers. So many speakers have

00:30:03.435,00:30:08.607
a frequency range that’s uh goes
up to kind of 20 kilohertz or
above. Um which in most cases is

00:30:08.607,00:30:13.211
not needed uh depending on what
you’re using them for. Uh
visibly alerting users when

00:30:13.211,00:30:18.850
speakers are in use by an app or
uh a software program. Doing
some kind of filtering uh during

00:30:18.850,00:30:23.488
processing to remove high or low
frequency noise if it’s not
needed. And uh with mobiles

00:30:23.488,00:30:27.492
specifically, some kind of
permissions restriction so that
if an app wants to use the

00:30:27.492,00:30:33.398
speaker you have to kind of
explicitly grant it permission
to do so. On the heuristic side

00:30:33.398,00:30:38.036
um it’s very rare that an
application, a legitimate
application, will need access to

00:30:38.036,00:30:41.540
volume levels. We kind of
thought of uh a few examples so
one would be like a muting app

00:30:41.540,00:30:46.078
for instance. And there are some
legitimate uses potentially for
ultrasounds so Google Nearby

00:30:46.078,00:30:51.283
Messages uses um ultrasound in
addition to some other commerce
channels. Um but generally

00:30:51.283,00:30:57.489
speaking um there’s kind of not
many legitimate use cases for
that. You can monitor the

00:30:57.489,00:31:01.693
environment for high or low
frequency noise. Um so most
consumer sound level meters will

00:31:01.693,00:31:06.932
not go as high or low um as the
levels we tested and you do need
specialist equipment. That being

00:31:06.932,00:31:10.702
said, there are a couple of
android apps that we used in our
pilot study. A ultrasound

00:31:10.702,00:31:15.474
detector and infrasound detector
which we used with the, a pretty
cheap, external microphone for

00:31:15.474,00:31:20.779
the android. Um and there is
some studies that suggest um
that one of the smartphones

00:31:20.779,00:31:25.584
might be ok for occupational
noise measurement at least um as
long as you kind of accept that

00:31:25.584,00:31:29.187
there are caveats with that and
limitations and that you won't
necessarily get a, a, 100

00:31:29.187,00:31:34.760
percent accurate result. Uh we
developed a proof of concept uh
Windows program um that listens

00:31:34.760,00:31:41.199
to sound uh coming in from your
laptop microphone and pops up an
alert if it hears frequencies uh

00:31:41.199,00:31:45.470
above a certain level and above
a certain amplitude. Um it’s
adapted from another open source

00:31:45.470,00:31:51.576
application. Um we are gonna
kind of release this on GitHub
in uh either this evening or

00:31:51.576,00:31:55.814
tomorrow morning but obviously
don’t use it to evaluate if
there’s actual risk of uh damage

00:31:55.814,00:31:59.151
or adverse effects to you um or
for safety compliance
assessments. If that’s something

00:31:59.151,00:32:02.420
you want to do then you should
really be speaking to a trained
professional who’s got the right

00:32:02.420,00:32:08.493
equipment. Um but the uh
application will be available
there. It does, it’s accuracy

00:32:08.493,00:32:12.164
and its kind of performance does
depend a lot on the uh
microphone you’re using and the

00:32:12.164,00:32:15.801
sound quality you’re using and
that kind of stuff. Um but if
you wanna have a play with it

00:32:15.801,00:32:21.039
and kind of see how it works
then uh please do. At the um at
the policy level um it’s really

00:32:21.039,00:32:27.145
important that, uh I think, that
these guidelines are reviewed um
and that there’s some kind of

00:32:27.145,00:32:31.850
standardization um put in place
for these. Um because as noted
before they’re often inadequate

00:32:31.850,00:32:36.188
due to their methodology. The
fact that they underestimate
certain frequencies because of

00:32:36.188,00:32:40.826
the weighting that’s been used.
Um, the fact that they uh
predominantly around

00:32:40.826,00:32:46.331
occupational context, and that
the samples are very small and
based on adult men, um and in no

00:32:46.331,00:32:51.603
way kind of um give you any kind
of uh indication if you’re
somewhere outside of an

00:32:51.603,00:32:56.775
occupational context as to what
sounds are kind of tolerable for
health. Um depending on what

00:32:56.775,00:33:00.445
area of the country you’re in,
sorry, depending on what area of
the world you’re in um you might

00:33:00.445,00:33:06.017
have legislation that pertains
to uh sound exposure um whether
it’s low frequency, high

00:33:06.017,00:33:11.356
frequency or just in general. Um
and ideally your employers would
um as uh a result of that

00:33:11.356,00:33:16.361
conduct regular checks. So uh to
sum up then. Um this was a first
stage bit of research uh on a

00:33:20.432,00:33:25.103
very small scale. We looked over
a limited number of devices, we
looked at very short exposure

00:33:25.103,00:33:30.742
times of 10 minutes um without
human experimentation. There’s
also the note that, like the

00:33:30.742,00:33:35.213
smart speaker, uh if a device is
forced to continually play high
or low frequency noise then it

00:33:35.213,00:33:40.151
may burn out anyway um but it
may take kind of several days
for that to happen. Um so we

00:33:40.151,00:33:44.422
also didn’t do any human
experimentation on uh
perceptibility as to whether uh

00:33:44.422,00:33:47.993
humans would be, actually be
able to hear this sound. And
that's just a kind of limitation

00:33:47.993,00:33:53.865
reassociation in the field
generally. Um because of kind of
ethical concerns. So more

00:33:53.865,00:33:59.271
research is definitely needed on
uh the risk of high frequency
and low frequency noise. Um that

00:33:59.271,00:34:04.943
can include like a wider range
of equipment. Um so in addition
to testing um the devices that

00:34:04.943,00:34:08.413
we tested you could look at
things like IP phones for
example and it wouldn't

00:34:08.413,00:34:13.451
necessarily have to be an attack
against them it might just be
kind of injecting uh tones into

00:34:13.451,00:34:19.024
a conversation um you could look
at kind of uh attacks on a
larger scale. Whether that’s

00:34:19.024,00:34:25.096
something like uh a kind of uh
worm attack against, you know,
50 laptops in a, in a sound

00:34:25.096,00:34:28.934
proofed environment. Whether
it’s looking at kind of big
devices like um public address

00:34:28.934,00:34:32.871
systems um or on a big scale
though logistically obviously
that would come with some

00:34:32.871,00:34:37.208
challenges. Um testing it’s
overheating effects on the
devices would be really cool to

00:34:37.208,00:34:41.913
see if that um that’s something
that’s common across a lot of
speakers. Um some more work on

00:34:41.913,00:34:46.284
countermeasures so, you know,
one of the encouraging things
about this research is the uh

00:34:46.284,00:34:50.922
whilst the attacks we developed
are pretty trivial, there are a
lot of caveats around it and the

00:34:50.922,00:34:55.760
countermeasures are also
trivial. Um [stutters] in, in,
in many um cases so that’s kind

00:34:55.760,00:34:59.831
of encouraging as well.
Obviously the ethical
restrictions to make kind of

00:34:59.831,00:35:04.869
extrapolation to real world
effects pretty challenging. Um
it’s difficult to be able to say

00:35:04.869,00:35:10.041
whether or not these attacks
would actually allow you or
allow an attacker to have any

00:35:10.041,00:35:14.245
effect on people um because
there are so many variables. Um
so we’ve only really kind of

00:35:14.245,00:35:18.450
scratched the surface in terms
of what can be done in this
field. Um so definitely if

00:35:18.450,00:35:21.553
you’re kind of interested in
this field, you want to kind of
chat about it a bit more then,

00:35:21.553,00:35:28.360
then get in touch with me. So
just a somewhat, um so it’s
likely that um attackers might

00:35:28.360,00:35:33.298
become increasingly interested
in leveraging vulnerabilities
against humans um and kind of

00:35:33.298,00:35:38.203
having digital physical effects.
Certainly the attack surface for
these devices is likely to grow

00:35:38.203,00:35:43.341
and potentially any device with
a speaker um obviously depending
on, on kind of it’s sound card

00:35:43.341,00:35:48.113
and, and um complexity could be
used for this kind of attack. Um
[speaker clears throat] and

00:35:48.113,00:35:52.884
crucially the lack of consensus
from kind of adequate safety
guidelines is a real challenge.

00:35:52.884,00:35:57.122
However, as I said, kind of
countermeasures are available.
They will work um and the real

00:35:57.122,00:36:02.227
world consequences of this is
attack is something that is yet
to be uh ascertained. So um

00:36:02.227,00:36:07.999
thank you very much. Um if you
wanna get in touch with me
that’s my Twitter handle and my

00:36:07.999,00:36:14.072
email address. Um I’m gonna take
questions uh at the far end of
the hall, uh of the hallway. Um

00:36:14.072,00:36:19.711
if you’re interested in any of
this stuff there is uh an
exhaustive list of references at

00:36:19.711,00:36:23.014
the end of this slide um at the
end of this slide deck um which
cover kind of acoustic weapons,

00:36:23.014,00:36:27.886
ultrasound, infrasound, human
effects of those um and various
other bits and pieces as well.

00:36:27.886,00:36:33.024
Um I can play with more
references if you’re interested
um but there you go, so some

00:36:33.024,00:36:36.761
more reading for you. So um
thank you very much for
listening um and as I said I’ll

00:36:36.761,00:36:41.766
take questions out in the back.
And thank you very much.
