00:00:00.067,00:00:05.072
>>Our next speaker is Bill
Swearingen. Bill Searingen is a
hacker from Kansas City.

00:00:09.209,00:00:14.348
[yelling] [applause] Bill has
been coming to DefCon for a long
time. He is a veteran of the

00:00:14.348,00:00:21.321
Alexis Park and all these new
people. [applause] Um, but just
because he’s been coming here,

00:00:21.321,00:00:26.827
he hasn’t ever spoken be- spoken
before. But believe it or not, a
lot of you may have felt the

00:00:26.827,00:00:31.999
influence of Bill Swearingen
before. For example, if you
drive past a construction

00:00:31.999,00:00:38.739
information sign and you think
every single time that should
say Zombies ahead and I know how

00:00:38.739,00:00:43.744
to do that. That’s this guy.
[applause] If you live in a
non-major metropolitan area and

00:00:50.550,00:00:55.555
you have a hacker space or have
been to a hacker space that is
in part this guy. [applause] He

00:00:59.159,00:01:04.731
co- he helped co-found the uh
Cowtown Computer Congress in
Kansas City a few years ago.

00:01:04.731,00:01:09.670
What else? If you um have come
to a little thing that we call,
SecKC [yelling] Which is the

00:01:09.670,00:01:15.609
world’s largest and the greatest
monthly InfoSec meetup. That’s
this guy. [applause] But,

00:01:15.609,00:01:20.614
probably the the the largest
reach that this man has had. How
many people in here are either

00:01:27.187,00:01:32.192
still drunk or hungover off of
booze that somebody else paid
for. [yelling] >> These are my

00:01:34.461,00:01:39.466
friends, yeah. >> This guy is
the uh is the uh better looking
part of uh DefCon parties.

00:01:42.903,00:01:49.876
[cheering] So, this is Bill’s
first time. This is a banger of
a talk. I have seen this thing

00:01:49.876,00:01:55.082
before. You guys are in for a
real treat. Give my friend and
yours, Bill Swearinger a big

00:01:55.082,00:02:00.020
welcome to DefCon. [applause]
Good f*****g time man.
[applause] >> Hello. Yeah so uh

00:02:06.727,00:02:09.730
Juris, thanks for that great
introduction, but some- uh wha-
you actually mentioned some of

00:02:09.730,00:02:16.269
the things I want to talk about.
So this my 15th year at DefCon
in a row. And and so and last

00:02:16.269,00:02:20.607
year I decided it’s time for me
to start giving back and so
those of you that that uh have

00:02:20.607,00:02:24.144
attended and those kind of
things I I’ve you know I would
say that you do the same. Start

00:02:24.144,00:02:30.183
giving back to our uh you know
to this this community. Ok. So
who’s ready to hack some cops?

00:02:30.183,00:02:35.188
[cheering] Ok. So I’m gonna tell
you th- [audience murmuring]
That right away th- this talk is

00:02:42.462,00:02:47.868
illegal. Ok. And and it’s
illegal in all 50 states and and
so uh I am a little nervous

00:02:47.868,00:02:52.572
being in front of you and and
and it’s it’s uh not little bit
not about speaking in front of

00:02:52.572,00:02:57.711
you. Not really about the
legality of the talk. I it’s
really that I run with the SecKC

00:02:57.711,00:03:02.249
crew and they’re pretty wild.
And um um I see a lot of them
right up front here and I’m a

00:03:02.249,00:03:06.686
little bit nervous of what
they’re going to do. Um and so
as I as I’m thinking about it.

00:03:06.686,00:03:11.458
Right. [laughter] So this
morning while I was thinking ok,
how’s this gonna go? I realize

00:03:11.458,00:03:14.961
that there’s probably gonna be a
few times in this talk where
people yell, “Bill you suck!”

00:03:14.961,00:03:20.500
and >> Bill you suck! >> Right.
And so about 50 percent of those
time I expect that those might

00:03:20.500,00:03:26.606
actually be my friends. So take
that take that as it is. >> Bill
you suck! [laughter] >> I don’t

00:03:26.606,00:03:33.180
think that guy is my friend.
[laughter] Ok. But I I am
serious. So some of the things

00:03:33.180,00:03:37.784
that we’re going to talk about
today. That if used are a
federal offense. Ok. And so what

00:03:37.784,00:03:42.322
I’m here to do is just kind of
talk about it and explore it and
explain how they work. Right.

00:03:42.322,00:03:47.294
I’m gonna try and do a good job
and ex- explain what is a good
idea to do and what is a bad

00:03:47.294,00:03:52.332
idea to do. To do. But I’m gonna
leave that up to you uh for your
own interpretation. Uh, ok. And

00:03:52.332,00:03:58.672
also I I do realize that the
talk that I’m about to give is
very U.S. centric um and so when

00:03:58.672,00:04:03.777
we talk about the technologies
that are used and the laws uh
that that we will break. Um th-

00:04:03.777,00:04:07.380
there you know they’re they’re
U.S. but so for those of you
that travel a long way to get

00:04:07.380,00:04:14.054
here, uh to attend DefCon, um, I
I think that the technologies
will translate pretty well um

00:04:14.054,00:04:19.059
but do a lot of your own
research about your own laws and
and go from there. Ok. So given

00:04:22.562,00:04:28.969
the topic and the nature of this
topic um I’m not exactly sure if
I will or will not get arrested

00:04:28.969,00:04:34.307
during this talk. Um and so I I
have I have consulted with my
attorney and everything like

00:04:34.307,00:04:39.012
that and so, but I figure just
in case, it would probably be
good to go ahead and post the

00:04:39.012,00:04:42.582
slides up up right now. Um so
there they are and I wanted to
give a shout out to SecKC, let’s

00:04:42.582,00:04:47.587
hear it one more time. SecKC.
[applause] Alright um, next. If
anybody has any questions after

00:04:51.024,00:04:55.295
the talk or whatever, please see
if I am in jail and if I am,
bail me out and I’ll be happy to

00:04:55.295,00:04:59.966
answer any of those questions.
[laughter] So Vincent already
kind of talked about, I’ve been

00:04:59.966,00:05:05.405
in this space before. Um, so
about 10 years ago I owned a
website called iHacked and and

00:05:05.405,00:05:09.643
one of the things that I re-
released was a device that would
trigger uh the emergency

00:05:09.643,00:05:14.781
pre-emptive devices that would
turn street lights green. Right.
Um and it was awesome man, it

00:05:14.781,00:05:18.485
was really cool. We’d be driving
around you know just like it was
green lights all the way and you

00:05:18.485,00:05:22.789
can go as fast as you want. Um
and I got a lot of attention
about it. Um, I I got

00:05:22.789,00:05:28.061
interviewed uh by you know lot
of a lot of different media.
Wired was one of them. Um and

00:05:28.061,00:05:33.233
and I thought that was that was
pretty cool, but um, so I I
learned I’ve I’ve grown since

00:05:33.233,00:05:37.904
then. You know that was 10 years
ago um I’ve learned a few
things. First, um, you know you,

00:05:37.904,00:05:43.410
you really probably should
consider talking to the media
about committing federal

00:05:43.410,00:05:48.615
offenses. Right. Um, that that
was uh that was that was not
that didn’t actually work out

00:05:48.615,00:05:52.986
very good for me. Um and and
also it was really interesting
the the quotes that came out of

00:05:52.986,00:05:59.459
that right so, so I was giving a
very technical uh, you know
interview to to Wired um you

00:05:59.459,00:06:04.564
know and talking about 5 5 5
timers and the way that we can
interact with with the

00:06:04.564,00:06:09.569
pre-emptive devices and my quote
that I got was that I take the
highway to work. Right. Alright,

00:06:12.138,00:06:17.143
but. But more importantly right
um, don’t talk publicly about
committing felonies. Alright. So

00:06:20.413,00:06:25.418
it turns out that it is a felony
to to sell, buy or use emert, uh
so you know the preemptive

00:06:27.554,00:06:32.559
device uh punishable by up to 2
years in prison with a maximum
fine of 10k. Um, or both. Whoo.

00:06:36.463,00:06:42.569
So. Well, I’m out of jail and
fines are paid so let’s do this
again. Alright. So here’s the

00:06:42.569,00:06:47.340
thing. I I am a hacker. I’ve
always been a hacker. I’ll
always be a hacker. Um and when

00:06:47.340,00:06:51.945
I think about like what that
means to me and why and how I
ended up this way. I I really do

00:06:51.945,00:06:55.815
think it it tur- it you know it
really kind of goes to to my
dad. Right. So my dad was an

00:06:55.815,00:07:01.454
engineer. I mean he spent the
time with me as I was growing up
to to question and and try to

00:07:01.454,00:07:07.160
understand and and explain and
the way that that things work in
our world. Right. Um and and

00:07:07.160,00:07:12.132
just question how it works. So
i’ve spent my life uh you know
very curious and trying to

00:07:12.132,00:07:18.138
understand uh how do things work
and why. Right. And and and how
can I make sure that that I’m in

00:07:18.138,00:07:24.944
a position that I can influence
those devices to to make my life
better. Right. Um. So I want to

00:07:24.944,00:07:30.650
take advantage of my world in
any way possible and and I think
that as hackers this is our game

00:07:30.650,00:07:36.723
that we can win. [audience] Um.
So before I get started. Um I do
want to read an excerpt from the

00:07:36.723,00:07:41.761
hacker manifesto real quick. Um
and it it says and it just
clicked off but it says, I’ll

00:07:41.761,00:07:48.034
I’ll paraphrase here, but yes, I
I am a hacker and my crime is
that of curiosity. Uh I do not

00:07:48.034,00:07:53.506
judge people by how they look,
but what they do and what they
know. Right. And so and I think

00:07:53.506,00:07:59.145
that really is a good ethos as
hackers to have. Um and and and
I hope that our community stays

00:07:59.145,00:08:04.084
strong that way. Ok. Please. If
there are any local or federal
law enforcement in the audience.

00:08:07.620,00:08:12.926
Please raise your hand. And and
I understand that that that
might not be you probably don’t

00:08:12.926,00:08:18.231
want to do that, but I, but it’s
for a reason um so, so first, I
I’m gonna be using some audience

00:08:18.231,00:08:24.137
th- uh um participation and and
you do not want to be selected
as that audience member so, any

00:08:24.137,00:08:28.842
any local federal law
enforcement, please raise your
hand. Ok, I got a couple, how

00:08:28.842,00:08:33.179
about any under cover. Any under
cover. Uh, ok. Right. [laughter]
Yeah. So I I I can’t believe

00:08:33.179,00:08:38.184
that worked. Um, but I, but I do
believe that I just won spot the
Fed right there. Um. [laughter]

00:08:42.389,00:08:46.659
Ok. But uh really really why I
want to do that is I don’t want
to live in a society without

00:08:46.659,00:08:51.297
laws. I uh really do respect
what you do. Um your mission and
and that’s not the point of this

00:08:51.297,00:08:56.436
talk, right? Um and so I I don’t
want you to feel like targeted
or or you know anything like

00:08:56.436,00:09:00.173
that in this talk. Um it’s it’s
really about the technology and
understanding and being very

00:09:00.173,00:09:05.512
curious about how that works.
Ok. Um and I will tell you for
specifically for those that that

00:09:05.512,00:09:10.116
are in law enforcement. There’s
gonna be couple slides in here
where you get a little nervous

00:09:10.116,00:09:16.289
um and um it’s ok. Like uh uh
just the- trust trust me. We’ll
We’ll get through it together.

00:09:16.289,00:09:21.227
Um I you know, and and and
everything’s ok. Um, so what
we’re, what we’re talking about

00:09:21.227,00:09:26.232
um, i- just gets right up to
that spot um and then I stop.
So, uh, trust me on it. Ok, so

00:09:29.335,00:09:33.940
story time. Um, I’ve always also
been a speed junky. I mean if
you take a look at some of the

00:09:33.940,00:09:37.110
things that we’ve done you know
the preemptive uh traffic
lights, those kinds of things,

00:09:37.110,00:09:42.449
just always kind of been a speed
junky. Um, fast cars,
motorcycles, et cetera. Um I

00:09:42.449,00:09:46.920
love them, right? But what I
don’t enjoy is all the speeding
tickets that go along with it.

00:09:46.920,00:09:53.026
Um and so. A few months ago, I’m
sitting on the side of the road
um, with some blinking lights in

00:09:53.026,00:09:58.031
my mirror, um and I started
thinking, like, what is radar?
Like, how does this work? Um,

00:10:00.733,00:10:06.105
how how can, how can I outsmart
this? How can, how can I take
advantage of of my position to

00:10:06.105,00:10:11.344
make sure that that I’m going to
win this game? Um and an
interesting thing is uh I as I’m

00:10:11.344,00:10:15.482
sitting there, I thought about a
story my dad told me one time
and this goes back when I was

00:10:15.482,00:10:21.621
very little. Um, he told, he
told me that um that that he had
some friends that were taking a

00:10:21.621,00:10:26.626
part microwaves um and and using
the magnotron in the microwaves
to to to jam radar. Um and you

00:10:28.761,00:10:33.533
know and as a kid I I didn’t
really understood what that
meant. I didn’t understand how

00:10:33.533,00:10:37.637
that worked. I didn’t really
understand, but for some reason
that that stuck with me right.

00:10:37.637,00:10:42.909
So that that little that story
that that that my dad told me it
stuck with me and so as I’m

00:10:42.909,00:10:49.782
sitting there I I decided well,
I should probably figure that
out. Ok. So it turns out um that

00:10:49.782,00:10:54.921
that radar wor- works just by
measuring the doppler shift of
sound waves. [sound affect] So

00:10:54.921,00:11:00.827
we’ve we’ve all seen that
before, right? We we’ve heard
that sound and and and probably

00:11:00.827,00:11:05.298
everybody here under- has a has
a very basic understanding of
how radar works right? We know

00:11:05.298,00:11:10.703
we know that a signal is sent.
Um it is reflected and it comes
back to you know to the sending

00:11:10.703,00:11:13.907
device and it and it measures
our our speed, right? Um and and
what what’s really interesting

00:11:13.907,00:11:15.909
is when you start looking at at
how? Like how does this work?
It’s actually very basic. Right,

00:11:15.909,00:11:17.911
so when you take a look at at
the doppler shift um, and the
way that that we measure that,

00:11:17.911,00:11:19.913
um what we can see is the police
use high frequency radio waves
and and they’re actually

00:11:19.913,00:11:25.385
microwaves ac- actually to to
bounce off objects and then they
measure the shift using this

00:11:25.385,00:11:30.390
equation in the in the return
frequency to to measure the
speed. Um, now, what’s really

00:11:43.603,00:11:48.808
important and I’ll keep calling
this out during this talk. But
this is a very important point

00:11:48.808,00:11:53.813
here. Radar measures speed. Ok.
So so what does radar measure?
Come on tell me? >> Speed >>

00:11:57.450,00:12:02.188
Speed. Ok, that’s very important
and you’ll understand here in a
little bit. Um, and and so and

00:12:02.188,00:12:07.994
and here you can you can see the
equation, but basically, um you
you you can you can read the th-

00:12:07.994,00:12:13.266
they measure the the change in
frequency over the sent uh
frequency equals 2 times the

00:12:13.266,00:12:17.937
velocity of the target over C
with constant of time. Um and
now that I recog- uh you know I

00:12:17.937,00:12:22.241
do understand that now that I’ve
shown the math, we can kind of
all go home. Right, ‘cause

00:12:22.241,00:12:27.246
everyone understands what we’re
gonna do? Right. I I get that.
Ok. Um. But ok. So let’s shift

00:12:29.582,00:12:34.587
gears a little bit. Um and and
and before we start hacking,
let’s look at how police use

00:12:34.587,00:12:40.960
radar. Um and and I do want to
say I apologize for the the
quality of of this uh the- the

00:12:40.960,00:12:46.899
image here. The video here. But
a 100 percent of the police
polled uh would not let me film

00:12:46.899,00:12:51.838
them radaring people um and they
start asking a lot of questions
and so I left. I found this one

00:12:51.838,00:12:57.243
on YouTube. Ok. [laughter] Um.
But one of the, one of the
really neat things about RF

00:12:57.243,00:13:01.514
radar um is that the officer can
kind of just set it and forget
it. Just look at look at the

00:13:01.514,00:13:07.487
video. It’s just sitting there
uh it’s radaring the cars as
they go by. Um and and he and

00:13:07.487,00:13:13.026
the officer doesn’t have to do
much. Right? Also, what’s
incredibly neat about RF based

00:13:13.026,00:13:18.865
radar is they can drive while
they’re doing. Um, we’ve all
been radared by by police uh you

00:13:18.865,00:13:24.037
know passing by those kind of
things. And what’s neat is the
way that these radios work is

00:13:24.037,00:13:29.108
they’re transmitting this
frequency and they’re receiving
signals back from multiple

00:13:29.108,00:13:35.281
objects, right? Um, the the
device can determine its current
speed by the reflections that

00:13:35.281,00:13:41.988
are coming back from stationary
objects. Like trees or signs,
right or or you know other

00:13:41.988,00:13:46.726
stati- buildings, other
stationary objects. Um and then
calculate the speed of the

00:13:46.726,00:13:51.664
moving objects based off of
that. Um and some some of the
more advance radar systems that

00:13:51.664,00:13:56.936
police can use can even track
multiple targets and even show
which lane of traffic that

00:13:56.936,00:14:01.274
they’re in. Um I just think
that’s really cool. Um you know
I I think that that’s very

00:14:01.274,00:14:07.046
interesting that the way that
this technology works. Um and as
as we really start to dig in um

00:14:07.046,00:14:13.086
and and understand ok, what is
is happening um you know with
with our radar, this this slide

00:14:13.086,00:14:18.791
is also very important. So a
very tiny fraction of the
signals sent is actually

00:14:18.791,00:14:23.796
reflected back to the police
radar system. Right? The the
rest of the RF signal continues

00:14:23.796,00:14:28.801
to to go on. Um bouncing off of
trees, um can uh scattering off
oops. Scattering off the car. Um

00:14:31.771,00:14:35.475
you know but but it continues to
to to go and that’s that’s
really all I’m trying to show in

00:14:35.475,00:14:40.980
this slide. Is that, it’s just a
little tiny fraction of what is
sent that that’s returned back.

00:14:40.980,00:14:46.786
Ok. So. >> [beep beep] X Band.
[beep beep] K Band. >> Oh. I
forgot about that one. Sorry all

00:14:46.786,00:14:52.725
you guys. >> [beep beep] Ka
Band. >> Um. So police radar eh
really comes in three um major

00:14:52.725,00:14:57.630
forms. And and you guys all
probably know this. Right. So um
but this slide if I were to take

00:14:57.630,00:15:02.802
a picture of a slide, it’s be
this one. Um and you’ll
understand why, but but X X band

00:15:02.802,00:15:09.242
is was kind of the the de facto
back in the day. Right? Um so
it’s kind of like the the older

00:15:09.242,00:15:15.815
uh the the older radar systems
that that really aren’t used
much um in in today’s um next is

00:15:15.815,00:15:20.820
K Band. Um and believe it or not
K Band is is used worldwide and
it but it is the most commonly

00:15:24.157,00:15:29.729
used radar in the United States.
Um so it if you were to rake,
you know if you were to take uh

00:15:29.729,00:15:36.202
a poll, K band still reminds the
default radar system. Um it’s
also classified as the grocery

00:15:36.202,00:15:41.641
store band um because those are
it’s the same frequency that the
the doors um at at grocery

00:15:41.641,00:15:46.712
stores use and so if any of you
guys have radar detectors using
false alerts it was likely K. Um

00:15:46.712,00:15:51.717
Ka is is the new um the the the
new multi mode version of K. Um
it’s the it’s the emerging

00:15:55.121,00:16:01.494
system. Um and um I mean it’s
it’s definitely in use uh
around. Now just uh, there’s

00:16:01.494,00:16:07.700
also the Ku band. Do I have any
Ku? Any people from KU? [crowd
boos] Alright, so so KU band

00:16:07.700,00:16:13.806
exists but no one paid a ticket
for that. So. [crowd boos]
Right. Uh yeah. Um actually Ku

00:16:13.806,00:16:20.279
band is is uh is the European Ka
so uh for anyone in Europe I
have the I have the sign- or the

00:16:20.279,00:16:27.053
frequencies there. Ok. So does
everybody at least have a basic
understanding of what radar is?

00:16:27.053,00:16:32.058
Ok. Um anybody remember what
does radar measure? >> Speed. >>
Ok, thank you, that’s very

00:16:35.161,00:16:39.298
important. I really only wanted
to to make sure that that point
was driven home. Ok, so it’s

00:16:39.298,00:16:45.705
time for a live demo. Ok. Um,
what should we not do at DefCon?
Live demos. Buty we’re gonna

00:16:45.705,00:16:51.711
give it a shot. Ok, so I do want
to take a volunteer up on the
audience. And as I was looking

00:16:51.711,00:16:58.251
across one persons kind of
sticking out. Um I have, sir?
Would you please join me? On

00:16:58.251,00:17:03.189
stage. [applause] Oh my God. >>
Police officer. >> That’s the
other half of DefCon parties

00:17:13.266,00:17:19.639
right there. [cheering] Ok. So
what we’re going to do, um the
demo that we’re gonna show is

00:17:19.639,00:17:26.412
that I’m going to uh give our
Mr. Police Officer here a radar
gun. Um I’m going to walk

00:17:26.412,00:17:32.151
towards him and I am going to
return the same frequency that
he is sending to me which should

00:17:32.151,00:17:39.058
indicate that I am standing
still. Ok? Then I am going to
slightly adjust the frequency

00:17:39.058,00:17:45.064
sending uh and I will stand
still and I will indicate that I
am moving. Um and and I realize

00:17:45.064,00:17:50.169
that I don’t have any good way
of of demonstrating this to
prove to you uh that this is

00:17:50.169,00:17:54.206
happening. So you’re just going
to have to trust me that this
wasn’t all lies, ok? That, good

00:17:54.206,00:17:59.211
there? So what you’re going to
do is you just head head over
there and point it at me and

00:18:07.186,00:18:12.191
hold down the radar gun. Ok. So
I’ve two different version so
radar guns here. One just

00:18:14.961,00:18:19.966
commonly off the shelf, um,
radar system and a hot wheels
one. Um, the the turns out the

00:18:21.968,00:18:26.973
hot wheels one was a little bit
easier to modify for my needs.
Um oh and if there are any

00:18:26.973,00:18:33.379
people from the FCC here, um, I
I’ve got you know I I do wanna
tell you that um, that uh, it

00:18:33.379,00:18:38.384
it’s all good. I stayed within
the legal limits. [laughter] Ok.
Well. Ok. So the first demo is

00:18:44.056,00:18:48.494
going to be you holding down the
button radaring me. I’m going to
return the same frequency to

00:18:48.494,00:18:54.300
you, um and and hopefully if all
goes well, you will not get a
reading. Here we go. Ok you

00:18:54.300,00:18:59.305
ready? [applause] We believe
you! Ok, now on the second the
the second demo, what I’m going

00:19:07.346,00:19:12.318
to do is I’m going to slightly
adjust the frequency of this
gun. And what what I’m doing is

00:19:12.318,00:19:16.689
now using the the doppler shift
because I know the exact
frequency that that gun

00:19:16.689,00:19:21.694
transmit. I am going to return
the signal that says I’m going a
certain speed. So don’t radar me

00:19:30.302,00:19:35.307
yet. So 111 miles an hour.
[applause] Yeah. Sorry. But
alright you want to do one of

00:19:44.417,00:19:49.422
those? >> Yeah sure. >> Alright
it is 5 ‘o clock somewhere,
right? [cheering/applause] Ok.

00:20:02.601,00:20:07.606
This is where it gets good. Oh
man that was good. Ok. So can we
do this same thing to police

00:20:12.344,00:20:17.049
radar? Yep. We could build a
device um that that says and
transmits that we are always

00:20:17.049,00:20:19.051
going 65 miles an hour. Ok? Um,
since we know uh the vehicle
speed that we want to go, um, we

00:20:19.051,00:20:21.053
just have to solve the equation
for uh two other variables
right? And that would be the

00:20:21.053,00:20:23.055
frequency that uh that that’s
sending to us um and uh a- and
we- well I guess that’s it. I

00:20:23.055,00:20:26.225
only have to solve for one. And
and the change uh the change of
frequency from there, but using

00:20:26.225,00:20:32.031
the using the math. Um and so
turns out that if I needed to to
uh to defeat X band radar, and

00:20:32.031,00:20:37.903
say that I’m going 65 miles an
hour, all I have to do is
transmit at 10 point 5

00:20:37.903,00:20:42.408
gigahertz. I don’t have to do
any kind of special encoding. Uh
there’s no packets. It is truly

00:20:42.408,00:20:48.848
just a microwave signal at 10
point 5 gigahertz. Uh if I would
like to do the same to K band

00:20:48.848,00:20:53.819
radar, uh which once again is
the most commonly used radar in
the world. Um and the U.S. Uh

00:20:53.819,00:20:57.790
all I have to do is transmit at
24 point 1 2 gigahertz. And that
will return that I’m going 65

00:20:57.790,00:21:02.728
miles an hour. Um if I would
like to so so Ka is a little bit
different. It’s it’s a multi

00:21:10.569,00:21:15.574
mode transmission. But, uh,
believe me, uh if you were to
transmit at 33 point 8 uh you’re

00:21:33.425,00:21:38.497
go- you’re gonna get away. Ok?
And and and as I was doing the
math here, I started to think,

00:21:38.497,00:21:44.103
ok, remember my dad? You you
remember that story about the
microwave? Uh, did that work?

00:21:44.103,00:21:50.042
And it turns out it did. Um, if
we would have had our microwave
oven transmitting um, back in

00:21:50.042,00:21:54.113
the day when they were using X
band radar, it the cops would
have seen that I was going

00:21:54.113,00:21:59.118
negative 97 million miles an
hour. [laughter] [applause] Ok.
Raise your hand if you know

00:22:07.693,00:22:12.698
where this is going. Yeah.
Alright. Well, here we go. So eh
uh, the interesting thing though

00:22:17.303,00:22:22.141
is is so let’s take that 65 mile
an hour example, we we have a
little bit of a problem with

00:22:22.141,00:22:27.780
that. Right? Uh so if I was
always transmitting 65 miles an
hour or if I was always

00:22:27.780,00:22:32.484
transmitting at at a certain
frequency, I’ve already shown
you that that some of those

00:22:32.484,00:22:37.489
freql- they’re they’re ranges,
right? Um and and the
calculation matters. Um, but but

00:22:37.489,00:22:42.561
really the the biggest problem
is, is if I was always going 65
miles an hour, what happens when

00:22:42.561,00:22:47.566
I go through a school zone?
Right, um and and we don’t
actually know what frequency,

00:22:50.102,00:22:55.107
the the police radar is sending.
Well friends, I got to tell ya,
we live in interesting times.

00:22:58.677,00:23:04.550
[laughter] So we live in the
future. Right. Uh the world’s
information is at our hands

00:23:04.550,00:23:11.423
right now. Right. Um and we can
do with it as we please. Um and
the newer radar detectors, uh

00:23:11.423,00:23:18.397
specifically the Valentine 1 and
the Escort 360 detect the radar
signals about 2 to 3 miles ahead

00:23:18.397,00:23:23.402
and via Bluetooth can share
exactly which frequency we’re
being radared with. [cheering]

00:23:25.504,00:23:32.011
Do you understand? [applause]
Ok. So real quick I do want to
give a shout out to Tri Wolf.

00:23:32.011,00:23:36.649
Thank you so much for, where you
at? There she is. For finding,
she was able to find me a very

00:23:36.649,00:23:41.654
consistent location to to to uh
run some tests. Would be a good
way. [laughter] Testing. Yeah.

00:23:44.323,00:23:49.328
Perfectly legal. Official
business. Ok. Oop. I went one
too far. Ok. So all we need to

00:23:54.199,00:23:58.570
do is we would just need to
build an app that knew exactly
what the current speed was of

00:23:58.570,00:24:04.810
the current speed limit, using
this this uh, roads API. Uh a
way to detect what frequency

00:24:04.810,00:24:10.282
that we’re going to be radared
in about 2 miles uh the current
generation of radar detectors do

00:24:10.282,00:24:16.689
this um and then, uh, ca-
calculate the frequency of the
speed that wish to go based upon

00:24:16.689,00:24:22.328
the current speed limit and
transmit. Right? Um, all we need
a very very small processor to

00:24:22.328,00:24:27.333
do this. Um, you know up here I
I’m showing an ESP 82 66, we
don’t need much to do that. Um,

00:24:29.735,00:24:35.841
the uh one the one of the issues
that currently that the common
commonly available SDRs uh or

00:24:35.841,00:24:39.678
Software Defined Radios that
that are available to us,
currently aren’t, aren’t working

00:24:39.678,00:24:44.850
in that high frequency or or
microwave space. Right? So so,
they- they’re they’re actually

00:24:44.850,00:24:49.088
much lower on the spectrum. But
if you take a look at the
hardware that it would take um

00:24:49.088,00:24:54.893
and and just even the way that
the SDRs progressing, um, we
could build this device very

00:24:54.893,00:25:01.333
very trivially for about 700
bucks. Ok? Uh, right now and
that and most of that most of

00:25:01.333,00:25:06.338
that cost would be around the
SDR. Right? Um and the high
frequency transmission. But, but

00:25:10.275,00:25:15.280
um, the FCC is is not gonna want
you to do that. Um, So the FCC
is very strict about radar

00:25:18.117,00:25:23.122
jammings and they’ve actually
been ill- illegal since uh 1996.
Um, that means that anyone that

00:25:25.924,00:25:27.926
uh, that that uses or sells the
devices, um, you know could,
could be a federal offense.

00:25:27.926,00:25:29.928
Right? And and and I they they
are serious about it. Um, um and
so and and not only that, like

00:25:29.928,00:25:31.930
they’re they’re so serious that
you’re not even able to like
they they are so concerned about

00:25:31.930,00:25:34.800
radar jamming, that you’re not
even able to advertise. Um,
right so it’s actually against

00:25:34.800,00:25:39.805
the law to advertises radar
jammers. Not even just use or or
or sell. Um and so and and right

00:25:57.022,00:26:02.394
now when you take a look at it a
700 dollar device, it’s really
not that cost effective anyway.

00:26:02.394,00:26:07.833
Eh eh, yet. I mean it will get
there, um and and knowing the
way that we can do this and and

00:26:07.833,00:26:11.703
when those devices become
available that’s when you can
make a a good decision. Alright.

00:26:11.703,00:26:16.708
Um, so so the FCC won’t let us
speed. Um you know or let me be
me, so le- let’s see um. What

00:26:18.877,00:26:22.948
what other effective
countermeasures uh do are
available to us? Um and and

00:26:22.948,00:26:27.953
they’re and they’re the common
things, they’re the common
things, but but if you have not

00:26:27.953,00:26:32.958
used the radar detectors, the
the the current generation radar
detectors. They’re they’re

00:26:32.958,00:26:39.598
tremendous. So earlier I I I
showed you how how the the the
um the radio frequency uh

00:26:39.598,00:26:44.837
continues to scatter. Right, it
continues to go and it continues
to bounce around on the current

00:26:44.837,00:26:50.242
generation um of radar detectors
are picking that up very good.
About 2 miles and waves is

00:26:50.242,00:26:55.614
really good. But the problem
with radar detectors, the
problem is that they suck when

00:26:55.614,00:27:00.452
it comes to to detecting laser.
Right? So, you’ve [laser sound]
Probably heard the the ra- radar

00:27:00.452,00:27:05.791
detectors today um when when you
get hit with with the laser, all
you’re going to do is that just

00:27:05.791,00:27:11.163
tells you that you’re going to
get a ticket. Right? Um, and and
and most people probably feel

00:27:11.163,00:27:15.934
like the the cops are using
laser anyway. Well, well slow
down trigger, ‘cause we got some

00:27:15.934,00:27:21.039
neat things to talk about. So,
the FCC doesn’t even regulate
the light spectrum. That’s done

00:27:21.039,00:27:26.044
by the FDA. [laughter/applause]
So so let’s hear it for light.
Come on! Light! And it also

00:27:32.784,00:27:37.656
turns that that these laser
guns, they’re very different
than their RF cousins. Um, they

00:27:37.656,00:27:43.695
they use an eye finder to single
out a specific target. Ok. Um
and if if you take a look at the

00:27:43.695,00:27:48.433
picture I have here. You’ll
notice that there there’s two
lenses, one for one that’s uh

00:27:48.433,00:27:53.305
the the transmts, that’s the
smaller lens, um and then one to
receive, that’s the larger and

00:27:53.305,00:27:58.010
that will be important here in a
second. Um, and what’s really
interesting and what what I love

00:27:58.010,00:28:03.682
about laser if the officer has
to treat it like a weapon. It
has to be, they have to be

00:28:03.682,00:28:09.955
stable. They have to point. They
have to single out a target and
they have to find a reflective

00:28:09.955,00:28:15.394
surface on your car to get a
signal back. Ok. Um, so
generally speaking, what they’re

00:28:15.394,00:28:20.499
after is they’re looking for
those, for your headlights or
your uh license plate, or those

00:28:20.499,00:28:26.371
sweet sweet fancy, blingy
grills. Um and here’s what an
officer sees when they’re

00:28:26.371,00:28:31.410
targeting your car. What you can
see in this video is you see an
officer trying to to get a lock

00:28:31.410,00:28:37.849
on a car. Um and then the second
one its a little bit harder to
see when when they do. Ok. Um,

00:28:37.849,00:28:42.854
but because laser is regulated
by the FDA, lasers have to be a
class 1 laser. That is the same,

00:28:47.159,00:28:52.164
uh, class as a laser pointer.
[laughter] Laser guns are laser
pointers. Ok. They have to be

00:28:55.867,00:29:01.440
eye safe, which means that
pretty much, you know, that the
amount of reflected laser that’s

00:29:01.440,00:29:06.445
coming back to the police
officer is very very little. Ok.
Also, um, because it’s regulated

00:29:10.248,00:29:15.988
by the FDA. They are restricted
to the the, uh, the actual
frequency of laser that they can

00:29:15.988,00:29:22.928
use. They have to use a an eye
safe laser, um, and wh- and they
they have standardized on 904

00:29:22.928,00:29:29.601
nanometers. It’s an invisible
laser beam, um, but what’s great
about this, is it’s standard.

00:29:29.601,00:29:34.606
There’s one. And it’s very weak.
And we can buy them too. Now
another thing, what does radar

00:29:40.412,00:29:45.417
measure? >> Speed. >> Well,
laser does not measure speed.
Laser measures distance. Ok.

00:29:49.454,00:29:53.859
Super important slide here. Um,
I’m going to give you guys time
to write the equation here.

00:29:53.859,00:29:58.997
[laughter] Um. Like if you eh-
you know, if we have any math
majors, you can you kind of tell

00:29:58.997,00:30:04.102
people you know explain how this
works. But is is uh, a result of
distance over time. I saw

00:30:04.102,00:30:09.107
somebody take a picture of that
slide. [laughter] Ok. Now now
the issue is that um, laser guns

00:30:14.946,00:30:19.985
uh when they when they do
measure distance, they’re doing
it at a rate that that’s a a

00:30:19.985,00:30:24.956
very aggressive. Usually around
100 to 200 measurements per
second. Um and so that really

00:30:24.956,00:30:29.628
kind of goes back to by the time
your radar detector has gone
off, um, the laser gun has

00:30:29.628,00:30:36.034
already acquired your speed. Um
and and in fact, many times
over. Right? Um and and that’s

00:30:36.034,00:30:40.906
the calculation that that the-
you know the gun is using for
distance. Um here’s where it

00:30:40.906,00:30:45.911
gets interesting. Ok, haha. Here
we go. Alright, whoo. It turns
out that in about two thirds of

00:30:48.480,00:30:53.985
our country, um, represented by
the green states that are super
cool, um, laser jamming is

00:30:53.985,00:30:59.758
perfectly legal. Um, the yellow
states are not as cool and I
just literally don’t know what

00:30:59.758,00:31:04.696
the f**k is going on in
Virginia. [laughter] So, we have
a couple options. Um this is the

00:31:10.102,00:31:14.506
one that I’m going to go with.
Um it’s not really effective,
but it’s hilarious and it makes

00:31:14.506,00:31:19.511
it very hard for the police
officer to get a lock on my car.
Ok, or or or we can detect the

00:31:22.314,00:31:27.519
gun. Let’s detect a gun.
Alright, here we go. So first we
have to know exactly how these

00:31:27.519,00:31:32.924
laser guns work. Um and before
we get started I I’m gonna show
you an example of timings. Ok?

00:31:32.924,00:31:38.096
So the timings we’re going to
talk about here will will not be
for every gun, but the frequency

00:31:38.096,00:31:43.068
that we’re using is. Um and and
what’s and what a uh one mea-
under, want you to understand is

00:31:43.068,00:31:48.573
that once you understand how
they work, you will understand
how to attack every single one.

00:31:48.573,00:31:53.612
It only comes down to a matter
of timings. Ok. So the things
that are really important here.

00:31:53.612,00:32:00.185
Um are the pulse width, how long
the laser is on, um and the
period cycle, which is, how

00:32:00.185,00:32:05.190
often it shoots. So in in this
demonstration, I show um, uh a
pulse width. 1 2 3 4 5 pulse,

00:32:07.292,00:32:13.131
pulse, pulse, pulse, pulse.
Those are pulse width. Right. Um
and the period cycle of a 5

00:32:13.131,00:32:18.136
millisecond period cycle, ok.
You’ll understand here in a
second. Ok. But this part gets

00:32:20.338,00:32:26.478
really important. Ok. So when
the when the gun sends a series
of pulses. What it’s expecting

00:32:26.478,00:32:31.483
is a return ok. And that return
measure what? Does anybody
remember? >> Booze! >> Booze.

00:32:34.486,00:32:39.491
Distance. Distance. The pulse
measures distance. Ok. So when
your car gets hit by the first

00:32:42.894,00:32:49.668
pulse, does that officer have a
lock on your speed? >> No. >>
No, they only know how far away

00:32:49.668,00:32:56.274
that car is. It’s not until the
second, third, right? You know
until they can start, that gun

00:32:56.274,00:33:01.179
can start getting a lock on
you-, on uh on your speed. Right
and so that’s why, why the, why

00:33:01.179,00:33:05.650
the um, why they they measure so
many times in in one second, a
hundred or a hundred or you know

00:33:05.650,00:33:11.590
a hundred to a hundred, two
hundred to get your speed. Ok.
So let’s go ahead and and zoom

00:33:11.590,00:33:17.462
into this pulse period and let’s
talk about some countermeasures.
Alright, so these red lines

00:33:17.462,00:33:24.002
indicate pulses from the gun.
Pulse. Pulse. Pulse. Ok
everybody good? Alright and and

00:33:24.002,00:33:29.007
it expects to get a return.
Pulse. Return. Ok. But we have a
5 millisecond window. That we

00:33:33.745,00:33:38.750
can return our own. Ok. And what
does la- laser measure? >>
Booze! >> Distance. Ok. It does

00:33:43.588,00:33:48.593
not measure speed. Right. So if
we were to return a pulse before
the reflected one, we can tell

00:33:53.331,00:33:59.537
them how far away we are.
Alright. So what I’m going to
show you is a brute forcing

00:33:59.537,00:34:04.876
method. So uh just imagine
driving around knowing exactly
which frequency you’re going to

00:34:04.876,00:34:09.881
be lasered with, it’s always the
same, 900, 904. Right? And every
1 millisecond putting a pulse.

00:34:12.150,00:34:18.423
Ok. So what um, now the
interesting thing is in in your
brain, I know where you’re

00:34:18.423,00:34:22.360
going, ‘cause I probably went
the same thing is, well, if if I
turn if I turn an immediate re-

00:34:22.360,00:34:27.399
and immediate response am I
telling the cop that I’m going
97 million miles an hour? No.

00:34:27.399,00:34:34.105
No. What I’m telling them is
that I’m very close. Right. I’m
100 feet away. But then they get

00:34:34.105,00:34:40.745
another one. He’s 100 feet away.
Then they get another one. He’s
100 feet away. I’m going 0.

00:34:40.745,00:34:46.384
Right? Um, yeah. And so, most of
the guns believe it or not, so
there there’s probably, I don’t

00:34:46.384,00:34:51.790
know, 9 or 10 different models
of of laser guns on the market,
uh, this method comes back with

00:34:51.790,00:34:57.295
an error message. Just a simple
brute force, 1 millisecond pulse
will return an error message to

00:34:57.295,00:35:02.734
the gun. Now, um, there are a
few models uh that that have
implemented countermeasures to

00:35:02.734,00:35:07.739
countermeasures um and we’ll
talk about that here in a
second. Um, so. So commercial uh

00:35:10.108,00:35:14.512
so some of the the the newer
guns that what they will do is
they will they will recognize, I

00:35:14.512,00:35:18.783
sent one pulse out and I got
four back, right? So that’s
that’s not right, so they’ll,

00:35:18.783,00:35:24.522
they’ll actually laser shift,
they like, they’ll shift their
pulse width to to account for

00:35:24.522,00:35:30.395
that to find an empty spot in in
the return the return signal.
Um, but but we can counter those

00:35:30.395,00:35:35.400
too. Right. So once we
understand how the gun laser
shifts, what it’s expected

00:35:35.400,00:35:41.806
result, we can shift our um, our
uh response to that just as
easily. Now what’s interesting

00:35:41.806,00:35:46.811
is because of of the the pulse
width and the timing, we can
identify the gun by the second

00:35:49.547,00:35:55.320
pulse. So when we get once and
then we measure how long did it,
you know, so then we move

00:35:55.320,00:36:00.925
immediately into brute force
mode. Right. Um, then we receive
another one, now we can identify

00:36:00.925,00:36:05.030
exactly which gun we’re being
targeted with and we can
implement countermeasures from

00:36:05.030,00:36:10.235
there. Um, and so I I’ll go
through those here real quickly.
Um, a countermeasure, so what

00:36:10.235,00:36:14.039
you’re seeing here on the
screen, the red lines indicate a
pulse from from the laser gun,

00:36:14.039,00:36:19.444
um the orange uh the orange
indicates our reflection and the
green is what we’re returning to

00:36:19.444,00:36:25.417
the gun. Um so what we can do is
we can vary our own returns.
Right. So imagine if we have if

00:36:25.417,00:36:30.422
we understood that we have a 5
mi-, a 5 millisecond window to
return uh that the first we we

00:36:32.791,00:36:39.197
return a very early signal,
we’re at 600 feet away. Right.
Then on that second pulse, we’ve

00:36:39.197,00:36:43.701
identified who the gun is. We
know that, we know exactly which
gun we’re being targeted with

00:36:43.701,00:36:48.640
and we can move into, we can
move into countermeasure that.
But we we then say that we’re

00:36:48.640,00:36:54.679
further away. Uh perhaps, you
kno 1,000 feet away. Now to that
gun, we’re going in reverse.

00:36:54.679,00:36:58.850
Right. And then we can continue
on wi- with the strategies like
that that that continue to to

00:36:58.850,00:37:04.456
even bypass even the most
lasered guns. Um, and commercial
laser jammers are already doing

00:37:04.456,00:37:09.194
this. There there’s a couple
there is a couple different
commercial uh products that you

00:37:09.194,00:37:12.864
you can purchase. That are
already, that are already
implementing uh these

00:37:12.864,00:37:18.136
countermeasures. Uh and so I
just wanted uh to let you know
those are available. Ok. So um,

00:37:18.136,00:37:23.141
a a few years ago I released a
uh uh tool called COTCHA. It’s
an ESP based uh wifi hacking

00:37:26.678,00:37:32.150
tool. Um and and and you know
and basically what what I’ve
done is like ok, let’s let’s

00:37:32.150,00:37:37.789
build on that platform, let’s
continue to stay with the ESP 82
66, um, it’s a build platform

00:37:37.789,00:37:44.496
that that I’m very comfortable
with, that uses the arduino, the
ard- arduino platform and we can

00:37:44.496,00:37:49.501
and we can build off of that.
Well, so what I’m going to
release here is is NOTCHACOTCHA.

00:37:53.071,00:37:58.076
So what NOTCHACOTCHA is is an
ESP 266 based, um, laser jammer.
Um it’s based on 12 volts

00:38:01.346,00:38:06.351
circuitry for easy auto-
automotive installation. Um and
um it uses on the same 9 uh 940

00:38:10.455,00:38:16.194
bru- uh should be 9 4, but it
has, it implements brute force
mode, meaning that it’s pulsing

00:38:16.194,00:38:22.801
at at a 1 millisecond pulse
rate. Um, that will bypass 80
percent of the laser jammers, um

00:38:22.801,00:38:29.574
that are in use right now. Um it
will not jam the the more ad-
advanced Dragon Eye, um systems

00:38:29.574,00:38:35.246
that that uh implement
countermeasures to brute force
mode. Um, however, um you know,

00:38:35.246,00:38:40.451
we we’re doing this open source,
right. And so, because because
commercial um, commercial

00:38:40.451,00:38:45.089
jammers exist, um, it should not
be, it shouldn’t be too
difficult for us to reverse

00:38:45.089,00:38:49.928
engineer um, the pulse cycles
that that those more um actually
I don’t know if that’s legal or

00:38:49.928,00:38:55.533
not. Um. Let’s not do that.
Let’s build our own. Ok. Um, so
um, wireless connectivity,

00:38:55.533,00:39:00.638
Android app. Um, it’s legal in
some states, right remember
those green states? Oh, I forgot

00:39:00.638,00:39:05.476
to mention, I don’t know if you
saw that, but on that that um
map, where where laser jamming

00:39:05.476,00:39:09.247
was legal, Colorado wasn’t on
there. I’m like come on,
Colorado, I thought you were

00:39:09.247,00:39:14.819
cool. Like, I just kind of…
[laughter] I don’t know. Um, it
also can la- it can uh immulate

00:39:14.819,00:39:21.226
laser guns. So you can test uh,
your your own um, you you can
test it, you can test your um,

00:39:21.226,00:39:26.231
yeah. Your radar detectors, et
cetera. Um, yea and it turns out
MIRT Mode worked ok too which

00:39:29.300,00:39:34.305
would be uh green lights, but
that’s a super bad idea. And
probably probably shouldn’t do

00:39:36.474,00:39:41.946
that. [laughter] Um, ok. Well so
I’m just gonna tell you. Like
NOTCHACOTCHA is freedom and this

00:39:41.946,00:39:47.986
this is how we can take control
of any systems that that are
targeting us. Um, we um uh hey

00:39:47.986,00:39:52.991
audio guy, gonna get louder in a
second, just FYI. Um and I just
want to say Go America, um

00:39:54.993,00:40:00.031
except for Virgina, ‘cause I
don’t know what’s going on
there. [laughter] Um. Uh so real

00:40:00.031,00:40:05.670
quick this is kind of what it
looks like. A bill of materials.
Super simple. We’re looking at a

00:40:05.670,00:40:10.675
ESP 82 66 and and an LED Array
essentially and a 12 volt
circuit. Um cost is 8 bucks.

00:40:22.120,00:40:25.690
[cheering] Um, so so code is
available now. It’s kind of
janky, but that’s how it goes at

00:40:25.690,00:40:31.596
DefCon. Um and I actually meant
to bring one, I have I have one
here, but I broke it yesterday

00:40:31.596,00:40:38.236
uh when we were pre- prepping
for the talk. Uh. >> Bill you
suck! >> I know. Bill, I know.

00:40:38.236,00:40:41.639
[laughter] Um, so seriously um
you know, so it is being
released open sourced, um the

00:40:41.639,00:40:47.211
brute force mode works. Um, I I
‘cause I test it. I live in
Kansas, it’s legal there. Um,

00:40:47.211,00:40:53.951
and um so you know it’s only
round one. I’ll continue to to
to post code um and I I would

00:40:53.951,00:40:59.590
really expect, or I would really
hope or and appreciate if
anybody would like to to help

00:40:59.590,00:41:05.163
me, build a fully open source uh
laser jammer that that competes
with with the commercial grade

00:41:05.163,00:41:10.802
eh- eh- equipment. And so that
guys thank you very much, had a
great time. Um, really

00:41:10.802,00:41:15.807
appreciate it. [music]
[applause]
