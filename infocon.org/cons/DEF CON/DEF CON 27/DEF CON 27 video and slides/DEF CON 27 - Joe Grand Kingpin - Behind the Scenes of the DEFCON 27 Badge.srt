00:00:01.034,00:00:07.741
>>Hey, so welcome to the 27th
Defcon >>woo! >>let’s hear it!
>>woo! yeah! >>come on, come on

00:00:07.741,00:00:13.780
are we that old? >>yeah, we’re
27 >>I don’t, I don’t feel old
>>we’re really old. People ask

00:00:13.780,00:00:17.518
me why I’m so young it’s just
like I suck the blood out of
young IT interns. >>yeah

00:00:17.518,00:00:22.522
hahahahahha >>I have my own
little blood boy um haha. Okay,
so what we’re gonna do is we’re

00:00:24.591,00:00:29.029
gonna talk a little bit, like we
already saw a show of hands how
many of you are new um, I just

00:00:29.029,00:00:35.903
want to reiterate a couple of
basic points. One is um, we
question everything uh and if

00:00:35.903,00:00:41.308
you hear something and or see
something you don’t understand
ask a question, that’s the whole

00:00:41.308,00:00:46.313
point of Defcon is that I want
you, us to learn, drink, meet
friends, break s***, like it’s

00:00:51.084,00:00:56.890
an experience that I didn’t
fully appreciate until
maybe-maybe 2 or 3 years ago I

00:00:56.890,00:01:01.094
was talking to a friend he’s
like well I’m not sending my
team to blackout, I’m sending

00:01:01.094,00:01:04.865
them to Defcon. I said well
that’s really interesting, why
would you- what’s the

00:01:04.865,00:01:09.770
difference? And he’s like well,
my team’s really sophisticated,
you know they’re experienced and

00:01:09.770,00:01:15.642
so I sent, I would send somebody
maybe to get specific training
on specific technology like to

00:01:15.642,00:01:20.814
get a little bit smarter like
sharpen the edge of the knife a
little bit more, but then I send

00:01:20.814,00:01:25.819
people to Defcon to learn, to
become better thinkers. I was
like woah, like I hadn’t thought

00:01:29.122,00:01:34.127
of that. [applause]. And so,
once you start realizing that’s
how other people see us is like

00:01:37.331,00:01:41.368
well that’s the place I go to
send people to learn it’s like
well okay what-what are they

00:01:41.368,00:01:46.373
learning? It’s like that sort of
crept into the theme for this
year which is unofficially you

00:01:46.373,00:01:51.945
know keep infosec out of
hacking, because I think infosec
is great at getting you jobs,

00:01:51.945,00:01:56.616
y-you gotta get paid but,
getting paid and having the
skills to get paid are different

00:01:56.616,00:02:02.122
than the joy of exploration, the
joy of discovery spontaneously
you know learning something

00:02:02.122,00:02:07.127
challenging something failing,
being okay to fail not afraid to
fail, um and to do it in a

00:02:09.596,00:02:13.433
friendly environment, um and
challenge each other. And, I
think maybe that’s the

00:02:13.433,00:02:18.005
difference, like if your jobs on
the line in infosec maybe you
are afraid to fail. >>Well it’s

00:02:18.005,00:02:22.075
also yeah like just because
you’re an infosec doesn’t
necessarily make you a hacker

00:02:22.075,00:02:25.112
and just because you’re a hacker
doesn’t necessarily mean you’re
an infosec right? Cause the

00:02:25.112,00:02:28.548
hacker world is so much more
than that and I didn’t realize,
I didn’t really think about that

00:02:28.548,00:02:33.620
either until like a few years
ago where it really is kind of
started from that same nugget

00:02:33.620,00:02:38.558
you know of people but it’s not
like that now and and Defcon has
a feeling that other places just

00:02:38.558,00:02:43.830
don’t have. >>Yeah and so we’re
really trying to embrace that so
over the last few years we were

00:02:43.830,00:02:48.068
using like well is it hacker
enough? It’s like sort of like
if you’re watching metalocalypse

00:02:48.068,00:02:54.074
it’s like ooh that’s metal it’s
like ooh is that hacker or not
hacker, could be cool but that

00:02:54.074,00:02:58.045
doesn’t necessarily mean we’ll
put it here. That-that’d go
great somewhere else. >>more

00:02:58.045,00:03:02.983
cowbell. Is it cow is it
[laughter] hacker cowbell
enough? >>Um, so two years ago

00:03:05.886,00:03:10.757
uh if you remember we tried an
experiment, we went to China for
the first time, we took Defcon

00:03:10.757,00:03:16.997
outside of the united states for
the first time ever, and it was
really an experiment to see 1)

00:03:16.997,00:03:22.002
does Defcon travel, like are our
are our beliefs or are our
skills transferable and it

00:03:24.905,00:03:30.010
turned out to be hugely popular.
Um, in the first year we were
the largest kind of security

00:03:30.010,00:03:35.749
event in China for hacking. And
I just told this funny story
which was when we were first

00:03:35.749,00:03:40.754
going to China well um, how much
money should we charge for the
conference? Like, well, nobody’s

00:03:43.256,00:03:47.694
every charged money for a
conference. It’s all like as a
marketing expense it’s all free.

00:03:47.694,00:03:53.500
Like okay, um, should we do it
on the weekend to attract
students um or maybe on the

00:03:53.500,00:03:58.839
weekday for companies you know
people like who-who’s gonna come
like hmm nobody’s ever done a

00:03:58.839,00:04:04.077
conference on the weekend
before. Like alright um now okay
t-shirts, we wanna sell

00:04:04.077,00:04:10.083
t-shirts, how much do t-shirts
normally sell for? Oh, nobody’s
ever sold t-shirts before

00:04:10.083,00:04:15.589
[laughter]. Like okay we’re just
gonna go in there and see what
happens and so we had our uh our

00:04:15.589,00:04:21.328
second uh Defcon China and at
the time I was really trying to
do something special so I-I

00:04:21.328,00:04:26.933
contacted KIngpin and I was like
kind of trying to hypnotize him
and get him to come back and

00:04:26.933,00:04:31.538
make some badges and do
something cool and Joe
you-you’re like well it has to

00:04:31.538,00:04:36.276
be something cool. >>yeah.
You’re also a hard guy to say no
to. Ha, he was very convincing.

00:04:36.276,00:04:41.448
But, it had to be something new
and cool and different because
that’s what Defcon is about.

00:04:41.448,00:04:46.186
>>Well, so, for those of you not
around back then you know when
we had the idea of a hardware

00:04:46.186,00:04:52.959
badge we went to Joe. Joe made
the first badge life badge, I
mean that was Joe. And so he’s

00:04:52.959,00:04:58.064
gotten to see his little nugget
explode and so it’s a little bit
of like well now you’re coming

00:04:58.064,00:05:01.768
back you-you don’t want to just
do the same thing over again.
>>Right, well it’s overwhelming

00:05:01.768,00:05:05.872
too, because there you know the
resources have gotten better, so
many people are creating this

00:05:05.872,00:05:10.510
amazing artwork and badge life
community and all of this stuff
so when I came back into it I

00:05:10.510,00:05:14.681
was like how, how can I even
compete with what has happened
over 9 years you know since

00:05:14.681,00:05:19.219
Defcon 18 and there was a lot of
worry at first and then I was
like well I’ll just kind of do

00:05:19.219,00:05:23.023
what I do and not try to
compete, just do my style like
I’ve always done an-and hope

00:05:23.023,00:05:27.627
people like it and I think it
worked? >>Well and y- and the
original story I-I don’t know if

00:05:27.627,00:05:33.400
this really came out but the
original story why we did that
hardware badge um back then is I

00:05:33.400,00:05:37.838
didn’t see the community at
blackhat or Defcon. I didn’t see
a lot of hardware hacking

00:05:37.838,00:05:43.176
skills. There was like Kingpin
and a couple people but it the
skills were very limited in a

00:05:43.176,00:05:47.480
few people. And I always
remember thinking that if I was
going to have to take over the

00:05:47.480,00:05:53.553
world, or overthrow the
government or whatever defend
myself against the robots, we

00:05:53.553,00:05:57.724
need more hardware hacking
skills and so this was a secret
backdoor attempt to get the

00:05:57.724,00:06:02.662
community more involved in
hardware. Ha >>and now it’s >>it
worked >>it worked yeah. It was

00:06:04.764,00:06:08.535
>>but we didn’t know right? It
was sort of like are people even
gonna -they’re gonna get this

00:06:08.535,00:06:12.672
thing and even know what to do
with it or what’s the response
gonna be but dark tangent like

00:06:12.672,00:06:17.777
he just had this- I mean you
this happens a lot like you sort
of new what where the direction

00:06:17.777,00:06:21.181
of things were going or like
what people wanted and it turned
out okay, and the conference was

00:06:21.181,00:06:25.952
much smaller then but then it’s
just sort of ramped up. >>yeah,
yeah so um so when I did attract

00:06:25.952,00:06:32.425
um Joe to come and do the badges
for China, we wanted to do
something new, and so you want

00:06:32.425,00:06:35.695
to talk just briefly about the-
>>Yeah well I might as well,
here I’ll just throw up this

00:06:35.695,00:06:39.366
slide I have of kind of the
history of stuff that I’ve done
and the China one is the lower

00:06:39.366,00:06:42.068
right um which is a flexible
circuit board and uh with some
artwork on the front sort of

00:06:42.068,00:06:46.806
representing a tree uh and the
thought there was to build
community sort of like you’re

00:06:46.806,00:06:51.811
planting a tree so you do
different tasks at Defcon and
the root leds will uh turn on

00:06:54.581,00:07:00.120
depending on what task you do
which is very similar to this
badge uh as you’ll see um and it

00:07:00.120,00:07:03.790
has a very easy development
environment so you can write
some code for it. But, it was

00:07:03.790,00:07:09.663
something to build community and
to see Defcon China especially
as this new kind of culture of

00:07:09.663,00:07:13.833
hackers uh kind of take that and
we had to explain to them what
is an electronic badge like

00:07:13.833,00:07:17.437
what’s the purpose of even doing
it. Um, was pretty amazing and
that actually some of the

00:07:17.437,00:07:22.442
response from Defcon China is
what um kind of inspired me to
make the U.S badge as it is.

00:07:24.878,00:07:28.048
>>and so uh yeah, and so it was
like you said it was flexible
and I think at the time you were

00:07:28.048,00:07:31.718
saying there’s two or there’s
only a handful of manufacturers-
>>-yeah, yeah there’s not many

00:07:31.718,00:07:35.322
and and it’s costly and usually
you see small pieces that are
you know for instance out of a

00:07:35.322,00:07:38.224
printer that’s moving back and
forth or something and we’re
like well can we do something

00:07:38.224,00:07:42.195
that’s you know paper thin, that
has electronics on it, that the
electronics aren’t gonna pop off

00:07:42.195,00:07:45.398
when you bend it uh but it’s
just something you know
something new. >>well- well-

00:07:45.398,00:07:50.904
well actually see the badge is
white, the paint alone on the
badge- >>yeah >>yeah added to

00:07:50.904,00:07:54.307
the- >>-it added it gave it a
little bit more thickness so it
wouldn’t- it wouldn’t kind of

00:07:54.307,00:07:57.777
break ground and then you know
you can see the other ones like,
they’re definitely not as

00:07:57.777,00:08:02.415
complicated as a lot of the the
badge life badges. Badge life
started the resources for even

00:08:02.415,00:08:05.485
designing circuit boards and
then even getting them
fabricated was is a whole other

00:08:05.485,00:08:09.389
story, you can always watch
those talks I think they’re on
the Defcon media server. Um, but

00:08:09.389,00:08:13.660
little by little we always tried
new techniques always tried new
fabrication techniques, new

00:08:13.660,00:08:17.664
components. >>well so, so this
bottom one was an aluminum-
>>-yeah that bottom middle one

00:08:17.664,00:08:22.769
Defcon 18 was the last one I did
before I retired and um that was
an aluminum substrate with all

00:08:22.769,00:08:27.006
the components on the backside
laser engraved on the front side
just trying crazy stuff and I

00:08:27.006,00:08:30.777
remember having a conversation
in a hotel room with you where
we had to get the boards made

00:08:30.777,00:08:34.948
and then send them out and it
was it was this like do we want
to take the risk of, of doing it

00:08:34.948,00:08:38.985
and it was like let’s just try
it and see what happens. >>yeah,
so that’s the sort of uh and

00:08:38.985,00:08:42.622
you’ve been unfortunately on the
receiving side of sometimes when
we try something and it fails-

00:08:42.622,00:08:46.626
>>-yeah- >>- like international
shipping customs or- >>ha ha
some of you might remember those

00:08:46.626,00:08:51.564
days >>-yeah badges arriving a
little bit late, pieces falling
off of them >>hahaha not my

00:08:51.564,00:08:56.770
badge >>no ha >>actually, no,
this year maybe hahahah >> so uh
yeah so on the China badge it

00:08:56.770,00:09:02.308
was like what backlit uh LEDs?
>>yeah so we had reverse mount
LEDs that were diffused through

00:09:02.308,00:09:06.780
the circuit board substrate, so
each of those little dots
actually- that picture’s a

00:09:06.780,00:09:10.750
prototype but the production one
had the substrate which is sort
of a brownish color so as the

00:09:10.750,00:09:14.554
lights lit up they’d diffuse so
you could- you wouldn’t really
see it was an LED it just looked

00:09:14.554,00:09:19.092
almost like a like an ornament
or something you know on a tree.
>>and um, I think maybe the one

00:09:19.092,00:09:24.230
thing to-to segway into this
years badge is the China badge
you would take it and physically

00:09:24.230,00:09:29.436
plug it in to a visualization
station and the visualization
station the art instillation

00:09:29.436,00:09:35.275
would then take essentially your
leaves and your roots and it
would give you a representation

00:09:35.275,00:09:40.280
on this 3D immersive space and
so you could see the community
solving problems and challenges

00:09:42.315,00:09:47.387
and watching the actual tree of
the whole con grow and I was
like man that is so cool >>yeah

00:09:47.387,00:09:52.225
that was amazing- >>yeah we
gotta try to see if we can do
something remo- >>-yeah it

00:09:52.225,00:09:54.894
started as just bare tree and
then you know later on- >>-over
the course of the con as people

00:09:54.894,00:09:59.232
accomplished more things um-
>>-and that’s- that’s always the
I mean that’s always the goal

00:09:59.232,00:10:03.336
with every with every badge with
every village- >>-so, we
socially engi- we sit around and

00:10:03.336,00:10:08.108
socially engineer like how do we
use the badge as a point for you
to meet other people? You to

00:10:08.108,00:10:14.581
interact, or you have something
that they need or on an excuse
to interact- >>right- >>and so-

00:10:14.581,00:10:17.817
>>yeah, yeah- >>that’s half the
other part is we’re trying to
figure out well is it a game are

00:10:17.817,00:10:21.154
the games like you’re infected
and you’re a zombie >>right-
>>and then there’s a doctor

00:10:21.154,00:10:24.791
>>but then-then it’s competitive
right >>it’s competitive >>we
didn’t want competitive we

00:10:24.791,00:10:28.328
wanted collaboration- >>-yeah
and so we spent a lot of time
just trying to figure out how do

00:10:28.328,00:10:31.664
you make it so that like one
person doesn’t flash the instant
killer badge >>right >>and turn

00:10:31.664,00:10:37.837
around and wipe out everybody
you know [laughter]. We have to
contemplate a little rogue actor

00:10:37.837,00:10:44.010
>>yeah >>okay, so, so a little
bit then just about Defcon this
will be our largest Defcon ever

00:10:44.010,00:10:49.015
we are in these-these 4 hotels,
um we want feedback, we know
we’re not gonna please all the

00:10:51.351,00:10:56.523
people all the time but we try
too. Uh so, if you have a
problem or you’ve got feedback,

00:10:56.523,00:11:01.227
please let us know. Um, if your
badge does fall apart or
something goes wrong there’s a

00:11:01.227,00:11:05.031
soldering skills village. Um,
you’re gonna talk about some of
the people are here- >>-yep,

00:11:05.031,00:11:08.067
some of the resources available
for if you want to try to fix
your own stuff, that’s towards

00:11:08.067,00:11:12.138
the end. >>yeah, okay so with
that I want to pass it over to
Kingpin and he’s gonna kind of

00:11:12.138,00:11:17.143
talk about this years
badge.[applause] >>Alright, man
I never thought I’d be back up

00:11:23.116,00:11:27.120
here talking about a badge. Sort
of the story that went with
that, when I stopped doing the

00:11:27.120,00:11:32.492
badges um I just kind of felt
like my role was done um and I
was kind of just competing mys-

00:11:32.492,00:11:36.162
with myself every year and sort
of doing the same thing over and
over even with different

00:11:36.162,00:11:39.933
technologies and I was like
alright well I should just step
back, let Defcon grow, let

00:11:39.933,00:11:45.572
somebody else do the, you know
do the badge and see where it
goes. Um, but I’d always said

00:11:45.572,00:11:51.511
like if DT calls me, then I’ll
do the badge again, and low and
behold he-he did. So, yeah

00:11:51.511,00:11:55.348
definitely never, never thought
I’d be up here um it-it’s an
honor to be back it’s really

00:11:55.348,00:12:00.086
great to see how Defcon has
changed and just the number of
people and the variety of people

00:12:00.086,00:12:06.326
um and to-to work at such a high
volume like I’ve always I’ve
been basically designing the

00:12:06.326,00:12:10.663
badge for this day so I can
finally talk to people about
what it is because it’s been a

00:12:10.663,00:12:15.969
secret for I don’t know 6 or 8
months or something and my wife
doesn’t want me to talk about it

00:12:15.969,00:12:20.873
anymore and nobody wants to you
know, my kids don’t want to talk
about it anymore, so finally I

00:12:20.873,00:12:27.180
can talk about it. Um, yeah so,
so really the goal um for my
type of badges I like them to be

00:12:27.180,00:12:33.486
simple, kind of unobtrusive, uh
but have some things that you
know hard core badge people can,

00:12:33.486,00:12:37.156
can work with and and
electronics people, but that’s
not the main point. The main

00:12:37.156,00:12:43.229
point of this one is to appeal
to as many possible people that
we can. Because Defcon a lot of

00:12:43.229,00:12:47.667
times you know, you don’t have
to be a hardware hacker to use
the badge for this and I-I

00:12:47.667,00:12:52.505
really want people to sort of
use it as um as you’ll see kind
of as a guide to help you

00:12:52.505,00:12:56.609
through Defcon. Um, my-my
thought about this was like
alright if this was my first

00:12:56.609,00:13:01.814
time at Defcon, there’s so much
going on, it’s so overwhelming
like what-what do I even do

00:13:01.814,00:13:06.819
where do I go? Uh, so this badge
is, is part of that um, where
the actual game play is very

00:13:10.390,00:13:14.260
simple and this is the slide
where everybody who’s been
hacking on the badge yesterday

00:13:14.260,00:13:19.265
starts crying. Um, I didn’t
build puzzles into it. The
puzzle is the badge quest. Uh,

00:13:21.968,00:13:27.306
you know, uh there’s so many
amazing puzzle badges out there
andnxor badges um just all the

00:13:27.306,00:13:31.277
badge life stuff and that’s like
I mentioned that’s I can’t even
think that way I can’t you know

00:13:31.277,00:13:35.448
come up with a puzzle. My, my
stuff is all about just like
trying to keep it simple, single

00:13:35.448,00:13:41.087
task to like appeal to lots of
people. So, when you power up
your badge you might notice that

00:13:41.087,00:13:46.025
the lights kind of blink in a
slow pattern, that’s what I call
the attract mode, and that’s

00:13:46.025,00:13:51.030
just the the pre state. Um, and
then there’s a bunch of
different states that you have

00:13:51.030,00:13:57.303
to go through uh to achieve the
final, the final state. Um, I’m
not gonna give away too much, I

00:13:57.303,00:14:00.606
know people have done some
reverse engineering but there,
there a number of ques- a number

00:14:00.606,00:14:06.279
of tasks you have to complete uh
around the conference and it
basically, the badge is to get

00:14:06.279,00:14:12.819
you to experience Defcon. So, um
I- I think somewhere later on
I’ll I’ll mention the tasks, but

00:14:12.819,00:14:17.423
it’s not something that you can
just go run around and like you
know auto- automatically win, uh

00:14:17.423,00:14:21.260
unless you hack it. But, it
really is to get you to try new
things and sort of experience

00:14:21.260,00:14:25.131
things cause like even I haven’t
done everything at Defcon. It’s
impossible to do everything but

00:14:25.131,00:14:29.502
at least if you can try to do
the different tasks uh you know
you, you meet new people, you

00:14:29.502,00:14:33.573
learn new things and and it’s
just kind of fun. So,
there-there are some hackable

00:14:33.573,00:14:38.644
aspects to it but it really is
more to encourage people to get
out there and to kind of

00:14:38.644,00:14:43.416
celebrate that and again build
community and have it be
something simple that can relate

00:14:43.416,00:14:47.920
to people uh and then still have
a few things that are you know
hidden for, for other people.

00:14:50.423,00:14:53.626
So, here’s what the hardware
looks like, I will get into the
details of that but I wanted to

00:14:53.626,00:14:59.232
at least kind of clarify the
main functionality. Um, this is
what the hardware looks like and

00:14:59.232,00:15:05.438
uh there’s kind of a few main
subsystems, the-the probably the
coolest thing is the um you see

00:15:05.438,00:15:10.209
antenna, upper left, NFMI on the
bottom we call that infamy
because I can’t actually say

00:15:10.209,00:15:15.214
NFMI very fast, uh, it’s like
one acronym tongue twister. Uh,
so that infamy chip is near

00:15:17.250,00:15:21.287
field magnetic induction and
it’s actually a communication
mechanism that uses magnetic

00:15:21.287,00:15:26.993
induction uh instead of like
traditional RF, where you’re
propagating RF. So, I’ll talk a

00:15:26.993,00:15:30.229
little bit more about it later
but what I wanted to mention is,
I’ve seen a lot of people sort

00:15:30.229,00:15:34.600
of kiss their badges together
like magnets and their is some
similarity because a magnet has

00:15:34.600,00:15:38.237
a magnetic field and this badge
is generating a magnetic field
but you don’t have to touch them

00:15:38.237,00:15:42.809
together you can be maybe up to
a foot, maybe a little bit more
and the data is still gonna

00:15:42.809,00:15:48.147
communicate. Uh, but it doesn’t
leave an RF signature so all of
you, you know RF soccer friend

00:15:48.147,00:15:51.918
radio badge hackers trying to
hack on the communication,
you’re not going to be able to

00:15:51.918,00:15:55.021
do it unless you have some
magnetic probe and you’re
standing you know right between

00:15:55.021,00:15:59.225
me and Jeff or something like
that. It’s very short range
which means that one of the

00:15:59.225,00:16:02.662
possibilities outside of Defcon
is you can make some sort of
covert communication you know

00:16:02.662,00:16:07.200
message passing thing uh you
know instead of passing papers
in class you can you know walk

00:16:07.200,00:16:11.237
by your friend with a with a
badge or something. But it’s
cool I think it has some cool

00:16:11.237,00:16:16.175
covert subversive uses which
actually ties back into that
theme of uh you know using

00:16:16.175,00:16:21.080
technology in a way that-that
helps us and not just harvest
all of our information and all

00:16:21.080,00:16:27.987
of our data get sold to
everybody which is super
frustrating. Um, we have uh the

00:16:27.987,00:16:31.524
microcontroller, LED driver,
Piezo but it-it I tried to keep
the design really simple and it

00:16:31.524,00:16:37.430
actually wasn’t simple,but in
appearance, I thought it was
somewhat simple. Um, I also want

00:16:37.430,00:16:42.235
to mention this, the mounting
options this is something that
you know like like DT said, we

00:16:42.235,00:16:46.472
like to try doing new things
with the badge, it’s great to
say that and it’s easy to say

00:16:46.472,00:16:52.345
let’s try something new and see
what happens but you still want
to plan and hope it works.

00:16:52.345,00:16:55.715
Because, if we tried something
new and it completely failed
like that would, that would

00:16:55.715,00:16:59.919
suck. Um, so we want to try this
new mounting method because
normally you know you have your

00:16:59.919,00:17:03.823
lanyard, you clip your badge
onto the lanyard. But, what we
thought was what if we move up

00:17:03.823,00:17:09.862
the stack and bring our badge up
onto the lanyard so now we free
up the actual lanyard clip for

00:17:09.862,00:17:13.866
badge life stuff because there’s
so many other blinky badges out
there, instead of crowding

00:17:13.866,00:17:17.603
everything like you have some
space. It’s like the uh what is
it like the bolo tie? Here I’m

00:17:17.603,00:17:22.608
gonna try this. You can like you
know bring it up and be like
check it out my badge man hahaha

00:17:25.711,00:17:29.548
[applause] so, and it’s like you
who knows what people are going
to do with it right? And that

00:17:29.548,00:17:31.550
was so actually I’m gonna leave
it this way, um hold on, I just
don’t want to strangle myself.

00:17:31.550,00:17:36.556
But, that was sort of the intent
like let’s give something new
and see what people do with it.

00:17:40.559,00:17:45.231
And what’s funny is most people
just clipped it onto the clipped
it onto here. And it was like

00:17:45.231,00:17:49.201
no,that’s not what we wanted so
we tweeted out like you know
here use your lanyard straps you

00:17:49.201,00:17:54.006
can mount them in different
things. Um, so I would recommend
besides the normal mounting

00:17:54.006,00:17:58.811
method like this which you slide
the lanyards the lanyard through
what I call the lanyard straps

00:17:58.811,00:18:03.749
which are actually high current
jumper um bars, bus bars, um,
you can do other creative stuff.

00:18:06.519,00:18:11.557
So, we actually made watch bands
this year so if you go to the
swag area, I think they’re 5

00:18:11.557,00:18:16.662
bucks or something like that and
you can wear your badge like a
watch. Or, I saw somebody who

00:18:16.662,00:18:21.267
made a like a neck I don’t know
what they’re called neck jewelry
around their neck and like

00:18:21.267,00:18:24.870
that’s cool or maybe as a pin or
you wear it on your head, I
wanted to make a headband but I

00:18:24.870,00:18:28.975
don’t know how to do that. Um,
you know just something
different right because that’s

00:18:28.975,00:18:33.613
sort of like the physical,
changing the physical aspect to
see what happens. And uh, I

00:18:33.613,00:18:37.750
thought that was sort of fun
because this is really like a
piece of jewelry as well as the

00:18:37.750,00:18:41.153
badge and some people might not
want to go and figure out the
electronics, you just want to

00:18:41.153,00:18:46.158
show it off and like that’s kind
of cool. So, here’s the block
diagram for the system um I’m

00:18:49.562,00:18:53.432
not going to go super into
details yet because I want to
tell the story of how we even

00:18:53.432,00:18:58.904
figured why we’re doing all of
this stuff in the first place.
Uh, but we have a uh NXP ARM

00:18:58.904,00:19:04.343
cortex M0 as the microcontroller
which is the KL27, that’s a
general purpose microcontroller

00:19:04.343,00:19:09.415
but really powerful as far as
letting us reconfigure pins to
be different functions and that

00:19:09.415,00:19:13.686
helped a lot when we were doing
our layout. Um, this information
by the way, these slides or a

00:19:13.686,00:19:17.690
slightly earlier version of
these slides and some of the
badge design details are on the

00:19:17.690,00:19:22.161
Defcon media server already. Uh,
some of the firmware is there as
well if you want to look through

00:19:22.161,00:19:27.099
that. I will post on my website
the final actually an expanded
version of these slides um plus

00:19:27.099,00:19:32.104
some other details whenever I
can actually get to my room and
do it. Um, so we have the LED

00:19:34.273,00:19:38.978
driver, we have the NFMI radio
which is also an NXP chip and
I-I’ll get into the details of

00:19:38.978,00:19:42.915
those uh but I ha- you know had
to have some blinky lights on
there because every badge should

00:19:42.915,00:19:46.619
at least blink maybe a little
bit. So, we put some lights on
there as sort of some indicators

00:19:46.619,00:19:51.357
and then we have some two uh low
dropout linear regulators that
takes a 3.3 volt battery and

00:19:51.357,00:19:55.394
then drops it down even more.
Um, that’s one of the things I
really like is trying to, trying

00:19:55.394,00:19:58.697
to get electronics working with
a single coin cell that’s sort
of light weight, there was two

00:19:58.697,00:20:03.502
years of my badges that one time
we had to add an extra coin cell
at the last minute uh because I

00:20:03.502,00:20:09.709
didn’t read the manual properly
and uh one year we used like a
CR123a but having these small

00:20:09.709,00:20:14.713
ones makes it I think just a
little, little more comfortable.
Oh, I do have the details here.

00:20:16.882,00:20:22.688
Okay, so microcontroller um this
really is just th-the heart of
the system so this controls

00:20:22.688,00:20:29.228
communicating to the LED driver,
to the radio, um, processing the
g- the badge quests and uh it’s

00:20:29.228,00:20:34.967
just something that you need in
every system um, it is an NXP
chip. But, the coolest thing

00:20:34.967,00:20:40.139
again is the NFMI chip and this
is something where typically you
see this, this technology has

00:20:40.139,00:20:45.277
been around for a long time but
you only really see it in super
high volume products. When I

00:20:45.277,00:20:51.083
first, yeah like at least a
million volume um or most
companies won't even acknowledge

00:20:51.083,00:20:55.020
that you exist. And, that’s a
problem when you’re a hacker or
when you’re a small company or a

00:20:55.020,00:21:01.093
small engineer trying to work on
something. Um, but the way we
found out about this is uh I had

00:21:01.093,00:21:04.330
previously worked with free
scale on some of the earlier
badges and they had a great team

00:21:04.330,00:21:08.701
of people that would sort of you
know help us out and show us
what’s going on. Um, NXP ended

00:21:08.701,00:21:13.739
up purchasing them and one of
our, one of our contacts still
works for NXP and I called him

00:21:13.739,00:21:18.677
and said hey, I’m doing the
Defcon badge again, he’s like
what? Hahaha you are? And uh, he

00:21:18.677,00:21:22.181
said, I said what cool
technology is out there he said
you should check out this NFMI

00:21:22.181,00:21:27.453
stuff um, but it’s a small group
of people within NXP. So, you’re
going to have to convince them

00:21:27.453,00:21:31.690
that-that you can that they
should even bother you know
supporting you, which I totally

00:21:31.690,00:21:36.862
get because they’re a huge
company and we’re-we’re just a-a
small conference. Um, so I wrote

00:21:36.862,00:21:40.599
them an email basically begging
them and explaining them about
Defcon and all the audience and

00:21:40.599,00:21:45.337
how cool it would be to kind of
share a new technology with
people and um they wrote back

00:21:45.337,00:21:49.141
and they’re like yes we want to
do it. And there was like 8
people or 7 or 8 people in this

00:21:49.141,00:21:54.180
group in Belgium that was the
NFMI team and they-they helped
out a huge amount I’ll-I’ll get

00:21:54.180,00:22:00.920
into that but the actual
technology itself um is usually
in hearing aids, kind of body

00:22:00.920,00:22:04.990
area network types of things so
short range because that
magnetic communication is with

00:22:04.990,00:22:08.861
the magnetic field and it
basically is you have a
transformer, we’re kind of

00:22:08.861,00:22:13.365
creating a transformer with an
air core, so normally we have a
transformer with um kind of a

00:22:13.365,00:22:19.004
material in the middle that br-
that kind of routes the magnetic
flux to the other side of the

00:22:19.004,00:22:23.976
transformer, but ours is sort of
an air transformer. And I like
to think about the communication

00:22:23.976,00:22:28.881
as like an air high five right
so like you’re like hey man and
um I’m just wearing this one on

00:22:28.881,00:22:33.319
my wrist but like hey man cool,
you don’t have to be like right
in their face so, I thought that

00:22:33.319,00:22:37.523
was kind of cool um, there are
some antenna related things not
that we really have to worry

00:22:37.523,00:22:42.695
about for this application but
the oh yeah the band with,
where’d I put that one, um oh

00:22:42.695,00:22:46.832
that’s on the uh where’d I put
that I don’t know it’s
somewhere, um yeah here it is.

00:22:46.832,00:22:53.272
So, the bandwidth is 596
kilobits a second which is
pretty fast, it’s like uh faster

00:22:53.272,00:22:58.544
than your typical modem and uh
it’s actually like for hearing
aids what it’s used for is to

00:22:58.544,00:23:02.581
transfer audio from one side,
you know one hearing aid to the
other side to synchronize audio.

00:23:02.581,00:23:07.653
We do see these also there’s a
few applications for consumer um
headphones, like high end

00:23:07.653,00:23:12.291
consumer headphones so you have
ear to ear and then you have ear
to bluetooth which is kind of

00:23:12.291,00:23:16.962
cool, but the coolest one that I
saw when I asked NXP uh about
what applications are there was

00:23:16.962,00:23:20.833
this like tactical
communications thing for
firefighters and other kinds of

00:23:20.833,00:23:26.205
public service where the-there
was a tooth microphone, like a
molar microphone and that would

00:23:26.205,00:23:32.077
transmit through infamy to some
other piece on your body and
that would transmit over radio.

00:23:32.077,00:23:37.883
So, like super spy stuff. Um,
yeah, so really, you know this
badge wouldn’t have-have gotten

00:23:37.883,00:23:42.187
done without a lot-a lot of
people’s help, and I’ll-I’ll
also mention that later but nxp

00:23:42.187,00:23:47.026
really stepped up here um you
know to help us, really to help
the community and that-that I

00:23:47.026,00:23:51.530
thought was really cool. The
Infamy radio is actually the
NFMI chip plus an ARM core

00:23:51.530,00:23:55.768
inside, so you actually have two
microcontrollers on this board,
one of them is running the radio

00:23:55.768,00:24:01.140
code and then one of them is
running the game code, you know
the DefCon code. So, um NXP

00:24:01.140,00:24:05.878
actually assigned an engineer
specifically to write the code
for that radio chip uh that

00:24:05.878,00:24:09.381
would be the broadcasting
functionality because if I had
to write that from the beginning

00:24:09.381,00:24:13.419
forget it. It would be not a 6
month, 8 month project it
would’ve been a multi year

00:24:13.419,00:24:18.791
project. Um, um, one of the
interesting things is their
documentation a-as a lot of

00:24:18.791,00:24:22.394
companies that have pretty
amazing technologies they
usually require like a non

00:24:22.394,00:24:27.900
disclosure agreement to be set
and-and you know you can’t
really see information and uh

00:24:27.900,00:24:31.804
but they they were so interested
in DefCon that we kinda came up
with this solution where we

00:24:31.804,00:24:34.773
don’t have to release all the
documentation and the radio
becomes this black box that we

00:24:34.773,00:24:39.011
can just use to send data to and
that’s all we need it for, like
we don’t really have to dive too

00:24:39.011,00:24:44.316
deep into it. Um, so there is
some custom code that is loaded
onto the radio chip on powerup

00:24:44.316,00:24:48.253
and that’s why when you plug in
your badge it plays a little
tune uh you’ll see the lights

00:24:48.253,00:24:54.393
kind of go from 3,2,1, that’s as
the code is loaded from the KL27
which has a like a just a binary

00:24:54.393,00:24:59.231
blob of the firmware for the
radio chip and that’s as it’s
loading. So it’s kind of a neat

00:24:59.231,00:25:03.035
technology there, and we
basically just have a few pins
going back and forth like

00:25:03.035,00:25:06.972
there’s a uart interface between
the two so if there’s a valid
packet that you read that gets

00:25:06.972,00:25:12.945
sent over to the KL27 and then
we can process it. So, here’s
something that might be of

00:25:12.945,00:25:17.383
interest if you’re- if you’re
hacking on things. Um, I
intentionally did not release

00:25:17.383,00:25:21.787
sort of the-the different states
of things, but I will probably
on Sunday. Uh, but this is the

00:25:21.787,00:25:26.392
packet that actually gets sent,
that gets broadcast from every
badge and gets received from

00:25:26.392,00:25:30.195
every badge if you’re within
range. So, there’s a unique
identifier, um there’s the badge

00:25:30.195,00:25:35.200
type so there’s like a 10, 9 or
10 I can’t even remember I was
so like crazy about this,

00:25:37.436,00:25:41.807
there’s some large number you
can look in the code and figure
it out. Um, magic token flag

00:25:41.807,00:25:45.611
which I’ll get to, game flags
and then there’s an unused byte
also. So, if you end up hacking

00:25:45.611,00:25:49.381
this firmware you can not only
transmit your own badge data but
you can transmit other data,

00:25:49.381,00:25:53.719
right? If you add a sensor or if
you add something else and make
some other thing with it or you

00:25:53.719,00:25:57.089
can just clober this whole
packet and create your own
stuff. Because the code is there

00:25:57.089,00:26:02.561
on our control side, you can
just send whatever data you want
into the, into the the radio

00:26:02.561,00:26:07.232
chip and then that’s going to
start broadcasting it. So, you
have the LED driver as well,

00:26:07.232,00:26:13.472
this is the other kind of main
portion this one was sort of
crazy this was like oh- oh yeah

00:26:13.472,00:26:17.910
okay right how many people can
be in the area yeah, so that’s
great, so a lot of radio you

00:26:17.910,00:26:21.647
know you have point to point or
you might have a mesh network or
something. The way that this

00:26:21.647,00:26:27.119
thing works is that we basically
have a pseudo random generated
time where each badge is

00:26:27.119,00:26:30.589
transmitting and each badge is
receiving and then it sleeps the
rest of the time and I’ll show

00:26:30.589,00:26:35.394
you what that power cycle looks
like at the end. Um, so it can
be a one to many or a many to

00:26:35.394,00:26:40.399
one sort of situation. We don’t
even know how many badges can be
cone- can be communicating at

00:26:40.399,00:26:46.238
the same time, but it’s-it’s
more than 10. Uh, which is cool
for a group sort of chat thing

00:26:46.238,00:26:50.042
to trade data between them. Um,
which is kind of cool and you
know NXP as they designed it

00:26:50.042,00:26:53.879
they’re like we’ve never done it
with this many and that’s part
of the fun of like who knows

00:26:53.879,00:26:58.083
what’s going to happen and in
that situation you know, you can
just all stand together and see

00:26:58.083,00:27:00.819
if there’s if the lights are
blinking on your badges you know
they’re communicating and that’s

00:27:00.819,00:27:07.793
kind of cool. Oh yeah, okay
right, great idea geeze I should
just have you give the talk. Um,

00:27:07.793,00:27:12.598
Jeff’s remembering all these
w-worthy things. Um, so, yeah,
because its pseudo random the-

00:27:12.598,00:27:17.336
the detection time can vary from
like 5 milliseconds if you just
happen to be at the right state

00:27:17.336,00:27:21.840
at the right time or, it might
take a few seconds, um which I
think is why people are moving

00:27:21.840,00:27:25.611
closer and closer to each other
as they’re doing communication
and then it finally works, but

00:27:25.611,00:27:29.615
the more badges you have, the
more potential there are for
data collision and then it waits

00:27:29.615,00:27:33.852
you know some random number of
time and does it again so it
could take 5, 10 seconds maybe

00:27:33.852,00:27:37.523
you know the more badges you
have the more time it will take,
and that actually comes into

00:27:37.523,00:27:43.929
play for the final stage, uh
which I’m not going to tell you
anymore than that but multiple

00:27:43.929,00:27:49.501
chat, group chat is required.
Um, so this LED driver you might
notice the different-different

00:27:49.501,00:27:54.773
badge types so human, speaker,
goon the ones that have colored
gemstones have matching colored

00:27:54.773,00:27:59.044
LEDs uh and that was a way for
goons out in the conference to
be able to easily identify

00:27:59.044,00:28:04.349
people. That’s a hard thing to
do, like having red and green
LEDs are easy, having white,

00:28:04.349,00:28:10.956
blue, purple, um and even the
green, the green that we have is
a high, high uh 4 voltage, and

00:28:10.956,00:28:15.694
you can’t normally run that very
well off of a coin cell for very
long, especially if you’re doing

00:28:15.694,00:28:18.697
multiple of them. So, this was a
last minute addition this TI
LP5569 that takes in through I

00:28:18.697,00:28:21.066
squared C a common interchip
communication protocol um, the
data to drive each LED and it

00:28:21.066,00:28:26.071
has a little boost converter in
there so it can take are coin
cell down to about 2 volts and

00:28:28.640,00:28:33.645
still drive the LEDs so it
really is a very very low power
system that we have here. Uh and

00:28:35.981,00:28:38.617
this saved us because now we
could have different colors like
we originally we’re just gonna

00:28:38.617,00:28:44.189
have a single color kind of
pulsing and we were like that’s
kind of lame. So, here- here’s

00:28:44.189,00:28:48.193
the fun stuff, these are mostly
pictures I think from this point
on. Um, some of our early

00:28:48.193,00:28:53.165
concepts uh I went up to Seattle
to meet up with- with DT and
some of the other guys and we’re

00:28:53.165,00:28:58.437
like what can we do? When I
first saw the the picture um
that Jeff sent of the woman

00:28:58.437,00:29:03.542
holding the laptop and the
pastel colors and the happiness
like that just hit me so hard I

00:29:03.542,00:29:08.313
was like we need something like
this. You know, like we normally
are wearing all black and I

00:29:08.313,00:29:13.151
couldn’t find any colors to wear
up here so I have to buy some,
but you know it’s like DefCon

00:29:13.151,00:29:17.756
themes have been dark and this
was just uplifting and I saw
that and like for some reason I

00:29:17.756,00:29:23.762
was like gemstones right? Like
gems are so cool and uh we’re
like how can we integrate

00:29:23.762,00:29:29.001
something soft, natural material
because technology is so much
like hard and um so we’re like

00:29:29.001,00:29:32.371
how can we get a gem and we’re
like okay let’s go to the gem
store and buy some gems and see

00:29:32.371,00:29:38.477
what see what works and we knew
nothing about this, like th- you
know I sit in-in my lab and

00:29:38.477,00:29:42.648
design electronics, I don’t know
about jewelry. Um, but we wanted
to figure out how to make it

00:29:42.648,00:29:45.917
work. It just seemed to make
sense. So these are some of the
drawings like sticky- sticky

00:29:45.917,00:29:50.889
note drawings what’s that? Oh
yeah that’s right that’s Jeff’s
watch, we’re sitting in the um

00:29:50.889,00:29:55.394
we’re sitting in that Mexican
place and I remember drinking
like some caffeine and I was

00:29:55.394,00:29:59.197
like like if you think I’m
wandering around now that was a
funny meeting because I could

00:29:59.197,00:30:04.503
not stop talking and uh we-we
grabbed this and like the watch
was electronics and then the cup

00:30:04.503,00:30:07.572
was supposed to be the gemstone
and we’re like oh we’ll just
drill through the gemstone and

00:30:07.572,00:30:11.943
put the electronics inside not
knowing that that’s really hard
because gems are like you know

00:30:11.943,00:30:16.882
rock and they’re hard [laughter]
hahaha you might have noted that
but I didn’t really think about

00:30:16.882,00:30:21.553
that. I was like they have drill
bits, like just drill through
the thing. Um but it didn’t

00:30:21.553,00:30:25.157
quite- didn’t quite work like
that. So, over time I’ll get to
the hunting for the treasure

00:30:25.157,00:30:28.560
part because that’s pretty fun,
um but here are some of the
other kind of pictures of the

00:30:28.560,00:30:33.298
development process. This is
something that started in
January, um we started ordering

00:30:33.298,00:30:37.769
components for this project
January, February, before we
could verify that anything

00:30:37.769,00:30:43.642
actually worked, and that was
scary because we’re spending
DefCon’s money and taking this

00:30:43.642,00:30:49.347
huge risk uh basically on you
know on the word of what people
are working with of NXP who had

00:30:49.347,00:30:52.617
developed this technology and
and just of experience of like
alright if we have a micro

00:30:52.617,00:30:57.089
controller it should connect to
the radio like that makes sense.
Um, we did have evaluation

00:30:57.089,00:31:01.827
boards for the radio and for the
LED driver just to evaluate with
our computer and with some of

00:31:01.827,00:31:06.798
their boards uh, but it was a
huge, huge risk and I definitely
got more gray hair over this for

00:31:06.798,00:31:10.969
sure. Uh, but we started with
like on the left it’s just a
milled out circuit board to

00:31:10.969,00:31:15.240
simulate the-the badge and had
some different color LEDs. You
can see my schematic which is

00:31:15.240,00:31:20.245
like a road map of- of how an
electronic circuit is designed,
started off as one thing and

00:31:20.245,00:31:24.649
then as I start refining things
and scribble and it becomes a
mess and then it gets refined

00:31:24.649,00:31:28.687
again, this picture is of the
circuit board layout, I’m using
um altium designer here who's

00:31:28.687,00:31:32.858
been a -a big supporter of me
for a long time which has been
great because it’s an actual

00:31:32.858,00:31:36.995
tool that we can do some crazy
stuff with and especially with
this circuit board, I don’t know

00:31:36.995,00:31:41.933
if you’ve noticed but those
parts are really tiny right?
They’re like really tiny. Um,

00:31:41.933,00:31:46.338
doing layout for a system like
that there’s a whole bunch of-of
crazy stuff, I have the circuit

00:31:46.338,00:31:49.508
board stack up in the extended
version of the slides, not this
one, but we have things called

00:31:49.508,00:31:53.445
via in pad which are little
inter layer circuit board
communications underneath the

00:31:53.445,00:31:59.417
chips um uh our circuit board
connections and it’s just a very
difficult manufacturing process

00:31:59.417,00:32:03.922
so this-this tool has saved me
for sure. Here’s some other
pictures of when we got the

00:32:03.922,00:32:09.995
prototypes back um so basically
we went to Defcon China, the day
before we went to Defcon China I

00:32:09.995,00:32:15.100
had to get the prototype sent
out to fab so when we got back
from Defcon China 2 weeks later

00:32:15.100,00:32:19.237
we had the prototype I had 7
days to write enough low level
firmware to make sure that the

00:32:19.237,00:32:25.277
system worked so we could order
28,000 of them a week later
literally 7 days later um,

00:32:25.277,00:32:30.182
highly not recommended like
don’t do that it was really it
was really, really hard and

00:32:30.182,00:32:35.187
there was nights of just like uh
yeah don’t do that. Um, and so
we went from 6 prototypes to

00:32:37.522,00:32:42.494
28,000 units without even being
able to verify the final changes
I made for production um which

00:32:42.494,00:32:46.464
was really nerve wracking and it
was a lot of money even we got a
you know great deal on

00:32:46.464,00:32:50.569
manufacturing but this stuff
costs, this stuff costs money
and I didn’t want to be

00:32:50.569,00:32:54.973
responsible for like the
downfall of Defcon by spending
all this money on something that

00:32:54.973,00:32:59.477
doesn’t work. So there’s sort of
that-that stress of trying to
please people and then also be

00:32:59.477,00:33:03.915
within budget um, which I
actually went way over budget by
the way so I’m gonna tell you on

00:33:03.915,00:33:08.520
the stage so you can’t like
strangle me [laughter] I’m just
warning you now. Hahaha uh but

00:33:08.520,00:33:14.960
at some point, you can’t so like
the ball is rolling so fast
you-you can’t go backwards

00:33:14.960,00:33:19.965
right? And it was like we had to
get things done for this day, so
we had to pay to get it done.

00:33:19.965,00:33:26.638
I’m glad- I’m glad it made it.
So, part of the fun part was
learning about gems and this is

00:33:26.638,00:33:32.510
really I think where kind of the
hacker spirit helped out. Going
into this industry, going into

00:33:32.510,00:33:38.950
this world how the hell do we
find a place to get essentially
30,000 units, actually it was

00:33:38.950,00:33:44.723
30,000 units of a- of a gem,
like is this even gonna work?
So, I happened to be on a trip

00:33:44.723,00:33:51.263
to Texas and oh- oh right
hahahahahaha, so we have a local
gem store like a new age store

00:33:51.263,00:33:57.702
near- near my house I’m in
Portland so there’s a new age
store on every block um, so I

00:33:57.702,00:34:00.639
went in there and like picked
some stones and they were
awesome like foun- found ones I

00:34:00.639,00:34:05.777
think might work and I talked to
the guy and I’m like so you know
you have a few out there like

00:34:05.777,00:34:11.716
can you guys get me 30,000 of
something and he’s like that’s a
lot, he’s like even we can’t do

00:34:11.716,00:34:16.221
that and I’m like well what do I
do? And he said well this- this
show called the Tucson gem show

00:34:16.221,00:34:22.427
that’s you can sort of think
about it as like a gem show, you
know like Defcon but for gem

00:34:22.427,00:34:26.932
people of all levels and I see
some people nodding their heads
have you been to the Tucson gem

00:34:26.932,00:34:31.937
show it’s like it’s crazy yeah
uh gems haha [laughter] so, um
it’s 50,000 people over 2 weeks

00:34:36.541,00:34:42.881
going to this event. Collectors,
retailers, wholesalers, mine
owners, everything along the way

00:34:42.881,00:34:49.387
and we had 36 hours to figure
out what to do. I happened to be
in Texas doing some work and uh

00:34:49.387,00:34:52.891
I called up Jeff and I’m like
“hey there’s this gem show” he’s
like “just go there on the way

00:34:52.891,00:34:58.797
home” I’m like alright. So I
booked a hotel in-in what turned
out to be you remember like the

00:34:58.797,00:35:04.336
old Defcon days where the hotels
were super s****y? This was
like- this was one of those. Um,

00:35:04.336,00:35:08.506
but it happened to be one that
had a bunch of vendors, actually
all of them had vendors in them

00:35:08.506,00:35:12.177
but this one had vendors that
actually helped out um which was
really good, it was a good

00:35:12.177,00:35:17.349
starting point and um so I got
there dropped all my stuff in
the presidential suite, I don’t

00:35:17.349,00:35:20.652
have a picture of it but it said
presidential suite and then
there was like all this stuff

00:35:20.652,00:35:25.657
torn off and you go in and it’s
just it looks like um uh Alexis
park or something yeah I was

00:35:27.726,00:35:33.398
like wow gems um [laughter]
haha. Oh yeah, so this was like
the first picture, so I check

00:35:33.398,00:35:37.369
into the hotel I go down, I go
to th- I try to find a retailer
somebody that has the

00:35:37.369,00:35:43.274
connections to wholesalers to
sell stuff so this-this picture
here is who would sell to

00:35:43.274,00:35:49.014
the-the-the local stores so your
local gem store would buy from a
place like this. I walked in

00:35:49.014,00:35:54.352
there and was like holy s***
like look at all those gems
[laughter] and it went on and on

00:35:54.352,00:35:59.357
and on for miles all around all
around um Tucson. So, I sent
this picture to Jeff and I’m

00:35:59.357,00:36:03.294
like I don’t know what we’re
going to do. So, what made it
even harder is I went to talk to

00:36:03.294,00:36:07.065
the owner of this company and I
was like yeah I’m doing this
thing for Defcon it’s a hacker

00:36:07.065,00:36:10.835
conference and anytime you say
that they’re like hackers that’s
scary why do you want gems? I’m

00:36:10.835,00:36:15.840
like I’m not really sure yet ha
[laughter] something to do with
lasers I don’t know [laughter]

00:36:18.043,00:36:23.081
uh, so but that’s how you get
their attention and it actually
worked so I- I was like we need

00:36:23.081,00:36:26.951
30,000 he was like we can’t do
that. I’m like oh oh my God what
are we going to do? He’s like

00:36:26.951,00:36:32.090
but you should talk to this guy.
So, I went to that guy which was
like walk down a mile sort of

00:36:32.090,00:36:36.327
like walking down the strip but
it’s empty, you go to this other
building you find this other guy

00:36:36.327,00:36:40.932
you say this guy sent me and um
but it is very instant like all
these people know each other, so

00:36:40.932,00:36:44.836
it’s a lot of personal
connections. So, I ended up
finding this wholesaler um but

00:36:44.836,00:36:49.441
then they couldn’t help out but
I learned how most gemstones are
shipped in these giant um what

00:36:49.441,00:36:53.545
are they the oil drums like you
had in Defcon China? Giant oil
drums wrapped in paper so it’s

00:36:53.545,00:36:57.749
like you see, you know you go to
your new age store and it’s like
mystical quartz crystal that

00:36:57.749,00:37:00.852
helps you with whatever but like
they don’t really care they’re
just shipped in these massive

00:37:00.852,00:37:05.123
things like they’re not that
special they’re stones. Um,
[laughter] and that really like

00:37:05.123,00:37:10.128
that kind of ruined me you know
because I really wanted to
believe [laughter] and um

00:37:10.128,00:37:16.334
[chuckle] I don’t know, it’s
just one of many things that
ruined me in this project

00:37:16.334,00:37:20.705
[laughter] so anyway I found a
place, I walked by a local place
called Norcross Madagascar

00:37:20.705,00:37:24.209
that’s a huge company that makes
a lot of like the carvings that
you see of things you know

00:37:24.209,00:37:28.513
different carvings that you get
made out of gems um and I went
into they’re a local company in

00:37:28.513,00:37:32.684
Tucson and I went in and I said
hey I’m working on Defcon and
they looked at me like wh- who

00:37:32.684,00:37:37.088
is this guy and um I ended up
meeting with the president of
the company. The owner of this

00:37:37.088,00:37:42.427
company who I don’t know, maybe
it’s fate had the same last name
as me except the d was a t

00:37:42.427,00:37:48.399
people always get that confused
Grand and Grant so that was it,
we like connected to that and um

00:37:48.399,00:37:52.604
he was awesome. So, I basically
sat down with him for an hour
and he owns a mine in Madagascar

00:37:52.604,00:37:56.608
that makes um agate so I’m
trying to figure out, we don’t
even know what material we’re

00:37:56.608,00:38:00.812
going to use yet by the way. So,
I start talking to him and he
was basically my mentor that 1

00:38:00.812,00:38:05.717
hour of like y-you can’t do it
this way y-you know you’re not
going to be able to get it done,

00:38:05.717,00:38:08.820
you can’t use glue because you
have to do this and it really
helped me a-but he was like I

00:38:08.820,00:38:12.590
don’t think we’re going to be
able to get this done in time
for you. Because I think we had

00:38:12.590,00:38:15.226
6 or 8 weeks or something to
work with. Um, he said but you
need to talk to this guy.

00:38:15.226,00:38:19.063
[laughter] Ha and that was it
like I had 15 minutes to get to
this to this show before it

00:38:19.063,00:38:22.867
closed, big trade show for
wholesalers only, um and I have
a business certificate so I

00:38:22.867,00:38:26.938
could get in he said you’ve
gotta talk to this person there
like get on whatsapp and do it.

00:38:26.938,00:38:31.109
And I’m like what’s whatsapp?
And uh cause I don’t I don’t use
technology, I design it I don’t

00:38:31.109,00:38:38.016
use it [laughter] and um so I
load whatsapp on my phone while
I'm waiting for the taxi to come

00:38:38.016,00:38:41.586
and uh I get over there and I
rush through and I run back
there and I’d already tex-

00:38:41.586,00:38:47.458
whatsapp whatever whatapped
whatever you call it, texted,
sent the message and um said I’m

00:38:47.458,00:38:51.362
on my way, you know Robert
recommended me and that’s the
end because a lot of larger

00:38:51.362,00:38:54.866
factories you can’t just walk up
and say hey can you build
something for me? Um so I went

00:38:54.866,00:38:59.571
over there and met with Miss
Rainbow and she like totally
hooked us up. I was like Defcon

00:38:59.571,00:39:03.942
we have 15 minutes and she sent
me samples of what we wanted and
then from there it was just like

00:39:03.942,00:39:08.479
to the races. So, pretty-pretty
crazy um that we were able to
pull that off. And I-I don’t

00:39:08.479,00:39:11.416
know why I put this in there,
there’s just like beautiful
stuff right it’s like even if

00:39:11.416,00:39:16.421
you don’t like appreciate things
this is all like under the Earth
right? Like Earth is sort of

00:39:19.757,00:39:24.762
beautiful if you get rid of the
humans [laughter]. Um, or- or
yeah you put robots instead

00:39:27.765,00:39:32.670
that’s gonna yeah that’ll work.
Um, hahaha so, oh by the way so
that thing on the right that’s

00:39:32.670,00:39:38.943
just like a hundred million year
old like mosasaur fossil just
sitting there alright so you can

00:39:38.943,00:39:42.580
get like crazy stuff. We
originally were going to use
agates that’s like dyed agate um

00:39:42.580,00:39:47.085
but there was too many
variations in the material to
make it work. So, we ended up

00:39:47.085,00:39:51.923
using hand cut crystal from from
uh from Brazil, I didn’t know it
was going to be hand cut, I’ll

00:39:51.923,00:39:58.062
get to that and as you notice,
every single gem is different.
Right? Every badge is unique

00:39:58.062,00:40:05.036
just like all of you hahah
[laughter] uh I’ve been waiting
to say that for like 6 months

00:40:05.036,00:40:10.041
hahaha [laughter] [applause].
But it’s true right? Like, it’s
true like we really are all

00:40:14.245,00:40:17.982
different and the gems are too
and I was like you know some of
them have cracks right? Some of

00:40:17.982,00:40:23.788
you got them and they were
already broken. That’s life,
that’s natural hahaha but you

00:40:23.788,00:40:27.592
can actually go and fix them we
have extra we have extra
materials don’t worry. Um,

00:40:27.592,00:40:31.629
anyways so the strength varies
depending on the thing but it
starts in the mine, lower left

00:40:31.629,00:40:37.035
is a picture of the mine where
these gems came from. Middle one
are-are-are the gems in their

00:40:37.035,00:40:41.839
natural habitat before we rip
them up and destroy them. And
then on the right you could see

00:40:41.839,00:40:45.944
the size of like a-a quartz
crystal that we used like it’s
about this big and heavy like

00:40:45.944,00:40:52.917
rocks are heavy too by the way
[laughter]. So, when I hooked up
with Eon which was this gem huge

00:40:52.917,00:40:58.056
gem and jewelry manufacturer, we
did all of this site unseen
based on the trust and the

00:40:58.056,00:41:04.062
reputation of you know of Robert
from-from Norcross. Um, but when
the project was done when we

00:41:04.062,00:41:07.298
were in Defcon China I said hey
I’m already in the area can I
visit the factory and they said

00:41:07.298,00:41:11.903
sure so I got to actually go to
the factory, they already had
all 30,000 gemstones done in

00:41:11.903,00:41:16.040
huge boxes so, got to take a
picture with that which was cool
but then they said let’s show

00:41:16.040,00:41:19.243
you how the gems were made
because I thought that that
would be like the actual useful

00:41:19.243,00:41:24.315
part of this for you to see. Um,
and mind blowing because it’s
not technology but it’s still

00:41:24.315,00:41:28.186
very technical, very skilled and
this is where I found out that
somebody’s actually cutting them

00:41:28.186,00:41:32.657
by hand not like drilling them
out it’s a very manual process.
Um, so you start with this big

00:41:32.657,00:41:38.529
uh this big gem block you cut
that, then you put it another
machine you cut that and you

00:41:38.529,00:41:42.333
make slices um that are the
same-same width as what we want
which I think is uh 5

00:41:42.333,00:41:48.539
millimeters and then somebody
sits with the slices and draws
the outline of the badge with a

00:41:48.539,00:41:53.544
pencil. And then this is the
cool part, so here’s a video of
one of the one of the-the people

00:41:55.880,00:42:00.818
there one of the um jewelry
manufacturers taking a really
sharp disc and then just hand

00:42:04.922,00:42:09.927
cutting and look like no gloves
[laughter] yeaaahhhh you could
say I was a little clenched

00:42:14.565,00:42:19.971
watching him. It’s-it’s
fascinating like to see this
world and to see like this is

00:42:19.971,00:42:25.076
how you know all the fancy
jewelry is made, somebody’s
actually making it. Every little

00:42:25.076,00:42:29.147
ball of a- of a bracelet or of a
necklace is handcrafted and
that-that was pretty eye

00:42:29.147,00:42:34.585
opening. So, the discs are made
then they’re piled they’re um
kind of sanded a little bit more

00:42:34.585,00:42:39.924
to be shaped- hand shaped, and
put into these super loud
vibrating machines, I should’ve

00:42:39.924,00:42:43.961
taken a video with audio just to
like blast your ears out but
it’s a whole room full of these

00:42:43.961,00:42:48.766
things that polish the gem. And
then some of them were dyed
depending on the on the badge

00:42:48.766,00:42:53.271
color. Um, so there’s me with
the team that-that helped out
and they were the management for

00:42:53.271,00:42:57.175
all of the all of the staff
underneath. But it was actually
cool to see to see a lot of the

00:42:57.175,00:43:00.845
workers and and wave to them
cause they’re working but like
they knew who I was cause they

00:43:00.845,00:43:05.183
were you know had made all of
these for us and it was like
really, really cool. Um, there

00:43:05.183,00:43:09.454
are the boxes and these are the
pictures of the first dyed
gemstones that we got back. So

00:43:09.454,00:43:13.157
it really was a fascinating sort
of experience and we didn’t know
like how would the light shine

00:43:13.157,00:43:17.695
through how would the variation
be um but it was worth you know
worth trying anyway and I think

00:43:17.695,00:43:22.700
it turned out alright. So, as
far as the code of the system
it’s a 64 kilobyte flash device

00:43:25.002,00:43:29.107
the KL27 so we’re using a lot of
it and-and that’s with
optimization turned on, without

00:43:29.107,00:43:33.711
optimization I was over the over
the the amount of memory and-and
I got really scared until I

00:43:33.711,00:43:38.082
realized I didn’t turn I hadn’t
had optimization on so now I do
and it’s good. It’s just hard to

00:43:38.082,00:43:42.120
debug because when you optimize
code it’s you know you’re you’re
going all over your prothom

00:43:42.120,00:43:46.224
count is going all over the
place um the actual number of
source lines for the project is

00:43:46.224,00:43:51.729
3,000 just for the badge
main-main dot c basically all of
the library functions and all of

00:43:51.729,00:43:57.368
that stuff is separate. So, if
you look through the code just
remember like I’m a hardware guy

00:43:57.368,00:44:03.174
um I’m not a software developer,
I can write low level code and
um you know previous Defcon

00:44:03.174,00:44:09.747
years I would actually apologize
in my code for things but I
don’t apologize anymore haha

00:44:09.747,00:44:15.386
[laughter]. Just look at it and
change it and and you know make
it do something cooler. So, the

00:44:15.386,00:44:20.391
development environment um is
also these development tools are
on the Defcon media server so if

00:44:20.391,00:44:23.928
you want to set up your your
project and start hacking on the
code you can do it we use

00:44:23.928,00:44:29.567
MCUXPRESSO which is just the
standard um NXP um development
environment totally free uh we

00:44:29.567,00:44:33.437
use the KL27 SDK and that
consists of some of the low
level libraries that you need

00:44:33.437,00:44:39.877
for different interfacing. Um,
but the badge really is a you
know general purpose environment

00:44:39.877,00:44:44.549
with a radio and with LEDs. Um,
so you could create some cool
blinky functionality or do some

00:44:44.549,00:44:49.620
other radio communication like I
talked about and really expand
on that. For hardware hackers uh

00:44:49.620,00:44:53.324
there’s two different
connections, the first one is
the more complicated one this is

00:44:53.324,00:44:59.931
SWD serial wire debug which is a
um subset of the Jtag standards
so sort of for programming and

00:44:59.931,00:45:04.835
debug interface you’re you need
some sort of programmer so the
LPC LINK 2 is what I used as the

00:45:04.835,00:45:09.840
hardware interface. Um, the
black magic probe uh by Peter
Esden is uh also usable open

00:45:12.076,00:45:15.279
source people have already been
using it and hacking on it and
hacker warehouse has those for

00:45:15.279,00:45:19.784
sale uh but you do need this tag
connect cable which we have some
of this hardware by the way in

00:45:19.784,00:45:25.890
the hardware hacking village
also um and I’ll-I’ll get to
that uh pretty soon, and you

00:45:25.890,00:45:30.795
plug this connector onto those
test points and that will
communicate you can load the

00:45:30.795,00:45:34.031
code in you can extract the code
if you wanted to but you already
have the code on the media

00:45:34.031,00:45:37.802
server. Modify the code, load it
in and have it do other stuff.
You know, maybe change your-

00:45:37.802,00:45:42.173
change your data packet to
unlock everybody’s badge or
something. Uh, but I think for

00:45:42.173,00:45:46.143
the en- more entry level people
who are curious about hardware
hacking but haven’t done it this

00:45:46.143,00:45:50.881
UR interface is the place to
start. And this is a standard
sort of communication interface

00:45:50.881,00:45:54.919
used for debug outputs sometimes
on devices you find it and you
get dropped into a root shell so

00:45:54.919,00:45:59.824
you can hack on things uh when
you connect here you get a
command based interactive menu

00:45:59.824,00:46:03.361
so you can control different
aspects of the badge, see the
state, when you read someone

00:46:03.361,00:46:07.598
else’s badge it dumps the-the
packet information, so it’s a
cool way to kind of learn what’s

00:46:07.598,00:46:13.170
going on when you actually
complete the entire quest, um
this mode enables some extra

00:46:13.170,00:46:17.708
commands that are sort of artsy
and hacky and like there’s some-
some neat things you can do

00:46:17.708,00:46:22.713
there. So, um, oh and this is
something too this is at 1 point
8 volt UART most people hacking

00:46:24.749,00:46:29.887
on things are at 3 point 3 volts
or 5, low power systems, like
what we’re using 1 point 8 volts

00:46:29.887,00:46:32.690
and it’s sort of good practice I
was like well it’s kind of
annoying cause it’s lower

00:46:32.690,00:46:36.794
voltage but that’s part of
progressing with hacking is like
let’s figure out how can we use

00:46:36.794,00:46:41.465
different tools to do the same
job? Black Magic crib will work
for this, um the Jtagulator will

00:46:41.465,00:46:45.636
work if you set the target
voltage to 1 point 8 volts use
the pass through mode, um the

00:46:45.636,00:46:50.841
bus pirate should work uh any
FTDI or USB to serial adapter
that supports 1 point 8 volts

00:46:50.841,00:46:57.014
lot’s of ways to do it and you
just hook up to those pins
1,2,3,4. Here’s a few pictures

00:46:57.014,00:47:02.119
of fabrication um of the boards
being made, I think this one has
some videos, this is the

00:47:02.119,00:47:07.591
assembly so if you’ve ever seen
circuit boards being assembled
before, uh it’s cool like robots

00:47:07.591,00:47:12.596
right so um here’s some robots
putting components on the board,
there’s 12 badges per panel, so

00:47:15.032,00:47:21.539
we made 28,000 pieces sooo
someone do the math. 2,000
panels or something I don’t know

00:47:21.539,00:47:24.842
it’s a lot so this things
putting the components on and
then it it shoots out of that

00:47:24.842,00:47:29.814
and goes to this machine it’s
called an AOI, automated optical
inspection that optically does

00:47:29.814,00:47:33.551
some computer vision to make
sure that the components are
right it compares it to a known

00:47:33.551,00:47:38.322
good like a gold standard. So
this is checking every single,
every single board one by one to

00:47:38.322,00:47:42.593
make sure the parts are are on
there properly. Um and if
they’re not then you’ll see a

00:47:42.593,00:47:48.899
big fail, like a big red box
fail. I think this one actually
says good, um, and this is

00:47:48.899,00:47:51.836
something that is required
because every step of the way
there’s variations in the

00:47:51.836,00:47:55.106
process like the reels of
components that come from the
manufacturer you would expect

00:47:55.106,00:47:59.009
all of them to be perfect. But
they’re not sometimes components
are upside down or-or whatever

00:47:59.009,00:48:03.314
so this machine will test will
test for that look for it and
they can fix the issue before it

00:48:03.314,00:48:10.087
goes into a reflow oven which is
like a giant cookie making
machine uh that one by one the

00:48:10.087,00:48:15.960
boards come out and this is full
speed so you can imagine making
2,000 of these sti- sitting here

00:48:15.960,00:48:20.965
like uh kay [laughter]. We can
almost look at it now like it’s
almost there but then watch this

00:48:25.402,00:48:30.574
it gets really fast it’s like
yeah it’s like a pizza right?
And there’s actually at

00:48:30.574,00:48:33.844
engineering trade shows you’ll
see people who sell these
machines and they’ll put cookies

00:48:33.844,00:48:37.748
through or put pizza through or
something. So now it comes out
and then it like shoots along

00:48:37.748,00:48:42.953
this rail and you’re like stop
like don’t go, don’t go over the
edge and it comes out and it

00:48:42.953,00:48:48.692
like keeps going and it’s like
oh my God it’s going to go over
the edge and then it stops. So,

00:48:48.692,00:48:51.328
that has to happen over and over
again and then it goes through
the testing and all of that so

00:48:51.328,00:48:56.634
it really is like a long term
process. What’s cool about this
is Fusion EMS is the company

00:48:56.634,00:49:00.337
that I used to do this, local
factory that was another
decision of staying local so I

00:49:00.337,00:49:04.175
could drive to the factory and
say hey we’re putting gems on
things and they’re like okay

00:49:04.175,00:49:08.779
we’ve never done that but we can
[laughter]- we can figure out
how to do it and uh you know I

00:49:08.779,00:49:12.883
was there a lot and I think
everytime I went there they’re
like oh God Joes back. Um, but

00:49:12.883,00:49:16.587
we got it working, we got the
process working and here’s some
x-ray images of it just to show

00:49:16.587,00:49:20.958
the little Defcon logo hidden on
an inside layer of the circuit
board that you can’t see from

00:49:20.958,00:49:26.297
the outside, I thought that was
a cool trick. Yeah, you need
x-ray eyes that’ll be like maybe

00:49:26.297,00:49:31.068
that’ll be at Defcon 54 by the
time that happens. Um, and then
final assembly we had the

00:49:31.068,00:49:35.673
factory this is why we’re over
budget by the way the factory
had to hire 20 temp workers,

00:49:35.673,00:49:39.777
like high school students and
and college students who were
interested in-in engineering um

00:49:39.777,00:49:43.347
to work at the factory to do
some of this labor of putting
this the adhesive on the

00:49:43.347,00:49:47.451
gemstone, the-the it’s double
sided tape by the way putting
the adhesive onto the gemstone

00:49:47.451,00:49:51.121
putting the gemstone on for the
final assembly. Um, and they
learned a lot, I got to talk

00:49:51.121,00:49:55.826
with them and talk about Defcon
and hacking so it was like kind
of satisfying. Here are the

00:49:55.826,00:49:59.296
final numbers uh mostly human of
course and then there’s all the
other ones if you want to

00:49:59.296,00:50:03.734
collect them all. Some of the
gemstones are more see through
than others so we wanted to put

00:50:03.734,00:50:08.405
some cool artwork underneath so
depending on the variation of
the gem you can still see it uh

00:50:08.405,00:50:13.611
these are you know different
colors in the artwork under
there before we put the gems on.

00:50:13.611,00:50:18.716
Okay, if you’re doing the badge
quest this is important. Um,
these are the tasks that you

00:50:18.716,00:50:25.389
need to complete at Defcon, the
first task you do is you just
communicate with somebody and I

00:50:25.389,00:50:29.360
didn’t mention this but it was
in the slides the LED pattern of
the state your in actually

00:50:29.360,00:50:32.796
indicates what state your in so
you might be like oh there just
doing something but those-those

00:50:32.796,00:50:37.768
states, the LEDs tell you what
state your in, um the first
state is just communicating with

00:50:37.768,00:50:44.008
a friend or anybody then the
next 5 states have to be going
and doing Defcon so you go to

00:50:44.008,00:50:49.146
arts you do a you go to you go
to a show um, you go to a talk
you go to a village you

00:50:49.146,00:50:54.318
participate in a contest or you
watch a contest, you go to a
party, and that um there it’s

00:50:54.318,00:50:58.923
not- it’s not a person who has a
speaker badge, the goons within
those different groups that are

00:50:58.923,00:51:03.961
working those areas, have the
magic tokens. And, these are
different stones that are very

00:51:03.961,00:51:08.465
visible um of different types
and they have the flag that when
you communicate with it it

00:51:08.465,00:51:12.836
advances the state. And the
intent there was there’s so many
people behind the scenes at

00:51:12.836,00:51:18.075
Defcon you cannot even imagine
um like i’m in one little
communication group just for the

00:51:18.075,00:51:22.012
badge and there’s 10 or
something of us I don’t even
know how many hundreds, how many

00:51:22.012,00:51:27.551
goons and stuff are there?
Behind the scenes people? Yeah,
so 500 goons, and then all of

00:51:27.551,00:51:33.591
the Defcon staff, artists and
everybody who’s participating
too, it’s huge so I thought this

00:51:33.591,00:51:38.162
would be a cool way to like
interact with the volunteers and
say thank you um and then you

00:51:38.162,00:51:43.901
know give them an air high five
and- and get your- get your your
uh flag so um I thought that was

00:51:43.901,00:51:49.440
kind of cool. Battery life
should last 4 days depending on
what mode your in um this is

00:51:49.440,00:51:55.245
amazing cause the radio turns on
transmits, goes to sleep and its
uh point 61 milliamps average

00:51:55.245,00:51:59.216
while the radio is
communicating. That’s that’s
very very small it’s like

00:51:59.216,00:52:03.587
sipping power, it’s pretty wild.
Um, and the LEDs are what take
up the most power so if you’re

00:52:03.587,00:52:07.624
in the attract mode the whole
time you’re battery’s gonna die
sooner but we hope it should

00:52:07.624,00:52:11.595
still last through the
conference 4 days is 96 hours
and if we bring the battery down

00:52:11.595,00:52:17.034
to 2 volts 2 point 3 milliamps,
milliamp hours per average and
that should be okay. We have

00:52:17.034,00:52:22.906
extra batteries incase you know
you need them. And then one
little extra thing that was a

00:52:22.906,00:52:27.911
last minute Defcon exclusive um,
because we liked the art work in
China um this interactive

00:52:29.980,00:52:34.852
component we thought let’s add
some interactive component here
be- besides just the

00:52:34.852,00:52:40.691
communicating let's build some-
some crazy project and we had
Zebbler studios who’s done a lot

00:52:40.691,00:52:46.330
of cool um uh video mapping and
other stuff all around Defcon
that you see, oh yeah right

00:52:46.330,00:52:50.768
here, stuffs so cool when you
look at it and you’re like how
are they even doing that? And

00:52:50.768,00:52:53.637
it’s stuff that’s-that’s all
around Defcon that they’re doing
that again is one of those

00:52:53.637,00:52:58.642
things you don’t- you don’t even
consciously notice it’s just
like that’s awesome. Um, so

00:52:58.642,00:53:03.447
those guys are going to kill us
because a week before Defcon
we’re like oh by the way ha we

00:53:03.447,00:53:07.317
need some artwork and uh but
they pulled it off. I built a
little bit of hardware on the

00:53:07.317,00:53:12.489
left that would take the badge
and then process the data in an
easier way um for for David to

00:53:12.489,00:53:17.127
work on, one of the guys worked
on this project where it was
just an easier packet that went

00:53:17.127,00:53:21.999
into Raspberry Pi, and then he
basically created these packets
that would affect their video um

00:53:21.999,00:53:28.372
manipulation software which was
this resolume software and what
you end up seeing is this

00:53:28.372,00:53:31.708
display in the chill out lounge
you go there, you scan your
badge it’s going to show you

00:53:31.708,00:53:36.380
your progress it will show you
your badge type um and you know
you might get some crazy things

00:53:36.380,00:53:40.818
if there’s any bugs in the code
who knows what that’s gonna do
right? So, like hack on it, if

00:53:40.818,00:53:44.121
you change the firmware see what
it’s going to do, it's going to
make the Zebbler guys go crazy

00:53:44.121,00:53:48.659
um maybe you’ll break the
reader, like might as well try
it right it's Defcon [laughter].

00:53:48.659,00:53:54.932
Um, so there were a lot of
challenges I’m not going to go
into them all but what I really

00:53:54.932,00:53:59.570
learned um is that you know
every big project no matter how
big it is like you can actually

00:53:59.570,00:54:04.508
get through it in little chunks
and um just really exercise like
every aspect of my soul ha and

00:54:07.344,00:54:11.014
for engineering like it made me
a better engineer and it made me
a more confident engineer

00:54:11.014,00:54:15.452
because once you realize like
all problems you can find the
root cause and you can fix them

00:54:15.452,00:54:21.024
even though it might take a lot
of a lot of time. Lots of uses
for things if you you know want

00:54:21.024,00:54:27.264
to hack on your badge that’s
cool and this is where I have to
thank everybody because um you

00:54:27.264,00:54:32.402
know I’m standing up here giving
the talk but I don’t really
deserve the credit as much as

00:54:32.402,00:54:36.673
everybody else who backed it,
who supported me um because it
you know this stuff doesn’t

00:54:36.673,00:54:42.646
happen in a vacuum uh I’m just
the one who happens to-to- to
receive the thanks, but a lot of

00:54:42.646,00:54:47.885
other people should be thanked.
So, um, I do want to think um
NXP, of course the Defcon staff,

00:54:47.885,00:54:50.621
DT and Nikita for actually
listening to a lot of stuff
cause I couldn’t actually talk

00:54:50.621,00:54:56.126
to anybody for 6 months, um
Fusion EMS, Kingbrite who had
the LEDs, Altium and XP of

00:54:56.126,00:55:01.165
course cause they had huge
support. Um, Future electronics
and you know it’s a global

00:55:01.165,00:55:04.301
effort right? There is stuff all
over the world, I actually flew
to Belgium also to meet with

00:55:04.301,00:55:08.238
that team there, turns out one
guy did most of the code of that
team and it was like mind

00:55:08.238,00:55:13.810
boggling. So you know we are a
global community right and that
sounds sort of cheesy but it’s

00:55:13.810,00:55:19.883
actually true and like we
couldn’t get stuff done if it
was just alone in our room. So,

00:55:19.883,00:55:24.354
resources, this is it, final
slide, if you want to hack on
your badge go to the hardware

00:55:24.354,00:55:28.592
hacking village, if your badge
broke, if a connector fell off,
if a battery fell off, there’s

00:55:28.592,00:55:33.664
no better time than Defcon to
learn how to fix something. Um,
there’s a real life engineer

00:55:33.664,00:55:38.068
from NXP in the hardware hacking
village, actually he’s not there
yet, he’s here um guy named

00:55:38.068,00:55:43.073
Anthony, you should stand up so
[applause] he could help you
and-and so he could help you get

00:55:46.910,00:55:50.714
up and running, load the tools,
hack on it I’ll be around but
the intent really is to let you

00:55:50.714,00:55:54.885
guys go free and do this like
there’s no hidden puzzles that
you need me for. Right, like

00:55:54.885,00:55:59.723
just go out, enjoy Defcon have a
good time try stuff and thanks
again it’s really been an honor

00:55:59.723,00:56:01.658
and uh maybe I’ll see you next
year [applause].
