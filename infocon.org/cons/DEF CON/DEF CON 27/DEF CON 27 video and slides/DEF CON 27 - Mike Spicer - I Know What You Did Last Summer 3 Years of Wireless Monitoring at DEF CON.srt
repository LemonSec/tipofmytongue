00:00:00.100,00:00:06.473
>>You guys ready for this?
Everyone ready? [crowd cheers]
That’s what I like to hear.

00:00:06.473,00:00:10.811
[chuckles] So this is a uh a
little talk I’ve been putting
together and uh been working on

00:00:10.811,00:00:14.514
this for a little while. So
let’s start off with a little
bit about me. Um my name is

00:00:14.514,00:00:21.355
Mike, uh I’m also known as
d4rkm4tter. Um I consider myself
a mad scientist hacker uh who’s

00:00:21.355,00:00:26.426
particularly obsessed with
wireless, if you couldn’t figure
that out. Um I also love reverse

00:00:26.426,00:00:32.099
engineering, I love uh doing
wire- uh website pentesting. Um
just everything in this field I

00:00:32.099,00:00:37.004
l- absolutely love. Uh I’ve
created this project I’ve also
created another project called

00:00:37.004,00:00:42.009
the hashtag WiFiKraken. I’ll be
doing a demo lab, plug my demo
lab tomorrow at 10AM uh in uh

00:00:44.511,00:00:50.050
Planet Hollywood at the demo lab
so come check that out. Um also
I’m a Kismet cultist uh a Kismet

00:00:50.050,00:00:55.222
is the most amazing wireless
software for scanning. Uh also
recently I’ve become a runner.

00:00:55.222,00:01:00.027
So I love running and doing all
the running things. Alright
let’s talk a little bit about

00:01:00.027,00:01:06.500
the history and background. Um
in the early 2000’s uh we wanted
to get out and uh figure out

00:01:06.500,00:01:10.771
what’s uh what wireless networks
we could connect to because we
didn’t have internet service at

00:01:10.771,00:01:16.810
our home that was better than
like maybe jank DSL, right? So
we wanted to find better service

00:01:16.810,00:01:20.514
so we’re driving around trying
to get it so we could get all of
our sweet wares off of our RCF

00:01:20.514,00:01:26.420
serves and and Kazaas and stuff,
right? Uh [laughs] things have
changed a little bit now on the

00:01:26.420,00:01:31.391
ha- ha- almost all of us
probably have unlimited data
plans now on our 4g and

00:01:31.391,00:01:37.431
etcetera, right? So internet is
not that hard to find so why
would you want to start doing d-

00:01:37.431,00:01:42.436
wireless stuff? Well it started
for me in 2015 I had this idea
that I wanted to monitor uh all

00:01:45.138,00:01:50.744
of the WiFis at DEFCON. So a few
days before the conference I
took a single-board computer and

00:01:50.744,00:01:55.449
threw some wireless antennas on
it, put it in my backpack and
started hoofing my way around

00:01:55.449,00:01:58.852
DEFCON thinking “Yeah this is
gonna be amazing!” Well I
learned a lot from that. I

00:01:58.852,00:02:03.123
didn't catch very much data, I
learned a lot. And from that,
that led me to the project the

00:02:03.123,00:02:07.594
next- the following year and
that project was Project Lana
and what I was able to do is

00:02:07.594,00:02:12.699
deploy 12 boxes around the
conference sensor nodes that
were able to gather a bit more

00:02:12.699,00:02:18.672
data. Um and they were covering
2 point 4 5 gigahertz wireless.
Uh that project was sponsored

00:02:18.672,00:02:23.944
to- shout out to Warthog who
helped me uh secure the
equipment to be able to pull

00:02:23.944,00:02:28.648
that off. And then that led to,
I learned a lot from that
project, and that led to the

00:02:28.648,00:02:34.054
creation of the WiFiKrak- eh the
WiFiCactus. Uh the WiFiCactus
basically solved a problem that

00:02:34.054,00:02:39.459
I noticed with the previous
year’s project. Uh I only had 4
radios per box and I was missing

00:02:39.459,00:02:43.597
a lot of data, and I want to
catch it all, right? Cause you
gotta get all the data. Um and

00:02:43.597,00:02:48.602
so I was talking to Darren
Kitchen from Hak5 and I’m like
“Hey you know I had some

00:02:48.602,00:02:53.573
problems.” And he’s like “I
think I can help you with that.”
So he hooked me up with uh 25

00:02:53.573,00:02:59.146
PINEAPPLE Tetras and I was able
to pull off the cactus. Ok but
why though? Why, why would you

00:02:59.146,00:03:03.984
want to do this? Well the number
1 thing that I always would
typically hear is DEFCON’s

00:03:03.984,00:03:08.121
wireless network is the most
danger- well network in general,
is the most dangerous and crazy

00:03:08.121,00:03:13.126
network in the world. Um and I
wanted to know why. Like why is
it that way and how, right? So

00:03:15.462,00:03:20.067
what did I do? I decided to
build a thing once I built the
thing then I could start to

00:03:20.067,00:03:24.571
understand this and try to
figure it out. So another
interesting thing is uh we live

00:03:24.571,00:03:29.376
in a world where literally
everything is interconnected
now, right? So you’ve got like

00:03:29.376,00:03:35.215
smart fridges right? And you
probably have a smart toilet
too, right? So it comes to a

00:03:35.215,00:03:39.653
situation like maybe you haven't
pooped in a few days, uh maybe
your toilet will then tell your

00:03:39.653,00:03:43.990
fridge to order you some fiber
and next thing you know you’ve
got yourself, you’re- you’re

00:03:43.990,00:03:48.395
taken care of, right? And of
course those devices are
wireless right? Because it

00:03:48.395,00:03:53.633
wouldn’t make sense to connect
your toilet to your- to your
fridge with a wire. So anyways I

00:03:53.633,00:03:59.406
mean we’ve got idea- we’ve got
umm de- devices tons of devices
around us all the time uh that

00:03:59.406,00:04:03.143
are broadcasting. You probably
have multiple radios on you
right now. So I kind of think of

00:04:03.143,00:04:08.482
them as Pokemon, we gotta catch
‘em all, right? Uh and then the
other thing as hackers it’s

00:04:08.482,00:04:13.453
important for us to verify
trust, right? There’s a lot of
uh claims and you know

00:04:13.453,00:04:18.625
“Everything is secure! This VPN
will keep you you know super you
know I go through 7 proxies!”

00:04:18.625,00:04:22.329
type stuff and it’s like, but do
you really know that you know
you’re going to uh that your

00:04:22.329,00:04:28.602
data is not out in the clear. So
as hackers it’s important for us
to do that.Alright let’s talk a

00:04:28.602,00:04:34.274
little bit about the data. Umm
this this is a graph of the data
over the years of the- the

00:04:34.274,00:04:39.546
evolution of this project. And
as you can see it- it kind of
grew a little bit. Kind of got

00:04:39.546,00:04:46.453
bigger and bigger. Um the
interesting thing is like the
DEFCON 1 on 2018 2019 kind of

00:04:46.453,00:04:52.058
got a little small and the only
reason for that is because I ran
into a new problem is I kept

00:04:52.058,00:04:56.663
running out of storage space,
and so that would limit the
amount of time I could capture.

00:04:56.663,00:05:01.802
[laughs] Which was an entirely
new problem that I hadn’t ha-
ever experienced before. Um but

00:05:01.802,00:05:06.206
basically like you can just see
that year over year I’ve been
iterating and creating uh an

00:05:06.206,00:05:10.777
environment where I’m getting
more and more data. Creating
hardware making changes for

00:05:10.777,00:05:16.116
[laughs] thank you [laughs] uh
been so that’s how this is gonna
work. Ok good to know. Ummm I

00:05:16.116,00:05:22.522
love you guys. >>[offmic] We
love you too! >>Basically we
would you’re- we’re- I’m

00:05:22.522,00:05:25.458
creating a situation where I’m
just collecting more and more
data and figuring out the

00:05:25.458,00:05:30.630
bottlenecks and figuring out how
to do it. So when you have that
much data, um how do you do an

00:05:30.630,00:05:35.902
analys- an analysis on it. Um it
gets kind of rough, right? Uh I
don’t know how many have opened

00:05:35.902,00:05:40.907
up uh a 2 gig piche- uh 2 gig
file size PCAP in WireShark
before? Anybody? Couple of you?

00:05:43.910,00:05:48.782
Wh- what does that feel like?
It’s painful right? It hurts!
Like you’re just like “I want it

00:05:48.782,00:05:53.053
to query faster!” and it just
doesn't. And I mean it’s it’s
PCAPs are complicated, they

00:05:53.053,00:05:58.892
cover a lot of data. So um yeah
and then uh I use another tool
called Networkminer.

00:05:58.892,00:06:04.431
Networkminer uh the the creator
of that offered t- uh supported
me with a license because he

00:06:04.431,00:06:09.869
thought my research was kinda
cool. Um and that’s great for
data spot checking right? But if

00:06:09.869,00:06:13.940
you’re gonna thoroughly look
across your entire data set
that’s maybe not the best

00:06:13.940,00:06:19.045
solution. Uh and other tools
that I use, I use Kismet as I
talked about. Uh Kismet has a

00:06:19.045,00:06:24.351
wonderful WebUI that allows you
to search in real time, so
that’s great for like if I’m

00:06:24.351,00:06:27.887
trying to figure out what the
threats are in the environment,
what's going on right now in

00:06:27.887,00:06:34.294
real time I can pull that up.
Also, eh you can now load your
previous capture files into uh

00:06:34.294,00:06:38.498
uh a running session and then
from there you’ll be able to
then re play all that fun you

00:06:38.498,00:06:43.870
just had. Um and then the other
cool thing about Kismet is it’s
stored in SQLITE database. So

00:06:43.870,00:06:48.208
you can just imiediatly open it
up in your favorite SQLITE data
browser or even your Pyth- right

00:06:48.208,00:06:52.245
some Python scripts and start
scraping out some really
interesting data without getting

00:06:52.245,00:06:57.751
into you know processing PCAPs.
So and then I came to a point
where I’m like “All I wanna do

00:06:57.751,00:07:03.089
is I wanna run 1,000 instances
of tshark at the same time.” And
I couldn't find anything that

00:07:03.089,00:07:08.094
exists so I built a tool. Um
shoutout to elkentaro for making
this sick logo for me. Thank you

00:07:11.665,00:07:16.670
sir. Um so PCAPinator. Basically
it’s a tool that runs a ton of
tsharks at the same time. So

00:07:19.673,00:07:24.844
here’s the uh the help file for
it, um and it gives you some of
the base information. Uh right

00:07:24.844,00:07:30.183
now what it supports is it will
pull like DNS out, it’ll carve
it out, it’ll carve out uh

00:07:30.183,00:07:34.554
wireless information like all of
the MAC addresses involved in
commu- wireless communication,

00:07:34.554,00:07:39.793
the frame types, SSIDs, fun
stuff like that. It’ll also grab
handshakes and it will pull-

00:07:39.793,00:07:45.332
push it will convert them all
the way to HCX files so you can
dump em right into hashcat if

00:07:45.332,00:07:48.702
you’re down with cracking
passwords for some reason. I
don’t know why that would be

00:07:48.702,00:07:53.540
useful. Um and then also the
GitHub link is right there on
there and I’ll also have it at

00:07:53.540,00:07:58.111
the end of my slide. Uh that is
live right now, so I just opened
it up a little while ago. So you

00:07:58.111,00:08:02.082
can go get on that. Uh don’t
judge me harshly it’s still
really rough around the edges.

00:08:02.082,00:08:07.587
It’s the first like major
release of code into the wild so
uh yeah we’ll see how this goes.

00:08:07.587,00:08:12.592
YOLO. So this is just a quick
example of PCAP destroying my uh
96 core uh 48 core uh 48 lodge

00:08:17.664,00:08:22.669
er uh 96 logical core server. Um
yeah so it’s- it’s pretty
effective I’d say. Alright let’s

00:08:25.638,00:08:29.709
do a quick demo video. Ok so in
this demo video oopsies, see I
would have had the demo fail. So

00:08:29.709,00:08:34.714
in this demo video basically
what we’ve got is we’ve got a 2
point 5 gig PCAP file and on the

00:08:39.586,00:08:44.591
top we have just a single tshark
instance running and on the
bottom I’m running PCAPinator.

00:08:44.591,00:08:49.295
And so uh they’re running the
exact same query, basically I’m
just pulling out uh MAC address

00:08:49.295,00:08:54.234
and uh a bunch of wireless
information. And what this is
doing is it’s actually taking

00:08:54.234,00:09:00.673
the PCAP and it’s uh splitting
it into a bunch of uh individual
PCAP files and then it processes

00:09:00.673,00:09:05.678
each of those smaller PCAP files
uh on um uh on uh uh at the same
time. And so uh th- that file

00:09:08.681,00:09:13.887
took 5 minutes and 49 seconds to
process whereas traditional
tshark took 19 minutes. So

00:09:13.887,00:09:18.158
that’s significant and also
there’s still room for
improvement. I always leave like

00:09:18.158,00:09:21.961
you know things in my code so
that I can always make it better
and faster later. Cause you

00:09:21.961,00:09:26.966
don’t wanna, you don’t wanna do
your best work on the first
shot, right? Okie dokie.

00:09:30.670,00:09:35.675
Alright. So what did y’all do
last summer? Huh? Let’s get into
this shall we? First off let’s

00:09:38.545,00:09:43.883
let’s get to know ya a little
bit, shall we? So uh uh people
bring their devices to DEFCON

00:09:43.883,00:09:49.989
you know as you do. And those
devices are happy enough to
probe out you know things and

00:09:49.989,00:09:54.627
look for networks that y- they
wanna connect to and there’s
this wonderful website called

00:09:54.627,00:09:59.632
WiGLE dot net that you can then
cross reference those SSIDs to
and from there you can create a

00:10:02.368,00:10:08.541
map of where you’re from!
[audience cheers] And [laughs]
so the other interesting things

00:10:08.541,00:10:12.812
is on here, oh cool 10 minutes.
Um [laughs] the other cool thing
about this is uh you’ve got uh

00:10:12.812,00:10:17.817
uh uh- a lot of WPA 2s so I’m
really happy you guys are using
at your home networks and at

00:10:21.187,00:10:26.926
your work it looks like most of
you are using WPA2. However
Russia, I- there’s a lot of

00:10:26.926,00:10:31.431
unknown up there and I don’t
know what you’re doing, but I
want in on that action. I want

00:10:31.431,00:10:37.737
to get some more unknowns on
WiGLE. So if you know that
secret, let me know. Alright

00:10:37.737,00:10:42.075
let’s dive in a little bit now
to take this from a little bit
different of an angle uh this is

00:10:42.075,00:10:46.379
showing population throughout
the world where you’re coming
from. And so the larger the-

00:10:46.379,00:10:50.183
it’s a heat map so it, you know
the larger the dot the the
higher the place that you’re

00:10:50.183,00:10:55.955
coming from. So this was pretty
interesting to me too. I don’t
know what’s going on over there.

00:10:55.955,00:11:00.894
I believe that’s uh uh oh I just
forgot Baton Rouge I believe is
what that is. So I don’t know

00:11:00.894,00:11:04.664
what they’re doing over there.
But there’s either a lot of
people there or a lot of devices

00:11:04.664,00:11:10.770
or something’s happening there,
pretty interesting. Alright
let’s look at South America. The

00:11:10.770,00:11:15.375
1 thing on this 1 that was
really interesting to me is over
in Chile like you see that just

00:11:15.375,00:11:19.546
nice heat map all the side up
that Ch- uh on the side of Chile
over there. That was pretty

00:11:19.546,00:11:26.519
interesting. Alright let’s look
at uh let’s look at Europe now
and for me the most interesting

00:11:26.519,00:11:31.524
thing on here was the 1 in Iran.
Whoever’s WiGLEing in Iran in
Tabriz, dude shout out to you,

00:11:34.727,00:11:38.731
let’s keep it up, let’s WiGLE
all the things. We need every
place WiGLEd on earth, alright?

00:11:38.731,00:11:45.505
I need that- I need that to
happen for you guys. And now
we’re looking at Asia, you can

00:11:45.505,00:11:48.975
kind of see what’s going on
here. This is- it’s it’s crazy
you know we can kind of see

00:11:48.975,00:11:55.048
these heat maps and look at
where people are from. Ok
another thing that we can do too

00:11:55.048,00:11:59.619
is because I don’t just know the
SSIDs you’ve been beaconing, I
can know the MAC address of the

00:11:59.619,00:12:05.892
devices you’re beaconing or
probing or connecting to. So
your MAC address. And what can

00:12:05.892,00:12:09.596
you do with that, when you’ve
captured data at multiple
conferences? Uh thanks to this

00:12:09.596,00:12:15.234
tool called Graphestry uh I was
able to create this wonderful
graph and each tiny little dot

00:12:15.234,00:12:17.236
that you see on the screen there
is a MAC address of a device
that’s been at a conference. And

00:12:17.236,00:12:21.474
so this is the only filtering
that’s here is uh if it has been
at 2 or more conferences. So as

00:12:21.474,00:12:26.479
you can see there’s quite a big
flow over from Blackhat 17 to
DEFCON 25 which makes sense you

00:12:33.686,00:12:38.191
know. There’s pretty good
overflow from there, people come
over. Um and then there's oth-

00:12:38.191,00:12:45.031
some other small conferences, uh
Saintcon, ShmooCon, CactusCon
to- and DEFCON uh Defcamp uh to

00:12:45.031,00:12:50.503
say a few. Um and I mean and
it’s just interesting to see
these these groups, uh and then

00:12:50.503,00:12:54.907
the ones are most interesting
are the ones year to year. So we
can definitely see that DEFCON

00:12:54.907,00:13:00.513
has some retention uh [laughs]
from people coming back. I don’t
know why. Why- why do we keep

00:13:00.513,00:13:05.518
coming back? It’s amazing that’s
why. It’s amazing. Alright let’s
talk about wireless attacks.

00:13:09.455,00:13:14.460
They happen. We have wireless
attacks. Strange right? So uh
number 1 thing that I- I see and

00:13:16.496,00:13:21.501
it’s really noisy and it’s
really loud is deauthentication
attacks. And 1 thing that’s kind

00:13:21.501,00:13:23.503
of helpful is you randomize your
MAC and then when you randomized
your MAC address, you did it so

00:13:23.503,00:13:25.505
it’s an unknown OUI, an unknown
vendor. So basically what that’s
telling me is this is somebody

00:13:25.505,00:13:30.510
doing shady stuff so I’m gonna
keep track and try to then
figure out where you are and

00:13:38.084,00:13:42.855
triangulate and try to track you
and trilaterate and try to track
you down. Uh so maybe pro tip

00:13:42.855,00:13:48.461
for all of my red team fellows
in the audience, or f- f- not
fellows excuse me all you red

00:13:48.461,00:13:54.434
teamers in the audience, ummm,
uh uh go ahead and use like a
cisco OUI or something and

00:13:54.434,00:13:59.439
they’ll and someone will look at
it and be like “Oh my gosh,
you’ve got an AP that's

00:14:02.542,00:14:08.081
malfunctioning.” It’s not really
deauthenticating its an AP let’s
go track down this AP that’s

00:14:08.081,00:14:13.553
mis- that isn’t working
correctly. Uh [laughs] so the
other types of attacks that I

00:14:13.553,00:14:20.193
saw was there was a couple of um
uh what looked like KRACKS
attacks and KRACKS attack the

00:14:20.193,00:14:25.598
key reinstallation attack is- is
1 it’s really difficult to
identify by just passive

00:14:25.598,00:14:29.969
monitoring. So I am just
passively listening. I do not
connect, I do not make an active

00:14:29.969,00:14:33.573
connection with anyone. I’m just
sitting in the environment,
doesn’t even know that I’m here.

00:14:33.573,00:14:38.578
So um, you need more information
than that. But however based on
the fact that these are unknown

00:14:40.847,00:14:47.653
vendors, uh we know that
something really weird is
happening. Um and so that we

00:14:47.653,00:14:53.126
could go do more in- uh more
investigation into what’s going
on. Um and of course it’s DEFCON

00:14:53.126,00:14:57.997
so we’re gonna see you know
PINAPPLEs, Karma attack, uh Pine
AP, uh we’re gonna see man in

00:14:57.997,00:15:03.636
the middle stuff that’s going to
happen there. Um and what’s even
more awesome is when you leave

00:15:03.636,00:15:08.641
the MAC address as 0 1, or 0 0 1
3 3 7 uh you know because who
knows what that is, um and it-

00:15:11.477,00:15:15.481
there were at least 50 of those.
Now on the other side, let’s say
you wanna go freak out somebody

00:15:15.481,00:15:22.221
that’s got a wireless IDS uh you
might as well just start using
that OUI for everything. Uh

00:15:22.221,00:15:27.126
another thing too is people
really like to mess with SSIDs
for some reason. Wait wha- wha-

00:15:27.126,00:15:31.364
what number was that? Ok. Uh
they- they like to mess with the
SSIDs for some reason, they

00:15:31.364,00:15:36.502
throw in more data, and just
it’s- it’s crazy. So yeah
there’s a lot of things you can

00:15:36.502,00:15:41.407
look for in this data. Uh also
there’s a little bit of Wall of
Sheep action um [chuckles] most

00:15:41.407,00:15:47.313
of this I think is just super
trolly people trying to- trying
to uh do some clear text stuff

00:15:47.313,00:15:52.518
to be funny. I don’t think any
of this is like, legitimately
like Wall of Sheep um but uh

00:15:52.518,00:15:58.858
yeah it’s some pretty funny
stuff up there. Uh also there
were some data leaks uh you know

00:15:58.858,00:16:04.397
because sharing is caring. Uh
this is from a website called
Met dot NO. It looks to be some

00:16:04.397,00:16:07.667
sort of weather related, uh
could be an app, I’m not sure. I
couldn't find a lot of

00:16:07.667,00:16:12.271
information on it, uh but it
does leak uh your latitude and
longitude. So if this was

00:16:12.271,00:16:16.442
something that was given
privileged information for that
from your phone, um yeah- yeah

00:16:16.442,00:16:21.514
you- you just gave me your your
latitude and longitude. Thanks!
In a git request, uh completely

00:16:21.514,00:16:27.486
in the clear. Also the API is
it’s been upgraded, it’s been
upgraded to 2 point 0 as you see

00:16:27.486,00:16:32.625
at the bottom there. Uh still is
in the clear though. So
[audience laughs] uh and there’s

00:16:32.625,00:16:38.164
another 1 too. This 1 is uh accu
dash weather and this is a ZTE
desktop widget er excu- yeah

00:16:38.164,00:16:43.169
desktop widget from an Android
phone. So uh yeah what’s up with
these leaks on these APIs?

00:16:45.204,00:16:51.210
Another 1 I found was this is uh
an Alienware Bloatware. Um and
it- it contacts back to the

00:16:51.210,00:16:56.415
server with the uh serial
number, windows build, etcetera,
so uh thanks to you know Dell’s

00:16:56.415,00:17:01.721
support website, I was able to
find out that your warranty is
expired, so I’m sure they can

00:17:01.721,00:17:07.960
help you with that. [audience
laughs] Uh we also can see DNS
right cause DNS isn’t encrypted,

00:17:07.960,00:17:11.931
or if you are doing encrypted
DNS like you know more power to
you like awesome but how many

00:17:11.931,00:17:16.936
orgs are actually doing it. Um
so we know that people at least
wanted to go to these websites.

00:17:16.936,00:17:21.941
I don’t know if they did, I
don’t know what’s going on, but
they definitely tried. Um at

00:17:21.941,00:17:26.112
least looked it up. You know
there’s a couple on here, you
know finaid you know who’s gonna

00:17:26.112,00:17:29.682
come fill out their financial- I
mean this is a great place to
figure out your career, and what

00:17:29.682,00:17:33.786
you wanna do, but doing your
financial aid at DEFCON maybe
wait ‘til you get home for that

00:17:33.786,00:17:38.791
1. [crowd laughs][laughs] Also
Pornhub oooh. I know I know I
just go there for the stats too.

00:17:44.697,00:17:51.671
[crowd laughs] Oh another
wonderful thing is um yeah like
uh slack uses uh uh some uh sub

00:17:51.671,00:17:57.376
domains which is beautiful
right? So now I know all your
super secret slacks. And why

00:17:57.376,00:18:04.116
haven’t I been invited?
[audience laughs] Alright so
let’s talk about some of the

00:18:04.116,00:18:10.222
summary real quick here and wrap
this up. DEFCON is truly a
global community, we’re gonna

00:18:10.222,00:18:15.861
have DEAUTH’s uh it’s a protocol
level issue. We’ve got I mean-
we- we need stuff to happen to

00:18:15.861,00:18:20.866
get that better. PINEAPPLES are
a thing and they're gonna
happen. API’s are gonna leak.

00:18:23.269,00:18:28.274
[chuckles] DNS is DNS. For some
reason I don’t know why you guys
use Slack. Uh and also I just

00:18:30.977,00:18:34.780
wanna say you know don’t believe
the hype. Because that was 1 of
the things that I looked into

00:18:34.780,00:18:38.417
this the reason we brought this
out is like this is the most
dangerous, everything’s- you’re

00:18:38.417,00:18:41.988
owned as soon as you connect.
It’s like don’t believe the
hype, like use common sense.

00:18:41.988,00:18:46.425
Like don’t just connect to the
open wifi and then log in to
your bank, right? Umm. Use the

00:18:46.425,00:18:52.999
secured, there’s a secured for a
reason. There’s you know use
cell phone service uh uh

00:18:52.999,00:18:58.004
instead, not 3g not CDM main,
none of that. Make sure it’s 4g
or 5g uh which leads me to my

00:19:00.106,00:19:06.746
next asterisk. Um I don’t know-
I heard there was research being
presented on the LTE stuff. Uh

00:19:06.746,00:19:10.583
so [laughs] asterisk? I’ll get
back to you on that. Uh some
other points I want to just

00:19:10.583,00:19:14.987
point out on how to counter
measure and protect yourself.
Don’t auto- enable auto-connect.

00:19:14.987,00:19:19.859
Um I know phones now have the
ability to do geo fencing, so do
that so that that way you’re-

00:19:19.859,00:19:24.697
you’re- you can broadcast uh
only connect to the the
geofenced area where you’re

00:19:24.697,00:19:30.436
then- there. Also use VPN but
verify your VPN actually works,
uh the way you think it is. So

00:19:30.436,00:19:35.741
scan your traffic cause you
don’t want to be leaking out of
your VPN. Um I just wanna say

00:19:35.741,00:19:41.247
thank you to DEFCON and Hak5 and
Kismet, Saintcon, DC801,
Networkminer, Graphistry, these

00:19:41.247,00:19:44.583
uh and so many more, there’s so
many people even in this
audience that have that have

00:19:44.583,00:19:49.722
helped me and built me up and
made me, like, able to do this
to be here on this stage I’m so

00:19:49.722,00:19:54.226
thankful for that. And I
especially want to say thank-
thank you to every single 1 of

00:19:54.226,00:19:59.098
you because you know the the
likes on Twitter, the you know
the fact that you’re here like

00:19:59.098,00:20:04.103
it blows my mind. Thank you so

have been able to do this

00:20:13.712,00:20:17.550
project and to present it to you
and- and to see your guyses re-

00:20:17.550,00:20:20.319
thankful of that. And with that
I thank you. [audience applauds
and cheers]
