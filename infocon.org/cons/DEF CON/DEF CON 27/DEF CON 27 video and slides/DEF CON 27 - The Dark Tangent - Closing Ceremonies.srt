00:00:00.267,00:00:05.472
>>Thank you everyone, let’s see
who here by show of hands, this
is their first DefCon? Woo!

00:00:05.472,00:00:10.477
[applause] yeah. So I’m just
gonna kinda let you know what
you’re in for this will take an

00:00:19.152,00:00:24.124
hour to an hour and a half we’re
gonna kinda go through a whole
journey of back stories and what

00:00:24.124,00:00:29.129
it took to produce um things we
learned along the way what the
departments did and didn’t do um

00:00:31.131,00:00:37.204
and along the journey we’ll tell
you about uh transparency
report, plans for next year, um

00:00:37.204,00:00:42.509
and award the black badges so if
you haven’t been here before
that’s what you’re in for and if

00:00:42.509,00:00:48.248
you have been thanks for coming
back and this is like the
crowning achievement the final

00:00:48.248,00:00:52.352
sort of celebration for how
we’ve pulled it off after a year
of planning and so I just want

00:00:52.352,00:00:56.523
everybody to have a good time
and if you’ve got a beer, have a
drink with me

00:01:13.407,00:01:18.412
[applause][cheering] Where is
uh. Oh [laughter][audience
chatter] >>I’m sad too >>Yeah

00:01:35.762,00:01:40.767
>>I’d cry over that too
[audience chatter
continues][laughter] >>we should

00:01:54.648,00:01:59.653
go to slideshow [applause] >>I
like how the community just
delivers [laughter] A light beer

00:02:10.764,00:02:15.769
[laughter] >>Deal with this
>>okay go for the very first
one, that’s one, put that up.

00:02:23.076,00:02:28.081
[off mic chatter] Okay. F**k it
we’ll do it live [applause] So
there is one reality that I want

00:02:35.856,00:02:42.029
to confront with you upfront and
personal at the very beginning
of the closing ceremonies and

00:02:42.029,00:02:47.034
that is DefCon 27 is not DefCon
1 um we’ve grown quite a bit
over the years um I think

00:02:49.636,00:02:55.542
somebody who hasn’t a friend of
mine hadn’t come to DefCon since
DefCon 8 um and he was one of

00:02:55.542,00:03:02.049
the guys in the room when we
named DefCon and he was walking
around and he was like, you know

00:03:02.049,00:03:07.054
in this room we could fit DefCon
one two three four five six
seven in one room and he was

00:03:10.090,00:03:16.997
just amazed about how much we’ve
grown and how much the community
is uh diverse and so there’s so

00:03:16.997,00:03:20.734
many interests and he was trying
to say like in one room there
were people getting a ham

00:03:20.734,00:03:27.007
license and in the next room
they’re like teaching women how
to jimmy car doors open

00:03:27.007,00:03:29.876
[laughter] and he was trying to
explain it to his dad, his dad
who was used to be a police

00:03:29.876,00:03:34.214
officer and his dad’s brain just
couldn’t contain it [laughter]
just it didn’t like I don’t know

00:03:34.214,00:03:39.219
what you’re talking about son.
But along the last 27 years of
our growth um we’ve also

00:03:41.421,00:03:46.626
realized that we are aging and
as we bring in new generations
of hackers we’re starting to

00:03:46.626,00:03:51.631
lose the old generation of
hackers and [inaudible audience
shout] yeah, sucks. The first

00:03:55.135,00:04:00.006
person that figures out how to
stop aging I’m in line to buy
your secret. >>Black badge!

00:04:00.006,00:04:04.945
>>Yeah, bl- well that’s
Biohacking Village right? Get on
it guys! [applause] [laughter]

00:04:09.816,00:04:14.821
my knees are only going to last
so long um, so anyway I would
really appreciate it um if

00:04:18.492,00:04:23.497
everyone uh would raise your
badge and join me in a moment of
silence uh to remember our

00:04:26.266,00:04:31.538
friends who are, they’re just no
longer with us so just a moment
of silence for our fallen hacker

00:04:31.538,00:04:36.543
comrades and to respect them by
continuing to explore and hack
all of the things [inaudible

00:04:40.480,00:04:45.485
audience shouting] that’s not
quite silence but I’ll go with
it >>Woo! >>Yeah. Alright let’s

00:04:48.255,00:04:53.260
get this going we have two
people we wanna call out, our
first brother in arms Lockheed

00:04:55.462,00:04:59.833
who was instrumental in creating
the DefCon NOC and the
traditions and the

00:04:59.833,00:05:06.540
infrastructure and he was a
leader of DefCon NOC for over
twenty years um and though Lock

00:05:06.540,00:05:12.546
had retired he is still really
with us in spirit and he really
was a huge influence, nothing

00:05:12.546,00:05:18.852
phased him um he was unflappable
and friendly and it’s funny how
the tone of the conference is

00:05:18.852,00:05:25.625
really set in those early years
and he was really instrumental
in setting that. And also

00:05:25.625,00:05:30.831
unfortunately we lost uh Tuna.
Hugely contributory you don’t
see this because it’s behind the

00:05:30.831,00:05:35.835
scenes but he was on our uh CFP
review team and man he would
just grind out quality CFP

00:05:38.438,00:05:43.443
review so he had a large part to
do with the CFP selection and
same thing just his energy was

00:05:46.513,00:05:52.219
really incredible and so we just
wanna honor them by continuing
to grow and uh and make DefCon a

00:05:52.219,00:05:57.991
really welcoming place and
basically you know, honor their
contributions by tearing shit up

00:05:57.991,00:06:02.929
and uh looking forward. Thank
you [applause] I’m not, I’m not
crying, you’re crying! Oh man,

00:06:14.074,00:06:19.079
emotional. Yeah it’s allergies.
Alright. So. The badge. The
badge was the s*** I'd like to

00:06:26.853,00:06:32.459
introduce the creator the
designer of the badge Joe Grand
AKA Kingpin just like his badges

00:06:32.459,00:06:37.464
he’ll make your head spin
[applause] >>Thank you please no
applause [laughs] I can't move

00:06:43.103,00:06:47.807
around this is really awkward um
so you might have noticed that
you have a badge, most of you,

00:06:47.807,00:06:53.013
because we actually ran out we
made 26500 human which means we
had more than that at Defcon

00:06:53.013,00:06:57.450
this year we'd had a few
thousand inhuman but that's
crazy um how many of you guys

00:06:57.450,00:07:02.289
participated in the badge quest
sort of the challenge with the
badge? >>A lot! >>Woo! >>How

00:07:02.289,00:07:06.793
about over there in that
left-hand corner can you hear us
back there? Over the- hi! Okay

00:07:06.793,00:07:10.530
good, so you can. That’s like,
that’s a lot, that’s probably
what? Like 20 percent or

00:07:10.530,00:07:15.001
something like that’s, that’s
pretty cool. Um so I figure, I
figured I’d give a little bit of

00:07:15.001,00:07:20.974
detail um all the design details
are on the are on my website on
the DefCon Media Forum er uh

00:07:20.974,00:07:24.878
media server um but I just
wanted to clarify a few things
here, there’s a lot of rumors

00:07:24.878,00:07:28.348
and some of them were
intentionally placed I guess by
people playing the game [laughs]

00:07:28.348,00:07:33.887
uh but >>I like the one, so the
badges have a transmission range
of about a foot >>[laughs] oh

00:07:33.887,00:07:38.558
yeah >>but people are like, if I
turn it over backwards and I
hold my backwards to your

00:07:38.558,00:07:42.362
backwards, it's double secret
transmission [laughter] >>Or you
have to or you have to have to

00:07:42.362,00:07:45.532
kiss them together >>Oh, you
have to kiss them together and
then I saw a rumor on Twitter

00:07:45.532,00:07:52.038
that’s like no you have to
actually polish them [laughter]
>>So I will, I will dispel all

00:07:52.038,00:07:57.043
of those myths and rumors um the
technology we used NFMI is a
near-field magnetic induction

00:08:01.214,00:08:04.150
you don't have to hold them
together you can be probably
about a foot apart it’s pretty

00:08:04.150,00:08:09.155
cool uh very little if if any RF
signature um for the quest there
were seven different states and

00:08:11.558,00:08:18.098
the, the way that your LEDs are
flashing uh will show the state
and it actually spells out this

00:08:18.098,00:08:23.470
the different states as D E F C
O N in the lights you can figure
out what those mean or you can

00:08:23.470,00:08:27.574
look in the in the slides to to
see it um there's five magic
tokens so if you look at the

00:08:27.574,00:08:33.713
state uh at the state diagram oh
that’s me okay so now if you
look um we you know we start off

00:08:33.713,00:08:36.883
you can communicate with anybody
that brings you to the first
state then you have to find the

00:08:36.883,00:08:39.652
goons in the different areas so
you attend a talk you go to a
village, you go to the contest,

00:08:39.652,00:08:45.859
you go to a party, you go to an
art or entertainment exhibit you
find goons in those areas and

00:08:45.859,00:08:51.197
you scan the magic tokens which
don't look like normal badges
they have a different Stone on

00:08:51.197,00:08:56.770
them and that's how you can tell
that that goon has what you need
you can do those in any order

00:08:56.770,00:09:02.075
and then you progress to the
final state which which I call
State N and what you need there

00:09:02.075,00:09:06.479
is the group chat so you didn't
have to run around and talk to
anybody before that but it's

00:09:06.479,00:09:09.649
awesome that you did because I
know a lot of you met new
friends and stuff which is cool

00:09:09.649,00:09:13.520
um >>Where it’s at! >>Oh yeah
actually well I know a few
people tweeted me so let’s see

00:09:13.520,00:09:18.391
how many other people made new
friends by doing this contest or
the you know the quest?

00:09:18.391,00:09:25.198
[applause] >>WOO! >> that's a
lot of new friends yeah cool um
so the final one you have to get

00:09:25.198,00:09:30.804
one of every color gemstone not
every badge but every color
gemstone either all together or

00:09:30.804,00:09:36.576
or one by one I call that group
chat and when you do that, then
you win the game, you win the

00:09:36.576,00:09:40.914
quest >>What happened, what
happened? >>Well should I spoil
that, I wanted to check, like

00:09:40.914,00:09:46.619
should I spoil the the end,
yeah? Cause it's sort of over?
[applause] >>How many group chat

00:09:46.619,00:09:50.690
successes do we know of? >>Oh
good question. Yeah, who solved
the entire quest, who completed

00:09:50.690,00:09:56.362
the quest? Without without
cheating [laughter] no, well,
you know, well cheating counts,

00:09:56.362,00:10:02.202
it’s DefCon, cheating counts,
keep your hands back up. Oh god
okay [laughs] So that’s, that's

00:10:02.202,00:10:07.841
quite a few. All right so, when
you when you complete your quest
you get a little you get a

00:10:07.841,00:10:12.846
little Rick Roll right? We all
need a little Rick Astley in our
in our life and uh then the UR

00:10:12.846,00:10:15.949
interface that gives you a
command prompt and you can
interact with the badge gives

00:10:15.949,00:10:19.652
you some extra commands, some
art commands, and then some
things you can mess around with

00:10:19.652,00:10:23.690
the radio and troll other people
and stuff which I know some
people did um so anyway, that’s

00:10:23.690,00:10:29.629
that. The uber badge, I just
wanted to mention, these are uh
the same as the other types of

00:10:29.629,00:10:34.434
badges but they have a dyed
black quartz crystal with laser
engraving of serial numbers so

00:10:34.434,00:10:37.670
it may be slightly harder to
counterfeit even though I know
we saw some amazing counterfits

00:10:37.670,00:10:41.875
of these badges already uh and
the main thing is that these are
hackable for later so dont

00:10:41.875,00:10:46.412
forget that you know you have
one all of the documentation
again is available you can write

00:10:46.412,00:10:49.849
your own code you can do
something cool do some covert
communication do something or

00:10:49.849,00:10:53.152
hang it on your wall but it
doesn’t have to you know go on
ebay or go in the trash or

00:10:53.152,00:10:57.390
anything like you could still do
something with it um I did want
to mention a few crazy hacks so

00:10:57.390,00:11:00.727
people right away started
dumping the code off of these
things, patching the code to

00:11:00.727,00:11:04.597
skip through states without even
knowing anything abou tthe
communication method just like

00:11:04.597,00:11:09.269
sticking it into Ghidra and
reverse engineering it which is
pretty cool uh somebody wrote

00:11:09.269,00:11:13.473
some code they call it the
jackpot code that they could
just hold up to any badge and it

00:11:13.473,00:11:17.877
would just unlcock everything
which is cool super cool way to
just like it’s like in Mario you

00:11:17.877,00:11:21.447
go through the pipe and you come
out and your done like that’s
pretty cool [laughter] um how

00:11:21.447,00:11:25.752
many of you how many of you guys
looked at the interactive
artwork in the chillout lounge?

00:11:25.752,00:11:30.623
Where you could scan your badge?
Yeah, there was a lot of people
in line so it must have just

00:11:30.623,00:11:35.161
been you guys the whole time
like cycling through [laughter]
um so this this uh was like a

00:11:35.161,00:11:38.431
last minute thing that we
thought, it would be cool if we
could scan our badge and see the

00:11:38.431,00:11:42.435
state of the badge see how
you’re doing in the in the event
>>I mean, by last minute, it

00:11:42.435,00:11:47.807
means it was being built >>Yeah
>>Two days in advance >>Yeah it
was like Thursday, >>Yeah >>We

00:11:47.807,00:11:52.045
finished it Thursday and the
main people behind that I have
to shout out to uh to Zebbler uh

00:11:52.045,00:11:56.849
and David Dolan who work behind
the scenes to do all the crazy
video mapping stuff and this was

00:11:56.849,00:12:00.787
thrown at them and it was it was
not good and I’m glad I actually
got to meet them because they

00:12:00.787,00:12:06.359
turned out to be really nice but
I know they didn’t like me
[laughter] you know over email.

00:12:06.359,00:12:12.131
I apologized profus- profusely
um so I do wanna say too we
tried a lot of new things right

00:12:12.131,00:12:16.569
we decided to use these new
lanyard straps to mount things
um we learned a lot about kind

00:12:16.569,00:12:22.642
of the humnan condition human
nature and uh we were sort of
curious if you learned anything

00:12:22.642,00:12:26.446
at DefCon related to the badge
or not right because DefCon’s
all about learning we tried new

00:12:26.446,00:12:29.916
things some of them maybe worked
out a litle better than others
like some antennaes fell off but

00:12:29.916,00:12:34.187
you coud go repair those um but
that’s part of the process for
us as well as you, you know

00:12:34.187,00:12:38.491
we’re trying new things so I’m
curious like did anyone learn
anything new at DefCon? >>Yeah!

00:12:38.491,00:12:44.764
[cheering] >>Woo! >>Probably
everyone that’s that’s pretty
good cool um okay so with that I

00:12:44.764,00:12:49.836
wanna say that all of the
enthusiasm around the the badge
quest, the excitement, people

00:12:49.836,00:12:54.907
coming up asking questions
posting pictures tweeting
whatever seeing groups of people

00:12:54.907,00:12:59.379
working together was really just
to me it was amazing and it was
contageous to kind of see that

00:12:59.379,00:13:03.549
excitement uh and none of that
would have been possible without
all of the goons that helped do

00:13:03.549,00:13:08.121
the quest uh everyone behind the
scenes and of course all of you
that played so thank you for

00:13:08.121,00:13:14.227
that and uh I’m looking forward
to seeing what next year will
bring so [applause] >>[off mic]

00:13:14.227,00:13:19.232
oh wait ask them about >>Oh
[applause] Okay okay I’m still
here [laughs] DT wanted me to

00:13:23.936,00:13:29.442
ask you what you thought of this
like new attempt of adding some
soft you know jewelry to your to

00:13:29.442,00:13:33.546
your wardrobe for DefCon, did
you like the gemstone?
[applause][cheering] Wow >>It

00:13:33.546,00:13:39.986
was really uh we didn’t know
what we didn’t know what people
would make of it it was a big

00:13:39.986,00:13:44.857
roll of the dice we’re like
we’re kind of moving it up the
stack here on your lanyard and

00:13:44.857,00:13:49.929
we weren’t quite sure if people
wanted like that hard crazy
circuit board techno or if we

00:13:49.929,00:13:54.667
could go the you know you can
see it but you’re not quite sure
what’s going on. >>Yeah but it’s

00:13:54.667,00:13:59.272
also pretty cool to see thirty
twenty eight thousand something
hackers all wearing gymstones

00:13:59.272,00:14:03.876
>>Yeah that’s pretty crasy
>>That’s pretty cool >>Ha! We
got you >>You can go by your

00:14:03.876,00:14:08.881
local new age store and be like
check this out, hand cut
brazilian quartz crystal

00:14:13.753,00:14:18.291
[laughter] >>Yeah >>Alright,
thanks again [applause] >>Okay
so we’re gonna start going

00:14:18.291,00:14:22.128

you’re gonna get a quick report
on what’s been happening, what

>>[laughs] Cardi B >>Um so uh

00:14:52.592,00:14:58.064
bear with me a moment I’m going
to do a little strong Brittney
moment um I wanted to start off

00:14:58.064,00:15:03.002
by saying a few things about uh
Tuna um on June 29th the
community lost someone that

00:15:05.271,00:15:11.410
truly embodied the word hacker
uh King Tuna, Terrance Gareau,
he hacked everything he was a

00:15:11.410,00:15:16.883
huge contributor to the CFP
board, he wanted to make the
world more secure, he lived

00:15:16.883,00:15:21.587
every minute of his thirty three
lives exactly the way he wanted
everyone that met him loved him

00:15:21.587,00:15:26.592
he was a son, a brother, an
uncle, a husband, and a hacker
he was infuriating and

00:15:28.594,00:15:32.799
endearing, he was honest, and he
was shady, and he was a true
friend, and we’ll miss Terry

00:15:32.799,00:15:37.804
every day, so thank you
[applause] Alright, strong
Brittney [laughs] Um we had 26

00:15:47.313,00:15:53.820
CFP mem- review members um
reviewing for six months we
started about in January uh more

00:15:53.820,00:16:00.092
than five hundred submissions we
had a ten percent increase for
those who um marked themselves

00:16:00.092,00:16:05.097
identifying as female on the
applications [cheering] Seventy
seventy five percent are new

00:16:10.970,00:16:15.975
speakers to DefCon we really
like to encourage that in our
community [applause] um just

00:16:19.312,00:16:24.317
slightly over forty five percent
released um tools and exploits
and um we hope that you

00:16:29.388,00:16:34.393
appreciate our talks and if you
have any um feedback to feedback
at talks at DefCon dot org

00:16:41.033,00:16:46.105
[whispering off mic] yes or

do mess up and we do appreciate
the feedback and we hear it we

00:17:43.496,00:17:48.501
did hear complaints about the
unofficial DC101 uh noob panel
this year and um I wanted to say

00:17:51.070,00:17:56.075
we heard you, we are sorry and
we will do better next time so
thank you all [applause] and uh

00:18:02.715,00:18:07.720
have a good day. >>Okay
workshops this is our third year
of workshops and a record year

00:18:10.957,00:18:16.896
for us um because we got to
basically take over a lot of the
space at the Flamingo so where

00:18:16.896,00:18:21.901
is where’s the workshops?
Workshops, who is representing
us for workshops [off mic

00:18:24.470,00:18:30.710
chatter] here I am hello
[laughter] what are you doing?
>>Every year we’re like, we

00:18:30.710,00:18:35.715
don’t know if we’re going to be
on stage [laughter] >>Yes >>Yes
>>Yes >>You will be on stage >>

00:18:38.384,00:18:43.389
okay hi everyone um I am Megan
Totenkoff I’m the department
lead for workshops uh how many

00:18:46.592,00:18:51.597
of you all were able to get into
a workshop this year? Ugh okay
that happens every, like the

00:18:54.367,00:18:59.372
second time I’ve done this and
I’m like, okay sorry [laughs]
how many of you attempted to get

00:19:01.640,00:19:07.747
into a workshop this year?
>>Ooooh >>Okay so a little bit
of background, this is our fifth

00:19:07.747,00:19:12.752
year doing workshops at DefCon
or at, sorry, fifth year me
running workshops at DefCon um

00:19:15.688,00:19:20.693
we started out with maybe twenty
sessions that could hold maybe
fifty to sixty people and this

00:19:23.329,00:19:28.334
year we have thirty sec, thirty
six sessions and we could hold
between eighty and ninety people

00:19:30.469,00:19:35.741
depending on the room so we’re
trying to get more folks in and
also we are coming up with a

00:19:35.741,00:19:42.615
better solution than the free
for all that is the one day for
Eventbright reg. So we did sell

00:19:42.615,00:19:49.221
out in less than one minute this
year, we had a little bit of a
hiccup, but we worked with

00:19:49.221,00:19:54.226
Eventbrite to fix it, we had
nearly two thousand attendees
attend workshops this year, with

00:19:56.295,00:20:02.601
fifty five instructors, we had
more women and underrepresented
minorities this year in

00:20:02.601,00:20:07.606
attendance as well as teaching
so that was really cool to see
[applause][cheering] and our

00:20:12.978,00:20:18.884
submissions also doubled over
last year so if you ever are
interested in teaching a four

00:20:18.884,00:20:24.657
hour workshop keep an eye out
for the call for workshops and
submit early and submit often.

00:20:24.657,00:20:29.662
Thank you. [applause] >>Okay I
don’t know if uh is Mel? No. Oh
you’re gonna do it? No? Okay, no

00:20:42.508,00:20:47.513
not that Mel, the other Mel, the
Mel that runs press um alright
so I’m gonna cover her slides so

00:20:50.950,00:20:55.254
apparent- this year we had
approximately a hundred and
twenty media organizations

00:20:55.254,00:21:00.192
represented at DefCon, twenty
percent were new to us uh from
twelve different countries and

00:21:03.629,00:21:09.135
in the end we ended up having to
ban one of them for uh code of
conduct privacy violations so

00:21:09.135,00:21:14.140
it’s never fun kicking them out
but [applause][cheering] the big
new the big new change you might

00:21:18.911,00:21:24.183
have noticed it was kind of a
drama thing for the press
department um but I don’t know

00:21:24.183,00:21:29.755
if it ever really boiled over
into the public was this year we
changed the camera policy and in

00:21:29.755,00:21:35.728
the past the issue was you would
have one say camera crew from uh
a big morning TV show but it

00:21:35.728,00:21:40.332
wasn’t like one guy you would
get the personality or the
talent, you’d get the producer,

00:21:40.332,00:21:43.969
you’d get the cameraman, you’d
get the soundman, you’d get the
lighting guy, and you’d have

00:21:43.969,00:21:49.775
five or six people to do one
camera shot and we started
looking at all the media that

00:21:49.775,00:21:54.580
that produced, the coverage of
the show and we looked at it and
we said is that any different or

00:21:54.580,00:22:01.487
better or worse than what we’re
getting? And we realized it was
actually worse. Um the the short

00:22:01.487,00:22:06.692
camera snippets were not that
positive for us and so we
decided you know what how about

00:22:06.692,00:22:11.463
just you don’t get to have a
camera crew anymore uh you’re
not clogging up the hallways

00:22:11.463,00:22:16.001
with five people uh and you’re
not doing the sweeping audience
shots [applause][laughs] and so

00:22:23.175,00:22:27.413
we spent a lot of time uh
holding the hands explaining
like you can bring your iphone

00:22:27.413,00:22:31.550
you can bring a hand camera but
you don’t get to bring a camera
crew and you know you can do

00:22:31.550,00:22:35.621
offsite shooting you can shoot
somewhere else, that’s fine, we
can help you find a place but

00:22:35.621,00:22:41.126
you just can’t do it in the
middle of, say the vendor area,
and cause a problem. And it led

00:22:41.126,00:22:47.499
to these really weird
interactions where uh, what do
you mean? Um don’t you want

00:22:47.499,00:22:52.972
coverage, don’t you want us?
Like, we’re the press.
[laughter] And we’d be like,

00:22:52.972,00:22:59.144
yeah but but you came to us
like, we didn’t go to you. And
they’re just, their heads don’t

00:22:59.144,00:23:04.950
compute, that’s not how it works
in that world so they’re like
but but but. So anyway I think

00:23:04.950,00:23:09.488
the press uh adapted to that
really well I think so far some
of the coverage has been

00:23:09.488,00:23:14.193
fantastic and we actually
tweeted out one example of how
this policy really led to some

00:23:14.193,00:23:18.764
really uh creative but uh
positive coverage of our
community so we’re gonna stick

00:23:18.764,00:23:23.769
with that in the next year and
see uh, see how that goes
[applause] So I want to uh I

00:23:26.805,00:23:32.077
want to thank the whole press
team, they deal with hundreds of
submissions and tons of

00:23:32.077,00:23:35.981
questions and the other thing
that was new this year was an
outgrowth of press is we had a

00:23:35.981,00:23:41.453
policy group so if you were
interested in policy we had a
subgroup that dealt with nothing

00:23:41.453,00:23:46.992
but people, representatives,
staffers, uh industry, who were
interested in policy and we had

00:23:46.992,00:23:53.032
a miniature sort of invite only
policy track for representatives
and we’ve never done that before

00:23:53.032,00:23:57.269
and that worked out really
really well so we’re probably
going to continue that and try

00:23:57.269,00:24:02.207
to work with policy folks to get
them on side and explain our
world to them [applause] Demo

00:24:06.545,00:24:11.550
labs, demo labs, I’m not doing
two in a row guys [laughter] who
is doing demo labs? Where is he?

00:24:16.455,00:24:22.294
>>I’ll do it >>You’ll do it
>>Woo! Grifter! >>Captain
America! [applause] >>We just

00:24:22.294,00:24:28.334
talked to okay >>Man, when he
said f**k it we’ll do it live,
he meant it [laughter] Like I

00:24:28.334,00:24:31.770
where where are all the goons?
>>Where did they go? >>They’re
swimming >>Is there a secret

00:24:31.770,00:24:36.775
goon party like on the roof?
[laughter] >>They’re at the pool
on the roof! [inaudible off mic

00:24:41.347,00:24:44.783
shouting] [laughter] >>So um so
we’ve been the dem- demo labs
for a few years now um we just

00:24:44.783,00:24:50.489
wanted to have a platform for
people to show off the tools
that they’re creating um we

00:24:50.489,00:24:55.327
asked that they be open source
um or community based uh we
don’t want to shell somebody’s

00:24:55.327,00:25:01.500
product so uh we get a great
number of submissions on that.
It also gives the folks who

00:25:01.500,00:25:08.374
submitted a talk that um that
may have only covered a tool um
somewhere to if they’re not

00:25:08.374,00:25:12.544
selected for the main stage, to
have somewhere to show it off uh
and then it gives them a

00:25:12.544,00:25:19.284
significant amount of time to do
plenty of demos um but we had
nearly forty demo labs this year

00:25:19.284,00:25:24.289
um running six at a time and uh
I mean, they were just full all
the time everybody was in there

00:25:26.325,00:25:31.697
um yeah did anybody go see a
demo lab? I know we were in, we
were in Planet Hollywood which

00:25:31.697,00:25:36.702
meant we were on like basically
another planet but >>Hey
[laughter] >>Um bud-um-ch! No?

00:25:38.704,00:25:44.510
D**n it guys [laughter][sighs]
Alright so, yeah, so a hundred
and fifty hours, nearly a

00:25:44.510,00:25:49.114
hundred and fifty hours of demos
uh it went really really well if
you have a tool, work on a

00:25:49.114,00:25:53.285
project, or you’re thinking
about doing something please
consider submitting to the demo

00:25:53.285,00:25:58.290
labs next year we’d love to see
uh what you’ve got to bring to
the table [applause] >>It’s you,

00:26:03.295,00:26:08.300
support line. It’s either, it’s
either Aida or CJ okay it’s CJ.
[applause] >>Every year. Every

00:26:25.117,00:26:30.122
year Defcon gets bigger and
every year we get more and more
interesting things going on and

00:26:32.157,00:26:37.196
we tried to respond to that by
adapting and the help line was
one of the areas we tried to

00:26:37.196,00:26:41.633
adapt in. We know there are
members of the community that
need help and we figured this

00:26:41.633,00:26:46.638
was a good way to work and the
stats here show that it is doing
good and we would like feedback

00:26:49.074,00:26:55.914
on how we can do better so total
twenty nine calls came in during
Con there were twelve code of

00:26:55.914,00:27:00.252
conduct reports pushed through,
all of which will be
investigated, all of which will

00:27:00.252,00:27:07.059
be acted on. There were five
referrals to trained
para-professional counselors,

00:27:07.059,00:27:12.064
one legal issue, and one person
trapped back of house [laughter]
>>Yeah so what what we expect to

00:27:18.604,00:27:24.810
happen is as the community as
people get comfortable using
these mechanisms what we’re

00:27:24.810,00:27:29.114
trying to do is be really
transparent here because if you
see we’re doing something you’re

00:27:29.114,00:27:34.887
more likely to use the system
and trust the system and so we
expect numbers to increase every

00:27:34.887,00:27:41.560
year not necessarily because
we’re getting worse but because
people are getting um confident

00:27:41.560,00:27:47.232
in the system and so I’m hoping
in two or three years we’ll have
reached our steady state um

00:27:47.232,00:27:51.336
where everybody feels that uh
you know their complaints are
taken seriously and we have

00:27:51.336,00:27:56.208
mechanisms to to help you out so
you know sometimes when I see
numbers if they go up I actually

00:27:56.208,00:28:01.146
get excited because that means
the systems being used uh and
it’s working. [applause] >>So

00:28:09.288,00:28:13.492
some of the stuff that would
normally go in the transparency
report I just read out from the

00:28:13.492,00:28:18.330
helpline because we’re moving
things across people feel more
comfortable when reporting

00:28:18.330,00:28:22.668
through that mechanism so you
may see some things change some
things aren’t on the report that

00:28:22.668,00:28:27.673
were on there before um this is
now the second year of having a
full formal transparency report

00:28:30.275,00:28:37.182
and as Jeff just mentioned, the
numbers are bigger, but in some
ways uh the numbers are better.

00:28:37.182,00:28:42.187
So we had six reports of
harassment, five medical
incidents and a medical inci-

00:28:45.791,00:28:50.562
incident is something where we
have to call paramedics or or
some more to come and deal with

00:28:50.562,00:28:55.567
it, uh two reports of theft
slash loss, three people were
banned and trespassed from the

00:29:00.272,00:29:05.277
property. We had two pieces of
ceiling falling down this year
[laughter] which [applause]

00:29:12.985,00:29:17.990
which is a hundred percent
increase on last year >>Yeah
fifty yeah >>[laughs] We foiled

00:29:23.362,00:29:29.201
two attacks on the casino this
year, not just one, so we’re
getting better at some things

00:29:29.201,00:29:34.206
[cheering] we we narrowly
avoided one biblical grasshopper
plague [applause][laughter] we

00:29:42.180,00:29:47.152
issued two warnings to our
staff, so to be clear, our staff
are held at a high level of

00:29:47.152,00:29:52.157
standard. If you have an issue
with our staff, report it, they
will be dealt with, there is no

00:29:54.526,00:29:59.531
room for goons that don’t
respect the community [applause]
Following on from that we fired

00:30:10.308,00:30:15.313
a staff member this year who did
not respect the community he was
trespassed from the property and

00:30:17.716,00:30:22.721
banned for life [applause] we’re
[laughter] that’s kind of an odd
thing to clap like it’s sad but

00:30:26.825,00:30:31.830
uh but it’s you know it shows,
nobody’s above the law, at the
end of the day, we all follow

00:30:36.802,00:30:41.807
the same policies. We had five
complaints of drunken [laughter]
I’m not going there >>It’s good

00:30:45.944,00:30:50.949
to be the king >>We had five
reports of drunk and disorderly,
we had five photo policy

00:30:55.520,00:31:01.893
complaints and I saw a lot of
traffic about this on twitter um
we do take these very seriously.

00:31:01.893,00:31:06.732
Melanie and her department
worked really hard to make sure
that press follow the rules and

00:31:06.732,00:31:12.571
we also make sure that attendees
follow the rules. If people are
violating the policy, tell us,

00:31:12.571,00:31:17.109
if you feel uncomfortable with
what someone is doing with a
camera, tell us and we will do

00:31:17.109,00:31:22.114
something about it. One media
company was ejected because they
couldn't follow the rules

00:31:30.689,00:31:36.228
[applause] We had eleven reports
of safety or security issues
relating to the hotel and then

00:31:36.228,00:31:41.233
the last one is somewhat of an
embarrassment um we sort of
failed at a troll attempt at uh

00:31:44.469,00:31:49.474
giving out a black badge raffle
[laughter] while in some regards
it was funny I think a lot of

00:31:51.610,00:31:56.615
people were disappointed by it
and that’s not really the the
go- the best outcome and so we

00:32:01.019,00:32:06.024
apologize for that we will try
to troll harder but safer
[laughter][applause] When you

00:32:16.067,00:32:22.507
consider the increase of
attendees we have here these
numbers both represent more

00:32:22.507,00:32:28.180
people coming forward and
talking about issues but also
there is not a step change

00:32:28.180,00:32:33.185
increase in problems, that’s
great. You guys did sure keep me
busy all Con and I’ve been

00:32:35.453,00:32:40.458
running around like crazy but it
actually has probably been one
of the safest cons I’ve attended

00:32:42.561,00:32:49.000
and I would actually like to
give a shout out to the Caesar’s
security folks who helped us

00:32:49.000,00:32:54.005
with numerous incidents and who
also were so understanding that
hackers will be hackers and as a

00:32:58.276,00:33:04.816
result many of you played with
things, maybe crossed a few
lines but if it wasn’t anything

00:33:04.816,00:33:11.089
malicious you’ll have noticed
nothing bad happened and that’s
because Caesar’s understands,

00:33:11.089,00:33:16.094
and for that, I thank them.
[applause] >>Okay so how many of
you have installed the Hacker

00:33:29.307,00:33:35.313
Tracker tool? >>Woo! >>Woo!
Fantastic. Um that last
announcement about the black

00:33:35.313,00:33:40.318
badge, don’t don’t listen to
that announcement that was a
mistake [laughs] that was a

00:33:42.988,00:33:47.993
[laughs]. Anyway >>You mean the
raffle is on? >>The raffle is
on! [laughter] That’s right.

00:33:54.933,00:33:58.870
Okay, do we have uh somebody
from the info booth who would
like to talk about their

00:33:58.870,00:34:03.808
project? It’s us again, where’s
info booth? You’ve got it! It’s
little, Little Bruiser from info

00:34:06.678,00:34:11.683
booth. >>Thank you >>Thank you.
So Hacker Tracker is the
official DefCon app uh the

00:34:15.720,00:34:20.725
development team is part of info
booth so if you’ve installed it
we had about seventy five

00:34:22.894,00:34:28.600
hundred Android downloads over
Con and uh iOS I don’t have
specific numbers but it’s

00:34:28.600,00:34:34.272
relatively close to that as
well, so a lot of people are
skeptical to download the app

00:34:34.272,00:34:39.277
because it’s called Hacker
Tracker [laughter] uh rightfully
so. But no it it’s really good

00:34:42.180,00:34:47.185
uh it gives all of the schedule
and we even had the raffle talk
on it for a brief period of time

00:34:50.388,00:34:56.895
[laughs] so we also apologize
for that because you know we
kind of overstepped so [Jeff

00:34:56.895,00:35:00.265
Moss laughs] No but I just
wanted to think info booth team
uh all the great work they’ve

00:35:00.265,00:35:06.871
done and you know you how many
of you actually visited a booth
in one of the several properties

00:35:06.871,00:35:12.611
this time? That’s great, you
guys always come and ask great
questions and we appreciate it

00:35:12.611,00:35:17.749
and as I said in the in the
program we really do know where
all the restroom are located

00:35:17.749,00:35:22.754
>>You also feed in to the DC TV,
right? >>Uh yes, that’s very- uh
no we don’t do the DC TV but the

00:35:24.756,00:35:30.261
info dot defcon dot org is run
with the same platform as the
Hacker Tracker app so what we

00:35:30.261,00:35:35.200
were displaying at every booth
is the same information that’s
displayed on the apps so we have

00:35:35.200,00:35:40.205
the integrated back end with
that with DTs help getting us
caught up there >>Cool cool >>So

00:35:43.174,00:35:48.179
yeah >>Right on >>Cool, thank
you [applause] >>Alright one of
the big parts of DefCon is the

00:35:52.884,00:35:57.889
network and to talk about it we
have Louise. [applause] >>Thanks
DT, hello everyone um I have

00:36:06.598,00:36:13.071
problems with like podium mics I
feel like Ricky Bobby, hello can
you hear me? So if you don’t

00:36:13.071,00:36:17.809
hear me I I will eat the mic.
Thanks everyone for being here.
I’m going to go through the

00:36:17.809,00:36:23.915
usual NOC stats and what we do
and not and stuff like that. If
you didn’t notice [laughter] uh

00:36:23.915,00:36:29.621
last year we had a theme that
was Guy Fieri this year we
changed a little bit as to it

00:36:29.621,00:36:34.626
was Nicolas Cage uh so if you
that that was a transformation
thing for us but anyhow um we I

00:36:40.131,00:36:44.602
recycled the slides from last
year totally uh because it’s
very similar what we do the

00:36:44.602,00:36:50.308
difference is that because of
the number of properties we
arrived here, or Mac who is the

00:36:50.308,00:36:55.313
other lead for for the NOC he
arrived here on Thursday, two
weeks ago almost, or twelve days

00:36:58.116,00:37:03.822
ago, um to start working on this
but pretty much Friday Saturday
do all of the back of the house,

00:37:03.822,00:37:09.260
IDFs, MDFs, connection between
the all all of the hotels, I’m
not going to bore you and read

00:37:09.260,00:37:14.432
all about it we’re gonna post
the this later you can go
through green is when we’re

00:37:14.432,00:37:21.172
happy and red is kind of like a
little touchy uh but some of the
highlights there is that we got

00:37:21.172,00:37:26.177
most of the stuff running by
Sunday like the core, and IDFs,
mostly important WIFI reg uh was

00:37:29.114,00:37:34.119
up by Sunday night which was a
record record record time, do
not expect that next year just

00:37:36.421,00:37:41.426
in case [laughter] uh but it was
uh we’ll get there, how many
people used it? I think it was

00:37:43.895,00:37:49.134
about uh two thousand registered
but a lot of people also used
DefCon DefCon which is the

00:37:49.134,00:37:54.606
default and there is no problem
with that, I’m going to explain
that a little bit later uh but

00:37:54.606,00:37:59.511
yeah it was up, right? But it’s
funny I land here on Saturday
because I’m lazy and Mac has

00:37:59.511,00:38:04.449
been here since uh Thursday and
I check in and people are like
is WIFI reg up? I’m like not

00:38:06.484,00:38:11.990
quite yet but we’re gonna get
there, but it worked out okay uh
but you can go through kind of

00:38:11.990,00:38:17.996
like our timelines um again
green we were happy uh at night
we were drinking the finest

00:38:17.996,00:38:23.868
drink of Chicago which is called
Malort if you haven’t you should
try it or not >>You were

00:38:23.868,00:38:30.508
drinking miller lites >>Exactly,
how to in fran uh in fran uh a
person in uh how to impress a

00:38:30.508,00:38:35.513
friend in person that that’s a
shot of Malort. Anyhow um so we
work mostly here in Paris NOC

00:38:38.116,00:38:43.087
was here in Paris we did Paris
Bally’s and then Planet
Hollywood and Flamingo um other

00:38:43.087,00:38:48.092
highlights here we have the call
for services this year um I I
bet we can do that better next

00:38:51.462,00:38:57.235
year but everytime we change a
little bit it’s it’s tough on us
on planning and execution

00:38:57.235,00:39:02.173
meaning everything um and
highlights oh so Wednesday was
the day that everybody’s kind of

00:39:05.243,00:39:09.714
here and they’re like remember
that thing I asked you, I need
it right now. We tried to

00:39:09.714,00:39:16.054
accommodate and prioritize.
Thursday is the day of remember
that thing I forgot to ask you,

00:39:16.054,00:39:21.059
I need it right now so we got it
done. Uh by Friday everything
was okay uh Saturday was a busy

00:39:24.495,00:39:29.500
day um most of the stuff worked,
some workshops we had to tear
down bring stuff back to the

00:39:31.603,00:39:36.608
NOC, we had our NOC talk, if you
attended I hope you enjoyed. We
went a little deeper on what we

00:39:38.610,00:39:43.615
are talking here and later on
one, of our team members did
drunk hacker history he did not

00:39:45.683,00:39:52.156
win but he did well um they are
tearing down right now, that’s
why I’m here, they are working,

00:39:52.156,00:39:57.161
so big hand for those guys who
are doing the hard work please
[applause] Thank you. And

00:40:03.901,00:40:08.239
tomorrow and Tuesday we have
some some people staying through
Tuesday just to make sure

00:40:08.239,00:40:13.244
everything goes to the right
place and then we go to like a
month detox or something like

00:40:15.313,00:40:20.018
that [laughter] so some of you
ask us like what do you find
when you’re like patching cables

00:40:20.018,00:40:24.255
and things like that? So that’s
one of the pockets in one of the
hotels you can find a little bit

00:40:24.255,00:40:30.528
of everything there [laughter]
um one has a fork, and the other
one has the quesadilla

00:40:30.528,00:40:35.533
[laughter] so I think the person
saved some food for later, might
have been Nic Cage, I don’t

00:40:37.802,00:40:42.807
know. Bandwidth wise, usually
it’s a big issue for us this
time around it wasn’t, thank you

00:40:44.909,00:40:49.914
DT and Linda. Um [applause] that
means use more next year and
then I’ll bug him but yeah we

00:40:53.217,00:40:58.323
had nine hundred megabits per
second for the first time which
is more than double that we had

00:40:58.323,00:41:03.261
last year um and you guys did
well so thank you for that. Uh
some other stats I think the

00:41:05.596,00:41:10.601
most important here is the one
on the bottom left, is it? Yes.
So yellow is the DefCon secure

00:41:14.372,00:41:19.377
network so about ninety percent
if not more of you used the
secure wifi network with eight

00:41:23.314,00:41:28.319
802.1x and wpa2 enterprise uh a
few like ten percent or less is
the open wifi so big shout on

00:41:32.223,00:41:38.629
that for you guys [applause] so
cool I hope it worked out okay I
know it could be spotty in

00:41:38.629,00:41:44.936
places but we tried to cover the
whole thing but not the casino
um very important somebody sent

00:41:44.936,00:41:51.042
us a tweet saying this is not
your is like wifi down? I’m like
what’s the location and they’re

00:41:51.042,00:41:55.680
like well we’re by at Bally’s by
the elevators I’m like yeah it
kind of like doesn’t work there

00:41:55.680,00:42:00.618
it’s casino area we are not
allowed to be there. Challenges,
timing right? the bigger we get

00:42:03.888,00:42:09.093
more pro- not bigger bigger is
not the problem but more
properties cause like bring more

00:42:09.093,00:42:15.733
complexity uh to the whole thing
but everything worked out pretty
okay, uh it’s just like when

00:42:15.733,00:42:20.104
we’re here in the NOC and it’s
like oh an AP went down in
Flamingo like somebody’s like

00:42:20.104,00:42:25.109
I’ll go, and they go, not me
[laughter] So thanks to the team
again um and what did go well?

00:42:29.180,00:42:33.985
This is a first slide for this
year, well uh obviously I have
an awesome team uh great

00:42:33.985,00:42:39.657
interaction with all the
departments I know I I could be
a pain in the a*s to ask people

00:42:39.657,00:42:44.695
like for stuff way before hand
just because we have to
coordinate with the hotel to to

00:42:44.695,00:42:51.135
get patches and for them to be
prepared to cater what we need
uh so I appreciate that for

00:42:51.135,00:42:56.574
those that sent stuff on time,
for those that didn’t, I also
appreciate you because sometimes

00:42:56.574,00:43:01.512
we just know stuff if after like
everything’s going on right? But
we sort of plan for that. Um

00:43:03.981,00:43:10.888
802.1x is also like uh the way
to use secure wifi is also
sometimes a challenge for us

00:43:10.888,00:43:16.694
because people don’t understand,
and you technically really don’t
have to, but uh we’re trying

00:43:16.694,00:43:20.865
like along for the past few
years we’ve been trying to make
it easier and easier for you so

00:43:20.865,00:43:25.870
was the the Apple profile uh
this year CRV Colin in the NOC
he went out of his way and he

00:43:28.773,00:43:34.011
created the Android app that way
you don’t get super freaked out
when like you’re downloading a

00:43:34.011,00:43:39.116
cert and it says oh we’re gonna
read your stuff! No we don’t do
that it’s just like a warning

00:43:39.116,00:43:45.556
that uh Android has so that’s a
way to kind of like bundle that
in a way that is verifiable and

00:43:45.556,00:43:52.530
trusted. >>Was integrated into
the hacker tracker app for
Android and it was all automatic

00:43:52.530,00:43:54.532
>>There we go [applause] making
it easy for you guys, right? And
also on Sunday when I was like,

00:43:54.532,00:43:59.537
is wifi reg up, is wi- wifi reg
up? Like yeah it’s up just like
good times and then somebody

00:44:06.043,00:44:11.048
says it doesn’t work on Chrome-
on Chromebooks. So I had C75 and
Jo- and John in the NOC that

00:44:13.851,00:44:18.256
they spent probably the whole
night and a little bit of the
morning saying we’re gonna make

00:44:18.256,00:44:23.227
this work because we couldn’t
find anywhere on the internet
how to without having an MDM

00:44:23.227,00:44:28.499
solution to make this work they
went out of their ways, their
way, and made that work so big

00:44:28.499,00:44:33.504
props to these three guys
[applause] So pretty much we
laid the network for everything

00:44:36.874,00:44:42.246
that is being used here that
uses IP, no we don’t have IPV6
yet that was a question that we

00:44:42.246,00:44:47.552
had cause there is no way that
we can block uh router
advertisements and things like

00:44:47.552,00:44:52.690
that that I don’t know because
it’s been awhile and I’m just a
manager. Um we have a ten gig

00:44:52.690,00:44:57.795
backbone, nine hundred megabits
per second uplink, again we
didn’t use it all, now he’s not

00:44:57.795,00:45:02.700
going to give you more, use it
next year, right? [DT Laughs]
Let’s max that out. Uh there’s a

00:45:02.700,00:45:09.540
layer two connection to from
Paris to Planet Hollywood, core
is in Planet Hollywood uh and

00:45:09.540,00:45:14.545
IPSec tunnel to Flamingo, this
is the gear that we used, you
can read later um the numbers

00:45:17.081,00:45:22.086
that you like uh a lot of
traffic, twelve terabits,
terabytes per second total as of

00:45:24.755,00:45:31.162
like one pm today um lots of big
numbers there uh you can go
through that uh interesting

00:45:31.162,00:45:36.167
points here are uh a little less
of wireless users than last year
uh and a little bit less of uh

00:45:41.205,00:45:46.310
different mac addresses so
thanks for stop spoofing or
creating like random mac

00:45:46.310,00:45:52.817
addresses just to try to mess
with things. Um little more
traffic uh compared to last year

00:45:52.817,00:45:58.222
on the media server that you can
download stuff at certain points
in time we saw a lot of people

00:45:58.222,00:46:04.462
downloading a bunch of stuff
like who is this user so that
was kind of cool um I want to

00:46:04.462,00:46:10.368
think the NOC team, I know I did
that, but please another hand
for these guys it’s, they’re

00:46:10.368,00:46:15.373
awesome [applause] and thanks to
everyone here, uh DT, he listens
to a lot of stuff that I have to

00:46:22.780,00:46:28.552
complain uh sometimes he avoids
me but that’s okay that’s what
bosses, good bosses, sometimes

00:46:28.552,00:46:33.557
do uh Nikita for getting us on
the right track uh on everything
but pretty much the NOC location

00:46:35.726,00:46:40.531
and our talk yesterday that was
well received. Linda for
accommodating everything from

00:46:40.531,00:46:45.603
trash cans in the NOC to
everything else, Will for
getting what we need, QM for

00:46:45.603,00:46:50.975
delivering stuff on time
Caesar’s IT and Encore, these
guys are rockstars for us,

00:46:50.975,00:46:57.748
without them we couldn’t do
stuff on time at all, um Sully’s
bar staff for keeping us on

00:46:57.748,00:47:04.221
track, the high l- high roller
at the LINQ was fun, twenty
eight minutes of drinks uh year

00:47:04.221,00:47:10.961
it breaks you on Sunday. Um the
usual guys who brings a couple
of snacks they’ve worked before

00:47:10.961,00:47:15.766
at a at a call center before and
stuff so they appreciate what we
do, I know a bunch of you do and

00:47:15.766,00:47:21.572
that’s greatly appreciated uh
the other departments were doing
the things that I asked them to

00:47:21.572,00:47:26.577
do sometimes on time so
appreciate that. You but mostly
important, Lock who was our lead

00:47:30.614,00:47:35.619
and um and integrity,
accountability, professionalism,
working here for you guys and

00:47:43.027,00:47:48.032

cameras here and the feeds over
here, they provide all the video

across the strip here so twenty
six channels across seven hotels
this year so all of the hotels

00:49:21.192,00:49:26.197
are part of the DefCon hotel
block uh a whole lot of IPSec
tunnels and internet and things

00:49:28.432,00:49:35.239
to make that happen uh our team
wound up making twenty two
visits to these various hotels

00:49:35.239,00:49:40.244
to get things hooked up um and
you know thanks to step counters
uh the aggregate across the team

00:49:42.813,00:49:49.253
was a hundred and sixty eight
miles of walking and pounding
pavement through back hallways

00:49:49.253,00:49:54.258
of hotels, running past security
uh etcetera. Um. >>Much like the
NOC if you tweet us, we will

00:49:59.763,00:50:06.437
respond uh >>and and you’re and
you’re quick to let us know if
something goes wrong [laughter]

00:50:06.437,00:50:13.277
>>Which can be a blessing or a
curse. >>So these were the seven
hotels we were in, it was about

00:50:13.277,00:50:18.282
thirty thousand television sets
um we had two streams to the
internet track uh one DC101 on

00:50:21.485,00:50:27.024
Thursday, uh track four for the
rest of it. We actually had over
ten thousand views of the

00:50:27.024,00:50:32.196
internet streams so for the
people who are not able to be
here with us in person, they

00:50:32.196,00:50:36.500
were here in spirit. >>And we
did get a number of tweets of
people saying hey thank you for

00:50:36.500,00:50:40.504
doing this, thanks for having
the the tracks up on the
internet cause I couldn’t be

00:50:40.504,00:50:47.144
there this year because of X Y
or Z so that was, that was
great. >>So Video and myself,

00:51:58.449,00:52:03.420
uh he couldn’t make it to DefCon
China but he was still involved
in all of the villages for

00:52:03.420,00:52:07.558
DefCon China so we couldn’t
thank him there so we’re going
to double thank him here, thank

00:52:07.558,00:52:12.563
you man. [applause] >>I’m still
just trying to figure out why
I’m here, somebody told me there

00:52:18.902,00:52:23.907
was free tequila [laughter]
>>There is >>DT did you hear a
rumor? Villages need more space,

00:52:26.310,00:52:30.814
just saying >>[DT laughs] that’s
what I’ve heard >>Alright so
real quick you may have noticed

00:52:30.814,00:52:36.420
that we have some villages
around the Con, there was thirty
two in total, eleven of them

00:52:36.420,00:52:41.425
were new, uh, let me know what
you thought at villages dot
DefCon dot org. Other than that

00:52:43.527,00:52:47.731
I would just like to thank all
the village leads for all of the
work they do to help me make my

00:52:47.731,00:52:53.070
job easier and then I would like
to thank all of my village goons
for all they did to make it

00:52:53.070,00:52:58.075
easier for you guys to get
around with a special shoutout
to uh Fox, RunnerUp, Hownie, and

00:53:01.245,00:53:06.250
Amazarkn for attempting to keep
me on task [laughter] Other than
that uh that’s about all I got.

00:53:10.220,00:53:14.158
Let me know what you think , I
hope you enjoyed the villages
and learned a little bit, I know

00:53:14.158,00:53:19.163
we’re trying to grow em all like
I said, but thanks for coming
[applause] >>Okay we’ve got a

00:53:26.103,00:53:32.176
little bit of some statistics,
we’ve got Data Duplication
Village, are they packing up?

00:53:32.176,00:53:37.915
DDV? Okay so this is something
that we started years ago um it
was originally sources from the

00:53:37.915,00:53:42.920
info con dot org uh video
archive uh something I do with
all my spare time [laughs] Uh I

00:53:46.056,00:53:51.128
collect all the videos I can
find from every hacker
conference um and then we also

00:53:51.128,00:53:55.732
have some old hash tables,
rainbow tables and some word
lists and other things um so

00:53:55.732,00:54:01.038
here are statistics. This year
we managed to dupe over five
hundred six terabyte hard

00:54:01.038,00:54:07.010
drives, which is a lot, um and
you can see over here on the
right hand side info con is

00:54:07.010,00:54:11.381
about half, two hundred and
thirty copies, people like
getting new uh updates of

00:54:11.381,00:54:16.186
different cons but I’m really
surprised people still really
like their rainbow tables but I

00:54:16.186,00:54:21.091
can understand downloading five
terabytes each, that takes
awhile, a lot of people in other

00:54:21.091,00:54:25.963
countries don’t have that kind
of bandwidth or time uh or maybe
they’re on a metered connection

00:54:25.963,00:54:30.701
and so it’s really cool that we
make it possible for people to
grab data really quickly what

00:54:30.701,00:54:35.272
I’d love to see in the future is
more datasets and more people
bringing their own datasets like

00:54:35.272,00:54:39.943
it would have been really cool
um to see some other big dumps
there uh so maybe in the future

00:54:39.943,00:54:44.748
we’re gonna try to make that
easier for people to bring and
contribute their own data. So um

00:54:44.748,00:54:51.622
by a show of hands who here, any
of the five hundred people,
participate in the Data

00:54:51.622,00:54:56.660
Duplication Village? Okay, back
there. Um all these the rainbow
tables weren’t on the con

00:54:56.660,00:55:01.765
network but all the info con
data every year is on the con
network so if you don’t want to

00:55:01.765,00:55:06.770
bring a hard drive you can
always run with W get. Alright
we’re gonna grow that next year.

00:55:09.973,00:55:14.978
Next up we’ve got vendors. Who
wants to represent vendors, come
on down, dun dun dun [applause]

00:55:24.321,00:55:29.326
>>Hi DefCon, I’m Kevin >>Hi
Kevin! >>I’m the team lead for
uh for vendors and uh I wanna

00:55:32.196,00:55:36.500
talk a little bit about uh the
vendors themselves so this is a
list of the vendors that we did

00:55:36.500,00:55:43.273
have and uh we really love
having smaller companies come in
and sell their products, the

00:55:43.273,00:55:47.644
type of products you wanna buy
from, you know, the mom and pop
shops or the you know not the

00:55:47.644,00:55:51.715
Amazons of the world
essentially, uh you know we love
those types of vendors so who

00:55:51.715,00:55:56.720
here actually bought something
from vendors? [cheers] Yeah. We
had a lot of people buy things

00:55:59.289,00:56:02.125
from vendors, and that’s really
awesome, I know that they
appreciate it, we loved having

00:56:02.125,00:56:06.396
you guys in there, our vendor
goons um we really appreciate
them, big shout out to all of

00:56:06.396,00:56:10.901
them for helping the vendors get
setup and helping you guys find
your way um I think the big

00:56:10.901,00:56:15.906
thing that I wanna say is that
if you have any feedback for us
as as the attendees or if you

00:56:18.442,00:56:22.813

like to see inside of our
vendors areas please let us

know, you can get ahold of us at
uh vendors at defcon dot org.
Shoot us an email, give us any

00:56:27.017,00:56:31.421

01:00:58.455,01:01:03.393
events >>Uh oh Uh oh! That’s
right, breathe it in. Uh so as
you can see there’s uh there’s

01:01:12.335,01:01:18.608
quite a few uh contests and
events that are on this slide uh
there’s also some random ones

01:01:18.608,01:01:25.015
that that grow organically
throughout the conference uh
sometimes they become uh you

01:01:25.015,01:01:30.620
know official contests later
yeah there is dino sumo
wrestling but that’s unofficial

01:01:30.620,01:01:36.760
and has been unofficial for
several years we’ll we’ll work
on it it’s fine. Um so yeah, if

01:01:36.760,01:01:41.998
you um let me see, how many
people participated in a contest
or event out here? Anyone?

01:01:41.998,01:01:47.003
>>Woo! [applause] >>Alright
awesome, so um I guess first and
foremost um I’d like to thank

01:01:50.073,01:01:55.579
the organisers of of these
contests uh they put in a
significant amount of time I

01:01:55.579,01:02:01.551
mean they start emailing me uh
whether I like it or not uh in
January about what they’re going

01:02:01.551,01:02:07.357
to do uh the coming year and
it’s an incredible amount of
effort just to make sure that

01:02:07.357,01:02:12.362
you guys are entertained so
thank you very much to them
[applause] Um also I’d like to

01:02:16.266,01:02:21.271
thank the contest and event
goons uh we have an incredibly
difficult job of sitting on a

01:02:25.875,01:02:31.848
couch in the contest area and
watching the contests take place
it’s hard, somebody's gotta do

01:02:31.848,01:02:36.853
it, so it’s us, so thanks guys
[applause] Alright if you are
interested in running uh an

01:02:42.926,01:02:48.031
event or a contest please reach
out to me, if you’ve got some
crazy idea that you think is

01:02:48.031,01:02:54.371
just way too weird, we’ll never
do it um we might just do it so
please hit us up contests at

01:02:54.371,01:02:59.376
defcon dot org or hit me up on
the twitters uh grifter801 um
and we’ll see what we can make

01:03:03.179,01:03:08.184
happen but let’s get to uh the
black badges alright so
[cheering] so of all of the

01:03:14.090,01:03:19.095
contests you saw on that slide,
only nine of those contests
actually receive black badges so

01:03:21.197,01:03:27.404
it’s incredibly stiff
competition, what we look for in
a black badge contest is first

01:03:27.404,01:03:34.110
and foremost difficulty right?
We want you to work for it if
you’re getting into DefCon free

01:03:34.110,01:03:39.115
for life, you better bring it.
And so we want something that’s
gonna make you uh suffer or at

01:03:41.451,01:03:48.291
least eat up a fair amount of
your weekend just crushing
puzzles or uh putting together a

01:03:48.291,01:03:53.296
ridiculous pretext and just
coming at it full force so uh
this first contest I’m going to

01:03:56.232,01:04:01.171
bring to the stage is one of the
longer running contests, they
are near and dear to my heart, I

01:04:03.606,01:04:08.411
think they are near and dear to
yours, the room when this
contest is taking place is

01:04:11.014,01:04:16.019
packed, they put in >>Grifter I
love you! >>I love you too
[laughter] I do um so um again

01:04:21.591,01:04:25.962
they put in a significant amount
of effort they’re uh they’re one
of those contests that’s

01:04:25.962,01:04:32.235
planning all year they’re
celebrating their tenth year
this year, welcome to the stage,

01:04:32.235,01:04:37.240
the social engineering contest
[applause] [cheering] >>So ten
years that’s unbelievable huh?

01:04:46.549,01:04:51.921
Um this year we had eleven
thousand square feet and we
still broke fire code by putting

01:04:51.921,01:04:56.893
people over the floors so yeah
it was a little crazy >>And the
ceiling >>and the ceiling yeah

01:04:56.893,01:05:02.031
so the two ceiling tiles that
fell that statistic, that was
our room and and one of them

01:05:02.031,01:05:07.337
this is not even a joke uh they
had tried to repair the ceiling
and they left a razor utility

01:05:07.337,01:05:12.876
knife in the ceiling and it fell
through the ceiling tile and cut
one of our one of our people in

01:05:12.876,01:05:18.581
our room >>Did they deserve it?
>>[laughs] what? No! I don’t
think she deserved it she was

01:05:18.581,01:05:23.686
just standing there looking at a
t-shirt and then had a knife run
down the back of her arm anyhow

01:05:23.686,01:05:28.491
so that was pretty that was
pretty crazy yeah yeah that that
actually happened, uh real

01:05:28.491,01:05:34.764
stores. Um also the the kids and
teams events I know uh they’re
that’s not the black the black

01:05:34.764,01:05:39.369
badge portion of it but there
was just something notable I
wanted to to tell the community,

01:05:39.369,01:05:45.575
we had a young man who lost his
mother last year right before
DefCon and uh he he came and he

01:05:45.575,01:05:50.980
competed in the teams event and
he said just for the three days
he’s here running around he

01:05:50.980,01:05:56.319
forgets about losing his mom
because of the community and the
way you guys accepted him and

01:05:56.319,01:06:01.157
make him feel so that’s a young
little uh fourteen year old
young man that’s coming to

01:06:01.157,01:06:06.062
DefCon and finding a place to
really express himself so just
wanted to say thank you to all

01:06:06.062,01:06:11.067
of you that interacted that way,
so thank you [applause] Okay, so
on to the events just a couple

01:06:18.408,01:06:23.880
stats that are shocking to me
this year um our contestants we
had fourteen contestants they

01:06:23.880,01:06:29.853
spent eight hundred and seventy
four hours doing osent um the
three weeks before they hand

01:06:29.853,01:06:35.592
their reports in and we had one
thousand one hundred and twenty
pages of osent submitted. I just

01:06:35.592,01:06:39.529
don’t think they understand I
also have a life and we just do
this for fun [laughs] but that’s

01:06:39.529,01:06:46.069
a lot of osent to read um we had
the first time ever in ten years
of running this contest that the

01:06:46.069,01:06:52.942
uh a contestant got a perfect
score on the report right? And
uh [applause] Yeah, yeah, I

01:06:52.942,01:06:57.947
didn’t think it was possible um
especially this year we chose
our theme was alcohol, tobacco,

01:07:00.016,01:07:05.855
and fire arm companies, in
America we thought it would be
fitting and um the first day man

01:07:05.855,01:07:10.193
the fire arm companies were
shutting us down non stop it was
like literally like bang bang

01:07:10.193,01:07:14.464
you’re dead and uh [laughter]
see what I did there, see what I
did there? I’m here all weekend

01:07:14.464,01:07:19.602
um >>I appreciate that >>Yeah
you appreciate that, I know, we
have the same sense of humor. So

01:07:19.602,01:07:23.339
um but then the second day it
wasn’t the case but we had the
best the best thing that

01:07:23.339,01:07:29.212
happened uh out of all of all of
the calls was this one uh
contestant was using a pretext

01:07:29.212,01:07:35.084
uh what was the name he was
using Ro- Robert Green and he
and he got caught like someone

01:07:35.084,01:07:39.989
really got suspicious after
giving over like flag flag flag
flag and he call- he hung up,

01:07:39.989,01:07:45.194
called another uh part of the
the company and he said this is
Rob Green from IT and the lady

01:07:45.194,01:07:51.334
says Rob Green?! You’re a d**n
liar! Click! And just [laughter]
so so yeah I gotta say here’s

01:07:51.334,01:07:55.705
what I’m really proud of that
that means that company actually
had an email policy where they

01:07:55.705,01:08:01.644
warned all the othr employees
about scam calls that’s awesome
right? [applause] It took us ten

01:08:01.644,01:08:06.649
years to get there! It took us
ten years, that’s that’s
phenomenal so I’m really happy.

01:08:08.751,01:08:14.290
Okay so without without wasting
anymore time is this the first
time there’s a baby on stage at

01:08:14.290,01:08:17.694
DefCon? >>I think mine was on
stage >>Oh yours was on okay I
was just curious, I was just

01:08:17.694,01:08:22.699

place winner, first time she
ever did anything like this she

01:08:38.481,01:08:42.752
just started off like three
months ago or something in the
industry, sadly she had to leave

01:08:42.752,01:08:46.222
for a flight, she was flying
back to Australia and didn’t
want to be late so she had to

01:08:46.222,01:08:51.227
run but uh she she came in uh
second place with the perfect
report score um also with an

01:08:53.296,01:08:59.369
unbelievable call score but uh
our first place winner, Alleef

01:08:59.369,01:09:05.541

women dominated the competition
uh we again have two women in

01:10:02.932,01:10:07.970

competition were all by our our
women SEs so good good job keep
it coming, thank you! [applause]

01:10:30.626,01:10:35.732

another long running contest uh
the it’s it’s funny that the

01:10:35.732,01:10:40.736
first two are the ones who start
to hit me up in January um this
is uh a contest that has taken

01:10:43.339,01:10:48.344
many forms over the years it
started out as a troll
essentially right? Uh And it

01:10:48.344,01:10:55.118
morphed into something
incredible uh so it went from
grabbing your uh your creds and

01:10:55.118,01:11:01.157
putting them on a wall on a
paper plate in the Alexis Park
turned into capture the packet

01:11:01.157,01:11:06.162
[applause] >>Woo! Woo! >>Sup
DefCon, I’m Riverside, how’s it
going? Uh so this year we uh we

01:11:12.635,01:11:17.640
did uh two Packet Hacking
Villages for DefCon, one in
China and one here but uh in

01:11:17.640,01:11:22.044
China it’s actually the data
Packet Hacking Village because
Packet Hacking Village by itself

01:11:22.044,01:11:28.184
means purse hacking village um
cause the translation’s so
awesome but um I wanna really

01:11:28.184,01:11:33.055
really thank DefCon this year
because the space was awesome um
how many of you got a chance to

01:11:33.055,01:11:39.295
go out to the village?
[applause] Alright, how many of
you got shirts? Alright, there

01:11:39.295,01:11:44.500
were six thousand shirts given
out this year it was awesome we
really really uh had a great

01:11:44.500,01:11:50.072
time so I just thanks again to
DefCon I wanna thank all of our
staff our volunteers our

01:11:50.072,01:11:55.978
speakers and the DJs it was
rocking uh we got shut down on
Youtube streaming multiple times

01:11:55.978,01:12:00.917
for violations by accident on
the DJs oops uh [laughs] but um
uh we I wanna sneak by some some

01:12:05.254,01:12:11.527
very very short time in here I
know I gotta get off the stage
soon um we have amazing people

01:12:11.527,01:12:17.433
across all of DefCon and this is
an inclusive community and we we
accept everyone and some of our

01:12:17.433,01:12:22.738
community have disabilities um
both physical, mental, we have
people of all different shapes

01:12:22.738,01:12:28.544
and sizes and we include ev-
absolutely everybody so in at
least in our village we started

01:12:28.544,01:12:33.683
building a tag for those that
want to wear them that’s a
disability tag that is bright

01:12:33.683,01:12:39.255
and like that people can see it
so if somebody has social
anxiety, panic attacks, you can

01:12:39.255,01:12:42.925
see and you’re like okay let’s
get that person help. There’s
goons all over the place but

01:12:42.925,01:12:49.632
sometimes in a crowd there is a
thing. We ask that the crowd,
the group, not use social

01:12:49.632,01:12:53.636
engineering techniques and use
those, if you see it, it’s
legit. Please try, I know we’ve

01:12:53.636,01:12:57.340
talked to DefCon, they’re
working on trying to figure out
something, those that want to

01:12:57.340,01:13:02.278
can, those that can’t can’t but
um you know we have but you know
a ton of different people and we

01:13:02.278,01:13:06.949
wanna make sure everybody can
participate equally so let’s
let’s work that together as a

01:13:06.949,01:13:11.954
community [applause] thank you.
So this year’s wall of sheep
stuff was a bit sparse because

01:13:18.294,01:13:24.333
you know we’re getting the open
not the secure network but um
what we did notice and we kind

01:13:24.333,01:13:28.204
of pivoted completely we build
some of you noticed a second
projector next to the wall we

01:13:28.204,01:13:33.542
call that the si- sidecar app um
since we can’t see your
encrypted credentials meaning

01:13:33.542,01:13:38.381
we’re actually doing our legit
dob what we can see is your
awesome DNS tracking records and

01:13:38.381,01:13:44.186
all the other things. How many
of you by show of hands knows
what an HTTP tracker is? Okay,

01:13:44.186,01:13:49.859
so, not many. That means a
company is tracking everything
that you do and so we had a flow

01:13:49.859,01:13:54.964
of all the traffic going across
the network and fifty percent
plus of the DefCon attendees at

01:13:54.964,01:14:00.069
any given time were being
tracked by another company.
>>How much porn?! >>A lot, a lot

01:14:00.069,01:14:03.706
of porn [laughter] but all those
trackers, we were tracking the
trackers, and watching who wh-

01:14:03.706,01:14:08.010
who was doing what it was
awesome to watch, so even though
they’re not a bunch of stuff on

01:14:08.010,01:14:12.748
the actual wall list, the
traffic is amazing to watch, we
had so many people participate.

01:14:12.748,01:14:17.520
Um so if you don’t know how to
deal with tht talk to somebody
that raised their hand that

01:14:17.520,01:14:22.525
knows how to deal with it, stop
getting tracked. Um let’s see
the CTP stats um and CTP this

01:14:26.696,01:14:31.934
year was crazy. We had lines of
people trying to get signed up,
go in, we were able to

01:14:31.934,01:14:37.006
accomodate a ton of people, we
did the prelims, the mains, the
finals, um. This year we had

01:14:37.006,01:14:42.945
fourteen categories, we spent,
as Grifter said, the entire
year. Some of these challenges

01:14:42.945,01:14:46.882
we’ve been working on for
multiple years some of the
challenges are like three four

01:14:46.882,01:14:51.987
years in the making to do custom
stego and crazy exfiltration
techniques and like the stuff

01:14:51.987,01:14:55.925
that you hear on the scary news,
we’re throwing that inside of
here, so if you’re an actual

01:14:55.925,01:15:01.397
defender or somebody that does
threat hunting, this is your
bag, it is awesome. And so just

01:15:01.397,01:15:07.470
to kind of give you an example
of like what happened um the
third place team Respondo

01:15:07.470,01:15:14.009
answered forty two percent of
all of the content in finals.
The second place team answered

01:15:14.009,01:15:19.014
forty six percent and the first
place team who gets the uh the
wad of cash, two grand uh, and

01:15:21.150,01:15:26.889
the uh the black badge over
here, >>Woo! >>And hopefully uh
a handshake from DT [laughs]

01:15:26.889,01:15:31.894
here you go guys >>What was
their percentage? >>Fifty three
percent [applause] >>Oh wow

01:15:35.097,01:15:40.102
>>Broke the fifty percent mark,
first team in a long time, give
em a hand, and they played

01:15:45.908,01:15:50.913
multiple times. So thank you all
DefCon! See ya [applause]
>>Alright uh the next contest up

01:15:53.549,01:15:58.687
is uh one of the side effects of
competing in contests here at
DefCon they’re a perfect

01:15:58.687,01:16:05.127
representation of that, after
years and years of slaving away
on puzzles, and and mystery

01:16:05.127,01:16:10.132
challenges, and all things what
the h**l is that? Um they
decided, maybe we can try our

01:16:12.301,01:16:18.073
hand at this. And so they
created their own. So welcome to
the stage uh ope- nope, that’s

01:16:18.073,01:16:24.547
in the wrong spot, where are you
guys? Dumpster Fire, we’re just
gonna bring them up anyway. Hey

01:16:24.547,01:16:31.454
whoever’s running the thing,
leave it off, it’s Dungeons at
DefCon [applause] >>Hello um

01:16:31.454,01:16:36.258
we’re Dungeons at DefCon and uh
what we so a bunch of us have
participated in mystery

01:16:36.258,01:16:40.796
challenge in years past what
we’ve found is it’s a lot of
really high level expert level

01:16:40.796,01:16:47.403
content and contests at DefCon
which is awesome if you walk in
as a high level expert, but what

01:16:47.403,01:16:51.607
if you’re not a high level
expert and you wanna learn? Well
that’s what we created, so

01:16:51.607,01:16:58.047
Dungeons at DefCon is a crypto
and puzzle solving competition
and the goal is that anyone can

01:16:58.047,01:17:04.220
walk in off the street and learn
how to do this and win. Um our
contestants spent all weekend

01:17:04.220,01:17:09.859
answering crypto puzzles and
solving challenges and learning
new things because we are going

01:17:09.859,01:17:13.963
to guide you through the
experience, we’re not gonna give
you the answers, but we will

01:17:13.963,01:17:18.968
tell you uh tools you can use
and ways you can think on how to
solve these puzzles. So, um

01:17:21.770,01:17:26.842
first off we wanna give a shout
out to the goons and to the
villages for being our NPCs

01:17:26.842,01:17:32.014

different RPG and this year was

01:17:32.014,01:17:39.021
paranoia themed and they got to
send our players on quests that
they could earn hints. So um

01:17:39.021,01:17:44.026
without anymore we have a couple
of winners. First of all I wanna
shout out to uh The Council of

01:17:44.026,01:17:48.664

Bug Challenge. [applause] >>Hi

01:19:01.503,01:19:06.508
everyone um per DefCon I’m
losing my voice as always um so
really quickly uh the Crypto and

01:19:12.381,01:19:17.386
Privacy Village um is a place
where crypto means cryptography
and privacy is a right and

01:19:20.389,01:19:25.060
[applause] we mean it so much we
said it in neon so if you had a
chance to come by the village

01:19:25.060,01:19:31.900
you would see that we have some
custom um via Alibaba Signs
saying as such um but really I

01:19:31.900,01:19:37.773
wanted to say a quick thank you
to DefCon because without all of
you it would not be possible and

01:19:37.773,01:19:43.312
we’ve been doing this for six
years together and it’s getting
better every year um but thank

01:19:43.312,01:19:47.316
you especially to Hownie, Zant,
and Grifter for all of the
support and work that they’ve

01:19:47.316,01:19:52.321
done to make the Crypto and
Privacy Village successful this
year [applause] um so uh it was

01:19:55.024,01:20:01.664
our sixth year and we are now
officially a 501C3 corporation
um or a non profit and I just

01:20:01.664,01:20:05.834
wanted to say that we are
committed to never taking
corporate sponsorship so you’ll

01:20:05.834,01:20:11.674
know that when we’re talking
about privacy and cryptography
we will not be um have any sort

01:20:11.674,01:20:17.513
of conflict of interest um so
follow us on twitter and um
we’re Zant we’re very happy with

01:20:17.513,01:20:23.919
our space I would like to say
like we felt like we had enough
space this year. So um I’ll I’ll

01:20:23.919,01:20:28.891
now pass it on to Maya and Kevin
who are uh the Crypto and
Privacy Villages contests leads

01:20:28.891,01:20:34.129

to have that now [laughs]
[applause] >>So um as Whitney

01:20:34.129,01:20:39.134
said the the gold bug puzzle is
part of Crypto Privacy Village,
it’s the fourth year that the

01:20:41.837,01:20:45.774
puzzle has been running it’s a
cryptography based puzzle hunt
if you’re familiar with like a

01:20:45.774,01:20:50.145
traditional puzzle hunt um so
there’s a bunch of different
puzzles that teams can solve, um

01:20:50.145,01:20:53.082
and they and then they kind of
solve a metapuzzle at the end
which combines all of them

01:20:53.082,01:20:58.320
together uh it’s the fourth year
of the contest, second year of
black badge, very exciting. Um

01:20:58.320,01:21:02.357
we also had puzzles for junior
cryptographers available so if
you saw us give you a piece of

01:21:02.357,01:21:07.362
paper we weren’t you know we
wanted to get you excited about
crypto, um we had everything

01:21:07.362,01:21:10.733
from you know simple cesar
ciphers, various kinds of
encodings, book ciphers,

01:21:10.733,01:21:15.671
crosswords, nanograms, uh and
Mandill brought sets and remo
data functions so like the whole

01:21:15.671,01:21:19.975
the whole gamut of cryptography
is up for play uh and the prize
which I unfortunately don’t have

01:21:19.975,01:21:24.813
here is also uh a physical
mounted bug like an actual
beetle uh that we that our that

01:21:24.813,01:21:31.487
our winners get. >>So this year
we had a really good showing. We
had two hundred seventy five

01:21:31.487,01:21:36.625
teams registered uh those two
hundred and seventy five teams
submitted two thousand three

01:21:36.625,01:21:41.630
hundred and three wrong answers
[laughter] and twenty seven
correct answers >>Woo [laughter]

01:21:41.630,01:21:46.635
>>So our our winning team solved
eight of the nine puzzles um and
we have here Team Gold Bugs we

01:21:49.304,01:21:54.309
have a representative >>Woo
>>Why don’t you come up here
[applause] And the, so the BBS

01:21:59.681,01:22:04.486
that hosts all the puzzles is
going to be online after the
con, so we encourage folks who

01:22:04.486,01:22:09.091
haven’t had the change to play
the games yet uh to keep going
and remember there’s one left

01:22:09.091,01:22:14.096
available so who will be the
first to catch the gold bug
>>Right on [applause] >>How are

01:22:22.271,01:22:28.210
you >>Alright uh some people
want you to capture a packet,
others want you to capture a

01:22:28.210,01:22:34.716
flag, some just want you do to a
puzzle, um that’s not enough for
this next group um and when I

01:22:34.716,01:22:39.721
mention their name I expect you
to respond correctly, welcome to
the stage, Hack the Planet, HACK

01:22:42.858,01:22:47.863
THE PLANET! [applause] >>Let’s
do that again, hack the
motherf**kin’ planet [laugher]

01:22:50.799,01:22:55.804
>>[from audience] Hack the
planet! >>Uh my name’s Bryson um
the ICS Village started about

01:22:57.906,01:23:02.811
six years ago with just a couple
of us, I think in the real
hacker tradition of just putting

01:23:02.811,01:23:07.649
some shit together and bringing
it here, and they kept
tolerating us doing that we kept

01:23:07.649,01:23:13.455
coming back year after year um
we also just incorporated this
year as a nonprofit so we’re now

01:23:13.455,01:23:18.460
a 501C3 with the mission of
providing education awareness
around critical infrastructure

01:23:18.460,01:23:23.465
security um and we also have to
put on a CTF um our CTF
represents over three thousand

01:23:26.869,01:23:32.875
hours of work with over a
hundred challenges um one
special callout is one of the

01:23:32.875,01:23:38.881
challenges has um involved a
level of exploitation that over
a thousand folks over three

01:23:38.881,01:23:44.953
years have never been able to
solve until today um so that is
uh the i toaster uh you can

01:23:44.953,01:23:49.958
follow it on twitter he talks a
lot of shit [DT laughs] um and
with that uh I don’t have a- am

01:23:52.427,01:23:57.432
I supposed to give like a black
badge or something? Oh Um if any
of you know me I usually am just

01:24:04.573,01:24:08.243
told what to do and then I say
it so I’m now going to not give
the black badge but instead

01:24:08.243,01:24:13.248
recognize third place with Pwnie
IP [applause] second place
Butter Overflow [applause] and

01:24:27.763,01:24:32.768
then the team that truly hacked
the planet, Team Clarity
[applause] >>WOO! [applause}

01:24:44.112,01:24:49.117
>>Thank you I’m intimidated by
your glove >>You don’t know
where it’s been >>I don’t.

01:24:51.787,01:24:56.792
Thanks, thanks. Are you up?
>>Alright yeah um I think even
though these guys are are super

01:25:07.469,01:25:14.409
new to this, you probably know
who they are um. Oh look,
there’s Dungeons! It’s not them.

01:25:14.409,01:25:20.482
Where? It is a Dumpster Fire
alright um anyway like I said
you probably know who they are

01:25:20.482,01:25:24.686
they’ve been doing it for twenty
five years, Hacker Jeopardy.
[applause] >>[with audience]

01:25:24.686,01:25:29.691
Don’t f**k it up! don’t f**k it
up! don’t f**k it up! don’t f**k
it up! [laughter] Dear lord, hey

01:25:36.498,01:25:40.836
everybody I’m Lintel, you know
me as the people of the cause
pan hacker jeopardy twenty five

01:25:40.836,01:25:47.709
years ago >>It’s his fault
>>Jeff asked when >>Him and me
drinking twenty five years ago

01:25:47.709,01:25:52.981
>>Grandpa comes with me
everywhere we go but uh [laughs]
>>Doesn’t make me a grandfather

01:25:52.981,01:25:57.986
>>[laughs] But uh this year uh
we had a contest at other cons
as a precursor to DefCon,

01:26:00.489,01:26:05.761
TourCon, ThoughtCon, DerbyCon,
Hacking Paris, so it was an
international competition.

01:26:05.761,01:26:10.732
Everybody came here not to f**k
it up on the stage in Las Vegas
uh the only casualty is I have

01:26:10.732,01:26:16.171
to report are one team that
didn’t show up mentally and the
ceiling which was much too low

01:26:16.171,01:26:21.943
um yeah [laughter] we were the
other ones, sorry about that,
hope the insurance policy covers

01:26:21.943,01:26:26.948
it. Uh without any uh further
adieu I will uh give you your
twenty fifth anniversary hacker

01:26:29.151,01:26:34.156
jeopardy champion, the Church of
Wifi [applause] >>I just wanna
say um we did this for Tuna uh

01:26:43.031,01:26:48.036
pouring one out would actually
be a sin in the church so, this
one’s for him [applause] >>Woo

01:27:09.791,01:27:16.364
>>Not even gonna try to guess
what’s on the next slide, I’m
over it. Whatever. It’s all good

01:27:16.364,01:27:21.369
um so I believe if memory serves
me correctly [laughs] that these
guys have done this contest,

01:27:24.906,01:27:29.311
this is the second year um I
actually have several people
come up to me to tell me

01:27:29.311,01:27:34.316
specifically about um how great
it had been put together um it
ended up on the radar so I met

01:27:36.518,01:27:41.490
with the organizers, they walked
me through the contest, it’s a
fairly incredible challenge,

01:27:41.490,01:27:46.495
I’ll let them explain it to you
OpenSOC [applause] >>Thanks a
lot Grifter uh so first off for

01:27:54.436,01:28:00.542
anybody that uh doesn’t know
about OpenSOC so we are very
humbly located with the uh the

01:28:00.542,01:28:05.547
new but powerful Blue Team
Village uh it’s the second year
for the village, it’s also the

01:28:05.547,01:28:10.452
second year for OpenSOC at
DefCon but it’s actually our
first year as an official DefCon

01:28:10.452,01:28:15.657
contest so we couldn’t be more
excited to be recognized as a
black badge contest this year.

01:28:15.657,01:28:22.063
Um So so a little bit about
OpenSOC we are very, very
thrilled to be one of the

01:28:22.063,01:28:27.602
probably most defensive focused
competitions here at DefCon um
we are a live fire incident

01:28:27.602,01:28:32.774
response and threat con
simulation, we have a gigantic
virtualized corporate

01:28:32.774,01:28:37.879
environment with everything you
could imagine under the sun from
simulated users, email,

01:28:37.879,01:28:43.118
internet, the whole nine, and
then of course, many many back
to back nation state adversaries

01:28:43.118,01:28:48.924
just wreaking havoc in this
environment and what we do is we
turn several open source threat

01:28:48.924,01:28:55.297
hunt platforms over to what
ended up being nearly six
hundred of you um to understand

01:28:55.297,01:29:00.402
what was taking place inside the
environment so essentially, it’s
a SOC. And the reason we call it

01:29:00.402,01:29:05.106
OpenSOC is because we very
proudly put open source tools at
the forefront of this project,

01:29:05.106,01:29:11.046
so every single one of the
platforms that our participants
used, Graylog, Kolide, OSquery,

01:29:11.046,01:29:16.117
OSsec uh these are all open
source tools so the participants
are getting real hands on

01:29:16.117,01:29:20.388
experience with the amount of
the incredible amount of
visibility we can deploy in

01:29:20.388,01:29:24.826
environments with little to no
investment and uh and track, no
kidding, nation state

01:29:24.826,01:29:29.931
adversaries. So a cool really a
few really awesome stats, so if
anyone here has ever worked a uh

01:29:29.931,01:29:34.536
an incident response with a
nontrivial threat actor you know
how much time can go into

01:29:34.536,01:29:39.441
something like that, right? I
mean, anywhere from forty eight
to seventy two hours, I mean,

01:29:39.441,01:29:44.446
days, weeks. We had twelve of
those types of breaches in this
environment at DefCon. Our

01:29:47.415,01:29:53.388
participants spend up to thirty
one consecutive hours working
through intrusions in this

01:29:53.388,01:29:58.393
environment, we had two hundred
and forty eight teams. Five
hundred and seventy players. Can

01:30:02.163,01:30:08.036
you imagine the kind of elastic
stack you need to support five
hundred consecutive players? It

01:30:08.036,01:30:13.041
was uh, it was a beast. I
couldn’t have done it without a
very large team of uh awesome

01:30:13.041,01:30:18.480
folks, threat analysts, security
architects, you name it, I’ve
got a lot of support to make

01:30:18.480,01:30:23.752
this happen but uh honestly we
wanna really thank the Blue Team
Village for giving us a really

01:30:23.752,01:30:29.257
awesome place to run this event
and uh most of all I wanna thank
all of the nearly six hundred

01:30:29.257,01:30:33.628
people that gave us almost their
entire con to sit there and play
through our scenarios, it was

01:30:33.628,01:30:38.600
incredible. Um, so our
finalists, we took the top
fifteen teams from the general

01:30:38.600,01:30:41.303
category we let them play
through two nation state actors,
Fin7 and APT34 and they ran

01:30:41.303,01:30:43.305
through two simultaneous
intrusions and uh we had some
incredible stats so I’ll just go

01:30:43.305,01:30:45.307
ahead and start with uh our
number three team was Brute
Force with seventeen hundred and

01:30:45.307,01:30:50.312
thirty five points, did an
incredible job with only three
team members. Second place,

01:30:55.250,01:31:00.188
Should Have Slept In, with
eighteen hundred and sixty
points with only two team

01:31:06.194,01:31:12.434
members, and then our first
place, our first place, with
five team members, two thousand

01:31:12.434,01:31:17.872
ninety points, Walmart Greeters.
[applause][cheering] Now there’s
one more thing that I wanna

01:31:17.872,01:31:22.877
cover because it’s very near and
dear to my heart and the hearts
of many others that are here

01:31:24.979,01:31:31.653
with me on stage and those of
you that are in the crowd with
the Blue Team Village I want to

01:31:31.653,01:31:37.258
mention a uh a member of the
Blue Team Village, the inaugural
year, last year un Nolan Berry,

01:31:37.258,01:31:41.229
some of you may know him as
Devnull, uh Nolan’s no longer
with us, he passed away this

01:31:41.229,01:31:46.601
year and so we did several
things to commemorate the memory
of Nolan including the uh the

01:31:46.601,01:31:50.438
badges that you probably see a
lot of Blue Team Village members
wearing, but we also had a

01:31:50.438,01:31:56.211
custom scenario in OpenSOC
called NutrinoCannon and what we
did was we took many different

01:31:56.211,01:32:01.349
awesome aspects of Nolan’s life,
including his previous role as a
DNS architect for Rackspace so

01:32:01.349,01:32:06.821
we used DNS for our C2 mechanism
and we took many other awesome
attributes of Nolan’s life and

01:32:06.821,01:32:11.993
we rolled it into this scenario
and we let six hundred of you
play through it and enjoy an

01:32:11.993,01:32:15.530
incident response intrusion
where you’re getting to
commemorate a really awesome

01:32:15.530,01:32:20.135
hacker in this community that we
are all very missing uh this
year. So that’s all I have,

01:32:20.135,01:32:25.140
thank you so much. [applause]
>>Yeah [laughter] [applause]
[laughter] >>Oh [laughter]

01:32:35.483,01:32:40.488
>>Thank you >>Good to see you
man >>Alright um anything can be
on this next slide I’m going to

01:33:04.379,01:33:11.085
go with uh who is standing near
the stage uh so uh this next
contest has been uh a part of

01:33:11.085,01:33:17.625
the contests and events uh
family for several years uh
they’ve been a black badge

01:33:17.625,01:33:21.763
contest for several years and
that’s because, they bring it.
And they also bring it in a way

01:33:21.763,01:33:28.703
that includes as many people as
humanly possible, the challenges
are highly technical to um the

01:33:28.703,01:33:34.175
absurd um so if players get
stuck on something they can
essentially pass and move on to

01:33:34.175,01:33:39.547
something else um they just
might not like what they get uh
this year I walked by and there

01:33:39.547,01:33:46.254
were people doing burpees and
situps and pushups and I was
like what the hell is that? And

01:33:46.254,01:33:51.259
they’re like, they’re hacking
fitness [laughter] Warl0ck
Gam3z. [applause] >>Hello

01:33:58.166,01:34:03.571
DefCon. It’s been an awesome
year, it’s been an amazing time.
SO this year for Warl0ck Gam3z

01:34:03.571,01:34:10.044
we did incorporate uh hack
fitness, five events, total of
three hundred points where

01:34:10.044,01:34:15.183
basically you could do push-ups,
sit-ups, do a full plank, wall
sit, burpees that kinda thing

01:34:15.183,01:34:20.889
for as much as you can for two
minutes and we actually had some
pretty interesting participants

01:34:20.889,01:34:25.560
that came along and uh it kinda
went a little bit slow in the
beginning, I think folks were

01:34:25.560,01:34:29.464
kinda figuring out what it was,
what to do, and then it just
took off and it was literally

01:34:29.464,01:34:34.269
busy the entire time that we
were there, literally. Line,
ready to go, next person ready

01:34:34.269,01:34:37.906
to go, doing two at a time,
sometimes three at a time, just
to get everybody through and

01:34:37.906,01:34:42.544
they were doing great. The
highest score that we got out of
this and we actually had uh

01:34:42.544,01:34:46.848
three of them was two hundred
and ninety points the folks came
through and they did these

01:34:46.848,01:34:53.054
exercises and it was fantastic.
So that hack fitness was part of
the overall Warl0ck Gam3z CTF so

01:34:53.054,01:34:57.659
we have the physical challenge
of lock picks, we do mindless
things like putting Legos

01:34:57.659,01:35:03.264
together for speed uh and then
we have the packet analysis,
forensics, malware analysis,

01:35:03.264,01:35:07.669
reverse engineering binaries,
those kinds of things. The teams
that you see standing here

01:35:07.669,01:35:13.408
behind me were our third uh
three teams they were our
finalists. In third place we had

01:35:13.408,01:35:18.413
F2TC with a score, forty eight
sixty four [applause] our second
place team is Ambush with thirty

01:35:23.651,01:35:28.656
nine thirty four >>Wow!
[applause] >>And it was a fierce
competition literally right down

01:35:30.792,01:35:36.831
to the very end taking all
things into account our
finalist, PTFS with fifty two

01:35:36.831,01:35:41.836
ninety four, congratulations,
that’s our black badge winner
[applause] so I’d like to say

01:35:46.608,01:35:52.947
thank you very much to Grifter,
DT thank you, DefCon in general,
Be fit, stay healthy, stay

01:35:52.947,01:35:57.952
strong, we look forward to
seeing you at DefCon28
[Applause] >>Yeah! Woo! >>Right

01:36:12.133,01:36:17.138
on [DT laughs] >>Alright uh the
next contest doesn't really need
any introduction I will make a

01:36:24.946,01:36:30.051
comment though about the fact
that this year any contest that
wasn’t located in a village we

01:36:30.051,01:36:35.089
had at Planet Hollywood, right?
We had a contest stage out there
on the mezzanine, we had the

01:36:35.089,01:36:40.795
contest area just packed with
all different kinds of contests
and events, um this particular

01:36:40.795,01:36:45.800
contest we put as close to the
casino as possible um, Capture
the Flag [laughs] [applause]

01:36:53.808,01:36:58.813
>>Hello hackers! >>Woo! >>Woo!
>>We are the order of the
overflow, we’re back, this is

01:37:04.686,01:37:11.059
our second year hosting DefCon
CTF and it is an honor to be
here talking to all of you

01:37:11.059,01:37:17.231
again, last year you might
remember uh I was barely
coherent from sleep deprivation,

01:37:17.231,01:37:22.236
this year’s a little better. So,
we are as last year, still a
bunch of noobs, hackers,

01:37:25.339,01:37:30.311
engineers, professors, and
really very silly people for
agreeing to do this uh even

01:37:30.311,01:37:35.316
though it is incredibly uh
touching that we were given this
trust uh as as silly as that was

01:37:37.418,01:37:42.423
um our first DefCon CTF hosting
experience last year, we ruled
the CTF with an iron fist,

01:37:46.260,01:37:51.265
surveillance was everywhere,
cyber citizens were punished
harshly for any missteps, and

01:37:53.901,01:37:58.906
the world was fully secure
except for the huge amount of
insane hacks carried out by

01:38:01.442,01:38:06.447
rebel factions among the teams.
In the year since then we’ve
started looking to the future,

01:38:09.283,01:38:14.288
we have filled our hearts with
hope for humanity and we have
decided to lead these hackers

01:38:17.592,01:38:23.965
into the future into a world
without security
vulnerabilities. We could not do

01:38:23.965,01:38:30.071
this without the support of a
lot of people, first of all Dark
Tangent, thank you >>You’re

01:38:30.071,01:38:35.076
welcome >>You’re incredible. The
goons, thank you so much for
hosting this event, DefCon in

01:38:37.211,01:38:42.216
helping us host this small event
DefCon CTF inside it uh the
prior DefCon organizer, so as

01:38:45.019,01:38:50.591
you know DefCon organizers swap
out every couple of years, our
the prior DefCon organizers

01:38:50.591,01:38:55.596
LegitBS gave us a lot of wisdom
and help uh to help make this
event a success, our families

01:38:58.132,01:39:04.205
who haven’t seen us almost at
all in a very long time and uh
hope to see us at least sleeping

01:39:04.205,01:39:10.244
next week, and our friends, who
couldn’t be here, you’re seeing
part of the order of the

01:39:10.244,01:39:16.250
overflow behind me uh we also
have Dr. Tiffany Bow who is in
China at the moment, maybe she

01:39:16.250,01:39:21.255
thought this was DefCon China
weekend, uh and we have Jackie,
Debbie, and Jamie, back at ASU

01:39:24.091,01:39:29.096
who made this possible for us to
do. So I was supposed to say all
that to that slide I don't see

01:39:32.433,01:39:38.272
the slide anyways >>It’s right
there, yeah >>Oh brilliant,
alright, so I’ll talk a bit

01:39:38.272,01:39:43.277
about how uh the teams show up
at DefCon because you can’t have
a CTF without the top hackers in

01:39:46.414,01:39:51.419
the world so uh we as previous
years decided to make five top
events around the world pre

01:39:53.654,01:39:58.659
qualifiers uh plus uh DefCon CTF
from last year um these events
all over the world, some of the

01:40:02.430,01:40:09.170
best events in CTF, you should
go and play them over the next
year and join the teams up on

01:40:09.170,01:40:14.175
stage, up on the contest area we
also ran our own uh CTF
qualifiers in which we created a

01:40:16.777,01:40:23.584
new category for DefCon CTF
called fire speed run, we
watched some uh amazing hackers

01:40:23.584,01:40:28.589
solve challenges as quickly as
five minutes from release which
was incredible to see and using

01:40:32.860,01:40:39.567
this we amassed a group of
participants that represented
some of the best hackers on the

01:40:39.567,01:40:44.105
planet, out of the one thousand
two hundred teams that
participated on our on our

01:40:44.105,01:40:50.978
qualifiers, estimated twenty
thousand hackers participating
in the qualifiers, we invited

01:40:50.978,01:40:57.518
sixteen teams to join us here at
DefCon finals, this is them in
alphabetical order, they’re

01:40:57.518,01:41:02.924
incredible. As I announce the
results please remember that
these are the best hackers on

01:41:02.924,01:41:08.496
the planet well plus all of you,
but these are the best hackers
on the planet that also decided

01:41:08.496,01:41:13.501
to show up to the CTF so even
though last plat- place team
they’re incredible, they are the

01:41:16.637,01:41:23.611
last place team at the Olympics
and of course it only gets even
cooler from there. Mention

01:41:23.611,01:41:28.783
quickly about the challenges, we
had a lot of firsts this year uh
we decided to focus on cutting

01:41:28.783,01:41:33.788
edge challenges uh and
espectatability so we had some
very interesting things, we had

01:41:36.457,01:41:41.462
I think the first attack defense
challenge running on iOS of a
iphone not cisco fame, we had an

01:41:44.832,01:41:50.004
attack defense challenge that
was a machine learning
classifier, we had a king of the

01:41:50.004,01:41:55.876
hill challenge where we handed
out the original xbox to all the
teams and had them go at it on a

01:41:55.876,01:42:00.815
crazy patched up version of
Doom. Of course all the network
cheating, all the binary

01:42:02.917,01:42:07.922
patching that they can imagine.
Uh we had a challenge running on
a lisp machine created in the

01:42:10.624,01:42:15.629
1980s or in an emulator there of
uh we have we had a lot of
really crazy stuff and the teams

01:42:19.000,01:42:24.005
really hit it hard, they hacked
nonstop from ten AM friday to
one PM today, they gave it their

01:42:27.408,01:42:32.413
best, so we’ll move on to
announcing how they did. So
these are the uh eleven teams

01:42:35.316,01:42:37.318
that placed sixth through
sixteenth, from all over the
world, really great hackers like

01:42:37.318,01:42:39.320
I said but of course we’re all
interested to see how people did
in the top five, so let’s see.

01:42:39.320,01:42:44.325

Janet, Niel, Linda, Will,
Darrington, and all the
department heads uh that deal

01:50:14.141,01:50:21.014
with this uh planning all year
round. But as we talked about
earlier um all good things must

01:50:21.014,01:50:26.820
come to an end and >>DefCon’s
cancelled! >>DefCon is cancelled
>>DefCon’s cancelled! >>DefCon’s

01:50:26.820,01:50:31.825
cancelled! >>Much like, much
like the uber raffle, yeah
DefCon is cancelled. So uh we

01:50:34.628,01:50:41.368
only knew this hotel for one
brief year, but next year we’re
moving. Moving to what we hope

01:50:41.368,01:50:46.373
to be our home for quite awhile
which is the Caesar’s Forum. Not
the Caesars Forum’s shop, the

01:50:48.542,01:50:54.781
Caesar’s Forum, that’s not
confusing is it? >>Yes! >>Yes!
>>It’s still not up on the

01:50:54.781,01:50:59.720
screen [laughs] >>Oh the- will
you put it on the screen please?
[laughter] Okay there we go, the

01:50:59.720,01:51:04.992
Caesar’s Forum, which is a giant
whole in the ground next door
where they’re building the

01:51:04.992,01:51:11.298
largest structure without a
pillar in the room in North
America. And it will be

01:51:11.298,01:51:17.938
connected to three hotels, um
and that ho- it’s like I think
it’s the LINQ, Flamingo, and

01:51:17.938,01:51:22.943
Harrah’s. So those three hotels
combined with our new megaspace
should provide us uh really in-

01:51:26.713,01:51:31.718
uh some room to grow uh more
flexible space and by the way
it’s happening next year, eighth

01:51:34.555,01:51:41.528
to the eleventh in twenty
twenty, registration opens on
Monday, um and we really hope to

01:51:41.528,01:51:46.199
see you there, we’re taking
feedback, we’re trying to
improve the con, and something

01:51:46.199,01:51:52.439
we didn't mention earlier, who
here remembers the DefCon forums
from years ago? >>Yes! >>Woo!

01:51:52.439,01:51:58.378
>>Okay so they died for awhile,
a year and a half or two, and
the forums are back, and if you

01:51:58.378,01:52:04.084
wanna provide us feedback, if
you wanna ask questions to the
workshop uh instructors, if you

01:52:04.084,01:52:09.890
wanna give us uh drop your docs
on how you solved a challenge,
we’re collecting it all there so

01:52:09.890,01:52:14.595
we have a repository, so for
example, all of the cheats and
wins for the badge are posted

01:52:14.595,01:52:19.199
there from every historical year
um so jump on the forums >>Your
dates are wrong >>My dates are

01:52:19.199,01:52:24.805
wrong, who did that? >>Wasn’t my
fault >>It’s the sixth, it’s the
sixth right? >>Yeah, yeah >>K

01:52:24.805,01:52:28.308
don’t don’t get off that slide
sixth through ninth, you didn’t
see that slide, sixth through

01:52:28.308,01:52:33.313
ninth >>Don’t f**k it up
>>Didn’t see that, do it live
>>Don’t f**k it up [laughter]

01:52:37.084,01:52:42.089
>>Whew >>Drink, drink drink!
>>Alright >>Just edit the slide
>>Just edit the slide? No

01:52:46.126,01:52:51.131
[laughter] Okay, with that, I
would like to officially call
DefCon 27 to a close, thank you

01:52:54.234,01:52:58.739
very much and we’ll see you next
year [applause]
