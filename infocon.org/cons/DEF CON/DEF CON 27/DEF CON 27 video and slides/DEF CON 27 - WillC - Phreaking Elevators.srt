00:00:00.400,00:00:04.371
>>So I prepared a couple of
words just to make sure I I got
everything right here, um so

00:00:04.371,00:00:09.376
Will's hacking addiction started
back about 3 years ago-ish? Um
he somehow found out about a

00:00:12.880,00:00:17.885
hacker camp on an island in
Washington and decided to
volunteer. Uh with his neon sign

00:00:20.487,00:00:25.692
transformer and sewing machine
pedal all packed, he headed off
to camp and ended up having a

00:00:25.692,00:00:31.531
jolly-ol time teaching people
how to burn shit with high
voltage. For some reason he

00:00:31.531,00:00:36.470
decided he needed more hacker
con after that experience, and
like any good addict proceeded

00:00:36.470,00:00:42.876
to volunteer and attend more
than 20 cons a year since then?
>>Um 25 last year >>25 last

00:00:42.876,00:00:48.782
year, so um if there is any
records for attending hacker
cons in a short period, I think

00:00:48.782,00:00:53.787
that Will probably tops that. Um
and so he has been known to
occasionally abduct random con

00:00:56.056,00:01:01.194
organizers and force them into
playing elevator and rooftop cat
and mouse with hotel security at

00:01:01.194,00:01:05.165
some of these events that he
goes to. And occasionally hacks
the set elevators um as you'll

00:01:05.165,00:01:11.204
soon find out in this talk. He
also knows a thing or two about
hacking cars and other stuff, um

00:01:11.204,00:01:16.243
anyway without further adieu I
give you the one and only rock
star, hacker, con addict

00:01:16.243,00:01:21.248
extraordinaire WillC. [applause]
>>Thank you Hakari, Alright guys
welcome to Phreaking elevators,

00:01:33.393,00:01:39.132
so who am I? as Hakari’s
wonderful intro can attest, umm
I do high voltage projects, I am

00:01:39.132,00:01:44.137
also part of the car hacking
village, come stop by hack on
some scooters with me. Uh I did

00:01:46.473,00:01:51.111
win the lifetime badge at
Cyphercon for their CTF, infosec
is a hobby (I might be looking

00:01:51.111,00:01:56.783
for a job in it) Um Im new to
the infosec world, I got that
new coin by pretending to know

00:01:56.783,00:02:01.722
the prices of old DefCon badges.
Alright, so let's jump right in.
First of all a myth- I am sorry

00:02:04.324,00:02:09.629
to disappoint you guys,but you
can't control an elevator
through its phone system, I know

00:02:09.629,00:02:16.003
everyone is really bummed out
now. Alright, if you wanna learn
how to hack elevator systems

00:02:16.003,00:02:22.342
there is these two awesome
people: Deviant and Howard so if
you wanna know more about

00:02:22.342,00:02:27.114
elevators and elevator systems
watch their talk from HOPE, its
2 hours long. If you need a

00:02:27.114,00:02:32.953
shorter version watch the DefCon
talk. The 2 hours long talk they
had 3 minutes in it of elevator

00:02:32.953,00:02:37.958
phone systems. We are also going
to be having more from Deviant
later on in this talk. So some

00:02:40.193,00:02:43.764
topics we are going to be
covering: Elevator phone basics-
who here is using elevator

00:02:43.764,00:02:49.302
phone, wow that's not a lot of
people. Come on I call these
phones all the time [audience

00:02:49.302,00:02:55.042
laughs] alright so we are gonna
be discussing some of the
history. I'm gonna teach all of

00:02:55.042,00:03:01.281
you guys how to use elevator
phones. Um, we are gonna go over
information gathering tools I

00:03:01.281,00:03:06.286
like to use, It's gonna be a
really fun talk. Legal
disclaimer: I am not a lawyer, I

00:03:09.423,00:03:14.828
don't even play one on TV, none
of these talks that are recorded
involved a live human talking on

00:03:14.828,00:03:20.634
the other end but it will get
interesting and fun, also don't
interfere with emergency

00:03:20.634,00:03:25.639
communication systems, uh they
are in place for a reason. So
like I said, please don't hack

00:03:30.510,00:03:35.515
things in the wild [audience
laughs] [audience applauds]
yeah. I wanna stress a point

00:03:39.753,00:03:44.758
here, do not hack the elevators
here, please! I don't know if
anyone is staying there, I mean

00:03:47.127,00:03:53.400
I don't want you to, I dont
wanna tell you where to hack.
Alright so let's get into the

00:03:53.400,00:04:00.073
basics of elevator phone
systems, it's that easy button.
Here are some elevator phones.

00:04:00.073,00:04:05.612
If you take a look um one of
these is a freight elevator. The
little swinging door there, it's

00:04:05.612,00:04:11.017
not like ADA compliant anymore.
All of these have something in
common, its pushing that little

00:04:11.017,00:04:16.756
button. What that button is
gonna do, its gonna connect you
out to a pre programmed phone

00:04:16.756,00:04:21.761
number. Here is some more
photos, so this is a ummm china
and japan, take a look you can

00:04:24.998,00:04:30.003
still see little phone logos, um
you can see an actual hansack
just strapped to the wall there,

00:04:32.606,00:04:38.979
that one was in china. I did not
mess with any of the phones in
China, I'm a little scared of

00:04:38.979,00:04:43.984
it, like so I just took some
photos. Here we see um some from
Dubai and New Zealand, now

00:04:48.188,00:04:52.926
what's interesting about these
and I really wanna touch on this
for any international people.

00:04:52.926,00:04:58.231
There is no elevator phone
button, i hope everyone notices
that there's just those

00:04:58.231,00:05:02.903
emergency rain buttons. Those
buttons what would do is that
they will sound an alarm, that

00:05:02.903,00:05:09.242
alarm is local to where you are,
so what ends up happening is
that, so what ends up happening

00:05:09.242,00:05:15.949
is that you have to hold that
button or press it like a number
of times in, and then it will

00:05:15.949,00:05:19.786
place that call. So it's just
something to be aware of, if
you're brave enough to do this

00:05:19.786,00:05:25.625
internationally. So, how do
phones connect to the outside
world: there's POTS line,VOIP,

00:05:25.625,00:05:30.630
cellphone uh we are gonna be
really covering just the POTS
phone system. It's the plain old

00:05:35.235,00:05:42.108
telephone system. So the device
you use when the handset is
picked up. You'll notice that in

00:05:42.108,00:05:46.613
a lot of older elevators. That's
called a ring down system, we
are going to be covering that in

00:05:46.613,00:05:51.618
the history portion, are the ADA
and the ASME so those are the
two things that cover inside

00:05:54.921,00:06:01.695
elevators, what needs to be
there, how it needs to be there.
So in our history here, elevator

00:06:01.695,00:06:06.700
phones started in 68, we still
found rotary phones, uh just
about every single phone in my

00:06:09.135,00:06:14.808
slides are ones I found in wild.
So this ring down system- you
pick up that line it

00:06:14.808,00:06:20.447
automatically dials the number
for you. Just something to be
aware of, so if you are just

00:06:20.447,00:06:26.319
deciding I wanna place a call,
it doesn't really work like
that. So they got required in

00:06:26.319,00:06:31.324
elevators in 70-76 there. So we
see this is a really good
example of a ring down, and we

00:06:34.227,00:06:39.232
see a rotary phone, that rotary
phone again another ring down
phone. So when you gonna start

00:06:43.837,00:06:48.375
hacking elevator phone systems,
the first thing you should
always do is OSIN, you wanna

00:06:48.375,00:06:53.380
know who that phone dials to,
some phones will dial 911, they
should not dial 911, um some

00:06:57.484,00:07:03.056
phones will dial maintenance
workers, they shouldn't dial
maintenance workers but if you

00:07:03.056,00:07:07.027
are inside an elevator and you
place a phone call at 2 in the
morning you are going to get

00:07:07.027,00:07:12.032
groggy guy that says like: what
do you want?, who is this? and
why do you need my number? Um is

00:07:14.901,00:07:18.972
something to be aware of, so if
you are trying to get
information for a building you

00:07:18.972,00:07:24.544
can use that phone system to
acquire other phone numbers.
Building information, if you are

00:07:24.544,00:07:29.249
trying to do social engineering
you wanna know your building
information. Phone system

00:07:29.249,00:07:34.721
information that one of the most
critical things, phone number
information is also rather

00:07:34.721,00:07:38.425
critical, what ends up happening
is that you could find these
phone numbers out on the

00:07:38.425,00:07:42.629
internet. You can use google,
and you can just google for
elevator phone numbers, people

00:07:42.629,00:07:47.634
have published them. Where is an
elevator phone that's published.
So here we see a certificate

00:07:53.406,00:07:58.411
that is showing an elevator out
of compliance, that's a perfect
pretext for why you are there,

00:08:00.480,00:08:06.119
also there is a notice truck
just roaming around 1 in the
morning. I took that blurry

00:08:06.119,00:08:12.859
photo down in San Diego. Just
something to be aware of so you
know who is servicing your

00:08:12.859,00:08:19.065
elevators, OTIS is one of the
worlds biggest companies, so if
you are going to be doing some

00:08:19.065,00:08:24.938
social engineering you wanna
know how you could pretend to be
an elevator tech, say things

00:08:24.938,00:08:31.678
like Hi! this is Deviant, I am
doing a test on the elevator
phone system. I need to know the

00:08:31.678,00:08:36.416
number I'm calling from, and
they'll read you back the number
then you forget to write it down

00:08:36.416,00:08:41.654
properly, then you ask again:
Can you repeat that number again
for me? cause sometimes they'll

00:08:41.654,00:08:46.659
say it quite fast, um you wanna
be remotely targeting companies,
this is a little more difficult,

00:08:50.897,00:08:55.702
so when you are doing this
social engineering attacks you
are inside that elevator and

00:08:55.702,00:09:00.340
that's the easiest way to get
these numbers. You are inside,
you push that button, you

00:09:00.340,00:09:04.711
pretend to be the elevator tech
and one person is like yeah,
here you go, here is the number,

00:09:04.711,00:09:10.583
enjoy. But if you wanna call a
business, most businesses won’t
know what their elevator phone

00:09:10.583,00:09:15.855
number is, they'll have to look
it up, so understand that and
have a good pretext. Call

00:09:15.855,00:09:20.860
centers um that's the easiest
way to get a number out, you can
call into a call center so

00:09:23.830,00:09:28.168
knowing where that elevator
dials into, if they have a
record of who their customers

00:09:28.168,00:09:31.971
are and then you can social
engineer your way back from
there. There's a lot of

00:09:31.971,00:09:36.643
possibilities, social
engineering is the very valid
attack method and it's going to

00:09:36.643,00:09:41.648
apply to about everything we do
here. So, let's get physical.
How to control an elevator with

00:09:46.019,00:09:50.490
independent service mode and
what to look for. So let's say
you decided alright, I'm gonna

00:09:50.490,00:09:54.961
hop in this elevator and I'm
going to place that phone call.
You want to take control of this

00:09:54.961,00:09:59.966
elevator. So here we see some
key switches, those arrows point
to the independent service mode

00:10:02.268,00:10:09.042
and how to activate it. Again
you shouldn't do this unless
you've had proper training um,

00:10:09.042,00:10:14.047
the I believe the core group
actually offers elevator
training. Flip the switch, I

00:10:16.516,00:10:22.755
don't work there you do. So what
ends up happening here is once
you flip it into Independence

00:10:22.755,00:10:29.762
service mode you have control
when those hog calls are placed,
no one is going to be able to

00:10:29.762,00:10:34.734
get that elevator down to your
floor. So you driving up say the
top floor, well now all you have

00:10:34.734,00:10:39.772
to worry about is who is in that
floor area. You can hold that
door close button, keep the door

00:10:39.772,00:10:44.978
closed, now no one is able to
see you. Maybe they can hear
you, maybe they cant. If they

00:10:44.978,00:10:49.983
can hear you, go to a restricted
floor, inside the restricted
floors, now the way i got this

00:10:52.552,00:10:58.825
photo. I never excited the
elevator uh, I had complete
permission to do this, don't

00:10:58.825,00:11:03.763
worry. So if you are independent
service mode you're actively
going say from floor 20 down to

00:11:07.000,00:11:12.005
floor 1. As you are passing by
floors 11,10 and 9 you have to
get out of independent service

00:11:14.307,00:11:20.346
mode, cause those floors are
still locked even with that mode
engaged. Now what you wanna do,

00:11:20.346,00:11:25.351
you wanna basically as its been
taken out of independent service
mode it levels of at whatever

00:11:30.423,00:11:36.663
the nearest floor is. And then
it just stays there, if someone
calls them it will go to them,

00:11:36.663,00:11:42.268
otherwise the door will be
closed and you are like oh! Did
I break this elevator? Press the

00:11:42.268,00:11:46.072
door open button,easiest way to
escape an elevator, press the
door open button, if you are

00:11:46.072,00:11:52.946
worried you are stocked and then
the doors open and now you are
on a restricted floor. So you

00:11:52.946,00:11:56.649
can flip it back into
independent service mode, now it
wont go anywhere, you can place

00:11:56.649,00:12:01.588
those calls with ease and not
have to worry. So more things we
should on thought, there's other

00:12:03.823,00:12:10.530
ways to get in. You have an
elevator intercom there in the
machine room, all the way to

00:12:10.530,00:12:17.403
your right there, you'll see the
um the patch down panel we are
going to be showing you the tool

00:12:17.403,00:12:22.408
to be able to tap into that,
there is a button tap in, up and
down on the lines, you can dial

00:12:27.380,00:12:33.119
a 1(800) number like
7-800-444-4444 um pretty easy
number to remember, it will read

00:12:33.119,00:12:37.590
you back the number you are
dialing from. So that's when you
are using this tool, you could

00:12:37.590,00:12:42.962
also tap into the phone lines,
just to listen in general, to
what's going on. Um multimeter

00:12:42.962,00:12:47.967
um, multi tools, the alignment
set, landline phones. I really
enjoy landline phones, I don't

00:12:53.406,00:12:58.945
know if you guys new I like
phones. Um you can literally
just plug a landline into an

00:12:58.945,00:13:05.184
elevator phone line and it will
work, it's a POT's line, it's a
plain old telephone system line.

00:13:05.184,00:13:10.289
Thats whats the beauty of this,
there is no real protections,
there's nothing going on besides

00:13:10.289,00:13:16.896
that copper pair and then that
phone. You wanna do some remote
programming? or actually some

00:13:16.896,00:13:21.567
local programming, what you'll
need is those batteries, son 9
volt AA. So now let's start

00:13:21.567,00:13:28.474
getting into the programming of
elevator phones right? Everyone
wants to program an elevator

00:13:28.474,00:13:33.746
phone? I got one right here,
we'll gonna be able to program
this uh come by the car hacking

00:13:33.746,00:13:37.950
village we can have a lot of fun
with this, if anyone has my
phone number they can dial into

00:13:37.950,00:13:42.955
this and start messing around.
So site ID, when you press a
site ID, press number 2 on your

00:13:45.258,00:13:50.363
keypad, most of the time once
you've dialed into the elevator
you've got that phone number you

00:13:50.363,00:13:55.368
gotta see the call center staff,
well you wanna know ok, what are
they saying when there is an

00:13:57.937,00:14:04.310
emergency, just curiosity. Maybe
they haven't program that, once
you place that call you press

00:14:04.310,00:14:09.315
number 2 you'll hear a prompt of
where you are dialing into. If
say someone has taken an

00:14:12.385,00:14:17.724
elevator phone connected it to a
phone conference and then they
themselves have exited the

00:14:17.724,00:14:22.428
conference, what do you do? You
are now having a phone
conversation inside of an

00:14:22.428,00:14:27.066
elevator with everyone else on
this conference. This sounds
hypothetical, is definitely

00:14:27.066,00:14:32.071
happened before, so if this
happens to you press star ##star
00 all these systems are unique

00:14:35.374,00:14:39.445
and we are gonna be getting into
a little bit of how they are
unique and what they apply to.

00:14:39.445,00:14:44.450
There also PBX's and line
concentrators. So the PBX-
Private Branch Exchange,

00:14:49.655,00:14:54.660
elevators can have their own,
they can also be on say the
normal business where hotel

00:14:57.530,00:15:02.468
line, so just be aware of that
so you inside that elevator, you
press that button, and they tell

00:15:04.704,00:15:09.709
you oh you are calling from
4356, that's it. Like can you
repeat that? 4356, you are like

00:15:13.813,00:15:20.586
oh thats not enough digits, you
are on a PBX, you could also
that the voltage of the line, if

00:15:20.586,00:15:25.558
it's a really low voltage, that
could sometimes show you older
PBX equipment there are some

00:15:25.558,00:15:30.963
more phone things you can do in
there. Line concentrators now,
these are really unique to

00:15:30.963,00:15:37.436
emergency phone systems what
ends up happening is, they don't
actually think that multiples of

00:15:37.436,00:15:44.277
these are going to go off at the
same time, so an easy way to
save money is press the, you

00:15:44.277,00:15:50.917
have all of these boxes, I think
i literally have that box that
is in that photo right here. You

00:15:50.917,00:15:56.556
have all of these connected to
one system, they end up dialing
all out of the same line and you

00:15:56.556,00:16:01.894
might be thinking oh what
happens when they are busy? You
get a busy signal, you can only

00:16:01.894,00:16:06.899
use it one at a time. Inbound
calls they pick up with a double
beep and then you are pressing

00:16:08.935,00:16:15.775
1,2 or 3 to enter it an
elevator. So you need to know,
am I dealing with a line

00:16:15.775,00:16:21.414
concentrator or not? That is
sometimes kinda difficult to
know until you've actively

00:16:21.414,00:16:27.820
dialed into the system. Another
easy way to do that though is if
you've dialed the called center

00:16:27.820,00:16:34.260
once, you pushed this emergency
button, got the phone number. Go
to the other side of the

00:16:34.260,00:16:39.298
elevator, push that button see
where that number is calling
from? If it's the same number

00:16:39.298,00:16:44.203
you are on a PBX or line
concentrator. Good things to
understand and when the power

00:16:44.203,00:16:48.674
fails it's a party, its an
active party line, I don't know
if people are familiar with

00:16:48.674,00:16:53.512
party lines but everyone jumps
on and you are connected
together, it's a really good

00:16:53.512,00:16:58.517
time. So elevator intercoms,
there are from the, they are
located outside the elevator,

00:17:01.554,00:17:07.593
normally in the hallway, hostway
or machine room. So these are so
that you can talk to them, this

00:17:07.593,00:17:14.066
is a photo I took, just right
there like next to the elevator,
you can flip the switch, turn it

00:17:14.066,00:17:19.338
on, push the button and listen.
We actually have a video,
hopefully the uh the quality is

00:17:19.338,00:17:26.012
good. >>[off mic comment] So
here we are, you see this
sometimes I've seen elevator

00:17:26.012,00:17:30.249
intercoms, ive seen them in the
motor room more than anything
else but what we are gonna do

00:17:30.249,00:17:35.821
is, we are gonna try, what
happens if people are in the
elevator and you press this and

00:17:35.821,00:17:40.826
you don't say a word, so let me
get in here and I'm just a guy
in an elevator talking. [off mic

00:17:54.473,00:17:59.478
inaudible] So like could you
hear me? I didn't think you
could. >>Let's give it for

00:18:06.485,00:18:12.191
Devian, thank you for that
amusing video [audience
applause] so that's just

00:18:12.191,00:18:17.930
something to be aware of and
easy way to be able to talk into
that elevator, to listen into an

00:18:17.930,00:18:22.935
elevator. I wanna know is anyone
here familiar with the fireman
phone, anyone? So this is a

00:18:25.805,00:18:31.010
system that I have really, oh we
have one person thats awesome,
so you probably know more than

00:18:31.010,00:18:36.015
me about this. Um, I have not
found a lot of information on
these systems, I have talked to

00:18:38.384,00:18:43.255
firefighters about them because
I didn't know a lot of
information. The system looks

00:18:43.255,00:18:49.528
for open uh, if its open, if
it's shorted, if there's ground
faults or front of the line on

00:18:49.528,00:18:54.567
the ground. They have two
different styles of wiring I'm
not gonna be getting into it, I

00:18:54.567,00:18:59.271
just wanted people to be aware
that these is a phone system
inside of an elevator, so

00:18:59.271,00:19:04.777
understand that if you are going
to plug into this, it will sound
an alert, it will be at whatever

00:19:04.777,00:19:09.782
the command center on like alarm
panel. So just understand that,
these are the phones to plug, so

00:19:14.053,00:19:19.291
you plug in, we are talking.
This are used by firefighters,
if the radios aren't gonna work

00:19:19.291,00:19:25.064
inside that elevator, they are
bene use less and less, um you
could also find them outside the

00:19:25.064,00:19:30.069
elevators. So again when you are
going through, you can see them
sometimes even in this hotels,

00:19:32.204,00:19:37.209
look for that little panel and
that jack. So line detection,
when your elevator phone is

00:19:42.014,00:19:47.019
connected now they are mandating
that you have this device, this
was taken at the airport. That

00:19:50.423,00:19:55.761
sense is the line active is
this, is this ok?, is everything
alright? And it checks maybe

00:19:55.761,00:20:02.168
once every 10 minutes and inside
that checking all its gonna do
is sound like a buzzer or a

00:20:02.168,00:20:07.173
little alarm is not actively
going uh to call someone else,
cause that line is now default.

00:20:10.609,00:20:15.614
Easy way to bypass it, cut the
power to it, you can also buy
the system itself, get the key

00:20:17.783,00:20:22.588
for it, you can control the
volume, you can reset the
device. You can say hey! don't

00:20:22.588,00:20:28.527
worry about if there's no phone
line connected to that elevator
for like 24 hours and read the

00:20:28.527,00:20:33.532
manual. So like the later half
of my talk RTFM, reading that
manual is the easiest way to

00:20:38.504,00:20:43.442
hack an elevator and I literally
just walk around with elevator
phone manuals, they are not that

00:20:43.442,00:20:48.447
big, they are fun to read. I
hope everyone like picks one up,
so who wants to like dial into

00:20:51.450,00:20:56.455
an elevator and like listen to
what goes on? [laughter] There
you go, someone wonderful! [dial

00:21:04.330,00:21:09.335
tone][beeping] Alright hopefully
everyone hear that. So what we
have there and I I personally

00:21:14.940,00:21:19.945
I'm not a fan of recording other
people uh I did not wanna record
the conversations, that can

00:21:22.181,00:21:27.186
ensue from doing this um so,
after you've heard that noise
you are inside the elevator,

00:21:29.288,00:21:34.293
you'll heard weird echo and you
can mute your phone, just hit
the mute and now you can just

00:21:36.829,00:21:41.834
listen to them and listen to
whoever is inside the elevator.
You've got a few problems with

00:21:41.834,00:21:48.774
this, if you don't say anything
and they don't say anything
it'll time out, if they are

00:21:48.774,00:21:54.480
saying things and you are just
listening like hearing what's
going on, um, what ends up

00:21:54.480,00:21:59.485
happening is there is a
connection time limit and again
it's all listed in your manual.

00:22:01.754,00:22:08.327
If you want to reprogram that
connection time limit, you go
oop there it is, you set it to

00:22:08.327,00:22:13.332
like 9 the max it can go. Really
0 through 9 or 1 through 9 are
your ranges for these systems.

00:22:16.902,00:22:21.907
>>[dial tone][beeping]there is
an emergency telephone located
at. This is an elevator

00:22:24.143,00:22:29.148
emergency inside car one a
[audio feedback] please wait for
two way communication thank you.

00:22:33.219,00:22:38.224
Main menu press 1 to talk 2 to
program or star 0 to disconnect.
[laughter] >>So this is just

00:22:44.697,00:22:49.702
another example of a different
system I think we dial into.
Instead of dropping straight

00:22:53.172,00:22:58.811
into the elevator we now have to
hit 1 to be able to talk to
those people, hit 2 to be able

00:22:58.811,00:23:04.984
to program and star 0
disconnect. It just tells you, I
did not prompt that message at

00:23:04.984,00:23:09.989
all. >>[dial tone][beeping] This
is the automated emergency
telephone located at, press 1 to

00:23:12.391,00:23:17.396
talk to the party, 2 to program,
0 to disconnect. Press 1 to talk
to the party, 2 to program, 0 to

00:23:24.370,00:23:31.076
disconnect. >>I don't know if
you guys can notice a pattern
here so, again different phone

00:23:31.076,00:23:37.883
system, different menu set up,
just something to be aware of. I
didn't take out the located out,

00:23:37.883,00:23:44.823
I would have tried to beep it
out or something like that. It
just didn't have it, when you

00:23:44.823,00:23:49.762
start getting into this and you
dial into the elevator, you are
hitting number 2 to prompt that

00:23:49.762,00:23:54.767
site id, sometimes you wont get
a site id back. And that means
that elevator is not up to code

00:23:57.670,00:24:03.375
compliance and that's a problem.
Um I have not done this
personally but I've definitely

00:24:03.375,00:24:08.380
been on calls were like a ,
phone freaking party line, and
someone dials into an elevator,

00:24:11.383,00:24:16.588
prompts at site id and nothing
happens and then they go ok,
well lets reprogram this and put

00:24:16.588,00:24:23.595
in a site id, i know where this
building is and we brought
elevators up to code that way.

00:24:23.595,00:24:28.133
[audience laughs] I do not
encourage any of you to do this,
thats hacking, and you need

00:24:28.133,00:24:33.138
passwords to get into these
systems anyway, so good luck. So
let's go four ways to program an

00:24:35.941,00:24:40.946
elevator: key pads, switches,
remotely and programming cable.
The programming cable is mainly

00:24:42.981,00:24:47.986
with RTFM phones. I won't be
getting into that um, there is
this whole topic can get delve

00:24:50.456,00:24:55.461
into way deeper and heavier, um
If you wanna like dive into one
phone versus another, this is

00:24:58.030,00:25:04.002
really just a broad overview to
get everyone here started in
hacking elevators. At least

00:25:04.002,00:25:09.007
looking at these systems,
understanding them. So if you
are going to use the keypad,

00:25:11.310,00:25:16.749
these buttons don't work like
you think they do, the way to
deal with this kind of phone you

00:25:16.749,00:25:23.689
see that line volt, connect it
right there. You look up your
handy dandy manual. This is just

00:25:23.689,00:25:28.694
the printed out version, um but
there will be manuals online. So
and are called vicking uh a

00:25:33.432,00:25:38.270
whole bunch of different
elevator manufacturers have
their manuals all online for you

00:25:38.270,00:25:43.275
to download PDFs. You are going
to be doing switches, so the
interesting thing about switches

00:25:45.377,00:25:50.382
is that they, they all follow a
common type,so one generally
sees, and this is like a cross

00:25:52.918,00:25:57.055
brands, to be like
connect/disconnect so what that
means is that when you push that

00:25:57.055,00:26:02.895
elevator phone button, you end
up being able to place the call,
connect it, you can also press

00:26:02.895,00:26:08.000
it again to disconnect it. So if
someone is dialing into that
elevator you are in, just press

00:26:08.000,00:26:13.539
the button again if you dont
wanna talk to them. Don't deal
with that. Um position 3, learn

00:26:13.539,00:26:18.544
mode programming phone so, for
some reason they allow this to
be engaged when number 2 is on

00:26:21.213,00:26:26.218
allow incoming calls. This is
how it's set up by default. This
is a brand new elevator phone I

00:26:32.624,00:26:37.629
have all 3 engaged and I didnt
flip a switch, they are actively
just selling this units, brand

00:26:40.466,00:26:45.471
new from the factory, with the
position 1 on, position 3
on,position 2 on. But we might

00:26:48.540,00:26:53.545
be thinking they got passwords,
alright. How can you get past
the passwords, the passcodes?

00:26:55.814,00:27:00.752
Well there you go, here you go
guys uh, everyone just take a
picture of this [audience

00:27:07.025,00:27:12.030
applause] So what I did was I
read so many elevator phone
manuals, its crazy, viking

00:27:16.101,00:27:22.007
looked like they had a really
secure like default code, up
until you realize it's spells

00:27:22.007,00:27:27.012
VIKING, uh the TRE
communications, I have no idea
what's going on with their

00:27:30.415,00:27:35.420
number its a 5 digit number, the
only one I've ever seen, it's a
very like odd system, the # 9

00:27:38.690,00:27:44.496
thousands uh I've seen that
before and the only text file
that ever read about elevator

00:27:44.496,00:27:48.834
phones, cause I did a lot of
research on this, there's not a
lot of information on these

00:27:48.834,00:27:53.739
elevator phone systems. That's
why I wanted to give this talk
in general, so enjoy the default

00:27:53.739,00:27:58.744
passwords I see a trend with
this 123456 though. What happens
if I reprogram the password? So

00:28:02.748,00:28:07.753
we break it down, your 12345 and
123456 most common, they also
top the charts, um this person

00:28:10.923,00:28:16.828
did some really cool research on
pin numbers and pin codes. One
of the most commonly once that I

00:28:16.828,00:28:21.833
use, We made a top 20 list, so
let's say for example, we have a
4 pin code you have a 26.83%

00:28:26.171,00:28:31.443
change of getting it, that drops
right down if that default
password does not work so now

00:28:31.443,00:28:36.448
you have 16.12% , it doesn't
seem like a lot but if you have
a random an absolute random code

00:28:39.618,00:28:46.224
you have a .02% change of
getting it right. So you really
increase your chances just by

00:28:46.224,00:28:51.229
using that default or the most
common top 20 list. So now that
we know the phone number, we

00:28:54.800,00:28:59.805
have the passwords cause no one
ever changes the password, no
one. Options? We have some

00:29:04.476,00:29:09.481
really fun options, so the phone
number you dial out to we've got
a few of this is, we'll leave

00:29:14.920,00:29:21.893
this one here has the option for
5 different numbers. When you
dial a number if its busy, if

00:29:21.893,00:29:26.431
that person doesn't answer and
then it switches to the next
number and the next number. Your

00:29:26.431,00:29:31.770
connection time, so the default
connection time for most phones
is about 3 minutes, after 3

00:29:31.770,00:29:37.109
minutes you get a prompt that
says hey! would you like to stay
connected? Press 3 to stay

00:29:37.109,00:29:42.748
connected and you get that every
30 seconds, really difficult to
have a conversation with someone

00:29:42.748,00:29:49.621
for more than 3 minutes, so you
go thru your manual, you have to
figure out where in that

00:29:49.621,00:29:54.626
position you are going to be so,
slot 1 is gonna be filled up
with the phone number, slot 2 is

00:29:57.796,00:30:03.869
gonna be your connection time,
your tone or pulse, silence in
and out so, you are gonna dial

00:30:03.869,00:30:08.874
these numbers. Connection time
hit 9, your pulse or tone
probably 1 for tone, silence

00:30:11.810,00:30:16.815
timeout so you know if it's
after 30 seconds and no one is
speaking it will drop that call,

00:30:18.917,00:30:23.922
set that to its maximum. You can
go in and go on and on and on,
there are so many options,

00:30:26.625,00:30:33.532
there's no way to tell, I can't
tell you say hey! dial into this
phone, try all the default

00:30:33.532,00:30:39.671
passwords and then just keep
hitting 9, does not work like
that I am sorry but if you

00:30:39.671,00:30:43.608
happened to know the phone cause
you pushed that button, you got
that phone number, you download

00:30:43.608,00:30:47.713
that manual right off the
internet, you can then
re-program it to whatever you

00:30:47.713,00:30:53.952
want. You call the recording. So
let's switch some practical
text, let's take a look at

00:30:53.952,00:30:58.924
what's going on here. Denial
Service you can make sure that
line no longer functions, no

00:30:58.924,00:31:02.894
longer calls the correct number,
you can have it call you
instead, so if you plan on

00:31:02.894,00:31:09.234
trapping someone inside of an
elevator, I don't recommend
that, you can have it call you

00:31:09.234,00:31:14.239
and then you can play some games
with them. Uh you can bypass
line detection. So turning the

00:31:16.908,00:31:22.948
elevator into a covert listening
device you have some problems
with this, were LED will light

00:31:22.948,00:31:27.619
up, it will be blinking when its
making that connection, it'll
say solid when you are

00:31:27.619,00:31:32.624
connected, your connection time
as I was talking earlier and
that weird like tone noise you

00:31:35.160,00:31:41.833
heard, that's all gonna be
playing in sync inside that
elevator. Again if you guys

00:31:41.833,00:31:48.707
experience this and you dont
wanna talk to whoever is on the
other end just hit that button,

00:31:48.707,00:31:53.712
it will hang up on them. So you
have an open phone line, you can
exfiltrate data, has anyone ever

00:31:57.349,00:32:02.287
used a dial up modem before, oh
great a few people excellent.
You can register services like

00:32:04.389,00:32:09.394
google voice, and now dialing
some numbers, who thinks this is
the worst attach possible you

00:32:12.631,00:32:18.603
can do? You can call other phone
numbers from an elevator,
anyone? Alright well it is the

00:32:18.603,00:32:25.410
worst I think and this is why.
So there's 60 elevator at a
University,I took out the

00:32:25.410,00:32:30.382
University name cause someone
told me to. Each one of those
elevators has their own phone

00:32:30.382,00:32:35.387
line, a billing cycle say 30
days at 24 hours 720 hours times
that by 60 minutes 43200 minutes

00:32:39.391,00:32:44.396
times that by the 60 elevators,
you have like 2.5 million
elevators minutes all of them.

00:32:47.566,00:32:52.571
Times that by the 2.55 that you
charge for dialing a 900 number.
So you set up your own 900

00:32:55.941,00:33:02.047
number, you have all these
elevators call it, you make 6.6
million dollars right there.

00:33:02.047,00:33:05.417
This is the only time I ever
thought about not giving this
talk cause like, man I could be

00:33:05.417,00:33:10.422
a millionaire? [audience laughs]
Yeah um I really think this is
kinda crazy cause there are

00:33:13.658,00:33:19.598
still 900 numbers around and if
you were to be malicious there
is nothing stopping this. It's a

00:33:19.598,00:33:24.903
pots line, it's a plain old
telephone system line, just
understand that it's a crazy

00:33:24.903,00:33:29.908
thing I never heard of anyone
even trying this kind of thing
so I like to think it is

00:33:33.111,00:33:38.116
entirely theoretical I've never
done it. So are we all doomed?
No, no we are not. Look at

00:33:42.020,00:33:47.025
monitoring so what are we having
an hour long phone call? Why are
there 30 people calling into the

00:33:49.227,00:33:54.232
same elevator every day? Like
that's a problem, alerting like
if there is an emergency someone

00:33:56.568,00:34:02.073
should deal with that emergency.
All of these things these are
supposed to be outliers, these

00:34:02.073,00:34:07.145
are things that are like, what
in the world is going on here?
Someone should investigate this

00:34:07.145,00:34:12.851
stuff, no one ever does cause no
one ever ends up understanding
and knowing hey! someone is

00:34:12.851,00:34:18.290
calling into the elevator but
before people get in, they've
you know extended that

00:34:18.290,00:34:23.428
connection time, they've made it
so nothing is happening. No one
ever looks the little button and

00:34:23.428,00:34:28.133
when you are looking, you could
say hey you pushed that button
and they'll tell you no I

00:34:28.133,00:34:32.470
didn't, and you say yes you did
thats how Im talking to you.
It's a really interesting

00:34:32.470,00:34:39.411
conversation you can have with
someone, not saying I've
definitely done this. So If any

00:34:39.411,00:34:44.416
manufacturers are out there, uh
prompts to Otis for reaching out
to me um, no default passwords,

00:34:47.452,00:34:54.092
don't allow the most common top
20 pins. Like we don't allow
"password" as a password anymore

00:34:54.092,00:35:00.598
right? Why should we allow
123456?Like that just seems
crazy to me. Don't allow remote

00:35:00.598,00:35:06.972
programming, uh I know elevator
technicians and when they are
reprogramming a phone, they are

00:35:06.972,00:35:12.677
there on site, they are working
on the elevator anyways, they've
just installed that phone, they

00:35:12.677,00:35:18.249
have access to it. I know
understand like, specially see
here: for this one, there is no

00:35:18.249,00:35:23.521
easy way to to allow that remote
programing, you have to have
that local programming. You need

00:35:23.521,00:35:28.526
to dial into it. I get that, I
understand, that's ok! After you
are done, it should have to then

00:35:30.695,00:35:36.735
put back into a no programming
mode so the VIKING systems, the
newer ones are doing that. The

00:35:36.735,00:35:41.740
only issue is, is that you push
that button again and they left
it in a programming mode, its

00:35:44.209,00:35:50.315
gonna call the VIKING center
instead, it's not gonna just not
work. So you are gonna get

00:35:50.315,00:35:55.420
someone eventually, like it's
crazy to me. You should've had
that understanding of what

00:35:55.420,00:36:01.459
happens when these phones are
left in programming mode,
understand that they shouldn't

00:36:01.459,00:36:06.965
be able to be remotely
programmed. Train your call
centers, understand that social

00:36:06.965,00:36:13.972
engineering attacks happen, be
aware, be ready for them. So
lets go further, now everyone

00:36:13.972,00:36:19.177
doesnt wanna take an elevator
ever again. Go to pools,
University campuses, meeting

00:36:19.177,00:36:26.151
areas. So this is a photo I took
in seattle, of a meeting are
inside of a business and I asked

00:36:26.151,00:36:30.822
this shop owner, like why? Why
is this here? And he is like
well they made me put it in. You

00:36:30.822,00:36:36.795
know there is building codes now
that are mandating these
emergency phones to be inside

00:36:36.795,00:36:41.800
your businesses. So everything I
just talked about with the
elevators, relates right down to

00:36:44.035,00:36:50.708
the wall, right there to the
stairs and walkways. So when you
are walking around start

00:36:50.708,00:36:56.314
noticing, hey! like why those
that box on the wall say
emergency and there is a little

00:36:56.314,00:37:02.420
button? Someone could just dial
into that and listen to you as
you walk along your path. Like I

00:37:02.420,00:37:08.593
used to, I was on a campus and
i'll see people walk done this
bike lane and all along the bike

00:37:08.593,00:37:13.598
lane there's this little, little
post and yeah you could listen
in right like to each post, just

00:37:16.367,00:37:19.871
dial to the next one before they
got there so you could listen to
their conversation all along the

00:37:19.871,00:37:24.876
walkway. And again do not do
these people, please, join
people's privacy. So just

00:37:29.881,00:37:34.886
understand these systems are
outside the elevator, so if you
want to learn more here are some

00:37:37.388,00:37:43.461
really good resources: watch the
Telechallenge, pit to Penthouse,
reading manuals man, just pick

00:37:43.461,00:37:48.733
up any old manual. If you wanna
read this one, let me know, I'll
be happy to give that to you. Uh

00:37:48.733,00:37:53.738
Cstar nte, Bin Rev those are two
really good resources uh to
understand phone systems. Not a

00:37:57.575,00:38:01.880
lot of people are familiar with
them, a lot of phone freakers
like to hand out there and

00:38:01.880,00:38:08.853
discuss this systems, just
starting to play around. Wanna
play at home? Here you go,

00:38:08.853,00:38:13.858
$50-$100 dollars you know
slightly broken elevator phone.
I've definitely gotten then in

00:38:16.494,00:38:23.268
like a $50 dollar range that
work. So just be aware of that.
New phones they cost you know

00:38:23.268,00:38:28.273
$100 -$300 dollars any idea why
they cost so much, like they are
simple systems. So if you wanna

00:38:32.844,00:38:37.849
play around if you notice my
shirt FUTELL, there a phone call
uh, they are a non profit phone

00:38:40.018,00:38:46.257
company I'm an operator for. PLA
they've put up some phone
systems. ClownSec, Phunhouse

00:38:46.257,00:38:53.164
there's more um just be aware.
So dialing into these, you can
do is you can hack the um the

00:38:53.164,00:38:59.604
PLA has a bunch of answering
machines set up, start playing
around with these systems again.

00:38:59.604,00:39:05.476
I feel like this community is
forgotten about phone freaking
as an active attack and that's

00:39:05.476,00:39:10.014
one of the reasons why I really
wanted to get this talk out
there to understand that these

00:39:10.014,00:39:15.019
things are still happening
today. Thank you guys, thank you
all to my infosec friends

00:39:17.589,00:39:22.594
[audience applause] @plugxor and
@wireghoul really help me out um
