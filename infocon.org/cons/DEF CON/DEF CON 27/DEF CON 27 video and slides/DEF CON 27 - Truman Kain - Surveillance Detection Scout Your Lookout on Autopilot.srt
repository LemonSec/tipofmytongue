>>Please help me welcome to the
stage Truman Kain [applause]
>>Thank you. And I just go my

00:00:04.238,00:00:09.243
uhh, hacker tracker
notification, so thank you to
the hacker tracker people as

00:00:16.717,00:00:22.623
well. Had to subscribe to my own
talk, I mean, come on. Uhm my
name is Truman Kain I’m a-a- Pen

00:00:22.623,00:00:25.893
tester at a- Tevora we’re
located in Southern California,
we are based in Southern

00:00:25.893,00:00:31.865
California and I conduct a
social engineering pen test
there fishing, phishing physical

00:00:31.865,00:00:36.870
a- so. We’re gonna get into the
a- TLDR which is that Autopilot
cameras are good for a lot more

00:00:39.039,00:00:45.445
than driving. So are Teslas
that’s the end of my fanboy
rant. No its not. a- and the

00:00:45.445,00:00:50.751
next slide is gonna be my
referral code. No, [audience
laughter] not. So the huge

00:00:50.751,00:00:54.655
disclaimer on this is use your
own risk everything I’m going to
talk about is for educational

00:00:54.655,00:00:58.759
purposes only. Of course check
your local and state laws to
make sure you’re not breaking

00:00:58.759,00:01:03.697
any laws if you decide to check
out this framework. Last year a-
Psy and Agent X had a talk on a

00:01:06.066,00:01:10.571
surveillance counter
surveillance surveillance
detection route that is somewhat

00:01:10.571,00:01:15.676
of what inspired me to submit
this talk I spoke with Psy after
ahm..a-a around the closing

00:01:15.676,00:01:21.515
ceremony last year about the
potential possibility of using
phones or something like that

00:01:21.515,00:01:26.520
uhm to basically in real time a-
do some kind of license plate
detection or to aid in SDRs and

00:01:29.323,00:01:32.826
it just didn’t really seem
possible but a- with a- Tesla
and Sentry mode is just kind of

00:01:32.826,00:01:38.131
a natural fit and I’ll get into.
Uh- why Tesla a- for this kind
of framework. So why Tesla,

00:01:38.131,00:01:42.669
there are three cameras built in
and really there are eight in
the newer vehicles potentially

00:01:42.669,00:01:47.674
all of them uhm- but Tesla gives
you access to three feeds. The
front camera, the left basically

00:01:50.077,00:01:54.348
what the left right mirrors see
as well. So if you plug in a
flash drive you’re able to get

00:01:54.348,00:01:57.818
essentially all that video uh-
so that’s uh- that built in you
don’t have to mount any dash

00:01:57.818,00:02:04.758
cams. Uhm- second is the
detailed vehicle and owner API.
Basically we can Ping roughly

00:02:04.758,00:02:08.462
every second, we can do it more
but you probably get- get-
really limited or potentially

00:02:08.462,00:02:12.799
blocked so I’m not really taking
any chances with that but every
second I can get vehicle

00:02:12.799,00:02:18.505
location data, heading data, how
fast I’m going, and so that’s
really well you can even, you

00:02:18.505,00:02:22.175
can even program it to honk at
people if you want to. Uhm- but-
I don’t want to make anyone

00:02:22.175,00:02:27.180
angry. So using that data we are
able to correlate with the video
makes person uhm- interesting

00:02:29.483,00:02:34.454
use cases. The other part is
that its an electric vehicle,
sentry mode is uh if you have it

00:02:34.454,00:02:39.092
enabled means that the car is
always on. Its not really gonna
be using too much extra battery

00:02:39.092,00:02:44.664
uhm- to keep that on. Uhm- so
that’s awesome because with a
gas vehicle you have to either

00:02:44.664,00:02:48.702
keep the car running if that’s
powering your devices or you
have to have huge battery pack

00:02:48.702,00:02:52.172
that you have to worry about
switching out and charging that
type of thing. Uhm- the next

00:02:52.172,00:02:57.778
part is the in car web browser
which makes it extremely easy to
see these real time

00:02:57.778,00:03:02.783
notifications if uhm- I a follow
vehicle is detected. Uhm- of
course that’s not completely

00:03:02.783,00:03:08.955
necessary uh- but uh- it
definitely helps. So again the
basics of what surveillance

00:03:08.955,00:03:14.528
detections scout is, the
real-time license plate rec- uh
recognition,f- face detection

00:03:14.528,00:03:17.097
those are pretty self
explanatory so I’m not gonna go
on to those but on the next

00:03:17.097,00:03:22.335
slide I’ll get into what real
time it means in this context.
Uhm- recon and pattern of life

00:03:22.335,00:03:28.608
querying is essentially just
rejecting or just u-using some
operators on that data that’s

00:03:28.608,00:03:33.613
found and of course this is uhm-
open source and locally
deployed. I was very tempted to

00:03:36.283,00:03:41.288
use S3 or AWS service for this
type of thing but I definitely
decided that was a bad idea uhm-

00:03:44.591,00:03:49.863
because I just feel like its
going to end with people getting
their uhm footage dumped

00:03:49.863,00:03:55.135
basically. So, highly recommend
running this locally and that’s
why its not you know what

00:03:55.135,00:04:00.073
natively integrated with s3. So,
let’s get into what real-time
is. Every minute Tesla is

00:04:02.909,00:04:07.914
writing three mp4 files to this
flash drive and so you have a
san- and and they’re ro-roughly

00:04:10.484,00:04:14.488
three megs each so every minute
you have roughly ninety- ninety
megs of video to search through

00:04:14.488,00:04:20.260
as soon as those mp4s hit the
flash drive which its not a
flash drive we-were using like a

00:04:20.260,00:04:24.397
computer type device to act as
the flash drive in this case
we’ll talk more about that in a

00:04:24.397,00:04:30.737
second. But as soon as the
device hit this disk, I know its
not disk its solid state drive

00:04:30.737,00:04:35.342
inference is gonna start uhm
right before that we’re just
pulling just the I frames to get

00:04:35.342,00:04:40.881
us down from what is the uhm-
thirty six frames per second on
a normal uhm- video as soon as

00:04:40.881,00:04:45.085
it's written to four frames per
second and so we’re getting rid
of a lot of those blurred frames

00:04:45.085,00:04:49.156
that we’re not gon- most likely
we’re not gonna get anything out
of anyway uhm- in you settings

00:04:49.156,00:04:53.927
you can adjust that so. It’s not
gonna you know, it’s gonna take
longer to run the inference but

00:04:53.927,00:04:57.397
you’re going to have more
accurate detections and and more
detections so that’s all

00:04:57.397,00:05:02.802
adjustable. But that’s what we
might real time to find as soon
as the you know files hit the

00:05:02.802,00:05:07.040
disk we start running the
inference and then it ends up
being pretty fast if you opt for

00:05:07.040,00:05:12.612
the higher quality hardware so.
Then it just come down to uhm-
to uh- cost uhm- savings persp-

00:05:12.612,00:05:19.619
perspective. So let’s talk about
some of the counter surveillance
scenarios. If you’re parked you

00:05:19.619,00:05:24.224
wanna know, you know, which cars
or people uh- er- which cars or
people are loitering near my

00:05:24.224,00:05:30.363
house or my car uhm- you’re not
really gonna see any faces while
you’re driving, the cameras just

00:05:30.363,00:05:35.235
aren’t on that level yet and I’m
sure you could if you use third
party dash cams and this sof-

00:05:35.235,00:05:39.639
the software components of this
could be modified to work with
third part dash cams absolutely.

00:05:39.639,00:05:44.811
But its just not gonna be as
natural of a fit. Uhm- during
your drive, things like how long

00:05:44.811,00:05:48.915
has been the car behind me or
have I seen that car before and
the last one is one that I

00:05:48.915,00:05:55.422
really want to highlight. Is the
fact that this device isn’t
going to take the place of an

00:05:55.422,00:05:59.693
actual standard surveillance
detection after someone is
running and someone is still is

00:05:59.693,00:06:03.730
gonna have to remain highly
vigilant if they’re in a
situation where they’re

00:06:03.730,00:06:09.436
seriously ru- running a
surveillance detection routes
daily. Uhm- But the computer is

00:06:09.436,00:06:14.574
not gonna forget for months,
years or decades. And not to say
that cars should be following

00:06:14.574,00:06:20.914
you for year maybe I’m the only
one I don’t know, but the
computer is not gonna forget and

00:06:20.914,00:06:25.518
that’s what makes it ahm- really
helpful ahm- to look at it from
a like a big data perspective.

00:06:25.518,00:06:32.459
Later on we will look into that
ah- in a demo. So some recon
query scenarios this basically

00:06:32.459,00:06:37.864
means so from a physical pen
testing or red teaming
perspective. You can essentially

00:06:37.864,00:06:42.569
park outside of an office that
you’re gonna run a physical pen
test on. Leave it there- for a

00:06:42.569,00:06:47.574
day later on ge-the and-and you
can put them on hotspot there if
you wanna build a you know- like

00:06:49.809,00:06:56.049
a wifi some type of myfi thing
to real time remotely access the
data that’s there or you could

00:06:56.049,00:07:00.420
just pick it up later and run
these recon queries to see when
the first person arrive in the

00:07:00.420,00:07:04.524
moring, when the last person
leave at night. You could scrape
linked in for like a company

00:07:04.524,00:07:07.961
that you would be running
physical pentest on, get these
photos load them into your

00:07:07.961,00:07:14.134
database and then run facial
recognition again for such
photos. Ah so its somewhat scary

00:07:14.134,00:07:19.806
but ah- definitely extremely
powerful tool from a physical
ah- and in just perspective as

00:07:19.806,00:07:26.713
well. So the Web Stack is not
super important ah because you
could modify this however you

00:07:26.713,00:07:31.718
want. Vue is just a framework
that I prefer ahm- and then
Mongo DB again because I wasn’t

00:07:35.088,00:07:41.461
to put this on fire base ah- I
just, I’m not, I just want to
keep everything local, specially

00:07:41.461,00:07:46.466
when I’m testing this with all
my drive data. The computer
Vision Stack I expected this

00:07:49.703,00:07:54.708
might change a little bit but
I’ll give you a little bit of a
back story. I tried to initially

00:07:56.776,00:08:01.381
build this out myself, I was
like, ok, AI, computer vision
I’m gonna train these model. So

00:08:01.381,00:08:06.286
I just started labeling them
left and right and probably
spent close to 20 hours just

00:08:06.286,00:08:10.490
going through gigs of ahm- video
footages and just cutting out
frames, dragging the little

00:08:10.490,00:08:14.227
boxes of the license plates, I
even rope in some of the interns
which I appreciate you guys. Did

00:08:14.227,00:08:19.232
not end up using it. I will,
ahm- the off the shelf
frameworks er- so there’s a L

00:08:22.435,00:08:28.308
-eh- a -uh Github repo ahm with
a name ALPR dash unconstrained
that’s the one where I looked

00:08:28.308,00:08:35.248
through a few and just right -a
right out of the box it was able
to classify ahm correctly half

00:08:35.248,00:08:40.253
of the, the license plate images
that I gave to it. So that was
huge. And you can- you can,

00:08:42.722,00:08:49.362
modify or fine tune this setup
with those labeled images. So I
will be making use of any

00:08:49.362,00:08:54.367
manually labelled ahm- ahm- you
know- training ah- images. But
the short story, the short

00:08:57.103,00:09:03.309
version is that, I’m not a some
expert in AI, I took off the
shelf tools that are freely

00:09:03.309,00:09:08.314
available online and just
knowing Nest or Ring Cameras
that have facial recognition,

00:09:10.650,00:09:15.255
there are faciu- facial
recognition software and open
source software out there is

00:09:15.255,00:09:21.628
becoming a lot easier to use and
I know there’s a license plate
recognition software out there

00:09:21.628,00:09:26.633
as well and just putting the
two- two and two together. Let
me get a drink of water. So,

00:09:33.640,00:09:40.180
I’m- I’m using ahm YOLO V three
which is based off Darknet to
run the ahm- the license plate

00:09:40.180,00:09:45.185
ahm- detection and then I’m
using face net for the ahm
facial recognition ahm-

00:09:47.353,00:09:53.927
features. With the devices I’m
gonna get to, next, I’m making
use of tensor RT which is a way

00:09:53.927,00:09:59.566
to use TensorFlow on these ehm-
video devices so they run super
fast. And again, this

00:09:59.566,00:10:06.573
potentially will change, I’m
just gonna be fine tuning
testing if you submit a poor

00:10:06.573,00:10:13.546
quest in its just better than we
would implement. Here are the
hardware options, now this ahm-

00:10:13.546,00:10:19.285
one of the things that
originally inspire this was
github repo that was a, that’s a

00:10:19.285,00:10:24.290
Tesla USB basically a-a- a guy
took a pi zero W and- and- and
uhm- modify or scribed it so

00:10:27.861,00:10:34.367
that the Tesla, which treated as
a flash drive ah and so when you
pull then to your garage at home

00:10:34.367,00:10:40.139
connects to the wifi you will be
able to move that video over
extremely slowly, so very happy

00:10:40.139,00:10:45.144
to move off the Pi Zero W. But
with the Pi four coming out, you
could potentially run inference

00:10:47.413,00:10:52.886
on this but really the top two
options are going to be for if
you just want to be capture all

00:10:52.886,00:10:59.292
of the video by default Tesla is
only gonna be able to, is only
gonna give you saved events

00:10:59.292,00:11:02.595
where you either have to
manually save an event by
clicking a button on the screen

00:11:02.595,00:11:08.268
or when a sentry mode event
would ahm- was detected.
Basically when an enhanced car

00:11:08.268,00:11:12.705
alarm would would go off that’s
when you get an event. Quite a
few false positives in there as

00:11:12.705,00:11:19.178
well. Ahm- but, you’d use either
of these top options if you want
to save all of that video. So,

00:11:19.178,00:11:26.085
the- the bottomline two options
are the Jetson Nano which is its
only under a hundred dollars its

00:11:26.085,00:11:32.525
extremely affordable. That’s
this one here, and the Jetson
Xavier, which is this one here,

00:11:32.525,00:11:35.662
are going to be ones you’re
gonna wanna run ah, use if
you’re running inference if you

00:11:35.662,00:11:39.766
want to be notified in real time
with the other two you’re just
gonna upload that a- video or

00:11:39.766,00:11:44.604
data to your computer, run
inference on it later. So
really, for all my testing I use

00:11:44.604,00:11:49.609
the Jetson Xavier. Ah- as far as
the benchmarks, the Xavier is
gonna be almost double as fast

00:11:52.278,00:11:55.848
now is definitely double the
price but seven hundred dollars,
I think is still affordable

00:11:55.848,00:12:01.588
especially if. I just think its
,I just think its, worth it. But
a- you’re gonna get things, its

00:12:01.588,00:12:05.425
not, its not really gonna be
real time if you go with the
Jetson Nano, so if you want real

00:12:05.425,00:12:10.663
time you, you need to go with
the Xavier. And again I expect
these uhm- fps benchmarks to ah-

00:12:10.663,00:12:15.668
to change as well. Alright let’s
get to the demo. Okay, so ,
here’s basically the recently

00:12:23.810,00:12:29.048
detected dashboard. This is when
you, what you, what you see
first in. As you can see, a lot

00:12:29.048,00:12:32.885
of plate detector this is a very
small sample but a lot of plate
are detected in them in a very

00:12:32.885,00:12:38.691
short amount of time. And you
can search by the car make or
model which is pretty cool, but

00:12:38.691,00:12:41.861
this isn’t really gonna help
tell you if you’re being
followed. You can’t really make

00:12:41.861,00:12:45.698
use of the data in this way so.
We can click to on all detected
plates, those are fake license

00:12:45.698,00:12:50.169
plates by the way, and click on
detected plates and now we can
start make better use of these

00:12:50.169,00:12:53.873
plates and now we can start to
make better use of the data, we
can really study the data here

00:12:53.873,00:12:59.012
uhm. At the top, you’ll see this
link to friend, basically we are
able to tag something as a

00:12:59.012,00:13:02.982
benign finding. Uhm- if we
notice like maybe, we, we’re
looking at the video later

00:13:02.982,00:13:06.486
maybe, we now think its a, its a
coworking neighbor friend
something like that. You know

00:13:06.486,00:13:11.491
why is this high risk with only
four detections down here. Well
if you wanna see a ahm- a video

00:13:13.626,00:13:18.631
of the real time, live, in car
notification, there’s a wired
article and or just youtube

00:13:21.901,00:13:26.906
video that I’m just gonna post
that will have a link to that
video. So basically you’re able

00:13:30.777,00:13:33.980
to set your settings on your
notifications you’re able to set
your thresholds do I want to be

00:13:33.980,00:13:39.452
notified when a car is detected
x number of times in x number of
minutes do I want to be notified

00:13:39.452,00:13:44.991
when the, vehicle, the same
vehicle is detected over a
number of days, ah- maybe within

00:13:44.991,00:13:49.395
a geographical area and the
outside of that geographical
area. That’s what you ca- what

00:13:49.395,00:13:55.234
you can do from a threshold
perspective and that’s why this
high risk rating is here when

00:13:55.234,00:14:01.741
there where only four detections
its because I had set something
up to where if a car is seen,

00:14:01.741,00:14:07.847
the same car is seen over four
days ah- over four days like you
know if its seen everyday over

00:14:07.847,00:14:12.852
four days let me know,
essentially. And it was. We’re
gonna go on the next part here.

00:14:19.392,00:14:24.564
So we can click in this range
rover to figure out what the
deal is, we, we know an alert

00:14:24.564,00:14:27.867
was triggered and I wanna know
why. You can turn on satellite
mode if it makes it easier to

00:14:27.867,00:14:32.739
see. Basically here we see in
the search bar that we search
this license plate, the place

00:14:32.739,00:14:37.443
marker is gonna show the photos
of the actual ah- detection took
place. We can click into one and

00:14:37.443,00:14:41.013
we can see at the time at this
detection took place, the speed
we we’re going the power usage

00:14:41.013,00:14:46.018
of the car, what gear we’re in
and we can click into play video
if we want a- to a- be back on

00:14:49.489,00:14:54.761
time to when is this actually
incurred. On the bottom left you
see the car driving by, that’s

00:14:54.761,00:14:59.766
the front camera there in the
middle, and we can fast forward
a few seconds here. And now we

00:15:02.168,00:15:08.508
can see in real time how fast we
are going along with this video
and with along with this ahm the

00:15:08.508,00:15:13.212
place marker map data so out
put. You were able to get it
together in a really cool way

00:15:13.212,00:15:20.186
ah- that’s makes it useful. Ahm-
to, to examine. Now let’s see
what’s next here, so we’re gonna

00:15:20.186,00:15:25.591
get into the ahm- face
detection. Essentially we know
that this is a male late

00:15:25.591,00:15:32.064
twenties is the same male, we’re
able to click or unclick, we are
able to train the model

00:15:32.064,00:15:38.004
basically, you see the video of
the detection. This is very
similar with a Nest camera or

00:15:38.004,00:15:42.975
Ring camera if you’re familiar
with. Fill out the name of this
person, save it. And now we can

00:15:42.975,00:15:49.949
search for this person’s name
and we see Truman has been
detected. Snooping around my

00:15:49.949,00:15:54.954
car. And that is essentially it
for the demo. [applause] So
what’s next. Remote live view

00:16:08.901,00:16:13.573
again this is gonna come down to
the whole real time thing I’m
try- I’m working on a way to

00:16:13.573,00:16:17.376
start running inferences on
those frames as being written to
them before if anyone want to

00:16:17.376,00:16:20.446
help with that that would be
awesome, that would be greatly
appreciated but that would take

00:16:20.446,00:16:23.382
you down. It will take you from
zero to sixty seconds if you’re
waiting to start the inference

00:16:23.382,00:16:29.856
to rest soon as the the frame is
written essentially. Third party
dashcams are another, well its

00:16:29.856,00:16:35.061
not much of a natural fit so its
uh- its not gonna be uh- super
high priority but I could

00:16:35.061,00:16:38.564
definitely see why people want
to make use of the software side
of this. Gait recognition is

00:16:38.564,00:16:43.569
something that I think is really
cool and we just add just from
it because its interesting. I

00:16:43.569,00:16:47.240
would like to point that and ah-
more objects to actually might
have seen that little button of

00:16:47.240,00:16:53.913
filter there which is for pets.
I took aie- I took oh- google
open images uh- data set and I

00:16:53.913,00:17:00.152
made it only see license plates.
So, so it will be faster. So I
removed, thousands of different

00:17:00.152,00:17:05.358
objects that already could have
been detected there and I just
thought it would be interesting

00:17:05.358,00:17:12.164
when I was you know, starting
with this project. Like what,
just to see okay, cat, black

00:17:12.164,00:17:16.536
cat, how many black cats has my
car seen like you can do that
with any object in any of these

00:17:16.536,00:17:21.307
data sets, it’s just really
interesting to me that you can
make use of the data that way.

00:17:21.307,00:17:25.545
And then your request here your
submit or request your issue
with if- if you think on a- on

00:17:25.545,00:17:29.548
Github if you think something
else should be added. I wish I
can spend more time on the

00:17:29.548,00:17:35.555
privacy implications of this
haha but basically Teslas are
out there there are a lot of

00:17:35.555,00:17:39.692
cars that are starting to
implement self driving ffe-
features and uhm- almost all of

00:17:39.692,00:17:44.964
them are making use of cameras I
mean, essentially, the amount of
cameras out on the road is just

00:17:44.964,00:17:50.369
exponentially increase, very
very quickly, uhm- private
corporations and governments are

00:17:50.369,00:17:53.906
gonna wanna make use of this
data, insurance companies,
everyone is gonna want this data

00:17:53.906,00:17:59.979
uhm- market research firms, so
if you think about breaches in
the next few years, I, I feel

00:17:59.979,00:18:04.116
like a lot of them are going to
include these type of data.
Because it I- I- think its gonna

00:18:04.116,00:18:10.389
be extremely valuable. And a-
that’s it. Thank you very much
[applause] you can check out the

00:18:10.389,00:18:15.428
link there if you want to see
the code. Uh- the build
materials is on there now, the

00:18:15.428,00:18:20.433
code uhm- for all of this is
gonna be added later today.
Thank you very much, thanks.

00:18:23.269,00:18:26.872
[applause]
