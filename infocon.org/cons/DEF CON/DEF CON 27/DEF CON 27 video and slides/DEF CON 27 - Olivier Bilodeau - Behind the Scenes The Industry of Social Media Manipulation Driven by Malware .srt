00:00:00.000,00:00:05.005
>>Let’s get going. >>Yeah, so
with no further ado, I give you
your speakers. >>Good Ok.

00:00:14.214,00:00:16.383
[applause] [inaudible mumbling
off mic] >>Hello everybody,
thank you for coming at our

00:00:16.383,00:00:20.420
session. Um I’m Masarah
Paquet-Clouston. This is Olivier
Bilodeau, we’re both from

00:00:20.420,00:00:24.791
GoSecure Research in Montreal.
And we’re gonna talk about
behind the scenes, the industry

00:00:24.791,00:00:29.930
of social man- media
manipulation driven by malware.
We have a lot of content, so

00:00:29.930,00:00:36.370
we’re just gonna dive right away
into it. So this is a 4 year
long investigation and it

00:00:36.370,00:00:41.375
started in 2015. At that time
Olivier was working at ESET with
Thomas Dupuy and they were both

00:00:43.944,00:00:48.782
working on a malware called
Linux/Moose that was using
infected devices to proxy

00:00:48.782,00:00:55.489
traffic and go to social media
sites. Then I came in and he
switched jobs to GoSecure and I

00:00:55.489,00:01:00.394
came in as an intern and we were
looking for research project to
do all together. And that is

00:01:00.394,00:01:06.466
that is when ESET shared to us a
second version of the malware
Linux/Moose and we partnered up

00:01:06.466,00:01:11.905
with my prof at that time at the
University Prof [1:10], a the
universe- from University of

00:01:11.905,00:01:18.078
Montreal and my Mitacs which is
a non-profit organization in
Canada focused on research. And

00:01:18.078,00:01:23.951
we decided to study that second
version of Linux/Moose. First,
you must be wondering what

00:01:23.951,00:01:29.623
Linux/Moose mean, right? Like
what, why are we calling this
botnet it this way? Well, when

00:01:29.623,00:01:34.761
Olivier was studying that botnet
in 2015 they found in the
binaries the string elan and

00:01:34.761,00:01:40.767
elan is moose in French and
since we’re Canadians, they
wanted it to give that botnet a

00:01:40.767,00:01:45.939
Canadian touch. Although
probably these guys are not
Canadian or we don’t know and

00:01:45.939,00:01:50.777
that is why they called it Linux
because it’s targeting Linux
embedded systems and Moose for

00:01:50.777,00:01:57.150
the string. Linux/Moose is an
IoT botnet that conducts social
media manipulation. What is

00:01:57.150,00:02:02.122
social media manipulation? Where
basically its just the process
of creating fake accounts online

00:02:02.122,00:02:07.427
and then using them to go and
like and follow other people. We
have a good story of an example

00:02:07.427,00:02:12.699
of social media manipulation uh
that was done by a journalist in
Quebec called Emil- Emilie

00:02:12.699,00:02:18.238
Bilodeau. So she decided for her
investigation to become an
influencer by cheating, so what

00:02:18.238,00:02:22.809
she did is she created that fake
account called the pretty runner
and started to take pictures of

00:02:22.809,00:02:29.149
herself running. And then she
used various techniques to
increase her following online

00:02:29.149,00:02:34.154
and we met with her uh after she
published and she told us what
she did, so she did follow,

00:02:34.154,00:02:39.226
unfollow, unlike for like, she
also joined pods of influencers
that liked each other to give

00:02:39.226,00:02:44.765
themselves more visibility and
she said that she had to bot
fake followers to give her some

00:02:44.765,00:02:48.635
sort of a base of visibility so
once you have like 10,000
followers, then you’re more

00:02:48.635,00:02:52.439
credible and then afterwards you
start and you try to these
different techniques I just

00:02:52.439,00:02:57.644
mentioned. Today what we’re
going to focus is on this
technique, buying fake likes and

00:02:57.644,00:03:03.150
follows, so it’s the process of
creating follows and then
selling them so influencers can

00:03:03.150,00:03:08.155
get popular uh with fake
visibility. So this presentation
basically is based on its it

00:03:10.257,00:03:14.761
aims at sort of mapping the
ecosystem of social media
manipulation its a four year

00:03:14.761,00:03:19.699
long investigation that started
in 2015 uh it uses various
investigative techniques. So we

00:03:19.699,00:03:24.738
did traffic analysis, reverse
engineering uh we also went on
forums. To sort of understand

00:03:24.738,00:03:29.042
what was going on with these
actors and what they were
talking about and we sort of

00:03:29.042,00:03:34.147
create that map of all the
actors that are involved and the
ground basis is Linux/Moose.

00:03:34.147,00:03:39.986
Which is what Olivier’s going to
start with. >>Yeah, so uh again
like Linux/Moose has been

00:03:39.986,00:03:45.525
something we talked about for
awhile uh its an IoT botnet. Now
let’s map it into our ecosystem.

00:03:45.525,00:03:52.065
So it’s, its fits right in the
ground you know far away from
social media cause it’s only

00:03:52.065,00:03:58.338
proxying traffic to them. Uh
we’ll see that, you’ll see that
map evolve as our talk goes on.

00:03:58.338,00:04:03.710
Uh so basically Linux/Moose we
say routers and Internet of
Things what we mean by that is

00:04:03.710,00:04:09.483
embedded Linux systems with a
busybox userland. So its a
subset of an of IoT, but it’s

00:04:09.483,00:04:15.755
still clearly a big subset of
it. It has a worm-like behavior
so it it does its spread through

00:04:15.755,00:04:20.427
creden- uh telnet credential
brute forcing and its main
payload or the the reason why it

00:04:20.427,00:04:26.099
does social media manipulation
is its offering a proxy service,
which means that it leverages

00:04:26.099,00:04:31.104
the the IP repu- repute table IP
of people who are infected. So
ISP IPs are more you know

00:04:33.640,00:04:39.846
credible to Instagram or social
net work than data center or
enterprise IP space. So the the

00:04:39.846,00:04:46.286
the proxy is a good way for the
malware uh operators to kind of
you know separate themselves

00:04:46.286,00:04:52.993
from uh the intent is not clear
in the malware itself because
its only a proxy service, you

00:04:52.993,00:04:58.398
need to detonate the malware and
look uh what its doing to get an
understanding of what the bad

00:04:58.398,00:05:03.336
guys are after. Classic malware
uh technique of deception. Um in
order to to uh catch it and I’m

00:05:05.872,00:05:09.476
going to really go quickly
through this cause we have a lot
of content, but we deployed

00:05:09.476,00:05:14.648
custom honeypots. They were
basically like one side an ARM
virtual machine where we could

00:05:14.648,00:05:20.921
run or detonate the real malware
uh on the other side we had the
fake uh frontend that would look

00:05:20.921,00:05:27.060
like uh IoT or router in our
case. Uh so we kind of did both
so that if the operator scanned

00:05:27.060,00:05:33.200
us he would think that he’s that
this is legit infected device.
We deployed them all over the

00:05:33.200,00:05:38.705
world and uh it yielded nothing,
it cost me money and it was time
consuming cause it didn’t change

00:05:38.705,00:05:45.445
anything. We did this uh uh an
HTTPS Man-in-the Middle cause
all that traffic was HTTPS. And

00:05:45.445,00:05:51.785
so we uh we we we uh we
redirected the flows to um an
MITM proxy uh project which is

00:05:51.785,00:05:56.790
an amazing project uh for that
kind of work. Cause of that work
uh they do good raw lugs uh of

00:05:59.426,00:06:04.731
the HTTP traffic once you break
the HTTPS. And what this slide
is about, like we didn’t break

00:06:04.731,00:06:07.567
or invent a new technique to
break HTTPs. The thing is we
anticipated or expected that

00:06:07.567,00:06:12.572
they would uh ignore uh
certificate errors, which they
did. So we were kind of like

00:06:17.577,00:06:23.383
glad about it. And so at that
point we had the raw traffic.
We’re really nice and so Masarah

00:06:23.383,00:06:28.388
what did we do with the raw
traffic. >>Yes, so at that time
when we were studying we had was

00:06:28.388,00:06:34.261
several infected hosts used by
operators, HTTPS traffic in
plain text. Yay. And C and C

00:06:34.261,00:06:40.166
traffic and publicly available
seller market. So that is when
we presented in 2016 at BlackHat

00:06:40.166,00:06:44.404
Europe in London. And we’re not
going to go more into details of
the analysis that we done there,

00:06:44.404,00:06:49.509
because there’s documents there
that are published online that
describes everything. But

00:06:49.509,00:06:53.446
there’s one thing that we hadn’t
talked about at that
presentation that sort of led

00:06:53.446,00:06:58.785
this presentation. And its a
feature that was within the
infrastructure of Linux/Moose.

00:06:58.785,00:07:05.458
So Linux/Moose had 7 whitelisted
IP and we say whitelisted
because these were IP that had

00:07:05.458,00:07:10.196
the right to use the botnet. So
they had the right to push
requests through to infected

00:07:10.196,00:07:16.770
devices onto social networks. So
at that time when we noticed
that, we were like hmm, what are

00:07:16.770,00:07:21.908
these whitelisted IPs for?
Right. So our hypothesis was to
think that it was a reseller

00:07:21.908,00:07:26.746
model. So that one whitelisted
IP that was just you know a
server somewhere that had access

00:07:26.746,00:07:31.484
to the botnet could have been I
don’t know, sellers of Twitter
fake followers and you know when

00:07:31.484,00:07:36.056
they would sell it they would
just connect to that IP and push
the request through the botnet.

00:07:36.056,00:07:42.295
So we thought that uh well we we
wanted to find out what these
IPs were meant for. So we

00:07:42.295,00:07:48.301
decided to conduct several
traffic analysis. So we used
Jupyterlab. Its an awesome open

00:07:48.301,00:07:53.740
source tool that allows you to
sort of pcap data along with
proxy logs, like correlate them

00:07:53.740,00:07:57.811
together and just use them for
data frames and graphic. And we
sort of developed that

00:07:57.811,00:08:01.114
methodology of various variables
that could have help us
understand what these

00:08:01.114,00:08:06.519
whitelisted IPs were meant for.
So we looked at honeypots used,
uh per whitelisted IP, we looked

00:08:06.519,00:08:11.324
at websites targeted, TLS
fingerprints, but all of these
didn’t yield anything. It was a

00:08:11.324,00:08:16.329
lot of analysis for few
findings. Except from two. So
two um variables told us what it

00:08:18.465,00:08:23.002
was. It was acc-, so the
variables were account created
on social networks and accounts

00:08:23.002,00:08:29.342
followed on social networks. So
basically for each whitelisted
IP we had uh we could find that

00:08:29.342,00:08:34.514
it had their own lists of fake
account, but they were actually
all following the same accounts.

00:08:34.514,00:08:40.687
So the potential buyers that we
call. So we sort of figured out
that these IPs, these servers

00:08:40.687,00:08:46.960
meant for fake account
management. So where do we
stand, right? At that moment.

00:08:46.960,00:08:50.964
Well, we knew that each
whitelisted IP addresses have
their own list of fake accounts

00:08:50.964,00:08:55.468
and that was the meant, that was
why they were there. And
additionally what we did was we

00:08:55.468,00:08:59.706
scanned them and we saw that
they were running Windows
servers and uh that they we

00:08:59.706,00:09:04.544
talked to somebody at OVH who
confirmed to us that they were
using uh remote desktop protocol

00:09:04.544,00:09:09.149
was actively used. So we
wondered, right, what kind of
piece of infrastructure could

00:09:09.149,00:09:14.721
glue all of this together? So
you have Windows servers, RDP
open so people connecting and we

00:09:14.721,00:09:20.660
know that they’re managing fake
accounts. And that’s when
automation software appeared.

00:09:20.660,00:09:27.333
>>And so uh automation software
is uh like we we started looking
at it like what would fill that

00:09:27.333,00:09:31.905
gap, right? And we found out
about software that exists that
kind of turns social media

00:09:31.905,00:09:36.709
around and the fact that what
you’re looking at when you use
such software is you have a grid

00:09:36.709,00:09:41.681
layout. You have like th- an
Excel spreadsheet. Where your
fake accounts are there, and

00:09:41.681,00:09:46.119
you, they’re mapped to a proxy
and we’re gonna go through this
and you’re gonna see this. But

00:09:46.119,00:09:51.057
now I just wanted you to have an
image in your head and we’re
gonna map it to our ecosystem.

00:09:51.057,00:09:57.330
Which we love by the way. So its
in the tree, near the moose,
because automation software uh

00:09:57.330,00:10:01.868
enables uh the moose which is
the you know the pro- basically
a a botnet of proxies that it

00:10:01.868,00:10:06.873
will leverage. Um, so we try to
find uh the software that would
be powering a Linux/Moose and we

00:10:09.275,00:10:16.182
base this research on
user-agents. So both, they were
both using the the fake accounts

00:10:16.182,00:10:22.021
and the interaction with
Instagram were both using mobile
and desktop user-agents. And we

00:10:22.021,00:10:27.026
uh the although Linux/Moose
supported many proxying
mechanism, we uh, we knew or we

00:10:29.295,00:10:34.300
saw that socks proxying was the
one that was used. And so uh we
found different features uh from

00:10:37.270,00:10:42.275
these vendors uh ska- uh you
know do they manage thousands of
accounts or a few accounts,

00:10:44.644,00:10:49.849
proxy-type usage and can you
customize uh uh browsing
patterns and all that that

00:10:49.849,00:10:54.854
stuff. Uh and also we found
different business models. So
they all charge money for their

00:10:54.854,00:10:59.926
software. By the way their
software is heavily protected.
As we as you’ll see. Uh some of

00:10:59.926,00:11:04.030
them supported the unlimited
accounts, some of them you would
pay with one time fee, et

00:11:04.030,00:11:09.802
cetera. Uh the first one we
looked at was Gram Dominator, so
uh Gram Dominator and all the

00:11:09.802,00:11:15.742
Dominator names are like very
common, they have a so- for
everything. And so you know

00:11:15.742,00:11:20.747
legitimately, you can pay with a
normal credit card. This is
really foreign for me a- as a

00:11:20.747,00:11:25.718
malware researcher where
everything is like bitcoins or
you know really shady or hidden.

00:11:25.718,00:11:29.756
All of the social media stuff is
still like paypal accounts, they
probably d- e- ch- they probably

00:11:29.756,00:11:34.894
declare taxes and all that
stuff. Which makes it more like
interesting and at the same

00:11:34.894,00:11:38.364
time, sad and you know. We
should do something about it.
Uh, but uh it has a the features

00:11:38.364,00:11:42.135
that we needed here. Here we
highlighted like proxy support
which, in which they mention

00:11:42.135,00:11:47.140
public, private, socket you- you
these are clearly not you know
that technical but anyway. Uh,

00:11:51.077,00:11:57.050
they uh also s- uh support
several instagram accounts. So
diving into the binary I was

00:11:57.050,00:12:02.121
looking for user user agent
strings. Right. And so I di- I
found that they were using, they

00:12:02.121,00:12:07.393
were generating user agents uh
on the fly. And so looking at
the code, they were really

00:12:07.393,00:12:14.133
combining like Android versions,
dpi resolution and this is
exactly like what instagram

00:12:14.133,00:12:19.305
looks like fr- from when you use
the Android app. So they mimic
that portion, but with a

00:12:19.305,00:12:24.243
generator so that you would, a
single fake account would get
its user agent. This would be

00:12:24.243,00:12:30.550
put into a database and and then
for that fake account always the
same user agent would be reused.

00:12:30.550,00:12:35.622
So we found like another pretty
clever. And so we looked at it
uh through powershell, we kind

00:12:35.622,00:12:40.994
of you know loaded the library
and asked a few names to see
what it looked like. And this

00:12:40.994,00:12:47.634
was really similar to what we
saw, uh, from Linux/Moose. Uh
let’s look at another one. So

00:12:47.634,00:12:53.573
Social Dominator which is again
under the umbrella of the
Dominator uh trademark. And uh

00:12:53.573,00:13:00.079
what uh what I want to highlight
here is like that grid layout.
Like this we only have one

00:13:00.079,00:13:05.385
account, but uh its because it
was our own and we didn’t have
many accounts to put in there

00:13:05.385,00:13:10.957
for this screenshot. But so you
see that the like username,
proxy and then and it will

00:13:10.957,00:13:15.862
gather the friendship count and
stuff like that. You de- you
also have like uh import

00:13:15.862,00:13:20.233
capabilities, export
capabilities, so its really
meant for scaling. Uh and you

00:13:20.233,00:13:25.238
have a log of everything that’s
going on uh at at down. Uh this
software supports like Reddit,

00:13:27.540,00:13:32.412
Tumblr, Facebook, Instagram,
Twitter, Pinterest, Cobra and
even Google Plus. RIP Google

00:13:32.412,00:13:38.551
Plus. [laughter] But so you know
you see that they’re into this
business for for for real. Eh- I

00:13:38.551,00:13:42.655
think this one uses the Chrome
embedded framework. A lot of
them use Chrome embedded

00:13:42.655,00:13:44.991
framework. We have a little uh
table that was summarized all we
found about the different

00:13:44.991,00:13:51.798
software that we analyzed. Uh
I’m going to go really quickly
through it cause we have lot of

00:13:51.798,00:13:56.536
stuff to cover, but you’ll be
able to get the slides and look
at the at the table on your own

00:13:56.536,00:14:02.275
time. The other one that me-
that is interesting and needs uh
you know cause it’s kind of a

00:14:02.275,00:14:08.948
story in its own. Is Follow
Liker. So Follow Liker uses a
weird discontinual packer called

00:14:08.948,00:14:13.953
Jet. It eh uh, Jet compiles Java
into native code. But still uses
a JIT engine so we have like a

00:14:18.291,00:14:25.064
hundred ya know, or thousand of
function and then a big data
block and when you like at it,

00:14:25.064,00:14:29.569
its binary and its loaded by the
thing. So its really hard to
reverse engineer. Uh when I

00:14:29.569,00:14:34.574
loaded it in Ida Pro, it gave it
gave me 267 megabyte of native
code and I was like, oh my God,

00:14:36.642,00:14:41.681
there’s no way I can go through
this, but the packer costs
something. Do bad guys pay for

00:14:41.681,00:14:47.286
packer? Of course not, right?
And so when you you you try to
use the software without the

00:14:47.286,00:14:52.658
launcher, you get an error like
its an evaluation version and
expired. So when I looked at the

00:14:52.658,00:14:57.396
in the strings I see that they
packed it with an evaluation
version that was valid for 3

00:14:57.396,00:15:03.202
months. Right? And so I was like
ok but, why when I use the
launcher, this thing works? It’s

00:15:03.202,00:15:08.207
because they embedded in it and
they UPX packed it, the
runasdate, uh program, so what

00:15:10.543,00:15:16.916
they basically the launcher does
is it’s it’s unpacking or
loading uh, uh runasdate and

00:15:16.916,00:15:23.055
then param- giving ya like
inputs to fake the date, but
only for that process, so your

00:15:23.055,00:15:29.028
operating system and everything
is ok, right. And so this
completely bypasses the jet uh

00:15:29.028,00:15:34.300
limitations that they can use
evaluation version. I found that
really funny, but I lost a bunch

00:15:34.300,00:15:40.373
of time looking at it. And so
this gave us uh Follow Liker
running, but its still like the

00:15:40.373,00:15:43.276
same grid layout, nothing new,
nothing learned, so yeah. Too
bad. Uh so we looked at many of

00:15:43.276,00:15:45.278
them, we cut them for these
slides. But uh here’s the table
that I mentioned earlier. But

00:15:45.278,00:15:47.280
the the jist of it is we didn’t
find the one for Linux/Moose. No
there was always something off

00:15:47.280,00:15:50.483
and so eventually we hope that
we might be able to fi- find it.
And by the way, like, all the

00:15:50.483,00:15:52.485
binaries I found, I uh we have a
you know a company account for
virus total. I put in the domain

00:15:52.485,00:15:54.487
name of the of this business in
virus total and I was able to
download the binaries and

00:15:54.487,00:15:56.489
analyze them. So Virus Total
thank you, you’re like a binary
distributor and this is really

00:15:56.489,00:15:58.491
good cause otherwise we couldn’t
have those binaries. So now
where do where do we stand? We

00:15:58.491,00:16:00.426
found several automation
software vendors which we
analyze. The reseller model

00:16:00.426,00:16:02.428
clearly now is not at the botnet
level through the analysis that
Masarah told us about earlier.

00:16:02.428,00:16:04.430
So where is the reseller model?
This what we’re looking for. So
Masarah. >>Yes. Ok so at that

00:16:04.430,00:16:06.432
time when I was investigation
the the decrypted traffic, I was
trying to find um in the traffic

00:16:06.432,00:16:08.434
some accounts that would for
example, an Instagram account
that would advertise follows and

00:16:08.434,00:16:10.436
likes. So in that case I would
be able to say oh see that
account was followed by our

00:16:10.436,00:16:15.441
botnet and its advertising
selling a fake likes and follows
so that must be a our botnet

00:16:23.449,00:16:28.454
providers or something like
that, right? So I started to
investigate a traffic and I was

00:16:59.952,00:17:04.891
looking for keywords like social
media, panel and all that and I
ended up finding reseller

00:17:13.499,00:17:19.005
panels. Just like this one
called medianesia panel. So
reseller panels are basically

00:17:19.005,00:17:24.877
just panels that sell fake likes
and follows in bulk. When I told
the de- when I told this to the

00:17:24.877,00:17:28.648
journalist, she was really made
because she paid a high price
for the fake follows that she

00:17:28.648,00:17:32.919
bought, but she could have then
had them at a very lowest price.
If she would have gone through

00:17:32.919,00:17:38.824
the reseller panels. So we sort
of uh decided to illustrate them
as spiders and webs and where

00:17:38.824,00:17:43.162
they are in the ecosystem is
just a little bit above the
automation software. And next

00:17:43.162,00:17:48.601
our Linux/Moose our IoT botnet.
So reseller panels look a little
bit like that. So just you can

00:17:48.601,00:17:53.306
login with a fake account easily
and just create a password and
they all sell fake likes and

00:17:53.306,00:17:58.144
follows in bulk and most of them
offer the services on all social
networks. So Twitter, Facebook,

00:17:58.144,00:18:03.649
Instagram. What’s interesting
are the prices are lower than
other sellers that we’re going

00:18:03.649,00:18:09.956
to see later, but the lower you
go and the more the shadier the
payment process is. So I tried

00:18:09.956,00:18:15.761
about to buy a million followers
for myself for my fake account.
At 1 point 8 dollars for poro-

00:18:15.761,00:18:20.166
for 10,000 dollars and the only
way I could actually pay for
that was bitcoin, so its kind of

00:18:20.166,00:18:26.973
interesting because as the price
goes down, the payment methods
become more and more shadier. So

00:18:26.973,00:18:30.042
what was specific about the
reseller panel that was
interesting is the fact that

00:18:30.042,00:18:34.313
they were selling popularity in
bulk, but also that they all
look alike. So when I was

00:18:34.313,00:18:38.551
investigating them, starting to
look at them, it was like oh, it
looks like its the same group

00:18:38.551,00:18:44.624
behind these panels, because I
mean, it just seems like to be
coded by the same person. So

00:18:44.624,00:18:49.795
with that simple investigation,
we gathered information on 343
reseller panels and we gathered

00:18:49.795,00:18:54.700
information on the fingerprint
of the web application, domain
registration information, html

00:18:54.700,00:18:59.472
content and IP address. And we
started to do clustering
analysis. Like it did yield some

00:18:59.472,00:19:02.875
results, but there was just one
big result that we couldn’t
ignore and it’s the fact that

00:19:02.875,00:19:08.547
the it was the IP address. It’s
that the fact that 68- 6 percent
of our sample was posted on the

00:19:08.547,00:19:13.552
same IP address. So here we just
did a simple passive DNS query
uh and then we found that this

00:19:16.122,00:19:22.561
IP hosted Indian it housing
other domains and all these
domains are related to uh the

00:19:22.561,00:19:28.501
resell of SMM. Social Media
Manipulation. So for example you
have extra like, easy boost gram

00:19:28.501,00:19:35.141
panel. And why investigating
that we found a specific actor,
perfect panel dot com and what

00:19:35.141,00:19:40.880
this perfect panel does well,
it’s a panel as a service
provider. So that sort of

00:19:40.880,00:19:45.618
answers why all the reseller
panels looks the same. It’s
basically that there is a

00:19:45.618,00:19:51.190
provider that allow you to sort
of have a panel without having
any technical knowledge. So they

00:19:51.190,00:19:55.995
will provide you with the panel
and you can start reselling in
bulk. So that sort of added

00:19:55.995,00:20:01.801
another actor that we weren’t
expecting. An actor um that we
added in our little forest

00:20:01.801,00:20:06.806
behind the webs and the spiders
because they enable the reseller
panels sellers. Yeah. So

00:20:09.442,00:20:15.181
basically panel as a service, we
found five of them. Uh what they
offer is a ready to go software,

00:20:15.181,00:20:19.518
they even provide web hosting,
obviously all on the same IP
address and some of them even

00:20:19.518,00:20:24.423
include the domain names. So you
don’t even have to buy that.
They have specific features like

00:20:24.423,00:20:29.628
API to receive orders and API to
send orders, so what you could
do is just connect to a panel

00:20:29.628,00:20:33.999
and then uh to receive orders
and connect to another panel and
then just act in the middle.

00:20:33.999,00:20:38.738
They also uh allow you to track
your workers so if you wouldn’t
want to automate everything and

00:20:38.738,00:20:41.707
you were in another country
where you would want to have
workers then that would be

00:20:41.707,00:20:47.446
something possible to and you
could do it manually. So here I
just give you an example of it’s

00:20:47.446,00:20:51.484
not perfect panel, its uh
IndusRabbit, so we could
actually just login through the

00:20:51.484,00:20:55.888
demo and see that you have a
dashboard with all the user
names and the people that are

00:20:55.888,00:21:01.293
actually, that would be your
customers in your reseller
panel. You also see that you can

00:21:01.293,00:21:05.564
select an API and just like
connect your panel to another
panel so you wouldn’t have to

00:21:05.564,00:21:09.602
have a link to Linux/Moose, you
would just have to have a link
to a cheaper panel and sort of

00:21:09.602,00:21:14.640
play in the middle. So we looked
at uh so we were wondering
right, ok so there’s so many

00:21:14.640,00:21:18.811
reseller panels, but how do they
connect to Linux/Moose, right?
How these two actors are linked,

00:21:18.811,00:21:23.916
I know Linux/Moose advertises
them through the accounts, but
but that wasn’t clear to us. So

00:21:23.916,00:21:28.053
what we did is we went on
BlackHat World, this is the
forum for social media

00:21:28.053,00:21:34.660
marketing. And sort of found
lots of discussions that were
from reseller panel. Owners. And

00:21:34.660,00:21:39.064
they were looking for the main
provider. So here I give you an
example of somebody saying,

00:21:39.064,00:21:45.037
well, mostly all panels use the
same provider. The only
difference is price if anyone

00:21:45.037,00:21:49.708
knows this provider, he is
welcome to contact me privately.
So you see that’s somebody that

00:21:49.708,00:21:53.712
would have an efficient reseller
panel would actually want to
connect directly to Linux/Moose,

00:21:53.712,00:21:59.485
wouldn’t want to connect to
another panel, right? But then
this guy Dealtonmediastudio sort

00:21:59.485,00:22:03.222
of shows well how the game
plays. He says no one will
reveal the main provider, for

00:22:03.222,00:22:07.593
them he is their hidden ghost.
So it makes sense right, when
you think about it. If there’s a

00:22:07.593,00:22:13.699
malware provider a malware
author who’s actually detonating
uh Linux/Moose, that person

00:22:13.699,00:22:17.002
would probably not be interested
with dealing with all these
reseller panels right? It would

00:22:17.002,00:22:21.740
just deal with one or two t-
trusted party and then these
trusted parties would deal with

00:22:21.740,00:22:26.745
the reseller panels, right. And
SS- SSMSnab here is really well
showing this. So he says, guys

00:22:29.415,00:22:33.619
unless you sp- spending a
thousand dollars a day on SSM
panels, you don’t need to search

00:22:33.619,00:22:39.225
for the original supplier. A, he
wouldn’t be interested in your
volumes and b, you just need to

00:22:39.225,00:22:43.629
find the most reliable reseller
for the most cheap reseller and
get on with it. That would be

00:22:43.629,00:22:47.600
enough. In this market you have
to put your efforts not in
buying cheaper but in selling

00:22:47.600,00:22:54.473
more. So you do like we we sort
of concluded from that that
potentially a Linux/Moose and

00:22:54.473,00:23:00.479
these providers at the bottom
would be hiding behind a few
trusted parties. However, it

00:23:00.479,00:23:04.717
seems odd to see one main
provider, right? There should be
many ways to sort of provide

00:23:04.717,00:23:09.188
fake likes and follows and this
guy says it. He says there
cannot be one provider, they are

00:23:09.188,00:23:12.992
several and there are several
methods too and while we were
thinking about that, we found a

00:23:12.992,00:23:19.865
new method that was possible.
And that’s what Olivier is going
to present. >>And so where are

00:23:19.865,00:23:24.436
we at right now? There’s a
system of resellers and a panel
of as- as service providers and

00:23:24.436,00:23:29.341
of course there is shallow
people wanting to buy fake uh
fame, you know. We have the

00:23:29.341,00:23:34.680
automation software that can
create and c- orchestrate those
fake accounts. But then when you

00:23:34.680,00:23:41.553
try when you when the bad guys
try to you know f- uh, uh
manipulate Instagram, well, they

00:23:41.553,00:23:46.558
are getting blocked. And so,
with Linux/Moose the botnet
provided to them was repute

00:23:46.558,00:23:53.232
table, IP addresses and you know
a set of proxy a services. But
what if there was another way, a

00:23:53.232,00:24:00.072
more legal way, not breaching
CFAA. And so what we’re gonna
talk about here is there is this

00:24:00.072,00:24:05.077
ecosystem of residential proxy
providers. And so, you can work
around blocks using proxies and

00:24:07.079,00:24:11.150
there are 2 types of proxies
basically that you can find
online. There’s a datacenter

00:24:11.150,00:24:16.488
proxies, which are easy to block
because they’re all together you
know, it’s clearly labeled and

00:24:16.488,00:24:22.928
uh uh Netflix or you know
Instagram can block slash 24s
like huge amount of IP addresses

00:24:22.928,00:24:27.766
in one shot without impact. But
when you try to block
residential proxy this the story

00:24:27.766,00:24:33.505
is different right. You have- IP
addresses, they can someone can
be really legit and if you block

00:24:33.505,00:24:39.678
an IP, you might legitimate
account and false positive are
really a pain in that context,

00:24:39.678,00:24:43.949
right? You don’t want to p**s
off Kim Kardashian by blocking
her because her IP was flagged.

00:24:43.949,00:24:48.954
And so you ne- need to be really
careful. And so uh we even have
like this guy an- next gen ledz

00:24:53.092,00:24:59.064
which is a junior VIP on
BlackHat World. Who says,
basically stop using datacenter

00:24:59.064,00:25:04.002
proxies period. Right. At four
page you know comment on a on
BlackHat World and so basically

00:25:06.338,00:25:12.778
we understand what you mean Next
Gen Mister. So a new actor
enters the game basically. So we

00:25:12.778,00:25:19.385
had this botnet before, but now
we have a parallel system which
would mimic the the uh botnet uh

00:25:19.385,00:25:23.389
so you could do things
differently and its the
residential proxy services,

00:25:23.389,00:25:30.062
which we, you know present to
you as uh a cabin cause we tried
to have this thing be Canadian

00:25:30.062,00:25:36.168
somehow, cause we’re crazy about
Canada. And so what we have here
is a cabin sitting on the floor,

00:25:36.168,00:25:41.106
so the floor is kind of proxying
and whatever and so automation
software right beside it and

00:25:41.106,00:25:44.877
it’s on the other side of the
tree cause it’s parallel
mechanism to achieve the social

00:25:44.877,00:25:49.948
media manipulation. We- we put a
lot of thought into this we kind
of made it a bit crazy maybe.

00:25:49.948,00:25:54.953
But so um, the ones that we
looked at were high proxies uh
storm proxies uh RSocks and the

00:25:58.924,00:26:05.397
glorious Valar Solutions, which
is a Game of Throne reference
which I don’t understand, but I

00:26:05.397,00:26:10.402
appreciate nonetheless. Um, the
Valar Solution product that we
purchased was uh, called Comet

00:26:12.805,00:26:17.810
USA Static Proxies Residential
IPV6. This was a our only IPV6
uh proxy and Valar I I I d- d-

00:26:22.581,00:26:27.586
uh no I had I need to see this
later actually. Anyway, and we
looked at li- Luminati. Luminati

00:26:29.721,00:26:36.395
is very different an a it it
needs a bit of of your attention
and its kind of side tracked

00:26:36.395,00:26:41.400
from what we’re doing today, but
this scary as h**l. But Luminati
is use case has clearly says

00:26:43.902,00:26:50.442
that account management is part
of what they’re doing. And so uh
uh here what I lay I uh

00:26:50.442,00:26:55.447
highlight here is like it
basically says, use our service
to manipulate uh social media,

00:26:58.183,00:27:03.055
right? But what I, what I want
to highlight right now is like
their business model. Cause its

00:27:03.055,00:27:08.427
completely different than the
other ones. And let me like the
have a video about it. And let

00:27:08.427,00:27:15.000
me show you. This is completely
crazy. >>Add revenue without

Join Luminati’s developer
community today. >>This
completely crazy and should be

00:28:31.376,00:28:36.381
illegal right? [laughter] Oh I
mean it it’s true like th- this
is crazy, but people will opt in

00:28:41.053,00:28:47.693
and since people agreed then its
legal, right? See it anyway I I
just can’t wrap my head around

00:28:47.693,00:28:52.698
them, but it was clear that it
was not our Linux uh it was not
uh built on compromise virtual

00:28:54.766,00:28:59.871
infrastructure so that’s why
we’re ruling them out of uh of
this presentation this research.

00:28:59.871,00:29:04.109
But still I wanted people to
spend a minute thinking about
this and you know pushing

00:29:04.109,00:29:10.449
against it, right? We need
globally to fight these business
models. Um so Trend Micro did a,

00:29:10.449,00:29:15.854
a very good paper so Luminati is
what powered HolaVPN, I don’t
know if you heard about them.

00:29:15.854,00:29:20.626
But anyway, I refer to that
paper and I I I I advise that
you look at it if you’re

00:29:20.626,00:29:25.564
interested in that topic. Uh we
we’re not gonna talk about
Luminati anymore, but I’m I’m

00:29:25.564,00:29:31.937
like mad about them. Um, so
Storm Proxies. We got IPs from
the U.S. Uh there was

00:29:31.937,00:29:37.175
conflicting information in the
in the Geo IPs and Who Is
database. I think this is how

00:29:37.175,00:29:42.547
they pull this off, uh but it
said like digital energy, Chile,
but the that hosting

00:29:42.547,00:29:49.254
organization was Host1Plus. Uh
we you had like Victoria Mahe,
which is an African ISP and that

00:29:49.254,00:29:55.394
hosting uh uh organization was
Joe’s Datacenter and even though
it should have been African when

00:29:55.394,00:30:02.334
you traceroute it, it was U.S.
And so I think this is kind of a
a you know um abusing the the

00:30:02.334,00:30:08.073
the t- the proper updates of the
the Instagram, uh not not
Instagram, but uh IP databases.

00:30:08.073,00:30:13.578
So Instagram is kind of out of
sync with these and they cannot
block, cause they’re unsure if

00:30:13.578,00:30:18.583
its ISPs or or a datacenters.
Um, this is our theory anyway.
But then we started scanning and

00:30:21.486,00:30:25.991
looking at it from uh you know
using the the the product cause
we purchased all of those

00:30:25.991,00:30:32.130
services. And so I use Squid for
proxying, they don’t protect
scans from local host uh its a

00:30:32.130,00:30:38.470
Linux system most likely Debian
Jessie because I was able when
using the proxy to scan local

00:30:38.470,00:30:43.475
hosts to fingerprint uh Exim uh
version which is an SMTP server.
And Squid and uh Debian is very

00:30:47.045,00:30:52.684
uh rigorous about you know back
porting patches, they don’t they
you know Exim for whatever

00:30:52.684,00:30:58.123
reason, they just backport the
patch themselves and so, because
of that, when you fingerprint

00:30:58.123,00:31:02.961
specific versions, you, you can
be with a high amount of
confidence know that this is a

00:31:02.961,00:31:08.767
Debian system. And so uh, this
one is a Debian. So is it
compromise infrastructure like

00:31:08.767,00:31:14.005
what we were looking for? Uh
power- cause we were looking for
criminal activity. No. So it’s

00:31:14.005,00:31:19.010
legit. Residential proxy service
legit and using geo IP who is
you know min- min- uh miss

00:31:21.480,00:31:26.485
update or you know, c- confusing
state and so uh we don’t have a
a bad guy here. Or you know we

00:31:31.389,00:31:35.260
have a gray guy. I don’t know.
Um, RSocks, it was uh, all the
IPs that we got were same subnet

00:31:35.260,00:31:40.265
in Russia. Uh it was a a packed
by the Adman LLC ISP. Adman if
you look it up, there’s nothing

00:31:44.102,00:31:48.840
so you don’t know if its
datacenter or if its a
residential ISP provider.

00:31:48.840,00:31:54.613
There’s nothing on Adman uh as
an ISP. Traceroute confirmed it
was Russia. The fact that its

00:31:54.613,00:32:01.052
all the same subnet was like,
uh, you guys are kind of lame.
But uh ok, you know. Um, they

00:32:01.052,00:32:06.057
expose SSH when you scan locally
through uh 3389 which is usually
RDP. The uh the we were not able

00:32:09.828,00:32:14.866
to fingerprint the proxy service
itself, so we don’t know what
binary, what proxy system they

00:32:14.866,00:32:19.871
were using. Uh and again,
because of the SSH that we found
and the SSH banner is gives all

00:32:22.240,00:32:28.280
the information. So we know its
a again a Debian Jessie. So
again to our, you know original

00:32:28.280,00:32:33.618
inquiry, is this compromised
infrastructure? Most likely not.
And what I failed to mention so

00:32:33.618,00:32:38.857
far is that this is not single
IPs. This is several IPs. We
analyze 5, 10 proxies and

00:32:38.857,00:32:43.361
they’re all the same, so it
cannot gives you like the sense
that it’s not compromised

00:32:43.361,00:32:48.834
infrastructure. And now lets
look at Valar solution.
Unfortunately they don’t provide

00:32:48.834,00:32:53.839
um, uh management accounts so
this screenshot is just the
glorious webpage. Uh, but the IP

00:32:57.309,00:33:02.247
we receive was a Dedibox uh IP
which is a a a i- clearly not
residential in France. It’s like

00:33:05.650,00:33:10.655
uh dedicated uh servers. Uh but
the this is the first provider
where the the traffic was not

00:33:13.091,00:33:17.262
going out from the same IP that
you connected, but it was a
tunnel. So it would, you would

00:33:17.262,00:33:22.400
connect in France and you would
get out in the U.S. You would
connect IPv4 and you would get

00:33:22.400,00:33:29.007
out IPv6 and so it was a a bit
different to analyze. The the
the outgoing traffic was labeled

00:33:29.007,00:33:34.012
uh from a AT&T internet
services. So was probably one of
the best one like a solid AT&T

00:33:36.281,00:33:43.154
no confusion whatsoever. Uh, so
uh good job. Uh Valar Solutions.
I don’t know how you pull it

00:33:43.154,00:33:48.159
off. Um we we geo IPed the the
information and this gave us a
middle of a lake in Kansas. So

00:33:51.463,00:33:58.236
at at the time I was like oh
that’s cute, I I imagine a
datacenter on the water

00:33:58.236,00:34:02.874
datacenter. But I know it’s
b******t. I know geo IP is not
precise and there’s a radius you

00:34:02.874,00:34:07.746
know involved. But I I kind of
liked it. But then that vision
was destroyed when we presented

00:34:07.746,00:34:14.319
at BlackHat two days ago. They
told me like any IP in the U.S.
not properly geo IPed or labeled

00:34:14.319,00:34:19.324
is in that lake in Kansas. And
so I was like, ok. [laughter] I
got it wrong. There’s a story

00:34:23.895,00:34:30.235
about that late- I mean wou-
wou- we should do a lightning
talk about it anyway. Uh I’m

00:34:30.235,00:34:34.172
going to skip through it cause
we have a lot of stuff to say.
But uh, so Valar uses 3proxy.

00:34:34.172,00:34:39.177
3proxy is a very famous Russian
uh uh proxy service that is kind
of shady, but its open source.

00:34:42.647,00:34:47.118
You can use it, like pen testers
should use it cause its really
flexible. But its still like, I

00:34:47.118,00:34:52.357
see- I’ve seen it before in
malware, but it still it legit
but you know. So it they they

00:34:52.357,00:34:58.897
clearly uh proxy a lot of stuff
on the same uh- en- entry IP.
Cause they had a thousand cont-

00:34:58.897,00:35:04.436
continuous port exposed entry
proxy. Uh we uh we identified it
both by nmap and by triggering

00:35:04.436,00:35:08.306
errors and looking at the error
strings and matching it with
source code so we were sure it

00:35:08.306,00:35:15.213
was 3proxy. Um, they protected
scans from local hosts so it was
a first one who did that and uh

00:35:15.213,00:35:20.385
ipv6 would co- completely
sealed, so any external scans
through the ipv6 address that we

00:35:20.385,00:35:26.491
got were were giving absolutely
no result. But we know that the
proxy entry is again Debian 9. A

00:35:26.491,00:35:31.963
lot of Debian in this industry.
I don’t know why. Uh but they uh
through fingerprinting of the

00:35:31.963,00:35:36.968
Nginx and Open SSH. And so
wrapping this up, uh, what we’re
gonna say is like there are

00:35:39.170,00:35:44.542
several providers uh uh and
everything we analyze I don’t
feel its powered by malware, but

00:35:44.542,00:35:50.849
clearly Valar solution sis the
shadiest one and the one who
protects itself the most. So if

00:35:50.849,00:35:55.654
I had more time, I would
definitely lo- look into these
guys, cause um, there there’s

00:35:55.654,00:36:00.592
something weird uh about that
service. Uh there is a a paper
it was released called Resident

00:36:02.694,00:36:07.632
Evil: Understanding Residential
IP Proxy as a Dark Service,
which is very interesting. And

00:36:07.632,00:36:11.369
they took a completely different
approach than us. And we found
it while doing that research

00:36:11.369,00:36:16.975
after we were accepted to talk
about. Uh this stuff here. But
so I just want to give them a

00:36:16.975,00:36:23.481
hat tip you know. Cause uh they
actually uh they collaborate
with ISP so we use the proxies

00:36:23.481,00:36:28.953
and try to a- access if its
compromised infrastructure or
not. But they saw traffic go

00:36:28.953,00:36:34.025
through these proxies and they
know what they are used for.
Very interesting paper and its

00:36:34.025,00:36:38.596
collaboration between Indiana
University of Bloom- uh
Bloomington and Tsinghua

00:36:38.596,00:36:44.102
University and its more than 10
people that worked on it so I
think they need a hat tip. So

00:36:44.102,00:36:50.341
where do you we stand now? We
have a IoT botnet which we
started with 4 years agao, but

00:36:50.341,00:36:54.913
now we know it could be done
residential proxy that you could
put- pay for right? We have

00:36:54.913,00:37:01.352
automation software, which uses
these two services in order to
automate or make scale your

00:37:01.352,00:37:08.359
Instagram interactions right? We
have resetter panels and panel
as a service provider. So we

00:37:08.359,00:37:13.998
have all that stuff, but who
buys from the reseller panel?
What’s going up uh upwards,

00:37:13.998,00:37:19.003
right? Masarah. >>Yes. Ok, so
what we did is we called them
customer facing sellers. So we

00:37:21.239,00:37:23.241
they just chill out. They just
chill out on top of the tree
above everybody, because they’re

00:37:23.241,00:37:25.243
the ones like dealing with the
celebrities or agencies related
to the celebrities. I just give

00:37:25.243,00:37:27.245
you an example here. Um, of the
Devumi. Have you heard of
Devumi? No. Ok. So uh this is a

00:37:27.245,00:37:29.247
customer facing seller, uh it
just it looks really legitimate.
They do lots of customer

00:37:29.247,00:37:31.249
services. Uh you can pay with
credit cards, its less shady and
easier for anyone who’s not in

00:37:31.249,00:37:33.351
who’s not technical. Or who
wouldn’t- who would believe that
what you’re doing is ok. And

00:37:33.351,00:37:36.554
what’s interesting about D-
Devumi is that it they were in a
legal procedure with some of

00:37:36.554,00:37:39.557
their partners who were trying
to sell their, to steal their
customer. So they ended up

00:37:39.557,00:37:44.562
having to publish their list of
customers and the New York Time
took that as an opportunity to

00:37:46.798,00:37:50.935
create a huge investigation
called The Follower Factory.
Where they actually sort of show

00:37:50.935,00:37:56.307
names of people who bought from
Devumi and names that are people
that are well known in the

00:37:56.307,00:38:00.145
United States. And following
that uh investigation, the New
York Attorney General, did a

00:38:00.145,00:38:03.481
legal proceeding against Devumi
and sort of announced
groundbreaking settlement saying

00:38:03.481,00:38:05.483
that selling fake followers or
likes is illegal deception. So
Devumi was fined 50,000 dollars

00:38:05.483,00:38:07.485
for what it was doing, according
to the um, New York
investigation, the New York

00:38:07.485,00:38:09.487
Times investigation, they made
over like 5 to 6 million a year.
So it was that of a high fine.

00:38:09.487,00:38:14.492
And obviously what happened once
this uh solution was sort of uh
pulled out by the New York

00:38:25.870,00:38:30.141
attorney general is that Devumi
closed down obviously. But
obviously also, they just went

00:38:30.141,00:38:36.414
down to their best alternative.
So Social Boss dot Org,
InstaGrowing dot Net and

00:38:36.414,00:38:41.419
YoutubeGrow dot com, so like it
hasn’t thought much of what’s
going on. And then lastly the

00:38:43.888,00:38:50.795
people that are driving this
whole business. The buyers. You
get it? Squirrel. And where do

00:38:50.795,00:38:55.800
they stand, well, they stand at
the top of the tree next to the
customer facing seller and

00:39:17.422,00:39:22.427
nearby the fruits of social
networks. How did we sort of end
up analyzing the potent Well, we

00:39:30.301,00:39:35.473
dates back to our analysis in
2016, we knew that Linux/Moose
was proxying traffic in 86

00:39:35.473,00:39:39.777
percent of its traffic was
Instagram so we took only
Instagram and then we sort of

00:39:39.777,00:39:44.983
developed a methodology um which
said that if Linux/Moose had
followed more than 5 times the

00:39:44.983,00:39:49.821
accounts, if it wasn’t a super
popular person, like a Kim
Kardashian, because we know that

00:39:49.821,00:39:53.791
they’re following these people
to look more legitimate and it
had to have a very low

00:39:53.791,00:39:57.895
engagement. So they have like
100,000 cus- uh followers, but
like when they post a picture,

00:39:57.895,00:40:02.967
there’s 2 or 3 likes and it just
sort of shows you that it’s
probably fake following. And

00:40:02.967,00:40:09.874
then we did a content analysis.
So from this sample, uh we
categorized as much as we could

00:40:09.874,00:40:14.545
the people that we saw. So for
example, first thing that we, 20
percent of our sample, was the

00:40:14.545,00:40:21.119
enter- entertainment industry.
So people like this guy who
would have uh 30,000 followers,

00:40:21.119,00:40:25.957
but in the end when you clicked
on his YouTube channel, it’d be
like 10 to 12 views or you know

00:40:25.957,00:40:30.962
like very low. And this person
uh with 200,000 followers who
calls himself reality, TV

00:40:33.631,00:40:38.636
personality, actor, global,
jetsetter and you wouldn’t find
anything about him online.

00:40:38.636,00:40:45.109
Except from that.Then 21 percent
of our sample was selling
products or services. So example

00:40:45.109,00:40:50.281
of watches being sold online uh
ev- all or most of the products
and services that were

00:40:50.281,00:40:55.053
advertised on Instagram were
were like luxurious stuff. Maybe
that’s just a result of the

00:40:55.053,00:41:00.191
social network, but here’s
another example of a jewelry in
Paris. Who also we found in our

00:41:00.191,00:41:05.196
botnet. And lastly the saddest
things is more than a quarter of
our sample was personal

00:41:07.799,00:41:12.804
profiles. So individuals who
post pictures of their food or
of them hanging out on boats and

00:41:15.540,00:41:19.644
then they have lots of
followers, but they know they’re
false. So it sort of questions

00:41:19.644,00:41:24.415
us as to, you post them and you
think you have visibility, but
inside of yourself you know that

00:41:24.415,00:41:29.921
is not the case. [laughter] But
lets say that that’s just
another research for psychology

00:41:29.921,00:41:35.626
or something. [laughter] But
yeah. And then that’s how we
ended up calling this market the

00:41:35.626,00:41:39.931
eagle market. And then there was
the unexpected ones. So what
happens is that I could

00:41:39.931,00:41:44.802
categorize about I’d say 60
something percent of the sample.
But there was so many weird

00:41:44.802,00:41:49.741
profiles that I couldn’t say oh
yes, this is this or this is
that. So for example, here I had

00:41:49.741,00:41:55.813
a mil- an Iraqi military general
uh who was in the spec- special
forces and unfortunately this is

00:41:55.813,00:42:00.451
his profile and it’s probably
the person managing his account
that has bought fake following.

00:42:00.451,00:42:04.822
Or its potential, right? Like we
haven’t seen these people doing
it, we just, we’ve seen them in

00:42:04.822,00:42:09.827
our botnet. And we also saw some
qui- quite large amount of
magicians, spiritual psychic, uh

00:42:12.430,00:42:18.903
people involved in magic. Here I
give you an example of a New
York home witch as she called

00:42:18.903,00:42:23.908
herself. So yeah, um, 141,000
followers. And then there’s the
fascinating ones. Ok. So here I

00:42:29.147,00:42:35.753
give you a it makes sense right.
An STDs testing account. Well
obviously if you were to want to

00:42:35.753,00:42:41.292
have followers online, who would
follow that, right? So it makes
sense that you buy this.

00:42:41.292,00:42:46.931
[laughter] And then there’s dogs
with more money than you.
[laughter] Right. How do you

00:42:46.931,00:42:51.936
categorize that. Right? Like
anyway. So we made an
experiment. Ok. Uh. You get it,

00:42:54.472,00:43:01.245
it’s a duck face in a mirror.
Ok. So we knew that Linux/Moose
was targeting uh Instagram, but

00:43:01.245,00:43:06.884
it was also targeting Periscope,
Flipagram and Kiwi, which is,
which are unknown social

00:43:06.884,00:43:11.722
networks. And we found the
seller, a customer facing
seller, that was selling those

00:43:11.722,00:43:17.862
uh, fo- fake following on these
social networks. So we though
well lets just try to buy from

00:43:17.862,00:43:21.732
that customer facing seller and
see if we’ll see the account
going through to Honeypots,

00:43:21.732,00:43:26.170
right? So what we did is we
bought, I created a fake account
called beautifulbird33. We

00:43:26.170,00:43:32.009
bought 6,000 followers, got
8,000 cause I complained. And
you know I wanted increase the

00:43:32.009,00:43:38.516
chances of seeing the the
account. And luckily that day
was one of our best day in the

00:43:38.516,00:43:43.354
research. Is that the the
account went through the traffic
in our Honeypots. So that sort

00:43:43.354,00:43:49.393
of confirmed our investigation
even more, right? And if you
think about it, what we did is

00:43:49.393,00:43:54.599
we acted as the buyer and we
went on a customer facing seller
and then we saw the account

00:43:54.599,00:43:59.136
going through the botnet. We
don’t know what happened in the
middle with the reseller panels,

00:43:59.136,00:44:04.542
but we know that it happened. So
in terms of the revenue, I’m
gonna go a little bit quicker,

00:44:04.542,00:44:10.948
just because we’re gonna miss we
de- we’re short on time. But in
2016, uh when we studied the

00:44:10.948,00:44:15.786
botnet we had the customer
facing sellers prices and we
concluded that most of the

00:44:15.786,00:44:20.558
profit was going to the botnet.
So what w is we calculated the
amount of follows that we saw in

00:44:20.558,00:44:25.329
each honeypots and then took the
prices that we saw in customer
facing sellers and just addition

00:44:25.329,00:44:31.836
added this together. And we
said, well, if Linux/Moose has
3,000- th- 33,000 bots then it

00:44:31.836,00:44:36.207
would make on average, for
example, 400,000 dollars.
However, now we know there’s

00:44:36.207,00:44:41.546
much more actors involved right?
So you have the buyer who buys
from the customer facing seller,

00:44:41.546,00:44:47.885
who has a mid price on average
for 95 thousand, 95 dollars for
10,000 followers and then the

00:44:47.885,00:44:53.090
customer facing seller will go
on the reseller panel and then
will pay at much lower price for

00:44:53.090,00:44:56.727
the fake following. And then we
don’t know how much Linux/Moose
is going to make out of this

00:44:56.727,00:45:01.899
right? But what we know is the
cheapest reseller panel is 1
point 8 dollar for 10,000

00:45:01.899,00:45:07.371
followers. Which I’m honestly,
I’m pretty sure that’s a scam,
but still. And then meanwhile

00:45:07.371,00:45:11.976
you have all these actors that
are still making money. So you
have the so- the panels service

00:45:11.976,00:45:17.915
provider who makes on average 47
a month per client. And proxies,
its about 2 dollars per proxy

00:45:17.915,00:45:22.286
per month and the automation
software will make, they’re
making on average between 10 to

00:45:22.286,00:45:28.459
16 dollars a month per client
too. So let’s just do an
exercise ok. You want to be

00:45:28.459,00:45:32.897
trending, you want to buy 10,000
followers provided within a
week. So you’re doing something.

00:45:32.897,00:45:37.134
You’re going to DefCon and
you’re like, this is my chance,
I’m gonna get popular. And then

00:45:37.134,00:45:40.972
you know that each bot, we know
that each bot performed on
average a thousand follows per

00:45:40.972,00:45:44.609
month on Instagram. And how do
we know that. Well, we just
calculated that, we took the

00:45:44.609,00:45:48.579
average and if its not that
high, its because the botnet has
to imitate a lot of human

00:45:48.579,00:45:51.816
behavior to ensure its not
flagging. It won’t go like
follow, follow, follow, follow,

00:45:51.816,00:45:56.821
right? And then uh that equals
to about 280 follows a week. And
for that, if you wanted to go

00:45:59.357,00:46:04.228
through proxies, well, you would
need 36 proxies at a median cost
of 2 dollars a month, so it

00:46:04.228,00:46:09.634
would cost you a flat cost of 72
dollars. I mean that’s quite
expensive right, for the median

00:46:09.634,00:46:14.038
price of 2 dollars per proxy per
month. So that’s sort of leads
us to think that this is not for

00:46:14.038,00:46:18.476
nothing, that Linux/Moose
exists, right? Infected devices
are cheap and otherwise that

00:46:18.476,00:46:23.547
Valar Solution or like more
shadier actors are involved. So
Valar like sells for about 50

00:46:23.547,00:46:28.552
cents. A proxy. For a month. And
then if we just le- estimate
Linux/Moose capacity, so if we

00:46:31.822,00:46:36.927
say that uh Linux/Moose has for
example, 40,000 bots, then we
could say that it’s make, it

00:46:36.927,00:46:43.034
could make on average 40 million
Instagram follows. Per month. So
that’s quite a lot. And if we

00:46:43.034,00:46:48.773
try to see how it sort of fits
on the graph, then that’s how
you see that if you take the

00:46:48.773,00:46:53.511
minimum price of the reseller
panel, it would make much less
money than we expected. And then

00:46:53.511,00:46:58.215
the first quartile is a little
bit higher in the median pri-
price is even higher. But what’s

00:46:58.215,00:47:02.453
the main takeaway from this is
mainly just to understand that
we often try to estimate

00:47:02.453,00:47:06.557
profitability just by adding one
by the other, but there’s often
many actors involved and we

00:47:06.557,00:47:10.094
don’t calculate that, so we’re
always like, oh, this is
millions of dollars for the

00:47:10.094,00:47:13.698
malicious actors. But in the
end, you see that it’s much more
complicated than that and

00:47:13.698,00:47:19.937
there’s other people making
money out of this, right. So
this is sort of how we concluded

00:47:19.937,00:47:24.041
our illustration of the
ecosystem of social media
manipulation so you see all the

00:47:24.041,00:47:30.448
actors here. There’s other
research avenues, so obviously
you have other ways to be able

00:47:30.448,00:47:35.986
to create fake following such as
click farms, compromised
accounts and troll farms. And

00:47:35.986,00:47:40.357
just to um, let you know there’s
some inf- journalists that are
working right now into uh

00:47:40.357,00:47:44.361
interviewing actors involved in
the ecosystem that we talked
about. So and they’re going to

00:47:44.361,00:47:48.099
publish really soon so if you
have uh you’re interested in
knowing more about that, you can

00:47:48.099,00:47:52.069
come talk to me and I can put
you in contact with them. And
there’s a prof in Germany called

00:47:52.069,00:47:57.708
Patrik Van Hul who’s also
working on interviewing reseller
panels owner. So I think I’m

00:47:57.708,00:48:02.646
gonna stop here cause I had a
what to do next. But it’s the.
Oh yeah. Ok. What to do next.

00:48:04.782,00:48:10.321
Ok. Really quickly. Just keep
your attention, policy makers
will make into the soc- the sell

00:48:10.321,00:48:14.658
of social media manipulation
right. Because we saw the New
York attorney general doing it

00:48:14.658,00:48:18.963
and then we we wondering what
the countries could do that in
other states. Law enforcement

00:48:18.963,00:48:23.701
target the middle man panel as a
service provider. They enable so
many actors to sort of connect

00:48:23.701,00:48:30.040
into the customer facing sellers
and the botnet. Social networks
continue to flag any robotic. We

00:48:30.040,00:48:35.379
went on the discord server on
um, Valar Solution and it was
kind of interesting to see that

00:48:35.379,00:48:41.886
just right now, yes, just right
now um people are having a hard
time doing uh fake likes and

00:48:41.886,00:48:46.056
follows cause it seems that
Instagram has published a new
AI. And that’s the really

00:48:46.056,00:48:52.163
struggling to do it. So I mean
it works. And you will maybe try
to focus on the content rather

00:48:52.163,00:48:57.368
than the container. So if
somebody tells you look at this
person, like they have so many

00:48:57.368,00:49:01.705
followers. Well, instead of
saying wow. Just wonder what’s
the person bringing to society

00:49:01.705,00:49:06.644
and what’s the content being
published? Is this pertinent or
not? And lastly, just remember I

00:49:06.644,00:49:11.649
bought 8,000 followers on my
account and I only have 400 now,
so face visibility doesn’t last.

00:49:14.051,00:49:17.888
Thank you very much and I’m
sorry for rushing through the
last part, but it’s very nice to

00:49:17.888,00:49:19.890
be at DefCon and I hope you
enjoy your week. [applause]
