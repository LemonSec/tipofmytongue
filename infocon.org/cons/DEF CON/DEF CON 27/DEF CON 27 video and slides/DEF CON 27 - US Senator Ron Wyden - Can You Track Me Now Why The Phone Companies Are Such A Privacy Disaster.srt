00:00:00.033,00:00:06.940
>>Alright. We are gonna get
started here. So up next we have
uh US Senator Ron Wyden. Um he

00:00:06.940,00:00:11.945
[audience cheers] is the
foremost uut, thank you.
[speaker laughs] [audience

00:00:15.916,00:00:19.519
applause] So uh Senator Wyden’s
the foremost offender of
America’s uh civil liberties in

00:00:19.519,00:00:24.491
the US Senate and the tireless
advocate of smart tech policies.
Bef, years before Edward Snowden

00:00:24.491,00:00:29.229
blew the whistle on the dragnet
surveillance of Americans, Wyden
warned that The Patriot Act was

00:00:29.229,00:00:33.400
being used in ways that would
leave Americans shocked and
angry. And his questioning of

00:00:33.400,00:00:37.971
NSA Director James Clapper in
2013 served as a turning point
in the secret surveillance of

00:00:37.971,00:00:43.477
American’s communications. Since
then, Wyden has fought to
protect American’s privacy and

00:00:43.477,00:00:47.848
security against unwanted
intrusion from the government,
criminals and foreign ack, uh

00:00:47.848,00:00:52.586
hackers alike. He has opposed
the government's efforts to
undermine strong encryption,

00:00:52.586,00:00:56.323
proposed legislation to hold
companies accountable for
protecting their user’s data,

00:00:56.323,00:01:01.328
and authored legislation from,
with Rand Paul to protect
American’s fourth amendment

00:01:01.328,00:01:06.800
rights at the border. Wyden is a
senior member of the senate uh
select committee on intelligence

00:01:06.800,00:01:10.837
on the top democrat of the
senate finance committee and he
lives in Portland, Oregon. So

00:01:10.837,00:01:15.842
without further ado, please
work, welcome uh Senator Wyden.
[audience applause] >>Thank you.

00:01:19.513,00:01:24.518
Thank you. Thank you very much
for that unquestionably
inflationary introduction.

00:01:29.556,00:01:34.561
[audience laughs] And uh I
believe I’m the only United
States Senator here at DEFCON.

00:01:38.899,00:01:43.904
So [audience cheers and
applauds] I am so honored to
extend a greeting from one

00:01:48.942,00:01:55.482
percent of the United States
Senate to all of you. [audience
laughs] We’re gonna get these

00:01:55.482,00:02:00.420
numbers up in the years ahead
folks, count on it! [audience
cheers and applauds] [clears

00:02:02.956,00:02:07.961
throat] And I especially wanna
start with a thank you to the
whole DEFCON community. And my

00:02:12.065,00:02:18.105
sense is that you don't hear
people with election
certificates say this very

00:02:18.105,00:02:23.110
often, if at all, but my view is
that white hat hackers are
absolutely irreplaceable in the

00:02:30.083,00:02:35.088
technological age. [audience
cheers and applauds] And
[applause continues] what I’m

00:02:37.391,00:02:43.196
gonna go back and tell my
colleagues is white hack hackers
do our country an enormous

00:02:43.196,00:02:48.201
service. By finding security
lapses and often shaming the
government, and companies and

00:02:50.237,00:02:55.242
fellow coders into fixing them.
Hackers also make it harder for
the government to hide when it

00:02:57.844,00:03:02.783
spies on Americans or collects
their information. So my view is
the strength of white hat

00:03:08.221,00:03:13.226
hackers makes America stronger,
and American’s safer and I wanna
begin tonight by making sure you

00:03:16.997,00:03:22.002
know this United States Senator
appreciates that. [audience
cheers and applauds] And I do

00:03:28.575,00:03:34.748
have a history of working with
security researchers I’ve
opposed over the years,

00:03:34.748,00:03:39.753
expansions of the Computer Fraud
and Abuse Act, wrote Aaron’s Law
to try and roll it back and

00:03:42.055,00:03:47.060
fought against efforts from the
Clinton Administration that we
embar today to require back

00:03:49.396,00:03:54.401
doors for encryption. [audience
applauds] Back doors [applause
continues] back doors will leave

00:03:57.871,00:04:02.809
America less safe folks.
Encryption [audience cheers and
applauds] encryption is not a

00:04:06.947,00:04:11.952
debate between strong security
and liberty, it’s a debate
between stronger security or

00:04:14.654,00:04:20.393
less strong security. And if you
want the strongest security in
America you have to be for

00:04:20.393,00:04:25.398
strong encryption and know back
doors. [audience applause] So
one of the challenges [clears

00:04:32.405,00:04:37.410
throat] as you know all so well,
is that so often people in
politics basically drive a kind

00:04:41.181,00:04:46.186
of knee jerk response to
something that will be in the
news. And I understand that

00:04:50.390,00:04:55.395
because when there are events,
people who get election
certificates feel that they have

00:04:57.464,00:05:02.402
to quote say something but we’ve
gotta make sure that there is a
greater awareness of technology

00:05:07.574,00:05:12.579
and, in particular, what you all
at DEFCON have done is made a
concerted understandable effort

00:05:18.585,00:05:23.590
to increase people’s awareness
of technology and particularly
it is useful in holding off bad

00:05:27.828,00:05:32.833
ideas that are the knee jerk
reaction. For example when a
tragedy uh hits our country.

00:05:35.902,00:05:40.907
Speaking of really awful ideas,
I wanna talk about the phone
companies storied into history

00:05:45.679,00:05:50.684
of violating the privacy of law
abiding Americans. For more than
a century, the phone companies

00:05:52.919,00:05:57.857
have been willing partners of
government and corporate
surveillance. I’ve sounded the

00:05:57.857,00:06:02.796
alarm about phone surveillance
in the past, but only in the
past few months has the public

00:06:05.599,00:06:10.604
learned some of the most
troubling details about how
these telecom giants sell out

00:06:13.173,00:06:18.178
their customers. And a lot of
the worst has flown under the
radar. So I am gonna describe

00:06:22.482,00:06:27.487
this kind of contemptuous phone
company conduct with respect to
your private information. And

00:06:31.057,00:06:36.062
I’m gonna tell ya how to finally
hold these surveillance state
enablers account, accountable.

00:06:39.132,00:06:44.137
Now this is as I mentioned my
first time at DEFCON. But I do
have a little bit of interesting

00:06:47.107,00:06:52.112
history with this conference. As
many of you may know DEFCON
played a key role in the public

00:06:55.682,00:07:00.620
learning that the NSA had been
vacuuming up their phone
records. Seven years ago, then

00:07:03.723,00:07:08.728
NSA director Keith Alexander,
remember him? He had a lotta
fans here didn’t he? [audience

00:07:14.834,00:07:19.673
giggles quietly] Seven years ago
Keith Alexander, then NSA
director, spoke at DEFCON. He

00:07:19.673,00:07:25.912
told the audience, looked at you
straight in the eye, and said
that allegations that the NSA

00:07:25.912,00:07:30.917
had quote millions or hundreds
of millions of dossiers on
people is absolutely false.

00:07:35.455,00:07:40.460
Unquote. That statement came
only a few weeks after General
Alexander gave a Speech in

00:07:42.962,00:07:47.967
Washington DC and said, and I
quote, we don’t hold data on US
Citizens. Now I remember him

00:07:53.907,00:07:58.912
saying that at this speech and I
said to myself, that is one of
the most untruthful statements

00:08:04.384,00:08:09.389
ever made in the history of the
United States about government
surveillance. General Alexander

00:08:12.659,00:08:17.664
was lying. And as a member of
the Senate Intelligence
Committee I knew he was lying.

00:08:20.700,00:08:25.171
For years along with Senator
Finegold, Udall and Durbin I’d
been fighting to warn the

00:08:25.171,00:08:30.710
American people that the
government had secretly
interpreted section two fifteen

00:08:30.710,00:08:35.715
of The Patriot Act. I warned
that when Americans came to
understand how The Patriot Act

00:08:37.984,00:08:44.991
was being used, they would be
stunned and they would be angry.
Secret interpretations of the

00:08:44.991,00:08:49.996
law run contrary to everything
the founding fathers believed
in. Secret interpretations of

00:08:52.098,00:08:57.103
the law corrode democracy and
secret interpretations of the
law must be stopped. Now because

00:09:02.842,00:09:07.614
this program was classified, my
Intelligence Committee
colleagues and I couldn’t reveal

00:09:07.614,00:09:12.619
it to the American people. But
thanks to Keith Alexander’s
public claims at DEFCON and all

00:09:15.288,00:09:21.995
these fabricated statements that
he was making, I finally had a
hook to ask a public question

00:09:21.995,00:09:27.000
about NSA mass surveillance. So
at the next Public Intelligence
Oversight Hearing, in March

00:09:29.536,00:09:34.207
2013, I asked James Clapper the
Director of National
Intelligence if General

00:09:34.207,00:09:39.212
Alexander was telling the truth.
I bet some of you might remember
the answer. Director Clapper

00:09:42.148,00:09:47.153
said that the NSA did quote not
wittingly collect data on US
citizens. That was also a lie.

00:09:55.562,00:10:00.567
As everybody knows NSA was out
there scooping up millions of
innocent American’s phone

00:10:04.504,00:10:10.210
records. Few months later in the
summer of 2013 Edward Snowden
revealed to the world that the

00:10:10.210,00:10:15.548
government had in fact been
vacuuming up vast numbers of
American’s domestic phone

00:10:15.548,00:10:21.421
records. And you might be
interested to know he noted that
he had been watching Mr.

00:10:21.421,00:10:26.426
Clapper’s false testimony to the
Senate and to the country.
Americans were in fact stunned

00:10:28.995,00:10:35.635
and angry. Section two fifteen
will be expiring later this year
and Congress is gonna be asked

00:10:35.635,00:10:40.640
to reauthorize it. It is
extraordinarily important that
Patriot Act phone record

00:10:44.444,00:10:49.215
surveillance, you know, program
be one in which checks are put
in place so as to protect law

00:10:49.215,00:10:54.220
abiding Americans in their
checks that are not in place
now. Section two fifteen was not

00:11:00.493,00:11:06.566
a one off. Telephone companies
had been partnering with the
government to spy on Americans

00:11:06.566,00:11:11.871
for as long as they've ever been
around. Even before the phone
companies existed, phone

00:11:11.871,00:11:17.610
companies spied on their
customers. Starting in 1919 the
US government’s first code

00:11:17.610,00:11:22.815
breaking agency, known as the
American Black Chamber,
illegally intercepted

00:11:22.815,00:11:28.621
international telegrams through
the willing participation of
telegraph companies like Western

00:11:28.621,00:11:35.595
Union. In 1929 President Hoover,
Secretary of State, Henry
Stimson, shut down the program

00:11:35.595,00:11:40.600
as soon as he learned about it.
He said gentlemen do not read
other gentlemen’s mail. Now that

00:11:43.436,00:11:48.441
might be an old fashioned way to
put it but he sure was a patriot
who understood the dangers of

00:11:50.577,00:11:55.582
indiscriminate domestic spying.
But the problems continued.
Beginning in 1945 the US Army

00:11:57.617,00:12:02.221
and later the National Security
Agency was given copies of all
telegrams, domestic and

00:12:02.221,00:12:08.127
international, carried by the
three major phone companies. The
companies only agreed to help

00:12:08.127,00:12:12.498
after they were personally
assured by the Secretary of
Defense they wouldn't be

00:12:12.498,00:12:17.503
prosecuted. They wouldn’t be
prosecuted and their involvement
would be kept secret. That

00:12:19.839,00:12:24.844
surveillance program was known
as Operation Shamrock and it was
around for thirty years until

00:12:26.980,00:12:33.086
Frank Church shut it down.
Later, shortly after Nine
Eleven, George W. Bush

00:12:33.086,00:12:38.091
authorized the NSA to conduct a
dragnet surveillance program
sweeping up both metadata and

00:12:40.126,00:12:46.599
content of emails and phone
calls. This was a massive
illegal spying program and it

00:12:46.599,00:12:53.473
could take place only because
major telecommunications
carriers gave the NSA direct

00:12:53.473,00:12:58.478
access to their networks. Once
this program became public, the
phone companies got sued by the

00:13:02.448,00:13:08.554
ACLU, by the Electronic Frontier
Foundation they got sued by
everybody in sight. In response

00:13:08.554,00:13:14.227
Verizon argued in court that it
had a first amendment right to
share it’s customers private

00:13:14.227,00:13:19.232
data with the NSA. When that
didn’t work the phone companies
got Congress to give them a get

00:13:21.701,00:13:26.706
out of jail free card. Thirty
one Senators said no sweetheart
immunity deal for the phone

00:13:30.309,00:13:36.315
companies and I’m proud of one
of those Sena, or Senators being
me. Because it was outrageous

00:13:36.315,00:13:41.320
that the phone companies got
that deal. [audience applause]
Now, dragnet surveillance

00:13:46.959,00:13:53.366
basically can’t do it without
the private sector being
willing. Which by the way, Dick

00:13:53.366,00:13:58.371
Cheyney who I don’t quote all
the time, admitted in a 2008
speech. That brings me to

00:14:00.373,00:14:07.013
another spying program that
needs some attention. And this
is the Drug Enforcement

00:14:07.013,00:14:12.018
Administration’s phone spying
program. Earlier this year, the
Justice Department Inspector

00:14:14.721,00:14:19.726
General revealed that the Drug
Enforcement Administration had
occupied and operated an illegal

00:14:22.261,00:14:29.068
bolt spying program for more
than twenty years. Now I’ve sat
on the Senate Intelligence

00:14:29.068,00:14:35.041
Committee for about as long as
anyone in the Senate. And in my
view this was one of the most

00:14:35.041,00:14:40.046
illegal dragnet surveillance
programs in the history of the
country. Take a guess who signed

00:14:43.483,00:14:48.488
off on the program. Anybody
wanna throw out a name? >>Bush!
>>The person who signed off on

00:14:52.592,00:14:57.597
the program was none other than
the current Attorney General
Bill Barr. [Disappointment from

00:15:01.100,00:15:06.139
the Audience] Back when he was
Attorney General for the first
time in 1992 he said it was just

00:15:06.139,00:15:11.344
fine for the DEA to subpoena
bulk records of calls between
the United States and certain

00:15:11.344,00:15:17.483
foreign countries. While the
total number of countries the
program targeted has been hidden

00:15:17.483,00:15:23.689
from the American people, the
Inspector General said publicly
this year that the surveillance

00:15:23.689,00:15:29.996
program and I quote involved the
collection of phone call records
for billions of phone calls from

00:15:29.996,00:15:36.068
the United States to many
different countries. Folks, I
don’t think there’s any question

00:15:36.068,00:15:41.073
whatcha call that. You call it
mass surveillance. And Mr. Barr
was right in the center of the

00:15:45.278,00:15:50.616
whole thing. In the twenty years
that the DEA illegally
connected, collected American’s

00:15:50.616,00:15:55.822
phone records the government
never once went to court. The
governed program relied on a

00:15:55.822,00:16:02.662
twisted interpretation of the
government’s subpoena power. The
Inspector General made clear the

00:16:02.662,00:16:08.401
government only served these
subpoenas on phone companies
that it knew would be willing

00:16:08.401,00:16:15.174
partners. Through the two
decades that the DEA spied on
Americans using this program,

00:16:15.174,00:16:20.179
not a single phone company ever
pushed back, ever asked if the
subpoenas were legal. One reason

00:16:23.249,00:16:29.722
the phone companies were such
willing participants. Inspector
General said is they all got

00:16:29.722,00:16:34.727
paid to fork over your personal
information. I’m not done with
this particular program or Mr.

00:16:39.265,00:16:44.270
Barr’s various activities and we
can talk about that as well. The
phone companies recently have

00:16:48.307,00:16:54.380
been in the news and you’ve seen
a fair amount about it with
respect that their sale of

00:16:54.380,00:16:59.385
location data to uh brokers. And
last summer I conducted an
investigation into the wireless

00:17:03.356,00:17:08.361
carriers and location data.
Essentially I found that the
wireless carriers were treating

00:17:10.963,00:17:15.968
their customer’s phones like
tracking tags and selling real
time location data without

00:17:19.639,00:17:24.644
customers' knowledge or consent.
They were selling it to sleezy
middlemen who then sold it again

00:17:28.514,00:17:33.519
to just about anybody who showed
up with a credit card. Now I
discovered that all four major

00:17:36.055,00:17:42.428
wireless carriers, AT&T,
Verizon, Sprint and T-mobile
were doing this. Were selling

00:17:42.428,00:17:49.168
location data via data um
brokers to a company called
Securus. Their business is

00:17:49.168,00:17:54.173
essentially gouging the families
of prisoners by charging them
huge fees to call relatives who

00:17:57.543,00:18:02.815
are serving time. I discovered
this company had built a web
portal to let prison guards

00:18:02.815,00:18:07.820
track any phone in the country
without a court order. Once I
exposed this program the phone

00:18:11.958,00:18:17.830
companies immediately said we’re
shutting down Securus’ access
and pledged to clean up their

00:18:17.830,00:18:22.835
sale of location data. But as we
kept digging it turned out this
was much bigger than just this

00:18:25.671,00:18:32.478
one uh company gouging the
families of prisoners. In the
months that followed Mr. Joseph

00:18:32.478,00:18:37.817
Cox at Motherboard um revealed,
and he deserves much credit for
this, how the carriers and their

00:18:37.817,00:18:42.822
shady data broker partners were
selling location data to bounty
hunters, used car salesmen and,

00:18:44.924,00:18:49.929
get this, even stalkers! Phone
companies going along with
something that allows for

00:18:53.366,00:18:59.472
stalking of people they’re doing
business with became clear the
practice was totally out of

00:18:59.472,00:19:04.410
control. American’s location
data was available to anybody as
I say who could pay. And by the

00:19:06.479,00:19:11.484
way phone companies promised
once again to shut it down after
Mr. Cox’s story. And you know a

00:19:15.254,00:19:20.259
lot of them said well Ron Wyden
didn’t exactly get the date
right that we were talking about

00:19:22.361,00:19:27.933
when we were gonna shut it down
and all of this, you know, ra,
raz mataz. I think the point

00:19:27.933,00:19:32.938
really is, it is clear that they
were doing business as usual
with these bounty hunters

00:19:37.309,00:19:44.016
invading the rights of law
abiding Americans after they
said they'd stopped. And I’ll

00:19:44.016,00:19:50.089
just tell you, given their track
record, breaking their pledge to
me, I’m not giving them any

00:19:50.089,00:19:55.094
benefit of the doubt. And
neither should you. [audience
applauds] Now [applause

00:19:58.464,00:20:03.469
continues] I wanna go just a
little bit further on why the
wireless carriers are so

00:20:07.306,00:20:13.979
unbelievably bad on privacy. One
thing that frequently comes up
in the debate about privacy,

00:20:13.979,00:20:20.119
particularly after Cambridge
Analytica’s saying quote if you
aren’t paying for the product,

00:20:20.119,00:20:25.124
you are the product, this pretty
much explains the privacy
invasions we’ve seen from

00:20:27.259,00:20:33.766
Facebook. But the phone
companies aren’t offering a free
product. American’s pay a lot

00:20:33.766,00:20:38.771
for our cell phone plans and
they still get their privacy
violated. Here’s my sense of

00:20:41.540,00:20:46.545
what is happening. The wireless
carriers depend on government
licensed spectrum to operate. So

00:20:50.916,00:20:55.921
that gives the government just
by virtue of that, a lot of
power over the companies. The

00:20:58.157,00:21:02.761
Federal Communications
Commission has historically been
at the beck and call of law

00:21:02.761,00:21:07.800
enforcement and intelligence
interests. And it’s used it’s
authority to approve or deny

00:21:07.800,00:21:12.805
licenses as a means to ensure
that other government agencies
get what they want. For example

00:21:15.508,00:21:21.447
in the early two thousands when
a few companies started to offer
satellite phone service the FCC

00:21:21.447,00:21:27.586
set on, sat on the license
application from the satellite
phone company at the FBI’s

00:21:27.586,00:21:34.393
request. It didn’t ok the
license until the company agreed
to put it’s downlink station in

00:21:34.393,00:21:39.198
the United States instead of
Canada so that the government
could force the company to

00:21:39.198,00:21:44.203
wiretap calls. Force the
government to wiretap calls.
Americans need a regulator to

00:21:47.640,00:21:52.912
manage the public spectrum but
the FCC willed the power not in
the public interest but in the

00:21:52.912,00:21:57.149
government's interest. It’s no
surprise the phone companies
choose to get paid by the

00:21:57.149,00:22:02.221
government when they can get it
instead of fighting with the
government. While tech companies

00:22:02.221,00:22:06.358
like Apple, CloudFlare and Yahoo
have fought the government over
problematic surveillance

00:22:06.358,00:22:11.230
requests, the government doesn’t
have nearly as much power over
them as it does over the phone

00:22:11.230,00:22:16.368
companies. That explains the
phone companies willingness to
put the government's needs over

00:22:16.368,00:22:21.373
their customers. But what about
the sale of location data to
data brokers? There is a big

00:22:27.279,00:22:32.284
problem here and um it’s really
two words, Ajit Pai. He’s the
Federal Communications Chairman

00:22:39.225,00:22:43.095
and he doesn’t believe the
agency oughta be in the business
of regulating the wireless

00:22:43.095,00:22:49.468
carriers or privacy in cyber
security. Whether it involves
the sale of location data, shady

00:22:49.468,00:22:54.840
middlemen or the carrier’s
shoddy track record in securing
network from hackers and foreign

00:22:54.840,00:22:59.845
spies uh exploiting flaws in SS
seven. Chairman Pai has made it
clear he is just gonna sit it

00:23:03.782,00:23:08.787
out on the sidelines. When you
have the industry's primary
regulator basically saying he

00:23:11.223,00:23:16.228
just doesn’t have any interest
in accountability. When it comes
to these industry um violations,

00:23:19.598,00:23:24.603
what you have is a situation
where the carriers say Hey look!
Let’s just rake in a little bit

00:23:27.573,00:23:32.578
of extra money by going even
further! Let’s go further. And
in this case sell their

00:23:35.347,00:23:40.352
customer’s location data to even
more people. So, the status quo
isn’t working so well. The

00:23:43.322,00:23:48.460
Federal Communications
Commission is an ineffective
regulator run by an ex Verizon

00:23:48.460,00:23:53.465
lawyer who basically doesn’t
believe in what the job is all
about. Which is accountability

00:23:56.268,00:24:01.974
and oversight and if
appropriate, regulation. The
Department of Justice is run by

00:24:01.974,00:24:06.979
Bill Barr. As I mentioned, an ex
Verizon lawyer, who personally
authorized a massive illegal

00:24:09.148,00:24:14.153
surveillance program and is an
enthusiastic advocate for
unchecked presidential power.

00:24:16.989,00:24:23.095
Um, if any of you are having
trouble sleeping, I gave a long
speech about Mr. Barr

00:24:23.095,00:24:29.768
specifically on the floor of the
Senate and talking about his
entire privacy record basically

00:24:29.768,00:24:35.541
which also um is supplemented by
the proposition that he believes
the president is just above the

00:24:35.541,00:24:40.546
law. That there are no laws that
really are relevant uh to the
president. This issue

00:24:43.982,00:24:50.823
fundamentally is about a lot
more than just privacy. The
total absence of any effective

00:24:50.823,00:24:56.362
privacy regulation combined with
the carriers repeated willing
participation in illegal

00:24:56.362,00:25:03.168
surveillance programs is
basically serving as the
building blocks for Donald Trump

00:25:03.168,00:25:09.241
and future administrations to
expand the surveillance state
and use it against their

00:25:09.241,00:25:14.246
political enemies. Sadly, I have
to tell you that sometimes you
look at this and you say, really

00:25:16.982,00:25:21.387
doesn’t even matter which party
is in control. Government
agencies will fight any effort

00:25:21.387,00:25:26.392
to limit their power and most
politicians just aren’t willing
to spend the political capital

00:25:28.694,00:25:33.699
and the time and the energy to
take em on. But I want you to
know that as long as I have the

00:25:37.202,00:25:41.940
honor to represent Oregon in the
United States Senate, I gather
we got some Oregonians in the

00:25:41.940,00:25:46.945
house? [audience cheers and
applauds] Ooohhhh! I don’t wanna
make some of you feel bad, but

00:25:49.448,00:25:54.453
all the Oregonians in the house
get to participate in the most
logical, sane system of voting

00:25:58.657,00:26:05.130
in the United States. We vote by
mail and one day everybody in
America’s gonna vote by mail

00:26:05.130,00:26:10.135
because I’m gonna make sure it
happens. It’s time. [audience
applauds] So we Oregonians will

00:26:16.375,00:26:21.380
be schmoosin’ on the side when
we’re done. But suffice it to
say I’m just not willing to

00:26:23.415,00:26:28.420
accept business as usual in this
government overreach
surveillance uh state that I

00:26:34.293,00:26:39.865
have just described. And here’s
my playbook for how to fight
back. First, Congress must pass

00:26:39.865,00:26:44.503
comprehensive privacy
legislation that finally gives
the Federal Trade Commission the

00:26:44.503,00:26:49.508
tools it needs to hold companies
accountable for privacy
violations. It is my view that

00:26:52.411,00:26:57.416
CEO’s should face jail when they
lie to the government about
their privacy policies. [clap

00:27:03.822,00:27:08.827
clap] And we [audience applauds]
we, we have had one instance,
you know, after another of these

00:27:13.665,00:27:18.670
kinds of enormous, enormous,
enormously damaging cases where
uh whether it’s Facebook uh

00:27:23.075,00:27:28.480
customers or somebody else get
hurt by these privacy
violations. And my privacy bill

00:27:28.480,00:27:33.719
would give Americans an
effective, easy way to stop
companies from sharing their

00:27:33.719,00:27:38.724
private information with data
brokers and all of these other
uh bottom feeders. These shady

00:27:41.460,00:27:45.564
middlemen. Second, phone
companies and really all
companies that hold private

00:27:45.564,00:27:50.569
customer data must reduce the
length of time that they keep
that data on hand. I proposed

00:27:54.239,00:27:59.244
that yesterday. And the reason I
did is after the big hacks of
OPM, Equifax and Capital One

00:28:01.346,00:28:07.920
it’s clear that the only sure
fire way to stop data from being
stolen is to not have it laying

00:28:07.920,00:28:12.925
around for ages and ages in the
first place. The wireless
carriers keep information about

00:28:20.032,00:28:26.638
American’s calls and texts and
locations history for far too
long. In AT&T’s case, the

00:28:26.638,00:28:31.643
company apparently has call
records going back to 1987. This
kind of sort of data retention

00:28:38.016,00:28:43.021
is a huge, huge gift to hostile
foreign governments that want to
hack our citizens. So I did, as

00:28:49.828,00:28:54.833
I said, this week, in effect,
write to the wireless carriers.
Told them they oughta delete uh

00:28:58.704,00:29:04.476
records once they no longer
serve a legitimate purpose and
if they don't do it, I’m gonna

00:29:04.476,00:29:11.350
make sure that the Congress gets
serious about stepping in and
doing it for em. It’s a safety

00:29:11.350,00:29:16.355
and security measure. [audience
applauds] And third, the Supreme
Court, last year, held that the

00:29:22.861,00:29:29.768
government needs a warrant to
collect location data. But there
are still unresolved questions

00:29:29.768,00:29:34.306
including whether or not the
court’s decision in the
Carpenter Case even applies to

00:29:34.306,00:29:40.846
the Intelligence Community. So I
will be introducing an updated
version of my GPS Act in the

00:29:40.846,00:29:45.851
coming months to ensure that the
government can not track
Americans without a warrant. In

00:29:48.420,00:29:55.327
each of these efforts, I
certainly have appreciated many
of you and DEFCON giving us

00:29:55.327,00:30:00.332
technical help. I wanna close by
talking about uh the debate that
you’re going to see uh later

00:30:07.673,00:30:12.678
this year and why it’s so
important that those who care
about the real need for liberty

00:30:16.748,00:30:22.754
and security and understand that
the two are not mutually
exclusive. Good policies get you

00:30:22.754,00:30:27.759
both, bad policies get you
neither. Is that section two
fifteen of The Patriot Act

00:30:31.029,00:30:36.034
expires in December of this
year. December of 2019. Now, as
sure as the night follows the

00:30:42.441,00:30:47.446
day, in the United States
Senate, the Senate will wait
until the very last minute. When

00:30:54.052,00:30:59.057
you all have your Christmas
trees up, and the wrapping paper
is flying every which way, and

00:31:02.994,00:31:09.334
Americans are debating who will
cook the Christmas Turkey.
Because that’s always what

00:31:09.334,00:31:14.339
happens. It comes up at the end
of the year and the Office of
National Intelligence says oh my

00:31:16.808,00:31:21.813
god. If we don't’ just extend
this bill, Western Civilization
is gonna end. The following bad

00:31:25.117,00:31:31.323
guys will be striking us, they
will practically be arriving
under our holiday trees to take

00:31:31.323,00:31:36.328
your children and all kinds of
other things. And I exaggerate
but barely. [audience laughs]

00:31:40.899,00:31:47.906
Barley. Because that’s what they
do. And as sure as the night
follows the day. So you will see

00:31:47.906,00:31:52.911
me, as we get into Halloween and
the like, constantly come back
to “Hey folks, we need to have

00:31:56.681,00:32:01.787
the debate about section two
fifteen in The Patriot Act. We
gotta have it before Christmas

00:32:01.787,00:32:07.726
Eve. The American people should
know that we can come up with
policies that protect both their

00:32:07.726,00:32:12.731
liberty and their security.” And
I really would hope that some of
you in DEFCON and all the good

00:32:14.833,00:32:19.838
work that you’re uh doing will
uh, help us as usual in it. So
as I said, uh last minute

00:32:24.409,00:32:31.216
there’s always some kind of
claim. In fact, uh one year I
was actually able to get the

00:32:31.216,00:32:35.954
Office of National Intelligence
to make was, what was an
admission against interest.

00:32:35.954,00:32:40.725
Where they basically said, when
everybody said it’s all gonna
expire they really said no it’s

00:32:40.725,00:32:46.031
not going to expire, there’s
authority to have it for, you
know, a longer period. I don’t

00:32:46.031,00:32:52.704
know what happened to that
lawyer who wrote that but um
suffice it to say this is an

00:32:52.704,00:32:57.709
incredibly important uh law with
respect to surveillance section
two fifteen of The Patriot Act.

00:33:00.712,00:33:06.918
Most of the debate will focus on
the call detail record program.
Program in which the government

00:33:06.918,00:33:11.923
collects metadata about uh
people uh and who they call. And
I am going to push very hard to

00:33:17.262,00:33:22.267
see if we can put a stake in
this program and close it once
and for all. It has not been

00:33:25.670,00:33:30.675
used to stop a single terrorist
attack. And it’s even less
useful now, when the bad guys

00:33:33.845,00:33:38.850
have so many other ways to
communicate. The reason I wanna
finish it off now, is that if

00:33:42.254,00:33:47.259
you leave spying authority on
the books, nobody knows which
administration is gonna do it,

00:33:51.029,00:33:56.034
but I don’t want to say trust us
to any administration to have
the power to abuse it. [audience

00:34:05.777,00:34:10.348
applauds] So the phone records
dragnet is important but there
are other sections of twenty

00:34:10.348,00:34:16.087
fifteen, of two fifteen that are
important as well. In 2014 the
FBI and Director of National

00:34:16.087,00:34:21.693
Intelligence confirmed in
unclassified letters to me that
the Intelligence Community used

00:34:21.693,00:34:26.698
section two fifteen to obtain
historical records of American’s
location data. I made one of

00:34:29.067,00:34:33.471
those letters public a few weeks
ago. Earlier this year the
Director of National

00:34:33.471,00:34:39.244
Intelligence also revealed the
Intelligence Agencies still
haven’t been told how they

00:34:39.244,00:34:45.383
should interpret the Carpenter
Decision, holding that location
data is protected by the fourth

00:34:45.383,00:34:50.388
amendment. So, here we are,
section two fifteen, one of the
most powerful surveillance laws

00:34:53.091,00:34:59.764
on the books. A law that has
been abused by the government
before, and the person who is

00:34:59.764,00:35:04.703
now in charge of the Department
of Justice, Bill Barr. Mr. Barr
has shown an eager willingness

00:35:09.774,00:35:14.779
to perform legal gymnastics to
let the government spy on
Americans. So before Congress

00:35:18.717,00:35:25.557
reauthorizes section two
fifteen, I think it’s critically
important that the public be

00:35:25.557,00:35:30.929
told whether or not the
government believes it still may
use this law to attract, to

00:35:30.929,00:35:35.934
track American’s phones without
a warrant. If you wanna break
the classic cycle of Congress

00:35:40.005,00:35:45.010
rubber stamping, Congress needs
to hear from the American people
that this is something they care

00:35:47.746,00:35:52.751
about. And I’ll just close by
way of saying there is no
question in my mind that white

00:35:55.820,00:36:00.759
hat hackers, the DEFCON
community really gets it. The
number of stickers and EFF

00:36:05.263,00:36:10.268
t-shirts and hoodies and
everything I’ve seen walking
around today is the clear signal

00:36:12.837,00:36:17.842
that everybody here on a Friday
night in Las Vegas for Pete’s
sake! [audience laughs] There

00:36:21.479,00:36:26.484
are a lot of fun things to do
[audience laughs] in Las Vegas
on a Friday night. And this is a

00:36:30.522,00:36:36.127
community that understands the
importance of privacy and
oversight of the Intelligence

00:36:36.127,00:36:41.132
Community and the need for
strong back door free
encryption. And the fact that

00:36:41.132,00:36:46.404
you’re all here on a Friday
night is an indication to me
that we can work together to

00:36:46.404,00:36:53.111
make sure that the rest of the
country understands how
important this stuff is. And, in

00:36:53.111,00:36:58.116
a lot of ways, whistle blowers
and white hat hackers in
particular, in my view are our

00:37:02.520,00:37:07.525
last line of defense against
government and corporate
surveillance. Americans should

00:37:10.962,00:37:15.967
never have to trust in just good
will of government or phone
companies or social media. We

00:37:19.737,00:37:24.743
need black letter laws that keep
our private information safe.
And I want you to know that

00:37:29.848,00:37:34.853
Congress only acts when the
American people speak out. I
know that this is a community

00:37:39.224,00:37:44.229
that cares. Please, let’s join
together and make sure that we
mobilize from sea to shining

00:37:48.433,00:37:53.438
sea, concerned citizens that
share our views, share our
values, share our priorities

00:37:57.142,00:38:02.080
about pushing back against
unfair uh surveillance. And
thank you for having me. I would

00:38:05.216,00:38:10.221
like to say that I think by
order of the federal government,
I should give you the rest of

00:38:13.258,00:38:18.263
the night off. [audience laughs
and applauds] And before I do
that, let’s just together, keep

00:38:28.139,00:38:33.144
up fighting the good fight.
Thanks everybody! [audience
cheers and applauds] Thank you.
