1
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:17,670
- It's August, 2018,

2
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:21,740
a Syst Admin logs into the
control panel of a wind turbine

3
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:24,583
in Southern France to update its firmware.

4
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:28,240
More than 600 kilometers away,

5
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,393
their PHP session token
appears on my screen.

6
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:33,870
Eight months later,

7
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:37,770
and Egyptian oil tanker pulls
into the port of Sfax, Tunisia

8
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:40,620
with a malfunctioning alternator onboard.

9
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:44,600
From my vantage point, more
than 1500 kilometers away,

10
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,650
I learn that the ship
will be out of commission

11
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:48,100
for at least a month

12
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:50,040
and I learn the name and passport number

13
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:53,133
of the engineer who's
flying away to fix it.

14
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:59,070
Just this summer, 13,000 meters
above the Atlantic ocean,

15
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:01,340
the accountant of a
Polish real estate group

16
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:05,190
put the finishing touches on
their annual financial report.

17
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:08,450
The word document she
prepared reached my computer

18
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:11,870
at the same time it arrived at
the inboxes of her colleagues

19
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:13,340
at their parent company,

20
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:15,350
one of Europe's largest private commercial

21
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:17,100
real estate trusts.

22
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:19,090
How does this sort of thing happen?

23
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:21,290
How do I get this information

24
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:24,100
and how do we protect it in the future?

25
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:25,230
I'm James Pavur,

26
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:27,980
I'm a PhD student at Oxford University

27
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:30,770
where I researched
satellite cyber security.

28
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:33,090
And today I wanna talk about the results

29
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:35,820
of more than two years of experiments

30
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:39,140
looking at real world use
of satellite broadband.

31
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:41,320
I do this work with a
bunch of talented people

32
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:43,370
from both the UK and Switzerland,

33
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:46,330
and I'm honored to get
to share what we found.

34
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:50,170
This actually started as a
fairly small summer project.

35
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:52,790
What we wanted to do is
take a look at some research

36
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:55,000
from the mid to late 2000s

37
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,880
and see if we could
replicate these findings.

38
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,570
And what was cool about this research

39
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:01,840
is that these people found

40
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,330
that there were these
satellite television feeds

41
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:06,900
that were encapsulating
internet traffic as well

42
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:08,390
and that if you had the right equipment

43
00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:09,640
and the right knowhow,

44
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:10,600
you could actually find

45
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:14,420
sensitive un-encrypted internet
traffic inside those feeds.

46
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:17,860
Now, a lot has changed both
about the way we use satellites

47
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:20,350
and the way we use the
internet since 2005.

48
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:22,260
We have smart phones and stuff now

49
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:24,390
and so we wanted to update this research

50
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:26,060
and also to make it a little bit broader

51
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:30,450
and more systematic, look at
large scale usage patterns.

52
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:31,660
So what we ended up doing

53
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:34,810
is conducting a series of
domain-focused experiments,

54
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:38,000
looking at real world
users at land, at sea

55
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,700
and in the sky, for these
satellite internet connections.

56
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:44,620
In total, we analyzed
signals from 18 satellites

57
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:45,920
in geostationary orbit

58
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,940
with a combined coverage area of

59
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:50,730
about a 100,000,000 square kilometers.

60
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:52,190
To put that into perspective,

61
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:54,140
that means we were able to receive signals

62
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:56,440
from as far away as parts
of the United States

63
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:59,000
and the Caribbean, China and India,

64
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,730
a massive coverage area for an attacker.

65
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:04,300
And in all 18 of these feeds,

66
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:06,940
we identified deeply
sensitive internet traffic,

67
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:09,550
whether it was being transmitted
using those protocols

68
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:12,930
that had issues we've
known about since 2005

69
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:15,920
or using newer protocols
that have replaced it.

70
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,360
And it wasn't just any data,

71
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,800
it was some pretty interesting traffic.

72
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:23,100
We saw sensitive information
from nine members

73
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:26,670
of the Fortune Global 500
that we were able to identify,

74
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:28,390
traffic belonging to passengers

75
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:30,950
on six of the 10 largest
airlines in the world

76
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:32,113
by passenger count,

77
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,770
traffic belonging to maritime companies

78
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:37,740
who together make up 40%

79
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:40,603
of the world's cargo
shipping capacity by volume,

80
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:44,010
and traffic belonging
to government agencies

81
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:47,490
ranging from the postal service
of a Eastern European Nation

82
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:49,450
to an actual air force jet

83
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:51,630
belonging to a North African country.

84
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:54,820
We even saw traffic from
regular people like you,

85
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:57,760
people who might browse
wifi in a coffee shop

86
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,960
or update their Instagram
while they're on a cruise.

87
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:03,620
Now, before I delve into
the meed of this traffic,

88
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:06,190
how we got at it and what it has inside,

89
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:09,030
I wanna be sure we're all
starting at the same point

90
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:10,720
and give you a bit of a crash course

91
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,600
in satellite communications.

92
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:15,160
So I'm gonna run through a
very simple scenario here

93
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:17,420
to explain what satellite communications

94
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:18,833
look like in practice.

95
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:21,140
So here's our satellite.

96
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:22,950
It's in geostationary orbit,

97
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:26,920
which means it's 30,000 kilometers
above the earth surface.

98
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,950
We have a customer in the Atlantic Ocean

99
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:30,750
who wants to talk to this satellite.

100
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:34,856
And to do this, they wanna visit a website

101
00:04:34,856 --> 00:04:38,230
over the satellite feed that's
hosted over here in Ireland.

102
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:40,400
We'll say it's google.com

103
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,710
and they have a device on their boat

104
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:44,280
that's called the visa terminal

105
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,520
or a very small aperture terminal,

106
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,550
which is what they'll
use for this connection.

107
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:50,160
And that device was sold to them

108
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,900
by an internet service provider

109
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:54,313
who runs a ground station here in Madrid.

110
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:56,720
We'll also imagine an attacker

111
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,090
who's quite far away
from this conversation,

112
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:00,120
down here in Accra

113
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:03,000
but still wants to intercept
the communications.

114
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,700
So how does this play out?

115
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:06,980
Well, because our satellite's
in geostationary orbit,

116
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:08,150
it doesn't move around.

117
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:09,360
So our customer just needs

118
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,250
to point their satellite dish at the sky

119
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:12,940
and say, "Get me google.com"

120
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:15,610
using whatever weird
satellite protocol is used

121
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:16,860
in this network.

122
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:19,090
The satellite is more or
less a dumb bent pipe.

123
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:21,580
It doesn't really do any
processing or networking,

124
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:23,570
it just sends that signal right back down

125
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:27,130
on a focused beam towards
the ground station in Madrid.

126
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:28,750
You notice this beam is very narrow,

127
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:31,220
so it passes over our
attacker and across head,

128
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:33,770
they can't intercept this communication.

129
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:34,870
Once we get to Madrid,

130
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:36,480
the satellite internet service provider

131
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:39,010
will convert this weird satellite protocol

132
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:41,490
into normal IP traffic
and route it to Google,

133
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:42,530
just like if you were visiting

134
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:45,030
a webpage at home, terrestrially.

135
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:47,610
It'll get the response over
the terrestrial internet

136
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:49,510
and then beam it back up into space.

137
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:53,240
It's worth noting that when
I say beam up into space,

138
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,970
this isn't a fast process.

139
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:55,850
The roundtrip time

140
00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:58,850
for a conversation like this can
be as long as 700 milliseconds,

141
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:01,000
because the speed of light is only so fast

142
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,830
and geostationary orbit,

143
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:06,580
which is the satellite we're
looking at is very far away.

144
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:08,410
Once we finally make it out there though,

145
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:09,670
there's one last step,

146
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:12,570
which is to beam the
signal back down to earth.

147
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:15,353
Only this time, we'll do it
with a critical difference,

148
00:06:15,353 --> 00:06:17,560
which is because satellites are expensive

149
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,420
and we wanna serve a lot of customers,

150
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:22,400
we'll send it on a really
broad forward link signal.

151
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,300
You'll notice that the
footprint of this signal

152
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:26,147
reaches both our attacker in Ghana

153
00:06:26,147 --> 00:06:27,920
and our customer in the Atlantic Ocean.

154
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:30,770
So those radio waves carrying
that response from Google

155
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:32,470
will hit our attacker satellite dish

156
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:35,140
at the same time as it hit the customers.

157
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:37,890
This is the crux of
satellite eavesdropping.

158
00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:41,390
An attacker can reliably
expect to intercept the signal

159
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:44,370
from very far away on these forward links,

160
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:45,810
but they can't always be guaranteed

161
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:47,600
to see both sides of the conversation,

162
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,943
which is somewhat unusual
for an eavesdropper.

163
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:54,210
Additionally, we can think
about the security properties

164
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:55,043
in this context.

165
00:06:55,043 --> 00:06:58,190
Because if we're imagining
say, a vulnerability in wifi

166
00:06:58,190 --> 00:07:01,440
or GSM where the attacker
has to be in your city

167
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,150
or in your neighborhood to
intercept your communications,

168
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:06,410
here, an attacker can be
in a different country

169
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:08,850
or on a different continent
from their victim.

170
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:11,060
So what does an attacker actually need

171
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:12,520
to pull off this attack?

172
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:15,230
Let's talk a little bit
about our threat model.

173
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:18,490
So in this case, if the
attacker is a nation state,

174
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:19,750
it's very simple.

175
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:21,890
They simply need a little bit of money.

176
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:25,100
There are companies out there
that sells specialized modems

177
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:27,950
for intelligence collection
purposes like this one,

178
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:28,783
and you hook them up

179
00:07:28,783 --> 00:07:31,560
to a multimillion dollar
ground station like this one,

180
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,750
and you're off to the races,

181
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:35,170
just listening to whatever
satellite signals you want.

182
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:36,740
And it's a pretty reasonable assumption

183
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:39,640
to say that national intelligence
services are doing this.

184
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:43,130
However, they don't
really give this equipment

185
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:44,810
to PhD students.

186
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:47,520
So I had to find a different
way to get us information

187
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,680
and that prior research

188
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,750
that talked about using television signals

189
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:53,390
is what led our next step.

190
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:55,650
So we tried to see how far we could get

191
00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:57,810
using simple home television equipment

192
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:59,600
that's widely available.

193
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:02,245
We picked up this nifty
flat panel satellite dish,

194
00:08:02,245 --> 00:08:03,880
which costs around 90 bucks.

195
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:06,380
Although honestly, you
could get something free

196
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:08,460
off of Craigslist or
Gumtree most of the time,

197
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:11,180
you may even have a satellite
dish resting on your roof

198
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:12,550
that you could use.

199
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:13,560
And then we got a card

200
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,810
to interpret these
signals in our computer.

201
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:17,600
Now we use the professional end card,

202
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:20,360
which tends to run about 200 to $300.

203
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:23,307
You could use a much cheaper
card in the $80 price range

204
00:08:23,307 --> 00:08:25,550
at the cost of maybe not being able

205
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:28,010
to comprehend the more
complex internet signals,

206
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:30,570
but you'd still definitely find something.

207
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:32,130
Once we have this equipment,

208
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:34,720
the next test is to actually use it

209
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,750
to connect to a satellite signal.

210
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:39,040
And figuring out where
the satellite is is easy,

211
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:40,100
it's public information.

212
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:42,050
And since in geostationary orbit,

213
00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:43,580
they're not moving anywhere,

214
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:46,100
but actually connecting
is a little bit trickier.

215
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:47,910
So let me show you what that looks like

216
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:49,393
in our lab environment.

217
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,490
So what we're gonna go ahead and do,

218
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:54,940
is use a tool called EBSpro,

219
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:55,773
which is designed

220
00:08:55,773 --> 00:08:58,200
to help people find
satellite television feeds

221
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,880
to listen to if they wanna
watch TV on their computer,

222
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:04,450
and we're gonna scan to hunt
for internet signals instead.

223
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:07,070
Now, what we're gonna do is
point our dish at a satellite

224
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:08,470
that we think has internet service,

225
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:10,220
say, because of a press release.

226
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:12,920
And we're gonna scan the KU
band of the radio spectrum

227
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:15,240
because that's what our
equipment is set up for.

228
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,210
And what we're looking for is signal

229
00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:19,270
against all of this background noise

230
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:22,730
that's indicative of channels
that might have information.

231
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:24,570
In this case, the signal's pretty noisy,

232
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:27,700
but we do see a few distinct
humps in the spectrum graph

233
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:30,520
that might contain actual
traffic inside them.

234
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:32,560
We'll go ahead and tell our
card to connect to this one

235
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,780
and interpret it as a
digital video broadcasting

236
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:36,290
for satellite feed.

237
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:37,370
After a few seconds,

238
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:39,720
we get a lock meaning
that we found a satellite

239
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,770
and we're listening to
the signals from it.

240
00:09:41,770 --> 00:09:42,730
Now, for the demo,

241
00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:44,600
I'm gonna connect to
this weaker signal here

242
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,830
because I know it has
interesting information.

243
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:49,350
You'll see the signal to
noise ratio is pretty abysmal.

244
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:51,140
So we're not likely to
get all of the packets

245
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:53,770
in this network, but hopefully
we'll find something.

246
00:09:53,770 --> 00:09:54,910
I'll go ahead and real quick,

247
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:57,330
just jot down some information
about the frequency,

248
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:59,060
the orientation, and the symbol rate,

249
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:00,560
because we're going to
have to switch tools.

250
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,170
This tool doesn't get us all the way,

251
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:03,790
it's designed for television feeds

252
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:05,660
and what we really want is raw data

253
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:08,210
from that digital video
broadcasting signal.

254
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:09,043
So to do that,

255
00:10:09,043 --> 00:10:11,040
I'll use a tool that's
provided with our device,

256
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,300
that PCIe card in the drivers.

257
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:15,180
We'll lock to that signal we discovered,

258
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:18,070
and then we'll kick off a quick recording.

259
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:20,030
The amount of traffic you
get in a recording like this

260
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:21,340
is hugely variable.

261
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:22,660
You can get a terabyte in a week,

262
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:24,550
you could get a megabyte in a week,

263
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:25,640
it depends on your equipment

264
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,450
and the signal you're listening to.

265
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:28,283
In this case,

266
00:10:28,283 --> 00:10:30,190
I'm just gonna record a
couple of hundred kilobytes,

267
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:31,630
and then we'll take a look at the file

268
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:32,960
and see if we have any indicators

269
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:36,460
that it has internet traffic
instead of television traffic.

270
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:39,020
There's no trick here to differentiating

271
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:40,090
between the two types.

272
00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:43,770
All I'm gonna do is just
grep through that binary file

273
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:46,010
for the string HTTP,

274
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:48,810
which we would expect to see
in an internet recording,

275
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:51,410
but we wouldn't expect to
see in a television feed.

276
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:52,243
And sure enough,

277
00:10:52,243 --> 00:10:55,930
we see here what looks like
the output of a SOAP API.

278
00:10:55,930 --> 00:10:58,380
At this point, this is a
security vulnerability.

279
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:00,210
We're seeing clear text information

280
00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:02,300
from someone else's internet signal

281
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:04,030
using freely available tools

282
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:06,116
and commercial off the shelf equipment.

283
00:11:06,116 --> 00:11:08,170
And that's pretty bad.

284
00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:09,490
They could have sensitive information

285
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:11,530
just in this API string.

286
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:13,340
But as an attacker, what we really want

287
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:15,950
is to see if we can pull
off something even worse.

288
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:18,330
We wanna understand the
semantics of this connection,

289
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:20,740
the nature of the communications.

290
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:22,840
And to do that we have to
delve a bit into the protocols

291
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:23,863
that are being used.

292
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:27,650
So in our research, we've
looked at two protocols,

293
00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:29,220
although there are others out there.

294
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:32,100
The first is called MPEG-TS.

295
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:32,933
Now you might be saying,

296
00:11:32,933 --> 00:11:35,770
"MPEG? Isn't that a
video streaming format?"

297
00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:36,880
And you'd be correct.

298
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,130
MPEG is widely used across the internet

299
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:41,043
for sending videos.

300
00:11:41,043 --> 00:11:44,290
It's used for satellite television
video feeds, for example.

301
00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:45,220
And over the years,

302
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:47,620
people have added all
kinds of weird additions.

303
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:48,880
They've added the ability

304
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,680
to pause a live satellite television

305
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:56,030
or update your set top boxes
firmware over these feeds.

306
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:58,960
And these functionalities
have been hacked together,

307
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:02,050
offer interactivity and internet services.

308
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:05,470
And so inside all of these
layers of weird protocols,

309
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:07,680
you have a fairly
standard container format

310
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,630
that there's a lot of great
tools for working with.

311
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:13,130
And so, in fact, if you're really lucky

312
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:15,670
and you get a high quality
signal to noise ratio,

313
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:16,503
you may just be able

314
00:12:16,503 --> 00:12:18,480
to open that file we saved in the desktop

315
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,960
directly in Wireshark and
start seeing real packets.

316
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:24,200
This is where prior research focused,

317
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,950
because it was a pretty
straightforward process

318
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:27,980
to line up all the tools correctly.

319
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:29,500
And then you could spend most of your time

320
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:30,830
looking at the contents of the traffic,

321
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:32,530
which is the interesting bit.

322
00:12:32,530 --> 00:12:35,580
However, MPEG-TS is still a used standard

323
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:36,413
for satellite internet,

324
00:12:36,413 --> 00:12:39,110
but it's getting replaced
by newer protocols like GSC

325
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:41,250
or Generic Stream Encapsulation.

326
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:43,600
GSE makes a lot more sense.

327
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,640
It essentially has an IP layer,

328
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,860
which is embedded inside
of this generic stream,

329
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:49,280
which is broken up into fragments

330
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,170
and then put directly

331
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:52,320
into that digital video broadcasting feed.

332
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,740
So you have none of the
weird MPEG characteristics

333
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:56,120
that are intended for video streaming

334
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,633
around relevant internet.

335
00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:00,440
We found that it was particularly popular

336
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,920
among enterprise customers.

337
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,190
So people who had an entire
satellite transponder

338
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:06,550
for their network, think
like maritime customers

339
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:08,230
or aviation customers.

340
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:10,880
But these customers also
had much better equipment

341
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:11,713
than we do.

342
00:13:11,713 --> 00:13:14,300
They would spend tens to
hundreds of thousands of dollars

343
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:16,060
on signal processing hardware.

344
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:19,400
Whereas we're using like
200 bucks of a PCIe card.

345
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,560
And so when we were trying
to receive these signals,

346
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:24,090
we were often missing
fragments of IP packets

347
00:13:24,090 --> 00:13:25,770
and had super corrupted feeds,

348
00:13:25,770 --> 00:13:27,050
which meant that existing tools

349
00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:29,210
weren't able to parse
these signals for us.

350
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:31,840
We didn't get much help in that regard.

351
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,100
So what we did instead

352
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:36,240
is build our own tool called GSExtract.

353
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,120
And the goal of GSExtract

354
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:41,500
is to forensically reconstruct, PCAP files

355
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:44,650
from corrupted recordings of GSE feeds.

356
00:13:44,650 --> 00:13:47,360
And it does this by taking some shortcuts.

357
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,200
If we were designing a satellite modem,

358
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,270
we would have to consider
all of the edge cases

359
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:54,140
and how a network operates
or how a packet gets sent.

360
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:55,790
But for GSExtract, we can say,

361
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:58,240
generally, we would expect
the start of an IP packet

362
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,380
to appear here,

363
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:02,920
or we would expect this fragment
to belong to this payload.

364
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:04,650
And by making some of those assumptions,

365
00:14:04,650 --> 00:14:07,750
GSExtract is able to help
us figure out what to do

366
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:10,630
with between 50 and 70% of the frames

367
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:12,230
that are hitting our dish.

368
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:15,210
This is significantly
better than existing tool,

369
00:14:15,210 --> 00:14:16,470
which are just throwing error message

370
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:18,120
because the feed is so corrupted.

371
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:22,230
Hopefully, by the time that
you're watching this recording,

372
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:25,696
GSExtract will be available
on my research group's GitHub.

373
00:14:25,696 --> 00:14:27,550
It may take a little bit longer,

374
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:28,680
because we're still doing

375
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:31,930
some responsible disclosure
review process stuff,

376
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:33,850
but we should eventually end up there.

377
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:34,683
In the interim,

378
00:14:34,683 --> 00:14:37,180
if you wanna delve into how
it works a little bit deeper,

379
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:39,520
it's described in pretty high detail

380
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:40,940
in a related academic paper

381
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:42,270
that we published a few months ago

382
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:43,843
in the appendix of that paper.

383
00:14:45,530 --> 00:14:47,920
So this is what you get
at the end of the day

384
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,130
by using GSExtract.

385
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:51,330
This is a JPEG file that we intercepted

386
00:14:51,330 --> 00:14:54,310
from an engineer aboard a maritime vessel

387
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:55,930
who is dealing with a maintenance issue

388
00:14:55,930 --> 00:14:58,150
and sending pictures to his colleagues.

389
00:14:58,150 --> 00:15:00,350
You'll see that we're able to
get the start of the packet.

390
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:02,850
We're able to figure
out, this is a JPEG file,

391
00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:04,333
we knew what port it was going to.

392
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:06,217
We knew the nature of the communications,

393
00:15:06,217 --> 00:15:08,830
but at some point we
start losing fragments

394
00:15:08,830 --> 00:15:11,260
and then in the case of a
compressed file like this,

395
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:13,260
we aren't able to get everything.

396
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:15,760
That said, the first chunk of an IP paleo

397
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,390
often has the most interesting bits.

398
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:18,970
It may be the entire packet,

399
00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:20,640
or it maybe the parts that you care about

400
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,880
from a session log in or something.

401
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,080
And so we think this is
still useful to an attacker,

402
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:27,310
even if it's not 100% recovery

403
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:29,417
and allows someone to get away with $200

404
00:15:29,417 --> 00:15:31,800
or $300 of home television equipment

405
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:32,700
and do harm

406
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:35,060
that they would otherwise need
tens of thousands of dollars

407
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:36,703
to play with in these networks.

408
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:41,580
All right. So at this
point, we're in a good spot.

409
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:46,060
We have a satellite dish that
we can use to talk to signals.

410
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:47,240
We know that if those signals

411
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:49,850
are in the digital video
broadcasting for satellite format,

412
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:52,560
which is very common
from geostationary orbit,

413
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:56,240
we can parse that using that
PCIe card on our computer.

414
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,390
Depending on the contents
of those streams,

415
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:01,980
we can use existing tools
like dvbsnoop or Wireshark

416
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:04,980
or tools we've written
ourselves like GSExtract

417
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:07,320
to get meaningful pcap data out of it

418
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:09,830
and understand the
internet traffic inside.

419
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:12,030
The next step is really
to understand the impact

420
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:13,130
of what we found.

421
00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:15,030
How does this affect modern users

422
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:17,860
of terrestrial satellite
communications, maritime,

423
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:19,833
and aviation communication links.

424
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:22,930
So across all three of these domains,

425
00:16:22,930 --> 00:16:24,650
there are a couple of
general things we found

426
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:26,380
that are worth highlighting.

427
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:28,850
The first is that none
of the ISPs we looked at

428
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:31,520
appeared to employ encryption by default.

429
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:33,650
That is to say that individual customers

430
00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:35,388
might choose to encrypt their traffic,

431
00:16:35,388 --> 00:16:38,840
but the satellite ISP were
sending over the satellite feed

432
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:40,900
traffic in essentially the same format

433
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:42,450
that was coming into the modem.

434
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:45,530
What this means is that as an attacker,

435
00:16:45,530 --> 00:16:48,650
we had an ISP level vantage
point on the traffic

436
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:50,200
that was coming to a customer.

437
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,940
We saw every website they visited,

438
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:53,880
every bit torrent they downloaded,

439
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,310
every connection they made,

440
00:16:55,310 --> 00:16:57,970
would pass over that satellite
link and we would get it.

441
00:16:57,970 --> 00:16:59,850
But when we looked at
the enterprise customers,

442
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:01,420
this got even more interesting.

443
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:03,210
Because a lot of these enterprise networks

444
00:17:03,210 --> 00:17:05,450
operate basically as a land environment

445
00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:07,230
across the satellite feed.

446
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:09,340
A good example is a cruise
line we were looking at

447
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:12,170
that had Windows machines
on all of their ships

448
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:15,270
and the internal Windows LDAP
traffic from that network,

449
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:17,270
that windows local area environment,

450
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:19,830
was being broadcast
across the satellite feed.

451
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:21,870
Getting to see Windows to Windows,

452
00:17:21,870 --> 00:17:25,230
corporate land communications
as a wireless eavesdropper

453
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:26,520
is really unusual.

454
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:28,760
And we thought it was a
particularly interesting angle

455
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,410
'cause it got us behind the firewall

456
00:17:30,410 --> 00:17:32,743
of a lot of these big
corporations networks.

457
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:36,090
So the first environment
I wanna talk about,

458
00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:38,590
the first domain is terrestrial customers.

459
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:40,010
And these were really interesting to us

460
00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:41,050
because they're real people.

461
00:17:41,050 --> 00:17:42,714
They're your home internet users

462
00:17:42,714 --> 00:17:44,830
and they care about privacy.

463
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:46,900
Now, I know what you might be saying.

464
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,610
You might say, "Wait a second,

465
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:50,820
my browser has this lock icon on it,

466
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:53,110
which says that my traffic is encrypted.

467
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:56,230
What could an eavesdropper
do to cause harm to me?"

468
00:17:56,230 --> 00:17:59,750
And I would say to you,
convenient made up straw man,

469
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:02,400
that there's actually a
lot that an attacker can do

470
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,850
to mess with your
communications in this context.

471
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:08,140
So even though we can't see exactly

472
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:10,080
the content of your communications,

473
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,390
we get to see your DNS
queries for example,

474
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:14,800
which is essentially every
website you're visiting.

475
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:18,300
And we can use that to piece
together your browsing history.

476
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:20,410
Additionally, those TLS certificates

477
00:18:20,410 --> 00:18:22,490
that you think are protecting your traffic

478
00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:24,600
are protecting the
contents of that traffic,

479
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:27,020
but they're fingerprinting
the websites you're visiting,

480
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:27,853
which allowed us

481
00:18:27,853 --> 00:18:30,680
to determine which
networks devices belong to

482
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:33,220
or generally where users were going.

483
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:35,100
Now, this is a mild privacy concern,

484
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:36,500
you don't want an entire continent

485
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,370
to hear your browsing history,

486
00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:40,560
but it gets worse when you slip up.

487
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,430
One of the most illustrative
examples of this

488
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:43,820
comes from a lawyer

489
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:46,610
whose emails we intercepted
across this feed.

490
00:18:46,610 --> 00:18:48,730
So this lawyer in Spain was communicating

491
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:51,030
with one of his clients
about an upcoming court case.

492
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:53,240
He happened to be a defense attorney.

493
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:56,360
And we intercepted the emails
that were going to his inbox

494
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:58,630
'cause he was using POP3 to download them

495
00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:01,540
over the satellite link.

496
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:05,130
And so this is obviously bad
news for that attorney's client

497
00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:06,400
and for attorney/client privilege

498
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,810
and customer privacy in
general and all of that.

499
00:19:08,810 --> 00:19:11,310
But it gets a little bit
worse if we think about it

500
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:14,650
in the context of everything
else we know about this lawyer.

501
00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:17,330
Because we also know what
other websites he was visiting.

502
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:20,950
And so we can say, "Hey, this
lawyer goes to paypal.com."

503
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:22,880
We see that from his DNS queries,

504
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,470
we have his email address

505
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:26,770
and we can read everything
that goes through his inbox.

506
00:19:26,770 --> 00:19:30,170
We can go and hit the "Reset
my password" link on PayPal

507
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:32,330
and essentially hijack his accounts.

508
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:34,450
This demonstrates how a
man in the middle attacker

509
00:19:34,450 --> 00:19:36,270
who's listening to your entire connection,

510
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:38,710
who's essentially an
internet service provider,

511
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:41,230
can engage in attacks that
are way more sophisticated

512
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:43,760
than someone who's just
eavesdropping in a single connection

513
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,113
to an insecure service.

514
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:50,120
So the other thing we were
curious about were IOT systems

515
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,590
'cause these didn't really exist

516
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:53,600
when people were looking
at these feeds last time,

517
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,230
especially in the electricity

518
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:57,600
and critical infrastructure domain.

519
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,970
We found that a lot of operators

520
00:19:58,970 --> 00:20:01,890
seem to be using these
networks under the assumption

521
00:20:01,890 --> 00:20:04,430
that they were secure
against eavesdropping.

522
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:05,440
A great example of this

523
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,990
is a major electricity provider in Europe

524
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:11,700
who had this HTTP basic
authentication login

525
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:13,020
that you see on the left

526
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:14,720
to access the Cisco router

527
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,240
inside their networks configuration page.

528
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:19,190
And I blacked out all of
the sensitive information,

529
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:21,120
but clearly this is a clear text,

530
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,060
admin username and credential

531
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:25,224
that could probably change
some settings on that router.

532
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:26,780
And if you have a keen eye,

533
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:28,700
you'll see that the host IP address

534
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:30,770
for this router is publicly routable,

535
00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:32,870
meaning that anyone with
an internet connection

536
00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:35,554
could use these credentials
to log into the device.

537
00:20:35,554 --> 00:20:38,640
Very similarly, I touched
on this at the beginning,

538
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,020
there are a lot of wind turbines

539
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:41,460
that use satellite connections

540
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:42,820
because they're in remote locations

541
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:45,280
and they all have
terrestrial internet access.

542
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,910
And what we found is that a lot of them

543
00:20:46,910 --> 00:20:48,250
have these control panels

544
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:50,930
that were used to configure the devices

545
00:20:50,930 --> 00:20:53,100
that were being sent
over the satellite feed.

546
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:55,300
And these control panels
are publicly routable

547
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:56,930
over the open internet.

548
00:20:56,930 --> 00:20:58,620
So we could get these credentials

549
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:00,140
that were being leaked in clear text

550
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:01,040
over the satellite feed,

551
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:04,310
whether that'd be a login
cookie or username and password,

552
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:06,730
and combine it with
any internet connection

553
00:21:06,730 --> 00:21:08,160
to potentially start messing around

554
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:10,220
with these power generation facilities.

555
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:12,260
Now, obviously we didn't
engage in any attacks

556
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:13,730
on electrical grid system

557
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:15,820
so there could be another
protection when you log in

558
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:17,564
as some sort of second factor control,

559
00:21:17,564 --> 00:21:19,940
but I think it's intuitively concerning

560
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:22,240
that this stuff is getting
sent in clear text.

561
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:25,760
So heading out to sea for a moment,

562
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:28,010
I think one of the most
interesting things for us

563
00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:29,270
about the maritime case

564
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:31,920
was how unique every
boat in the network is.

565
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:34,420
So we had these terabytes
and terabytes of traffic

566
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:35,990
from all kinds of different companies

567
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:37,550
and all kinds of different ships.

568
00:21:37,550 --> 00:21:40,060
And what we really wanted
to do was figure out a way

569
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:43,300
to tie an IP address in
this massive pcap file

570
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:45,000
to a specific boat in the ocean

571
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,030
to figure out what it was doing.

572
00:21:47,030 --> 00:21:49,230
So we picked 100 random IP addresses

573
00:21:49,230 --> 00:21:51,010
from the thousands that we had,

574
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:52,550
and we set ourselves a little challenge.

575
00:21:52,550 --> 00:21:55,370
We designed a fingerprint
based off of DNS queries

576
00:21:55,370 --> 00:21:57,830
and TLS certificates
and a couple of strings

577
00:21:57,830 --> 00:22:00,130
for the first few
kilobytes of their traffic

578
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:01,370
and we used that to see

579
00:22:01,370 --> 00:22:04,930
if we could de-anonymize IP
addresses and identify ships.

580
00:22:04,930 --> 00:22:08,200
This very basic manual
process was sufficient

581
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:11,097
to de-anonymize 10% of the
vessels in that case study.

582
00:22:11,097 --> 00:22:12,514
So we de-anonymized 12 vessels,

583
00:22:12,514 --> 00:22:14,270
I've hidden their names here

584
00:22:14,270 --> 00:22:16,566
because I wanna maintain
the privacy of their owners,

585
00:22:16,566 --> 00:22:18,910
but you get a real sense for the breadth

586
00:22:18,910 --> 00:22:21,950
of the type of ships
impacted by this research.

587
00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:24,010
So the smallest fleet that we listened to

588
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:25,780
was this fishing fleet here,

589
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:27,027
which had a single fishing vessel

590
00:22:27,027 --> 00:22:29,460
and was using some software
over the satellite feed

591
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:30,670
to help it find fish.

592
00:22:30,670 --> 00:22:32,820
I'm not really sure how it works.

593
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:35,350
On the flip side, we had
this enormous container ship,

594
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:37,220
one of the larger container
ships in the world,

595
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:39,100
belonging to one of the
largest shipping companies

596
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:40,160
in the world.

597
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:43,450
And it's operating within
the same IP address space

598
00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:45,023
as that random fishing crew.

599
00:22:46,050 --> 00:22:48,160
Beyond being able to
identify which companies

600
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,920
and organizations are affected,

601
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,140
another cool thing we could do

602
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:54,840
is fingerprint operational
technology aboard the vessel.

603
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:57,910
Good example is this subsea
repair ship down here,

604
00:22:57,910 --> 00:23:00,470
which was owned by a
major petroleum company.

605
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:01,870
And we were able to identify

606
00:23:01,870 --> 00:23:04,140
from the traffic inside those pcap files,

607
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:05,800
that there was a device on board the ship

608
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:09,270
running a vulnerable version
of Windows Server 2003,

609
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:10,590
that had all kinds of CVEs

610
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:12,290
that could be deployed against it.

611
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:15,240
At this point, if we
wanted to attack that ship,

612
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:17,190
we could potentially deploy CVEs,

613
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:18,520
not just against that one,

614
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:22,370
but against any ship in this
petroleum company's fleet

615
00:23:22,370 --> 00:23:24,763
and potentially cause some serious harm.

616
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:29,060
So another piece of operational technology

617
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:30,260
we were curious about

618
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:32,100
was something called
Electronic Chart Display

619
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:34,950
and Information Systems or ECDIS.

620
00:23:34,950 --> 00:23:39,050
And ECDIS are essentially
GPS map terminals for boats.

621
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:41,700
They tell boats where they
can go safely or legally,

622
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:44,750
they have various hazard
updates for mariners

623
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:47,264
and there's been a lot of great
research on securing them.

624
00:23:47,264 --> 00:23:48,760
There're actually formats out there

625
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,840
to stop people from
tampering with these charts

626
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:54,050
using various cryptographic
authenticity guarantees.

627
00:23:54,050 --> 00:23:56,494
Unfortunately, we saw that
a lot of maritime operators

628
00:23:56,494 --> 00:24:00,250
were using older or proprietary
versions of these formats

629
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:01,980
that did not have protections

630
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:04,670
against tampering attacks
that we could see.

631
00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:07,010
Now, you might be saying,
"Why does this matter?"

632
00:24:07,010 --> 00:24:08,300
You can get free nautical charts

633
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:09,840
and maybe save a couple hundred bucks

634
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,910
if you wanna go on a sailing expedition,

635
00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:13,910
but can you really mess with this data

636
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:15,610
as somebody who's just passively listening

637
00:24:15,610 --> 00:24:17,230
to a satellite connection?

638
00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:18,530
It turns out that you can.

639
00:24:18,530 --> 00:24:21,380
Because a lot of these
are updated insecurely.

640
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:23,520
A great example is this ship,

641
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:26,920
which had a publicly
routable FTP server on board.

642
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:28,410
And the way that we
get their chart updates

643
00:24:28,410 --> 00:24:30,195
is someone on land in the back office

644
00:24:30,195 --> 00:24:32,470
would copy the latest chart files

645
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:35,420
into a folder called Chart
Delivery on the FTP server.

646
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:38,760
And then it would get deployed
to the ECDIS terminal.

647
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:41,480
Now, because it's FTP servers
accessible over the internet,

648
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:44,220
anyone with an internet
connection can connect to it.

649
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:45,610
And the password is getting sent

650
00:24:45,610 --> 00:24:47,380
in clear text over the satellite feed,

651
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:49,090
cause they didn't use SFTP.

652
00:24:49,090 --> 00:24:52,020
And so it would be pretty
trivial to send a false chart

653
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:55,220
to this folder or even
deploy targeted malware.

654
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:58,550
Another common way that charts
get update is via emails.

655
00:24:58,550 --> 00:24:59,850
And generally there's an email address

656
00:24:59,850 --> 00:25:04,830
like
chartupdates_shipname@shipcompany.org,

657
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:06,300
which will get updates

658
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:08,910
every so often as
attachments to the inbox,

659
00:25:08,910 --> 00:25:11,250
the captain will copy those
files onto a flash drive,

660
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:13,480
walk over to the ECDIS
terminal, plug it in

661
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:15,053
and update the information.

662
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:17,780
That's not inherently insecure,

663
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:19,020
but if you're like this captain

664
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:21,470
and you use an insecure email protocol,

665
00:25:21,470 --> 00:25:23,150
then we get a pretty good template

666
00:25:23,150 --> 00:25:25,580
for a targeted social
engineering operation

667
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:29,040
that might persuade you to copy
malicious charts or malware

668
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:31,963
onto your own vessel's critical
operational technology.

669
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:35,740
Beyond this operational technology,

670
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:37,190
I think it's important to remember

671
00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:39,780
that there are real
people aboard these ships

672
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:41,900
who have real privacy concerns.

673
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:45,000
Like billionaires sailing
around on their super yachts.

674
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,767
Now I know getting up
at DEFCON and saying,

675
00:25:46,767 --> 00:25:49,680
"Think of the billionaires"
is not a great starting point,

676
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:51,500
but this was a really fun case study

677
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:53,980
that I wanna delve into a little bit.

678
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:55,490
So we were listening to this traffic

679
00:25:55,490 --> 00:25:58,040
from this Greek billionaire's mega yacht

680
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:00,690
and there were all kinds
of interesting anecdotes

681
00:26:00,690 --> 00:26:01,700
that came up in the traffic

682
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:04,060
that really painted a
picture of what was going on.

683
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:06,470
For example, one day the
captain of this yacht

684
00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:09,280
forgot the login to his Microsoft account.

685
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:12,380
And so the credentials
for that captain's account

686
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:14,480
came across a satellite feed in clear text

687
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,910
in the format of an account reset link.

688
00:26:16,910 --> 00:26:19,090
Now, at this point, we
could hijack the account

689
00:26:19,090 --> 00:26:21,110
of someone who has a reason to communicate

690
00:26:21,110 --> 00:26:23,200
with a very high net worth individual

691
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,210
and potentially engage
in some super targeted

692
00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:26,930
social engineering attacks.

693
00:26:26,930 --> 00:26:28,430
Because the captain's email address

694
00:26:28,430 --> 00:26:30,020
included the name of the yacht,

695
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:31,930
we could also very easily identify

696
00:26:31,930 --> 00:26:34,363
which billionaire was
affected by this traffic.

697
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:37,880
Additionally, once we've had de-anonymized

698
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:39,290
the owner of this yacht,

699
00:26:39,290 --> 00:26:40,950
there were other things
we could piece together.

700
00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:42,760
For example, the yacht used software

701
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:46,370
to manage lunch orders and
stuff for the crew members

702
00:26:46,370 --> 00:26:47,310
and for guests.

703
00:26:47,310 --> 00:26:49,390
And so we could see who this
billionaire was inviting

704
00:26:49,390 --> 00:26:51,310
on their yacht or where they were going,

705
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:54,040
or even what they were eating
for lunch on a particular day,

706
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:55,790
which is not inherently sensitive,

707
00:26:55,790 --> 00:26:57,510
but if you're hiding who you're meeting

708
00:26:57,510 --> 00:26:58,990
and you don't want an entire continent

709
00:26:58,990 --> 00:27:00,440
to know about your social life,

710
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:03,460
it could be a little bit
concerning for these individuals.

711
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:04,790
Beyond the billionaires though,

712
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:08,360
there are also regular people
on vessels across the sea

713
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:10,400
who have privacy concerns.

714
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,370
Another privacy thing that we encountered

715
00:27:12,370 --> 00:27:14,720
was what looked like point
of sale terminal traffic

716
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,000
coming off of cruise ships

717
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,260
from a major European cruise operator.

718
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:20,900
And I don't know if there were
credit card numbers in here

719
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:23,100
so I've censored the data very heavily.

720
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:25,010
A lot of the numbers
did pass the loon check,

721
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:26,647
but it could have been coincidental.

722
00:27:26,647 --> 00:27:27,700
At the very least,

723
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:30,100
anything that tells you how
much someone paid for a soda,

724
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:30,933
what their name was

725
00:27:30,933 --> 00:27:33,200
and when they did it is
pretty deeply concerning

726
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,250
that it's being broadcast

727
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:36,523
across an entire continent in clear text.

728
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:39,280
Another example of sensitive information

729
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:40,923
from real people on cruise ships

730
00:27:40,923 --> 00:27:43,290
or on vessels would be

731
00:27:43,290 --> 00:27:45,830
when ports have cargo vessels come in,

732
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:49,610
they often require the crew to
share some visa information.

733
00:27:49,610 --> 00:27:51,440
And this particular port authority thought

734
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:52,310
that a great way to do that

735
00:27:52,310 --> 00:27:55,110
would be an insecure HTTP web service.

736
00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:55,943
And so as a result,

737
00:27:55,943 --> 00:27:58,740
we could see from the cargo
vessels pulling into this port,

738
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:00,810
all of the names and passport numbers

739
00:28:00,810 --> 00:28:03,840
and date of birth of the crew
members of what these ships.

740
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:06,200
Obviously this is deeply
sensitive information

741
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:08,620
that should have been encrypted.

742
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:10,560
All right, let's head out to the skies.

743
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:13,590
So the aviation use space
is really interesting to me

744
00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:15,080
because it's the newest one.

745
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:17,430
We were gonna do this
as our 2020 experiment.

746
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:18,940
We're gonna get all kinds of great data

747
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:20,400
from airplanes this year

748
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,740
and really get a feeling
for how aviation intersects

749
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:25,180
with satellite communication security.

750
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:26,330
And we started out great.

751
00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:27,420
We had some great traffic

752
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:30,170
from these inflight entertainment
systems in February,

753
00:28:30,170 --> 00:28:32,040
we're super excited for the year

754
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:34,960
and then everyone stopped flying.

755
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:37,730
The number of people in
airplanes sank dramatically

756
00:28:37,730 --> 00:28:38,620
because of the pandemic.

757
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:41,510
And so the amount of traffic
we were getting also tanked.

758
00:28:41,510 --> 00:28:43,870
I was originally pretty salty about this,

759
00:28:43,870 --> 00:28:44,710
but then I realized

760
00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:47,430
that there's actually
a silver lining here.

761
00:28:47,430 --> 00:28:49,140
You see, back in February,

762
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:50,890
the traffic we were seeing was a lot,

763
00:28:50,890 --> 00:28:52,130
but it was mostly garbage.

764
00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:54,540
It was people checking
their Facebook on a flight,

765
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:55,490
which isn't that interesting

766
00:28:55,490 --> 00:28:57,660
from a security researcher perspective.

767
00:28:57,660 --> 00:29:00,250
But in April when the
airplanes were flying empty,

768
00:29:00,250 --> 00:29:02,240
almost all of the
traffic in these networks

769
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:05,260
was somehow essential to either
the operation of the airline

770
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:06,450
or the operation of the airplane.

771
00:29:06,450 --> 00:29:08,860
There were no passengers
to generate noise.

772
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:10,620
And even as passenger counts increase,

773
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:12,030
the passengers we saw

774
00:29:12,030 --> 00:29:14,190
tended to be high value
business executives,

775
00:29:14,190 --> 00:29:16,120
as opposed to just random tourists,

776
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:17,940
which made the traffic a
little bit more interesting

777
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:20,140
from a privacy perspective.

778
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:22,470
Now, because we had
this unique opportunity,

779
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:24,030
there was something I wanted to test,

780
00:29:24,030 --> 00:29:26,180
which was a claim that
was made by a researcher

781
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:27,630
whose work I really admire.

782
00:29:27,630 --> 00:29:30,470
So Ruben Santamarta does
research in satellite modems.

783
00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:32,110
He's definitely presented at Black-Hat

784
00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:33,400
and DEFCON and stuff,

785
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:35,700
doing a lot of hardware
reverse engineering.

786
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:36,780
And he has this blog post

787
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:38,570
where he looks at inflight
entertainment systems,

788
00:29:38,570 --> 00:29:41,500
including some of the systems
that we received traffic from.

789
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:44,580
And he posited that he
suspects the satellite terminal

790
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:46,650
could be a bridge between
the part of the airplane

791
00:29:46,650 --> 00:29:48,660
that keeps people entertained and happy

792
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:50,500
and the part of the airplane
that keeps it in the sky

793
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:52,340
and going in the right direction.

794
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:54,150
And we wanted to see if there was anything

795
00:29:54,150 --> 00:29:56,670
in these traffic captures
that cross that red line

796
00:29:56,670 --> 00:30:00,210
and cross those two separate
information security domains,

797
00:30:00,210 --> 00:30:01,660
which shouldn't be happening.

798
00:30:02,650 --> 00:30:03,870
We would have missed this

799
00:30:03,870 --> 00:30:05,660
if we had all of that Facebook traffic.

800
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:08,410
We actually had traffic from
this device for several months

801
00:30:08,410 --> 00:30:11,000
and we didn't realize it
until coronavirus hit.

802
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,980
But we found what I'm going
to call the loneliest EFB.

803
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:15,890
So EFB is an Electronic Flight Bag.

804
00:30:15,890 --> 00:30:17,890
It's essentially a information terminal

805
00:30:17,890 --> 00:30:20,067
like an ECDIS terminal but for airplanes.

806
00:30:20,067 --> 00:30:22,020
And it includes navigational information

807
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:23,610
and weather updates and all kinds of stuff

808
00:30:23,610 --> 00:30:26,040
that the pilot needs to manage the flight.

809
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:27,990
And this specific Chinese airline

810
00:30:27,990 --> 00:30:30,950
had made a mistake in
configuring their EFB

811
00:30:30,950 --> 00:30:32,850
such that it wasn't logging in correctly,

812
00:30:32,850 --> 00:30:35,240
someone had fat-fingered
a password or something.

813
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:36,950
And so all of the
requests they were sending

814
00:30:36,950 --> 00:30:38,840
were getting bounced off
of this redirect page

815
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:41,310
from the satellite modem and reaching us.

816
00:30:41,310 --> 00:30:42,400
And we could use that

817
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:44,620
to not only fingerprint how this API works

818
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:46,800
and what data is being
sent from the airplane

819
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,920
and where the airplane was at any time,

820
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:51,410
but we could also identify other vessels

821
00:30:51,410 --> 00:30:54,340
that were using this same device.

822
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:55,430
And even though it seems

823
00:30:55,430 --> 00:30:58,100
to be encrypted over
the air in most cases,

824
00:30:58,100 --> 00:31:00,010
we're able to confirm that the network

825
00:31:00,010 --> 00:31:02,610
that's carrying this
operational technology traffic

826
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:04,910
is the same one as the
person a few rows back

827
00:31:04,910 --> 00:31:06,283
who's browsing Instagram.

828
00:31:08,030 --> 00:31:10,530
Another case that we were
interested in for airplanes

829
00:31:10,530 --> 00:31:11,580
is something called a femtocell.

830
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:13,140
There've been a couple of talks at DEFCON,

831
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:14,690
about it, I think.

832
00:31:14,690 --> 00:31:17,080
And it's essentially a
miniature cell tower,

833
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:19,050
that they put an airplanes
that allows customers

834
00:31:19,050 --> 00:31:22,070
to use their cell phones as
if they were on the ground.

835
00:31:22,070 --> 00:31:25,410
And we saw that the front end
of these is fairly secure,

836
00:31:25,410 --> 00:31:27,740
uses GSM or LTE or whatever,

837
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:30,010
which has some security
guarantees over the air,

838
00:31:30,010 --> 00:31:32,100
but the backend was
being routed un-encrypted

839
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:36,950
in these SCTP wrappers
over the satellite signal.

840
00:31:36,950 --> 00:31:38,810
And so we're able to see

841
00:31:38,810 --> 00:31:41,660
the contents of people's
cellular communications.

842
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:43,320
What's particularly scary about this

843
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:44,153
is that we don't know

844
00:31:44,153 --> 00:31:46,630
if these customers were aware
of what they were doing.

845
00:31:46,630 --> 00:31:49,090
If you forgot to put your
phone into airplane mode,

846
00:31:49,090 --> 00:31:50,700
it's very possible a text message

847
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:52,600
that you received during your flight

848
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:54,170
will show up in our packet captures.

849
00:31:54,170 --> 00:31:55,470
You're not even aware you're connected

850
00:31:55,470 --> 00:31:57,120
to a satellite network.

851
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:00,383
And to bring home the severity,
here's a good example.

852
00:32:00,383 --> 00:32:02,730
There's this person who was on a flight

853
00:32:02,730 --> 00:32:03,640
and in the middle of their flight,

854
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:06,010
they got their negative
coronavirus test result.

855
00:32:06,010 --> 00:32:07,004
Now that's a huge relief

856
00:32:07,004 --> 00:32:09,355
for anyone who's sitting
next to him on the airplane.

857
00:32:09,355 --> 00:32:12,700
But for the rest of us who
care about health data privacy,

858
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:14,250
it's a huge information breach

859
00:32:14,250 --> 00:32:17,010
that this is being sent in
clear text, across a continent.

860
00:32:17,010 --> 00:32:19,010
We saw all kinds of wild text messages.

861
00:32:19,010 --> 00:32:20,916
I remember listening to some guy

862
00:32:20,916 --> 00:32:23,280
who spoke Croatian in his text messages,

863
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:25,050
talking about a wild dream he had

864
00:32:25,050 --> 00:32:26,820
where it's friend's mom showed up

865
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:28,340
in a burning house or something,

866
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:30,700
just real people's personal communications

867
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:32,680
are being sent in clear text.

868
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:34,410
And it's not just personal communications,

869
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:37,580
if you've ever used like
SMS as a second factor

870
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:38,730
for account login,

871
00:32:38,730 --> 00:32:40,670
it's clear how this could be deployed

872
00:32:40,670 --> 00:32:42,220
in an account hijacking attack.

873
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:46,560
So fundamentally, everything
we've done is passive.

874
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:48,320
We haven't gotten any equipment

875
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:49,850
to send signals in these networks,

876
00:32:49,850 --> 00:32:51,600
we don't have a license to do that,

877
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:52,570
but is it possible,

878
00:32:52,570 --> 00:32:55,360
there are other semi-active
or fully active attacks

879
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:57,770
we could deploy against these networks?

880
00:32:57,770 --> 00:33:01,110
One scenario I saw, which
is based off of some malware

881
00:33:01,110 --> 00:33:02,850
that actually has been used in practice

882
00:33:02,850 --> 00:33:05,450
by a Russian ABT group called Turley Group

883
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:06,720
would be to use satellites

884
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:09,413
for untraceable data exfiltration.

885
00:33:09,413 --> 00:33:11,970
And there are only two
requirements for this to play out.

886
00:33:11,970 --> 00:33:13,760
First, you have to compromise the device

887
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:15,410
that you wanna steal data from,

888
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:17,410
and it needs to be connected to a network

889
00:33:17,410 --> 00:33:19,740
that has a route to a
satellite IP address.

890
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:21,350
Generally, the internet is sufficient

891
00:33:21,350 --> 00:33:23,010
because there are a lot
of satellite devices

892
00:33:23,010 --> 00:33:25,050
that have internet routable IP addresses,

893
00:33:25,050 --> 00:33:26,060
but it could also be a device

894
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:27,960
inside someone's land LAN environment.

895
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:30,760
Additionally, as an attacker,

896
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:33,080
you need to be able to be
inside that satellite signal's

897
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:33,913
forward link footprint.

898
00:33:33,913 --> 00:33:35,880
You need to be able to
eavesdrop on the traffic

899
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:37,000
and that's it.

900
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,610
Let's see how this plays out.

901
00:33:38,610 --> 00:33:41,400
So an attacker who's compromised
the device has a problem.

902
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:43,670
They wanna send the
sensitive data they've stolen

903
00:33:43,670 --> 00:33:45,920
to their server somewhere on the internet.

904
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:48,020
The problem is that if they decide

905
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:49,840
to just route this along the internet,

906
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,080
just send a post request

907
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:54,230
with whatever file they have
to a web server they run,

908
00:33:54,230 --> 00:33:57,810
then law enforcement can very
easily trace that post request

909
00:33:57,810 --> 00:34:00,500
and identify where the attackers
commanding control server

910
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:03,400
or data exfiltration database is.

911
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:06,980
But if the attacker uses a
satellite hop as an intermediary,

912
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:09,600
they can really cause some
trouble for law enforcement.

913
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:12,520
Because you see, the compromised
computer with the malware

914
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:15,180
can send the signal to
the satellite customer

915
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:17,060
that will be routed
over the satellite feed.

916
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:19,290
And this customer doesn't
need to be involved at all,

917
00:34:19,290 --> 00:34:21,430
it can just be a random ship in the ocean

918
00:34:21,430 --> 00:34:22,740
that happens to have an IP address.

919
00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:24,620
It doesn't even need a
service running at that port,

920
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:27,400
it could be a closed court
or broken connection.

921
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:29,120
And what will happen as the satellite

922
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:30,330
will beam that signal down

923
00:34:30,330 --> 00:34:32,070
across its footprint area

924
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:36,600
and if a law enforcement officer
tries to investigate this,

925
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:40,180
they'll see it reach this broken
surface on a maritime ship

926
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:42,860
and have no idea where it's gone.

927
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:44,860
Meanwhile, behind the scenes,

928
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:47,470
the attacker can be using a satellite dish

929
00:34:47,470 --> 00:34:49,250
to eavesdrop on that connection

930
00:34:49,250 --> 00:34:51,900
and leak information in clear text.

931
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:53,090
Even if the satellite network

932
00:34:53,090 --> 00:34:54,380
had some degree of encryption,

933
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:57,230
which there are some
networks out there that do,

934
00:34:57,230 --> 00:34:59,330
the attacker might still be able to use

935
00:34:59,330 --> 00:35:00,960
even just like the size of packets

936
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:03,970
or the contents of packets
or the existence of packets

937
00:35:03,970 --> 00:35:06,590
as a signal that's virtually untraceable

938
00:35:06,590 --> 00:35:07,780
because there are somewhere

939
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:10,020
in this massive continent-sized footprint

940
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:12,570
and that's all law enforcement
could possibly know.

941
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:15,480
Another attack that we tried to pull off

942
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:17,840
is something called TCP Session Hijacking,

943
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:20,118
which is a very classic networking attack.

944
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:22,810
Essentially TCP has
this three way handshake

945
00:35:22,810 --> 00:35:24,000
to set up connections

946
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,770
where you have to know
these randomly selected

947
00:35:25,770 --> 00:35:28,220
sequence numbers to prove
you are who you say you are.

948
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:31,020
And what we found is that in
certain satellite environments,

949
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:33,410
you could actually impersonate
one of these end points,

950
00:35:33,410 --> 00:35:36,410
very reliably due to the
physical characteristics of orbit

951
00:35:36,410 --> 00:35:39,590
and hijack orbitary TCP session numbers.

952
00:35:39,590 --> 00:35:42,030
We did this against our own
connection to one device

953
00:35:42,030 --> 00:35:43,800
in one specific satellite network,

954
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,320
but we didn't test it
at a very broad scale

955
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:47,610
cause we didn't wanna mess
with anything important.

956
00:35:47,610 --> 00:35:49,770
Let me give you a show of how this works

957
00:35:49,770 --> 00:35:51,330
from a physical perspective.

958
00:35:51,330 --> 00:35:53,060
So let's take a look.

959
00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:55,590
So just like before, we
have someone in Ireland,

960
00:35:55,590 --> 00:35:57,017
only this time they're
in a maritime office

961
00:35:57,017 --> 00:35:58,660
that wants to visit a website

962
00:35:58,660 --> 00:36:01,710
that's hosted in the cargo
vessel with status information.

963
00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:04,820
So what they'll do is
they'll send a TCP SYN number

964
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:07,470
as a start to the TCP through a handshake.

965
00:36:07,470 --> 00:36:09,870
And this has a sequence
number that you have to know

966
00:36:09,870 --> 00:36:12,010
to prove that you received
the start of the handshake

967
00:36:12,010 --> 00:36:13,940
and that you're a party
to this conversation.

968
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:15,600
This is like a very fundamental protection

969
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:17,650
against spoofing attacks.

970
00:36:17,650 --> 00:36:20,120
However, our attacker can
easily get the sequence number

971
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:22,300
over the un-encrypted satellite link

972
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:23,960
and that the next step, our attacker,

973
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:26,240
remember, how I said they
were in Accra in Ghana?

974
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,270
So Accra happens

975
00:36:27,270 --> 00:36:30,750
to have some of the fastest
terrestrial internet in Africa

976
00:36:30,750 --> 00:36:32,450
and a direct backbone link to the UK,

977
00:36:32,450 --> 00:36:34,430
although that doesn't necessarily matter.

978
00:36:34,430 --> 00:36:36,630
But because the speed of
light is only so fast,

979
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:39,150
the attacker 100% of the time

980
00:36:39,150 --> 00:36:41,340
can beat the legitimate
acknowledgement message

981
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:44,590
from that handshake to our
maritime office in Ireland.

982
00:36:44,590 --> 00:36:45,423
And at this point,

983
00:36:45,423 --> 00:36:47,860
the maritime office will
start a conversation

984
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:49,760
thinking they're talking to the vessel

985
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:52,680
when they're actually sending
information to our attacker.

986
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:53,720
Our attacker can continue

987
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:56,040
to eavesdrop over the satellite link

988
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:58,470
and that message with their
spoofed acknowledgement

989
00:36:58,470 --> 00:37:00,520
will reach the ship at sea,
who will simply ignore it,

990
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:02,380
because it has incorrect sequence numbers.

991
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:04,290
But our attacker at
this point has free rein

992
00:37:04,290 --> 00:37:06,010
to send whatever information they want

993
00:37:06,010 --> 00:37:07,290
to the maritime office

994
00:37:07,290 --> 00:37:08,410
and impersonate the ship

995
00:37:08,410 --> 00:37:10,170
in a way that is virtually undetectable,

996
00:37:10,170 --> 00:37:12,943
if you're not employing some
certificate signing scheme.

997
00:37:14,530 --> 00:37:17,690
So this is a very simple example

998
00:37:17,690 --> 00:37:19,780
that shows that even though
we can't transmit directly

999
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:21,080
in a satellite network,

1000
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:22,890
we're fundamentally a
part of a broader network,

1001
00:37:22,890 --> 00:37:23,900
which is the internet.

1002
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:24,860
And in that environment,

1003
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:27,490
active attacks are definitely possible.

1004
00:37:27,490 --> 00:37:30,610
So obviously this research
has some ethical implications,

1005
00:37:30,610 --> 00:37:32,490
it's a real world
networks and real people.

1006
00:37:32,490 --> 00:37:34,420
So we're very careful
to adhere to the laws

1007
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:35,830
and go above and beyond that.

1008
00:37:35,830 --> 00:37:37,400
You might be a little disappointed today

1009
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,660
that I haven't made and
shamed any companies,

1010
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:40,870
that's a conscious choice

1011
00:37:40,870 --> 00:37:41,703
because I don't want this

1012
00:37:41,703 --> 00:37:43,960
to be about X airline
is leaking your data.

1013
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:45,250
I want the focus to be on the fact

1014
00:37:45,250 --> 00:37:46,600
that this is a systemic issue

1015
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:49,130
that affects a lot,
thousands, tens of thousands,

1016
00:37:49,130 --> 00:37:51,900
of satellite customers around the world.

1017
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:53,890
We've of course engaged
in responsible disclosure.

1018
00:37:53,890 --> 00:37:55,830
Many of the satellite
companies have known about this

1019
00:37:55,830 --> 00:37:58,627
as early as 2019, as well
as some of their customers

1020
00:37:58,627 --> 00:38:00,450
who have leaked particularly
interesting data

1021
00:38:00,450 --> 00:38:01,723
or are particularly large.

1022
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:03,950
Most people were receptive to this.

1023
00:38:03,950 --> 00:38:05,400
We talked to a lot of CISOs

1024
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:06,890
who have started changing
around their networks.

1025
00:38:06,890 --> 00:38:08,040
We don't know exactly what they're doing,

1026
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:09,580
but at least they're aware of the risks.

1027
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:11,710
And we only had one
company threaten to sue us,

1028
00:38:11,710 --> 00:38:12,620
which is really good

1029
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:16,210
for this systemic cybersecurity research.

1030
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:18,950
We got a huge boost to
responsible disclosure,

1031
00:38:18,950 --> 00:38:21,090
courtesy of the Federal
Bureau of Investigation

1032
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:22,940
who releases threat
intelligence notification

1033
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:25,150
to the maritime industry.

1034
00:38:25,150 --> 00:38:27,320
And what's really interesting
about this notification

1035
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:29,930
is that it showed up online from the FBI

1036
00:38:29,930 --> 00:38:32,480
almost a month before our academic paper

1037
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:34,990
was publicly available.

1038
00:38:34,990 --> 00:38:37,560
So the only people who had
access to this PDF file

1039
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:39,450
were people who were
responsibly disclosed to

1040
00:38:39,450 --> 00:38:41,810
with the request that they keep it private

1041
00:38:41,810 --> 00:38:44,300
and our academic peer reviewers.

1042
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:48,090
Yet somehow the FBI was able
to cite specific information

1043
00:38:48,090 --> 00:38:50,180
from a chart inside that paper.

1044
00:38:50,180 --> 00:38:52,700
Now as a researcher, this
is a little bit unsettling,

1045
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:55,510
how to did the FBI get my paper
before I gave it to anyone?

1046
00:38:55,510 --> 00:38:56,650
But if you're ever wondering

1047
00:38:56,650 --> 00:38:59,690
if you should join one of these
threat intelligence schemes,

1048
00:38:59,690 --> 00:39:01,970
it's clear that the FBI does a good job

1049
00:39:01,970 --> 00:39:04,580
at getting a scoop ahead of the industry

1050
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:08,120
or even the researchers themselves
thinking it's out there.

1051
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:10,250
So how do we protect against
these attacks going forward?

1052
00:39:10,250 --> 00:39:12,210
How do we defend these networks?

1053
00:39:12,210 --> 00:39:13,330
Well, I think we need to understand

1054
00:39:13,330 --> 00:39:15,300
why these kinds of attacks can happen.

1055
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:16,290
And it's easy to say it's

1056
00:39:16,290 --> 00:39:17,930
'cause satellite operators are ignorant,

1057
00:39:17,930 --> 00:39:19,920
but the reality is more complicated.

1058
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:22,430
Remember when I said the speed
of light is only so fast,

1059
00:39:22,430 --> 00:39:25,070
that means that sending a
signal to space is slow,

1060
00:39:25,070 --> 00:39:27,500
which makes all of those
TCP connections you get

1061
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:28,880
when you visit a website,

1062
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:31,700
add up to make your
internet seem really slow.

1063
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:32,980
So what ISPs have done

1064
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:34,830
is they started splitting these handshakes

1065
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:36,990
as a man in the middle
attacker, basically,

1066
00:39:36,990 --> 00:39:39,380
who benevolently
accelerates your connection,

1067
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:41,800
via what we call it,
performance enhancing proxy.

1068
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:42,633
The problem is that

1069
00:39:42,633 --> 00:39:45,700
if a customer uses end to
end encryption over VPN,

1070
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:47,170
these performance enhancing proxies

1071
00:39:47,170 --> 00:39:49,380
can't find those TCP
through the handshakes

1072
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:52,000
and so they can't
accelerate the connection.

1073
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,979
So in the short term,

1074
00:39:53,979 --> 00:39:56,310
you might have to accept that as reality.

1075
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:57,430
And just say, you know what,

1076
00:39:57,430 --> 00:39:58,890
passport numbers are sensitive enough

1077
00:39:58,890 --> 00:40:01,780
that we should send them
encrypted or not send them at all.

1078
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:02,810
And in many cases,

1079
00:40:02,810 --> 00:40:05,350
if you're using a TTP
layer encryption protocol

1080
00:40:05,350 --> 00:40:07,160
or a UDP encryption protocol,

1081
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:08,900
it doesn't affect performance at all.

1082
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:11,010
You should never be using
pop for your emails,

1083
00:40:11,010 --> 00:40:14,020
although we found thousands of
thousands of people still do,

1084
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:16,810
you should be using an
encrypted email client.

1085
00:40:16,810 --> 00:40:18,540
And since ISPs are already screwing around

1086
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:21,070
with TCP sequence
numbers and TCP sessions,

1087
00:40:21,070 --> 00:40:23,460
if they just change the
sequence numbers over the air,

1088
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:25,040
from what they are in the ground,

1089
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:26,760
they can prevent TCP hijacking attacks.

1090
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,770
A lot of ISPs seem to do this already,

1091
00:40:28,770 --> 00:40:31,200
although I think it's largely accidental.

1092
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:32,150
In the longer term, though,

1093
00:40:32,150 --> 00:40:33,460
we're trying to work on a solution

1094
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:36,070
that makes it easier
for individual customers

1095
00:40:36,070 --> 00:40:38,110
to be sure their data is always encrypted,

1096
00:40:38,110 --> 00:40:40,690
regardless of what protocol
mistakes they might make.

1097
00:40:40,690 --> 00:40:42,370
We're building a tool called QPEP

1098
00:40:42,370 --> 00:40:44,060
which uses the quick protocol,

1099
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:47,490
which is a TCP replacement
that is encrypted by default.

1100
00:40:47,490 --> 00:40:50,510
And it's a combination
between a tunneling VPN

1101
00:40:50,510 --> 00:40:52,343
and a performance enhancing proxy.

1102
00:40:53,310 --> 00:40:55,226
If you wanna take a look at QPEP,

1103
00:40:55,226 --> 00:40:58,040
there is a public GitHub
repository for it.

1104
00:40:58,040 --> 00:40:59,370
This isn't like a commercial product,

1105
00:40:59,370 --> 00:41:01,010
the goal is to build a tool

1106
00:41:01,010 --> 00:41:02,280
for people to start playing around

1107
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:04,080
with securing these networks.

1108
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:05,710
It's designed to be much more accessible

1109
00:41:05,710 --> 00:41:07,350
than existing PEPs,
which tend to be written

1110
00:41:07,350 --> 00:41:10,500
in these really obtuse C
libraries for networking.

1111
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:12,070
It's written in Python as a test bed

1112
00:41:12,070 --> 00:41:15,060
so you can simulate it without
a satellite equipment at all.

1113
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:16,810
And then most of the
networking layer is written

1114
00:41:16,810 --> 00:41:18,920
and go for performance reasons.

1115
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:19,870
And the end goal

1116
00:41:19,870 --> 00:41:22,460
is to help individuals
protect their traffic

1117
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:25,130
instead of trying to berate
ISPs into encrypting data,

1118
00:41:25,130 --> 00:41:26,260
which we know doesn't work

1119
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:28,373
because we've been doing it since 2005.

1120
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:33,796
So this shows the difference
between those two options

1121
00:41:33,796 --> 00:41:36,030
versus using a encrypted
proxy like the one

1122
00:41:36,030 --> 00:41:39,350
that we're building and using
a very good open source VPN

1123
00:41:39,350 --> 00:41:41,860
but one that doesn't take into
account the unique aspects

1124
00:41:41,860 --> 00:41:43,440
of satellite communications.

1125
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:44,570
And you can see the difference

1126
00:41:44,570 --> 00:41:45,610
in the amount of time it takes

1127
00:41:45,610 --> 00:41:47,880
to load just a very typical webpage

1128
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:48,713
as an indicator

1129
00:41:48,713 --> 00:41:51,013
of why customers aren't
encrypting their data.

1130
00:41:51,013 --> 00:41:53,580
It's not that they don't
know privacy is at risk.

1131
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:55,320
Many of the people the
response we're to disclosed to

1132
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:57,420
were like, "This isn't a
security vulnerability,

1133
00:41:57,420 --> 00:41:59,040
because everyone knows about it,"

1134
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:01,030
which has its own problems.

1135
00:42:01,030 --> 00:42:03,690
But I think fundamentally
when you give someone a choice

1136
00:42:03,690 --> 00:42:05,640
between performance and privacy,

1137
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:08,690
it's very likely that they
will choose performance,

1138
00:42:08,690 --> 00:42:10,500
especially in an
environment like satellite,

1139
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:13,730
where you already have
sluggish connections.

1140
00:42:13,730 --> 00:42:15,800
And so finding technological solutions

1141
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:18,340
that enable people to have
as good of a performance

1142
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:19,680
as they've come to expect

1143
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:20,870
while adding in privacy,

1144
00:42:20,870 --> 00:42:23,040
basically invisible in the background,

1145
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:26,610
is I think the best way
that we can bolster privacy

1146
00:42:26,610 --> 00:42:29,610
and security in these networks
for real satellite customers.

1147
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:32,500
So to sum things up,

1148
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:35,360
today, I've presented the
case that satellite broadband,

1149
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:37,100
as it's used in the status quo,

1150
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:39,560
is vulnerable to long range
eavesdropping attacks.

1151
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:41,110
Someone in a different country

1152
00:42:41,110 --> 00:42:42,840
or on a different continent from you

1153
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:45,360
can be listening to your
internet communications.

1154
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:48,210
And yet many people act
like this isn't the case.

1155
00:42:48,210 --> 00:42:50,660
Whether it's a massive fortune 500 company

1156
00:42:50,660 --> 00:42:53,180
or a random person in a
coffee shop somewhere,

1157
00:42:53,180 --> 00:42:55,190
people are leaking
deeply sensitive traffic

1158
00:42:55,190 --> 00:42:57,290
over satellite feeds as if they don't know

1159
00:42:57,290 --> 00:42:59,280
that an eavesdropper could be listening.

1160
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:00,690
We think this can be changed.

1161
00:43:00,690 --> 00:43:03,740
We think the underlying reason
that this is still a problem

1162
00:43:03,740 --> 00:43:05,750
is that performance encryption

1163
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:07,680
is something that ISPs have to build

1164
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:09,020
into their satellite networks

1165
00:43:09,020 --> 00:43:09,853
instead of something

1166
00:43:09,853 --> 00:43:11,840
that individuals can
just run for themselves

1167
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:13,590
when they connect to a satellite terminal.

1168
00:43:13,590 --> 00:43:15,530
And we think that we can
balance out that trade off

1169
00:43:15,530 --> 00:43:17,350
and bring security to customers

1170
00:43:17,350 --> 00:43:18,610
regardless of how they interface

1171
00:43:18,610 --> 00:43:20,560
with their satellite connection.

1172
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:22,930
So if I wanted to give a broader lesson,

1173
00:43:22,930 --> 00:43:24,770
a major takeaway from this talk

1174
00:43:24,770 --> 00:43:27,530
that has almost nothing
to do with satellites,

1175
00:43:27,530 --> 00:43:28,860
it would be very simple.

1176
00:43:28,860 --> 00:43:31,670
And that is that the Next Hop is unknown.

1177
00:43:31,670 --> 00:43:33,050
When you connect to the internet,

1178
00:43:33,050 --> 00:43:35,850
there's a whole web of
different nodes and connections

1179
00:43:35,850 --> 00:43:38,810
that's constantly changing,
that's routing your traffic.

1180
00:43:38,810 --> 00:43:41,450
And any one of those nodes
could be a satellite link

1181
00:43:41,450 --> 00:43:45,603
or a wireless tower or a
wire tapped ethernet cable.

1182
00:43:46,610 --> 00:43:48,600
And so if we wanna be sure

1183
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:50,160
that no one is listening to our traffic,

1184
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:51,880
wherever it might go next,

1185
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:53,570
'cause we could connect to a wifi hotspot

1186
00:43:53,570 --> 00:43:55,930
and it could have the best
encryption in the world,

1187
00:43:55,930 --> 00:43:57,740
but if the Next Hop is a satellite link,

1188
00:43:57,740 --> 00:43:59,370
that does us no good.

1189
00:43:59,370 --> 00:44:02,250
So having the ability to
encrypt your own traffic,

1190
00:44:02,250 --> 00:44:03,747
having the right to
encrypt your own traffic

1191
00:44:03,747 --> 00:44:06,380
and having the knowledge
to make that encryption

1192
00:44:06,380 --> 00:44:08,520
as secure and robust as possible,

1193
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:11,880
is I think critical to preventing
this whole class of attack

1194
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:14,540
regardless of the domain
we consider it in.

1195
00:44:14,540 --> 00:44:17,130
Thank you so much for
listening to my presentation.

1196
00:44:17,130 --> 00:44:20,270
I'm happy to answer
any questions via email

1197
00:44:20,270 --> 00:44:22,280
or in a breakout session after this.

1198
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:23,880
And I hope you enjoyed the talk.
