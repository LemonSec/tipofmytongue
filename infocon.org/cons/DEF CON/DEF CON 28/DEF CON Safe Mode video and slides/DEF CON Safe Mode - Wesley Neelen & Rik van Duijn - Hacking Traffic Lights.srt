1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:02,130
- Hi, welcome everybody.

2
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:05,180
We would like to talk today
about a research project

3
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:07,720
we did, hacking traffic lights,

4
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:10,720
and we would like to, to
share our findings and well,

5
00:00:11,885 --> 00:00:15,090
the things we found in our research.

6
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:16,490
First of all who are we?

7
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:17,660
My name is Wesley Neelen

8
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:20,390
and my colleague's name is Rik Van Duijn

9
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:23,620
and we both have been mainly
pen testing in the past year

10
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:25,493
for about seven, eight years.

11
00:00:27,023 --> 00:00:29,470
And of course, we also
have our own interests,

12
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:31,343
for example, I like to play
around with internet of things

13
00:00:31,343 --> 00:00:34,210
and the security of it
and innovations like that

14
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:39,210
and Rik likes to play with
malware and the investigate that.

15
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:41,930
I would like to at least one disclaimer,

16
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:43,840
we are no smarter traffic experts,

17
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,780
we're just, two guys that are interested

18
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:48,660
in this kind of innovations.

19
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:52,030
We decided to use it
to do a research on it.

20
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:55,030
We do use bicycles because we're Dutch,

21
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:58,060
but that doesn't really
help us in our investigation

22
00:00:58,060 --> 00:00:59,173
in our research.

23
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:03,853
Well, a small introduction.

24
00:01:04,770 --> 00:01:07,890
What we've seen that there
they're creating a platform,

25
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:09,700
multiple vendors are creating a platform

26
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:12,660
to exchange information
between traffic information.

27
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:17,660
For example, roadsigns can
repudiate States on a network,

28
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:21,010
the parking spots, how
many are still available,

29
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:23,430
and how many are occupied.

30
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:25,640
Audit traffic data, for example,

31
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:27,790
is there a traffic jam
and stuff like that.

32
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:31,090
But they are even trying to
connect the traffic lights,

33
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:34,210
the actual traffic light
systems to the same network.

34
00:01:34,210 --> 00:01:37,620
So it can act on the beat,

35
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:40,660
the messages that are sent on the network.

36
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:41,920
And one of the examples

37
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,970
is that they actually want
to connect the road users

38
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:46,140
to the networks as well.

39
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:49,400
For example, cyclists, cars, trucks,

40
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:52,653
and even the rescue vehicles,
their emergency vehicles.

41
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,870
Well, I have to mention
that in this research

42
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:58,430
we mainly have been
focusing on the cyclist,

43
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:02,590
and the reason for this is
that there was an app available

44
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:05,230
that allows you as a
cyclist to install it.

45
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:09,790
And if you're cycling on a
road, you will get the time

46
00:02:09,790 --> 00:02:13,853
to green will be decreased
or maybe even instant green.

47
00:02:15,003 --> 00:02:17,423
Because it was available,
we focused on that.

48
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,710
Important factor is
that in the Netherlands,

49
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:23,750
there are a lot of bicycles, 23 million,

50
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:25,410
and we have a lot of
cycling infrastructure

51
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:28,900
so well imagine that
on every intersection,

52
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:32,070
there is almost a cycling a traffic light

53
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:34,603
so it's quite important in our country.

54
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:41,830
Like Sal, we see multiple
apps being released,

55
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:44,690
so we are mainly interested

56
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:46,340
in the fact that we are able to talk

57
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:47,690
to traffic lights somehow.

58
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:48,950
And for example,

59
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:50,460
how are we able to talk to them?

60
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:52,920
And what if we are able to manipulate it,

61
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:55,273
what is possible and
what can we manipulate?

62
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:58,200
That was pretty interesting

63
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:01,253
and the reason we started the research.

64
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:04,870
One of the things we see in Netherlands

65
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:06,683
there's an ongoing partnership,

66
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:10,070
and the goal of that partnership,

67
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:11,610
three lights there's more traffic,

68
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:13,670
and the goal is to improve the safety,

69
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:15,143
comfort and traffic flow.

70
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:19,410
A lot of things are
happening in its partnership,

71
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:21,990
but some of the things are, for example,

72
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:24,920
a cyclist app that I was talking about,

73
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:28,210
they're trying to giving
the user the ability

74
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:30,430
to install an application on its phone.

75
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:32,840
And when he's cycling on an intersection,

76
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:36,760
the cyclist lies, time will
be decreased to go to green,

77
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:38,690
or maybe even instantly go to green

78
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:41,940
if there's no other traffic
at the intersection.

79
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:44,240
But another thing is,
for example, for trucks,

80
00:03:45,561 --> 00:03:48,890
they're trying to realize a green flow

81
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:52,760
on multiple traffic lights,
the trucks have to stop less,

82
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:55,598
which is of course a great idea.

83
00:03:55,598 --> 00:03:56,793
And emergency vehicle,

84
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:02,030
that's maybe even the most interesting one

85
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:05,130
because those will get instantly green,

86
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:07,910
if they will be passing a
connected traffic light,

87
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:12,530
but also other users the
road users will be notified,

88
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:15,570
that there is a vehicle coming,

89
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:16,970
coming up emergency vehicle.

90
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:24,130
Important thing within
the partnership is VRIs.

91
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:27,970
VRIs are the systems that are
actually at an intersection

92
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:32,970
that are actually, controlling
the actual traffic lights

93
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:37,760
and they are replacing the old
system for intelligent ones.

94
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:40,130
So that it is compatible with the network

95
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:42,440
and it is possible to communicate with,

96
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:44,700
but also that it is able to
send their own information

97
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:45,990
through the network.

98
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:50,890
And what we've seen that's
currently about 500 IVRIs

99
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:53,600
or VRI has been replaced for IVRIs

100
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:58,063
which is about 10% of
the total amount of VRIs.

101
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:02,530
And to give you an idea how
the things are connected

102
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:05,327
to each other, on the
right, you will see...

103
00:05:05,327 --> 00:05:06,660
You see the road users,

104
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:10,370
for example, cars, cyclists, or trucks.

105
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:12,610
And they are well
connected to the network,

106
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:15,770
for example, by using an
app like I said earlier,

107
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:18,610
but it's also possible that it
might be an onboard computer

108
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:20,300
within the truck for example.

109
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:24,400
And those systems are talking
to the well to cloud services,

110
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:28,343
which are also like the apps
created by multiple vendors,

111
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:32,710
and in the clouds, the
information that is sent

112
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:35,740
to the clouds can be
sent onto the network.

113
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:37,450
And for example, to traffic lights.

114
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:39,470
And one of the important things

115
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:43,180
in there is that mostly this
is done by using Camo PX,

116
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:48,050
which is a standard that
allows you to communicate

117
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:50,980
with each other within
that traffic light network

118
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:52,130
or traffic network.

119
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:54,670
And Rik will be explaining more on that.

120
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:56,120
- Cool.

121
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:58,230
Where we initially looked the first app,

122
00:05:58,230 --> 00:06:00,770
that allowed users to get the green light,

123
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:04,370
we saw a lots of
references to CAM objects,

124
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:07,070
and we saw that the app
was building CAM objects

125
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:09,170
with the position and
stuff like that in it.

126
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:11,610
And for us, it was
unclear what those were.

127
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:12,920
We started googling,

128
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:15,980
and we figured out that
it's actually a part

129
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:18,770
of the intelligent
transport system standard,

130
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:20,150
which is a European standard.

131
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:21,990
There's a different one as far as we know,

132
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:23,760
there's a different one in the U S

133
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:26,553
and there might even be a
different one in your country.

134
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:30,007
Important part of this standards

135
00:06:30,007 --> 00:06:32,610
are the cooperative awareness messages.

136
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:35,790
CAMO, CAM messages in the U S

137
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:38,380
they're called basic safety messages.

138
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:40,990
These contain all kinds of information

139
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:43,940
about the Intelligent Transport System,

140
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:48,653
it could be a car telling you
it's a speed stuff like that.

141
00:06:50,185 --> 00:06:54,400
When we looked into the objects itself,

142
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:58,880
we noticed that they contain
lots of different information,

143
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:03,160
we can see the position,
what type of vehicle you are,

144
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:05,050
important to note.

145
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:09,440
We later we can see why you
shouldn't use the station

146
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:13,183
type to determine what a
user is and what they can do,

147
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,780
but there is also a different container,

148
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:18,150
there's a high frequency container,

149
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:20,213
which contains data that changes often.

150
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:26,060
Stuff like data, the direction,
information like that,

151
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:28,680
and there's a low frequency container

152
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:33,640
containing having data that's more static

153
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,250
such as if my lights are on or off,

154
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:39,003
or, and this was my
history, my path history.

155
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:41,850
But more importantly,

156
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:45,880
we came across a special
vehicle container.

157
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:49,810
And this new container
contains information

158
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:51,454
such as I'm...

159
00:07:51,454 --> 00:07:53,870
I'm transporting dangerous goods,

160
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:56,100
or I am in emergency vehicle

161
00:07:56,100 --> 00:08:01,023
and I need to have a green
lights right now stuff like that.

162
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:04,180
This for us was the point
where we were like, okay,

163
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:05,370
can we manipulate this?

164
00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:08,140
And can we send this to
the traffic lights that are

165
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:10,403
connected to our apps?

166
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:15,080
When we started looking into
this, we actually figured out

167
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:17,560
that the intelligent
transport system standard,

168
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:20,790
already has a security standard in it.

169
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:23,410
It's based on public infrastructure,

170
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:26,750
where a very simplified the...

171
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:29,920
Your vehicle receives a certificate,

172
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:33,200
the certificate contains
information about your vehicle

173
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,830
and well not necessarily your identity,

174
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:39,250
but that you are a vehicle and
what you are allowed to do.

175
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:42,380
Which allows other systems on the road

176
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:46,163
to actually validate what
you are sending to them.

177
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:53,060
Part of the CAM messages
and the certificate

178
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:56,160
are the SSP and ITSA ID.

179
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,899
The ITSA ID,

180
00:08:57,899 --> 00:09:00,820
is the Intelligence Transport
System Application ID,

181
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:03,010
and it describes some base permission

182
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:07,340
such as you are allowed
to send CAM messages.

183
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:10,090
And there's a service specific permission,

184
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:14,040
that's also in there that
allows you to actually say,

185
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,470
I'm allowed to do this.

186
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:17,360
For example, I'm in emergency vehicle

187
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,690
and I'm allowed to tell the world

188
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:21,513
that I need green lights right now.

189
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:26,960
Every message you send out, you sign,

190
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,670
and it's combined with the certificate

191
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:31,940
in order to let other systems on the road,

192
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:36,457
identify that the message
you are sending them

193
00:09:36,457 --> 00:09:39,620
is actually valid you're
allowed to send it,

194
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:42,880
and that you actually have
the correct permissions

195
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:43,853
to request this.

196
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:47,840
When we were preparing this presentation,

197
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,530
we actually came across
some interesting work

198
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:51,690
already that's being done on this,

199
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:54,390
there's a cool paper by Joseph Kamel

200
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:58,210
which goes onto assume

201
00:09:58,210 --> 00:10:00,570
let's say our authentication authorization

202
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:02,273
is already correct,

203
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:04,143
What is it?

204
00:10:04,143 --> 00:10:06,950
What can we do with a valid car?

205
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:08,460
Can I say to others,

206
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:11,540
I'm putting on the
emergency brakes right now,

207
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:14,240
will other cars immediately start braking?

208
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,220
There's really interesting
research being done.

209
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:19,100
There's also some cool
software being released

210
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:23,283
in order to look for abuse
on the network already,

211
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:27,900
the security for this exists.

212
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:31,150
However, when we started
looking into the apps

213
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:34,330
that obviously we'll talk about soon,

214
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:37,993
we noticed that there's
still some work to be done.

215
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:41,580
- Yeah, like earlier mentioned,

216
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:45,240
we saw multiple well Android applications

217
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:48,410
that a cyclist could install on his phone

218
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:51,490
and if he installed it
and he's going to...

219
00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:54,450
He's approaching an
intersection, he will get green,

220
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:56,290
the time will be decreased to green,

221
00:10:56,290 --> 00:10:58,383
or he would instantly get green.

222
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:02,370
When we started, we were
like, okay, what's going on?

223
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:03,440
How does this app work?

224
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,140
And what is it exactly doing?

225
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:09,140
And what we did, we
Decompiled the applications,

226
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:14,070
and we saw that CAM PX
are being sent over MQTT.

227
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:15,300
And that was pretty interesting

228
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:18,330
because if we are able to
create those CAM PX ourselves

229
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:19,470
and send it over MQTT,

230
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:22,170
for example, using Byton, well,

231
00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:24,023
we might be able to trick the system.

232
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:26,240
The thing was at that time,

233
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,193
we didn't know where the CAM
PX exactly were at that time.

234
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:33,290
We had quite a hard time
imitating the behavior

235
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:36,090
and well making it, doing
it in Byton the same.

236
00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:39,110
And also because the ASN
and the Protobuf and coding

237
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:40,903
that was done by the application.

238
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:45,750
Well during that time we
decided to take another approach

239
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:49,170
and let's use another tool,
which was called FRIDA,

240
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:52,307
and at that time it was
the first time we used it.

241
00:11:52,307 --> 00:11:53,770
And it's really an amazing tool,

242
00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:56,640
it allows you to look into an application,

243
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:59,140
for example, an existing
Android application,

244
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:01,060
that's running on an Android device.

245
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:01,910
And for example,

246
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:03,500
bring the information
that's in the function

247
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:07,733
or call out a functions and
do modifications for example.

248
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:13,800
After trying, we were able
to print out the CAM PX,

249
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:16,100
and on the right you could see the snippet

250
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:19,700
of that information, and
like Rik was talking about,

251
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:22,220
you see the basic container station type

252
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:24,000
and GPS coordinates.

253
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,870
We were like this pretty interesting,

254
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:28,140
what and how the system will react

255
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:30,623
if we are going to
manipulate this information.

256
00:12:32,844 --> 00:12:33,750
In order to do so,

257
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:37,610
we also use data and we
were able to write a script

258
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:39,830
that's on the left and what it is doing,

259
00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:41,500
it's again, just hooking

260
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:44,960
before the publish karma
function is being called.

261
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:47,550
The CAM PX is published on MQTT

262
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:49,750
just before that we modified information.

263
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:53,000
For example, the speed,
the GPS coordinates

264
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,780
and information like that.

265
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:57,770
And our goal was to imitate the behavior

266
00:12:57,770 --> 00:12:59,543
that you see in right in the image,

267
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:02,960
to let the system believe
that there is a cyclist

268
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:05,150
cycling on the intersection all the time,

269
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:06,730
and add in the loop.

270
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:08,133
The thing was at that time,

271
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:12,040
we weren't just recognized as one cyclist.

272
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:14,573
And that was well, we wanted to bypass it,

273
00:13:14,573 --> 00:13:18,540
we want it to be continuously
while a loop of cyclists

274
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:20,713
that are passing the intersection.

275
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:24,100
So we are trying to bypass that

276
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:28,200
and the way to bypass it was quite simple,

277
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,910
because we found out
that just before the...

278
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:33,470
If we just, before the
CAM has been published,

279
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:35,910
disconnect and connect
on the MQTT channel,

280
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:39,330
we are recognized as a
different and a new cyclist.

281
00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:41,270
By just disconnecting and connecting,

282
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:44,510
we are able to just before
every CAM Pics was being sent,

283
00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:48,130
we are able to act like
we are different cyclists

284
00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:48,963
instead of one.

285
00:13:48,963 --> 00:13:50,480
That was cool.

286
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:54,113
We were able to, get
that flow continuously.

287
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:57,930
Later on we found another
similar application,

288
00:13:57,930 --> 00:13:59,220
which is also an application,

289
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:01,670
and if you install it as a cyclist,

290
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:04,700
you will get the time will be decreased,

291
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:06,390
or you will instant get a green,

292
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:09,060
depending on the situation
at the intersection.

293
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:11,310
But this application was even easier

294
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:13,780
because it was just
sending one post request.

295
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:17,610
As you can see in the slide
with similar information

296
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:22,262
that we saw in previous app,
like speed, GPS coordinates,

297
00:14:22,262 --> 00:14:25,890
and then information like
that, also the station type,

298
00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:27,943
and that was being sent to the server.

299
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:32,690
Somehow this is probably
converted for example,

300
00:14:32,690 --> 00:14:34,163
to CAM by the backend.

301
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:37,250
We didn't have to take
care of that at all,

302
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:38,690
we just have to send one post

303
00:14:38,690 --> 00:14:40,530
and the dishes will react on it.

304
00:14:40,530 --> 00:14:43,480
And the interesting thing,
there was no authentication,

305
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:46,810
so there is no way to distinguish
a cyclist from each other

306
00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:47,870
within the system.

307
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:51,450
And as it was quite an interesting Burp,

308
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:52,563
because maybe we can,

309
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:56,643
fake a lot of cyclists
in the city, for example.

310
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:00,100
We wrote a pilot script
to just send this post

311
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:02,090
with the correct information.

312
00:15:02,090 --> 00:15:05,280
And well, we recorded the demo on it,

313
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,640
and I would like to show the demo.

314
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:11,160
Here you will see a video,
where we are at a traffic light

315
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:14,430
at a connected traffic
light on an intersection,

316
00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:15,800
and in this video,

317
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,427
there is other traffic
at the intersection,

318
00:15:17,427 --> 00:15:20,400
now you will see that the
system reacts and waiting sign

319
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:25,310
turns on, but it will wait
until it goes to green,

320
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:26,270
when it's safe.

321
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:28,930
That's quite important to note,

322
00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:30,820
the safety system stays intact,

323
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:34,483
it will never turn two lights
at green at the same time.

324
00:15:35,342 --> 00:15:39,423
That's luckily and good that,
that's still in the place.

325
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:44,210
Also, we recorded a second
video also at a traffic light,

326
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:46,460
but in this case without
any other traffic,

327
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:49,410
and as you can see, while
it reacts quiet quickly,

328
00:15:49,410 --> 00:15:52,720
and instantly, if we send one post request

329
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,993
the system instantly turns to green.

330
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:58,823
So this goes quiet quickly.

331
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:02,790
What could we do with this vulnerability?

332
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:06,910
Its abuse of functionality
but, like we mentioned,

333
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:09,360
it is not able to see multiple cyclists

334
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:14,360
it's just using every request
and doing an action on that.

335
00:16:14,363 --> 00:16:16,980
What we could do is
use the previous script

336
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:21,010
and do it on a lot of traffic
lights at the same time,

337
00:16:21,010 --> 00:16:25,543
because that system was
running in 10 cities currently.

338
00:16:26,502 --> 00:16:30,080
And you could just interrupt the traffic

339
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:32,730
in a complete city at a time.

340
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:37,730
- So in conclusion, I think as we are,

341
00:16:38,410 --> 00:16:42,660
the place we are now
is that there's no real

342
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:45,730
use of the security part of the standard.

343
00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:47,080
They are using corporate,

344
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:49,060
cooperative awareness messages

345
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:50,590
to determine where vehicles are.

346
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:54,440
But there's no clear
distinction on what they are,

347
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:56,943
who you are, or if you
even authorize to do so.

348
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:00,660
Luckily now we're working
with the public data

349
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:02,730
where cyclists are being...

350
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:07,600
being used, but there
are some closed data's

351
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:12,090
going on for trucks,
for emergency vehicles.

352
00:17:12,090 --> 00:17:14,000
And especially those would,

353
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:19,000
could pose a real threat for traffic.

354
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:22,920
Luckily security systems will stay intact.

355
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,810
So there's no like hacker style,

356
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:27,810
all the lights green at same
time, cars hitting each other,

357
00:17:27,810 --> 00:17:32,810
stuff like that, just currently
were able to annoy you,

358
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:35,423
which is already fun.

359
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:40,480
The reason we are giving this presentation

360
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:45,380
is we really believe that this
is something that's coming

361
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:47,730
and we need to be sure that
this is actually working

362
00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:49,930
properly, meaning that authentication,

363
00:17:49,930 --> 00:17:52,770
authorization are correctly implemented.

364
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:56,200
We've seen it with e-mail,
we're still having issues

365
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:59,280
determining if a mail
you've received is actually

366
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,150
for the person you received it from.

367
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:03,420
And it's really important

368
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:05,360
that the moment our physical lives,

369
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,960
traffic is being
controlled by these systems

370
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:11,543
that this is something that's
actually properly working.

371
00:18:14,848 --> 00:18:16,877
We would recommend that...

372
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:21,010
these apps will start to use
some form of authentication,

373
00:18:21,010 --> 00:18:25,500
at least knowing that there's
one person operating one app.

374
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:28,240
If they choose the spoof,
whatever it is they do,

375
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,943
at least we would know,

376
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:35,023
they would only be able to
control one digital cyclist.

377
00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:40,010
And it's becoming more and more
important to detect monetary

378
00:18:40,010 --> 00:18:41,600
abuse on the backend of things,

379
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:45,480
meaning that the central system
receiving all these messages

380
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:48,520
and distributing them to
the different traffic lights

381
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:53,520
would need to look for unexpected
or implausible behavior

382
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:56,283
and block users accordingly.

383
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:59,440
Which would reduce the impact

384
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,110
of somebody trying to manipulate this,

385
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:03,640
and after that we need,

386
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:05,770
if the moment we have the authentication

387
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:08,950
or authorization of the
control, we will have to see,

388
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:12,633
and look into abuse from a allowed user,

389
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:14,780
but that's the next step.

390
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:18,983
This is much as our
presentation encompasses,

391
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:24,300
if you have any questions and
you want to join the Q and A,

392
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:27,720
it will be on the 6th
of August between 1:30

393
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:31,410
and two o'clock, or if you
need to contact us directly,

394
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:33,460
check it out on Twitter.

395
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:34,293
