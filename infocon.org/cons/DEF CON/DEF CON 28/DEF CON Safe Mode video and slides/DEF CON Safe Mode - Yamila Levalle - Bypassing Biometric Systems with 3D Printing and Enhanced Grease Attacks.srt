00:00:01,130 --> 00:00:03,170
- Hi, my name is Yamila.

2
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:06,270
I'm a security researcher
at Dreamlab Technologies,

3
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:08,600
and also 3D printing enthusiast.

4
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:11,020
And today, we're gonna talk about,

5
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:14,790
bypassing biometric systems,
with or without the help

6
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:16,513
of 3D printing technologies.

7
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:24,400
Humans have used features
such as face, voice and gait

8
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,390
for thousand of years,
to recognize each other.

9
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:28,960
But only recently,

10
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,059
humans have started using
biometric-based systems

11
00:00:32,059 --> 00:00:33,459
to authenticate individuals.

12
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:38,230
Biometrics is the science of establishing

13
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:42,030
or determining an identity,
based on the physical

14
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:44,680
or behavioral traits of an individual,

15
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:49,680
such as the one as we can
see here in the slide.

16
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:55,230
Fingerprint, DNA, signature,
iris, face, voice, gait,

17
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:59,283
vein pattern, ear shape,
keystroke dynamics, and more.

18
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:05,980
Biometric systems are essentially,

19
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:07,800
pattern recognition systems

20
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:10,270
that read as input biometric data,

21
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:13,690
extract the feature set from such data,

22
00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:17,090
and finally, compare
it with a template set

23
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:19,374
as stored in a database.

24
00:01:19,374 --> 00:01:24,090
If the selected feature set
from the given input is closed

25
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:27,250
to a template set a store in the database,

26
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:30,147
then the user is granted access.

27
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:38,253
But biometric systems are
prone to different attacks.

28
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:43,220
Direct attacks presentation
or spoofing attacks

29
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:45,313
are performed at the sensor level.

30
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:49,913
The sensor is fooled and and
not replaced nor tampered.

31
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:51,900
And direct attacks

32
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:55,280
are performed inside the biometric system.

33
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:59,610
For example, by passing or
overriding the capture device,

34
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:02,370
the signal processor, the comparator,

35
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:04,060
or the decision engine,

36
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:08,143
manipulating the data in their
biometric reference database

37
00:02:08,143 --> 00:02:12,360
or exploiting possibly weak points

38
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,000
in the communication channels

39
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,380
between the different components.

40
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:18,000
But during this talk,

41
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,140
we are going to focus on this,

42
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:25,520
on presentation attacks,

43
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,733
this part of the system.

44
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:36,073
Now, we are going to see
presentation attacks in reality.

45
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:41,910
These are real cases of
criminals using silicon masks

46
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:43,720
to fool security cameras,

47
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:47,200
airport security and
facial recognition systems.

48
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,770
The first one is a suspect in the robbery

49
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:52,223
of a North Carolina bank.

50
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:58,470
This one robbed four
banks and a CVS Pharmacy

51
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:01,300
with the silicon mask from online site.

52
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:04,280
I think the model of the
mask name is the player

53
00:03:05,603 --> 00:03:09,436
from SPFX Mask is a site
that's now is closed,

54
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:17,300
but it used to sell these
type of realistics masks.

55
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:23,080
The third one is a
suspect accused of robbery

56
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,010
and several other crimes,

57
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:30,000
committed using a generic mask
made by another online site.

58
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,991
The name of this model,

59
00:03:31,991 --> 00:03:34,723
of this mask model is the neighbor.

60
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:38,210
And the last one is a passenger

61
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:40,020
who boarded the plane in Hong Kong

62
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:42,550
as an old man in flat cap,

63
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:45,817
but arrived in Canada as a young man.

64
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:53,790
Regarding fingerprint biometric systems,

65
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:57,210
this first case is a Brazilian doctor,

66
00:03:57,210 --> 00:03:59,899
who faced charges of fraud

67
00:03:59,899 --> 00:04:04,410
after being caught on camera
using silicone fingers

68
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:07,223
to signing for work for absent colleagues.

69
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:11,510
The second case, is a gang involved

70
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:14,520
in the illegal preparation,

71
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,726
this is the image.

72
00:04:15,726 --> 00:04:16,559
(chuckling loudly)

73
00:04:16,559 --> 00:04:20,550
The legal preparation and
selling of clone fingerprints,

74
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:23,000
to fool biometric attendance systems

75
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,423
of several educational institutions.

76
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:30,670
The last case was in
my country, Argentina.

77
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:33,920
Six employees of the
local airline were fired.

78
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:36,692
After discovering that they falsify

79
00:04:36,692 --> 00:04:40,320
their entry to work with silicone fingers,

80
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,870
taking turns to attend, but on weekends

81
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:47,920
when the payment is double,
all six attended to work.

82
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:56,483
But how 3D printing could
help bypass biometric systems.

83
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:59,100
In this first case,

84
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:01,240
researchers from Forbes,

85
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,970
full Android facial recognition systems

86
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:05,423
with a 3D printed head.

87
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:09,950
In the second case,

88
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:13,680
the MSU, Michigan State University team,

89
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:18,363
created a fake finger by
printing by 3D printing a mold.

90
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,170
In this last case,

91
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:26,180
a group of researchers from Bkav,

92
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:27,950
demonstrated that it was possible

93
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:31,910
to bypass the face
recognition logging mechanism

94
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:36,480
of the iPhone X using a
cheap 3D printed mask made

95
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,623
from a stone powder.

96
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:43,300
I love 3D printing.

97
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:45,640
I have two 3D printers at home.

98
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,950
Why not make my own experiments

99
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:50,210
for bypassing biometric systems?

100
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:52,438
But first, I wanted to try

101
00:05:52,438 --> 00:05:56,020
the traditional methods for
attacking biometric systems

102
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:59,580
to better understand how
3D printing technology

103
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:02,853
will help make these
attacks faster and better.

104
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:08,100
But first, we need to know

105
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:11,793
how is the fingerprint
recognition process.

106
00:06:12,982 --> 00:06:17,490
Most fingerprint scanners
compare distinctive features

107
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:21,283
of the fingerprint,
generally known as minutiae.

108
00:06:22,359 --> 00:06:26,100
Typically, investigators
concentrate on points

109
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:28,710
where ridge lines end,

110
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:33,137
or where one ridge splits
into two call bifurcations.

111
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:38,590
Collectively, these another
distinctive features

112
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:41,390
such as you can see here,

113
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:44,653
delta, a short ridge, a spur,

114
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:49,600
the bifurcation, ridge enclosure,

115
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:52,603
a crossover or ridge, an island.

116
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:58,743
All these features
together are called typica.

117
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:05,860
The scanner use complex algorithms

118
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:10,100
to recognize and analyze
these distinctive features.

119
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:14,280
The basic idea is to measure
the relative positions

120
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:17,230
of the features in the same sort of way,

121
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:19,740
you might recognize a part of the sky

122
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:23,383
by the relative position of the stars.

123
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:26,550
But to gather much,

124
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:31,180
the scanner doesn't have
to find the entire pattern

125
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:32,530
of distinctive features,

126
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:34,180
both in the sample

127
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:38,630
and in the print from
the biometric database.

128
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:42,440
It simply has to find a
sufficient number of features

129
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:45,807
and patterns that the two
prints have in common.

130
00:07:49,875 --> 00:07:53,590
There are many fingerprint
sensors on the market.

131
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:56,300
These are optical sensors,

132
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:59,610
you can recognize them for the light

133
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:01,463
in general, they use light.

134
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,760
These are capacitive sensors,

135
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:07,393
and the last one is an ultrasonic sensors.

136
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:14,340
Optical fingerprint sensors

137
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:16,780
are the oldest method of capturing

138
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:19,040
and comparing fingerprints.

139
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:23,230
This technique relies on
capturing an optical image

140
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:24,530
and using algorithms

141
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:27,880
to detect unique patterns on the surface

142
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:32,743
by analyzing the lightest and
darkest areas of the image.

143
00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:40,390
Capacitive fingerprint scanners,

144
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:44,623
instead of creating a traditional
image of a fingerprint,

145
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:49,350
they use the body natural capacitance

146
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:50,773
to read the fingerprints.

147
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:54,200
Because the charge stored in the capacitor

148
00:08:55,587 --> 00:09:00,587
will be changed slightly
when a finger ridge, here,

149
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,520
is placed over the conductive plate,

150
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,980
while an air gap or a finger valley

151
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:10,673
will leave the charge of the
capacitor relatively unchanged.

152
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:15,440
These changes can then
be recorded and analyzed

153
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:19,923
to look for distinctive and
unique fingerprint attributes.

154
00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:25,550
The latest fingerprint scanning technology

155
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:27,810
is the ultrasonic sensor.

156
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:30,370
To capture the details of a fingerprint,

157
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:34,397
the hardware consists on both
an ultrasonic transmitter

158
00:09:34,397 --> 00:09:35,323
and a receiver.

159
00:09:36,528 --> 00:09:40,070
An ultrasonic pulse is
transmitted against the finger

160
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:42,720
that displays over the scanner.

161
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,220
Some of this pulse is absorbed,

162
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:48,390
and some of it is bounced
back to the sensor,

163
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:52,033
depending upon the unique
details of each fingerprint.

164
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:56,110
The sensor then calculates the intensity

165
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:59,920
of the returning ultrasonic
pulse at different points,

166
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:03,480
resulting in a very detailed reproduction

167
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,933
of the scanned fingerprint.

168
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:13,093
Now for our test, the device
to be tested are four,

169
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:19,053
two biometric attendance
systems with optical sensors

170
00:10:21,647 --> 00:10:25,950
and to mobile phones, one
with a capacitive sensor

171
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:28,183
and the other one with
an ultrasonic sensor.

172
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:37,680
This is the first photo of the materials,

173
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:41,313
both for experiments and
includes a lot of materials.

174
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:45,930
Alginate, a hot glue gun,
gelatin powder, gummy bears,

175
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:49,860
candle wax, transparent
tape, playdoh, instant glue,

176
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:53,500
epoxy putty, UV Resin, silicon fingertips,

177
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,493
fingerprint ink, and more.

178
00:10:56,410 --> 00:10:58,300
But during the test,

179
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:01,500
I realized that I missed
important materials,

180
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,490
like for example, silicone,

181
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:06,510
liquid latex, wood glue, and so much more,

182
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:08,653
and the list grew and grew a lot.

183
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:16,063
The first attack to this
was the grease attack.

184
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:21,180
For grease attacks, you need
to have a clear grease stain

185
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:24,493
left on the surface of
the fingerprint scanner.

186
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:30,040
But this stain must have most
of the important features

187
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:32,500
of the fingerprint left on pad,

188
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:36,930
so that the scanner can
reliably read the same line ends

189
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:40,083
and curves that is detected
on the previous user.

190
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,564
The idea of the attack

191
00:11:42,564 --> 00:11:45,660
is to gently press different materials

192
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:49,120
such as gummy bears, playdoh
the silicone fingertips,

193
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:52,840
and latex gloves against
the fingerprint scanner.

194
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:57,840
But with care, with careful
without ruining the stain.

195
00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:07,053
Here are the results
of the grease attacks.

196
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:10,680
With gummy bears, playdoh, latex gloves

197
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,120
and silicone fingers,

198
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:14,090
the scanner detected the finger,

199
00:12:14,090 --> 00:12:18,770
but the fingerprint was not
clear enough to fool the sensor.

200
00:12:18,770 --> 00:12:22,513
So, this attack was unsuccessful
on all the tested devices.

201
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:26,980
But for me this test was not a failure

202
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:29,900
because the gummy bears were really yummy,

203
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:33,200
and kept me fed during the
rest of the experiments,

204
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,043
so no failure for me.

205
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:43,740
The problem with grease
attacks is that in most cases,

206
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:47,630
a regular grease stain
on the scanner surface

207
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:49,747
is not enough to fool the sensor.

208
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:53,940
We need to enhance it
with other substances

209
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:58,580
to obtain better results,
impersonating legitimate users,

210
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:02,930
but these substances must be transparent,

211
00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:06,950
so that the user does not notice them.

212
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:09,800
And also with ointment consistency

213
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:12,153
to better enhance the fingerprint stain.

214
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:16,720
This substance could be spread

215
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:19,280
in the legitimate user fingerprint

216
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:21,103
or in the fingerprint sensor,

217
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:26,253
using petrolatum ointment,

218
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:31,200
paraffin or cocoa butter lip balm,

219
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,330
we successfully fooled the sensors,

220
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:36,380
and we're able to authenticate ourselves

221
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:39,000
as the last user of the device

222
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,963
in optical and in capacitive scanners.

223
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:50,943
Now, we are going to see a demo.

224
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:57,020
In this case, we are using
cocoa butter lip balm.

225
00:13:57,530 --> 00:13:59,680
We are spreading the lip balm

226
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:02,133
in the legitimate user fingerprint.

227
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:07,390
We can see that uncanceled grease stain

228
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:09,033
in the fingerprint scanner.

229
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:14,410
And then another user
wearing a latex glove,

230
00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:18,600
can be authenticated as
the last legitimate user

231
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,543
of the device.

232
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:26,263
Now for consensual attacks,

233
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:31,630
that term consensual suggest that the user

234
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:36,410
we are taking the fingerprint
from, is aware of the process

235
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:40,440
and participates by
pressing his or her finger

236
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:42,163
into some kind of a mold.

237
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,550
For molds, we use these materials,

238
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:51,290
alginate, epoxy putty, playdoh,
hot glue and candle wax.

239
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:54,040
And for casting, we use silicone,

240
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:56,960
homemade ballistic gelatin, liquid latex,

241
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:59,500
synthetic resin and wood glue.

242
00:15:07,104 --> 00:15:09,021
You can see here, here,

243
00:15:10,890 --> 00:15:15,890
you can see here that the
hot glue mold, of course,

244
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:19,730
is the researcher's
fingerprint are blurred.

245
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:24,730
But in this part, you can
see that the hot glue mold

246
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:27,580
is really, it's very detail,

247
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:30,553
so it's really a good mold.

248
00:15:37,018 --> 00:15:40,390
For the molds, we obtain the best results

249
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:42,940
with alginate and hot glue.

250
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:45,960
And for casting, we
obtain the best results,

251
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:49,543
using liquid latex,
wood glue and silicone.

252
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:53,890
With the combination of a hot glue mold,

253
00:15:53,890 --> 00:15:57,250
and liquid latex or wood glue casting,

254
00:15:57,250 --> 00:16:00,280
we were able to fool all the sensors.

255
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:03,690
The same with the
combination of alginate mold

256
00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:05,373
and liquid latex casting.

257
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:12,870
You can see here that the
ballistic gelatin test,

258
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:14,290
didn't work.

259
00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:16,120
That's because ballistic gelatin

260
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:18,500
is not so easy to make at home.

261
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:21,710
We try several combinations
of gelatin powder,

262
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:23,530
water and glycerin,

263
00:16:23,530 --> 00:16:26,823
but the results were not
enough to fool the scanners.

264
00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:31,463
Also, note that the working
fingerprints are very thin.

265
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:37,670
And please be careful if you
plan to make hot glue molds.

266
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:40,060
Let the glue cool down a bit,

267
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:44,040
and test the temperature under the foil,

268
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:47,400
and dip your finger in
water because before,

269
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:50,890
sorry, before pressing
heat against the hot glue.

270
00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:55,890
Trust me the heated glue
can reach over 200 degrees.

271
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:59,453
I've been there and it
burns, and it burns a lot.

272
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:09,130
For unconsensual attacks, in this attacks,

273
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:12,700
the user does not participate actively,

274
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:15,060
and latent fingerprints are obtained

275
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:16,453
in non-cooperative way.

276
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:22,630
Assuming we have identified
the correct latent fingerprint,

277
00:17:23,331 --> 00:17:27,763
we need to follow the following procedure.

278
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:32,603
This procedures here.

279
00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:35,430
So, we are going to need

280
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:40,430
to enhance the latent
fingerprint with glue fumes,

281
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:45,120
or fingerprint powder.

282
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:48,610
Lift the latent fingerprint
with a digital camera

283
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:50,030
or transparent tape,

284
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:54,190
digitally enhance the
fingerprints with software,

285
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:58,620
create the mold and cast
artificial fingers with silicone,

286
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:00,560
liquid latex or wood glue.

287
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:05,345
The first option to enhance
the latent fingerprint

288
00:18:05,345 --> 00:18:10,345
is dusting with fingerprint
powder and a brush.

289
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:15,440
The second option is
encapsulating the latent print,

290
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:18,990
inside a container with instant glue.

291
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:22,230
Fumes from the glue will
be attached to the ridge

292
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:26,233
of the latent fingerprint,
make it impossible to lift it.

293
00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:37,250
In this case, we obtained
the best results,

294
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:40,870
lifting the latent fingerprints
with a digital camera,

295
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:45,640
using a fingerprint
enhancement software in Python,

296
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:49,720
to digitally enhance the fingerprint image

297
00:18:50,690 --> 00:18:53,530
offset printing a transparency,

298
00:18:53,530 --> 00:18:56,650
using the transparency as a mold,

299
00:18:56,650 --> 00:18:59,640
and casting it with liquid latex.

300
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,960
With this procedure,

301
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:04,223
we were able to fool the optical sensors.

302
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:09,050
The fingerprint ink on a
latex glove techniques,

303
00:19:09,050 --> 00:19:14,013
also worked on capacitive
and ultrasonic sensors.

304
00:19:15,050 --> 00:19:16,658
You can see here

305
00:19:16,658 --> 00:19:21,658
that the offset plate
technique didn't work.

306
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:28,600
But it did not work because
it, the offset plate,

307
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:31,820
was covered with some kind of rubber

308
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:35,690
that is generally used
in this type of plate,

309
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:39,320
and the rubber interfere with
the creation of the mold,

310
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:41,370
but without the rubber,

311
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:44,220
I think it's a technique that could work.

312
00:19:52,330 --> 00:19:55,540
For unconsensual attacks
which 3D printing,

313
00:19:55,540 --> 00:20:00,540
we need an UV Resin
SLA 3D printer software

314
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:04,773
to digitally enhanced
the latent fingerprint.

315
00:20:07,604 --> 00:20:11,483
A 3D CAD designed to like
for example Tinkercad,

316
00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:17,490
and a latent fingerprint in glass,

317
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:19,673
or a fingerprint ink in paper.

318
00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:26,370
In this case, we can use
FDM or filament 3D printers

319
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:27,930
for these attacks,

320
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:32,223
because we need the precision
of an UV Resin printer.

321
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:41,570
To obtain a working fingerprint
through 3D printing,

322
00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:44,150
we need to follow these steps.

323
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:47,090
First, we need to lift
the latent fingerprint

324
00:20:47,090 --> 00:20:50,620
with a digital camera,
with macro functionality.

325
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:54,350
Then, we need to use fingerprint
enhancement software.

326
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:58,470
In this case, I use a software in Python

327
00:20:58,470 --> 00:21:03,470
but you can use any kind of
graphics software for this task.

328
00:21:04,037 --> 00:21:08,380
Then we need to import the enhanced image

329
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:10,083
of the fingerprint into Tinkercad.

330
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:13,920
and configure the dimensions

331
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:18,540
and add the ridge height
to create the 3D model.

332
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:21,410
One negative or hollow for casting

333
00:21:21,410 --> 00:21:25,500
and one positive for direct tests.

334
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:29,940
Then we need to print the
models on the 3D printer

335
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:34,390
in this case is the
Anycubic Photon 3D printer

336
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:39,340
with UV Resin, and then we
need to use isopropyl alcohol

337
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:43,240
and UV-post curing lamp or direct sunlight

338
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:45,853
to complete the final curing process.

339
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,240
At the end, we need to cast the molds

340
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:53,920
with wood glue or liquid latex.

341
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:56,550
It took us 10 retries

342
00:21:56,550 --> 00:22:00,330
to achieve the optimal printer
settings and ridge height.

343
00:22:00,330 --> 00:22:05,330
But the most important
step of this procedure

344
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:08,093
is this one, is the step four,

345
00:22:09,410 --> 00:22:14,410
if the step four is okay,
they fake fingerprints

346
00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:19,680
will work in the different
sensors and scanners.

347
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:22,030
So it's really important

348
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:27,030
to configure the fingerprint length,

349
00:22:27,630 --> 00:22:32,123
height and the ridge
height in a correct way.

350
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:38,293
The results.

351
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:44,410
The fingerprint obtained from
the 3D mold with liquid latex

352
00:22:44,410 --> 00:22:48,733
or wood glue casting,
worked on all sensors,

353
00:22:49,650 --> 00:22:52,810
and the positive
fingerprint, print directly

354
00:22:52,810 --> 00:22:56,480
on UV Resin, worked on
the ultrasonic sensor

355
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:59,393
and in one of the optical sensors.

356
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:03,450
In the optical sensor,

357
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:07,290
we had to spray the fingerprint
with cocoa butter lip balm

358
00:23:07,290 --> 00:23:11,993
or petrolatum for the sensor
to recognize it as a finger.

359
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:18,560
And here you can see a
summary of all the process.

360
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:23,820
Here is the fingerprint enhancement,

361
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:25,990
the models in Tinkercad,

362
00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:30,280
the printed models and
the casting with wood glue

363
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:33,270
and liquid latex and then again,

364
00:23:33,270 --> 00:23:38,270
we are using the fake fingerprints

365
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:42,443
to authenticate in an optical scanner.

366
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:47,823
Now we are going to see
the demo of this attack.

367
00:23:54,590 --> 00:23:57,230
Here, we have the fake fingerprint

368
00:23:58,441 --> 00:24:03,100
and we are using it to
authenticate ourselves

369
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:08,100
in a Samsung S10 phone
with an ultrasonic sensor.

370
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:13,747
In this case, we use as a mold,

371
00:24:13,747 --> 00:24:17,690
the 3D printing mold that
we were talking before.

372
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:20,390
And for casting we use liquid latex.

373
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:25,160
In this case we use liquid
latex with a skin color,

374
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:30,160
but it's not necessary you
can use any color of latex

375
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,763
and it will work.

376
00:24:35,950 --> 00:24:38,723
For biometric face recognition.

377
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:41,680
Biometric face recognition

378
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:43,587
is the process and ability

379
00:24:43,587 --> 00:24:47,733
to identify the face of an individual

380
00:24:47,733 --> 00:24:50,830
either to grant access to a system

381
00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:54,610
or to find out the details of a person

382
00:24:54,610 --> 00:24:57,900
by matching the face with the data

383
00:24:57,900 --> 00:24:59,393
in the biometric database.

384
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:03,694
What a biometric face reader does

385
00:25:03,694 --> 00:25:08,270
is map and extract the
distinctive features,

386
00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:10,983
for example, these points
and these points here,

387
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:17,900
features of a person face that
can be used for recognition

388
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:21,660
and it stores the data in
the biometric database,

389
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:24,883
along with the identity of the individual.

390
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:28,520
Our next step in this research

391
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:30,967
is to perform presentation attacks

392
00:25:30,967 --> 00:25:35,967
in face recognition systems
by using 3D printed masks

393
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,480
and head to fool the different scanners.

394
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:42,463
Now, we are working on
that and it's really fun.

395
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:48,550
We published a paper of this research

396
00:25:48,550 --> 00:25:51,370
that you can download for more details.

397
00:25:51,370 --> 00:25:53,910
Another interesting research was made

398
00:25:53,910 --> 00:25:56,600
by Paul Rascagneres from Talos.

399
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:59,750
We met in Switzerland when we walked,

400
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:02,920
we're researching about using 3D printers

401
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:05,180
to create fake fingerprints.

402
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:08,170
He used the same 3D printer for the test,

403
00:26:08,170 --> 00:26:09,860
but different software.

404
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:12,100
Also he tested different devices.

405
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:15,710
So if you're interested in this subject,

406
00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:17,320
it is worth to check it out too.

407
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:21,410
It's the first link of
the reference materials.

408
00:26:21,410 --> 00:26:24,780
Also, I have other reference materials,

409
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:29,040
in case some of the topics
discussed in this talk

410
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:33,333
are of interest and you want
to know them a little more.

411
00:26:37,550 --> 00:26:38,470
Thank you.

412
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:41,580
It was an honor to present
this talk at DEF CON.

413
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:46,300
And I also thanks to my
coworkers and friends

414
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:48,710
that helped me with this research,

415
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:51,020
especially (murmur) at the Infosec.

416
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:55,490
That are, they are always there for me.

417
00:26:55,490 --> 00:26:57,353
So stay safe, everyone.
