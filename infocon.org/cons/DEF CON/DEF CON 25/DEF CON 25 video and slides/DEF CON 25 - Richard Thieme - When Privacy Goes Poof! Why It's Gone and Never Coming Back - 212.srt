00:00:00.133-->00:00:06.106
>>Thank you very much. Uh
Twenty-two years is a long time
to watch this grow from uh- what

00:00:06.106-->00:00:11.511
it was to what it is. We used to
be able to say what it was, we
don’t know how to say what it

00:00:11.511-->00:00:16.516
is. Uh, because there are so
many minor Cons going on and the
industry has exploded. And as

00:00:19.019-->00:00:23.991
long as we keep selling
something that we don’t deliver,
it’s gonna just get bigger. So

00:00:23.991-->00:00:30.130
I- I think it’s important to
keep selling security to people
who keep needing it. Kind of

00:00:30.130-->00:00:35.135
like self-help books. If they
worked, there wouldn’t be
another one, you know? But

00:00:38.305-->00:00:43.610
that’s just an aside. Uh, it’s
great to be here. I do want to
mention just briefly, the last

00:00:43.610-->00:00:50.183
year, when I spoke, I addressed
a pretty serious issue which was
the traumatic impact of uh,

00:00:50.183-->00:00:55.255
security work and intelligence
work on professionals who do it
over a prolonged period of time.

00:00:55.255-->00:01:00.827
And those first time I heard
people crying at Def Con because
it brought forth what some of

00:01:00.827-->00:01:05.832
you, um, have experienced over
many, many years, and I’m just
sharing that to say, uh, if you

00:01:08.101-->00:01:12.339
go look at the youtube video,
it’s online. A lot of people
have looked at it. Uh, it’s a

00:01:12.339-->00:01:16.510
serious subject that is seldom
addressed directly and and
successfully inside the

00:01:16.510-->00:01:21.515
agencies, or often by corporate.
Uh, and yet it gets bigger and
bigger as the space gets bigger

00:01:24.117-->00:01:28.522
and bigger. So I, I invite you
if you have any insight or
anything to share with me to

00:01:28.522-->00:01:35.162
please uh follow up on that. Uh,
it continues to plague people. I
got an email just last week from

00:01:35.162-->00:01:41.535
a good friend, long time friend
at NSA. Uh, who said they were
advised to be sure they watch

00:01:41.535-->00:01:45.572
each other’s backs. Well that’s
the kind of advice that is easy
to give and impossible to take,

00:01:45.572-->00:01:51.478
because it’s not very specific.
But the reason he found out was
because uh, three people had

00:01:51.478-->00:01:56.483
committed suicide that week, an-
and one the week before. And I
did quote a friend, uh well, a

00:01:58.652-->00:02:03.590
fellow, at CIA, who said he
bears through his life, 23 and
they were inordinately proud of

00:02:06.693-->00:02:11.298
having the highest rate of
suicide, alcoholism and divorce
and adultery in the government.

00:02:11.298-->00:02:16.303
That was D.O., the Director of
Operations. Um, that’s the
sobering part of the talk. Uh,

00:02:19.306-->00:02:25.545
keep in mind, it’s an uphill
climb to get people to look at
it, including people who are

00:02:25.545-->00:02:30.751
suffering from it, because there
are antidotes. We all bear scars
but there are ways we can live

00:02:30.751-->00:02:36.256
with them um- more successfully
than some other ways. So that’s
what that’s about, is looking at

00:02:36.256-->00:02:42.195
all the different things we can
do to ameliorate the impact of
uh- what it does to us over-

00:02:42.195-->00:02:47.768
over time, to do this work and
to engage with people who are
uh, on the cutting edge. Well

00:02:47.768-->00:02:52.606
what I want to do today, uh,
it’s not a very sexy topic
privacy, why it’s gone.

00:02:52.606-->00:02:59.379
Everybody knows it’s gone, and
you can do a very short speech
on that. Uh, I was in Amsterdam

00:02:59.379-->00:03:04.918
not long ago and I was talking
to a friend who works at a
pretty high level and uh- asked

00:03:04.918-->00:03:10.357
if we will ever get back any
semblance of a protections or
freedoms from intrusion and

00:03:10.357-->00:03:16.363
privacy and she said in a tone
that I’ll never forget, “Oh
Richard, of course not, of

00:03:16.363-->00:03:20.534
course not.” Because the
technologies of intrusion and
surveillance are so deeply

00:03:20.534-->00:03:26.039
embedded in all of our means of
working, living and
communicating with one another

00:03:26.039-->00:03:31.678
today, uh- and it is so
profitable to have them, and so
unprofitable to remove them that

00:03:31.678-->00:03:36.383
we will never get back the
freedoms that we thought we had,
so. She sounded kind of like

00:03:36.383-->00:03:41.988
Michael Corleone in the
Godfather when uh- Kay said,
“but Michael, Senators don’t

00:03:41.988-->00:03:46.993
kill people” and Corleone said,
“Okay, who’s being naive now?”
Um- implying that senators did

00:03:51.031-->00:03:55.335
indeed kill people. I should ask
at this point because it’s
something that just happened to

00:03:55.335-->00:04:01.141
me. How many of you know what I
mean when I say “The Godfather”?
How many of you-? [laughter]

00:04:01.141-->00:04:07.047
Okay, good, good. Let me do a
test because if it happens here,
then I know I’ve got to make

00:04:07.047-->00:04:13.120
some changes. I was doing a talk
uh- for a pretty sizeable
audience, uh- and in Montreal.

00:04:13.120-->00:04:17.991
And I said- I referred to
Chinatown, uh- Jake Gittes
saying-, uh, when they said,

00:04:17.991-->00:04:23.530
“come on, it’s Chinatown, Jake,
it’s Chinatown.” And someone
came up and said nobody knows

00:04:23.530-->00:04:29.936
what you mean. How many of you
have seen the movie Chinatown?
Okay. Thats- thats pretty good.

00:04:29.936-->00:04:35.809
How many of you have seen the
movie, The Conversation? Fewer,
okay, I encourage you to see The

00:04:35.809-->00:04:41.815
Conversation to see what it’s
like. Um- It- it’s a terrific
movie, uh- with Gene Hackman

00:04:41.815-->00:04:46.153
about surveillance. But the
point is, I’d like to be able to
refer to popular culture um-

00:04:46.153-->00:04:51.625
markers and signals that people
recognize. And I learned my
lesson when uh Adam Shostack got

00:04:51.625-->00:04:56.797
up after me and all he had were
slides from Starwars and Rogue
One and everybody knew exactly

00:04:56.797-->00:05:01.434
what he was talking about,
whenever he- he used them. Uh
we’ll touch on that a little

00:05:01.434-->00:05:06.473
later. So, everybody knows that
privacy in the way I just
referred to it is gone but

00:05:06.473-->00:05:10.710
that's the view on the ground
and I want to take us up to
maybe uh- 30, 40, 50, 60

00:05:10.710-->00:05:16.483
thousand feet to look at what it
really means that privacy is
gone because of what it means

00:05:16.483-->00:05:22.088
that our identity has so
radically been altered by the
digitalization and other factors

00:05:22.088-->00:05:28.328
in the world, uh of the 21st
century that privacy is
literally nonexistent. Uh- it’s

00:05:28.328-->00:05:34.601
not whether we can recapture it
or have it. It’s that it doesn’t
exist in the same way that it

00:05:34.601-->00:05:39.806
existed and I want to talk about
why that is with a broad view
over what’s happened to society,

00:05:39.806-->00:05:46.046
uh, including a look at a few
things like words over the last
few hundred years. Privacy is

00:05:46.046-->00:05:49.149
defined as freedom from damaging
publicity, public scrutiny,
secret surveillance,

00:05:49.149-->00:05:54.154
unauthorized disclosure of one’s
personal data or information as
by a government corporation or

00:05:57.424-->00:06:01.094
individual. Uh, as if ordinary
citizens have a right to
privacy. When I read that

00:06:01.094-->00:06:07.334
definition, it is laughable,
because all of that is gone. Uh-
we do not have that freedom. We

00:06:07.334-->00:06:12.305
are not free from any of those
things. Uh and I don’t think we
will be. But what I want to do

00:06:12.305-->00:06:16.843
is try to get us to see that the
20th century framework, within
which we think about these

00:06:16.843-->00:06:22.148
things and our identity is
effectively ending, and it’s
very important to know who you

00:06:22.148-->00:06:27.654
are, so that you can determine
what you do with effectiveness
and uh- and and some clarity.

00:06:27.654-->00:06:32.659
Uh- when- the uh VGA cable
comes, if it ever comes, um-
I’ll put a picture up or two,

00:06:35.528-->00:06:41.501
but let me get into the talk.
I’m going to start with a quote
from Nietzsche. You like to do

00:06:41.501-->00:06:47.073
that at Def Con ‘cause everybody
reads Nietzsche, right? He said
with the unknown one is

00:06:47.073-->00:06:51.111
confronted with danger, in other
words somebody says something to
you that’s totally unknown, uh

00:06:51.111-->00:06:55.949
it’s dangerous it’s causes
discomfort and great care and
the first instinct is to abolish

00:06:55.949-->00:07:01.554
the pain of being in those
states. So this is his first
principle, any explanation is

00:07:01.554-->00:07:07.127
better than none. And since at
bottom what you really wanna do
is get rid of the oppressive

00:07:07.127-->00:07:11.831
information or representation,
you’re not too particular about
the means of getting rid of

00:07:11.831-->00:07:16.503
them. So the first
representation, the first idea,
the first theory that explains

00:07:16.503-->00:07:21.508
everything uh and explains the
unknown in a familiar way, using
the categories of the past, it

00:07:24.244-->00:07:29.249
feels so good that you call it
true. You say we consider that
true. Uh the proof of pleasure

00:07:32.185-->00:07:36.556
is the criterion of truth in
other words, does it alleviate
your cognitive dissonance, does

00:07:36.556-->00:07:41.761
it downplay your anxiety, does
it make you feel better in the
face of the fearfulness of the

00:07:41.761-->00:07:46.766
unknown and the new and so the
fear is the real problem that
confronts us and therefore we

00:07:50.770-->00:07:56.209
have to abolish that feeling uh
and the strange, and the new,
and the hitherto inexperience,

00:07:56.209-->00:08:02.349
must disappear into habitual,
comfortable, familiar,
explorations. And that’s why he

00:08:02.349-->00:08:08.088
says too, we must tell stories
that are untimely by which he
means the consensus reality in

00:08:08.088-->00:08:13.226
which we live at any given
moment is our time, but the
truths that are coming at us

00:08:13.226-->00:08:18.732
faster and faster of the kind
I’m speaking are untimely, we’re
speaking to a future state which

00:08:18.732-->00:08:25.538
is already here but as Gibson
said ‘unevenly distributed’. In
other words, truths the deepest

00:08:25.538-->00:08:30.143
truths you believe about who you
are and your identity are
illusions that we have

00:08:30.143-->00:08:35.648
comfortably and conveniently
forgot were illusions in order
to live with them. And truths

00:08:35.648-->00:08:40.120
held collectively by a group or
organization have to be
confronted on behalf of a future

00:08:40.120-->00:08:45.125
people that will not hold those
truths naively. So we often
embrace truths by which we live

00:08:47.494-->00:08:53.333
because they make us feel better
and alleviate cognitive
dissonance but they're not true.

00:08:53.333-->00:08:57.537
Uh what’s true is what’s real
and as Philip K Dick said,
“reality is that which when we

00:08:57.537-->00:09:02.776
refuse to believe in it won’t go
away” and here we are living
inside a Philip K Dick nov- now

00:09:02.776-->00:09:07.781
how many of you know who Philip
K Dick is? Okay. Pretty savvy
crowd on edge thinkers. Now I

00:09:10.784-->00:09:14.854
spoke in Canada about privacy
about 4 years ago and I thought
I don’t have to ever change the

00:09:14.854-->00:09:21.561
speech I gave in Canada because
it’s the same issues year, after
year, after year, and I spoke

00:09:21.561-->00:09:27.901
for the minister’s privacy not
long ago uh tried to give a
different slant on it and one of

00:09:27.901-->00:09:32.672
the minister’s of privacy from
uh British Columbia said, “That
was a very provocative keynote,

00:09:32.672-->00:09:37.343
but let us hope it’s not true”
and did not realize she was a
proof of concept of that

00:09:37.343-->00:09:43.583
Nietzschean statement I just
made which is, “it’s
provocative, but I don’t want it

00:09:43.583-->00:09:49.055
to be true and therefore because
my job is to be the minister of
privacy I have to treat it as if

00:09:49.055-->00:09:54.060
it is not true even though I
know it is.” Okay. Man’s
plugging stuff in here. Let me

00:10:01.267-->00:10:06.272
make sure the soft porn is not
[laughter] on there >>Like the
hardcorestuff [speaker laughs]

00:10:13.179-->00:10:18.785
[offmic chatter continues]
>>Woops this file was encrypted
[speaker laughs] >>Okay,

00:10:18.785-->00:10:25.725
alright, so that’s gonna be my
image for the hour that Def Con
image I guess. Um somebody's

00:10:25.725-->00:10:31.531
probably doing something to try
to get the other image up. Um
okay so one of the minister’s of

00:10:31.531-->00:10:36.135
privacy got up and um gave a
very very passionate speech
about all the restrictions they

00:10:36.135-->00:10:42.642
have on the government uh and on
society to try to save privacy
and I asked if uh if they really

00:10:42.642-->00:10:46.713
work for the intelligence
community, do they really adhere
to these things? And she said,

00:10:46.713-->00:10:51.518
“Well in theory, in theory”
[laughter] Um and all you can
say is in theory, theory and

00:10:51.518-->00:10:57.557
practice are the same, but in
practice they’re not. [laughter]
Okay so, privacy and security,

00:10:57.557-->00:11:01.694
Matt Blaze once said a long time
ago, “The weakest link in the
security chain is the frequently

00:11:01.694-->00:11:05.899
the definition of the problem,
and the definition of the
problem is often not what we

00:11:05.899-->00:11:11.504
think” that applies to privacy
too, and we’re gonna see how.
Because these are- these are

00:11:11.504-->00:11:16.309
difficult concepts I’m- I’m
trying to advance because they
like the Zen Buddhists say, uh

00:11:16.309-->00:11:20.346
“Enlightenment is a nightmare in
daylight and when you grasp it
suddenly everything else

00:11:20.346-->00:11:25.018
explodes and you have nothing
but space to create new
possibilities if you can stand

00:11:25.018-->00:11:30.023
it” uh and and that’s what we’re
talking about. We’re living by
20th century concepts, and they

00:11:32.125-->00:11:38.765
don’t fit anymore and therefore
we talk about privacy and
security uh actually. Um- as if

00:11:38.765-->00:11:43.970
we know the definitions of the
problems but they’re not what we
think. “A wise person under

00:11:43.970-->00:11:49.509
these conditions steers their
course by the torchlight of
doubt and chaos” and as Niels

00:11:49.509-->00:11:53.179
Bohr said of quantum physics,
“Anyone who isn’t confused,
doesn’t understand what’s going

00:11:53.179-->00:11:59.719
on” I think that’s true about
privacy and security as well.
Okay now let me provide some

00:11:59.719-->00:12:04.657
history. Printing press with
moveable type was introduced to
Europe by Gutenberg in 1439. It

00:12:07.694-->00:12:12.765
played an unimaginably huge role
in the development of the
Renaissance, the Reformation,

00:12:12.765-->00:12:16.636
the Age of Enlightenment, and
the whole scientific revolution
because now could share

00:12:16.636-->00:12:22.375
standardized tables and- and
data for the first time uh in in
history. It laid the material

00:12:22.375-->00:12:27.180
basis for our knowledge based
economy and the spread of
learning to the masses, you

00:12:27.180-->00:12:32.251
cannot overstate the importance
of the printing press. And it
was revolutionary in England

00:12:32.251-->00:12:38.958
when William Caxton brought the
printing press there in 1476.
When something changes the world

00:12:38.958-->00:12:44.397
so radically we exaggerate the
impact, think of what we said
about the internet when it first

00:12:44.397-->00:12:49.402
came, but in the long term we
always underestimate the impact,
again think of the internet. The

00:12:49.402-->00:12:54.974
printing press, like the
internet, like digital reality
is an engine of revolution that

00:12:54.974-->00:12:59.712
is now a catalyst for ev-
revolution in all the other
areas as well, bio, and nano,

00:12:59.712-->00:13:04.651
and uh space technologies, and
material science. Uh and the
acceleration of change has made

00:13:07.487-->00:13:13.226
change happen faster and faster.
So we usually respond to this
the way Virginia St. Pier said

00:13:13.226-->00:13:17.930
we do to grief; first by denying
it and then we get angry about
it, and then we get depressed,

00:13:17.930-->00:13:22.935
and then we uh negotiate with
it, and finally we accept it. Um
but remnants of past behaviors.

00:13:26.472-->00:13:31.344
No you’re not getting an image,
don’t worry about it, don’t
worry about it >>Sorry >>It was

00:13:31.344-->00:13:37.817
beautiful and it was very
important, but ft- don’t worry
about it [laughter] Um I’ll look

00:13:37.817-->00:13:43.389
at it, it’s the cover of my- the
third volume of my novel Foam
and it says, “Identity is

00:13:43.389-->00:13:47.894
destiny” and it shows a man
standing before the universe and
it’s a gorgeous picture- it

00:13:47.894-->00:13:52.131
really is a gorgeous picture and
I mention that only because I
will be signing a few books that

00:13:52.131-->00:13:57.970
I brought after the talk, at
2:30 and 3 at the uh vendor
space uh the other one was going

00:13:57.970-->00:14:01.474
to be just a picture of mind
games because those are the
kinds of games I’m playing with

00:14:01.474-->00:14:06.979
you and I was always gonna- also
gonna show you a picture of the
UFOs in Government book because

00:14:06.979-->00:14:11.217
I continue to get feedback from
numerous sources about the
accuracy of our historical

00:14:11.217-->00:14:16.222
analysis of how the government
responded to that phenomena over
s- sixty years but I won’t show

00:14:18.257-->00:14:24.464
you those pictures we’ll just
leave that aside. [laughter] The
uh remnants of past behavior

00:14:24.464-->00:14:31.137
persist and how prior technology
socialized us and taught us to
behave as they framed our lives,

00:14:31.137-->00:14:34.507
then they went in the
background, but they’re still
there, we just don’t see them,

00:14:34.507-->00:14:39.011
like the electric grid, you
didn’t see the lights, you saw
by the lights when you came in

00:14:39.011-->00:14:42.682
here, you see by virtue of the
lights illuminating, but
electric lights like these

00:14:42.682-->00:14:47.353
they’re only 125 years old,
we’re barely up from the swamp
we’re new creatures in the

00:14:47.353-->00:14:53.559
galaxy and- and so arrogant and
proud like a toddler. Um- but
it’s new, but you still don’t

00:14:53.559-->00:14:57.563
see the power grid, you don’t
plug in uh all of your equipment
and say, “I’m going on the power

00:14:57.563-->00:15:02.769
grid now, so shhhh! Quiet, I’m
on the power grid” you don’t
even see the power grid but if

00:15:02.769-->00:15:06.873
somebody came back here from the
19th century and looked at the
landscape around us, probably

00:15:06.873-->00:15:10.877
the first thing they would
notice is all of the lines and
dynamos uh that are semblance of

00:15:10.877-->00:15:14.814
a power grid that they never
experience and it goes into the
background. The first

00:15:14.814-->00:15:19.819
automobiles had sockets in the
dashboard for buggy whips.
Because uh buggies drawn by

00:15:21.888-->00:15:28.761
horses had sockets in which to
put the buggy whips. Uh then
after awhile they stopped making

00:15:28.761-->00:15:33.766
cars with holes for buggy whips.
A friend remembers when um uh
this is some time ago but it’s a

00:15:37.703-->00:15:44.277
historical statement uh when
they were firing cannons um this
was during World War I that’s

00:15:44.277-->00:15:48.915
how back, far back I go right?
Um and there were people
standing there where they fired

00:15:48.915-->00:15:52.819
the cannons, with their arms out
like this uh at attention he
said, “What are they doing?” he

00:15:52.819-->00:15:56.823
said, “They’re holding the
horses, because the cannon
spooked the horses and they have

00:15:56.823-->00:16:00.126
to hold the bridle,” and he
said, “But we don’t have any
horses anymore, it’s all

00:16:00.126-->00:16:05.131
mechanised” and there was that
dull look of, “Oh.” Uh- so the
people holding the horses stayed

00:16:07.200-->00:16:12.638
long after the horses were gone,
that’s- that’s what we do. And
when Caxton brought the printing

00:16:12.638-->00:16:16.976
press to England printed-
printing revolutionised the
world, and the social worlds in

00:16:16.976-->00:16:20.112
which people lived, the
religious world, the scientific
world, the cultural world,

00:16:20.112-->00:16:26.052
everything. They had to choose a
dialect in which to print, and
that became what we call

00:16:26.052-->00:16:31.123
standard English. And as
standard English permeated a
larger and larger group it

00:16:31.123-->00:16:37.063
permeated what we later called
England, which did not exist yet
until the social institutions

00:16:37.063-->00:16:42.001
that supported it had been
created by the technologies
which people no longer as saw as

00:16:42.001-->00:16:47.006
causal but were. So the language
printing imposed homogenized a
culture over time and political,

00:16:49.075-->00:16:53.946
and economic, and social
consequences soon followed. So
it changed how we thought. It

00:16:53.946-->00:16:58.951
changed more fundamentally, who
we were. Now we need the
language to use to understand

00:17:02.755-->00:17:09.395
who we have become that we are
in the process now of inventing.
You can’t think what you can’t

00:17:09.395-->00:17:15.868
say, and the language of the
past is inadequate to describe
what a human being has become

00:17:15.868-->00:17:22.041
today by virtue of technologies.
Give you an example of words
that you use all the time that

00:17:22.041-->00:17:27.980
were um that were invented
during a very fecund period, a
very fertile period, 1918 to

00:17:27.980-->00:17:34.854
1923 after World War I when the
flapper era had exploded uh and
the- and the good- good feeling

00:17:34.854-->00:17:39.859
era followed before the
depression. Um these are words
which did not exist before then.

00:17:44.363-->00:17:50.169
Cool, extrovert, fascist,
mass-media, debunk, encode,
hyper-modern, multipurpose,

00:17:50.169-->00:17:56.409
powerplay, teenage, which was
invented as a stage of life at
the same time. Post-feminist,

00:17:56.409-->00:18:02.882
biracial, slinky,
sado-masochistic, homosexuality,
fundamentalism, psyching,

00:18:02.882-->00:18:08.821
devalue, uh one of my favorites
uh ‘cause I can’t imagine the
Samuel L Jackson movie without

00:18:08.821-->00:18:15.494
it, the word motherf**ker came
into play in 1918 for the first
time. One can only imagine the

00:18:15.494-->00:18:20.499
circumstances under which that
took place [laughter] right?
Frenchkiss, f**koff, I’m not

00:18:25.171-->00:18:30.209
telling you to f**koff I’m
telling you that’s a phrase
that, uh deflationary, merchant

00:18:30.209-->00:18:36.315
bank, arbi- I could go on and on
and on these did not exist but
now we can say them and think

00:18:36.315-->00:18:41.887
them because the language
emerged to describe new social
and cultural realities that

00:18:41.887-->00:18:47.593
previously we had no way of
identifying. Um it’s it’s like
hacker, you know what’s happened

00:18:47.593-->00:18:52.832
to the word hacker, right?
Overtime. Uh it used to mean a
hacker, uh when I first started

00:18:52.832-->00:18:57.837
speaking at Def Con, Def Con 4,
it was a convention of hackers
um now there are some we used to

00:18:59.972-->00:19:05.644
play ‘spot the fed’ here, now
you’re all feds so we play spot
the hacker [laughter] it’s uh,

00:19:05.644-->00:19:12.585
it’s a more appropriate game uh
what is a hacker today? Well you
hear black hat hacker, gray hat

00:19:12.585-->00:19:16.756
hacker and white hat hacker. uh
I’ll tell you the real
definitions those, the black hat

00:19:16.756-->00:19:22.528
hacker is a hacker, right? A
gray hat hacker is a hacker who
put the truth down somewhere,

00:19:22.528-->00:19:27.099
but knows where he put it.
[laughter] A white hat hacker is
someone who put the truth down

00:19:27.099-->00:19:33.839
somewhere and forgot where it
is. In other words, I haven’t
met yet a white hat hacker who

00:19:33.839-->00:19:39.178
is only a white hat hacker, it’s
a definition of convenience,
because in the old days at any

00:19:39.178-->00:19:44.483
rate the only way you learn by
hacking uh the only way you
learned to hack was by hacking

00:19:44.483-->00:19:49.889
and it was a passionate
commitment to doing anything you
needed to do, to look at things

00:19:49.889-->00:19:55.061
in a new way and learn from
them. We need new language to
articulate what we experience

00:19:55.061-->00:19:59.265
and grasp the nature of the
context in which we live, we
need new language today to

00:19:59.265-->00:20:05.805
discuss ethics, spirituality,
and identity, and privacy. The
weakest link in the discussion

00:20:05.805-->00:20:11.377
in privacy, is the definition of
privacy, and the definition of
privacy is not what we think.

00:20:11.377-->00:20:18.217
Let us give, give true props to
what this technology has done.
When we invent a technology like

00:20:18.217-->00:20:23.389
this Langdon Winner computer
scientist said, “Society also
invents the kinds of people who

00:20:23.389-->00:20:28.494
will use it, older practices,
relationships, and ways of
defining identity fall by the

00:20:28.494-->00:20:33.732
wayside. New practices,
relationships and identities
take root. In case after case

00:20:33.732-->00:20:38.537
the move to computerise and
digitize means pre-existing
cultural forms have suddenly

00:20:38.537-->00:20:44.043
gone liquid, like an ice cube in
your hand, losing their former
shape as they are restructured

00:20:44.043-->00:20:49.815
for computerized expression and
as these new patterns solidify,
both useful artifacts and the

00:20:49.815-->00:20:53.652
texture of human relationships
that surround them will be much
different than what existed

00:20:53.652-->00:20:59.525
previously.” In other words I’m
trying to emphasize how big this
really is and yet our minds keep

00:20:59.525-->00:21:05.798
it small in order to let us live
in it day by day. It wasn’t long
ago that people spoke of going

00:21:05.798-->00:21:10.803
on the internet. I mean, really
not long ago. Uh but I talk to
children today who don’t know

00:21:12.805-->00:21:18.110
what it means to ‘go on the
internet’ because they are
always on the internet. And I’m-

00:21:18.110-->00:21:22.481
I could show you a picture if if
they could get the technology to
work, it’s very complicated

00:21:22.481-->00:21:27.486
[laughter] um of a recent
dinner, I moved to Minneapolis a
great city and um my wife and

00:21:29.922-->00:21:35.294
daughter and two grandchildren
were sitting uh and eating and
every single person, except me

00:21:35.294-->00:21:42.034
who had a digital camera to take
the picture, was on an ipad or
an iphone uh in the booth and I

00:21:42.034-->00:21:46.572
have to believe some of them
were texting each other so that
the communication among family

00:21:46.572-->00:21:52.178
was not totally down but from
the bleeps and squeaks of the
games the kids were playing I

00:21:52.178-->00:21:57.183
don’t think that’s what was
happening. So new technology
socializes us to their context.

00:21:59.318-->00:22:03.989
Uh telephone voices sounded
weird back when the telephone
was invented they sounded

00:22:03.989-->00:22:08.227
unnatural and yet when the
internet first came forward
somebody at a radio station

00:22:08.227-->00:22:13.199
wanted to interview me about all
of this and she said, “Uh call
me, don’t send me an email, I

00:22:13.199-->00:22:18.370
wanna speak to a real person”
[laughter] and I had to explain
how telephones work ‘cause it

00:22:18.370-->00:22:23.475
was electronic signal blah blah
blah wasn’t a real person uh
and- and yet today you get an

00:22:23.475-->00:22:28.614
email or a text from a real
person, you assume it’s real,
well and then there’s that whole

00:22:28.614-->00:22:33.752
other problem that it is- often
isn’t but that’s a totally
different question. Okay so I

00:22:33.752-->00:22:37.790
talked about England briefly in
order to introduce that subject
and when I used the words

00:22:37.790-->00:22:41.160
English and England I bet you
thought we had a common
understanding of what we meant

00:22:41.160-->00:22:46.298
but in fact what we mean when we
say the name of any nation’s
state is no longer what it used

00:22:46.298-->00:22:51.770
to be. It uh isn’t the same
because the boundaries around
nation states have become first

00:22:51.770-->00:22:56.842
semi permeable and porous and
then they went down. In the 90s
when I was talking to people in

00:22:56.842-->00:23:01.647
the intelligence community about
the impact this had on the work,
CIA and NSA and others were

00:23:01.647-->00:23:06.151
doing, because they’ve gotta be
well ahead of us. When I talk to
people at CIA about scientific,

00:23:06.151-->00:23:12.258
biological stuff, it’s- keep in
mind that anything I tell you uh
was 20 years ago and anything

00:23:12.258-->00:23:18.664
anybody knows out there is gonna
be 20 years ago because we’re-
the- we’re working uh a little

00:23:18.664-->00:23:25.537
further ahead than that and and
so um [clears throat] how many
of you been to a Shakespeare

00:23:25.537-->00:23:30.542
play in the last year? Really?
What a group, honest to god, I
mean it’s- it’s wonderful. How

00:23:33.612-->00:23:38.884
many of you seen the Star Wars
movie? Oh more than went to a
Shakespeare play okay [laughter]

00:23:38.884-->00:23:44.957
okay. Uh when you’re going to a
Shakespeare play, we think we
are understanding Elizabethan

00:23:44.957-->00:23:49.895
English which is being spoken
unless it’s been changed to make
it more palatable. But at least

00:23:49.895-->00:23:55.000
25 percent of the words being
used mean something different
than what you think they mean.

00:23:55.000-->00:23:58.904
In other words, language is a
dynamic process in which
meanings are constantly

00:23:58.904-->00:24:05.311
changing, adding, disappearing,
and morphing and it’s uh a
matrix, a social, cultural

00:24:05.311-->00:24:11.283
matrix that evolves evolution
early as we do and yet we think
that what we say and what we see

00:24:11.283-->00:24:15.587
by virtue of what we say is
what’s real and what’s always
been, and I’m trying to make the

00:24:15.587-->00:24:20.926
point that it isn’t. And the
word I want emphasized is
individual. When you hear the

00:24:20.926-->00:24:27.232
word individual as Shakespeare
used it, it meant something,
some quality that was unified or

00:24:27.232-->00:24:33.972
indivisible. Now we’re talking
about the late 1500s early
1600s, it did not mean an

00:24:33.972-->00:24:38.977
individual person. When you say,
“I’m an individual” you think of
yourself as an individual being,

00:24:41.080-->00:24:46.085
that didn’t show up for another
couple of hundred years, until
the 17th century, 18th century,

00:24:49.321-->00:24:55.561
the definition of individuality
meant quote, “The state or
quality of being indivisible and

00:24:55.561-->00:25:02.434
inseparable” it didn't’ mean a
human being. In other words the
notion and the appropriation of

00:25:02.434-->00:25:07.506
the notion of what it meant to
be a human being, an individual
human being, emerged as an

00:25:07.506-->00:25:11.777
emergent property for the
cultural and social changes, the
technology, the times, and

00:25:11.777-->00:25:18.450
especially the printing press
which I’ll get back to were
occasioning. So the change in

00:25:18.450-->00:25:22.721
the meaning of the word
individuality is related to the
breakup of the entire medieval

00:25:22.721-->00:25:27.693
social, economic, and religious
order. We think that is a
historical event, but at the

00:25:27.693-->00:25:34.366
time it was monumental and
transformational and so is our
own. But if we look at it in too

00:25:34.366-->00:25:39.705
granular of a way, we don’t see
what’s happened. The new use of
individual helped define a

00:25:39.705-->00:25:46.545
person’s place in a society that
was emerging into reality as
well because an individual human

00:25:46.545-->00:25:52.484
can live independently of
society and make his or her own
decisions. The person has enough

00:25:52.484-->00:25:57.523
knowledge to exist alone without
clinging to society and
therefore what it meant to be

00:25:57.523-->00:26:04.430
human fundamentally changed from
being just part of a whole to
having a boundary around you

00:26:04.430-->00:26:09.134
which defined your identity in
the same way that the boundaries
around nation states grew during

00:26:09.134-->00:26:15.474
the 17th, 18th, and 19th
centuries and defined nations
states uh up until Westphalian

00:26:15.474-->00:26:20.879
and and the treaty that helped
define them in a way that no
longer holds. I got a good

00:26:20.879-->00:26:26.752
example of this when I was
speaking for the FBI and I was
talking about how places uh

00:26:26.752-->00:26:31.857
entities invented for this
country and or to work in this
country and to work abroad, uh

00:26:31.857-->00:26:38.197
used to be distinctive uh but
now foreign and domestic no
longer have the same meanings uh

00:26:38.197-->00:26:42.601
anymore than natural and
artificial have the same
meanings, we’ve blurred those

00:26:42.601-->00:26:47.506
lines so much and the head of
the office, the agent in charge
of the Chicago office the FBI

00:26:47.506-->00:26:54.012
said, “Bingo, that explains why
I’m getting the reactions I am.”
What he was talking about was-

00:26:54.012-->00:26:58.717
now the FBI was set up as a
police organization in this
country, the CIA was set up uh

00:26:58.717-->00:27:03.789
to do espionage in every other
country. That’s why at that
first talk I gave at Def Con 4 I

00:27:03.789-->00:27:08.594
could say, “You wanna hack? Come
on in, come in under the
umbrella, you get the best

00:27:08.594-->00:27:13.065
tools, the best techniques, and
the best mentors in the business
if you come into the agency, and

00:27:13.065-->00:27:19.638
you get a get out of jail free
card as well”, because all of
the hacking that you know is

00:27:19.638-->00:27:25.077
just part of the vast subset of
hacking that we have developed
as many people now know more

00:27:25.077-->00:27:31.717
than they did, in more detail uh
to hack other countries. Uh we
don’t have any friends someone

00:27:31.717-->00:27:36.722
said, Deputy Director of- Sigit
actually at NSA we have only
targets. And he was trying to

00:27:39.925-->00:27:44.696
calm down the guy who said the
English are special friends, we
have a special relationship, he

00:27:44.696-->00:27:50.369
said we have no friends, we have
only targets, and it’s everybody
else. So CIA was set up to be

00:27:50.369-->00:27:55.774
that way in 1947 it’s what our
security world, our national
security state has developed as

00:27:55.774-->00:28:00.379
a necessity and I’m not
criticizing that I’m just saying
it’s it’s what’s so. So the FBI

00:28:00.379-->00:28:03.882
was supposed to be here and the
CIA was supposed to be there,
but here and there no longer

00:28:03.882-->00:28:10.255
mean the same things so the FBI
works all over the world now,
and CIA is of course operating

00:28:10.255-->00:28:16.528
overtly now as for example with
the New York Police Department
by s- by design, statements are

00:28:16.528-->00:28:22.334
by design to make a point, but
the CIA is all over the place,
inside as well, because the

00:28:22.334-->00:28:27.339
boundaries are down and the
nature of the information state
that we inhabit means you have

00:28:27.339-->00:28:32.578
to go where the information goes
and see where it comes from and
nation state boundaries don’t

00:28:32.578-->00:28:37.416
matter anymore. What the FBI man
was saying is that the real
sources of power and influence

00:28:37.416-->00:28:43.155
on us, on our lives, that which
directs our behavior, are
transnational. They are

00:28:43.155-->00:28:48.694
sometimes entities that again,
have no names, that don’t have
names, but they’re not just

00:28:48.694-->00:28:53.498
nation states, so we kind of
co-exist like a parallax view
between seeing nation state as

00:28:53.498-->00:28:57.402
operative and knowing that the
real source of our behavior is
something else. How much

00:28:57.402-->00:29:02.074
business is Microsoft or Apple
doing somewhere else? Much more
than 50 percent, we think

00:29:02.074-->00:29:05.644
they’re American companies,
they’re not, they’re companies
and they have their own

00:29:05.644-->00:29:11.617
independence and their own
operations and their influencing
power on us supersedes that

00:29:11.617-->00:29:16.154
which we think is patriotic and
that’s what the FBI special
agent was trying to say. “I used

00:29:16.154-->00:29:21.360
to be able to invite people to
cooperate with the FBI, and they
always did out of patriotic

00:29:21.360-->00:29:27.599
motivation” he said “but now
more and more I’ll get the
answer, ‘I’d like to help you

00:29:27.599-->00:29:33.605
but-’” And that ‘but’ is the
substantiation of the- they know
that the true source of their

00:29:33.605-->00:29:39.311
power is not the country in the
same way that it was. Which is
why the political rhetoric we’re

00:29:39.311-->00:29:45.984
hearing today which is so 20th
century, or before, uh the
political rhetoric is a 20th

00:29:45.984-->00:29:50.422
century framework that’s not
describing any of the realities
that are impacting people’s

00:29:50.422-->00:29:54.459
lives, and that’s why the
solutions defined in 20th
century terms can’t work in the

00:29:54.459-->00:30:01.299
21st century because we’re a
totally different kind of su-
economy and society. Well why am

00:30:01.299-->00:30:06.304
I bothering going into all this?
Well, because privacy as we have
used the word has meaning only

00:30:08.707-->00:30:15.614
for an individual. Which was an
emergent property, I say. Only
for an individual. Privacy is

00:30:15.614-->00:30:21.720
something that an individual
has. And this meaning of
individual no longer applies to

00:30:21.720-->00:30:26.725
humans today, not in the same
way, not really. We always knew
we were cells in the body, but

00:30:29.061-->00:30:34.066
we used to emphasize the fact
that we were cells, individuals,
now we have to see bodiness. And

00:30:36.435-->00:30:41.406
when digitalization took over
people experience themselves
more powerfully as nodes in a

00:30:41.406-->00:30:47.946
network and it restructured how
we had to work in teams. You
never heard of uh work teams or-

00:30:47.946-->00:30:52.350
in in the same way, you never
heard of teachers having to
teach people how to work in

00:30:52.350-->00:30:58.690
teams. In my day when we tried
to work cooperatively I was
usually nailed for cheating,

00:30:58.690-->00:31:04.796
‘cause that’s what we called it
then it- we were told to do your
work alone, individually, don’t

00:31:04.796-->00:31:08.834
look at any other- anybody
else’s work. That’s been totally
transformed by the technology or

00:31:08.834-->00:31:13.839
learning and action. So what is
privacy mean in this new world?
And what is contingent on it,

00:31:16.308-->00:31:21.613
and why does it matter? Well
Andrew Grove whose one of the
founders of Intel said long ago,

00:31:21.613-->00:31:26.051
almost 20 years ago, “Privacy is
the big problem of the
electronic age, at the heart of

00:31:26.051-->00:31:29.821
the internet culture is a source
that wants to find out
everything about you, and once

00:31:29.821-->00:31:34.025
it has found out everything
about you and 200 million
others, that’s a pretty valuable

00:31:34.025-->00:31:38.263
asset so people will be
tempted,” isn’t that naive?
“That they’ll be tempted” today

00:31:38.263-->00:31:42.567
they do it all the time, “to
trade and do commerce with the
asset,” which is the information

00:31:42.567-->00:31:47.405
about you that you have freely
given them a la Facebook,
etcetera uh all unknowingly

00:31:47.405-->00:31:53.812
given them the commodity that is
yourself in terms of the data
that you provide simply by

00:31:53.812-->00:32:00.152
existing in that online world.
That wasn’t the information that
people were thinking of, he

00:32:00.152-->00:32:05.123
said, when they called that-
called this the information age.
Commentators said we think of

00:32:05.123-->00:32:09.327
privacy is tremendously
valuable, we call it uh a human
right, but we live in the

00:32:09.327-->00:32:15.300
Facebook age and the only thing
more cherished than privacy is
publicity. We share personal

00:32:15.300-->00:32:19.070
data in flagrant ways but
believe we have a right to
privacy when we choose to keep

00:32:19.070-->00:32:24.075
things private which we can not
do anymore. So privacy is a
human right? Well privacy became

00:32:26.511-->00:32:32.150
real around the same time that
rights became real. You know
that people, before this

00:32:32.150-->00:32:36.221
transformation in society, you
lived in one room. I mean you
didn’t say, “I’m going upstairs

00:32:36.221-->00:32:39.658
to have sex now.” Everything
took place- the animals lived
with you, you know you look at a

00:32:39.658-->00:32:45.964
castle keep in the winter,
everybody lived in one place,
the idea of wh- uh we uh

00:32:45.964-->00:32:50.402
entitled Americans saying, “I
want a room of my own” every
child gets a room of their own?

00:32:50.402-->00:32:56.808
It It was literally unthinkable
because nobody did that. Well
privacy emerged at the same time

00:32:56.808-->00:33:00.345
that rights emerged. In other
words they became cognitive
artifacts, what I call the

00:33:00.345-->00:33:06.251
structures we have internally
that we believe in as if they’re
real, but which have emerged as

00:33:06.251-->00:33:11.423
a response to the changes in
society and above all the
information flow which defines

00:33:11.423-->00:33:16.428
um and limits. So rights. We say
rights came from the Magna Carta
but until they were conceived as

00:33:20.498-->00:33:25.537
we do recently, we didn’t see
the Magna Carta that way at all.
The people doing the Magna Carta

00:33:25.537-->00:33:30.642
did not see it as an
instantiation of rights.
Intellectual property and

00:33:30.642-->00:33:36.181
intellectual property rights
only became possible after the
printing press externalized the

00:33:36.181-->00:33:41.152
products of our thinking as if
they were artifacts with
boundaries around them. And

00:33:41.152-->00:33:45.156
boundaries, as I keep saying,
determine identity and
boundaries around everything

00:33:45.156-->00:33:50.629
from individuals to nation
states and I suggest planetary
culture are going down.

00:33:50.629-->00:33:55.734
Everybody knows we’re not alone
in the universe, but we don’t
know that we know it, because

00:33:55.734-->00:34:00.939
the authoritative voice
continues to refuse to validate
the observations of thousands of

00:34:00.939-->00:34:05.944
people uh that suggest something
else is going on. That’s a whole
other talk. Uh the fact is we

00:34:08.446-->00:34:13.985
are not alone in the universe,
we are part of a sentient web of
intelligence that spans galaxies

00:34:13.985-->00:34:17.756
and we have been thinking we’re
the apple of God’s eye, and the
product of a special

00:34:17.756-->00:34:24.229
intelligence that only wanted us
on this Earth to evolve the way
we did. So vain. As the

00:34:24.229-->00:34:29.234
president would say, “sad. Sad.”
[laughter] Doesn’t speak in
paragraphs, gets his point

00:34:31.703-->00:34:36.708
across though. Paragraphs are
going the way of cursive
writing, honestly um Richard

00:34:40.045-->00:34:46.351
Stallman who many of you know,
great new guru uh defending open
source sof- software said,

00:34:46.351-->00:34:51.589
“there’s no intrinsic right to
intellectual property.” The idea
of copyright didn’t exist before

00:34:51.589-->00:34:54.159
when authors copied everything
from one another um and you know
that if you look at manuscripts

00:34:54.159-->00:34:56.161
made in monasteries you see that
people wrote in the margins all
the time, copied each other,

00:34:56.161-->00:34:59.631
there was no thought, “I’m
stealing” and I tried to get
some professors who I once

00:34:59.631-->00:35:04.569
consulted with to understand
this, they were very upset about
plagiarism which their students

00:35:08.707-->00:35:12.911
were doing, but in a cut and
paste world where pieces of
information came and went

00:35:12.911-->00:35:17.916
without identity, without
source, without retribution uh
or attribution. Um plagiarism

00:35:20.919-->00:35:26.691
was ceasing to mean what it did
when things were defined in a
textual environment so

00:35:26.691-->00:35:31.262
substitute privacy for
Stallman’s statement on
copyright, “there’s no intrinsic

00:35:31.262-->00:35:35.834
right to privacy, because the
forces that made it viable, the
social, economic, religious,

00:35:35.834-->00:35:41.139
legal forces have been
transformed and are blurring and
disappearing and so printing

00:35:41.139-->00:35:47.078
changed everything. That’s my
point. And so has the internet.
And so are the other domains of

00:35:47.078-->00:35:52.650
advancement to which I can only
allude, like bio. The revolution
in information and communication

00:35:52.650-->00:35:58.490
is the axis around which a 20th-
first century world turns right
now. Privacy is on in lip

00:35:58.490-->00:36:04.295
service but not in the
marketplace where it is violated
or taken away every single day.

00:36:04.295-->00:36:09.300
It’s not honored intelligence
operations certainly we all all
know that. It- it can’t be, it

00:36:11.536-->00:36:16.541
can’t be. And it’s not honored
in how computers and softwares
are built. A rockstar once said,

00:36:19.010-->00:36:24.482
“If voting were important, they
wouldn’t let us do it” well if
privacy was important, it would

00:36:24.482-->00:36:30.488
be honored in fact, and it
isn’t. I mean you have to take a
good look sometimes, look at the

00:36:30.488-->00:36:34.659
vendor space sometimes at a
thing like Black Hat, a friend
of mine who's been in the

00:36:34.659-->00:36:37.495
business a long time looked out
and he said “every single one of
these people is selling

00:36:37.495-->00:36:42.400
something they can not deliver,”
because they guarantee they’re
going to ensure safety and

00:36:42.400-->00:36:47.405
security for the enterprise and
they can not do that. But that’s
an aside. Someone said, well I

00:36:54.245-->00:36:59.117
said that uh other things are
much more important than
privacy. Power is more important

00:36:59.117-->00:37:04.222
and money is more important. The
Onion run- once ran an article
saying customers are our most

00:37:04.222-->00:37:10.095
important, second most important
factor. Um of course everybody
says customers the most

00:37:10.095-->00:37:15.033
important, but they mean after
money, after money. The internet
of things, you know what it’s

00:37:15.033-->00:37:18.937
like, we’ve got a village
dedicated to hacking all the
aspects of it here, it ignores

00:37:18.937-->00:37:24.576
privacy as software companies do
in a rush to market. I remember
Bill Gates saying years ago, um

00:37:24.576-->00:37:27.212
“show me something that I can
fix, I’ll spend a million
dollars to do it, show me

00:37:27.212-->00:37:32.217
something that makes me 2 days
late to market forget it” Time
to get to market matters more.

00:37:34.285-->00:37:39.290
Privacy advocates and they’re
all over here, well meaning,
righteous, and sincere are

00:37:41.426-->00:37:46.431
fighting a rearguard reaction-
action with reality itself, and
reality always wins. So children

00:37:50.935-->00:37:57.475
today are growing up without an
expectation of privacy, and
without an understanding of what

00:37:57.475-->00:38:02.413
we mean by privacy, because
their social world has taught
them a different way of being,

00:38:04.983-->00:38:09.354
which is, it’s all out there.
Sure you can have great movies
about living off the grid, but

00:38:09.354-->00:38:14.359
try it. Um you you wind up
looking like the unabomber,
right? And even he had to use a

00:38:17.195-->00:38:22.967
bus to get his bombs to San
Francisco so he could trust
others to mail them. You can’t

00:38:22.967-->00:38:28.673
really live off the grid unless
you’re living with wolves in a
cave. I said in a forecast of

00:38:28.673-->00:38:33.378
security issues I was asked to
identify years ago, 20 years
ago, that the only way to

00:38:33.378-->00:38:39.484
protect data is not to collect
it in the first place. That was
true, it’s still true, and it’s

00:38:39.484-->00:38:45.323
totally ignored. We give it
away, or we allow it to be
taken. As if it is of no account

00:38:45.323-->00:38:50.161
because we can not see or feel
the ends to which data analytics
put our autobiographical bits,

00:38:50.161-->00:38:54.766
every daily choice that we make,
and everyone who can collects
data, and everyone who knows how

00:38:54.766-->00:38:59.470
to do it parses it together, not
data but information.
“Information,” remember Claude

00:38:59.470-->00:39:04.676
Shannon said, “is the difference
that makes a difference.” Well
this information makes a huge

00:39:04.676-->00:39:08.947
difference, not the noise but
the data that creates
information, the signal and it

00:39:08.947-->00:39:13.952
gives those that know how to
extract it from the data
leverage, power, and money. Bits

00:39:16.154-->00:39:22.460
of data that make up us our
gestalt, our identity. They now
are combined at that level of

00:39:22.460-->00:39:27.465
abstraction in different ways.
And they see something different
when they look at us than we see

00:39:29.701-->00:39:35.974
ourselves. The point of this
talk, if you want a takeaway, is
that the level of abstraction at

00:39:35.974-->00:39:42.447
which you can view either an
entity, an organization, or a
human being, determines what you

00:39:42.447-->00:39:48.119
believe is real and people who
do data analytics are looking at
a level of abstraction which is

00:39:48.119-->00:39:53.124
so very real, as as yo- as we
all know, but we act as if we
are still the 20th century

00:39:55.426-->00:40:00.999
selves that emerged when we were
children or growing up, and we
haven’t really grasped that we

00:40:00.999-->00:40:07.238
are known better than we know
ourselves. It’s like the zen
statements about the illusion of

00:40:07.238-->00:40:13.344
the self, well we believe in
ourselves, we believe ourselves
are ourselves, and I’m trying to

00:40:13.344-->00:40:17.081
make the point, it’s very hard
to get, this is why it’s a
nightmare in daylight if you

00:40:17.081-->00:40:22.320
really grasp it, that the
fundamental assumptions we make
about d***n near everything are

00:40:22.320-->00:40:28.593
no longer workable in the frame
we have unknowingly created by
participating, as all of us have

00:40:28.593-->00:40:34.999
in this room, in this new
technological society. We are
not the same people we once

00:40:34.999-->00:40:40.238
were, and so defining who we are
and our prerogatives and needs
has to be done in light of who

00:40:40.238-->00:40:45.276
we have become. We’re talking
about identity. Uh in uh Blade
Runner, he was looking at the

00:40:45.276-->00:40:50.148
photographs, I know you know
that movie, and he said,
“Memories, you’re talking about

00:40:50.148-->00:40:54.085
memories,” well now we know we
can create memories in different
ways, in my talk on biohacking

00:40:54.085-->00:40:59.223
one of the things I looked at
which my friend at the CIA
helped me understand was that we

00:40:59.223-->00:41:04.529
really are working seriously in
implanting memories, implanting
memories of someone else’s

00:41:04.529-->00:41:11.436
experience, not just using
techniques to efface memory uh
the way we have in the past

00:41:11.436-->00:41:17.308
which is what media does, media
creates memory uh and then we
share our memories if it’s real,

00:41:17.308-->00:41:22.313
and if it comforts us uh we
become a voting block. Alright.
So Walter Ong looked at all of

00:41:24.349-->00:41:30.121
this some time ago, looking at
our reality and literacy and the
technology as in the word and he

00:41:30.121-->00:41:33.758
said, “the shift from our
reality to literacy in non
electronic processing engages

00:41:33.758-->00:41:38.162
social, economic, political,
religious, and other structures,
and creates an entire difference

00:41:38.162-->00:41:43.000
in mentality, in who we think we
are,” he said “in who we
experience ourselves to be.”

00:41:43.000-->00:41:48.906
Writing, restructured
consciousness, you see. Writing
transformed human consciousness.

00:41:48.906-->00:41:54.712
Oral cultures contained human
beings who were not the same
humans but began to write, and

00:41:54.712-->00:41:59.684
the printing press did it again,
and engaging as we do
immersively in the digital world

00:41:59.684-->00:42:04.622
is doing it one more time. Our
consciousness is literally being
restructured in a different way.

00:42:07.325-->00:42:11.462
So all of the arguments against
computerization were the same
ones they used against the

00:42:11.462-->00:42:15.600
printing press and writing.
Plato said the same things when
the oral culture was ending,

00:42:15.600-->00:42:19.837
“It’s going to destroy
humanity,” No it’s going to
transform humanity and the

00:42:19.837-->00:42:25.610
humanity you thought- thought
you were a part of is no longer
going to exist. Kids today are

00:42:25.610-->00:42:30.314
criticized because they multiply
in their heads, or write
cursive, they use Google instead

00:42:30.314-->00:42:36.020
of remembering things, but they
don’t know any loss from their
experience, they experience no

00:42:36.020-->00:42:42.760
loss, why should I write cursive
when I can type with my thumb,
or write block letters? Uh why

00:42:42.760-->00:42:47.298
should I multiply when all I
have to do is enter in the data
and it multiplies it for me? Why

00:42:47.298-->00:42:51.969
should I remember something
which is so ready at hand? Why
should I ask somebody how to get

00:42:51.969-->00:42:56.974
to Grandma’s house when all I
have to do is- pointing at the
clock, watch? Where are we? Wrap

00:42:59.877-->00:43:04.849
it up? You told me you were
going to tell me when I had 10
minutes? [inaudible off-mic

00:43:04.849-->00:43:10.855
comment] you should have put it
in my uh presentation, I would
have seen it on the screen

00:43:10.855-->00:43:15.860
[laughs] [laughter] Well. Sorry.
Uh he’s telling me to stop uh I
hate to stop ‘cause I love to

00:43:19.697-->00:43:24.702
talk [laughter] but uh uh I uh
I’m just gonna quote a couple of
people and then I’m gonna wrap

00:43:28.372-->00:43:34.612
it up uh this is an old quote
but it still tells you how they
were thinking at MIT some years

00:43:34.612-->00:43:40.118
ago uh when we do the kind of
data analysis I was talking
about we get a God’s eye view of

00:43:40.118-->00:43:43.721
human behavior uh we can tell
how they’re gonna vote, we’re
gonna tell when they- can tell

00:43:43.721-->00:43:47.992
when they’re getting sick, we’ve
turned society into a laboratory
where behavior can be

00:43:47.992-->00:43:52.830
effectively followed but also
we’re effecting in changing
behavior and you think you have

00:43:52.830-->00:43:58.069
privacy, we’re getting genetic
sniffers that when you walk
through a space you inhabit,

00:43:58.069-->00:44:02.206
somebody will be able to pick up
your DNA from the shed skin
cells that you are fusing into

00:44:02.206-->00:44:06.711
the air and they will be able to
do a DNA analysis as we increase
our ability to do that quickly

00:44:06.711-->00:44:11.716
and cheaply uh there is no place
to hide. Uh so, the good news is
uh that someone wanted is that

00:44:15.253-->00:44:20.691
it’s real and we can always deal
with what’s real but we have to
grasp who we really are in terms

00:44:20.691-->00:44:25.930
of what I’ve been describing uh
the world can not be talked
about as if it’s a 20th century

00:44:25.930-->00:44:30.935
world, not politics, not ethics,
not religions, not anything. And
the good news is, we can become

00:44:33.671-->00:44:39.777
conscious of this, as we have in
the past, and then make
reasonable, powerful decisions

00:44:39.777-->00:44:45.082
about who we are in light of it,
and rethink what it means to be
ethical uh rethink what it means

00:44:45.082-->00:44:50.421
to be human because humans have
always had a different
definition of self understanding

00:44:50.421-->00:44:54.592
in different cultures, and it’s
no different now, it’s just a
different kind of challenge

00:44:54.592-->00:44:59.063
because it continues to change
so radically and so rapidly. So
those who wanna be in the

00:44:59.063-->00:45:05.036
cutting edge will at least know
how to surf the waves of
information that restore our

00:45:05.036-->00:45:10.942
sanity and wholeness in health
to the being who is doing this
and that here more than anywhere

00:45:10.942-->00:45:15.947
else that I go, is you men and
women. Thank you for your
attention. [applause] Thank you.

00:45:22.620-->00:45:23.854
Thanks!
