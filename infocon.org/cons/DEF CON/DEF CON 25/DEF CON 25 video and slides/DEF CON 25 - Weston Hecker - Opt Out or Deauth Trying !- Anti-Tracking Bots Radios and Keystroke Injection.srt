00:00:00.000-->00:00:04.958
>>Uh, topic of this talk is opt
out or deauth trying. It's going
to be anti-uh, tracking, bots,

00:00:04.958-->00:00:09.375
radios, and keystroke injection.
It's going to be throwing off
brick and mortar stores. Um, the

00:00:09.375-->00:00:14.250
ways that they're tracking you.
Um, everything from billboards,
um down to the the basic uh,

00:00:14.250-->00:00:19.500
analytics and information that
Google collects when you do
searches and things of that

00:00:19.500-->00:00:24.500
nature. I'll have the slides in
one second here. [mic bump]
Sweet. I will get this playing

00:00:44.167-->00:00:49.167
here. [chuckles] Ah, there we
go. Awesome, now you got some
visuals to go along with it. So,

00:00:55.000-->00:00:59.458
as I said my name is Weston
Hecker. Feel free to follow me
on Twitter. I do a lot uh

00:00:59.458-->00:01:02.750
research during the year and uh
I love helping people with
projects and just security

00:01:02.750-->00:01:06.875
research in general. I'm going
to go into a little bit of
detail we’ll make it a little

00:01:06.875-->00:01:11.542
bit quick here. Um, about
myself, I’m 32, work for NCR
live in North Dakota. Any other

00:01:11.542-->00:01:15.333
North Dakotans? No OK. [laughs]
[audience laughs] There's
probably six of us >>WAHOO >>ah

00:01:15.333-->00:01:20.500
yea, OK There's one or two of
them. Uh, let's look ahead. This
is my fourth year in a row

00:01:20.500-->00:01:25.083
speaking at DEFCON, uh, spoke at
Hope, um, Black Hat last year,
lots of conferences, so I love

00:01:25.083-->00:01:28.125
getting out meeting the
community. That's the reason I
do these talks is to meet people

00:01:28.125-->00:01:32.792
like you guys. So, and I have
been doing uh 12 years pen
testing professionally and uh 13

00:01:32.792-->00:01:38.250
years of research programming.
Things along that and uh, I did
a lot of ATM car hacks, um

00:01:38.250-->00:01:42.083
several IOT projects going on
right now. Uh, reverse
engineering malware things like

00:01:42.083-->00:01:46.792
that. Um, I'm going to be doing
an uh, cool uh, attack on
vehicle the, does anybody have a

00:01:46.792-->00:01:50.333
push button start car? You
should definitely come down to
the car hacking village. I'm

00:01:50.333-->00:01:54.875
going to demo um, uh, how to
stop the relay attacks where
pe..it it's a bas- basically

00:01:54.875-->00:01:59.542
people are using software to
find radios to actually steal
vehicles. So, I'm going to go

00:01:59.542-->00:02:02.125
into how the actual attack
works, then I'm going to go into
uh, some two factor

00:02:02.125-->00:02:05.917
authentication that I added
that's built on a 12 dollar
arduino project. So it's very

00:02:05.917-->00:02:11.583
cool. And uh a little bit about
this research and what led to
it. Uh, so as you can see

00:02:11.583-->00:02:16.500
Microsoft, uh, Window 7, end of
life was all announced and uh, I
mainly use Linux uh like a

00:02:16.500-->00:02:20.417
majority of the people here
probably do, but I am forced uh
to use uh, Windows for some

00:02:20.417-->00:02:25.417
applications and I had a quick
uh, question I called one of my
buddies and I'm sure everybody

00:02:25.417-->00:02:30.125
has that buddy that you call
them for that simple about uh,
um a some pr- uh some concerns

00:02:30.125-->00:02:35.250
and things like that and they'll
uh talk your ear off about
chemtrails for the next hour and

00:02:35.250-->00:02:39.833
a half. So, [laughter]. He's a
very, very paranoid guy. Um,
he's usually right though. Uh,

00:02:39.833-->00:02:43.458
he's uh, added uh validity
several times when I've talked
to him. So, and he's helped with

00:02:43.458-->00:02:49.333
uh tons of my research
especially my uh, cell phone
hacking one I did in uh, DEF CON

00:02:49.333-->00:02:53.542
22. So, which, yeah that's
basically I did as research I
started uh, installing Windows

00:02:53.542-->00:02:59.292
10 in most of my machines. And,
uh, yea. [chuckles] Explains, uh
what systems I've used in the

00:02:59.292-->00:03:03.500
past. Uh how they do in store
tracking operating systems uh
switching to Windows 10 like I

00:03:03.500-->00:03:08.042
was saying which is kind of
scary, scary thought and uh
searching search engines spying

00:03:08.042-->00:03:12.125
uh uh Google. I know they track
all your analytics. Uh Bing
probably does too, but nobody

00:03:12.125-->00:03:17.167
uses it. So [laughter] [laughs]
And I'm going to go into actual
uh billboard spying. Um there's

00:03:17.167-->00:03:23.167
a couple proto type billboards
and I'm pretty sure I fried the
one in Minneapolis in 169. Uh, I

00:03:23.167-->00:03:27.792
was doing some research on it. I
had permission at that time. So,
it's uh something that they want

00:03:27.792-->00:03:32.208
They're actually tracking
vehicle TPMS sensors so tire
pressure monitor sensors and

00:03:32.208-->00:03:37.500
they're profiling people off of
vehicles and the actual
advertisements so and yea, yea

00:03:37.500-->00:03:41.083
that's pretty interesting stuff.
so, um, uh, just privacy is
disappearing so I thought I

00:03:41.083-->00:03:46.375
would do a privacy talk and uh,
yea. Explanation of the targeted
personalized advertising so I'm

00:03:46.375-->00:03:49.833
going to go through a lot of the
advertising um, personalized
ads. Um, they're getting really,

00:03:49.833-->00:03:54.000
really creepy. They got really
creepy for a while there and
then they realized that people

00:03:54.000-->00:03:57.833
were getting creeped out and
they kind of backed them off a
little bit. Um, behav- behavior

00:03:57.833-->00:04:02.792
advertising cookies, um, I'm
going to go into they track you
on, basically, what your

00:04:02.792-->00:04:05.833
hobbies, automotive,
electronics, travel, where
you've been, things like that.

00:04:05.833-->00:04:08.750
Um, collection of non
identifiable information, so
they tell you that it's a lot of

00:04:08.750-->00:04:13.083
it's metadata but there's been
plenty of talks in the past of
how to reverse um, metadata.

00:04:13.083-->00:04:17.167
There was actually some medical
ones where they had people that
had um, diseases and things like

00:04:17.167-->00:04:21.000
that that they were actually to
reverse able to reverse those
two specific people once there

00:04:21.000-->00:04:26.875
was an actual uh breach. So, yea
and uh real time bid information
which is one of the buzz words

00:04:26.875-->00:04:31.500
that's out there so basically
people are buying us like we're
cattle and uh this is basically

00:04:31.500-->00:04:34.833
geared at jacking up every
single analytical they use for
it and making the data

00:04:34.833-->00:04:40.458
completely useless. And, uh, yea
so they have software
advertising displays. Um, uh

00:04:40.458-->00:04:46.958
private marketing um, PMP. Uh,
basically wasting um,
advertiser’s money and yea,

00:04:46.958-->00:04:51.083
there's uh explanation of
technology uh tracking online so
I'm going to go through some of

00:04:51.083-->00:04:57.042
them. I'm gonna explain how deep
and dive in the operating system
are and when you try to uh, uh

00:04:57.042-->00:05:00.625
neuter Windows 10 how it fights
back. [chuckle] because it is a
very, very intrusive operating

00:05:00.625-->00:05:04.750
system. Um, yea it's it's uh
what's to be expected when you
know they are pushing a lot of

00:05:04.750-->00:05:08.125
those updates and stuff like
that. So, how it impacts the
users. How it impacts the

00:05:08.125-->00:05:11.833
business. Um, I know that's
something where I don't mind if
you know they know what my

00:05:11.833-->00:05:15.125
mother's doing on a day to day
basis or I'm sure she doesn't
either, but when it's your

00:05:15.125-->00:05:20.500
actual employees, um, if anybody
is in the sys admin or security
uh admin role and uh it makes a

00:05:20.500-->00:05:24.375
lot of these call in services um
hard to track, especially when
we're trying to see if things

00:05:24.375-->00:05:28.583
are calling out or Trojans or
droppers or any kind of malware
is calling out and stuff like

00:05:28.583-->00:05:32.667
that. It adds a lot of tr-
.unnecessary traffic. And I'm
going to go into GPS tracking.

00:05:32.667-->00:05:37.417
I, uh, off of IP addresses, uh
so on the whole they'll track
what an entire company is doing.

00:05:37.417-->00:05:42.792
If they have one IP address, so.
WIFI Beakuer- uh beacon
information. So how they uh,

00:05:42.792-->00:05:48.875
actually go through cellular
tracking and um, um turn on WIFI
for accuracy. Obviously, uh

00:05:48.875-->00:05:53.083
everybody has their WIFI off
here, but uh, there's you know,
on in the average world when

00:05:53.083-->00:05:56.833
you're walking around the mall
it's amazing to me the
information they collect . And

00:05:56.833-->00:06:00.750
uh, yea, arts, entertainment
this is some of the actual
breakdowns of how ads are

00:06:00.750-->00:06:06.417
personalized and uh sales a bit.
It's very, very boring stuff. I,
I feel, [chuckles] that I don't

00:06:06.417-->00:06:09.583
need to go into much detail on
this and I'm sure I've got a lot
of you guys have have done a lot

00:06:09.583-->00:06:14.375
of research on actually running
ad blockers or black holing
advertisements. Um , I recommend

00:06:14.375-->00:06:18.375
that for everybody, not only
just for security purposes but
even legitimate web pages can

00:06:18.375-->00:06:23.458
have drive by attacks um, there
are several exploit kits that
um, um have had have drive bys

00:06:23.458-->00:06:27.875
in the past on legitimate web
pages, place- pages that I would
visit without any hesitation

00:06:27.875-->00:06:33.792
normally. So, and yea. So there
are some uh good ways to stop
tracking uh right now and I just

00:06:33.792-->00:06:38.083
wanted to uh uh give a plug to
some of these they are all open
source. Uh They're all free. Um,

00:06:38.083-->00:06:43.333
so they have ad blocker apps.
They have um, actual black holes
which basically the advertisers

00:06:43.333-->00:06:48.250
don't know that their ads aren't
being showed, which is a little
more stealthy. Um, Trackmenot is

00:06:48.250-->00:06:54.042
the actual uh hypervisor version
that I wrote as a plug in for
um, uh, the uh actual program at

00:06:54.042-->00:06:58.792
this IO address. It's pretty
amazing it literally crawls the
entire web [chuckles] web page

00:06:58.792-->00:07:03.042
that you send it to and it will
click all the advertisements. In
a safe manner obviously. Uh, but

00:07:03.042-->00:07:06.208
it basically jacks up a lot of
it and I actually added a
hypervisor version because they

00:07:06.208-->00:07:10.750
banned this plugin on Chrome. So
I got it so it's working on
Chrome again and it actually

00:07:10.750-->00:07:15.750
does um uh lots of XML injection
er um a keystroke injection into
the actual browsers themselves

00:07:17.708-->00:07:22.250
so it's something where um it
happens at a later where you're
not going to trigger a lot of

00:07:22.250-->00:07:25.500
the uh, I'm not a robot and a
lot of the security features. So
that is something I'm also

00:07:25.500-->00:07:31.208
releasing open source and it'll
uh, I'll have a working version
for uh VMware, that once it's

00:07:31.208-->00:07:33.833
out of the beta phase here,
everyone will be able to
download it and if as long as

00:07:33.833-->00:07:37.917
you have VMware workstation or
um some of the open source will
also work for it. So the OVAs

00:07:37.917-->00:07:42.417
you'll be able to launch them
and uh, I'll go into a little
bit of uh, other things that I

00:07:42.417-->00:07:46.833
am actually blocking from
Microsoft. So, and uh yea. The
e- uh- Privacy Badger is a

00:07:46.833-->00:07:51.875
really good EFF loves porting
them. Uh, there's paid VPNs uh 4
dollars a month. You can get a

00:07:51.875-->00:07:56.333
decent VPN service. Um some of
the free ones, who knows what
they did. It's uh, [chuckles]

00:07:56.333-->00:08:00.333
probably worse than uh letting
them know your advertising is
some of the stuff that those IP

00:08:00.333-->00:08:03.042
addresses were previously used
for. So that's something that I
would uh definitely recommend

00:08:03.042-->00:08:06.208
that you do your due diligence
when you're checking into that
stuff so. And it's all a very

00:08:06.208-->00:08:11.875
good start um tackling some of
the call homes um doing a uh
actual blocker on the hosts

00:08:11.875-->00:08:16.500
files so it blocks a lot of uh
Microsoft call home type stuff.
Uh, turning off your peer to

00:08:16.500-->00:08:20.958
peer networking um for updates
and stuff like that. So and uh
what do I have against Ads

00:08:20.958-->00:08:26.167
Weston? That's uh that's what my
wife asked me and, uh [chuckle],
yea I know it's something that

00:08:26.167-->00:08:30.542
um I don't mind at all. I hate
having advertisements. Anytime
they offer something like uh, uh

00:08:30.542-->00:08:33.875
youtube red or something like
that where it'll they still
collect a lot of information but

00:08:33.875-->00:08:37.292
it's something where if I don't
have to see an advertisement I
will gladly pay for it. I'm not

00:08:37.292-->00:08:40.958
trying to uh, that's the way
that the internet is free, I
understand that. Um it's all, I

00:08:40.958-->00:08:46.042
will I will gladly pay for a lot
of the uh, uh, premium services
and anything that's ad free and

00:08:46.042-->00:08:51.208
uh even some of the android
stuff it's uh amazing that you
can't actually you know turn off

00:08:51.208-->00:08:55.333
a lot of the tracking and it's
something that, um, as the more
and more they they can snag you

00:08:55.333-->00:08:58.625
with the convenience and then
they add some of the more
intrusive stuff and that's just

00:08:58.625-->00:09:03.500
been happening over uh the last
few years. So, yea and um I'm
going to be able to um, um

00:09:03.500-->00:09:08.458
should go into some yea uh
disable some of the browsing
tracking. They let you know

00:09:08.458-->00:09:12.583
there's cookies. They try to do
all these things to let you know
uh, what they're doing or make

00:09:12.583-->00:09:15.917
you, make them look like they're
more of an accurate and good
demonstration of what they're

00:09:15.917-->00:09:19.417
actually doing but uh in a lot
of cases, um, it it needs a
little bit more intervention and

00:09:19.417-->00:09:23.500
that's why I love that there's
uh tools like on these last page
here that people can actually go

00:09:23.500-->00:09:27.833
out and do this kind of stuff.
So, and yea, so basically drive
by attacks, like I was saying

00:09:27.833-->00:09:33.000
even legitimate web pages um,
uh, there's a lot of them that
even the uh New York Times is

00:09:33.000-->00:09:39.583
one of the bigger ones that
comes to mind. Um, that page
they uh literally send out

00:09:39.583-->00:09:42.583
Twitter saying that their actual
um page is breached, please
don't visit it. So, uh yea that

00:09:42.583-->00:09:45.250
was a drive by I believe it was
a java or a flash drive by
attack. so it was literally just

00:09:45.250-->00:09:48.083
by visiting the page it would uh
actually execute some of the
code on there. so, uh since the

00:09:48.083-->00:09:53.125
late 90's it's been one form or
another in tracking and uh
they're um yea their uh deep

00:09:53.125-->00:10:00.333
diving they're getting their
analytics more tight and uh it's
been used in stores. Uh, the

00:10:00.333-->00:10:04.375
act- actually the brick and
mortars I'm sure everybody in
2012 heard about these you know

00:10:04.375-->00:10:09.042
they're tracking everything and
the stores that were doing it
got a lot of feedback that was

00:10:09.042-->00:10:13.750
negative so they quit doing it
and then they tried it again two
years later, heh and uh they're

00:10:13.750-->00:10:16.958
right back up to the same old
tricks. so that's something
where um, in the in store

00:10:16.958-->00:10:20.875
analytics it's no problem at all
I have no problem at all if
people opt into it, um that's

00:10:20.875-->00:10:26.208
definitely like something if
somebody wants to save 10
percent, 10 cents on their gas

00:10:26.208-->00:10:27.708
or something by all means if
that's something they accept, I
have no problem with at all with

00:10:27.708-->00:10:31.000
that, but it's when um, uh they
actually you know start tracking
cellular beacons of how many

00:10:31.000-->00:10:34.708
customers walk by, their
attention rates, their dwell
times in the store and things

00:10:34.708-->00:10:38.917
like that. I'll actually go into
some heat mapping analytics and
things like that. So, which

00:10:38.917-->00:10:42.333
that's uh, yea I have no problem
at all with opt in programs.
That's one of the biggest

00:10:42.333-->00:10:44.750
things. so they uh track some of
the bluetooth cellular beacons,
uh, wifi, uh, infrared and

00:10:44.750-->00:10:51.750
motion sensors, Um, yea, several
years they began getting
negative press like I said so uh

00:10:51.750-->00:10:56.125
there's been lots of of
resistance on all forms of
tracking. Apple and a couple of

00:10:56.125-->00:10:59.625
other several manufacturers are
doing very, very randomized
beacon information which is

00:10:59.625-->00:11:04.458
awesome to see and uh it's
definitely been a long time
coming for it. So uh, UK and

00:11:04.458-->00:11:08.125
other uh areas in the world been
less resistance from what I've
seen. I know a lot of uh, um.

00:11:08.125-->00:11:13.083
actual tracking that they have
out there is pretty, pretty
readily available. So, I'm told

00:11:13.083-->00:11:17.917
it's been turned into meta data
and I've already explained about
some of the weaknesses in

00:11:17.917-->00:11:22.708
metadata and reversing it and uh
this the 45 dollar device that
uh everyone single one of you

00:11:22.708-->00:11:25.750
should bring and go to the mall
with you every time cause uh,
this actually, uh basically what

00:11:25.750-->00:11:34.458
it is it's a huge uh wireless
beacon generator and it actually
it can generate up to a 150

00:11:34.458-->00:11:42.667
beacons, um and they can be one
of several things. It can either
be, um, so it can either be uh,

00:11:42.667-->00:11:45.708
cellular beacon, so they make it
look like a customer's walking
around they can actually be

00:11:45.708-->00:11:49.125
rogue access points, they can be
pretty much anything you can
generate cellular with a laptop

00:11:49.125-->00:11:54.375
you can now generate with these
and uh I actually have a program
called Groundhog's Day where it

00:11:54.375-->00:11:57.917
replays the exact same days
worth of traffic so it looks
like the same people are walking

00:11:57.917-->00:12:03.125
by and uh, huh huh, it is a
pretty neat neat process and
actually jacks up there uh in

00:12:03.125-->00:12:08.708
store analytics, their retention
rates, all the heat mapping, uh,
cause uh with the more advance

00:12:08.708-->00:12:12.750
version with the actual
Raspberry Pi attached to it, you
can um actually change where

00:12:12.750-->00:12:16.542
people are dwelling in the store
and stuff like that so it's a a
really really cool project and a

00:12:16.542-->00:12:21.833
a that's all going to be open
source on my key lessons I will
release how to actually build

00:12:21.833-->00:12:24.167
one of those. Um, I highly
recommend it. They're pretty fun
uh if you haven't played with

00:12:24.167-->00:12:27.417
wireless before. So [off
microphone statement] Oh, sorry
about that, yea thank you. And

00:12:27.417-->00:12:30.833
um metadata is used to change
the store lay outs. So, say for
example, if uh everybody goes to

00:12:30.833-->00:12:35.167
the front panel they're going to
you know start throwing the more
high price items there things

00:12:35.167-->00:12:38.500
like that. Um, if they realize
everyone is going back to
electronics right away they're

00:12:38.500-->00:12:41.542
going to put a lot of the stuff
to try to sell to people with on
the way there. And more

00:12:41.542-->00:12:45.750
specifically lay lay outs
increase sales and make us more
along the lines of uh just

00:12:45.750-->00:12:51.042
consumers. So, and using regards
programs um yea like I said opt
ins I have no problem with that.

00:12:51.042-->00:12:54.667
Uh I did a little research on
some of the coupons that are
pushed and some of the actual

00:12:54.667-->00:12:58.500
bluetooth tracking. Um, those
things are literally built for
like the year 2023. They're uh

00:12:58.500-->00:13:03.167
not impossible to break but I uh
did not have the time the uh
free time this to year to

00:13:03.167-->00:13:06.375
actually start uh dabbling with
this. Uh, last year I actually
did um some uh ticketed

00:13:06.375-->00:13:10.542
injection but I did the
responsible disclosure with it
so it's something where I

00:13:10.542-->00:13:15.542
wouldn't yea it wouldn't work
anymore so nobody would really
care. Heh, for the majority of

00:13:15.542-->00:13:19.833
it so. So they increase how much
they >>Move the mike closer.
>>Oh, sorry about that. Yea,

00:13:19.833-->00:13:23.333
here we go. And uh yea so
basically they can increase how
much they charge for certain

00:13:23.333-->00:13:28.000
store areas if people have it in
there. So [audience laughing and
clapping] Sorry about that guys.

00:13:28.000-->00:13:31.083
Heh, heh. Yea, thanks for the
brave soul that told me to a
bring it up a little closer so

00:13:31.083-->00:13:35.167
uh. So uh yea it changes the ad
placement in the physical and
the web because they are

00:13:35.167-->00:13:38.833
tracking across platforms. So,
and they have all the collection
on the cellular bluetooth

00:13:38.833-->00:13:45.167
beacons so they're collecting
all DSN information um they have
actual they've weaned away from

00:13:45.167-->00:13:49.375
this one big time because it's
uh very very intrusive and um
some of them have pretty decent

00:13:49.375-->00:13:54.875
ranges on them so um they're not
as um acceptable for as far as
if people are going through

00:13:54.875-->00:13:59.292
actual uh communication with
them. So, and uh how do you
harden the communication best

00:13:59.292-->00:14:02.917
practices? Um, yea that's
something I will be going
through here in a little bit.

00:14:02.917-->00:14:07.792
So, and uh who knows what TPMS
sensors are for vehicles? Yea,
there's been lots of really

00:14:07.792-->00:14:11.625
really cool research. Um, uh so
they have smart billboards. Uh,
they just throw the word smart

00:14:11.625-->00:14:15.458
in front of it and charge people
for it but it something where
gonna basically be tracking

00:14:15.458-->00:14:19.250
beacons. They'll be able to
profile the you know that that
guy driving that 2015 Jeep

00:14:19.250-->00:14:25.500
Cherokee or whatever. They'll be
able to tell that that person's
most likely a white, 32 year old

00:14:25.500-->00:14:29.542
male and they will be able to
answe..uh uh get more of the
advertisements or they'll be

00:14:29.542-->00:14:33.250
able to uh you know generalize
how much they're actually are
able to charge for some of the

00:14:33.250-->00:14:38.250
information, be able to track
people a lot more and uh in the
US uh after 2007 they required

00:14:38.250-->00:14:43.000
it it in a majority of the
vehicles except for special pur
uh purpose built vehicles. Uh so

00:14:43.000-->00:14:49.125
basically it uses unencrypted RF
um 350..um 314 uh majority of it
so depending on the actual

00:14:49.125-->00:14:53.417
vendor. Anytime you go over 19
miles per hour it will do a call
home feature, so and um I'm

00:14:53.417-->00:14:59.125
going to be actually [mouth
sounds] uh demoing the uh in the
car hacking village I have a

00:14:59.125-->00:15:02.333
TPMS sensor where you can
actually add 3 sets of tires to
your vehicle so that's something

00:15:02.333-->00:15:05.917
that Ford owners have not been
able to do without going into a
dealership all the time. So it's

00:15:05.917-->00:15:11.125
something where you can have
your snow tires, racing tires,
but I, and your um whatever you

00:15:11.125-->00:15:13.875
know whatever other kind of tire
other tires you want. Um and
something that um I actually

00:15:13.875-->00:15:18.083
made it so my wife my wife's
vehicle every time it starts up
it will actually generate a new

00:15:18.083-->00:15:23.208
uh TPMS sensor and it will flash
it into her cam bus so it will
it's pretty hard to actually

00:15:23.208-->00:15:27.250
track the vehicle and it's just
one step further uh hopefully
people will adopt those kind of

00:15:27.250-->00:15:30.167
things uh once they start
tracking more of that beacon
information. So, and uh

00:15:30.167-->00:15:34.083
yeah, that right now that's one
of majorities that they're
actually testing and I'll be

00:15:34.083-->00:15:42.875
doing the demo of that on an
actual car hacking village. So
yea and everybody's for the most

00:15:42.875-->00:15:44.708
part I don't need to go into
social media. Uh, that is
literally just that is pretty

00:15:44.708-->00:15:47.000
much nothing but data
collection. Um, there's been
several jokes. I love one of the

00:15:47.000-->00:15:51.833
Onion ads where they had Mark
Zuckerberg is like an FBI agent
and it's uh heh heh yea they got

00:15:51.833-->00:15:55.167
some pretty accurate stuff like
that and it's uh abused in the
past um it's just they're

00:15:55.167-->00:15:58.333
literally just tracking
everything on it and it's it's
something that we that they

00:15:58.333-->00:16:01.958
willingly accept to be able to
uh you know send cat memes and
things like that to each other.

00:16:01.958-->00:16:06.000
So, and uh, reversing the
randomness so when I went
through an actual pages it was

00:16:06.000-->00:16:10.417
pretty simple. I uh start with a
dummy account on a VPS and it
would start searching a specific

00:16:10.417-->00:16:15.792
dialogues um of things that I
would think that people's
personalities. I would think of

00:16:15.792-->00:16:19.375
a friend and then I would think
of things that they would search
and I would think of that age

00:16:19.375-->00:16:22.333
right now. I would think of my
niece and things she would
search. What my cousin would

00:16:22.333-->00:16:25.583
search. What my uncle would
search. A lot of that stuff, so
that's something that where I

00:16:25.583-->00:16:29.250
was kind of looking at what they
were reversing and what they
were advertising with. So I

00:16:29.250-->00:16:32.375
built out a huge uh spread sheet
that is actually gonna be
something else I'll also be

00:16:32.375-->00:16:37.333
releasing with these tools. Um
and it basically shows that what
what what you're profile and how

00:16:37.333-->00:16:40.958
to build a profile cause that's
actually what the uh program
that I made is you can set

00:16:40.958-->00:16:44.667
yourself to say for example the
example I was giving was a 12
year old girl who likes horses

00:16:44.667-->00:16:50.458
and uh you you'll be looking at
how to flash um a firmware on it
ubertooth one and the next thing

00:16:50.458-->00:16:54.292
you know she your searching if
does he like me you know where
are the best horse ranches.

00:16:54.292-->00:16:58.542
Things like that. so, You will
be able to throw in some pretty
random details and it's actually

00:16:58.542-->00:17:03.667
a plug in for uh that amazing
program that I was talking about
earlier um they they do a very,

00:17:03.667-->00:17:06.917
very good job at random stuff,
but uh some of the random stuff
that you gets thrown into

00:17:06.917-->00:17:12.042
unlogical bins where they don't
even get advertise to or they
get very very low resale. So

00:17:12.042-->00:17:16.375
these actually keep you looking
like a real person on the web uh
because eventually when enough

00:17:16.375-->00:17:20.208
people start using blocking
services like that they're going
to start actually deep diving

00:17:20.208-->00:17:24.292
into a little bit more into the
actual uh details and the
software of it. So, and yea back

00:17:24.292-->00:17:29.750
into the old XPDs uh they really
didn't store store much
information. Huh, huh. and uh

00:17:29.750-->00:17:36.750
yea 1984 style moving into
Windows it's literally amazing
the uh amount of information

00:17:36.750-->00:17:40.083
they collect and I have been a
huge fan of uh doing
misinformation type talks like

00:17:40.083-->00:17:43.708
the the one that I actually did
was um uh injecting fake credit
card numbers for credit card

00:17:43.708-->00:17:50.542
skimming software. So, like it's
like it's all about like if I
can't have my data, nobody can

00:17:50.542-->00:17:52.417
kind of situation. So, it's like
it becomes so useless they won't
actually want it anymore and

00:17:52.417-->00:17:57.500
that's kind of the thought in
the process behind it. And, yea.
An explanation of attacks so

00:17:57.500-->00:18:00.708
blocking the billboard spying um
I'm going to go through that
with a TPMS sensor and uh

00:18:00.708-->00:18:03.792
explaining the actual main
attack surface of the past
several monitoring systems. So

00:18:03.792-->00:18:07.167
how brick and mortar stores are
spying on people and how web and
OS are spying on people, so that

00:18:07.167-->00:18:12.417
will be the next phase of this.
And uh some methods of stopping
some billboard spying. Since

00:18:12.417-->00:18:16.625
billboards there >>Louder! >>Oh,
they're picking up uh this, this
microphone. I apologize really

00:18:16.625-->00:18:20.583
here. So, [laughs] so, smart
billboards they capture the
wireless sensor information. Uh,

00:18:20.583-->00:18:26.333
they capture all but based on
the model year of the car, the
age range, income range. Uh, if

00:18:26.333-->00:18:29.917
you're if you're driving a brand
new Lexus you're most likely not
a McDonald's employee and they

00:18:29.917-->00:18:34.125
like to profile it like that and
that that's just one more of the
things where it dehumanizes a

00:18:34.125-->00:18:39.458
lot of the information. So, and
uh passive and opt in programs
once again like I said uh people

00:18:39.458-->00:18:43.833
have a lot of applications for
tracking through a lot of the
extra moldings uh uh public

00:18:43.833-->00:18:50.458
transit systems and stuff like
that so and like I was saying uh
you can add um a lot of the not

00:18:50.458-->00:18:53.417
not necessity of having to go
into a dealership which is
really really nice because um uh

00:18:53.417-->00:18:57.542
Ford and Lincoln vehicles is the
one that have the tool that I'm
working for now and it's nice to

00:18:57.542-->00:19:02.458
actually be able to install um
uh like a Groundhogs Day type of
situation, so you cycle through.

00:19:02.458-->00:19:07.167
The one that I have that would
be more practical is adding a 10
tire TPMS sensors and cycling

00:19:07.167-->00:19:11.167
through them. Uh so that's
something where it's not
randomly generating them uh

00:19:11.167-->00:19:15.667
because that is a bit more of a
lengthy process especially um uh
once a week you actually have to

00:19:15.667-->00:19:21.083
do a hard flash uh to actually
add some of your TPMS sensors.
So, and yea, so what's being

00:19:21.083-->00:19:24.667
collected and then what allow
them to uh profile me online
that was one of the the biggest

00:19:24.667-->00:19:28.167
things that was uh the
collection of the information
once I logged it all uh it's

00:19:28.167-->00:19:33.000
something that was it was pretty
interesting. Um, what slight
changes would uh change in

00:19:33.000-->00:19:35.708
advertisements and things along
those natures especially when
it's starting to getting into

00:19:35.708-->00:19:39.792
getting into higher profile
travel um you can also see where
people are spending a lot of the

00:19:39.792-->00:19:43.792
money, uh, for actual click to
pay advertisements and stuff
like that. So, uh, how do they

00:19:43.792-->00:19:47.833
use it? Uh, who who is it
interested to? Who's buying it?
Uh, how is the information held

00:19:47.833-->00:19:52.708
against people. They've uh done
there's actual FBI portals uh
and things like that for you

00:19:52.708-->00:19:56.583
know a lot of this information
so they don't have to actually
submit warrant er, they have to

00:19:56.583-->00:19:59.375
do warrants and everything like
that they have to do the the due
process. It's just something

00:19:59.375-->00:20:04.625
that they actually have to uh
yea they have to keep it up so.
And how's that yea all the

00:20:04.625-->00:20:08.750
information for portals for law
enforcement uh one of the
biggest ones I have known is the

00:20:08.750-->00:20:16.542
the ones for an actual cellular
communications. So, and yea, um.
So basically injecting the pulse

00:20:16.542-->00:20:19.917
data, uh, changing your profile
um how much information do you
have to do to combat your years

00:20:19.917-->00:20:25.042
of of profiling. Um, one of the
biggest things I did a couple of
years ago was I started like 3

00:20:25.042-->00:20:28.958
Google accounts and then I
switched in between them. Didn't
even trick them because of a lot

00:20:28.958-->00:20:32.708
of the information that they
picked up they still profiled it
as the same person. Um so I'm

00:20:32.708-->00:20:36.208
going to go into a little bit of
the profiling changing and
actually throwing off some of

00:20:36.208-->00:20:41.750
the lower level analytics and uh
who knows what type fisting is?
Huh, huh. Yea it's uh like a

00:20:41.750-->00:20:45.958
World War 2 based on when people
did the tap the actual morse
code and stuff like that It's

00:20:45.958-->00:20:50.250
something where they would have
been able to tell where somebody
was in Germany based on the

00:20:50.250-->00:20:53.875
actual way that they typed their
information and that's one of
the actual analytics set up that

00:20:53.875-->00:20:56.458
uh that Windows 10 is collecting
so that's part of that
hypervisor that I built is it

00:20:56.458-->00:21:00.583
actually collects your all of
your keystrokes and actually
injects them out and into the

00:21:00.583-->00:21:05.458
operating system or whatever
your selected tab is and uh in
for and um 38 you can select the

00:21:05.458-->00:21:08.417
stroke per minute depending on
how fast you type but it
basically pops it out so there's

00:21:08.417-->00:21:12.083
no type fist so it can't tell if
it's you using your computer or
your wife using your computer

00:21:12.083-->00:21:16.500
and uh there's a couple other uh
ways that you could do a lot of
this stuff um it can be used for

00:21:16.500-->00:21:21.375
injection of typing um you can
do um I'm working on mouse click
uh emulation and simulation

00:21:21.375-->00:21:25.042
that's undetectable and things
like that, so, it will be a a
pretty decent project once it's

00:21:25.042-->00:21:29.417
uh plea..complete so and then
we're going to go through
through the browser bot and uh

00:21:29.417-->00:21:33.333
how to not get det..detected by
search engines and web browser
programs that was one of the

00:21:33.333-->00:21:37.792
biggest things uh right away it
was uh kept busting me and it
just was a little disheartening

00:21:37.792-->00:21:41.833
at first so but yea uh so yea. A
lot of the r..um, I'm not a
robot uh who who saw that

00:21:41.833-->00:21:49.375
originally they got like how
hard can that be to beat, then
they try to beat it. Huh, yea

00:21:49.375-->00:21:54.583
it's actually huh a pretty well
thought out process um uh so a
lot of the it's not just about

00:21:54.583-->00:21:57.250
the clicking it's about the
naturalness of how it is clicked
so that's something that we're

00:21:57.250-->00:22:02.750
um if you're able to push mouse
clicks from a hyper visor um
it's a lot more uh accurate in

00:22:02.750-->00:22:06.375
detail and you can tune it a lot
better and it also makes it so
that everybody can use it you

00:22:06.375-->00:22:10.208
don't have to have low level
details of actually how to um
program a lot of the stuff so

00:22:10.208-->00:22:15.958
and yea and so yea you can
basically um go through the joys
of watching your advertisements

00:22:15.958-->00:22:21.000
change first hand. You can throw
off your analytics a little bit
and um based on your actual

00:22:21.000-->00:22:25.125
advertisements you can reverse
that to what they profile you as
and as that that's actually

00:22:25.125-->00:22:28.958
pretty creepy uh based on the
actual data based information
you can actually see that they

00:22:28.958-->00:22:33.125
know that you're, you know, in
your mid 30's and you love
vehicles and computers or

00:22:33.125-->00:22:37.958
whatever your ser..uh things
are. So there's ways to actually
go uh the reversing process it's

00:22:37.958-->00:22:42.042
uh it's a pretty decent process
if you guys haven't ever mapped
anything out like this, um

00:22:42.042-->00:22:45.667
search engines are really really
easy to do and it's uh
definitely something if you're

00:22:45.667-->00:22:49.125
wanting to get into a data
project with some of your
friends. So, and yea, basically

00:22:49.125-->00:22:53.542
uh yea. This mal ware can
actually be used to uh do bad
things. So you could actually uh

00:22:53.542-->00:22:57.917
like a hypervisor like that I
was looking at that where
somebody could actually use it

00:22:57.917-->00:23:00.875
as frameware. They could make
people visit bad web pages
things like that so that's one

00:23:00.875-->00:23:05.667
more reason that you're going to
want to integrate something that
will keep track of what your

00:23:05.667-->00:23:09.292
actual analytics are and what
it's actually conveying and you
can actually frame somebody uh

00:23:09.292-->00:23:14.458
it could basically damage
somebody's life or even worse it
could like Nickelback on

00:23:14.458-->00:23:18.167
Facebook. So, [audience
laughing] Huh, huh, I just had
to bash on Nickelback because

00:23:18.167-->00:23:23.750
they are the worse worse thing
to come. but yea, and uh there's
basically a um yea yea it's also

00:23:23.750-->00:23:27.375
used um if you want to do some
testing for malware a lot of the
mal ware looks to see if the

00:23:27.375-->00:23:32.833
virtual machine is used and it's
something where you can get some
actual um real real world case

00:23:32.833-->00:23:37.250
usage um I know it's something
uh without paying you know
50-->000 dollars for their uh

00:23:37.250-->00:23:40.958
really expensive BMs that are
specifically for bursting mal
ware it's something you could

00:23:40.958-->00:23:45.083
make virtual machines look like
they have daily usage in them.
So it's something where you want

00:23:45.083-->00:23:48.042
to kick a payload off or where
it kicks off 3 weeks later or
something you would actually be

00:23:48.042-->00:23:52.542
able to do a bit more research
on it, so, and yea basically
it's the operating systems and a

00:23:52.542-->00:23:58.208
yea. So how I tried to make
Windows 10 uh go off the grid,
kind of, uh was basically by you

00:23:58.208-->00:24:02.833
know redoing some of the hosts
seeing what it's calling out to
Um, others have done that in the

00:24:02.833-->00:24:07.375
past others have failed um I
failed the first few times I did
it um there's actually very good

00:24:07.375-->00:24:11.125
tools um out there for blocking
a lot of days they get turned
right back on as soon as you run

00:24:11.125-->00:24:15.042
an update though so that's
something where uh I'll be
posting some of that research

00:24:15.042-->00:24:20.417
and a little bit more about uh
deep dive into the operations
systems of uh cause I'm sure a

00:24:20.417-->00:24:23.667
lot of you guys are adopting
either for your actual users or
for your actual self uh

00:24:23.667-->00:24:27.417
switching over to Windows 10
from Windows 7 and uh actually
injecting from the hypervisor

00:24:27.417-->00:24:33.792
and how much information the
actual uh OS detects before like
a lot of the um errors and

00:24:33.792-->00:24:39.917
issues and things like that will
actually submit those um and
there's uh pretty much anything

00:24:39.917-->00:24:44.042
that was getting sent home to
Microsoft I have made a way to
send them bulls**t. so it was a

00:24:44.042-->00:24:48.917
pretty fun fun it was a fun
project and it was uh I love
watching actual responses of it

00:24:48.917-->00:24:53.250
so and uh yea. IP version 6 and
how it changes spying on us uh
some of the real time

00:24:53.250-->00:24:58.917
communication um that is uh yea
some of it for as far as it like
breaking um anonymity on the web

00:24:58.917-->00:25:03.458
there's lots of actual
information out there for it so
yea screen sizer uh screen

00:25:03.458-->00:25:06.375
sizing and browser information
that was uh one of my bigger
breakthroughs when I was um

00:25:06.375-->00:25:11.292
going through how they were
actually uh tracking a lot of uh
uh um um details from some of

00:25:11.292-->00:25:15.792
the posts and get requests and
things like that so and uh type
fisting is something that um yea

00:25:15.792-->00:25:22.083
it's basically uh something
Windows 10 they've been uh
collecting I don't see any

00:25:22.083-->00:25:26.208
reason that they would need to
do that uh aside from per user
basis. Um there's some pretty

00:25:26.208-->00:25:30.583
cool uh research on people like
being able lock machines if they
feel that somebody else is

00:25:30.583-->00:25:34.458
typing at the machine or
something like that uh so I've
seen a couple of programs like

00:25:34.458-->00:25:39.667
that and a type fisting app
would be able to be a pen
testing tool for something like

00:25:39.667-->00:25:46.708
that but but yea no so we do the
XML and HTML injection uh yea
and it's basically a macro based

00:25:46.708-->00:25:51.125
injection so um I add the most
simple simple version of it is
ghost writer if you want it to 

00:25:51.125-->00:25:55.917
literally inject things out of
uh uh text file you can do that.
Um you can use some of the plug

00:25:55.917-->00:26:00.375
ins for some of the other
applications that are out there
and uh yea there's like I said

00:26:00.375-->00:26:04.750
it interacts with other programs
by um if they're brought to
front or if they're a select a window

00:26:04.750-->00:26:09.458
and you can change a lot of the
functionality with that um there
are some CV plugins that people

00:26:09.458-->00:26:15.083
have um for desktop support uh
applications and I'll also be
posting and referencing to so um

00:26:15.083-->00:26:19.708
and can Windows stop this and
it's easy to use so it something
that um I have not seen um

00:26:19.708-->00:26:25.958
Microsoft combat any of the uh
actual anti type fisting or any
of the hyper visor inner

00:26:25.958-->00:26:31.000
intervention. That's something
that where it also does a lot of
really really cool stuff like

00:26:31.000-->00:26:35.833
blocking um some of the hid
attacks like human interbase
stuff like device attacks it

00:26:35.833-->00:26:39.250
blocks like some of the bash
bunny attacks uh because it
basically hijacks any input um

00:26:39.250-->00:26:44.667
quite literally any input unless
it's uh uh pre detected device
so and you can uh also have it

00:26:44.667-->00:26:49.292
released so it's a very very
cool concept and yea I'm excited
to see people's feedback on it

00:26:49.292-->00:26:53.875
and yea be able to grow it and
see what other people do and
maybe other people can clean up

00:26:53.875-->00:26:58.000
the code. There's a lot better
programmers out there than me so
and yea basically blocking out

00:26:58.000-->00:27:01.792
the outputs from your phone
there's a couple programs out
there that um uh are pretty nice

00:27:01.792-->00:27:05.792
that you don't have to actually
rip you phone which is amazing
because I know several years ago

00:27:05.792-->00:27:09.292
if you wanted to delete uh the
foot like the like I know there
are some guys that are computer

00:27:09.292-->00:27:13.875
guys and football guys but I
have no interest at all in the
NFL or Nascar or some of that

00:27:13.875-->00:27:16.750
other stuff they have loaded
onto my phones and it's just
nice to have be able to have uh

00:27:16.750-->00:27:21.958
yea uh basically it frees ways
to get rid of all that
information so and um yea so you

00:27:21.958-->00:27:27.792
can generate um also there's um
a lot of applications that will
read 50 SMS messages a day or

00:27:27.792-->00:27:33.333
they'll read 50 emails and uh
they have their end user license
agreement or EUA 50 uh where

00:27:33.333-->00:27:37.083
they have the they basically
read your emails so they can
better tailor uh either your

00:27:37.083-->00:27:41.875
typing or your auto completion.
They'll give you a lot of
examples like that but it's uh

00:27:41.875-->00:27:48.417
most likely for other uses so
yea and airplane mode um working
on making uh I have an HGC1 or

00:27:48.417-->00:27:55.708
HGC 10 now and I I did a PRL
hack so it actually doesn't
attach to uh fake uh fake cell

00:27:55.708-->00:27:59.958
phone towers. and also I'm
having a DEFCON mode and I'm
sure a couple of other people

00:27:59.958-->00:28:03.292
have the switch on the side of
their laptop that they used as
DEFCON mode before but yea

00:28:03.292-->00:28:07.208
basically it turns off your
radios does not allow you to uh
turn off your radios it reminds

00:28:07.208-->00:28:11.583
you a week before to change all
your one time passwords call in
information so and yea I'm going

00:28:11.583-->00:28:14.625
to go over the actual hardware
that I'm going to be demoing
here in a second and uh this is

00:28:14.625-->00:28:18.250
actual look into the in store
tracking systems. So heat
mapping so they track how many

00:28:18.250-->00:28:22.500
people walk by the store and
they see how many people
actually walk into the store.

00:28:22.500-->00:28:27.292
where the people actually dwell.
Um so this device actually I
just ordered as many radio 8 O 2

00:28:27.292-->00:28:32.125
11 compliant things as I could
and started slapping them on an
arduino and it's a pretty fun

00:28:32.125-->00:28:36.250
project I definately recommend
you build them you can build
them for around 35 to 45 dollars

00:28:36.250-->00:28:43.750
and uh it basically um..uh
there's a collection mode where
you can collect the beacon's

00:28:43.750-->00:28:47.667
like I was saying for a
Groundhog's Day type attack or
you can actually ee edit your

00:28:47.667-->00:28:51.542
own text files and then you can
pop in your own beacon
information so you can basically

00:28:51.542-->00:28:56.167
have it look like hundreds and
you know if you built one bigger
than this or you actually got a

00:28:56.167-->00:29:00.000
full blown boards on these ones
you could actually build it out
to the point where you could

00:29:00.000-->00:29:06.167
have uh 3 to 400 access points
so or beacons or whatever those
things and uh heat mapping. Uh

00:29:06.167-->00:29:10.583
so there's an actual threshold
um so there's basically they
attract people there’s classic

00:29:10.583-->00:29:15.208
people tracking awesome OK yes
there's classic people tracking
and it's going to go through um

00:29:15.208-->00:29:19.458
you know actual infrared. It
will count a ticker it's
literally just as if somebody is

00:29:19.458-->00:29:23.333
uh tripping an I beam. So I
actually built an infrared
blocker for that. A heat mapping

00:29:23.333-->00:29:27.583
my actual application when you
hook it up to Raspberry Pi you
can make it look like people are

00:29:27.583-->00:29:31.542
walking in a circle in a store
and it is really really creepy I
couldn't use the actual software

00:29:31.542-->00:29:36.708
uh because I would most likely
get sued or at least get a cease
and desist letter uh but yea

00:29:36.708-->00:29:40.292
it's uh pretty interesting stuff
there's um uh older software
that is really really fun to see

00:29:40.292-->00:29:45.625
the reactions of it so and yea.
I'm going to be uh er..the
actual device that's going

00:29:45.625-->00:29:51.125
through here so you can ba..
basically um look at the strange
responses from the uh uh the

00:29:51.125-->00:29:54.792
actual system and it will uh do
some of the uh re-beaconing and
some of the other device

00:29:54.792-->00:29:59.542
reactions so and this is the
actual radio that we're going to
be demoing here and yea this is

00:29:59.542-->00:30:04.917
a CB based so yea they basically
uh you peel the threshold with a
really really high powered

00:30:04.917-->00:30:09.708
infrared laser uh you can
basically um yea. It basically
makes all the uh actual

00:30:09.708-->00:30:15.750
analytics shut down um so after
about an hour of this um it had
useless data after 3 hours it

00:30:15.750-->00:30:21.125
literally made the entire store
black like that . [laughs] and
it yea it was pretty decent so

00:30:21.125-->00:30:25.292
but yea I'm going to go into the
actual demo here um yeah I'm
going to actually let it uh lay

00:30:25.292-->00:30:33.625
waste to the actual um software
find radio or I got a actual
capture of of the wireless

00:30:33.625-->00:30:37.125
packets so I'm going to go
through that here in a second so
I'm going to go into the actual

00:30:37.125-->00:30:41.417
demonstration and then uh yea.
I'm going to do the Groundhog's
Day attack and then I'm going to

00:30:41.417-->00:30:45.167
do the dwelling time attack so
it's going to jack up all the
dwelling time and um on this

00:30:45.167-->00:30:49.500
computer here I will show uh
while I'm getting this demo
setup I will actually show you

00:30:49.500-->00:30:53.458
uh, which is not that
interesting of a demo, but uh I
will do that while I actually

00:30:53.458-->00:30:56.708
set up the software finding
radio demo so uh and yea. I
would just like to give thanks

00:30:56.708-->00:31:02.208
to my work, um my kids, my wife
who’s very very patient with me,
uh Jesus, my Uncle Staci for

00:31:02.208-->00:31:06.917
giving me my first Zenith easy
PC, um DEF CON for having me
speak for the fourth year in a

00:31:06.917-->00:31:10.667
row. It's an honor and uh
audience for listening to me and
especially when I have to bobble

00:31:10.667-->00:31:14.083
a microphone in front of me. I
have to I apologize for that and
I can't wait to hear the trolls

00:31:14.083-->00:31:18.000
on youtube on that one so..
[laughing] huh,huh hey they
already said I sound like Beavis

00:31:18.000-->00:31:21.500
and Butthead on my last talk
because I have nervous stuff
that comes out but yea follow me

00:31:21.500-->00:31:26.000
on twitter guys and uh
definitely uh thanks again
audience it’s uh you guys are

00:31:26.000-->00:31:29.708
what make DEF CON and I really
do mean that so and yea I’m
going to kick off the demo here

00:31:29.708-->00:31:47.125
so [silence] so here we go, oop
[microphone sound] let's get
this here yea so this one

00:31:47.125-->00:31:52.875
basically is uh uh one of the
text implementations of the
actual uh Word profile so this

00:31:52.875-->00:32:01.000
one is a plugin for uh this
application here which basically
uh it will go through and

00:32:01.000-->00:32:05.583
literally troll all the pages. I
did not write this program it's
something that uh I um am a huge

00:32:05.583-->00:32:08.000
fan of supporting and I
definitely want to plug it on
something where it literally

00:32:08.000-->00:32:12.000
goes through and clicks on all
the advertisements. Um they used
a randomness that was something

00:32:12.000-->00:32:16.583
that I saw as a a eventual
weakness, but it's something
where um you can now actually

00:32:16.583-->00:32:24.417
load your own profile in there
and um you can build um sur
channel on actual uh yea so

00:32:24.417-->00:32:31.708
that's basically gonna go
through here what it actually
will track here. Let's see. Yea

00:32:31.708-->00:32:35.917
so you can go through all the
settings it's an amazing tool
and it's uh very very easy um to

00:32:35.917-->00:32:39.125
actually modify if you guys
wanted to start injecting your
own profile information. I'm

00:32:39.125-->00:33:01.208
going to be releasing the actual
app for that here soon so. Let's
see. Yea I'm going to be

00:33:01.208-->00:33:05.417
powering up my radio here and uh
yea. I’m going to get my Cali
machine going so one second

00:33:05.417-->00:33:40.542
[microphone sound] here we go.
So I’m just going to get airomon
running here in a second Here's

00:33:40.542-->00:34:14.042
what an idle DEFCON looks like.
Here we go. [off-mic comments]
>>OK If you guys want to open up

00:34:14.042-->00:35:02.333
to questions too feel free to
approach the microphone
[coughing] [tapping sounds] Come

00:35:02.333-->00:35:10.750
on There we go and we of course
my screen jacks up but I can't
actually see it

00:35:10.750-->00:35:14.083
here. Yea we should have uh
SSIDs start popping up and uh
there's going to be tons of

00:35:14.083-->00:35:19.375
actual beacon information going
out right now so so basically
this is making uh like I was

00:35:19.375-->00:35:23.375
saying there's the Grounddog's
Groundhog's Day scenario where
basically it replays the same

00:35:23.375-->00:35:25.917
day so you can actually capture
information that’s why it
actually has two radios on there

00:35:25.917-->00:35:30.292
uh that are full blown uh dab
boards for radios then the
actual other smaller antennas

00:35:30.292-->00:35:34.500
get passed off to a delay where
they will pop the beacon
information that was passed off

00:35:34.500-->00:35:39.417
from the initial radio and uh
like I said I will be releasing
the actual code for this so and

00:35:39.417-->00:35:45.208
I'm glad my demo didn't blow up
and you should see a couple of
fake access points popping up

00:35:45.208-->00:35:49.667
here and uh there's tons of
beacon information if any of you
guys have uh scanner on hand so

00:35:49.667-->00:35:54.958

they keep it appropriate

00:36:01.417-->00:36:05.750

booted up I should have known
people were going to mess with

00:36:05.750-->00:36:10.083
it, but, [laughs], [audience

good in stores cause when you

00:36:10.083-->00:36:13.875

waiting with a laptop booted up
