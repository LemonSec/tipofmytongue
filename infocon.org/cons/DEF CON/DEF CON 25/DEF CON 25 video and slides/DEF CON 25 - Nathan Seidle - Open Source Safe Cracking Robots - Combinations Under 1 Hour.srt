00:00:00.042-->00:00:04.708
>>Hello everyone, um thank you
very much for coming to this
talk. Uh, we're going to attempt

00:00:04.708-->00:00:09.708
to crack this safe in the next
45 minutes. We could have made
this safe cracker faster but

00:00:09.708-->00:00:14.125
then how would we get a 45
minute time slot [laughter] so
we're going to do the best we

00:00:14.125-->00:00:18.417
can. These guys are still
setting up as you can see it's
kind of uh a big set up but um,

00:00:18.417-->00:00:22.542
we're going to go through the
technical aspects of how we
built it. I am Nathan, this is

00:00:22.542-->00:00:24.542
Joel and that's Rob. [laughter]
So a little background, um if
you uh may or may not know a

00:00:24.542-->00:00:29.833
company called SparkFun
Electronics so back 15 years ago
in 2002, I started SparkFun

00:00:29.833-->00:00:35.875
Electronics in a little room,
hopefully you can see it uh this
was in student housing and there

00:00:35.875-->00:00:40.875
was like 15 of us in this house
and I started shipping little
electronics out of my bedroom

00:00:44.125-->00:00:50.333
freaking out my roommates. Uh
and um, here we are today pretty
advanced website. We have about

00:00:50.333-->00:00:57.208
2-->000 products that we sell, uh
about 500 of those are open
source hardware. So today um,

00:00:57.208-->00:01:01.958
what SparkFun does is we design
little development boards and
technology and then we build

00:01:01.958-->00:01:06.167
projects using that technology
to demonstrate it and inspire
other folks. So this is an

00:01:06.167-->00:01:11.583
example of uh a light R with an
Arduino shield and uh 7 uh
couple 7 segment displays and

00:01:11.583-->00:01:17.583
you can see um if you have
distance >>[audience babble]
Slide! [indiscernible] Slide! >>

00:01:17.583-->00:01:22.583
No slides? >>You don't have
slides you'll have to do an
interpretive dance >>[laughs]

00:01:25.292-->00:01:30.292
Going to do an interpretive
dance for all the slides.
[off-mic inaudible chatter]

00:01:40.250-->00:01:45.250
[laugh] [faint squeaking] >>Tell
us a story! >>Another shot!
[laughter] >>He can't move, he

00:02:03.833-->00:02:10.125
can't move! [laughter]
[squeaking continues] So I don't
know if you can hear that noise,

00:02:10.125-->00:02:15.125
but I still have nightmares with
that noise. We've been working
on this a lot uh but I'll wave

00:02:17.625-->00:02:23.458
my hands. So uh what the robot
is doing as you can see um, if
you can see there's a dial on

00:02:23.458-->00:02:30.292
the front and there's uh a servo
pulling on the handle. So while
um we set up here um we attach

00:02:30.292-->00:02:35.000
the robot using magnets so the
idea is that uh it's- there's no
glue, there's no drilling,

00:02:35.000-->00:02:40.000
there's nothing to make it so
that um you would if we did it
right [applause] okay. We got

00:02:46.000-->00:02:50.250
slides, um I don't know if we're
going to have this video feed up
but um hopefully they'll work on

00:02:50.250-->00:02:53.458
that. In the meantime I'm going
to stream through this thing.
I'm Nathan, that's Joel, that's

00:02:53.458-->00:02:58.125
Rob. Uh this is what SparkFun
looked like 15 years ago,
student housing uh 15 people in

00:02:58.125-->00:03:02.000
this house uh this is what our
website looks like, cool. Um
this is [laugh] we build

00:03:02.000-->00:03:06.708
technology, this is a light R
with a couple 7 segments
displays and you have distance

00:03:06.708-->00:03:11.375
out to about 40 feet right? So
if you take multiple
measurements um per second than

00:03:11.375-->00:03:16.250
you can turn that into speed. So
this is a speed trap, you run at
the wall and see how fast you

00:03:16.250-->00:03:20.083
can get that number up to.
[laughter] and in the lower
right hand corner you can see

00:03:20.083-->00:03:25.625
the handprint um we're lucky no
one's cracked the drywall yet.
Um this is uh another thing I

00:03:25.625-->00:03:30.500
built a speedbag detectors so
you hit the speedbag and
vibrations from the platform

00:03:30.500-->00:03:35.042
using an accelerometer you can
count the number of speedbag
hits. That helped me train for

00:03:35.042-->00:03:39.333
an amateur boxing match. I am
undefeated 1 and 0 amateur
boxer. [applause] A Beehive we

00:03:39.333-->00:03:43.083
hacked. So we took a bathroom
scale, hacked it, attached it to
wifi and you can see the weight

00:03:43.083-->00:03:47.792
of the beehive change overtime.
It's actually sawtooth cause
every morning 5 pounds of bees

00:03:47.792-->00:03:52.792
leave the hive and they come
back during the day and then
they leave again. Kinda

00:03:56.458-->00:04:01.042
interesting. Um power-power
wheels, my wife and I. Who is my
beautiful wife like to hack

00:04:01.042-->00:04:06.667
things. So we hacked power
wheels um up to about 48 volts
uh a bunch of sensors. Uh laser

00:04:06.667-->00:04:10.792
distance sensors uh it's an
autonomous power wheels that
does about 18 miles an hour.

00:04:13.583-->00:04:19.000
[laughter] This is all to say
I'm a hardware geek. I don't
know software. My wife had to

00:04:19.000-->00:04:24.000
explain this cartoon to me.
[laughter] I'm sorry. Then she
asked me for a sandwich. Okay

00:04:28.083-->00:04:33.167
[laughter] You're all here today
to figure out how to make these
look like this. Now the story

00:04:33.167-->00:04:39.708
behind this thing is uh, I'm
really into puzzles and my wife
found a safe on craigslist for

00:04:39.708-->00:04:45.250
20 dollars. It was so cheap
because the owner of that safe
did not have the combination,

00:04:45.250-->00:04:49.500
they had lost it. You can hire a
locksmith to open it up for you
but the owner was just like oh

00:04:49.500-->00:04:52.458
forget it, I'm just going to
kick it to craigslist so my wife
bought it and gave it to me for

00:04:52.458-->00:04:57.458
Christmas and I said hey we got
to build robot to open this
thing up. [laughter] and we,

00:05:00.542-->00:05:07.083
okay we're doing good. Alright,
um and then uh we build it, uh
we live streamed it on you uh

00:05:07.083-->00:05:11.792
youtube which was the second
dumbest thing I've dom- I've
done in my life. The dumbest

00:05:11.792-->00:05:18.625
thing I've done in my life is
demoed Def Con. [laughter] So
we've opened this safe in 41

00:05:18.625-->00:05:24.167
minutes. Okay now this safe is
really cool um but I'm going to
give you a little animation

00:05:24.167-->00:05:29.167
about how safe combination locks
work. A little background there
we go. Okay, there is 3 disks.

00:05:33.500-->00:05:38.500
The A disk, B disk and C disk.
hmmm, hmmm, [humming under
breath] there we go, lovely

00:05:53.417-->00:05:58.625
alright. So the C disk is that
blue one that's got the notches
in it, the green disk is disk B,

00:05:58.625-->00:06:03.875
disk A now the first thing you
need to know is disk C is
directly attached to the dial so

00:06:03.875-->00:06:09.667
when you twist that dial you're
only turning disk C. Now after
awhile disk C has these dots on

00:06:09.667-->00:06:15.542
it and those dots will interfere
with the dots on disk B. And so
that's how you turn disk B.

00:06:15.542-->00:06:21.667
Continuing to turn, you turn
disk A. You line up those slots
and you can unlock the safe. K?

00:06:21.667-->00:06:26.667
Have you go back, do do do do
do. That's going to be important
later on. Starting on the top

00:06:29.083-->00:06:33.250
lefthand corner, this thing runs
on an Arduino. It's not a
raspberry pie, it's not some

00:06:33.250-->00:06:36.958
heavy lifting single board
computer. It's just an 8 bit
micro controller, which means we

00:06:36.958-->00:06:42.375
can make this thing portable. Um
next up we've got 3 magnets that
help it stick to the safe. Power

00:06:42.375-->00:06:47.875
supply, that is just an AT power
supply uh common 12 volts 5
volts, you find it fairly often

00:06:47.875-->00:06:52.417
with external hard drives.
Really cheap, um it provides us
with a couple amps on a 12 volt

00:06:52.417-->00:06:57.583
5 volt rails. Uh next is the
erector set that's uh from a
company called Actobotics. That

00:06:57.583-->00:07:02.708
makes it really handy so that we
can reconfigure the robot as we
need it. Um for instance, if you

00:07:02.708-->00:07:05.542
had the dial in a different
place or the handle in a
different place. You can

00:07:05.542-->00:07:12.000
rejigger it real quickly to make
those two things fit. Um the
motor has 8,400 ticks. What that

00:07:12.000-->00:07:16.500
means is that it's a DC motor
that spins really fast. But on
the back end of it, it's got an

00:07:16.500-->00:07:21.708
encoder. So it's a magnet that
passes uh uh a hall effect
sensor. That motor that turns it

00:07:21.708-->00:07:26.167
like I dunno 10-->000 RPM. On the
front of that, there's a
gearhead that gears it down to

00:07:26.167-->00:07:31.167
uh, uh a single rotation so
8,400 turns of the magnet equal
one rotation of the head. So we

00:07:33.792-->00:07:38.792
take 100 digit dial and we split
it into 8,400 individual
segments. Okay? So, that's the

00:07:41.583-->00:07:46.083
motor. Next we have the servo
with feedback, that's the servo
that pulls on the handle and

00:07:46.083-->00:07:51.000
tells us when the handle is
pulled down and let's see. Next
step of building this thing, is

00:07:51.000-->00:07:57.208
we had the 3D model of the safe.
Uh from that we were able to
print uh 3D print coupler. So

00:07:57.208-->00:08:01.667
that coupler fits on the dial
really nicely and tightly. You
can see the little uh flag

00:08:01.667-->00:08:06.500
sticking off of it. We use that
and a photogate. So there's a
photogate uh attached to the

00:08:06.500-->00:08:13.042
arduino that looks for that flag
and sees when it breaks the
beam. When it breaks the beam it

00:08:13.042-->00:08:18.458
knows that it is. Well it knows
the flag is there and it asks
the human, "hey what number am I

00:08:18.458-->00:08:22.958
at?" and the human types in,
"62" and it says "aww okay I now
know where 62 is." It can

00:08:22.958-->00:08:28.875
immediately go to zero. So it's
a way that we can kinda
calibrate hone the dial. This is

00:08:28.875-->00:08:34.875
what the handle puller looks
like so we have a spring that
pulls back uh pulls the handle

00:08:34.875-->00:08:41.167
back up. We have a servo with
this cool nautilus gear. That
allows us to maintain constant

00:08:41.167-->00:08:45.250
torque while pulling on the
handle and then we have some
very fancy string that you can

00:08:45.250-->00:08:49.667
get from anywhere that will
attach the handle to the servo
head. And again we got uh analog

00:08:49.667-->00:08:54.083
feedback on that servo. Um the
way that you do that is you take
any off the shelf servo, you

00:08:54.083-->00:08:58.167
open in up and there's uh uh
potentiometer in there, you
solder it to the center point of

00:08:58.167-->00:09:03.625
that potentiometer and you can
see, you can uh analog voltage
is in relation to where the head

00:09:03.625-->00:09:09.167
is. So now we can say okay the
head is at 45 degrees or it's at
90 degrees and from that we can

00:09:09.167-->00:09:14.167
tell when the handle is open.
This is what the electronics
look like. Um top left corner,

00:09:17.250-->00:09:21.500
motor driver to 15 amp motor
driver because this motor pulls
a couple amps so it's overrated

00:09:21.500-->00:09:26.500
but that's good because we don't
want it to get hot. Um
underneath we've got an arduino

00:09:26.500-->00:09:30.875
right? It's just a red board,
that's the board that SparkFun
makes um we've got a buzzer.

00:09:30.875-->00:09:37.667
Piezo buzzer so it can beep and
let us know when the safe is
open. Um there's, we initially

00:09:37.667-->00:09:42.750
designed a current sensor into
the board thinking that we would
look at how much the current

00:09:42.750-->00:09:49.458
motor was using, to tell when it
started the stall. We found out
that it's actually a lot faster

00:09:49.458-->00:09:53.417
to see the encoder stop so when
we tell the motor to do
something, if we ever see the

00:09:53.417-->00:09:58.958
encoder ever stop turning it's
about 100 milliseconds before we
see the current increase so we

00:09:58.958-->00:10:04.083
don't actually use the current
sensor, we just look at the
encoder. Next is that 12 volt

00:10:04.083-->00:10:10.292
external hard drive power
supply. Uh next we have the
motor control and feedback. So

00:10:10.292-->00:10:12.292
the motors are pretty simple
right? You give is DC power in
one direction and the motor

00:10:12.292-->00:10:16.125
starts turning uh in this case
it's got a couple more pins
because it's giving us feedback

00:10:16.125-->00:10:22.375
to that uh, gives us access to
that encoder so we can read the
encoder, we can power the motor

00:10:22.375-->00:10:25.417
and we can switch the directions
on the motor and then we can
turn the dial in different

00:10:25.417-->00:10:30.417
directions. Uh next up we've got
a display, and I'm just going to
check it out real quick. So

00:10:35.458-->00:10:40.458
currently we're testing 18, 16,
93 um so that's a display 7
segment with a bunch of segments

00:10:43.042-->00:10:48.042
um the interface to that display
is 3 wire so it's serial just
going uh to the display. Um next

00:10:50.667-->00:10:54.708
is the, that home photogate so
it's a really simple
photointerrupter, you power it

00:10:54.708-->00:11:01.208
and um whenever it breaks the
beam you can see that pin go
low. So we can tell the head to

00:11:01.208-->00:11:06.792
turn until we see that beam
broken and we know the flag is
there. Last uh, next up we have

00:11:06.792-->00:11:11.042
a go button. So we wanted to
make this thing as autonomous as
possible. You'll see a red

00:11:11.042-->00:11:17.250
button the the robot so we hear
it, we hit the red button and it
starts doing it's thing. Next

00:11:17.250-->00:11:21.208
up, is the servo and feedback,
again that's where we attached
the servo to find out where the

00:11:21.208-->00:11:26.208
handles at. Now, this is uh we
had to connect all these things
together. Um se this is a pretty

00:11:29.458-->00:11:33.958
simple schematic. There's not a
whole lot going on it's just a
whole series of connectors and

00:11:33.958-->00:11:37.458
making sure that the servo and
buttons and everything are
connected to the right spot on

00:11:37.458-->00:11:41.625
the arduino. Could have done
this with wires, we could have
just inserted things but it's

00:11:41.625-->00:11:45.583
not going to make it very
portable and not going to make
it very reliable. So uh, this is

00:11:45.583-->00:11:51.083
the schematic you can see in the
bottom center is that gear logo.
Um I don't know how many people

00:11:51.083-->00:11:55.875
are familiar with open source
hardware. This is open, yeah
yeah awesome OSHWA uh the open

00:11:55.875-->00:12:00.875
source hardware association um
uh this you can take this
design, you can modify it, you

00:12:00.875-->00:12:04.958
can copy it, you can sell it,
you can do whatever the heck you
want with it. Um and that's the

00:12:04.958-->00:12:09.250
same for all SparkFun products.
We believe that everything
should be open source and you

00:12:09.250-->00:12:13.167
know, if you can learn from me
then I can learn from you and we
can build upon each other's work

00:12:13.167-->00:12:18.292
so this is all open source, this
is the schematic. Uh we turn it
into a printed circuit board so

00:12:18.292-->00:12:22.083
uh this is a really simple
printed circuit board. It's two
sided but the traces are huge

00:12:22.083-->00:12:26.333
and it's all through hole
soldering, and it's- it's really
pretty straight forward. So

00:12:26.333-->00:12:31.333
that's the PCP. Now let's talk a
little bit about the keys and
how we will hopefully get this

00:12:33.792-->00:12:40.667
thing open quickly. Um there is
about a million combinations on
a given safe. And the reason

00:12:40.667-->00:12:44.625
that is is you've got to dial 0
to 99. So it's 100 times 100
times 100. That's a million. If

00:12:44.625-->00:12:48.750
a human walks up to a safe,
think about it, you gotta clear
the dial right? And then you

00:12:48.750-->00:12:52.000
gotta dial in the first one and
you gotta dial the second one
and the third one and pull on

00:12:52.000-->00:12:56.958
the handle. Takes about 10
seconds for a human to do that.
Um so worst case, if we were to

00:12:56.958-->00:13:03.625
brute force this, it would take
115 days of non stop trying
every 10 second. So the first

00:13:03.625-->00:13:08.917
exploit that came about was how
we could uh reduce the overall
key set. I don't know if you

00:13:08.917-->00:13:13.917
noticed but we are only testing
93 over, over, and over again.
Why is that? That's because uh

00:13:17.333-->00:13:21.875
oh let me take 1 step back um.
So 100 times 100, we can
actually reduce that a little

00:13:21.875-->00:13:28.542
bit. They design the safes so
that if the digit is say 56.
Humans are really bad at doing

00:13:28.542-->00:13:35.000
fine stuff. So it's hard to get
56 just right so they design the
safes so that 57 and 55 will

00:13:35.000-->00:13:40.375
work so it's a 3 digit window so
we're not actually trying all
100 we just have to hit that

00:13:40.375-->00:13:47.042
middle digit. So we're doing 33
times 33 times 33, it's still 4
days. It's mind numbingly slow.

00:13:47.042-->00:13:52.875
So this is what the inside of
the safe looks like. There are 3
dials and the 2 white ones and a

00:13:52.875-->00:13:57.875
black one, if you see that black
one, it's got a bunch of uh
indents on it and that's what we

00:13:57.875-->00:14:02.875
call those indentations. Those
are there uh yeah so there are
11 small indents and then

00:14:06.833-->00:14:12.417
there's one large indent and
that's the solutions slot. So we
know that one of those 12

00:14:12.417-->00:14:18.417
indents has to be the solutions
slot. So we don't have to try
all 33 digits on the last disk,

00:14:18.417-->00:14:23.417
we only need to try um 12 on
disk C that's the black disk. So
now we've reduced the solutions

00:14:25.542-->00:14:30.542
set 33 times 33 times 12 still
at 1 and a half days. The real
kicker came when um I took apart

00:14:32.833-->00:14:37.833
the safe and found out that the
solution indent on this older
model safe is slightly different

00:14:40.792-->00:14:45.792
in size okay? So that small
indent is about ten thousandths
of an inch smaller than the

00:14:49.042-->00:14:54.042
other 11 shallow indent. So from
the outside of the safe, if we
have a sensitive enough motor we

00:14:56.292-->00:15:01.292
can measure those indents and
find the skinniest indent. So if
we can do that then we can take

00:15:04.083-->00:15:11.042
disk C down to 1. We have the
solution number within about 20
seconds. So if disk C has the

00:15:11.042-->00:15:16.042
skinny indent. We take 33 times
33 times 1. We're now down to
about 3 hour test time. So the

00:15:18.375-->00:15:22.833
first thing I want to show you,
well no, I got to show you all
sorts of stuff but this is the

00:15:22.833-->00:15:28.542
model safe we had back in
Boulder uh that we got off
craigslist. Uh and it's really

00:15:28.542-->00:15:32.750
cool and that's the one we
cracked open, it worked well.
The problem is we wanted to do

00:15:32.750-->00:15:37.958
this demo at def con. This safe
is about 10 years old and you
can no longer get this model

00:15:37.958-->00:15:43.000
safe. Awesome, so we looked
around and said "well what is
the model of safe we can buy

00:15:43.000-->00:15:49.167
at." What's that? [inaudible]
We're good. Okay. What's the
model safe we can buy here in

00:15:49.167-->00:15:54.667
Vegas, we bought this safe at
Home Depot. This is the model
you can get readily available in

00:15:54.667-->00:15:59.667
Vegas. Now something should jump
out at your about this picture.
What is it? There's keys, where

00:16:02.667-->00:16:08.375
the hell did those come from?
Those weren't on the original
model safe. So when we've found,

00:16:08.375-->00:16:13.375
we saw the model safe in Vegas.
We're like okay cool let's get
the same model in Boulder I buy

00:16:13.375-->00:16:17.208
this same model in Boulder,
where we're from and I take it
up to Rob's office and I'm like

00:16:17.208-->00:16:22.208
hey we got this safe and I'm
like "Oh my God, wh-wha-what is,
there's keys now? This isn't

00:16:22.208-->00:16:27.375
gonna work." I know the Def Con
audience is really understanding
about demos but we can't just

00:16:27.375-->00:16:32.708
show up with a robot that
doesn't work. How are we going
to open this lock? Well anybody

00:16:32.708-->00:16:37.708
who knows tubular locks right?
Um this is the first time in my
life where I used a big pen.

00:16:40.042-->00:16:46.542
[laughter] to open a lock. It
works really, really well.
[laughter] It's incredible so uh

00:16:46.542-->00:16:52.208
sure enough if you find this
safe and you need to get it
open, build one of these robots

00:16:52.208-->00:16:58.750
and bring a big pen with you,
that's all you need. So inside
this safe, again we've never

00:16:58.750-->00:17:04.667
opened this safe. We bought it
yesterday, um God I hope we get
it open. But um, this is what

00:17:04.667-->00:17:09.667
the inside of our safe, same
model in Boulder looks like. Ok?
Same 12 indents, all plastic now

00:17:12.625-->00:17:18.958
the interesting thing about this
disk C is that the solution slot
is actually fifty thousandths of

00:17:18.958-->00:17:23.917
an inch larger than all the
other indents. That may not
sound like a lot but that's 54

00:17:23.917-->00:17:29.333
ticks on the encoder. That's,
that's a huge gaping, like
i-it's such a sore thumb it

00:17:29.333-->00:17:34.333
sticks out at you. So uh this is
how, what it looks like um. How
we measure the indents. So the

00:17:38.750-->00:17:44.792
robot will spin the disks to an
indent and then it will apply
pressure on the handle and rock

00:17:44.792-->00:17:48.833
the wheel back and forth. Now
remember the encoder is giving
us feedback so we can say "okay

00:17:48.833-->00:17:54.000
the encoder is at 17 and then it
went to 312" and then we do the
subtraction and say "okay that

00:17:54.000-->00:17:59.000
indent is this many ticks wide."
And we do that for each indent.
And I think, yup we'll

00:18:03.583-->00:18:08.583
eventually do the solutions
slot, measures that. [inaudible
noise] Got it? K. That's how you

00:18:11.125-->00:18:15.625
measure the indents. Now we're
not trying anything yet but we
are establishing what those

00:18:15.625-->00:18:20.625
indent widths are. So [deep
breathe] this is what the output
from the terminal looks like.

00:18:22.750-->00:18:29.000
Nothing may jump out at you
except that. The width of that
indent is like a sore thumb,

00:18:29.000-->00:18:34.458
It's much bigger than any other
indents. So our software says
"okay cool, the large indent

00:18:34.458-->00:18:39.250
number is 6, that is the number
I'm going to try for all other
combinations." So in this case,

00:18:39.250-->00:18:44.250
we think the indent is 93, we're
really, really hoping the
solution indent is 93. Uh we're

00:18:47.667-->00:18:52.667
gonna see if it works or not. Uh
we're pretty sure. So, we know
we have the solutions disk C.

00:18:55.917-->00:19:01.625
It's 33 times 33, it still takes
about 3 hours so how are we
going to do this is under 45

00:19:01.625-->00:19:05.833
minutes? There's some other
things that we can do. How can
we get the test time down from

00:19:05.833-->00:19:11.667
10 seconds to something shorter?
Um this is something we created
called set testing so uh we've

00:19:11.667-->00:19:16.833
got the test time down to about
4 seconds per test. We can even
go a little bit faster than

00:19:16.833-->00:19:22.500
that. Um but let me demonstrate
what set testing is cause it's a
little complicated. Um well it's

00:19:22.500-->00:19:25.125
not complicated it's hard to
describe. So, hum hum, so this,
I'm going to play this animation

00:19:25.125-->00:19:27.125
again but disk C is the blue
disk. Disk B is the green disk.
Now we have those interference

00:19:27.125-->00:19:29.125
points right? To test as quickly
as possible, I shouldn't reset
all the disks. I'm a robot, I

00:19:29.125-->00:19:31.125
know exactly where the disks are
so I shouldn't have to reset B.
I tested C and now I'm gonna

00:19:31.125-->00:19:33.125
turn C until it interferes with
B. B will move three digits and
then C returns to where it needs

00:19:33.125-->00:19:35.125
to be and we test again. So we
do this, we turn B, we bring it
back, we turn B, we bring it

00:19:35.125-->00:19:37.125
back. And I want to show you the
next video of that in practice.
Set testing and take

00:19:37.125-->00:19:39.125
measurement. MMk so this is,
it-it the robot. Oh that set
testing, measurements there we

00:19:39.125-->00:19:43.708
go. So we test, we move the
disk, we test, we move the disk,
we test and you can see that

00:19:43.708-->00:19:48.333
slot opens up a little bit and
keeps going and we go right
through it. Now realize that

00:19:48.333-->00:19:53.333
this is just a quick little
video but we're testing a large
number of combinations in the 10

00:19:59.125-->00:20:04.125
seconds it takes to watch this
video. We're screening through
combinations as quickly as we

00:20:42.750-->00:20:47.750
can. Hmm, okay so doo-doo if we
can get the set time, test time
per combination down to about 4

00:20:57.292-->00:21:04.000
seconds how are we gonna get it
down to 45 minutes. We can't,
it's all luck. It's to the demo

00:21:04.000-->00:21:10.083
Gods of Def Con to try to get
this thing open in 45 minutes.
[laughter] It's not an exploit,

00:21:10.083-->00:21:15.208
it's just luck. Um so you may
ask yourself uh okay, how can we
improve upon this technology?

00:21:15.208-->00:21:20.208
How do I protect myself? Well
there's a couple things, um if
you don't like combination locks

00:21:22.292-->00:21:26.958
get one with a key pad right?
The one in the middle has a
keypad and my robot does not

00:21:26.958-->00:21:32.583
work on keypads, however before
you buy the model of safe in the
middle, I suggest you search for

00:21:32.583-->00:21:37.583
it on the internet because that
safe can be opened faster than
we can open this one. You take a

00:21:37.583-->00:21:41.917
high powered magnet, you take it
outside and there's a solenoid
that when you type in the

00:21:41.917-->00:21:46.292
keypay, that solenoid pulls the
pin and you can open the safe?
Well if you take a high powered

00:21:46.292-->00:21:50.167
magnet and you can activate the
solenoid using that magnet from
the outside and you can open the

00:21:50.167-->00:21:55.167
safe in a couple seconds.
[laughter] Do your research. Um
well Nathan, I could just spend

00:21:58.333-->00:22:03.042
more money on a safe. Yes you
could, there's lots of good
secure safes out there for um ya

00:22:03.042-->00:22:09.000
know a thousand dollars. Um you
can get a safe that doesn't have
plastic internals right? This

00:22:09.000-->00:22:14.042
safe is the most, common model
at home dept, Lowes and all the
other places. So this is the one

00:22:14.042-->00:22:18.750
that we wanted to exploit
because this is probably the one
that everyone has. However if

00:22:18.750-->00:22:22.375
you spend a whole bunch of money
you can get a jewelers safe but
you can also get the SG6030 the

00:22:22.375-->00:22:24.375
interesting thing about this is
that um the only people that buy
this are locksmiths because they

00:22:24.375-->00:22:26.375
are the only ones who can
actually dial in the single
digit combination. Remember, our

00:22:26.375-->00:22:28.375
safe has that plus or minus one
digit so if you dial in 56 and
it's supposed to be 55, it's

00:22:28.375-->00:22:33.375
still going to work. This lock
you have to be dead on and it's
so bad that most users can't

00:22:44.500-->00:22:49.500
open their own safe. And there's
always someone around with a
thermolance [laughter] right? No

00:22:53.167-->00:23:00.125
matter how much money you spend
on a safe. There's, uh nothing
is impervious. So few things

00:23:00.125-->00:23:06.875
about future research, um we
found out that as you, there's 2
aspects, 2 motors on our robot.

00:23:06.875-->00:23:11.750
One is the motor that spins the
dial and the other one pulls on
the handle. We have a very

00:23:11.750-->00:23:17.625
sensitive motor that uh turns
the dial. We can also get a very
sensitive servo that pulls on

00:23:17.625-->00:23:22.625
the handle. At, giving us
feedback about how far down the
handle has been pulled. Um, if

00:23:26.958-->00:23:33.417
the ha, we uh let's see. Based
on the depth at which the handle
is going, we ought to be able to

00:23:33.417-->00:23:38.167
glean some information about the
disks inside the safe. I don't
know if we can or not, but we

00:23:38.167-->00:23:44.250
can get uh depth feedback from
the servo. Something to look
into. Uh another one, this is

00:23:44.250-->00:23:49.250
from my friend TJ. This is an
idea, it's called impulse
response we ought to be able to

00:23:49.250-->00:23:55.083
slam the arm into the disks and
listen to what it sounds like.
If there's 3 pieces of plastic

00:23:55.083-->00:24:00.667
there. We should hear one sound.
Humans probably won't be able to
detect this but a computer could

00:24:00.667-->00:24:07.333
look and do the analysis and say
ah there's 3 pieces or plastic
there or in this case. You can

00:24:07.333-->00:24:11.583
barely see there is one slot
lined up to whenever we slam
into it. There's only 2 pieces

00:24:11.583-->00:24:16.875
of plastic, we should have a
different impulse response. If
we can make this happen then I

00:24:16.875-->00:24:20.167
won't have to stand next to a
safe that isn't open. Uh we
should be able to open it up a

00:24:20.167-->00:24:25.167
lot faster. Uh next, we have a
uh 3D printed coupler that works
with this dial. So if you want

00:24:29.042-->00:24:34.292
to hack into this safe you have
to get measurements of that
safe, measurements of that dial

00:24:34.292-->00:24:39.292
or on a safe similar to it. Um
in this case, uh there are
really interesting grabbers uh

00:24:42.750-->00:24:48.708
this is uh from irobot and it's
basically a balloon filled full
of coffee grounds. You press it

00:24:48.708-->00:24:54.000
up against the thing and then
suck the air out of the balloon
and it turns into a uh hard

00:24:54.000-->00:24:58.417
gripper, so you can grip all
sorts of different objects and
different shapes. Um a few shown

00:24:58.417-->00:25:03.917
here we may be able to create uh
a coupler that you shove onto a
disk, you evacuate the air and

00:25:03.917-->00:25:08.375
then you have a very tight grip
on whatever dial any, any size
or shape dial you've got.

00:25:12.500-->00:25:18.125
Another thing, uh the next safe
that we would like to work on is
the uh keypad safe. So these are

00:25:18.125-->00:25:23.792
the ones that you often find in
the hotel room um or uh the one
I suggested before. There are

00:25:23.792-->00:25:28.792
machi- [beeping] >>Woo!
[applause] [silence] [laughter]
[uproarious applause] >>What's

00:25:58.292-->00:26:03.292
in the safe?! >>I don't know!
[indescribable] >>OH yeah, So
the combination to the safe is

00:26:23.208-->00:26:28.208
>>51, 36, 93 [applause] [speaker
exhales sharply] >>Man oh man,
okay. I'm- I'm done now.

00:26:36.500-->00:26:42.125
[laughter] Um, lastly we- we
ought to look at the- we ought
to be able to see the tactile

00:26:42.125-->00:26:48.583
feedback of buttons. So uh using
a load cell on a pen we ought to
be able to press the button and

00:26:48.583-->00:26:53.542
see where the tactile force
fails and from that you can see
which buttons have been worn

00:26:53.542-->00:26:58.625
out. In theory, this is future
research. Not sure if we can but
we've done a lot with load

00:26:58.625-->00:27:04.042
cells. And this is a common
testing method for tactile uh
tactile feedback of buttons. It

00:27:04.042-->00:27:08.500
might work, um yeah and then
once you have the number of
buttons figured out it's just in

00:27:08.500-->00:27:13.292
factorial. This is all really
boring compared to that
[laughter] so yeah I'm um. We

00:27:13.292-->00:27:18.292
got it open. That's all I got.
[applause]
