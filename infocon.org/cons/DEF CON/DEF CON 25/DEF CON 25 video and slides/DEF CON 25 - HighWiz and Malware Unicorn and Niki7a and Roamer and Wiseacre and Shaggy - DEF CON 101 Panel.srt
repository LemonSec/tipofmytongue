00:00:00.042-->00:00:05.833
>>So this talk is Def Con 101
it’s a panel and they’re gonna
teach you guys how to Def Con

00:00:05.833-->00:00:10.417
appropriately so hope you guys
get something out of this
[Audience hoots] and ah I’m

00:00:10.417-->00:00:15.417
going to let these guys
introduce themselves. >>There’s
dance lights, just in case. So

00:00:19.583-->00:00:24.583
alright we’re going to start
this off by throwing out a few
t-shirts [Audience hoots and

00:00:49.667-->00:00:54.667
claps]. That’s the kind of
enthusiasm we should have for
talks! >>When do we get to whip

00:01:01.000-->00:01:06.000
the coins out? >> Yep we’ll
>>Yeah, we’ll be throwing out
challenge coins too. Alright how

00:01:10.458-->00:01:17.125
many people in here are brand
new to Def Con [] that is
awesome there are lot of you and

00:01:17.125-->00:01:22.667
every single one of you should
be proud that you’re a Noob. So
as you can see on the slide,

00:01:22.667-->00:01:28.833
welcome to Las Vegas. Pace
yourself if you’ve never been
here before [laughter] Trust me

00:01:28.833-->00:01:33.875
the first time I was here I
didn’t know. I thought ah, this
was really cool and then I end

00:01:33.875-->00:01:38.333
up in a cab and the cabby’s
going hey, you fell asleep I
don’t know where you’re supposed

00:01:38.333-->00:01:43.333
to go. [Laughter] Alright, in
Def Con everyone is a Noob, ah
at something you know this is ah

00:01:48.708-->00:01:55.583
what we wanna do when you come
to Def Con is get you to learn
stuff. That’s why you’re here

00:01:55.583-->00:02:00.417
you’re not here for any other
reason other than to learn. If
you’re here for a different

00:02:00.417-->00:02:06.083
reason then you spent $260 for
that reason but you might as
well take advantage of the fact

00:02:06.083-->00:02:12.375
that there, Def Con has a lot to
offer. And on the bottom DGAF
somebody says that you’re a

00:02:12.375-->00:02:17.375
Noob, don’t give a f*k.[audience
applauses] Here’s something that
I probably should have said to

00:02:23.333-->00:02:28.333
start this off, there may be one
or two cuss words in this.
[Laughter] You know it’s a

00:02:30.917-->00:02:36.125
serious talk but it’s not a
serious talk. We encourage
people to participate, we

00:02:36.125-->00:02:40.917
encourage you guys to
participate and there will be
active participation at the end

00:02:40.917-->00:02:45.917
of this talk. >> That’s not very
authoritative >>Yeah >> There
will be active participation! >>

00:02:48.667-->00:02:53.333
[Laughs] in case you missed
that, that was authoritative.
There will be participation!

00:02:53.333-->00:02:59.042
This is a desert, stay hydrated
and if your pee looks like
Guinness you are in bad

00:02:59.042-->00:03:04.042
shape.[Audience laughs] There
are water stations all over the
place. There are ah bars all

00:03:06.542-->00:03:12.792
over the place. Um, try and mix
it up, don’t always hit the bar.
But otherwise >> There’s water

00:03:12.792-->00:03:17.208
at the bar too. >>Yeah you can
get water at the bar but you
know try and mix it up don’t

00:03:17.208-->00:03:22.208
always get alcohol. >> Beer or
water >>What’s >>Solid plan
>>Yeah >>Beer or water? No, both

00:03:25.417-->00:03:30.417
get em both going and if you ah
read the book ‘Dune’ then you
can talk about recycling. >>or

00:03:33.292-->00:03:38.292
just buy a Bud Light it’s
premixed for you >> [Laughter]
Alright there are simple rules

00:03:40.500-->00:03:45.500
ah surviving at Def Con this is
a a countdown. It’s important,
you need to get at least three

00:03:47.667-->00:03:53.500
hours sleep at night. A, my
second Def Con here I
participated in capture the

00:03:53.500-->00:03:59.750
flag. That year they thought it
would be fun to make Capture the
Flag, be around the clock. So I

00:03:59.750-->00:04:05.875
didn’t get to sleep for 36 hours
and then promptly missed the
rest of Def Con. So, you know,

00:04:05.875-->00:04:10.833
it’s gonna be important that you
get a little bit of ah rest,
also it keeps your brain ah

00:04:10.833-->00:04:17.083
working properly, so you’re not
addled all the time. [pause] You
should eat at least two meals a

00:04:17.083-->00:04:23.375
day, it is easy, when you’re at
Def Con, to forget to eat
because you’re doing things,

00:04:23.375-->00:04:26.917
you’re running from talk to
talk, you’re trying to make sure
you’re in the front row here.

00:04:26.917-->00:04:32.583
And you know it’s gonna be ah
challenging, but make sure you
take time for yourself, make

00:04:32.583-->00:04:36.500
sure you take time to eat. >>I
don’t know looking over this
crowd, it’s dismal. >>Here’s an

00:04:36.500-->00:04:42.792
important one. Please bathe at
least once a day. You are in the
desert you are going to sweat

00:04:42.792-->00:04:49.792
and you are going to, you know,
stink if you sweat. Sorry there
are only very few people that I

00:04:49.792-->00:04:56.000
know that actually don’t stink
when they sweat. So, um, make
sure you bathe at least once a

00:04:56.000-->00:05:01.000
day and ah, wash your hands too.
Um, this one is really important
I can’t stress it enough in fact

00:05:04.208-->00:05:09.667
we’ll get to more, a little bit
more to that um in a little bit.
I would like to talk about

00:05:09.667-->00:05:14.750
shirts. We threw out a bunch of
shirts those shirts are a little
long, um please make sure you

00:05:14.750-->00:05:19.750
wear a shirt that is the right
size. Under-boob is sexy,
underbelly is not. [Audience

00:05:22.000-->00:05:28.250
laugh] >> Speak for yourself
>>[Laughter] Alright again,
washing your hands. The Def Con

00:05:28.250-->00:05:33.000
crud, for those of you who’ve
never been here before, you’ve
probably heard a story about,

00:05:33.000-->00:05:36.875
stories about people who leave
and then they get sick and then
they’re sick for like a week and

00:05:36.875-->00:05:41.750
they can’t shake it. And, you
know, it might be from Def Con,
it might be from the aeroplane,

00:05:41.750-->00:05:46.750
it might be from anything in the
world. But an important rule of
thumb, fist you’re your friends.

00:05:50.250-->00:05:55.250
[Audience laughs] fist them
often. [Pause, audience member
responds] Dude, Um, you can’t

00:05:57.375-->00:06:01.667
really, you may not be able to
see it , but that little story
says, there was a scientific

00:06:01.667-->00:06:06.667
study that is says 90% fewer ah
chance of catching germs if you
fist people rather than shake

00:06:09.167-->00:06:14.167
their hands. So, seriously, wash
your damn hands and fist your
friends. [Pause] Some simple

00:06:20.250-->00:06:25.250
rules, [Laughter] don’t be a
dick, [pause and laughter], this
guy [laughter]. There’s some

00:06:29.458-->00:06:34.458
simple basics, you know, when
you’re, there are going to be 20
000 plus people here, I hope and

00:06:37.333-->00:06:43.417
you know when you’re doing that
you have to [stutter] just some
common courtesy. Hold the door;

00:06:43.417-->00:06:48.500
because people are pouring in
don’t let the door slam on
somebody. You know, make sure

00:06:48.500-->00:06:53.250
that you keep your head up don’t
get your head in the program or
have your head buried in the

00:06:53.250-->00:06:59.292
phone. Because there are, will
be people that will walk right
into you and remind you that you

00:06:59.292-->00:07:05.500
should’ve kept your head up. Um,
pay attention, pay attention to
everything’s that’s around you.

00:07:05.500-->00:07:11.167
Don’t block the hallways you’ll
notice tomorrow that, you know
while the hallways are pretty

00:07:11.167-->00:07:16.500
easy to navigate right now,
tomorrow they’re gonna be a lot
harder to navigate. And don’t

00:07:16.500-->00:07:22.000
stand at the base of the
escalator, fortunately the hotel
scheduled some maintenance on

00:07:22.000-->00:07:27.167
the escalators ah for this
weekend, so that means that
three of them or four of them or

00:07:27.167-->00:07:31.625
however many of them are out. So
it’s gonna be really important,
the Goons are going to help you

00:07:31.625-->00:07:36.708
get around and navigate and just
make sure that you don’t decide
to stop and have a family

00:07:36.708-->00:07:41.708
reunion at the bottom of the
escalator. [Pause] Please don’t
be an ass hat, do not ruins

00:07:44.167-->00:07:49.083
everyone’s time. You may think
something is funny, like we
might be up here and I might

00:07:49.083-->00:07:54.875
make a joke I might think it’s
funny, you might not, you may
take offense. I’m the speaker so

00:07:54.875-->00:07:59.875
I get to do that, but please
don’t, try not to ruin everybody
else’s time. An important rule,

00:08:02.375-->00:08:07.375
don’t heckle, [pause] kay just
checkin. [Laughter] If you don’t
agree with a something in the

00:08:09.875-->00:08:14.458
talk, if you think that, you
know, something is way off base
or you know you have some other

00:08:14.458-->00:08:19.542
different piece of information,
that’s okay. You have an
opportunity to speak to the

00:08:19.542-->00:08:25.833
speaker afterwards and the
speakers are supposed to go to
the speaker room um to do some

00:08:25.833-->00:08:30.250
speaking, but none of them ever
do. We just hang out right here
on the side. [Laughter] >>No we

00:08:30.250-->00:08:35.250
don’t. >> Yeah, also don’t be an
ass hat. Also, ah, another
thing, you’re gonna come up and

00:08:39.208-->00:08:42.917
you’re gonna see your friends
and for a lot of people Def Con
is the one place where they see

00:08:42.917-->00:08:48.125
people once a year. You know,
the rest of the time everyone
lives on the computer out in the

00:08:48.125-->00:08:54.500
interwebs, ah, inner tubes. If
you’re gonna hug somebody make
sure that they’re ready for that

00:08:54.500-->00:09:00.458
hug. You know, don’t go up and
try and hug somebody and then
they get Tyrannosaurus Rex arms

00:09:00.458-->00:09:05.458
because they’re you know, not
comfortable with that. Phones
and wireless, you’re at a hacker

00:09:09.667-->00:09:14.958
convention man, if you haven’t
taken care of all of that stuff,
updating your phone, turning

00:09:14.958-->00:09:21.667
your wireless, making sure your
Bluetooth is set properly, all
those things. You know, it’s

00:09:21.667-->00:09:26.667
gonna be a, a problem for you.
So, check that. You probably
should have updated things

00:09:29.083-->00:09:34.083
before now. Um, also with
pictures, everybody has a phone,
everybody’s phone has a camera

00:09:36.292-->00:09:42.167
and I say everybody that might
be hyperbole, but for now let’s
assume that everyone has a phone

00:09:42.167-->00:09:46.333
with a camera in it. You’re
gonna be in a picture or two,
there are some people who that’s

00:09:46.333-->00:09:51.917
their job. You’re gonna be in a
picture or two right now. If you
don’t wanna be in a picture, ask

00:09:51.917-->00:09:58.125
that person nicely and ask them
to delete it. If it really is a
problem, you can always find a

00:09:58.125-->00:10:04.250
Goon, but let’s be honest you’re
in a public place so you don’t
have a whole lot of leg to stand

00:10:04.250-->00:10:09.250
on. This is a different
conference than most security
conferences, we don’t have tons

00:10:13.917-->00:10:19.208
of giveaways, we don’t have
corporate sponsors giving stuff
away. So if you see something,

00:10:19.208-->00:10:24.208
chances are it’s not free. >>
Anyone want a free T-shirt?
[Audience responds] >>Giving is

00:10:30.333-->00:10:35.333
different from taking.
[Laughter] Alright, Def Con,
there’s a lot of stuff going on.

00:10:38.167-->00:10:42.000
That we have a lot of tracks,
there are a lot of talks. I
think we have more talks Nikita,

00:10:42.000-->00:10:46.000
than we ever have? We’re gonna
>> Lie and say we do >> Yeah,
we’re gonna lie and say we do

00:10:46.000-->00:10:51.000
>>Yeah that’s fine >>Um, but you
need to have a plan. Ah, look at
your program, make sure when

00:10:53.417-->00:10:58.667
you’re reading your program you
know what’s going on. Um, try
and identify where you need to

00:10:58.667-->00:11:03.667
go because there’s a lot of
space too. Ah, um, I covered, ah
six and a half miles yesterday,

00:11:06.500-->00:11:13.000
just walking the space. Um, also
hacker trackers an awesome
program, it’s an app for your

00:11:13.000-->00:11:19.167
phone. You can get it online,
ah, um, the, ah app store, you
can get it on Google Play, you

00:11:19.167-->00:11:25.875
can get it, um, in these really
bright lights [Laughter]. Um,
you know you probably should’ve

00:11:25.875-->00:11:30.875
downloaded it before now. Again
the talks fill up quickly, you
can see a lot of people back

00:11:30.875-->00:11:35.125
there. The Goons are doing a
good job, speaker Goons and
other Goons making sure that

00:11:35.125-->00:11:40.125
people aren’t, ah standing in
the isles and planting
themselves against the wall. Um,

00:11:42.125-->00:11:47.542
so you might consider finding ah
the source of knowledge and
purchasing the videos. If

00:11:47.542-->00:11:51.917
they’re here, hopefully?
>>They’re here >>Okay, awesome.
>>They’ll have a booth in the

00:11:51.917-->00:11:57.292
hallway too. >>Just a word, ah
about the tracker app, ah
Whitney the champion, short

00:11:57.292-->00:12:02.625
stacks, she’s the one that
created the original one, ah,
she turned over the, ah,

00:12:02.625-->00:12:07.292
android, ah, branch of it to
somebody else. Again this is
something you should’ve have

00:12:07.292-->00:12:14.000
downloaded before, but it is
pretty awesome it does make
things a lot easier. Alright,

00:12:14.000-->00:12:19.000
there are tons of talks. Um,
this handsome person that you
see in that picture, I’m giving

00:12:21.708-->00:12:28.500
a talk, there are tons, so again
I just want to make sure that
everybody has a plan. >> You

00:12:28.500-->00:12:33.542
know what, that everybody does
have a plan >> Yeah >>Till they
get punched in the mouth >>Yeah,

00:12:33.542-->00:12:38.583
Mike Tyson is going to be in
Mandalay Bay tomorrow. >> Is he
really? >>Yeah, pretty neat. All

00:12:38.583-->00:12:44.417
right, the villages, there are a
ton of villages. I’m not gonna
read them all, but I will read

00:12:44.417-->00:12:50.625
as many as it takes. [Laughter]
Um, some some of the highlights:
Biohacking Village, Crypto and

00:12:50.625-->00:12:56.542
Privacy Village, you heard about
that from Trey. Ah, Hardware
Hacking Village, ICS Village, ah

00:12:56.542-->00:13:03.375
the Lockpick Village is very
popular. Um, Recon Village is
new. Ah, the Skytalks are not

00:13:03.375-->00:13:08.375
new, they’ve been around. Roots
are ah, is, um, Def Con for
kids, ah, um and then the Voting

00:13:11.542-->00:13:17.417
Machine Hacking Village is also
brand new. This is something
that, ah, Dark Tangent decided

00:13:17.417-->00:13:23.292
that he wanted to ‘put up or
shut up’ he wanted people to
actually be able to test to see

00:13:23.292-->00:13:28.042
whether or not the um, voting
machines can be hacked. So this
is something that’s going to be

00:13:28.042-->00:13:34.458
really interesting and followed
closely by the press. And Wi-Fi
Village, I was told that if I

00:13:34.458-->00:13:38.958
did not mention Wi-Fi Village,
somebody would be really
disappointed. But Wi-Fi Village

00:13:38.958-->00:13:44.750
is actually really cool, some of
the stuff that they’re doing,
um, is pretty fascinating and

00:13:44.750-->00:13:49.750
I’m a Noob at that. [Pause]
Nothing, alright. There are too
many contests to list, you know,

00:13:52.667-->00:13:58.333
contests and events is all over
the place, but I do want to
highlight a few; Capture The

00:13:58.333-->00:14:03.333
Flag, um, people love it. Um,
there is no Badge Hack this
year, um, which is fine because

00:14:06.417-->00:14:12.625
you can hack the contests. This
is Def Con, you should be
hacking everything you can. Um,

00:14:12.625-->00:14:17.625
and the contests, ah, is
included. Alright, hack
everything you can that doesn’t

00:14:17.625-->00:14:22.625
get you arrested. [Pause]
Workshops and demos, I bet, how
many people new that you can

00:14:25.833-->00:14:30.833
even get, um, hands on
experience here at Def Con?
Anybody, few people? Yeah, you

00:14:33.083-->00:14:37.333
can sign up for workshops you
can’t sign up form now they’re
all sold out, but you could’ve

00:14:37.333-->00:14:43.042
signed up for them. This is
something to think about for the
future. Um, and then demo labs,

00:14:43.042-->00:14:48.042
ah, is actually pretty cool, ah,
these are, ah, top talks about
tools and it’s not enough to be

00:14:50.458-->00:14:55.458
a big talk but it’s specifically
about tools and you get to
experience it ,um, hands on.

00:14:58.250-->00:15:03.625
Swag and vendor, I already said
Def Con is unique; Def Con is
not like Blackhat as an example.

00:15:03.625-->00:15:08.292
Ah, the people that are in the
swag, and the people that are in
the vendor area, they are

00:15:08.292-->00:15:13.667
selling here, they’re selling
stuff that support their
business, their businesses

00:15:13.667-->00:15:19.042
support the community in
general. Um, you may see some
corporate organizations in there

00:15:19.042-->00:15:25.833
but they have ties back to the,
ah, community. Free stuff for
the community, as an example,

00:15:25.833-->00:15:32.708
Pony Express, they’ve been,
they’ve been a vendor here since
Def Con 11, Chris? >>Sounds

00:15:32.708-->00:15:37.708
legit >> Okay, yeah, a long
time, back when they were 100%
open source. And you know, ah,

00:15:40.167-->00:15:45.167
they still provide their product
open source. [Pause] Alright,
I’m gonna double dog dare you

00:15:48.583-->00:15:53.583
guys, you need to reach out.
I’m, take a second, pretend, yes
you can reach out. Pretend the

00:15:57.417-->00:16:01.458
[pause] all of the funny people
reaching out, thank you, you.
I’m going to go back to my

00:16:01.458-->00:16:06.458
previous slide, um, take a
second to introduce yourself to
the person next to you. And

00:16:08.667-->00:16:13.667
seriously, take a second to
introduce yourself to the person
next to you. [Audience responds

00:16:27.542-->00:16:32.542
to each other] I know, isn’t it
great, this is awesome. This is
something you guys should be

00:16:48.417-->00:16:53.417
doing all weekend long. [Pause]
What’s that? >> Except during
talks >>Yeah, don’t do during

00:16:55.458-->00:17:01.250
talks unless the speaker, don’t
do it in the bathroom. You know
introduce yourselves and make

00:17:01.250-->00:17:06.375
sure you get to know some
people. Put yourself out there,
and find somebody that you have

00:17:06.375-->00:17:11.667
something in common with. The
reason I say this, there are a
lot of people who come to Def

00:17:11.667-->00:17:16.667
Con by themselves. This is, ah,
you guys can stop introducing
yourselves. [Laughter] There are

00:17:19.958-->00:17:25.500
a lot of people who come here by
themselves; they don’t have
people to hang out with. And

00:17:25.500-->00:17:30.500
it’s gonna be, actually, really,
cool to make this a community,
to make sure that everybody here

00:17:32.542-->00:17:37.792
has something they have in, ah,
common with. Find somebody,
whether you’re from the same

00:17:37.792-->00:17:42.958
country, whether you from a
different city, it doesn’t
matter you know, if you guys do

00:17:42.958-->00:17:48.792
all the same if you have the
same little niche thing to do.
It’s kind of cool to be able to,

00:17:48.792-->00:17:53.792
ah, get in touch with people.
I’m also going to triple dog
dare you. I want you guys to

00:17:56.583-->00:18:01.583
consider, doing something you’ve
never done before. You know, um,
you might not know it, but I

00:18:05.750-->00:18:11.417
have social anxiety. Ah,
conversations with me, if I
don’t know you, generally go,

00:18:11.417-->00:18:18.042
‘Hi, I’m Mike’ [Pause] >> Hi
Mike >> Then there’s. Ah, hi
Dare, how you doin. [Audience

00:18:18.042-->00:18:24.250
claps] And then, I know Dare, so
I can have a conversation, but
if not, there’s awkward silence.

00:18:24.250-->00:18:29.333
There might be an awkward hug, I
don’t know, but you know, but
still put yourself out there.

00:18:29.333-->00:18:35.125
This is is kind of important to
be able to, ah, try and do
something you’ve never done.

00:18:35.125-->00:18:40.792
Find experiences, you might find
you really like them. Try one of
the Villages and go to a party.

00:18:40.792-->00:18:45.750
Find a party and go to one. I’m
gonna suggest a party, there’s a
party right after this, called

00:18:45.750-->00:18:50.750
the Noob party. [Audience makes
noise] Did you, did you turn
your mike off? [Pause] >> Yeah

00:18:56.000-->00:19:01.000
>>That was all of us >> Free
beer! >>free beer at the Noob
party >> There you go, its

00:19:03.625-->00:19:08.250
back.[Audience claps] Um, Duo
security and I’ve got another
slide. Duo security, is

00:19:08.250-->00:19:14.833
sponsored, they’ve been kind
enough to actually buy a bunch
of kegs for this party. Um, so

00:19:14.833-->00:19:19.958
it’s free beer until the beer
runs out, then its pay for the
beer.[Audience applauses] That’s

00:19:19.958-->00:19:24.958
in the Octavius
Ballroom[Audience applauses] And
now I’m going to take a second,

00:19:28.000-->00:19:33.250
um, to have Priest come up here,
he wants to talk about
something. >> Um, actually I was

00:19:33.250-->00:19:38.250
gonna to introduce him, should I
- >> You can talk there, we can
hear you. [Pause] >>So there’s

00:19:44.292-->00:19:49.292
[pause], there’s, hi, I am
standing up >> Be nice [Audience
laughs] >> So there’s a, ah a

00:19:52.208-->00:19:57.417
lesser known team at Def Con,
everyone knows that we have our
Red Shirt Goons, they’re visible

00:19:57.417-->00:20:02.417
and you see them all the time
and [Pause and laughter] Um,
there’s, there’s another group

00:20:06.125-->00:20:11.625
here that is sort of a special
operations team. Whereas every
once in awhile we’ll have

00:20:11.625-->00:20:16.875
incidents where maybe somebody
takes offense to something,
somebody did something untoward.

00:20:16.875-->00:20:22.417
Ah you may not feel comfortable
with something and I’ll let him
talk about that. But we do have

00:20:22.417-->00:20:27.417
a team, even where it’s a Goon
or ah, hotel staff, or another
attendee. It doesn’t matter who

00:20:29.833-->00:20:34.833
it is, we have a neutral party
that is not us that we can say
well, our guys didn’t do that or

00:20:37.083-->00:20:41.708
what have you, that you can go
to and you can talk to. And
there are women on his team,

00:20:41.708-->00:20:47.625
there’s a lot of people you feel
comfortable talking to and I’ll
let him talk to you more about

00:20:47.625-->00:20:52.250
that. But this Priest, we just
wanted to let you guys know
because we don’t talk about it

00:20:52.250-->00:20:57.250
and so now’s the chance that we
are. So there you go. [Audience
applauses] >>Welcome to Def Con,

00:21:01.167-->00:21:06.167
can everybody hear me? [Audience
responds] All the way in the
back? Mike up? How’s that, is

00:21:09.000-->00:21:14.333
that better? [Audience claps and
shouts] Okay, so some of you
know who I am, raise your hand

00:21:14.333-->00:21:18.625
if you remember me from the old
days. Okay, so those of you who
don’t know, my handle, is

00:21:18.625-->00:21:23.625
Priest, and I’m the guy you’re
probably going to see right
before you go to jail. And my

00:21:26.333-->00:21:31.917
job is to help you stay out of
trouble, basically. And for the
last several years actually, we

00:21:31.917-->00:21:38.667
we’ve heard you guys talk about
it and we wanted to put together
a team that worked outside of

00:21:38.667-->00:21:42.375
the Goon squad. And by the way
we don’t wear Steeler shirts
we’ll actually wear Goon shirts.

00:21:42.375-->00:21:48.208
I’m gonna have my team, ah my
team come up, half of my team
come up. Gentlemen,[Pause] On

00:21:48.208-->00:21:54.208
stage please. We are here for
you as attendees, like, like
Nikita said if you have a

00:21:54.208-->00:21:59.208
problem with a Goon, you’ve a
problem with the staff, you’ve a
problem with an attendee, we’re

00:22:01.250-->00:22:07.875
here to help you with that and
we’re here to address that. And
we want to make sure that, um;

00:22:07.875-->00:22:11.583
you feel comfortable and safe
talking to us and not have to
worry that there’s some, as they

00:22:11.583-->00:22:17.083
say in the police department,
that the thin blue wall or the
blue wall, does exist. Think of

00:22:17.083-->00:22:22.583
us as internal affairs. So if
someone does something, let us
know. And, ah, like I said, this

00:22:22.583-->00:22:29.083
is about half of my team here,
ah, we want to let you see our
faces, unfortunately one of the

00:22:29.083-->00:22:33.458
women who are on the team, she
cannot show her face, have
pictures taken. But we will let

00:22:33.458-->00:22:38.417
you know we’ve all had diversity
training, we’ve all had sexual
harassment training. All those

00:22:38.417-->00:22:42.250
kinds of trainings where we’re
here to help you make your way
through whatever you need to

00:22:42.250-->00:22:48.708
make your way through and make
sure you have a good convention
experience. Bullying, ah,

00:22:48.708-->00:22:54.333
harassment, not tolerated,
period, full stop. So come let
us know if you want to find one

00:22:54.333-->00:23:00.125
of us go to one the information
booth, grab anybody in a red
shirt, Goon shirt, ask for

00:23:00.125-->00:23:06.167
Priest or one of Priest’s team.
I’m here, I probably sleep about
two hours per night and I’m here

00:23:06.167-->00:23:12.000
98% of the time. So come find us
and we will make sure your
issues are taken care of. And we

00:23:12.000-->00:23:15.625
just want to make sure that
message is getting out, because
it wasn’t getting out. And

00:23:15.625-->00:23:19.500
people were saying well how come
this isn’t happening, well it
has been. As Nikita said, we’ve

00:23:19.500-->00:23:24.542
just kind of kept it behind the
scenes. Also I will probably do
a ‘Spot the Fed’ or two this

00:23:24.542-->00:23:28.333
year, it’s a lot of fun for
those of you who’ve been here
before and saw one. You probably

00:23:28.333-->00:23:34.167
remember it’s where we bring a
Fed up on stage and then I
belittle embarrass them. Um, and

00:23:34.167-->00:23:38.208
do some comedy with them and
they get, the shirts they get
are actually one of the highest

00:23:38.208-->00:23:42.792
sought after shirts where I’ve
seen actual FBI agents, are
there FBI agents in the room?

00:23:42.792-->00:23:47.417
Raise your hand [Audience
laughs] Ah, See, sometimes you
can em, they’re not very bright,

00:23:47.417-->00:23:52.417
you know. [Audience laughs] Ah,
agents will actually steal
shirts from other agents. So if

00:23:54.792-->00:23:58.250
you spot a Fed, you can bring
one forward. If we can do a
‘Spot the Fed’ it’s, it’s kind

00:23:58.250-->00:24:02.208
of a little bit of a, a fun
thing to do while we’re at the
conference, from the old days.

00:24:02.208-->00:24:07.625
That’s all of I’ve got and we’ll
be available and on the floor
from today until Sunday and I

00:24:07.625-->00:24:12.208
guess that you can just come
find us. So everybody have a
great Con, have a great time and

00:24:12.208-->00:24:17.208
we’ll see you on the floor.
[Audience applauses] oh and, I’m
sorry, we have, ah, someone who

00:24:22.083-->00:24:26.167
speaks Spanish, we have someone
who speaks Mandarin, ah we have
someone who speaks some German,

00:24:26.167-->00:24:29.042
so we’ve got some foreign
language coverage as well if
you’re, if you’re not

00:24:29.042-->00:24:32.208
comfortable speaking in the
English language and want to
speak in your own language. So

00:24:32.208-->00:24:37.208
like I said have a great Con
guys. [Audience applauses]
>>Thanks, Priest >>Thanks Priest

00:24:39.583-->00:24:44.583
and it actually is a perfect
Segway. On the back of the
shirts that we threw out, it

00:24:47.333-->00:24:53.792
says this word, courage and you
notice it’s in a rainbow. It’s
not just to celebrate, um, er

00:24:53.792-->00:24:58.792
the, LGBTQ community, it’s also
to >> [Audience member comments]
>>support anybody, any because

00:25:01.708-->00:25:06.708
Def Con has a bad rap and it’s
not, it’s not true. Def Con
supports diversity, Def Con

00:25:08.917-->00:25:15.667
encourages diversity, so you
know this is one of the things
and it, ah, they, is really

00:25:15.667-->00:25:20.083
important to us, especially on
the panel, you know, we want to
make sure that everybody

00:25:20.083-->00:25:25.083
understands. It doesn’t matter
who you are, what, anything you
are. What we care about is you

00:25:28.375-->00:25:35.292
and that’s it. Um, also have the
courage to do the things the,
the double god dare, the triple

00:25:35.292-->00:25:40.417
dog dare that I talked about
before. Hopefully the
introductions that you’ve made,

00:25:40.417-->00:25:46.042
ah, just a little bit ago, will
encourage you guys to, you know,
head on over to the Octavius,

00:25:46.042-->00:25:51.042
for the Noob party, another plug
for free beer. And, you know,
have a, have a beer and talk to

00:25:53.292-->00:25:58.292
each other. [Pause] What I’m
gonna do now is, introduce the
panel, the, we’re gonna talk

00:26:00.917-->00:26:06.625
about, um, our Def Con
experiences, getting involved,
how to get involved with Def

00:26:06.625-->00:26:10.833
Con, a lot of different things.
I’ll introduce each of the
different panel members by their

00:26:10.833-->00:26:15.833
handle and they can tell you if
they wanna give you their real
name. Um, and we’ll take a

00:26:15.833-->00:26:22.042
little bit [Pause] [Audience
member comments] Okay, ah,
actually, for, ah, just a

00:26:22.042-->00:26:27.042
second, we’re gonna bring up the
female staff member of the, um
special teams. [Pause] >>This

00:26:33.167-->00:26:40.042
is, Lady Hydra. Everybody,
here’s Hydra [Audience
applauses] I just wanna warn you

00:26:40.042-->00:26:46.167
all, she looks very innocent,
but in the time it takes you to
say, ‘my god she’s killing me’,

00:26:46.167-->00:26:49.333
she’s already ripped your heart
out and shown it to you.
[Audience laughs] So just be

00:26:49.333-->00:26:53.292
advised. She’s one of our
Mandarin speakers, she’s also
available, to, ah, to assist

00:26:53.292-->00:26:57.625
with any issues that come up,
over what we talked about. So,
again I want you guys to have a

00:26:57.625-->00:27:02.000
face, to go with the
description, just so you know
who you’re talking to. Thank

00:27:02.000-->00:27:07.000
you, sorry about that guys >>
Thank you [Audience applauses]
>>So here’s the panel. Wiseacre,

00:27:13.458-->00:27:18.625
that’s me, um, >> [Audience
member hoots] >> My actual name
is Mike and Mike is a more

00:27:18.625-->00:27:23.625
anonymous name than Wiseacre.
Ah, [Audience laughs] and I got
my handle, um, it was, ah, spoof

00:27:26.292-->00:27:31.292
of an NSAIC program back in
2000. There was a group that was
trying to increase their cyber

00:27:34.542-->00:27:39.333
security and they decided that
they were going to call
themselves, ‘Blackacre’ and the

00:27:39.333-->00:27:45.500
tag was ‘where encryption lives’
and I thought that was the
dumbest thing I’d ever read. So

00:27:45.500-->00:27:51.250
I made ‘Wiseacre’, ‘where the
smartass lives’ [Audience
laughs] because for those of you

00:27:51.250-->00:27:55.167
who don’t know, most people
don’t know what a ‘Wiseacre’ is.
It’s an old word for Smartass.

00:27:55.167-->00:28:00.167
Um, I got involved because of
Roamer, ah, at Def Con. I had
already been coming to Def Con

00:28:03.333-->00:28:08.333
as a participant, doing um
Capture the Flag. I met Alex
Rogan, and um Roamer and the

00:28:12.167-->00:28:17.375
next year because we played
poker together and, and had a
good time, he’s like why don’t

00:28:17.375-->00:28:23.667
you help me out in the vendor
area. And ever since then it’s
been kind of important to me to

00:28:23.667-->00:28:28.667
try and sell this whole idea of,
how much you can get out of Def
Con. Next is Roamer, I’ve

00:28:32.125-->00:28:37.125
already talked about him. We’ve
got Shaggy over here, Malware
Unicorn, Nikita, HighWiz and

00:28:43.083-->00:28:48.083
we’ll shoehorn Alex Rogen in
there. Um, so, I’m gonna go
ahead and introduce Roamer, he’s

00:28:51.167-->00:28:56.167
gonna talk for a little bit and
then I’ll remind him when he’s
done talking. [Pause] >>Alright,

00:28:59.417-->00:29:04.500
listen up you beautiful bitches,
I’m about to f*k you up with
some truth. [Audience hoots and

00:29:04.500-->00:29:09.792
applauses] So, my cast at the
beginning of this how many of
you guys are first time Def Con

00:29:09.792-->00:29:14.250
a ton of people, raise their
hand. How many people, this is
like their fifth Def Con or

00:29:14.250-->00:29:18.625
more? [Audience hoots] Sweet, I
think it’s actually kind of cool
that you guys are here, except

00:29:18.625-->00:29:23.458
for the for the front row
people, those are just my
friends. [Audience laughs] Um,

00:29:23.458-->00:29:28.458
how about 10, nice, sweet, 15?
Nice, ah, so this is my
eighteenth Def Con and every

00:29:33.417-->00:29:38.333
year I wonder why the f*k I do
this. Um, this is believe it
not, this is actually one of my

00:29:38.333-->00:29:44.250
second time attending Def Con.
The other 16 times that I was
here, ah, I worked as a Goon and

00:29:44.250-->00:29:50.958
then as of last year, retired.
And actually realized Def Con’s
a lot of fun, something I had

00:29:50.958-->00:29:56.917
not recognized before that so
it’s kind of fun being one of
you guys for a while. Um, you

00:29:56.917-->00:30:00.875
know, I really hadn’t thought a
lot about what I was gonna say
up here and then Mike kind of

00:30:00.875-->00:30:07.125
talked for a minute about, um,
hacking the conference and I
think that’s probably when I

00:30:07.125-->00:30:13.917
was, came up with the idea of
doing Def Con 101. Ah what, 8
years ago? >> 9 >>9 years ago, I

00:30:13.917-->00:30:18.833
thought it was the dumbest idea
I had ever heard of in my life.
I’m like; why in the world would

00:30:18.833-->00:30:22.667
you have to tell people how to
hack a conference? If they’re,
if you have to do that then

00:30:22.667-->00:30:27.417
they’re clearly at the wrong
conference. And it took me
awhile in coming and actually

00:30:27.417-->00:30:32.750
watching this panel to kind of
understand what he was doing and
realize that it really does make

00:30:32.750-->00:30:36.958
a lot of sense and we can kinda
help you guys, make, not make
some of the dumb mistakes that

00:30:36.958-->00:30:42.000
we did when we first started
coming here. Um, but the big one
that Mike talked about is, is

00:30:42.000-->00:30:48.833
hacking the conference and, you
know I guess I’ll kind of tell
you guys a story from a few

00:30:48.833-->00:30:52.292
years ago when I first started,
I was, ah working on a security
team and then I ran the vendor

00:30:52.292-->00:30:57.292
area for 12 years? Yeah 12 years
and then um, in that time frame
I also ran, ah what, was

00:31:02.125-->00:31:05.750
probably the precursor to like
what’s the Wireless Village now,
but it was basically just the

00:31:05.750-->00:31:10.250
War driving contest and the War
driving contest, and remember
this is like a long ass time ago

00:31:10.250-->00:31:16.000
when War driving was actually
something that was useful to do.
Um, but it was one of these

00:31:16.000-->00:31:19.750
things that we were just kinda
talking on IRC and said hey, we
should actually do that. We got

00:31:19.750-->00:31:25.000
DT to kina sign off on it and
did it. And the one thing that I
did for the years that I ran it

00:31:25.000-->00:31:30.458
was, I always said that, you
know, I had very, very minimal,
very sparse rules on what ah,

00:31:30.458-->00:31:35.917
people could or couldn’t do.
And, ah basically the scoring
format and then I always said if

00:31:35.917-->00:31:41.125
it’s not specifically forbidden
then it’s allowed. And that,
like brought some of the coolest

00:31:41.125-->00:31:47.167
stuff that I’d ever seen on that
contest. Like the first year,
um, the Spoon group guys came up

00:31:47.167-->00:31:50.667
to me and they were like, hey
it’s the War driving contest,
but do we actually have to

00:31:50.667-->00:31:56.208
drive? And I’m like; I don’t
know what else do you want to
do? And they had a really cool

00:31:56.208-->00:32:00.958
idea, since, ah since you got
unique points for every access
or you got extra points for

00:32:00.958-->00:32:06.500
every unique access point you
found that no other team did.
Um, they contacted one of the

00:32:06.500-->00:32:10.583
local news stations and said
hey, we can give you an
exclusive on this, on this War

00:32:10.583-->00:32:14.250
driving thing, if you’ll fly us
around in your helicopters so
that we could actually pick up

00:32:14.250-->00:32:19.250
access points. [Audience laughs
and claps] Is, they won, um
[Audience laughs] and then, so

00:32:21.250-->00:32:26.250
then the next year, oh my god,
you can’t fly. Um, added that
rule in, then, um one of the

00:32:29.542-->00:32:34.542
guys came up to me and he’s
like, I was reading through the
rules and nowhere in there does

00:32:34.542-->00:32:41.375
it say it has to be Vegas. I was
like, sh*t you’re right, it
doesn’t [Audience laughs] so is

00:32:41.375-->00:32:47.000
it cool if I drive to L.A.? And
I’m like, I don’t give a sh*t,
if you wanna drive to L.A., more

00:32:47.000-->00:32:52.958
power to ya, sucks getting from
here to there. Um, but they did
and so one guy from the, ah,

00:32:52.958-->00:32:57.042
from the Wiggle Team drove all
the way to L.A. all of his
access points were unique and

00:32:57.042-->00:33:02.417
they won. And um, it was kind of
weird, I was telling this exact
same story last year, cause

00:33:02.417-->00:33:08.333
really like repeating myself,
it’s a lot of fun. Um, and like
there’s this girl freaking out

00:33:08.333-->00:33:12.250
like in the third row or
something like that. She’s like
doing this sh*t and I’m like,

00:33:12.250-->00:33:17.625
what the hell’s going on, so
afterward she comes up and she’s
like, ‘Dude that was my Dad that

00:33:17.625-->00:33:22.250
drove all the way from here to
L.A.’ I’m like that’s amazing,
I’m f*king old. [Audience

00:33:22.250-->00:33:27.250
laughs] So, that thing happened
and I am old, which is cool, um,
you know one of [laughs] one of

00:33:34.208-->00:33:38.083
the things that, that you’re
gonna see is a lot of the staff
that have been here, have been

00:33:38.083-->00:33:43.000
doin’ this for, a really long
time. You’ll see several of the
people with the 15 year Goon

00:33:43.000-->00:33:47.083
badges, ah, several of the
retired people which is a lot
more of us now than there used

00:33:47.083-->00:33:50.333
to be. You can tell the
difference between a regular
Goon and a retired Goon, by the

00:33:50.333-->00:33:55.417
retired Goon’s actually smiling.
Um [Audience laughs] But, you
know, one of the things that we

00:33:55.417-->00:33:59.458
always try to do whether it was
with the Vendor or whether it
was the contest, whether it was

00:33:59.458-->00:34:06.375
anything, was to try to give you
guys an opportunity to do the
sh*t that you wanna do that the

00:34:06.375-->00:34:11.500
rest of society may think is
stupid. Or they may think it’s
illegal, yeh, yeh. I know, like

00:34:11.500-->00:34:15.542
it was really weird when we were
doin’ the War driving contest,
there was a time that I, ah,

00:34:15.542-->00:34:19.417
used to work for the government,
it was really shitty. Um, but
there was a time when I both had

00:34:19.417-->00:34:24.625
a security clearance and I was
the, ah subject of an active FBI
investigation. Because we

00:34:24.625-->00:34:29.458
decided to, run, ah, yeah some
more driving stuff, so that was
cool. Didn’t f*k my clearance up

00:34:29.458-->00:34:35.917
at all. [Audience laughs] Um,
yeah, I want you guys to like
ah, you gonna hear, this, a lot

00:34:35.917-->00:34:39.583
of the same crap, because I’m
not the only person that likes
repeating myself they do too,

00:34:39.583-->00:34:43.417
but you’re gonna hear people
tell you to get involved and if
there’s one thing that I can’t,

00:34:43.417-->00:34:47.958
can’t stress enough it’s that.
Ah, when I first started coming
to Def Con, there were, I don’t

00:34:47.958-->00:34:54.333
know, like 2000 people here.
Something like that, maybe more.
Ah, hmm >> [Audience member

00:34:54.333-->00:34:59.667
comments] >>Dude, I’m not like
90 [Audience laughs] But anyway,
that how many there were,

00:34:59.667-->00:35:05.208
alright so there were like 600
people at Def Con then. Um, and
so, it was really cool because

00:35:05.208-->00:35:10.250
it was in Alexis Park and it was
really small, and it wasn’t here
and it was off the strip so

00:35:10.250-->00:35:13.708
there weren’t a lot of the
f*king rules that you guys are
running into know, that can, you

00:35:13.708-->00:35:18.208
know, that can kinda, tend to
make your fun less fun. But it
was great because you could just

00:35:18.208-->00:35:23.083
walk out to the pool and you
would hear conversations going
on, and you were like dude, I

00:35:23.083-->00:35:26.417
would like to be a part of that
conversation. I’m gonna go and
get some beer and see if I can

00:35:26.417-->00:35:32.333
bribe them into letting me talk
to them. And so I can to my
first Def Con, 18 years ago, ah,

00:35:32.333-->00:35:38.250
knowing exactly one person and
that was Russ Rogers and Russ ,
um, is the kinda dude that likes

00:35:38.250-->00:35:43.250
to go to bed at like, I don’t
know, 6pm or some sh*t [Audience
laughs] So you know. Basically

00:35:43.250-->00:35:47.583
from the time normal people are
having dinner, for the rest of
the night I was kinda on my own.

00:35:47.583-->00:35:51.917
And Def Con was a great place
because you could just walk up
to people and start talking and

00:35:51.917-->00:35:55.292
as long as you’re following
Mike’s, don’t be a dick rule
that would usually work out

00:35:55.292-->00:36:01.083
pretty well for you. Um, I will
tell if you’re a dick; you’re
going to be exposed as such. If

00:36:01.083-->00:36:04.792
you start trying to pretend that
you know sh*t you don’t know,
you’re probably talking to the

00:36:04.792-->00:36:08.958
author of the tool that you’re
pretending you’re an expert on.
[Audience laughs] I’ve literally

00:36:08.958-->00:36:14.458
seen it happen, and it’s
glorious when it does. [Audience
laughs] Um, you know, take this;

00:36:14.458-->00:36:17.583
take the opportunity to get
involved with these things.
Mike, went through like the

00:36:17.583-->00:36:22.167
entire list of a jillion
villages, I thought it was some
Forest Gump sh*t there for a

00:36:22.167-->00:36:27.792
sec., you know. Hardware Hacking
Village, Lockpick Village,
[Audience laughs], ICS Village,

00:36:27.792-->00:36:33.333
a lot of Villages, but go to em
and actually like participate.
When I started here, those

00:36:33.333-->00:36:37.958
weren’t a thing that you could
do; participation was maybe
hanging out at the pool with

00:36:37.958-->00:36:41.833
your laptop if you actually had
one, because it was probably one
of those big thick Toshiba,

00:36:41.833-->00:36:47.417
mother f*ckers that [Audience
laughs] Um, but you know
literally when I started coming

00:36:47.417-->00:36:52.125
here the halls in the Alexis
Park were lined with people’s
desktops that they brought from

00:36:52.125-->00:36:55.792
home. Cause nobody had laptops,
that’s for rich mother F*ckers
right there [audience comments]

00:36:55.792-->00:37:02.417
so, um, you know if you take the
opportunity to get involved,
you’re gonna find that people

00:37:02.417-->00:37:06.125
are gonna be very responsive to
that. If you come into
everything that you’re doing

00:37:06.125-->00:37:09.833
without an ego, I know you
mother f*ckers have ego’s,
because I’m used to being the

00:37:09.833-->00:37:13.875
smartest mother F*cker in the
room too. Alright, so I’ve seen
the way you act when you come in

00:37:13.875-->00:37:16.667
and act like you know
everything, the chances are
you’re really do not know

00:37:16.667-->00:37:21.000
anywhere near as much as you
think you do. So actually listen
to the people that are giving

00:37:21.000-->00:37:25.708
the talks, listen to the people
that are doin’, and like, um,
Mike said, if you think that the

00:37:25.708-->00:37:30.625
speaker’s wrong about something,
trying to embarrass the speaker
onstage is not going to go very

00:37:30.625-->00:37:35.000
far. There is a lot of better
ways to address that and the
speaker’s probably gonna be

00:37:35.000-->00:37:40.500
actually appreciative of being
handled in a proper way. But if
you try and just like humiliate

00:37:40.500-->00:37:45.167
him on stage then they’ll
probably get pissed and scream
at you and sh*t. So, anyway that

00:37:45.167-->00:37:51.375
is about all my time, I don’t
have a ton so I will turn it
over, I believe to Shaggy next,

00:37:51.375-->00:37:56.375
alright. Thank you very much.
[Audience applause] >> Are you,
are you finally done talking?

00:38:05.208-->00:38:10.208
[Laughter] Alright, ah, I’m
Shaggy, ah, I got introduced in
Def Con, ah, at 18, um.

00:38:13.333-->00:38:19.333
Everyone’s Noob’s here, which is
good. Cause we need Noob’s,
Wiseacre is gonna die, Roamer is

00:38:19.333-->00:38:24.208
gonna die, people need to take
their positions and do things
and need to learn. So don’t feel

00:38:24.208-->00:38:29.042
bad about being a Noob. Ah,
there’s tons of things to do at
[member comments] Def Con, hmm?

00:38:29.042-->00:38:35.125
Yeah. Ah, go to the contests and
events, ah, was a Goon there for
a while, um, there’s tons of

00:38:35.125-->00:38:40.375
cool contests and events.
There’s gonna be lots of lines,
we know that. Don’t stand in

00:38:40.375-->00:38:44.625
line and bitch about the line,
stand in the line and talk to
someone else in the line, to

00:38:44.625-->00:38:48.375
learn something. Because the guy
sitting next you probably knows
something that you don’t know

00:38:48.375-->00:38:54.708
and vice versa. So try make, ah,
relationships with people and
really just have fun. Um, I’m

00:38:54.708-->00:38:58.750
not going to really tell too
many stories, ‘cause I’m not as
good as Roamer, but I’ll, ah

00:38:58.750-->00:39:03.750
tell one. My first Def Con I was
at a bar, which happens in Vegas
and someone was talking about

00:39:05.875-->00:39:10.375
something and I was kinda new
and stuff so, I just was nodding
along, like, yeah I know what

00:39:10.375-->00:39:14.500
he’s talking about. I had no
F*cking clue what they were
talking about. And instead of

00:39:14.500-->00:39:19.792
just asking them, like oh can
you explain that, I looked like
an idiot just going, yeah,

00:39:19.792-->00:39:23.417
[Audience laughs] I know that
man. I did not know sh*t and I
honestly even can’t remember

00:39:23.417-->00:39:26.917
what they were talking about
cause I didn’t ask them about
it. So, that’s probably the

00:39:26.917-->00:39:32.083
worst thing that you can do. I’m
like Roamer’s said, don’t try to
bullsh*t people, if you try to

00:39:32.083-->00:39:36.958
bullsh*t someone you will be
called out and you’re gonna feel
like sh*t. So, don’t do that.

00:39:36.958-->00:39:42.417
Um, and yeah, just have fun,
enjoy yourself. I keep like
hearing this weird echo, it’s

00:39:42.417-->00:39:47.417
weird, okay. >>You have got two
mike’s on >>What? Oh, okay, ah,
but yeah, have fun and enjoy Def

00:39:53.833-->00:39:58.833
Con. Have a good one. [Audience
applauses] >>Hey everyone, ah,
I’m Alex Shogren or just my

00:40:01.792-->00:40:06.750
name’s Aaron as well. Ah, I
wormed my way up on stage. I’ve
done a couple of these before,

00:40:06.750-->00:40:11.458
took a couple of years off,
then, ah, probably going be
retiring, ah with Roamer at the

00:40:11.458-->00:40:16.375
end of this Con. So, I figured,
eh, one more, sure it’s not
good. Ah, I’ve been coming to

00:40:16.375-->00:40:21.750
Def Con since Def Con 10, um,
myself, my buddy Tim and his
wife Derra back there. Ah, we

00:40:21.750-->00:40:27.625
were some of the people that
tormented Roamer and Russ on IRC
prior to the Def Con 10 wireless

00:40:27.625-->00:40:33.417
competition. Ah, and really got
him pissed off and so that was
my introduction to Def Con, was

00:40:33.417-->00:40:36.875
showing up with this guy I’ve
been pissing off for the last
three or four months, who

00:40:36.875-->00:40:42.333
changes his avatar to a middle
finger on the Forums because of
it, so, you know, lots of fun

00:40:42.333-->00:40:46.750
times. Ah, he ended up asking me
to help out in the Vendor area.
I’ve been working in the Vendor

00:40:46.750-->00:40:52.500
area since, ah, Def Con 13? 12,
13? Anyway, um, the cool thing
about participation that

00:40:52.500-->00:40:57.458
everybody’s been talking about
is that, ah, you never know
what’s gonna happen. You know,

00:40:57.458-->00:41:00.708
go back to the Forest Gump
thing, ‘you never know what
you’re gonna get’ ah, every,

00:41:00.708-->00:41:05.708
every Con I, ah I’ve, ah
attended, I’ve ended up talking
to people one on one. Somebody

00:41:07.833-->00:41:11.708
stops you in the hallways,
somebody kinda has that
questioning look in their eyes

00:41:11.708-->00:41:14.917
when they pass by you and
sometimes you just kinda stop
and say, hey can I help out,

00:41:14.917-->00:41:19.375
what’s, you know, what’s goin’
on? Ah, I was asked one year,
ah, while waiting for the Vendor

00:41:19.375-->00:41:24.292
area to open, this guy walks in
and says, hey, I heard about
this ah, this party, this Ninja

00:41:24.292-->00:41:29.375
Networks party. And this was at,
this was at Def Con 20, this was
the last of the Ninja Networks

00:41:29.375-->00:41:34.667
party. He goes how, how can I
get in? I, I wanna get in I’m
sure a lot of you here have

00:41:34.667-->00:41:38.292
heard about different parties
that happen during CON and
there’s different ways to get

00:41:38.292-->00:41:42.583
in. I said hey, I said, well I
can introduce you to a couple of
guys that are a part of Ninja

00:41:42.583-->00:41:46.333
Network. So they’re not gonna
give you a badge, but you can
talk to them or you can talk to

00:41:46.333-->00:41:51.833
people that they’re talking to
and figure out, you know. You
know something I’m sure you’re,

00:41:51.833-->00:41:55.667
you’re here you have some kind
of skills, so talk to the
people. And he’s like alright

00:41:55.667-->00:41:58.958
yeh man, that’s cool and I was
like okay, cool just having a
conversation. That was, that was

00:41:58.958-->00:42:03.667
Friday morning that was, that
was the first opening of the
Vendor area. Sunday comes along

00:42:03.667-->00:42:08.500
we’re all dead tired, we’re last
day of the CON, we’re draggin’.
This guy comes and finds me in

00:42:08.500-->00:42:11.833
the Vendor area and I was like
hey, [stutters] to see you, he’s
like, yeh, yeh, yeh. You know,

00:42:11.833-->00:42:14.958
talked to you on Friday and I
said, okay cool. I said what
about it? HE said, the Ninja

00:42:14.958-->00:42:19.542
Networks thing, I said, oh cool,
how’d it go? He said, hey I got
in I got the badge and I got all

00:42:19.542-->00:42:23.667
the cool stuff and I got to
meet, you know, ah, you know,
Darkcode and everybody else and

00:42:23.667-->00:42:28.875
had a great time. And I was
like, Dude, that is so awesome
and just, you know, out of the

00:42:28.875-->00:42:34.375
blue. So fast forward to last
night, ah we were doin’ some of
the pre-vendor area set up, and

00:42:34.375-->00:42:38.792
I was walking back and I think I
hit, um, I don’t know 20 000
steps yesterday, I don’t know

00:42:38.792-->00:42:43.250
what it was. But there was a guy
that stopped me in the hallway,
again questioning look, and he

00:42:43.250-->00:42:49.000
had a little piece of plastic
card out and he had a little
like, like a mole skin, kinda

00:42:49.000-->00:42:53.667
reporter like cops notebook. You
know he was scribbling stuff
down in it. And he had, ah,

00:42:53.667-->00:42:58.750
Caesars challenge badge and
little translucent plastic with
a whole bunch of little six

00:42:58.750-->00:43:03.917
sided dice on em in various
order. So, you know and numbers
one through six and he had, he

00:43:03.917-->00:43:07.542
had, he had, written out, he
had, you know, recorded all of
them down, and he had gone

00:43:07.542-->00:43:10.542
through and he was trying to do
numeric substitution, trying to
figure out how to crack the

00:43:10.542-->00:43:14.958
cypher. And he goes, hey, do you
have any advice? Well I, I, I’m
not a crypto person and I don’t

00:43:14.958-->00:43:19.333
know anything about that but I
do remember reading stuff about,
oh well, you know how many

00:43:19.333-->00:43:24.042
across? Oh, there’s ten, ten
numbers across and I said, okay.
Start breaking em up, I think

00:43:24.042-->00:43:28.292
maybe if you put em in groups of
five or something you can start
doin’ substitutions, I don’t

00:43:28.292-->00:43:31.833
know. Again, you can tell I
don’t know crypto, but you know
it was like somthin’ like

00:43:31.833-->00:43:36.417
[inaudible] Oh and he was
talking to a guy that had like a
cube badge around his neck and

00:43:36.417-->00:43:40.000
so he was like, cube and block,
he goes, maybe there’s somethin’
there and I go, block cypher or

00:43:40.000-->00:43:44.125
something and said, I don’t know
hey. Sounds good, you know, like
run with it and like he just

00:43:44.125-->00:43:48.542
like, you could, you could see
the light bulb go off in his
head. He had started, clicked

00:43:48.542-->00:43:52.917
onto something and was like, I
am so excited, he was saying,
you know, I’m actually leaving

00:43:52.917-->00:43:59.750
out Saturday even if I get this
on, I can’t make the party, but
I wanna figure this out. And so,

00:43:59.750-->00:44:03.625
just random people in the
hallway when you’re in the lines
with them, when you’re in

00:44:03.625-->00:44:09.542
workshops and stuff just talk to
people. Reach out to them, ah,
you’re gonna get so much more

00:44:09.542-->00:44:15.833
back when you do and don’t let
the whole concept of being a
Noob, being a first time

00:44:15.833-->00:44:22.458
attendee, shame you in any way.
Every one of us up here on stage
has been a Noob. I’m still a

00:44:22.458-->00:44:27.875
Noob, I’ve been doin’ stuff for
22 years for goodness sake, I
know nothing. I’m John Snow and

00:44:27.875-->00:44:32.542
know nothing about this sh*t
sometimes, but you know,
[stutters] come on you know

00:44:32.542-->00:44:37.208
this >> still f*cken talkin >>
I’m sorry. Oh, yeah, my time is
up. So anyway, I’m Alex,

00:44:37.208-->00:44:42.208
everybody have a great time,
thanks. [Audience applauses]
>>Are you looking at me? >> I’m

00:44:47.500-->00:44:53.125
gonna introduce you to the
newest member of our family.
[Pause] Malware Unicorn, this is

00:44:53.125-->00:44:57.750
the first year she’s done this.
She’s gonna tell you a little
bit about what she, ah, does and

00:44:57.750-->00:45:02.750
how she has a good time. [Pause]
[Audience applauses] >>Yeah, so,
I’ve been goin’ to Def Con on my

00:45:07.625-->00:45:12.542
own dime for several years now,
and you know this is the only
place where I get to see people

00:45:12.542-->00:45:17.583
once a year from all over the
world, all over the country. And
we get to just nerd out about

00:45:17.583-->00:45:23.208
stuff like malware, obviously,
Malware Unicorn, right. Um, and
and I can sit there having a

00:45:23.208-->00:45:28.500
drink at like a club or a bar
and we can just talk about, oh,
what would be your most awesome

00:45:28.500-->00:45:34.000
malware you would develop? Like
well I’ll tell you my points and
you could tell me your points

00:45:34.000-->00:45:39.750
and we can, you know come
together and make something
cool. But, you know, this is, I

00:45:39.750-->00:45:45.583
wanted to give back to the
community by being involved and
trying to get more diversity

00:45:45.583-->00:45:51.917
into Def Con. Ah, there’s so
many Villages out there, there’s
so many niche, niche’s out there

00:45:51.917-->00:45:56.917
that you can find your passion.
Um, but, I’ll tell ya if, if you
come up to a girl that looks

00:46:00.000-->00:46:05.958
like me, make sure you call out
there name before touch them
[Laughs] I’ve had so many times

00:46:05.958-->00:46:10.958
with people tapping on the
shoulder and they’ll like be, oh
sh*t, but um, yeah just just be

00:46:10.958-->00:46:16.875
kind you know. Not everybody
knows you’re Twitter handle or
you’re handle or your name. Um,

00:46:16.875-->00:46:22.875
just be cordial like you would
in a business situation. Um,
we’re all here for the same

00:46:22.875-->00:46:28.958
reasons, there’s no reason to
shame people in public you could
do that offline, in a hotel room

00:46:28.958-->00:46:33.958
somewhere. Um, [Laughs] But, ah,
but enjoy Def Con [stutters] I
mean there’s so many things to

00:46:37.292-->00:46:42.292
learn, malware reverse
engineering which is what I do.
Ah, there’s exploit development,

00:46:44.292-->00:46:49.292
there’s so many good talks out
there and I hope you guys enjoy
this year. Thanks. [Audience

00:46:54.833-->00:46:59.292
applauses] >>You’re not gonna
mention that you are newly added
to the Def Con CFP Review Board?

00:47:01.500-->00:47:06.375
[Pause] [Laughter] >> She has
been >>Strangely enough most of
the people here >>Great >> are

00:47:06.375-->00:47:11.375
also on the Call For Paper’s
Review Board. So next, when we
talk about Def Con, for most

00:47:15.542-->00:47:21.750
people Def Con happens through
magic. Um, everything just
happens, you see a bunch of guys

00:47:21.750-->00:47:25.542
with red shirts and they’re
directing you to different
places. You see guys in red

00:47:25.542-->00:47:30.875
shirts introducing the speakers,
you see guys in red shirts, and
women in red shirts, sorry. Um,

00:47:30.875-->00:47:37.250
you know, basically doin’
whatever and you don’t probably
think how did all of this come

00:47:37.250-->00:47:42.250
together? [Pause] Nikita, Nikita
is one of the full time
employees for Def Con and she is

00:47:44.542-->00:47:50.250
the one that make the magic
happen. So that, you know, I’d
like, ah, Nikita to take a

00:47:50.250-->00:47:57.167
little bit of time to talk about
her wonderfulness. [Pause]
>>Honestly I thought I was just

00:47:57.167-->00:48:02.167
going to be on the panel to make
jokes. [Audience applauses]
Thank you for the applause, I

00:48:10.167-->00:48:15.167
appreciate that, um, I do this
for you guys. It’s the only
reason why I’m committed to

00:48:19.875-->00:48:26.125
working the long hours, and, ah,
month that I put into it, but
it’s worth it. Um, I didn’t

00:48:26.125-->00:48:29.417
really expect to talk [Laughs]
because I thought we were just
gonna sit up here and crack

00:48:29.417-->00:48:34.417
jokes, but that’s okay [Laughs].
Um, [Pause] we’ve talked about a
lot of stuff about, um, being

00:48:37.792-->00:48:44.125
open, asking questions. Um,
don’t try to bluff your way
through a conversation, you are

00:48:44.125-->00:48:48.917
with people who are smart, ask
them the question. But one thing
I did want to say is, don’t have

00:48:48.917-->00:48:54.000
a, I read this in the NOC today.
Don’t have strong opinions about
things you don’t fully

00:48:54.000-->00:48:59.750
understand [Laughs] and be
willing to keep an open mind and
talk to the other people about

00:48:59.750-->00:49:05.167
it. You know, you can’t just say
like, oh well, social
engineering is completely sh*t.

00:49:05.167-->00:49:10.167
Well, no it’s not, you know, or
this is useless ah, information
or you shouldn’t have your phone

00:49:14.458-->00:49:20.375
you, you should have a burner
phone. It’s like, you know,
everybody’s security risks are

00:49:20.375-->00:49:26.917
different and if you can’t go to
Starbucks with their phone and
come to Def Con, you need to

00:49:26.917-->00:49:31.917
adjust your settings either way.
They both public, so I don’t
know what else to say [Laughs]

00:49:34.708-->00:49:39.333
[Pause] Does anybody wanna ask
me something, I don’t
know?[Laughs] >> Why don’t you

00:49:39.333-->00:49:44.417
tell us about some of the things
you do to get ready for this
stuff? >>Oh, thank you, that’s a

00:49:44.417-->00:49:49.792
really good question. He asked
me to say what I do to get ready
for this event. Um >>Everything

00:49:49.792-->00:49:56.000
>> Yeah, she does everything.
>>Everything, [Laughs] no I’m
joking, um, I help ah,

00:49:56.000-->00:50:02.750
coordinate the floor plan, I
help the speakers, I get them
scheduled. I run the Def Con CFP

00:50:02.750-->00:50:07.750
review board. I process all the
speakers, the workshops, I help
>>[Inaudible] can I interrupt

00:50:11.958-->00:50:17.542
you for just a second >>Go
ahead, please >>Um, It is
difficult to describe what an

00:50:17.542-->00:50:24.083
amazing job she does on the CFP
board. Um, this is, we have
what, almost 600 submissions

00:50:24.083-->00:50:30.875
this year? Ah, of which what we
accepted 100 and something
[Pause] >> Yeah, roughly a

00:50:30.875-->00:50:36.708
little over 100 >>She wrote
specific feedback to every
rejected talk and sent it to

00:50:36.708-->00:50:40.750
every one of those, ah
submitters. No other conference
does that, no other, because no

00:50:40.750-->00:50:45.750
other person is you. You’re the
only person, that’s insane
enough to do that. So, yeah,

00:50:45.750-->00:50:50.750
seriously [Audience applauses]
Thank you. >>Thank you. I have
an assistant know, so I do have

00:50:54.625-->00:51:00.375
a little bit of help with that.
Leah, she can’t be here, cause
we’re both pregnant [Laughs] at

00:51:00.375-->00:51:06.500
the same time. Um, I decided to
come, but ah, she you know
couldn’t and that’s fine, you

00:51:06.500-->00:51:12.667
know. It’s cool, I miss her a
lot, but, um, one of the things
the CFP review board does do is

00:51:12.667-->00:51:17.667
the feedback. Um, if you are
even remotely hesitant about
submitting a talk, please just

00:51:19.958-->00:51:26.750
submit it anyway. Um, the worst
thing that can happen, is we say
no and we tell you why, and that

00:51:26.750-->00:51:31.750
is gonna be some invaluable
information to you from a team
of incredibly smart people, that

00:51:33.833-->00:51:39.083
just blow my mind at how
brilliant they are. And they
process all of the reviews, they

00:51:39.083-->00:51:44.250
read them all, they put their
heart and soul into it, to pick
the best talks. And if something

00:51:44.250-->00:51:49.458
just doesn’t fit right, it just
doesn’t fit right, but you could
take that to another Con, you

00:51:49.458-->00:51:55.125
can build your speaking career.
You can build upon that talk and
even in some cases, while this

00:51:55.125-->00:52:00.208
isn’t quite Def Con, but why
don’t you consider reaching out
to the speaker or why don’t you

00:52:00.208-->00:52:05.208
consider this avenue and that is
how people grow in their, their
data and grow in what they ah,

00:52:08.500-->00:52:14.500
what their project is and helped
evolve it. So, ah, it’s always
worth it submitting. If you

00:52:14.500-->00:52:20.750
think you’re not good enough,
you’re wrong, it’s just dumb,
just submit it. This year, six,

00:52:20.750-->00:52:25.750
over sixty per, sixty, sixty one
or sixty something plus talks
were first time Def Con

00:52:28.333-->00:52:33.333
speakers. And they’re not like
super elite rock stars that
everybody’s afraid to talk to;

00:52:35.375-->00:52:39.208
they are people just like you.
And even those super elite rock
stars, I’ve read, you’re afraid

00:52:39.208-->00:52:45.250
to talk to, they’re just people
like you. They’re here at Def
Con because this is Def Con;

00:52:45.250-->00:52:50.250
it’s a, it’s a family reunion
for most of us. Um [Pause] yeah,
I don’t what else to say but

00:52:53.875-->00:52:58.875
that [Laughs] I really hate
speaking [Audience applauses]
Thank you guys. [Applause]

00:53:04.958-->00:53:11.750
>>Alright, the ah the ah, best
has been saved for last. And
it’s because Highwiz started

00:53:11.750-->00:53:16.750
this ah, nine years ago, the
idea of, ah, Def Con 101 and it
has grown into this. And I get

00:53:19.417-->00:53:25.875
to speak because; while I have
social anxiety I also like the
sound of my voice. Um [Audience

00:53:25.875-->00:53:30.625
laughs] but the reality is we
work together and we have the
same ideas and and ah, Highwiz

00:53:30.625-->00:53:36.125
has a great deal of
participation. In fact he
organized um, and worked with

00:53:36.125-->00:53:41.125
Nikita on which talks went where
and [stutters] the 101 ah track,
so, um, you wanna talk? You got

00:53:45.042-->00:53:50.042
visual aids? >>I got those. I’m
gonna put my sunglasses on cause
these lights are really f*ckin

00:53:52.042-->00:53:59.000
bright. [Pause] So, I’m the
token homosexual of the panel,
ah speaking of, [Audience

00:53:59.000-->00:54:05.625
applauses] if there are any hot
single guys out there, holler at
me, okay. Ah, I’m not gonna tell

00:54:05.625-->00:54:10.125
ya to get involved because
everyone else did, I’m gonna
give some shout outs though.

00:54:10.125-->00:54:16.875
First is to Lost, ah, Lost was a
long time panellist of Def Con
101, this is his first year not

00:54:16.875-->00:54:21.875
here, um, he, he’s at home, he
has some family issues. So he
designed the badges for years

00:54:24.292-->00:54:29.167
and I’d like everyone to give a
round of applause to Lost,
alright. [Audience applauses]

00:54:29.167-->00:54:34.167
Speaking of badges though,
[Pause] how awesome are these?
What do you guys think?

00:54:40.208-->00:54:45.208
[Audience applauses] because you
know who designed the badges
this year? You know who designed

00:54:47.292-->00:54:53.000
them? [Pause] Nikita and her
husband Neil, so can we give a
round of applause for these

00:54:53.000-->00:54:58.000
awesome badges [Audience
applauses] If you’re gay, if
you’re straight, welcome to Def

00:55:03.958-->00:55:10.292
Con. If you’re gay, go to
Queercon, ah QueerCon’s awesome
they have a pool party tomorrow

00:55:10.292-->00:55:17.000
night, it’s at the Palms this
year, ah, there’s a shuttle bus
from here, so go to it. Lots of

00:55:17.000-->00:55:22.000
hot guys and girls and a pool,
um, people of all colors. Ah,
the scavenger hunt is probably

00:55:24.208-->00:55:30.917
the best contest, if you are a
Noob, hands down. Ah, unlike
most people on the panel, I

00:55:30.917-->00:55:37.500
actually have a real earned
Black badge; I did that at the
scavenger hunt, alright.

00:55:37.500-->00:55:42.333
[Laughter] And that was not
directed at you, I said people
on the panel here >>Ah, I’m not

00:55:42.333-->00:55:47.333
on the panel [Laughter] >>So, I,
ah you get a Black badge if you
win, hopefully this year, maybe.

00:55:50.083-->00:55:55.083
Um, no, DT totally said you
would. Ah, so [Pause] he, he’s
the one that decides and it’s

00:55:57.125-->00:56:01.458
usually right before the event,
but if I guess I say it on
camera, maybe it has to become

00:56:01.458-->00:56:06.875
true. So, um, do the scavenger
hunt, it gets you out there. It
gets you involved getting to

00:56:06.875-->00:56:11.875
meet people. Um, all year round,
ah, there’s a Def Con
sub-reddit, ah, slash r Def Con.

00:56:14.250-->00:56:19.458
How many reditter’s here can I
see a show of hands. [Audience
hoots] Alright, alright, how are

00:56:19.458-->00:56:24.458
you guys not on our Def Con,
come on, you gotta do it. Let’s
see, besides that, the Security

00:56:26.750-->00:56:33.542
Tribe, so most of the people on
this panel are in a group I
belong to, called Security

00:56:33.542-->00:56:40.417
Tribe. And I probably owe them
more than anybody else for Def
Con 101 happening. So, we’re

00:56:40.417-->00:56:46.458
looking for new members, so if
you want to become a Def Con,
um, well Security Tribe member,

00:56:46.458-->00:56:51.500
come up to us, the Noob party.
Ah, hang out with us and maybe
we’ll make you, a member of our

00:56:51.500-->00:56:58.250
hacker group. Um, I just want to
thank everyone for coming up
here and doing the panel with

00:56:58.250-->00:57:03.250
me. Um, I’m always awe inspired
by these super awesome and smart
people who basically come out to

00:57:07.000-->00:57:12.833
support me and support you guys,
support all the Noobs. Um, and
thank you all for coming, so

00:57:12.833-->00:57:17.833
give yourselves a round of
applause for or coming.
[Audience applauses] >>How many

00:57:25.667-->00:57:31.917
of you had heard of the 101
panel before coming? [Pause]
>>Oh >> Not very many of you

00:57:31.917-->00:57:36.875
>>Wow >>We’d like to play a
game, besides throwing out
t-shirts. We play a game called,

00:57:36.875-->00:57:41.875
‘Name that Noob’. Now, we talked
about or I talked about
everybody’s handle. Um, handle’s

00:57:45.875-->00:57:51.375
should be earned, a lot of
people have their own handle and
they think it’s fun, like, I’m

00:57:51.375-->00:57:56.375
Eldrich or you know, I’m, ah,
Rogue Tracker. Um.. >> Morpheus
>> But the reality is, a, a

00:57:59.083-->00:58:04.458
handle that’s earned is a handle
that sticks with you and it’s a
handle that’s fun. Um, for those

00:58:04.458-->00:58:10.208
of you who don’t know what a
handle is, I’m sorry. [Laughter]
but, um, [Audience Laughing]

00:58:10.208-->00:58:17.042
when you type slash Nick in IRC,
you put your handle in. Um, some
of the, some of the rules here,

00:58:17.042-->00:58:22.167
this is for fun. We’re gonna
invite people up here, you’re
gonna come here and you’re gonna

00:58:22.167-->00:58:26.708
talk about yourself, but we
wanna know things that are
interesting, things that other

00:58:26.708-->00:58:32.333
people may not necessarily know,
maybe even embracing things. >>
Especially embarrassing

00:58:32.333-->00:58:37.333
>>Especially embarrassing. So
Roamer and I used to work with a
guy, um, whose handle is Wod. He

00:58:39.458-->00:58:44.458
originally got his handle
because he typed in password,
PASSWORD wrong, twice. He typed

00:58:51.083-->00:58:58.083
in password, left the R off
twice, so we called him passwod
for a while. Then, ah, we were

00:58:58.083-->00:59:03.083
on ah, a trip together doing an
assessment and ah we went to a
club, club. And that club

00:59:06.417-->00:59:11.417
happened to have a lot of black
lights in it and Danny walked in
[Laughter] and his shirt lit up

00:59:15.000-->00:59:19.458
[Laughter] and Roamer said,
‘Dude, why did you wear your Wod
shirt here?’ [Laughter] I

00:59:19.458-->00:59:24.458
believe there are jokes about
masturbation, and a couple of
others, but Wod stuck and he

00:59:26.583-->00:59:32.292
hates it [Laughter] but it’s
still his nickname. It’s still
his handle, we call him Wod and

00:59:32.292-->00:59:36.958
I’m sorry that he’s not here.
>>We called him Deej before, he
hated that >>Oh yeah, there are

00:59:36.958-->00:59:42.167
so many >>He’s in the room >>He
is in the room? >>That’s great
[Laughter] that’s great, I love

00:59:42.167-->00:59:47.167
that story. Alright, so, um, we
will pick on you, much like we
picked on Wod. Um, but your

00:59:50.167-->00:59:54.542
handle will be a badge of
honour. We’re gonna invite you
to come up here to the podium to

00:59:54.542-->01:00:01.375
talk, because you should talk to
all of these people. Once you’ve
got your handle, when you’re in

01:00:01.375-->01:00:07.875
the hallway and you’re [Pause]
Dr Kitty. I’m trying to remember
some of the others.. >>Mom jeans

01:00:07.875-->01:00:12.875
>>Spud, Mom jeans, Mittens, you
know if you’re one of these
things. People are gonna say,

01:00:14.875-->01:00:19.875
‘Mittens Dude’, and hope fully
they will fist bump. Um, so I’d
like for ah, a few people to

01:00:24.292-->01:00:31.125
line up over here at the steps,
if you wanna get a handle. This
is part of the double dog and

01:00:31.125-->01:00:38.000
triple dog dare. Do something
you’re not comfortable with, get
up here and talk. [Pause] >>

01:00:38.000-->01:00:43.000
Double points if they’re a cute
guy. [Laughter] >>Alright, I
can’t say that >>Hold on, hold

01:00:45.583-->01:00:50.583
on [Laughter] >>I can’t say that
[Pause] >>Where’s Rob? >>I don’t

01:03:32.375-->01:03:37.083

01:03:44.375-->01:03:49.375
Okay, after much deliberation,

01:03:55.417-->01:04:00.417
[Audience laughs and claps] We
have Noob challenge coins, see
us at the ah, ah Noob party and

01:04:03.583-->01:04:09.458

>>I’ll give you a head up, I’ll

01:04:27.083-->01:04:31.917
fist bump anybody that wants to,
but the Con crud that Wiseacre
was talking about, I am

01:04:31.917-->01:04:36.708
absolutely patient zero. So I
would [Laughter] I’m doing my
best not to cough directly into

01:04:36.708-->01:04:41.667
the microphone but if you, if I
do that I apologize. >>Shut up,
this one’s gonna keep on

01:04:41.667-->01:04:47.375
>>Alright, our next victim
[Laughter] five things about
yourself that most people don’t

01:04:47.375-->01:04:52.333
know. Introduce your name first
and then things people don’t
know. >>First off, how’re you

01:04:52.333-->01:04:59.042
doin? [Pause] >>Awesome
[Laughter] >>Um, cool, so ah, my
name is Art, and what most

01:04:59.042-->01:05:05.792
people don’t know is, is my name
isn’t actually Art. Ah, maybe
third year into high school one

01:05:05.792-->01:05:10.167
of the teachers couldn’t
pronounce my name and they said
Art instead and I thought that’s

01:05:10.167-->01:05:15.583
great. I’m in the art, ah like
high school class, this gonna,
this is gonna be the best thing

01:05:15.583-->01:05:19.875
ever, so I just stuck with Art.
And from that point onward,
everyone just calls me Art.

01:05:19.875-->01:05:24.875
>>Where’re you from? >>Ah I’m,
I’m a Russian guy, I live in
Ireland [Laughter] Um, but most

01:05:28.625-->01:05:33.625
people know that. Um [Pause] Ah,
most people don’t know why I got
into tech or why I’m even here,

01:05:35.750-->01:05:40.792
um, I’m about seven years ago I
watched some Def Con videos, I
thought I loved the atmosphere.

01:05:40.792-->01:05:46.917
Um, so, ah, it was kinda, on
the, um on the backburner for
awhile, but for the last two

01:05:46.917-->01:05:51.917
years I kinda got to learn and,
ah, program full time. Ah, read,
ah, one time Googled, ‘How to

01:05:54.250-->01:05:58.542
become a hacker’ and found Eric
Kramer’s blog, ah telling me
that you’re on a Linux user

01:05:58.542-->01:06:03.542
group. Ah, the next month, I
joined hacker space, um,
travelled there at midnight and

01:06:05.708-->01:06:11.333
stayed there for 24 hours before
going to work. [Laughs]
>>Alright, I’m going to moderate

01:06:11.333-->01:06:14.667
>>One more question, what’s the
one thing you wanna do at Def
Con? Or what do you wand do

01:06:14.667-->01:06:19.667

01:09:02.833-->01:09:08.125

end developer, some unique
things about me. I’m originally

01:09:08.125-->01:09:14.375
from a town of less than 500
people from the Mid-West before
I moved to New York City

01:09:14.375-->01:09:18.833
[Audience hoots] Thank you. I
lost all my hair after moving to
New York City. [Laughter] I am

01:09:18.833-->01:09:23.833
ah, well I was a designer before
I’m a developer and I’m a
self-taught developer, which

01:09:26.583-->01:09:31.583
means I’m probably bad at
development. Ah, I’m really into
Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, but to

01:09:34.500-->01:09:39.500
counter that [Audience hoots] to
counter that I also did a year
of ballet when I was about

[Pause] >> My, I will say my

would be easy for him to pick up

01:13:15.792-->01:13:21.875

great. Um, and then I got
expelled from my school, cause

01:24:50.250-->01:24:55.250
so one of the things that I
learned in my youth back when I
did drink a lot when, which I

01:24:57.417-->01:25:03.208
don’t know at all anymore. The
best place to throw up is in the
snow because it freezes

01:25:03.208-->01:25:08.208
instantly and you have an ice
pack right there. [Pause] So, so
just a pro tip, you know if you

01:25:11.083-->01:25:16.083
ever want to splinter off Def
Con do it like, you know in the
mountains, like Colorado. >>

01:25:28.292-->01:25:34.917

01:25:34.917-->01:25:40.625
getting the social cues [Pause]
then we went just to, ‘Cathy’
cause that was goin to be fun

01:25:40.625-->01:25:45.625
and then we heard the story
about throwing up. ‘Fist
Catheter’ [Audience laughs and

01:25:48.917-->01:25:53.917
claps] >> Here I was thinking
Hairball, but I’ll take it

Chuck, I’m from West Virginia,
yes we do have internet out in

01:27:50.167-->01:27:54.208
West Virginia, its dial up but
we’re gettin’ better every day.
Ah, embarrassing story about

01:27:54.208-->01:27:59.208
myself, ten years ago when I was
doin’ a contracting job in Iraq,
I was on a Deadeye T- support or

01:28:01.708-->01:28:05.875
area reconstruction team, we’d
go out and meet with the tribal
leaders and eat a meal with them

01:28:05.875-->01:28:10.292
to show them we’re all still
friends even though we hate you,
you hate us. At one of these

01:28:10.292-->01:28:15.833
meals the tribal leader produces
the roast goat, pops the
eyeballs out and asks who’s

01:28:15.833-->01:28:22.000
gonna eat an eyeball with me? I
am that guy [Audience hoots] and
from then on I was his best

01:28:22.000-->01:28:26.000
friend because no one else would
ever do it. >> So you ate the
goat eye? >> Yes and he did too

01:28:26.000-->01:28:32.625
>> Have you done anything else
with a goat? [Audience laughs]
>> Only watch Gladiator movies

01:28:32.625-->01:28:39.042
[Pause] >> Tell us more stuff >>
Let’s see, I, I delivered our
last child, so Nikita if the

01:28:39.042-->01:28:43.875
paramedics can’t make it I do
have experience. I hope to never
do that again but [Laughter] >>

01:28:43.875-->01:28:48.875
Anything >> See, what else, um I

trades type, um. It’s about it

this hot weather. Hi, I’m Mark

01:29:25.000-->01:29:29.458
up until yesterday at Bayside,
besides um [Background comments]
I virtually new absolutely

01:29:29.458-->01:29:34.292
nothing about this community or
this world so I’m like the ultra
Nooby here >> Wait, wait, hold

01:29:34.292-->01:29:40.042
on. You got a f*cking boner in
your tights [Audience laughs and
claps] >> This is not a boner;

01:29:40.042-->01:29:45.167
this is regular this [Laughter]
>> It’s like; it’s like staring
at me [Laughter] it’s staring at

01:29:45.167-->01:29:50.667
me >> You, you can see for
yourself what that actually
looks like later [Laughter] Um,

01:29:50.667-->01:29:55.667
things that are rarely known
about me um, I had a short lived
career, um it was short lived

01:29:58.125-->01:30:02.708
because it was getting too much
for me at such a young age, but
I actually worked in sexual

01:30:02.708-->01:30:07.708
therapy. Ah, we [Audience
laughs] we, we, taught couples
and single women how to ah

01:30:10.500-->01:30:16.292
perform female ejaculation and
coached women on how to get
there psychologically. Um to

01:30:16.292-->01:30:21.292
allow themselves to be able to
do that, um I [Laughter] >> We
gotta stop now [Laughter] Wow

01:30:25.000-->01:30:31.583
[Laughter] >> It’s actually fun,
okay. >> Okay, I’m gonna post
this on twitter later, he’s got

01:30:31.583-->01:30:36.583
a f*ckin boner >> You wanted to
go there, we’ll take you there
>> It’s gonna be hard to follow

01:30:40.083-->01:30:45.083
up this guy, but this is, Boner
[Audience laughs, hoots and
claps] [Pause] >> Hi my name’s

01:31:01.083-->01:31:05.708
Mark that would be Mark for you
American’s cause you don’t
pronounce it the right way. Ah,

01:31:05.708-->01:31:11.458
I’m an Australian I’ve been
living in Seattle for 11 years.
So five things would be, um I’ve

01:31:11.458-->01:31:17.500
been made fun of [Stutters] I’ve
been made of on an Australian TV
show before and have a YouTube

01:31:17.500-->01:31:24.250
video to prove it. I, I’m the
middle child of five and because
of that I’ve had middle child

01:31:24.250-->01:31:29.250
syndrome so clearly I’m the most
successful out of all of them.
I, what are the five? Oh I’ve an

01:31:31.292-->01:31:35.333
uncanny knack to spot a spelling
mistake without actually reading
anything my eye just naturally

01:31:35.333-->01:31:40.333
gravitates to it. Um [Pause] >>
Oh yeah >> Oh totally >> I’m
guessing [Laughter] >> Alright,

01:32:01.167-->01:32:06.167
it’s painfully obvious [Pause]
this is, ‘Dingo’ [Audience
laughs and claps] >> In a former

01:32:08.667-->01:32:13.750
life I was a sound guy, so I’m
gonna eat the mike. Um, I live
in South-West Missouri which I

01:32:13.750-->01:32:18.917
call misery, um one reason I’m
in misery is because I’m
attracted to Asian guys. I’ve

01:32:18.917-->01:32:23.458
registered for QueerCon and I’m
surrounded by white country
guys, so I desperately want to

01:32:23.458-->01:32:28.458
move. Um, ah I love film scores,
soundtracks, John Williams is a
genius. Ah, I’ve been

01:32:30.500-->01:32:37.417
backpacking in New Zealand and
China, I love it can’t wait to
do more of it. I’m an insomniac,

01:32:37.417-->01:32:42.417
g*d I had so many ideas and I’m
blanking on em. Um, ah, ah >>
Tell us your wildest sexual

01:32:45.083-->01:32:50.083
experience; what’s the [Audience
laughs] [Pause] >> Yeah that
can’t be spoken about [Laughter]

01:32:56.792-->01:33:03.250
Um >>Where’s the weirdest place
you’ve ever had, ah, sexual
congress with someone?

01:33:03.250-->01:33:07.667
[Laughter] >> Theirs is no weird
place, once we’re outdoors,
pools like everything is like

01:33:07.667-->01:33:12.583
legit, no, there’s nothing that
nobody hasn’t done sexually, so.
>> How about on the stage? >> On

01:33:12.583-->01:33:17.750
the stage? [Laughter] I have
never had sex on stage in
public. >>Okay >> Good, we’re

01:33:17.750-->01:33:22.750
good >> Oaky >> We’re gonna slow
you down there before you do
[Laughter] >> Alright, step back

01:33:26.208-->01:33:31.500
[Laughter] crowding the mike >>
Oh, ah one last bit I was, I am
a former Mormon I was a

01:33:31.500-->01:33:38.250

the day. [Audience hoots] >>
Well, while LDS will work, we’re

01:33:38.250-->01:33:43.250

[Audience applauses] >>
SoundByte we actually enjoyed

01:33:45.458-->01:33:51.958
you so much, I have a special
badge for you. You shouldn’t
take offense because it has

01:33:51.958-->01:33:58.208
deodorant in it because you
don’t smell, but Wick, he’s
around here somewhere created

01:33:58.208-->01:34:03.708
these awesome badges with the
countdown; use deodorant four
times a day, three hours of

01:34:03.708-->01:34:08.708
sleep, two meals, one shower,
zero arrests. >> Thank you
[Audience applauses] [Pause] >>

01:34:24.583-->01:34:26.583
This will be fantastic, aah >> I

everybody call me Elle, Eli, hey

01:34:30.500-->01:34:35.500

can never remember my name so I
named myself Elle. So, um I’m

01:34:41.042-->01:34:46.042
from Venezuela, um usually the
only girl in the building. So I
have the bathroom all for

01:34:48.542-->01:34:53.542
myself. And um, kinda new to
this, so I’m way out of my
comfort zone because you say so,

01:34:56.708-->01:35:01.708
so I’m here. So, hit me
[Audience hoots and claps] >>
It’s ah, give us, what do you do

alcoholic drink? >> Um, well I
discovered something called, um,

01:35:17.875-->01:35:22.875

I got so drunk I don’t remember
>> Ferreted out that hidden gem,

01:35:26.542-->01:35:32.292

actually not bad this is

01:35:32.292-->01:35:37.458
actually, ah kinda fun, um my
mother in law loves mojitos but
for some reason she can’t say

01:35:37.458-->01:35:42.458
them right, so you’re gonna be,
‘Mojo’ [Audience laughs and
claps] and actually we have

01:35:44.792-->01:35:50.542
something special for you since
you’re out of your comfort zone.

Optics actually was awesome and
they gave us some, ah Gunnar’s
and I use mine pretty much on a

01:35:56.125-->01:36:01.000
daily basis which is a shameless
plug. They don’t give me any
money or anything like that, I

01:36:01.000-->01:36:06.000
truly believe in these things.
So, here you go. >> Awesome, yes

interested in programing when I
was around 11 and I got a virus

01:36:47.250-->01:36:53.792

downloaded something to try and
hack a Minecraft server. [Pause]

01:36:53.792-->01:36:58.792
[Laughter] >> Go on >> It didn’t
hack the server; I got a blue
screen of death but um [Pause] I

the things like JavaScript and
stuff like that. I’m not and

01:37:10.292-->01:37:15.542

website it will probably break
if somebody tries to break it.

01:37:15.542-->01:37:21.667
Um, alright give me something to
talk about. >> I don’t wanna
f*cking go to jail so I’m not

interests me cause there’s a lot

01:37:51.625-->01:37:58.292
you can do with it, um [Pause]
>> Does your parents know you’re

you may see me sitting at the
side of the hall begging for

01:38:55.167-->01:39:00.292
food, offering services. Um,
[Pause] [Laughing] not that type
of service. [Laughter] unless

01:39:00.292-->01:39:06.792
you pay a lot, um [Pause] I do
open exploration given I live in
Detroit, lots of burned out

01:39:06.792-->01:39:11.792
buildings and I know for a fact
I cannot outrun a cop car. Um,

Street Fighter? You guys like

01:39:37.292-->01:39:41.167
Street Fighter? [Audience hoots
and claps] Street Fighter’s
Gold. Alright, so ah, my name is

01:39:41.167-->01:39:44.083
to be determined, I haven’t said
that yet I probably don’t want
to say it, cause I’m gonna tell

01:39:44.083-->01:39:48.958
you guys a really funny and
embarrassing story. And I hold
this story very dear to myself

01:39:48.958-->01:39:53.792
but I’m up here so I might as
well tell it. Um, I,
historically I’ve had really

01:39:53.792-->01:39:58.958
awful first days at work, all
the time, every time, [Stutters]
whether I like fell at sleep at

01:39:58.958-->01:40:04.708
work or like passed gas at the
wrong time, like I have had it
pretty bad. But one day I got

01:40:04.708-->01:40:09.958
hired at a new company and um, I
was wearing these really pointy
boots, okay. They were like

01:40:09.958-->01:40:15.417
these light brown pointy shoes
and my stomach was hurting
really bad that day, like I had

01:40:15.417-->01:40:20.917
a lot of protein, I don’t know.
[Laughter] I was working out a
lot, nothing good okay and um, I

01:40:20.917-->01:40:24.667
went up to go to the bathroom.
On my way to the bathroom
there’s like a door, and there’s

01:40:24.667-->01:40:28.000
like a hallway, there’s a
women’s bathroom and a men’s
bathroom. And as I walked

01:40:28.000-->01:40:33.250
through the door, the coast is
clear behind me so I let it go,
I’m like okay. I started walking

01:40:33.250-->01:40:36.667
and someone opens up the door
behind me and starts walking to
the bathroom too. And there’s

01:40:36.667-->01:40:40.292
this woman and she’s over there
and like [imitating vomiting
sound] like [imitating vomiting

01:40:40.292-->01:40:45.125
sound] like it, it stinks, like
it’s awful. Oh my g*d, and I
freak out and I panic so I run

01:40:45.125-->01:40:49.250
into the bathroom and as I run
into the bathroom, I look around
and I’m like oh, interesting,

01:40:49.250-->01:40:54.250
these bathrooms don’t have
urinals, very nice [Laughter] I
go to the stall and as soon as I

01:40:56.792-->01:41:00.667
get in the stall I hear
someone’s heels walking into the
bathroom and I immediately, I

01:41:00.667-->01:41:05.083
pick up my pointy little boots
and I like sit up in the stall
and I’m like freaking out,

01:41:05.083-->01:41:11.125
panicking. I’m like, oh sh*t I
walked in the women’s bathroom.
>> We’re ready bro, we’re ready

01:41:11.125-->01:41:15.542
[Laughter] >> That’s the story
>> Cool story, bro >> Yeah
[Laughs], some of you may

01:41:15.542-->01:41:21.708
actually get the reference,
‘Kinky Boots’ [Audience hoots
and claps] >> And I’m gonna give

01:41:21.708-->01:41:26.708
you a pair of Gunnar’s too for
that crazy story >> Thanks man,
thanks man [Pause] >> No, you

01:41:30.292-->01:41:36.583
don’t get one of these; you get
glasses [Pause] >> Evening, ah
my name is Tyson, I am from

01:41:36.583-->01:41:41.583
Vermont, um and ah, my,
obviously first time at Def Con.
Ah [Laughter] so, um, let’s see

01:41:44.458-->01:41:50.750
ah story. About 8 months ago I
ended up underneath the back of
a van that ran me over while I

01:41:50.750-->01:41:55.292
was on my motorcycle, so I have
a Titanium leg. Um, so that’s
something new most people don’t

01:41:55.292-->01:42:00.292
know. Um, let’s see what else?
Is it, how quick do you want
this? >> Um, [Audience comments

01:42:03.833-->01:42:07.792
and laughs] >> How quick do you
want it? There you go, um, let’s
see, so >> How quick can you go?

01:42:07.792-->01:42:12.792
>> How quick can you go, ah,
yeah. [Pause] That’s all I got I
guess. >> You can stop >> Okay

01:42:15.042-->01:42:21.083
go for it >> Yeah, most of you
won’t get this reference, but
it’s a very Vermont thing.

01:42:21.083-->01:42:26.083
‘Jeezum Crow’ [Audience
applauses] >> I would like to
bring you two ladies up to the

01:42:39.042-->01:42:44.042
front, please [Pause] >>
Alright, White Hat [Pause] >>
Hi, my name is Shane, I’m from

01:42:50.083-->01:42:56.250
New Mexico. Um, I have a PhD and
I also have a kettle corn
business. Um, I’ve got a service

01:42:56.250-->01:43:01.417
dog named, Houdini, but he
doesn’t fly so he can’t be here.
He’s magical and an escape

01:43:01.417-->01:43:06.417
artist and this is my first Def
Con and for someone who used to
hate programming in high school,

01:43:09.208-->01:43:13.667
I ended up with a PhD in
computer science. [Pause] >>
Whatever make you more money

01:43:13.667-->01:43:19.500
[Audience claps] the PhD or the
kettle corn >> The PhD totally
kills it [Pause] >> You should

01:43:19.500-->01:43:24.375
make better kettle corn
[Audience laughs] >> We have
lines, its, it’s fun, but I only

01:43:24.375-->01:43:29.375
do it at like once a, I only do
it once a week [Pause] >>
[Laughter] I like to do it often

01:43:34.875-->01:43:39.875
>> It’s Kettle Corn >> Kettle
Corn? >> Ah, yeah >> Yeah,
Alright, we’re gonna call our

01:43:52.000-->01:43:57.000
newest friend, ‘Sweetie’ >> g*d,
Mike why do you have to be so
misogynistic? [Audience laughs

01:44:13.375-->01:44:18.375
and clasp] [Pause] >> I’m gonna
start throwing chips >> That’s
okay [Audience hoots, claps and

01:44:31.125-->01:44:34.125
laughs] >> [Inaudible comments]
>> I’m Christine, hi. I’m from
Florida and ah, not, not the

01:44:34.125-->01:44:37.500
East side but the part that’s
kinda like Alabama so
technically lower Alabama or

01:44:37.500-->01:44:42.250
L.A. [Audience Hoots] Ah, the
furry thing at my feet is,
Manny, he’s a pure bred Belgian

01:44:42.250-->01:44:47.292
Shepard, he’s my service dog.
Um, up until a couple of years
ago, I had a really weird

01:44:47.292-->01:44:52.583
infatuation with, antebellum
dresses or southern belle
dresses and I actually dressed

01:44:52.583-->01:44:58.750
in em. AH, for many years, um,
kinda ‘Gone with the wind’
style, lots of corsets, it was

01:44:58.750-->01:45:03.750
really uncomfortable. Um, I ah
[Pause] let’s see [Pause] I had
a whole bunch of stuff until I

01:45:07.458-->01:45:13.667
walked up here. I have a really
bad memory, um, I’m bionic
actually, I have a pulse wave

01:45:13.667-->01:45:20.333
generator in my back, so I can’t

01:46:07.917-->01:46:14.417
Rebecca, I’m out of DC, um and,
I’m really, really, really,
really, really new. Um, my

01:46:14.417-->01:46:21.042
approach to this was just like,
don’t bring anything, they’ll
hack it all. So like, you guys

01:46:21.042-->01:46:27.667
are kinda like wizards to me,
but um, so >> [Inaudible
comment] >> Huh? >> He is a

01:46:27.667-->01:46:33.917
wizard >> Um so I’m, I’m into SE
but I, I don’t know terribly
much about anything yet. Ah, you

01:46:33.917-->01:46:39.500
guys wanted embarrassing
stories? >> Yeah >> Um, I’m no
longer allowed to own vacuum

01:46:39.500-->01:46:46.375
cleaners because within one year
I broke my pinkie toe and tore
off my big toe nail trying to

01:46:46.375-->01:46:51.375
vacuum. Ah [Laughter] I’m also
no longer allowed to make
casseroles because I have two

01:46:54.083-->01:46:58.708
consecutive years’ worth of
Christmas party burns, ah my
wrist, from the, the same

01:46:58.708-->01:47:03.708
casserole pan, um, not very
domestic. Um [Laughter] Ah,
let’s see the terrifying

01:47:09.250-->01:47:14.167
childhood story my dad always
brings up, is the time that my
cat bit me and then they

01:47:14.167-->01:47:18.583
couldn’t find me and my cat
started tearing across the house
and I came out and bit him back

01:47:18.583-->01:47:23.583
and I had fur on my mouth.
[Audience laughs and claps] I’m,
I’m happy to deliver on the

01:47:27.958-->01:47:33.917
embarrassment. [Laughter] but
um, I can’t think of anything
else to say. I was sitting there

01:47:33.917-->01:47:37.083
in line and I’m like what do you
tell a room full of people that
don’t know you to try and get

01:47:37.083-->01:47:42.917
them to know you well enough to
name you and I’m just like >>
No, no [Pause] >>Ah, yes, so

01:47:42.917-->01:47:47.708

was the obvious choice
[Laughter] >> Alright >> We are

01:47:47.708-->01:47:52.708
ready >> We are ready >> Hey >>
Don’t be nervous >> I’m always
nervous >> I would be [Laughter]

01:47:56.958-->01:48:03.875
>> So it started out when you
told the story about how
awesomely nimble you are. We

01:48:03.875-->01:48:10.500
were going to call you Grace,
and then we heard about biting
your cat. [Audience laughs] And

01:48:10.500-->01:48:15.500
then we thought about Hannibal
[Laughter] but we’re gonna
settle on, ‘Clarice’ [Audience

01:48:21.458-->01:48:26.458
laughs and claps] >> Last one?
Last one >> Yeah, last one
[Pause] >> You’re our last one
