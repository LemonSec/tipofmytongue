00:00:00.267-->00:00:05.506
>>So everybody thank you for uh
coming. Uh it's a big honor for
us uh, this is a- a big event

00:00:05.506-->00:00:07.507
for me personally it's a sort of
a career highlight as far as
public speaking goes. Um this is

00:00:07.507-->00:00:12.513
Eden, I'm Inbar. We're gonna
talk about uh uhh what we call
"From uh One Country One Floppy

00:00:16.516-->00:00:21.521
to Startup Nation, a
retrospective on the 25 Israeli
uhh hacking years". From the

00:00:24.358-->00:00:29.363
early days of the community
until uh where we are today. And
um a disclaimer first because uh

00:00:32.099-->00:00:35.736
we're gonna be talking about
hacking and this is all, you
know, recorded and everything,

00:00:35.736-->00:00:40.741
whenever I say "I", or whenever
one of us says "I" it means one
of us. And whenever one of us

00:00:44.044-->00:00:49.049
says we that means uh the
community, ok? Unless otherwise
stated. Ok. [audience chuckles]

00:00:52.252-->00:00:58.091
So if I say we did that then
it's not us it's cause you're
we're speaking for a big

00:00:58.091-->00:01:03.030
community here. Uh a little bit
about uhh, us, why we are here.
Um as you can see I was born in

00:01:06.566-->00:01:11.571
1975. I got my first computer it
was a Dragon 64. It was in 1984.
Uh my first PC was an Amstrad PC

00:01:14.875-->00:01:19.880
1512 (That was uh...'88. Joined
the military in '93 like most
people in Israel; left the

00:01:23.250-->00:01:28.789
military 18 years later. Went to
work for Checkpoints and then
for Perimeter X. I'll let

00:01:28.789-->00:01:34.027
Eden... >>So we we shared the
Amstrad in fact we actually got
to know each other when we were

00:01:34.027-->00:01:39.599
13 and there's a story about
that as well. But before moving
over to the dark side of being a

00:01:39.599-->00:01:44.604
venture capitalist I built
Aternity who I sold to RiverBed
and then Face dot com that if

00:01:44.604-->00:01:49.609
you use Facebook, initially on
Facebook, that's us. >>And uh
why are we here? Every time we

00:01:52.813-->00:01:57.818
meet we tell war stories. And uh
since we're old, relatively old,
then we keep covering all all

00:02:01.121-->00:02:05.959
the time for you, since the late
eighties early nineties. And we
like telling the war stories and

00:02:05.959-->00:02:12.165
all of a sudden Defcon 25 had a
theme that said 25 years of
hacking and I'm like, okay.

00:02:12.165-->00:02:18.438
Let's put it in writing and
let's share it with others. Uh
but our story actually starts a

00:02:18.438-->00:02:24.444
long long time ago. Uh we're not
exactly sure. I mean I I started
reverse engineering at 14 so

00:02:24.444-->00:02:29.449
that puts it around 1989. Uh but
this is all very vague because
we're looking back a long time

00:02:31.752-->00:02:38.625
ago. Umm >>Some of the people in
the story that you'll see during
the conversation are pretty

00:02:38.625-->00:02:44.765
interesting. Alright the first
one, this guy ran the biggest
wares site in Israel, 1 man

00:02:44.765-->00:02:49.770
crew. This guy I knew only on
QSD X25 as D'yer Mak'er This guy
had BBS along with this guy. And

00:02:54.408-->00:02:59.413
then this some people know but
he was just hacking around on
the coders' channel on IRC. This

00:03:03.483-->00:03:08.488
ran the Lamer Slasher BBS doing
some lyrics and copyright
infringement at mass. He was

00:03:11.124-->00:03:17.798
before being arrested, three
times, he was only arrested once
[chuckles in crowd] and that's

00:03:17.798-->00:03:23.437
the two of us... >>Yeah >>
...there, basically around those
ages. >>You can notice I still

00:03:23.437-->00:03:28.442
have two hands there. [crowd
laughs] So that's old. >>That's
old. >>Uh so why one country one

00:03:30.710-->00:03:37.050
floppy? The percentage back at
the time was was amazing. It is
estimated at 98 percent of the

00:03:37.050-->00:03:43.657
software in Israel back at the
late eighties and early nineties
was pirated. And the reason is

00:03:43.657-->00:03:48.662
basically that: why not? It's...
you can and most of it wasn't
really protected and uh we liked

00:03:51.431-->00:03:56.503
the challenge when it was
protected and it was sort of a
revolt because software was

00:03:56.503-->00:04:01.741
really expensive back then. I
mean today we we've moved to a
situation where what software

00:04:01.741-->00:04:07.514
that used to cost seven hundred
dollars on your PC now costs 5
or 6 on your phone. But back

00:04:07.514-->00:04:11.952
then it was a lot of money and
if you wanted to have a lot of
stuff, that was very expensive.

00:04:11.952-->00:04:16.656
We couldn't afford it. Ss- so
th- the Middle Eastern mentality
and then then a bunch of other

00:04:16.656-->00:04:21.995
things kind of made it clear to
us that no, we're not gonna pay
for that. We can just, you know,

00:04:21.995-->00:04:27.501
have it. [crowd laughs] >>And
talking about mentality, we'll
we'll end the presentation also

00:04:27.501-->00:04:33.206
with this, the- at at some 60
slides from now. So the Isreal
culture, you need to uh just to

00:04:33.206-->00:04:36.943
you give you the background. The
Isreal culture is disrespect for
authority. That's the biggest

00:04:36.943-->00:04:43.116
single most thing. Uh when my
son tells me "No that's not
smart. Go fill the tub and I'll

00:04:43.116-->00:04:49.022
stu- I'll then stop playing the
iPad." I'm actually proud,
alright? So and willingness to

00:04:49.022-->00:04:53.894
fail is a huge thing. Alright
and just constantly and that's
what you see most entrepreneurs

00:04:53.894-->00:04:59.132
do. Live today as there might be
no tomorrow, that's another
aspect of kinda the the Isreal

00:04:59.132-->00:05:04.538
culture. And if if you look at
the US you have a one percent of
the population that can write

00:05:04.538-->00:05:09.809
the book >>[offmic]Can you talk
into the microphone? >>Yes, I
will talk into the microph-. So

00:05:09.809-->00:05:13.180
yeah one percent of the
population in the US that can
write the book and then

00:05:13.180-->00:05:17.551
ninety-nine percent that
actually follow what is written
there. In Israel forty percent

00:05:17.551-->00:05:23.990
can write the book and then
sixty percent don't listen.
[crowd laughs] So period of time

00:05:23.990-->00:05:30.597
that we're talking about this is
the late '80s early '90s um a
great period. And it's a great

00:05:30.597-->00:05:35.769
period because of a few things.
The first is this is the Israeli
computer law that was passed

00:05:35.769-->00:05:42.008
1995 so at that time there's no
law whatsoever you can do
anything you want. And the

00:05:42.008-->00:05:47.013
second is um during that time
the phone system did not have
any filters, right? Uh so we

00:05:49.115-->00:05:55.956
could basically do whatever that
we wanted and it was a very very
very slow internet. >>So the

00:05:55.956-->00:06:01.761
this is the logo of the national
phone company. Funny as it may
sound it was actually officially

00:06:01.761-->00:06:07.834
formed in 1982 as a government
owned company. And because of
being a government owned company

00:06:07.834-->00:06:11.271
there was a lot of conflict
going there, not everybody
agreed on what they should do,

00:06:11.271-->00:06:16.276
it actually only started
operating in 1984. Um the
country was formed in 1948 so

00:06:18.278-->00:06:23.283
you can, you know. The the the
concept of mess is gonna be
around this conversation the-

00:06:23.283-->00:06:29.990
th- this talk so that's one of
the things we're gonna show you.
Uh on the right you can see the

00:06:29.990-->00:06:34.995
um token operated uh pay phones.
Uh these were later uh switched
for uh uh plastic cards but uh

00:06:37.964-->00:06:43.303
we started with the tokens. On
the left you can see the rotary
dial uh everybody had those and

00:06:43.303-->00:06:48.174
it took a long time before we
switched over to tone dial which
is the one you see in the

00:06:48.174-->00:06:55.148
middle. A very long time and
this is gonna come up in this uh
talk as well. Umm many of the

00:06:55.148-->00:07:01.554
things you will see in this uh
uh talk are actually from our
private collections. We I

00:07:01.554-->00:07:06.359
wouldn't say we hoard but we
collect stuff from those days
and this is a scan that I

00:07:06.359-->00:07:12.632
actually made uh 5 days ago. I
actually have the floppies, they
were actually working. Uh I just

00:07:12.632-->00:07:17.904
moved uh 4 months ago and I
hired a company that also did
the packing and they put the

00:07:17.904-->00:07:22.909
floppies together with the
speakers so I guess
[disappointed sounds from crowd]

00:07:22.909-->00:07:28.648
yes yes uh thank you for your
support. Umm [crowd laughs] So
this is about as much as I can

00:07:28.648-->00:07:32.886
get. This is the floppy that we
were using to communicate with
some of the services uh of the

00:07:32.886-->00:07:37.891
phone company. Now before we
continue I want to talk a little
bit about terminology because

00:07:37.891-->00:07:42.896
back then uh it was not exactly
as it is today. Uh we had uh 4
common terms when when we

00:07:45.198-->00:07:50.437
considered uh the hacking
community. We had the hacking,
cracking, phreaking, and

00:07:50.437-->00:07:55.442
carding. Now hacking uh was the
act of no >>Going into somebody
else's system. >>That's it. I

00:07:57.911-->00:08:04.217
suppose everybody recognizes
that. Cracking was the act of
removing protections almost

00:08:04.217-->00:08:10.924
always copy protections. Uh we
copied games, games came with
codes or sheets of numbers that

00:08:10.924-->00:08:16.162
you needed. Uh we didn't like
that. There were some tougher
copy protections like lazer

00:08:16.162-->00:08:20.800
holds and uh in the floppy so
anything dealing with removing
the protection that was

00:08:20.800-->00:08:27.407
cracking. Phreaking was any
hacking on the phone system but
most commonly to uh make phone

00:08:27.407-->00:08:32.412
calls without paying. And
carding was using credit cards
that were not yours. Uh so

00:08:34.447-->00:08:38.918
here's an example we start with
phreaking. As I mentioned before
it took a while before the phone

00:08:38.918-->00:08:43.590
company switched over to tone
dial, uh when that happened most
of the payphones were still

00:08:43.590-->00:08:47.927
token operated. So if you
brought one of those little
devices, this is actually a

00:08:47.927-->00:08:52.832
remote control from old days uh
answering machines with
cassettes. So you could, th-

00:08:52.832-->00:08:56.636
it's a remote control you could
call home, get the machine to
answer you then you punch in a

00:08:56.636-->00:09:02.242
code you can check for messages.
But this is normal DTMF. So if
you just pick up the receiver of

00:09:02.242-->00:09:07.781
the payphone and use DTMF to
dial, then you can make a phone
call without paying. Alright.

00:09:07.781-->00:09:14.020
Umm call waiting. So that's very
annoying when you have a modem
because uh it actually drops the

00:09:14.020-->00:09:20.326
carrier tone. Uhh we had a lot
of problem with that and one of
the creative solution we had uh

00:09:20.326-->00:09:25.465
early in the day we had uh call
forwarding as well. Well it
turns out that uh the phone

00:09:25.465-->00:09:29.002
company didn't do any
contingencies and it turns out
that you could do call

00:09:29.002-->00:09:35.208
forwarding to your own number.
So uh what happened was that in
the beginning it crashed the

00:09:35.208-->00:09:40.113
phone company. Uh we have a
friend that told us the story.
Uh his trunk crashed, the phone

00:09:40.113-->00:09:44.951
company actually reached out to
him and they fixed it, but the
trick still worked later.

00:09:44.951-->00:09:51.691
[indistinguishable] >>So alri-
eh so we were using phones and
in in the phones the first thing

00:09:51.691-->00:09:58.231
that you do is you actually af-
after hacking it through but you
you wanna do you wanna use the

00:09:58.231-->00:10:04.971
BBS seed. And B you need to
realize that BBS just in changes
the phone cost was immense it

00:10:04.971-->00:10:10.977
was 3 dollars a minute to call
the US from Israel. So
everything was was local. It was

00:10:10.977-->00:10:16.316
a local ecosystem even though it
was a very very small system.
Actually Bezek, that same phone

00:10:16.316-->00:10:21.321
company, told us and disapproved
the importing of 96 hundred
bought modems because they said

00:10:23.456-->00:10:29.395
they would burn the the phone
lines. [audience laughs]
Seriously. So we had to smuggle

00:10:29.395-->00:10:34.400
96 hundred bought modems from
the US in carry ons. The, much
like every war it's a small

00:10:36.636-->00:10:41.641
community so it's like we have
less than a hundred people with
BBSs but there are already 2

00:10:41.641-->00:10:47.680
groups there, the XMLF and the
ICCA that fight each other. And
this is a hacking cracking

00:10:47.680-->00:10:52.819
community so how do they fight
is they write software in order
to crash the other network's

00:10:52.819-->00:10:57.824
hard drives. So the- each of
those networks is hiring coders
in order to create virii so they

00:11:00.994-->00:11:03.930
would crash the other ones
because they're starting to take
money and they don't want to

00:11:03.930-->00:11:08.935
have competition. On the free
side, those same people are now
re-writing uh Z modem, B modem,

00:11:11.404-->00:11:17.911
if people here still know them.
Just not to report the last CRC.
Because they didn't want the

00:11:17.911-->00:11:21.848
files to be counted. So you
would download the whole the
whole file but not report the

00:11:21.848-->00:11:27.287
whole- the last byte. The last
CRC of the byte and then that
wouldn't be counted. So you have

00:11:27.287-->00:11:32.926
a bunch of people trying to hack
through and that creates the
first first uh instances of the

00:11:32.926-->00:11:38.698
copyright, uh people or the
wares software right. So
LyricsInn is by Yaniv Taigmin

00:11:38.698-->00:11:43.703
the CTO of face dot com, the one
that sold to Facebook. And he
puts in the repository the the

00:11:45.872-->00:11:52.045
world's biggest repository of
lyrics but Israel doesn't have
not the computer law and very

00:11:52.045-->00:11:57.617
lack very uh relaxed uh also
copyright laws. So that becomes
the biggest repository that then

00:11:57.617-->00:12:02.288
moves over to the internet. But
we still do in-fighting so
Ultinet and C-Net are the 2

00:12:02.288-->00:12:07.293
first networks in Israel and
each hate each other for both
free but have different value

00:12:09.963-->00:12:14.400
systems. So they also want the
other ones to crash. And so
these were the infightings.

00:12:14.400-->00:12:19.405
>>Umm another front of the
fighting was the ANSI umm
screens these as you can see

00:12:22.942-->00:12:26.980
this is one of the uh things
that I found in my repository of
all the old stuff that I

00:12:26.980-->00:12:33.252
collected. Umm I don't have an
old machine any more, this was
actually uhh, I ran a VM of XP I

00:12:33.252-->00:12:39.626
think it was and uh VDraw, who
remembers VDraw? Alright we have
some people in the crowd here.

00:12:39.626-->00:12:46.265
So that was a program used to
create ANSI screens and you
could do animation and the BBSs

00:12:46.265-->00:12:52.739
competed for who has uh the the
nicer animation or who was
making fun of of the other ones

00:12:52.739-->00:12:59.078
as well. And as Eden mentioned
before the rivalry made it far.
This actually says... >>There's

00:12:59.078-->00:13:03.950
a good amount of Hebrew speakers
here I see >>Yes it says you're
an SOB. This is recorded so I'll

00:13:03.950-->00:13:08.955
be gentle umm. Uh when you were
trying to con your way into uh
improving your download ratio or

00:13:11.791-->00:13:15.895
uh maybe you know... >>rewriting
B modem I think. >>rewriting B
modem Z modem, or maybe you're

00:13:15.895-->00:13:21.034
username was suddenly associated
with the other group. Then you
received a warm welcome. >>And

00:13:21.034-->00:13:26.039
so you have you have many people
that are tryna, there's a a lot
of mess going on and many groups

00:13:29.742-->00:13:36.549
and so the only option at that
point, I'm 13 Inbar is 14 at the
time and then we meet my place.

00:13:36.549-->00:13:41.421
We say there are too many people
and there's too much fighting
going on, what do we need to do?

00:13:41.421-->00:13:45.925
We need to move from the techies
world to the organized world,
right, "organized." So the only

00:13:45.925-->00:13:51.431
sensible thing being 13 is we
need to take over the network.
[audience laughter] So how'd you

00:13:51.431-->00:13:56.369
do that when you are 13? Uh you
start a council you convince
people that you need a council

00:13:56.369-->00:14:01.841
because there is all this
infighting going on and but but
obviously someone needs to guard

00:14:01.841-->00:14:05.978
the council, right? So you need
an ethics committee. Meet the
ethics committee [laughs]

00:14:08.448-->00:14:13.186
[audience chuckles] And it's the
early intro how you run company
board of directors uh also some

00:14:13.186-->00:14:16.522
some of the prominent people at
that time actually the second
member of the ethics committee

00:14:16.522-->00:14:21.527
is a guy called Yoram Shamir um
in RSA eh Shamir the s- so the
prodigy of of uh Shamir is his

00:14:25.465-->00:14:29.802
Onfulma who is that early
participant in the ethics
committee. So many of those

00:14:29.802-->00:14:34.841
people started building also
more of a community around it.
>>So just to give you a small

00:14:34.841-->00:14:40.680
example of what the community
was uh like back then, despite
the fights, despite the the

00:14:40.680-->00:14:45.718
rivalries we were a community.
Uh mostly because we were all
geeks and we were outcasts to a

00:14:45.718-->00:14:49.856
certain extent some more than
others but there was a
community. There was this

00:14:49.856-->00:14:54.594
feeling that we are all part of
a bigger thing. And every now
and then we would have uh C soft

00:14:54.594-->00:14:59.799
meetings. All the BBS owners
would meet the house of one of
the participants everybody would

00:14:59.799-->00:15:06.005
go there we would talk talk talk
Eden and I we would you know run
things ethics committee whatever

00:15:06.005-->00:15:11.244
and on one of those uh meetings
that was in the north of Israel
I used to live south of Tel Aviv

00:15:11.244-->00:15:17.784
and on the way back we were on
the train and it was a rainy day
it was winter. And the roof was

00:15:17.784-->00:15:22.955
leaking so we were like 3 people
we had to uh switch cars went to
another car of course it was

00:15:22.955-->00:15:29.729
crowded so we end up sitting at
a table uh with a beautiful girl
and her mother. Now back then I

00:15:29.729-->00:15:35.234
wasn't yet able to uh hit on
girls in front of their mothers,
that is no longer the case but

00:15:35.234-->00:15:40.239
uh back then it was a problem. I
was 17 or 18 umm so all I could
do was try to get as much

00:15:42.608-->00:15:47.880
information as I could. Umm the
the trip ended with me knowing 4
things about that girl. I knew

00:15:47.880-->00:15:53.419
her first name, I knew what
grade she was on,I know what
city she lived in, and I knew

00:15:53.419-->00:15:59.559
the name of her mother. Now this
is Friday afternoon. I get home
and I frantically write a

00:15:59.559-->00:16:05.431
message on the EchoMail to all
my friends in the north this is
what I know, help me find that

00:16:05.431-->00:16:10.436
girl. [crowd laughs] Within less
than 24 hours, I had her phone
number. [crowd laughs and

00:16:13.172-->00:16:18.177
shouts] Swear to G*d .[applause]
Now uh sadly uh she had a
boyfriend. [crowd laughs] Which

00:16:21.647-->00:16:27.153
which does not decrease any of
the achievement and uh as a
little anecdote actually uh

00:16:27.153-->00:16:32.124
found her on facebook um a few
weeks ago and apparently she
remembers the story and they

00:16:32.124-->00:16:37.129
actually tell it in the family.
So uh it was kinda fun. >>So
[laughs] so rememb- so Fidonet

00:16:39.932-->00:16:45.204
EchoMail, right remember the
thing that actually calls in
every night in order to pull

00:16:45.204-->00:16:51.377
email from another note so this
is this is not the internet this
is not even leased lines. There

00:16:51.377-->00:16:55.114
were calls made multiple times
through the night in order to
push email towards a certain

00:16:55.114-->00:17:00.052
direction. But we wanted to go
global. Right? We we didn't feel
that it made sense for that

00:17:02.321-->00:17:08.027
small 200 people community in
Israel to to stay dormant there.
So if we're stuck in our little

00:17:08.027-->00:17:13.966
pond how do we go global?
Alright and just to frame the
reference is this is the history

00:17:13.966-->00:17:19.839
of of the evolvement of the
speed of the internet in the US.
Uhh and pretty staggering and in

00:17:19.839-->00:17:24.844
'90 eh '94 you have you only
have uh 50kilo BPS uh 90- 80-
80- '84 '86 is pretty still a

00:17:29.882-->00:17:34.887
bit of the same speed, another
link, '91 already it uh I think
it's 65 and then 165 iiiiin '94.

00:17:37.857-->00:17:42.862
So. To frame that. This is
israel, alright. '89, Bezek that
phone company informs Machba

00:17:46.265-->00:17:51.704
that's the backbone of the
internet in Israel that they are
not able to provide 56 kilo BPS.

00:17:51.704-->00:17:56.709
Uh to the US. For at least next
10 months. And so um they do the
backup and they do a 9.6kilo BPS

00:17:59.278-->00:18:04.216
to the US. Wonderful. '91 Bezek
gets an order for 64k to Europe.
7 months later there is that

00:18:10.890-->00:18:15.895
first line to Europe. Then just
'92, '92 the first high speed is
happening in Israel. Up until

00:18:18.030-->00:18:23.436
that point the only way to get
onto the internet was hack into
the universities or be a

00:18:23.436-->00:18:28.874
student, uh and the second is be
part of a multinational. So '92
first high speed is '95 the

00:18:28.874-->00:18:33.879
first bankrolled IPs. Uh '93 the
line to the US has been upgraded
to 128. Wonderful. So we need to

00:18:39.418-->00:18:44.423
take uh care of ourselves. >>So
one of the uh, the things that
we wanted to do was uh you know

00:18:46.592-->00:18:51.831
meet other people and CompuServe
was one of the leading platforms
back then. I don't know how many

00:18:51.831-->00:18:58.104
of you remember that. And
CompuServe was a paid service so
uh it turned out that in order

00:18:58.104-->00:19:04.243
to access CompuServe you can
sign up for a temporary uh
account you need to uh give your

00:19:04.243-->00:19:08.014
credit card number and a billing
address. Then you get a
temporary account for uh, I

00:19:08.014-->00:19:13.486
think it was what, 30 days? >>30
days. >>30 days. And after 30
days you start uh you know being

00:19:13.486-->00:19:19.925
charged for that. It turns out
that when you enter the uh
credit card information it

00:19:19.925-->00:19:24.930
doesn't get billed immediately.
What they do is they just check
the uh uh Luhn Modi- Mod 10

00:19:26.932-->00:19:32.872
formula so if you're you take a
credit card number a valid
credit card number and you make

00:19:32.872-->00:19:38.711
some alterations you can still
generate a card number that
doesn't exist but validates the

00:19:38.711-->00:19:44.850
formula. So what we would do is
we would make up credit card
numbers and then get an account

00:19:44.850-->00:19:49.021
for 30 days. 30 days later when
they figured they couldn't
charge the account, they closed

00:19:49.021-->00:19:55.127
it. And then we repeated that
again. >>Yeah I I think at one
point we were the largest

00:19:55.127-->00:20:02.101
consumers of uh the uh
evaluation accounts of
CompuServe in the world. >>Oh

00:20:02.101-->00:20:07.039
and eventually CompuServe
deleted or canceled the reverse
billing. Cause when we were

00:20:07.039-->00:20:10.743
accessing CompuServe we weren't
paying, so they stopped that
from Israel. >>[laughs] Yeah

00:20:10.743-->00:20:17.516
what a surprise but, and you
laugh right this is 25 years
back but um a very good friend

00:20:17.516-->00:20:23.489
of mine, Sam Lessin umm had
started his company called his
Fin. just recently as as of last

00:20:23.489-->00:20:29.662
year and he for the alpha he
went to his friends and he said
"Hey would you want to test it

00:20:29.662-->00:20:34.233
out? But I want to see that you
have I want to see that you have
value and so I'm asking for

00:20:34.233-->00:20:40.506
credit cards from the get-go."
And I'm thinking oh I know Sam
uh he's an MVP type of a guy ok

00:20:40.506-->00:20:46.812
he probably didn't implement the
billing code just yet. Uh he did
do the CRC check, you reverse

00:20:46.812-->00:20:52.351
the last 4 digits of your first
two- er last two groups; works,
maybe I'll use this stage to

00:20:52.351-->00:20:56.789
apologize to Sam that I haven't
been paying for the past year.
Uh but it's a great service try

00:20:56.789-->00:21:03.429
it out. [laughs] [chuckles from
crowd] >>Another way to call uh
BBSs in other countries was

00:21:03.429-->00:21:09.268
using calling cards. Back then
uh you would get a card that was
loaded with minutes you would

00:21:09.268-->00:21:14.273
call uh a number of an operator,
a person would pick it up. Um
you would give them the number.

00:21:16.442-->00:21:20.312
Many years later was already all
touch tone but back then you
actually spoke to someone. You

00:21:20.312-->00:21:25.251
said "Hi this is card number 1 2
3 4 5" and they said "Yes uh
where should I connect you to?"

00:21:25.251-->00:21:29.588
and you you would give them a
number. It turns out that some
of the people that were

00:21:29.588-->00:21:34.793
operators and I just put AT&T
because that's the image I found
but I'm pretty sure this was

00:21:34.793-->00:21:39.798
correct for other uh carriers as
well. Uh they would make a note
of the calling card number and

00:21:42.101-->00:21:47.940
then later share it with their
friends. So people were making
phone calls, uhh on somebody

00:21:47.940-->00:21:52.945
else's expense. Now back than
optic was not a term yet, we
didn't know anything about that

00:21:55.447-->00:22:00.386
and we used uh those things to
call BBSs, friends, I mean, if
anyone had investigated that,

00:22:05.691-->00:22:12.464
that wouldn't b- be a challenge.
Because it's all traceable. But
back then there was no awareness

00:22:12.464-->00:22:18.470
on any of the involved
authorities. OK? So I guess you
can say we were taking advantage

00:22:18.470-->00:22:24.076
of the situation and we were
kinda lucky. >>And also it's a
story we didn't intend to share

00:22:24.076-->00:22:29.348
but I I totally forgot that. So
what you could do, you'd you'd
call this toll free number. Uh

00:22:29.348-->00:22:36.188
say AT&T, right. And you'd give
them a calling card number and
they'd say well well that's an

00:22:36.188-->00:22:41.860
invalid number and there was a
different prefix for the MCI
ones and the AT&T ones and you'd

00:22:41.860-->00:22:45.297
say "Oh oh oh you're right, can
you transfer me to MCI?" And
they said "Sure" and they would

00:22:45.297-->00:22:51.971
transfer you and then to MCI you
just say "Uh can you just bill
me?" And they'de be billing

00:22:51.971-->00:22:57.176
AT&T, [audience laughs] because
AT&T transferred the call. Uh
which that that worked for a

00:22:57.176-->00:23:02.114
full 2 months [audience
chuckles] Uh so uh and so you
you you can't remember these

00:23:05.618-->00:23:09.688
things after a while. Uh so no
filters meant meant the obvious
thing right. You you all know

00:23:09.688-->00:23:15.861
Captain Crunch. Umm so 3 dollars
per minute is just too expensive
so what did we do? Uh if if we

00:23:15.861-->00:23:21.100
do do blue boxing there are 2
things, it's cheap meaning zero
and then it's also untraceable

00:23:21.100-->00:23:27.239
because you you hop between
multiple switchboards. And so
what you see here this is the CI

00:23:27.239-->00:23:32.311
the CCITT doc. CCITT 5 still had
inband trunking, inband
signaling, so you basically

00:23:32.311-->00:23:38.617
would call up a trunk, you would
call up a number and you could
signal the trunk. Initially just

00:23:38.617-->00:23:43.622
at 26 hundred, then 24 26, so it
it went on to multiple
combinations but what what you

00:23:45.958-->00:23:50.996
did have is people that are
willing to um borrow books from
the different switchboards. So

00:23:50.996-->00:23:57.803
you'd you'd know the different
signalings that they were using.
So this is '92 see the doc far

00:23:57.803-->00:24:04.410
far far after the US did not
have blue boxing working. And in
'92 what you see there is a call

00:24:04.410-->00:24:11.050
out to Amos Keron. Amos Keron
was the runner he was the sisoft
of uh NetOne which was another

00:24:11.050-->00:24:16.855
big wares sight in Israel. So en
em Amos Keron is supposed it's
just a name in Hebrew. It's like

00:24:16.855-->00:24:23.462
Justin. Right so years later I
finally realized that I can't
find Amos Keron uh so that was

00:24:23.462-->00:24:28.467
an alias. But for a while it it
was not that clear. So '92 he
was leading the blue boxing in

00:24:31.303-->00:24:38.243
Israel. And basically mid and
south America uh were controlled
by the Israel phreakers so Cuba,

00:24:38.243-->00:24:43.849
full control uh for very long
time. There was no uhh for 2-3
years you would call the 177

00:24:43.849-->00:24:47.986
number which is the 800 number
that would get you to the
operator over there and you

00:24:47.986-->00:24:52.524
could signal at that point and
from that point on you were a
switchboard yourself and you

00:24:52.524-->00:24:57.529
could call basically anywhere.
>>So other than the actual
calling of uh BBSs there was a

00:25:01.066-->00:25:07.172
pre-internet network that was
called the eh X-25. It's a
packet switching data network

00:25:07.172-->00:25:13.679
around across the entire uh
world and every country had its
own uh prefix. Uh here you can

00:25:13.679-->00:25:20.152
see a list of the country
prefixes. Uh Israel was uh 4251.
Funny thing is there was very

00:25:20.152-->00:25:24.656
little in Israel that was using
that and in any case it was in
Israel we didn't use we didn't

00:25:24.656-->00:25:30.129
need X-25 to access it so we
didn't actually remember that
this was the code for Israel. We

00:25:30.129-->00:25:35.134
do remember uh other networks,
and the United States for
example, 310 3110 and that was

00:25:38.704-->00:25:44.243
the pretty much equivalent of,
of uh IP address. It was called
the NUA network user uh address

00:25:44.243-->00:25:50.983
and the most I think prominent
uh I guess you could call it
site because back then it wasn't

00:25:50.983-->00:25:57.022
called that, uh was uh QSD. QSD
was a chat server... >>Ah ah-
anyone here remembers QSD?

00:25:57.022-->00:26:01.960
Anyone was on QSD? >>Alright
>>Yeah >>Shout out for you guys.
So QSD was the chat server in

00:26:04.630-->00:26:09.635
France. Umm something like IRC a
little bit uh more sophisticated
at the time. And everybody would

00:26:12.671-->00:26:18.010
hang out there, uh talk to one
another, and that was the
trading arena. You would uh find

00:26:18.010-->00:26:23.982
people uhh you would create
stuff with them. You would get
codes uhh or whatever it is that

00:26:23.982-->00:26:28.987
you were uh trading. And this is
the NUA we remember that by
heart. Um wake me up at 2am I

00:26:31.924-->00:26:36.929
will recite that number. And uhh
yeah that most of what we did
revolved around QSD. And these

00:26:38.997-->00:26:45.304
are umm... >>What about NUIs?
That was really simple. >>Okay
NUIs so this is not in the

00:26:45.304-->00:26:49.875
presentation but we're gonna uh
talk about that. Thank you for
reminding me of them. NUI the

00:26:49.875-->00:26:55.314
network user identity is how you
logged onto the network. And
back then uh in Israel at least

00:26:55.314-->00:27:00.118
there was uh a number a dial up
number you would call it. I
think it was like 133 or 135

00:27:00.118-->00:27:05.824
something like that. And then
you had to log in. And there was
no login and password. You know

00:27:05.824-->00:27:11.296
what we guy was we call today 2
factor authentication, that's a
3 factor authentication. You

00:27:11.296-->00:27:15.667
have a name, and er a log on,
and then you have a password,
and then you have another thing.

00:27:15.667-->00:27:20.672
Back then, it was just a log on.
And we uh discovered that some
of them had a pattern. Uh so we

00:27:24.243-->00:27:30.983
wrote uh scripts over some of
the uh telecommunication
programs such as uh Telex or uh

00:27:30.983-->00:27:37.489
Procam- Procom Place if you
remember those. Uh Telecom. And
we enumerated on logins because

00:27:37.489-->00:27:42.494
we figured out what the prefix
was, which was NBezek and then a
code, the 6 digit code. And it

00:27:45.397-->00:27:49.902
turns out that these codes were
actually technician codes so no
one was being billed for that

00:27:49.902-->00:27:55.607
and no one ever found out about
it. Um so that's one part of the
story. And what you're seeing

00:27:55.607-->00:28:00.546
now is a list of uh alt-dials.
These were actually um modems
connected to the X25 network.

00:28:03.382-->00:28:09.588
They would have an NUA. And when
you connected to them you ended
up having a terminal of a modem,

00:28:09.588-->00:28:15.260
which enabled you to dial a
local number. So the list that
you see in- in the bottom those

00:28:15.260-->00:28:20.365
are local out dials. There was
one for every area code in the
United States, and probably

00:28:20.365-->00:28:25.237
other places as well but back
then the United States was where
everybody was looking uh up to.

00:28:25.237-->00:28:30.242
And you can see that for every
area code you had a couple or
sometimes even 4 outdials uh

00:28:33.378-->00:28:38.417
changing in connection speeds.
And we also had global out
dials. These were actually

00:28:38.417-->00:28:44.022
modems that had an international
phone line. Now 'til this very
day I have no idea who was

00:28:44.022-->00:28:49.528
paying for that, because local
local calls back in the US were
not being charged. So I can't

00:28:49.528-->00:28:53.699
understand why someone would put
a system and connect it to the
entire world but a global out

00:28:53.699-->00:28:58.236
dial was a modem that could call
anywhere in the world. Uh one of
the things that we could do with

00:28:58.236-->00:29:03.175
that, for example is uh call
Israel or harass neighbors or
you know, whatever. >>Uh Inbar

00:29:06.378-->00:29:11.149
is being too nice to Bezek. So
the first codes were
NBezek000001. That's code number

00:29:11.149-->00:29:16.154
1, code number 2 was 2. 3. So
these died fairly quickly, the
other ones less so. Um so so

00:29:20.759-->00:29:25.764
that was kind of X25. How does
the internet look like from the
eyes of the 13 14 15 year old

00:29:28.333-->00:29:32.371
kids at the time because you
remember we don't have any
internet. Right we don't we

00:29:32.371-->00:29:39.011
can't buy an ISP account so this
logo is the logo of the Technion
the Israeli Technion and it's

00:29:39.011-->00:29:44.816
located in the HiFi it's very
similar to uh to MIT it's a
fairly highly regarded. Um one

00:29:44.816-->00:29:51.790
of the less regarded things uh
there was security at the time,
so if you wanted to postpone a

00:29:51.790-->00:29:58.130
class you had or uh the filing
of homework uh you could just
crash T2. T2 was the students'

00:29:58.130-->00:30:03.135
uh system. But this T2 was
actually much worse if you think
about security so. At one point

00:30:05.337-->00:30:10.509
it was clear that uh s- bit
login was actually modified,
that it would accept the

00:30:10.509-->00:30:15.514
password f**k you for any user.
Including root. [laughter in
crowd] So just to preserve the

00:30:17.582-->00:30:23.588
rights on on that computer. Then
interestingly new users right
new students, how do you set

00:30:23.588-->00:30:28.593
passwords for new students?
Nobody knew how to do it and so
what they decided on is hash. So

00:30:30.629-->00:30:36.168
they hash on their ID numbers,
so your student number was S and
then an ID number, and then your

00:30:36.168-->00:30:42.874
default password was a hash on
it. They also did not want to
publish the results of tests in

00:30:42.874-->00:30:49.614
an identified manner so they had
very big filings of them with
the ID number of the student and

00:30:49.614-->00:30:54.619
the mark he got. So you'd go up
a bus it's a 2 it's a 1-2 hour
ride and you take photos, er

00:30:58.557-->00:31:05.097
pictures, of the student marks
you go back you hash it out and
you have the passwords for any

00:31:05.097-->00:31:10.102
student on the T2. [audience
laughs] Yes. Uh so I wish that
was the security to I I I could

00:31:14.172-->00:31:18.410
tell you this was uh uh really
bad security at the time. But
Mashbir yeah cause this is like

00:31:18.410-->00:31:23.415
the Sears of Israel. Alright so
Sears, fairly large chain
Mashbir, um on their primary

00:31:25.851-->00:31:32.591
computer on the primary computer
system they had root root.[crowd
laughter] And somebody found it

00:31:32.591-->00:31:38.130
out which is fine so they were
dialed and they found the dial
in for that computer and they

00:31:38.130-->00:31:43.335
got scared so they posted the
number for the Mashbir uh cause
see the central computer they

00:31:43.335-->00:31:50.041
posted as a BBS on a BBS list.
And the reason was to have other
people discover that root root

00:31:50.041-->00:31:55.313
is possible and basically cover
their tracks. [audience
chuckles] Hah. So and for a full

00:31:55.313-->00:32:00.252
year and a half it was listed on
a BBS on one of the BBS lists as
an open BBS for the com-

00:32:03.655-->00:32:09.961
community. And I mentioned that
uh one of the ISPs uh went
bankrupt '95. So that ISP is

00:32:09.961-->00:32:14.966
called DataServ, obviously no
longer with us. The CEO of the
Dataserv was called GiIl Benun.

00:32:17.169-->00:32:22.174
His password is IMGBN1 maybe I
should apologize uh years later.
Uh and and the interesting thing

00:32:26.878-->00:32:30.715
is how was that discovered? Just
remember the old days. It was
slash dot slash net you could

00:32:30.715-->00:32:35.720
listen in on the network
interface and that was clear
text being posted. So that

00:32:35.720-->00:32:40.725
episode was was absolutely open
for fairly long while. >>So um
how did we learn? Back then,

00:32:43.161-->00:32:47.132
there wasn't internet we
actually had to buy books. Uh
and sometimes wait for them for

00:32:47.132-->00:32:51.736
a long time, because you went to
the store either it was there or
he didn't know it existed. Um

00:32:51.736-->00:32:56.374
the thing on the left you see
Machshavot hose were very
elementary books I think many of

00:32:56.374-->00:33:02.914
us started our computer uh
education there. That was mostly
Basic and sometimes uh Logo and

00:33:02.914-->00:33:08.019
Pascal. Uh I learned to
understand a simple language
from the book in the middle uh

00:33:08.019-->00:33:13.191
and Pascal from the book over
there. And that led rather
quickly at least with the

00:33:13.191-->00:33:18.630
curious guys to reverse
engineering. Because we wanted
to know why things happened how

00:33:18.630-->00:33:23.935
they happened and how we can
modify them to our benefit. Uh
one of the reasons we did that

00:33:23.935-->00:33:27.772
was to contribute back to the
community. There was also a
community back then, if you guys

00:33:27.772-->00:33:32.611
recognize this, this is the
Ralph Brown interrupt list. Back
then this was like the Holy

00:33:32.611-->00:33:37.616
Grail of inter ops uh on the
8086 platform and uh I made some
contribution I would reverse

00:33:40.185-->00:33:46.925
engineer my bios, I don't know
why I did that. Umm but I did.
And then uh one day Eden comes

00:33:46.925-->00:33:52.297
to me already back then we has
delegating and he said "Inbar
how bout you write uh a piece

00:33:52.297-->00:33:58.970
about uh anti-debugging tricks?"
And I actually did, umm not
entirely by myself, and actually

00:33:58.970-->00:34:03.508
th- this can be found all over
the internet. Um back then we
didn't think that you know that

00:34:03.508-->00:34:09.147
this stuff was gonna be recorded
but complete archives of emails
and EchoMails are somewhere to

00:34:09.147-->00:34:14.586
be found and this is all over
the internet and we have an
exclusive we're gonna release

00:34:14.586-->00:34:19.925
the 6th edition that was never
actually published. Ehh I
actually found it uhh in my

00:34:19.925-->00:34:24.930
stuff. Now reverse engineering
was not only code. Uh these are
two games by Microprose. I liked

00:34:26.965-->00:34:31.970
flights simulators my dad used
to be a pilot and it turns out
the uh engine on these two games

00:34:34.205-->00:34:38.877
is identical which means that
all of the data files are
identical. Now they didn't have

00:34:38.877-->00:34:45.317
the same umm uh places you could
fly, right? One of them had the
Persian gulf and the other one

00:34:45.317-->00:34:50.989
had, Eur- uh I don't know uh,
South Africa. And you wanted to
do both. So we figured out that

00:34:50.989-->00:34:55.994
you could just copy the files
and then enjoy all the arenas in
the same game. >>So games were,

00:34:58.396-->00:35:03.468
were a major part of growing up
much like everyone here and this
guy has is one of the biggest

00:35:03.468-->00:35:08.106
contributors to that in Israel.
This is I showed his picture
initially, Asi Azulay 1 Man

00:35:08.106-->00:35:14.379
Crew. The really zero day the
original zero day intent ha
meaning of it which is these are

00:35:14.379-->00:35:19.551
the we- the latest wares that
you can find. And that was on on
on his BBS. Now the problem is

00:35:19.551-->00:35:26.024
or the thing that was really
annoying is that he was [music
plays] putting in intros, demos

00:35:26.024-->00:35:32.130
before the games that he was
distributing. So that was really
annoying, alright, so. Uh just

00:35:32.130-->00:35:37.736
to take credit, so we we
inspected the code and found
which bytes to change to jump

00:35:37.736-->00:35:42.741
and just to get rid of that and,
and that started a war and well
here I can say we, that's this

00:35:45.243-->00:35:51.883
kind of a we. Um so we found how
to to reverse engineer and rem-
remove that code but then they

00:35:51.883-->00:35:57.589
added self modifying code and
encrypting of the intro which
was a real bummer so what we did

00:35:57.589-->00:36:03.328
if people here are code assembly
uh we actually captured into 10
and 10 is a transr- eh the

00:36:03.328-->00:36:09.067
changing to mode 13 which was
the VGA mode because they needed
that to do the demo. And would

00:36:09.067-->00:36:15.106
just send failure. [crowd
chuckles] So nevermind how they
he encrypted the code nevermind

00:36:15.106-->00:36:19.511
what they did the demo just
wouldn't come come up so then as
soon as the game goes and does

00:36:19.511-->00:36:26.351
mode 10, mode 13 and and 10 fine
yeah go ahead, let's play the
game. >>And we called it, as you

00:36:26.351-->00:36:31.356
can see unAsi. >>[laughs] >>Now
uh Asi wasn't the only one using
uh uh file uh compressors there

00:36:35.160-->00:36:40.165
were many of them you had Ice
and uh uh PK Lite and some of
them had versions that didn't

00:36:42.834-->00:36:47.839
have extractors and one of those
was TINYPROG. TINYPROG um was uh
created by uh Alex Robinson and

00:36:51.843-->00:36:56.848
there was no decrypter for that
so uh I wrote one, uh also not
entirely by myself. And it

00:36:58.883-->00:37:04.222
actually worked and back then
when you contacted someone it
was by sending them a letter. I

00:37:04.222-->00:37:09.194
actually found a guy. His
company was called Trenzoa, I
sent him a letter and he kindly

00:37:09.194-->00:37:14.966
asked me not to uh give the
source away. He said "This is
how I make my uh, my income.

00:37:14.966-->00:37:19.404
Please don't spread it because
people buy the product and I
want it to keep working." And I

00:37:19.404-->00:37:24.409
uh I actually agreed and at a
certain stage... >>hmm yeah I I
was uh I was cracking games for

00:37:26.911-->00:37:31.916
a living. Uh if you played uh
Larry Suit Larry [crowd laughs]
VGA edition ummm so but so

00:37:35.320-->00:37:41.426
TINYPROG was a problem. And so
Inbar was visiting me one day
and I uh found a source code and

00:37:41.426-->00:37:46.431
I copied that over. Umm. >>Stole
it. >>Yes. Well, copied. Zero
cost. Um and then the the the

00:37:49.400-->00:37:54.305
crazy amazing thing is that we
did have the relationship in
place for him to, just before

00:37:54.305-->00:37:59.377
leaving, say "I just want to run
something on your computer." And
he did a find to the file size

00:37:59.377-->00:38:01.312
the byte file size of
UnTINYPROG. And found it on my
drive. >>Oh so but but that did

00:38:01.312-->00:38:06.317
start a fight. Right so >>A
friendly fight. >>A friendly
fight, so um this is um a crack

00:38:11.723-->00:38:16.728
for a uh software called Oren.
Oren was the primary typewriter
in Israel at the time. And they

00:38:19.964-->00:38:25.703
had a really good protection
system uh it was actually a
parallel port driver that you'd

00:38:25.703-->00:38:32.243
you'd put in and it had part of
the challenge response it had
part of the code in it and so

00:38:32.243-->00:38:38.383
because Inbar was refusing to
give me TINYPROG, UnTINYPROG so
I wrote Openall. Openall was an

00:38:38.383-->00:38:42.887
X86 virtual machine that would
listen that would emulate the
running of the software find

00:38:42.887-->00:38:47.892
when to capture the executable
but also um log the parallel
port. Hence, uh the cracked

00:38:50.128-->00:38:56.334
Oren. The interesting thing like
we we found all these while
doing the research uh for this

00:38:56.334-->00:39:01.773
uh the interesting thing is I
guess you all know Phrack,
right, that's uh one of the holy

00:39:01.773-->00:39:06.778
bibles. Uh and Europe used to
have no idea who that was, wrote
a summary about the Israeli

00:39:09.414-->00:39:14.419
scene. Now if you look back, see
this is before prefect, that was
me. HaSP was my group and Phrack

00:39:19.424-->00:39:23.628
is talking about for the sake of
the Pirates, and Israeli foreign
group that also has American

00:39:23.628-->00:39:28.633
members is called HaSP. HaSP was
a group of 1. No American
members whatsoever but I did

00:39:32.003-->00:39:37.008
have a Phrack mention. Uh so so
from from all those cracking uh
started a new community called

00:39:39.978-->00:39:44.048
the Demo Scene in Israel. It was
mostly newer there there wasn't
much of a demo scene in the US

00:39:44.048-->00:39:50.021
which is interesting. And um at
one point I became the coding
coordinator of ICE. The Insane

00:39:50.021-->00:39:54.659
Creator Enterprise, which up
until that point we're just
creating ANSI so we were the

00:39:54.659-->00:40:00.632
first VGA coders on that
platform. And you see that he's
actually crediting 3 Israelis

00:40:00.632-->00:40:07.338
that joined uh the group at that
point. And this is one, uh Thom
Sofati one of the best engineers

00:40:07.338-->00:40:11.843
I know to this date, an
entrepreneur in a in a group
called Simply. This is Eaton

00:40:11.843-->00:40:16.848
Chaken he now is one of the
leaders of uh uh what was Yahoo
uh in Israel. And that was me.

00:40:19.751-->00:40:22.887
But the interesting thing is
that we were clueless at the
time that there was another

00:40:22.887-->00:40:28.893
group or a group of people that
were about dozen two dozen
people that were doing demos in

00:40:28.893-->00:40:33.698
Israel but were not
communicating with one another.
So these people are are awesome

00:40:33.698-->00:40:38.703
engineers to this date and this
guy is one of the best Mod and
S3M trackers to date and he's

00:40:41.439-->00:40:46.711
part of a group called Infected
Mushroom. People know? [crowd
noise] Yeah! So that was the

00:40:46.711-->00:40:52.750
demo scene, right? It's it's
pretty crazy seeing that from
the guy, eh Erez Eisen. >>Uh the

00:40:52.750-->00:40:57.755
virus scene was a very uh
interesting place to be in the
'90s and Israel did play a role

00:41:00.391-->00:41:05.396
also in the virus writing ummm
let's call it scene. Uh the most
famous uh 2 are the Jerusalem

00:41:07.665-->00:41:12.570
and the Haifa, remember we're
talking back then there was a
distinction between a virus and

00:41:12.570-->00:41:17.575
a worm and a trojan, so these 2
there was some local initiatives
people wrote um um malware to uh

00:41:21.713-->00:41:28.186
inject uh cuss words into uh
their uh school computers. But
most of what we were doing in

00:41:28.186-->00:41:33.057
Israel was actually on the good
side. Uh if you look at the
anti-virus history you can see

00:41:33.057-->00:41:38.963
that uh a lot of companies were
actually based in Israel. One of
these companies uh one of the

00:41:38.963-->00:41:45.103
writers, Gilad Japhet is the uh
cofounder and CEO of uh
MyHeritage,uh one of the largest

00:41:45.103-->00:41:51.442
uh genome mapping companies was
it. Um so some more collect-
from my collection uh these are

00:41:51.442-->00:41:56.447
actually floppies of uh AVs,
this one is by Iris and we had
uh virus safe as well. And there

00:41:58.649-->00:42:04.455
was actually one that was uh
written by two guys Yuval Tal
and Uzi Apple uh you can see on

00:42:04.455-->00:42:08.860
the right Yuval Tal writing in
one of the EchoMail channels
that he's looking for some

00:42:08.860-->00:42:14.766
assistance. And then Uzi Apple
joined the military so I was
called in to replace him. So for

00:42:14.766-->00:42:19.771
a while I was actually writing
uh uh AV engines, and that was
'92 and an interesting story the

00:42:22.373-->00:42:28.679
Hypha virus I actually found it
on my uh school computer and it
was the first one of the first

00:42:28.679-->00:42:34.552
that was self encrypting self
modifying. It was very very
advanced uh at the time and I

00:42:34.552-->00:42:38.689
did a complete reverse
engineering of that. And I hope
you can see what it says, I'm

00:42:38.689-->00:42:43.694
I'm so uh so proud of myself uh
just read the first sentence
really it's pure gold and uh I

00:42:46.798-->00:42:51.836
wrote I created the generic
signature and I sent it to the
AV company and the interesting

00:42:51.836-->00:42:56.841
story is that uh not so many
years later I ended up uhh
serving in one of the units in

00:42:58.910-->00:43:04.215
the military and one of my
colleagues uh admitted that he
was the guy who wrote the virus.

00:43:04.215-->00:43:09.887
So it's a small world. This is
the signature. It was uh very
interesting. Now as far as

00:43:09.887-->00:43:16.260
carding goes I'll just say a few
words. Um there were 2 big
engines called CVI and TRW, they

00:43:16.260-->00:43:20.865
had a lot of credit information,
they were completely
unprotected, many people had

00:43:20.865-->00:43:26.404
access to that and they shared
that. There was some ethical
line in Israel between you know

00:43:26.404-->00:43:31.642
getting information and trading
it and actually using it. Using
other people's credit crumb er

00:43:31.642-->00:43:36.647
credit card was frowned upon.
And let's also talk about uh
some famous busts. Deri

00:43:38.850-->00:43:45.656
Schreibman the was the first uh
casuality in Israel. He was
caught back in '91 it was the

00:43:45.656-->00:43:50.194
first time that the police
actually tackled this whole
thing that we were doing. Uh it

00:43:50.194-->00:43:56.234
was said that he had technology
that was never seen before by
law enforcement. We had the The

00:43:56.234-->00:44:02.306
Aanalyzer this guy didn't learn
from his mistakes and actually
fell back into crime a number of

00:44:02.306-->00:44:08.379
times and someone told me this
week that he might actually be
uh uh in custody as we speak.

00:44:08.379-->00:44:15.086
This is a story from Eden.
>>Yeah it's a so this guy was
caught because he put a Trojan

00:44:15.086-->00:44:19.590
on his ex wife's machine who
then suspected because he had
information that he shouldn't

00:44:19.590-->00:44:24.595
have had. Interesting story but
then that actually blew up and
apparently more than 8 different

00:44:26.797-->00:44:31.802
private investigators in Israel
used the same trojan in order to
steal data from the largest

00:44:31.802-->00:44:37.942
corporates. So by him being
stupid and putting it on his ex-
wife's computer he actually

00:44:37.942-->00:44:44.549
destroyed his own business which

to private investigators. >>And

00:44:44.549-->00:44:49.787

this is actually a minor uh this
this happened in the states. He

00:44:49.787-->00:44:56.394
was making bomb threat calls,
got arrested. Uh recent history,
many of these people ended up in

00:44:56.394-->00:45:02.366
uh military intelligence. Uh the
pioneer generation actually
brought the knowledge with them,

00:45:02.366-->00:45:08.506
the younger ones picked it up
there. And Checkpoint was the
first companies that was founded

00:45:08.506-->00:45:12.577
based on stuff that people
learned in the military. This
happened in '93 and you can see

00:45:12.577-->00:45:16.714
a long list of companies that
were formed by military
colleagues, people that met in

00:45:16.714-->00:45:22.720
the Army and had comradeship and
they shared you know work and
knowledge and they trusted each

00:45:22.720-->00:45:29.293
