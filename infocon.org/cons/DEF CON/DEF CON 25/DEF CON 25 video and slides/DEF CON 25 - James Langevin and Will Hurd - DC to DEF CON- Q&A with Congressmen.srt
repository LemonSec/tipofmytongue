00:00:00.000-->00:00:05.672
>>Welcome to Def Con! [clears
throat] Alright, uh, do you guys
believe thes-the hacker's been

00:00:05.672-->00:00:10.677
coming to the city- the desert
for 25 times now? Give
yourselves a round of applause

00:00:13.547-->00:00:20.120
for coming to the desert. 25
years. [Applause] So, uh, I
believe we're making history

00:00:20.120-->00:00:24.925
here, this is the first time
sitting congressmen have been to
uh, officially, in official

00:00:24.925-->00:00:30.297
capacity speakers at, uh, the
largest hacker conference in the
world. So that to me, looks like

00:00:30.297-->00:00:36.036
some progress. Uhm, we're going
to do some introductions in a
minute, uh, first things first,

00:00:36.036-->00:00:42.342
we're going to do a little
framing to explain why we were
able to get, uh, these two

00:00:42.342-->00:00:47.114
distinguished, uh, public
servants to our conference. So,
we've been coming here 25 years

00:00:47.114-->00:00:51.351
and we are not necessarily a
single tribe. And a lot of the
outside world thinks a hacker

00:00:51.351-->00:00:56.623
equals a criminal, and I think
over the last few years we've
been turning that tide, and now

00:00:56.623-->00:01:01.628
they understand there's a-
hacking is just a form of power,
it's like magic and we can use

00:01:01.628-->00:01:06.233
it for good, for ill, for any
number of purposes, and one of
the ways we've been trying to

00:01:06.233-->00:01:12.139
turn that tide is explaining why
we do what we do. And we all
have different motives, not

00:01:12.139-->00:01:17.911
everyone in here is the same,
but you know alliteration works,
short lists work, so we have

00:01:17.911-->00:01:23.817
these five P's. We basically say
some people are protectors. They
want to get stuff fixed, they

00:01:23.817-->00:01:28.855
want to make the world a better
place. Some people are puzzlers,
that's why most of us got into

00:01:28.855-->00:01:31.825
this in the first place right,
we want to tinker, we want to
take it apart we want to put it

00:01:31.825-->00:01:38.432
back together. We're curious.
Curiosity is our original
motivation. Some of us do this

00:01:38.432-->00:01:42.336
cause we want to win the white
jacket or we want to be famous.
We do it for prestige or for

00:01:42.336-->00:01:48.475
pride. And there's nothing wrong
with that. It's allowing us to
achieve great things. Some of us

00:01:48.475-->00:01:54.214
do this for profit or
personal/professional gain. And
we make a career out of it. And

00:01:54.214-->00:01:59.186
Some of us do this for a protest
for or against some ideological
cause that we care deeply about.

00:01:59.186-->00:02:04.224
Ideally within the bounds of the
laws. So whether you're
motivated by being a protector,

00:02:04.224-->00:02:09.830
a puzzler, a prestige/profit, or
protest. You know we're
complicated individuals but

00:02:09.830-->00:02:15.402
there's a reason you got in
thins in the first place and
there's a reason you stay in it.

00:02:15.402-->00:02:19.740
So for my part, I wanna make the
world a safer place. So I'm
first and foremost a protector,

00:02:19.740-->00:02:24.711
and like luckily over the last
several years we've met several
of you that feel the same, but

00:02:24.711-->00:02:29.082
you know I also like hard
problems, so I'm a bit of a
puzzler as well. And uh, we're

00:02:29.082-->00:02:33.653
gonna ask these congressmen
during their intros, why did you
get into public service in the

00:02:33.653-->00:02:39.393
first place? What's your
motivation? Now, in the spirit
of that 4 years ago here at Def

00:02:39.393-->00:02:43.530
Con we launch I am the cavalry.
this was this idea that could we
be the voice of the reason, an

00:02:43.530-->00:02:49.636
ambassador, a translator, should
we bring Def Con to DC? Should
we try to be a voice of

00:02:49.636-->00:02:54.041
translating the things we care
about, specifically were ever
there is issues of public safety

00:02:54.041-->00:02:58.478
and human life. The idea is
could we shift from being a
pointing finger at pass failure

00:02:58.478-->00:03:04.384
to a helping hand towards future
success. Can we stop celebrating
failure and what wrong with

00:03:04.384-->00:03:09.423
something and look for what's
right with something, uh,
and-and through that we focus

00:03:09.423-->00:03:15.195
more on empathy and
communication then we did on
breaking things. And because of

00:03:15.195-->00:03:21.301
that we've slowly, slowly made
ourselves accessible to public
policy makers and whether you

00:03:21.301-->00:03:26.473
guys knew this or not over that
last 2 years there are 18 parts
of the US government who

00:03:26.473-->00:03:33.180
enthusiastically support and
encourage the use of coordinated
vulnerability disclosure so not

00:03:33.180-->00:03:37.851
only is what you're doing is not
criminalized in all cases and
were slowly turning the tide on

00:03:37.851-->00:03:42.889
that with things like the
Digital Millennium Copyright Act
exemptions, but they also see us

00:03:42.889-->00:03:49.129
as a vital resource and a
teammate if done right. One of
these two gentlemen on stage on

00:03:49.129-->00:03:55.735
the floor of congress said "Go
hack the pentagon." So I think
we're turning the tide and this

00:03:55.735-->00:03:59.306
is something I think is worth a
little bit of cheers for
yourselves and for others.

00:04:07.581-->00:04:12.719
[Applause] Now, there's a loong
way to go. Uh, last year was
pretty hot for first of a kind

00:04:12.719-->00:04:17.491
policy engagement on cyber
security issues. Yes, I said
cyber but A, I did my friggin

00:04:17.491-->00:04:22.496
shot and B, uh, this is the
language they speak on the hill,
and if we want to be effective

00:04:24.498-->00:04:28.869
you know, when you're in France
you speak french, right so we
have to harmonize the way we

00:04:28.869-->00:04:33.273
speak about things, but you know
legislative and executive branch
alone we saw the food and drug

00:04:33.273-->00:04:38.411
administration really tighten up
things like medical advice cyber
safety we saw the department of

00:04:38.411-->00:04:43.183
transportation do this, we saw
commerce encourage disclosure
and patching best practices.

00:04:43.183-->00:04:49.456
DHS, white house and congress
themselves also asked, almost
presciently, they said "we're

00:04:49.456-->00:04:53.260
concerned about over
connectivity and security risks
in our health care which is a

00:04:53.260-->00:04:57.464
sixth of our economy." So while
we were all talking about
information sharing in the CISA

00:04:57.464-->00:05:03.470
Act of 2015 they also asked for
one year of congressional task
force, and in that they wanted a

00:05:03.470-->00:05:10.377
diverse number of stakeholders
to say "How risky is connective
medicine?" and on June of this

00:05:10.377-->00:05:14.414
year we published this. They
actually made sure they wanted a
voice of hackers so I and the

00:05:14.414-->00:05:19.119
cavalry and a lot of the hacker
community got to participate in
this one year long task force.

00:05:19.119-->00:05:23.056
Now, I'm going to saw some stuff
that's a little scary so we can
ground this group in why we're

00:05:23.056-->00:05:28.862
having them here today. So, of
the many thing we found, the
punchline was that healthcare is

00:05:28.862-->00:05:34.100
in critical condition and
whether you can read this
graphic or not the 5 things on

00:05:34.100-->00:05:39.606
the front page of this report
are essentially, about 85% of
our US health delivery

00:05:39.606-->00:05:45.912
organization lack a single
qualified security person on
staff. That should scare

00:05:45.912-->00:05:50.717
everybody. And this is not a US
only problem we talked with our
international partners. Number

00:05:50.717-->00:05:57.057
2, we tend to be defending
legacy XP or older in the leg-
in the-in the clinical

00:05:57.057-->00:05:59.960
environment so these things a
well past their end of life
where they're no longer

00:05:59.960-->00:06:04.364
supported. Number 3, they tend
to be over connected to each
other and reachable by the

00:06:04.364-->00:06:09.069
outside world..which means that
a single flaw in a single device
could take out and entire

00:06:09.069-->00:06:13.874
hospital as you saw with
Hollywood Presbyterian last
February. And more over the

00:06:13.874-->00:06:18.378
average device in a clinical
environment has over 1-->000 known
vulnerabilities. So put those

00:06:18.378-->00:06:22.949
together, most of our hospitals
lack a single one of you, you're
defending harder to defend

00:06:22.949-->00:06:27.587
things, they're over connected
to each other and reachable by
the outside world, a single flaw

00:06:27.587-->00:06:31.625
in a single device took out
patient care at Hollywood
Presbyterian Hospital, and the

00:06:31.625-->00:06:37.497
average device may give us 1-->000
chances to do it. We've done
amazing things over the last 25

00:06:37.497-->00:06:43.503
years but we need more of you.
To help us solve these wicked
problems and if there wasn't a

00:06:43.503-->00:06:48.742
sense of urgency as we were
publishing this report back to
congress, WannaCry took out 65

00:06:48.742-->00:06:53.747
hospitals in a single day. That
was 20% of their national
capacity. You now people died

00:06:56.449-->00:07:02.455
from degraded and delayed
patient care. So, I wanna call
out to the best of you, as we

00:07:02.455-->00:07:07.994
reach out to the best of them,
and in the spirit of that I
think we've proven the model to

00:07:07.994-->00:07:13.500
work over the last 4 years,
bringing Def Con to D.C. In fact
some of us have actually quit

00:07:13.500-->00:07:17.937
our day jobs and moved into
think tanks like the Atlantic
Counsel and what not. And now

00:07:17.937-->00:07:22.742
we've brought part of D.C here
to Def Con in a way that hasn't
been done before and I am

00:07:22.742-->00:07:29.616
honored and humbled that we have
two sitting members of our
democratic process here. So

00:07:29.616-->00:07:34.621
please, I'll introduce them in a
moment, but let's give it a huge
round of applause for these two

00:07:44.831-->00:07:49.936
pioneers. [Applause] All right,
we're going to try and keep an
eye on the hashtag if you wanna

00:07:49.936-->00:07:55.008
send me your poll answers and
what not, uh, Def Con- uh DC2
Def Con, uh, first

00:07:55.008-->00:08:01.614
representative James Langevin,
he will give his own intro, but
I was uh, really excited to work

00:08:01.614-->00:08:07.220
with him as the chair and
founder- co-chair of the cyber
caucus in the house of

00:08:07.220-->00:08:12.225
representatives. And also
representative Hurd of Texas who
uh, also a very strong and

00:08:14.728-->00:08:19.599
leading and informed voice on
cyber security issues and Ill
you them tell you their origin

00:08:19.599-->00:08:24.404
stories but please gentlemen
weave in which of the
motivations do you carry to

00:08:24.404-->00:08:30.744
public service? So, you first
representative Langevin.
>>Alright, well thank you very

00:08:30.744-->00:08:35.749
much Josh, for the introduction,
for the invitation to join you
today and uh, and uh, I wanna

00:08:38.084-->00:08:44.090
thank both you and Def Con and
let me also recognise BOW and
uh, the Atlantic Counsel for

00:08:44.090-->00:08:49.095
everything you did to make our
visit here possible and uh, let
me just say to the security

00:08:51.297-->00:08:57.137
researchers community, thank you
all for what you do and uh, I
know that collaboratively

00:08:57.137-->00:09:02.008
together we're going to make a
difference in this field and
we're going to make the uh, the

00:09:02.008-->00:09:08.448
internet much more secure than
it is today and we're gonna do
it together. So I thank you for

00:09:08.448-->00:09:15.288
that I know it's a challenging,
uh, environment, for sure,
dynamic one but I find it an

00:09:15.288-->00:09:20.293
amazing topic to work on. I am
thrilled to be here with my
colleague, Will Hurd, uh, Will

00:09:22.328-->00:09:27.333
and served on the Homeland
Security committee together, and
uh, let it be recognized here

00:09:29.702-->00:09:34.707
that I can tell you my
partisanship is not dead on the
hill there are pockets that

00:09:34.707-->00:09:41.281
still exist and guys like will
and I hopefully are helping set
an example and helping to raise

00:09:41.281-->00:09:47.387
the bar to show that by working
together that's how we truly get
things done. So, great to be

00:09:47.387-->00:09:52.392
here with my colleague..So
[Light Applause] >>Clap, You can
clap for that [Applause] >>So,

00:09:56.129-->00:10:01.634
just to brief you a little about
myself, uhm, So I am a
congressman from the 2nd

00:10:01.634-->00:10:08.074
district of Rhode Island. I'm in
my 9th term in congress and I
sit on both the uh the senior

00:10:08.074-->00:10:12.112
memb- the House Armed Services
Committee and a founding member
and senior member of the

00:10:12.112-->00:10:17.584
Homeland Security Committee. Uh,
in all of that work, I
specialize in-in cyber security

00:10:17.584-->00:10:22.555
and uh, the ranking member on
the emerging threats and
capabilities subcommittee on

00:10:22.555-->00:10:28.194
armed services. We have primary
jurisdiction over NSA and US
cyber command and uh, the

00:10:28.194-->00:10:33.299
Homeland Security Committee, I
sit on the subcommand in cyber
security and infrastructure

00:10:33.299-->00:10:37.871
protection. But I have to tell
you, I kind of fell into
this-this world of being

00:10:37.871-->00:10:44.544
involved in cyber security uh,
about of a decade ago, when I
was the chairman of the

00:10:44.544-->00:10:50.350
subcommittee on emerging
threats, cybersecurity and
science and technology and

00:10:50.350-->00:10:55.955
originally I thought we were
going to be focusing mainly on
the emerging threats part of the

00:10:55.955-->00:11:01.394
responsibility which was to look
at all the, uh, the most serious
threats to the face of the

00:11:01.394-->00:11:05.765
country such as chemical,
biological, radiological, and
nuclear threats to a, to

00:11:05.765-->00:11:10.770
America, and our allies. And
then uh, one day my staff
director uh came into me on the

00:11:13.339-->00:11:19.646
sub committee and said uh boss
you're gonna get a briefing on
this thing called the Aurora

00:11:19.646-->00:11:24.617
threat, uh, by two, found,
discovered by two uh,
researchers at Idaho National

00:11:24.617-->00:11:30.156
Labs where they found a
vulnerability into a-into a
critical infrastructure through

00:11:30.156-->00:11:35.161
a a-a skater attack, and hence
everyone knows that as the
Aurora threat but uh, I was

00:11:38.097-->00:11:43.636
riveted by the video that showed
how a generator operating
normally all of a sudden because

00:11:43.636-->00:11:50.543
of a a-a malicious code that was
remotely inserted caused this
generator to spin up out of

00:11:50.543-->00:11:55.548
control and then basically shake
itself apart and uh, and that
was just a small example of what

00:11:58.084-->00:12:03.022
could happen to, uhm, to our
electric grid if in potentially
shutting down a whole portion of

00:12:05.458-->00:12:10.463
our country's electric grid if a
successful widespread skater
attack were to be carried out.

00:12:13.199-->00:12:18.204
So that is how my interest in
cyber began. And just to close
out, from there we were asked

00:12:22.475-->00:12:27.780
Mike McCaul and I, uh, my co
founder and co chair of the
cybersecurity caucus, Mike now

00:12:27.780-->00:12:31.784
chairs the full Homeland
Security Committee, but he's
been a great, again bipartisan

00:12:31.784-->00:12:36.489
partner in this-in this effort
to enhance our nation's
cybersecurity uh, he and I were

00:12:36.489-->00:12:42.195
asked to chair b-be co-chairs of
a national commission the CSIS
commission, on cybersecurity for

00:12:42.195-->00:12:47.500
the 44th presidency, which
became the foundational document
for president Obama as he

00:12:47.500-->00:12:53.539
charted the nation's
cybersecurity uh, blueprint and
plan going forward, and uhm, and

00:12:53.539-->00:12:59.846
then we also you know, founded
the a- co-founded the
cybersecurity caucus. And, when

00:12:59.846-->00:13:04.017
we originally started in this
field i have to tell you we got
a lot of funny looks Mike and I

00:13:04.017-->00:13:09.022
we felt like we had a lone voice
in the wilderness and uh, people
did not understand the-the what

00:13:11.457-->00:13:16.462
we were so worked up about. They
get it now. Times have certainly
changed uhm, but we still have a

00:13:19.966-->00:13:24.904
lot of work to do. Clearly the
awareness has been raised but
now we've got to continue to

00:13:24.904-->00:13:29.876
work together to close the
vulnerabilities. So, that is a,
just briefly, probably went on

00:13:29.876-->00:13:35.748
too long, sorry, but uhm,
that's-that's my introduction to
the cybersecurity challenges

00:13:35.748-->00:13:40.753
that the nation faces and uh,
and uh, it's a continued work in
progress but i have a, been

00:13:43.690-->00:13:48.695
really gratified to know there
are people like you in the
security research community who

00:13:51.230-->00:13:55.668
are doing important work
discovering vulnerabilities and
I'm hoping that we continue for

00:13:55.668-->00:14:00.873
stronger partnerships uh to help
do something about it when we
find those vulnerabilities and

00:14:00.873-->00:14:04.677
uh as I said I know that we're
going to be able to do this
together, Will's been a great

00:14:04.677-->00:14:08.848
partner, in this a- in this
effort, and I'm pleased again to
share the stage with him but I

00:14:08.848-->00:14:13.853
want to thank you for your
invitation and it's an honor to
be with you today. Thankyou.

00:14:21.060-->00:14:26.065
[Applause] >>Which P are you
Jim? Put the list back up. >>
Yeah I'm the one that fixes

00:14:31.637-->00:14:36.642
thing. >>It's definitely not
prestige right [Laughter] Ah,
yeah that's when you have a 9

00:14:39.579-->00:14:46.152
percent job approval rating,
uhm, that's not prestige.[Crowd
Laughing] uhm, anyways, not us

00:14:46.152-->00:14:52.925
individually back home
obviously, right, but as a body,
as a body. Am I too far away

00:14:52.925-->00:14:57.930
from this? How do we get that
echo out? Anyone? >>[From crowd]
Pull it back >>Pull it back?

00:15:00.399-->00:15:05.404
This way? Uhm, well, again,
thanks for having us here, this
is my second time to-to to Def

00:15:10.676-->00:15:15.681
Con and I always take a lot away
from the interactions that we
have especially on the sidelines

00:15:18.785-->00:15:25.091
of many of these events. And I
appreciate the Atlantic Counsel
for making this happen and

00:15:25.091-->00:15:32.064
getting us out here to Las
Vegas. Uhm, let me see a show of
hands, How many- if this is your

00:15:32.064-->00:15:37.069
first Def Con? Okay, wow, a lot
of noobs a lot a [light claps]
Yeah, give it up for the

00:15:41.974-->00:15:46.979
noobies! [Applause] How manys
been here over 5 years? Okay,
over 10? We got any of the

00:15:50.183-->00:15:55.188
originals? No, No originals?
What, DT ain't here? DT didn't
want to come uh, here or talk?

00:15:57.557-->00:16:02.161
>>They're all on duty [Laughter]
>>Yeah, uh, you just came here
cause you drank too much last

00:16:02.161-->00:16:07.400
night and need somewhere c-cold
to hangout? Anyone? Okay, I
appreciate that, I appreciate

00:16:07.400-->00:16:13.439
the honesty. Uhm, So, I'm from
San Antonio born and raised and
[light cheers from crowd] A lot

00:16:13.439-->00:16:19.679
of San Antonians there you go.
Uhm, and my, when I was in
highschool I had the opportunity

00:16:19.679-->00:16:25.084
to take a internship at the
southwest research institute and
I had a female engineer[cheer

00:16:25.084-->00:16:31.390
from crowd] that exposed me,
yeah? Female engineers? Give it
up. [Applause] Exposed me to

00:16:31.390-->00:16:37.697
robotics and is the reason that
I first got interested in
computer science and I studied

00:16:37.697-->00:16:43.135
it at Texas A&M and [cheers from
crowd] Yeah whoop gigamaggies!
It's our year, it's our year.

00:16:43.135-->00:16:48.140
Uh, watch out Alabama [Crowd
Laughing] Uhm, and so also if
you need a turbo pascal or

00:16:51.210-->00:16:56.215
fortran programmer let me know
[Crowd Laughing] Uhm, I sorta
know a few things. And I had the

00:16:58.584-->00:17:03.522
opportunity, when I graduated, I
went into the C.I.A. Uhm, I was
a case officer. I did 2 years in

00:17:06.325-->00:17:11.197
Washington D.C at what I used to
call the super secret C.I.A
training facility called "The

00:17:11.197-->00:17:17.069
Farm". Uh, now it's on google
maps and, uh [Crowd laughter],
uh, two years Indian, two years

00:17:17.069-->00:17:22.041
in Pakistan, two years in New
York City, a year in a half in
Afghanistan where I managed all

00:17:22.041-->00:17:25.978
of our undercover operations. So
I was the dude in the back
allies at 4 o'clock in the

00:17:25.978-->00:17:31.651
morning collecting, uhm,
intelligence on threats to our
home land and I also had a brief

00:17:31.651-->00:17:38.357
members of congress. Had I met a
guy like Jim, I probably would
have stayed in the C.I.A. Uhm, I

00:17:38.357-->00:17:43.362
unfortunately had not been
exposed to Jim and Mike McCaul
and Ted Lieu from California,

00:17:46.098-->00:17:52.571
uh, folks that really understand
the issues that they're talking
about and so I was frustrated

00:17:52.571-->00:17:58.744
with the caliber of our elected
officials and so I ran for
congress in 2010 and I lost.

00:17:58.744-->00:18:03.549
[cheers and laughter] uhm, why
does that always get a jok- get
a laugh? I-I-I still don't

00:18:03.549-->00:18:10.256
understand that. Uhm, and-and I
lost a round off by 700 votes.
And that's not a lot of votes

00:18:10.256-->00:18:14.060
and it's even worse after you've
been to the grocery store for
the 2 months afterwards and

00:18:14.060-->00:18:17.997
people came up to you and say
"How's the campaign?" and [crowd
laughter] uhm, like I lost and

00:18:17.997-->00:18:22.001
they're like oh, shucks we
forgot to-to vote, yah
know?[crowd laughter] I

00:18:22.001-->00:18:27.707
literally ran into 740 people
uh, [Crowd laughter] like that.
Uhm, but it gave me an

00:18:27.707-->00:18:33.713
opportunity to-to work for a
company called Crumpton Group,
uh, Boutique Consulting Firm,

00:18:33.713-->00:18:38.718
and I helped Matt Debow with and
build Fusion X and so if you
don't like anything that I do,

00:18:42.154-->00:18:47.059
see Matt Debow, uhm, he-
everything I've learned in
this-about this industry i've

00:18:47.059-->00:18:52.365
learned from-i've learned from
Debow. And he's a he's-he's-he's
been a good friend and so

00:18:52.365-->00:18:56.102
understanding penetration
testing, technical vulnerability
assessment, things like that,

00:18:56.102-->00:19:02.208
understanding the talent that's
outside of the government, uhm,
understanding the threat that

00:19:02.208-->00:19:08.481
individuals in companies are-are
faced, it was a great experience
and to be able to leverage that

00:19:08.481-->00:19:14.053
when I got in congress. And So,
in 14' I ran again uh, no-
everybody thought I was crazy,

00:19:14.053-->00:19:18.391
uh, nobody thought the black
dude would win in a hispanic
district alright, I represent a

00:19:18.391-->00:19:23.396
71 percent hispanic district and
it's been an opportunity to work
on issues like cybersecurity.

00:19:25.765-->00:19:30.569
And that means in Washington D.C
that actually means information
sharing, uhm, we should have

00:19:30.569-->00:19:36.342
passed a cybersecurity act of
2015, 10 years ago? But we
finally-we finally got something

00:19:36.342-->00:19:41.347
done. Uh, we look-we focus on
privacy and you I said yesterday
i don't know which crypto war

00:19:43.816-->00:19:48.821
we're on right now uhm, but we
should be strengthening
encryption not weakening it.

00:19:52.091-->00:19:57.096
Uhm, [Crowd cheers and applause]
Our civil liberties are not
burdens, they are the things

00:20:01.067-->00:20:06.072
that make our country great. And
we, [crowd applause] we-we can
chase bad guys, we can defend

00:20:10.242-->00:20:13.913
our digital infrastructure, and
we can protect our civil
liberties all at the same time.

00:20:13.913-->00:20:19.085
It's hard. And one of the things
that I have to- that Jim and I
have to do when we educate our

00:20:19.085-->00:20:24.957
colleagues is to let them know
that uhm, guess that there is
really no such thing as an

00:20:24.957-->00:20:30.996
impenetrable device yah know?
Come out to Def Con if you don't
believe us [light laughter]

00:20:30.996-->00:20:37.937
and-and so we have to get to a
point where we can do security
and protect privacy at the same

00:20:37.937-->00:20:42.975
time. And this conversations
will go back and forth right,
this is-ther-this is always the

00:20:42.975-->00:20:47.613
topic of back doors and
encryption is always going to be
out there and you're going to

00:20:47.613-->00:20:53.586
have to continue to-to-to fight
those-fight that back and having
the support of folks like ya'll

00:20:53.586-->00:20:58.591
is-is really important to do
that and I will say everybody
knows now what OPM stands for.

00:21:00.559-->00:21:07.466
>>Oh, yeah [crowd laughter]
>>right, uh, as-as Lindsay
Graham says, mucho bad [light

00:21:07.466-->00:21:12.471
laughter] ya know, uhm,
it's-it's, that brought a
consciousness to this issue that

00:21:16.342-->00:21:21.280
everybody understands the
importance of protecting our
digital infrastructure and our

00:21:21.280-->00:21:27.820
colleagues understand that but
they don't alway necessarily
understand the nuance and that's

00:21:27.820-->00:21:33.559
why we try to educate, that's
why having ya'll is important ya
know, many of our colleagues

00:21:33.559-->00:21:40.099
uhm, think that direct messaging
on twitter is the dark web, ya
know, uhm, [crowd laughter] it's

00:21:40.099-->00:21:45.437
like well no, it's a little more
complicated than that uhm, but
there's-there is a-there's an

00:21:45.437-->00:21:50.442
interest in understanding that
topic and so i always get
nervous when someone says oh,

00:21:52.745-->00:21:58.150
I'm an expert on anything let
alone cybersecurity especially
being in a room with folks like

00:21:58.150-->00:22:03.088
ya'll but coming out here helps
ya know, prevent our knowledge
base from getting stale so I

00:22:05.691-->00:22:11.964
appreciate, yall have been,
everybody has been super nice to
both of us uh, I think everybody

00:22:11.964-->00:22:16.402
was a little worried that we
might have gotten attacked or
something when we got here, uhm,

00:22:16.402-->00:22:22.007
but it really is-it really-
ya'll ya'l have opened- have
welcomed us with open arms and

00:22:22.007-->00:22:27.846
your willingness to help us
understand the big issues and
the small issues and I'm looking

00:22:27.846-->00:22:32.551
forward to talking about some of
those big strategy things that
we have to get right before

00:22:32.551-->00:22:37.556
we're able to do some of
the-some of the small things,
so, Thank you all. [Crowd

00:22:42.294-->00:22:48.000
applause] >>Alright, your
friendly reminder. I put out a
twitter poll it's got probably

00:22:48.000-->00:22:53.606
20 minutes left, maybe 10, uh,
on which topics I should
prioritize amongst Mirai

00:22:53.606-->00:22:59.912
botnets, WannaCry hitting
hospitals, power impacts, or
Wassenaar export controls that

00:22:59.912-->00:23:04.350
may affect our ability to do our
jobs, uh, internationally. So
please vote, I'm gonna keep an

00:23:04.350-->00:23:10.556
eye on it for one of our last
questions. So, uh, yesterday we
had a pretty full line up. These

00:23:10.556-->00:23:15.527
guys are-are-are a very robust
in their ability to take in
information we-we had a lot of

00:23:15.527-->00:23:21.800
briefings yesterday, we took
them on a walking tour of many
of the villages downstairs we

00:23:21.800-->00:23:28.340
saw what, hack- auto hacking
village, lock pick village, IOT,
Industrial Control, the voting

00:23:28.340-->00:23:34.079
machine hacking. >>Roots. >>The
Kids Roots Hackers >>Yeah >> So,
uhm, you know, I know you're

00:23:34.079-->00:23:38.050
both pretty savvy on
cybersecurity but what was a,
what really stood out, what was

00:23:38.050-->00:23:42.488
your biggest surprise, and what
kinda things might you be able
to act upon when you get back to

00:23:42.488-->00:23:47.493
D.C if you wanna continue this
cooperation? >>Uhm, what was I-
the things that I was surprised

00:23:50.396-->00:23:55.401
by is the voting machines and
the fact that all 24 got
dismantled in less than 6 hours.

00:24:00.572-->00:24:05.577
That is- That is a huge problem.
We have to ensure that the
American people can trust their

00:24:10.316-->00:24:16.322
vote tabulating process. And
now, the machine is just one
step in that process, but I

00:24:16.322-->00:24:21.527
think that the work that has
been done out here is important
in educating the secretaries of

00:24:21.527-->00:24:26.832
state, uhm, all across the
country as well as the election
administrators, the people who

00:24:26.832-->00:24:33.605
are tasked with doing this and a
lot of times ya know, I have a
county that's the second least

00:24:33.605-->00:24:40.012
populated county in the United
States of America. 95 people in
the entire county. I've met 72

00:24:40.012-->00:24:45.017
of them. Uhm, and-and they don't
have a cybersecurity
professional to help them, ya

00:24:49.221-->00:24:56.028
know, manage that process and so
figuring out how, uhm, the
states and these election

00:24:56.028-->00:24:59.932
commissioners-uh, election
administrators
are-are-understand the risk and

00:24:59.932-->00:25:04.603
vulnerabilities is important. So
that was important. Uhm, things
that we can take away, I'm

00:25:04.603-->00:25:11.377
interested in doing a hearing on
uhm, the 5 points. Uhm, the 5
points when it comes to-when it

00:25:11.377-->00:25:16.382
comes to connected cars uhm, it
is it is an area that I think we
have to have a little more

00:25:21.053-->00:25:25.724
conversation around because I
want to ensure that we don't
create an overly burdensome

00:25:25.724-->00:25:32.531
regulatory environment around
some of these issues and I think
connected cars is the subsection

00:25:32.531-->00:25:37.536
of IOT that most members can get
their heads around uh, but it's
such a-a-a broader conversation

00:25:40.205-->00:25:44.810
and how do we prevent, I don't
want the government to get in
the way. I want the government

00:25:44.810-->00:25:50.949
to be able to facilitate and to
allow entrepreneurship to grow
but we all know we have to

00:25:50.949-->00:25:56.822
vancane security. Lets not make
the same mistakes that we've
made in the creation of the

00:25:56.822-->00:26:02.294
internet, let's not make those
same mistakes when it comes
to-when it comes to IOT. Uhm,

00:26:02.294-->00:26:07.299
and those are-and look-learning
about TLS 1.3 and ya'lls opinion
on that, and ya'lls opinion on

00:26:11.537-->00:26:17.276
what is the future of Quantum
Computing and the ya know how
quickly is that going to get

00:26:17.276-->00:26:24.283
here on some kind of commercial
scale and how do you defend
against quantum computing.

00:26:24.283-->00:26:29.288
These-these conversations are
going to lead, uhm, me to hold
hearings on many of these topics

00:26:31.857-->00:26:38.263
through the subcommittee that I
chair. >>Excellent, Thankyou.
>>So the thing that surprised me

00:26:38.263-->00:26:43.268
the most, uhm, so uhm, when I
-well ya know many of you have
seen me riding around, and I use

00:26:46.238-->00:26:51.577
an Ibot wheelchair to get around
and I can pop it up on two
wheels, same inventor as the

00:26:51.577-->00:26:56.448
segway scooter, Dean Cabin,
brilliant uh, inventor, uh, The
thing that surprised me the most

00:26:56.448-->00:27:00.118
is that when I went into the car
hacking room, that someone
didn't find a way to hack into

00:27:00.118-->00:27:05.824
my system and start driving me
around [crowd laughter] I did
wonder if it was going to happen

00:27:05.824-->00:27:11.363
and it actually it's a
sophisticated piece of
technology and I uh don't

00:27:11.363-->00:27:15.467
pretend to understand all the
magic but I do know it has 6
gyroscopes that keep it balanced

00:27:15.467-->00:27:20.973
and uh, I did put it down on
four wheels just in case
[laughter] so but a- >> He's

00:27:20.973-->00:27:25.978
here for 4 more hours by the
way. [crowd laughter] >>So, uhm,
so that was the thing that

00:27:28.380-->00:27:33.719
surprised me the most that
didn't happen but uh, thats a
good thing. Uhm, but a, I have

00:27:33.719-->00:27:38.724
to say that, I too was a-a-a-a
surprised, and though not
shocked by the election voting

00:27:46.031-->00:27:51.036
systems and apparently how
easily those systems could be
compromised and hacked uh, I-I

00:27:53.138-->00:27:58.210
knew that they were- that the
electronic voting systems are
uh, potentially vulnerable and

00:27:58.210-->00:28:04.383
I've heard the reports, how easy
it was though was-was an eye
opener. So I was a former

00:28:04.383-->00:28:09.021
secretary of state as well and
before that I served for 6 years
in Rhode Island general assembly

00:28:09.021-->00:28:13.725
as well as a state rep and I
actually chaired a special
legislated commission on

00:28:13.725-->00:28:19.197
purchasing new voting equipment.
And the one thing, all though I
love technology, and I was

00:28:19.197-->00:28:26.171
impressed by the DRE equipment
the touch screen back then at
the time. I could never get

00:28:26.171-->00:28:31.543
passed the fear or the concern
that ya know, what happened if
everything went south and the

00:28:31.543-->00:28:36.548
data was lost. How do you ever
recreate that election? Or prove
t-t-to verify how people voted

00:28:39.017-->00:28:44.022
is actually how th-th-the vote
turned out. An duh, so we
consequently wound up

00:28:47.192-->00:28:53.699
recommending to this- to the
legislature to the governor at
the time, that when we choose

00:28:53.699-->00:28:58.637
the voting equipment that it
should be optical scan so you
can have The best of the old in

00:28:58.637-->00:29:05.477
the new technology but you have
to have the paper ballot as the
ultimate audit trail. Uhm, so

00:29:05.477-->00:29:11.950
that's what we wound up doing
and I was able to uhm, to get
new optical scan voting

00:29:11.950-->00:29:16.355
equipment for the state when I
became secretary of state. But
to see- go in the room and talk

00:29:16.355-->00:29:22.527
to the professors and the-the
researchers who set up the room
and who set up the a the

00:29:22.527-->00:29:28.567
challenge and to hear how easily
the systems were compromised
was-was certainly disturbing and

00:29:28.567-->00:29:34.606
an eye opened and certainly
gives me plause as we go back to
D.C now and a- and and I'm part

00:29:34.606-->00:29:39.878
of a task force to look at a-at
elections and this is certainly
going to be a primary topic of

00:29:39.878-->00:29:46.118
conversation. The other thing
I'll just say and finally . the
one thing that really impressed

00:29:46.118-->00:29:51.123
me, is how the uh, the hacker
community wants to be pro active
yet both identify and closing

00:29:56.461-->00:30:01.466
vulnerabilities in our cyber
ecosystem. So i look forward to
those-growing those

00:30:03.935-->00:30:10.876
opportunities and-and making
sure that we have a way to have
a vulnerability disclosure

00:30:10.876-->00:30:16.014
process at each of the
government agencies I think
that's somet-it's long overdue

00:30:16.014-->00:30:21.019
and that's something that I hope
to work with you all on. >>On
the-[crowd applause] On that

00:30:26.091-->00:30:30.429
last point, Jim ,and I want to
add I-I-I told this story
yesterday, some reporter asked

00:30:30.429-->00:30:36.735
me "you know,are you out here to
get these hacker civically
engaged?" And I was like what

00:30:36.735-->00:30:41.940
are you talking about? They
already are. Right and-and the
feedback and what you all do for

00:30:41.940-->00:30:46.945
society is incredibly important
and we gotta make sure we can
continue to build upon-upo that

00:30:50.015-->00:30:55.020
relationship, so, and I think we
want to try to come back as
often as we can and we'd like to

00:31:00.192-->00:31:05.197
see ya'll up in D.C as well.
[crowd applause] >>So I knew,
yesterday, we had them, uhm, in

00:31:07.733-->00:31:13.071
a small room for 2 hours of
completely unvetted questions
and exchanges. It was amazing,

00:31:13.071-->00:31:18.076
it was magical, I wish we had 2
hours now uh, we're at about the
T-minus 15 minutes mark. Uhm,

00:31:20.712-->00:31:26.118
really quickly, what's an
example-we want examples of uh
positive and negative or

00:31:26.118-->00:31:31.523
effective proactive or reactive
forms of engagement for the
hacker community. And uhm, I-I

00:31:31.523-->00:31:37.529
remember over lunch you were
talking about a good example of
the risk of wassenaar. Can you

00:31:37.529-->00:31:42.534
quickly explain an example how
hackers helped you do your job
and preserve US interest?

00:31:44.903-->00:31:50.542
>>Sure, So, this is something
that I-I tackled pretty
aggressively with my team once

00:31:50.542-->00:31:57.182
we became aware of the problem
and again it was the a the
research community the tech

00:31:57.182-->00:32:02.120
community that came to me
and-and-and made us aware of
what was ya know, I'm sure done

00:32:05.157-->00:32:10.162
with good intentions, missed the
mark uh, Walsh and I are trying
to use a cold war legacy

00:32:12.497-->00:32:17.502
agreement to prevent uh, dual
use technologies from falling
into the-into the wrong hands

00:32:20.305-->00:32:25.310
when you try to uhh, apply that
to software and to uh-
prevention of uh, transfer

00:32:30.015-->00:32:35.020
intrusion control software, but
it missed the mark. It didn't
work and here you had the a

00:32:37.589-->00:32:42.861
department of commerce that was
charged with promulgating the
rules and regulations on how

00:32:42.861-->00:32:47.766
this was going to work uh,
during the common period, but
the researched community really

00:32:47.766-->00:32:53.305
stepped up, the tech community
really stepped up, and made
robust comments and I can tell

00:32:53.305-->00:32:58.310
you I took those comments and
these challenges and stuff that
you brought to me and with 124

00:33:02.547-->00:33:07.552
of my colleagues was able to
organize a letter again to the
Obama administration to really

00:33:13.758-->00:33:18.763
ask them to change course on the
addition of these controls that
a- and now we're making sole

00:33:21.199-->00:33:26.338
progress on getting those
controls clarified. But it
wouldn't have happened without

00:33:26.338-->00:33:31.343
the engagement of the of the-a
of the technology community and
i just wanna underscore, uh,

00:33:34.346-->00:33:40.719
never underestimate the value
that you bring to the table in
advising policy makers about

00:33:40.719-->00:33:45.190
what's going to work and what's
not going to work or what we
need to do to change course

00:33:45.190-->00:33:51.930
to-to-to close vulnerabilities.
There are 435 members of
congress. The House. 100 members

00:33:51.930-->00:33:57.035
of the United States senate. We
all have varied interests we all
have things we per say

00:33:57.035-->00:34:01.973
specialize in. And you have a
small group of us, uh, myself,
and Will, Mike McCaul, uhm,

00:34:04.943-->00:34:09.948
Dutch Ruppersberger, uhm, you
have Mac Thornberry, and uh, a
couple others here that really

00:34:13.285-->00:34:19.391
get cyber and and we've made it
primary focus of what we do. And
then you've got the next level

00:34:19.391-->00:34:24.396
down of members who recognise
it's important but it's not
maybe persay their thing but

00:34:26.531-->00:34:30.702
they want to know more about it
and they wanna be up to speed on
it. And they got a few- they

00:34:30.702-->00:34:35.073
have a significant number that
it's not their thing- maybe it's
never going to be their thing,

00:34:35.073-->00:34:41.846
but they still need good advice
and people coming forward to
advise them and their staff. So

00:34:41.846-->00:34:48.286
I just wanted to close by saying
never underestimate the value
you can bring to the table, in

00:34:48.286-->00:34:52.724
helping to educate members and
staff about what the best
policies are and what's going to

00:34:52.724-->00:34:58.863
work and what's not going to
work and again, never assume
that we're-that we know all the

00:34:58.863-->00:35:03.868
thousands of bills that are
introduced in congress each year
it's not possible. So if you

00:35:03.868-->00:35:08.840
hear something or you become
aware of a bill or idea that you
think we need to know about, be

00:35:08.840-->00:35:13.845
proactive about it. And Engage.
And I just- in closing I just
ask you just rhetorically, you

00:35:17.215-->00:35:22.287
know, how many of you have ever
made an appointment with your
member of congress or their

00:35:22.287-->00:35:29.227
staff, or written an email, or
made a phone call? Ya know, I
would just ask you to be

00:35:29.227-->00:35:34.232
proactive because you can make
an impact and we want you to be
engaged. Thank you. [Crowd

00:35:41.306-->00:35:47.145
applause] >>An important point
in that story as well is the
process around this worked. The

00:35:47.145-->00:35:54.052
feedback that commerce was
getting instigated some
congressional hearings and one

00:35:54.052-->00:35:59.057
of your own, ended up going into
the negotiating room in-in
Europe to-to try to fix this

00:36:02.494-->00:36:09.100
multilateral agreement. And so I
think this is a-a-a great
example of how the right

00:36:09.100-->00:36:15.206
engagement of really smart
people fix a problem. Now, we're
not completely there yet,

00:36:15.206-->00:36:20.345
because we haven't signed the
new agreement, but I think we're
going to try and sort that out

00:36:20.345-->00:36:26.951
in-in December so it's an
example of how the wheels of the
process worked. >>Yeah, and

00:36:26.951-->00:36:31.056
Let's hear it for Katie Missouri
because she was the one the
really help- [applause and

00:36:31.056-->00:36:36.061
cheering from crowd] >>Thanks
Katie, Yeah >>Thank you Katie.
>>Katie Mo! >>So- So Katie, I

00:36:38.296-->00:36:43.668
want a picture when you walk in
with all these stuffy diplomats
and your pink hair. Yah know,

00:36:43.668-->00:36:48.673
and-and make sure you get that
picture next time. [faint
laughing] >>Alright, now that

00:36:51.009-->00:36:55.113
wasn't a- yah know Karen Ellis
already says that hackers are
the immune system of the

00:36:55.113-->00:37:00.885
internet right, we're the a- so
we flock to the dangerous threat
to the way we do our jobs and

00:37:00.885-->00:37:06.324
security in this particular case
but in some of these we want to
get in front of them uh, so our

00:37:06.324-->00:37:11.296
part we- it looks like the
Twitter poll was a pretty tight
race here, uhm, the winner was

00:37:11.296-->00:37:17.569
concerns of our a power
utilities infrastructures so in
the US and other countries these

00:37:17.569-->00:37:21.306
are designated critical
infrastructure that are very,
very important but are often

00:37:21.306-->00:37:27.545
privately owned and operated and
often quite exposed. Uhm, it's a
pretty close vote with also

00:37:27.545-->00:37:32.584
Marai's effect on taking out the
internet for a day. These low
cost, low hygiene devices,

00:37:32.584-->00:37:37.422
there's so many of them now with
the internet of everything. Uhm,
and then also the WannaCry type

00:37:37.422-->00:37:43.161
hospital outages where it's just
too easy for these things. We
tend to summarize these things

00:37:43.161-->00:37:48.566
at the Atlantic Counsel that our
over dependence on undependable
things is exposing us to

00:37:48.566-->00:37:53.238
accidents and adversaries. Uh,
that could be a National
security level event. Uh,

00:37:53.238-->00:37:58.610
instead of us flocking to maybe
go, you know, stop bad
wassenaar, what are the

00:37:58.610-->00:38:04.182
appropriate mechanisms or most
effective mechanisms for us to
proactively engage with members,

00:38:04.182-->00:38:08.520
with their staffs, with
committees? It's a bit of a
confusing and nebulous thing for

00:38:08.520-->00:38:13.291
us if you could give us some
succinct advice of where to get
started or whats worked to date

00:38:13.291-->00:38:19.097
for us bringing topics so we
don't wait for hospital outages?
>>Sure, I would go back to what

00:38:19.097-->00:38:24.102
I touched on just a few minutes
ago. Don't wait til something
comes to your attention to start

00:38:29.140-->00:38:33.378
engaging with your members of
congress and staff. Introduce
yourselves ahead of time, get to

00:38:33.378-->00:38:38.383
know them, let them get to know
you . And develop a rapport.
Develop a-open up a dialogue so

00:38:41.252-->00:38:47.625
that you know, you've already
established that rapport, that
trust if you will and so when

00:38:47.625-->00:38:54.365
something , you know, comes to
your attention that is serious
and needs to get their attention

00:38:54.365-->00:38:58.636
right away you already have a
point of contact. You don't have
to go searching for who that

00:38:58.636-->00:39:03.575
person is. >>On many of these
issues that you just went
through, there is a lack of a

00:39:07.045-->00:39:13.484
proper strategy on how to deal
with it. And so, let's start
with- let start with doing

00:39:13.484-->00:39:20.024
something to industrial controls
within the utility routes. So
what is it, 3 years ago, 2 years

00:39:20.024-->00:39:26.064
ago, this was no longer a
philosophical exercise. The
Russians did it in the Ukraine.

00:39:26.064-->00:39:31.069
If you look at the UN, the UN
says there's certain things that
are an act of war. It is foolin

00:39:34.005-->00:39:39.010
with somebody's grid. Is an Act
of war according to the UN. What
was the response to the Russians

00:39:43.548-->00:39:50.021
when they did that? Nothing. The
sanctions that were put in and
the sanctions that we just

00:39:50.021-->00:39:55.026
strengthened, uhm, in the House,
this week, was not because of
that. And So if you don't

00:39:59.564-->00:40:04.569
articulate what a response will
be to a certain redline, uhm,
that's a form of a deterrent.

00:40:07.839-->00:40:12.844
And so-so what should an actual
response be in-in that-in that
case and there's all kinds of

00:40:16.047-->00:40:22.854
conversations around it but
there is not an accepted policy
at the NSC that would ultimately

00:40:22.854-->00:40:29.127
drive this. Now, folks in
congress, we could be shining
light on this and talk through

00:40:29.127-->00:40:34.132
these issues. It's the Homeland
Security committee, which we're
on, it's the oversign government

00:40:36.935-->00:40:43.374
reform committee, where I chair
a sub committee there. It's
energy and commerce and it's

00:40:43.374-->00:40:50.181
also, uhm, science and
technology. Right, but Homeland
and OGR are 2 of the ones that

00:40:50.181-->00:40:56.654
do the bulk of some of this of
some of this work and so it's
important to educate us, the

00:40:56.654-->00:41:02.760
individual members of congress,
but we also need yall sitting
down with some of the staff that

00:41:02.760-->00:41:07.765
populate these committees.
Sitting down with GAO. GAO is-is
basically the inspector general

00:41:10.335-->00:41:15.606
of the entire government, and
then every department has IGs as
well, but these are the folks

00:41:15.606-->00:41:21.379
that are looking at kind of the
holes in policy, the holes in-in
taxes techniques and procedures

00:41:21.379-->00:41:27.852
when it come to defending a
digital infrastructure uhm,
so-so that we-we-we need to

00:41:27.852-->00:41:32.457
help-we need to be talking about
what's the strategies so then we
can start talking about the

00:41:32.457-->00:41:39.030
tactics and how we- how we
should be- who should be
responding to what. And this is

00:41:39.030-->00:41:44.702
another problem when it comes
with-comes along with
disinformation. The Russians are

00:41:44.702-->00:41:49.707
trying to erode trust in our
institutions. Period. End of
story. And how do we deal we do

00:41:54.379-->00:42:01.252
not have a counter covert
influence strategy. And many of
ya'll in this room can help and

00:42:01.252-->00:42:07.125
have delt and have operated in
some of these communities that
we could be leveraging

00:42:07.125-->00:42:12.330
intelligence from and talking
about so we don't have a
strategy there. So that's

00:42:12.330-->00:42:18.703
something that I'm concerned
with. Cause guess what we're
going to see this in 2018. And

00:42:18.703-->00:42:25.143
it's not just the Russians. We
know other nation states have
tried to do this and based on

00:42:25.143-->00:42:30.581
what was demonstrated in the
last 48 hours, we have to
tighten up some of these voting

00:42:30.581-->00:42:35.586
machines as well. So, all of
this stuff is connected and-and
nobody has the right answer but

00:42:38.189-->00:42:44.996
talking to folks that live and
breath this is important. And
so, committee staff's important,

00:42:44.996-->00:42:49.434
the legislative direc- wherever
y'all live, your member of
congress you should know the

00:42:49.434-->00:42:54.439
district director, uhm, you
should know the legislative
director for your member, those

00:42:54.439-->00:42:59.444
are 2 people that drive the
policies of those offices. >>And
who on their staff is the point

00:43:01.412-->00:43:06.417
person that deals with the
research community issues in
particularly. I just want to say

00:43:08.820-->00:43:14.125
something else if I could just
to underscore what Will had
said. What the Russians did was

00:43:14.125-->00:43:16.461
outrageous, it was wrong and
they are going to keep doing it.
Particularly if they're not hit

00:43:16.461-->00:43:21.466
hard enough, if they don't get
strong enough sanctions or the
message isn't sent clear enough

00:43:26.971-->00:43:31.008
that we're not going to tolerate
that kind of interference or
undermining our- our- of the

00:43:31.008-->00:43:36.614
pillars of our democracy. And we
have to look at this
holistically and say that as a

00:43:36.614-->00:43:43.488
nation state we have a whole
sweep of options that we can
draw from to-to retaliate to

00:43:43.488-->00:43:49.227
make the point that we're not
going to uh accept that kind of
interference with our elections

00:43:49.227-->00:43:56.200
and we need to make it very
clear from here forward.
>>Alright we're reaching the end

00:43:56.200-->00:44:03.074
here, um, boy I wish we had 3
hours for this. Um so, as we
face these challenges they're

00:44:03.074-->00:44:08.546
not going to slow down. I think
while we were here one of the
victims from Petya was Merck in

00:44:08.546-->00:44:12.617
the pharmaceutical industry
admitted that it had a material
impact on the production of

00:44:12.617-->00:44:17.889
several of their drugs. This is
designated critical
infrastructure. Unrestrained

00:44:17.889-->00:44:22.994
cyber ammunitions got outside
it's intended target and
affected US critical

00:44:22.994-->00:44:29.000
infrastructure. These are the
types of companies that make our
pandemic vaccines and shots

00:44:29.000-->00:44:34.372
incase we have a national
emergency. So, as I look across
this room I see a lot of raw

00:44:34.372-->00:44:39.377
talent. And I know in general we
loath to regulate, we loath to
work with government, we uh, in

00:44:41.646-->00:44:46.484
general like the come as you
are, do as you please type guys.
I know a lot of the things we

00:44:46.484-->00:44:51.989
see come on the news or around
the hill might have some rough
edges. As things get very, very

00:44:51.989-->00:44:58.162
real, and as the consequences of
failure get very, very high, I
really encourage you to see that

00:44:58.162-->00:45:03.234
they're outreaching a hand and
trying. And when they publish
something or they ask a question

00:45:03.234-->00:45:08.472
look for what's right in it and
cultivate that. We're really,
really good at finding what's

00:45:08.472-->00:45:12.777
wrong with something but I think
we're at that stage now where we
have to make that outstretched

00:45:12.777-->00:45:17.548
hand and go that extra mile and
meet in the middle if we're
going to rise to meet these

00:45:17.548-->00:45:24.355
challenges together. So I see
what we've done here maybe as a
coal or a little ember a little

00:45:24.355-->00:45:30.761
bit of heat and light. We can
either snuff it out or we can
foster it and grow it, uh, into

00:45:30.761-->00:45:35.766
a real vibrant collaboration
here. Uhm, we have now brought
D.C. to Def Con, I'm trying to

00:45:37.768-->00:45:42.607
make it happen so we can bring
more of Def Con to D.C. Perhaps
we can turn this into a regular

00:45:42.607-->00:45:47.612
thing. Maybe a Cyber caucus in
the Summer here? Maybe a cyber
caucus in D.C. around ShmooCon?

00:45:53.684-->00:45:58.689
Just sayin'. [light laughter and
applause] When we said 4 years
ago the cavalry isn't coming, it

00:46:01.225-->00:46:06.230
meant it fell to you. It was to
be depressed it falls to you.
So, if we see something missing

00:46:06.230-->00:46:11.202
in the world, we gotta put it
there. I hope this is the start.
I respect and admire every

00:46:11.202-->00:46:16.874
single person in this room. I
respect and admire our
colleagues in D.C. This has got

00:46:16.874-->00:46:22.813
to be the beginning. We've been
amazing for 25 years. Who are we
going to be for the next 25?

00:46:22.813-->00:46:27.818
Thank you. [Crowd Applause and
cheers]
