00:00:00.042-->00:00:05.042
>>So welcome this is the 25th
anniversary of Def Con I am the
Dark Tangent uh started this 25

00:00:07.167-->00:00:12.167
years ago and this is the
welcoming session so with that
welcome to Def Con 25

00:00:15.208-->00:00:20.208
[applause][cheering] Very good
so uh so with that said I have
now welcomed you, goodbye

00:00:29.708-->00:00:33.708
[laughs] Um I wanna just kinda I
want to see by a show of hands
how many people is this a first

00:00:33.708-->00:00:40.417
year kind of deal okay right on
so normally we do a session
that's like a normal session

00:00:40.417-->00:00:46.167
called uh Welcome to Def Con and
it's about 45 minutes and we
talk about history and we cover

00:00:46.167-->00:00:51.375
a lot of ground and I usually do
that with LostboY um and so we
have a couple different

00:00:51.375-->00:00:57.875
perspectives and but he couldn't
make it this year so it's just
me and so I'm gonna reduce my

00:00:57.875-->00:01:03.375
time and I'm down to 20 minutes,
I'm against Garry Kasparov um
which is kind of a hard hard guy

00:01:03.375-->00:01:08.333
to be against so I wanna just
kinda go a little bit over our
history kinda how we got here

00:01:08.333-->00:01:12.917
and where I think we're going um
and give you just a couple
pointers on how to get the most

00:01:12.917-->00:01:17.917
out of the Con, so I sort of act
as the conductor, the Con around
Def Con 3 got so large like I

00:01:21.458-->00:01:26.458
have no idea what's happening in
my own Con. Awesome stuff was
happening at Def Con 3 and I

00:01:26.458-->00:01:31.458
heard about it like on IRC a
week later and i felt- at first
I felt really bummed like I

00:01:33.500-->00:01:38.042
don't even know what's happening
in my own home you know like
maybe I shouldn't let it- maybe

00:01:38.042-->00:01:43.250
we shouldn't grow anymore I feel
like left out of my own thing
and then I realized no that's a

00:01:43.250-->00:01:47.625
good thing we need this thing to
be growing and things to be
happening and side stories and

00:01:47.625-->00:01:54.042
secret stories and secret
parties and uh and so then I
just embraced that it was gonna

00:01:54.042-->00:01:59.833
grow and I wasn't going to be
able to control it the best I
could be was sort of like a

00:01:59.833-->00:02:06.000
conductor trying to steer
traffic and from that first year
we had about 100 people and now

00:02:06.000-->00:02:11.000
I think this year we're at about
23-->000, 24-->000 and uh and it is
crazy like never in my wildest

00:02:15.583-->00:02:21.042
dreams I never thought we'd do a
second Def Con and it just- you
know it's got this gravity and

00:02:21.042-->00:02:26.500
this kind of inertia but it's
also got all this energy and
everyone of us that organize it

00:02:26.500-->00:02:31.500
ask a redshirt after Con we are
just exhausted, we are drained
and it's always like all these

00:02:33.542-->00:02:39.833
resignations come in at the end
like I quit this sucks and then
about a month later they're like

00:02:39.833-->00:02:44.917
I could do better next year you
know we could do this again and
that's like this emotional

00:02:44.917-->00:02:49.750
roller coaster we all go on and
so we all hide and then we start
planning on how to make it

00:02:49.750-->00:02:56.333
better um and so it's like this-
I don't see that stopping if
anything it just seems to be

00:02:56.333-->00:03:02.833
getting you know bigger and when
we started small it was all word
of mouth and remember there was

00:03:02.833-->00:03:07.833
no real internet and no Amazon
or Google you know not even Alta
Vista so [laughter] you couldn't

00:03:10.083-->00:03:16.250
find information on anything it
was all word of mouth or it was
like text files bulliten boards

00:03:16.250-->00:03:21.333
and in the early day you know
IRC so we didn't advertise it
just wasn't a culture of

00:03:21.333-->00:03:26.333
advertising and so we just cast
a really wide net, hackers,
phreakers, you know, privacy

00:03:29.125-->00:03:35.250
advocates, and uh and so we just
sort of invited everybody who
was interested in this tech and

00:03:35.250-->00:03:39.417
I think that's how we ended up
with such a broad section of
people attending I think that

00:03:39.417-->00:03:43.333
also turned out to be one of our
strengths I'd like to say by- it
was by design and I was a

00:03:43.333-->00:03:50.042
mastermind but it just sort of
happened to be the right move
and then also when we started

00:03:50.042-->00:03:53.667
there was some other
pre-existing hacking cons which
were great there was Summer Con

00:03:53.667-->00:03:58.667
it Atlanta, held in the Summer,
there was Ho Ho Con, held in the
winter, and then there was a

00:04:01.208-->00:04:08.042
Pump Con that was just starting,
held at Halloween, and so when I
started Def Con and they were

00:04:08.042-->00:04:12.958
invite only, when I started Def
Con it was like f**k this invite
only stuff like everybody's

00:04:12.958-->00:04:19.500
invited not realizing what road
that takes you down [laughter]
'cause once you make that

00:04:19.500-->00:04:25.333
decision that fork in the road
if you're not limiting
attendance you know, certain

00:04:25.333-->00:04:30.958
avenues are closed off to you,
but I thought that was the
better way to go, because in

00:04:30.958-->00:04:36.500
Vegas unlike New York or San
Francisco you actually have to
want to get here [laughs] I

00:04:36.500-->00:04:41.208
mean, you're in the middle of
the desert, there's no hacking
community in Las Vegas, so you

00:04:41.208-->00:04:46.917
had to care enough to get on an
airplane, fly to Las Vegas, and
that act is this natural like

00:04:46.917-->00:04:52.667
geographic filter, only those
who sort of cared enough came.
And maybe that's changed as

00:04:52.667-->00:04:56.792
we've grown up and we've gotten
more money but still to this day
you know y- if there's a little

00:04:56.792-->00:05:01.042
bit of commitment it's not like
just getting on a train to New
York and going downtown or you

00:05:01.042-->00:05:07.792
know in San Francisco hopping on
BART so there is a little bit of
effort involved and word of

00:05:07.792-->00:05:13.875
mouth I still don't advertise.
Um it's just if people want to
tell their friends that's the

00:05:13.875-->00:05:18.375
best advertising in the world
and really if I take a full page
ad out in the newspaper do I

00:05:18.375-->00:05:24.292
really want those people to show
up? [laughter] You know it just-
so um I'd like to say that was

00:05:24.292-->00:05:30.542
also a brilliant marketing move
but that's because really I had
no money and then the big

00:05:30.542-->00:05:35.042
turning point I think for us as
a culture- as a community was
the dot com the first dot com

00:05:35.042-->00:05:40.042
crash um and this was really for
me the inflection point we went
from we went from hackers with a

00:05:44.917-->00:05:50.417
passion this is our hobby this
is what we love to do and then
all of a sudden money came

00:05:50.417-->00:05:56.333
along, jobs came along, because
if you needed to secure your
shit online, who do you turn to?

00:05:56.333-->00:06:01.208
Well we were the only game in
town pretty much, so we all got
jobs. And I remember there was

00:06:01.208-->00:06:06.125
one Def Con where people were
talking about their incentive
stock options and what kind of-

00:06:06.125-->00:06:10.375
and it was like the conversation
just changed and really what
happened there is we had to go

00:06:10.375-->00:06:17.208
from being creatively
independently creative on our
own whim to being professionally

00:06:17.208-->00:06:23.208
creative, now it's your job, now
it's your career, you don't get
to tinker when you feel like it,

00:06:23.208-->00:06:28.708
you gotta get up in the morning
and do this professionally, and
that was a big change, and I

00:06:28.708-->00:06:32.208
think that was sort of what
happened during the
countercultural music revolution

00:06:32.208-->00:06:36.417
in say San Francisco you know
imagine that you're jammin' out
in the audience- I mean in a

00:06:36.417-->00:06:40.750
warehouse with an audience that
they just love you and then all
of a sudden these people fly in

00:06:40.750-->00:06:45.333
with jets with all this money
and they say Europe wants to
hear you, you know, east coast

00:06:45.333-->00:06:50.417
wants to hear you, you're a big
star, let's get your music out
and then musicians are like hell

00:06:50.417-->00:06:56.625
yeah I want to rock out London
and I want to do Paris, and next
thing you know, it changes

00:06:56.625-->00:07:01.417
right? You're not in the
warehouse in San Francisco,
you're all over the world. And

00:07:01.417-->00:07:06.208
we went through that I think
during the dot com revolution
and now we're in this sort of

00:07:06.208-->00:07:10.375
steady state, we've been around
for awhile, we've gotten through
our teething period, and now

00:07:10.375-->00:07:16.958
here we are, 25 years, silver
anniversary, and we've got a
community now that we've built

00:07:16.958-->00:07:21.958
by word of mouth, and by sort of
an inclusive atmosphere, and now
instead of people coming to us

00:07:24.458-->00:07:31.292
with a lot of money and jobs
trying to say we need your help
it's starting to be what we do

00:07:31.292-->00:07:36.292
really influences society like
we're actually becoming more
important policy people are

00:07:40.500-->00:07:46.458
listening to us companies want
our advice people are embedding
things in pacemakers and ATMs

00:07:46.458-->00:07:51.458
and automobiles and it's no
longer kind of ha ha ha it's we
collectively are the people that

00:07:54.167-->00:07:59.750
are going to be securing you
know the next 50 years of
technology for not- if not the

00:07:59.750-->00:08:06.208
country the world so in the back
of my mind it's like well it's
just a party and we're just a

00:08:06.208-->00:08:11.583
fun community and then the other
part of my brain is saying well
yeah but what we're doing

00:08:11.583-->00:08:18.292
actually has consequence and how
cool is that? We get to have fun
and be consequential who else

00:08:18.292-->00:08:22.458
gets to say that, right? We're
in a really unique period in
history where we're

00:08:22.458-->00:08:27.458
acknowledged, um, we don't- we
have full employment for life
unless we fix it [laughter]

00:08:31.208-->00:08:36.208
[applause] And everyday there's
a new challenge and so I just
want to say that you know we're

00:08:42.292-->00:08:48.375
going to be really close to
these levers of power, levers of
creating default permissions um

00:08:48.375-->00:08:52.125
are we going to be secure by
default, or insecure by default,
you know, we're going to be in

00:08:52.125-->00:08:58.833
that room when decisions are
made so just don't give yourself
less credit than is due like

00:08:58.833-->00:09:05.000
you're gonna be uh influential
and and hopefully through Def
Con you're gonna meet other

00:09:05.000-->00:09:10.000
people and we're gonna kind of
hopefully you learn that that um
that nobody no one person is

00:09:12.917-->00:09:17.250
gonna solve these problems, no
one person is gonna hack
everything, right? We've gotta-

00:09:17.250-->00:09:22.583
gotta make friends and it's
really a balance of social and
technical and in the early days

00:09:22.583-->00:09:29.542
I was all about the technical so
it's like better talks more
people and I really judged how

00:09:29.542-->00:09:33.375
the conference was going based
on how many people were in a
room, how many people showed up,

00:09:33.375-->00:09:38.375
what the killer talks were, and
as time went on I realized that-
and I was really worried that uh

00:09:40.417-->00:09:45.833
video conferencing was going to
kill kill the the conference
world and I realized, no, as

00:09:45.833-->00:09:50.375
video conferencing got better,
and bandwidth was increasing
more and more people were still

00:09:50.375-->00:09:54.750
coming to the conference because
it was that human interaction,
it was the social component that

00:09:54.750-->00:09:59.833
you couldn't you know transmit
that's what people were
responding to it actually was

00:09:59.833-->00:10:04.708
that the talks were the
secondary thing and the social
was the primary thing so we

00:10:04.708-->00:10:09.708
really try to balance out the
two when- and by doing that as I
said it's conference is too big

00:10:12.125-->00:10:17.583
we can't track it all so instead
I kind of turned into like a
landlord and my strategy was

00:10:17.583-->00:10:22.125
I'll give you enough rope to
hang yourself with your contest
or your event you get one free

00:10:22.125-->00:10:27.833
try if you convince us you've
got an idea and if people
respond to it you can try again

00:10:27.833-->00:10:33.000
but if you really screw up we're
taking your space away and we're
giving it to someone else and

00:10:33.000-->00:10:36.917
then it really became about
seeing what the community comes
up with seeing what you guys are

00:10:36.917-->00:10:40.875
doing and we've gotten- you know
it started with the Hardware
Hacking Village and the Lock

00:10:40.875-->00:10:45.875
Pick Village now we have a Car
Hacking Village where they're
giving away a vehicle,

00:10:45.875-->00:10:50.875
Biohacking where they're trying
to go to a Vet and inject
themselves with things

00:10:54.292-->00:10:58.750
[laughter] you know we have a uh
I'm wearing this shirt the our
democracy has been hacked from

00:10:58.750-->00:11:05.125
uh the Mr. Robot shirt from the
Voting Machine Village Hacking
uh contests we're doing and this

00:11:05.125-->00:11:09.583
track we're doing this year,
well that didn't exist until it
was an idea of like four months

00:11:09.583-->00:11:14.583
ago. So we're gonna be a
platform for hacking anything we
can get our hands on and we

00:11:16.708-->00:11:20.667
don't have to hack it right and
we don't have to hack it
perfect, let's just hack on it,

00:11:20.667-->00:11:26.875
and figure it out and- and pass
on what we learn and so when
you're walking around, remember

00:11:26.875-->00:11:31.250
you're gonna get a lot out of
this conference by just even
just the social aspects and so I

00:11:31.250-->00:11:35.458
don't feel hurt anymore when
people say oh I'm not gonna go
to any talks, Hallway Con is

00:11:35.458-->00:11:40.458
where it's at. I'm like that's
cool Line Con, Bar Con, Pool
Con, I don't care [laughter]

00:11:43.042-->00:11:48.042
it's just important that you
know, that that we are here
meeting our peers and having a

00:11:52.083-->00:11:58.958
beer, right? So um some of the
things we do every year uh is
I'm a big believer in sharing

00:11:58.958-->00:12:05.375
the knowledge and so that's also
because I grew up kind of as a
software pilot so I try to carry

00:12:05.375-->00:12:11.000
that forward so we release all
of our talks, all of our
materials, everything's for free

00:12:11.000-->00:12:16.000
in case you didn't know, we- um
takes a couple months, we did
this um uh English captioning um

00:12:18.917-->00:12:23.917
one year um somebody that was um
hearing impaired wanted to come
and because the ADA you're

00:12:26.208-->00:12:30.750
required by law to do that but
it also seems like a really good
thing to do, just make it more

00:12:30.750-->00:12:36.250
accessible and uh and so we
hired a sign language
interpreter and uh and the

00:12:36.250-->00:12:41.792
person didn't show up so I've
got the sign la- and you can't
hire just one sign language

00:12:41.792-->00:12:45.667
interpreter, you need two
because they have to take a rest
uh in between they get burned

00:12:45.667-->00:12:52.000
out so then I thought okay why
don't I just caption it for
everybody and then people can

00:12:52.000-->00:12:55.917
run this through translators and
maybe they can translate it into
different languages and now all

00:12:55.917-->00:13:01.875
of a sudden I can share these
talks to everybody because now
there's this metadata um and

00:13:01.875-->00:13:06.750
then it turns out California
passes a law saying that you
can't use any talks or materials

00:13:06.750-->00:13:11.750
in the universities unless
there's uh a second audio
program or a transcription so as

00:13:14.667-->00:13:18.792
more and more states go that way
what do you know our talks are
going to be able to be used as

00:13:18.792-->00:13:23.917
in uh universities and so I'll
always try to do things and
spend money to try to make talks

00:13:23.917-->00:13:27.417
more accessible so for example
this year all the villages that
are having talks, we're

00:13:27.417-->00:13:33.833
recording, because, you know,
you could argue, well you don't
have to come to Def Con we're

00:13:33.833-->00:13:39.792
streaming two tracks uh we're
going to give everything away
why show up? Like I'm fine with

00:13:39.792-->00:13:45.750
that, I'm just trying to get the
information out there because I
want us, I just want more of us

00:13:45.750-->00:13:50.750
[laughter] um so with that said
I want you to you know enjoy,
we've got live music tonight, uh

00:13:53.125-->00:13:57.583
silver anniversary, we've got
some secrets, we've got some
challenges, um and I'm just

00:13:57.583-->00:14:02.583
really proud of how far we've
come and uh and I just want to
welcome you all and if you have

00:14:02.583-->00:14:08.500
any questions ask anybody in a
red shirt give us feedback
because we live on feedback,

00:14:08.500-->00:14:13.875
feedback at Def Con dot org um
and then afterwards a lot of
times people go to for- the

00:14:13.875-->00:14:18.625
forums, forum dot Def Con dot
org and we do this sort of after
action report where everybody

00:14:18.625-->00:14:23.792
b**ches about what went wrong
and then how we can make it
better and we actually have

00:14:23.792-->00:14:28.458
giant lists of everything that
