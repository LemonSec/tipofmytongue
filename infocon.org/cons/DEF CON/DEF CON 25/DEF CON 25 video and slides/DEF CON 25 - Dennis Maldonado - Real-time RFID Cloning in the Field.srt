00:00:00.133-->00:00:06.340
>>So who here is for the RFID
talk? Eh Every- everyone. Uh
so it's gonna be uh, uh it's

00:00:06.340-->00:00:11.278
gonna be a quick 20-minute talk,
uh it's something I've been
working on for a while, uh it's

00:00:11.278-->00:00:16.383
i- i- it's not 100 percent
complete yet so there, you'll.
you'll see a lot of like uh, uh

00:00:16.383-->00:00:19.419
kind of missing things or
something where I'll say hey
this is not perfect but I'm

00:00:19.419-->00:00:25.425
working on it, uh but yeah so
real time RFID cloning in the
field. This is not something new

00:00:25.425-->00:00:31.531
but it's just, I it's, it's a
different way of doing things uh
and you'll see me fiddling with

00:00:31.531-->00:00:34.735
this thing the whole time
because I'm trying to get it to
work before the demo slide comes

00:00:34.735-->00:00:40.741
on so one second, let me turn
this one on. They sound really
cool when they start up.

00:00:40.741-->00:00:45.746
[inaudible] [laughter] I always
get weird looks from people like
I'm, I'm about to die.

00:00:48.415-->00:00:53.287
[laughter] Alright, so that may
not be me stealing someone's
badge. Uh, so who am I? I'm not

00:00:53.287-->00:00:57.124
going to spend too much time.
I'm Dennis a lot of you know me,
uh who here's been to one of my

00:00:57.124-->00:01:03.530
other talks before? I spoke
twice, everyone? Uh, I'm an
adversarial engineer at LARES

00:01:03.530-->00:01:08.535
Consulting. Uh, uh and for I- I
am a Houstonian a current
Houstonian uh and I found, woo,

00:01:10.704-->00:01:15.042
I founded Houston Lock Sport a
lock picking club. We just hand
out, drink beers and pick locks

00:01:15.042-->00:01:19.813
uh and ha ha, Houston Area
Hackers Anonymous or association
or whatever you want to call it

00:01:19.813-->00:01:23.717
uh, for those who are, wh- who,
if you're in Houston, you find
yourself in Houston around the

00:01:23.717-->00:01:28.922
same time we do any of those
meet ups totally stop by, it's
awesome. Uh, I spoke previously

00:01:28.922-->00:01:33.927
at Def Con 23 and Def Con 24. Uh
okay. So, yeah demos totally not
gonna work but. RFID, radio

00:01:37.731-->00:01:43.737
frequency identification so, wh-
you all know what RFID is right?
Why her has an RFID card on

00:01:43.737-->00:01:49.343
them? Don't lie. All of you
guys. I mean who here is staying
at this hotel? Alright, RFID

00:01:49.343-->00:01:55.682
cards. So just a little bit
background what radio frequency
identification is. Uh, it's

00:01:55.682-->00:01:59.586
electronic access control for
many companies, and
organizations, hotels and what

00:01:59.586-->00:02:03.357
have you. Even some homes,
personal homes have it if you
have like uh one of those

00:02:03.357-->00:02:07.828
Samsung smart locks that
supports RFID technology. It's a
contact list form of

00:02:07.828-->00:02:14.067
authentication. So, you have a
wireless badge, uh kind of like
what I have in my hand here. Uh

00:02:14.067-->00:02:19.272
it's either a tag or a badge th-
they come in many different form
factors uh and you present it to

00:02:19.272-->00:02:24.277
a reader on the wall or on a
door and if it's the correct,
correct card it lets you in. Uh

00:02:27.114-->00:02:31.051
as far as hard technology wise
there's 2 different types of
technology that's going to

00:02:31.051-->00:02:34.788
require 2 different types of
readers. You have the low
frequency technology that runs

00:02:34.788-->00:02:41.428
on 125 kilohertz uh and that's
typically your HID Prox, Indala,
flex, ioProx and some other uh,

00:02:41.428-->00:02:46.166
uh manufactured inventors that
make that type of technology.
It's older technology, it's

00:02:46.166-->00:02:50.737
commonly referred to as less
secure because it doesn't
support uh, cool things like

00:02:50.737-->00:02:55.942
cryptography and stuff. Uh but
then you have high frequency
which operates on a 13.56

00:02:55.942-->00:03:01.681
megahertz and that's where y-
HID iCLASS comes in, MIFARE,
LEGIC and others that you've

00:03:01.681-->00:03:06.620
heard of. Uh, this is the
technology that actually
supports cryptography and uh,

00:03:06.620-->00:03:10.957
mathematics and a lot of other
things between the card and
reader to make it harder to

00:03:10.957-->00:03:16.897
clone a card and attack the
reader. Um, you b-, you'll hear
commonly referred to as

00:03:16.897-->00:03:22.836
credentials, uh card stickers,
tags, you guys have all
different sorts of, of media

00:03:22.836-->00:03:27.707
that have this technology
imbedded in them. And, and a lot
of devices may have an RFID tag

00:03:27.707-->00:03:32.212
in it and you may not even know
it. Uh if you've ever gotten
like uh, a garage remote or

00:03:32.212-->00:03:38.318
smart key from an apartment,
there might be an a- uh, uh an
RFID tag in there for the key

00:03:38.318-->00:03:43.023
management computer or
something. Um, so here's just
some examples, you see e- e-

00:03:43.023-->00:03:49.663
employee badges uh, ISIS back
when it was called ISIS now what
is it called?? The uh, uh

00:03:49.663-->00:03:55.469
Figgis, the Cyril Figgis
detective thing, something like
that, whatever. Uh but you have

00:03:55.469-->00:03:59.439
these badges that people will
wear on their person at all
times even when they're not at

00:03:59.439-->00:04:04.277
work. You have people wearing it
on their uh uh lanyard on over
the neck and it's swinging

00:04:04.277-->00:04:09.116
around or they have it on their
either left side or right side
just pinned to their belt. And,

00:04:09.116-->00:04:14.821
and what that allows us to do
as, as pen testers, I'm gonna
assume everyone here is legit,

00:04:14.821-->00:04:19.626
they're pen testers, they're not
like Black Hat hackers. But as
pen testers if we're targeting a

00:04:19.626-->00:04:25.065
specific company we want to get
in physically then we can see
how they're' wearing their

00:04:25.065-->00:04:30.103
badges and target that. So, if
we have a device like a, one of
these long-range readers I'm

00:04:30.103-->00:04:35.742
going to talk about and we see
they're wearing their badge on
their left side hip then we can

00:04:35.742-->00:04:40.413
put our RFID reader in a
backpack and walk by someone
passing by their left side and

00:04:40.413-->00:04:46.153
try to get a good badge read
from that. So, here's kind of
ooo, there ya go, here's kind of

00:04:46.153-->00:04:51.625
th- sneaky little, random person
I don't know, uh who's sitting,
who knows this guy has a badge

00:04:51.625-->00:04:56.696
so I sit next to it and in my
backpack is one of the RFID
readers and I'm just close

00:04:56.696-->00:05:01.968
enough to get a quick read and
I'm acting nonchalant, I'm
trying not to be suspicious

00:05:01.968-->00:05:06.873
other than the fact that I look
like me. Uh and just walk away.
And now I have that person's

00:05:06.873-->00:05:13.280
badge. So, what did I sue?? I
used one of these long-range
readers. So, there's a few

00:05:13.280-->00:05:17.450
different types of long range
readers that you've, that you
guys have probably seen. Uh like

00:05:17.450-->00:05:22.522
I said this is nothing new.
Bishop Fox the, c- came like
did, did a talk like this what

00:05:22.522-->00:05:26.726
2, 3 years ago? Where they
talked about weaponized one of
these long-range readers. So,

00:05:26.726-->00:05:31.731
you have the MaxiProx 5375 and
that's the low frequency long
range reader that HID uh

00:05:35.168-->00:05:39.906
manufactured and sold at some
point. Uh and it can read HID
Prox card and it can actually

00:05:39.906-->00:05:46.112
read it from a range of 18 to 24
inches. That's, that's somewhere
between like, 2 to 3 feet. Uh

00:05:46.112-->00:05:49.916
it's actually pretty good. Uh
it's a good read range. So, you
don't actually have to like get

00:05:49.916-->00:05:56.356
up to someone and touch their
butt to get a card read.
[laughter] Damn, who said that?

00:05:56.356-->00:06:01.294
Uh y- but you'd you just have to
be close enough, like that
bench. I was a few feet away

00:06:01.294-->00:06:06.299
from that person at the bench uh
or maybe in an elevator. So,
here's, here's, here's what it

00:06:08.401-->00:06:13.406
looks like. Like, except I took
it apart. Um, it's got a big
antenna coil that's energized

00:06:17.110-->00:06:22.115
and will constantly send out up
power, eh- like, just w- I- I'm
not a physics major but radio

00:06:24.851-->00:06:31.091
frequencies. I'm not even going
to try and fake it. Th a- a- and
a card is present within the

00:06:31.091-->00:06:34.728
field close enough it'll power
the card and that card will
respond back with i- it's

00:06:34.728-->00:06:39.566
information and we get a read.
Uh same thing with the R90 those
are for the high frequency

00:06:39.566-->00:06:45.672
cards, I class cards. Uh, an-
and those uh th- because of the,
the, the, the technology and the

00:06:45.672-->00:06:52.078
physics and the science uh it
doesn't read as long of a r- of
a range as the low frequency so

00:06:52.078-->00:06:57.050
it's kind of 12 to 16 inches but
it's still good enough for what
we want to do. And that's this

00:06:57.050-->00:07:01.988
one here. That's the cover and
that's what it looks like. Um,
this thing. And these are

00:07:06.493-->00:07:10.797
devices, these aren't like
hacker devices these are
devices, uh oh by the way

00:07:10.797-->00:07:13.967
they're small enough to fit in a
backpack and you can find them
on eBay, be it they're probably

00:07:13.967-->00:07:19.205
expensive but you can find them
on eBay. Uh these devices aren't
hacker devices they are devices

00:07:19.205-->00:07:26.179
that manufacture or like
building owners uh, e- anyone
who has a facility can buy or

00:07:26.179-->00:07:31.785
vendor can buy to allow
legitimate users to scan their
badge from a distance for

00:07:31.785-->00:07:36.389
example if they're in a car you
don't' want the user to have to
get out and go to the reader and

00:07:36.389-->00:07:40.093
scan their badge but if they can
do it from their car, the long
range readers going to provide

00:07:40.093-->00:07:44.964
enough of a read range to do
that. Um, and so you see them
all over the place if you pay

00:07:44.964-->00:07:50.470
attention. Go to like garages or
some apartments that have those.
Or, or or like parking lots for

00:07:50.470-->00:07:54.174
companies, they'll have those
long-range readers. No don't go
stealing those because they're

00:07:54.174-->00:08:00.880
connected somewhere so you'll
create a lot of damage. Uh but
often like maybe a building gets

00:08:00.880-->00:08:05.452
decommissioned or demolished and
they take these and they sell
them or they donate them to some

00:08:05.452-->00:08:10.457
uh, warehouse, electronics part
warehouse so you can go look for
them. So, what uh one of these

00:08:12.592-->00:08:17.097
look like? So, this is what one
kind of looks like normally. Uh
you see it's got that big

00:08:17.097-->00:08:21.434
antenna coil and all that
circuitry hidden behind that
white piece of paper that's the

00:08:21.434-->00:08:26.773
normal circuitry that it comes
with uh to kind of paper that
coil and do all of its magic

00:08:26.773-->00:08:32.579
mumbo jumbo to make RFID reading
work and then there's just,
often there's 4 wires, sometimes

00:08:32.579-->00:08:36.750
there's more but the minimum is
4. You've got 2 wires for power
and ground and you've got 2

00:08:36.750-->00:08:41.554
wires for the Wiegand data 1 and
the Wiegand data zero. Uh and
those will often feed all the

00:08:41.554-->00:08:45.859
way back to some wall through,
through some wall to some
controller that interprets that

00:08:45.859-->00:08:51.664
information. So, what we can do
is if we were to grab one of
these, we can modify it so you

00:08:51.664-->00:08:57.036
can see here on this picture I
put extra circuitry in here. Uh
the first one on the bottom

00:08:57.036-->00:09:01.908
being a battery source. Uh, in
this case I'm using uh 18 650
batteries. I'll kind of go into

00:09:01.908-->00:09:06.713
detail a little later. Uh but
that battery source is going to
allow me to power this reader uh

00:09:06.713-->00:09:12.218
on its' own and not be connected
to an external source. Uh and
then there's a series of DC

00:09:12.218-->00:09:17.090
boost converters and 09:13
converters. Sounds advanced but
it really isn't. Uh, but just to

00:09:17.090-->00:09:21.728
kind of do power management like
uh boost the, the voltage up to
12 volts to power the reader

00:09:21.728-->00:09:25.532
then back down to 5 volts to
power Raspberry Pi. And then we
have the Raspberry Pi which is

00:09:25.532-->00:09:31.371
the brains of this operation
here. Um, wh- what the Raspberry
Pi does is, is it allows for

00:09:31.371-->00:09:36.543
wireless connectivity so I, I
can spin up a Wi-Fi access
point. By the way that's the new

00:09:36.543-->00:09:41.681
Raspberry Pi Zero W it's
awesome. It's 10 bucks and it
has wireless built in. Um, and I

00:09:41.681-->00:09:45.885
can I can host servers. It's a
Linux operating system so I can
host web pages and servers and

00:09:45.885-->00:09:50.924
stuff. Uh and, what, what this
Raspberry Pi will do is, it'll
it's connected to the Wiegand

00:09:50.924-->00:09:55.528
data wires of this reader and
it'll interpret and
automatically decode with python

00:09:55.528-->00:10:00.934
code that is- has been released
to, like 10 minutes ago, um, uh
you- I'll, I'll talk about it.

00:10:00.934-->00:10:07.407
Uh, it's terrible code, don't
pl- [applause] While you're
clapping I'm gonna see if my

00:10:07.407-->00:10:13.146
demo's gonna work. Uh probably
not. Turn off your Wi-Fi devices
please. And whoever's trying to

00:10:13.146-->00:10:17.517
crack that network, stop. Um
[laughter] so it's gonna
automatically decode, uh

00:10:17.517-->00:10:24.123
interrupt and decode the Wiegand
uh the, the, eh data and it's
going to uh get present, ooo it

00:10:24.123-->00:10:28.495
worked, present all the infor-
information for, well hol- don't
clap yet because I haven't

00:10:28.495-->00:10:33.166
started the demo yet. So, I'm
going to speed through it to get
to the demo. Um, so it's, so the

00:10:33.166-->00:10:36.936
Raspberry Pi is the brains of
the operation it does
everything. So, m- let's, let's

00:10:36.936-->00:10:41.941
see if this is gonna work for
me. So, I am connected to
something. Oh, yes. Boop. Let's

00:10:46.513-->00:10:51.518
see, let's see. Open. Okay, so
what, what I have here now is I
had to use my backup reader uh

00:10:54.687-->00:10:59.292
but this is the high frequency
reader and what it's, wh- wh-
it, it's currently powered on

00:10:59.292-->00:11:03.296
powered by these batteries and
there's a Raspberry Pi, th- i-
it's connected to. The Raspberry

00:11:03.296-->00:11:08.134
Pi has Wi-fi enabled. So, it has
an access point and I'm
connected to that access point.

00:11:08.134-->00:11:13.506
Um, I'm just going to go ahead
and get a read now, just in
case. That work? Ah! E-

00:11:13.506-->00:11:18.511
something broke. Uh, so what
happen- what's happening is
every time it gets a read it's

00:11:20.680-->00:11:24.651
gonna automa- eh there's a
webpage that you connect to, so
you connect to this over Wi-Fi

00:11:24.651-->00:11:29.656
via your phone or your uh, uh,
uh laptop and you go to this
webpage and it's just

00:11:32.225-->00:11:37.797
websockets, what it has is it
has a table with all the Wiegand
information in it and uh that's

00:11:37.797-->00:11:42.702
gonna be your Wiegand binary,
your Wiegand hex data and your
card number facility code. Right

00:11:42.702-->00:11:47.707
now, this is a unknown card so
let me get a quick legitimate
card and see what happens. And

00:11:53.246-->00:11:56.549
what's cool about this is for
those who remember or who
remember even made the Bishop

00:11:56.549-->00:12:01.654
Fox one u the Bishop Fox one is
great and i- it gave me the kind
of incentive to, to make it

00:12:01.654-->00:12:06.292
better because with, with the
Bishop Fox one when you get a
card read you have to go back to

00:12:06.292-->00:12:11.197
your base wherever, take the
take the SD card out, decode the
Wiegand binary data as you see

00:12:11.197-->00:12:16.202
there and uh, uh just, ya know
figure out how to decode that an
uh and go from there. Uh but

00:12:19.038-->00:12:24.978
what mine does is if you see in
the, boom, reads here, I'm
actually not going to read this

00:12:24.978-->00:12:30.550
because it's probably not a
number I should be displaying uh
but [laughter] if you see this

00:12:30.550-->00:12:33.886
over here you see this is the
Wiegand data string, this is
the, the Wiegand binary you'll

00:12:33.886-->00:12:37.757
typically get with the Bishop
Fox uh from the SD card. Uh what
it'll do is it'll give you the

00:12:37.757-->00:12:40.660
hex data and this is cool
because you don't have to do
anything. You don't' have to

00:12:40.660-->00:12:45.865
automatically decode that, uh by
hand. It'll actually give you
this and this is what you need

00:12:45.865-->00:12:49.736
for the Proxmark. All you do is
you pass this code to the
Proxmark and boom, you've cloned

00:12:49.736-->00:12:55.174
a card. Uh and then it'll even,
uh decode this num- these
numbers for you 18 2 2 1 that's

00:12:55.174-->00:12:59.379
the facility vote, that's the
card number. Uh and incase it's
a specific format it's a card,

00:12:59.379-->00:13:03.816
eh this is the card number
without the facility code. So,
this will automatically decode

00:13:03.816-->00:13:07.253
based on the specific format.
For those who are familiar with
HID there's a specific format

00:13:07.253-->00:13:12.525
like 26 bit, 35 bit, 37 bit.
This'll do all that magic for
you all you gotta do is get a

00:13:12.525-->00:13:19.165
card read and then copy and
paste this into uh, Proxmark.
Super easy. Uh what I also have

00:13:19.165-->00:13:24.170
if this didn't die on me, aha.
Uh, boom. Let's see. There we
go. Oops. Oh. Aw. That's not my

00:13:35.782-->00:13:40.787
dog, that's [laughter] that's
Doug's dog. He's Doug, from
Austin. Her name is River, she's

00:13:43.656-->00:13:50.163
cute. Um, so let's say I have
this thing in my backpack
there's a bag here, and I- I'm

00:13:50.163-->00:13:54.434
in the elevator and I wanna get
someone's read. I don't but I
don't know if I'm positioned

00:13:54.434-->00:13:59.305
right. So, what you do is, this
is an android app, it's on my
phone, uh and what I'll do is, I

00:13:59.305-->00:14:04.944
will get close enough to the
person to get a read. You can
still see it. And let's, where's

00:14:04.944-->00:14:09.949
my card? Is this the good card
or the bad card? So, you get a
read and what happens is it

00:14:15.021-->00:14:20.426
automatically pops up on that
screen and as you heard you get
a notification. So even when

00:14:20.426-->00:14:27.366
you're not focused on it, I get
a notification. Of course, don't
let it sound, let it vibrate. Uh

00:14:27.366-->00:14:32.371
but, but now, but now you have,
you have in your pocket, it's
vibrating and yes, I got a good

00:14:34.474-->00:14:38.111
read. And by the way, I've got a
Pebble watch and I got it on my
Pebble watch too so I can see

00:14:38.111-->00:14:43.616
facility code and card number on
there. So, I know exactly who I
just got uh, and, and that's,

00:14:43.616-->00:14:47.687
that's pretty much th- there's
an android app, the android app
we're still kind of working on.

00:14:47.687-->00:14:51.858
I haven't had time to finish it
but that'll be released really
soon once I get that finished.

00:14:51.858-->00:14:56.129
Now that's pretty much the meat
of it. Now there is another cool
thing unfortunately, let me try

00:14:56.129-->00:15:01.067
and get it. Um, turn that off.
Turn this on. One cool thing I
really want to show you guys but

00:15:03.703-->00:15:07.740
I don't think I'll be able to
because WI-FI is not working is
with the low frequency reader

00:15:07.740-->00:15:12.779
and I'm slowly working on the
high frequency reader, I have
this. This is currently very

00:15:12.779-->00:15:18.351
big, there's a Raspberry Pi in
there, uh, uh, uh p- Proxmark in
there and a battery. What this

00:15:18.351-->00:15:23.089
will do is, it's the satellite
system. It's wh- when you turn
this on which I'm gonna turn it

00:15:23.089-->00:15:28.528
on right now, it's a, it's a
battery-powered. Ooo, I have 5
minutes, thank you. It's a

00:15:28.528-->00:15:33.566
battery powered Raspberry Pi,
this wirelessly connects to this
access point from that reader.

00:15:33.566-->00:15:38.871
So, let's say Tim and I are in
an assessment and Tim has the
RFID reader and I have this

00:15:38.871-->00:15:43.776
satellite kind of at least, what
30 feet a- away from him. When
he gets a read it's going to

00:15:43.776-->00:15:48.748
automatically send that
information to this satellite
system, satellite Pi and it's

00:15:48.748-->00:15:53.653
going to automatically write a
card. So, all you do is just
take it out and you have a copy.

00:15:53.653-->00:15:58.324
So I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm
gonna try for like 1 second to
see if this is gonna work. Let's

00:15:58.324-->00:16:03.262
find out. Did it get a read?
Yeah, there's too much wireless
here so unfortunately I can't

00:16:12.138-->00:16:17.376
demo it, but what I can do is I
will m- if someo- if someone
wants to offer a village I can

00:16:17.376-->00:16:21.080
hang out with tomorrow I can
have all this stuff up and you
guys can all play with it. Uh

00:16:21.080-->00:16:24.851
but, hit me up on Twitter
tomorrow, I'll have all the
stuff and I'll bring it

00:16:24.851-->00:16:29.856
somewhere. Probably to Lock Pick
Village and I'll just let you
guys see how all this works. But

00:16:29.856-->00:16:33.392
yeah. What this will
automatically do is it will
automatically clone that card

00:16:33.392-->00:16:38.397
and, so in seconds you s-, you
steal someone's badge and you
have a complete copy and you

00:16:44.003-->00:16:49.008
just walk into the building.
That's pretty much it for that.
[applause] So, I'm gonna, I'm

00:16:53.412-->00:16:57.617
gonna rush through making your
own. I don't have a lot of
detail here is because the

00:16:57.617-->00:17:02.188
reason of that I'm posting most
of the detail on GitHub. I
written quite a bit of detail on

00:17:02.188-->00:17:07.360
there. Once Tim, Tim right there
Tim McGuffin, once he helps me
figure out how to draw schematic

00:17:07.360-->00:17:11.230
diagram I'll draw a schematic
diagram on how you can make one
of these your own. But it's

00:17:11.230-->00:17:15.768
fairly simple. So, making your
own, all you need it, you need
of course you need one of these

00:17:15.768-->00:17:19.305
readers. Buy it on eBay or
whatever. If you pay me enough
money I can give you that one.

00:17:19.305-->00:17:24.877
Uh but it's, a lot of money. You
need a battery source, battery
can be anything, uh it has to

00:17:24.877-->00:17:28.848
support 3 amps so if you just
use like a few double A's
probably not going to work but a

00:17:28.848-->00:17:32.685
bunch of double A's will work,
just like Bishop Foxes. But I
like to use the 18 650

00:17:32.685-->00:17:35.888
batteries. My batteries support
10 amps each. They're awesome
and they have a protection

00:17:35.888-->00:17:40.526
circuit so when you screw
something up and I've screwed
something up, uh the protection

00:17:40.526-->00:17:44.497
circuit will hopefully prevent
your reader from dying. And
that's another story for later.

00:17:44.497-->00:17:49.502
Uh, then all you need i- I got a
read. Who, who read my card? Um,
then you need a DC boost

00:17:52.805-->00:17:55.808
converter, so if you have a
battery service like, these 2
batteries here only support 7

00:17:55.808-->00:18:00.046
volts. The boost converter will
boost it up to 12 volts. So it
can actually power the reader.

00:18:00.046-->00:18:03.249
But then you need a buck
converter so you don't burn your
Raspberry Pi. That's gonna,

00:18:03.249-->00:18:07.620
that's gonna bring the 12 volts
down to 5 volts to power the Pi.
And of course you get the Pi

00:18:07.620-->00:18:13.626
Zero with all the magic and of
course wire. So, to, with the Pi
Zero, just install Raspbian

00:18:13.626-->00:18:17.797
Jessie Lite. I see everyone
taking pictures so I'm going to
upload this the GitHub after

00:18:17.797-->00:18:22.435
this. Uh, but there's a, there's
a GitHub, yeah take a picture of
that fine. Uh there's the GitHub

00:18:22.435-->00:18:26.138
link. Uh, download Raspbian
Jessi- Jessie Lite and install
it on an SD card, put it on the

00:18:26.138-->00:18:31.677
Raspberry Pi and there's Python
code and uh, and a setup script.
All you do is you run the setup

00:18:31.677-->00:18:35.581
script after you install
Raspbian Jessie Lite and that
should install everything for

00:18:35.581-->00:18:40.987
you. It should install and setup
a WIFI access point and install
the python code necessary to a,

00:18:40.987-->00:18:46.525
to get all this to work. And
then on the Github I'll f- I'll
t- I'll show you how to wire the

00:18:46.525-->00:18:53.032
geo pins to get that to go. It's
5 simple pins, power, ground, d-
data 1, data zero, 4 pins not 5.

00:18:53.032-->00:18:57.737
Um, and then for the automatic
cloning, none of that's gonna be
on GitHub yet, because I'm still

00:18:57.737-->00:19:02.642
working on it. But it's simple.
It's just a, a Proxmark, any
version with the Raspberry Pi

00:19:02.642-->00:19:07.646
and a battery. That's all it is.
So, if you go to my GitHub which
I've just made this public. How

00:19:09.815-->00:19:14.820
do I switch tabs? I can't see my
mouse. There it is. Here you'll
see there is a set of scripts

00:19:17.890-->00:19:21.694
down here so once you get
Raspbian Jessie Lite on a
Raspberry Pi just run that set

00:19:21.694-->00:19:25.364
of scripts. It should do
everything automatically. Uh
I'l-, I'm gonna be working on

00:19:25.364-->00:19:30.569
getting a, eh, a Raspberry Pi, a
Raspbian image that has all this
stuff. I already have that image

00:19:30.569-->00:19:35.641
but it's a 16 gig uh DD of a SD
card. I have to figure out how
to make it a 2 giga SD card

00:19:35.641-->00:19:39.812
without actually having, unless
somebody has a 2 gig SD card
they can lend me? No? Okay, uh

00:19:39.812-->00:19:46.585
but down here there's a bunch of
information on how to set it up.
And as the day, as the weeks, as

00:19:46.585-->00:19:51.390
time goes by I'm gonna be
updating it, making it more
clear and adding more diagrams

00:19:51.390-->00:19:55.828
to get it to, to work. Uh it's,
it's been pretty busy last few
months so I haven't had a lot of

00:19:55.828-->00:20:00.833
time but I'm going to focus on
that, so. Um, that's pretty much
it, I'm out of time so,

00:20:10.676-->00:20:15.681
questions. Questions. [applause]
Uh, I guess I'm out of time so
I'm gonna have to like step down

00:20:19.251-->00:20:23.189
here while I, and, and I can
ask- answer questions or outside
in the hall, so is there

00:20:23.189-->00:20:26.892
anything else that I need a?
Alright thank you so much, sorry
for the demo fail but uh, I'll,

00:20:26.892-->00:20:30.463
I'll have it tomorrow. Thank
you. [applause]
