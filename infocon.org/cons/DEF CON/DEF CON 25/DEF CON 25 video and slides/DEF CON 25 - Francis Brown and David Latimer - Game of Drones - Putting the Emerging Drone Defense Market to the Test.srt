00:00:00.042-->00:00:05.000
>> My name is David Latimer, I'm
uh security sul- consultant at
Bishop Fox. Um this is our part

00:00:05.000-->00:00:10.000
managing partner Fran Brown. Um
we are talk is obviously on
drone defense. Um, we uh, want

00:00:15.458-->00:00:20.458
to take it? [inaudible] We just
had a little technical
difficulty difficulties setting

00:00:27.083-->00:00:32.083
up everything. Yeah, you know
how dumb a God's, they're not
nice. Uh this is my first Def

00:00:39.000-->00:00:44.000
Con presentation, this is his
fifth. [applause] Alright. I
think they'll come in a minute

00:00:50.000-->00:00:55.000
here. [applause] >> Really want
to mess with the guy with the
microphone? 'Cause I'll win.

00:00:57.667-->00:01:02.667
Goons. Drunks. [laughter] Ok,
yeah, is this one. Yeah, ok,
cool. Welcome everybody to Game

00:01:14.417-->00:01:20.167
of Drones. Uh, my name is Fran
Brown I'm a partner at uh Bishop
Fox. It's a cyber security

00:01:20.167-->00:01:24.750
consulting firm. Helps companies
secure their uh, networks and
applications. Sorry for the

00:01:24.750-->00:01:29.000
delayed start. It's a good thing
I had every install I ever
downloaded ever and couldn’t

00:01:29.000-->00:01:34.333
install uh VLC player real quick
and few things on the system to
get it running. Um, we'll go

00:01:34.333-->00:01:39.333
ahead and get started then. It's
an interesting setup, I have to
kind of manage this extended

00:01:42.375-->00:01:49.125
mode with the monitor all the
way down there. Look behind me.
Ok, uh got a lot I want to cover

00:01:49.125-->00:01:53.000
today. I know we're running a
little late already. Um, but
basically I want to get started

00:01:53.000-->00:01:57.417
with uh a quick overview of the
Danger Drone. One, because it's
cool, two because we're gonna

00:01:57.417-->00:02:02.417
give one away to somebody in
here. Yeah, Whoo. [applause]
Yeah, you can handle it. Uh and

00:02:04.958-->00:02:08.958
then uh I I very quickly want to
move beyond that and get into
some of the drone defense

00:02:08.958-->00:02:13.333
products. And the whole industry
of drone defense products and
some of the stuff we're going to

00:02:13.333-->00:02:18.583
do in terms of uh testing out
these uh fun products. And then
uh I'll do a little bit of

00:02:18.583-->00:02:23.208
overview of uh some of the legal
landscape and things that are
happening, wrap up with uh, what

00:02:23.208-->00:02:28.208
the future looks like. Which is
scary and kind of crazy. So
before I even get into the

00:02:31.458-->00:02:36.625
danger drone, I want to talk a
little bit about motivations. Uh
why do we do this talk? Uh why

00:02:36.625-->00:02:41.375
is this important? What are we
going for here? Uh, the there's
basically a couple angles that

00:02:41.375-->00:02:46.417
this put, for the most part um,
when our uh customers come to us
and they say, hey Fran, what do

00:02:46.417-->00:02:50.625
I need to know about drones? Or,
do I need, what do I need to be
looking into for drone services

00:02:50.625-->00:02:55.125
or drone defenses or products or
is this something I need to do?
I want to have good answers for

00:02:55.125-->00:03:00.250
them. And not only that, but I
want to provide a resource uh
with this talk and the research

00:03:00.250-->00:03:04.917
could be a uh, to- have answers
for people as they ask that.
'Cause if you google for drone

00:03:04.917-->00:03:09.583
defenses right now, you're going
to get eight kajillion hits oh
and uh which is just basically

00:03:09.583-->00:03:16.083
all marketing material. Um, uh
and a lot of it is a complete
sham. Um, so I actually put out

00:03:16.083-->00:03:20.083
a real resource that you can
look at and actually get some
real answers when it comes to

00:03:20.083-->00:03:23.833
drone defenses. How many people
here have paid for drone
defenses or going to pay for

00:03:23.833-->00:03:30.292
drone defenses in the next year
with their company or their
organization? No? Alright. Like

00:03:30.292-->00:03:33.750
three people. What are you guys
doing in this talk then? I don't
know. [laughter] >> If it's not

00:03:33.750-->00:03:38.000
a problem now, it will be soon.
Promise. >> Yeah, yeah. Who's
worried about for your house or

00:03:38.000-->00:03:43.000
your kids or something like that
or? A few more. Alright. Cool.
Um, so yeah so uh I I basically

00:03:45.042-->00:03:50.542
started seeing uh, a lot of
crazy articles uh and I I had to
kind of like peek at them after

00:03:50.542-->00:03:54.792
awhile. You see you know popping
or mashable or you see these
eagles that are plucking drones

00:03:54.792-->00:04:01.042
out of the sky and these guys
with these huge like bazookas.
Uh and uh jammer devices and uh

00:04:01.042-->00:04:04.958
and I'm not just finding myself
asking, I saw the eagles and I
was like, I bet I bet I could

00:04:04.958-->00:04:10.000
beat those Eagles. Like,
[laughter] How hard would it be
to beat an eagle? Like with a

00:04:10.000-->00:04:14.792
drone and technology? And bring
you know nature to a science?
Um, has anyone really tested

00:04:14.792-->00:04:19.708
them to see if they work? Um. So
that's kind of how it started
and I started looking into it a

00:04:19.708-->00:04:24.958
little bit more and the more I
kept pealing back the onion, the
more I realized that this uh

00:04:24.958-->00:04:30.542
this industry for the most part
is, to say its in its infancy is
an understatement. Uh and to say

00:04:30.542-->00:04:34.667
most of it is a complete sham in
terms of what's out there is
probably a little more accurate.

00:04:34.667-->00:04:38.917
Um, but to say it's also very
necessary right now uh would
also be true. So it's going to

00:04:38.917-->00:04:45.750
be important to be able to cut
through that stuff. >> Alright
introduction of the danger

00:04:45.750-->00:04:52.458
drone. So, welcome to the danger
drone. Uh you see at the bottom
there, there's a URL, that that

00:04:52.458-->00:04:57.542
the tiny URL, uh, if you go to
that, you can submit to enter
into to be the person that wins

00:04:57.542-->00:05:02.458
the raffle. And we will wrap it
up and ship it to you. A few
people brought up uh, you know

00:05:02.458-->00:05:06.792
uh, you know I I might want to
be, have to carry this back
through uh the airport and stuff

00:05:06.792-->00:05:10.958
like that, so we figured this
would be uh an easier way to do
it. Was anyone uh go to my talk

00:05:10.958-->00:05:17.167
a few years ago with uh RF
detas-, RFID circuit boards? I
gave those out live? That was

00:05:17.167-->00:05:21.125
that was uh a pretty crazy
experience. I think, I think
like five people got killed in

00:05:21.125-->00:05:25.917
the crowd trying to get one of
those circuit boards. Somebody
gave birth it was like people

00:05:25.917-->00:05:30.292
were knocking each other over.
It was like insanity, so to make
it a little more reasonable, uh

00:05:30.292-->00:05:35.292
go to that URL and we'll uh
we'll ship it to whoever wins.
Uh so quick with the danger

00:05:37.667-->00:05:42.667
drone. Basically uh the the long
short of the danger drone is we
created that to be able to test

00:05:46.500-->00:05:50.042
out these drone defensive
products. We wanted to be able
to do penetration tests or

00:05:50.042-->00:05:55.625
product evaluations of people
who are selling uh drone defense
products. Uh and there wasn't

00:05:55.625-->00:06:00.667
anything to do that. I always
kind of looked at it as um, you
know would buy a smoke detector

00:06:00.667-->00:06:04.083
if you had no way of knowing
that it would ever detect a
fire? You need the ability to

00:06:04.083-->00:06:08.500
test these things out. So that
was kind of the uh the origin of
the uh danger drone. And

00:06:08.500-->00:06:13.708
essentially it's just a pe-
pentesting quadcopterIt's base-
a a hacker laptop that can fly.

00:06:13.708-->00:06:18.500
It's uh it's a Raspberry
pi-based quadcopter. So anything
you can install on Raspberry pi,

00:06:18.500-->00:06:23.417
which you can run full Kali
Linux on Raspberry pi and it
will also fly. Um, for doing

00:06:23.417-->00:06:28.208
penetration test. Uh and uh it
has the ability to extend it to
do whatever you want to do in

00:06:28.208-->00:06:33.333
terms of wireless, bluetooth,
Zigby hacking. Um >> We have
custom shelving so you can put

00:06:33.333-->00:06:37.792
your different.. >> Yeah,
created a custom shelf mo- most
quadcopters have, you know, for

00:06:37.792-->00:06:41.667
the two shelves, one for the
battery and one for the flag
controller. We added a third one

00:06:41.667-->00:06:45.250
for your your wi-fi Pineapple or
your you know whatever you want
to add in there to your

00:06:45.250-->00:06:52.167
quadcopter. Um and here is
another one you could plug in.
Plenty open USB ports on it, so

00:06:52.167-->00:06:57.750
Raspberry Pi default for defined
radios. Wifi pineapple, stuff
like that. If the payloads stick

00:06:57.750-->00:07:03.875
on it there. So we'll see it.
Alright, we were having problems
with the audio earlier, so

00:07:03.875-->00:07:08.875
hopefully we have proper sound
here. [inaudible video] >> Oh,
you can kind of hear it. It's,

00:07:30.500-->00:07:36.500
it's, yeah. Ok, restart this.
Hit pause. Hold on. What the-,
We're not on, have to go back.

00:07:36.500-->00:07:41.000
Guys you ready for this.
Especially on audio. Will hit
pause. Alright. Ok so what we're

00:07:41.000-->00:07:45.167
about to see here is uh just a
quick demonstration of what you
would use the danger drone for

00:07:45.167-->00:07:49.083
basically to simulate any kind
of pen test especially over the
air. Uh and in this case we're

00:07:49.083-->00:07:55.542
going to use it to hack a
vulnerable by uh wireless mouse
to uh oh- you know do a drive by

00:07:55.542-->00:08:01.375
at a window and highjack
somebody's computer. Ready. We
nailed this like in two takes.

00:08:01.375-->00:08:05.375
>> [video demo] oh man my
logitech wireless mouse is
awesome. All I need now is

00:08:05.375-->00:08:10.375
another cup of coffee. >> We did
a submission for the Oscar for
uh. [laughter] [applause] >>

00:08:27.167-->00:08:32.125
TLDR, throw away all your
wireless mouse and keyboards
when you get home. Um, yeah so

00:08:32.125-->00:08:36.667
it's a b- it's a pretty uh
pretty easy demonstration of
what's possible. Um you can

00:08:36.667-->00:08:40.625
basically hook up anything you
want to do with, it was a crazy
radio hooked up to that, but you

00:08:40.625-->00:08:45.208
can hook up a wifi panel or
anything like that and just
derive bys and uh highjack

00:08:45.208-->00:08:50.208
people's networks and systems.
With the Danger drone. Um, so
got it at uh URL again. Uh if

00:08:54.000-->00:08:59.000
you want to try to get one for
free. >> This is like parts and
pieces uh uh most of the

00:09:05.833-->00:09:09.583
airframe can be 3D printed we
have all that up on our
thingiverse if you google tes-

00:09:09.583-->00:09:13.167
penetration testors, that was
our project last year, but. >>
Yep, the bulk of it could be 3D

00:09:13.167-->00:09:18.292
printed including the custom
shelf. Uh ADs, basically a
modified Erle Brain three. Uh

00:09:18.292-->00:09:21.500
which is uh those guys are
great, they're from Spain. They
built the qua-, they basically

00:09:21.500-->00:09:24.917
built our Raspberry pi,
basically quadcopter that could
fly and we just added the

00:09:24.917-->00:09:30.500
ability to hack to it. Um you
could build it yourself or uh,
it's even a little bit cheaper

00:09:30.500-->00:09:33.667
now but under five hundred bucks
total for all the major
components that you would need.

00:09:33.667-->00:09:38.042
About three seventy last time I
checked. Um we'll be updating
the website with that new image

00:09:38.042-->00:09:42.083
and things like that later
today, but already up there is
uh the parts list and links to

00:09:42.083-->00:09:46.500
Amazon, stuff that you can do to
get it and um it's all up on our
website right now. If you go to

00:09:46.500-->00:09:51.500
danger drone dot IO or Bishop
Fox dot com, you should be able
to find it. And uh lastly, just

00:09:53.708-->00:09:57.792
been great uh, this has been
good for testing drone defensive
uh products and evaluating them

00:09:57.792-->00:10:01.250
but it's also in general if
you're doing penetration tests
kind of the advent of the

00:10:01.250-->00:10:06.000
internet of things is that
everything is talking over the
air now and having a drone that

00:10:06.000-->00:10:10.542
can hack is kind of the ideal
platform for hacking stuff over
the air, without consequence, uh

00:10:10.542-->00:10:15.958
so it's uh been kind of nice uh
to have this capability and now
and uh with there being more

00:10:15.958-->00:10:21.417
targets than every. Uh in terms
of uh you know hackings you'd be
having. Wifi or Bluetooth or you

00:10:21.417-->00:10:26.417
name it. Cool. Ah so that's the
danger drone. Ah the thing in
the news. Yeah, so. So, uh

00:10:30.417-->00:10:33.833
leaving after this talk,
everyone I've ever met has sent
me every article about drone

00:10:33.833-->00:10:37.458
stuff that they've every seen
and it's been awesome. So thank
you everyone for sending me d-

00:10:37.458-->00:10:41.125
di- did you see this, the
article? Did you see the it's
been crazy. Eh. The news has

00:10:41.125-->00:10:46.875
been great. For this talk in the
last couple weeks alone. Um in
terms of uh illustrating what

00:10:46.875-->00:10:51.542
we're going for here. Um so
three that I just want to point
out and particular kind of

00:10:51.542-->00:10:56.542
illustrate where things are at
uh in in the industry. Do you
get-, do do you guys see this?

00:10:59.375-->00:11:03.875
[laughter] >> We call that
overkill. >> Yeah. Can you can
you just picture those guys

00:11:03.875-->00:11:07.833
doing it like, go ahead do it
man. Go ahead, use use the three
three million dollar uh predator

00:11:07.833-->00:11:11.667
missile, uh patriot missile to
take out the two hundred dollar
quadcopter. I wander if it was a

00:11:11.667-->00:11:17.667
danger drone. I don't know for
sure. Uh that they took out. But
yeah it kind of illustrates that

00:11:17.667-->00:11:23.083
um and wha wha I I kind of an
assurance that this is du- this
is a problem that isn't new it's

00:11:23.083-->00:11:27.458
just new to most people trying
to deal with air based threats.
There are people in the military

00:11:27.458-->00:11:30.167
that are like, oh yeah,
defending yourself against
threats from the air. Yeah, like

00:11:30.167-->00:11:34.083
we've been doing that for awhile
man. Maybe you've seen Top Gun,
or yeah know an anything before

00:11:34.083-->00:11:39.000
that like, so but it's a very ya
ya know, it's just new problem
for a lot of people. A for

00:11:39.000-->00:11:42.333
corporations, for people in
their homes. Uh having the
ability to fly and need to

00:11:42.333-->00:11:47.333
defend against it now. But it
shows that um, uh the military
also kind of needs to a they can

00:11:49.500-->00:11:55.125
they can take out I I think most
quadcopters go at about forty to
fifty miles an hour and I think

00:11:55.125-->00:12:00.583
uh, uh patriot missile goes at
like mock three. Um, so they can
handle these problems, but

00:12:00.583-->00:12:03.708
they're going to need, it's not
really scaleable and they're
going to need to adapt as well.

00:12:03.708-->00:12:08.875
Um as this as the threat
continues to adapt. You see on
the right there as well, it's a

00:12:08.875-->00:12:12.708
one of the pictures, what they
call like a flying IED. People
are distracting grenades to

00:12:12.708-->00:12:19.083
quadcopters um for to drop them
off for suicide missions. Um so
as the threats continue to

00:12:19.083-->00:12:24.750
evolve from a military
standpoint uh so will the
defenses need to as well. This

00:12:24.750-->00:12:27.500
is awesome by the way. I don't
know if any of you guys have
seen this, but a couple weeks

00:12:27.500-->00:12:33.667
ago, some guy escaped from
prison, uh with a drone drop off
some wire cutters over the

00:12:33.667-->00:12:38.208
prison yard to him and they they
ended up catching him a couple
states over. Uh but he was able

00:12:38.208-->00:12:42.958
to break out of prison because a
drone dropped off some wire
snippers to him. Uh in terms of

00:12:42.958-->00:12:46.250
you know, illustrating the
threat, prisons have been one of
people leading the way in terms

00:12:46.250-->00:12:50.292
of needing to adopt drone based
based defenses, but thus far
it's been primarily people

00:12:50.292-->00:12:55.125
dropping in weapons or you know
drugs or things like that. I
think this is the first actual

00:12:55.125-->00:12:59.083
prison escape based on things
that were dropped in by a drone,
um but it kind of shows the

00:12:59.083-->00:13:04.542
escalating nature of the threat.
>> Big problem for anyone who
runs a prison. >> Yeah, yeah,

00:13:04.542-->00:13:09.667
this is a nightmare. >> Alright,
so I don't know if you guys
heard about this. You all know

00:13:09.667-->00:13:14.042
the wil- wildfires going on in
California? There are some
raging in Arizona. This guy got

00:13:14.042-->00:13:19.917
arrested for flying a drone near
a fire to uh video tape and
document it but he was impeding

00:13:19.917-->00:13:23.000
seventeen different aircrafts
from fire- firefighting
aircrafts that were trying to

00:13:23.000-->00:13:28.083
drop flame retardant and uh got
arr- got himself arrested and
he's going to be one of the

00:13:28.083-->00:13:33.500
first uh ones charged under the
uh well >> Yeah, look at this
guys face, this guy is the face

00:13:33.500-->00:13:37.792
of the new threat. [laughter]
Look at, look at that mug shot.
There is this is a fifty-four

00:13:37.792-->00:13:41.917
year old guy, thought it would
make for cool YouTube videos, he
was circling his quadcopter

00:13:41.917-->00:13:45.667
around helicopters of
firefighters and Emergency
responders putting their lives

00:13:45.667-->00:13:51.375
in immediate danger um and he
was posting it up on YouTube as
he was doing it. Uh and it

00:13:51.375-->00:13:55.750
essentially showed the lack of
ability to defend against these
things. What they had to do was

00:13:55.750-->00:13:59.208
they were like all of our lives
are in danger, we have no way of
dealing with this guy, with this

00:13:59.208-->00:14:03.500
quadcopter. We just got to let
the fire burn and go home. Like
that was their response to the

00:14:03.500-->00:14:09.000
situation. Let it burn. Let's go
home. So he goes home. Um which
is obviously isn't going to last

00:14:09.000-->00:14:14.833
going forward. They'll need the
ability to to defend against uh
you know things like that. >> So

00:14:14.833-->00:14:20.042
since we've clearly demonstrated
the need for uh this market
obviously people, there's all

00:14:20.042-->00:14:24.750
different types of industries
that are going to need defenses.
Let's go onto the drone defense

00:14:24.750-->00:14:30.458
part. >> Endangering fourteen
different aircraft. Fourteen.
Substantial risk of imminent

00:14:30.458-->00:14:35.833
death and injury to firefighters
because he thought it would be a
cool YouTube video this this new

00:14:35.833-->00:14:40.833
quadcopter. Alright. Cool. So
that kind of leading the way to
the drone defense mar-. This is

00:14:45.708-->00:14:50.542
I gotta tell I I I've had the
pleasure some pretty exciting
research in my time, pretty fun

00:14:50.542-->00:14:55.167
stuff, this is probably been one
of the funnest and probably also
one of the most ridiculous. At

00:14:55.167-->00:14:58.500
one point somebody in our
company was like what can we do
with this, let's be realistic

00:14:58.500-->00:15:01.958
here. And I was like, realistic
went out the window a long time
ago man. [laugher] Like, we're

00:15:01.958-->00:15:07.167
getting falcons that ger- go
after eagl- eagles going after
drones, you know, air to air

00:15:07.167-->00:15:12.333
hea- combat going on, like I
don't know where realistic fits
in. Um just to give you kind of

00:15:12.333-->00:15:15.125
a break down of what the
different products are that
people are pushing out there

00:15:15.125-->00:15:19.917
right now. Is uh you have
basically air to air and ground
to air for the most part. Most

00:15:19.917-->00:15:26.042
are net based. You have people
who are shooting nets up at
drones from the ground, or um,

00:15:26.042-->00:15:31.208
you know drones themselves
either with big nets or shooting
nets out of other drones. You

00:15:31.208-->00:15:36.917
have predator birds plucking
drones out of the sky. Um, as
well as uh lasers which are

00:15:36.917-->00:15:43.250
pretty fun. Uh they run about
eleven million dollars a pop
though so we didn't get access

00:15:43.250-->00:15:49.042
to one of those. Um. [laughter]
Yeah. But a so ho- he- this this
is what I was seeing in the

00:15:49.042-->00:15:53.333
news, one article and then I was
like, hey I gotta look into
this. This is this is crazy. Um

00:15:53.333-->00:15:57.875
a couple popular examples that
you might see, you got a little
first person view of the eagle

00:15:57.875-->00:16:04.208
coming in with a vengeance. Uh
in the middle top there, I sent
that to every single person I

00:16:04.208-->00:16:10.292
know saying for Christmas this
year, I want one of these guys.
[laughter] Um, yeah, nobody,

00:16:10.292-->00:16:13.625
huh, we found out they cost
about eighty grand a pop and
everyone was like we don't love

00:16:13.625-->00:16:17.625
you that much, you're not going
to get one of these for
Christmas. Uh you see some dog

00:16:17.625-->00:16:21.625
fighting going on there. Looks
like Top Gun, you know they're
getting good missile tone and

00:16:21.625-->00:16:26.542
shooting a net at another drone.
Uh, we'll see here we did uh, we
actually got the test out in the

00:16:26.542-->00:16:30.875
dessert. Kind of one of these
guys in the bottom left which is
a a faster bigger drone. This

00:16:30.875-->00:16:37.833
has a big net dangling from it
that it comes and sweeps up your
drone in the sky. Um, pretty

00:16:37.833-->00:16:42.833
simple solution right. Uh and uh
you got some one of the bazooka
jammers there. As well as

00:16:44.917-->00:16:50.167
another one that's shooting uh a
net at a and then actually
capturing it on the bottom right

00:16:50.167-->00:16:55.167
there. Um so where this is right
now. Eh uh basically uh 2017 was
the year of the drone, both

00:17:00.333-->00:17:05.917
consumer wise and business wise.
People are adopting drones. It
went from that weird RFC toy

00:17:05.917-->00:17:11.083
store on the bottom uh corner of
the mall to you can get them at
the grab aisle in CVS and

00:17:11.083-->00:17:16.125
Walgreens now. That's kind of
like the the transition of
things going mainstream. And uh

00:17:16.125-->00:17:21.125
uh with that as well people are
predicting that by 2022 that the
drone defense product industry

00:17:23.833-->00:17:28.125
is going to be a billion dollar
industry as well. So everyone is
trying to get in on this right

00:17:28.125-->00:17:33.708
now. Ah, we did a research,
you're not meant to see this,
but just give you a

00:17:33.708-->00:17:37.292
overwhelming, both slides will
be available for download as
well, but there was eighty-six

00:17:37.292-->00:17:43.667
different products uh that we
looked at um that were drone
defensive products in some way.

00:17:43.667-->00:17:48.667
Uh from the patriot missile to
lasers to the net bazookas to
the big flying swooping nets um

00:17:51.000-->00:17:54.875
and it depending on, one of the
interesting things is if you
read a top ten drone defense

00:17:54.875-->00:17:59.833
products, uh uh report that you
could buy out there or somebody
you know somebody put together a

00:17:59.833-->00:18:04.958
top five, they're all different.
You might get a different ten
depending on which report you

00:18:04.958-->00:18:09.042
read. Which is weird, right?
Like if you read a top ten life
hackers top ten you know

00:18:09.042-->00:18:14.833
whatever uh you know, software
for doing your taxes, most of
them will be the same depending

00:18:14.833-->00:18:19.375
on where you're looking at
right? This was all over the
board. Uh there is no fancier

00:18:19.375-->00:18:23.250
code when it comes to drone
defensive products right now.
And you have a whole crowd set

00:18:23.250-->00:18:28.708
of people that want access to
that billion dollars coming up.
It really just depends on your

00:18:28.708-->00:18:35.292
situation. Uh, what this has led
to is uh making an extremely
hard for security professions to

00:18:35.292-->00:18:39.667
get any straight answers uh
whatsoever. So this is just,
anybody here from department

00:18:39.667-->00:18:46.375
thirteen? Is there, no? I see
part of this you're not going to
like. Just slides right? Maybe

00:18:46.375-->00:18:52.083
not put your hand up. But this
is this is kind of a perfect
illustrative example of what is

00:18:52.083-->00:18:57.208
occurred due to all this money
coming up. Everyone wanting to
get in on this. Uh this .pdf

00:18:57.208-->00:19:01.917
isn't up anymore but its on the
way back machine you get access
to it. Ha. They put themselves,

00:19:01.917-->00:19:05.625
they did a little matrix of some
of the different drone defensive
products up there. You can see

00:19:05.625-->00:19:10.833
they put themself in the top
right quadrant above like
Lockheed Martin and Boeing and

00:19:10.833-->00:19:15.875
uh who have million dollar
lasers to shoot down like mags
and. So the- they're all the way

00:19:15.875-->00:19:20.958
up in the top right. This was on
the fourth of July 2016. They
didn't even have a b dot one oh

00:19:20.958-->00:19:26.875
product to sell until six months
later. They had nothing except
marketing material. And they had

00:19:26.875-->00:19:31.125
a lot of really slick marketing
material. I mean I'm reading
like New York Times articles and

00:19:31.125-->00:19:35.208
I'm reading Reuter’s articles.
You would think all these things
are real. Oh hey I've read about

00:19:35.208-->00:19:38.542
that and I saw here and gives it
the appearance of legitimacy.
Most people learning have a

00:19:38.542-->00:19:42.542
product to sale. But based on
the amount of money they've
already funneled into marketing

00:19:42.542-->00:19:47.042
you'd think they'd be on version
eight of a product version
nine's coming out next month. Uh

00:19:47.042-->00:19:52.625
and they de- de- they don't have
anything to sale you. And uh, I
I had money, I wanted to buys

00:19:52.625-->00:19:56.458
some of these products and it
was difficult to do it. Uh I
always get e-mails back from

00:19:56.458-->00:20:03.000
their CEO. Uh saying we can't
sell it to you, I think its
running in like a house. But um.

00:20:03.000-->00:20:06.583
>> Here's a perfect example of
great marketing material that
doesn't really make sense. Um.

00:20:06.583-->00:20:11.500
>> Sa- Same company this one
that wasn't even out yet. It was
uh how do they take down drones.

00:20:11.500-->00:20:17.333
Um they mesmerize them.
[laughter] With that th- and the
product is Mesmer. And it's

00:20:17.333-->00:20:23.083
magic. Uh, what it actually did,
what it actually does tot ake a
drone out of the sky. I have no

00:20:23.083-->00:20:28.083
idea. No idea whatsoever. Other
that it mesmerizes it. So you
know I strongly suspect that uh

00:20:30.458-->00:20:34.833
that maybe we can only, I can
only imagine uh what it's
actually doing. Maybe they

00:20:34.833-->00:20:39.583
didn't even decide what it's
going to do yet, so they just
put some ones and zeros. Um, uh

00:20:39.583-->00:20:43.917
we're going to go on some of
these now, but if you guys uh
haven't had a chance to check it

00:20:43.917-->00:20:48.542
out yet, we did uh, we went out
to the desert with a lot of
these products. Um got a lot of

00:20:48.542-->00:20:52.792
sunburn. Like a hundred and ten
degrees out in Arizona. A lot of
really cool drone defensive

00:20:52.792-->00:20:58.083
products with uh and wired did
an exclusive uh there's some
video up on there. Uh where you

00:20:58.083-->00:21:02.958
can check out some of the
exclusive video of us testing
out a lot of these products. I

00:21:02.958-->00:21:07.958
don't want to spend too much
time time on de- detection
mechanisms because the drone

00:21:10.875-->00:21:14.625
defensive products kind of break
down the detection and then the
more interesting response.

00:21:14.625-->00:21:18.583
There's a lot of people in the
detection game, whether it's
just you know radar or acoustic

00:21:18.583-->00:21:22.917
or you know all kinds of fun
stuff coming out, just to, just
to be able to tell you that hey

00:21:22.917-->00:21:28.250
there is a drone in your sky
outside your building. You know
or near you. Um one of the more

00:21:28.250-->00:21:32.958
popular ones is uh Dedrone. And
a lot of, you're seeing a,
you're starting to see a lot of

00:21:32.958-->00:21:38.042
collapsing of people who are
implementing uh response
products are starting to partner

00:21:38.042-->00:21:42.542
up with companies like Dedrone
too. You you spot that there's a
drone there first and then our

00:21:42.542-->00:21:47.292
eagle will come in you know and
and swoop it out of the sky. You
know so its joint partnership.

00:21:47.292-->00:21:52.292
Um. Yeah. So co- hey. Couple
those. Interesting use case with
this uh, the drone shield is um,

00:21:56.833-->00:22:00.542
we're seeing a a one of the
earlier adopters of these drone
defensive products is when they

00:22:00.542-->00:22:05.375
were filming the new star wars
movies, th- the first one of the
new batch. And people were

00:22:05.375-->00:22:10.083
releasing footage of scene
before the movie came out
because they were flying over uh

00:22:10.083-->00:22:15.208
the sets. And uh getting uh
video footage of it. So um
people ask them like how do we

00:22:15.208-->00:22:20.917
prevent these drones from form
uh you know getting any spoiler
alerts on what's going on with

00:22:20.917-->00:22:26.333
Hans Solo or cause you haven't
seen it yet, I won't say. Uh but
um yeah so it's a real it's a

00:22:26.333-->00:22:33.167
real problem. And a real threat.
And a few more. Airports are
adopting them. Although I talked

00:22:33.167-->00:22:37.833
to somebody at the Denver
airport. And nobody seemed to
know what I was talking about.

00:22:37.833-->00:22:42.500
With this uh at Denver airport
implementing Air-fence. To be
able to track uh you know

00:22:42.500-->00:22:46.917
they're piloting this, nobody,
nobody there seemed to know what
the heck I was talking about. So

00:22:46.917-->00:22:52.000
I don't know if its real or not.
Predator birds. Ok. So now we're
getting into the fun stuff. So

00:22:52.000-->00:22:57.708
that was just detection
mechanisms. So drone defensive
products for a response. You've

00:22:57.708-->00:23:04.042
a you've detected a rogue drone
in your vicinity. What are you
going to do now? So if you read

00:23:04.042-->00:23:08.917
any uh, if you read any articles
about, you know, Dutch police
have implemented eagles to to

00:23:08.917-->00:23:12.958
defend about drones or the
French military has done this.
This is all one company. This is

00:23:12.958-->00:23:16.708
all one company that does all
this. Every article that you've
read. It's all one company. Uh

00:23:16.708-->00:23:22.250
guards from above. How much do
you think uh one eagle costs?
Guesses? [audience guesses]

00:23:22.250-->00:23:27.250
Right there, how much, how much
do you think one eagle costs. >>
15K. >> 15K. >> 100K. >> 100K.

00:23:31.542-->00:23:37.417
>> Two million. [audience] >>
Three million. What is the price
is right. Yeah. >> Too low. >>

00:23:37.417-->00:23:42.458
One dollar, one dollar.
[laughter] >> Ok. Ok. Anymore?
[audience] >> Seventy-five

00:23:42.458-->00:23:46.625
thousand. Ten mil- ten million.
What kind of eagles do you think
they got man? [laughter] >> They

00:23:46.625-->00:23:53.250
don't crap gold or anything.
Yeah. So uh I was able to get
access to and just getting

00:23:53.250-->00:23:57.500
access to prices on this stuff,
this is all kept close to the
vest. Um we put an app that kind

00:23:57.500-->00:24:02.042
of researched but I was digging
to get prices on these kind of
products and one of the things I

00:24:02.042-->00:24:06.375
took away from this research is
these people have no idea what
to charge for drone defensive

00:24:06.375-->00:24:11.750
products. They are just throwing
it out there. Ah, it's going to
be four- te- -ty thousand

00:24:11.750-->00:24:17.417
dollars? Uh no, a gah I'll see
if you flinch or not. Um it is
well, oh. See competing products

00:24:17.417-->00:24:22.333
might be five grand and one
might be ninety-five grand uh
that do the same exact thing. Um

00:24:22.333-->00:24:28.208
but in this particular case uh
the initial cost for one eagle
is a hundred and fifty-six

00:24:28.208-->00:24:33.000
thousand dollars. For one eagle.
They live eighty years, but
they're only mission capable for

00:24:33.000-->00:24:38.000
forty years. Um, what do you do
with the other forty years? Let
it be your best friend. Uh.

00:24:40.875-->00:24:44.750
[laughter] Um and it's another
seven grand a year on top of
that for maintenance and food

00:24:44.750-->00:24:49.542
and stuff like that. Yeah, so
quite an investment. So I don't
know who they are selling to. If

00:24:49.542-->00:24:52.167
they're selling to the crowd
that are wasting a three million
dollar a missile on a

00:24:52.167-->00:24:56.667
quadcopter, maybe they are like
this is a bargain, you should go
for this. [laughter] I don't

00:24:56.667-->00:25:02.458
know. Um, yeah. That's what we
didn't get access to one.
Needless to say. Um, we did uh

00:25:02.458-->00:25:06.542
do you want to tell them about
going up with the falcon? >>
Yeah, uh so we tried we actually

00:25:06.542-->00:25:11.708
tried this uh to try to try to
do this in Arizona. Uh we tried
to get, there's only one um

00:25:11.708-->00:25:17.000
group that does like falconry.
Um Arizona Falconers. There's
only fourteen in the entire...

00:25:17.000-->00:25:21.458
>> You want to know anything
about falconry or eagles or the
market. The two people over here

00:25:21.458-->00:25:24.875
can tell you anything and
everything you ever wanted to
know about falcons and falconry.

00:25:24.875-->00:25:30.250
>> TLDR it's not uh an effective
drone solution for the U.S.
because of the animal protection

00:25:30.250-->00:25:34.417
laws. In Britain and the U.K.
and you know places in Europe,
they don't really care if you

00:25:34.417-->00:25:37.833
want to own a falcon. But in
America you can only... >> Yeah,
this will never fly in the

00:25:37.833-->00:25:41.083
United States. >> You can only
own one if you're rehabilitating
it [laughter] >> No pun. For the

00:25:41.083-->00:25:46.458
whole family. >> Yeah, you can't
use it for commercial purpose.
So unfortunately it was a no go

00:25:46.458-->00:25:51.792
for the uh test video. But we
tried. >> Yeah, uh we did we did
get to see one falcon they were

00:25:51.792-->00:25:55.917
going to try to help us out and
it just, it just stood there. It
just sat there. >> It's like

00:25:55.917-->00:26:01.667
nah. >> Nah. So like yeah, if
co- I don't feel like it today.
[laughter] >> He. Yeah, so in

00:26:01.667-->00:26:05.625
terms of security I was like
WSPOs was like I never want to
work with animals or kids

00:26:05.625-->00:26:09.167
because you never know they're
going to do. Um it'd be like
having a firewall that like I'm

00:26:09.167-->00:26:13.375
kind of tired today, I'm not
going to block stuff. You know.
Like, not exactly reliable.

00:26:13.375-->00:26:18.375
Reputable solution. Now with all
this. This is hypothetical, this
is hypothetical. It's highly

00:26:22.417-->00:26:27.417
hypothetical. All I'm saying is
is that I think I can beat an
eagle or a falcon. There are

00:26:29.542-->00:26:34.542
counter measures. Now if we had
gotten access to one, I was
going to do, so you'll see the

00:26:34.542-->00:26:38.250
kind of counter of these, uh,
what are the weaknesses in these
different approaches. And at

00:26:38.250-->00:26:42.458
least as I see them uh and how
do we try to exploit them. So I
would have went for the carrot

00:26:42.458-->00:26:46.833
instead of the stick. I would
have went for bacon wrapped mice
counter measures. I'm almost

00:26:46.833-->00:26:52.583
positive that it would have went
for the food instead of my
drone. If I dropped it off. But

00:26:52.583-->00:26:57.750
you know. If it did want to play
rough. You know I- I I don't
know. Yeah, automatic

00:26:57.750-->00:27:02.750
identification and in response,
uh should not be that difficult
giving what's out there right

00:27:06.208-->00:27:12.042
now. Hypothetical. Ok, drones
shooting. Um, again uh next
Christmas if anyone wants to get

00:27:12.042-->00:27:16.708
me one uh these things look
awesome. I don't know if they
work as well as they do, but

00:27:16.708-->00:27:22.208
these things run about seventy
to eighty grand. Uh they are one
of the more popular uh can- like

00:27:22.208-->00:27:27.375
cannon launch nets. With the
heat seeking and do it even
deploys a parachute with it so

00:27:27.375-->00:27:33.417
it doesn't uh ha- it doesn't
actually break the drone. Um, so
you're going to see different

00:27:33.417-->00:27:39.042
models right? You're going to
see the slow motion flashlike
kind of form factor to shoot

00:27:39.042-->00:27:44.042
down drones. Which at maybe a
little more realistic for um,
one thing I want to point out,

00:27:44.042-->00:27:48.167
there is no best drone solution.
Right? And in doing this you're
gonna have to look at your

00:27:48.167-->00:27:53.917
scenario. Uh what uh interms of
a drone defensive solution for a
warden who's trying to guard a

00:27:53.917-->00:27:58.917
prison yard versus people who
are trying to protect a movie
studio or a set, uh versus a

00:28:01.125-->00:28:04.750
someone that's trying to protect
a celebrity from paparazzi
drones, they're going to have

00:28:04.750-->00:28:08.000
different needs and different
use cases that will necessitate
different uh solutions. You

00:28:08.000-->00:28:10.000
might not have access to
different kinds of uh uh the
prison warden might have access

00:28:10.000-->00:28:15.000
to more options then a normal
person uh this flashlight is
pretty handy for. If you look at

00:28:20.167-->00:28:23.042
the different kind of
breakdowns, you have a prison
yard is something that is a

00:28:23.042-->00:28:29.417
fixed location you want to
defend permanent, right? The uh
star ward film set is a fixed

00:28:29.417-->00:28:34.333
location that isn't permanent.
It's not going to be there
forever. Um if you are guarding

00:28:34.333-->00:28:38.667
Kendra and if you've ever seen
that I won't bust it out you
know Kendra the TV show. You

00:28:38.667-->00:28:43.458
guys know, you guys know what
I'm talking about. Um, and when
she had drones in her yard, if

00:28:43.458-->00:28:47.583
you're defending a celebrity
that's mobile uh and is in a
fixed location, having a little

00:28:47.583-->00:28:53.375
flashlight that you can go
around with you, you can shoot
out, is an ideal solution. Yeah,

00:28:53.375-->00:28:58.208
so how can I beat these things,
right? So I started looking at,
you got these eighty thousand

00:28:58.208-->00:29:03.208
dollar net cannons. Um you have
hundred thousand dollar uh, uh
fighter drones that shoot nets

00:29:05.750-->00:29:10.333
out at you. Though most of these
defense solutions are net based.
And most of them are really

00:29:10.333-->00:29:14.500
light nets, because it's gotta
carry themselves and it's gotta
shoot them. So they rely not on

00:29:14.500-->00:29:18.667
the weight of net pulling you
do, they rely on the net getting
caught up in your motors. Mo-

00:29:18.667-->00:29:23.792
most of these defenses is tens
of thousands dollar defenses, uh
to be able to take down your

00:29:23.792-->00:29:28.333
drone. So I thought could I beat
some of these uh the flashlight
ones are like six seven hundred

00:29:28.333-->00:29:33.708
bucks. Uh uh some of the other
ones are like you know twenty
thirty grand. Um could I beat it

00:29:33.708-->00:29:38.708
with like fifteen dollars worth
of chicken wire. Um and the
answer is yes. We could.

00:29:41.042-->00:29:44.958
[laughter] >> So. Counter
measures yeah can we get around
or ten. Alright. We'll want to.

00:29:44.958-->00:29:51.333
We'll do some videos here. So
this one I think we're testing
out the net gun counter friend.

00:29:51.333-->00:29:54.750
Um counter measure. [video demo]
>> This is Fran Brown from
Bishop Fox and we're testing a

00:29:54.750-->00:30:01.292
net gun, but variety, which is a
gun that we wired with chicken
wire. >> So and take the time to

00:30:01.292-->00:30:08.083
appreciate how good of a shot
this is. Oh. So that's the
flashlight based model. that's

00:30:08.083-->00:30:14.042
about twenty feet. So products
that go forty-five feet. I would
think it would go forty-five

00:30:14.042-->00:30:21.542
feet. >> You would think. [video
demo] >> See most net based
projectile uh drone defense

00:30:21.542-->00:30:25.833
weapons uh need to be light to
get further, so the the weight
itself won't weigh down the

00:30:25.833-->00:30:30.792
drone. They rely on getting
caught up in the motors to make
a drone crash. Uh just some

00:30:30.792-->00:30:34.750
simple like twenty dollar
chicken wire bubble around this
was enough to prevent the the

00:30:34.750-->00:30:41.250
net from falling into the motors
and allowed us to still be able
to fly. Um, just. >> Ten dollar

00:30:41.250-->00:30:44.667
chicken wire and zip ties.
Effective drone defense. >>
That's just chicken wire and zip

00:30:44.667-->00:30:49.208
ties that I wrapped around and
uh stop it. [applause] >> We
defeated your eighty thousand

00:30:49.208-->00:30:53.917
dollar net gun. >> Uh, I know
we're running uh, I know we're
running short on time, so just

00:30:53.917-->00:30:59.042
in case I don't get to it, I was
talking to one of the other air
to airbased net uh uh people who

00:30:59.042-->00:31:02.750
sell products and I was
explaining how I was going to
use the chicken wire. They're

00:31:02.750-->00:31:05.583
like what kind of test you
running? Uh we have a prototype,
maybe we can send it t you and

00:31:05.583-->00:31:09.083
get it going? I explained what I
was going to do. And they're
like, uh no, maybe, I don't

00:31:09.083-->00:31:12.750
think we could sell you are
product 'cause I don't think
it's gonna work. Uh. [inaudible]

00:31:12.750-->00:31:27.333
This one. So yeah so there's
plenty of uh net guards out
there and people have do it

00:31:27.333-->00:31:31.125
yourself ones, but oh those
flashlight ones go for like five
six hundred uh seven hundred

00:31:31.125-->00:31:37.042
bucks in some cases. And now. I
will say, we have one demo for
this guy. Have any of you guys

00:31:37.042-->00:31:42.042
seen these like shotgun shells?
With nets in them? Uh these
these worked way better than I

00:31:42.042-->00:31:45.500
thought they were going to work
and the cheapest out of anything
we tested. It's about twenty

00:31:45.500-->00:31:49.708
bucks for three shells. And uh
they were the only net based
thing that we tested that

00:31:49.708-->00:31:54.458
actually beat my chickenwire
cage. Uh because it's basically
still shooting even as a net,

00:31:54.458-->00:31:58.625
it's basically shooting metal
out of a shotgun. And stuff. >>
Punched a hole right through the

00:31:58.625-->00:32:06.458
net. >> Punched a hole right uh.
[laughter] [video demo] >> First
uh, we're gonna go ahead and try

00:32:06.458-->00:32:12.250
a sky net shotgun shells. Uh
which are twelve gauge shotgun
shells that have deploy a net uh

00:32:12.250-->00:32:16.042
specifically to try to take down
droves. >> This kind of shotgun
shells are one of the simpler

00:32:16.042-->00:32:20.375
drone defense options available.
Just twenty dollars for three
and they can be fired from any

00:32:20.375-->00:32:23.625
traditional shotgun. The
difference of course is the
netting which wraps around the

00:32:23.625-->00:32:28.208
drones propellors and take it
down. >> Sky nets are extremely
effective and cheapest out of

00:32:28.208-->00:32:32.417
all solutions by far. From
seventy feet out it took them
three to five shots per drone.

00:32:32.417-->00:32:38.625
>> That's the metal piece that
went into that. >> So you can
see this. >> So we can see here

00:32:38.625-->00:32:45.208
looks like if we. >> Shoot out
of the sky. >> [inaudible video]
right here do you that he blew a

00:32:45.208-->00:32:48.875
hole in the metal piece that
went straight through it.
[laughter] >> Yeah, so we just

00:32:48.875-->00:32:59.292
put some like cartoon like
shockgun holes in in the uh
chickenwire there. Um, and we

00:32:59.292-->00:33:05.125
when you think like net you know
ammo you think somewhat safe or
partially safe, this I I think

00:33:05.125-->00:33:13.042
you would actually die if you
got shot with the uh this stuff.
Um, [inaudible]. So we'll just

00:33:13.042-->00:33:17.875
go to some videos. We'll go to
the best one. >> We're gonna go
to the really fun one now. >>

00:33:17.875-->00:33:23.208
Yeah, so one thing I want to say
about this. >> [video demo]
Lastly the pista de resistance

00:33:23.208-->00:33:28.750
oh the big guy, we have uh the
sparrow hawk attached to. >> So
one, one thing I want to say

00:33:28.750-->00:33:32.292
about this is um and I I'll fly
some of these guys, you look
through our slides out of the

00:33:32.292-->00:33:37.125
air to air base drone defense
products, right, I called all of
them. All of them are either uh

00:33:37.125-->00:33:43.542
they're they're about to release
their v two any day now and they
checked the shelves. Bob check

00:33:43.542-->00:33:48.000
the shelves their's no more v
one left. Almost none of them
actually sale any product. Uh,

00:33:48.000-->00:33:51.792
you know th- th- you got years
going back with some of the
products uh they're winning

00:33:51.792-->00:33:55.917
awards and and eventually you
find out, like we're hoping to
ship our first round of products

00:33:55.917-->00:33:58.917
by the end of this year. It
looks like they've had products
out for years. I only counted

00:33:58.917-->00:34:02.833
one company that out out of the
air based ones that would
actually sell me and it was a

00:34:02.833-->00:34:09.208
prototype for some air to air
base combat. And it's one of the
ones in the nature of, it drops

00:34:09.208-->00:34:16.000
a huge nets and tries to scoop
in on it. [video demo] >>
Lastly, the pista de resistance,

00:34:16.000-->00:34:22.792
uh the big guy, we have uh the
sparrow hawk attached to a huge
DGI M six hundred uh drone and

00:34:22.792-->00:34:27.333
uh essentially it's gonna be
some air to air combat. It's
going to try to go catch up with

00:34:27.333-->00:34:31.792
the danger drone with a really
big net and swoop it up to try
to capture the drone. >> I love

00:34:31.792-->00:34:36.417
how it's kind of crazy there. >>
No. >> By far the most expensive
option we tested. The drone and

00:34:36.417-->00:34:40.750
the net system together come
close to around eleven thousand
dollars. >> About eleven grand.

00:34:40.750-->00:34:46.125
Well th- th- the real cost is
the actual drone itself. Which
is, the filmographers use the

00:34:46.125-->00:34:50.500
same exact drone, its a DGIM six
hundred. Uh but a couple
interesting things here. They

00:34:50.500-->00:34:54.292
did sell us one. You sen- you
never on referral by hand,
you're supposed to be able to

00:34:54.292-->00:34:58.333
doit uh I was, do you have an
instruction manual for this? And
the guys like can you give us an

00:34:58.333-->00:35:02.208
extra day? I was like.
[laughter] >> What? Like you
send it to me? They're writing

00:35:02.208-->00:35:08.000
it as you go right? This guy
sends me five pages of just pure
text. Not a single picture, not

00:35:08.000-->00:35:11.958
a single image. It's be like if
I shipped you a box full of
bicycle parts and like a million

00:35:11.958-->00:35:17.083
parts and just like just pros,
just text being as articulate as
I can describing how to build a

00:35:17.083-->00:35:21.000
bicycle. And I I you know can
you take a photo with your phone
or something man? He's like,

00:35:21.000-->00:35:24.875
it's pretty straight forward.
It's like, naw, it's pretty much
the exact opposite of straight

00:35:24.875-->00:35:29.875
forward. [laughter] Uh. Yeah
it's not straight forward even
in the least bit. Um but we were

00:35:29.875-->00:35:38.500
able to get it going anyway. >>
So that that is an, what you saw
right there is an interceptor

00:35:38.500-->00:35:43.333
type obviously air to air
interceptor type. >> Yeah. Um
they cost too much in terms of

00:35:43.333-->00:35:47.875
defenses against that I was
really debating having with
those ones that have those swoop

00:35:47.875-->00:35:51.750
in, they have to get really
close to you and they have to
come in from a predictable

00:35:51.750-->00:35:54.792
direction right. Just chasing me
and instead of come from behind
me. And I wanted to use a

00:35:54.792-->00:35:59.625
confetti gun uh do like maverick
style. As I'm bringing him in
closer, letting him get closer

00:35:59.625-->00:36:04.167
and use a confetti gun out the
rear. So basically fart confetti
on it and make it crash the big

00:36:04.167-->00:36:11.125
drone. Which I'm pretty
confident would have worked, but
its pretty expensive a gamble at

00:36:11.125-->00:36:14.375
this amount of time. Would the
chicken wire stop it in that
case? I think it would probably

00:36:14.375-->00:36:17.292
grab one of the chicken wire.
The chicken wire is more about
the one that shoot the net at it

00:36:17.292-->00:36:20.958
hoping that the net will take it
down. Um I think it would
actually probably rip up the

00:36:20.958-->00:36:24.250
chicken wire. >> I think part of
the other problem is if they
have a faster drone then your

00:36:24.250-->00:36:28.750
interceptor drone, there's
nothing you can do right. >> Um,
so let's get to these real

00:36:28.750-->00:36:33.083
quick. This drone catcher is one
of the one's you'll see the
most. It's got like dog fighting

00:36:33.083-->00:36:38.083
stuff going on. It's got stuff
going back like years. Uh I
found uh in some YouTube uh

00:36:38.083-->00:36:42.167
subtitle translations from
their, they say it's gonna be
about thirty thousand euro. Uh

00:36:42.167-->00:36:47.125
for one of em. Uh and even with
all this stuff going back years
and years, they're really hoping

00:36:47.125-->00:36:51.417
to ship their first batch of
products by the end of this
year. Uh can't buy it right now.

00:36:51.417-->00:36:55.875
Uh Airspace, they wouldn't even
get back to me. They got back to
one of our people saying it cost

00:36:55.875-->00:37:01.708
a millions of dollars. Um to
shoot basically shoot a net at
it in the air. Uh this is from

00:37:01.708-->00:37:07.208
Michigan. Uh a little research
project. And this one's
interesting. Excipio. This was

00:37:07.208-->00:37:10.583
Excipio. Uh doing the way back
machine, it was thirty-five
hundred bucks for one of these

00:37:10.583-->00:37:15.625
net shooter Excipio back in
December. Uh they've rebranded,
they're gonna be called Drone

00:37:15.625-->00:37:19.833
Hunter, you can't buy the old
Excipio anymore. Drone Hunter is
not for sale yet, but is it went

00:37:19.833-->00:37:24.542
from thirty-five hundred to
forty-seven thousand five
hundred dollars. In a couple

00:37:24.542-->00:37:29.417
months with no clear identific-,
I said so what's gonna be
different about it? And it's

00:37:29.417-->00:37:33.708
gonna be uh, I think we were
like, we're charging how much?
We need to charge more than

00:37:33.708-->00:37:36.208
that. So pricing is all over the
board right now. >> Basically
you ask and called in the price

00:37:36.208-->00:37:40.125
and they're like who are you?
And if you're government they
add a couple zeros. >> Yeah,

00:37:40.125-->00:37:48.000
yeah I have a bunch of these
guys with the the Sparrow that
we tested. I found a uh a PBF

00:37:48.000-->00:37:50.792
with an old invoice from the end
of the year for uh it was
twenty-five thousand Euro for

00:37:50.792-->00:37:55.250
one of these other guys. We
bought ours for actual sparrow
was only five thousand pounds.

00:37:55.250-->00:38:00.708
Uh itself so, versus twenty-five
thousand Euros for a similar
product. Um you can see they are

00:38:00.708-->00:38:07.000
all over the board. Sparrow. >>
Jamming, oh you see all these
go- none of these guys can sell

00:38:07.000-->00:38:10.125
in the United States and they
won't be able to. Yeah, you see
all these articles about these

00:38:10.125-->00:38:14.292
jamming devices for the most
part, you can't jam GPS, you
can't jam cellphone connections

00:38:14.292-->00:38:20.167
which is what the danger drones
uses for command again control.
Um they're not allowed to sell

00:38:20.167-->00:38:24.000
this in the United States. Um
and they and they won't be. Any
time, the foreseeable future.

00:38:24.000-->00:38:31.458
Yeah, this is basically doing
reverse turnover cell phone
connection full USB uh 3G

00:38:31.458-->00:38:36.708
adapter to control the uh danger
drone. Making it pretty much uh
uh impossible for most of these

00:38:36.708-->00:38:43.250
jammers to the ones that are
legal to buy anyway to work
against it. >> Guys I know we're

00:38:43.250-->00:38:46.875
uh running short on time, we'll
have uh be able to take
questions back there if you. >>

00:38:46.875-->00:38:50.667
Lasers, ok lasers. Ok, so these
run or directed energy weapons.
These things are cra-, these

00:38:50.667-->00:38:55.792
guys are Boeing are like, maybe
we just make a little dumb down
version of the ones we use to

00:38:55.792-->00:38:58.958
shoot like real planes out of
the sky. Like fighter jets. Uh
so they're kind of just made

00:38:58.958-->00:39:01.833
like a you know they're not as
good as a department thirteen up
in the corner there. Uh...

00:39:01.833-->00:39:07.208
[laughter] But um, yeah. They
created these auto-tracking like
uh eh- basically eh eh drone

00:39:07.208-->00:39:12.583
going crazy fast, just like
auto-tracking no problem you see
it burst into flames with direct

00:39:12.583-->00:39:17.500
energy weapons. Um these things
I think Boeings are eleven
million dollars a unit. And I

00:39:17.500-->00:39:20.583
think think um, I think it's
like break down runs about six
million dollars a unit. But

00:39:20.583-->00:39:23.042
you're looking at a million
dollars for one of these guys.
Throw it on the back of your

00:39:23.042-->00:39:27.917
truck to uh to knock these out.
Um you see them there, but
they're putting them on ships

00:39:27.917-->00:39:31.958
and trucks basically deploying
them. Uh they can be beat now.
They can be beat. Now most are

00:39:31.958-->00:39:36.708
gonna be, I bet I could beat
these lasers. Um. Basically uh
China was talking all kinds of

00:39:36.708-->00:39:41.833
crap saying we could, uh we
could beat most of uh the US's
lasers with just smoke bombs.

00:39:41.833-->00:39:47.750
Well like they eh- may actually
be true. Um, smoke and dust and
obscurance really degrades the

00:39:47.750-->00:39:53.042
ability to use these. Um putting
mirrors, flashing mirrors in
your drone uh to uh to ward off

00:39:53.042-->00:39:58.458
the laser. Um, one of my
favorites is the meta-materials
which bends the uh light and

00:39:58.458-->00:40:02.292
energy around a kind of like
predator, do you'd be looking
like predator drone. They

00:40:02.292-->00:40:05.667
actually had, you wouldn't look
like predator. But that's
something similar in terms of

00:40:05.667-->00:40:09.542
like like displacing the heat
energy. And uh the last one,
there's actually a project and a

00:40:09.542-->00:40:13.667
product that somebody does that
has auto tracking that detects
that a laser is on you on your

00:40:13.667-->00:40:19.750
drone and immediately responds
with another laser back uh.
[laughter] Not yeah. So there's

00:40:19.750-->00:40:23.083
a whole people sells these
products. It's pretty cool. >>
Try to confuse the. >> Again we

00:40:23.083-->00:40:26.375
didn't have millions of dollars
to test this stuff out, but
maybe, maybe next year. Yeah.

00:40:26.375-->00:40:33.250
Uh, legal issues. Um, this guy
is a hero. It's just some random
guy basically anyone who

00:40:33.250-->00:40:36.250
registered their drones last
year, you can get your money
back. This guy was like, this

00:40:36.250-->00:40:39.792
law is just bullc**p man. I'm
suing. I'm suing the government
and he won. So the registration

00:40:39.792-->00:40:43.083
loan law from last year got
thrown out. Couple months ago.
Um an- [applause] Ok, we're

00:40:43.083-->00:40:50.000
gotta wrap up. Yep. [applause]
Um, one last things with the
shot guns and uh uh web people

00:40:50.000-->00:40:53.417
are like why don't you just
shoot a regular shotgun at that
point? Uh and like this guy did.

00:40:53.417-->00:40:57.000
He's shooting above his house
with his kids and all. I don't
know if you guys have ever seen

00:40:57.000-->00:41:00.208
anyone poke a LiPo battery
that's in these guys? They're
basically like lava bombs. That

00:41:00.208-->00:41:04.292
are like that might blow up for
no reason whatsoever, let alone
if you're shooting a shotgun at

00:41:04.292-->00:41:08.958
it. Um, and it will spit flames
everywhere. So not something you
want to do in a residential

00:41:08.958-->00:41:17.625
area. Uh trying to shoot these
guys out of the sky. Uh and yep.
And the future's awesome. Um uh

00:41:17.625-->00:41:21.875
drone swarms. None of these
defenses are gonna work about
drone swarms. Um none of these

00:41:21.875-->00:41:25.708
nets, you get if I send five
thousand drones it's not going
to do anything against. I know a

00:41:25.708-->00:41:30.000
couple, yeah you know, these
nets aren't going to do anything
uh super small bug sized drones.

00:41:30.000-->00:41:34.125
Hybrid approaches. We have one
of these spiders so a drone
could just drop off a spider and

00:41:34.125-->00:41:39.292
it could crawl on a building
could plug in an ethernet port.
Uh stuff there. Uh or you'll see

00:41:39.292-->00:41:43.375
like submarines that are coming
up just long enough to shoot
something in the air off or UPS

00:41:43.375-->00:41:46.583
trucks that are driving in your
neighborhood and then deploying
a drone. A hybrid approach is

00:41:46.583-->00:41:50.500
going to be big in the future
and uh yeah micro bug size. And
under water drones. Under water

00:41:50.500-->00:41:55.167
supremacy. Navy's kind of
leading the way. You think air
when you hear drones. Drone

00:41:55.167-->00:41:59.458
swarms. No one's thinking uh
naval supremacy and a million
little uh Raspberry pi based

00:41:59.458-->00:42:04.500
submarines. Uh just controlling
the ocean and uh that's kind of
a big deal still, but nobody

00:42:04.500-->00:42:09.917
thinks about it. Oh and uh
Raspberry pi based uh somebody
released uh some dog fighting AI

00:42:09.917-->00:42:14.917
stuff, full of Raspberry pi
which is being real. So I think
some next Top Gun coming out, I

00:42:14.917-->00:42:18.708
think it's gonna be all
Raspberry pi like you know.
Yeah. The uh the plot for the

00:42:18.708-->00:42:22.958
alternate's down in the other
Raspberry pi rumor. You know
some of that. But a pretty free

00:42:22.958-->00:42:27.542
game of speed in the sky
non-stop. Um and that's uh
that's it. We're out of time.

00:42:27.542-->00:00:00.000
Thanks guys. [applause]
