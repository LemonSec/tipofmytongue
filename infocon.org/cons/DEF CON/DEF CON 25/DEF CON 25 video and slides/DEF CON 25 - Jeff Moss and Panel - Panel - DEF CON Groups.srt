00:00:00.375-->00:00:07.167
>>I am not Jeff Moss [inaudible
talking] Just FYI. I am not the
dark tangent uh it’s like we get

00:00:07.167-->00:00:13.542
confused all the time. Um, I’m
Jayson E. Street but uh, Jeff
couldn’t be here because there

00:00:13.542-->00:00:18.833

uh, to do, obviously. Uh,
[laughter] which is okay

00:00:18.833-->00:00:23.833

I’m the DCG ambassador. Uh,

00:00:39.333-->00:00:45.125
because I travel all over
everywhere uh, so they just
thought hey and I like Def Con

00:00:45.125-->00:00:49.583
anyway and I talk about it
everywhere so they put me in
there as the ambassador. We got

00:00:49.583-->00:00:54.583
Brent White, uh B1TKILL3R. The

Jayson. >>So. Hi! >>Nice of you
to join us. >>[audible talking]

00:01:50.125-->00:01:54.583
>>So a little bit about uh,
things that I do is uh, this is
a actual uh picture uh from a

00:01:54.583-->00:02:00.875
Def Con Group meeting. I, last
year uh trying to make uh Def
Con Groups a little bit more

00:02:00.875-->00:02:07.375
Global. Uh, I took it apon
myself to travel uh, even more.
Uh, and I went through Asia

00:02:07.375-->00:02:10.583
because there was not that many
Def Con Groups in Asia so, I
literally started out in

00:02:10.583-->00:02:16.250
Beijing. Uh went to Hong Kong,
Shin Jin, Singapore, and
Thailand. Uh, talking to uh

00:02:16.250-->00:02:22.833
hackerspaces and makerspaces uh
in all those cities trying to
get them to start up. Uh, I am

00:02:22.833-->00:02:28.875
happy to say that uh things are
actually, Jun Li’s here. It's
like we’ve got a Def Con Group

00:02:28.875-->00:02:33.750
now in Beijing uh, Hong Kong,
Shin Jin and Singapore. So uh
that's really cool. They,

00:02:33.750-->00:02:39.167
they’ve already had meetings,
they’re uh doing really good
work. Um, and uh so this is the

00:02:39.167-->00:02:44.208
one from Hong Kong. Got started
off there and we've also working
on getting some Def Con Groups.

00:02:44.208-->00:02:49.583
WE’ve got one started in Garden
Route and Johannesburg and South
Africa. We’re working on another

00:02:49.583-->00:02:57.708
one in uh Close Napoca Romania
and uh we’re trying to make it
way more global. And, oh ya.

00:02:57.708-->00:03:02.208
There’s some other pictures of
me as I’m traveling. It’s like
uh, that's from Singapore. >>The

00:03:02.208-->00:03:07.208
robot Def Con Group right? >>Ya,
uh I was trying to uh hey, I do
not discriminate. It's like it’s

00:03:07.208-->00:03:11.667
it’s a global inclusive
community, robots as well. Cause
they're our new overlords. Uh,

00:03:11.667-->00:03:17.667
not everybody appreciated how I
did ambassadorship, uh some uh
were a little bit more uh uh

00:03:17.667-->00:03:24.792
handsy or less handsy than than
I like so but they worked out.
Uh, this was a great meeting in

00:03:24.792-->00:03:30.042
Singapore with uh Jeff Moss.
That’s actually Jeff Moss, the
one in the middle. Uh, and then

00:03:30.042-->00:03:34.750
Deno Desavi uh, at the news
hacker space uh, the news uh
hacker meeting, which was really

00:03:34.750-->00:03:41.458
cool. And uh, then this is uh
Adrian from uh the Garden Route.
He started the Garden Route uh

00:03:41.458-->00:03:49.792
Def Con group. So, um I think
this um the the State of the
Union is really good. We’re

00:03:49.792-->00:03:54.583
getting a lot more global uh
[cough] and I mean we got, we’re
getting uh, Def Con Group

00:03:54.583-->00:03:59.792
inquiries from uh Columbia, from
uh Turkey, it’s uh from Europe,
it’s like we’re getting a lot of

00:03:59.792-->00:04:04.167
great um initiatives. It’s like
for Def Con Groups coming out
and we’re expanding that which I

00:04:04.167-->00:04:11.083
think is very important. Uh, Def
Con Groups is not a uh, Western
centric or US centric uh

00:04:11.083-->00:04:17.292
organization. It should be you
know, everybody. Um, and what
we’re doing now and with the new

00:04:17.292-->00:04:21.250
initiative that we’re working on
um that I, I literally just said
you know, yolo, let’s try to

00:04:21.250-->00:04:27.458
make this happen. So, it’s gonna
either be spectacular or fail
spectacularly but either way,

00:04:27.458-->00:04:32.750
spectacular. >>Jayson, >>Um,
>>can I interrupt you for a
second? >>Yes. >>You’re killing

00:04:32.750-->00:04:37.708
the captioner. >>Killing the
caption? >>You, you’ve got to
slow down. Look at that thing

00:04:37.708-->00:04:41.333
over there. >>Oh. [laughter] I’m
talking to fast. [Laughter] Wow.
[Laughter] I didn’t know that’s

00:04:41.333-->00:04:45.750
going on. [Laughter] Alright
[Laughter] OMG. [Laughter]
>>Laughter! [laughter] You guys

00:04:45.750-->00:04:55.208
got in there, you’re on the
board! Wooh! [whoops] [yelling]
[applause] >>Oh, that’s so cool.

00:04:55.208-->00:04:59.500
[Laughter] >>Okay >>They gotta
say everything? Oh sorry. I’m
sorry, I’m getting distracted.

00:04:59.500-->00:05:04.042
Okay, >>Squirrel! >>My, [laughs]
>>Squirrel! >>Alright. >>I love
pizza. Okay um. Okay sorry.

00:05:04.042-->00:05:13.542
Okay. >>Bring it back. >>Okay
sorry, socially initiative that
we’re going to do is um I was at

00:05:13.542-->00:05:19.708
a uh uh crime conference thing
for small businesses that were
thrown by um, that was thrown

00:05:19.708-->00:05:25.542
together by Homeland Security in
Tennessee. Uh, Memphis. Which is
of course where you think of

00:05:25.542-->00:05:30.417
when you think of Homeland
Security uh and one of the guys
there, one of the feds whose

00:05:30.417-->00:05:35.167
name he does for some reason he
doesn’t want me to say what his
name is uh here. It’s like uh

00:05:35.167-->00:05:39.708
though everybody would be able
to get a free t-shirt. Um, he
was very >>It was Jayson Street.

00:05:39.708-->00:05:44.583
>>Ya. He was very interested in
uh the initiative that I talked
to him about, about having Def

00:05:44.583-->00:05:51.625
Con groups all over the world
connect with law enforcement.
Cause that seems natural and

00:05:51.625-->00:05:55.833
like, just totally cool right?
You know, like chocolate and
peanut butter. Um, but the

00:05:55.833-->00:06:03.250
reason why is I want to see the
Def Con Groups to connect and
get involved with uh uh this

00:06:03.250-->00:06:10.875
initiate contact with law
enforcement so the law
enforcement can introduce the

00:06:10.875-->00:06:19.083
Def Con Groups to schools. We’re
going to create a script that
were going to put up on our

00:06:19.083-->00:06:23.500
website, and we're going to put
reading materials and
documentation for schools on our

00:06:23.500-->00:06:31.125
website for online safety, and
what hacking is and what and how
to protect yourself online and

00:06:31.125-->00:06:37.292
instead of having police
officers and law enforcement
people who come over and to talk

00:06:37.292-->00:06:42.000
about the evil hackers that are
breaking into your Facebook and
your Instagrams, were going to

00:06:42.000-->00:06:48.375
have vetted Def Con Group
members come to schools and tell
children and students what

00:06:48.375-->00:06:55.375
hacking is, what it’s about, and
how to protect themselves.
[Coughing] Going to a school, an

00:06:55.375-->00:07:00.292
elementary school, as a hacker
in your hoodie going hey I want
to talk to your kids about

00:07:00.292-->00:07:06.375
online safety. [Laughter] That’s
not gonna work out so well. But
if we can actually get law

00:07:06.375-->00:07:12.167
enforcement to actually to you
know, serve us a little bit
here, it’s like then we can

00:07:12.167-->00:07:17.417
actually use the system to help
us further the message and the
positivity of what hacking

00:07:17.417-->00:07:25.167
really is. And I want that to be
a global thing not just um uh
just a US thing. So it’s like

00:07:25.167-->00:07:30.042
we're already talking about it
to other uh countries, to other
groups, uh to talk to the law

00:07:30.042-->00:07:35.583
enforcements in their country
and get an engagement and engage
with them. Uh, so you pick like

00:07:35.583-->00:07:42.417
2 Def Con Group members that uh
you know will pass a background
check, that or one, if you and

00:07:42.417-->00:07:46.042
if you know the certain groups
it’s like you can get one. It’s
like you know. >>You can only

00:07:46.042-->00:07:52.000
get one. [laughter] >>Exactly.
It’s like so if you can get one,
it’s like have them be the the

00:07:52.000-->00:07:57.000
point man and then have that
going. So we’re going to start
working on that uh, Brent is

00:07:57.000-->00:08:01.792
going to be working with the Fed
because he’s in Nashville. um,
that’s where he’s stationed out

00:08:01.792-->00:08:07.583
of. And they’re the DC615 in
Nashville. So that’s going to be
our pilot project but once that

00:08:07.583-->00:08:12.667
gets hammered down, I want this
everywhere by the end of the
year. It’s like we're hackers

00:08:12.667-->00:08:17.958
are going to schools and telling
kids what it’s like and how to
protect themselves, and what

00:08:17.958-->00:08:23.125
hacking is. Let’s change the
narrative there and then go
outward. So, that’s what I’d

00:08:23.125-->00:08:34.458
like to hope we can start.
[applause] >>So uh, something I
want to add on to that Jayson,

00:08:34.458-->00:08:39.500
so um, my daughters in
elementary school. My wife and I
went and spoke uh for career day

00:08:39.500-->00:08:45.125
and uh so I talked you know,
spoke about hacking and you know
what hacking is and then all

00:08:45.125-->00:08:50.208
this stuff and so uh, it I
thought it went really well but
as we were leaving, the kids

00:08:50.208-->00:08:54.625
were at lunch and I think this,
I think this kid was in second
or third grade and he goes oh uh

00:08:54.625-->00:08:58.458
you're the one that spoke about
hacking? And I was like ya, and
he’s like so can you like, teach

00:08:58.458-->00:09:03.167
me how to break into banks where
cops don’t see me? And I was
like no, wait wait you’ve got

00:09:03.167-->00:09:07.500
this all wrong. [laughter] It’s
uh So uh we’ve gotta make sure
that those conversations don't

00:09:07.500-->00:09:11.917
come up in this initiative or.
>>See, it’s not technically
wrong, I mean >>Ya >>it’s what

00:09:11.917-->00:09:15.542
Jayson does. >>Well but, he
would no but but but he was like
you know where the cops can’t

00:09:15.542-->00:09:18.333
see me and stuff. >>Oh. >>And I
was like you need to stop
watching so much TV there kid

00:09:18.333-->00:09:21.875
so. >>Right. >>So anyway, >>As
long as you have the paperwork
you’re good right? >>Ya >>Ya

00:09:21.875-->00:09:31.500
[laughter] >>Alright [laughter]
you’re up. >>Hi. Uh, so I’m
gonna talk about what Def Con

00:09:31.500-->00:09:39.333
groups are or more like where
they came from as well. So, uh,
I’m Grifter from DC801. Uh, DC

00:09:39.333-->00:09:51.875
801 and DC 719 are are or were
are the original Def Con groups.
Um so, [noise] [laughter] hold

00:09:51.875-->00:09:57.333
on. I want to see if it says
like Jayson opening diet Pepsi
on the captioner. [Laughter]

00:09:57.333-->00:10:01.750
>>It does now. [laughter]
>>what? [laughter] >>It does
now. >>Sound of carbonation

00:10:01.750-->00:10:09.125
escaping the bottle. >>Pssssh
[laughter] >>Jaysons spewing on
the floor. [laughter]

00:10:09.125-->00:10:21.917
>>psssssssss >>We broke him.
[laughter] um. Okay, so, so
basically they came about cause

00:10:21.917-->00:10:28.458
we um we had a pretty good group
of folks out in Salt Lake City
which is where DC801 is from. Uh

00:10:28.458-->00:10:36.125
and we were running 2600 SLC. We
had I think at the time that we
flipped from a 2600 meeting over

00:10:36.125-->00:10:41.667
to the concept of a Def Con
group was um about 50 people
would show up every month in a

00:10:41.667-->00:10:46.750
food court and kinda descend on
it and have a mini con which was
really cool. Um, but it

00:10:46.750-->00:10:54.875
basically came about because at
the time, 2600 magazine was uh
by a lot of people in the group,

00:10:54.875-->00:10:59.583
getting political. LIke it was
actually telling people like oh
you should vote like this if you

00:10:59.583-->00:11:06.750
want to support these things and
if you’re a hacker you should be
voting this way instead of more

00:11:06.750-->00:11:12.458
like uh regardless of what their
political views are that’s just
not cool. So, um, we said well

00:11:12.458-->00:11:16.583
what can we do where we can
still have a good name around it
and then have this group thing

00:11:16.583-->00:11:23.375
and so um I talked to DT and
said hey, what do you think if
we did this? And he was like

00:11:23.375-->00:11:29.458
that sounds awesome, talk to
Russ. And Russ is, he was in
DC719 um, so I called up Russ

00:11:29.458-->00:11:35.083
and we kind of worked things out
over the course of a about a
month or two and then we

00:11:35.083-->00:11:39.792
launched our meetings and we had
them. We started them in
February and then we announced

00:11:39.792-->00:11:44.333
them in the summer. The next
summer at Def Con. So they had
been going on for about 6

00:11:44.333-->00:11:48.208
months. Uh, they’re awesome. I
mean like. >>It was Def Con 12
right? >>Uh, >>Or Def Con 13?

00:11:48.208-->00:11:53.792
>>Ya it was, it was early on.
>>It was Def Con 12 or 13. I
don’t remember which but it

00:11:53.792-->00:11:59.875
started there. >>For sure. Wait,
yes. Because we were still at
the AP. >>Yup. >>Ya. Alright.

00:11:59.875-->00:12:06.000
Um, so now Def Con groups are
everywhere. They’re all over the
world. So, um, if you’re looking

00:12:06.000-->00:12:11.292
to join a group you know check
the website, see if you can find
one that’s already established

00:12:11.292-->00:12:19.333
and if you don’t see something,
please start one. Um, so, how do
you start one? >>Wait, wait.

00:12:19.333-->00:12:22.583
>>What? >> Hey Grifter, what’s
the website? >>What, what is the
website? [Laughter] Isn’t hasn’t

00:12:22.583-->00:12:37.542
it been on every slide? >>Ya.
>>Oh alright. [laughter] Dear
captioner, please type Def Con

00:12:37.542-->00:12:43.667
groups dot org. [Laughter] >>No.
>>D****t [laughter] >>Close
enough >>Oh [laughter] >>Close

00:12:43.667-->00:12:50.917
enough >>I’m outta here now.
>>OH, that’ll work. >>Look what
you did. [Laughter] Look what

00:12:50.917-->00:12:55.958
you did. [laughter] >>WWW dot
DEFC [laughs] Oh no. That’s
messed up. [Laughter] Now they

00:12:55.958-->00:12:59.917
got it. >>Alright. >>Alright.
We’ve gotta stop messing with
the caption person. Um,

00:12:59.917-->00:13:04.500
[laughter] So ya so go to the
Def Con groups website. Look for
um, uh, a group that’s around

00:13:04.500-->00:13:11.333
you, and if there isn’t one
start one. And when I say if
there isn’t one, that doesn’t

00:13:11.333-->00:13:13.625
mean if there’s one that’s 30
minutes away and that’s too far
so you should start another one

00:13:13.625-->00:13:18.958
like, get in the car or on a bus
and and head over there. I think
that was something uh that

00:13:18.958-->00:13:24.000
started to happen with 2600
meetings as well. Where it was
like there was one here and then

00:13:24.000-->00:13:32.375
there was one like 5 blocks over
because people didn’t wanna
commute so. >>Alright so the

00:13:32.375-->00:13:35.208
next things like um how do you
get people to attend? It’s like
that I’m given a lot of the

00:13:35.208-->00:13:38.500
questions when people are uh
approaching me and I’m talking
to them in different areas and

00:13:38.500-->00:13:41.417
uh and in different places and
they’re saying like well uh how
do I get people to attend? Well

00:13:41.417-->00:13:48.417
well what's really going to be
drawn what do I do with it. And
the first thing I tell people

00:13:48.417-->00:13:54.083
it’s like you start if you get 2
people at your first Def Con
group meeting, awesome. [claps]

00:13:54.083-->00:13:58.083
>>Yes [applause] >>That’s great.
That’s a good start. It’s like
You know and you just work from

00:13:58.083-->00:14:03.125
there. It doesn’t have to be oh,
we didn’t get 20 people showing
up. IT’s like uh it’s gotta

00:14:03.125-->00:14:08.750
start organically so it’s like
you got people by word of mouth,
it’s like you’ve got social

00:14:08.750-->00:14:12.208
media. I know people that are
starting uh starting with just
facebook pages because they

00:14:12.208-->00:14:18.250
don’t have website yet. Um, so
start off by that. Start uh by
broadcasting that on Twitter. Um

00:14:18.250-->00:14:24.875
um CC the Def Con groups uh
Twitter handle and we will
amplify that for you or you know

00:14:24.875-->00:14:29.833
James will amplify that for you
and uh it’ll get that word out.
So, you can start doing it that

00:14:29.833-->00:14:35.667
way. Just start finding a good
location that’s uh central for a
lot of people to get to in a

00:14:35.667-->00:14:40.625
nice area where they uh usually
have alcohol some for some
reason helps. Uh, it’s like it

00:14:40.625-->00:14:47.125
maybe a projector screen you
know even better. Um and start
if off there. It’s like start

00:14:47.125-->00:14:52.292
getting people to show up by
like giving them something to
show up too. You can’t just say

00:14:52.292-->00:14:56.875
hey you wanna sit around, get
drunk and talk hacking? It’s
like Which actually works for a

00:14:56.875-->00:15:01.292
lot of people but you know, uh
but you gotta do something like
have a talk start a talk

00:15:01.292-->00:15:06.708
somewhere. Uh Get involved. Defc
and another thing key thing I
want to make sure we understand,

00:15:06.708-->00:15:12.958
Def Con groups does not replace
or surplant any other
organization that’s going on in

00:15:12.958-->00:15:20.292
that city. IT’s like if you
can’t say well I wanna start a
Def Con group but you know uh uh

00:15:20.292-->00:15:27.750
there’s also 2600 or a city sec
or you know, some other hacking
or security related uh group

00:15:27.750-->00:15:32.375
going on too so no I can’t do
there. That’s not what it’s
about. IT’s like there’s got

00:15:32.375-->00:15:37.250
there’s always room for more
people connecting and being
together and working to make

00:15:37.250-->00:15:42.583
things happens so uh don’t let
that be an excuse, don't’ let
that be a reason you’re not

00:15:42.583-->00:15:47.125
starting a Def Con group in your
area. >>Ya so >>That was the
longest sentence I’ve ever

00:15:47.125-->00:15:50.792
heard. >>You’re welcome >>Ya
[Laughs] So one of the >>I I’m
going to inter interrupt you

00:15:50.792-->00:15:56.542
know. Some practical advice on
finding uh a location. Um, what
we found in London there’s a lot

00:15:56.542-->00:16:04.083
of really uh good setups like um
nightclubs, and bars, so on that
don’t actually open until quite

00:16:04.083-->00:16:10.417
late. So our one of our first
locations was um a night club
that gets going at midnight and

00:16:10.417-->00:16:16.500
we don't want to to be having uh
uh a group meeting starting at
midnight so they’ve got space

00:16:16.500-->00:16:21.833
that's all set up with
projectors in the bar and lights
and space and so on and it’s

00:16:21.833-->00:16:27.958
standing empty um and it’s in
cent the center of London so uh
we’ve found we could actually

00:16:27.958-->00:16:33.208
get into that space really cheap
uh, well free in fact because
um, generally you don't get

00:16:33.208-->00:16:38.667
charged to use a bar or a
somewhere there that serves
food, if you bring enough people

00:16:38.667-->00:16:44.542
in that they actually start you
know paying um giving money over
the bar or buying food and and

00:16:44.542-->00:16:48.500
and so on, so they didn’t charge
you for use of the room and
we’re done by 11, 12 so that’s

00:16:48.500-->00:16:54.458
the point where they’re gearing
up for their main business. So
we’re giving them a use for

00:16:54.458-->00:17:00.250
their empty space uh and and
actually we um, that’s how we
got started so ya. We we ended

00:17:00.250-->00:17:07.125
up moving to a pub because they
were charging us night club
prices for drinks even though we

00:17:07.125-->00:17:11.708
weren’t in a nightclub. Well we
were in a nightclub but we’re
not in a nightclub environment

00:17:11.708-->00:17:16.667
if you know what I mean so. >>It
so, some of the things that we
did for uh DC615, uh you had

00:17:16.667-->00:17:22.250
mentioned you know, how do you
get people to attend? So, one of
the things that we did uh we had

00:17:22.250-->00:17:27.500
a really good B sides um
conference that goes on uh with
Little Loss and then uh we have

00:17:27.500-->00:17:32.417
uh Jeff and some other people
that were kind enough to let us
you know, do a quick little

00:17:32.417-->00:17:37.667
blurb doing the opening ceremony
and they were able to carve out
a little room for us to talk to

00:17:37.667-->00:17:42.042
go um people and and tell them
about the group. Uh you know
websites, social media obviously

00:17:42.042-->00:17:46.875
uh and then you know college
campuses if they let you hang up
fliers, um, and you know and the

00:17:46.875-->00:17:53.167
and the technology room and
areas like that to kind of get
the word out. Um, and I’m glad

00:17:53.167-->00:17:57.042
that you mentioned that to about
how we're not trying to compete
with other meet ups and that’s

00:17:57.042-->00:18:01.875
one of the things uh you know
Nashville we have, there’s quite
a few uh other meet ups that go

00:18:01.875-->00:18:06.125
on and so before we even started
the group we did some research
and made sure that we weren’t

00:18:06.125-->00:18:11.083
stepping on anyone's toes, cause
that’s the last thing we want is
to get you know politics and and

00:18:11.083-->00:18:18.542
um any drama involved in that so
uh so we were pretty careful
about that. >>I didn't know we

00:18:18.542-->00:18:22.583
weren’t supposed to compete with
the other meetings like we have
gangland style fights with them.

00:18:22.583-->00:18:26.125
>>Well [Laughter] if that it
that’s cool. >>Ya a dance off.
>>We want a dance off. >>Well ya

00:18:26.125-->00:18:32.667
ya well dance off. >>Oh ya.
>>Break dance fighting. Um, no
we do um some similar things you

00:18:32.667-->00:18:39.292
know we have uh a couple of
local conferences that take
place um in Utah, Saint Con, and

00:18:39.292-->00:18:45.042
Eastside Salt Lake City, and
Hack West and so we work with
those guys to get the word out

00:18:45.042-->00:18:49.750
at those events. Um to your
point, college campuses thats,
thats a big one. Um we go and

00:18:49.750-->00:18:56.083
put flyers you know around the
CS department you know or up on
any boards and stuff that were

00:18:56.083-->00:19:01.333
there as well as um if there are
still are any existing book
stores in you area [laughter] um

00:19:01.333-->00:19:07.250
we would put flyers like in you
know Linux journal or you like,
like minded magazines uh and

00:19:07.250-->00:19:13.292
we’d get people from that as
well. >>Know what? Let, the
frequency of meetings. We forgot

00:19:13.292-->00:19:17.458
to mention the frequencies of
meetings. Some people have em
for um every month, it’s like

00:19:17.458-->00:19:22.000
once a month. It’s like uh I’ve
heard some that's had it like
every 2 weeks which is like, I

00:19:22.000-->00:19:27.667
don't know anybody that would
want to sit here 2 weeks. Um,
but they have those and so some

00:19:27.667-->00:19:32.042
have em like every quarter. So,
it depends on what kind of
frequency you want to have it,

00:19:32.042-->00:19:38.292
It’s not, there’s no set
frequency. [coughing] >>Cuh uz
it’s my turn? >>Ya you can go

00:19:38.292-->00:19:42.042
ahead. >>Okay, okay, okay so,
I'm going to mil- milk that
captioner. I hope everybody here

00:19:42.042-->00:19:47.708
can survive. Uh I’m I”m I come
from China I’m un I’m let me sit
down kay, I come from china, I

00:19:47.708-->00:19:57.833
started Def Con group Beijing,
the Def Con group 0100 and uh we
have like a frequently we we

00:19:57.833-->00:20:04.375
meet very frequently we have
like over uh 200 people every
meeting and uh regarding the

00:20:04.375-->00:20:09.583
frequency of meetings I think uh
all all the regarding the
competition, I don’t think that

00:20:09.583-->00:20:14.583
you should compete with other
conference because we are
different, we are unique. Uh,

00:20:14.583-->00:20:19.292
for example I think the Def Con
group because uh we are so we
are meeting so quite frequently

00:20:19.292-->00:20:24.042
I don’t think this is contest to
be enough so ver too advanced
too like too complicated to uh

00:20:24.042-->00:20:36.792
to to uh like new to so ya uh I
think we were are now having
meeting like uh every 3 months

00:20:36.792-->00:20:44.542
and uh uh a small meetings a uh
uh maybe per month I think
maybe, it just just a few people

00:20:44.542-->00:20:52.833
and also I have the uh chat
group to discuss some certain
stuff so ya. And uh the

00:20:52.833-->00:20:56.625
different group I think you the
countenance need to be busy and
the the tech in the audience is

00:20:56.625-->00:21:01.875
different. The tech in the
audience for our group I think
is more like the college

00:21:01.875-->00:21:09.958
students anduh like the uh
amateur practitioners. And uh so
it’s different you don't don’t

00:21:09.958-->00:21:16.250
have to compete with uh other
conferences and uh regarding the
how to get people to come and

00:21:16.250-->00:21:22.458
the I think that as you are
organizing this event you have
to make this event uh uh

00:21:22.458-->00:21:29.875
meaningful thing with stuff to
do. So I found it frustrating
when i when uh the attendees is

00:21:29.875-->00:21:35.792
very interesting the lockpicking
village because uh we have
another version of village so

00:21:35.792-->00:21:42.500
peoples can discuss uh different
areas like the cryptography, uh
straight printing and other

00:21:42.500-->00:21:51.708
stuff but uh peoples tend to uh
go to the uh the uh lock picking
village. So I found that's quite

00:21:51.708-->00:21:55.167
quite frustrating because as a
hacker you need to know the
cryptography, reverse

00:21:55.167-->00:22:00.000
engineering and the environments
it creates and that stuff. So I
talked is Jayson your uh on the

00:22:00.000-->00:22:04.833
taxi and uh I found out the
reason that I felt this is
because it’s more like you can

00:22:04.833-->00:22:09.125
touch it you can feel and touch
it and see the results instantly
so I start to think So I, now

00:22:09.125-->00:22:17.750
the the next meeting I’m
planning to do uh uh this. I I
build a robot which you can

00:22:17.750-->00:22:23.958
control via a web interface and
the it’s a robot is connected to
a cloud using uh wifi so you can

00:22:23.958-->00:22:29.958
do wireless, you can do you can
do web penetration tests at
penetration to control the robot

00:22:29.958-->00:22:35.583
and finally you can play with my
cat so [laughter]that this turns
the information like uh uh

00:22:35.583-->00:22:43.333
expertise in ex so you can use
our expertise to get some like
physic feed back so that's how I

00:22:43.333-->00:22:49.875
can get people’s attention and
then we made all those swags.
Very cool, so they can uh like

00:22:49.875-->00:22:54.417
when you publicize this kind of
stuff, they can they want it
well they will come so that's

00:22:54.417-->00:23:00.208
the first time to uh shock them
and see this. >>To the um the
the point about not competing

00:23:00.208-->00:23:04.917
competing with other entities
uh, us and uh in the bayou down
down in Baton Rouge, we actually

00:23:04.917-->00:23:10.042
work really close with uh the
local Maker Group and uh we
found that our our disciplines

00:23:10.042-->00:23:15.208
while different like they’re
more hands on with electronics
and everything, we’re more about

00:23:15.208-->00:23:19.625
the technical software side of
things. They mesh well so, we
actually share makerspace, we do

00:23:19.625-->00:23:25.667
presentations there with them,
um there they bring unique um
viewpoints to a lot of the

00:23:25.667-->00:23:31.250
products that we work on and we
we bring viewpoints, our unique
view points to what they what

00:23:31.250-->00:23:38.292
they’re working on too. So um,
and it works out well for us so
far. >>So um then I guess uh

00:23:38.292-->00:23:42.708
next for we’ll kind of go down
the line and quickly talk about
some products that we do I know

00:23:42.708-->00:23:47.458
Jun Li you already kinda
mentioned a few which sound very
interesting. So I know um just a

00:23:47.458-->00:23:52.125
few that we’ve done in
Nashville, um you know as Jun Li
mentioned as well, we try to

00:23:52.125-->00:23:58.083
keep things uh you know
different levels. People that
are just wanting to learn very

00:23:58.083-->00:24:02.750
basic things, all the way to
having things more advanced for
those who are interested uh, so

00:24:02.750-->00:24:07.583
we try to consider that. So uh
something fun that we did, uh we
got we all got raspberry pi’s,

00:24:07.583-->00:24:13.375
built a retro pi. Um, and so you
can see we kinda took it a few
steps further with the wireless

00:24:13.375-->00:24:17.250
controllers and the uh wireless
keyboard and things like that.
>>That’s hot. >>Ya it’s pretty

00:24:17.250-->00:24:20.792
cool. It’s pretty sexy, huh?
[Laughter]Ya, you know. So um so
and then, we >>I’m gonna need

00:24:20.792-->00:24:24.750
the plans for that. [Laughter]
>>Ya, okay. So, those are
actually on our website at DC615

00:24:24.750-->00:24:33.375
dot org so if you’re interested
in that. Um, >>So that’s how you
join DC 615. [Laughter] or 201.

00:24:33.375-->00:24:38.500
>>Ya or 201, there ya go. So um
and another thing that we, I
don’t I don’t have a picture of

00:24:38.500-->00:24:41.458
it but another thing that we did
too with the raspberry pi’s, we
uh implemented the touch screens

00:24:41.458-->00:24:44.500
and uh taught people how to
install the kali linux distro
and then uh changed the kernel

00:24:44.500-->00:24:48.958
weren’t where you know where the
touch screen would work with
that. So that was a little bit

00:24:48.958-->00:24:54.500
more advanced for for uh for
them so that was that was fun.
Uh heres a, this was one of our

00:24:54.500-->00:24:59.500
very first meetings. Um we also,
this is Ski Boy. Uh Ski Boy’s
awesome if you ever get a chance

00:24:59.500-->00:25:06.083
to hangout with him, um smart
dude. But, this is and so we
actually uh in Nashville it’s

00:25:06.083-->00:25:10.542
it’s kinda hard to find places
that are, that are open and you
don’t have to pay a whole lot of

00:25:10.542-->00:25:15.458
money for so um this I think was
at Chris Scott Cyber Assassin.
He’s a member of our group. Um

00:25:15.458-->00:25:19.792
he, this was at the clubhouse of
the apartments that he was
staying at downtown and then uh

00:25:19.792-->00:25:26.583
currently we have uh Dan
Augustine who is at another uh
very nice place downtown and

00:25:26.583-->00:25:31.042
we’re able to use his clubhouse
and uh it’s furnished and you
know have they have pool tables

00:25:31.042-->00:25:34.625
and everything too so that’s
that works out. Uh One of the
things we like to focus on too,

00:25:34.625-->00:25:38.250
if you’re if you’ve never
presented before or you have a
topic that you are that you are

00:25:38.250-->00:25:42.792
presenting and you want to do a
dry run you know we’ll we’ll
we’ll go through those things as

00:25:42.792-->00:25:49.708
well. Um our DC615 badge uh, my
batteries actually fell out on
the way over here so. Uh But

00:25:49.708-->00:25:54.542
yeah the L they LEDS and then we
also have it where you can
program the Arduino and scroll

00:25:54.542-->00:25:59.292
whatever message you want or you
can make them super bright and
troll people at parties where

00:25:59.292-->00:26:04.125
they can’t see anymore. >>Not
very cool [laughter] >>Jayson
>>So ya there’s a picture of

00:26:04.125-->00:26:09.542
that um and then here’s a
picture of of a lot of us
actually spending time soldering

00:26:09.542-->00:26:16.292
and teaching people how to
solder basic electronics and so
on, so um. Soups, you up? >>Ya

00:26:16.292-->00:26:21.083
um so this, back to the point
about reaching out to kids, we
uh we go to the uh maker fair

00:26:21.083-->00:26:25.625
and so this is at the library
every year. Um There’s a bunch
of different groups from around

00:26:25.625-->00:26:30.042
the area, um and we have a
little booth to kind of display
our projects that we’ve worked

00:26:30.042-->00:26:34.500
on throughout the year as well
as uh just kind of spread the
word about what, what we do. Um

00:26:34.500-->00:26:40.667
We do [laughs] we do lockpicking
uh a lot and like you were
saying it’s ikt kind of helps

00:26:40.667-->00:26:47.292
the whole tactile um aspect of
it. Getting people kind of into
the scene uh helps out alot. You

00:26:47.292-->00:26:55.042
can go to the next one. Uh ya
this contraption. Um, it’s
actually a remote controlled

00:26:55.042-->00:27:00.083
Roomba. He hacked it and uses a
controller to actually move it
around, I think he added a

00:27:00.083-->00:27:04.583
little horn to it as well,. It’s
rather cute. Um I’m not entirely
sure what he’s doing with the

00:27:04.583-->00:27:09.208
neck and the screen as of yet.
He’s still working on it. Uh, he
actually had an AK47 attached to

00:27:09.208-->00:27:13.542
it for a little while which is
kind of scary. >>It looks like a
telepresent. >>Ya. He wanted to

00:27:13.542-->00:27:18.750
put like a a microphone on it so
it’s talk out. I don’t know if
he’s gonna use a megaphone or

00:27:18.750-->00:27:24.042
what but it’s getting kind of
top heavy right now. [Laughs]
>>Next, next one? >>Yeah, go

00:27:24.042-->00:27:30.083
ahead. Um We have a really smart
kid, his name uh he he goes by
he goes by Cryo uh and this was

00:27:30.083-->00:27:35.000
a gameboy that he hacked. He
actually, he actually just found
a couple of vulnerabilities in

00:27:35.000-->00:27:40.000
some the original Pokemon games
uh that he’s utilized to kind of
do speedy runs but he at one

00:27:40.000-->00:27:48.417
point hacked a uh little logo on
there for us so. Uh were
actually als also working on, a

00:27:48.417-->00:27:53.042
couple of years ago we worked
with the Cyberpatriot program
which is an Air Force initiative

00:27:53.042-->00:28:00.167
to go out to schools and train
um high school students for a
competition that they end up com

00:28:00.167-->00:28:05.333
competing out throughout the
year and um it works. It works
really well with with the new

00:28:05.333-->00:28:09.167
initiative that were going on
with Def Con groups is. It
basically gives us an an avenue

00:28:09.167-->00:28:18.208
to kind of communicate what what
security is and and that hackers
aren’t all bad so. >>Just mostly

00:28:18.208-->00:28:21.542
>>Most of us. [Inaudible words]
Jayson’s kind of shady
sometimes. >>Um sorry I don't

00:28:21.542-->00:28:25.958
have pretty pictures cause I'm
I’m a busy person and I don’t
respond to email. Um, [laughter]

00:28:25.958-->00:28:31.542
the >>That’s true! >>True story.
>>IT is true. It’s fair. You
gotta, you gotta text me, here’s

00:28:31.542-->00:28:37.750
my number. Um, no. That’s not a
that’s not a thing. uh so ya, so
projects that we work on um DC

00:28:37.750-->00:28:41.417
801 um do we do a lot of things.
ONe of them probably the
flagship project for us is the

00:28:41.417-->00:28:47.375
hackerspace in Salt Lake City
which um is called 801 labs. Um
WE uh basically do all of our

00:28:47.375-->00:28:52.833
projects out of there. That’s
where we have our meetings, so
when we have a meeting it’s it’s

00:28:52.833-->00:28:59.375
at a hackerspace, Jayson has has
been out there before. Um WE
have a lockpick village, and

00:28:59.375-->00:29:05.875
tamper evident room, a hardware
hacking room and like all other
kinds of dedicated classroom

00:29:05.875-->00:29:11.167
where teach each other different
things and were when we do the
DC 801 meetings we have like a

00:29:11.167-->00:29:17.542
webcam that we stream everything
um to Youtube so when the talks
are done for that month they’re

00:29:17.542-->00:29:22.708
immediately available online.
>>Did you take that webcam out
of the bathroom finally? >>Uh

00:29:22.708-->00:29:26.500
no, that one’s still there. The
bathroom webcam will be there
forever. [Laughs] That’s, would

00:29:26.500-->00:29:33.375
be silly to remove it.
[Laughter] What, what are you
saying down there? Just tell us.

00:29:33.375-->00:29:39.917
>>Start the Q and A in 3
minutes. >>Start the Q and A in
3 months. Thanks. >>Uh, it’s my

00:29:39.917-->00:29:46.667
turn? >>Yes. >>Yes it’s your
turn. >>Okay uh I’d like to uh
share with you my how so what’s

00:29:46.667-->00:29:50.500
we're going to talk about now,
should we talk about now. >>What
are those nanoparts? >>Uh this

00:29:50.500-->00:29:55.542
this is nano village is way way
waY what they did so because uh
people's interest are different

00:29:55.542-->00:30:01.750
so I started to like mimic the
Def Cons to like to the nano
version villages so. I put

00:30:01.750-->00:30:08.000
actually thanks to the support
of my team, these are all my
team’s gadget. This equipment

00:30:08.000-->00:30:15.292
all come from my team. So the
you as you can see later I let
all the the this. Yes yes.

00:30:15.292-->00:30:22.875
Actually I I did a talk at uh at
a presentation back at our
hacking car king because I we

00:30:22.875-->00:30:28.000
have many members in on my team
and their are many differences.
So those those are the speakers

00:30:28.000-->00:30:36.042
on the the supporters of Um so
yo ucan see ma ma many of them
come from my team and uh the the

00:30:36.042-->00:30:41.125
places we we meet is in the comp
my companies meeting room so
thanks for the support of my my

00:30:41.125-->00:30:47.792
supervisor my my- leaders. The
the also, the money come from my
company. Yes Yes so if you want

00:30:47.792-->00:30:52.625
to find a place you don’t have
to lad clap a because the
conference room or meeting room

00:30:52.625-->00:31:00.417
in your company most likely is
empty so you can use that as
well. Uh You can see how many

00:31:00.417-->00:31:04.958
people we have and yes so there
more villages and uh we also
post a video of the the meetings

00:31:04.958-->00:31:13.042
online so were were we
cooperated with this is online
education uh website. They were

00:31:13.042-->00:31:20.083
like doing free for us, to
record it and publish it for
free. It’s Integrity a Tech from

00:31:20.083-->00:31:25.167
from China and uh yes, next one?
Malfunction. [inaudible talking]
>>Yeah. >>Okay hey um so one of

00:31:25.167-->00:31:32.750
the things we did in the London
group uh is try to make sure
that it’s not um cliquey and

00:31:32.750-->00:31:37.000
it’s very inclusive to everyone
who comes along. So one of the
first things we do at every

00:31:37.000-->00:31:42.708
meeting that we’ve done right
from the very beginning is
everybody in in the room

00:31:42.708-->00:31:48.042
introduces themselves and we get
to know each other um obviously
if you don’t wanna introduce

00:31:48.042-->00:31:53.042
yourself as your real name or
you work for the man or
something than you make

00:31:53.042-->00:31:58.000
something up. Um, but that way
you know we get people talking
and we reintegrate the the black

00:31:58.000-->00:32:03.708
shirt wearing um hackers from
the basements through alcohol
and cuddles and talking so. Um

00:32:03.708-->00:32:12.042
we concentrate on content so we
don’t do projects together, we
don’t do building um because

00:32:12.042-->00:32:17.208
we’re in uh [coughing] London
and there aren’t any other
groups in the UK at the moment

00:32:17.208-->00:32:23.458
uh a lot of people travel from
quite far to come to the meeting
so we have a couple of talks uh

00:32:23.458-->00:32:29.500
and then you know uh uh
basically we have like an hour
long serious talk where people

00:32:29.500-->00:32:34.458
are expected to concentrate, and
by the time we get to the second
talk because we’re in a pub um

00:32:34.458-->00:32:39.000
probably not quite so
concentrated and focused so we
have like a funny wacky talk

00:32:39.000-->00:32:43.708
usually. something that’s not
necessarily specifically
technically hacking but

00:32:43.708-->00:32:49.083
something we as a hacking
community would find
interesting. So we’ve had talks

00:32:49.083-->00:32:55.083
about um you know home home made
torches, how to make a really
bright torch or how to make uh

00:32:55.083-->00:33:01.125
thermic lance or fireworks or
crap like that so things we
we’ll find quite fun. Um I think

00:33:01.125-->00:33:08.458
we’re quite keen to get to Q and
A so I won’t take up anymore of
your time. >>[inaudible talking]

00:33:08.458-->00:33:11.667
>>Waz? Waz is doing something
else man he doesn’t care.
>>Actually you have a lot more

00:33:11.667-->00:33:16.417
time. >>Oh [laughs] >>Eff
[laughter] >>I would like >>NOw
he tells us >>I would like, I

00:33:16.417-->00:33:22.125
would like to add one more
thing. Uh uh regard uh as Jayson
has said that we should go to

00:33:22.125-->00:33:28.125
the remote areas to teach the
kids to start uh in the the to
know what they they can do, so

00:33:28.125-->00:33:32.917
I’m planning to like bring my
Def Con group to the remote
areas to teach the kids the

00:33:32.917-->00:33:36.583
basic stuff. How to [inaudible]
electronics, how a computer
works, [inaudible] I think that

00:33:36.583-->00:33:44.875
would be meaningful if you guys
want to do it with me I thinks
it will be better so ya. Oh, I

00:33:44.875-->00:33:53.375
named this Def Con hacker tour
but Jays, Jeff said that you
should add it geroup so I I name

00:33:53.375-->00:34:01.750
it like Def Con group hacker
tour. So wha uh actually uh to
deal with the government it’s

00:34:01.750-->00:34:07.583
very hard so I got to kind of
support of my company’s my
colleagues, they are deal they

00:34:07.583-->00:34:13.042
usually they are very good at
dealing with them so they uh all
uh actually there alrady

00:34:13.042-->00:34:22.833
projects that uh where the
anyways for the schools to teach
the kids so I would a corporate

00:34:22.833-->00:34:26.000
them to go to the uh remote
areas so that was to dealing
with the government or the

00:34:26.000-->00:34:33.292
police won’t be a problem for
me. >>Very good. Any questions?
>>Ask them to come upfront.

00:34:33.292-->00:34:36.958
>>What? Huh? >>Ask [inaudible
words] >>Ya. If you, if you have
some questions for us, if you

00:34:36.958-->00:34:41.458
could if you could come up here
when you ask the question.
There’s a purpose for that I I

00:34:41.458-->00:34:46.375
promise it’s not >>Cause we want
to put you on the spot so come
on up. >>No pies in the face,

00:34:46.375-->00:34:50.125
promise. >>But I wanna I wanna
ask a question first. Can you
please raise your hand if you’re

00:34:50.125-->00:34:56.833
already currently in a Def Con
group? That’s awesome, very
cool. >>That’s not enough

00:34:56.833-->00:35:00.708
though. >>How many people want
to get into a Def Con group now
that they’ve been to this panel?

00:35:00.708-->00:35:09.000
EVen better! Awesome. [coughing]
okay Yes. >>So uh I’ve tried to
start a Def Con group locally

00:35:09.000-->00:35:13.417
and I’m just waiting, I haven't
gotten any response from like my
submission and so I’m like

00:35:13.417-->00:35:19.708
scared to move forward with like
buying swag and advertising and
stuff like that cause I need to

00:35:19.708-->00:35:24.708
ensure I’m not going to like,
>>When, when >>You don’t need
permission hack the system just

00:35:24.708-->00:35:29.208
do it. >>Exactly. When did you
send it out? >>Mid May. >>Oh.
[Laughter] Then you should've

00:35:29.208-->00:35:32.083
gotten a response. [Laughter]
>>Okay >>You’re in the right
spot for an answer for that

00:35:32.083-->00:35:36.667
though now. >>That’s why I’m
here. >>There you go. Awesome.
>>It went in the black hole.

00:35:36.667-->00:35:39.667
>>Yup. The the man right there
next to you, is the guy who to
talk to about getting that uh

00:35:39.667-->00:35:45.583
taken care of immediately.
>>Thanks. >>Awesome. Yes? >>Hey
guys, >>Hey. >>um what do you

00:35:45.583-->00:35:50.917
guys do about uh finances? Do
you collect fees or do you take
donations >>Oh that’s a great

00:35:50.917-->00:35:54.750
question. >>for that or? >>Um
>>I’m not gonna answer it. >>Ya
I I can take that one off so um

00:35:54.750-->00:35:59.958
there’s a uh when we first
started we had a a company um
that was owned by a friend of

00:35:59.958-->00:36:08.250
mine and he actually uh I guess
sponsored to some extent and so
uh for some groups he would send

00:36:08.250-->00:36:15.500
money and basically buy food
like pizza and then beer if we
wanted it and then uh when we

00:36:15.500-->00:36:19.792
sort of moved it into a more
technical direction, you know
for like raspberry pi’s and

00:36:19.792-->00:36:24.375
things so that’s that’s always
an option. >>Um, we actually do
the opposite. We try and not to

00:36:24.375-->00:36:30.667
get money. We have to refuse it
from the the venue um so we’re
in the basement of a pub and

00:36:30.667-->00:36:37.000
Tuesday nights were a dead night
for them and now we bring over
100 people in once a month and

00:36:37.000-->00:36:44.250
those people drink and eat and
the normal um marvel if you’re
like a comedy club or something

00:36:44.250-->00:36:50.125
and you're in those venues, you
either charge at the door or you
take a a percentage of the take

00:36:50.125-->00:36:57.083
at the bar and so when we
started bringing in money on the
Tuesday night, the the the pub

00:36:57.083-->00:37:01.625
came to us and said okay so um
now you’ve reached the level we
should give you a percentage and

00:37:01.625-->00:37:08.750
we decided um that it would just
complicate things. we would then
have this pool of cash that we

00:37:08.750-->00:37:14.500
then have something to do with
so unless it was a very clear
what do we do with this money, I

00:37:14.500-->00:37:20.792
didn’t want to pollute the the
ethic of it being just a
free open thing uh with money so

00:37:20.792-->00:37:28.792
we just say no thanks but.
>>Thank you. >>Yes >>Actually
the the the the money from my

00:37:28.792-->00:37:33.458
Def Con group has come from my
company and uh the the the
resources I use for example the

00:37:33.458-->00:37:38.333
[inaudible] I use, come from my
team. So I convinced my [laughs]
leaders to to support me. I

00:37:38.333-->00:37:44.750
don’t think that the uh by like
taking money from company can
like uh pollute the the the the

00:37:44.750-->00:37:51.000
free environment because uh
aztec and steel like corporates
other with other companies. I

00:37:51.000-->00:37:55.125
invite them to to join us but uh
as long as you can get this down
and uh I think it’s it’s it’s

00:37:55.125-->00:38:01.792
good because uh the attendees
will if you want to come way
there's like no obstacles for

00:38:01.792-->00:38:08.917
them for them to come. I think
that’s a good thing. And the
company that does till now they

00:38:08.917-->00:38:14.958
didn’t they didn’t require
anything from me ha atleast.
Yes. >>We did bake sales. >>Oh.

00:38:14.958-->00:38:24.917
[Laughter] >>Alligator muffins.
>>Woooh! [Laughter] >>Uh so for
meeting twice a month how much

00:38:24.917-->00:38:29.083
work do you think would
typically be involved for
meeting twice a month for a Def

00:38:29.083-->00:38:36.042
Con group? >>Um I think it
depends on how uh for so if I
were to meet twice a month uh I

00:38:36.042-->00:38:43.542
would look at all different
options. So we have uh we
regularly have now that we built

00:38:43.542-->00:38:47.667
the um the retro pi’s we always
have like vintage games or
lockpicking for people that just

00:38:47.667-->00:38:51.125
want to come and hangout, of
we’ll just throw together
something uh like an older um

00:38:51.125-->00:38:58.000
older system and some wifi and
do some wifi hacking basics or
just put planning if you want to

00:38:58.000-->00:39:02.750
do a bigger project I think it
just depends on the maybe the
technical maturity of the group

00:39:02.750-->00:39:07.167
or the ones that be would be
attending on a regular basis so
I think that sort of depends on

00:39:07.167-->00:39:13.625
just the the atmosphere and
those who attend. >>Uh I did a
um uh uh 2 meeting uh 2 month

00:39:13.625-->00:39:18.250
meeting, uh 2 meetings a month
uh group and what we did was we
had the first meeting of the

00:39:18.250-->00:39:24.042
month was a social meeting.
There were no talks on hacking
or anything like that it was

00:39:24.042-->00:39:27.917
just people showing up and
actually interacting with each
other and having to talk and get

00:39:27.917-->00:39:31.583
to know what's going on and just
you know shoot the breeze and
actually in a nice social

00:39:31.583-->00:39:34.667
setting uh usually at a
restaurant or something.
Everybody would just get

00:39:34.667-->00:39:39.042
together and socialize and then
the second meeting of the month
would be the technical meeting

00:39:39.042-->00:39:42.708
where we would actually have
projects, we would have someone
giving a talk, or it’s like we

00:39:42.708-->00:39:47.417
would all do like a capture the
flag. it would be an actual
technical meeting so it’s like

00:39:47.417-->00:39:52.125
you have one social and then one
technical uh to sort of balance
it out. >>Ya. >>So those are two

00:39:52.125-->00:39:55.500
good options. >>I would I would
also give the advice that if you
are going to do 2 meetings a

00:39:55.500-->00:39:59.750
month that and actually this
goes for even if you’re just
going to have 1 meeting a month,

00:39:59.750-->00:40:04.458
like uh you can’t rely on just
one person to run everything
like if you have like 1 person

00:40:04.458-->00:40:10.875
that is the point of contact for
the meeting or the group or
whatever and and like they have

00:40:10.875-->00:40:18.125
to go on vacation or go on an
engagement for work or something
like that and it falls apart

00:40:18.125-->00:40:22.417
every time they’re not available
um that’s not good for the
group. So you have to have at

00:40:22.417-->00:40:27.292
like at least 2 if not more
members who are willing to say
like yeah we should get some

00:40:27.292-->00:40:32.833
talks together, I’ll talk to so
and so, that kind of thing. >>Ya
uh something that we to sort of

00:40:32.833-->00:40:38.167
prevent that too is we make sure
to let everyone in the group
know like hey there’s no like

00:40:38.167-->00:40:43.167
you know one you know single
power in this group, like this
is a group. So if you have an

00:40:43.167-->00:40:49.042
idea or a project you wanna do
just get it ready let us know if
we need to get supplies and just

00:40:49.042-->00:40:55.458
bring your idea or if you have a
talk just let us know and just
bring it. Uh that way it’s not

00:40:55.458-->00:41:00.667
like Grifter said it’s not
dependant on one person. >>Uh
would it be too hokey to do a

00:41:00.667-->00:41:06.667
quick 30, 45 second picture of
our group? >>What, what >>What?
>>Def Con 201. >>Where, where is

00:41:06.667-->00:41:10.667
201? >>North Jersey. >>North
Jersey? >>So do it? Okay. Uh ya
were Def Con 201 uh in NOrth

00:41:10.667-->00:41:17.583
Jersey about a 7 minute train
ride outside of New York City,
um sorta similar to some to what

00:41:17.583-->00:41:22.917
some of these guys were saying
we are a lucky hybrid mashup of
an already existing hacker

00:41:22.917-->00:41:27.833
space, and also the strong
infosec community in New York
city so we have a hole range of

00:41:27.833-->00:41:33.500
people from Nubes to people who
are Def Con OG’s and have spoken
several times. We do a lot of 3D

00:41:33.500-->00:41:38.042
printing and ticker typical
hackerspace stuff. But we're
also trying to set up some CTF

00:41:38.042-->00:41:43.708
servers and we always have uh
infosec talks. Um we meet every
third Friday and we have pretty

00:41:43.708-->00:41:48.708
consistently for the past 6
months and we just had our first
month with a second meeting and

00:41:48.708-->00:41:52.125
it was like you said, uh we
redesigned the website. I’m
actually trying to get the IT

00:41:52.125-->00:41:58.458
guy, this is admin guy to uh
deploy that while uh I’m here
now um but if anyone is in the

00:41:58.458-->00:42:02.958
New York City oh we we we get
members coming in from very far
too even though there’s a robust

00:42:02.958-->00:42:08.125
community there uh all the way
from Long Island some people we
have one dude who actually comes

00:42:08.125-->00:42:13.375
in from Philly uh if anybody’s
in that area, in the New York
city or North Jersey area raise

00:42:13.375-->00:42:19.458
your hand or let me know I”ll
give you the info. >>Um
[inaudible words] >>Now you’re a

00:42:19.458-->00:42:25.208
Def Con speaker. [Laughter]
[Applause] >>Congratulations.
[Applause] Um, [inaudible word]

00:42:25.208-->00:42:31.875
>>Do you guys have any um tips
and suggestions for when you’re
in more of a rural area uh we

00:42:31.875-->00:42:37.250
have a very small 2600 group and
you’ve mentioned that you kinda
split off from 2600 groups but

00:42:37.250-->00:42:43.167
do you also kind of encourage
collaboration with or maybe even
overlapping with? >>Ya

00:42:43.167-->00:42:47.083
definitely incorp collaboration
there like I said there’s no
competition and and also the

00:42:47.083-->00:42:52.417
other thing is like one of the
things you can do uh if you got
uh uh a rural Def Con group is

00:42:52.417-->00:42:58.625
making sure that you're doing uh
a chat system. It’s like uh
doing a Slack Channel or uh

00:42:58.625-->00:43:02.000
having some kind of interaction
on the forums or like facebook
profile where you can like take

00:43:02.000-->00:43:06.458
pictures and share message and
actually maybe invite speakers
to skype in from other

00:43:06.458-->00:43:10.542
locations. It’s like reach out
to different speakers and
different people and say hey can

00:43:10.542-->00:43:15.000
you skype in and and do a
meeting for us? >>Ya and I think
also um so if something for for

00:43:15.000-->00:43:20.250
Utah, one of the things that we
do because there are so many
other organizations, we have

00:43:20.250-->00:43:26.042
like this umbrella organization,
we call it Utah Sec so like I am
the point of contact through

00:43:26.042-->00:43:31.417
DC801 for Utah Sec and then
there’s like infragard and the
snort user group and like so

00:43:31.417-->00:43:34.708
every meeting like saint con
they all have someone who
represents them um and get

00:43:34.708-->00:43:40.208
together and kind of talk about
like oh hey you were gonna do a
talk this month, this way like

00:43:40.208-->00:43:44.792
the content that gets shared at
those meetings normally only
once can get spread among a

00:43:44.792-->00:43:48.875
larger group and usually that
means some cross pollination as
well so if you wanna get

00:43:48.875-->00:43:53.333
additional members I’d encourage
like going to some of the other
meetings like I Sock or ISSA

00:43:53.333-->00:43:57.917
meetings and things like that
that are in the area and then
being like we wanna do a Def Con

00:43:57.917-->00:44:02.708
group. >>Well the thing is is
our our area is so rural that we
don’t have much of a tech field

00:44:02.708-->00:44:06.667
but we we know they’re hiding in
the woodworks and we’re trying
to drag them out through having

00:44:06.667-->00:44:11.125
a 2600 and or a Def Con group.
>>Mmm >>Smoke em out. >>That’s
what we’re trying to do. So, ya

00:44:11.125-->00:44:15.458
if you have any tips on on
bringing those people out of the
woodwork in such a rural area

00:44:15.458-->00:44:20.000
that doesn’t normally have
technology in the forefront,
that’s very helpful. >>And you

00:44:20.000-->00:44:24.375
don’t always have to do like
high like technical things at
the gr at the meet up too it

00:44:24.375-->00:44:27.417
could just be like Jayson said
the one that they did it it was
just hanging out getting to know

00:44:27.417-->00:44:32.458
you know like minded people or
even uh you know teaching
lockpicking or you know vintage

00:44:32.458-->00:44:36.667
video games or something just to
start building that community,
and then from there somebody

00:44:36.667-->00:44:40.708
might have an idea or something
for a project so. >>That’s
great. Thank you very much.

00:44:40.708-->00:44:44.917
>>Sure Thank you. >>And just one
quick second I want to remind
everybody about the DCG mixer.

00:44:44.917-->00:44:49.917

00:45:17.750-->00:45:22.708
>>Ya so from here so come come
hangout with us and uh have some
free drinks and whatever. >>So

00:45:22.708-->00:45:28.625
yes >>uh Okie dokie so uh mocal
Def Con chapter has been around
for quite a while but

00:45:28.625-->00:45:33.833
unfortunately activity oin us
has been kinda slow because uh
our past uh let’s say let’s say

00:45:33.833-->00:45:39.500
uh council has had to take off
due to family and other
professional or or uh

00:45:39.500-->00:45:42.542
obligations decided to leave and
we’re trying to jump start it
back up at the moment but I was

00:45:42.542-->00:45:47.625
just kinda curious as to how you
would if you got if you all had
any uh no not just a panel but

00:45:47.625-->00:45:52.333
anyone else has also had like uh
scheduling conflict issues, when
you’re trying to get the group

00:45:52.333-->00:45:56.875
but not but not everyone’s able
to participate due to like needs
being needs that go beyond it.

00:45:56.875-->00:46:02.417
>>JUst you gotta, oh man
microphone You just gotta you
gotta >>It’s truly important to

00:46:02.417-->00:46:06.875
have a regular um date, you just
have to pick one and stick with
it. I mean we meet the last

00:46:06.875-->00:46:10.708
Tuesday of the month >>Ya you
gotta pick something >>and
that’s not right for everyone

00:46:10.708-->00:46:15.083
but nothing’s going to be right
for everyone so. >>Exactly. As
as long as it’s consistent. If

00:46:15.083-->00:46:18.875
you move it around then you’ll
just lose people all the time
and then the numbers dwindle.

00:46:18.875-->00:46:23.417
Like just say like okay it’s
going to be this day every month
and leave it there. >>CAuse

00:46:23.417-->00:46:28.458
people will start planning for
it then. So the other thing is
make sure you announce. We find

00:46:28.458-->00:46:35.875
um we we like everyone we’re
busy, lazy, useless and uh
[laughter] if the the months

00:46:35.875-->00:46:41.333
where we announce at least a
week in advance, we get a much
bigger attendance and there’s

00:46:41.333-->00:46:48.167
even regulars just forget okay
always oh it’s that Tuesday
again d****t. I would’ve come

00:46:48.167-->00:46:51.750
but I arranged this other thing
and did things so um if we had
announced a week earlier and

00:46:51.750-->00:46:56.292
reminded them they would've kept
the time free um so you know
give good information and be

00:46:56.292-->00:47:03.750
consistent. >>Heck yeah thank
you very much. [coughing] >>Yes?
>>Hi just to comment back on

00:47:03.750-->00:47:09.208
your internet safety uh IAC
Squared has a safe and secure
online. Uh There’s like 2 tracks

00:47:09.208-->00:47:13.125
for like elementary middle
school, there’s also another one
for seniors. Vetting you know

00:47:13.125-->00:47:18.583
work with the teachers, and I
mean they’ve got a format made
where you can take advantage of

00:47:18.583-->00:47:20.750
[inaudible words] >>We wouldn’t
mind taking a look at it ya it’s
like we don’t want it to be

00:47:20.750-->00:47:24.917
corporate you know because IAC
squared but uh we we’d want to
do that little hacker edge to it

00:47:24.917-->00:47:28.375
but ya that’s actually a good
resource to we’ll steal from I
mean borrow I mean uh uh look

00:47:28.375-->00:47:32.292
at. [Laughs] >>We’re not
competing. >>Cool. >>Thank you.
>>Thank you. >>Thank you. >>So I

00:47:32.292-->00:47:38.250
was wondering when setting woah,
when I’m setting up a space for
this and working it out, when

00:47:38.250-->00:47:42.042
you get the especially the
teenage kids, maybe younger
kids, how do you even you know

00:47:42.042-->00:47:46.792
cover yourself if they go do
something nefarious? >>Um
>>Unfortunately you know I don’t

00:47:46.792-->00:47:49.625
think you can control everybody
so >>Just >>No I mean we we
don’t >>Just don’t attack any of

00:47:49.625-->00:47:54.417
them and then it’s pretty solid.
>>You just always remind em it’s
like Law enforcement as is is

00:47:54.417-->00:48:01.542
invited and welcomed to these
meetings as anybody else so uh
don’t do shady stuff at the

00:48:01.542-->00:48:05.667
meetings. [Laughs] It’s like.
>>[inaudible talking] >>But you
know if like myself or a few

00:48:05.667-->00:48:09.292
others you know if I’m in charge
of it they have a tendency to
come after those people if they

00:48:09.292-->00:48:13.625
do something bad so. >>don't
have one person in charge.
>>Okay >>Yeah >>Okay. >>Yeah

00:48:13.625-->00:48:21.042
>>Thank you >>Hi um I’m pow from
uh DC 170 from >>HI Pow! >>Hi!
[Laughter] >>We are the I think

00:48:21.042-->00:48:30.417

Spain we are based in Barcelona

00:48:30.417-->00:48:36.917
every year we host a security
conference uh we made it the
people uh for our Def Con group

00:48:36.917-->00:48:42.750
and uh I want to officially
invite the all all of the other
Def Con groups to attend to this

00:48:42.750-->00:48:49.542
conference cause I think it will
be a it will be cool like to

00:48:49.542-->00:48:54.000
Con groups and make a community
there in Spain. In Spain uh

guys uh thank you for sticking
out uh hopefully [applause] you

00:49:26.208-->00:49:29.875
go to the mixer and we’ll wait
for one per question right here.
Yes? [applause] Oops. [laughs]

00:49:29.875-->00:49:38.417
>>Okay >>You snuck up on me.
>>Um uh just one question um uh
I intend to create a group for a

00:49:38.417-->00:49:44.458
region rather than one country,
>>Right. >>So um apparently you
use the area code or my country

00:49:44.458-->00:49:53.500
code for this >>Right. >>So how
would I do that? >>Uh what’s the
region? Uh oh you uh the

00:49:53.500-->00:49:56.542
question was he wants to start a
Def Con group for a region so
like several countries not just

00:49:56.542-->00:50:04.333
one country. Uh What region is
it? >>Uh I was gonna suggest Def
Con GCC. Which is Gulf

00:50:04.333-->00:50:12.750
Cooperation Council. >>Okay um
that is interesting um the we
will have to take that one

00:50:12.750-->00:50:16.208
>>That’s a thinker >>offline and
look at it >>That’s a thinker
>>because uh I don’t have an

00:50:16.208-->00:50:21.292
answer uh and I’m just gonna
hymn and hall a little bit until
ya >>Give you a little bit of

00:50:21.292-->00:50:26.958
background um I don't I don’t
remember when I started
attending this Def Con whether

00:50:26.958-->00:50:33.458
it was the second one or third
one, um I stopped in 2011 then I
came back now um it’s much

00:50:33.458-->00:50:41.500
better than what uh I was uh
expecting. >>Oh very cool. >>Uh
uh I’m the ex german of coit IT

00:50:41.500-->00:50:48.167
Society my back on this can be
dealt uh so I’ve done a lot but
uh why I’m doing for the region

00:50:48.167-->00:50:57.417
because I believe that um not
having one group uh is much
better than having uh multiple

00:50:57.417-->00:51:01.417
groups. >>Well it it depends
it’s like we’ll definitely go
offline like cause it’s like it

00:51:01.417-->00:51:05.958
all depends. it’s like i would
suggest like having it like mult
having each one for each country

00:51:05.958-->00:51:10.375
it’s like re and then just
having a group meeting in the
different regions but we’ll talk

00:51:10.375-->00:51:15.625
about that offline. >>Eventually
the entire region will be one.
>>Ya okay. Well thank you very

00:51:15.625-->00:51:21.000
much. It's like uh once again
guys thanks for sticking it out,
really appreciate it [applause]

00:51:21.000-->00:00:00.000
and [applause].
