00:00:00.000-->00:00:06.292
>>So good afternoon it’s really
great to you know meet you- meet
you awesome people and to share

00:00:06.292-->00:00:13.083
my work here and uh my name’s
Haoqui Shan and I’m a wireless
and uh I’m a wireless hardware

00:00:13.083-->00:00:18.208
security researcher in uh in the
team UnicornTeam and uh Qihoo
360 so which we’re located in

00:00:18.208-->00:00:26.417
China and uh initially I had a
colleague I’m sorry one moment.
Initially I have a co- I have a

00:00:26.417-->00:00:32.667
colleague uh to you know give
presentations with me but he had
an issue with his visa so he

00:00:32.667-->00:00:39.958
can’t make it really sorry about
that. Uh so now I need to stand
here alone and make this

00:00:39.958-->00:00:44.542
presentation. So it’s my third
time to give presentation here
and share my team’s work and uh

00:00:44.542-->00:00:52.792
I hope someon- some of you can
re- will remember me and just
don’t blame me for my poor

00:00:52.792-->00:01:06.333
accent and poor explanation uh
so uh I re- I’m sorry, yeah I
will explain and demo situate

00:01:06.333-->00:01:15.125
the uh demo situate you guys how
to build a NFC tool from scratch
so uh in the end maybe some of

00:01:15.125-->00:01:22.792
you can get a skills and steal
some with money from his credit
card please don’t- please don’t

00:01:22.792-->00:01:29.375
tell anybody you learned it from
here alright? Yeah [laughter] So
let’s just a step to the topic

00:01:29.375-->00:01:39.750
so here’s agenda of this
presentation and uh I just draw
a simple uh simple diagram so I

00:01:39.750-->00:01:46.542
will introduce my great team and
uh lead you guys back to the old
time when we trying to hack

00:01:46.542-->00:01:54.042
something some- some- eh- NFC
cards, or some- something with
RFID so uh that’s- and to get

00:01:54.042-->00:02:02.417
back to the old fashioned but
powerful hacking tools we used
to use okay? And uh uh then the

00:02:02.417-->00:02:12.250
details of the newest RFID
hacking tools which is my tool
uniproxy will be introduced uh

00:02:12.250-->00:02:20.750
so two demos will be showed by
the video and uh uh I hope this
one will work okay? So the

00:02:20.750-->00:02:27.458
presentation is about how to
build uh too so I will focus on
the- more of the idea and still

00:02:27.458-->00:02:35.625
on some hacking skills and uh
hopefully won’t let you guys
disappointment so uh so by the

00:02:35.625-->00:02:42.292
way this is the last- la- tr-
last presentation of the day I
think so uh I will try this fast

00:02:42.292-->00:02:50.250
and fun and uh I hope to won’t
delay you guys I don’t know from
this trip and uh So here is the

00:02:50.250-->00:02:55.417
first demo of my hacking tool
and I will let you guys have a
simple impression of the

00:02:55.417-->00:03:09.000
uniproxy. So let’s just okay
this won’t work oh so I will
stop it in a moment and to give

00:03:09.000-->00:03:19.667
you explanation okay? So you can
see on the table there are uh is
this yeah oh there’s this ones

00:03:19.667-->00:03:27.333
uh so there are two hardware
which uh you- you know is
uniproxy and uh one cell phone

00:03:27.333-->00:03:33.083
to get notification, and one
pos- POS machine and one credit
card with tip- with chip and pin

00:03:33.083-->00:03:44.125
so now we just turn our hardware
on and uh turn our POS machine
on and uh choose how ma- how

00:03:44.125-->00:03:52.542
much money you want to spend so
you can see we place one credit
card just near the uh uniproxy

00:03:52.542-->00:04:00.167
maste- master part and now we
just uh get the POS machine near
to our uniproxy slave part. So

00:04:00.167-->00:04:14.125
you can just uh tap it and then
now just one moment he’s
processing it. Now you’ve got a

00:04:14.125-->00:04:20.125
receipt so you don’t need to you
know uh t- so- in this way you
can just uh steal someone’s

00:04:20.125-->00:04:24.458
money with uh you know just uh
tap his credit card and uh- if
you want to steal someone’s

00:04:24.458-->00:04:29.833
money you know some credit card
with chip and pin and then you
just tap somewhere without

00:04:29.833-->00:04:37.167
password to present a pin with
right so but if you want to try
to steal money you don’t h-

00:04:37.167-->00:04:40.833
apparently you can’t just hold a
giant POS machine to steal his
money out or he will just call

00:04:40.833-->00:04:46.583
the cops right? So now you can
just with a simple card to get
around of him and just tap it

00:04:46.583-->00:04:54.500
now you can get the uh get money
and uh maybe someone just want
to ask um is there any security

00:04:54.500-->00:04:59.875
protocol using his credit card
and how did you just you know
use some- some- some other

00:04:59.875-->00:05:15.208
people’s uh credit card and use
it to pay and uh yeah. So here
is the uh so that’s the uni-

00:05:15.208-->00:05:28.333
uniproxy to we just built um so
uh I just want to introduce the
team o- team of uh I just want

00:05:28.333-->00:05:34.583
to introduce my team and uh you
should just know our name’s
Unicorn team and uh we are a

00:05:34.583-->00:05:40.750
secu- internal security team
researching team of Qihoo 360
and we also founded in 2014 so

00:05:40.750-->00:05:47.750
we focus on the wireless
hardware harckin- hacking and
defensing and uh we do a lot of

00:05:47.750-->00:05:52.417
security research and hardware
development and also the
pentest- to- uh w- and also the

00:05:52.417-->00:06:01.833
pentest. So we do have a serial
uh wireless research uh
published in the Def Con and the

00:06:01.833-->00:06:08.750
Black Hat and uh maybe some of
you heard it before so it’s
about the low-cost GPS spoofing

00:06:08.750-->00:06:18.000
and which presented in 3 years
ago and uh also LTE redirection
attack and which we present in

00:06:18.000-->00:06:25.625
here and last year so uh and
also we do have a power
communication attack on the Def

00:06:25.625-->00:06:31.875
Con last year and uh this year I
don’t know have you guys heard
it uh it’s about the ghost

00:06:31.875-->00:06:41.083
telephonist uh which you- we can
just like hijack and uh spoof
your your call your SMS even you

00:06:41.083-->00:06:49.458
are on the 4G LTE network so so
that’s I think that’s a little
bit cool and uh we also have

00:06:49.458-->00:06:56.292
some hardware developed and so
uh we do have a lot of hacking
tools and uh we do have the

00:06:56.292-->00:07:04.667
HackID uh but most of folks are
on the RFID okay just some
HackID, HackID Pro and etcetera

00:07:04.667-->00:07:15.542
so you can see all the details
in our- I’m sorry yeah in our
website. So let’s just uh I

00:07:15.542-->00:07:22.208
believe you guys are not
inexperienced in the near field
communication uh hacking cause

00:07:22.208-->00:07:28.708
it’s wildly used in our life,
right? So uh you’re credit card,
your ID card, and your security

00:07:28.708-->00:07:37.083
card and uh it’s- it’s- it’s
really inside uh around all of
us so the NFC card don’t need

00:07:37.083-->00:07:43.708
power uh itself and it take the
power of the reader so uh there
are many protocols so you will

00:07:43.708-->00:07:55.917
see of the cards uh such as
ISO14443 and uh ISO1566- uh 67
uh 3 and etcetera but now we

00:07:55.917-->00:08:04.042
only focus on our- our two on
the ISO14443 okay? And uh uh
just for example so this

00:08:04.042-->00:08:13.042
protocol is basically most
popular protocol in NFC cards uh
it supports many application so

00:08:13.042-->00:08:18.917
in- so in China the security
card, the the your passport and
uh your bank card- your bank

00:08:18.917-->00:08:27.125
card all based on this protocol
so uh uh it’s the widely used
these two a lot of taking

00:08:27.125-->00:08:36.333
measures you know even on the
NFC card and the also I do that
too. So here is where we aiming

00:08:36.333-->00:08:45.125
uh why do we want to hack an NFC
card so as we mentioned before
we are hackers and of course we

00:08:45.125-->00:08:51.625
want to fake someone’s security
card to enter some forbidden
area and also some people might

00:08:51.625-->00:08:58.625
want to- want to use other
people’s credit card just like
me uh yeah instead of mine yeah

00:08:58.625-->00:09:05.417
which I highly recommend you
don’t do that [chuckles] for me
that’s- that’s- that is there is

00:09:05.417-->00:09:13.583
another story okay? [laughter]
Uh my- the- my company has uh my
company is a huge company in

00:09:13.583-->00:09:20.208
China so I had to situate a ruse
to make sure uh the card- the
the staff- the col- my college-

00:09:20.208-->00:09:27.500
uh my colleagues will you know
to work and off work in time so
everybody in my company has a

00:09:27.500-->00:09:33.417
unique security card and the the
security system will log the
time when you enter every days

00:09:33.417-->00:09:40.583
uh when you enter every room.
And uh so that your boss will
easily know you are late or not

00:09:40.583-->00:09:47.792
and uh so I was thinking maybe I
can uh so- and also if you are
late for work and your salary

00:09:47.792-->00:09:54.042
will lose alright. Yeah. So I
was thinking maybe I can- I
could build a tool uh to fake my

00:09:54.042-->00:10:03.375
ID card and to place it near
some you know uh security code
doors and with a reader so I

00:10:03.375-->00:10:10.042
don’t have to get up early every
day yeah [laughter] but but it
is but but the company is a

00:10:10.042-->00:10:14.917
security company and actually
the security system is developed
by my team [laughter] yeah

00:10:14.917-->00:10:24.958
[laughs] so this is awkward yeah
so we use the HID card and uh
apparently as our ID card so I

00:10:24.958-->00:10:32.417
don’t know any easy way to fake
you- HID card so cause we can
break the security protocol it’s

00:10:32.417-->00:10:37.000
really hard so that was just us
thinking maybe I can just build
a proxy tool to transfer the

00:10:37.000-->00:10:44.958
signal from the- between the
reader and the card so that just
let the near tens far away so I

00:10:44.958-->00:10:51.458
can I can spoof that. So I was-
I was thinking I can use the
same way on the credit card and

00:10:51.458-->00:10:58.667
with you know the chip and pins
so you- you guys can do the you
guys do have the chip and pins

00:10:58.667-->00:11:03.458
cards right? You can just buy
something and uh just to tap
somewhere and without password

00:11:03.458-->00:11:09.542
so you uh it also best on the
[inaudible] attack so we are
able to just hijack it so I’m

00:11:09.542-->00:11:21.833
sorry forgot to- to- So the way
we just use to hack is to have
uh just like to have a quick

00:11:21.833-->00:11:28.417
review what we used to do okay?
To- we used to use a proxmark
III and we use it to uh

00:11:28.417-->00:11:37.042
Chameleonmini and this is- the
proxmark III is the best RFID
hacking tool I used to use uh

00:11:37.042-->00:11:44.750
yeah we- I also use it uh
ChameleonMini and uh this- this
tool are focused on the protocol

00:11:44.750-->00:11:51.000
so with the proxmark III you can
just hack a high frequency and
low frequency in both ways so

00:11:51.000-->00:11:58.958
you- it’s very powerful but uh
with another one it’s just
focused on the ISO14443 uh and

00:11:58.958-->00:12:06.208
uh you can just uh you can just
uh clone a card if you can crack
it but uh most mostly folks on

00:12:06.208-->00:12:13.375
the Mifare classic 1k or Mifare
classic 4k so there’s also
another way just like us is a

00:12:13.375-->00:12:21.208
proxy tool they uh I think they
are the data so it’s app,
Android app and so you can

00:12:21.208-->00:12:27.042
Google it, uh you can Google it,
download it, and then trust it
uh and try it so it’s name’s

00:12:27.042-->00:12:34.250
NFCProxy and NFCGate but uh I
use them they are not however
maybe not fit in China’s

00:12:34.250-->00:12:41.667
environment but that’s okay the-
this uh those tools are just
inspired me how to build a proxy

00:12:41.667-->00:12:51.083
tool and uh so why not- why not
we use a Proxmark III? So it is
simple even though it’s supports

00:12:51.083-->00:12:57.458
many protocols and it’s powerful
but it can’t hack a credit card
at all I guess we got- we got us

00:12:57.458-->00:13:04.083
all rich now yeah so and why
don’t we use the NFCGate or
NFCProxy? Uh it’s based on

00:13:04.083-->00:13:11.625
Android and uh it’s uh it can
be- it used modified firmware to
relay your NFC data and Uh it

00:13:11.625-->00:13:18.375
can monitor transmitted data and
uh uh but it relies on the WI-Fi
so the delay on the wi-fi

00:13:18.375-->00:13:24.792
network is really huge and it
can’t be tolerable. But too much
delays to complete the- the

00:13:24.792-->00:13:34.458
whole payment procedure and uh
that’s why I didn’t use it. So
let’s just say I built another

00:13:34.458-->00:13:39.958
wheel so why do- why do I need
this tool as I just mentioned
before I want to- I want to

00:13:39.958-->00:13:46.042
sleep awhile and I want to you
know earn money and uh I’m
inspired by the mentioned

00:13:46.042-->00:13:53.250
brilliant hacking tools and but
I want to make it faster so I
was thinking uh my team can

00:13:53.250-->00:13:58.250
build a lot of hardware so let’s
just focus on the pure hardware
solution um and also uh this

00:13:58.250-->00:14:08.417
tool is completely self designed
and modified so everything we
can need is just produced by us

00:14:08.417-->00:14:15.042
so we don’t need to rely on
reading some other source or uh
to protect another hardware

00:14:15.042-->00:14:22.750
design we’ll just build our own.
So I just want to uh introduce
what is UniProxy. So I believe

00:14:22.750-->00:14:32.917
you guys have a clear view now
uh it’s a PN74 uh 6- 62AU based
NFC proto- uh proxy tool so it’s

00:14:32.917-->00:14:43.417
a chipset which manufactured by
the AXP. Uh currently this
device is only support ISO14443A

00:14:43.417-->00:14:49.667
protocol now but it can easily
to you know to exten- tend it
for some other protocols as uh-

00:14:49.667-->00:14:54.125
as long as the chipset supports
uh so now the device are
targeting the QuickPass credit

00:14:54.125-->00:15:00.875
card so I don’t know if- uh if
you guys uh the AMerican Quick
version QuickPass name may be

00:15:00.875-->00:15:06.792
EMV or Visa Pay but it’s similar
uh so the UniProxy contains two
parts, the- the- the reader

00:15:06.792-->00:15:14.750
emulator and a ca- card emulator
which I call them the master one
and the slave one. So the

00:15:14.750-->00:15:21.792
payment transmit information
will be transferred between the
master and the slave uh where

00:15:21.792-->00:15:30.292
the 24L01 chipset which means
it’s point to point wireless
data transmission so as I just

00:15:30.292-->00:15:41.750
mentioned it’s easily to ex- uh
adapt it to ISO14443B and uh
15693 standard NFC card so it’s-

00:15:41.750-->00:15:47.583
it’s another protocol but uh as
you know it’s opened and uh you
can just handle the chipset

00:15:47.583-->00:15:56.500
process so you can modify by
yourself. So here is the core of
UniProxy uh we use PN chipsets

00:15:56.500-->00:16:02.958
as a core so it’s in- uh as I
mentioned it’s an NXP chip and
support for Mifare family of

00:16:02.958-->00:16:10.583
cards it’s it can read, it can
write, and emulate a card, and
quite a powerful. And it’s

00:16:10.583-->00:16:19.167
really real cheap used I- I
think because uh the- this is a
cause when our- when I tried to

00:16:19.167-->00:16:25.250
find some document it’s not
easily to- it’s not easily to
Google it so then it should say

00:16:25.250-->00:16:31.458
we didn’t buy the survey- Sevice
uh service of NXP so we don’t
have any official spo- support.

00:16:31.458-->00:16:39.625
So but we are hackers right so
the the architecture of UniProxy
is as I said on the screen,

00:16:39.625-->00:16:46.500
there’s another one, it’s simple
and we use uh a simple
electronic circuit design which

00:16:46.500-->00:16:53.625
uh slide modified by the NXP
official recommendation so don’t
worry about the hardware designs

00:16:53.625-->00:17:00.333
it’s not a big deal not a big
issue so it’s chipset is highly
integrated and very powerful

00:17:00.333-->00:17:08.250
this is uh also the reason we
choose this one. So this is the
front face of our UniProxy tool.

00:17:08.250-->00:17:17.500
So you can see the NFC antenna
uh here- I’m sorry, yeah. So
this is uh- this is antenna so

00:17:17.500-->00:17:26.333
sorry about that I use a pen on
my ipad to- to mark this cause
I’m not good at the powerpoint

00:17:26.333-->00:17:36.333
so this is the antenna with the
team logo on it and uh in the
left corner uh let’s see where

00:17:36.333-->00:17:41.167
is it, where is oh! Here the
left corner uh you can see the
power supplies occurred and uh

00:17:41.167-->00:17:46.292
this too is powered by lithium
batteries so just so it’s also
chargeable so you can take this

00:17:46.292-->00:17:52.958
outside uh and do something evil
and uh without any notice so in
the right side it’s you can see

00:17:52.958-->00:18:00.667
the uh see the 24L01 chipse-
chip model we use- we use this
chipset to communicate between

00:18:00.667-->00:18:09.917
the master and slave so I don’t
know if you guys see the core
chip it’s right on here uh yeah

00:18:09.917-->00:18:17.833
it’s a little bit dark it’s an
xp chip on the end of the arrow
mmm it’s a little bit dark so

00:18:17.833-->00:18:23.750
you can’t see the hardware of
this hacking tool is quite
simple it’s uh isn’t complicat-

00:18:23.750-->00:18:29.583
uh it’s not complica- uh
complicated at all so we see
official recommendation of

00:18:29.583-->00:18:39.167
everybody can draw their uh
where’s the mouse? Oh there it
is so with o- official

00:18:39.167-->00:18:45.542
recommendation everybody can
draw and map their own device
and uh build assemble one but uh

00:18:45.542-->00:18:53.500
um it’s quite easy so don’t
don’t fret so this is the back
side of the master part you can

00:18:53.500-->00:19:00.458
see there’s nothing arrows just
antenna just a battery and uh
after the hardware design I’d

00:19:00.458-->00:19:08.500
like to introduce the software
design here uh so let’s step to
the software processing of the-

00:19:08.500-->00:19:13.667
this hacking tool so actually my
opinion so actually in my
opinion I really want to- I

00:19:13.667-->00:19:16.792
really believe the source code
can explain any- everything
right? So when I got to make

00:19:16.792-->00:19:20.625
this presentation I thought
let’s just make this open
sourced and uh voila we can just

00:19:20.625-->00:19:27.458
I can just play around so but as
I- as you see it’s a big company
and it’s- my not my own work so

00:19:27.458-->00:19:34.500
uh it’s part of company property
and uh that’s why I need to
stand here and uh only to

00:19:34.500-->00:19:41.250
present a few source codes
screen shots and uh then
[inaudible] So just back to the

00:19:41.250-->00:19:49.833
topic. So firstly you need to uh
you need to uh you need to read
a library API and uh uh where-

00:19:49.833-->00:19:56.625
and there will be a loop to put
our chip and the sniffer-
sniffering moto and it will

00:19:56.625-->00:20:04.833
detect any RF-field to- with a
protocol we want- we are aiming
and around uh if it is the code

00:20:04.833-->00:20:13.833
we’re just go to the handshake
stuff. So in our master part as
you know uh re emulator will try

00:20:13.833-->00:20:19.708
to run the handshake and uh a
handshake routine with the- with
the card which just falls the RF

00:20:19.708-->00:20:26.167
run of it and after the
handshake our master card will
get the parameters of the card

00:20:26.167-->00:20:34.208
and set a timeout. So then it’ll
be able to pack and transfer all
the raw data- uh raw data to the

00:20:34.208-->00:20:41.250
card emulator immediately than
the uh the master will just wait
to receive the data which comes

00:20:41.250-->00:20:46.833
back from the slave and uh
before its timed out. So if
everything okay the whole

00:20:46.833-->00:20:54.750
routine will just start the
block transmission. So you can
just uh download the- uh the-

00:20:54.750-->00:21:04.833
the- pd- the pdf and you can see
the uh source code detail. So
this is a block transmit- uh

00:21:04.833-->00:21:10.458
transmission routine and also
the last routine of the- uh of
the master part so when it’s

00:21:10.458-->00:21:16.125
start to transmit I- transmit
block data and uh it will just
wait a response from the card

00:21:16.125-->00:21:23.375
emulator before before it’s time
out and then just forward and
spreads data uh to the to the

00:21:23.375-->00:21:31.417
real card so and uh through- uh
yeah. And the waited response of
the real card. So if there is

00:21:31.417-->00:21:37.917
something wrong with the real
card and they didn’t get a
response before timeout the

00:21:37.917-->00:21:46.167
master will notify the slave and
the communication is ended. Or
our- com- uh or our emulator

00:21:46.167-->00:21:51.583
will just get i-block. The
I-block data uh is real data so
you can just process it and you

00:21:51.583-->00:21:57.458
can directly responds to a
reoccur so it don’t need to pack
the- you don’t need to pack the

00:21:57.458-->00:22:06.292
data you don’t need to transfer
the data so uh it will directly
to- uh respond uh when it’s

00:22:06.292-->00:22:11.792
finished the directory response
is in our case the direct uh the
data will direct forward to the

00:22:11.792-->00:22:17.875
card emulator so that’s from our
loop so until the- until the
whole procedure is ended. So

00:22:17.875-->00:22:25.958
this is the front of our slave
part of our hacking tools so now
you can notice the hardware is

00:22:25.958-->00:22:32.250
almost- is exactly the same so
you nee- you do- you can build
one and one for master one for

00:22:32.250-->00:22:37.750
slave you don’t need to- you
know to- to build a different
different part they are same

00:22:37.750-->00:22:45.583
hardware design but software is
the most different. So the
process of our slave part is

00:22:45.583-->00:22:52.583
just uh you know just uh
corresponds- corresponded to the
master one uh we can call it

00:22:52.583-->00:22:58.833
master and slave right? So after
the start up of the hardware the
program will just init the card

00:22:58.833-->00:23:08.417
emulate function and try to
receive the ISO14443A parameters
and uh from the 27 yeah from

00:23:08.417-->00:23:14.083
the- from the UR- as we
described it before it’s coming
from our read emulator so once

00:23:14.083-->00:23:19.458
it gets the parameters and does
the slave one we just send a
successful- uh success command

00:23:19.458-->00:23:26.167
response and back to the master-
master part and notified it. So
here is the second part of the

00:23:26.167-->00:23:32.833
slave uh slave software design.
The slave will start integration
with the read emulator and the

00:23:32.833-->00:23:40.958
init the card emulator so what
you received the the uh uh we
we’ve received the parameters so

00:23:40.958-->00:23:47.917
if there is a real card reader
nearby so the slave part uh
which also you know is our card

00:23:47.917-->00:23:52.375
emulator will start the
communication between the real
card and will receive the

00:23:52.375-->00:23:58.875
parameters. So then it will act
like a card- uh a real- a real-
car- a real card to make

00:23:58.875-->00:24:04.875
handshake with a real card a
real reader so then the
corresponding to our uh master

00:24:04.875-->00:24:11.208
part start the block
transmission. So the- the card
emulation is just uh more

00:24:11.208-->00:24:20.167
complicated than the card
emulator to the software design
uh so after the start of the

00:24:20.167-->00:24:25.667
block transmission uh the card
emulator will receive data from
a real one so if the data is not

00:24:25.667-->00:24:31.917
I-block data the- the slave will
detect that if it is deselect
command and if it is just

00:24:31.917-->00:24:39.792
forward to the reader emulator
and the uh send this command to
a real- real reader. So this

00:24:39.792-->00:24:49.958
process will just save time. So
if there is a S-Block instead uh
car- bu- uh instead of R-Block

00:24:49.958-->00:24:55.333
data uh so the com- card
emulator will just process it by
itself. So back to the upper

00:24:55.333-->00:25:01.125
level mmm a card emulator will
just forward the data to a car-
uh to a card emulator and send

00:25:01.125-->00:25:08.875
it delay command to the half
time waiting and this is action
we’ll also level to the success

00:25:08.875-->00:25:17.083
rate cause uh it’s uh a success-
a re- uh a rate of every
efficiency cause there will be

00:25:17.083-->00:25:24.208
always be some unexpected delays
so then the slave and the uh so
then the slave part will receive

00:25:24.208-->00:25:31.667
data from reader emulator and
then forwarded to a real reader
and all the actions would uh

00:25:31.667-->00:25:38.583
would form a loop and uh will
cooperate with a reader and uh
read emulator and finally finish

00:25:38.583-->00:25:45.792
the whole transmission. So in
the end of- in the end you can
just uh uh uh complete uh

00:25:45.792-->00:25:54.417
[inaudible] transmission
procedure so the principal I
just described is very simple

00:25:54.417-->00:26:00.542
but uh I will let you know- I
would like you to know there was
a lot of issues that occurred in

00:26:00.542-->00:26:06.333
the development so I would like
you to- to you know the
impression that you have when

00:26:06.333-->00:26:11.792
you start in the- you know if
you want to make new proxy tool.
Okay so first the chipment- the

00:26:11.792-->00:26:19.625
chip set we just used can’t -
can not change the first byte of
UID so uh it’s it’s burned in

00:26:19.625-->00:26:24.958
the firmware so it can’t change
the UI- uh the first byte of UID
of your chipset so it’s uh it

00:26:24.958-->00:26:34.875
will always be zero byte uh it’s
but uh luckily if you want to
fake a credit card uh the credit

00:26:34.875-->00:26:42.917
card reader won’t uh verify the-
fir- uh verify the UID to- uh
through wo- wo won’t verify your

00:26:42.917-->00:26:52.000
credit card via UID and uh um
and we didn’t find way to modify
the in a you know a long time

00:26:52.000-->00:26:58.417
test but uh uh i- cause most
money related application
wouldn’t check the identity of

00:26:58.417-->00:27:03.833
the card with the UID and the
other hand I think it’s a good
way to prevent this kind of

00:27:03.833-->00:27:10.750
attack. So secondly the waiting
and the wakeup time is a real
issue when you developing uh a

00:27:10.750-->00:27:23.167
proxy tool. So oh this it. When
you be uh wh- wh- wh it’s a real
issue when you want to develope

00:27:23.167-->00:27:28.542
a safe proxy tool so as you know
the apps they ca- the card it
doesn’t carry a power right? So

00:27:28.542-->00:27:35.167
uh it’ll use a power from reader
and if the rea- if the card
haven’t received any response

00:27:35.167-->00:27:40.833
from reader and you lose power
and turn off so apparently the
whole attacking proc- uh

00:27:40.833-->00:27:47.750
progress is just failed so
please remember to modify and uh
wake up a time and when you’re

00:27:47.750-->00:27:54.458
programming so remember the
hacking tool NFCGate which I
just used uh in my- in my

00:27:54.458-->00:28:01.667
experiment and uh uh it’s it’s
that’s that’s the same reason I
said okay I don’t want to use

00:28:01.667-->00:28:07.458
this tool because it didn’t
modify the wake time and it also
used the wi-fi network it also

00:28:07.458-->00:28:15.458
increased the delay time so uh
just remember to modify the wake
up time okay? Uh thirdly, oh

00:28:15.458-->00:28:31.250
okay, mmm thirdly in order to
fasten the whole pr- uh progress
we don’t need to transfer all

00:28:31.250-->00:28:36.542
kind of data between the reader
emulator and the card emulator.
So we just need to transfer

00:28:36.542-->00:28:43.833
I-Block data and s- directly
tran- progress S or R block uh
block data to responser in real

00:28:43.833-->00:28:55.125
time so it’s also mentioned in
ISO14443A part 4 so please just
read it carefully and uh also

00:28:55.125-->00:29:01.917
the power supply might also
cause the corrupt of the- of the
chipset so if you want to design

00:29:01.917-->00:29:07.583
the hardware of the cir- of the
power circuit you can just uh
you can just use a regular don’t

00:29:07.583-->00:29:16.417
try to use any tricks okay? So
uh let’s just see another demo
video of our- in our real

00:29:16.417-->00:29:23.458
environment which I use
someone’s credit card to buy a
big mac in McDonald’s.

00:29:23.458-->00:29:32.750
[chuckles] So you can see we
turn on the master one and slave
one so you can see someone’s

00:29:32.750-->00:29:49.958
wallet. Just place here and go
somewhere else and of course I
didn’t steal someone’s money

00:29:49.958-->00:30:14.000
it’s it’s my credit card
[laughter] Confirm the payment.
Start preparing and uh use Apple

00:30:14.000-->00:30:32.500
Pay or QuickPass, place it and
uh just grab your food.
[applause] thank you. Thank you.

00:30:32.500-->00:30:39.833
So uh we just described how to
attack a credit card right? So
this is how we defend it. Uh I

00:30:39.833-->00:30:46.833
don’t know I I saw a lot of
people use er pr- a blocking
sleeve to protect the card and

00:30:46.833-->00:30:54.167
also there is a RFID wallet to
prevent this kind and it’s just
there are also the coolest and

00:30:54.167-->00:31:00.958
you can use it and also we have
the RFID Jammer which I- of
course I built it uh I- we

00:31:00.958-->00:31:10.750
design and manufacture one but
uh um yeah we sell it and uh
that’s ours and uh GuardBunny

00:31:10.750-->00:31:17.208
you can us- uh you- er-
[inaudible] I think you can just
buy a blocking sleeve and RFID

00:31:17.208-->00:31:23.167
wallet or just GuardBunny it’s
really high in efficiency I
recommend that you t- have a

00:31:23.167-->00:31:30.625
try. So uh here’s a summary and
what we learned in this
development. So you need to read

00:31:30.625-->00:31:37.417
a protocol and you need to re-
read the protocol and document
well and it’s a lot of tricks

00:31:37.417-->00:31:44.500
inside so um better not to
develop it without official
support because when we are

00:31:44.500-->00:31:51.833
using the NXP chipsets it’s it’s
really a waste of time cause we
are stuck in some uh some weird

00:31:51.833-->00:31:57.958
mistakes and we just can’t read
the document as there is no
official support and we

00:31:57.958-->00:32:07.250
developed this but uh using I
think 6 months and uh if we used
official support I think this

00:32:07.250-->00:32:15.958
could be done in 2 months. So
furthermore I’d like to uh said
what we want to improve. So we

00:32:15.958-->00:32:21.458
want to improve the transmission
range up to 100 meters now
currently we can use these

00:32:21.458-->00:32:28.583
master and slave such as about
uh more than 50 minutes uh fif-
I’m sorry 50 meters so you can-

00:32:28.583-->00:32:33.625
I can just stand here and Runu-
my partner will stand about 50
meters away and to steal your-

00:32:33.625-->00:32:42.125
your- your informations, steal
your money. Yeah. But uh withou-
with some kind of amplifier we

00:32:42.125-->00:32:50.917
can just level up the the range
to 100 meters it’s as easy but
uh we need to do that. And also

00:32:50.917-->00:32:58.125
we as I just said my my initial
point is to fake my security ID
card but uh you know the the

00:32:58.125-->00:33:05.417
range between my home and to my
company is about 6 kilometers
away so I need to fix- I need to

00:33:05.417-->00:33:12.208
fix this issue [laughter] right?
Yeah. And also I want to make
this uh self-com- uh

00:33:12.208-->00:33:21.292
compatibility because one- it uh
now it’s just attacking one- uh
ISO you know uh 14443A and uh I

00:33:21.292-->00:33:30.500
want to make it uh adapted to
HID adapted to uh 15693 and I
want to let uh let it to you

00:33:30.500-->00:33:39.208
know know which protocol it is
using and uh want to make it so
the rest is how and uh I just

00:33:39.208-->00:33:45.542
want to make this fast and uh uh
published on the network so
everybody can you know everybody

00:33:45.542-->00:33:53.500
can learn and everybody can
build their own proxy tools. So
we re- here is our reference and

00:33:53.500-->00:34:03.542
I want to really thank them and
uh also the hardware division of
my team and uh uh the NFC tools

00:34:03.542-->00:00:00.000
which inspired me a lot. So any
question? [applause].
