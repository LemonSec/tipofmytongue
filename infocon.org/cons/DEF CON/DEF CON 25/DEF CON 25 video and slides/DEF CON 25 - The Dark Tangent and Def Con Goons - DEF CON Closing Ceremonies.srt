00:00:00.375-->00:00:07.000
>>Okay so I wanted to welcome
you all to Def Con 25 I'm really
curious, show of hands, I know

00:00:07.000-->00:00:12.875
it's not perfect but this hotel
compared to Paris Bally's, who
likes this one better? [crowd

00:00:12.875-->00:00:17.875
cheers] okay I'm glad you like
it 'cause we're here next year
[laughs] [cheering continues] If

00:00:23.375-->00:00:29.125
you didn't like it I don't know
what I would have done. And I
I'm told that the escalators

00:00:29.125-->00:00:34.125
will be fixed by next year so
[laughter and cheers] Um so
before we get going I just wanna

00:00:39.792-->00:00:45.375
start acknowledging um a lot of
the hard work a lot of us went
through to- to make this event

00:00:45.375-->00:00:50.375
happen um and some of you might
have seen a tweet about the- the
drama we had with the bean bags,

00:00:53.042-->00:00:59.333
these are the last two surviving
bean bags, right near, the
others have been kidnapped or

00:00:59.333-->00:01:04.500
'bean' napped or something um so
he's gonna take this bean bag
swirl it over his head and throw

00:01:04.500-->00:01:09.125
it into the audience on this
side and uh just to give you a
heads up I don't want a lawsuit

00:01:09.125-->00:01:15.417
so somebody on this side will be
the proud owner of a bean bag
and uh somebody on this side

00:01:15.417-->00:01:20.667
will be the proud owner of a
bean bag [cheering] here we go-
and this is to- this'll be the

00:01:20.667-->00:01:27.500
second year that we have had all
of our bean bags disappear
[laughter] go for it! No you're

00:01:27.500-->00:01:30.875
gonna throw em, you're closer to
the uh the people. [cheering]
[speaker laughs] [crowd cheers]

00:01:30.875-->00:01:35.875
Oh right on! Okay Paul, yeah go
for it. Yeah let's see how far
you can hurl the- [crowd cheers]

00:02:00.625-->00:02:05.333
[applause] So some of you might
have noticed that we weren't up
to our normal standard of super

00:02:05.333-->00:02:10.333
cool badges this year because of
uh an emergency uh with LostboY
which is- we really wish him

00:02:12.917-->00:02:18.500
good luck and I don't know if
you saw the we uh- 'bring back
Lost' badges that were going

00:02:18.500-->00:02:23.708
around so I've been talking to
Lost he's- he's he's all in so
don't worry next year we should

00:02:23.708-->00:02:30.375
be enjoying some masterful Lost
electronic construction
[cheering] so that'll be good.

00:02:30.375-->00:02:35.375
But it really turned out that um
badge life really became a thing
this year, it really seemed to

00:02:38.333-->00:02:44.833
be the tipping point and so even
though we didn't have a super
construction other people did

00:02:44.833-->00:02:49.208
and I really just want to just
call out Def Con 25 I think was
really the birth of this badge

00:02:49.208-->00:02:54.208
life so that was awesome!
Everybody who's designed a badge
give it up to them. [applause]

00:03:01.542-->00:03:06.458
It's always tricky every year
because we have, as you know, we
don't do pre registration so we

00:03:06.458-->00:03:11.625
don't know how many people to
expect, how much to buy, it's
really like uh- a lot of

00:03:11.625-->00:03:16.625
guessing um and so this year we
completely sold out and we want
to really think swag team

00:03:19.000-->00:03:23.833
working really hard we- we moved
more inventory on Thursday then
we did on Thursday and Friday

00:03:23.833-->00:03:28.625
last year so it's just really
worked out to be pretty popular
and of course the shirts we

00:03:28.625-->00:03:34.250
didn't think would be popular
were popular and vice versa and
uh the speaker control team

00:03:34.250-->00:03:38.333
really chipped in and helped out
so I just wanna acknowledge how
a lot of these teams work

00:03:38.333-->00:03:43.333
together and it's just a great
community [applause]. This is
how many goons it takes to pull

00:03:50.500-->00:03:56.333
of an event this size it takes
us back in world domination
headquarters planning about ten

00:03:56.333-->00:04:01.333
months out of the year and these
are all the teams that uh manage
and operate the con, there's

00:04:03.833-->00:04:08.833
over 380 goons to pull this off
so if you're a goon stand up and
let's acknowledge your awesome

00:04:10.875-->00:04:15.875
[applause] [cheering] Right on.
[applause continues] I wanna see
if you organized a contest, an

00:04:30.875-->00:04:36.750
event, or a party that any
attendee could enjoy stand up
because you are the ones that

00:04:36.750-->00:04:41.750
gave us all the enjoyable action
[applause] yeah! Alright and
this being Las Vegas um where

00:04:54.375-->00:04:58.625
they're very concerned about
safety and security I've just
been informed that the fire

00:04:58.625-->00:05:05.125
marshall would like us to stay
in our seats [laughs] so we will
now be waving our hands or maybe

00:05:05.125-->00:05:10.125
like the IETF we'll just snap
our fingers or hum loudly.
[laughter] If you are a goon

00:05:12.500-->00:05:17.500
that is either a first year goon
or a retiring goon let's just
have you wave your hands

00:05:26.250-->00:05:31.250
[laughs] Thank you! We try to
make it really easy at Def Con
for people to come and go and so

00:05:34.167-->00:05:40.125
we try to make it easy for you
to help out and if you get busy
with life or burned out or you

00:05:40.125-->00:05:45.417
need to move to some other
country and you can't quite
attend it's okay right? People

00:05:45.417-->00:05:49.458
come and go through Def Con we
try to make it as easy as
possible for people to

00:05:49.458-->00:05:56.042
contribute when and where they
can contribute and so um I just
would like to thank those- of

00:05:56.042-->00:05:59.958
those that are retiring I just
want to acknowledge all of their
past contributions because

00:05:59.958-->00:06:04.167
that's really valuable and it
really helped get us here I mean
we're really on the shoulders of

00:06:04.167-->00:06:09.167
giants. Also this year the
Hacker Tracker App became
official, it is now an official

00:06:11.833-->00:06:18.292
Def Con app and we're helping
provide them some support. Okay.
Who here downloaded this thing

00:06:18.292-->00:06:24.417
and really thought it was
useful? [cheering] Yeah! This is
awesome. We're just going to

00:06:24.417-->00:06:28.292
keep growing it and we're gonna
do what we can to provide them
support and next year it'll be

00:06:28.292-->00:06:34.958
just that much better so I think
uh that's really- been really
really cool. Okay so I'm gonna

00:06:34.958-->00:06:38.208
pass the microphone off we're
going to give you the quick low
down on what's been going on

00:06:38.208-->00:06:43.083
with NOC this year Luis is gonna
talk about some great new
equipment we had and he'll run

00:06:43.083-->00:06:48.083
some statistics so Luis
[applause] >>Thanks Jeff! Hello
Def Con 25, it's awesome to be

00:06:54.167-->00:06:59.167
here. I've been on my phone
because I heard the streaming
was down but now it is up,

00:07:03.250-->00:07:09.250
thanks VideoMan. [cheering] So
I'm just going to go through
some slides, this is mostly for

00:07:09.250-->00:07:15.750
a historic purpose and we so you
can download from Def Con
networking dot org later to see

00:07:15.750-->00:07:19.667
the statistics I'm not going to
go through the whole thing, but
if you don't know what we do

00:07:19.667-->00:07:24.667
here, the NOC does the whole
wired infrastructure uh which is
listed on your left and then for

00:07:28.833-->00:07:34.583
most of you what matters is in
the brave and then once they
patch their phones for wifi

00:07:34.583-->00:07:39.583
vulnerabilities um it's the the
wireless network and this- we're
going to talk a little bit about

00:07:41.625-->00:07:46.625
this and the DC TV we also do
that um VideoMan and Sarif they
do a great job making it work

00:07:49.792-->00:07:54.000
and trying to keep it working
that's been the- one of the
challenges we have this year and

00:07:54.000-->00:08:00.708
we appreciate the patience that
you guys have with us. So a
quick run down on the network um

00:08:00.708-->00:08:07.333
we have a 10 gig backbone uh
within the hotel uh the hotel is
awesome. The hotel IT and Encore

00:08:07.333-->00:08:14.208
staff, that is the company that
helps the hotel and us, they
are- I can not express how much

00:08:14.208-->00:08:19.208
uh we appreciate their jobs so
please give a hand- handout to
them. [applause] As for the gear

00:08:25.458-->00:08:28.792
that we have I'm not gonna go
through the whole thing, as I
said you can download this

00:08:28.792-->00:08:34.417
later, but we have a whole bunch
of stuff, we have some
enterprise class stuff and some

00:08:34.417-->00:08:39.417
non enterpri- enterprise class
things that we make everything
work uh wanna find out the

00:08:41.708-->00:08:46.708
wireless would mean using a 7210
Aruba Controller and last year
as you can see the- the second

00:08:49.958-->00:08:54.958
line there we had a whole bunch
of AP models and stuff, this
year we uh Aruba facilitated for

00:08:57.875-->00:09:02.875
us, seventy five new AP's so
this year we deployed 69 AP's
throughout the convention center

00:09:04.875-->00:09:09.875
and we had some spot- spotty
coverage and stuff like that but
uh thanks Aruba for helping us

00:09:12.833-->00:09:17.833
for the long term. [applause] As
for DC TV last year if you
remember or if you download the

00:09:24.458-->00:09:29.750
presentation from last year we
were using raspberry pis this
year we changed to OIDROIDs And

00:09:29.750-->00:09:36.042
the number, the odd number there
uh is because we were streaming
to Paris and Bally's which is

00:09:36.042-->00:09:41.042
gonna be on the issues uh slide
but it's it worked was the first
year um it's gonna get better.

00:09:46.458-->00:09:51.458
This is our network design we
can look at it later. [laughter]
K [laughter] so DC TV as you

00:09:57.000-->00:10:02.000
know we had last year was the
first time we were streaming in
H- HD. Uh so we capped that

00:10:04.667-->00:10:09.792
makes the end- the little
devices that make the conversion
sometimes a little upset and

00:10:09.792-->00:10:14.958
overheat and lock up but we're
gonna keep doing that it looks
nice. I had a chance to watch a

00:10:14.958-->00:10:21.542
little bit on my TV uh in the
hotel and we had this year so
five channels here at Caesar's

00:10:21.542-->00:10:27.000
and four channels at the other
hotels for because of uh
hardware limitations beyond our

00:10:27.000-->00:10:32.000
control. This is the timeline we
showed up a couple of us on
Saturday start working on Sunday

00:10:34.833-->00:10:40.167
and for the first time ever by
Wed- Wednesday night we had
everything done. Everything that

00:10:40.167-->00:10:45.167
was on the list [applause] Then
Thursday shows up and then we
have the last minute requests

00:10:51.125-->00:10:56.125
that are very uh usual and it's
it's good that we got stuff done
before so we can cater uh those

00:10:58.750-->00:11:03.833
that are- like room changes
there's there's a lot of things
once we show up on site not only

00:11:03.833-->00:11:08.917
us from the NOC but everyone
here the- the dynamic is good,
love the dynamic of working with

00:11:08.917-->00:11:14.583
the other groups- the other goon
groups it's been a great year
for us and now we're on Sunday

00:11:14.583-->00:11:20.917
we're gonna tear down and
tomorrow we go home and start
planning for next year. Issues,

00:11:20.917-->00:11:26.458
bandwidth, I love that you guys
use a lot of bandwidth but um
that's one of the issues that we

00:11:26.458-->00:11:31.458
have and we're gonna try to fix
that in the future, right Jeff?
>>Yes, Oh yes >>Jeff says yes.

00:11:34.833-->00:11:40.833
And DC TV we have like a
combination of things right?
When we try new things it's very

00:11:40.833-->00:11:45.833
hard to uh sometimes pinpoint a
problem uh but we worked hard as
I said before, VideoMan and

00:11:48.208-->00:11:54.292
Sarif they do a great job and I
really appreciate what what what
they do to make sure that this

00:11:54.292-->00:11:59.125
is going on right? This is going
on the internet right now so for
those that couldn't be here it's

00:11:59.125-->00:12:03.875
awesome to be able to to send
this information to them and yes
that IP address is from that

00:12:03.875-->00:12:08.875
movie back in the 90s. Um Wifi
stuff uh amazingly enough like
clients people really like to

00:12:14.500-->00:12:19.500
jump on the open network and do
bad things or not so good things
and but almost half or more than

00:12:21.792-->00:12:27.750
half use the the secure network
and we have the wifi reg and
stuff it's very interesting to

00:12:27.750-->00:12:33.000
see on the destination that
people use, you're still here
and using Facebook. I hope

00:12:33.000-->00:12:38.000
you're- I hope you're posting
things that you're learning
during the conference. Not gonna

00:12:40.375-->00:12:46.833
go through the numbers here but
we used um I was lazy and I used
the slides from last year so you

00:12:46.833-->00:12:51.958
can see that we used a little
bit of inbound traffic we went
up as expected seems we have

00:12:51.958-->00:12:56.958
more people outbound also a
little bit more but not too much
and the most important part here

00:12:59.792-->00:13:04.542
was that for the first time ever
we had more than two thousand
users on the wireless at the

00:13:04.542-->00:13:09.542
same time, so that's pretty
awesome [applause] This is our
team, the break down, we have

00:13:14.167-->00:13:21.125
twelve people total for doing a
conference this size it's pretty
amazing. Uh shout out to our our

00:13:21.125-->00:13:26.125
new member of the team uh Nancy
she's awesome she brought a lot
of good energy to the grumpy

00:13:28.667-->00:13:33.792
guys that we are so that's good.
[applause] and we also invited
Richard Cheese to be a part of

00:13:33.792-->00:13:40.083
the team but he was busy
preparing for his show. Really
special thanks to Jeff, he

00:13:40.083-->00:13:46.333
anytime we need to jump on a
call and get stuff resolved, he
helps a lot, Charel, without you

00:13:46.333-->00:13:51.500
this wouldn't be possible, Will
for getting- buying all the
stuff that we request or almost

00:13:51.500-->00:13:56.458
all the stuff that we request
but we we work together really
well >>Yeah we had to turn down

00:13:56.458-->00:14:02.875
the giant electric cat >>yes
[Crowd 'awes'] >>Yeah I know
you. You know I wanna see a

00:14:02.875-->00:14:07.875
giant electric cat next year you
know >>Yeah! [crowd cheers]
>>Yeah! As I said before

00:14:10.250-->00:14:14.583
Caesar's IT, Encore you guys are
awesome, Source of Knowledge
that does all the transcoding of

00:14:14.583-->00:14:19.500
the video that hopefully is
going to the internet since I'm
not checking my phone um the

00:14:19.500-->00:14:24.917
guys that for the past five, six
years bring us snacks to the NOC
they worked in the NOC or SOC

00:14:24.917-->00:14:30.208
before they know how good our
lives are. The press goons they
helped us a lot this year so

00:14:30.208-->00:14:35.208
Melanie and team, thanks so
much, Capitan Obvious from
Caesar's IT we love you uh Micah

00:14:38.458-->00:14:44.083
from Apple we don't love you
[laugh] The Machine and thanks
for you guys behaving on the

00:14:44.083-->00:14:49.083
network as much as you can
thanks so much [applause]
>>Sorry I was mesmerized by

00:14:55.708-->00:15:00.708
those numbers uh let's go to the
next one okay so here are all
the villages we have at Def Con

00:15:04.750-->00:15:11.167
there's quite a number of them
and if you remember back in the
day when uh Russ Rogers came to

00:15:11.167-->00:15:15.500
me and he said you know we gotta
do something more than just
having these speaking tracks um

00:15:15.500-->00:15:21.208
and so he came up with this idea
of the village and then quickly
the very first village you can

00:15:21.208-->00:15:24.875
see here 10th anniversary
Hardware Hacking Village, they
were the very first one and

00:15:24.875-->00:15:29.542
they've been keeping it real
ever since, every station was
busy and next year we're going

00:15:29.542-->00:15:34.542
to grow more stations for them.
Lockpick Village is also in the
10th I don't know why it's not

00:15:37.875-->00:15:43.583
on here but Lockpick Village is
also on it's 10th anniversary
and Tool and all the volunteers

00:15:43.583-->00:15:50.208
that make the Lockpick Village
awesome that's just an
incredible learning experience I

00:15:50.208-->00:15:55.583
remember I was in there and
there's like I don't know twelve
ten year old girl and you could

00:15:55.583-->00:15:59.417
tell that she was very skeptical
cause her dad was there and kind
of trying to force her to do

00:15:59.417-->00:16:03.500
something she didn't want to do
she was kind of like messing
around with this lock and then

00:16:03.500-->00:16:06.917
all of a sudden like the lock
po- it was like a master lock
and her eyes, the lo- the lock

00:16:06.917-->00:16:12.542
popped open and her eyes are
just like [sound effect] like I
did that? You mean locks are not

00:16:12.542-->00:16:17.542
secure? You mean I can like take
over the world? [laughs] I was
like mmmm. [Cheering] [laughs]

00:16:24.750-->00:16:29.792
And that was just like the most
immediate feedback I could watch
her like calculate calculate

00:16:29.792-->00:16:35.250
calculate it was like her
perception of the world changed
right there and that was thanks

00:16:35.250-->00:16:40.208
to the villages and this year
there's two new villages that
are joining. When we moved from

00:16:40.208-->00:16:46.167
Paris Bally's we were just out
of space, we didn't have enough
walls, this year we have more

00:16:46.167-->00:16:51.458
walls we have smaller spaces
more areas that we can break
people out into and so we added

00:16:51.458-->00:16:56.458
two villages, the Recon Village
on open source [applause] right
on Recon Village really I mean

00:17:00.417-->00:17:05.500
you guys were like you were not
a first year you showed up and
were almost feeling like almost

00:17:05.500-->00:17:10.083
like a third year event that's a
village that was really well
done and the Voting Machine

00:17:10.083-->00:17:15.083
Hacking Village which was a
runaway success we didn't quite
expect it to be so crazy and it

00:17:15.083-->00:17:20.083
was crazy by the end of the Con
every voting machine fell and
that's like two and a half days

00:17:30.333-->00:17:34.042
[applause] So this just kind of
gives you an idea and then I
also want to call out the ICS

00:17:34.042-->00:17:39.500
village um they weren't here
last year, but they're back this
year having a great time so it's

00:17:39.500-->00:17:43.250
really nice even when villages
can't make it one year they can
come back we're really welcoming

00:17:43.250-->00:17:48.500
and so we're constantly on the
lookout for new ideas and we
were gath- we were joking around

00:17:48.500-->00:17:53.417
earlier getting ready for this
and um and I was saying you know
what you know on Sunday we have

00:17:53.417-->00:17:57.958
so few people that buy badges
from us on Sunday we should just
close the registration

00:17:57.958-->00:18:02.958
department and stick the badges
in a vending machine. [laughter]
Vending Machine Hacking Village

00:18:09.292-->00:18:14.750
[laughs] [cheering] >>Woo!
>>'cause we all need potato
chips. Okay um just some quick

00:18:14.750-->00:18:21.625
statistics the Data Duplication
Village um near and dear to my
heart um you can see this year

00:18:21.625-->00:18:28.458
uh we broke last year's record
we've pushed more data. Look in
the lower left hand corner, you

00:18:28.458-->00:18:33.333
can see the drive types and
their failure rates I don't know
who Mediamax is but they really

00:18:33.333-->00:18:38.333
need to fix their S***t it's
like 43 percent failure rate,
you know? And it's too bad that

00:18:42.417-->00:18:47.583
HGST is around 18 perfect
failure rate it's pretty clear
that the best ones are Toshiba

00:18:47.583-->00:18:52.583
and Western Digital um anyway
the info con stuff is online as
well if you want to download it

00:18:54.750-->00:19:00.792
I just thought that this
community would like enjoy
statistics >>Yeah! >>[laughs]

00:19:00.792-->00:19:05.583
Okay so I'm gonna pass it off to
Grifter here for all the events,
contests and parties he's gonna

00:19:05.583-->00:19:09.708
kind of run through what we've
got and we're going to start
calling out some of the winners.

00:19:09.708-->00:19:14.708
>>Hey how's it going? >>Woo!
>>Ow! Oh my gosh Def Con bleh!
Um so so this year new venue new

00:19:25.500-->00:19:31.708
insanity um so thank you to all
of the organizers of villages

events here where we have

00:19:45.833-->00:19:50.833
friends of Bill uh Be The Match
all those guys came back I think
um hacker karaoke thought for a

00:19:54.333-->00:20:00.042
minute they weren't an event
somehow like a message got lost
somewhere and then three weeks

00:20:00.042-->00:20:03.708
ago when we said like oh hey we
still have some more space does
anybody want to do something

00:20:03.708-->00:20:09.333
they submitted again even though
they'd already been accepted
[laughter] so they were super

00:20:09.333-->00:20:15.625
stoked uh and it was sick if you
weren't if you weren't at hacker
karaoke this year it was crazy

00:20:15.625-->00:20:21.750
but thank you to all the event
organizers genuinely we really
had a blast and we appreciate

00:20:21.750-->00:20:26.750
your efforts. Um so let's get
into contests >>woo! >>woo!
>>That's a lot of contests um so

00:20:32.292-->00:20:37.542
you guys like to do stuff when
you're here you know no idle
hands right? Uh and here's the

00:20:37.542-->00:20:42.750
thing though this list is just a
little bit smaller than last
year so we had a couple of

00:20:42.750-->00:20:48.333
contests that were like for Def
Con 25 we just want to kick it
and we're just gonna hang out

00:20:48.333-->00:20:54.500
and enjoy the show and so a few
contests that have been around
for awhile um didn't return

00:20:54.500-->00:20:59.875
which means we have some
openings for contests so please

00:21:08.583-->00:21:14.000
us a little bit. I plan to sleep
for the rest of the week so but
seriously hit us up tell us what

00:21:14.000-->00:21:19.000
your ideas are um we had- we had
contests this year like the tin
foil hat contest was something

00:21:21.250-->00:21:27.458
that they just walked up and
said like hey we're like yes!
Over there tin foil hat

00:21:27.458-->00:21:33.167
[applause] Like it was just one
of those things where we're like
how the hell have we not had a

00:21:33.167-->00:21:37.958
tin foil contest- hat contest in
twenty five years and they were
like no it will be super simple

00:21:37.958-->00:21:42.958
they will just make hats and the
best hat wins yeah [laughter]
yeah alright done um So yeah

00:21:45.000-->00:21:49.083
tons of great contests if you
were in the contest area it was
always hopping obviously we also

00:21:49.083-->00:21:53.250
have contests that go on the
villages that uh that have a lot
of effort put into them as well

00:21:53.250-->00:21:59.500
so thanks to them uh and then I
just wanna say to my uh to my
team thank you to my contest

00:21:59.500-->00:22:06.167
goons I know they're around here
somewhere >>woo! >>Yes, yes
[applause] special- special

00:22:06.167-->00:22:11.167
thanks to- to Zant and to
Stomper and to Drist uh for- for
handling all the bidness um and

00:22:14.917-->00:22:19.917
then also I wanna throw out uh a
thank you not just not just like
to the contest folks but also a

00:22:22.917-->00:22:29.750
special thanks to Nikita sitting
over here Nikita helped
[applause] pull us out of many a

00:22:29.750-->00:22:36.333
hole this year um also I don't
know, I don't know- I don't know
how many people realize like

00:22:36.333-->00:22:43.083
Nikita handles every single
submission that comes through
Def Con so if you submit to the

00:22:43.083-->00:22:48.083
call for papers like she has to
deal with your crap some of it's
crap let's just be honest um but

00:22:50.500-->00:22:55.292
a lot of it requires feedback
which means that as the review
board asks for questions she has

00:22:55.292-->00:23:00.333
a dialogue back and forth with
whoever the submitter is and so
we're talking about a thousand

00:23:00.333-->00:23:05.917
submissions and an additional
hundreds and hundreds of
contacts thereafter so can we

00:23:05.917-->00:23:10.917
please get a round of applause
for Nikita? [applause]
[cheering] and Nikita's baby

00:23:19.417-->00:23:25.875
[chuckles] alright that's enough
sit down um Alright let's get
this thing rollin' so here are

00:23:25.875-->00:23:30.875
our black badge contests uh for
Def Con this year we're gon- so-
we don't announce which contests

00:23:36.750-->00:23:43.000
are going to be a black badge
contest until essentially this
morning, every Sunday morning,

00:23:43.000-->00:23:48.000
and here's why, look at that
list. You're not all getting
into Def Con free for life like

00:23:50.750-->00:23:55.750
I'm sorry it's just- it's not a
thing uh however we we have a
few badges that we give out and

00:23:57.917-->00:24:02.500
we don't want it to be something
where you know that a certain
contest is gonna have a black

00:24:02.500-->00:24:07.208
badge and so that's the contest
that everybody focuses on and
maybe a contest that's new or

00:24:07.208-->00:24:14.125
just starting out gets
completely ignored so at any
point we will decide this

00:24:14.125-->00:24:19.250
contest is doing a killer job
they're gonna be a black badge
contest even if they have no

00:24:19.250-->00:24:25.333
idea they're in the running uh
we just pick them out so that
you as attendees will just go do

00:24:25.333-->00:24:30.333
what you love or go learn
something new and we don't have
to worry about having new

00:24:32.333-->00:24:36.958
contests that have two people
playing it so just get out there
and play the contest that you're

00:24:36.958-->00:24:41.958
going enjoy that you'll learn
something from and maybe you'll
get into Def Con free for life.

00:24:49.875-->00:24:54.583
[applause] [off mic comment]
>>Okay Um also that means that
contests sometimes that do get

00:24:54.583-->00:24:58.458
black badges may not have one
the next year I just want to
point that out that it doesn't

00:24:58.458-->00:25:02.375
mean that that contest fell in
quality or anything we just
again we can't give them to the

00:25:02.375-->00:25:08.208
same people every year so um
before we get to this I'm gonna
let Jeff say a couple of words

00:25:08.208-->00:25:13.208
about the uber badge so >>Yeah.
Hey so um because we had our
badge construction problem this

00:25:17.458-->00:25:22.458
year same thing we had a problem
with the uber badge construction
and uber badges are are pretty

00:25:24.583-->00:25:29.583
awesome and we had like ten days
to create an uber badge which is
pretty difficult to do um and so

00:25:33.583-->00:25:37.750
we thought we had a great
solution we had this awesome
solution we figured it out it

00:25:37.750-->00:25:44.000
went to manufacturing we got the
proofs, we validated the proofs,
we approved them, it went to

00:25:44.000-->00:25:49.000
final production, and it got
shipped out Fedex Saturday
delivery and they checked Fedex

00:25:52.458-->00:25:57.458
overnight normal. >>Boo! >>So
the uber badges will be here
tomorrow at 10am [laughter] just

00:26:02.042-->00:26:07.750
in time! And the person who
checked the box wrong realized
it immediately, tried to fix it,

00:26:07.750-->00:26:13.583
I guess once you've checked that
box you're done it's like a
blood contract you cannot change

00:26:13.583-->00:26:19.875
your Fedex shipping um so we
have one badge I'm holding it
right here this is the one uber

00:26:19.875-->00:26:24.417
badge to sh- to tease you to
tease the teams of what they're
going to be getting so what's

00:26:24.417-->00:26:30.792
going to happen is the team's
win get acknowledged everybody
exits to the left we're going to

00:26:30.792-->00:26:36.167
record who gets the uber badge
and we're going to send it to
you so hopefully I wanna sh-

00:26:36.167-->00:26:42.000
hold this and hopefully the
camera can put it on the screens
if we can video switch um can

00:26:42.000-->00:26:47.000
you switch to me please
[laughter] 'cause this is really
small nope um and then hopefully

00:26:52.333-->00:26:56.875
people will be able to take
pictures nope? No video
switching? We even talked to you

00:26:56.875-->00:27:01.875
about this [sighs] [laughter]
Okay so what I'm holding in my
hand [laughter] [cheering] This

00:27:09.917-->00:27:14.917

me being you know the over
organizer so you know herding

00:31:35.500-->00:31:40.500
cats of hackers has you know

00:31:42.750-->00:31:49.583
designed by Straith and Maya and
myself um as well as a badge
that Karl Koscher put together

00:31:49.583-->00:31:56.042
and we had a puzzle two years
ago and I thought no one's
solving this like why do it

00:31:56.042-->00:32:01.042
again and three weeks after the
conference a team finished it
and we sent them their prize la-

00:32:04.208-->00:32:10.042
last year I thought well we do
all this work we're not really
sure anyone is actually solving

00:32:10.042-->00:32:15.708
this and the team came back and
said where's your puzzle and I
was like errrm like sorry

00:32:15.708-->00:32:22.250

same team that won our first
year and asked about it our
second year uh won this year and

00:34:02.042-->00:34:07.375
vulnerabilities, things like
buffer overflow and command
injection and for the actual

00:34:07.375-->00:34:13.958
black badge contest I will let
Josh announce the stats on that.
>>Hey everyone. Uh so

00:34:13.958-->00:34:18.958
SOHOpelessly Broken it started
out in 2013 with a coworker of
mine he did a research study

00:34:21.000-->00:34:25.583
into routers he found that
everything he looked at was
vulnerable to something and he

00:34:25.583-->00:34:31.292
decided well why not turn it
into a CTF and have it at Def
Con so uh we we've had it since

00:34:31.292-->00:34:36.292
then and last year was our first
time as a black badge contest uh
so after that we were like oh

00:34:38.917-->00:34:43.125
how are we going to top
ourselves this year uh but I
think we did a really good job

00:34:43.125-->00:34:48.125
we had 93 teams compete and over
half of them scored a flag so
good job guys [applause] yeah

intense round after round after

00:37:35.292-->00:37:40.292
many volunteers but it was epic

1100 on the board to be got

00:37:51.583-->00:37:56.583

own crypto this year we had
insane steganography, x-fill

00:37:58.792-->00:38:03.125
from all sorts of different
methods, brand new malware that
you guys are playing with in in

00:38:03.125-->00:38:08.125

minutes, A, B, no I'm good
alright thanks everyone
[applause] >>Alright so this

00:38:53.125-->00:38:59.500
next contest is actually one of
those situations where again
they- they never intended to be

00:38:59.500-->00:39:04.583
in the running they just created
something cool and we heard so
much about it over the course of

00:39:04.583-->00:39:09.333
the weekend uh that we
eventually got together with
them and said, how about an uber

00:39:09.333-->00:39:14.333
badge and they were like sure
[laughter] so here they are
Telephreak [applause] >>Okay uh

00:39:24.333-->00:39:29.333
so wow this is bright up here um
on Thursday the first time at uh
Telephreak for a a company- in

00:39:35.625-->00:39:39.500
this- uh pardon me the first
time at Def Con for a company
happened and this happens a lot

00:39:39.500-->00:39:43.625
you know employees of companies
will come to Def Con and
sometimes they'll get a little

00:39:43.625-->00:39:48.792
bit drunk and maybe they'll say
too much or or do something they
shouldn't so [inaudible] mineral

00:39:48.792-->00:39:53.708
company came to Def Con on
Thursday they all go really
drunk and lost their badges just

00:39:53.708-->00:40:00.375
all around the Con area and uh
those badges were actually the
entry point to the Telephreak

00:40:00.375-->00:40:05.000
puzzle this year so uh we run a
puzzle pretty much every year
last year it was based around

00:40:05.000-->00:40:11.542
old school hacker floppy discs
and this year it was based on
phreaking so uh our winning team

00:40:11.542-->00:40:17.250
um actually solved the puzzle
using only telephones and you
know that's one thing that we

00:40:17.250-->00:40:21.292
tried to teach hackers this year
'cause we always have an
educational component to the

00:40:21.292-->00:40:27.167
challenge is you don't need
MetaSploit and Shodan to hack
there's actually tons of stuff

00:40:27.167-->00:40:33.292
out there that you can hack uh
without the tools that many of
us use uh so with that uh I'd

00:40:33.292-->00:40:38.292
really like to congratulate the
Psychoholics they went through
an absolutely insane challenge

00:40:40.667-->00:40:46.792
[applause] they dialed into our
uh they dialed into our system
hacked through 3 different

00:40:46.792-->00:40:51.250
departments voicemail boxes,
listened to all their
voicemails, uh, you know,

00:40:51.250-->00:40:57.500
figured out what was going on in
the scenario, literally got a
shutdown code for the Gibson

00:40:57.500-->00:41:02.500
which um and and you know they
shut it down over a phone uh you
know using a PDU alarm code so

00:41:05.792-->00:41:10.750
you know this was actually um
something that could be done
without a computer but we did

00:41:10.750-->00:41:14.708
put a three hundred bod
recording just to mess with
people and they successfully

00:41:14.708-->00:41:19.708
decoded that too so uh
congratulations guys [applause]
>>Alright uh this next contest

00:41:34.917-->00:41:39.917
the if you were around on Friday
morning the line just to get in
and get a badge and compete was

00:41:43.083-->00:41:48.083
so big that it caused a crowd
control problem so [laughter]
like thanks for that [laughter]

00:41:52.000-->00:41:57.000
>>You're welcome! >>The Darknet
Project [applause] >>The Darknet
Project is an interactive game

00:42:06.958-->00:42:12.583
that takes our players through a
bunch of challenges that take
them through lockpicking to web

00:42:12.583-->00:42:19.458
cracking to web exploitation and
this year we had an amazing turn
out, lots of players, and um I'm

00:42:19.458-->00:42:25.167
going to turn this over to
Samosa to talk a little bit
about the next part. >>So uh I'm

00:42:25.167-->00:42:31.292
the one responsible for the uh
crowd control problem we uh make
our contest bigger and better

00:42:31.292-->00:42:36.292
every year, this year we started
with our badges uh we moved over
a thousand badge kits for our

00:42:38.583-->00:42:43.583
Learn to Solder kit um we had
five hundred unique players and
they completed over the course

00:42:47.292-->00:42:52.292
of three days nine thousand
quests so it was a really big
contest this year [applause]

00:42:58.167-->00:43:04.250
>>So I was on stage just here
during the closing ceremony and
not as a staff member but as a

00:43:04.250-->00:43:09.583
Darknet winner and the one thing
I have to say is that Darknet
made me feel like a part of the

00:43:09.583-->00:43:14.583
community and we want to keep
this feeling and make everyone
feel this way so this year and

00:43:17.333-->00:43:24.208
it's the first day- it's the
first year we're doing this we
include the names of three teams

00:43:24.208-->00:43:31.000
that we feel embody the spirit
of Darknet onto the next year's
badge and the teams are,

00:43:31.000-->00:43:36.000
Dissazea, Stickers, and Tits
[laughter] [applause] >>Uh but
uh but- besides the the first

00:43:49.458-->00:43:55.833
second thir- um third players
and what they're receiving we
had swages, badges, reputation,

00:43:55.833-->00:44:02.125
experience, that was handed out
to players, reputation, um built
on the etherium chain and pretty

00:44:02.125-->00:44:07.583
crazy things that were happening
um our third place- third place,
second place, and first place

00:44:07.583-->00:44:13.167
are also receiving a pre
released signed tenth
anniversary edition of the

00:44:13.167-->00:44:19.083
Daemon written by Daniel Suarez
who sort of inspired the
competition he signed them and

00:44:19.083-->00:44:26.042
he was wandering around the
conference. Um Our third place
winner was Kexel our second was

00:44:26.042-->00:44:31.125
Concil Org and our third place
winner, winner of the black
badge >>First place winner

00:44:31.125-->00:44:36.125
>>first place winner was Gate
Herder [applause] >>Hey guys so
I I agree with Ohai there that

00:44:44.375-->00:44:50.333
Darknet is amazing, it's fun,
it's a community, uh, I'm a
hardware guy not a software guy

00:44:50.333-->00:44:54.792
and and an- I came to Darknet a
couple years ago this is my
third year trying because I

00:44:54.792-->00:45:00.708
don't know this stuff and so I
came to learn it and I- I played
hard and uh I want to thank

00:45:00.708-->00:45:05.542
first of all my lord and savior
Jesus Christ, without him I
wouldn't even be here, second I

00:45:05.542-->00:45:10.333
want to thank my wife and my
family because without them I
wouldn't even be here, third I

00:45:10.333-->00:45:15.125
want to thank Dissazea the guys
who brought me into their wings
a couple of years ago and said

00:45:15.125-->00:45:20.125
hey come join us and uh I
encourage everybody to do
Darknet next year, thank you.

00:45:24.208-->00:45:29.083
[applause] >>So Darknet is
obviously a big contest that's
really important to a lot of us

00:45:29.083-->00:45:33.958
it wouldn't happen without a
whole slew of volunteers working
year around to try to make this

00:45:33.958-->00:45:40.542
whole thing happen. Between
designing, kitting, selling, and
then assembling thous- uh over a

00:45:40.542-->00:45:45.875
thousand badge kits, we had uh
our badge designers, we have
volunteers that help us put all

00:45:45.875-->00:45:50.292
of it together and um then HHV
allowing us to take over their
entire village so that we could

00:45:50.292-->00:45:55.667
solder all of these kits, thank
you buddy, we appreciate you
very much. Um as ZeroA

00:45:55.667-->00:46:00.375
mentioned, we wouldn't be here
without all the volunteers in
the thousands of hours they put

00:46:00.375-->00:46:04.833
in to design all of our content,
build all of the physical
hackables and integrate with all

00:46:04.833-->00:46:09.375
of the other contests that we
have going on here at Def Con,
third we have Daniel Suarez the

00:46:09.375-->00:46:13.542
author and creator of the Daemon
universe that inspired the
Darknet and he's actively

00:46:13.542-->00:46:17.500
involved in everything that we
do and finally to all of our
amazing players, if you

00:46:17.500-->00:46:22.750
participated in Darknet raise
your hands everything we do is
for you guys and we look forward

00:46:22.750-->00:46:27.750
to doing more of it next year,
thank you and we'll see you in
July [applause] >>Alright this

00:46:30.167-->00:46:35.167
next contest uh is a personal
favorite of mine, these guys
come with a bunch of mini

00:46:39.042-->00:46:44.875
challenges, it's a CTF but done
in a very unique way lots of
different skillsets and if you

00:46:44.875-->00:46:48.500
get stuck on something you move
on to the next challenge and
you're not just out of the game.

00:46:48.500-->00:46:52.583
Um one team gave me some
feedback they said hey we were
gonna try to do all of the

00:46:52.583-->00:46:55.917
challenges and they're like yeah
we're doing, this we're doing
this, and they showed up the

00:46:55.917-->00:47:00.917
next morning and these guys had
created ten more so they were
like come at me bro! uh Warl0ck

00:47:05.750-->00:47:12.125
gam3z [applause] >>How's
everybody doing this afternoon?
Alright bout ready to get out of

00:47:12.125-->00:47:17.042
here right? Um so we uh had
several events this year we
always try to introduce

00:47:17.042-->00:47:22.125
something new um we're always uh
looking for new and innovative
ways to get folks involved uh

00:47:22.125-->00:47:27.792
this year we opened up the board
the hands on downloadable
content kind of thing, security

00:47:27.792-->00:47:32.500
practitioner, malware analysis,
packet analysis, from there we
moved into physical security and

00:47:32.500-->00:47:37.333
then uh yesterday we ran uh
essentially a spy room like uh
an escape room uh where

00:47:37.333-->00:47:41.833
contestants had five minutes to
go in there and find all sorts
of neat spy related stuff uh

00:47:41.833-->00:47:46.750
which equated to points on the
board collectively all of that
led to our leader board. So

00:47:46.750-->00:47:52.375
without further adieu uh I've
got all my teams up here um and
in third place I have team

00:47:52.375-->00:47:57.375
Ambush, in second place I've got
uh Team Sophia, and the black
badge winner this year is going

00:48:02.833-->00:48:07.833

[applause] >>Alright Wireless

00:48:55.417-->00:48:59.583
me to talk about nothing but my
sp- alright darn I was gonna
steal that >>Nooo >>I'll let you

00:48:59.583-->00:49:04.625
guys see it I'll distract you
the whole time >>Oh wowww >>Look
at that, look at that love >>So

00:49:04.625-->00:49:09.167
I was going to say something
negative because at Def Con 15
there were actually three

00:49:09.167-->00:49:13.083
villages that started up and
that was Hardware Hacking
Village, and Lockpicking

00:49:13.083-->00:49:18.792
Village, and the Wireless
Village, but to be honest uh you
guys gave us double the space

00:49:18.792-->00:49:23.292
this year and we packed it and
we had more contestants than
ever at our game so I'm just

00:49:23.292-->00:49:27.250
gonna say thank you instead,
thank you, that was- this was
the best we've ever had and we

00:49:27.250-->00:49:32.792
really appreciate that, so thank
you to Def Con for giving us
such a space [applause] So ten

00:49:32.792-->00:49:37.792
years in we decided to do uh
something special the same thing
we always do we had a big

00:49:40.792-->00:49:45.167
contest, Wireless Capture the
Flag with all manner of stuff,
we had a bunch of epoxide

00:49:45.167-->00:49:51.250
transmissions, slow scan TV,
sorry about that if you decoded
it seriously uh [chuckles] we

00:49:51.250-->00:49:55.333
also had a bunch of wifi
challenges, radio challenges, uh
for the second year in a row

00:49:55.333-->00:50:00.833
nobodies broken into our walkie
talkies which is kind of fun for
us so uh yeah it's been a lot of

00:50:00.833-->00:50:04.958
fun and all kinds of different
wireless stuff and we really
look forward to doing this again

00:50:04.958-->00:50:10.167
so I'd like to uh thank the
twenty-ish teams that were
playing, really appreciate that

00:50:10.167-->00:50:14.125
uh and from new players to old
players to returning favorites,
to returning people that are now

00:50:14.125-->00:50:20.083
banned from the game uh thanks
for playing uh third place is
Dale's Pale Ales, uh second

00:50:20.083-->00:50:26.333
place was the DIEPOLlar Bears
that- that's DIEPOL you know not
anything negative and then uh

00:50:26.333-->00:50:31.333
these guys up here which had to
call themselves, What Does The
Fox Say, not only did the vast

00:50:33.625-->00:50:38.750
majority of their points come
from literally hunting people
down at Def Con they did across

00:50:38.750-->00:50:44.750
wifi, bluetooth, and software
defined radio so if you saw
weirdos running around with

00:50:44.750-->00:50:47.875
Yagis that were pointing at
everybody it was probably one of
these guys because they won

00:50:47.875-->00:50:53.708

matter of fact this fine
gentleman who I guess will go-

00:50:53.708-->00:50:56.875

uh, he was on the winning team
last year mind you he's got a

00:50:56.875-->00:51:01.083
new team more or less behind him
but he was on the winning team
last year so he's officially

00:51:01.083-->00:51:06.083
retiring whether he likes it or
not because he's joining our
ranks so we were five and now we

00:51:10.208-->00:51:15.208
are six, so welcome to the team
buddy [applause] >>Justice
Beaver! >>Alright first I wanna

00:51:18.125-->00:51:22.375

these guys I could not have done
it without them uh everybody

00:51:22.375-->00:51:27.500

and I guess the only thing I
have to say is uh you know three

00:51:27.500-->00:51:32.792
years ago I was a noob and now I
stand up here in front of all of
you guys for the second time so

00:51:39.083-->00:51:44.083
>>Thank you! [applause] >>Get
off the stage >>Alright from the
Car Hacking Village, the Car

00:51:50.833-->00:51:55.833
Hacking CTF [applause] >>Oh yeah
definitely, definitely very
bright alright thank you guys,

00:52:01.375-->00:52:06.375

actually I'm- I'm CarF**ker and
as CarF**ker I'd like to say

00:52:14.500-->00:52:20.750
thank you to everybody who came
out to our our village and thank
you to the teams who

00:52:20.750-->00:52:25.750
participated in our CTF, this
year we had 171 teams a
significant number of teams uh

00:52:27.917-->00:52:33.792
hacking cars so that was kind of
cool um we actually had a actual
real live car in our place to

00:52:33.792-->00:52:38.792
hack uh we had a bunch of
hardware um so I'll just go
quickly through the teams real

00:52:38.792-->00:52:43.792
quick, um number three was
Trashcan, number two our friends
uh Sec DSM [applause] >>Yeah

00:52:46.417-->00:52:51.417

a black badge so that's cool um
and I'm gonna totally totally uh

00:52:53.958-->00:53:00.750
f**k this up um Rob- Robindires,
robanderos, uh close enough, it
means stealing shit in Spanish

00:53:00.750-->00:53:05.750
um um so it was really close uh
the top two teams were exactly
100 points from each other and

00:53:10.417-->00:53:15.250
this year the implication of
that means that one team gets to
take home a truck and the other

00:53:15.250-->00:53:20.250
does not cause we uh decided to
give away a truck and a black
badge yes, a Def Con truck, it-

00:53:22.292-->00:53:27.042
it's a 2017 Def Con um we have

duh-nuh [singing Jaws song]
[laughter] >>Um so these guys

00:54:52.250-->00:54:56.333
have their contest up on the
stage, it's a lot of shenanigans
these are sanctioned and not

00:54:56.333-->00:55:01.333
unsanctioned shenanigans and
they drink quite a bit actually
so much that they ran outta beer

00:55:01.333-->00:55:06.375
ten minutes before the end of
the contest and we kind of
looked at them and went I- like

00:55:06.375-->00:55:11.375
we had no reason to think you
would drink that much um
[laughter] and so uh let's hear

00:55:13.625-->00:55:18.625
from those guys Crash and
Compile [applause] >>So yeah
Crash and Compile is basically a

00:55:26.542-->00:55:32.333
ACM style programming contest
combined with a drinking game so
we give you a problem you solve

00:55:32.333-->00:55:37.333
it in code and yeah if you took
the code didn't compile or you
don't get the right answer you

00:55:40.458-->00:55:46.208
have to take a drink so our- we
had the hardest year by far uh
this ba***rd created some

00:55:46.208-->00:55:51.208
brutally challenging problems uh
and we had some amazing teams
who uh uh competed this year so

00:55:54.125-->00:55:59.125
uh >>How many teams? >>We had a
total of 51 teams try out for
our qualification round and then

00:56:02.583-->00:56:07.583
uh from there 9 teams go on to
the final round uh so our third
place winner was uh

00:56:10.625-->00:56:15.625
VolatileConsis second place was
Mobius Ring and then our first
place winner is Gird Your Loins

00:56:19.000-->00:56:24.000
and so for winning [applause]
they get this giant metal D20
made out of 12 gauge steel it

00:56:26.958-->00:56:32.083
weighs about 14 pounds good luck
getting it home [laughs]
[inaudible off-mic comment] uh I

00:56:32.083-->00:56:37.083
don't know how many beers they
had I know we drank all of them
[laughs] so and I guess they get

00:56:41.000-->00:56:46.500
a black badge too that's kinda
cool so um but yeah we also made
a second one and we auctioned it

00:56:46.500-->00:56:51.500
off for the EFF and we raised uh
four hundred dollars for that so
thanks everyone [applause] >>So

00:56:58.208-->00:57:01.708
uh again if you guys haven't
seen the contest they have
another team on there called

00:57:01.708-->00:57:06.417
Team Distraction which is a
supposed to try to get people
distracted from what they're

00:57:06.417-->00:57:11.542
coding or looking at and uh
Nikita joined for a little bit
on Team Distraction and

00:57:11.542-->00:57:16.542
pretended to go into labor
behind a guy [applause]
successfully distracted

00:57:22.250-->00:57:28.208
[laughter] >>Alright uh this is
the 20th an- this is the 20th
anniversary for this contest, 20

00:57:28.208-->00:57:34.125
uh it's one that I actually ran
myself for several years back at
the Alexis Park uh we love em

00:57:34.125-->00:57:39.125
they keep it weird, the
Scavenger Hunt >>Yeah! Woo!
[applause] [inaudible audience

00:57:42.250-->00:57:47.250
shouting] >>Hi there! Uh I'm
Evil Mofo and uh I run the
Scavenger Hunt um so since I

00:57:54.042-->00:57:59.917
winged it a couple times I kinda
wrote something to slightly
follow um so we keep Def Con

00:57:59.917-->00:58:05.708
weird that's our- our goal and
I'm fairly certain we
accomplished it this year uh we

00:58:05.708-->00:58:10.708
had uh 3 turn ins of carbonated
siemen >>Woo! Yeah! >>3
streakers in the contest room

00:58:15.625-->00:58:20.625
>>Yeah! Woo! >>And one marriage
[laughter] uh [applause] so I
wouldn't be here if it wasn't

00:58:27.625-->00:58:34.417
for a couple people uh as as
Grifter mentioned he kinda ran
it but before him came Penguino

00:58:34.417-->00:58:39.417
with him came Hectic, Grifter of
course, then there's Siviak and
then he handed it off to Salem

00:58:44.125-->00:58:49.125
he was too busy gooning so I ran
it but I've- I've taken it over
um so uh we we tried our best to

00:58:53.583-->00:58:58.583
invite all the winners in the
past apparently my predecessor's
weren't good at record keeping

00:59:02.417-->00:59:07.417
so we only got some of them but
we got most of them um and so
this year we had a great

00:59:10.083-->00:59:14.833
competition we're gonna go
through the top 5 cause they
were freaking amazing. The fifth

00:59:14.833-->00:59:19.833

two carts worth of items as we
were closing the table and it

00:59:22.292-->00:59:27.292
shut down we had to reopen just
for them just to take in their
items for a half an hour and it

00:59:30.167-->00:59:35.167

entertaining and out of control
Hack Fortress [crowd cheers]

01:02:49.583-->01:02:54.583
>>Thank you Grifter. PWCrack
said I could go as long as I
want so if the fires could bring

01:02:54.583-->01:03:00.542
me the Everclear that'd be
appreciated um Bob's gonna kill
me uh so this started out

01:03:00.542-->01:03:05.542
actually as uh I think in uh
Defcon 19 I got scheduled for
the 10am slot at uh Sunday um

01:03:09.208-->01:03:13.042
and I decided to make it
exciting and I had a lan party
that I tried to organize at nine

01:03:13.042-->01:03:18.000
o'clock um beforehand and like 4
people showed up we had 2
laptops so it wasn't a very good

01:03:18.000-->01:03:23.167
lan party um and we decided that
what was interesting was the
audience really enjoyed watching

01:03:23.167-->01:03:27.417
it so we thought well we should
do something kind of hacker
oriented and we already had uh

01:03:27.417-->01:03:32.208
Hacker Halo back at ShmooCon in
DC so we took Hacker Halo and
Team Fortress 2 and jammed them

01:03:32.208-->01:03:37.000
together into these kind of 30
minute hacker TF2 furnetic round
based things um and someone

01:03:37.000-->01:03:41.458
inspired by the Ghetto Hackers
um and their badass crate that
they used to bring all their uh

01:03:41.458-->01:03:46.167
oh thank you it's not Everclear
but it'll work uh but the Ghetto
Hackers and their badass crate

01:03:46.167-->01:03:49.750
that they used to have in the
middle of the CTF room we
brought in our own Hack Fortress

01:03:49.750-->01:03:54.875
crate it was like 8 feet tall
and wobbled around and shit um
but that was uh 6 years ago so

01:03:54.875-->01:03:59.708
we've been doing Hack Fortress
now for six years uh it's just
TFT and a little bite size

01:03:59.708-->01:04:04.958
hacking competitions like 3 to
10 minutes things uh it's fun to
watch this year for the first

01:04:04.958-->01:04:09.750
time we streamed on Twitch um we
had a few hundred people watch
on Twitch Daku and Cisco uh the

01:04:09.750-->01:04:13.833
man with the beard there we're
doing the live stream uh so that
was cool so if you're into

years of Def Con Capture the
Flag have been an incredible

01:05:42.875-->01:05:47.875
fide for us, for our competitors
and for the larger Def Con
community. After five years

01:05:50.208-->01:05:55.917
dozens of challenges, hundreds
of binaries, and tens of
thousands of hours of work we're

01:05:55.917-->01:06:00.917
passing the torch to the next
organizing team whoever they may
be there are still amazing

01:06:03.875-->01:06:09.042
opportunities to grow Capture
the Flag and with the skill and
creativity of everyone in this

01:06:09.042-->01:06:14.042
room we're sure the contest will
end up in capable hands that
will raise the bar even higher

01:06:16.667-->01:06:22.083
we'd like to thank everyone who
made the last five years
possible, the Dark Tangent and

01:06:22.083-->01:06:28.208
the entire Def Con staff for
five years of incredible
support, the Def Con goons for

01:06:28.208-->01:06:33.833
keeping the Capture the Flag
rooms afe and drama free for
five years straight, all of our

01:06:33.833-->01:06:40.417
competitors for five years of
excitement, and most importantly
the Def Con attendees and CTF

01:06:40.417-->01:06:46.083
players around the world for
five years of this incredible
game we couldn't have done this

01:06:46.083-->01:06:51.083
without all of you. [applause]
>>Woo! >>[sighs] [laughs] Hi
everybody. So uh last year I

01:06:58.667-->01:07:03.667
stood in front of a room it was
a little smaller than this one
and uh I announced that this

01:07:16.833-->01:07:22.542
year we would be running the Def
Con Capture the Flag on an
architecture of our design about

01:07:22.542-->01:07:28.833
six mon- er- about four months
ago DT called me and he was like
hey are you sure that the teams

01:07:28.833-->01:07:35.000
at the CTF are going to be able
to do something interested in
the 72 hours of our game I was

01:07:35.000-->01:07:40.750
like oh yeah man I'm sure- sure
they got this uh I'm happy to
report that the teams not only

01:07:40.750-->01:07:45.750
succeeded but they absolutely
crushed it >>Yeah! >>This year's
game used the clemency

01:07:48.500-->01:07:53.500
architecture an all new 27 bit
with 9 bit bytes [laughs]
computer designed by our own

01:08:00.667-->01:08:05.667
Lightning >>Woo! [applause] >>Oh
also Middle Indian it was great
Thursday morning we released it

01:08:17.333-->01:08:22.333
to the public along with a
processor manual an emulator and
a debugger and that was it

01:08:25.500-->01:08:30.125
Friday morning the teams came to
play and the amount of work they
did to build the tooling they

01:08:30.125-->01:08:35.333
needed to succeed in our game
was incredible. We had teams
with Ida modules overnight,

01:08:35.333-->01:08:40.333
binary ninja modules overnight,
some team built a uh clemency to
arm transpiler and then used an

01:08:43.125-->01:08:49.458
arm decompiler to lift up to see
it was- it was incredible we we
didn't expect anything like that

01:08:49.458-->01:08:54.458
[applause] so I think it's fair
to say that the teams have ri-
risen to the challenge and

01:08:59.667-->01:09:05.625
developed new tools for reverse
engineering, patching, and
attacking our crazy custom

01:09:05.625-->01:09:10.625
architecture. As usual the
winning team for the Def Con
Capture the Flag will receive 8

01:09:13.333-->01:09:18.333
uber badges and 8 black leather
jackets >>Woo! [applause] >>What
was that? [applause continues]

01:09:27.125-->01:09:32.375
We hope the new organizers
whoever they will be will
continue to honor the tradition

01:09:32.375-->01:09:37.375
of inviting the first place team
back to defend their title next
year [applause] In third place

01:09:47.042-->01:09:52.042
from uh China we had A*0*E
[applause] In second place from
Taiwan we had HitCon [applause]

01:10:05.458-->01:10:10.458
[whistle] and I'm almost tired
of saying it at this point, but
the winners of the Def Con

01:10:17.750-->01:10:22.042
Capture the Flag this year was
PPP the Plaid Parliament of
Pwning [applause] [crowd cheers]

01:10:22.042-->01:10:27.042
>>Woo! [inaudible off mic
comment] >>Uh No, sorry >>Hi
>>Hey >>Thank you am I supposed

01:10:44.125-->01:10:49.125
to talk? >>Sure >>Oh alright
well I'm a little sick but uh
first off thank you so much to

01:10:51.250-->01:10:57.000
Legit BS when we heard they were
doing a custom architecture we
pretty much thought that's gonna

01:10:57.000-->01:11:02.625
f**king fall on it's face
there's no way it's gonna work
and we showed up on Friday and

01:11:02.625-->01:11:07.625
everything ran it was incredibly
smooth especially as far as CTFs
go um all the teams were

01:11:09.708-->01:11:14.833
attacking us all the teams were
patching stuff, everyone had
tooling, it was incredibly

01:11:14.833-->01:11:19.833
impressive so thanks everyone
yeah >>What was your- [applause]
>>Oh [inaudible] I don't know

01:11:32.208-->01:11:37.208
[inaudible] alright >>Okay so as
a it was elluded to um we are
also going to acknowledge the

01:11:40.042-->01:11:46.917
incredible hard work that uh
LegitBS has put in for five
years and so um not everyone

01:11:46.917-->01:11:52.167
knows this but we're going to
give all the ten core organizers
they will all get black badges

01:11:52.167-->01:11:57.167
>>Woo! [applause] Woooo! >>So
they have I believe they've ad-
helped advanced the state of

01:12:05.792-->01:12:10.542
capture the flag and just really
kept it true to what we want at
Def Con which is just a really

01:12:10.542-->01:12:17.292
offense defense driven head to
head combat kind of game and so
with that I really thank LegitBS

01:12:17.292-->01:12:22.292
and we're gonna rely on them to
help vet the next team that we
accept so thank you very much

01:12:24.375-->01:12:29.375
you guys just you guys knocked
it out of the park, thank you
[applause] Alright so we're

01:12:37.208-->01:12:42.875
gonna open a call for organizers
for Capture the Flag um we're
gonna do it in two weeks and

01:12:42.875-->01:12:48.667
we're gonna try to select an
organizing team before the end
of the year uh and we'll just

01:12:48.667-->01:12:52.625
like the last call for
organizers we'll provide a lot
of information you'll be able to

01:12:52.625-->01:12:57.625
interact ask questions with
LegitBS and past organizers um
and so uh we hope to really

01:12:59.917-->01:13:05.583
create the evolution of this and
so if you're interested or you
know people that are interested

01:13:05.583-->01:13:09.708
give some serious thought to
potentially organizing or
encouraging your friends to

01:13:09.708-->01:13:14.708
organize the next generation of
Capture the Flag. Alright what
is next, we thank them, we thank

01:13:17.292-->01:13:22.458
them, oh my super secret
announcement um before we do my
super secret announcement, for

01:13:22.458-->01:13:26.625
those of you who have been
coming for awhile I always save
my weird secret announcements

01:13:26.625-->01:13:31.875
for last just because you guys
are the most hardcore you've
waited the whole weekend you're

01:13:31.875-->01:13:36.708
probably exhausted and you're
just toughing it out and you're
supporting us and you're

01:13:36.708-->01:13:41.708
providing the energy and so I
always like to reward you with a
secret announcement [laughter]

01:13:47.125-->01:13:51.458
[applause] So one of the
announcements is everybody
always asks well how many people

01:13:51.458-->01:13:58.042
came, how big are we, like it's
some sort of contest um and it's
really hard for us to tell

01:13:58.042-->01:14:02.042
because um we don't really go
through all the numbers until
next week but we have some

01:14:02.042-->01:14:07.042
indicators and so I am guessing
at this point I was projecting
if you saw me on Twitter I was

01:14:09.917-->01:14:16.417
projecting a certain amount of
growth, I thought 6 percent, and
6 percent of a large number, is

01:14:16.417-->01:14:21.417
a large number, and we were at
about 20 percent >>Wow! >>Which
was pretty awesome and so we

01:14:26.042-->01:14:31.042
probably broke all in probably
about 25-->000 people >>Woo!
[applause] >>Right? So that's a

01:14:40.375-->01:14:45.750
lot of cats to herd um and I
wanna just invite CJ to come up
this is a new thing we're gonna

01:14:45.750-->01:14:51.042
start doing every year to just
give you a little bit of
transparency in what goes on

01:14:51.042-->01:14:56.042
behind the scenes just some
rough numbers with what we have
to deal with every year so CJ

01:14:59.500-->01:15:04.500
[applause] >>Alright thanks
everyone a big part of this is
for us keeping you guys safe is

01:15:12.292-->01:15:18.458
one of the most important things
we do. We take complaints about
harassment, we take people

01:15:18.458-->01:15:25.250
behaving badly really seriously.
We want to encourage people to
come forward and this idea of

01:15:25.250-->01:15:31.333
transparency is people have
asked us to be open about what's
going on so we're going to do

01:15:31.333-->01:15:35.792
that, we're going to show you
what kind of things we're
dealing with and we're going to

01:15:35.792-->01:15:41.125
welcome advice from the
community to try and improve
things. So this year out of

01:15:41.125-->01:15:46.125
25-->000 people we had 7 reports
of harassment, 9 reports of
medical uh situations and they

01:15:50.875-->01:15:55.875
ranged from someone who sprained
their ankle while skipping uh
[laughter] an unfortunately

01:15:58.917-->01:16:03.917
named person called Skippy
[laughter] there were 3 thefts,
1 vicious dog, 3 adorable dogs,

01:16:13.042-->01:16:19.417
5 cases of vandalism which
included some bright spark who
thought he could put a piece of

01:16:19.417-->01:16:25.458
paper on one of the Caesar's
palace walls and then write on
it with a Sharpie, guess what

01:16:25.458-->01:16:30.583
brainiac, it goes through.
Please don't do that again,
because Caesar's is going to

01:16:30.583-->01:16:37.292
hunt you down if you do. Uh
there was 2 cases of trespass on
property, these were people who

01:16:37.292-->01:16:43.125
decided to go back of house,
just like it's the most stupid
thing possible to go and hack an

01:16:43.125-->01:16:49.167
ATM on the casino floor because
it's got the most cameras on the
planet pointing at it, the same

01:16:49.167-->01:16:54.625
goes for back of house, they
have a lot of cameras there and
they recognize who's supposed to

01:16:54.625-->01:16:59.625
be there, it's pretty much a
fast track to being kicked out.
So the results of all of this,

01:17:01.708-->01:17:06.458
we had 4 people transported to
hospital, uh including one
person who had a large piece of

01:17:06.458-->01:17:11.458
masonry fall on his head, uh we
had 3 people who were banned for
life, and we had 2 people who

01:17:16.042-->01:17:21.042
were unbanned for life
[laughter] [applause] >>Woo!
>>We're gonna be changing things

01:17:28.583-->01:17:34.250
up a lot there's gonna be uh a
few new processes and a few
announcements over the next year

01:17:34.250-->01:17:40.667
about how we're gonna work to
make things more inclusive, more
safe and more diverse and one of

01:17:40.667-->01:17:45.667
the first things I want to start
with is please if you want to
help come apply to my team we

01:17:48.208-->01:17:53.042
are looking for all of you I
want this team the Goons the
guys in red shirts who run

01:17:53.042-->01:17:59.917
around as well as the staff at
Def Con who all run around to be
honest I want it to look like

01:17:59.917-->01:18:04.917
you, this team should represent
the community because the
community serves the community

01:18:07.667-->01:18:12.667
[applause] thank you! [applause
continues] >>Fantastic, okay, we
also have uh in years past, we

01:18:20.750-->01:18:26.542
used to try to run around and
calculate the amount of
donations that you all give to

01:18:26.542-->01:18:33.292
various groups and organizations
and nonprofits and this year
there were so many groups uh and

01:18:33.292-->01:18:39.375
so much fundraising just out of
your own pockets supporting the
causes that you wanted to

01:18:39.375-->01:18:45.958
support um that it was two hard
for us to get an aggregate
number about how much giving

01:18:45.958-->01:18:50.958
actually occurred but to Mark's
point about community, we really
are a community and I want to

01:18:50.958-->01:18:55.958
invite up one of the original
groups that we donated to, the
EFF uh Kurt and he's just gonna

01:18:58.000-->01:19:02.375
talk a little bit about this
process and how well the
community has been supporting

01:19:02.375-->01:19:04.375
them [cheering] >>Thank you,
thank you very much this has
been a- we're oh so glad to be

01:19:04.375-->01:19:10.375
back here in this community, it
is such a generous community and
this year has been an amazing

01:19:10.375-->01:19:15.375
year for fundraising, I want to
thank this community for
contributing people who came by

01:19:20.667-->01:19:25.917
the booth became members renewed
their memberships, got our
tshirts, got our stickers, those

01:19:25.917-->01:19:32.625
who contributed through the many
uh fundraisers like mohawk con
like buying the Benders badge

01:19:32.625-->01:19:38.667
like contributing through the
beard contest and so many other
fundraisers out there, this year

01:19:38.667-->01:19:44.625
has been our best year ever and
thanks to the generosity of this
community we have raised over

01:19:44.625-->01:19:49.625
113-->000 dollars [applause] we're
going to use to fight for your
rights online, we love you so

01:19:53.583-->01:20:00.250
much and we will see you next
year, thank you again. >>Right
on, thanks so much Kurt, right

01:20:00.250-->01:20:05.250
on. Okay so now we're into the
final stage boss round where um
I have made the decision to give

01:20:08.375-->01:20:13.875
you my super secret announcement
uh I've been agonizing over this
for awhile because it's kind of

01:20:13.875-->01:20:18.875
uncha- uncharted territory for
me and it's also uncharted
territory for Def Con and um you

01:20:22.208-->01:20:26.333
know I've been really thinking
about that that we're really a
global community and if you look

01:20:26.333-->01:20:31.833
I just raise your hand in the
audience or cheer or whatever if
you're not from the United

01:20:31.833-->01:20:38.250
States [cheering][applause]
right? And if you guys saw the
sign that was posted on

01:20:38.250-->01:20:44.125
Promenade level with the global
map and you saw where everybody
came from right? [cheering]

01:20:44.125-->01:20:48.708
>>Yeah! >>That was a brilliant
idea, right there, I want to get
a picture of that before you

01:20:48.708-->01:20:55.208
guys disappear because it is
amazing, I want a picture of
that. And it was a global map

01:20:55.208-->01:21:00.542
where people would mark where
they're from and I really
thought that you know it's

01:21:00.542-->01:21:07.125
getting harder and harder maybe
for people to come to the states
and we're and we're a global

01:21:07.125-->01:21:12.583
community and I've been thinking
about potentially growing Def
Con and I even um dropped a

01:21:12.583-->01:21:18.042
little hint in the program about
three years about we did a
Tribeca Film Festival and we

01:21:18.042-->01:21:23.083
brought the Hacking Villages to
a completely new audience,
filmmakers, and writers, and

01:21:23.083-->01:21:28.083
actors and we did that 2 years
in a row and it was amazing and
then last year we seriously

01:21:30.083-->01:21:36.250
investigated bringing the
Hacking Villages to another
country um and that really made

01:21:36.250-->01:21:42.417
me think that you know what I
should just try a beta event, I
should just try taking the kind

01:21:42.417-->01:21:47.875
of culture of Def Con the
Hacking Villages and going to a
new location and trying to build

01:21:47.875-->01:21:52.875
community and where would I do
that. So yeah we've we've got a
location and I'm gonna bounce it

01:21:55.833-->01:22:02.458
off you and you tell me what you
think of it but if I am- I am
finding incredible energy, I'm

01:22:02.458-->01:22:07.458
finding incredible creativity,
and no kidding I'm not joking,
I'm gonna try a Def Con beta in

01:22:10.417-->01:22:15.417
Beijing. >>Woo! [applause] >>And
you know if the hackers can't
come to us, the hackers will go

01:22:24.750-->01:22:30.833
to them. And we're gonna create
or help build and foster a
global community of these kinds

01:22:30.833-->01:22:35.833
of beliefs, of these open
exploration, the discovery, the
puzzle solving and uh and I

01:22:39.458-->01:22:43.333
could fall on my face and it
could blow up and it could be a
disaster or it could be an

01:22:43.333-->01:22:49.042
awesome beginning of a new
chapter. So we're gonna find
out, so if you're interested, if

01:22:49.042-->01:22:54.042
you run a contest or a village,
and you're interested maybe in
travelling overseas um or if

01:22:54.042-->01:22:58.917
you're a speaker and you think
you've got something up your
sleeve and you wanna go speak um

01:22:58.917-->01:23:04.000
you will see a call for papers
and call for contests in the
next couple of weeks so that is

01:23:04.000-->01:23:08.042
my super secret announcement
thanks for sticking around for
it and I'd love to get your

01:23:08.042-->01:23:13.042
feedback and with that I'd like
to call Def Con 25 to close.
[applause] Woo! >>Woo!

01:23:23.625-->01:23:27.375
[applause]
