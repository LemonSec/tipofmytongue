00:00:00.234-->00:00:05.239
>>Hi everybody uh, I'm Jason
Hernandez. Uh our talk is titled
tracking spies in the skies uh

00:00:07.374-->00:00:13.747
as you can see there, that's a
photo of a uh domestic
surveillance aircraft. Uh N496ww

00:00:13.747-->00:00:18.752
which uh, is an FBI aircraft. Uh
that was flying over the Phoenix
area over the last couple of

00:00:24.458-->00:00:29.463
years. Um, so again uh about the
talk our main focus is on um,
law enforcement and aerial

00:00:33.200-->00:00:38.205
surveillance mostly focus on
domestic flights. Um so the F,
FBI the DEA, um local uh

00:00:42.509-->00:00:47.514
sheriff's offices and police
departments. Um they're all
operating um fixed wing and, and

00:00:51.018-->00:00:56.023
helicopter aircraft. Um, with a
variety of technology. Um, Sam
Richards is gonna lead off uh

00:00:58.759-->00:01:02.629
with a little bit of discussion
of the history of aerial
surveillance and um the

00:01:02.629-->00:01:07.634
discovery of the FBI and DEAs um
secret fleets. Um, and then
Jerod MacDonald-Evoy is going to

00:01:11.238-->00:01:16.610
talk about some of the
technology aboard the aircraft.
Um and then I'll finish up and

00:01:16.610-->00:01:23.016
discuss uh, some algorithmic
ways to, detect aerial
surveillance um based on flight

00:01:23.016-->00:01:29.556
patterns. So, over to Sam.
>>Alright, well thank you again
everybody for coming out here.

00:01:29.556-->00:01:34.561
This is crazy. Um so I wanna say
right away that it's, this talk
it's a huge topic obviously with

00:01:38.065-->00:01:43.337
ya know tons of different
agencies and municipalities and
technologies, so this isn't

00:01:43.337-->00:01:47.975
gonna be all encompassing but
we're going to try to do uh it's
best justice we can to the

00:01:47.975-->00:01:54.781
topic. Uh so I guess for me it
started off a long time ago just
interested in all kind of

00:01:54.781-->00:02:01.021
conspiracies really. Uh the
closest one that you can think
of with this would be black

00:02:01.021-->00:02:05.792
helicopter conspiracy. So people
were suspecting some sort of
government activity with

00:02:05.792-->00:02:10.097
unmarked aircraft flying all
over the place, um nobody really
knew if there was actually

00:02:10.097-->00:02:16.203
something to it or not. And it
turns out that there was
interestingly enough. Um and so

00:02:16.203-->00:02:20.640
the first news report that kind
of caught my eye and a lot of
people's attention was from the

00:02:20.640-->00:02:25.645
Wall Street Journal. Uh just
like on a lot of these initial
reports it was just talking

00:02:25.645-->00:02:30.384
about 1 individual plane uh and
it was pretty obvious that you
could assume that it would be

00:02:30.384-->00:02:36.223
doing some sort of surveillance.
And then when Baltimore happened
with the Freddie B- uh Freddie

00:02:36.223-->00:02:42.129
Gray protest more people started
noticing just a single engine
Cessna uh circling at ya know a

00:02:42.129-->00:02:47.134
lot of times it was at night and
it was pretty obvious to assume
that that was monitoring the

00:02:47.134-->00:02:52.672
protest. Because the plane
wasn't there before that. And
again, with those articles it

00:02:52.672-->00:02:58.645
was just referencing 1 aircraft,
not nothing really confirmed um
ya know it wasn't ever

00:02:58.645-->00:03:04.685
acknowledges publicly by the
agencies that were operating the
aircraft obviously. And that's

00:03:04.685-->00:03:09.689
sort of when I started getting
involved. Um, yea. So, I've put
a story on medium.com uh

00:03:12.993-->00:03:18.765
initially I was just on my
Twitter account. Um I got a tip
from somebody I worked with at

00:03:18.765-->00:03:22.536
Minneapolis International
Airport, uh he just sent me a
screenshot from flightradar24

00:03:22.536-->00:03:27.908
and it showed just this plane
circling all kinds of like, I
think it was Southdale Mall in

00:03:27.908-->00:03:33.013
Minneapolis and other highly
populated areas. So we
immediately recognize that it

00:03:33.013-->00:03:37.584
was doing some sort of
surveillance there uh and we
just all open source

00:03:37.584-->00:03:44.124
information. We just pulled the
aircraft's registration up on uh
aircraft 1 dot com and from

00:03:44.124-->00:03:49.262
there, there was a list of 62
planes that had similar
registration so that plane in

00:03:49.262-->00:03:55.735
particular was registered to FVX
Research. Which doing just more
open source investigating you

00:03:55.735-->00:04:00.340
could see that, that wasn't a
real company. Um, they weren't
on any Secretary of State

00:04:00.340-->00:04:05.212
websites, there was no
legitimate business website or
anything like that. So, at the

00:04:05.212-->00:04:10.784
bottom of that first list we
found were 2 aircraft registered
explicitly to the Department of

00:04:10.784-->00:04:16.990
Justice. Not behind a front name
just explicitly DOJ. Uh those 2
planes were actually 737's. So

00:04:16.990-->00:04:22.295
not kind of aircraft that are
used for spy planes but still it
was, it was interesting to see

00:04:22.295-->00:04:28.401
that correlating right away. Uh
and then from there using just
the names of these companies we

00:04:28.401-->00:04:34.307
couldn't prove existed uh, I
just started searching all those
specific names like PSL Surveys,

00:04:34.307-->00:04:41.047
FVX Research, um Northwest
Aircraft Leasing CO is one of my
favorites. And putting those

00:04:41.047-->00:04:47.521
names into these little aircraft
registration websites the list
ballooned to over 100 aircraft

00:04:47.521-->00:04:53.193
and this was in May of 2015. So
I put that list on Pastebin uh
which I'm sure people are

00:04:53.193-->00:04:58.532
familiar with, it's just like a
website you can dump information
on and share it. Uh so at that

00:04:58.532-->00:05:04.905
same time I just put a little
brief, ya know write up, like
hashtag FBI sky spies, this is

00:05:04.905-->00:05:09.609
probably what's going on. Here's
some links to images from flight
radar where you can see these

00:05:09.609-->00:05:15.448
planes circling. Uh and it was
all over the country, like, the,
Seattle was really have at that

00:05:15.448-->00:05:20.554
time. But basically, anywhere
there was a metropolitan area
that's bigger, like bigger than

00:05:20.554-->00:05:27.127
a medium sized city. Um but also
rural places too, like remote
places. Greeley, Colorado

00:05:27.127-->00:05:33.200
outside of Denver was a really
small town that was popular with
the FBI at that time. And you

00:05:33.200-->00:05:39.673
can go next. So this was
basically my main concern with
these planes. Um, I knew about

00:05:39.673-->00:05:45.612
this program from a PBS
documentary. Basically the, the
drones in this case they, they

00:05:45.612-->00:05:50.350
patched together what are
equivalent to just a ton of
cellphone cameras and you make,

00:05:50.350-->00:05:55.021
you an image so large that you
actually just, you keep these
drones parked over for a long

00:05:55.021-->00:06:00.260
time and then you can see
everything moving including
people walking, cars and things

00:06:00.260-->00:06:06.933
like that. Uh and so in the in
the war efforts they were using
these to try and track down who

00:06:06.933-->00:06:10.971
placed an IED somewhere after
the bomb exploded. And they
would literally just review the

00:06:10.971-->00:06:16.176
footage and find where that
person went. And then presumably
the special forces or whatever

00:06:16.176-->00:06:23.016
would raid that house. And so
that, that was publicly known uh
developed by DARPA in the early

00:06:23.016-->00:06:27.420
2000s and that was, when I saw
planes flying over the country I
immediately thought of this

00:06:27.420-->00:06:34.127
technology. And so, that' that's
a huge fear obviously if you
have everybody in a city being

00:06:34.127-->00:06:38.565
surveilled with all their
movements being tracked. Um so a
little bit more on that

00:06:38.565-->00:06:44.738
technology after on probably,
but back to the stories. So,
after I put up my story on

00:06:44.738-->00:06:50.043
medium dot com with, it was just
like less than 1-->000 words. Um
the ai- the associated press

00:06:50.043-->00:06:55.548
broke that story into the
mainstream about a week later.
Uh and so those tweets with the,

00:06:55.548-->00:07:00.787
the flight tracking information
and the medium blog post were
going viral still. Uh so that

00:07:00.787-->00:07:06.559
was interesting. Uh they
actually linked to it in the AP
article initially. Uh they

00:07:06.559-->00:07:11.498
called it speculation, which
didn't really hurt my feelings
that much. But let's see here.

00:07:11.498-->00:07:16.503
So continuing on to the
research. Um we basically found
this office at the FAA's uh FOIA

00:07:19.439-->00:07:23.009
headquarters. And you can, you
can submit a ton of tail
numbers. They were actually r-

00:07:23.009-->00:07:27.881
incredibly responsive and
helpful. This one came from a
FOIA that I sent over 700 tail

00:07:27.881-->00:07:32.385
numbers to them. And they came
back with just a massive
spreadsheet and n- not much time

00:07:32.385-->00:07:38.425
at all. And uh you can kinda see
the basic info. Like the tail
numbers are highlighted. You see

00:07:38.425-->00:07:44.264
the dates. Um the airports,
cities that they took off and
landed at. But not, not a whole

00:07:44.264-->00:07:50.870
lot of information. Uh so y- you
don't see the circles or if it
was just a simple A to B flight.

00:07:50.870-->00:07:56.843
But you get a general idea. And
so that, that was helpful but
still sort of limited you know?

00:07:56.843-->00:08:01.915
If we're gonna go about trying
to investigate these things just
doing it manually on a flight

00:08:01.915-->00:08:07.120
radar website or doing it
through public records requests
it's very labor intensive. Um,

00:08:07.120-->00:08:13.560
and with 100s and 100s of these
aircraft which are actually
proliferating down from, you can

00:08:13.560-->00:08:19.399
hit the next one. Um, or maybe
the next one, we'll go back to
this one. SO you can see that

00:08:19.399-->00:08:24.437
these, these companies that are
making this technology it's, it
is an industry. It's

00:08:24.437-->00:08:30.243
surveillance industrial complex.
Uh initially everything starts
off with the war efforts it

00:08:30.243-->00:08:35.849
seems and then it eventually
percolates down from there from
federal to state to local. And,

00:08:35.849-->00:08:40.120
the bottom there it says, large
city law enforcement, medium
city law enforcement. That's a

00:08:40.120-->00:08:45.525
huge market share. So we're
gonna clearly see this type of
stuff continue to be, ya know

00:08:45.525-->00:08:52.065
even just some podunk sheriff
will eventually have a Cessna.
Um, with whatever capabilities

00:08:52.065-->00:08:58.071
so we need more people to look
into it. Cause you looking at
one plane, if you pull it up on

00:08:58.071-->00:09:03.410
flight radar, it you'll see just
a bunch of flights right? And
that's, that's obviously labor

00:09:03.410-->00:09:08.381
intensive so, I think people
need to start taking it um
taking it seriously. And kind of

00:09:08.381-->00:09:13.787
try to inquire more with whoever
is operating the aircraft in
their neck of the woods. Um so

00:09:13.787-->00:09:19.159
you want to go back to that
open? This is really interesting
to me. So this was actually made

00:09:19.159-->00:09:24.864
by homeland securities
geospatial intelligence team.
And you know you can see the red

00:09:24.864-->00:09:29.602
areas. I'm not sure how clear it
is on the screen over there but
that's where there was civil

00:09:29.602-->00:09:34.774
unrest. Uh the Freddie Gray
protest response basically. And
then they have all the other

00:09:34.774-->00:09:38.845
critical infrastructure that
they're interested in
protecting. But, so this this

00:09:38.845-->00:09:44.584
wouldn't' really be possible
without some sort of spy plane
over head. Uh you feed this down

00:09:44.584-->00:09:50.890
and obviously it's a huge
benefit for any law enforcement
or intelligence to have a pretty

00:09:50.890-->00:09:56.930
accurate and up-to-date map of
an entire city and all of the
activity at the time. Um, and

00:09:56.930-->00:10:01.935
then you wanna go and, yeah.
>>So uh, I've been looking into
um what the types of different

00:10:04.637-->00:10:08.274
aircrafts through public
records. And through public
records we've been able to and

00:10:08.274-->00:10:11.945
just watching ya know flight
radar we've been able to
determine what types of aircraft

00:10:11.945-->00:10:16.649
they use. The most common for
airborne aerial surveillance are
the small fixed wing Cessnas.

00:10:16.649-->00:10:20.854
It's like 1 engine prop plane
you probably have seen them
around. They're really popular

00:10:20.854-->00:10:26.526
with like flight schools or
private owners. Um but they'll,
they'll fly those around um all

00:10:26.526-->00:10:31.798
over. A lot of law enforcement
has those both local and state
and federal. Then the next type

00:10:31.798-->00:10:35.568
of aircraft, these large dual
engine beechcraft. It kind of
looks like this, this plane

00:10:35.568-->00:10:39.539
right here but instead of 1
engine up front it's got 2 on
each wing and it can hold about

00:10:39.539-->00:10:44.143
15 to 20 people. Now when they
got to the state legislator and
ask for money to buy these they

00:10:44.143-->00:10:47.780
usually say, oh it's going to be
for transport or things like
that or you know moving

00:10:47.780-->00:10:53.253
investigators around the state.
But they when you go through the
records you find that they do

00:10:53.253-->00:10:56.956
have surveillance equipment
installed on them as well. And
they're using these large engine

00:10:56.956-->00:11:01.794
planes um specially customs and
borders patrol has one that they
fly up and down the border

00:11:01.794-->00:11:07.100
almost daily uh around Arizona
and Texas. Just running
surveillance on the border

00:11:07.100-->00:11:10.703
picking up radio signals and
things like that. Then there's
the military style plane the

00:11:10.703-->00:11:15.842
Pilatus. Uh very, very few law
enforcement has these, have
these. Uh Phoenix PD is one of

00:11:15.842-->00:11:20.547
the early adopters uh that we
know of. And what's interesting
about these, this specific plane

00:11:20.547-->00:11:26.719
it's the Specter model which was
initially designed for the US
Air Force to fly uh and do

00:11:26.719-->00:11:30.290
surveillance in Iraq and
Afghanistan. Now the other
interesting thing about this

00:11:30.290-->00:11:35.662
plane is first it's the largest
1 engine prop plane you can buy
and it's also pressurized. Now

00:11:35.662-->00:11:39.933
if you have a pressurized cabin
you can go up way higher and
this plane is usually flying at

00:11:39.933-->00:11:46.306
around 17-->000 feet. Doing
circles um like 10 mile orbits
following some guy or, or

00:11:46.306-->00:11:51.778
looking at a residence. Um,
these are, these are becoming
more and more popular. This is

00:11:51.778-->00:11:56.015
about a 4.5 million dollar
aircraft though. So that the,
the larger cities are gonna be

00:11:56.015-->00:11:59.819
the ones that are gonna be more
interested in the Pilatus. But
the small wix- fixed wing

00:11:59.819-->00:12:04.424
cessnas, I mean there's not a
huge barrier to entry for those
for a lot of other local law

00:12:04.424-->00:12:09.862
enforcement because for example
the Mary Copen county sheriff's
office down in Arizona, they got

00:12:09.862-->00:12:13.900
one of their panes through Rico.
Uh because there was a guy who
was smuggling marijuana on a

00:12:13.900-->00:12:19.038
plane. They found him, took the
plane decided, hey let's use
this for our own uh benefit. So

00:12:19.038-->00:12:24.210
the other type of aircraft most
people are familiar with uh with
when it comes to police aircraft

00:12:24.210-->00:12:27.780
are helicopters, but they're
loud they're noisy, they've
gotta fly them low. They mainly

00:12:27.780-->00:12:33.519
use them for the guy who ran
away on foot. Or to survey like
a car accident. Now drones are

00:12:33.519-->00:12:38.291
still very new to law
enforcement. Not very many are
using them. Sheriff Joe out in

00:12:38.291-->00:12:43.930
Arpaio petitioned to try and get
a predator drone but that never
went through obviously. Thank

00:12:43.930-->00:12:48.501
goodness, um but uh eh, eh
there're other law enforcement
agencies that are getting like

00:12:48.501-->00:12:52.372
the quadcopters. They're saying
they're trying to use them for
search and rescue but we haven't

00:12:52.372-->00:12:56.242
really found any uh examples of
them being used for
surveillances yet and they're a

00:12:56.242-->00:12:59.812
little bit harder to keep track
of. But law enforcement are
getting a lot more interested in

00:12:59.812-->00:13:05.418
those especially with the ones
that are backpack deployable. Um
now equipment wise the most

00:13:05.418-->00:13:10.490
popular type of camera system
they're on practically all of
these air craft, is the Wescam

00:13:10.490-->00:13:16.496
by L3 Communications now um, the
Wescam is interesting, they have
3 different varieties. Uh they

00:13:16.496-->00:13:19.232
have the MX10, MX15, and MX20.
MX10 uh has like about a 70 time
zoom ratio. It's usually on like

00:13:19.232-->00:13:21.901
the helicopters, because the
helicopters don't have to go
very high. Uh MX15 is kind of an

00:13:21.901-->00:13:26.906
in between for your law
enforcement agency that can't ya
know spend 1.5 million dollars

00:13:30.610-->00:13:35.615
on a camera system. Um and then
the MX20 is though the most
popular. The MX20 is the same

00:13:38.951-->00:13:44.090
camera system that is used on
the predator drones. Um, they
have a laser designator where

00:13:44.090-->00:13:50.063
they can uh well on predator
drones the laser des- designator
is used for missiles. But on a

00:13:50.063-->00:13:54.267
law enforcement aircraft they
use that laser designator to,
say they're following a, a guy

00:13:54.267-->00:13:58.604
who stole a car. They lock it on
that car and then the camera
doesn't ya know, the operator

00:13:58.604-->00:14:02.375
doesn't have to worry too much
about moving it and they're just
doing zoom or changing the lens.

00:14:02.375-->00:14:07.046
Cause you can see it's got like
several different lens, lenses
here. And one of those lenses

00:14:07.046-->00:14:13.086
usually is an infrared camera.
FLIR or for looking infrared, um
the company that makes those is

00:14:13.086-->00:14:17.790
called FLIR and they're, they're
the most popular and FLIRs
interesting uh because it's

00:14:17.790-->00:14:23.963
basically, imagine predator
vision, that's what it is. It's
seeing heat. Um and it can

00:14:23.963-->00:14:27.667
actually see usually, it can
even see through walls and you
can see people walking inside a

00:14:27.667-->00:14:33.506
home with the, with their heat
signatures. But um there was a
supreme court ruling Danny Lee

00:14:33.506-->00:14:39.579
Kyllo vs the United States which
ruled that using uh infrared to
look into someone's home is, it,

00:14:39.579-->00:14:45.084
it requires a warrant. So this
guy he was, he was growing pot
in his house and police u looked

00:14:45.084-->00:14:48.221
into his house and saw there was
a lot of heat coming from the
garage and then they said to the

00:14:48.221-->00:14:51.390
judge oh we think that means
he's growing marijuana in there
and got a warrant. Well Danny

00:14:51.390-->00:14:55.328
Lee Kyllo and his attorneys
argued that the, the use of that
infrared technology to see into

00:14:55.328-->00:15:00.967
his home constituted a search.
Um, and so they won that and now
they, police have to get

00:15:00.967-->00:15:05.905
warrants to use infrared in
that, that type of way. But it's
hard to track to see how police

00:15:05.905-->00:15:09.942
are using that because a lot of
time cases that the aerial
surveillance is used on, um

00:15:09.942-->00:15:15.148
they'll seal the dockets. Now
cell site simulators are the
other ar- uh type of equipment

00:15:15.148-->00:15:19.619
that we know has been used on
these, these aircraft. The FBI's
done it at least twice that we

00:15:19.619-->00:15:23.923
know of. Now cell site
simulators, it's a little device
if you don't' know coactively

00:15:23.923-->00:15:29.262
they're called Stingrays or IMSI
catchers and they act like a
cellphone tower. So if there's

00:15:29.262-->00:15:33.332
one in this room right now
everyone's phone would go to
that instead of the cell tower.

00:15:33.332-->00:15:37.403
And they could scoop up the
data. Read metadata on the more
advanced versions they could

00:15:37.403-->00:15:41.908
even turn it into a passive
listening device. They get they
can follow where you're going um

00:15:41.908-->00:15:46.546
and it's a really popular
device. Um but if you can
imagine flying one of those

00:15:46.546-->00:15:52.151
above a city of 1.5 million or
so you're gonna be sweeping up a
lot of data uh from that plane.

00:15:52.151-->00:15:57.757
Now the fourth thing that we
have seen on these planes are
what they call LETC devices. Now

00:15:57.757-->00:16:03.362
this is a stupid little acronym
they like um that we found from
uh, from records. From FFA

00:16:03.362-->00:16:07.333
records, on, on their
airworthiness. They,
airworthiness records y- you can

00:16:07.333-->00:16:12.038
get, they're public record and
it shows everything that's been
installed on an airplane. Um and

00:16:12.038-->00:16:17.076
we found it on several the
aircraft it will say installed
LETC antenna. LETC stands for

00:16:17.076-->00:16:21.280
law enforcement technical
collection, um and when I
reached out to customs and

00:16:21.280-->00:16:25.184
border patrol about the, the
myriad of law enforcement
technical collection antennas

00:16:25.184-->00:16:29.155
they had installed on their
plane they said that they use
them to collect signals across

00:16:29.155-->00:16:34.894
the electromagnetic spectrum.
Well. [laughter] Electromagnetic
spectrums a pretty big place

00:16:34.894-->00:16:38.798
right? So I asked them about
that and they just said, no we
collect across the entire

00:16:38.798-->00:16:43.803
electromagnetic spectrum which
is ya know x-rays, gamma rays,
cell phones, everything. So what

00:16:43.803-->00:16:48.007
we can assume they are using it,
especially customs and border
po- patrol probably listen to

00:16:48.007-->00:16:53.212
drug runners with radios or cell
phones. Or even internet signals
could be picked up with an LETC

00:16:53.212-->00:16:58.918
uh antenna. Uh but that's one we
don't know a whole lot about
yet. Now some examples of use

00:16:58.918-->00:17:05.157
are um, uh one of the most well
known uh examples was when the
FBI flew their airplane in

00:17:05.157-->00:17:10.196
support of the Baltimore police
department during the uh Freddie
Gray protest. Uh this is a

00:17:10.196-->00:17:14.467
screenshot from that, they were
using IR uh and they were, they
circled I think the protest I

00:17:14.467-->00:17:19.071
think for like 8 to 10 hours
that day. Uh the released all
the footage after myself and

00:17:19.071-->00:17:22.008
several other reporters kept
bugging them about the footage
because we knew it was their

00:17:22.008-->00:17:27.013
plane. Uh so that's 1 example of
use even though the FBI publicly
said that they don't surveil

00:17:29.081-->00:17:33.185
protests, um but obviously, they
did here but they say that's
because they were in support of

00:17:33.185-->00:17:36.188
Baltimore police department and
they had asked for that. So
that's the other thing is the

00:17:36.188-->00:17:39.825
FBI will often lend this
aircraft out to the local law
enforcement that might not have

00:17:39.825-->00:17:45.898
it. Now another example was the
FBI also did some aerial
surveillance of uh this suspect

00:17:45.898-->00:17:51.737
um in Arizona who they believe
had been shooting a gun at cars
on the interstate 10 out there.

00:17:51.737-->00:17:55.975
They flew up and down the, the
freeway, followed him to his
work, circled his work then

00:17:55.975-->00:17:59.845
circled his apartment uh then
the next day they arrested him.
So we can assume that they were

00:17:59.845-->00:18:04.350
probably getting intelligence on
ya know how does he go into his
house, what does he drive, where

00:18:04.350-->00:18:08.421
is he driving, who is he seeing?
Before they went in with the
SWAT team and got him. Now

00:18:08.421-->00:18:13.326
phoenix PD recently used their
military style aircraft to
follow a guy who had stolen a

00:18:13.326-->00:18:19.065
U-Haul and led police through uh
the city. Um, and that's another
example of it being used. So

00:18:19.065-->00:18:23.769
it's even been used in, in
smaller crimes like that and not
just major investigations. Now

00:18:23.769-->00:18:29.342
the planes they use front
companies. Sam talked a lot
about that. The FBI, FBP, DOJ

00:18:29.342-->00:18:31.978
they're the main ones that use
front companies. Local law
Enforcement doesn't really do

00:18:31.978-->00:18:35.815
that. But we still don't' know
what's on those planes. But
there's a 10 dollar records

00:18:35.815-->00:18:39.552
request that I encourage
everyone here to do and we will
put a link to how to do this if

00:18:39.552-->00:18:43.389
you're curious about an
aircraft. It's 10 dollars, they
send you a CD the next week and

00:18:43.389-->00:18:47.827
it comes with the airworthiness
and registration history for the
plane for its entire history and

00:18:47.827-->00:18:51.197
you can look through and see
what's been installed you can
see it changing hands. An

00:18:51.197-->00:18:57.536
example is, this plane here uh
I'd saw it doing weird patterns
near the border and it belonged

00:18:57.536-->00:19:01.574
to this Global GEO Mapping Inc
who I couldn't find any
information on anywhere. They

00:19:01.574-->00:19:06.545
just had a PO Box registration
in Albuquerque. I get the
registration uh CD in the mail

00:19:06.545-->00:19:10.716
look in it, look at it,
literally the first page it
says, you know registrated,

00:19:10.716-->00:19:15.721
registration access, or address
PO Box in Albuquerque but
physical address Kirtland

00:19:15.721-->00:19:20.993
Airforce Base, customs and
border patrol. So you can, it's
pretty easy to find these planes

00:19:20.993-->00:19:25.264
once you kind of start learning
that um, but now they're getting
they're catching on and we have

00:19:25.264-->00:19:31.604
this problem with Delaware where
in Delaware you can register
your aircraft to uh like ev- the

00:19:31.604-->00:19:36.609
Delaware Corporation Commissions
Office uh and it just becomes a
black hole and you can't get any

00:19:36.609-->00:19:41.447
information. Uh for example the
Delaware Corporation Commissions
Office has over 2-->000 planes

00:19:41.447-->00:19:47.186
registered to that building. Um
including Google's Ash Floyd LLC
which is their front company for

00:19:47.186-->00:19:51.957
their drone program. Uh that
they're using to eh look at
using drones to deliver things

00:19:51.957-->00:19:57.263
or uh update their maps. And
they have about 10 hummingbird
drones registered to the

00:19:57.263-->00:20:02.034
Delaware Corporation Commissions
Office. Um so that's another new
trick that they're using. Now

00:20:02.034-->00:20:07.706
this video real quick, this is
of the Pilatus uh aircraft in
Phoenix following a guy who had

00:20:07.706-->00:20:12.678
stolen the U-Haul. You can see
there that the, they changed
lenses because they have about 3

00:20:12.678-->00:20:17.550
different lenses. They were
orbiting about 17-->000 feet 10
miles away. And as you can see

00:20:17.550-->00:20:22.621
um, it's pretty clear, you can
get in really close with this
camera and this is a very

00:20:22.621-->00:20:26.892
compressed version of the video
they gave me. So I imagine even
on, probably on their version

00:20:26.892-->00:20:30.863
the clarity is even better and
you can probably read the
license plate, see what state is

00:20:30.863-->00:20:36.202
on the side of the U-Haul and
what mural they have. Um and
right here you can tell that

00:20:36.202-->00:20:40.239
they're starting to designate
the U-Haul with the laser
designator there. In order to

00:20:40.239-->00:20:44.043
better track it. Um, now we're
going to skip forward just a
little bit here. See there they

00:20:44.043-->00:20:48.147
changed the lens again and in a
second here it will go to IR,
the infrared and so you'll get

00:20:48.147-->00:20:52.151
to see a little bit of what that
does. Not sure why they went to
IR on this, it was a clear day

00:20:52.151-->00:20:56.622
so, uh they might of just wanted
to get some good footage but you
can see that, you can see the

00:20:56.622-->00:21:02.995
heat from the, from the road
from the car, um and it's, it's
you can a lot of great

00:21:02.995-->00:21:08.434
information for them, or they
get a lot of great information
with that system. Um, now I'm

00:21:08.434-->00:21:15.107
gonna kick it over to Jason.
>>Um, hi everybody again. Um, so
we've discussed some ways to

00:21:15.107-->00:21:20.112
track down surveillance flights
by uh following the paperwork uh
documentation, registration, but

00:21:23.682-->00:21:30.623
I wanna look at how we more
generally detect surveillance
activity. Um, registrations can

00:21:30.623-->00:21:36.629
be changed and obscured. We're
seeing government agencies get a
little bit more clever about how

00:21:36.629-->00:21:41.634
they register aircraft and, and
use shell companies. Um, eh,
it's also um possible that

00:21:46.505-->00:21:51.544
contractors start to get more
involved in surveillance. Uh
some surveillance technologies

00:21:51.544-->00:21:58.083
are commercially available. Uh
as the technology improves more
and more will and you could see

00:21:58.083-->00:22:04.356
um corporations conducting more
surveillance, um you could ever
see wealthy private individuals

00:22:04.356-->00:22:10.362
funding and, and uh conducting
surveillance. Um and then
there's also kind of a, a big

00:22:10.362-->00:22:15.401
question we've, we've talked all
primarily about the United
States but um how much of this

00:22:15.401-->00:22:20.806
surveillance activity is
happening in other parts of the
world? Um, are agencies in the

00:22:20.806-->00:22:25.811
UK, in Europe, in other
developed countries, or, or even
uh the developing world

00:22:27.913-->00:22:32.918
conducting aerial surveillance
of this type? And uh, if they
aren't um when will then? Um, so

00:22:37.523-->00:22:44.296
I'm gonna discuss some, some
techniques to, to filter out
surveillance flights. Um based

00:22:44.296-->00:22:49.034
on taking advantage of knowledge
about the, the technical and
operational requirements that

00:22:49.034-->00:22:54.039
dictate relatively unique flight
patterns. Um, and as you can see
there, um that flight pattern

00:22:56.642-->00:23:02.581
doesn't look like somebody uh
going, going on a commercial
flight. That's um, kind of this

00:23:02.581-->00:23:08.387
odd cork screw patterns and then
you can see there's a really
heavily defined circle there and

00:23:08.387-->00:23:13.392
um whoever is at the center of
that circle should probably get
a lawyer. [off mic question]

00:23:17.763-->00:23:24.303
Possible. Yeah. [off mic
comment] Okay, um so the
question becomes how, how do we

00:23:24.303-->00:23:30.876
track aircraft. So as a hobbyist
or an individual radar is not a
practical way to, to track

00:23:30.876-->00:23:36.448
aircraft. But fortunately most
aircraft are equipped with
transponders that uh beacon a

00:23:36.448-->00:23:38.450
signal, uh with a unique
identifier that's uh actually
internat- internationally

00:23:38.450-->00:23:40.452
unique. Uh is- issued by the
International Civil Aviation
Organization. Um the protocol is

00:23:40.452-->00:23:42.454
called automatic dependent
surveillance broadcast or ADS-B.
Um and it's just how a beaconing

00:23:42.454-->00:23:47.459
signal. Uh and positions of
aircraft can be calculated uh
with the technique called

00:24:00.005-->00:24:04.943
multilateration. Uh that's where
you compare the time difference
of arrival for messages that um

00:24:10.649-->00:24:17.623
arrive at multiple receivers. Um
you need 4 or more receivers to
calculate positioning of a

00:24:17.623-->00:24:22.628
transmitter with
multilateration. Uh obviously
more receivers gives you a

00:24:22.628-->00:24:29.001
little bit better fix and better
data. Uh and there are some
websites and aggregator networks

00:24:29.001-->00:24:34.006
that collect feeds from ADS-B
receivers and uh calculate out
aircraft positions. Um some

00:24:36.675-->00:24:42.781
aircraft also transmit uh
additional information, they'll
transmit they're latitude and

00:24:42.781-->00:24:47.786
longitude as calculated by their
GPS unit, um squat codes, and uh
altitude. Um but we can't

00:24:51.724-->00:24:57.830
necessarily rely on the accuracy
of the uh positions transmitted
by the aircraft so uh

00:24:57.830-->00:25:04.403
multilateration is really
helpful in confirming that from
multiple sources. So, uh the

00:25:04.403-->00:25:09.408
question becomes how do we get a
hold of ADS-B data at scale? Uh
fortunately there's already a

00:25:13.078-->00:25:20.052
large and active community of
radio and aviation and hacking
enthusiast that collect ADS-B

00:25:20.052-->00:25:26.959
data and um send it to
aggregator networks. Um, all
that you need is a Raspberry Pi

00:25:26.959-->00:25:33.499
even your old model 1B that you
might have in the closet will
work. Um an RTL-SDR radio, which

00:25:33.499-->00:25:39.438
is a little software defined
radio you can buy one for 25
dollars uh over in the vendor

00:25:39.438-->00:25:45.844
area if they're not out. Um and
antenna of varying size and
quality um and an internet

00:25:45.844-->00:25:50.849
connection. And um so for under
100 dollars you can pick up uh
transmissions um from aircraft.

00:25:54.386-->00:25:58.924
And uh there are multiple
aggregator networks that collect
ADS-B data and, and calculate

00:25:58.924-->00:26:05.230
positions. Uh couple of the big
ones, Flightradar24 dot come and
Flightaware dot com. And I'll

00:26:05.230-->00:26:11.770
talk more about ADS-B exchange
dot com uh which is a bit
unique. Um and uh the FAA

00:26:11.770-->00:26:17.676
regulations require an
increasing number of aircraft to
transmit ADS-B, it's' just part

00:26:17.676-->00:26:24.450
of their next gen program to
revamp uh air traffic control
systems. So, by 20 20 most

00:26:24.450-->00:26:31.056
aircraft are uh supposed to be
equipped with ADS-B out. Um and
then there's similar regulations

00:26:31.056-->00:26:36.061
around the world um in the EU,
India, Australia, etcetera. Okay
but there are some challenges

00:26:40.666-->00:26:46.638
and limitations to the uh
availability data. Um, the major
commercial flight tracking sites

00:26:46.638-->00:26:51.643
augment their data with FAA
radar data. Um the FFA gives you
this data for free but you have

00:26:54.746-->00:27:00.652
to accept restrictions. And the,
and the restriction is that uh
tracking sites don't publish the

00:27:00.652-->00:27:06.825
positions of aircraft that are
on their block list. Um and any
aircraft owner can request that

00:27:06.825-->00:27:13.165
their aircraft be added to the
block list for free. Um and even
if the tracking site um is

00:27:13.165-->00:27:18.704
picking it up over ADS-B or some
other method, they're, they're
not allowed to publish it. Um so

00:27:18.704-->00:27:23.709
the commercial sites um, have
some restrictions there. Um,
also bulk access to data is uh,

00:27:26.678-->00:27:33.085
limited or expensive if you,
it's not practical to get all of
the data for all flights in real

00:27:33.085-->00:27:38.090
time from um these commercial
sites. Um but AD ADS-B exchange
is an exception. Uh they

00:27:41.093-->00:27:46.098
explicitly do not use FFA data
and they don't censor flights.
Um they also provide free access

00:27:48.200-->00:27:54.873
to live and historical data. Um,
I encourage anybody who uses
that data to, to donate to them.

00:27:54.873-->00:28:00.812
They don't endorse us but uh we
are big fans of their work, so.
So, um to pick surveillance

00:28:00.812-->00:28:05.817
flights out of that live
streaming data um, there there's
a bit of work that has to be

00:28:09.354-->00:28:16.128
done. Um, there are over 80-->000
flights a day. Uh the
uncompressed data coming from

00:28:16.128-->00:28:21.133
ADS-B exchange works out to
about 10 gigs a day. Um and at
any given time there's 8-->000 to

00:28:23.569-->00:28:29.942
13-->000 aircraft being tracked in
the air. Usually most of these
are not surveillance flights. Um

00:28:29.942-->00:28:36.882
and so the question becomes how
do we pick out the surveillance
flights? So, um looking at

00:28:36.882-->00:28:41.887
surveillance flights versus
other flights uh we know most
non-surveillance traffic goes

00:28:45.557-->00:28:51.964
from point A to point B as
quickly and efficiently as
possible. Um and commercial

00:28:51.964-->00:28:57.469
traffic and, and most other
traffic will try and minimize
flying over populated airspace.

00:28:57.469-->00:29:03.742
Populated areas um so commercial
airlines have noise
restrictions, they are not

00:29:03.742-->00:29:08.747
allowed to fly too low over
particular areas. Uh and then
furthermore uh if you're in a

00:29:11.783-->00:29:16.555
metro area there are lot of
different airports including
generally a large commercial

00:29:16.555-->00:29:21.960
airport and each of these
airports has their own ring
that's controlled air space at

00:29:21.960-->00:29:27.966
different levels. So, this is a
screenshot of um the airspace
around Phoenix Sky Harbor

00:29:27.966-->00:29:32.971
airport. Um and you can see that
bowtie pattern is the main, main
area of controlled airspace, um

00:29:35.974-->00:29:40.712
around the approach for the
runways of sky harbor. Uh and
there are different altitude

00:29:40.712-->00:29:46.618
indicators that show that you
can't fly below this range or
above this range without getting

00:29:46.618-->00:29:53.325
clearance from the tower. So,
that's um that's a hassle for,
for a leisure pilot or a

00:29:53.325-->00:29:59.898
commercial travel. They want to
get up and out of controlled
airspace um as quickly as

00:29:59.898-->00:30:04.903
possible and not have to go in
holding patterns, etcetera. So
and then we also know from um,

00:30:08.874-->00:30:13.879
some of the, the technical
information 'bout the equipment
on board there are technical and

00:30:15.947-->00:30:20.986
operational constraints for
running surveillance flights.
There's an altitude sweet spot

00:30:20.986-->00:30:26.324
in that if you're flying too low
you're going to make noise and
you're going to be much more

00:30:26.324-->00:30:32.030
noticeable. Um you also have to
deal with controlled airspace
from smaller regional airports,

00:30:32.030-->00:30:37.035
um terrain, uh other challenges.
On the other side of the coin um
most of these aircraft are not

00:30:39.604-->00:30:44.976
pressurized and so they can't
really get much higher than
10-->000 feet and they're not, not

00:30:44.976-->00:30:49.981
built for that. Um, they also
would have to deal more so with
uh airspace, controlled airspace

00:30:52.484-->00:30:57.489
from, from the major commercial
airport in the area. Um and then
just as 1 example, piece of

00:31:00.425-->00:31:07.032
equipment um cell site
simulators, um have a range of
approximately 2 miles in a metro

00:31:07.032-->00:31:12.671
area. Um according to some
documents published by the
intercept that may improve a bit

00:31:12.671-->00:31:18.076
but it gives you a good
guideline in terms of um range.
And if the aircraft is too high

00:31:18.076-->00:31:24.516
you're going to limit that range
on the ground geometrically. Um
also surveillance flights

00:31:24.516-->00:31:30.155
typically take off and land at
the same airport. It just would
get more costly and more

00:31:30.155-->00:31:35.127
impractical if you were trying
to schedule surveillance flights
between different airports and

00:31:35.127-->00:31:40.132
um so for example in Phoenix uh,
the FBI uses the Deer Valley
airport, uh which is

00:31:42.200-->00:31:48.039
conveniently about 5 to 10
minutes away from the field
office there. Um, furthermore

00:31:48.039-->00:31:54.279
most surveillance is interested
in people that live in densely
populated metro areas. So, these

00:31:54.279-->00:32:01.019
flights are going to be
corkscrewing around um over
cities, not going straight from

00:32:01.019-->00:32:06.024
ya know Las Vegas to New York,
etcetera. And then there's some
other, other aims, so aircraft

00:32:08.360-->00:32:14.900
capabilities. Certain aircraft
fly too fast it wouldn't' be
practical to use a 737 to

00:32:14.900-->00:32:19.704
conduct surveillance over, over
a city because it just would
move too quickly you wouldn't

00:32:19.704-->00:32:26.478
have much dwell time over the
city, aside from costs. Um, but
then the aircraft can't be too

00:32:26.478-->00:32:31.983
small because they need to
generate enough power or carry
uh batteries to operate this

00:32:31.983-->00:32:37.422
relatively energy hungry
surveillance equipment. Um they
also need to be large enough to

00:32:37.422-->00:32:42.427
carry these relatively large
surveillance pods. So, um,
there's kind of a, a sweet spot

00:32:44.830-->00:32:49.835
in terms of size of aircraft as
well. So, um with some of that
information being considered um,

00:32:54.105-->00:33:00.979
I've worked on just a prototype
of a, a surveillance score. So,
where you look at the behavior

00:33:00.979-->00:33:05.984
of aircraft and you um try and
thin it out as surveillance or
not surveillance. Um, the main

00:33:08.186-->00:33:14.726
metric that I'm using is just
calculating 90 degree turns um
so that's where, where the

00:33:14.726-->00:33:20.498
heading of the aircraft changes
more than 90 degrees and each
time that happens you, you just

00:33:20.498-->00:33:27.305
increment the score. Um, most
commercial traffic is going to
only have a couple of turns,

00:33:27.305-->00:33:33.812
maybe to make final approach.
Um, and that's all conditional
based on altitude so again we,

00:33:33.812-->00:33:40.085
we know that there's generally a
sweet spot for, for altitude so
um, turns and activity that are

00:33:40.085-->00:33:46.524
in that, that range are scored
higher. Um, lower flying flights
might be somebody in a flight

00:33:46.524-->00:33:52.797
school that's practicing
takeoffs and landings. Um,
higher up it might be a, a

00:33:52.797-->00:33:59.638
commercial jet that's um in a
holding pattern before coming
in. So, and then there's some,

00:33:59.638-->00:34:04.576
some a lot of other uh angles
to, to further improve uh
detection. So considering the

00:34:07.379-->00:34:13.485
proximity to airports and
controlled airspace might help
filter out more, um more flight

00:34:13.485-->00:34:18.490
schools. Uh and then uh scoring
based on the aircraft model,
again we, we have a pretty good

00:34:21.126-->00:34:27.565
idea there, there's a good list
of aircraft that are popular for
surveillance and, and well, well

00:34:27.565-->00:34:34.339
built for that purpose. And so
scoring those higher is, is
another angle to, to highlight

00:34:34.339-->00:34:40.812
uh surveillance activity. Um,
also I think that uh it's
suspicious to request that your

00:34:40.812-->00:34:47.652
plane be on the block list and
so I would highlight those as
interesting, uh potential

00:34:47.652-->00:34:52.290
surveillance aircraft. Um a
little bit more geometry might
help to filter out survey

00:34:52.290-->00:34:57.295
activity which can sometime
trick, trip this um basic turn
counting. Um and then uh

00:35:01.733-->00:35:07.172
comparing flights to interesting
geography will, will also
highlight uh surveillance

00:35:07.172-->00:35:12.177
activity. So, for example Jerod
found some flights that went, uh
up and down along the Arizona uh

00:35:14.679-->00:35:19.684
US Mexico border. Um so
highlighting the border as a
interesting geographic area uh

00:35:23.488-->00:35:30.028
will help, help to uh pick out
surveillance flights because
there's not really any other

00:35:30.028-->00:35:36.067
reason that somebody is going to
fly the length of the US Mexico
border. Um also events like

00:35:36.067-->00:35:41.072
protests, uh the Freddie Gray
protest, the protests at the
shooting of Jamar Clark, Dakota

00:35:44.142-->00:35:49.147
access pipeline protest. We've
all seen aerial surveillance and
so some scoring of, of those

00:35:52.183-->00:35:57.188
interesting areas might be
another angle to, to highlight
and uh spot spy planes. So, just

00:35:59.958-->00:36:04.963
looking at, at that crude metric
of counting the number of 90
degree turns. Um, most flights

00:36:09.667-->00:36:15.440
with 30 or more turns look like
surveillance flights. In that
when you start to dig into the

00:36:15.440-->00:36:21.212
paperwork you look where it's
registered, you look at
airworthiness documents um a

00:36:21.212-->00:36:26.217
large share of those aircraft
are surveillance. Um so this is
just an example screenshot of a

00:36:28.753-->00:36:33.758
uh, aircraft over Baltimore
during the Freddie Gray protest.
So, um the prototype code that

00:36:37.729-->00:36:42.734
I'm going to release after the
talk is um, takes data um, in a
real time live stream from ADS-B

00:36:49.240-->00:36:54.245
exchange and it um, holds it
into virtual radar server. Um
ADS-B exchange has a real-time

00:36:59.784-->00:37:04.723
API. Um that, that V- VRS works
this. And virtual radar server
then provides a JSON endpoint

00:37:08.593-->00:37:14.466
that you can grab bye snippets
from. Um the reason why I'm
using that angle is that um

00:37:14.466-->00:37:21.239
ADS-B exchange also offers
historical data that's in that
same JSON format. So in the

00:37:21.239-->00:37:27.579
future could take that
historical data and um use
pretty much the same methodology

00:37:27.579-->00:37:33.718
and work on refining the score
and uh spotting historic
surveillance events. Um, so

00:37:33.718-->00:37:38.723
that's just loaded into a queue
um split across multiple threads
that can be uh, distributed

00:37:40.859-->00:37:47.365
across multiple machines so
that's helpful. Um, should 1
start to analyze um a large

00:37:47.365-->00:37:53.605
archive of historical flight
data you spin out virtual
machines and uh just kind of

00:37:53.605-->00:38:00.411
crank through it. And then
that's all queued up. Um it's
composed in redis which has some

00:38:00.411-->00:38:06.818
really nice geo hashing
features. Um and uh the
surveillance flights are dumped

00:38:06.818-->00:38:11.823
out as JSON files into uh, a web
map so you can look at it on the
web. And see these aircraft are,

00:38:15.560-->00:38:22.467
are highlighted as surveillance,
or suspicious at least. Um and
then it also um archives the

00:38:22.467-->00:38:27.472
files into mongoDB so you can do
some geo queries and, and look
at it um further. And do

00:38:30.775-->00:38:35.980
retrospective analysis. So maybe
uh the surveillance score
algorithm you want to improve it

00:38:35.980-->00:38:42.520
and tweak it and the reprocess
all of your old data and see if
anything else falls out. Um so

00:38:42.520-->00:38:47.525
that's the idea there. And this
will all be open source. The um,
the white boxes are, are code

00:38:52.230-->00:38:58.770
that I'm releasing. Um, so
here's an example, screenshot
of, of the web map uh this is

00:38:58.770-->00:39:04.776
actually a very new aircraft. It
was purchased by the California
highway patrol uh circling over

00:39:04.776-->00:39:09.781
the Sacramento area. You can see
uh it kind of does some, some
loops and corkscrews and then it

00:39:12.450-->00:39:18.089
goes around different areas. I
think this might actually be um,
looking for speeders. Uh I

00:39:18.089-->00:39:21.859
don't' know if anybody's driven
through California and they have
these signs, speed monitored by

00:39:21.859-->00:39:26.864
aircraft. I didn't really
believe it until um, looking at
the data a bit more. So, um. So,

00:39:29.500-->00:39:34.505
um if you're interested in this
and wanna work on tracking spy
planes there are a lot of things

00:39:38.109-->00:39:43.114
you can do. Um, it's pretty easy
to set up an ADS-B receiver for
less than 100 dollars. Um a good

00:39:46.284-->00:39:52.857
little weekend project and feed
data to ADS-B exchange dot com.
Um, you can donate to ADS-B

00:39:52.857-->00:39:57.862
exchange um they don't endorse
us but uh you can also donate to
us. Um, the code will be open as

00:40:00.698-->00:40:06.137
well so you can use fork and
improve the application. It's
still very much a prototype but

00:40:06.137-->00:40:11.142
um it does highlight interesting
planes. Um, so if you have
questions um, or wanna see more

00:40:13.645-->00:40:18.650
information you can go to our
website uh we're gonna have a,
um some links and article up uh

00:40:21.819-->00:40:26.824
hopefully later today once we
get online. Um and links to
Github soon. Thank you. Um.

00:40:33.498-->00:40:38.002
