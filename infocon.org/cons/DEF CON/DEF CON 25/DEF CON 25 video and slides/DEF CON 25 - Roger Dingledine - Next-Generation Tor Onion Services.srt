00:00:00.042-->00:00:06.125
>>So, the first rule of onion
club is you - oh, oh s**t, wrong
talk, Okay, so I'm going to tell

00:00:06.125-->00:00:11.083
you a little bit about, uh, Tor
Onion services and the sorta
things we've been doing lately.

00:00:11.083-->00:00:16.208
I'm gonna try and do a bunch of
different topics at once. Um,
how many people here know about

00:00:16.208-->00:00:22.542
Tor or how it works? Some, like
awesome. Okay. So, I'm going to
skip over most the the how it

00:00:22.542-->00:00:28.250
works and so on, um, we finally
made the projector work - which
is awesome, I can't see what I'm

00:00:28.250-->00:00:33.542
seeing, so I'll be looking at
the sides every so often. So Tor
is a non-profit, Tor is

00:00:33.542-->00:00:37.458
software, Tor is a privacy tool,
Tor is a lot of different
things. It's a network of

00:00:37.458-->00:00:42.500
volunteers around the world. Um,
it's a group of researchers who
try to study how to make privacy

00:00:42.500-->00:00:48.250
better. The Tor network has
something like 2 million users,
every day using it, so it's a

00:00:48.250-->00:00:53.250
lot of different people all
around the world. We've got a
lot of people in, uh, the middle

00:00:53.250-->00:00:57.583
east, We've got a lot of people
in Europe, we've got a lot of
people in North America and each

00:00:57.583-->00:01:02.917
of those are for a lot of
different reasons that I can get
into. So, what's the - what's

00:01:02.917-->00:01:07.542
the situation here? We've got
Alice over here, she's trying to
browse the web to some bob and

00:01:07.542-->00:01:12.042
she wants to, um, keep some
security properties. She wants
to stay safe. She wants to make

00:01:12.042-->00:01:16.542
it so that somebody watching her
doesn't know where she is going.
She wants to make it so that

00:01:16.542-->00:01:20.500
someone at the destination end
can't see where she's coming
from. And she wants to make it

00:01:20.500-->00:01:26.875
so no single, like tier one ISP,
is like AT&T, which I guess
means NSA, um [laughter from

00:01:26.875-->00:01:33.417
audience] get to track, uh,
where she's coming from to where
she's going. So anonymity is

00:01:33.417-->00:01:38.458
more than just encryption, more
than just scripto. I talk to a
lot of corporations, to say,

00:01:38.458-->00:01:43.667
yeah, I don't need Tor because,
I-I use a VPN. I don't need Tor
because I-I've got encryption, I

00:01:43.667-->00:01:49.042
use, I use something else. And
encryption is good. You should
use encryption, but even when

00:01:49.042-->00:01:52.083
you're using encryption, people
watching you get to learn who
you're talking to, when you're

00:01:52.083-->00:01:58.375
talking to them, how much you're
talking, and that's what the
intelligence agencies use these

00:01:58.375-->00:02:03.500
days. It's not about 'let's try
to break the crypto' it's about
'let's build a social graph of

00:02:03.500-->00:02:08.167
who's talking to who, find out
who's in the middle of that and
then go break into their house

00:02:08.167-->00:02:12.417
and change their laptop or steal
their hardware ot stuff like
that'. So that gal of Tor is to

00:02:12.417-->00:02:16.625
protect the metadata, um i'm
sure you've all heard the phrase
' we kill people based on

00:02:16.625-->00:02:23.292
metadata' from our fine
government. Okay, so I actually
only use the word anonymity when

00:02:23.292-->00:02:27.542
I'm talking to other
researchers. When I'm talking to
my parents and ordinary people I

00:02:27.542-->00:02:31.458
tell them i'm working on a
privacy system. Because
anonymity...maybe it's a bit

00:02:31.458-->00:02:36.708
scarey, but privacy is a good,
is a good value that the whole
world should have. And when I'm

00:02:36.708-->00:02:41.958
talking to companies, Google and
Walmart and so on, i tell them
I'm working on communication

00:02:41.958-->00:02:48.125
security. Because privacy is
dead, and anonymity is scarey,
but security - yeah, yeah, I

00:02:48.125-->00:02:53.333
need some security. And then
when I'm talking to governments
and militaries I tell them I'm

00:02:53.333-->00:02:57.750
working on traffic analysis
resistance communication
networks. [laughter from

00:02:57.750-->00:03:01.917
audience]. And again, it's the
same system, it's the same
network, it's the same set of

00:03:01.917-->00:03:05.875
users, it's the same security
properties, but but the goal is
to blend all of these different

00:03:05.875-->00:03:09.500
groups together. Because when
you go to the government and say
I got a security tool, they're

00:03:09.500-->00:03:14.625
like 'yeah, I've heard that one
before, we fifty security tools,
we're, we're all set or we don't

00:03:14.625-->00:03:19.625
like security' or whatever their
answer is, um but traffic
analysis resistance, 'oh yeah, I

00:03:19.625-->00:03:25.792
do want to send the diplomat in
Israel and not have people learn
what her affiliation is.' And

00:03:25.792-->00:03:29.292
then there's the fourth
category, which is the
reachability, um of the

00:03:29.292-->00:03:34.083
censorship side. So all of these
is different talks. Er, I'm
gonna skip over most of them.

00:03:34.083-->00:03:38.375
Er, I should be around for the
rest of the weekend in bright
green shirt, so, if you wanna

00:03:38.375-->00:03:42.625
ask me more questions about Tor,
um I should be around. Okay, so
how how do you build one of

00:03:42.625-->00:03:48.417
these? The easy answer is, uh,
you have single hot proxy, um
all of the users show up, um and

00:03:48.417-->00:03:52.875
they each request whatever
website they're going to. And
this is bad news for a couple of

00:03:52.875-->00:03:57.875
reasons. The main reason is that
big juicy center target. So I
was actually talking to the CTO

00:04:00.125-->00:04:05.000
of one of these companies years
ago, i think it was anonymizer
dot com, and he said, 'yeah, we

00:04:05.000-->00:04:10.750
never answer subpoenas, if we
ever answered a subpoena, nobody
would trust us again. So of

00:04:10.750-->00:04:15.042
course we never answer them.'
And then I was doing a talk for
the US department of Justice,

00:04:15.042-->00:04:19.333
like 6 months later, and one of
them interrupted me and said,
"why can't you be like

00:04:19.333-->00:04:24.625
anonymizer, it's easy, we send
them a subpoena, they send us an
answer, it's easy, why can't you

00:04:24.625-->00:04:28.750
be like that...' [laughter from
the audience] so, I don't say
that to pick on anonymizer in

00:04:28.750-->00:04:33.167
particular, the problem is the
architecture. The problem is the
centralized system where they

00:04:33.167-->00:04:38.583
have all of your metadata, they
know exactly what you're doing
and they promise not to screw

00:04:38.583-->00:04:44.708
you. They could screw you, they
got everything, they promise not
to. I want a system that's based

00:04:44.708-->00:04:51.083
on privacy by design, based on
distributed trust, rather than,
there's a centralized system and

00:04:51.083-->00:04:54.417
they make some promises and
there's no way for you to tell
whether they're following

00:04:54.417-->00:04:59.958
through. Okay, and it's actually
worse than that, because if it's
a centralized system, there's

00:04:59.958-->00:05:04.958
one cable going into the
computer, same cable coming out,
and if you can tap that cable or

00:05:04.958-->00:05:10.042
the upstream or the upstream's
upstream, ah, then you get to do
pretty simple traffic analysis -

00:05:10.042-->00:05:15.708
you can say: 'this flow came in
and a very similar looking flow
went out, so I'm pretty sure

00:05:15.708-->00:05:21.250
this user is talking to that
destination.' So, the goal of
Tor is to distribute the trust

00:05:21.250-->00:05:26.875
over multiple relay so there's
no single point that gets to
learn about Alice and Bob in the

00:05:26.875-->00:05:31.875
same circuit. Ok, so far so
good? Great. So that's actually
only half of what Tor is. The

00:05:34.333-->00:05:40.083
first part i was telling you was
the location privacy or um
network metadata or something

00:05:40.083-->00:05:46.250
like that. The other half is
the, the browser side. The
application level privacy. So,

00:05:46.250-->00:05:51.583
in your browser there's so many
different ways, um, um awesome,
i hope my slides continue to

00:05:51.583-->00:05:56.750
survive as people mess with
them. Um, so in your browser
there's so many different ways

00:05:56.750-->00:06:02.833
to screw up from the privacy
side, um, cookies, HTTP headers,
uh, I hear Flash is finally

00:06:02.833-->00:06:09.292
dead, that's awesome, um so, one
of the things we do is, fork a
FireFox called that tries to

00:06:09.292-->00:06:14.958
keep all of those other things
from messing you up. So it tries
to, uh, tries to isolate all of

00:06:14.958-->00:06:20.750
your state when you close to a
browser it all gets thrown away,
um so that's uh, um a second

00:06:20.750-->00:06:24.542
thing that we work on and I'm
not going to talk about that one
here, except to mention that

00:06:24.542-->00:06:30.250
it's an important piece of
things. Okay, so here's a graph
of the performance, uh, of the

00:06:30.250-->00:06:35.917
the scalability, the the
bandwidth of the Tor network
over the past, uh, 7 years or

00:06:35.917-->00:06:40.750
so. So the green line is the
capacity of relays in the
network, we're up to about 8000

00:06:40.750-->00:06:46.042
relays and the purple line is
the load on the network - which
is the people who are using it

00:06:46.042-->00:06:50.833
for um going into Facebook or
going into CNN or going into
WikiLeaks or whatever they're

00:06:50.833-->00:06:55.708
doing with Tor. So, there are a
couple of interesting things
here. One them is the more the

00:06:55.708-->00:07:01.083
gap is between the green line
and the purple line, the faster
a Tor can be. So we were

00:07:01.083-->00:07:07.083
discovering this long ago, in
fact my last talk at Defcon was
8 years ago and it was entitled

00:07:07.083-->00:07:13.375
'Why Tor is slow and what we're
going to do about it' and you
can see on this graph where that

00:07:13.375-->00:07:20.292
talk was given. So that was at
the zero zero point in this
graph and since then, we've

00:07:20.292-->00:07:26.875
moved up to, uh, something like
100 gigabits of actual traffic
and maybe 2 or 3 times that

00:07:26.875-->00:07:31.292
capacity. So they're a lot of
relays out there around the
world, uh, including run by a

00:07:31.292-->00:07:36.250
lot of people here (you should
all run relays) um in order to
make the Tor network, um, be

00:07:36.250-->00:07:41.500
able to handle more traffic. And
it's not just that, it's also
the diversity side of things, um

00:07:41.500-->00:07:46.500
it's not just about being able
to handle bandwidth, we need to
have a lot of different relays

00:07:46.500-->00:07:51.625
in a lot of different places
around the world so that a
single attacker, maybe French

00:07:51.625-->00:07:56.250
Intelligence or something like
that won't, won't be able to see
enough places on the internet in

00:07:56.250-->00:08:00.917
order to be able to manage that
person in going into the Tor
network and this flow is coming

00:08:00.917-->00:08:06.083
out and i can see them both, so
I can match them up. So, one
piece of the diversity is the,

00:08:06.083-->00:08:11.333
the diversity of relays, where
they are, the other piece the
diversity of users. So, if we

00:08:11.333-->00:08:17.625
had a an anonymity system for
cancer survivors and everybody
on it was using it to talk

00:08:17.625-->00:08:22.625
about, uh, how they survived
cancer, then the fact that you
have Tor installed would give

00:08:22.625-->00:08:27.208
people a really good hint about
why you have Tor installed. So
one of the really important

00:08:27.208-->00:08:32.417
pieces of the security is having
a lot of different types of
users, so we need Egyptian

00:08:32.417-->00:08:37.417
activists and cancer survivors
and Feds and Russian Feds, or
whatever the equivalent is - all

00:08:39.500-->00:08:44.125
in the same system so that you
can't guess what's going on just
from the fact that they're using

00:08:44.125-->00:08:49.750
Tor. Er, and another piece of
that is, uh, imagine there are
50 000 people in a run, like in

00:08:49.750-->00:08:55.083
Tor right now, the average
person in a run using Tor is
using it because somebody blocks

00:08:55.083-->00:08:58.833
their web comics, somebody
blocked Facebook and they want
to be able to look at their cute

00:08:58.833-->00:09:03.667
cats or something like that.
It's not that's there 50 000
dissidence in a run all trying

00:09:03.667-->00:09:07.125
to take down their government
using Tor, they're all trying to
be ordinary people on the

00:09:07.125-->00:09:13.167
internet and their country is
censoring them. So the fact that
most of them are ordinary is is

00:09:13.167-->00:09:18.375
a key piece of the strength of
Tor. You can't have an anonymity
system that is full of

00:09:18.375-->00:09:24.042
dissidence, uh, you need a lot
of other coer traffic and a lot
of other people blending. Okay,

00:09:24.042-->00:09:29.042
another, um key point:
Transparency for Tor, the Tor
project is a key property. So,

00:09:31.250-->00:09:35.750
one piece of that is, it needs
to be open source, it needs to
be free software and other

00:09:35.750-->00:09:40.542
pieces, we need the actually
give you the design documents
and specifications and say, um,

00:09:40.542-->00:09:45.250
this is what we meant to build,
this is how we thought we built
it, here's the source code,

00:09:45.250-->00:09:49.042
here's the design document,
please look at whichever of
those you're most comfortable

00:09:49.042-->00:09:54.458
with and try to find, uh, bugs
and mistakes and so on. Um,
another piece is, publically

00:09:54.458-->00:09:59.917
identified developers. So here
we are up here saying, "hi, I
work on Tor" There are - raise

00:09:59.917-->00:10:04.458
your hand if you're a Tor
developer or a Tor researcher,
or um something like that in

00:10:04.458-->00:10:09.250
here? We see a couple of hands -
awesome. So there are quite a
few people here, who are, uh,

00:10:09.250-->00:10:14.167
who are a part of the group of
people building Tor. And,
another piece of this, I get, I

00:10:14.167-->00:10:18.792
get a lot of people who say,
"oh, ha ha the anonymity people
are identifying themselves, ha

00:10:18.792-->00:10:24.292
ha they're so stupid," um,
privacy is about choice. Privacy
is about giving people the

00:10:24.292-->00:10:29.417
ability to choose, "Am I going
to publish this information
about me or not," and we believe

00:10:29.417-->00:10:35.583
that the best way to build a
strong global anonymity system
with a community around it is we

00:10:35.583-->00:10:41.250
choose to identify ourselves and
we choose to to describe uh, who
we are and what we're doing in

00:10:41.250-->00:10:46.250
order for you to be able to
trust us. Okay, and yes, there
are bad people in the world, um

00:10:48.667-->00:10:54.167
and some of them use Tor, but at
this point with millions of
people using Tor everyday, the

00:10:54.167-->00:10:59.333
average Tor user is the average
internet user. These are people
around the world who read about

00:10:59.333-->00:11:04.833
the NSA or their country blocked
Facebook and they wanna be able
to be internet users just like

00:11:04.833-->00:11:09.708
everyone else. So, yeah, you
could look at it as a two-edged
sword, you could say, you gotta

00:11:09.708-->00:11:15.208
take the good with the bad, or
something like that, um but what
really - imagine two scenarios.

00:11:15.208-->00:11:20.250
Scenario 1: I want to build a
tool that works for millions of
people. I want to tell you all

00:11:20.250-->00:11:25.417
about it, so you can help me
analyze it, and i want it to
work for the next year or two.

00:11:25.417-->00:11:30.167
So that's the Tor problem.
Scenario 2: I want to build a
tool that works for the next 2

00:11:30.167-->00:11:35.417
weeks. Only 10 people will use
it. And i'm never going to tell
you about it. That's the um

00:11:35.417-->00:11:40.333
terrorist, the bad guy problem.
So the bad guys have so many
more options. It doesn't have to

00:11:40.333-->00:11:45.500
scale, it doesn't have to have
peer review, it doesn't have to
-to be sustainable, whereas the

00:11:45.500-->00:11:50.583
Tor goal is to build something
that works for everybody and can
continue to work and can push

00:11:50.583-->00:11:55.208
forward, understanding how to
build privacy tools in the
world, because there a lot of

00:11:55.208-->00:12:00.042
really big well funded
adversaries out there, and we
the security community, need to

00:12:00.042-->00:12:05.667
learn how to build things that
can defend against them. Okay,
so another piece i wanted to

00:12:05.667-->00:12:10.333
talk about, uh, if they're, if
you're only learned about Tor
from slash dot or some, uh, some

00:12:10.333-->00:12:15.750
crappy newspaper article, um
there are a lot of people who've
been um, spreading memes over

00:12:15.750-->00:12:20.542
the last while and I want to
tackle a couple of them here,
um, not to try to like change

00:12:20.542-->00:12:25.708
your mind about something, but
many of you are Tor activists,
so hopefully this will help you,

00:12:25.708-->00:12:30.500
when you go talk to your parents
or your cousins or something and
they say, "Well, I heard that

00:12:30.500-->00:12:34.875
Tor..", uh, so hopefully this
will give you some ammunition
back. So one of the exciting

00:12:34.875-->00:12:39.250
things I hear, um, I heard the
navy wrote Tor so how can we
trust it? The very short answer

00:12:39.250-->00:12:44.250
to that is: I wrote Tor, not the
navy. So, here I am. [applause
from the audience]. And the

00:12:52.458-->00:12:56.542
other piece of that, so years
ago I was at a hacker conference
in the Netherlands called What

00:12:56.542-->00:13:00.667
the Hack, and I did three talks
in three days, and I got a lot
of people coming up to me

00:13:00.667-->00:13:04.958
saying, "How can we know we can
trust this thing?" and I got to
try two different answers on

00:13:04.958-->00:13:08.958
them. The first answer was,
"it's open source, it's free
software, you can look at it,

00:13:08.958-->00:13:13.375
you don't have to trust me, you,
you can decide for yourself if
it's safe". And they actually

00:13:13.375-->00:13:17.833
didn't like that one, 'cause I
think some of them heard, "It's
bad news, you should look at it,

00:13:17.833-->00:13:21.917
I can't tell you." The other
answer that I tried was, "No
dude, don't worry about it, it's

00:13:21.917-->00:13:25.917
fine." And that worked great.
Which [laughter from the
audience] it shouldn't have

00:13:25.917-->00:13:30.333
worked. It should be that we
should teach people about free
software and open source, um, so

00:13:30.333-->00:13:36.542
we've got some more work to do
in that world. Ok, so myth
number 2, um, I heard the NSA

00:13:36.542-->00:13:43.500
runs half the relays. First of
all, Ed Snowden's documents
showed us the GSQ ran like 5

00:13:43.500-->00:13:49.542
relays for like a week on amazon
EC2 some years ago. So, indeed,
some intelligence agencies have

00:13:49.542-->00:13:54.000
run relays every so often. But I
actually know like, the people
who run like two thirds of the

00:13:54.000-->00:13:59.208
relays, by by capacity, so I
know that the NSA does not run
half the relays, 'cause i know

00:13:59.208-->00:14:03.917
the people who run the relays.
But, so so that's one answer.
Another answer is: it doesn't

00:14:03.917-->00:14:08.833
make any sense for the NSA to
run the relays. Um, this is
maybe a sort of a a bad news

00:14:08.833-->00:14:14.750
answer, but they shouldn't run
the relays. They should continue
to monitor the internet and they

00:14:14.750-->00:14:18.708
should let excited and
enthusiastic people run relays
and then they're already

00:14:18.708-->00:14:24.167
watching AT&T and Deutsche
Telecom and the cables
underneath the oceans. Um, so

00:14:24.167-->00:14:27.875
they don't have to run the
relays to attack the Tor
network. They're already

00:14:27.875-->00:14:33.000
investing in surveilling the
internet, so it makes no sense
for them to try to go through

00:14:33.000-->00:14:38.417
the red tape and so on, uh, of
getting some feds to approve
running relays in the network.

00:14:38.417-->00:14:42.333
So, that one's kinda
complicated, um, but I don't
think there are many actual

00:14:42.333-->00:14:48.625
intelligence agencies running
relays because they don't have
to. Okay, so, um, myth number 3:

00:14:48.625-->00:14:54.208
I heard Tor is slow. If you used
Tor 15 years ago, it actually
was kinda slow. Er, but because

00:14:54.208-->00:14:58.750
we got a lot more capacity and
network these days, it's become
a lot faster than it used to be.

00:14:58.750-->00:15:03.292
So i talked to a lot of people
who last used Tor, you know 10
years ago or something, um try

00:15:03.292-->00:15:08.583
it out, if you haven't tried it
lately. And, um I heard, Tor
gets a lot of it's money from

00:15:08.583-->00:15:13.958
the US government. This one, is
alas, true. We get something
like 80 percent of our funding

00:15:13.958-->00:15:19.250
from, erm the US state
department or the national
science foundation, or the open

00:15:19.250-->00:15:23.583
technology fund which is part of
Radio Free Asia, um so there are
a bunch of different groups.

00:15:23.583-->00:15:28.792
We're diversified inside the US
government, um that's not as
much as I'd like to be. So we

00:15:28.792-->00:15:33.583
have something like 15 percent
of our funding coming from
donations and things like that

00:15:33.583-->00:15:38.250
and we'd love to grow that so
that we're more sustainable and
don't have to keep coming up

00:15:38.250-->00:15:42.375
with, um shiny things to try and
convince some funder that that
they want to pay for us to

00:15:42.375-->00:15:48.917
build. Okay, um another exciting
one, a few years ago there was
some researcher who came up with

00:15:48.917-->00:15:53.667
some bad methodology to measure
how much Tor is bad people and
then some journalist

00:15:53.667-->00:15:58.958
misunderstood it and like like
wrote a bad article about it and
before we knew it there was a US

00:15:58.958-->00:16:05.208
like, uh, department of justice,
uh, high muckety muck who was
saying in front of congress 80

00:16:05.208-->00:16:11.458
percent of Tor users are are
doing bad things. And every step
of that chain was bad news. Um

00:16:11.458-->00:16:16.333
another I guess, it's another
way of looking at that, Akamai
wrote another report a while ago

00:16:16.333-->00:16:21.917
looking at the people who were
going to, uh, Macy's or whatever
companies that that Akamai hosts

00:16:21.917-->00:16:27.208
and they found that the number
of people buying things over Tor
successfully and being ordinary

00:16:27.208-->00:16:33.042
people was the same rate as
people buying stuff over not
Tor. So, that was the argument

00:16:33.042-->00:16:36.667
they were using to tell all
their customers, "yeah you
shouldn't be scared of the Tor

00:16:36.667-->00:16:41.458
thing, now that it has millions
of people it is a cross section
of the internet. It looks like

00:16:41.458-->00:16:47.500
everybody else." And then, myth
number 6: I shouldn't use Tor,
because if I do that the NSA is

00:16:47.500-->00:16:53.583
going to watch me. Um, so
[laughter from audience]. On the
one hand, um, a few years ago we

00:16:53.583-->00:16:58.708
actually found some xkeyscore
rules that the NSA might be
operating where they were spying

00:16:58.708-->00:17:03.500
on my computer and T and
tracking all of the connections
that came to it. Um , on the

00:17:03.500-->00:17:08.750
other hand, so imagine your
friend comes to you and says, "I
heard that when I use HTTPS the

00:17:08.750-->00:17:13.750
NSA is watching me, so i'm not
going to use encryption anymore
and now I'm gonna be safe,"

00:17:16.083-->00:17:20.125
[laughter from the audience]
that that's crazy talk. The same
thing's happening here, NSA is

00:17:20.125-->00:17:24.667
watching everything, they're
already building databases of
everything going on - and if you

00:17:24.667-->00:17:29.750
say ' well, I'm not gonna use
any security tools because then
I'll be safe..." somehow we have

00:17:29.750-->00:17:35.542
to get to the world where Tor is
normalized enough that people
think that it's totally crazy to

00:17:35.542-->00:17:40.625
say 'I'm not gonna protect my
metadata because if I protect my
metadata then then they'll be

00:17:40.625-->00:17:45.625
watching me. They're watching
everybody. Okay, and then myth
7: um, a lot of people look at

00:17:48.583-->00:17:52.708
Tor and say, "Well, I read an
article 4 years ago that said
there was an attack so I'm I'm

00:17:52.708-->00:17:58.667
scared, I'm going to use the
crappy single VPN instead. So
part of the challenge here is

00:17:58.667-->00:18:04.667
teaching people about the
security system ecosystem. So,
you build a tool, somebody else

00:18:04.667-->00:18:09.917
figures out how to attack it,
you build a defense for that
attack, you go back and forth

00:18:09.917-->00:18:14.958
and then that's how systems
become stronger. That's how
systems become safe to use, if

00:18:14.958-->00:18:19.792
you design a thing and anytime
it's broken you throw it out and
start with a new one, you're

00:18:19.792-->00:18:24.375
never going to get anywhere. So
part of what we need to do is
help the world understand how

00:18:24.375-->00:18:29.375
the security ecosystem works.
Okay, so I'm going to talk here
about, uh, Onion services, um

00:18:31.625-->00:18:37.000
and what they are so far and um
and what we're doing to make
them stronger and and change

00:18:37.000-->00:18:43.000
them. So here's a screenshot of
using Tor browser to go to blah
blah blah dot onion which is one

00:18:43.000-->00:18:47.875
of the Onion services that
riseup uses. So that blah blah
blah is the hash of the public

00:18:47.875-->00:18:53.917
key for the Onion service. So
every Onion service is it's own
private key pair and you address

00:18:53.917-->00:18:59.500
them using the public key. So
what do you get out of this? One
of the really cool things is

00:18:59.500-->00:19:05.875
they're self-authenticated. If I
go to that public key address my
Tor client makes sure i'm really

00:19:05.875-->00:19:10.333
talking to the Tor on the other
side that's running that
address. So there's no man in

00:19:10.333-->00:19:15.125
the middle, uh, there's no
certificate authority mafia
telling us who can have

00:19:15.125-->00:19:20.167
encryption and who can't have
encryption. Ah, it's all built
into the system. Um, you get end

00:19:20.167-->00:19:24.708
to end encryption out of that,
um built in nab punching is
awesome. There are a lot of

00:19:24.708-->00:19:29.917
people who run Onion services
behind their firewall, no
packets are allowed through the

00:19:29.917-->00:19:35.125
firewall at all, it's just you
can go in through the Onion
service which build a connection

00:19:35.125-->00:19:39.708
out and that way your surface
area is really limited. Ah, for
example there are a lot of

00:19:39.708-->00:19:45.458
people who run, uh, Onion
addresses for their SSH server
and that way they can connect

00:19:45.458-->00:19:50.208
back to their computer but
nobody else can connect and
send, you kow, standard IP

00:19:50.208-->00:19:55.125
packets, you can't send weird IP
packets you can only talk to the
computer through the Onion

00:19:55.125-->00:20:00.125
channel - and that gives you
authentication and encryption
and and a lot of other good

00:20:00.125-->00:20:05.250
stuff. So that's, that's one of
the neat, that's a bunch of the
neat things that Onion services

00:20:05.250-->00:20:11.000
can provide. We we looked a
while ago at, uh, there's, at at
same time the journalist was

00:20:11.000-->00:20:15.833
saying that bad like 80 percent
thing - we were thinking: let's
actual try and figure out which

00:20:15.833-->00:20:21.292
fraction of traffic in the Tor
network has to do with Onion
services, because if you read,

00:20:21.292-->00:20:23.958
you know, the BBC articles about
Silk Road, you would think Tor
is only Silk Road, ah, so let's

00:20:23.958-->00:20:25.958
actually, you know, measure Tor
and try and figure out what's
going on, how much traffic there

00:20:25.958-->00:20:32.208
is. So we instrumented the Tor
relays in a way that,er, is
privacy preserving and safe.

00:20:32.208-->00:20:37.208
Tried to figure out how much
total traffic each relay kept,
oe uh, handled that was related

00:20:42.083-->00:20:47.500
to Onion services and here's a
graph over the past, uh, two and
half years or so and it's about

00:20:47.500-->00:20:52.583
a gigabit per second of Onion
traffic. So that's something
like 1 percent, uh, of the

00:20:52.583-->00:20:56.750
traffic I was showing you
before, but actually the math is
a bit more complicated because

00:20:56.750-->00:21:02.250
we were just measuring in the
middle, in three hops so, um so
the very short version is

00:21:02.250-->00:21:09.000
something like 3 percent of Tor
traffic has to do with Onion
services at all. So the other 97

00:21:09.000-->00:21:15.042
percent of the traffic is people
going to ordinary websites like
CNN and WikiLeaks and, uh, cute

00:21:15.042-->00:21:19.333
cat pictures and so on -
whatever people do on the
internet. So that's, that's a

00:21:19.333-->00:21:25.333
really important point because
it means...So I wrote Onion
services back in like 2004 or

00:21:25.333-->00:21:29.750
something. I wrote them for like
a toy to show that once you have
Tor you can build blocks on top

00:21:29.750-->00:21:34.958
of it - and they basically still
are a toy. They've got a couple
of early adopters. A lot of

00:21:34.958-->00:21:40.125
people who are, who are early
adopters for any technology tend
to be, uh, bad guys in one form

00:21:40.125-->00:21:45.292
or another, but part of what we
need to do here is get a lot
more users and a lot more people

00:21:45.292-->00:21:51.000
thinking about it because the
broader it gets the more
ordinary it becomes. So,

00:21:51.000-->00:21:55.708
whenever you see, uh,
journalists and so on trying to
show you the picture of the deep

00:21:55.708-->00:22:00.708
web, I have to wave my hands
whenever I say 'deep web' or um
'dark web' think about what

00:22:00.708-->00:22:05.625
they're trying to sell you
because there's there's
basically no dark web, it

00:22:05.625-->00:22:10.583
basically doesn't exist. Er,
there's a company out there
called Terbium labs that found

00:22:10.583-->00:22:15.792
like 7000 websites on the dark
we total compared to the
billions of pages out there and

00:22:15.792-->00:22:20.000
other places. So whenever
someone shows you the picture of
the iceberg try to figure out

00:22:20.000-->00:22:25.208
what their incentives are, what
are their motivations. Okay, so
what are some cool user cases

00:22:25.208-->00:22:30.292
for Onion services? Er, in terms
of, um other things people have
done with it. One of the really

00:22:30.292-->00:22:36.542
cool ones is SecureDrop. This is
basically a way of interacting
in a back and forth way with

00:22:36.542-->00:22:40.583
journalists, where say you've
got some story about some
terrible thing the government

00:22:40.583-->00:22:44.667
did and you want to get it in
the hands of the New York Times
or the Washington Post or the

00:22:44.667-->00:22:49.208
Intercept,er, and, so that they
can write a good article about
it, but you want to stay

00:22:49.208-->00:22:53.917
anonymous. So, um there are
actually like all those places
that i just named are actually

00:22:53.917-->00:22:58.583
running SecureDrop instances.
The New York Times has one, the
Guardian has one. There are like

00:22:58.583-->00:23:04.625
30 major newspapers that have
these whistleblowing platforms
as ways that you can reach them

00:23:04.625-->00:23:10.500
safely with built in encryption
and built in authentication in a
way that, uh, nobody's going to

00:23:10.500-->00:23:16.000
be able to man in the middle it.
So, that's an awesome first
step. Another,er, out of the box

00:23:16.000-->00:23:22.417
approach is a tool called
ricochet.So how many people here
use Jabber or XMPP or GoogleTalk

00:23:22.417-->00:23:29.333
or, uh, some words like that? I
see, uh, far fewer hands than I
expected, you're probably all

00:23:29.333-->00:23:34.417
Skype users. Okay, um [laughter
from the audience]. So one of
the really cool things about -

00:23:34.417-->00:23:38.875
one of the really sad things
about the centralized tools like
Jabber, is there's a central

00:23:38.875-->00:23:44.375
server where all of the traffic
goes through that server and if
you're in the middle you get to

00:23:44.375-->00:23:49.208
learn all the friends lists and
whose talking to who and so on.
So one of the cool things about

00:23:49.208-->00:23:56.042
ricochet is every user is their
own Onion service, so there's no
middle. I can talk to someone

00:23:56.042-->00:24:00.375
else's Onion service, I don't
have to know who they are who
where they are, i just need

00:24:00.375-->00:24:05.292
their Onion address. And now
there's nothing to tap if you
want to do European styled data

00:24:05.292-->00:24:10.708
retention, there's no place to
go to - if you wanna do like
American style, I'm just going

00:24:10.708-->00:24:15.500
to break in and take all the
data, uh, there's nothing to
break into. So there's no middle

00:24:15.500-->00:24:21.750
which is uh, an awesome, um
metadata security for chat.
There are a lot of the uh,

00:24:21.750-->00:24:26.000
signal, yay signal, but um
there's still like a computer in
Europe that moxy gets to look

00:24:26.000-->00:24:31.292
at, and it's probably not just
moxy. So, we really need to
think about metadata security,

00:24:31.292-->00:24:37.500
uh, for our communications apps.
Okay, another cool one is Onion
Share. This was actually written

00:24:37.500-->00:24:44.333
by journalists for journalists
at the Intercept and, so, let's
imagine you have um um um um 2

00:24:44.333-->00:24:49.042
gigabyte file, you got it from
some guy named Ed at the NSA and
you want to give it to the

00:24:49.042-->00:24:55.375
journalist next to you. Do you
use DropBox? Do you use a USB
key? Do you email it to them? Do

00:24:55.375-->00:25:00.292
you set up an FTP server? All
those are crappy answers. So
Onion share is a way to use

00:25:00.292-->00:25:06.417
Onion services, where the
website spins up for just that
one download. You fetch the file

00:25:06.417-->00:25:11.542
over the Onion address - the
website goes away. So, it's up
for just the transfer and then

00:25:11.542-->00:25:17.000
it's gone and there's nothing
left over afterwards. So that's
uh, a really important way of

00:25:17.000-->00:25:23.000
more safely, um sharing files
when you need to share important
files. And there are a bunch of

00:25:23.000-->00:25:27.417
other websites out there that
have set up their own Onion
addresses, uh, in order to let

00:25:27.417-->00:25:32.208
their user choose what sort of
security they get. Er, one of
the ones I think is especially

00:25:32.208-->00:25:38.708
awesome is the debbie packaging
system, when you do when you get
an app upgrade, um, they have

00:25:38.708-->00:25:43.417
Onion addresses for their
package servers. So that means
that you can get end to end

00:25:43.417-->00:25:47.833
encryption and authentication
when you're fetching your
updates, and um anonymous

00:25:47.833-->00:25:53.917
updates is an awesome concept.
So imagine right now you go to
get your next debian update and

00:25:53.917-->00:25:58.750
they're looking at you, like,
him yeah I want to give him the
exploit. Imagine you're going

00:25:58.750-->00:26:03.542
through Tor - they don't know
it's you. It's a bunch of
anonymous people doing updates,

00:26:03.542-->00:26:07.583
they can't target particular
people because they can't -
there's nothing recognizable

00:26:07.583-->00:26:12.292
about them. It's all just a
massive anonymous people
fetching their updates and if

00:26:12.292-->00:26:16.708
they want to target somebody
they have to target a lot of
them making it much more likely

00:26:16.708-->00:26:21.833
that somebody is going to notice
that they're that they're being
sent a bad package or an exploit

00:26:21.833-->00:26:25.792
or something like that. So i
think we should, we the security
community really need to think

00:26:25.792-->00:26:31.042
more about anonymous updates in
general, uh, because the
targeting problem seems like a

00:26:31.042-->00:26:36.042
really big one. Okay, so, what
do you think the biggest website
on the dark web is? If you've

00:26:39.708-->00:26:45.167
been reading like BBC or
something it's probably you know
Silk Road, um, turns out, the

00:26:45.167-->00:26:50.583
largest website you can reach
with an Onion address is
Facebook. [laughter from

00:26:50.583-->00:26:56.292
audience] Facebook set up Onion
address in order to let their
users choose, do I use the

00:26:56.292-->00:27:01.125
normal HTTPS mafia, do I use the
Onion address so that I don't
have to deal with that. Imagine

00:27:01.125-->00:27:04.792
you're in Turkey and you're
trying to go to Facebook, but
the Turkish government is

00:27:04.792-->00:27:09.500
actually attacking you, and
Turkish telecoms owns a
cer-certificate authority so,

00:27:09.500-->00:27:15.458
they actually do target people
by signing SSL certificates...so
Facebook wanted to give users

00:27:15.458-->00:27:19.167
around the world the choice of
what kind of security they're
getting - and the Facebook

00:27:19.167-->00:27:24.792
people, this is actually post
from Facebook, on their blog,
saying last April, uh, I guess,

00:27:24.792-->00:27:29.792
2 Aprils ago now, um a million
people logged into Facebook over
Tor in that month. So a million

00:27:32.500-->00:27:37.500
people is a lot, but they have,
I don't know, a billion users or
something? So point one percent

00:27:37.500-->00:27:42.500
of Facebook's user base logged
in over Tor last April? That's
huge. That's that's that's a lot

00:27:44.750-->00:27:49.500
more people than we were
thinking was using Tor. That's a
lot more ordinary people than we

00:27:49.500-->00:27:54.875
were thinking. So part of the
thing to realise here, uh, is
this is a cross section of the

00:27:54.875-->00:27:59.875
world that's using Tor at this
point. Okay, so how do these
things actually work? Um, so ,

00:28:02.250-->00:28:08.583
uh, imagine I'm Bob, I wanna run
some service, uh, some website
or something and i want people,

00:28:08.583-->00:28:13.417
people to be able to reach it as
an Onion address. So the first
thing I do is I generate my key

00:28:13.417-->00:28:18.958
pair and I establish circuits
out into the Tor network so
that, uh, and then I hold them

00:28:18.958-->00:28:24.458
open - those are my introduction
points. And at that point, I'm
going to publish a descriptor in

00:28:24.458-->00:28:29.417
the, the database in the sky
(I'll talk about that in a bit),
um and the goal of that is, I

00:28:29.417-->00:28:33.208
want to put my introduction
points, all three of them, and i
want to put the public key for

00:28:33.208-->00:28:39.750
my for my service , and then
Alice is going to learn blah
blah blah dot Onion somehow and

00:28:39.750-->00:28:44.125
she's going to pull that down
for the the directory, and now
she knows the introduction

00:28:44.125-->00:28:48.958
points and she knows the public
key so she can verify she's
really reaching the right place,

00:28:48.958-->00:28:53.208
um and at that point she's going
to establish her own circuit
into the Tor network, to what we

00:28:53.208-->00:28:58.042
call the rendezvous point, and
then she's going to send it an
intr- introduction to the

00:28:58.042-->00:29:03.000
introduction points, saying,
'hey I want to talk to Bob' and
it will get passed through to

00:29:03.000-->00:29:07.583
Bob and then Bob will receive a
message saying 'somebody wants
to talk to you and they're

00:29:07.583-->00:29:12.250
waiting over at this rendezvous
point, and here's a cookie for
how you can recognize each

00:29:12.250-->00:29:17.375
other. So then Bob is going to
connect to the rendezvous point
also, and at that point they do

00:29:17.375-->00:29:21.375
the handshake, so they get end
to end encryption and
authentication and in the last

00:29:21.375-->00:29:25.250
step they just talk to each
other through the rendezvous
point. So they're a bunch of

00:29:25.250-->00:29:29.708
cool things here. One of the
really important ones is that
rendezvous point doesn't know

00:29:29.708-->00:29:35.750
who Alice is, doesn't know who
Bob is. It's being used once for
this transaction and then it

00:29:35.750-->00:29:40.708
gets thrown away. So it doesn't
-basically, it it knows nothing
about what's going on, ah for

00:29:40.708-->00:29:45.833
that individual transaction.
Okay, so I talked about the
database in the sky - how does

00:29:45.833-->00:29:52.042
that actually work? Each Onion
service publish picks- six of
the Tor relays each day and it

00:29:52.042-->00:29:56.958
publishers its descriptors to
that six. So it uses this hash
function to try to map to which

00:29:56.958-->00:30:01.958
ones. The reason it needs to use
the hash function is the Tor
hidden service, Tor Onion

00:30:01.958-->00:30:08.042
service needs to be able to
predict where to publish it, so
that the clients can do the same

00:30:08.042-->00:30:13.542
calculation and fetch it from
the same place. So the service
publishes to these six places,

00:30:13.542-->00:30:17.875
the client fetches from one of
the six and then it can do that
dance I was talking about

00:30:17.875-->00:30:22.875
before. So far, so good? Okay.
So, what are some problems with
the old design? Er, one of the

00:30:25.333-->00:30:30.625
really big problems is, uh,
those old addresses are too
short and they're built with bad

00:30:30.625-->00:30:35.625
news keys. So the the simple
phrase is: it's the first 80
bits of the sha one of the 10 24

00:30:37.792-->00:30:44.208
bit RSA. every single word in
that sentence is bad news. So
[audience laughter] in fact

00:30:44.208-->00:30:48.958
there's a talk in here in this
room next, uh, about finding a
collision with sha one. So, uh,

00:30:48.958-->00:30:53.958
we need to fix most of those
pieces and the the very short
answer is, the new Ed 2 59 keys

00:30:56.167-->00:31:00.542
are stronger, safer, they're
based on elliptic curve, but
they're not based on the nist

00:31:00.542-->00:31:05.750
curves, so things are a lot
better in that shape. One of the
down sides though used to be

00:31:05.750-->00:31:10.333
that the Onion addresses are
really short and simple and the
new ones are 56 characters long.

00:31:10.333-->00:31:15.417
But the plus side is, you
actually get the key, the whole
key, it's not the hash of

00:31:15.417-->00:31:21.708
anything, that's actually the ED
2 55 19 key in that lower Onion
address. So that gives - that

00:31:21.708-->00:31:27.000
let's us do some cool stuff with
crypto that I'll talk about in a
bit. Okay, so what are some

00:31:27.000-->00:31:32.542
other problems? I talked earlier
about how each Onion service
picks six relays to publish to,

00:31:32.542-->00:31:38.250
that hash function I was talking
about is predictable into the
future. So, i can say, 'I want

00:31:38.250-->00:31:43.458
to target this particular Onion
address, so I'm gonna spin up 6
relays that have just the right

00:31:43.458-->00:31:49.500
identity keys so that next
Tuesday, I'm the 6th it's going
to choose," and at that point I

00:31:49.500-->00:31:54.042
can sensor connections to it
because somebody tries to fetch
a descriptor, I say, ' oh no

00:31:54.042-->00:31:58.708
I've never heard of it, it's
down, it's gone' Or I can
measure the popularity where

00:31:58.708-->00:32:03.333
people are going to have to go
through me in order to to fetch
the descriptor, so I can just

00:32:03.333-->00:32:08.167
count how many people do that. I
can't denominize it, I can't
attack it in that way, but it's

00:32:08.167-->00:32:14.000
still kinda bad news. Um, and in
fact, there there was like a
researcher at, I think it was,

00:32:14.000-->00:32:19.083
uh, Black Hat Amsterdam, or
something, who made 6 relays
that were going to be the 6

00:32:19.083-->00:32:24.042
relays for Facebook, like a
month or so after that, so
people have been doing this in

00:32:24.042-->00:32:29.333
practice, we've been noticing
that relays pop up that have
really close together identity

00:32:29.333-->00:32:34.500
key hashes for reasons that, I
mean, maybe it's the maybe it's
something else. So, so far we've

00:32:34.500-->00:32:38.625
been kicking those relays out,
but that's a crappy arms race.
So, the better way is to, um

00:32:40.792-->00:32:45.167
[pause], I'll take your question
at the end I hope. Um, so the
better way is to be able to

00:32:45.167-->00:32:51.250
change it and the way to change
that is to add another input
into that hash function which

00:32:51.250-->00:32:56.917
changes every day. So, it needs
to be a global, a globally
agreed shared random value. It

00:32:56.917-->00:33:01.250
needs to be, uh, everybody needs
to agree on it but nobody should
be able to predict it, um

00:33:01.250-->00:33:06.833
beforehand. And basically we're
doing that, everyday there's a
new shared random value and the

00:33:06.833-->00:33:12.500
um Tor directory authorities
work that into their consensus
process and - so that's that's a

00:33:12.500-->00:33:18.042
key piece and hopefully we've,
uh, we've finally destroyed the,
um bad people want to run relays

00:33:18.042-->00:33:23.042
in order to attack Tor like this
arms race. Okay, so there's
another problem. Those 6 relays,

00:33:26.125-->00:33:31.000
when I publish my Onion
descriptor to them, they get to
learn my Onion address, so maybe

00:33:31.000-->00:33:36.417
I didn't, I didn't put it on,
you know, uh, an index site, I
didn't publish it, I didn't send

00:33:36.417-->00:33:41.250
it to all my friends, I didn't
tell anybody except the one
person I wanted to know my Onion

00:33:41.250-->00:33:46.750
address. But if you run a bunch
of relays, and you're one of
those 6 and I publish to you,

00:33:46.750-->00:33:51.417
you get to see the Onion
descriptor and you get to learn
my address. So, in fact there

00:33:51.417-->00:33:55.042
are threat intelligence, I have
to wave my hands when I say that
phrase too, there are threat

00:33:55.042-->00:33:59.833
intelligence companies that have
been running relays in the Tor
network with the goal of

00:33:59.833-->00:34:04.375
discovering Onion addresses that
aren't published any other way.
And then they go to like Fortune

00:34:04.375-->00:34:08.458
500 companies and blackmail them
and scare them with phrases like
'dark web' and pictures of

00:34:08.458-->00:34:12.250
icebergs and so on. And
apparently, that's an actual
business - where you scare

00:34:12.250-->00:34:16.792
people with bullsh percent$
internet stuff. Um , so
[audience reacts] we'd like to

00:34:16.792-->00:34:22.542
stop that particular arms race
also, um and the way to do that
is because of the new crypto

00:34:22.542-->00:34:27.542
system that we're using, um, the
new keys allow us to create
subkeys and you can sign the

00:34:29.625-->00:34:33.958
descriptor with the subkey that
way everybody can check the
signature without anybody being

00:34:33.958-->00:34:38.958
able, being able learn the
primary key, the main key from
that. So, it's cool crypto magic

00:34:38.958-->00:34:44.042
that we get from the the
particular crypto system that we
picked for the new keys. Er, so

00:34:44.042-->00:34:49.167
hopefully that will destroy the
arms race with those f**ked up
threat intelligence companies

00:34:49.167-->00:34:52.958
who are trying to [audience
laughs] to, because the the
problem is I don't want people

00:34:52.958-->00:34:58.000
running relays who aren't trying
to protect everybody. If you
wanna run relay because, uh,

00:34:58.000-->00:35:02.625
someone in america might be
unsafe, or somebody in Egypt
might be unsafe that's awesome -

00:35:02.625-->00:35:07.375
please do. If you wanna relay
because you're trying to make
money off something unrelated,

00:35:07.375-->00:35:11.708
you're not helping Tor, so I
wanna make it, I wanna make it
so the Tor network is made more

00:35:11.708-->00:35:17.375
of safe relays. Okay, so
something else that, um that is
exciting that's going on, uh,

00:35:17.375-->00:35:22.958
are called rendezvous single
Onion services. So, in the old
design Alice makes 3 hops into

00:35:22.958-->00:35:27.583
the Tor network, Bob makes 3
hops into the Tor network and
then you got a 6 hop circuit

00:35:27.583-->00:35:33.583
they go over. In the new design,
if you want, you the Onion
service can just make a one hop

00:35:33.583-->00:35:38.250
circuit into the Tor network. So
now it's a 4 hop circuit and you
get the end to end encryption

00:35:38.250-->00:35:43.708
and auth-authentication and so
on, bit you got a lot better
performance. So Facebook did

00:35:43.708-->00:35:50.333
this, uh, debian's mens page did
this so if you're not, if you're
not trying to hide the location

00:35:50.333-->00:35:54.875
of your Onion service, but you
want all the other security
properties for your users, then

00:35:54.875-->00:35:58.750
it makes a lot of sense to do
this. And there's even a cooler
step for that, there's a guy in

00:35:58.750-->00:36:03.792
Europe called Danika who has a
tool called Onion balance and
this allows you to run a bunch

00:36:03.792-->00:36:09.542
of different versions of your
Onion service and it aggregates
them all into one place, so for

00:36:09.542-->00:36:14.792
example, debian does this,
they've got like 6 backup Onion
services for their package

00:36:14.792-->00:36:19.458
service and they they can
restart any of them whenever
they want to, they can take them

00:36:19.458-->00:36:24.208
down for a while because there's
this meta service that
aggregates all the introduction

00:36:24.208-->00:36:28.750
points they have, uh, so it
makes things scale better, it
makes performance better, it

00:36:28.750-->00:36:35.167
makes it easier to manage. Okay,
so there's another challenge.
Um, so, how many people here

00:36:35.167-->00:36:41.667
know the phrase 'entry guard' or
um 'guard relay' or Okay, not
very many - awesome. So, there

00:36:41.667-->00:36:46.667
are a bunch of attacks I don't
have time to get into, but the
fix for many of them is you pick

00:36:46.667-->00:36:52.292
one relay and your first hop and
you stick with that for weeks or
months. And the fact that you

00:36:52.292-->00:36:57.042
don't change it means that you
don't have as much surface area
against bad guys who are trying

00:36:57.042-->00:37:01.792
to run a bunch of relays and
hope to be that first hop. So,
this is great except there are

00:37:01.792-->00:37:06.958
still a bunch of attacks to
discover what your first hop is,
what your guard relay is and

00:37:06.958-->00:37:12.042
these guard discovery attacks
are, are pretty easy and then
once you do them it's pretty bad

00:37:12.042-->00:37:18.458
because, uh, you know the guard
relay and you've got a while to
break in, you got some weeks and

00:37:18.458-->00:37:23.250
maybe it's in Malaysia and
you'll never be able to break
in, but maybe it's in Ohio, when

00:37:23.250-->00:37:28.750
you just call up the cops in
Ohio and there you are. Um, so,
there are a bunch of different

00:37:28.750-->00:37:33.292
fixes we are looking at, it's
still an open research area, but
one of the key things is we need

00:37:33.292-->00:37:39.000
more layers of guards that don't
change as often some of them
change more often um I'd be

00:37:39.000-->00:37:43.917
happy to chat about that one
afterwards, so, um you can learn
more about the vanguard design

00:37:43.917-->00:37:48.917
in Tor proposal 2 71. Okay. So
the hidden service side of the
new, uh, next generation Onion

00:37:51.000-->00:37:56.625
service stuff is in, the relay
side is in, the client side and
the service side, are not in get

00:37:56.625-->00:38:03.250
master right now but if get -
clone that branch you can build
it, it works, just used it this

00:38:03.250-->00:38:09.208
morning, so I'm running an Onion
service, here's a screenshot of
my new style Onion service and

00:38:09.208-->00:38:14.125
you can grab that address and go
to it, you can set up your own.
Over the next couple of weeks,

00:38:14.125-->00:38:18.500
we're going to clean it up more
and merge it into master, do an
actual release that includes it,

00:38:18.500-->00:38:24.625
but you can use it right now,
uh, if you want to. Okay. uh, so
a couple of other things to keep

00:38:24.625-->00:38:30.750
in mind before we finish up. Er
one of the important things: Tor
is not perfect. There are very

00:38:30.750-->00:38:35.417
few, there's no such thing as um
as the perfect privacy tool out
there, especially in the face of

00:38:35.417-->00:38:41.125
billion dollar adversaries. So,
one of the big things we hear
about over and over is - 'oops I

00:38:41.125-->00:38:46.125
wrote my name on my blog post, i
was using Tor but S**t', um and
it's really hard to be perfect

00:38:48.625-->00:38:53.833
in the OpSec world. But that's
a, that's a thing that um if
you're trying to remain safe is

00:38:53.833-->00:38:59.375
something to to really pay
attention to. Er, another piece,
is the browser metadata side. We

00:38:59.375-->00:39:04.625
just started a bug bounty
programme for Tor browser and
some nice person gave us a proxy

00:39:04.625-->00:39:09.292
bypass bug yesterday and we put
out a new version of Tor browser
yesterday that patches it. So,

00:39:09.292-->00:39:15.917
yay for bug bounties, um but
there's I mean - browsers are
terrible things. So somehow we

00:39:15.917-->00:39:21.708
need to find a way to have a
secure um Tor browser and um
maybe that involves more

00:39:21.708-->00:39:27.750
sandboxing, maybe it involves,
uh, trying to find all the other
problems we can patch. Um,

00:39:27.750-->00:39:32.083
Chrome is especially bad news
here because it basically has
some built in proxy bypasses

00:39:32.083-->00:39:37.333
that are part of the designs, so
it's really hard to to turn it
into a Tor browser. Um, and then

00:39:37.333-->00:39:43.208
another piece - browser
exploits. Um, I mean, Java is
bad news and Flash is finally

00:39:43.208-->00:39:49.458
dying, but JavaScript is not so
great, um image handling is not
so great, there are all sorts of

00:39:49.458-->00:39:54.500
pieces of browsers and every so
often we hear about some
government that bought another

00:39:54.500-->00:39:58.792
FireFox Zero Day and used it
against some people in the
world. So that's a, currently a

00:39:58.792-->00:40:03.042
thing we need to keep working
at. And then there's traffic
analysis - imagine you're a

00:40:03.042-->00:40:08.042
large intelligence agency and
you want to, um be able to
monitor as much of the internet

00:40:08.042-->00:40:13.167
as you can in order to be able
to seal a lot of the Tor relays
in order to be able to to match

00:40:13.167-->00:40:18.625
up this user is going to that
place Okay, so how can you help?
There a bunch of different

00:40:18.625-->00:40:23.833
answers there. Um, how many
people here run relays or
bridges or something like that?

00:40:23.833-->00:40:29.667
I see a very tiny number of
hands - more than before -
please run relays. Make the Tor

00:40:29.667-->00:40:34.583
network stronger and safer. Each
relay has an exit policy that
let's you decide whether you

00:40:34.583-->00:40:37.875
want to be the third hop in the
circuit, whether you want to be
the person who goes to the

00:40:37.875-->00:40:43.333
website.So running non exit
relays is also really useful.
You can set them up at your

00:40:43.333-->00:40:48.042
university or your work or
whatever - you're not gonna be
that last hop in the circuit so

00:40:48.042-->00:40:52.708
it will be reasonably safe,
nobody's probably ever gonna
care except for the bandwidth

00:40:52.708-->00:40:58.125
you use so please help us make
the Tor network stronger and
safer. Another piece of that is

00:40:58.125-->00:41:02.333
- teach your friends about
privacy. Teach your friends
about Tor. there are a lot of, I

00:41:02.333-->00:41:07.792
mean, everytime I turn around,
some fed, somewhere is lying to
us about how the internet works.

00:41:07.792-->00:41:13.750
And we need to try to help the
world understand how security
works, why privacy is important

00:41:13.750-->00:41:17.750
and we, this community, are the
ones who are going to do that,
because who else is going to do

00:41:17.750-->00:41:23.542
that. Um, help, help find and
fix bugs, i just, I talked about
the bug bounty thing, um I was

00:41:23.542-->00:41:27.333
talking to Tom earlier who
wanted me to remind everybody -
we especially need Windows

00:41:27.333-->00:41:32.750
developers, most of our users
are on Windows, most of the Tor
developers are on Linux or BSD

00:41:32.750-->00:41:36.708
or MAC or something. So, if
you're a windows developer, we'd
especially love to hear from you

00:41:36.708-->00:41:42.542
um and and we need a lot of help
there. And so pet symposium dot
org is a conference that happens

00:41:42.542-->00:41:48.167
every year, the next one's in
Spain, the last one was in
Minnesota a couple of weeks ago,

00:41:48.167-->00:41:52.542
um and that's basically where
the academics and researchers
all get together to think about

00:41:52.542-->00:41:58.667
um new attacks and new defences
and new designs on being able to
keep people safe. And of course

00:41:58.667-->00:42:03.750
there's donate dot tor project
dot org, we're a nonprofit
that's relatively small compared

00:42:03.750-->00:42:08.500
to the size of the um billion
dollar intelligence agencies out
there so we'd love to have your

00:42:08.500-->00:42:14.292
help there as well - and I will
end with um um an amazing
endorsement from, I'm not sure

00:42:14.292-->00:42:19.792
if it's NSA or GCHQ because they
didn't actually sign the slides
that Ed Snowden walked out with,

00:42:19.792-->00:42:26.250
but it's uh, we're still the
king of high secure low latency
internet anonymity um so says

00:42:26.250-->00:42:31.250
NSA or GCHQ - and with that
[audience applause] so rather
than trying to do the Q and A

00:42:43.458-->00:42:47.542
thing in here because I've got
like 60 seconds left or
something, I'm going to go

00:42:47.542-->00:42:52.500
outside of that waiting area and
I'm going to be, and I'm going
to be the guy in the bright

00:42:52.500-->00:42:56.625
green shirt, I'm happy to chat
with you and answer your
questions and um give you um a

00:42:56.625-->00:43:01.667
card with the Tor PGP key on it
or a sticker or stuff like that
and I'm also going to be around

00:43:01.667-->00:43:06.458
for the rest of the weekend so,
love to talk to yo. Thank you.
[applause]
