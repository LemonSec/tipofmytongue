00:00:00.567-->00:00:05.873
>>Um, so yeah I'm going to talk
about psychographic targeting in
politic- political campaigns.

00:00:05.873-->00:00:10.878
Um, psychographic meaning using
personality and behavior, uh to
target uh ad specific groups of

00:00:13.013-->00:00:17.351
people. Uh, I'm going to speak a
little bit more about the title
of the talk in a couple of

00:00:17.351-->00:00:22.356
slides. Um, but let me explain
how we got into this uh research
and this particular talk. So, in

00:00:25.926-->00:00:30.931
2016 we did some research into
the EU Referendum, some of you
might know as Brexit. Uh, we did

00:00:33.066-->00:00:37.704
six studies consisting of about
eleven thousand participants and
we looked at personality

00:00:37.704-->00:00:44.544
differences. Differences in
numerous skills uh, thinking
styles and cognitive biases. And

00:00:44.544-->00:00:49.549
in three of those studies we
added a question around if, can,
can you all hear me? I guess.

00:00:54.221-->00:00:57.190
[off-mice audience comments]
Closer? Wow. I'll probably be
eating it but, uh ok. So, in,

00:00:57.190-->00:01:03.730
um, in three of those studies
with about five thousand people
we added an additional question

00:01:03.730-->00:01:09.169
that's, uh, asked people's
opinions to how much they agreed
on the nothing uh, nothing to

00:01:09.169-->00:01:13.740
hide nothing to fear argument.
So, if you've got nothing to
hide you've got nothing to fear.

00:01:13.740-->00:01:20.580
What we saw in that research was
that people who voted to leave
the European Union were much

00:01:20.580-->00:01:24.551
more likely to support the
nothing to hide nothing to fear
argument than those that voted

00:01:24.551-->00:01:28.755
to remain. So, we wanted to
study that in greater depth to
understand kind of what, what

00:01:28.755-->00:01:34.261
was going on there. Uh and
understand a little bit more
about the drivers. Then in

00:01:34.261-->00:01:40.500
around January of uh this year,
some of my friends started
pointing out articles like this

00:01:40.500-->00:01:45.739
which appeared in Scout AI and
this is where we got the title
of the talk from really. They

00:01:45.739-->00:01:51.144
introduced it as the rise of the
weaponized AI propaganda
machine. So, using psychographic

00:01:51.144-->00:01:56.116
information in our political
campaigns. So, my friends
weren't the only people that

00:01:56.116-->00:02:00.320
were beginning to sort of
question the efficacy of ya
know, how well does this work

00:02:00.320-->00:02:04.891
essentially. Uh, other
journalists started looking, ya
know looking at that and saying

00:02:04.891-->00:02:10.130
well does this really hold water
or, or not? So, we've got a
little bit of background here in

00:02:10.130-->00:02:17.070
this topic. In 2013 we presented
at Def Con on predicting the
susceptibility to social bots on

00:02:17.070-->00:02:22.409
Twitter. So, seeing which users
would interact with a social bot
based on their Twitter activity.

00:02:22.409-->00:02:28.815
Uh and we also looked at
personality in, in that. In 2011
and 2012 we looked at

00:02:28.815-->00:02:34.688
determining personality through
Facebook activity, uh and
through Twitter. Both of those

00:02:34.688-->00:02:39.693
were pretend at Def Con also.
So, what we decided to do was
use the, uh, using Attitudes

00:02:42.162-->00:02:47.434
Online Surveillance with digital
rights. Use that as like the
central thesis for exploring the

00:02:47.434-->00:02:52.572
efficacy of psychographic
marketing in political
campaigns. So, the rest of the

00:02:52.572-->00:02:59.046
talk is structured into five
main sections. First of all, we
look at why people are divided.

00:02:59.046-->00:03:04.818
Then we move onto what
influences their views and
nudges them one way or another.

00:03:04.818-->00:03:08.588
Then we look at, once we, once
we understand how people are
divided, assuming they are,

00:03:08.588-->00:03:13.894
which spoiler alert, they are,
how can you effectively target
groups with different attitudes

00:03:13.894-->00:03:20.300
in relation to online
communication surveillance? Uh,
once we know how we can target

00:03:20.300-->00:03:26.273
different users, or different
people essentially, we look at
um, how persuasive are targeted

00:03:26.273-->00:03:31.278
ads. And finally, we wrap up
with looking at, okay once the
message is out there, how

00:03:33.313-->00:03:39.086
effective it, how, how able are
you to sort of debunk misleading
information or misinterpreted

00:03:39.086-->00:03:45.125
information once it gets out of
the gate? So, onto the first
question. Looking at why people

00:03:45.125-->00:03:49.629
are divided. Well we chose the
nothing to fear, nothing to hide
argument. But we could have

00:03:49.629-->00:03:55.268
chosen the, the death penalty.
We could have chose the topic of
same sex marriage and we could

00:03:55.268-->00:04:00.207
have chosen the topic of
immigration. So, what, what
seems to be at the center or at

00:04:04.444-->00:04:09.449
least a major factor in all of
these differing world views is
uh, something called

00:04:11.718-->00:04:17.524
Authoritarianism. Which, uh
began as a study in the, I guess
following the second world war

00:04:17.524-->00:04:22.729
but lost some favor, some
credibility in those early years
and has regained credibility in

00:04:22.729-->00:04:27.734
more recent years, in the last
few decades essentially. Um, so
Authoritarianism, as you look at

00:04:29.836-->00:04:35.642
it you might be forgiven for
thinking it's a bimodal
distribution with people either

00:04:35.642-->00:04:39.980
low or high and not a great deal
in the middle. But what we've
actually, ya know what we

00:04:39.980-->00:04:45.819
actually find is that it, it's a
much more skewed distribution
than that. At least in uh the

00:04:45.819-->00:04:50.824
Facebook samples that we see.
So, what, what characterizes
Authoritarianism is that people

00:04:53.627-->00:04:59.499
high in Authoritarianism tend to
see the world in, uh in so,
black and white. Whereas people

00:04:59.499-->00:05:04.604
lower in Authoritarianism see it
tend to see in sort of shades,
shades of grey really and it's a

00:05:04.604-->00:05:09.776
sliding scale. Ya know, so
people are, it, it's very rare
to have people at the certain

00:05:09.776-->00:05:14.781
extremes essentially. People who
are higher in Authoritari-,
Authoritarianism um, have, are

00:05:18.552-->00:05:24.191
more concerned about the upkeep
of societal norms and traditions
whereas people lower in

00:05:24.191-->00:05:29.196
Authoritarianism, uh are more
embracing of new cultures. Um,
new ideas. So, uh, the, the

00:05:32.899-->00:05:38.738
footloose image there. Uh,
additionally what we see is that
those that are higher in

00:05:38.738-->00:05:43.743
Authoritarianism have lower
tolerance for out-groups. Uh,
whereas people who are lower in

00:05:45.912-->00:05:50.417
Authoritarianism uh are much
more embracing of uh different
cultures or ya know difference

00:05:50.417-->00:05:55.422
races and what have you. So, the
scales that we use throughout,
our studies stem from some work

00:05:59.960-->00:06:05.365
by uh, researchers called
Feldman and Stenner in 1997
where they developed uh a very

00:06:05.365-->00:06:10.370
simple way of looking at
Authoritarianism. They developed
a, a four question, uh if you

00:06:12.872-->00:06:17.877
like child rearing
questionnaire. So, if you're um,
if you select answers to these

00:06:21.047-->00:06:25.685
questions which, ya know you
have to select one of the other
for each of the line items. If

00:06:25.685-->00:06:30.724
you're predominately choosing
answers on the right-hand side
than you're more, you're higher

00:06:30.724-->00:06:36.496
in Authoritarianism than people
um choosing answers on the
left-hand side. Ya know

00:06:36.496-->00:06:41.868
generally, there's some
exceptions to that. So, moving
onto our study. Uh and our

00:06:41.868-->00:06:47.140
results for the first thing and
looking at why people, uh why
people differ. Ya know we chose

00:06:47.140-->00:06:53.947
Authoritarianism to uh, to, to,
to look at in greater depth. We
conducted uh four different

00:06:53.947-->00:06:59.953
studies, uh over, well from
February to, uh to May with
differing sample sizes. You'll

00:06:59.953-->00:07:02.656
note that there's studies uh, A
and studies B there's a slight
difference in, in, in the uh

00:07:02.656-->00:07:05.625
studies. All of the questions,
all of the studies uh took um,
basic demographic information,

00:07:05.625-->00:07:10.630
age and sex and they asked, uh a
number of questions about
people's attitudes to online

00:07:17.437-->00:07:22.442
surveillance. Which we
essentially replicated form
prior studies or prior surveys,

00:07:26.579-->00:07:29.683
so that we could actually go
back and reference and see if
our numbers were sort of

00:07:29.683-->00:07:35.388
consistent. The difference
between studies B and A was uh,
uh the, the B studies also

00:07:35.388-->00:07:38.792
contained a numerical question
which we'll get to a little bit
later in the, in the

00:07:38.792-->00:07:43.897
presentation. Because the
studies differed we treat them
kind of individually as well. We

00:07:43.897-->00:07:49.736
don't group them, uh with, uh,
with one exception. So, we had
about two thousand four hundred

00:07:49.736-->00:07:54.908
people took part in those, those
surveys. Which we ran through
Facebook. So, the questions we

00:07:54.908-->00:08:01.748
asked, were uh, your, how much
do, ya know do you agree? And it
was a binary choice, the binary

00:08:01.748-->00:08:06.853
choice in the uh, question
stemmed from work from Professor
Hetherington and Elizabeth Suhay

00:08:06.853-->00:08:13.193
who had looked at uh, previously
looked at uh, Authoritarianism
in American politics in 2011.

00:08:13.193-->00:08:17.063
So, we wanted to try and
replicate some of their work,
so. Do you have nothing to fear?

00:08:17.063-->00:08:21.034
Do you agree or disagree with
you have nothing to fear if you
have nothing, you have nothing

00:08:21.034-->00:08:26.039
to fear if you have nothing to
hide? So, it was, the questions
replicate our EU referendum

00:08:28.808-->00:08:34.781
work. Then the next question
was, uh it is acceptable that
law enforcement agencies have

00:08:34.781-->00:08:40.253
the right to access the content
of citizen's online
communication without a warrant

00:08:40.253-->00:08:44.958
in order to investigate
terrorism. That question was
from the, the Hetherington

00:08:44.958-->00:08:51.131
study. Then the next question we
ask is, it is acceptable that
immigrants and visitors from

00:08:51.131-->00:08:55.935
potentially dangerous countries
should have to reveal their
social media account passwords

00:08:55.935-->00:09:00.874
to border agents. So, we, we
used the UK samples, but you can
do this on a US sample set, too.

00:09:04.978-->00:09:10.950
The next question, which came
from a survey on attitudes to
privacy in 2016, were simply the

00:09:10.950-->00:09:15.955
darknet should be shut down. Now
quite sure how you do that, but
um, but it comes from a survey.

00:09:19.059-->00:09:24.464
So, we wanted to, you know it
gave me a chuckle so we added
that in. And the final question

00:09:24.464-->00:09:29.135
we asked was companies should
not be allowed to develop
technologies that prevent law

00:09:29.135-->00:09:34.274
enforcement from accessing your
online conversations. And that
came from that same uh, privacy

00:09:34.274-->00:09:40.980
survey. So, going back to our
surveys I mentioned we treat
them differently because, uh

00:09:40.980-->00:09:47.487
there were different um, B,
studies B and A have, were, were
slightly different so we treated

00:09:47.487-->00:09:53.426
them different statistically. Uh
the other thing that happened
was that in March uh, late March

00:09:53.426-->00:09:59.866
there was a terrorist attack in
London. Um, so what we wanted to
do was, well see what the effect

00:09:59.866-->00:10:05.171
was of the terrorist attack
attitudes to online
surveillance. And there's been

00:10:05.171-->00:10:10.777
previous work in that space, uh
researchers have looked at the
differing attitudes before and

00:10:10.777-->00:10:16.749
after the Charlie Hebdo attacks
in, in Paris. So, what we see
from the results of uh surveys

00:10:16.749-->00:10:22.755
A1 and A2, the ones without the
numeric question is that uh, for
most of the questions you get

00:10:22.755-->00:10:28.328
around a sort of a thirty, thir-
ya know, thirty percentage agree
with the statement. Uh only one

00:10:28.328-->00:10:33.333
of those was statistically um,
different before and after the
attacks. And that was the

00:10:36.002-->00:10:40.773
banning the anti-surveillance
technology question. Uh the rest
while it looks like there is a

00:10:40.773-->00:10:45.078
visual difference, well there is
a visual difference, um we
didn't see a statistically

00:10:45.078-->00:10:50.884
significant different between
opinions. Um the thing that
interested me or fascinated me

00:10:50.884-->00:10:55.688
the most about the results is
that there was uh ya know more
support for shutting down the

00:10:55.688-->00:11:00.627
dark net, people just want to
shut that circuit down
essentially. Um, so looking at

00:11:02.896-->00:11:09.702
studies B1 and B2, uh which we
can, the, the B2 study was
conducted forty-one days after

00:11:09.702-->00:11:15.542
the, uh, a- attacks. We see that
there's almost no difference in
opinions uh from before and

00:11:15.542-->00:11:20.280
after. So, the opinion sort of
drop off after the, uh, after
the terrorist attacks in those

00:11:20.280-->00:11:25.285
surveys. So, we see broadly the,
the level of support there is
hovers, hovers around th- thirty

00:11:27.987-->00:11:32.425
percent and we'll get a little,
we'll get to that a little more
in the presentation. So, looking

00:11:32.425-->00:11:38.498
at the role of Authoritarianism
in, uh, in these attitudes when
we look at the nothing to hide,

00:11:38.498-->00:11:44.037
nothing to fear question, uh in
particular. We see, um you know
somewhere between a one and a

00:11:44.037-->00:11:48.808
half to a two and a half uh,
times inc- increase between
those who agree with the

00:11:48.808-->00:11:55.515
statement being more
Authoritarian uh versus those
who disagree with the statement.

00:11:55.515-->00:12:01.387
Uh, we also performed like, um,
uh, uh the logistic regression
essentially to look at plotting

00:12:01.387-->00:12:05.959
the odds and some other
statistical methods and we find
the same difference. You know,

00:12:05.959-->00:12:10.697
broadly through all of them. In
terms of, the, the other
questions we see sort of broadly

00:12:10.697-->00:12:14.567
similar results as well around
wiretapping, shutting down the
dark net, banning

00:12:14.567-->00:12:19.105
anti-surveillance technology,
and extreme vetting. So, we see
consistently, not just across

00:12:19.105-->00:12:24.110
the questions but also between
all of the different age groups
and sexes uh that the, these

00:12:26.412-->00:12:29.682
opinions tend to, tend to be
fairly consistent. So, assuming
that Authoritarianism is more a,

00:12:29.682-->00:12:31.684
a constant, what is it that can
influence people's uh, differing
views? So, it's said, uh by a

00:12:31.684-->00:12:33.686
gentleman called Bob, uh,
Altemeyer who developed the uh,
what was called the Right Wing

00:12:33.686-->00:12:38.691
Authoritarian Scale in 1996 that
uh Authoritarians are
characterized as being like ten

00:12:43.997-->00:12:49.002
steps closer to the panic
button. So, we saw a plot there
on, on this graph and show the

00:13:02.882-->00:13:09.656
blue line is essentially the,
the baseline of support for, uh
for surveillance. Then there

00:13:09.656-->00:13:14.661
are, uh two streams of research
that have looked at this
previously. The first stream of

00:13:17.330-->00:13:22.335
research uh, by Feldman and
Stenner, had uh, it essentially
argued that a threat inc-, the,

00:13:24.737-->00:13:28.808
the perception of threat
increases the support among
those who are higher in

00:13:28.808-->00:13:35.615
Authoritarianism. So, uh the,
the folks at the higher end of
the scale are going to support

00:13:35.615-->00:13:40.953
it more if they are more
concerned about the threats of
terrorism. Another stream of

00:13:40.953-->00:13:46.893
research by Hetherington and
Suhay in two thousand and- 2011,
found that the threat increased

00:13:46.893-->00:13:53.132
su-, support among those lower
in uh, Authoritarianism so um,
people at the higher end didn't

00:13:53.132-->00:13:58.337
really change their opinion if
something, um ya know if they
perceived a threat to be high

00:13:58.337-->00:14:03.810
but those much lower more likely
to adopt an Authoritarianism
position, uh, if they perceived

00:14:03.810-->00:14:10.616
the threat to be high. Uh, the
researchers that looked at the
difference in uh, before and

00:14:10.616-->00:14:15.488
after the Charlie Hebdo attack
which are mentioned a little bit
early looked at this and suggest

00:14:15.488-->00:14:21.561
that both are partly right. And
that it's anxiety that, um is
responsible for causing the

00:14:21.561-->00:14:25.865
uplift in those that are lower
in Authoritarianism if they are
concerned about the threat of

00:14:25.865-->00:14:31.871
terror versus uh, anger in uh,
people higher in
Authoritarianism, if they

00:14:31.871-->00:14:36.876
perceived the threat of terror
to be high. So, in the study
that we conducted uh what we've

00:14:38.878-->00:14:45.184
done in all the studies we had
uh, uh a question simply asked,
uh, how worried are you that you

00:14:45.184-->00:14:50.156
might personally become a victim
uh, of a terrorist attack? And
that was coded. People could

00:14:50.156-->00:14:55.428
answer in like four ways from
like I'm not worried at all to,
yea I'm very concerned. And that

00:14:55.428-->00:15:01.234
replicates the work from
Hetherington and Suhay. So, what
we did, is we used a logistic

00:15:01.234-->00:15:06.773
regression. Essentially uh,
replicating Hetherington's work.
Um plotting the probability for

00:15:06.773-->00:15:11.043
support for each of those
questions against
Authoritarianism and then

00:15:11.043-->00:15:17.784
looking at the effect of
people's perceptions on, uh, on
threats. So, Hetherington and

00:15:17.784-->00:15:23.523
Suhay's work, I figured out that
I- I- I am just so sorry about
the, the bad quality photo from

00:15:23.523-->00:15:27.093
uh, from Hetherington's book.
But here you can see is the
effect that he was talking

00:15:27.093-->00:15:32.999
about. Essentially people lower
in Authoritarianism, you see
that the support, uh really

00:15:32.999-->00:15:38.905
increases from about twenty-five
percent of support on their
wiretapping question to about uh

00:15:38.905-->00:15:43.609
seventy-five, eighty percent
probability of support. And
you'll see at the higher end of

00:15:43.609-->00:15:50.316
Authoritarianism there's really
not a great deal of difference.
So, in uh, our study, in terms

00:15:50.316-->00:15:56.722
of the, uh nothing to hide
nothing to fear question, we see
essentially a similar sort of

00:15:56.722-->00:16:01.861
effect happening to what
Hetherington and Suhay found.
Um, so going from about an

00:16:01.861-->00:16:07.133
eighteen percent probability of
support for those who are not
concerned um and are lower in

00:16:07.133-->00:16:12.972
Authoritarianism. That jumped to
about a sixty percent um level
of support. But there's not many

00:16:12.972-->00:16:18.644
in that category. Uh and at the
higher end there's almost no
difference. Looking at all of

00:16:18.644-->00:16:23.516
the other questions uh, at least
for wiretapping and banning
anti-surveillance tech we see a

00:16:23.516-->00:16:28.421
similar sort of trend going on.
Um, I'll talk about extreme
vetting and shutting down the

00:16:28.421-->00:16:34.627
dark net shortly. So, extreme
vetting is uh, is, is an anomaly
but Hetherington had seen in uh,

00:16:34.627-->00:16:40.099
or, had seen a similar sort of
uh interaction in one of his
other questions. So, that needs

00:16:40.099-->00:16:45.304
more, more analysis. But I
didn't want to shirk away from
calling that one out. Uh the

00:16:45.304-->00:16:51.611
other thing, which interested me
was that you, here you see
reflected the high level of

00:16:51.611-->00:16:56.816
support for shutting down the
dark net and you see how that
jumps up even from like a medium

00:16:56.816-->00:17:01.254
high, very high level. You see
the interactions so that if
people are concerned of the

00:17:01.254-->00:17:06.259
threat of terror, you know,
there's broad support for uh,
tackling the, the dark net. So,

00:17:08.461-->00:17:15.434
okay, now we've looked at how
people differ around the, the uh
disposition of Authoritarianism.

00:17:15.434-->00:17:22.375
Uh we can see the role, uh
perception of threat has uh on
people's attitudes. Now we look

00:17:22.375-->00:17:28.114
at, okay how can we target those
different groups of people? How
can we target people who are low

00:17:28.114-->00:17:33.119
in Authoritarianism versus
people who are high in
Authoritarianism? So essentially

00:17:35.187-->00:17:40.559
a lot of research is looked at,
um the relationship between age,
sex, geography, Facebook

00:17:40.559-->00:17:46.432
interest, Facebook activity and
such like and personality. What
we want to be able to do here is

00:17:46.432-->00:17:50.836
almost get uh, personality, in
our case we use
Authoritarianism, put it through

00:17:50.836-->00:17:56.409
a function and get the age, sex,
geography and Facebook interests
that are going to be most

00:17:56.409-->00:18:01.314
closely associated with people
that are either low or high in
Authoritarianism. So, if you

00:18:01.314-->00:18:07.720
like, we create two book-it, one
book-it for low Authoritarian
and one book-it for uh, high

00:18:07.720-->00:18:12.725
Authoritarian. So, onto the
study on our, our findings. Uh
first of all, tackling age and

00:18:15.728-->00:18:20.733
sex. What we saw in the EU
Referendum studies was that the
difference between female voters

00:18:24.337-->00:18:29.342
who voted to leave or remain in
the EU had much closer level of
Authoritarianism. There wasn't a

00:18:32.078-->00:18:36.415
great deal to separate them and
indeed looking at the results
there are very low percentages

00:18:36.415-->00:18:41.420
of females in eighteen to
thirty-five age group who wanted
to uh leave, the, the EU. We

00:18:43.789-->00:18:48.794
also saw that reflected in uh
the studies that we, we'd look
at there. It, with regards to

00:18:50.997-->00:18:55.901
uh, the, um the nothing to fear
nothing to hide argument, online
um, communication and

00:18:55.901-->00:19:01.107
surveillance. You'll see that as
females get older the difference
extends so there is a starker

00:19:01.107-->00:19:06.912
difference. And that gets like
more consistent with males. Of
males, there was, uh there was

00:19:06.912-->00:19:12.985
differences at every age. So, in
terms of the book-its we created
and we created these book-its so

00:19:12.985-->00:19:18.491
we could add them into the
Facebook advertising audiences.
Uh, we have the low

00:19:18.491-->00:19:23.896
Authoritarian groups, of males
of any age but females only if
they're under thirty-five and

00:19:23.896-->00:19:28.634
for the high Authoritarian
category we used males of any
age and females who are

00:19:28.634-->00:19:33.639
thirty-five and over. So, that's
a simple uh, like age and sex
classification. And, uh it, it

00:19:36.142-->00:19:42.481
is, you know rather typically
simple but as we see it becomes
quite effective. So, for

00:19:42.481-->00:19:47.486
geography, uh Rentfrow and uh,
and other researchers have
looked at regional differences

00:19:49.688-->00:19:55.261
in personality. These are maps
of the United Kingdom and the
letters at the bottom reflect

00:19:55.261-->00:20:00.132
what's called the Big Five
personalities. So, you've got
openness to experience, uh which

00:20:00.132-->00:20:05.771
is you know strongly correlated
with creativity.
Conscientiousness, which is more

00:20:05.771-->00:20:10.509
concerned about some of the, the
traditions and what have you or
relate, or correlates with that.

00:20:10.509-->00:20:17.016
You've got extroversion,
agreeableness and neuroticism.
So, he's looked at different

00:20:17.016-->00:20:23.923
areas with a, a very large uh
samples that across the UK and
found different regional, uh

00:20:23.923-->00:20:27.927
regional differences. He's also
done that with the United States
as well though if you're

00:20:27.927-->00:20:33.032
interested in those regional
differences you can check that
out. So, he's presented uh, a

00:20:33.032-->00:20:37.870
lot of results and findings for
each of about three hundred
different local area districts

00:20:37.870-->00:20:43.476
in the United Kingdom. So, what
we did is we mapped
Authoritarianism to the big five

00:20:43.476-->00:20:49.782
using uh some matter analysis
from uh researchers Sibley and
Duckett. And in terms of

00:20:49.782-->00:20:55.855
Authoritarianism it's classified
uh or high Authoritarianism is
classified by high degrees of

00:20:55.855-->00:21:01.427
conscientious and lower degrees
of openness mostly. There's a
slight difference in neuroticism

00:21:01.427-->00:21:07.266
but we can you know, pretty
safely ignore that. So, for our
research what we did, we plotted

00:21:07.266-->00:21:13.606
openness on the uh, openness
here, but we reverse it. So, we
get low openness essentially.

00:21:13.606-->00:21:18.611
Um, against conscientiousness.
And then we take the results
from Rentfrow's study of uh over

00:21:21.814-->00:21:26.152
three hundred areas in the UK
and we plot them on a graph
that's a little bit like this.

00:21:26.152-->00:21:30.823
So, you get the high
Authoritarians at the top right
hand corner and you get the low

00:21:30.823-->00:21:37.663
Authoritarians towards the uh
bottom left. And um, since it's
a hacker conference it's quite

00:21:37.663-->00:21:43.469
interesting that the least
Authoritarian place in the
United Kingdom is called Hackney

00:21:43.469-->00:21:48.474
in London. And I didn't make
that up for the, for the talk.
But um, so we chose some towns,

00:21:51.644-->00:21:57.950
um that were most likely to be
in our opinion high
Authoritarian and some towns and

00:21:57.950-->00:22:03.088
cities that were most likely to
be low in Authoritarianism. We
also looked at like how many

00:22:03.088-->00:22:07.693
people were there for reach and
stuff like that. And so, we have
some other characteristics that

00:22:07.693-->00:22:12.231
we, we looked at. The towns that
we chose for low Authoritarian
were towns that most of you have

00:22:12.231-->00:22:19.104
probably heard of, Cambridge,
Liverpool, Edinburgh and now you
have all heard of Hackney. Um,

00:22:19.104-->00:22:23.242
and in the high Authoritarian
town we've got high
Authoritarian districts we've

00:22:23.242-->00:22:27.913
got places like Basildon,
Thurrock and Mansfield. Uh and
Swindon, you might have heard of

00:22:27.913-->00:22:34.086
Swindon if you like the game,
like my son does, The Amazon
Frog and Pungence's YouTube

00:22:34.086-->00:22:38.490
channel. Other than that, I'm
not sure that any of those towns
are that famous outside of the

00:22:38.490-->00:22:44.830
United Kingdom. So now we've got
a book-it for age and sex and
we've got the regions that we're

00:22:44.830-->00:22:50.536
going to use in our Facebook
advertising. And incidentally
the results that we found using

00:22:50.536-->00:22:55.741
just a simple logistic
regression were actually really
good at correctly classifying

00:22:55.741-->00:23:00.813
the EU Referendum vote. And we
did the same thing when we
looked at the uh regional

00:23:00.813-->00:23:06.952
differences in the US, um
predicting the, uh recent
election that you guys had. So,

00:23:06.952-->00:23:10.956
onto Facebook interests. There's
a tool here called the
PreferenceTool, uh that's

00:23:10.956-->00:23:16.262
available to researchers where
you use like slider bars if you
like to put in uh difference

00:23:16.262-->00:23:22.034
effects of personality and that
shows you some of the Facebook
interests that those groups use.

00:23:22.034-->00:23:27.406
Now, we did not use the
preference tool because it's
available only to uh, to

00:23:27.406-->00:23:33.412
researchers. Um, and we did, we
didn't need to do that really
because we looked at some of the

00:23:33.412-->00:23:38.684
Facebooks interests that we
already knew were highly
correlated with Authoritarianism

00:23:38.684-->00:23:44.423
and low Authoritarians. So, the
low Authoritarian category we
chose just simply the interest

00:23:44.423-->00:23:50.896
of liberalism, uh which is a
Facebook interests. And um, the
Guardian newspaper which I guess

00:23:50.896-->00:23:56.168
is like your Washington Post, I
guess. Uh, for the high
Authoritarian category we chose

00:23:56.168-->00:24:01.106
conservatism and, and the Mail
Online. I'm not sure what the
equivalent US newspaper is.

00:24:07.179-->00:24:10.149
[laughter] Somebody shouted
something out but I didn't hear
it. But um, so the, the baseline

00:24:10.149-->00:24:12.151
we've got to, to, to beat if you
like is uh the nothing to hide,
nothing to fear argument we had

00:24:12.151-->00:24:15.988
uh sort of a baseline of
thirty-eight percent support for
that particular argument in the

00:24:15.988-->00:24:21.193
studies that we use in this
sample set. For the targeted
audience just based on uh, age,

00:24:21.193-->00:24:26.198
sex and geography we saw a drop
from thirty-eight percent to
twenty-two, uh thirty-two

00:24:29.935-->00:24:34.940
percent but it wasn't
statistically significant. We
saw an uplift in um, support for

00:24:40.279-->00:24:45.284
the high Authoritarian towns
from thirty-eight to forty-six.
Um when we added the Facebook

00:24:47.820-->00:24:54.626
interests in that we looked at
for the correlation to uh to, to
Authoritarianism we saw that we

00:24:54.626-->00:24:59.098
started to get significant
results although for the first
group it was relatively low.

00:24:59.098-->00:25:03.402
Possibly due to the overall skew
to look towards low
Authoritarianism anyway. So,

00:25:03.402-->00:25:09.441
from thirty-eight agreement with
the argument to twenty-five is
not bad. Uh, for a very simple

00:25:09.441-->00:25:14.780
experiment. And in the high
Authoritarian category adding in
personality we see the jump go

00:25:14.780-->00:25:19.785
from thirty-eight percent to
sixty-one percent, um which was
highly statically significant. A

00:25:22.154-->00:25:28.093
quick note on the significance,
um if, if I'm doing this in the
wild I might not be so

00:25:28.093-->00:25:33.265
interested or worried about P
levels and stuff like that. If I
consistently see the results

00:25:33.265-->00:25:37.936
like that maybe I just take a
gamble on it anyway and it might
give me sort of a higher return

00:25:37.936-->00:25:43.642
on my advertising investment.
So, okay, we've seen the
differences in personality and

00:25:43.642-->00:25:48.647
we've seen how we can target
different groups based on just
some um, simple factors that uh,

00:25:50.849-->00:25:55.854
uh enable us to reach audiences
with uh significantly different
views on online communication

00:25:58.590-->00:26:04.963
surveillance. But, now we want
to turn to, well what about
persuasive ads and uh, targeting

00:26:04.963-->00:26:10.135
of ads? So, this is uh Alexander
Nix from Cambridge Analytica and
he states and this video is, is

00:26:10.135-->00:26:15.941
online, if you knew the
personality of the people you're
targeting you can nuance your

00:26:15.941-->00:26:20.913
messaging to resonate more
effectively with those key
audience groups. So, there's

00:26:20.913-->00:26:26.118
been some research in this
space. The study by Hirsh, Kang
and Bodenhausen. They looked at,

00:26:26.118-->00:26:31.423
they created five separate
telephone uh ads, that would
design to appeal to different

00:26:31.423-->00:26:36.528
levels of the Big Five of
personality. So, this is the app
that they used or at least this

00:26:36.528-->00:26:41.533
is the text that they used and
uh, in uh app that was aimed at
uh, extroversion. The XPhone,

00:26:43.569-->00:26:49.808
with Xphone you'll always be
where the excitement is. And
then for neuroticism, they have

00:26:49.808-->00:26:54.580
Stay safe and secure with the
Xphone. And they always saw
statistically significant

00:26:54.580-->00:27:01.153
differences. Uh, Matz, Popov,
Kosinski and Stillwell did a
similar thing looking at aiming

00:27:01.153-->00:27:06.158
at introverts and extroverts, uh
for a beauty product and they
saw that indeed uh, targeting

00:27:08.727-->00:27:15.133
those ads based on, um, on the
personality had uh, significant
uh effect on their click through

00:27:15.133-->00:27:20.639
rates so their return on their
advertising investment. So,
moving onto our study and

00:27:20.639-->00:27:25.444
results, what we did was we had
ads that were aimed at um,
people in the high Authoritarian

00:27:25.444-->00:27:31.683
book-it and ads that were
targeted at people who were in
the low Authoritarian book-its.

00:27:31.683-->00:27:34.953
And we split that into, uh to
ads that are designed to be
pro-surveillance and ads that

00:27:34.953-->00:27:39.958
are uh, designed to be
anti-surveillance. So, the first
ad for pro was really appealing

00:27:42.828-->00:27:49.401
to uh, to the high Authoritarian
categories. Terrorists, don't
let them hide online. Um, so

00:27:49.401-->00:27:56.108
hopefully invoking some anger
there. For the low Authoritarian
group, we tried to highlight

00:27:56.108-->00:28:01.413
that uh there was more than just
terrorism uh, online. We had the
tagline, Crime doesn't stop

00:28:01.413-->00:28:06.218
where the internet starts. And I
know it's cheesy but um, the,
the thinking was that people

00:28:06.218-->00:28:10.289
would look at uh, uh broader
crimes like human traffic-,
trafficking and child

00:28:10.289-->00:28:15.294
exploitation. So, for the uh low
authoritarian group with the
anti-surveillance message we

00:28:19.464-->00:28:23.302
used the image of uh, Anne Frank
and said you know, do you really
have nothing to fear if you've

00:28:23.302-->00:28:28.307
got nothing to hide? And for the
high Authoritarian group we used
an image of the D-Day landings

00:28:30.943-->00:28:37.416
um appealing to the
Authoritarian characteristics of
um, affiliation with military

00:28:37.416-->00:28:42.521
and respect for elders. So,
those were the ads we
categorized and then in looking

00:28:42.521-->00:28:47.359
at the results of those ads we,
uh references them here and
these are the self-reported

00:28:47.359-->00:28:52.664
levels of Authoritarianism and
people that took part of our
surveys or uh, samples to uh,

00:28:52.664-->00:28:57.302
to, to rate the ads. So, they
were asked a bunch of questions,
like how much do you like that

00:28:57.302-->00:29:04.076
ad? How much does the ad
resonate with my beliefs, uh how
persuasive is the ad, how likely

00:29:04.076-->00:29:08.814
am I to click like, or share on
the app? That, that kind of
thing. And we split that then in

00:29:08.814-->00:29:14.753
people's self-reported um,
self-reported groups. So, this
was, this was actually where

00:29:14.753-->00:29:21.193
the, where the uh persuasive of
the ad is rated. And that is,
that is what people's level of

00:29:21.193-->00:29:27.666
Authoritarianism were classed
as. So, high, medium and low.
Okay, so the performance of the

00:29:27.666-->00:29:32.304
high Authoritarian ad. We see
that people who are high in
Authoritarianism like the ad

00:29:32.304-->00:29:37.743
much more than people who were
like medium and low. When we
moved to the ad for the low

00:29:37.743-->00:29:41.713
Authoritarian group we see
people who were high still like
it. It's kind of bought in

00:29:41.713-->00:29:46.618
because they're, they're,
they're more pre, more pro uh
surveillance anyway. But we see

00:29:46.618-->00:29:52.190
then an uplift in uh, uh well an
expected uplift in the low and
medium. We see an uplift in the

00:29:52.190-->00:29:58.563
low and medium Authoritarian
categories. So, the ad seems to
be having the sort of desired

00:29:58.563-->00:30:04.369
effect if you'd like. For the
low Authoritarian category in
anti-surveillance we see kind of

00:30:04.369-->00:30:09.941
a reversal of the higher auth-,
uh pro add where people who are
low in Authoritarianism like it

00:30:09.941-->00:30:16.748
and people who are high don't
like it so much. Um, when we
target the ad towards or when we

00:30:16.748-->00:30:22.120
created the ads for um, the high
Authoritarian group we see a
similar sort of uplift to the

00:30:22.120-->00:30:27.826
one we've got in the top right
hand corner. Um, and there's a
broad level of uh increase of

00:30:27.826-->00:30:33.799
support from those medium and
high. So, so that's people's
responses to how much they like

00:30:33.799-->00:30:38.837
the ad. Then we took it a step
further and tested it in the
wild with, with um Facebook ads

00:30:38.837-->00:30:43.408
designed or actually, there were
Facebook posts and we used the
boosting in the Facebook

00:30:43.408-->00:30:49.681
advertising, um to appeal to
those different uh, those
different audiences. So, here we

00:30:49.681-->00:30:55.053
see the Facebook target
audiences of high and low
Authoritarian. There's only tow,

00:30:55.053-->00:30:59.991
tow group from our target
audience. And then um, the, the
ads in those, um boxes uh re-

00:31:03.762-->00:31:09.968
relate to the ads we just saw.
So, what we do for this, using
the, the Facebook advertising

00:31:09.968-->00:31:15.173
essentially is then look at the
click through rates or actually,
this is actually the ratios of

00:31:15.173-->00:31:20.545
likes and shares by, by the
level of reach for each ad. Um
so the numbers look pretty low

00:31:20.545-->00:31:26.852
but I actually um you know those
are fairly consistent with click
through rates that you would

00:31:26.852-->00:31:32.924
expect. So, for the ad aimed at
the high auth group we see as
expected people who are in high

00:31:32.924-->00:31:38.230
in Authoritarian like the ad,
people who are low think it
sucks. Uh, in the low

00:31:38.230-->00:31:44.703
Authoritarian ad uh there was a,
a lot less traction altogether
and fakebook gives you

00:31:44.703-->00:31:49.975
forewarning. It basically says
that you know, ads that got a
lot of text uh, do less well.

00:31:49.975-->00:31:55.180
You might want to consider
changing your ad. But what I
draw your attention to, at least

00:31:55.180-->00:32:01.486
is that there was a, an expected
difference in the, the
correlation coefficient if you

00:32:01.486-->00:32:06.491
like. So, the, the gap uh the
gap reduced between the, the low
and high. So, if we move onto

00:32:10.195-->00:32:15.834
the low Authoritarian ads, uh
for anti-surveillance we see the
expected results that low,

00:32:15.834-->00:32:20.839
people in the low Authoritarian
target like the ad or interact
with the ad much more than those

00:32:20.839-->00:32:26.678
in the high Authoritarian or
more than those in the high. But
then what we see for the ad

00:32:26.678-->00:32:33.185
that's targeted at people in the
high Authoritarian, uh, uh,
designed to appeal to people who

00:32:33.185-->00:32:36.888
are high in Authoritarianism and
anti. We still get a lot of
people who are low in

00:32:36.888-->00:32:41.193
Authoritarian doesn't like it.
Because they like the message of
I don't, you know, they don't,

00:32:41.193-->00:32:47.999
um, on, online communication
surveillance or the idea of it.
But people higher end support it

00:32:47.999-->00:32:51.903
a lot more. That was kind of
surprising to us. We, we thought
we'd actually get more of a

00:32:51.903-->00:32:58.143
backlash from those, uh those
groups. Uh rather than, rather
than the, the interaction so

00:32:58.143-->00:33:04.583
again we see the correlation
coefficient reduces as we would
have expected from the ads. But

00:33:04.583-->00:33:07.485
uh, some of you might be
thinking, ok well, that's well
and good, we're seeing how much

00:33:07.485-->00:33:11.389
people are liking click on ads,
but does persuasion actually
work. You haven't actually told

00:33:11.389-->00:33:17.329
us that, fair, fair comment, I
haven't. Uh and there is very
little research in, into that.

00:33:17.329-->00:33:22.400
But this research by, um,
researchers at the University of
Mannheim in, in Germany,

00:33:22.400-->00:33:27.472
Jungherr, Wuttke, and Co. What
they did is say, uh took
people's attitudes to

00:33:27.472-->00:33:32.911
transatlantic trade and the
sample set was a large, it was
about 8-->000 people. Then they

00:33:32.911-->00:33:38.650
sent some of them some ads, um
explaining or some literature
about the benefits of

00:33:38.650-->00:33:44.689
transatlantic trade, uh and they
found that over, the, the
baseline which is the zero line,

00:33:44.689-->00:33:49.361
the, the control of people who
didn't receive the literature,
they found that people became

00:33:49.361-->00:33:55.500
more, much more supportive after
they, of transatlantic trade
after they received the uh, the

00:33:55.500-->00:34:00.772
literature. And they look at um,
the difference in opinions
shortly after receiving the

00:34:00.772-->00:34:05.977
literature and then some time
after and they did not- they did
notice a drop off in uh, the

00:34:05.977-->00:34:11.149
time. But uh you know it
suggests that if you're wanting
to be, get persuasive material

00:34:11.149-->00:34:16.988
out there, the time is of the
essence. So, okay, now we've
seen, you know you can get the

00:34:16.988-->00:34:22.160
message out there but what if
the message is erroneous? SO how
would you go about sort of

00:34:22.160-->00:34:27.332
debunking propaganda. Well to,
to this, well it's not really
how we care about debunking it.

00:34:27.332-->00:34:31.202
TI's what are the challenges of
debunking propaganda. So, for
this we turn to some research

00:34:31.202-->00:34:38.209
from Professor uh, Dan Kahan at
Yale University. He divided
participants in his experiment

00:34:38.209-->00:34:45.216
into 4 categories, A, B, C, and
D. For categories A and B, he
gave them a numerical question

00:34:45.216-->00:34:50.221
about how well uh, skin cream
does at treating a rash. Um, and
he gave them a number grid which

00:34:52.324-->00:34:58.830
like this. So, group A received
this number grid and were asked
to say, okay did skin cream

00:34:58.830-->00:35:04.869
essentially make the rash better
or did it make it worse? And
people had to go figure that

00:35:04.869-->00:35:10.842
out. Whereas group B, the text
was uh, slightly changed. Um but
the numbers remained the same,

00:35:10.842-->00:35:14.446
so the rash gets better or the
rash gets worse. Well they found
that people did roughly the, uh

00:35:14.446-->00:35:19.451
had roughly the same um, ability
to answer the, the, the
question. But when he changed

00:35:22.988-->00:35:29.494
the question to one about uh,
does gun control reduce or
increase crime, he found that

00:35:29.494-->00:35:34.699
people's ideological beliefs
really hampered their ability to
answer the question. And I'll

00:35:34.699-->00:35:39.304
demonstrate that because we
replicated uh Kahan's study in
our EU Referendum work. But we

00:35:39.304-->00:35:43.508
changed the question from one
about gun control to one about
immigration increasing or

00:35:43.508-->00:35:48.513
decreasing crime. So here we see
how um, how people do at the
skin cream ad if you'd like so

00:35:52.217-->00:35:57.222
uh, broadly consistent. Uh just
under 60% getting it right in
the referendum result, leave vs.

00:35:59.724-->00:36:04.663
remain. But when we ask about
does immigration uh, decrease
crime people who voted to, to

00:36:07.365-->00:36:12.370
leave would just not have any of
that or were unable to answer
the question or their

00:36:12.370-->00:36:17.809
performance tanked essentially.
Whereas people who voted to
remain their performance at

00:36:17.809-->00:36:24.015
answering the question actually
increased. Then when we switch
it to immigration increases

00:36:24.015-->00:36:29.621
crime then the leave voters
start doing better again. But
the remain voters performance

00:36:29.621-->00:36:34.626
tanks. Uh, and uh, the, the, the
research that he's conducted is,
is termed 'Ideologically

00:36:36.761-->00:36:42.600
Motivated Reasoning' and it was
dubbed, uh in one article the
most depressing brain finding

00:36:42.600-->00:36:48.206
ever, which I liked. His study
was from a little while ago but
it's pretty exciting. He's got

00:36:48.206-->00:36:53.645
uh, a web page you should go
check out called the cultural
cognition uh project and it's

00:36:53.645-->00:37:00.518
well worth a read. So, in our
study, um we sort of replicated
that research again but used

00:37:00.518-->00:37:06.458
the, the, you know the attitudes
to online surveillance. So in
the skin cream ads we see

00:37:06.458-->00:37:10.962
similar sorts of trends between
those that agree and disagree
with the nothing to fear nothing

00:37:10.962-->00:37:17.068
to hide argument. But then when
we suggest that surveillance
actually increases the threat of

00:37:17.068-->00:37:22.574
a terrorist attack than those
who agree with the statement,
their performance drops quite

00:37:22.574-->00:37:26.678
significantly. Whereas those who
disagree, their performance
drops a bit. Um and I would

00:37:26.678-->00:37:31.249
suggest that the performance
drops a bit because the
numerical question is actually,

00:37:31.249-->00:37:36.187
the, the text in it is actually
harder to read than it was for
the immigration and gun control.

00:37:38.223-->00:37:42.761
When we switched to a
surveillance actually does
decrease the threat then we see

00:37:42.761-->00:37:49.734
the interaction just not as
starkly. Uh however the
interaction does seem to

00:37:49.734-->00:37:54.739
increase as people get older.
Um, so you see a more
significant result as people get

00:38:04.582-->00:38:09.587
over 35 and here we just show 44
and over. So, in terms of uh,
wrapping the, wrapping the talk

00:38:12.757-->00:38:17.762
up. What we've seen is that
Authoritarianism plays a part in
why, why people differ or why

00:38:20.365-->00:38:26.804
their opinions differ. We've
found that the perception of, of
threat plays a part in actually

00:38:26.804-->00:38:33.478
influencing or nudging people
from a baseline position to a
different position. Uh we found

00:38:33.478-->00:38:39.284
that we are able to actually
target people with different
attitudes to online uh,

00:38:39.284-->00:38:45.757
surveillance. Uh just by using
uh some simple knowledge about
the, the psychological traits

00:38:45.757-->00:38:50.828
associated with
Authoritarianism. Uh we find
that the persuasiveness of, of

00:38:50.828-->00:38:55.767
ads does indeed um seem to work
and that challenging or tackling
misleading information is going

00:38:55.767-->00:39:00.238
to be a, a very challenging
problem because people's ability
to, to uh interpret uh evidence

00:39:00.238-->00:39:05.243
essentially becomes a lot harder
if it goes against their
existing beliefs. So question we

00:39:08.980-->00:39:13.985
received uh recently was ok,
well if both sides are using
this do the effects equal each

00:39:18.890-->00:39:24.495
other out? Uh and I thought
about that and though oh yeah in
theory they sort of do, uh or

00:39:24.495-->00:39:31.236
could do. But this, and, and
another potential theory is that
it's possible that one side has

00:39:31.236-->00:39:36.808
a home team advantage
essentially. Um, so one of the
ways they'd have a home team

00:39:36.808-->00:39:42.814
advantage is, well if you'd got
momentum on your side um then
you can go with that and just

00:39:42.814-->00:39:48.286
like double down on it. So here
we see the shuttin down the dark
net question um and a level of

00:39:48.286-->00:39:53.858
support for it. Well if you just
go with that and just increase
the, the already existing fears

00:39:53.858-->00:40:00.131
that people have. Um, you, it's
going to be a lot harder to be
in the defense, to, to defend

00:40:00.131-->00:40:06.938
that ar- that argument, than it
is to attack the argument if you
like. Uh there's a lot uh the

00:40:06.938-->00:40:13.444
role of uh, of fear. So, uh if
you've not see it there's a
great video on line by Dee

00:40:13.444-->00:40:18.449
Madigan on propaganda. And Dee
Madigan is a Australian uh,
campaign advertiser. And does a,

00:40:23.021-->00:40:28.960
a really fantastic talk. And she
talks about the uh effect of
fear based advertising. And she,

00:40:28.960-->00:40:33.731
she says yeah, people have said
that, have said to her that
negative campaigns really such

00:40:33.731-->00:40:38.736
and they don't' work on my. And
her comment was essentially
that, yes negative campaigns do

00:40:41.472-->00:40:46.477
work and that's why we do them.
Um, something like that. Anyway,
paraphrasing. But uh, the fear

00:40:48.546-->00:40:54.385
actually, or increasing fear
works. We've seen some studies
on that as well from Brader in

00:40:54.385-->00:41:00.692
2005. That shows how political
ads motivate and persuade voters
uh based on emotion. People, uh,

00:41:00.692-->00:41:05.697
people have higher attention for
uh ads that are, uh create more,
more fear if you like. And you

00:41:09.000-->00:41:14.005
saw grainy black and white
images versus ads that have a, a
lower um, versus ads that you

00:41:16.975-->00:41:22.080
use pictures of smiling children
if you like in front of flags
and you know all that kind of

00:41:22.080-->00:41:28.619
good stuff. So people's
attention is drawn to the more
negative ads in the first place.

00:41:28.619-->00:41:33.791
So ok, some thoughts on how, um
how folks might or how society
might begin tackling the

00:41:33.791-->00:41:39.797
problem. One of the things we
saw that the effective cognitive
biases in the EU referendum uh

00:41:39.797-->00:41:45.370
research that we've, we've done.
And that research we're going to
be talking about at the

00:41:45.370-->00:41:49.574
international conference on
political psychology in October.
And we've teamed up with some

00:41:49.574-->00:41:56.147
researchers at Missouri State,
to, to help us tackle the
challenge of uh, uh extremely

00:41:56.147-->00:42:01.085
non-normal data. Uh, but one of
the ways we can tackle this is,
uh or tackle effective cognitive

00:42:03.421-->00:42:09.727
biases is perhaps adopt a method
that, uh, this lady here Jane
Elliott had used. And if you're

00:42:09.727-->00:42:15.400
not familiar with Jane Elliott's
work, she basically splits um,
participants, it was with

00:42:15.400-->00:42:19.003
children in a classroom but
she's done this with older
group, into people with blue or

00:42:19.003-->00:42:24.942
brown eyes, uh and uses that as
the basis for helping educate
about racism and the effects of

00:42:24.942-->00:42:29.313
racism and kind of how that
works. So, it's possible that
you could do something similar

00:42:29.313-->00:42:34.185
with, in relation to, to
cognitive biases to make people
aware of that. Um, which would

00:42:34.185-->00:42:38.723
have benefits outside the
political campaigns to prevent
people getting hustled at uh,

00:42:38.723-->00:42:44.562
car dealerships and stuff like
that. The other thing we noticed
is that levels of numeracy were

00:42:44.562-->00:42:50.001
right, really shockingly poor in
the UK. And I don't think the
UK, uh the US is a great deal

00:42:50.001-->00:42:55.006
better. Um, so increasing
people's numerical literacy
skills is being able to

00:42:57.175-->00:43:02.113
determine that 1-->000 % APR is a
bad deal on a credit card. Um,
but it also has effects quite,

00:43:05.049-->00:43:10.087
um you, uh, it also has effects
in people choosing medical
options and what not as, as

00:43:10.087-->00:43:14.992
well. There's a lot of research
actually in that area liter-,
risk literacy and like making

00:43:14.992-->00:43:20.965
medical based uh choices. So,
that needs increasing I think uh
all around as well in addition

00:43:20.965-->00:43:25.369
to the biases. And then the next
thing which I think is going to
be a lot harder to achieve

00:43:25.369-->00:43:29.307
because literally anyone can do
this, so if you've got big
pockets you're going to get ya

00:43:29.307-->00:43:35.413
know, a lot more attraction. Is
really start enforcing or going
after people who are uh abusing

00:43:35.413-->00:43:40.418
this sort of, uh this sort of
political advertising. So, that
wraps up the uh, the

00:43:42.753-->00:43:48.192
presentation. I'm sure folks
will have uh, questions. You can
reach me at uh, chris at

00:43:48.192-->00:43:54.031
onlineprivacyfoundation dot org.
Um, I'm happy to address
questions afterwards but we'll

00:43:54.031-->00:43:59.403
have to go outside somewhere I
think. And I'll leave some uh,
some cards on the table if folks

00:43:59.403-->00:44:04.342
have questions. Aright? Thanks
very much. [applause]
