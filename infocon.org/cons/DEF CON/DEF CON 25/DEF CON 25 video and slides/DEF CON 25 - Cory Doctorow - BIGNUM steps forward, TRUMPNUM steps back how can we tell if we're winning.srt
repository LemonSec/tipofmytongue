00:00:00.000-->00:00:05.439
>>Uh, so thank you all very
much, its a pleasure to see you
all, uh in addition to being uh

00:00:05.439-->00:00:09.743
a normal Def Con talk, this is
actually also the last stop in a
book tour that I've been on

00:00:09.743-->00:00:14.748
since April, 35 cities, 3
countries, uh I this is my final
resting place on this tour, I am

00:00:17.551-->00:00:22.556
uh I've been waiting since April
the 4th to tell this joke, I am
now touring complete [laughter]

00:00:25.292-->00:00:30.297
[applause]. And you are the only
audience that I could tell that
joke too [laughter]. So, it's

00:00:34.401-->00:00:39.306
uniquely appropriate that I
finish here. So, uh uh uh as a
little bit of housekeeping when

00:00:39.306-->00:00:44.111
this is done adpro pro the tour
I'll be signing copies of my
book Walk Away uh in the

00:00:44.111-->00:00:48.148
retailer's room at the no starch
booth, they very kindly brought
in a few hundred copies of Walk

00:00:48.148-->00:00:53.820
Away and I -I hope to see you
there. But lets screw the bougie
commerce and lets get down to

00:00:53.820-->00:00:59.626
brass tacks here, uh in November
2013, a guy named Tom Wheeler
was appointed to run the federal

00:00:59.626-->00:01:04.932
communications commission uh he
was a former former cable
lobbyist who is now going to be

00:01:04.932-->00:01:10.604
in charge of regulating the
cable industry. Uh memorably
John Oliver went on TV to

00:01:10.604-->00:01:15.609
explain why this might not be a
bad idea, called Tom Wheeler a
dingo babysitter. Um, and then,

00:01:18.312-->00:01:24.685
a funny thing happened on the
way to regulation which is that
millions and millions of people

00:01:24.685-->00:01:28.822
called the FCC, and wrote to the
FCC, and called their
congressmen, and showed up in

00:01:28.822-->00:01:35.128
person and showed up outside Tom
Wheeler's house everyday at the
end of his driveway with signs.

00:01:35.128-->00:01:40.133
And then, on February 26, 2015
uh Tom Wheeler created a title 2
role for a network neutrality

00:01:43.570-->00:01:49.276
that said that ISPs couldn't
give preference to uh different
packets based on who had bribed

00:01:49.276-->00:01:55.182
them the most to carry them to
you. He also said, that states
that had passed laws that said

00:01:55.182-->00:01:59.319
that cities couldn't provide
their own networks to compete
with the crummy overpriced

00:01:59.319-->00:02:04.624
networks that the monopolies
were provided that um those
states were violating the FCC's

00:02:04.624-->00:02:09.963
rules, and that cities if they
wanted to could create networks
for the people who lived in

00:02:09.963-->00:02:14.968
them. And then, yeah that was
good news, the story gets dark
though cause on January the

00:02:17.170-->00:02:22.175
20th, Donald Trump was sworn in
I know, and he appointed a new
dingo babysitter. Uh a guy named

00:02:27.180-->00:02:32.185
Ajit Pai, also a former cable
lobbyist. Uh and he hated
network neutrality and announced

00:02:35.889-->00:02:42.696
that his first order of business
would be dismantling it. And on
July 12th, 8 million people sent

00:02:42.696-->00:02:47.701
comments to the FCC about this,
significantly more than had ever
lobbied the FCC on it a year

00:02:51.004-->00:02:55.075
before. Now, we don't know what
Pai is going to do at this
point, we don't know if we're

00:02:55.075-->00:03:00.814
winning or losing the fight for
network neutrality. But, winning
or losing is the wrong way to

00:03:00.814-->00:03:05.819
understand this kind of problem.
Because political process, like
security is a process and not a

00:03:08.121-->00:03:14.694
product, and it's a process
governed by 4 forces. Lawrence
Lessig wrote this book Code and

00:03:14.694-->00:03:21.435
the other laws of cyberspace in
1999 in which he said that our
world is regulated by code, it's

00:03:21.435-->00:03:27.407
what's technologically possible,
markets that's what's
profitable, law, what's legal,

00:03:27.407-->00:03:32.412
and norms, what's socially
acceptable. And what happens in
our world is the result of those

00:03:35.715-->00:03:42.422
4 factors coming together; law,
code, norms and markets. So,
let's look at where net

00:03:42.422-->00:03:47.427
neutrality stands according to
Lessig's analysis. Well, code,
uh Tim Woo coined the term

00:03:49.496-->00:03:54.401
network neutrality uh old school
chum of mine, I lost touch with
him for 20 years, he sent me an

00:03:54.401-->00:03:58.572
email saying uh I just found you
on the internet and by the way
I'm really sorry for shooting

00:03:58.572-->00:04:03.510
your dwarf in the back with a
crossbow in 1980 [laughter]. Um,
Tim Woo, uh went to work for the

00:04:05.612-->00:04:09.282
Federal trade commission in or
the uh sorry not the federal
trade commission, the New York

00:04:09.282-->00:04:15.589
Attorney General's office and uh
distributed open sourced tools
to New Yorkers to measure

00:04:15.589-->00:04:22.496
network performance across uh
the internet uh service being
offered by the duopoly in New

00:04:22.496-->00:04:29.136
York state, and he sent an open
letter to Time Warner cable
saying in advertisement after

00:04:29.136-->00:04:34.107
advertisement Time warner
promised a quote blaton fast,
super reliable internet

00:04:34.107-->00:04:39.112
connection, yet it appears the
company has been failing to take
adequate or necessary steps to

00:04:39.112-->00:04:44.151
keep pace with the demand of the
Time Warner cable customers at
times letting communi-

00:04:44.151-->00:04:49.089
connections with key internet
content providers become so
congested that large volumes of

00:04:49.089-->00:04:55.028
internet data were regularly
lost or discarded. So, code is
on our side right? Now we know

00:04:55.028-->00:05:01.234
the full extent of cable company
F***ery. We can measure it and
report on it to the byte level

00:05:01.234-->00:05:06.239
in real time. So code is looking
good. How about law? Law is
looking dubious. So we have this

00:05:08.975-->00:05:14.681
title 2 rule, it's a year old,
uh what the FCC can and can't do
is set bylaw, congress would

00:05:14.681-->00:05:20.554
need to pass a new law to change
how the FCC works, congress is
not going to pass any laws

00:05:20.554-->00:05:25.125
anytime soon, I don't know if
you've noticed, but they're not
making laws these days

00:05:25.125-->00:05:30.297
[laughter] and so the laws kind
of ambivalent because maybe Ajit
Pai can get the commissioners to

00:05:30.297-->00:05:36.403
vote down title 2, maybe not,
we'll see, certainly there's a
lot of people who have put him

00:05:36.403-->00:05:41.942
on notice that this would be
terrible idea and while we were
away while the network

00:05:41.942-->00:05:47.180
neutrality uh rule was in place
what happened was the cable
operators started to get on

00:05:47.180-->00:05:52.352
investor phone calls where they
had to make full disclosures or
face personal criminal liability

00:05:52.352-->00:05:58.058
under Dodd Frank, so lying on
those phone calls can send you
to jail, and they started to say

00:05:58.058-->00:06:02.062
something really different when
they could go to jail for lying
than they did when they were

00:06:02.062-->00:06:08.368
just talking to the press. And
what they started to say was
actually network neutrality not

00:06:08.368-->00:06:11.771
network neutrality doesn't
matter we're gonna build out our
networks no matter what, our

00:06:11.771-->00:06:17.577
investment is strong, it doesn't
matter if this rule is in place
or not. So um, we do have some

00:06:17.577-->00:06:21.715
good facts and evidence that we
can bring to the likes of Ajit
Pai who says that network

00:06:21.715-->00:06:25.886
neutrality causes under
investment in American
broadband. Now how about

00:06:25.886-->00:06:30.891
markets, markets are really
serious trouble here, right the
most concentrated industry, the

00:06:33.693-->00:06:38.698
first really concentrated modern
industry is telcoms and their
buying online companies now so

00:06:41.534-->00:06:46.806
the companies used to fight them
to say don't uh congest your
pipes on purpose to stop our

00:06:46.806-->00:06:53.313
customers from seeing uh our
pages, those companies are now
part of the um the phone

00:06:53.313-->00:06:59.085
company, like verizon owns
tumblr now. Tumblr was one of
the great proponents of net

00:06:59.085-->00:07:04.024
neutrality a year ago, this year
they were a little weak kneed.
Or Netflix right? Netflix a year

00:07:06.693-->00:07:12.232
ago Netflix lead the charge on
network neutrality this year on
one of those phone calls where

00:07:12.232-->00:07:17.871
you have to tell the truth or
you go to jail, CEO said very
frankly eh network neutrality's

00:07:17.871-->00:07:23.310
not as important to the survival
of our business as it was a year
ago cause everyone loves Netflix

00:07:23.310-->00:07:27.814
now and if a cable operator
started to screw with Netflix
they would face so much backlash

00:07:27.814-->00:07:32.419
from our customers who are there
customers that we could probably
win that fight. Now we'll still

00:07:32.419-->00:07:36.990
fight for network neutrality but
it's not an existential threat
for us and even taking Madas

00:07:36.990-->00:07:40.894
word and I don't know why you
wouldn't take Madas word, I
think he's telling the truth, I

00:07:40.894-->00:07:45.298
think it's facially obvious that
netflix will fight harder for
something that is an existential

00:07:45.298-->00:07:51.004
threat to the business than they
will for something that they
view is a good idea, so that's

00:07:51.004-->00:07:57.243
bad news. But how about norms?
Norms are where the good news
starts. People care about

00:07:57.243-->00:08:02.882
network neutrality. Saying that
network neutrality is not a good
idea, makes you sound like a

00:08:02.882-->00:08:07.887
colossal a**hole [laughter].
Network neutrality is counted as
a victory one that people have a

00:08:10.957-->00:08:17.263
stake in defending as opposed to
some weird idea which it was a
year ago that most people

00:08:17.263-->00:08:22.869
weren't even sure what it was. 8
million people sent comments to
the FCC about network

00:08:22.869-->00:08:28.141
neutrality. There's evidence in
hand that network neutrality
does not impact telecoms

00:08:28.141-->00:08:33.146
infrastructure investment. Norms
are huge we have millions of
Americans who in the last year

00:08:37.150-->00:08:42.155
have formed strong opinions
about telecoms policy. I mean
even I find it difficult to

00:08:45.325-->00:08:49.662
remain engaged when people are
talking about telecoms
[snoring], so are we winning or

00:08:49.662-->00:08:54.667
losing on telecoms policy? Well
both. Last year we leveraged
norms to win a legal battle,

00:08:58.004-->00:09:03.977
this year the legal side pushed
back helped by the market and
government got bought out by big

00:09:03.977-->00:09:09.349
Telco, but this year we got
bigger norms to push back with
because the politicians who got

00:09:09.349-->00:09:14.821
bought out by big Telco, they
also got elected by online
ground swells net roots groups

00:09:14.821-->00:09:21.594
that really care about network
neutrality and the politicians
may also realize that incumbency

00:09:21.594-->00:09:27.333
is better served by controllable
internet than by a wild one
right? Having achieved uh

00:09:27.333-->00:09:32.238
victory and gotten elected by
insurgent grassroots movements,
they would like those insurgent

00:09:32.238-->00:09:35.942
grassroots movements to go away
so that they don't throw them
out and put someone new in there

00:09:35.942-->00:09:41.781
see, so it's hard to know but we
don't need to know, we don't
need to pay attention because

00:09:41.781-->00:09:47.887
winning or losing is the wrong
sort of question. The right
question is how do we win more

00:09:47.887-->00:09:52.826
than we are right now and how do
we make our adversaries lose
more than they are right now.

00:09:52.826-->00:09:58.098
This is a security problem, it
is a process and not a product.
When you're red teaming your

00:09:58.098-->00:10:03.103
adversaries you look for weak
points and you attack them with
your strengths and our strength

00:10:03.103-->00:10:10.109
on network neutrality is norms.
Network neutrality is not about
regulating the internet telecoms

00:10:10.109-->00:10:16.816
is regulation uh if you think
about what a telecom is it's a
bunch of rules saying you're

00:10:16.816-->00:10:21.120
allowed to go and stick poles on
every corner and dig up every
sidewalk of every city in

00:10:21.120-->00:10:26.359
America along with all of the
rights of way along all the
railroad tracks in America at

00:10:26.359-->00:10:31.498
knock down prices without having
to negotiate with every
retailer, every individual,

00:10:31.498-->00:10:36.469
every government for the right
to dig up that sidewalk and in
exchange you get to be our phone

00:10:36.469-->00:10:41.841
company. Without a regulation
there is no phone company right?
You can't go golf with your

00:10:41.841-->00:10:45.411
phone company and pay market
rates for your sidewalk
clearance. I mean maybe you

00:10:45.411-->00:10:50.850
could but a trillion dollars
later you'd still be arguing
with that one person in Brooklyn

00:10:50.850-->00:10:55.622
who wants artisanal sidewalk
digging and refuses to let your
guys in [laughter] to dig it up

00:10:55.622-->00:11:01.327
and complete your last mile. So
we're not arguing about whether
there should be regulation,

00:11:01.327-->00:11:06.299
we're just arguing about whether
the regulation should serve the
public or the telecoms giants

00:11:06.299-->00:11:10.703
who've been profiting at the
expense of the public. Who will
win this time is the wrong

00:11:10.703-->00:11:15.708
question, I mean it would rock
to get Ajit Pai to do a total
climb down on his hard core

00:11:17.877-->00:11:22.382
commitment to destroy net
neutrality but it would also
work for him to screw over

00:11:22.382-->00:11:28.388
network neutrality and then take
his a** to court and hand him
his a** in the courtroom, either

00:11:28.388-->00:11:33.927
one would be a huge moral boost,
either one would do great on the
normative side, either one would

00:11:33.927-->00:11:39.933
create a lot more net neutrality
stakeholders who thought of
themselves as pirates not as

00:11:39.933-->00:11:45.371
admirals because remember every
pirate wants to be an admiral,
and yesterday's pirates always

00:11:45.371-->00:11:49.943
turn into admirals who say when
I did it that was totally legit,
when you do it that's totally

00:11:49.943-->00:11:56.549
wrong. So, telecoms at
competition advocates, we
thought we won in 1982 when we

00:11:56.549-->00:12:01.487
got AT &T broken up, we thought
we won when the net heads beat
the bell heads at AT&T and

00:12:03.856-->00:12:09.662
circuit switching declined and
packet switching grew but then
the carriers came back because

00:12:09.662-->00:12:14.667
of course they did our victory
uh over uh AT&T our victory over
packet switching, neither one of

00:12:18.204-->00:12:23.176
those things turned all those
greedy anti-competitive super
villains to become like

00:12:23.176-->00:12:29.616
buddhists right? They didn't
lose, they just had a technical,
legal business and normative set

00:12:29.616-->00:12:34.754
back and so they worked at the
margins like lord voldemort
lurking on the back of someone's

00:12:34.754-->00:12:41.427
head waiting to find a new body
[laughter] bringing their powers
back to bare and it helped of

00:12:41.427-->00:12:45.798
course the finance capital
devoured the world around the
same time, meaning they had

00:12:45.798-->00:12:51.638
fewer and fewer limits on the
ways they could use raw cash to
buy political outcomes. Maybe

00:12:51.638-->00:12:55.241
we'll be able to spend them,
maybe we'll be able to buy more
politicians than them because

00:12:55.241-->00:13:01.214
the total value of the ecosystem
that they want to strangle with
their neutracidal ways uh

00:13:01.214-->00:13:06.586
exceeds the market cap of all
the telecoms companies by orders
of magnitudes, they just own the

00:13:06.586-->00:13:11.291
pipes, the stuff that's in the
pipes is what matters but every
pirate wants to be an admiral,

00:13:11.291-->00:13:15.762
and so the insurgents who are
bank rolling net neutrality
fights today will become

00:13:15.762-->00:13:20.933
tomorrow's telecom chums uh
happy to slip big ISP a few
bucks for premium carriage if it

00:13:20.933-->00:13:26.172
means the upstart competitors
that friend due to them what
they did to last years pirates

00:13:26.172-->00:13:32.512
uh uh could be walled off from
their customers, it's like that
last line in Animal Farm, the

00:13:32.512-->00:13:37.150
creatures look from the pig to
the man and from the man to the
pig and from the pig to the man

00:13:37.150-->00:13:43.956
again and already it was
impossible to say which was
which. So it's useless to ask

00:13:43.956-->00:13:48.961
whether the companies are on our
side or not, coke does not want
to buy the world a coke,

00:13:53.266-->00:13:59.439
companies are not on our side
the right question is how do we
get companies to see that our

00:13:59.439-->00:14:05.278
side is in their temporary
advantage and when can we rely
on companies to help us out. So

00:14:05.278-->00:14:10.817
let's apply that to some other
issues like back doors, so EFF
we made our bones fighting back

00:14:10.817-->00:14:16.422
doors 1992 we won this Bernstein
law suit where Daniel J
Bernstein DJB had published

00:14:16.422-->00:14:20.927
source code that allowed him to
implement cypher stronger than
the one that the NSA thought

00:14:20.927-->00:14:27.867
civilians should have access too
and at the time uh everybody
thought that it was a hopeless

00:14:27.867-->00:14:33.606
fight EFF brought a legal
challenge we said that DJB had
the first amendment right to

00:14:33.606-->00:14:37.710
publish source code, that source
code was a form of expressive
speech that programmers use to

00:14:37.710-->00:14:42.215
express their ideas and the
ninth circuit at the lower
division and the apal division

00:14:42.215-->00:14:47.220
both upheld us and cryptos been
legal to use since then that's
why this con exists thats why

00:14:47.220-->00:14:52.225
your jobs exist. You know, the
odds were stacked against us in
market and norms and in code um

00:14:57.263-->00:15:02.368
you know there was uh this this
idea that DES 50 this this very
weak cypher would be enough to

00:15:02.368-->00:15:08.407
defend all of uh all of American
business, all of American
enterprise, all of American

00:15:08.407-->00:15:14.847
activity and um we would say
well that cyphers super weak and
it doesn't work and the

00:15:14.847-->00:15:18.851
congressional oversight for the
NSA would say well the NSA has
hired all the best

00:15:18.851-->00:15:22.955
mathematicians that graduated
form all the best universities
for 30 years and they say it's

00:15:22.955-->00:15:28.094
fine who the h**l are you? So
you know we set out to prove it,
John Gilmore helped find, found

00:15:28.094-->00:15:33.266
EFF early in play in some
microsystems, he built a
computer called a DES cracker he

00:15:33.266-->00:15:37.770
built a computer that for a
quarter million dollars could
brute force the whole key space

00:15:37.770-->00:15:42.775
of DES 50 in two hours and he
said this is the cost of honing
the entire American finance

00:15:44.811-->00:15:49.282
system as well as all of our
political communications, global
or personal communications,

00:15:49.282-->00:15:54.453
quarter million bucks, 2 hours
right? That is a good return on
your investment, everybody

00:15:54.453-->00:15:59.458
should build a DES cracker
[laughter] but it didn't help.
Now, what did help was arguing

00:16:02.261-->00:16:07.099
that the first amendment
protected programmers and the
first amendment obviously only

00:16:07.099-->00:16:11.637
applies in America, I'm not an
American, I'm Canadian, we're
like serial killers, we look

00:16:11.637-->00:16:18.411
like everybody else and we're
everywhere um [laughter] but the
first amendment turned out to

00:16:18.411-->00:16:23.783
have a way that it could apply
to everyone in the world which
is that once the US made it

00:16:23.783-->00:16:30.389
legal to make strong crypto, it
became the guardian of the
world's working cryptography any

00:16:30.389-->00:16:34.560
other country that proposed to
ban working cryptography would
have people show up and say it

00:16:34.560-->00:16:38.865
doesn't matter if you ban
working cryptography because the
US will just keep exporting

00:16:38.865-->00:16:44.403
strong crypto to our
constituencies and all that
you'll get is that our industry

00:16:44.403-->00:16:48.674
won't be able to participate in
the crypto market place. So
these US fights, they're really

00:16:48.674-->00:16:55.081
important, that's why people all
over the world watch so closely
when the FBI tried to get um

00:16:55.081-->00:16:59.785
apple to backdoor its phones to
read what the San Bernardino
killers had been talking about

00:16:59.785-->00:17:04.223
before they went on their
shooting spree. So, what is
Lessig's four factors have to

00:17:04.223-->00:17:08.561
say about backdoors? How about
norms, well we've had these
super high powered breeches

00:17:08.561-->00:17:13.766
lately there was vault 7, there
was shadow brokers and those
gave rise to things like

00:17:13.766-->00:17:18.571
wannacry right where you have
this ransomware worm that's
shutting down key systems all

00:17:18.571-->00:17:23.476
over the world and one of the
things that rarely got discussed
in the world of wannacry is what

00:17:23.476-->00:17:27.446
the ransom was, does anyone know
how much the ransom was in
dollars [inaudible] $300 right?

00:17:27.446-->00:17:30.883
These guys were seizing whole
hospitals and asking for $300,
this was not Lex Luthor, these

00:17:30.883-->00:17:35.888
guys [laughter] were dumb dumbs,
they were dumb dumbs that got
there hands on superweapons

00:17:44.797-->00:17:49.802
developed at taxpayer expense
right all of a sudden people
woke up and said maybe the idea

00:17:52.338-->00:17:56.909
that vulnerabilities that
governments discover in commonly
used systems that they don't

00:17:56.909-->00:18:02.214
patch maybe those will get
independently discovered or
leaked and used by dumb dumbs

00:18:02.214-->00:18:07.687
not just like North Korea but
like that crackhead who broke
your car window for the quarter

00:18:07.687-->00:18:12.692
you left on your dashboard
[laughter] is gonna get there
hands on these crazy cyber

00:18:12.692-->00:18:18.698
weapons. There in the normative
sphere, there's no evidence of
anyone going dark right? Every

00:18:18.698-->00:18:24.036
Time law enforcement is made to
show its work when it says you
know we can't police anyone

00:18:24.036-->00:18:27.907
anymore because the terrorists
are going dark you ask them like
have the terrorists gone dark

00:18:27.907-->00:18:32.278
like where's your evidence of it
there like wellll they haven't
gone dark yet I mean technically

00:18:32.278-->00:18:37.783
we just keep being able to spy
on everyone all the time and
like you know the the paris uh

00:18:37.783-->00:18:42.455
attackers they ditched a laptop
uh in a garbage can with an
unencrypted hard drive and a

00:18:42.455-->00:18:47.460
folder on the desktop labeled
secret terror plans [laughter]
but someday they're gonna go

00:18:50.096-->00:18:54.367
dark I mean we know it right
like someday this plane might
crash and that's why I'm gonna

00:18:54.367-->00:18:59.372
eat my seat mate now [laughter].
So, the normative side is
looking pretty good, but it's

00:19:03.843-->00:19:08.114
not perfect uh there's lots of
hysteria about the dark net, if
any of you saw Roger Dingledine

00:19:08.114-->00:19:13.319
talk yesterday about about dark
net hysteria um it's totally
true that crypto uh that

00:19:13.319-->00:19:17.857
ransomware and crypto currencies
have become the inseparable
peanut butter and chocolate of

00:19:17.857-->00:19:23.095
s***y crime in the 21st century
and not only that but like it's
also become the thing that real

00:19:23.095-->00:19:27.099
world kidnappers are now using
to cash out on their
kidnappings, bitcoins and other

00:19:27.099-->00:19:32.304
coins, so it's a mixed bag on
norms. How about markets? Well
the market news is pretty good,

00:19:32.304-->00:19:36.842
it turns out that people want
products that protect their
privacy. Uh full disc encryption

00:19:36.842-->00:19:41.847
is now standard uh whats app is
is uh implementing end to end
encryption for uh billions of

00:19:44.483-->00:19:49.288
messaging users all around the
world and putting competitive
pressure on everyone else to

00:19:49.288-->00:19:54.493
match them and exceed them, but
the bad news is that there's
still a lot of money to be made

00:19:54.493-->00:20:00.633
from spying on your customers.
Uh last year Henrich Mulka and
others reported that AT&T were

00:20:00.633-->00:20:05.104
making tens of millions of
dollars a year selling their
customers data secretly and

00:20:05.104-->00:20:11.677
illegally to the NSA and the
zero day trade is alive and well
and countries around the world

00:20:11.677-->00:20:17.249
that are not well
technologically developed and
have no IT capacity to speak of

00:20:17.249-->00:20:21.253
are never the less able to enact
super ambitious mass
surveillance programs like in

00:20:21.253-->00:20:26.225
Ethiopia where they buy in tools
from companies like hacking team
to spy on everyone in the

00:20:26.225-->00:20:32.731
country even though no uh uh
indigenous I uh well developed
IT industry exists they can

00:20:32.731-->00:20:38.804
still spy like Americans um so
the market side is a bit of a
mixed bag. How about the Law?

00:20:38.804-->00:20:45.044
Well Bernstein is still the law
of the land it was uh challenged
a bit in 2000 over the 2600 case

00:20:45.044-->00:20:51.050
but it's still there um we have
some hard cases that have come
up uh on crypto, none have gone

00:20:51.050-->00:20:55.788
all the way through the courts,
which is good because hard cases
make bad law, uh judges are

00:20:55.788-->00:21:01.794
often willing to say um people
who commit acts of terror don't
aren't entitled to privacy uh

00:21:01.794-->00:21:06.565
and are indifferent to all the
people who didn't commit an act
of terror who will be implicated

00:21:06.565-->00:21:11.570
by that privacy decision uh we
have uh a burgeoning idea around
the world that the law should

00:21:13.706-->00:21:17.543
not protect cryptography and in
fact should mandate that no one
should have access to working

00:21:17.543-->00:21:22.414
cryptography. You may have seen
that Australia has planned in an
upcoming meeting of the five

00:21:22.414-->00:21:27.353
eyes countries, Australia,
Canada, New Zealand the US and
the UK to propose that all five

00:21:27.353-->00:21:32.658
of those countries ban working
crypto and mandate backdoors in
all of their uh products uh the

00:21:32.658-->00:21:38.130
uh that wasn't enough the prime
minister of Australia recently
said in public with a straight

00:21:38.130-->00:21:43.402
face that the laws of
mathematics are all well and
good but the law in Australia is

00:21:43.402-->00:21:48.407
the law of Australia [laughter].
You know nerds nerd harder
[laughter]. Uh in the UK they

00:21:54.380-->00:22:00.085
passed a surveillance bill that
uh makes 1984 look like a manual
for state craft, China has

00:22:00.085-->00:22:04.690
banned VPNs and the major app
stores including Googles and
Apple are collaborating to

00:22:04.690-->00:22:09.795
remove VPNs that aren't man in
the middle from mobile app
stores, so the law side, not

00:22:09.795-->00:22:15.501
looking so good. The code side,
well the code side obviously
looks great cause crypto works

00:22:15.501-->00:22:20.506
right? Crypto works and the bad
news is that increasingly um we
are using devices that don't see

00:22:23.409-->00:22:28.180
themselves as your servants but
as your adversaries right?
Devices that are designed to

00:22:28.180-->00:22:33.452
make sure that you only use one
kind of printer cartridge or
that you only tie into one app

00:22:33.452-->00:22:37.890
store ecosystem or in some other
way that you conduct your
affairs to the benefit of the

00:22:37.890-->00:22:42.394
shareholders of the company that
made the product instead of your
own and in those cases those

00:22:42.394-->00:22:47.099
devices are designed to run code
that you're not supposed to even
know is there and that if you

00:22:47.099-->00:22:51.570
know it's there you can't find
and if you find it you can't
disable it or change it because

00:22:51.570-->00:22:55.374
if you can go in and say like
I'd like to buy my apps from a
different store please, then

00:22:55.374-->00:23:01.280
that whole model breaks down.
And then in the middle um we
have uh we have uh some some

00:23:01.280-->00:23:06.285
reasonably ok news um for the
code side where were getting
really good examples of how bad

00:23:08.787-->00:23:15.294
code really puts people at risk
um you know the there's itunes
uh being use, the updater

00:23:15.294-->00:23:20.099
mechanism being used by
FinFisher to push malware that
is a product they sold to

00:23:20.099-->00:23:25.704
governments uh you could push
malware into itunes instances by
masquerading as a software

00:23:25.704-->00:23:29.308
update that immediately
triggered better security
practices on the part of apple

00:23:29.308-->00:23:33.779
and was a warning to everyone
who has unauthenticated software
updates that this is bad news

00:23:33.779-->00:23:39.918
and could uh make really hard
problems for your customers and
your business. So backdoors,

00:23:39.918-->00:23:44.423
kind of in the middle, we've got
a little strength on the on the
norm side, the law sides ok, the

00:23:44.423-->00:23:49.428
code side looks amazing uh let's
use code to uh try and push the
law. Now how about uh DRM?

00:23:54.333-->00:24:00.673
Section 1201 of the DMCA the war
on general purpose computing
right? The idea uh very dumb

00:24:00.673-->00:24:05.678
idea that um I can give you a
device that has a key to decrypt
messages from me uh but that

00:24:08.781-->00:24:14.586
that key is hidden in the device
somehow so that only programs
that I provide can access that

00:24:14.586-->00:24:16.588
key and those programs can
access that key and those
programs will do what I tell

00:24:16.588-->00:24:21.160
them to do, like throw away the
cleartext when it's done, that
ideas like completely bankrupt

00:24:21.160-->00:24:25.164
we don't hide keys in equipment
that we give to our adversaries
for the same reason that we

00:24:25.164-->00:24:29.802
don't keep bank safes in bank
robbers living rooms right?
[laughter] because this is not

00:24:29.802-->00:24:36.241
Alice, and Bob and Carol, or
Alice and Bob and Eve, it's just
Alice and Bob right? Alice is uh

00:24:36.241-->00:24:40.879
like anyone in the world who
wants to get a netflix account
and Bob is netflix and bob gives

00:24:40.879-->00:24:45.017
anyone who signs up for a
netflix account a copy of the
netflix client with the netflix

00:24:45.017-->00:24:49.488
keys hidden in it in hopes that
none of those Alice's including
like the bored grad students

00:24:49.488-->00:24:52.858
with electron tunneling
microscopes nothing to do in a
weekend and a bunch of grad uh

00:24:52.858-->00:24:57.062
undergrads hanging around like a
bad smell, that none of them
look to hard at that stuff that

00:24:57.062-->00:25:02.401
netflix just gave them and
figure out where the keys are.
So, DRM is dumb, but it's not

00:25:02.401-->00:25:09.108
harmless. Because of the very
fragility of DRM, DRM advocates,
the companies that like DRM,

00:25:09.108-->00:25:13.712
they're not interested in the
technology of DRM, they're not
interested in making proprietary

00:25:13.712-->00:25:18.550
software that hides decryption
keys from the users and discards
cleartext, what they really want

00:25:18.550-->00:25:24.289
is the law that comes with DRM.
So, once you make DRM and put it
in a product, once you have a- a

00:25:24.289-->00:25:29.928
means of access control for
copyrighted work, you can invoke
laws like uh section 1201 of the

00:25:29.928-->00:25:35.401
DMCA in the US, in Europe its
implementations of article 6 of
the UCV, I could go on, every

00:25:35.401-->00:25:40.506
country in the world except
Israel has a law that bans
breaking DRM. Uh US trade

00:25:40.506-->00:25:45.511
representative had other
priorities in respect to Israel.
Um, and these laws, they say

00:25:47.913-->00:25:54.153
that tampering with a copyright
lock, disabling that copyright
lock, weakening that copyright

00:25:54.153-->00:26:00.692
lock are both criminal and civil
acts, in the US it's a $500-->000
fine and a 5 year prison

00:26:00.692-->00:26:05.697
sentence for a first offense for
weakening a- a digital lock on a
copyrighted work. So, what this

00:26:09.234-->00:26:14.139
law has come to mean is that a
corporation can force you to use
your property in the way that

00:26:14.139-->00:26:20.712
they want you to on pain of
felonization of your activity.
If a phone vendor can make more

00:26:20.712-->00:26:24.683
money by making sure you only
buy apps from them and not from
a third party store and not

00:26:24.683-->00:26:29.388
directly from a software vendor,
all they need to do is design
their phone so that using anyone

00:26:29.388-->00:26:34.827
else's app store requires
bypassing DRM. and now,
bypass-uh using another app

00:26:34.827-->00:26:39.832
store is a felony. So,
conceptually, there's no
principal here, that separates

00:26:42.201-->00:26:47.539
deciding whose apps you can use
on a phone that you own from
whose bread you can use in a

00:26:47.539-->00:26:53.378
toaster you own. We are one
vision system away from toasters
that reject unauthorized bread

00:26:53.378-->00:26:57.983
[laughter] right? We are one
RFID system away from a
dishwasher that rejects

00:26:57.983-->00:27:02.020
unauthorized dishes. You can
make every argument that people
make for app stores, for

00:27:02.020-->00:27:05.824
toasters, for dishwashers,
right? Your toaster could burn
your house down if you stuck a

00:27:05.824-->00:27:10.262
bagel in it, that's why we have
to make sure that you're only
putting in authorized bread.

00:27:10.262-->00:27:14.299
Your dishwasher could kill you
with a foodborne illness if we
can't fully sterilize your

00:27:14.299-->00:27:19.638
dishes, that's why you can only
used authorized dishes. But
that's not the way it works in

00:27:19.638-->00:27:23.775
property regimes. In property,
if it's your property, you're
suppose to be able to decide

00:27:23.775-->00:27:29.214
what you do with it. If having
software and DRM in a device
means you don't get to decide

00:27:29.214-->00:27:33.352
how you use your property, it
stops being your property. You
know the definition that every

00:27:33.352-->00:27:38.924
law school teaches about what
property is, Blackwell on
property, property is that thing

00:27:38.924-->00:27:44.029
of the world in which man
possesses sole and despotic
dominion to the exclusion of all

00:27:44.029-->00:27:50.135
other men in the universe.
Right? You do not have sole and
despotic dominion over things uh

00:27:50.135-->00:27:55.340
that you aren't allowed to
configure and use in the way
that suits you best. Now, a

00:27:55.340-->00:27:59.778
bonus side effect of this from
the perspective of the
manufacturers, is they get to

00:27:59.778-->00:28:05.817
threaten security researchers
just like you. Because if I know
about a defect in a DRM system,

00:28:05.817-->00:28:10.923
I know how to start unraveling
that DRM system, removing that
DRM system and so these

00:28:10.923-->00:28:16.662
researchers have successfully
argued that weakening DRM system
by publishing security

00:28:16.662-->00:28:23.368
vulnerability reports is also a
felony. And at this conference,
a security researcher was

00:28:23.368-->00:28:29.775
dragged off stage by the FBI and
put in jail for reporting on
defects in a DRM system. The

00:28:29.775-->00:28:36.415
chilling effect of DRM is alive
and well. Security researchers
in 2015 went to US copyright

00:28:36.415-->00:28:41.620
office to report that they are
sitting on vulnerabilities, not
disclosing vulnerabilities in

00:28:41.620-->00:28:47.225
medical implants, in farming
vehicles, in passenger vehicles,
in voting machines, and more

00:28:47.225-->00:28:51.063
because they are worried about
getting jailed or sued for
disclosing defects in DRM and

00:28:51.063-->00:28:55.033
all of these things have DRM in
them because it lets the
manufacturers constrain how

00:28:55.033-->00:29:00.172
they're used. So, where do we
stand on DRM, well code, it's
not hard to break DRM, it's a

00:29:00.172-->00:29:05.944
fool's errand to make DRM, how
about markets well there's more
DRM than ever because it's an

00:29:05.944-->00:29:10.048
attractive nuisance, we've said
to companies add DRM, tell your
customers how to use your

00:29:10.048-->00:29:15.187
products it's making bank for
those companies, GM uses DRM to
lock up the telemetry on their

00:29:15.187-->00:29:20.192
cars and charges $75-->000 for a
tool to read out the telemetry
on your own car. Now this has

00:29:23.228-->00:29:28.767
huge costs for other sectors of
the economy, um if you want to
start a business to repair

00:29:28.767-->00:29:32.938
electronics or cars or whatever,
you can't do that without the
sufferance and say so of the

00:29:32.938-->00:29:38.176
original manufacturers, uh those
businesses are local by
definition, no one sends their

00:29:38.176-->00:29:42.614
car to India or China to get it
fixed, they don't even send
their phones to China or India

00:29:42.614-->00:29:48.420
to get it fixed and repair jobs
are much better than uh breaking
up this electronics and

00:29:48.420-->00:29:55.093
recycling it. A ton of e-waste
produces 15 jobs if it's
recycled, it produces 200 jobs

00:29:55.093-->00:30:00.932
if it's repaired. It's on share
and it's local, but the markets
are fighting back, uh, uh to

00:30:00.932-->00:30:06.438
make DRM the rule and to stop
these local businesses and these
local jobs from occurring. But

00:30:06.438-->00:30:12.944
it's markets could be a force
for breaking DRM uh, uh a team
of researchers at the University

00:30:12.944-->00:30:17.683
of Glasgow, uh published a paper
that we um helped them get
funding for by writing a letter

00:30:17.683-->00:30:23.555
in support of them uh economists
and and other kinds of data
scientists where they scraped

00:30:23.555-->00:30:29.327
a-a product category on Amazon,
DVD players to look at how um
the presence of an illegal

00:30:29.327-->00:30:35.100
circumvention feature affects
the price of a DVD player, and
what they found is that if you

00:30:35.100-->00:30:40.439
compare a set of DVD players on
Amazon of similar vintage with
similar numbers of reviews and

00:30:40.439-->00:30:46.011
similar overall ratings, that
the ones that have a-a primitive
DRM circumvention feature sell

00:30:46.011-->00:30:51.883
at a 50 percent premium,
compared to the ones that follow
the rules on DVD DRM. Now, the

00:30:51.883-->00:30:58.023
actual margin for a DVD player
is in the realm of 2 percent, so
you can increase your profits by

00:30:58.023-->00:31:02.961
25 fold just by adding minimal
DRM breaking features. So,
that's the market story, it

00:31:06.031-->00:31:09.835
could be could if we could
convince companies local
businesses that they should be

00:31:09.835-->00:31:14.339
bold and think about fighting to
break DRM and standing up for
the rights of their customers,

00:31:14.339-->00:31:17.976
the rights of their communities,
but it's pretty terrible because
big companies have figured out

00:31:17.976-->00:31:22.881
they can get a lot bigger if
they could use DRM to force you
to only conduct your affairs to

00:31:22.881-->00:31:28.353
their benefit. How about norms?
Well we are definitely at the
peak indifference to DRM.

00:31:28.353-->00:31:33.125
Everyday there's a new horrific
DRM story. People wake up and
they say, I had no idea that

00:31:33.125-->00:31:38.029
that's what that meant, whether
it's HP pushing a fake security
update to millions of inkjet

00:31:38.029-->00:31:42.534
owners that uh was posed as a
thing to protect your network
stack in your printer but was

00:31:42.534-->00:31:47.172
actually a thing that could
detect and reject third party
ink cartridges, or people

00:31:47.172-->00:31:52.711
finding out that they can't make
closed loop insulin pumps
because the DRM on one or both

00:31:52.711-->00:31:57.449
parts of it prevents them from
bypassing it to link up a
glucose monitor and an insulin

00:31:57.449-->00:32:03.155
pump. People are increasingly
aware that this is a rip off.
People are increasingly aware

00:32:03.155-->00:32:06.691
that telling security
researchers that they're not
allowed to disclose defects in

00:32:06.691-->00:32:11.830
products that are intimately
woven in your life does not make
you more secure. How about the

00:32:11.830-->00:32:18.503
law? Well the law is a mixed bag
too, a year ago Electronic
Frontier Foundation sued the US

00:32:18.503-->00:32:24.142
Government to invalidate section
1201 of the DMCA. We brought our
lawsuit on behalf of two people

00:32:24.142-->00:32:28.513
you may have heard of, two of my
favorite people in the world,
one is Andrew Bunny Huang, you

00:32:28.513-->00:32:35.053
may know him as the Xbox hacker
uh [applause] he's a dude, the
other one is Matthew Green at

00:32:35.053-->00:32:41.726
Johns Hopkins and um together
they represent a set of legal
challenges to section 1201 of

00:32:41.726-->00:32:44.763
the DMCA that will
comprehensively demolish it if
we win our suit. Uh, the

00:32:44.763-->00:32:48.233
government filed a motion to
dismiss, the courts have been
sitting on the motion, we have

00:32:48.233-->00:32:51.736
reason to believe we will hear
from them in the next month or
so, there's a thing where judges

00:32:51.736-->00:32:56.675
have to reply within a certain
number of months or they get
censured by their peers uh and

00:32:56.675-->00:33:01.613
um the period in which that that
censure is going to come up is
uh ends at the end of August, so

00:33:03.849-->00:33:09.788
we think we'll probably hear
pretty soon, we'll have more to
say then. Um, there's uh a new

00:33:09.788-->00:33:15.060
uh 1201 study from the library
of congress and the copyright
office that suggests that the

00:33:15.060-->00:33:20.031
DMCA horrifically overreaches
and they've made it really easy
for people like you to ask for

00:33:20.031-->00:33:25.437
exceptions to the DMCA to let
you do your work. Uh if you look
at EFF's website, you can find

00:33:25.437-->00:33:29.774
more information on that. Now,
this is the time in the talk
where have given you the lay of

00:33:29.774-->00:33:33.511
the land I'm supposed to tell
you something very anodyne and
generic about what we should do

00:33:33.511-->00:33:38.049
next, like you should donate to
EFF, which you should do, you
should tell your friends, which

00:33:38.049-->00:33:42.654
you should do, you should write
good code, which you should do,
and that's all good advice but,

00:33:42.654-->00:33:48.026
this time I have a specific
actionable thing that you can do
when you get back to work on

00:33:48.026-->00:33:53.164
Monday, that will make a huge
difference. So there's an
organization that you've all

00:33:53.164-->00:33:57.369
heard of and that you probably
feel good about like I do, I
think they're an amazing

00:33:57.369-->00:34:02.073
organization called the world
wide web consortium. The
leading, uh proponent of open

00:34:02.073-->00:34:08.113
standards on the web, the W3C,
they're where uh most of the
code that we write for the web

00:34:08.113-->00:34:14.853
uh is standardized. And since
2013, the W3C has pursued a-a
course that I think was really

00:34:14.853-->00:34:20.458
unwise and whose wiseness
becomes more clear with
everyday. They decided to allow

00:34:20.458-->00:34:25.864
themselves to be used to make a
DRM standard for web video. That
means that the entertainment

00:34:25.864-->00:34:30.769
companies and DRM vendors who
joined the W3C could work with
the browser vendors to form a

00:34:30.769-->00:34:37.275
patent pool that lets them make
DRM for all browsers that works
relatively seamlessly so that uh

00:34:37.275-->00:34:41.713
there isn't as much market
pushback against it without
facing any of the uh thorny

00:34:41.713-->00:34:45.417
antitrust scrutiny that they
would get if they were just to
go do that in a smoke filled

00:34:45.417-->00:34:51.957
room. Now EFF we joined and we
tried and failed to convince
them not to make DRM. So we

00:34:51.957-->00:34:57.462
offered a huge compromise, I
think the biggest compromise in
EFF's uh activist history. We

00:34:57.462-->00:35:03.268
said go ahead if you must and
make DRM, but don't let your
members use the W3C process to

00:35:03.268-->00:35:09.975
seize control over the future of
the web, we said take your
existing W3C IPR agreement

00:35:09.975-->00:35:14.346
that's the one that says that
members can't use their patents
to attack people who implement

00:35:14.346-->00:35:19.484
W3C standards and do legitimate
things with them and expand it
so that members also can't use

00:35:19.484-->00:35:24.489
the rights they get under DRM
law to attack people doing
legitimate things. Thank you

00:35:27.158-->00:35:32.163
[applause] So, this compromise,
it doesn't stop W3C members from
suing anyone who commits a

00:35:36.034-->00:35:40.538
copyright infringement, primary,
secondary, it doesn't stop them
from suing people who infringe

00:35:40.538-->00:35:44.442
their patents or their
trademarks or people who steal
their trade secrets or people

00:35:44.442-->00:35:50.849
who commit tortious interference
with their agreements with their
users. All it says is that W3C

00:35:50.849-->00:35:56.054
members can't use DRM as an
excuse to threaten and silence
security researchers. They can't

00:35:56.054-->00:35:59.991
use DRM to attack people who
work to make video more
accessible to people with

00:35:59.991-->00:36:04.496
disabilities. They can't use DRM
to decide who can enter the
market and with which products

00:36:04.496-->00:36:10.301
and services, they can't use DRM
to stop legitimate activities
like archiving videos. And

00:36:10.301-->00:36:15.373
dozens of members supported this
compromise in a vote last March.
The royal national institute for

00:36:15.373-->00:36:20.712
blind people, stone- us uh uh
Stony Brook University, the
German national library,

00:36:20.712-->00:36:25.884
cryptocurrency and blockchain
companies, security research
firms like Dan Kaminsky's uh

00:36:25.884-->00:36:30.321
white opps, outside
organizations like Unesco, the
internet archive and the

00:36:30.321-->00:36:34.692
international federation of
library associations all came
out to support this proposal.

00:36:34.692-->00:36:38.163
Hundreds of human rights groups
from around the world,
especially the global south

00:36:38.163-->00:36:43.168
supported it, and then this
month, the W3C overruled every
single one of those objections.

00:36:45.203-->00:36:51.609
So we filed the first ever
appeal in W3C history, and we
need your help with it. Your

00:36:51.609-->00:36:57.615
employer, they dropped a couple
grand to send you here to nerd
summer camp, and put you up in a

00:36:57.615-->00:37:03.321
hotel and it's not because
they're big hearted slobs, it's
because they need you! Security

00:37:03.321-->00:37:08.760
experts are a non fungible
highly scarce resource that is
essential to the successful

00:37:08.760-->00:37:14.132
operation of every enterprise.
In a world with millions of
people looking for jobs, you are

00:37:14.132-->00:37:19.571
the people who have jobs looking
for you! That's why your email
inbox and your Linkedin profile

00:37:19.571-->00:37:25.844
are filled with spammy requests
from recruiters, and that gives
you power that you can flex and

00:37:25.844-->00:37:30.215
you need to flex it because you
are under attack, the digital
millennium copyright act, the

00:37:30.215-->00:37:35.019
computer fraud and abuse act and
other laws have become the rug
that the inconvenient truths

00:37:35.019-->00:37:40.492
that the security research
community are swept under. In a
world in which security is an

00:37:40.492-->00:37:45.196
afterthought, and billions are
at risk, your ability to speak
the truth about the dumb

00:37:45.196-->00:37:51.903
mistakes that companies make is
under sustained relentless
assault. We can't afford a

00:37:51.903-->00:37:57.542
future in which billions of
people use a browser with
standardized DRM in it that no

00:37:57.542-->00:38:02.380
one is allowed to investigate
and report on. So, if you work
for google, remember that your

00:38:02.380-->00:38:07.886
company made its profits by
integrating units like blogger
and youtube and search whose

00:38:07.886-->00:38:14.125
only rule was only reference
copyrighted uh only reference
copyrighted works in accordance

00:38:14.125-->00:38:19.464
with the law and not only use
copyrighted works in ways that
no one objects to. You got to do

00:38:19.464-->00:38:24.936
what was legal, not what didn't
rock the boat. Go and find your
chrome security team and tell

00:38:24.936-->00:38:29.474
them the ability of independent
researchers to report on
mistakes that put the whole web

00:38:29.474-->00:38:35.079
at risk is under assault remind
them that lifeline, your
implementation of this DRM, it

00:38:35.079-->00:38:40.251
was broken for 6 years before
anyone had the guts to point it
out. That person worked at a

00:38:40.251-->00:38:46.024
university in Israel, the only
country that doesn't have a law
banning disclosures about DRM.

00:38:46.024-->00:38:50.495
If you work for Mozilla,
remember that there would be no
Mozilla if rights holders had be

00:38:50.495-->00:38:55.700
en successful in their bid to
stop mods from shipping a pop up
blocker that was on by default.

00:38:55.700-->00:39:01.806
Mozilla only exists because the
rule is don't break the law, not
don't rock the boat. Go and find

00:39:01.806-->00:39:07.145
your security team on Monday and
remind them that they're working
at a substantial discount of the

00:39:07.145-->00:39:12.217
market rate of their wage bec-
at a non profit because they
believe in the open web, and

00:39:12.217-->00:39:17.722
Mozilla can save the open web by
voting of the W3C for a rule
that says that rights holders

00:39:17.722-->00:39:23.161
can't threaten security
researchers. If you work for
apple, remember that rip mix

00:39:23.161-->00:39:29.334
burn is the origin story of the
iphone and that apple as we know
it today depends on the ability

00:39:29.334-->00:39:35.873
to do what's legal and not what
doesn't piss off rights holders.
Go and find your safari security

00:39:35.873-->00:39:41.145
team, and remind them that
spyware companies have used fake
updates for apple products to

00:39:41.145-->00:39:46.184
target disadence on behalf of
torturing regimes and that we
need to be able to disclose

00:39:46.184-->00:39:50.555
security defects in our products
so we can catch that kind of
shenanigans. Remind them that

00:39:50.555-->00:39:54.692
apple, just like everybody else
makes mistakes and that
securities a process and not a

00:39:54.692-->00:39:59.764
product and the process requires
that anyone be allowed to tell
the truth about defects in

00:39:59.764-->00:40:04.702
apple's products. No matter
which browser vendor you work
for, Microsoft or by due,

00:40:04.702-->00:40:09.407
remember that you will probably
work for someone else
eventually, and your ability to

00:40:09.407-->00:40:14.045
come up with amazing products
that build on the stuff you did
in your last job requires that

00:40:14.045-->00:40:18.950
you be allowed to do what's
legal, not what your old boss
would approve of. You are

00:40:18.950-->00:40:23.221
security researchers, you are
the elite and your employers
need you. They sent you to

00:40:23.221-->00:40:27.926
DEFCON as a little bonus, like a
parent sending a beloved child
to summer camp, and I want you

00:40:27.926-->00:40:32.797
to go home from camp with a
homemade ear piercing, a
comprehensive vocabulary with

00:40:32.797-->00:40:37.335
shocking swear words and a word
perfect knowledge of every song
the Ramones ever wrote

00:40:41.005-->00:40:46.010
[laughter] [applause]. I don't
care how badly entertainment
companies want DRM to be a

00:40:48.112-->00:40:54.519
thing, it's still bullsh**t that
doesn't make it harmless. DRM
for web video will mean that for

00:40:54.519-->00:40:58.623
example, no one can write code
to scan ahead looking for
strobes that could trigger

00:40:58.623-->00:41:03.194
seizures from people with
photosensitive epilepsy, and
that is not a theoretical risk.

00:41:03.194-->00:41:06.631
I wish I did have my slides,
because I have a picture of my
friend Jennifer, she works at my

00:41:06.631-->00:41:10.802
local mailbox, its where I go
and pick up my mail everyday and
spontaneously she started

00:41:10.802-->00:41:15.073
telling me about how she has
photosensitive epilepsy, how she
has 3 kids, how she likes to

00:41:15.073-->00:41:20.745
unwind with Netflix and how 2
years ago the worst seizure of
her life 5 gran mal consecutive

00:41:20.745-->00:41:25.116
seizures that landed her in
hospital were triggered by
watching a netflix video with a

00:41:25.116-->00:41:30.421
strobe effect in it. There are
not enough human video watching
hours remaining in our species

00:41:30.421-->00:41:35.126
to watch every video online and
subtitle it add assisted tracks
to it shift it's gamma for

00:41:35.126-->00:41:39.597
people with color blindness and
find intact the strobe effects,
but we can make those things for

00:41:39.597-->00:41:44.435
video with code if we can run
the code. If it's not a felony
punishable by 5 year prison

00:41:44.435-->00:41:49.207
sentence and a 500, 000 dollar
fine, to break the code. If the
W3 steps up and tells the

00:41:49.207-->00:41:53.845
entertainment companies that the
quid pro quo for getting to use
the W3C to make DRM's, they have

00:41:53.845-->00:41:58.850
to promise not to abuse the
DMCA. So, your employers need
you uh the reason you get to uh

00:42:01.753-->00:42:06.424
one minute, the reason you get
to go to work with facial
piercings and blue hair and

00:42:06.424-->00:42:10.027
black t-shirts with vaguely
menacing slogans on them, and
the janitors don't, is not that

00:42:10.027-->00:42:14.098
you're more important than the
janitors, the janitors are doing
important security work, the

00:42:14.098-->00:42:19.137
reason that you're not dead of
listeria is that they do their
job. The reason you get to do

00:42:19.137-->00:42:23.641
what you do and the janitors
don't is that you have rare
skills that your employer

00:42:23.641-->00:42:30.047
depends on. You have market
power and with power comes
responsibility. Your job is to

00:42:30.047-->00:42:34.886
keep people safe, you signed up
to make computers safe for
people, not to help the cause of

00:42:34.886-->00:42:39.657
making people subservient to
computers. When your boss wants
you to make DRM they are asking

00:42:39.657-->00:42:44.462
you to do something that is both
delusional and dangerous. It is
a catastrophically bad idea to

00:42:44.462-->00:42:48.800
design computers that treat
their owners as their
adversaries, and thankfully,

00:42:48.800-->00:42:53.137
it's also a catastrophically
stupid idea, and that's why your
boss is on the wrong side of

00:42:53.137-->00:42:57.341
history. The future won't be
full of computers that are
almost or incomplete that run

00:42:57.341-->00:43:01.979
all the programs except for the
ones that your boss doesn't like
even though some quack convinced

00:43:01.979-->00:43:07.385
your boss that DRM is a thing,
it's not a thing. I didn't come
here today to make you feel

00:43:07.385-->00:43:11.556
sh**y about your job, but if you
feel s***y about your job right
now, think about what you can do

00:43:11.556-->00:43:15.526
about it. We won't win this
fight, cause it's not the kind
of fight that you win, it's the

00:43:15.526-->00:43:20.264
kind of fight you fight forever
and that's what EFF is going to
do, with your help. Thank you

00:43:20.264-->00:43:25.269
