00:00:00.083-->00:00:06.875
>>Two years ago I was sitting in
the Paris hotel, the Thursday
morning that Def Con was to

00:00:06.875-->00:00:11.875
start and my phone rang. And I
was a little nervous to answer
it because I kinda knew what the

00:00:13.958-->00:00:18.958
phone call was about. And it was
my doctor calling me back to
tell me that the biopsy that I

00:00:22.000-->00:00:27.958
had had on a lump in my breast
the day before I left for Def
Con had come back positive and I

00:00:27.958-->00:00:32.958
had breast cancer. I share this
with you because it's what
actually ended up starting the

00:00:37.042-->00:00:43.708
research that I did that I'm
going to share with you today.
For those of who have never been

00:00:43.708-->00:00:48.750
through chemo or don't know
anyone who's gone through it, I
think most people know that, you

00:00:48.750-->00:00:52.375
know the, you know - the losing
your hair; the throwing up.
That's uh, pretty much everyone

00:00:52.375-->00:00:57.208
knows about that but there's a
lot of other side effects that
come with chemotherapy. And one

00:00:57.208-->00:01:02.208
of them is called 'chemo brain'
and the regiment that I was on
was, uh, ACT which is adriamycin

00:01:07.292-->00:01:13.417
cytoxan and taxol and another
name for adriamycin is
doxorubicin hydrochloride and

00:01:13.417-->00:01:20.083
that's the one that essentially,
pretty much, kind of tries to
destroy the mitochondria in your

00:01:20.083-->00:01:26.708
brain - it affects their energy
levels. And it results in
forgetfulness; memory lapses;

00:01:26.708-->00:01:32.792
difficulty concentrating or
focusing on tasks; trouble with
recall - remembering words or

00:01:32.792-->00:01:38.042
names. Uh, my team can testify
to the fact that there have been
many of a time in a conference

00:01:38.042-->00:01:44.875
where I've been like trying to
put a sentence together and can
not recall normal everyday words

00:01:44.875-->00:01:49.208
that most people know. I, I
can't pull them out of my head.
I'm better; I'm getting better

00:01:49.208-->00:01:54.500
at it but it still happens. Uhm,
and then also struggling to do
more than one task at a time.

00:01:54.500-->00:01:59.500
Uhm, as a hacker our mind is our
like most valuable tool so,
losing my hair; my eyebrows; my

00:02:06.500-->00:02:13.500
eyelashes - even losing both
breasts was not as traumatic or
devastating to me as starting to

00:02:13.500-->00:02:18.500
lose my mind. So, when the chemo
ended, uh, I was kind of hoping
that it would just all go back

00:02:21.250-->00:02:26.250
to normal and it, and it didn't.
So, I started to try to research
how to heal my brain and in the

00:02:28.625-->00:02:33.958
process of that I stumbled upon
some research that was being
done at Stanford and I believe

00:02:33.958-->00:02:38.500
it was SRI International, they
were partnered. And they were
talking a lot about using the

00:02:38.500-->00:02:43.167
mind for authentication and I
kept like, like kind of putting
that to the side - like I really

00:02:43.167-->00:02:48.167
wanna look at that but let's get
this fixed first. Once I felt a
little better about my own

00:02:48.167-->00:02:52.625
cognitive faculties I went back
and started looking at this
research because I was very

00:02:52.625-->00:02:58.417
fascinated by this concept and I
wanted to know how far along
they were with it. How does it

00:02:58.417-->00:03:04.000
actually work? I mean, like,
really - how do you implant a
password? How do you do this?

00:03:04.000-->00:03:10.083
So, today I'm gonna share kind
of what I taught myself and what
I've learned and kind of some of

00:03:10.083-->00:03:15.083
the, like, hackability of it or,
kind of, uh, the where they're
at with it as far as actually

00:03:17.375-->00:03:22.375
being a viable option. Uhm, but
next slide. So, a little about
myself before I start: I'm a

00:03:25.792-->00:03:31.500
security engineer and researcher
with Digital Cloak and my
undergrad is in Sociology -

00:03:31.500-->00:03:37.458
which is a psychology of group
behavior as opposed to the
individual. Uh, my minor was

00:03:37.458-->00:03:43.375
deviancy which has served me
well in this environment.
[laughter] My grad work and

00:03:43.375-->00:03:48.125
degrees are in security
management and cyber security.
So, I kind came into the

00:03:48.125-->00:03:54.417
security arena from the cyber a,
area kind of late but it can be
done. Uhm, and the agenda for

00:03:54.417-->00:03:59.250
this talk is gonna kind of cover
some conceptual groundwork. So,
you can kinda understand some of

00:03:59.250-->00:04:04.250
the research when I, when I
share it. I still can't feel the
ends of my fingers either.

00:04:06.250-->00:04:13.000
[chuckle] It's neuropathy. Uhm,
so last time I spoke at Def Con
I was actually fortunate enough

00:04:13.000-->00:04:19.042
to have one of the researchers I
cited that attended my talk - so
if any of the researchers I

00:04:19.042-->00:04:24.542
mentioned in my talk actually
happen to be sitting here, like,
jump up and wave your arms! So

00:04:24.542-->00:04:29.083
we can say high and maybe have
you come up and maybe, and, and
tell us about your research

00:04:29.083-->00:04:34.083
better than I can maybe. Uh,
next slide So, cognitive memory,
this is, cognition is the mental

00:04:37.583-->00:04:42.500
action or process of acquiring
knowledge and understanding
through thought; experience; or

00:04:42.500-->00:04:48.333
your senses Or some combination
of them. It's knowledge,
attention, memory, judgement,

00:04:48.333-->00:04:54.958
evaluation, reasoning, problem
solving - all of that. And it
can be conscious or sub- slash

00:04:54.958-->00:04:59.958
unconscious. It can be in Excuse
me. It can be intuitive which is
the ability to acquire knowledge

00:05:04.917-->00:05:09.875
without understanding - so, if
you think of like instinct. Or
it can be conceptual, so based

00:05:09.875-->00:05:14.875
on ideas or concepts. Like if
you're in a classroom learning
something. Consciousness can be

00:05:17.625-->00:05:22.083
defined from two different ways
- biologically or
philosophically. So, your

00:05:22.083-->00:05:27.417
consciousness from a biological
perspective refers to the idea
of being like awake and aware of

00:05:27.417-->00:05:32.875
your surroundings and
experiences and the people and
things in your environment. And

00:05:32.875-->00:05:38.833
philosophically it can refer
more to having a soul or a sense
of self. We're, uhm, going to be

00:05:38.833-->00:05:43.833
focusing on the biologic
consciousness here.
Unconsciousness is when your

00:05:45.875-->00:05:50.667
ability to maintain an awareness
of your environment or
surrounding like stimulus is

00:05:50.667-->00:05:55.500
lost. And there's either a
complete or near-complete lack
of responsiveness to your

00:05:55.500-->00:06:01.292
environment or stimulus. Uhm,
there's a medical concept of
being unconscious and a legal

00:06:01.292-->00:06:06.292
concept of being unconscious.
So, medically you can be
unconscious, uhm, kind of, like

00:06:10.042-->00:06:15.042
from, uh, like, like a brain
injury or perhaps like a drug
induced unconsciousness that

00:06:17.042-->00:06:22.792
they'll do sometimes. Uhm, but
legally you can also be
unconscious maybe if you're

00:06:22.792-->00:06:27.792
impaired from drugs or hypnosis
or has anyone in here been like
so tired that they just 'can't

00:06:31.375-->00:06:36.750
even' anymore? It's you, you're,
you're awake and you're standing
up and you're like able to

00:06:36.750-->00:06:41.750
function but your mind just,
you're just done, right? So that
can kind of go into the area or

00:06:41.750-->00:06:47.667
like 'legally unconscious' in a
way. But I'm not a lawyer so
don't try to use that in court.

00:06:47.667-->00:06:52.667
[chuckle] Next slide So, Sigmund
Freud in, uh, 1893 was the first
to use the term, uh, 'sub

00:06:55.917-->00:06:59.583
conscious'. And what I thought
was interesting was when I was
trying to figure out like where

00:06:59.583-->00:07:03.708
they really drew a line between
sub conscious and unconscious -
it turns out that Sigmund Freud

00:07:03.708-->00:07:07.708
actually used the terms
interchangeably. Because in his
native German it was kind of

00:07:07.708-->00:07:14.292
almost the same word. And now
the argument seems to be more of
a, kind of a semantic,

00:07:14.292-->00:07:19.750
grammatical thing than a
definitive thing. Uhm, in
general unconsciousness

00:07:19.750-->00:07:23.792
typically tends to refer to a
state of awareness from a
medical perspective. And

00:07:23.792-->00:07:28.208
subconscious tends to refer to
an aspect of your psyche when
discussing more of like a

00:07:28.208-->00:07:34.500
psycho-analytical environment.
Uhm, but if there's any shrinks
in the audience who wanna argue

00:07:34.500-->00:07:40.667
about, we can do that later.
[laughter] Uh, the best I can
tell is, uhm, it's more of a

00:07:40.667-->00:07:45.667
grammatical issue than a
definite one, uhm, but I am
gonna differentiate in them in

00:07:48.583-->00:07:53.875
this talk. Next slide Okay So,
for now just think of
subconscious as a part of your

00:07:53.875-->00:07:58.375
consciousness that is not
currently in your focal
awareness. And there was a

00:07:58.375-->00:08:02.042
psychologist named Edwin Locke
who put it really well, I think.
He called it 'the alternative

00:08:02.042-->00:08:06.458
storehouse of knowledge and
prior experience'. And there's
two main types of long-term

00:08:06.458-->00:08:11.458
human memory - we have explicit
and implicit memory. [audience
noise] Oh, that's my.. you can

00:08:14.833-->00:08:20.167
go back. That was my obligatory
cat slide for Def Con.
[laughter] Uhm, explicit memory

00:08:20.167-->00:08:27.167
is also known as 'declarative'
memory. Uh, it's conscious and
there's two kinds - epis,

00:08:27.167-->00:08:32.167
episodic and semantic. So,
episodic is more storing a
personal experience like a kiss

00:08:36.333-->00:08:40.792
that really meant a lot to you
or that you remember distinctly.
And then semantic would be more

00:08:40.792-->00:08:45.792
like data about the kiss or a
kiss. Implicit memory, uhm, does
anyone here ride bike, or ? You

00:08:53.292-->00:08:58.917
ride a bike? SO that's kind of a
good example, uh, I do
triathlons and we train

00:08:58.917-->00:09:04.417
constantly to get things into
our implicit memory so that when
you're in the middle of a race

00:09:04.417-->00:09:10.875
it, uh, it's just your instinct
it kind of takes over. Uhm, so,
uhm, it's basically acquired and

00:09:10.875-->00:09:15.792
used unconsciously and it can
affect your thoughts and
behaviors. And this is kind of

00:09:15.792-->00:09:21.708
where when we get to implanting
- this is where they're putting
the password. Uhm, one of the

00:09:21.708-->00:09:26.542
most common forms is procedural
which helps people performing
certain tasks without awareness

00:09:26.542-->00:09:31.542
of actually performing it. Uh,
people use explicit memory
through the day like remembering

00:09:31.542-->00:09:36.542
and appointment or recalling an
event from, you know, years ago.
Uhm, and implicit is more like

00:09:39.208-->00:09:44.167
an unintentional un, sub
conscious form. So, if you
remember a specific driving

00:09:44.167-->00:09:49.917
lesson you had - that's an
example of explicit memory but
if your driving skill improves

00:09:49.917-->00:09:56.542
as a result of that lesson -
that is more the implicit
memory. Okay, memory as tool

00:09:56.542-->00:10:03.042
versus memory as an object. Uhm,
there's, they put forth that you
can use it kind of both ways. So

00:10:03.042-->00:10:07.375
memory's treated as an object
when you're recalling or
recognizing like an actual

00:10:07.375-->00:10:13.250
memory. But then when you're
talking about using it to serve
as an authenticator this is more

00:10:13.250-->00:10:17.500
where you would use it as a
tool. And, so, why is this
important? Because they're

00:10:17.500-->00:10:24.250
looking at this research as
being considered potentially a
subclass of behavioral biometric

00:10:24.250-->00:10:29.500
measurement. So, this is where
we're gonna start to connect
with the idea of implanting

00:10:29.500-->00:10:35.833
passwords as an option - so,
we're gonna talk about encoding
storage and retrieval. So, with

00:10:35.833-->00:10:41.125
encoding, this is processing
information into the memory. And
there's several different ways

00:10:41.125-->00:10:46.208
of encoding information. There's
structural encoding - which is
how something looks. And an

00:10:46.208-->00:10:50.958
example would be if you had a
word - is it long? Is it short?
Is it all uppercase or

00:10:50.958-->00:10:56.583
lowercase? Is it handwritten? Is
it typed? Then mnemonic decoding
is how something sounds - so,

00:10:56.583-->00:11:00.708
like, how does a certain word
sound? So, then semantic
encoding focuses more on the

00:11:00.708-->00:11:06.083
meaning and it requires a deeper
level of processing than
structural or mnemonic, uhm, and

00:11:06.083-->00:11:12.042
it usually results in a better
memory because you're kind of
creating an association. Storage

00:11:12.042-->00:11:17.042
is after the information enters
your brain it has to be stored
or maintained or forgotten. So,

00:11:21.917-->00:11:26.667
there's a three stage model that
was proposed by Richard Atkinson
and Richard Shiffrin, it's often

00:11:26.667-->00:11:32.500
used to describe this process.
This is my attempt to make a, a
representation of it. So,

00:11:32.500-->00:11:38.500
essentially you have sensory
memory; short term memory and
long term memory. Sensory memory

00:11:38.500-->00:11:42.875
stores the incoming sensory
information in detail but only
for an instant - the capacity is

00:11:42.875-->00:11:48.917
very large but the information
in it is unprocessed. Visual
sensual memory is iconic memory

00:11:48.917-->00:11:54.917
and auditory sensory memory is
called echoic memory. SO, then
you get to short term memory and

00:11:54.917-->00:11:59.208
some of the information in
sensory memory can transfer into
short term memory and that can

00:11:59.208-->00:12:04.958
hold information for about 20
seconds. And rehearsing is a way
that you can kind of keep

00:12:04.958-->00:12:10.167
information in your short term
memory longer. So, an example is
like if someone, like if you're

00:12:10.167-->00:12:13.458
parking your car and you're
trying to remember like where
did you park your car and you're

00:12:13.458-->00:12:18.875
walking to like wherever and
you're like 'P2, P2, P2, P .'.
It's kind of like a way to keep

00:12:18.875-->00:12:21.792
to kind of keep it in your mind
and get it in there a little
better. Uh, short term memory

00:12:21.792-->00:12:27.083
has a limited capacity and it
can store about seven pieces of
information give or take and

00:12:27.083-->00:12:31.667
these pieces of information can
be small. Such as like
individual numbers or letters or

00:12:31.667-->00:12:36.583
larger like familiar numbers or
words. So, like, if you think
try and remember the word 'cat'

00:12:36.583-->00:12:42.208
- you're not gonna remember c,
a, t - you're gonna remember the
word 'cat'. And with the, the

00:12:42.208-->00:12:47.208
visual. [grunt] So, information
can be kept in your working
memory while you process or exam

00:12:50.042-->00:12:54.583
it and then once you're done
with it either is pretty much
forgotten or it moves into your

00:12:54.583-->00:13:00.917
long term memory. Uh, long term
memory has an almost infinite
capacity and the information

00:13:00.917-->00:13:05.833
usually stays there for the
duration of a person's life.
However the big issue is it's

00:13:05.833-->00:13:11.667
there but you're not always able
to retrieve it which is where
the chemo kind of affected me

00:13:11.667-->00:13:16.875
was the data was in there - I
was just not able to pull it out
and that's what I was struggling

00:13:16.875-->00:13:21.708
with. So, with retrieval, that's
the process of getting the
information out of your memory

00:13:21.708-->00:13:27.375
and they have these retrieval
cues and those are stimuli to
kind of help you remember. Uhm

00:13:27.375-->00:13:32.375
and they include associations;
context and mood. Next slide So,
context is, uhm, you can try to

00:13:36.458-->00:13:41.417
remember an event by putting
yourself in the same context you
were when it happened. Such as

00:13:41.417-->00:13:47.750
if someone lost a paddle from
last night and they're trying to
remember where it is [laughter]

00:13:47.750-->00:13:52.792
Sorry, that was for my boss Uhm,
they could kind of go back to
where they remember they had it

00:13:52.792-->00:13:57.333
last and walk through If they
can remember where they went
next and see if they can find it

00:13:57.333-->00:14:01.083
along Or you can do they same
with your car keys if you've
ever lost them. Uhm,

00:14:01.083-->00:14:06.833
associations, this is our equal
opportunity, gratuitous, sexy
photos - I hope I hit most

00:14:06.833-->00:14:13.000
everyone in the audience. Uhm
[laughter] If, not, I'm so sorry
- I only had so many slides and

00:14:13.000-->00:14:18.042
so much time. Uhm, but the brain
stores information as networks
of associative concepts so

00:14:18.042-->00:14:24.375
recalling a particular word can
be easy if another related word
is recalled first. So, here's an

00:14:24.375-->00:14:29.208
example - if you, if I show you
guys Like, these sunbathers on
the beach, and then I ask you to

00:14:29.208-->00:14:34.333
spell the word 'bear' you may be
more likely to spell the word
'b, a, r, e' instead of

00:14:34.333-->00:14:39.250
'b,e,a,r'. Because the picture
kind of primed you and
associated you to that

00:14:39.250-->00:14:44.500
particular spelling. And then
there's mood, so, uhm, if you're
in the same mood you were during

00:14:44.500-->00:14:48.542
a particular event, you could
maybe have an easier time
recalling the event, like kind

00:14:48.542-->00:14:53.542
of a nostalgia type thing if you
think about it. Here's our other
cat - they told me I had to put

00:14:56.000-->00:15:01.000
so many cats in and so many sexy
photos so I tried to make sure I
got them all. Uhm Next slide.

00:15:03.333-->00:15:08.542
Okay, the human brain has about
a billion neurons in it and each
neuron forms about a thousand

00:15:08.542-->00:15:14.250
connections. And this was about
somewhere around a trillion
connections , I think. Uhm, the

00:15:14.250-->00:15:18.375
challenge is if each neuron
could only store a single
memory, running out of space

00:15:18.375-->00:15:23.083
would be a huge problem. So, you
might only have maybe a few
gigabytes of storage space, like

00:15:23.083-->00:15:27.958
about the same as an iPod or a
USB flash drive but because the
neurons combined so that each

00:15:27.958-->00:15:33.042
one helps with many memories at
a time, it exponentially
increases your brain's memory

00:15:33.042-->00:15:38.917
storage capacity to something
closer to about 2.5 petabytes
and the example, I think it was

00:15:38.917-->00:15:44.333
something like 300 million
hours, was it? Was it 300
million? 300 million hours of

00:15:44.333-->00:15:48.292
television shows is about the
capacity to store in there
because of the ways the neurons

00:15:48.292-->00:15:53.292
can connect. Time check. Doing
okay Alright, there are some
limitations to memory, uhm, I

00:15:58.958-->00:16:04.500
think everyone's seen that
gorilla basketball video? So,
that's like inattentional

00:16:04.500-->00:16:08.500
blindness or the illusion of
attention - you focus so much on
one thing you completely miss

00:16:08.500-->00:16:14.958
other stuff going on. [audience
noise] Sorry, there's false
memories, there's, uhm, the

00:16:14.958-->00:16:19.083
illusion of confidence which,
interestingly enough, apparently
that's the opposite of impostor

00:16:19.083-->00:16:25.375
syndrome. THey have one. Uhm,
the illusion of cause, there's a
tendency to make, uh, causal

00:16:25.375-->00:16:30.375
connections between related
facts that maybe are not
accurate. Uhm Next one. This is

00:16:34.083-->00:16:40.250
where I wanna get into the
research. Uh, one-word concept
vocabularies is called 'brain

00:16:40.250-->00:16:45.292
computer interface' so, the
initial motivation between
brain-computer interfaces was to

00:16:45.292-->00:16:50.125
develop communication devices
for the severely disabled.
Seeing as that I only have a

00:16:50.125-->00:16:54.458
limited time to speak, I won't
go into the deep dive about how
an individual can train their

00:16:54.458-->00:16:59.250
mu- and beta brainwaves to
control a cursor. And there's
some fascinating stuff around

00:16:59.250-->00:17:04.083
visual evoked potentials, uh,
but there's a plethora of
research if you're super

00:17:04.083-->00:17:09.125
interested in that level of
granularity. Uhm, but I did want
to point out - there is some

00:17:09.125-->00:17:14.125
research by doctor J.R. Wolpaw ,
uhm, and his research as a
starting and then doctor Niels

00:17:16.333-->00:17:21.667
Birbaumer with the thought
translation device - he's with
the university of Tubingen in

00:17:21.667-->00:17:27.250
Germany and he has created this
device that allows users to
compose phrases and sentences

00:17:27.250-->00:17:33.000
electronically just by thinking
them. So, he's neat. And you may
also want to look at a paper out

00:17:33.000-->00:17:38.500
of Dartmouth College about the
neurophone - it's a brain mobile
phone interface using wireless

00:17:38.500-->00:17:44.333
EEG headset and in their paper
his team shares the details of a
brain-controlled address book

00:17:44.333-->00:17:49.833
dialing app they created. So,
the point it, this is a super
huge area of research but I

00:17:49.833-->00:17:53.875
haven't heard a lot of it on
kind of our side of the house as
far as the security of these

00:17:53.875-->00:17:57.417
things. Uhm, but I did wanna
share the four key pieces of
research that I found to be the

00:17:57.417-->00:18:02.417
most interesting with the most
potential. Next slide Uhm, first
there's this Wait, go back Oh,

00:18:08.750-->00:18:15.750
yea, good. So, first, uhm, I'm
gonna murder this man's name,
so, I apologize ahead of time.

00:18:15.750-->00:18:20.708
But, Haristo Bohnhoff at
Stanford was working with some
cognitive scientists at

00:18:20.708-->00:18:25.583
Northwestern University and they
designed a game that looks
similar to guitar hero and this

00:18:25.583-->00:18:31.750
was called 'SISL' - Serial
Interception Sequence Learning.
And it's an authentication

00:18:31.750-->00:18:37.417
procedure That they created this
testing experiment around it.
Add they used mechanical turk

00:18:37.417-->00:18:42.417
through Amazon to do their
experiments. So, I'm not sure
how well that looks as far as

00:18:44.708-->00:18:49.708
like how you're able to look at
your subject pool from an
experimental prospective. I'm

00:18:52.417-->00:18:57.708
trying I'm like all up on it,
uhm, I do wanna walk you through
how it works but, uhm, I wanna

00:18:57.708-->00:19:02.375
make sure I get it right so I'm
gonna read it. The process of
learning the password involves

00:19:02.375-->00:19:06.958
the use of a specially crafted
computer game that resembles
guitar here - there are six

00:19:06.958-->00:19:13.750
buttons, 'S, D, F, J, K and L'
and the user has to hit the cor,
corresponding key or note when

00:19:13.750-->00:19:18.667
the circle reaches the bottom
threat. So, during a typical
training session of around 45

00:19:18.667-->00:19:24.042
minutes -, a user will make
about four thousand keystrokes.
And around 80, 80 percent of

00:19:24.042-->00:19:30.458
these keystrokes are being used
to subconsciously teach you a
thirty character password. Just

00:19:30.458-->00:19:35.458
leave it. Before running the
game creates a random sequence
of thirty letters chosen from

00:19:39.500-->00:19:45.042
the S, D, F, J, K, and L with no
repeating characters. This
equates to around 38 bits of

00:19:45.042-->00:19:50.458
entropy, uhm, and the 30
characters sequence is played
back to the user three times in

00:19:50.458-->00:19:56.250
a row and then padded out with
18 random characters for a total
of a 108 items. The sequence is

00:19:56.250-->00:20:00.958
repeated five times and then
there's a short pause and the
entire process is repeated six

00:20:00.958-->00:20:06.167
more times. And by this time the
experimental result suggests
that a thirty letter password is

00:20:06.167-->00:20:11.125
firmly i'm, implanted in your
sub conscious brain. The
authentication requires that you

00:20:11.125-->00:20:15.458
play a round of the game gut
this time you're 30 letter
sequence is interspersed with

00:20:15.458-->00:20:19.917
other random 30 letter
sequences. To pass the
authentication you have to

00:20:19.917-->00:20:25.375
reliable perform your sequence.
The research shows that even
after two weeks you're able to

00:20:25.375-->00:20:30.375
recall the sequence. The next
one is 'passthoughts' - so,
these, this is from Berkley,

00:20:32.500-->00:20:39.125
2013. This technique combines
three factors - something you
know, which is a thought;

00:20:39.125-->00:20:43.792
something you are, your brain
patterns; and then something you
have which is the EEG sensor for

00:20:43.792-->00:20:48.542
measuring the brainwaves. To
authenticate with a passthought,
you think your secret key while

00:20:48.542-->00:20:54.375
using the sensor. The key can be
just about anything - a song, a
phrase or a mental image and the

00:20:54.375-->00:20:57.958
thought itself is never
transmitted - just a
mathematical representation of

00:20:57.958-->00:21:02.958
the electrical signals your
brain makes while you think it.
Now, if someone else were to

00:21:05.583-->00:21:09.458
figure out what you were
thinking they still couldn't
impersonate your pass-thought in

00:21:09.458-->00:21:15.167
theory because every person
thinks the same thing
differently. So, you now, we

00:21:15.167-->00:21:19.500
could all think about the same
song but we're not all gonna
think about it exactly the same

00:21:19.500-->00:21:24.500
way as far as being registered
electronically. Time check.
Okay, so, this is how they did

00:21:26.667-->00:21:31.875
this one. The following tasks
were repeated five times in each
session for each subject. They

00:21:31.875-->00:21:36.000
had a breathing task, so, they
had to close their eyes and
focus on their breathing for 10

00:21:36.000-->00:21:41.292
seconds. They had to simulate
finger movements, so subjects
imagine in their mind that they

00:21:41.292-->00:21:45.583
are moving their right index
finger up and down insync with
their breathing without actually

00:21:45.583-->00:21:51.250
moving their finger. There was a
sports task where they selected
a repetitive motion from a sport

00:21:51.250-->00:21:55.875
of their choosing and they
imagined moving their body
muscles to the motion. Then

00:21:55.875-->00:22:02.125
there was a song passage
recitation task an eye-audio
tone task; an object counting

00:22:02.125-->00:22:07.208
task and then at the very end
they had a pass-thought which
they were asked to choose their

00:22:07.208-->00:22:13.375
own pass through like a password
but instead of choosing a
sequence or numbers they thought

00:22:13.375-->00:22:18.625
of a thought like a vision of
their wedding or their child
being born or the first time

00:22:18.625-->00:22:23.333
they got drunk or what have you.
And that, they had to think
about that for 10 seconds and

00:22:23.333-->00:22:28.333
then everything together became
their pass through. So, this was
some other interesting research

00:22:33.333-->00:22:37.833
that was done that kind of fed
into the next one. It was on the
feasibility of side channel

00:22:37.833-->00:22:44.250
attacks with brainwave computer
interface, uhm, I do have these
papers sited at the end of my

00:22:44.250-->00:22:49.125
slide deck, so, if you look them
up on the torrent they'll be
there. Uhm, but it studied the

00:22:49.125-->00:22:54.375
possibility of side channel
attacks using commercial EEG
types of headsets to reveal

00:22:54.375-->00:23:00.250
users' personal information like
their banks, ATMs or pin digits.
Their approach was similar to a

00:23:00.250-->00:23:05.333
guilty knowledge test where
items familiar to a user evoked
different responses as compared

00:23:05.333-->00:23:09.750
to items that were unfamiliar.
And so, for example, when a
person was shown images of many

00:23:09.750-->00:23:16.583
banks the brain response to the
image of their bank had more of
an interaction or, uhm, invoked

00:23:16.583-->00:23:22.083
a higher, like, potential with
the waves. The problem with
their attacks setup is was it

00:23:22.083-->00:23:27.083
intrusive and it could be easily
detected by the user but that
brought us to 'Peep'. So, Peep

00:23:29.375-->00:23:34.375
built upon their research and
what they try to do is create an
actual keylogger slash malware

00:23:37.375-->00:23:44.042
and this actually on, uhm, Fizz
dot org in June 29. Uhm, and
I'll read from the article, it's

00:23:44.042-->00:23:48.708
a quotes, 'Researchers at the
university of Alabama of
Birmingham suggests that the

00:23:48.708-->00:23:55.625
brainwave sensing headsets, also
known as EEG, need better
security after a study reveals

00:23:55.625-->00:24:01.375
hackers could guess a user's
passwords by monitoring their
brain waves'. So, in contrast to

00:24:01.375-->00:24:07.042
the research I mentioned on the
previous slide, the folks at the
university of Alabama wanted to

00:24:07.042-->00:24:12.583
test out a more surreptitious,
less-obtrusive approach that
only required passive monitoring

00:24:12.583-->00:24:18.375
of brain signals as users type
pins or passwords. And so they
called theirs 'Peat' which is

00:24:18.375-->00:24:24.625
Passively Eavesdropping Private
Input via brainwave signals. And
this was University of Alabama

00:24:24.625-->00:24:29.625
and I think one gentleman from
California, Riverside. Now, they
extensively reference the

00:24:31.750-->00:24:36.750
research of the previous group
with the side channel attacks.
And they named their keylogger

00:24:39.625-->00:24:45.250
'Peep' and so according to their
paper, as the use of these
devices, which they're referring

00:24:45.250-->00:24:50.000
to the EEG gaming and
entertainment devices headsets
for any of you who game. It

00:24:50.000-->00:24:54.708
becomes mainstream, a use may
enter passwords or private
credentials to the computers or

00:24:54.708-->00:24:59.500
their mobile phones while
they're wearing these devices.
And so, they were studying the

00:24:59.500-->00:25:05.917
potential of introducing a
malicious app to capture those
EEG signals and then process the

00:25:05.917-->00:25:10.917
signals to infer the sensitive
keystrokes. So, so, uh, the
gentlemen and his team used one

00:25:13.375-->00:25:18.167
regular store-bought EEG headset
that, like, anyone could buy at
Best Buy or what have you and

00:25:18.167-->00:25:22.583
then they also used a
clinical-grade headset in their
experiment and they were able to

00:25:22.583-->00:25:28.250
demonstrate how easy a malicious
software program could passively
eavesdrop on your brainwaves.

00:25:28.250-->00:25:33.250
So, while typing, uhm, your
inputs it could sense all of
this and, I think he was, so I

00:25:35.667-->00:25:39.917
quote from the article 'In a
real-world attack a hacker could
facilitate the training step

00:25:39.917-->00:25:44.875
required for the malicious
program to be the most accurate
by requesting that the use enter

00:25:44.875-->00:25:49.875
a predefined set of numbers in
order to restart the game after
pausing it to take a break.

00:25:49.875-->00:25:55.375
Similar to where a captcha is
used to verify certain users
logging in. The research show

00:25:55.375-->00:26:01.417
that after a user entered 200
characters algorithms within the
malicious software program could

00:26:01.417-->00:26:06.000
make educated guesses about new
characters the user entered by
monitoring the EEG data

00:26:06.000-->00:26:11.208
recorded. The algorithm they
created was able to shorten the
odds of a hacker guessing a four

00:26:11.208-->00:26:18.167
digit numerical pin from one in
10 thousand to one in 20. And,
increase the chance of guessing

00:26:18.167-->00:26:23.167
a six letter password from about
one in 500 thousand to roughly 1
in 500. So Security posture

00:26:33.583-->00:26:39.458
versus a rubber hose type of
cryptanalysis - the challenge in
testing their hypothesis is that

00:26:39.458-->00:26:44.333
as far as I know, especially at
Stanford there are no studies
that actually allow you to beat

00:26:44.333-->00:26:50.500
people during an experiment.
[laughter] Uhm, so I think in a
way they were kind of sexifying

00:26:50.500-->00:26:55.667
their paper title, you know, no
shade [laughter] Uhm, but after
a long discussion with a

00:26:55.667-->00:27:00.500
psychologist friend my current
opinion with SISL which is the
guitar hero in passthought Is

00:27:00.500-->00:27:05.833
there seems to be some
dependence on the consistency of
the entry of the authentication

00:27:05.833-->00:27:11.292
and by introducing an actual
rubber hose type attack or some
other similarly dramatic level

00:27:11.292-->00:27:17.625
of extraction, this could affect
the brainwaves themselves so the
ability to perform the action or

00:27:17.625-->00:27:23.750
the entry in a manner consistent
with the password was set up, it
could affect that thus rendering

00:27:23.750-->00:27:27.333
it, you know, even if you have
it, it's not gonna work because
it's not matching the

00:27:27.333-->00:27:31.958
brainwaves. Cause if you're
relaxed when you're going
through the implantation but

00:27:31.958-->00:27:36.417
you're being beaten with a
rubber hose, even if they get
the string, it's gonna be

00:27:36.417-->00:27:41.417
different. Uhm, so, so starting
with the, the SISL or the guitar
hero, they were able to test

00:27:43.542-->00:27:48.542
retrieval but not under stress
or trauma and they were able to
test basic cohersion, uhm,

00:27:52.292-->00:27:57.750
trying to, like, fool the system
and that went pretty well. The
potential attacks against that

00:27:57.750-->00:28:02.167
one involve the use of remote
authentication approach. Whether
or not the attacker is allowed

00:28:02.167-->00:28:06.958
multiple extraction attempt, if
there's performance gaps,
eavesdropping, none of this

00:28:06.958-->00:28:13.667
stuff's been tested. Just the
retrievals been tested. Uhm,
with passthoughts a hacker might

00:28:13.667-->00:28:17.292
be able to to beat the system by
using a phishing scheme that
would trick you into thinking

00:28:17.292-->00:28:23.458
your passthought capturing the
output maybe later, playing it
back. Uhm, and it was pointed

00:28:23.458-->00:28:28.417
out by the Peep research team
that the approach being used by
them and the side-channel

00:28:28.417-->00:28:33.417
attacks, uhm My brain just went
down. Uh The, the stuff is
generated to, for implantation

00:28:39.708-->00:28:45.500
with a random generator, so, you
could probably just go after it
from the source by going after

00:28:45.500-->00:28:51.000
the random generator that, that
issues it versus the actual
person who has it, if that makes

00:28:51.000-->00:28:56.000
sense. As to SISL and
passthoughts, there's in a
mostly theoretical state as far

00:29:01.125-->00:29:07.250
as research and experimentation
goes. I didn't really see anyone
addressing how memory can be

00:29:07.250-->00:29:12.625
affected by such things as drug
use or injury or even
degradation such as if you have

00:29:12.625-->00:29:17.375
an employee that's going through
chemo and suddenly their brain
is affected would they even be

00:29:17.375-->00:29:22.375
able to use, use any of this?
Would that, uhm, affect the
authentication pattern? Uhm, so,

00:29:24.500-->00:29:29.417
if, I don't really see this
being viable for use at large
right now until some of that

00:29:29.417-->00:29:34.417
questions are answered and, uhm,
one, uhm, you know, we're all
here at Def Con, so what happens

00:29:36.458-->00:29:42.542
if you have the password
implanted while you're sober at
work but then you've had a

00:29:42.542-->00:29:45.875
couple of drinks and then you
need to finish you proposal -
are you gonna be able to

00:29:45.875-->00:29:51.417
authenticate? Or while being
drunk or kinda drunk or even
just slightly impaired affect

00:29:51.417-->00:29:57.000
that ability? And that was
another thing I didn't' see,
uhm, addressed. uhm, cost was

00:29:57.000-->00:30:01.208
another big thing - it's all
well and good to propose this
but what's the exact cost

00:30:01.208-->00:30:05.708
associated with implementing
something like this? And, like,
would it be realistic it to

00:30:05.708-->00:30:10.708
deploy? With SISL the training
or encoding time was noted to be
45 minutes and with passthoughts

00:30:13.542-->00:30:19.417
it was two 40- to 50 minutes
sessions. And, so, if you have a
small organisation - five, 10

00:30:19.417-->00:30:24.125
people, that might be okay but
unlike trying to picture Locke
and Martin or something trying

00:30:24.125-->00:30:29.125
to do this with thousands of
people trying to put each one of
them through that. Uhm, with

00:30:31.167-->00:30:36.000
SISL there are certain people
this probably would work best
with but factors such as mental

00:30:36.000-->00:30:42.333
capacity or psychological
issues, uh, my sister in law
works with special needs adults

00:30:42.333-->00:30:46.708
who do stuff at the airport and
have to got through security
check points. So, especially

00:30:46.708-->00:30:51.542
with like the guitar hero type
of thing - would there be
certain people who just wouldn't

00:30:51.542-->00:30:56.208
be able to authenticate this
way? Just legitimately, they
just from a handicap perspective

00:30:56.208-->00:31:01.208
they can't do it. You know, even
some of our wounded warriors
like who don't have hands to do

00:31:03.875-->00:31:10.000
this kind of intricate type of
authentication and then things
like Parkinson's seizures - what

00:31:10.000-->00:31:14.625
if the individual's blind and
can't even see? I mean, I, I
didn't really see any of this

00:31:14.625-->00:31:20.708
addressed as far as like , using
it in the real world on a large
scale. Uhm, all in all I think

00:31:20.708-->00:31:26.292
it's fascinating with potential
but the research is still in a
pretty early stage. Uhm, the

00:31:26.292-->00:31:31.625
sample groups also, if anyone
here [audience noise] Grad
school, scientific research test

00:31:31.625-->00:31:36.625
groups to the SISL size
experiment number one was done
with 35 participants. Number two

00:31:40.167-->00:31:46.083
had two groups - 32 and 80
participants for a total of a
147 but they didn't clarify if

00:31:46.083-->00:31:50.583
any of were duplicates from the
first to second experiments - so
it actually might have been a

00:31:50.583-->00:31:57.375
smaller, a smaller group number.
Uhm, based on my own experience,
'm not sure a 147 represents a

00:31:57.375-->00:32:02.458
solid sample other than whether
it warrants further study - I do
think it warrants further

00:32:02.458-->00:32:07.917
studies but so far it's very
theoretical the passthoughts
material I read was based on

00:32:07.917-->00:32:12.917
research on a group of a total
of 15 subjects. The side channel
attack research had 28 subjects

00:32:16.083-->00:32:21.083
and the Peep research had a
whopping 12 subjects. So, again,
this is still really kind of in

00:32:23.625-->00:32:28.625
a very theoretical stage and a
pool of 12 subjects to me is not
a huge sample size from a

00:32:31.833-->00:32:37.917
research perspective except for
maybe to, to do further
research. Uhm, my thoughts

00:32:37.917-->00:32:42.917
around hackability - SISL refers
to the rubber hose - I just
really don't see that, I don't,

00:32:45.167-->00:32:49.917
I don't see how they're really,
like addressed it, i just think
they used the word cause it

00:32:49.917-->00:32:55.083
sounded kinda cool. Uhm, the
theory that, that the knowledge
is not consciously accessible to

00:32:55.083-->00:33:00.917
the individual - I'm still not
sure on that. Uhm, I have a
psychologist friend and he's in

00:33:00.917-->00:33:05.917
agreement with me, like, if you
can put it in, you can take it
out. Uhm, and there's to do

00:33:08.333-->00:33:14.042
that. Uh, for SISL, a good
potential attack factor might be
the, the, again, like I said -

00:33:14.042-->00:33:18.917
the random number generator or
the random password generator.
And in their paper, the pass

00:33:18.917-->00:33:23.875
through team pointed out they
were not vulnerable to shoulder
surfing because their system was

00:33:23.875-->00:33:27.500
invisible but they felt they
were very vulnerable to most
social engineering and

00:33:27.500-->00:33:32.125
dictionary attacks as their
system stood. However it was
their hope that with advances in

00:33:32.125-->00:33:36.250
signal recording and processing
technology it would allow for a
much more detailed capture of

00:33:36.250-->00:33:41.000
the thought itself And that
would protect better against
some of the dictionary attacks,.

00:33:41.000-->00:33:46.083
And they also felt they were
fairly vulnerable to phishing
attacks where if you could get

00:33:46.083-->00:33:50.333
someone to click on something
and record their thoughts while
they' were clicking they were

00:33:50.333-->00:33:55.875
kind of vulnerable from that
perspective. SISL's not designed
to prevent eavesdropping and

00:33:55.875-->00:34:01.708
shoulder surfing attacks, so, I
imagine a good video recording
of them performing the sequence

00:34:01.708-->00:34:07.792
could allow an attacker to
replicate it and considering how
many security video cameras are

00:34:07.792-->00:34:12.042
insecure, this is like
definitely a distinct
possibility and I believe they

00:34:12.042-->00:34:17.042
did say that in some of the
experiments the, the error ratio
was just enough that if someone

00:34:20.083-->00:34:25.083
knew that person's sequence
there were times they were able
to impersonate it. Uhm I talked

00:34:28.083-->00:34:32.542
to my sh, my psychologist
friend, uh, bout, uhm, using
hypnosis to potentially

00:34:32.542-->00:34:37.167
extracted it - that I did a
little bit more research into
and I'm not sure that's really a

00:34:37.167-->00:34:43.208
viable, like, vector but he and
I are actually still discussing
that at length, so, maybe I'll

00:34:43.208-->00:34:49.292
have more on that in the future.
Another thing, SISL's a flash
application. [laughter] So, I'll

00:34:49.292-->00:34:54.292
just put that right there
[laughter] Uhm, that was my
first big, like, 'Okay' Uhm, and

00:34:57.708-->00:35:03.333
SISL authentication proj, uh,
process is potentially
vulnerable to attack, uhm, if

00:35:03.333-->00:35:08.333
even an untrained person is able
to, like, mimic or degrade their
performance of the person

00:35:12.250-->00:35:17.250
they've watched authenticate.
Uhm, and then the authentication
based on keystroke dynamics is

00:35:19.708-->00:35:24.708
similar to authentication based
on tough, passthoughts, uhm, so
it looks a their typing rhythm

00:35:27.625-->00:35:34.458
and at what they're thinking at
the same time. With the, uh, so
I dunno, I think they just, they

00:35:34.458-->00:35:38.750
just still need to do more
research. So, in closing, I
think much of this is still in

00:35:38.750-->00:35:42.625
the experimental stage and it's
going to be really interesting
to see if anything actually

00:35:42.625-->00:35:48.833
comes of it especially
considering trying to deploy it
across a, a large environment or

00:35:48.833-->00:35:53.833
organisation or a very varied
depopulation - like a bigger
sample size in total. Uhm, check

00:35:57.250-->00:36:02.250
for time. So Some of my research
I have the papers - there are
links to them but you don't have

00:36:04.750-->00:36:09.292
to click 'em. Uh, but you can
just google the name of the
paper and google scholar will

00:36:09.292-->00:36:14.292
come right up. And then the last
thing I wanted to leave you with
is, it was kind of interesting,

00:36:17.667-->00:36:22.500
about halfway through my
research someone mentioned to me
'Oh my God, have you read this?'

00:36:22.500-->00:36:28.917
It's a book called 'Hard Boiled
Wonderland and the end of the
world'. And it was written by

00:36:28.917-->00:36:33.917
Haruki Murakami and it's
actually from 1985 - '85. And
what, what I thought was very

00:36:36.792-->00:36:42.542
interesting was,it's, it's, and
I'm not gonna spoil it, if you
wanna read it, but it's a

00:36:42.542-->00:36:48.375
parallel narrative type setup.
One of the narrators is called a
'calcu tech' and it's a human

00:36:48.375-->00:36:54.292
data processor encryption system
who's been trained to use their
sub conscious as an encryption

00:36:54.292-->00:36:59.292
key and the other narrator is a
newcomer to a strange, isolated
town. And I'll leave it there so

00:37:01.833-->00:37:06.167
I don't spoil it. But if you
find this interesting I actually
thought it was pretty

00:37:06.167-->00:37:11.167
fascinating that back in 1985
even, like, fantasy authors were
thinking about the idea of using

00:37:13.500-->00:37:18.500
the mind to authenticate for
encryption. So, that's all I
have I can do questions now, if

00:37:21.583-->00:37:26.583
anyone has them? [applause]
[cheering]
