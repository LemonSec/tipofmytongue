00:00:00.000-->00:00:04.004
>>Uh, so speaking at Def Con is
kinda tough I'm gonna put this
here so it'll be easier for

00:00:04.004-->00:00:09.376
everyone. There's- there's
thousands of you, you all look
like a swarm of people, so.

00:00:09.376-->00:00:16.383
>>Louder! We can't hear you!
[inaudible] >>I'll just hold it,
can you hear me now? >>Yeah!

00:00:16.383-->00:00:22.022
>>We're all good? Alright. Um.
So you can see a quote here it's
from a science fiction book it's

00:00:22.022-->00:00:26.593
about when we get out into space
and we discovered that all the
species we're expecting to run

00:00:26.593-->00:00:32.533
into, we missed em. Not by
distance but by time, they're
all dead. Millions of years gone

00:00:32.533-->00:00:35.202
they- we we we finally found
them and they're millions of
years gone and we go down to

00:00:35.202-->00:00:38.972
their planets and we try and
figure out who they were and we
discover that all the data from

00:00:38.972-->00:00:43.277
these advanced civilizations is
lost. We don't know what they
did because they stored all this

00:00:43.277-->00:00:48.048
stuff on things that evaporated
quickly, they were destroyed by
time, a term that we're going to

00:00:48.048-->00:00:53.921
get to called 'bit rot' and it's
important as we move further
into this digital age that we

00:00:53.921-->00:00:59.793
take time out of our lives to
find and protect the data that
needs to be protected. So a good

00:00:59.793-->00:01:05.499
bit of this talk is going to be
discussing the methodology and
the importance of what we- we as

00:01:05.499-->00:01:11.571
a group of hackers need to do to
protect some of this data and
some of our tools and certain

00:01:11.571-->00:01:18.011
aspects of our professional
skillsets are uniquely suited to
that. So without further adieu

00:01:18.011-->00:01:24.451
this is amateur digital
archeology and uh hacker is just
another word for amateur um if

00:01:24.451-->00:01:30.123
you wanna be professional you go
over to Black Hat ha- Def Con is
about the amateurs, it's about

00:01:30.123-->00:01:34.761
the new guys, the young guys,
the people who don't know any
better yet. That's what a hacker

00:01:34.761-->00:01:38.632
is. A hacker walks into
something and says I'm a
hobbyist I'm gonna figure this

00:01:38.632-->00:01:43.637
out. So you might be wondering
why any of this is important.
This is uh a subgenre of

00:01:45.739-->00:01:50.744
technology but if we're in Mosul
watching Isis get annihilated
and you have a reporter walking

00:01:53.046-->00:01:58.352
down the banks of River Tigris
and finds three dead bodies he
could either look at them take a

00:01:58.352-->00:02:02.255
photo write a blurb and keep
going or he could dig through
their pockets and if you dig

00:02:02.255-->00:02:06.927
through their pockets you might
find that they have a cell phone
on them and if they have a cell

00:02:06.927-->00:02:10.764
phone on them that cell phone
might have a memory card and if
there's a memory card there

00:02:10.764-->00:02:15.802
might be pictures and data. So
there was a great article done
by these two guys from BBC where

00:02:15.802-->00:02:19.806
one of the guys dug through some
pockets, found some photos, was
looking at the photos and

00:02:19.806-->00:02:22.943
realized the place he had been
staying in was the same place
they had been staying in, so he

00:02:22.943-->00:02:27.981
dug around and found a whole
bunch of data related to these
three guys, these three foot

00:02:27.981-->00:02:32.052
soldiers, he figured out that
they were an artillery squad,
that they had received certain

00:02:32.052-->00:02:36.289
orders, that they're- he
identified who they all were
then he start going back to the

00:02:36.289-->00:02:41.995
places they came from and built
a composite sketch on who these
guys were these random nobodies

00:02:41.995-->00:02:48.201
who worked for Isis. And this
gives us a unique insight into
who these people were at this

00:02:48.201-->00:02:52.973
momentous moment in time
something that we are talking
about right now, a hundred years

00:02:52.973-->00:02:55.976
from now people might not
understand, they might look at a
newspaper and go what the h**l

00:02:55.976-->00:03:00.914
is Isis, whose Mosul? Come on.
Um and this is- this is what we
call primary source information

00:03:03.016-->00:03:07.421
if you're familiar with uh
Howard Zinn who wrote A People's
History of the United States he

00:03:07.421-->00:03:11.391
wrote a history of the united
states focused on primary source
information the things that you

00:03:11.391-->00:03:15.562
find where people experienced
history, saw history, and they
provide a biased perspective but

00:03:15.562-->00:03:20.467
they provide a biased
perspective that's unmarred by
not knowing, not having been

00:03:20.467-->00:03:25.906
there. Um this is what the US
National Archive has to say
about primary sources and their

00:03:25.906-->00:03:30.043
importance in developing
critical thinking for chi-
children but it's also truly

00:03:30.043-->00:03:34.815
important for any historian to
build an idea of where their
version of history sits in

00:03:34.815-->00:03:40.220
relation to the people who lived
it. Um this is what our friend
Adam has to say at NYC Resistor

00:03:40.220-->00:03:45.492
on EEPROMs which are a primary
source information, he says
'find a board with a brain.' if

00:03:45.492-->00:03:50.330
you're a hacker any sort of chip
you see that has a brain, has
memory, is primary source

00:03:50.330-->00:03:56.103
information. SO this is kind of
the thrust of what we're gonna
be talking about. And in regards

00:03:56.103-->00:04:02.242
to amateur archeology it's uh
part of being an amateur is
recognizing your limitations,

00:04:02.242-->00:04:05.245
you're not a professional
archeologist or anthropologist
and you shouldn't think of

00:04:05.245-->00:04:10.984
yourself as one, you should- you
know- do what they expect you to
do but also recognize that you

00:04:10.984-->00:04:15.188
have limitations, you're not
gonna go up here and start
dropping a professional grade

00:04:15.188-->00:04:20.594
pureview paper what you can do
however is protect data for them
to write their paper. And the

00:04:20.594-->00:04:23.797
other great thing is because
you're dumb you can accomplish
things that other people didn't

00:04:23.797-->00:04:29.703
think were possible, like
flight. And uh I know some of
you guys here might be a little

00:04:29.703-->00:04:33.273
pissed off that Joe Random Idiot
managed to get their hands on
something that's probably of

00:04:33.273-->00:04:37.778
historical significance and
should probably be in a museum
uh it's important that you

00:04:37.778-->00:04:42.883
remember this is Def Con and we
are way more Lando Calrissian
than we are Professor Jones

00:04:42.883-->00:04:46.219
[laughter] most of the people
here are perfectly okay with
that, but for those of you who

00:04:46.219-->00:04:51.057
are still concerned, the
National Air and Space Museum
has several GRiD compasses and

00:04:51.057-->00:04:56.429
several GRiD cases, these are
the styles and machines that we
have um they also have one that

00:04:56.429-->00:05:02.869
was flown several times and they
have never released information
related to what data was on them

00:05:02.869-->00:05:06.873
they've only ever said 'here's
laptop, it's off, it's sitting
in a booth' it's like a dead

00:05:06.873-->00:05:13.280
machine, you don't have a full
composite idea of what they did
and why they did it. Um this is

00:05:13.280-->00:05:18.585
from recent news, this was
published maybe a couple weeks
ago. It hit our Ars Technica and

00:05:18.585-->00:05:23.023
the photo there is a photo of an
old tape system, these were the
data systems that did the

00:05:23.023-->00:05:28.995
analysis for pioneer 8 through I
believe 10 and that's the OIG
report number uh that URL that I

00:05:28.995-->00:05:33.867
referenced in the beginning and
will reference throughout has a
lot of this data available if

00:05:33.867-->00:05:39.506
you wanna dig through the actual
data I went through and it's sad
that the machines that analyze

00:05:39.506-->00:05:44.678
pioneer missions basically ended
up sitting outside of a
contracting office, in the

00:05:44.678-->00:05:49.349
elements, and an engineer
brought them home, put them in
his basement, and they got so

00:05:49.349-->00:05:54.054
destroyed by mold and the
elements that when OIG finally
found them and tried to see if

00:05:54.054-->00:05:58.091
there's any data they can pull
of them or any significance to
them they actually said it's

00:05:58.091-->00:06:03.430
safer to destroy them than it is
to try to analyze them because
of the mold. It was a toxic uh

00:06:03.430-->00:06:09.169
health hazard to the
investigators. Um it's important
that we protect a lot of this

00:06:09.169-->00:06:13.073
data because it's starting to go
away and I- this is a really
good project that has a direct

00:06:13.073-->00:06:18.545
tie to Def Con and to NYC
Resistor. Our friend Chris
Fenton wrote a P- FPGA

00:06:18.545-->00:06:22.482
Implementation of the Cray 1.
The Cray 1 if you've never heard
of the Cray Supercomputer

00:06:22.482-->00:06:25.852
Company you can ask someone else
here it's- it's a formative
moment in supercomputing

00:06:25.852-->00:06:31.157
history. The Cray 1 operating
system is gone as far as anyone
knows, if anyone here has access

00:06:31.157-->00:06:35.962
to an original Cray 1, talk to
me or enter it in the archive
later, the reality is is as far

00:06:35.962-->00:06:39.733
as anyone knows that operating
system is lost to history most
of the people who had Cray's

00:06:39.733-->00:06:44.371
burned their media when they
were done. Um he did find a guy
who is willing to give him a

00:06:44.371-->00:06:49.109
disc pack that he thought had
Cray 1 on it and brought it back
from Australia and he built an

00:06:49.109-->00:06:54.180
analog reader, read the analog
wave form, and I got an email
while I was at Def Con saying

00:06:54.180-->00:06:59.619
'hey I've got about 40 gigs of
analog wave form that I need to
analyze and find bits in' and it

00:06:59.619-->00:07:04.391
just so happened I was sitting
next to Jason Scott of Internet
Archive and handed him the phone

00:07:04.391-->00:07:09.029
and he immediately helped them
host it and within a couple days
they had two guys from Sweden

00:07:09.029-->00:07:14.467
and Norway who had written a-
analysis software to figure out
the bits and they start figuring

00:07:14.467-->00:07:18.505
out file systems and then they
were building it and writing it
in emulation and the next thing

00:07:18.505-->00:07:22.008
you know the Cray 1 XMP
Project's off and running to the
races you're able to kind of

00:07:22.008-->00:07:27.981
ressurect maybe not Cray 1 but a
Cray operating system that
otherwise would have been lost.

00:07:27.981-->00:07:30.817
And none of these people are
professionals or are getting
paid for this, this is what

00:07:30.817-->00:07:35.588
people do in their free time.
This is Jason Scott form the
Internet Archive if you run into

00:07:35.588-->00:07:40.627
him at Def Con, give him a hug,
he's a good guy. And the other
question you might be asking is

00:07:40.627-->00:07:46.833
a Cray is an exotic machine,
it's something cool from history
why do I give a s**t about a

00:07:46.833-->00:07:51.204
386? And fundamentally the
machine we're gonna be talking
about is a 386 with a math co

00:07:51.204-->00:07:56.710
processor so maybe closer to a
486 or a 387 whatever you wanna
call it, that's what it is, the

00:07:56.710-->00:08:02.982
importance of it is where it's
at in history, what it did. And
you should never judge a book by

00:08:02.982-->00:08:08.822
it's data, like, this guy writes
140 character messages and they
are considered incredibly

00:08:08.822-->00:08:13.593
important, I'm not getting into
the politics of the person, but
the data is important it it

00:08:13.593-->00:08:18.498
defines aspects of our life, it
defines market movements, and
things like that, and I know

00:08:18.498-->00:08:21.868
europeans have this approach to
data that says things should
have- we have a right to be

00:08:21.868-->00:08:25.705
forgotten, Star Wars Kid has a
right to be forgotten, he
shouldn't be judged his entire

00:08:25.705-->00:08:32.178
life based off of a five minute
video but at the same time we're
losing so much data that defines

00:08:32.178-->00:08:35.949
who we are and is important in
understanding the scope and
impact of things that are of

00:08:35.949-->00:08:41.888
historical significance and
sometimes the context matters.
The Trump Presidential Library

00:08:41.888-->00:08:48.395
ironically does expose a major
flaw in our archival knowledge.
He writes so much s**t on

00:08:48.395-->00:08:52.832
Twitter, he just did a policy
initiative on Twitter, and
announced it there. That for the

00:08:52.832-->00:08:57.036
first time ever internet
archivists who are real
archivists actually have to

00:08:57.036-->00:09:01.341
figure out how they're gonna
address social media. How do we
get this data, store it, put it

00:09:01.341-->00:09:05.278
in a library because it is
important, it's- it's incredibly
important for future historians

00:09:05.278-->00:09:11.084
to understand how legislature
evolved, how historically these
things occurred. And the other

00:09:11.084-->00:09:14.254
one in this list is Soundcloud,
I'm- I'm not sure how many of
you are familiar with

00:09:14.254-->00:09:20.693
Soundcloud, but Soundcloud is a
cultural um I'm not sure what
you call that, just a huge

00:09:20.693-->00:09:25.965
value. It's all these ar-
artists producing music, and
then disappearing. Or becoming

00:09:25.965-->00:09:30.870
popular, but there's so much
music in there that defines our
culture as we evolve across an

00:09:30.870-->00:09:35.575
entire geo- geo political
spectrum, as the internet begins
to bring us together, we get to

00:09:35.575-->00:09:42.048
see these independent components
start to, to meld and uh they
just announced 40 percent

00:09:42.048-->00:09:45.552
layoffs and there's a real fear
that Soundcloud will disappear
and then all the data will

00:09:45.552-->00:09:49.889
disappear and a lot of these
artists won't be able to repost
it. So the internet archive's

00:09:49.889-->00:09:54.894
trying to figure that out. I
recommend donating if you give a
c**p. Um GRiD, why is the GRiD

00:09:57.030-->00:10:02.168
Laptop important? The GRiD
laptop was the first laptop,
arguably. It was the first

00:10:02.168-->00:10:07.373
clamshell ever and uh that was
the GRiD Compass that was the
pre generator, prior to the ones

00:10:07.373-->00:10:13.346
we're going to be talking about
which are GRiD Case. Um this URL
highly recommend grabbing it's

00:10:13.346-->00:10:18.818
uh Computer History Museum got 4
of the original founders of GRiD
to talk about how GrID was

00:10:18.818-->00:10:24.123
developed, what it was important
for, and it's kind of a great
loser's story for the Pirates of

00:10:24.123-->00:10:28.828
Silicon Valley. These guys
developed their own laptop, the
first one ever, it was

00:10:28.828-->00:10:33.233
beautiful, they had Xerox PAR-
park people, they stole people
from the early Apple and they

00:10:33.233-->00:10:37.937
developed their own first
operating system called GRiD OS
and then they sat in a meeting

00:10:37.937-->00:10:41.741
with IBM and IBM was like 'hey
would you like to license our-
your operating system for our

00:10:41.741-->00:10:46.646
new IBM PC?' and they said 'no
of course not why would we do
that?' And then MS-DOS destroyed

00:10:46.646-->00:10:53.419
them. Billiot- Bill Gates is
personally responsible for
annihilating GRiD. and uh here's

00:10:53.419-->00:10:58.625
a further NASA history provided
by one of the engineers that
worked on GRiD. The Compass was

00:10:58.625-->00:11:03.696
the first laptop in space by a
matter of microseconds. TI had a
laptop on the same shuttle

00:11:03.696-->00:11:07.433
flight- and you have to think
about this, this is the first
personal computer that made it

00:11:07.433-->00:11:12.472
into space. That's huge! It's
the tri-quarter, it's it's the
first time that uh an an

00:11:12.472-->00:11:16.009
astronaut's able to use a
computer on the space shuttle
that isn't like a guidance

00:11:16.009-->00:11:20.713
system or a component that
specifically does a job. It- It
changed the way we approach

00:11:20.713-->00:11:26.419
space. Um GRiDs were huge in the
US government as well. A lot of
people who know anything about

00:11:26.419-->00:11:30.757
GRiDs know that they have a- a
reputation as being the
government's computer as being

00:11:30.757-->00:11:33.693
the rugged computer, they
originally were designed for
businessmen and none of that's

00:11:33.693-->00:11:37.463
entirely true but the US
government did use a lot of
them. The NSA used em. They had

00:11:37.463-->00:11:43.069
a software written called
Scrubbing Bubbles that scrubbed
bubble memory of any data. Um

00:11:43.069-->00:11:48.241
the NRO used em, supposedly the
football was at one point a
GRiD. Uh NASA used them, SPAWAR

00:11:48.241-->00:11:52.145
and other military forces used
em, supposedly these guys
brought, you know, demolition

00:11:52.145-->00:11:56.416
charges with them to destroy em
when they were you know
potentially compromised. And

00:11:56.416-->00:12:03.156
marines and aliens in 1986- used
em to fight aliens, so. There's
a gratuitous shot of a GRiD

00:12:03.156-->00:12:08.194
fighting aliens [laughter] I
know a lot of you were expecting
me to be like, 'I found aliens

00:12:08.194-->00:12:14.601
on the laptop' this is as close
as I got. But before we get into
the task of ripping apart this,

00:12:14.601-->00:12:19.105
let's talk about how the h**l
you get your hands on old NASA
gear and this is kind of a big

00:12:19.105-->00:12:23.977
storyline. Um you can buy pretty
much anything as- at a
government auction. The uh

00:12:23.977-->00:12:28.815
government auctions occur as
like- Govliquidation Com or all
these private enterprises that

00:12:28.815-->00:12:34.387
sell stuff or they occur at a
state level, New York State for
instance has an EBAY store and

00:12:34.387-->00:12:37.924
stuff gets sold there I mean
it's whenever they're done with
it and it no longer has value it

00:12:37.924-->00:12:44.130
gets sold and uh this is a great
quote from a French guy,
Francois, he was talking to a

00:12:44.130-->00:12:48.134
guy on Ebay who got visited by
the FBI and they were like 'hey
where the h**l did you get all

00:12:48.134-->00:12:55.041
this s**t?' cuz he started
selling some stuff on Ebay and
he had gotten it as scrap and

00:12:55.041-->00:13:01.848
what he was selling was Apollo
Guidance Computers [laughter]
anyone who knows anything about

00:13:01.848-->00:13:06.719
NASA or your own history knows
the Apollo Guidance Computer is
the first micro controller in

00:13:06.719-->00:13:11.457
silicon, it is a formative
component of all of
technological history, as we

00:13:11.457-->00:13:15.795
were landing people on the moon,
we developed the first silicon
parts, and we developed the

00:13:15.795-->00:13:20.800
first silicon micro controller.
So everything that any of you do
is in- is impacted by this, this

00:13:23.102-->00:13:28.107
device. And the AGC is
formative. Some guy in France
bought it off an Ebay guy who

00:13:32.245-->00:13:37.517
just happened to have a fully
functional AGC. How does this
happen? Like how does the AGC-

00:13:37.517-->00:13:41.187
any of them make it out into the
world where some guy can buy it
on Ebay, why was it sold as

00:13:41.187-->00:13:46.192
scrap? Nobody can tell you. And
yet this one guy in France, if
you hit his Youtube feed, has an

00:13:49.629-->00:13:56.335
AGC. Um I do recommend when
you're done after this, he's got
a great breakdown of how you

00:13:56.335-->00:14:02.542
access memory, how he read some
of the data, and uh he talks
about the operating system, he

00:14:02.542-->00:14:06.679
can't pull the operating system
off the AGC he has without
destroying it although there is

00:14:06.679-->00:14:12.318
a copy of data for another AGC
component that he doesn't have
um the question is how do we

00:14:12.318-->00:14:16.456
preserve the data that was on an
AGC? And some of you may know
that that's out there now, it's

00:14:16.456-->00:14:22.595
on GitHub. Uh the way it was
preserved is one guy went to MIT
and found the printed copies of

00:14:22.595-->00:14:27.767
all of the source code and
transcribed them into a laptop.
And he did this about 7 or 8

00:14:27.767-->00:14:34.107
years ago and uh just recently a
NASA intern found out about it
and posted it to GitHub and

00:14:34.107-->00:14:40.413
suddenly there's poll request
against you know 1960s software
[laughter] People were founding

00:14:40.413-->00:14:46.853
bugs. So in this case we found
software hiding in hard copy,
that's pretty cool. So you're

00:14:46.853-->00:14:50.890
al- some of you might be sitting
here going this is entertaining,
but it's- it's not great, we're

00:14:50.890-->00:14:55.628
talking about formative
components of our history this
is like, Wilbur and Orville's

00:14:55.628-->00:15:02.068
first flight, these, the- try to
imagine going to a yard sale and
finding the first airplane, it

00:15:02.068-->00:15:07.807
shouldn't happen. So you might
be asking yourself, well what do
I do about it? Where in my life

00:15:07.807-->00:15:14.247
do I find this sort of history
lying around? And what I want to
tell you is this is Def Con man,

00:15:14.247-->00:15:19.085
there's history happening here
today. People are developing
things, doing things, you don't

00:15:19.085-->00:15:24.557
know it at the time, I was at
HAR, Hacking at Random in 2009,
getting camera'd with a bunch of

00:15:24.557-->00:15:30.163
Italians that there- at their
embassy, and two years later I'm
watching in the news, and then

00:15:30.163-->00:15:36.035
I'm watching in a movie that
exact event occurring because
there was this young blonde

00:15:36.035-->00:15:40.173
haired jerk who was like 'I'm
going to put all of your secrets
on the internet' and that

00:15:40.173-->00:15:46.045
happened, so Wikileaks basically
occurred initially lat HAR.
History is happening all around

00:15:46.045-->00:15:51.117
us, all the time. So you might
be asking specifically, 'well
that's not like a NASA flight

00:15:51.117-->00:15:54.420
system, how the h**l do you get
your hands on a NASA flight
system?' I found them being

00:15:54.420-->00:15:59.592
auctioned um there are a couple
auctions that specialize in
space memorabilia and some of

00:15:59.592-->00:16:02.929
the lesser ones, not like
Christie's, which will sell you
things for ten grand will sell

00:16:02.929-->00:16:06.132
you things for nothing at all,
because nobody knows what they
are or whether or not they're

00:16:06.132-->00:16:09.402
important. The space shuttle is
one of those areas where nobody
really cares because it's not

00:16:09.402-->00:16:13.973
Apollo, we didn't land on the
moon and a lot of people don't
see it as formative, even though

00:16:13.973-->00:16:17.176
it's the early days of
spaceflight, we're talking about
the first laptops in space and

00:16:17.176-->00:16:22.181
yet nobody cares, but they will,
it's history. If you're ordering
from an auction be careful,

00:16:25.451-->00:16:30.690
everything about auctions are
shady. A lot of upper tier
auction houses put a lot of

00:16:30.690-->00:16:35.995
effort into establishing where
something came from, what it is,
we're going to talk in a moment

00:16:35.995-->00:16:41.367
about how you identify an
artifact and authenticate it.
Auctions don't necessarily do

00:16:41.367-->00:16:45.938
that. This is the original
auction that I saw, there's two
of them a year apart, the first

00:16:45.938-->00:16:50.943
one was the STS-41 PS - PGSC um
as far as I can tell, they made
that up. Uh the space shuttle

00:16:54.480-->00:16:58.384
payload and general support
computer that came later, they
didn't make up, I guess the

00:16:58.384-->00:17:02.989
first one had some paperwork
with it so they just kind of
assumed, the other one, had none

00:17:02.989-->00:17:05.825
so they just also kinda were
like, 'well we have this thing,
but we don't know where it's

00:17:05.825-->00:17:10.062
providence is from' Uh you might
be wondering how much these
things cost me when I bought

00:17:10.062-->00:17:15.268
them, they ca- the first one I
actually put in the bid for
1,337 dollars [laughter] and

00:17:15.268-->00:17:20.273
that's what I got it for uh
second one a little bit less. Um
so authenticating artifacts,

00:17:23.609-->00:17:30.349
this is important uh as some of
you may know, I once forged
Shmoocon badges um easiest way

00:17:30.349-->00:17:33.819
was visually at first, because
you're looking at images on the
internet, how do you visually

00:17:33.819-->00:17:39.292
identify this as being accurate,
this is a Smithsonian shot, from
the Smithsonian website saying

00:17:39.292-->00:17:44.497
this is a PGSC GRiD case as
opposed to a compass there are
things that you can identify

00:17:44.497-->00:17:50.603
immediately the blue velcro,
NASA loves velcro, they love
that light blue color uh look

00:17:50.603-->00:17:55.908
for where it is placed, that
sort of thing, look at the font
used on the text and lettering

00:17:55.908-->00:18:00.046
added, look for the modification
specifically done. You can see
that they modify the power

00:18:00.046-->00:18:05.251
supply, you can see that they
added a fan, and it's important,
the fan. Anyone who knows

00:18:05.251-->00:18:10.122
anything about space travel
knows that convection doesn't
work in zero G so any laptop

00:18:10.122-->00:18:14.627
without a fan is gonna die. It's
the same reason that an a-
astronaut will die if the

00:18:14.627-->00:18:19.198
circulation stops in any of
their spacecraft, the Co2 will
pool in front of their face and

00:18:19.198-->00:18:25.638
they'll die from C02 even though
there's plenty of oxygen, the
convection doesn't work. Hard

00:18:25.638-->00:18:30.009
Copy is the other one, if you
have the opportunity and you can
find data, you can see on there

00:18:30.009-->00:18:35.014
there was a sed number listed,
a- a part number as well um and
you can go look on either Hard

00:18:37.183-->00:18:41.187
Copy files which I didn't have a
tthe time, or you can go to
their website and look for those

00:18:41.187-->00:18:46.392
sed numbers. I found exactly one
reference to that particular sed
number. But it did identify it

00:18:46.392-->00:18:50.930
as a PGSC system and it
specifically identified that sed
number and several others. This

00:18:50.930-->00:18:55.935
comes from the NASA website,
also here's a snapshot of a
video of a NASA astronaut on the

00:18:59.372-->00:19:04.310
shuttle, working with a PGSC,
same style and design. So it
looks legit, we buy it.

00:19:07.246-->00:19:12.652
Shouldn't the memory have been
pulled right? I mean DOD did
work for NASA did work for the

00:19:12.652-->00:19:18.791
DOD in the 1990s so here's the
problem with buying something
that's from that age, you don't

00:19:18.791-->00:19:23.229
want to accidentally release
classified materials. They don't
go dead until 50 years after. So

00:19:23.229-->00:19:27.800
if you see something classified,
you don't put it on the
internet, you call your local

00:19:27.800-->00:19:32.972
government agency and say 'hey
guys I got this thing maybe you
could you know not kill me and

00:19:32.972-->00:19:37.977
take it off my hands' be a good
citizen you know. And put that
guy up there so you know I've

00:19:41.047-->00:19:45.985
got both sides of the political
spectrum. Um nothing that's ITAR
covered there's- you're not

00:19:45.985-->00:19:49.188
going to get a notification on
whether or not something's ITAR
and that means International

00:19:49.188-->00:19:53.692
Traffic in Arms Regulation and
if you ever work for a military
contract you realize that

00:19:53.692-->00:19:58.264
certain things are verboten. You
don't give them to other
countries, for instance,

00:19:58.264-->00:20:03.369
anything that might show like
how a rocket works. That could
be used for a weapon. It used to

00:20:03.369-->00:20:09.108
be that crypto used to be under
ITAR but you know not so much
these days. The other one that

00:20:09.108-->00:20:13.312
you see is this unclassified
mark that means cla-
unclassified but not for public

00:20:13.312-->00:20:18.017
release. Don't release that
either because even though it's
not dropping classified data, if

00:20:18.017-->00:20:22.388
you've ever worked for the US
government it's potential that
you violated your own release

00:20:22.388-->00:20:28.928
clauses and you might go to jail
anyways, so don't do that. Um
storing an artifact is the other

00:20:28.928-->00:20:31.764
problem, you know bought
something expensive and you
don't want to see it destroyed

00:20:31.764-->00:20:35.534
over time also if any of you
ever come across something like
this and you wanna protect it

00:20:35.534-->00:20:42.141
you wanna know how you can put
it in a shed without it you know
deteriorating. So electronics

00:20:42.141-->00:20:47.980
like beer, love beer
temperatures. Cool, not cold.
Dark. Those are the things that

00:20:47.980-->00:20:54.320
electronics love and we'll talk
about why. Um the cool
environment cold is basically

00:20:54.320-->00:20:59.592
because a lot of things don't do
well in heat, they get destroyed
over time or rapidly, cold is an

00:20:59.592-->00:21:04.096
arresting thing and it's
thermodynamics at the end of the
day but it's- it's better for

00:21:04.096-->00:21:10.002
everything. Uh dark is good
because some things are UV
sensitive such as ROMS, uh

00:21:10.002-->00:21:13.906
displays, signage, housings,
these things don't seem that
important to a hacker, but

00:21:13.906-->00:21:18.711
they're important for storings.
Uh not damp not humid but you
also don't want super dry

00:21:18.711-->00:21:24.316
because you could destroy rubber
gaskets. Um clean clutter super
important you don't wanna have

00:21:24.316-->00:21:29.054
rats and roaches and other
little bugs so wherever it's
stored you want it to be clean

00:21:29.054-->00:21:33.125
and you want to treat it like
evidence and that's where the
forensics side of this comes in

00:21:33.125-->00:21:36.962
anyone who does digital
forensics, you've got the
skillsets to do digital

00:21:36.962-->00:21:43.102
archeology, you mark everything,
you walk into a room you take
photos, you mark and identify

00:21:43.102-->00:21:47.540
everything, you wanna know where
it happened, how you found it,
even if you bought it from an

00:21:47.540-->00:21:51.677
auction you wanna take a photo
of the outside, see how
everything was laid out, where

00:21:51.677-->00:21:55.881
things were um in in this
laptop's case I'm gonna talk
about I'm going to be talking

00:21:55.881-->00:22:00.085
about key caps that were on the
top keys, they were falling off
as soon as I pulled the thing

00:22:00.085-->00:22:04.990
open, in fact there are several
taped to the outside, unless
they're labeled, you don't know

00:22:04.990-->00:22:10.763
where they were so you wanna get
that first photo before they all
fall off. Important. Keep logs,

00:22:10.763-->00:22:14.300
log everything you do, so that
people who come after you if
someone finds it in your house

00:22:14.300-->00:22:18.304
and you've been hit by a bus
they know what the h**l you did
and where it came from um

00:22:18.304-->00:22:22.608
paperwork and chain of custody
are huge this is something you
talk about in evidence, you talk

00:22:22.608-->00:22:27.012
about who had it when, how did
it get there as few hands as
possible on it, same deal with

00:22:27.012-->00:22:31.350
anything that's an artifact, you
wanna make sure that people know
where it came from, how it got

00:22:31.350-->00:22:35.321
there and you wanna make sure
that Jimmy who really believes
in aliens didn't get his hands

00:22:35.321-->00:22:41.627
on it and added a bunch of data,
you know? Um when working with
the unit try to have someone

00:22:41.627-->00:22:44.563
else in the room cause what
happens if you open the case and
you find a wristwatch in there

00:22:44.563-->00:22:48.767
and you're now like 'well this
is part of it' but everyone else
is like 'that's just a random

00:22:48.767-->00:22:54.907
thing from Caseo you found', you
know? And log everything you do,
plan every action, don't ever do

00:22:54.907-->00:22:59.078
anything outside the plan.
That's a hard one for us because
we are very free form, and

00:22:59.078-->00:23:03.649
anyone who breaks computers is
definitely freeform it's what we
do but you do need to plan this

00:23:03.649-->00:23:06.418
is what I'm gonna do today,
these are the things I'm gonna
do, and here's how I'm gonna try

00:23:06.418-->00:23:11.257
to do it and if you fail you're
done for the day you do it again
the next day. This avoids you

00:23:11.257-->00:23:14.560
doing something stupid and
breaking something we all end up
down a rabbit hole and get

00:23:14.560-->00:23:20.833
creative, you don't want to
accidentally destroy something.
Plan stuff out. Now we're gonna

00:23:20.833-->00:23:25.804
talk about Bit Rot, every bit is
bound by thermodynamics which
means every bit will die,

00:23:25.804-->00:23:32.778
everything we love, everything
we believe in will die
eventually, sorry. [laughter]

00:23:32.778-->00:23:37.116
The lifespan of magnetic media
is about 5 to 10 years
effectively it can last about as

00:23:37.116-->00:23:42.655
long as 50 but don't expect it
and we're gonna talk about that
here the laptops that I have

00:23:42.655-->00:23:48.527
were originally commissioned in
about 92 and the discs were not
in good shape um you can fully

00:23:48.527-->00:23:53.799
expect a mechanical hard disc to
fail, they suck. Cool
environments do prolong life we

00:23:53.799-->00:23:57.536
all remember the old knock knock
knock trick where you put it in
the freezer for a little bit and

00:23:57.536-->00:24:01.874
the- the knock of death
sometimes goes away, you get
enough time to pull it off, cold

00:24:01.874-->00:24:07.146
environments help um but if it's
too dry gaskets can go and s**t
gets in and annihilates the

00:24:07.146-->00:24:12.818
disc. The other one is it's like
a car if you don't spin up the
disc regularly all of the juices

00:24:12.818-->00:24:18.791
inside, the mechanical oils and
such, capacitors, they- they-
they sit stagnant and they can

00:24:18.791-->00:24:25.431
become a problem, dangerous.
Also read heads can get stuck,
you never know. Lifespan of

00:24:25.431-->00:24:30.703
flash is a lot bigger I'm go- it
says you can expect 10 years
safely but perfectly honest,

00:24:30.703-->00:24:36.075
flash is good for about 100
years, generally. Um floating
gate's gonna be a problem in the

00:24:36.075-->00:24:41.280
end it will kill any flash
device in the end no matter what
you do. Some ROMs are UV

00:24:41.280-->00:24:45.284
sensitive so if they have an
exposed UV chip you've seen them
they've got a little glass top

00:24:45.284-->00:24:48.854
on them and you see a chip
exposed, if they're sitting in
UV they're not gonna immediately

00:24:48.854-->00:24:53.992
go but you leave them there for
you know, 3, 4 years you're
gonna start losing bits. Extreme

00:24:53.992-->00:24:58.864
heat or cold is bad for them but
not regular stuff we experience
nuclear furnaces should be

00:24:58.864-->00:25:04.470
avoided [laughter] and uh do not
store them in anything that
takes skin off of people.

00:25:04.470-->00:25:08.941
They're very resilient except
when you're on a rug and that's
where this next bit comes from,

00:25:08.941-->00:25:12.077
grounding bracelets are
important when dealing with
chips, I remember working as a

00:25:12.077-->00:25:16.949
computer engineer when I was
young and I actually annihilated
several old PDIP chips just by

00:25:16.949-->00:25:21.920
standing on a rug and static
electricity was enough to blow a
fuze and now you're not reading

00:25:21.920-->00:25:27.960
s***t. Capacitors and other
gooey elements, older stuff, if
you have anything 50 years or

00:25:27.960-->00:25:33.465
old or you encounter it don't
plug it in. Replace the f**king
capacitors, and if you don't

00:25:33.465-->00:25:37.703
want to replace capacitors for
whatever reason at least
disconnect them and check them

00:25:37.703-->00:25:41.440
first to see if they're still
firing within the tolerances
that you're expecting. Most

00:25:41.440-->00:25:45.577
people what they do though is
they'll actually haul them out
and put the new capacitor inside

00:25:45.577-->00:25:51.183
the old one so you get the same
aesthetic um I restore some old
radios and that's how they do

00:25:51.183-->00:25:57.356
it. Anything new is going to die
a lot quicker than anything old.
We have laptops and motherboards

00:25:57.356-->00:26:01.560
that die within 3 years because
some of the caps just go that
quickly they- are s**t's more

00:26:01.560-->00:26:08.400
sensitive, it dies quicker. Um
and when powering on thermal
imaging can be super helpful.

00:26:08.400-->00:26:13.372
What you're seeing in this image
is basically me trying to power
on the laptop much later on and

00:26:13.372-->00:26:17.109
you can actually see the
residual heat from the power
supply we attached to it, this

00:26:17.109-->00:26:21.013
was not stock, and you can see
power distribution running
through one of the cables and

00:26:21.013-->00:26:25.784
then going nowhere. That's about
a 3 degree variance and it
lights up like a Christmas tree.

00:26:25.784-->00:26:31.089
If you see something approaching
a thermal shock value, it's
gonna light up a lot faster. So

00:26:31.089-->00:26:35.761
this is ghetto but it'll give
you a pretty good idea if
something's gone horribly wrong

00:26:35.761-->00:26:42.034
and usually with enough time to
pull the power. Um before you
get into going into the elements

00:26:42.034-->00:26:46.505
let's talk about physical
inspection the device- of the
device. We pulled out two of em

00:26:46.505-->00:26:50.108
initially I had one a year prior
to the other but this is a photo
of two of them together. You can

00:26:50.108-->00:26:54.112
do an initial physical
inspection as we talked about
you can see the uh the speaker

00:26:54.112-->00:27:00.285
uh the- the fan. Good indicator
that it's- it's a space laptop,
velcro good indicator. You can

00:27:00.285-->00:27:04.990
also see sed numbers which
helped us identify it in space
you can also see the key caps

00:27:04.990-->00:27:09.495
taped to the outside, that's not
a good sign. The other thing you
can see is the back the backs

00:27:09.495-->00:27:13.866
interesting cause it tells us
this laptop was modified this
tells us it was a flight system.

00:27:13.866-->00:27:19.538
The power adaptor's been
changed. There's also two high
density ports where the modems

00:27:19.538-->00:27:24.042
used to be so if you find the
back of an old 1530 or 1520 and
take a look at it you'll

00:27:24.042-->00:27:29.248
discover that those are just
standard RJ45 modem ports and
the power supply was just a

00:27:29.248-->00:27:35.187
standard socket, now gone. This
is the front, you pop it open,
looks like a standard old 1980's

00:27:35.187-->00:27:40.292
laptop, pretty cool, you gotta
love the keyboard. And uh you
also see the key caps, key caps

00:27:40.292-->00:27:44.663
are interesting and they're
gonna become more interesting
later. You also see a little

00:27:44.663-->00:27:49.501
door and if you flip it open you
find two app ROMs sitting in
there and you go 'hi there,

00:27:49.501-->00:27:54.806
what's your name?' You got you
26, and you 25 and what that
tells you is somebody didn't

00:27:54.806-->00:28:00.178
pull the data from the unit, you
got Christmas. It's- It's a
great feeling and you also know

00:28:00.178-->00:28:05.817
because it's an app ROM it
probably didn't die so you pull
it out you throw it in your uh

00:28:05.817-->00:28:10.122
your little universal programmer
and hit the read button and you
can read all the data right off

00:28:10.122-->00:28:16.461
uh the GQs are kinda nice
granted but they only run on
Windows. And uh you run strings

00:28:16.461-->00:28:19.131
because you're a hacker and you
know how to read a binary the
first time you see it, and it's

00:28:19.131-->00:28:24.670
the 1980s no one was obfuscating
s***t so you run strings. And
you see a copyright, some guy

00:28:24.670-->00:28:31.510
from GRiD in 1988 his- he was
funny, he's like 'my name's
Slick'. So you get internet

00:28:31.510-->00:28:36.748
sleuth mode here's a photo of me
in internet stock art you know
sleuthing. And you find Timothy

00:28:36.748-->00:28:41.219
Slick Carlson and you send him
an email because Timothy Slicks
Carlson like everyone is on

00:28:41.219-->00:28:45.591
Linkedin and he lives in the
Philippines and he's retired
now, he's an awesome dude and

00:28:45.591-->00:28:51.730
Timothy responds and goes, 'holy
s***t you found my code'
[laughter] Tim had no idea that

00:28:51.730-->00:28:55.867
any of it had ever been on the-
in space but he knew that the
government had bought them, he

00:28:55.867-->00:28:59.504
knew that it had been used for
stuff, but he was also kinda
like, 'that's my code, but

00:28:59.504-->00:29:02.841
that's my code from 1988 and
these laptops are from like the
90's why the h**l are they still

00:29:02.841-->00:29:07.713
using it?' he also was like,
'some of your code's from Peter
Norton which we would never have

00:29:07.713-->00:29:12.718
used' so he's giving us a pretty
good idea that maybe these are
not things from GRiD and then he

00:29:15.354-->00:29:19.825
being a hacker starts you know
hex sevening and pulling out and
running in DOSbox and starts

00:29:19.825-->00:29:23.762
telling us you know the language
it's written in and he's a super
happy guy and tellin' us all the

00:29:23.762-->00:29:27.499
information we ever wanted to
know. And that's where our story
about the GRiD being the first

00:29:27.499-->00:29:33.305
in space came from. He also
pointed out this, there's an
echo line in one of the scripts

00:29:33.305-->00:29:39.845
that identifies the laptop as a
PGSC Application ROM Diagnostics
Utility, PGSC is payload and

00:29:39.845-->00:29:43.682
general support computer says it
outside on the case, that's how
it was advertised which means

00:29:43.682-->00:29:49.021
whoever put this thing together,
custom built an app ROM for it,
so it's probably not fake,

00:29:49.021-->00:29:54.493
right? Somebody wrote an app
ROM, who would do that? And
there's another uh thing that

00:29:54.493-->00:29:59.898
comes up when you start
researching PGSC and that's a
thing called SPOC um it's

00:29:59.898-->00:30:04.069
obviously not a reference to
Star Trek, uh everyone who's
ever mentioned it from US

00:30:04.069-->00:30:09.408
government has very clearly said
it's not a man- it has nothing
to do with with Star Trek but it

00:30:09.408-->00:30:15.847
is the space shuttle uh personal
onboard computer, the first
laptop in space and the PGSC is

00:30:15.847-->00:30:21.286
the pregenerator when they
switched over to GRiD case and
the GRiD compass and The SPOC

00:30:21.286-->00:30:25.791
has a marked moment in history
as being the first laptop in
space, being the first time they

00:30:25.791-->00:30:30.228
added one of the most important
applications that they've ever
had and we'll get to that in a

00:30:30.228-->00:30:34.900
moment, but here you can see the
Smithsonian for instance
pointing out it has nothing to

00:30:34.900-->00:30:41.640
do with Star Trek. Here is a
SPOC in a forward compartment of
the orbiter. Orbiter's just nerd

00:30:41.640-->00:30:46.545
for space shuttle and anyone who
ever says orbiter they're either
from the 1980's and have a beard

00:30:46.545-->00:30:51.550
and worked at NASA or they're a
comic book nerd. According to
the people who worked at GRiD at

00:30:53.952-->00:30:59.858
the time the SPOC survived the
Challenger disaster, to give uh
credit to the uh the compasses

00:30:59.858-->00:31:04.162
where credit is due, they were
incredibly resilient machines
and they used uh thing called

00:31:04.162-->00:31:08.633
bubble memory. So supposedly
these two machines that were on
the uh the Challenger did

00:31:08.633-->00:31:13.638
survive. Uh the PGSC took over
for the SPOC in 1988 the P- The
SPOC was very limited it ran

00:31:16.041-->00:31:21.012
basically two applications we're
gonna talk about one of them
that we've been able to recover

00:31:21.012-->00:31:25.016
but the other one's basically
lost to history. The second ah-
the first one was a tracking

00:31:25.016-->00:31:29.454
application for the order, the
second one was basically a run
book application where if they

00:31:29.454-->00:31:35.093
saw an error code they could
type it in, get a list of what
to do. It sounds ridiculous to

00:31:35.093-->00:31:37.996
us that this is something that
would have been a problem back
then but you have to remember

00:31:37.996-->00:31:42.734
that they're up there in space
on a very complex machine with
limited communications and no

00:31:42.734-->00:31:49.040
digital equipment at the time.
Uh they didn't really have an
app store but it is important to

00:31:49.040-->00:31:53.345
note that GRiD did have it's own
version of cloud storage in the
1980s. A little bit ahead of

00:31:53.345-->00:31:58.650
their time. This is the shuttle
tracking application as it was
written uh before this they had

00:31:58.650-->00:32:01.787
to do dead reckoning which means
they had to basically look out
the window and see where they

00:32:01.787-->00:32:05.557
were to figure out where they
were over Earth, there was no
other way to figure it out other

00:32:05.557-->00:32:10.095
than asking ground control and
letting them figure it out. So
this is the application that

00:32:10.095-->00:32:13.698
most of these laptops were
initially set up to run and
that's why there was usually one

00:32:13.698-->00:32:19.771
in the cockpit it would d-
identify where over Earth they
were. This application is

00:32:19.771-->00:32:25.143
available on the URL that I
posted you can grab it and if
you can get it to run it's

00:32:25.143-->00:32:30.148
basically GRiD OS emulated
running in DOS. Um and now that
we've visually inspected the

00:32:32.484-->00:32:38.156
laptops, let's get onto the fun
stuff. I went a little further
into digging into data that's

00:32:38.156-->00:32:41.459
out there, you wanna cross
corroborate when you're doing
digital archeology, it's not as

00:32:41.459-->00:32:45.764
much fun as the hacking part,
but it's going to tell you
important things. Supposedly

00:32:45.764-->00:32:50.635
this was for STS-41 so the first
thing I did was pull up all of
the image data on STS-41, here

00:32:50.635-->00:32:55.640
you can see an astronaut
sleeping next to a PGSC system
it is about mid riff to their-

00:32:57.742-->00:33:03.849
to their right. Um none of these
matched up with the laptops I
had, the serial numbers if I

00:33:03.849-->00:33:08.086
could see them didn't match and
there was no key caps on them so
this was a pretty good indicator

00:33:08.086-->00:33:11.857
these were not the ones I was
looking for. But the PGSCs were
used for a lot of stuff, some of

00:33:11.857-->00:33:16.394
them were actually used for
ground development to develop uh
different payloads for

00:33:16.394-->00:33:20.332
scientific missions, some of
them were automated check and
verify that the payloads

00:33:20.332-->00:33:25.136
running, one of them was used
for the original GPS analysis,
when they deployed the first GPS

00:33:25.136-->00:33:28.773
satellites they wanted to make
sure they had gotten it right
and they fired up a PGSC system

00:33:28.773-->00:33:34.646
which was a GRiDcase 1530 to
connect to the first GPS
receiver and identify they were

00:33:34.646-->00:33:40.318
getting the correct data. The
PGSC interestingly did not have
an orbiter communications link,

00:33:40.318-->00:33:44.789
it had no internet, it was not
linked to anything. There was
possible to put a multiplexer in

00:33:44.789-->00:33:48.360
but they didn't do that so that
gives you pretty good scope of
what these things did and what

00:33:48.360-->00:33:53.198
their purpose was. Now this was
a great photo when I saw this,
this was about 3am and I'm

00:33:53.198-->00:33:57.335
digging and I'm finding nothing,
and then I find this guy and
this was a later mission, this

00:33:57.335-->00:34:01.506
is STS-94, the later missions
they had better cameras so I
could read the day- the serial

00:34:01.506-->00:34:06.511
numbers and the serial number on
that one I believe is SN 1073
which is the highest serial

00:34:06.511-->00:34:11.983
number I saw, the ones I have
are SN1044 and SN1045 with
references to 43 and 46 in the

00:34:11.983-->00:34:16.288
paperwork. I see an SN 1001 in
the first PGSC system that I see
that's a GRiD case. So they made

00:34:16.288-->00:34:21.293
probably at least 73 GRiD cases.
Um what's interesting about this
one though is if you look real

00:34:27.232-->00:34:32.270
careful you can tell that a
bunch of the keys in the app
function level have key cap

00:34:32.270-->00:34:37.275
tops, they have stickers on
them. This one, STS-64, no key
caps, but you can also see that

00:34:39.711-->00:34:45.850
there's another laptop hidden
underneath. You look at one of
mine, those are the key caps,

00:34:45.850-->00:34:51.323
pretty important. Here you can
see em again, STS-47 has the key
caps but you can also see

00:34:51.323-->00:34:56.828
there's no SAIC logo over the
app ROMS, a bunch of them had
SAIC logos, a bunch didn't it

00:34:56.828-->00:35:02.100
seemed like the earlier units in
the PGSCs didn't have SAIC- did
have SAIC logos, later ones

00:35:02.100-->00:35:07.138
didn't, didn't contractor did
the afterwork and changed the
logos out. Here you can see a

00:35:07.138-->00:35:12.143
SAIC logo next to a non SAIC
logo, no keycaps, key caps. It's
a later laptop. So what's

00:35:15.780-->00:35:19.250
interesting about the key cap
ones is they're all related to
space lab and microgravity

00:35:19.250-->00:35:25.223
science laboratory. All the uh
flights correspondence missions,
anything related to those key

00:35:25.223-->00:35:30.095
tabs seemed to be related to
space lab. These systems
probably didn't fly because all

00:35:30.095-->00:35:36.401
the space lab photos I could
find are either S/N 106 units or
S/N 1073 units. That's where I

00:35:36.401-->00:35:40.872
am right now, just doing visual
inspection. Now let's look at
the paperwork that came with one

00:35:40.872-->00:35:45.844
of them one of them came with a
folio bunch of paperwork, the
other one came with nothing.

00:35:45.844-->00:35:49.047
What's interesting about this
particular piece of paperwork is
it tells us how much these

00:35:49.047-->00:35:54.619
things cost, 40K, in current
dollars that's about 70-->000
dollars a pop. The original

00:35:54.619-->00:36:00.025
retail value on one of those
laptops is about 5-->000 so they
paid about 35-->000 extra dollars

00:36:00.025-->00:36:04.029
to have them modified for flight
and they probably had about 73
of these done between 1988 and

00:36:04.029-->00:36:09.034
1997 to give you an idea of cost
of just this system. Also
interesting here is you have a

00:36:11.202-->00:36:16.241
rea- a- a life history log which
tells you things about dates,
when was it first in the NASA

00:36:16.241-->00:36:21.246
receipt? And that's 1992. So
it's definitely not a um it's
definitely was reduced to a

00:36:25.150-->00:36:29.754
ground system in 92, vanished
for 2 years and came back in 94
as part of the space lab. You

00:36:29.754-->00:36:34.359
can see a full life history log
that's again corresponding and
you can see the modifications,

00:36:34.359-->00:36:39.364
40 megabit hard disc, RS-422
diagnostic P-ROMs, Epoxy
everywhere and that RS-422

00:36:42.000-->00:36:46.137
connector thing tells us what
one of the boards is. This was a
heavy modification, it was the

00:36:46.137-->00:36:50.708
most odd modification inside the
laptop, it's an entirely custom
board that replaces the modem.

00:36:50.708-->00:36:55.914
This was an R- RS-422 serial
interface made by Rockwell
International that interfaced

00:36:55.914-->00:37:00.819
with the space shuttle. So we're
gonna remove the housing and get
in there and actually look at

00:37:00.819-->00:37:04.923
some of the hardware right now.
You see the appROMs, you see me
trying to replace one of the

00:37:04.923-->00:37:09.427
batteries and turn it on, that
failed. But you can also see
that they modified the battery,

00:37:09.427-->00:37:12.831
they changed the way it
interfaced so that they could
swap the battery out, that

00:37:12.831-->00:37:17.802
wasn't a stock modification, you
see epoxy in all the chips. You
can see our lifelogs that were

00:37:17.802-->00:37:22.874
added to it and you can see that
one of them ran for 3,700 hours
the other one for about 1,500,

00:37:22.874-->00:37:28.680
that's a long time. This was not
space shuttle use. You can also
see that they had an odd and

00:37:28.680-->00:37:34.185
even bios and you'll see that in
a lot of old computers where
they had like a 16 bit bus but 8

00:37:34.185-->00:37:38.823
bit bios chips it would put odds
and evens on the memory in there
so you- they'd be interleaved

00:37:38.823-->00:37:43.828
when you pulled them out. We
tried to pull it out initially
with a dip- uh dip 28 cable and

00:37:45.964-->00:37:49.801
it didn't work because their
power was still attached and I
didn't want to cut the ca- the

00:37:49.801-->00:37:53.505
power cable, so if you ever
wanna do this, you have to cut
the power and ground so that

00:37:53.505-->00:37:57.909
you're not attempting to power
the entire laptop when you're
pulling the data off the chip.

00:37:57.909-->00:38:01.646
We lucked out however, initially
I thought they were just
soldered in because of all the

00:38:01.646-->00:38:04.849
epoxy, but they weren't there
was actually a socket board
there so we were actually able

00:38:04.849-->00:38:08.620
to pull it out and we were able
to get the bios off which was
super important cause the disc

00:38:08.620-->00:38:14.959
geometry information for the IDE
discs was in the bios. The IDE
discs were terrible, they were

00:38:14.959-->00:38:19.130
developed by a company called
Conner. Conner is in Scotland
and Scotland should feel ashamed

00:38:19.130-->00:38:24.302
for ever having produced these
people. [laughter] This is what
Tim Carlson who worked at GRiD

00:38:24.302-->00:38:29.073
had to say about the Conners, he
was 'oh no Conner Peripherals'
apparently they had a problem

00:38:29.073-->00:38:33.878
called 'stiction' in which the
read heads would stick on the
disc and their line engineers

00:38:33.878-->00:38:38.883
would you know being the 1980s
hit it with their knuckles and
let it keep going. So I had high

00:38:41.219-->00:38:47.292
hopes for this when it actually
spun up, that was not the case
however, uh it did spu- spin but

00:38:47.292-->00:38:52.096
they were very corrupted uh I
needed to find an ATA card
because they did not have an

00:38:52.096-->00:38:56.668
ability to understand LBA and
anything USB throws LBA at it it
eventually went 'just go oh

00:38:56.668-->00:39:01.773
that's CSH, I know that!' and
starts feeding the wrong data.
So we found an old ATA card,

00:39:01.773-->00:39:05.610
managed to get GNU ddrescue to
run which was the only thing
that was able to apparently

00:39:05.610-->00:39:10.515
continually try and pull data,
and what we ended up pulling was
about 20 megs of a 40 meg hard

00:39:10.515-->00:39:16.421
disc, randomly spread out, but
enough to figure out what was on
it. And it was basically MS DOS

00:39:16.421-->00:39:22.760
it was running Do- diagnostic
ROM software, it was called a
DDSE flight mode system. And um

00:39:22.760-->00:39:26.698
inside you can see some of the
strings, uh, what the
interesting one on the right

00:39:26.698-->00:39:31.870
shows a file listing and I've
been unable yet although I've
only been into one laptop's

00:39:31.870-->00:39:35.673
disc, the other one I have not
been into, has a thing called
astro 2 dot bat which could be

00:39:35.673-->00:39:39.944
real interesting because I've
never seen that one on any of
the paperwork, app wise. But

00:39:39.944-->00:39:45.049
most of its diagnostic data and
you can see Tim Carlson again
showing up all over the d***n

00:39:45.049-->00:39:49.821
place having written all of the
diagnostic data for these
machines. The binaries if you

00:39:49.821-->00:39:53.691
want if you want to dig into
them with me are actually on
PGSC dot space and uh we're

00:39:53.691-->00:39:55.693
working on restoring right now a
stock GRiD 1520 to run some of
the applications but it's

00:39:55.693-->00:39:57.695
basically dead um one of the
things we have to do is actually
drummle open a- a CMOS chip and

00:39:57.695-->00:40:02.700
then hot wire it and we're
working on that but the next
thing is replacing the display.

00:40:10.341-->00:40:15.680
Lessons learned here are that my
weak a*s methodology did yield
results. We cross corroborated

00:40:15.680-->00:40:19.917
between multiple sources, we
identified these laptops were
NASA systems, they were flight

00:40:19.917-->00:40:24.289
modified, we know the time spans
they operated in, how long they
ran, we know what they did, we

00:40:24.289-->00:40:28.726
know what applications were on
there, we found the guy who
wrote em. So all of that worked

00:40:28.726-->00:40:33.364
really well, we also know that
it's pretty unlikely that these
ever flew. We went through all

00:40:33.364-->00:40:36.968
of the flight logs, all of the
flight data on Youtube and the
national archives and could not

00:40:36.968-->00:40:40.905
find the serial number that
would have matched from that sed
number that was on there, we

00:40:40.905-->00:40:46.110
also identified that the weird
a*s module that was in there was
likely an RS-42- 422 rockwell

00:40:46.110-->00:40:50.581
interface for the space shuttle.
And we figured out that they
were used primarily for long

00:40:50.581-->00:40:54.052
life testing initially they
would have been the first batch
that would've been tested before

00:40:54.052-->00:41:00.158
they went from a 711 sed number
to anything above that, the 713
is appeared to have been used

00:41:00.158-->00:41:05.930
initially to do shock testing,
in fact one of the logs in there
that's not posted shows a screw

00:41:05.930-->00:41:09.634
that came out of one of the
displays and that was a send
back to GRiD and they responded.

00:41:09.634-->00:41:16.474
Um they also did the EMI test on
it. Disks show significant bit
rot which tells us the discs

00:41:16.474-->00:41:20.345
don't survive that long even if
they're in really good shape, in
this case they were. Flash

00:41:20.345-->00:41:25.717
memory was intact. The easiest
way to do recovery work on NASA
gear is to work, there I'm gonna

00:41:25.717-->00:41:29.887
shout these guys out, I worked
there for a little bit, and
there was a group called LOIRP

00:41:29.887-->00:41:35.360
which actually did lunar
[inaudible] orbiter project they
recovered um magnetic media from

00:41:35.360-->00:41:41.265
the first lunar cause orbiters
sending back- they were sending
back perfect copies of data but

00:41:41.265-->00:41:45.636
we didn't have the da- the
capacity to read that data, we
recorded all this data but we

00:41:45.636-->00:41:49.307
didn't have the equipment at the
time to read it, so these guys
took over at McDonald's and

00:41:49.307-->00:41:54.645
started reading all the data and
found the first Earthrise photos
ever taken, amongst other

00:41:54.645-->00:42:00.284
things, high resolution images
of the moon used for plotting
landing sites. So LOIRP is a

00:42:00.284-->00:42:05.590
really cool project, I sent a
URL, next to it by the way is a
ICBM that they're working on

00:42:05.590-->00:42:10.595
restoring [laughter] And by the
way that's in the unsecured part
um i- if you wanna do this and

00:42:13.331-->00:42:17.301
you don't wanna go get a job at
NASA there's a organization
called Space Apps Challenge

00:42:17.301-->00:42:20.738
which allows you to go work on
their data, they have huge
volumes of data that nobody can

00:42:20.738-->00:42:24.208
do anything with because it's
not indexed or searchable,
nobody knows how to do anything

00:42:24.208-->00:42:28.579
with it. And we're running into
this glut of historical,
important data just being lost

00:42:28.579-->00:42:32.683
because there's so much of it
created, they get paid to do the
development, the advanced

00:42:32.683-->00:42:36.687
research, when they're done
there's no funding to put it
where it needs to be to be saved

00:42:36.687-->00:42:41.993
so if you have the opportunity
that's one way you can
contribute. So this is gonna be

00:42:41.993-->00:42:46.697
my- my thank you board it's uh
that website is going to
continue to get more data when I

00:42:46.697-->00:42:50.835
pull the next discs but it has
most of the ROMs we've done shaw
tests between them so we know

00:42:50.835-->00:42:56.174
the ROMs are not bit rotted uh
it has the disc images for the
first one as far as we've been

00:42:56.174-->00:43:00.178
able to pull them, they may get
better over time and it has a
bunch of applications and

00:43:00.178-->00:43:04.482
research papers related to PGSC
systems if you wanna read
through them including

00:43:04.482-->00:43:07.685
information on how the
applications were written at the
time, they wrote entire research

00:43:07.685-->00:43:12.123
papers on why they used DL
displays, why applications were
written the size that they were

00:43:12.123-->00:43:17.228
for tolerances and readability,
the irony was the space shuttle
at the end of the day was, 'can

00:43:17.228-->00:43:22.500
this astronaut read it'. Um
Computer History Museum, much
love to them for having given me

00:43:22.500-->00:43:27.972
an hour and a half video of the
original creator's talking about
it and to Def Con Goons etcetera

00:43:27.972-->00:43:33.377
and all those that I can not
remember so does anyone have any
questions cause we have like two

00:43:33.377-->00:43:38.382
minutes. [applause]
