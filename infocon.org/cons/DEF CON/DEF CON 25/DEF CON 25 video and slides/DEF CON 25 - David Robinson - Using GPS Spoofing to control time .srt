00:00:00.000-->00:00:05.672
>>OK, um. Thank you. Um. I'm
Dave Karit I'm a security
consultant pentester from

00:00:05.672-->00:00:12.179
Wellington, in New Zealand. Uh,
for those of you who don't know
where Wellington is [laughter]

00:00:12.179-->00:00:17.184
we're at the top of the map
there. [clapping] Um, I enjoy
sort of the radio hacking also

00:00:19.486-->00:00:26.126
the physical stuff of flox sport
and stuff like that. So, today
we're going to be looking at

00:00:26.126-->00:00:31.131
GPS, um, GPS spoofing, sort of
how we can change time and what
we can do with it. And taking

00:00:33.734-->00:00:40.007
some NTP servers and whether we
can actually detect some of the
spoofing. So just going back to

00:00:40.007-->00:00:46.146
the start, GPS can tell us where
the timers tells us and tells us
where we are and it uses the

00:00:46.146-->00:00:50.117
time to actually do the
calculations to figure out where
you are and it's called slashes

00:00:50.117-->00:00:55.122
in satellites orbiting about
20-->000 kilometers above us. Um,
so we have to trust GPS, right?

00:00:57.891-->00:01:02.829
So, does anyone currently not
trust GPS locations? Anyone not
trust GPS time currently? Does

00:01:05.832-->00:01:10.837
it ever feel they may change
their opinion by the end of this
talk? [inaudible audience

00:01:13.073-->00:01:18.679
sounds] Um. So we have to trust
GPS, right? It's too important
to life. It's got to be robust,

00:01:18.679-->00:01:23.684
the military uses it. Important
services like Uber and Tinder
and stuff require it. [laughing]

00:01:27.587-->00:01:32.259
Uh, and also some other least
important things like NTP time,
planes and ships navigating

00:01:32.259-->00:01:38.832
keeping an eye on Armid fans and
their taxi, we just changed our
taxi seat law in New Zealand and

00:01:38.832-->00:01:42.502
they removed the knowledge
requirement for the drivers
because minister of transport

00:01:42.502-->00:01:48.241
came out and basically said "Uh,
what was the last time you ever
saw a taxi driver without a GPS

00:01:48.241-->00:01:53.380
in their car?" and from my
experience, actually, since taxi
drivers have got GPS they've

00:01:53.380-->00:01:56.717
actually become worse at
actually getting to where the..
you need to go. [laughter]

00:01:56.717-->00:02:01.655
[clapping] Um, so move forward
and look at some of the techs.
There sort of been GPS jamming

00:02:04.691-->00:02:10.797
for a while now in this
particular instance, you know, a
truck driver, the manager at Pot

00:02:10.797-->00:02:15.902
GPS trackers and all their
trucks. So he didn't like being
tracked, he also liked him in

00:02:15.902-->00:02:21.975
the afternoon a nap. Um happened
one of his particular nap spot
was next to a Newark airport and

00:02:21.975-->00:02:27.581
when you mess with planes people
do sort of notice and they will
come out and actually track you

00:02:27.581-->00:02:34.254
down. And also on the GPS
jamming front apparently some of
the black cabs in um London they

00:02:34.254-->00:02:39.659
don't like Uber in lifts so
they're running GPS jammers to
mess with Uber and Lifts so they

00:02:39.659-->00:02:46.099
will come so people will use the
black cabs rather than actually
Uber and Lyft. But you know

00:02:46.099-->00:02:51.204
jammers are rather boring you
can just buy them off the.. your
favorite Chinese online store.

00:02:51.204-->00:02:56.810
They're not particularly
graceful, they just sort of jam
GPS you realize that Hey I don't

00:02:56.810-->00:03:01.748
have a GPS location, something
is amiss. Um, moving forward to
sort of a 2011. Um, supposedly

00:03:05.752-->00:03:10.757
the Iranian s..um stall crash
the US drone by doing some GPS
spoofing to try to get it to

00:03:13.293-->00:03:18.298
land or crash land in Iran.
Though this was nation state
level of cash and research. Um,

00:03:20.901-->00:03:27.374
moving forward to 2013. A
professor with some students and
two thousand dollars worth of

00:03:27.374-->00:03:33.613
server equipment managed to
steer a sh.. a ship off course.
Um, this wasn't GPS spoofing per

00:03:33.613-->00:03:40.087
say, it was the fact that they
delayed the GPS time signals
ever so slightly that the boat

00:03:40.087-->00:03:45.325
thought it was somewhere where
it wasn't so it altered course
trying to correct itself. In May

00:03:45.325-->00:03:50.330
last year, um, Unicorn team
talked about, um, using wallace
time signals to um, in uh

00:03:54.935-->00:03:59.539
attacking in Taipei with us. Um,
they looked at GPS though so
they look at some of the other

00:03:59.539-->00:04:05.979
terrestrial time sig., uh, time
sources that are sending out
over radio. Um, though from what

00:04:05.979-->00:04:10.984
I could see in they didn't
actually release any code. Then
I found this on GitHub um

00:04:13.887-->00:04:18.892
someone had written a software
to find GPS signal simulator. So
I took that, um edit in sort of

00:04:21.962-->00:04:27.901
in addition to that you need a
computer to run it on, you need
a software to find radio with

00:04:27.901-->00:04:33.039
transmit, I pe personally used a
BliteRF because that's what we
had sitting around the office at

00:04:33.039-->00:04:38.678
the time, Um, also a HackRF for
the USOP will also work. So for
less than five hundred dollars

00:04:38.678-->00:04:43.683
in hardware you can start your
GPS spoofing and as far as
software to find radio things go

00:04:46.186-->00:04:51.091
this is one this code you just
downloaded it you, you ran it
and it just worked straight out

00:04:51.091-->00:04:56.496
of the box. Sort of one of the
best experiences I've had with
software to find radio code,

00:04:56.496-->00:05:01.434
which is really nice. Um, yea.
Um, so yea, I also had it
running off of Rsupply 3. In

00:05:03.904-->00:05:08.909
that case with a battery that
case that should have BliteRF
about the biggest thing involved

00:05:11.178-->00:05:17.984
in the set up. Um, people the
regulators generally don't like
you trying to broadcast GPS

00:05:17.984-->00:05:24.958
signals so best a wrap it up in
a terabay cage with some
aluminum foil. Um, you know,

00:05:24.958-->00:05:29.963
yea. Yea, I'm not a lawyer. Um,
yea, it's not open spectrum. You
got to keep your GPS good list

00:05:33.200-->00:05:39.773
to yourself unfortunately. Um
and when you are doing this your
software to find radio

00:05:39.773-->00:05:43.343
transmitter it's going to be a
lot closer than the satellites.
Satellites are about 20-->000

00:05:43.343-->00:05:48.348
kilometers away, your, you going
to be a lot less than that. Um,
though from what I have seen of

00:05:50.383-->00:05:55.055
other people using this tool Uh
the ra.. the range is still only
whole wave length it doesn't go

00:05:55.055-->00:06:01.094
particularly well through walls
and GPS signals on the whole are
actually quite weak so on the

00:06:01.094-->00:06:06.600
left there we've got a normal
radio signal we have in the red
there we've got the noise floor

00:06:06.600-->00:06:11.538
such as the background static
and then in the green we've got
the signals so grossly

00:06:11.538-->00:06:17.244
simplifying radio stuff in this
case we can basically figure out
what the noise floor is delete

00:06:17.244-->00:06:21.781
it and you're left with just
signal. Um, but on the right
hand side there we've got the

00:06:21.781-->00:06:26.086
GPS and it's the other way
around. In red we've got the
noise floor and below the noise

00:06:26.086-->00:06:32.058
floor we've actually got the GPS
signal. So that's why GPS
processing is so much battery

00:06:32.058-->00:06:36.963
power because it's actually even
process all the noise hoping to
actually find the GPS signal.

00:06:36.963-->00:06:42.602
That's basically going to mask,
and it goes instead of GPS
signal or it's better GPS signal

00:06:42.602-->00:06:46.439
and when it doesn't take too
long it goes oh yea they do have
it and it actually start

00:06:46.439-->00:06:51.444
processing it. Um, so we got the
simulator software, I got a
blind RAF, what could we do? Um,

00:06:55.382-->00:07:01.288
you know, first simple thing, we
can just change your location.
Um, my phone was under my desk

00:07:01.288-->00:07:05.725
in the office in Wellington.
Here I've got my phone think
it's actually in Bitterly Park.

00:07:08.828-->00:07:13.633
Um, so how how does this the
tool work? Um, it had two
methods of working. The first

00:07:13.633-->00:07:18.705
one was a toast it process where
it would generate the data and
then it would broadcast it. That

00:07:18.705-->00:07:23.944
works at about a gigabyte of
data per minute. Um and it can
be a steady location or it can

00:07:23.944-->00:07:29.983
be a path so you can actually
have the GPS location moving
around . Um it also takes an

00:07:29.983-->00:07:33.753
element of where all the
satellites are going to be at a
given time so it's not

00:07:33.753-->00:07:38.091
generating just one GPS
satellite, it's not generating
an entire constellation, it will

00:07:38.091-->00:07:43.063
go at this place on earth it
should be seeing this set of
satellites at this particular

00:07:43.063-->00:07:48.068
time. Um, yet in the other
method it has it does both the
generate and the broadcast in

00:07:50.270-->00:07:55.675
one step in real time. Um,
though this does have a down
side it needs much more CPU to

00:07:55.675-->00:08:00.613
actually do this. Um, so more
limitations of the two by
default it will only generate

00:08:02.949-->00:08:07.954
five minutes of data at a time.
Um, with that um, you can just
go into the [inaudible] file,

00:08:09.989-->00:08:16.429
change it and you can do longer
I suspect. The reason for this
was didn't want microquest in

00:08:16.429-->00:08:20.600
compliance and this thing filled
up my desk screen when I was
trying generate two days worth

00:08:20.600-->00:08:24.971
of data. That means that
hopefully the person who knows
how to change the C file also

00:08:24.971-->00:08:31.578
realizes about s.. files sizes
and stuff. The Raspberry Pi 3
can't do the generation in real

00:08:31.578-->00:08:36.583
time, oop, um, heh. It tae..it
takes, um, if I was trying to
generate five minutes of data on

00:08:40.787-->00:08:45.792
Raspberry Pi 3 it would take
about fifteen minutes of actual
CPU time to generate that five

00:08:48.061-->00:08:54.067
minutes of data. Um, and also
generating a path is quite
simple you get sort of point at

00:08:54.067-->00:08:59.072
one second intervals you give it
a set of locations.
Unfortunately, you can't just

00:08:59.072-->00:09:03.843
use latitude, longitude and
altitude. Um, you have to use
earth's internet effects or nima

00:09:03.843-->00:09:08.415
data rows thus but there are
tools to do the conversion
online for you. So it becomes

00:09:08.415-->00:09:13.119
quite simple and you can start
drawing little paths in the
middle of Wilmington Harbor

00:09:13.119-->00:09:18.124
using the tool. Uh, so what can
we do with the locations
spoofing? Um, you know, other

00:09:20.160-->00:09:24.697
than you want to take it back to
your underground lair, broadcast
the path that it should be

00:09:24.697-->00:09:28.334
traveling around all the banks,
but you're actually driving it
off to your underground lair.

00:09:28.334-->00:09:33.339
Um, Uber, um has a time and a
distance component. If
[laughing] [clapping] If you

00:09:44.451-->00:09:49.222
need a lift, your actual
destination is going to have
time component and given an

00:09:49.222-->00:09:55.261
experiment..experience with
dri..uber drivers and stuff,
then never going to, they always

00:09:55.261-->00:09:59.065
blame on saying oh the map's
really bad or it's giving me bad
routes data just to assume the

00:09:59.065-->00:10:04.304
apps having a bad day than even
going to assume someone is
actually attacking them to scare

00:10:04.304-->00:10:09.709
money out of them. Um, planes
can also use GPS for landing,
particularly when it's not a

00:10:09.709-->00:10:13.680
straight landing and you can't
use the normal terrestrial base
radio stuff. There's this

00:10:13.680-->00:10:18.551
Queenstown airport in New
Zealand it's got this nice hair
pin a little she came unto

00:10:18.551-->00:10:23.790
landing through some tight
valleys and stuff, so you want
the planes navigating fairly

00:10:23.790-->00:10:28.795
accurately through that or
they'll make a big mess on the
side of a hill. Um, also we can

00:10:31.097-->00:10:35.768
change time seeing the core one
of the core things that GPS is
actually spitting out throughout

00:10:35.768-->00:10:40.773
all the calculation for
locations as its ists time so we
have NTPD. Um, which is the

00:10:42.942-->00:10:47.947
common NTP damen on limits and
unit servers. Um, if you just,
if you have the GPS receiver

00:10:51.818-->00:10:56.856
just putting material into the
computer, NTPD will knows how to
do the rest and actually uses

00:10:56.856-->00:11:01.427
the time source so with no
really additional confect
required of an [inaudible] any

00:11:01.427-->00:11:07.767
used server and the confect
file. Um, also looking at some
of the commercial NTP servers

00:11:07.767-->00:11:12.772
available on the market that do
have NTP in. Uh, sorry, GPS in.
Um they will appear to run NTPD

00:11:15.041-->00:11:20.046
under the hood and because NTPD
has its own custom license so
they have admitted in the

00:11:22.115-->00:11:27.787
documentation they've mentioned
they've got stuff licensed under
the NTPD license. Um, there's a

00:11:27.787-->00:11:32.792
wave of NTP days running under
the hood. Um, so a little bit of
taking NTP, um. If you through,

00:11:36.963-->00:11:43.570
if you try to move time in big
amounts, particularly over five
minutes, NTPD will shut down

00:11:43.570-->00:11:49.142
though there's actually no log
messages saying why it's shut
shut down and if you, when you

00:11:49.142-->00:11:53.880
start it back when you're
restarting NTPD it's just the
time has been changed. Which is

00:11:53.880-->00:11:58.885
really common because the local
motherboard clock and NTP, uh
very rarely actually correspond

00:12:00.920-->00:12:07.126
with ea.. each other cause um
motherboard clocks is
notoriously inaccurate and

00:12:07.126-->00:12:12.131
all...always trust the GPS time
or the netw..NTP network time
over the motherboard, um, clock.

00:12:14.367-->00:12:19.372
Um, if you do tune the NTPD
logging uh, to sort of debug
level, but no one actually runs

00:12:22.108-->00:12:28.348
the in production like this, um,
there is some logging which I
could kind of interpret what was

00:12:28.348-->00:12:32.018
going on because I was actually
attacking it at the time and
knew what I was doing, but if

00:12:32.018-->00:12:37.023
someone saw this actually in
real life they wouldn't think
much of it. Um, anything to big

00:12:39.659-->00:12:44.464
crashes and um and restarts
through through a watchdog or-
or- the sys admin has to get up

00:12:44.464-->00:12:49.535
at two A.M. in the morning and
at rate it just restarts
normally and continues on the

00:12:49.535-->00:12:53.673
right they aren't actually going
to look any deeper or actually
check the time that's correct a

00:12:53.673-->00:13:00.313
lot of the time. They just want
to go back to sleep. Um, but we
want to start having move this

00:13:00.313-->00:13:06.386
time um with without actually
crashing into BD because if we
are actually attacking it and so

00:13:06.386-->00:13:11.858
we have to instead of doing the
big steps we have to do lots of
little steps back in time. Sort

00:13:11.858-->00:13:17.363
of wind the clock back. Um, so I
wrote a talk called Tanjumps
it's a python script wrapped

00:13:17.363-->00:13:23.236
around that sort of myth of toe
of the GPS signal simulator. Um
the code's up on GitHub

00:13:23.236-->00:13:28.241
currently and this is sort of
designed mostly for error gap
network. So a network where

00:13:31.577-->00:13:37.817
you've got the NTP time servers
got that's getting the time from
GPS as no other network

00:13:37.817-->00:13:41.921
connection out there to the rest
of the world to get in a time
source from anywhere else or

00:13:41.921-->00:13:47.293
people who have sort of
configured badly with maybe only
GPS and one other server and the

00:13:47.293-->00:13:52.298
internet case at will almost
only trust GP..the GPS time more
than the other one because uh

00:13:54.767-->00:14:01.374
all have a lot of stratum coming
from the GPS satellite. So I
sort of my little tist set up I

00:14:01.374-->00:14:07.313
had was a little hacker on his
laptop broke out the other GPS
signal and then down at the

00:14:07.313-->00:14:12.385
bottom there I've got a NTP
receiver receiving the GPS
signal. So I've got a little

00:14:12.385-->00:14:18.091
sort of video of all of this,
um. So the local machine up on
the top left, that's their

00:14:18.091-->00:14:23.096
attacker the tiger machine that
was on the NTP server on the top
right and the bottom there I'm

00:14:23.096-->00:14:28.534
actually going to have the
script running. Um, when, yet,
so the scripts are on their way.

00:14:28.534-->00:14:33.740
Um, so it takes a little while
and there's the scripts running
and it also moves time backwards

00:14:33.740-->00:14:40.313
let it sort of give it time for
the GPS receiver to sync backup
let it run forward a little bit

00:14:40.313-->00:14:46.519
and then it will move the time
back again. You know wait for
the GPS receiver to sync up

00:14:46.519-->00:14:50.823
again and then play for a little
bit and then move the time
backwards again. So that it

00:14:50.823-->00:14:57.764
stayed rather stable. You can
move the time back a lot through
this method and it's just

00:14:57.764-->00:15:02.702
running like this. Um, so moving
on. So what can we sort of do
with these so that if we can

00:15:05.772-->00:15:11.010
change time what sort of attacks
can we do? Um, most of you have
mostly run across time one time

00:15:11.010-->00:15:15.581
passwords. Like you'll see on
Google Earth. Every thirty
seconds you'll get a new token

00:15:15.581-->00:15:20.586
to use with your login. Um, so
in this case if we can if the if
we if we move time backwards,

00:15:25.091-->00:15:31.297
what can happen here? So I've
got a little video here. Um, its
supply..yep. Doot, doot, doot,

00:15:31.297-->00:15:37.870
ta doot. So just getting to know
the the current date there. Um,
it's essentially known and then

00:15:37.870-->00:15:42.842
here I've set up it's actually
require the veri..the
verification code in addition

00:15:42.842-->00:15:47.847
to, um the password. So, there
we've logged in. So now we're
sort of going to fast forward,

00:15:53.286-->00:15:58.124
awe just captur..cap...bleh.
Copying the time just so we can
reference back to it later and

00:15:58.124-->00:16:02.161
now the video is going to fast
forward a little bit so we gots
the time is moved forward a

00:16:02.161-->00:16:07.166
little bit. Um, so we'll just
wait for that to happen.
[Silence] Do, do, do, dooooooo.

00:16:11.871-->00:16:16.876
Going forward, going forward.
[Silence] Da, da, dooo, come on.
Pht. Ta, ha, ha. There so I'm

00:16:30.656-->00:16:37.563
checking the data again now and
we see that the time has moved
forward, so we'll log in again

00:16:37.563-->00:16:44.237
and at the first, at the first
time I log in I'm going to use
the code we used before and

00:16:44.237-->00:16:49.242
we'll see that we get prompted
again for the password because
it's the incorrect one time

00:16:51.410-->00:16:56.415
password for this particular
time. Yep, so it's prompting for
the password, but if I type in

00:16:58.484-->00:17:04.724
the password and then use the
current verification
code[silence] I can log in. So,

00:17:04.724-->00:17:09.729
I'll logout, out again and I'll
fast forward it again but this
time during the, while it's

00:17:12.365-->00:17:17.904
fastforwarding I'm actually
going to be moving time
backwards again. So, the video

00:17:17.904-->00:17:22.909
is fastforwarding, time's going
to be start winding itself
backwards. After a little bit.

00:17:30.049-->00:17:33.986
[heavy breath] Do,do,do,do,doot.
So, it, there so we see time is
move back a little bit and just

00:17:33.986-->00:17:38.991
waiting for it to now, rock,
take forward to where we logged
in last time or the very first

00:17:38.991-->00:17:43.996
time, sorry. Yep, so the time's
in sync so we can, hit the
section again. Type in the

00:17:47.900-->00:17:52.905
pa...using the password and use
the same code as before and
we've logged in. [applause] So

00:18:07.720-->00:18:12.725
this was this the default lid
pan um, [mouth sounds] Google
Earth sort of time based one

00:18:15.561-->00:18:21.968
time passwords um library, Um.
Thing was when you are setting
it up it didn't heather to fault

00:18:21.968-->00:18:28.240
for years. So this is the
question we've had for years if
you just hit enter it would just

00:18:28.240-->00:18:33.179
prompt you again with these or
no. It doesn't actually say "yes
you do want reuse protection on

00:18:33.179-->00:18:39.251
because it stops, you know they
may be assuming that time only
moves forward you won't get to

00:18:39.251-->00:18:44.624
reuse it if time moves
backwards. Um so that's the
case. I've also looked at some

00:18:44.624-->00:18:51.597
other implementations. I've got
some add ons to web sites and
things and then some of them do

00:18:51.597-->00:18:56.902
have it by default some
def..have no default and then on
the right, I've got common

00:18:56.902-->00:19:01.841
libraries available and in this
case se..only one of them
actually had the the reuse

00:19:04.477-->00:19:10.149
verification in it. The others
didn't even have that function
available they jus..just

00:19:10.149-->00:19:16.956
obviously assumed that time
moved forward. Um, yea. So when
you are looking at implementing

00:19:16.956-->00:19:22.128
time based one time passwords,
um, make sure there is a setting
for disabling reuse and make

00:19:22.128-->00:19:28.634
sure it's set not to allow reuse
or you can look at other to
factor off alternatives. Um,

00:19:28.634-->00:19:35.241
there's actually R2P which is
takes the counter plus the C to
give you the number. There's

00:19:35.241-->00:19:40.680
usually, which is currently what
I prefer if that's available and
also friends don't let friends

00:19:40.680-->00:19:45.684
use this unless it is 2FA. Um,
so I was also looking at what
some of the other things in

00:19:48.687-->00:19:53.692
limits that uses um time. Um, so
so because because pseudo which
allows you to escalade and run

00:19:55.828-->00:20:00.599
something as root and that will
prompt you for a password and
then if you try again in the

00:20:00.599-->00:20:05.204
next five or fifteen minutes it
won't prompt you again for the
password, so I thought, hey, can

00:20:05.204-->00:20:10.142
I pseudo let time run forward
roll time backwards and then can
I stroll right in? In this case

00:20:10.142-->00:20:17.049
pseudo didn't uh realize what
had happened and stopped it and
this is because instead of using

00:20:17.049-->00:20:21.754
wall clock time like the le pen
was using, pseudos looked at the
number of all these techs coming

00:20:21.754-->00:20:27.259
from the CPUs, so it's actually
know how much techs have passed,
therefore um I need to

00:20:27.259-->00:20:33.666
re..reauthenticate the user. Um,
Uptime works in a similar way so
I've considered using Uptime as

00:20:33.666-->00:20:39.572
an example here. So I've got a a
date initially on the seventh of
November. The service has been

00:20:39.572-->00:20:46.145
up for about four minutes. I
roll the server forward in time
awake and it realizes, hey, it's

00:20:46.145-->00:20:52.017
only now still been up for seven
minutes so it will mean three
minutes have passed between me

00:20:52.017-->00:20:57.490
doing those two snippets. Um,
forensics could get rather
interesting if you had a log

00:20:57.490-->00:21:02.428
consolidator that allowed you to
sort all your logs by time, um,
the logs might have the earliest

00:21:04.763-->00:21:09.201
log entries on the hacker
logging out then the hacker
doing a late hack and the most

00:21:09.201-->00:21:15.341
recent entries is the hacker
logging in and um, I know a
person may initially start from

00:21:15.341-->00:21:19.612
when they logged in instead of
looking forward to see what
happened they might literally

00:21:19.612-->00:21:24.617
actually look backwards to see
what happened in the past before
their initial log in. Um, also

00:21:27.219-->00:21:33.893
if there's not centralized
logging you could just with a
cron job move just a date moving

00:21:33.893-->00:21:39.732
backwards and forwards at random
and this might actually cause
the log rolling, log purging to

00:21:39.732-->00:21:44.637
happen on the server that, oh, a
weeks passed I better go on
purge and delete all the logs.

00:21:44.637-->00:21:49.642
Um, and a couple of weekends
ago, someone saw on twitter,
someone had mentioned that that

00:21:52.144-->00:21:57.149
sing uh stingray release one of
the stingray device release
notes that, um, that sometimes

00:21:59.218-->00:22:04.156
when an external GPS device
gives erroneous GPS text the
license for the stingray may

00:22:07.159-->00:22:12.164
fail, so, this, you know maybe
if you n.. [clapping] So maybe
if you're in a jurisdiction that

00:22:16.402-->00:22:21.407
allows GPS broadcasts and you
want to disable uh, stingray
device, maybe that's a method to

00:22:23.642-->00:22:28.647
try. Um, so what's of the NTP
servers and actually how how do
they work? Um, [inaudible] may

00:22:34.420-->00:22:39.425
often say a GPS aerial that
often looks like that. Um, and
so the these work in two ways.

00:22:42.795-->00:22:48.567
At the top you ought to have the
GPS antenna and a sw.. radio
down the cable down to your data

00:22:48.567-->00:22:54.540
down ,bleh. Sorry. Down to your
data rec and into the computer
and then actually inside the

00:22:54.540-->00:23:01.413
server you got you've got the
GPS receiver and that's directly
soldered onto the motherboard

00:23:01.413-->00:23:06.752
and the other option is you have
the GPS antenna and that's also
got the GPS receiver up on the

00:23:06.752-->00:23:13.626
roof and then it all sends
serial down through the building
down to the rec and into the GPS

00:23:13.626-->00:23:18.631
server and to use that you just
tell NTPD that you got a new
server 127 dot O dot 20 dot O

00:23:21.300-->00:23:26.305
and then they know NTPD goes,
oh, that's a GPS source, I'll
look at DFGPSO and DFPP it's

00:23:29.208-->00:23:34.213
zero and start doing the import
for time. Um, so the serial data
is the nima data rows. Um, the

00:23:38.117-->00:23:44.456
GPS funds start with dollar gp.
Uh, those are the two sort of
most common ones used sort of by

00:23:44.456-->00:23:50.195
NTPD for time and you'll see
there I've got a time component
and one of them also has a date

00:23:50.195-->00:23:55.334
component. And and and the
other, there's an additional
wire quite invol.. involved

00:23:55.334-->00:24:00.673
that's a pulse for second um
signal and what that means for
for the that point one of a

00:24:00.673-->00:24:05.744
second at the ver.. At the very
start of a second you'll go high
for point one of a second

00:24:05.744-->00:24:10.849
there'll be low for point nine
of a second and the pulse for a
second doesn't contain a time

00:24:10.849-->00:24:15.721
variant it only gives a very
accurate indicator where the
second starts. And the way the

00:24:15.721-->00:24:22.428
s..GPS receivers are built and
designed, um, the pulse per
second takes a much shorter path

00:24:22.428-->00:24:27.733
through the processing and has
little processing on it so it's
a much more accurate time sort

00:24:27.733-->00:24:33.105
of indicator and gives you sort
of micro and nano seeking
accuracy oppose to the nima data

00:24:33.105-->00:24:38.110
C which is maybe only a
millisecond accuracy. Um, so in
the setup I had here I initially

00:24:40.813-->00:24:46.952
just had NTPD running on
Raspberry Pi the GPS receiver
coming in through serial onto

00:24:46.952-->00:24:52.958
the GPR pens along with the
pulse per second along with
pulse per second. Um, so

00:24:52.958-->00:24:57.196
initially I start looking at can
I just spoof per pulse per
second it's nice and simple it

00:24:57.196-->00:25:01.767
just ties in highs and lows you
don't have to think too much so
I connected the pulse per second

00:25:01.767-->00:25:06.338
wire to another GPR pen on the
Raspberry Pi and I just had a
little scrap bit set the pen on

00:25:06.338-->00:25:11.343
the high and lows applicable.
Um, what I found out ha..what's
happening was, um, if you run

00:25:13.379-->00:25:19.017
the pen pulse per second sort of
faster or slower than any of the
nima data it would sort of keep

00:25:19.017-->00:25:25.224
correcting itself as it would
get the actual second number
from the nima data rows but just

00:25:25.224-->00:25:29.561
the start of that second might
be a little messed up. So
neither deviated more than a

00:25:29.561-->00:25:36.268
second and if you're in finance
or telecoms or energy where
fr..fractions of a seconds count

00:25:36.268-->00:25:41.273
it would be an important thing
and other industries where
seconds aren't that actual

00:25:41.273-->00:25:46.278
fractions of a second aren't
that important it's probably
much more least of an issue. Um,

00:25:46.278-->00:25:52.518
software....oh! Can I just
remove the serial data and will
it just rely solely on pulse per

00:25:52.518-->00:25:58.390
second? Pulling the wire, um, it
didn't it just stopped and it
even started to freak out in the

00:25:58.390-->00:26:03.896
pulse per second of that case
and so I did have to actually
start working on getting a full

00:26:03.896-->00:26:10.636
solution that did the nima data
and the pulse per second so I've
got another python script that

00:26:10.636-->00:26:15.641
will do that. Um, just like
tardgps it will move time
backwa.., um, slowly and in

00:26:18.077-->00:26:23.081
steps, so you can adjust the
time. Um, I found this, um,
simpler to use than tardgps

00:26:25.484-->00:26:30.055
because I wasn't having to deal
with GPS signals. I was only
worrying about serial data and

00:26:30.055-->00:26:35.227
it's a lot simpler to write
serial that it is trying to
integrate with other tools and

00:26:35.227-->00:26:40.232
involve radio and the timing
involved and that. Um, so the
script basically worked by

00:26:44.102-->00:26:49.575
writing some nima serial to
standard out, have a pulse per
second pen and going on high and

00:26:49.575-->00:26:55.781
low loop through that at
whatever rate you wanted a
second to be you socat to move

00:26:55.781-->00:27:01.487
the standard out to the
relevant, uh, virtual..virtual
console then sublink the virtual

00:27:01.487-->00:27:06.492
console to dev GPS zero NTPD top
the time from there. Um, it's uh
behaved just like tardgps

00:27:11.964-->00:27:17.769
simpler because I don't have to
involve the radio, though does
require physical access to the

00:27:17.769-->00:27:22.908
data sync to the roof to
actually splice into the wires
rather than attacking it

00:27:22.908-->00:27:27.913
remotely. So I went and got an
NTP server, um, this is a cheap
one um but the boss paid for.

00:27:30.782-->00:27:35.787
Um, on the website it says that
this company delivers NTP
solutions for things like

00:27:38.357-->00:27:44.496
airports and nuclear power
plants and yea, so this should
be good, right? Nuclear power

00:27:44.496-->00:27:49.501
plants. You got to keep those
safe. Um, so with tardgps and
Nima desync, um you know if I

00:27:53.505-->00:27:59.211
moved home forward in just one
big jump it just continued on
merrily. Um, if I moved time

00:27:59.211-->00:28:04.550
backwards in a big jump it
crashed like we saw in NTPD
before but tardgps and Nima

00:28:04.550-->00:28:09.421
desynced worked finer and I
could work backwards on it and
so it had no protections, um, in

00:28:09.421-->00:28:14.426
that regard. Um, yea, and then I
also had a look at the web u i,
found some bugs that's so simple

00:28:17.629-->00:28:22.634
and dumb I'm almost afraid to
actually mention them here. But,
um, found that, hey, there's,

00:28:28.106-->00:28:32.978
it's using gate for everything,
so even when you log in with a
password and then just puts the

00:28:32.978-->00:28:37.983
password up in the URL bar, um..
[laughter] Yea, and basically
because it's not using cookies

00:28:40.752-->00:28:45.757
at all so I I could just, later
navigate directly to the
relevant pages. Um, yea and you

00:28:48.727-->00:28:52.764
notice when you went to change
the pa..the first one was
changed in the network settings

00:28:52.764-->00:28:57.102
when you go to change the
password you actually at a
different password form. Um,this

00:28:57.102-->00:29:02.040
case, yea, password form and
when you reset the password,
again, the new passwords just in

00:29:04.910-->00:29:10.215
the gate. I don't I don't find
any posts in it. Um, having this
roll is really handy when you do

00:29:10.215-->00:29:14.753
go to change the password and
you come to the thing a month or
two later you don't forgot the

00:29:14.753-->00:29:21.460
password you just pull out the
URL and reset the password with
no, wi..without actually needing

00:29:21.460-->00:29:26.465
to know the password, so. Yea,
off by pass by not having any
off I suppose. [heavy breath]

00:29:33.472-->00:29:38.477
Um, so sort of, we've been
looking at someone attacking, um
how about we can look at maybe

00:29:38.477-->00:29:43.482
some detecting of uh GPS
spoofing. Um, have a little talk
of GPS Snitch and how that works

00:29:50.155-->00:29:55.160
is it looks at the time offsets
from.. And in this case if you
do have external time sources

00:29:57.195-->00:30:02.434
other than just GPS you could
look at whether the time you are
being getting from GPS defers

00:30:02.434-->00:30:06.171
from the time you are getting
from the NTP network. You can
also look at say the signal

00:30:06.171-->00:30:10.442
strengths because when a
satellite's directly over here
it's going to be stronger than

00:30:10.442-->00:30:15.747
when it's down at the horizon
because the distance is greater
and also the range of the signal

00:30:15.747-->00:30:18.817
strengths because you know
different strengths of the
satellites you should see a

00:30:18.817-->00:30:23.822
different range and the signal
and the signal strengths. Um,
and also if it's an NTP server

00:30:26.758-->00:30:32.264
the location should be
stationary. M...most people
don't have data centers that

00:30:32.264-->00:30:37.269
move much. And also one that I
haven't actually looked at is um
maybe looking actually at the

00:30:41.073-->00:30:45.844
direction of the signal because
if you're doing GPS spoofing,
chances are the signals are all

00:30:45.844-->00:30:51.316
going to be one direction when
when you are using GPS in the
real world the satellites are

00:30:51.316-->00:30:56.321
all around you. Um, so I got uh,
uh a little video of it all
running. Um, so what you see,

00:30:59.424-->00:31:03.161
let's take you through and
initially it's something that
you're going to do mornings. Um,

00:31:03.161-->00:31:07.699
this is because you want to
remove any false positives
because sometimes if a cloud

00:31:07.699-->00:31:13.205
goes past or other little things
like that the GPS signal will
change slightly and we don't

00:31:13.205-->00:31:19.111
want to alert every time a cloud
goes pass pass so we'll wait for
a particular number of failures

00:31:19.111-->00:31:23.381
and also more than just one type
of failure so by the end of it
that it's actually saying

00:31:23.381-->00:31:28.954
critical error there we go it's
actually saying it's critical
and it's detecting the error

00:31:28.954-->00:31:34.426
now. Although it's spoofing,
now. Um, yea, so that's
particularly helpful maybe if

00:31:34.426-->00:31:40.165
you're running GPS server if you
just stop looking at the GPS
location but you could also use

00:31:40.165-->00:31:45.170
another GPS receiver. Um, so,
how could we detect the Nima
Serial spoofing? So, this is uh

00:31:51.843-->00:31:56.848
and you two are just for defcon,
hopefully it's on GitHub. Um, if
my colleagues have woken up at

00:31:59.117-->00:32:05.023
nine A.M. on a Saturday morning
they should have made the
suppository public [laughs] so

00:32:05.023-->00:32:10.028
if not it should be public soon,
but it is there waiting to go.
Um, what this tool does it

00:32:12.030-->00:32:16.701
records as all the Nima
sentences is coming in it looks
at the time and it times stamps

00:32:16.701-->00:32:23.675
them all and it looks at the
ratios between the different
Nima sentence types and also how

00:32:23.675-->00:32:29.514
many sentences per seconds it
gets. So, just a little tie in
then, most of the sentences are

00:32:29.514-->00:32:34.519
coming in once per second. This
one there, that sort comes in
every point six of a second so

00:32:36.955-->00:32:42.694
if you start to see this the uh
the the sentence rate deviating
from one and sort of the ratio

00:32:42.694-->00:32:47.699
changing uh you know that
something's amiss in this case.
Um, and you know, when when it

00:32:50.969-->00:32:55.974
sees those different it will
alert for you. Um so you got
this tools to protect and detect

00:32:59.311-->00:33:04.249
this GPS spoofing. Some other
methods are is making sure you
have more than three upstream

00:33:06.318-->00:33:11.323
DTP servers a number of servers
I have reviewed and my day job
that only have one NTP server

00:33:13.792-->00:33:20.065
um, even better when they have
one NTP server configured and
that server is no longer

00:33:20.065-->00:33:25.070
actually working. Um, yea if you
got three uh you can detect the
bad tecker and you know which

00:33:27.339-->00:33:31.476
one is actually taking bad,
because you still have two
corresponding and also make sure

00:33:31.476-->00:33:38.116
you've got moldable types of up
strength. Um, don't rely just on
GPS. These all sort of atomic

00:33:38.116-->00:33:43.121
clocks, the NTP poll [crinkling
sound] and also don't pick one
upstream provider for you time

00:33:46.992-->00:33:53.231
outside your unit work because
you might have the rogue edmond
problem at the upstream who they

00:33:53.231-->00:34:00.105
can change all the times on the
air internet facing NT P service
and then all your time goes ary.

00:34:00.105-->00:34:06.678
Um, yea prot..they protect
that's a particularly common
case if you use a managed if

00:34:06.678-->00:34:12.083
you're if you're a customer of a
managed service provider and
they just provide their own time

00:34:12.083-->00:34:17.289
servers into your own network
you may be like to say hey could
we see sometime from outside

00:34:17.289-->00:34:22.294
we're not reliant solely on you
for time. Um, if you're on an
air gap network um and you saw a

00:34:26.498-->00:34:32.070
line on GPS well you're still
receiving some signals over the
air so are you still really in

00:34:32.070-->00:34:38.143
an air gap network? Um, have
been that case splash out get
some atomic clocks or some

00:34:38.143-->00:34:43.148
caesium or rubidium and yea do
it like the the national labs
that run the some of the central

00:34:46.084-->00:34:51.089
time servers around. Um, yea if
you're actually delving into
some NTPD or something uh, maybe

00:34:53.992-->00:35:00.665
look at implementing something
like GPS Snitch and Nima dsync.
Um make the logging a little bit

00:35:00.665-->00:35:05.670
more explicit when it is
shutting down because the time's
so different. Um, yea, so that's

00:35:07.872-->00:35:12.877
my talk. Um, thank you very
much. Um, thank you for coming.
