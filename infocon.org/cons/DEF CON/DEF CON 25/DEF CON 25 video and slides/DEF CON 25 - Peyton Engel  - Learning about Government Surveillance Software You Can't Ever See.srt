00:00:00.042-->00:00:04.958
>>So I wanted to start with uh
I'm gonna go kind of fast
because this is only a 20 talk

00:00:04.958-->00:00:09.042
and I uh uh it's action packed.
I wanted to start with the sort
of general presumption which is

00:00:09.042-->00:00:14.292
that it's frustrating when
p-technology.. There's not
transparency, it's not made

00:00:14.292-->00:00:19.542
public. And I'll, I'll start
with the example of breath
analyzers uh back in the mid

00:00:19.542-->00:00:25.083
2000's cops would be pulling
people over making them blow in
a tube, using that to make a

00:00:25.083-->00:00:28.917
decision as to whether or not to
make an arrest. And people
thought well what if there are

00:00:28.917-->00:00:32.625
problems with the breath
analyzer? Why should we trust
it? Why was there really

00:00:32.625-->00:00:36.333
probable cause for an arrest
here and indeed eventually some
enterprising people got their

00:00:36.333-->00:00:41.000
hands on the s-source code for
intoxilyzer and found out that
it did have some real problems.

00:00:41.000-->00:00:45.875
And and might y-yeild some false
positive results and anyone who
remembers the 80's will remember

00:00:45.875-->00:00:50.792
the clipper chip uh en-endeavor
when the government just said
'Hey I know what we'll do, we'll

00:00:50.792-->00:00:55.500
hold on to 1 true key for all
encryption and you guys can have
your own keys but we'll be able

00:00:55.500-->00:01:01.833
to just kinda backdoor that and
this is a a an idea with a a
just a built in fundamental flaw

00:01:01.833-->00:01:07.042
uh should be pretty obvious to
everyone here. But anytime you
hear just kind of trust us we

00:01:07.042-->00:01:12.625
know what we're doing, that's
what gets gets me riled up. And
so I'm gonna talk about is a

00:01:12.625-->00:01:18.083
series of tools that are are
more developed for for
servailing um peer to peer

00:01:18.083-->00:01:23.417
networks and they are not made
public and the government just
says just trust us we know what

00:01:23.417-->00:01:28.250
we're doing. And and because
they're not public I haven't
seen them I don't know anyone

00:01:28.250-->00:01:35.208
who has seen them unless they
are a sworn agent and they won't
talk to me about it. Uh and so

00:01:35.208-->00:01:39.250
the inferences that I'm gonna
show you here are made from just
reading dozens and dozens of

00:01:39.250-->00:01:42.708
search warrant affidavits when
they describe how the thing
works and what it does, so we

00:01:42.708-->00:01:45.417
can make some deductions about
what it actually what it
actually does, that's where

00:01:45.417-->00:01:51.333
we're headed. Um so surveillance
is fairly pervasive these days
um there's a law that says you

00:01:51.333-->00:01:56.333
probably shouldn't install an
untappable phone system um we've
got uh the NSA metadata call

00:01:58.750-->00:02:03.917
collection or call metadata
collection stuff where they we
realize the content uh analysis

00:02:03.917-->00:02:08.958
is fun but traffic analysis can
be just as fun. Uh and and
surveillance is also pretty

00:02:08.958-->00:02:14.042
secret we usually don't find out
about it until there is a leak
and everyone gets in the press

00:02:14.042-->00:02:19.750
and heads roll. And there's more
than just surveillance going on,
surveillance by surveillance I

00:02:19.750-->00:02:25.625
mean is just passive collection
of information but we see now
some more invasive uh efforts as

00:02:25.625-->00:02:30.125
well and there's a uh uh series
of cases right now that playpen
serious of cases which some

00:02:30.125-->00:02:35.708
people in the room are familiar
with were the government
embedded uh some malware that

00:02:35.708-->00:02:40.167
opened a side channel - people
would browse to a website using
TOR the government operated that

00:02:40.167-->00:02:45.417
website for awhile and implanted
some some malware that opened a
side channel and would leak the

00:02:45.417-->00:02:50.875
user's public IP address back
back to the government so uh
that's not just surveillance

00:02:50.875-->00:02:56.667
that's actually changing things
and and you might need a warrant
for that and some some cases are

00:02:56.667-->00:03:00.333
getting tossed for that reason
but by far not all. And we know
that the government is

00:03:00.333-->00:03:04.042
collecting exploits that's not
been a secret at all so one of
the questions that we have to

00:03:04.042-->00:03:08.875
ask ourselves is where is the
boundary between just good old
fashioned aggressive

00:03:08.875-->00:03:13.625
investigation of crime and
violating people's rights and
sort of taking things one step

00:03:13.625-->00:03:18.625
too far. So that's the prologue
let's get down to it. Um when I
s-s-s talk about peer to peer

00:03:20.667-->00:03:25.375
networks I mean things like
BitTorrent Gnutella Ares or
Edonkey or whatever they call

00:03:25.375-->00:03:31.250
it. These have been around for a
long time. Uh the new Gnutella
variant of the tool that I'm

00:03:31.250-->00:03:36.375
talking about was in use at
least as early as 2009 I don't
know if anyone really uses

00:03:36.375-->00:03:41.083
Gnutella anymore I'm sure the
tool still exists um and these
are generally the tools that I'm

00:03:41.083-->00:03:47.542
talking about are generally
forks of open source software,
so there's been a a a tool

00:03:47.542-->00:03:53.708
developed like micro torrent or
whatever or um Phex that's one
of the ones and some

00:03:53.708-->00:03:58.167
enterprising software developer
says I'm gonna make my own
version of this that does some

00:03:58.167-->00:04:03.375
extra stuff. So they they make
use of aspects of the
peer-to-peer protocol that are

00:04:03.375-->00:04:08.917
normally obscured from the user
they're they're below what the
user sees. And they add in some

00:04:08.917-->00:04:12.542
features that were not really of
interest to ordinary users and
we'll talk about what those are.

00:04:12.542-->00:04:19.292
So who develops these? Well one
guy the the the tool for the
Ares network was developed by

00:04:19.292-->00:04:24.500
this one person Joseph Versace,
he's a he's a Canadian law
enforcement uh programmer and

00:04:24.500-->00:04:28.875
analyst uh there's a there was a
collaboration between the CS
department at a couple of

00:04:28.875-->00:04:33.500
universities and some police
departments that produced a
roundup which is kind of the

00:04:33.500-->00:04:38.958
most best known of these tools
um and it's based on the the
Phex uh Gnutella client and

00:04:38.958-->00:04:45.208
there's a a version of it for
BitTorrent as well. So it
they're developed by a you know

00:04:45.208-->00:04:51.917
normal folks, academics and so
forth, and they make new uses of
existing features. So for

00:04:51.917-->00:04:57.000
Gnutella when you do a search
when you get a query hit it
comes back and it includes the

00:04:57.000-->00:05:02.000
SHA-1 hash value of the files
that the search hits are so this
is a nice quick easy way to

00:05:04.917-->00:05:11.250
identify if you happen to have a
database of files that you knew
nobody should possess uh you

00:05:11.250-->00:05:15.250
could just quick see, do these
hash values match?, and then you
would instantly have good

00:05:15.250-->00:05:22.042
targets for investigation um and
Gnutella also has a feature
called Swarming where if if I

00:05:22.042-->00:05:27.042
admit that I'm sharing a file I
will also try to tell you about
all the other people I know

00:05:27.042-->00:05:30.583
about that are sharing that
file. So that you can grab it
from multiple peers and it

00:05:30.583-->00:05:36.792
doesn't all have to come from me
and then you can directly uh
browse peers as well, not just

00:05:36.792-->00:05:41.083
do searches but once you've
found someone who's in Gnutella
client you can just go and query

00:05:41.083-->00:05:46.000
them and and get a list of uh
what files they have what
regardless whether your search

00:05:46.000-->00:05:50.458
turned up those files or not. So
that's those are, you know,
kinda interesting features if

00:05:50.458-->00:05:55.125
you are an investigator that's
kind of fun. Um on BitTorrent we
have a couple of other things

00:05:55.125-->00:06:00.875
that are what are called tracker
messages and this tells which
peers are interested in which

00:06:00.875-->00:06:05.125
torrents so if someone is
looking for something you might
be able to detect them on that

00:06:05.125-->00:06:11.167
basis um and when they connect
for downloads or when they
acquire new segments they'll uh

00:06:11.167-->00:06:15.833
uh um clients will send out some
announcements of what segments
of what they've got so they can

00:06:15.833-->00:06:22.208
immediately begin participating
and sharing. Remember the whole
idea of BitTorrent was that

00:06:22.208-->00:06:26.250
bandwidth is asymmetrical we can
upload, we can download things
way faster than we can upload

00:06:26.250-->00:06:31.542
them generally speaking, and so
we wanna share large files uh
what we'll do is everybody

00:06:31.542-->00:06:36.000
shares segments of the files or
you know you share the whole
file but we'll grab segments a

00:06:36.000-->00:06:39.333
segment from here and a segment
from there and a segment from
here and that means that we can

00:06:39.333-->00:06:43.917
download multiple things while
we're only uploading, you know,
whatever our up upstream

00:06:43.917-->00:06:47.542
bandwidth is. Uh and then
there's something called peer
exchange which is kind of like

00:06:47.542-->00:06:52.167
the swarming feature for
Gnutella so these are the
features that exploits on on

00:06:52.167-->00:06:57.917
BitTorrent and then we add in
some features as well. Um known
file lists, so a database of

00:06:57.917-->00:07:03.542
known files of interest so that
we can quickly determine when we
seize search query results

00:07:03.542-->00:07:09.625
whether they are things that we
want to be investigating. IP
Geolocation - are these doofuses

00:07:09.625-->00:07:14.792
in our jurisdiction? So before
we spend a whole lot of time
investigating something can we

00:07:14.792-->00:07:19.500
at least tell if we would have
the power of arrest over these
people. Uh Single-source

00:07:19.500-->00:07:24.500
downloading, this is uh we don't
wanna find out we don't want to
swear out a warrant and go and

00:07:26.667-->00:07:30.333
arouse someone out of bed and
seize their computer only to
find out that they only had the

00:07:30.333-->00:07:34.417
first 3 segments of an 80
segment torrent. Uh we wanna
know that they have the whole

00:07:34.417-->00:07:38.292
thing so that means we have to
download the whole file from
them so this is completely

00:07:38.292-->00:07:44.583
antithetical to what BitTorrent
is designed to do uh we're gonna
instead of grabbing things from

00:07:44.583-->00:07:48.083
all over the place we're gonna
grab them from just one thing
and that's so that's it's not

00:07:48.083-->00:07:53.458
really subversion of the
protocol but it uh a use other
than what it was designed for

00:07:53.458-->00:07:58.458
and then fake file share also uh
we'll get throttled if we're not
sharing anything. Uh and if we

00:08:00.708-->00:08:05.333
share the right kinds of things
we might attract people into
connecting to us.. Am I doing

00:08:05.333-->00:08:11.958
something funny with the mic or
is.. Okay I'm okay? Alright!
[laughter] Um so we we we we we

00:08:11.958-->00:08:16.250
don't wanna actually be
distributing contraband so we're
not going to actually do that

00:08:16.250-->00:08:19.750
but we're gonna announce that we
have it to share to see who will
connect to us and so also so

00:08:19.750-->00:08:23.958
that we don't get throttled. Uh
so that it looks like we're
sharing and we don't get um

00:08:23.958-->00:08:29.875
taken out of the out of the
network. Finally we'll have the
ability to tag individual

00:08:29.875-->00:08:34.292
clients that we connect to. And
that's there's gonna be more on
that later but that's a pretty

00:08:34.292-->00:08:40.250
interesting thing. Can I
identify some point down the
road that this was the, you

00:08:40.250-->00:08:45.542
know, the client that connected
to you know that I connected to
and downloaded from. That'd be

00:08:45.542-->00:08:50.792
that'd be an important piece of
evidence. Uh and we'll talk a
little bit about how that works.

00:08:50.792-->00:08:55.792
Um so what they're gonna do,
these tools, is impersonate
regular old peers on the

00:08:57.875-->00:09:03.375
network. They're gonna engage in
activity design to attract
connections whether they're

00:09:03.375-->00:09:09.708
doing searches uh or or um
announcing what they've got uh
they'll do queries of their own

00:09:09.708-->00:09:15.250
to find things of interest
they'll inspect the systems that
they connect to to look at as

00:09:15.250-->00:09:21.000
much as they can in the shared
areas. They'll perform those
single source downloads and they

00:09:21.000-->00:09:26.417
log their activity and this is
the game plan, right? We'll
we'll the investigators will go

00:09:26.417-->00:09:31.208
make themselves a a good log of
what they did and what they
found and they'll use that as

00:09:31.208-->00:09:36.208
the basis for obtaining a
warrant. Alright so um if you
were accused of a crime on the

00:09:39.000-->00:09:45.708
basis of a log file - you might
like to know is that log file a
reliable source of information.

00:09:45.708-->00:09:52.083
Does it work? Uh and so people
over time attorneys have tried
to get their hands on these

00:09:52.083-->00:09:58.167
tools because they wanna know
how does it work? What does it
do? And they're uniformly

00:09:58.167-->00:10:03.750
rebuffed uh nobody's to my
knowledge ever succeeded in that
quest. And there have been times

00:10:03.750-->00:10:09.083
where the court has ordered the
court has sided with the defense
attorney and said yeah, um law

00:10:09.083-->00:10:12.750
enforcement cough up, cough up
this code or give them access to
a working instance of it or

00:10:12.750-->00:10:17.750
something. And uh the case will
get dropped so they'd rather do
that then burn their source and

00:10:21.250-->00:10:26.583
this is a curious thing because
on the one hand they say there's
nothing interesting about these

00:10:26.583-->00:10:31.083
tools. They're just simple forks
of regular open source software
uh anyone could make this it's

00:10:31.083-->00:10:36.542
not a big secret and yet they'll
go to great lengths to preserve
the secrecy. And reason number 1

00:10:36.542-->00:10:41.542
that they give is it would
divulge our database of you know
naughty files. Uh and and first

00:10:43.667-->00:10:48.667
off I think the software
developers in the room just
snickered because who embeds a

00:10:48.667-->00:10:52.042
database in the software that
they're distributing, it should
be two separate things so that

00:10:52.042-->00:10:57.000
you can update the database
without having to distribute a
whole new build of the code. So

00:10:57.000-->00:11:02.167
it's probably not exactly that.
I don't think the database is
literally part of the software

00:11:02.167-->00:11:07.333
but the reason that they give is
that if we do this everyone who
wants to trade illegal materials

00:11:07.333-->00:11:12.375
would just go and flip one bit
in them and then all of our hash
values wouldn't be uh any good

00:11:12.375-->00:11:17.542
anymore and while that's true it
works it's a two way street it
wouldn't be any good for the

00:11:17.542-->00:11:22.500
people who are sharing either
because they'd not they would
not know if you were out on the

00:11:22.500-->00:11:26.125
internet and everybody, you
know, claimed to have different
files if the hash values, didn't

00:11:26.125-->00:11:30.708
match how would you know you
were getting segments of the
same file? So that reason is a

00:11:30.708-->00:11:35.708
little bit shaky to me. Um but
even if everyone did flip bits
in their files that would be so

00:11:39.000-->00:11:43.208
disruptive to the trade of
contraband maybe you'd want that
result anyway. Okay, the code

00:11:43.208-->00:11:49.958
must remain secret reason number
2. It would disclose the
undercover investigators and

00:11:49.958-->00:11:54.542
here I think they're speaking
kind of metaphorically. The the
the metaphor that they use is

00:11:54.542-->00:12:00.625
well, you know, if we had um
someone buried deep undercover
in a drug cartel we would use

00:12:00.625-->00:12:05.750
information that they gave us
and that's okay there's nothing
wrong with that we wouldn't

00:12:05.750-->00:12:11.375
identify that person unless and
until we absolutely had to. Um
well this isn't quite like that

00:12:11.375-->00:12:17.792
I don't think uh but it but it's
interesting. So I can think of
two possibilities and they both

00:12:17.792-->00:12:24.250
revolve around the idea that we
don't want one law enforcement
inadvertently targeting agents

00:12:24.250-->00:12:28.083
of another law enforcement
agency going out on the on the
networking and seeing that these

00:12:28.083-->00:12:34.125
guys announced their sharing all
of this stuff let's go pick on
them. So possibility number 1 is

00:12:34.125-->00:12:38.917
that nodes know about one
another there's some either
central database or a list

00:12:38.917-->00:12:44.083
that's published of who's using
this software and that that way
you can identify your friend on

00:12:44.083-->00:12:49.083
the network and you don't go and
and pick on them. Um this also
is probably not part of the

00:12:49.083-->00:12:53.500
software itself but maybe the
software contains the the means
of obtaining that list or

00:12:53.500-->00:12:59.833
something. and that list really
should remain secret we that
that's a legitimate secret. Um

00:12:59.833-->00:13:03.917
but I I don't think that's it
because from time to time they
will give you the log file and

00:13:03.917-->00:13:09.125
that contains their IP address
in it so that that doesn't make
a lot of sense so the other

00:13:09.125-->00:13:14.292
possibility is there's something
distinctive in the way the tool
does its initial handshake so

00:13:14.292-->00:13:19.292
when the when the when the two
peers connect, when two peers
connect, they'll exchange some

00:13:19.292-->00:13:23.958
information usually uh it'll
have a globally unique ID or
something like that that it

00:13:23.958-->00:13:28.375
exchanges and there might be
something unique in that
handshake that would identify

00:13:28.375-->00:13:33.375
this as a non traditional uh
peer to peer client. And I think
that's a pretty likely guess.

00:13:35.917-->00:13:41.125
And I'll talk a little bit more
about that because this is how
the tagging feature works.

00:13:41.125-->00:13:47.375
Alright so we have some problems
with not being able to look at
this software and one of them is

00:13:47.375-->00:13:53.833
just the reliability of the
software. Does it ever
erroneously make a report? Well

00:13:53.833-->00:13:59.375
it's quite common I can tell you
from my own experience
consulting with attorneys it's

00:13:59.375-->00:14:03.792
quite common that investigators
when they go and they seize a
computer they don't find the

00:14:03.792-->00:14:08.167
files that they say they
downloaded from that computer
that happens well over half the

00:14:08.167-->00:14:13.833
time. There are two explanations
for this possible uh one is the
files weren't there in the first

00:14:13.833-->00:14:19.250
place and the report is wrong
and the second is um they don't
usually execute their warrants

00:14:19.250-->00:14:23.542
until months after they did the
initial download so the files is
not there anymore uh and that

00:14:23.542-->00:14:28.542
that's probably pretty likely
but uh what we don't know is how
many warrants have they obtained

00:14:33.250-->00:14:39.208
and executed that didn't result
in an arrest. We don't see
those, that's stuff that never

00:14:39.208-->00:14:43.417
makes it across and attorney's
desk. And so we don't know so we
don't know if there are false

00:14:43.417-->00:14:47.875
positives, we don't know it's
the the tool's false positive
rate and that I think is a

00:14:47.875-->00:14:53.083
worrisome thing. And the are
there conditions under which it
malfunctions? Well I'm here to

00:14:53.083-->00:14:56.875
tell you that software has bugs
and um I mean we wouldn't even
have this conference if that

00:14:56.875-->00:15:03.750
weren't true. [laughter] He's
shocked! This is the first he's
heard of it! I can't imagine why

00:15:03.750-->00:15:09.667
should think this particular
software has less bugs than any
other. And it might be useful to

00:15:09.667-->00:15:14.042
know what they are and there's
been no review of this um the
government just says yeah it

00:15:14.042-->00:15:19.042
works. The next problem is the
standard for obtaining a
warrant. In order to obtain a

00:15:21.208-->00:15:26.208
warrant you're supposed to
establish probable cause that a
crime might be committed. And

00:15:28.750-->00:15:32.792
this isn't technology by
definition this isn't technology
that's in the hands of the

00:15:32.792-->00:15:38.292
public there's a really
interesting case from the turn
of this century. Killo or Kyllo

00:15:38.292-->00:15:42.917
I'm not sure which it is vs
United States where the uh the
feds used a forward looking

00:15:42.917-->00:15:49.667
infrared radar to visualize what
was going on inside of a house
and the the supreme court said

00:15:49.667-->00:15:54.792
you needed to get a search
warrant for that you can't just
uh you can't just do this, this

00:15:54.792-->00:16:00.292
is stuff that's outside of what
the public could could have they
can't this it violates their

00:16:00.292-->00:16:06.042
reasonable expectation of
privacy. Um and I think that's
the case here too. That nobody

00:16:06.042-->00:16:10.333
thinks that there's a tool out
there that does this and it's
not in our hands we can't

00:16:10.333-->00:16:14.708
examine it, we can't see it. Um
and again this is where the
government tries to tell us that

00:16:14.708-->00:16:18.250
well this is just modified opens
for software, any user could do
the same thing. Well that's

00:16:18.250-->00:16:24.083
farcical, maybe any software
developer could. But most users
are not those. But it sort of

00:16:24.083-->00:16:28.833
raises the the supplementary
question how would we know we
were doing the same thing? If we

00:16:28.833-->00:16:33.333
can't see the tool to begin
with? Yeah maybe we could,
right? Maybe we could write any

00:16:33.333-->00:16:37.708
kind of software but how would
we know it works the same way
that the government one does? Um

00:16:37.708-->00:16:44.000
and that brings us also to
tagging. Right now there are
when you're using these tools

00:16:44.000-->00:16:47.625
there are shared areas on your
computer so folders full of
things that you're willing to

00:16:47.625-->00:16:50.250
share on the peer to peer
network and then there's the
rest of your computer which is

00:16:50.250-->00:16:55.250
supposedly off limits. When, the
way that tagging works is in
that initial handshake, the the

00:16:58.500-->00:17:03.875
law enforcement software will
submit a blob of data that's
gonna get written to a log file

00:17:03.875-->00:17:08.625
in in Gnutella that's the client
dot net file. The list of
clients that the thing is

00:17:08.625-->00:17:13.542
connected. That's not in a
shared area of the computer and
it contains now a blob of data

00:17:13.542-->00:17:17.417
that the government wrote and
when later they come and look
through the log they'll say Yep

00:17:17.417-->00:17:23.292
this is the one we wrote, it's
encrypted with our our our key.
Uh so is that something you

00:17:23.292-->00:17:28.958
should have to get a warrant
for? I don't know ah that's a
unlitigated um question right

00:17:28.958-->00:17:35.958
now - or there's been litigation
but we haven't gotten a sensible
result. Uh the next thing is

00:17:35.958-->00:17:40.708
what are the chances you're
gonna find a judge who's able to
tell if these statements are

00:17:40.708-->00:17:45.125
reliable that how IP addresses
can be connected to subscriber
identity how peer to peer

00:17:45.125-->00:17:49.417
networks work um how a
government tool based on open
source software works. Judges

00:17:49.417-->00:17:54.667
don't know this. They just get a
20 page warrant affidavit and
they say "Ah, okay! Sign" Uh

00:17:54.667-->00:17:59.917
[laughter] cause they don't have
a choice it's it's that or
conduct a really serious

00:17:59.917-->00:18:05.417
investigation of their own and
it's not gonna happen. Another
thing is who's qualified to

00:18:05.417-->00:18:10.542
testify about how these tools
work in court? You usually see
the investigator who operated

00:18:10.542-->00:18:14.583
the software come and say this
is what I did on this such and
suchin night. But that person

00:18:14.583-->00:18:19.292
can't really explain, he's that
person is trained in how to use
the tool but doesn't necessarily

00:18:19.292-->00:18:24.583
know the inner functioning, you
know, the the that the developer
of the tool would know. Um so I

00:18:24.583-->00:18:28.417
I think testimony ought to
require more than just knowledge
about which button you click to

00:18:28.417-->00:18:34.500
make the single search download
happen. And then of course again
software ha-having bugs it might

00:18:34.500-->00:18:41.500
be exploitable ah to an a really
enterprising person. Um you know
the-these things we know,

00:18:41.500-->00:18:45.750
there's java based stuff,
there's dot net based stuff,
there's you know the the the

00:18:45.750-->00:18:50.750
clients that the the tools are
derived from any bugs that those
have this probably has two. Um

00:18:53.750-->00:18:58.750
and it may have it's own bugs
too of course. And and one of
the things that we've got here

00:18:58.750-->00:19:02.917
is the exploitation would
probably go undetected because
of this lack of transparency

00:19:02.917-->00:19:07.083
that we've got and because it's
mostly not used by security
professionals it's mostly used

00:19:07.083-->00:19:11.458
by investigators, and they might
just not even notice if they're
software crashes in a funny way

00:19:11.458-->00:19:18.292
one day. . Alright I have I
think about one minute left, ah
I would uh uh yep okay I have

00:19:18.292-->00:19:24.708
one? One. Ah So I could do like
a question if somebody's got
one. [pause] No? Alright well

00:19:24.708-->00:19:29.708
thank you very much and thanks
for coming to my talk!
[applause] See you again, soon!

00:19:33.625-->00:19:34.750
[applause]
