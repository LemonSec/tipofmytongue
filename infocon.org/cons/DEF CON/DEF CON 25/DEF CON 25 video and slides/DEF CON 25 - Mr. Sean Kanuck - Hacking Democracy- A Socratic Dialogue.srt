00:00:00.042-->00:00:05.292
>>First off as you know I am a
noob this is my first time
speaking and also my first time

00:00:05.292-->00:00:10.292
to Def Con. [whoops from
audience] So I wanna say thank
you very much to this community

00:00:12.667-->00:00:16.958
for inviting me to share a
little time with you and to
explore what I think is a really

00:00:16.958-->00:00:22.750
fascinating and timely topic. As
you can tell from the programs
and I hope you know where you

00:00:22.750-->00:00:27.750
are, uh my name is Sean Kanuck
for 5 years from 2011 to 2016 I
was the United States First

00:00:31.667-->00:00:38.000
National Intelligence Officer
for Cyber Issues. I was charged
with leading strategic analysis

00:00:38.000-->00:00:42.833
including attribution
assessments for a lot of the
cyber breaches that happened

00:00:42.833-->00:00:48.667
during that period. As you can
probably guess I'm quite happy
to not be doing that anymore and

00:00:48.667-->00:00:53.667
I have great empathy and respect
for my successor. [laughs from
audience] [applause] But if

00:01:00.708-->00:01:07.000
you're familiar with the US
government's attribution of the
Sony Pictures Entertainment hack

00:01:07.000-->00:01:12.667
or Las Vegas Sands hack and a
lot of those events that
happened in years past, that

00:01:12.667-->00:01:17.458
would have been what my office
was leading the intelligence
community on. So I obviously

00:01:17.458-->00:01:21.875
come at this from a strategic
perspective I imagine most of
you or many of you in this

00:01:21.875-->00:01:27.875
audience are much more
technically skilled than I am,
much better at tactically

00:01:27.875-->00:01:33.250
hacking things. I will tell you
my role as an international
attorney and as a professional

00:01:33.250-->00:01:39.042
intelligence analyst was to look
at where the greatest
vulnerabilities are and where

00:01:39.042-->00:01:44.875
the greatest impact could be
acheived through intelligence
and military operations.

00:01:44.875-->00:01:50.375
Sometimes helping with strategic
targeting in my nation's
national security defense and

00:01:50.375-->00:01:57.000
often looking to prevent those
kind of things happening to my
nation, our allied nations and

00:01:57.000-->00:02:01.458
quite frankly, almost any nation
in the world's critical
infrastructure from being harmed

00:02:01.458-->00:02:07.333
and brought down. That's a
little bit about me only to tell
you where I'm coming from. When

00:02:07.333-->00:02:13.250
I think about systems I think a
little the way you all do. I
look at them as the mischief

00:02:13.250-->00:02:18.958
maker, of how could I harm this?
Not as an engineer who builds
them 'cause I haven't built

00:02:18.958-->00:02:24.083
systems and I've never
administered a system. But what
I have done is look at Al Qaeda

00:02:24.083-->00:02:30.250
financial networks, foreign
information technology systems
and say "Where is the weak

00:02:30.250-->00:02:35.958
point? How could this be
exploited?" And then make a real
effort to make sure that US

00:02:35.958-->00:02:42.250
systems and hardware and
software that the whole world
relies upon is protecting itself

00:02:42.250-->00:02:47.250
for our common interest. So let
me start with 5 questions. This
isn't the real Socratic part

00:02:49.458-->00:02:55.833
this is just a little in
general. Raise your hand if you
think there's anything such as a

00:02:55.833-->00:03:00.833
secure IT system. [laughter from
crowd] Raise your hand if you
think there's anything such as

00:03:03.417-->00:03:08.417
an air gapped network? Raise
your hand if you believe James
Clapper and Jeh Johnson that

00:03:12.958-->00:03:17.958
Russian government entities were
behind the DNC hack in f- 2016?
Raise your hand if you believe

00:03:22.833-->00:03:29.500
Vladimir Putin that the Russian
government had nothing to do
with that. [mumbling and

00:03:29.500-->00:03:33.417
laughter audience] Ok now I
assume we have a very
geographically disparate

00:03:33.417-->00:03:38.417
audience here so raise your hand
if you believe whatever country
you come from hasn't done

00:03:40.500-->00:03:45.500
similar things or wouldn't do
similar things if they could.
[audience laughs] Alright I like

00:03:47.750-->00:03:52.750
the laughter 'cause I think it
means we're on the same page.
[laughter] I try to think like

00:03:56.208-->00:04:02.042
an offender in order to improve
defense. I'm gonna start here
with a few minutes of where I

00:04:02.042-->00:04:07.792
come on a strategic trend
analysis and then I have 16
questions I wanna do an exchange

00:04:07.792-->00:04:12.792
with you all on about hacking
democracy. So just so you know
where I'm coming from. I don't

00:04:15.417-->00:04:19.875
think there's any such thing as
a secure system. Particularly
when you allow for not only

00:04:19.875-->00:04:26.042
remote hacking but supply chain
operations where either the
vendor willingly sells you

00:04:26.042-->00:04:30.625
something that has added
features, or where a 3rd party
could have manipulated the

00:04:30.625-->00:04:35.625
manufacturing or transportation
process to the end user. I think
insider threats remain one of

00:04:38.083-->00:04:42.750
the greatest concerns for both
government and, well government,
military, and corporate

00:04:42.750-->00:04:47.917
environments. And that includes
both stupid and malicious
people, those are all insider

00:04:47.917-->00:04:52.917
threats. And I think when you
have the ability to use dirty
tricks the way intelligent

00:04:55.583-->00:05:00.583
services do, the way criminal
syndicates do, and the way
terrorists do, you really have

00:05:02.833-->00:05:09.375
to expand your thinking. Give
you one quick example years ago
I gave a NATO secret level

00:05:09.375-->00:05:15.917
speech in Europe and at the end
of it a Hungarian secret service
officer asked me "Mr. Kanuck

00:05:15.917-->00:05:19.500
what's the highest level of
encryption that the national
security agency can decrypt

00:05:19.500-->00:05:25.958
today?" [crowd laughs] So at
that time I didn't actually know
the answer so I told him "Sir I

00:05:25.958-->00:05:32.375
respect your question but I
don't know the answer. Secondly,
if I did I probably wouldn't be

00:05:32.375-->00:05:38.083
able to tell you at a NATO
secret level. And third, how
good is the lock on your

00:05:38.083-->00:05:44.958
upstairs back window?" Do you
think we're gonna use a cray
server farm in Maryland to get

00:05:44.958-->00:05:49.667
one person's password? If I'm a
criminal I'm gonna beat you up
in the alley and get it or

00:05:49.667-->00:05:55.958
kidnap a family member. If I'm
an intel service, I'm gonna be
providing you the cell tower

00:05:55.958-->00:06:02.792
you're using or the other links
you're using, or I'm gonna be
filming you doing it. Or finding

00:06:02.792-->00:06:07.083
out from one of your peers or
from your assistant. So expand
your thinking that's why I'm

00:06:07.083-->00:06:11.792
really excited to talk to this
audience about democracy,
because I've been doing a lot of

00:06:11.792-->00:06:17.167
research on this topic in the
last year ever since CNN, ABC,
NBC all started calling me in

00:06:17.167-->00:06:20.542
the fall. I was out of
government so when the
government says "We can't

00:06:20.542-->00:06:25.167
discuss that ongoing
investigation" or "That's
classified we can't discuss that

00:06:25.167-->00:06:29.083
with you now." The first thing
the media does is call the
people who used to be in that

00:06:29.083-->00:06:34.250
job, and hoping that they can
now talk. But that got me
thinking. I put on my hat and I

00:06:34.250-->00:06:39.250
said "If I were actually trying
to undermine democracy how would
I think about going about it?"

00:06:42.875-->00:06:49.583
Just like on September 13, 2001
a friend of mine at CIA and I
wrote an unrequested paper

00:06:49.583-->00:06:55.458
called "What we would have done
with 4 airplanes." All due
respect to the 3-->000 lives we

00:06:55.458-->00:06:59.875
lost that day, and the property
damage, but if you understand
the infrastructures of the

00:06:59.875-->00:07:05.208
United States' financial system
and government system 4
explosions of that size could

00:07:05.208-->00:07:10.208
have caused much more death, and
much more destabilizing
disruption. So what are the

00:07:12.292-->00:07:16.125
other assesment things I
believe? I believe we have
convergence and devices,

00:07:16.125-->00:07:23.000
protocols and infrastructure
networks such that we're having
many more single points of

00:07:23.000-->00:07:28.583
failure. I participated in a
Lloyd's of London insurance
report that was just aired about

00:07:28.583-->00:07:35.208
a week ago. And one of the
scenarios was where a common
hypervisor software upon which

00:07:35.208-->00:07:40.750
multiple cloud service providers
rely was compromised. It was a
hypothetical scenario but you

00:07:40.750-->00:07:47.000
think you have uh resiliency in
your infrastructures or in your
products and in many cases you

00:07:47.000-->00:07:51.375
don't because of the
efficiencies of scale we're
looking for. This is most easily

00:07:51.375-->00:07:56.000
demonstrated in the fact that
the government and military have
very few dedicated networks

00:07:56.000-->00:08:00.792
anymore. And the ones they do
have have l- very limited
bandwidth compared to the

00:08:00.792-->00:08:05.583
civilian fiber optic
infrastructure and undersea
cables. So I think about where

00:08:05.583-->00:08:11.208
the strategic nodes and the
tipping points. I think the
threat is accelerating, both in

00:08:11.208-->00:08:16.917
offense's capability over
defense. I think defense is
improving but I actually think

00:08:16.917-->00:08:22.417
the gap is still increasing
because offense is increasing at
even a faster rate. Part of that

00:08:22.417-->00:08:27.500
is due to the exponential
increase in the threat surface
area with the internet of things

00:08:27.500-->00:08:33.083
and a lot of other aspects. If
you read the world wide threat
assessments to congress each

00:08:33.083-->00:08:37.042
year that the director of
national intelligence gives,
which I highly recommend you do,

00:08:37.042-->00:08:43.625
they're awesome open source uh
and every well cited
occasionally resources. Uh I

00:08:43.625-->00:08:48.417
believe that integrity of
information is going to
supersede confidentiality and

00:08:48.417-->00:08:54.708
availability as the most
significant vector and format of
attack of concern. And most

00:08:54.708-->00:09:00.833
importantly and most relevant to
this discussion is I think the
fundamental distinction between

00:09:00.833-->00:09:06.417
how the United States, Western
Europe and some other
democracies think about cyber

00:09:06.417-->00:09:11.625
security is fundamentally
different the way other nations
do. We think about it as

00:09:11.625-->00:09:17.583
critical infrastructure
protection protecting the
systems and the pipes. Russia,

00:09:17.583-->00:09:22.375
China, some of the Gulf
countries and others think about
the content, the information uh-

00:09:22.375-->00:09:27.375
flow through it. We talk about
cyber security, they talk about
information warfare, influence

00:09:30.042-->00:09:35.375
operations, psychological
operations and perception
management. And that's what I

00:09:35.375-->00:09:40.375
wanna focus on here today. I've
sworn an oath twice to protect
the constitution of the United

00:09:42.958-->00:09:46.500
States and the form of
government it represents from
foreign and domestic adversaries

00:09:52.750-->00:09:56.917
[applause] OK that's actually
something I wasn't expecting so
I'm gonna say thank you very

00:09:56.917-->00:10:01.500
much because there are other
people on stage at Def Con
occasionally, there are people

00:10:01.500-->00:10:06.292
out in war zones, who dedicate
and risk their lives. I mean
I've done some fun stuff but I

00:10:06.292-->00:10:10.583
know the people the men and
women who actually put their
lives on the line to make sure

00:10:10.583-->00:10:14.833
we can have something like Def
Con. Ok [audience applauds] I'm
the guy who stands up and says

00:10:14.833-->00:10:19.833
"I love the fact that code pink
was able to yell at a director
of central intelligence nominee

00:10:23.333-->00:10:28.333
in the US capitol." I know of no
other country where that hearing
would have been occurred

00:10:31.250-->00:10:36.417
televised, open to the public
and the people who swore at him
to his face would have gone home

00:10:36.417-->00:10:41.375
to sleep in their own bed. So
I've spent 16 years of my life
to protect the right to do this

00:10:41.375-->00:10:45.833
and I thank you for recognizing
that, for all the people who
have also done that. So thank

00:10:45.833-->00:10:50.833
you and kudos to the rest of
them. [applause] Alright after
that heartfelt comment let's g-

00:10:56.792-->00:11:01.792
have some fun. When I think
strategically about how to mess
up a democracy I start with sort

00:11:05.958-->00:11:10.958
of a 4 grid. I have direct
intervention and indirect-
indirect intervention and overt

00:11:13.042-->00:11:18.042
and covert. What's an example of
those? Direct intervention in an
overt way: not letting people

00:11:23.917-->00:11:28.458
get to the polls. We saw this
during the Civil Rights movement
in the US where folks weren't

00:11:28.458-->00:11:32.500
actually allowed to vote even
though they were entitled to.
We've seen this in other

00:11:32.500-->00:11:37.500
countries like the Canadian 2011
election which ended up being a
s- a very significant court case

00:11:40.042-->00:11:45.042
in their system where one party
got the voter support list from
the other party and very shortly

00:11:47.292-->00:11:52.500
before the election sent them
all robocalls telling them the
polling station had been moved.

00:11:52.500-->00:11:55.417
Kind of fun I tip my hat to
that, that's good, but that's
not what you want in a

00:11:55.417-->00:12:02.000
democracy. Direct intervention
that's covert, easiest example
of this is the ruling party

00:12:02.000-->00:12:06.833
stuffing ballot boxes or
changing results. You can find
great historical examples of

00:12:06.833-->00:12:11.833
that going all the way back to
Napoleon Bonaparte. Indirect
influence but overt. What does

00:12:15.333-->00:12:21.458
that look like? I think of
President Obama's speech in
London against Brexit. Public

00:12:21.458-->00:12:26.458
speech, invited, but he's not a
voter in the UK. Not even a
constituent or a candidate. Yet

00:12:28.500-->00:12:35.208
his foreign voice was invited to
influence that election. And of
course the obvious one on the

00:12:35.208-->00:12:40.750
indirect influence coovert side
is something like what we saw in
the US and French presidential

00:12:40.750-->00:12:45.750
elections recently. So how 'bout
the systems themselves? When I
think of voting systems and

00:12:48.375-->00:12:54.167
information resources to me they
take on public and private
aspects and in a s- open society

00:12:54.167-->00:12:59.333
like ours we entrust a lot of
our democratic institutions, and
that's small D, nothing I'm

00:12:59.333-->00:13:05.083
gonna say is gonna be party
specific or lambasting either
party here. Small d democratic

00:13:05.083-->00:13:11.958
institutions so the governments,
the state governments, operate
the polling stations. But who

00:13:11.958-->00:13:17.833
creates the voting machine
software and hardware? Is that
the federal government? Is that

00:13:17.833-->00:13:21.583
the state government? No. You
have a wonderful voting village
here where you're all getting a

00:13:21.583-->00:13:26.625
chance to hack those machines,
right? I think that's awesome.
[audience member whoops] On the

00:13:26.625-->00:13:32.208
information resources side we
can see a lot of governments who
have state news channels, TV and

00:13:32.208-->00:13:37.208
radio. You also have a lot of
private resources. Historically
that's been newspapers and radio

00:13:40.125-->00:13:45.708
stations, now you have social
media and all kinds of other
platforms. Gets very tricky when

00:13:45.708-->00:13:49.042
you start asking "How do you
wanna regulate or protect
things?" As we're gonna see in a

00:13:49.042-->00:13:54.042
few minutes. Lastly I think
about intentional messaging and
unwitting exploitation that's

00:13:57.208-->00:14:02.208
either meant to inform or
deceive. And this is nothing new
in the history of politics. You

00:14:04.583-->00:14:09.833
can go back to Thucydides's
Peloponnesian war and can see
the Athenians trying to convince

00:14:09.833-->00:14:14.833
the Melians to give up their
city without a fight. That's on
the direct lobbying. On the

00:14:18.125-->00:14:22.292
misleading and misperceiving if
you understand the history
behind the nomenclature of

00:14:22.292-->00:14:28.500
Iceland and Greenland or
Bolshevik and Menshevik. The
Bolsheviks were not the majority

00:14:28.500-->00:14:33.958
faction but they adopted that
name. And if you think this only
happens in foreign countries, go

00:14:33.958-->00:14:38.792
read the history of the words
"federalist" and
"antifederalist". Unwitting

00:14:38.792-->00:14:44.583
exploitation in more recent
times. Think about Twitter that
had been used as a platform for

00:14:44.583-->00:14:50.417
terrorist incitement speech.
That company took active
measures to start preventing

00:14:50.417-->00:14:56.667
some of those us incitements to
violence on it's own platform.
They weren't involved in it but

00:14:56.667-->00:15:02.708
it was uh- using their platform.
And then of course we have
issues about fake news and a

00:15:02.708-->00:15:07.708
good example in 2011, 13 was the
Syrian Electronic Army's hack of
the Associated Press uh Twitter

00:15:13.208-->00:15:18.208
account to put out a fake
statement that there had been a
bomb at the white house. And I

00:15:18.208-->00:15:22.708
hope some of you are familiar
with this. For a lot of people
the story ended with the fact

00:15:22.708-->00:15:28.333
that the I think it was about
140 point drop in the Dow Jones
for 5 minutes. Most people were

00:15:28.333-->00:15:33.208
comforted to hear that that
value came back into the
financial marketplace. People

00:15:33.208-->00:15:37.125
like me who are worried about
continuity of government and
public confidence in critical

00:15:37.125-->00:15:42.458
infrastructures asked "Did the
money go back into the same
accounts?" And the answer is

00:15:42.458-->00:15:47.542
absolutely not. That was a
multi-billion dollar
redistributive economic event

00:15:47.542-->00:15:53.917
because someone put out a false
tweet. Can any of those stock
trades be reversed? Are you

00:15:53.917-->00:15:59.083
allowed to make a dumb stock
trade based on inaccurate
information? Are you allowed to

00:15:59.083-->00:16:04.292
pick your own information
sources? Absolutely. The crime
there was the crime of hacking

00:16:04.292-->00:16:09.292
the account. The stock trades
were legal. So with that brief
overview of how I view this

00:16:12.708-->00:16:19.708
space and with underscoring the
fact that for me, our very
competent competitors in

00:16:19.708-->00:16:23.375
cyberspace and I'm gonna speak
as an American 'cause I am one.
But I think a lot of the

00:16:23.375-->00:16:27.875
statements I'm gonna make are
fairly universal. And yes I'm
also not ignorant and naive to

00:16:27.875-->00:16:32.542
the fact that the majority of
spam in the world comes through
US gateways. And that there's

00:16:32.542-->00:16:38.125
plenty of criminal activities
stemming from the United States.
At the same time, my career has

00:16:38.125-->00:16:43.542
been focused on foreign and
external threats so that's my
point of relevance. Er. I think

00:16:43.542-->00:16:47.875
some of our very sophisticated
adversaries along with some of
our partners and allies are

00:16:47.875-->00:16:52.750
involved in a daily process of
intelligence collection against
each other. That's something

00:16:52.750-->00:16:57.208
that's not even prescribed under
international law 'cause it's
accepted to be the second oldest

00:16:57.208-->00:17:02.333
profession and something you'll
never get rid of. The question
becomes when is it too much and

00:17:02.333-->00:17:09.333
when does it cross lines? And
that's what I wanna focus on
here. How do we get that first

00:17:09.333-->00:17:14.333
slide up? What? >>[inaudible off
mic] >>Oh play it out ok. So the
first one is and I apologise my

00:17:24.125-->00:17:29.625
slide deck is literally just 16
questions in really bold print.
So to start our Socratic

00:17:29.625-->00:17:36.583
dialogue. >>[inaudible off mic]
>>Yeah. How do you know your
vote was recorded correctly? And

00:17:36.583-->00:17:42.542
this is where we can start with.
>>Yeah that's fine >>So. Someone
from the audience, please offer

00:17:42.542-->00:17:46.292
a thought. How would you know if
your vote was recorded
correctly. I vote in Alexandria,

00:17:46.292-->00:17:51.625
Virginia. I filled in a paper
ballot, I put it into a machine
that electronically recorded it

00:17:51.625-->00:17:55.500
and it said "You vote has been
recorded!" And I got a little
green icon. It didn't even tell

00:17:55.500-->00:18:00.250
me who it was recorded for. Not
that I would believe the name
that came up on a monitor. How

00:18:00.250-->00:18:06.250
would I know my vote is recorded
properly? >>Blockchain!
>>Blockchain! OK. [sporadic

00:18:06.250-->00:18:10.458
applause] How many electoral
systems are currently using
blockchain for that? >>[unclear

00:18:10.458-->00:18:15.292
shouting from audience] None!
>>You all know that Estonia has
had 3 presidential elections

00:18:15.292-->00:18:20.292
completely online already right?
How far before the US would have
a complete online election for

00:18:22.667-->00:18:27.667
president. >>[crowd tittering]
Never! >>[laughing] Second
question. What's more important

00:18:34.042-->00:18:39.042
to you: secrecy or verification?
>>[crowd murmuring] Verification
>>So I'm clearly talking and I

00:18:43.375-->00:18:48.458
did hear a couple secrecies but
most is verification. I could go
to most people's social media

00:18:48.458-->00:18:55.000
websites and probably guess with
99 percent who they're gonna
vote for. If you go back decades

00:18:55.000-->00:19:01.083
or centuries the idea of a
secret ballot was a critical
aspect of democracy in its

00:19:01.083-->00:19:07.542
evolution. Fear of the
governmental authorities, fear
of your neighbors, your spouses

00:19:07.542-->00:19:11.958
I mean this is why adults over
18 go into the voting booth
alone in the United States.

00:19:11.958-->00:19:16.000
There are countries where they
don't. I've gone in and watched
someone vote in a foreign

00:19:16.000-->00:19:21.000
country in a way that I never
could in the United States. And
when I think about this in the

00:19:23.375-->00:19:28.208
sense of mutually exclusive
options and blockchain may be a
solution to give us our cake and

00:19:28.208-->00:19:34.500
eat it too, but if you wanted to
p- be able to really know how
your vote was recorded, should

00:19:34.500-->00:19:40.417
you be allowed to opt in to a
system where you can check the
voter database and how your vote

00:19:40.417-->00:19:47.042
was recorded? How many of you
would prefer that opt-in option
to verify your own vote even if

00:19:47.042-->00:19:52.292
it meant giving up a secret
ballot? >>Hell no. >>I hear hell
no. And I don't know if you can

00:19:52.292-->00:19:55.708
all see, I've got lights shining
in my face, but I'd say it was
about a third of the hands that

00:19:55.708-->00:20:00.833
went up. >>[Audience murmuring
responses] I'd love to sell my
vote so yeah, that's great.

00:20:00.833-->00:20:05.333
>>[laughs][audience laughs]
That's good! What secondary
market do we then t- create

00:20:05.333-->00:20:11.208
there? No those are really
important things to consider. So
what's the solution that gives

00:20:11.208-->00:20:17.042
us our cake and eat it too?
Blackchain? >>[unclear audience
response] >>Gimme another one.

00:20:17.042-->00:20:21.792
>>[unclear audience response]
>>[laughs] The answer was there
are more options and it would

00:20:21.792-->00:20:26.792
take too long to explain. That's
fine. No I respect that, uh. My
next question to you all: How

00:20:30.083-->00:20:35.083
much error is too much for
legitimacy? I personally don't
think the exact vote count I see

00:20:38.542-->00:20:43.542
rec- recorded and publicized
that goes down to the singles
digit in a multimillion dollar

00:20:43.542-->00:20:48.875
number is perfectly accurate. If
you believe that vote counting
is a science I'll simply remind

00:20:48.875-->00:20:55.042
you of the 2011 election and
hanging chads. Where we had
Cuban and Chinese governments

00:20:55.042-->00:21:00.458
offer to send election monitors
to Florida to help us with our
democracy. True story, true

00:21:00.458-->00:21:05.458
story! I I think that's great on
their part. If you talk to an
economist he or she would tell

00:21:09.500-->00:21:14.500
you you don't want to live in a
society with zero crime.
Actually getting that graph all

00:21:16.667-->00:21:21.833
the way to zero, to the limit,
the marginal value of return and
the expense it costs to get

00:21:21.833-->00:21:26.667
there is too much. All of us
would need 2 policemen walking
around us all the time. We've

00:21:26.667-->00:21:31.083
seen some models where it wasn't
2 to 1, it was probably 1 to 5,
that was known as the Soviet

00:21:31.083-->00:21:36.083
Union and most of us don't think
that was a great way to go
through life. So what percentage

00:21:38.667-->00:21:43.667
of error, statistical error in a
US presidential election, do you
think is acceptable that you

00:21:47.417-->00:21:53.000
wouldn't question the
legitimacy. Let's hear some
numbers. >>One tenth of one

00:21:53.000-->00:21:59.833
percent! >>One tenth of one
percent. >>Less than the margin.
>>Less than the margin.

00:21:59.833-->00:22:04.375
>>[unclear audience response]
>>Wh- [laughs] someone doesn't
like first past the post voting.

00:22:04.375-->00:22:09.375
Okay. So now you're familiar
with 2 standard deviations, the
standard that's used in science

00:22:12.000-->00:22:18.292
for certainty levels and for the
FDA to approve drugs? Well some
of you probably take drugs with

00:22:18.292-->00:22:23.750
no FDA approval [laughs]
[audience laughs] but those of
you who stick to lawful

00:22:23.750-->00:22:29.792
prescriptions. Uh that's a 5
percent margin of error in those
studies. You're putting toxins

00:22:29.792-->00:22:35.417
into your body with a 5 percent
uncertainty and you expect one
tenth of one percent, at least

00:22:35.417-->00:22:40.417
someone said that. We have a
very low tolerance. Do we want
to get to zero? And is it cost

00:22:42.958-->00:22:49.625
effective and feasible to get to
zero? Who wants to get to
completely verified zero

00:22:49.625-->00:22:54.625
statistical error in voting?
>>If we don't know the cost, we
can't answer that. >>We don't

00:22:56.875-->00:23:01.375
know the cost, so we can't
answer the question. That's a
great answer. You know if you

00:23:01.375-->00:23:05.875
spend time in government you
realize a lot of good academic
and business questions just

00:23:05.875-->00:23:11.250
become crazy complicated when
you're in the fiduciary duty of
spending taxpayer money on

00:23:11.250-->00:23:15.167
questions of uncertainty. So I
really like that answer and
unfortunately I don't have a

00:23:15.167-->00:23:18.792
great response to you on what
this system would cost. But I
hope it's something we're all

00:23:18.792-->00:23:22.458
thinking about I hope it's
something the election
commissions are thinking about

00:23:22.458-->00:23:26.250
and I hope it's things that
groups like Verified Voting and
others are thinking about to get

00:23:26.250-->00:23:31.250
us to that least level of error.
So that's the election day and
your actual vote tabulation.

00:23:33.250-->00:23:40.167
What does it take before you get
to the voting booth? The next
question I have for you is: Were

00:23:40.167-->00:23:45.167
you on the right list? Are you a
registered voter? Who holds
those databases? Can they be

00:23:47.833-->00:23:52.833
hacked and manipulated? What do
you think? Voter registration
lists, secure? >>No >>How much

00:23:59.458-->00:24:03.417
error do you want to accept in
your voter registration lists?
You all seem like it's they're

00:24:03.417-->00:24:09.083
compromised or they're
compromisable, and then you
laughed about it. What if I told

00:24:09.083-->00:24:13.792
you a specific ethnic group was
the one getting excluded from
that voter registration list by

00:24:13.792-->00:24:18.333
a hate group who was able to
hack it? I'm not the least bit
comfortable about that and I'm

00:24:18.333-->00:24:23.333
not gonna laugh about that. So
who's helping secure those? Do
we want the federal government

00:24:26.667-->00:24:31.833
involved? Or do we want that
only at the state level? That
public policy discussion is

00:24:31.833-->00:24:36.833
going on right now. >>[unclear
audience response] >>More
inclusive rather than less. I

00:24:39.042-->00:24:44.042
like that answer uh personally.
>>[unclear audience response]
>>Register everyone by default.

00:24:48.000-->00:24:52.542
Why bother with a list?
>>[unclear audience response]
>>What? [audience laughs] I

00:24:52.542-->00:24:58.292
missed that. >>[unclear audience
response] >>Oh what do you mean
by everyone? Well based on the

00:24:58.292-->00:25:02.833
constitution that would be
people of all races and genders
and race over the age of 18

00:25:02.833-->00:25:07.708
that's where we've currently set
the bar. >>[unclear audience
response] >>Oh there are- true

00:25:07.708-->00:25:12.833
there, so we heard "not felons"
which means there are some
people who temporarily or

00:25:12.833-->00:25:17.833
indefinitely lose their voting
rights. >>[unclear audience
response] >>Is it not my

00:25:19.917-->00:25:24.500
constitutional right to go play
baseball on voting day? Isn't
that what freedom's about?

00:25:27.292-->00:25:32.292
[hollers from crowd] 2 great
successes of the Soviet Union:
near perfect literacy much

00:25:35.000-->00:25:41.833
better than the current US rate,
and almost perfect voter
turnout. [crowd laughs] The

00:25:41.833-->00:25:46.583
third one is the beauty of their
subway stations in Moscow,
beautiful crystal chandeliers

00:25:46.583-->00:25:53.375
and mosaics on the walls. Ok.
Were you on the list? How about
the next question, were you in

00:25:53.375-->00:25:58.542
the right place on voting day? I
already gave you the example of
the deception in the Canadian

00:25:58.542-->00:26:04.292
election, what other things can
happen? And when you think about
being on the list and being in

00:26:04.292-->00:26:11.000
the right place to actually
exercise your suffrage, do the
policies in place

00:26:11.000-->00:26:17.375
disproportionately impact
certain groups. >>[audience
responding] Yes. >>I hear

00:26:17.375-->00:26:23.250
absentee voting and I hear a lot
of yeses. And one of my great
concerns is, so I'm an analyst I

00:26:23.250-->00:26:27.583
don't think anything is a
hundred percent certain which
means I believe there will be

00:26:27.583-->00:26:32.292
some statistical error in any
system. I think if you get it to
that one tenth of one percent or

00:26:32.292-->00:26:36.917
something incredibly low, that
then we're doing well and you're
not gonna have a crisis in

00:26:36.917-->00:26:41.917
legitimacy. At the same time I
want that to be random error. I
don't want that to be error that

00:26:45.500-->00:26:50.500
disproportionately affects
people in a specific district,
because they are in a low income

00:26:50.500-->00:26:55.500
area and their county can't buy
the best machines. [audience
members clap] I don't want it to

00:26:57.500-->00:27:02.625
disadvantage in a visual audit
process, I don't want it to
disadvantage visually impaired

00:27:02.625-->00:27:07.083
or people with other
disabilities. So while I'm
willing to stomach a little bit

00:27:07.083-->00:27:12.083
of statistical error I want it
to be purely random and not
harming any specific group in my

00:27:15.375-->00:27:22.208
electorate. To me that's a
really important criteria. >>Do
you know anything about uh,

00:27:22.208-->00:27:28.083
India's voting system? >>Do I
know anything about India's
voting system? I know India is

00:27:28.083-->00:27:32.833
the largest democracy and I know
India has the world's largest
biometric database, which so the

00:27:32.833-->00:27:37.083
government is using for things.
But I get the sense you have a
specific question or comment so

00:27:37.083-->00:27:42.542
please say it really loud and if
you don't yell loud enough I'll
repeat it. >>So uh >>Turn, turn

00:27:42.542-->00:27:48.958
around and yell. Come here. Come
here. Come here. Get up here,
expert. [audience laughs] Tell

00:27:48.958-->00:27:55.083
us all about it. >>Now, now I've
gotta try to throw out my
youtube knowledge. Uh so in

00:27:55.083-->00:28:01.542
India they have it setup where
there has to be a voting poll I
think it's like 2 miles within

00:28:01.542-->00:28:06.375
every person and uh there's
actually a Buddhist temple that
is out in the middle of nowhere

00:28:06.375-->00:28:11.750
where there's only one guy there
and they have to go there every
year and set up a booth just for

00:28:11.750-->00:28:16.542
him. >>Love it >>So... >>[from
crowd] How much does that cost?
>>How much- how much does it

00:28:16.542-->00:28:21.542
cost? But how much does freedom
cost? Like how much, right?
[crowd cheers] >>Alright so

00:28:27.583-->00:28:32.167
let's stay on India w- for one
second because I actually do do
a lot of work on cyber issues

00:28:32.167-->00:28:36.625
with India just not specifically
their voting system in fact I'll
be co chairing their

00:28:36.625-->00:28:42.333
international cyber conference
with an Indian think tank in
October. And to just put things

00:28:42.333-->00:28:47.917
in perspective about how you can
manipulate populations. One of
the problems they have in a very

00:28:47.917-->00:28:52.917
ethnically linguistic and
religiously diverse society are
some internism, competitions and

00:28:56.125-->00:29:00.708
unfortunately violence among
different political and
religious groups. A few years

00:29:00.708-->00:29:07.000
back there was actually fake SMS
message- substance in SMS
messages and social media that

00:29:07.000-->00:29:13.708
went viral about attacks on a
certain religious and ethnic
group in the northeast. Who a

00:29:13.708-->00:29:18.750
lot of those family members were
working in the west and the
south and sending money home to

00:29:18.750-->00:29:25.542
their families. This is very
common in developing countries.
Those threats of violence caused

00:29:25.542-->00:29:30.542
a mass migration of millions of
Indian citizens to head back to
the northeast to protect their

00:29:32.708-->00:29:37.708
families. You think about the
impact of modern technologies of
real and fake news and

00:29:40.542-->00:29:45.542
platforms, someone sitting in
their basement could cause
millions of people to migrate

00:29:48.625-->00:29:53.542
thinking their families were at
risk of death. I'm not picking
on India there, this is an

00:29:53.542-->00:29:57.708
example that actually happened
there, I think this could happen
in a lot of places and these are

00:29:57.708-->00:30:02.500
some of the issues that Modi's
government and others in India
are thinking about a lot and

00:30:02.500-->00:30:06.125
countries like Bangladesh and
Pakistan and other neighboring
countries are also worries

00:30:06.125-->00:30:11.167
about. So I welcome the comment
about how India is dealing with
some of that, and you know let's

00:30:11.167-->00:30:15.833
think about Estonia let's think
about India, let's even think
about our British friends when

00:30:15.833-->00:30:20.833
we think about elections and how
the different systems play out.
Um shifting gears a little. We

00:30:23.583-->00:30:26.750
talked about how you get on the
lists and how you get to the
voting booth, let's go further

00:30:26.750-->00:30:33.583
back. Let's pretend we're in
campaign season. Who decides
what becomes news? >>[unclear

00:30:33.583-->00:30:39.833

heard me. [chuckles] who else?
>>[unclear audience response]

laughs] You're dating yourself.
[more laughter] >>[unclear

00:30:52.292-->00:30:57.417
government! [laughs] >>
[audience laughter] [unclear
audience response] >>Is "the

00:30:57.417-->00:31:02.792
government" the same people you
congratulated for risking their
lives to protect you 20 minutes

00:31:02.792-->00:31:07.792
ago? [chuckles] [audience
laughs/groans] Uh lots of
sources. Ok. We live in a multi

00:31:10.250-->00:31:15.792
uh various society where a lot
of different entities can weigh
in and do it but think about the

00:31:15.792-->00:31:21.667
process. Is it a blog post on
reddit that ends up getting
picked up and is it someone's

00:31:21.667-->00:31:27.292
tweet that goes viral? How-
>>[unclear audience response]
>>Robots on social media. We're

00:31:27.292-->00:31:32.292
gonna get to that. No we really
will. Uh. Next question. And now
my now my phraseology to the

00:31:36.750-->00:31:40.792
questions starts to get cheeky,
so as I say 'em, try to figure
out the real substance I'm

00:31:40.792-->00:31:45.792
getting at. Which runner is in
the lead? Why would that matter
to me for democracy? And of

00:31:48.500-->00:31:54.417
course runner is a euphemism.
Which candidate is actually
leading. There are actually

00:31:54.417-->00:31:58.708
people who vote based on what
they see happening in the polls.
Either because they wanna be on

00:31:58.708-->00:32:04.292
the winning team or because- you
laugh at that, there are people
who actually in many democracies

00:32:04.292-->00:32:09.500
who actually want to feel like
they're with and supporting the
group that's gonna be in power.

00:32:09.500-->00:32:14.042
But more importantly you have a
lot of cases especially in a
country where I'm not forced to

00:32:14.042-->00:32:19.167
vote if I want to play baseball,
I may wait to look at the polls
to decide if it's worth those 3

00:32:19.167-->00:32:25.667
hours of my time. If my
candidate is so far behind in a
district where I live, maybe I

00:32:25.667-->00:32:32.167
think it's useless to vote. So
think about hacking polls if
that can have an indirect

00:32:32.167-->00:32:37.250
effect. So name some polling
organizations for me,
nongovernmental, of course.

00:32:37.250-->00:32:41.208
>>[unclear audience response]
>>Yell at each other, I'm not
gonna repeat 'em all, but you've

00:32:41.208-->00:32:47.917
all heard of some of these,
right? And what's their IT
security like? Do they have any

00:32:47.917-->00:32:53.417
insight or threats? Or people
with political agendas working
in those companies? What IT

00:32:53.417-->00:32:59.417
hardware and software do they
rely on? Remember I'm the
annoying intel guy, if I can't

00:32:59.417-->00:33:06.000
get into your federal reserve
bank, if I'm an Iranian person
who is mad at the US, maybe I

00:33:06.000-->00:33:10.667
will DDoS all your commercial
and investment banks instead
'cause it'll create economic

00:33:10.667-->00:33:15.792
harm. If I'm in China and I'm
tryin' to steal intellectual
property and I can't get into

00:33:15.792-->00:33:20.792
the pharmaceutical company or
the defense contractor, or the
Australian mining company, maybe

00:33:22.958-->00:33:27.167
I know that their auditors,
their legal representatives and
their financial consultants have

00:33:27.167-->00:33:33.458
that same information. Tons of
law firms in the US and the UK
have been cyber attacked to get

00:33:33.458-->00:33:40.292
their clients information.
>>Panama papers! >>Panama
papers. Thank you. So do you

00:33:40.292-->00:33:44.750
think people would be willing to
try to hack polls if they
thought it could have an effect?

00:33:44.750-->00:33:48.417
So just like I don't know if my
vote is recorded properly, how
much faith should I put in the

00:33:48.417-->00:33:54.833
fact that candidate A is 5
points ahead. I think that would
be great to pretend that you had

00:33:54.833-->00:33:59.833
no reason to go vote in order to
deter you voting in a very close
race. >>[unclear audience

00:34:01.875-->00:34:08.583
response] >>Isn't this because
of the spoiler effect because we
use a first past the post voting

00:34:08.583-->00:34:14.458
system? We could spend all of
your conference discussing the
merits of first past the post

00:34:14.458-->00:34:18.333
constituencies, parliamentary
systems and all the other
variants that various countries

00:34:18.333-->00:34:22.792
use or that we've used in the
past. I just want to acknowledge
the importance of the question

00:34:22.792-->00:34:27.875
you asked and refer everyone to
political science textbooks
because how you do your

00:34:27.875-->00:34:33.583
elections, primaries to general
and all kinds of things matter.
If you want a really simple

00:34:33.583-->00:34:38.208
example compare the US system to
the French system where they
have multiple rounds of voting

00:34:38.208-->00:34:44.000
for president. OK. So it's a
good point but I'm not going to
go into it in full detail 'cause

00:34:44.000-->00:34:50.458
I probably wouldn't be able to
fully answer that properly
anyway. Next cheeky question. We

00:34:50.458-->00:34:55.458
asked which runner is leading on
the field, is the field made of
natural grass or astro turf?

00:34:58.792-->00:35:04.292
[audience laughs] That goes to
our botnet question. OK. What is
a grassroots movement today and

00:35:04.292-->00:35:09.292
how the hell do I know if it's
real people or how many of them
there are? >>You don't! >>You

00:35:13.708-->00:35:17.292
don't! [audience chuckles] And
what's our problem there?
Hopefully some of you are like

00:35:17.292-->00:35:23.083
"Well, that may not be bad if
it's a little bit, but at what
level does it become

00:35:23.083-->00:35:27.458
unacceptable?" And we're gonna
come back to that question in a
second. So we I think we all

00:35:27.458-->00:35:32.458
need to accept that what you
see... >>Ten. >> Ok ten minutes
left. What we see may or may not

00:35:36.208-->00:35:41.208
be real individual activity.
>>Does it matter the scale?
>>Does it matter the scale?

00:35:44.333-->00:35:49.875
>>Local grassroots level
elections for example like for
city council versus senator?

00:35:49.875-->00:35:53.500
>>My answer would be: how big is
the data pool and what's the
statistical level of error,

00:35:53.500-->00:36:00.042
right? What is the amount of
error or risk you're willing to
accept. Uh I'm gonna jump a

00:36:00.042-->00:36:03.708
little bit ahead here 'cause I
think it's relevant to this
discussion so. On the

00:36:03.708-->00:36:09.542
astroturfing question, for me it
actually quickly degenerates
into a competition between 2

00:36:09.542-->00:36:14.750
core values. Freedom of speech
and equality. And we see this
tension when we talk about

00:36:14.750-->00:36:20.417
campaign finance. We have put
limits on what specific
individuals and entities are

00:36:20.417-->00:36:24.917
allowed to donate or do as far
as spending money. We want
people to be able to have a

00:36:24.917-->00:36:30.375
disproportionate influence based
on spending money in campaigns,
but only up to a point. This

00:36:30.375-->00:36:35.875
speaks to your question ma'm. So
when it comes to sharing
information right, cause what's

00:36:35.875-->00:36:41.125
the money used for? The money is
used for TV ads. But what if I
can get the same publicity by

00:36:41.125-->00:36:46.125
doing social media. Should I as
one person be able to have the
influence of 5 million on social

00:36:48.708-->00:36:55.125
media, when I'm d- not allowed
to have the right to do that in
an economic sense in donating? I

00:36:55.125-->00:36:58.083
don't have the answer for this
but I think we need to start
thinking about it in those

00:36:58.083-->00:37:03.083
contexts. We want equality, one
person one vote, we accept
inequality in the campaign

00:37:05.208-->00:37:11.250
process but only up to a limit.
And who should decide what that
limit is? Should it be uniform

00:37:11.250-->00:37:15.083
over the United States of
America or your respective
countries? Or should it be

00:37:15.083-->00:37:20.083
county by county, polling
station by polling station, or
state by state? Do we want to

00:37:24.542-->00:37:29.542
invite foreign guests to our
party? >>NO! >>[laughs] >>F**k
no! >>We live we want to live in

00:37:34.375-->00:37:39.375
an open information space, we
don't want foreign governments
bankrolling specific campaigns.

00:37:44.333-->00:37:49.333
UK invited Obama to weigh in on
Brexit. Should we be inviting
President Xi to weigh in on the

00:37:52.083-->00:37:57.083
interim election? Or President
Putin? >>[unclear audience
response] >>Hu- hold on. The

00:37:59.625-->00:38:03.042
gentleman who was yelling one
more time, there's no difference
between public influence and...

00:38:03.042-->00:38:08.792
>>No there's a big difference. A
public speech by Obama is
totally different than a foreign

00:38:08.792-->00:38:13.250
power having thousands of
Twitter bots. >>I agree with
you. For me that's the

00:38:13.250-->00:38:17.167
distinction I gave in the
beginning between the covert and
the overt. Be- in my next

00:38:17.167-->00:38:20.958
question which I sh- remind me
to give you something later as a
plant, because that's the

00:38:20.958-->00:38:25.958
perfect segue. Are we inviting
foreign guests to our party? And
is it a masquerade ball?

00:38:29.625-->00:38:35.417
[audience laughs] Right? And
then, is it just the foreigners
who come wearing masks, or is it

00:38:35.417-->00:38:40.417
all kinds of interest groups? I
mean one of the saddest examples
that I remember for a while was

00:38:40.417-->00:38:45.083
in some of the unfortunate human
rights turmoils in the middle
east I think this was in Syria

00:38:45.083-->00:38:50.667
there was a large uh online
following for a very sad story
regarding a persecuted and

00:38:50.667-->00:38:55.667
oppressed Syrian lesbian. Turned
out it was a 50 year old man in
Iowa, I believe. Is that the

00:38:59.500-->00:39:05.500
kind of world we want to be
living in? I don't know. But do
I wanna let someone else be the

00:39:05.500-->00:39:10.208
sensor who decides what free
speech is and is not allowed
online? This get's us to the

00:39:10.208-->00:39:15.208
classic game theory question of
who guards the guardians? Ok and
that'll bring me into the next

00:39:18.750-->00:39:25.500
few questions I have. Which
innocent victims deserve
protection? Last time I checked

00:39:25.500-->00:39:32.000
the DNC is a private
organization. Does it deserve
taxpayer money protection to

00:39:32.000-->00:39:38.250
secure its networks? Yes or no?
>>[audience answers mostly "no"]
>>I was not expecting that

00:39:38.250-->00:39:44.000
uniform answer. I know that we
regulate party activities your
state legislators regulate the

00:39:44.000-->00:39:50.583
primary process to determine
those private organizations'
preferred candidate. So we do

00:39:50.583-->00:39:55.458
regulate it somewhat and we do
spend some taxpayer money there.
I did here a little yes over

00:39:55.458-->00:40:00.458
there so it wasn't unanimous but
so I ask the question: which
victims are entitled to state

00:40:05.750-->00:40:10.250
funded support and protecting
their systems, but that comes
with a very close second

00:40:10.250-->00:40:15.250
question: which entities are
required to accept that help?
Including if it means from the

00:40:18.167-->00:40:23.167
opposing political party that's
currently in office. What do you
think about that? >>Ask the

00:40:27.167-->00:40:29.625
Clinton body count. [audience
whoops, laughs, and groans]
>>[laughs] Ask the Clinton body

00:40:29.625-->00:40:35.000
count. So clearly we have recent
reference points. As a strategic
forecaster I'm always looking

00:40:35.000-->00:40:39.208
forward. I don't think we're
gonna be able to fix our system
before the midterms and maybe

00:40:39.208-->00:40:45.625
not even by 2020 but I sure hope
we can get our act together a
little better by 2024 and I hope

00:40:45.625-->00:40:51.500
we can start setting some good
examples. And again I'm very
nonpartisan, um by law I was not

00:40:51.500-->00:40:56.208
allowed to even participate in a
lot of political activities
beyond just merely voting while

00:40:56.208-->00:41:01.458
I was in the intelligence
community. And part of that
ensured the value and the um

00:41:01.458-->00:41:06.208
analytic authority of our team's
work when we went to brief
congress or the white house on

00:41:06.208-->00:41:11.542
things. So I respect that there
are partisan motivations behind
some of this but for me I use

00:41:11.542-->00:41:16.250
them as examples, because what
happens to one group today or
this year can happen to the

00:41:16.250-->00:41:20.833
other group or even a 3rd, 4th,
and 5th party if we ever get a
viable system with more than 2

00:41:20.833-->00:41:27.167
parties. >>[inaudible comment
from audience member] >>Not so
much the New York FBI? >>Right

00:41:27.167-->00:41:32.167
>>Tell me a little more
>>Partisan. Conspiring with Rudy
Giuliani. >>Ah! We have a

00:41:34.458-->00:41:39.458
comment that the New York FBI is
conspiratorial with Giuliani.
Just repeating it in case you

00:41:41.625-->00:41:46.625
didn't hear it. Ok. [audience
chuckles] Ok last 2 questions.
The problem with the elections

00:41:51.417-->00:41:57.708
and hacking democracy and undue
influence from foreign entities.
Is there actually anything new

00:41:57.708-->00:42:04.500
about this? >>[mixed audience
response] >>Citizens United is
mentioned. So if I'm sitting in

00:42:04.500-->00:42:11.417
the p- If I'm sitting in
parliament in 1775 in London how
do you think I characterize the

00:42:11.417-->00:42:16.583
pamphlets that Sam Adams and
Thomas Paine are cranking out?
Do you think that's terrorist

00:42:16.583-->00:42:21.417
activity inciting violence
against the legitimate
government authorities? >>Yes.

00:42:21.417-->00:42:27.458
Yes. >>How 'bout if I write a
bunch of political papers, sign
them in another name that

00:42:27.458-->00:42:32.458
suggests that I have much more
support than I really do.
Federalist Papers, Publius.

00:42:34.875-->00:42:39.875
Madison, Hamilton. The issues
we're dealing with are not new.
The question becomes: why does

00:42:42.208-->00:42:48.750
this matter and why is it so
offensive today? Ok the scope
and sophistication. And we heard

00:42:48.750-->00:42:53.000
that a little earlier a variant
of that from a lady over here,
and I agree with you. It's the

00:42:53.000-->00:42:59.208
question between qualitative and
quantitative change. If you
heard former NSA and CIA

00:42:59.208-->00:43:04.208
director Michael Hayden or
former director of national
intelligence Jim Clapper say

00:43:04.208-->00:43:07.583
that the Office of Personnel
Management hack that stole a
bunch of government employee

00:43:07.583-->00:43:12.833
data was a legitimate
intelligence target but that
they still want to prevent it,

00:43:12.833-->00:43:17.833
because it was so devastating.
How 'bout the release of
accurate documents, stolen

00:43:21.417-->00:43:26.417
documents, but accurate. Is it
really wrong to share truth? So
if we allow espionage and we

00:43:29.583-->00:43:35.583
believe that free information
society and truth is desirable,
those are 2 rights, how do 2

00:43:35.583-->00:43:41.750
rights make a wrong? And I think
it goes to that scale and scope.
It goes to the nearly costless

00:43:41.750-->00:43:48.042
ness level with which an entity
even 1 or 2 people somewhere
else in the world can have a

00:43:48.042-->00:43:54.333
hugely disproportionate impact.
Without running the risk of
actually running off the

00:43:54.333-->00:43:58.125
printing press and hand
delivering the pieces, without
entering the physical

00:43:58.125-->00:44:03.125
jurisdiction of those locations.
>>Isn't this why we need
intelligent voters? >>Isn't this

00:44:06.167-->00:44:10.208
why we need intelligent voters?
[sporadic applause] I believe in
voter education I unfortunately

00:44:10.208-->00:44:15.708
am also terribly aware that
education is not perfectly
consistent across our society

00:44:15.708-->00:44:20.417
and I don't want to exclude
anyone who the constitution
includes. So I don't wanna put

00:44:20.417-->00:44:25.167
education standards or
informational standards on what
constitutes an informed voter.

00:44:25.167-->00:44:30.875
>>[unclear response from
audience member] >>All humans
are subject to influence. Should

00:44:30.875-->00:44:36.083
I take that personally?
[audience laughs] No, point well
taken so we live in a world of

00:44:36.083-->00:44:40.917
humans with behavioral patterns
that can be influenced. I'm well
aware I've posed a bunch of

00:44:40.917-->00:44:45.292
questions to you that I don't
have good answers for myself,
but I respect that you've taken

00:44:45.292-->00:44:51.250
your time to join us and I hope
I've at least been a little bit
provocative and walked you

00:44:51.250-->00:44:57.208
through the various levels where
someone like me who both tries
to protect our continuity of

00:44:57.208-->00:45:03.042
government and continuity of our
constitutional system thinks
about these things because like

00:45:03.042-->00:45:08.125
yourselves, you think about
breaking systems, not
necessarily building them. And I

00:45:08.125-->00:45:14.458
think the more dialogue we have
betweeen well minded offense
with the defense who's either

00:45:14.458-->00:45:19.250
building or protecting these
things, I think that's the path
forward. So I think we're out of

00:45:19.250-->00:45:24.542
time. So with that I'm gonna say
