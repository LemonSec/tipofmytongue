00:00:00.000-->00:00:06.874
>>Uh our next uh our next
speaker is Chief Medical Officer
for the Intel Corporation. You

00:00:06.874-->00:00:13.847
might of heard of them. Umm and
I was I was surprised that Intel
had a Chief Medical Officer and

00:00:13.847-->00:00:19.753
I am personally really excited
to hear what uh Dr. John is
going to share with us. So

00:00:19.753-->00:00:24.758
please join me in welconing-
welcoming to the st- uh to the
DEFCON stage Dr. John Sotos.

00:00:31.865-->00:00:36.336
[applause] [indistinguishable
shouting off mic] Thanks I will
[voice off mic] Thank you very

00:00:36.336-->00:00:40.941
much. Did somebody say break?
>>[from crowd] BREAK! >>I'm a
cardiologist I'm not gonna

00:00:40.941-->00:00:45.946
destroy brain cells. [crowd
laughs] It's against my
professional ethics. [applause]

00:00:48.849-->00:00:52.586
So uh it's an honor to be here
today um I hope you get
something out of the talk at

00:00:52.586-->00:00:56.556
least something to think about
but first I of course I have to
start with disclaimers. What I'm

00:00:56.556-->00:01:02.095
gonna talk is not necessarily
the official position of Intel
or the Department of Defense.

00:01:02.095-->00:01:06.466
I've got a Department of Defense
affiliation too which I'll go
over. So anyway with that let's

00:01:06.466-->00:01:11.471
get going. I'm gonna use my um
pointer over on this side I hope
everybody uhhhhh ok. Well. Here

00:01:14.775-->00:01:19.780
we go. So first uhh let's go
back to 1978 when I was a
college student uhh in about

00:01:22.015-->00:01:27.421
this part of the country.
[clears throat] And umm I got
sick really sick I was sick as

00:01:27.421-->00:01:32.826
crap. I was laying in bed
shivering [clears throat] excuse
me, my teeth were actually

00:01:32.826-->00:01:39.433
chattering and every muscle in
my body hurt. Wasn't just me it
was everybody it seemed like.

00:01:39.433-->00:01:46.073
Well almost the professors
didn't get sick. Just the
students. And it wasn't just my

00:01:46.073-->00:01:51.044
college. At the Air Force
Academy 77 percent of the
recruits got sick, the cadets,

00:01:51.044-->00:01:56.049
sorry. It wasn't till 30 years
later I found out what had
happened. In 1918 that's when

00:01:59.386-->00:02:05.659
the story starts, a virus got
from a bird into humans and that
killed about 1 percent of the

00:02:05.659-->00:02:12.633
entire world's population in
1918. And that virus and its
descendants stayed circulating

00:02:12.633-->00:02:17.971
in the population for another 40
years or so. And you know how
there's an influenza every

00:02:17.971-->00:02:23.210
winter and there's a different
shot you get every winter the
virus changes little by little

00:02:23.210-->00:02:30.183
so over the next 40 years that
virus hung around. And then in
1957 it went away it was

00:02:30.183-->00:02:36.723
replaced by another influenza
virus, an H2 virus, and then in
1968 another virus replaced

00:02:36.723-->00:02:41.728
that. So far all is normal. In
1977 though, H1 came back. And
in fact it just wasn't a random

00:02:47.300-->00:02:52.305
H1 it was almost exactly
identical to the H1 from 1948.
And that's why the professors

00:02:57.377-->00:03:03.750
didn't get sick. The professors
had all gotten sick in 1948
cause they were older. It was

00:03:03.750-->00:03:08.755
only the students who had never
seen this virus that got sick in
1977. So how did that happen?

00:03:11.925-->00:03:18.832
Because these viruses change you
can't get a 30 year span in time
when a vi- when an influenza

00:03:18.832-->00:03:25.505
virus doesn't change. And so the
common consensus is the
reemergence on this virus in

00:03:25.505-->00:03:31.278
1977 is unexplained and probably
represents reinduct-
reintroduction to humans from a

00:03:31.278-->00:03:36.283
laboratory source. What does
that mean? It means something
got out of a lab. It got out of

00:03:38.418-->00:03:45.225
a lab and it came halfway across
the world and it got me. This is
where this virus first appeared

00:03:45.225-->00:03:49.563
in the wild, somewhere in
northeast Asia. We don't know if
it was the Soviet Union or

00:03:49.563-->00:03:56.002
China. But it went worldwide.
And it didn't affect the old and
the infirm it affected the

00:03:56.002-->00:04:00.941
healthiest people; the college
students. So you're affected by
this too because ever since

00:04:03.877-->00:04:10.450
then, the descendants of this H1
virus have stuck around and this
H3 virus has stuck around too.

00:04:10.450-->00:04:14.688
So every year when you get your
flu shot and I hope you do,
you're getting immunized against

00:04:14.688-->00:04:19.693
something like this and
something like this. So that's
the one of the motivations for

00:04:22.395-->00:04:28.802
this talk. Stuff that happens in
labs can have worldwide reach.
And we know that micro engineer-

00:04:28.802-->00:04:32.839
that engineering of
microorganisms is happening
every day today in laboratories.

00:04:32.839-->00:04:38.612
The question is: What is the
potential when malicious
engineering of organisms starts?

00:04:38.612-->00:04:43.917
And how do we defend against it?
And I would- claim that only
massive preemptive development

00:04:43.917-->00:04:48.188
of counterhacking bio
technologies can save the world.
Cause I think the threat is that

00:04:48.188-->00:04:54.628
grave. So who am I? As I
mentioned, I'm a cardiologist
who doesn't drink much. I work

00:04:54.628-->00:05:00.267
for Intel uh I've been in the
Air National Guard for 30 years
uh mostly as a rescue flight

00:05:00.267-->00:05:05.805
surgeon. I've been programming
since 1970 uh I don't get to do
much of it at Intel

00:05:05.805-->00:05:11.378
unfortunately that was my first
computer that I ever programmed
there. Am- am I a hacker? Do I

00:05:11.378-->00:05:16.883
deserve to be here? Well, I
wouldn't presume on the computer
side but I have an interest in

00:05:16.883-->00:05:21.955
what you might call diagnostic
hacking. Hacking the diagnostic
process. And I wrote a book on

00:05:21.955-->00:05:28.428
that and I was a professor for a
long time but uhhh you probably
know me if at all from my work

00:05:28.428-->00:05:35.035
on House for 6 years where I was
a consultant. And also on uh
Torchwood Miracle Day, and umm

00:05:35.035-->00:05:39.539
I'll be consulting for a new
show this fall on ABC called the
Good Doctor. So tune in Monday

00:05:39.539-->00:05:44.544
nights. [crowd laughs] So today
I wanna talk about uh epidemics
and bioweapons. Talk about

00:05:46.580-->00:05:52.519
digital biology. Uhh show how
exploits where they'll come from
and then uh conclude with a few

00:05:52.519-->00:05:59.125
uh reflections. So uh bioweapons
are actually amazingly effective
and they date from ancient

00:05:59.125-->00:06:03.763
times. The Hippocratic Oath that
all us physicians take that
started because there was a

00:06:03.763-->00:06:10.637
doctor who told his his military
commander how to poison a
village and uh over run it. So

00:06:10.637-->00:06:17.544
uh in the middle ages the black
plague killed about 25 percent
of Europe's population. Smallpox

00:06:17.544-->00:06:23.350
killed about 95 percent of the
Aztecs, that's why nobody in
this room knows any Aztecs.

00:06:23.350-->00:06:27.887
Influenza as I mentioned killed
uh 1 percent of the world's
population and it went

00:06:27.887-->00:06:33.360
everywhere there were only 2
places on earth it didn't go.
And even today we have an

00:06:33.360-->00:06:38.265
epidemic of small headed babies.
I mean who would have thought
such a thing is possible it

00:06:38.265-->00:06:43.803
turns out the Zika virus can do
that. And uh no less than Bill
Gates says "Of all the things

00:06:43.803-->00:06:48.975
that could kill more than 10
million people around the world,
the most likely is an epidemic."

00:06:48.975-->00:06:53.980
So uh we haven't even started to
see unnatural epidemics, just
the natural epidemics. So this I

00:06:56.916-->00:07:01.855
saw an exhibit in uh Oxford
England this is from a book
published in 1625. And um when

00:07:04.324-->00:07:10.397
the black plague came through
and so here you have obviously
death and the population of the

00:07:10.397-->00:07:15.802
town we fly, they try to get out
of the town you can see soldiers
stop them. But even though they

00:07:15.802-->00:07:22.309
try to flee, death follows them
and then we die. Here are the
coffins. So that's what we're up

00:07:22.309-->00:07:27.314
against. And the effect of
bioweapons can be long lasting.
Um the Brits tested some anthrax

00:07:30.083-->00:07:35.388
in the world war 2 and the
island where they tested it was
uninhabitable for 50 years.

00:07:35.388-->00:07:40.760
Malaria has affected the
evolution of multiple human
genes, I'v got a gene that that

00:07:40.760-->00:07:46.566
I have only because um my
ancestors survived malaria and
they were good at it. And about

00:07:46.566-->00:07:53.473
8 percent of your genome started
out in viruses. So the problem
there the reason you haven't

00:07:53.473-->00:07:58.545
heard much about bio weapons
when we talk about war fare is
they've been held back by a

00:07:58.545-->00:08:03.817
pretty severe limitation which
is a potential for blowback. If
I use a bio weapon on some

00:08:03.817-->00:08:09.055
adversary across a border, that
epidemic is probably gonna
spread back and get me to so

00:08:09.055-->00:08:14.494
that doesn't make it a great
weapon. There are international
treaties that outlaw bioweapons

00:08:14.494-->00:08:19.499
but you know treaties are easily
broken. So lets get now into um
the exploits and and how they

00:08:21.968-->00:08:25.472
might work and how to think
about them. The first thing to
realize is what's called the

00:08:25.472-->00:08:31.211
central dogma of biology. You
start with DNA and you make RNA
out of that and then you make a

00:08:31.211-->00:08:37.384
protein. And the proteins are
the real work horses of of life
they do various jobs. Now if you

00:08:37.384-->00:08:42.922
wanna make a medicine today,
you're usually making a medicine
that attacks the protein and for

00:08:42.922-->00:08:48.661
you know just convenience we can
call that analog therapy. Uh you
know you des- design a chemical

00:08:48.661-->00:08:53.767
that fits into the protein or
does something to it and this is
pretty difficult and its

00:08:53.767-->00:08:59.139
imprecise, there's lots of cross
reactivities across different
proteins and that makes it hard

00:08:59.139-->00:09:03.843
to design safe and effective new
medications. Its why drug
companies spend so much money

00:09:03.843-->00:09:10.216
developing drugs because it's so
difficult. So tomorrow though I
think we're gonna see digital

00:09:10.216-->00:09:16.656
medicines, and we're starting to
see a few. Remember RNA and DNA
are digital programs, they're

00:09:16.656-->00:09:21.661
written not in binary but in uh
quaternary code, A C T G A. Umm
and there amenable to digital

00:09:25.732-->00:09:32.071
manipulation which means you can
reprogram them and so this is
going to allow an algorithmic or

00:09:32.071-->00:09:37.076
a digital design of medications.
And the Cancer Moonshot which uh
vice president Biden uh of

00:09:39.479-->00:09:45.418
course pushed is going to really
uh drive these new technologies
to manipulate DNA. Because

00:09:45.418-->00:09:50.423
cancer really is a disease of
DNA. And if we get a good cancer
uh mechanism er uh uh mechanism

00:09:53.126-->00:09:59.699
to combat cancer going uh using
this root it's going to be
exquisitely persp- sp- specific.

00:09:59.699-->00:10:05.205
Because cancer cells are not
that different from normal
cells. OK and just some of the

00:10:05.205-->00:10:09.509
th- um catch words you might
have heard, some of these
digital DNA technologies,

00:10:09.509-->00:10:14.647
there's something called RNA
Interference which won a Nobel
prize in 2006. You've probably

00:10:14.647-->00:10:20.253
heard about Crispr cas9 and uh
for sure there will be a nobel
prize for that some day.

00:10:20.253-->00:10:25.258
There're things called gene
drives. Um spreading these um
DNA programs can be done through

00:10:27.327-->00:10:34.167
measles virus let's say it's
unbelievably contagious. Um and
even nanodiamonds can be used to

00:10:34.167-->00:10:40.573
get uh viruses, er uh DNA into
you. So what you could do with
this sort of t-uh digital

00:10:40.573-->00:10:45.778
approach to DNA and RNA is you
can do things like program in an
if/then statement. And this is

00:10:45.778-->00:10:52.018
already happened uh in fact
somebody programmed a 5 part
predicate in here for the if

00:10:52.018-->00:10:58.358
statement. So far nobody I don't
think is working too hard on th-
or is is succeeded in the deploy

00:10:58.358-->00:11:04.898
payload part but the if part is
is very uh well along the road.
And this sort of construct is

00:11:04.898-->00:11:09.903
gonna be the key to biohacking.
So um I'm from Intel we talk a
lot about Moore's Law, but uh

00:11:12.539-->00:11:18.478
biotechnology is blowing Moore's
law out of the water. Uh this
graph here shows how much it

00:11:18.478-->00:11:24.317
costs to sequence a human
genome, going back to I guess
that about 2000 I cant read it.

00:11:24.317-->00:11:29.489
Uh and this uh lines this
straight line is Moore's law and
this is the cost of genome

00:11:29.489-->00:11:35.128
sequencing and you can see it is
dropping way faster than Moore's
law. So in 10 years we might be

00:11:35.128-->00:11:41.568
talking about a 10 dollar genome
sequence. And uh you know these
sort of uh if/then statements

00:11:41.568-->00:11:47.440
are gonna continue to um get
better and better and so this
whole talk was prompted by the

00:11:47.440-->00:11:52.145
question: "With this kind of
exponential increase in
biotechnology, with new things

00:11:52.145-->00:11:58.084
like Crispr, where is bio
technology going to be in 5
years or 15 years?" And it's

00:11:58.084-->00:12:03.022
kinda scary because defensive
technology always lags offensive
technology. So um you know the

00:12:05.725-->00:12:11.431
Cancer Moonshot I would propose
is dual use. Just like nuclear
weapons and nuclear power are

00:12:11.431-->00:12:17.403
two sides of the same coin, the
ideal cancer treatment some day
is gonna be: the doctors gonna

00:12:17.403-->00:12:22.408
biopsy your tumor, get a sample,
send it down to the lab, the lab
will figure out the genetic

00:12:22.408-->00:12:28.881
syndrome, or the signature of
your exact cancer tumor, then
somebody will build a virus that

00:12:28.881-->00:12:33.886
using that if/then statement
only targets the cancer cells in
you. They'll put that virus

00:12:36.022-->00:12:42.195
inside you, you'll feel like you
have a cold for a few days, and
then that virus will go to work

00:12:42.195-->00:12:45.999
and tha- that's because the
virus is going to work
destroying your cancer, and then

00:12:45.999-->00:12:51.004
you'll wake up cancer free.
That's a pretty good deal, we
all want that to happen. But

00:12:51.004-->00:12:56.009
notice this exquisite targeting
overcomes that big drawback
against bio weapons. So the new

00:13:00.146-->00:13:06.919
technology is gonna allow
incredibly targeted bio weapons.
So think about 3 different axis.

00:13:06.919-->00:13:13.593
Who might you target? A specific
tissue? That's what cancer does
if that that cancer therapy. And

00:13:13.593-->00:13:19.599
if you wanted to edit an embryo
uh as is just starting now, uh
that will certainly come along

00:13:19.599-->00:13:25.371
too. But you could also target a
family like the royal family,
you could target a whole group

00:13:25.371-->00:13:30.877
of people, you could target an
entire species so that's the
who. Then there's the what you

00:13:30.877-->00:13:35.481
know if you're doing cures
that's great but you know you
might be making life

00:13:35.481-->00:13:40.286
inconvenient for somebody you
might be giving them a disease,
or you might be killing them.

00:13:40.286-->00:13:44.490
And then there's the when. And
uh there's a very important
factor here I'll talk about

00:13:44.490-->00:13:49.495
later too. So if you were gonna
cause death in an individual
well we'd call that

00:13:49.495-->00:13:55.935
assassination, or murder. If you
were gonna cause death in an
identifiable group of people,

00:13:55.935-->00:14:00.840
we'd call that genocide. And you
might say "Well, why would we
ever want to kill off an entire

00:14:00.840-->00:14:06.579
species?" If that species is the
malaria parasite, or if it's the
mosquito that carries Zika

00:14:06.579-->00:14:11.584
virus, or Yellow fever. You'd
want to kill those off too. So
certainly this part of the graph

00:14:13.753-->00:14:18.758
is uh in the sights of
scientists working today. And so
this talk is about what happens

00:14:22.128-->00:14:28.201
in this part of the graph. The
technology is inevitable, let's
remember that, everybody wants

00:14:28.201-->00:14:32.772
that cure for cancer. And so
they're gonna be you know I
think thousands of people down

00:14:32.772-->00:14:38.111
in the basement of hospitals
doing these viral manipulations.
This genetic program and that's

00:14:38.111-->00:14:43.116
a lot of power to put into those
people. So what could happen?
Umm let's talk about that. So

00:14:45.318-->00:14:51.357
first um let's talk about that
"what" axis. The damage people
could do. So I'm gonna use

00:14:51.357-->00:14:56.729
genetic diseases as a guidebook
for exploits. And here I define
disease as any kind of abnormal

00:14:56.729-->00:15:01.434
function in your body. So an
exploit is anything that
includes a genetic that induces

00:15:01.434-->00:15:06.472
a genetic disease. So here's an
example. Here a rare genetic
disease called Xeroderma

00:15:06.472-->00:15:12.879
Pigmentosum. Add this uh little
girl has it and it's a defect of
DNA repair that arises from a

00:15:12.879-->00:15:19.285
variant in the XPA gene, one of
the 25 thousand genes that you
have in your body. And these

00:15:19.285-->00:15:25.158
people are intolerant of
sunlight. Every time sunlight
hits your skin, it damages DNA.

00:15:25.158-->00:15:30.163
But your body repairs it. These
people don't have that repair
capability. So when they go out

00:15:32.932-->00:15:39.172
in the sun they will blister
after a few minutes. OK now if
you're hackers and you could

00:15:39.172-->00:15:44.544
deploy something like this
worldwide, you know, why might
you want to do it? Think about

00:15:44.544-->00:15:51.117
that for a few minutes and and
I'll come back and and give you
a suggestion. So there's lots of

00:15:51.117-->00:15:56.889
potential in our hu- human
genomes to cause this kind of
problem. This is um my mentor at

00:15:56.889-->00:16:03.596
at Johns Hopkins he was a
terrific guy and back in the
1960s he started collecting

00:16:03.596-->00:16:10.069
every inherited trait that the
profession of medicine could
identify in humans. And uuh this

00:16:10.069-->00:16:16.175
is my copy of his book. Uh in
1990 that's the 1990 version and
if you've read Moby Dick you

00:16:16.175-->00:16:22.949
know you can see that it's way
bigger than Moby Dick. And that
was in 1990. And since then the

00:16:22.949-->00:16:29.088
book got so big they couldn't
publish it in hard copy anymore
and this only goes up to 2004.

00:16:29.088-->00:16:33.926
And uh you know I think they
just gave up counting at that
point. So we know a lot about

00:16:33.926-->00:16:38.931
what happens in people's bodies.
So within this book this big
book of uh genetic umm ummmm

00:16:44.303-->00:16:49.075
susceptibilities in human beings
there's a lot of stuff. And in
fact there's some stuff worse

00:16:49.075-->00:16:53.679
than dying. And I and I call
that hell. And and you don't
want to know what that is. What

00:16:53.679-->00:17:00.186
could happen. So the question is
really: "What happens in these 2
places?" So let's give some

00:17:00.186-->00:17:06.893
examples. So let's say you were
a passionate animal rights
person. And you didn't want

00:17:06.893-->00:17:12.465
people eating animals, you might
be uh a passionate vegetarian as
well. Well there's a disease

00:17:12.465-->00:17:17.837
called Ornitheintranscarbamolise
defficiency which is in that big
book, and it arises from a

00:17:17.837-->00:17:24.610
variant in the OTC gene. So if
you could spread if you could
mess up everybody's OTC gene

00:17:24.610-->00:17:29.448
across the world, all the
sudden, almost nobody in the
world could eat meat. That's

00:17:29.448-->00:17:36.022
something that as a an extreme
vegetarian you might uh want to
have happen. Let's say you

00:17:36.022-->00:17:41.093
believed in sexual chastity and
you really wanted to punish
people who were a little

00:17:41.093-->00:17:45.998
profligate, you could make
everybody in the world hyper
susceptible to Gonorrhea by

00:17:45.998-->00:17:51.003
messing with the C5 or the C6 7
8 or 9 genes. It'd cause lots of
other problems, but you could

00:17:53.172-->00:17:59.145
you could make people really
susceptible to Gonorrhea. Let's
say I didn't want anybody at

00:17:59.145-->00:18:05.585
DEFCON to do a shot. And I
wanted to make them intolerant
to alcohol. I could screw with

00:18:05.585-->00:18:10.589
their ALDH2 gene or to go back
to xeroderma pigmentosum if I
wanted all women to be veiled

00:18:13.259-->00:18:18.264
when they went outside I could
design something that would mess
up the XPA gene only in women.

00:18:20.967-->00:18:25.972
Or if I wanted uh to uh blur the
some of the distinctions between
races I could um distribute

00:18:28.507-->00:18:34.747
genes or uh vectors that would
cause skin color to change. If
I'm a pharmaceutical company uh

00:18:34.747-->00:18:38.818
and I have a drug that treats
some genetic illness, how great
would it be if everybody in the

00:18:38.818-->00:18:44.991
world had that genetic illness?
That would do wonders for sales.
And let's say um you were once

00:18:44.991-->00:18:48.694
turned down for the astronaut
program because you were
colorblind, I don't know who

00:18:48.694-->00:18:54.300
that might be. But you're
looking at him. [crowd laughs]
And um [more laughter] let's say

00:18:54.300-->00:18:59.305
you wanted everybody in the
world to be colorblind, then
they couldn't turn you down.

00:19:01.807-->00:19:06.412
[crowd laughs] So there's more
[clears throat.] Let's say I
just don't want to um hurt

00:19:06.412-->00:19:13.285
people but I want to target
national economies I have a a
nat- uh an enemy an adversary

00:19:13.285-->00:19:19.158
and I know that it would
bankrupt their economy to take
care of epidemic expensive

00:19:19.158-->00:19:24.196
diseases. So there are ways that
I could give people cancer,
Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's

00:19:24.196-->00:19:29.668
disease, cystic fibrosis, I
could give everybody pain all
the time. Or I could make them

00:19:29.668-->00:19:35.508
insensitive to pain, which,
trust me, uh causes a lot of
problems. I could immuno-

00:19:35.508-->00:19:42.448
compromise people or I could
accelerate aging. Umm [clears
throat] let's say I just wanted

00:19:42.448-->00:19:47.453
to impair uh do things to impair
workers. I could give everybody
narcolepsy. Um the face

00:19:49.722-->00:19:55.327
blindness syndrome is probably
genetically deter- uhh mediated
no one's discovered the gene

00:19:55.327-->00:20:01.734
yet. Or if I wanted to give a
whole generation of children
learning disabilities so um some

00:20:01.734-->00:20:08.040
country couldn't compete against
me, I could do that.
[breathes][sucks teeth] Let's

00:20:08.040-->00:20:14.013
say I just objected to se- to a
life style. Um you know I could
make everybody deaf or blind and

00:20:14.013-->00:20:19.452
look at this there are 540 genes
that goes into our that go into
our hearing process and 600

00:20:19.452-->00:20:25.391
genes that go into vision. Could
make everybody night blind,
interfere with taste and smell,

00:20:25.391-->00:20:30.730
and destroy uh a big industry
right from that. There are
genetically des- er mediated

00:20:30.730-->00:20:36.535
diseases that make you die from
excitement, these are cardiology
diseases actually. And then

00:20:36.535-->00:20:41.540
there are diseases of physical
fragility. OK, we've got a few
more. Uh epidemic micropenis,

00:20:43.576-->00:20:49.248
ummm [crowd laughs]. Epidemic
erectile disfunction, or you
could make everybody uh hyper

00:20:49.248-->00:20:54.286
libidinous. You could I think I
couldn't quite find the gene but
I'm sure this is genetically

00:20:54.286-->00:20:59.625
determined somehow, uhh you
could fix it so a nation just
became a nation of sons or a

00:20:59.625-->00:21:05.397
nation of daughters. Um there
are reports that uh certain
organizations uh were looking to

00:21:05.397-->00:21:10.703
try to change the sexual
preference of their adversaries
and uh you could sterilize an

00:21:10.703-->00:21:17.676
entire population. Uh let's say
I just wanted to mess with some
politicians and you know I could

00:21:17.676-->00:21:24.550
make somebody go totally bald or
I could give them a really bad
fishy odor and that is actually

00:21:24.550-->00:21:30.089
an incredibly tough disease to
have. It's caused by this TMAU
gene because there's no

00:21:30.089-->00:21:34.527
treatment for it and it's
impossible to disguise the odor
and those people have a very

00:21:34.527-->00:21:39.832
difficult time socially. Uh I
could give somebody intractable
diarrhea, cause them massive

00:21:39.832-->00:21:44.904
weight gain, or um you know in
some forms of Tourette's
syndrome which is mediated by

00:21:44.904-->00:21:50.009
this gene, people uh
involuntarily uh emit
obscenities, so that would be uh

00:21:50.009-->00:21:55.147
interesting in a politician. I
put this in before uh Mr.
Scaramucci started [crowd

00:21:55.147-->00:22:00.886
laughs] his work, so. [laughter
and applause] We might have to
cross it off the list. [crowd

00:22:00.886-->00:22:06.992
laughs] OK that's the what. Umm
we talked a little bit about the
population um I would recommend

00:22:06.992-->00:22:12.998
keeping your genome secret, ummm
so you know we talked about the
royal family and you know you

00:22:12.998-->00:22:17.636
could get just uh DNA from one
member of the royal family and
and you could then target the

00:22:17.636-->00:22:24.043
whole family. Um you know this
word "race" is uh very squishy,
but if you use it to mean any

00:22:24.043-->00:22:29.882
observable physical
characteristic defines a race,
then um you know it it becomes

00:22:29.882-->00:22:34.386
possible to think about in a
sort of rigorous way. So for
instance um there's a gene

00:22:34.386-->00:22:39.391
called EDAR and 87 percent of
asians have that. And um you can
exclude asian descent in nearly

00:22:42.127-->00:22:48.133
100 percent of europeans and
africans by looking at this one
gene. So if you wanted to do uh

00:22:48.133-->00:22:53.138
racial elimination um EDAR is a
good place to start if this is
your target. So obviously this

00:22:55.174-->00:23:01.213
is very dangerous if used by
hate groups. And then there are
easy ways to identify uh genetic

00:23:01.213-->00:23:06.785
males and genetic females, which
of course is genetic. Umm you
know identifying ethnic groups

00:23:06.785-->00:23:13.325
is a little tougher. Uh you know
Tay Sachs disease tends to run
in umm the Ashkenazi jewish

00:23:13.325-->00:23:19.265
group. But even there it its not
very good uh quote unquote, if
uh you're using it to target

00:23:19.265-->00:23:25.170
them. So that may be sort of a a
blessing you know interbreeding
uh is is helpful. Umm and we

00:23:25.170-->00:23:31.543
talked about species, uh you
know if you're a dog person and
you want to wipe out cats you

00:23:31.543-->00:23:38.284
can do that or vica versa. Uh
you could wipe out uh food
sources. And you know if you um

00:23:38.284-->00:23:44.590
wanted to kill a wine crop uh if
you're from Napa and you wanted
to kill the French wine industry

00:23:44.590-->00:23:51.163
uh you might be able to do that.
So let's talk about time. Um you
know I think it's possible to

00:23:51.163-->00:23:55.634
build binary weapons, so you
insert one thing but the bad
thing doesn't happen until a

00:23:55.634-->00:24:01.240
second agent is exposed. But the
really interesting thing about
time is yeah I could do

00:24:01.240-->00:24:07.179
something to everybody who is
living here and make some of you
sick or whatever but if we can

00:24:07.179-->00:24:12.184
get that gene change into the
cells that make sperm and ova,
then it's in human beings umm in

00:24:16.689-->00:24:21.694
perpetuity until somehow they
all get fixed. Umm so this is
just the RNA and the DNA part

00:24:25.397-->00:24:31.870
you know there's a whole nother
field called epigenetics and
epigenetics is way the

00:24:31.870-->00:24:37.142
environment umm signals in the
environment are transmitted to
your genome. So for example if

00:24:37.142-->00:24:42.681
you moved to Denver where the
air is thin where there's not
much oxygen, somehow that signal

00:24:42.681-->00:24:48.587
has to get from the oxygen in
the air into your genome so that
you can make more red blood

00:24:48.587-->00:24:55.361
cells. So there're gonna be I
think a whole host of
epigenetics uh exploits that uh

00:24:55.361-->00:25:00.366
I really haven't started to
think about too much. Umm and
then uh targeting based on the

00:25:00.366-->00:25:05.371
microbiome uh would also be uh
possible. So uh to summarize,
you know a lot of this is

00:25:08.073-->00:25:13.078
possible now, some of the these
engineering um angles but it's
very difficult. And so not many

00:25:15.214-->00:25:21.387
people can do it. But um with
the progress that we all hope
the cancer moonshot will make,

00:25:21.387-->00:25:26.859
its gonna get easier and easier
to do these kind of things. And
then when it's to the point that

00:25:26.859-->00:25:31.864
thousands of people can do this
sort of stuff, we have a real
problem. So um my first uh

00:25:35.968-->00:25:41.807
statement to you is: don't do
this stuff. Umm there's there's
just no point in doing that.

00:25:41.807-->00:25:45.878
Yeah we know it can be done,
you're not showing anybody
you're smart if you do this. Uh

00:25:45.878-->00:25:50.883
but if you have a chance to talk
about this problem with policy
makers uh do that. Um you know

00:25:53.051-->00:25:57.156
if this group gets scared
because not much scares this
group, but if this group gets

00:25:57.156-->00:26:01.894
scared, I think that'll get
their attention. Or get involved
more directly. Go into

00:26:01.894-->00:26:07.266
bioscience yourself and uh try
and put your digital way of
thinking to work in trying to

00:26:07.266-->00:26:12.738
build the defensive technology
for this. I don't have all the
answers that's for sure, so we

00:26:12.738-->00:26:19.445
need a lot of help. What I would
tell the policy makers to do is
to, and and this is very

00:26:19.445-->00:26:22.681
difficult for them its
essentially saying "You have to
start working on defensive

00:26:22.681-->00:26:28.854
technology for an offensive
technology that isn't here yet."
But the goals are really quite

00:26:28.854-->00:26:33.492
laudatory in a sense that the
first step is to figure out how
to cure every infectious disease

00:26:33.492-->00:26:38.997
known to science. And you'd want
to do that using some sort of
digital technology. And that

00:26:38.997-->00:26:44.369
alone would create the largest
amount of wealth that I think uh
the world will have ever seen

00:26:44.369-->00:26:49.541
when you think about how much
infectious disease costs mankind
and and how much people would

00:26:49.541-->00:26:54.546
pay uh not to get infected. Um
but that's only the first step
um because there're gonna be

00:26:57.716-->00:27:02.187
unnatural infectious diseases
that people will build and so
we're gonna have to develop an

00:27:02.187-->00:27:07.192
infrastructure that will be able
to detect new agents and then
characterize the infection,

00:27:09.862-->00:27:15.300
devise a countermeasure, produce
the countermeasure, produce the
countermeasure in millions or

00:27:15.300-->00:27:21.173
billions of doses and then
distribute it across the world,
and oh yeah, probably within a

00:27:21.173-->00:27:27.880
month or a couple weeks, of the
time the disease is detected
because that's how long it takes

00:27:27.880-->00:27:34.686
you know a disease that we get
here could go everywhere in a
couple weeks. And you know, not

00:27:34.686-->00:27:39.691
too long ago uhh in- infections
were of a magnitude that we can
hardly believe today. In 1947

00:27:41.727-->00:27:48.233
New York vaccinated 6 million
people in 4 weeks against
smallpox. So I don't think this

00:27:48.233-->00:27:53.205
is necessarily impossible, I
think it's harder than a
moonshot, it's like a Mars shot

00:27:53.205-->00:27:59.611
though. If you're interested in
this and you want to get more
motivated or maybe I should say

00:27:59.611-->00:28:04.917
if you're not interested and you
think "Uh is this guy up here
talking crazy?" um this is a

00:28:04.917-->00:28:09.922
novel that was published in the
1990s and um it is a terrific
novel just on its own merits but

00:28:13.158-->00:28:17.829
eh in the introduction the
author says uh "All the science
is in this novel is true except

00:28:17.829-->00:28:22.801
for 3 things, and I'm not gonna
tell you what they are." So
that's what the author said, so

00:28:22.801-->00:28:28.507
uh read it and and have a good
time and think about it. And
then finally thanks for sticking

00:28:28.507-->00:28:33.645
around today toward the end of
the conference and hearing um
remember that uh as we leave the

00:28:33.645-->00:28:39.985
conference we're gonna go back
all over the world so it's a
pretty good thing that we're not

00:28:39.985-->00:28:44.990
carrying any bad bugs with us.
Thank you very much. [crowd
applause] Uhh, John, do I have

00:28:53.298-->00:28:58.804
time for questions? Where's
John? >>Yeah you do. >>OK. Do
they go to the mics? Whats they

00:28:58.804-->00:29:03.742
uh..: >>Yeah >>Routine here?
>>If you've got a question, come
to me. >>Thanks. So I think one

00:29:27.833-->00:29:32.504
of your colleagues just tweeted
that you said "Don't share your
genome." And I'm wondering how

00:29:32.504-->00:29:39.444
you see reconciling that with
doing the research that's needed
to better understand genomic

00:29:39.444-->00:29:46.018
medicine and also to treat
people genomically, presumably
for me to get that precise

00:29:46.018-->00:29:52.190
treatment I'm gonna have to
share my genomic information.
>>Yeah, if you've got a genetic

00:29:52.190-->00:29:57.863
disorder umm you have
approximate threat to your
existence and to your life and

00:29:57.863-->00:30:03.168
so there the balance would tip
towards sharing the genome so
thank you for asking that.

00:30:03.168-->00:30:08.807
That's worth a clarification.
Everything in life is a risk
benefit balance and so I would

00:30:08.807-->00:30:13.812
say umm don't share your genome
without reason. Without good
reason. >>Hey um so attribution

00:30:18.650-->00:30:22.954
is a famously challenging
problem in computer security,
determining the wh- the origins

00:30:22.954-->00:30:27.492
of malicious software. I was
wondering if there is any
current work that you know of

00:30:27.492-->00:30:32.698
going on around um watermarking
these modifications to genomes
or other techniques that could

00:30:32.698-->00:30:37.703
be used to trace their source
and their progress. >>I I
couldn't understand that

00:30:37.703-->00:30:38.937
question. I mean >>Oh 

00:30:38.937-->00:30:43.909
>>>Talk a little slower.
>>Sorry, heh [crowd laughs], um
so so attribution is this famous

00:30:43.909-->00:30:47.713
problem in computer security
like um when a... >>Oh
>>..malware spreads around the

00:30:47.713-->00:30:49.047
world... >>Yeah >>...where did
it come from? 

00:30:49.047-->00:30:53.185
>>>Yeah >>...was it Russia? Was
it China? You know? >>Yeah >>Um
and so what I was wondering is

00:30:53.185-->00:30:58.824
is there any current work
happening in genomics that you
know of umm around developing

00:30:58.824-->00:31:05.030
ways to uh watermark or
otherwise umm annotate these
modifications so that you can

00:31:05.030-->00:31:09.735
determine where they came from
and how? >>Uh that's an
interesting question . So uh no

00:31:09.735-->00:31:15.540
I haven't heard of that you know
um the whole science of
epidemiology uh focuses on where

00:31:15.540-->00:31:21.813
did things where did infections
come from? How did they spread?
And that's been very difficult

00:31:21.813-->00:31:28.587
over the hundreds of years that
epidemiology has been a science.
And even when we look in genomes

00:31:28.587-->00:31:33.592
we can get some help so uh but
but not the kind not the kind of
help that you want. So I can if

00:31:37.028-->00:31:42.033
I gave you influenza um the
match between our two viruses
would be like 100 percent minus

00:31:45.771-->00:31:50.776
epsilon. Some really small
number. But if he got influenza
from somebody in Portugal it

00:31:53.745-->00:31:58.750
would still be Influenza A an H1
or whatever but his difference
between your 2 influences would

00:32:01.586-->00:32:06.591
be bigger. So you can do some
sort you can do tracing that way
uh but you can't go and say "Oh

00:32:09.694-->00:32:14.699
it's started in you know the
Amazon jungle." or anything like
that. >>[off mic] If you could

00:32:16.802-->00:32:20.605
[unclear] you could like
actually code that genome. Like
you could code [unclear] >>So

00:32:20.605-->00:32:26.978
the question is about in coding
uh signing modifications uh that
you put into the genome sure.

00:32:26.978-->00:32:31.983
There's lots of room in the cell
you can add a few more uh DNA
base pairs um that you know

00:32:34.319-->00:32:39.324
somehow you would claim or
something like that and and put
a signature in there. >>Thanks.

00:32:41.660-->00:32:46.665
>>So, I'm thinking a little bit
about data archiving. In long
term data archiving large

00:32:50.268-->00:32:55.273
amounts of data um one of our
primary concerns is bit rot. And
and so we so we check that

00:32:58.443-->00:33:04.082
frequently and then readjust it
from available sources. I'm
wondering if it- it would be

00:33:04.082-->00:33:09.087
reasonable to think about the
DNA umm in an archiving maybe
personal archiving sort of like

00:33:12.023-->00:33:18.630
backing it up where then with
frequent checking you could find
something that had gone awry and

00:33:18.630-->00:33:23.635
then essentially restore it by
doing it. >>Yeah. [chuckles] Do
you have an identical twin? >>No

00:33:26.004-->00:33:32.510
>>Too bad. [audience laughs] Umm
so [more laughter] Uhh yeah
identical twins are are great

00:33:32.510-->00:33:39.384
great for that kind of backup
well. You know uh for cancer umm
eeh you know there there's

00:33:39.384-->00:33:45.557
another way which is um se- er
cord blood. You know when babies
are born they have the umbilical

00:33:45.557-->00:33:50.562
cord and nowadays you can snip
that umbilical cord and put it
in a freezer and uh that thing

00:33:53.732-->00:33:58.737
is that cord the blood in that
cord is loaded with stem cells.
And ummm you know if you get a

00:34:01.006-->00:34:07.279
leukemia later you can go back
to the cord blood and you have a
sample of blood there that is

00:34:07.279-->00:34:12.884
essentially the backup you're
talking about there's no
leukemic cells in it. Umm you

00:34:12.884-->00:34:17.856
know that was sort of the rage a
few years ago I don't even know
the technology may have passed

00:34:17.856-->00:34:22.861
that by, I can't say, but you
know just from a um from a sort
of IT perspective if you put

00:34:25.163-->00:34:30.168
your entire genome in some
digital format and put it on a
hard drive or something umm the

00:34:32.470-->00:34:38.276
question is how do you restore
from that backup? So you know
they're several trillion cells

00:34:38.276-->00:34:43.949
in you and that's the worst case
scenario is you'd need to get
that backup into every one of

00:34:43.949-->00:34:48.853
those cells but if it was the
sort of thing where you got
leukemia and they were saying:

00:34:48.853-->00:34:53.858
Hey we can't find any non
leukemic cells in your blood to
do a transplant, a bone marrow

00:34:53.858-->00:34:59.931
transplant on you maybe someday
in the future you could go back
to that digital backup ,build

00:34:59.931-->00:35:04.869
some cells with your correct DNA
and then infuse those into you.
>>Regarding your uhh device to

00:35:10.842-->00:35:15.847
work on contra measures umm
working on contra measures means
to go through the same

00:35:19.551-->00:35:24.556
technology because if we need to
fix the- um actually is easier
to break then to fix so the

00:35:27.826-->00:35:32.831
whole genetic therapy it- it-
it's a bit old and but it's
really declined because its

00:35:35.834-->00:35:41.706
really very difficult to fix
stuff...to break is... >>Yeah
yeah that's why defensive

00:35:41.706-->00:35:47.746
technology tends to lag behind
offensive technology. But I
would say there there's still

00:35:47.746-->00:35:54.719
ways you could do it. So let's
say Crispr turns out to be the
former Director of National

00:35:54.719-->00:36:01.192
Intelligence for the United
States called Crispr a weapon of
mass destruction. So if just

00:36:01.192-->00:36:06.131
working on anti-Crispr
technology for instance might be
a way to go. So that you know

00:36:06.131-->00:36:12.370
whatever program is embedded in
some sort of Crispr
implementation if you ca- had a

00:36:12.370-->00:36:17.375
way to kill the Crispr part umm
that would be potentially in
some situations useful. Umm and

00:36:20.678-->00:36:26.618
the same thi- you know but I
think Crispr might be kind of
easy. Other things like RNA

00:36:26.618-->00:36:31.322
interference that might be
really hard to develop
countermeasures for that. But

00:36:31.322-->00:36:38.229
that that's what I was thinking
when I made that statement.
>>Hey. So I've noticed a recent

00:36:38.229-->00:36:41.433
rise in popularity of these
ser... >>Talk slower, 'cause
>>Oh my apologies >>Yeah,

00:36:41.433-->00:36:45.804
'cause... >>So I've noticed a
recent rise in popularity of
these services where say they'll

00:36:45.804-->00:36:50.508
send you a vile, uh you spit in
it, you send it back, they give
you information on your genome.

00:36:50.508-->00:36:54.879
I've seen uhh a lot of uh
educational channels on youtube
encouraging people to go out and

00:36:54.879-->00:36:58.917
do this. Uh and it seems quite
an interesting thing to do if
not something uh information

00:36:58.917-->00:37:03.321
that would be good to know.
However I worry about the
security of these sort of uh, of

00:37:03.321-->00:37:08.093
these sort of organizations. Are
they selling my data? Um what
government organizations? Uhh

00:37:08.093-->00:37:13.098
wh- what would your advice be
for the security of these? Where
do you think uh how do you think

00:37:13.098-->00:37:18.336
we could make sure that uhh our
data isn't being sent out? Uh
should we discourage family

00:37:18.336-->00:37:22.907
members and friends from using
these? That sort of thing?
>>Yeah I think it comes back to

00:37:22.907-->00:37:28.813
a bit of what the first
questioner asked was the risk
benefit trade off. So if you

00:37:28.813-->00:37:35.553
have a medical condition where
you think your care could be
improved if the full genome were

00:37:35.553-->00:37:40.558
known, ok I can see that. But if
you're trying to figure out
whether you're Lithuanian or

00:37:43.828-->00:37:48.833
Greek or something else, you
know, who cares? Ummm [audience
laughter] Soo [scattered

00:37:59.511-->00:38:01.713
applause] [laughs] [applause]
And you know I had a friend do
that and he found out that his

00:38:01.713-->00:38:06.718
father wasn't his father so you
know you really can't get great
news from it. But you know

00:38:10.688-->00:38:15.527
[audience laughs] ehh eehh it
what I worry about as a
physician is let's say there are

00:38:15.527-->00:38:19.664
5 thousand diseases that are
mediated by genetics. There are
probably more but lets say there

00:38:19.664-->00:38:25.270
are 5 thousand. And let's say
some day you get a report back
that lists your risk for all

00:38:25.270-->00:38:30.241
those diseases. Well you're
gonna be at above average risk
for 25 hundred diseases, just

00:38:30.241-->00:38:35.747
statistically. And so if you
come in to see me and I'm your
doctor and you start talking

00:38:35.747-->00:38:41.386
about 25 hundred diseases that
you're at risk for, I have no
time to talk to you about

00:38:41.386-->00:38:47.392
anything else. You know, I know
that getting your blood pressure
down by 10 points is gonna ss-

00:38:47.392-->00:38:51.930
extend your life by so many
years or helping you to quit
cigarette smoking is gonna

00:38:51.930-->00:38:58.369
extend your life by 10 years. So
you crowd all of that out for
this information that really

00:38:58.369-->00:39:05.310
isn't helpful. So uh that's
that's what I would think about.
Medicine is very aggressive in

00:39:05.310-->00:39:12.050
the sense that you know if if we
have a way to decrease your risk
of disease um we'll develop

00:39:12.050-->00:39:15.987
screening technologies around
that. But if we don't have any
way to decrease we don't have a

00:39:15.987-->00:39:20.291
way to decrease your risk of
rheumatoid arthritis your risk
of psoriasis or anyth- anything

00:39:20.291-->00:39:26.464
like that so there's no point
umm in a preventative way of of
coming of getting tested for

00:39:26.464-->00:39:31.469
that and coming to talk to me
about it. >>Thank you >>Mmm-hmm
>>So the topic has come up a

00:39:33.838-->00:39:39.844
couple times now that...
>>Slower, yeah cause my there
yeah >>That it's easier to crash

00:39:39.844-->00:39:44.682
a human than fix it. {clears
throat] The number one problem
with gene therapy that we've

00:39:44.682-->00:39:49.120
observed from our historical
data is random insertions into
the genome that lead to

00:39:49.120-->00:39:53.958
different errors that are
actually much more catastrophic
than the error you were trying

00:39:53.958-->00:39:58.963
to fix. So is anyone working on
how you would be able to have a
defensive strategy to not have

00:40:01.399-->00:40:06.404
that happen? Because in its
current state gene therapy is
kind of like playing russian

00:40:06.404-->00:40:12.977
roulette. >>So [clears throat]
um let's go back to that big
thick book that I showed a

00:40:12.977-->00:40:19.651
picture of. Most of the diseases
in there are single gene
diseases. Uhh like that

00:40:19.651-->00:40:24.656
xeroderma pigmentosum that's one
gene. But if you look at what
humans tend to suffer from:

00:40:26.991-->00:40:33.064
obesity, alzheimer's disease,
anthroscoladic heart disease,
you know the common stuff, those

00:40:33.064-->00:40:39.904
are multiple gene diseases. And
so umm it's there are almost
like two different sets of

00:40:39.904-->00:40:46.144
targets. The single gene
diseases we understand how to
find em and we understand how

00:40:46.144-->00:40:51.416
repair would occur
theoretically. The multiple gene
diseases and I think this is

00:40:51.416-->00:40:56.421
what you're saying are much more
mysterious .You know if there
are 640 genes that go toward

00:41:00.024-->00:41:05.930
making your visual system work
correctly, uh thats a bad
example. If there are 50 genes

00:41:05.930-->00:41:12.537
that are involved in umm
atherosclerosis you know when
you start tweaking one its gonna

00:41:12.537-->00:41:18.676
have a bunch of other effects
and your not gonna maybe find a
big effect from any one gene so

00:41:18.676-->00:41:24.248
now you're talking about
diddling with multiple genes and
so that's really hard and that's

00:41:24.248-->00:41:29.620
gonna be quite a ways in the
future. Is is that what you're
asking about? >>Uhhh >>Cause

00:41:29.620-->00:41:34.225
this you you mentioned like stop
codons and things like that
that's sort of the single gene

00:41:34.225-->00:41:40.131
disease. >>Yeah it doesn't
matter how many genes are
involved in the disease. If you

00:41:40.131-->00:41:47.071
introduce something into the
code that was external so you
downloaded information and it

00:41:47.071-->00:41:53.344
went to the wrong file... >>Mmm
>>...and it caused an error that
was significantly worse than the

00:41:53.344-->00:41:58.349
original error, the best case
was a single gene gene therapy
approach the genes randomly

00:42:00.451-->00:42:05.390
inserted into the genome and
caused leukemia in most of the
patients in that population.

00:42:05.390-->00:42:10.027
>>Yeah so that's gonna be part
of the safety and efficacy
evaluation of any new

00:42:10.027-->00:42:16.834
therapeutic that comes out. So
you know the first gene therapy
efforts umm didn't work. You

00:42:16.834-->00:42:23.307
know it it caused harm but
lessons were learned from that
and so it's getting better. So

00:42:23.307-->00:42:28.913
uhh like an earlier questioner
said, it's always easier to
break something than to fix

00:42:28.913-->00:42:33.684
something. And any attempt to
fi- every attempt to fix
something you know you have to

00:42:33.684-->00:42:38.356
be prepared for unintended
consequences. And so its just
gona be a matter of ref-

00:42:38.356-->00:42:44.429
refining techniques. Your point
is well taken uhh but medicine
is is pretty used accustomed to

00:42:44.429-->00:42:49.434
trying to work out what the
adverse effects of any therapy
are. >>Mmmm one final comment on

00:42:51.836-->00:42:56.841
that. Do you think it would be a
bit more responsible to target
something that's not the

00:43:00.111-->00:43:05.116
equivalent to the source code?
>>Umm well that might be like
the microbiome because if you

00:43:09.187-->00:43:15.793
screw up your microbiome in some
terrible way you can always
flush it out and load and reboot

00:43:15.793-->00:43:21.799
essentially by eating the feces
of some other person and uhh
you're good to go. [crowd

00:43:21.799-->00:43:25.870
laughs] >>That would be a much
better approach. >>OK I'll put
you down for the feces eating.

00:43:28.539-->00:43:32.777
[audience laughs] >>Huh that was
the most scientific way I've
ever seen somebody put down a

00:43:32.777-->00:43:37.782
question. That was amazing.
[audience laughter] >>Uh close-
eh closely related to the uh

00:43:42.286-->00:43:47.291
last question, eh would there be
a way or is there any research
going towards ehh basically

00:43:50.661-->00:43:55.666
locking the editing of the
genetic sequence. >>Yeah >>Turn
evolution into something purely

00:43:59.971-->00:44:05.510
directed that would be the int-
the there would be no more
natural vectors of evolution if

00:44:05.510-->00:44:10.515
we did that but it would secure
the uh the the the whole code.
>>Uhh I that that's a very

00:44:13.351-->00:44:19.490
interesting idea. I I don't
think there's any work going on
that. Uhhh I wouldn't know how

00:44:19.490-->00:44:24.495
to implement that. Umm you know
there there's 6 uh billion uh
between the 2 parents

00:44:26.998-->00:44:32.003
contributions that're fff-
billions of base pairs and so
you know we have uh the 2 rungs

00:44:35.306-->00:44:42.113
of the double helix which uh
provide some measure of error
correction in there and it is

00:44:42.113-->00:44:47.118
possible to build a triple
helixes using not DNA but
there's now uh new kinds of NAs,

00:44:50.254-->00:44:55.993
XNA, and you can build triple
helixes so you could actually
umm increase the error

00:44:55.993-->00:45:00.565
correcting capabilities but then
I think you've got something
that's not a human at that

00:45:00.565-->00:45:05.570
point. Because ummm it's just so
different from us. >>[inaudible]
...we gotta get through...ok

00:45:08.139-->00:45:13.144
>>Hi there how are you doing? Uh
so I have 2 questions, 1 is
pretty quick. Umm you talked

00:45:16.414-->00:45:22.553
about changing some physical
traits about people to target
certain groups. But how complex

00:45:22.553-->00:45:28.025
do you think we could uh develop
that technology? Such as if
someone has a birth defect where

00:45:28.025-->00:45:34.131
there fingers may not grow
properly do you think we would
be able to correct that and then

00:45:34.131-->00:45:40.404
through there uhh I guess
preteen years when their bodies
are developing more they would

00:45:40.404-->00:45:45.409
be able to grow proper fingers,
I guess? >>So uh there are a lot
of people working on that. Umm

00:45:47.979-->00:45:53.551
you know there are some
malformations that occur not
because of problems in the

00:45:53.551-->00:45:59.624
genetic code but because of
environmental influences. So if
you have an encounter with a

00:45:59.624-->00:46:04.562
chainsaw you know you could end
up with a uh an abnormality in
your anatomical structure. So um

00:46:08.499-->00:46:14.605
you know I had a friend who um
found out that the tips of your
fingers, the skin on the tips

00:46:14.605-->00:46:20.311
actually regenerates and so he
took this as part of his
research to figure out if he

00:46:20.311-->00:46:26.784
could expand that regenerative
capac- uh capacity beyond your
fingertips to the to other parts

00:46:26.784-->00:46:32.390
of your body. Uh he didn't win a
Nobel prize so I'll I guess it
didn't quite work as well as as

00:46:32.390-->00:46:37.128
we might hoped. But there
there's a tremendous amount of
work in that going on. >>Thank

00:46:37.128-->00:46:42.733
you >>We got time for one
more... >>Okay >>...question.
Sorry. >>Hey >>Ex- excellent

00:46:42.733-->00:46:47.138
talk, I just wanted to start by
thanking you for scaring the
ever loving s**t out of all of

00:46:47.138-->00:46:52.143
us.[applause] Umm because
frankly that needs to happen if
we're going to avoid this

00:46:55.780-->00:47:00.451
terrible future that you've
described. Crispr is the new kid
on the block but I think of

00:47:00.451-->00:47:04.655
Crisper as like a root kit
that's just really good at doing
advanced things but it's the

00:47:04.655-->00:47:10.094
spreading mechanism that frankly
mother nature has been giving us
for millennia that's the real

00:47:10.094-->00:47:15.099
problem to address. So my
question is umm are Intel or the
DoD or other organizations that

00:47:17.635-->00:47:22.306
have the resources to tackle
this developing the equivalent
of biological intrusion

00:47:22.306-->00:47:27.311
detection systems that can
sample airborne or or human
spreading epidemics through

00:47:29.547-->00:47:35.252
urban population centers to very
quickly identify that spreading
vehicle? >>So that's a great

00:47:35.252-->00:47:40.825
question. Umm there there's sort
of 2 mechanisms one is the
science of epidemiology which

00:47:40.825-->00:47:45.830
I've already talked about and of
course that is limited uh you
know it started in the ss- 1700s

00:47:47.932-->00:47:54.672
or 1800s and we still use the
basic same mechanisms. Um on the
technology side the Centers for

00:47:54.672-->00:47:59.677
Disease Control has something
called a biowatch program which
is these today these big carts

00:48:01.879-->00:48:07.485
umm so the San Francisco uh San
Francisco area hosted the super
bowl last year and on the

00:48:07.485-->00:48:12.823
sidewalks in San Francisco these
carts appeared and they have you
know sort of a smoke stack and

00:48:12.823-->00:48:18.129
they basically sniff the air and
they bring the air into the
business part of the cart and

00:48:18.129-->00:48:24.168
with today's technology it's
just deposited there and a human
comes by, picks up the samples,

00:48:24.168-->00:48:30.441
takes 'em back to a lab and does
some PCR some genetic analysis
on it. So the CDC tried to

00:48:30.441-->00:48:35.446
develop a ss-second generation
of this cart and the program was
not successful. And so right now

00:48:38.115-->00:48:43.120
it's in hold as to what to do.
Umm you know my idea is that umm
when you go into an emergency

00:48:47.591-->00:48:53.264
room and they draw some blood
from you and send it for the
lab, the blood in that tube uh

00:48:53.264-->00:48:59.370
90 percent of it is thrown away
cause it's more than they need.
So why not take that blood and

00:48:59.370-->00:49:04.308
throw it into a big vat and once
a day just sequence the crap out
of all that blood that comes in

00:49:06.310-->00:49:11.315
and send that immense amount of
data down to the CDC in Atlanta
and that would give them really

00:49:13.684-->00:49:19.857
I think a national picture in
real time of what's coming into
the emergency room at a genetic

00:49:19.857-->00:49:25.262
level. So I I think that would
be kind of a first step on um a
new generation of bio

00:49:25.262-->00:49:30.267
surveillance. >>Uh one one for
you this is quick. Is it lupus?
>>Ha ha ha ha. It's never lupus.

00:49:42.713-->00:49:46.350
[applause] >>Yes! [audience
laughs] [applause]
