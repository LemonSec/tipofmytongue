00:00:00.100-->00:00:05.806
>>Yeah we're long time Def Con
listeners, first time Def Con
talkers >>Yeah >>So I like that-

00:00:05.806-->00:00:12.012
that our slides are cut off
cause it just says the internet
already knows I'm x and you can

00:00:12.012-->00:00:18.085
fill in the blank um in this
case it's pregnant um but that's
historical I'm wasn't drinking

00:00:18.085-->00:00:23.090
while pregnant, just so you know
[laughter] So I'm Kashmir, I'm a
journalist, I've been writing

00:00:25.359-->00:00:30.831
about privacy and security for
about ten years and I'm a new
mother which is relevant

00:00:30.831-->00:00:36.036
information at this particular
time >>Uh and I'm Cooper, I'm a
technologist and security

00:00:36.036-->00:00:41.875
researcher at EFF uh I'm a
privacy activist and I also care
about privacy and security

00:00:41.875-->00:00:46.546
issues for people that have
wombs despite not having one
myself >>Woo! Yeah! [applause]

00:00:46.546-->00:00:51.551
>>Uh so we paired up for this
particular project um I I'm an
investigative journalist so I'm

00:00:55.822-->00:01:00.761
good at reading documents, and
talking to people, and I'm also
an immersion journalist, I like

00:01:03.130-->00:01:06.466
doing the things I'm writing
about so when I wrote about
bitcoin I lived on bitcoin for a

00:01:06.466-->00:01:11.471
week, it was hard um in the past
with Def Con speakers help I
hacked a smart home um so yeah I

00:01:13.774-->00:01:17.010
like to do the things I'm
writing about though I did not
get pregnant just to do this

00:01:17.010-->00:01:22.015
talk [laughter] >>Uh and I
didn't either. So uh I'm a
hacker so my skillset involves

00:01:25.118-->00:01:30.123
apparently seeing dogs and
blondes in the matrix um but uh
uh so I got interested in this

00:01:32.726-->00:01:37.731
um originally I ha- when I had
um advised another journalist on
an article about anti-abortion

00:01:40.267-->00:01:46.707
groups using uh geo targeting
advertisements to target
anti-abortion ads at women

00:01:46.707-->00:01:50.610
inside of Planned Parenthoods.
>>So you'd be in Planned
Parenthood planning to get an

00:01:50.610-->00:01:54.948
abortion, you fire up Facebook,
and you get an ad telling you
that you're- you know killing

00:01:54.948-->00:01:59.953
your fetus. >>Yeah. And so uh I
met Kashmir and she uh pitched
this idea to me um after uh she

00:02:02.489-->00:02:07.828
had unsuccessfully looked for a
real security researcher for
many months um and we settled on

00:02:07.828-->00:02:12.833
me so uh >>And beyond being
pregnant I got interested in
this um a few years ago I uh

00:02:15.635-->00:02:20.207
we're on the wrong slide, next
one, oh we are missing the
slide, anyways, a few years ago

00:02:20.207-->00:02:25.212
I helped popularize the story of
uh the Target story. Um doe- is
there anyone in here who doesn't

00:02:28.081-->00:02:32.419
know the Target data mining
pregnancy story? Don't be afraid
to raise your hands. Okay I'll

00:02:32.419-->00:02:37.224
tell it. Um almost everyone
seems to know this story and I
hear it come up at every single

00:02:37.224-->00:02:40.894
security conference, privacy
security conference I go to so
I'll be the one to raise it this

00:02:40.894-->00:02:45.799
time. But this is a story that
came from an article written by
Charles Duhigg who is a New York

00:02:45.799-->00:02:50.904
Times journalist um he did this
big article on how companies
learn your secrets and one of

00:02:50.904-->00:02:57.277
the anecdotes in this story was
that Target did really excellent
data mining, it would look at uh

00:02:57.277-->00:03:01.681
the shopping behavior of women
to figure out who who- early on
who is pregnant and it would be

00:03:01.681-->00:03:05.852
like they bought unscented
lotion, they bought a blue
carpet, they probably bought

00:03:05.852-->00:03:11.925
prenatal vitamins, which is like
the big give away uh and so
there was this story about how

00:03:11.925-->00:03:17.330
Target sent ads to this woman
for all kinds of baby products
and it turned out this woman was

00:03:17.330-->00:03:22.335
a teenager and her dad saw the
ads and got really mad and went
to Target and and was yelling at

00:03:22.335-->00:03:27.007
them saying are you trying to
encourage my daughter to get
pregnant and supposedly this dad

00:03:27.007-->00:03:31.845
called Target back a couple of
weeks later and apologized and
said there were things going on

00:03:31.845-->00:03:36.850
in his home uh that he didn't
know about and that his daughter
was indeed pregnant. So some

00:03:39.386-->00:03:44.724
people don't want uh the
internet to know about their
pregnancy um in particular

00:03:44.724-->00:03:48.628
there's a Princeton professor
named Janet Vertesi and she
wanted while she was pregnant

00:03:48.628-->00:03:54.568
for the internet not to find out
about it. So she went to great
lengths to hide her baby bump

00:03:54.568-->00:04:01.074
from the world of big data. She
looked at baby sites, baby
product sites, using Tor uh her

00:04:01.074-->00:04:07.614
husband went to uh the drug
store, paid cash for gift cards
when they wanted to buy baby

00:04:07.614-->00:04:12.452
products they would do it with
these gift cards and have it
sent to an Amazon locker so it

00:04:12.452-->00:04:17.758
wasn't associated with their
home address and um she said she
successfully hid it as far as

00:04:17.758-->00:04:22.662
she could tell because she never
got online ads um uh targeted at
her based on her pregnancy. I

00:04:22.662-->00:04:28.201
decided to do the opposite. I
just told everybody I was
pregnant [chuckles] I downloaded

00:04:28.201-->00:04:32.272
while I was trying to get
pregnant, downloaded all of
these period and fertility

00:04:32.272-->00:04:37.077
tracking apps and then once I
got pregnant I entered into the
apps I was pregnant and I just

00:04:37.077-->00:04:41.681
used an email address that I- I
don't usually use in order to
track what happened cause I

00:04:41.681-->00:04:47.120
wanted to find out who was going
to sell me out to retailers who
was gonna figure out that uh I

00:04:47.120-->00:04:52.726
was expecting. >>So uh this is
the list of apps that we looked
at uh and we looked at about err

00:04:52.726-->00:04:58.231
a little over 20 different apps
um and they have all of these
names a lot of them are named

00:04:58.231-->00:05:04.171
similar things like my calendar,
my time, um [sighs] and uh >>So
here's the first privacy issue

00:05:04.171-->00:05:09.976
>>Yeah so >>Once you put this on
your phone and somebody is
shoulder surfing, do they know

00:05:09.976-->00:05:14.848
what you're doing with these
apps? >>So there's one set of
logos that are very discreet,

00:05:14.848-->00:05:19.586
like you know, letters, numbers,
this could all be pretty generic
applications, ridesharing or

00:05:19.586-->00:05:25.325
something, there's the next tier
though that involves a lot pink
flowers and silhouettes of women

00:05:25.325-->00:05:30.764
>>I've never had so much pink on
my smartphone [laughter] >>Uh
and then there's yet a third

00:05:30.764-->00:05:35.769
tier of weird images of fetuses
[laughter] >>At least the last
one doesn't give away what the-

00:05:37.938-->00:05:43.777
the sex is of the baby >>And
then of course the grand winner
is this one [laughter] >>No I

00:05:43.777-->00:05:48.882
mean you don't necessarily know
what this is, it could be like a
porn app >>No, but it's called

00:05:48.882-->00:05:53.887
'Get Baby' [laughter] so yeah a
little on the nose for this one.
Um >>So I think that there's

00:05:57.691-->00:06:03.029
probably a few dudes in the
audience who maybe haven't used
these apps before and you may

00:06:03.029-->00:06:06.967
wonder why it is that women
would want to tell their smart
phone uh when they're having

00:06:06.967-->00:06:11.538
their period uh so these are
some of the reasons why women
use these apps uh the screenshot

00:06:11.538-->00:06:18.178
on the left you can't quite see
it, but it give you options for
for why you're using the app, it

00:06:18.178-->00:06:22.449
can be that you're trying to
avoid pregnancy. So some women
are using this as a

00:06:22.449-->00:06:28.655
contraceptive to avoid uh I
guess the sperm getting to the
egg during a fertile period. Um

00:06:28.655-->00:06:34.527
using it to get pregnant, or if
they're getting very expensive
IVF treatments, they can use

00:06:34.527-->00:06:39.833
these apps to track what's going
on with their body. Uh once you
get pregnant you can use these

00:06:39.833-->00:06:46.306
apps to track the human science
experiment that's inside you uh
the the main thing that the apps

00:06:46.306-->00:06:52.412
tell you about is what size
fruit the fetus is in your body
[laughter] which is super weird.

00:06:52.412-->00:06:57.817
>>Uh one of them told us that
the baby was the size of a
cheesy mango [laughter] which

00:06:57.817-->00:07:02.689
I'm not clear what a cheesy
mango is >>[laughs] and it told
us, it was not our- it was not

00:07:02.689-->00:07:07.694
our baby [laughter] >>No, no,
yeah, [laughter] we should
clarify >>[laughs] and then the

00:07:09.763-->00:07:15.568
other use for these apps is they
have these community forums
where women um talk about all

00:07:15.568-->00:07:20.674
kinds of things sometimes it's
stuff having to do with
pregnancy and fertility uh

00:07:20.674-->00:07:24.744
sometimes it's completely
different, there's a lot of
discussion about people's sex

00:07:24.744-->00:07:30.583
lives uh in the screenshots I
have here it's about I can't
even remember oh baby bump

00:07:30.583-->00:07:35.488
selfies, those are really big,
oh there's somebody saying why
is my period greenish black,

00:07:35.488-->00:07:41.494
which you should probably get
out of the forums and go to the
doctor [laughter] and then in

00:07:41.494-->00:07:46.333
terms to the kind of information
that you give these apps um you
might tell them what your

00:07:46.333-->00:07:51.304
vaginal discharge looks like um
you'll because their fertility
apps a very important piece of

00:07:51.304-->00:07:55.942
information is how often you're
having sex and when you're
having sex. Once you're pregnant

00:07:55.942-->00:08:00.413
you might tell them the physical
symptoms that you're
experiencing from you know

00:08:00.413-->00:08:06.953
headaches to back aches to not
sleeping a lot uh and then the
apps are helpful in terms of

00:08:06.953-->00:08:09.489
getting you to do things that
you're supposed to do when
you're pregnant like take

00:08:09.489-->00:08:14.594
prenatal envir- uh prenatal
vitamins, do kegels , which if
you don't know what that is you

00:08:14.594-->00:08:19.099
can look it up up [laughs] and
just track your sleep and your
weight like the usual kind of

00:08:19.099-->00:08:24.104
health tracking stuff. So I
downloaded all these apps um who
figured out I was pregnant? So

00:08:26.806-->00:08:32.846
one of the first uh one of the
companies that figured out I was
pregnant um was Twitter so this

00:08:32.846-->00:08:37.851
is from a uh a Twitter account
that is associated with the
email address that I used with

00:08:40.186-->00:08:44.457
all of these different apps and
I don't know if it's included in
the screenshots but they figured

00:08:44.457-->00:08:49.696
out that um this is from there's
like a an interests page that
you can get to in your Twitter

00:08:49.696-->00:08:54.167
settings and it tell you with
like what advertisers know about
you, how they're targeting you

00:08:54.167-->00:08:59.539
so I have been uh successfully
associated with baby products,
childcare products, and very

00:08:59.539-->00:09:04.477
specifically it says, dem- in my
demographic information that I
have one child. Which is true.

00:09:06.846-->00:09:12.552
Also all of these people figured
out I was pregnant. Um this is
my inbox at six months and um

00:09:12.552-->00:09:19.359
luckily again I was not using my
usual email address uh but I had
ads from pottery barn kids, uh

00:09:19.359-->00:09:24.364
What to Expect which is one of
the apps I signed up for,
Huggies and many many more. So

00:09:27.467-->00:09:32.505
this is where we get into my
specialty um of reading
documents so I wanted to figure

00:09:32.505-->00:09:37.377
out you know how these people
had gotten this information, uh
there was a technical way to fi-

00:09:37.377-->00:09:43.249
find that out and then there was
just a read the privacy policy
way so one of the uh- and I- I'm

00:09:43.249-->00:09:49.289
only going to be give you a few
of the privacy policies but the
first one was What to Expect.

00:09:49.289-->00:09:54.761
This privacy policy is 4
thousand words long which is 8
pages if you print it out, and

00:09:54.761-->00:10:01.534
2600 words in it very explicitly
says you know we when you sign
up we give your registration

00:10:01.534-->00:10:06.906
information to select partners
and there's a little link there
that you can click and then it

00:10:06.906-->00:10:12.145
gives you a list of the partners
um when I first did this it was
like 8 different companies but

00:10:12.145-->00:10:18.551
when I went back to the
screenshots for our talk it had
expanded to I think 14 um it

00:10:18.551-->00:10:23.590
includes pottery barn kids,
huggies, uh, some of the people
that you saw spamming my inbox,

00:10:23.590-->00:10:28.328
and the privacy policy said, if
you don't want us to tell these
companies about your- your

00:10:28.328-->00:10:33.333
pregnancy status uh don't use
the app. Uh you know this can be
worse than just getting spam in

00:10:36.236-->00:10:41.241
your inbox uh sometimes they
send real mail uh similac is a
baby formula maker and they're

00:10:43.610-->00:10:49.082
one of What to Expect's select
partners and uh so they get
information from What to Expect

00:10:49.082-->00:10:55.021
and other um companies that they
wouldn't disclose to me uh and
they will send a woman baby

00:10:55.021-->00:10:59.826
formula a couple of weeks before
her due date so that she
helpfully has baby formula

00:10:59.826-->00:11:04.764
around to feed to her child uh
this can go very wrong because
not everyone who gets pregnant

00:11:07.000-->00:11:13.606
stays pregnant so in one
particular example a woman named
Amy Pitman from Washington got

00:11:13.606-->00:11:18.745
pregnant, was excited about it,
put it into the apps, um she
didn't like the What to Expect

00:11:18.745-->00:11:23.750
app so she deleted it, and then
she had a miscarriage, and uh a
few months later, or I guess

00:11:26.252-->00:11:32.659
like 8 months later, she did get
baby formula in the mail. So
there is serious privacy harms

00:11:32.659-->00:11:38.164
here when you miss identify or
correctly identify a woman's
condition but then don't know

00:11:38.164-->00:11:42.368
what happens later. >>And it
seems like a lot of these apps
are not keeping in mind people

00:11:42.368-->00:11:48.074
who might be outside of the
majority use case the average
users story or the average

00:11:48.074-->00:11:52.946
threat model so to speak which
is a theme that'll come up again
>>Okay, so privacy policy number

00:11:52.946-->00:11:57.951
2, this was The Bump uh this
privacy policy was 4700 words
which is 10 pages printed out

00:12:00.086-->00:12:04.591
>>Yeah and so for reference,
this is the same length as the
entire report that I wrote about

00:12:04.591-->00:12:09.596
this problem >>[laughs] And so I
was reading this privacy policy
and I was really surprised to

00:12:11.598-->00:12:18.338
get about halfway through it and
I discovered baby's first
wiretap. Which [laughs] which I

00:12:18.338-->00:12:21.708
use facetiously I don't know if
a lawyer would approve of
calling this explicitly a

00:12:21.708-->00:12:27.981
wiretap but [laughs] it had a
feature um it re- it told you
that if you made a call from

00:12:27.981-->00:12:34.320
within the app like you um
identified a vendor that you
wanted to do your baby registry

00:12:34.320-->00:12:39.325
on. If you made a call from the
app it would record the call um
it would record any message that

00:12:42.128-->00:12:47.267
you left, it would um collect
the phone number, the location
where you were when you made the

00:12:47.267-->00:12:51.971
call, etcetera, which I just
thought was insane, like I've
never seen anything like that

00:12:51.971-->00:12:57.410
before with an app. And so I
called up, I- I reached out the
The Bump and I said you know,

00:12:57.410-->00:13:02.348
WTF. And they informed me oh you
know we're not recording phone
calls, that's legacy language

00:13:05.151-->00:13:11.291
for a contemplated future, for
the Knot which is an app that
they do uh for planning weddings

00:13:11.291-->00:13:17.397
and uh the press person was like
I'll send that to our legal team
right away eh so this proves

00:13:17.397-->00:13:22.802
that no one reads privacy
policies, not even a company's
own lawyers [laughter >>And the

00:13:22.802-->00:13:26.205
line >>They removed it from the
privacy policy a couple days
after I reached out to them

00:13:26.205-->00:13:32.845
>>The line of uh this bad thing
you found was was uh just a just
a test, how common was that

00:13:32.845-->00:13:36.516
>>Yeah I mean I'm sure of many
people out here who have reached
out to companies about privacy

00:13:36.516-->00:13:41.020
or security issues often gets a
response of it was just a test
or we were just temporarily

00:13:41.020-->00:13:45.124
doing it. I don't know I hear
that all the time. >>That was
response from about half of the

00:13:45.124-->00:13:50.129
companies we contacted I think.
>>Okay this is the last one. Um
so this was Ovia which is an app

00:13:52.732-->00:13:56.536
uh a company that makes a
fertility app, a pregnancy
tracking app, and even a child

00:13:56.536-->00:14:01.474
tracking app, their terms of use
um uh are 6100 words which is 14
pages printed out. Um I don't

00:14:04.210-->00:14:08.081
know if you can see it in the
screenshot but this is an app
that gives you like a really

00:14:08.081-->00:14:12.385
helpful fertility score like
your score is high, do it, your
score is low, nothing's gonna

00:14:12.385-->00:14:18.491
come of it [laughter] and
[laughs] when I went through
their terms of use they uh you

00:14:18.491-->00:14:23.496
know a lot of these apps they
sound like they're they're kind
of like giving you the kind of

00:14:23.496-->00:14:27.567
advice that a doctor might give
you um but many of the apps warn
that they're not really giving

00:14:27.567-->00:14:32.805
you medical advice and this one
explicitly said you know this
app might be- might have errors,

00:14:32.805-->00:14:38.411
may be inaccurate just so you
know we're not responsible for
that. So I went back to look at

00:14:38.411-->00:14:45.118
their website and um oh yeah you
can see it good. So in the
advertisement for their

00:14:45.118-->00:14:50.857
pregnancy app they said they'll
give you real time alerts when
your symptoms are dangerous and

00:14:50.857-->00:14:55.161
right above that is like the
little medical symbol. So I
don't know it sounds like

00:14:55.161-->00:15:00.967
medical advice to me. >>Sure
seem to be trying to imply that
it's medical advice. >>Right.,

00:15:00.967-->00:15:05.171
So these are some of the issues
that we ran into um when it
comes to inaccuracy the warning

00:15:05.171-->00:15:11.878
that they gave uh is warranted I
found out that a year ago th- uh
three doctors looked at a bunch

00:15:11.878-->00:15:18.151
of apps, 33 of the most popular
ones on Android and iphone uh
and they looked at their

00:15:18.151-->00:15:24.056
predictions for the fertile
window and of those 33 apps,
only 3 apps correctly predicted

00:15:24.056-->00:15:29.095
the fertile window um and we've
got their results there. No one
was completely off but they

00:15:29.095-->00:15:35.468
would just be off by like a few
days and um interestingly the
month that I got pregnant uh

00:15:35.468-->00:15:40.973
most of the apps told me I'd
missed my fertile window so uh
my husband and I were excited

00:15:40.973-->00:15:45.144
when we found out that in fact
it had worked. >>So if you're
using these to not get pregnant

00:15:45.144-->00:15:51.017
uh it might not be the best
method >>Yeah, please don't use
these apps as a contraceptive.

00:15:51.017-->00:15:56.222
Um so so far I've talked a lot
about a one person that's
involved in this in terms of

00:15:56.222-->00:16:02.862
privacy um there's- there's two
people involved and so that was
definitely on my mind as I was

00:16:02.862-->00:16:07.867
doing this project is that um
well basically I've- I was
tracking my now uh my now in the

00:16:12.772-->00:16:17.777
world daughter, online, since
she was negative 8 months old uh
[laughs] so I'm just wanted to

00:16:20.179-->00:16:25.184
say a public apology to Ellev.
>>uh >>So so that's like a lot
of what I was able to [laughter]

00:16:36.896-->00:16:41.901
[inaudible] [laughs] So this is
uh- this is what I was able to
learn just from um basically

00:16:45.905-->00:16:49.308
tapping into skills that I have
as a journalist in terms of
reviewing privacy policies,

00:16:49.308-->00:16:54.313
reaching out to companies, I
also used an a-um an um an an
app I guess called Recon from

00:16:56.482-->00:17:00.553
Northeastern University uh that
monitored the kind of
connections that my phone was

00:17:00.553-->00:17:05.424
trying to make and that these
apps in particular were trying
to make and so it told me

00:17:05.424-->00:17:09.195
essentially that there were a
lot of advertisers that were
getting information from the

00:17:09.195-->00:17:14.967
apps um but I felt like I needed
more help in terms of really
digging into the the the

00:17:14.967-->00:17:20.239
technical side of this and
that's where Cooper came in.
>>Yeah so I wanted to give sort

00:17:20.239-->00:17:25.278
of a hackers side of this and
see what we could find out about
uh the network traffic what was

00:17:25.278-->00:17:31.584
what sort of API calls were
being made, whether encryption
was being used, um, whether the

00:17:31.584-->00:17:36.722
APIs were written securely and
what- what other companies were
getting the data and what sort

00:17:36.722-->00:17:42.094
of data exactly they were
getting. So uh >>Also Cooper is
really good at finding memes

00:17:42.094-->00:17:47.466
[laughs] So you'll appreciate
the next few slides >>So um the-
one of the first fun things that

00:17:47.466-->00:17:53.272
I discovered about these apps is
that uh they- they give you some
pretty specific advice this one

00:17:53.272-->00:17:58.010
told me that I had a 2 point 6
percent risk for pregnancy,
which is large considering I

00:17:58.010-->00:18:03.249
again, don't have a womb
[laughter] >>So there is no
option in these apps to say I'm-

00:18:03.249-->00:18:10.222
I'm a dude >>Yeah [laughs] um no
so I used uh pretty typical
reverse engineering methods, uh

00:18:10.222-->00:18:15.895
static analysis, dynamic
analysis, uh and some other
tools um so for static analysis

00:18:15.895-->00:18:20.900
I used a tool called JADX which
is a decompiler for APK files uh
produces something close to the

00:18:24.470-->00:18:29.709
original java source code it
also uh extracts the resource
files uh and then I loaded that

00:18:29.709-->00:18:35.247
up in android studio where I was
able to do some similar things
like what you can do in Ida I

00:18:35.247-->00:18:41.354
was able to um rename function
calls that were obscured, track
flows of functions, see where

00:18:41.354-->00:18:46.092
permissions were called, why
they were called um so this gave
me a lot of good insights into

00:18:46.092-->00:18:50.663
apps that I wasn't able to get
just from network traffic um and
this is how I got network

00:18:50.663-->00:18:56.469
traffic so for dynamic analysis
I used a tool called man in the
middle proxy or MITM proxy um

00:18:56.469-->00:19:02.375
and what MITM proxy does is it
intercepts SSL traffic you uh
install a special root

00:19:02.375-->00:19:07.646
certificate on your device and
then you connect to the proxy
and you can see um content,

00:19:07.646-->00:19:12.818
headers, and everything else,
for HTTPS traffic and it also
allows you to replay requests,

00:19:12.818-->00:19:18.824
edit requests and replay them so
it was really good for uh
looking at the APIs figuring out

00:19:18.824-->00:19:23.829
who was being contacted and what
they were being sent. Uh and
then the other tool I used is a

00:19:23.829-->00:19:28.567
proprietary tool called
Kryptowire uh which they donated
their services to us for this

00:19:28.567-->00:19:35.408
project uh so Kryptowire it does
a combination of static and
dynamic analysis uh and it

00:19:35.408-->00:19:40.413
allowed me to quickly um w- to-
do sort of a quick triaging of
about 40 different apps uh in a

00:19:43.282-->00:19:48.687
couple of hours to see uh sort
of a high level overview of
which ones might be worth

00:19:48.687-->00:19:54.560
looking into further. Um and you
can see here this is kind of the
like high level analysis screen

00:19:54.560-->00:19:59.565
of one of the apps uh where it
told me that it was leaking uh
personal information um so yeah

00:20:02.068-->00:20:07.073
so one of the main things that I
found in most of these apps was
uh just lack of HTTPS um so

00:20:10.476-->00:20:16.215
meaning that content- important
personal content was sent over
plain text html >>And so you

00:20:16.215-->00:20:20.252
might wonder like okay we're
talking about the privacy and
security of fertility apps,

00:20:20.252-->00:20:25.458
who's gonna attack these things
like who wants to hack these, so
let's think about um what kind

00:20:25.458-->00:20:30.930
of information is going into
these apps, women talking about
their sex lives, um, or the

00:20:30.930-->00:20:35.201
kinds of things that they're
writing on the community forums
where they're talking about

00:20:35.201-->00:20:40.639
issues that they're having with
their pregnancy, medical
information, um, again a lo- a

00:20:40.639-->00:20:45.344
lot of them talking about their
sex lives, strangely a lot of
women talking about um their

00:20:45.344-->00:20:49.982
experiences being sexually
assaulted that was like a very
common um topic of conversation

00:20:49.982-->00:20:54.420
so this is all being sent in the
clear um and you might it might
be intercepted by somebody who

00:20:54.420-->00:21:00.126
shares uh a network with you
>>Yeah >>which could be your
partner, uh could be your

00:21:00.126-->00:21:05.131
restrictive father, uh thanks to
congress deciding not to move
forward with privacy rules for

00:21:07.967-->00:21:12.037
ISPs this means your internet
service provider could get this
information and this would be

00:21:12.037-->00:21:17.543
more uh more information used to
target you with ads. >>Yeah um
and then the other thing about

00:21:17.543-->00:21:22.314
this is of course that somebody
with man in the middle position
could inject uh an execute

00:21:22.314-->00:21:28.821
javascript on a lot of these
apps which used the uh web kit
framework to render pages um

00:21:28.821-->00:21:34.827
related to that uh we found a
number of issues with uh account
hijacking ala uh firesheep so

00:21:34.827-->00:21:39.798
four of these apps would have
been fire sheepable um so they
were- which is to say that they

00:21:39.798-->00:21:45.538
were sending authentication
cookies over plain text so Pink
Pad, Webmd Baby, My Calendar,

00:21:45.538-->00:21:50.709
and The Bump um all were found
to send authentication cookies
over plain text >>So >>The top

00:21:50.709-->00:21:55.714
three have not fixed this >>So
if you're using these apps and
you're using Def Con wifi don't

00:21:57.950-->00:22:02.154
do those things at the same time
>>yeah [laughter] probably just
don't use the wifi [laughter]

00:22:02.154-->00:22:07.159
even if you're not using these
apps. Uh we also found a lot of
personal information leaks. So

00:22:09.395-->00:22:14.400
uh for Pink Pad and another- uh
so Pink Pad is made by a company
called Alt12 we tested two of

00:22:16.769-->00:22:23.108
their apps uh and both of them
send your exact GPS coordinates
to the Alt12 server every time

00:22:23.108-->00:22:29.848
you start the app um and why the
hell does a period tracking app
need to know your location?

00:22:29.848-->00:22:33.552
[laughs] >>And it's in their
privacy policy it's so they can
provide you with location based

00:22:33.552-->00:22:38.557
information, and ads. Location
based ads. >>Yeah. uh so they-
we also found a number of other

00:22:40.726-->00:22:47.666
things like email, name, gender,
pregnancy status all being sent
and I don't think that Pink Pad

00:22:47.666-->00:22:51.971
was the only one that was
sending location uh a bunch of
these apps requested the

00:22:51.971-->00:22:56.442
location permission but what we
found w- uh through static
analysis was that a lot of them

00:22:56.442-->00:23:02.581
were encrypting the data that
was being sent uh to advertisers
and to other people, Pink Pad

00:23:02.581-->00:23:06.151
was just the most obvious about
it. And if we had more time
maybe we would have found

00:23:06.151-->00:23:09.989
others. >>And so again thinking
about the threat model here, I
actually want you to put on your

00:23:09.989-->00:23:14.994
William Gibson hats um and think
about the possibility for um
what what could be done with

00:23:17.796-->00:23:23.736
information about women planning
to be pregnant um or thinking
about pregnancy um who are

00:23:23.736-->00:23:28.274
giving up their location details
all the time um so I think at
the beginning of this talk we

00:23:28.274-->00:23:33.846
made the point that advertisers
um aren't just creepy because
they get a lot of information

00:23:33.846-->00:23:37.650
about you and they're trying to
get you to buy something um in
the case of knowing a woman's

00:23:37.650-->00:23:44.189
pregnancy uh status it can be
very malicious where we had an
anti-abortion group targeting

00:23:44.189-->00:23:50.029
women that are in a Planned
Parenthood waiting room so just
think about some kind of a

00:23:50.029-->00:23:56.302
policy group who wants to target
a bunch of women who live in a
certain neighborhood um and tell

00:23:56.302-->00:24:01.006
them that they shouldn't get
pregnant, like all everything
that's bad about it or try to

00:24:01.006-->00:24:04.510
encourage them to get pregnant.
>>And uh I don't know if Cory
Doctorow is in here but if you

00:24:04.510-->00:24:10.716
write this story, we want
royalties. [laughter] Um so uh
and there were other information

00:24:10.716-->00:24:16.355
leaks too like uh this text file
that was dropped on the SD card
by one of the apps so this

00:24:16.355-->00:24:21.360
contains a log of the entries
into the app every day uh and uh
j- January 18th was a uh >>Like

00:24:23.529-->00:24:30.102
a really good day [laughter]
>>But um this this this file
being on the SD card means that

00:24:30.102-->00:24:34.273
any other app could read this
file and furthermore it means
that anybody who gets ahold of

00:24:34.273-->00:24:38.210
your SD card or the data
partition on your phone is going
to be able to read this file as

00:24:38.210-->00:24:43.215
well. So it's a pretty big
privacy leak um and then of
course third party tracking is a

00:24:45.718-->00:24:50.689
super common problem with all of
these apps I think all but one
of the apps that we tested

00:24:50.689-->00:24:55.561
contacted several different
advertising servers um and it's
mostly the same stuff that you

00:24:55.561-->00:25:00.499
see online uh the majority of it
is Google, Facebook, um, Amazon,
and um A- Adobe's various

00:25:03.736-->00:25:08.607
publishing networks and then
there's like a long tail of uh
just random advertisers and data

00:25:08.607-->00:25:14.646
brokers uh that are you know on
one or two of them. >>So I think
it's safe to say that Google,

00:25:14.646-->00:25:20.552
Facebook, Amazon, and Adobe know
more about who in the- who in
the country is pregnant than

00:25:20.552-->00:25:25.557
Target >>So one feature that all
these- or that a lot of these
apps have in common is this pin

00:25:27.693-->00:25:33.065
lock screen um and it's kind of
interesting presumably to keep
somebody from just picking up

00:25:33.065-->00:25:37.870
your phone and looking at it uh
but they're not implemented very
well uh they almost all have a

00:25:37.870-->00:25:44.543
for- 4 digit limit um and at the
time that we looked at this none
of them had any sort of

00:25:44.543-->00:25:48.947
protections against brute
forcing so you could guess as
many times as you wanted without

00:25:48.947-->00:25:54.253
any sort of slow down uh when we
notified the companies one of
the companies P Tracker did

00:25:54.253-->00:25:59.825
actually uh decide to fix that
issue and implemented a uh back
off for the number of times that

00:25:59.825-->00:26:05.030
you could enter the pin code uh
but the other thing about these
is that they don't have any sort

00:26:05.030-->00:26:10.369
of- they're not any sort of
protection for the data at rest
so they don't encrypt the data

00:26:10.369-->00:26:15.140
in any way, they don't do
anything to actually protect it
on the drive, they're just a uh

00:26:15.140-->00:26:19.578
intent that you have- that
triggers before the app starts
so all you have to do is get

00:26:19.578-->00:26:25.784
around that somehow and one way
to get around that is to click
this link that says I forgot my

00:26:25.784-->00:26:30.789
code so for at least one app uh
The Bump when you click this
link it sends you an email with

00:26:33.192-->00:26:37.963
a code- with a temporary pin
code that will unlock the app
>>And and where do those- you

00:26:37.963-->00:26:42.401
know where does email tend to
go? >>And so email tends to go
to your phone so if >>So if

00:26:42.401-->00:26:47.372
you're on the phone trying to
get into the app and you can't
because there's a pin on it

00:26:47.372-->00:26:52.511
>>Just send the reset code and
uh check the email because you
already have the phone and there

00:26:52.511-->00:26:57.015
you go so >>And when I- when I
was using these apps I was not
using pin codes I wasn't

00:26:57.015-->00:27:03.355
particularly concerned about um
uh somebody getting into the
apps uh but if- but if somebody

00:27:03.355-->00:27:08.660
does feel a need to use the pin
they may have a very legitimate
reason like they're >>You may be

00:27:08.660-->00:27:14.233
in an abusive relationship, you
may be in a restrictive you know
or a religious household, or a

00:27:14.233-->00:27:17.135
religious society. >>They're
with somebody that they don't
want somebody who has access to

00:27:17.135-->00:27:22.374
their phone to have access to
their sex lives and so these
pins should be stronger. >>Yeah

00:27:22.374-->00:27:28.280
and if you're relying on this
pin code for security uh I don't
recommend it uh you- you should

00:27:28.280-->00:27:33.285
um take better- other steps. Uh
the other issue- another issue
we found was files not actually

00:27:35.554-->00:27:42.528
being deleted uh and so again we
only found this in The Bump but
this is also largely because we

00:27:42.528-->00:27:46.598
ran out of time to do this
research and this is probably an
issue in other apps. So what

00:27:46.598-->00:27:52.204
happened this case is that um
The Bump encourages you to
upload poto- photos of your

00:27:52.204-->00:27:58.277
pregnanc- of your pregnancy
progress. So a photo of your
belly, a photo of um your- uh

00:27:58.277-->00:28:01.547
ultrasound >>And so what happens
on a lot of these apps there's
actually some apps that

00:28:01.547-->00:28:05.717
explicitly discourage this and
say no posting any personal
information in the community

00:28:05.717-->00:28:10.722
forums um but I guess The Bump
didn't' have that prohibition so
a lot of women like to post the

00:28:10.722-->00:28:14.426
ultrasound and share it so you
can see the development of the
baby but ultrasound pictures

00:28:14.426-->00:28:19.197
usually have uh the mother's
full name, the hospital where
the ultrasound was taken, the

00:28:19.197-->00:28:25.037
date, so a lot um of sensitive
information so a woman might
post that to a community forum

00:28:25.037-->00:28:30.442
and then realize all that she
shared and delete it >>But when
you delete it it turns out that

00:28:30.442-->00:28:35.747
it simply unlinks the photo from
your account but doesn't
actually delete it from the CDN

00:28:35.747-->00:28:40.886
server that the photo was
uploaded to. So if you have that
original URL that URL still

00:28:40.886-->00:28:46.658
works to see the photo for the
rest of time um and we thought
this might be a caching issue at

00:28:46.658-->00:28:52.364
first but the photo was still up
for a week after I had deleted
it from my account so definitely

00:28:52.364-->00:28:57.869
not a caching issue, just not
even considered that a user
might want to actually delete

00:28:57.869-->00:29:02.808
things when they say delete. Uh
and then uh the other thing we
found was just a crazy amount of

00:29:05.444-->00:29:09.247
permissions being requested uh
it seems like the Android
development philosophy is it's

00:29:09.247-->00:29:14.019
better to ask for all the
permissions than for any
forgiveness. Um no that was bad

00:29:14.019-->00:29:20.759
alright um so locat- so ten
different apps, half of the apps
we tested requested the location

00:29:20.759-->00:29:25.897
permission and again >>Everybody
wants to know where you are when
you're pregnant >>So again, for

00:29:25.897-->00:29:30.435
advertising right? But this
harkens back to the story that I
was working on earlier about uh

00:29:30.435-->00:29:34.673
women being targeted in Planned
Parenthoods through location
based advertising. This is

00:29:34.673-->00:29:40.345
incredibly personal information
and there's no reason that any
of these apps should have this.

00:29:40.345-->00:29:46.184
Um also a quarter of the apps we
tested requested your contact
list >>Just in case they wanna

00:29:46.184-->00:29:49.855
like inform people about the
pregnancy >>Yeah they might want
to text everybody you know that

00:29:49.855-->00:29:56.695
you're period is coming up.
[laughter] um also five or six
of the apps requested your

00:29:56.695-->00:30:03.235
device ID which is like a uh
cookie for your phone it lets
advertisers uh link your uh

00:30:03.235-->00:30:08.206
profile between different apps
um and then the phone permission
let's them do the same thing but

00:30:08.206-->00:30:13.578
using your IMEI which is like a
hardware serial number for your
phone. Um and then Pregnancy

00:30:13.578-->00:30:19.651
Plus requested the SMS
permission and I have no idea
why but it also has the contact

00:30:19.651-->00:30:24.456
permission so maybe that thing I
said earlier about it texting
everyone [laughter] anyway the

00:30:24.456-->00:30:29.461
other interesting uh so we found
one interesting security feature
was that four of these apps,

00:30:31.997-->00:30:37.002
Glow, Nurture, and Eve were all
made by the same company and
Clue all implement certificate

00:30:39.538-->00:30:44.543
pinning uh so this is where you
hardcode the hash of the SSL
certificate that you want to use

00:30:47.846-->00:30:52.918
for your uh HTTPS connection
into the application um and it's
pretty cool this- so this

00:30:52.918-->00:30:58.690
prevents somebody from doing a
man in the middle attack on
HTTPS like what I did with MITM

00:30:58.690-->00:31:05.030
proxy um and I mean it's a nice
feature to have my bank doesn't
even do this which would be

00:31:05.030-->00:31:10.102
great um but it's kind of extra
like I don't >>We're not- We're
not security shaming >>I'm not

00:31:10.102-->00:31:15.107
security shaming, I'm glad they
did it, but uh TLS man in the
middle seems like to not really

00:31:17.476-->00:31:22.481
be in the threat model for uh
the use of these apps and it
seems like maybe a better use of

00:31:22.481-->00:31:26.885
their time would be to implement
something like two factor
authentication uh which none of

00:31:26.885-->00:31:31.890
these apps did or securing that
pin code thing. S- um so after
finding all this uh we reached

00:31:35.727-->00:31:39.030
out to the- so we reached out to
the vendors separately >>We
reached out separately >>Yeah,

00:31:39.030-->00:31:43.568
so Kashmir reached out to them
about the uh privacy issues and
about the things in the um terms

00:31:43.568-->00:31:47.906
of service. I reached out to
them about the security issues
um this is how I felt about

00:31:47.906-->00:31:52.911
their response [laughter] um and
this- this this dog will always
be relevant forever [laughter]

00:31:55.580-->00:32:00.519
uh so I contacted uh nine
different vendors um and uh all
these guys and also The Bump um

00:32:02.754-->00:32:07.759
and we received a response back
from P Tracker, Glow, and The
Bump which isn't up there

00:32:09.995-->00:32:15.000
because we got a response back
from them uh just- just after we
finished these slides. Um who-

00:32:17.602-->00:32:23.241
so P Tracker and Glow fixed the
issues that we found uh The Bump
promised that they would fix the

00:32:23.241-->00:32:28.847
issues um and everyone else just
completely ignored us once
company sent us a form letter

00:32:28.847-->00:32:35.387
saying they- they appreciate
that we like their application
[laughter] >>I had a different

00:32:35.387-->00:32:40.759
experience and this is where
it's just is different being uh
a security uh technologist

00:32:40.759-->00:32:46.932
versus being a journalist. I
heard back from everybody that I
reached out to um except for

00:32:46.932-->00:32:52.137
Everyday Health um which makes
the What to Expect app and Alt12
uh and people you know

00:32:52.137-->00:32:54.139
acknowledged the problems with
uh the privacy policy and
changed it um I just- I got

00:32:54.139-->00:32:56.141
responses and uh companies
definitely seem to pay attention
to journalists I think that it

00:32:56.141-->00:32:58.143
helps that they like press
people set up particularly to
receive our um our inquiries and

00:32:58.143-->00:33:00.078
also I think they better
understand what journalists are
asking them and sometimes they

00:33:00.078-->00:33:02.080
just have no idea um what a
security technologist is sending
their way. >>So maybe the lesson

00:33:02.080-->00:33:07.085
here is that if you want
companies to take your security
issues seriously either work

00:33:10.922-->00:33:15.927
with a journalist or tell them
that you're a journalist >>Yeah,
I definitely endorse this pair

00:33:24.803-->00:33:31.409
up you should definitely pair up
with journalists if you're a
technologist and vice versa.

00:33:31.409-->00:33:38.149
>>Um yeah so and on that line uh
what can hackers do, what can
you all do uh to improve this

00:33:38.149-->00:33:43.154
situation and one of the best
things to do um is uh to pair up
with a journalist and I might do

00:33:45.423-->00:33:49.628
these in kind of a reverse
order- is to pair up with a
journalist uh the combination of

00:33:49.628-->00:33:55.233
a hacker and an investigative
journalist is a really powerful
combination um you can- we can

00:33:55.233-->00:34:01.573
find these problems and then we
can tell the world um and we can
through shaming these companies,

00:34:01.573-->00:34:07.445
and through getting this
publicity out there, convince
them to take these security and

00:34:07.445-->00:34:12.217
privacy issues more seriously.
Um and we're also- hackers are
really good at threat modeling

00:34:12.217-->00:34:17.422
and we can think about uh threat
models outside of sort of one's
standard deviation from the

00:34:17.422-->00:34:22.627
average user so we can think
about threat models for people
that are in abusive household or

00:34:22.627-->00:34:27.565
people that have a stalker,
right? These uh should be pretty
common threat models for

00:34:27.565-->00:34:31.369
somebody writing one of these
apps but they're apparently not
>>I think one thing that was

00:34:31.369-->00:34:34.539
obvious to us at the end of this
is that people that these
companies hadn't necessarily

00:34:34.539-->00:34:40.845
thought about um kind of the
abusive edge cases um and
actually a year ago Glow had a

00:34:40.845-->00:34:45.884
really big security issue that
consumer reports discovered
where Glow had this feature

00:34:45.884-->00:34:50.422
there where you could invite
your partner um to kind of
monitor your fertility or

00:34:50.422-->00:34:56.127
pregnancy with you and the way
they had set it up was such that
the woman um would would uh make

00:34:56.127-->00:35:02.734
the invitation to somebody but
um after she did that anybody
who knew her email address could

00:35:02.734-->00:35:08.073
then monitor um what she was
doing within the apps and so it
was just this kind of huge

00:35:08.073-->00:35:11.843
security hole and only
discovered because consumer
reports decided to look really

00:35:11.843-->00:35:16.214
closely at the- at the app.
>>But Glow did take that issue
seriously and did fix the issue

00:35:16.214-->00:35:21.219
and had- I think is why they
were so responsive to the
security issues that we found

00:35:21.219-->00:35:25.790
because they do seem to after
that shaming er after that
publicity >>publicity [laughs]

00:35:25.790-->00:35:29.361
not shame >>Not shaming um but
after that publicity they
decided to take these issues

00:35:29.361-->00:35:34.366
seriously so this is a great
illustration of how publicizing
these problems um is a effective

00:35:39.704-->00:35:44.309
tactic for change. >>Um >>So
Kashmir what was your takeaway
from all of this? >>Yeah I mean

00:35:44.309-->00:35:50.315
my firsthand um opinion on all
this like I hate to admit it but
I really enjoyed using these

00:35:50.315-->00:35:55.320
apps um while while I was
pregnant um it's super weird
being pregnant uh it's like

00:35:57.722-->00:36:02.360
unlike anything that's ever
happened to your body before and
you- just- you feel like a

00:36:02.360-->00:36:07.298
science experiment for 9 months
and so I appreciate the
information I was getting from

00:36:07.298-->00:36:12.437
the apps uh but if I decide to
have more children I don't think
I would use the apps again cause

00:36:12.437-->00:36:17.842
now I kinda like know my way
around it um so any any future
children I would have the only

00:36:17.842-->00:36:23.148
priv- privacy invasion they'd be
subjected to in utero would be
the ultrasound which I like to

00:36:23.148-->00:36:26.851
call baby's first privacy
invasion. >>It's always hardest
on the first child isn't it

00:36:26.851-->00:36:31.589
Kashmir? >>Always hard- we're
both first children, it's the
hardest. >>Anyway um and so

00:36:31.589-->00:36:36.161
that's all we have. We wanna say
some thanks to- uh thanks to
Kryptowire for donating their

00:36:36.161-->00:36:40.965
analysis services to us uh we
really appreciated that and it
helped us out. >>Thanks to J-

00:36:40.965-->00:36:45.937
Dave and Jingjing at
Northeastern for their help with
Recon >>and uh thanks to Gizmodo

00:36:45.937-->00:36:50.308
and EFF for continuing to sign
paychecks to us >>[laughs]
Thanks to Def Con and then

00:36:50.308-->00:36:55.313
thanks to Ellev for inspiring
our research [applause]
