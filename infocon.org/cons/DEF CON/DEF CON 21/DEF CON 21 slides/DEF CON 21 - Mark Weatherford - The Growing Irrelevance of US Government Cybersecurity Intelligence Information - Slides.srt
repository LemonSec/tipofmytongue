1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,999
I said I was going to call this "Information Sharing Is

2
00:00:02,999 --> 00:00:06,542
Broken," but I figured there would be about three or four people show

3
00:00:06,542 --> 00:00:10,792
up so I decided to make it sound a little bit more provocative.

4
00:00:11,083 --> 00:00:15,209
One of the Cardinal Rules of public speaking is never apologize.

5
00:00:15,375 --> 00:00:17,751
Well, I'm going to break that right now.

6
00:00:17,792 --> 00:00:21,999
I had a irrecoverable hardware failure last night, so we have no slides,

7
00:00:21,999 --> 00:00:26,000
so which means you only have to listen to me.

8
00:00:26,375 --> 00:00:29,250
So I'll try to be as entertaining as possible.

9
00:00:31,751 --> 00:00:35,834
I'm always a little bit anxious, but I'm also very appreciative when I'm

10
00:00:35,834 --> 00:00:38,918
talking with an audience of my peers.

11
00:00:38,999 --> 00:00:41,417
Usually many of you you can put your hand

12
00:00:41,417 --> 00:00:46,167
down now know more about some of this stuff than I do, so feel free

13
00:00:46,167 --> 00:00:49,626
to interject as we go along here.

14
00:00:50,209 --> 00:00:53,584
I don't think I'm going to break any new ground here today.

15
00:00:53,584 --> 00:00:54,999
I'm probably going to pull together

16
00:00:54,999 --> 00:00:58,999
a few things that people have thought about kind of independently,

17
00:00:58,999 --> 00:01:03,501
and what I really want to do is provoke a conversation.

18
00:01:03,918 --> 00:01:06,999
When I spoke here last year, some of you may remember I did a keynote,

19
00:01:06,999 --> 00:01:10,250
but I was a fed at the time, so I was a little bit restricted

20
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:13,584
on what I could say and how I could say it.

21
00:01:13,999 --> 00:01:15,250
This year I'm not.

22
00:01:15,459 --> 00:01:16,999
And I'm not.

23
00:01:18,083 --> 00:01:19,542
(Applause).

24
00:01:20,792 --> 00:01:23,999
But I'm also not here to bash the government and poke anyone

25
00:01:23,999 --> 00:01:25,501
in the eye.

26
00:01:25,501 --> 00:01:29,167
I have a lot of great friends in the government, at the US CERT,

27
00:01:29,167 --> 00:01:32,083
the NCIC and the other government agencies,

28
00:01:32,083 --> 00:01:36,250
and they work very, very hard just like most of you do, a lot

29
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:41,626
of time without a lot of the accolades that go along with that.

30
00:01:41,626 --> 00:01:43,667
So I'm not going to poke my former colleagues

31
00:01:43,667 --> 00:01:45,667
in the eye there.

32
00:01:46,375 --> 00:01:49,417
And I'm not going to get close to crossing any lines

33
00:01:49,417 --> 00:01:53,083
because I know there's people out there taking notes to poke me

34
00:01:53,083 --> 00:01:56,999
in the eye with my own words if I do cross that line, so I'm going

35
00:01:56,999 --> 00:01:58,834
to avoid that.

36
00:01:59,751 --> 00:02:02,999
When the title of my presentation was published,

37
00:02:02,999 --> 00:02:06,292
a few people called me to ask me if I wanted to talk

38
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:08,999
about this issue now that the Snowden and

39
00:02:08,999 --> 00:02:11,999
the prison thing came up, and actually I was

40
00:02:11,999 --> 00:02:15,626
a little surprised about it because that's not what I'm

41
00:02:15,626 --> 00:02:17,542
talking about.

42
00:02:17,709 --> 00:02:21,834
In fact, it's the farthest thing from what I'm talking about.

43
00:02:22,125 --> 00:02:26,584
What I want to talk about today is the kind of defensive analysis,

44
00:02:26,584 --> 00:02:30,792
the counter measures and signatures that each of you are doing,

45
00:02:30,792 --> 00:02:33,083
developing within your own companies

46
00:02:33,083 --> 00:02:35,999
and sharing with each other every single day

47
00:02:35,999 --> 00:02:39,125
without the help of the government assisting you

48
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:41,083
in doing that.

49
00:02:41,083 --> 00:02:44,459
I noted that's one of the roles of the government, but that's really

50
00:02:44,459 --> 00:02:48,209
the context of what I want to talk about today.

51
00:02:48,751 --> 00:02:52,667
And I'll tell you, I don't pretend to have all the answers here either.

52
00:02:52,709 --> 00:02:55,542
As I said, I want to provoke a conversation.

53
00:02:55,709 --> 00:03:00,999
And as I started putting this thing together, I canvassed a bunch

54
00:03:00,999 --> 00:03:06,209
of my colleagues and the general consensus is this is, in fact,

55
00:03:06,209 --> 00:03:10,167
a conversation that needs to happen.

56
00:03:10,167 --> 00:03:13,999
I know General Alexander said that very same thing at Black Hat

57
00:03:13,999 --> 00:03:17,999
during his keynote, but this is a different issue as far

58
00:03:17,999 --> 00:03:20,167
as I'm concerned.

59
00:03:20,209 --> 00:03:23,667
So I could ask you for a show of hands to see who

60
00:03:23,667 --> 00:03:29,083
in here thinks classified government information is of any value, and

61
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:32,959
since probably most of you have never had access

62
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:38,792
to or seen classified information, it wouldn't really be you wouldn't know

63
00:03:38,792 --> 00:03:42,709
if it was of any value to you or not.

64
00:03:43,501 --> 00:03:47,083
And I talked to a few of my friends, and several people asked me why

65
00:03:47,083 --> 00:03:49,125
I thought the government cyber security

66
00:03:49,125 --> 00:03:53,792
intelligence was of any value to the private sector to begin with.

67
00:03:53,999 --> 00:03:56,751
I thought that was kind of an interesting response.

68
00:03:56,751 --> 00:03:59,334
In fact, one guy said from the public sector side,

69
00:03:59,334 --> 00:04:03,334
it's probably just as valuable as it ever was.

70
00:04:03,334 --> 00:04:05,999
From the private sector side, it's probably just as useless

71
00:04:05,999 --> 00:04:07,959
as it ever was.

72
00:04:08,334 --> 00:04:10,083
Very interesting.

73
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:11,375
So that's a great point.

74
00:04:11,375 --> 00:04:13,876
And after being in D.C.

75
00:04:13,876 --> 00:04:16,876
for the past four years, the last couple of years

76
00:04:16,876 --> 00:04:23,083
with a ringside seat in the government, I have a little theory now.

77
00:04:23,083 --> 00:04:25,876
And one of the great struggles that I had

78
00:04:25,876 --> 00:04:30,542
in being a government I'm a terrible government employee.

79
00:04:30,542 --> 00:04:33,083
I just I wasn't good at it.

80
00:04:33,501 --> 00:04:37,250
There's too many restrictions, there's too much you just can't there's

81
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:40,292
too many boundaries about what you can say and do

82
00:04:40,292 --> 00:04:42,999
and how you say and do it.

83
00:04:43,667 --> 00:04:46,584
So my theory is this: Washington, D.C.

84
00:04:46,584 --> 00:04:51,292
occupies 61 square 61 square mile geographical footprint.

85
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:55,999
The entire continental U.S, including Hawaii and Alaska

86
00:04:55,999 --> 00:04:59,542
is 3.51 million square miles.

87
00:04:59,542 --> 00:05:02,125
So percentage wise, D.C.

88
00:05:02,125 --> 00:05:05,209
is geographically negligible.

89
00:05:05,209 --> 00:05:06,667
Here's my theory.

90
00:05:06,667 --> 00:05:09,999
There's so much power in Washington, D.C.

91
00:05:09,999 --> 00:05:12,250
that many people think they actually know more about you

92
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:14,999
and your business than you do.

93
00:05:14,999 --> 00:05:16,209
A lot of people in government talk

94
00:05:16,209 --> 00:05:18,667
about the private sector like it's some kind

95
00:05:18,667 --> 00:05:21,167
of third cousin from Moldova.

96
00:05:21,459 --> 00:05:24,334
Actually, I stole that line from somebody the other day.

97
00:05:24,334 --> 00:05:27,999
But it's true, people in Washington, D.C.

98
00:05:27,999 --> 00:05:29,999
talk about the private sector even though most

99
00:05:29,999 --> 00:05:33,083
of them have not worked for the private sector, and

100
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:36,209
they don't really understand the struggles that you

101
00:05:36,209 --> 00:05:40,999
as cyber officials face every day where you actually have to meet a payroll

102
00:05:40,999 --> 00:05:46,125
and you have different responsibilities than we do in the government.

103
00:05:47,626 --> 00:05:51,292
It's a bit of a cliche, but we hear it said a lot that 85%

104
00:05:51,292 --> 00:05:55,626
of the critical infrastructure in the nation is owned and operated

105
00:05:55,626 --> 00:05:57,999
by the private sector.

106
00:05:57,999 --> 00:06:01,292
And I don't know if that's true or not, but I think for discussion purposes,

107
00:06:01,292 --> 00:06:03,375
probably close enough.

108
00:06:03,834 --> 00:06:07,125
But it's simply not logical to think the government can know

109
00:06:07,125 --> 00:06:10,834
more than know more about 85% of the private sector than those

110
00:06:10,834 --> 00:06:13,709
of you who are in the room today.

111
00:06:14,083 --> 00:06:16,083
Those of you who are working in these organizations essential

112
00:06:16,083 --> 00:06:17,542
every day.

113
00:06:17,999 --> 00:06:23,250
So as I said, no government bashing, I'm not going to I'm not going to do that.

114
00:06:23,459 --> 00:06:25,959
But I do want to give you the bottom line up front

115
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:28,417
for you acronym word buffs.

116
00:06:28,501 --> 00:06:33,667
Bottom line up front, and for those of you that this pops your bubble,

117
00:06:33,667 --> 00:06:35,501
I apologize.

118
00:06:35,501 --> 00:06:37,334
And you can probably get up and leave and it won't hurt my

119
00:06:37,334 --> 00:06:39,125
feelings after that.

120
00:06:39,834 --> 00:06:45,083
The government is not going to come in on a big white horse and save you.

121
00:06:45,999 --> 00:06:47,999
It's not going to happen.

122
00:06:47,999 --> 00:06:50,125
The government doesn't have the resources.

123
00:06:50,584 --> 00:06:52,876
There's just no cavalry.

124
00:06:52,876 --> 00:06:56,209
By the way, as I look through the looked through the agenda,

125
00:06:56,209 --> 00:07:00,083
Nick and Josh are going to talk on Sunday morning titled

126
00:07:00,083 --> 00:07:02,626
the exact same thing.

127
00:07:02,626 --> 00:07:04,375
The cavalry isn't coming.

128
00:07:04,751 --> 00:07:06,083
I suspect they're going to talk about some

129
00:07:06,083 --> 00:07:08,999
of the same things I'm talking about today.

130
00:07:09,918 --> 00:07:13,999
The government is simply unable, at least today, to provide timely

131
00:07:13,999 --> 00:07:16,999
and actionable information when you really need it

132
00:07:16,999 --> 00:07:20,334
because the legal policy and operational restrictions

133
00:07:20,334 --> 00:07:25,626
within government are not designed to share with the private sector.

134
00:07:25,751 --> 00:07:30,083
I know that we've had this discussion, public private partnership for years

135
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:35,709
and years, but it's not working like we hoped it would way back then.

136
00:07:35,959 --> 00:07:39,209
After working there for the last couple of years, I realize

137
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:41,999
as much as we want it to, it's probably not going

138
00:07:41,999 --> 00:07:44,999
to work well enough in the private sector to depend

139
00:07:44,999 --> 00:07:50,125
on it consistently at least in the area of security intelligence sharing.

140
00:07:51,125 --> 00:07:53,999
The pace of innovation in the commercial sector

141
00:07:53,999 --> 00:07:56,584
is far more rapid than in the government,

142
00:07:56,584 --> 00:07:59,501
and primarily because Darwin's theory does apply

143
00:07:59,501 --> 00:08:01,918
in the private sector.

144
00:08:01,918 --> 00:08:04,999
You know, the strong and the sustainable survive and

145
00:08:04,999 --> 00:08:07,083
the weak don't.

146
00:08:07,292 --> 00:08:09,999
And the government not so much.

147
00:08:10,167 --> 00:08:13,834
In fact, there's so much growth in the private sector development

148
00:08:13,834 --> 00:08:17,999
of cyber security intelligence right now because industry realizes that it can,

149
00:08:17,999 --> 00:08:21,999
in fact, move faster in collecting and analyzing specific intelligence

150
00:08:21,999 --> 00:08:24,209
that's important to them.

151
00:08:24,626 --> 00:08:28,751
Private companies will monitor ICU channels and sites,

152
00:08:28,751 --> 00:08:31,999
like Paceman, just like the government can,

153
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:37,334
but they can't collect and disseminate information like the government,

154
00:08:37,334 --> 00:08:41,667
and they can't weed out the chaff to meet their specific

155
00:08:41,667 --> 00:08:43,999
government needs.

156
00:08:43,999 --> 00:08:48,667
The government is a huge bureaucracy, and that's probably not a big surprise

157
00:08:48,667 --> 00:08:50,584
to many of you.

158
00:08:51,417 --> 00:08:53,250
It was one of those things that when I went

159
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:55,584
into government I thought I could change it, and some

160
00:08:55,584 --> 00:08:58,083
of my friends told me I was foolish.

161
00:08:58,334 --> 00:08:59,459
They were right.

162
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:04,626
So there are a lot of reasons I think why getting any

163
00:09:04,626 --> 00:09:08,999
timely decisions are possible, and lawyers being one of the factors,

164
00:09:08,999 --> 00:09:13,751
sorry about that, I just met a lawyer a few minutes ago.

165
00:09:15,999 --> 00:09:20,626
But they needing to get approval before making important decisions

166
00:09:20,626 --> 00:09:23,334
I think trumps everything.

167
00:09:25,792 --> 00:09:29,876
They're leaving, I already bummed them out.

168
00:09:29,876 --> 00:09:31,667
It's a fact lost on bureaucratic organization,

169
00:09:31,667 --> 00:09:35,501
but in our business there simply isn't time to get everyone's approval

170
00:09:35,501 --> 00:09:37,959
before making a decision.

171
00:09:38,542 --> 00:09:42,876
This will make my some of some of my attorney friends mad at me,

172
00:09:42,876 --> 00:09:45,626
but I find government lawyers, not always,

173
00:09:45,626 --> 00:09:50,125
there are some good attorneys out there, but they are incredibly risk

174
00:09:50,125 --> 00:09:54,459
averse, and they don't understand cyber security.

175
00:09:54,459 --> 00:09:57,375
And that makes it a challenge for us in the operational trenches

176
00:09:57,375 --> 00:09:59,209
to do our jobs.

177
00:09:59,876 --> 00:10:02,125
I know that they don't understand it

178
00:10:02,125 --> 00:10:06,292
because I've seen the look on their face sometimes when I give

179
00:10:06,292 --> 00:10:11,959
them my look and I'm like, I can't believe you're making me do this.

180
00:10:12,876 --> 00:10:15,999
But anyway some of you know Shawn Henry, Shawn

181
00:10:15,999 --> 00:10:21,876
is he's out of the government now, too, he was spent a career in the FBI.

182
00:10:21,876 --> 00:10:23,999
Shawn was interviewed a few weeks ago and he said

183
00:10:23,999 --> 00:10:27,959
as a private citizen and taxpayer it's frightening.

184
00:10:27,959 --> 00:10:31,709
We sit here, more than six years later, arguably in a worst place than we were

185
00:10:31,709 --> 00:10:34,999
before, and we're still talking about voluntary guidelines

186
00:10:34,999 --> 00:10:37,626
and studying vulnerabilities.

187
00:10:37,626 --> 00:10:39,959
So I think the time has passed for that.

188
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:45,000
What is the value of cyber security and intelligence?

189
00:10:45,417 --> 00:10:47,959
I've been thinking about this for a long time.

190
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:53,626
When I was with NERC, I read about things classified

191
00:10:53,626 --> 00:10:58,834
about the electric utility industry, but the people who needed

192
00:10:58,834 --> 00:11:02,501
to know it didn't have security clearance, so

193
00:11:02,501 --> 00:11:05,999
the value was useless to them.

194
00:11:07,999 --> 00:11:11,334
And even when they did get briefed on classified information,

195
00:11:11,334 --> 00:11:15,083
it was usually information that they said they already knew about,

196
00:11:15,083 --> 00:11:18,584
so the value, the timeliness of the government information was

197
00:11:18,584 --> 00:11:20,999
always behind the curve.

198
00:11:21,334 --> 00:11:26,125
But there continues to be a mystique to classified information.

199
00:11:26,125 --> 00:11:29,792
People feel like they're not getting it, they're missing something.

200
00:11:29,792 --> 00:11:33,417
But when they do get it, I think they're usually disappointed.

201
00:11:33,501 --> 00:11:38,999
My CEO, he actually had a top secret SCI clearance.

202
00:11:39,167 --> 00:11:44,083
After the second time he got a brief, he's like, why am I doing this?

203
00:11:44,083 --> 00:11:45,667
I'm not learning anything new.

204
00:11:45,667 --> 00:11:46,292
And this is an absolute waste of time for me to go go

205
00:11:46,292 --> 00:11:48,083
through these briefs.

206
00:11:49,501 --> 00:11:53,417
I think it's not necessarily unusual for the kind of information that

207
00:11:53,417 --> 00:11:57,250
the government does provide to the private sector.

208
00:11:58,417 --> 00:12:03,417
When I saw started at VHS in November of 2011, the first thing

209
00:12:03,417 --> 00:12:07,375
the first document I read was by Carnegie Mellon,

210
00:12:07,375 --> 00:12:12,417
who documented the defense industrial based pilot.

211
00:12:12,459 --> 00:12:14,667
I think probably some of you have seen that or read it

212
00:12:14,667 --> 00:12:16,501
or heard about it.

213
00:12:16,501 --> 00:12:18,542
But anyway, the DIB pilot classified measures

214
00:12:18,542 --> 00:12:21,959
and signatures to certain defense related private sector

215
00:12:21,959 --> 00:12:25,542
companies, and there were about 20 companies that participated

216
00:12:25,542 --> 00:12:27,959
in that pilot program.

217
00:12:28,292 --> 00:12:30,959
The report wasn't flattering.

218
00:12:30,999 --> 00:12:34,667
And even though there were, I think, some rational explanations for why,

219
00:12:34,667 --> 00:12:37,667
it makes my case here today, so I'm going to use some

220
00:12:37,667 --> 00:12:40,125
of the numbers a little bit.

221
00:12:40,459 --> 00:12:45,083
Of all the incidents during the period of the DIB pilot, about five months,

222
00:12:45,083 --> 00:12:49,626
only about 4% of those signatures and counter measures were unique

223
00:12:49,626 --> 00:12:52,083
to the private sector.

224
00:12:52,459 --> 00:12:54,999
Let me say it again.

225
00:12:55,083 --> 00:12:58,626
4% included information that the private sector DIB companies did

226
00:12:58,626 --> 00:13:00,918
not already know about.

227
00:13:00,918 --> 00:13:04,083
Now, to be fair, I think the expectations weren't established

228
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:08,667
appropriately to begin with, and the program was getting better

229
00:13:08,667 --> 00:13:13,918
toward the end, but the bottom line is that the private sector found very

230
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:18,876
little value in the information that the government was providing back

231
00:13:18,876 --> 00:13:22,292
certainly not enough value for them to spend money

232
00:13:22,292 --> 00:13:25,834
to continue participating in that.

233
00:13:27,834 --> 00:13:32,083
And if you think about some of the other private sector reporting,

234
00:13:32,083 --> 00:13:35,751
some of the things some of the public things we've seen

235
00:13:35,751 --> 00:13:40,501
about over the past couple of years the tracking gross netting reporting,

236
00:13:40,501 --> 00:13:43,584
I think it was 2009, the McAfee shading report,

237
00:13:43,584 --> 00:13:47,626
the Luckycat report put out, and MSAPN report.

238
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:55,918
It was where actually the DNS Corps flood,

239
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:59,999
the government eventually got involved in it.

240
00:13:59,999 --> 00:14:02,999
Most of the initial work done on those was done

241
00:14:02,999 --> 00:14:05,999
by the private sector.

242
00:14:10,292 --> 00:14:15,125
And then the annual reports by Verizon, Semantic and McAfee,

243
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:20,999
which have a good accumulation of information those organizations have

244
00:14:20,999 --> 00:14:23,959
seen over the past year.

245
00:14:24,375 --> 00:14:27,334
Anyone remember the Conflicker Working Program?

246
00:14:28,334 --> 00:14:31,999
Some of you were probably part of the Conflicker Working Group.

247
00:14:32,918 --> 00:14:34,999
That was coordination and collaboration

248
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:38,083
by the private sector to develop something really important

249
00:14:38,083 --> 00:14:39,999
and really useful.

250
00:14:40,167 --> 00:14:44,209
And these guys and gals actually spent time and spent money

251
00:14:44,209 --> 00:14:48,999
out of their own pockets to help everybody, to help the nation;

252
00:14:48,999 --> 00:14:53,834
and despite Herculean efforts to get the government involved,

253
00:14:53,834 --> 00:14:56,918
they did that on their own.

254
00:14:56,918 --> 00:14:58,876
That was a private sector initiative.

255
00:14:59,584 --> 00:15:04,751
If you haven't read Mark Bowden's book, it's called "Worm," titled "Worm,"

256
00:15:04,751 --> 00:15:07,334
it walks through the entire Conflicker

257
00:15:07,334 --> 00:15:09,459
Cabal incidents.

258
00:15:09,999 --> 00:15:12,751
This was in the private sector.

259
00:15:14,334 --> 00:15:18,083
You can agree or disagree with some of these reports.

260
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:21,999
I don't agree with everything that's in some of these reports that were put

261
00:15:21,999 --> 00:15:24,417
out over the last couple of years, but the bottom line

262
00:15:24,417 --> 00:15:26,999
is they were developed without the government involvement;

263
00:15:26,999 --> 00:15:29,876
they were developed in the private sector.

264
00:15:30,999 --> 00:15:34,667
I think one interesting thing that came out of that was they had

265
00:15:34,667 --> 00:15:37,751
the unintentional consequence of forcing the government

266
00:15:37,751 --> 00:15:41,459
to actually acknowledge some of the nation's state actors that were

267
00:15:41,459 --> 00:15:44,250
involved in some of these events.

268
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:46,083
That was one of the things when I was

269
00:15:46,083 --> 00:15:50,667
the Deputy Undersecretary at DHS, as I traveled around the country

270
00:15:50,667 --> 00:15:55,459
and met with different companies, the almost continuous theme I got was

271
00:15:55,459 --> 00:15:58,083
why isn't the government doing something

272
00:15:58,083 --> 00:15:59,999
about this?

273
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:02,999
And not really part of this discussion today,

274
00:16:02,999 --> 00:16:06,751
but I can tell you one of the biggest discussions we had

275
00:16:06,751 --> 00:16:09,542
on a continuing basis at the highest levels

276
00:16:09,542 --> 00:16:14,167
of the federal government is what is the role of the federal government

277
00:16:14,167 --> 00:16:17,751
in some of these events and some of these activities,

278
00:16:17,751 --> 00:16:21,709
especially where nation states were involved.

279
00:16:21,999 --> 00:16:25,334
So I think it's a legitimate question to ask, does the U.S.

280
00:16:25,334 --> 00:16:26,999
Government have a greater U.S.

281
00:16:26,999 --> 00:16:29,999
intelligence gathering capacity than the private sector?

282
00:16:29,999 --> 00:16:31,083
And I think it depends.

283
00:16:31,125 --> 00:16:34,626
It depends on the value of the cyber security information,

284
00:16:34,626 --> 00:16:37,999
because it seems to be an increasingly small subset

285
00:16:37,999 --> 00:16:41,250
of information potentially available to identify

286
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:44,209
the source and understand a tact methodology

287
00:16:44,209 --> 00:16:47,250
and adversaries' capabilities.

288
00:16:47,459 --> 00:16:50,250
This brings us to what I think is probably one

289
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:53,918
of the most important problems with government information

290
00:16:53,918 --> 00:16:56,709
and that's overclassification.

291
00:16:57,083 --> 00:17:02,167
Anyone in here that has has had access to classified information I think has

292
00:17:02,167 --> 00:17:07,083
thought this from time to time, that the information you're seeing

293
00:17:07,083 --> 00:17:12,751
is the same has a classified sticker on it, is the same information you saw

294
00:17:12,751 --> 00:17:14,999
on CNN yesterday.

295
00:17:15,999 --> 00:17:20,501
And this is really a big problem for us for a whole lot of reasons.

296
00:17:20,626 --> 00:17:24,501
But primarily, you know, information is classified primarily

297
00:17:24,501 --> 00:17:27,751
for two reasons: One, to protect the source where

298
00:17:27,751 --> 00:17:31,417
the information came from; two, to protect the method how

299
00:17:31,417 --> 00:17:35,083
the government obtained that information.

300
00:17:35,083 --> 00:17:39,334
Most security officials, I certainly know when I was a CSO,

301
00:17:39,334 --> 00:17:42,083
I didn't care about that.

302
00:17:42,083 --> 00:17:43,709
All I cared about was the information of value

303
00:17:43,709 --> 00:17:47,918
to me and could help me protect my systems and my networks.

304
00:17:48,709 --> 00:17:53,999
So I think the government has to get better about taking that kind

305
00:17:53,999 --> 00:17:59,999
of truly classified information and and declassifying sanitizing it so it's

306
00:17:59,999 --> 00:18:03,334
of value to the private sector.

307
00:18:04,626 --> 00:18:07,999
I'm not saying there isn't any value in any classified information,

308
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:10,167
because there is, obviously, and government

309
00:18:10,167 --> 00:18:12,959
is rightly responsible for that.

310
00:18:12,959 --> 00:18:15,417
It's just that once the information does become classified

311
00:18:15,417 --> 00:18:17,999
it becomes harder to share, and the vast majority

312
00:18:17,999 --> 00:18:22,792
of threat intelligence we need can be found in the open source anyway.

313
00:18:23,751 --> 00:18:26,999
I have a CSO friend who isn't a U.S.

314
00:18:26,999 --> 00:18:30,083
citizen, and his CEO is not a U.S.

315
00:18:30,083 --> 00:18:31,667
citizen, but he happens to be the CSO

316
00:18:31,667 --> 00:18:36,999
at a very large critical infrastructure company here in the U.S.

317
00:18:36,999 --> 00:18:39,083
with a pretty big footprint and actually responsible

318
00:18:39,083 --> 00:18:42,083
for pretty large chunk of something very important

319
00:18:42,083 --> 00:18:43,999
to the nation.

320
00:18:44,918 --> 00:18:46,918
But he can't get any classified information,

321
00:18:46,918 --> 00:18:49,999
and his CEO can't get any classified information.

322
00:18:50,167 --> 00:18:53,250
You can see how that would be a really big problem.

323
00:18:54,918 --> 00:18:58,999
Most people don't know this, actually, and I didn't know it until I worked

324
00:18:58,999 --> 00:19:01,083
at NERC, but the U.S.

325
00:19:01,083 --> 00:19:03,959
gets a lot of our electricity from Canada.

326
00:19:03,999 --> 00:19:06,999
In fact, you know, the lights in here are probably being powered

327
00:19:06,999 --> 00:19:09,542
by electricity generated in Canada five minutes five

328
00:19:09,542 --> 00:19:11,083
seconds ago.

329
00:19:12,501 --> 00:19:15,584
You can see there's a problem there as well.

330
00:19:15,999 --> 00:19:18,209
While we work with the Canadian utilities on a lot

331
00:19:18,209 --> 00:19:21,999
of things, we don't work with them on sharing cyber security threat

332
00:19:21,999 --> 00:19:25,626
information because they're they don't have U.S.

333
00:19:25,626 --> 00:19:29,501
Government security clearances so we can't share that kind of information.

334
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:30,834
And that's a big problem.

335
00:19:31,459 --> 00:19:35,417
Worked with another story, when I was at NERC, I worked

336
00:19:35,417 --> 00:19:37,876
with a CSO, and we had discovered

337
00:19:37,876 --> 00:19:41,667
a pretty big vulnerability in his company, the source

338
00:19:41,667 --> 00:19:44,999
of it was classified information.

339
00:19:45,125 --> 00:19:49,584
When he when he briefed his CEO and his CFO on it, needed funding,

340
00:19:49,584 --> 00:19:54,959
out of cycle funding to fix the problem, he couldn't tell him the source

341
00:19:54,959 --> 00:19:57,083
of the why he needed the money

342
00:19:57,083 --> 00:20:00,999
because it was classified information.

343
00:20:00,999 --> 00:20:03,542
So it's pretty tough to go to your CFO with your hand

344
00:20:03,542 --> 00:20:07,459
out and hoping that your good looks and smile are going to get him

345
00:20:07,459 --> 00:20:09,751
to write you a check.

346
00:20:12,834 --> 00:20:15,459
Some of you probably are aware of the executive order that was signed

347
00:20:15,459 --> 00:20:18,000
by the president in February of this year.

348
00:20:18,167 --> 00:20:21,751
It has three a number of things, but has three primary components

349
00:20:21,751 --> 00:20:24,334
related to information sharing.

350
00:20:24,334 --> 00:20:27,709
One is a provision for expedited security clearances;

351
00:20:27,709 --> 00:20:31,751
two is a increase in the volume, timeliness and quality

352
00:20:31,751 --> 00:20:36,751
of the cyber threat information that DHS and the government provides

353
00:20:36,751 --> 00:20:39,876
to the private sector; and the third thing

354
00:20:39,876 --> 00:20:44,209
is private sector access to the DHS classified enhanced cyber

355
00:20:44,209 --> 00:20:46,542
security program.

356
00:20:46,876 --> 00:20:49,167
The enhanced the ECS program is a avenue that

357
00:20:49,167 --> 00:20:52,000
the government shares classified information

358
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,125
with certain critical infrastructure companies.

359
00:20:56,417 --> 00:21:00,626
So these are noble goals, I think, as laid out in the executive order,

360
00:21:00,626 --> 00:21:03,083
but I don't think there's any way to scale

361
00:21:03,083 --> 00:21:06,250
by providing any more security funds.

362
00:21:06,334 --> 00:21:08,792
You can't there simply is not enough manpower

363
00:21:08,792 --> 00:21:11,083
and enough money to provide security clearances

364
00:21:11,083 --> 00:21:14,999
to all the people in the nation and all the critical infrastructures that

365
00:21:14,999 --> 00:21:16,501
need them.

366
00:21:17,918 --> 00:21:22,125
I don't think you can even get close to it, so I this is something that was

367
00:21:22,125 --> 00:21:25,125
in the executive order that I think is a noble goal

368
00:21:25,125 --> 00:21:28,999
but probably not going to be not very realistic.

369
00:21:29,999 --> 00:21:32,999
And to bring up the Snowden thing again,

370
00:21:32,999 --> 00:21:36,999
you know in the post Snowden world, getting clearances

371
00:21:36,999 --> 00:21:42,626
to nongovernment employees is going to be a lot more difficult.

372
00:21:44,334 --> 00:21:46,834
The second one, increasing the amount

373
00:21:46,834 --> 00:21:50,626
of information provided back to the private sector, I think

374
00:21:50,626 --> 00:21:54,876
will have limited impact getting the handfuls of companies again,

375
00:21:54,876 --> 00:21:57,834
the scale of this is critical getting handfuls

376
00:21:57,834 --> 00:22:00,584
of the companies the classified information

377
00:22:00,584 --> 00:22:03,834
is not going to solve the problem.

378
00:22:04,083 --> 00:22:06,167
That's some of the bad news.

379
00:22:06,542 --> 00:22:10,999
I always like to wrap things up, talk about some positive things.

380
00:22:11,083 --> 00:22:14,876
And there are some positive things going on.

381
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:18,999
Sometimes you look at something and it looks bad and the end result

382
00:22:18,999 --> 00:22:21,083
of it is not so bad.

383
00:22:22,083 --> 00:22:27,167
For the past year most of you know the banking and finance industry have

384
00:22:27,167 --> 00:22:31,167
been going through these events, and they have been very,

385
00:22:31,167 --> 00:22:35,375
very challenging for many of the banks and many of the ISBs

386
00:22:35,375 --> 00:22:38,999
and they have spent a ton of money combating these

387
00:22:38,999 --> 00:22:41,626
and preparing for these.

388
00:22:41,792 --> 00:22:46,999
But a couple good things happened out of it.

389
00:22:47,334 --> 00:22:51,167
The first was I actually saw CSOs from these large banks

390
00:22:51,167 --> 00:22:56,209
and large companies sitting together in a room talking about how

391
00:22:56,209 --> 00:22:59,083
to address this problem.

392
00:22:59,083 --> 00:23:01,083
And I can tell you, two years ago you couldn't have got

393
00:23:01,083 --> 00:23:02,834
all these people in the room talking

394
00:23:02,834 --> 00:23:04,959
about issues like this.

395
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:10,542
I had a talk with one CISO at a very large bank, and she said, yeah,

396
00:23:10,542 --> 00:23:14,626
this is an absolute nightmare for us, but it was good

397
00:23:14,626 --> 00:23:19,167
because it does have we have we have really opened the lines

398
00:23:19,167 --> 00:23:22,542
of communications across this entire sector

399
00:23:22,542 --> 00:23:26,542
in ways that never would have happened.

400
00:23:26,542 --> 00:23:29,459
And so there's a lot of information sharing happening now

401
00:23:29,459 --> 00:23:33,626
on things other than the D DOS related events.

402
00:23:33,959 --> 00:23:36,292
That's really, I think, helped the banking and finance industry

403
00:23:36,292 --> 00:23:37,999
an awful lot.

404
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:43,083
So we need more of that kind of collaboration.

405
00:23:43,083 --> 00:23:45,083
There's an old military saying that cohesion

406
00:23:45,083 --> 00:23:48,209
is a combat multiplier, and we need more cohesion

407
00:23:48,209 --> 00:23:50,751
across the board and across all sectors

408
00:23:50,751 --> 00:23:53,167
to build a relationships both within and

409
00:23:53,167 --> 00:23:56,709
across industries so when cyber threats do surprise us,

410
00:23:56,709 --> 00:24:00,667
we can pull together the right kinds of teams more quickly than

411
00:24:00,667 --> 00:24:02,999
the well meaning but far too complex

412
00:24:02,999 --> 00:24:05,083
federal government.

413
00:24:05,083 --> 00:24:08,667
Sometimes it actually does take a crisis to get us to work together.

414
00:24:08,876 --> 00:24:10,999
I'm sure a few of you work are involved

415
00:24:10,999 --> 00:24:13,999
with the development of some of the information exchange

416
00:24:13,999 --> 00:24:18,709
frameworks, I want to talk about three of them very, very briefly.

417
00:24:18,792 --> 00:24:21,999
The TAXII program, Trusted Automated Exchange

418
00:24:21,999 --> 00:24:26,792
of Indicator Information, being run out of Mitre, but it's really

419
00:24:26,792 --> 00:24:32,417
an open source operation, a lot of people are involved with this.

420
00:24:32,417 --> 00:24:34,250
And TAXII is an open source collaborative

421
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:37,999
community development initiative working to define protocols

422
00:24:37,999 --> 00:24:43,459
and messages that allow the sharing of actual cyber threat information.

423
00:24:43,918 --> 00:24:45,999
What TAXII does is give organizations improved

424
00:24:45,999 --> 00:24:49,459
situational awareness about emerging threats and then allows

425
00:24:49,459 --> 00:24:53,083
them to share whatever information they choose with the partners

426
00:24:53,083 --> 00:24:55,375
they choose to do so.

427
00:24:55,999 --> 00:24:59,584
You also have the main DIN 3 open framework,

428
00:24:59,584 --> 00:25:04,999
Incident Object Description Exchange Format, or IODEF.

429
00:25:06,584 --> 00:25:11,999
It allows you to chart and categorize intrusion based

430
00:25:11,999 --> 00:25:18,501
on indicators that can be used to track down attackers.

431
00:25:18,501 --> 00:25:22,626
And the ITF program defines data representation that provides

432
00:25:22,626 --> 00:25:27,459
a framework for sharing information about threats.

433
00:25:27,999 --> 00:25:31,999
I suspect that there are quite a few involved in the development

434
00:25:31,999 --> 00:25:35,792
of those development frameworks, and I think it's, you know,

435
00:25:35,792 --> 00:25:39,501
an indication of Darwin's theory again, one of them will end

436
00:25:39,501 --> 00:25:44,999
up being a standard at some point and the other the others will go away.

437
00:25:46,083 --> 00:25:47,876
There's also the information sharing

438
00:25:47,876 --> 00:25:49,999
and analysis centers, and I know there's some

439
00:25:49,999 --> 00:25:52,334
of you involve with the ISACs.

440
00:25:52,834 --> 00:25:55,834
ISACs were established by President Clinton back in 1986.

441
00:25:58,999 --> 00:26:03,250
They established these ISAC, there was no funding that went

442
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:07,751
along with that, and so they kind of struggled over the years

443
00:26:07,751 --> 00:26:11,459
to mature and gain relevancy, but there are a couple

444
00:26:11,459 --> 00:26:15,999
of the different sectors where the ISACs I think are being very

445
00:26:15,999 --> 00:26:18,751
valuable, and they provide that forum

446
00:26:18,751 --> 00:26:21,959
for the change of information.

447
00:26:21,959 --> 00:26:25,417
Certainly financial services, the information technology, ISAC,

448
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:29,999
the defense industrial based ISAC, electricity, telecommunications,

449
00:26:29,999 --> 00:26:33,709
I think those are more of the secure ISAC.

450
00:26:33,999 --> 00:26:41,083
Some of the critical infrastructure ISAC, they're pretty immature.

451
00:26:41,584 --> 00:26:45,959
That's not a criticism, it's the fact they haven't had a lot

452
00:26:45,959 --> 00:26:49,999
of resources devoted to them over the years.

453
00:26:51,876 --> 00:26:54,999
Next thing I want to talk about is the "invitation only"

454
00:26:54,999 --> 00:26:57,709
or "you're not invited" clubs.

455
00:26:57,959 --> 00:27:01,125
And I put that in the abstract, and I've talked, you know, some

456
00:27:01,125 --> 00:27:05,751
of you have probably participated in these over the years.

457
00:27:05,999 --> 00:27:08,834
And they typically spring up in response

458
00:27:08,834 --> 00:27:12,209
to a specific threat like Conflicker.

459
00:27:12,709 --> 00:27:15,999
But they're really effective in tackling problems.

460
00:27:15,999 --> 00:27:19,334
And they're harder to get involved in, and I've actually tried to ask

461
00:27:19,334 --> 00:27:23,999
to be involved in a couple of them, and they typically say no, you're not

462
00:27:23,999 --> 00:27:27,083
the right kind of guy that we need.

463
00:27:27,083 --> 00:27:32,083
They actually want technical people that can help solve problems.

464
00:27:32,083 --> 00:27:34,167
So I bring this up because you may not have been

465
00:27:34,167 --> 00:27:38,083
invited to one of these, but if you have the right kind of skills,

466
00:27:38,083 --> 00:27:40,999
and people who know you are involved with these,

467
00:27:40,999 --> 00:27:44,959
you'll eventually get asked to participate in them.

468
00:27:45,292 --> 00:27:47,083
And actually, probably not telling you anything you

469
00:27:47,083 --> 00:27:50,083
don't know, they're pretty tough to get into.

470
00:27:50,083 --> 00:27:52,083
You usually have to have two or three people to vouch for you

471
00:27:52,083 --> 00:27:54,999
to get invited to one of these groups.

472
00:27:55,250 --> 00:28:01,999
DT and Antwan and I were talking about it a couple days ago.

473
00:28:02,792 --> 00:28:07,250
The BCBU issue is ripe that you're the kind

474
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:11,999
of group that cannot get together.

475
00:28:12,250 --> 00:28:18,626
Start putting some pressure on the vendors to solve this issue.

476
00:28:18,626 --> 00:28:21,999
This is not a hard problem, but we can't do it.

477
00:28:22,501 --> 00:28:25,999
The manufacturers, the router manufacturers really need

478
00:28:25,999 --> 00:28:29,334
to pick up the ball and work on this.

479
00:28:29,334 --> 00:28:32,250
And it seems to me it's a really good opportunity

480
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:36,999
for somebody to say, okay, let's start a our own group and work

481
00:28:36,999 --> 00:28:39,542
on solving this thing.

482
00:28:41,250 --> 00:28:42,999
So there's also a couple of things that I think

483
00:28:42,999 --> 00:28:44,959
the government can do.

484
00:28:45,542 --> 00:28:48,999
You know, they're going to continue to develop classified information,

485
00:28:48,999 --> 00:28:50,999
and that's their job.

486
00:28:50,999 --> 00:28:53,209
You know, the Department of Defense has the role

487
00:28:53,209 --> 00:28:56,626
of looking outside the continental United States,

488
00:28:56,626 --> 00:29:01,542
looking outside of our borders at threats against the U.S.

489
00:29:01,542 --> 00:29:03,999
And that's you know, that's their natural role and they're very,

490
00:29:03,999 --> 00:29:06,083
very good at doing that.

491
00:29:06,209 --> 00:29:09,999
But I think there's things that they can do that we

492
00:29:09,999 --> 00:29:15,501
as private companies can can benefit from a bit more.

493
00:29:15,501 --> 00:29:18,125
And one of those things is research and development.

494
00:29:18,125 --> 00:29:19,501
You know, the government has been

495
00:29:19,501 --> 00:29:25,209
over the years been really, really good at doing good research.

496
00:29:25,209 --> 00:29:28,375
And that has kind of changed a little bit over the past few years

497
00:29:28,375 --> 00:29:30,501
with some of the budget issues going

498
00:29:30,501 --> 00:29:33,083
on in the federal government.

499
00:29:33,292 --> 00:29:37,999
One of the first things that tends to go away, first thing that tends

500
00:29:37,999 --> 00:29:40,626
to go away is training.

501
00:29:40,626 --> 00:29:43,459
The second thing that tends to go away is R and D money.

502
00:29:44,125 --> 00:29:46,709
But the government does fund and develops

503
00:29:46,709 --> 00:29:50,250
an incredible I think advanced technology in some of our labs

504
00:29:50,250 --> 00:29:53,417
and some of our other facilities around the country,

505
00:29:53,417 --> 00:29:56,876
but I think we need more money for that.

506
00:29:56,876 --> 00:29:58,083
And we need more money for the kind

507
00:29:58,083 --> 00:30:02,250
of creative and competitive startup companies, 90% of whom are going

508
00:30:02,250 --> 00:30:05,876
to fail at some point, but you know what?

509
00:30:05,876 --> 00:30:08,167
The 10% that do make it, there's value and there's richness

510
00:30:08,167 --> 00:30:12,709
in that that the government and the nation can benefit from.

511
00:30:12,999 --> 00:30:18,083
One of the other things associated with R and D is technology transfer.

512
00:30:18,999 --> 00:30:21,751
Probably be astonishing to most people in here

513
00:30:21,751 --> 00:30:25,000
to know how much great technology is sitting on the shelf

514
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:29,167
because the government hasn't figured out how to take that technology

515
00:30:29,167 --> 00:30:32,501
and transfer it to the private sector.

516
00:30:32,999 --> 00:30:36,417
It's actually heart breaking when you think about the some of the billions

517
00:30:36,417 --> 00:30:39,125
of dollars that have been spent on some of this, and

518
00:30:39,125 --> 00:30:41,501
they haven't figured out how to get it back

519
00:30:41,501 --> 00:30:43,999
out into the public domain.

520
00:30:45,334 --> 00:30:48,417
I think that they could sponsor more training.

521
00:30:48,417 --> 00:30:52,751
This is one of the biggest issues I think facing the nation, certainly

522
00:30:52,751 --> 00:30:56,999
in the security arena right now, is the lack of talented

523
00:30:56,999 --> 00:30:59,292
and trained people.

524
00:30:59,918 --> 00:31:02,083
Part of my job at DHS was traveling

525
00:31:02,083 --> 00:31:05,792
around the country and talking with not only companies

526
00:31:05,792 --> 00:31:09,999
but talking with higher education and even high school, and one

527
00:31:09,999 --> 00:31:13,209
of the the almost constant constant mantras I heard

528
00:31:13,209 --> 00:31:17,083
from the private sector was they don't have enough people,

529
00:31:17,083 --> 00:31:20,834
they don't have enough qualified people.

530
00:31:20,834 --> 00:31:21,584
And I could ask everybody in this room

531
00:31:21,584 --> 00:31:23,125
to raise your hand right now if you have

532
00:31:23,125 --> 00:31:25,334
all of the qualified people you need in your company,

533
00:31:25,334 --> 00:31:29,083
and there wouldn't be very many hands in there, I can tell you that.

534
00:31:29,083 --> 00:31:31,834
I don't know if anyone had the chance to walk the floor,

535
00:31:31,834 --> 00:31:35,083
the vendor floor at Black Hat the past couple of days,

536
00:31:35,083 --> 00:31:39,250
but something I had never seen before, there were help wanted signs

537
00:31:39,250 --> 00:31:42,292
in many of the booths over there.

538
00:31:43,959 --> 00:31:45,876
This is a big deal.

539
00:31:45,876 --> 00:31:49,959
We do not have enough qualified people either in the government or

540
00:31:49,959 --> 00:31:52,584
in the private sector.

541
00:31:52,584 --> 00:31:55,375
And the government is starting to feel the pain a lot more

542
00:31:55,375 --> 00:31:58,501
because because of the budget issues, you know, and

543
00:31:58,501 --> 00:32:01,542
the sequestration issues, and the furlough issues,

544
00:32:01,542 --> 00:32:05,959
and I think government employees are waking up on days now saying why am

545
00:32:05,959 --> 00:32:07,999
I doing this again?

546
00:32:08,876 --> 00:32:09,999
Thanks.

547
00:32:09,999 --> 00:32:13,542
Why am I why am I busting my ass every day working 14 hours

548
00:32:13,542 --> 00:32:17,999
and you're going to furlough me and dock me 20% of my pay,

549
00:32:17,999 --> 00:32:22,375
when I can go and work in the private sector?

550
00:32:22,626 --> 00:32:27,542
It's I'm sure it's not lost on this crowd, but if you have any skills

551
00:32:27,542 --> 00:32:32,250
at all in this business, you can get a job anywhere.

552
00:32:32,375 --> 00:32:34,999
So I really do think that this is something

553
00:32:34,999 --> 00:32:37,959
the government could take a leadership role

554
00:32:37,959 --> 00:32:40,959
in and provide more training.

555
00:32:41,459 --> 00:32:48,083
And certainly not just in cyber security, in the intelligence analysis roles.

556
00:32:48,250 --> 00:32:51,918
It's a huge, huge gap and we really do need

557
00:32:51,918 --> 00:32:54,083
to address that.

558
00:32:54,083 --> 00:32:57,125
So I do one of the other things I think is funding of the ISACs.

559
00:32:57,125 --> 00:32:59,792
I think the government should take that.

560
00:32:59,792 --> 00:33:02,542
We have 16 defined critical infrastructures now.

561
00:33:02,542 --> 00:33:04,834
The government needs to fund the ISAC.

562
00:33:05,083 --> 00:33:08,083
It's the source of the information sharing among these

563
00:33:08,083 --> 00:33:12,792
critical infrastructure sectors and right now they're very haphazardly

564
00:33:12,792 --> 00:33:16,999
operated and very haphazardly funded and the government could take

565
00:33:16,999 --> 00:33:18,999
a role in that.

566
00:33:19,999 --> 00:33:22,999
To wrap up I would like to state the obvious.

567
00:33:22,999 --> 00:33:26,292
The government is going to have the resources to look outward

568
00:33:26,292 --> 00:33:31,584
to the threats, but you can't depend on getting the information to save you.

569
00:33:32,334 --> 00:33:36,083
The security threat information is up to us.

570
00:33:36,083 --> 00:33:39,999
Some forward leaning organizations, many of you here today, I'm sure,

571
00:33:39,999 --> 00:33:42,999
have already begun, and there are dozens of startups

572
00:33:42,999 --> 00:33:46,999
up there that focus on cyber security threat analysis.

573
00:33:47,334 --> 00:33:50,542
I probably talk at least to one company a week now where

574
00:33:50,542 --> 00:33:54,834
they are doing cyber security intelligence development and trying

575
00:33:54,834 --> 00:33:58,334
to find an avenue to get that back both into the public

576
00:33:58,334 --> 00:34:00,959
and the private sector.

577
00:34:02,083 --> 00:34:05,999
So remember my bottom line up front, the government is not going

578
00:34:05,999 --> 00:34:10,999
to be sliding in a cloud of smoke to save you when you have an event.

579
00:34:10,999 --> 00:34:12,999
You have to depend on yourself.

580
00:34:12,999 --> 00:34:15,292
The government just simply does not have the resources, is not going

581
00:34:15,292 --> 00:34:17,999
to have the resources to do that.

582
00:34:17,999 --> 00:34:20,667
So conversations are occurring about these issues and others,

583
00:34:20,667 --> 00:34:22,584
but unless the government figures it

584
00:34:22,584 --> 00:34:26,125
out pretty soon, I'm afraid that a lot of companies, including many

585
00:34:26,125 --> 00:34:30,584
of those that are already participating in classified cyber security intelligence

586
00:34:30,584 --> 00:34:33,417
sharing program will simply decide not to participate

587
00:34:33,417 --> 00:34:35,999
at all because it's too hard.

588
00:34:36,417 --> 00:34:37,584
And that'd be a shame.

589
00:34:38,083 --> 00:34:39,999
Thank you very much.

590
00:34:39,999 --> 00:34:40,999
(Applause).
