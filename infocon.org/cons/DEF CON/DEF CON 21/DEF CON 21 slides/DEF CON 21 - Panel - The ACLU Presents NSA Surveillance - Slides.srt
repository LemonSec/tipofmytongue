1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,250
Thank you all so much for coming to spend 45 minutes with the ACLU.

2
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:08,542
We appreciate it a lot.

3
00:00:08,876 --> 00:00:12,083
This year there are not Q&A rooms.

4
00:00:12,083 --> 00:00:13,918
So, we hope that those of you that want to continue

5
00:00:13,918 --> 00:00:17,999
the conversation will come to our table in the vendor room.

6
00:00:17,999 --> 00:00:21,125
Where you can become members or renew your membership,

7
00:00:21,125 --> 00:00:27,042
get our new DEFcon special edition ACLU 4th Amendment T-shirts.

8
00:00:27,083 --> 00:00:30,375
We would love to see you there.

9
00:00:30,999 --> 00:00:32,334
My name is Ben Wisner.

10
00:00:32,334 --> 00:00:36,083
I direct our national project on speech privacy and technology.

11
00:00:36,334 --> 00:00:39,834
The women and men at the table with me work on surveillance,

12
00:00:39,834 --> 00:00:44,375
national security, technology, privacy, both in our national office and

13
00:00:44,375 --> 00:00:48,709
in some of our affiliate sites around the country.

14
00:00:49,125 --> 00:00:52,209
When we heard that the NSA had been disinvited

15
00:00:52,209 --> 00:00:57,417
from Defcon this year, we kind of scratche dour heads a little.

16
00:00:58,083 --> 00:01:01,292
Because since when has the NSA needed to be invited.

17
00:01:04,667 --> 00:01:07,250
We had planned to do a review that we were going

18
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:11,417
to call "Year in Surveillance" and talk to you about the breadth and scope

19
00:01:11,417 --> 00:01:15,209
of the work that we do on privacy and surveillance.

20
00:01:15,999 --> 00:01:19,667
Then, Ed Snowden got on a plane to Hong Kong

21
00:01:19,667 --> 00:01:23,083
and really changed everything.

22
00:01:23,501 --> 00:01:36,083
So, maybe we should give him a hand.

23
00:01:36,083 --> 00:01:37,918
(Applause) What he revealed is something that many

24
00:01:37,918 --> 00:01:42,459
of us were anxious about,, knew about, had worried about for years.

25
00:01:42,792 --> 00:01:46,999
Which is, that the NSA's strategy has been

26
00:01:46,999 --> 00:01:53,417
to collect everything and worry about the law later.

27
00:01:53,667 --> 00:01:58,083
That as technology has developed; as the cost off collection

28
00:01:58,083 --> 00:02:02,459
and storage has gone down, the NSA has begun to construct

29
00:02:02,459 --> 00:02:08,083
the most comprehensive surveillance time machine ever created.

30
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:12,292
then that hope that the law could be twisted in order

31
00:02:12,292 --> 00:02:15,999
to justify what it was already doing.

32
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:21,999
I feel it's a cliche that the law has not kept pace

33
00:02:21,999 --> 00:02:24,459
with technology.

34
00:02:24,584 --> 00:02:28,542
We believe that Americans' privacy should be protected

35
00:02:28,542 --> 00:02:32,667
by constitutional law, not by Moore's law.

36
00:02:35,417 --> 00:02:36,834
(Applause).

37
00:02:39,584 --> 00:02:42,999
So my colleagues here are going to talk briefly.

38
00:02:42,999 --> 00:02:44,918
There's five of them, we only have 45 minutes

39
00:02:44,918 --> 00:02:47,999
and we do hope to have time for a couple questions

40
00:02:47,999 --> 00:02:52,542
to give you a taste of the kind of work that we are doing with regard

41
00:02:52,542 --> 00:02:58,375
to NSA surveillance and we hope that many of you will join us at our table.

42
00:02:58,375 --> 00:03:00,834
We also have one of the parties tonight

43
00:03:00,834 --> 00:03:06,209
on the public crawl, Party Like It's 1986, that is ACLU humor, so we hope

44
00:03:06,209 --> 00:03:09,125
to see you all more later.

45
00:03:09,459 --> 00:03:10,959
And to kick us off, this is Alex Abdo

46
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:13,709
from our national security project.

47
00:03:13,709 --> 00:03:18,459
ALEX ABDO: Hi, everyone, and thanks so much for coming.

48
00:03:18,459 --> 00:03:20,250
So I want to talk just for a few minutes

49
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:23,999
about the prison program which was revealed a couple months ago

50
00:03:23,999 --> 00:03:27,375
by Ed Snowden, but before I get to the PRISM program I want

51
00:03:27,375 --> 00:03:30,459
to talk about what there was before the PRISM program

52
00:03:30,459 --> 00:03:33,083
and what we were doing beforehand because it's

53
00:03:33,083 --> 00:03:37,751
a really fascinating change of events in the last two months.

54
00:03:37,999 --> 00:03:41,626
In 2008 Congress passed the most sweeping surveillance statute

55
00:03:41,626 --> 00:03:46,999
that Congress has ever passed, called FISA Amendments Act of 2008.

56
00:03:46,999 --> 00:03:50,334
And it begins the NSA and the government's unfettered access

57
00:03:50,334 --> 00:03:54,125
to America's international communications.

58
00:03:54,167 --> 00:03:57,167
We challenged the law at the time because we didn't think that

59
00:03:57,167 --> 00:04:00,083
the fact that someone is communicating internationally means

60
00:04:00,083 --> 00:04:03,167
they should sacrifice the right to privacy.

61
00:04:03,626 --> 00:04:06,542
That in today's interconnected world you can't often control

62
00:04:06,542 --> 00:04:10,292
the way your packets are scurried around the world, and your right

63
00:04:10,292 --> 00:04:13,459
to privacy shouldn't depend on the paths they take and

64
00:04:13,459 --> 00:04:16,834
the frames you choose to associate with.

65
00:04:16,834 --> 00:04:20,999
We brought that challenge in 2008, and for the next five years we didn't

66
00:04:20,999 --> 00:04:23,999
litigate the merits of whether the government could

67
00:04:23,999 --> 00:04:27,334
collect our international communications.

68
00:04:27,334 --> 00:04:29,417
We spent five years debating with the government

69
00:04:29,417 --> 00:04:32,626
whether our clients were allowed to sue.

70
00:04:32,834 --> 00:04:36,999
And our clients were lawyers who represented Guantanamo detainees

71
00:04:36,999 --> 00:04:42,250
and people who worked in areas of the world where there was significant

72
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:47,417
violence and terrorism interests on the part of the U.S.

73
00:04:47,417 --> 00:04:50,083
Government and journalists who reported on those areas,

74
00:04:50,083 --> 00:04:53,501
the very source of people who would find themselves

75
00:04:53,501 --> 00:04:57,125
trapped in the international NSA dragnet.

76
00:04:57,375 --> 00:05:00,292
And for that reason, these individuals we claimed

77
00:05:00,292 --> 00:05:05,292
as our clients took significant measures to protect the confidentiality

78
00:05:05,292 --> 00:05:07,999
of their communications.

79
00:05:07,999 --> 00:05:09,667
Some of those ethical obligations to do so,

80
00:05:09,667 --> 00:05:13,876
others just thought it was good professional responsibility.

81
00:05:13,999 --> 00:05:16,459
Despite that fact, the government argued that we couldn't

82
00:05:16,459 --> 00:05:21,459
sue unless our clients could prove that their communications were surveilled.

83
00:05:21,792 --> 00:05:23,083
And if you know anything about the NSA,

84
00:05:23,083 --> 00:05:25,834
you know that's a vicious Catch 22.

85
00:05:26,501 --> 00:05:29,459
Nonetheless, the government prevailed in front

86
00:05:29,459 --> 00:05:33,417
of the Supreme Court in February in a decision, 5 4 decision,

87
00:05:33,417 --> 00:05:36,167
holding that the government's most sweeping

88
00:05:36,167 --> 00:05:39,876
surveillance statute ever enacted is essentially immune

89
00:05:39,876 --> 00:05:43,999
from judicial review unless the NSA, in its benevolence, chooses

90
00:05:43,999 --> 00:05:46,999
to show who they're surveilling.

91
00:05:47,459 --> 00:05:49,501
I don't recommend you hold your breath.

92
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:56,083
That all changed two months ago when Ed Snowden revealed the existence

93
00:05:56,083 --> 00:05:58,792
of the prison program.

94
00:05:58,792 --> 00:06:04,876
And the prison program is one verse of the implementation of the FISA Act.

95
00:06:05,125 --> 00:06:08,918
It's one way the government conducts international

96
00:06:08,918 --> 00:06:13,751
surveillance, but he was governed by the statute in state, and some

97
00:06:13,751 --> 00:06:17,999
of the most important disclosures, what the government uses

98
00:06:17,999 --> 00:06:22,125
to select its targets and to protect the privacy in theory

99
00:06:22,125 --> 00:06:28,375
of Americans who find themselves ensnared in the international dragnet.

100
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:30,334
And having seen those procedures now, we know that

101
00:06:30,334 --> 00:06:32,667
they never should have been secret in the first instance,

102
00:06:32,667 --> 00:06:34,999
but they reveal a number of really critically important things

103
00:06:34,999 --> 00:06:36,542
about the way the government conducts

104
00:06:36,542 --> 00:06:38,125
its surveillance.

105
00:06:38,375 --> 00:06:40,999
The government's main defense, as you can read in the news

106
00:06:40,999 --> 00:06:43,751
about the prison program, is that it's a program directed

107
00:06:43,751 --> 00:06:45,999
at foreigners, not Americans.

108
00:06:45,999 --> 00:06:47,876
And I think that's an extraordinarily misleading

109
00:06:47,876 --> 00:06:49,709
defensive program.

110
00:06:49,999 --> 00:06:53,542
When the government was pushing for the passage of this Act, actually

111
00:06:53,542 --> 00:06:56,751
to a predecessor of the statute, it learned that some

112
00:06:56,751 --> 00:06:59,999
of the communications of most interest to the NSA were

113
00:06:59,999 --> 00:07:03,999
the ones that had one terminus in the United States.

114
00:07:03,999 --> 00:07:06,375
And you could imagine for obvious reasons why that would be

115
00:07:06,375 --> 00:07:09,584
the case, but the government used the fact that Americans were

116
00:07:09,584 --> 00:07:11,709
communicating internationally essentially

117
00:07:11,709 --> 00:07:14,876
to bootstrap away their rights to privacy.

118
00:07:14,999 --> 00:07:18,667
So even though foreigners have to be the target,

119
00:07:18,667 --> 00:07:23,375
Americans' intelligence is swept into that.

120
00:07:24,542 --> 00:07:26,792
Because the government calls the collection

121
00:07:26,792 --> 00:07:29,751
of Americans' communications insignificant, you might think

122
00:07:29,751 --> 00:07:33,125
they would treat them incidental and delete them.

123
00:07:36,626 --> 00:07:39,999
America is allowed to keep communications

124
00:07:39,999 --> 00:07:45,250
for five years in any event and indefinitely if any of a number

125
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:48,792
of sweeping exceptions apply.

126
00:07:48,999 --> 00:07:52,542
One of the exceptions, by the way, is if the information is encrypted.

127
00:07:53,834 --> 00:07:56,501
So ironically, as we are now seeing a push

128
00:07:56,501 --> 00:08:00,083
in the industry for a greater use of HTTPS and encrypted

129
00:08:00,083 --> 00:08:04,125
communications, we are actually handing the NSA more authority

130
00:08:04,125 --> 00:08:08,125
to retain those communications indefinitely until a time that

131
00:08:08,125 --> 00:08:11,999
they can decrypt them if they can't already.

132
00:08:12,375 --> 00:08:14,375
The second big problem with the government's targeting

133
00:08:14,375 --> 00:08:16,751
of foreigners is that it presumes its targets are

134
00:08:16,751 --> 00:08:19,375
foreign unless it has a reason to believe otherwise, which

135
00:08:19,375 --> 00:08:23,250
is a really bizarre way of going about it, if you can imagine.

136
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:25,709
So if the government has any doubt as to where you are and

137
00:08:25,709 --> 00:08:29,999
they don't have any positive indication you're an American, they'll treat you

138
00:08:29,999 --> 00:08:33,999
as a foreigner and targetable, and they'll retain your communications

139
00:08:33,999 --> 00:08:37,751
even if they later discover that they were wrong.

140
00:08:38,334 --> 00:08:40,918
So they think you're a foreigner, it turns out you're not,

141
00:08:40,918 --> 00:08:43,584
but they keep your communications anyway.

142
00:08:43,584 --> 00:08:46,459
And you can imagine the types of services available digitally now that

143
00:08:46,459 --> 00:08:48,709
would give the government the doubt they need

144
00:08:48,709 --> 00:08:52,999
about your foreignness that allow them to keep their communications.

145
00:08:52,999 --> 00:08:56,209
You can think of TOR and MTM communications.

146
00:08:59,999 --> 00:09:03,167
The government's defense of the prison program says

147
00:09:03,167 --> 00:09:07,667
the program is supposedly limited to foreign intelligence information

148
00:09:07,667 --> 00:09:12,709
which is this phrase they bandy about which has little meaning.

149
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:14,999
It includes things as broad as the foreign affairs

150
00:09:14,999 --> 00:09:17,959
of the United States, which essentially makes a target

151
00:09:17,959 --> 00:09:20,751
out of everyone who is a foreigner.

152
00:09:20,876 --> 00:09:23,876
And we know that in part because the procedures that were

153
00:09:23,876 --> 00:09:27,834
released by Ed Snowden confirmed that two of the broadest factors

154
00:09:27,834 --> 00:09:31,083
the government relies on in determining whether someone

155
00:09:31,083 --> 00:09:34,584
is exchanging foreign intelligence information, are one,

156
00:09:34,584 --> 00:09:37,667
if you're communicating with a foreigner; and two,

157
00:09:37,667 --> 00:09:43,292
if your phone number or e mail address appears in a foreigner's contact book.

158
00:09:43,751 --> 00:09:46,250
And the end result of these two rules and

159
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:48,918
the presumption that you are a foreigner

160
00:09:48,918 --> 00:09:52,999
is that virtually every international communication is susceptible

161
00:09:52,999 --> 00:09:55,209
to NSA surveillance.

162
00:09:55,209 --> 00:09:56,167
And they can keep those communications

163
00:09:56,167 --> 00:09:59,459
even if they later discover that you're an American.

164
00:10:00,667 --> 00:10:03,834
Just two quick additional points and then I'll hand it over.

165
00:10:03,999 --> 00:10:06,417
First, the government is not actually limited

166
00:10:06,417 --> 00:10:09,999
to directing its surveillance at targets.

167
00:10:09,999 --> 00:10:11,959
It can direct its surveillance at third parties

168
00:10:11,959 --> 00:10:14,999
to collect information about its targets.

169
00:10:14,999 --> 00:10:19,375
And it can do so using ID filtering and country code filtering.

170
00:10:19,584 --> 00:10:22,209
And the example I think that's been thrown out is that

171
00:10:22,209 --> 00:10:26,125
they might decide that Osama Bin Laden is a target and then decide

172
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:29,834
to ID filter Internet traffic going into and out of Pakistan

173
00:10:29,834 --> 00:10:32,999
as their filter and collect everything.

174
00:10:33,042 --> 00:10:35,792
So the prison program allows the government

175
00:10:35,792 --> 00:10:40,999
to do broad geographic surveillance in a way that ensures countless rights

176
00:10:40,999 --> 00:10:44,083
to privacy are intruded upon.

177
00:10:44,501 --> 00:10:48,375
And secondly, the government considers that any

178
00:10:48,375 --> 00:10:53,167
extensive use of a IP range or cryptographic service

179
00:10:53,167 --> 00:11:00,709
by foreigners allows the NSA to start that IP range or cryptographic.

180
00:11:01,999 --> 00:11:04,626
If there's something used extensively by foreigners,

181
00:11:04,626 --> 00:11:06,999
who knows what that means.

182
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:11,083
In terms of terrorists, there's not so many terrorists, we hope,

183
00:11:11,083 --> 00:11:13,999
if they are using TOR.

184
00:11:14,292 --> 00:11:17,834
The government might collect everything going over TOR

185
00:11:17,834 --> 00:11:21,876
to allow traffic analysis and later encryption.

186
00:11:22,999 --> 00:11:27,167
The irony is that those who seek to protect the sensitivity

187
00:11:27,167 --> 00:11:30,375
of their communications the most are engaging

188
00:11:30,375 --> 00:11:34,417
in communications that are born targetable whether or not

189
00:11:34,417 --> 00:11:38,250
the government has any specific reason to collect those

190
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:41,250
individuals' communications.

191
00:11:41,417 --> 00:11:43,375
I think there's an easy fix to this problem,

192
00:11:43,375 --> 00:11:47,083
but maybe we can discuss that later, and I'll hand it over for now

193
00:11:47,083 --> 00:11:48,999
with that teaser.

194
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:57,083
CATHERINE CRUMP: I'm Kathleen Crump.

195
00:11:58,999 --> 00:12:01,999
I've been at the ACLU about eight years and I've been

196
00:12:01,999 --> 00:12:05,667
primarily litigating challenges to government surveillance programs

197
00:12:05,667 --> 00:12:08,250
and that length of time has given me perspective

198
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:09,792
on this.

199
00:12:09,999 --> 00:12:14,083
The government has been saying if American people knew actually what

200
00:12:14,083 --> 00:12:17,626
was going on with some of the NSA related spying programs

201
00:12:17,626 --> 00:12:20,834
they would be outraged, but there was no way to have

202
00:12:20,834 --> 00:12:23,626
an honest conversation about what was happening

203
00:12:23,626 --> 00:12:28,334
until just recently when Edward Snowden showed these programs.

204
00:12:28,918 --> 00:12:32,709
There's information about the programs that it can be often

205
00:12:32,709 --> 00:12:36,083
difficult to figure out what the specific programs are

206
00:12:36,083 --> 00:12:38,709
and what they're doing.

207
00:12:38,709 --> 00:12:40,751
So Alex talked about the prison program,

208
00:12:40,751 --> 00:12:43,918
and now I want to spend a few minutes talking

209
00:12:43,918 --> 00:12:48,626
about the NSA's domestic collection of all metadata, why the we need

210
00:12:48,626 --> 00:12:51,250
to rein in surveillance.

211
00:12:56,751 --> 00:13:03,999
We know now by reporting by Edward Snowden, that the U.S.

212
00:13:03,999 --> 00:13:07,375
is collecting all telephony metadata.

213
00:13:08,542 --> 00:13:12,626
It's going to the secret court in Washington, D.C.

214
00:13:12,626 --> 00:13:17,083
and it seems every three months it gets an order authorizing it

215
00:13:17,083 --> 00:13:21,918
to collect telephony data from all major U.S.

216
00:13:21,999 --> 00:13:23,626
data companies.

217
00:13:23,876 --> 00:13:27,999
Every day every telephone call you make, every telephone call you receive

218
00:13:27,999 --> 00:13:33,375
and how long those telephone calls last get handed over to the government.

219
00:13:33,792 --> 00:13:36,083
This is true for domestic communications, this

220
00:13:36,083 --> 00:13:38,292
is not about international communications,

221
00:13:38,292 --> 00:13:41,918
and I think sometimes in some of the government's counter messaging

222
00:13:41,918 --> 00:13:44,083
that fact is being lost.

223
00:13:44,459 --> 00:13:47,542
The government has also tried to argue that metadata isn't sensitive

224
00:13:47,542 --> 00:13:50,999
and that made the point, for example, we're just getting telephone numbers,

225
00:13:50,999 --> 00:13:53,417
we're not getting anyone's name, but I think the people

226
00:13:53,417 --> 00:13:55,834
in this room certainly see the flaw in that argument

227
00:13:55,834 --> 00:13:58,459
without anyone having to point it out.

228
00:13:58,751 --> 00:14:01,542
It's not just the government is getting this information,

229
00:14:01,542 --> 00:14:05,334
it's that they're also storing the metadata going back five years,

230
00:14:05,334 --> 00:14:08,334
so that's really a truly vast amount of information

231
00:14:08,334 --> 00:14:12,334
about all of the communications all of us engage in.

232
00:14:12,459 --> 00:14:15,209
So what is the government doing with this information?

233
00:14:15,334 --> 00:14:17,999
Whenever the government says whenever it has

234
00:14:17,999 --> 00:14:22,250
a reasonable articulable suspicion, there's a telephone number,

235
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:26,959
for example, associated with terrorism, it can query this database

236
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:30,125
to that number and track communication that hops

237
00:14:30,125 --> 00:14:33,083
out three, the telephone number that calls

238
00:14:33,083 --> 00:14:37,876
the telephone number that calls the telephone number.

239
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:41,250
It's sweeping data.

240
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:44,876
If a person has, for example, 40 telephone numbers in that phone,

241
00:14:44,876 --> 00:14:49,250
that can sweep in as many as 2.5 million phone numbers.

242
00:14:49,542 --> 00:14:54,667
This, by the way, is being approved on an individual basis by a court.

243
00:14:54,667 --> 00:14:57,999
The FISA court has approved that general problematic approach,

244
00:14:57,999 --> 00:15:01,125
but there's no supervision of individual pieces

245
00:15:01,125 --> 00:15:04,125
of surveillance along the way.

246
00:15:04,667 --> 00:15:06,542
I want to step back for a second and talk about what

247
00:15:06,542 --> 00:15:08,999
a major paradigm shift this is.

248
00:15:09,834 --> 00:15:13,959
As Alex said, this is about collecting it all.

249
00:15:13,959 --> 00:15:16,083
We haven't lived in a world where everything we say

250
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:20,501
or do is capable of being recorded, but now that's the world we live in,

251
00:15:20,501 --> 00:15:25,125
and that's exactly what's happening when it comes to metadata.

252
00:15:25,209 --> 00:15:28,083
The government's argument is that it essentially doesn't implicate

253
00:15:28,083 --> 00:15:32,375
a privacy interest for the government to merely collect the data.

254
00:15:32,375 --> 00:15:34,334
That only happens when you look at it.

255
00:15:34,334 --> 00:15:36,999
But I think having a record of essentially everyone you call can

256
00:15:36,999 --> 00:15:39,751
have a real chilling effect on who people are willing

257
00:15:39,751 --> 00:15:41,792
to communicate with.

258
00:15:42,334 --> 00:15:45,459
The standard under which the government says what

259
00:15:45,459 --> 00:15:48,999
is the government's legal argument here?

260
00:15:48,999 --> 00:15:50,999
The government is relying on a section called 215

261
00:15:50,999 --> 00:15:53,667
of the Patriot Act which says it is authorized

262
00:15:53,667 --> 00:15:57,918
to collect information that is relevant to certain types of investigations,

263
00:15:57,918 --> 00:16:02,083
generally foreign intelligence or terrorism investigations.

264
00:16:02,083 --> 00:16:05,083
And on that relevance definition, the government has argued that every

265
00:16:05,083 --> 00:16:07,250
single phone call all Americans make are

266
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:09,999
under that definition relevant.

267
00:16:10,083 --> 00:16:13,959
Now, that's a pretty broad and sweeping definition of relevance,

268
00:16:13,959 --> 00:16:17,501
one we haven't really seen before, and I think it poses

269
00:16:17,501 --> 00:16:21,999
an interesting conundrum too in the area of big data.

270
00:16:22,417 --> 00:16:25,584
Does the fact if it is true to understand the one piece

271
00:16:25,584 --> 00:16:28,459
of data you need to understand the entire universe,

272
00:16:28,459 --> 00:16:31,834
does that make a piece of data relevant?

273
00:16:32,834 --> 00:16:34,999
The UCLA doesn't object to the problem,

274
00:16:34,999 --> 00:16:37,751
I think it raises real problems.

275
00:16:37,751 --> 00:16:40,584
One of the first orders disclosed about the court giving

276
00:16:40,584 --> 00:16:43,375
the government access to this information dealt

277
00:16:43,375 --> 00:16:47,751
with Verizon Business Network Services, which is pretty startling to us,

278
00:16:47,751 --> 00:16:50,250
because do you know who provides the ACLU's

279
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:52,876
telephone communications?

280
00:16:53,083 --> 00:16:55,125
Verizon Business Network Services.

281
00:16:55,167 --> 00:16:56,417
And we sat in our office and talked

282
00:16:56,417 --> 00:16:59,459
about all the people who called us, right?

283
00:16:59,459 --> 00:17:03,667
All the whistle blowers who call us, seeking legal help or protection.

284
00:17:03,667 --> 00:17:06,417
Everyone who calls our offices for help for reproductive services

285
00:17:06,417 --> 00:17:10,083
or reporting any number of abuses, and you can see some real problems

286
00:17:10,083 --> 00:17:12,292
with the idea that all of this information

287
00:17:12,292 --> 00:17:14,999
is being monitored and logged by the government and

288
00:17:14,999 --> 00:17:18,667
because we think that poses a real theft to the long standing right

289
00:17:18,667 --> 00:17:21,542
of Americans to be able to associate with one another,

290
00:17:21,542 --> 00:17:24,083
and also our Fourth Amendment freedom to be free

291
00:17:24,083 --> 00:17:27,167
from unreasonable searches and seizures.

292
00:17:27,167 --> 00:17:30,667
We filed a suit in the court, and we asked the court to enjoin

293
00:17:30,667 --> 00:17:34,709
the government from engaging in this mass collection program

294
00:17:34,709 --> 00:17:38,375
and also to delete all of the data from the ACLU in this

295
00:17:38,375 --> 00:17:41,667
because we know that it's sitting in a database,

296
00:17:41,667 --> 00:17:46,083
every phone call we've made for the last five years.

297
00:17:46,334 --> 00:17:48,083
The court has scheduled a briefing schedule

298
00:17:48,083 --> 00:17:50,751
for the going through the fall.

299
00:17:50,751 --> 00:17:53,125
There's an argument in November, and so hopefully by the time we're

300
00:17:53,125 --> 00:17:57,375
all back here next year we'll be able to report a little more.

301
00:18:00,792 --> 00:18:02,083
(Applause).

302
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:07,999
I don't know if any of you had the privilege

303
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:12,250
to hear Chris Soghoian this morning in the Penn and Teller room.

304
00:18:12,999 --> 00:18:14,334
(Applause).

305
00:18:15,083 --> 00:18:18,417
I made the mistake of getting there 5 to 12, and you

306
00:18:18,417 --> 00:18:20,999
all had the seats already.

307
00:18:20,999 --> 00:18:22,417
So next up, Chris Soghoian.

308
00:18:22,417 --> 00:18:24,542
CHRISTOPHER SOGHOIAN: Hi, everyone.

309
00:18:24,542 --> 00:18:26,751
I'm the principal technologist with our technology project

310
00:18:26,751 --> 00:18:28,667
and technology team.

311
00:18:28,667 --> 00:18:29,999
I joined last fall.

312
00:18:29,999 --> 00:18:32,250
For those of you who caught my talk earlier,

313
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:36,250
the FBI is now in the hacking business.

314
00:18:36,334 --> 00:18:38,709
If you didn't catch the talk, hopefully the video will be available

315
00:18:38,709 --> 00:18:40,209
at some point.

316
00:18:41,209 --> 00:18:44,834
I want to talk for the few minutes I have, I want to talk about how

317
00:18:44,834 --> 00:18:46,918
the government spies.

318
00:18:48,584 --> 00:18:53,334
There are not enough FBI agents to follow every person.

319
00:18:53,375 --> 00:18:57,417
There are not enough NSA employees to read everyone's e mail or to go

320
00:18:57,417 --> 00:19:01,542
and directly acquire everyone's communications.

321
00:19:01,626 --> 00:19:03,709
The government doesn't have the resources

322
00:19:03,709 --> 00:19:08,667
to directly monitor every American or let alone every foreigner.

323
00:19:09,083 --> 00:19:10,667
But they want to read the communications

324
00:19:10,667 --> 00:19:13,999
of every foreigner and they wants to be able to collect information

325
00:19:13,999 --> 00:19:16,083
about every American.

326
00:19:16,083 --> 00:19:19,125
And so they have this problem, particularly for dragnet style searches,

327
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:21,999
where you want to do a key word search or you want

328
00:19:21,999 --> 00:19:26,959
to do social network analysis, you need everyone's communications.

329
00:19:26,959 --> 00:19:29,292
What do you do when you don't have the manpower

330
00:19:29,292 --> 00:19:32,959
to collect everyone's communications?

331
00:19:33,083 --> 00:19:36,375
You deputized telephone and Internet companies,

332
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:39,834
in some cases with their willing assistance, and

333
00:19:39,834 --> 00:19:44,209
in other cases against their will, but you force these companies

334
00:19:44,209 --> 00:19:46,083
to help out.

335
00:19:46,292 --> 00:19:50,999
Sometimes paying helps to get them to agree.

336
00:19:51,876 --> 00:19:54,542
One of the documents Edward Snowden

337
00:19:54,542 --> 00:19:57,999
released was a 2009 Inspector General Report

338
00:19:57,999 --> 00:20:03,167
of the NSA showing payments were made to telecommunication companies

339
00:20:03,167 --> 00:20:09,626
to get them to participate in some of the domestic metadata programs.

340
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:11,918
$100 million goes a long way when you're buying

341
00:20:11,918 --> 00:20:13,999
the goodwill of companies who are going

342
00:20:13,999 --> 00:20:18,292
out of their way to help the government with its mission.

343
00:20:18,292 --> 00:20:22,000
So I want to talk about the role these companies play.

344
00:20:22,542 --> 00:20:25,292
Every Internet company, every telephone company has a team

345
00:20:25,292 --> 00:20:29,999
of people who do nothing but respond to surveillance requests.

346
00:20:29,999 --> 00:20:31,459
And I'm not going to talk about how many requests

347
00:20:31,459 --> 00:20:33,209
they get because my colleague Nicky

348
00:20:33,209 --> 00:20:37,125
will be talking about that, but I want to emphasize these companies provide

349
00:20:37,125 --> 00:20:42,375
assistance that enable surveillance that wouldn't be possible without their help.

350
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:44,918
There would not be a 215 metadata program

351
00:20:44,918 --> 00:20:48,999
without the willing assistance of AT&T and Verizon

352
00:20:48,999 --> 00:20:51,709
and reportedly Sprint.

353
00:20:51,999 --> 00:20:54,000
It simply wouldn't be possible.

354
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,834
There wouldn't be a program of monitoring the communications

355
00:20:56,834 --> 00:21:00,250
of foreigners talking to Americans if the NSA couldn't get

356
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:03,083
the undersea cable operators to provide access

357
00:21:03,083 --> 00:21:08,083
to the communications that are flowing through fiber optic cables.

358
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:11,876
One with a foreigner, and one end with an American,

359
00:21:11,876 --> 00:21:16,709
or both foreigners and passing through the United States.

360
00:21:16,709 --> 00:21:18,999
The NSA program depends upon American

361
00:21:18,999 --> 00:21:22,209
communications companies.

362
00:21:22,751 --> 00:21:25,417
What's good is communications have shifted

363
00:21:25,417 --> 00:21:28,417
in the last few years from telephone companies

364
00:21:28,417 --> 00:21:30,959
to Internet companies.

365
00:21:30,959 --> 00:21:33,083
We're starting to see companies that aren't

366
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:36,334
as happy about being deputized.

367
00:21:36,334 --> 00:21:39,125
We're starting to see companies that are deploying

368
00:21:39,125 --> 00:21:43,167
crypto, whether it's HTPS, to protect data over the wire, or

369
00:21:43,167 --> 00:21:46,751
in some cases end to end crypto, and what it's doing

370
00:21:46,751 --> 00:21:49,626
is making dragnet available.

371
00:21:50,167 --> 00:21:53,999
I don't think we'll be able to put the government out of surveillance.

372
00:21:54,626 --> 00:21:57,999
I would like to personally, but I don't think we'll get there,

373
00:21:57,999 --> 00:22:02,083
but I think we could make dragnet surveillance impossible.

374
00:22:02,459 --> 00:22:05,876
We just have to raise the cost.

375
00:22:05,876 --> 00:22:08,751
We have to make it difficult enough to target one person that

376
00:22:08,751 --> 00:22:14,417
they simply don't have the resources to collect everyone's communications.

377
00:22:14,417 --> 00:22:16,751
Crypto can help us get there.

378
00:22:16,999 --> 00:22:19,999
Moving from companies that say yes to dragnet requests

379
00:22:19,999 --> 00:22:25,083
to companies that only say yes to targeted requests can help too.

380
00:22:25,083 --> 00:22:27,751
But I really think we need to be thinking not

381
00:22:27,751 --> 00:22:30,834
about making it impossible for the government

382
00:22:30,834 --> 00:22:33,375
but making it expensive.

383
00:22:33,999 --> 00:22:36,542
Chris Rock has this joke in which he says

384
00:22:36,542 --> 00:22:41,918
he believes guns should be legal and bullets a million dollars apiece.

385
00:22:42,083 --> 00:22:45,709
And I think surveillance should be expensive, too, but right now

386
00:22:45,709 --> 00:22:49,167
the cost of surveillance is too damn low.

387
00:22:49,667 --> 00:22:50,918
Thank you very much.

388
00:22:53,876 --> 00:22:55,083
(Applause).

389
00:22:58,083 --> 00:23:01,751
NICOLE OZER: Hi, everyone, I'm Nicole Ozer, I'm

390
00:23:01,751 --> 00:23:06,417
the policy director for the ACLU of California, so nice to be back

391
00:23:06,417 --> 00:23:08,542
with you today.

392
00:23:08,709 --> 00:23:11,167
I want to take a bigger picture for a moment

393
00:23:11,167 --> 00:23:15,209
to understand just how Edward Snowden's impact has rippled

394
00:23:15,209 --> 00:23:19,417
out much farther than NSA spying, much farther than the docs

395
00:23:19,417 --> 00:23:23,999
he released or the revelations, or just to give everyone a sense

396
00:23:23,999 --> 00:23:28,999
of just how important these revelations have been to getting out the truth

397
00:23:28,999 --> 00:23:33,250
about what's really happening and ongoing efforts by the ACLU

398
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:37,667
and other organizations to really reestablish some desperately

399
00:23:37,667 --> 00:23:41,999
needed and long overdue balance between government surveillance

400
00:23:41,999 --> 00:23:44,999
and all our personal privacy.

401
00:23:44,999 --> 00:23:49,667
So Edward Snowden's actions, in terms of giving us a sense

402
00:23:49,667 --> 00:23:53,834
of what the NSA has been doing, has finally given us

403
00:23:53,834 --> 00:23:57,459
all a real first information on just how often,

404
00:23:57,459 --> 00:24:01,083
as Chris was talking about, that the government

405
00:24:01,083 --> 00:24:05,999
from the lowest levels of police on the street to all the way

406
00:24:05,999 --> 00:24:11,083
up to the highest echelon of the U.S.A., how often the government

407
00:24:11,083 --> 00:24:14,542
is taking advantage of laws from the 1980s,

408
00:24:14,542 --> 00:24:20,250
outdated privacy laws that haven't been updated since the 1980s from when

409
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:23,999
the web existed, from when our cellphones were

410
00:24:23,999 --> 00:24:27,292
the size of bricks and no one would imagine

411
00:24:27,292 --> 00:24:32,501
people would store e mail for longer than six months.

412
00:24:32,792 --> 00:24:38,209
And they've been taking advantage of these outdated laws and things that

413
00:24:38,209 --> 00:24:43,083
really haven't been properly reconsidered for decades to engage

414
00:24:43,083 --> 00:24:46,375
in what we have known for a long time to be

415
00:24:46,375 --> 00:24:50,999
a largely unsupervised shopping spree in the treasure trove

416
00:24:50,999 --> 00:24:56,167
of data that online companies are collecting every day about who each

417
00:24:56,167 --> 00:25:01,999
of us are, where we go on a daily basis, who we know, what our concerns are,

418
00:25:01,999 --> 00:25:05,542
our habits, our hobbies, and are keeping that

419
00:25:05,542 --> 00:25:09,167
for extremely long periods of time.

420
00:25:09,334 --> 00:25:13,626
The ACLU first really started to sound the alarm about the sort

421
00:25:13,626 --> 00:25:19,209
of surveillance industrial complex that had been growing and growing largely

422
00:25:19,209 --> 00:25:23,375
in the dark way back a decade ago in 2003.

423
00:25:23,626 --> 00:25:26,876
We knew for a long time that this was happening, that

424
00:25:26,876 --> 00:25:31,083
the government was really reaching into these treasure troves

425
00:25:31,083 --> 00:25:34,709
and largely getting at this data without a warrant,

426
00:25:34,709 --> 00:25:39,709
without a judge's permission, but we never had the facts.

427
00:25:39,999 --> 00:25:43,876
The government doesn't need to tell the American people how often they're

428
00:25:43,876 --> 00:25:49,167
demanding electronic communications, they're being held by these companies.

429
00:25:49,167 --> 00:25:52,417
Unlike the fact they have to report how many wiretaps they issue,

430
00:25:52,417 --> 00:25:58,083
they're not required by law to do that, so they weren't doing it, no surprise.

431
00:25:58,501 --> 00:26:00,334
And the companies weren't very interested

432
00:26:00,334 --> 00:26:03,999
in telling us either how many times the government was knocking

433
00:26:03,999 --> 00:26:08,501
on their door asking for really personal data about people.

434
00:26:08,501 --> 00:26:11,083
They didn't really want to give us pause and wonder and worry,

435
00:26:11,083 --> 00:26:14,792
are we really having sort of a three way conversation every time

436
00:26:14,792 --> 00:26:17,999
we e mail a friend or pick up the phone?

437
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:21,999
So we knew it was happening, but the facts just weren't there.

438
00:26:21,999 --> 00:26:23,751
The companies largely didn't want to come forward and

439
00:26:23,751 --> 00:26:25,709
the government didn't want to didn't want

440
00:26:25,709 --> 00:26:28,626
to give us this information voluntarily.

441
00:26:28,709 --> 00:26:32,083
But post PRISM, a lot of what we had known

442
00:26:32,083 --> 00:26:35,999
for a long time was confirmed.

443
00:26:35,999 --> 00:26:39,209
The companies, in an attempt to actually defend themselves

444
00:26:39,209 --> 00:26:43,375
against being surveilled said they had been given a back door

445
00:26:43,375 --> 00:26:47,459
to the government; and to actually try and assuage the fears

446
00:26:47,459 --> 00:26:51,999
of the public, many of them for the first time released transparency

447
00:26:51,999 --> 00:26:56,125
reports that gave some contours of just how many demands were

448
00:26:56,125 --> 00:27:01,083
coming from local law enforcement all the way up the pike.

449
00:27:01,083 --> 00:27:03,209
We had some companies, like Google and Twitter,

450
00:27:03,209 --> 00:27:07,083
come forward with these reports before, but post PRISM, was

451
00:27:07,083 --> 00:27:11,999
the first time that folks like Yahoo and Apple and Facebook actually came

452
00:27:11,999 --> 00:27:15,167
out with this information as well.

453
00:27:15,209 --> 00:27:19,834
And it really confirms what we had long known, that tens of thousands

454
00:27:19,834 --> 00:27:23,999
of requests are coming into these companies, you know, just

455
00:27:23,999 --> 00:27:30,375
in a six month basis that is affecting 80, 90, 100,000 different accounts.

456
00:27:30,375 --> 00:27:32,918
And if you think about all the information that Google

457
00:27:32,918 --> 00:27:36,999
might have in a particular account, it may be tons and tons of e mails

458
00:27:36,999 --> 00:27:40,584
and photos, sort of the whole range of data.

459
00:27:40,999 --> 00:27:44,375
So we know from some of the reports, Google and Twitter are actually doing

460
00:27:44,375 --> 00:27:47,751
a break down of how many of these demands are actually coming

461
00:27:47,751 --> 00:27:50,999
with a warrant and how many of these demands are actually just

462
00:27:50,999 --> 00:27:55,083
coming with a subpoena which a judge has often never seen.

463
00:27:55,584 --> 00:27:59,375
And as we expected, subpoenas are sort of much take

464
00:27:59,375 --> 00:28:02,542
the bulk of these things.

465
00:28:02,999 --> 00:28:07,334
You know, Twitter recently reported just a couple of days ago that 56%

466
00:28:07,334 --> 00:28:11,417
of the demands for the government are subpoenas.

467
00:28:11,417 --> 00:28:15,501
Only 23% are warrants with probable cause.

468
00:28:15,501 --> 00:28:19,542
And Google has gotten over 5,000 demands that are subpoena

469
00:28:19,542 --> 00:28:23,292
demands just in the past six months that accounts

470
00:28:23,292 --> 00:28:27,459
for over 10,000 plus accounts of people.

471
00:28:27,459 --> 00:28:30,167
So we're finally starting to see a glimpse into how often

472
00:28:30,167 --> 00:28:32,999
the government is demanding this information,

473
00:28:32,999 --> 00:28:36,667
which finally gives us some of the facts to talk to Congress

474
00:28:36,667 --> 00:28:40,667
about how important it truly is to update these laws and make sure

475
00:28:40,667 --> 00:28:43,959
that they do keep pace with the technology that we're

476
00:28:43,959 --> 00:28:46,999
all living in, the fact that we are living our lives

477
00:28:46,999 --> 00:28:49,792
online, and the government shouldn't be able

478
00:28:49,792 --> 00:28:52,709
to reach in and spy on that personal information

479
00:28:52,709 --> 00:28:58,083
without having a very good reason and going to a judge and explaining it.

480
00:28:58,083 --> 00:29:06,999
Thank you.

481
00:29:06,999 --> 00:29:07,999
(Applause).

482
00:29:07,999 --> 00:29:09,584
So we have one more speaker, we have 15 minutes, we probably

483
00:29:09,584 --> 00:29:12,959
will have time for a couple of questions.

484
00:29:12,959 --> 00:29:15,959
So maybe while my colleague Kade Crockford is speaking, if someone

485
00:29:15,959 --> 00:29:18,667
of you want to gather at the microphones, we'll try

486
00:29:18,667 --> 00:29:20,999
to take a bunch of questions at once and use

487
00:29:20,999 --> 00:29:24,417
the last couple minutes to answer questions.

488
00:29:24,417 --> 00:29:26,999
KADE CROCKFORD: I'm Kade Crockford, I work as the director

489
00:29:26,999 --> 00:29:29,292
of technology in Massachusetts.

490
00:29:34,959 --> 00:29:39,542
To explain what I'm going to talk about, over the past years we've seen a shift

491
00:29:39,542 --> 00:29:42,083
in the relationship between the governed and

492
00:29:42,083 --> 00:29:46,167
the government, and that is marked by two really problematic features,

493
00:29:46,167 --> 00:29:48,999
one of them is that now we're basically guilty

494
00:29:48,999 --> 00:29:52,125
until proven innocent as these bulk records collections

495
00:29:52,125 --> 00:29:55,417
programs demonstrate, and the second is that, you know,

496
00:29:55,417 --> 00:29:58,918
the way a democracy works is the government is transparent

497
00:29:58,918 --> 00:30:02,417
and people have privacy from the government.

498
00:30:02,417 --> 00:30:05,334
Unfortunately, that situation has been radically flipped, so now

499
00:30:05,334 --> 00:30:08,375
the government is incredibly secretive, as we know,

500
00:30:08,375 --> 00:30:12,125
about these surveillance policies, as well as even about the law

501
00:30:12,125 --> 00:30:14,999
in some cases, and the government, if it wants

502
00:30:14,999 --> 00:30:19,083
to know nearly everything about us, even if it doesn't have articulable

503
00:30:19,083 --> 00:30:22,209
situation, probable cause, show evidence to a judge,

504
00:30:22,209 --> 00:30:27,250
all of the sort of, you know, traditional American norms of justice.

505
00:30:27,417 --> 00:30:30,501
Having to frame the conversation in that way, I just want

506
00:30:30,501 --> 00:30:33,999
to talk very briefly about how some little brothers have

507
00:30:33,999 --> 00:30:37,000
sprung up over the past 12 years.

508
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:41,083
We've heard a lot about Big Brother and the surveillance by corporations,

509
00:30:41,083 --> 00:30:44,999
but also the Department of Homeland Security and Department

510
00:30:44,999 --> 00:30:48,584
of Justice have over the past 12 years given billions

511
00:30:48,584 --> 00:30:52,417
and billions of dollars to state and local law enforcement

512
00:30:52,417 --> 00:30:56,709
to build up a robust police militarized presence.

513
00:30:59,792 --> 00:31:03,709
They have done this by funding the procurement of things

514
00:31:03,709 --> 00:31:08,918
like electronic fingerprint readers at state and local police departments

515
00:31:08,918 --> 00:31:11,542
nationwide, face technologies, as well

516
00:31:11,542 --> 00:31:14,999
as automatic license plates readers.

517
00:31:14,999 --> 00:31:17,999
Can I get a show of hands how many people know what

518
00:31:17,999 --> 00:31:19,626
that is?

519
00:31:19,626 --> 00:31:20,876
Great, you're awesome.

520
00:31:21,083 --> 00:31:24,792
We put out a huge report on this, actually, you can see it

521
00:31:24,792 --> 00:31:26,999
at ACLU.org/plates.

522
00:31:26,999 --> 00:31:29,959
Basically, what we found is the state and local police

523
00:31:29,959 --> 00:31:33,417
departments as well as private corporations are operating

524
00:31:33,417 --> 00:31:37,334
under the same methodology as NSA, they want it all, they want

525
00:31:37,334 --> 00:31:40,292
to collect records of what everyone has driven,

526
00:31:40,292 --> 00:31:43,292
going back even months or years.

527
00:31:43,834 --> 00:31:47,125
We found regulations are all over the map.

528
00:31:47,709 --> 00:31:50,375
There are only five states that have laws on the books

529
00:31:50,375 --> 00:31:52,751
about this technology.

530
00:31:52,751 --> 00:31:54,999
Every other state it's up to the local police departments

531
00:31:54,999 --> 00:31:57,999
to decide how long they want to keep records where everyone

532
00:31:57,999 --> 00:31:59,501
has driven.

533
00:31:59,626 --> 00:32:03,501
Right now, as I'm sure you know, these cameras are not as ubiquitous

534
00:32:03,501 --> 00:32:08,501
as surveillance cameras, but they will become that ubiquitous.

535
00:32:08,501 --> 00:32:09,999
I'm sure in the next 20 years these cameras

536
00:32:09,999 --> 00:32:13,626
will be on every police cruiser in urban sections.

537
00:32:15,083 --> 00:32:18,083
It's a situation where the government will be able

538
00:32:18,083 --> 00:32:21,709
to track our driving habits retroactively for however long

539
00:32:21,709 --> 00:32:24,209
they keep this information.

540
00:32:24,709 --> 00:32:30,209
So I also just want to tell you very quickly about okay.

541
00:32:30,292 --> 00:32:32,209
On the license plate reader tip, private companies,

542
00:32:32,209 --> 00:32:34,501
there are these private companies, one of which

543
00:32:34,501 --> 00:32:36,999
is called Vigilance Solutions.

544
00:32:36,999 --> 00:32:40,792
It maintains a database of the national driver's license service.

545
00:32:41,918 --> 00:32:45,834
It has one billion discrete license plates, actually more than that,

546
00:32:45,834 --> 00:32:49,999
those are slightly dated figures I'm working off of, and that information

547
00:32:49,999 --> 00:32:53,250
is accessible not only to state and local law enforcement

548
00:32:53,250 --> 00:32:58,083
as well as FBI, immigration, customs enforcement, likely the U.S.

549
00:32:58,083 --> 00:33:02,999
military, but other private companies, insurance companies, repo men,

550
00:33:02,999 --> 00:33:05,542
tow truck drivers.

551
00:33:05,542 --> 00:33:09,083
So, you know, the corollary between the NSA's surveillance

552
00:33:09,083 --> 00:33:13,375
and collusion with Google and state and local cops colluding

553
00:33:13,375 --> 00:33:16,083
with companies like Vigilant Solutions

554
00:33:16,083 --> 00:33:20,876
is a very serious problem, like again, as my colleagues have said,

555
00:33:20,876 --> 00:33:24,999
in the vast majority of cases state legislatures have not

556
00:33:24,999 --> 00:33:28,999
really stepped up to the plate to deal with.

557
00:33:28,999 --> 00:33:30,751
And so that's some of the work that we're trying to do

558
00:33:30,751 --> 00:33:33,167
in the states, is to pass discrete legislation that

559
00:33:33,167 --> 00:33:37,999
would, for example, ban the police from retaining this data for a long time.

560
00:33:38,125 --> 00:33:40,999
You know, the ACLU, Chris maybe is the one exception to this,

561
00:33:40,999 --> 00:33:43,918
but the ACLU as an organization does not oppose law

562
00:33:43,918 --> 00:33:46,999
enforcement surveillance if they go to the judge and get

563
00:33:46,999 --> 00:33:49,709
a probable cause warrant, right?

564
00:33:49,876 --> 00:33:52,501
There are murderers in the world, there are rapists.

565
00:33:52,501 --> 00:33:54,083
People do bad things.

566
00:33:54,083 --> 00:33:55,542
If there's evidence to show somebody is involved

567
00:33:55,542 --> 00:33:58,125
in criminal activity then, you know, the judge should give

568
00:33:58,125 --> 00:34:01,501
the cops a warrant to invade that person's privacy.

569
00:34:01,501 --> 00:34:03,334
I personally don't like it either but I think it's

570
00:34:03,334 --> 00:34:05,999
a reasonable it's a reasonable balance to strike

571
00:34:05,999 --> 00:34:08,542
between privacy and security.

572
00:34:08,584 --> 00:34:11,417
But we're seeing a really what we have now

573
00:34:11,417 --> 00:34:17,959
is that that probable cause warrant practice barely exists anymore.

574
00:34:17,959 --> 00:34:19,918
The DOJ has said to Congress that it doesn't think it

575
00:34:19,918 --> 00:34:22,876
needs a warrant to read our e mails.

576
00:34:22,876 --> 00:34:26,250
The DOJ has also said to Congress and to courts that we have no privacy

577
00:34:26,250 --> 00:34:29,918
interest in information showing where we go 24 hours a day that

578
00:34:29,918 --> 00:34:32,334
is communicated through cell site information

579
00:34:32,334 --> 00:34:34,709
through our cellphones.

580
00:34:34,709 --> 00:34:36,375
And I just want to give you really quickly

581
00:34:36,375 --> 00:34:39,959
a very brief example of how not only the collect it all sort

582
00:34:39,959 --> 00:34:43,083
of theme has trickled down to the state and local level,

583
00:34:43,083 --> 00:34:46,209
but also the state's secrecy itself has really trickled

584
00:34:46,209 --> 00:34:48,999
down in a really dangerous way.

585
00:34:48,999 --> 00:34:50,792
And that is a case we had a couple years ago

586
00:34:50,792 --> 00:34:52,999
during Occupy Boston.

587
00:34:52,999 --> 00:34:56,083
Somebody decided to pick a fight with the cops and put together

588
00:34:56,083 --> 00:35:00,250
a paste bin with information about Boston police officers which was

589
00:35:00,250 --> 00:35:02,751
all publicly available.

590
00:35:02,751 --> 00:35:05,999
This person didn't do anything illegal, they put it together in a database

591
00:35:05,999 --> 00:35:08,125
and put it on Paceman.

592
00:35:08,709 --> 00:35:11,626
Suffolk County didn't like that.

593
00:35:12,999 --> 00:35:17,083
They sent an administrative subpoena to Twitter.

594
00:35:17,083 --> 00:35:19,626
This is not a warrant, it's no judge ever sees this piece

595
00:35:19,626 --> 00:35:23,083
of paper, subpoenas are just pieces of paper that prosecutors fill

596
00:35:23,083 --> 00:35:27,918
out and give to companies like Google, Microsoft, Twitter, Facebook.

597
00:35:27,918 --> 00:35:29,999
So Twitter is one of very few companies that actually

598
00:35:29,999 --> 00:35:32,209
stands up for its users on a routine basis when

599
00:35:32,209 --> 00:35:34,999
they get these subpoenas, and they do that by informing

600
00:35:34,999 --> 00:35:36,626
the person who is targeted that

601
00:35:36,626 --> 00:35:39,334
a subpoena has been filed, that prosecutors are seeking

602
00:35:39,334 --> 00:35:41,542
information about them.

603
00:35:41,542 --> 00:35:43,459
So what happened was this person came to us at the ACLU

604
00:35:43,459 --> 00:35:46,999
of Massachusetts and said, "The DA in Suffolk County wants my information

605
00:35:46,999 --> 00:35:50,751
and I'd like to remain anonymous," so we took the case.

606
00:35:50,751 --> 00:35:53,417
It was incredible what happened after that.

607
00:35:53,417 --> 00:35:55,709
You know, this is a legal issue.

608
00:35:55,834 --> 00:35:59,334
This is not something Al Qaeda, national security issue, but we had a,

609
00:35:59,334 --> 00:36:01,999
you know, pipsqueak, I'm going to say that,

610
00:36:01,999 --> 00:36:05,999
this pipsqueak Assistant DA, right, in Suffolk County telling a judge,

611
00:36:05,999 --> 00:36:09,584
you know, holding ex parte hearings, which essentially means

612
00:36:09,584 --> 00:36:12,417
the government is giving information to the judge

613
00:36:12,417 --> 00:36:16,209
in secret that not even our attorneys could see.

614
00:36:16,459 --> 00:36:18,501
So secret proceedings.

615
00:36:18,501 --> 00:36:22,334
And to this day two years later, those records are secret.

616
00:36:22,334 --> 00:36:23,334
They were sealed.

617
00:36:23,334 --> 00:36:25,999
The prosecutor asked that these records be sealed.

618
00:36:25,999 --> 00:36:27,292
So I mean, it's just incredible abuse of power going

619
00:36:27,292 --> 00:36:30,083
on at all levels of government.

620
00:36:30,459 --> 00:36:31,959
And I think that's it.

621
00:36:31,959 --> 00:36:34,667
There are people who probably have a lot of questions.

622
00:36:34,667 --> 00:36:34,959
I would just say please support the ACLU if you have a concern

623
00:36:34,959 --> 00:36:35,999
about these issues.

624
00:36:37,083 --> 00:36:39,999
We are working on a range of issues, from choice

625
00:36:39,999 --> 00:36:43,083
to privacy and everything in between.

626
00:36:43,083 --> 00:36:44,083
Thanks for coming.

627
00:36:44,083 --> 00:36:45,083
I appreciate it.

628
00:36:45,083 --> 00:36:46,083
(Applause).

629
00:36:46,083 --> 00:36:56,417
So so I see six people standing.

630
00:36:56,417 --> 00:36:57,918
We have nine minutes.

631
00:36:57,918 --> 00:36:58,999
Maybe seven.

632
00:36:58,999 --> 00:37:01,999
The only way we're going to make this work is if people speak

633
00:37:01,999 --> 00:37:05,167
for 30 seconds and ask a question.

634
00:37:05,167 --> 00:37:08,709
If you have statements for us, we'll be at the table this afternoon.

635
00:37:08,709 --> 00:37:10,792
You will not believe my ability to violate your right to free speech

636
00:37:10,792 --> 00:37:12,999
if you go 30 seconds (laughter).

637
00:37:13,999 --> 00:37:17,542
I'm really good at it.

638
00:37:17,542 --> 00:37:20,918
So we'll start here, but really, we don't want to hear your story.

639
00:37:20,918 --> 00:37:21,918
Is the mic on?

640
00:37:21,918 --> 00:37:22,584
I'm Mike Daughtry from Atlanta, I was going to ask you

641
00:37:22,584 --> 00:37:26,083
about the judicial decision, I'm under (Unintelligible).

642
00:37:33,292 --> 00:37:37,250
It is amazing, the judicial system I find incredibly

643
00:37:37,250 --> 00:37:40,542
behind and judges don't deal.

644
00:37:40,709 --> 00:37:42,999
So how do you deal with the judges who don't deal

645
00:37:42,999 --> 00:37:47,542
in a judicial system that's so far behind looking the other way?

646
00:37:47,584 --> 00:37:48,999
Let's hear the next one.

647
00:37:48,999 --> 00:37:51,999
We're going to take them all and then we're going to answer.

648
00:37:51,999 --> 00:37:54,999
My name is Dana, I'm from San Antonio, Texas.

649
00:37:55,250 --> 00:37:57,999
These issues come up, I'm concerned, so I write my Congressman

650
00:37:57,999 --> 00:38:02,584
and my representative like, you know, I'm supposed to or I'm told to do.

651
00:38:02,584 --> 00:38:03,584
Yeah.

652
00:38:03,584 --> 00:38:05,626
I make phone calls, I leave messages.

653
00:38:05,626 --> 00:38:07,125
All I get is the excuse me?

654
00:38:07,125 --> 00:38:09,876
(speaker off microphone.)    Okay.

655
00:38:09,876 --> 00:38:10,999
The question is?

656
00:38:10,999 --> 00:38:12,542
What can I do?

657
00:38:12,542 --> 00:38:13,501
How can I get a better response than thank you

658
00:38:13,501 --> 00:38:16,667
for being a concerned citizen, we'll get back to you?

659
00:38:16,709 --> 00:38:18,501
I don't ever get a response?

660
00:38:18,501 --> 00:38:22,125
Citizen empowerment.

661
00:38:22,125 --> 00:38:23,334
Next, quickly.

662
00:38:23,751 --> 00:38:25,999
So what about me?

663
00:38:25,999 --> 00:38:28,918
I'm not American, I'm a foreigner, obviously I use American services

664
00:38:28,918 --> 00:38:30,542
all the time.

665
00:38:31,459 --> 00:38:35,083
Am I suspicious just because I'm a foreigner?

666
00:38:35,083 --> 00:38:36,083
That's my question.

667
00:38:36,083 --> 00:38:37,083
Good question.

668
00:38:37,083 --> 00:38:38,083
Go ahead.

669
00:38:38,083 --> 00:38:39,999
Thank you.

670
00:38:40,083 --> 00:38:42,375
We're going to go over here.

671
00:38:42,375 --> 00:38:45,542
Any thoughts or remarks on Sandra Riden's speech

672
00:38:45,542 --> 00:38:48,792
and his delusions to his theoretical geo

673
00:38:48,792 --> 00:38:50,999
tracking program?

674
00:38:53,999 --> 00:38:56,834
Quickly, next.

675
00:38:56,834 --> 00:39:01,375
2006, 2007, I assisted most of the telecommunications companies

676
00:39:01,375 --> 00:39:05,918
in the country installing probes for law enforcement,

677
00:39:05,918 --> 00:39:08,542
also known as Kalia.

678
00:39:08,918 --> 00:39:11,375
That was all done on their dime, and I believe one

679
00:39:11,375 --> 00:39:15,334
of the speakers mentioned that they were being subsidized.

680
00:39:15,334 --> 00:39:16,709
I'm curious to know how we know that's being

681
00:39:16,709 --> 00:39:19,083
subsidized by the government.

682
00:39:19,083 --> 00:39:22,584
Come to at a us at our table, please.

683
00:39:22,584 --> 00:39:24,626
Go ahead.

684
00:39:24,626 --> 00:39:28,999
How can people get access to this stuff through for civil matters,

685
00:39:28,999 --> 00:39:30,999
civil lawsuits?

686
00:39:32,751 --> 00:39:34,250
Okay.

687
00:39:34,250 --> 00:39:35,999
And again, most of these answers are going

688
00:39:35,999 --> 00:39:38,876
to be provided at our makeshift A part of the Q

689
00:39:38,876 --> 00:39:42,999
and A at our table in the vendor area, but go ahead.

690
00:39:42,999 --> 00:39:46,999
I didn't hear anything on LexisNexis or Fusion Centers.

691
00:39:47,375 --> 00:39:49,209
Come talk to me.

692
00:39:49,292 --> 00:39:50,584
Yeah.

693
00:39:50,584 --> 00:39:51,584
Okay.

694
00:39:51,584 --> 00:39:56,083
So fellow panelists, there are a range of things you can weigh in on.

695
00:39:56,083 --> 00:39:57,334
I hope someone will at least say something

696
00:39:57,334 --> 00:40:00,125
about the feeling of helplessness that citizens have who

697
00:40:00,125 --> 00:40:02,792
write to their legislators, because it seems we're

698
00:40:02,792 --> 00:40:06,209
in a pretty unique moment where we're being heard.

699
00:40:06,999 --> 00:40:08,042
Go ahead.

700
00:40:08,042 --> 00:40:09,999
I will respond to two of the things.

701
00:40:10,876 --> 00:40:15,918
If Senator Widener has been warning about the surveillance

702
00:40:15,918 --> 00:40:21,999
for a couple years, he's been hitting the issue of location.

703
00:40:21,999 --> 00:40:25,834
He gave a speech last year in which he said the word "location" five times.

704
00:40:26,042 --> 00:40:30,042
If he could signal any more clearly, I don't know what it would look like.

705
00:40:30,042 --> 00:40:32,792
Right now he's basically standing on a stool waving his hands jumping

706
00:40:32,792 --> 00:40:34,334
up and down.

707
00:40:34,334 --> 00:40:36,167
So I think there's something locationally that he's trying

708
00:40:36,167 --> 00:40:39,999
to tell us about, and I hope we will find out what it is.

709
00:40:40,083 --> 00:40:42,876
The question about the foreigners, it's not that you're suspicious,

710
00:40:42,876 --> 00:40:44,999
it's just you're fair game.

711
00:40:45,501 --> 00:40:49,417
Foreigners don't vote in Kansas, and it doesn't protect

712
00:40:49,417 --> 00:40:53,250
the communications of non Americans.

713
00:40:53,375 --> 00:40:54,999
That's really unfortunate.

714
00:40:54,999 --> 00:40:57,709
I think if we if we were going to see change there, it's not going

715
00:40:57,709 --> 00:41:01,167
to be because individuals were writing to their members, it's going

716
00:41:01,167 --> 00:41:03,209
to be because companies are complaining

717
00:41:03,209 --> 00:41:06,999
they're losing out on contracts in Europe and Asia.

718
00:41:07,083 --> 00:41:10,417
If the Klout computing companies want to salvage their foreign business,

719
00:41:10,417 --> 00:41:13,792
we need to see a big change in the law or they're going to have

720
00:41:13,792 --> 00:41:18,709
to start using anti and Encrypto where you don't care about access to data.

721
00:41:18,709 --> 00:41:19,709
Alex?

722
00:41:20,584 --> 00:41:24,834
ALEX ABDO: Just quickly on what you can do.

723
00:41:24,834 --> 00:41:26,542
A week and a half, two weeks ago there was

724
00:41:26,542 --> 00:41:28,834
an incredibly important vote in the house

725
00:41:28,834 --> 00:41:32,584
about whether the government was going to rein in the bulk collection

726
00:41:32,584 --> 00:41:34,751
of our phone records.

727
00:41:35,501 --> 00:41:39,751
Unsurprisingly the vote lost; but surprisingly, it was close, 217

728
00:41:39,751 --> 00:41:41,584
to 205 votes.

729
00:41:41,584 --> 00:41:43,501
And a big part of the reason why the vote was so close

730
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:46,999
is because literally thousands of people called their representatives

731
00:41:46,999 --> 00:41:50,209
and urged them to vote in support of the bill that would have reined

732
00:41:50,209 --> 00:41:51,876
in the NSA.

733
00:41:51,876 --> 00:41:52,999
That support matters more than you know,

734
00:41:52,999 --> 00:41:55,999
more than I knew up until a few weeks ago.

735
00:41:55,999 --> 00:41:57,999
If you have any questions about it, you should really talk

736
00:41:57,999 --> 00:42:00,667
to Kevin Bacon who has been doing some incredible work

737
00:42:00,667 --> 00:42:02,626
on this and can speak to how effective it

738
00:42:02,626 --> 00:42:05,542
is for to you call your representatives.

739
00:42:05,667 --> 00:42:08,999
I would like to say for those of us here in California,

740
00:42:08,999 --> 00:42:12,125
we know how difficult Feinstein has been on these issues,

741
00:42:12,125 --> 00:42:15,999
she's been a huge supporter for the NSA, and it's been intractable

742
00:42:15,999 --> 00:42:18,083
for years and years.

743
00:42:18,083 --> 00:42:21,083
Couple days ago Feinstein actually said, hmmm, maybe there needs

744
00:42:21,083 --> 00:42:23,167
to be some changes.

745
00:42:23,751 --> 00:42:25,999
And we also saw President Obama meeting

746
00:42:25,999 --> 00:42:29,626
with top legislators just a couple of days ago saying he's open

747
00:42:29,626 --> 00:42:31,459
to suggestions.

748
00:42:31,459 --> 00:42:34,167
So, you know, we have finally sort of started to turn the tide

749
00:42:34,167 --> 00:42:36,375
in Washington, D.C.

750
00:42:36,375 --> 00:42:39,999
based on the facts that members of the public have picked up the phone,

751
00:42:39,999 --> 00:42:43,999
have responded to those e mails from the ACLU and have started

752
00:42:43,999 --> 00:42:48,083
to meet actually with their members of Congress.

753
00:42:48,083 --> 00:42:50,083
So it is making a huge difference.

754
00:42:50,083 --> 00:42:52,167
We've talked a lot about sort of how we got to this point and

755
00:42:52,167 --> 00:42:55,751
the problems that we're seeing, but we're at a really crucial point

756
00:42:55,751 --> 00:42:58,999
to turn the tide on these issues, and I really hope that anyone

757
00:42:58,999 --> 00:43:02,709
in the audience who has not picked up the phone and called their members

758
00:43:02,709 --> 00:43:04,999
of Congress or stopped by our booth and filled

759
00:43:04,999 --> 00:43:08,250
out the action alert, please do it, because we can change this,

760
00:43:08,250 --> 00:43:09,999
we really can.

761
00:43:09,999 --> 00:43:14,125
This is predictable and self serving note to end on, but it matters a lot

762
00:43:14,125 --> 00:43:17,834
for you to become members of the ACLU.

763
00:43:17,876 --> 00:43:20,834
And I mean it, I mean it.

764
00:43:20,834 --> 00:43:23,709
You know, we have between 6 and 700,000 ACLU

765
00:43:23,709 --> 00:43:26,292
members nationwide.

766
00:43:26,292 --> 00:43:28,709
The NRA has over 4 million members.

767
00:43:28,709 --> 00:43:32,417
If all of you who had an affinity for the ACLU were members

768
00:43:32,417 --> 00:43:35,584
of the ACLU we would have a lot more voice,

769
00:43:35,584 --> 00:43:38,999
a much louder voice in Washington.

770
00:43:38,999 --> 00:43:40,626
I'm not saying that to denigrate the NRA for those

771
00:43:40,626 --> 00:43:43,999
of you who are supporters, they're a very effective organization

772
00:43:43,999 --> 00:43:46,209
in support of what they do.

773
00:43:46,209 --> 00:43:48,959
We can be even more    Help us about that effective.

774
00:43:48,959 --> 00:43:50,999
No, no, seriously, it matters a lot to have

775
00:43:50,999 --> 00:43:53,792
a large civil society counterweight to the kinds

776
00:43:53,792 --> 00:43:57,375
of developments we've been talking about today.

777
00:43:57,375 --> 00:44:01,999
So please come by, get our special edition DEF CON 4 Alert.

778
00:44:03,459 --> 00:44:05,834
Thank you so much for joining us today.
