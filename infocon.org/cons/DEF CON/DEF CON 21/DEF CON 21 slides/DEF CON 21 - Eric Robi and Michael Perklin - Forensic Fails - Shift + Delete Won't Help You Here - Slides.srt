1
00:00:00,042 --> 00:00:02,876
ERIC ROBI: Talk is about forensic fails.

2
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:06,542
I'm this guy.

3
00:00:06,999 --> 00:00:07,999
Over here.

4
00:00:07,999 --> 00:00:11,876
I founded an eDiscovery company a few years ago.

5
00:00:11,876 --> 00:00:12,999
I'm a forensic examiner.

6
00:00:13,042 --> 00:00:16,209
I've done thousands and thousands of exams.

7
00:00:16,375 --> 00:00:21,250
I'm an expert witness in state and federal court and I like cats

8
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:24,417
and my name is Eric Robi.

9
00:00:24,417 --> 00:00:25,584
AUDIENCE: Hi, Eric!

10
00:00:25,584 --> 00:00:32,999
ERIC ROBI: Hi.

11
00:00:32,999 --> 00:00:33,999
About this other guy.

12
00:00:33,999 --> 00:00:36,292
MICHAEL PERKLIN: Hi, I'm Michael Perklin.

13
00:00:36,292 --> 00:00:37,125
You may remember from past DEF CONs

14
00:00:37,125 --> 00:00:39,501
from ACL Steganography.

15
00:00:39,999 --> 00:00:43,999
I'm a forensic examiner, cyber crime investigator,

16
00:00:43,999 --> 00:00:46,709
security professional.

17
00:00:46,999 --> 00:00:49,375
I've also done thousands of exams.

18
00:00:49,959 --> 00:00:51,999
And I like to break things.

19
00:00:52,375 --> 00:00:53,375
A lot.

20
00:00:53,375 --> 00:00:58,334
(Chuckles.)    ERIC ROBI: Don't break my cat.

21
00:00:59,334 --> 00:01:00,999
All right.

22
00:01:00,999 --> 00:01:01,999
So our agenda today.

23
00:01:01,999 --> 00:01:04,584
We've got seven amazing stories full of fail.

24
00:01:04,584 --> 00:01:07,918
We are going to learn something about forensic techniques.

25
00:01:07,918 --> 00:01:08,999
That's what we do.

26
00:01:08,999 --> 00:01:14,459
The fails are brought to you by both the suspect and the examiner.

27
00:01:14,459 --> 00:01:16,125
We'll get into that in a little bit.

28
00:01:16,125 --> 00:01:19,459
The names have been changed to protect the idiots on both sides.

29
00:01:19,459 --> 00:01:22,751
We actually changed some of the facts to protect the idiots.

30
00:01:22,999 --> 00:01:25,167
It seemed like a good thing to do, basically.

31
00:01:25,709 --> 00:01:28,334
Because fail was not just one-dimensional, we found many

32
00:01:28,334 --> 00:01:31,334
dimensions of fail in our research.

33
00:01:31,334 --> 00:01:35,334
We decided we need to create a fail matrix.

34
00:01:38,167 --> 00:01:42,167
(Laughter.)    ERIC ROBI: To explain how the fail ...

35
00:01:42,167 --> 00:01:45,459
I'm going to explain how the fail matrix works.

36
00:01:45,626 --> 00:01:49,584
The first level of fail is the user retard level.

37
00:01:50,375 --> 00:01:52,999
Oh, my God, I spelled that wrong!

38
00:01:52,999 --> 00:01:55,083
(Laughter.)    MICHAEL PERKLIN: Drink!

39
00:01:55,083 --> 00:01:56,083
Drink!

40
00:01:56,083 --> 00:02:02,292
For the record, he was responsible for the keynote presentation.

41
00:02:02,292 --> 00:02:03,999
So this is definitely his fail.

42
00:02:03,999 --> 00:02:05,292
ERIC ROBI: This is my fail.

43
00:02:05,542 --> 00:02:06,999
I get ten points.

44
00:02:06,999 --> 00:02:10,834
So the punishment level depends on what happens.

45
00:02:10,834 --> 00:02:12,667
So this particular guy lost the case.

46
00:02:12,999 --> 00:02:15,959
Dollars, distress caused, let's give this 15 points.

47
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:19,375
And bonus points are whatever the fuck I feel like doing.

48
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:22,709
His girlfriend left him in this case.

49
00:02:22,709 --> 00:02:25,209
So he gets 35 points.

50
00:02:26,999 --> 00:02:28,999
Let's get into the first one.

51
00:02:29,375 --> 00:02:32,292
This is the "it wasn't me" defense.

52
00:02:33,375 --> 00:02:35,751
You may have heard this one before.

53
00:02:35,751 --> 00:02:37,125
All right.

54
00:02:37,125 --> 00:02:39,792
So we do a lot of commercial litigation.

55
00:02:39,918 --> 00:02:43,792
And a really typical kind of case is a trade secrets case.

56
00:02:44,083 --> 00:02:45,999
This is a typical example of that.

57
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:49,584
This guy Bob, he was working in sales at ac me.

58
00:02:49,584 --> 00:02:52,959
He resigned his position and decided to go work for a competitor.

59
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:54,959
This happens all the time.

60
00:02:55,167 --> 00:02:57,918
And some allegations were made by his employer that

61
00:02:57,918 --> 00:03:00,459
he took some trade secrets.

62
00:03:00,459 --> 00:03:03,167
He took the customer list with him to his new company.

63
00:03:03,584 --> 00:03:04,584
It happens.

64
00:03:04,751 --> 00:03:07,417
So Bob says I got nothing to hide.

65
00:03:07,459 --> 00:03:08,876
Come at me, bros.

66
00:03:09,375 --> 00:03:14,709
He didn't exactly say that, but I'm paraphrasing.

67
00:03:14,709 --> 00:03:18,125
We started imaging the drive and planning the examination.

68
00:03:18,501 --> 00:03:21,292
One thing we frequently do is we look for deleted file

69
00:03:21,292 --> 00:03:23,501
and unallocated space.

70
00:03:23,876 --> 00:03:26,250
That's the part of the drive that can typically contain

71
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:28,083
a deleted file.

72
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:31,459
When you hit shift delete and it doesn't go away, it ends

73
00:03:31,459 --> 00:03:33,999
up in unallocated space.

74
00:03:33,999 --> 00:03:35,125
We look for stuff there.

75
00:03:35,626 --> 00:03:38,959
Something we do, we look for recently used files

76
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:42,626
by common programs by Word, Excel, Acrobat and so forth

77
00:03:42,626 --> 00:03:45,209
and USB device insertion.

78
00:03:45,209 --> 00:03:49,751
We look to see how trade secrets got from acme to the new company.

79
00:03:51,125 --> 00:03:55,751
The drive finished imaging and I'll share something really cool today,

80
00:03:55,751 --> 00:03:58,751
DEF CON exclusive, worldwide premiere, we found

81
00:03:58,751 --> 00:04:00,999
a new wiping pattern.

82
00:04:11,167 --> 00:04:13,999
(Laughter.) (Cheers and applause.)    ERIC ROBI: This

83
00:04:13,999 --> 00:04:15,999
is actually real.

84
00:04:17,501 --> 00:04:19,751
I'm not making this up.

85
00:04:19,751 --> 00:04:20,751
This is real.

86
00:04:23,999 --> 00:04:28,792
So Bob apparently had used some kind of data destruction program that can

87
00:04:28,792 --> 00:04:32,999
over write every bit of space, unallocated space.

88
00:04:33,209 --> 00:04:36,459
He used a pattern that, however, was not really commonly used

89
00:04:36,459 --> 00:04:40,083
by Windows or any other utilities I've seen.

90
00:04:40,083 --> 00:04:41,959
Might have been something custom.

91
00:04:41,959 --> 00:04:44,876
So you know, I thought: Hmm, this might suggest something bad was

92
00:04:44,876 --> 00:04:46,626
happening here.

93
00:04:47,834 --> 00:04:51,083
Let's maybe take another closer look at this.

94
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:52,999
(Chuckles.)    ERIC ROBI: We are going to zoom in on this and look

95
00:04:52,999 --> 00:04:55,375
at this on a molecular level now.

96
00:05:01,626 --> 00:05:04,334
(Applause.) (Laughter.)    ERIC ROBI: I think we need to zoom

97
00:05:04,334 --> 00:05:06,292
in a little bit more.

98
00:05:12,626 --> 00:05:17,209
(Laughter.)    ERIC ROBI: So what have we learned in I admit the first part,

99
00:05:17,209 --> 00:05:20,626
there was no Sarah Palin in this case.

100
00:05:20,751 --> 00:05:24,167
Data destruction can almost always be detected even

101
00:05:24,167 --> 00:05:28,999
if you don't use a repeating pattern, it's detectable.

102
00:05:28,999 --> 00:05:30,083
We see it all the time.

103
00:05:30,083 --> 00:05:32,999
Artifacts can be left behind that are part of the pattern.

104
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:36,125
We might not know what you destroyed,

105
00:05:36,125 --> 00:05:39,375
but we'll know you destroyed something.

106
00:05:40,083 --> 00:05:41,459
Oops.

107
00:05:42,083 --> 00:05:43,959
This is the mic.

108
00:05:43,959 --> 00:05:44,959
There you go.

109
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:47,501
And all of a sudden it doesn't work very well.

110
00:05:47,999 --> 00:05:50,083
Mean phrases make people dislike you.

111
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:53,751
MICHAEL PERKLIN: What about the fail matrix?

112
00:05:53,876 --> 00:05:58,209
ERIC ROBI: We have to do the fail matrix.

113
00:05:58,209 --> 00:05:59,209
Da da da.

114
00:05:59,209 --> 00:06:00,209
12.

115
00:06:00,209 --> 00:06:01,626
Pretty retarded, I think.

116
00:06:01,999 --> 00:06:03,999
The guy lost the case.

117
00:06:03,999 --> 00:06:04,999
He got sued.

118
00:06:05,375 --> 00:06:07,083
Under $100,000.

119
00:06:07,083 --> 00:06:09,542
So not a huge amount of economic distress.

120
00:06:09,834 --> 00:06:11,959
I didn't give him any bonus points here.

121
00:06:11,959 --> 00:06:13,459
It just wasn't that good.

122
00:06:14,459 --> 00:06:16,209
He gets 27.

123
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:22,999
MICHAEL PERKLIN: I think I'll do --    ERIC ROBI: It's already a fail.

124
00:06:22,999 --> 00:06:26,083
(Laughter.)    MICHAEL PERKLIN: I think we can blame that guy who gave

125
00:06:26,083 --> 00:06:27,876
me the beer.

126
00:06:30,459 --> 00:06:31,876
All right.

127
00:06:31,876 --> 00:06:35,083
So this case is a lot of fun.

128
00:06:35,167 --> 00:06:37,667
I didn't expect it to be fun when it started out.

129
00:06:37,667 --> 00:06:39,083
It ended up being a lot of fun.

130
00:06:39,083 --> 00:06:40,959
I call it the Nickel Back guy.

131
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:42,459
You'll see why in a second.

132
00:06:43,209 --> 00:06:46,459
Another case of stolen confidential documents.

133
00:06:46,459 --> 00:06:49,083
This guy, let's call him John.

134
00:06:49,083 --> 00:06:52,292
He left one company to go work for a direct competitor.

135
00:06:52,459 --> 00:06:56,292
And his old company hired us to go in and take a look

136
00:06:56,292 --> 00:07:00,999
at his --    ERIC ROBI: Can we get audio for this?

137
00:07:00,999 --> 00:07:03,083
By the way, we need audio for this segment.

138
00:07:03,083 --> 00:07:04,417
Turn it on?

139
00:07:04,918 --> 00:07:06,918
MICHAEL PERKLIN: So the company where he left,

140
00:07:06,918 --> 00:07:09,834
they asked us to take a look at his work computer to look

141
00:07:09,834 --> 00:07:12,334
for signs of data exfiltration.

142
00:07:12,792 --> 00:07:15,083
We, he worked on a lot of confidential projects and

143
00:07:15,083 --> 00:07:18,083
they wanted to make sure that he wasn't taking these confidential

144
00:07:18,083 --> 00:07:20,584
projects to the competitor and letting them know what

145
00:07:20,584 --> 00:07:22,250
they were doing.

146
00:07:22,709 --> 00:07:24,292
So, right.

147
00:07:27,751 --> 00:07:29,999
I totally said all that.

148
00:07:30,918 --> 00:07:32,417
Why is this not working?

149
00:07:32,876 --> 00:07:33,876
There it is.

150
00:07:33,959 --> 00:07:35,250
We opened up the hard drive to start

151
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:39,459
the analysis and we started finding all the same stuff that you typically find

152
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:41,459
on a work computer.

153
00:07:41,667 --> 00:07:44,876
Work stuff, sure, some evidence of Facebooking.

154
00:07:45,209 --> 00:07:47,292
He's got an MP3 collection.

155
00:07:47,459 --> 00:07:49,584
He listened to music while he was at work.

156
00:07:49,584 --> 00:07:50,626
Typical stuff.

157
00:07:50,751 --> 00:07:52,334
We found the confidential documents that we

158
00:07:52,334 --> 00:07:55,626
were asked to make sure that he didn't take.

159
00:07:55,626 --> 00:07:58,959
So that was to be expected because he did the work

160
00:07:58,959 --> 00:08:01,209
on this computer.

161
00:08:01,626 --> 00:08:04,709
And almost immediately something jumped out at me.

162
00:08:04,709 --> 00:08:08,999
And we will get into why it jumped out at me in a second,

163
00:08:08,999 --> 00:08:14,584
but his music collection became very interesting to me.

164
00:08:14,584 --> 00:08:16,999
Not because I love Nickel Back, but because -- well, again,

165
00:08:16,999 --> 00:08:18,999
we'll get into that.

166
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:20,709
ERIC ROBI: That would be fail.

167
00:08:20,709 --> 00:08:22,417
MICHAEL PERKLIN: Yeah.

168
00:08:22,417 --> 00:08:23,834
I'm Canadian, too, so I ...

169
00:08:24,792 --> 00:08:26,709
yeah, Nickel Back is from Canada.

170
00:08:26,709 --> 00:08:28,083
AUDIENCE: (Speaker away from microphone.)    MICHAEL

171
00:08:28,083 --> 00:08:30,999
PERKLIN: Yeah, take a closer look at this photo, something may jump

172
00:08:30,999 --> 00:08:32,959
out at you as well.

173
00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:39,167
These are MP3s, just songs, but the size of the files is a little bit off.

174
00:08:39,292 --> 00:08:42,709
ERIC ROBI: What's wrong here?

175
00:08:42,709 --> 00:08:45,083
MICHAEL PERKLIN: Extended play Nickel Back.

176
00:08:45,083 --> 00:08:46,709
This guy loved the Nickel Back.

177
00:08:46,751 --> 00:08:48,876
These are actually AVI files.

178
00:08:48,876 --> 00:08:51,667
AUDIENCE: (Speaker away from microphone.)    MICHAEL

179
00:08:51,667 --> 00:08:56,083
PERKLIN: These are AVI file that is he just renamed.

180
00:08:59,209 --> 00:09:03,459
John assumed nobody would listen to his Nickel Back MP3s.

181
00:09:03,459 --> 00:09:05,999
That's a good assumption because nobody would listen

182
00:09:05,999 --> 00:09:08,459
to his Nickel Back MP3s.

183
00:09:09,792 --> 00:09:12,334
He was hiding something.

184
00:09:12,334 --> 00:09:13,834
But what was he hiding?

185
00:09:13,834 --> 00:09:24,709
(Music playing.)    MICHAEL PERKLIN: Pregger porn.

186
00:09:26,792 --> 00:09:31,209
This guy was looking at pregger porn.

187
00:09:31,209 --> 00:09:36,417
These were full-length feature films of pregnant ladies banging.

188
00:09:36,417 --> 00:09:41,459
And they were like, there was a ton of them all over this guy's hard drive.

189
00:09:41,501 --> 00:09:43,417
AUDIENCE: (Speaker away from microphone.)    MICHAEL

190
00:09:43,417 --> 00:09:46,999
PERKLIN: We did have top analyze them to see what they were.

191
00:09:47,334 --> 00:09:50,584
(Laughter.)    MICHAEL PERKLIN: But I will say that

192
00:09:50,584 --> 00:09:56,709
the specific techniques that we used to analyze, they're trade secrets.

193
00:09:56,709 --> 00:10:01,000
I can't tell you how much depth we went into when we were analyzing them.

194
00:10:01,792 --> 00:10:03,792
Yeah, seems that John did a lot more than work

195
00:10:03,792 --> 00:10:06,709
on his confidential project on that computer.

196
00:10:06,918 --> 00:10:09,999
We had to tell the company that over the last three years while

197
00:10:09,999 --> 00:10:12,999
he was working there on this confidential project,

198
00:10:12,999 --> 00:10:15,751
he was also doing other stuff.

199
00:10:15,999 --> 00:10:18,083
They were pretty happy that he left anyway.

200
00:10:18,083 --> 00:10:20,459
(Laughter.)    MICHAEL PERKLIN: All right.

201
00:10:20,459 --> 00:10:21,584
What have we learned?

202
00:10:22,375 --> 00:10:25,501
Examiners, when we take a look at files on a computer,

203
00:10:25,501 --> 00:10:29,999
we don't typically look at it in the nested folder structure.

204
00:10:29,999 --> 00:10:32,626
Like we don't have to go into every single subfolder, go back,

205
00:10:32,626 --> 00:10:35,459
go to other subfolders, back it out.

206
00:10:35,459 --> 00:10:37,042
We have a big long list.

207
00:10:37,584 --> 00:10:40,542
It makes it easier to analyze stuff.

208
00:10:40,999 --> 00:10:45,083
One of the very first things we always run is Codifile Signature Analysis.

209
00:10:45,083 --> 00:10:48,334
This is a special script that looks at the contents of every final

210
00:10:48,334 --> 00:10:52,626
and compares what is inside the file with the extension.

211
00:10:52,626 --> 00:10:54,999
If there's any discrepancies, those files are bumped up to the top

212
00:10:54,999 --> 00:10:57,459
of the list to be looked at because the system knows

213
00:10:57,459 --> 00:10:59,999
if these don't match, something may not be right here

214
00:10:59,999 --> 00:11:02,876
and a human should take a look at this.

215
00:11:03,626 --> 00:11:07,959
I just said those things and so at the end of the day John's attempt

216
00:11:07,959 --> 00:11:12,125
at hiding his pregger porn bumped it up to the top of the list for me

217
00:11:12,125 --> 00:11:13,959
to look at.

218
00:11:14,417 --> 00:11:17,959
If you're going to hide something, don't just change the file name.

219
00:11:18,999 --> 00:11:21,167
That makes me want to look at it even more.

220
00:11:21,999 --> 00:11:23,999
So the fail matrix.

221
00:11:24,834 --> 00:11:28,083
(Laughter.)    MICHAEL PERKLIN: The retard level, I would say 12.

222
00:11:28,083 --> 00:11:30,751
Again renaming a file is not data hiding.

223
00:11:30,751 --> 00:11:33,542
If up want to hide data, come to my Steg ACL course.

224
00:11:38,876 --> 00:11:42,999
The new company where he landed, he lost his job there.

225
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:46,125
Distress caused was zero.

226
00:11:46,125 --> 00:11:47,667
Didn't really hurt anybody.

227
00:11:47,667 --> 00:11:50,417
What you choose to do on your own time is up to you.

228
00:11:50,417 --> 00:11:51,792
Although he chose to do it.

229
00:11:51,999 --> 00:11:55,999
ERIC ROBI: You know what the bonus points are going to be for,

230
00:11:55,999 --> 00:11:57,834
don't you?

231
00:11:57,834 --> 00:12:00,250
MICHAEL PERKLIN: There are some bonus points.

232
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:01,501
About a nickel's worth.

233
00:12:05,584 --> 00:12:10,918
(Laughter.) (Loud buzzer.)    MICHAEL PERKLIN: Grand total of 30 fail points.

234
00:12:10,918 --> 00:12:14,876
ERIC ROBI: That is the fail sound.

235
00:12:14,876 --> 00:12:15,876
Thank you.

236
00:12:15,876 --> 00:12:18,209
By the way, do you like the font that we're using?

237
00:12:18,834 --> 00:12:20,459
Comic Sans.

238
00:12:20,999 --> 00:12:23,209
Nobody uses Comic Sans.

239
00:12:23,209 --> 00:12:26,999
It's the most under appreciated font in presentations.

240
00:12:26,999 --> 00:12:28,334
MICHAEL PERKLIN: I don't know why we don't see Comic Sans

241
00:12:28,334 --> 00:12:30,584
in more presentation settings.

242
00:12:30,584 --> 00:12:33,334
ERIC ROBI: We're bringing it back.

243
00:12:35,083 --> 00:12:38,250
Let's look at the "just bill me later" case.

244
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:40,667
Our client, the ABC firm, out-sourced a key part

245
00:12:40,667 --> 00:12:42,876
of their business.

246
00:12:42,876 --> 00:12:44,542
Have been doing it many years.

247
00:12:44,626 --> 00:12:47,999
And the part of their business that they are out-sourcing is on a time

248
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:49,959
and materials basis.

249
00:12:50,083 --> 00:12:54,334
So there's a lot of invoices with ours and rates.

250
00:12:54,334 --> 00:12:55,667
And that's basically it.

251
00:12:55,667 --> 00:12:59,167
It was several million dollars a year on average that was being billed.

252
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:00,918
Our client started a review project

253
00:13:00,918 --> 00:13:03,999
because they thought they were being over billed.

254
00:13:03,999 --> 00:13:05,918
They thought there might be a little inflation and they wanted

255
00:13:05,918 --> 00:13:08,999
to figure out why things were looking inflated.

256
00:13:09,334 --> 00:13:11,167
They looked at some of the individual bills

257
00:13:11,167 --> 00:13:15,083
and thought things were taking a little bit too long.

258
00:13:15,083 --> 00:13:18,626
So we came in and we decided to help.

259
00:13:18,626 --> 00:13:22,959
So they had thousands and thousands and thousands of PDF format invoices.

260
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:24,792
That's not going to do us a lot of good.

261
00:13:25,292 --> 00:13:28,999
Even if we applied optical character recognition to it,

262
00:13:28,999 --> 00:13:31,751
we have unstructured data.

263
00:13:32,083 --> 00:13:35,751
I can search a few PDFs, but tens of thousands of them, it's you have

264
00:13:35,751 --> 00:13:38,083
to to do anything with that.

265
00:13:39,417 --> 00:13:41,999
We didn't have a lot of clues with this one.

266
00:13:42,417 --> 00:13:45,999
Through the magic of court order we were able to go

267
00:13:45,999 --> 00:13:49,999
to the customer's database, their network and get an image

268
00:13:49,999 --> 00:13:52,667
of everything in the network including

269
00:13:52,667 --> 00:13:54,999
a billing database.

270
00:13:55,417 --> 00:13:57,083
Which turned out to be very handy.

271
00:13:57,083 --> 00:13:59,501
We made a forensic copy of this database.

272
00:13:59,501 --> 00:14:02,918
It was not a -- it was in a proprietary format.

273
00:14:03,292 --> 00:14:07,125
In order for us to do forensic analysis in a database we need to get it

274
00:14:07,125 --> 00:14:09,667
into something like SQL where we can do

275
00:14:09,667 --> 00:14:11,709
standard queries.

276
00:14:11,709 --> 00:14:13,999
We migrated over and did standard queries.

277
00:14:14,334 --> 00:14:18,083
Looking at it, there's no way to compare the PDFs to the database.

278
00:14:19,999 --> 00:14:23,626
We decided to reverse engineer the tables in the database.

279
00:14:23,626 --> 00:14:25,792
Sometimes it's easy, but sometimes there are thousands

280
00:14:25,792 --> 00:14:28,250
and thousands of tables and when you don't have tech

281
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:31,751
support of developers, you have to figure it out.

282
00:14:31,751 --> 00:14:33,792
It's a slow, laborious process.

283
00:14:33,876 --> 00:14:34,999
We did figure it out.

284
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:36,751
We noticed that the audit logs were turned

285
00:14:36,751 --> 00:14:39,999
on in this which happened to be particularly useful.

286
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:42,999
So we ran a lot of queries and versus

287
00:14:42,999 --> 00:14:46,792
the time billed versus the audit logs.

288
00:14:46,792 --> 00:14:49,501
We found a pattern of inflation going on.

289
00:14:49,584 --> 00:14:52,125
Basically when you are billing on time and materials,

290
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:55,542
all you're doing is you've got either hours or you've got

291
00:14:55,542 --> 00:14:56,999
a rate.

292
00:14:56,999 --> 00:14:59,417
And those are the two things and they inflated.

293
00:14:59,584 --> 00:15:02,876
(Loud noise.)    ERIC ROBI: So these are

294
00:15:02,876 --> 00:15:07,709
the two things that you can change there.

295
00:15:07,709 --> 00:15:08,792
You can change time.

296
00:15:08,792 --> 00:15:10,751
Or you can change the rate.

297
00:15:10,999 --> 00:15:12,999
But we found the audit logs were turned

298
00:15:12,999 --> 00:15:16,999
off by default and the IT folks, bless the IT folks, they turned

299
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:19,167
the audit logs on which was helpful

300
00:15:19,167 --> 00:15:22,751
because we do a lot of database forensic cases and this

301
00:15:22,751 --> 00:15:26,999
is the only one where the audit logs were turned on.

302
00:15:26,999 --> 00:15:30,999
We were able to compare basically the amount that was billed at the end

303
00:15:30,999 --> 00:15:36,459
of the day versus how many hours were put out up to that point.

304
00:15:36,459 --> 00:15:38,083
We were able to see a chronology.

305
00:15:38,083 --> 00:15:40,626
Maybe at the end of the day the bill was for $1,000.

306
00:15:40,626 --> 00:15:43,834
But we saw it was only $800 actually billed.

307
00:15:43,834 --> 00:15:46,876
So the billing person, the database person who basically was

308
00:15:46,876 --> 00:15:49,250
working with it, this person would change

309
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:53,125
the hours and the rate sometimes and bump it up.

310
00:15:53,125 --> 00:15:55,999
Interest went from 800 to $1,000 on a typical invoice.

311
00:15:55,999 --> 00:15:59,667
They did this thousands and thousands and thousands of times.

312
00:16:00,083 --> 00:16:02,834
So let's look at the fail matrix.

313
00:16:03,125 --> 00:16:06,083
So I didn't give the user retard level too many points

314
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:09,292
here because it was a bill administrator.

315
00:16:09,292 --> 00:16:10,667
Most people don't know what is going on inside a database,

316
00:16:10,667 --> 00:16:12,417
most average people.

317
00:16:13,083 --> 00:16:16,501
However, they had to refund the money.

318
00:16:16,667 --> 00:16:18,501
So they get 18-point for that.

319
00:16:18,501 --> 00:16:19,999
MICHAEL PERKLIN: Over the last four or five years worth

320
00:16:19,999 --> 00:16:21,459
of money.

321
00:16:21,459 --> 00:16:22,959
It was a lot of money.

322
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:25,250
ERIC ROBI: It was about $12 million actually.

323
00:16:25,292 --> 00:16:27,501
They get 15 points.

324
00:16:27,501 --> 00:16:28,292
AUDIENCE: (Speaker away from microphone.)    ERIC ROBI:

325
00:16:28,292 --> 00:16:29,542
I wish!

326
00:16:30,125 --> 00:16:36,125
And bonus points, hmm, systematic culture of over billing.

327
00:16:36,209 --> 00:16:40,542
(Noise.)    MICHAEL PERKLIN: They get 45.

328
00:16:42,999 --> 00:16:45,501
ERIC ROBI: Okay.

329
00:16:46,209 --> 00:16:49,083
This next one, I call it "smokinggun.txt."

330
00:16:50,083 --> 00:16:53,959
If you work in the forensic arena, you probably heard

331
00:16:53,959 --> 00:16:56,918
the term the smokinggun.txt.

332
00:16:57,542 --> 00:16:58,999
It's the gag name of what you are always looking

333
00:16:58,999 --> 00:17:00,542
for in the case.

334
00:17:00,792 --> 00:17:02,999
It could be that record in the database.

335
00:17:02,999 --> 00:17:05,292
It could be that Internet history record that shows that

336
00:17:05,292 --> 00:17:08,209
the guy really did something bad.

337
00:17:08,209 --> 00:17:10,167
It comes from the cheesy western movies where

338
00:17:10,167 --> 00:17:13,542
the gun was smoking after he shot someone, and it proves

339
00:17:13,542 --> 00:17:15,626
he fired the shot.

340
00:17:17,584 --> 00:17:20,250
We say did you find the smoking gun?

341
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:22,083
Yeah, we found the smokinggun.txt.

342
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:25,083
Sometimes I wish it was as easy as finding smokinggun.txt.

343
00:17:28,584 --> 00:17:30,999
Another intellectual property case.

344
00:17:31,209 --> 00:17:35,834
You have a guy league one company to go to work for another company.

345
00:17:35,834 --> 00:17:38,542
The first company says can you make sure he didn't do stupid shit

346
00:17:38,542 --> 00:17:42,626
and we are called in to make sure he didn't do stupid shit.

347
00:17:43,125 --> 00:17:45,751
We imaged the drive.

348
00:17:45,751 --> 00:17:49,709
Kicked off the analysis script, like the script I told you guys

349
00:17:49,709 --> 00:17:51,667
about before.

350
00:17:51,918 --> 00:17:53,792
Opened up his desktop folder.

351
00:17:53,876 --> 00:17:58,292
I like to open up the desktop folder of every suspect I'm examining.

352
00:17:58,292 --> 00:18:01,876
You can tell a lot about what a guy, or a lot about the person when you're

353
00:18:01,876 --> 00:18:03,999
looking at the desktop.

354
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:07,626
Did they cram a lot of files in there in an unorganized fashion or everything

355
00:18:07,626 --> 00:18:10,918
is neatly packed away into my documents folder.

356
00:18:10,999 --> 00:18:12,417
Things like that.

357
00:18:12,584 --> 00:18:15,999
Are they arranged nicely or all spattered?

358
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:18,334
It tells you a little bit about the person.

359
00:18:18,334 --> 00:18:21,083
So you can get a little bit into the mind of who they are.

360
00:18:21,083 --> 00:18:23,792
Immediately I solved the case.

361
00:18:23,792 --> 00:18:26,999
MICHAEL PERKLIN: How did you do that?

362
00:18:26,999 --> 00:18:28,999
ERIC ROBI: Well, the smokinggun.txt.

363
00:18:29,083 --> 00:18:33,542
It was almost as easy as this.

364
00:18:33,542 --> 00:18:35,083
MICHAEL PERKLIN: A barbecue?

365
00:18:35,083 --> 00:18:40,334
ERIC ROBI: I opened up the desktop folder and I saw this.

366
00:18:41,459 --> 00:18:44,125
I'm hoping you can see that in the back.

367
00:18:44,999 --> 00:18:49,083
You have a folder on the desktop, the bottom left there.

368
00:18:49,083 --> 00:18:51,999
The folder is called Competitive Intelligence.

369
00:18:51,999 --> 00:18:54,751
(Laughter.)    ERIC ROBI: Inside that folder we've got

370
00:18:54,751 --> 00:18:59,083
a Power Point presentation titled "Project Blue Book."

371
00:19:01,584 --> 00:19:03,584
we've got some PDFs.

372
00:19:03,584 --> 00:19:05,709
We've got a whole bunch of stuff about this project Blue Book that this

373
00:19:05,709 --> 00:19:08,375
guy was working on from his old company.

374
00:19:08,375 --> 00:19:10,417
He was getting ready to deliver this presentation

375
00:19:10,417 --> 00:19:13,167
to the executive leadership team of the new company,

376
00:19:13,167 --> 00:19:16,167
telling them everything about this confidential project

377
00:19:16,167 --> 00:19:18,334
from his old company.

378
00:19:18,334 --> 00:19:24,334
(Groaning.)    ERIC ROBI: He didn't even make it difficult for me.

379
00:19:24,334 --> 00:19:26,999
Not only was all that stuff there, he made

380
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:31,667
a Power Point presentation describing it and to deliver all the knowledge

381
00:19:31,667 --> 00:19:33,918
for this to the LT.

382
00:19:35,417 --> 00:19:36,834
Yeah.

383
00:19:36,834 --> 00:19:37,999
So I just said that.

384
00:19:39,999 --> 00:19:42,542
Did you over bill for that?

385
00:19:42,542 --> 00:19:44,999
MICHAEL PERKLIN: We are not the last client.

386
00:19:44,999 --> 00:19:46,083
ERIC ROBI: All right.

387
00:19:46,083 --> 00:19:46,999
AUDIENCE: (Speaker away from microphone.)    ERIC ROBI:

388
00:19:46,999 --> 00:19:48,292
Pardon me?

389
00:19:48,292 --> 00:19:50,167
AUDIENCE: (Speaker away from microphone.)    MICHAEL

390
00:19:50,167 --> 00:19:52,709
PERKLIN: I don't even remember.

391
00:19:52,834 --> 00:19:55,792
Probably, well, it took 20 minutes.

392
00:19:55,792 --> 00:19:57,375
We probably just billed one hour.

393
00:19:57,375 --> 00:20:01,334
ERIC ROBI: Michael, what have we learned in this case?

394
00:20:01,334 --> 00:20:05,999
MICHAEL PERKLIN: Well, we learned that sometimes people don't

395
00:20:05,999 --> 00:20:07,709
even try.

396
00:20:10,959 --> 00:20:12,584
Fail matrix.

397
00:20:12,667 --> 00:20:15,209
User retard level has to be an 18.

398
00:20:15,292 --> 00:20:17,834
AUDIENCE: (Speaker away from microphone.)    MICHAEL

399
00:20:17,834 --> 00:20:20,334
PERKLIN: We are saving the higher scores for some

400
00:20:20,334 --> 00:20:22,459
of the later stories.

401
00:20:22,459 --> 00:20:27,083
ERIC ROBI: Numbers are going up, you may have noticed.

402
00:20:27,083 --> 00:20:29,959
MICHAEL PERKLIN: So far each one has been going up.

403
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,751
He got an 18 for user retard level.

404
00:20:32,999 --> 00:20:35,250
If you're going to be doing this, don't leave tracks

405
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:37,501
all over your computer.

406
00:20:37,501 --> 00:20:38,959
Sure if you're going to say they are going

407
00:20:38,959 --> 00:20:41,999
to be launching this new thing in August next year, it's one thing

408
00:20:41,999 --> 00:20:44,042
to say it to a person.

409
00:20:44,042 --> 00:20:44,584
If you put together a whole presentation

410
00:20:44,584 --> 00:20:46,334
to about the whole thing.

411
00:20:46,959 --> 00:20:47,999
That's a fail.

412
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:49,834
Punishment is ten.

413
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:51,959
He had to settle.

414
00:20:51,999 --> 00:20:57,834
Obviously in breach of his NDA from the old company and it cost him

415
00:20:57,834 --> 00:21:00,999
1.5 million in damages.

416
00:21:01,209 --> 00:21:04,250
So the distress caused is a six-pointer.

417
00:21:04,876 --> 00:21:07,959
Bonus points of 12 for zero effort.

418
00:21:08,083 --> 00:21:13,334
This all adds up to the fail matrix score of 46.

419
00:21:14,501 --> 00:21:15,999
Next story.

420
00:21:15,999 --> 00:21:18,667
ERIC ROBI: I hope you appreciate these amazing sound effects

421
00:21:18,667 --> 00:21:21,083
and video editing that I did.

422
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:23,334
MICHAEL PERKLIN: Hold on.

423
00:21:23,334 --> 00:21:25,375
We need to put the presentation on hold.

424
00:21:25,375 --> 00:21:26,375
I have a problem.

425
00:21:26,375 --> 00:21:27,375
Which one is which?

426
00:21:27,375 --> 00:21:29,709
ERIC ROBI: That one is mine on the let hand.

427
00:21:29,709 --> 00:21:32,876
MICHAEL PERKLIN: Really, because I want the one with more.

428
00:21:32,876 --> 00:21:34,918
ERIC ROBI: The one with yours is more.

429
00:21:34,918 --> 00:21:37,876
AUDIENCE: (Speaker away from microphone.)    ERIC ROBI: We

430
00:21:37,876 --> 00:21:41,501
will be taking questions later.

431
00:21:44,375 --> 00:21:45,626
All right.

432
00:21:45,626 --> 00:21:47,999
The next one I call hiding in the Cloud.

433
00:21:48,709 --> 00:21:51,918
So once again a top sales guy leaves a company

434
00:21:51,918 --> 00:21:55,999
and the sales just take a nose dive actually and they think

435
00:21:55,999 --> 00:22:00,334
he took the customer list but they can't prove it.

436
00:22:00,334 --> 00:22:03,083
They know that there's new customers.

437
00:22:03,083 --> 00:22:04,959
They know that there's old customers over at the new company

438
00:22:04,959 --> 00:22:07,834
but they can't prove he took the customer list.

439
00:22:07,999 --> 00:22:12,542
We image the computer and look for the usual clues.

440
00:22:12,999 --> 00:22:18,167
For example, link files are a Windows artifact that show what files

441
00:22:18,167 --> 00:22:21,209
have been recently opened.

442
00:22:21,209 --> 00:22:22,999
They are a simple text final and easily parsed and have a lot

443
00:22:22,999 --> 00:22:26,125
of information about the location of the file, the date and the time,

444
00:22:26,125 --> 00:22:28,501
all that kind of good stuff.

445
00:22:28,876 --> 00:22:32,667
We look at a registry key which I love the name of this.

446
00:22:32,667 --> 00:22:34,083
It makes no sense to me at all, but somebody

447
00:22:34,083 --> 00:22:37,250
in Microsoft maybe had a couple of these one day when we

448
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:38,999
were working.

449
00:22:38,999 --> 00:22:42,334
Bag MRU for some reason -- most recently used,

450
00:22:42,334 --> 00:22:44,334
but why bag?

451
00:22:44,334 --> 00:22:47,083
AUDIENCE: (Speaker away from microphone.)    ERIC ROBI: You

452
00:22:47,083 --> 00:22:49,876
guys are full of great answers.

453
00:22:49,876 --> 00:22:54,999
MICHAEL PERKLIN: You want to explain why it is named that?

454
00:22:54,999 --> 00:22:56,334
It's still a fucked up name.

455
00:22:58,999 --> 00:23:02,292
ERIC ROBI: It can show what files are inside a folder.

456
00:23:02,375 --> 00:23:05,792
That's what we typically look at in a file exfiltration case.

457
00:23:07,292 --> 00:23:10,709
This is from Vista forward you have jump lists.

458
00:23:11,083 --> 00:23:13,959
MICHAEL PERKLIN: That is a fail.

459
00:23:13,959 --> 00:23:15,375
It should say Vista.

460
00:23:18,334 --> 00:23:21,250
ERIC ROBI: I have to take a drink.

461
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:24,334
I don't love Vista in there to do it Wright.

462
00:23:24,334 --> 00:23:28,250
If you have five Word documents open and you click on it, you have the five,

463
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:31,250
those are jump lists basically.

464
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:33,083
IE history.

465
00:23:33,083 --> 00:23:34,083
Internet Explorer.

466
00:23:34,083 --> 00:23:36,083
Internet Explorer is so much morning exploring

467
00:23:36,083 --> 00:23:37,959
the Internet.

468
00:23:37,959 --> 00:23:40,667
It records things that you do without your knowledge,

469
00:23:40,667 --> 00:23:42,959
like opening files.

470
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:45,083
But we are getting no love.

471
00:23:45,417 --> 00:23:46,959
I'm not finding anything.

472
00:23:46,959 --> 00:23:47,999
Show me the love, baby.

473
00:23:48,125 --> 00:23:49,375
He's having a beer.

474
00:23:49,501 --> 00:23:54,209
So we search the IE history and we found a .JVM file pointing

475
00:23:54,209 --> 00:23:56,918
to files anywhere.

476
00:23:56,918 --> 00:23:58,709
Who is familiar with that site?

477
00:23:58,709 --> 00:24:00,918
It's very much like Dropbox.

478
00:24:01,083 --> 00:24:03,959
The same kind of concept but more for business users.

479
00:24:03,959 --> 00:24:07,876
It has a lot of really great auditing, logging, stuff like that.

480
00:24:07,876 --> 00:24:11,999
If you're uploading and downloading files, you can monitor and track them.

481
00:24:11,999 --> 00:24:14,459
That turned out to be a nice thing.

482
00:24:14,459 --> 00:24:17,083
Typically that's only in the user control file best

483
00:24:17,083 --> 00:24:22,250
of your recollection we found an HTM file and we solved the case.

484
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:23,250
Bingo!

485
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:25,999
ERIC ROBI: Timing fail, I'm sorry.

486
00:24:26,083 --> 00:24:28,083
Drink!

487
00:24:28,334 --> 00:24:30,292
Drink!

488
00:24:30,584 --> 00:24:34,918
ERIC ROBI: Bingo, we solved the case.

489
00:24:35,125 --> 00:24:36,125
All right.

490
00:24:36,125 --> 00:24:38,834
So what we got was the account ID, the upload times,

491
00:24:38,834 --> 00:24:41,751
the file names, everything.

492
00:24:41,751 --> 00:24:42,999
We got some sweet loving.

493
00:24:42,999 --> 00:24:44,626
We got stolen files.

494
00:24:44,626 --> 00:24:47,083
Let's look at JavaScript here.

495
00:24:47,584 --> 00:24:49,417
I changed the names of the file.

496
00:24:50,167 --> 00:24:55,459
We have recipe for Coke, minor trade secrets.

497
00:24:55,667 --> 00:24:58,083
The user is the user account name.

498
00:24:58,083 --> 00:25:00,083
So we were able to subpoena that from files anywhere and figure

499
00:25:00,083 --> 00:25:02,834
out who actually registered the account.

500
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:04,999
There is the folder that it was in.

501
00:25:05,417 --> 00:25:08,999
And this is really handy here, the date that it was uploaded.

502
00:25:09,209 --> 00:25:11,584
And we got a whole bunch of these.

503
00:25:11,584 --> 00:25:16,999
In fact this is the first page of an 80-page Excel report I prepared.

504
00:25:16,999 --> 00:25:19,542
These are all the file names that this guy uploaded.

505
00:25:22,999 --> 00:25:24,167
So yeah.

506
00:25:24,167 --> 00:25:26,542
The second part of the story is -- go back.

507
00:25:26,542 --> 00:25:27,542
Another fail.

508
00:25:27,542 --> 00:25:28,542
Fail!

509
00:25:28,542 --> 00:25:29,542
Drink!

510
00:25:29,542 --> 00:25:33,876
ERIC ROBI: Which one do I drink from?

511
00:25:33,959 --> 00:25:35,876
MICHAEL PERKLIN: Good answer.

512
00:25:35,999 --> 00:25:39,125
ERIC ROBI: The second part of the case, the opposing attorney,

513
00:25:39,125 --> 00:25:42,584
the guy representing the thief handed us ab an Outlook CD,

514
00:25:42,584 --> 00:25:44,667
Outlook PST on it.

515
00:25:44,667 --> 00:25:46,542
This is part of the discovery process.

516
00:25:46,542 --> 00:25:51,334
Discovery is a legal term in litigation where both sides are able

517
00:25:51,334 --> 00:25:54,083
to exchange evidence.

518
00:25:54,083 --> 00:25:55,417
In fact, they have, they are compelled to exchange evidence

519
00:25:55,417 --> 00:25:57,626
through the rules of the court.

520
00:25:57,751 --> 00:25:59,125
He gives us a CD.

521
00:25:59,709 --> 00:26:02,999
It has Outlook and Outlook PST on it.

522
00:26:03,083 --> 00:26:05,999
First thing we do, there's not a lot of files in there and

523
00:26:05,999 --> 00:26:11,167
the first thing we do, we want to recover the deleted e-mails in a PST.

524
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:14,125
We're forensic analysts and that's what we like doing, looking

525
00:26:14,125 --> 00:26:16,250
at people's e-mails.

526
00:26:17,292 --> 00:26:22,999
I'll show you the old school way of recovering deleted e-mails.

527
00:26:22,999 --> 00:26:26,999
You use a hex editor, crack open the PST and exchange bytes seven

528
00:26:26,999 --> 00:26:30,501
through 13, change them to zeros.

529
00:26:30,501 --> 00:26:31,959
Save the file.

530
00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:34,125
Then you use the Outlook repair tool built

531
00:26:34,125 --> 00:26:36,209
in with Microsoft.

532
00:26:36,334 --> 00:26:40,417
And you basically repair the tool -- sorry, repair the PST

533
00:26:40,417 --> 00:26:42,834
and what happens?

534
00:26:42,834 --> 00:26:45,459
You get a lot of e-mails back.

535
00:26:45,459 --> 00:26:47,083
These are not the actual e-mails, but you get tons and tons

536
00:26:47,083 --> 00:26:48,834
of e-mails back.

537
00:26:48,876 --> 00:26:54,501
In this case, we got tens of thousands of deleted e-mails.

538
00:26:54,667 --> 00:26:56,083
What was in these e-mails?

539
00:26:56,083 --> 00:26:59,083
Everything that completely turned the case around.

540
00:26:59,083 --> 00:27:00,667
Not only did we have this guy with all the uploads

541
00:27:00,667 --> 00:27:02,626
on the spreadsheets.

542
00:27:02,999 --> 00:27:06,375
We also had all the e-mails about who was involved.

543
00:27:06,375 --> 00:27:07,999
What lists he took.

544
00:27:07,999 --> 00:27:10,918
Who are the, you know, all the people that were involved.

545
00:27:11,167 --> 00:27:12,792
We were winning.

546
00:27:12,792 --> 00:27:14,999
We went to Charlie Sheen mode all of a sudden.

547
00:27:16,083 --> 00:27:20,334
And the funny thing is, we were able to take all this information and

548
00:27:20,334 --> 00:27:22,292
at a deposition.

549
00:27:22,292 --> 00:27:24,375
If you don't know what a deposition is, we get to ask questions

550
00:27:24,375 --> 00:27:26,375
of the opposing party.

551
00:27:26,459 --> 00:27:28,959
We are asking them, what happened?

552
00:27:28,999 --> 00:27:30,918
Did you guys steal anything?

553
00:27:30,918 --> 00:27:31,999
Did you take anything?

554
00:27:31,999 --> 00:27:32,999
No, no, no.

555
00:27:32,999 --> 00:27:37,459
We part pulling out these e-mails one by one by one.

556
00:27:37,459 --> 00:27:38,999
The guy turns white as a sheet.

557
00:27:38,999 --> 00:27:41,751
And he spills the beans.

558
00:27:41,918 --> 00:27:45,792
And basically, you know, we do pretty well.

559
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:48,125
Who deleted the mails, do you think in this case?

560
00:27:48,125 --> 00:27:49,125
Hmm?

561
00:27:49,125 --> 00:27:51,999
MICHAEL PERKLIN: Call it out if you think you know.

562
00:27:51,999 --> 00:27:52,083
AUDIENCE: (Speaker away from microphone.)    MICHAEL

563
00:27:52,083 --> 00:27:54,626
PERKLIN: Wow, people got it almost immediately.

564
00:27:59,999 --> 00:28:03,999
ERIC ROBI: They hired Saul Goodman, unfortunately.

565
00:28:05,167 --> 00:28:09,459
And yeah, he deleted the mails.

566
00:28:09,999 --> 00:28:11,167
Not a good thing.

567
00:28:11,167 --> 00:28:12,167
Not a good thing.

568
00:28:12,167 --> 00:28:13,250
What have we learned?

569
00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:15,999
AUDIENCE: (Speaker away from microphone.)    MICHAEL

570
00:28:15,999 --> 00:28:21,542
PERKLIN: The question is, did he claim privilege on the e-mails?

571
00:28:21,542 --> 00:28:23,792
ERIC ROBI: He claimed privilege on some of them, but not

572
00:28:23,792 --> 00:28:26,626
all of the 10,000 that he deleted.

573
00:28:27,167 --> 00:28:30,834
IE history is difficult to wipe.

574
00:28:31,083 --> 00:28:33,501
It seems to leave stuff behind.

575
00:28:37,999 --> 00:28:41,125
We learned a new file type, the Java file type,

576
00:28:41,125 --> 00:28:44,999
JavaScript files can give us love, too.

577
00:28:44,999 --> 00:28:45,999
We like them.

578
00:28:45,999 --> 00:28:48,667
And uploading files still leaves traces.

579
00:28:48,667 --> 00:28:51,334
So attorneys shouldn't mess with evidence.

580
00:28:51,334 --> 00:28:53,417
It's against the ethical rules in every state and probably every

581
00:28:53,417 --> 00:28:56,501
Canadian province and can get you disbarred.

582
00:28:56,501 --> 00:28:58,542
AUDIENCE: Did they in this case?

583
00:28:58,709 --> 00:29:00,667
Let's look at the fail matrix.

584
00:29:02,083 --> 00:29:06,125
ERIC ROBI: User retard level is damn high on this one.

585
00:29:06,125 --> 00:29:10,125
Fails on the attorney's part and also on the ex-sales guy.

586
00:29:10,209 --> 00:29:11,999
Huge lawsuit.

587
00:29:11,999 --> 00:29:15,999
Three and a half million dollars in fees and damages.

588
00:29:15,999 --> 00:29:20,334
(Whistling.)    ERIC ROBI: Which our client all got back basically

589
00:29:20,334 --> 00:29:22,959
and 15 bonus points.

590
00:29:22,959 --> 00:29:25,292
The attorney might lose his license on this one.

591
00:29:25,292 --> 00:29:26,292
He hasn't yet.

592
00:29:26,292 --> 00:29:27,999
We don't track that kind of stuff.

593
00:29:27,999 --> 00:29:30,999
(Buzzer.)    ERIC ROBI: Fifty-one, we're moving up.

594
00:29:33,375 --> 00:29:34,834
You ready?

595
00:29:34,834 --> 00:29:36,292
MICHAEL PERKLIN: Oh, right.

596
00:29:36,292 --> 00:29:37,292
Fail!

597
00:29:37,292 --> 00:29:38,292
Drink!

598
00:29:38,292 --> 00:29:39,959
MICHAEL PERKLIN: All right.

599
00:29:47,584 --> 00:29:49,125
Let's do this shit.

600
00:29:49,125 --> 00:29:50,751
ERIC ROBI: That's winning.

601
00:29:50,751 --> 00:29:51,834
MICHAEL PERKLIN: This next case is probably one

602
00:29:51,834 --> 00:29:54,959
of the most fun cases I've worked on.

603
00:29:55,292 --> 00:29:57,209
From the start I could tell that something -- it

604
00:29:57,209 --> 00:29:59,584
was going to be a fun one.

605
00:29:59,751 --> 00:30:01,000
The RBT bounce.

606
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
You'll see why.

607
00:30:02,250 --> 00:30:05,083
I was called in to investigate a network breach.

608
00:30:05,417 --> 00:30:08,334
The company shared information with us that was evidence that

609
00:30:08,334 --> 00:30:11,626
at least one computer had been breached.

610
00:30:11,626 --> 00:30:13,125
They didn't know why.

611
00:30:13,125 --> 00:30:14,292
They didn't know what.

612
00:30:14,292 --> 00:30:16,999
Asked us to investigate and to tell them why and what.

613
00:30:17,999 --> 00:30:20,459
It was a large company.

614
00:30:20,459 --> 00:30:24,959
They had a lot of computers, all of them were Windows based.

615
00:30:24,999 --> 00:30:27,584
Thousands upon thousands of computers in offices

616
00:30:27,584 --> 00:30:30,709
all across the world and in one of their offices

617
00:30:30,709 --> 00:30:34,584
they noticed this computer had been breached.

618
00:30:34,584 --> 00:30:37,334
So let's figure out what happened.

619
00:30:37,542 --> 00:30:38,709
So we move in.

620
00:30:38,709 --> 00:30:42,918
And actually I think I'm going to pause here for two seconds.

621
00:30:42,999 --> 00:30:46,083
Eric, is this your first time presenting at DEF CON?

622
00:30:46,083 --> 00:30:47,334
ERIC ROBI: Yes, it is.

623
00:30:47,334 --> 00:30:49,375
(Laughter.)    MICHAEL PERKLIN: Okay.

624
00:30:55,876 --> 00:30:57,959
(Applause.)    MICHAEL PERKLIN: We don't even have

625
00:30:57,959 --> 00:30:59,918
to say anything anymore.

626
00:30:59,918 --> 00:31:01,876
You guys know exactly what is going on.

627
00:31:01,876 --> 00:31:02,918
ERIC ROBI: Uh-oh.

628
00:31:02,999 --> 00:31:08,999
MICHAEL PERKLIN: I want to know, is Sarah in the room?

629
00:31:08,999 --> 00:31:09,999
Show yourself!

630
00:31:09,999 --> 00:31:10,999
Which Sarah?

631
00:31:10,999 --> 00:31:13,626
Narrow it down?

632
00:31:13,999 --> 00:31:19,999
(Overlapping speakers.)    MICHAEL PERKLIN: Is your name Sarah?

633
00:31:21,417 --> 00:31:22,999
Bend over.

634
00:31:22,999 --> 00:31:26,375
(Laughter.)    We are just going to leave now.

635
00:31:26,375 --> 00:31:28,083
You are the ugliest Sarah ever.

636
00:31:28,292 --> 00:31:30,501
Fail!

637
00:31:31,999 --> 00:31:34,584
Another soldier bites the dust.

638
00:31:36,626 --> 00:31:37,999
Winning!

639
00:31:39,999 --> 00:31:44,083
(Laughter.)    Stop that.

640
00:31:44,083 --> 00:31:47,083
The path to recovery is --    Paul, there's some issue

641
00:31:47,083 --> 00:31:49,709
about the sound person?

642
00:31:50,876 --> 00:31:52,584
No.

643
00:31:52,751 --> 00:31:54,876
Sarah is supposed to be the sound person.

644
00:31:54,876 --> 00:31:55,999
Sarah is right here.

645
00:31:56,375 --> 00:31:57,999
You are talking about me, right?

646
00:31:57,999 --> 00:32:01,959
I appreciate that, Sarah, but we're looking for a different person.

647
00:32:01,959 --> 00:32:04,334
Since she is not here, Sarah, would you come up?

648
00:32:04,334 --> 00:32:05,334
Come up.

649
00:32:05,334 --> 00:32:07,751
You're the next contestant on: Will you fail?

650
00:32:17,167 --> 00:32:18,999
Thank you.

651
00:32:19,292 --> 00:32:22,334
The other Sarah is going to be pissed.

652
00:32:22,334 --> 00:32:27,626
You want to go around that way?

653
00:32:27,626 --> 00:32:28,792
You already got one.

654
00:32:28,792 --> 00:32:29,999
Someone counted wrong!

655
00:32:29,999 --> 00:32:30,999
Pass one to Sarah.

656
00:32:30,999 --> 00:32:31,999
All right.

657
00:32:31,999 --> 00:32:32,999
A double.

658
00:32:32,999 --> 00:32:36,876
(Laughter.)    Find Sarah --    I'm sure all of you want to be Sarah right now.

659
00:32:36,876 --> 00:32:39,999
To our new speakers and new attendees!

660
00:32:43,999 --> 00:32:45,999
(Applause.)    Whew!

661
00:32:49,999 --> 00:32:51,626
Uh-oh.

662
00:32:51,626 --> 00:32:52,626
How many more talks?

663
00:32:52,626 --> 00:32:53,626
Thank you.

664
00:32:53,626 --> 00:32:55,083
Two more this hour.

665
00:32:55,083 --> 00:32:57,083
MICHAEL PERKLIN: All right.

666
00:32:57,083 --> 00:32:58,834
We have 15 minutes left.

667
00:32:58,834 --> 00:33:00,999
Is Sarah in the next --    MICHAEL PERKLIN:

668
00:33:00,999 --> 00:33:04,959
Thank you very much, goons, for doing that.

669
00:33:04,959 --> 00:33:07,083
It's Eric's first time at DEF CON.

670
00:33:10,999 --> 00:33:13,999
So I was talking with the RDP bounce case that I

671
00:33:13,999 --> 00:33:16,083
was investigating.

672
00:33:16,083 --> 00:33:19,918
As I mentioned, thousands of computers, various offices

673
00:33:19,918 --> 00:33:22,584
all around the world.

674
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:23,999
So we analyze the one computer that

675
00:33:23,999 --> 00:33:25,959
they knew was breached.

676
00:33:25,959 --> 00:33:30,083
And it showed that RDP or remote desktop property call.

677
00:33:30,083 --> 00:33:31,542
This is the tool in Windows that allows you

678
00:33:31,542 --> 00:33:34,626
to remotely control another computer.

679
00:33:34,626 --> 00:33:38,125
Some logs showed us that RDP was used to connect using

680
00:33:38,125 --> 00:33:42,709
the local administrator password to another machine.

681
00:33:42,999 --> 00:33:47,999
It also showed that -- actually I said it backwards.

682
00:33:47,999 --> 00:33:49,999
RDP was used to connect in and also showed that RDP was used

683
00:33:49,999 --> 00:33:51,751
to connect out.

684
00:33:51,876 --> 00:33:55,999
In this diagram I was looking at the middle computer.

685
00:33:55,999 --> 00:33:58,834
I didn't know at the time there were other computers.

686
00:33:58,834 --> 00:34:00,250
I was looking at the middle one.

687
00:34:00,250 --> 00:34:02,999
It seemed like there were a bunched used in here.

688
00:34:03,417 --> 00:34:05,999
It was probably the tip of the iceberg.

689
00:34:06,417 --> 00:34:09,083
ERIC ROBI: Where do you find these logs, Michael?

690
00:34:09,083 --> 00:34:09,459
MICHAEL PERKLIN: Specifically I was looking

691
00:34:09,459 --> 00:34:11,876
at the Windows event viewer.

692
00:34:12,626 --> 00:34:15,834
Go into the control panel and the administrator tools.

693
00:34:16,083 --> 00:34:19,999
It logs by default a lot of stuff in there including when RDP is used

694
00:34:19,999 --> 00:34:23,918
to connect in and when you're connecting out.

695
00:34:24,209 --> 00:34:28,626
So I analyzed that machine that came before it.

696
00:34:28,626 --> 00:34:29,751
And same thing.

697
00:34:29,834 --> 00:34:34,417
There were logs that showed that somebody was connecting into that.

698
00:34:34,417 --> 00:34:36,999
It was basically an entire bounce.

699
00:34:36,999 --> 00:34:41,459
Now, these computers were located in different offices all around the world.

700
00:34:41,459 --> 00:34:45,751
This guy was bouncing all around the world to do something.

701
00:34:45,751 --> 00:34:47,709
So obviously this is a pattern.

702
00:34:47,709 --> 00:34:49,834
I still didn't know what he was doing.

703
00:34:49,834 --> 00:34:52,209
I just knew that he was clearly going through a lot

704
00:34:52,209 --> 00:34:56,918
of trouble to obfuscate his trail, bouncing all around.

705
00:34:56,918 --> 00:34:59,918
Probably so that when he does hit his final target there's no

706
00:34:59,918 --> 00:35:03,375
direct evidence to where he was coming from.

707
00:35:04,918 --> 00:35:08,209
AUDIENCE: Were they sessions within sessions?

708
00:35:09,125 --> 00:35:12,292
MICHAEL PERKLIN: Yes, within the remote desktop,

709
00:35:12,292 --> 00:35:14,999
he did this over and over.

710
00:35:15,584 --> 00:35:18,999
Remote desktop is not the fastest protocol at all.

711
00:35:19,209 --> 00:35:22,083
I don't want to speculate how long it took him

712
00:35:22,083 --> 00:35:23,959
to do this.

713
00:35:23,959 --> 00:35:26,292
ERIC ROBI: Can you imagine how long the screen redraw was

714
00:35:26,292 --> 00:35:29,167
by the time you get to machine ten?

715
00:35:29,167 --> 00:35:31,542
MICHAEL PERKLIN: Jesus Christ, you have to click a minute

716
00:35:31,542 --> 00:35:33,999
between clicks or something.

717
00:35:35,751 --> 00:35:37,375
What was the target?

718
00:35:37,375 --> 00:35:41,334
So I think you can all figure out what I do next.

719
00:35:41,334 --> 00:35:44,918
Rather than following the trail back, I followed the trail forward.

720
00:35:44,918 --> 00:35:45,959
What was he getting?

721
00:35:46,083 --> 00:35:48,999
Step after step, computer after computer.

722
00:35:48,999 --> 00:35:51,918
Site after site after site all around the world.

723
00:35:52,083 --> 00:35:54,417
I finally reached a high profile machine.

724
00:35:54,584 --> 00:35:58,209
I wish I could tell you which specific machine it was.

725
00:35:58,417 --> 00:36:03,292
I can't because it would give away too much about this company.

726
00:36:03,292 --> 00:36:04,292
Prism?

727
00:36:04,334 --> 00:36:08,292
ERIC ROBI: Did it have Nickel Back on it?

728
00:36:08,292 --> 00:36:12,375
MICHAEL PERKLIN: Chalkiest video ever.

729
00:36:14,375 --> 00:36:18,918
I knew what he was going after when I reached that machine.

730
00:36:18,918 --> 00:36:20,709
He wanted confidential documents that were only on this one machine

731
00:36:20,709 --> 00:36:22,626
in the entire company.

732
00:36:22,999 --> 00:36:25,542
He obviously knew that and he wanted to get into the machine

733
00:36:25,542 --> 00:36:27,542
to get these documents.

734
00:36:28,083 --> 00:36:30,999
I focused the analysis on this target machine,

735
00:36:30,999 --> 00:36:36,501
on this special confidential machine and I wanted to see what did they do?

736
00:36:36,501 --> 00:36:38,584
Specifically which files did they take?

737
00:36:38,999 --> 00:36:42,459
And it took me only about two minutes.

738
00:36:42,459 --> 00:36:44,667
As I was analyzing this machine.

739
00:36:44,667 --> 00:36:47,209
I identified the attacker immediately.

740
00:36:47,334 --> 00:36:49,334
He went through all around the world.

741
00:36:49,334 --> 00:36:51,083
Finally when I was taking a look at his target,

742
00:36:51,083 --> 00:36:54,125
within two minutes I found out who he was.

743
00:36:54,125 --> 00:36:56,083
AUDIENCE: (Speaker away from microphone.)    MICHAEL

744
00:36:56,083 --> 00:36:59,584
PERKLIN: He used his own credentials on the machine?

745
00:36:59,584 --> 00:37:02,209
No, he didn't use his own credentials on the machine.

746
00:37:02,209 --> 00:37:03,375
E-mails to himself?

747
00:37:03,375 --> 00:37:05,918
MICHAEL PERKLIN: No.

748
00:37:06,083 --> 00:37:08,209
He stole his own file?

749
00:37:08,209 --> 00:37:11,459
MICHAEL PERKLIN: No, and he did not check Facebook

750
00:37:11,459 --> 00:37:13,999
and no share drives.

751
00:37:13,999 --> 00:37:15,501
Why don't I tell you what he did?

752
00:37:15,501 --> 00:37:18,959
ERIC ROBI: Michael, what did he do?

753
00:37:18,959 --> 00:37:21,083
MICHAEL PERKLIN: Printers.

754
00:37:24,918 --> 00:37:26,999
One thing a lot of people don't know

755
00:37:26,999 --> 00:37:29,209
about remote desktop, by default it maps

756
00:37:29,209 --> 00:37:31,417
the printer connected to your machine

757
00:37:31,417 --> 00:37:35,083
to the machine that you are connecting out to.

758
00:37:35,083 --> 00:37:38,292
It does this so that when you hit print inside your remote desktop window

759
00:37:38,292 --> 00:37:41,167
your printer next to you is available so you can print

760
00:37:41,167 --> 00:37:43,501
a document besides you.

761
00:37:43,501 --> 00:37:47,709
This guy didn't print any documents but just by connecting

762
00:37:47,709 --> 00:37:53,584
the machine automatically mapped his local printer to the target machine,

763
00:37:53,584 --> 00:37:57,250
which identified his machine name.

764
00:37:57,584 --> 00:37:59,083
He forgot to turn this off.

765
00:37:59,501 --> 00:38:02,334
There is a check box in remote desktop protocol when you

766
00:38:02,334 --> 00:38:06,876
open up the RDP window, unmap printers to unmap printers.

767
00:38:06,876 --> 00:38:10,083
And it's a check box and he did not map it.

768
00:38:10,083 --> 00:38:15,083
ERIC ROBI: What have re logged Michael?

769
00:38:15,083 --> 00:38:17,292
MICHAEL PERKLIN: What have we learned?

770
00:38:19,584 --> 00:38:22,417
Documents logged by inside -- can give insight

771
00:38:22,417 --> 00:38:24,584
into user actions.

772
00:38:25,834 --> 00:38:27,999
The system did this automatically.

773
00:38:28,501 --> 00:38:30,918
By looking at the system is doing can tell what you

774
00:38:30,918 --> 00:38:32,918
the user is doing.

775
00:38:32,999 --> 00:38:35,876
For the fail matrix, user retard level would be

776
00:38:35,876 --> 00:38:38,959
about a 20 because he went through a lot of trouble

777
00:38:38,959 --> 00:38:42,999
to cover his tracks and he did not cover his tracks.

778
00:38:43,083 --> 00:38:45,083
Punishment level would be 15.

779
00:38:45,083 --> 00:38:46,083
He loss his job.

780
00:38:46,083 --> 00:38:48,083
He also lost his references.

781
00:38:48,167 --> 00:38:51,292
He can't use that company as a reference anymore.

782
00:38:51,792 --> 00:38:54,167
So distress caused would be 8.

783
00:38:54,167 --> 00:38:56,083
Bonus points would be 20.

784
00:38:56,083 --> 00:38:57,209
Do some research.

785
00:38:57,209 --> 00:39:02,334
If you are going to use RDP to pull off a scam, know how RDP works.

786
00:39:02,626 --> 00:39:08,999
Adding it all up, we have a fail score of 63.

787
00:39:08,999 --> 00:39:10,292
Last story, Eric.

788
00:39:10,292 --> 00:39:13,417
ERIC ROBI: All right.

789
00:39:13,417 --> 00:39:16,417
So the last story is a little bit different than the others.

790
00:39:16,417 --> 00:39:21,792
(Laughter.)    ERIC ROBI: This is the epic porno fail.

791
00:39:21,792 --> 00:39:22,959
The difference in this one, all together

792
00:39:22,959 --> 00:39:26,083
the cases we have talked about have been commercial litigation,

793
00:39:26,083 --> 00:39:29,167
civil litigation, something on this side.

794
00:39:29,167 --> 00:39:31,125
This one happens to be a criminal case.

795
00:39:31,709 --> 00:39:33,999
From time to time we do criminal defense work.

796
00:39:34,083 --> 00:39:35,999
And we work either with Public Defenders

797
00:39:35,999 --> 00:39:37,999
or private attorneys.

798
00:39:37,999 --> 00:39:40,209
This is about this kind of situation.

799
00:39:40,209 --> 00:39:42,751
So our client, Edgar, has been charged with possession

800
00:39:42,751 --> 00:39:46,334
of contra band, aka child porn in his computer.

801
00:39:48,083 --> 00:39:51,834
He claims innocence and I roll my eyes because everybody always

802
00:39:51,834 --> 00:39:53,834
claims innocence.

803
00:39:54,083 --> 00:39:57,083
98 percent of these people did it.

804
00:39:57,999 --> 00:39:59,999
We examine the computer.

805
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,918
We looked at the examiners report.

806
00:40:01,918 --> 00:40:03,292
We looked at the allegations.

807
00:40:03,292 --> 00:40:04,626
Let's take a look at them.

808
00:40:04,626 --> 00:40:09,167
So they claim Edgar downloaded porn.

809
00:40:09,999 --> 00:40:11,167
All right?

810
00:40:11,167 --> 00:40:14,083
They claim that Edgar's user account had passwords.

811
00:40:14,542 --> 00:40:16,999
This is all documented in the record.

812
00:40:16,999 --> 00:40:21,876
They claim that Edgar utilized news groups to download porn, like for real?

813
00:40:21,876 --> 00:40:23,999
Who uses news groups to download porn?

814
00:40:23,999 --> 00:40:28,792
I think they have the -- (Overlapping speakers.)    ERIC

815
00:40:28,792 --> 00:40:32,999
ROBI: Yeah, news groups, right?

816
00:40:32,999 --> 00:40:34,417
AUDIENCE: Pregger porn.

817
00:40:34,417 --> 00:40:39,626
ERIC ROBI: That guy I would believe.

818
00:40:41,375 --> 00:40:44,209
They allege that he downloaded illegal porn.

819
00:40:44,459 --> 00:40:45,999
There is one thing to note.

820
00:40:45,999 --> 00:40:46,999
Keep this in mind.

821
00:40:47,125 --> 00:40:49,375
He left his house on April 2012.

822
00:40:49,375 --> 00:40:52,209
His wife kicked him out because of this stuff happening.

823
00:40:52,292 --> 00:40:53,792
April 2012.

824
00:40:53,792 --> 00:40:54,999
Keep that in mind.

825
00:40:55,501 --> 00:40:58,292
So let's look when we examine the computer.

826
00:40:58,292 --> 00:41:00,292
Let's see what we came up with.

827
00:41:00,292 --> 00:41:02,334
First we looked at IE history.

828
00:41:02,959 --> 00:41:05,542
As I mentioned before, IE history is able to show you when

829
00:41:05,542 --> 00:41:07,834
a file has been opened.

830
00:41:07,834 --> 00:41:11,125
This is an actual example, I changed the file name a little bit here.

831
00:41:11,125 --> 00:41:12,999
What was the date I just mentioned?

832
00:41:12,999 --> 00:41:15,375
AUDIENCE: April 2012.

833
00:41:15,375 --> 00:41:16,999
ERIC ROBI: April 2012.

834
00:41:16,999 --> 00:41:18,667
I see some dates here.

835
00:41:18,876 --> 00:41:21,375
Are these before or after April 2012?

836
00:41:21,375 --> 00:41:23,083
Put up your hand if it's after?

837
00:41:23,751 --> 00:41:25,292
Ahh!

838
00:41:25,876 --> 00:41:26,876
Yes.

839
00:41:26,876 --> 00:41:28,125
So all right.

840
00:41:28,125 --> 00:41:29,459
One fail here.

841
00:41:30,083 --> 00:41:34,834
Let's look at his peer to peer software download folder.

842
00:41:34,834 --> 00:41:38,459
In the top there I've got the path where these naughty files were

843
00:41:38,459 --> 00:41:42,167
downloaded and it's a pretty typical path.

844
00:41:42,167 --> 00:41:46,501
These P to P programs change the name to something long.

845
00:41:46,501 --> 00:41:47,751
It's like T-something something something

846
00:41:47,751 --> 00:41:49,292
naughty file.

847
00:41:49,667 --> 00:41:52,125
I'm looking at the dates here again.

848
00:41:52,751 --> 00:41:54,292
Michael, do you have a calendar?

849
00:41:54,292 --> 00:41:56,459
MICHAEL PERKLIN: Give me a second here.

850
00:41:56,459 --> 00:41:57,999
ERIC ROBI: When is December?

851
00:41:57,999 --> 00:41:59,999
MICHAEL PERKLIN: It is after April.

852
00:42:00,501 --> 00:42:02,250
Definitely after April.

853
00:42:02,250 --> 00:42:04,375
ERIC ROBI: Okay, just wanted to check.

854
00:42:04,375 --> 00:42:07,667
We need to verify our forensic findings before we publish them.

855
00:42:07,667 --> 00:42:08,834
We're verifying.

856
00:42:08,918 --> 00:42:09,999
Oops.

857
00:42:09,999 --> 00:42:13,292
I think --    MICHAEL PERKLIN: Fail!

858
00:42:13,292 --> 00:42:14,292
ERIC ROBI: Fail.

859
00:42:14,292 --> 00:42:15,417
Give me that beer.

860
00:42:20,709 --> 00:42:22,083
All right.

861
00:42:22,083 --> 00:42:24,999
They also claim that he used Outlook express.

862
00:42:24,999 --> 00:42:26,250
Really, to download porn.

863
00:42:27,876 --> 00:42:29,417
Outlook express.

864
00:42:29,417 --> 00:42:31,751
This is 2012, remember, folks.

865
00:42:31,751 --> 00:42:32,542
MICHAEL PERKLIN: Makes you wonder, did

866
00:42:32,542 --> 00:42:34,959
they even analyze this guy's machine?

867
00:42:35,375 --> 00:42:39,292
We saw records of P to P, not Outlook express.

868
00:42:39,292 --> 00:42:42,083
ERIC ROBI: Outlook express, all right.

869
00:42:42,375 --> 00:42:45,751
In reality, yes, Outlook express was on the machine set

870
00:42:45,751 --> 00:42:48,999
up with an account called porno lover.

871
00:42:50,959 --> 00:42:52,292
Okay?

872
00:42:52,626 --> 00:42:56,250
It was set up after Edgar moved out of the house.

873
00:42:56,334 --> 00:42:59,584
And only headers were downloaded.

874
00:42:59,584 --> 00:43:00,626
No content.

875
00:43:00,626 --> 00:43:02,999
MICHAEL PERKLIN: What do you mean by headers?

876
00:43:02,999 --> 00:43:05,751
ERIC ROBI: A header, if you're using Outlook express, it

877
00:43:05,751 --> 00:43:09,334
is just the first part of the file.

878
00:43:09,459 --> 00:43:12,209
The e-mail is going to have the date, the send to, the receiver,

879
00:43:12,209 --> 00:43:15,626
the subject line, make the first couple words.

880
00:43:15,999 --> 00:43:17,209
There was no content.

881
00:43:17,209 --> 00:43:20,999
There was no photos in there, just headers with, you know,

882
00:43:20,999 --> 00:43:23,999
admittedly porno names.

883
00:43:23,999 --> 00:43:26,501
Also, let's look at accusation three.

884
00:43:26,542 --> 00:43:29,792
They said his user account had a password.

885
00:43:30,125 --> 00:43:33,334
The inference is only Edgar was able to access it

886
00:43:33,334 --> 00:43:36,167
because there was a password.

887
00:43:36,709 --> 00:43:39,999
Let's look at the password, shall we?

888
00:43:40,626 --> 00:43:44,125
Maybe we can zoom in a little bit on this.

889
00:43:44,125 --> 00:43:49,751
(Laughter.)    ERIC ROBI: This is actually a cool utility the it's free.

890
00:43:49,751 --> 00:43:50,751
It's LCP.

891
00:43:50,751 --> 00:43:52,083
I'll go back to it here.

892
00:43:52,083 --> 00:43:59,999
It's a free utility, great for looking and seeing if there are passwords.

893
00:43:59,999 --> 00:44:03,999
You can also use it to perform an attack, although it's not very good.

894
00:44:05,751 --> 00:44:06,999
All right.

895
00:44:06,999 --> 00:44:09,667
So more facts undiscovered by the examiner.

896
00:44:10,584 --> 00:44:13,459
The P to P client was used to download porn.

897
00:44:13,459 --> 00:44:15,375
The examiner didn't find that.

898
00:44:15,709 --> 00:44:18,876
Into a new user account called porno lover.

899
00:44:19,584 --> 00:44:20,999
Guess when?

900
00:44:21,083 --> 00:44:22,999
After he moved out of the house.

901
00:44:24,334 --> 00:44:27,292
So we submitted our report to the prosecutor.

902
00:44:27,292 --> 00:44:30,209
Looks like a five, ten-page report, something like that.

903
00:44:30,209 --> 00:44:32,999
The government dropped the charges, years after they charged this guy,

904
00:44:32,999 --> 00:44:35,209
they dropped the charges.

905
00:44:35,209 --> 00:44:37,417
This does not ever happen really.

906
00:44:37,999 --> 00:44:39,792
This is the first time.

907
00:44:39,792 --> 00:44:41,584
I've done thousands of cases -- well, hundreds of cases,

908
00:44:41,584 --> 00:44:43,501
thousands of exams.

909
00:44:43,876 --> 00:44:46,334
I don't know how many, it's never happened before.

910
00:44:46,501 --> 00:44:50,542
This is after the guy spent a huge amount of money on legal costs.

911
00:44:50,959 --> 00:44:54,209
So to do all this, I just want to give a thank you to Rob Lee

912
00:44:54,209 --> 00:44:57,083
and SANs -- you know Rob Lee?

913
00:44:57,209 --> 00:44:59,709
We used super timeline for this analysis.

914
00:45:06,834 --> 00:45:09,584
That's a super piece of -- (Lost audio.)    MICHAEL

915
00:45:09,584 --> 00:45:13,959
PERKLIN: Definitely one of the best pieces of software used.

916
00:45:13,959 --> 00:45:17,292
ERIC ROBI: So the government interviews

917
00:45:17,292 --> 00:45:19,876
Edgar's friend.

918
00:45:20,501 --> 00:45:22,334
The friend confesses.

919
00:45:22,959 --> 00:45:24,876
The friend did it.

920
00:45:24,876 --> 00:45:27,751
The friend was trying to get jiggy with Edgar's wife.

921
00:45:27,751 --> 00:45:31,999
(Groans.)    ERIC ROBI: And he put the porn on the computer.

922
00:45:32,584 --> 00:45:35,167
The court clears Edgar's name.

923
00:45:35,167 --> 00:45:37,209
They give him an finding of innocence.

924
00:45:37,209 --> 00:45:38,501
Rarely happens.

925
00:45:43,999 --> 00:45:47,083
I have been to court a couple times where there have been

926
00:45:47,083 --> 00:45:50,584
acquittals and we didn't go to court on this one, fortunately,

927
00:45:50,584 --> 00:45:52,542
but we would have.

928
00:45:52,876 --> 00:45:54,999
So what did we learn?

929
00:45:54,999 --> 00:45:57,918
Base your conclusions upon actual evidence.

930
00:45:58,459 --> 00:46:02,292
Find multiple artifacts backing up your allegations.

931
00:46:02,292 --> 00:46:04,876
I don't know where the password thing came from.

932
00:46:04,876 --> 00:46:07,999
Tie it to a person, not just a machine if possible.

933
00:46:07,999 --> 00:46:12,542
Try to use at user activity that would tie expect events to a person.

934
00:46:12,834 --> 00:46:14,709
Remember, the maximum you can get is 20

935
00:46:14,709 --> 00:46:16,417
in any category.

936
00:46:17,125 --> 00:46:21,792
However, I have decided to break the rules a little bit for this one.

937
00:46:21,792 --> 00:46:24,083
Examiner ineptness, he gets five bonus points built

938
00:46:24,083 --> 00:46:25,999
in right there.

939
00:46:26,999 --> 00:46:29,999
Oh, yeah, the guy sued the city for millions of dollars.

940
00:46:30,999 --> 00:46:34,918
And you know, there might be a job security issue for somebody

941
00:46:34,918 --> 00:46:36,667
in this case.

942
00:46:36,667 --> 00:46:38,417
MICHAEL PERKLIN: I don't think that examiner is really going to have

943
00:46:38,417 --> 00:46:40,083
a job much longer.

944
00:46:40,083 --> 00:46:42,999
ERIC ROBI: One hundred bonus points because the court finds

945
00:46:42,999 --> 00:46:45,292
the suspect innocent.

946
00:46:45,999 --> 00:46:47,792
Factually innocent.

947
00:46:47,792 --> 00:46:50,999
(Buzzer.) (Music playing.)    ERIC ROBI: Thank you very much!

948
00:46:50,999 --> 00:46:53,083
MICHAEL PERKLIN: Thank you, everybody!

949
00:46:53,083 --> 00:46:56,250
If you want to do Q&A, we're going over to the Chill-Out Lounge.
