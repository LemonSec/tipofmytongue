1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,584
THE DARK TANGENT: All right,

2
00:00:11,584 --> 00:00:13,167
We're going to try something new.

3
00:00:13,167 --> 00:00:15,292
It's going to be kind of a shocker

4
00:00:15,292 --> 00:00:17,959
It's something we haven't really done

5
00:00:17,959 --> 00:00:19,334
It's called starting on time.

6
00:00:19,792 --> 00:00:21,042
(Laughter).

7
00:00:21,542 --> 00:00:22,999
(Cheers).

8
00:00:23,292 --> 00:00:25,209
And we've you are going

9
00:00:25,209 --> 00:00:27,334
up the closing a bit.

10
00:00:27,459 --> 00:00:29,417
Every year we try

11
00:00:29,417 --> 00:00:32,209
and be sensitive to your time.

12
00:00:32,209 --> 00:00:35,209
Normally it's it used to be two hours.

13
00:00:35,209 --> 00:00:36,459
How many remember that?

14
00:00:36,459 --> 00:00:37,459
Yeah.

15
00:00:37,459 --> 00:00:39,999
Then it was an hour and a half.

16
00:00:39,999 --> 00:00:41,667
And now we're targeting an hour.

17
00:00:41,667 --> 00:00:42,999
So you can get out of here and get

18
00:00:42,999 --> 00:00:44,999
out a little bit more.

19
00:00:45,626 --> 00:00:47,999
So we're going to try to do it in an hour.

20
00:00:48,542 --> 00:00:52,999
So before we really get started,

21
00:00:52,999 --> 00:00:55,999
How many people noticed this year,

22
00:00:55,999 --> 00:00:59,250
to make things a little bit better

23
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:01,876
One is five more minutes

24
00:01:01,876 --> 00:01:04,709
crushed getting from room to room.

25
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:05,709
Was that good?

26
00:01:05,709 --> 00:01:06,959
(Cheers and Applause).

27
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:07,959
Excellent!

28
00:01:07,959 --> 00:01:08,959
Okay.

29
00:01:11,959 --> 00:01:15,083
So we'll stick with that then,

30
00:01:15,083 --> 00:01:19,209
like 45 minute talk was that much

31
00:01:19,209 --> 00:01:20,209
Excuse me.

32
00:01:20,209 --> 00:01:23,334
We have a tradition

33
00:01:23,876 --> 00:01:29,999
And I believe we have

34
00:01:29,999 --> 00:01:32,250
A Mr. what is it?

35
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:33,999
THE DARK TANGENT: Dark Tangent.

36
00:01:33,999 --> 00:01:34,999
Mr. Tangent.

37
00:01:35,709 --> 00:01:39,209
THE DARK TANGENT: I'm supposed

38
00:01:39,209 --> 00:01:40,501
Yes, you are.

39
00:01:40,501 --> 00:01:41,501
All right.

40
00:01:41,501 --> 00:01:43,584
To Jeff sorry.

41
00:01:43,999 --> 00:01:48,584
Mr. Tangent is going to represent

42
00:01:48,584 --> 00:01:49,709
Thank you for coming.

43
00:01:51,751 --> 00:01:54,501
THE DARK TANGENT: Cheers!

44
00:01:56,834 --> 00:01:58,959
(Cheers and Applause).

45
00:02:01,083 --> 00:02:06,083
So as I was saying I was saying,

46
00:02:06,083 --> 00:02:07,167
Very smooth alcohol.

47
00:02:07,167 --> 00:02:08,167
(Laughter).

48
00:02:08,417 --> 00:02:11,083
The finest that money can buy.

49
00:02:11,375 --> 00:02:13,834
So that was one thing

50
00:02:13,834 --> 00:02:15,626
into the villages.

51
00:02:15,626 --> 00:02:18,125
We almost doubled the sizes

52
00:02:18,125 --> 00:02:20,876
So that was good.

53
00:02:20,999 --> 00:02:23,125
(Cheers and Applause).

54
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:26,999
So you noticed we took away space

55
00:02:26,999 --> 00:02:30,999
gave it to the villages and that whole

56
00:02:30,999 --> 00:02:34,250
into smaller sections,

57
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:37,999
and make new friends and kind

58
00:02:37,999 --> 00:02:41,375
of creative problem solving thing going

59
00:02:41,375 --> 00:02:43,667
We added 20 stations

60
00:02:43,667 --> 00:02:45,999
and they were, like, filled.

61
00:02:46,209 --> 00:02:48,542
Next year we

62
00:02:48,584 --> 00:02:49,834
And it's (Applause).

63
00:02:54,083 --> 00:02:57,626
So you can sort of see where this

64
00:02:57,626 --> 00:02:59,083
We might actually,

65
00:02:59,083 --> 00:03:01,542
to cut a track of speaking

66
00:03:01,542 --> 00:03:04,667
all of these other villages

67
00:03:04,667 --> 00:03:06,334
participate in.

68
00:03:06,375 --> 00:03:09,834
That's really where we are trying

69
00:03:09,834 --> 00:03:13,834
into smaller problem solving groups

70
00:03:13,834 --> 00:03:16,167
will be

71
00:03:16,167 --> 00:03:18,751
to try to just really pick

72
00:03:18,751 --> 00:03:21,209
and that's what's happening.

73
00:03:21,209 --> 00:03:22,999
I'm glad you guys are buying in on it.

74
00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:25,167
So very good.

75
00:03:25,292 --> 00:03:26,584
Yay team!

76
00:03:26,584 --> 00:03:27,584
(Applause).

77
00:03:27,584 --> 00:03:33,999
So we're now going to start

78
00:03:34,417 --> 00:03:37,125
And this is a tradition we have done

79
00:03:37,125 --> 00:03:40,250
We will announce all the winners

80
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:41,834
We have up here

81
00:03:41,834 --> 00:03:44,459
the winners

82
00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:46,876
into DEF CON for life.

83
00:03:46,999 --> 00:03:49,083
It changes year

84
00:03:49,083 --> 00:03:52,667
the contests are, based

85
00:03:52,667 --> 00:03:56,876
technical skill needed and

86
00:03:56,876 --> 00:03:59,334
everybody always plays

87
00:03:59,334 --> 00:04:02,876
and hacker jeopardy always

88
00:04:02,876 --> 00:04:07,999
It's also first year of the new capture

89
00:04:08,292 --> 00:04:10,999
So I think they have done

90
00:04:15,751 --> 00:04:18,999
So we will be finding out who

91
00:04:18,999 --> 00:04:20,792
So I have got my sheet.

92
00:04:20,792 --> 00:04:22,584
I've got my numbers

93
00:04:22,584 --> 00:04:24,125
five minutes.

94
00:04:24,125 --> 00:04:25,125
Wait.

95
00:04:25,125 --> 00:04:26,667
You have two more minutes.

96
00:04:26,667 --> 00:04:29,375
THE DARK TANGENT: I have two

97
00:04:29,375 --> 00:04:30,375
See, look!

98
00:04:30,375 --> 00:04:31,375
Look at that!

99
00:04:31,375 --> 00:04:36,792
You know,

100
00:04:36,792 --> 00:04:41,334
we will be threatened.

101
00:04:41,334 --> 00:04:43,999
We will be confused

102
00:04:43,999 --> 00:04:46,584
So I'm going

103
00:04:46,584 --> 00:04:48,834
chaos monkey

104
00:04:48,834 --> 00:04:51,459
a curve and not go with it.

105
00:04:52,334 --> 00:04:54,584
There's

106
00:04:54,584 --> 00:04:57,167
somebody has found up on stage.

107
00:04:57,876 --> 00:05:00,999
So I want to introduce Lockheed.

108
00:05:00,999 --> 00:05:03,125
Remember last year when Lockheed

109
00:05:07,209 --> 00:05:09,918
(Applause) It's like,

110
00:05:09,918 --> 00:05:12,334
LOCKHEED: Yeah,

111
00:05:12,334 --> 00:05:14,083
THE DARK TANGENT: That's right.

112
00:05:14,083 --> 00:05:15,459
It's a curse and a blessing.

113
00:05:15,459 --> 00:05:19,751
So I would like to introduce Lockheed,

114
00:05:19,751 --> 00:05:24,125
of the items here, and we're going

115
00:05:24,125 --> 00:05:28,626
of our staff that are retiring,

116
00:05:28,999 --> 00:05:30,125
(Laughter).

117
00:05:30,459 --> 00:05:32,918
So we fully expect

118
00:05:32,918 --> 00:05:36,999
and doing something else, but for now,

119
00:05:36,999 --> 00:05:39,999
and transitioning into something else.

120
00:05:39,999 --> 00:05:42,083
So Lockheed, take it away.

121
00:05:44,083 --> 00:05:46,584
LOCKHEED: All right.

122
00:05:48,667 --> 00:05:51,501
(Applause) First question,

123
00:05:51,501 --> 00:05:54,584
they have survived DEF CON now?

124
00:05:55,292 --> 00:05:56,751
(Applause).

125
00:05:57,459 --> 00:06:00,999
I have some bad news for you,

126
00:06:02,459 --> 00:06:03,876
(Laughter).

127
00:06:03,999 --> 00:06:07,999
First of all, I have really got

128
00:06:07,999 --> 00:06:12,083
We have an amazing staff that puts this

129
00:06:12,083 --> 00:06:15,083
We work literally all year

130
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:17,792
So I have got to call

131
00:06:17,792 --> 00:06:21,792

00:07:26,083 --> 00:07:27,459
(Applause).

149
00:07:28,292 --> 00:07:31,250

and having to actually deal with him

158
00:08:04,999 --> 00:08:06,250
(Applause).

159
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:12,709
And how many people saw

160
00:08:12,999 --> 00:08:14,167
(Cheers).

161
00:08:14,542 --> 00:08:15,876
Good?

162
00:08:16,083 --> 00:08:17,083
You liked it?

163
00:08:17,083 --> 00:08:18,083
Yeah?

164
00:08:18,083 --> 00:08:20,459
So we definitely have

165
00:08:20,459 --> 00:08:26,083
for all of their hard work giving

166
00:08:26,083 --> 00:08:28,792
to make this happen.

167
00:08:28,999 --> 00:08:30,125
(Applause).

168
00:08:30,417 --> 00:08:33,709
Now, as Jeff said,

169
00:08:33,709 --> 00:08:36,083
an active fantasy life.

170
00:08:36,999 --> 00:08:39,667
So we would like to take just

171
00:08:39,667 --> 00:08:42,999
the people who believe that

172
00:08:43,083 --> 00:08:44,417
(Laughter).

173
00:08:44,751 --> 00:08:48,209
So we want to start

174
00:08:48,209 --> 00:08:51,999
operations for the last 20 years.

175
00:08:55,167 --> 00:08:56,584
Zac?

176
00:08:59,834 --> 00:09:01,918
(Cheers and Applause).

177
00:09:04,999 --> 00:09:07,876
Thank you, DEF CON!

178
00:09:10,999 --> 00:09:13,083
Thank you

179
00:09:13,083 --> 00:09:14,250
(Cheers and Applause).

180
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:14,250
THE DARK TANGENT: So just

181
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:15,999
is you can't afford to come back,

182
00:09:15,999 --> 00:09:17,751
in for free forever.

183
00:09:18,083 --> 00:09:21,584
(Cheers and Applause).

184
00:09:21,999 --> 00:09:25,959
Now we have done this

185
00:09:25,959 --> 00:09:29,709
and it probably won't make it

186
00:09:29,709 --> 00:09:34,459
but we had this special plaque made

187
00:09:34,459 --> 00:09:36,417
You are first person to ever receive it.

188
00:09:36,417 --> 00:09:38,250
Sort of lifetime achievement award.

189
00:09:38,292 --> 00:09:40,501
Goon emeritus.

190
00:09:55,584 --> 00:09:58,751
(Applause)    Thank you, DEF CON!

191
00:10:13,792 --> 00:10:15,000
(Cheers

192
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,083
TANGENT: So we'll see you again next

193
00:10:18,083 --> 00:10:20,334
Yeah, I will be keeping an eye

194
00:10:20,334 --> 00:10:21,334
Thank you so much.

195
00:10:21,334 --> 00:10:23,751
THE DARK TANGENT: Well,

196
00:10:23,751 --> 00:10:25,792
You need to keep the time too,

197
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:28,999
until the next CON so here's

198
00:10:28,999 --> 00:10:30,584
That's from the security goons.

199
00:10:30,584 --> 00:10:39,417
This is from all the security goons,

200
00:10:47,751 --> 00:10:48,999
Thank you.

201
00:10:48,999 --> 00:10:49,999
(Applause).

202
00:10:49,999 --> 00:10:51,542
LOCKHEED: And, Zac,

203
00:10:51,542 --> 00:10:55,626
and having dinner and knowing how

204
00:10:55,626 --> 00:10:58,918
and you are really good

205
00:10:58,918 --> 00:11:04,292
we wanted to provide you this very nice

206
00:11:04,876 --> 00:11:06,209
(Laughter).

207
00:11:06,792 --> 00:11:09,999
Now, just remember just remember

208
00:11:09,999 --> 00:11:13,999
at the airport, this

209
00:11:13,999 --> 00:11:14,999
(Laughter).

210
00:11:16,083 --> 00:11:17,999
So congratulations.

211
00:11:19,709 --> 00:11:20,999
(Applause).

212
00:11:22,792 --> 00:11:25,125
Thank you, everybody!

213
00:11:26,999 --> 00:11:30,542
And here's to another 20 years

214
00:11:30,542 --> 00:11:32,999
We have seen it change so much

215
00:11:33,375 --> 00:11:35,250
We have grown up as a community,

216
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:37,999
to say we are fucking awesome!

217
00:11:37,999 --> 00:11:38,999
So keep it up!

218
00:11:38,999 --> 00:11:40,125
(Cheers and Applause).

219
00:11:40,125 --> 00:11:49,999
THE DARK TANGENT: You may have

220
00:11:49,999 --> 00:11:59,125
playing, but Roamer has been

221
00:11:59,876 --> 00:12:02,542
One of my good friends and as soon

222
00:12:02,542 --> 00:12:04,501
he moved to California.

223
00:12:04,626 --> 00:12:05,751
(Laughter).

224
00:12:05,876 --> 00:12:07,375
I don't know what's up with that.

225
00:12:07,375 --> 00:12:10,417
ROAMER: You needed somebody

226
00:12:10,999 --> 00:12:12,999
Now he's five minutes from the colo.

227
00:12:13,667 --> 00:12:17,501
He can swap

228
00:12:18,709 --> 00:12:20,999
I don't know how I really want

229
00:12:20,999 --> 00:12:23,626
You found a niche

230
00:12:23,626 --> 00:12:25,999
You have done really well

231
00:12:25,999 --> 00:12:27,999
It feels really bad in losing them.

232
00:12:27,999 --> 00:12:29,709
You have done a great job

233
00:12:29,709 --> 00:12:31,501
and promoting them.

234
00:12:31,501 --> 00:12:34,250
It will be left in good hands, right?

235
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:38,542
It better be because you

236
00:12:38,542 --> 00:12:40,667
ROAMER: Yeah,

237
00:12:40,667 --> 00:12:42,751
work exactly

238
00:12:42,751 --> 00:12:46,542
but    THE DARK TANGENT: So,

239
00:12:46,999 --> 00:12:49,667
Also probably not safe for x ray.

240
00:12:50,125 --> 00:12:54,459
So if so if Zac is goon emeritus,

241
00:12:57,751 --> 00:12:59,834
ROAMER: Goon drunkess.

242
00:12:59,834 --> 00:13:02,459
THE DARK TANGENT: Guitarus

243
00:13:05,125 --> 00:13:08,083
You are the second ever goon emeritus.

244
00:13:10,999 --> 00:13:13,834
Roamer has been with us

245
00:13:14,125 --> 00:13:17,667
I think he's put in his 12 years.

246
00:13:17,667 --> 00:13:18,999
ROAMER: A little bit.

247
00:13:18,999 --> 00:13:21,834
THE DARK TANGENT: So you don't

248
00:13:21,834 --> 00:13:24,876
you have been with us for at least ten.

249
00:13:25,292 --> 00:13:27,999
So you have just made the cut, man.

250
00:13:27,999 --> 00:13:28,999
Thank you very much.

251
00:13:28,999 --> 00:13:30,709
It will be really sad seeing you go.

252
00:13:30,709 --> 00:13:31,709
ROAMER: Thanks.

253
00:13:31,709 --> 00:13:33,999
THE DARK TANGENT: Anything you

254
00:13:33,999 --> 00:13:34,999
(Applause).

255
00:13:34,999 --> 00:13:38,375
ROAMER: The only thing I want

256
00:13:38,375 --> 00:13:43,792
you know, all of these years.

257
00:13:43,792 --> 00:13:45,334
This has been an absolute blast.

258
00:13:45,334 --> 00:13:46,999
I have always done it

259
00:13:46,999 --> 00:13:50,083
done it because I love you guys

260
00:13:50,083 --> 00:13:51,999
is without you.

261
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:54,999
So thank you all for showing

262
00:13:55,292 --> 00:13:58,626
And next year let's

263
00:14:05,999 --> 00:14:08,918
(Applause)    THE DARK TANGENT:

264
00:14:08,918 --> 00:14:11,209
embarrassing picture of Noid.

265
00:14:11,876 --> 00:14:13,083
(Laughter).

266
00:14:13,751 --> 00:14:17,999
And if you look at the if you look

267
00:14:17,999 --> 00:14:20,083
a DEF CON 5 badge.

268
00:14:20,876 --> 00:14:24,999
So Noid is one of a handful

269
00:14:24,999 --> 00:14:27,250
since DEF CON 1.

270
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:31,375
I think there's Connell,

271
00:14:31,375 --> 00:14:36,083
and Jenner Grannick came

272
00:14:38,292 --> 00:14:40,999
Not only did he stick

273
00:14:40,999 --> 00:14:44,417
He put in 21 years at DEF CON.

274
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:48,918
I do this presentation and it has

275
00:14:48,918 --> 00:14:52,292
from DEF CON 1 sticking

276
00:14:52,292 --> 00:14:56,083
of these people and

277
00:14:57,918 --> 00:15:00,501
It's bittersweet to see Noid move on.

278
00:15:00,751 --> 00:15:02,667
I support him.

279
00:15:02,999 --> 00:15:06,626
He's really revolutionized

280
00:15:06,626 --> 00:15:08,375
It went from an ad hoc, hey,

281
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:11,751
and tell me when they are lighting

282
00:15:11,751 --> 00:15:14,125
floating gasoline or something.

283
00:15:14,125 --> 00:15:15,125
(Laughter).

284
00:15:15,125 --> 00:15:17,667
So you seem to put

285
00:15:17,667 --> 00:15:19,626
Would you like to do that full time, sir?

286
00:15:20,501 --> 00:15:24,292
So he's done a fantastic job

287
00:15:24,292 --> 00:15:25,876
from us.

288
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:29,250
He's emeritus number three.

289
00:15:30,083 --> 00:15:34,626
Anyway, it's just it's one

290
00:15:34,626 --> 00:15:36,999
to see you go, man.

291
00:15:36,999 --> 00:15:38,792
You have we'll see if you come back.

292
00:15:38,792 --> 00:15:39,792
(Laughter).

293
00:15:39,792 --> 00:15:40,792
Thank you so much.

294
00:15:40,792 --> 00:15:41,792
(Applause).

295
00:15:41,792 --> 00:15:42,999
(Cheers and Applause).

296
00:15:42,999 --> 00:15:43,999
Give it up!

297
00:15:43,999 --> 00:15:45,083
(Cheers and Applause).

298
00:15:45,083 --> 00:15:47,959
THE DARK TANGENT: Uh oh,

299
00:15:47,959 --> 00:17:11,999
What is going on back there?

300
00:17:11,999 --> 00:17:12,999
(Music).

301
00:17:12,999 --> 00:17:14,083
(Whistling)    Speech!

302
00:17:14,083 --> 00:17:15,083
Speech!

303
00:17:15,083 --> 00:17:17,125
So can I talk into this one?

304
00:17:24,083 --> 00:17:25,250
Damn!

305
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:26,250
(Laughter).

306
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:31,292
Are you going to cry?

307
00:17:31,292 --> 00:17:32,709
No, I'm not going to cry.

308
00:17:32,709 --> 00:17:34,083
First off, thank you, Jeff.

309
00:17:34,083 --> 00:17:35,083
Thank you.

310
00:17:35,083 --> 00:17:37,083
THE DARK TANGENT: You're

311
00:17:37,083 --> 00:17:37,083
And everyone else

312
00:17:37,083 --> 00:17:38,751
a pleasure for the last 21 years.

313
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:41,999
It's amazing that I have been able

314
00:17:41,999 --> 00:17:46,209
of this thing and watch it grow from,

315
00:17:46,209 --> 00:17:50,792
to we have storage rooms larger than

316
00:17:50,999 --> 00:17:52,083
(Laughter).

317
00:17:52,334 --> 00:17:55,751
But what I really want to say

318
00:17:55,751 --> 00:17:58,584
to lead them all of these years.

319
00:17:58,626 --> 00:18:01,250
And I think you all are going

320
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:03,209
will be replacing me.

321
00:18:03,542 --> 00:18:04,751
Give it up for CJ.

322
00:18:10,334 --> 00:18:12,417
(Cheers and Applause).

323
00:18:18,083 --> 00:18:20,709
And, again, thank you

324
00:18:20,709 --> 00:18:24,999
for the last I think we have been

325
00:18:24,999 --> 00:18:27,709
what, DEF CON 5 or DEF CON 2?

326
00:18:27,999 --> 00:18:29,125
Yeah, 2.

327
00:18:29,501 --> 00:18:30,501
Jesus!

328
00:18:31,999 --> 00:18:33,083
Yeah.

329
00:18:33,083 --> 00:18:34,999
Thanks for letting me be a part

330
00:18:34,999 --> 00:18:38,125
a part of it and I'm looking forward

331
00:18:38,999 --> 00:18:42,999
Also, I have two people

332
00:18:42,999 --> 00:18:45,125
They have both put in well

333
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:49,999
they have been a critical part

334
00:18:50,083 --> 00:18:54,417
Luna Slud, get up here, Linda.

335
00:18:54,417 --> 00:18:55,417
(Applause).

336
00:18:55,417 --> 00:19:08,999
So with your ten plus years

337
00:19:08,999 --> 00:19:25,876
you guys both have earned your black

338
00:19:25,876 --> 00:19:42,709
You have earned your black badge!

339
00:19:42,709 --> 00:19:43,959
(Cheers and Applause).

340
00:19:43,959 --> 00:19:46,999
Again, thank you, everyone,

341
00:19:46,999 --> 00:19:49,334
And I'm sure I will probably see you

342
00:19:50,751 --> 00:19:53,083
Don't go anywhere.

343
00:19:55,209 --> 00:19:57,292
(Cheers and Applause).

344
00:19:59,459 --> 00:20:02,042
Yeah, for those

345
00:20:02,042 --> 00:20:04,834
will tell a really quick story.

346
00:20:04,834 --> 00:20:08,417
In the planning for DEF CON 20,

347
00:20:08,417 --> 00:20:13,334
Jeff asked Noid, is there anything

348
00:20:13,709 --> 00:20:14,709
One word ...

349
00:20:14,709 --> 00:20:15,999
battle axes!

350
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:17,042
(Laughter).

351
00:20:17,209 --> 00:20:19,959
So    We're still waiting on them.

352
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:25,042
We give you goon caliber.

353
00:20:25,334 --> 00:20:26,667
(Applause).

354
00:20:26,959 --> 00:20:29,667
And it's sharp!

355
00:20:29,959 --> 00:20:31,042
(Laughter).

356
00:20:31,334 --> 00:20:37,042
I got a fucking battle ax!

357
00:20:37,334 --> 00:20:40,999
Yes, you do.

358
00:20:41,042 --> 00:20:45,459
Someone sweet overheard,

359
00:20:45,459 --> 00:20:46,459
Sweet!

360
00:20:46,459 --> 00:20:48,417
By the way, you signed this yourself.

361
00:20:48,417 --> 00:20:49,417
Yes, yes.

362
00:20:50,959 --> 00:20:53,167
No one told me not to.

363
00:20:53,167 --> 00:20:54,167
(Laughter).

364
00:20:54,167 --> 00:20:56,292
Would you have paid attention

365
00:20:56,292 --> 00:20:57,292
Eh.

366
00:20:57,292 --> 00:20:58,292
That's true.

367
00:20:58,292 --> 00:21:00,876
Thank you.

368
00:21:01,083 --> 00:21:03,083
I'm Sky Dog.

369
00:21:03,083 --> 00:21:04,083
Hi, everyone.

370
00:21:04,083 --> 00:21:05,125
Are we having fun yet?

371
00:21:05,876 --> 00:21:07,083
(Applause).

372
00:21:08,417 --> 00:21:10,959
Watch it now, watch it.

373
00:21:10,959 --> 00:21:12,501
I don't know what to do with it.

374
00:21:12,501 --> 00:21:14,334
Figure it out on your own.

375
00:21:14,375 --> 00:21:20,334
My first DEF CON was 11 years ago.

376
00:21:20,542 --> 00:21:25,083
This is now my ninth year

377
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:28,999
At year three, I earned my goon coin.

378
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:31,918
When I don't have it in my pocket

379
00:21:31,918 --> 00:21:33,334
in the safe.

380
00:21:33,584 --> 00:21:36,417
I treat it

381
00:21:36,626 --> 00:21:38,209
It's a symbol of our brotherhood.

382
00:21:39,792 --> 00:21:44,667
Three years ago,

383
00:21:44,876 --> 00:21:47,792
I got a set of challenge coins made

384
00:21:47,792 --> 00:21:49,542
in our community.

385
00:21:50,167 --> 00:21:54,542
Outside ring

386
00:21:54,999 --> 00:22:00,918
Loyalty, fraternity and honor, sacrifice,

387
00:22:00,999 --> 00:22:04,542
I give these away to the people

388
00:22:04,542 --> 00:22:07,999
qualities, and who have gone

389
00:22:08,083 --> 00:22:10,918
You, sir, are the recipient of number 15.

390
00:22:11,083 --> 00:22:12,125
Please take the coin.

391
00:22:12,125 --> 00:22:13,375
(Cheers and Applause).

392
00:22:20,999 --> 00:22:23,501
Thank you, sir.

393
00:22:32,125 --> 00:22:34,501
You stand relieved, sir.

394
00:22:34,751 --> 00:22:37,083
Can someone take this ax

395
00:22:37,083 --> 00:22:38,083
(Laughter).

396
00:22:39,667 --> 00:22:42,709
Are you really sure you want

397
00:22:42,751 --> 00:22:45,584
Could someone else take the ax?

398
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:47,709
(Laughter).

399
00:22:48,417 --> 00:22:50,667
Noid, the team has already prepared

400
00:22:50,667 --> 00:22:54,667
for you which says that you

401
00:22:54,667 --> 00:23:06,709
Now here's where I get all weepy.

402
00:23:06,709 --> 00:23:07,709
(Applause).

403
00:23:07,709 --> 00:23:07,751
THE DARK TANGENT: You might

404
00:23:07,751 --> 00:23:10,751
if you take the winder it comes

405
00:23:10,751 --> 00:23:11,999
Remember that tonight.

406
00:23:11,999 --> 00:23:12,999
(Laughter).

407
00:23:12,999 --> 00:23:14,250
Good luck, everybody.

408
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:15,918
THE DARK TANGENT: Thank you.

409
00:23:15,918 --> 00:23:16,918
Thanks.

410
00:23:16,918 --> 00:23:17,918
(Applause).

411
00:23:17,918 --> 00:23:18,918
(Music).

412
00:23:18,918 --> 00:23:20,292
This is the goon theme tune.

413
00:24:05,334 --> 00:24:07,834
LOCKHEED: All right.

414
00:24:07,834 --> 00:24:10,501
Well, for first time in a very long time,

415
00:24:10,501 --> 00:24:12,584
the network slides.

416
00:24:13,083 --> 00:24:15,125
You should cheer at that point.

417
00:24:15,501 --> 00:24:16,834
(Cheers).

418
00:24:16,999 --> 00:24:18,542
All right.

419
00:24:18,542 --> 00:24:21,083
So let me introduce Efffn who has taken

420
00:24:21,083 --> 00:24:22,083
Louis.

421
00:24:22,083 --> 00:24:27,999
How is it going, guys?

422
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:30,709
(Cheers).

423
00:24:31,999 --> 00:24:36,083
So let's go real quick oh,

424
00:24:36,083 --> 00:24:37,083
Seven minutes?

425
00:24:37,125 --> 00:24:39,542
That's too long.

426
00:24:39,542 --> 00:24:40,709
So we're going to go

427
00:24:40,709 --> 00:24:43,876
about the network team,

428
00:24:44,083 --> 00:24:47,542
In case you don't know yet, this

429
00:24:47,542 --> 00:24:50,083
We provide the wired infrastructure.

430
00:24:50,083 --> 00:24:54,083
We've spent all week here,

431
00:24:54,083 --> 00:24:59,250
vendors, contests, goons, servers,

432
00:24:59,250 --> 00:25:03,292
from Jeff is connected to the network.

433
00:25:03,542 --> 00:25:06,375
The wireless network,

434
00:25:06,375 --> 00:25:09,417
which we're going to talk about it.

435
00:25:09,417 --> 00:25:10,417
(Laughter).

436
00:25:10,417 --> 00:25:14,542
And the DCTV as well.

437
00:25:14,542 --> 00:25:17,542
So if you are watching from your room,

438
00:25:17,999 --> 00:25:20,584
So what else?

439
00:25:20,584 --> 00:25:21,584
The timeline.

440
00:25:21,584 --> 00:25:25,250
I know most of you know this already,

441
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:28,999
is we get here

442
00:25:28,999 --> 00:25:35,083
and we do setup for three days,

443
00:25:35,375 --> 00:25:37,584
We have a very awesome team.

444
00:25:37,709 --> 00:25:39,876
And then once

445
00:25:39,876 --> 00:25:43,167
the last minute requests show

446
00:25:43,167 --> 00:25:46,542
keep it working and add some stuff

447
00:25:46,542 --> 00:25:48,999
So and tomorrow we leave.

448
00:25:48,999 --> 00:25:50,792
We are packing up and we leave.

449
00:25:50,999 --> 00:25:56,584
But as Steve said, we planned this

450
00:25:56,584 --> 00:26:01,459
from the network side either,

451
00:26:01,459 --> 00:26:06,209
about what's going to happen

452
00:26:06,209 --> 00:26:10,083
we already have some planning stuff,

453
00:26:10,083 --> 00:26:14,626
for things and when stuff gets red

454
00:26:14,626 --> 00:26:20,083
that's when we have lots of calls

455
00:26:20,626 --> 00:26:23,709
The wired infrastructure, number one,

456
00:26:23,709 --> 00:26:26,751
of 120 mega bits per

457
00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:31,083
it's not that much, I have more

458
00:26:33,876 --> 00:26:38,999
At DEF CON 14,

459
00:26:38,999 --> 00:26:41,709
So I think we're doing good.

460
00:26:42,959 --> 00:26:45,125
And what else with you?

461
00:26:45,125 --> 00:26:47,542
We have we use free BSD firewalls.

462
00:26:47,999 --> 00:26:49,250
(Cheers).

463
00:26:49,709 --> 00:26:54,918
TMX switches and a whole punch

464
00:26:55,709 --> 00:26:59,709
For the wireless stuff, we still have

465
00:26:59,709 --> 00:27:03,626
Aruba 6000 switch

466
00:27:03,626 --> 00:27:06,999
Louise, did you burn

467
00:27:06,999 --> 00:27:07,999
No.

468
00:27:07,999 --> 00:27:09,751
We pegged the bandwidth, right?

469
00:27:09,959 --> 00:27:14,999
Yes, we have a slide for that.

470
00:27:15,125 --> 00:27:18,834
Oh, you learned well!

471
00:27:19,083 --> 00:27:22,626
Talking about Internet traffic,

472
00:27:22,626 --> 00:27:26,334
you guys somehow either nobody here

473
00:27:26,334 --> 00:27:29,959
of course you stop using

474
00:27:29,959 --> 00:27:32,751
to the bar and the casinos.

475
00:27:32,751 --> 00:27:33,751
(Laughter).

476
00:27:33,999 --> 00:27:36,542
But during the party you can see, like,

477
00:27:36,542 --> 00:27:38,918
everyone was using that.

478
00:27:38,999 --> 00:27:42,667
Really those dips are where

479
00:27:44,876 --> 00:27:46,999
One way or another.

480
00:27:47,626 --> 00:27:50,999
As for the that was the Internet traffic.

481
00:27:50,999 --> 00:27:53,292
This is and I will go

482
00:27:53,375 --> 00:27:56,959
We will make this available

483
00:28:00,542 --> 00:28:04,083
The interesting thing

484
00:28:04,083 --> 00:28:08,626
on the network and was working well

485
00:28:08,626 --> 00:28:12,167
and we had to apply some quality

486
00:28:12,167 --> 00:28:14,417
the whole network.

487
00:28:14,542 --> 00:28:20,334
As for wireless statistics, this

488
00:28:20,542 --> 00:28:24,626
So we pegged around 600 users.

489
00:28:24,709 --> 00:28:28,626
But we had almost 4,000 unique MAC

490
00:28:28,626 --> 00:28:30,751
We know it doesn't mean anything,

491
00:28:31,709 --> 00:28:32,999
(Laughter).

492
00:28:34,167 --> 00:28:36,999
Some stuff about statistics.

493
00:28:36,999 --> 00:28:39,626
We don't have, like, an historic one

494
00:28:39,626 --> 00:28:41,999
of attacks

495
00:28:41,999 --> 00:28:44,584
about 801 attacks as well.

496
00:28:44,584 --> 00:28:46,999
There's better information there

497
00:28:47,834 --> 00:28:51,876
And on the right hand side,

498
00:28:51,876 --> 00:28:54,999
This is like the realtime coverage

499
00:28:55,083 --> 00:28:56,959
We always have issues.

500
00:28:56,999 --> 00:29:00,834
Some of them are sort of expected,

501
00:29:00,876 --> 00:29:03,501
We enjoyed this as well.

502
00:29:03,501 --> 00:29:09,083
So this year we should make a T shirt,

503
00:29:09,083 --> 00:29:12,999
DEF CON secure as MAC,

504
00:29:12,999 --> 00:29:18,999
next year DEF CON secure should be

505
00:29:19,626 --> 00:29:20,999
(Cheers).

506
00:29:21,459 --> 00:29:23,626
And I would like to thank.

507
00:29:23,626 --> 00:29:24,667
This is the team.

508
00:29:24,876 --> 00:29:26,250
Everybody's name is there.

509
00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:27,999
They do an amazing job.

510
00:29:27,999 --> 00:29:32,334
As I said, we do a lot of planning

511
00:29:32,334 --> 00:29:36,417
we hit the ground here, it's a lot

512
00:29:36,751 --> 00:29:40,250
This is a busy week

513
00:29:40,250 --> 00:29:44,999
they really put their heart and soul

514
00:29:44,999 --> 00:29:50,792
including in the transition phase,

515
00:29:55,709 --> 00:29:58,334
(Applause) And

516
00:29:58,334 --> 00:29:59,959
I don't know where Heather is.

517
00:29:59,959 --> 00:30:01,999
She's trying to retire but she can't.

518
00:30:02,083 --> 00:30:04,626
LOCKHEED: It was really interesting.

519
00:30:04,626 --> 00:30:06,501
Heather was trying to hang

520
00:30:06,501 --> 00:30:09,999
to do work and that OCD just kept

521
00:30:09,999 --> 00:30:12,999
over and grab something

522
00:30:12,999 --> 00:30:15,751
and push her back to her chair.

523
00:30:15,751 --> 00:30:17,417
It happened for the last four days.

524
00:30:17,417 --> 00:30:19,250
Yes, she got kicked

525
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:22,959
a few times and I would

526
00:30:22,959 --> 00:30:25,792
of work that he has put in.

527
00:30:25,999 --> 00:30:28,417
As I said, this is a busy week

528
00:30:28,417 --> 00:30:33,667
as well and once we hit the ground,

529
00:30:33,667 --> 00:30:35,083
So Mac, thank you.

530
00:30:37,876 --> 00:30:39,083
(Applause).

531
00:30:41,876 --> 00:30:48,250
I would like to thank the hotel,

532
00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:50,751
they're amazing.

533
00:30:50,751 --> 00:30:51,959
They help us out a lot.

534
00:30:52,042 --> 00:30:56,417
We have a Twitter account so you can

535
00:30:56,417 --> 00:31:01,083

536
00:31:01,167 --> 00:31:05,250
But this presentation is going to go

537
00:31:05,250 --> 00:31:06,792
You have there the website.

538
00:31:07,459 --> 00:31:09,999
Any feedback,

539
00:31:09,999 --> 00:31:17,999
THE DARK TANGENT: Next year we

540
00:31:17,999 --> 00:31:23,083

541
00:31:23,083 --> 00:31:25,292
So we will get more stuff.

542
00:31:25,292 --> 00:31:26,542
(Cheers and Applause).

543
00:31:26,542 --> 00:31:28,709
THE DARK TANGENT: Thanks, Jeff.

544
00:31:28,709 --> 00:31:31,542
And lastly, I have 55 seconds.

545
00:31:31,542 --> 00:31:33,501
I would like to thank

546
00:31:33,501 --> 00:31:36,999
up in the NOC and said and dropped

547
00:31:36,999 --> 00:31:40,709
for us saying I worked

548
00:31:40,709 --> 00:31:42,999
nobody sees you guys.

549
00:31:42,999 --> 00:31:44,334
Nobody knows everything.

550
00:31:44,334 --> 00:31:46,999
But you make it work and you take no

551
00:31:46,999 --> 00:31:48,999
This guy dropped off some stuff for us.

552
00:31:48,999 --> 00:31:50,459
Thank you, whomever you are!

553
00:31:53,834 --> 00:31:55,083
(Applause).

554
00:31:58,417 --> 00:32:01,083
THE DARK TANGENT: Okay.

555
00:32:01,083 --> 00:32:03,999
Next up, we are going to have Mico,

556
00:32:03,999 --> 00:32:06,334
for the DEF CON kids.

557
00:32:07,125 --> 00:32:08,709
Thank you.

558
00:32:09,292 --> 00:32:13,083
If Chris and win, if you are here,

559
00:32:14,334 --> 00:32:17,999
We had about 300 kids

560
00:32:17,999 --> 00:32:20,667
for Rootz DEF CON kids.

561
00:32:23,501 --> 00:32:24,959
(Applause).

562
00:32:27,792 --> 00:32:31,125
And the kids found

563
00:32:31,125 --> 00:32:36,083
will be responsibly disclosing to a lot

564
00:32:37,876 --> 00:32:39,083
(Applause).

565
00:32:40,918 --> 00:32:42,125
Yeah.

566
00:32:43,959 --> 00:32:47,834
So we had we had six contests this

567
00:32:47,834 --> 00:32:49,167
So kids, a lot of them have gone home,

568
00:32:49,167 --> 00:32:51,083
around and you are a contest winner,

569
00:32:51,083 --> 00:32:53,834
it go ahead and start your way up here.

570
00:32:53,834 --> 00:32:58,834
I'm going to start

571
00:32:58,834 --> 00:33:00,959
Sass crack.

572
00:33:00,959 --> 00:33:01,999
Yeah,

573
00:33:01,999 --> 00:33:04,959
Sass crack for the kids where

574
00:33:04,959 --> 00:33:07,999
into a site that looked a lot

575
00:33:07,999 --> 00:33:11,417
they learned how to break

576
00:33:11,417 --> 00:33:16,751
All six kids but Sneaky McLaughlin

577
00:33:16,751 --> 00:33:19,083
in that group.

578
00:33:19,083 --> 00:33:20,542
If you are around, come on up.

579
00:33:28,292 --> 00:33:32,959
Another contest we had that I think was

580
00:33:32,959 --> 00:33:36,999
in the entire kids world this year was

581
00:33:36,999 --> 00:33:39,792
about the Samsung Smart TV hack

582
00:33:39,792 --> 00:33:44,083
of the researchers taught you how

583
00:33:44,083 --> 00:33:47,542
on 150 million Samsung TVs out there.

584
00:33:47,584 --> 00:33:49,999
Well, they also showed the kids how

585
00:33:49,999 --> 00:33:53,999
out it's really easy to find 0days

586
00:33:53,999 --> 00:33:58,999
So three of the kids found 0days

587
00:33:59,709 --> 00:34:02,999
And they will responsibly disclose

588
00:34:02,999 --> 00:34:04,999
of money for them

589
00:34:04,999 --> 00:34:07,999
and Facebook have bug bounty

590
00:34:08,083 --> 00:34:09,999
We showed the kids how to (Applause).

591
00:34:09,999 --> 00:34:10,999
submit.

592
00:34:10,999 --> 00:34:15,876
And as part of that, they had to pledge,

593
00:34:15,876 --> 00:34:21,834
with this knowledge that they had

594
00:34:21,834 --> 00:34:28,375
of their bounty proceeds to the ACLU

595
00:34:28,375 --> 00:34:30,709
So we also made some money

596
00:34:31,999 --> 00:34:33,209
(Applause).

597
00:34:34,709 --> 00:34:38,209
So Bryce got third place in that contest.

598
00:34:38,209 --> 00:34:39,999
Bryce, if you are here, come on up.

599
00:34:39,999 --> 00:34:43,834
Neil got second place and Sci fi got first

600
00:34:43,834 --> 00:34:50,417
They all found 0days.

601
00:34:50,417 --> 00:34:51,417
(Applause).

602
00:34:51,417 --> 00:34:53,083
Bunny muffins also had a contest.

603
00:34:53,083 --> 00:34:54,584
We had a scavenger hunt this year,

604
00:34:54,584 --> 00:34:56,999
but without the kissing or

605
00:34:56,999 --> 00:34:58,999
like that, obviously.

606
00:34:59,125 --> 00:35:01,751
And the rainbow team won.

607
00:35:01,751 --> 00:35:03,375
So rainbows, come on up.

608
00:35:07,999 --> 00:35:12,292
(Applause) Sci fi had her contest

609
00:35:12,292 --> 00:35:15,999
she teaches all the other kids how

610
00:35:15,999 --> 00:35:19,999
and Cryptina won,

611
00:35:19,999 --> 00:35:29,751
Chris Hadnaggy are you here

612
00:35:32,083 --> 00:35:35,250
Go quick and then win.

613
00:35:35,250 --> 00:35:36,501
I'm going, I'm going.

614
00:35:36,501 --> 00:35:38,834
Hey, little guys, let me jump in front

615
00:35:38,999 --> 00:35:39,999
Okay.

616
00:35:39,999 --> 00:35:43,417
So we have no time, Bella,

617
00:35:43,417 --> 00:35:45,999
They were first place winners,

618
00:35:46,584 --> 00:35:50,167
This year we had a lot of help.

619
00:35:50,167 --> 00:35:51,999
Michele and Amanda and

620
00:35:51,999 --> 00:35:56,250
and we were told it was one

621
00:35:56,250 --> 00:36:00,542
They traversed all different types

622
00:36:00,542 --> 00:36:06,209
people shooting nerfs at their head

623
00:36:06,999 --> 00:36:08,792
Great job, guys.

624
00:36:08,792 --> 00:36:09,792
Great job.

625
00:36:14,999 --> 00:36:16,292
(Applause).

626
00:36:22,083 --> 00:36:24,083
Those are by the way,

627
00:36:24,083 --> 00:36:26,834
with hidden cameras in them.

628
00:36:26,834 --> 00:36:29,876
Which by the way,

629
00:36:30,083 --> 00:36:31,542
(Applause).

630
00:36:31,999 --> 00:36:34,999
Okay, guys.

631
00:36:35,375 --> 00:36:41,999
We are going off stage, either way.

632
00:36:42,292 --> 00:36:47,999
AUDIENCE MEMBER: You guys

633
00:36:48,417 --> 00:36:52,375
They rock, hmm?

634
00:36:52,834 --> 00:36:55,999
(Cheers and Applause).

635
00:36:56,209 --> 00:36:57,626
Mass confusion.

636
00:37:02,125 --> 00:37:05,999
This was first year

637
00:37:05,999 --> 00:37:06,999
This was awesome.

638
00:37:06,999 --> 00:37:09,083
I want to thank Jeff and Nico

639
00:37:09,083 --> 00:37:12,459
to fucking curse at any

640
00:37:18,083 --> 00:37:21,999
As a result, I certainly do owe EFF

641
00:37:21,999 --> 00:37:25,334
for each fucking word I oh, never mind.

642
00:37:25,334 --> 00:37:26,918
I had two great teams 7

643
00:37:26,918 --> 00:37:31,167
they are better than any adult hacker

644
00:37:31,999 --> 00:37:33,417
(Applause).

645
00:37:34,209 --> 00:37:37,209
So we have already been talking

646
00:37:37,209 --> 00:37:38,999
a DEF CON kid.

647
00:37:38,999 --> 00:37:42,083
My Little Ponies won 7 12.

648
00:37:42,083 --> 00:37:43,834
They got the rewards and prizes.

649
00:37:43,834 --> 00:37:44,999
If you are here, stand up.

650
00:37:44,999 --> 00:37:46,292
We don't have a lot of time.

651
00:37:46,292 --> 00:37:47,834
13 to 17 year olds

652
00:37:47,834 --> 00:37:51,542
awesome and one word of advise

653
00:37:51,542 --> 00:37:54,292
haters about what we are doing

654
00:37:54,292 --> 00:37:56,999
have them go fuck themselves.

655
00:37:56,999 --> 00:37:57,999
Bring them on.

656
00:37:57,999 --> 00:37:58,999
Bring the kids here!

657
00:37:58,999 --> 00:37:59,999
It is awesome!

658
00:37:59,999 --> 00:38:01,501
They are the next generation.

659
00:38:01,501 --> 00:38:02,501
Thank you!

660
00:38:04,834 --> 00:38:06,918
(Cheers and Applause).

661
00:38:09,999 --> 00:38:13,375
THE DARK TANGENT: My Little

662
00:38:13,626 --> 00:38:14,834
(Laughter).

663
00:38:14,999 --> 00:38:17,918
I keep thinking of the pony awards.

664
00:38:19,209 --> 00:38:20,667
Okay.

665
00:38:20,667 --> 00:38:22,959
We're going to talk

666
00:38:22,959 --> 00:38:23,459
We had a lot

667
00:38:23,459 --> 00:38:27,083
at DEF CON and for various number

668
00:38:27,083 --> 00:38:31,584
to talk about the let's go

669
00:38:31,584 --> 00:38:33,459
So Mel, do you want to talk about that?

670
00:38:33,751 --> 00:38:37,918
Or have you disappeared Mr. Mel?

671
00:38:37,918 --> 00:38:38,918
Stealth.

672
00:38:38,918 --> 00:38:41,083
THE DARK TANGENT: What have

673
00:38:41,083 --> 00:38:42,083
He's here.

674
00:38:42,083 --> 00:38:43,250
He's way over there.

675
00:38:43,250 --> 00:38:44,667
THE DARK TANGENT: Okay.

676
00:38:44,667 --> 00:38:44,667
Mel used

677
00:38:44,667 --> 00:38:46,083
over the remember

678
00:38:46,083 --> 00:38:48,584
and then we would hack

679
00:38:48,584 --> 00:38:50,999
and other goons' faces in there.

680
00:38:51,834 --> 00:38:54,167
And then before that the dunk tank.

681
00:38:54,167 --> 00:38:55,334
And they are like, well,

682
00:38:55,334 --> 00:38:57,083
of getting a little old.

683
00:38:57,083 --> 00:38:58,083
What should we do?

684
00:38:58,125 --> 00:38:59,876
Well, we could do the dunk tank.

685
00:38:59,876 --> 00:39:01,083
And Mel is like, fuck no!

686
00:39:01,250 --> 00:39:04,584
I'm not standing

687
00:39:04,999 --> 00:39:06,999
So instead he's kind of taken

688
00:39:06,999 --> 00:39:09,626
and so when one thing ends

689
00:39:09,626 --> 00:39:12,792
and I want to hand it off to Mel

690
00:39:12,792 --> 00:39:15,209
fund raising activities that we have had

691
00:39:15,209 --> 00:39:18,542
about the numbers that we have

692
00:39:18,542 --> 00:39:19,542
So Mel?

693
00:39:21,375 --> 00:39:22,792
(Applause).

694
00:39:25,083 --> 00:39:26,876
Okay.

695
00:39:29,083 --> 00:39:30,999
So we are going to okay.

696
00:39:34,083 --> 00:39:35,250
Hey!

00:39:35,751 --> 00:39:38,751
DEF CON!

698
00:39:38,751 --> 00:39:39,751
(Laughter).

699
00:39:39,751 --> 00:39:40,751
Okay.

700
00:39:40,751 --> 00:39:42,459
So, wow, its been really busy this time,

701
00:39:42,459 --> 00:39:45,209
on that I want to tell you

702
00:39:45,209 --> 00:39:47,751
and I will try to run through it.

703
00:39:47,751 --> 00:39:48,751
Okay.

704
00:39:49,083 --> 00:39:52,626
There were a lot there were ten different

705
00:39:52,626 --> 00:39:55,167
to the EFF, the summit, hack a jar

706
00:39:55,167 --> 00:39:57,709
up here and talk about that.

707
00:39:57,709 --> 00:39:59,083
They are doing an awesome job.

708
00:39:59,334 --> 00:40:01,209
I won't give their number.

709
00:40:01,209 --> 00:40:02,834
I promised I wouldn't do that.

710
00:40:02,834 --> 00:40:05,626
But there are other, the Mohawks.

711
00:40:05,626 --> 00:40:07,125
Any of you got Mohawks this time?

712
00:40:14,375 --> 00:40:15,959
Let's see.

713
00:40:15,959 --> 00:40:18,918
Stand 'em up.

714
00:40:25,999 --> 00:40:29,083
Stand 'em up!

715
00:40:29,083 --> 00:40:30,375
All right.

716
00:40:30,375 --> 00:40:31,375
All right.

717
00:40:31,375 --> 00:40:33,709
Well, the Mohawks

718
00:40:33,709 --> 00:40:34,999
(Cheers and Applause).

719
00:40:34,999 --> 00:40:36,375
How about that for craziness.

720
00:40:36,375 --> 00:40:37,375
Okay.

721
00:40:37,375 --> 00:40:38,375
Yeah, go Mohawk!

722
00:40:38,375 --> 00:40:38,375
And our fantastically bizarre

723
00:40:38,375 --> 00:40:40,999
he has raised $3,000

724
00:40:41,083 --> 00:40:42,083
Yeah!

725
00:40:43,999 --> 00:40:45,792
Boy, that's something.

726
00:40:45,792 --> 00:40:46,792
(Applause).

727
00:40:46,792 --> 00:40:51,999
And not to be undone, we also have

728
00:40:51,999 --> 00:40:57,250
flapjacks for freedom,

729
00:41:02,792 --> 00:41:05,083
I'm just making it up.

730
00:41:05,083 --> 00:41:10,209
Then we have cycle overdrive, it's

731
00:41:11,751 --> 00:41:15,584
Pedaling it from coast to coast,

732
00:41:15,626 --> 00:41:18,375
Info booth, did any of you go

733
00:41:18,375 --> 00:41:21,834
for what's going on, where

734
00:41:22,083 --> 00:41:25,083
Even some of the people

735
00:41:25,083 --> 00:41:28,542
They got $642 in donations

736
00:41:28,834 --> 00:41:29,999
Unbelievable!

737
00:41:30,250 --> 00:41:31,584
(Applause).

738
00:41:31,918 --> 00:41:32,918
Unbelievable!

739
00:41:32,918 --> 00:41:33,959
And the list goes on!

740
00:41:33,959 --> 00:41:38,876
Wi Fi Village, Wi Fi Village is there

741
00:41:38,876 --> 00:41:39,876
Okay.

742
00:41:39,876 --> 00:41:40,876
Open Wi Fi.

743
00:41:40,876 --> 00:41:41,876
You rule!

744
00:41:41,999 --> 00:41:45,999
And we've got in the Hardware Village,

745
00:41:45,999 --> 00:41:49,250
to solder

746
00:41:49,250 --> 00:41:52,083
They raised $600 for the EFF.

747
00:41:52,999 --> 00:41:54,375
(Applause).

748
00:41:55,250 --> 00:41:57,375
And not to be forgotten,

749
00:41:57,375 --> 00:41:59,584
of you see hacker jeopardy?

750
00:41:59,626 --> 00:42:00,667
Yeah?

751
00:42:00,751 --> 00:42:02,959
Yeah, that's my boys.

752
00:42:02,959 --> 00:42:04,584
My buddy team, they won that.

753
00:42:04,584 --> 00:42:06,834
Props out, major props out to them.

754
00:42:06,999 --> 00:42:08,792
SoCal views.

755
00:42:10,999 --> 00:42:14,959
They raised $118 to kick in as well.

756
00:42:18,999 --> 00:42:20,459
(Applause).

757
00:42:20,459 --> 00:42:21,999
Now, I'm going to hold

758
00:42:21,999 --> 00:42:24,626
because there's a couple

759
00:42:24,626 --> 00:42:26,918
a little bit about the EFF.

760
00:42:27,709 --> 00:42:30,083
For those of you who don't know,

761
00:42:30,083 --> 00:42:33,959
is the Electronic Freedom Foundation,

762
00:42:33,959 --> 00:42:36,834
And as long as DC won    Drink!

763
00:42:36,834 --> 00:42:39,999
Did I fuck it up?

764
00:42:41,375 --> 00:42:45,999
Hey, audience,

765
00:42:48,584 --> 00:42:50,876
Electronic    Foundation, correct.

766
00:42:50,876 --> 00:42:51,542
I always mess it

767
00:42:51,542 --> 00:42:53,417
of freedom thing on it.

768
00:42:53,417 --> 00:42:54,417
I'll drink.

769
00:42:54,417 --> 00:42:56,999
They are responsible

770
00:42:57,292 --> 00:42:58,999
I love the EFF.

771
00:43:02,584 --> 00:43:04,083
Okay.

772
00:43:04,083 --> 00:43:05,083
Great.

773
00:43:05,083 --> 00:43:06,083
Where were we?

774
00:43:06,083 --> 00:43:06,834
Anyway, as long

775
00:43:06,834 --> 00:43:12,083
plus one year, so my plus one buddies,

776
00:43:12,083 --> 00:43:16,999
to protect your digital rights

777
00:43:16,999 --> 00:43:21,999
is very concerned

778
00:43:21,999 --> 00:43:22,999
(Cheers).

779
00:43:22,999 --> 00:43:23,999
All right.

780
00:43:23,999 --> 00:43:25,999
For many years, we have talked

781
00:43:25,999 --> 00:43:25,999
We have had talks on it,

782
00:43:25,999 --> 00:43:26,999
about it.

783
00:43:26,999 --> 00:43:29,626
You know, it's been

784
00:43:29,626 --> 00:43:31,209
And the basic focus here

785
00:43:31,209 --> 00:43:33,999
to be some more controls

786
00:43:33,999 --> 00:43:35,918
of this stuff.

787
00:43:35,999 --> 00:43:39,501
Now, many of you know

788
00:43:39,501 --> 00:43:42,542
discussion

789
00:43:42,542 --> 00:43:44,999
who will remain nameless.

790
00:43:44,999 --> 00:43:46,250
You can guess on your own.

791
00:43:46,709 --> 00:43:51,083
Anyways, as a result, corporation

792
00:43:51,083 --> 00:43:53,999
realizing that

793
00:43:53,999 --> 00:43:57,125
the impact of this

794
00:43:57,125 --> 00:44:00,792
of Rights and amendments may be

795
00:44:01,626 --> 00:44:04,959
The EFF is fighting a good fight

796
00:44:05,999 --> 00:44:09,999
And there are many powerful interests

797
00:44:09,999 --> 00:44:13,167
As a result,

798
00:44:15,083 --> 00:44:20,167
I'm asking all of you to go to EFF.org,

799
00:44:20,167 --> 00:44:21,999
Look and see what they are doing.

800
00:44:22,125 --> 00:44:23,375
Be part of it.

801
00:44:23,375 --> 00:44:24,999
Be making a difference.

802
00:44:24,999 --> 00:44:26,501
Be part of the solution.

803
00:44:26,999 --> 00:44:28,709
And that's my message to you.

804
00:44:28,709 --> 00:44:31,584
With that, I think I would

805
00:44:31,584 --> 00:44:33,209
to come up.

806
00:44:34,167 --> 00:44:35,999
And Hack a Jar.

807
00:44:35,999 --> 00:44:36,999
Are you there?

808
00:44:40,959 --> 00:44:42,626
All right.

809
00:44:46,542 --> 00:44:47,999
(Applause).

810
00:44:51,959 --> 00:44:53,626
All right.

811
00:44:53,626 --> 00:44:55,999
I guess the EFF has elected for me

812
00:44:56,459 --> 00:44:58,375
My name is Hack a Jar.

813
00:44:58,375 --> 00:44:59,501
I'm part of Vegas 2.0.

814
00:45:00,709 --> 00:45:02,834
We run our fund raiser

815
00:45:02,834 --> 00:45:05,876
for the electronic frontier foundation.

816
00:45:06,250 --> 00:45:10,083
We convince all the speakers

817
00:45:10,083 --> 00:45:13,667
conferences going on in town

818
00:45:13,667 --> 00:45:17,792
in to a private event, that you have

819
00:45:17,792 --> 00:45:21,999
through to and then you get direct

820
00:45:21,999 --> 00:45:25,417
to all the speakers

821
00:45:25,417 --> 00:45:29,751
to them and get more information

822
00:45:29,751 --> 00:45:32,417
that was great, and move on.

823
00:45:32,834 --> 00:45:35,918
I have this thing that is very similar.

824
00:45:36,083 --> 00:45:37,209
We have a lot

825
00:45:37,209 --> 00:45:39,250
with this format,

826
00:45:39,250 --> 00:45:41,083
testimonials and now

827
00:45:41,083 --> 00:45:43,999
with other people as a result of that

828
00:45:43,999 --> 00:45:47,626
all of these different interesting things

829
00:45:47,999 --> 00:45:49,999
We also have a bunch

830
00:45:49,999 --> 00:45:52,999
and we give away so much stuff there.

831
00:45:53,334 --> 00:45:55,999
As a result, everybody wants

832
00:45:55,999 --> 00:45:59,083
and I don't know if I cue somebody

833
00:45:59,083 --> 00:46:01,999
the actual numbers that we raised.

834
00:46:02,334 --> 00:46:03,334
You ready?

835
00:46:03,334 --> 00:46:07,417
Yeah, so this year at the EFF summit,

836
00:46:07,417 --> 00:46:11,876
by three times and our ultimate record

837
00:46:11,999 --> 00:46:14,417
So this year,

838
00:46:14,417 --> 00:46:16,999
have had something to do with this.

839
00:46:16,999 --> 00:46:18,999
Here's how much we actually raised.

840
00:46:25,417 --> 00:46:27,542
(Cheers and Applause).

841
00:46:33,999 --> 00:46:36,918
Not too shabby for four hours worth

842
00:46:40,083 --> 00:46:41,375
(chuckles).

843
00:46:41,375 --> 00:46:43,667
On the back end, we logged

844
00:46:43,667 --> 00:46:47,999
about of actually planning

845
00:46:48,501 --> 00:46:49,999
I want to congratulate

846
00:46:49,999 --> 00:46:53,083
out and made this number possible

847
00:46:53,083 --> 00:46:55,959
And also if we can hit the button again,

848
00:46:55,959 --> 00:46:59,999
out to all of our vendors that paid

849
00:46:59,999 --> 00:47:03,999
It was a $15,000 bar tab

850
00:47:04,584 --> 00:47:07,501
Thank you Google DFS,

851
00:47:07,501 --> 00:47:09,292
and (Applause).

852
00:47:11,999 --> 00:47:14,999
to CrowdTilt,

853
00:47:14,999 --> 00:47:18,626
to get this going and thank you

854
00:47:18,626 --> 00:47:23,709
the little power packs for you

855
00:47:25,542 --> 00:47:28,417
They are

856
00:47:28,417 --> 00:47:32,292
So thank you all very much and I

857
00:47:32,876 --> 00:47:35,125
Thank you.

858
00:47:35,709 --> 00:47:37,083
(Applause).

859
00:47:37,626 --> 00:47:39,751
Before I turn it back over to Kurt

860
00:47:39,751 --> 00:47:41,999
to give some final totals here.

861
00:47:41,999 --> 00:47:45,834
So at Hack a Jar, keep that up.

862
00:47:45,999 --> 00:47:46,999
You rock!

863
00:47:46,999 --> 00:47:47,999
You rock!

864
00:47:48,918 --> 00:47:52,459
With the $35,000 plus

865
00:47:52,459 --> 00:47:56,959
the contributions

866
00:47:56,959 --> 00:47:59,876
to a total of $48,175!

867
00:48:00,083 --> 00:48:03,083
(Cheers and Applause).

868
00:48:03,375 --> 00:48:07,999
But wait, but wait, wait.

869
00:48:08,334 --> 00:48:09,792
That's not all!

870
00:48:09,834 --> 00:48:10,834
We have more.

871
00:48:10,834 --> 00:48:11,959
There's more.

872
00:48:11,959 --> 00:48:12,999
Yes, there's more.

873
00:48:12,999 --> 00:48:13,999
It's Ginsu.

874
00:48:13,999 --> 00:48:15,375
It slices and dices and chop.

875
00:48:15,375 --> 00:48:18,709
At the EFF table itself,

876
00:48:18,709 --> 00:48:22,209
they are still counting the money

877
00:48:22,209 --> 00:48:25,459
they have given me so far was

878
00:48:25,459 --> 00:48:28,751
together that's about $93,000.

879
00:48:28,751 --> 00:48:30,999
I think when they are done,

880
00:48:30,999 --> 00:48:34,083
to $100,000 raised this year for the EFF.

881
00:48:34,334 --> 00:48:36,999
Thank you, all of you

882
00:48:36,999 --> 00:48:38,792
out for this!

883
00:48:39,083 --> 00:48:42,083
(Cheers and Applause).

884
00:48:42,417 --> 00:48:45,459
Thank you.

885
00:48:45,876 --> 00:48:47,375
Thank you so much.

886
00:48:47,417 --> 00:48:49,083
You guys are amazing.

887
00:48:49,083 --> 00:48:53,501
It is such an honor tore here,

888
00:48:53,626 --> 00:48:55,834
Your support helps us fight

889
00:48:55,834 --> 00:48:58,459
for your rights to free speech,

890
00:48:58,459 --> 00:49:00,167
all of the things.

891
00:49:00,167 --> 00:49:18,209
We are so honored to be able

892
00:49:18,209 --> 00:49:22,999

893
00:49:22,999 --> 00:49:23,999
So thank you.

894
00:49:23,999 --> 00:49:24,999
Great, man.

895
00:49:24,999 --> 00:49:25,999
Awesome year.

896
00:49:25,999 --> 00:49:28,792
PYR0: Actually,

897
00:49:28,792 --> 00:49:30,999
I would like to bring

898
00:49:30,999 --> 00:49:34,667
This is the girl this is my lovely wife

899
00:49:34,667 --> 00:49:37,083
They raised money

900
00:49:37,083 --> 00:49:37,083
I wanted to give her a chance

901
00:49:37,083 --> 00:49:38,999
for some of these other organizations.

902
00:49:38,999 --> 00:49:40,834
Hello, I'm Ed.

903
00:49:43,083 --> 00:49:49,250
In addition to the EFF, which

904
00:49:49,417 --> 00:49:54,626
Part of the contributing factor

905
00:49:54,626 --> 00:49:57,417
and Funballs Mohawks.

906
00:49:57,417 --> 00:50:02,209
For those mohawks,

907
00:50:02,209 --> 00:50:05,999
for those two Mohawks.

908
00:50:08,209 --> 00:50:09,667
(Applause).

909
00:50:11,999 --> 00:50:14,292
There's Renderman right there.

910
00:50:16,667 --> 00:50:18,999
I also had    PYR0: You look good

911
00:50:18,999 --> 00:50:21,584
I had one guy walk up to me

912
00:50:21,584 --> 00:50:26,292
no idea existed and he raised $1,000

913
00:50:27,792 --> 00:50:29,000
(Applause).

914
00:50:30,501 --> 00:50:35,250
And then there's another lovely woman

915
00:50:35,459 --> 00:50:37,959
In addition

916
00:50:37,959 --> 00:50:39,584
for Charity.

917
00:50:39,792 --> 00:50:45,042
This year, we raised $2,288

918
00:50:45,542 --> 00:50:52,459
So I want to quickly thank you

919
00:50:52,459 --> 00:50:55,876
Call out to my Mohawk Con cutting

920
00:50:55,876 --> 00:50:59,959
all of your lovely heads

921
00:50:59,959 --> 00:51:01,999
was $7,346.58.

922
00:51:01,999 --> 00:51:03,167
(Cheers and Applause).

923
00:51:03,167 --> 00:51:04,167
Thank you.

924
00:51:04,167 --> 00:51:05,167
PYR0: All right.

925
00:51:05,167 --> 00:51:09,083
Next up we are going to talk

926
00:51:09,083 --> 00:51:17,459
of the other fund raisers that we have

927
00:51:17,834 --> 00:51:19,999
These are very near and dear to most

928
00:51:19,999 --> 00:51:22,999
because we have people

929
00:51:22,999 --> 00:51:26,999
affected and who benefit

930
00:51:26,999 --> 00:51:29,083
So I would like to call

931
00:51:29,083 --> 00:51:31,999
if you could come

932
00:51:34,918 --> 00:51:36,083
(Applause).

933
00:51:38,999 --> 00:51:40,999
Do we see them?

934
00:51:40,999 --> 00:51:43,792
Are they here?

935
00:51:43,792 --> 00:51:45,250
Oh, they to take off yesterday.

936
00:51:45,250 --> 00:51:49,667
So the big thing about be the match

937
00:51:49,999 --> 00:51:51,999
A lot of people get freaked

938
00:51:51,999 --> 00:51:54,709
about bone marrow registration

939
00:51:54,709 --> 00:51:59,083
crazy things about how painful it is,

940
00:51:59,375 --> 00:52:01,334
It's beneficial.

941
00:52:01,334 --> 00:52:04,083
I don't have the numbers for you,

942
00:52:04,083 --> 00:52:06,584
up for this and contributed.

943
00:52:08,125 --> 00:52:10,709
They did have a match last year

944
00:52:10,709 --> 00:52:13,209
a DEF CON attendee who was able

945
00:52:13,209 --> 00:52:15,751
they were able to save their life.

946
00:52:15,751 --> 00:52:16,999
(Cheers and Applause).

947
00:52:20,792 --> 00:52:24,083
Blood Kode do we have

948
00:52:25,125 --> 00:52:26,584
Excellent?

949
00:52:26,584 --> 00:52:27,999
Jason is coming up right now.

950
00:52:31,083 --> 00:52:33,626
How is it going, guys?

951
00:52:33,751 --> 00:52:34,999
(Cheers).

952
00:52:35,167 --> 00:52:38,250
We totally did something different this

953
00:52:38,250 --> 00:52:40,876
but I think it was really important.

954
00:52:40,999 --> 00:52:42,375
There were no gimmicks.

955
00:52:42,417 --> 00:52:44,709
There were no contests.

956
00:52:44,709 --> 00:52:46,334
There were no I'm going

957
00:52:46,334 --> 00:52:48,918
if you donate blood,

958
00:52:48,918 --> 00:52:52,083
of the best blood drives they have had.

959
00:52:52,250 --> 00:52:55,999
It's like so we don't need incentives

960
00:52:55,999 --> 00:53:01,999
The numbers were for Thursday,

961
00:53:02,083 --> 00:53:05,999
Friday, 44 donors, 58 donations.

962
00:53:06,125 --> 00:53:10,709
Saturday 45 donors and 65 donations.

963
00:53:10,792 --> 00:53:14,292
Also she wanted to say, Julie,

964
00:53:14,292 --> 00:53:17,417
the people would came

965
00:53:17,417 --> 00:53:20,999
most generous people I have met

966
00:53:20,999 --> 00:53:23,667
With or without, gifts,

967
00:53:23,667 --> 00:53:26,834
in the right place and that speaks

968
00:53:26,834 --> 00:53:30,334
in the community but can see what

969
00:53:30,334 --> 00:53:32,999
So, guys once again,

970
00:53:32,999 --> 00:53:34,626
Y'all made this wonderful

971
00:53:34,626 --> 00:53:37,501
is such a great community

972
00:53:37,501 --> 00:53:38,584
Thank you once again.

973
00:53:40,292 --> 00:53:41,751
(Applause).

974
00:53:43,792 --> 00:53:47,250
So I would just

975
00:53:47,626 --> 00:53:49,959
So being here for so long,

976
00:53:49,959 --> 00:53:53,375
I watched this community grow

977
00:53:54,334 --> 00:53:57,209
Last year, they had

978
00:53:57,209 --> 00:54:01,751
from Blood Kode, it had

979
00:54:01,999 --> 00:54:05,876
She was literally welling

980
00:54:05,876 --> 00:54:09,125
you guys absolutely kick ass.

981
00:54:09,751 --> 00:54:13,999
You totally beat

982
00:54:13,999 --> 00:54:14,999
(Laughter).

983
00:54:14,999 --> 00:54:17,334
And I think that's awesome.

984
00:54:17,459 --> 00:54:18,584
(Applause).

985
00:54:18,709 --> 00:54:25,501
So I would like to say, going forward,

986
00:54:25,501 --> 00:54:29,876
and I would

987
00:54:29,876 --> 00:54:32,792
of blood to DEF CON.

988
00:54:32,792 --> 00:54:35,584
AUDIENCE MEMBER: All

989
00:54:35,584 --> 00:54:38,709
I'm sure we could try

990
00:54:38,709 --> 00:54:44,250
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Everyone

991
00:54:44,250 --> 00:54:46,083
This is a classic example

992
00:54:46,083 --> 00:54:49,792
the world what our community can do.

993
00:54:50,083 --> 00:54:52,334
So stick it to them.

994
00:54:52,334 --> 00:54:53,667
Give them a pint of blood.

995
00:55:01,999 --> 00:55:03,501
(Cheers and Applause).

996
00:55:03,501 --> 00:55:05,999
THE DARK TANGENT: For those

997
00:55:05,999 --> 00:55:09,334
to drink, I want to just take

998
00:55:09,334 --> 00:55:13,167
a little presentation but I would just

999
00:55:13,167 --> 00:55:16,999
we lost two really key people

1000
00:55:16,999 --> 00:55:22,667
A lot of you know or knew

1001
00:55:22,918 --> 00:55:26,999
Brad was an amazing guy.

1002
00:55:26,999 --> 00:55:28,999
This guy always ran at full speed.

1003
00:55:29,209 --> 00:55:30,999
His brain was over clocked.

1004
00:55:30,999 --> 00:55:33,209
I think that's something that did him in.

1005
00:55:33,209 --> 00:55:35,626
He was thinking and talking twice

1006
00:55:36,584 --> 00:55:39,626
We want to call out and say while

1007
00:55:39,626 --> 00:55:44,876
they will never be forgotten,

1008
00:55:44,876 --> 00:55:45,876
Oh!

1009
00:55:45,876 --> 00:55:48,125
A quick moment here to just reflect

1010
00:55:48,125 --> 00:55:50,999
of the community and what you can do

1011
00:55:50,999 --> 00:55:54,459
to something bigger than yourself,

1012
00:55:54,459 --> 00:55:57,083
they had a great time doing it.

1013
00:55:57,083 --> 00:55:58,083
It wasn't painful.

1014
00:55:58,083 --> 00:56:00,375
It was actually really enjoyable

1015
00:56:00,375 --> 00:56:02,083
So let's just let's give them

1016
00:56:02,083 --> 00:56:04,501
a drink tonight at the bar.

1017
00:56:21,999 --> 00:56:23,209
(Applause).

1018
00:56:40,709 --> 00:56:44,626
Yeah, so it's pretty amazing when you

1019
00:56:44,626 --> 00:56:48,999
will live on, the things

1020
00:56:49,083 --> 00:56:52,626
I know when I get hit by my bus,

1021
00:56:52,626 --> 00:56:55,375
for me and

1022
00:56:55,375 --> 00:56:57,876
is an amazing community.

1023
00:56:57,876 --> 00:57:01,167
Okay I won't keep harping on that

1024
00:57:01,501 --> 00:57:04,083
So let's kick off the contest winners.

1025
00:57:04,083 --> 00:57:07,083
I want to hand that

1026
00:57:10,375 --> 00:57:12,876
PYR0: We will go

1027
00:57:12,876 --> 00:57:16,334
but in the interest

1028
00:57:17,876 --> 00:57:21,125
Most people don't know this Faulker,

1029
00:57:21,125 --> 00:57:22,999
his his birthday.

1030
00:57:24,709 --> 00:57:27,792
Would you please join me

1031
00:57:27,792 --> 00:57:28,792
(Singing).

1032
00:57:28,792 --> 00:57:29,959
Happy birthday to you.

1033
00:57:29,959 --> 00:57:30,999
Happy birthday to you.

1034
00:57:30,999 --> 00:57:32,584
Happy birthday dear, Faulker.

1035
00:57:32,584 --> 00:57:33,751
Happy birthday to you!

1036
00:57:33,999 --> 00:57:35,999
(end of singing) (Applause).

1037
00:57:39,959 --> 00:57:42,999
PYR0: And many more, sir.

1038
00:57:46,999 --> 00:57:48,792
All right.

1039
00:57:52,751 --> 00:57:55,375
We will run through these really quick.

1040
00:57:55,375 --> 00:57:56,542
For those of you who don't know,

1041
00:57:56,542 --> 00:57:59,167
the way that we do contests

1042
00:57:59,167 --> 00:58:01,999
I would like to take a second to thank

1043
00:58:01,999 --> 00:58:05,626
an idea of how large this department

1044
00:58:05,626 --> 00:58:07,834
I first started gooning in DEF CON 7.

1045
00:58:07,834 --> 00:58:09,834
There wasn't really a formal contest

1046
00:58:09,834 --> 00:58:12,999
but there were people doing contests

1047
00:58:12,999 --> 00:58:16,083
They were out in hallways

1048
00:58:16,083 --> 00:58:17,584
It was absolutely insane.

1049
00:58:17,999 --> 00:58:21,834
Here at DEF CON 21, I tried to retire

1050
00:58:21,834 --> 00:58:24,542
of that and I moved

1051
00:58:24,542 --> 00:58:27,626
and I'm overseeing two lead teams.

1052
00:58:29,751 --> 00:58:33,083
We have 242 employees

1053
00:58:33,083 --> 00:58:36,876
the contest lead or their supporters.

1054
00:58:37,834 --> 00:58:40,999
Please give a round of applause

1055
00:58:40,999 --> 00:58:42,999
all of those to you.

1056
00:58:42,999 --> 00:58:43,999
242.

1057
00:58:45,542 --> 00:58:48,501
22 of those are just contest

1058
00:58:48,501 --> 00:58:51,542
an idea of how crazy it is to try

1059
00:58:51,542 --> 00:58:54,125
it's 52 internal divisions that includes

1060
00:58:54,125 --> 00:58:57,209
all the individual contests

1061
00:58:57,209 --> 00:58:58,834
see there.

1062
00:58:58,834 --> 00:59:00,959
It's about one third

1063
00:59:00,959 --> 00:59:04,292
So I really want to give a big props

1064
00:59:04,292 --> 00:59:07,918
You were exceptional,

1065
00:59:07,918 --> 00:59:08,918
(Applause).

1066
00:59:08,918 --> 00:59:09,918
All right.

1067
00:59:09,918 --> 00:59:12,584
So we are going to go ahead

1068
00:59:12,584 --> 00:59:14,999
Beverage cooling contraption,

1069
00:59:14,999 --> 00:59:18,959
and Hebrew number 2,

1070
00:59:21,459 --> 00:59:25,709
They won by stacking cups on top

1071
00:59:25,709 --> 00:59:27,417
through it.

1072
00:59:27,709 --> 00:59:31,334
These other two, they were able

1073
00:59:32,709 --> 00:59:34,999
That's commonly used

1074
00:59:34,999 --> 00:59:37,876
but they did exceptional work.

1075
00:59:37,959 --> 00:59:39,501
We got a lot of good information.

1076
00:59:39,501 --> 00:59:41,751
Crack me if you can, I don't have

1077
00:59:41,834 --> 00:59:44,167
But the winner cracks hundreds

1078
00:59:44,167 --> 00:59:46,417
it's absolutely insane.

1079
00:59:46,751 --> 00:59:52,459
Inside Pro, and Team Hashcap,

1080
00:59:52,459 --> 00:59:54,584
at DEF CON.

1081
00:59:54,999 --> 01:00:00,083
Black bag, obviously you can see

1082
01:00:00,083 --> 01:00:03,000
I won't get into really hard core on,

1083
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,709
where people have to go

1084
01:00:05,709 --> 01:00:08,459
virtual security and having

1085
01:00:08,459 --> 01:00:10,999
to find files and photograph them

1086
01:00:10,999 --> 01:00:14,584
all of that information gets put back

1087
01:00:14,584 --> 01:00:16,626
they have been there.

1088
01:00:16,626 --> 01:00:18,042
True proper red teaming.

1089
01:00:18,042 --> 01:00:20,375
I love

1090
01:00:20,375 --> 01:00:24,375
gringo warrior

1091
01:00:24,667 --> 01:00:27,250
Winners porno clause

1092
01:00:27,250 --> 01:00:30,083
with Harriers and third place,

1093
01:00:30,083 --> 01:00:33,000
in the running swords of thunder.

1094
01:00:35,459 --> 01:00:39,584
Crash and compile, fink rules won this.

1095
01:00:39,584 --> 01:00:41,709
Are you familiar with crash

1096
01:00:41,709 --> 01:00:42,709
Did you get to see it?

1097
01:00:42,834 --> 01:00:44,167
It's great, isn't it?

1098
01:00:44,167 --> 01:00:45,542
I love watching really,

1099
01:00:45,542 --> 01:00:48,000
by getting punished by being drunk.

1100
01:00:48,209 --> 01:00:51,999
There was one guy

1101
01:00:51,999 --> 01:00:52,999
Over there.

1102
01:00:52,999 --> 01:00:53,999
See that awesome die.

1103
01:00:53,999 --> 01:00:55,999
That thing will kill you if it hits you.

1104
01:00:55,999 --> 01:00:56,501
They had to roll that

1105
01:00:56,501 --> 01:00:59,083
they would be writing their code in.

1106
01:00:59,501 --> 01:01:01,959
One guy was there to get the free beer.

1107
01:01:01,959 --> 01:01:04,999
He was like, a, compile, didn't work.

1108
01:01:04,999 --> 01:01:05,999
Drink.

1109
01:01:05,999 --> 01:01:07,542
B compile, didn't work.

1110
01:01:07,542 --> 01:01:08,542
Drink.

1111
01:01:08,999 --> 01:01:12,751
DEF CON scavenger hunt, Too Old

1112
01:01:12,751 --> 01:01:14,999
the winning team.

1113
01:01:16,999 --> 01:01:21,918
Indian Jonesin was team two

1114
01:01:22,292 --> 01:01:25,584
It was a crazy, crazy competition.

1115
01:01:26,667 --> 01:01:29,959
I really wanted to beat one

1116
01:01:29,959 --> 01:01:31,999
a 303 tune to me.

1117
01:01:31,999 --> 01:01:33,292
I hate that group.

1118
01:01:33,375 --> 01:01:35,125
They took our handle and logo.

1119
01:01:35,125 --> 01:01:36,999
Those guys are assholes.

1120
01:01:37,250 --> 01:01:39,083
Nobody ever came to get the points.

1121
01:01:40,459 --> 01:01:42,083
Exploit hackathon.

1122
01:01:43,083 --> 01:01:47,292
It came in and it was their first year

1123
01:01:47,334 --> 01:01:51,501
We didn't have anyone that was able

1124
01:01:51,501 --> 01:01:53,459
or the contest.

1125
01:01:53,459 --> 01:01:55,542
This year, toast kicked its ass!

1126
01:01:55,542 --> 01:01:57,626
So big props and big ups to him.

1127
01:01:58,083 --> 01:02:01,417
Hackers against humanity, this

1128
01:02:01,417 --> 01:02:03,125
If you guys have not seen this,

1129

1130
01:02:05,167 --> 01:02:08,167
You will be able to get the PDF

1131
01:02:08,167 --> 01:02:10,999
They have decks available

1132
01:02:10,999 --> 01:02:14,584
but the winning teams, Ass1,

1133
01:02:14,584 --> 01:02:17,334
and number three was Keith.

1134
01:02:17,417 --> 01:02:18,667
(Laughter).

1135
01:02:18,959 --> 01:02:23,125
Yeah, Keith.

1136
01:02:23,125 --> 01:02:24,542
What a good handle, buddy!

1137
01:02:24,542 --> 01:02:26,667
Nobody else here

1138
01:02:26,999 --> 01:02:29,959
Network forensic puzzle contest,

1139
01:02:29,959 --> 01:02:32,250
and Tom Pohl was number two.

1140
01:02:33,083 --> 01:02:37,083
Again, first year contest

1141
01:02:37,083 --> 01:02:38,626
They all different kinds

1142
01:02:38,626 --> 01:02:41,792
in order to win, different types

1143
01:02:41,792 --> 01:02:43,167
were there.

1144
01:02:43,167 --> 01:02:44,167
It was really cool.

1145
01:02:44,209 --> 01:02:45,999
Casey won,

1146
01:02:45,999 --> 01:02:49,918
and Enrique    What's

1147
01:02:49,918 --> 01:02:54,125
PYR0: Really horrible handles when

1148
01:02:54,125 --> 01:02:59,999
sign up with a contest,

1149
01:02:59,999 --> 01:03:01,459
Give them your handle.

1150
01:03:01,834 --> 01:03:04,709
Hack fortress,

1151
01:03:04,709 --> 01:03:06,083
Best team Forstress two player was

1152
01:03:06,083 --> 01:03:09,999
and winning team was Jolly & Friends

1153
01:03:12,834 --> 01:03:16,834
Again, you guys are kicking ass

1154
01:03:16,834 --> 01:03:18,999
I appreciate all the work that Logan

1155
01:03:18,999 --> 01:03:20,999
to bring that to DEF CON.

1156
01:03:20,999 --> 01:03:23,626
It's one of the more popular contests.

1157
01:03:24,083 --> 01:03:25,999
Definitely try it out.

1158
01:03:26,584 --> 01:03:29,501
If you can play the damn video game,

1159
01:03:29,501 --> 01:03:31,667
to do the lacquer side of it.

1160
01:03:31,999 --> 01:03:37,501
Hacker pyramid,

1161
01:03:37,876 --> 01:03:38,918
Lamb child.

1162
01:03:40,209 --> 01:03:43,083
It's over a microphone, I just kind

1163
01:03:43,083 --> 01:03:44,083
(Slurring).

1164
01:03:44,083 --> 01:03:48,417
But, yes, they won again.

1165
01:03:48,417 --> 01:03:49,709
This is two years in a row.

1166
01:03:49,709 --> 01:03:51,375
And they just absolutely go

1167
01:03:51,375 --> 01:03:52,999
single time.

1168
01:03:52,999 --> 01:03:55,083
You need

1169
01:03:55,083 --> 01:03:58,834
THE DARK TANGENT: Wait,

1170
01:03:58,834 --> 01:04:00,999
Canadian pennies.

1171
01:04:00,999 --> 01:04:04,584
He split them

1172
01:04:04,584 --> 01:04:09,209
I think it was

1173
01:04:09,209 --> 01:04:14,542
5,000 Canadian penny necklace

1174
01:04:14,959 --> 01:04:17,999
How can you carry 10,000 pennies

1175
01:04:17,999 --> 01:04:20,501
I expect to see another one next year

1176
01:04:20,501 --> 01:04:21,501
(Inaudible).

1177
01:04:21,501 --> 01:04:23,667
PYR0: There you go.

1178
01:04:23,667 --> 01:04:24,999

01:04:29,584 --> 01:04:31,709
For those of you who don't know what it

1182
01:04:31,709 --> 01:04:33,876
It's a fund set up to get hackers

1183
01:04:33,876 --> 01:04:36,999
to help them break into this community.

1184
01:04:37,292 --> 01:04:38,834
(Applause).

1185
01:04:39,125 --> 01:04:42,459
Pimp my rascal.

1186
01:04:42,999 --> 01:04:44,125
This was awesome!

1187
01:04:44,125 --> 01:04:46,999
If you guys didn't see

1188
01:04:46,999 --> 01:04:51,999
out with lights and an IV drip

1189
01:04:52,334 --> 01:04:54,999
We can't announce a winner

1190
01:04:54,999 --> 01:04:57,999
the best ones all work on my staff

1191
01:04:57,999 --> 01:05:01,417
allowed to participate

1192
01:05:01,417 --> 01:05:03,209
So next year, go enter rascal.

1193
01:05:03,209 --> 01:05:04,542
I was going to bring it up.

1194
01:05:04,542 --> 01:05:06,834
It's $70 for the entire weekend

1195
01:05:06,834 --> 01:05:10,792
to walk around so that your feet aren't

1196
01:05:10,959 --> 01:05:13,083
Project two, ponies.

1197
01:05:16,125 --> 01:05:19,292
Team RDG, yeah, dyslexia is a bitch!

1198
01:05:19,292 --> 01:05:22,999
And then PTFS and then soapy,

1199
01:05:22,999 --> 01:05:26,417
is another one of those where

1200
01:05:26,417 --> 01:05:31,792
they spend year round getting ready

1201
01:05:31,792 --> 01:05:34,999
up and ask to play project 2.

1202
01:05:36,918 --> 01:05:42,667
It's a fun multi approach type

1203
01:05:42,667 --> 01:05:43,999
Definitely look into it.

1204
01:05:44,083 --> 01:05:46,417
Beard and mustache contest.

1205
01:05:46,417 --> 01:05:47,999
You can see the winners up there.

1206
01:05:47,999 --> 01:05:49,876
I won't go through each one of them.

1207
01:05:49,876 --> 01:05:51,334
This year,

1208
01:05:51,334 --> 01:05:53,459
he will step down.

1209
01:05:53,459 --> 01:05:55,501
I guess he will try to hand

1210
01:05:55,501 --> 01:05:59,999
if he's interested in running it,

1211
01:06:01,584 --> 01:06:03,250
Red beard

1212
01:06:03,250 --> 01:06:06,083
with a brand new competition

1213
01:06:06,083 --> 01:06:09,083
tell you anything about it,

1214
01:06:09,083 --> 01:06:11,792
but you do not want to miss it!

1215
01:06:11,792 --> 01:06:13,209
In my opinion, it's going to be one

1216
01:06:13,209 --> 01:06:15,999
first year competitions we have ever

1217
01:06:16,667 --> 01:06:19,083
Snowden look a like contest.

1218
01:06:20,083 --> 01:06:22,999
Now, this was

1219
01:06:22,999 --> 01:06:26,292
and a half before we gotten,

1220
01:06:26,292 --> 01:06:28,375
down and closed.

1221
01:06:28,667 --> 01:06:31,792
When he called me up, we had to do it.

1222
01:06:31,792 --> 01:06:32,999
Red snow won.

1223
01:06:32,999 --> 01:06:35,250
The real Edward Snowden came

1224
01:06:35,626 --> 01:06:37,501
Snowy was number three.

1225
01:06:37,501 --> 01:06:40,250
And ionic was number four

1226
01:06:40,250 --> 01:06:41,999
number five.

1227
01:06:42,375 --> 01:06:45,584
Tamper evident this year,

1228
01:06:45,584 --> 01:06:47,542
It's become such a popular contest

1229
01:06:47,542 --> 01:06:49,709
tamper evident

1230
01:06:49,709 --> 01:06:51,083
up sharing

1231
01:06:51,083 --> 01:06:53,334
they did their competition,

1232
01:06:53,334 --> 01:06:55,083
to see people wandering

1233
01:06:55,083 --> 01:06:57,334
of learning the technologies.

1234
01:06:57,334 --> 01:07:00,125
Jeff created this contest three years

1235
01:07:00,125 --> 01:07:03,834
Ago and in its incredible

1236
01:07:03,876 --> 01:07:10,083
This year, first place, winner was

1237
01:07:10,083 --> 01:07:18,167
the mother fucking professionals

1238

You did an exception job.

1239
01:07:22,709 --> 01:07:25,876
Again to all the villages,

1240
01:07:26,167 --> 01:07:27,501
(Applause).

1241
01:07:31,250 --> 01:07:35,834
This is a first year competition,

1242
01:07:36,876 --> 01:07:40,834
The winners were Friday,

1243
01:07:40,834 --> 01:07:46,501
to make a recommendation next year,

1244
01:07:46,501 --> 01:07:48,999
Jeff gets the final say

1245
01:07:48,999 --> 01:07:50,999
I make the recommendations

1246
01:07:50,999 --> 01:07:55,459
work and effort they had to put

1247
01:07:58,999 --> 01:08:01,501
(Applause) Scheme averse, this

1248
01:08:01,501 --> 01:08:04,999
in and hacking a huge database,

1249
01:08:05,083 --> 01:08:08,083
Shepherd took first place, Yin got

1250
01:08:10,999 --> 01:08:12,834
And final bit Goyne Penopolus

1251
01:08:12,834 --> 01:08:15,167
the best hack was Yin and Shepherd.

1252
01:08:15,167 --> 01:08:17,375
They were talking

1253
01:08:17,375 --> 01:08:19,999
I guess, one of the guys,

1254
01:08:19,999 --> 01:08:24,209
and loaded his thing completely full

1255
01:08:24,209 --> 01:08:26,083
get any money.

1256
01:08:26,250 --> 01:08:27,501
(Applause).

1257
01:08:27,751 --> 01:08:30,751

1262
01:08:55,626 --> 01:08:58,334
Each one of them a different style

1263
01:08:58,334 --> 01:09:01,626
Total Harronic Distort Plus N was

1264
01:09:01,626 --> 01:09:04,751
number two and he functioned alone.

1265
01:09:04,751 --> 01:09:08,501
He was all on his own and Simon J was

1266
01:09:09,292 --> 01:09:11,999

1277
01:09:41,459 --> 01:09:46,417

Give them their black badge.

You have to make room

1305
01:11:07,375 --> 01:11:09,999
Pardon me as I fall off the stage

1306

01:12:42,083 --> 01:12:44,292
Not yet, anyway.

1332
01:12:44,292 --> 01:12:45,626
They did not fuck it up!

1333
01:12:45,626 --> 01:12:46,626
That much.

1334
01:12:46,626 --> 01:12:47,626
(Humming).

1335
01:12:47,626 --> 01:12:48,626
Congratulations!

1339
01:12:53,083 --> 01:13:07,959
THE DARK TANGENT: Okay.

1340
01:13:07,959 --> 01:13:11,999
We are going to jump

1341
01:13:11,999 --> 01:13:13,250
We have to a little bit

1342
01:13:13,250 --> 01:13:15,125
to run for an airplane.

1343
01:13:15,459 --> 01:13:17,125
And we can't take

1344
01:13:17,125 --> 01:13:20,501
because this is too much

1345
01:13:20,626 --> 01:13:24,209
As if you have been paying attention,

1346
01:13:24,209 --> 01:13:27,918
I wanted to grow size of the scope

1347
01:13:27,918 --> 01:13:31,417
and turn it into the World Series

1348
01:13:31,959 --> 01:13:34,999
And with the new organizers, legit BS,

1349
01:13:34,999 --> 01:13:37,542
the contest more transparent.

1350
01:13:37,918 --> 01:13:40,083
And they have also continued

1351
01:13:40,083 --> 01:13:43,999
of having teams that have qualified

1352
01:13:43,999 --> 01:13:46,167
around the world, prequalify,

1353
01:13:46,167 --> 01:13:51,125
from the previous year gets seeded

1354
01:13:52,334 --> 01:13:54,626
We had a team

1355
01:13:54,626 --> 01:13:58,375
from other countries that never

1356
01:13:58,459 --> 01:14:00,876
And it's really been

1357
01:14:00,876 --> 01:14:02,999
I want to have legit BS come

1360
01:14:09,083 --> 01:14:12,999

01:14:28,751 --> 01:14:32,667
and we are proud

1367
01:14:32,667 --> 01:14:36,999
the DEF CON 21 capture the flag event.

1368
01:14:36,999 --> 01:14:38,876
We are up here and we are going

1369
01:14:38,876 --> 01:14:41,584
a quick summary of what

1370
01:14:41,667 --> 01:14:43,542
So first of all, we would

1371
01:14:43,542 --> 01:14:45,792
for taking a chance on us.

1372
01:14:47,417 --> 01:14:48,834
(Applause).

1373
01:14:50,459 --> 01:14:52,709
We would also like to thank

1374
01:14:52,709 --> 01:14:56,083
for keeping our room clean

1375
01:14:57,375 --> 01:14:58,834
(Applause).

1376
01:14:59,999 --> 01:15:02,999
We would like to thank

1377
01:15:02,999 --> 01:15:05,250
for providing

1378
01:15:05,250 --> 01:15:07,999
throughout the whole competition.

1379
01:15:09,501 --> 01:15:10,959
(Applause).

1380
01:15:12,459 --> 01:15:15,459
And finally, we would like to thank

1381
01:15:15,459 --> 01:15:18,250
for running

1382
01:15:20,459 --> 01:15:21,918
(Applause).

1383
01:15:23,999 --> 01:15:27,542
So this year, we limited teams

1384
01:15:27,626 --> 01:15:30,083
And to support this,

1385
01:15:30,083 --> 01:15:32,792
services to torment them with.

1386
01:15:32,834 --> 01:15:35,209
We also ran the game

1387
01:15:35,209 --> 01:15:37,334
for the first time.

1388
01:15:37,334 --> 01:15:42,083
So what this meant was each team had

1389
01:15:42,667 --> 01:15:47,375
It made it a lot easier for us

1390
01:15:47,375 --> 01:15:52,959
the teams without their well owned X86

1391
01:15:54,209 --> 01:15:56,999
So DEF CON capture the flag

1392
01:15:56,999 --> 01:15:59,918
of computer security competition.

1393
01:15:59,918 --> 01:16:02,083
Some teams ended with very,

1394
01:16:02,083 --> 01:16:05,918
but they competed well with great skill.

1395
01:16:06,250 --> 01:16:11,083
And up next,

1396
01:16:12,459 --> 01:16:15,209
Show them the computer again.

1397
01:16:15,209 --> 01:16:17,834
For you that didn't appreciate it.

1398
01:16:17,834 --> 01:16:19,250
That is the computer that

1399
01:16:19,250 --> 01:16:21,459
protecting and hosting.

1400
01:16:21,626 --> 01:16:27,876
In the past, the organizers have literally

1401
01:16:27,876 --> 01:16:33,792
They hosted all of it in one 1U

1402
01:16:33,792 --> 01:16:34,876
It's was amazing.

1403
01:16:34,999 --> 01:16:36,999
Glug, glug, dude!

1404
01:16:36,999 --> 01:16:37,999
(Applause).

1405
01:16:37,999 --> 01:16:38,999
All right.

1406
01:16:43,375 --> 01:16:45,083
Hi, I'm Gynophage.

1407
01:16:46,375 --> 01:16:49,250
Second and third place teams

1408
01:16:49,250 --> 01:16:51,584
they played the game on so

1409
01:16:51,584 --> 01:16:53,999
up to first place next year.

1410
01:16:53,999 --> 01:16:57,918
They will receive that after closing

1411
01:16:57,918 --> 01:16:59,999
Do not come

1412
01:17:00,083 --> 01:17:03,083
First place

1413
01:17:03,501 --> 01:17:05,709
In third place we had RayonASRT.

1414
01:17:05,709 --> 01:17:06,709
(Applause).

1415
01:17:06,709 --> 01:17:18,584
In second place, we had the men

1416
01:17:24,999 --> 01:17:25,999
(Applause).

1417
01:17:25,999 --> 01:17:29,417
And in first place, we had PPP,

1418
01:17:31,834 --> 01:17:33,083
(Applause).

1419
01:17:35,459 --> 01:17:37,083
Thanks, everybody.

1420
01:17:37,083 --> 01:17:38,999
Winning team, please come on up.

1421
01:17:38,999 --> 01:17:48,959
You've got to give them their badge.

1422
01:17:48,959 --> 01:17:49,959
Run!

1423
01:17:49,959 --> 01:17:52,584
Yeah, DT asked

1424
01:17:52,584 --> 01:18:00,083
This, I believe,

1425
01:18:00,083 --> 01:18:12,918
the DEF CON CTF., though

1426
01:18:12,918 --> 01:18:13,918
(Applause).

1427
01:18:13,918 --> 01:18:14,918
All right.

1428
01:18:14,918 --> 01:18:15,918
Yeah.

1429
01:18:15,918 --> 01:18:16,999
How many is your team?

1430
01:18:16,999 --> 01:18:17,999
Eight people.

1431
01:18:17,999 --> 01:18:17,999
Thank you for legitimate BS

1432
01:18:17,999 --> 01:18:19,417
especially for your first time

1433

1434
01:18:22,584 --> 01:18:24,083

1435
01:18:24,083 --> 01:18:27,667
Our secret techniques are secret.

1436
01:18:29,250 --> 01:18:30,709
(Applause).

1437
01:18:32,292 --> 01:18:35,959

So whoever gets the messed

1440
01:18:39,999 --> 01:18:41,375

1441
01:18:41,375 --> 01:18:43,999
PYR0: There you go, Jeff

1442
01:18:45,209 --> 01:18:47,792
I can't touch anything

1443
01:18:47,792 --> 01:18:48,792
Drink!

(Applause).

1446
01:19:09,125 --> 01:19:19,751
I can fix it!

1447
01:19:19,751 --> 01:19:21,083
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Drink!

1448
01:19:21,083 --> 01:19:25,792

Oh, yeah.

1450
01:19:26,792 --> 01:19:27,792
Okay.

1451
01:19:29,999 --> 01:19:33,667
The social engineering CTF.

1452
01:19:33,667 --> 01:19:34,667
PYR0: Yeah.

1453
01:19:34,667 --> 01:19:35,083
THE DARK TANGENT: For some

1454
01:19:35,083 --> 01:19:37,083
and we don't know who won.

1455
01:19:37,083 --> 01:19:39,209
So you will have to come up here

1456
01:19:40,250 --> 01:19:41,999
What is my time?

1457
01:19:43,667 --> 01:19:44,999
Okay.

1458
01:19:44,999 --> 01:19:47,292
So I want to take a couple of seconds

1459
01:19:47,292 --> 01:19:51,876
in the audience who kept flagging DEF

1460
01:19:51,999 --> 01:19:53,999
You made it possible.

1461
01:19:55,667 --> 01:19:58,375
For the guys who moved into our room,

1462
01:19:58,375 --> 01:20:00,792
and cool and thank you for that.

1463
01:20:00,792 --> 01:20:02,459
I really, really appreciate that.

1464
01:20:02,459 --> 01:20:04,584
Pyr0 I love you.

1465
01:20:07,334 --> 01:20:10,417
And Cheryl, is she not the queen

1466
01:20:10,417 --> 01:20:14,542
PYR0: For those who don't know

1467
01:20:15,501 --> 01:20:17,417
She's the event coordinator

1468
01:20:17,417 --> 01:20:20,959
and fire marshals and the hotel,

1469
01:20:20,959 --> 01:20:22,459
Give her a big round of applause.

1470
01:20:22,459 --> 01:20:24,751
Yeah, seriously.

1471
01:20:24,918 --> 01:20:25,999
Seriously.

1472
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:27,167
(Applause).

1473
01:20:27,334 --> 01:20:29,375
And

1474
01:20:29,375 --> 01:20:33,209
around the hallway, give her a hug.

1475
01:20:34,167 --> 01:20:36,876
She's still working and we are

1476
01:20:37,334 --> 01:20:39,292
Where is DT.

1477
01:20:39,292 --> 01:20:40,292
Thank you.

1478
01:20:40,292 --> 01:20:41,834
Awesome, awesome this year.

1479
01:20:42,042 --> 01:20:46,584
I want to say thank you

1480
01:20:46,584 --> 01:20:48,417
What we did,

1481
01:20:48,417 --> 01:20:50,626
I won't go

1482
01:20:50,626 --> 01:20:53,292
But I want to say, ladies,

1483
01:20:53,292 --> 01:20:56,999
I mean, you just murdered us!

1484
01:20:56,999 --> 01:20:57,999
Really, seriously.

1485
01:20:57,999 --> 01:20:59,334
For the women, for the women!

1486
01:20:59,334 --> 01:21:00,334
Wow!

1487
01:21:06,584 --> 01:21:08,959
(Applause) I don't normally do this.

1488
01:21:09,083 --> 01:21:11,292
There were hundreds

1489
01:21:11,292 --> 01:21:17,209
in between the first place winner,

1490
01:21:17,209 --> 01:21:19,459
That's how awesome

1491
01:21:19,459 --> 01:21:20,999
It just blew us out of the water.

1492
01:21:20,999 --> 01:21:22,999
I'm a little embarrassed to be up here.

1493
01:21:22,999 --> 01:21:24,542
I should have had Michele do it.

1494
01:21:24,999 --> 01:21:27,375
Before I get there, I want

1495
01:21:27,375 --> 01:21:30,792
Without this, without Eric, Mack, Jim,

1496
01:21:30,792 --> 01:21:35,083
this stuff would have never lapped this

1497
01:21:35,999 --> 01:21:38,501
Lily has a flight,

1498
01:21:38,501 --> 01:21:41,542
because she won first place, 7:20.

1499
01:21:41,542 --> 01:21:43,667
So get her up here, and Lori, Lori,

1500
01:21:43,667 --> 01:21:45,751

1501

That's lily.

1516

Thank you very much.

1517
01:22:36,959 --> 01:22:39,876
Go get your plane.

1518
01:22:39,999 --> 01:22:43,167
I got one minute left,

1519
01:22:43,167 --> 01:22:46,876
Lori gets a similar thing, just not

1520
01:22:46,876 --> 01:22:48,334
A bump pick and a lockpick,

1521

(Applause).

1525
01:22:56,083 --> 01:22:57,250
See you guys next year.

1526
01:22:57,250 --> 01:22:58,250
(Applause).

1527
01:22:58,250 --> 01:23:11,083
PYR0: All right and at that point I

There they are.

1535
01:23:43,459 --> 01:23:44,999
We have capture the packet.

1536
01:23:49,751 --> 01:23:54,542
What did you think

1537
01:23:59,999 --> 01:24:01,209
Yeah?

1538
01:24:01,751 --> 01:24:08,167
This year so capture a packet

1539
01:24:13,167 --> 01:24:18,083
We have to sort

1540
01:24:18,083 --> 01:24:21,083
was my little ponies.

1541
01:24:21,999 --> 01:24:28,959
The kids competition    It explains

1542
01:24:28,999 --> 01:24:34,626
But second place was Digirev

1543
01:24:34,626 --> 01:24:39,459
scored 2500 points and thanks

1544
01:24:39,459 --> 01:24:46,209
donated two MacBook Pros to them

1545
01:24:46,542 --> 01:24:50,959
We trained

1546
01:24:50,959 --> 01:24:52,792
You want to have them come up?

1547
01:24:52,792 --> 01:24:55,459
Are you out here, Sam Seiler?

1548
01:24:56,125 --> 01:25:00,250
All right, come on up.

1549
01:25:00,250 --> 01:25:01,501
I've got plenty of time.

1550
01:25:01,501 --> 01:25:03,209
I could stay up here.

1551
01:25:08,083 --> 01:25:09,999
Where are the badges?

1552
01:25:09,999 --> 01:25:12,083
Someone give them to me.

1553
01:25:12,167 --> 01:25:13,999
Are these them?

1554
01:25:14,375 --> 01:25:17,292
There's another one.

1555
01:25:17,292 --> 01:25:19,083
They are going to share one badge.

1556
01:25:19,083 --> 01:25:22,459
I think one is going to sneak in and

1557
01:25:22,459 --> 01:25:23,459
Here's the one.

1558
01:25:23,459 --> 01:25:24,459
All right.

1559
01:25:26,709 --> 01:25:28,375
Good job, guys.

1560
01:25:28,375 --> 01:25:30,083
You did an amazing job.

1561
01:25:35,709 --> 01:25:38,083
And look for us next year

1562
01:25:38,083 --> 01:25:40,375
a lot harder challenges.

1563
01:25:40,375 --> 01:25:43,999
Yeah, since we still have time

1564
01:25:43,999 --> 01:25:45,959
We will hog it.

1565
01:25:45,959 --> 01:25:47,876
Really quickly, one

1566
01:25:47,876 --> 01:25:52,250
in a little bit of physical security

1567
01:25:52,250 --> 01:25:54,918
So the challenge, you had to pull

1568
01:25:54,918 --> 01:25:57,667
out of the stream and then figure

1569
01:25:57,667 --> 01:25:59,999
and that was the answer.

1570
01:26:00,209 --> 01:26:03,083
So good luck next year.

1571
01:26:03,250 --> 01:26:05,999
Try a little harder for those

1572
01:26:06,626 --> 01:26:07,792
ehhh.

1573
01:26:07,792 --> 01:26:10,834
But we had a whole bunch of stuff

1574
01:26:10,876 --> 01:26:16,918
We trained 200 people that didn't know

1575
01:26:16,918 --> 01:26:21,209
from zero to capturing a lot of traffic.

1576
01:26:21,334 --> 01:26:22,751
Come to us and learn.

1577
01:26:22,751 --> 01:26:24,501
We have a lot of time left

1578
01:26:24,501 --> 01:26:26,667
the Wi Fi sheep hunt.

1579
01:26:26,667 --> 01:26:28,209
It was the second year.

1580
01:26:28,417 --> 01:26:33,999
We put RFID tags on all the goons

1581
01:26:33,999 --> 01:26:38,250
You had to run into two goons

1582
01:26:38,250 --> 01:26:40,209
with    Here.

1583
01:26:40,209 --> 01:26:41,209
I will go.

1584
01:26:41,209 --> 01:26:42,918
We tagged them with NFC tags.

1585
01:26:42,959 --> 01:26:45,999
This is an NFC tag poster.

1586
01:26:45,999 --> 01:26:48,459
And kind of strange, you know,

1587
01:26:48,459 --> 01:26:50,999
these tags

1588
01:26:50,999 --> 01:26:52,751
yeah, free stuff.

1589
01:26:52,751 --> 01:26:53,751
Let's do.

1590
01:26:53,751 --> 01:26:55,834
This you put your phones up there

1591
01:26:55,834 --> 01:26:58,999
the badges on all of these other people.

1592
01:26:58,999 --> 01:27:00,999
And, you know, we are stand

1593
01:27:00,999 --> 01:27:03,083
and we brick rolled you.

1594
01:27:03,083 --> 01:27:05,918
We gave you discounts on stuff

1595
01:27:05,918 --> 01:27:09,667
but we also showed a demo

1596
01:27:09,667 --> 01:27:13,375
on your phone and then

1597
01:27:13,375 --> 01:27:15,667
to any one of us.

1598
01:27:15,667 --> 01:27:17,083
So be very careful.

1599
01:27:17,083 --> 01:27:18,250
Use this with caution.

1600
01:27:18,250 --> 01:27:19,999
I'm getting some of yours now.

1601
01:27:20,083 --> 01:27:21,083
So    Thanks

1602
01:27:21,083 --> 01:27:23,999
of sheep, capture the packet, everyone,

1603
01:27:23,999 --> 01:27:25,125
And thanks Jeff.

1604
01:27:25,125 --> 01:27:26,125
(Applause).

1605
01:27:26,125 --> 01:27:40,459
LosT: So what did you guys think

1606
01:27:40,959 --> 01:27:42,209
(Applause).

1607
01:27:42,709 --> 01:27:47,999
So we had a lot of people participating.

1608
01:27:47,999 --> 01:27:50,459
It came down to the wire

1609
01:27:50,459 --> 01:27:53,999
It was two teams that were, like,

1610
01:27:53,999 --> 01:27:58,083
I think that stands

1611
01:27:58,083 --> 01:28:00,667
pulled out in front.

1612
01:28:01,709 --> 01:28:04,999
If you guys are here, come on up, like,

1613
01:28:04,999 --> 01:28:05,999
We are in a hurry.

1614
01:28:06,959 --> 01:28:07,999
The MLF guys.

1615
01:28:07,999 --> 01:28:08,999
(Applause).

1616
01:28:08,999 --> 01:28:09,999
Give them a hand.

1617
01:28:09,999 --> 01:28:18,250
So for those of you who don't know,

1618
01:28:18,250 --> 01:28:21,626
on the contest.

1619
01:28:21,792 --> 01:28:23,751
They had to collect information

1620
01:28:23,751 --> 01:28:25,999
of the badge that's

1621
01:28:25,999 --> 01:28:29,083
the press, the speakers,

1622
01:28:29,083 --> 01:28:32,459
They had to do all types of OTPing

1623
01:28:32,459 --> 01:28:35,584
each suit was

1624
01:28:35,584 --> 01:28:39,999
they had to OTP all of those to go

1625
01:28:39,999 --> 01:28:41,876
a lot to it.

1626
01:28:41,876 --> 01:28:43,959
It took them pretty much

1627
01:28:43,959 --> 01:28:46,667
So we got one here and due

1628
01:28:46,667 --> 01:28:48,792
we are one short.

1629
01:28:48,792 --> 01:28:51,709
So you are getting actually three black

1630
01:28:51,709 --> 01:28:53,542
So everybody thanks to Jeff for that.

1631
01:28:58,542 --> 01:28:59,999
(Applause).

1632
01:29:05,083 --> 01:29:05,375
So, you know,

1633
01:29:05,375 --> 01:29:06,542
winning technique?

1634
01:29:06,542 --> 01:29:08,167
LosT: Do you want to take

1635
01:29:08,167 --> 01:29:10,999
and tell something about what you did?

1636
01:29:10,999 --> 01:29:14,834
Time and alcohol

1637
01:29:14,834 --> 01:29:19,083
but looking at the code and that's it.

1638
01:29:19,083 --> 01:29:22,999
I mean, that's really all we did

1639
01:29:22,999 --> 01:29:24,250
LosT: What was something that was

1640
01:29:24,250 --> 01:29:25,667
oh, my God.

1641
01:29:25,751 --> 01:29:27,626
The last thing was    LosT: I kind

1642
01:29:27,626 --> 01:29:29,459
at the very end they had

1643
01:29:29,459 --> 01:29:32,209
and I said it has to be written

1644
01:29:32,459 --> 01:29:33,751
(Laughter).

1645
01:29:33,999 --> 01:29:37,125
Just one more thing to drive them nuts.

1646
01:29:37,125 --> 01:29:37,959
So they worked hard to get

1647
01:29:37,959 --> 01:29:41,584
they are racing other teams and

1648
01:29:41,584 --> 01:29:43,792
They're like,

1649
01:29:43,792 --> 01:29:46,792
I saw them running

1650
01:29:46,792 --> 01:29:47,792
Yeah.

1651
01:29:47,792 --> 01:29:50,167
LosT: Anyway, guys,

1652
01:29:50,167 --> 01:29:53,334
It's an incredibly difficult competition.

1653
01:29:53,876 --> 01:29:56,125
(Applause) So.

1654
01:29:56,709 --> 01:30:00,999
Again, I hope you guys liked

1655
01:30:00,999 --> 01:30:03,999
I'm always open to suggestions

1656
01:30:03,999 --> 01:30:08,042
had a little bit of fun looking

1657
01:30:08,042 --> 01:30:09,999
PYR0: Make one that I can't break.

1658
01:30:09,999 --> 01:30:13,999
THE DARK TANGENT: Have you

1659
01:30:14,125 --> 01:30:17,999
When LosT has been working on it,

1660
01:30:17,999 --> 01:30:22,709
the physical badge and then last year,

1661
01:30:22,751 --> 01:30:24,751
And then this year it was physical.

1662
01:30:24,751 --> 01:30:25,751
Hmm.

1663
01:30:25,751 --> 01:30:29,999
I wonder what next year's will be?

1664
01:30:29,999 --> 01:30:31,000
LosT: I don't know.

1665
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:33,999
Anyway, yeah, so I tried to    Yeah,

1666
01:30:33,999 --> 01:30:35,083
LosT: So

1667
01:30:35,083 --> 01:30:38,584
on the badges, that was actually

1668
01:30:39,250 --> 01:30:41,959
They had do different things with OTPs.

1669
01:30:41,959 --> 01:30:43,459
I hope you enjoyed the stuff.

1670
01:30:43,459 --> 01:30:44,459
(Applause).

1671
01:30:44,459 --> 01:30:55,250
THE DARK TANGENT: All right.

1672
01:30:55,250 --> 01:30:59,626
So that winds up the awards ceremony.

1673
01:30:59,626 --> 01:31:00,083
So I have got just a couple

1674
01:31:00,083 --> 01:31:01,918
minor announcements.

1675
01:31:01,918 --> 01:31:03,959
One is a reminder for those

1676
01:31:03,959 --> 01:31:06,501
if you are missing a badge,

1677
01:31:06,501 --> 01:31:09,584
you don't have a real badge,

1678
01:31:09,584 --> 01:31:11,792
of real badges up here.

1679
01:31:11,792 --> 01:31:12,584
We will swap out, we

1680
01:31:12,584 --> 01:31:15,209
and give you

1681
01:31:15,334 --> 01:31:18,209
And then I also have

1682
01:31:18,209 --> 01:31:21,083

but they are doing an after party,

1684
01:31:25,250 --> 01:31:26,417
Everybody is invited.

1685

I would like to see you all fit!

1686
01:31:31,125 --> 01:31:32,584
(Laughter).

1687
01:31:34,999 --> 01:31:37,959
But, I mean, what do I know.

1688
01:31:37,959 --> 01:31:40,876
I've got a text message and he's like,

1689
01:31:41,334 --> 01:31:42,792
