1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:03,167
ERIC MILAM: How's it going?

2
00:00:03,167 --> 00:00:04,709
First I want to say, holy shit, I'm speaking at DEF CON,

3
00:00:04,709 --> 00:00:06,459
and it's an honor.

4
00:00:06,709 --> 00:00:10,459
And second of all, holy shit, people showed up and that's

5
00:00:10,459 --> 00:00:12,792
an honor as well.

6
00:00:12,918 --> 00:00:16,751
I will talk to you about getting the goods with smbexec.

7
00:00:17,876 --> 00:00:24,167
Some of you may know me as brav0hax.

8
00:00:28,542 --> 00:00:30,876
I'm on the Accuvant LABS attack and pen team.

9
00:00:33,999 --> 00:00:37,250
I'm involved with some open source projects

10
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:41,042
and maybe you have heard of Easy Creds and smbexec

11
00:00:41,042 --> 00:00:46,083
and Ettercap, and we're involved with the Kali Linux.

12
00:00:50,918 --> 00:00:55,334
We will go over what is smbexec and there's nothing 0day here.

13
00:00:58,999 --> 00:01:01,542
But automation is awesome.

14
00:01:04,417 --> 00:01:07,999
This is not that the sun and the moon have to align on a certain day.

15
00:01:08,584 --> 00:01:10,959
It makes post exploitation much easier.

16
00:01:10,959 --> 00:01:11,999
At least it has for me.

17
00:01:13,792 --> 00:01:16,083
So what is smbexec?

18
00:01:17,459 --> 00:01:19,167
It's a Bash script.

19
00:01:19,167 --> 00:01:20,083
Everybody who knows me, knows I don't know how

20
00:01:20,083 --> 00:01:21,876
to code for shit.

21
00:01:21,999 --> 00:01:23,999
I'm very good with the Googles and I put a bunch

22
00:01:23,999 --> 00:01:26,626
of shit together until works.

23
00:01:26,751 --> 00:01:30,083
It's about 1500 lines and a million different functions.

24
00:01:30,501 --> 00:01:33,918
Put it together in a week, about an hour's worth of time

25
00:01:33,918 --> 00:01:37,167
and a year's worth of Mountain Due.

26
00:01:40,334 --> 00:01:44,125
It relies on SMB client, and we have PAP system

27
00:01:44,125 --> 00:01:48,459
for hash passing and that works as well.

28
00:01:57,918 --> 00:01:59,999
Why would you need this?

29
00:01:59,999 --> 00:02:03,542
We are on a bunch of pen tests and we realized that

30
00:02:03,542 --> 00:02:06,999
the smbexec was getting popped.

31
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:13,959
And we threw it out to the community and basically

32
00:02:13,959 --> 00:02:16,083
Mubix, wherever they are.

33
00:02:16,083 --> 00:02:18,959
They found out real quick for us that basically what it was

34
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:23,417
triggering on was the injection and the service protection.

35
00:02:23,542 --> 00:02:27,083
So, you know, fuck you turn micro, but thank you for the motivation.

36
00:02:28,417 --> 00:02:34,209
After we ran into this, we found a blog post by Colonel Carnage

37
00:02:34,209 --> 00:02:39,083
and that's where the script was born from.

38
00:02:40,584 --> 00:02:45,709
So originally, right, we just wanted to get our shells.

39
00:02:45,709 --> 00:02:46,999
We wanted our shells.

40
00:02:46,999 --> 00:02:49,999
So we wrote it so it would create an obfuscated payload.

41
00:02:51,209 --> 00:02:56,334
The newer versions, you can enable Hyperion and encrypt it

42
00:02:56,334 --> 00:02:58,083
as well.

43
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:02,417
We also had it so it would create a metasploit rc file, and

44
00:03:02,417 --> 00:03:07,667
if it doesn't recognize X is running, it will automatically launch

45
00:03:07,667 --> 00:03:10,709
the attacks in the screen.

46
00:03:10,999 --> 00:03:12,999
That's where it was at.

47
00:03:14,792 --> 00:03:18,459
And then we started learning a little bit more about winexe.

48
00:03:19,792 --> 00:03:22,959
We can run native Windows commands and there's a lot

49
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:26,417
of cool stuff we can probably end up doing.

50
00:03:26,792 --> 00:03:29,999
I'm not a Windows guy and I went to Google and Google told me what

51
00:03:29,999 --> 00:03:35,375
to do and we started realizing some of the great things we could do with it.

52
00:03:35,375 --> 00:03:39,292
What we really wanted the tool to do is basically kind of go undetected

53
00:03:39,292 --> 00:03:42,292
and just look like normal Windows, you know,

54
00:03:42,292 --> 00:03:46,709
traffic or normal network traffic to our victims.

55
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:52,999
So winexe, I don't know if anybody is familiar with it.

56
00:03:52,999 --> 00:03:53,999
I hope you guys are.

57
00:03:53,999 --> 00:03:54,999
It's awesome.

58
00:03:54,999 --> 00:03:58,334
It's similar to the system internal PSX I'm sorry,

59
00:03:58,334 --> 00:04:03,876
and it has systems flag and it has an uninstall flag and I

60
00:04:03,876 --> 00:04:07,999
will explain them in a little bit.

61
00:04:09,125 --> 00:04:12,125
There's no quote/unquote payload necessary.

62
00:04:12,125 --> 00:04:16,125
You can one winexe and just issue CMD and it will give you a shell back

63
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:20,959
from the victim community without executing a binary.

64
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:23,834
And it looks like normal windows traffic,

65
00:04:23,834 --> 00:04:26,375
basically you are getting what they should end up seeing

66
00:04:26,375 --> 00:04:29,250
is a successful log in over the network.

67
00:04:29,792 --> 00:04:32,501
There's some caveats that I will discuss later that might be

68
00:04:32,501 --> 00:04:33,999
red flags.

69
00:04:35,667 --> 00:04:38,125
So if you can execute commands as system,

70
00:04:38,125 --> 00:04:41,918
the possibilities are virtually limitless.

71
00:04:41,918 --> 00:04:45,083
So you can dump hashes from workstations and server,

72
00:04:45,083 --> 00:04:49,709
create volume shadow copy, run other tools as system, enable,

73
00:04:49,709 --> 00:04:53,334
disable UAC, bypass it, you can also check systems

74
00:04:53,334 --> 00:04:58,083
for DA/EA accounts logged in or running a process.

75
00:05:01,083 --> 00:05:05,959
Is that some type of sign for me or    I'm not fucking

76
00:05:05,959 --> 00:05:07,999
with anybody!

77
00:05:08,542 --> 00:05:10,751
You all know the drill.

78
00:05:10,751 --> 00:05:12,209
What does every new speaker do?

79
00:05:12,209 --> 00:05:13,876
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Drink!

80
00:05:13,876 --> 00:05:16,125
ERIC MILAM: So I'm Mormon.

81
00:05:16,501 --> 00:05:18,083
Not really.

82
00:05:19,626 --> 00:05:25,792
(Laughter) I'm a recovering Mormon, so    That's a good one.

83
00:05:25,792 --> 00:05:26,792
Cheers!

84
00:05:26,792 --> 00:05:27,792
Congratulations.

85
00:05:27,792 --> 00:05:28,999
ERIC MILAM: Thank you.

86
00:05:34,792 --> 00:05:36,999
(Applause)    As you were.

87
00:05:41,626 --> 00:05:44,292
Let's see him get back into it now.

88
00:05:44,292 --> 00:05:47,999
ERIC MILAM: Oh, you can't hear me.

89
00:05:47,999 --> 00:05:48,999
Okay.

90
00:05:48,999 --> 00:05:49,999
I know.

91
00:05:50,626 --> 00:05:52,083
All right.

92
00:05:52,083 --> 00:05:53,083
Is this better?

93
00:05:53,083 --> 00:05:54,375
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Yes.

94
00:05:54,375 --> 00:05:55,709
ERIC MILAM: All right.

95
00:05:55,709 --> 00:05:56,709
I apologize.

96
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:58,459
Okay.

97
00:05:58,459 --> 00:05:59,542
So where were we at?

98
00:05:59,542 --> 00:06:02,999
So basically we can execute shit as system, fuck it, we might as well.

99
00:06:05,999 --> 00:06:10,667
Man, is that the alcohol or what?

100
00:06:10,667 --> 00:06:11,667
(Laughter).

101
00:06:11,667 --> 00:06:15,209
So we're like holy fuck, let's get some hashing right?

102
00:06:15,209 --> 00:06:19,999
You know, old school way was to get the registry keys out and do it.

103
00:06:19,999 --> 00:06:21,375
So fuck, let's automate that.

104
00:06:21,375 --> 00:06:24,209
So we wrote smbexec to dump the hashes from work stations

105
00:06:24,209 --> 00:06:29,459
and servers and what it basically does is runs Windows com regularsec.

106
00:06:33,999 --> 00:06:36,792
And sys plus sam, and then we run it

107
00:06:36,792 --> 00:06:40,876
through cred dump which converts it into the hashes and

108
00:06:40,876 --> 00:06:46,999
the John format and then we have our high quality hash there as well.

109
00:06:48,751 --> 00:06:52,459
So one of the other things that I was on a pen test, somebody brought

110
00:06:52,459 --> 00:06:55,918
up to me was WCE, yes, I know about memi cats, the stuff that

111
00:06:55,918 --> 00:06:58,542
they have done with minisploit.

112
00:07:02,834 --> 00:07:04,959
I found this and it's awesome.

113
00:07:08,999 --> 00:07:12,083
And WCE, basically with the minus w flag

114
00:07:12,083 --> 00:07:16,709
will dump clear text passwords out of memory.

115
00:07:16,709 --> 00:07:19,959
So it took me about five lines of code to code that in it.

116
00:07:19,999 --> 00:07:22,999
It was super simple.

117
00:07:22,999 --> 00:07:24,167
It runs automagically.

118
00:07:25,375 --> 00:07:27,667
If you want to turn that off, you can.

119
00:07:27,667 --> 00:07:29,501
You can comment out the code.

120
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:32,834
So smbexec, we're like, shit, let's get stuff

121
00:07:32,834 --> 00:07:36,626
off the domain controller too while we're at it.

122
00:07:37,083 --> 00:07:41,209
Again, I went to my friend Google and Google told me how to go

123
00:07:41,209 --> 00:07:44,083
out and run everything from the command line

124
00:07:44,083 --> 00:07:48,125
and so what this will actually do is it will log in over 445,

125
00:07:48,125 --> 00:07:52,667
and create a volume shadow copy, and it will save off the NTDS.dit,

126
00:07:52,667 --> 00:07:54,417
the sys key.

127
00:07:54,542 --> 00:07:57,626
When it's done, it will clean up after itself.

128
00:07:57,626 --> 00:07:59,876
It will delete stuff it does on shadow copy.

129
00:08:00,083 --> 00:08:02,999
And I know there was a blog post in 2011 about this.

130
00:08:03,999 --> 00:08:07,292
There was actually a blog post and forum post back in 2005

131
00:08:07,292 --> 00:08:09,876
about doing this as well.

132
00:08:09,876 --> 00:08:12,125
So it's been around for a while.

133
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:13,125
It's there.

134
00:08:13,751 --> 00:08:17,501
Once everything is good, it runs NTDS extractor and Libby SDB

135
00:08:17,501 --> 00:08:20,459
and gets the hashes out for you.

136
00:08:20,459 --> 00:08:22,501
It creates a tab separated, cred list for you

137
00:08:22,501 --> 00:08:25,584
for other functions within smbexec.

138
00:08:26,751 --> 00:08:29,918
So let's go ahead and see a demo.

139
00:08:29,918 --> 00:08:31,250
So I recorded the demo.

140
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:32,751
So fuck it, we'll do it live!

141
00:08:37,999 --> 00:08:39,250
Okay.

142
00:08:44,626 --> 00:08:46,999
Does that look all right to you guys?

143
00:08:47,999 --> 00:08:51,876
All right.

144
00:08:51,876 --> 00:08:52,876
So that's smbexec.

145
00:08:52,876 --> 00:08:54,667
So first thing you are going to do, you are just going

146
00:08:54,667 --> 00:08:59,999
to really quickly just do system enumeration, create a quick host list.

147
00:09:05,626 --> 00:09:09,709
And basically what it's just doing is doing a quick Nmap scan

148
00:09:09,709 --> 00:09:12,792
and it builds the list for you.

149
00:09:12,792 --> 00:09:15,083
And then we'll go ahead and go into option three, which

150
00:09:15,083 --> 00:09:18,501
is obtain hashes, work stations and servers.

151
00:09:18,542 --> 00:09:19,999
Please provide the user name.

152
00:09:19,999 --> 00:09:21,834
I'm just going to spit it out here.

153
00:09:22,083 --> 00:09:23,959
This is Martin's password.

154
00:09:23,959 --> 00:09:24,959
(Laughter).

155
00:09:31,375 --> 00:09:33,709
So feel free, if you see pure hate anywhere,

156
00:09:33,709 --> 00:09:36,542
that's how you log into his accounts.

157
00:09:36,876 --> 00:09:42,334
Here's a local being, thanks to mimbix, it will give it a period or a dot, which

158
00:09:42,334 --> 00:09:46,375
is how developers recognize local hosts.

159
00:09:46,375 --> 00:09:49,709
And it recognizes that there was a host list created.

160
00:09:50,167 --> 00:09:54,667
This takes a little bit of time, you will see, it's basically what it's doing

161
00:09:54,667 --> 00:09:57,334
is it's going out and authenticating and logging

162
00:09:57,334 --> 00:10:01,000
into the box and pulling down the registry keys.

163
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,999
And then when that's done, it will basically upload my

164
00:10:03,999 --> 00:10:05,918
obfuscated WCE.

165
00:10:07,334 --> 00:10:09,292
It does take a little bit.

166
00:10:09,292 --> 00:10:38,876
Let he had hop over here and get this ready.

167
00:10:38,876 --> 00:10:41,751
I'm just getting rid of some of this stuff here that I know comes

168
00:10:41,751 --> 00:10:44,083
out of it, and then sort.

169
00:10:44,083 --> 00:10:45,542
Can everybody see that?

170
00:10:45,542 --> 00:10:47,918
I made the font super big so okay.

171
00:10:47,918 --> 00:10:48,918
Cool.

172
00:10:48,918 --> 00:10:51,876
AUDIENCE MEMBER: It's a little hard from the back.

173
00:10:51,876 --> 00:10:54,417
ERIC MILAM: I'm a little hard up here,

174
00:10:54,417 --> 00:10:58,751
but (Laughter)    ERIC MILAM: But I try.

175
00:11:01,999 --> 00:11:03,834
Is that a red card?

176
00:11:04,083 --> 00:11:05,209
Okay.

177
00:11:05,209 --> 00:11:08,209
So there we go, right/so basically, it's pretty much done.

178
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:15,542
There's local hashes.

179
00:11:16,501 --> 00:11:20,125
I want to give a shout out to Royce Davis on our team,

180
00:11:20,125 --> 00:11:25,417
who updated our team and took Carlos' cash grab and redid it so it's actually

181
00:11:25,417 --> 00:11:29,999
a work standalone and it does include vista and non vista versions

182
00:11:29,999 --> 00:11:35,083
and then here's what I love the most, if I could spell right.

183
00:11:36,999 --> 00:11:39,417
Boom, clear text passwords, right?

184
00:11:39,417 --> 00:11:42,876
So if you look at that, that's 20 characters.

185
00:11:42,876 --> 00:11:44,999
I mean, you are not going to crack that shit.

186
00:11:44,999 --> 00:11:45,999
There's no way.

187
00:11:45,999 --> 00:11:48,999
So it's awesome that, you know, you can just get out of there.

188
00:11:48,999 --> 00:11:51,083
So here's one here, top dog, brav0hax.

189
00:11:52,709 --> 00:11:55,667
So let's go off the domain controller.

190
00:11:55,667 --> 00:11:57,209
Go after the domain controller.

191
00:12:00,999 --> 00:12:03,751
I'm going to authenticate as top dog.

192
00:12:05,292 --> 00:12:08,167
This was Martin's old password.

193
00:12:11,459 --> 00:12:15,918
And then I know that the domain controller, of course, is this,

194
00:12:15,918 --> 00:12:19,292
but, you know, there's simple dit commands that you

195
00:12:19,292 --> 00:12:21,999
can look up and find it.

196
00:12:21,999 --> 00:12:23,999
It asks you for the path to the NTDS.dit.

197
00:12:23,999 --> 00:12:25,626
You can put any path or any drive.

198
00:12:25,626 --> 00:12:26,626
Oh!

199
00:12:26,626 --> 00:12:28,751
Oh, wait a second.

200
00:12:36,999 --> 00:12:42,417
It helps if I give it the correct IP address.

201
00:12:47,584 --> 00:12:48,959
Okay.

202
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:50,083
Found the NTDS.dit and now it says where do you want

203
00:12:50,083 --> 00:12:52,167
to save this stuff off to.

204
00:12:52,167 --> 00:12:53,959
You can give it a different path.

205
00:12:55,584 --> 00:12:59,999
So it checks to make sure that the path provided actually exists

206
00:12:59,999 --> 00:13:03,250
and it checks to make sure that there's disk space

207
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:05,626
and creates the volume shadow copy

208
00:13:05,626 --> 00:13:08,999
and copies them off to your machine and it deletes

209
00:13:08,999 --> 00:13:11,709
the files that were created and removes

210
00:13:11,709 --> 00:13:16,417
the volume shadow copy that it was created and then it runs Libya ESDB

211
00:13:16,417 --> 00:13:20,125
to extract it and it gets the hashes out.

212
00:13:20,125 --> 00:13:21,999
And you can see it's running there.

213
00:13:25,501 --> 00:13:27,751
It takes a little bit.

214
00:13:27,792 --> 00:13:31,083
Dramatic pause here and then success.

215
00:13:31,083 --> 00:13:33,167
It looks like what we got what we came for.

216
00:13:33,167 --> 00:13:34,876
So let's make sure that's true.

217
00:13:34,999 --> 00:13:46,501
So there you go.

218
00:13:46,501 --> 00:13:47,999
That's all the hashes off the domain controller right there

219
00:13:47,999 --> 00:13:49,375
for you.

220
00:13:49,375 --> 00:13:50,375
(Applause).

221
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:52,125
And it was like you were never there!

222
00:13:56,083 --> 00:13:59,999
So I have one other surprise for you.

223
00:14:04,626 --> 00:14:06,999
Might not be much of a surprise.

224
00:14:18,667 --> 00:14:21,709
That's our desktop, right?

225
00:14:21,999 --> 00:14:23,542
Oh, thank you.

226
00:14:23,584 --> 00:14:25,250
Thank you very much.

227
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:30,250
Hey, it's Windows Server 2012, what do you know?

228
00:14:30,375 --> 00:14:32,083
So this is going to work for a while!

229
00:14:32,083 --> 00:14:33,083
(Applause).

230
00:14:33,083 --> 00:14:34,083
All right.

231
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:44,751
So hold on.

232
00:14:44,751 --> 00:14:45,751
Sorry.

233
00:14:52,459 --> 00:14:53,626
Okay.

234
00:14:53,792 --> 00:14:56,626
So caveats, right, there's always caveats being right?

235
00:14:56,626 --> 00:14:58,876
You will need credentials to start with.

236
00:14:58,876 --> 00:15:00,792
You are going to need something with local admin rights,

237
00:15:00,792 --> 00:15:03,999
it could be a domain account or a local account.

238
00:15:04,375 --> 00:15:06,167
But administrator and password tends to work in nine

239
00:15:06,167 --> 00:15:08,876
out of the ten domains we pen test.

240
00:15:08,876 --> 00:15:09,999
So go and do that.

241
00:15:10,083 --> 00:15:14,083
Of course, there's NBNS spoofing and there's Ettercap.

242
00:15:19,999 --> 00:15:22,999
And so when someone is caring or paying attention,

243
00:15:22,999 --> 00:15:25,709
winexe creates a server that could be stopped

244
00:15:25,709 --> 00:15:27,999
or creates a red flag.

245
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:35,083
It has a binary that could be installed in the system 32 or one of the paths.

246
00:15:35,125 --> 00:15:38,999
So that could be a red flag and get caught it.

247
00:15:38,999 --> 00:15:42,792
Touches disk, sometimes AV doesn't like WEC.

248
00:15:43,417 --> 00:15:46,834
And the reason it took longer to run, obfuscated

249
00:15:46,834 --> 00:15:50,792
the resource DSLs that are in the WCE binary and it takes

250
00:15:50,792 --> 00:15:54,501
an extra couple of seconds but I'm pretty sure that AV

251
00:15:54,501 --> 00:15:57,584
will have a hard time with it.

252
00:15:57,792 --> 00:16:00,751
That's part of what I release.

253
00:16:01,501 --> 00:16:04,999
Authentication over port 139 or 445 is required.

254
00:16:04,999 --> 00:16:06,999
If you can't do that, this doesn't work.

255
00:16:06,999 --> 00:16:08,999
And then locard exchange principles.

256
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:12,167
This touches disk.

257
00:16:12,167 --> 00:16:14,959
It will not stand up to a forensics administration.

258
00:16:16,292 --> 00:16:20,083
The admins will look at the server and think everything is just fine.

259
00:16:20,417 --> 00:16:22,709
It has a lot of log ins.

260
00:16:23,584 --> 00:16:26,083
It might log in three or four times, and that might look bad

261
00:16:26,083 --> 00:16:28,375
if they are looking for that.

262
00:16:29,626 --> 00:16:31,584
So where can I get smbexec?

263
00:16:31,667 --> 00:16:35,083
It's out on sourceforge or git hub under brav0hax.

264
00:16:38,626 --> 00:16:40,999
And Royce creates one.

265
00:16:47,792 --> 00:16:49,709
Impact it looks like they developed something

266
00:16:49,709 --> 00:16:52,626
in python that was developed on Royce's work.

267
00:16:54,417 --> 00:16:55,999
I know bash, I don't know anything else

268
00:16:55,999 --> 00:16:58,626
and I don't really know bash that well.

269
00:16:58,626 --> 00:17:00,999
So a couple of our guys on team ported it to Ruby.

270
00:17:00,999 --> 00:17:07,250
So it's multi threaded and less hiccups and that's Brandon McCann.

271
00:17:10,375 --> 00:17:12,417
So credit where credit is due.

272
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:22,999
Of course, WCE, Herman Ochoa, and smbclient, and winexe,

273
00:17:22,999 --> 00:17:27,459
and Skip Duckwall, you know, the original vanish script.

274
00:17:32,959 --> 00:17:36,292
The samba team, and winexe, and metasploit team, and

275
00:17:36,292 --> 00:17:38,999
the list goes on and on.

276
00:17:38,999 --> 00:17:43,834
Basically I couldn't smbexec really wouldn't work without that.

277
00:17:43,999 --> 00:17:46,375
So I don't know if I have time for questions, but please give

278
00:17:46,375 --> 00:17:49,709
the hackers for charity, go buy a T shirt or something.

279
00:17:53,083 --> 00:17:55,083
Thank you very much.
