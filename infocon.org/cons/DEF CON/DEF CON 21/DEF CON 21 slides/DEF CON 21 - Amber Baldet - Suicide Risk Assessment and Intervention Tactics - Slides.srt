1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,125
AMBER BALDET: I'm Amber Baldet,

2
00:00:02,125 --> 00:00:05,709
and I'm going to be presenting

3
00:00:05,709 --> 00:00:06,999
tactics to you.

4
00:00:07,083 --> 00:00:10,375
I'm going to give a quick intro

5
00:00:10,375 --> 00:00:13,209
at DEF CON

6
00:00:13,209 --> 00:00:18,250
a PT or hacking cars and then we

7
00:00:18,999 --> 00:00:21,999
So first off, I would

8
00:00:21,999 --> 00:00:24,000
dissonance for you.

9
00:00:24,209 --> 00:00:26,999
My main goal here

10
00:00:27,125 --> 00:00:30,334
So trigger warning, this

11
00:00:30,334 --> 00:00:34,375
and mental health and that might be

12
00:00:34,999 --> 00:00:37,292
If you feel uncomfortable in any way,

13
00:00:37,292 --> 00:00:40,918
in the room that have been affected

14
00:00:40,918 --> 00:00:44,501
or have made attempts themselves

15
00:00:44,501 --> 00:00:48,250
If you feel uncomfortable, feel free

16
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:49,876
We won't judge you at all.

17
00:00:49,999 --> 00:00:54,000
So I will be also be speaking a lot

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,417
And that is no way meant to say this

19
00:00:58,417 --> 00:00:59,999
Your experience may vary.

20
00:00:59,999 --> 00:01:01,459
If you want to have

21
00:01:01,459 --> 00:01:04,083
we'll be able to do that after the fact.

22
00:01:04,292 --> 00:01:08,999
So today what we're going to go

23
00:01:08,999 --> 00:01:12,959
We have risk analysis framework which

24
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:17,834
how to identify clues and warning signs

25
00:01:17,834 --> 00:01:21,209
indicate some brewing crisis, how

26
00:01:21,209 --> 00:01:23,375
threat assessment.

27
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:26,083
So this is how

28
00:01:26,083 --> 00:01:29,999
determine how to make

29
00:01:30,083 --> 00:01:32,250
So, if something is low risk,

30
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:36,083
to tackle it differently than someone

31
00:01:36,083 --> 00:01:39,751
to get immediately to some sort

32
00:01:39,751 --> 00:01:42,083
cover volunteer and first responder

33
00:01:42,083 --> 00:01:46,999
is really where my training comes from,

34
00:01:47,083 --> 00:01:49,999
But the main point there

35
00:01:49,999 --> 00:01:52,876
the type of people that

36
00:01:52,876 --> 00:01:55,459
to know how the real people do it.

37
00:01:55,584 --> 00:01:58,834
So I will show you lots and lots

38
00:01:58,834 --> 00:02:01,083
But none of that is required

39
00:02:01,083 --> 00:02:03,959
a successful intervention.

40
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:08,918
There's very few things that are needed

41
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:11,501
Also just listen

42
00:02:11,501 --> 00:02:13,876
out in the community.

43
00:02:14,209 --> 00:02:17,999
This isn't the type of talk you need

44
00:02:17,999 --> 00:02:21,876
or research so you can actually

45
00:02:21,999 --> 00:02:25,584
Although there is that much research

46
00:02:25,584 --> 00:02:26,542
The goal is to make it

47
00:02:26,542 --> 00:02:28,999
and usable immediately as possible.

48
00:02:29,292 --> 00:02:33,209
Also we'll cover how to talk

49
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:36,375
This is an important topic

50
00:02:36,459 --> 00:02:42,209
So active listening, question phrasing,

51
00:02:42,209 --> 00:02:48,999
et cetera: So hopefully we'll pick

52
00:02:48,999 --> 00:02:51,709
Who am I and why am I standing there.

53
00:02:51,709 --> 00:02:53,918
I work

54
00:02:53,918 --> 00:02:55,918
Had is not what I do full time.

55
00:02:56,083 --> 00:02:58,999
Some of what I do involves info sec

56
00:02:58,999 --> 00:03:03,542
Nothing you want to hear me talk

57
00:03:03,542 --> 00:03:07,417
with girls who code must

58
00:03:07,417 --> 00:03:10,709
is QPR institute training.

59
00:03:10,999 --> 00:03:13,626
Question, persuade, refer, that's

60
00:03:13,626 --> 00:03:16,250
they teach autopsy responders.

61
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:17,999
They have a bunch

62
00:03:17,999 --> 00:03:22,459
and I got involved with them

63
00:03:22,459 --> 00:03:24,792
Which is the same thing as you

64
00:03:24,792 --> 00:03:28,792
the numbers we see posted everywhere

65
00:03:30,459 --> 00:03:32,334
I group you on IRC.

66
00:03:32,334 --> 00:03:33,667
and I'm the kind

67
00:03:33,667 --> 00:03:36,083
up the phone and talk

68
00:03:36,999 --> 00:03:38,999
I have no problem throwing my heart

69
00:03:38,999 --> 00:03:40,542
on the Internet.

70
00:03:43,751 --> 00:03:47,709
So we have

71
00:03:47,709 --> 00:03:52,292
more used to reading the cadence

72
00:03:52,292 --> 00:03:56,292
down than maybe other people don't

73
00:03:56,292 --> 00:03:59,292
So we might be stronger responders

74
00:03:59,292 --> 00:04:00,918
So that's why I got involved.

75
00:04:00,918 --> 00:04:01,959
But I ended

76
00:04:01,959 --> 00:04:06,209
with it because it turned out I wanted

77
00:04:06,751 --> 00:04:08,667
Not exclusively but it

78
00:04:08,667 --> 00:04:11,751
in being able to understand and talk

79
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:15,250
It turns out now that everyone has

80
00:04:15,834 --> 00:04:17,999
So they're all on IM.

81
00:04:17,999 --> 00:04:20,584
And the people that contact

82
00:04:20,584 --> 00:04:24,083
from the Internet or from Reddit

83
00:04:24,083 --> 00:04:28,626
They're just regular people so I decided

84
00:04:28,626 --> 00:04:33,125
the skill set and bring it directly

85
00:04:33,125 --> 00:04:36,999
So that we can you know,

86
00:04:36,999 --> 00:04:38,375
I'm going to touch everyone.

87
00:04:38,375 --> 00:04:39,375
No.

88
00:04:39,375 --> 00:04:40,375
In that sort of way.

89
00:04:40,375 --> 00:04:41,375
Whew!

90
00:04:41,375 --> 00:04:43,834
If we good get everybody here

91
00:04:43,834 --> 00:04:48,918
they can then tell somebody,

92
00:04:48,918 --> 00:04:50,999
And it's the kind of thing you can do

93
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:52,999
And people find suicide fascinating.

94
00:04:52,999 --> 00:04:57,876
It's that morbid idea to learn

95
00:04:58,167 --> 00:05:01,083
So it's actually really easy knowledge

96
00:05:02,542 --> 00:05:08,459
I can't give you the official

97
00:05:08,459 --> 00:05:14,751
theory, the basic course

98
00:05:14,751 --> 00:05:17,292
So I had to make a title for DEF CON.

99
00:05:17,292 --> 00:05:19,876
So, if you want your certification.

100
00:05:28,167 --> 00:05:32,876
Every time I freaked

101
00:05:32,876 --> 00:05:37,083
to shut up and do it and thank you

102
00:05:37,083 --> 00:05:41,876
of them are here (Applause.) So how

103
00:05:42,083 --> 00:05:45,083
This is the most depressing slide

104
00:05:45,083 --> 00:05:46,334
I have a unicorn chaser.

105
00:05:46,999 --> 00:05:49,959
There were two suicides

106
00:05:49,959 --> 00:05:52,125
up that affected me.

107
00:05:52,626 --> 00:05:56,918
I come from a family of brilliant artists,

108
00:05:56,918 --> 00:06:01,999
out these people are prone

109
00:06:02,501 --> 00:06:06,999
So, when my mother was diagnosed

110
00:06:06,999 --> 00:06:10,751
she was going to follow the same path.

111
00:06:10,999 --> 00:06:12,876
So I kind of took the nerd

112
00:06:12,876 --> 00:06:16,167
to learn everything I possibly could

113
00:06:16,167 --> 00:06:18,125
And that's how I ended up volunteering.

114
00:06:18,125 --> 00:06:20,584
And why I'm here and she's fine now,

115
00:06:20,584 --> 00:06:21,667
Thanks, mom.

116
00:06:26,083 --> 00:06:29,751
Right around the time I was doing this

117
00:06:29,751 --> 00:06:33,542
the Aaron Swartz situation happened

118
00:06:33,792 --> 00:06:36,250
If you're from the previous track,

119
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:39,584
of Aaron's suicide earlier this year.

120
00:06:39,876 --> 00:06:43,250
And what surprised me was that

121
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:45,999
people in the community who reached

122
00:06:45,999 --> 00:06:48,999
they were worried about their friends.

123
00:06:48,999 --> 00:06:51,375
They don't know what to do,

124
00:06:51,375 --> 00:06:53,999
and wanted resources

125
00:06:53,999 --> 00:06:56,083
of red flags for me.

126
00:06:58,292 --> 00:07:02,959
Contagion is a very well known effect

127
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:04,459
When someone high profile dies.

128
00:07:04,459 --> 00:07:08,999
So it's actually based it's called

129
00:07:08,999 --> 00:07:13,584
on a book

130
00:07:13,999 --> 00:07:18,292
It detailed a suicide at a writing desk

131
00:07:18,292 --> 00:07:20,999
it that they banned the book.

132
00:07:21,417 --> 00:07:23,959
You see this in clusters

133
00:07:25,292 --> 00:07:30,125
The Godzilla is Mount Mihara which

134
00:07:30,125 --> 00:07:34,999
in to trap him is based

135
00:07:34,999 --> 00:07:40,250
has been presence of hundreds

136
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:42,918
So San Francisco

137
00:07:42,918 --> 00:07:46,375
familiar with our cultural attachment

138
00:07:46,375 --> 00:07:52,626
So we're doing it wrong when it comes

139
00:07:52,876 --> 00:07:56,542
There are standards which I've taken

140
00:07:56,542 --> 00:07:59,999
to social media published

141
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:03,542
of encourage you

142
00:08:03,542 --> 00:08:07,626
whether it's in our community or not,

143
00:08:07,626 --> 00:08:10,459
they don't quite get right.

144
00:08:10,999 --> 00:08:13,375
We want

145
00:08:13,375 --> 00:08:17,459
suicide is never the result

146
00:08:17,918 --> 00:08:21,584
There might have been a trigger,

147
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:26,959
into a crisis situation, but don't wake

148
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:28,083
That's not what happens.

149
00:08:28,083 --> 00:08:32,417
If you look at the first bullet point there,

150
00:08:32,417 --> 00:08:34,584
and slashed out.

151
00:08:34,626 --> 00:08:36,626
That's because it would be great

152
00:08:36,626 --> 00:08:40,083
if all of us could stop saying committed

153
00:08:40,209 --> 00:08:43,250
That is not clinically accurate.

154
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:45,250
It's a throwback

155
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:48,375
which does not exist in a majority

156
00:08:49,834 --> 00:08:55,083
And people say clinically died

157
00:08:55,083 --> 00:08:57,834
Killed themselves, a whole variety

158
00:08:57,834 --> 00:09:01,542
other words you can use that don't

159
00:09:01,542 --> 00:09:04,542
and don't refer

160
00:09:04,542 --> 00:09:06,125
don't need.

161
00:09:06,125 --> 00:09:09,999
We also want to point out that suicide

162
00:09:09,999 --> 00:09:12,250
long history of problems.

163
00:09:12,999 --> 00:09:18,334
Generally not making it seem

164
00:09:18,334 --> 00:09:24,292
I guess Maybe we could do that

165
00:09:24,292 --> 00:09:26,417
So it's not just Aaron.

166
00:09:27,334 --> 00:09:30,501
These are computer science suicides

167
00:09:30,501 --> 00:09:34,626
of course would be when we would see

168
00:09:34,626 --> 00:09:37,751
And before that,

169
00:09:37,751 --> 00:09:39,751
We're probably a lot more familiar

170
00:09:39,751 --> 00:09:43,959
because they tends

171
00:09:44,999 --> 00:09:49,584
It's prevalent in the highly gifted

172
00:09:49,999 --> 00:09:51,751
That said, the vast majority

173
00:09:51,751 --> 00:09:54,542
by suicide don't have Wikipedia pages.

174
00:09:54,584 --> 00:09:56,959
So while it's nice

175
00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:00,626
in our research, really this

176
00:10:00,626 --> 00:10:03,042
across every demographic.

177
00:10:03,751 --> 00:10:05,667
I will say though that you probably

178
00:10:05,667 --> 00:10:07,667
a Nobel prize for chemistry.

179
00:10:09,542 --> 00:10:12,999
(Laughter) So I'm just going

180
00:10:12,999 --> 00:10:14,042
And then we're going to leave

181
00:10:14,042 --> 00:10:15,959
of the presentation.

182
00:10:15,959 --> 00:10:19,959
So in America someone dies

183
00:10:19,999 --> 00:10:22,501
In China it's every two minutes.

184
00:10:23,999 --> 00:10:26,459
Overall we're talking

185
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:28,709
death in the United States.

186
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:35,501
That's way ahead of homicide, cancers,

187
00:10:35,918 --> 00:10:38,792
And most critically for us and not

188
00:10:38,792 --> 00:10:43,375
but just briefly you're demographically

189
00:10:43,667 --> 00:10:44,999
We can do this by a show of.

190
00:10:44,999 --> 00:10:45,999
Hands.

191
00:10:45,999 --> 00:10:49,542
How many men fall between 15 and 24?

192
00:10:51,751 --> 00:10:57,999
For you guys, this

193
00:10:58,334 --> 00:11:00,918
Behind accidents and homicide.

194
00:11:01,209 --> 00:11:03,542
How about 25 and 34.

195
00:11:04,083 --> 00:11:06,292
Hey, that's almost all of you.

196
00:11:07,834 --> 00:11:09,709
It's second for you.

197
00:11:10,999 --> 00:11:15,334
Second only to accidental death

198
00:11:16,083 --> 00:11:19,167
If you look at 45 54 bracket,

199
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:22,083
but we start to lose people

200
00:11:22,083 --> 00:11:24,083
the data that way.

201
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:25,501
Skews the data that way.

202
00:11:27,375 --> 00:11:29,959
Twice the number of homicides

203
00:11:29,959 --> 00:11:33,083
More than half

204
00:11:34,125 --> 00:11:36,626
Women are three times as likely

205
00:11:36,626 --> 00:11:39,792
by men are four times as likely to die

206
00:11:39,876 --> 00:11:47,417
That largely has to do not

207
00:11:47,584 --> 00:11:52,999
That's you choose pills which you think

208
00:11:52,999 --> 00:11:56,250
men tend

209
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:58,999
have high lethality.

210
00:11:59,959 --> 00:12:01,083
So goodness.

211
00:12:01,083 --> 00:12:03,209
You're going to make me drink,

212
00:12:03,209 --> 00:12:04,375
(Applause) All right.

213
00:12:04,375 --> 00:12:15,083
Can I borrow the microphone

214
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:17,834
You know the drill.

215
00:12:17,834 --> 00:12:20,250
We have a tradition we decided

216
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:23,125
up somebody from the audience.

217
00:12:23,125 --> 00:12:26,083
But we need somebody who

218
00:12:29,334 --> 00:12:31,542
I like you.

219
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:34,999
You have to answer trivia question.

220
00:12:35,209 --> 00:12:37,792
Do you know

221
00:12:39,083 --> 00:12:40,834
Excellent,

222
00:12:40,834 --> 00:12:42,125
at DEF CON.

223
00:12:42,125 --> 00:12:43,125
Come on up.

224
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:53,959
AMBER BALDET: I'm taking this

225
00:13:00,834 --> 00:13:02,292
Your time is up now.

226
00:13:02,417 --> 00:13:07,834
How is it going so far?

227
00:13:07,834 --> 00:13:08,834
She doing okay?

228
00:13:08,834 --> 00:13:09,834
(Applause).

229
00:13:09,834 --> 00:13:10,834
All right.

230
00:13:28,792 --> 00:13:31,167
Now let's talk about clinical things.

231
00:13:33,834 --> 00:13:36,334
I'm segue independent.

232
00:13:36,999 --> 00:13:38,250
So all right.

233
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:40,999
We're going to skip over most

234
00:13:40,999 --> 00:13:44,751
I want to make you aware that this talk

235
00:13:44,751 --> 00:13:49,626
of diagnosis that I would be remiss not

236
00:13:49,626 --> 00:13:55,083
of diagnosis here I'm sure we're aware

237
00:13:55,083 --> 00:13:57,167
at the bottom.

238
00:13:58,584 --> 00:14:02,959
Harm reduction is great

239
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:04,999
Sobriety is very heavily indicated

240
00:14:04,999 --> 00:14:07,876
of mental health management program.

241
00:14:07,999 --> 00:14:10,918
That's because harm reduction works

242
00:14:10,918 --> 00:14:12,999
but you accidentally die.

243
00:14:13,209 --> 00:14:16,209
So, if death is your end game,

244
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:17,999
We won't go

245
00:14:17,999 --> 00:14:22,375
but most importantly pay attention

246
00:14:22,375 --> 00:14:23,626
They're most common.

247
00:14:23,626 --> 00:14:25,834
If you look

248
00:14:25,834 --> 00:14:29,999
this kind of outlines the number

249
00:14:29,999 --> 00:14:34,125
if you're classified within one

250
00:14:34,125 --> 00:14:39,250
that your chance or your likelihood

251
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:40,918
So obviously,

252
00:14:40,918 --> 00:14:42,626
of off the charts.

253
00:14:42,918 --> 00:14:43,918
But also, depression,

254
00:14:43,918 --> 00:14:46,125
all of these are heavily indicated.

255
00:14:46,125 --> 00:14:47,626
Of what you might not see on there

256
00:14:47,626 --> 00:14:49,751
at the bottom that I added

257
00:14:49,751 --> 00:14:52,626
is all these other medical illnesses.

258
00:14:52,626 --> 00:14:54,999
People think there's

259
00:14:54,999 --> 00:14:59,167
who are medically ill are more likely

260
00:14:59,167 --> 00:15:00,918
It's very small.

261
00:15:00,918 --> 00:15:04,083
Not statistically relevant and autism

262
00:15:04,334 --> 00:15:05,584
Okay.

263
00:15:05,876 --> 00:15:08,417
So within our community,

264
00:15:08,417 --> 00:15:13,959
in our community but everywhere

265
00:15:13,959 --> 00:15:15,999
So within our community, I kind

266
00:15:15,999 --> 00:15:19,083
of a few archetypes

267
00:15:19,083 --> 00:15:21,876
about it that might happen.

268
00:15:21,876 --> 00:15:23,083
So I'll sleep when I'm dead.

269
00:15:23,083 --> 00:15:24,417
I'm too busy crushing it.

270
00:15:24,459 --> 00:15:26,999
This to me typifies

271
00:15:26,999 --> 00:15:30,250
They have something called "the

272
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:33,792
And that's that basically mania

273
00:15:33,792 --> 00:15:35,083
Depression is stigmatized.

274
00:15:35,083 --> 00:15:37,334
There's youth and burnout.

275
00:15:37,667 --> 00:15:39,334
Chronically underinsured.

276
00:15:39,417 --> 00:15:41,375
Drug use is trivialized.

277
00:15:41,918 --> 00:15:46,501
There's overlap

278
00:15:46,999 --> 00:15:49,999
That might match what, you know.

279
00:15:49,999 --> 00:15:53,292
that's a witch's brew

280
00:15:54,667 --> 00:15:57,834
Just because I'm paranoid doesn't

281
00:15:58,918 --> 00:16:01,999
Sounds like underdiagnosis

282
00:16:02,167 --> 00:16:06,792
If you look at this in regular population,

283
00:16:06,792 --> 00:16:09,584
to find

284
00:16:09,584 --> 00:16:13,959
if you work in some

285
00:16:13,959 --> 00:16:15,626
They don't really understand you.

286
00:16:15,626 --> 00:16:18,417
They don't understand

287
00:16:18,417 --> 00:16:20,918
And they might not be able

288
00:16:20,918 --> 00:16:23,501
what is actually an acceptable level

289
00:16:23,501 --> 00:16:26,709
for the things that you're involved in.

290
00:16:28,125 --> 00:16:31,709
You might also be more likely open

291
00:16:31,709 --> 00:16:33,999
which can be a problem.

292
00:16:33,999 --> 00:16:37,542
So, if you want to learn more

293
00:16:37,542 --> 00:16:41,709
these are some

294
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:46,417
if you are a heavily creative type,

295
00:16:46,417 --> 00:16:51,542
about manic depression in artists

296
00:16:51,542 --> 00:16:55,999
a good thing, touched by fire

297
00:16:56,375 --> 00:16:58,999
All of this stuff is on the CDs

298
00:16:58,999 --> 00:17:04,083
So for us, if we self diagnose,

299
00:17:04,083 --> 00:17:07,918
Ph.D.s in psychology

300
00:17:07,918 --> 00:17:11,999
and we go online, we tend

301
00:17:11,999 --> 00:17:15,999
of like we'll post a forum post

302
00:17:15,999 --> 00:17:19,999
but not we don't have one

303
00:17:19,999 --> 00:17:22,667
to get away from that.

304
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:26,626
So this is the online intervention that

305
00:17:27,125 --> 00:17:30,459
30% of college

306
00:17:30,459 --> 00:17:33,501
We get a lot higher retention rate

307
00:17:33,501 --> 00:17:37,959
It's more anonymous

308
00:17:38,083 --> 00:17:40,542
Mostly they don't track you just

309
00:17:40,542 --> 00:17:43,999
because they really don't know how

310
00:17:44,999 --> 00:17:48,626
Kind of hinders their ability

311
00:17:49,083 --> 00:17:53,083
Efficacy is equivalent with hotline.

312
00:17:53,584 --> 00:17:54,834
Training is great.

313
00:17:55,083 --> 00:17:56,083
Good resource.

314
00:17:56,083 --> 00:17:59,250
But like I mentioned earlier your pairing

315
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:00,709
So we're bringing it to you.

316
00:18:00,709 --> 00:18:04,167
Now what's the difference

317
00:18:04,167 --> 00:18:10,167
like to fall a friendtervention,

318
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:14,999
The person comes to you,

319
00:18:14,999 --> 00:18:17,999
they want to tell you their problems.

320
00:18:18,209 --> 00:18:22,334
They assume that you know what

321
00:18:22,834 --> 00:18:24,792
There's enforced anonymity,

322
00:18:24,792 --> 00:18:28,083
to give them your name or have

323
00:18:30,999 --> 00:18:33,584
In a friendtervention you may need

324
00:18:33,584 --> 00:18:35,959
and that can harm your friendship.

325
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:40,959
Maybe you start to lose credibility.

326
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:44,999
The ultimate end game is not

327
00:18:44,999 --> 00:18:47,918
unless you want

328
00:18:48,083 --> 00:18:51,375
No, you want to get them

329
00:18:51,375 --> 00:18:52,999
So we need to get people

330
00:18:52,999 --> 00:18:56,751
through really accepting professional

331
00:18:56,751 --> 00:18:57,999
It's very hard

332
00:18:57,999 --> 00:19:00,459
because a lot

333
00:19:00,459 --> 00:19:03,751
in the past with people that didn't

334
00:19:03,751 --> 00:19:05,250
didn't work.

335
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:08,292
The medication

336
00:19:08,292 --> 00:19:11,999
a lot better, 60 80%

337
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:15,999
you find the right therapy it

338
00:19:15,999 --> 00:19:19,626
down and you have to trust

339
00:19:19,626 --> 00:19:21,792
of work yourself.

340
00:19:21,999 --> 00:19:23,209
So we need

341
00:19:23,209 --> 00:19:25,709
to seek help

342
00:19:25,709 --> 00:19:28,751
and responding

343
00:19:28,751 --> 00:19:31,918
How are we going to identify risks?

344
00:19:31,918 --> 00:19:34,292
There's a few clues you want

345
00:19:34,459 --> 00:19:39,334
Direct verbal cues, this

346
00:19:39,417 --> 00:19:43,083
If I don't get a boyfriend soon,

347
00:19:43,709 --> 00:19:47,125
Obvious, often encoded as jokes.

348
00:19:47,417 --> 00:19:49,250
Keep your eyes out for that.

349
00:19:49,459 --> 00:19:51,834
Indirect, I'm tired of life,

350
00:19:51,834 --> 00:19:53,999
off without me,

351
00:19:53,999 --> 00:19:55,918
to worry about me.

352
00:19:55,918 --> 00:19:58,501
These are big red flags

353
00:19:58,501 --> 00:20:01,584
throw out there to see

354
00:20:01,584 --> 00:20:02,999
to them.

355
00:20:03,209 --> 00:20:04,459
Behavioral.

356
00:20:04,459 --> 00:20:06,000
Maybe they just seem depressed.

357
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,375
That's kind of important.

358
00:20:07,375 --> 00:20:11,667
If they get their affairs in order,

359
00:20:11,667 --> 00:20:16,999
if they were into drugs or alcohol

360
00:20:16,999 --> 00:20:18,959
huge red flag.

361
00:20:22,999 --> 00:20:24,999
Situationally trigger events.

362
00:20:25,167 --> 00:20:28,375
Lose a job or relationship you're

363
00:20:28,375 --> 00:20:32,000
you're suddenly being prosecuted

364
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,999
these things are huge,

365
00:20:36,584 --> 00:20:40,334
So you want to watch for red flags

366
00:20:40,876 --> 00:20:44,250
So take them all seriously

367
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:47,000
If somebody is talking about suicide,

368
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Not true.

369
00:20:48,834 --> 00:20:50,999
If you're talking to someone

370
00:20:50,999 --> 00:20:53,083
to put the idea in their head,

371
00:20:53,083 --> 00:20:55,876
if you're that worried about your friend,

372
00:20:55,876 --> 00:20:57,542
about it themselves.

373
00:20:58,626 --> 00:21:00,167
Seize the day.

374
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:04,167
This is a big wall of text,

375
00:21:04,999 --> 00:21:07,542
But it's to take away

376
00:21:07,542 --> 00:21:11,083
is how you form

377
00:21:11,083 --> 00:21:13,876
This is something you carry

378
00:21:13,959 --> 00:21:15,959
So it doesn't really change day to day.

379
00:21:15,959 --> 00:21:17,083
It's about who you are and

380
00:21:17,083 --> 00:21:19,250
of bag you've picked up.

381
00:21:19,542 --> 00:21:21,751
Some of it might be changeable

382
00:21:21,751 --> 00:21:23,125
at the bottom.

383
00:21:23,459 --> 00:21:24,999
So maybe you moved

384
00:21:24,999 --> 00:21:29,167
the sociopolitical climate

385
00:21:29,459 --> 00:21:31,250
That might lower your risk.

386
00:21:35,167 --> 00:21:37,250
One time I called this the lint

387
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:40,959
of life and people enjoyed that so I go

388
00:21:40,959 --> 00:21:44,584
These are things you cannot get

389
00:21:44,584 --> 00:21:46,834
to cope with them.

390
00:21:46,999 --> 00:21:49,999
And then biologically, this

391
00:21:49,999 --> 00:21:51,334
you are.

392
00:21:51,834 --> 00:21:55,459
So this would be your mental illnesses,

393
00:21:55,459 --> 00:21:57,999
That's the foundation

394
00:21:57,999 --> 00:21:59,834
proximal risks.

395
00:21:59,834 --> 00:22:00,709
So these are

396
00:22:00,709 --> 00:22:02,209
about before.

397
00:22:02,209 --> 00:22:04,083
This is the stuff that

398
00:22:04,083 --> 00:22:07,292
they will say is why you killed yourself.

399
00:22:07,292 --> 00:22:10,501
So it's a relationship crisis,

400
00:22:10,501 --> 00:22:11,999
It's losing money.

401
00:22:11,999 --> 00:22:14,999
It's whatever the event

402
00:22:14,999 --> 00:22:19,626
But what's most important

403
00:22:19,709 --> 00:22:24,999
It's your perceived level of loss,

404
00:22:24,999 --> 00:22:27,999
And one interesting note

405
00:22:27,999 --> 00:22:32,876
is any sort of risk or protective factor

406
00:22:33,083 --> 00:22:34,999
Absolutely irrelevant.

407
00:22:35,375 --> 00:22:40,999
A relative loss of financial stability

408
00:22:40,999 --> 00:22:42,918
But having a lot of money does not

409
00:22:42,918 --> 00:22:44,876
against suicide risk.

410
00:22:45,083 --> 00:22:47,999
So as we move across the way,

411
00:22:47,999 --> 00:22:49,834
of hopelessness which

412
00:22:49,834 --> 00:22:52,999
the one thing we really want to try

413
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:56,751
We're trying to provide hope

414
00:22:56,751 --> 00:22:58,334
That's the most important thing.

415
00:22:58,334 --> 00:23:01,542
And then you have a wall of resistance,

416
00:23:01,542 --> 00:23:04,083
pushing back, keeping you safe.

417
00:23:04,083 --> 00:23:08,751
Once that's broken through,

418
00:23:09,083 --> 00:23:12,125
So the resistance,

419
00:23:12,125 --> 00:23:16,083
are pretty obvious, these are

420
00:23:16,083 --> 00:23:20,999
we want to have all these things, again,

421
00:23:20,999 --> 00:23:24,918
there's a few like the AA sponsor

422
00:23:24,918 --> 00:23:28,083
of a meal mental health plan that

423
00:23:28,083 --> 00:23:32,459
but positive therapeutic relationship

424
00:23:32,459 --> 00:23:35,167
but you do want to check them

425
00:23:35,167 --> 00:23:39,125
to people mentally and know

426
00:23:39,125 --> 00:23:42,667
or whether they have somebody

427
00:23:43,292 --> 00:23:45,751
Oh, my God,

428
00:23:45,751 --> 00:23:47,334
be suicidal.

429
00:23:47,417 --> 00:23:49,083
Here's the process.

430
00:23:49,083 --> 00:23:50,709
You find a safe place to talk.

431
00:23:51,417 --> 00:23:52,999
Set aside time.

432
00:23:52,999 --> 00:23:55,292
Best face to face but it doesn't have

433
00:23:55,542 --> 00:23:56,999
You build rapport and trust.

434
00:23:56,999 --> 00:23:58,959
That's the talking to a human thing.

435
00:23:59,083 --> 00:24:00,626
We'll cover that in a second.

436
00:24:00,709 --> 00:24:02,999
You're going to ask

437
00:24:02,999 --> 00:24:07,751
This is the most critical step

438
00:24:07,751 --> 00:24:11,999
someone if they are thinking about,

439
00:24:11,999 --> 00:24:14,918
are you feeling suicidal?

440
00:24:15,501 --> 00:24:20,626
It's very important to ask this

441
00:24:20,876 --> 00:24:22,999
You can kind of roundabout it

442
00:24:22,999 --> 00:24:27,501
about not waking up" you don't want

443
00:24:27,501 --> 00:24:30,792
We'll talk about different ways

444
00:24:30,959 --> 00:24:33,999
This is the hardest step and

445
00:24:33,999 --> 00:24:35,999
the most lives.

446
00:24:35,999 --> 00:24:38,584
People are just waiting for someone

447
00:24:38,918 --> 00:24:40,999
So once you ask the question

448
00:24:40,999 --> 00:24:44,250
you just shut up and listen

449
00:24:44,709 --> 00:24:47,542
While you're listening,

450
00:24:47,542 --> 00:24:51,375
of their current situation based

451
00:24:51,375 --> 00:24:53,375
in a second here.

452
00:24:53,876 --> 00:24:56,751
And you're doing active listening.

453
00:24:56,751 --> 00:24:57,999
So you're responding

454
00:24:57,999 --> 00:25:00,999
you're asking relevant questions,

455
00:25:00,999 --> 00:25:03,834
around things that you want to know.

456
00:25:03,834 --> 00:25:06,999
But mostly just giving them space

457
00:25:06,999 --> 00:25:08,999
And throughout that kind

458
00:25:08,999 --> 00:25:11,334
you are determining

459
00:25:11,334 --> 00:25:15,334
moderate risk, super high risk,

460
00:25:15,375 --> 00:25:18,626
And then once you've determined

461
00:25:18,626 --> 00:25:21,999
to implement

462
00:25:23,083 --> 00:25:25,834
Most importantly or usually we want

463
00:25:25,834 --> 00:25:27,709
like I mentioned before.

464
00:25:27,709 --> 00:25:30,918
You don't want to stop

465
00:25:30,918 --> 00:25:32,959
You want

466
00:25:32,959 --> 00:25:37,083
on treatment and that

467
00:25:37,083 --> 00:25:38,709
And then you want to follow up.

468
00:25:38,709 --> 00:25:40,626
You don't want them to feel abandoned.

469
00:25:40,626 --> 00:25:41,459
You want to check

470
00:25:41,459 --> 00:25:43,876
is there and somebody cares.

471
00:25:43,999 --> 00:25:48,584
Often people feel so crushingly alone

472
00:25:48,584 --> 00:25:51,999
brighten their day and change their

473
00:25:52,501 --> 00:25:55,501
I usually asked this question so I throw

474
00:25:56,459 --> 00:26:00,792
What are my reporting obligations

475
00:26:00,999 --> 00:26:02,083
Basically none.

476
00:26:04,125 --> 00:26:07,999
Unless you're getting paid

477
00:26:08,167 --> 00:26:10,083
If you're a teacher, social worker,

478
00:26:10,083 --> 00:26:14,542
there are other obligations you'd know

479
00:26:14,667 --> 00:26:18,250
But as a Good Samaritan,

480
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:20,209
you'll be fine.

481
00:26:23,999 --> 00:26:26,334
Reverse

482
00:26:26,334 --> 00:26:30,626
and somebody storms out and says

483
00:26:30,626 --> 00:26:34,083
Z or whatever I'll kill myself,

484
00:26:34,083 --> 00:26:37,709
to see them and and they go

485
00:26:37,709 --> 00:26:40,167
or responsible in some way?

486
00:26:40,167 --> 00:26:41,999
The answer is no, absolutely not.

487
00:26:41,999 --> 00:26:43,667
You had nothing to do with it.

488
00:26:43,667 --> 00:26:44,918
You can't control them.

489
00:26:44,999 --> 00:26:49,626
There's usually lots of survivor guilt

490
00:26:49,999 --> 00:26:52,999
But you don't have an obligation

491
00:26:52,999 --> 00:26:56,083
If you know what to do, it's great

492
00:26:56,083 --> 00:26:57,999
to talk about.

493
00:26:57,999 --> 00:27:03,792
But it's most important that you get

494
00:27:03,792 --> 00:27:08,250
and do it and activate

495
00:27:08,250 --> 00:27:13,250
is Uma Thurman's do you listen

496
00:27:13,501 --> 00:27:15,083
Or Vincent Vega's response.

497
00:27:18,125 --> 00:27:20,834
That's how I explain active listening.

498
00:27:21,083 --> 00:27:23,292
It's not from the still.

499
00:27:23,292 --> 00:27:26,667
It's from the director's cut,

500
00:27:27,417 --> 00:27:29,083
It's the important things.

501
00:27:29,501 --> 00:27:32,667
So building rapport,

502
00:27:32,999 --> 00:27:35,334
Ask one question at a time.

503
00:27:35,334 --> 00:27:37,125
Give the person time to respond.

504
00:27:37,334 --> 00:27:39,876
This is a little counterintuitive.

505
00:27:39,876 --> 00:27:41,667
But, if you repeat back

506
00:27:41,667 --> 00:27:44,626
it makes them feel understood

507
00:27:44,626 --> 00:27:49,459
People in an acute suicidal state

508
00:27:49,459 --> 00:27:52,542
they have blinders on.

509
00:27:53,959 --> 00:27:56,834
Research has been done

510
00:27:56,834 --> 00:28:01,501
or various cognitive skill tests that you

511
00:28:01,501 --> 00:28:05,292
You can't see a variety of options

512
00:28:05,292 --> 00:28:08,292
So your thinking is impaired

513
00:28:08,292 --> 00:28:11,792
there's one way

514
00:28:11,792 --> 00:28:16,792
So it's important to get people

515
00:28:16,792 --> 00:28:22,542
it's like this now

516
00:28:22,542 --> 00:28:23,999
Tell me how you feel.

517
00:28:24,792 --> 00:28:28,709
Let me show you that I understand what

518
00:28:28,709 --> 00:28:31,667
So say when you don't understand,

519
00:28:31,667 --> 00:28:33,083
you don't.

520
00:28:33,083 --> 00:28:34,959
They catch on to that very quickly.

521
00:28:35,125 --> 00:28:37,792
And ask open ended questions,

522
00:28:37,876 --> 00:28:40,999
So obviously the opposite

523
00:28:40,999 --> 00:28:43,501
Active listening

524
00:28:43,501 --> 00:28:45,459
That's the takeaway from this.

525
00:28:45,459 --> 00:28:47,584
Yes, you may be filling

526
00:28:47,584 --> 00:28:50,501
or thinking about what they say.

527
00:28:50,999 --> 00:28:53,334
That's what people do all the time.

528
00:28:53,876 --> 00:28:56,792
You're not manipulating an outcome.

529
00:28:57,709 --> 00:29:01,999
And most importantly

530
00:29:01,999 --> 00:29:06,999
to form cognitive functions,

531
00:29:06,999 --> 00:29:12,792
arguments that you can step them

532
00:29:12,999 --> 00:29:15,083
People do not respond

533
00:29:15,083 --> 00:29:17,125
in that sort of state.

534
00:29:17,125 --> 00:29:19,751
What you want to do is create

535
00:29:19,751 --> 00:29:21,876
they can get through a crisis

536
00:29:21,876 --> 00:29:25,167
will eventually end where

537
00:29:25,167 --> 00:29:28,209
and they kind of get back

538
00:29:28,209 --> 00:29:31,292
almost like if you're

539
00:29:31,292 --> 00:29:34,709
drinking and you can't talk

540
00:29:34,709 --> 00:29:36,584
You have to get them

541
00:29:36,584 --> 00:29:38,709
confront their problem.

542
00:29:38,709 --> 00:29:42,292
You can use cognitive behavioral

543
00:29:42,292 --> 00:29:45,834
of the industry

544
00:29:45,834 --> 00:29:48,709
and change their world view.

545
00:29:48,709 --> 00:29:49,999
But you're not going to be able

546
00:29:49,999 --> 00:29:52,083
is in the middle of a crisis.

547
00:29:52,375 --> 00:29:53,667
Okay.

548
00:29:53,918 --> 00:29:56,876
So separating feelings from states

549
00:29:56,876 --> 00:29:57,876
This is actually a great slide

550
00:29:57,876 --> 00:30:00,751
is something you can do on yourself

551
00:30:00,999 --> 00:30:03,959
That you might not it's one

552
00:30:03,959 --> 00:30:06,959
about you hear yourself say but,

553
00:30:06,959 --> 00:30:09,999
it can actually start to change

554
00:30:09,999 --> 00:30:11,501
the world.

555
00:30:11,501 --> 00:30:14,000
So stop saying you are so many things.

556
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,375
I am lonely.

557
00:30:15,626 --> 00:30:17,542
I am a mess.

558
00:30:17,542 --> 00:30:19,292
I am angry.

559
00:30:19,584 --> 00:30:22,542
Like it's a sense

560
00:30:22,542 --> 00:30:24,584
and who you are.

561
00:30:24,709 --> 00:30:26,999
When you introduce someone,

562
00:30:26,999 --> 00:30:31,125
is the worst possible word

563
00:30:31,292 --> 00:30:32,584
They are smart.

564
00:30:32,584 --> 00:30:35,250
It means you accept this person

565
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:36,918
to change.

566
00:30:36,918 --> 00:30:38,626
So, if you change that

567
00:30:38,626 --> 00:30:42,125
but I could change that it might change

568
00:30:42,209 --> 00:30:43,667
This gives you wiggle room

569
00:30:43,667 --> 00:30:46,167
the way you think about things.

570
00:30:46,167 --> 00:30:47,292
So it's a good tactic.

571
00:30:47,292 --> 00:30:52,999
This slide is a slight deviation

572
00:30:52,999 --> 00:30:56,876
But I just wanted to point out this

573
00:30:56,876 --> 00:30:59,999
I'm so burned out.

574
00:30:59,999 --> 00:31:02,999
And it's another thing that really means

575
00:31:03,417 --> 00:31:06,999
It's euphemistic and we all use it

576
00:31:06,999 --> 00:31:09,959
I don't want to deal with it.

577
00:31:09,959 --> 00:31:10,959
But you don't know.

578
00:31:10,959 --> 00:31:11,999
It could mean anything.

579
00:31:11,999 --> 00:31:14,125
So I called the beer therapy

580
00:31:14,125 --> 00:31:17,751
a couple beers with people

581
00:31:17,751 --> 00:31:20,292
out the "I'm so burned out."

582
00:31:20,292 --> 00:31:20,999
And you talk

583
00:31:20,999 --> 00:31:23,584
important than employer and everybody

584
00:31:25,918 --> 00:31:30,417
If you dig down into that a little bit,

585
00:31:30,417 --> 00:31:32,250
all the time.

586
00:31:32,999 --> 00:31:36,626
Get somebody to express anger

587
00:31:36,626 --> 00:31:37,999
Now that's more relevant.

588
00:31:37,999 --> 00:31:40,584
If you can get under that and find

589
00:31:40,584 --> 00:31:44,375
of that's making them feel that way,

590
00:31:44,375 --> 00:31:46,417
and get them

591
00:31:46,417 --> 00:31:49,375
will make them feel less burned out.

592
00:31:49,375 --> 00:31:51,834
So you can probably read this one later

593
00:31:51,834 --> 00:31:54,125
of extracting that information.

594
00:31:54,292 --> 00:31:57,083
So bringing it

595
00:31:57,083 --> 00:32:02,250
S question that I mentioned earlier why,

596
00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:06,501
you're talking to your friend

597
00:32:06,959 --> 00:32:11,209
You've assessed that they are at risk,

598
00:32:11,209 --> 00:32:12,626
You think they trust you.

599
00:32:12,626 --> 00:32:14,125
And now you're ready to ask.

600
00:32:14,125 --> 00:32:15,999
So you can ask directly.

601
00:32:16,584 --> 00:32:19,999
Some of the things that you said made

602
00:32:19,999 --> 00:32:21,626
about suicide.

603
00:32:21,626 --> 00:32:22,626
Am I right?

604
00:32:22,876 --> 00:32:25,209
This is probably one

605
00:32:25,209 --> 00:32:28,083
but you can figure it out for yourself.

606
00:32:29,125 --> 00:32:31,834
Indirectly, have you ever wished that

607
00:32:31,834 --> 00:32:33,709
with all this any more?

608
00:32:33,999 --> 00:32:36,459
The point is you can actually practice

609
00:32:36,459 --> 00:32:39,292
a statement that feels good for you.

610
00:32:39,501 --> 00:32:42,751
It's really weird how difficult it

611
00:32:42,751 --> 00:32:45,459
without it catching in your throat.

612
00:32:45,459 --> 00:32:47,999
It's like when you first start talking

613
00:32:47,999 --> 00:32:52,083
to ask someone about contraception

614
00:32:52,083 --> 00:32:55,626
Like you might be able to just talk

615
00:32:55,626 --> 00:32:58,459
or other settings,

616
00:32:58,459 --> 00:33:03,083
and ask them a vulnerable question

617
00:33:03,584 --> 00:33:06,209
You have to suck it up and do it and

618
00:33:06,209 --> 00:33:09,292
about somebody, you need

619
00:33:11,667 --> 00:33:15,083
Don't say this

620
00:33:15,083 --> 00:33:16,918
Everything else there's not

621
00:33:16,918 --> 00:33:18,751
people are concerned

622
00:33:18,751 --> 00:33:21,083
like you're going to say

623
00:33:21,083 --> 00:33:22,834
over the edge.

624
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:23,999
Don't worry about that.

625
00:33:23,999 --> 00:33:28,459
But don't say you're not thinking

626
00:33:28,834 --> 00:33:30,792
This is the worst.

627
00:33:31,083 --> 00:33:33,459
First of all, you've delegitimized

628
00:33:33,459 --> 00:33:37,083
if they actually are suicidality,

629
00:33:37,083 --> 00:33:39,999
and you're asking

630
00:33:39,999 --> 00:33:44,292
like you're basically saying don't bother

631
00:33:44,292 --> 00:33:48,584
You're not going to get a yes

632
00:33:48,584 --> 00:33:52,542
depending on their response,

633
00:33:52,542 --> 00:33:56,834
is a screen shot of what's actually

634
00:33:56,834 --> 00:33:58,417
This

635
00:33:58,417 --> 00:34:01,459
that volunteers actually use

636
00:34:01,459 --> 00:34:03,626
off all these boxes.

637
00:34:03,626 --> 00:34:07,375
I know it's really little we're going

638
00:34:07,375 --> 00:34:08,542
You don't have to check

639
00:34:08,542 --> 00:34:10,918
to do a successful intervention.

640
00:34:10,918 --> 00:34:12,334
This is just

641
00:34:12,334 --> 00:34:14,626
everybody everyone loves.

642
00:34:14,626 --> 00:34:18,999
So once you get a yes to this sort

643
00:34:18,999 --> 00:34:21,584
a threat assessment.

644
00:34:21,626 --> 00:34:25,167
So first, immediate state.

645
00:34:25,501 --> 00:34:27,083
This is probably more relevant

646
00:34:27,083 --> 00:34:28,584
up the phone.

647
00:34:28,584 --> 00:34:31,334
If a suicide is already in progress,

648
00:34:31,876 --> 00:34:33,751
You can't handle that yourself.

649
00:34:34,083 --> 00:34:36,999
Are they currently under influence

650
00:34:37,083 --> 00:34:39,292
Are methods nearby.

651
00:34:39,292 --> 00:34:41,459
You usually can't convince somebody

652
00:34:41,459 --> 00:34:44,501
there's a long trust building process

653
00:34:44,918 --> 00:34:47,167
But eventually they will.

654
00:34:47,751 --> 00:34:51,667
And also self harm is there self harm

655
00:34:51,667 --> 00:34:53,083
Is it part of their world view?

656
00:34:53,083 --> 00:34:54,083
Whatever.

657
00:34:54,083 --> 00:34:56,918
That's the first triage that you do.

658
00:34:56,918 --> 00:34:58,999
But we're going to assume

659
00:34:58,999 --> 00:35:00,459
this critical.

660
00:35:00,459 --> 00:35:02,876
Are you currently suicidal?

661
00:35:02,999 --> 00:35:05,584
This is the meat we're looking for.

662
00:35:07,334 --> 00:35:11,250
Are you having suicidal recently

663
00:35:11,250 --> 00:35:13,626
is the buffer zone.

664
00:35:14,876 --> 00:35:18,209
Was the person asked directly

665
00:35:18,209 --> 00:35:19,209
We asked that.

666
00:35:19,209 --> 00:35:24,584
If this current intent exists,

667
00:35:24,584 --> 00:35:25,626
Do you have a method?

668
00:35:25,999 --> 00:35:27,918
Do you have easy access to that?

669
00:35:27,918 --> 00:35:32,918
So the more concrete someone's idea

670
00:35:32,999 --> 00:35:36,167
Obviously if you say yeah, I'm going

671
00:35:36,167 --> 00:35:38,999
and you have that gun

672
00:35:38,999 --> 00:35:42,375
is and you have things in order,

673
00:35:42,375 --> 00:35:45,751
if somebody says I have pills

674
00:35:45,751 --> 00:35:48,501
but I just don't want to be here.

675
00:35:48,501 --> 00:35:50,292
That risk is lowered.

676
00:35:50,417 --> 00:35:54,667
Doesn't mean you walk away

677
00:35:54,999 --> 00:35:58,626
Capability and desire is how strongly

678
00:35:58,626 --> 00:36:02,709
to actually execute

679
00:36:02,709 --> 00:36:04,542
So have you made prior attempts?

680
00:36:04,542 --> 00:36:06,876
Remember the early graph

681
00:36:06,876 --> 00:36:08,959
of future attempts.

682
00:36:08,999 --> 00:36:13,209
Have you made rehearsals not quite

683
00:36:13,999 --> 00:36:19,250
There's entire addiction underlying

684
00:36:19,250 --> 00:36:21,209
to talk about.

685
00:36:21,709 --> 00:36:26,334
It's like a safety blanket where people

686
00:36:26,334 --> 00:36:29,209
problems don't exist any more.

687
00:36:29,751 --> 00:36:31,626
Digging down to where

688
00:36:31,626 --> 00:36:34,876
out of the fantasy world

689
00:36:35,709 --> 00:36:38,584
You document what's wrong, why not?

690
00:36:38,584 --> 00:36:39,876
Why not tomorrow?

691
00:36:40,083 --> 00:36:41,125
Why not now?

692
00:36:41,334 --> 00:36:43,083
What are the buffers?

693
00:36:43,083 --> 00:36:45,375
You want to start eliciting

694
00:36:46,667 --> 00:36:48,834
And who else is involved?

695
00:36:48,834 --> 00:36:51,999
You don't want to try

696
00:36:51,999 --> 00:36:55,999
So risk indicators, this is your desire,

697
00:36:56,209 --> 00:36:57,999
This builds the profile.

698
00:36:57,999 --> 00:37:00,375
This is where you find

699
00:37:00,375 --> 00:37:02,999
or are they feeling lonely?

700
00:37:02,999 --> 00:37:05,167
Do they feel like a burden

701
00:37:05,250 --> 00:37:08,083
This is the core

702
00:37:08,083 --> 00:37:09,834
you'll see.

703
00:37:09,918 --> 00:37:12,918
Their intent would be again

704
00:37:12,918 --> 00:37:16,959
you already called 911

705
00:37:16,959 --> 00:37:18,959
This is a check box to some

706
00:37:18,959 --> 00:37:20,918
describing before.

707
00:37:20,918 --> 00:37:23,501
But just you kind of learn to kind

708
00:37:23,501 --> 00:37:27,083
the various check boxes

709
00:37:27,083 --> 00:37:29,999
of the various types of people.

710
00:37:31,626 --> 00:37:35,959
Obviously all of our lives are individual

711
00:37:35,959 --> 00:37:38,083
of categories, I guess.

712
00:37:38,083 --> 00:37:39,999
And then your buffers.

713
00:37:39,999 --> 00:37:42,999
Internal buffers always better than

714
00:37:42,999 --> 00:37:44,459
If you can cope with stress.

715
00:37:46,375 --> 00:37:49,375
Spiritual believes tend

716
00:37:49,709 --> 00:37:53,083
If you have a purpose in life or

717
00:37:53,083 --> 00:37:54,999
is a big one.

718
00:37:56,083 --> 00:37:59,250
I remember talking to someone

719
00:37:59,250 --> 00:38:02,626
and then they said well, God,

720
00:38:02,626 --> 00:38:06,209
to have to do it differently

721
00:38:06,209 --> 00:38:09,083
I was just like oh, okay,

722
00:38:09,083 --> 00:38:12,125
so I guess risk lowered, good.

723
00:38:13,083 --> 00:38:15,250
And then external

724
00:38:15,250 --> 00:38:18,209
your community bonds,

725
00:38:18,542 --> 00:38:21,334
We may feel isolated just

726
00:38:21,334 --> 00:38:24,167
behind our computer every day.

727
00:38:24,167 --> 00:38:27,459
But that doesn't mean that we're not

728
00:38:27,459 --> 00:38:29,250
Doesn't mean we don't have people

729
00:38:29,250 --> 00:38:31,709
have strong relationships,

730
00:38:31,709 --> 00:38:34,083
and people that are there for us.

731
00:38:34,125 --> 00:38:39,250
And then out comes and next actions.

732
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:42,542
This is the GTD portion

733
00:38:42,542 --> 00:38:43,542
So you never walk away

734
00:38:43,542 --> 00:38:46,083
without having your next actions

735
00:38:46,083 --> 00:38:47,834
is responsible.

736
00:38:47,876 --> 00:38:51,918
So you want

737
00:38:51,918 --> 00:38:56,999
persuaded to accept assistance

738
00:38:56,999 --> 00:39:00,083
a commitment to safety.

739
00:39:00,459 --> 00:39:04,834
A commitment to safety

740
00:39:04,834 --> 00:39:07,167
If you're going to let someone

741
00:39:07,209 --> 00:39:11,083
This is where the person agrees

742
00:39:11,083 --> 00:39:14,709
to not use drugs and alcohol.

743
00:39:14,709 --> 00:39:17,834
And to not kill themselves

744
00:39:17,834 --> 00:39:23,709
until you've had you know, more time

745
00:39:23,709 --> 00:39:26,999
It's basically a safety bubble that they're

746
00:39:27,167 --> 00:39:29,999
And it's critical

747
00:39:30,792 --> 00:39:33,792
People are incredibly determined.

748
00:39:34,459 --> 00:39:39,083
We cannot change their minds

749
00:39:39,083 --> 00:39:42,167
There are people

750
00:39:42,167 --> 00:39:47,167
ways to kill themselves when they're

751
00:39:47,709 --> 00:39:52,167
It's best not to lock them

752
00:39:52,167 --> 00:39:53,999
Sometimes it takes a while.

753
00:39:55,334 --> 00:39:57,083
Here's a threat assessment.

754
00:40:00,250 --> 00:40:04,999
At this point we've walked

755
00:40:04,999 --> 00:40:06,334
You've got a good idea

756
00:40:06,334 --> 00:40:10,501
on with the current situation,

757
00:40:10,501 --> 00:40:12,083
And you're willing to make a call.

758
00:40:12,083 --> 00:40:14,125
Is it high risk, moderate risk, low risk.

759
00:40:14,709 --> 00:40:18,709
What's most important

760
00:40:18,709 --> 00:40:23,751
on this one this is also

761
00:40:23,751 --> 00:40:25,918
So you can kind of use it.

762
00:40:26,417 --> 00:40:29,792
But generally, the people that you

763
00:40:29,792 --> 00:40:31,584
to be high risk.

764
00:40:31,584 --> 00:40:33,834
They probably won't even be moderate

765
00:40:37,626 --> 00:40:44,626
When you do a friendtervention

766
00:40:44,626 --> 00:40:48,584
or form,

767
00:40:48,584 --> 00:40:56,167
like an ungodly life and death isn't

768
00:40:58,209 --> 00:41:01,083
It's a nebulous idea they're having.

769
00:41:01,417 --> 00:41:05,999
So you're most likely statistically

770
00:41:05,999 --> 00:41:08,501
So in that case, you want

771
00:41:08,501 --> 00:41:12,667
to get them referral and then you can

772
00:41:14,959 --> 00:41:18,542
If you do have

773
00:41:18,542 --> 00:41:20,918
is a progression

774
00:41:20,918 --> 00:41:24,167
through an ER system

775
00:41:24,167 --> 00:41:28,667
involuntary commitment, it

776
00:41:28,751 --> 00:41:32,876
We don't have enough time to deal

777
00:41:32,876 --> 00:41:35,999
on that, I'm happy to talk about you.

778
00:41:35,999 --> 00:41:38,751
But it varies incredibly based

779
00:41:40,584 --> 00:41:42,999
It could be anything, honestly.

780
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:47,667
Some states have great systems,

781
00:41:47,667 --> 00:41:50,626
the person in crisis

782
00:41:50,626 --> 00:41:53,250
in getting better help.

783
00:41:53,250 --> 00:41:55,584
You've established a commitment

784
00:41:55,584 --> 00:41:56,999
You have a safe space

785
00:41:56,999 --> 00:42:00,999
out for the next few hours

786
00:42:01,375 --> 00:42:03,209
Enlist other people.

787
00:42:03,209 --> 00:42:06,501
You want to keep them around,

788
00:42:06,501 --> 00:42:08,834
from being alone.

789
00:42:08,999 --> 00:42:12,083
You want to get them online resources

790
00:42:12,083 --> 00:42:14,375
for the future, maybe.

791
00:42:14,667 --> 00:42:17,999
But most importantly, you want

792
00:42:17,999 --> 00:42:22,209
and also you can move towards

793
00:42:23,125 --> 00:42:26,334
So this is kind of towards the end here,

794
00:42:26,334 --> 00:42:28,999
of people haven't seen before,

795
00:42:28,999 --> 00:42:31,542
of disappointing

796
00:42:31,542 --> 00:42:34,334
of any mental health strategy

797
00:42:34,334 --> 00:42:35,999
for yourself.

798
00:42:36,459 --> 00:42:40,999
So a crisis plan

799
00:42:40,999 --> 00:42:43,459
When you're not in a crisis.

800
00:42:43,918 --> 00:42:47,083
You identify your personal triggers,

801
00:42:47,083 --> 00:42:51,999
stuff that tells you personally that

802
00:42:51,999 --> 00:42:55,751
Your goal is to start outsmarting your

803
00:42:55,751 --> 00:43:00,209
brain is telling you that it needs

804
00:43:00,209 --> 00:43:01,792
to stop.

805
00:43:02,584 --> 00:43:05,999
It's actually very effective and one

806
00:43:05,999 --> 00:43:08,459
out earlier on the slide

807
00:43:08,459 --> 00:43:11,999
is called "how I stayed alive when my

808
00:43:11,999 --> 00:43:15,083
and it's a story of a woman

809
00:43:15,083 --> 00:43:18,417
she finally implemented this crisis plan.

810
00:43:18,667 --> 00:43:22,209
She said she had printed out copies

811
00:43:22,209 --> 00:43:27,083
and wall and given them to friends

812
00:43:27,083 --> 00:43:30,709
and refused to do anything

813
00:43:30,709 --> 00:43:35,083
and that's what finally got her

814
00:43:35,083 --> 00:43:39,375
than constantly trying to refer

815
00:43:39,959 --> 00:43:42,709
There's an example that's filled out.

816
00:43:44,292 --> 00:43:48,584
And there's a blank template you can fill

817
00:43:49,209 --> 00:43:57,626
So the crisis plan is really critical

818
00:43:57,667 --> 00:44:03,792
And I don't know how to describe that.

819
00:44:03,792 --> 00:44:04,792
I guess.

820
00:44:04,792 --> 00:44:08,375
It really helps you have an range

821
00:44:08,459 --> 00:44:10,584
I know we're rolling towards the end.

822
00:44:10,834 --> 00:44:13,999
Tactical crisis,

823
00:44:13,999 --> 00:44:18,375
to include toward the end

824
00:44:20,459 --> 00:44:24,375
So you, 911, therapist, hotlines this

825
00:44:24,375 --> 00:44:27,959
at if you want to get involved

826
00:44:27,999 --> 00:44:30,375
There's channels on IRC.

827
00:44:30,375 --> 00:44:31,999
There's subReddits.

828
00:44:31,999 --> 00:44:34,834
Our suicide watch is a good one.

829
00:44:35,250 --> 00:44:38,626
Our suicidology has

830
00:44:38,626 --> 00:44:40,375
a few sites.

831
00:44:40,459 --> 00:44:43,667
I tried to find some technically oriented.

832
00:44:43,667 --> 00:44:46,125
I talked

833
00:44:46,125 --> 00:44:48,626
and rose and died.

834
00:44:49,375 --> 00:44:53,999
If anybody would like to talk about this,

835
00:44:53,999 --> 00:44:56,626
the length

836
00:44:56,626 --> 00:44:58,125
at source.

837
00:44:58,125 --> 00:45:01,209
So there's just tons and tons

838
00:45:01,709 --> 00:45:04,584
So it's it might be useful

839
00:45:04,584 --> 00:45:08,792
down deeper and education

840
00:45:08,792 --> 00:45:13,125
be your first line of defense to hand

841
00:45:13,667 --> 00:45:16,083
Most of these organizations started

842
00:45:16,167 --> 00:45:20,125
It's a nascent area of study surprisingly,

843
00:45:20,125 --> 00:45:23,667
to our cultural things and these are

844
00:45:23,667 --> 00:45:27,417
about all the other stuff that's here.

845
00:45:27,876 --> 00:45:29,792
And I have questions.

846
00:45:29,999 --> 00:45:31,667
So thank you.

847
00:45:31,999 --> 00:45:34,999
I want to thank everybody

848
00:45:34,999 --> 00:45:36,334
AMBER BALDET: Okay, clap.

849
00:45:45,999 --> 00:45:47,083
Fine.

850
00:45:47,083 --> 00:45:49,292
I want to thank everybody

851
00:45:49,292 --> 00:45:52,834
about this and I want to feel

852
00:45:52,834 --> 00:45:55,751
knowledge and outline these steps

853
00:45:55,751 --> 00:45:57,876
out of here not depressed

854
00:45:57,876 --> 00:46:01,667
about the change that we can make

855
00:46:01,667 --> 00:46:04,709
So I'll do I mean,

856
00:46:04,709 --> 00:46:09,417
up but I can do Q&A in here

857
00:46:09,667 --> 00:46:11,250
Does anybody have like a counter.

858
00:46:11,250 --> 00:46:12,834
Do they give me extra time

859
00:46:12,834 --> 00:46:15,501
a counter up here,

860
00:46:15,918 --> 00:46:17,083
Okay.

861
00:46:17,417 --> 00:46:21,083
So does anybody have any questions

862
00:46:21,209 --> 00:46:23,626
Yeah, go ahead.

863
00:46:23,792 --> 00:46:27,459
AUDIENCE: Odd ethical sort

864
00:46:28,876 --> 00:46:30,999
I'll skip over the details.

865
00:46:30,999 --> 00:46:37,876
But a friend of mine she her life

866
00:46:38,834 --> 00:46:42,334
She has got chronic mental illness

867
00:46:42,334 --> 00:46:44,999
at the edge of homelessness.

868
00:46:44,999 --> 00:46:45,999
This sort of thing.

869
00:46:45,999 --> 00:46:51,999
AMBER BALDET: Your question

870
00:46:51,999 --> 00:46:52,999
That's your question.

871
00:46:58,417 --> 00:47:01,751
Right to die stuff, rational suicide.

872
00:47:01,751 --> 00:47:03,501
There is absolutely a case for that.

873
00:47:03,501 --> 00:47:07,876
It falls into a very different category

874
00:47:07,876 --> 00:47:11,083
Generally, the tenets

875
00:47:11,083 --> 00:47:16,083
terminal illness, support from friends

876
00:47:16,083 --> 00:47:21,501
a general comfort that everybody feels

877
00:47:21,709 --> 00:47:25,334
And in that case, I mean, personally,

878
00:47:25,751 --> 00:47:26,751
At all.

879
00:47:26,751 --> 00:47:28,834
But it's very different than people who

880
00:47:28,834 --> 00:47:32,751
will and I should have the right

881
00:47:34,125 --> 00:47:36,250
That may be the case.

882
00:47:36,250 --> 00:47:38,167
But as we talked about before,

883
00:47:38,167 --> 00:47:40,999
in the same way that it would normally.

884
00:47:41,751 --> 00:47:44,999
Like I mentioned at the beginning

885
00:47:44,999 --> 00:47:48,999
to completions, there's 15 attempts

886
00:47:48,999 --> 00:47:53,209
That didn't mean that every person

887
00:47:53,209 --> 00:47:55,876
No, it's a the vast majority

888
00:47:55,876 --> 00:47:59,999
do not complete suicide and never try

889
00:47:59,999 --> 00:48:01,667
about that.

890
00:48:02,459 --> 00:48:05,876
If those people were to have

891
00:48:05,876 --> 00:48:07,999
a different outcome,

892
00:48:07,999 --> 00:48:12,584
whether or not people actually are

893
00:48:12,584 --> 00:48:14,125
And that's the problem

894
00:48:14,125 --> 00:48:15,751
and failed.

895
00:48:15,999 --> 00:48:18,918
And also you're never going

896
00:48:18,918 --> 00:48:20,375
You only have failed attempts.

897
00:48:20,375 --> 00:48:22,083
So it doesn't really work.

898
00:48:22,083 --> 00:48:24,083
So that tends

899
00:48:24,083 --> 00:48:28,999
so we should also try to get rid

900
00:48:31,083 --> 00:48:33,167
There's a mic there.

901
00:48:34,999 --> 00:48:36,834
It's a meritocracy.

902
00:48:37,334 --> 00:48:43,167
I have a couple family members that

903
00:48:43,167 --> 00:48:47,999
about feeling suicidal and

904
00:48:47,999 --> 00:48:51,959
but I feel kind of helpless

905
00:48:51,959 --> 00:48:56,292
as a family member

906
00:48:56,292 --> 00:49:02,667
Also what to do when they both

907
00:49:02,667 --> 00:49:05,501
It's hard for me to know when

908
00:49:05,501 --> 00:49:09,167
of the time regardless

909
00:49:09,167 --> 00:49:11,999
to talk and talk and talk.

910
00:49:11,999 --> 00:49:13,459
That's the emotional exhaustion

911
00:49:13,459 --> 00:49:14,999
talking about.

912
00:49:15,375 --> 00:49:17,542
The difference with being

913
00:49:17,542 --> 00:49:19,999
is you have office hours

914
00:49:19,999 --> 00:49:22,417
and cannot speak with people,

915
00:49:22,417 --> 00:49:25,959
with your family even when they're not

916
00:49:25,999 --> 00:49:33,292
I would say that the crisis plan

917
00:49:33,501 --> 00:49:35,918
If you're a step

918
00:49:35,918 --> 00:49:39,999
all the other steps have been completed

919
00:49:39,999 --> 00:49:42,083
Did you already go walk your dog?

920
00:49:42,292 --> 00:49:45,083
Did you already journal today?

921
00:49:50,999 --> 00:49:54,999
Starting to take back your time you're

922
00:49:54,999 --> 00:49:58,999
you're supposed to be level or two

923
00:50:02,375 --> 00:50:05,501
It isn't always easy to enforce but,

924
00:50:05,501 --> 00:50:08,584
like you're working with them

925
00:50:08,584 --> 00:50:13,209
they call that it's valuable,

926
00:50:13,209 --> 00:50:14,459
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

927
00:50:18,999 --> 00:50:20,918
AMBER BALDET: Yeah.

928
00:50:20,918 --> 00:50:22,834
AUDIENCE: I'm render man.

929
00:50:25,876 --> 00:50:29,999
In February I went

930
00:50:29,999 --> 00:50:33,834
with depression which many of us do.

931
00:50:37,250 --> 00:50:41,209
We have a community we need

932
00:50:41,209 --> 00:50:45,876
out and we've lost a lot

933
00:50:45,876 --> 00:50:49,250
of people we haven't heard about.

934
00:50:51,918 --> 00:50:53,999
And we need to have

935
00:50:53,999 --> 00:50:55,999
within this community.

936
00:50:56,834 --> 00:50:59,876
To destigmatize depression

937
00:50:59,876 --> 00:51:05,999
out and you know taking that handed

938
00:51:05,999 --> 00:51:08,999
AMBER BALDET: I completely agree

939
00:51:08,999 --> 00:51:12,250
In a way we're progressively ahead

940
00:51:12,250 --> 00:51:14,959
a little counterintuitive.

941
00:51:15,167 --> 00:51:21,584
But because we're here,

942
00:51:21,584 --> 00:51:27,959
the stigma perpetuates all of society.

943
00:51:29,459 --> 00:51:34,918
Especially the mental health industrial

944
00:51:34,918 --> 00:51:39,292
we have done some really terrible

945
00:51:40,083 --> 00:51:43,334
We've we stigmatized it intentionally.

946
00:51:43,334 --> 00:51:46,083
In the 1800s,

947
00:51:46,083 --> 00:51:49,083
on religious grounds.

948
00:51:49,626 --> 00:51:51,834
In England

949
00:51:51,834 --> 00:51:54,999
from the person whose job it was

950
00:51:54,999 --> 00:51:59,584
a death was a suicide because if it was,

951
00:51:59,584 --> 00:52:03,209
and property to the crown

952
00:52:03,209 --> 00:52:05,999
of the crown and the coroner.

953
00:52:06,626 --> 00:52:20,542
And we're done.
