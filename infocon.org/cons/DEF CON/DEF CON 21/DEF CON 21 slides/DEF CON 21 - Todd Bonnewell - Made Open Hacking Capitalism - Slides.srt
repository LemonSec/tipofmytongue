00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,417
TODD BONNEWELL: Good morning, everybody.

2
00:00:02,417 --> 00:00:03,751
I'm going to get started.

3
00:00:03,751 --> 00:00:05,417
My name is Todd with MadeOpen.com.

4
00:00:05,751 --> 00:00:08,542
Is the sound all right out there.?

5
00:00:08,542 --> 00:00:09,542
Yeah?

6
00:00:09,542 --> 00:00:10,542
All right.

7
00:00:10,542 --> 00:00:14,042
It looks like our chairs didn't meet their expectations with the number

8
00:00:14,042 --> 00:00:16,999
of people, but I appreciate everybody coming

9
00:00:16,999 --> 00:00:19,918
out this morning, and I'm going to get started

10
00:00:19,918 --> 00:00:22,626
by talking about capitalism.

11
00:00:22,999 --> 00:00:27,834
Why we have it, what the need for it is, and what we need to do as a people

12
00:00:27,834 --> 00:00:30,626
to to move forward in a direction that makes

13
00:00:30,626 --> 00:00:34,167
a little more sense to to everybody here and everyone we

14
00:00:34,167 --> 00:00:36,083
know and love.

15
00:00:36,209 --> 00:00:40,918
So to get started, basically capitalism and government

16
00:00:40,918 --> 00:00:46,250
are just two systems that we as people created.

17
00:00:46,999 --> 00:00:48,999
This is nothing that we were we happened

18
00:00:48,999 --> 00:00:51,918
to be born with, it but it was nothing that was here

19
00:00:51,918 --> 00:00:53,918
before we got here.

20
00:00:53,918 --> 00:00:57,626
We as people created these systems and why do we create systems?

21
00:00:57,876 --> 00:01:00,083
Well, we have a need.

22
00:01:00,083 --> 00:01:02,751
We have several needs, and we solve problems

23
00:01:02,751 --> 00:01:04,999
through systems.

24
00:01:04,999 --> 00:01:05,999
It's the way we think.

25
00:01:06,083 --> 00:01:09,417
And through time, these systems have been created,

26
00:01:09,417 --> 00:01:12,999
capitalism, through the market solves problems,

27
00:01:12,999 --> 00:01:17,751
there's study on capitalism and markets and supply and demand,

28
00:01:17,751 --> 00:01:22,375
but I'm looking here at more of a fundamental fundamental need

29
00:01:22,375 --> 00:01:27,999
for these systems, and what I see is that markets solve people's problems

30
00:01:27,999 --> 00:01:32,584
and when markets can't solve somebody's problem, that's well,

31
00:01:32,584 --> 00:01:36,125
that's where we create governments.

32
00:01:36,125 --> 00:01:39,751
Governments step in to take care of the problems that markets cannot

33
00:01:39,751 --> 00:01:41,709
or do not solve.

34
00:01:43,876 --> 00:01:46,999
Well why wouldn't a market solve a problem?

35
00:01:46,999 --> 00:01:51,125
If we look at capitalism, we can see the answer to this is pretty evident,

36
00:01:51,125 --> 00:01:54,999
where capitalism being defined as a socioeconomic system,

37
00:01:54,999 --> 00:01:59,459
where goods and services are produced for profit, we see right there,

38
00:01:59,459 --> 00:02:03,999
that the very definition of capitalism is for profit.

39
00:02:03,999 --> 00:02:10,501
If corporations don't see profit, they don't do business there.

40
00:02:10,751 --> 00:02:13,083
So we continue to have problems that

41
00:02:13,083 --> 00:02:16,083
the market doesn't solve.

42
00:02:16,083 --> 00:02:20,876
So we need other systems and we create governments

43
00:02:20,876 --> 00:02:23,209
and problems.

44
00:02:24,999 --> 00:02:28,709
Let's not try if we can all agree here, and please, we'll stop right now,

45
00:02:28,709 --> 00:02:31,999
if anybody you know, and we have a discussion.

46
00:02:31,999 --> 00:02:35,417
If anybody doesn't agree to some level, corporations don't control

47
00:02:35,417 --> 00:02:39,999
the government, that's a I mean, that's a fundamental assumption that

48
00:02:39,999 --> 00:02:42,501
I'm making is that we can agree that

49
00:02:42,501 --> 00:02:47,417
without corporations, governments will act a little more efficiently, and

50
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:50,167
a lot of the problems that we have created

51
00:02:50,167 --> 00:02:55,501
by these two systems are problems that are not people problems.

52
00:02:55,501 --> 00:03:00,751
These are problems that have been given to us by these institutions.

53
00:03:00,999 --> 00:03:04,083
So to say it's not to say that we don't need government

54
00:03:04,083 --> 00:03:06,834
or their systems are bad.

55
00:03:06,834 --> 00:03:10,999
These are systems that we created to solve these problems.

56
00:03:10,999 --> 00:03:13,999
So what I want to do is fundamentally get at what do we

57
00:03:13,999 --> 00:03:16,834
as people, what do we want?

58
00:03:16,834 --> 00:03:17,876
What do we need?

59
00:03:17,876 --> 00:03:19,125
What are we looking to do?

60
00:03:19,125 --> 00:03:22,083
You know, we have these systems but these are old systems.

61
00:03:22,209 --> 00:03:24,999
You know, these are these are systems that are

62
00:03:24,999 --> 00:03:29,375
great, great relatives, you know, created at some point in time

63
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:31,792
to solve a problem.

64
00:03:31,834 --> 00:03:34,999
Corruption is entered over time, and but, again, I would try

65
00:03:34,999 --> 00:03:37,792
to stay away from those topics of corruption

66
00:03:37,792 --> 00:03:42,209
because if we can just agree that we can attack capitalism here, and play

67
00:03:42,209 --> 00:03:46,542
the game of capitalism, that some of the government things will those

68
00:03:46,542 --> 00:03:49,125
will shake themselves out and we won't have

69
00:03:49,125 --> 00:03:54,334
to focus our attention there and some problems will just disappear.

70
00:03:54,584 --> 00:04:00,292
And, so what I want to talk about is the is our problems.

71
00:04:00,709 --> 00:04:03,083
What do we have as problems as people.

72
00:04:03,334 --> 00:04:04,626
We have needs.

73
00:04:04,626 --> 00:04:07,584
We have desires excuse me, we have fundamental needs

74
00:04:07,584 --> 00:04:11,334
and desires, food, clothing, shelter.

75
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:13,751
We have needs of safety which enters

76
00:04:13,751 --> 00:04:17,083
in the whole idea of currency.

77
00:04:17,083 --> 00:04:22,751
What is currency, but just a futures of something that you want or need.

78
00:04:22,751 --> 00:04:24,083
If you didn't want or need anything in the future,

79
00:04:24,083 --> 00:04:27,083
you certainly wouldn't have a need for currency.

80
00:04:28,083 --> 00:04:34,751
So I want us to start thinking about where are we going.

81
00:04:35,834 --> 00:04:38,999
Because I don't think many people are asking that question.

82
00:04:38,999 --> 00:04:42,792
We are all caught up in our day to day stuff and our heads are

83
00:04:42,792 --> 00:04:46,751
down and we work extremely long hours and, you know,

84
00:04:46,751 --> 00:04:50,209
what does this give us in the end?

85
00:04:50,209 --> 00:04:51,209
Where are we going?

86
00:04:51,209 --> 00:04:55,209
And if we lift our heads up for a second, where do we want to be?

87
00:04:55,751 --> 00:04:59,167
And we have to make the simple assumption that we're

88
00:04:59,167 --> 00:05:03,250
automating more and more and more stuff.

89
00:05:03,417 --> 00:05:07,417
And when that stuff gets automated, down this path that we are headed

90
00:05:07,417 --> 00:05:11,667
down now, with our heads down, we eventually get that pink slip,

91
00:05:11,667 --> 00:05:13,751
we get laid off.

92
00:05:13,751 --> 00:05:15,667
Automation, it will solve our problems

93
00:05:15,667 --> 00:05:18,999
but not our problems at this rate.

94
00:05:20,209 --> 00:05:24,542
What we have in the end, we have fully automated corporations.

95
00:05:24,542 --> 00:05:28,083
We have several people standing outside of these corporations saying,

96
00:05:28,083 --> 00:05:32,209
we want your goods or services, and the corporations are saying, yeah,

97
00:05:32,209 --> 00:05:34,876
remember that costs money.

98
00:05:35,125 --> 00:05:38,459
And we say, well, we don't have any jobs anymore.

99
00:05:38,584 --> 00:05:41,209
And the point is, not to have that discussion.

100
00:05:41,209 --> 00:05:43,999
The point is to say, forget that discussion.

101
00:05:43,999 --> 00:05:48,999
Let's talk about what we want and need, assuming we will automate everything.

102
00:05:49,292 --> 00:05:51,834
Because I think that's a simple assumption to make that

103
00:05:51,834 --> 00:05:54,876
at some point in the future, whether it's 5 or 500 years,

104
00:05:54,876 --> 00:05:58,209
that we're going to fully automate everything.

105
00:05:58,292 --> 00:06:00,542
So if we think about that, as a people and say, okay,

106
00:06:00,542 --> 00:06:03,209
how do we control that automation?

107
00:06:03,209 --> 00:06:05,667
Because clearly, the way we're doing it now

108
00:06:05,667 --> 00:06:11,083
is not going to result in the people owning this automation.

109
00:06:12,083 --> 00:06:17,083
So and, again, down that path, nothing I don't believe anything good

110
00:06:17,083 --> 00:06:18,876
is there.

111
00:06:18,876 --> 00:06:21,999
I mean, we can talk for an hour about how we take this thing back,

112
00:06:21,999 --> 00:06:25,999
when everything is fully automated and whether it's redistribution

113
00:06:25,999 --> 00:06:30,167
or wealth, all the revolution, everything that could possibly happen,

114
00:06:30,167 --> 00:06:32,459
let's not get there.

115
00:06:32,459 --> 00:06:35,083
Let's be smarter than the people before us.

116
00:06:35,083 --> 00:06:36,083
Right?

117
00:06:36,083 --> 00:06:39,125
Because after all, isn't this really about the future.

118
00:06:39,125 --> 00:06:42,292
Isn't this about our children and our children's children?

119
00:06:42,501 --> 00:06:45,959
At the end of the day, I'm not working so that my bank

120
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:48,999
account can be a certain size so that my kids smile

121
00:06:48,999 --> 00:06:52,959
when I die saying, oh, good, I got some money.

122
00:06:53,083 --> 00:06:55,584
I'm looking to make this place better.

123
00:06:55,584 --> 00:06:59,667
I'm looking to make this place better in some substantial ways.

124
00:06:59,667 --> 00:07:01,999
So what would a system look like?

125
00:07:01,999 --> 00:07:03,999
What would everyone here be happy with?

126
00:07:03,999 --> 00:07:06,999
And that's a you know, we're really talking some ideologies

127
00:07:06,999 --> 00:07:11,792
and to me, the most simple answer to that question is to ask people,

128
00:07:11,792 --> 00:07:14,584
what do you want and need?

129
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:17,959
And what are you willing or able to do?

130
00:07:17,999 --> 00:07:21,542
Now, with these two questions, these are fundamental questions

131
00:07:21,542 --> 00:07:24,751
and I don't think, you know, good or bad people it's not

132
00:07:24,751 --> 00:07:28,999
the answers don't have to be the same, but the questions.

133
00:07:29,792 --> 00:07:35,417
It's that those questions fundamentally resonate with people no matter,

134
00:07:35,417 --> 00:07:38,834
what because it's about them.

135
00:07:38,918 --> 00:07:40,959
It's about the individual.

136
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:43,999
It's not about the entire collective.

137
00:07:43,999 --> 00:07:46,125
We are asking you, what do you want and need?

138
00:07:46,417 --> 00:07:48,501
Just tell us, because I mean I would certainly rather

139
00:07:48,501 --> 00:07:50,834
be working in the sim where I knew what people

140
00:07:50,834 --> 00:07:54,083
want and needed and these things were measurable.

141
00:07:55,209 --> 00:07:58,876
And then the other side of it is, what are you willing or table to do?

142
00:07:58,876 --> 00:08:01,834
Now, we have not automated everything yet.

143
00:08:01,834 --> 00:08:04,751
So we do have to live in this in this world that we that we still live in,

144
00:08:04,751 --> 00:08:07,542
where not everything is automated.

145
00:08:07,542 --> 00:08:09,209
So what do we do?

146
00:08:09,209 --> 00:08:11,375
We need to figure out a way to still solve problems,

147
00:08:11,375 --> 00:08:14,334
up until the point of automation.

148
00:08:14,501 --> 00:08:18,167
But, again, it's to get the it's to get that vision.

149
00:08:18,167 --> 00:08:19,999
It's to get that collective vision that says, okay,

150
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:23,083
we know there's this point we want to reach, where everything

151
00:08:23,083 --> 00:08:26,167
is automated and we just kind of get everything that we need,

152
00:08:26,167 --> 00:08:28,542
and we can kind of focus on whatever we want

153
00:08:28,542 --> 00:08:31,083
because everything is automated.

154
00:08:31,083 --> 00:08:32,999
So we can do whatever we want to do.

155
00:08:32,999 --> 00:08:36,250
So it's not to really focus on what that vision would look

156
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:39,459
like out there, but to say what its fundamental

157
00:08:39,459 --> 00:08:41,999
requirements would be.

158
00:08:41,999 --> 00:08:46,709
And I believe two fundamental columns, wants and needs and what

159
00:08:46,709 --> 00:08:50,417
they are willing and able to do.

160
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:58,250
When people are willing and able to do, people are able to do amazing things.

161
00:08:58,292 --> 00:09:02,459
We are not at a loss for people doing amazing things.

162
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:05,334
We are at a loss for direction.

163
00:09:05,334 --> 00:09:08,292
We are at a loss for people doing amazing thins

164
00:09:08,292 --> 00:09:12,999
because they are doing them because they get the self benefit,

165
00:09:12,999 --> 00:09:15,999
not the benefit of humanity.

166
00:09:17,083 --> 00:09:24,083
So if we look at those things, how what are these things.

167
00:09:24,083 --> 00:09:28,709
What are these things that we can how do we arrange these things that we

168
00:09:28,709 --> 00:09:30,792
want and need.

169
00:09:30,999 --> 00:09:35,999
And I believe to have that discussion, we need to be talking

170
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:39,999
about the only resource in human history that

171
00:09:39,999 --> 00:09:44,999
is not been able to be controlled by force.

172
00:09:45,125 --> 00:09:51,417
So you can't physically control data like you can physically control oil

173
00:09:51,417 --> 00:09:53,999
or land or water.

174
00:09:53,999 --> 00:09:58,417
So we're constantly creating this resource called data and we don't stop

175
00:09:58,417 --> 00:10:00,999
creating this resource.

176
00:10:00,999 --> 00:10:04,417
This resource, we continue to create and we don't create it

177
00:10:04,417 --> 00:10:08,999
in a static way, in a linear fashion in growth.

178
00:10:08,999 --> 00:10:10,125
It is exponential.

179
00:10:10,167 --> 00:10:12,918
You know, what else are we going to be collecting?

180
00:10:12,918 --> 00:10:16,292
It's not just data like location and pictures.

181
00:10:16,292 --> 00:10:19,999
This is medical information.

182
00:10:19,999 --> 00:10:23,876
I mean, we're at the macro level, there's not really a lot to collect.

183
00:10:23,999 --> 00:10:30,250
We have we keep collecting more and more about ourselves, but why?

184
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:32,542
What are we going to do with all of this data?

185
00:10:32,542 --> 00:10:35,999
Well, it's not us that's doing anything with that data that's that's productive,

186
00:10:35,999 --> 00:10:40,167
that's corporations and we're just getting a glimpse in what we are

187
00:10:40,167 --> 00:10:45,751
all about and into what we do and they are already calling it big data.

188
00:10:45,751 --> 00:10:46,999
What's next?

189
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,542
After big data, what comes?

190
00:10:50,542 --> 00:10:51,626
Huge data?

191
00:10:51,667 --> 00:10:57,999
It just doesn't it's not something that it should be big data small.

192
00:10:57,999 --> 00:11:00,083
It should be big data personal, right?

193
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:04,167
And we have a lot of talk about data these days and I want

194
00:11:04,167 --> 00:11:07,334
to take a take a few minutes right now to talk

195
00:11:07,334 --> 00:11:10,751
about what data is, because there's a lot of talk

196
00:11:10,751 --> 00:11:13,876
about data privacy, but there's one thing that

197
00:11:13,876 --> 00:11:16,959
is assumed when the word "data privacy" comes

198
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:19,501
out of somebody's mouth.

199
00:11:19,999 --> 00:11:23,959
They have assumed you don't own your data because the conversation that

200
00:11:23,959 --> 00:11:26,459
ends all conversations about data privacy

201
00:11:26,459 --> 00:11:29,999
is the conversation about data ownership.

202
00:11:30,083 --> 00:11:33,209
You know, they are not on CNN and Fox talking

203
00:11:33,209 --> 00:11:39,083
about data privacy, where, you know, what do the people do with this?

204
00:11:39,083 --> 00:11:40,167
How do they control it?

205
00:11:40,167 --> 00:11:41,667
It is in the peoples.

206
00:11:41,667 --> 00:11:42,667
It's theirs.

207
00:11:42,918 --> 00:11:44,542
It's the corporation's.

208
00:11:44,542 --> 00:11:45,542
It's their data.

209
00:11:45,542 --> 00:11:46,542
It's not our data because if it was our data we wouldn't

210
00:11:46,542 --> 00:11:48,667
need to talk about privacy.

211
00:11:48,999 --> 00:11:52,834
We don't talk about, oh, geez, I hope the mortgage broker that sold me this

212
00:11:52,834 --> 00:11:56,083
house doesn't come in the house and make himself a sandwich

213
00:11:56,083 --> 00:11:58,709
in the middle of the night.

214
00:11:58,999 --> 00:12:02,667
We have certain things that we have to assume that we have the rights

215
00:12:02,667 --> 00:12:06,959
to and that privacy, through ownership is one of them.

216
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:10,751
And if we're not assuming that we have those rights, then we have you know,

217
00:12:10,751 --> 00:12:13,250
there's much bigger issues.

218
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:16,542
Those are personal liberties and these are personal freedoms.

219
00:12:18,876 --> 00:12:22,209
These are simple terms of use and we need

220
00:12:22,209 --> 00:12:25,250
to refocus on ownership.

221
00:12:25,626 --> 00:12:28,334
So, what is data?

222
00:12:28,584 --> 00:12:35,250
We have this notion of data being video, pictures, audio,

223
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:43,999
texts, yet we have four data types and we have thousands of services,

224
00:12:43,999 --> 00:12:49,292
all this to share four data types.

225
00:12:49,292 --> 00:12:50,667
Does that make any sense to anybody here,

226
00:12:50,667 --> 00:12:53,375
that we have thousands of services that your data

227
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:56,584
is spread over at least tens of services per person here,

228
00:12:56,584 --> 00:13:01,626
where your data is all over the place but you only have four data types.

229
00:13:02,999 --> 00:13:05,999
It makes absolutely no sense to me.

230
00:13:05,999 --> 00:13:08,834
I mean, I understand why and the definition of data I think,

231
00:13:08,834 --> 00:13:12,375
will clarify that in a few different ways.

232
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:16,459
Those four data types I talk about, that's not all data.

233
00:13:16,834 --> 00:13:20,918
That's all of what we store as data or past data and I believe there's three

234
00:13:20,918 --> 00:13:23,584
tenses when it comes to data.

235
00:13:23,584 --> 00:13:25,999
You have past, present and future.

236
00:13:26,083 --> 00:13:30,083
And I don't to my knowledge, there's nobody talking

237
00:13:30,083 --> 00:13:34,792
about three tenths of data and the reason is your past data

238
00:13:34,792 --> 00:13:39,334
is what you as a person, you feel this emotional attachment

239
00:13:39,334 --> 00:13:43,999
to your past data because that's what you did.

240
00:13:43,999 --> 00:13:45,083
That's where you were.

241
00:13:45,083 --> 00:13:46,083
That's what you know, those are pictures and I'm

242
00:13:46,083 --> 00:13:47,792
the same way.

243
00:13:48,125 --> 00:13:50,209
And that's very valuable to us.

244
00:13:50,667 --> 00:13:54,459
But at the same time, we understand as a people that it's more important

245
00:13:54,459 --> 00:13:58,417
to live in the moment, that right now is more important than what happened

246
00:13:58,417 --> 00:14:01,584
last week, but we still want that stuff.

247
00:14:01,584 --> 00:14:02,918
We still need that stuff.

248
00:14:03,083 --> 00:14:07,083
And our present data is called our attention.

249
00:14:07,751 --> 00:14:12,501
So if I have your attention now, I have your most valuable form of data.

250
00:14:12,501 --> 00:14:14,626
You might want to believe that your pictures

251
00:14:14,626 --> 00:14:17,501
of the past are worth more, but right now, this

252
00:14:17,501 --> 00:14:22,999
is all that makes a purchasing decision, when a corporation looks at data.

253
00:14:22,999 --> 00:14:24,125
It's your attention.

254
00:14:24,125 --> 00:14:27,083
It's the only thing that makes that click happen, because if a pop up comes

255
00:14:27,083 --> 00:14:30,999
up and a better deal appeals, that transaction is gone.

256
00:14:30,999 --> 00:14:34,209
The attention has never met your future data, which is your intention

257
00:14:34,209 --> 00:14:36,125
to do something.

258
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:41,999
With these three tenses of data, past, present and future, what are these

259
00:14:41,999 --> 00:14:44,125
to a corporation?

260
00:14:44,292 --> 00:14:46,292
How do they value them?

261
00:14:46,626 --> 00:14:49,584
And I will use Facebook as an example, just because they are the biggest

262
00:14:49,584 --> 00:14:52,083
and I don't like them very much.

263
00:14:52,083 --> 00:14:58,083
They are basically allowing you to put your past data somewhere.

264
00:14:58,083 --> 00:15:02,959
This is a very inexpensive resource to store.

265
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:03,999
We all know this.

266
00:15:04,999 --> 00:15:08,334
But why would they store something for us?

267
00:15:09,292 --> 00:15:11,834
It's so that we come back, right?

268
00:15:11,834 --> 00:15:17,292
So our intention is to come back, so that they have our attention.

269
00:15:17,876 --> 00:15:20,999
And when you see when these three different things, when you start

270
00:15:20,999 --> 00:15:22,999
to look in your daily lives and figure out,

271
00:15:22,999 --> 00:15:26,918
what are these three tenses of data, how do they apply to me?

272
00:15:26,999 --> 00:15:30,999
I'm a data creator and that's the way we need to look at it.

273
00:15:31,083 --> 00:15:33,999
These are data points that don't exist without people.

274
00:15:33,999 --> 00:15:40,459
If you create your own data, past, present and future, how do we do it?

275
00:15:40,459 --> 00:15:41,459
How do we manage it?

276
00:15:41,542 --> 00:15:45,083
Facebook, they certainly have all of them do.

277
00:15:45,083 --> 00:15:46,667
They want your data for the sole reason that you

278
00:15:46,667 --> 00:15:48,375
will come back.

279
00:15:48,375 --> 00:15:52,709
If you don't have the intent to come back, that's it.

280
00:15:52,709 --> 00:15:54,584
Their value is gone.

281
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:57,751
You know, if everybody had no intention

282
00:15:57,751 --> 00:16:03,459
to return to Facebook tomorrow, what would the stock do?

283
00:16:03,459 --> 00:16:07,292
It would have little to no value because it's about people's intention.

284
00:16:07,292 --> 00:16:10,584
And people don't realize the value of this intention.

285
00:16:10,792 --> 00:16:14,999
That's where I really want to focus our efforts,

286
00:16:14,999 --> 00:16:19,751
is on capturing your intent and your attention in order

287
00:16:19,751 --> 00:16:24,876
to compete in this game that we have inherited.

288
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:28,375
I believe that we can compete within capitalism,

289
00:16:28,375 --> 00:16:34,250
to have companies that are run by people, that create automated things

290
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:39,375
that do automated things that play in the market.

291
00:16:39,542 --> 00:16:44,667
But in the end, their responsible to the people.

292
00:16:44,667 --> 00:16:46,417
Because that's not what we have now.

293
00:16:46,999 --> 00:16:49,999
And we all know this and, you know, we have government officials telling us

294
00:16:49,999 --> 00:16:52,667
that we can't get anything done here.

295
00:16:52,667 --> 00:16:53,751
We can't do anything.

296
00:16:53,834 --> 00:16:55,626
And we as the people say, well, that's your job,

297
00:16:55,626 --> 00:16:59,292
but they say that's injure job as a people to direct us.

298
00:16:59,292 --> 00:17:00,999
So we're at this standstill.

299
00:17:00,999 --> 00:17:02,667
Where nobody knows what to do.

300
00:17:02,667 --> 00:17:05,584
We have too many you know, I see at the midpoint of my life,

301
00:17:05,584 --> 00:17:08,292
I see I look back and see the generations coming

302
00:17:08,292 --> 00:17:11,083
and these some are smart people.

303
00:17:11,501 --> 00:17:15,709
And I believe that I already need I feel like I already need to get

304
00:17:15,709 --> 00:17:19,375
out of the way and one of the biggest problems we have

305
00:17:19,375 --> 00:17:23,584
in corporations, it's greed, and the inability to get things

306
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:26,999
out of the way and let it progress.

307
00:17:28,125 --> 00:17:30,292
It's an older generation.

308
00:17:30,292 --> 00:17:31,709
We evolve as people.

309
00:17:31,709 --> 00:17:35,918
So what we need to do, we need to take this back, and we can do this

310
00:17:35,918 --> 00:17:40,751
by concentrating and focusing on this resource called data that, again,

311
00:17:40,751 --> 00:17:44,083
nobody is stopping us from diverting our attention

312
00:17:44,083 --> 00:17:46,501
from somewhere else.

313
00:17:46,501 --> 00:17:49,999
No be is stopping us from saying, I'm not going to Facebook anymore.

314
00:17:50,459 --> 00:17:52,959
Nobody is stopping us.

315
00:17:52,959 --> 00:17:53,999
That's capitalism.

316
00:17:54,125 --> 00:17:58,250
All I'm saying is we have technology.

317
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:01,999
We have this cloud technology that can provide some incredible value.

318
00:18:03,751 --> 00:18:08,999
You know, when I first saw a cloud offering, I couldn't believe it.

319
00:18:08,999 --> 00:18:11,375
I said, why even try to compete?

320
00:18:11,375 --> 00:18:12,999
Why to create products or services anymore,

321
00:18:12,999 --> 00:18:16,501
because they're just weak incremental steps.

322
00:18:16,501 --> 00:18:18,083
It is a new way to share a picture.

323
00:18:18,167 --> 00:18:20,709
Now, yeah, great, there's power there, I can you know, you look

324
00:18:20,709 --> 00:18:23,459
at the power of the cloud and the storage and the computing

325
00:18:23,459 --> 00:18:25,999
and it's it's absolutely amazing.

326
00:18:25,999 --> 00:18:29,999
And what I believe we need to do, is just take and tone it back

327
00:18:29,999 --> 00:18:32,667
and make it personal.

328
00:18:32,792 --> 00:18:36,999
We talk about a personal cloud here.

329
00:18:36,999 --> 00:18:42,125
Just imagine a personal cloud is all the power of a cloud for you.

330
00:18:42,459 --> 00:18:49,292
So now you have that unbelievable computing power at your fingertips.

331
00:18:49,292 --> 00:18:52,083
You know, and we a lot of us have already seen this.

332
00:18:52,125 --> 00:18:56,292
We understand, but it's about getting people behind it.

333
00:18:56,292 --> 00:18:58,999
We are thought leaders these days.

334
00:18:58,999 --> 00:18:59,999
You know?

335
00:18:59,999 --> 00:19:03,459
Geeks used to not be thought leaders, right?

336
00:19:03,459 --> 00:19:04,459
Now we are.

337
00:19:04,459 --> 00:19:09,876
Now we dictate what comes, what happens, you know, smartphones,

338
00:19:09,876 --> 00:19:15,918
50% US adoption of the smartphone in five years.

339
00:19:15,918 --> 00:19:16,918
That's amazing.

340
00:19:16,999 --> 00:19:17,999
We did that.

341
00:19:17,999 --> 00:19:19,999
Not corporations.

342
00:19:19,999 --> 00:19:20,999
It was people.

343
00:19:21,083 --> 00:19:25,667
So if we concentrate on taking our data and owning it,

344
00:19:25,667 --> 00:19:30,459
through any means, such a person such as a personal cloud,

345
00:19:30,459 --> 00:19:36,999
we can start to really look at what our intentions are, excuse me.

346
00:19:36,999 --> 00:19:38,501
What our intentions are and what our attention

347
00:19:38,501 --> 00:19:41,375
is and how we move things forward.

348
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:48,375
So this personal cloud, if you think about it,

349
00:19:48,375 --> 00:19:55,125
from the perspective of communication, is a great is a great introduction

350
00:19:55,125 --> 00:19:58,167
to the personal cloud.

351
00:19:58,167 --> 00:20:02,292
When a telemarketer calls me, instead of getting my phone, Twilio

352
00:20:02,292 --> 00:20:06,999
will route it to my personal cloud and it will say, geez, look it

353
00:20:06,999 --> 00:20:09,959
up in my contact list and say this person

354
00:20:09,959 --> 00:20:12,250
is not known by you.

355
00:20:12,459 --> 00:20:16,584
And when that happens, I haven't been notified yet.

356
00:20:16,584 --> 00:20:18,709
There's no need for me to be notified yet.

357
00:20:18,999 --> 00:20:22,292
My personal cloud handles it and it immediately puts this person

358
00:20:22,292 --> 00:20:24,834
into a queue that says if you are willing

359
00:20:24,834 --> 00:20:28,999
to if you are interested in talking to Todd, he's available and his time

360
00:20:28,999 --> 00:20:33,459
is worth $15 a minute and here's the credit card account.

361
00:20:33,626 --> 00:20:39,584
So the information can be taken and I get paid for my time.

362
00:20:41,751 --> 00:20:44,334
It doesn't matter what that attention is.

363
00:20:44,334 --> 00:20:47,292
I gave an example of a phone call as being a way

364
00:20:47,292 --> 00:20:50,999
to put our attention on something.

365
00:20:50,999 --> 00:20:52,709
But it's anything.

366
00:20:52,999 --> 00:20:54,626
It's a it's YouTube.

367
00:20:54,626 --> 00:20:57,999
Like, why do we get interrupted with commercials?

368
00:20:58,292 --> 00:21:01,083
That's so it just doesn't even make sense.

369
00:21:01,083 --> 00:21:03,834
Like you irritate the consumer, the advertiser doesn't get their value

370
00:21:03,834 --> 00:21:05,209
out of it.

371
00:21:05,209 --> 00:21:07,999
Just show 'em all to me at one time.

372
00:21:07,999 --> 00:21:09,626
I don't need to be interrupted.

373
00:21:09,626 --> 00:21:13,125
These things are you know, this is us taking back our attention.

374
00:21:13,125 --> 00:21:16,083
This is us putting forth better technology

375
00:21:16,083 --> 00:21:19,999
for people, for corporations, to still compete,

376
00:21:19,999 --> 00:21:26,083
but we slowly grab back some of this attention and intention.

377
00:21:27,083 --> 00:21:32,999
Intention is very powerful, because if we knew what everybody

378
00:21:32,999 --> 00:21:37,834
wants and needs, that's their intention.

379
00:21:37,834 --> 00:21:39,501
If we knew what we wanted and needed we could deliver on it

380
00:21:39,501 --> 00:21:41,876
and we can deliver on it in a much better way than

381
00:21:41,876 --> 00:21:44,459
the market currently delivers on it.

382
00:21:44,667 --> 00:21:48,999
These companies guessing at what we need and these companies

383
00:21:48,999 --> 00:21:52,959
competing to create products that are ultimately

384
00:21:52,959 --> 00:21:58,751
the same, but they're all terrible, because one has got the best screen,

385
00:21:58,751 --> 00:22:04,334
one's got the best keyboard, one's got the best radio, and in the end,

386
00:22:04,334 --> 00:22:07,125
you don't have a full solid product

387
00:22:07,125 --> 00:22:14,417
because you have ten genius scientists trying to create the next best screen.

388
00:22:14,501 --> 00:22:16,542
All competing against each other.

389
00:22:16,542 --> 00:22:20,999
None of them sharing any of their information, and then

390
00:22:20,999 --> 00:22:26,999
the winner these genius scientists have to go off and figure

391
00:22:26,999 --> 00:22:31,999
out different ways to solve the problem.

392
00:22:32,667 --> 00:22:36,709
That doesn't sound like innovation to me.

393
00:22:36,709 --> 00:22:38,709
That sounds like inefficiency.

394
00:22:38,709 --> 00:22:42,250
And what I'm saying is if we just need one screen.

395
00:22:42,751 --> 00:22:45,834
I don't need one screen for a smartphone, one screen

396
00:22:45,834 --> 00:22:47,959
for whatever it is.

397
00:22:48,083 --> 00:22:49,751
I don't need any more than that.

398
00:22:49,751 --> 00:22:53,083
But corporations, you know, through patents and trademarks,

399
00:22:53,083 --> 00:22:56,999
they have to they have to do it this way.

400
00:22:56,999 --> 00:22:58,209
This is the game they play.

401
00:22:58,209 --> 00:22:59,209
Right?

402
00:22:59,209 --> 00:23:01,167
And I'm just saying, enough is enough.

403
00:23:01,626 --> 00:23:03,167
We're sick of playing your game.

404
00:23:03,167 --> 00:23:04,167
It's not fun.

405
00:23:04,167 --> 00:23:05,584
It creates problems.

406
00:23:05,584 --> 00:23:11,876
If you look at the problems of people, you have simple things.

407
00:23:11,876 --> 00:23:13,876
When you look at the problems that corporations

408
00:23:13,876 --> 00:23:16,999
and governments create, this is war!

409
00:23:16,999 --> 00:23:18,709
This is genocide.

410
00:23:18,834 --> 00:23:20,751
This is terrorism!

411
00:23:21,083 --> 00:23:23,959
These are not nice problems and these are problems that we

412
00:23:23,959 --> 00:23:27,501
as people inherit from systems that we created.

413
00:23:27,999 --> 00:23:30,792
It doesn't make any sense to me.

414
00:23:30,959 --> 00:23:34,918
I mean, maybe I'm nuts but, you know, I'm here talking to you people

415
00:23:34,918 --> 00:23:39,626
because this again, you are the thought leaders out here.

416
00:23:39,626 --> 00:23:41,542
You are the people that are going to take these messages back

417
00:23:41,542 --> 00:23:44,999
to your friends and to your family and pass it along.

418
00:23:44,999 --> 00:23:46,584
We are trying to do something.

419
00:23:46,584 --> 00:23:48,375
At MadeOpen.com, what we are trying to do

420
00:23:48,375 --> 00:23:51,667
is we are trying MadeOpen.com is me.

421
00:23:51,999 --> 00:23:53,417
It's one person.

422
00:23:53,542 --> 00:23:56,375
And I'm not afraid to admit it and I work for you.

423
00:23:57,417 --> 00:23:58,876
That's it.

424
00:23:58,876 --> 00:23:59,999
Who else works for you?

425
00:23:59,999 --> 00:24:03,999
I'm trying to figure out what point out into the future we need to get to,

426
00:24:03,999 --> 00:24:06,209
and I want feedback.

427
00:24:06,209 --> 00:24:07,250
This is why I'm here.

428
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:11,292
I'm trying to figure out where we get to, and then how we get there.

429
00:24:11,292 --> 00:24:14,250
And then within my lifetime, make as much progress as I can

430
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:18,626
to that end because then at least this way, I can tell my kids, hey,

431
00:24:18,626 --> 00:24:20,083
I tried.

432
00:24:20,083 --> 00:24:21,083
Right?

433
00:24:21,501 --> 00:24:23,999
Sorry, the world sucks but I tried.

434
00:24:23,999 --> 00:24:27,083
I didn't just, you know, do what a lot of people do, go to work every day

435
00:24:27,083 --> 00:24:29,584
and hope things get better.

436
00:24:29,584 --> 00:24:31,876
Hope somebody is out there working for me.

437
00:24:31,959 --> 00:24:34,667
So I'm looking for people to work with me.

438
00:24:34,834 --> 00:24:38,417
I'm looking for ideas and I and it's not over.

439
00:24:38,501 --> 00:24:41,250
I want to talk a little bit more about the personal cloud and what

440
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:44,167
the benefits of that, because I believe that fundamentally,

441
00:24:44,167 --> 00:24:47,751
I'm here to talk about the direction and I believe the personal cloud

442
00:24:47,751 --> 00:24:50,792
is the first way in which we change that.

443
00:24:50,834 --> 00:24:54,167
Because, again, with a personal cloud, that's your data.

444
00:24:54,167 --> 00:24:55,250
That's your control.

445
00:24:55,250 --> 00:24:56,501
So we just solved the problem of privacy,

446
00:24:56,501 --> 00:25:00,999
by instituting one simple technology so that you can put all of your stuff

447
00:25:00,999 --> 00:25:04,542
in one place, see it how you want to see it.

448
00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:08,334
So I will give a couple of examples of what we can do

449
00:25:08,334 --> 00:25:10,626
with a personal cloud.

450
00:25:13,709 --> 00:25:15,959
First of all, I believe security becomes

451
00:25:15,959 --> 00:25:17,999
a much easier issue.

452
00:25:18,417 --> 00:25:21,375
If somebody at Facebook tries to log into ten times into my account,

453
00:25:21,375 --> 00:25:23,334
guessing passwords.

454
00:25:23,417 --> 00:25:27,459
I don't know what Facebook's policy is, but I know what my policy

455
00:25:27,459 --> 00:25:31,250
is and I know what your policy would be.

456
00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:34,292
And that's more important than what anybody else's policy S.

457
00:25:34,292 --> 00:25:38,792
as soon as you start controlling your data you make these decisions.

458
00:25:38,792 --> 00:25:41,709
You control what happens when somebody comes in.

459
00:25:41,999 --> 00:25:43,501
To your personal cloud.

460
00:25:43,584 --> 00:25:44,876
Right?

461
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:48,083
And this is a personal cloud, it's just an abstract idea.

462
00:25:48,083 --> 00:25:49,709
There's people abstract idea.

463
00:25:50,751 --> 00:25:55,626
It's an abstract idea of sharing stuff.

464
00:25:55,834 --> 00:25:58,459
You have four data types.

465
00:25:58,959 --> 00:26:01,083
And all of these services, they're spread

466
00:26:01,083 --> 00:26:05,709
across and that right there, you know this whole API revolution we

467
00:26:05,709 --> 00:26:08,667
are seeing, it's not because companies want

468
00:26:08,667 --> 00:26:13,250
to share their data, right, their data, not your data.

469
00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:16,501
They don't want to share their data with their competition.

470
00:26:16,999 --> 00:26:20,959
These are grown men, who can't make an agreement.

471
00:26:20,999 --> 00:26:21,999
Right?

472
00:26:21,999 --> 00:26:24,125
These are it's crazy, but it's the world we live in,

473
00:26:24,125 --> 00:26:28,584
and these APIs are supposed to give us more access.

474
00:26:28,751 --> 00:26:32,083
It's neat because, yes, we can do some cool stuff.

475
00:26:32,083 --> 00:26:34,083
What if it was in one place.

476
00:26:34,083 --> 00:26:38,292
What if all of your data set in one location?

477
00:26:38,292 --> 00:26:39,999
What could you do with it then?

478
00:26:40,417 --> 00:26:43,918
You could do some amazing things because now all of your data can talk

479
00:26:43,918 --> 00:26:46,999
to each other and it's not about today.

480
00:26:47,083 --> 00:26:49,834
You know, today we live in this moment, where we think, wow,

481
00:26:49,834 --> 00:26:53,417
look at all of this data we are collecting, right?

482
00:26:53,417 --> 00:26:56,626
The location data, you know, movement data, it's it's going

483
00:26:56,626 --> 00:27:00,083
to get smaller and smaller where it's medical data,

484
00:27:00,083 --> 00:27:03,959
and embedded devices and wearable devices and when this

485
00:27:03,959 --> 00:27:09,250
happens, and we're collecting more and more data, what's enough?

486
00:27:09,751 --> 00:27:10,751
You know?

487
00:27:10,751 --> 00:27:13,751
How can we make that data intelligently talk to each other?

488
00:27:13,751 --> 00:27:15,375
You know, home automation, devices within home automation,

489
00:27:15,375 --> 00:27:17,999
not being able to control those.

490
00:27:18,417 --> 00:27:21,542
At what point do we get control back?

491
00:27:21,542 --> 00:27:23,459
Well, it's when the market demands it.

492
00:27:23,459 --> 00:27:26,250
It's when somebody puts something um on a crowd funding site

493
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:30,959
to get funding to create something that's open source.

494
00:27:31,083 --> 00:27:34,375
I'm saying, let's make everything open, right?

495
00:27:34,375 --> 00:27:36,292
It's not about this initiative with government

496
00:27:36,292 --> 00:27:38,959
to make open government.

497
00:27:38,959 --> 00:27:40,083
It doesn't make any sense.

498
00:27:40,083 --> 00:27:42,209
They are just opening up more of our data.

499
00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:45,292
That's not beneficial to us necessarily.

500
00:27:45,292 --> 00:27:47,334
The corporations I'm sure are loving it.

501
00:27:47,334 --> 00:27:49,250
But it's not for us.

502
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:53,834
When I say open, I mean control your date first.

503
00:27:53,834 --> 00:27:55,334
Own your data first.

504
00:27:55,918 --> 00:27:57,459
Then share it.

505
00:27:57,459 --> 00:27:58,667
Then open it.

506
00:27:58,667 --> 00:27:59,667
Right?

507
00:27:59,667 --> 00:28:00,999
Then give it to who you want.

508
00:28:00,999 --> 00:28:04,375
Because I for one am willing to share everything

509
00:28:04,375 --> 00:28:10,334
about myself anonymously to research groups, who are trying

510
00:28:10,334 --> 00:28:15,999
to solve big problems, like cancer, diabetes.

511
00:28:16,334 --> 00:28:21,083
Let's I'm willing to tell people what I eat, what my and what my pulse

512
00:28:21,083 --> 00:28:25,501
is at any given time, all of my vitals anonymously.

513
00:28:25,751 --> 00:28:28,667
Imagine what that graph looks like.

514
00:28:29,792 --> 00:28:32,999
That's what we will be dealing with in a few years.

515
00:28:32,999 --> 00:28:34,999
This is not something that's not coming.

516
00:28:35,542 --> 00:28:37,292
This is certainly coming.

517
00:28:37,334 --> 00:28:40,751
So all I want to do is look out there and say, how are we going

518
00:28:40,751 --> 00:28:43,792
to manage this when we get there?

519
00:28:43,792 --> 00:28:45,999
How will we manage this amount of data?

520
00:28:46,083 --> 00:28:50,999
How do we take our attention and intention and start to use it

521
00:28:50,999 --> 00:28:55,501
in a way that benefits us instead of them?

522
00:28:55,999 --> 00:28:58,999
And I believe if we put options in front of people,

523
00:28:58,999 --> 00:29:03,751
who know what these things are that I'm talking about, again, this

524
00:29:03,751 --> 00:29:08,792
is very little education to take back to your loved ones.

525
00:29:08,959 --> 00:29:10,125
Four data types.

526
00:29:10,125 --> 00:29:12,876
Why are we sharing so much with so many different people when we

527
00:29:12,876 --> 00:29:15,501
only have four things we share?

528
00:29:15,501 --> 00:29:17,999
Why don't I have one application for pictures?

529
00:29:18,999 --> 00:29:21,792
And then the three tenses, to actually think, what

530
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:24,999
is this data that we are talking about.

531
00:29:25,292 --> 00:29:28,999
Why do we think of video images, audio and text,

532
00:29:28,999 --> 00:29:34,083
and why done we think about attention and intention.

533
00:29:34,167 --> 00:29:36,834
Where is the privacy policy talk on that.

534
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:41,999
If we focus on growing something that can manage

535
00:29:41,999 --> 00:29:46,918
your attention and your intention, through data ownership, such

536
00:29:46,918 --> 00:29:50,626
as a personal cloud, then what you do is you have

537
00:29:50,626 --> 00:29:54,709
the power of your data at your disposal.

538
00:29:54,959 --> 00:29:57,999
You can run applications within your own personal cloud,

539
00:29:57,999 --> 00:30:01,209
not let anything out, you know, these are again,

540
00:30:01,209 --> 00:30:04,250
smartphone adoption five years.

541
00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:06,083
We can do the same thing we did with smartphones, we can do

542
00:30:06,083 --> 00:30:08,083
with personal clouds.

543
00:30:08,083 --> 00:30:09,584
We have the technology.

544
00:30:09,584 --> 00:30:10,584
It's available.

545
00:30:10,584 --> 00:30:11,584
You know?

546
00:30:11,584 --> 00:30:14,542
So what I'm trying to do is get people behind this movement,

547
00:30:14,542 --> 00:30:18,125
get people at Made Open talking about this.

548
00:30:18,125 --> 00:30:19,999
I'm going to be much more active leading

549
00:30:19,999 --> 00:30:23,626
up to this, I have been doing a lot of work.

550
00:30:23,626 --> 00:30:27,167
So I haven't been as active on that and the Twitter account but it's

551
00:30:27,167 --> 00:30:31,083
at MadeOpen.com or at Made Open and what better than using

552
00:30:31,083 --> 00:30:34,959
the social networks to their own demise.

553
00:30:34,959 --> 00:30:38,459
Let's organize through the resources we have

554
00:30:38,459 --> 00:30:45,751
and organize the slow, dismantling of these corporations, right?

555
00:30:45,751 --> 00:30:48,999
So that we as people can step out and live our lives and not have

556
00:30:48,999 --> 00:30:53,292
to deal with these measures, these unnatural pressures that we deal

557
00:30:53,292 --> 00:30:57,292
with, that make people break, that create this overpopulation

558
00:30:57,292 --> 00:30:59,250
in our prisons.

559
00:30:59,999 --> 00:31:04,542
And let's fix the efficiencies of these corporations, you know,

560
00:31:04,542 --> 00:31:08,083
that over population of prisons is a great example

561
00:31:08,083 --> 00:31:11,709
of where corporations and governments is a system

562
00:31:11,709 --> 00:31:15,459
not only failed but they leave you believing how this

563
00:31:15,459 --> 00:31:17,667
happened, right?

564
00:31:17,667 --> 00:31:22,250
How was it that we have a system, a penal system where we incarcerate

565
00:31:22,250 --> 00:31:25,918
people and it's not profitable.

566
00:31:25,918 --> 00:31:27,584
So the market can't take care of it.

567
00:31:27,584 --> 00:31:29,999
So government comes in and says we will take care of it,

568
00:31:29,999 --> 00:31:33,792
and at some point, government says, we can't do this as efficiently

569
00:31:33,792 --> 00:31:37,292
as a corporation, so let the corporation do it.

570
00:31:37,292 --> 00:31:42,999
So something that wasn't profitable, all of a sudden became profitable.

571
00:31:43,999 --> 00:31:47,959
That's not even in my mind, it's not even possible.

572
00:31:47,959 --> 00:31:49,959
Something happened, right?

573
00:31:49,959 --> 00:31:51,792
Some numbers were changed.

574
00:31:51,834 --> 00:31:52,999
Something happened.

575
00:31:52,999 --> 00:31:55,125
And this is happening all around us.

576
00:31:55,125 --> 00:31:57,709
You don't need to look far to get an example.

577
00:32:08,334 --> 00:32:10,250
So the personal cloud.

578
00:32:11,542 --> 00:32:15,834
There's a group at that meets out in Mountainview, California,

579
00:32:15,834 --> 00:32:19,999
called IIW and there's a big group of people that are working

580
00:32:19,999 --> 00:32:24,999
on this personal cloud, and I would, you know, implore you to take a look

581
00:32:24,999 --> 00:32:29,083
at what they are doing, search about personal clouds and start

582
00:32:29,083 --> 00:32:32,999
to become active members of this new community that we're

583
00:32:32,999 --> 00:32:36,209
starting to form, where we're actually concerned

584
00:32:36,209 --> 00:32:38,999
about where we are going.

585
00:32:39,334 --> 00:32:41,959
And that's what Made Open is.

586
00:32:41,999 --> 00:32:46,751
So I don't really have too much more that I have prepared to say.

587
00:32:46,751 --> 00:32:49,584
So I would like questions and feedback.

588
00:32:50,083 --> 00:32:52,918
That's what I would really like to open it up and do.

589
00:32:54,999 --> 00:32:56,417
Anybody?

590
00:32:56,751 --> 00:32:58,751
Yes, sir?

591
00:32:58,999 --> 00:33:02,501
AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Inaudible).

592
00:33:02,834 --> 00:33:05,792
TODD BONNEWELL: Well, I'm just one person.

593
00:33:06,083 --> 00:33:09,959
If you think about I mean, technically, I don't know if you are a developer

594
00:33:09,959 --> 00:33:11,999
or not, sir, but the question was how much

595
00:33:11,999 --> 00:33:14,542
of this personal cloud is done?

596
00:33:14,751 --> 00:33:16,999
And there's a bunch of people working on it.

597
00:33:16,999 --> 00:33:19,999
They have been working on it for six or seven years at IIW.

598
00:33:21,083 --> 00:33:25,125
The interesting thing when you sit in these sessions,

599
00:33:25,125 --> 00:33:30,167
you can tell it's they're guided by principles that you are happy

600
00:33:30,167 --> 00:33:34,667
to hear about, right, liberating people's data but almost

601
00:33:34,667 --> 00:33:37,584
the next questions out of their mouths

602
00:33:37,584 --> 00:33:40,375
is how do we make money?

603
00:33:40,751 --> 00:33:44,626
And that's where it's lost on somebody.

604
00:33:44,626 --> 00:33:48,083
That's where you can't make progress because you are still trying to figure

605
00:33:48,083 --> 00:33:52,125
out how do we give this personal cloud to somebody in its entirety so

606
00:33:52,125 --> 00:33:56,083
they can own their data, yet we still control it.

607
00:33:56,999 --> 00:33:58,334
And you can't.

608
00:33:58,334 --> 00:34:00,209
And it doesn't fit a business.

609
00:34:00,209 --> 00:34:01,999
It's not today fit a business model.

610
00:34:01,999 --> 00:34:03,125
This is for the people.

611
00:34:03,125 --> 00:34:04,125
Right?

612
00:34:04,125 --> 00:34:05,834
This is something we need several open source versions

613
00:34:05,834 --> 00:34:10,709
of personal clouds where people are working on a platform, to do this.

614
00:34:10,709 --> 00:34:14,584
And it doesn't take a lot to create a simple personal cloud.

615
00:34:14,584 --> 00:34:16,876
If you look at what you know, AWS, for example, what

616
00:34:16,876 --> 00:34:19,584
they are giving us is tools.

617
00:34:19,999 --> 00:34:23,417
Now, the setup process isn't easy but this is what we are used to.

618
00:34:23,417 --> 00:34:24,999
This is you know, we can't just tell people, here,

619
00:34:24,999 --> 00:34:26,999
install this software.

620
00:34:26,999 --> 00:34:30,542
Go to AWS, set up an account and here's how you upload.

621
00:34:30,999 --> 00:34:33,999
Here's how you manage your settings and all of that.

622
00:34:33,999 --> 00:34:35,083
It's not going to work.

623
00:34:35,083 --> 00:34:36,876
That's not a commercial product.

624
00:34:36,876 --> 00:34:37,999
We need to create a commercial product,

625
00:34:37,999 --> 00:34:40,125
but that always starts here.

626
00:34:40,125 --> 00:34:43,709
You know, what is Dropbox, but FTP, right?

627
00:34:43,709 --> 00:34:45,918
We do these things over and over and over again,

628
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:50,959
until the point when one of us figures out to make money with it.

629
00:34:50,959 --> 00:34:54,292
It's always simplifying so the user can manage it.

630
00:34:54,999 --> 00:34:58,209
We need to grab on to this thing called a personal cloud.

631
00:34:58,501 --> 00:35:00,834
I'm sure a lot of people are already doing something

632
00:35:00,834 --> 00:35:05,083
similar to it, but the point is to share, how are you protecting your data?

633
00:35:05,083 --> 00:35:06,834
How are you encrypting it?

634
00:35:06,834 --> 00:35:08,792
What level of privacy can we expect when it

635
00:35:08,792 --> 00:35:13,209
ultimately gets to somewhere else, when we decide that we don't you know

636
00:35:13,209 --> 00:35:15,999
when I make the decision that I don't need

637
00:35:15,999 --> 00:35:20,083
to own my data the same way that somebody else does.

638
00:35:20,083 --> 00:35:21,999
You know, and I'm willing to say, okay, you know what,

639
00:35:21,999 --> 00:35:25,542
Amazon can have that and I'm not going to encrypt it.

640
00:35:25,542 --> 00:35:26,876
It is not that important.

641
00:35:26,876 --> 00:35:30,876
Or I encrypt it and lock it in a closet in my house.

642
00:35:30,876 --> 00:35:31,876
Right?

643
00:35:31,876 --> 00:35:32,876
But it's up to you.

644
00:35:32,876 --> 00:35:34,999
Your personal cloud is your personal cloud.

645
00:35:34,999 --> 00:35:35,999
It's your data.

646
00:35:35,999 --> 00:35:37,999
And so to answer your question, there's it's there's progress,

647
00:35:37,999 --> 00:35:41,918
but it's more important that just like with a personal computer, it's

648
00:35:41,918 --> 00:35:45,083
like there's a computer and it's in a room, and it's huge,

649
00:35:45,083 --> 00:35:47,792
and now it's many our pocket.

650
00:35:47,792 --> 00:35:50,083
You know, the same thing with a personal cloud.

651
00:35:50,083 --> 00:35:51,083
The idea is huge.

652
00:35:51,501 --> 00:35:52,876
We're doing it, though.

653
00:35:52,876 --> 00:35:54,334
You know, this is it's not new.

654
00:35:54,334 --> 00:35:57,584
So the idea is to take that and put it in our pocket.

655
00:36:03,083 --> 00:36:06,459
AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Inaudible question)    TODD BONNEWELL:

656
00:36:06,459 --> 00:36:10,542
When you look at these products, you want to look at what the limations,

657
00:36:10,542 --> 00:36:13,999
who is owning your data and move from there.

658
00:36:13,999 --> 00:36:16,334
They will put putting all of our data in one place, this

659
00:36:16,334 --> 00:36:21,751
is where we are going as a people, like, we need to get our data in one place.

660
00:36:21,751 --> 00:36:24,501
The question is: Who are we going to trust with it?

661
00:36:24,501 --> 00:36:27,459
AUDIENCE MEMBER: There are products like home cloud and spider

662
00:36:27,459 --> 00:36:29,250
is more secure.

663
00:36:29,250 --> 00:36:31,999
We understand what they are doing but it's important

664
00:36:31,999 --> 00:36:36,834
to understand that there's more than just personal data.

665
00:36:36,834 --> 00:36:39,292
There's data that rainfall data, pollution data.

666
00:36:39,292 --> 00:36:44,125
So we don't own that and that's okay.

667
00:36:49,999 --> 00:36:51,167
So we've got to be able to use that data and this

668
00:36:51,167 --> 00:36:53,292
is where big data products are coming in.

669
00:36:53,292 --> 00:36:54,417
There is public utility right now it's just been used, you know

670
00:36:54,417 --> 00:36:56,999
to sell more products and there are companies like spelunk that are using it

671
00:36:56,999 --> 00:36:58,501
to send us ads.

672
00:36:58,501 --> 00:37:07,083
I appreciate what you are saying with personal data.

673
00:37:07,083 --> 00:37:08,542
There's a lot more than that.

674
00:37:08,542 --> 00:37:12,709
For example, if I die, many I data I no longer can set rules

675
00:37:12,709 --> 00:37:16,999
for it, but that's history, right?

676
00:37:16,999 --> 00:37:19,250
We need to figure out ways to mine historical data, personal data,

677
00:37:19,250 --> 00:37:21,999
social data, in ways using the new technologies that are

678
00:37:21,999 --> 00:37:23,542
coming out.

679
00:37:23,542 --> 00:37:24,792
TODD BONNEWELL: Yep.

680
00:37:24,792 --> 00:37:25,584
AUDIENCE MEMBER: To get somewhere and we need

681
00:37:25,584 --> 00:37:27,959
to have efficiencies.

682
00:37:28,125 --> 00:37:31,501
TODD BONNEWELL: Right.

683
00:37:31,501 --> 00:37:36,083
So if I can sum that question up, touched on there being public data that

684
00:37:36,083 --> 00:37:41,999
we need to think about and I agree, that it's not all personal, but ultimately,

685
00:37:41,999 --> 00:37:44,792
it's collected by people.

686
00:37:44,999 --> 00:37:47,959
So there was that, and then can you sum

687
00:37:47,959 --> 00:37:51,083
up the second part, I'm sorry?

688
00:37:51,083 --> 00:37:52,083
Can you sum it up?

689
00:37:52,083 --> 00:37:57,459
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I was saying, in addition, there's also data that comes

690
00:37:57,459 --> 00:38:03,999
that we as a society could use, such as pollution data, or rainfall data,

691
00:38:03,999 --> 00:38:08,584
and we've got to be there are now new technologies

692
00:38:08,584 --> 00:38:14,876
like hedging and map produce that try to make sense of it.

693
00:38:14,876 --> 00:38:16,999
That static data is also with spelunk that is taking data

694
00:38:16,999 --> 00:38:19,501
in motion so when we use with our smartphones,

695
00:38:19,501 --> 00:38:23,959
it's using that traffic they are bidding on sending you an ad.

696
00:38:23,999 --> 00:38:26,501
TODD BONNEWELL: Right.

697
00:38:26,501 --> 00:38:27,501
Okay.

698
00:38:27,501 --> 00:38:29,125
AUDIENCE MEMBER: So they can use that and turn it

699
00:38:29,125 --> 00:38:33,876
around for the use of people to make owe site more efficient.

700
00:38:33,876 --> 00:38:37,626
I mean, people are doing that right now with with trying to map cancer.

701
00:38:37,626 --> 00:38:40,417
TODD BONNEWELL: So taking that data and making things more efficient

702
00:38:40,417 --> 00:38:42,709
through its use, right?

703
00:38:42,792 --> 00:38:48,292
Yeah, absolutely and that public data that exists out there, that's ours.

704
00:38:48,292 --> 00:38:51,417
You know, and that's it's really not ours right now.

705
00:38:51,417 --> 00:38:55,334
Like, it's not well, it is I mean, it is individual because where else

706
00:38:55,334 --> 00:38:59,459
is the weather or whatever relevant, but to me, where I am,

707
00:38:59,459 --> 00:39:02,751
or where I intend to be or where I know people

708
00:39:02,751 --> 00:39:06,125
to be that I'm interested in, right?

709
00:39:06,209 --> 00:39:09,501
It's all the personal you know, without people on this planet,

710
00:39:09,501 --> 00:39:13,584
the rainfall does not get, you know, calculated and, you know, like,

711
00:39:13,584 --> 00:39:16,999
historically saved and it is what it is.

712
00:39:19,709 --> 00:39:21,751
We have the intention to leave our house tomorrow

713
00:39:21,751 --> 00:39:23,626
if it's going to rain.

714
00:39:23,626 --> 00:39:27,167
But, you know, some of us don't care if it rains.

715
00:39:27,167 --> 00:39:32,834
So public data, again, it's what is necessary for you?

716
00:39:32,834 --> 00:39:35,167
And there's always that need for for us to have some kind of system,

717
00:39:35,167 --> 00:39:38,209
but, again, it's a system of the people.

718
00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:40,834
You know, it's a system where you control that data,

719
00:39:40,834 --> 00:39:43,667
where you hold on to that and do what you see fit

720
00:39:43,667 --> 00:39:45,083
with it.

721
00:39:45,083 --> 00:39:46,584
You know, I believe we're owed these things just

722
00:39:46,584 --> 00:39:48,375
for being alive.

723
00:39:48,375 --> 00:39:51,834
What is more amazing than life on this planet.

724
00:39:51,999 --> 00:39:55,083
We are spinning on this rock, and we are fighting

725
00:39:55,083 --> 00:39:57,999
with each other over money.

726
00:39:58,334 --> 00:40:00,792
Like, all just things that we created.

727
00:40:00,792 --> 00:40:06,999
So, you know, just trying to organize some troops here.

728
00:40:08,125 --> 00:40:09,959
Any other questions?

729
00:40:11,999 --> 00:40:13,375
Good.

730
00:40:15,584 --> 00:40:17,083
All right.

731
00:40:17,083 --> 00:40:18,918
I appreciate your time.

732
00:40:18,999 --> 00:40:21,250
Thanks for having me at DEF CON.

733
00:40:21,250 --> 00:40:23,584
It's been a great first time and I look forward to talking

734
00:40:23,584 --> 00:40:25,999
with you out in the hall.

735
00:40:25,999 --> 00:40:26,999
(Applause).

736
00:40:26,999 --> 00:40:27,999
Thank you.

737
00:40:27,999 --> 00:40:27,999
So to let everybody know, the schedule that is printed,

738
00:40:27,999 --> 00:40:28,999
totally wrong!

739
00:40:28,999 --> 00:40:28,999
If you want to know what is actually going on in most

740
00:40:28,999 --> 00:40:31,292
of the talk rooms, go to updates.DEFCON.org.

741
00:40:31,292 --> 00:40:31,292
And the next talk is "Combatting Mac OSX/IOS,"

742
00:40:31,292 --> 00:40:32,459
with Remy Baumgarten.
