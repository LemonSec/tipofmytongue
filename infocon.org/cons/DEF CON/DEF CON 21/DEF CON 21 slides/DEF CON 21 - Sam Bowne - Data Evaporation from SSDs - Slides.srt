1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,334
SAM BOWNE: All right.

2
00:00:01,334 --> 00:00:03,334
I think it's time to go.

3
00:00:03,751 --> 00:00:05,834
All right.

4
00:00:05,834 --> 00:00:07,667
There's the signal I was looking for.

5
00:00:07,667 --> 00:00:12,834
I want to talk about SSD data evaporation.

6
00:00:12,834 --> 00:00:12,959
I'm Sam Bowne and I talk at City College San Francisco

7
00:00:12,959 --> 00:00:14,042
for the moment.

8
00:00:14,042 --> 00:00:17,834
If you have a magnetic hard drive and you write a file on the disk.

9
00:00:20,584 --> 00:00:24,542
And if you reformat the disk, the file remains on the disk.

10
00:00:24,626 --> 00:00:26,209
Computer forensic people love this because you can get information

11
00:00:26,209 --> 00:00:28,999
from perps that they think they deleted this stuff.

12
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:32,000
The only time you get rid of the stuff is when you write on top

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,292
of those sectors where the data was stored.

14
00:00:40,125 --> 00:00:43,125
If you empty the recycle bin, that doesn't do anything.

15
00:00:44,667 --> 00:00:50,042
It makes them available but it doesn't erase the data.

16
00:00:50,667 --> 00:00:53,375
So forensics people have gotten used to a couple

17
00:00:53,375 --> 00:00:57,501
of luxurious things that computer forensics people do that other kinds

18
00:00:57,501 --> 00:00:59,959
of forensic people have.

19
00:00:59,959 --> 00:01:03,667
One, they can recover deleted stuff and they can make an image

20
00:01:03,667 --> 00:01:07,334
of the file and calculate an MD5 hash ands is exactly

21
00:01:07,334 --> 00:01:11,083
the same and then do that forever until the drive has

22
00:01:11,083 --> 00:01:14,459
a mechanical failure or something.

23
00:01:14,709 --> 00:01:17,501
So computer forensic has been a beautifully, clean,

24
00:01:17,501 --> 00:01:20,999
mathematical sense of forensic science and that time

25
00:01:20,999 --> 00:01:23,125
is pretty much over.

26
00:01:23,999 --> 00:01:26,792
Another fun thing is recover deleted data which

27
00:01:26,792 --> 00:01:30,751
is more important for people in computer forensic.

28
00:01:30,999 --> 00:01:33,999
If you have a PC and you want a file back, you can use Recuva

29
00:01:33,999 --> 00:01:37,501
or Disk Drill and it will bring back your deleted files which

30
00:01:37,501 --> 00:01:40,709
is great and there are a bunch of people who make a lot

31
00:01:40,709 --> 00:01:44,999
of money doing this, Drive Savers, it's a great company.

32
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:47,959
They will get your stuff back if your drive fails which

33
00:01:47,959 --> 00:01:50,584
is an enormously fabulous deal.

34
00:01:53,918 --> 00:01:59,751
This is a MacBook Air and your SSDs and they are an ever increasing part

35
00:01:59,751 --> 00:02:01,918
of the market.

36
00:02:02,999 --> 00:02:05,626
And it's something like 40% of all storage will be

37
00:02:05,626 --> 00:02:07,709
on SSDs pretty soon.

38
00:02:07,999 --> 00:02:08,999
I switched to them almost completely

39
00:02:08,999 --> 00:02:10,999
because they are wonderful.

40
00:02:10,999 --> 00:02:11,999
They are fast.

41
00:02:11,999 --> 00:02:14,292
They are designed to save data efficiently

42
00:02:14,292 --> 00:02:17,834
without any regard for remnants.

43
00:02:17,834 --> 00:02:19,501
Remnants is an artifact of the technology,

44
00:02:19,501 --> 00:02:23,999
of magnetic hard drives, SSDs have other constraints.

45
00:02:25,999 --> 00:02:30,375
You cannot erase one page of an SSD.

46
00:02:30,375 --> 00:02:34,584
You have to erase an entire block, which is many pages.

47
00:02:35,792 --> 00:02:37,375
There's many things.

48
00:02:37,375 --> 00:02:40,709
You have to erase an SSD block before you can write on it.

49
00:02:41,083 --> 00:02:43,918
And you can only erase it so many times before you have warn

50
00:02:43,918 --> 00:02:46,375
out the SSD and you break it.

51
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:48,209
So what you have to do, there's firmware,

52
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:51,918
proprietary processes running in the SSD which erase a block

53
00:02:51,918 --> 00:02:55,792
of pages when they decide in their wisdom that that block has had

54
00:02:55,792 --> 00:02:59,999
enough files deleted that what remains doesn't matter very much and it

55
00:02:59,999 --> 00:03:02,584
will move it somewhere else.

56
00:03:02,918 --> 00:03:09,584
So this means that erasure has to happen before you right.

57
00:03:09,584 --> 00:03:11,792
And, in fact, there's a garbage collection process running

58
00:03:11,792 --> 00:03:13,751
in the background, which erases things when

59
00:03:13,751 --> 00:03:15,959
the wisdom of the SSD controller says it's time

60
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:17,542
to erase them.

61
00:03:17,542 --> 00:03:19,999
It forensically wipes them.

62
00:03:19,999 --> 00:03:24,542
If you delete files on an SSD and wait, they really do vanish sometimes,

63
00:03:24,542 --> 00:03:27,334
and sometimes they done.

64
00:03:27,334 --> 00:03:28,417
It gets complicated.

65
00:03:29,918 --> 00:03:32,709
This was called self corrosion, data evaporation seemed

66
00:03:32,709 --> 00:03:34,999
like a better name to me.

67
00:03:34,999 --> 00:03:38,334
Let me do something here, just to get started.

68
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:41,999
Now, if you do the simplest possible test to this,

69
00:03:41,999 --> 00:03:45,999
that would be to just put some stuff on the desktop and that's what I have

70
00:03:45,999 --> 00:03:47,584
done here.

71
00:03:47,751 --> 00:03:51,999
So I have a folder called Spam demo, which is empty, but I deleted

72
00:03:51,999 --> 00:03:55,626
the contents of this folder at 4:05 which is now about half

73
00:03:55,626 --> 00:03:57,334
an hour ago.

74
00:03:57,334 --> 00:04:01,167
And I have another folder here, called Spam 2, which has four files,

75
00:04:01,167 --> 00:04:03,584
each 200 mega bytes.

76
00:04:03,584 --> 00:04:06,292
By the way when you do this you have to have a lot of data.

77
00:04:06,292 --> 00:04:09,125
Make sure you have about a gigabyte of data.

78
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:13,584
Otherwise you won't see any significant data evaporation.

79
00:04:13,709 --> 00:04:17,250
Now I will put it in the recycle bin and empty the trash.

80
00:04:18,834 --> 00:04:21,918
Are you sure you want to permanently erase.

81
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:25,626
We have seen that message and on the magnetic hard drives, it's

82
00:04:25,626 --> 00:04:29,375
a lie but on SSDs not as much of a lie.

83
00:04:29,542 --> 00:04:32,999
Let's run disk drill, which will recover deleted things.

84
00:04:34,125 --> 00:04:40,167
The quick scan is good enough and it will take a minute or two to run.

85
00:04:42,667 --> 00:04:44,959
And we'll see what it finds.

86
00:04:48,876 --> 00:04:51,334
And yeah, I'm impatient enough to go back

87
00:04:51,334 --> 00:04:54,417
to the slides while this happens.

88
00:04:58,167 --> 00:04:59,999
All right.

89
00:05:01,292 --> 00:05:03,999
And here I will just cut ahead to the chase.

90
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:06,459
Did I this many times, sitting early in the morning at Starbucks

91
00:05:06,459 --> 00:05:08,083
a few months ago.

92
00:05:08,459 --> 00:05:11,542
The time it takes to erase the files I that I deleted them, random,

93
00:05:11,542 --> 00:05:13,250
up to an hour.

94
00:05:13,292 --> 00:05:16,292
So the quick scan is finished and let's see what it found.

95
00:05:16,375 --> 00:05:22,792
It sound users, my name, desktop, Spam two.

96
00:05:22,792 --> 00:05:25,125
It found all five files in Spam two, but the ones

97
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:28,751
in the older folder there are all gone.

98
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:30,334
There were five files.

99
00:05:30,334 --> 00:05:30,918
I deleted them half an hour ago and now

100
00:05:30,918 --> 00:05:33,417
they are completely gone and unrecoverable.

101
00:05:33,751 --> 00:05:35,999
That's the essence of this talk right there.

102
00:05:36,209 --> 00:05:41,834
The only remaining interesting fact is how strange and random this is.

103
00:05:41,999 --> 00:05:44,334
So I have all five files there.

104
00:05:44,334 --> 00:05:47,083
I will run this thing again at the end and we will probably see that some are

105
00:05:47,083 --> 00:05:50,501
gone by then, although probably not all of them.

106
00:05:50,584 --> 00:05:52,999
So those are the results and you see frequent result

107
00:05:52,999 --> 00:05:56,999
is it erases some of the files but not all of them and another pass comes

108
00:05:56,999 --> 00:06:00,999
through later, I'm not able to detect any pattern here.

109
00:06:01,083 --> 00:06:03,083
So in the wisdom of the people that made

110
00:06:03,083 --> 00:06:05,999
the controller for the Mac SSD, it can take up to an hour

111
00:06:05,999 --> 00:06:09,999
to complete the garbage collection for items on the desktop.

112
00:06:10,417 --> 00:06:15,375
Now you can run this command and see if it's supporting TRIM.

113
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:20,209
Has to happen with SSDs, that doesn't lap with the magnetic files.

114
00:06:21,959 --> 00:06:26,626
Normally your drive doesn't know when the operating system doesn't know

115
00:06:26,626 --> 00:06:29,083
when you delete a file.

116
00:06:29,999 --> 00:06:32,167
It's only supported by the latest versions

117
00:06:32,167 --> 00:06:35,542
of operating systems and only if you have your drive running

118
00:06:35,542 --> 00:06:37,792
in SATA mode and AHCI.

119
00:06:40,999 --> 00:06:46,083
If you satisfy all of those conditions and you have latest partition format,

120
00:06:46,083 --> 00:06:50,667
then you may observe evaporation, but you can't control the timing

121
00:06:50,667 --> 00:06:53,375
and you can't turn it off.

122
00:06:53,792 --> 00:06:57,459
So here's some more examples, you are running it through USB

123
00:06:57,459 --> 00:07:01,375
and you can't run through PCI express and RAID.

124
00:07:01,667 --> 00:07:03,999
But if you don't break any of those large number

125
00:07:03,999 --> 00:07:06,125
of rules then you will have the phenomenon that

126
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:08,792
the deleted files are vanishing.

127
00:07:14,459 --> 00:07:17,501
You will have to be able to explain what happened here

128
00:07:17,501 --> 00:07:19,999
because it's going to mess up your traditions,

129
00:07:19,999 --> 00:07:23,501
because if you make an image of an SSD and calculate the MD5,

130
00:07:23,501 --> 00:07:26,999
as soon as you put the power on to the SSD even though you have

131
00:07:26,999 --> 00:07:31,250
a hardware write blocker, the data on the SSD is changing.

132
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:33,999
It's evaporating away the data and when you make another

133
00:07:33,999 --> 00:07:37,083
copy, you don't get the same MD5.

134
00:07:37,167 --> 00:07:39,792
So that will make your evidence appear wrong and you will be have

135
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:41,834
to be able to explain this.

136
00:07:42,459 --> 00:07:46,083
When I have took computer forensic classes, my instructors made it very

137
00:07:46,083 --> 00:07:49,417
clear to me, this is true, the reason you are an expert witness

138
00:07:49,417 --> 00:07:52,999
is you are allowed to have opinions but those opinions must be based

139
00:07:52,999 --> 00:07:55,292
on experience not hearsay.

140
00:07:55,751 --> 00:07:57,292
You cannot quote something you read in a book or something that

141
00:07:57,292 --> 00:07:58,999
a teacher gave you.

142
00:07:58,999 --> 00:08:02,999
You have to say, I tested it myself and this is how it works.

143
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:05,209
Therefore you have to have testing tools.

144
00:08:05,209 --> 00:08:05,999
So I made a testing tool to make it easier

145
00:08:05,999 --> 00:08:08,167
because it's obvious to me that people will have to test

146
00:08:08,167 --> 00:08:10,792
the exact drives that they want to testify about if they want

147
00:08:10,792 --> 00:08:12,667
to explain this stuff.

148
00:08:13,375 --> 00:08:15,709
Since it depends on everything.

149
00:08:15,709 --> 00:08:18,584
So let me show you the tool I made to check on the Mac because it's fun

150
00:08:18,584 --> 00:08:20,083
for a demo.

151
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:22,083
I wrote a command line tool called evap.

152
00:08:22,083 --> 00:08:26,959
And I will get my window to come to the front.

153
00:08:27,292 --> 00:08:30,999
Pass this is a Bash shell script, and there's not much to it.

154
00:08:30,999 --> 00:08:33,125
Let me put in a password.

155
00:08:33,334 --> 00:08:35,083
All right.

156
00:08:35,292 --> 00:08:38,459
So it has a few options here.

157
00:08:38,459 --> 00:08:40,375
Now in order to run this tool, now what I did before,

158
00:08:40,375 --> 00:08:44,167
was a demonstration putting a folder on my desktop.

159
00:08:44,334 --> 00:08:48,667
But for this tool, I create a partition just for this purpose.

160
00:08:48,667 --> 00:08:50,999
So I have a 500 gigabyte Apple SSD.

161
00:08:51,999 --> 00:08:54,999
Here's the big one and here's the little one.

162
00:08:54,999 --> 00:08:57,709
I have a 1 gigabyte I created just for testing.

163
00:08:58,999 --> 00:09:00,959
You have to do that because I'm following

164
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:03,876
a 2010 paper that started this and I found something that caught

165
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:05,375
my attention.

166
00:09:06,209 --> 00:09:11,501
If I format that as a journaling HHS plus, with ex, that

167
00:09:11,501 --> 00:09:18,584
will format that partition and then I can write test files on that partition

168
00:09:18,584 --> 00:09:24,667
with W and when I scan it, I'm going to scan the entire partition

169
00:09:24,667 --> 00:09:29,999
and print 80 individual bytes evenly across it.

170
00:09:29,999 --> 00:09:32,918
So you get a sort of overview what's on there and what I did was write

171
00:09:32,918 --> 00:09:35,667
a bunch of files full of ASCII characters so they go

172
00:09:35,667 --> 00:09:39,959
in order and there's a bunch of files on there in this area.

173
00:09:42,876 --> 00:09:46,999
If I scan it again, you see what happens, they are all gone.

174
00:09:47,334 --> 00:09:53,626
Now, if I write them on there again, and scan them, and then delete 'em

175
00:09:53,626 --> 00:09:59,584
and then scan 'em, they are all gone again, which there's a fly

176
00:09:59,584 --> 00:10:02,542
in the ointment here.

177
00:10:02,999 --> 00:10:06,209
I expected I'm frequently able to show you that there's some

178
00:10:06,209 --> 00:10:08,042
of that left.

179
00:10:08,042 --> 00:10:09,667
It didn't really get them all.

180
00:10:09,667 --> 00:10:11,999
And it's kind of a random process.

181
00:10:11,999 --> 00:10:13,501
Sometimes I can see some of those letters left and sometimes

182
00:10:13,501 --> 00:10:14,834
I can't.

183
00:10:14,876 --> 00:10:19,999
But anyway, what's even more fun is to put it in a different format.

184
00:10:19,999 --> 00:10:23,751
If you make it in an older Macintosh format,

185
00:10:23,751 --> 00:10:29,459
the non journaling system with F and then write that data,

186
00:10:29,459 --> 00:10:32,083
and then scan it.

187
00:10:32,375 --> 00:10:33,751
The data is on there.

188
00:10:33,751 --> 00:10:36,999
If you delete that data and then scan it, it's all still there and it

189
00:10:36,999 --> 00:10:41,334
will stay there forever, just like a magnetic hard drive.

190
00:10:41,459 --> 00:10:47,042
So this process is not complete, and it's very hard to predict.

191
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:49,999
And by the way, if you are a crook and you want to not get caught,

192
00:10:49,999 --> 00:10:52,792
you can't trust this evaporation to thoroughly remove

193
00:10:52,792 --> 00:10:55,918
all the data either because some of the data you put in there

194
00:10:55,918 --> 00:10:58,751
will not fill enough of those blocks.

195
00:10:58,751 --> 00:11:01,125
It will decide to leave them and wait until later.

196
00:11:01,125 --> 00:11:03,292
It doesn't erase 100% of the data and I have another format,

197
00:11:03,292 --> 00:11:06,792
some more commands that take a little longer to run where you fill

198
00:11:06,792 --> 00:11:08,999
the entire thing with Xs and then erase it

199
00:11:08,999 --> 00:11:11,834
and then measure how many Xs are left and you will find

200
00:11:11,834 --> 00:11:14,501
a significant number of them left.

201
00:11:14,501 --> 00:11:21,167
So it's an important thing to realize, and that's the main point here.

202
00:11:21,167 --> 00:11:24,250
All right.

203
00:11:24,459 --> 00:11:27,834
Now, I had another demo, which is not going to work.

204
00:11:27,834 --> 00:11:31,334
My SSD has failed, but I want to point out there are two cases here

205
00:11:31,334 --> 00:11:34,375
on the Mac's desktop, it takes up to an hour

206
00:11:34,375 --> 00:11:37,459
for these things to evaporate.

207
00:11:37,459 --> 00:11:40,375
On the separate partition, it takes less than one second.

208
00:11:40,375 --> 00:11:41,999
I can't measure the time at all.

209
00:11:41,999 --> 00:11:45,999
They are instantly, if you buy a Corsair, SSD, it makes 15 seconds which makes

210
00:11:45,999 --> 00:11:49,542
an entertaining demo, you can put them in a hex viewer

211
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:54,083
and watch them and after 15 seconds they just vanish.

212
00:11:55,959 --> 00:11:59,999
So I don't think I can't give you that demo because my SSD just failed

213
00:11:59,999 --> 00:12:03,459
and I think that's all I have to tell you.

214
00:12:03,459 --> 00:12:04,751
Are there any questions?

215
00:12:08,792 --> 00:12:10,083
(Applause).

216
00:12:14,334 --> 00:12:16,751
Well, if I don't have any questions in here, I will hang out in the hallway

217
00:12:16,751 --> 00:12:19,584
to see if anybody wants to hear anything more about this.

218
00:12:19,584 --> 00:12:22,083
AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Inaudible).

219
00:12:22,083 --> 00:12:24,667
SAM BOWNE: What's that?

220
00:12:26,999 --> 00:12:29,459
AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Inaudible).

221
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:34,584
SAM BOWNE: Immigration.

222
00:12:36,709 --> 00:12:39,459
(Laughter) I'm sorry, I can't hear the question.

223
00:12:41,417 --> 00:12:43,792
I'm sorry, I still can't hear the question.

224
00:12:43,792 --> 00:12:44,999
Why don't you come up here.

225
00:12:48,334 --> 00:12:54,999
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Is this true just for MLC drives not SLC.

226
00:13:03,292 --> 00:13:05,083
SAM BOWNE: I do not know.

227
00:13:05,083 --> 00:13:08,501
Let me run this drill again and see if anything has happened there.

228
00:13:08,501 --> 00:13:10,417
I don't think it's been long enough.

229
00:13:11,999 --> 00:13:14,125
Let's try this again and see what happens.

230
00:13:22,999 --> 00:13:24,667
Anyway, you had something?

231
00:13:25,999 --> 00:13:27,834
AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Inaudible).

232
00:13:27,834 --> 00:13:31,083
SAM BOWNE: Secure erase is just writing on top of the data, right?

233
00:13:31,083 --> 00:13:32,250
No, it doesn't.

234
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:36,999
A security base will not erase an SSD, because SSDs have extra bytes.

235
00:13:36,999 --> 00:13:39,667
If you buy 100 gig SSD, you really get 110 or 115 and

236
00:13:39,667 --> 00:13:43,918
the sectors are incredibly mapped by the controller.

237
00:13:43,918 --> 00:13:46,918
So when you erase them, you never get the whole thing

238
00:13:46,918 --> 00:13:51,626
and there's no tool that will erase the entire contents.

239
00:13:53,834 --> 00:13:55,501
AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Inaudible).

240
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:57,999
SAM BOWNE: You can't access all the sectors.

241
00:13:58,542 --> 00:14:00,667
AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Inaudible).

242
00:14:00,667 --> 00:14:03,999
SAM BOWNE: It's going to different sectors than you think it is.

243
00:14:03,999 --> 00:14:06,375
The only way to securely erase the SSD is to grind it up physically

244
00:14:06,375 --> 00:14:09,584
or replace the firmware with hacked firmware.

245
00:14:09,709 --> 00:14:12,167
Let me see what came here.

246
00:14:12,167 --> 00:14:15,083
AUDIENCE MEMBER: What about using a TrueCrypt image.

247
00:14:15,083 --> 00:14:17,417
SAM BOWNE: Now they are all gone.

248
00:14:17,417 --> 00:14:18,999
There's nothing on the desktop.

249
00:14:26,542 --> 00:14:27,292
AUDIENCE MEMBER: What about having that

250
00:14:27,292 --> 00:14:30,542
as a main pass protection, will that cause any issues later on?

251
00:14:30,542 --> 00:14:32,125
SAM BOWNE: You are on to it here.

252
00:14:32,125 --> 00:14:33,667
This is what Mac, iPhones do.

253
00:14:33,667 --> 00:14:33,999
iPhone 4S and later, you turn on encryption,

254
00:14:33,999 --> 00:14:36,999
before you save any data and then when you want to erase it,

255
00:14:36,999 --> 00:14:38,999
you erase the key.

256
00:14:39,542 --> 00:14:42,999
There's no way to erase all the data on there because some of it is going

257
00:14:42,999 --> 00:14:46,999
to sectors which are then mapped to be invisible to the drive.

258
00:14:46,999 --> 00:14:52,751
AUDIENCE MEMBER: The same thing with the MacBook Air.

259
00:14:54,167 --> 00:14:58,667
There's no way to clean it.

260
00:14:58,667 --> 00:15:00,584
Unless I turn on the encryption before you start and that's what

261
00:15:00,584 --> 00:15:01,999
iPhones do.

262
00:15:02,292 --> 00:15:05,417
AUDIENCE MEMBER: A fly in the ointment when you were trying

263
00:15:05,417 --> 00:15:08,959
to show there was still some data left, do you think that's

264
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:11,999
a result there was not enough activity going on and so

265
00:15:11,999 --> 00:15:15,792
the garbage collection was running efficiently?

266
00:15:15,792 --> 00:15:17,459
SAM BOWNE: It's a good question.

267
00:15:17,459 --> 00:15:19,375
Why did I not see the leftover letters.

268
00:15:19,375 --> 00:15:20,999
Sometimes I do and sometimes I don't and I'm always working the system

269
00:15:20,999 --> 00:15:23,083
on a completely empty partition.

270
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:26,083
The results are not always the same and I don't know what

271
00:15:26,083 --> 00:15:27,667
causes it.

272
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:30,999
That's the main thing I discovered is you really have to try it

273
00:15:30,999 --> 00:15:33,999
under your conditions to know what's going to happen.

274
00:15:33,999 --> 00:15:35,709
AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Inaudible).

275
00:15:35,709 --> 00:15:37,083
SAM BOWNE: Yes, Apple to tell you and there were a bunch

276
00:15:37,083 --> 00:15:40,250
of other SSD brands and you wouldn't know about them.

277
00:15:53,459 --> 00:15:54,626
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Have you done any research in terms

278
00:15:54,626 --> 00:15:55,709
of the whether or not the system is handing off, like,

279
00:15:55,709 --> 00:15:56,959
power commands so that it's not running a garbage collection

280
00:15:56,959 --> 00:16:00,083
during certain moments to save battery life on certain devices.

281
00:16:00,083 --> 00:16:01,209
Is that tied in at all?

282
00:16:01,209 --> 00:16:02,584
SAM BOWNE: I don't know.

283
00:16:02,584 --> 00:16:05,751
He's asking if you turn off garbage collection to save power.

284
00:16:05,751 --> 00:16:07,792
I do not know in the computer can do that.

285
00:16:07,792 --> 00:16:07,792
It sounds like a good idea to me, but    AUDIENCE

286
00:16:07,792 --> 00:16:08,959
MEMBER: (Inaudible).

287
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:10,250
SAM BOWNE: I haven't heard any I haven't read anything

288
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:13,709
about being able to do that.

289
00:16:13,709 --> 00:16:14,999
It sounds like a good idea.

290
00:16:14,999 --> 00:16:16,125
Yeah.

291
00:16:16,542 --> 00:16:17,999
Maybe we ought to gather in the hallway and get out of the way

292
00:16:17,999 --> 00:16:19,501
of the next person.
