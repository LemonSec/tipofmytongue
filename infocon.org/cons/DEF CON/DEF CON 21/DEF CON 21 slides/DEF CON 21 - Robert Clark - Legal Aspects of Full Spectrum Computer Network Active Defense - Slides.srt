1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,429
 Hey, everybody. Listen up. We're a little
early. We'll get started. This is "legal aspects

2
00:00:03,429 --> 00:00:10,429
of active defense." I am always pleased when
techies come and want to see how law intersects

3
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:15,570
with technology. And years ago I mentioned
that to, Marcus Sax, who is a SANS instructor

4
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:19,510
at Verizon and all that stuff. And I said
Marcus I am always amazed that like the orom

5
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:22,960
will fill up and people actually show up.
And he said yeah, or the other rooms are all

6
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:28,240
full and they don't have any other place to
go. So if you're here because you want to

7
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,759
see how they intersect, great. Wonderful.
This is great. But if you're here because

8
00:00:31,759 --> 00:00:35,810
all the other rooms have filled up and you
couldn't go anyplace else, sorry about that.

9
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:41,480
We'll try to get bigger rooms next time.
So legal aspect of computer network defense.

10
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:46,380
The agenda, the things we're going to talk
about here as we go through, to figure out

11
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:51,570
what are those things that you need to do
to be able to do computer network active defense.

12
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:56,470
Disclaimer aspect on things. I am here in
a personal capacity. I represent no employer,

13
00:00:56,470 --> 00:01:02,140
entity, Government organization. Anything.
So I hope to be informative to you and give

14
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:06,439
you some information and yet still may be
a little bit entertaining.

15
00:01:06,439 --> 00:01:11,670
I have spoken at numerous Black Hats and DEF
CONs before and typically I have the only

16
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:17,280
million dollar give away. And what that is
is for any question or the best question,

17
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:23,780
best comment or even best heckle, I usually
will give away a $5, a $10 or a $25 chip under

18
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:27,939
the million dollar give away. Now you have
to take the chip and go out to the casino

19
00:01:27,939 --> 00:01:31,249
and parlay that into a million dollars on
that.

20
00:01:31,249 --> 00:01:34,520
(Laughter)
Now I normally, that's what I do. I'm going

21
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:37,829
to apologize. That's been canceled due to
sequestration.

22
00:01:37,829 --> 00:01:41,409
(Laughter)
So if you're pissed at your Government for

23
00:01:41,409 --> 00:01:46,069
things, let me explain something. Talk to
my wife about having 20 percent pay taken

24
00:01:46,069 --> 00:01:50,789
away. That's when you get pissed, when you
have to deal with that on the home front.

25
00:01:50,789 --> 00:01:57,789
There is a current topic out there, that is
quite pressing. It is ripe for comedy, and

26
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:06,179
I've been having fun with it. It involves
the United States Government. And while the

27
00:02:06,179 --> 00:02:10,910
United States Government was founded on happiness,
I think if you look at the Declaration of

28
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:16,280
Independence in there you will see that basically,
you know, it is founded on happiness. We are

29
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:21,090
the only happy country. You look at any of
the other documents out there, the Magna carta

30
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:26,950
or anything, they don't mention happiness.
With that said, I have spoken to sources familiar

31
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:32,560
with the matter and they tell me that the
Government has no sense of humor on this topic.

32
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:37,200
And so, therefore, we will not be making any
folks about that whatsoever.

33
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:43,930
As we go along, I have an active defense scenario
to talk about. A spoiler alert here. If you

34
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:48,200
don't want to know how it comes out at the
end, please turn away from the screens and

35
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:55,200
look the other way. Because the way that it
ends, he's the bad guy on this.

36
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:59,650
And if you're from my generation, actually,
he's the bad guy.

37
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:03,290
(Applause)
And I know we're not supposed to do any sponsorships

38
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:07,760
or plugs, but because I'm a Chrysler kid from
Detroit, Mighigan, and I can also get fine

39
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:14,760
Corinthian leather from him on that.
This is the first year that I'm going to hand

40
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:19,959
out a Robert Clark cybersecurity award.
 Drink.

41
00:03:19,959 --> 00:03:26,959
 ROBERT CLARK: What? Oh, drink. There was
a different one last year at Black hat. They

42
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:32,430
said any time anybody says "cyber," you're
supposed to shout out something else. I can't

43
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:37,300
stand the word "Cyber." Absolutely hate it.
I'm a computer network guy from the aspects

44
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:41,430
of a decade. But if you want to have money
thrown at anything, you've got to have the

45
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:47,100
word "cyber" in it. If you wanted port-a-pottys
for DoD, you would say these are cyber port-a-pottys

46
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:52,380
and they would give you thousands of dollars
for these things. And of course you would

47
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:58,840
say wait a second, what makes it a cyber port-a-potty?
Well, there's a key pad --> don't even go there.

48
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:03,810
So I would like to give the first Robert Clark
cyber security award to someone who has done

49
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:08,480
something to advance cyber security. So who
should this possibly go to? You've got folks

50
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:13,600
like, you know, Leo La Port out there doing
stuff, Tom Merits doing good work. Like Steve

51
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:18,859
Gibson's aspect, and I even like Patrick Gray
and the risky business. All of these folks

52
00:04:18,859 --> 00:04:23,009
are out there. And while I would like to kiss
up to them and to get onto their shows, I

53
00:04:23,009 --> 00:04:25,189
really actually want to kiss up to Steven
Cobert.

54
00:04:25,189 --> 00:04:29,949
(Laughter)
Now, if you're wondering why? Well, you know,

55
00:04:29,949 --> 00:04:36,419
he knows the technology. Now granted a couple
years ago it was very archaic. Of course this

56
00:04:36,419 --> 00:04:40,759
might be the securest way to communicate these
days. I can't see below the table to see if

57
00:04:40,759 --> 00:04:45,610
there is anybody in the middle, but you never
know. But he knows the technology. I mean,

58
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:50,499
he gets customized technology that he gets
to use. One of the first users of a tablet.

59
00:04:50,499 --> 00:04:57,499
Into that virtualization aspects. Even invented
his own Google Glasses. So from that aspect

60
00:04:57,669 --> 00:05:01,199
what more could you want from somebody? He
knows the technology so much he even advised

61
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:06,740
Anthony Wieder, a/k/a Carlos Danger, they
should be using snapchat. So, you know, the

62
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:13,740
guy is there. He knows the web. He knows iTunes.
He's got Google down, Bing, Twitter. Big coin

63
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:19,139
even talks about him and even PalTalk. If
you someone can come and tell me what PalTalk

64
00:05:19,139 --> 00:05:25,819
is afterwards, I'd appreciate that. He knows
the people, you know, from Jobs, to Schmidt

65
00:05:25,819 --> 00:05:30,580
and Gates and even knows Anonymous. As a matter
of fact, he probably knows Anonymous a little

66
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:35,740
too well and too closely.
If that's not enough for this award, he's

67
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:40,840
got a virtual presence. He's on the international
space station and he's even in animations.

68
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:46,300
So in my book he deserves the first Robert
Clark cybersecurity award. And if this isn't

69
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:50,610
enough to get me on his show, I really don't
know what it's going to take. It's not going

70
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:54,949
to be my intellect, from that aspect of it.
So now getting on to things. Disclaimer, again,

71
00:05:54,949 --> 00:05:59,620
I am here in a personal capacity. All the
opinions are my own.

72
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:06,449
Cyber education is a big piece. I am actually
leaving the United States Army cyber command,

73
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:12,990
which is not the same agency as the United
States cyber command. I work for General Hernandes.

74
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:18,110
This is my last day, actually, working for
him. And tomorrow I start at the Naval Academy

75
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:21,379
out at Anapolis on their faculty to educate
--

76
00:06:21,379 --> 00:06:25,300
(Applause)
So I'm a professor of law, this is sweet,

77
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:32,300
to teach midshipmen on the nontechnical content
for cyber operations, the law and policy aspects

78
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:38,909
on life. And so they have two core classes
that every midshipman must take, and we're

79
00:06:38,909 --> 00:06:44,550
developing a cyber operations major. West
Point also has an Army cyber center, so I'll

80
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:50,650
mention that with my Army heritage, and then
the other service has something they're doing,

81
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:55,520
too. But I have no affiliation with them.
So if I say something wrong, please by all

82
00:06:55,520 --> 00:07:00,360
means say you heard it from an officer at
Army Cyber Command. And if I say something

83
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:05,379
right, please say that this brilliant professor
from the Naval Academy said. I'd appreciate

84
00:07:05,379 --> 00:07:06,379
that.
(Laughter)

85
00:07:06,379 --> 00:07:12,469
When I go to a conference, I'm really hoping
that I'm taking away only one or two golden

86
00:07:12,469 --> 00:07:16,629
nuggets of information, because if I'm not
then I'm really stupid and I really should

87
00:07:16,629 --> 00:07:20,379
be studying a lot more.
And so the one golden nugget I want to give

88
00:07:20,379 --> 00:07:25,120
right up front, if you're interested in this
area, the American Bar Association cyber security

89
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,849
task force is going to be coming out with
a report that's supposed to be coming out

90
00:07:28,849 --> 00:07:34,009
soon with a report on active defense. So I
would say tuck this away if this is an area

91
00:07:34,009 --> 00:07:37,999
you are really interested in, and go to their
site down the road and see if they have that

92
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:41,849
coming out. Because they're going to talk
about some beaconing and some other aspects

93
00:07:41,849 --> 00:07:45,279
of it, so it might be something to tuck away
in a back pocket as we're moving about, talking

94
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:51,819
about doing active defense.
So law and computer network operations. If

95
00:07:51,819 --> 00:07:56,919
you ask the same question to two attorneys,
you will get a lot of --> you'll get four answers

96
00:07:56,919 --> 00:08:03,559
and there are only two attorneys there. The
thing is, I'm not your lawyer, and please

97
00:08:03,559 --> 00:08:08,089
ask questions at any time. Stand up, shout.
We will be glad to address them. The interaction

98
00:08:08,089 --> 00:08:12,819
is really what makes this thing go.
But I'd like to talk, if anyone was in Mark

99
00:08:12,819 --> 00:08:18,960
Weathorford's talk on the growing irrelevancy
of the US Government information sharing,

100
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:24,330
he made a point about attorneys. He didn't
say which ones. And he said that they were

101
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:29,129
very risk adverse and didn't understand the
technology. We'll get into Clark's law about

102
00:08:29,129 --> 00:08:33,610
dealing with your lawyers and technology a
little bit here. The aspect about being risk

103
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:40,250
adverse and what a lawyer's role is, and this
is kind of for you, I provide advice. I give

104
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:44,320
counsel. If it's something illegal I'll say
this breaks the law. If it violates a policy,

105
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:51,320
but I provide advice. The responsibility to
act on that belongs to my client or the commander

106
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:57,240
or the Government. And it's their job to say
got it? Okay. But you don't let your general

107
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:01,860
counsel run your company from that aspect.
And that's kind of an interesting take that

108
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:08,060
I had a problem with, with Mark Weatherford's
comments. And it's not --> I understand the

109
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:11,310
scenario. Yes, senior leadership's not going
to do anything unless their general counsel

110
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:15,470
says yes, you can do that.
That's backwards. The senior leadership is

111
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:20,110
supposed to listen to their general counsel,
it's their attorney. But they make the decisions

112
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:25,019
and if they're not going to make the decisions,
then they're the ones who are risk adverse.

113
00:09:25,019 --> 00:09:27,089
So that's the aspect and that's kind of the
role.

114
00:09:27,089 --> 00:09:31,220
Because when the day is over, I'm going to
go home and have a steak dinner. You guys

115
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:36,370
might be led away with handcuffs on, but I'm
going to go home and have a steak dinner on

116
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:38,470
that one.
Before we get started, there are a couple

117
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:44,779
cases I always like to point out. The United
States versus Proctor was the courts recognizing

118
00:09:44,779 --> 00:09:51,029
that computer security professionals are a
special skilled group. Proctor had the right

119
00:09:51,029 --> 00:09:56,190
to remain silent but he didn't have the ability.
He gave a nice detailed confession, to which

120
00:09:56,190 --> 00:10:01,069
the Judge elevated his sentence and said you've
got special skills and the Court's going to

121
00:10:01,069 --> 00:10:06,660
recognize that, though that's probably not
a great thing on the computer security side.

122
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:11,100
There is an Ishing wifi case that came out.
Now it's a civil case and it's one of those

123
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:18,100
patent trolling cases, In re Innovacio, from
this aspect. They're suing coffeehouses and

124
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:22,380
people that are using WiFi. And it's that
wonderful legitimate suit where, you know,

125
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:27,480
basically you send the coffeehouse a notice
saying for $7,000 I'll go away or we're going

126
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:34,399
to sue you. And they did it to 7100 hotels,
coffee shops. And they had a motion to enter

127
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:41,399
how they were going about sniffing and grabbing
the communications going across the WiFi.

128
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:48,750
And how it worked was they were using --> grabbing
data packets going over the unencrypted WiFi,

129
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:54,509
using things that are readily accessible to
the general public, and that the sniffing

130
00:10:54,509 --> 00:10:58,560
protocol they were using again was available
to the general public. And the court was basically

131
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:03,100
saying it falls under the wire tap exception
and so there is no problem with them doing

132
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:07,509
this. You can have, with the proper foundation,
this evidence can come in.

133
00:11:07,509 --> 00:11:12,750
So what they were doing is they were using
a Riverbed Air PCAP packet capture adapter

134
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:19,720
for 700 bucks. Wire shark. So with the laptop
software and the packet capture adapter, they

135
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:24,790
could get any communications, as long as they
were in range. All of these things are provided

136
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:30,209
by commercial providers. And so it didn't
violate the wire tap statute.

137
00:11:30,209 --> 00:11:34,630
Now this is kind of interesting, meaning so
back in the day --> and the way with technology

138
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:39,490
being generally available to people, it came
back out of a case called Kila where DEA looked

139
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:44,410
into a house using thermal imaging. The court
said no, that is not technology that's readily

140
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:48,579
available to the public. They don't have their
own helicopters with their own thermal imaging

141
00:11:48,579 --> 00:11:53,300
radar, so we're not going ot let you do that.
God, you know, what you folks are doing now

142
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:57,750
and the technology that's available to the
general public, it is a very interesting area

143
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:01,550
where we're going into in terms of what you
can sit there and sniff and grab that courts

144
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:06,449
are holding not a violation of the Electronic
Communication Privacy Act. And of course he

145
00:12:06,449 --> 00:12:09,410
said the public's lack of awareness of this
was irrelevant.

146
00:12:09,410 --> 00:12:12,930
So it's an interesting civil case that's out
there. It's not a criminal case that's out

147
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:18,319
there, but it was kind of interesting.
The constitution, pretty damn good document

148
00:12:18,319 --> 00:12:24,040
to run a country of 350 million people or
so, written in 1787, and then what happened

149
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:28,269
next were computers. Well, DOJ set up the
computer crime unit in 1991. There's a little

150
00:12:28,269 --> 00:12:33,639
gap there on that. And a little bit before
that, they did the Computer Fraud Act.

151
00:12:33,639 --> 00:12:39,379
So how does this law stuff apply to we the
geeks from that aspect? Now on the constitution,

152
00:12:39,379 --> 00:12:43,940
there is the Article 2 powers are the President's
powers, so it's kind of an interesting aspect.

153
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:48,069
There is a little known footnote in here that
you've got to kind of look for that Madison

154
00:12:48,069 --> 00:12:52,649
put in there. You know, he envisioned people
like Jobs inventing communication devices

155
00:12:52,649 --> 00:12:58,040
that were incredible. So under the Article
2 powers, the President can conduct a peer

156
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:01,319
network operations. He goes I don't know what
a computer is, but I'm sure it's going to

157
00:13:01,319 --> 00:13:05,399
be important in a couple years and please
keep an eye on the IRS for us.

158
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:09,699
(laughter)
So legal aspects of computer network defense.

159
00:13:09,699 --> 00:13:13,819
We had a preconversation up front here. We
were talking about some certain things. An

160
00:13:13,819 --> 00:13:18,209
important lessen learned which is relevant
to the area we're in right now, and this is

161
00:13:18,209 --> 00:13:23,870
very true, bad legal advice put OJ in jail.
It was an interesting aspect where again he

162
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:28,319
wanted to get his property back and his lawyer
told him, hey, if you don't breech the peace,

163
00:13:28,319 --> 00:13:32,779
don't use force, you can go get your property.
Of course, the facts of the case is that he

164
00:13:32,779 --> 00:13:37,360
went there with a couple buddies that had
guns, breeching the peace, and he's in jail.

165
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,870
And so basically he kind of needs that number
right there.

166
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:45,250
If you are out there, I've seen some of the
attendees doing things, this is a valid number,

167
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:48,610
you may want to jot this down for the weekend
on that.

168
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:54,370
So, again, I am not your lawyer. When I try
to come up with a topic for DEF CON, I want

169
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:58,629
to make sure that it is relevant to what's
going on. And this IP Commission report just

170
00:13:58,629 --> 00:14:03,939
came out recently, and it was interesting
from an aspect of again the DOJ had a chance

171
00:14:03,939 --> 00:14:09,000
to put in there that they say hacking back
is illegal. So don't do it. The report was

172
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:14,639
written by Dennis Blair, who was the first
DNI director, and Huntsman who used to be

173
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:19,639
the ambassador to China. The report really
said that hey, if I can retrieve my digital

174
00:14:19,639 --> 00:14:25,199
property without damaging that person's computers,
I should be able to do that. So we're talking

175
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:29,439
about self defense.
There are 21 state constitutions that say

176
00:14:29,439 --> 00:14:34,199
that you have a constitutional right to defend
your property on that. It is recognized in

177
00:14:34,199 --> 00:14:38,290
common law and goes back a long time that
you have the right to defend yourself and

178
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:42,750
your property, from that aspect. And it kind
of flows into this thing called trespass to

179
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:48,740
chattel. Now the Intel versus Hamadi case
was that blasting of emails to Intel by Hamadi.

180
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:54,600
And one of the things that the court said
was we favor in this area trespass prevention

181
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:58,800
over post-trespass recovery. That's kind of
the theme of what we're going to be talking

182
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:03,050
about here. We're going to be talking about
those things you do ahead of time so you don't

183
00:15:03,050 --> 00:15:08,550
have to do post-trespass recovery. The active
defense scenario obviously is going to be

184
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:13,389
a post-trespass recovery scenario as we go
down there.

185
00:15:13,389 --> 00:15:16,939
Self defense, you have to be in a place you
have the right to be. A whole bunch of other

186
00:15:16,939 --> 00:15:19,910
factors that go with it. But you've really
got to be in that place that you have a right

187
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:25,720
to be. It is not unlimited for property. You
can't usually use deadly force to defend your

188
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:30,569
property, under certain circumstances. That
actually will come back into play. So you've

189
00:15:30,569 --> 00:15:34,699
got to be in a place you have the right to
be with all the factors that go in there.

190
00:15:34,699 --> 00:15:39,329
We were also talking earlier about if we were
going to do this, you know, who are the experts

191
00:15:39,329 --> 00:15:46,040
we listen to. Stewart Baker, formerly of Steptoe
and Johnson, actually he is with them now,

192
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:50,199
is quite the advocate that you should be able
to hack back. And I was at the FC conference

193
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:55,819
in Maryland and he offered to represent anyone
who did it and was prosecuted by the DOJ,

194
00:15:55,819 --> 00:16:00,720
for free. Now, you can call him p and say
hey, I heard from this guy --> and he might

195
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:05,970
hang up on you, but that's what I heard.
Orin Kerr who is a professor at George Washington

196
00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:10,879
University and who writes the book on computer
crime has pointblank said I don't think there

197
00:16:10,879 --> 00:16:15,439
is a digital self-help as the way things stand
right now. So sorry to ruin that for you for

198
00:16:15,439 --> 00:16:20,009
where we're going to go with our scenario,
but if it's me and I'm going to be prosecuted,

199
00:16:20,009 --> 00:16:25,439
I'm going to get Jennifer Granick or Orin
Kerr to represent me. And both of them have

200
00:16:25,439 --> 00:16:28,670
there is no digital self-help, you know, self-help
defense here.

201
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:34,610
Jennifer was on Patrick Gray's Risky Business
pod cast 272 talking about this extensively.

202
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:38,350
And, again, she said there is no digital self
defense.

203
00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:43,310
So what you've got to do as we're talking
about building that case of reasonableness,

204
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:46,920
what are those things you're going to do that
are necessary and reasonable. So when we're

205
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:50,279
building that case of reasonableness, you've
got to think what are the things you're doing

206
00:16:50,279 --> 00:16:55,819
to secure and defend. And it's that aspect
of technology, your open source and situational

207
00:16:55,819 --> 00:17:01,310
awareness, intelligence, your policies, your
training, information control, active defense

208
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:05,750
things you may need to do, which might be
deception, recovery operations. You know,

209
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:10,039
the stopping the pain aspects on life.
And what is the one thing that was missing

210
00:17:10,039 --> 00:17:16,640
from all those slides that is extremely important
to DOJ? Previous and ongoing coordination

211
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:21,939
with law enforcement agencies. And why is
this important? Because if you're planning

212
00:17:21,939 --> 00:17:27,230
on doing this, in reality, why are you preparing
for this? Because you're trying to convince

213
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:31,870
DOJ not to prosecute you or any other type
of law enforcement agency or prosecutorial

214
00:17:31,870 --> 00:17:36,860
office to prosecute you. What are the things
I did ahead of time that were reasonable that

215
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:42,240
I had to take the next step. Or worse case
scenario, you're going to have to try to convince

216
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:46,039
a Judge or jury that you have a self defense
claim.

217
00:17:46,039 --> 00:17:51,200
So the reality and the practicality of this
is simply DOJ is always and has always been

218
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:56,580
taking a hard look at this and a hard stance
on this. Until the law is amended, they feel

219
00:17:56,580 --> 00:18:01,529
that this is a crime.
Now, don't blame DOJ. You don't beat the monkey

220
00:18:01,529 --> 00:18:07,309
if the organ grinder is not present. Go see
Congress, because Congress is the ones that

221
00:18:07,309 --> 00:18:10,210
is responsible to amend the law for that aspect
of it.

222
00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:16,029
So the requirements for self defense, or a
necessity defense, require that there are

223
00:18:16,029 --> 00:18:23,029
no other lawful means available. Meaning you've
gone to CNLEA. All your remedies have been

224
00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:28,950
exhausted, meaning no law enforcement, the
civil lawsuits have been filed on that. And

225
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:34,320
I go back to this prosecuting computer crimes
manual that DOJ has had out for a long time.

226
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:38,809
Again, doing so may be illegal regardless
of your motive.

227
00:18:38,809 --> 00:18:44,700
The other aspect for you all that I've had
conversations with some techies on, it's the

228
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:50,440
aspect of resource intensive. So if you've
got this honeypot with a bunch of fake documents

229
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:55,059
in there and they say no, the big problem
with this is my clients can't manage their

230
00:18:55,059 --> 00:18:59,309
real stuff and now you want them to have a
bunch of fake stuff on there? I don't have

231
00:18:59,309 --> 00:19:04,700
time managing the real stuff. So this is very
resource intensive from my perspective. So

232
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:07,330
I don't think it's a mom and pop shop thing
that they're going to be doing.

233
00:19:07,330 --> 00:19:12,710
I did government contract litigation and we
had a lot of mom and pop third-party suppliers.

234
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:15,919
I can't see they're the ones doing this. It
has got to be somebody that's got a lot of

235
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:20,240
resources to dive into this.
So building that case of reasonableness, the

236
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:24,610
things I think you need to do so you can actually
get to that active defense scenario.

237
00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:27,820
There's the technology you've go to have in
place. And you guys, I'm talking to the experts

238
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:30,830
that know all of that. So you're talking about
your different, you know, your firewalls,

239
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:36,730
your intrusion systems, realtime network awareness,
SL proxy things, your logging, your monitoring

240
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:41,900
on that. And you've got some honeypots flowing
from that aspect. So you're doing all this.

241
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:45,890
And of course legally you can do this, because
to do this you've got to comply with the law,

242
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:49,830
which would be the wire tap statute. So you're
either getting consent of your users through

243
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:54,539
log-ins or banners from that aspect on life,
or you're doing it in the service providers

244
00:19:54,539 --> 00:19:59,390
aspect, with the exception to the wire tap
statute that says hey, it's my property. I

245
00:19:59,390 --> 00:20:03,860
can defend it. It's necessary to the defense
of the property. And these are the cases that

246
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:07,570
came out of the Blue Box cases, where they
had to find out --> you know, after taking

247
00:20:07,570 --> 00:20:12,330
the whistle out of the Captain Crunch box.
It's back in the way where they recorded the

248
00:20:12,330 --> 00:20:15,860
beginning part of the conversations, half
of it and all of it. And when the cases got

249
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:19,899
to the court, the Judge said okay, you recorded
the front part of it, that was tailored. You

250
00:20:19,899 --> 00:20:23,149
identified what the phone number was. Those
are going to go forward. And when they recorded

251
00:20:23,149 --> 00:20:29,890
more of the conversation, like half of it,
where the prosecutor could submit why they

252
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:33,429
needed to record half of it, those cases went
forward. And if they couldn't, they were thrown

253
00:20:33,429 --> 00:20:36,620
out. And pretty much when they recorded the
whole thing, the Judge said you didn't tailor

254
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:40,220
this at all, we're throwing this out.
So now how do you tailor computer network

255
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:44,330
defense? How do you tailor your intrusion
detection systems? It's not like I can record

256
00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:48,350
the first part of a three-way handshake. And
kind of, in my opinion, it means like I'm

257
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:52,179
going to run my snort sensors out there and
I'm going to grab everything. You know, see

258
00:20:52,179 --> 00:20:55,750
how much my storage space is going to have,
whether this is overwritten in 4 hours or

259
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:59,100
whether it stays on there for 30 days. And
when I get my alerts I can go back and grab

260
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:02,690
the information and take a look at it to review
my computer security. So from that aspect

261
00:21:02,690 --> 00:21:06,080
that seems reasonable. It's tailored. And
there hasn't been an argument or a debate

262
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:10,270
on that aspect of it from the technology speaking
aspect.

263
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:16,909
When I talk to techies, I always ask one thing.
Why aren't the crown jewels, air gapped off

264
00:21:16,909 --> 00:21:21,320
and why aren't they encrypted in data at rest?
Again, being the lawyer and the stupid one

265
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:25,120
in the room, I'm thinking okay, it has got
to be expensive, it's got to take time, it's

266
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:31,409
got to slow things down. And I've actually
had techies come back and go no, not so much.

267
00:21:31,409 --> 00:21:36,140
So if I'm wrong at that, please tell me on
that aspect of it. But I'm always curious

268
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:41,909
at why the crown jewels of a company aren't
separated off, air gapped, and aren't things

269
00:21:41,909 --> 00:21:46,950
in place to protect them? Again, steps that
are reasonable to defend the information that

270
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:50,899
you want to do.
I did mention beacons before. I will note

271
00:21:50,899 --> 00:21:57,899
that DOJ has a --> again, it's one of the absurdities
of law, the way it's written. If you're not

272
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:02,760
an electronic service provider, you can't
do beacons. It's a strange thing on that.

273
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:07,010
Again, that's something I'm hoping that the
ABA task force report will talk about as we

274
00:22:07,010 --> 00:22:12,549
go down the road.
Pen testing and red teaming. One of the things

275
00:22:12,549 --> 00:22:17,960
you need to be kind of concerned about actually
is the Landem Act. It's a national system

276
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:24,960
for trademark registration to protect your
trademarks from either consumer confusion

277
00:22:25,049 --> 00:22:30,450
or dilution. And that means if you're using
that mark and it reduces people's perception

278
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:36,179
of it, you can have a problem. Why would this
come into this field? So you have --> you go

279
00:22:36,179 --> 00:22:40,620
to your lawyer and you go hey, we want to
do spear fishing. Okay. And Beyonce's concert

280
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:45,799
is coming up, so we want to send that out
to our employees that for $45 if you click

281
00:22:45,799 --> 00:22:50,750
here, you can get $45 tickets front row to
Beyonce. Is that a problem? The lawyer doesn't

282
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:55,000
know much about technology. He's busy with
other things, so he says go ahead. So they

283
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:59,020
ahead and they sent that out. The next thing
you know they forward it to two friends and

284
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:01,870
they forward it to two friends and they forward
it to two friends and it goes outside your

285
00:23:01,870 --> 00:23:06,850
network and now everyone's sitting there going
wow, we can get Beyonce tickets for $45.

286
00:23:06,850 --> 00:23:10,630
And Beyonce's attorney comes knocking at your
door going who the hell are you and what the

287
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:15,460
hell you doing? So that's the aspect. If you
don't plan for these things and make them

288
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:19,870
so they can't get released into the wild,
you can have a problem here.

289
00:23:19,870 --> 00:23:26,490
Now, I am not a Landem Act attorney. And before
you blast me to the evaluation boards and

290
00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:30,330
everything, you need to understand one thing.
You're going to go hire the law firm of Dewey,

291
00:23:30,330 --> 00:23:33,399
Cheatem and Howe. And they're going to give
you their legal advice for what you need to

292
00:23:33,399 --> 00:23:38,090
do, and there are a whole bunch of people
in this law firm. And one of the branches

293
00:23:38,090 --> 00:23:41,860
you're going to have to go see is the Landem
Act branch to talk to them about this and

294
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:46,370
how to go about doing that. So that's one
situation in your law firm that you're going

295
00:23:46,370 --> 00:23:50,010
to have to deal with.
Intelligence and situational awareness. You've

296
00:23:50,010 --> 00:23:53,190
got to know what's going on out there. So
you've got your open source intelligence,

297
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:56,440
where you're going to have your bulletins
from the OSERT. You're going to hire a commercial

298
00:23:56,440 --> 00:24:00,260
company to give you added intelligence on
that. Because we know the Government doesn't

299
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:04,500
get anything first. And so you're going to
get that private information there. You're

300
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:08,029
going to do active business intelligence,
which you're going to do that competitive

301
00:24:08,029 --> 00:24:13,240
intelligence. And you've got to be careful
not to step on the side of economic espionage.

302
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:19,159
Economic espionage. So that's set up to protect
trade secrets and information. Again, in the

303
00:24:19,159 --> 00:24:24,590
time of this high technology information age.
So a couple things. It's getting that information

304
00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:28,110
without authority. You know, you kind of kwow
when you got it without authority, and then

305
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:31,720
the trade secrets.
Now. Good old dog and Christian here kind

306
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:37,169
of wrote an article dealing with looking at
these aspects of economic espionage. And they

307
00:24:37,169 --> 00:24:41,559
say hey, it's a very broad topic. And you've
got to kind of be aware of it. You can get

308
00:24:41,559 --> 00:24:46,580
into trouble when you're doing this aspects
of getting open source intelligence. Some

309
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:52,149
lawful means of going out and grabbing information
can in fact become misappropriation. And so

310
00:24:52,149 --> 00:24:55,820
you've got to be careful because that combination
of all that public information could get you

311
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:59,429
into trouble. Again, this is kind of dogging
Christian's take on this.

312
00:24:59,429 --> 00:25:05,450
Now, there is a case out there that kind of
said look, possession of open source information

313
00:25:05,450 --> 00:25:10,110
or readily ascertainable information is clearly
not espionage. So you've got some case law

314
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:13,870
on your side there.
But Bill Bradford kind of went down this path

315
00:25:13,870 --> 00:25:16,559
and was talking about the different aspects
of economic espionage when he was looking

316
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:21,200
at firms routinely getting this stuff.
And that practice of getting open source publicly

317
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:24,730
available information for that. So what are
you talking about? The desired information

318
00:25:24,730 --> 00:25:29,409
you're looking at. You know, research plans,
R&D, things of nature, strategies out there,

319
00:25:29,409 --> 00:25:33,860
publicly available information.
You're looking at, you know, common ways to

320
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:39,000
do this. Data mining, patent. I like the psychological
modeling of rival executives. I think that's

321
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:44,559
kind of neat. That's like my wife wants me
to have that done, too. So there's that.

322
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:50,820
Areas that kind of raised some questions that
he looked at when you're talking about ethical

323
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:54,549
questions was interesting. Because he was
like appropriating documents that are misplaced

324
00:25:54,549 --> 00:26:00,820
by rivals, which gets into okay, if I've got
an iPhone left behind, if you go to your lawyer

325
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:04,870
and say hey, I found this. Oh, abandoned property.
Hey, it's abandoned. There are no rights to

326
00:26:04,870 --> 00:26:08,929
that property anymore. Let's rip it apart.
Okay. Well, there might be that theory.

327
00:26:08,929 --> 00:26:13,640
He talks about overhearing rivals, executives.
You know, I'm a fan of if you come talk to

328
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:17,279
me about this one, I'm like hey, that is misplaced
trust. I mean, that's the third party doctrine

329
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:20,929
where if you're going to say something, broadcasting
it out. You know, again, these are areas where

330
00:26:20,929 --> 00:26:24,220
it could raise ethical questions, not quite
blank illegal.

331
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:28,760
Hiring employees away from rivals, you've
got a Computer Fraud And Abuse Act thing that

332
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:31,250
really comes into play on that one you've
got to be careful on.

333
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:34,860
And I love the dumpster diving aspect on life.
Because actually there are some court cases

334
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:39,100
out there that once you put your trash out
by the curb, anybody can go diving into it

335
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:42,440
as much as they want.
Those areas that are clearly illegal, yeah,

336
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:48,880
the kind of stuff that you all are really
good at on that, and so you've got to be careful

337
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:53,500
on those things.
Again, I'm not an economic espionage lawyer,

338
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:56,230
so you're going to go to your law firm of
Dewey, Cheatem and Howe. You're going to go

339
00:26:56,230 --> 00:27:00,740
up to the economic espionage branch and say:
Here is what I'm planning on doing on this.

340
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:05,029
You know, what do you think? And you've got
to take them through step by step those things

341
00:27:05,029 --> 00:27:09,110
that you're going to do.
Ironically enough there was a case that came

342
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:15,909
out just a while ago, the Lenikov case. A
lot of times when you read facts or opinions

343
00:27:15,909 --> 00:27:20,539
on a case, they kind of tell you where they're
going as you go through them. So Serge was

344
00:27:20,539 --> 00:27:25,549
a computer programmer for Goldman Sachs. He
was responsible for one of their high end

345
00:27:25,549 --> 00:27:32,549
important aspects. And it did market developments.
It was proprietary information and he was

346
00:27:33,850 --> 00:27:39,710
one of 25 programmers in the highest paid
at $400,000. And this was where the facts

347
00:27:39,710 --> 00:27:43,720
get fun, and he's going to be hired at a competitor
for a million bucks.

348
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:47,289
So we can kind of see where things are going,
especially when the court says on his last

349
00:27:47,289 --> 00:27:53,630
day of employment, and then it gets better,
just before his going away party going, he

350
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:58,850
decided to give himself a little gift, which
was 500,000 lines of code. He sent that off

351
00:27:58,850 --> 00:28:05,580
to Germany and then downloaded it later from
Germany. And of course he deleted everything

352
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:09,940
that he did. And of course he's surprised
when he has a "who farted" look when they

353
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:14,110
come around and arrest him. You're kidding?
And he ends up getting convicted of economic

354
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:21,110
espionage for stealing the source code.
Well, he appeals this on the --> at the appellate

355
00:28:21,429 --> 00:28:26,049
level. The appellate court held that this
was not a violation of the Economic Espionage

356
00:28:26,049 --> 00:28:30,539
Act. So before you think about going and doing
that, it's been modified and amended to take

357
00:28:30,539 --> 00:28:36,600
that into consideration, so don't go do that.
The next area of reasonableness and things

358
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:42,159
you need to do prior to going and hacking
someone's computer, your information insurance

359
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:46,080
policies and training. The big aspect on this
is having them in place. You have got your

360
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:50,750
banners and user agreements. Being consistent
with then and enforcing them when something

361
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:54,909
goes wrong. So especially with the insider
threat aspect, if you're going to do a civil

362
00:28:54,909 --> 00:28:59,960
suit for computer fraud and abuse, were employees
being disciplined for violating these different

363
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:03,269
procedures? So you want to make sure that
you're enforcing these policies and you're

364
00:29:03,269 --> 00:29:07,620
actually on top of them.
Information control. It's the stuff you all

365
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:11,850
know about. It's the access lists, encryption,
digital rights management. Again, another

366
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:15,510
step for reasonableness. So if I have got
to be in front of a Judge, I can say here

367
00:29:15,510 --> 00:29:20,559
are all the things I did before I had to actually
go and retrieve my property.

368
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:25,559
The deception piece is a very interesting
aspect. When you get a bunch of lawyers sitting

369
00:29:25,559 --> 00:29:29,120
around just talking this stuff around, somebody
invariably will bring something up like, hey,

370
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:32,260
did anybody ever think about the SEC? And
you're like what the hell does the SEC have

371
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:38,909
to do with a deception plan aspect? The companies
have responsibilities to actually do reporting.

372
00:29:38,909 --> 00:29:43,990
And thanks to good old Reid Hastings and Netflix,
you know, the SEC said we can come out and

373
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:50,519
we can investigate anything that we want that
we think is a possible violation of the SEC

374
00:29:50,519 --> 00:29:55,360
laws. Now I'm not an SEC attorney and I don't
want to be an SEC attorney. So you're going

375
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:58,809
to go over to Dewey, Cheatem and Howe and
go over to the SEC branch to start getting

376
00:29:58,809 --> 00:30:02,039
their advice.
Now, the disclosure piece on this becomes

377
00:30:02,039 --> 00:30:07,190
a very interesting aspect when you're in this
area. So you want to do a deception plan,

378
00:30:07,190 --> 00:30:11,799
so you're going to have things out there internal
to your network that is not going to be out

379
00:30:11,799 --> 00:30:17,940
there, that are wrong, that are erroneous,
that are deception. So it's no intent. You're

380
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:24,429
not going to make this public. Then they're
stolen and they're leaked to the media.

381
00:30:24,429 --> 00:30:29,720
Is this a disclosure that you've made? I know,
they're stolen. They are leaked to the media,

382
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:34,710
you know, is this an SEC violation or not?
I really don't know. Tell me how it works

383
00:30:34,710 --> 00:30:39,950
out when you're in front of SEC attorneys.
Because When you're talking about deception

384
00:30:39,950 --> 00:30:42,620
plans or deception examples, what are you
going to be putting out there?

385
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:46,580
Requests for proposals. Now, those could be
your requests for proposals that you're putting

386
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:51,130
out to your suppliers. Or they could be requests
for proposals that you have received as you're

387
00:30:51,130 --> 00:30:55,630
doing your bid preparations. So you're putting
false information out there, on there, to

388
00:30:55,630 --> 00:31:00,809
be grabbed by your competitors so they don't
know what you're doing.

389
00:31:00,809 --> 00:31:06,000
Blueprints and designs. All right. Minor defects.
We went back and we said self defense of property,

390
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:10,940
you can't harm somebody when you're going
to defend your property. So it's a minor defect

391
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:16,700
or a major defect. Are you going to cause
harm? If it's a product that has engineering

392
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:21,120
aspects of it, if it's computer code and somebody
looks at it and downloads it and melts their

393
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:26,559
server, are you liable? If it's a car and
the brakes don't work, are you liable? So

394
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:30,610
these are all things that you need to talk
to your folks about when you're planning on

395
00:31:30,610 --> 00:31:33,190
doing this.
Business plans and financial records. Again,

396
00:31:33,190 --> 00:31:37,289
you're sitting around. I'm not a mergers and
acquisitions guy, but somebody comes up and

397
00:31:37,289 --> 00:31:41,450
goes whoa! Wait! Mergers and acquisitions.
You've got information about other people's

398
00:31:41,450 --> 00:31:46,970
real companies in here, and if that's stolen
and leaked to the media that could harm them.

399
00:31:46,970 --> 00:31:51,909
What if they come knocking on your door saying
this was your document. It's not true. I've

400
00:31:51,909 --> 00:31:57,179
suffered a harm. I want some money from you.
Now, your lawyers are going to say --> again,

401
00:31:57,179 --> 00:32:01,809
being risk adverse --> I don't want to invite
litigation in from this aspect. So you're

402
00:32:01,809 --> 00:32:05,610
going to have to be very specific as you go
through this, talking to your attorneys. You

403
00:32:05,610 --> 00:32:08,269
know, how you're going to protect this from
happening.

404
00:32:08,269 --> 00:32:15,269
Joke. Because I need a thinking break. Okay.
So NSA is going to store a whole bunch --> yes,

405
00:32:15,630 --> 00:32:21,070
it's controversial. So all of the aspects
of terabytes, petabytes, zettabytes, yottabytes.

406
00:32:21,070 --> 00:32:26,659
So I don't know --> so I was wondering, what's
a zettabyte? Well, I dated a Zeta at Michigan,

407
00:32:26,659 --> 00:32:33,659
so talk to me afterwards about that.
A petabyte. Do you realize if you Google the

408
00:32:33,669 --> 00:32:37,799
site of peta, like this is the cleanist image
you can actually put on a conference like

409
00:32:37,799 --> 00:32:42,740
this. So I guess that's a petabyte. And obviously
the yottabyte is easy. You have that yottabyte,

410
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:48,340
you have that yottabyte. And if that's not
enough, then you'll have a stream all over.

411
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:51,889
So I don't have a sponsor.
So, active defense.

412
00:32:51,889 --> 00:32:57,580
Actually, I did have a sponsor, but I don't
want to get into trouble. Ask me afterwards.

413
00:32:57,580 --> 00:33:04,580
Active defense. Recovery operations. The Kobayaski
Maru. I do like the new Star Trek. I like

414
00:33:05,179 --> 00:33:11,120
the old one, but I like the new one, too.
There is a certain aspect of a no win situation

415
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:16,049
when you're dealing with this. So I had colleagues
ask are you going to actually talk about Clark's

416
00:33:16,049 --> 00:33:19,350
law that nobody has ever heard of? And I'm
like yeah, I am.

417
00:33:19,350 --> 00:33:24,630
Clark's law. Get your attorneys involved early
and often. Explain the technology to them

418
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:28,289
at a third grade level so they can understand
it. Because they're going to have to turn

419
00:33:28,289 --> 00:33:32,850
to a Judge, jury, or seniors leaders and explain
it at a first grade level.

420
00:33:32,850 --> 00:33:39,850
So it is very important --> no. You're all
smart, so you're going to hire good lawyers

421
00:33:40,090 --> 00:33:45,200
that have been very well trained to be analytical,
to be able to ask the right questions on this

422
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:49,419
aspect. And that's what lawyers should be
trained to do. Be analytical and ask the right

423
00:33:49,419 --> 00:33:52,580
questions.
So when you're explaining the technology to

424
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:56,789
them, you're walking them through that at
that third grade level and they should be

425
00:33:56,789 --> 00:33:59,830
able to ask the questions and really understand
it.

426
00:33:59,830 --> 00:34:04,409
There's another aspect of Clark's law. Because
my active defense scenario, I am not a PowerPoint

427
00:34:04,409 --> 00:34:10,730
ranger so I have some very simplistic graphics
to go through our active defense scenario.

428
00:34:10,730 --> 00:34:16,000
So we have our intruder. He's going through
the innocent third-party, over to the victim.

429
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:21,000
He's going to ex-fill some information over
to an open FTP server. He has his other boxes,

430
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:25,389
his other hop-in point, and he's going to
download the information from there. So that's

431
00:34:25,389 --> 00:34:30,510
kind of our scenario for our active defense
scenario aspect on life.

432
00:34:30,510 --> 00:34:34,280
So what can I do? You know, the aspect on
logging. Yeah, we can can log until the cows

433
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:38,569
come home. You can log that third-party coming
in. You're going to kind of look, see has

434
00:34:38,569 --> 00:34:42,819
this third-party touched me before? What have
I got from my records? So logging is a piece

435
00:34:42,819 --> 00:34:47,679
of cake from that aspect.
The FTP server. Do you log the exfiltration

436
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:51,020
of data going out? I'm getting ahead of myself
because I'm going to knock off the exigent

437
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:56,810
circumstances right now. I always get the
argument, but they went to my R&D shop and

438
00:34:56,810 --> 00:35:00,880
got all of the documents and took out a terabyte
of stuff, I have got to go after it and get

439
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:06,470
it. All right. Fine. Then your lawyer needs
to ask a question, you saw them do that. When

440
00:35:06,470 --> 00:35:11,020
they exfilled the documents, what were the
documents? Most of the time we're finding

441
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:16,240
out that they encrypted them so you have no
clue what was taken. Now you do have --> part

442
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:20,930
of an argument to say yeah, but I know it
came from my R&D section, as opposed to just

443
00:35:20,930 --> 00:35:25,460
HR, which is probably nothing but Social Security
numbers and personal information. Who cares

444
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:32,109
about that? This is the company over here.
So the circumstances of having to go after

445
00:35:32,109 --> 00:35:36,710
it, it's kind of a challenge on that. But
you see on your logs that they went to your

446
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:39,730
FTP server out there, and you can get that
from your logs.

447
00:35:39,730 --> 00:35:46,730
Now, can you see the intruder on the FTP server?
It's an open FTP server. Now this is the part

448
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:51,430
when Marsha Hoffman from EFF was talking at
Black Hat, and she said the Computer Fraud

449
00:35:51,430 --> 00:35:56,700
And Abuse Act is kind of vague when it starts
getting into the aspect of without authority

450
00:35:56,700 --> 00:36:03,060
or in excess of your authority. Yes, the Computer
Fraud and Abuse Act is vague. But I hate to

451
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:08,569
go to the definition that I use for my children,
you know what the right choice is. Are you

452
00:36:08,569 --> 00:36:13,680
in a place that you have a right to be? And
it kind of comes down to that. If you're in

453
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:17,859
that gray area, you going to want to make
sure you're in a place you have a right to

454
00:36:17,859 --> 00:36:20,550
be.
So that FTP server, when you get in there,

455
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:23,800
if it's open and you can log on there, go
ahead. Hop on there. See where your files

456
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:28,890
are from that aspect. I'm not aware of logs
of somebody else logging into the FTP server

457
00:36:28,890 --> 00:36:32,960
is usually something you can see. So usually
you're going to have to elevate your privileges

458
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:38,569
to see those logs from the FTP server to get
to the intruder. Now, if that's the case then

459
00:36:38,569 --> 00:36:42,109
you've probably exceeded your authorities
and that access that you had, and that's probably

460
00:36:42,109 --> 00:36:46,010
count one of the Computer Fraud and Abuse
Act, be that as it may.

461
00:36:46,010 --> 00:36:49,280
We're going to cruise along here because I
want to talk about deleting data. So can you

462
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:54,440
delete the data on an FTP server? If I'm in
an open FTP, you can log in, I can log in,

463
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:59,490
you can log in, anybody can get on. I think
that, if we're all in agreement, I'm in a

464
00:36:59,490 --> 00:37:02,410
place I have a right to be. Would that be
correct? Okay.

465
00:37:02,410 --> 00:37:07,640
There are files on there. They are available.
I can open them up and look at them. You can

466
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:11,450
open them up and look at them. I can download
them, I can upload them. Again, is that kind

467
00:37:11,450 --> 00:37:15,869
of the way it's set up?
Can I delete files that are uploaded by somebody

468
00:37:15,869 --> 00:37:22,540
else on there? Yes or no. Is the answer --> if
the answer is both, then say both. To my world,

469
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:27,710
it's typically no. Now this is probably one
of the stupidest, silliest things. My files

470
00:37:27,710 --> 00:37:33,410
have been stolen. Uploaded there by somebody
else. It's my property that was taken. I'm

471
00:37:33,410 --> 00:37:39,720
in a place I have a right to be. Can I delete
those files? Logic says hell yeah, they're

472
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:45,930
my files. Yes. But if I don't have that authority
to delete files on that server, arguably,

473
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:51,750
I don't have that authority. What am I going
to do? Go talk to your attorney and don't

474
00:37:51,750 --> 00:37:54,690
tell me.
From that aspect, you know, it's an argument

475
00:37:54,690 --> 00:37:58,589
of whether I can delete that information or
not. Can I go to the intruder and delete that

476
00:37:58,589 --> 00:38:02,920
information that I've seen him take off of
there, a closed, protected computer? I have

477
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:08,950
no authority to be on that box. So from that
aspect, like I said, if you're going to do

478
00:38:08,950 --> 00:38:11,900
this, go talk to your attorneys from that
part and see how it works.

479
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:15,910
What if that's an innocent third party over
there? And what if you go to your and say

480
00:38:15,910 --> 00:38:20,540
we went to the FTP server, our documents went
out, and they're being stored by that party

481
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:25,480
box, can I get the logs from that? On an innocent
third-party box. Can I go touch that box?

482
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:27,970
And this innocent third-party, they don't
even know it's there. How do they know it's

483
00:38:27,970 --> 00:38:34,970
not there? Because they've got terabytes of
data there. There's a bunch of movies on there,

484
00:38:34,990 --> 00:38:37,900
a bunch of stuff on there. There's no way
they know what's on their system. Let's just

485
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:42,430
go in there, take our stuff off and away we
go. Well, again, the best way to do it is

486
00:38:42,430 --> 00:38:46,230
contact the third party and get consent. Any
time you get consent --> hear, talk to any

487
00:38:46,230 --> 00:38:50,240
law enforcement officer. Consent? Yeah, great,
let's go. Any time you get consent, that's

488
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:52,609
the way to go for it when you're talking about
that.

489
00:38:52,609 --> 00:38:56,050
Can you go back and trace them back? No. Say
you've got an innocent third-party, and they

490
00:38:56,050 --> 00:38:59,579
let you into their logs, and you get back
over to that intruder there, again we're still

491
00:38:59,579 --> 00:39:03,890
in that same situation where we're stuck.
You know, have you gone to law enforcement?

492
00:39:03,890 --> 00:39:07,220
Is law enforcement involved? Can they get
there fast enough from that aspect? If it

493
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:11,990
is a protected box, typically I cannot go
there and get that information.

494
00:39:11,990 --> 00:39:17,930
Deleting the data --> I want to move to if
it's a closed FTP server. If this is a closed

495
00:39:17,930 --> 00:39:24,930
FTP server and you see what the log-in information
is from your logs, can you go hop on it? Yes

496
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:32,020
or no. I hear some nos. So when we listen
to NSA and EFF up here, they talk about Smith

497
00:39:33,069 --> 00:39:38,000
versus Maryland. That's that case where when
I give my phone record to the phone company,

498
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:42,119
I've exposed it to a third party, I've got
no expectation of privacy in that. If I give

499
00:39:42,119 --> 00:39:49,119
you my log-in information, what's the difference?
Here's the aspect. So you've got the log-on

500
00:39:49,310 --> 00:39:54,940
information. It was exposed to you. I now
know it. Why can't I use it? All right. So

501
00:39:54,940 --> 00:40:01,339
you borrow --> you loan to your neighbor your
baseball mit, some property. And you want

502
00:40:01,339 --> 00:40:04,900
to get it back. And you go to their house
and they have got a cipher lock on their door.

503
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:09,550
Now they gave you that code because your kid
had to take care of their cat. So you had

504
00:40:09,550 --> 00:40:12,440
the authority to go over to take care of the
cat and use it. Do you have the authority

505
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:15,520
to go over to your neighbor's house to get
your baseball mitt back by using that cipher

506
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:21,690
code at that particular time? No. Typically
you don't. You're in your post trespass recovery

507
00:40:21,690 --> 00:40:25,710
phase from this aspect of it. It's the OJ
Simpson, don't breach the peace. Don't do

508
00:40:25,710 --> 00:40:29,200
anything. I mean, that's the aspects of it.
So when you go talk to your lawyers about

509
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:32,960
this aspect, you're going to say here's the
information I've got. Anybody can log into

510
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:37,849
it using this information. Why can't I log
into it and using this information and go

511
00:40:37,849 --> 00:40:41,510
do it?
Again, these are all these gray areas, this

512
00:40:41,510 --> 00:40:46,050
is the great part on providing the advice,
because then you get to make the decision

513
00:40:46,050 --> 00:40:50,950
and if it's wrong you're led away in hand
cuffs, and I'm having a steak dinner. And

514
00:40:50,950 --> 00:40:55,220
I won't have you as a client anymore. But,
at least I had my steak dinner.

515
00:40:55,220 --> 00:41:01,160
So clearly when we're talking about these
areas, they're very fact specific. And so

516
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:05,609
it's kind of difficult to try to get to the
questions on it. If a fact changes, it changes

517
00:41:05,609 --> 00:41:09,400
what you can and cannot do. So you need to
get involved with your attorneys as you're

518
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:14,059
walking through this. And, you know, obviously
doing this requires good computer network

519
00:41:14,059 --> 00:41:18,809
exploitation in terms of your attribution
and your log-ins that you've got for this.

520
00:41:18,809 --> 00:41:22,260
You know, there is an aspect that I always
get to as far as stopping the pain when you're

521
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:28,250
dealing with a denial of service tack. The
part that I would say you really want to look

522
00:41:28,250 --> 00:41:33,700
at for this is DOJ has done the Coroflood
botnet takedown, and those documents are all

523
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:39,010
publicly available. And the steps that they
go through to be able to do this kind of gives

524
00:41:39,010 --> 00:41:43,720
you a blueprint for how to legally do it.
And of course they are doing it with the courts

525
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:49,040
involved from that aspect. So if you're curious
about doing that part of it, the DOJ documents

526
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:53,589
that are publicly available out there are
a good starting point to take a look at that.

527
00:41:53,589 --> 00:41:58,770
As I mentioned before, the IP Commission report
talks about a lot of different areas that

528
00:41:58,770 --> 00:42:01,730
you may want to do this. And the American
Bar Association is going to be coming out

529
00:42:01,730 --> 00:42:06,740
with their report down the road.
Here is the big thing, and Jeff Moss talks

530
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:10,430
about this down the road. If you're going
to do stuff like this, you need to get a good

531
00:42:10,430 --> 00:42:15,119
team of lawyers. Jeff is actually a fan. I've
been at talks where he is like we need more

532
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:21,400
lawyers who do this to advance this. Not that
anybody really likes lawyers. Be that as it

533
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:25,069
may, you're really going to need a good team
of lawyers to do this. Or if you're really

534
00:42:25,069 --> 00:42:30,599
going to do this, you just need one really
good lawyer on that.

535
00:42:30,599 --> 00:42:35,470
So with that said, I will be going to a Q
and A session, I've got three minutes for

536
00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:40,290
questions right now, from what I understand.
So if there's any questions, I'll be hanging

537
00:42:40,290 --> 00:42:43,420
out up here.
Thank you for coming. I hope you got a golden

538
00:42:43,420 --> 00:42:46,020
nugget out of this. If not, I hope there was
a joke that you laughed at.

539
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:46,519
Thank you.
(Applause)
