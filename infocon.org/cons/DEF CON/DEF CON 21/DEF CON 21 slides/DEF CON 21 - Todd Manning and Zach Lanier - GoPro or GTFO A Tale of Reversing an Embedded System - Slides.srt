1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,876
So you are in the the

2
00:00:04,876 --> 00:00:11,501
act or GoPro or get the fuck

3
00:00:11,501 --> 00:00:14,000
in the marketing promotions for this.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,209
This is a fairly short talk.

5
00:00:17,209 --> 00:00:22,751
But Todd and I have basically been

6
00:00:22,751 --> 00:00:24,459
around with these cool awesome

7
00:00:24,459 --> 00:00:27,459
TODD MANNING: For 20 minutes.

8
00:00:27,459 --> 00:00:30,751
ZACH LANIER: For 20 minutes

9
00:00:30,751 --> 00:00:33,250
TODD MANNING: Our entire

10
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:34,626
including this talk.

11
00:00:34,626 --> 00:00:37,000
ZACH LANIER: Right.

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,999
So our agenda, the you know,

13
00:00:41,999 --> 00:00:46,000
will cover    Excuse me.

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,250
TODD MANNING: Entourage,

15
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:52,751
Only a 20 minute talk and

16
00:00:52,751 --> 00:00:54,334
That's too bad!

17
00:00:56,459 --> 00:01:03,250
TODD MANNING: This

18
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:10,083
You should have showed

19
00:01:10,083 --> 00:01:13,083
ZACH LANIER: Shit.

20
00:01:13,083 --> 00:01:15,375
Why are we here?

21
00:01:15,375 --> 00:01:17,999
TODD MANNING: Here here    First

22
00:01:17,999 --> 00:01:21,375
We we we figure that

23
00:01:21,375 --> 00:01:22,626
They have shot the n00b.

24
00:01:26,626 --> 00:01:28,584
TODD MANNING: N00b has

25
00:01:28,584 --> 00:01:32,417
of meanings and so there's only one

26
00:01:32,751 --> 00:01:37,999
So we also need somebody

27
00:01:37,999 --> 00:01:38,999
You, sir.

28
00:01:38,999 --> 00:01:40,999
TODD MANNING: Preferably

29
00:01:43,999 --> 00:01:46,334
He's Midway through the change.

30
00:01:46,334 --> 00:01:47,501
Come on up.

31
00:01:47,709 --> 00:01:52,999
TODD MANNING: I will take two.

32
00:01:53,125 --> 00:01:54,167
You know, guys try to act

33
00:01:54,167 --> 00:01:56,918
to make you drink

34
00:01:56,999 --> 00:01:57,999
I don't know.

35
00:01:58,334 --> 00:02:01,999
I guess ticket prices will be

36
00:02:01,999 --> 00:02:04,999
Now you have four minutes left.

37
00:02:04,999 --> 00:02:06,083
ZACH LANIER: Damn it!

38
00:02:06,083 --> 00:02:07,542
TODD MANNING: That's

39
00:02:07,542 --> 00:02:08,999
the material.

40
00:02:08,999 --> 00:02:09,999
(Laughter).

41
00:02:09,999 --> 00:02:12,209
ZACH LANIER: Shut up and drink.

42
00:02:12,209 --> 00:02:14,083
TODD MANNING: GoPro GTFO!

43
00:02:14,083 --> 00:02:15,083
Woo!

44
00:02:15,083 --> 00:02:21,959
TODD MANNING: Thank you,

45
00:02:23,501 --> 00:02:25,667
Do I get a GoPro.

46
00:02:25,667 --> 00:02:29,999
TODD MANNING: You know

47
00:02:31,792 --> 00:02:35,083
The young lady might have gotten

48
00:02:35,083 --> 00:02:37,834
ZACH LANIER: Traffic.

49
00:02:37,876 --> 00:02:41,375
TODD MANNING: Bring more booze

50
00:02:41,375 --> 00:02:44,292
ZACH LANIER: Okay.

51
00:02:44,292 --> 00:02:45,999
So continuing on.

52
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:48,751
So we'll have you're brief intro,

53
00:02:48,751 --> 00:02:50,501
while drinking.

54
00:02:50,999 --> 00:02:53,083
We'll talk a little bit

55
00:02:53,083 --> 00:02:56,751
to time limitations we will gloss

56
00:02:56,751 --> 00:02:59,209
We will cite previous research

57
00:02:59,209 --> 00:03:01,375
to mess with this but, you know,

58
00:03:01,375 --> 00:03:04,209
to give credit where credit is due.

59
00:03:04,792 --> 00:03:06,999
We will talk

60
00:03:06,999 --> 00:03:10,167
and we are certainly not finished.

61
00:03:10,667 --> 00:03:12,999
As well as some

62
00:03:12,999 --> 00:03:15,834
out of this research up to this point.

63
00:03:15,918 --> 00:03:19,083
We'll talk a little bit

64
00:03:19,083 --> 00:03:22,584
will conclude with a bunch

65
00:03:22,751 --> 00:03:24,209
So first, Todd.

66
00:03:24,209 --> 00:03:29,417
TODD MANNING: What's up?

67
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:31,083
I'm Todd Manning.

68
00:03:31,083 --> 00:03:34,083
Senior research consultant

69
00:03:34,626 --> 00:03:36,834
Horror for hire, you know.

70
00:03:36,999 --> 00:03:39,083
I used to work

71
00:03:39,083 --> 00:03:43,792
security research team and now I turn it

72
00:03:43,792 --> 00:03:48,083
ZACH LANIER: Hi, I'm Zach Lanier

73
00:03:48,334 --> 00:03:50,999
I'm also a senior research consultant.

74
00:03:50,999 --> 00:03:52,125
Did I get a whistle?

75
00:03:52,292 --> 00:03:54,417
That's awesome.

76
00:03:54,417 --> 00:03:56,292
I'm not even wearing a dress this year.

77
00:03:56,292 --> 00:03:58,876
TODD MANNING: He

78
00:03:58,876 --> 00:04:00,083
ZACH LANIER: Backwards.

79
00:04:00,125 --> 00:04:03,918
I'm also a senior research consultant

80
00:04:03,999 --> 00:04:09,083
Just old timey net web app mobile app

81
00:04:10,334 --> 00:04:12,375
Why did we pick the GoPro.

82
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:14,334
Because Todd wanted to.

83
00:04:14,334 --> 00:04:16,751
TODD MANNING: Because I had one

84
00:04:16,751 --> 00:04:19,999
ZACH LANIER: It's

85
00:04:19,999 --> 00:04:22,083
I'm sure you have seen it

86
00:04:22,083 --> 00:04:27,334
featuring scantily clad men and women,

87
00:04:27,334 --> 00:04:30,999
on their skateboards and fall a lot.

88
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:34,167
It is Wi Fi enabled.

89
00:04:34,375 --> 00:04:38,501
It's got all of these cool features that

90
00:04:38,501 --> 00:04:40,999
to control the camera.

91
00:04:41,375 --> 00:04:43,999
One of the more interesting facts

92
00:04:43,999 --> 00:04:47,999
a company called Amberella who

93
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:51,999
not only in the GoPro

94
00:04:51,999 --> 00:04:54,999
we found to be intriguing, and so,

95
00:04:54,999 --> 00:04:57,999
another future research thing.

96
00:04:58,167 --> 00:05:01,292
We focused

97
00:05:01,292 --> 00:05:04,542
which is what we have up here.

98
00:05:04,999 --> 00:05:07,584
So a lot of details that will be

99
00:05:07,584 --> 00:05:10,959
of the hardware is a little bit different

100
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:14,334
a little bit later and plus it's really

101
00:05:14,334 --> 00:05:16,459
I can't say that

102
00:05:16,459 --> 00:05:17,709
TODD MANNING: I can.

103
00:05:17,709 --> 00:05:18,999
It's fucking extreme!

104
00:05:18,999 --> 00:05:20,751
ZACH LANIER: Mountain Dew.

105
00:05:32,667 --> 00:05:39,584
It featured an Amberella, it's

106
00:05:39,584 --> 00:05:44,999
JTAG and blah, blah, blah, blah,

107
00:05:44,999 --> 00:05:50,083
for their light sensors

108
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:56,250
on this Atheros controller,

109
00:05:56,250 --> 00:06:04,083
of stuff that's not relevant to security

110
00:06:04,083 --> 00:06:08,876
it has a lot of stuff that's not used.

111
00:06:08,999 --> 00:06:11,209
All packed

112
00:06:11,209 --> 00:06:12,375
TODD MANNING: Okay.

113
00:06:12,375 --> 00:06:13,375
I will do this one.

114
00:06:18,626 --> 00:06:21,417
I figured it was my turn to talk.

115
00:06:21,667 --> 00:06:24,417
One interesting thing,

116
00:06:24,417 --> 00:06:29,167
of found when we busted this camera

117
00:06:29,167 --> 00:06:31,083
not just one.

118
00:06:31,125 --> 00:06:33,792
So two for the price of one.

119
00:06:33,792 --> 00:06:37,792
One is the iTRON embedded operating

120
00:06:37,959 --> 00:06:41,542
It's like this open source sort

121
00:06:41,542 --> 00:06:43,667
standard really.

122
00:06:43,667 --> 00:06:46,626
So the version that runs on here

123
00:06:46,626 --> 00:06:50,876
to the standard developed

124
00:06:50,876 --> 00:06:52,334
I guess.

125
00:06:52,751 --> 00:06:57,999
So it's primarily responsible

126
00:06:57,999 --> 00:07:01,751
So capturing images, doing encoding

127
00:07:01,999 --> 00:07:04,459
And then it runs Linux kernel version

128
00:07:05,834 --> 00:07:09,250
So the realtime the ox S system works,

129
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:12,959
of threads that are

130
00:07:13,083 --> 00:07:17,459
One thread is dedicated

131
00:07:17,459 --> 00:07:22,709
the Linux operating system

132
00:07:22,709 --> 00:07:28,999
of higher order functions that deal

133
00:07:28,999 --> 00:07:33,667
like, mobile application that kind

134
00:07:33,667 --> 00:07:37,375
And so yeah.

135
00:07:37,375 --> 00:07:38,959
Two operating systems.

136
00:07:38,999 --> 00:07:41,834
There's a private network that runs

137
00:07:41,834 --> 00:07:44,334
The networking address is given here,

138
00:07:46,999 --> 00:07:52,501
The the realtime operating system side

139
00:07:52,501 --> 00:07:57,959
of handles certain requests,

140
00:07:57,959 --> 00:08:02,876
of the, like, preview mode files

141
00:08:02,876 --> 00:08:06,250
the version

142
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:09,959
server that handles actually taking

143
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:14,999
from the mobile remote control

144
00:08:14,999 --> 00:08:20,209
from that on to the realtime operating

145
00:08:20,209 --> 00:08:22,667
describe shortly.

146
00:08:27,999 --> 00:08:30,834
One second, I need some water.

147
00:08:30,834 --> 00:08:31,834
Okay.

148
00:08:31,834 --> 00:08:33,375
ZACH LANIER: This is your boy.

149
00:08:33,375 --> 00:08:35,999
TODD MANNING: So some previous

150
00:08:35,999 --> 00:08:35,999
Looking into this camera, it's like, oh,

151
00:08:35,999 --> 00:08:38,876
to know something about it,

152
00:08:38,876 --> 00:08:41,876
So the OG of like, you know,

153
00:08:41,876 --> 00:08:48,250
is this cat called evil wombat

154
00:08:50,999 --> 00:08:54,375
Likes to give information.

155
00:08:56,125 --> 00:08:58,459
He's developed a number

156
00:08:58,459 --> 00:09:00,209
on GitHub/evilwombat.

157
00:09:04,125 --> 00:09:09,083
He's an ARM firmware developer

158
00:09:09,083 --> 00:09:10,876
I know he lives on the West Coast.

159
00:09:10,876 --> 00:09:12,999
Other than that, you know,

160
00:09:12,999 --> 00:09:15,792
for more than just a few hours.

161
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:18,626
Stop dropping Docs.

162
00:09:18,626 --> 00:09:22,542
Hey, wait, sorry about that.

163
00:09:23,751 --> 00:09:27,626
So, yeah, in his repository,

164
00:09:27,626 --> 00:09:31,209
the firmware updates that come

165
00:09:31,209 --> 00:09:37,167
of do some further analysis yourself,

166
00:09:37,167 --> 00:09:39,375
He's got a tool that

167
00:09:39,375 --> 00:09:44,375
to USB and then boot your own custom

168
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:47,999
brick your camera like I have done,

169
00:09:47,999 --> 00:09:50,459
ostensibly unbrick it.

170
00:09:50,459 --> 00:09:54,083
There are some there's some cases

171
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:57,999
yeah, real nice guy that has made some

172
00:09:57,999 --> 00:10:02,876
has we have stood on the shoulders

173
00:10:02,876 --> 00:10:04,626
Evil Wombat.

174
00:10:04,626 --> 00:10:07,999
If you are here, I will buy you

175
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:09,751
to a movie.

176
00:10:09,751 --> 00:10:10,999
You are a real sweet person.

177
00:10:10,999 --> 00:10:11,999
(Laughter).

178
00:10:12,125 --> 00:10:16,501
ZACH LANIER: So one

179
00:10:16,501 --> 00:10:19,125
was this ambsh script.

180
00:10:22,751 --> 00:10:26,709
So if you put that on to the SD card

181
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:30,167
it will basically auto exec what you put

182
00:10:30,167 --> 00:10:34,375
TODD MANNING: It wasn't that

183
00:10:34,375 --> 00:10:37,042
It's rather he discovered that

184
00:10:37,042 --> 00:10:41,999
a script called autoexec.ash that's

185
00:10:41,999 --> 00:10:45,626
a number of commands and

186
00:10:45,626 --> 00:10:50,375
into understanding what it was that we

187
00:10:50,375 --> 00:10:52,250
by doing that.

188
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:53,542
ZACH LANIER: Right.

189
00:10:53,542 --> 00:10:54,542
That's better.

190
00:10:54,876 --> 00:10:59,459
And so one of the things

191
00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:04,125
in the Amberella shell called T

192
00:11:04,125 --> 00:11:09,459
of the low level control

193
00:11:09,459 --> 00:11:16,876
the T app test, USB231, it

194
00:11:17,083 --> 00:11:20,834
So it gives enthusiasm access

195
00:11:22,083 --> 00:11:24,999
There's a slew

196
00:11:24,999 --> 00:11:27,999
through even in 30 minutes.

197
00:11:27,999 --> 00:11:31,209
One of the things you shouldn't do

198
00:11:32,709 --> 00:11:35,999
Because it officially bricks your camera.

199
00:11:37,125 --> 00:11:38,751
Don't do that.

200
00:11:39,083 --> 00:11:41,876
TODD MANNING: I would say,

201
00:11:41,999 --> 00:11:44,250
When you run that command

202
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:47,626
all the NANDs comes up,

203
00:11:47,626 --> 00:11:51,250
but when you reboot,

204
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:52,334
Let me put it that way.

205
00:11:52,334 --> 00:11:54,459
ZACH LANIER: One

206
00:11:54,459 --> 00:11:55,999
at shared.

207
00:11:58,918 --> 00:12:03,626
It allows the Arthos to talk

208
00:12:03,626 --> 00:12:10,375
over an RTS channel and that allows

209
00:12:10,375 --> 00:12:15,999
to execute any command, as root

210
00:12:16,125 --> 00:12:21,584
So in this case, these snippets here,

211
00:12:21,584 --> 00:12:27,999
by evil wombat chilled

212
00:12:30,209 --> 00:12:32,292
80D goes to 80.

213
00:12:35,083 --> 00:12:39,083
That's one of the external ports that you

214
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:45,834
So it kills Cherokee and has telnet

215
00:12:46,876 --> 00:12:51,375
Hey, here, we got root on a camera,

216
00:12:53,334 --> 00:12:56,999
Todd is a bad ass.

217
00:12:58,501 --> 00:13:03,542
One of the first things we actually

218
00:13:03,542 --> 00:13:08,083
was looking at the GoPro app mode

219
00:13:08,083 --> 00:13:09,584
So it runs if one of two modes.

220
00:13:09,584 --> 00:13:10,999
Wi Fi remote or GoPro app.

221
00:13:10,999 --> 00:13:13,125
The first one is the GoPro app mode.

222
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:16,083
It allows you to install a Linux or IOS.

223
00:13:17,167 --> 00:13:19,751
It acts as an access point.

224
00:13:20,083 --> 00:13:23,125
You associate with it,

225
00:13:23,125 --> 00:13:26,334
and it connects

226
00:13:26,709 --> 00:13:30,959
The web server that it talks on 80

227
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:35,542
for a control channel

228
00:13:35,542 --> 00:13:40,250
and on 8080 it receives it streaming

229
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:42,250
What is interesting about this and

230
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:44,999
Wi Fi backpack uses 10.5.5.9.

231
00:13:47,459 --> 00:13:50,167
It uses MDS for discovery.

232
00:13:50,999 --> 00:13:55,542
But it connects to 10.5.5.9,

233
00:13:55,542 --> 00:13:57,083
I don't know if it's a fallback.

234
00:13:57,999 --> 00:14:00,083
And it uses MPEG TS.

235
00:14:02,334 --> 00:14:07,167
It continually receives this play list

236
00:14:07,667 --> 00:14:12,999
And then that file,

237
00:14:12,999 --> 00:14:15,709
that it retrieves.

238
00:14:15,709 --> 00:14:17,250
So it's not really streaming

239
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:21,125
but it's receiving these .3 second files

240
00:14:21,125 --> 00:14:25,709
the next one and playing it retrieving

241
00:14:25,709 --> 00:14:29,459
a new set of files and this just rotates

242
00:14:29,542 --> 00:14:33,999
You can actually just point Quicktime

243
00:14:33,999 --> 00:14:37,792
player you like at the MUA file

244
00:14:37,792 --> 00:14:40,959
the preview video from the camera.

245
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:42,999
Kind of turning it into a, you know,

246
00:14:42,999 --> 00:14:47,125
if you so actually were able

247
00:14:47,125 --> 00:14:50,918
TODD MANNING: We asked that

248
00:14:50,918 --> 00:14:54,751
of that offensive technology, please.

249
00:14:54,751 --> 00:14:55,959
ZACH LANIER: Right.

250
00:14:55,959 --> 00:14:58,792
So the other mode that's notable

251
00:14:58,792 --> 00:14:59,834
And this one we find

252
00:14:59,834 --> 00:15:02,999
which we can discuss

253
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:04,667
In this case,

254
00:15:04,667 --> 00:15:06,209
if we have with us, it's

255
00:15:06,209 --> 00:15:08,250
the little key chain device.

256
00:15:08,334 --> 00:15:11,167
It acts as a mobile device,

257
00:15:11,167 --> 00:15:13,792
with the smaller device.

258
00:15:17,999 --> 00:15:29,292
It goes to here rc xxxx which are

259
00:15:29,667 --> 00:15:31,083
Once it's paired, it

260
00:15:31,083 --> 00:15:32,999
and prefer that,

261
00:15:32,999 --> 00:15:34,584
to a new remote.

262
00:15:34,709 --> 00:15:36,999
So you can draw your own conclusions

263
00:15:36,999 --> 00:15:38,834
possible there.

264
00:15:38,834 --> 00:15:39,999
It's also totally open.

265
00:15:39,999 --> 00:15:42,083
There's no security whatsoever.

266
00:15:42,083 --> 00:15:45,125
So you can just associate

267
00:15:45,751 --> 00:15:47,999
We're still sort of exploring what

268
00:15:47,999 --> 00:15:50,542
about attacking the remotes.

269
00:15:50,542 --> 00:15:51,999
But anyway.

270
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:55,083
Network attack surface.

271
00:15:55,501 --> 00:15:58,375
The Cleroux key web server runs this

272
00:15:58,375 --> 00:16:01,792
on an unprivileged port

273
00:16:01,999 --> 00:16:05,083
We noticed there's absolutely no

274
00:16:05,167 --> 00:16:07,626
The compiler options and

275
00:16:07,626 --> 00:16:10,501
like on the file system of the camera.

276
00:16:10,876 --> 00:16:12,501
So you can totally have fun there.

277
00:16:12,918 --> 00:16:16,626
The executable base itself not

278
00:16:16,626 --> 00:16:20,209
of the payload is not really difficult.

279
00:16:20,209 --> 00:16:24,792
If you find

280
00:16:24,999 --> 00:16:26,999
So we're like at five minutes.

281
00:16:26,999 --> 00:16:30,417
So iTRON side    TODD MANNING:

282
00:16:31,792 --> 00:16:32,999
Okay.

283
00:16:32,999 --> 00:16:34,584
So like we said, two web servers.

284
00:16:34,626 --> 00:16:37,876
On the realtime OS side,

285
00:16:37,876 --> 00:16:41,999
there were these URLs that

286
00:16:41,999 --> 00:16:47,334
to engage different behavior

287
00:16:47,876 --> 00:16:51,834
Some are configuration type commands

288
00:16:51,834 --> 00:16:56,876
reconfigure capture settings

289
00:16:56,876 --> 00:17:01,959
start recording, stop recording,

290
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:04,250
Basically, you know,

291
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:07,999
to the Wi Fi axis point,

292
00:17:07,999 --> 00:17:12,083
and kind of reconfigure

293
00:17:12,083 --> 00:17:15,999
We are working

294
00:17:15,999 --> 00:17:18,751
acts as the control.

295
00:17:19,083 --> 00:17:22,709
Let's see, and it actually passes

296
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:26,334
and I haven't found

297
00:17:26,334 --> 00:17:31,542
and I'm not sure why that happens,

298
00:17:31,542 --> 00:17:35,083
I mean, I guess it's the key

299
00:17:35,083 --> 00:17:38,375
yeah, it seems kind of strange.

300
00:17:38,834 --> 00:17:43,083
And basically once you you know,

301
00:17:43,083 --> 00:17:47,626
in either the realtime OS or

302
00:17:47,626 --> 00:17:51,459
from the realtime OS side,

303
00:17:51,459 --> 00:17:55,250
If you find like a Cherokee bug,

304
00:17:55,250 --> 00:18:00,542
to do there too to bridge the gap

305
00:18:00,999 --> 00:18:05,999
So in terms of local attack surface,

306
00:18:05,999 --> 00:18:09,999
and so there's to privilege exception.

307
00:18:10,999 --> 00:18:14,125
Everything

308
00:18:14,125 --> 00:18:19,334
all the libraries are loaded

309
00:18:19,959 --> 00:18:23,999
The web server itself, so Cherokee

310
00:18:23,999 --> 00:18:26,999
images at hex 8000 and there's actual

311
00:18:26,999 --> 00:18:29,999
of sections that get mapped there.

312
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:34,083
Sorry, 8000 and then like hex 8300.

313
00:18:34,334 --> 00:18:39,083
Let's see, it runs busybox

314
00:18:39,083 --> 00:18:47,083
you know, busybox utilities there,

315
00:18:47,083 --> 00:18:51,083
You know, sometimes you see that

316
00:18:51,083 --> 00:18:53,626
I feel like you want to break in there,

317
00:18:53,626 --> 00:18:56,918
ZACH LANIER: So basically it's just

318
00:18:56,918 --> 00:19:00,999
but pretty much every executable base

319
00:19:00,999 --> 00:19:04,083
or always mapped

320
00:19:04,083 --> 00:19:07,709
terribly difficult to get reliable codex.

321
00:19:07,709 --> 00:19:10,083
TODD MANNING: I feel

322
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:12,334
but, you know, maybe not.

323
00:19:12,709 --> 00:19:15,792
So there are a number of, like,

324
00:19:15,792 --> 00:19:18,999
quote/unquote services that are

325
00:19:18,999 --> 00:19:24,999
A couple of them are listening

326
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:29,083
They handle JSON well, one

327
00:19:29,083 --> 00:19:34,083
messages from the ISON side,

328
00:19:36,999 --> 00:19:38,999
Basically, their mechanism

329
00:19:38,999 --> 00:19:41,876
across like these two operating

330
00:19:41,876 --> 00:19:43,876
So they share the same memory,

331
00:19:43,876 --> 00:19:47,083
like this queue based message passing

332
00:19:47,083 --> 00:19:49,876
And hey, it's a great time to talk

333
00:19:49,876 --> 00:19:54,167
ZACH LANIER: So the we're

334
00:19:54,334 --> 00:19:56,876
So we will probably breeze

335
00:19:58,083 --> 00:20:01,334
Upping IPS,

336
00:20:01,334 --> 00:20:04,999
are there and they point to the M

337
00:20:04,999 --> 00:20:09,083
is the Amberella which

338
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:11,999
to iTRON worth exploring.

339
00:20:12,375 --> 00:20:16,334
They are on the Amberella or

340
00:20:16,334 --> 00:20:19,584
shell, you can run PRAG,

341
00:20:19,584 --> 00:20:25,375
out all of these different programs that

342
00:20:25,375 --> 00:20:27,125
It's like son IPC ish.

343
00:20:27,709 --> 00:20:31,459
It maps to I aspecific program that's

344
00:20:31,459 --> 00:20:34,918
and that's basically all we will talk

345
00:20:34,918 --> 00:20:38,042
because we are running out of time.

346
00:20:38,042 --> 00:20:40,709
Future research, remote monitoring,

347
00:20:40,709 --> 00:20:43,334
like the spoke or

348
00:20:43,334 --> 00:20:45,375
the camera to spy.

349
00:20:45,834 --> 00:20:47,167
That sounds really cool.

350
00:20:47,417 --> 00:20:49,792
Next thing would be

351
00:20:49,792 --> 00:20:55,042
from the wire Wi Fi remote and

352
00:20:55,042 --> 00:20:58,918
And it's remarkably similar

353
00:21:03,792 --> 00:21:10,375
Back door persistence, blah, blah, blah,

354
00:21:10,375 --> 00:21:14,125
maybe tomorrow when we are sober.

355
00:21:14,375 --> 00:21:16,083

(Applause)    TODD MANNING: I love

365
00:21:45,792 --> 00:21:45,792
ZACH LANIER: And

366
00:21:45,792 --> 00:21:47,626
in the audience, you know where to go.

367
00:21:47,626 --> 00:21:48,626
Outside.

368
00:21:48,626 --> 00:21:50,542
TODD MANNING: I have one

369
00:21:50,542 --> 00:21:51,626
I'm going to flip you.

370
00:21:51,626 --> 00:21:51,626
Did anyone log

371
00:21:51,626 --> 00:21:52,626
Fi password?

372
00:21:52,626 --> 00:21:52,626
Did anybody if you can prove it

373
00:21:52,626 --> 00:21:54,292
will fucking give you this camera.

374
00:21:54,292 --> 00:21:55,292
I take that as a no.

375
00:21:55,292 --> 00:21:56,542
None of you are hackers.

376
00:21:56,542 --> 00:21:57,542
(Laughter).
