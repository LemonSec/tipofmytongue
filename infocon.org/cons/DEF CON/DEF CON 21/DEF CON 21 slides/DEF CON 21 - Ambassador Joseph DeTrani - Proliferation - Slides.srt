1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,459
Hi, everybody, welcome to Def Con 21.

2
00:00:03,459 --> 00:00:04,459
Yeah!

3
00:00:04,459 --> 00:00:10,999
I have already lost my voice.

4
00:00:10,999 --> 00:00:11,999
Who else?

5
00:00:11,999 --> 00:00:12,999
Anybody?

6
00:00:12,999 --> 00:00:15,876
So we wanted to have an opening speaker this morning that

7
00:00:15,876 --> 00:00:20,876
feel like they can handle the heat of the moment going on out there.

8
00:00:20,876 --> 00:00:23,918
We invited a former fed up here.

9
00:00:23,918 --> 00:00:25,959
He is used to dealing with North Korea special envoy

10
00:00:25,959 --> 00:00:30,000
for the United States so I think he can deal with the heat.

11
00:00:31,999 --> 00:00:35,417
Also Ambassador Joseph DeTrani was recently director

12
00:00:35,417 --> 00:00:38,999
of nuclear non proliferation for the United States and

13
00:00:38,999 --> 00:00:41,959
he is now president of INSA.

14
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:44,999
So I think it's really interesting to hear him talk today

15
00:00:44,999 --> 00:00:49,542
about the convergence we are seeing between cyber and nuclear.

16
00:00:49,626 --> 00:00:51,209
So with that everybody give Ambassador

17
00:00:51,209 --> 00:00:53,042
a warm welcome.

18
00:00:53,042 --> 00:00:55,000
(Applause).

19
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,375
AMBASSADOR JOSEPH DETRANI: Thank you.

20
00:01:00,751 --> 00:01:02,209
It's an honor being here.

21
00:01:02,667 --> 00:01:07,959
I have to be very honest, it's a bit intimidating to be here.

22
00:01:07,959 --> 00:01:09,667
I'm impressed with all of the work you do,

23
00:01:09,667 --> 00:01:12,999
and I met some of your colleagues yesterday.

24
00:01:12,999 --> 00:01:13,959
Nico was nice enough to take me around, and

25
00:01:13,959 --> 00:01:16,709
the work you do is very, very impressive.

26
00:01:16,709 --> 00:01:21,292
I 've spent ten years working weapons of mass destruction issues a lot

27
00:01:21,292 --> 00:01:25,542
in North Korea, but a number of other countries we look

28
00:01:25,542 --> 00:01:31,501
at weapons of mass destruction, nuclear what was that, I'm sorry?

29
00:01:31,501 --> 00:01:33,083
Nuclear, bio and chemical.

30
00:01:33,083 --> 00:01:35,501
I thought today maybe I could talk a little about that and sort

31
00:01:35,501 --> 00:01:38,125
of weave that into some of the work you are doing where you

32
00:01:38,125 --> 00:01:41,334
have the expertise, and that's the cyber domain.

33
00:01:41,501 --> 00:01:45,542
So please, bear with me, and then maybe we could open it

34
00:01:45,542 --> 00:01:49,459
up for discussion or some questions.

35
00:01:49,667 --> 00:01:51,626
And I'll be telling you a lot of what you know,

36
00:01:51,626 --> 00:01:55,083
but let me start talking about weapons of mass destruction.

37
00:01:55,250 --> 00:02:00,959
And I will preview that by giving you my sense that cyber

38
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:07,626
is a major national security threat to this country, to our citizens,

39
00:02:07,626 --> 00:02:10,209
to our companies.

40
00:02:10,209 --> 00:02:13,999
It's a threat that's growing in scope with direct impact to the economic,

41
00:02:13,999 --> 00:02:17,918
domestic and defense interests of this nation.

42
00:02:17,999 --> 00:02:22,083
Hactivists with politically or socially motivated agenda,

43
00:02:22,083 --> 00:02:25,876
to criminals to state and non state actors who view

44
00:02:25,876 --> 00:02:30,375
cyber intrusions and attacks as a means of economic advancement,

45
00:02:30,375 --> 00:02:34,999
and we see a lot of that, through theft of intellectual property

46
00:02:34,999 --> 00:02:39,125
and we have been reading a lot about that, or espionage or

47
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:42,584
in the most extreme case as a potential weapons

48
00:02:42,584 --> 00:02:44,999
of mass destruction.

49
00:02:45,501 --> 00:02:49,334
The cyber domain shows some of the same issues I've addressed

50
00:02:49,334 --> 00:02:54,125
in my many years working weapons of mass destruction issues.

51
00:02:54,209 --> 00:02:57,792
Let me talk a little bit about weapons of mass destruction.

52
00:02:57,999 --> 00:03:00,083
The non proliferation treaty, NPT and

53
00:03:00,083 --> 00:03:03,959
the International Atomic Energy Agency were established

54
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:07,751
to address nuclear issues with significant international

55
00:03:07,751 --> 00:03:12,334
membership that interestingly and unfortunately doesn't include four

56
00:03:12,334 --> 00:03:17,209
of the nine nuclear weapons states as members of the NPT.

57
00:03:18,876 --> 00:03:22,959
The reality is that the number of nuclear weapon states could

58
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:25,959
increase significantly if North Korea retains

59
00:03:25,959 --> 00:03:29,542
and enhances nuclear weapon capabilities and Iran pulls

60
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:33,876
the trigger and manufactures nuclear weapons which they could do

61
00:03:33,876 --> 00:03:36,918
in a few months once the Supreme Leader Amini,

62
00:03:36,918 --> 00:03:41,417
makes this decision which some say is inevitable despite the election

63
00:03:41,417 --> 00:03:44,501
of Rohani as the new president.

64
00:03:45,751 --> 00:03:49,792
These two events in my view, in my view, will insight

65
00:03:49,792 --> 00:03:54,209
an international nuclear arms race with countries like Japan

66
00:03:54,209 --> 00:03:57,792
and South Korea in East Asia and Saudi, Turkey

67
00:03:57,792 --> 00:04:01,999
in the Middle East each seeking to attain their nuclear

68
00:04:01,999 --> 00:04:04,292
weapons capability.

69
00:04:04,792 --> 00:04:08,459
This is the nuclear threat the international community confronts

70
00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:12,751
today in addition to the real threat, and I emphasize new threat

71
00:04:12,751 --> 00:04:15,083
of nuclear terrorism.

72
00:04:15,083 --> 00:04:17,999
Non state actors getting their hands on nuclear devices,

73
00:04:17,999 --> 00:04:20,501
which we know they want.

74
00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:27,083
That's why these organizations the non proliferation, IAEA,

75
00:04:27,083 --> 00:04:32,876
the International Atomic Agency, the monitorings of these

76
00:04:32,876 --> 00:04:38,709
at Iran's nuclear sites do such outstanding work.

77
00:04:40,834 --> 00:04:45,083
North Korea pulled out of the NPT and they did that in 2013,

78
00:04:45,083 --> 00:04:49,918
thus there are no IAEA inspectors looking at North Korea, looking

79
00:04:49,918 --> 00:04:55,959
at their facility and any other undeclared facilities in North Korea.

80
00:04:56,125 --> 00:04:58,125
Membership in the NPT and compliance

81
00:04:58,125 --> 00:05:01,334
with the IAEA safeguards helps to insure that

82
00:05:01,334 --> 00:05:05,501
a nuclear arms race does not materialize and that countries

83
00:05:05,501 --> 00:05:09,626
like North Korea dismantles nuclear weapons.

84
00:05:11,834 --> 00:05:14,959
As chairman promised and Iran renounces the pursuit

85
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:18,167
of nuclear weapons and overtly pursues the peaceful use

86
00:05:18,167 --> 00:05:22,542
of nuclear energy while also insuring that those other nuclear weapons

87
00:05:22,542 --> 00:05:26,542
states work hard to insure the security of their nuclear weapons,

88
00:05:26,542 --> 00:05:28,876
the security of their nuclear weapons

89
00:05:28,876 --> 00:05:33,999
because I mentioned nuclear terrorism, and eventually join the U.S.

90
00:05:33,999 --> 00:05:37,667
in its goal in a world with no nuclear weapons.

91
00:05:37,999 --> 00:05:39,999
The president has made that clear, the objective, and

92
00:05:39,999 --> 00:05:42,834
he said most likely not in his lifetime.

93
00:05:43,999 --> 00:05:47,834
Unfortunately there are no international organizations with the stature

94
00:05:47,834 --> 00:05:51,999
and effect of the NPT and IAEA to oversee the cybersecurity.

95
00:05:52,292 --> 00:05:55,584
Additionally the IAEA promotes peaceful use

96
00:05:55,584 --> 00:06:01,751
of nuclear energy while trying to for military for nuclear purposes.

97
00:06:04,125 --> 00:06:07,083
Regional and national forums have discussed the future

98
00:06:07,083 --> 00:06:11,334
of internet governance, but there has been minimal progress.

99
00:06:11,834 --> 00:06:14,626
Indeed the very definition of the cyber domain remains blurred,

100
00:06:14,626 --> 00:06:18,918
but is not confined to the borders of any particular country.

101
00:06:18,999 --> 00:06:21,999
As the Council of Foreign Relation's recent report

102
00:06:21,999 --> 00:06:25,834
from the independent task force on cybersecurity noted addressing

103
00:06:25,834 --> 00:06:29,542
the challenge of cyberspace is a global matter.

104
00:06:29,709 --> 00:06:33,501
And, quote, the effects of domestic decisions spread far

105
00:06:33,501 --> 00:06:37,999
beyond national borders and will affect not only users, companies,

106
00:06:37,999 --> 00:06:42,584
non governmental organizations, and policymakers in other countries

107
00:06:42,584 --> 00:06:46,334
but also the health, stability, resilience and integrity

108
00:06:46,334 --> 00:06:49,999
of the global internet closed quotes.

109
00:06:50,083 --> 00:06:54,792
International approaches to cybersecurity are critical.

110
00:06:55,083 --> 00:06:57,667
Yet fraud with challenges of balancing free trade

111
00:06:57,667 --> 00:07:00,584
with a global regulatory framework and protection

112
00:07:00,584 --> 00:07:04,918
of intellectual property promoting national security including security

113
00:07:04,918 --> 00:07:09,209
of critical infrastructure and protecting privacy where national standards

114
00:07:09,209 --> 00:07:12,584
on this issue differ across the globe.

115
00:07:12,792 --> 00:07:15,083
Let me talk about the U.S.

116
00:07:15,083 --> 00:07:15,999
executive order on improving critical

117
00:07:15,999 --> 00:07:18,250
infrastructure cybersecurity.

118
00:07:18,334 --> 00:07:23,375
It's very explicit, and I think you are all familiar with the executive order,

119
00:07:23,375 --> 00:07:26,584
explicit in stating that, quote, the cyber threat

120
00:07:26,584 --> 00:07:30,667
to critical infrastructure continues to grow and represents one

121
00:07:30,667 --> 00:07:35,876
of the most serious national security challenges we now confront.

122
00:07:36,125 --> 00:07:39,292
The national and economic security of the United States depends

123
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:42,459
on reliable functioning of the nation's critical infrastructure

124
00:07:42,459 --> 00:07:44,918
in the face of such threats.

125
00:07:44,999 --> 00:07:47,959
It is the policy of the United States to enhance

126
00:07:47,959 --> 00:07:51,959
the security and resilience of the nation's critical infrastructure

127
00:07:51,959 --> 00:07:54,999
and to maintain a cyber environment that encourages

128
00:07:54,999 --> 00:07:57,999
efficiency, innovation, and economic prosperity while

129
00:07:57,999 --> 00:08:01,751
promoting safety, security, business confidentiality, privacy

130
00:08:01,751 --> 00:08:03,999
and civil liberties.

131
00:08:03,999 --> 00:08:05,999
We can achieve these goals through a partnership

132
00:08:05,999 --> 00:08:09,125
with the owners and operators of critical infrastructure

133
00:08:09,125 --> 00:08:13,417
to improve cybersecurity information sharing and collaboratively develop

134
00:08:13,417 --> 00:08:18,125
and implement risk base that's a quote from the executive order.

135
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:22,083
You will have a chance to ask questions and we can have

136
00:08:22,083 --> 00:08:23,834
a conversation.

137
00:08:23,999 --> 00:08:26,083
In the global information age, computers and

138
00:08:26,083 --> 00:08:29,999
the internet are integral to every aspect of society, education,

139
00:08:29,999 --> 00:08:32,709
healthcare, economic growth.

140
00:08:32,709 --> 00:08:33,999
No area is untouched.

141
00:08:34,417 --> 00:08:37,125
Robert Macky who has been here writing for the Council

142
00:08:37,125 --> 00:08:40,292
of Foreign Affairs and I quote, the tremendous gains

143
00:08:40,292 --> 00:08:43,626
in economic productivity over the past two decades are

144
00:08:43,626 --> 00:08:46,584
the direct result of the expanded use of internet

145
00:08:46,584 --> 00:08:49,709
for communications collaboration, outsourcing, just

146
00:08:49,709 --> 00:08:54,918
in time inventory management and the control of industrial processes.

147
00:08:55,083 --> 00:08:58,292
Internationally the surge in global trade in both goods

148
00:08:58,292 --> 00:09:03,375
and services that has taken place could not have happened without internet

149
00:09:03,375 --> 00:09:07,167
as an enabling technology, closed quotes.

150
00:09:07,501 --> 00:09:10,417
As with many peaceful and beneficial uses of nuclear power,

151
00:09:10,417 --> 00:09:13,417
there obviously are many peaceful socioeconomic uses

152
00:09:13,417 --> 00:09:15,999
of information technology.

153
00:09:15,999 --> 00:09:19,542
I believe it would be a mistake, however, to think that cyber presently

154
00:09:19,542 --> 00:09:22,918
can be used as a tool to counter real or potential nuclear threats

155
00:09:22,918 --> 00:09:24,918
as some have argued.

156
00:09:24,999 --> 00:09:32,999
They cite and its reported effectiveness in disabling a nuclear threat.

157
00:09:33,459 --> 00:09:35,999
And I think many of you are familiar

158
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:40,250
with disabling a certain number of centrifuges.

159
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:50,083
Beyond the reach of any so-called cyber capability.

160
00:09:50,083 --> 00:09:53,125
As stated in the aforementioned U.S.

161
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:54,751
executive order, cyber's true harmful capacity

162
00:09:54,751 --> 00:09:57,083
in addition to stealing intellectual property

163
00:09:57,083 --> 00:10:00,667
is its potential to attack a country's critical infrastructure,

164
00:10:00,667 --> 00:10:03,209
its grid, water supply, aviation safety systems,

165
00:10:03,209 --> 00:10:07,999
communications, financial system, things are all very familiar with.

166
00:10:08,125 --> 00:10:11,999
It's a tax of this nature that makes cyber as potentially harmful as those

167
00:10:11,999 --> 00:10:15,999
of biological and nuclear attacks, and, therefore, must be approached

168
00:10:15,999 --> 00:10:19,626
with equal seriousness and focus on prevention.

169
00:10:19,999 --> 00:10:23,999
Theoretically any country or person or organization can conduct such

170
00:10:23,999 --> 00:10:27,334
a tax assuming knowledge and capacity.

171
00:10:27,334 --> 00:10:29,292
That's not the case with nuclear.

172
00:10:29,292 --> 00:10:31,000
Given the finite number of nuclear weapon states and

173
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,167
the likelihood that if they use, and I emphasize

174
00:10:33,167 --> 00:10:35,501
if they use nuclear weapons against another country

175
00:10:35,501 --> 00:10:37,959
they in turn would be attacked.

176
00:10:38,542 --> 00:10:40,999
Mutual assured destruction.

177
00:10:40,999 --> 00:10:44,292
Having nuclear weapons is a deterrent to nuclear attack.

178
00:10:46,792 --> 00:10:50,709
If an event occurred one can assume who the cyber perpetrator was,

179
00:10:50,709 --> 00:10:54,417
but the forensic fingerprint is less apparent, thus making such

180
00:10:54,417 --> 00:10:58,709
an attack potentially more attractive to an aggressor.

181
00:10:58,709 --> 00:11:02,999
I cite the recent attacks against Saudi Arabia, Georgia and

182
00:11:02,999 --> 00:11:05,626
the United States.

183
00:11:05,626 --> 00:11:07,292
Their impact was devastating.

184
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:10,999
That was not the case with nuclear as we mentioned and

185
00:11:10,999 --> 00:11:15,250
for that very reason more must be done to insure that cyber technology

186
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:18,125
is not used for those purposes.

187
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:20,999
The leverages for the international community

188
00:11:20,999 --> 00:11:23,751
and respective governments in addition

189
00:11:23,751 --> 00:11:27,876
to using cyber more effectively for socioeconomic purposes

190
00:11:27,876 --> 00:11:31,999
to help create firewalls necessary to stop cyber attack or

191
00:11:31,999 --> 00:11:36,417
for attacking a country's critical infrastructure.

192
00:11:36,876 --> 00:11:38,999
While also addressing the international challenge

193
00:11:38,999 --> 00:11:41,083
of agreements on policies that protect free trade

194
00:11:41,083 --> 00:11:44,083
and international governance of the internet.

195
00:11:44,083 --> 00:11:46,083
This is the challenge and responsibility confronting

196
00:11:46,083 --> 00:11:48,584
the international community.

197
00:11:48,626 --> 00:11:52,709
Moreover cyber technology generically can be used to get countries

198
00:11:52,709 --> 00:11:56,999
and non state actives from establishing and sustaining illicit

199
00:11:56,999 --> 00:12:01,542
programs while each state doctrinally is studying the role of cyber

200
00:12:01,542 --> 00:12:03,999
for military conflict.

201
00:12:04,334 --> 00:12:09,709
In my view it requires international organizations that oversee, manage

202
00:12:09,709 --> 00:12:14,999
and help control the use of cyber, organizations that not only monitor

203
00:12:14,999 --> 00:12:18,459
the use of cyber, but encourage the peaceful use

204
00:12:18,459 --> 00:12:23,999
of cyber and permit and aid other countries as we do in the nuclear field,

205
00:12:23,999 --> 00:12:29,584
other countries to benefit from these technological advances.

206
00:12:29,584 --> 00:12:33,209
In addition, the need for an international cyberware treaty,

207
00:12:33,209 --> 00:12:35,626
as was made for chemical weapons

208
00:12:35,626 --> 00:12:39,334
after we realized the terrible damage that it caused

209
00:12:39,334 --> 00:12:43,083
in World War I, I believe the nuclear issue requires

210
00:12:43,083 --> 00:12:45,209
enhanced focus.

211
00:12:45,209 --> 00:12:46,999
I will go back to the nuclear issue.

212
00:12:46,999 --> 00:12:48,999
This is my area of focus, insuring that North Korea gives

213
00:12:48,999 --> 00:12:51,584
up nuclear weapons and Iran unequivocally renounces

214
00:12:51,584 --> 00:12:54,083
pursuit after nuclear weapons.

215
00:12:54,083 --> 00:12:56,167
This is the progress U.S.

216
00:12:56,167 --> 00:13:02,250
and Russia are making with new start, bringing down the number to 1550.

217
00:13:02,334 --> 00:13:04,999
The president spoke about bringing it down to 1,000.

218
00:13:04,999 --> 00:13:05,709
We will put the international community

219
00:13:05,709 --> 00:13:09,292
on the road towards a world with no nuclear weapons.

220
00:13:12,209 --> 00:13:15,501
Robert Oppenheimer understood the need to move

221
00:13:15,501 --> 00:13:19,792
in this direction when he observed that the first detonation

222
00:13:19,792 --> 00:13:24,999
of a nuclear device on July 16th, 1945, citing Hindu scripture that, quote,

223
00:13:24,999 --> 00:13:28,999
I am become death, destroyer of the world.

224
00:13:29,417 --> 00:13:32,999
We have the opportunity and obligation to move in a different direction, not

225
00:13:32,999 --> 00:13:35,918
to destroy the world, but to enhance it.

226
00:13:35,918 --> 00:13:39,999
Most of you are experts in the field of information technology.

227
00:13:39,999 --> 00:13:42,626
You understand the cyber domain.

228
00:13:42,709 --> 00:13:46,834
You understand its beneficial impact on all of our lives.

229
00:13:46,834 --> 00:13:48,626
You also understand the harm it can cause

230
00:13:48,626 --> 00:13:50,876
if used improperly.

231
00:13:50,876 --> 00:13:52,999
Indeed we look to you to develop better tools

232
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:56,999
and help establish policies, and I emphasize this, policies

233
00:13:56,999 --> 00:14:00,209
to fortify and protect networks.

234
00:14:00,209 --> 00:14:04,083
We look to you to develop more secure systems,

235
00:14:04,083 --> 00:14:10,751
to help discover terrorist plots, to uncover human trafficking,

236
00:14:10,751 --> 00:14:14,542
corruption in WMD programs.

237
00:14:14,542 --> 00:14:18,918
We look to you to inspire others to organize and enlist good hackers

238
00:14:18,918 --> 00:14:21,999
to help combat the sinister hackers who steal

239
00:14:21,999 --> 00:14:26,999
intellectual property, disrupt networks, interfere with communications,

240
00:14:26,999 --> 00:14:30,584
banking and critical infrastructure.

241
00:14:30,584 --> 00:14:35,999
Our private and public sectors need your help, need your expertise

242
00:14:35,999 --> 00:14:38,501
to serve society.

243
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:42,999
Using technology wisely has always been the measure

244
00:14:42,999 --> 00:14:45,999
of an enlightened society.

245
00:14:46,584 --> 00:14:52,959
The security of our nation needs you, the good hackers of Def Con.

246
00:14:53,751 --> 00:14:56,167
I will end on that and maybe we can open it

247
00:14:56,167 --> 00:15:00,459
to discussions or questions or wherever you want to go.

248
00:15:03,792 --> 00:15:05,083
Thanks.

249
00:15:08,334 --> 00:15:09,792
(Applause).

250
00:15:12,999 --> 00:15:14,834
Please, sir.

251
00:15:17,999 --> 00:15:56,501
I'm sorry, we have a question here.

252
00:15:56,501 --> 00:15:58,999
(Speaking off mic).

253
00:15:58,999 --> 00:16:01,542
Do we want to take this or do you want to ask?

254
00:16:01,792 --> 00:16:03,709
Do we want to take this question first?

255
00:16:04,292 --> 00:16:06,209
Repeat the question.

256
00:16:06,209 --> 00:16:07,999
No, you, you repeat the question.

257
00:16:13,959 --> 00:16:16,542
I'm going to repeat the question.

258
00:16:17,999 --> 00:16:19,250
(Applause).

259
00:16:20,751 --> 00:16:23,083
Monitoring by the government could be a tool

260
00:16:23,083 --> 00:16:25,542
of repression, and the assurances necessary

261
00:16:25,542 --> 00:16:28,918
to assure that the government is not doing, I assume that's

262
00:16:28,918 --> 00:16:31,834
the question, it is not doing that?

263
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:37,083
Let me tell you I have been working WMD for ten years, ten years.

264
00:16:37,083 --> 00:16:38,751
I have been working North Korea, I have been working a lot

265
00:16:38,751 --> 00:16:40,250
of other issues.

266
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:41,999
What about Iraq?

267
00:16:41,999 --> 00:16:43,709
I have been working a lot of other issues if it relates

268
00:16:43,709 --> 00:16:45,999
to weapons of mass destruction.

269
00:16:46,667 --> 00:16:50,667
I can tell you this, if you want to get to what we have been talking

270
00:16:50,667 --> 00:16:54,626
about with the Snowden disclosures and so forth my exposure to that

271
00:16:54,626 --> 00:16:57,999
is what you have been exposed to is that those programs,

272
00:16:57,999 --> 00:17:02,918
those programs were authorized by the three branches of government.

273
00:17:04,999 --> 00:17:08,250
Those programs, the three branches of government provided oversight

274
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:11,999
of those programs and those programs were established post 9/11 when we

275
00:17:11,999 --> 00:17:14,334
saw the devastation of 9/11 and when we saw where

276
00:17:14,334 --> 00:17:17,999
the terrorists were coming and what their intent was.

277
00:17:17,999 --> 00:17:19,083
So you have the three branches of government authorizing

278
00:17:19,083 --> 00:17:20,792
and overseeing it.

279
00:17:22,999 --> 00:17:25,083
That's what it was.

280
00:17:25,292 --> 00:17:28,083
And they have been effective according to the record.

281
00:17:28,334 --> 00:17:30,626
The fact of the matter is a decision has been made

282
00:17:30,626 --> 00:17:34,250
to make this more overt and more of a discussion.

283
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:36,999
I don't pretend to be an expert or have the knowledge you have,

284
00:17:36,999 --> 00:17:40,334
but I think you have to have an open mind if there is a discussion,

285
00:17:40,334 --> 00:17:43,999
participate in that discussion in a meaningful way.

286
00:17:44,918 --> 00:17:47,292
Listen to let me finish my statement.

287
00:17:50,999 --> 00:17:52,999
Do it in a meaningful way.

288
00:17:52,999 --> 00:17:54,334
Listen to both sides of it.

289
00:17:54,334 --> 00:17:55,876
Listen to what the thread is.

290
00:17:55,876 --> 00:17:57,417
Listen to what they are doing because everything I have heard,

291
00:17:57,417 --> 00:18:00,375
they are not getting into anyone's mail, they are not reading anything,

292
00:18:00,375 --> 00:18:02,709
they are not touching any U.S.

293
00:18:02,709 --> 00:18:04,542
persons, this is not directed at U.S.

294
00:18:04,959 --> 00:18:07,999
citizens, this is looking at foreign terrorist threats

295
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:09,999
to the country.

296
00:18:10,083 --> 00:18:13,918
Look at the facts and then draw your own conclusions, but there

297
00:18:13,918 --> 00:18:16,792
will be a discussion on them.

298
00:18:16,792 --> 00:18:17,999
How do we know?

299
00:18:17,999 --> 00:18:19,584
You have access to the media.

300
00:18:19,584 --> 00:18:21,999
The media said there will be more of a discussion.

301
00:18:30,083 --> 00:18:34,999
No, what I'm talking about, being there are no the question

302
00:18:34,999 --> 00:18:39,250
is putting up firewalls, when I say putting up firewalls,

303
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:44,584
how do we protect, because the internet has no borders.

304
00:18:44,792 --> 00:18:45,918
It's global.

305
00:18:45,918 --> 00:18:49,083
How do companies protect their intellectual property?

306
00:18:49,083 --> 00:18:52,167
How do governments protect their critical infrastructure?

307
00:18:52,167 --> 00:18:53,999
Putting up firewalls, looking at securing networks,

308
00:18:53,999 --> 00:18:57,999
doing what's necessary to insure that we are protecting our

309
00:18:57,999 --> 00:19:00,792
intellectual property, we are protecting our

310
00:19:00,792 --> 00:19:03,209
critical infrastructure.

311
00:19:09,501 --> 00:19:12,876
No, no, no, you misunderstood, I was talking about I'm talking

312
00:19:12,876 --> 00:19:16,584
about I'm talking about international organizations.

313
00:19:16,584 --> 00:19:19,250
I mentioned the IAEA, that's an international organization, NPT

314
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:22,209
is an international organization.

315
00:19:22,209 --> 00:19:24,375
That's what I'm talking about, creating organizations that

316
00:19:24,375 --> 00:19:25,999
oversee this.

317
00:19:25,999 --> 00:19:29,999
This is not a nation issue, it's not country specific issue.

318
00:19:29,999 --> 00:19:32,083
This is a global and international issue.

319
00:19:32,083 --> 00:19:34,292
Creating international organizations that will do exactly that

320
00:19:34,292 --> 00:19:36,999
because of the concerns you have.

321
00:19:36,999 --> 00:19:40,626
And there is valid concerns, both of your questions are very valid.

322
00:19:40,999 --> 00:19:42,167
Sir?

323
00:19:56,083 --> 00:19:57,542
Thanks.

324
00:20:11,417 --> 00:20:13,542
(Speaking off mic).

325
00:20:27,417 --> 00:20:28,959
That's very good.

326
00:20:28,959 --> 00:20:30,959
The question, the question from the gentleman

327
00:20:30,959 --> 00:20:35,000
is the policy that's being made by individuals that don't really

328
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,959
understand the impact and the consequences

329
00:20:37,959 --> 00:20:40,834
for making that policy and indeed inhibiting

330
00:20:40,834 --> 00:20:46,459
and possibly persecuting individuals that want to move forward on that.

331
00:20:46,459 --> 00:20:49,999
Let me just say, that's why you all can make a difference.

332
00:20:50,042 --> 00:20:52,459
You have the expertise.

333
00:20:52,459 --> 00:20:54,834
And you are not all old white men.

334
00:20:54,999 --> 00:20:56,000
I look around.

335
00:20:56,584 --> 00:20:58,167
You could make the difference.

336
00:20:58,167 --> 00:20:59,876
You can get involved.

337
00:20:59,999 --> 00:21:01,999
You can have that impact.

338
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:05,083
Now, you can have that impact also with your representatives,

339
00:21:05,083 --> 00:21:07,459
because this is a representative government, right,

340
00:21:07,459 --> 00:21:09,083
it's' republic.

341
00:21:09,167 --> 00:21:10,999
Make your impact with your representatives

342
00:21:10,999 --> 00:21:13,501
and get involved in the issues.

343
00:21:13,501 --> 00:21:15,334
I can't emphasize that enough.

344
00:21:15,334 --> 00:21:16,334
Okay.

345
00:21:16,626 --> 00:21:19,292
Guys, we have a Microphone to use for Q and A.

346
00:21:19,292 --> 00:21:22,999
So if you could form a line over here.

347
00:21:49,292 --> 00:21:50,999
(Speaking off mic).

348
00:21:50,999 --> 00:21:52,876
Can I ask a favor of you, if you would be kind enough, sir,

349
00:21:52,876 --> 00:21:55,751
to come up and use the mic, I think the lady is absolutely right,

350
00:21:55,751 --> 00:21:57,918
so everybody can hear it.

351
00:22:01,209 --> 00:22:05,417
Sorry, I was going to say that I appreciate your response.

352
00:22:05,417 --> 00:22:07,083
The only thing I was going to say was that

353
00:22:07,083 --> 00:22:11,834
in the security research division that we have right now, the way it is,

354
00:22:11,834 --> 00:22:15,999
the way things are right now, if someone uncovers a security flaw,

355
00:22:15,999 --> 00:22:18,999
they have to watch for government prosecution

356
00:22:18,999 --> 00:22:22,542
for being sued by, you know, Cisco or some other company

357
00:22:22,542 --> 00:22:27,083
because they are uncovering a flaw and they are making public knowledge

358
00:22:27,083 --> 00:22:32,334
of a security issue, and it's not really in their best interest to, like you said,

359
00:22:32,334 --> 00:22:36,584
to participate in that theater because they are basically opening

360
00:22:36,584 --> 00:22:39,083
themselves up to attack.

361
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:44,083
Yes, look, the only thing I can say in that and I don't pretend to be

362
00:22:44,083 --> 00:22:48,834
an expert, this is really, cyber domain is not my area, but my sense

363
00:22:48,834 --> 00:22:52,999
of working issues that somewhat are related because I see cyber

364
00:22:52,999 --> 00:22:57,334
as being potentially a weapons of mass destruction when you look

365
00:22:57,334 --> 00:23:02,751
at the consequences and the need to get ahold in a global sense.

366
00:23:02,792 --> 00:23:06,083
That's why I cite the IAEA, I cite the NPT.

367
00:23:06,584 --> 00:23:09,167
This is something we have to come together on and we have

368
00:23:09,167 --> 00:23:11,083
to do it quickly.

369
00:23:11,999 --> 00:23:14,709
Further to your question, that's exactly it.

370
00:23:15,083 --> 00:23:18,999
I mean, so that when we find, the individuals find fault, they look

371
00:23:18,999 --> 00:23:23,083
at networks, they shouldn't be intimidated by that.

372
00:23:23,083 --> 00:23:25,292
They should be rewarded for doing that, to protect intellectual property,

373
00:23:25,292 --> 00:23:27,999
to protect infrastructure and so forth.

374
00:23:27,999 --> 00:23:29,083
That's all positive.

375
00:23:29,501 --> 00:23:33,083
I think what you are saying makes sense and I think working as,

376
00:23:33,083 --> 00:23:36,417
not necessarily as a team, but certainly as a team,

377
00:23:36,417 --> 00:23:39,626
but galvanizing that, and look what you have here

378
00:23:39,626 --> 00:23:41,250
at Def Con.

379
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:42,999
Yesterday you had black hat.

380
00:23:42,999 --> 00:23:46,417
The whole cyber issue has a lot of traction, this is the time

381
00:23:46,417 --> 00:23:50,501
to come together on that, working with representatives, getting involved,

382
00:23:50,501 --> 00:23:53,999
getting involved with let me say and I know this sounds trite,

383
00:23:53,999 --> 00:23:56,709
but getting the jobs with the private sector many

384
00:23:56,709 --> 00:23:59,501
of you are doing, getting jobs with the government,

385
00:23:59,501 --> 00:24:03,751
getting very much involved, so you become the new culture.

386
00:24:03,876 --> 00:24:06,709
And it's not just as you described, the old white men making these

387
00:24:06,709 --> 00:24:08,667
decisions and so forth.

388
00:24:08,667 --> 00:24:10,292
You become and you move us in this new domain which has

389
00:24:10,292 --> 00:24:12,584
significant consequences.

390
00:24:12,584 --> 00:24:14,542
So I think your questions are very good.

391
00:24:14,542 --> 00:24:15,542
Thank you.

392
00:24:15,876 --> 00:24:18,626
So I'm not really sure why you are here because you don't,

393
00:24:18,626 --> 00:24:21,959
and you said you are not an expert on anything    I'm sorry,

394
00:24:21,959 --> 00:24:23,918
I didn't hear you.

395
00:24:23,918 --> 00:24:27,083
I'm not really sure why you are here, but since you are here

396
00:24:27,083 --> 00:24:30,999
and talking about weapons of mass destruction    I'm here

397
00:24:30,999 --> 00:24:33,584
because I was invited.

398
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:38,751
The point being we just spent ten years killing 100,000 people in Iraq

399
00:24:38,751 --> 00:24:42,083
for weapons of mass destruction which appears

400
00:24:42,083 --> 00:24:44,709
to be your expertise.

401
00:24:44,709 --> 00:24:47,083
I'd like your comments on the lies that got us

402
00:24:47,083 --> 00:24:49,417
into that where people like you came

403
00:24:49,417 --> 00:24:52,417
out with the propaganda that there were weapons

404
00:24:52,417 --> 00:24:56,792
of mass destruction everywhere, that they were imminent to be used,

405
00:24:56,792 --> 00:25:00,999
that they weren't there, and that all of that government propaganda

406
00:25:00,999 --> 00:25:06,918
is lies and why shouldn't we consider that what you are saying now is lies?

407
00:25:07,209 --> 00:25:08,334
(Applause).

408
00:25:08,751 --> 00:25:13,209
Because I don't think the feds tell the truth and I think we should fuck

409
00:25:13,209 --> 00:25:14,959
the feds.

410
00:25:14,959 --> 00:25:16,999
Let me ask you a question.

411
00:25:16,999 --> 00:25:18,918
You could assume whatever you want.

412
00:25:18,999 --> 00:25:21,250
I'm listening, I'm not assuming.

413
00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:23,334
You can assume whatever you want.

414
00:25:24,876 --> 00:25:26,459
Let me finish.

415
00:25:26,999 --> 00:25:29,918
You can assume whatever you want, but if you want to be blinded

416
00:25:29,918 --> 00:25:33,999
to what's happening, you want to be blinded to the terrorism threat.

417
00:25:36,876 --> 00:25:39,999
9/11 was not a reality.

418
00:25:39,999 --> 00:25:43,250
Was 9/11 caused by weapons of mass destruction?

419
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:44,999
We want to be blinded.

420
00:25:44,999 --> 00:25:46,083
We will listen to you.

421
00:25:46,083 --> 00:25:48,876
Why did we go to Iraq and kill those people?

422
00:25:48,876 --> 00:25:50,334
The government told us because it was because of weapons

423
00:25:50,334 --> 00:25:52,083
of mass destruction.

424
00:25:55,083 --> 00:26:02,626
We have a 50% death rate and a 30%    Let me just say something.

425
00:26:02,999 --> 00:26:08,501
In my presentation this morning, I was not talking about Iraq.

426
00:26:08,999 --> 00:26:14,999
That's what we want to talk about it, weapons of mass destruction.

427
00:26:14,999 --> 00:26:16,626
The fact of the matter is and I'm not going back

428
00:26:16,626 --> 00:26:18,999
to the history on this because I think the record

429
00:26:18,999 --> 00:26:22,125
is very clear that Saddam did not have weapons at that time and

430
00:26:22,125 --> 00:26:24,999
the government has said that clearly.

431
00:26:24,999 --> 00:26:27,167
The fact is when you go back to the first Gulf War,

432
00:26:27,167 --> 00:26:29,667
when you go back to what Saddam was doing,

433
00:26:29,667 --> 00:26:32,999
when you go back to plans, to the scientists working on it,

434
00:26:32,999 --> 00:26:36,250
Saddam was pursuing it years before that.

435
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:38,375
At the moment, at that time, no.

436
00:26:38,375 --> 00:26:40,292
And I think the record is clear on that.

437
00:26:40,292 --> 00:26:43,083
The fact of the matter is Syria with chemical weapons.

438
00:26:43,083 --> 00:26:46,209
It should not blind you to the fact that Iran goes forward

439
00:26:46,209 --> 00:26:48,584
with nuclear weapons.

440
00:26:48,584 --> 00:26:50,999
It shouldn't blind you to the fact that terrorist organizations

441
00:26:50,999 --> 00:26:54,417
are trying to get their hands on the material.

442
00:26:54,417 --> 00:26:55,999
And the reality that the government is lying

443
00:26:55,999 --> 00:26:58,250
about those things as well.

444
00:26:58,542 --> 00:27:02,792
The terrorists may be there and the government is lying to cover it up.

445
00:27:02,792 --> 00:27:05,417
You can believe what you want, but I can tell you we have a lot

446
00:27:05,417 --> 00:27:09,250
of dedicated Americans working these issues who care about the safety

447
00:27:09,250 --> 00:27:12,834
of American people, care about the safety of you and all of us

448
00:27:12,834 --> 00:27:16,751
in this room and spend time doing that because we know what the threat

449
00:27:16,751 --> 00:27:19,999
is and we are trying to communicate that.

450
00:27:19,999 --> 00:27:21,999
If you don't want to hear that, if you want to be oblivious to it,

451
00:27:21,999 --> 00:27:23,959
that's your business.

452
00:27:23,959 --> 00:27:24,834
There are a lot of people putting their lives

453
00:27:24,834 --> 00:27:27,250
on the line to protect all of us in this room.

454
00:27:29,876 --> 00:27:31,083
(Applause).

455
00:27:33,709 --> 00:27:36,999
That's not what you are doing.

456
00:27:36,999 --> 00:27:37,999
(Applause).

457
00:27:37,999 --> 00:27:39,375
Thank you for being here.

458
00:27:39,375 --> 00:27:42,918
I think this is a question you don't need to answer, but who participated

459
00:27:42,918 --> 00:27:45,375
in creating the speech?

460
00:27:45,375 --> 00:27:46,667
I'm sorry?

461
00:27:46,667 --> 00:27:49,709
Who participated in creating the speech?

462
00:27:49,709 --> 00:27:50,709
What speech?

463
00:27:50,709 --> 00:27:52,167
Like the one you just gave.

464
00:27:52,167 --> 00:27:53,167
I did.

465
00:27:53,167 --> 00:27:54,167
Only you?

466
00:27:54,167 --> 00:27:55,167
Only me.

467
00:27:55,167 --> 00:27:56,167
Okay.

468
00:27:56,167 --> 00:27:57,167
Thank you.

469
00:27:57,501 --> 00:27:59,584
You mentioned Iran at the beginning of your speech

470
00:27:59,584 --> 00:28:02,999
and said they were months away from creating a nuclear weapon.

471
00:28:02,999 --> 00:28:04,626
Considering the fact we have heard that

472
00:28:04,626 --> 00:28:09,167
in the last 30 years, particularly the last 8 years why should we believe

473
00:28:09,167 --> 00:28:13,209
you now when you have been so wrong in the past?

474
00:28:13,501 --> 00:28:16,626
Let me ask you to do this.

475
00:28:18,751 --> 00:28:22,792
I know you search the internet.

476
00:28:22,792 --> 00:28:27,999
Go onto the board of governors' report, the Director General of the IAEA,

477
00:28:27,999 --> 00:28:34,209
every three months he does a report to the board of directors.

478
00:28:34,209 --> 00:28:37,834
Go to the May 22nd, 2013 and see what the IAEA,

479
00:28:37,834 --> 00:28:42,667
independent organization says about Iran's program,

480
00:28:42,667 --> 00:28:48,709
about the 17,000 subterfuges, the sophistication about the 180,

481
00:28:48,709 --> 00:28:54,918
now 190 kilograms of uranium being enriched to purity.

482
00:28:58,667 --> 00:29:05,501
Six tons, six tons of uranium enriched to 5% purity.

483
00:29:05,501 --> 00:29:07,626
We are talking about five to six weapons.

484
00:29:07,626 --> 00:29:10,667
Talk about what the IAE it's not what the U.S.

485
00:29:10,999 --> 00:29:14,125
government is saying, it's what the IAE is saying, read that report

486
00:29:14,125 --> 00:29:17,999
and the ones that preceded it and the one coming out in a few weeks

487
00:29:17,999 --> 00:29:20,709
and draw your own conclusions.

488
00:29:21,918 --> 00:29:23,626
We have all of these reports going back years

489
00:29:23,626 --> 00:29:24,999
and years.

490
00:29:27,999 --> 00:29:32,083
Every year there is a scary report about Iran developing nuclear weapons.

491
00:29:32,542 --> 00:29:36,375
We are not talking developing, we are saying they have

492
00:29:36,375 --> 00:29:43,083
a capability and if they make a decision, they could do that within months.

493
00:29:43,083 --> 00:29:46,999
Hopefully they don't make that decision because it will open up some suspect,

494
00:29:46,999 --> 00:29:49,334
I suspect as a person that that would open

495
00:29:49,334 --> 00:29:51,501
up the Middle East.

496
00:29:51,751 --> 00:29:54,999
I don't think countries are going to sit there when you look

497
00:29:54,999 --> 00:29:58,834
at the Sunni Shiite, when you look at Iran's support to Hezbollah,

498
00:29:58,834 --> 00:30:02,042
when you look at what's going on in Syria.

499
00:30:02,209 --> 00:30:07,999
That would be a concern if you are sitting in Israel.

500
00:30:08,417 --> 00:30:11,501
Iran with nuclear weapons is an existential threat.

501
00:30:12,083 --> 00:30:19,918
I'm sure Iran containing weapons is a more greater existential threat.

502
00:30:24,999 --> 00:30:29,167
Sir, just read the you are making conclusions.

503
00:30:29,999 --> 00:30:33,751
I'm making my own assessments, you make your own assessment.

504
00:30:33,999 --> 00:30:36,792
Have you read the board of directors' report?

505
00:30:36,792 --> 00:30:37,792
I have not.

506
00:30:37,792 --> 00:30:39,375
Have you read any of the report?

507
00:30:39,375 --> 00:30:41,542
As soon as even if he accepts it though, he is saying

508
00:30:41,542 --> 00:30:44,167
he trusts over states last.

509
00:30:44,167 --> 00:30:46,792
So even if he accepts that they are doing it.

510
00:30:46,792 --> 00:30:48,250
Accepts they are doing what?

511
00:30:48,501 --> 00:30:51,042
Accepts that Iran is making those.

512
00:30:51,042 --> 00:30:52,834
I'm not following your logic.

513
00:30:52,834 --> 00:30:53,999
I'm sorry.

514
00:30:53,999 --> 00:30:56,959
I give up.

515
00:30:56,999 --> 00:30:58,209
Okay.

516
00:30:58,834 --> 00:31:01,999
I think the way that you are approaching

517
00:31:01,999 --> 00:31:07,501
the cyber issue is wrong headed, and misses the point.

518
00:31:07,501 --> 00:31:10,417
So we don't need an international    I think I can tell you

519
00:31:10,417 --> 00:31:14,626
talk about protecting our nation's grid and so on.

520
00:31:14,626 --> 00:31:17,250
If our nation had a power grid that was robust,

521
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:22,125
you wouldn't need firewalls protecting other people or protecting us

522
00:31:22,125 --> 00:31:24,501
from other people.

523
00:31:24,501 --> 00:31:28,334
We need to make what we have secure, and then this talk about monitoring

524
00:31:28,334 --> 00:31:31,167
the world's cyber, which is pretty ridiculous

525
00:31:31,167 --> 00:31:33,959
because it can't be seen.

526
00:31:33,999 --> 00:31:37,999
I mean, the things that you are talking about might work when people have

527
00:31:37,999 --> 00:31:40,999
to haul weapons around the world, might work when

528
00:31:40,999 --> 00:31:44,792
they are actual problems like you could drop a bomb on this,

529
00:31:44,792 --> 00:31:48,083
but if the grid is robust, the grid will be robust even

530
00:31:48,083 --> 00:31:50,918
if people are poking at it.

531
00:31:50,918 --> 00:31:53,999
What we need to do to be secure is to be secure in and of ourselves

532
00:31:53,999 --> 00:31:57,417
and stop playing this game like we can control the world,

533
00:31:57,417 --> 00:32:02,083
like we can see cyber and it's some sort of weapon we can stop.

534
00:32:02,501 --> 00:32:03,834
It will never work.

535
00:32:04,125 --> 00:32:05,709
(Applause).

536
00:32:06,083 --> 00:32:09,167
Well, let me just say, if we could make our systems

537
00:32:09,167 --> 00:32:13,999
as robust as you just described, whether it's our corporations that are

538
00:32:13,999 --> 00:32:19,459
losing intellectual property, and we just saw that in South Korea.

539
00:32:19,584 --> 00:32:21,542
We saw it in the United States, in Saudi.

540
00:32:21,542 --> 00:32:26,125
If these companies can insure that their systems are secure so that these bad

541
00:32:26,125 --> 00:32:30,667
hackers can't get into them or individuals or governments can't do

542
00:32:30,667 --> 00:32:32,999
that, that is fine.

543
00:32:32,999 --> 00:32:36,626
If we could come up with the grids that are impenetrable,

544
00:32:36,626 --> 00:32:40,083
that's our challenge to do that.

545
00:32:40,083 --> 00:32:42,999
The fact of the matter is we see vulnerability.

546
00:32:42,999 --> 00:32:43,999
We, internationally, I'm not talking

547
00:32:43,999 --> 00:32:46,334
about any particular country.

548
00:32:46,334 --> 00:32:49,292
Saudi Arabia, South Korea is not the United States.

549
00:32:49,876 --> 00:32:52,834
These countries are being affected, and so forth.

550
00:32:52,834 --> 00:32:55,999
So if we can collaborate, that's what I'm talking about.

551
00:32:55,999 --> 00:32:57,417
That's what the UN is about.

552
00:32:57,417 --> 00:33:00,375
You can collaborate on offering people technologies that

553
00:33:00,375 --> 00:33:03,334
they can use to secure their own systems,

554
00:33:03,334 --> 00:33:08,125
but there is    Then we need to move forward on that.

555
00:33:08,125 --> 00:33:11,334
This is what I'm trying to say to you, the words that you are using to us,

556
00:33:11,334 --> 00:33:14,250
we recognize to be counterproductive.

557
00:33:14,250 --> 00:33:17,459
You want to put a firewall around this to help these people.

558
00:33:19,626 --> 00:33:23,999
There are things we could do to help these companies to be secure.

559
00:33:23,999 --> 00:33:25,501
That's your challenge.

560
00:33:25,501 --> 00:33:27,125
Now, you are interrupting me.

561
00:33:27,125 --> 00:33:29,999
I'm trying to say to you that the words you are using

562
00:33:29,999 --> 00:33:34,584
to us are ones that are guaranteed to make this conversation less

563
00:33:34,584 --> 00:33:39,626
effective, and we would be willing, probably, in a lot of ways to help,

564
00:33:39,626 --> 00:33:45,999
but the old world terms of firewalls, and monitoring, they just don't apply.

565
00:33:45,999 --> 00:33:51,250
If you want to know what would work, then ask us how you should be set up.

566
00:33:51,250 --> 00:33:54,209
Don't talk to us about working like the IAEA.

567
00:33:54,334 --> 00:33:55,999
Ask us how.

568
00:33:56,167 --> 00:33:59,501
Well, let me posit this to you, let me posit this to you.

569
00:33:59,626 --> 00:34:03,542
I'm giving you my experience working weapons of mass destruction.

570
00:34:04,834 --> 00:34:07,584
Obviously you are the expert on cyber technology,

571
00:34:07,584 --> 00:34:09,959
information technology.

572
00:34:09,999 --> 00:34:12,459
Move forward with what you just proposed.

573
00:34:12,876 --> 00:34:14,167
No, let me finish.

574
00:34:14,584 --> 00:34:16,626
Move forward with what you just proposed so that

575
00:34:16,626 --> 00:34:20,209
the South Koreas, the Georgias, the Saudi Arabias, the United States,

576
00:34:20,209 --> 00:34:24,501
our companies go out and work with these companies and do it.

577
00:34:24,501 --> 00:34:25,999
I know many of you are doing it.

578
00:34:25,999 --> 00:34:29,083
That's the challenge and that's the challenge I mentioned to you and

579
00:34:29,083 --> 00:34:31,999
all of us a few minutes ago.

580
00:34:32,125 --> 00:34:35,083
You, the experts, go out and do what you are talking about.

581
00:34:38,542 --> 00:34:41,999
I didn't want to offend you, but I don't use your name terminology

582
00:34:41,999 --> 00:34:44,459
because you are the expert in the area of cyber,

583
00:34:44,459 --> 00:34:46,709
information technology.

584
00:34:46,709 --> 00:34:47,792
I don't pretend to be.

585
00:34:47,792 --> 00:34:49,834
I'm using terminology I'm comfortable.

586
00:34:49,999 --> 00:34:55,626
If it's not applicable in your area, I think it's the intent, it's not the words.

587
00:34:55,626 --> 00:34:59,083
No, the intent    I say yes, you say no.

588
00:34:59,083 --> 00:35:00,083
We disagree.

589
00:35:00,083 --> 00:35:03,584
Maybe I could help because I see that your intent,

590
00:35:03,584 --> 00:35:09,501
I get that you want to do these things, but the things that you are saying are

591
00:35:09,501 --> 00:35:13,417
sort of incorrect for the area, and if you just want

592
00:35:13,417 --> 00:35:17,083
to say my intents are good, I mean it from this,

593
00:35:17,083 --> 00:35:20,999
I have got this experience, then, okay.

594
00:35:21,083 --> 00:35:24,083
But when you put it that way, it's not going to work as well.

595
00:35:25,417 --> 00:35:28,918
So you mentioned that we should use skills to participate more

596
00:35:28,918 --> 00:35:31,959
and use our knowledge to help educate our representatives,

597
00:35:31,959 --> 00:35:33,334
et cetera.

598
00:35:33,334 --> 00:35:33,999
I know I have done a lot of lobbying on things

599
00:35:33,999 --> 00:35:35,999
like SOPA and things like that.

600
00:35:36,501 --> 00:35:40,667
The corporate interests have largely captured our representatives.

601
00:35:40,834 --> 00:35:43,792
What do you feel about the role of Hactivism and using our role

602
00:35:43,792 --> 00:35:45,999
in a modern democracy?

603
00:35:50,792 --> 00:35:53,375
I'm not hearing the end of your sentence.

604
00:35:53,375 --> 00:35:56,999
How do you feel about the role of hactivism or using our roles

605
00:35:56,999 --> 00:36:00,709
to influence behaviors, et cetera, as opposed to working

606
00:36:00,709 --> 00:36:04,918
through the traditional channels of government?

607
00:36:05,459 --> 00:36:06,999
Many of you I'm sure are working

608
00:36:06,999 --> 00:36:09,083
with the private sector.

609
00:36:09,334 --> 00:36:12,501
Cyber is one of the major issues, because we are talking

610
00:36:12,501 --> 00:36:16,167
about intellectual properties and billions of dollars, the billions

611
00:36:16,167 --> 00:36:19,999
of dollars that are being stolen from the corporate sector, not only

612
00:36:19,999 --> 00:36:23,584
in the United States, obviously, but globally, internationally,

613
00:36:23,584 --> 00:36:25,876
so getting involved with these companies

614
00:36:25,876 --> 00:36:27,999
to protect that, yes.

615
00:36:28,999 --> 00:36:32,999
I don't feel like you really answered the question,

616
00:36:32,999 --> 00:36:37,999
but, are you familiar with a group called Anonymous?

617
00:36:37,999 --> 00:36:39,501
I'm sorry?

618
00:36:43,250 --> 00:36:47,542
Basically my question comes down to it seems like working

619
00:36:47,542 --> 00:36:51,417
through the corporate structure, we are only reinforcing

620
00:36:51,417 --> 00:36:55,999
a structure that's working against    I heard you said anonymous

621
00:36:55,999 --> 00:36:58,626
and I get your question.

622
00:36:59,876 --> 00:37:02,959
I'm talking about intellectual property.

623
00:37:03,125 --> 00:37:04,999
I'm talking about the many companies I think some

624
00:37:04,999 --> 00:37:06,792
of you are involved with that are losing

625
00:37:06,792 --> 00:37:08,751
intellectual property.

626
00:37:08,751 --> 00:37:12,834
But not only the United States globally, we are talking billions of dollars.

627
00:37:12,999 --> 00:37:14,792
We are talking about that.

628
00:37:14,792 --> 00:37:15,999
That's one aspect to it.

629
00:37:15,999 --> 00:37:18,834
The other aspects you mentioned anonymous there.

630
00:37:18,999 --> 00:37:21,834
Go forward, do what you have to do.

631
00:37:21,834 --> 00:37:23,999
I'm talking about intellectual property.

632
00:37:23,999 --> 00:37:26,167
I'm talking about critical infrastructure.

633
00:37:26,167 --> 00:37:27,167
That's my focus.

634
00:37:27,167 --> 00:37:28,709
Your focuses are different.

635
00:37:28,709 --> 00:37:29,709
That's fine.

636
00:37:31,834 --> 00:37:37,292
In your opinion, how has the NPT, non proliferation regime then impacted,

637
00:37:37,292 --> 00:37:41,459
I guess how much by regularizing civil nuclear relations

638
00:37:41,459 --> 00:37:43,209
with India?

639
00:37:43,792 --> 00:37:47,999
Well, the NPT, we would like countries to be part of the NPT

640
00:37:47,999 --> 00:37:52,876
and there are four countries not members of the NPT.

641
00:37:52,876 --> 00:37:53,876
Yes.

642
00:37:53,876 --> 00:37:55,417
And that's unfortunate.

643
00:37:55,417 --> 00:37:56,999
We would like to see all countries become members

644
00:37:56,999 --> 00:37:59,876
because of safeguards and protocols.

645
00:38:00,501 --> 00:38:03,667
So non member in the NPT because it affected the IEA and

646
00:38:03,667 --> 00:38:07,209
the monitoring aspects of negative development.

647
00:38:07,209 --> 00:38:09,542
We would like countries to be part of the NPT.

648
00:38:09,542 --> 00:38:13,292
So my question, is the act of the United States regularizing our

649
00:38:13,292 --> 00:38:17,542
relationship with India's civil nuclear regime actually

650
00:38:17,542 --> 00:38:20,334
working against the NPT?

651
00:38:20,834 --> 00:38:24,501
That's a bifurcated issue because the U.S.

652
00:38:24,501 --> 00:38:26,459
has decided there is a civilian program and

653
00:38:26,459 --> 00:38:29,417
a military program in India.

654
00:38:29,417 --> 00:38:31,876
And a decision was made by previous administration to deal

655
00:38:31,876 --> 00:38:34,626
with India in a bifurcated way.

656
00:38:34,626 --> 00:38:35,626
Okay.

657
00:38:35,626 --> 00:38:38,083
I was just, it seems like it's giving up one of the big carrots that

658
00:38:38,083 --> 00:38:39,709
the NPT has.

659
00:38:39,709 --> 00:38:43,209
It's countries like you just cited, and that's where we are with that,

660
00:38:43,209 --> 00:38:47,459
but we see India is a democracy, a country using civil nuclear programs

661
00:38:47,459 --> 00:38:51,250
in a meaningful way, and that's the bifurcation.

662
00:38:55,959 --> 00:38:59,334
Two things, the first one a shout out to Def Con

663
00:38:59,334 --> 00:39:02,250
for closed captioning there.

664
00:39:02,250 --> 00:39:03,834
I think that's fucking cool!

665
00:39:04,167 --> 00:39:06,292
So, yea Def Con!

666
00:39:08,709 --> 00:39:11,709
And then the second thing is, I guess I'm

667
00:39:11,709 --> 00:39:16,918
a little perplexed I don't know why I'm shaking, because it seems that

668
00:39:16,918 --> 00:39:20,999
in terms of resources that the government spends in terms

669
00:39:20,999 --> 00:39:25,292
of dealing with cyber warfare, it's always through the lens

670
00:39:25,292 --> 00:39:28,999
of state agents, that's the threat.

671
00:39:28,999 --> 00:39:32,375
And it seems to me that there is billions lost every day

672
00:39:32,375 --> 00:39:35,834
by people who are victims of cybercrime and that

673
00:39:35,834 --> 00:39:40,834
the NSA's mandate, for instance, doesn't at all deal with that, and that

674
00:39:40,834 --> 00:39:45,959
the government resources don't at all seem to address this.

675
00:39:45,959 --> 00:39:48,834
Yet to me, and I may be wrong, but it seems to me that that

676
00:39:48,834 --> 00:39:53,959
is proportionately in terms of its economic impact on the U.S.

677
00:39:53,959 --> 00:39:57,709
and other western nations the much bigger threat.

678
00:39:57,999 --> 00:39:59,375
Thanks.

679
00:39:59,375 --> 00:40:01,959
Well, those are fair comments and we need to, you need

680
00:40:01,959 --> 00:40:05,999
to get involved and all of us need to get involved.

681
00:40:05,999 --> 00:40:07,626
It's a multidimensional threat.

682
00:40:07,626 --> 00:40:08,999
I think you just cited that.

683
00:40:11,999 --> 00:40:15,000
Ambassador, I'm wondering what do you think

684
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:19,999
the prospects are for restarting the six party talks around North Korea,

685
00:40:19,999 --> 00:40:24,125
given that it seems most of the major players continue to fail

686
00:40:24,125 --> 00:40:29,584
to recognize the importance of signing a permanent peace treaty?

687
00:40:29,999 --> 00:40:31,999
JOSEPH DETRANI: I think it's important to get back

688
00:40:31,999 --> 00:40:34,334
to negotiations with North Korea.

689
00:40:34,626 --> 00:40:38,667
I think North Korea has indicated with the new government that

690
00:40:38,667 --> 00:40:43,792
they are prepared to address the denuclearization issue.

691
00:40:43,999 --> 00:40:47,999
It's not a question of non proliferation, it's a question of denuclearization.

692
00:40:47,999 --> 00:40:51,042
They are prepared to look at and consider the 1st of September,

693
00:40:51,042 --> 00:40:54,999
2005 joint statement that spoke to comprehensive denuclearization

694
00:40:54,999 --> 00:40:56,999
in exchange for security assurances

695
00:40:56,999 --> 00:40:59,334
and economic assistance.

696
00:41:01,584 --> 00:41:03,751
So I think there is a positive.

697
00:41:03,999 --> 00:41:06,083
The concern of immediately coming back

698
00:41:06,083 --> 00:41:10,542
to the six party talks is how sincere, how sincere is North Korea

699
00:41:10,542 --> 00:41:12,918
with this approach?

700
00:41:12,918 --> 00:41:16,626
I think if North Korea continues to be sincere as they are saying

701
00:41:16,626 --> 00:41:21,417
they are, and they are saying this to China and publicly now, and,

702
00:41:21,417 --> 00:41:25,334
you know, cease and desist with more threats, attempts

703
00:41:25,334 --> 00:41:29,918
to intimidate and missile launches, I think the sense is that

704
00:41:29,918 --> 00:41:33,375
the negotiations will resume, and because we need

705
00:41:33,375 --> 00:41:38,584
to be successful with North Korea, we need to be very, very successful,

706
00:41:38,584 --> 00:41:41,918
I think we can accomplish that.

707
00:41:41,918 --> 00:41:43,501
I absolutely agreed with that.

708
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:46,375
That's why I asked about the peace treaty in particular.

709
00:41:46,375 --> 00:41:48,375
Maybe it's time for a fresh approach or different set of tries

710
00:41:48,375 --> 00:41:51,626
because it seems like whatever has been tried

711
00:41:51,626 --> 00:41:53,999
before hasn't worked.

712
00:41:53,999 --> 00:41:56,999
JOSEPH DETRANI: Well, this is that's a very fair point.

713
00:41:57,292 --> 00:42:00,209
This is exactly no one wants to go back to talks for the sake

714
00:42:00,209 --> 00:42:02,959
of talks because as we have been talking North

715
00:42:02,959 --> 00:42:06,334
Korea has gone from 6 to 12 nuclear weapons.

716
00:42:06,334 --> 00:42:07,834
We believe they have uranium enrichment

717
00:42:07,834 --> 00:42:09,999
programs fabricating.

718
00:42:09,999 --> 00:42:14,999
We see missile launches and a satellite, the trajectory has gone the other way.

719
00:42:14,999 --> 00:42:16,751
So what we want is not talks for the sake of talks,

720
00:42:16,751 --> 00:42:20,709
but implementation of a program that will lead to success.

721
00:42:20,834 --> 00:42:23,999
And my personal view is I think with the assistance, certainly

722
00:42:23,999 --> 00:42:27,501
the pitch parties coming together, the five countries with North Korea

723
00:42:27,501 --> 00:42:30,417
and China being very, very much involved with North Korea,

724
00:42:30,417 --> 00:42:32,999
I think we will see progress.

725
00:42:36,167 --> 00:42:38,083
Hi.

726
00:42:38,083 --> 00:42:41,999
You compared cyber to chemical weapons and World War I.

727
00:42:41,999 --> 00:42:45,999
What do you see as the parallels there?

728
00:42:45,999 --> 00:42:48,250
JOSEPH DETRANI: No, I wasn't comparing.

729
00:42:48,250 --> 00:42:51,626
What I'm saying is when we saw the devastation of biological weapons,

730
00:42:51,626 --> 00:42:54,584
chemical weapons, the international community rose

731
00:42:54,584 --> 00:42:58,959
up and said, my God, we have to sort of understand this and work together

732
00:42:58,959 --> 00:43:02,459
a community, not countries, but as an international community

733
00:43:02,459 --> 00:43:04,999
globally working together.

734
00:43:04,999 --> 00:43:07,375
And that's why we have these international protocols on the bylaws

735
00:43:07,375 --> 00:43:09,167
of weapons convention, the chemical and

736
00:43:09,167 --> 00:43:11,542
the same thing with nuclear.

737
00:43:11,542 --> 00:43:14,209
This is not a country specific issue.

738
00:43:14,209 --> 00:43:16,083
It's a global international issue.

739
00:43:16,250 --> 00:43:19,334
And I think we all admit, you know, you are the experts, again, cyber

740
00:43:19,334 --> 00:43:21,876
is not a country specific issue.

741
00:43:21,876 --> 00:43:22,918
It's a global issue.

742
00:43:22,918 --> 00:43:26,459
I don't want to speak for people here, but I suspect

743
00:43:26,459 --> 00:43:30,999
the response would be that there is simply too many non state actors

744
00:43:30,999 --> 00:43:35,501
for a massive    JOSEPH DETRANI: That's a fair point.

745
00:43:35,501 --> 00:43:37,167
That's why it's a difficult issue.

746
00:43:37,167 --> 00:43:38,417
It's a difficult issue.

747
00:43:38,417 --> 00:43:39,417
It's a challenge.

748
00:43:39,417 --> 00:43:40,999
Okay.

749
00:43:40,999 --> 00:43:41,999
Peace.

750
00:43:45,375 --> 00:43:50,292
JOSEPH DETRANI: Okay, any other positive comments?

751
00:43:51,792 --> 00:43:54,209
(Laughter) Any other good questions?

752
00:43:54,667 --> 00:43:57,083
Actually, no, we need to get the next speaker.

753
00:43:57,083 --> 00:43:59,999
JOSEPH DETRANI: Good luck, and, look, use that energy,

754
00:43:59,999 --> 00:44:02,999
use that expertise and help this government work

755
00:44:02,999 --> 00:44:07,626
with the international community so that we do counter the potential threat,

756
00:44:07,626 --> 00:44:12,167
and use it in a peaceful meaningful way which it is, so you are the experts,

757
00:44:12,167 --> 00:44:14,959
so good luck to all of you.
