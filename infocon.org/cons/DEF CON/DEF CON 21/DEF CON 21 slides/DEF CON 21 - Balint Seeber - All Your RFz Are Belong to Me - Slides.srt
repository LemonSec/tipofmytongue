1
00:00:00,042 --> 00:00:02,792
So anyway, here you go.

2
00:00:02,792 --> 00:00:04,083
Here's your speaker, enjoy.

3
00:00:04,083 --> 00:00:06,459
(Applause)    BALINT SEEBER: Good morning.

4
00:00:11,417 --> 00:00:14,459
Thank you all very much for coming out on what I understand

5
00:00:14,459 --> 00:00:16,959
is an early Defcon morning.

6
00:00:17,501 --> 00:00:20,375
I would very much like to show you my slides,

7
00:00:20,375 --> 00:00:25,542
but as you can see there might be a little of a technical glitch.

8
00:00:25,584 --> 00:00:28,918
And I would really honestly, love to get started, but it's kind of crucial

9
00:00:28,918 --> 00:00:30,876
to have the slides.

10
00:00:30,876 --> 00:00:35,209
So, I thought maybe we could try the reverse and do a bit of Q&A.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,667
(Laughter)    BALINT SEEBER: How many people are into radio?

12
00:00:44,999 --> 00:00:46,626
All right, cool.

13
00:00:46,626 --> 00:00:51,667
How many people have-- who knows what a software defined radio is?

14
00:00:51,999 --> 00:00:53,459
Okay.

15
00:00:53,459 --> 00:00:56,417
And how many people have actually played around with one?

16
00:00:56,626 --> 00:00:58,999
How many people own one?

17
00:00:59,542 --> 00:01:03,292
How many people have USRB?

18
00:01:04,334 --> 00:01:07,751
How many people have a Realtek T.V.

19
00:01:07,751 --> 00:01:08,751
dongle?

20
00:01:09,334 --> 00:01:11,792
And who knows GNU radio?

21
00:01:12,375 --> 00:01:13,834
Excellent.

22
00:01:14,167 --> 00:01:16,209
That's very encouraging.

23
00:01:16,751 --> 00:01:18,751
Applause already.

24
00:01:18,751 --> 00:01:28,918
(Applause)       BALINT SEEBER: If I-- if you pardon the debugging

25
00:01:28,918 --> 00:01:32,459
across the room.

26
00:01:32,459 --> 00:01:35,999
Do you know where you are actually receiving the signal from my laptop?

27
00:01:46,876 --> 00:01:49,542
(Off microphone)    BALINT SEEBER: Would it be possible

28
00:01:49,542 --> 00:01:52,959
to temporarily connect one projector or something?

29
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:55,375
It's actually the multiplexer back there.

30
00:01:55,375 --> 00:01:56,959
BALINT SEEBER: All right.

31
00:01:56,959 --> 00:01:58,375
Yeah, it's- no keep on going.

32
00:01:58,375 --> 00:02:01,209
By the way, the Q&A.

33
00:02:01,209 --> 00:02:02,999
Time has passed.

34
00:02:02,999 --> 00:02:05,334
We used to have a Q&A where we'd get together go

35
00:02:05,334 --> 00:02:07,709
to a room to a Q&A.

36
00:02:07,709 --> 00:02:09,959
There's one big mess of Q&A room back there.

37
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:12,834
And if this gentleman wants to take beers and shots

38
00:02:12,834 --> 00:02:16,459
and whatever and talk to him at the bar.

39
00:02:16,459 --> 00:02:17,501
That's a Q&A area.

40
00:02:17,501 --> 00:02:19,626
So, this year the Q&A area is pretty much going to be handled

41
00:02:19,626 --> 00:02:23,626
out in the hallway or wherever else that you deem necessary.

42
00:02:23,626 --> 00:02:27,999
So, at the end of the talk I'll (Off microphone)

43
00:02:27,999 --> 00:02:32,125
BALINT SEEBER: I'm okay with that.

44
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:40,083
(Laughter)    So, why don't you get this guy

45
00:02:40,083 --> 00:02:41,876
up and running.

46
00:02:41,876 --> 00:02:43,375
BALINT SEEBER: Well, I guess I should also add that my name

47
00:02:43,375 --> 00:02:45,083
is Balint Seeber.

48
00:02:45,751 --> 00:02:47,876
As you might gather, I'm not originally

49
00:02:47,876 --> 00:02:50,083
from around these parts.

50
00:02:50,083 --> 00:02:53,417
I moved to the states about middle of last year.

51
00:02:53,501 --> 00:02:55,999
I had been sort of mucking around with software defined radio

52
00:02:55,999 --> 00:02:57,667
in my own time.

53
00:02:57,667 --> 00:02:59,792
I had been working on a Ph.D., but unfortunately, for that,

54
00:02:59,792 --> 00:03:02,417
through a friend I discovered what software radio was

55
00:03:02,417 --> 00:03:04,751
about and I let the Ph.D.

56
00:03:04,751 --> 00:03:10,876
slide (Applause.) I would like to show you the things I did

57
00:03:10,876 --> 00:03:13,876
during that time.

58
00:03:13,999 --> 00:03:15,751
Since then go?

59
00:03:15,792 --> 00:03:20,626
Keep on talking.

60
00:03:20,626 --> 00:03:23,501
BALINT SEEBER: I joined EDIS Research so I'm

61
00:03:23,501 --> 00:03:28,542
an applications engineer this, and I guess one bonus is I get

62
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:32,417
to play around with cool, new toys.

63
00:03:32,834 --> 00:03:36,459
One of which I would like to sort of show you today.

64
00:03:36,999 --> 00:03:41,709
Did you want to check the    Change it down.

65
00:03:46,501 --> 00:03:47,999
Okay, 1024.

66
00:03:47,999 --> 00:03:53,209
BALINT SEEBER: I have a laptop, did you want me to try that one?

67
00:03:53,999 --> 00:03:58,417
You can, won't hurt.

68
00:03:58,417 --> 00:03:59,667
BALINT SEEBER: Okay.

69
00:04:02,999 --> 00:04:05,584
(Laughter.) Anymore questions?

70
00:04:05,792 --> 00:04:09,125
(Laughter.)    AUDIENCE MEMBER: What's your drink of choice?

71
00:04:09,125 --> 00:04:13,751
BALINT SEEBER: I'm actually not much of a drinker, you know?

72
00:04:16,501 --> 00:04:18,792
AUDIENCE MEMBER: You will be after this?

73
00:04:18,792 --> 00:04:21,542
BALINT SEEBER: I was thinking that might be the case.

74
00:04:21,626 --> 00:04:25,250
I guess I don't know, do any of you recognize this

75
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:27,834
or anything like it?

76
00:04:28,125 --> 00:04:32,250
It's a fast track tag that you normally affix to your car,

77
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:36,626
gets scanned when you go through the toll booths, this

78
00:04:36,626 --> 00:04:42,792
is an antenna that you can read these with and I figured I can't remember how

79
00:04:42,792 --> 00:04:46,459
I came across it but I came across I don't know

80
00:04:46,459 --> 00:04:50,334
if you seen there was a Black Hat talk that dealt

81
00:04:50,334 --> 00:04:54,417
with opening these up and reversing and decompiling

82
00:04:54,417 --> 00:04:58,999
the firm wear and that was nice and you go into the chip

83
00:04:58,999 --> 00:05:01,999
and extract the software.

84
00:05:02,125 --> 00:05:08,209
But I figured I would implement the radio side of it, so I just did it

85
00:05:08,209 --> 00:05:11,792
over two nights last week.

86
00:05:12,751 --> 00:05:16,999
Simply it will read the ID as it's not an encrypted protocol out of one

87
00:05:16,999 --> 00:05:21,751
of these tags, you hold it up there and it will read it out.

88
00:05:22,083 --> 00:05:24,792
I would have nice images to demonstrate that later

89
00:05:24,792 --> 00:05:28,709
on but I guess I can hand wave in the meantime!

90
00:05:29,542 --> 00:05:34,250
I'm kinda giving you the summary of the entire thing.

91
00:05:36,542 --> 00:05:38,626
How are we doing back there?

92
00:05:40,626 --> 00:05:44,667
(Laughter.) This is not quite the start that I was expecting.

93
00:05:46,999 --> 00:05:50,459
Is anybody doing any cool projects in SDR at the moment?

94
00:05:50,459 --> 00:05:51,626
I had a question there?

95
00:05:51,626 --> 00:05:54,167
AUDIENCE MEMBER: You mentioned

96
00:05:54,167 --> 00:05:58,209
the    BALINT SEEBER: Yes, I do.

97
00:05:58,209 --> 00:05:59,209
Let me grab one.

98
00:05:59,209 --> 00:06:00,999
(Applause.) I carry one around!

99
00:06:02,999 --> 00:06:04,751
Thank you!

100
00:06:07,125 --> 00:06:08,792
All right, then.

101
00:06:10,918 --> 00:06:13,959
So thanks for coming!

102
00:06:13,959 --> 00:06:16,959
Just wanted to tell you a little bit about me, otherwise obsessed

103
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:20,501
with electronics and wireless, I think this is in the kindergarten

104
00:06:20,501 --> 00:06:23,501
or first grade, I don't know what the hell I was making

105
00:06:23,501 --> 00:06:26,751
but it was a contained part of an old tape deck and it had

106
00:06:26,751 --> 00:06:30,751
a blinking light with a VU meter, that was cool for me.

107
00:06:34,167 --> 00:06:38,083
Contraptions, trying to build it, this is on top of a park back in Sidney

108
00:06:38,083 --> 00:06:40,209
with a friend of mine.

109
00:06:40,209 --> 00:06:41,999
We put together a long wire antenna

110
00:06:41,999 --> 00:06:47,417
because we were trying to pick up the cherry ripe numbers station that

111
00:06:47,417 --> 00:06:52,334
was broadcasting out of Guam run by MI6, I believe, and we tried

112
00:06:52,334 --> 00:06:56,542
a couple of successive weekends and then realized that

113
00:06:56,542 --> 00:07:02,999
the station has been shutdown (Laughter.) It was fun to get the images.

114
00:07:08,584 --> 00:07:13,375
My journey into software radio shaped the talk.

115
00:07:13,751 --> 00:07:15,709
How I originally got into decoding systems

116
00:07:15,709 --> 00:07:19,751
with hospital pager systems, one of my favorites, tracking airplanes

117
00:07:19,751 --> 00:07:22,542
and looking at how you can decode something that

118
00:07:22,542 --> 00:07:25,083
you know nothing about, in this case coming

119
00:07:25,083 --> 00:07:29,999
down from satellites with a little bit of direction and fast track.

120
00:07:31,999 --> 00:07:36,083
Just to do a recap for those of you that aren't that experienced,

121
00:07:36,083 --> 00:07:39,709
the idea behind radio is that you have a carrier wave,

122
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:43,999
a single frequency and if you were to view it like this on a graph

123
00:07:43,999 --> 00:07:48,417
with time going from left to right, you would see your sign wave and

124
00:07:48,417 --> 00:07:52,959
the amplitude on a wire access and the idea is you have information,

125
00:07:52,959 --> 00:07:57,459
whether it be voice, digital bits can you hear me okay?

126
00:07:57,459 --> 00:07:58,709
Is this a good distance?

127
00:07:59,959 --> 00:08:02,167
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Yes!

128
00:08:02,709 --> 00:08:05,083
BALINT SEEBER: It goes into a modulator and you mix that

129
00:08:05,083 --> 00:08:08,417
with the carrier which puts it up to the frequency that you want

130
00:08:08,417 --> 00:08:10,584
to from time to time it at, so if you want

131
00:08:10,584 --> 00:08:13,709
to transmit FM radio then you would dial that in on the radio

132
00:08:13,709 --> 00:08:16,292
at the radio station, put in your music and outcomes

133
00:08:16,292 --> 00:08:18,834
the music on that frequency.

134
00:08:18,834 --> 00:08:22,918
So the simple modulation is on and off keying, where you turn on and

135
00:08:22,918 --> 00:08:26,334
off the carrier wave, and the simplest form of this

136
00:08:26,334 --> 00:08:30,542
is Morse Code can you tell me what that means?

137
00:08:33,417 --> 00:08:37,999
AUDIENCE MEMBER: DEF CON.

138
00:08:37,999 --> 00:08:39,918
BALINT SEEBER: DEF CON, correct!

139
00:08:39,999 --> 00:08:42,876
Which then it goes to more complicated stuff, RFD M

140
00:08:42,876 --> 00:08:48,167
and it's used in a whole host of those we use pretty much every day.

141
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:54,334
So you have your carrier at the top, the signal just

142
00:08:54,334 --> 00:08:58,999
below it and depending on the modulation you use you either

143
00:08:58,999 --> 00:09:03,751
get a wave you can see how the carrier's amplitude is meshed

144
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:08,501
with that of the signal or the frequency, much later version,

145
00:09:08,501 --> 00:09:11,667
the carrier maintains the same amplitude

146
00:09:11,667 --> 00:09:16,999
but the frequency changes with the change in the signal.

147
00:09:16,999 --> 00:09:23,292
So that's a basic difference in simple modulation games.

148
00:09:24,334 --> 00:09:29,083
Here is an example of a spectrum, this is a recording that I made

149
00:09:29,083 --> 00:09:33,501
of an automated broadcast from an airport regarding the state

150
00:09:33,501 --> 00:09:35,626
of the runways.

151
00:09:36,542 --> 00:09:38,209
I don't have any audio.

152
00:09:39,667 --> 00:09:42,417
Can I have the laptop audio pack?

153
00:09:44,209 --> 00:09:48,334
(Away from mic.)    BALINT SEEBER:

154
00:09:48,334 --> 00:09:50,501
Thank you.

155
00:09:51,999 --> 00:09:54,999
So this is amplitude modulated, you have a carrier in the middle and

156
00:09:54,999 --> 00:09:57,584
on the side you have identical side backs that contain this

157
00:09:57,584 --> 00:09:59,334
voice information.

158
00:10:02,167 --> 00:10:05,751
So the modulation will define what it will look

159
00:10:05,751 --> 00:10:08,709
like on that spectrum so you are looking

160
00:10:08,709 --> 00:10:13,584
at IM signals so that's symmetric with the carrier and FM you have

161
00:10:13,584 --> 00:10:17,876
the notion of the carrier but because it's been modulated

162
00:10:17,876 --> 00:10:20,792
and the frequency is moving around based

163
00:10:20,792 --> 00:10:24,918
upon the signal it looks different and finally you have

164
00:10:24,918 --> 00:10:29,209
a digital modulation scheme, C4 FM    AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Away

165
00:10:29,209 --> 00:10:32,876
from mic.)    BALINT SEEBER: Yeah.

166
00:10:32,999 --> 00:10:34,542
Of course that's not legal!

167
00:10:35,918 --> 00:10:39,083
(Laughter.) I'll come back to more of that kind of thing later!

168
00:10:39,667 --> 00:10:43,125
Does anyone know about P25?

169
00:10:45,292 --> 00:10:48,167
It's a digital voice standard used by first responders

170
00:10:48,167 --> 00:10:50,999
all around the world here in America and in Australia

171
00:10:50,999 --> 00:10:53,375
and other various places.

172
00:10:53,375 --> 00:10:58,999
AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Away from mic.)    BALINT SEEBER:

173
00:10:58,999 --> 00:11:01,626
It's maximum.

174
00:11:01,626 --> 00:11:03,999
So because it's digital modulation this is sort of a variant

175
00:11:03,999 --> 00:11:06,999
but it contains four states and because this is moving

176
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:11,501
through quickly you get a different look to it on the spectrum.

177
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:16,999
What I'm trying to emphasize to you is that originally there is sort

178
00:11:16,999 --> 00:11:19,167
of hardware and the simple hardware

179
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:22,125
like crystal sets that were used and it was made

180
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:25,083
up with very simple components.

181
00:11:25,083 --> 00:11:28,584
The point was that they're all sort of fixed, a fixed personality.

182
00:11:28,584 --> 00:11:31,959
Nowadays they're more complicated with microchips and these other

183
00:11:31,959 --> 00:11:35,542
equipment, they're also fixed personality.

184
00:11:35,542 --> 00:11:38,751
So it's like a black box, you can't get in there and change it's not

185
00:11:38,751 --> 00:11:40,584
recon figurable.

186
00:11:40,999 --> 00:11:43,751
Here we have a satellite modem and keep this picture in mind

187
00:11:43,751 --> 00:11:46,417
because I will come back to that.

188
00:11:48,167 --> 00:11:50,083
The journey begins.

189
00:11:50,334 --> 00:11:56,417
I had this set up on my balcony back in Sidney and I heard

190
00:11:56,417 --> 00:12:01,999
a mysterious signal which will not play now.

191
00:12:10,375 --> 00:12:12,209
I'll do it manually.

192
00:12:12,209 --> 00:12:14,167
(Tone) Anybody recognize what that is?

193
00:12:16,125 --> 00:12:19,667
(Laughter.) At the time I wasn't sure what it was

194
00:12:19,667 --> 00:12:22,999
and I had tried to demode it with free software

195
00:12:22,999 --> 00:12:26,999
out there available but none of it worked.

196
00:12:27,083 --> 00:12:29,918
There we go!

197
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:32,667
(Laughter.) And this was my set up at the time,

198
00:12:32,667 --> 00:12:36,209
I inherited these radios from my grandfather, a scanner

199
00:12:36,209 --> 00:12:40,999
and other receivers and I interfaced it with that board there to any 286

200
00:12:40,999 --> 00:12:45,999
and had it running and would stream it downstairs and this was my simple set

201
00:12:45,999 --> 00:12:49,083
up to control the radio remotely.

202
00:12:49,083 --> 00:12:51,209
I thought I would try looking at the signal and once again we have

203
00:12:51,209 --> 00:12:53,375
the signal in the time domain and if you look

204
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:57,834
in the frequency domain you can see the two distinct levels coming out.

205
00:12:58,083 --> 00:13:01,999
This introduces the idea just like in data transfer that you have

206
00:13:01,999 --> 00:13:04,751
the preamble and the payload so you can see

207
00:13:04,751 --> 00:13:08,083
the preamble is important because it establishes for data

208
00:13:08,083 --> 00:13:10,999
the transmission, so that the receiver can lock

209
00:13:10,999 --> 00:13:15,542
on to it so it's a repeating pattern of one's and zero's and then you have

210
00:13:15,542 --> 00:13:17,999
the payload after that.

211
00:13:17,999 --> 00:13:21,876
Because it's two level SFK you can draw the line through the middle

212
00:13:21,876 --> 00:13:26,626
and slash it, anybody above will be 1, anything below, 0, so you have 1's

213
00:13:26,626 --> 00:13:29,167
and 0's, great, now what?

214
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:35,751
The idea is to turn it into information.

215
00:13:35,999 --> 00:13:39,999
This took on and off five years for me to actually figure out and

216
00:13:39,999 --> 00:13:42,876
in the process I ended up writing this bit

217
00:13:42,876 --> 00:13:46,999
of software that would take in this raw data and you could play

218
00:13:46,999 --> 00:13:51,334
around with ways of lining, coding, and so forth.

219
00:13:51,459 --> 00:13:54,167
I look at it every so often and come back

220
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:58,999
to it and it just happened that I was reading Wikipedia and there was

221
00:13:58,999 --> 00:14:03,999
an article in there that mentioned these specific sync words and I thought,

222
00:14:03,999 --> 00:14:07,083
hang on, I've seen them before and you can see

223
00:14:07,083 --> 00:14:11,083
in the window they match up and it turned out to be pot sag

224
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:14,751
but it was weird because what I had tried previously

225
00:14:14,751 --> 00:14:18,584
hadn't decoded, so this was an example of object security

226
00:14:18,584 --> 00:14:21,999
because I changed the implementation but it turned

227
00:14:21,999 --> 00:14:26,999
out to be the pages for the hospital network back in Sidney.

228
00:14:27,999 --> 00:14:30,667
We confirmed this I have a friend that works

229
00:14:30,667 --> 00:14:34,459
in the hospitals there and he called his friend and said can you

230
00:14:34,459 --> 00:14:37,542
send a page out and you can see what that test page

231
00:14:37,542 --> 00:14:40,501
is there, the one that's legible.

232
00:14:42,459 --> 00:14:45,417
Bringing it up on this map that I created,

233
00:14:45,417 --> 00:14:48,999
it was actually part of the hospital.

234
00:14:48,999 --> 00:14:51,083
You can see we identified the frequency.

235
00:14:51,626 --> 00:14:55,334
Once you have a look at where that site radiowise is linked to,

236
00:14:55,334 --> 00:15:00,792
you can see it's connected to all the other hospital in the area.

237
00:15:00,999 --> 00:15:06,459
So I let my decoder run for a little while and it turned

238
00:15:06,459 --> 00:15:12,083
out to be some seriously sensitive information.

239
00:15:14,167 --> 00:15:20,250
(Laughter.) And then finally (Laughter.) (Applause.) That was for one

240
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:24,125
of the secure systems, I believe.

241
00:15:25,209 --> 00:15:28,834
A side note, I just showed you that map.

242
00:15:28,834 --> 00:15:31,250
This is a more indirect call to the FCC to be open

243
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:34,999
about the data that they supposedly don't update their web

244
00:15:34,999 --> 00:15:38,626
site but the Australian government has been good and strict

245
00:15:38,626 --> 00:15:42,417
about maintaining all this data in one place.

246
00:15:42,417 --> 00:15:44,375
So my mash up also has these map overlays

247
00:15:44,375 --> 00:15:49,083
and this is a visualization of every registered radio transmitter

248
00:15:49,083 --> 00:15:53,501
in Australia and the links between them so you can see where

249
00:15:53,501 --> 00:15:57,375
the population concentrations are because that's where

250
00:15:57,375 --> 00:15:59,959
the radio sites are.

251
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:03,334
And also I derived radiation information so these are mobile cell towers

252
00:16:03,334 --> 00:16:07,959
in my neighborhood and if you look at various cell towers there you have

253
00:16:07,959 --> 00:16:11,626
these sharp lines coming out and they're the microwave point

254
00:16:11,626 --> 00:16:14,792
to point links between the towers.

255
00:16:15,083 --> 00:16:18,542
AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Away from mic.)    BALINT SEEBER: The

256
00:16:18,542 --> 00:16:24,250
government's database that I sort of imported contains the information.

257
00:16:26,918 --> 00:16:31,250
It's quite rough but it looks pretty, I guess.

258
00:16:31,959 --> 00:16:35,918
Somebody posted it at one stage and it was interesting

259
00:16:35,918 --> 00:16:40,626
to track what sites were popular, not sure that you can read that

260
00:16:40,626 --> 00:16:45,751
but they're all the echelon sites in Australia, so a station at Gerald

261
00:16:45,751 --> 00:16:50,999
to know and they're all covered with the radars, that's Pine Gap, there

262
00:16:50,999 --> 00:16:56,709
is a bit of joint U.S./Australian action going on there, I think.

263
00:16:58,709 --> 00:17:03,250
The first day I launched the sight I had visits from the U.S.

264
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:05,667
Department of Justice, federal parliament and my state's

265
00:17:05,667 --> 00:17:08,334
Attorney General's department.

266
00:17:08,334 --> 00:17:11,083
I have no idea how they happened upon it so quickly

267
00:17:11,083 --> 00:17:14,584
but (Laughter.) People trying to get in and hack

268
00:17:14,584 --> 00:17:18,876
the sight and scrape everything out and it's mostly coming

269
00:17:18,876 --> 00:17:24,167
from a couple of IPs in Bolivia so I band the entire country!

270
00:17:26,125 --> 00:17:29,334
(Laughter.) That was my journey to decoding things.

271
00:17:29,959 --> 00:17:31,999
Let's move on to aviation now.

272
00:17:31,999 --> 00:17:36,959
I have in the past liked to take a GPS receiver with me and stick it

273
00:17:36,959 --> 00:17:40,667
to the window and what is the politically correct way

274
00:17:40,667 --> 00:17:44,459
of    AUDIENCE MEMBER: Flight attendant!

275
00:17:44,459 --> 00:17:47,834
BALINT SEEBER: Flight attendant I'm old fashioned and she says

276
00:17:47,834 --> 00:17:49,501
is that off?

277
00:17:49,501 --> 00:17:52,167
And I said of course it is, it's just got the display

278
00:17:52,167 --> 00:17:57,918
off but it's cool because as you take off into the air you get interesting stats

279
00:17:57,918 --> 00:18:02,167
about how fast you're going and how high you are.

280
00:18:02,999 --> 00:18:06,083
Maybe it's me "geeking out" but I like the numbers.

281
00:18:06,959 --> 00:18:10,751
Once you get back home you can plug it into a GPS visualizer

282
00:18:10,751 --> 00:18:15,417
and Google Earth and you get a trail of where you've been.

283
00:18:15,459 --> 00:18:18,334
This was last year when I was going to Houston.

284
00:18:18,501 --> 00:18:22,334
These are screen shots from the GPS receiver.

285
00:18:22,959 --> 00:18:26,083
But if you're in the airplane and you're enjoying your ride,

286
00:18:26,083 --> 00:18:30,375
how do the skies remain safe and planes get around?

287
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:34,501
I would like to tell you a little bit about primary and secondary radar.

288
00:18:34,999 --> 00:18:38,501
You've seen these big rotating radars at airports and it's part

289
00:18:38,501 --> 00:18:41,751
of the ATC radar being consistent.

290
00:18:41,959 --> 00:18:45,292
The primary is the big one on the bottom and the secondary

291
00:18:45,292 --> 00:18:47,667
is the one at the top.

292
00:18:47,667 --> 00:18:49,999
The primary is the traditional radar where it sends

293
00:18:49,999 --> 00:18:53,834
out a pulse and listens for returns off metallic objects,

294
00:18:53,834 --> 00:18:56,999
because planes are flying tin cans.

295
00:18:57,501 --> 00:19:00,876
The range is limited by the radar equation.

296
00:19:01,792 --> 00:19:06,292
What's interesting, though, is that with the secondary system, the top

297
00:19:06,292 --> 00:19:10,334
is directional radio so that will actually broadcast and ping

298
00:19:10,334 --> 00:19:14,542
the transponders which are active on the airplane and ping back

299
00:19:14,542 --> 00:19:17,999
themselves so that requires an active system whereas

300
00:19:17,999 --> 00:19:21,876
the primary does not and because it's an active system and

301
00:19:21,876 --> 00:19:26,417
the transponder replies you have only second modal loss there and this

302
00:19:26,417 --> 00:19:31,083
is crucial because if you're sitting in front of the scope and you have

303
00:19:31,083 --> 00:19:34,083
the big line going around you wouldn't be able

304
00:19:34,083 --> 00:19:37,999
to ID individual planes but with the secondary system you

305
00:19:37,999 --> 00:19:40,709
would have those anonymous blips now coded

306
00:19:40,709 --> 00:19:44,167
with the score code that would have been assigned when

307
00:19:44,167 --> 00:19:48,876
they would have taken to the skies in the first place.

308
00:19:49,667 --> 00:19:52,375
How does the transponder system work?

309
00:19:52,375 --> 00:19:55,667
This is a basic one here and there are different modes.

310
00:19:55,667 --> 00:19:58,167
A will reply with a score code so when you take

311
00:19:58,167 --> 00:20:03,209
off you will get a code like that one, and then every time your transponder

312
00:20:03,209 --> 00:20:07,000
is interrogated it will send back a pulse.

313
00:20:07,042 --> 00:20:11,667
There is another one which is C and that will reply with the code and

314
00:20:11,667 --> 00:20:16,042
the current altitude which gives air traffic control more information

315
00:20:16,042 --> 00:20:18,417
about the air space.

316
00:20:18,709 --> 00:20:20,417
The cool one is Mode S.

317
00:20:20,417 --> 00:20:23,209
Who has heard of Mode S?

318
00:20:23,292 --> 00:20:27,999
All right, so Mode S is another system that runs on top

319
00:20:27,999 --> 00:20:32,834
of this and there is something that runs on top of that,

320
00:20:32,834 --> 00:20:36,834
which is ADB, which means the planes don't need

321
00:20:36,834 --> 00:20:41,417
to be interrogated they will continually broadcast this

322
00:20:41,417 --> 00:20:46,667
information out also part of that system is A cast and T cast

323
00:20:46,667 --> 00:20:52,375
and the interesting thing is part of the secondary system and Mode S

324
00:20:52,375 --> 00:20:57,709
is not part of it but it shares the same frequency which would

325
00:20:57,709 --> 00:21:02,751
reduce cost but now the problem is there are so many planes

326
00:21:02,751 --> 00:21:07,999
in the sky that the channel is becoming congested.

327
00:21:07,999 --> 00:21:11,250
I think Frankfurt has this problem the most due simply to the amount

328
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:13,999
of planes in the sky there.

329
00:21:16,125 --> 00:21:18,667
What does ADSB send out?

330
00:21:20,167 --> 00:21:24,542
It's constantly sending out a plane's position, hitting altitude,

331
00:21:24,542 --> 00:21:30,375
vertical rate, score code, quite a lot of things, those are the main ones.

332
00:21:30,918 --> 00:21:34,999
If ATC has antennas on the ground there can be

333
00:21:34,999 --> 00:21:41,834
transactions between ATC and the plane purely through the system.

334
00:21:41,834 --> 00:21:44,834
So ATC might send out a broadcast which is called

335
00:21:44,834 --> 00:21:50,083
the "all call" and all planes reply with the down link frame that identify

336
00:21:50,083 --> 00:21:52,626
the craft by its ID.

337
00:21:52,834 --> 00:21:54,999
Much like a mac address.

338
00:21:54,999 --> 00:21:59,417
Each air frame address is assigned to a single airplane.

339
00:21:59,792 --> 00:22:04,209
Then there is also ACAS and TCAS where the planes respond

340
00:22:04,209 --> 00:22:09,626
to one another and this can be used to augment collision avoidance,

341
00:22:09,626 --> 00:22:14,125
if they're traveling too close in one cockpit you may here

342
00:22:14,125 --> 00:22:20,292
the automated voice say "traffic" and if they get really close there might be

343
00:22:20,292 --> 00:22:25,292
a "pull off" and the other to do an avoidance maneuver and this

344
00:22:25,292 --> 00:22:30,999
is called a resolution advisory, but there have been terrible incidents

345
00:22:30,999 --> 00:22:34,667
in the past where the pilots have not followed

346
00:22:34,667 --> 00:22:38,584
the RAs and the planes have collided.

347
00:22:38,667 --> 00:22:41,459
The one I'm told in the past is the tragic one

348
00:22:41,459 --> 00:22:44,667
over Germany, there was a Russian flight with a lot

349
00:22:44,667 --> 00:22:48,667
of school children and they collide and had they all died and one

350
00:22:48,667 --> 00:22:52,584
of the father's went and killed the controller.

351
00:22:52,709 --> 00:22:56,999
So you got to pay attention to the resolution advisories!

352
00:22:58,083 --> 00:23:03,334
(Laughter.) I like to put big props out to Brad and Nick,

353
00:23:03,334 --> 00:23:08,709
they presented last year on looking to the vulnerabilities

354
00:23:08,709 --> 00:23:13,959
of Next Gen which employs all this stuff and I don't know

355
00:23:13,959 --> 00:23:19,083
whether Brad is here, but if you're here it would be great

356
00:23:19,083 --> 00:23:21,209
to catch up.

357
00:23:21,209 --> 00:23:25,999
The interesting thing is according to the 747,

358
00:23:25,999 --> 00:23:34,834
they have 31 radios so localities of things and that makes me happy!

359
00:23:36,999 --> 00:23:42,083
(Laughter.) When I was flying over here I took another photo

360
00:23:42,083 --> 00:23:47,501
of an aircraft like the one I was on and you can see there are

361
00:23:47,501 --> 00:23:51,584
a number of bumps coming out and don't quote me

362
00:23:51,584 --> 00:23:56,501
because I mapped it from a 747 I think it's roughly right

363
00:23:56,501 --> 00:24:01,209
but you've got the antenna, the transponder, high gain,

364
00:24:01,209 --> 00:24:07,292
satellite communications on the top, low gain VHF in the tail you have

365
00:24:07,292 --> 00:24:11,999
an HF antenna and on the bottom VHF things and radar,

366
00:24:11,999 --> 00:24:17,999
Al Tim meter and the marker and measurement equipment, too.

367
00:24:18,083 --> 00:24:22,751
Now with Mode S how is that encoded in the air?

368
00:24:22,751 --> 00:24:26,167
I showed you before what frequency shift might look

369
00:24:26,167 --> 00:24:30,167
like but this is called pulse position modulation

370
00:24:30,167 --> 00:24:33,999
which is technically AM but they send out pulls

371
00:24:33,999 --> 00:24:40,375
at precise times and when those pulses exist in a certain manner it might want

372
00:24:40,375 --> 00:24:42,751
mean a 1 or a 0.

373
00:24:42,999 --> 00:24:46,250
With Mode S there is a preamble sequence and

374
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:50,918
the pulses have to be in most positions and it indicates it

375
00:24:50,918 --> 00:24:55,999
is a Mode S packet and that's used to distinguish it from Modi and

376
00:24:55,999 --> 00:25:01,083
the payload is determined by the position of the chips.

377
00:25:01,209 --> 00:25:06,959
So this is Manchester encoded, and you can see the chips and one

378
00:25:06,959 --> 00:25:14,083
will relate to being a 1 and one to 0, and then the entire payload can be 56

379
00:25:14,083 --> 00:25:16,834
or 112 bits long.

380
00:25:18,334 --> 00:25:21,751
With pulse position modulation at those rates,

381
00:25:21,751 --> 00:25:25,999
a pulse lasts incredibly short amount of time.

382
00:25:26,417 --> 00:25:30,375
Now what this means is that you have to sample

383
00:25:30,375 --> 00:25:35,250
a at a minimum of 2 megahertz and it requires a bit

384
00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:41,876
of computing grunt to deal with that data rate and ideally you want

385
00:25:41,876 --> 00:25:47,999
to sample fast so you can correct for any time errors.

386
00:25:47,999 --> 00:25:51,584
So you couldn't be able to do this with your plain old radio so this

387
00:25:51,584 --> 00:25:55,334
is where Software Defined Radio comes in and this is where I got

388
00:25:55,334 --> 00:25:58,999
into it and this is my first play around with SDR because it's

389
00:25:58,999 --> 00:26:01,959
the perfect platform for this.

390
00:26:02,501 --> 00:26:08,584
SDR moves what was previously fixed in hardware, that sort of not

391
00:26:08,584 --> 00:26:14,584
the unconfigureable hardware into the software domain.

392
00:26:14,584 --> 00:26:17,626
Remember we had that simple crystal radio set?

393
00:26:17,667 --> 00:26:21,459
The expression of the AMD modulation in code

394
00:26:21,459 --> 00:26:26,876
is simply the magnitude of a complex vector.

395
00:26:26,959 --> 00:26:29,083
It's elegant and simple.

396
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:31,918
FM is more complicated but as elegant.

397
00:26:34,334 --> 00:26:37,876
So on the receive side instead of having everything done

398
00:26:37,876 --> 00:26:41,918
in hardware, all you do is you pick the carrier frequency you want

399
00:26:41,918 --> 00:26:44,999
to listen to, mix it with your incoming signal and

400
00:26:44,999 --> 00:26:48,459
all the rest you end up doing in software.

401
00:26:48,459 --> 00:26:51,584
So the purposes of SDR is to turn those values into digital

402
00:26:51,584 --> 00:26:56,292
and comply the computer with the stream that you can process.

403
00:26:56,417 --> 00:26:59,292
So the continuous turns into discrete.

404
00:26:59,999 --> 00:27:03,542
Again you have your wave, the converter to take it

405
00:27:03,542 --> 00:27:07,083
into the number stream and the converter going back

406
00:27:07,083 --> 00:27:11,792
the other way if you're going to transmit a signal.

407
00:27:11,792 --> 00:27:13,751
Naturally you're going to transmit legally

408
00:27:13,751 --> 00:27:17,876
because you have a license to transmit in that band.

409
00:27:17,876 --> 00:27:21,083
This is what I started playing with first, this is with the USRP1.

410
00:27:21,209 --> 00:27:26,999
It is sort of I guess one of the first if not the first low cost SDR,

411
00:27:26,999 --> 00:27:32,584
you hook it up by USB, depending on the data board you've got you had

412
00:27:32,584 --> 00:27:38,375
an amazing range and the bandwidth is incredible, this is one that came

413
00:27:38,375 --> 00:27:41,999
out later and the bandwidth here was narrow

414
00:27:41,999 --> 00:27:45,959
because cleverly they put an audio card in there

415
00:27:45,959 --> 00:27:50,375
because the left channel would be the right channel and

416
00:27:50,375 --> 00:27:55,667
the right channel would be the queue channel and it would appear

417
00:27:55,667 --> 00:27:57,999
as an audio card.

418
00:27:59,083 --> 00:28:01,501
But you needed to have the software running on top of that

419
00:28:01,501 --> 00:28:04,334
to demodulate whatever you wanted to listen to.

420
00:28:04,417 --> 00:28:07,999
And then, of course, there is the Real Tech one,

421
00:28:07,999 --> 00:28:11,959
anybody used it under Windows and ran it?

422
00:28:13,334 --> 00:28:15,999
I guess most people use it on the Linux?

423
00:28:16,584 --> 00:28:21,250
But for the price, it's pretty cool.

424
00:28:21,250 --> 00:28:25,167
I don't know if you're looking into the history but one of the modes

425
00:28:25,167 --> 00:28:29,334
in which it operates is that it can demodulate normal analog

426
00:28:29,334 --> 00:28:33,417
FM and it was figured out that it's streaming 8 bit samples

427
00:28:33,417 --> 00:28:36,209
to the computer and the community swarmed

428
00:28:36,209 --> 00:28:39,083
and figured out how to make that available

429
00:28:39,083 --> 00:28:41,375
to the mainstream.

430
00:28:41,667 --> 00:28:46,999
Now, this thing here, this is not an official announcement so I haven't

431
00:28:46,999 --> 00:28:49,626
put any text up there.

432
00:28:51,999 --> 00:28:53,918
Pretty excited about this.

433
00:28:53,918 --> 00:29:00,999
This is going to be very soon the new USB 3 radio.

434
00:29:00,999 --> 00:29:04,999
It has quite a frequency range, 50 megahertz, 56 megahertz

435
00:29:04,999 --> 00:29:09,834
of continuous bandwidth, it's pretty sweet and I've been having

436
00:29:09,834 --> 00:29:13,999
adventures with it around the Bay Area they'll tell you

437
00:29:13,999 --> 00:29:16,709
about in a little bit.

438
00:29:16,959 --> 00:29:20,999
The point is you can hook it up to your computer and run

439
00:29:20,999 --> 00:29:24,375
the radio and it as a GUI front end where you can

440
00:29:24,375 --> 00:29:28,999
describe the flow graph that would do modulation and demodulation

441
00:29:28,999 --> 00:29:31,999
in the graphic environment.

442
00:29:32,292 --> 00:29:39,959
This here is a demodulator for AM, you can see that the U.S.

443
00:29:39,959 --> 00:29:41,584
RP starts with the left hand side you have

444
00:29:41,584 --> 00:29:45,584
an FFT so you can see graphically what your signal looks like,

445
00:29:45,584 --> 00:29:51,083
an AMD modulate tore and it goes out to your sound card so it's simple.

446
00:29:53,375 --> 00:29:58,501
Here if you run a water fall over 8 megahertz this is part

447
00:29:58,501 --> 00:30:02,918
of the 2GSM band and you can see the channels and

448
00:30:02,918 --> 00:30:06,125
the traffic channels there.

449
00:30:08,999 --> 00:30:13,292
Then this is a pretty cool example of what you can do with this.

450
00:30:13,292 --> 00:30:15,999
This is actually 56 megahertz so what you're looking

451
00:30:15,999 --> 00:30:19,667
at in the middle are two wifi channels plus extra space

452
00:30:19,667 --> 00:30:23,999
on the side so you could decode to wifi channels.

453
00:30:25,417 --> 00:30:31,999
Over the years computers have become faster and smaller so it's cool how fast

454
00:30:31,999 --> 00:30:36,834
it's come to enable you to suck up bandwidth.

455
00:30:38,167 --> 00:30:46,209
This is another example, another program sorry, let me go back.

456
00:30:48,626 --> 00:30:53,000
There we go, so I was talking about pages back in Sidney, this

457
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:58,375
is an example of pages in the states, uses Flex, this is the Flex version

458
00:30:58,375 --> 00:31:01,083
of the page system and this is running

459
00:31:01,083 --> 00:31:06,542
in a program called Board Line, you can zoom right in there.

460
00:31:06,918 --> 00:31:10,125
I don't know if you can see but the line where the curse sore is,

461
00:31:10,125 --> 00:31:13,751
that's a single frequency that pager transmissions are sent

462
00:31:13,751 --> 00:31:16,083
on and you know how we saw the two levels

463
00:31:16,083 --> 00:31:19,459
of the pager I showed you in Sidney this has four levels

464
00:31:19,459 --> 00:31:22,999
and you can zoom down and if you don't know the properties

465
00:31:22,999 --> 00:31:25,876
of the signal you can use this analysis to figure

466
00:31:25,876 --> 00:31:31,125
out at a basic level what modulation they're using this is four level FSK.

467
00:31:33,083 --> 00:31:36,083
I'm sure you're aware of smart meters and how

468
00:31:36,083 --> 00:31:40,083
they had a mesh network in the megahertz ISM band you can see

469
00:31:40,083 --> 00:31:42,999
how quickly and short the bursts are coming

470
00:31:42,999 --> 00:31:46,250
from the meters but you can use Board Line to zoom

471
00:31:46,250 --> 00:31:50,083
in on that and you might not be able to tell what they are

472
00:31:50,083 --> 00:31:54,167
because the bursts are so short but if you zoom in you can see

473
00:31:54,167 --> 00:31:58,417
a face shift key one, the blurry one, on the left and the right

474
00:31:58,417 --> 00:32:01,999
of that there are narrow ones and although they're weak

475
00:32:01,999 --> 00:32:06,584
and only appear for a short period of time you can still have a look

476
00:32:06,584 --> 00:32:11,083
and identify that they're two level frequency shift key transmissions

477
00:32:11,083 --> 00:32:12,709
as well.

478
00:32:12,999 --> 00:32:14,999
Let's say you wanted to discover patents

479
00:32:14,999 --> 00:32:18,918
or repeating components to a signal that otherwise looks

480
00:32:18,918 --> 00:32:22,918
like noise, like, for example, anything CDMA.

481
00:32:22,999 --> 00:32:29,751
The examples here are that we would be listening to the GPS constellation

482
00:32:29,751 --> 00:32:33,209
or CDMA from the mobile phone network,

483
00:32:33,209 --> 00:32:35,334
for example.

484
00:32:35,918 --> 00:32:39,999
There is a sync called the fast auto correlation sync

485
00:32:39,999 --> 00:32:42,999
and what it does is trickery to determine

486
00:32:42,999 --> 00:32:46,999
whether FFTs are repeating in a signal.

487
00:32:47,834 --> 00:32:53,542
With CDMA you have signals are that are sharing frequency space divided

488
00:32:53,542 --> 00:32:56,250
by what code they use.

489
00:32:57,999 --> 00:33:03,250
Here there is a distinct line that appears on the 10 millisecond grid line

490
00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:07,667
and it's mostly black but there is a green line that appears

491
00:33:07,667 --> 00:33:11,709
up there and that is the 10 millisecond repeating common

492
00:33:11,709 --> 00:33:15,918
pilot channel and you can set a signal that you don't know

493
00:33:15,918 --> 00:33:20,334
about and put it in here and oh, it must be CDMA.

494
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:25,501
If you look at the constellation, it's all noise, there

495
00:33:25,501 --> 00:33:31,083
is no apparent signal like we saw before with the pager, for instance,

496
00:33:31,083 --> 00:33:36,626
because the signal is coming from the constellation, which is very,

497
00:33:36,626 --> 00:33:42,125
very far away and the signal is weak, however, there is CDMA in there

498
00:33:42,125 --> 00:33:47,667
and there is a repeating patent there as well and it's able to draw

499
00:33:47,667 --> 00:33:52,999
out the 1 millisecond repeating code in the GPS signal.

500
00:33:52,999 --> 00:33:57,292
So some pretty powerful tools that you can download and start using for free,

501
00:33:57,292 --> 00:34:00,751
Tetra is another land mobile radio digital standard

502
00:34:00,751 --> 00:34:03,751
and it has a characteristic repeating pattern

503
00:34:03,751 --> 00:34:07,125
at 14 milliseconds on an idle channel.

504
00:34:07,876 --> 00:34:11,959
The cool thing is you can take it out and about, I've put this

505
00:34:11,959 --> 00:34:14,709
in a used Bosch case of an electronic drill

506
00:34:14,709 --> 00:34:18,083
because I didn't have a case and these are my amateur

507
00:34:18,083 --> 00:34:22,375
friends back in Sidney, we set up a long wire and tried to listen

508
00:34:22,375 --> 00:34:27,083
to the world and you can pretty much capture the entire radio band which

509
00:34:27,083 --> 00:34:30,167
is what you're looking at there.

510
00:34:31,542 --> 00:34:36,834
It's not quiet but if you wanted to use this you can capture it

511
00:34:36,834 --> 00:34:42,209
and more and you can demodulate hands or weather fax transmissions

512
00:34:42,209 --> 00:34:46,626
or clandestine military codes and so on.

513
00:34:46,999 --> 00:34:52,834
These respect hands chatting in an allocated channel

514
00:34:52,834 --> 00:35:00,918
and you can have Morse Code and all sorts of interesting things and

515
00:35:00,918 --> 00:35:06,918
if you don't like that, you can video was supposed

516
00:35:06,918 --> 00:35:10,626
to start playing there.

517
00:35:17,876 --> 00:35:23,250
This is Citro Tower in San Francisco, and IDS is a popular carrier,

518
00:35:23,250 --> 00:35:26,667
and that's the base spectrum that you get

519
00:35:26,667 --> 00:35:32,959
and you have the decoder printing out all the information including traffic,

520
00:35:32,959 --> 00:35:36,876
the state of traffic on the highways there which

521
00:35:36,876 --> 00:35:41,959
is something that I'm very interested in and there you can see

522
00:35:41,959 --> 00:35:46,083
the demodulated FM so on the left hand side you have

523
00:35:46,083 --> 00:35:49,250
the mono audio, the backward compatible

524
00:35:49,250 --> 00:35:54,999
with nonstereo receivers which is 19 kill low heaters and then you can

525
00:35:54,999 --> 00:36:00,751
create the left and right channels and listen to the stereo and audio

526
00:36:00,751 --> 00:36:04,334
and you can see the sub carrier which encodes

527
00:36:04,334 --> 00:36:06,834
this information.

528
00:36:17,751 --> 00:36:22,459
Now it peeves me that the location codes are not given to you,

529
00:36:22,459 --> 00:36:26,834
and if you buy a car, that location system comes with it

530
00:36:26,834 --> 00:36:32,083
and I have been looking into one way of finding out this information,

531
00:36:32,083 --> 00:36:37,584
if you have any ideas, please, come and find me afterward.

532
00:36:37,918 --> 00:36:39,999
But if you want to do the reverse, if you want

533
00:36:39,999 --> 00:36:43,959
to make your own FM radio station and transmit your own information you

534
00:36:43,959 --> 00:36:45,542
can do that.

535
00:36:47,334 --> 00:36:53,626
I had my little iPod Nano with the FM radio in it that decodes

536
00:36:53,626 --> 00:37:00,083
and it's printing out a string that was preprinted out.

537
00:37:04,083 --> 00:37:06,959
I can't remember who I'm sorry to say

538
00:37:06,959 --> 00:37:12,125
but there was somebody that tested IDS injection and navigation display

539
00:37:12,125 --> 00:37:17,626
in a car and it was saying there was a terrorist threat of frogs falling

540
00:37:17,626 --> 00:37:21,125
from the sky or something (Laughter.) But if you

541
00:37:21,125 --> 00:37:26,542
like scanning around you can do that, too, I have a list of frequencies

542
00:37:26,542 --> 00:37:30,167
down the bottom, it steps through each one, there

543
00:37:30,167 --> 00:37:34,417
is a squelch block that monitors the channel and as soon

544
00:37:34,417 --> 00:37:38,959
as it goes quiet it goes to the next channel but the beauty

545
00:37:38,959 --> 00:37:43,792
of Software Defined Radio is you don't have to look at a channel,

546
00:37:43,792 --> 00:37:49,083
one single one at a time, there is a list I created that you can give it

547
00:37:49,083 --> 00:37:54,250
a spin and it will indicate that the channels that have become active

548
00:37:54,250 --> 00:37:58,083
and you have one sound card so the green one become

549
00:37:58,083 --> 00:38:01,999
the active one and the black ones are simultaneously

550
00:38:01,999 --> 00:38:05,876
active so this is voice but you might be listening

551
00:38:05,876 --> 00:38:09,083
to data codes and want to decode them all or

552
00:38:09,083 --> 00:38:13,334
if you're listening to one trunked channel you can record

553
00:38:13,334 --> 00:38:15,209
all of them.

554
00:38:15,209 --> 00:38:18,167
SDR is cool because there is an Open Source project to set

555
00:38:18,167 --> 00:38:20,999
up your own base station.

556
00:38:22,959 --> 00:38:27,999
I've done it once before, I set it up using this and I had my phone here

557
00:38:27,999 --> 00:38:32,167
and people can text me but I thought it might be distracting

558
00:38:32,167 --> 00:38:36,667
plus late last night I was trying to find a "free" channel and

559
00:38:36,667 --> 00:38:40,209
the spectrum is so unbelievably crowded that I gave

560
00:38:40,209 --> 00:38:44,626
up (Laughter.) It's cool because it comes with a soft switch,

561
00:38:44,626 --> 00:38:48,667
for example, I log on with my mobile phone and I can dial

562
00:38:48,667 --> 00:38:51,667
the outside world and I allocated a number

563
00:38:51,667 --> 00:38:55,709
with our main office switch and I'm able to receive calls

564
00:38:55,709 --> 00:39:00,250
and it goes through using the SIP over the network.

565
00:39:00,792 --> 00:39:04,999
So it had a big, popular debut at Burning Men and there was a bit

566
00:39:04,999 --> 00:39:10,209
of a computation to be done so they put the laptop on an ice pack.

567
00:39:11,375 --> 00:39:17,083
(Laughter.) Another cool thing you can do is there are blocks for decoding,

568
00:39:17,083 --> 00:39:22,292
RFD M version wifi so I put it up, I set the gain and the frequency

569
00:39:22,292 --> 00:39:27,834
and I made it so it will pass it through to Wire Shock and you can see

570
00:39:27,834 --> 00:39:31,167
the frames coming from the AP so this is just

571
00:39:31,167 --> 00:39:34,959
as if you had a dedicated wireless card running

572
00:39:34,959 --> 00:39:38,083
in monitor mode except that it's being done

573
00:39:38,083 --> 00:39:43,417
through an SDR and in that picture and picture there, another laptop

574
00:39:43,417 --> 00:39:46,918
is connecting to the network and you can see

575
00:39:46,918 --> 00:39:51,334
the association frame coming through and data frames coming

576
00:39:51,334 --> 00:39:55,834
through there, you can see the colored ones.

577
00:39:55,834 --> 00:39:59,083
Then actually last week a colleague of mine thought he would bring

578
00:39:59,083 --> 00:40:02,709
in his fancy antenna and we would receive pictures sent

579
00:40:02,709 --> 00:40:05,459
down from weather satellites, so they orbit

580
00:40:05,459 --> 00:40:09,459
the earth and then take photos and send them down and you have

581
00:40:09,459 --> 00:40:12,999
to track them manually but the B200, this guy is hanging

582
00:40:12,999 --> 00:40:17,083
out by the USB cable and you get these pictures.

583
00:40:17,167 --> 00:40:19,501
You see the interference there because doing

584
00:40:19,501 --> 00:40:23,083
the tracking manually you can't see it so we were guesstimating where it

585
00:40:23,083 --> 00:40:26,125
would be and I guessed we missed a spot!

586
00:40:26,626 --> 00:40:29,250
(Laughter.) But it's cool this is the west coast up here

587
00:40:29,250 --> 00:40:32,501
in fact United States and this is a big cloud formation,

588
00:40:32,501 --> 00:40:35,334
these pictures are taken with different sent sores

589
00:40:35,334 --> 00:40:38,584
and you can combine them into these false images, to get

590
00:40:38,584 --> 00:40:42,000
an idea of what's happening, this is sea temperature and there

591
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,626
is a thermal one and they happen all the time and you can get

592
00:40:45,626 --> 00:40:50,250
a program to tell you when the next pass will be and decode that.

593
00:40:50,918 --> 00:40:54,959
Another one, if you're looking for positional stuff

594
00:40:54,959 --> 00:41:00,501
on the water most large or medium size marine vessels contain their own

595
00:41:00,501 --> 00:41:05,876
version of trance ponders so I went to the Bay in San Francisco and

596
00:41:05,876 --> 00:41:09,542
the boat came around and there were three boats

597
00:41:09,542 --> 00:41:14,334
with that large cargo ship and they're all, you know, sending

598
00:41:14,334 --> 00:41:18,999
out their information and I guess the thing to bear in mind

599
00:41:18,999 --> 00:41:24,292
during all of this is it's all unencrypted, it's a shared resource,

600
00:41:24,292 --> 00:41:27,959
anybody can do anything with it.

601
00:41:27,959 --> 00:41:31,083
It's only our legal system with jurisdiction that dictates,

602
00:41:31,083 --> 00:41:34,667
apparently, how we're supposed to transmit or not

603
00:41:34,667 --> 00:41:38,751
within those frequencies so security is obviously a very,

604
00:41:38,751 --> 00:41:44,542
very big point that hasn't been addressed in a lot of these systems.

605
00:41:45,334 --> 00:41:47,999
So radio astronomy, tracking people

606
00:41:47,999 --> 00:41:53,209
with their mobile phones through shopping malls and so on.

607
00:41:53,209 --> 00:41:56,292
Let's come back to aviation, there is radar turning,

608
00:41:56,292 --> 00:42:00,999
Moffett Air Force Base in the Bay Area and every time it points

609
00:42:00,999 --> 00:42:04,167
toward the camera, there is a massive spike

610
00:42:04,167 --> 00:42:09,999
because it's directly in line with the pulse that is coming out.

611
00:42:10,209 --> 00:42:15,250
On the left hand side you can see the other spikes coming out.

612
00:42:15,250 --> 00:42:17,999
Theory flexes off large buildings so the radar signal

613
00:42:17,999 --> 00:42:22,501
is hitting those buildings and hitting back into the radio.

614
00:42:24,834 --> 00:42:28,334
The other thing is I couldn't figure out why I was seeing two peaks here,

615
00:42:28,334 --> 00:42:31,083
this is showing the time in between the initial bang that

616
00:42:31,083 --> 00:42:34,584
is sent out, the initial pulse that is sent out by the radar and this

617
00:42:34,584 --> 00:42:37,626
is called the pulse repetition frequency and I couldn't figure

618
00:42:37,626 --> 00:42:40,999
out why there were two, usually there is only one.

619
00:42:41,083 --> 00:42:48,334
Before I had an SDR that went up this high, who knows the ubiquitous,

620
00:42:48,334 --> 00:42:52,250
4C, to 11K wifi cards, yeah?

621
00:42:54,083 --> 00:42:58,626
It's got in the chip set a radar detections capability so I was

622
00:42:58,626 --> 00:43:02,167
using that to characterize the weather radar nearby

623
00:43:02,167 --> 00:43:07,542
but here there were two and I did a little bit of research and these radars

624
00:43:07,542 --> 00:43:12,083
apart from monitoring aircraft can be made to monitor weather and

625
00:43:12,083 --> 00:43:16,834
in this mode there were papers written about how they can be used

626
00:43:16,834 --> 00:43:21,083
to monitor reflectivity and moisture in the air.

627
00:43:21,083 --> 00:43:22,125
That was kinda cool.

628
00:43:22,459 --> 00:43:28,083
On the Water Fall display this is what modes transponders look like.

629
00:43:34,999 --> 00:43:41,125
You can see wave the pay load and the FM, and what does that look like?

630
00:43:42,417 --> 00:43:45,999
All those dots represent a frame and if you run it realtime you would

631
00:43:45,999 --> 00:43:47,501
see that.

632
00:43:47,501 --> 00:43:48,375
The amplitudes are different all the time

633
00:43:48,375 --> 00:43:51,459
because you're seeing different planes that are different distances away

634
00:43:51,459 --> 00:43:53,209
from your receiver.

635
00:43:53,292 --> 00:43:57,999
Once you've done the decoding, what's next?

636
00:43:57,999 --> 00:43:59,999
This is a project I've been working on now and then,

637
00:43:59,999 --> 00:44:02,542
who has seen "Sneakers" ?

638
00:44:04,501 --> 00:44:05,918
Thought so.

639
00:44:05,999 --> 00:44:09,999
One of my favorite bits in the film I'm not doing to do

640
00:44:09,999 --> 00:44:13,375
an American accent but the diagnostics, what's

641
00:44:13,375 --> 00:44:18,083
in the black book and you can see on the screen a simple picture

642
00:44:18,083 --> 00:44:21,459
of the Bay Area with air photographic control

643
00:44:21,459 --> 00:44:25,751
and planes and I put together my own system that does it,

644
00:44:25,751 --> 00:44:31,292
that's San Francisco airport right there and I left it running and these are

645
00:44:31,292 --> 00:44:37,083
the planes that fly in and out of the air, San Francisco, San Jose and Oakland,

646
00:44:37,083 --> 00:44:42,709
so they leave trails behind and you can see the flight paths.

647
00:44:42,709 --> 00:44:46,709
This is the rainbow affect, this is a bad transponder

648
00:44:46,709 --> 00:44:51,125
on an aircraft that is transmitting false information

649
00:44:51,125 --> 00:44:56,417
and you can see how SFO is actually right in the center there

650
00:44:56,417 --> 00:45:02,417
and the color code indicates altitude so the yellow is just before its

651
00:45:02,417 --> 00:45:04,667
about to land.

652
00:45:04,667 --> 00:45:06,999
This is the airport there with the various runways,

653
00:45:06,999 --> 00:45:11,584
obviously we all know there was a bit of an accident down there recently.

654
00:45:12,626 --> 00:45:17,918
I went up on top of a car park nearby, this is the runway and I had

655
00:45:17,918 --> 00:45:22,999
the 800 receiving and you can see the parallel approaches, and this

656
00:45:22,999 --> 00:45:27,999
is about to turn red once the wheels at this time the tarmac and

657
00:45:27,999 --> 00:45:34,083
they will scoot across the screen as they taxi into the terminal.

658
00:45:35,999 --> 00:45:40,999
So landings are cool, take offs are kinda cool, too.

659
00:45:40,999 --> 00:45:44,709
Especially if you're just sitting there you can see the planes

660
00:45:44,709 --> 00:45:48,375
at the holding point waiting to take off.

661
00:45:48,792 --> 00:45:50,999
I think this is a Virgin flight.

662
00:45:54,999 --> 00:45:56,751
There it goes.

663
00:45:56,751 --> 00:46:01,125
Again, it's kinda neat, we have the GPS, watching the velocities increase

664
00:46:01,125 --> 00:46:05,999
and eventually when the nose and wheel lifts up, turns green and

665
00:46:05,999 --> 00:46:08,876
off it goes into the sky.

666
00:46:10,792 --> 00:46:13,709
Wouldn't it be cool if you could do it in 3D as well?

667
00:46:13,709 --> 00:46:15,918
That's the same plane now streaming in Google Earth

668
00:46:15,918 --> 00:46:18,876
through the internet (Laughter.) You can see planes

669
00:46:18,876 --> 00:46:22,250
in the background landing at Oakland there.

670
00:46:24,083 --> 00:46:26,834
That's the Bay Area there.

671
00:46:26,999 --> 00:46:30,083
Wouldn't it also be cool if you could actually have

672
00:46:30,083 --> 00:46:34,125
a virtual cockpit mode so that you can be in the seat of the pilot,

673
00:46:34,125 --> 00:46:38,459
imagine what it would be like taking off into the sky!

674
00:46:42,834 --> 00:46:46,334
(Laughter.) (Applause.) So this is actually running permanently

675
00:46:46,334 --> 00:46:50,334
on my web site for Sidney Australia and I've just set this up recently

676
00:46:50,334 --> 00:46:52,834
for the Bay Area as well.

677
00:46:52,918 --> 00:46:55,667
So if you would like to sort of help out with this project I would love

678
00:46:55,667 --> 00:46:57,250
to hear from you.

679
00:47:03,459 --> 00:47:06,792
This was actually when I had one of these tucked away

680
00:47:06,792 --> 00:47:11,083
in the seat pocket in front of me without an antenna and I was receiving

681
00:47:11,083 --> 00:47:14,959
the transponder from 10 meters below my butt, and it's a bit

682
00:47:14,959 --> 00:47:19,417
of a hard landing, but it's kinda cool, because as you taxi in you can see

683
00:47:19,417 --> 00:47:22,459
the burnt out fuselage of planes.

684
00:47:22,459 --> 00:47:24,999
I don't know what Google Earth tried to do there!

685
00:47:25,542 --> 00:47:28,999
(Laughter.) You know how it does the terrain exaggeration,

686
00:47:28,999 --> 00:47:32,999
they must have automatic mechanisms to determine terrain elevation,

687
00:47:32,999 --> 00:47:37,083
but it's weird when you're flying through like that.

688
00:47:38,375 --> 00:47:41,999
If you do it in Google Earth, you get the same affect, here

689
00:47:41,999 --> 00:47:45,083
the trails don't persist so it doesn't get as crowded

690
00:47:45,083 --> 00:47:48,834
but you can kinda get a sense when there is a lot of traffic,

691
00:47:48,834 --> 00:47:53,083
and you can see when see how it didn't come in on the direct path there,

692
00:47:53,083 --> 00:47:57,083
around the ocean it does loops, see that loop there, that's when ATC

693
00:47:57,083 --> 00:47:59,876
is backed up and I'm guessing they're asking

694
00:47:59,876 --> 00:48:03,667
the planes to hold for a single loop to give them breathing room

695
00:48:03,667 --> 00:48:06,209
before they vector them in.

696
00:48:08,334 --> 00:48:10,125
So what's this one?

697
00:48:10,125 --> 00:48:15,501
Oh, yeah, this is when the police came out!

698
00:48:15,501 --> 00:48:16,918
(Laughter.) Hello there.

699
00:48:16,918 --> 00:48:18,792
Are you really watching airplanes?

700
00:48:22,751 --> 00:48:24,292
BALINT SEEBER: I am.

701
00:48:24,292 --> 00:48:26,459
Do you have ID on you?

702
00:48:26,459 --> 00:48:30,999
BALINT SEEBER: Die.

703
00:48:30,999 --> 00:48:32,667
Is it for school or something?

704
00:48:32,667 --> 00:48:33,292
(Laughter.)    BALINT SEEBER: It wasn't quite for school

705
00:48:33,292 --> 00:48:35,459
but she was very nice about it.

706
00:48:35,542 --> 00:48:39,083
That's not the first time that I've had encounters with the cops

707
00:48:39,083 --> 00:48:41,999
but usually they're pretty good.

708
00:48:42,375 --> 00:48:45,999
So the software runs in a couple of different stages this

709
00:48:45,999 --> 00:48:49,918
is the desktop application that does the tracking, you have

710
00:48:49,918 --> 00:48:53,209
the decoding and then do the tracking.

711
00:48:53,209 --> 00:48:57,999
This is the main runway at Sidney, you can see the trails and

712
00:48:57,999 --> 00:49:03,834
the planes left behind, I have to thank my deer friend, Matt Robert,

713
00:49:03,834 --> 00:49:08,918
he has worked on OP 25 and I was using his U.S.

714
00:49:08,918 --> 00:49:11,209
RP 1 remotely and we would go up to the park and test it

715
00:49:11,209 --> 00:49:13,250
out there because the airport was

716
00:49:13,250 --> 00:49:15,876
within visible distance.

717
00:49:16,125 --> 00:49:20,584
We went up a couple more times, progressively taking more equipment

718
00:49:20,584 --> 00:49:24,083
and we were excited because that gray plane there isn't

719
00:49:24,083 --> 00:49:26,792
actually a plane it's a vehicle equipped

720
00:49:26,792 --> 00:49:30,918
with April transponder it's on a perimeter road and now they're

721
00:49:30,918 --> 00:49:34,167
all equipped and you can see all the vehicles moving

722
00:49:34,167 --> 00:49:37,999
around and I need to change the eye con to something more

723
00:49:37,999 --> 00:49:40,709
like a car but we were happy that evening,

724
00:49:40,709 --> 00:49:44,959
we had quite a bit of equipment up there as well.

725
00:49:45,167 --> 00:49:49,959
But you see interesting things, that was the queen when she came

726
00:49:49,959 --> 00:49:55,250
to visit, the call sign is RGL1, Regal 1, and I was in San Francisco

727
00:49:55,250 --> 00:50:00,167
and I saw that, I don't know what that was about.

728
00:50:00,918 --> 00:50:04,417
And this is when I without permission moved my

729
00:50:04,417 --> 00:50:07,959
equipment to the roof of the apartment block

730
00:50:07,959 --> 00:50:13,000
and had everything stuffed in this box I had gigabyte and ether net

731
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:18,667
in a box sprayed the same color of the building (Laughter.) And you can

732
00:50:18,667 --> 00:50:21,999
extract information about the distribution

733
00:50:21,999 --> 00:50:24,999
of the strengths of the packets coming

734
00:50:24,999 --> 00:50:29,999
in and you build up these graphs to tell you how well your decoder

735
00:50:29,999 --> 00:50:34,834
is doing, this is a graph of signal strength versus distance

736
00:50:34,834 --> 00:50:38,999
and you can see the way that it drops off.

737
00:50:39,167 --> 00:50:40,375
This is altitude versus distance

738
00:50:40,375 --> 00:50:43,999
because I live close to the airport they all come to a single point

739
00:50:43,999 --> 00:50:45,999
in the lot tomorrow left but you can see

740
00:50:45,999 --> 00:50:49,709
out to the right where the planes will descend to.

741
00:50:52,125 --> 00:50:55,792
And you can see them coming out on the right hand side there,

742
00:50:55,792 --> 00:50:57,999
but on the other axis.

743
00:50:58,375 --> 00:51:04,999
This one is Sidney, now, Australia has a greater roll out of ADSB.

744
00:51:05,459 --> 00:51:08,209
In addition to listen to go their messages see how

745
00:51:08,209 --> 00:51:11,999
the balloons are popping out these are aid car messages,

746
00:51:11,999 --> 00:51:16,125
and there is another rainbow affect but the text messages can be

747
00:51:16,125 --> 00:51:20,999
between the cockpit, air traffic control, messages back to Royals Royce,

748
00:51:20,999 --> 00:51:24,999
I saw once a rowdy person had been on the plane and they asked

749
00:51:24,999 --> 00:51:28,959
for an escort and most of it is clear text.

750
00:51:32,292 --> 00:51:38,999
AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Away from mic.)    BALINT SEEBER:

751
00:51:38,999 --> 00:51:41,501
Generally no.

752
00:51:44,125 --> 00:51:48,459
Once again this is looking down at Sidney airport and you can see

753
00:51:48,459 --> 00:51:51,834
when a message is sent it deposits a little Marker

754
00:51:51,834 --> 00:51:54,125
behind and most of the messages occur

755
00:51:54,125 --> 00:51:57,999
at the airport it's the way that diagnostic symptoms work

756
00:51:57,999 --> 00:52:00,999
and I've mentioned that already.

757
00:52:02,999 --> 00:52:05,501
I listened to the two primary frequencies back

758
00:52:05,501 --> 00:52:09,125
home and I'm set that go up here as well but this is how the message

759
00:52:09,125 --> 00:52:12,501
is printed out, so the frequency, the content, the flight ID

760
00:52:12,501 --> 00:52:14,876
and registration, so on.

761
00:52:14,876 --> 00:52:24,125
What does it sound like, that's an aid car message, there.

762
00:52:24,125 --> 00:52:28,501
(Hissing noise) And this is decoding the main channels in the Bay Area

763
00:52:28,501 --> 00:52:32,459
and that can be fit into the main system to put spatially

764
00:52:32,459 --> 00:52:36,542
on the map where the aircraft was when it transmitted that

765
00:52:36,542 --> 00:52:40,501
information so it's interesting sort of a diagnostic tool

766
00:52:40,501 --> 00:52:46,250
for airplane operations I guess or if you like to be a plane spotter.

767
00:52:47,083 --> 00:52:51,375
So you can see a whole bunch of engineering messages which have

768
00:52:51,375 --> 00:52:55,083
the H1 label were delivered as it was coming into land

769
00:52:55,083 --> 00:52:57,999
or pass through the airport.

770
00:52:57,999 --> 00:53:02,417
This is sped up, you say a big blue dot, and I'll explain that but you can see

771
00:53:02,417 --> 00:53:06,999
the dots appearing as they take off which is when the plane sends

772
00:53:06,999 --> 00:53:11,584
out a lot of information as it ascends into the sky.

773
00:53:11,999 --> 00:53:15,167
So here are examples, this is a running joke.

774
00:53:15,876 --> 00:53:18,999
I see probably just because I'm hypersensitive

775
00:53:18,999 --> 00:53:24,709
to it now I see aid car messages regarding blocked toilets on aircraft.

776
00:53:25,083 --> 00:53:30,999
So here we have one toilet that's inoperative and I'm guessing LAV hard

777
00:53:30,999 --> 00:53:34,459
means it's failed and because I see them

778
00:53:34,459 --> 00:53:38,751
all the time I thought I would make a Easter egg

779
00:53:38,751 --> 00:53:42,999
in Google earth (Laughter.) Unfortunately I think

780
00:53:42,999 --> 00:53:48,999
the white point that's been highlighted there is Prawn.

781
00:53:50,959 --> 00:53:55,876
Now they send out flight paths over aid cars using white points

782
00:53:55,876 --> 00:53:59,751
and actually it will draw in the flight paths that

783
00:53:59,751 --> 00:54:02,999
the planes should fly through.

784
00:54:02,999 --> 00:54:06,542
I'm only receiving a small portion but you would expect the plane

785
00:54:06,542 --> 00:54:10,999
to fly through to Asia and Perth and also there are nice things I don't

786
00:54:10,999 --> 00:54:14,209
know why these planes appear in Google Earth as models,

787
00:54:14,209 --> 00:54:18,375
maybe Quantas is paying Google Earth, I don't know.

788
00:54:22,834 --> 00:54:28,250
You saw I put all that stuff up on the roof without asking

789
00:54:28,250 --> 00:54:33,083
and there was a message that several trades people

790
00:54:33,083 --> 00:54:39,250
installed things on the roof and it was just little old me, which

791
00:54:39,250 --> 00:54:46,083
is kind of a tin can thing and they made a big fuss about it.

792
00:54:46,626 --> 00:54:51,083
But two nights before I left for the states I said "stuff them" I put

793
00:54:51,083 --> 00:54:55,083
everything in a box, this was the night before I was supposed

794
00:54:55,083 --> 00:54:59,083
to get on the plane installing it at a this is as I was taking

795
00:54:59,083 --> 00:55:02,167
off in the plane I took a photo of the site and

796
00:55:02,167 --> 00:55:07,501
with a little real tech dongle over here, I didn't have internet so I didn't have

797
00:55:07,501 --> 00:55:11,834
maps and so forth but it was cool to pick up where the plane was,

798
00:55:11,834 --> 00:55:15,876
that's more recently in LA, you can get good range when you're

799
00:55:15,876 --> 00:55:19,459
nice and high and this is more recently when I'm sitting

800
00:55:19,459 --> 00:55:21,501
up new antennas.

801
00:55:21,584 --> 00:55:25,584
Instead of Mode S you can use HF, and we were able

802
00:55:25,584 --> 00:55:31,959
to receive HF transmissions which work on a slightly different system extending

803
00:55:31,959 --> 00:55:36,417
all the bay as you can see there into China and India, so

804
00:55:36,417 --> 00:55:39,959
with HF you have for greater propagation so

805
00:55:39,959 --> 00:55:42,834
the range is incredible.

806
00:55:43,999 --> 00:55:47,083
So that's more or less aviation.

807
00:55:48,167 --> 00:55:51,792
Remember it's all unencrypted so you can spoof, jam,

808
00:55:51,792 --> 00:55:56,959
all that kind of stuff and I will talk more about that later.

809
00:56:01,083 --> 00:56:04,209
AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Away from mic.)    BALINT SEEBER:

810
00:56:04,209 --> 00:56:06,876
I haven't looked into this.

811
00:56:06,999 --> 00:56:10,459
AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Away from mic.)    BALINT SEEBER: The

812
00:56:10,459 --> 00:56:14,751
question was there is another part of this called TISBE, that

813
00:56:14,751 --> 00:56:17,125
is broadcast over the same mechanism

814
00:56:17,125 --> 00:56:20,999
and that's used to augment information that pilots can

815
00:56:20,999 --> 00:56:25,334
see but it's a "next step" in the protocol and isn't widespread

816
00:56:25,334 --> 00:56:31,792
but various sites are bringing it online but I haven't looked at that myself.

817
00:56:35,999 --> 00:56:38,999
AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Away from mic.)    BALINT SEEBER:

818
00:56:38,999 --> 00:56:41,709
I haven't done that, but that's actually good

819
00:56:41,709 --> 00:56:45,417
for potentially doing mach alliteration, in the absence of Mode S

820
00:56:45,417 --> 00:56:47,083
and maybe SP.

821
00:56:49,417 --> 00:56:54,626
Moving on, this is a blind spot here and you have no idea what you're doing

822
00:56:54,626 --> 00:56:59,959
and I was looking at satellites, going to a friend's place and hooking my USB

823
00:56:59,959 --> 00:57:04,792
up to his set top box connected to a satellite and there were two types

824
00:57:04,792 --> 00:57:07,542
of two things to consider.

825
00:57:08,375 --> 00:57:13,584
You got the purpose and the payload so we can have comms,

826
00:57:13,584 --> 00:57:20,792
amateur radio satellites and the intelligent ones and the dumb ones.

827
00:57:20,792 --> 00:57:24,542
The intelligent once you communicate with them from the ground

828
00:57:24,542 --> 00:57:27,834
and instruct them to do things or there are

829
00:57:27,834 --> 00:57:31,083
the dumb ones that relay information and it's

830
00:57:31,083 --> 00:57:35,999
like a big RF mega phone so you send up your million TV channels

831
00:57:35,999 --> 00:57:39,834
and it beams it back down to the ground so everyone

832
00:57:39,834 --> 00:57:44,834
with satellite TV can watch without having cable run.

833
00:57:45,999 --> 00:57:50,292
The satellite is just like that, it operates in these ranges and it's used

834
00:57:50,292 --> 00:57:52,999
for television with other interesting things

835
00:57:52,999 --> 00:57:57,792
and I thought, well, let's have a look at what's going on there.

836
00:57:57,792 --> 00:58:01,167
These are the publically available frequencies,

837
00:58:01,167 --> 00:58:06,709
how the transponders are broken up, the uplink power control frequencies,

838
00:58:06,709 --> 00:58:11,999
and this is a constant power signal that comes down to inform the ground

839
00:58:11,999 --> 00:58:16,999
of how much power it should send back up, depending on the amount

840
00:58:16,999 --> 00:58:21,542
of moisture in the atmosphere, cloud cover and so on they have

841
00:58:21,542 --> 00:58:25,292
to change the amount of power on the ground so that

842
00:58:25,292 --> 00:58:29,999
the signal ends up hitting the satellite and that has security

843
00:58:29,999 --> 00:58:32,250
implications, too.

844
00:58:35,083 --> 00:58:39,250
This is the earth station where they send the signals up.

845
00:58:39,250 --> 00:58:42,999
If you look on the map it contains the TV, media agencies, if you look

846
00:58:42,999 --> 00:58:46,751
at the photo they took inside you can with a bit of research,

847
00:58:46,751 --> 00:58:50,334
remember that modem I showed you at the beginning, that rack

848
00:58:50,334 --> 00:58:54,375
is if you feel them so you can look at the manual.

849
00:58:54,626 --> 00:58:59,542
They have various other sort of more or less well known antenna satellite

850
00:58:59,542 --> 00:59:04,626
control systems so what do you need to decode these signals?

851
00:59:04,999 --> 00:59:08,083
You need a satellite, a dish, you need a set top box, some sort

852
00:59:08,083 --> 00:59:10,834
of down converter and an SDR.

853
00:59:10,834 --> 00:59:13,417
If you're going to look at narrow band stuff you have

854
00:59:13,417 --> 00:59:16,959
to get a down converter that has high stability.

855
00:59:16,959 --> 00:59:18,959
Usually the ones for satellite TV are cheap

856
00:59:18,959 --> 00:59:21,709
because they can drift bought that's okay

857
00:59:21,709 --> 00:59:25,626
because the TV signals are broadband and it's not the case

858
00:59:25,626 --> 00:59:28,083
with narrow band stuff.

859
00:59:28,209 --> 00:59:31,334
If you do a search for the satellite the manufacturer

860
00:59:31,334 --> 00:59:35,375
of the transponder lists them and you can look up what kind

861
00:59:35,375 --> 00:59:38,250
of modulation would be used.

862
00:59:47,834 --> 00:59:53,584
This is a telemetry analyses coming down and this is actually zooming

863
00:59:53,584 --> 00:59:59,209
into the telemetry signals and you can do visualization.

864
00:59:59,209 --> 01:00:04,918
I didn't look much further from this, but who can tell me what these

865
01:00:04,918 --> 01:00:07,334
shapes indicate?

866
01:00:07,334 --> 01:00:08,999
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Counters.

867
01:00:08,999 --> 01:00:10,250
BALINT SEEBER: Exactly.

868
01:00:10,375 --> 01:00:13,292
You can see something going on there and that might be

869
01:00:13,292 --> 01:00:17,334
a starting point and there are other narrow band streams coming

870
01:00:17,334 --> 01:00:22,250
down and you pick one and lock on to it and try and decode it.

871
01:00:22,459 --> 01:00:26,999
The problem is because you're going in blind when you initially send

872
01:00:26,999 --> 01:00:30,542
out the signal you have to specify these parameters so

873
01:00:30,542 --> 01:00:34,834
if you are differentially encoding them, doing error correction,

874
01:00:34,834 --> 01:00:37,334
you don't have any idea.

875
01:00:37,792 --> 01:00:40,918
So doing it in reverse you have to go through all the permutations

876
01:00:40,918 --> 01:00:43,751
and it can make your head explode.

877
01:00:45,834 --> 01:00:47,999
So if you don't know, basically you try

878
01:00:47,999 --> 01:00:50,999
the most common ones, try and automate and script it and

879
01:00:50,999 --> 01:00:54,459
the idea is that you can sort of use some hints along the way

880
01:00:54,459 --> 01:00:57,667
to determine how successful your being.

881
01:00:57,918 --> 01:01:02,125
So most satellite signals are phase shift keyed, which means

882
01:01:02,125 --> 01:01:06,999
instead of changing the frequency they change the phase for each 1

883
01:01:06,999 --> 01:01:11,709
and 0 that's sent through, each symbol, technically and you need

884
01:01:11,709 --> 01:01:15,709
to determine the order being used, and the symbol rate,

885
01:01:15,709 --> 01:01:19,334
how they're sending the how quickly they're sending

886
01:01:19,334 --> 01:01:22,751
the data through and I saw these transmissions

887
01:01:22,751 --> 01:01:26,999
and I thought I would puck one of those and you can multiply

888
01:01:26,999 --> 01:01:32,375
or raise the signal itself to the power, raise it to the fourth power and

889
01:01:32,375 --> 01:01:35,709
as soon as you get the peaks, it's indicative

890
01:01:35,709 --> 01:01:38,876
of the fact that you've hit the right order

891
01:01:38,876 --> 01:01:42,209
of modulation so this was order 4.

892
01:01:42,542 --> 01:01:46,999
So we have QPSQ which means in each symbol transmitted

893
01:01:46,999 --> 01:01:51,209
through there are two binary bits.

894
01:01:51,792 --> 01:01:54,999
Also we need to find out how quickly they're being sent

895
01:01:54,999 --> 01:01:58,999
through and you can do this using what's called stationery analysis

896
01:01:58,999 --> 01:02:02,834
and you multiply the natural by a lagged version of its and that

897
01:02:02,834 --> 01:02:07,083
will reveal components and it turns out to be 9600 baud.

898
01:02:09,083 --> 01:02:13,292
And it's error corrected and without figuring out what

899
01:02:13,292 --> 01:02:19,209
the convolutional decoders are you're going to be left with noise so the idea

900
01:02:19,209 --> 01:02:23,918
is you go through all of them until you find the error rate

901
01:02:23,918 --> 01:02:26,999
from the decoder drops to 0.

902
01:02:26,999 --> 01:02:30,083
So if it's designed to decode convolutional codes, there

903
01:02:30,083 --> 01:02:34,083
is a metric count that it keeps inside, and when you hit

904
01:02:34,083 --> 01:02:38,083
the parameters that will drop to 0 or close to and that's

905
01:02:38,083 --> 01:02:43,209
the hint that you've been able to identify the parameters.

906
01:02:43,459 --> 01:02:47,834
So you can see he there, that drops to 0 which means I've got

907
01:02:47,834 --> 01:02:49,999
the right code.

908
01:02:50,209 --> 01:02:52,999
This is a flow graph that emulates that process.

909
01:02:53,834 --> 01:02:58,375
Going through the permutations, it's cool because it's Open Source

910
01:02:58,375 --> 01:03:02,876
and you can extend it any way you wish and instead of me trying

911
01:03:02,876 --> 01:03:06,083
all the buttons out I made a model that would go

912
01:03:06,083 --> 01:03:09,918
through each permutation and find where it was locked

913
01:03:09,918 --> 01:03:13,709
and I could proceed with the next stage so you have 1's

914
01:03:13,709 --> 01:03:17,876
and 0's again, looks like there is structure in there, not,

915
01:03:17,876 --> 01:03:20,999
but it looks like it's been probably scrambled,

916
01:03:20,999 --> 01:03:24,999
which is a common thing to do to sort of widen the data

917
01:03:24,999 --> 01:03:28,999
in case there are any pending patents, to keep it as pseudo

918
01:03:28,999 --> 01:03:32,542
as you can once you find an RF link.

919
01:03:33,667 --> 01:03:39,792
I found a couple of popular once and turns out it's still not quite right so

920
01:03:39,792 --> 01:03:45,542
it's probably differentially encode and had if you decode it you can see

921
01:03:45,542 --> 01:03:49,999
repeating patterns and headers and payloads.

922
01:03:50,292 --> 01:03:55,083
So now you have that structure and you can go through and search

923
01:03:55,083 --> 01:04:00,626
for the repeating patterns and I discovered this pattern that would

924
01:04:00,626 --> 01:04:04,876
be established and the preamble would indicate what

925
01:04:04,876 --> 01:04:10,542
looked like packets and it turned out to be ancient character oriented

926
01:04:10,542 --> 01:04:12,918
packet assembly.

927
01:04:13,918 --> 01:04:18,792
So you have synchronization, CIC, at the end, and a number

928
01:04:18,792 --> 01:04:23,083
of fixed length messages within these packets coming

929
01:04:23,083 --> 01:04:26,792
down from this satellite and each contains

930
01:04:26,792 --> 01:04:31,542
an ID and I wrote a pauser for that, and I wrote a patent

931
01:04:31,542 --> 01:04:37,167
between each successive transmission and what it looks like header,

932
01:04:37,167 --> 01:04:41,999
you have varying codes, and basically they and I thought,

933
01:04:41,999 --> 01:04:45,083
Hmmm what could that be?

934
01:04:45,083 --> 01:04:48,999
Well I have no idea but if you graph them they look pretty!

935
01:04:51,876 --> 01:04:55,542
(Laughter.) So I thought they're probably some sort

936
01:04:55,542 --> 01:04:59,999
of measurement maybe that's proceeding, time, if you plot XY,

937
01:04:59,999 --> 01:05:04,542
they might move around like this, they might be telemetry being

938
01:05:04,542 --> 01:05:08,709
uploaded, I am sad that I wasn't able to record more data

939
01:05:08,709 --> 01:05:13,876
because I only recorded 2 minutes worth but if you record it for a week

940
01:05:13,876 --> 01:05:18,542
or month you could graph this and see how it would change related

941
01:05:18,542 --> 01:05:23,999
to the time of day and if it's human activity or phenomenon.

942
01:05:28,542 --> 01:05:33,501
This is a downlink and I think people are using a part

943
01:05:33,501 --> 01:05:37,999
of a shared satellite spectrum there.

944
01:05:37,999 --> 01:05:41,999
This is one I could not figure out, you see ha hump there,

945
01:05:41,999 --> 01:05:47,792
there might be a signal moderator, I was running all sorts of tricks,

946
01:05:47,792 --> 01:05:53,083
nothing came out of it and in the end I found satellite frequency

947
01:05:53,083 --> 01:05:55,918
allocation for a U.S.

948
01:05:55,918 --> 01:05:58,751
satellite and it turns out they put white noise channels

949
01:05:58,751 --> 01:06:02,459
through the satellites to do presumably RF measurement

950
01:06:02,459 --> 01:06:06,667
and test being so there is nothing encoded there it's purely

951
01:06:06,667 --> 01:06:08,459
white noise.

952
01:06:08,459 --> 01:06:09,999
(Laughter.)    AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Away

953
01:06:09,999 --> 01:06:14,876
from mic.)    BALINT SEEBER: Well, if it was one time than it would be

954
01:06:14,876 --> 01:06:19,209
digital so there would be a digital artifact there.

955
01:06:19,626 --> 01:06:26,626
But this was well and truly as far as I could tell anyway, white.

956
01:06:26,999 --> 01:06:31,083
Back coming down to earth again, signals to earth,

957
01:06:31,083 --> 01:06:36,584
it's well documented and you can run an analysis that runs

958
01:06:36,584 --> 01:06:43,083
at 2400 baud which is indicative of the baud rate again and if you run

959
01:06:43,083 --> 01:06:49,542
the correlation it matches exactly with the detecting frame links and

960
01:06:49,542 --> 01:06:53,125
if you have a blind signal and you have

961
01:06:53,125 --> 01:06:59,209
a database you can look at them and ID them opinion if you create

962
01:06:59,209 --> 01:07:03,125
the radio, you can see the 8 points coming

963
01:07:03,125 --> 01:07:08,999
out on the constellation there that encode the data.

964
01:07:09,125 --> 01:07:12,709
DRM is a cool digital mode for HF that sends

965
01:07:12,709 --> 01:07:17,083
near CD quality audio over HF and you can get incredible

966
01:07:17,083 --> 01:07:23,417
distances and have nice digital audio coming out on the other side.

967
01:07:25,834 --> 01:07:29,417
It's RFD M, this is a code that I put together

968
01:07:29,417 --> 01:07:34,999
from a paper and you can put obviously create pretty plots but looking

969
01:07:34,999 --> 01:07:37,999
at the peaks will tell you information

970
01:07:37,999 --> 01:07:43,209
about the OFDM parameters, so symbol direction is on.

971
01:07:43,459 --> 01:07:45,999
Then what's kinda cool is that it matches

972
01:07:45,999 --> 01:07:50,292
up with the class B encoding DRM because there are different classes,

973
01:07:50,292 --> 01:07:54,459
A through E I think that are used for protection classes depending

974
01:07:54,459 --> 01:07:58,834
on how far you want to send a signal or how good you want the quality

975
01:07:58,834 --> 01:08:02,999
of your audio to be so it's a good way of figuring things out Instead

976
01:08:02,999 --> 01:08:07,584
of writing that code though I realized I could write a simple flow graph

977
01:08:07,584 --> 01:08:11,417
and run the auto correlation, you see a peak coming out there,

978
01:08:11,417 --> 01:08:15,125
change the lag amount, remember there is a lag, you set that

979
01:08:15,125 --> 01:08:18,417
as the lag and you see these additional peaks coming

980
01:08:18,417 --> 01:08:20,999
out of the additional FFT and that matches

981
01:08:20,999 --> 01:08:26,501
up with the exact values that we got through the other way of doing it.

982
01:08:26,709 --> 01:08:28,292
That's sort of simple techniques you can use

983
01:08:28,292 --> 01:08:32,375
with Open Source software to figure out what an open signal it.

984
01:08:32,999 --> 01:08:34,999
Let's talk about Fast Track.

985
01:08:35,083 --> 01:08:39,083
I told you what it was already, during the preintroduction.

986
01:08:43,918 --> 01:08:48,876
But the interesting point is these tags do not actively

987
01:08:48,876 --> 01:08:50,999
transmit back.

988
01:08:51,209 --> 01:08:56,667
What happens is the tall radar will transmit an interrogation and it

989
01:08:56,667 --> 01:09:01,626
will keep a carrier, basically unmodulated carrier hitting

990
01:09:01,626 --> 01:09:06,209
the fast track tag and the microcontroller will change

991
01:09:06,209 --> 01:09:10,083
the load on the internal antenna.

992
01:09:10,083 --> 01:09:14,209
What that means is that the internal antenna will take

993
01:09:14,209 --> 01:09:19,501
a little bit of that energy, then when it modulates a 1, say,

994
01:09:19,501 --> 01:09:23,834
and then a 0, it won't actually absorb that energy

995
01:09:23,834 --> 01:09:29,667
and it will be reflected back to the original tag reader.

996
01:09:29,667 --> 01:09:33,167
So it's kinda weird that you have the situation where you might have

997
01:09:33,167 --> 01:09:36,999
these antennas, pointed down, and these are both transmitting

998
01:09:36,999 --> 01:09:41,167
and receiving at the same frequency at the same time.

999
01:09:41,167 --> 01:09:44,417
I had not actually played around with this before but it's neat

1000
01:09:44,417 --> 01:09:48,792
and it makes some things easier because you're using the single signal,

1001
01:09:48,792 --> 01:09:51,709
you don't have to worry about transmitting back,

1002
01:09:51,709 --> 01:09:54,250
it takes more power from the fast track tag

1003
01:09:54,250 --> 01:09:58,334
because these contain lithium batteries and you don't have to worry

1004
01:09:58,334 --> 01:10:01,999
about synchronization because you don't have two different

1005
01:10:01,999 --> 01:10:05,999
clocks that are running in different clock domains.

1006
01:10:05,999 --> 01:10:10,250
So apart from the antennas at the toll reading booth there are

1007
01:10:10,250 --> 01:10:15,083
antennas that sit on the highway that give useful traffic

1008
01:10:15,083 --> 01:10:20,999
information and I thought, well, I will go along and see what I pick

1009
01:10:20,999 --> 01:10:25,876
up so that's the antenna, and that is the spectrum coming

1010
01:10:25,876 --> 01:10:29,792
out on the laptop and that is the pulse coming

1011
01:10:29,792 --> 01:10:35,459
from the system so I recorded that and had a look at it.

1012
01:10:35,459 --> 01:10:40,042
This is actually on the side of the Golden Gate Bridge,

1013
01:10:40,042 --> 01:10:45,667
on the toll booths and I realized that I parked in, like,

1014
01:10:45,667 --> 01:10:52,167
the authority's reserve parking spot but I was very quick!

1015
01:10:52,167 --> 01:10:56,834
So I nest he willed myself in this bus stop and was pointing

1016
01:10:56,834 --> 01:11:01,083
at the top to see what I could find.

1017
01:11:01,375 --> 01:11:03,334
This is the trick, this is the really cool key that makes it

1018
01:11:03,334 --> 01:11:04,876
all happen.

1019
01:11:17,999 --> 01:11:21,667
It's this device here that I managed to find eBay, and this

1020
01:11:21,667 --> 01:11:25,083
will circulate around to a port and the transmit energy

1021
01:11:25,083 --> 01:11:29,083
from the interrogation transmitter would go to 1, then 2 and go

1022
01:11:29,083 --> 01:11:31,083
out the antenna.

1023
01:11:31,292 --> 01:11:35,125
Anything coming back up from the antenna will come

1024
01:11:35,125 --> 01:11:41,083
into and exit 3 and go to the receive side of your radio.

1025
01:11:42,375 --> 01:11:46,209
Coming anything coming from the receive side doesn't matter

1026
01:11:46,209 --> 01:11:50,584
because it won't be transmitting but this is my test set up there,

1027
01:11:50,584 --> 01:11:54,751
you have the circulate tore connected there and the tag leaning

1028
01:11:54,751 --> 01:11:58,083
up against leaning up against the cup.

1029
01:12:00,999 --> 01:12:05,083
This is the interrogation signal and looking at what's coming back

1030
01:12:05,083 --> 01:12:07,375
in from the antenna.

1031
01:12:14,250 --> 01:12:18,999
Circulators aren't perfect, if you don't have a matched antenna,

1032
01:12:18,999 --> 01:12:23,083
for example, but here on the left hand side there are lines

1033
01:12:23,083 --> 01:12:26,918
jumping up and down, this is the payload identifying

1034
01:12:26,918 --> 01:12:30,999
with an ID who the interrogator is and sure enough it uses

1035
01:12:30,999 --> 01:12:35,334
the exact same modulation, pulse modulation and then you have

1036
01:12:35,334 --> 01:12:40,542
a slightly wavy line emanating out, imagine that was flat.

1037
01:12:40,542 --> 01:12:45,292
This is the constant carrier that should be back modulated by the tag.

1038
01:12:48,999 --> 01:12:52,876
You can see if I flip between the lines there

1039
01:12:52,876 --> 01:12:57,876
is additional activity, weak but definitely something there

1040
01:12:57,876 --> 01:13:01,626
and then my tall tag has come up.

1041
01:13:01,626 --> 01:13:02,876
So that's the response.

1042
01:13:02,876 --> 01:13:06,834
If you use the good 'ol way back machine you can

1043
01:13:06,834 --> 01:13:11,999
find the department of transport's machine and this

1044
01:13:11,999 --> 01:13:18,999
is the preamble and when it detects a peak in the filter, meaning that

1045
01:13:18,999 --> 01:13:26,709
a back scanned modulated response is being sent by the tag it activates here

1046
01:13:26,709 --> 01:13:32,417
and once again we were talking about slashing the signal,

1047
01:13:32,417 --> 01:13:35,667
we're slicing the top.

1048
01:13:36,375 --> 01:13:40,999
1 is at the top, 0 at the bottom and binary out and we have

1049
01:13:40,999 --> 01:13:45,667
a payload that we can check for validity and then completely

1050
01:13:45,667 --> 01:13:49,125
unencrypted, you have the tag ID.

1051
01:13:49,834 --> 01:13:52,792
And the flow graph is relatively simple.

1052
01:13:52,792 --> 01:13:58,999
(Laughter.)    BALINT SEEBER: Okay I hit all the gruesome stuff but,

1053
01:13:58,999 --> 01:14:03,375
you know, I like big flow graphs.

1054
01:14:03,667 --> 01:14:07,459
You can do them hierarchal as well and I get crap

1055
01:14:07,459 --> 01:14:13,167
all the time that I should be using it but I never do.

1056
01:14:14,459 --> 01:14:19,083
I recommend Black Hat talk that was given I used quite a bit

1057
01:14:19,083 --> 01:14:24,999
of that talk that was given as an inspiration by Nate Wilson.

1058
01:14:25,999 --> 01:14:29,999
Okay let's cover direction finding quickly.

1059
01:14:30,083 --> 01:14:35,250
Up to now we have been talking about the contents of signals, trying

1060
01:14:35,250 --> 01:14:38,667
to figure out what's inside.

1061
01:14:38,667 --> 01:14:40,542
This is more about where they're coming from,

1062
01:14:40,542 --> 01:14:44,334
which can be used as a bit of a key as to what's going o where

1063
01:14:44,334 --> 01:14:46,083
somebody is.

1064
01:14:46,083 --> 01:14:52,999
It was originally radio navigation, radar, it can be emergency intelligence,

1065
01:14:52,999 --> 01:14:58,667
trying to find someone that might be lost and it was used

1066
01:14:58,667 --> 01:15:04,292
in World War 1 World War II, along the British coast line,

1067
01:15:04,292 --> 01:15:09,417
they were trying to find U Boats and apart from sort

1068
01:15:09,417 --> 01:15:15,417
of VHF and UHF signals you could have incredibly large arrays

1069
01:15:15,417 --> 01:15:21,417
like the ones here in Germany, those are cars that are parked

1070
01:15:21,417 --> 01:15:26,667
in the parking lot at the bottom of the image so that

1071
01:15:26,667 --> 01:15:33,083
is a huge installation, and this is used to pinpoint transmissions

1072
01:15:33,083 --> 01:15:39,250
from all over the globe that are transmitted on HF or long wave

1073
01:15:39,250 --> 01:15:41,999
around the globe.

1074
01:15:43,918 --> 01:15:46,667
Now you have the fox hunt where the transmitters are hidden

1075
01:15:46,667 --> 01:15:49,999
in the forest, and they have to try and find it.

1076
01:15:50,083 --> 01:15:53,667
It's a high directional antenna, so you can pinpoint where the signal

1077
01:15:53,667 --> 01:15:57,542
is coming from, and that's a crazy, serious, German ham!

1078
01:15:59,834 --> 01:16:03,667
(Laughter.) The first thing I played around with was pseudo Doppler

1079
01:16:03,667 --> 01:16:07,292
direction finding, and idea is you use a Doppler affect to cause

1080
01:16:07,292 --> 01:16:10,167
in the radio wave, and then exploit that to figure

1081
01:16:10,167 --> 01:16:13,918
out where the signal is actually coming from.

1082
01:16:13,999 --> 01:16:15,999
So I'm showing the Doppler affect.

1083
01:16:16,167 --> 01:16:18,959
As you move an object this changes the waves.

1084
01:16:19,125 --> 01:16:21,876
What you can do is have, and you can see my highly

1085
01:16:21,876 --> 01:16:26,999
and technical refined wave passing through the center of the circle.

1086
01:16:26,999 --> 01:16:33,334
The vertical line there on the circumference is the antenna.

1087
01:16:34,959 --> 01:16:38,999
So the idea is you rotate the antenna through the wave, there

1088
01:16:38,999 --> 01:16:43,417
by compress it go in frequency and as you come out the other way,

1089
01:16:43,417 --> 01:16:48,083
through D back to A it's moving the opposite direction and you expand

1090
01:16:48,083 --> 01:16:51,792
the wave and you end up with a Doppler shift and that

1091
01:16:51,792 --> 01:16:56,083
will change the frequency slightly of your signal.

1092
01:16:56,876 --> 01:17:00,667
The cool thing about it is FM, frequency modulation relies

1093
01:17:00,667 --> 01:17:02,459
on this fact.

1094
01:17:02,459 --> 01:17:05,501
It will change your carrier wave in frequency, depending

1095
01:17:05,501 --> 01:17:07,667
upon the signal.

1096
01:17:07,667 --> 01:17:09,999
So what you're doing is adding an extra tone, adding

1097
01:17:09,999 --> 01:17:12,125
a bit of modulation.

1098
01:17:12,334 --> 01:17:17,417
So this works well with ham signals and it means that you can use any old

1099
01:17:17,417 --> 01:17:22,250
FM radio or SDR to do determination of a direction.

1100
01:17:22,459 --> 01:17:24,250
So the problem is that once you take everything

1101
01:17:24,250 --> 01:17:26,250
into account, here we have microtuitous,

1102
01:17:26,250 --> 01:17:28,250
signal transduciton.

1103
01:17:29,876 --> 01:17:33,167
You would have to do it at a fast rate that would be

1104
01:17:33,167 --> 01:17:35,709
physically impossible.

1105
01:17:35,999 --> 01:17:38,542
(Laughter.) So what do you do instead?

1106
01:17:38,999 --> 01:17:42,834
Electronically you have a fixed array that don't move

1107
01:17:42,834 --> 01:17:46,083
but switch in between them electronically using

1108
01:17:46,083 --> 01:17:48,501
an antenna switch.

1109
01:17:48,501 --> 01:17:50,501
What it means is instead of having continuous motion

1110
01:17:50,501 --> 01:17:53,999
you do those secret steps and end up with the same response

1111
01:17:53,999 --> 01:17:58,626
and you can filter that a little bit to end up with the motion.

1112
01:17:59,083 --> 01:18:02,792
This is your classic, homemade IDF.

1113
01:18:02,792 --> 01:18:05,667
It's a box you would hook up to an FM receiver and

1114
01:18:05,667 --> 01:18:08,292
the LEDs would indicate the direction

1115
01:18:08,292 --> 01:18:11,292
the transmission was coming from and this

1116
01:18:11,292 --> 01:18:15,584
is the internal component or system diagram.

1117
01:18:15,999 --> 01:18:19,167
The stuff in green is all clocked together which means

1118
01:18:19,167 --> 01:18:24,292
that it's synchronous and it means that certain frequencies are introduced

1119
01:18:24,292 --> 01:18:28,626
into this signal and you need to focus in on the one to figure

1120
01:18:28,626 --> 01:18:30,918
out the direction.

1121
01:18:30,999 --> 01:18:33,459
This is the circuit diagram for reference and you're going

1122
01:18:33,459 --> 01:18:35,876
to look like maybe a little bit weird driving

1123
01:18:35,876 --> 01:18:38,751
around with all of this stuff hanging out of your roof,

1124
01:18:38,751 --> 01:18:41,459
but hey that's exactly what I did!

1125
01:18:41,459 --> 01:18:46,792
(Laughter.) I went color, I got an SDR, and I used mapping software

1126
01:18:46,792 --> 01:18:53,542
and I got the Dopplermobile happening, so I made an antenna there.

1127
01:18:53,667 --> 01:18:57,959
If you recall this diagram, all that is done in software and all that

1128
01:18:57,959 --> 01:19:01,959
is what remains after doing all this in software.

1129
01:19:01,999 --> 01:19:06,751
So this is what you use to transport windows with, I cutout

1130
01:19:06,751 --> 01:19:12,250
the tin, put elements on top, put it into an antenna switch that I got

1131
01:19:12,250 --> 01:19:15,292
as a free sample of from an RF company

1132
01:19:15,292 --> 01:19:19,459
and ran it through so the clock that was controlling

1133
01:19:19,459 --> 01:19:23,083
the SDR was controlling the antenna switch and

1134
01:19:23,083 --> 01:19:27,167
the beauty about that is the frequency that you get

1135
01:19:27,167 --> 01:19:31,999
out that reaches the computer is synced to the rate at which

1136
01:19:31,999 --> 01:19:37,834
the antennas are rotating so you can narrow in on one that is guaranteed

1137
01:19:37,834 --> 01:19:42,459
to be the signal of interest, the Doppler tone that you can

1138
01:19:42,459 --> 01:19:47,250
determine the phase from to determine direction.

1139
01:19:48,751 --> 01:19:53,250
This is the receiver, I had two laptops in the car, one doing the tracking,

1140
01:19:53,250 --> 01:19:57,834
one doing the mapping, flow graph, I won't go into details but you've got

1141
01:19:57,834 --> 01:20:01,375
the source coming in, you generate your reference sign wave

1142
01:20:01,375 --> 01:20:05,584
and the Doppler tone you extract from your incoming RF and the trick

1143
01:20:05,584 --> 01:20:09,334
is that you compare the phase between your reference sign wave

1144
01:20:09,334 --> 01:20:12,999
and the sign wave that comes in from the Doppler signal and

1145
01:20:12,999 --> 01:20:15,999
the difference between those phases will give you

1146
01:20:15,999 --> 01:20:19,250
the direction of your signal, that's the trick so it's

1147
01:20:19,250 --> 01:20:22,999
a phase comparison with a known reference.

1148
01:20:22,999 --> 01:20:26,083
So if you look at the FFT of your incoming signaling you see how

1149
01:20:26,083 --> 01:20:28,375
you have the peak there?

1150
01:20:28,375 --> 01:20:29,667
That's the Doppler tone.

1151
01:20:29,999 --> 01:20:33,125
So you take a reference, which might be the blue one and

1152
01:20:33,125 --> 01:20:35,999
the green one is the Doppler tone that you've been

1153
01:20:35,999 --> 01:20:39,876
able to filter out and determine the phase there and that literally

1154
01:20:39,876 --> 01:20:43,250
is your direction of arrival of your signal.

1155
01:20:43,834 --> 01:20:48,999
So I thought we would test it, we picked a big tower, drive around,

1156
01:20:48,999 --> 01:20:53,167
X marks the spot for reference and every time I drive

1157
01:20:53,167 --> 01:20:56,250
around and stop and take a measurement,

1158
01:20:56,250 --> 01:21:01,751
after a while it ends up roughly matching up on the red.

1159
01:21:01,751 --> 01:21:04,083
The thing is you have to be careful because RF

1160
01:21:04,083 --> 01:21:07,417
is black magic through and through.

1161
01:21:07,542 --> 01:21:10,876
The area highlighted in green was actually when I was

1162
01:21:10,876 --> 01:21:14,542
coming down from a hill into sort of a lower portion

1163
01:21:14,542 --> 01:21:17,999
before another hill and the RF waves would bounce

1164
01:21:17,999 --> 01:21:22,542
off the back of the hill behind me and creep up sneakily on top

1165
01:21:22,542 --> 01:21:26,999
of my array on top of the car so the direction was behind me,

1166
01:21:26,999 --> 01:21:31,999
because that's where the main wave front was coming from.

1167
01:21:31,999 --> 01:21:34,584
As soon as I came over the next hill, I ended up having

1168
01:21:34,584 --> 01:21:37,999
the direction coming from directly in front of me which was

1169
01:21:37,999 --> 01:21:40,999
the correct one because there were no obstructions so

1170
01:21:40,999 --> 01:21:43,834
reflexes are important to deal with and to filter

1171
01:21:43,834 --> 01:21:46,250
out from your measurements.

1172
01:21:46,667 --> 01:21:50,209
So I repeated it again, this time in Mountain View,

1173
01:21:50,209 --> 01:21:53,626
that's where work formerly was and you may know

1174
01:21:53,626 --> 01:21:57,999
of a big company based there and they have cars with all sorts

1175
01:21:57,999 --> 01:22:01,999
of stuff attached to their roof so I thought I would pay

1176
01:22:01,999 --> 01:22:05,375
them with a visit with a car with stuff attached

1177
01:22:05,375 --> 01:22:09,999
to its roof (Laughter.) So I went through a drive down Shoreline,

1178
01:22:09,999 --> 01:22:13,792
through Google to trying to pinpoint this particular

1179
01:22:13,792 --> 01:22:15,999
radio transmission.

1180
01:22:16,083 --> 01:22:18,167
That's the Doppler approach.

1181
01:22:18,167 --> 01:22:20,542
It has drawbacks, it's okay.

1182
01:22:21,083 --> 01:22:24,999
But you can use the four antennas again and

1183
01:22:24,999 --> 01:22:30,918
instead of doing this phase comparison you can get down and dirty

1184
01:22:30,918 --> 01:22:35,083
with math and the one of the popular algorithms,

1185
01:22:35,083 --> 01:22:41,209
and you use a modal and you have an array manifold which models your

1186
01:22:41,209 --> 01:22:47,375
antenna set up and the peaks will give you the direction of arrival,

1187
01:22:47,375 --> 01:22:52,417
so you can imagine those points there on the X axis, and

1188
01:22:52,417 --> 01:22:57,709
as your wave front comes in they will all hit each antenna

1189
01:22:57,709 --> 01:23:03,542
at a slightly different point in time, and then you can determine

1190
01:23:03,542 --> 01:23:07,125
the phase difference between the signals,

1191
01:23:07,125 --> 01:23:11,999
and you can durf I didn't say durf, did I?

1192
01:23:12,626 --> 01:23:13,999
(Laughing).

1193
01:23:14,584 --> 01:23:18,792
Maybe I've been talking too long, you can determine what?

1194
01:23:20,250 --> 01:23:21,999
This is pretty good!

1195
01:23:21,999 --> 01:23:23,167
(Laughter.)    Thanks.

1196
01:23:23,167 --> 01:23:28,999
(Laughter.)    BALINT SEEBER: You're welcome.

1197
01:23:29,083 --> 01:23:32,876
So this is finding that array response.

1198
01:23:33,083 --> 01:23:36,709
Here I think I had just four antennas in a row, you tell

1199
01:23:36,709 --> 01:23:41,999
the model that you have four antennas in a row, you express it as a matrix

1200
01:23:41,999 --> 01:23:45,751
and it will go through 360 degrees and simulate what

1201
01:23:45,751 --> 01:23:48,918
the array response would be and when you get

1202
01:23:48,918 --> 01:23:51,999
the incoming signal you run that through each

1203
01:23:51,999 --> 01:23:57,083
of the particular degrees and that goes from 0 to 360 across the bottom

1204
01:23:57,083 --> 01:24:01,125
and you have the peak that matches the array response and

1205
01:24:01,125 --> 01:24:04,125
the advantage is you get higher resolution

1206
01:24:04,125 --> 01:24:08,501
but you need as many radios as antenna is now.

1207
01:24:10,667 --> 01:24:14,918
This is sort of a higher end SDR that research has

1208
01:24:14,918 --> 01:24:18,999
that is called a quad radio but I had fun with it,

1209
01:24:18,999 --> 01:24:24,542
you get those missile launchings, and the idea is it acquires you

1210
01:24:24,542 --> 01:24:32,083
and locks on so if you look closely, I move the radio around it will track it.

1211
01:24:37,334 --> 01:24:39,334
(Laughter.) Wait for it!

1212
01:24:45,626 --> 01:24:46,417
I said "fire!"

1213
01:24:46,417 --> 01:24:50,417
But there was no audio, maybe it was turned down.

1214
01:24:50,417 --> 01:24:53,667
I said "fire" and when it detects that it shoots you!

1215
01:24:55,083 --> 01:24:59,083
(Laughter.) So I set it up there again.

1216
01:24:59,209 --> 01:25:03,083
This is not the cheapest SDR but I checked in the boot

1217
01:25:03,083 --> 01:25:07,375
with a big SLA battery to keep it powered while I was driving

1218
01:25:07,375 --> 01:25:11,250
around so here just to    Testing    BALINT SEEBER: You

1219
01:25:11,250 --> 01:25:16,999
can see as I walk around the car the compass traction my movement.

1220
01:25:17,125 --> 01:25:19,876
Testing, testing.

1221
01:25:19,999 --> 01:25:24,999
BALINT SEEBER: So if I go for a little drive here,

1222
01:25:24,999 --> 01:25:31,999
then once again I have repeated that route through Google's campus

1223
01:25:31,999 --> 01:25:39,999
but I picked some other frequency and I guess it's keeping good track of it,

1224
01:25:39,999 --> 01:25:46,999
except for the down below, but it will reflect that just as it would

1225
01:25:46,999 --> 01:25:52,501
from the primary direction and this is the radio and

1226
01:25:52,501 --> 01:25:57,542
if you have another set up you might connect two

1227
01:25:57,542 --> 01:26:01,918
of these together with a single reference

1228
01:26:01,918 --> 01:26:07,167
and you can create the same sort of thing.

1229
01:26:07,626 --> 01:26:12,209
All right, if you're going to be driving around like this, have

1230
01:26:12,209 --> 01:26:17,209
an amateur radio license, I had antenna structural redundancy

1231
01:26:17,209 --> 01:26:22,167
that I had a string, I can't drive more than 40 miles an hour

1232
01:26:22,167 --> 01:26:27,083
because I get serious vibrations and it's scary.

1233
01:26:27,334 --> 01:26:29,999
It's good to be clean shaven, I guess!

1234
01:26:30,417 --> 01:26:35,375
And if you have any radios that are used by the police like the Motorola,

1235
01:26:35,375 --> 01:26:38,999
it's good to hide them because unfortunately or some

1236
01:26:38,999 --> 01:26:43,125
of them don't know they can be used as legitimate ham radios so

1237
01:26:43,125 --> 01:26:48,209
they get suspicious when they see what are you listening to?

1238
01:26:48,209 --> 01:26:49,209
The cops?

1239
01:26:49,667 --> 01:26:50,667
What's going on?

1240
01:26:50,667 --> 01:26:55,083
And because I had the wires coming in through the window I couldn't open

1241
01:26:55,083 --> 01:26:59,584
the door so you have to turn around and disconnect the wires

1242
01:26:59,584 --> 01:27:02,751
in the back, take it from me!

1243
01:27:03,209 --> 01:27:06,125
(Laughter.) So more security stuff.

1244
01:27:06,125 --> 01:27:09,167
Do not try this wherever you are.

1245
01:27:09,167 --> 01:27:12,834
So pagers, like a doctor, I will read the first bit, and the you can read

1246
01:27:12,834 --> 01:27:14,501
the next bit.

1247
01:27:16,375 --> 01:27:19,709
Is your arch nemeses in the hospital?

1248
01:27:19,709 --> 01:27:23,167
"(Laughter.)" Need to distract security?

1249
01:27:23,167 --> 01:27:27,792
"All these were sent out I can't quite remember now

1250
01:27:27,792 --> 01:27:33,959
but it had to do with rotation of guards or shift changes.

1251
01:27:33,999 --> 01:27:39,584
So in Mode S" Do you want to reach cruising altitude quicker?

1252
01:27:39,584 --> 01:27:45,999
"(Laughter.) So as I said, all these things, they're all unencrypted,

1253
01:27:45,999 --> 01:27:50,834
it's illegal to transmit but the protocols are there,

1254
01:27:50,834 --> 01:27:56,334
and you can implement it with these sorts of ols."

1255
01:27:56,334 --> 01:28:01,292
Do you think the pilot made the wrong choice in deciding to land?

1256
01:28:01,292 --> 01:28:05,667
"(Laughter.)" Did you want to display a message

1257
01:28:05,667 --> 01:28:08,083
on everyone's radar screen?

1258
01:28:08,083 --> 01:28:11,876
"You know there is ASCII art.

1259
01:28:11,876 --> 01:28:12,667
If you send out enough transponders

1260
01:28:12,667 --> 01:28:14,584
with different IDs, then you could probably

1261
01:28:14,584 --> 01:28:16,250
spell something.

1262
01:28:18,459 --> 01:28:22,584
This is the aid car now, So this is the text messaging from the aircraft."

1263
01:28:22,584 --> 01:28:24,834
Do you not want to fly on a particular aircraft?

1264
01:28:24,834 --> 01:28:28,167
"These things are automatically sent.

1265
01:28:28,459 --> 01:28:34,667
They are incredibly complex and thorough in their self checks.

1266
01:28:34,751 --> 01:28:38,834
It's interesting to see the reports they send."

1267
01:28:38,834 --> 01:28:45,999
Was the flight you were on a little bumpy?

1268
01:28:45,999 --> 01:28:47,083
"

1269
01:28:47,083 --> 01:28:51,999
Do you want to message the cockpit privately?"

1270
01:28:51,999 --> 01:29:00,999
There are 4 assigned labels that address the cockpit printers.

1271
01:29:00,999 --> 01:29:05,334
I doubt they print anymore but the message might be set.

1272
01:29:10,709 --> 01:29:13,709
The uplink power control controls the amount of power sent

1273
01:29:13,709 --> 01:29:15,709
up by the ground, and it's usually kept

1274
01:29:15,709 --> 01:29:18,667
at a minimum because it's very costly.

1275
01:29:26,209 --> 01:29:28,792
Depends on the weather, as we established.

1276
01:29:29,083 --> 01:29:31,999
Heavy rain, costs more.

1277
01:29:33,999 --> 01:29:41,125
You can turn your signal a little bit higher than yours

1278
01:29:41,125 --> 01:29:48,999
and it actually says a malfunctioning uplink control system

1279
01:29:48,999 --> 01:29:54,999
can damage a satellite wave amplifier.

1280
01:29:56,999 --> 01:30:01,125
This is the signal from earth and sends it back down.

1281
01:30:01,459 --> 01:30:06,542
If you end up sending a higher signal than what it can take,

1282
01:30:06,542 --> 01:30:08,959
it could bust.

1283
01:30:11,501 --> 01:30:15,209
You can hot wire a complete transponder.

1284
01:30:19,626 --> 01:30:23,999
But you need serious equipment to dot hat.

1285
01:30:23,999 --> 01:30:26,999
FastTrak, you don't want to pay another toll in your life ...

1286
01:30:40,999 --> 01:30:43,999
You want traffic management to think there is some kind

1287
01:30:43,999 --> 01:30:45,999
of issue happening.

1288
01:30:47,542 --> 01:30:50,167
You could just stand there.

1289
01:30:50,167 --> 01:30:55,999
Do you want to keep tabs on someone?

1290
01:30:56,918 --> 01:31:02,918
Set up a reader and see if they drive past.

1291
01:31:03,626 --> 01:31:09,459
You drive up the highway, and you can be read.

1292
01:31:47,834 --> 01:31:49,999
You can get an amateur radio licenses

1293
01:31:49,999 --> 01:31:54,959
and do experimental stuff there but elsewhere it's not a good idea.

1294
01:31:56,751 --> 01:31:58,459
Thank you very much.

1295
01:32:09,876 --> 01:32:14,501
(Applause.) If you would like to know more information,

1296
01:32:14,501 --> 01:32:20,626
I put a lot of stuff on my Wiki, my main web site, documents, projects,

1297
01:32:20,626 --> 01:32:25,709
a lot of the things like direction finding and stuff I keep

1298
01:32:25,709 --> 01:32:30,999
on my GitHub, and if you want to email me, there are my e mails

1299
01:32:30,999 --> 01:32:33,751
and Twitter handle.

1300
01:32:34,083 --> 01:32:41,417
AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Away from mic.)    BALINT SEEBER: I sent

1301
01:32:41,417 --> 01:32:45,375
a huge deck to DEF CON.

1302
01:32:50,125 --> 01:32:53,501
The deck that I showed you today has been significantly upgraded

1303
01:32:53,501 --> 01:32:58,083
but in time I'll post those as well as the videos and things like that.

1304
01:32:58,584 --> 01:33:00,083
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Thank you.

1305
01:33:00,083 --> 01:33:01,501
BALINT SEEBER: If you have questions come and find me

1306
01:33:01,501 --> 01:33:03,083
and talk to me.
