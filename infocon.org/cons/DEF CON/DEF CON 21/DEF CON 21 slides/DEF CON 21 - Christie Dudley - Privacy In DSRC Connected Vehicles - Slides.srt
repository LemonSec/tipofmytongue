1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,667
CHRISTIE DUDLEY: Okay.

2
00:00:01,918 --> 00:00:02,999
Good afternoon.

3
00:00:02,999 --> 00:00:04,542
I like to say, good morning.

4
00:00:04,876 --> 00:00:10,667
Welcome, I'm here to talk about privacy in connected vehicles.

5
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:16,209
First of all, a little bit about who I am.

6
00:00:16,209 --> 00:00:18,999
I have an electrical engineering degree.

7
00:00:19,167 --> 00:00:22,999
And I decided that work as a network engineer -- I decided that

8
00:00:22,999 --> 00:00:26,709
got boring, so I went to law school because that's where

9
00:00:26,709 --> 00:00:30,292
all the really interesting problems lie.

10
00:00:31,292 --> 00:00:34,334
The standard disclaimer: I'm not a lawyer.

11
00:00:34,334 --> 00:00:36,626
I don't give legal advice yet.

12
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:41,000
But here is my nonstandard disclaimer.

13
00:00:41,292 --> 00:00:44,999
I was contracted to work on this and I did sign an NDA in relation

14
00:00:44,999 --> 00:00:46,876
to that work.

15
00:00:46,876 --> 00:00:51,959
However, that was only about 20 hours of work total.

16
00:00:51,959 --> 00:00:57,751
So there's not a lot of that to not disclose.

17
00:00:58,167 --> 00:00:59,751
Okay.

18
00:00:59,792 --> 00:01:00,999
This project.

19
00:01:01,626 --> 00:01:04,542
Dedicated short range communications.

20
00:01:04,999 --> 00:01:09,999
A lot of people should know what this is by now, but it's, unfortunately,

21
00:01:09,999 --> 00:01:12,250
still pretty opaque.

22
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:16,501
The senate committee Subcommittee on Communications Technology

23
00:01:16,501 --> 00:01:21,459
and the Internet sure is aware of it and they're really excited

24
00:01:21,459 --> 00:01:24,667
about this being the panacea that solves

25
00:01:24,667 --> 00:01:29,709
the wireless spectrum problem that they anticipate.

26
00:01:29,709 --> 00:01:31,584
It's a multichannel protocol.

27
00:01:31,584 --> 00:01:34,709
I'm going to be focusing on one channel, which

28
00:01:34,709 --> 00:01:38,959
is for dedicated safety communications.

29
00:01:40,334 --> 00:01:44,083
The idea is that vehicles communicate to other vehicles and

30
00:01:44,083 --> 00:01:47,999
they also communicate with the infrastructure.

31
00:01:47,999 --> 00:01:51,501
It would be pretty nice if 380 meters out they detected you were

32
00:01:51,501 --> 00:01:56,584
approaching a red light in the middle of the night and so you never ever had

33
00:01:56,584 --> 00:01:58,999
to stop because there was never any

34
00:01:58,999 --> 00:02:00,918
cross traffic.

35
00:02:00,918 --> 00:02:06,709
The idea of infrastructure efficiency is pretty cool.

36
00:02:06,999 --> 00:02:09,959
My question will it maintain privacy?

37
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:15,999
I am not convinced that the system as described

38
00:02:15,999 --> 00:02:21,999
will have enough protections for personal privacy.

39
00:02:21,999 --> 00:02:25,584
I think it can, but I think it needs some very serious

40
00:02:25,584 --> 00:02:29,542
people taking a very serious look at.

41
00:02:31,334 --> 00:02:34,292
There have been a few reviews, like my review.

42
00:02:34,292 --> 00:02:39,334
It was a very small project, and not a lot that's really convinced

43
00:02:39,334 --> 00:02:45,083
the auto makers who are charging forward that they need to slow

44
00:02:45,083 --> 00:02:51,501
down and consider the implications that this has on people.

45
00:02:54,083 --> 00:02:58,999
The real reason that this technology is being pushed forward is safety.

46
00:02:58,999 --> 00:03:05,876
And it's really dramatic the kind of safety expectations.

47
00:03:05,876 --> 00:03:10,292
They just finished a large scale road test and the kind

48
00:03:10,292 --> 00:03:14,792
of improvements they expect to get.

49
00:03:14,792 --> 00:03:19,918
They're expecting an 82% reduction in all automobile accidents.

50
00:03:19,918 --> 00:03:20,918
82%.

51
00:03:20,999 --> 00:03:23,999
That's a really dramatic number.

52
00:03:24,125 --> 00:03:28,334
It's revolutionizing driving.

53
00:03:30,834 --> 00:03:35,667
For example, in 2009 there were 5,000 deaths just

54
00:03:35,667 --> 00:03:39,626
from distracted driving alone.

55
00:03:39,626 --> 00:03:41,459
That doesn't include drunk driving.

56
00:03:41,459 --> 00:03:44,959
It doesn't include inattentive or emotionally distraught driving,

57
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:48,999
which also causes a large number of accidents.

58
00:03:49,334 --> 00:03:52,709
5,000 deaths in 2009 that were totally preventable,

59
00:03:52,709 --> 00:03:57,999
this system would completely eliminate that type or virtually eliminate that type

60
00:03:57,999 --> 00:03:59,751
of accident.

61
00:04:02,751 --> 00:04:07,792
There are a lot of people who are working

62
00:04:07,792 --> 00:04:11,584
on this safety project.

63
00:04:16,999 --> 00:04:22,459
As I mentioned before, totally nontrivial effect on death.

64
00:04:23,083 --> 00:04:29,334
25% of vehicle deaths each year can be prevented even without the system.

65
00:04:29,542 --> 00:04:34,125
With the system we're going to beyond what we're talking

66
00:04:34,125 --> 00:04:39,167
about blind corners, dense fog, heavy rain, situations

67
00:04:39,167 --> 00:04:45,751
the National Institute the NTSB, National Transportation Safety Board,

68
00:04:45,751 --> 00:04:51,999
the wonderful people that brought us TSA, they have recently called

69
00:04:51,999 --> 00:04:56,459
for a mandate because of two school bus accidents

70
00:04:56,459 --> 00:04:59,083
in the last month.

71
00:04:59,999 --> 00:05:06,292
The buses were one of them the bus driver was at fault.

72
00:05:06,292 --> 00:05:10,334
He was on medication and he wasn't reacting as he should and

73
00:05:10,334 --> 00:05:14,999
he ran a red light and the bus got hit by a truck moving

74
00:05:14,999 --> 00:05:18,083
through the intersection.

75
00:05:18,083 --> 00:05:20,999
And the other instance was the school bus was moving safely

76
00:05:20,999 --> 00:05:23,999
and there was a speeding truck that couldn't slow

77
00:05:23,999 --> 00:05:27,667
down in time to avoid hitting the school bus.

78
00:05:27,667 --> 00:05:30,751
Two school buses, many school children died.

79
00:05:30,876 --> 00:05:35,125
Each of these different scenarios could have been prevented had

80
00:05:35,125 --> 00:05:40,334
the driver been warned that there was an imminent accident.

81
00:05:40,334 --> 00:05:43,626
And with 380 meters communication range, that's the spec

82
00:05:43,626 --> 00:05:46,459
for the communication range.

83
00:05:46,459 --> 00:05:49,792
It has the potential to extend out much further.

84
00:05:49,792 --> 00:05:52,083
So that's a lot of warning.

85
00:05:52,083 --> 00:05:58,999
That's a lot of ability to respond in an accident.

86
00:05:58,999 --> 00:06:02,999
Then the next question that comes up is this going to really happen?

87
00:06:02,999 --> 00:06:05,999
And the answer is yeah.

88
00:06:05,999 --> 00:06:07,626
It's already out there.

89
00:06:07,751 --> 00:06:12,751
Most auto makers have plans most high end auto makers have plans

90
00:06:12,751 --> 00:06:17,667
to include this in their 2014 model year cars.

91
00:06:18,083 --> 00:06:21,125
The NTSB is talking about making a mandate

92
00:06:21,125 --> 00:06:24,999
for 2015 model year cars, meaning every car

93
00:06:24,999 --> 00:06:29,709
on the road starting in 2015 will have this.

94
00:06:29,834 --> 00:06:32,584
ACDELCO is looking at aftermarket products,

95
00:06:32,584 --> 00:06:36,918
perhaps saving you a little money on your insurance and bring more

96
00:06:36,918 --> 00:06:39,083
money into the fold.

97
00:06:39,834 --> 00:06:41,999
And then, how soon?

98
00:06:42,209 --> 00:06:44,125
2014/2015.

99
00:06:44,125 --> 00:06:45,792
Very soon.

100
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:49,999
They've already run large scale tests.

101
00:06:50,209 --> 00:06:55,083
In Ann Arbor, Michigan, they got all the employees of the university

102
00:06:55,083 --> 00:06:59,375
and the hospital to put the aftermarket version in their car

103
00:06:59,375 --> 00:07:03,209
and they ran around for a year, and they measured what

104
00:07:03,209 --> 00:07:07,999
the density implications were, how it dealt with the infrastructure

105
00:07:07,999 --> 00:07:11,584
and how cars dealt with each other.

106
00:07:11,792 --> 00:07:13,375
They learned a lot of lessons.

107
00:07:13,375 --> 00:07:17,209
They came out with a new version and they believe they're ready

108
00:07:17,209 --> 00:07:20,209
to move forward with this.

109
00:07:20,999 --> 00:07:24,999
This sort of technology is already deployed in Europe.

110
00:07:24,999 --> 00:07:29,083
In addition to the safety benefits, you're able to get more efficiency

111
00:07:29,083 --> 00:07:31,999
by allowing cars to move closer together,

112
00:07:31,999 --> 00:07:36,167
because as soon as somebody in front of you steps on the brake,

113
00:07:36,167 --> 00:07:40,125
you know that so you can step on the brake.

114
00:07:40,125 --> 00:07:45,542
If you're particularly alert, so you can get efficiencies, as well

115
00:07:45,542 --> 00:07:48,751
as density efficiencies.

116
00:07:50,999 --> 00:07:52,999
What is this?

117
00:07:54,292 --> 00:07:58,709
The basic safety message is part of the protocol.

118
00:07:59,083 --> 00:08:07,876
It's a digital blob that's sent out once every 10th of a second.

119
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:13,792
It's a standard blog with predefined.

120
00:08:18,167 --> 00:08:20,999
There's no header information.

121
00:08:20,999 --> 00:08:25,709
It's for the like ASN 1 where you have the key value pairs.

122
00:08:25,709 --> 00:08:27,167
It's just the data glob.

123
00:08:28,751 --> 00:08:33,584
The idea is that the cars process the messages and warn

124
00:08:33,584 --> 00:08:39,999
the driver so that the driver isn't the driver actually gets to mitigate

125
00:08:39,999 --> 00:08:45,999
the information and interpret it as to what they should do initially,

126
00:08:45,999 --> 00:08:53,959
although the self driving car people are really excited about this technology.

127
00:08:56,083 --> 00:08:59,999
They assured me that this wasn't an autonomous thing and

128
00:08:59,999 --> 00:09:02,918
they would see that it works a few years

129
00:09:02,918 --> 00:09:06,834
before they started automating the system.

130
00:09:08,999 --> 00:09:12,792
This is what the aftermarket system looks like.

131
00:09:13,667 --> 00:09:16,959
The idea is it comes with its own sensors.

132
00:09:17,999 --> 00:09:24,751
It was told to me that it would be a self contained system.

133
00:09:24,876 --> 00:09:27,959
There would be no existing.

134
00:09:36,334 --> 00:09:39,834
They were confident they had developed

135
00:09:39,834 --> 00:09:45,876
the sensor systems well enough that they wouldn't have the concerns

136
00:09:45,876 --> 00:09:51,626
about coming between the sensor and the control unit.

137
00:09:51,876 --> 00:09:57,999
I'm not sure that's necessarily true, but they feel that by moving away

138
00:09:57,999 --> 00:10:02,250
from the architect and into this sealed system,

139
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:08,999
they could avoid a lot of the vulnerabilities that exist now.

140
00:10:09,918 --> 00:10:16,999
So DSRC is not canned bus.

141
00:10:16,999 --> 00:10:19,999
It's not the same technology at all.

142
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,417
This is a radio that communicates with other vehicles.

143
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:32,959
It has its own inertia sensors, GPS systems, as well as other systems.

144
00:10:33,292 --> 00:10:38,999
They're very well aware with large cities with tall buildings

145
00:10:38,999 --> 00:10:45,250
as well as in tunnels and canyons, it's sometimes very difficult

146
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:48,999
to determine GPS location.

147
00:10:48,999 --> 00:10:51,876
So they need to have alternative ways.

148
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,999
They're working through that as well.

149
00:10:54,167 --> 00:10:55,918
It is not OnStar.

150
00:10:56,042 --> 00:11:00,667
I've spoken with a lot of people how is this different from OnStar?

151
00:11:00,667 --> 00:11:02,083
This is a vehicle to vehicle.

152
00:11:02,709 --> 00:11:07,999
All auto manufacturers would be running the same protocol.

153
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:12,501
And as I mentioned before, they're talking about mandate.

154
00:11:12,999 --> 00:11:16,999
So this isn't a phone home situation.

155
00:11:16,999 --> 00:11:19,999
This is a notify everybody in the vicinity.

156
00:11:21,918 --> 00:11:23,250
Okay.

157
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:24,792
More technical details.

158
00:11:24,792 --> 00:11:28,501
5.9 gigahertz spectrum.

159
00:11:29,542 --> 00:11:32,999
The GOP owns the spectrum.

160
00:11:39,999 --> 00:11:47,834
Only one of the channels will be used for safety messages.

161
00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:58,626
Theoretically this does not require for the safety information

162
00:11:58,626 --> 00:12:01,626
source address.

163
00:12:02,834 --> 00:12:07,751
The source address was removed from the protocol in 2010

164
00:12:07,751 --> 00:12:11,542
because of the privacy concerns.

165
00:12:11,542 --> 00:12:13,999
Anytime you have a uniquely identified vehicle,

166
00:12:13,999 --> 00:12:17,334
you have a uniquely identified vehicle.

167
00:12:17,375 --> 00:12:20,417
And you have the problem of tracking.

168
00:12:20,709 --> 00:12:23,709
So they removed that from the protocol.

169
00:12:23,709 --> 00:12:27,501
However, if you think about it, how do you route

170
00:12:27,501 --> 00:12:32,125
without a uniquely identifiable address?

171
00:12:32,125 --> 00:12:33,918
How do you validate people?

172
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:39,999
They came up with the idea of certificates where you have

173
00:12:39,999 --> 00:12:45,709
the fingerprint that's hard coded into each radio unit, and

174
00:12:45,709 --> 00:12:51,209
the certificates are keyed to that fingerprint.

175
00:12:51,209 --> 00:12:54,959
So if you have a bad actor, the whole package

176
00:12:54,959 --> 00:13:00,999
of certificates are revoked by exposing the fingerprint.

177
00:13:02,751 --> 00:13:07,083
Each area have some real privacy challenges.

178
00:13:07,417 --> 00:13:09,918
The basic safety message.

179
00:13:09,918 --> 00:13:12,959
This is the glob that's sent out much

180
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:21,459
like the canned bus message that SAE's come up with a standard for it.

181
00:13:22,334 --> 00:13:25,959
The idea is it has a lot of really interesting stuff.

182
00:13:25,959 --> 00:13:27,417
I don't know if you can see that.

183
00:13:27,417 --> 00:13:28,417
It's very small.

184
00:13:28,709 --> 00:13:33,918
It has location, acceleration, the status of your braking system

185
00:13:33,918 --> 00:13:39,083
and each of these headers break down into individual values,

186
00:13:39,083 --> 00:13:46,250
like for the braking system each individual brake reports its status.

187
00:13:46,584 --> 00:13:52,334
To see if your interlock braking is engaged, track control,

188
00:13:52,334 --> 00:13:55,250
stability control.

189
00:13:55,542 --> 00:14:01,167
There are some other interesting things like message count

190
00:14:01,167 --> 00:14:06,167
but it also includes your speed, your acceleration,

191
00:14:06,167 --> 00:14:10,959
anticipated trajectory and your path.

192
00:14:10,999 --> 00:14:15,999
In order for this to become effective, you need to have density,

193
00:14:15,999 --> 00:14:20,083
because the benefit in a collision avoidance is not

194
00:14:20,083 --> 00:14:25,709
from your unit transmitting anything, it's from the unit that you would

195
00:14:25,709 --> 00:14:29,876
potentially hit transmitting their data.

196
00:14:29,918 --> 00:14:33,584
So you would need the more units, the more vehicles

197
00:14:33,584 --> 00:14:38,751
on the road that have this, the safer the road is.

198
00:14:40,626 --> 00:14:46,292
So the other side of the coin is confidence.

199
00:14:46,417 --> 00:14:49,999
If you don't believe that the messages you're getting

200
00:14:49,999 --> 00:14:53,876
in are accurate, then you'll ignore it.

201
00:14:56,999 --> 00:14:59,542
And this is where hackers come in.

202
00:14:59,999 --> 00:15:12,626
I was thinking about I'll get on to that later.

203
00:15:12,626 --> 00:15:14,417
Here I would like to point out that privacy

204
00:15:14,417 --> 00:15:18,209
is particularly important because if people don't trust it,

205
00:15:18,209 --> 00:15:21,417
then people will disable it and you wind up back

206
00:15:21,417 --> 00:15:23,999
with the first problem.

207
00:15:24,083 --> 00:15:28,999
If I don't feel like it's keeping my information private,

208
00:15:28,999 --> 00:15:34,459
then I will I'm going to be disabling it if I can't go anywhere

209
00:15:34,459 --> 00:15:38,999
without everybody being able to track me.

210
00:15:39,083 --> 00:15:42,083
So in order to attack the validity problem,

211
00:15:42,083 --> 00:15:46,792
they cryptographically signed all the certificates, and

212
00:15:46,792 --> 00:15:51,999
the certificates are issued by a central authority.

213
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:57,417
I think that should be raising some alarm bells with some of you.

214
00:15:57,709 --> 00:16:00,918
The question is who is that authority?

215
00:16:00,918 --> 00:16:04,459
There has been discussions each auto maker is its own authority.

216
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:06,959
There's a government authority that

217
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:08,999
issues certificates?

218
00:16:08,999 --> 00:16:09,999
Really?

219
00:16:09,999 --> 00:16:12,876
There's public private partnerships.

220
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:15,125
All sorts of things.

221
00:16:15,125 --> 00:16:17,125
And then the revocation.

222
00:16:17,459 --> 00:16:19,999
They plan on using a black list system.

223
00:16:20,584 --> 00:16:22,584
The Internet tried that, I think.

224
00:16:26,209 --> 00:16:27,417
(laughter).

225
00:16:27,417 --> 00:16:31,834
The idea is that the system, however, should invalidate itself

226
00:16:31,834 --> 00:16:34,999
if its sensor checks fail.

227
00:16:34,999 --> 00:16:37,959
It shouldn't be transmitting bad information

228
00:16:37,959 --> 00:16:41,501
if its internal checks are not working.

229
00:16:43,709 --> 00:16:47,584
They believe they have a lot of information available

230
00:16:47,584 --> 00:16:50,250
for sensor validations.

231
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:55,626
If they can't even control their own drones, who knows how that can go.

232
00:16:55,999 --> 00:17:00,459
So certificates, the idea is that they're limited time use so that

233
00:17:00,459 --> 00:17:03,959
you can't be tracked by a unique identifier,

234
00:17:03,959 --> 00:17:08,667
because as soon as you use the certificate for a little while,

235
00:17:08,667 --> 00:17:13,667
then it's as easy to track you by that certificate as it would be

236
00:17:13,667 --> 00:17:16,999
by any other unique identifier.

237
00:17:17,334 --> 00:17:20,375
The idea is that they're refreshed.

238
00:17:20,375 --> 00:17:24,501
You use I had discussions with people who were working

239
00:17:24,501 --> 00:17:26,999
on these radios.

240
00:17:26,999 --> 00:17:30,667
How big should we make our memory to store these certificates?

241
00:17:30,834 --> 00:17:33,501
And they were thinking on the order of three years.

242
00:17:34,584 --> 00:17:43,083
And it occurred to me three years to renew your certificates.

243
00:17:43,083 --> 00:17:45,999
By the way, you have to report the bad accuracy when you renew

244
00:17:45,999 --> 00:17:47,918
your certificates.

245
00:17:47,918 --> 00:17:51,167
So if you're only recording bad actors every three years and then you get

246
00:17:51,167 --> 00:17:53,999
a report back the next three years when you update,

247
00:17:53,999 --> 00:17:58,083
it becomes pretty clear that that's kind of a bad idea.

248
00:17:58,999 --> 00:18:00,667
So privacy.

249
00:18:00,667 --> 00:18:02,459
Here we go.

250
00:18:03,792 --> 00:18:06,999
Starting with Mac layer, at the very bottom.

251
00:18:07,626 --> 00:18:10,584
The idea is that there is a changeable source

252
00:18:10,584 --> 00:18:14,083
or no source addressed in the protocol.

253
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:20,334
This is been debated in the past.

254
00:18:20,501 --> 00:18:25,751
Whether it does or doesn't have that source, really it will come

255
00:18:25,751 --> 00:18:30,918
down to the implementation, because anybody who has worked

256
00:18:30,918 --> 00:18:35,999
closely with protocols understands that nobody implements

257
00:18:35,999 --> 00:18:38,876
a protocol perfectly.

258
00:18:38,999 --> 00:18:45,459
And so if the leading implementation winds up demanding a source address,

259
00:18:45,459 --> 00:18:50,626
then everybody has to use source addresses.

260
00:18:50,626 --> 00:18:53,083
And this is the first to market problem rather than

261
00:18:53,083 --> 00:18:55,999
a market penetration problem, because the first

262
00:18:55,999 --> 00:18:58,667
to market sets the standard.

263
00:18:58,959 --> 00:19:01,999
I'm thinking Hayes compatible modems.

264
00:19:14,209 --> 00:19:18,751
Any traffic to these devices would be unroutable.

265
00:19:19,292 --> 00:19:23,459
This is an interesting thought, considering we're talking

266
00:19:23,459 --> 00:19:27,709
about moving vehicles if you had only an address to, like,

267
00:19:27,709 --> 00:19:30,999
an infrastructure based station.

268
00:19:30,999 --> 00:19:33,999
That would be great, but the infrastructure based station

269
00:19:33,999 --> 00:19:36,250
would move out of range very quickly

270
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:40,292
and you would need some scheme to track that particular vehicle

271
00:19:40,292 --> 00:19:43,999
and which direction out of range it's gone and could come

272
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:46,792
up with a pretty good tracking system, even

273
00:19:46,792 --> 00:19:49,999
if you avoided tracking individuals.

274
00:19:53,167 --> 00:20:00,209
So there's no initial privacy concern, but the implementation in how

275
00:20:00,209 --> 00:20:04,834
they use it will create a problem.

276
00:20:04,876 --> 00:20:08,375
So coming back to what I showed you earlier, up there

277
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:14,250
in the header elements I just kind of grouped some like things.

278
00:20:14,501 --> 00:20:17,167
They have this temporary ID field.

279
00:20:17,459 --> 00:20:22,999
It is a specific field in the basic safety message itself.

280
00:20:22,999 --> 00:20:24,999
Temporary, that sounds pretty good.

281
00:20:24,999 --> 00:20:27,999
It's not a persistent identifier, but depending

282
00:20:27,999 --> 00:20:32,792
on the application implementation, it could be.

283
00:20:32,999 --> 00:20:36,918
Everybody's idea of temporary is somewhat different.

284
00:20:36,999 --> 00:20:40,334
My idea of temporary is no longer than five minutes plus

285
00:20:40,334 --> 00:20:42,334
or minus three.

286
00:20:42,334 --> 00:20:46,999
So I don't think everybody is on the same page.

287
00:20:47,125 --> 00:20:48,999
So certificates.

288
00:20:53,209 --> 00:20:57,334
They try to address the identity validity conflict.

289
00:20:57,834 --> 00:20:59,999
You want to trust somebody, but they don't want you

290
00:20:59,999 --> 00:21:02,167
to know who they are.

291
00:21:02,709 --> 00:21:07,250
And it's something that you deal with all the time struggling

292
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:12,375
between the authenticated user and the anonymous user.

293
00:21:14,542 --> 00:21:22,125
If we have constantly changing certificates with unsteady shift,

294
00:21:22,125 --> 00:21:25,751
then that could help.

295
00:21:25,999 --> 00:21:29,125
Once again, it depends on the implementation.

296
00:21:29,125 --> 00:21:33,792
But the biggest issue is the issuing authority who can control

297
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:38,417
it, who knows what vehicle maps to what fingerprint maps

298
00:21:38,417 --> 00:21:43,334
to what certificate and what location they are.

299
00:21:43,334 --> 00:21:47,459
There have been proposals that the units are shipped sealed and

300
00:21:47,459 --> 00:21:51,999
the fingerprint is not known to the auto maker.

301
00:21:51,999 --> 00:21:57,375
So they can't map a VIN, but then there have been proposals

302
00:21:57,375 --> 00:22:04,125
to the IATF that the VIN be used as the fingerprint, which is expose

303
00:22:04,125 --> 00:22:10,584
the VIN, expose the vehicle, the whole vehicle can no longer use

304
00:22:10,584 --> 00:22:13,834
the system ever again if there's

305
00:22:13,834 --> 00:22:20,542
a problem and then you wind up in the aftermarket use vehicle sector

306
00:22:20,542 --> 00:22:25,167
picking up radios just for their VIN.

307
00:22:30,626 --> 00:22:33,999
So the fingerprint, no correspondence.

308
00:22:34,083 --> 00:22:41,417
I think I've covered all this.

309
00:22:41,584 --> 00:22:47,209
So the delivery is the next challenge that I saw.

310
00:22:47,584 --> 00:22:51,667
How to get the certificates to the vehicle

311
00:22:51,667 --> 00:22:57,918
is we don't currently have mechanism to communicate that doesn't

312
00:22:57,918 --> 00:23:05,083
authenticate or uniquely identify both sides of the conversation.

313
00:23:05,751 --> 00:23:12,709
And most include some trackable method like I think cellular

314
00:23:12,709 --> 00:23:20,709
is the leading contender right now for certificate delivery.

315
00:23:22,542 --> 00:23:27,792
Wireless or even using DSRC end band and that hurts my head

316
00:23:27,792 --> 00:23:33,834
to think that end band certificate delivery could happen.

317
00:23:37,083 --> 00:23:40,626
There's just so many opportunities that that could entail.

318
00:23:40,999 --> 00:23:46,667
So more worrisome what's going on with this, I mentioned that

319
00:23:46,667 --> 00:23:51,375
the safety was only one channel on many channels

320
00:23:51,375 --> 00:23:54,501
of the DSRC spectrum.

321
00:23:55,125 --> 00:24:00,125
The other channels there's a lot of applications.

322
00:24:00,292 --> 00:24:06,167
They're talking about mesh networking routing,

323
00:24:06,167 --> 00:24:12,334
sharing MP3's with the other cars on the highway

324
00:24:12,334 --> 00:24:16,918
is the big joke about that.

325
00:24:17,083 --> 00:24:21,417
The advertising is one that particularly gets me,

326
00:24:21,417 --> 00:24:26,250
because that's not only a concern for people who bought

327
00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:31,083
a car and don't expect to be pummelled with advertising

328
00:24:31,083 --> 00:24:37,292
all the time, but also we've, I imagine, discussed different ways that

329
00:24:37,292 --> 00:24:42,167
advertising can be used as malware delivery.

330
00:24:42,334 --> 00:24:43,626
(laughter).

331
00:24:46,083 --> 00:24:49,334
What concerns me the most is the last one.

332
00:24:49,334 --> 00:24:51,959
I'm giving a talk tomorrow on data brokers,

333
00:24:51,959 --> 00:24:57,083
but data brokers using this fixed infrastructure, giving it to you

334
00:24:57,083 --> 00:25:02,999
for free so they can select all the data, which neighbors go to which malls

335
00:25:02,999 --> 00:25:06,292
and which neighbors go where.

336
00:25:06,999 --> 00:25:14,209
There is a lot of data in this system that cannot

337
00:25:14,209 --> 00:25:17,334
be overlooked.

338
00:25:23,542 --> 00:25:26,709
Another problem with in is law enforcement.

339
00:25:27,792 --> 00:25:32,125
You're transmitting your speed every tenth of a second, even if you're

340
00:25:32,125 --> 00:25:35,083
the most conscientious driver, occasionally you

341
00:25:35,083 --> 00:25:40,250
will be transmitting a speed that is over the posted speed limit.

342
00:25:40,375 --> 00:25:44,250
There's really published studies on there.

343
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:45,999
There's no way to get around that.

344
00:25:46,417 --> 00:25:49,876
Downhill, cross winds, suddenly shifting wind directions can

345
00:25:49,876 --> 00:25:52,792
push you over the speed limit.

346
00:25:54,542 --> 00:26:00,083
Can small law enforcement agencies start issuing tickets by mail?

347
00:26:00,083 --> 00:26:01,999
That's not very bright.

348
00:26:04,959 --> 00:26:08,626
It's possible to correlate location and speed and get

349
00:26:08,626 --> 00:26:13,751
a nice license plate reader to go along with the system so that when you

350
00:26:13,751 --> 00:26:18,584
pass through their camera, they can catch you that way.

351
00:26:18,999 --> 00:26:31,083
It's very easy to de anonymize this and law enforcement has

352
00:26:31,083 --> 00:26:35,999
at their disposal.

353
00:26:38,417 --> 00:26:44,876
So I know if I got a speed ticket in the mail, I would disable the system.

354
00:26:45,334 --> 00:26:50,083
I'm neither the most nor the least conscientious driver,

355
00:26:50,083 --> 00:26:55,501
but I don't want to expose myself to that specific vulnerability

356
00:26:55,501 --> 00:26:57,999
and that expense.

357
00:27:02,667 --> 00:27:04,751
So what can you do?

358
00:27:04,751 --> 00:27:07,083
And this is kind of a call to action to all of you.

359
00:27:07,083 --> 00:27:08,334
You're hackers.

360
00:27:08,334 --> 00:27:11,167
You have an idea about how these things can be broken

361
00:27:11,167 --> 00:27:14,292
probably even more than I do.

362
00:27:15,292 --> 00:27:18,417
The radios are commercially available.

363
00:27:20,167 --> 00:27:25,459
COHDA is the leading manufacturer right now.

364
00:27:25,459 --> 00:27:26,999
Cisco has an interest in them.

365
00:27:27,125 --> 00:27:35,250
They just released a brand new unit that is designated

366
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:44,999
as a reference design for production so that others can enter

367
00:27:44,999 --> 00:27:48,417
test with that.

368
00:27:52,584 --> 00:27:57,083
DSA is out there, but it's behind pay walls.

369
00:27:57,792 --> 00:28:02,125
I've tried to get a couple of other people to really play with it

370
00:28:02,125 --> 00:28:03,999
and break it.

371
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:07,375
All the documents are behind pay walls.

372
00:28:10,667 --> 00:28:13,083
And become politically engaged.

373
00:28:13,083 --> 00:28:15,667
The senate knows what this is.

374
00:28:15,751 --> 00:28:17,959
You guys should know what this is.

375
00:28:19,751 --> 00:28:23,083
Every auto manufacturer knows what this is.

376
00:28:23,709 --> 00:28:29,667
The administrative agencies, they're all totally on board with this.

377
00:28:29,918 --> 00:28:35,292
Hackers need to be jumping in and making a difference here.

378
00:28:37,459 --> 00:28:40,209
More than anything else, that certificate authority needs

379
00:28:40,209 --> 00:28:42,083
to be hashed out.

380
00:28:42,167 --> 00:28:47,792
If we're to maintain any privacy at all, there needs to be a separation

381
00:28:47,792 --> 00:28:53,250
between the government, the auto makers and the users.

382
00:28:53,667 --> 00:28:59,459
All three of these need to have a stake in this decision.

383
00:29:00,876 --> 00:29:05,999
So that pretty much concludes my slide show.

384
00:29:06,083 --> 00:29:08,959
I'd like to acknowledge a few people.

385
00:29:09,083 --> 00:29:13,292
Professor Dorothy Glancy led me down this path, and introduced me

386
00:29:13,292 --> 00:29:16,459
to a lot of people in DC 650.

387
00:29:16,459 --> 00:29:18,125
We kind of hammered this out.

388
00:29:18,667 --> 00:29:21,083
Here is my contact information.

389
00:29:21,083 --> 00:29:21,999
If you have questions, we have a microphone up here,

390
00:29:21,999 --> 00:29:24,083
if you would like to step forward.

391
00:29:31,542 --> 00:29:38,709
(applause)    How about the problem of false warnings and what would be

392
00:29:38,709 --> 00:29:43,959
the per vehicle cost of these new systems?

393
00:29:44,083 --> 00:29:46,999
How robust and the cost maintenance?

394
00:29:47,334 --> 00:29:50,999
Does it break every 30 days?

395
00:29:51,083 --> 00:29:56,709
The cost of the system, how robust, and also false warnings.

396
00:29:56,709 --> 00:29:58,083
CHRISTIE DUDLEY: Okay.

397
00:29:58,083 --> 00:30:00,501
False warnings, three questions.

398
00:30:00,501 --> 00:30:03,417
False warnings, the cost of the system, and maintenance.

399
00:30:03,417 --> 00:30:05,542
Those are all three very good questions.

400
00:30:06,209 --> 00:30:08,751
Every auto maker, of course, is going to have a different cost

401
00:30:08,751 --> 00:30:10,375
for their systems.

402
00:30:10,459 --> 00:30:13,334
The idea of this being a sealed system suggests that it's not

403
00:30:13,334 --> 00:30:16,125
going to break down for at least two or three years

404
00:30:16,125 --> 00:30:19,042
until your extended warranty is up.

405
00:30:19,042 --> 00:30:20,042
(applause).

406
00:30:20,042 --> 00:30:26,459
But the idea is it's supposed to be built very robust.

407
00:30:27,042 --> 00:30:33,626
And the third question was false positives.

408
00:30:33,667 --> 00:30:36,042
False positives is a really serious concern.

409
00:30:36,792 --> 00:30:40,584
Much of my report to the auto makers involved

410
00:30:40,584 --> 00:30:47,334
the threat of the false positive and the threat of the false report.

411
00:30:47,667 --> 00:30:52,334
There are a couple of other really obvious basic things.

412
00:30:52,876 --> 00:30:56,542
You can't cause collisions because there's a human involved,

413
00:30:56,542 --> 00:30:59,876
but you can cause traffic slowdowns.

414
00:30:59,918 --> 00:31:00,751
You can get people out of the way

415
00:31:00,751 --> 00:31:03,125
because you don't even have to tell them you're a police car,

416
00:31:03,125 --> 00:31:05,501
you can just tell them you're speeding and you're going

417
00:31:05,501 --> 00:31:08,209
to hit them and they'll get out of the way.

418
00:31:10,792 --> 00:31:13,959
So there's a lot of concern there.

419
00:31:15,834 --> 00:31:19,918
I have a question about the message globs,

420
00:31:19,918 --> 00:31:25,999
so when looking at them you said the source address is optional now

421
00:31:25,999 --> 00:31:30,626
and the ID that's included is temporary.

422
00:31:30,999 --> 00:31:34,876
How susceptible do you think they are to fingerprinting in general?

423
00:31:34,876 --> 00:31:37,542
For example, your browser could be fingerprinted

424
00:31:37,542 --> 00:31:40,999
just by the sequence of fonts that are installed

425
00:31:40,999 --> 00:31:43,375
and things like that.

426
00:31:43,375 --> 00:31:44,626
Can you comment on that?

427
00:31:44,626 --> 00:31:47,083
CHRISTIE DUDLEY: There are a couple of things.

428
00:31:47,083 --> 00:31:50,751
Another issue in the glob of data is the size of the vehicle.

429
00:31:51,834 --> 00:31:55,959
I'm fairly certain within a certain range you'll be able

430
00:31:55,959 --> 00:31:59,584
to identify manufacturer of vehicles.

431
00:31:59,667 --> 00:32:01,999
Beyond that I'm not sure.

432
00:32:01,999 --> 00:32:04,959
One of the things you bring up another point.

433
00:32:04,959 --> 00:32:09,751
One of the things that I think is very important to consider in privacy,

434
00:32:09,751 --> 00:32:14,083
you can get too far beyond where it's useful.

435
00:32:16,083 --> 00:32:19,918
Facial recognition technology is involved in my eyeballs

436
00:32:19,918 --> 00:32:24,501
and we don't consider that to be an invasion of privacy.

437
00:32:25,709 --> 00:32:28,876
If you don't consider an automatic thing

438
00:32:28,876 --> 00:32:34,584
a significant threat to your process, but as soon as the people get taken

439
00:32:34,584 --> 00:32:38,292
out of the system or the person who is operating

440
00:32:38,292 --> 00:32:43,250
the radio frequency fingerprinting, if you have to follow a car

441
00:32:43,250 --> 00:32:48,999
around to fingerprint or if you have to have careful spectrum analysis,

442
00:32:48,999 --> 00:32:53,626
I imagine you could do it at a mall parking lot or something

443
00:32:53,626 --> 00:32:58,167
like that where you're looking at the vehicle.

444
00:32:58,167 --> 00:33:01,542
But to identify a whole class of vehicles,

445
00:33:01,542 --> 00:33:08,083
you're not really narrowing it down to an individual so much.

446
00:33:08,083 --> 00:33:09,709
So it's a concern.

447
00:33:09,709 --> 00:33:15,999
It's not the biggest concern, I guess, is where I'm going with that.

448
00:33:15,999 --> 00:33:16,999
Thank you.

449
00:33:16,999 --> 00:33:17,999
Hi.

450
00:33:17,999 --> 00:33:20,999
Thank you for bringing this up to this particular community.

451
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:23,417
You know work for one of the agencies involved.

452
00:33:23,417 --> 00:33:24,709
CHRISTIE DUDLEY: Yes.

453
00:33:26,417 --> 00:33:28,999
Could you lower the microphone?

454
00:33:29,083 --> 00:33:31,167
Okay.

455
00:33:31,959 --> 00:33:35,167
Some of us have to look at the problems you brought up.

456
00:33:35,167 --> 00:33:38,167
I'm glad you're bringing it to the attention of this group.

457
00:33:38,167 --> 00:33:41,292
If you don't mind, what I'll do is to let the group know about some

458
00:33:41,292 --> 00:33:46,334
of the data sets that we're making available from the Ann Arbor test.

459
00:33:46,334 --> 00:33:49,167
CHRISTIE DUDLEY: You might as well mention your TLA.

460
00:33:49,167 --> 00:33:51,999
That's a web address.

461
00:33:51,999 --> 00:33:53,125
I'll repeat this twice.

462
00:33:53,417 --> 00:33:59,250
It's www.its rde.net.

463
00:34:01,918 --> 00:34:06,209
Www.its rde.net.

464
00:34:07,083 --> 00:34:14,250
That is the exchange that we have set up for the Ann Arbor test data.

465
00:34:14,292 --> 00:34:18,501
All the basic safety message that Christie talked about are available

466
00:34:18,501 --> 00:34:22,999
from that and we would like to put up an informal challenge where

467
00:34:22,999 --> 00:34:26,334
government agency and we are in sequester right now

468
00:34:26,334 --> 00:34:30,083
because we can't put any cash behind this, but we would

469
00:34:30,083 --> 00:34:33,167
like to challenge the community to take a look

470
00:34:33,167 --> 00:34:37,667
at that data and use that data set to identify any of the drivers

471
00:34:37,667 --> 00:34:40,959
without using social engineering.

472
00:34:43,125 --> 00:34:45,334
Just from the data set itself.

473
00:34:45,334 --> 00:34:49,876
We think we have it, but we're still in the prototype stage.

474
00:34:49,876 --> 00:34:52,709
We would like as many holes punched into this

475
00:34:52,709 --> 00:34:57,584
as technically possible now so we can fix those.

476
00:34:57,584 --> 00:34:58,999
Thank you again, Christie.

477
00:34:58,999 --> 00:35:02,542
CHRISTIE DUDLEY: And he brings up a very important point.

478
00:35:02,542 --> 00:35:04,417
The more we can hack on this right now,

479
00:35:04,417 --> 00:35:09,083
the better chance we will have of not seeing faulty units get installed

480
00:35:09,083 --> 00:35:12,999
in vehicles, because they're ready to roll.

481
00:35:13,209 --> 00:35:17,209
And we need to stop them if they're break things.

482
00:35:17,209 --> 00:35:21,167
Do you know how they plan on switching the fingerprint?

483
00:35:21,167 --> 00:35:24,999
So or switching the certificate?

484
00:35:24,999 --> 00:35:28,751
So I imagine a couple of problems with that.

485
00:35:28,999 --> 00:35:33,209
So if you switch it while you're driving and you have that path history;

486
00:35:33,209 --> 00:35:37,542
that would probably stay the same across different certificates

487
00:35:37,542 --> 00:35:41,334
so that you could correlate them together.

488
00:35:41,334 --> 00:35:44,167
If you only do that for a single run of the car, then you know where

489
00:35:44,167 --> 00:35:47,667
they start and where they end, and so you could probably identify

490
00:35:47,667 --> 00:35:49,334
them that way.

491
00:35:49,334 --> 00:35:51,959
So it seems pretty challenging to do that.

492
00:35:51,959 --> 00:35:53,083
CHRISTIE DUDLEY: Yeah.

493
00:35:53,083 --> 00:35:56,542
My recommendations were based on the average trip length.

494
00:35:56,751 --> 00:36:00,626
And so you want assert that lasts no longer than half your average

495
00:36:00,626 --> 00:36:02,375
trip length.

496
00:36:02,999 --> 00:36:08,292
And there's a lot of discussion about when you start transmitting.

497
00:36:08,584 --> 00:36:11,501
If you want to do it at the point where

498
00:36:11,501 --> 00:36:17,250
the power door locks engage, so you don't know exactly quite where

499
00:36:17,250 --> 00:36:21,209
they started, but you do get that information

500
00:36:21,209 --> 00:36:24,584
as soon as it's necessary.

501
00:36:24,584 --> 00:36:26,999
So there's a lot of thought that's going

502
00:36:26,999 --> 00:36:29,417
into at what points.

503
00:36:29,417 --> 00:36:32,751
Like my recommendation also was not to have fixed periods,

504
00:36:32,751 --> 00:36:36,918
but rather have a plus or minus and have a little randomness

505
00:36:36,918 --> 00:36:41,417
in there so that they can't set up listening stations to track you

506
00:36:41,417 --> 00:36:44,083
as you leave their store.

507
00:36:45,667 --> 00:36:50,250
My thought is a big box store wants to know if you left and went

508
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:56,083
to their competitor or where did you go when you left their store.

509
00:36:56,083 --> 00:36:59,584
So where were you before you came?

510
00:36:59,709 --> 00:37:05,167
The idea that having a flexible length and minimum

511
00:37:05,167 --> 00:37:10,876
of half the average trip size or maximum.

512
00:37:10,876 --> 00:37:11,876
Great.

513
00:37:14,375 --> 00:37:15,667
Thanks.

514
00:37:15,667 --> 00:37:16,667
Hi.

515
00:37:16,667 --> 00:37:18,876
This was focused mainly on emerging DSRC.

516
00:37:18,876 --> 00:37:20,209
My question is how much or are you involved in some

517
00:37:20,209 --> 00:37:23,167
of the other things that are emerging, for instance of the Calematics

518
00:37:23,167 --> 00:37:24,999
out of Detroit.

519
00:37:26,375 --> 00:37:29,999
CHRISTIE DUDLEY: I'm not really involved in any

520
00:37:29,999 --> 00:37:33,083
of the other specialty systems.

521
00:37:33,167 --> 00:37:35,709
My specialty is privacy.

522
00:37:36,876 --> 00:37:41,501
I look at a variety of embedded devices.

523
00:37:41,792 --> 00:37:44,626
Automotive privacy is very interesting to me,

524
00:37:44,626 --> 00:37:47,999
because even more than your cellphone, which

525
00:37:47,999 --> 00:37:51,999
is my previous research, even more than your cellphone,

526
00:37:51,999 --> 00:37:57,209
your vehicle tells where you've been, where you're going, and it tells

527
00:37:57,209 --> 00:38:03,542
a lot about you, who you associate with and where you spend your time.

528
00:38:03,999 --> 00:38:07,083
It says a lot about you.

529
00:38:08,459 --> 00:38:10,999
So it's critical that neither the government

530
00:38:10,999 --> 00:38:13,834
nor the advertisers take that information from you

531
00:38:13,834 --> 00:38:15,999
without your consent.

532
00:38:15,999 --> 00:38:19,999
In that case I would point you to Calematics Detroit.

533
00:38:20,083 --> 00:38:21,999
If you Google that, the session abstract

534
00:38:21,999 --> 00:38:24,918
for every session of that conference    CHRISTIE

535
00:38:24,918 --> 00:38:28,125
DUDLEY: Oh, I'm aware of the conference.

536
00:38:28,125 --> 00:38:30,375
Split up all the data in the car.

537
00:38:30,751 --> 00:38:31,751
So thank you.

538
00:38:31,751 --> 00:38:33,209
CHRISTIE DUDLEY: Thank you.

539
00:38:34,959 --> 00:38:37,876
I had two questions.

540
00:38:37,876 --> 00:38:40,125
CHRISTIE DUDLEY: Closer to the microphone.

541
00:38:40,417 --> 00:38:41,667
Sorry.

542
00:38:41,959 --> 00:38:43,999
I had two questions.

543
00:38:43,999 --> 00:38:47,999
The first one was what sorts of displays would be would we be

544
00:38:47,999 --> 00:38:53,375
looking at as far as, like, getting the driver information?

545
00:38:53,375 --> 00:38:57,792
And the second question was would there be any drawbacks to, like,

546
00:38:57,792 --> 00:39:02,083
the certificates changing before the trip has ended as far

547
00:39:02,083 --> 00:39:04,125
as its safety?

548
00:39:04,501 --> 00:39:08,125
CHRISTIE DUDLEY: Okay.

549
00:39:08,501 --> 00:39:13,334
First, here is an example of the display they have in mind.

550
00:39:13,459 --> 00:39:16,999
This is one of several different things they've been

551
00:39:16,999 --> 00:39:22,667
toying around with a small display in the center of the dash.

552
00:39:22,918 --> 00:39:27,334
They have talked about lights in various places in the cockpit there

553
00:39:27,334 --> 00:39:31,999
is a lot of human interaction research that's done on what kind

554
00:39:31,999 --> 00:39:37,292
of displays and everybody has a little bit different idea.

555
00:39:37,292 --> 00:39:38,959
What was your second question?

556
00:39:38,959 --> 00:39:42,626
Is there any drawbacks to having the certificates changed

557
00:39:42,626 --> 00:39:45,876
before the trip is completed?

558
00:39:45,876 --> 00:39:49,083
Like you have one car driving and it's one car to the computers

559
00:39:49,083 --> 00:39:53,751
and then, like, instantly it changes to another car.

560
00:39:53,751 --> 00:39:56,334
CHRISTIE DUDLEY: Persistence of vision.

561
00:39:56,417 --> 00:39:57,876
Cars can do it, too.

562
00:39:58,667 --> 00:40:03,417
The cars around you don't get confused when the certificate changes.

563
00:40:03,542 --> 00:40:06,209
In fact, you wouldn't even notice.

564
00:40:06,584 --> 00:40:09,584
One of the concerns about changing certificates is well,

565
00:40:09,584 --> 00:40:13,292
if you were to be followed, then they would be able to track

566
00:40:13,292 --> 00:40:16,834
the certificate changes, but if you should be followed,

567
00:40:16,834 --> 00:40:19,459
then you're being followed.

568
00:40:22,417 --> 00:40:28,999
So the real interest is in just the persistence at the point of change.

569
00:40:28,999 --> 00:40:32,209
That shouldn't be a problem, because what the system does

570
00:40:32,209 --> 00:40:34,999
is it takes the packet and validates it

571
00:40:34,999 --> 00:40:38,584
and then strips the certificate off.

572
00:40:38,999 --> 00:40:42,999
So all the processing is done once the packet's been validated.

573
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:46,999
So it really shouldn't change anything at all.

574
00:40:47,999 --> 00:40:49,209
Okay?

575
00:40:50,167 --> 00:40:53,918
Is this system supposed to be operating internationally?

576
00:40:53,918 --> 00:40:55,999
CHRISTIE DUDLEY: Yes.

577
00:40:55,999 --> 00:41:00,542
If yes, then how do you solve the foreign certificate issue?

578
00:41:00,542 --> 00:41:04,417
CHRISTIE DUDLEY: The European bandwidth that is available

579
00:41:04,417 --> 00:41:09,542
is the same as the bandwidth in the United States and they plan

580
00:41:09,542 --> 00:41:14,999
to do the same protocols in Europe as the United States.

581
00:41:15,083 --> 00:41:17,999
The only difference is in Japan where that bandwidth

582
00:41:17,999 --> 00:41:19,918
is not available.

583
00:41:19,999 --> 00:41:22,626
It's been allocated elsewhere.

584
00:41:28,918 --> 00:41:33,626
The law makers that are working on this, I worked with three European,

585
00:41:33,626 --> 00:41:37,918
three American, and three Japanese auto makers.

586
00:41:37,918 --> 00:41:42,918
They were adamant about having the exact same system in the U.S.

587
00:41:42,918 --> 00:41:43,918
and in Europe.

588
00:41:43,999 --> 00:41:47,292
What about certificate authorities?

589
00:41:47,292 --> 00:41:50,667
CHRISTIE DUDLEY: That's a really good question.

590
00:41:50,999 --> 00:41:54,999
And when you start crossing international borders,

591
00:41:54,999 --> 00:42:00,334
the government piece of the three interests changes.

592
00:42:00,876 --> 00:42:06,667
And there will be all sorts of interesting wrangling in that respect.

593
00:42:06,999 --> 00:42:08,459
That's a very good point.

594
00:42:10,959 --> 00:42:15,501
The gentleman from the ITSRDE described this

595
00:42:15,501 --> 00:42:18,709
as a prototype system.

596
00:42:18,918 --> 00:42:23,417
You described the user enter base as very much under development.

597
00:42:23,999 --> 00:42:28,125
You mentioned this is expected to ship on high end automobiles

598
00:42:28,125 --> 00:42:30,918
for the 2014 model year.

599
00:42:31,083 --> 00:42:32,918
Those are on the lot now.

600
00:42:32,999 --> 00:42:37,083
And 2015 cars you were thinking about that maybe being a mandate.

601
00:42:38,250 --> 00:42:41,792
That seems contradictory to me.

602
00:42:41,918 --> 00:42:43,999
Can you explain where we're at in the development cycle

603
00:42:43,999 --> 00:42:47,834
and how close we really are to having these on the road?

604
00:42:47,834 --> 00:42:55,999
CHRISTIE DUDLEY: I don't know the stuff on the lot right now.

605
00:42:56,083 --> 00:42:58,334
I don't follow model years.

606
00:42:58,334 --> 00:43:00,375
As I mentioned, my specialty is privacy.

607
00:43:00,709 --> 00:43:03,667
I do know that they were working when I spoke

608
00:43:03,667 --> 00:43:07,999
with them around this time last year, August, I wasn't able to come

609
00:43:07,999 --> 00:43:12,209
to DEF CON because I was working on this project.

610
00:43:13,459 --> 00:43:16,918
When I was speaking with them that last August,

611
00:43:16,918 --> 00:43:21,083
they were talking about already having radios.

612
00:43:21,083 --> 00:43:23,959
And I actually got to put my hands on some.

613
00:43:24,292 --> 00:43:27,083
And they already had the radios.

614
00:43:27,083 --> 00:43:29,626
They already were trying to get them in the cars.

615
00:43:29,709 --> 00:43:31,999
And so that's the best information I have.

616
00:43:33,626 --> 00:43:38,959
When I say "high end," I mean the BMW's who are doing automatic

617
00:43:38,959 --> 00:43:42,334
parking and the various where they're kind

618
00:43:42,334 --> 00:43:46,999
of going off a little bit on their own that.

619
00:43:47,375 --> 00:43:52,209
The user interfaces, there wouldn't be no uniform interface,

620
00:43:52,209 --> 00:43:57,083
just like there is no uniform car interior.

621
00:43:57,250 --> 00:44:00,167
Every auto maker will have its own interpretation

622
00:44:00,167 --> 00:44:04,918
of the kinds of alarms and the way that they will alarm you.

623
00:44:04,918 --> 00:44:08,999
That seems really scary to me.

624
00:44:08,999 --> 00:44:11,542
I mean, if I'm used to, to use your example, a BMW,

625
00:44:11,542 --> 00:44:15,876
and then I rent a Cadillac and the system is different, I'm not used

626
00:44:15,876 --> 00:44:18,999
to the warning systems, I'm sure lawyers would love

627
00:44:18,999 --> 00:44:21,876
to argue liability over that.

628
00:44:21,876 --> 00:44:24,167
CHRISTIE DUDLEY: Well, the liability of not responding

629
00:44:24,167 --> 00:44:28,167
to a warning system is what you're talking about there.

630
00:44:28,167 --> 00:44:31,999
And that's a really interesting point that I don't think anybody else

631
00:44:31,999 --> 00:44:33,834
has discussed.

632
00:44:33,918 --> 00:44:38,999
Yeah, to argue the liability for not responding, that would be

633
00:44:38,999 --> 00:44:43,667
an interesting argument because the situation you would be

634
00:44:43,667 --> 00:44:49,834
in there would be that somebody was driving erratically and it was the duty

635
00:44:49,834 --> 00:44:55,083
of the person who was not driving erratically to heed the warnings

636
00:44:55,083 --> 00:44:58,125
and get out of their way.

637
00:44:58,125 --> 00:45:01,667
So that's the only situation where the liability would be at issue.
