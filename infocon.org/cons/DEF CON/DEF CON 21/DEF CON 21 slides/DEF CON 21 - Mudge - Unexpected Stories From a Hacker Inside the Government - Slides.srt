1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:05,880
 PEITER MUDGE ZATKO: Just so we're clear,
I'm only speaking as myself today. I am not

2
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:11,519
a representative of the US Government. I'm
not a representative of my current employer.

3
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:15,940
I'm pretty sure neither one of them would
be really happy with me up here talking. But,

4
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:22,940
I feel it's part of my duty as part of this
community to kind of give you some stories

5
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:28,920
that are personal stories from this community
as what I took into the Government, what I

6
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:32,570
learned while I was in the Government, what
I saw that was a little bizarre while I was

7
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:37,269
in the Government. And what I'm taking back
out of it.

8
00:00:37,269 --> 00:00:44,269
And there are four stories I'm going to tell
you that all have some unexpected outcomes

9
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:48,210
and unexpected twists. You probably heard
about some of the stories in the media, but

10
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:54,100
these are kind of different back origins to
them that you haven't heard before. I'll do

11
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:58,210
my best to be as accurate as possible. But
I'm going from memory from some of these,

12
00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:04,920
and some of these go back several years. Memory
isn't perfect, so I apologize in advance.

13
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:11,920
So I'm not trying to piss off or be pro or
con any particular community, but I want

14
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:21,710
understandings, which I why I'm trying to
tell these kind of nonobvious stories. Somebody

15
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:25,950
had tweeted me something encouraging me to
do this talk and saying anything we can do

16
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:32,040
to help people understand each other is good,
because of course prejudice is bred from ignorance

17
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:38,240
and exclusion. So you can kind of consider
this my transparency/trip report from three

18
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:45,240
years inside the DoD.
Not long after I started working at DARPA,

19
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:51,250
I got funding approval for the first of one
of many programs that I would actually run.

20
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:53,700
I know most folks are only familiar with a
few of them.

21
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:59,700
The first program was called CINDER. And it
was focused on super evolved advanced persistent

22
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:03,810
threat. The program had nothing to do with
whistle blowers. It had nothing to do with

23
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:10,810
humans. It was targeting autonomous software.
And there was an author, Forbes Magazine,

24
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:17,370
Andy Greenburg, who found out that Julian
Assange and I knew each other and have kind

25
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:24,310
of known each for, I don't know, 20 plus years.
And he wrote an article that, the way I read

26
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:28,260
the article, attempted to pit me and Julian
against each other, claiming that CINDER was

27
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:34,230
a response to WikiLeaks. You know, a sexy
story of hacker friends, you know, who now

28
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:38,200
find themselves at odds, one trying to spill
the Government secrets, one trying to protect

29
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:42,350
the Government secrets. Yeah, it's a sexy
story, the problem is it's entirely untrue.

30
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:47,900
Because CINDER had nothing to do with that.
So since he and other folks wanted to kind

31
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:53,410
of make it a story about me and Julian where
there was no story before, I figured I'd tell

32
00:02:53,410 --> 00:03:00,410
you an actual story about me and Julian.
And this first story is called how the DoD

33
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:08,780
unintentionally created WikiLeaks. So it was
2009. I had yet to go into DARPA. I was over

34
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:18,349
in Germany for the CCC Congress, which by
the way is awesome. And by the way, Berlin

35
00:03:18,349 --> 00:03:25,349
is freezing in December. So it's a couple
blocks from the hotel over to the Congress.

36
00:03:26,349 --> 00:03:29,580
And I braved it across. It takes about
like 10 or 15 minutes before your lips come

37
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:32,250
back and you can actually start to form words
again.

38
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:36,620
So there was this talk that I wanted to see
at the Congress. I watched it. It was great.

39
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:40,959
There was a gap between the next talk I that
wanted to see, and the whole decision was

40
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:47,440
do I go back to the hotel and go out in the
frigid Berlin winter, or do I find something

41
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:52,510
else to pass the time. It's CCC, it's easy
to find things to pass the time there. And

42
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:58,620
there was a talk that was going on about WikiLeaks.
Remember, 2009. No State Department cables,

43
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:03,489
no nothing at this point. WikiLeaks had been
around, but it wasn't in the popular vernacular.

44
00:04:03,489 --> 00:04:09,270
It wasn't a household name.
So I look and I go, Oh, what it's taking to

45
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:13,040
run WikiLeaks, how do we do it behind-the-scenes
operationally. I go: That's cool. And it talks

46
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:18,600
in English and it's inside. So yea. And I'm
looking at it, Julian Assange, Julian Assange.

47
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:22,520
The name was ringing a bell but it didn't
mean anything again, because of course he

48
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:27,540
didn't hit it.
Now I saw him on stage, and you know he's

49
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:34,190
a kind of striking physical --> you know, shocking
blonde white hair, sharply dressed, and I'm

50
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:38,100
recognizing the voice and it took almost the
entire talk before it dawned on me that I

51
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:42,280
knew him by a different name. I knew him as
Prof. Some of you remember Prof, some of you

52
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:49,280
remember strobe that he wrote like ages ago.
You know, he was over at suburbia.net --> profitsuburbia.net.

53
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:54,940
I was like holy crap! This is the same guy
who I've known for years. I hadn't seen him

54
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:59,910
in like a decade or I hadn't interacted with
him online. At one point I think he was even

55
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:06,910
managing Sun's security updates and patches
for all of the distributions for Sun Us at

56
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:14,100
sunsite.unc.edu. So we should have nominated
that for possible or potential epic ownage.

57
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:20,050
That's kind of cool if you think about that.
So after the talk I was all excited. I went

58
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:24,030
up to him, waited until the smaller crowds
died. You know, he was outside having a cigarette.

59
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:27,080
I thought this is going to be fun, because
I had cut my hair. You know, I didn't have

60
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:33,790
the (inhales sharply) if you've seen the shirts.
Most people remember me looking slightly different.

61
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:39,430
And I'm like oh, I'm going to play with this
a little bit. So I walk up to him. I know

62
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:42,710
he doesn't know my voice, and he's not going
to physically recognize me. So I do that whole

63
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:48,199
like hacker jerk sort of, you know, say something
that, you know, like what the hell how did

64
00:05:48,199 --> 00:05:50,729
they know that? And kind of to set up the
state of detant.

65
00:05:50,729 --> 00:05:56,520
I go hey, when was the last time somebody
called you prof? He looks at me weird. And

66
00:05:56,520 --> 00:06:02,110
I'm like well, if you think that's weird,
did they ever find out why the MD 5 checksums

67
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:06,580
on the Solaris update patches didn't match
the actual patches that people installed?

68
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:12,960
It was Sunsite, right? And he is just looking
at me like who the heck is this guy? Probably

69
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:16,310
possibly because he hadn't heard the phrase
"prof" for a while and it could very well

70
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:19,919
be that he had no clue what I was talking
about with the latter one.

71
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:25,070
And I go hey, it's me, it's Mudge, Mudge from
the LOpht sort of thing, and he kind of relaxed

72
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:32,070
and we chuckled about it. And I was saying
hey, you know, you were really, really passionate

73
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:39,850
up on stage about WikiLeaks. What was the
real impetus? What was the turning point that

74
00:06:40,699 --> 00:06:47,699
made you do that? Because the last I had seen
you, you were leaving the hack scene. Going

75
00:06:47,729 --> 00:06:52,509
off to academia to do your advanced degree.
He was working on a crytographically based

76
00:06:52,509 --> 00:06:59,509
file system, a rubber hose file system for
duress-based decrypting. And I said where

77
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:03,960
did you go? The old gang and everything, I
haven't seen you.

78
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:08,680
So we chatted and he said let's go out and
have dinner. So we spent the next several

79
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:15,680
hours over food in Berlin. And we were chatting,
and I wanted to know just how passionate he

80
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:22,780
was. And how far he was willing to go on it.
So I asked him a hypothetical question. I

81
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:29,780
said let's suppose back in the day my thing
was I collected packet captures of everything.

82
00:07:31,639 --> 00:07:37,669
Let's assume some of those packet captures
have you going into the other systems. You

83
00:07:37,669 --> 00:07:42,539
know, beyond a shadow of a doubt. If I submitted
those packet captures, kind of incriminating

84
00:07:42,539 --> 00:07:49,539
you to WikiLeaks, would you release them?
And he looked at me, it only took a couple

85
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:55,199
seconds. He said hey, we get some very similar
sorts of questions. Because people ask us,

86
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:58,960
you know, kind of on a parallel if someone
were to send us a list of the contributors

87
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:05,430
to WikiLeaks, would we publish it? And the
answer is that, you know, we don't want to

88
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:08,490
know who our contributors are, because we
want to keep the protection there, "we" being

89
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:13,770
WikiLeaks I'm speaking of as him from memory
here. So we try to get in touch with the folks

90
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:18,639
who contributed, but we won't know who they
are. So ultimately in case that list is real,

91
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:22,520
we would have to publish it. I was like oh,
that's cool. And then we moved on to the next

92
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:26,190
topic.
Now if any of you actually interacted with

93
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:30,740
him or knows somebody who has, they will tell
you that he is a very smart person and it's

94
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:37,740
absolutely right. It took me probably an hour
to realize he never answered my question.

95
00:08:38,899 --> 00:08:45,899
But he told me an interesting story. He told
me, and this is what stuck with me in 2009

96
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:51,959
from that dinner, what the turning point was.
Maybe this was a story just for me, maybe

97
00:08:51,959 --> 00:08:56,260
it was kind of the appropriate thing. But
I took this to be kind of ground truth and

98
00:08:56,260 --> 00:09:00,050
it stuck with me, which is why I'm telling
you. And I used to tell people inside the

99
00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:05,459
Government the same question when later WikiLeaks
kind of popped up. He said I had gone off,

100
00:09:05,459 --> 00:09:12,080
I was over at University doing my graduate
work. Something essentially fundamental research,

101
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:17,880
which means something to the Government folks.
He said it was funded, you know, by the US

102
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:23,180
Government. It was a grant from like NSA type
DARPA sort of funding. I don't know if those

103
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:28,380
were the actual agencies.
And he said it was during that time period

104
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:34,140
where there was a big pull back from the DoD.
And the message that the Universities received

105
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:41,140
was we're not funding you to do basic research
anymore. It's all classified now. His work

106
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,620
got rolled up in that.
Now, whether that was actually why it was

107
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:48,770
being pulled back or if that was just the
perceived message, I don't know. So if you

108
00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:55,770
think about it. Here is a nonUS citizen, who's
made a life decision, go to graduate work,

109
00:09:56,580 --> 00:10:02,899
kind of leave the community that we knew him
in. And all of a sudden his funding gets pulled

110
00:10:02,899 --> 00:10:06,480
and he is told that he is not allowed to know
what it was he was doing, not allowed to know

111
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:11,839
what he discovered, and no actual reason as
to why the funding went. I mean, it's kind

112
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:17,279
of what it's like when you're a graduate student
and somebody pulls your funding, sort of thing.

113
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:22,630
And this just really, really rubbed him wrong.
He said this is the wrong reason for classification,

114
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:27,420
if that's why he lost his funding. This was
designed to keep people ignorant and withhold

115
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:34,110
information to keep folks disadvantaged.
He said it was at that point he decided that

116
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:39,700
he was going to devote his life to exposing
people who tried to keep secrets. And hence

117
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:45,149
WikiLeaks was born.
So when folks in the DoD would ask me, hey,

118
00:10:45,149 --> 00:10:51,870
do you know this WikiLeaks thing and what
are your thoughts on how we could like, you

119
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:57,529
know, address it? They were surprised with
my answer by saying you know by some accounts,

120
00:10:57,529 --> 00:11:02,630
the Government actually created it in the
first place.

121
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:08,600
It was at that point during the night at the
-- in the restaurant, Julian goes well, so

122
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:11,839
that's what I've been doing for the past ten
years. What are you up to? I said oh, I'm

123
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:18,839
about to go work at DARPA. (laughter)
So that's my first story.

124
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:26,380
The second story is about Anonymous and the
Department of Defense. I remember Anonymous

125
00:11:33,269 --> 00:11:37,560
from way back. I mean, Anonymous, I use it
as like a proper noun. But obviously we're

126
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:41,519
all familiar and it's much more. It's kind
of a movement, a thought. It's more ephemeral

127
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:47,510
than that. And when I remember them they were
going after scientology and RIA and there

128
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:54,510
were the FORTRANs and soap opera stuff going
on. And at some point, their scope or the

129
00:11:54,750 --> 00:12:01,750
target expanded to include the Government.
And general wisdom was that the triggering

130
00:12:02,329 --> 00:12:09,149
event was the DoD's response to WikiLeaks
and Manning, et cetera. But the way I saw

131
00:12:09,149 --> 00:12:16,149
it, there was actually something else that
was a bit more subtle that folks hadn't realized.

132
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:24,060
So in 2011, the DoD released the strategy
for operating in cyberspace. There was some

133
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:29,750
very minor backlash to some of the wording.
There was originally a version leaked of it,

134
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:34,060
and that went out and it was followed up later
by a later one. But there was some more specific

135
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:41,060
backlash and chatter in the hacker researcher
community. The strategy stated that the DoD

136
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:49,750
was going to treat cyberspace as a domain
to conduct operations in. And it appeared

137
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:55,870
kind of modeled off of outer space, you know,
treating space as, you know, these are DoDish

138
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:59,750
words, a domain. And there were some confused
conversations going oh, why isn't anybody

139
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:05,690
upset if you treat cyberspace as a domain,
there wasn't that much upset with treating

140
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:12,339
space, and nobody lives in cyberspace, which
you could only hear inside the Government,

141
00:13:12,339 --> 00:13:18,070
like a statement like that. Because if you
think about it, you know, we all live in cyberspace.

142
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:21,750
And the hacker researcher community made it
-- you know, made cyberspace-- I'm really

143
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:28,750
not a fan of that word --> made the Internet
and online our homes well before the Government

144
00:13:29,959 --> 00:13:33,700
and everybody else kind of made it just where
they always lived and did everything in.

145
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:40,700
So if you send a message that that's somebody's
backyard and that you're going to militarize

146
00:13:40,829 --> 00:13:47,829
and prep for war in somebody's backyard, that
can sound really scary. And it can galvanize

147
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:57,060
folks to respond.
One of the problems was there was not an understanding

148
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:04,440
as to who the message was actually intended
for. So in addition to treating it as a domain,

149
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:11,160
they said something else, which was and in
response to --> and I'm paraphrasing --> but

150
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:17,480
in response to hacks, we will consider responding
with kinetic force.

151
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:22,040
So if you don't actually specifically call
out who the recipient of the message is, everybody

152
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:28,010
reading it thinks it's directed to them. I
read it. I thought it was directed to me.

153
00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:33,889
And I'm going like what the heck? You know,
I joke my buddy and I replace his, you know,

154
00:14:33,889 --> 00:14:40,399
the HTML, the main Web Page, and that's considered
a hack and all of a sudden I've got somebody

155
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:45,850
launching a patriot missile at me? I mean,
this makes no sense. What level of hack? Because

156
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:50,089
if we look at like CFAA response, maybe they
actually think a patriot missile is the right

157
00:14:50,089 --> 00:14:56,070
thing for defaceing a website. I don't know.
And none of these are the right questions.

158
00:14:56,070 --> 00:15:00,480
Because I'm not the intended audience, but
of course I'm reading it as if I was. And

159
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:05,209
of course the logical next question is wait,
do they understand how attribution works?

160
00:15:05,209 --> 00:15:11,800
Because what if I do it bouncing through an
ally? What if I do it from within the U.S.

161
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:18,800
Are they going to kineticically respond against
themselves? And you kind of go okay, wait.

162
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:23,440
Back up.
If the message were directed to, let's say,

163
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:30,440
you know, other countries, somebody in specific
that has a significant power that they say

164
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:35,720
look, we're talking about critical infrastructure
or something of that nature, if you turn off

165
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:39,529
the lights in New York, we will probably be
able to figure out who you are, because you're

166
00:15:39,529 --> 00:15:44,300
not a small little hacker defacing Web sites
and maybe there is attribution in place that

167
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:47,800
we could respond to. That would have been
an entirely different sort of message and

168
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:52,579
I wouldn't have read it as the whole like
wow, if I get in root on something in my own

169
00:15:52,579 --> 00:15:58,089
system, is the Government going to shoot me?
Which is just silly. But I wasn't the only

170
00:15:58,089 --> 00:16:03,910
person who read it that way.
And it's nice having been in this field and

171
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:10,910
in the hacker researcher community for going
on almost 25 years, actually, over 25 years,

172
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:15,790
and some folks were sending me --> saying hey,
have you seen what's going on in the chat

173
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:21,880
rooms? And there were folks who were claiming
affiliation or claiming support of Anonymous

174
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:26,529
going hey, have you read this? Look who is
trying to prep for war in our backyards? Do

175
00:16:26,529 --> 00:16:30,920
they even understand how attribution works?
This is bullshit. If they think they can find

176
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:35,380
me, it's on. Let's go.
And the next thing you know there were a couple

177
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:42,380
Web sites defaced, and they ended in like
dot gov. Now this is where it gets kind of

178
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:50,440
funky. Defacing a website is kind of a message.
It's a little warning shot. But that's in

179
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:58,079
a language that Govies don't know. So the
Govies didn't get the message as far as, you

180
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:01,959
know, what I saw.
So here's the initial strategy for operating

181
00:17:01,959 --> 00:17:06,359
in cyberspace that goes out. Probably directed
to somebody else, but by poor messaging is

182
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:10,759
misinterpreted by the group. The group responds,
fires a warning shot. The warning shot isn't

183
00:17:10,759 --> 00:17:14,799
understood. And it's like hey, what these
vagabonds are doing? Look at the little street

184
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:17,869
punks, or whatever. They're not somebody who
actually has a message that we should actually

185
00:17:17,869 --> 00:17:21,689
engage in. And it's just this little cascading
effect.

186
00:17:21,689 --> 00:17:28,689
So that is kind of unfortunately where I saw,
you know, the expanding of scope and a lot

187
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:34,090
of misunderstandings. I'm not saying the two
groups should be friends. I'm not saying one

188
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:38,749
group is good and one group is bad. But when
you send a message out into the world, and

189
00:17:38,749 --> 00:17:43,879
this is for both groups, you really need to
make sure it's understandable by all the parties

190
00:17:43,879 --> 00:17:47,279
that are going to receive it. You can't assume
it's just going to be read by the person you

191
00:17:47,279 --> 00:17:51,869
had in mind.
With all love and respect, there is one very

192
00:17:51,869 --> 00:17:56,869
obvious commonality between the hacker researcher
group and the Government, and it's that they

193
00:17:56,869 --> 00:18:00,979
can be very arrogant and expect that everybody
will speak their own language and they don't

194
00:18:00,979 --> 00:18:06,210
have to speak anybody else's. And I think
that's a very common mistake.

195
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:10,659
So the recommendation for the Government from
my vantage point on both sides is figure out

196
00:18:10,659 --> 00:18:14,389
how your messages are going to be received
by the more general populace of cyberspace,

197
00:18:14,389 --> 00:18:20,090
because we all live there now. This is actually
a great opportunity for diplomacy. You can

198
00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:25,139
kind of think of it like the lost City of
Atlantis. Because cyberspace kind of took

199
00:18:25,139 --> 00:18:28,190
the world, I think, the world by surprise.
Obviously it hasn't been around that long.

200
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:33,149
So what if Atlantis just popped pack up. And
there was an advanced, very capable technical

201
00:18:33,149 --> 00:18:37,200
group of people there, you wouldn't sit there
and ignore them. You wouldn't taunt them.

202
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,580
You wouldn't attack them. You'd probably actually
try to understand them and figure out how

203
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:44,549
messaging to somebody else might be interpreted
by them. And you might even try and figure

204
00:18:44,549 --> 00:18:50,210
out where you guys are and where you see things
eye to eye and where you have differences.

205
00:18:50,210 --> 00:18:55,519
So my recommendations to the citizens of cyberspace
is keep in mind that the Government and in

206
00:18:55,519 --> 00:19:02,029
particular the DoD has very specific focuses
and goals. And they often only see things

207
00:19:02,029 --> 00:19:07,379
from their own point of view. Because they're
really focused on doing that job.

208
00:19:07,379 --> 00:19:12,489
And when you read things that appear to be
a message directed to you or your community,

209
00:19:12,489 --> 00:19:17,700
coming from an unlikely source, you should
question whether or not the message is actually

210
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:22,080
intended for you. Or if it's just intended
for somebody else and really poorly worded.

211
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:26,999
And if you still think a response is necessary,
you really need to think about the message

212
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:33,999
that you're sending to make sure that you
don't make the same mistake in return.

213
00:19:36,179 --> 00:19:43,179
My third story is --> let me give you a little
background. I know a lot of people approach

214
00:19:43,489 --> 00:19:50,489
me outside of work and go hey, you know what's
going on. We're all owned. And these were

215
00:19:50,899 --> 00:19:56,119
large companies that are oftentimes funded
by taxpayer money. I'll just say it. They

216
00:19:56,119 --> 00:20:01,200
are large Government contracting organizations.
It's like hey, why don't you start a program

217
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:06,559
that actually pays us to go clean up the compromises,
or at least figure out what happened, and

218
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:13,559
how bad the damage was. I'm like isn't that
your job? And it made me think that there

219
00:20:16,349 --> 00:20:23,349
is actually --> there is not a financial incentive
for these companies to actually go fix the

220
00:20:23,859 --> 00:20:29,700
problems.
So the next question was is the inverse true?

221
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:34,320
Can Government contractors actually make more
money by remaining compromised and continuing

222
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:41,320
to lose intellectual property? So this talk
is called game theory is a bitch.

223
00:20:43,639 --> 00:20:48,639
I was having dinner with --> a lot of stories
are because I'm outside having dinner because

224
00:20:48,639 --> 00:20:54,450
I don't cook.
I was having dinner with an old friend and

225
00:20:54,450 --> 00:21:01,450
his company goes in and cleans up APT after
big well-known names get compromised, whether

226
00:21:02,419 --> 00:21:06,929
they're Government contractors or commercial
organizations. And he posed a really interesting

227
00:21:06,929 --> 00:21:11,789
hypothetical. Because we were just shooting
the crap back and forth. He said what do you

228
00:21:11,789 --> 00:21:18,789
think about the following chain of events?
First, RSA gets compromised. Networks defended

229
00:21:21,299 --> 00:21:28,299
by their tools are vulnerable and, as a result,
a defense contractor gets compromised. Said

230
00:21:29,259 --> 00:21:34,159
defense contractor, if you look up on Wikipedia,
is the one who made this really cool stealth

231
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:41,159
drone. Later a really cool stealth drone goes
missing over a Middle Eastern state. What

232
00:21:42,909 --> 00:21:47,399
do you think about that chain of events? And
I'm like that's terrifying. He is like yes.

233
00:21:47,399 --> 00:21:51,749
I'm like no. No. For an entirely different
reason.

234
00:21:51,749 --> 00:21:54,409
Look at it this way. I have no clue. That's
a hypothetical and there are a whole bunch

235
00:21:54,409 --> 00:22:01,409
of rumors about what had happened. Let's assume
that you as a country or a large organization

236
00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:07,289
that your advantage is technology. You can
field the fastest and the best technology

237
00:22:07,289 --> 00:22:11,210
so you're ahead of everybody. That's your
advantage.

238
00:22:11,210 --> 00:22:17,849
Newest most advanced toys. Someone else steals
some of your tech. What do you have to do?

239
00:22:17,849 --> 00:22:24,849
You've got to replace it with newer tech.
Right?You've got to keep your advantage.

240
00:22:25,169 --> 00:22:29,999
So suppose a Government contractor gets some
of the super tech stolen, and what does the

241
00:22:29,999 --> 00:22:35,200
Government customer actually need to do? Well,
the Government in that case --> and this is

242
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:40,169
a game theory hypothetical --> need to pay
someone to make the next version so that the

243
00:22:40,169 --> 00:22:46,049
people who just stole it don't achieve parity.
So that they're not even. They could go to

244
00:22:46,049 --> 00:22:51,739
some other Government contractor, because
of course the one in question just lost everything.

245
00:22:51,739 --> 00:22:57,859
But they actually most likely won't. And here's
probably why.

246
00:22:57,859 --> 00:23:04,859
The initial contract for very expensive research
efforts can take a long time to put in place.

247
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:11,059
You're talking over a year. Sometimes longer
than --> sometimes you measure it in years

248
00:23:11,059 --> 00:23:17,629
rather than months. That was part of the coolness
of CFT was that we were measuring that in

249
00:23:17,629 --> 00:23:22,659
days. Imagine if you're under something, sequestration
is what we're under now, it can take even

250
00:23:22,659 --> 00:23:27,940
longer. So if a Government agency wanted to
start a new program to replace tech, so it's

251
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:31,429
essentially starting the same program to do
the same thing that you already were paying

252
00:23:31,429 --> 00:23:36,499
somebody to do, A, it's tough to get permission
to do that. Because you've got to go justify

253
00:23:36,499 --> 00:23:41,629
taxpayer money and, well, we just gave you
the money to do that. And, B, when you spin

254
00:23:41,629 --> 00:23:45,249
it back up, you're going to have to redo a
lot of work. You're going to have to redo

255
00:23:45,249 --> 00:23:48,440
the contracting that you already had in place.
You're going to have to spin people up to

256
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:53,349
speed on management side. You're going to
have to respin up the tech side. And you've

257
00:23:53,349 --> 00:23:57,629
spent years putting that in place.
So why wouldn't you just go back to the people

258
00:23:57,629 --> 00:24:01,169
that you already have a relationship with,
already have a contract with, they already

259
00:24:01,169 --> 00:24:05,649
know what they lost, or maybe you know what
they lost and stuff, and you can tell them

260
00:24:05,649 --> 00:24:11,080
because they're your customer. So you can
pay them to do the next thing. Remember, they're

261
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:14,479
not financially incentivized to go fix how
they were actually compromised in the first

262
00:24:14,479 --> 00:24:19,519
place, or cleaning it up. Because staying
with the familiar solution or situation is

263
00:24:19,519 --> 00:24:24,710
comfortable, which makes it a trap that a
Government funding source can actually be

264
00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:29,869
particularly susceptible to.
You can view this on a case-by-case basis

265
00:24:29,869 --> 00:24:34,570
and kind of staying with the same contractor,
it can even make sense. But if you step back

266
00:24:34,570 --> 00:24:39,440
and listen to what has been talked about in
the media, you may see something that is a

267
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:44,649
larger picture that seems like an endless
list of technologies and IP being stolen.

268
00:24:44,649 --> 00:24:49,749
And each time it happens, that company is
in a situation where, A, there is really no

269
00:24:49,749 --> 00:24:56,749
penalties or reprimands for it. On the contrary,
they are rewarded with more funding.

270
00:24:58,009 --> 00:25:01,799
So because their customer needs to make the
next tech to replace the stuff that just got

271
00:25:01,799 --> 00:25:05,669
stolen, to replace the stuff that just got
stolen, to replace the stuff that just got

272
00:25:05,669 --> 00:25:11,249
stolen. So, yeah, game theory is a bitch because
if you look at it from this angle --> and part

273
00:25:11,249 --> 00:25:15,359
of the neat thing is you can fall into game
theoretics without realizing that you're doing

274
00:25:15,359 --> 00:25:20,809
it --> Government contractors can actually
be in a situation or are actually in a situation

275
00:25:20,809 --> 00:25:24,499
that they are financially incentivized in
some places not to listen to their network

276
00:25:24,499 --> 00:25:30,440
sys admins and not to really deal with the
problem perhaps the way with the drastic changes

277
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:37,440
that need to be made.
The fourth and kind of closing story, and

278
00:25:40,469 --> 00:25:46,580
maybe I'll do a fifth story about Barnaby
Jack and Abu Dhabi. Yeah, I think I'll do

279
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:53,580
that.
I mention Barnaby Jack and I get all teary.

280
00:25:55,099 --> 00:26:01,119
Yeah, maybe I just stick with the fourth story,
then.

281
00:26:01,119 --> 00:26:05,320
The fourth story, closing, is more of a kind
of plea to both the Government communities

282
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:09,979
and the hacker researcher communities, because
from the vantage point of both. I don't have

283
00:26:09,979 --> 00:26:15,989
a lot of examples of our community, the hacker
researcher community, really reaching out

284
00:26:15,989 --> 00:26:21,820
in a proactive and positive way to educate
and enlighten the Government. We do it, but

285
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:28,820
we do it really ad hoc. And I think we need
to try a little harder to do specific examples.

286
00:26:29,139 --> 00:26:34,200
I've been a little upset about some of the
things on the news lately. And, actually,

287
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:39,090
one of your options, it is a scary option,
is to actually go inside and try and fix them

288
00:26:39,090 --> 00:26:44,070
there. People will fight you tooth and nail.
It is not for the faint of heart. But that's

289
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:48,119
actually what I did when I went over to DARPA.
I didn't go there because I thought it was

290
00:26:48,119 --> 00:26:52,009
cool. I didn't go there because I wanted to
be a part of the Government. I actually went

291
00:26:52,009 --> 00:26:57,399
there because I thought that they and other
parts of the Government had kind of lost their

292
00:26:57,399 --> 00:27:00,899
way. And I had an opportunity to go in and
fix it.

293
00:27:00,899 --> 00:27:07,070
I did get a really nice unofficial e-mail
from somebody recently and it was about CFT,

294
00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:11,989
which makes me think that we actually, because
you guys were all a big part of that, did

295
00:27:11,989 --> 00:27:17,450
manage to pull some of that off. So I'm going
to quote from this e-mail I got to my personal

296
00:27:17,450 --> 00:27:24,190
account. And the person said "I recently had
a meeting with all the agencies, and the DoD

297
00:27:24,190 --> 00:27:29,219
services, and listening to them it was my
turn to be terrified because of how out of

298
00:27:29,219 --> 00:27:34,259
touch with reality they were with cyber security
and cyber defenses, and it made me realize

299
00:27:34,259 --> 00:27:40,039
how much I and the DoD owe you" and that's
us "for cyber fast track." And here is the

300
00:27:40,039 --> 00:27:45,089
part where I was happy. He said "I thought
CFT was showing the Government how they should

301
00:27:45,089 --> 00:27:50,659
be doing contracting. But now I actually understand
what you were doing. It was showing the Government

302
00:27:50,659 --> 00:27:55,159
what the real state-of-the-art is and why
they should be afraid of people on the inside

303
00:27:55,159 --> 00:28:00,549
who continue to just preach the status quo
and throw money at the same problems the same

304
00:28:00,549 --> 00:28:04,279
way they had done before.
So that was actually pretty cool, because

305
00:28:04,279 --> 00:28:09,149
somebody --> they're starting to realize that.
And I've heard people at high levels, flag

306
00:28:09,149 --> 00:28:15,080
officers, a couple pockets were starting to
refer to hacker researchers as researchers.

307
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:19,320
It was hacker equals researcher, not hacker
equals criminal. I thought that was really

308
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:23,669
cool. It's not saying that we should all go
in and support the DoD and I'm not telling

309
00:28:23,669 --> 00:28:28,799
you you should like the DoD. I've got a lot
of issues with the DoD, and I'll continue,

310
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:34,529
and I'm sure they have a lot of issues with
me. This talk might even be one of them.

311
00:28:34,529 --> 00:28:38,009
But what happens there is now that they know
where some of the real ideas and some of the

312
00:28:38,009 --> 00:28:43,249
real talent come from, they're undoubtedly
going to reach out and try to tap into it

313
00:28:43,249 --> 00:28:47,399
in various ways. And this kind of goes back
to an earlier story where they kind of projected

314
00:28:47,399 --> 00:28:51,450
their problems and their images and their
goals on somebody else. So there is likely

315
00:28:51,450 --> 00:28:58,450
to be some uninformed and failed outreach
efforts. So I've got a couple of recommendations

316
00:28:58,729 --> 00:29:02,679
to the Government that maybe will help with
that.

317
00:29:02,679 --> 00:29:08,719
So I think it's really cool when Government
officials throw on blue jeans and a black

318
00:29:08,719 --> 00:29:13,129
T-shirt, because of course then they're part
of our community.

319
00:29:13,129 --> 00:29:17,639
(Laughter)
But that's not necessarily all there is to

320
00:29:17,639 --> 00:29:23,719
interacting with us. And it makes sense before
you present at a conference like this, that

321
00:29:23,719 --> 00:29:27,639
you should probably consider attending one
and actually interacting and getting to know

322
00:29:27,639 --> 00:29:33,229
the people. There was one guy who was a three-star
general who did that at the Shmoocon, and

323
00:29:33,229 --> 00:29:36,529
I thought that that was one of the coolest
things. He wasn't there for any agenda. And

324
00:29:36,529 --> 00:29:40,619
I remember conversations with him afterwards.
He actually had an understanding. He was like

325
00:29:40,619 --> 00:29:44,379
oh, this is awesome. No, there is no way people
should try and go in and mess with them or

326
00:29:44,379 --> 00:29:49,109
try and co-op them or try and --> and I was
like yeah, exactly. That's us. That's the

327
00:29:49,109 --> 00:29:56,109
citizens. That's the population of the U.S.
So the message to the other ones who haven't

328
00:29:56,619 --> 00:30:03,619
really made that turn is go and actually interact.
Now the response I'd get was the schedule

329
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:10,899
is too crazy. Can't possibly do it. And I
saw those schedules, and sometimes I was even

330
00:30:10,899 --> 00:30:15,799
on those schedules. But if it's important
enough --> I know, I acknowledge, they are

331
00:30:15,799 --> 00:30:22,059
crazy schedules. These guys work like bears,
which doesn't mean that they sleep for half

332
00:30:22,059 --> 00:30:22,549
the year.
(Laughter)

333
00:30:22,549 --> 00:30:28,249
A bad analogy as soon as I said it. I was
going to say like a swear word, and bears

334
00:30:28,249 --> 00:30:33,639
came out instead. Anyway.
If it's important enough for you to want to

335
00:30:33,639 --> 00:30:37,119
reach out to a community, you've got to go
out and you've got to make the effort and

336
00:30:37,119 --> 00:30:40,059
you've got to put it in your schedule and
you've got to go interact with them on a one-on-one

337
00:30:40,059 --> 00:30:46,669
level first. Because that showing your homework
and doing your homework shows respect.

338
00:30:46,669 --> 00:30:52,450
The next suggestion to them is, and this is
what I tried to encourage inside, is you can't

339
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:57,200
go out and do a recruiting pitch. Because
it comes across really poorly. I used to get

340
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:03,899
so bent out of shape when I would see a Govie
stand up at a hacker conference and I'm like

341
00:31:03,899 --> 00:31:09,179
here it comes. We do awesome stuff, but I
can't tell you anything about it. Trust us.

342
00:31:09,179 --> 00:31:14,119
You with the mohawk, if you shaved your hair,
if you put on a suit and maybe even a uniform,

343
00:31:14,119 --> 00:31:16,759
stopped smoking dope, you could come work
for us and actually do something with your

344
00:31:16,759 --> 00:31:22,429
life. That's how I interpreted it. Now that
might not be the message. It might just be

345
00:31:22,429 --> 00:31:26,589
a look, you know, we need help and we're trying
to reach out to you. But it's just a take,

346
00:31:26,589 --> 00:31:29,950
take, take sort of message. What can you do
for us today? You know, what can you do for

347
00:31:29,950 --> 00:31:36,950
us now? And to me it was offensive.
What would it be like if you had a senior

348
00:31:39,499 --> 00:31:46,499
official from a very technical agency come
out and actually give a technical talk? Because

349
00:31:46,899 --> 00:31:52,330
this is Ameritocracy. That's where this community
came from. Ameritocricy is your value in the

350
00:31:52,330 --> 00:31:56,959
community is based upon how much you contribute
to that community. And that's one of the reasons

351
00:31:56,959 --> 00:32:01,209
why I was really happy that --> because I know
a lot of people are like why the hell did

352
00:32:01,209 --> 00:32:06,070
Mudge go over and go to the DoD? He was one
of us and now he's one of them. And I had

353
00:32:06,070 --> 00:32:12,089
spent 15, 20 years contributing to this community,
and I wasn't about to stop. And when I was

354
00:32:12,089 --> 00:32:16,639
there, I was able to actually fight for this
community and try and make sure that the interactions

355
00:32:16,639 --> 00:32:22,709
were a little bit better and that we were
treated and engaged with normally. And those

356
00:32:22,709 --> 00:32:28,979
10, 15 years of contribution gave me enough
grace period to build trust up again on both

357
00:32:28,979 --> 00:32:32,179
sides.
And you've got to do that and you do that

358
00:32:32,179 --> 00:32:36,080
by interacting with people. So the value of
somebody in one of those agencies coming and

359
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:41,009
giving a technical talk wouldn't be that you
learned something really cool about how SE

360
00:32:41,009 --> 00:32:45,029
Linux was actually done and why it was done.
Or what the internal battles were to get it

361
00:32:45,029 --> 00:32:49,029
across. It wouldn't be that somebody is going
through the technical components of one of

362
00:32:49,029 --> 00:32:54,359
the numerous patents that are out there, you
know, let's say the IPGLO location. You know,

363
00:32:54,359 --> 00:33:00,479
the ones that we've read about. It would actually
be that they're engaging us and interacting

364
00:33:00,479 --> 00:33:07,479
with us in our own language and treating us
as peers and starting a dialog.

365
00:33:08,039 --> 00:33:12,700
So I think I will give the Barnaby one after
this. But I'm summarize this one here.

366
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:19,049
Am I telling us --> you know, am I pleading
that we should not challenge the Government?

367
00:33:19,049 --> 00:33:22,830
Absolutely not. I think challenging the Government
is your patriotic duty as a citizen and I

368
00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:27,609
think it is very important to do. It's painful
for both sides, but it's something that has

369
00:33:27,609 --> 00:33:34,609
to happen and it's why we're such a great
nation.

370
00:33:35,159 --> 00:33:42,159
(Applause)
We also need to --> I mean, you can't train

371
00:33:44,989 --> 00:33:48,789
a dog just by repeatedly beating it. I mean,
it will learn some stuff, but it will probably

372
00:33:48,789 --> 00:33:53,409
learn stuff that you weren't intending and
it will bite you at some point. So when you

373
00:33:53,409 --> 00:33:58,009
see the dog do something good, it's nice to
give it a treat, and there are certain little

374
00:33:58,009 --> 00:34:02,099
pockets inside the Government. And one of
the things that I think that we as a community

375
00:34:02,099 --> 00:34:06,379
can do better is, yes, we need to challenge
the stuff that we're seeing. We need to challenge

376
00:34:06,379 --> 00:34:10,309
the things that are in the news. But if you
see a small pocket of hope, like if you see

377
00:34:10,309 --> 00:34:17,309
a Congresswoman that is helping put through
Erin's law, you know --> 
changing things like CFAA. I don't deal with

378
00:34:35,619 --> 00:34:42,619
losing people well. Excuse me.
Somebody is going to change CFAA, we need

379
00:34:54,799 --> 00:35:00,260
to support them. We need to help them. We
need to encourage them for actually going,

380
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:04,230
because they're going to get a lot of crap
thrown at them. And they're actually doing

381
00:35:04,230 --> 00:35:07,559
the right thing and there is not a lot of
people supporting them. So we need to be more

382
00:35:07,559 --> 00:35:14,559
vocal as a community to actually support them.
There was a Colonel in the Army who managed

383
00:35:14,559 --> 00:35:20,750
to get the NSA to have to include "Little
Brother" as a book that they read as part

384
00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:26,769
of their training. Have you read "Little Brother,"
Cory Doctorow? That's awesome. That helps

385
00:35:26,769 --> 00:35:32,880
sensitivities. That guy caught a lot of crap
for that, and it was really cool. I mean,

386
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:36,710
there is nothing wrong with that book. That
book gives you a new way of looking at things.

387
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:39,900
And the more ways you have of looking at it,
the more understanding you have and the more

388
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:43,980
positive outcome.
That guy is also, I say he is a Colonel. He

389
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:48,130
is over at West Point. His name is Greg Conti.
I'll call him out. He was one of the people

390
00:35:48,130 --> 00:35:51,730
who encouraged the cadets to actually go out
and talk at our conferences and contribute

391
00:35:51,730 --> 00:35:58,730
to the UA --> build your own UAV at a 99.99
percent discount by Mike Wiegand was an example

392
00:35:59,430 --> 00:36:05,789
of that. And it's engaging and that's actually
sharing in a creative dialog at Schmoocon.

393
00:36:05,789 --> 00:36:12,789
He and his colleague walked through their
training course that they ran at Fort Meade,

394
00:36:13,029 --> 00:36:17,950
to try and socialize folks. It was lessons
of the Kobayashi Maru. I highly recommend

395
00:36:17,950 --> 00:36:24,920
you go watch this talk. Because he had to
teach them how to cheat. And it's hilarious

396
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:31,920
and it's insightful and it's humanizing. Most
importantly, it's humanizing.

397
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:39,180
So where we see those pockets of hope and
of outreach and of engagement, I'd just really

398
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:43,220
like to ask all of us to try and figure out
a way for each time we're challenging something,

399
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:45,460
we really have to try and encourage the good
behavior.

400
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:52,349
Okay, so let me try to give my Barnaby one
without breaking down into tears here. Let's

401
00:36:52,349 --> 00:36:58,210
see if I pulled myself together. It's a real
quick one, but it's my tribute to him.

402
00:36:58,210 --> 00:37:03,480
Two things that happened in our actions with
Barnaby that I'll always remember. I remember

403
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:09,750
all of the interactions, but two stand out.
One was a talk. I was on the steering committee

404
00:37:09,750 --> 00:37:14,710
of NDSS, and they asked me if I could bring
in some folks to run some demos that would

405
00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:20,420
kind of break the academics out of the academic
mold, and you know what better people than

406
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:24,990
Barnaby Jack when he was working with EI and
the rest of the EI team to actually come in.

407
00:37:24,990 --> 00:37:29,539
The problem is that the conference, like a
lot of conferences, they were cheap. They

408
00:37:29,539 --> 00:37:33,269
wouldn't pay them to come do the work, or
whatever. So I said all right, guys, you know,

409
00:37:33,269 --> 00:37:38,220
the drinking bill the night before is on me.
I'll foot the bill myself, which is a very,

410
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:43,640
very dangerous thing to do.
Barnaby had a great time. I don't think they

411
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:49,720
went to sleep, they just kept drinking. They
were on in the morning, and the audience at

412
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:55,710
NDSS I don't think actually really understood
how cool the technology was that was being

413
00:37:55,710 --> 00:37:59,910
demonstrated. Because this is almost ten years
ago, at this point.

414
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:04,609
And Barnaby was remotely compromising a wireless
router, replacing the firmware and then Trojaning

415
00:38:04,609 --> 00:38:07,700
the Microsoft updates that were going through
it over the wire before they were delivered

416
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:14,700
to the end system. And then they demonstrating
a boot route, where they were getting an Ethernet

417
00:38:15,099 --> 00:38:20,760
-- so a computer that was told not to boot
off the network, the Ethernet adapter was

418
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:27,760
on the PCI board so it had direct memory access
and it would still emit a boot P packet. And

419
00:38:28,690 --> 00:38:32,460
if you responded to it, the Ethernet board
would actually shove it directly in memory

420
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:37,910
and reboot it from the network even if your
BIOS didn't have that capability.

421
00:38:37,910 --> 00:38:43,079
So of course they would say here is your base
operating system. It has a little hypervisor,

422
00:38:43,079 --> 00:38:46,089
and of course the operating system would load
up on top of it. This was a decade ago. This

423
00:38:46,089 --> 00:38:48,990
was awesome.
And the reason why I don't think any of the

424
00:38:48,990 --> 00:38:54,359
audience actually caught the technical part
of those talks is because Barnaby nearly threw

425
00:38:54,359 --> 00:38:59,019
up on stage ten times in the middle of trying
to give that talk, and everybody in the first

426
00:38:59,019 --> 00:39:04,430
row was terrified that they were at some perverse
form of a Gallagher hacker show.

427
00:39:04,430 --> 00:39:09,450
(Laughter)
And then the other thing I remember about

428
00:39:09,450 --> 00:39:16,450
Barnaby was I had just gone in and I was working
for DARPA. And my first public speaking engagement

429
00:39:20,010 --> 00:39:27,010
as a U.S. Official was in Abu Dhabi. So here
I am, first time, the Government is a little

430
00:39:29,369 --> 00:39:33,940
nervous about me, I'm a little nervous about
them. I'm flying under my Government official

431
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:40,170
passport, not my blue tourist passport. So
all the coordination between the countries

432
00:39:40,170 --> 00:39:44,769
that I imagine has to go on with those folks,
and I'm in Abu Adbi and it was actually to

433
00:39:44,769 --> 00:39:48,980
do the keynote for Black Hat. It was the first
year they were over there. And it was the

434
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:55,720
first time ever that I was showing parts of
the cyber analytic framework that I drove

435
00:39:55,720 --> 00:40:00,519
at DARPA. And it was my way of trying to get
a small group of peers that I could interact

436
00:40:00,519 --> 00:40:05,400
with and get feedback and just talk honestly,
you know, does this make sense or am I full

437
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:09,470
of crap?
And Barnaby was there and the Gruck is there.

438
00:40:09,470 --> 00:40:15,900
And those are two people that put together,
that will deplete the world's alcohol supplies.

439
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:21,849
And he was doing his jackpoting ATM machines.
Now the UAE has a lot of money they've come

440
00:40:21,849 --> 00:40:28,849
into since the '70s. And in the palace there
is an ATM machine that dispenses gold bars.

441
00:40:31,170 --> 00:40:35,349
(Laughter)
Very expensive gold bars. Not like you've

442
00:40:35,349 --> 00:40:40,380
got a $200 withdrawal limit. I mean, these
are in the tens if not hundreds, I can't remember

443
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:43,859
how high up the price was. There might have
been the ability to withdraw a million dollar

444
00:40:43,859 --> 00:40:49,039
gold bar from it. And some of you might have
seen the picture of Barnaby going like that

445
00:40:49,039 --> 00:40:54,869
right next to the thing.
So Barnaby's had a few drinks and they see

446
00:40:54,869 --> 00:41:01,869
the gold ATM machine. So how do you think
it works? And they are peering behind it and

447
00:41:03,069 --> 00:41:09,230
everything. And the folks who are --> I think
it's the son or one of the relatives of the

448
00:41:09,230 --> 00:41:16,230
Crown Prince, who I knew from a prior life,
was looking at me going what's going on? And

449
00:41:17,099 --> 00:41:22,809
they're all starting to gather around the
gold ATM. And I forget who it was that tweeted

450
00:41:22,809 --> 00:41:27,830
and said I remember Barnaby in the UAE and
having to go to the State Department to basically

451
00:41:27,830 --> 00:41:32,349
-- or the embassy, calling the embassy to
make sure everything was okay.

452
00:41:32,349 --> 00:41:39,119
So it wasn't the embassy, it was me, having
to go over, talk to, you know, people who

453
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:43,789
are part of the court of the Crown Prince
and explaining: No, I know you're not used

454
00:41:43,789 --> 00:41:48,490
to extremely heavy drinkers, and you just
invited a bunch of hackers into your country,

455
00:41:48,490 --> 00:41:51,690
and they've demonstrated a bunch of crazy
terrifying things, and now they're eying your

456
00:41:51,690 --> 00:41:57,369
million dollar gold vending machine.
(Laughter)

457
00:41:57,369 --> 00:42:01,099
It's Barnaby Jack. He's cool. Don't worry
about it. I'll tell you what, you probably

458
00:42:01,099 --> 00:42:05,980
want to know if your million dollar gold vending
machine has this problem. So why don't you

459
00:42:05,980 --> 00:42:10,539
let him do a little bit, and then when they
walk away, why don't you pull the plug on

460
00:42:10,539 --> 00:42:15,680
the thing and then move it off the floor.
Sure enough, everybody got a little tired.

461
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:18,630
Because of course there's some research that
has to go into these things, and the alcohol

462
00:42:18,630 --> 00:42:24,960
fueling only lasts so long. And when somebody
got a little tired and decided to walk away,

463
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:28,640
the next day you see there's this big curtain
pulled around everything and nobody is allowed

464
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:34,099
near the thing. So there was no reach out
to the embassy and there was no international

465
00:42:34,099 --> 00:42:38,920
incident. But there was Barnaby Jack, and
he will be missed.

466
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:39,650
Thank you.
(Applause)

467
00:42:39,650 --> 00:42:46,650
 You can't go anywhere. So I'm joined up
here by just a very small subset of the CFT

468
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:11,900
performers that were involved with Mudge's
DARPA program, cyber fast track. So we want

469
00:43:12,589 --> 00:43:19,589
to take the opportunity --> hold on a second.
(Applause)

470
00:43:20,670 --> 00:43:27,670
We really just want to get up here and thank
Mudge for all of his efforts inside DARPA

471
00:43:36,460 --> 00:43:41,390
with this program. We all had a lot of fun.
You've seen some of the research that's come

472
00:43:41,390 --> 00:43:45,319
out of it at DEF CON and Black Hat and there
will only be more that's coming out soon.

473
00:43:45,319 --> 00:43:50,339
But we also wanted to thank him for his entire
career from LOpht to DARPA and now onwards

474
00:43:50,339 --> 00:43:55,279
to Google. I'm sure there's many more interesting
things to come. So please give your strongest

475
00:43:55,279 --> 00:44:02,279
round of applause for Mudge and everything
he's done for the cyber community.

476
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:09,680
(Applause)
There's more. Don't go anywhere yet. We're

477
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:20,240
not done.
So what we didn't mention is hopefully --> I'm

478
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:23,490
going to say a few things about Mudge and
hopefully some other people who participated

479
00:44:23,490 --> 00:44:29,670
in CFT will as well.
My name is Joe Grand and I've known Mudge

480
00:44:29,670 --> 00:44:36,670
for a really long time. I was in the LOpht
back in I guess we met in 1990, I was like

481
00:44:38,430 --> 00:44:45,000
a 15-year-old punk little kid. And ended up
getting in trouble for some things, joined

482
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:51,549
the LOpht, and Mudge came in around the same
time. And he --> I don't know if I ever told

483
00:44:51,549 --> 00:44:56,130
him this, but he was one of my mentors growing
up. From that point as a 16-year-old kid,

484
00:44:56,130 --> 00:45:01,170
everybody else in the LOpht was older. I sort
of got to see the experience of somebody that

485
00:45:01,170 --> 00:45:06,480
was like six or eight, twenty years older
than me. I don't exactly know. He never actually

486
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:08,440
told me his age.
(Laughter)

487
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:13,569
But it was something that I got to follow
along. I was in the LOpht and it was a great

488
00:45:13,569 --> 00:45:20,569
experience. And I sort of grew up in that
from 16 to 22. After we started that stake,

489
00:45:21,359 --> 00:45:25,299
you know we sort of disappeared for a while.
Mudge went one way, I went another. Some of

490
00:45:25,299 --> 00:45:31,589
the other guys just sort of disappeared.
And then he sort of surfaced I guess 2008

491
00:45:31,589 --> 00:45:37,529
or '9, and it was like all of a sudden Mudge
is back and he's in DARPA. And I was like

492
00:45:37,529 --> 00:45:43,980
holy shit. Mudge is back. And he's working
for "the man."

493
00:45:43,980 --> 00:45:47,299
(Laughter)
And here I was, grew up with him in the LOpht,

494
00:45:47,299 --> 00:45:54,099
and there is a lot of stuff in the LOpht that
you guys don't know. And it was awesome. And

495
00:45:54,099 --> 00:45:58,839
yeah, I didn't really know what to think.
I was still involved in DEF CON and the hacker

496
00:45:58,839 --> 00:46:03,000
community. It was just --> to me, seeing that,
it was like wow, that was a big jump, and

497
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:07,569
that takes some serious balls to do that.
And I could never imagine doing that. And

498
00:46:07,569 --> 00:46:12,059
I think everyone was like what's going to
happen? What's he actually going to do out

499
00:46:12,059 --> 00:46:16,480
there?
It turned out to be an amazing thing. CFT

500
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:21,579
happened and a huge number of my friends ended
up doing all these projects. Charlie Miller

501
00:46:21,579 --> 00:46:26,309
had two projects in CFT, and I was like how
is everybody doing all this stuff? I was like

502
00:46:26,309 --> 00:46:30,869
I want to do a project with CFT. I was running
with Charlie one day and he was like yeah,

503
00:46:30,869 --> 00:46:37,069
you should do it. Mudge has this whole thing
wrapped up. You just write a proposal and

504
00:46:37,069 --> 00:46:40,559
he reads it and if it gets approved they send
you money and you can work on stuff. I'm like

505
00:46:40,559 --> 00:46:43,690
really, is it that easy? He's like yeah, do
it.

506
00:46:43,690 --> 00:46:49,920
So that was last year. I was like I don't
know, do I want to work for Mudge again? Like

507
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:54,019
that's going to be really weird. Like we were
in the L0pht and I don't want him to be my

508
00:46:54,019 --> 00:46:57,230
boss. Really, this was his huge complaint.
It's like they'll give you money. I was like

509
00:46:57,230 --> 00:47:02,910
I don't want to work for Mudge. But he's like
it's Not working for Mudge, you know some

510
00:47:02,910 --> 00:47:06,130
other group takes care of it.
So I'm like all right, cool. And I thought

511
00:47:06,130 --> 00:47:12,519
it was just a great thing that he was doing.
So I submitted a project that got rejected.

512
00:47:12,519 --> 00:47:17,210
And I'm not sure I'm allowed to say this because
I don't know if it was part of the official

513
00:47:17,210 --> 00:47:22,089
process, but he called me up. Like I submitted
the official proposal and like 15 inutes later

514
00:47:22,089 --> 00:47:26,009
he calls me. He said I need to talk to you
in person about this. I don't need to send

515
00:47:26,009 --> 00:47:31,099
you an e-mail. So he explained the process.
I said all right. That's cool. Too much engineering,

516
00:47:31,099 --> 00:47:35,410
whatever. It didn't fit the DARPA thing, the
CFT thing. I'm like okay, that's fine.

517
00:47:35,410 --> 00:47:39,990
But it drove me to like --> it's like I've
got to get a CFT in. All my friends are doing

518
00:47:39,990 --> 00:47:41,509
it, it's
like I've got to take advantage of this while

519
00:47:41,509 --> 00:47:47,799
I can, man, before it goes away.
So eventually I got one in and I'm still working

520
00:47:47,799 --> 00:47:54,799
on it right now. And it occurred to me that
it's not that you can like --> you're doing

521
00:47:55,240 --> 00:47:59,680
this project to make money. Right? You're
not doing a job to make money. It's the fact

522
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:05,019
that you're able to get money to do what you
want to do. And, you know, it's --> you do

523
00:48:05,019 --> 00:48:08,839
it --> you do what you love to do and you're
not losing money is sort of what it is. And

524
00:48:08,839 --> 00:48:12,470
that's sort of what we try to do at the LOpht.
It's like do what we want to do and not lose

525
00:48:12,470 --> 00:48:15,119
money, but make sure that we can keep kind
of pushing things.

526
00:48:15,119 --> 00:48:17,650
So I don't know, I just wanted to say that.
I don't know if you notice on the back --> can

527
00:48:17,650 --> 00:48:21,809
someone turn around? On the back of these
shirts it says "making the theoretical, practical,

528
00:48:21,809 --> 00:48:22,769
since 1992."
(Applause)

529
00:48:22,769 --> 00:48:29,769
And I don't know how we came up with that,
but that was one quote that we talked about,

530
00:48:31,390 --> 00:48:35,749
writing exploits and kind of showing vendors,
like look, this is a possibility. But the

531
00:48:35,749 --> 00:48:40,499
one that isn't on the back of this shirt is
what we always used to say about making a

532
00:48:40,499 --> 00:48:44,359
dent in the universe when we were at the LOpht.
I think Mudge actually came up with that.

533
00:48:44,359 --> 00:48:49,019
So we would be in interviews and news stuff
and press, and Mudge would say we're going

534
00:48:49,019 --> 00:48:52,619
to make a dent in the universe. And I was
like yeah yeah yeah, you know. I said it,

535
00:48:52,619 --> 00:48:57,309
but I was like that's total bullshit. How
are we going to make a dent in the universe,

536
00:48:57,309 --> 00:49:01,880
we're are seven guys with --> you know, he
had long hair, as you know. And seven guys

537
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:05,130
in a warehouse, it's like how are we going
to actually make a dent in the universe?

538
00:49:05,130 --> 00:49:08,019
Although the hacker community, is like a small
-- that's not the universe. It's a small universer

539
00:49:08,019 --> 00:49:12,200
but it's not the universe. But he actually
believed it.

540
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:15,319
You know, and I was sort of like --> yeah,
I was going along with it. But he believed

541
00:49:15,319 --> 00:49:19,900
it, and it didn't actually hit me until he
got to DARPA and did CFT, and I was like holy

542
00:49:19,900 --> 00:49:24,920
shit, he did make a dent in the universe.
You know? It's like that --> the work the he

543
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:29,609
did and the work that came out of CFT totally
changed the world, whether it's immediate

544
00:49:29,609 --> 00:49:33,029
or whether it's later. It changed the Government,
it changed the thought process, it's amazing.

545
00:49:33,029 --> 00:49:38,309
So I just wanted to thank him and welcome
him back out of working for "the man" back

546
00:49:38,309 --> 00:49:44,980
into like the normal world. So thanks.
(Applause)

547
00:49:44,980 --> 00:49:51,980
 I do also have to say that Charlie is responsible
for probably 70 percent of the CFTs that were

548
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:58,109
submitted. I had a similar phone call with
him, I don't know, a couple years back. I

549
00:49:58,109 --> 00:50:04,059
remember distinctly. And people have a very
interesting opinion of what it's like to participate

550
00:50:04,059 --> 00:50:10,049
in any sort of DARPA or government grant.
And speaking with Charlie and learning about

551
00:50:10,049 --> 00:50:17,049
the streamline process and the kind of low
overhead it takes to get a grant through and

552
00:50:17,059 --> 00:50:22,119
actually get funding to, again, do what you
want to do was very attractive. So I think

553
00:50:22,119 --> 00:50:26,809
this program itself was wildly successful
alone. But I think it also changed a lot of

554
00:50:26,809 --> 00:50:31,299
our personal views about dealing with the
Government, and I hope that can continue with

555
00:50:31,299 --> 00:50:34,990
CFT with the next program manager.
I would also say that bitsys --> are there

556
00:50:34,990 --> 00:50:40,660
any other bitsys guys up here? So bitsys helped
run the program for DARPA.

557
00:50:40,660 --> 00:50:45,109
(Applause)
So we will give them a round of applause ourselves

558
00:50:45,109 --> 00:50:52,109
because they are great to work with.
 You know, I hadn't registered for DEF CON

559
00:50:53,430 --> 00:50:59,710
in over 20 years, which brings some perspective.
And I've known this guy for a very, very,

560
00:50:59,710 --> 00:51:06,109
very long time, and he always wanted to be
something greater than the average bear and

561
00:51:06,109 --> 00:51:10,049
to change things.
And I don't know if he would mind me saying

562
00:51:10,049 --> 00:51:16,759
this, but I'll say it anyway, back in the
day, when his hunger was great, he asked me

563
00:51:16,759 --> 00:51:22,880
to take over the LOpht, which was probably
a bad idea for a variety of reasons. But I

564
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:29,880
had faith in him that he is going to figure
it out. And he did. And I've worked for him

565
00:51:29,940 --> 00:51:35,890
now for the last couple years. And, unfortunately,
I had been fired by him because the program

566
00:51:35,890 --> 00:51:42,529
is ending. But congratulations, guy, you really
did good.

567
00:51:42,529 --> 00:51:45,490
 Thanks, Dan.
 Thank you.

568
00:51:45,490 --> 00:51:52,140
(Applause).
 I just want to say something super quick.

569
00:51:52,140 --> 00:51:57,410
We're hackers, and we're individualists, and
we hate anyone speaking for us. But Mudge

570
00:51:57,410 --> 00:52:01,170
is pretty much the only guy that I'll let
speak for me any time he wants.

571
00:52:01,170 --> 00:52:01,759
(Applause)
(End of session)
