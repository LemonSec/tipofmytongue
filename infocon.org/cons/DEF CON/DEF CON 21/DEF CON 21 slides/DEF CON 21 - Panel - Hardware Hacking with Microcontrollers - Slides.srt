00:00:05,125 --> 00:00:06,834
Hardware hacking with microcontrollers: A

2
00:00:06,834 --> 00:00:08,334
panel discussion.

3
00:00:08,334 --> 00:00:11,999
Moderating this panel and introduction to micro controllers and it seems

4
00:00:11,999 --> 00:00:15,000
like every seat is filled here.

5
00:00:17,626 --> 00:00:19,375
Pressure is on.

6
00:00:19,584 --> 00:00:22,667
I mean, I'm not wearing pants so this gets more interesting.

7
00:00:22,999 --> 00:00:27,292
And your crotch is right at the level of Joe's giant red fist.

8
00:00:29,876 --> 00:00:31,375
Excuse me a moment.

9
00:00:31,584 --> 00:00:33,584
It's going to be one of those panels.

10
00:00:33,584 --> 00:00:34,999
You don't want to know what's going

11
00:00:34,999 --> 00:00:37,083
on behind the podium.

12
00:00:37,667 --> 00:00:41,584
On my left we have FirmWarez.

13
00:00:43,751 --> 00:00:47,209
We have LosT who everybody should know.

14
00:00:47,209 --> 00:00:50,876
And I have a personal grudge against for number of years

15
00:00:50,876 --> 00:00:54,334
of mystery torture challenge, Smitty Halibut

16
00:00:54,334 --> 00:00:59,834
on the end and custom made hat and vest and Joe Grand.

17
00:00:59,834 --> 00:01:02,083
I'd like to correct that RenderMan.

18
00:01:02,083 --> 00:01:03,417
That's TV's Joe Grand.

19
00:01:05,542 --> 00:01:07,083
Discovery channel.

20
00:01:07,083 --> 00:01:08,999
Please, no applause, please.

21
00:01:09,792 --> 00:01:14,083
So we're basically here talking microcontrollers.

22
00:01:14,709 --> 00:01:17,999
I'm elated because I get to pick these guys' brains

23
00:01:17,999 --> 00:01:20,083
for an hour here.

24
00:01:20,083 --> 00:01:23,792
That's something I would have killed for at any other time.

25
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:27,999
So basically, we're just going to go down and just sort

26
00:01:27,999 --> 00:01:30,999
of have everybody sort of introduce how they got

27
00:01:30,999 --> 00:01:34,709
into micros and just sort of their history.

28
00:01:34,792 --> 00:01:36,375
And we'll go from there.

29
00:01:36,999 --> 00:01:38,125
So FirmWarez.

30
00:01:38,125 --> 00:01:40,083
I started hacking code on an ATH800B.

31
00:01:40,626 --> 00:01:43,751
And a lot of you guys loved writing software

32
00:01:43,751 --> 00:01:47,918
but I wanted to do hardware stuff but I ended up in the day

33
00:01:47,918 --> 00:01:51,999
of 8051 microcontrollers and that was all for fun and ended

34
00:01:51,999 --> 00:01:56,083
up being an embedded systems near making my way to being VT

35
00:01:56,083 --> 00:02:00,959
for contract design house I love making hardware that does something

36
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:05,292
and some of it has blown stuff up and some helped people live so

37
00:02:05,292 --> 00:02:07,375
a good balance.

38
00:02:12,459 --> 00:02:15,083
A 50/50 there.

39
00:02:15,083 --> 00:02:16,999
First foray was Motorola.

40
00:02:20,417 --> 00:02:22,999
We just dated ourselves, right.

41
00:02:22,999 --> 00:02:23,999
'80s called.

42
00:02:23,999 --> 00:02:27,250
They want their street cred back.

43
00:02:28,999 --> 00:02:31,999
I've just always been interested in how things work not just electronics

44
00:02:31,999 --> 00:02:33,999
but just things in general.

45
00:02:34,542 --> 00:02:36,292
I was always taking stuff apart and occasionally being able

46
00:02:36,292 --> 00:02:38,209
to put it back together.

47
00:02:38,209 --> 00:02:42,959
Usually things hacked to have different functionality.

48
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:44,876
I've had numerous jobs over the years.

49
00:02:44,876 --> 00:02:47,334
I've worked for Parallax, I worked as a design consultant

50
00:02:47,334 --> 00:02:51,167
for companies doing embedded systems and specifically embedded

51
00:02:51,167 --> 00:02:55,709
systems security because that's where my interests lie.

52
00:02:56,999 --> 00:02:59,999
And you have experience with badge design.

53
00:02:59,999 --> 00:03:01,292
A little.

54
00:03:02,417 --> 00:03:05,918
Not as much as Joe.

55
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:08,918
Yeah, so I'm Joe Grand.

56
00:03:08,999 --> 00:03:10,626
TV's Joe Grand.

57
00:03:10,626 --> 00:03:14,999
JOE GRAND: Thank you.

58
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:22,918
I got started with computer in 1982 with Atari 300.

59
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:25,876
My brother was interested in this stuff and

60
00:03:25,876 --> 00:03:29,250
he threw electronics and tools at me.

61
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:32,999
Didn't literally hit me but I was exposed to a lot

62
00:03:32,999 --> 00:03:37,375
of electronics at an early age which was cool.

63
00:03:37,375 --> 00:03:40,250
So I first started getting involved in kind

64
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:44,167
of nonmicrocontroller development.

65
00:03:44,167 --> 00:03:46,626
So making boards for red boxes and blue boxes and various phone

66
00:03:46,626 --> 00:03:48,417
phreaking stuff.

67
00:03:48,417 --> 00:03:50,709
The state of limitations is probably up.

68
00:03:50,709 --> 00:03:54,959
I got involved in embedded development

69
00:03:54,959 --> 00:04:00,209
in teenage years, I was Motorola HC05 guy

70
00:04:00,209 --> 00:04:05,083
and got involved with microchip picks

71
00:04:05,083 --> 00:04:08,999
and stayed with those.

72
00:04:08,999 --> 00:04:10,167
Motorola scaled off into free scale so I started

73
00:04:10,167 --> 00:04:11,792
using that.

74
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:15,999
But, if you notice for DEF CON 14 badge was

75
00:04:15,999 --> 00:04:21,459
a microchip pick and 15 18 was all free scale.

76
00:04:21,667 --> 00:04:25,334
That's because they would talk me out to dinner more than microchip did.

77
00:04:26,709 --> 00:04:27,876
So.

78
00:04:27,876 --> 00:04:30,876
Fastest way to Joe Grand's heart is through his stomach.

79
00:04:30,876 --> 00:04:31,999
JOE GRAND: Free food.

80
00:04:31,999 --> 00:04:33,501
So remember that.

81
00:04:33,876 --> 00:04:38,334
So yeah, I sort of specialized in embedded system development

82
00:04:38,334 --> 00:04:42,501
of low end consumer and household devices.

83
00:04:42,501 --> 00:04:44,167
And then of course I do hardware security break

84
00:04:44,167 --> 00:04:46,792
stuff once in a while, too.

85
00:04:46,999 --> 00:04:49,918
Interesting side note, Joe, did you notice that some

86
00:04:49,918 --> 00:04:53,542
of the stuff you submitted to parallax for sail I was looking

87
00:04:53,542 --> 00:04:56,083
at them with Joe bare man.

88
00:04:56,083 --> 00:04:57,083
I know.

89
00:04:57,083 --> 00:05:01,584
That's how Joe and I met so before we met through DEF CON,

90
00:05:01,584 --> 00:05:07,792
I was looking at his products and I think it was the GPS module.

91
00:05:07,999 --> 00:05:11,501
When we were having before GPS was easy to deal with.

92
00:05:11,501 --> 00:05:13,375
And we were standing outside and was it John Williams

93
00:05:13,375 --> 00:05:16,209
busting your balls about something?

94
00:05:16,209 --> 00:05:17,751
I just remember the interaction we had

95
00:05:17,751 --> 00:05:20,584
and you were going to    I think Ryan was at DEF CON

96
00:05:20,584 --> 00:05:23,999
and I was at DEF CON but I don't know if we knew each other,

97
00:05:23,999 --> 00:05:26,375
you work at Paralax, weird.

98
00:05:26,999 --> 00:05:29,876
Embedded world is a small community.

99
00:05:29,876 --> 00:05:30,918
And Ford for the record I do not work

100
00:05:30,918 --> 00:05:32,792
for them any more.

101
00:05:33,542 --> 00:05:40,667
The first question for everyone    The funny thing

102
00:05:40,667 --> 00:05:46,999
is Smitty put this whole thing together.

103
00:05:48,209 --> 00:05:51,501
MARK "SMITTY" SMITH: I'm not sure how I convinced these people to do

104
00:05:51,501 --> 00:05:53,292
the panel with me.

105
00:05:53,584 --> 00:05:56,834
I'm Mark Smith or Smitty, I'm the only one who does not use

106
00:05:56,834 --> 00:05:59,834
microcontrollers professionally.

107
00:06:01,125 --> 00:06:02,999
I'm a lobbyist.

108
00:06:02,999 --> 00:06:05,250
I spend most of my time at@mail and not.

109
00:06:05,999 --> 00:06:10,667
Thank you for saying that and not the other A word.

110
00:06:21,334 --> 00:06:24,751
Got a bad reception on that one.

111
00:06:24,751 --> 00:06:27,999
But I got a start at I very I don't think age.

112
00:06:27,999 --> 00:06:33,999
Older sister got a TS80, I think the 8800 beats that.

113
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:37,209
So I started on that doing basic.

114
00:06:37,209 --> 00:06:39,584
I didn't get into assembly until comment in the early 90s,

115
00:06:39,584 --> 00:06:43,125
my first micro controller work was on 801 but I didn't spend a lot

116
00:06:43,125 --> 00:06:46,792
of time on Intel because that assembly sticks.

117
00:06:49,751 --> 00:06:51,626
I'm a lobbyist.

118
00:06:51,626 --> 00:06:54,083
I'm network engineer and system administrator by trade

119
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:57,459
and I do this on weekend for fun and I like making stuff

120
00:06:57,459 --> 00:06:59,709
and thing that work.

121
00:06:59,918 --> 00:07:02,125
I've been into electronics for a long time and then once

122
00:07:02,125 --> 00:07:05,083
microcontrollers started getting really cheap in the 90s,

123
00:07:05,083 --> 00:07:09,375
that's when I started add being programmability to my projects.

124
00:07:11,999 --> 00:07:14,999
And thanks for putting this panel together

125
00:07:14,999 --> 00:07:17,292
by the way, Smitty.

126
00:07:17,542 --> 00:07:21,626
(Cheers and applause) You're welcome.

127
00:07:21,876 --> 00:07:27,292
So everyone who is not playing with microcontrollers or just starting

128
00:07:27,292 --> 00:07:33,417
like I am, initially it's the question of where do you start?

129
00:07:33,417 --> 00:07:36,792
Because it is such a huge field and so many platforms,

130
00:07:36,792 --> 00:07:40,375
so many development tools out there.

131
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:43,999
How the hell are you supposed to know where to begin.

132
00:07:44,584 --> 00:07:47,459
Some of you teach classes on this.

133
00:07:47,459 --> 00:07:51,459
What is a good place to start and learn this?

134
00:07:51,459 --> 00:07:53,083
Should we go down the line?

135
00:07:53,083 --> 00:07:54,501
Let's just talk.

136
00:07:54,667 --> 00:07:56,918
I think that's definitely like people come up to me and ask

137
00:07:56,918 --> 00:07:58,459
the same thing.

138
00:07:58,876 --> 00:08:00,626
There's so many different choices.

139
00:08:00,626 --> 00:08:03,999
And the good thing about nowadays is that there are so many choices.

140
00:08:03,999 --> 00:08:04,709
Back in the day if you wanted to get

141
00:08:04,709 --> 00:08:06,959
into the micro controller development, you had to get

142
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:09,876
the individual microcontroller, deal with the development environment,

143
00:08:09,876 --> 00:08:13,125
add a bunch of external stuff just to get the platform up.

144
00:08:13,999 --> 00:08:17,999
And then you were writing like assembly.

145
00:08:18,709 --> 00:08:20,584
So now it's like you have Arduino platforms,

146
00:08:20,584 --> 00:08:23,999
you have propeller processor, Raspberry Pi, beagle bone.

147
00:08:25,501 --> 00:08:28,792
And all these things it depends on what you want to do

148
00:08:28,792 --> 00:08:31,792
with that device, because there's so many different

149
00:08:31,792 --> 00:08:35,999
flavors and so many different levels, if you're doing something basic,

150
00:08:35,999 --> 00:08:39,501
maybe use a basic stamp or Arduino, maybe raspberry pie which

151
00:08:39,501 --> 00:08:43,083
is Linux based so you can write Linux stuff.

152
00:08:43,083 --> 00:08:44,959
You don't have to be a hardware guy.

153
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:47,501
You can just write code and have it work on the stuff.

154
00:08:51,959 --> 00:08:53,999
I agree it depends on what you're doing,

155
00:08:53,999 --> 00:08:57,999
but for somebody who's new, it depends on the tool chain for me.

156
00:08:58,167 --> 00:09:01,584
I can't take a n00b and drop them into certain tool chains that are

157
00:09:01,584 --> 00:09:04,542
like slamming your nuts in a door.

158
00:09:05,125 --> 00:09:10,751
Certain PGA development software packages, for lack of a better word,

159
00:09:10,751 --> 00:09:14,083
are not exactly user friendly.

160
00:09:14,083 --> 00:09:15,125
I think a lot of engineering tools suck anyway,

161
00:09:15,125 --> 00:09:18,125
so you have to find the one that sucks the least.

162
00:09:18,999 --> 00:09:21,542
Yeah, you mentioned the A word.

163
00:09:21,542 --> 00:09:25,125
But the one thing I think Arduino has above many of the other platforms it

164
00:09:25,125 --> 00:09:28,334
is meant for artists not engineers.

165
00:09:29,083 --> 00:09:33,918
So the thing that Arduino did that made it so popular is that

166
00:09:33,918 --> 00:09:39,501
they made everything so incredibly simple and trivial to use.

167
00:09:39,501 --> 00:09:41,209
You don't have to buy a programmer.

168
00:09:41,209 --> 00:09:43,083
The programmer is on the board itself.

169
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:44,542
The only problem I had with the Arduino and

170
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:46,751
the Arduino zealots.

171
00:09:46,999 --> 00:09:48,999
I don't have any problem with AVR.

172
00:09:48,999 --> 00:09:50,501
To be clear I'm not a zealot.

173
00:09:50,501 --> 00:09:51,501
I get that.

174
00:09:51,501 --> 00:09:52,999
The thing that frustrates me is they talk as though it's

175
00:09:52,999 --> 00:09:56,292
the first time it's been done because there was a lot of money,

176
00:09:56,292 --> 00:09:58,876
0'Reilly and the maker crowd started backing it

177
00:09:58,876 --> 00:10:01,417
and processing and environment.

178
00:10:02,584 --> 00:10:05,999
But they're not doing the basic stamp, yeah.

179
00:10:06,584 --> 00:10:09,792
So I mean I think really, as far as going that route,

180
00:10:09,792 --> 00:10:13,584
the stamp was really the first chip to do that.

181
00:10:13,584 --> 00:10:14,667
Yeah, that's true.

182
00:10:14,667 --> 00:10:18,209
The problem the stamp has had and I'm so are people out there,

183
00:10:18,209 --> 00:10:23,626
they haven't grown with the pay that user space has grown.

184
00:10:23,626 --> 00:10:26,542
And they're still charging 50 bucks for a basic stamp too.

185
00:10:26,542 --> 00:10:29,375
And you can't compete at that price point and actually have

186
00:10:29,375 --> 00:10:31,751
talked to Ken Gracie.

187
00:10:32,501 --> 00:10:34,125
I love the basic stamp.

188
00:10:34,125 --> 00:10:35,125
I do.

189
00:10:35,125 --> 00:10:37,083
On a number of occasions I've heard Joe say when

190
00:10:37,083 --> 00:10:42,167
I'm prototyping I grab basic things off the shelf but it's ridiculous

191
00:10:42,167 --> 00:10:46,417
to charge 50 bucks for that chip these days.

192
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:49,375
If you're going to stay competitive as far as the stamp is concerned,

193
00:10:49,375 --> 00:10:52,083
you're going to need to lower the price on that.

194
00:10:52,083 --> 00:10:54,292
I don't mean to be airing dirty laundry but that's

195
00:10:54,292 --> 00:10:57,584
the kind of stuff you want to hear.

196
00:10:59,999 --> 00:11:04,709
People bash on Arduino on hackabay, Arduino, lame.

197
00:11:08,083 --> 00:11:11,999
There's a religious war just like open source

198
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:15,209
and Linux versus whatever.

199
00:11:15,209 --> 00:11:18,792
But Arduino for what it is it's good.

200
00:11:18,792 --> 00:11:22,459
If you want to get something done, there's lots of example code out there.

201
00:11:22,459 --> 00:11:24,584
There's lots of support from the community versus something

202
00:11:24,584 --> 00:11:26,834
like the basic stamp.

203
00:11:26,834 --> 00:11:29,083
You have community support you about you have support directly

204
00:11:29,083 --> 00:11:31,459
from parallax but the community support tends

205
00:11:31,459 --> 00:11:32,999
to be okay.

206
00:11:32,999 --> 00:11:34,501
My only problem with Arduino is that a lot

207
00:11:34,501 --> 00:11:38,083
of the open source stuff that's out there, the modules people write,

208
00:11:38,083 --> 00:11:40,792
nobody's validating that stuff.

209
00:11:40,792 --> 00:11:42,083
You don't know if it's good.

210
00:11:42,083 --> 00:11:44,125
Paint by numbers, plug stuff together.

211
00:11:44,125 --> 00:11:46,083
Great for prototyping but once you're done if it's a one

212
00:11:46,083 --> 00:11:48,334
off project, that's fine.

213
00:11:48,334 --> 00:11:49,834
If you want to move it forward, that's when you have

214
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:51,501
to start going through and making sure it's

215
00:11:51,501 --> 00:11:52,999
actually good.

216
00:11:53,292 --> 00:11:55,083
But with the subject on the subject

217
00:11:55,083 --> 00:11:59,083
of how do you get started, though, I would rather have somebody who

218
00:11:59,083 --> 00:12:02,501
is new to the hobby get an Arduino for 30 bucks, plug it

219
00:12:02,501 --> 00:12:06,334
in with a USB cables, load up the blink code, get it functioning

220
00:12:06,334 --> 00:12:09,083
and go that's fucking awesome.

221
00:12:10,334 --> 00:12:13,167
Look at the blink code for Arduino and OS2.

222
00:12:13,167 --> 00:12:16,334
I can put my mom in front of a OS2 and she'll understand it.

223
00:12:16,334 --> 00:12:18,999
Am I mom did not do computers.

224
00:12:19,125 --> 00:12:21,918
Or the board of education stuff.

225
00:12:22,209 --> 00:12:25,125
So I'm not trying like I said, I'm not a zealot I'm not trying to put

226
00:12:25,125 --> 00:12:28,292
the Arduino in instead of basic stamp stuff.

227
00:12:28,292 --> 00:12:29,751
Definitely not doing that.

228
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:34,250
So I guess we need to make two categories

229
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:38,083
of the simpler consumer targeted microcontrollers versus

230
00:12:38,083 --> 00:12:42,999
the industrial I work on this shit all day, I have the programmers and

231
00:12:42,999 --> 00:12:46,417
the you know, I can write together.

232
00:12:46,999 --> 00:12:50,999
Smitty just as a matter of confession, I've sold Arduinos

233
00:12:50,999 --> 00:12:53,083
at DEF CON before.

234
00:12:53,626 --> 00:12:57,292
I'm not anti Arduino, what I'm anti is the attitude of this

235
00:12:57,292 --> 00:13:00,334
is the holy grail come down from high to save me

236
00:13:00,334 --> 00:13:03,501
from my microcontroller ignorance.

237
00:13:05,959 --> 00:13:09,999
Or the idea that anything else is way too difficult.

238
00:13:09,999 --> 00:13:11,209
You know, I don't know how many guys think

239
00:13:11,209 --> 00:13:13,250
Arduino is great because I don't need

240
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:16,709
an in circuit programmer until it blows up.

241
00:13:17,167 --> 00:13:19,959
What's an in circuit programmer, a piece of hardware you plug it

242
00:13:19,959 --> 00:13:21,667
in and say program.

243
00:13:21,667 --> 00:13:24,876
Not that hard for people who is used to pushing packets around a network

244
00:13:24,876 --> 00:13:26,375
to use that.

245
00:13:26,751 --> 00:13:29,542
TI's MS3 chain is getting perfect easy good in terms

246
00:13:29,542 --> 00:13:31,459
of being usable.

247
00:13:31,999 --> 00:13:35,459
But you can't have her load up MSP30.

248
00:13:36,459 --> 00:13:39,167
Arduino is good for that.

249
00:13:39,167 --> 00:13:42,167
One of these days we'll let Render ask another question.

250
00:13:42,751 --> 00:13:46,709
I don't want this to be me asking all questions.

251
00:13:46,709 --> 00:13:47,876
There's a microphone.

252
00:13:49,083 --> 00:13:55,751
Ask us questions or we'll just keep bitching all day RenderMan one.

253
00:14:00,501 --> 00:14:06,292
One of the biggest difficulty I've had getting meeker into it is you get

254
00:14:06,292 --> 00:14:09,999
the idea and you want to build it now I've got

255
00:14:09,999 --> 00:14:13,083
to do spark phone Ikea order and you have

256
00:14:13,083 --> 00:14:16,209
to wait weeks I'm in Canada.

257
00:14:16,375 --> 00:14:18,542
That's your problem.

258
00:14:18,751 --> 00:14:20,999
I'm cheap and don't want to pay FedEx.

259
00:14:21,167 --> 00:14:25,667
One of the things I used to tell students you can get engineering

260
00:14:25,667 --> 00:14:29,999
sample from microchip than just about anywhere.

261
00:14:30,083 --> 00:14:31,501
That's the question.

262
00:14:31,876 --> 00:14:34,667
Inevitably you end up with parts bins.

263
00:14:34,709 --> 00:14:38,667
But the problem is sinking a huge amount of money into that.

264
00:14:38,667 --> 00:14:41,459
Is there shortcuts or ways like engineering samples

265
00:14:41,459 --> 00:14:43,751
to get base stuff.

266
00:14:43,751 --> 00:14:44,999
Constantly harvest.

267
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:48,083
Pretend you're a squirrel and just start gathering stuff.

268
00:14:49,792 --> 00:14:51,959
If vendors think they're going to make money,

269
00:14:51,959 --> 00:14:54,125
they'll give you free stuff.

270
00:14:54,125 --> 00:14:55,417
But, if they think you're doing something

271
00:14:55,417 --> 00:14:58,626
cool they'll also give you free stuff because it gives them something

272
00:14:58,626 --> 00:15:02,083
they can promote and write about on Twitter or whatever.

273
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:03,999
To Geoff a few samples out to a lobbyist isn't going

274
00:15:03,999 --> 00:15:05,876
to kill them hearing.

275
00:15:08,542 --> 00:15:11,083
I live in San Francisco and there's a weird cycle

276
00:15:11,083 --> 00:15:14,999
of people put stuff on the street and you can take stuff and put other

277
00:15:14,999 --> 00:15:16,999
stuff on the street.

278
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:17,999
It's weird.

279
00:15:17,999 --> 00:15:20,918
Sometimes it makes neighborhoods look really shitty.

280
00:15:21,125 --> 00:15:22,584
Sometimes it's awesome if you get there

281
00:15:22,584 --> 00:15:24,999
before the city comes and picks stuff up.

282
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:26,999
Oh, a printer.

283
00:15:29,876 --> 00:15:32,459
Go into local surplus stores.

284
00:15:32,584 --> 00:15:35,918
You don't have to pay full price for things but even if you do,

285
00:15:35,918 --> 00:15:37,999
full price is like pennies or a few dollars

286
00:15:37,999 --> 00:15:40,999
for stuff unless you live in Canada.

287
00:15:40,999 --> 00:15:41,792
And make friends with engineers

288
00:15:41,792 --> 00:15:46,083
because all of my engineers had desks that were filled with sample.

289
00:15:46,167 --> 00:15:49,375
Oh, this part is so cool I can call up the distributor and get it.

290
00:15:49,375 --> 00:15:50,999
But scavenging parts.

291
00:15:50,999 --> 00:15:52,709
That's how I learned how to solder.

292
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:56,125
It's harder these days with the service mount stuff.

293
00:15:56,375 --> 00:15:58,542
Back in the day that's how I got parts.

294
00:15:58,542 --> 00:16:00,999
Worst case Radio Shack.

295
00:16:00,999 --> 00:16:03,751
I know they've had I'm dead serious, they've got a really bad reputation

296
00:16:03,751 --> 00:16:06,334
over the last 5 or 10 years when they got rid of a lot

297
00:16:06,334 --> 00:16:09,584
of their electronics stuff but they kept that one little section

298
00:16:09,584 --> 00:16:13,250
where you could get resistors and capacitors and stuff.

299
00:16:13,501 --> 00:16:16,083
Now it's like 9/10ths of the store is selling cell phones

300
00:16:16,083 --> 00:16:18,792
but there's that one drawer.

301
00:16:18,999 --> 00:16:20,751
Last resort.

302
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:23,417
So 8:30 at night my DSL modem just died

303
00:16:23,417 --> 00:16:26,626
and I have an exploded capacitor.

304
00:16:27,876 --> 00:16:31,751
I could still go down to Radio Shack and buy that 660

305
00:16:31,751 --> 00:16:35,542
micro capacitor to get my Internet back online so my

306
00:16:35,542 --> 00:16:38,918
wife can watch game of thrones.

307
00:16:40,459 --> 00:16:42,417
So Radio Shack.

308
00:16:42,417 --> 00:16:46,542
They're also getting into sell things I got a fan out here.

309
00:16:46,542 --> 00:16:48,999
They're also getting into selling microcontrollers

310
00:16:48,999 --> 00:16:53,417
like the A word and basic stamp and a lot of modules.

311
00:16:53,417 --> 00:16:58,751
I totally didn't mean for you to start saying the A word.

312
00:16:58,751 --> 00:16:59,876
(Laughter) But they're not the cheapest around,

313
00:16:59,876 --> 00:17:02,999
but when you need it right bloody now, they're there.

314
00:17:03,792 --> 00:17:06,918
The fact they have modules.

315
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:09,167
That's recent and I love it.

316
00:17:09,167 --> 00:17:11,876
Hardware has come full circle.

317
00:17:12,751 --> 00:17:19,459
We built heathkit and it died out when computers got big.

318
00:17:19,459 --> 00:17:22,125
Computers nearly went away as a hobby.

319
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:25,292
Why do I want to do this hard stuff and get chloride

320
00:17:25,292 --> 00:17:29,918
on my hands when I can write code and compile and compile.

321
00:17:29,918 --> 00:17:30,918
It fucked up.

322
00:17:30,999 --> 00:17:34,459
It didn't cost you anything it's moving more with the advent

323
00:17:34,459 --> 00:17:37,125
of FPGAs coming down in price.

324
00:17:37,375 --> 00:17:40,209
Just recompile the hardware.

325
00:17:40,876 --> 00:17:44,209
Electronics as a hobby, more of a system level hobby where some

326
00:17:44,209 --> 00:17:47,083
of us still build our own boards.

327
00:17:47,083 --> 00:17:50,876
There's so many modules you don't have to do that.

328
00:17:50,876 --> 00:17:52,083
It's true, like LEGOs.

329
00:17:52,167 --> 00:17:54,999
AUDIENCE: What do you do whenever you're

330
00:17:54,999 --> 00:17:59,083
up against a particularly crappy tool chain?

331
00:17:59,083 --> 00:18:01,542
What's your method of attack to get past that?

332
00:18:01,542 --> 00:18:02,626
Cry.

333
00:18:02,626 --> 00:18:04,125
A lot of mountain dew.

334
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:10,667
I think it depends, I've had crappy tool chains.

335
00:18:11,083 --> 00:18:12,999
Sometimes you're stuck.

336
00:18:12,999 --> 00:18:17,417
If that's all vendor offers you, mile have contact and say you're tool

337
00:18:17,417 --> 00:18:20,834
chain sucks but most of the time I'm dealing

338
00:18:20,834 --> 00:18:23,999
with the crappy tool chain and when I talk

339
00:18:23,999 --> 00:18:29,083
about crappy tool chain what I've encountered is the tool crash or it

340
00:18:29,083 --> 00:18:34,334
will disconnect from the debugger or something annoying that you have

341
00:18:34,334 --> 00:18:36,125
to restart.

342
00:18:36,501 --> 00:18:38,292
And that's I think the nature of engineering tools

343
00:18:38,292 --> 00:18:41,250
because they're designed for engineers and they're not designed

344
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:43,999
for the mass public so they don't go through the testing

345
00:18:43,999 --> 00:18:46,918
as like a normal piece of software would.

346
00:18:47,083 --> 00:18:49,626
And yeah, I mean, they're just annoying and sometimes

347
00:18:49,626 --> 00:18:51,999
crappy, but as long as they end up compiling properly

348
00:18:51,999 --> 00:18:54,501
and working properly, sometimes.

349
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:57,918
On the hardware sigh I don't use Kai cat any more,

350
00:18:57,918 --> 00:19:00,083
they crashed too many times.

351
00:19:01,209 --> 00:19:02,792
Same guy.

352
00:19:03,167 --> 00:19:09,083
I'll buy you a beer afterwards.

353
00:19:09,083 --> 00:19:10,375
Same guy.

354
00:19:14,709 --> 00:19:19,083
Did you hear when I was doing stuff for this year I used the free version

355
00:19:19,083 --> 00:19:21,375
of eagle because I wanted everyone here

356
00:19:21,375 --> 00:19:25,083
to be able to recreate the badges with free software and I found

357
00:19:25,083 --> 00:19:27,709
an error in eagle that says too many pixels

358
00:19:27,709 --> 00:19:31,999
in the Y direction and it says it in German on the bottom.

359
00:19:32,334 --> 00:19:36,918
So I took the work and rotated it in the other direction and it doesn't

360
00:19:36,918 --> 00:19:39,999
exist in the other directions.

361
00:19:39,999 --> 00:19:42,334
Now everyone can make their own black badges.

362
00:19:43,542 --> 00:19:48,209
If they can do that, they deserve a black badge.

363
00:19:49,999 --> 00:19:51,792
Next question?

364
00:19:51,999 --> 00:19:56,250
Yeah, so I wanted to ask you guys what do you think

365
00:19:56,250 --> 00:20:00,417
the best chip is for, like, DSP, like, audio D.

366
00:20:00,417 --> 00:20:02,999
Religious war.

367
00:20:03,999 --> 00:20:05,042
Start.

368
00:20:05,042 --> 00:20:06,042
DSP audio.

369
00:20:06,042 --> 00:20:10,209
Not the best but the best to start with for DSP and audio stuff.

370
00:20:12,751 --> 00:20:14,459
I got nothing.

371
00:20:14,459 --> 00:20:16,209
The one you already have code for.

372
00:20:16,209 --> 00:20:18,999
I mean, you know, from a professional's viewpoint.

373
00:20:18,999 --> 00:20:20,000
Oh, this one is cheaper.

374
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
This is faster.

375
00:20:21,584 --> 00:20:24,125
But how does that equate to a few hundred hours

376
00:20:24,125 --> 00:20:26,542
of engineering time.

377
00:20:26,542 --> 00:20:27,999
If you've got code, if you can code what you want to do,

378
00:20:27,999 --> 00:20:30,834
that whole project, where do I start?

379
00:20:30,834 --> 00:20:33,542
Find a project that's similar to where you want to go.

380
00:20:33,542 --> 00:20:34,999
Or find a vendor that has reference code

381
00:20:34,999 --> 00:20:38,334
or application note for where you want to go.

382
00:20:38,334 --> 00:20:40,542
Make really good friends with the FAEs.

383
00:20:40,542 --> 00:20:42,999
The only experience I have with DSP stuff

384
00:20:42,999 --> 00:20:46,501
is the DEF CON 17 damage had a controller so it was

385
00:20:46,501 --> 00:20:52,542
a microcontrollers that had DSP functionality and that's all I know of.

386
00:20:54,375 --> 00:20:57,959
The tool said it's not open source but it's free.

387
00:20:58,626 --> 00:21:01,417
And which is to me, fine, good enough.

388
00:21:01,417 --> 00:21:03,918
It's even better than open source if it's free.

389
00:21:04,999 --> 00:21:08,250
There was one thing called the processor expert and you could

390
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:10,709
select modules and say I want to implement

391
00:21:10,709 --> 00:21:13,834
an FFT and you double click and there's a GUI and set it

392
00:21:13,834 --> 00:21:15,999
up and that will configure the DSP side

393
00:21:15,999 --> 00:21:19,417
of things and you can do mode um old school 1200 baud so that's

394
00:21:19,417 --> 00:21:21,834
a good place to start but I'm sure there's

395
00:21:21,834 --> 00:21:25,501
a reference design somewhere or project that does something similar

396
00:21:25,501 --> 00:21:27,876
to what you want to do.

397
00:21:27,999 --> 00:21:30,959
I do a lot of audio work, audio electronics stuff as well

398
00:21:30,959 --> 00:21:34,501
as digital and that's generally where I'll start out.

399
00:21:34,501 --> 00:21:37,125
I look for different chips and look for they'll have the application note

400
00:21:37,125 --> 00:21:39,999
in there of this is a typical application for this chip

401
00:21:39,999 --> 00:21:42,334
and I'll try to find one that matches closely what

402
00:21:42,334 --> 00:21:43,999
I try to do.

403
00:21:44,209 --> 00:21:46,999
Do you have to do that standing behind me?

404
00:21:46,999 --> 00:21:48,083
That looks awful.

405
00:21:50,584 --> 00:21:52,999
It sounds like render is peeing.

406
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:57,167
AUDIENCE: Is there like a resource that I can go

407
00:21:57,167 --> 00:22:01,959
to to kind of, like, browse through all these different chip

408
00:22:01,959 --> 00:22:04,959
examples and --    Google.

409
00:22:04,959 --> 00:22:06,999
There's this thing called the Internet.

410
00:22:06,999 --> 00:22:09,459
Each of the different vendors have going to have their own site and list

411
00:22:09,459 --> 00:22:14,083
of things and they're going to talk about why they're chip is awesome.

412
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:14,999
They don't necessarily say better than the competitor

413
00:22:14,999 --> 00:22:16,626
because they don't want to acknowledge that

414
00:22:16,626 --> 00:22:18,459
the competitor exists but they'll say we're awesome

415
00:22:18,459 --> 00:22:20,709
because we have all these things.

416
00:22:20,709 --> 00:22:21,999
And the competitor will say we're awesome

417
00:22:21,999 --> 00:22:24,209
because we have the same things, you look

418
00:22:24,209 --> 00:22:27,125
at the list and they're 90% overlap.

419
00:22:27,375 --> 00:22:30,334
See which one takes you out to dinner more.

420
00:22:34,334 --> 00:22:36,999
Have you used octo part?

421
00:22:38,417 --> 00:22:41,459
Yeah, it gives you data sheets but it's not as easy

422
00:22:41,459 --> 00:22:44,999
as like a parametric search on a vendor site.

423
00:22:45,334 --> 00:22:47,751
Octo part will tell you which distributors have stock

424
00:22:47,751 --> 00:22:52,334
of the current part you're I searching for and give you data sheets.

425
00:22:52,334 --> 00:22:55,959
But, if you search for DSP, you might see stuff, but go

426
00:22:55,959 --> 00:22:59,501
to digikey and do a search and organize by price

427
00:22:59,501 --> 00:23:02,709
or    Mousers is much better.

428
00:23:06,334 --> 00:23:11,083
So other than the big dogs,Ikey, mouser, Janeco and places

429
00:23:11,083 --> 00:23:17,125
like electronics are there any other major houses you order from?

430
00:23:17,999 --> 00:23:22,334
I use Ikey primarily.

431
00:23:22,459 --> 00:23:26,250
They just started doing first class mail shipping so you can pay 2 bucks

432
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:30,083
and depending where you live get it within a day or two.

433
00:23:30,667 --> 00:23:31,999
Doesn't work for me.

434
00:23:31,999 --> 00:23:33,751
You guys don't count.

435
00:23:33,751 --> 00:23:36,334
The fun thing about digikey for the longest time.

436
00:23:37,417 --> 00:23:39,250
I key, right?

437
00:23:39,292 --> 00:23:43,999
I complained and it got bigger and bigger and it used to come

438
00:23:43,999 --> 00:23:46,999
with stickers so you could tag the pages

439
00:23:46,999 --> 00:23:51,083
because there was so much shit in there.

440
00:23:51,083 --> 00:23:53,999
When they stopped making the catalogs I complained

441
00:23:53,999 --> 00:23:58,334
because I'm against the trees I like something I can flip

442
00:23:58,334 --> 00:24:00,667
through and look.

443
00:24:00,667 --> 00:24:01,999
I used that catalog.

444
00:24:01,999 --> 00:24:04,375
That's the only way to find a connector.

445
00:24:04,751 --> 00:24:08,834
Try to find a connector on a damn parametric search.

446
00:24:12,709 --> 00:24:14,501
Next question?

447
00:24:14,501 --> 00:24:15,501
I'll out myself.

448
00:24:15,501 --> 00:24:16,501
I love my Arduino.

449
00:24:16,959 --> 00:24:18,501
I'm sure most of the people here are here

450
00:24:18,501 --> 00:24:21,375
because they got started on Arduino.

451
00:24:21,375 --> 00:24:22,792
Show of hands.

452
00:24:22,792 --> 00:24:23,792
Yeah.

453
00:24:23,792 --> 00:24:24,792
Who used Arduino.

454
00:24:24,792 --> 00:24:27,999
Who's going to admit to using the A word?

455
00:24:28,999 --> 00:24:33,250
I will.

456
00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:36,334
How many people their first experience was a basic stamp?

457
00:24:36,334 --> 00:24:37,501
How many was like pick?

458
00:24:37,959 --> 00:24:40,083
Really quickly, I want to interject this

459
00:24:40,083 --> 00:24:43,083
before you ask your question.

460
00:24:43,083 --> 00:24:46,709
My first experience with a pick was hacking your hex code

461
00:24:46,709 --> 00:24:49,709
from the DEF CON 14 badge.

462
00:24:49,709 --> 00:24:52,375
I was the only one who successfully reprogrammed that badge and I did not

463
00:24:52,375 --> 00:24:53,999
get picked.

464
00:24:54,918 --> 00:24:59,999
I'll have to review the contest entries.

465
00:24:59,999 --> 00:25:02,167
The guy with audio, this was cool.

466
00:25:03,375 --> 00:25:05,083
I'll admit.

467
00:25:08,999 --> 00:25:11,209
I'll review the notes.

468
00:25:12,626 --> 00:25:16,501
No, I've got MSP launch pad on tomorrow.

469
00:25:16,501 --> 00:25:18,459
I started on M bed 32 bit.

470
00:25:18,959 --> 00:25:20,083
That thing is awesome.

471
00:25:20,999 --> 00:25:25,250
Going back to the Arduino and lobbyist artist thing.

472
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:27,626
Spark fun, ate A fruit.

473
00:25:28,999 --> 00:25:31,417
Love spark fun.

474
00:25:31,417 --> 00:25:32,417
Good stuff.

475
00:25:32,417 --> 00:25:33,834
The drop in hardware.

476
00:25:33,834 --> 00:25:37,792
The LEGO I can drop the code in and compile it, run it there,

477
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:42,834
do you think that's devaluing the industry at all.

478
00:25:42,834 --> 00:25:43,834
Not at all.

479
00:25:44,083 --> 00:25:46,167
I love the I'm sorry.

480
00:25:46,542 --> 00:25:50,083
I know the guys at spark fun and they love their stuff.

481
00:25:50,167 --> 00:25:52,125
It shows up all the time.

482
00:25:52,125 --> 00:25:53,125
I think it's great.

483
00:25:53,125 --> 00:25:54,959
I think it's happening.

484
00:25:54,959 --> 00:25:57,751
People who wouldn't be able to accomplish certain projects

485
00:25:57,751 --> 00:26:02,083
because it's making it LEGO slap the pieces together.

486
00:26:02,083 --> 00:26:03,999
Especially thinking the lilypad with the folks doing

487
00:26:03,999 --> 00:26:06,999
the clothing hacks and stuff like that.

488
00:26:06,999 --> 00:26:09,999
I think it's opened that world to people who otherwise couldn't get

489
00:26:09,999 --> 00:26:13,667
throughout barrier in the same we the Arduino and stamp both made

490
00:26:13,667 --> 00:26:17,999
the pick and ABRs accessible to people who weren't otherwise.

491
00:26:17,999 --> 00:26:22,999
If I can interject a question on that, one of the big things I've always found

492
00:26:22,999 --> 00:26:26,792
is tinkering with stuff with the goggles you've built it

493
00:26:26,792 --> 00:26:30,459
with basic stamp or Arduino or whatever.

494
00:26:30,584 --> 00:26:34,876
Taking it to that next step, I no longer need all the accessories,

495
00:26:34,876 --> 00:26:37,250
I just need the chip.

496
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:41,584
My problem has always been where the hell do I figure out how to do that?

497
00:26:42,125 --> 00:26:46,250
Are you trying to make a product or stuff.

498
00:26:46,584 --> 00:26:47,959
Just one off stuff.

499
00:26:48,083 --> 00:26:50,751
Like a more refined things.

500
00:26:50,999 --> 00:26:52,999
Not a stack of shields.

501
00:26:53,542 --> 00:26:57,626
(Talking simultaneously.) I want to answer that but I want to say

502
00:26:57,626 --> 00:27:00,292
with with respect to fruit and spark fun and

503
00:27:00,292 --> 00:27:04,375
all these places, it doesn't only help the people getting into it

504
00:27:04,375 --> 00:27:06,501
and the hobbyists.

505
00:27:13,501 --> 00:27:16,167
It make break outboards and saves a ton of time.

506
00:27:17,334 --> 00:27:19,083
It definitely doesn't hurt.

507
00:27:19,083 --> 00:27:21,709
It's great for prototyping as well.

508
00:27:22,083 --> 00:27:25,375
I want this particular chip with this troller and see

509
00:27:25,375 --> 00:27:28,334
if I can make this product work.

510
00:27:28,334 --> 00:27:30,626
I'm going to do it first with these shields.

511
00:27:30,626 --> 00:27:34,459
Slap it together and say now I'm going to proof the concept.

512
00:27:34,459 --> 00:27:36,876
I'm going to design and fab a board that has just

513
00:27:36,876 --> 00:27:41,876
the components I need instead of a stack of shields this tall.

514
00:27:42,167 --> 00:27:44,751
That's what Render, you're asking.

515
00:27:44,751 --> 00:27:48,626
How do you distill it from all the crap.

516
00:27:48,999 --> 00:27:51,250
Render, you hire me.

517
00:27:51,667 --> 00:27:53,959
But, if you don't want to pay money

518
00:27:53,959 --> 00:27:56,918
at that point you need to look at schematics

519
00:27:56,918 --> 00:28:00,584
of every individual model, see which pieces you're using

520
00:28:00,584 --> 00:28:05,083
and I have a big prototype of all the crap and I identify which parts

521
00:28:05,083 --> 00:28:06,999
are useful.

522
00:28:06,999 --> 00:28:08,709
Create a smaller schematic and just get

523
00:28:08,709 --> 00:28:13,083
a board layout package that whatever you're familiar with.

524
00:28:13,083 --> 00:28:17,083
If you're not, use Kai cat or dip trace or whatever.

525
00:28:17,083 --> 00:28:18,083
Eagle.

526
00:28:18,083 --> 00:28:19,083
I use Altea.

527
00:28:19,792 --> 00:28:21,792
There's a trial version.

528
00:28:24,083 --> 00:28:27,125
Use OS8 park.com to get your boards fab'd, it's

529
00:28:27,125 --> 00:28:30,417
a dollar a square inch or something.

530
00:28:35,999 --> 00:28:37,834
FM I going to get kicked off the panel

531
00:28:37,834 --> 00:28:40,083
if I admit I use express PCB.

532
00:28:40,792 --> 00:28:44,667
No, for a lot of people for prototyping purposes there are

533
00:28:44,667 --> 00:28:48,459
some not so the way PCB express and a lot of those guys work

534
00:28:48,459 --> 00:28:51,999
is they'll release their own proprietary server with you

535
00:28:51,999 --> 00:28:54,959
they don't give the Gerbers.

536
00:28:57,999 --> 00:29:03,501
I know two different groups writing stuff to take the stuff that their software

537
00:29:03,501 --> 00:29:07,334
produced and give you your real Gerber's.

538
00:29:07,834 --> 00:29:11,751
Yeah, it's like jail break in the design process.

539
00:29:11,751 --> 00:29:12,876
But express PCB is a great service

540
00:29:12,876 --> 00:29:16,375
because they have their own software that is not nearly as complex

541
00:29:16,375 --> 00:29:19,417
as eagle or Kai cat or anything else.

542
00:29:19,417 --> 00:29:23,999
It is so incredibly dead simple to use to do circuit board layouts.

543
00:29:25,250 --> 00:29:28,876
They can do silk screen on the top, not on the bottom unfortunately.

544
00:29:28,999 --> 00:29:32,626
But once you have the design, if you can keep your board

545
00:29:32,626 --> 00:29:37,083
to 2.5 inches to 3.8 inches, you click a button and give them I think

546
00:29:37,083 --> 00:29:41,667
it's up to about 60 bucks right now if you don't need a soldier mask

547
00:29:41,667 --> 00:29:45,667
or 60 or 80 bucks if you weren't a solder mask or silk screen

548
00:29:45,667 --> 00:29:47,792
for three boards.

549
00:29:47,918 --> 00:29:50,709
And they'll get them to you in a week.

550
00:29:50,709 --> 00:29:53,584
It's incredibly cheap way of prototyping.

551
00:29:54,375 --> 00:29:58,167
That's not a tiny board, not huge but you can fit a lot

552
00:29:58,167 --> 00:30:00,999
on that amount of space.

553
00:30:00,999 --> 00:30:03,999
It's a great way of getting in.

554
00:30:03,999 --> 00:30:07,250
And I'm going to draw traces from here and inspect the pins.

555
00:30:07,250 --> 00:30:08,999
You don't have to worry about making it nice and clean,

556
00:30:08,999 --> 00:30:10,999
you're not making a product.

557
00:30:10,999 --> 00:30:12,042
It's just a prototype.

558
00:30:12,042 --> 00:30:13,334
Service is great.

559
00:30:14,709 --> 00:30:17,042
Orb park is a great way of doing it expensive,

560
00:30:17,042 --> 00:30:19,999
but they have a lot of lead time.

561
00:30:20,209 --> 00:30:22,584
He runs boards every other day.

562
00:30:23,667 --> 00:30:27,000
Laying outboards is a completely different discussion.

563
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:27,667
But for the most part if you're doing

564
00:30:27,667 --> 00:30:31,501
a prototype and it's not something that as a specific board layouts.

565
00:30:31,999 --> 00:30:33,999
It's an example tool.

566
00:30:33,999 --> 00:30:38,125
I want to mention for Canadians there's AP circuits.

567
00:30:38,167 --> 00:30:40,334
Someone is like A.

568
00:30:40,334 --> 00:30:43,042
You can use it.

569
00:30:43,918 --> 00:30:45,334
Alberta circuits.

570
00:30:45,334 --> 00:30:48,584
There's similar type of prototype quantity simple board type

571
00:30:48,584 --> 00:30:50,042
of house.

572
00:30:50,042 --> 00:30:53,834
They're expensive but they're fast.

573
00:30:53,834 --> 00:30:54,999
They're Canadian.

574
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:01,876
They ship to the U.S.

575
00:31:01,876 --> 00:31:05,501
AUDIENCE: I'm not afraid to ask dumb questions.

576
00:31:05,501 --> 00:31:07,167
We're not afraid to answer this.

577
00:31:07,167 --> 00:31:08,501
AUDIENCE: Excellent.

578
00:31:08,501 --> 00:31:11,083
I bought two boards a week ago, one was the beagle bone and

579
00:31:11,083 --> 00:31:14,999
the other was I think I just went to YouTube and searched

580
00:31:14,999 --> 00:31:18,709
on embedded program and found guystatemachine.com who

581
00:31:18,709 --> 00:31:23,292
did a 9 series lecture on use, the TI Solisis launch pad walking you

582
00:31:23,292 --> 00:31:25,334
through a CIDs.

583
00:31:27,999 --> 00:31:31,876
I guess the first question is are those microcontrollers

584
00:31:31,876 --> 00:31:35,999
or bigger    The beagle board is a great board.

585
00:31:36,375 --> 00:31:38,542
I like the beagle board stuff.

586
00:31:38,959 --> 00:31:40,167
I don't know if you guys have any thoughts

587
00:31:40,167 --> 00:31:41,709
on those.

588
00:31:41,709 --> 00:31:45,501
I would consider those modules, there's microcontrollers on them.

589
00:31:45,667 --> 00:31:49,125
But the distinction I think he's trying to make is they're not microcontrollers,

590
00:31:49,125 --> 00:31:50,792
they're CPUs.

591
00:31:51,209 --> 00:31:53,542
There's a very subtle distinction

592
00:31:53,542 --> 00:31:59,918
between where you're writing assembly or a C that's running on a chip timer.

593
00:32:00,501 --> 00:32:06,125
Intel considered there was an 8186.

594
00:32:06,125 --> 00:32:07,459
They interested it a microcontroller because it had

595
00:32:07,459 --> 00:32:09,083
a timer on board.

596
00:32:10,709 --> 00:32:15,584
I thought a microcontrollers had on board peripherals.

597
00:32:15,584 --> 00:32:18,751
So memory and stuff on board you don't have exposed

598
00:32:18,751 --> 00:32:22,999
busses going to outside stuff but a microprocessor was

599
00:32:22,999 --> 00:32:27,876
a CPU you needed to have mapping and data bus.

600
00:32:27,999 --> 00:32:31,626
But when you're talking about things like the beagle bone

601
00:32:31,626 --> 00:32:34,209
and the raspberry pie, the main difference

602
00:32:34,209 --> 00:32:39,999
is you're not necessarily writing code that has 100% control over the CPU.

603
00:32:39,999 --> 00:32:41,083
You're writing an application that runs

604
00:32:41,083 --> 00:32:43,542
inside an operating system.

605
00:32:43,542 --> 00:32:45,959
So it's a different in development environment

606
00:32:45,959 --> 00:32:49,751
and I'm not trying to make a religious distinction here.

607
00:32:49,751 --> 00:32:51,167
If they both have their place.

608
00:32:51,167 --> 00:32:54,125
You know, if you're a software guy and you don't need to worry

609
00:32:54,125 --> 00:32:57,501
about you don't want to have to worry about how to write

610
00:32:57,501 --> 00:33:01,999
a boot loader and you want something that does stuff and you're comfortable

611
00:33:01,999 --> 00:33:05,999
with GCC and you write applications in Linux all day, then put Linux

612
00:33:05,999 --> 00:33:10,083
on your chip or put Linux on your embedded environment.

613
00:33:10,083 --> 00:33:11,083
That's fine.

614
00:33:11,083 --> 00:33:14,999
It's gotten cheap enough that you know, Dr. Moore solved that problem for us.

615
00:33:14,999 --> 00:33:17,626
The reason we had microcontrollers is because they were smaller

616
00:33:17,626 --> 00:33:20,417
and simpler and cheaper when a full CPU was so much

617
00:33:20,417 --> 00:33:22,209
more expensive.

618
00:33:22,209 --> 00:33:23,876
That is no longer the case.

619
00:33:23,876 --> 00:33:26,999
We can now throw transistors at these things and it is the cost

620
00:33:26,999 --> 00:33:29,584
is no longer the problem.

621
00:33:29,584 --> 00:33:31,999
So we can put an entire Linux operating system

622
00:33:31,999 --> 00:33:35,292
on the thing and it's still 35 bucks.

623
00:33:35,501 --> 00:33:39,334
Costs about 30 35 bucks about depending where you buy it.

624
00:33:39,626 --> 00:33:42,709
Raspberry Pi is 35 bucks?

625
00:33:42,709 --> 00:33:43,999
What's the difference?

626
00:33:43,999 --> 00:33:45,209
The Raspberry Pi has a shit ton more resources

627
00:33:45,209 --> 00:33:48,999
but it needs it because it's running a full operating system.

628
00:33:49,417 --> 00:33:52,876
It's no longer a matter of which is better.

629
00:33:53,083 --> 00:33:54,709
They both have their place.

630
00:33:54,709 --> 00:33:57,417
It's a matter of which suits your application better.

631
00:33:57,417 --> 00:34:00,999
So the answer comes down to what you're trying to do.

632
00:34:00,999 --> 00:34:03,999
A lot of is that comes down to high performance timing.

633
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:05,999
If I need to get down to the hardware level

634
00:34:05,999 --> 00:34:08,083
on something like that's when it becomes more

635
00:34:08,083 --> 00:34:12,292
important to be able to get down to that level and have control.

636
00:34:12,292 --> 00:34:16,999
Most of you guys don't say interrupt latency as much as we do.

637
00:34:17,667 --> 00:34:20,959
Would you rather write a custom application that runs natively

638
00:34:20,959 --> 00:34:24,083
on the hardware as opposed to a device driver.

639
00:34:25,083 --> 00:34:28,792
Depends on the application, what you're trying to do with it.

640
00:34:28,792 --> 00:34:29,999
Think about robot.

641
00:34:29,999 --> 00:34:32,792
Do you really want an OS to control your motors on a robot,

642
00:34:32,792 --> 00:34:37,292
or do you want something that's very simple and predictable where you know

643
00:34:37,292 --> 00:34:40,876
exactly what you can do to take control.

644
00:34:40,876 --> 00:34:42,209
I'm not waiting on this to message that and for the OS

645
00:34:42,209 --> 00:34:44,083
to decide to come around and then turn the robot

646
00:34:44,083 --> 00:34:46,501
off before it drives off the cliff.

647
00:34:47,542 --> 00:34:50,959
But, if you have a good deterministic Artos,

648
00:34:50,959 --> 00:34:53,667
that's fine for embedded.

649
00:34:53,999 --> 00:34:55,999
You could run Windows you.

650
00:34:55,999 --> 00:34:58,417
I wouldn't but    I've got friends at willow garage who would shoot you

651
00:34:58,417 --> 00:34:59,876
for that.

652
00:35:03,751 --> 00:35:05,209
Depending on product.

653
00:35:05,584 --> 00:35:07,792
Surprised nobody brought him before now.

654
00:35:09,876 --> 00:35:13,417
Like in the robot example, I would put con tolls

655
00:35:13,417 --> 00:35:17,959
on mike low controller but I would use a Raspberry Pi to do

656
00:35:17,959 --> 00:35:21,999
the route processing and high level process and taking

657
00:35:21,999 --> 00:35:27,083
in video stream data and doing analysis of what's going on around me

658
00:35:27,083 --> 00:35:30,792
but have it send a signal to the microcontroller

659
00:35:30,792 --> 00:35:34,584
and say turn wheels around going my speed this long

660
00:35:34,584 --> 00:35:37,999
and have the control the motors.

661
00:35:37,999 --> 00:35:39,999
So that's the kind of decision making process you have

662
00:35:39,999 --> 00:35:42,125
to make at design time of what is it I'm trying

663
00:35:42,125 --> 00:35:46,083
to do and which platform is better for that particular task.

664
00:35:46,292 --> 00:35:49,334
If was just briefly mentioned here.

665
00:35:49,417 --> 00:35:52,667
The dreaded word that nobody likes to deal with is dealing

666
00:35:52,667 --> 00:35:56,417
with interrupts and interrupt timing and I think that's why we're now

667
00:35:56,417 --> 00:35:59,999
breaking into this point where we've got even, what I would call

668
00:35:59,999 --> 00:36:04,083
a microcontroller with multiple cores and stuff like that.

669
00:36:04,083 --> 00:36:06,751
Like the propeller is because you don't have to deal

670
00:36:06,751 --> 00:36:11,292
with time slicing and interrupt problems and loop timing and I think we're

671
00:36:11,292 --> 00:36:16,125
starting even further than that I think the real future for all of us is going

672
00:36:16,125 --> 00:36:19,999
to be what we see coming from the FPGA world.

673
00:36:21,542 --> 00:36:22,792
Thank you?

674
00:36:22,792 --> 00:36:27,167
AUDIENCE: Hi, oh, I'm happy to see the embedded stuff

675
00:36:27,167 --> 00:36:33,125
and I think Smitty for putting up this panel, really.

676
00:36:33,626 --> 00:36:38,083
My question to you is I'm a systems student and being I want

677
00:36:38,083 --> 00:36:42,083
to be in the field professionally like you know,

678
00:36:42,083 --> 00:36:45,876
not hobbyist but professionally.

679
00:36:46,792 --> 00:36:51,667
But earlier it was like if you're in microcontrollers you should know

680
00:36:51,667 --> 00:36:56,751
interface and you should know basic control logic design.

681
00:36:56,751 --> 00:37:00,083
That was the basic thing, stereotype in my mind.

682
00:37:00,083 --> 00:37:03,083
But now the time has changed a lot that the programming part,

683
00:37:03,083 --> 00:37:06,792
the controlled logic part has evolved and it's reached such

684
00:37:06,792 --> 00:37:10,292
a high level you can do software system, database systems,

685
00:37:10,292 --> 00:37:13,876
you can do control like all the systems.

686
00:37:13,876 --> 00:37:19,999
So designing and schematics and you know, sensor is still there.

687
00:37:20,167 --> 00:37:24,584
My question to you all is as a base as systems engineer, what are

688
00:37:24,584 --> 00:37:28,999
the basic things that at least I should know firmly?

689
00:37:29,334 --> 00:37:30,999
I hope I'm clear.

690
00:37:30,999 --> 00:37:33,375
I guess you're just asking what is a basic skill set to enter

691
00:37:33,375 --> 00:37:35,999
into that world as a professional?

692
00:37:35,999 --> 00:37:36,999
Is that correct?

693
00:37:36,999 --> 00:37:38,667
Yeah, the basic skills, yeah.

694
00:37:38,667 --> 00:37:42,667
And what later on I can decide on my own where I'm interested

695
00:37:42,667 --> 00:37:46,125
Well, I'm not the professional.

696
00:37:46,125 --> 00:37:47,125
You guys are.

697
00:37:47,626 --> 00:37:49,334
I'm never professional.

698
00:37:49,584 --> 00:37:54,999
Go ahead    Well, I almost feel like that's asking how do you become

699
00:37:54,999 --> 00:37:56,709
a hacker.

700
00:37:57,501 --> 00:38:01,792
To me it's a natural progression of hobbyists building stuff and then oh,

701
00:38:01,792 --> 00:38:05,375
wait, helping out at the a company and now they want to hire me

702
00:38:05,375 --> 00:38:08,999
and they're paying me to just do this stuff?

703
00:38:08,999 --> 00:38:12,501
So a lot of it is once you get this foot in the door, you already named

704
00:38:12,501 --> 00:38:15,999
off a lot of the things that are important.

705
00:38:15,999 --> 00:38:18,999
Once you find a company or a project that you're in love with,

706
00:38:18,999 --> 00:38:23,083
you just start doing it and you will gain stuff and I don't really know

707
00:38:23,083 --> 00:38:25,876
what the best thing to know.

708
00:38:25,918 --> 00:38:31,751
Especially if you get company, hands on real world experience you get

709
00:38:31,751 --> 00:38:35,250
whether it's a product development company

710
00:38:35,250 --> 00:38:38,083
or a specific product.

711
00:38:38,250 --> 00:38:39,709
Not consulting.

712
00:38:39,999 --> 00:38:42,167
That's where you get the best experience.

713
00:38:42,667 --> 00:38:45,167
As long as you love what you do and you learn more

714
00:38:45,167 --> 00:38:49,751
about the things you already said, it's a natural thing.

715
00:38:49,751 --> 00:38:52,792
I don't know if there's any better way to explain it.

716
00:38:52,792 --> 00:38:53,751
You know, I've been giving this answer a lot

717
00:38:53,751 --> 00:38:56,083
but it depends on the application.

718
00:38:57,501 --> 00:39:00,083
Obvious skill sets electronics if you're going

719
00:39:00,083 --> 00:39:03,999
to be doing microcontrollers as well, programming.

720
00:39:04,751 --> 00:39:08,167
Lower level the better, understanding of how assembly works is going

721
00:39:08,167 --> 00:39:09,999
to be important.

722
00:39:09,999 --> 00:39:11,209
I second that.

723
00:39:11,209 --> 00:39:13,417
Here's the big difference between embedded guys

724
00:39:13,417 --> 00:39:17,083
and you know, pure software, speaking as a hiring manager,

725
00:39:17,083 --> 00:39:21,125
here's a skill set I would list if I was doing the official thing

726
00:39:21,125 --> 00:39:25,542
and I'll tell you the kind of I people I really hire.

727
00:39:25,542 --> 00:39:29,459
But big difference, physics.

728
00:39:29,501 --> 00:39:33,542
Because okay, you're going to be turning motors and interfacing

729
00:39:33,542 --> 00:39:37,626
sensors and talking with people about this frequency of whatever

730
00:39:37,626 --> 00:39:42,584
or this coming in and I need to turn it in this real world thing and I'm going

731
00:39:42,584 --> 00:39:46,375
to turn it into software, understanding the physics is going

732
00:39:46,375 --> 00:39:50,542
to be more important than pushing packets around.

733
00:39:50,959 --> 00:39:53,292
When it comes down to hiring people, we had

734
00:39:53,292 --> 00:39:56,751
a kid what did you do last summer?

735
00:39:56,918 --> 00:40:00,626
I rebuilt this Chevy 350 just to understand it.

736
00:40:00,626 --> 00:40:01,667
Shit, you're hired.

737
00:40:01,667 --> 00:40:03,667
I want somebody who does hands on.

738
00:40:03,751 --> 00:40:06,542
In the embedded world you've got to touch the hardware.

739
00:40:06,542 --> 00:40:11,876
(Applause.)    The one big question: Have you ever brought

740
00:40:11,876 --> 00:40:14,584
up a new system?

741
00:40:15,167 --> 00:40:18,209
Because again, it goes back to what I said earlier

742
00:40:18,209 --> 00:40:20,501
about doing hardware.

743
00:40:20,667 --> 00:40:23,751
If your code doesn't work, you recompile.

744
00:40:24,042 --> 00:40:27,999
You've got a board, spent all this money.

745
00:40:27,999 --> 00:40:29,751
You laid the board out and put all your parts up there which

746
00:40:29,751 --> 00:40:31,626
is a fucked up mistake.

747
00:40:31,626 --> 00:40:35,292
You've got this board and turned it on and it doesn't work.

748
00:40:35,751 --> 00:40:37,709
Now what?

749
00:40:37,999 --> 00:40:38,999
You've got to understand what's going

750
00:40:38,999 --> 00:40:40,792
on on that board.

751
00:40:40,792 --> 00:40:42,626
It could be something like, again, physics, it could be you laid it

752
00:40:42,626 --> 00:40:44,999
out wrong and it ain't going to work.

753
00:40:44,999 --> 00:40:47,918
It could be chips not running, traces left off.

754
00:40:48,083 --> 00:40:49,083
Hands on.

755
00:40:52,999 --> 00:40:56,834
Being able to troubleshoot circuits is a huge skill that and

756
00:40:56,834 --> 00:40:59,999
like when I was teaching at the university, it used

757
00:40:59,999 --> 00:41:02,999
to frustrate me to no end, I was really honest

758
00:41:02,999 --> 00:41:06,792
with some students if they come to me and ask a question,

759
00:41:06,792 --> 00:41:10,083
I would always say have you tried it?

760
00:41:10,083 --> 00:41:12,918
Have you gone out tinkerers, we need more tinkerers.

761
00:41:12,918 --> 00:41:14,918
If they haven't tried it, you don't have the mindset

762
00:41:14,918 --> 00:41:17,542
to be doing this kind of work.

763
00:41:17,834 --> 00:41:21,083
To be blunt, we need more tinkerers.

764
00:41:21,083 --> 00:41:23,709
Right now we call them makers but we need more tinkerers,

765
00:41:23,709 --> 00:41:26,999
we need people putting their hands on stuff.

766
00:41:26,999 --> 00:41:29,709
I'm always championing in the embedded systems we teach kids

767
00:41:29,709 --> 00:41:33,834
that electronics are dangerous, expensive and breakable.

768
00:41:38,584 --> 00:41:41,083
In our community, just look at the participation

769
00:41:41,083 --> 00:41:43,876
in the badge stuff here at DEF CON, we have orders

770
00:41:43,876 --> 00:41:46,334
of magnitude more people involved in badge stuff

771
00:41:46,334 --> 00:41:49,083
if it's not electronic because people just have that

772
00:41:49,083 --> 00:41:52,999
intimidation factor that haven't made that first step.

773
00:41:52,999 --> 00:41:55,709
That's where we have the hardware hacking village.

774
00:41:55,709 --> 00:41:58,876
That's why DEF CON kids is doing electronic badges this year.

775
00:41:58,876 --> 00:41:59,751
We need to propagate and keep that momentum

776
00:41:59,751 --> 00:42:01,876
moving forward.

777
00:42:02,125 --> 00:42:03,999
AUDIENCE: Cool.

778
00:42:04,167 --> 00:42:05,167
Thank you.

779
00:42:05,167 --> 00:42:06,876
Just one thing, one more thing.

780
00:42:06,876 --> 00:42:11,083
When you're discussing about forgetting stuff for a beginner,

781
00:42:11,083 --> 00:42:16,334
we're discussing with Arduino or the thing which I wanted to know

782
00:42:16,334 --> 00:42:22,584
is I when I use Arduino, I have us used, I have got things done.

783
00:42:22,584 --> 00:42:27,375
But by doing it by using it more and more, getting deeper into it, it

784
00:42:27,375 --> 00:42:32,292
will give me the basic concept of you know, like which makes me

785
00:42:32,292 --> 00:42:37,584
if I get any new programmer, any new microcontroller in the future,

786
00:42:37,584 --> 00:42:40,334
I'll be able to hook up a programmer

787
00:42:40,334 --> 00:42:43,876
into it or something like that?

788
00:42:43,876 --> 00:42:47,167
I'm looking for some to get started in that way which makes me able

789
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:49,834
to later on work on my microcontrollers

790
00:42:49,834 --> 00:42:52,083
and not just Arduino.

791
00:42:52,959 --> 00:42:54,375
Pick one.

792
00:42:54,375 --> 00:42:57,626
They're all different in little ways and they're all the same.

793
00:43:36,999 --> 00:43:41,959
(Audio difficulty)    I have a barn full of that shit.

794
00:43:46,876 --> 00:43:50,334
I think one advantage of Arduino, I think the question was going

795
00:43:50,334 --> 00:43:54,083
from sort of like vendors going if one to the module down, you want

796
00:43:54,083 --> 00:43:57,626
to start working with more at a lower level.

797
00:43:57,709 --> 00:44:00,999
And that one thing with Arduino is and you see this a lot.

798
00:44:00,999 --> 00:44:04,792
The Arduino is the code working on the Atmel.

799
00:44:04,792 --> 00:44:07,292
You can start with the platform board and

800
00:44:07,292 --> 00:44:12,999
if you want to try to go a level down, you can take an Atmel LVR

801
00:44:12,999 --> 00:44:17,334
and load Arduino software on it and that you know,

802
00:44:17,334 --> 00:44:21,876
use that so it's slightly more refined.

803
00:44:22,083 --> 00:44:23,751
And then eventually you're going to want to get

804
00:44:23,751 --> 00:44:26,584
to the point where you have a microcontrollers or maybe you don't

805
00:44:26,584 --> 00:44:28,999
need to get to that point but you have a microcontroller

806
00:44:28,999 --> 00:44:31,667
with just the stuff you want and it's not a module but it's

807
00:44:31,667 --> 00:44:34,375
a refined product that's stuff you want.

808
00:44:34,375 --> 00:44:36,417
You can go the other way for those running

809
00:44:36,417 --> 00:44:40,459
the dark net game this year, the badges software was written

810
00:44:40,459 --> 00:44:45,083
in the Arduino IDE even though it's not Arduino itself.

811
00:44:46,375 --> 00:44:50,999
It's just a front for AVR GCC so it takes C++ code

812
00:44:50,999 --> 00:44:54,709
and turns it into Atmel code.

813
00:44:54,999 --> 00:44:57,876
And if you give it the right hardware files,

814
00:44:57,876 --> 00:45:01,626
you can find them online for the AT tiny 85, then you can use

815
00:45:01,626 --> 00:45:04,999
the Arduino IDE just because it is so incredibly simple

816
00:45:04,999 --> 00:45:07,999
and program nonArduino devices.

817
00:45:07,999 --> 00:45:09,292
By the way, if you haven't talked to the dark net guys, they did

818
00:45:09,292 --> 00:45:11,999
an amazing job this job and it's a great program.

819
00:45:11,999 --> 00:45:17,834
We have five minutes left and I want to bang

820
00:45:17,834 --> 00:45:24,667
through as many questions as we can here.

821
00:45:24,792 --> 00:45:26,083
Come on up.

822
00:45:26,083 --> 00:45:27,125
AUDIENCE: Hi.

823
00:45:27,125 --> 00:45:30,999
I started on the propeller and I'm still on it because I'm pretty addicted.

824
00:45:31,334 --> 00:45:34,751
So I've built a whole bunch of stuff.

825
00:45:34,751 --> 00:45:38,083
And they're all unique, they're all completely digital circuits.

826
00:45:38,083 --> 00:45:41,667
But I have a problem on one of my specifically where if I run it

827
00:45:41,667 --> 00:45:46,417
at 3.3 volts I get data corruption but when I drop it down to 2.8,

828
00:45:46,417 --> 00:45:48,709
everything works.

829
00:45:48,876 --> 00:45:52,292
So how would you go about starting to debug something like that.

830
00:45:52,292 --> 00:45:54,292
When you drop it works?

831
00:45:54,292 --> 00:45:55,999
AUDIENCE: Yeah, it's bizarre.

832
00:45:55,999 --> 00:45:56,999
That's fucked up.

833
00:45:58,459 --> 00:46:03,209
Look at the signals on the scope and see if you're actually getting noise

834
00:46:03,209 --> 00:46:06,417
outside the chip or if it's something being caused

835
00:46:06,417 --> 00:46:10,999
by overvoltage or something else inside the chip and make sure it's noise

836
00:46:10,999 --> 00:46:13,375
versus parity issues.

837
00:46:13,375 --> 00:46:16,083
Maybe there's some other weird configuration thing.

838
00:46:16,083 --> 00:46:19,375
It has an RF modules on it so noise is possible.

839
00:46:19,876 --> 00:46:25,834
Even something as strange as battery placement.

840
00:46:25,834 --> 00:46:26,999
AUDIENCE: Physics.

841
00:46:26,999 --> 00:46:28,501
It goes back to exactly what he was saying welcome to the world

842
00:46:28,501 --> 00:46:31,876
of hacking your circuit or troubleshooting.

843
00:46:31,876 --> 00:46:33,834
That's really one of the greatest skills that I think some

844
00:46:33,834 --> 00:46:36,167
people are    As soon as you start talking about RF,

845
00:46:36,167 --> 00:46:39,083
Ryan was mentioning one of the things you should mention learn

846
00:46:39,083 --> 00:46:40,751
is physics.

847
00:46:42,167 --> 00:46:45,834
I bet you have a trace somewhere that is exactly

848
00:46:45,834 --> 00:46:49,459
the length of your RF a quarter wave.

849
00:46:49,459 --> 00:46:52,751
Your quarter wavelength trace somewhere that's picking it up.

850
00:46:52,751 --> 00:46:55,083
You'll be able to visualize that on the scope.

851
00:46:55,459 --> 00:46:56,999
Scoping.

852
00:46:56,999 --> 00:46:59,999
Trying to troubleshoot a board without a scope is like trying

853
00:46:59,999 --> 00:47:02,918
to troubleshoot code without a debugger.

854
00:47:02,918 --> 00:47:04,999
It happens all the time.

855
00:47:04,999 --> 00:47:07,334
There's startups I've seen in San Francisco that kids have

856
00:47:07,334 --> 00:47:10,709
dropped out of school and move to California to start companies

857
00:47:10,709 --> 00:47:14,501
and they don't have a oscilloscope to do basic things.

858
00:47:16,709 --> 00:47:20,334
I brought a logic analyzer with me but that ain't going to help me.

859
00:47:20,792 --> 00:47:22,083
Yeah, probably not?

860
00:47:22,584 --> 00:47:24,999
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

861
00:47:24,999 --> 00:47:25,999
That's old school.

862
00:47:26,292 --> 00:47:31,083
AUDIENCE: Yeah, one question for one person up here.

863
00:47:31,083 --> 00:47:34,083
We'll just kind of keep the discussion going and Â¯.

864
00:47:34,083 --> 00:47:37,999
What's with the porn music.

865
00:47:39,209 --> 00:47:41,999
Are we done?

866
00:47:41,999 --> 00:47:45,209
Is that the get off stage music?

867
00:47:46,999 --> 00:47:48,918
Nice.

868
00:47:48,999 --> 00:47:50,999
I've got three more.

869
00:47:51,083 --> 00:47:52,209
Just keep going.

870
00:47:52,209 --> 00:47:53,667
One person one question.

871
00:47:53,918 --> 00:47:54,918
Lightning round.

872
00:47:54,918 --> 00:47:55,918
Go quickly.

873
00:47:55,918 --> 00:47:57,125
AUDIENCE: When you're making a decision designing

874
00:47:57,125 --> 00:48:00,459
an RF signal processing board, which point are you drawing

875
00:48:00,459 --> 00:48:05,459
the line between saying I'm going to use DSP or FPGA for this solution.

876
00:48:05,626 --> 00:48:07,125
Not me.

877
00:48:07,959 --> 00:48:09,999
I would lean toward the DSP just

878
00:48:09,999 --> 00:48:14,334
because FPGA when I think of FPGA, I think of hard care digital side

879
00:48:14,334 --> 00:48:18,999
of things and DSP might give you more I don't know, may be easier to kind

880
00:48:18,999 --> 00:48:23,167
of manipulate if that makes sense, you could always maybe port FPGA

881
00:48:23,167 --> 00:48:26,667
but I would tend to go with DSP first.

882
00:48:28,918 --> 00:48:31,375
AUDIENCE: I have an 11 year old boy who is come of age,

883
00:48:31,375 --> 00:48:34,417
what can I do to introduce them to this world?

884
00:48:34,417 --> 00:48:35,999
I don't have a lot of experience.

885
00:48:35,999 --> 00:48:38,375
Go get the -- what's a microcontroller kit.

886
00:48:38,375 --> 00:48:39,709
Get it at Radio Shack.

887
00:48:39,709 --> 00:48:41,209
The what he said.

888
00:48:41,209 --> 00:48:43,083
It's a parallax microcontroller.

889
00:48:43,083 --> 00:48:44,999
It comes with a huge book that was help move

890
00:48:44,999 --> 00:48:48,417
you forward and that's the difference between that product

891
00:48:48,417 --> 00:48:51,209
and any others is the supporting documentation

892
00:48:51,209 --> 00:48:53,584
is a no kidding book.

893
00:48:53,959 --> 00:48:54,999
Free sample.

894
00:48:54,999 --> 00:48:57,999
No, I don't work for parallax any more.

895
00:48:58,209 --> 00:49:01,667
But I still think it's a great way to introduce people to.

896
00:49:01,999 --> 00:49:04,876
I have a long list in my Palm Pilot.

897
00:49:06,292 --> 00:49:11,584
I'm a system engineer at mission critical embedded systems

898
00:49:11,584 --> 00:49:17,167
and I got started on 8080 in '76 so I'm an old fart.

899
00:49:20,918 --> 00:49:24,876
Two things I'd say is the tool chain, the Atmel and

900
00:49:24,876 --> 00:49:29,709
the Arduino gives you a solid reliable tool chain.

901
00:49:29,709 --> 00:49:31,959
Stay away from the CCS compiler.

902
00:49:31,959 --> 00:49:34,167
It should be checked into the heart of the sun I lost 60 hours of my life

903
00:49:34,167 --> 00:49:38,083
on a professional project because of the figuring CCS compiler.

904
00:49:38,959 --> 00:49:40,918
The other thing I'd say is learn C.

905
00:49:40,918 --> 00:49:42,250
Yeah.

906
00:49:42,250 --> 00:49:44,209
Yes.

907
00:49:44,709 --> 00:49:45,792
I second that.

908
00:49:45,792 --> 00:49:47,918
And keep your cold simple.

909
00:49:47,918 --> 00:49:51,999
I would say learn see and then learn assembly.

910
00:49:51,999 --> 00:49:55,375
And, to be fair, the CCS compiler is good for certain things.

911
00:49:55,375 --> 00:49:56,792
I found bugs in that too but when you do,

912
00:49:56,792 --> 00:49:59,167
you get free subscription.

913
00:49:59,999 --> 00:50:02,209
The natives are getting restless, they're going

914
00:50:02,209 --> 00:50:04,751
to start throwing spears at us.

915
00:50:04,751 --> 00:50:05,751
One comment.

916
00:50:05,959 --> 00:50:07,999
Tell everyone who is just a programmer do embedded

917
00:50:07,999 --> 00:50:09,709
systems stuff.

918
00:50:09,709 --> 00:50:11,375
It will change the way you program.

919
00:50:11,375 --> 00:50:14,083
Yeah, you know what the fuck the machine is doing.

920
00:50:14,083 --> 00:50:16,083
This one is awesome.

921
00:50:16,167 --> 00:50:17,167
Thank you.
