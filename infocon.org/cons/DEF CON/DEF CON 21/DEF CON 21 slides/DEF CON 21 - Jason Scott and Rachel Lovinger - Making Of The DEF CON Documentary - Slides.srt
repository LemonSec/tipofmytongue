1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,459
JASON SCOTT: Hello, everybody, I'm Jason Scott I'm the director

2
00:00:03,459 --> 00:00:05,918
of the DEF CON documentary.

3
00:00:05,918 --> 00:00:08,626
RACHEL LOVINGER: And I'm Rachel Lovinger the producer

4
00:00:08,626 --> 00:00:11,292
of the DEF CON documentary.

5
00:00:11,918 --> 00:00:15,999
JASON SCOTT: So we are going to talk about how we ended

6
00:00:15,999 --> 00:00:20,125
up with this project in our hands, what we learned,

7
00:00:20,125 --> 00:00:23,959
along with hopefully at the end bonus footage

8
00:00:23,959 --> 00:00:28,918
and strange stuff that didn't get into the documentary and or

9
00:00:28,918 --> 00:00:34,584
in some cases doesn't exist anywhere except for this room.

10
00:00:34,959 --> 00:00:38,292
So let's get started with the fun!

11
00:00:38,626 --> 00:00:42,000
So basically what happened was, last February I was on a trip

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
with Rachel in Helsinki and she was at a presentation for a conference

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,751
and I said I want to go too, I'm doing documentaries of my own.

14
00:00:55,999 --> 00:01:01,959
So I had the smallest set up there and it is freakin' cold in Helsinki.

15
00:01:02,125 --> 00:01:07,999
When I wanted to interview people they would say "you're going

16
00:01:07,999 --> 00:01:11,209
to come here, I'm not going outside"

17
00:01:11,209 --> 00:01:15,999
and we get a phone call from Russ Rogers of DEF CON

18
00:01:15,999 --> 00:01:19,999
and through a Skype call I talked to him and

19
00:01:19,999 --> 00:01:24,459
he put forward this interesting idea.

20
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:26,709
He said we're coming up on the 20th DEF CON

21
00:01:26,709 --> 00:01:30,876
and I said "great" and he said "and we've been thinking we

22
00:01:30,876 --> 00:01:34,167
want to do a documentary about it.

23
00:01:34,459 --> 00:01:37,584
I can think of no finer person than yourself."

24
00:01:37,876 --> 00:01:42,292
I said and he was like "and we'll pay you" (Laughter.)

25
00:01:42,292 --> 00:01:48,876
Now, I'd been attendee at DEF CON for basically since 1999.

26
00:01:48,876 --> 00:01:51,918
I gave a presentation there about running textfiles.com,

27
00:01:51,918 --> 00:01:56,125
the web site that I run and I have progressively spoken pretty

28
00:01:56,125 --> 00:02:00,626
much every year since then with a few exceptions so I have been

29
00:02:00,626 --> 00:02:04,876
to many of the DEF CONs, I think I missed one, so I was part

30
00:02:04,876 --> 00:02:08,999
of the group, I knew what it was, but I was also well aware

31
00:02:08,999 --> 00:02:12,083
of the rule that there are no cameras running

32
00:02:12,083 --> 00:02:15,667
around taking pictures of everybody!

33
00:02:15,667 --> 00:02:17,999
And that tell be punched in the face!

34
00:02:17,999 --> 00:02:22,459
So the problem here was, you know, we have this wonderful event

35
00:02:22,459 --> 00:02:25,709
and didn't to take on that pain?

36
00:02:25,876 --> 00:02:28,999
Then Russ mentioned the money again (Laughter.) And

37
00:02:28,999 --> 00:02:33,167
the funny part was I came up with, okay, this is what I would do it

38
00:02:33,167 --> 00:02:36,999
for and it was like that on the button and I was like, okay,

39
00:02:36,999 --> 00:02:39,375
you know me very well.

40
00:02:39,626 --> 00:02:41,999
So I said, I think I shall do this.

41
00:02:41,999 --> 00:02:47,584
And bear in mind I was shooting three other document tears at the time.

42
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:50,751
We will talk about how I handled that, I was busy,

43
00:02:50,751 --> 00:02:54,125
it wasn't my first documentary.

44
00:02:54,834 --> 00:02:58,542
I made two other documentaries that people have seen, one called "BBS

45
00:02:58,542 --> 00:03:01,417
the Documentary" which is about computerized bulletin

46
00:03:01,417 --> 00:03:03,125
board systems.

47
00:03:03,125 --> 00:03:06,209
That one took four years, had 205 hours of footage, ended

48
00:03:06,209 --> 00:03:10,167
up being 7 hours split across eight episodes.

49
00:03:10,167 --> 00:03:12,083
And then GIT Lamp, because I thought VBS was way

50
00:03:12,083 --> 00:03:13,792
too general.

51
00:03:14,999 --> 00:03:20,999
I made a high definition documentary about text adventures, and I went

52
00:03:20,999 --> 00:03:24,459
out and interviewed people from Info Con,

53
00:03:24,459 --> 00:03:29,626
and that one took 4 hours, had 120 hours of interviews, went

54
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:34,999
out very well, in 2010, so I had decided to do more.

55
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:37,667
I had some experience with technical document tears

56
00:03:37,667 --> 00:03:39,417
and making things about computer people

57
00:03:39,417 --> 00:03:42,584
and getting people who weren't used to cameras to talk on the camera

58
00:03:42,584 --> 00:03:43,999
and so on.

59
00:03:43,999 --> 00:03:47,375
So I had that experience and I had done a kick starter.

60
00:03:49,626 --> 00:03:54,250
So, yeah, signed on, went for it, but there were some fundamental

61
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:57,918
issues that I wanted to know about.

62
00:03:57,999 --> 00:04:01,959
The thing was, I knew my previously films had been

63
00:04:01,959 --> 00:04:06,999
about subjects that were general like text adventures, I'll talk

64
00:04:06,999 --> 00:04:12,417
to people about text adventures until I have so much footage I'll do

65
00:04:12,417 --> 00:04:16,292
a movie about it and same with bullet tin boards,

66
00:04:16,292 --> 00:04:21,334
but this was about four or five days and is filmed in Las Vegas

67
00:04:21,334 --> 00:04:24,584
and then never happens again, it's a lot

68
00:04:24,584 --> 00:04:29,999
of pressure and completely different than how I make my films so how

69
00:04:29,999 --> 00:04:33,667
the hell are we going to do that?

70
00:04:33,918 --> 00:04:36,626
How about the fact that nobody wants to be filmed!

71
00:04:39,292 --> 00:04:43,999
Traditionally people have been driven away for doing sweeps, for screaming,

72
00:04:43,999 --> 00:04:47,501
there has been stories of people talking one person talked

73
00:04:47,501 --> 00:04:50,709
about he was running a booth and how he was talking

74
00:04:50,709 --> 00:04:54,999
to one of the Goons and suddenly the Goon said "you will stop that on!"

75
00:04:54,999 --> 00:04:57,667
And who was he yelling at?

76
00:04:57,667 --> 00:05:03,292
Somebody in one of the sky boxes in the old Riviera aiming

77
00:05:03,292 --> 00:05:06,292
down at the booth.

78
00:05:06,626 --> 00:05:08,250
So they were strict about "let's not get

79
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:12,999
with the cameras" and now they're saying "let's film everything" ?

80
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:15,375
So that was a nightmare to consider.

81
00:05:15,918 --> 00:05:20,083
And finally how do I make it not suck?

82
00:05:20,626 --> 00:05:22,876
How do I make a film that's not going to be looking

83
00:05:22,876 --> 00:05:25,834
like something that G4 shit out in four days?

84
00:05:27,626 --> 00:05:30,250
(Laughter.) How am I going to bring something special

85
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:32,959
to it and put a movie together.

86
00:05:33,501 --> 00:05:37,959
Originally it was going to I'm going to direct this and Rachel was

87
00:05:37,959 --> 00:05:40,999
like "I'm going to help you"    RACHEL LOVINGER:

88
00:05:40,999 --> 00:05:43,751
(Away from mic.)    JASON SCOTT: I know,

89
00:05:43,751 --> 00:05:48,083
but she said "I'll help you do this and we'll approach it together

90
00:05:48,083 --> 00:05:50,375
from the beginning."

91
00:05:50,375 --> 00:05:53,876
Like this wasn't where I got weird and I said "what do I do?"

92
00:05:53,876 --> 00:05:58,334
And she was like "oh, I want a piece of this" and she reminded me

93
00:05:58,334 --> 00:06:03,876
she had a degree in film and maybe she wants to help with this.

94
00:06:03,999 --> 00:06:06,751
Finally, how do you do it in six months

95
00:06:06,751 --> 00:06:10,542
because they wanted me to release the film on Christmas

96
00:06:10,542 --> 00:06:13,083
as a Christmas present to the "gang!"

97
00:06:13,083 --> 00:06:17,167
How am I going to shoot a film where we have less than that

98
00:06:17,167 --> 00:06:20,626
to film, edit and put it together?

99
00:06:23,584 --> 00:06:27,375
We ended up moving straight into planning and I'm going

100
00:06:27,375 --> 00:06:31,709
to let Rachel describe her thought process on how she started

101
00:06:31,709 --> 00:06:36,751
to bring this together for this unbelievably huge project.

102
00:06:36,751 --> 00:06:40,083
RACHEL LOVINGER: There is me in Helsinki.

103
00:06:40,209 --> 00:06:45,083
It was very cold as Jason said.

104
00:06:45,083 --> 00:06:48,417
One of the reasons I thought I could help without with this is I

105
00:06:48,417 --> 00:06:51,751
like planning and I really like documentaries and I

106
00:06:51,751 --> 00:06:54,375
like planning things so this is an example

107
00:06:54,375 --> 00:06:56,999
of a spreadsheet that I made at my office

108
00:06:56,999 --> 00:06:59,667
at work I show a documentary once a month

109
00:06:59,667 --> 00:07:04,334
and my colleague and I brainstormed the kind of documentaries that we want

110
00:07:04,334 --> 00:07:05,999
to show.

111
00:07:05,999 --> 00:07:07,792
We have a list of enough documentaries we could

112
00:07:07,792 --> 00:07:10,876
show once a month for, like, seven years.

113
00:07:10,999 --> 00:07:15,459
We tracked which ones we have seen, what they're about, how long they are,

114
00:07:15,459 --> 00:07:17,375
all that stuff.

115
00:07:17,375 --> 00:07:20,167
Just to give you an example that I like planning things!

116
00:07:20,167 --> 00:07:23,250
JASON SCOTT: She really likes planning things.

117
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:25,250
RACHEL LOVINGER: I've been to DEF CON a few times

118
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:28,999
before that so I had some idea what to expect.

119
00:07:29,125 --> 00:07:31,209
That, I think, was helpful.

120
00:07:31,417 --> 00:07:33,999
I've known Jason for a long time.

121
00:07:34,167 --> 00:07:40,999
So that's his senior year high school yearbook photo and I took that!

122
00:07:42,834 --> 00:07:46,083
JASON SCOTT: Quickly for this gang, so what do you pose

123
00:07:46,083 --> 00:07:49,834
with to somehow your fine times in high school?

124
00:07:49,999 --> 00:07:56,417
Your Roger Waters radio chaos album, you can see my figment cap

125
00:07:56,417 --> 00:08:01,626
from when they used to sell those in Epcot Center,

126
00:08:01,626 --> 00:08:07,501
a stolen highway flasher, a stolen pay phone, just there,

127
00:08:07,501 --> 00:08:13,250
just evidence thrown into my high school yearbook photo,

128
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:20,626
and then, of course, holding in my hand a linemen's test set.

129
00:08:20,626 --> 00:08:22,584
This is basically an evidence photo.

130
00:08:22,584 --> 00:08:24,709
RACHEL LOVINGER: And the dust buster.

131
00:08:24,709 --> 00:08:26,459
JASON SCOTT: And the dust buster.

132
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:27,999
Right.

133
00:08:27,999 --> 00:08:29,584
There are five photos in the yearbook, and in each

134
00:08:29,584 --> 00:08:32,584
of the photos I'm holding a dust buster, why?

135
00:08:32,709 --> 00:08:33,709
'Cuz I could!

136
00:08:33,999 --> 00:08:37,125
RACHEL LOVINGER: We had a very permissive high school!

137
00:08:38,334 --> 00:08:41,999
So the first question we set out to tackle was how are we going

138
00:08:41,999 --> 00:08:44,999
to film this in this constrained period of time and

139
00:08:44,999 --> 00:08:48,083
of course we realized there is no way between the two

140
00:08:48,083 --> 00:08:52,083
of us we could film everything we need to bring on additional people

141
00:08:52,083 --> 00:08:55,709
to have multiple cameras in multiple places.

142
00:08:55,751 --> 00:08:58,209
So Jason mention he had this kick starter, he put

143
00:08:58,209 --> 00:09:01,751
out a call to his kick starter backers.

144
00:09:01,999 --> 00:09:05,083
JASON SCOTT: So here I'd made this thing called

145
00:09:05,083 --> 00:09:08,501
the "three pack" I'm going to make three documentaries,

146
00:09:08,501 --> 00:09:10,542
will you fund it?

147
00:09:10,542 --> 00:09:14,417
And kick starter gave me shit at the time, you're asking

148
00:09:14,417 --> 00:09:20,459
for a thousand dollars and you're not going to get that and you don't have

149
00:09:20,459 --> 00:09:23,459
any rewards under $100 and my counter

150
00:09:23,459 --> 00:09:29,876
is I'm changing nothing and we're going to put it up anyway and it got $40,000

151
00:09:29,876 --> 00:09:33,584
in 24 hours so I knew my audience.

152
00:09:33,626 --> 00:09:36,626
I have a strong connection to this audience.

153
00:09:36,626 --> 00:09:38,792
They know I work hard on these films, they know why I want to make them

154
00:09:38,792 --> 00:09:40,501
and what I'm about.

155
00:09:40,792 --> 00:09:44,999
And I felt bad that I might take on this other film so I turned it

156
00:09:44,999 --> 00:09:49,999
around and said instead, guess what, you get another film for the amount

157
00:09:49,999 --> 00:09:55,083
of money you put in and you're going to get advance notice of the pieces

158
00:09:55,083 --> 00:09:57,999
in it and everything else.

159
00:09:57,999 --> 00:09:59,083
So I had to turn it around into actually this

160
00:09:59,083 --> 00:10:02,999
is a good thing plus I get more practice and in some ways I get more equipment

161
00:10:02,999 --> 00:10:04,667
that will help.

162
00:10:04,667 --> 00:10:07,999
So that was how I mitigated it, people were excited.

163
00:10:08,459 --> 00:10:10,626
Is this where I mention the recruitment?

164
00:10:10,626 --> 00:10:11,999
RACHEL LOVINGER: Yeah.

165
00:10:11,999 --> 00:10:14,375
JASON SCOTT: So what I did was, I said, I need crew,

166
00:10:14,375 --> 00:10:18,209
if you were supporting the Jason Scott documentary,

167
00:10:18,209 --> 00:10:21,876
did you want to make one with him?

168
00:10:22,042 --> 00:10:24,584
And a bunch of people jumped forward

169
00:10:24,584 --> 00:10:28,542
and said "sure" with no information!

170
00:10:28,584 --> 00:10:33,042
RACHEL LOVINGER: I think you told them we will fly you out there

171
00:10:33,042 --> 00:10:36,125
and it's a sit ton of work!

172
00:10:36,125 --> 00:10:40,667
JASON SCOTT: I didn't even tell them that, I just told them it was

173
00:10:40,667 --> 00:10:44,999
a shit ton of work, I didn't make it clear we were going

174
00:10:44,999 --> 00:10:49,667
to pay for anything because I didn't want them treating it

175
00:10:49,667 --> 00:10:53,417
as a free trip to Vegas, and I said did you want

176
00:10:53,417 --> 00:10:57,999
in and we had eight people sign up and I chose what ended

177
00:10:57,999 --> 00:11:00,999
up being five, and I had one person bow

178
00:11:00,999 --> 00:11:04,999
out because of work commitments, no hard feelings

179
00:11:04,999 --> 00:11:10,501
with him and I had four people from my kick starter group who literally

180
00:11:10,501 --> 00:11:15,999
the way I met them in a few cases was when they flew here.

181
00:11:17,626 --> 00:11:20,999
RACHEL LOVINGER: Welcome back to them, too.

182
00:11:20,999 --> 00:11:24,375
So once we knew we would have multiple people filming, we tried

183
00:11:24,375 --> 00:11:27,999
to figure out what we wanted to cover.

184
00:11:27,999 --> 00:11:31,083
So we poured through the schedule.

185
00:11:31,876 --> 00:11:35,834
We knew we weren't going to focus so much on filming the talks,

186
00:11:35,834 --> 00:11:39,584
a lot of those are filmed anyway, it was more helpful looking

187
00:11:39,584 --> 00:11:43,709
into the forums where we got information about all of the parties

188
00:11:43,709 --> 00:11:47,250
and the contests and the events and the unofficial as well

189
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:51,501
as the official events and where they were going to be and starting

190
00:11:51,501 --> 00:11:54,417
and that was incredibly useful.

191
00:11:54,417 --> 00:11:56,999
JASON SCOTT: Anybody who uses DEF CON or goes

192
00:11:56,999 --> 00:12:01,999
to DEF CON I'm sure you know there are places you go to and you walk

193
00:12:01,999 --> 00:12:06,375
by and you hear someone saying I'm doing an Easter egg contest

194
00:12:06,375 --> 00:12:11,459
and you're like, well, for you or you don't do it and you go "shit ya"

195
00:12:11,459 --> 00:12:14,125
and there are so many for whom DEF CON

196
00:12:14,125 --> 00:12:17,375
is a limited experience and we had to become

197
00:12:17,375 --> 00:12:20,584
the omniscient awareness pack of all aspects

198
00:12:20,584 --> 00:12:24,125
of DEF CON 20 everything from like how do they set

199
00:12:24,125 --> 00:12:27,334
up the rooms through to every event that was

200
00:12:27,334 --> 00:12:31,209
peripherally being planned in the forums, because some

201
00:12:31,209 --> 00:12:36,292
of them are liquid in the beginning like I'm thinking of doing a thing

202
00:12:36,292 --> 00:12:40,999
and I think I got someone to tell me it was okay, gotta get 'em

203
00:12:40,999 --> 00:12:44,250
on the list all right guy with thing you may be

204
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:46,626
a movie star soon!

205
00:12:46,626 --> 00:12:47,542
So that was a very strange experience

206
00:12:47,542 --> 00:12:49,959
to pull that much together.

207
00:12:49,959 --> 00:12:52,999
RACHEL LOVINGER: So we pulled that all together into this, again,

208
00:12:52,999 --> 00:12:57,083
a spreadsheet and we captured, you know, what things were happening,

209
00:12:57,083 --> 00:13:00,501
when and where they were going to be and tried to sketch

210
00:13:00,501 --> 00:13:04,834
out the things that we think we wanted to film about this event to sort

211
00:13:04,834 --> 00:13:07,584
of in order to tell the story.

212
00:13:07,584 --> 00:13:09,709
Some of these are going to be things that are happening

213
00:13:09,709 --> 00:13:13,250
all week end so we know we want to be there when Jeff explains what

214
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:15,999
the tamper evident contest is.

215
00:13:15,999 --> 00:13:18,999
JASON SCOTT: This thing is a fantastic document.

216
00:13:18,999 --> 00:13:20,792
This is Rachel's work and part of her professional job

217
00:13:20,792 --> 00:13:23,083
is constructing data in the a way that makes sense

218
00:13:23,083 --> 00:13:25,584
and understanding the underlying pieces of it and

219
00:13:25,584 --> 00:13:27,709
she is very good at it.

220
00:13:28,459 --> 00:13:31,876
We had a real gift here because if you look at it, there

221
00:13:31,876 --> 00:13:35,626
is a color code to go indicate whether we get in trouble if this

222
00:13:35,626 --> 00:13:38,792
is not filmed down to if the camera swings across it,

223
00:13:38,792 --> 00:13:40,959
everything is good!

224
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:44,292
Then followed by, what's the narrative?

225
00:13:44,999 --> 00:13:48,834
What's the narrative of the toxic BBQ, what is the story that needs

226
00:13:48,834 --> 00:13:51,292
to be told about a speaker?

227
00:13:51,375 --> 00:13:55,959
Followed by, who do we think are the players in the story?

228
00:13:55,959 --> 00:13:59,167
Do we know who the organizers are and the big people are and finally notes

229
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:01,834
where I write "I don't understand anything!"

230
00:14:01,834 --> 00:14:04,584
And everything else on the side.

231
00:14:04,584 --> 00:14:06,292
This goes on we only have one slide

232
00:14:06,292 --> 00:14:10,999
but it goes on for, like, a dozen pages at least.

233
00:14:10,999 --> 00:14:13,999
It's a huge, massive document.

234
00:14:13,999 --> 00:14:16,542
RACHEL LOVINGER: And there is also it highlighted things we didn't

235
00:14:16,542 --> 00:14:19,876
know and then we would reach out to Pyro or Russ and ask people,

236
00:14:19,876 --> 00:14:22,083
what's going on with this?

237
00:14:22,083 --> 00:14:24,459
Is the beard contest happening this week and.

238
00:14:24,459 --> 00:14:27,417
JASON SCOTT: That's how we found out the Cannon Ball Run wasn't

239
00:14:27,417 --> 00:14:32,167
happening and we would get surprised there were other things happening

240
00:14:32,167 --> 00:14:35,292
and this was our secret weapon.

241
00:14:35,292 --> 00:14:39,083
One of the secret weapons is, why is the work?

242
00:14:39,083 --> 00:14:44,584
Here it is, screaming work, months of screaming work trying to track

243
00:14:44,584 --> 00:14:50,334
down who is this, so we had the "Bible" that DEF CON doesn't have

244
00:14:50,334 --> 00:14:53,292
as to what DEF CON is.

245
00:14:53,292 --> 00:14:54,709
As a reference document.

246
00:14:54,709 --> 00:14:56,334
The encyclopedia of DEF CON.

247
00:14:56,334 --> 00:15:01,375
RACHEL LOVINGER: That got us as prepared as we can about the event.

248
00:15:01,542 --> 00:15:05,083
The next question we tried to tackle is how are we going to film everyone,

249
00:15:05,083 --> 00:15:08,083
film an audience of people that doesn't necessarily want

250
00:15:08,083 --> 00:15:12,250
to be filmed or hasn't traditionally wanted to be filmed.

251
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:13,999
We went through a number of ideas.

252
00:15:13,999 --> 00:15:17,667
We had an idea to give out paper masks    JASON SCOTT: We

253
00:15:17,667 --> 00:15:20,959
were going to give out we proposed things one

254
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:24,999
of them was maybe a paper mask with at the point anonymous

255
00:15:24,999 --> 00:15:29,999
or another one that people could hold up when the cameras went by and

256
00:15:29,999 --> 00:15:33,334
the response was "no fucking way are you going

257
00:15:33,334 --> 00:15:35,459
to give 15,000 people masks!"

258
00:15:35,459 --> 00:15:40,709
RACHEL LOVINGER: So instead we decided to make ourselves identifiable

259
00:15:40,709 --> 00:15:44,667
and anyone would be able to see us coming and could get

260
00:15:44,667 --> 00:15:49,375
out of the way or indicate they were not interested.

261
00:15:49,375 --> 00:15:54,125
So our first idea was we would get orange jump suits and we realized that.

262
00:15:54,999 --> 00:15:58,125
JASON SCOTT: We would have only three crew members at the end

263
00:15:58,125 --> 00:16:00,250
in 104 degree weather.

264
00:16:01,918 --> 00:16:07,459
RACHEL LOVINGER: So we went instead with these mesh orange vests

265
00:16:07,459 --> 00:16:10,584
Jason will show off here!

266
00:16:10,999 --> 00:16:14,501
They have lots of nice pockets in them for carrying things

267
00:16:14,501 --> 00:16:18,417
and we spray painted the logo and the word "documentary"

268
00:16:18,417 --> 00:16:22,999
on them so there would be no question who we were.

269
00:16:23,375 --> 00:16:25,999
The side benefit of this was we were really easy

270
00:16:25,999 --> 00:16:29,751
to spot by each other so if we were, like, we're looking

271
00:16:29,751 --> 00:16:33,626
for a crew member we could always find them.

272
00:16:33,626 --> 00:16:35,999
You'll see them throughout the film, actually.

273
00:16:35,999 --> 00:16:38,626
JASON SCOTT: To this day I will see people

274
00:16:38,626 --> 00:16:42,292
in these and go "I wonder what they're filming?"

275
00:16:42,292 --> 00:16:47,999
RACHEL LOVINGER: Then we entered the preproduction stage.

276
00:16:47,999 --> 00:16:54,125
So I wanted to call out to Russ Rogers, he was our primary liaison,

277
00:16:54,125 --> 00:17:01,334
so Russ and Dartangen were executive producers but Russ was our day

278
00:17:01,334 --> 00:17:08,667
to day contact, if we had questions, beforehand, while we were here,

279
00:17:08,667 --> 00:17:11,209
he was our guy.

280
00:17:11,209 --> 00:17:13,999
JASON SCOTT: Russ and I talked when all was said

281
00:17:13,999 --> 00:17:17,292
and Don I think Russ and I talked for roughly

282
00:17:17,292 --> 00:17:23,083
between 100 and 200 hours over the past 18 months, just over time.

283
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:23,626
He was "there!"

284
00:17:23,626 --> 00:17:28,584
Every time to give me heads up, tell me something is going o

285
00:17:28,584 --> 00:17:32,375
to get back to me on every aspect.

286
00:17:32,751 --> 00:17:35,999
You know, this isn't something where it says "executive producer"

287
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:39,834
and that means they wrote the check, literally this guy was working

288
00:17:39,834 --> 00:17:43,375
on it equally as hard as me, especially some months, especially

289
00:17:43,375 --> 00:17:46,999
as we started to move toward where is this thing going to end

290
00:17:46,999 --> 00:17:51,125
up and how are we going to publish it, he was right there.

291
00:17:51,542 --> 00:17:55,334
He's not here right now, I don't think, but believe me, he was as critical

292
00:17:55,334 --> 00:17:58,250
as any other component, this guy.

293
00:17:58,375 --> 00:18:02,709
RACHEL LOVINGER: So then we had our crew.

294
00:18:02,709 --> 00:18:04,375
So we want to introduce you to them.

295
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:06,250
These are the six guys and then Jason

296
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:07,999
and myself.

297
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:11,083
These are the photos that we sent to the Goons, the security Goons, so

298
00:18:11,083 --> 00:18:14,167
in addition to having our vests they wanted to make sure

299
00:18:14,167 --> 00:18:19,083
they knew what our crew looked like so nobody could intern nature us.

300
00:18:19,083 --> 00:18:22,209
JASON SCOTT: So there wouldn't be a documentary crew within six house

301
00:18:22,209 --> 00:18:25,999
of a documentary crew running around roughshod.

302
00:18:25,999 --> 00:18:28,999
RACHEL LOVINGER: I don't think anybody impersonated us.

303
00:18:29,083 --> 00:18:31,542
JASON SCOTT: I don't think so.

304
00:18:36,334 --> 00:18:38,999
Somebody with an orange shirt was a dick

305
00:18:38,999 --> 00:18:41,667
and somebody was like, the documentary crew

306
00:18:41,667 --> 00:18:45,501
is harassing me and it was like, no, they don't have the time

307
00:18:45,501 --> 00:18:47,667
to harass anybody!

308
00:18:48,417 --> 00:18:51,999
And I mentioned this to one of the Goons and they said "welcome

309
00:18:51,999 --> 00:18:54,584
to our world and everyone who as a red shirt!"

310
00:18:54,584 --> 00:18:56,999
RACHEL LOVINGER: So I looked back on it,

311
00:18:56,999 --> 00:19:00,834
we gave them shockingly little preparation for what they were going

312
00:19:00,834 --> 00:19:03,834
to experience at DEF CON, especially considering most

313
00:19:03,834 --> 00:19:06,999
of them had never been to DEF CON and now we were asking

314
00:19:06,999 --> 00:19:09,918
them to cover everything about it.

315
00:19:09,999 --> 00:19:14,876
One thing we did ask them was to watch Morgan Sperlock's Comic Con

316
00:19:14,876 --> 00:19:17,999
documentary came out and we knew this was

317
00:19:17,999 --> 00:19:23,417
a good example of what it's like to try to capture on film an event

318
00:19:23,417 --> 00:19:27,959
with massive amounts of people and tons of things going

319
00:19:27,959 --> 00:19:32,584
on at once so we said "watch that and you will have a sense

320
00:19:32,584 --> 00:19:37,167
of what you're in for," and aside from that we wanted them

321
00:19:37,167 --> 00:19:40,375
to be comfortable and safe.

322
00:19:40,959 --> 00:19:42,459
JASON SCOTT: Yeah.

323
00:19:42,459 --> 00:19:44,542
And I do say, I admit Morgan I met Morgan

324
00:19:44,542 --> 00:19:48,667
at a conference and we recognized each other and he was

325
00:19:48,667 --> 00:19:51,626
at a presentation of Comic Con episode 4

326
00:19:51,626 --> 00:19:56,417
and we went there and watched it and said "somebody did something

327
00:19:56,417 --> 00:20:01,042
I want to do" and we watched it and I went and asked them a lot

328
00:20:01,042 --> 00:20:04,584
of way too technical questions personally when

329
00:20:04,584 --> 00:20:08,999
they were just chatting, not Q and A, and I have a question,

330
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:13,959
it was "please teach me how to film" but I did get hints from him

331
00:20:13,959 --> 00:20:19,083
and what they were shooting for and they did open my mind.

332
00:20:19,083 --> 00:20:21,292
They came up with ideas that they never had work, and I wanted

333
00:20:21,292 --> 00:20:24,584
to mention one, because it's kind of brilliant.

334
00:20:24,584 --> 00:20:26,250
RACHEL LOVINGER: Oh, yeah.

335
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:30,918
JASON SCOTT: They do a story arc, more than what I would do,

336
00:20:30,918 --> 00:20:35,709
"I'm going to be at Comic Con and here is my story" and

337
00:20:35,709 --> 00:20:41,000
they sent crews to those people, 8 or 9 of them and they ended

338
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,834
up with this story.

339
00:20:45,209 --> 00:20:49,918
What they wanted to do, Comic Con is a massive    RACHEL LOVINGER:

340
00:20:49,918 --> 00:20:52,999
It's three football fields long.

341
00:20:53,542 --> 00:20:59,792
JASON SCOTT: He wanted a Super Bowl cam and you would follow

342
00:20:59,792 --> 00:21:04,918
someone's story and they would walk out on the floor

343
00:21:04,918 --> 00:21:10,834
and a camera would pile back and zoom down Comic Con's floor

344
00:21:10,834 --> 00:21:17,334
as a transition and when he got there they were like "no!

345
00:21:17,334 --> 00:21:21,125
There is no line of sight anywhere in the Comic Con floor that does that" .

346
00:21:21,125 --> 00:21:23,999
RACHEL LOVINGER: He could have done that with drones.

347
00:21:23,999 --> 00:21:26,501
JASON SCOTT: That's the next thing they want

348
00:21:26,501 --> 00:21:29,999
is helicopter drones, flying over people

349
00:21:29,999 --> 00:21:37,375
with massive banners so it looks like Star Wars, episode 4 trench scene.

350
00:21:37,375 --> 00:21:38,792
RACHEL LOVINGER: Nice.

351
00:21:38,918 --> 00:21:42,918
JASON SCOTT: But he was thinking out of the box, too,

352
00:21:42,918 --> 00:21:46,999
and it was inspiring so thanks, Morgan.

353
00:21:47,751 --> 00:21:52,999
RACHEL LOVINGER: We had one ringer, a person on our crew,

354
00:21:52,999 --> 00:21:58,375
Eddie Cudall, he is a professional as well and he has done a lot

355
00:21:58,375 --> 00:22:04,083
of work with Boing Boing TV and Maker Bot TV and he's filmed south

356
00:22:04,083 --> 00:22:09,125
by southwest and he's used to being dropped into situations

357
00:22:09,125 --> 00:22:12,667
and being able to handle it.

358
00:22:12,667 --> 00:22:16,584
JASON SCOTT: We wanted a clutch in case it got hot.

359
00:22:16,626 --> 00:22:19,626
Because there were unknowns, we want to send a guy

360
00:22:19,626 --> 00:22:23,417
in who has filmed these things and who is going to hold

361
00:22:23,417 --> 00:22:26,709
the camera steady so if we really need footage

362
00:22:26,709 --> 00:22:30,999
and we're scared and everyone is falling apart, we know Eddie

363
00:22:30,999 --> 00:22:33,250
will barrel through.

364
00:22:33,626 --> 00:22:36,751
So that was just us, taking a little precaution for the good

365
00:22:36,751 --> 00:22:40,083
and I insisted he be paid at close to his regular rate and treated

366
00:22:40,083 --> 00:22:43,834
like this was a professional not "hey, buddy, come in and do hard work

367
00:22:43,834 --> 00:22:45,292
for free" .

368
00:22:45,292 --> 00:22:48,999
RACHEL LOVINGER: I think we made him sleep on the floor, though.

369
00:22:48,999 --> 00:22:50,125
JASON SCOTT: We did.

370
00:22:51,792 --> 00:22:53,999
AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Away from mic.)    JASON SCOTT: A

371
00:22:53,999 --> 00:22:55,542
little tired.

372
00:22:55,542 --> 00:22:56,542
Eddie is here!

373
00:22:56,542 --> 00:22:59,959
RACHEL LOVINGER: Why don't you tell them about the equipment.

374
00:22:59,959 --> 00:23:01,792
JASON SCOTT: Where are you going to go when you're putting this

375
00:23:01,792 --> 00:23:03,334
thing together?

376
00:23:03,999 --> 00:23:06,999
A lot of people when they see a movie there is a certain range

377
00:23:06,999 --> 00:23:09,792
of people whose response is "tell me every last piece

378
00:23:09,792 --> 00:23:11,667
of equipment you use to make this film

379
00:23:11,667 --> 00:23:14,584
because that's what we all like to do.

380
00:23:14,999 --> 00:23:19,167
I know a number of film makers who also make geek

381
00:23:19,167 --> 00:23:23,999
documentaries and after I got my kick starter money I sat

382
00:23:23,999 --> 00:23:27,999
down with them, Paul Of Two player Productions,

383
00:23:27,999 --> 00:23:33,209
they have done Moshang, the story of MindCraft, they have done

384
00:23:33,209 --> 00:23:36,584
the 8 bit movie about chip tune artists

385
00:23:36,584 --> 00:23:42,292
and I have become good friends with James Swirsky and Lisanne Pajot,

386
00:23:42,292 --> 00:23:47,999
the creators of" Indie Game: The Movie "and I did a call with them,

387
00:23:47,999 --> 00:23:51,334
your cam remarks what is it?

388
00:23:51,375 --> 00:23:55,999
Your sound, what was it how did you get this shot?

389
00:23:55,999 --> 00:23:57,918
What lens did you buy?

390
00:23:57,999 --> 00:24:00,542
And shopping list, shopping list, shopping list, shopping list

391
00:24:00,542 --> 00:24:03,083
and I bought everything they had.

392
00:24:03,209 --> 00:24:06,501
So I had good stuff like the cannons and good lenses

393
00:24:06,501 --> 00:24:08,834
and everything else.

394
00:24:08,834 --> 00:24:11,250
Just to explain what we're going about here.

395
00:24:11,584 --> 00:24:14,999
So the problem was that the best camera to shoot

396
00:24:14,999 --> 00:24:18,584
with is the Cannon 5D, Mark 2.

397
00:24:18,709 --> 00:24:20,999
I don't mean in life, I don't play that fuckin' game,

398
00:24:20,999 --> 00:24:22,999
but it's the camera I found would produce

399
00:24:22,999 --> 00:24:26,584
really good footage under certain circumstances.

400
00:24:26,792 --> 00:24:29,667
But the body is $4000 and the lenses are thousands,

401
00:24:29,667 --> 00:24:32,876
and I had one, because I got them for my movie,

402
00:24:32,876 --> 00:24:36,959
but I knew we were going to have three crews and I can't give

403
00:24:36,959 --> 00:24:40,709
away three Cannon 5Ds, and we settled on a Vixia, which I

404
00:24:40,709 --> 00:24:43,375
will show you in a moment.

405
00:24:45,834 --> 00:24:49,459
Rachel had a Cannon 5D, I had a Cannon 5D,

406
00:24:49,459 --> 00:24:54,209
and we had three Vixias, and then we also this was one

407
00:24:54,209 --> 00:24:58,375
of our ideas, was let's get little Play Sports,

408
00:24:58,375 --> 00:25:03,667
and what you see there in the center there is an orange one

409
00:25:03,667 --> 00:25:08,501
and two black ones, let's get Play Sports and give them

410
00:25:08,501 --> 00:25:11,751
to people at the Con and get footage

411
00:25:11,751 --> 00:25:16,918
and see what comes of that with the hope that we would get

412
00:25:16,918 --> 00:25:21,292
something utterly disgusting, something horrifying,

413
00:25:21,292 --> 00:25:25,709
where this would be a moment where you were like,

414
00:25:25,709 --> 00:25:32,083
is it more of a crime that it can be seen and not just vaguely remembered

415
00:25:32,083 --> 00:25:34,459
and drank away?

416
00:25:34,959 --> 00:25:37,334
(Laughter.) Is it terrible?

417
00:25:38,584 --> 00:25:41,417
And we figured they would come back and

418
00:25:41,417 --> 00:25:45,999
they would have been destroyed or someone would never come back

419
00:25:45,999 --> 00:25:50,417
with them or whatever but we got 11 of them just in case and

420
00:25:50,417 --> 00:25:54,999
they were cheap, we got them on special, they were under $100,

421
00:25:54,999 --> 00:25:59,999
water proof, shoot in high def, they can take shock and dust they're

422
00:25:59,999 --> 00:26:04,375
tough little bastards, so that was our secret sauce wild card

423
00:26:04,375 --> 00:26:08,542
as opposed to the documentary crew runs in.

424
00:26:08,542 --> 00:26:13,083
Obviously we would respect people and we wanted shots that were

425
00:26:13,083 --> 00:26:18,125
evocative, but we didn't want to loose crew if somebody went

426
00:26:18,125 --> 00:26:24,083
on a road trip    RACHEL LOVINGER: And this let us be places we weren't

427
00:26:24,083 --> 00:26:29,167
going to be, we gave them to some Goons and some people that

428
00:26:29,167 --> 00:26:32,209
were competing in the scavenger hunt

429
00:26:32,209 --> 00:26:37,876
and other contests where we couldn't be with them all the time and

430
00:26:37,876 --> 00:26:40,375
to some old timers.

431
00:26:40,375 --> 00:26:44,125
JASON SCOTT: So we ended up with a bunch of these cameras

432
00:26:44,125 --> 00:26:49,292
and other pieces and all digital, no analog, no videotape in here

433
00:26:49,292 --> 00:26:53,626
and we have zoom H4N recorders, which are my favorite,

434
00:26:53,626 --> 00:26:58,999
they're little guys, tough as well and you can do recording with them

435
00:26:58,999 --> 00:27:03,709
in all circumstances and they go right to MP3.

436
00:27:05,167 --> 00:27:06,999
Let's look at the next one.

437
00:27:07,501 --> 00:27:10,999
Here is the set up that we ended up going for or a variation of it.

438
00:27:11,292 --> 00:27:15,959
What this is me at another convention, a comic book grouping

439
00:27:15,959 --> 00:27:19,083
in New York City to test this.

440
00:27:19,083 --> 00:27:21,999
I ran around with it filming and we have

441
00:27:21,999 --> 00:27:26,999
a mono pod that film high definition and here I have

442
00:27:26,999 --> 00:27:33,999
an extended microphone and I'm storing the item in my pocket.

443
00:27:33,999 --> 00:27:36,501
We ended up getting ready of and slimming down and getting rid

444
00:27:36,501 --> 00:27:39,626
of the external microphone and using the internal microphone

445
00:27:39,626 --> 00:27:42,834
and having our guys put the microphone right here and try not

446
00:27:42,834 --> 00:27:46,834
to get in the shot and that actually worked out very well.

447
00:27:46,834 --> 00:27:51,918
So what you see there is a set up that is infinitely portable, it is really fast,

448
00:27:51,918 --> 00:27:55,876
to set up, can get anywhere, takes really good shots,

449
00:27:55,876 --> 00:28:01,792
and can deal with the action in just a really, really intense way.

450
00:28:01,792 --> 00:28:04,584
So it turned out to be a nice combination.

451
00:28:04,584 --> 00:28:06,918
We had three of these going at any given time.

452
00:28:06,999 --> 00:28:08,999
Is there another one?

453
00:28:08,999 --> 00:28:10,083
RACHEL LOVINGER: No.

454
00:28:10,083 --> 00:28:11,125
JASON SCOTT: Okay.

455
00:28:11,334 --> 00:28:15,792
So with that we kind of said, okay, well or I should say Rachel said,

456
00:28:15,792 --> 00:28:19,959
we should have a presence online, let's get people excited,

457
00:28:19,959 --> 00:28:24,999
isn't that what you do with a campaign, let's say here is what's going on,

458
00:28:24,999 --> 00:28:29,918
Facebook group, a Twitter stream, let's let people know what's going

459
00:28:29,918 --> 00:28:33,417
on and build a presence for the DEF CON documentary

460
00:28:33,417 --> 00:28:36,959
in anticipation and there is an interesting thing

461
00:28:36,959 --> 00:28:39,959
about that which is that nobody gives a sit

462
00:28:39,959 --> 00:28:43,709
about DEF CON until like a month before.

463
00:28:44,250 --> 00:28:47,999
(Chuckles.) A few insiders do but on the general nobody

464
00:28:47,999 --> 00:28:51,918
is like" better check the Twitter stream "they don't start

465
00:28:51,918 --> 00:28:56,125
getting excited until right before and we had conflict internally

466
00:28:56,125 --> 00:29:00,999
about this because she was like, we should treat this well and I'm like"

467
00:29:00,999 --> 00:29:04,999
but nobody is giving a shit and we're not getting responses

468
00:29:04,999 --> 00:29:08,751
and I would rather focus on this "so we had conflict and

469
00:29:08,751 --> 00:29:12,584
for anybody who is doing anything like this again, DEF CON

470
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:17,542
is something that people put a lot of energy in but they put energy either

471
00:29:17,542 --> 00:29:20,999
on their projects or they put energy toward learning

472
00:29:20,999 --> 00:29:23,876
about it in anticipation, like a few weeks

473
00:29:23,876 --> 00:29:27,999
before to get more info so it's better to back load your stuff

474
00:29:27,999 --> 00:29:31,667
and have it ready to go and start dropping hints a week

475
00:29:31,667 --> 00:29:34,083
or two or three before.

476
00:29:34,667 --> 00:29:38,918
Work on it, do your projects but they don't really start paying

477
00:29:38,918 --> 00:29:43,292
attention to day by day, reloading until just before.

478
00:29:43,292 --> 00:29:44,709
That was a hard lesson.

479
00:29:44,709 --> 00:29:47,083
We wasted a little bit of energy on that.

480
00:29:47,584 --> 00:29:51,999
RACHEL LOVINGER: All right, then we get to production.

481
00:29:51,999 --> 00:29:54,375
JASON SCOTT: I think I do production, too.

482
00:29:54,375 --> 00:29:55,999
RACHEL LOVINGER: Hear you go.

483
00:29:55,999 --> 00:29:57,209
JASON SCOTT: How do you capture the spirit of DEF CON past and present,

484
00:29:57,209 --> 00:29:58,959
says the slide!

485
00:30:00,042 --> 00:30:03,209
(Chuckles.) My concern was that.

486
00:30:05,834 --> 00:30:08,792
Like I said, first of all, no G4 crap!

487
00:30:08,999 --> 00:30:12,999
Second of all I wasn't overly interested in doing what I was going

488
00:30:12,999 --> 00:30:16,876
to call" Sparky goes to DEF CON story "where I find a kid,

489
00:30:16,876 --> 00:30:19,626
he goes to DEF CON for the first time I go

490
00:30:19,626 --> 00:30:23,751
to his house I fine out his mom and dad are still married and

491
00:30:23,751 --> 00:30:26,999
he likes computers and he's going to DEF CON and

492
00:30:26,999 --> 00:30:30,542
he will be found dead with the bubbles floating on top

493
00:30:30,542 --> 00:30:32,375
the next day.

494
00:30:34,959 --> 00:30:39,334
(Chuckles.) I wasn't interested in that narrative, it's valid to do

495
00:30:39,334 --> 00:30:44,042
a story that way but I didn't think I wanted to do that.

496
00:30:44,042 --> 00:30:45,834
I wasn't comfortable with that.

497
00:30:45,834 --> 00:30:47,999
What I wanted to do was have authoritative voices

498
00:30:47,999 --> 00:30:51,999
in a mosaic discussing what DEF CON means to them and

499
00:30:51,999 --> 00:30:56,667
the best we can illustrate that in the material over the course

500
00:30:56,667 --> 00:31:00,751
of the next over the course of the movie.

501
00:31:01,083 --> 00:31:05,999
There was another mystery factor and I know the joke which was" what

502
00:31:05,999 --> 00:31:07,999
if DEF CON gets cancelled?

503
00:31:07,999 --> 00:31:11,876
"And it could be there are ways to be cancelled

504
00:31:11,876 --> 00:31:15,209
without being cancelled, right?

505
00:31:15,999 --> 00:31:18,626
Hotel gets smoke bombed, there is a problem,

506
00:31:18,626 --> 00:31:22,334
because of something there is nobody able to attend the talked

507
00:31:22,334 --> 00:31:25,250
in the same way, they run into a security issue,

508
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:29,083
anything there might not be a DEF CON to film!

509
00:31:30,459 --> 00:31:33,542
That would be an interesting story right?

510
00:31:33,792 --> 00:31:40,417
DEF CON cancelled and just credits, organ music, fades,

511
00:31:40,417 --> 00:31:46,250
it's 17 minute movie, da da da da da da!

512
00:31:46,250 --> 00:31:47,250
I was worried.

513
00:31:47,250 --> 00:31:49,751
So I front loaded with as many interviews

514
00:31:49,751 --> 00:31:54,751
as I could handle especially with staff that I thought would be balls

515
00:31:54,751 --> 00:31:57,834
to the wall so what you're seeing is a set

516
00:31:57,834 --> 00:32:01,999
up at Hope and hope really appreciated that I was filming

517
00:32:01,999 --> 00:32:04,999
a DEF CON documentary there.

518
00:32:08,918 --> 00:32:12,751
I was able to do one thing, we were able to fly

519
00:32:12,751 --> 00:32:18,083
in Dead Addict because he lives in Toronto but I didn't want to go

520
00:32:18,083 --> 00:32:24,459
to Toronto to film him so I brought him to New York so for of first time one

521
00:32:24,459 --> 00:32:29,083
of 4 people who has been to DEF CON every time got to be

522
00:32:29,083 --> 00:32:32,999
to Hope and we're filming in a hotel room I got

523
00:32:32,999 --> 00:32:38,834
for him so it was reuse and I filmed with Dual Core at hope and others

524
00:32:38,834 --> 00:32:41,626
and this is my set up.

525
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:45,083
You can see my Cannon, I use a boom mic and halogen lights

526
00:32:45,083 --> 00:32:49,834
and flood the room with light and bounce it off.

527
00:32:49,834 --> 00:32:52,083
This is a shitty hotel room; let's be clear.

528
00:32:52,125 --> 00:32:55,250
The hotel in Pennsylvania is one of the worst pieces of property

529
00:32:55,250 --> 00:32:58,709
in an urban area outside much a fire bombing or World War II

530
00:32:58,709 --> 00:33:01,876
but I was able to get mileage out of moving it    RACHEL

531
00:33:01,876 --> 00:33:06,083
LOVINGER: If you've sheen" The Shining "it feels like that.

532
00:33:06,417 --> 00:33:15,501
JASON SCOTT:" Shining plus ass rape!

533
00:33:15,501 --> 00:33:16,834
"

534
00:33:16,834 --> 00:33:19,999
So here is me filming Jeff, I'm aiming it at his desk, this

535
00:33:19,999 --> 00:33:22,999
is only one of two locations we could use,

536
00:33:22,999 --> 00:33:26,167
the other was truly unusable, this had an echo,

537
00:33:26,167 --> 00:33:29,083
but I filmed him randomly.

538
00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:35,083
I went to Seattle, I went to Los Angeles, I went to Colorado, Denver area,

539
00:33:35,083 --> 00:33:40,999
and I went to a couple of houses in California and a couple of houses

540
00:33:40,999 --> 00:33:45,292
on the east coast and Washington, D.C.

541
00:33:45,876 --> 00:33:48,751
basically did about 50 interviews with people that made it

542
00:33:48,751 --> 00:33:53,667
into the movie in some cases, some cases didn't get into the movie.

543
00:34:00,999 --> 00:34:05,626
Hacker spaces like Black Lodge in Seattle, they opened

544
00:34:05,626 --> 00:34:10,834
up their spaces to me and one by one I would interview them

545
00:34:10,834 --> 00:34:15,918
and try my best to make them all interesting locations and

546
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:19,375
by the time I was done, before minute one

547
00:34:19,375 --> 00:34:24,584
of DEF CON started I had roughly, I want to say, between 30

548
00:34:24,584 --> 00:34:28,667
and forty hours of DEF CON footage.

549
00:34:28,751 --> 00:34:32,083
About DEF CON and senior staff explaining why DEF CON meant things

550
00:34:32,083 --> 00:34:35,667
to them, what it was about and everything.

551
00:34:35,667 --> 00:34:38,209
So I knew I wouldn't have to track those people down.

552
00:34:38,667 --> 00:34:41,417
There were people who used to be part

553
00:34:41,417 --> 00:34:47,083
of DEF CON and are never going back again or will rarely go back

554
00:34:47,083 --> 00:34:52,751
like Deaf Vegetable and Swamp Rat, so it took me 60 days to fly

555
00:34:52,751 --> 00:34:58,459
around and do these interviews so I knew I was preloaded so if it

556
00:34:58,459 --> 00:35:03,751
all blue up I could then say" ironically it never happened!

557
00:35:03,751 --> 00:35:07,959
"But the thing is the first BBS documentary has

558
00:35:07,959 --> 00:35:11,999
a lot of talking heads and they're weaved well

559
00:35:11,999 --> 00:35:17,209
and I worked hard on it and the same thing with GIT Lamp and

560
00:35:17,209 --> 00:35:21,083
a lot of illustrations of games.

561
00:35:21,375 --> 00:35:26,999
I knew I wanted it to be kinetic, that there was motion, DEF CON

562
00:35:26,999 --> 00:35:31,334
is a thing of motion and activity and throngs

563
00:35:31,334 --> 00:35:34,834
and people moving around.

564
00:35:34,959 --> 00:35:39,584
So I resolved that even though I had 30 or forty hours of people sitting

565
00:35:39,584 --> 00:35:44,375
and telling you" DEF CON is awesome, I couldn't see by Saturday, it

566
00:35:44,375 --> 00:35:48,959
is fantastic "I wanted that you would see somebody blind drunk

567
00:35:48,959 --> 00:35:53,209
on Saturday or see that people were working hard or soldering

568
00:35:53,209 --> 00:35:58,999
and that was on my list to make sure it would have that feeling.

569
00:36:01,999 --> 00:36:02,999
Yep.

570
00:36:02,999 --> 00:36:06,751
RACHEL LOVINGER: That was all in the lead up time to DEF CON

571
00:36:06,751 --> 00:36:12,459
and finally last July we assembled our crew at DEF CON, there we are.

572
00:36:12,999 --> 00:36:15,918
JASON SCOTT: I love that shot.

573
00:36:15,918 --> 00:36:17,999
RACHEL LOVINGER: With fearless leader.

574
00:36:17,999 --> 00:36:24,751
JASON SCOTT: Yep and the Lost Boys and we are an Army.

575
00:36:25,083 --> 00:36:29,834
I love this shot so it's everywhere because it captures it.

576
00:36:29,999 --> 00:36:32,375
Oh yeah, what's up with the fuckin' segue, Jason!

577
00:36:33,459 --> 00:36:38,999
I've been known for having a segue in previous years because I like segues,

578
00:36:38,999 --> 00:36:42,209
and I discovered or realized that we were going

579
00:36:42,209 --> 00:36:45,626
to have situations where we would be over here

580
00:36:45,626 --> 00:36:50,999
in track 3 and something would happen in Penn and Teller and I would have

581
00:36:50,999 --> 00:36:54,417
to go there so I'm like, I'm going to get a Segue

582
00:36:54,417 --> 00:36:58,209
because we didn't know if we were going to get radios

583
00:36:58,209 --> 00:37:01,167
or communication so the Segue became the"

584
00:37:01,167 --> 00:37:03,626
catchall "solution!

585
00:37:03,918 --> 00:37:07,250
RACHEL LOVINGER: Okay.

586
00:37:07,542 --> 00:37:09,999
So we got here, we checked our equipment,

587
00:37:09,999 --> 00:37:13,918
had a couple of hotel rooms, one of them became our HQ,

588
00:37:13,918 --> 00:37:19,999
production HQ and we made sure everything was there, it was all working.

589
00:37:21,125 --> 00:37:25,083
Before the conference started we took our crew around, we did a walk

590
00:37:25,083 --> 00:37:28,167
through of the space to show them where everything was

591
00:37:28,167 --> 00:37:31,999
going to be and we had them take the equipment with them and kind

592
00:37:31,999 --> 00:37:34,999
of test it out and get comfortable with it and be able

593
00:37:34,999 --> 00:37:38,459
to ask some questions and stuff like that.

594
00:37:38,459 --> 00:37:42,751
So we did a walk through of this area, I think that was helpful.

595
00:37:42,751 --> 00:37:44,999
We did a boot camp, but mostly it was just, again,

596
00:37:44,999 --> 00:37:48,125
to make sure they were going to be safe and comfortable

597
00:37:48,125 --> 00:37:52,999
and bring the footage back to us each day and that sort of thing.

598
00:37:54,334 --> 00:37:58,999
The conference lent us a bunch of things, walkie talkies which ended

599
00:37:58,999 --> 00:38:01,501
up being you don't want to keep them

600
00:38:01,501 --> 00:38:05,167
on while you're filming because you don't want someone

601
00:38:05,167 --> 00:38:09,542
like    JASON SCOTT: Do we know where room 4 is?

602
00:38:09,542 --> 00:38:12,083
RACHEL LOVINGER: That can screw up the footage, so these ended

603
00:38:12,083 --> 00:38:14,292
up being of limited use.

604
00:38:16,083 --> 00:38:18,709
JASON SCOTT: I seem to have a vague memory

605
00:38:18,709 --> 00:38:22,501
of us doing something enjoyable with those radios.

606
00:38:23,834 --> 00:38:27,999
RACHEL LOVINGER: We used them to" prank "each other.

607
00:38:27,999 --> 00:38:29,375
JASON SCOTT: And we would fuck with each other," does anyone need

608
00:38:29,375 --> 00:38:31,083
to know where Kyle is?

609
00:38:31,709 --> 00:38:35,083
Kyle here, you don't need to find me ".

610
00:38:35,709 --> 00:38:40,083
RACHEL LOVINGER: And the hotel rooms.

611
00:38:40,083 --> 00:38:41,584
JASON SCOTT: The hotel rooms came from DEF CON themselves

612
00:38:41,584 --> 00:38:43,876
and that was not in the budget.

613
00:38:44,209 --> 00:38:52,417
We had a couple I think we had three to put our staff in and have this thing.

614
00:38:52,709 --> 00:38:55,584
RACHEL LOVINGER: So we bought supplies, got a lot

615
00:38:55,584 --> 00:38:59,292
of water and caffeine and food and Post it Notes and this

616
00:38:59,292 --> 00:39:02,999
is how I learned if you go to two different drug stories

617
00:39:02,999 --> 00:39:07,250
in Las Vegas and spend $100 in each one sometimes your bank turns

618
00:39:07,250 --> 00:39:10,626
off your credit card for no reason!

619
00:39:10,876 --> 00:39:12,751
(Laughter.) That was awkward!

620
00:39:13,083 --> 00:39:16,501
We had our production meeting in HQ every day,

621
00:39:16,501 --> 00:39:20,417
our room and we had our list of things that were going

622
00:39:20,417 --> 00:39:24,250
on and we had assembled our crew into two three pairs

623
00:39:24,250 --> 00:39:29,375
of two people so we would have one person and we actually figured this

624
00:39:29,375 --> 00:39:33,709
out during the boot camp, who liked doing using the camera,

625
00:39:33,709 --> 00:39:38,209
who liked doing audio, we figured out who was a morning person,

626
00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:42,667
who was a night person and we paired them up, like we paired

627
00:39:42,667 --> 00:39:46,209
up morning people together and we had three groups

628
00:39:46,209 --> 00:39:49,125
of one camera man and one audio recorder

629
00:39:49,125 --> 00:39:52,334
and we    JASON SCOTT: Colors!

630
00:39:52,334 --> 00:39:55,083
RACHEL LOVINGER: We Nick named them team red, green, blue,

631
00:39:55,083 --> 00:39:59,167
and when we knew what things needed to be filmed each day we would say"

632
00:39:59,167 --> 00:40:02,083
is this something you're going to be interested in?

633
00:40:02,083 --> 00:40:06,375
"So we would go through the things, here is what's happening tomorrow who

634
00:40:06,375 --> 00:40:08,417
want to film this?

635
00:40:08,417 --> 00:40:12,083
And we would makeup a shot list for each day, so they would know

636
00:40:12,083 --> 00:40:16,334
at 10:00 this is happening and what's happening and then we had

637
00:40:16,334 --> 00:40:19,792
a bunch of things that were like, at some point go

638
00:40:19,792 --> 00:40:24,542
by the hardware hacking village so there were things that were happening

639
00:40:24,542 --> 00:40:28,751
and things that were happening all day but they had their list

640
00:40:28,751 --> 00:40:32,999
and we had the master list on the wall which we had every event

641
00:40:32,999 --> 00:40:35,667
that was going on up there and by the end

642
00:40:35,667 --> 00:40:39,459
of the day we would check off the ones that we had gotten

643
00:40:39,459 --> 00:40:42,792
coverage of and if we had ones that hadn't gotten

644
00:40:42,792 --> 00:40:47,000
covered but they were continuing the next day we would move those

645
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,501
over to the next day.

646
00:40:49,501 --> 00:40:53,999
JASON SCOTT: We had team red, we renamed them" team breaking

647
00:40:53,999 --> 00:40:58,167
balds, "because it was two bald guys and we paired

648
00:40:58,167 --> 00:41:03,999
up our least experienced member with our most experienced member so

649
00:41:03,999 --> 00:41:08,876
it was Alex who had not been to Vegas or been to DEF CON

650
00:41:08,876 --> 00:41:13,167
or Donnie shooting up with Eddie who had all of that

651
00:41:13,167 --> 00:41:18,999
with the judged idea that it would be a reasonably talented person

652
00:41:18,999 --> 00:41:23,125
and (Chuckles.) Like everything else, Eddie worked

653
00:41:23,125 --> 00:41:28,959
with Alex and it went pretty well and the other teams worked well,

654
00:41:28,959 --> 00:41:32,999
team breaking bald turned out to be a real gift

655
00:41:32,999 --> 00:41:38,542
because these guys were getting up at 8 and they were going to bed

656
00:41:38,542 --> 00:41:42,584
at 2 or 3 over and over and Steve on that team,

657
00:41:42,584 --> 00:41:49,292
the camera guy would film endless establishing shots of everything.

658
00:41:49,292 --> 00:41:52,999
So if you picked up the groceries, he would film the bag, you grabbing

659
00:41:52,999 --> 00:41:56,334
the groceries, you holding the groceries, the groceries,

660
00:41:56,334 --> 00:42:01,083
the groceries in the fridge, the fridge, the house the fridge is in, the sun,

661
00:42:01,083 --> 00:42:04,918
and the town and the factory that the fridge was manufactured

662
00:42:04,918 --> 00:42:08,083
in (Chuckles.) And that was a gift to me down the line

663
00:42:08,083 --> 00:42:12,751
because I would have someone talk in the editing room and I would be like,

664
00:42:12,751 --> 00:42:15,751
do I have a shot of course I have a shot of that,

665
00:42:15,751 --> 00:42:19,125
because there were shots of rooms, people, each team took

666
00:42:19,125 --> 00:42:23,209
on a character of what they wanted to do and organically that part

667
00:42:23,209 --> 00:42:26,417
of organic but thanks to Rachel's planning there was

668
00:42:26,417 --> 00:42:29,083
a lot that was not organic.

669
00:42:29,334 --> 00:42:33,876
I'm a real improvisor, and I don't come in with a lot

670
00:42:33,876 --> 00:42:39,792
of questions as opposed to, it was like, what is everyone doing, it was

671
00:42:39,792 --> 00:42:44,999
like we knew, and you should go out and come back!

672
00:42:46,167 --> 00:42:50,999
So people see this movie I'm factorially pulling this

673
00:42:50,999 --> 00:42:56,999
out but when people see this stuff it's because she did this matrixes

674
00:42:56,999 --> 00:43:01,626
of all these items of stuff so we were always aware

675
00:43:01,626 --> 00:43:07,459
of what we needed, and that's the real secret hard work that's not

676
00:43:07,459 --> 00:43:10,375
obvious on the screen.

677
00:43:10,459 --> 00:43:12,999
It's not just, oh, they filmed until they made a movie,

678
00:43:12,999 --> 00:43:15,459
that's what was really there.

679
00:43:15,459 --> 00:43:19,417
So unfortunately there is no secret" get movie quick scheme!

680
00:43:19,417 --> 00:43:23,083
"   RACHEL LOVINGER: So another part of our HQ,

681
00:43:23,083 --> 00:43:27,999
this was our information hub and every time the guys dropped

682
00:43:27,999 --> 00:43:32,999
off their memory cards we copied them on to multiple hard drives

683
00:43:32,999 --> 00:43:38,999
to make sure we had many copies of it and nothing would get lost.

684
00:43:38,999 --> 00:43:43,292
JASON SCOTT: We had three hard drives every piece of footage went

685
00:43:43,292 --> 00:43:47,999
on three hard drives and then when we got it home we put them

686
00:43:47,999 --> 00:43:51,999
in six hard drives in three locations.

687
00:43:51,999 --> 00:43:54,417
To verify that we would never lose the footage due

688
00:43:54,417 --> 00:43:57,083
to a hard drive going south.

689
00:43:57,626 --> 00:44:02,417
Just to understand how much space these things have, the cameras,

690
00:44:02,417 --> 00:44:06,083
the Vixia's had two, 32 gig cards in them and

691
00:44:06,083 --> 00:44:10,083
they could record 25 hours of high def video and

692
00:44:10,083 --> 00:44:15,167
the audio could do 36 hours of full audio before being swamped

693
00:44:15,167 --> 00:44:21,125
out so even though we did that every day we didn't have situations where

694
00:44:21,125 --> 00:44:25,375
people were like" I'm out of film "so that part was

695
00:44:25,375 --> 00:44:30,999
the overengineered but it turned out to be really good.

696
00:44:32,459 --> 00:44:35,792
RACHEL LOVINGER: Then we started filming.

697
00:44:35,999 --> 00:44:38,999
JASON SCOTT: You know, the gang was set

698
00:44:38,999 --> 00:44:43,501
out on this really strange journey, right?

699
00:44:43,501 --> 00:44:48,083
These guys were put into this thing, for them they had never been

700
00:44:48,083 --> 00:44:52,542
to Vegas before or to DEF CON before and it is strange

701
00:44:52,542 --> 00:44:57,876
to experience DEF CON in" God mode "where you have carte blanche

702
00:44:57,876 --> 00:45:00,626
to walk into anything.

703
00:45:03,751 --> 00:45:05,501
Especially for others.

704
00:45:07,999 --> 00:45:12,167
Imagine you're walking into a room and people are talking and well,

705
00:45:12,167 --> 00:45:14,999
I think I will go on stage and this needs me

706
00:45:14,999 --> 00:45:19,292
and I'm going to film the back of their head because I feel like it

707
00:45:19,292 --> 00:45:23,083
and that guy he's interesting, he's leaving I'll follow him

708
00:45:23,083 --> 00:45:27,542
like a until he goes into the hallway and this thing?

709
00:45:27,999 --> 00:45:33,167
The Goon security center let's talk to them, what the hell?

710
00:45:33,542 --> 00:45:35,375
So that was like a massive emotional thing

711
00:45:35,375 --> 00:45:39,999
for me but for the others it was like, okay, I guess I'm going to film this part!

712
00:45:41,292 --> 00:45:44,626
They were able to film inside and outside, here

713
00:45:44,626 --> 00:45:47,999
is an example of unused footage we filmed Scotland

714
00:45:47,999 --> 00:45:51,209
at the toxic BBQ but you could see how the set

715
00:45:51,209 --> 00:45:55,459
up might be, they're listen to go what's going on and talking

716
00:45:55,459 --> 00:45:59,167
to Scotland about the toxic BBQ and these set ups were

717
00:45:59,167 --> 00:46:01,375
where everywhere.

718
00:46:05,083 --> 00:46:07,876
I started filming from the Segue.

719
00:46:08,167 --> 00:46:11,876
What this does was afforded me" crane "shots to give me

720
00:46:11,876 --> 00:46:15,501
the kinetic energy that I wanted in the shot and the film

721
00:46:15,501 --> 00:46:17,918
is loaded with these.

722
00:46:17,918 --> 00:46:21,999
These are post process the stabilized crane shots, shot

723
00:46:21,999 --> 00:46:25,959
all over and I'm wearing a hat because I tried

724
00:46:25,959 --> 00:46:30,999
to make myself more obvious, like I see a weird orange vest

725
00:46:30,999 --> 00:46:36,459
and a cowboy hat, oh, it's the weird camera guy and looking back

726
00:46:36,459 --> 00:46:39,918
I should have had a steady camera thing

727
00:46:39,918 --> 00:46:42,667
but I didn't do that.

728
00:46:42,667 --> 00:46:45,626
I would be driving along and go like this, go around people

729
00:46:45,626 --> 00:46:50,292
and keep going and that Segue give me enormous ability.

730
00:46:50,292 --> 00:46:54,459
There is a scene where it goes around a speaker party on the roof

731
00:46:54,459 --> 00:46:58,999
in the movie and you see me zooming through people like I'm

732
00:46:58,999 --> 00:47:03,459
on weird rails like right by people's heads and I only ran

733
00:47:03,459 --> 00:47:06,834
over one person the whole Con!

734
00:47:06,834 --> 00:47:11,667
(Laughter.) Which was really amazing, I was surprised it was only once

735
00:47:11,667 --> 00:47:15,792
and it was his fault because he had I was sitting

736
00:47:15,792 --> 00:47:21,999
on the front row with his feet way, way, way out and it was dark and I flew

737
00:47:21,999 --> 00:47:27,999
over and he yelled and I gave him a red card and kept going!

738
00:47:33,999 --> 00:47:35,667
(Laughter.)" Don't touch my Segue!

739
00:47:35,667 --> 00:47:37,999
"Beside accident a transport mechanism it turned

740
00:47:37,999 --> 00:47:40,083
out to be a good flinching mechanism so it added

741
00:47:40,083 --> 00:47:41,751
to the film.

742
00:47:41,751 --> 00:47:45,667
I guess I will mention here I believe in tone poems where you look

743
00:47:45,667 --> 00:47:51,083
at pieces of work and say, why do I feel this when I look at it?

744
00:47:51,334 --> 00:47:53,083
How do I create this?

745
00:47:53,626 --> 00:47:55,792
How do I get that feel?

746
00:47:55,792 --> 00:48:01,083
And for me, believe it or not, a lot of the tone poem for the movie

747
00:48:01,083 --> 00:48:06,459
for me comes from action scenes in Sherlock Holmes 2," Game

748
00:48:06,459 --> 00:48:11,999
of Shadows "and if you watch the fight scene at the end, a lot

749
00:48:11,999 --> 00:48:18,125
of the kinetic sense of that movie I wanted this to have.

750
00:48:18,334 --> 00:48:21,584
So I use that had as a template, a" rough "feeling

751
00:48:21,584 --> 00:48:25,292
of what would it feel like to go through DEF CON so

752
00:48:25,292 --> 00:48:27,999
the Segue helped a lot.

753
00:48:29,209 --> 00:48:33,584
Anyway, so the crew went everywhere!

754
00:48:33,792 --> 00:48:36,999
They weren't afraid to go everywhere!

755
00:48:36,999 --> 00:48:40,501
In a lot of different shots you will see them, because one crew

756
00:48:40,501 --> 00:48:43,959
will catch another by mistake because they're moving

757
00:48:43,959 --> 00:48:48,709
around so much so you can see here all these different cases where they're

758
00:48:48,709 --> 00:48:52,083
filming and this is in many cases our these are screen

759
00:48:52,083 --> 00:48:54,667
shots from other team members catching

760
00:48:54,667 --> 00:48:57,626
other team members on the way.

761
00:48:57,999 --> 00:49:02,626
I watched great movement, and I make a joke about Kyle

762
00:49:02,626 --> 00:49:07,959
because in the beginning Kyle would say" would it be possible

763
00:49:07,959 --> 00:49:12,999
to film you and I would like to talk to you "and by Saturday

764
00:49:12,999 --> 00:49:14,959
he was like" Yo, sup?

765
00:49:14,959 --> 00:49:20,083
"And he's like, yeah, I'm working on this thing and they were

766
00:49:20,083 --> 00:49:24,834
an unstoppable force, like a news program on steroids,

767
00:49:24,834 --> 00:49:30,083
slamming through this place to get info and sometimes miracles

768
00:49:30,083 --> 00:49:35,918
of stepping in and getting a perfect shot of this event happening,

769
00:49:35,918 --> 00:49:39,167
perfectly framed, beautiful!

770
00:49:39,667 --> 00:49:43,834
RACHEL LOVINGER: And Jason mentioned we had some team that was

771
00:49:43,834 --> 00:49:46,250
the morning and some were in the evening

772
00:49:46,250 --> 00:49:50,292
but really everybody was shooting like we were working from 8:00

773
00:49:50,292 --> 00:49:54,667
in the morning until sometimes 2 in the morning and then we would go

774
00:49:54,667 --> 00:49:58,667
back to the room and have our, you know, debrief and production

775
00:49:58,667 --> 00:50:01,626
and planning for the next day so I think we got

776
00:50:01,626 --> 00:50:05,999
roughly, like, three or four hours of sleep a night.

777
00:50:05,999 --> 00:50:08,375
JASON SCOTT: Right and one of the things I mean,

778
00:50:08,375 --> 00:50:12,250
I was very strong about treating the crew with much respect

779
00:50:12,250 --> 00:50:15,292
as possible so, again, we paid for the flights

780
00:50:15,292 --> 00:50:19,501
in so nobody was putting any money in and I insisted that we go

781
00:50:19,501 --> 00:50:23,459
on a nice dinner the night before DEF CON started on we went

782
00:50:23,459 --> 00:50:27,667
to the Italian place to talk more but to let them have whatever

783
00:50:27,667 --> 00:50:31,125
they wanted on the menu because I knew they were going

784
00:50:31,125 --> 00:50:34,042
to get terrible he sleep and terrible teeth,

785
00:50:34,042 --> 00:50:39,999
and I wanted them to have a memory of oh yeah, Vegas was kinda fun once!

786
00:50:40,417 --> 00:50:42,501
While they're stuck on the ground trying

787
00:50:42,501 --> 00:50:45,626
to get this one shot of somebody talking.

788
00:50:45,626 --> 00:50:48,999
I was happy once, I will be happy again!

789
00:50:50,417 --> 00:50:54,417
(Laughter.) So, you know, because, again, this is the first time I have people

790
00:50:54,417 --> 00:50:58,000
working for me in this capacity and I can do whatever I want to myself,

791
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,999
you know, I used to do I had film things where I would go

792
00:51:00,999 --> 00:51:04,667
1,000 miles in four days and that's fine, it's one guy getting punched

793
00:51:04,667 --> 00:51:06,999
in the face from that but I am punching people

794
00:51:06,999 --> 00:51:10,417
in the face doing this and I wanted them to happen I respected them

795
00:51:10,417 --> 00:51:13,542
as people and they're not" for hire "machines that I can run

796
00:51:13,542 --> 00:51:17,667
into the ground and drop into the recycle bin when I'm done.

797
00:51:17,667 --> 00:51:20,209
RACHEL LOVINGER: They worked really hard.

798
00:51:20,209 --> 00:51:22,709
JASON SCOTT: Really hard.

799
00:51:23,292 --> 00:51:29,209
This is my lovely Alex falling asleep during an interview.

800
00:51:30,999 --> 00:51:33,709
It's adorable because if you listen to the footage they're like," do we

801
00:51:33,709 --> 00:51:34,999
wake him?

802
00:51:34,999 --> 00:51:36,417
No, just keep talkin'!

803
00:51:36,417 --> 00:51:42,999
"(Laughter.) This was Alex' first time in Las Vegas and Alex is 18 so

804
00:51:42,999 --> 00:51:49,999
he would finish a day at 2 in the morning and go back out again!

805
00:51:50,918 --> 00:51:54,918
So that's what you do when you're 18, 'cuz, why not?

806
00:51:54,918 --> 00:51:57,999
So it wreked him a few times but he got he definitely has work

807
00:51:57,999 --> 00:52:02,626
to show for it, beautiful work, it was rough on him, so this is one

808
00:52:02,626 --> 00:52:05,083
of my favorites of him.

809
00:52:05,792 --> 00:52:09,751
You just want to hug him!

810
00:52:09,751 --> 00:52:11,417
So we had a lot of really impressive response

811
00:52:11,417 --> 00:52:14,083
in places that we were going.

812
00:52:14,083 --> 00:52:18,918
It say from the DEF CON kids sequence and the crew would always make sure

813
00:52:18,918 --> 00:52:23,584
to get some really nicely framed interviews and do interviews

814
00:52:23,584 --> 00:52:26,709
like I had done to see them and fit them

815
00:52:26,709 --> 00:52:30,918
in and record them under circumstances) seamlessly fit

816
00:52:30,918 --> 00:52:35,083
them in and it wasn't just people talking here is a key

817
00:52:35,083 --> 00:52:39,626
to a door and sit them done and approach them straight up,

818
00:52:39,626 --> 00:52:41,999
why are you here?

819
00:52:44,083 --> 00:52:46,584
What does DEF CON mean to you?

820
00:52:46,626 --> 00:52:48,459
What's a funny story?

821
00:52:48,751 --> 00:52:51,167
Here these kids are explaining what work they're doing

822
00:52:51,167 --> 00:52:55,999
on the damage so there is a lot of stories that are not just mine.

823
00:52:55,999 --> 00:52:58,709
I would estimate 70 to 100 interviews that came back

824
00:52:58,709 --> 00:53:00,959
from the footage.

825
00:53:02,209 --> 00:53:05,999
Of course, we really liked shooting outside.

826
00:53:05,999 --> 00:53:09,999
I didn't think it needed to be and, you know, this was funny

827
00:53:09,999 --> 00:53:15,542
because this is one where Kyle got lost, I believe, right?

828
00:53:15,542 --> 00:53:16,792
RACHEL LOVINGER: No.

829
00:53:16,792 --> 00:53:18,959
It was    JASON SCOTT: Was it the other one?

830
00:53:18,959 --> 00:53:19,083
RACHEL LOVINGER: He didn't get lost going there,

831
00:53:19,083 --> 00:53:22,792
they arrived back here and he was trying to find the parking lot

832
00:53:22,792 --> 00:53:25,999
and going around Vegas was the problem.

833
00:53:25,999 --> 00:53:28,334
JASON SCOTT: He took the wrong turn and showed

834
00:53:28,334 --> 00:53:31,250
up an hour and a half later.

835
00:53:31,999 --> 00:53:35,209
With the haunted face of a Vietnam Vet!

836
00:53:35,834 --> 00:53:40,250
And I was prepared to let him have the rest of the day off.

837
00:53:40,792 --> 00:53:43,501
I was like, if he comes back, let him rest and we'll work

838
00:53:43,501 --> 00:53:45,542
with what we have.

839
00:53:45,542 --> 00:53:47,959
RACHEL LOVINGER: Then he turned around and went with us

840
00:53:47,959 --> 00:53:51,626
to the toxic BBQ    JASON SCOTT: Boom, grabbed it, went right out,

841
00:53:51,626 --> 00:53:55,375
after the initial haunting and pro, just took it!

842
00:53:55,459 --> 00:53:59,334
So we got wonderful shots Rachel and I wanted

843
00:53:59,334 --> 00:54:04,792
to capture these events that were on the peripheral of DEF CON

844
00:54:04,792 --> 00:54:09,999
and not just make it about, this beige room has these people

845
00:54:09,999 --> 00:54:15,334
and manufacture us never go to the BBQ or other events and this

846
00:54:15,334 --> 00:54:18,209
is what it looks like.

847
00:54:20,667 --> 00:54:22,999
This is why the movie starts with them

848
00:54:22,999 --> 00:54:27,999
because otherwise you would never know that this was happening.

849
00:54:30,083 --> 00:54:34,125
This is interesting because what you're seeing here

850
00:54:34,125 --> 00:54:38,209
is you're seeing General Alexander and Jeff walking

851
00:54:38,209 --> 00:54:41,083
but what you're seeing is Steve fish

852
00:54:41,083 --> 00:54:45,999
a new camera man learning how to do the" walk and talk "and

853
00:54:45,999 --> 00:54:51,626
the West Wing Adam Sorkin shot where he started walking backwards while

854
00:54:51,626 --> 00:54:55,834
these two guys talked about DEF CON and I had no use

855
00:54:55,834 --> 00:55:00,083
for this in the main movie but I made it the beginning

856
00:55:00,083 --> 00:55:04,417
of the preview because in it Jeff General says" what's

857
00:55:04,417 --> 00:55:05,876
up with the guys?

858
00:55:05,876 --> 00:55:10,959
"Do you have news crews and he says" no this is our people "and

859
00:55:10,959 --> 00:55:15,709
he begins to explain to the General, who would be number one

860
00:55:15,709 --> 00:55:19,751
of who would not give a shit about this the nature

861
00:55:19,751 --> 00:55:24,501
of the documentary and what the planning was and why they're

862
00:55:24,501 --> 00:55:26,375
doing that.

863
00:55:26,375 --> 00:55:30,626
So I made it the introduction of the preview so he was like" so,

864
00:55:30,626 --> 00:55:34,834
General Alexander, here is why we made the documentary

865
00:55:34,834 --> 00:55:38,959
and it's going to be an explanation "and it was crazy

866
00:55:38,959 --> 00:55:44,709
and the whole time Steve is walking backwards, filming people.

867
00:55:45,292 --> 00:55:51,999
It's a Stanley Kubrick one take master piece of not getting hit with anything!

868
00:55:52,083 --> 00:55:54,584
So it's crazy.

869
00:55:54,584 --> 00:55:58,250
RACHEL LOVINGER: I would say it helped that General Alexander's people

870
00:55:58,250 --> 00:56:00,292
were screaming" clear the hall!

871
00:56:00,292 --> 00:56:04,083
"   JASON SCOTT: That was working out well.

872
00:56:04,083 --> 00:56:06,999
RACHEL LOVINGER: Which he weren't doing that for us.

873
00:56:06,999 --> 00:56:08,999
JASON SCOTT: They should have been!

874
00:56:11,083 --> 00:56:15,209
(Laughter.) When you see the interviews that are done

875
00:56:15,209 --> 00:56:19,999
with the DEF CON logo behind them, what would happen is this

876
00:56:19,999 --> 00:56:25,083
is our hotel headquarters again, I moved the couch, stole a banner,

877
00:56:25,083 --> 00:56:29,999
hung it up behind it with light gear and a microphone stand and

878
00:56:29,999 --> 00:56:33,999
a chair and then swung it behind them and these are

879
00:56:33,999 --> 00:56:38,209
the more" pro "here is a thing behind me and I'm talking

880
00:56:38,209 --> 00:56:41,999
about this so that's why it's here.

881
00:56:42,999 --> 00:56:46,375
I conducted most of these on the Monday afterwards.

882
00:56:46,375 --> 00:56:48,999
These were people like Win and Dan Comin sky,

883
00:56:48,999 --> 00:56:51,999
who had been there and I hadn't had a chance

884
00:56:51,999 --> 00:56:56,334
to be there and Dan moved a night to be able to be interview so

885
00:56:56,334 --> 00:57:00,459
in the movie you will see these with the DEF CON logo, this

886
00:57:00,459 --> 00:57:03,667
is the set up that I would use.

887
00:57:03,999 --> 00:57:07,999
I would be interviewing a person on their no notes, no anything

888
00:57:07,999 --> 00:57:11,250
and then interviewing the person through a whole bunch

889
00:57:11,250 --> 00:57:14,834
of questions so a bunch of people sat this way and this

890
00:57:14,834 --> 00:57:18,083
is how we were able to get a few more" pro "interviews

891
00:57:18,083 --> 00:57:20,792
without too much trouble.

892
00:57:20,792 --> 00:57:23,501
I filmed over in one of the rooms here and if you listen

893
00:57:23,501 --> 00:57:28,626
on the sound track you can hear DEF CON floating in the background.

894
00:57:28,959 --> 00:57:30,626
This is just the sound, thrushing sound

895
00:57:30,626 --> 00:57:33,626
of people and things and I had to do enormous amounts

896
00:57:33,626 --> 00:57:37,626
of sound editing, which I'll talk about afterwards but this is the set

897
00:57:37,626 --> 00:57:41,667
up on the side    RACHEL LOVINGER: And Jason would say" where is Jason,

898
00:57:41,667 --> 00:57:44,999
I have Miss Kitty "she is ready to be interviewed right now

899
00:57:44,999 --> 00:57:47,792
and we would have to find you.

900
00:57:48,584 --> 00:57:55,167
JASON SCOTT: And I would walk up to people and say" hey, want

901
00:57:55,167 --> 00:57:57,083
to be interviewed?

902
00:57:57,083 --> 00:58:03,083
"And I would drag them off and it was random through that,

903
00:58:03,083 --> 00:58:07,918
that was how I was spending my day.

904
00:58:07,918 --> 00:58:11,999
Again, people were pulling out Play Sports that we had given them

905
00:58:11,999 --> 00:58:17,501
in all sorts of different locations so we were getting little tiny bonus

906
00:58:17,501 --> 00:58:22,792
with the exception of the scav hunt, produced about 20 hours of it,

907
00:58:22,792 --> 00:58:27,876
we had most people produce about 3 or 7 minutes, because they are

908
00:58:27,876 --> 00:58:32,999
in friggin 'DEF CON, they won't want to film it and they're fuckin'

909
00:58:32,999 --> 00:58:35,999
with things and then being done with it

910
00:58:35,999 --> 00:58:41,834
but there were people using these and they were very usable.

911
00:58:42,125 --> 00:58:44,834
So it turned out to be a good gage for what it was.

912
00:58:45,876 --> 00:58:50,834
There were a couple of times that we would film people

913
00:58:50,834 --> 00:58:56,542
and then they would sober up and find us and be like" you can't

914
00:58:56,542 --> 00:58:58,125
put that in there!

915
00:58:58,125 --> 00:59:03,626
"The most common thing was people would idolly say" and I'm

916
00:59:03,626 --> 00:59:09,125
in a documentary "and their boss's would say" and you're not!

917
00:59:09,125 --> 00:59:12,999
"Sometimes they were government employees,

918
00:59:12,999 --> 00:59:17,999
sometimes they got the fear of God in them and thought

919
00:59:17,999 --> 00:59:23,375
they said something intimidating and we would bodily delete

920
00:59:23,375 --> 00:59:29,999
the files because to be honest, like, 99.9% of the people had no problem

921
00:59:29,999 --> 00:59:33,083
with us filming, right?

922
00:59:33,083 --> 00:59:37,083
So you can't be like, well how dare you, we filmed it, it's ours now.

923
00:59:37,250 --> 00:59:39,959
I wanted to respect these people, I didn't want anyone

924
00:59:39,959 --> 00:59:42,999
to regret income our film offer at least minimize it and one way

925
00:59:42,999 --> 00:59:45,083
to do that was to respect people who were like,

926
00:59:45,083 --> 00:59:47,584
no I don't want to be in this or I'm not comfortable

927
00:59:47,584 --> 00:59:51,459
with it    RACHEL LOVINGER: And it only happened a few times.

928
00:59:51,459 --> 00:59:52,999
JASON SCOTT: Just a few times.

929
00:59:52,999 --> 00:59:56,209
I had a custom people who sat down and were interviewed

930
00:59:56,209 --> 01:00:01,375
and said can you not puppet in any part where I discussed this

931
01:00:01,375 --> 01:00:04,959
subject and I said okay, fine.

932
01:00:06,999 --> 01:00:09,459
I don't like playing that game of you said this was okay

933
01:00:09,459 --> 01:00:12,918
and now we own the footage and we're going to use it.

934
01:00:12,918 --> 01:00:16,083
You're making the wrong movie, you are making movies wrong, as far

935
01:00:16,083 --> 01:00:19,999
as I'm concerned in general if you're doing that, if you have

936
01:00:19,999 --> 01:00:24,167
to be that, you know don't act like you're exposing some underground

937
01:00:24,167 --> 01:00:26,999
or orchid ring or that you're Morley Safer

938
01:00:26,999 --> 01:00:31,542
and you just caught people" out "that's not how I operate.

939
01:00:32,876 --> 01:00:34,999
Minimally happened.

940
01:00:41,167 --> 01:00:43,083
Don't do this.

941
01:00:43,834 --> 01:00:50,999
I thought I was interviewing drunk people and they're funny!

942
01:00:51,542 --> 01:00:54,167
And I said and they were going to give me the post more item

943
01:00:54,167 --> 01:00:56,999
of how they won or lost Hacker Jeopardy.

944
01:01:01,125 --> 01:01:04,083
They're super sized drunk, right?

945
01:01:04,167 --> 01:01:07,876
And so I said, it would be funnier to do it in the bathroom!

946
01:01:10,999 --> 01:01:12,626
It got weird.

947
01:01:12,626 --> 01:01:15,792
(Laughter.) So what happened here is that basically and there is footage

948
01:01:15,792 --> 01:01:18,375
of this right because it's on.

949
01:01:18,375 --> 01:01:24,292
And I go" all right let's go into the bathroom and let's do this "so

950
01:01:24,292 --> 01:01:29,999
we go in and there is the casino host who had been using

951
01:01:29,999 --> 01:01:33,999
the bathroom, who came out and said" No!

952
01:01:33,999 --> 01:01:34,999
"

953
01:01:34,999 --> 01:01:40,375
Um, this didn't make it into the movie, but I will always remember it's not

954
01:01:40,375 --> 01:01:44,999
the guy with the white pants but the one next to him,

955
01:01:44,999 --> 01:01:48,792
he's obscured here, the camera comes around,

956
01:01:48,792 --> 01:01:54,125
they're lined up to present and the guy looks over and goes" oh,

957
01:01:54,125 --> 01:01:55,375
what the fuck?

958
01:01:55,375 --> 01:02:00,083
"Like, just that exasperation, God damn, a camera crew,

959
01:02:00,083 --> 01:02:02,375
I am pistoling!

960
01:02:04,417 --> 01:02:05,667
Pissin'!

961
01:02:05,667 --> 01:02:07,501
Anyway, don't go into the bathroom.

962
01:02:13,999 --> 01:02:18,375
The only reason we weren't allowed to film we unwittingly wondered

963
01:02:18,375 --> 01:02:22,542
up one of the crews wondered up behind Goons who were talking,

964
01:02:22,542 --> 01:02:25,999
never approach a Goon from the back!

965
01:02:26,250 --> 01:02:27,999
(Laughter.) And the Goons turned

966
01:02:27,999 --> 01:02:32,125
around and said" whoa, whoa, whoa, you can't film us "" no, no,

967
01:02:32,125 --> 01:02:36,209
no "so we made sure not to film them from a distance and not

968
01:02:36,209 --> 01:02:39,667
to record them because if they're making decisions

969
01:02:39,667 --> 01:02:43,999
and discuss it go and even at the screening last night there was

970
01:02:43,999 --> 01:02:47,999
a Goon incident but you didn't hear it right?

971
01:02:48,375 --> 01:02:52,834
Somebody decided well he was drunk all right, fine,

972
01:02:52,834 --> 01:02:58,375
that's base level, but he decided he didn't need to go all the way

973
01:02:58,375 --> 01:03:03,667
to the bathroom (Chuckles.) So he just pissed himself, pissed

974
01:03:03,667 --> 01:03:07,999
the area and fell off his chair asleep.

975
01:03:10,876 --> 01:03:14,999
(Laughter.) Thanks for the free beer, Jeff, and a Goon had to get

976
01:03:14,999 --> 01:03:17,999
up during the movie while the Goons are talking

977
01:03:17,999 --> 01:03:21,751
about how hard their job is and roll this drunk and get him

978
01:03:21,751 --> 01:03:23,501
out of there.

979
01:03:23,999 --> 01:03:25,999
You don't hear about that.

980
01:03:29,792 --> 01:03:32,709
So the Goons are always working on this and they are working

981
01:03:32,709 --> 01:03:35,918
on stuff that you don't see and they asked that we not have their

982
01:03:35,918 --> 01:03:39,459
internal discussions, otherwise it was free and clear.

983
01:03:40,999 --> 01:03:43,167
Best quote of the whole thing was we had

984
01:03:43,167 --> 01:03:44,959
this happen!

985
01:03:45,999 --> 01:03:50,083
I'm not going to tell you how they were but, yeah,

986
01:03:50,083 --> 01:03:53,999
so we said okay we won't shoot this!

987
01:03:55,999 --> 01:04:02,999
The best moment for me will always be, where I was shooting here,

988
01:04:02,999 --> 01:04:09,999
shooting behind Render Man and Render Man uses this slide which

989
01:04:09,999 --> 01:04:16,876
is the Comin sky problem, and I never see his talks, he wants

990
01:04:16,876 --> 01:04:22,292
to see my talks, he doesn't get to see me and that

991
01:04:22,292 --> 01:04:29,250
is the time I realized he was on stage somewhere and I consider

992
01:04:29,250 --> 01:04:36,876
Render Man a good speaker and so is Dan Cominsky and I was not aware

993
01:04:36,876 --> 01:04:44,584
of where Cominsky's talk was being held and this is a" dream "sequence

994
01:04:44,584 --> 01:04:50,250
as I'm standing behind somebody at his presentation,

995
01:04:50,250 --> 01:04:57,209
he mentioned something I'm like" I must be there now "and I run

996
01:04:57,209 --> 01:05:03,083
off the stage on to my Segue, my winged beast and fly

997
01:05:03,083 --> 01:05:07,999
through DEF CON at 20 miles an hour as fast

998
01:05:07,999 --> 01:05:15,667
as it goes and I pass Eddie and I'm like, Eddie, go to Penn and Teller

999
01:05:15,667 --> 01:05:23,209
and film Comin sky, and I'm like" Drew, see if you can film Comin sky

1000
01:05:23,209 --> 01:05:30,999
in Penn and Teller and I zoom in, there are 100 people and 20 minutes

1001
01:05:30,999 --> 01:05:37,999
into his own talk waiting to maybe get into his speech.

1002
01:05:37,999 --> 01:05:42,999
That's how for some places their job requirement

1003
01:05:42,999 --> 01:05:49,501
is the you must see Cominsky's speech live I zoom past them

1004
01:05:49,501 --> 01:05:53,417
like it's nothing "see ya bitches!"

1005
01:05:53,417 --> 01:06:00,751
I zoom into the room, rundown the center aisle, and jump on stage

1006
01:06:00,751 --> 01:06:05,918
and get behind Comin sky and start filming him

1007
01:06:05,918 --> 01:06:08,999
and nobody shot me!

1008
01:06:09,083 --> 01:06:10,999
I could just do this!

1009
01:06:10,999 --> 01:06:14,834
Truly God mode I just wall hacked DEF CON!

1010
01:06:14,999 --> 01:06:17,542
(Laughter.) And I ended up behind him and there

1011
01:06:17,542 --> 01:06:20,250
is a funny tweet from somebody going "what

1012
01:06:20,250 --> 01:06:22,626
the fuck subpoena with the cowboy?"

1013
01:06:22,626 --> 01:06:26,667
Like somebody is watch this gone from their room and they saw

1014
01:06:26,667 --> 01:06:30,999
the shot and here like "What's up with the cowboy" and then later

1015
01:06:30,999 --> 01:06:35,209
"Jason Scott" otherwise this would never had happened and we ended

1016
01:06:35,209 --> 01:06:37,751
up putting them together in the movie

1017
01:06:37,751 --> 01:06:40,876
because we had that reactiveness and Eddie came

1018
01:06:40,876 --> 01:06:44,083
in and started filming and I zoomed back and forth

1019
01:06:44,083 --> 01:06:49,709
to get both and get the goodbyes and the footage and everything else.

1020
01:06:50,167 --> 01:06:54,709
It was purely, purely luck that he even mentioned Comin sky at all,

1021
01:06:54,709 --> 01:06:56,542
weird moment.

1022
01:06:56,542 --> 01:06:57,542
Welcome!

1023
01:06:57,792 --> 01:07:01,792
JASON SCOTT: Thank you so much.

1024
01:07:01,792 --> 01:07:04,709
RACHEL LOVINGER: So the crew after we finished,

1025
01:07:04,709 --> 01:07:08,959
we debriefed and found that they had all been asked a lot

1026
01:07:08,959 --> 01:07:12,626
of the same questions over and over and over again

1027
01:07:12,626 --> 01:07:15,334
as they were doing this.

1028
01:07:15,334 --> 01:07:16,417
So some of the those questions were

1029
01:07:16,417 --> 01:07:20,542
straightforward, a lot of these things up here we have either already

1030
01:07:20,542 --> 01:07:23,667
answered or will answer by the time we get to the end

1031
01:07:23,667 --> 01:07:28,209
of this presentation and there were some that were out there.

1032
01:07:30,959 --> 01:07:34,167
The first one, people wanted to know when we wanted to film them,

1033
01:07:34,167 --> 01:07:37,584
if I agree to be in this am I going to end up feeling embarrassed

1034
01:07:37,584 --> 01:07:39,918
for being in this movie.

1035
01:07:42,375 --> 01:07:44,626
JASON SCOTT: Get rid of it.

1036
01:07:44,626 --> 01:07:46,501
RACHEL LOVINGER: The answer there is we did not set

1037
01:07:46,501 --> 01:07:49,918
out to intentionally embarrass anyone this is not a movie of look

1038
01:07:49,918 --> 01:07:52,999
at the weird hackers or that kind of thing.

1039
01:07:52,999 --> 01:07:55,250
We know that there is a lot of crazy shit that goes

1040
01:07:55,250 --> 01:07:57,667
on at DEF CON and we wanted to capture that

1041
01:07:57,667 --> 01:08:01,083
but everybody who was doing stuff like what you saw in this slide

1042
01:08:01,083 --> 01:08:04,709
they knew what we were getting themselves into.

1043
01:08:04,999 --> 01:08:08,083
We made sure of that.

1044
01:08:08,459 --> 01:08:12,083
People who were here last year that had these badges, people wanted

1045
01:08:12,083 --> 01:08:15,209
to know what our badge was because one of the parts

1046
01:08:15,209 --> 01:08:18,334
of the aspect of the badge challenge was you could

1047
01:08:18,334 --> 01:08:21,918
take the human badge and hold it up to another badge and

1048
01:08:21,918 --> 01:08:24,999
they would communicate with each other and they had

1049
01:08:24,999 --> 01:08:27,459
a aspect of the challenge to communicate

1050
01:08:27,459 --> 01:08:30,667
with all of the different kinds of badges so we had

1051
01:08:30,667 --> 01:08:34,250
a press badge which was a little bit rare, I guess, to find

1052
01:08:34,250 --> 01:08:37,375
and so people wanted to scan them.

1053
01:08:37,834 --> 01:08:39,999
At first we found it was disruptive, we couldn't get

1054
01:08:39,999 --> 01:08:43,834
down the hall once people started doing it and then we realized we could

1055
01:08:43,834 --> 01:08:46,709
interview the people so when they would come up and ask

1056
01:08:46,709 --> 01:08:50,083
to scan the badge and we would say, okay, you can scan it but talk

1057
01:08:50,083 --> 01:08:53,167
to us what you're doing here at DEF CON.

1058
01:08:53,167 --> 01:08:54,999
That worked out nicely.

1059
01:08:56,626 --> 01:08:58,542
This one was a little weird.

1060
01:08:58,584 --> 01:09:01,375
People asked us for help.

1061
01:09:01,999 --> 01:09:05,459
My only they would ask directions, the schedule, somebody came

1062
01:09:05,459 --> 01:09:09,918
up to me during one of the talks and said "guy popped his knee and

1063
01:09:09,918 --> 01:09:14,876
he needs a wheelchair and I was like, I am in no I'm filming a documentary,

1064
01:09:14,876 --> 01:09:17,834
I'm in no position to do that.

1065
01:09:17,834 --> 01:09:19,417
So we would point them toward the Goons or

1066
01:09:19,417 --> 01:09:24,083
toward other people that we thought could actually help them.

1067
01:09:24,125 --> 01:09:27,834
It was a little weird and the only reason I could think

1068
01:09:27,834 --> 01:09:31,292
of is because we had these original vests and sometimes

1069
01:09:31,292 --> 01:09:35,417
the orange vests and sometimes the walkie talkies and we looked

1070
01:09:35,417 --> 01:09:38,250
like authority figures but it seemed strange

1071
01:09:38,250 --> 01:09:42,083
at DEF CON walkie talkie, this guy is wearing silk pajamas,

1072
01:09:42,083 --> 01:09:45,417
for God's saying, not someone you should be putting

1073
01:09:45,417 --> 01:09:47,626
all your faith in.

1074
01:09:52,417 --> 01:09:57,459
Speaking of orange vests, not too much wanted to Rufie us

1075
01:09:57,459 --> 01:10:02,876
but    JASON SCOTT: Everybody wanted to Rufie us!

1076
01:10:02,876 --> 01:10:05,626
(Laughter.)    RACHEL LOVINGER: And as I mentioned

1077
01:10:05,626 --> 01:10:08,999
at the beginning these were custom made for our crew

1078
01:10:08,999 --> 01:10:13,083
but of course you can order orange vests anywhere but this was

1079
01:10:13,083 --> 01:10:15,250
a one time thing.

1080
01:10:16,999 --> 01:10:20,584
A lot of friendly people at DEF CON offered our crew drinks

1081
01:10:20,584 --> 01:10:22,999
at all times of the day.

1082
01:10:23,501 --> 01:10:27,959
Most of the time we were like, oh, we're working, thanks, no thank you,

1083
01:10:27,959 --> 01:10:29,626
maybe later.

1084
01:10:29,626 --> 01:10:31,999
Sometimes toward the end of the night we were known

1085
01:10:31,999 --> 01:10:35,083
to accept a beer or cocktail or in this case a swig

1086
01:10:35,083 --> 01:10:37,375
of homemade Absynth.

1087
01:10:37,876 --> 01:10:41,292
JASON SCOTT: Two words that need to go together!

1088
01:10:43,751 --> 01:10:47,751
(Laughter.)    RACHEL LOVINGER: So we were lucky that nobody Rufied us.

1089
01:10:49,999 --> 01:10:53,959
JASON SCOTT: There is footage of Eddie which is" Jason I have no

1090
01:10:53,959 --> 01:10:58,042
choice "hand come out, beer leaves and goes behind camera!

1091
01:10:59,459 --> 01:11:01,626
I'm sorry, Jason!

1092
01:11:01,626 --> 01:11:03,667
RACHEL LOVINGER: It all worked out.

1093
01:11:04,999 --> 01:11:09,667
A lot of people suggested we should make this every year!

1094
01:11:11,501 --> 01:11:13,167
No comment.

1095
01:11:13,167 --> 01:11:17,459
But in the end we didn't break anything, we didn't lose any of our equipment,

1096
01:11:17,459 --> 01:11:21,209
we didn't lose any of our footage, we didn't get in too much trouble,

1097
01:11:21,209 --> 01:11:23,667
I think it was a success.

1098
01:11:23,667 --> 01:11:27,999
After we were done we took our crew out to relax in Vegas

1099
01:11:27,999 --> 01:11:33,959
for a day    JASON SCOTT: We basically said we have no requirement

1100
01:11:33,959 --> 01:11:36,999
four for Monday and they were booked

1101
01:11:36,999 --> 01:11:41,542
through Tuesday they could have a day of their own,

1102
01:11:41,542 --> 01:11:48,626
they went go carting and we went to Pepper Mill and got to see Vegas.

1103
01:11:49,083 --> 01:11:54,751
For a couple of them this was their first time in Vegas, so the Encore,

1104
01:11:54,751 --> 01:11:58,542
the Pepper Mill, and so they could get their head

1105
01:11:58,542 --> 01:12:03,167
out of DEF CON, there is actually a Vegas here.

1106
01:12:14,999 --> 01:12:19,834
We're going to show footage until the end and until they kick us

1107
01:12:19,834 --> 01:12:21,999
out of the room.

1108
01:12:21,999 --> 01:12:23,167
Editing and finalizing.

1109
01:12:25,959 --> 01:12:31,417
At one point Rachel said how are you make the plot of this and I said" here

1110
01:12:31,417 --> 01:12:36,334
is how you do it "and this is literally what I drew and this was my

1111
01:12:36,334 --> 01:12:41,459
plan and she was like, not happy with the way I approach these things

1112
01:12:41,459 --> 01:12:43,999
is straight forward.

1113
01:12:44,999 --> 01:12:51,292
I watch the footage, put clips out, like" Render Man: I don't get nervous

1114
01:12:51,292 --> 01:12:57,375
before I speak "and that's what it's describing and another one" shot

1115
01:12:57,375 --> 01:13:03,626
walking from here to here "or it will be like" guy starts to get angry

1116
01:13:03,626 --> 01:13:07,083
but then realizes who we are.

1117
01:13:07,167 --> 01:13:08,959
Things like that.

1118
01:13:08,959 --> 01:13:12,584
So shots of things and I start to put them in a classification

1119
01:13:12,584 --> 01:13:16,626
and I build up sequences, where I'm like, here is a bunch

1120
01:13:16,626 --> 01:13:21,125
of people talking about there is lots of dripping I go at DEF CON

1121
01:13:21,125 --> 01:13:25,709
or speeches are hard to put together or I'm here to meet people

1122
01:13:25,709 --> 01:13:29,751
or these people are my family and I start assembling them

1123
01:13:29,751 --> 01:13:34,792
in great amounts perform then I start to put together like minded shots

1124
01:13:34,792 --> 01:13:38,999
over these sequences to illustrate things until finally this

1125
01:13:38,999 --> 01:13:42,999
is actually what the final piece look like.

1126
01:13:43,334 --> 01:13:44,876
Before I printed it.

1127
01:13:44,999 --> 01:13:48,999
So as you can see, there is well over 2 or 3,000 cuts

1128
01:13:48,999 --> 01:13:53,083
in the movie 3,000 cuts in the movie.

1129
01:13:57,083 --> 01:13:59,999
It was 278 hours of footage, I went

1130
01:13:59,999 --> 01:14:03,999
through that and produced 6,000 clips.

1131
01:14:04,083 --> 01:14:10,209
The 6,000 clips then got I probably used 1500 of them and then those 1500 had

1132
01:14:10,209 --> 01:14:14,751
something like 3,000 edits done to them.

1133
01:14:14,999 --> 01:14:20,999
In many cases I fix what people are saying, I take away um's and AH's,

1134
01:14:20,999 --> 01:14:26,542
I remove weird sounds, we have had position softwarewise so

1135
01:14:26,542 --> 01:14:34,334
I can remove clangs or phone rings or unintended air conditioning sounds.

1136
01:14:34,334 --> 01:14:37,999
I would do this at the end to remove the air conditioning sound you couldn't

1137
01:14:37,999 --> 01:14:41,751
hear what the person was saying over it and steadying the shots

1138
01:14:41,751 --> 01:14:45,417
and removing line noise or video noise so that they looked better

1139
01:14:45,417 --> 01:14:49,542
and I was pleased I got one sequence done and we were like, okay, there

1140
01:14:49,542 --> 01:14:52,999
is going to be a movie here and that was the speaker sequence

1141
01:14:52,999 --> 01:14:55,626
with Render Man and Comin sky, they were shot

1142
01:14:55,626 --> 01:14:59,584
with different footage and there was no question we have a movie here

1143
01:14:59,584 --> 01:15:04,250
and I was happy so that was months and months and months of work!

1144
01:15:04,250 --> 01:15:09,751
I put the final touch on the final thing for this thing

1145
01:15:09,751 --> 01:15:12,999
on June no, July 3rd.

1146
01:15:13,125 --> 01:15:19,250
So I was editing I took a month off and I would come back to it.

1147
01:15:19,292 --> 01:15:22,999
I estimate I have probably seen the full movie about 170 times.

1148
01:15:23,999 --> 01:15:28,667
I can sit here I do this with a lot of my movies and I sit in the back

1149
01:15:28,667 --> 01:15:33,083
and "mouth" everything everyone is saying and anticipate it and there

1150
01:15:33,083 --> 01:15:36,876
is a syndrome which I call "overfamiliarity syndrome" I

1151
01:15:36,876 --> 01:15:40,417
will shoot somebody dancing and live with it for months

1152
01:15:40,417 --> 01:15:43,542
and when I see the guy I will be like, "buddy!"

1153
01:15:43,542 --> 01:15:46,167
And he's like "who the fuck is this guy?"

1154
01:15:46,167 --> 01:15:48,876
And why is he asking why ear lovers and

1155
01:15:48,876 --> 01:15:53,459
the answer is because I'm been look at your face for over three months,

1156
01:15:53,459 --> 01:15:56,459
like some sort of creepy fans!

1157
01:15:56,459 --> 01:15:59,125
How do you get it in for Christmas, you don't!

1158
01:16:01,375 --> 01:16:02,792
No way.

1159
01:16:03,083 --> 01:16:06,334
It was a big stress and he was like "I made

1160
01:16:06,334 --> 01:16:10,667
a promise" so we compromised and made a 20 minute version

1161
01:16:10,667 --> 01:16:14,999
and considering that the movie was more footage than I had

1162
01:16:14,999 --> 01:16:19,584
ever dealt with before and the previous once were over a year

1163
01:16:19,584 --> 01:16:24,959
of editing, the fact that I was able to edit it in nine months is crazy

1164
01:16:24,959 --> 01:16:29,417
and enormous amount of work, well over 1,000 hours of editing

1165
01:16:29,417 --> 01:16:35,083
and fixing and refining and finding things and dealing with it.

1166
01:16:35,209 --> 01:16:38,999
There was surprisingly little editorial control executed upon me

1167
01:16:38,999 --> 01:16:43,209
by Jeff who had written the check and for paying me.

1168
01:16:43,501 --> 01:16:48,999
Jeff's check paid I took a flat fee up front that paid all my credit cards

1169
01:16:48,999 --> 01:16:52,667
off and paid off my car so I was debt free which

1170
01:16:52,667 --> 01:16:56,125
is the biggest gift in this world!

1171
01:16:56,125 --> 01:16:59,167
So I was debt free and that made a huge difference in my life so

1172
01:16:59,167 --> 01:17:01,876
for me the amount of work done was irrelevant

1173
01:17:01,876 --> 01:17:04,876
because my life was so much better.

1174
01:17:04,999 --> 01:17:09,584
So he didn't there was one part that mentioned a specific number

1175
01:17:09,584 --> 01:17:12,876
of how much something costs.

1176
01:17:13,209 --> 01:17:18,167
That said there could be contract problems to be publicizing that.

1177
01:17:19,501 --> 01:17:22,999
There was one sequence he asked to be taken down from 2:30

1178
01:17:22,999 --> 01:17:25,542
and I returned with a sequence that was 2:30,

1179
01:17:25,542 --> 01:17:29,125
so that didn't work and there was a couple of other shots where

1180
01:17:29,125 --> 01:17:32,918
they were like, does it have to be this shot?

1181
01:17:33,542 --> 01:17:37,792
And it was like, fine, for the fact that he completely paid

1182
01:17:37,792 --> 01:17:40,999
for it pretty much none, zero.

1183
01:17:41,083 --> 01:17:42,999
So that went really well.

1184
01:17:43,375 --> 01:17:45,083
It ended up being available here.

1185
01:17:45,876 --> 01:17:48,167
I had nothing to do with how they put it together and I'm amazed

1186
01:17:48,167 --> 01:17:50,125
at what they came up with.

1187
01:17:50,375 --> 01:17:55,999
You can download the movie for free, the tore rent is either up now or

1188
01:17:55,999 --> 01:18:01,999
will be today, and they have I wanted it on a USB stick.

1189
01:18:01,999 --> 01:18:07,083
Debates of it up to being on Blue Ray and I'm like, that's not

1190
01:18:07,083 --> 01:18:12,083
the way things happen now, it's USB, make it downloadable and

1191
01:18:12,083 --> 01:18:16,999
they created this crazy, deluxe lunch box hard drive thing

1192
01:18:16,999 --> 01:18:20,999
without telling me and it's amazing!

1193
01:18:20,999 --> 01:18:24,209
They thought they were I'll say this, they thought they were going

1194
01:18:24,209 --> 01:18:28,250
to sell 50 and they sold 50 the first day on preorder.

1195
01:18:28,292 --> 01:18:31,083
It was like, yeah, people love this friggin' thing so

1196
01:18:31,083 --> 01:18:32,792
it's hard!

1197
01:18:39,999 --> 01:18:46,667
This is them recording me asleep, Segue turned out to be a great idea,

1198
01:18:46,667 --> 01:18:49,667
throw one in the mix.

1199
01:18:50,250 --> 01:18:52,751
Alex will always get a shot.

1200
01:18:52,751 --> 01:18:54,292
See in the corner there!

1201
01:18:54,292 --> 01:18:58,751
Alex will always get in the shot!

1202
01:18:59,083 --> 01:19:02,542
RACHEL LOVINGER: To be fair Al electric was so excited to be here.

1203
01:19:02,542 --> 01:19:04,667
JASON SCOTT: He was excited to be here.

1204
01:19:04,667 --> 01:19:06,083
RACHEL LOVINGER: And he got excited    JASON SCOTT: So

1205
01:19:06,083 --> 01:19:08,501
something would be going on and he would get right

1206
01:19:08,501 --> 01:19:11,584
in it and he's adorable but he's everywhere!

1207
01:19:12,459 --> 01:19:18,417
And, you know, we didn't look at this thing as something we had

1208
01:19:18,417 --> 01:19:23,459
to "finish" like we're going to be done with a movie,

1209
01:19:23,459 --> 01:19:29,292
I wanted something that changed people's perception of DEF CON

1210
01:19:29,292 --> 01:19:35,834
or changed their love of DEF CON to something stronger or encouraged

1211
01:19:35,834 --> 01:19:42,999
people to understand how magical this thing is and how it happens.

1212
01:19:43,083 --> 01:19:44,918
I gave a year of my life to get that story

1213
01:19:44,918 --> 01:19:48,876
out and that's what we tried to do and this is our crew getting their bows

1214
01:19:48,876 --> 01:19:52,083
during the closing ceremonies and then running back into places

1215
01:19:52,083 --> 01:19:53,999
to keep filming.

1216
01:19:53,999 --> 01:19:55,918
RACHEL LOVINGER: I think some of them were filming while we were

1217
01:19:55,918 --> 01:19:57,125
on stage.

1218
01:19:57,125 --> 01:19:58,999
JASON SCOTT: Yes, they were.

1219
01:19:59,292 --> 01:20:01,999
That is the main part of our talk.

1220
01:20:03,709 --> 01:20:08,792
Let's swap so we're going to sneak this until they kick us out.

1221
01:20:14,999 --> 01:20:16,459
Oh, wow!

1222
01:20:16,626 --> 01:20:18,000
RACHEL LOVINGER: It's fun!

1223
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:21,626
JASON SCOTT: So I won't be able to do that, meats amazing!

1224
01:20:21,999 --> 01:20:23,042
Do it.

1225
01:20:23,042 --> 01:20:27,334
RACHEL LOVINGER: They're all in nope, not that!

1226
01:20:27,334 --> 01:20:29,999
JASON SCOTT: All right!

1227
01:20:29,999 --> 01:20:31,167
RACHEL LOVINGER: Here!

1228
01:20:31,167 --> 01:20:33,417
JASON SCOTT: This is exciting!

1229
01:20:33,626 --> 01:20:34,999
Do this!

1230
01:20:34,999 --> 01:20:36,751
You drive, I'll point.

1231
01:20:36,751 --> 01:20:40,876
(Laughter.)    RACHEL LOVINGER: Which one did you want me

1232
01:20:40,876 --> 01:20:42,999
to start with?

1233
01:20:42,999 --> 01:20:44,459
JASON SCOTT: Let's do this.

1234
01:20:44,459 --> 01:20:46,125
RACHEL LOVINGER: It's Karaoke.

1235
01:20:46,125 --> 01:20:48,709
JASON SCOTT: Click on extra bits!

1236
01:20:49,083 --> 01:20:52,959
So let me show you an example of something that's wonderful

1237
01:20:52,959 --> 01:20:55,999
and beautiful and I didn't use it.

1238
01:20:55,999 --> 01:20:58,626
It would be top left first one.

1239
01:21:00,999 --> 01:21:04,167
It's been awesome, I've met through my

1240
01:21:04,167 --> 01:21:09,626
the people who I have been going before me met a lot of interesting,

1241
01:21:09,626 --> 01:21:11,834
awesome people.

1242
01:21:14,083 --> 01:21:17,417
I would go to dinner with somebody and find

1243
01:21:17,417 --> 01:21:22,375
out later it was somebody extremely important that I had no idea,

1244
01:21:22,375 --> 01:21:26,542
they just forgot to mention or something.

1245
01:21:26,959 --> 01:21:32,209
But sorry.

1246
01:21:32,209 --> 01:21:34,334
I'm getting a little excited.

1247
01:21:34,334 --> 01:21:39,125
Um    JASON SCOTT: Yeah so there is somebody what he's saying

1248
01:21:39,125 --> 01:21:44,417
is I found a place where I belong and people and respect

1249
01:21:44,417 --> 01:21:49,209
and trust me and it's a beautiful moment!

1250
01:21:49,209 --> 01:21:50,834
I didn't put it in the end because I had

1251
01:21:50,834 --> 01:21:54,083
all these other beautiful moments, which beautiful moment is going

1252
01:21:54,083 --> 01:21:57,959
to get screwed without turning this movie into longer.

1253
01:21:59,542 --> 01:22:02,167
Let's skip that one, go to the third one.

1254
01:22:02,375 --> 01:22:07,083
This is the great stuff    Anyway, so what happened was    Mother

1255
01:22:07,083 --> 01:22:12,459
fuckers, mother fuckers    JASON SCOTT: You know we would get those

1256
01:22:12,459 --> 01:22:14,999
helpful responses!

1257
01:22:14,999 --> 01:22:16,209
(Wow, that was fun to write!

1258
01:22:16,209 --> 01:22:19,876
) Bottom left, I would hear things like this?

1259
01:22:19,876 --> 01:22:21,751
(Away from mic.) Keeps on shooting.

1260
01:22:21,751 --> 01:22:23,999
So as soon as we're done with this interview, I need to go

1261
01:22:23,999 --> 01:22:29,292
to the restroom but I can wait until we're done.

1262
01:22:40,292 --> 01:22:42,876
I don't want to miss this.

1263
01:22:42,876 --> 01:22:54,999
Are you telling Jason Scott that you need to take a dump?

1264
01:22:54,999 --> 01:22:55,999
Pretty much.

1265
01:22:55,999 --> 01:22:56,999
Red dump!

1266
01:22:56,999 --> 01:22:56,999
(Chuckles.)    JASON SCOTT: You have to listen

1267
01:22:56,999 --> 01:22:59,501
because you don't know what you're going to miss!

1268
01:22:59,501 --> 01:23:01,667
RACHEL LOVINGER: That was the red crew.

1269
01:23:01,667 --> 01:23:07,626
JASON SCOTT: Yeah so, um what's the oh, yeah, upper right.

1270
01:23:07,626 --> 01:23:08,584
Here is a case of me taking footage I didn't expect

1271
01:23:08,584 --> 01:23:10,834
and I decided to do something with it.

1272
01:23:10,834 --> 01:23:34,584
(Music Playing.) (Laughter.) A "special" moment.

1273
01:23:34,999 --> 01:23:36,999
Let's do the professional thing.

1274
01:23:36,999 --> 01:23:39,999
He says some of the most emotional things.

1275
01:23:44,209 --> 01:23:46,584
It's dead to me!

1276
01:23:46,584 --> 01:23:49,999
JASON SCOTT: He looked at his phone to see how

1277
01:23:49,999 --> 01:23:54,999
he was going to answer and we just destroy him!

1278
01:23:55,709 --> 01:23:57,834
We have the same phone!

1279
01:23:57,834 --> 01:24:02,999
Oh this part here I made the most friends when I was working

1280
01:24:02,999 --> 01:24:08,834
the scavenger hunt    DEF CON is important to me    Sorry,

1281
01:24:08,834 --> 01:24:10,999
I'm tweeting!

1282
01:24:11,999 --> 01:24:13,792
Sorry, I'm tweeting!

1283
01:24:13,792 --> 01:24:15,999
Are we tweeting that the DEF CON documentary crew

1284
01:24:15,999 --> 01:24:18,083
is making fun of you?

1285
01:24:19,999 --> 01:24:22,876
Come here for verbal abuse!

1286
01:24:22,876 --> 01:24:33,292
Scandinavian hunt charged my lig    Penis.

1287
01:24:33,292 --> 01:24:36,584
Peanut    I was going to tell you some things that you may

1288
01:24:36,584 --> 01:24:38,334
not realize.

1289
01:24:38,834 --> 01:24:40,459
Bring it out!

1290
01:24:40,459 --> 01:24:42,999
Great, are you ready?

1291
01:24:42,999 --> 01:24:44,459
Let's fuckin' do this!

1292
01:24:44,459 --> 01:24:48,209
I am so ready, I want you to think of this interview

1293
01:24:48,209 --> 01:24:55,375
as at scrotum that (Laughter.)    I'm going to scratch it gently then.

1294
01:24:55,375 --> 01:24:56,375
All right.

1295
01:24:56,375 --> 01:25:04,125
Grab the left nut of this story and just tug gently, let's not get hurt!

1296
01:25:04,125 --> 01:25:05,125
Okay.

1297
01:25:06,375 --> 01:25:08,751
So, fuckin' balls!

1298
01:25:08,751 --> 01:25:09,751
Go ahead.

1299
01:25:09,751 --> 01:25:10,709
We're trying to be professionals here we're

1300
01:25:10,709 --> 01:25:12,459
fuckin' professionals!

1301
01:25:12,459 --> 01:25:13,459
Hi.

1302
01:25:13,459 --> 01:25:14,459
All right.

1303
01:25:14,459 --> 01:25:19,250
So    JASON SCOTT: What's great about that is if you see

1304
01:25:19,250 --> 01:25:25,876
the movie that's what came just before it.

1305
01:25:25,876 --> 01:25:28,834
RACHEL LOVINGER: He came out with great stuff.

1306
01:25:28,834 --> 01:25:30,459
JASON SCOTT: Beautiful stuff.

1307
01:25:30,709 --> 01:25:34,792
There's a time lapse from Los Angeles to Las Vegas.

1308
01:25:34,876 --> 01:25:37,209
RACHEL LOVINGER: This is sunset.

1309
01:25:37,209 --> 01:25:38,292
JASON SCOTT: Do it.

1310
01:25:41,167 --> 01:25:47,999
Windows media player does not love you or care about you!

1311
01:25:47,999 --> 01:25:53,083
What happened here was that basically I ended up with this beautiful time lapse

1312
01:25:53,083 --> 01:25:57,584
and then I had this other one here where somebody sent me

1313
01:25:57,584 --> 01:26:02,626
a beautiful time lapse of the sundown at the Rio, it's flickering

1314
01:26:02,626 --> 01:26:07,626
because it made my shit flip out it was three gigs of jpeg's, and

1315
01:26:07,626 --> 01:26:12,209
after a while I was like, "this is going to be Friday night,

1316
01:26:12,209 --> 01:26:18,626
whatever" so it's absolutely beautiful footage that I never got to use, all right,

1317
01:26:18,626 --> 01:26:20,999
knock that one out.

1318
01:26:21,999 --> 01:26:24,167
This was the greatest thing that happened

1319
01:26:24,167 --> 01:26:27,834
in the entire world, third one up on the right.

1320
01:26:27,834 --> 01:26:29,334
Here is the deal not that one.

1321
01:26:30,584 --> 01:26:32,334
Pull this one up, boom!

1322
01:26:32,334 --> 01:26:37,459
(Music Playing.) Here is the deal, in the original footage they're shooting

1323
01:26:37,459 --> 01:26:41,918
and you can hear the team member go get this guy which

1324
01:26:41,918 --> 01:26:46,834
guy that guy and they turn and there is this guy!

1325
01:26:46,834 --> 01:26:49,999
I don't know this guy, I don't know him, we never knew who he was.

1326
01:26:49,999 --> 01:26:50,999
Bless this man!

1327
01:26:51,375 --> 01:26:55,834
So we're shooting party footage and this guy.

1328
01:26:55,834 --> 01:26:59,792
Now, I mean, this guy, he's a little bit 1, what's the word?

1329
01:27:00,125 --> 01:27:04,292
He's height, weight, nonratio bound.

1330
01:27:06,709 --> 01:27:11,709
He's dancing, and he's listening to this music.

1331
01:27:11,999 --> 01:27:15,334
And he is dancing and he doesn't stop.

1332
01:27:17,125 --> 01:27:25,542
And now most people who would be in this situation would go okay,

1333
01:27:25,542 --> 01:27:34,167
I got my shit done or calm down, leave, you can see the other people

1334
01:27:34,167 --> 01:27:40,501
in the back, the guy on the back left there, he's

1335
01:27:40,501 --> 01:27:48,999
like a wiry stick, and he's like, yeah, yeah, yeah, right?

1336
01:27:48,999 --> 01:27:50,083
And then this happened!

1337
01:27:50,083 --> 01:27:51,083
And he is back!

1338
01:27:51,083 --> 01:27:51,209
And if you look down at the crawler, we're nowhere near done,

1339
01:27:51,209 --> 01:27:52,999
this guy keeps on going!

1340
01:27:52,999 --> 01:27:56,167
So whenever we would have lagging energy on any of the teams,

1341
01:27:56,167 --> 01:27:58,999
it would be like 2 in the morning we would be

1342
01:27:58,999 --> 01:28:02,876
like "put your fucking hands up" and run back into the crowd

1343
01:28:02,876 --> 01:28:06,083
and doing nor filming and for the rest of the weekend,

1344
01:28:06,083 --> 01:28:09,999
"put your fucking hands up"    RACHEL LOVINGER: That was our

1345
01:28:09,999 --> 01:28:11,542
rally cry.

1346
01:28:11,542 --> 01:28:14,751
JASON SCOTT: So two or three minutes of him dancing.

1347
01:28:18,167 --> 01:28:23,918
I don't know who this guy is, he is incredible and I know he's

1348
01:28:23,918 --> 01:28:30,999
probably at his desk right now looking at this thing in December go "oh, fuck!"

1349
01:28:30,999 --> 01:28:31,792
"Oh, no!"

1350
01:28:31,792 --> 01:28:33,667
All right.

1351
01:28:36,999 --> 01:28:40,459
Let's do under water because it has a great line from Rachel.

1352
01:28:40,626 --> 01:28:43,375
RACHEL LOVINGER: We mentioned that these cameras,

1353
01:28:43,375 --> 01:28:46,334
the "Play Sports were supposedly able to go under water

1354
01:28:46,334 --> 01:28:48,751
but we weren't positive."

1355
01:28:48,751 --> 01:28:48,751
Hi, I didn't change the mood!

1356
01:28:48,751 --> 01:28:49,751
"   Scrotum real!

1357
01:28:55,834 --> 01:29:09,083
" In case this didn't work we're not telling Jason that happened, oh, sit,

1358
01:29:09,083 --> 01:29:11,999
I recorded that?

1359
01:29:11,999 --> 01:29:20,999
"(Laughter.)    He will only know if it works!

1360
01:29:20,999 --> 01:29:27,250
Did you think it up here    It's recording right now.

1361
01:29:27,250 --> 01:29:29,999
Go for it.

1362
01:29:29,999 --> 01:29:31,501
(Gurgles) it didn't turn off!

1363
01:29:31,501 --> 01:29:35,375
JASON SCOTT: So guess what they were pretty awesome.

1364
01:29:35,375 --> 01:29:37,250
We were able to put a few in there.

1365
01:29:38,083 --> 01:29:40,876
Did we fix the crash footage?

1366
01:29:40,876 --> 01:29:42,083
RACHEL LOVINGER: Yeah.

1367
01:29:42,083 --> 01:29:44,083
JASON SCOTT: This is a footage crash!

1368
01:29:44,083 --> 01:30:00,626
(Away from mic.) Creating a new race!

1369
01:30:00,876 --> 01:30:11,876
JASON SCOTT: I indicate this was a mating dance.

1370
01:30:15,667 --> 01:30:21,042
A young man nostalgic for himself    The PP 11 crash!

1371
01:30:21,042 --> 01:30:22,834
JASON SCOTT: Hardware crash!

1372
01:30:22,834 --> 01:30:25,000
You know, we definitely found time to pop out.

1373
01:30:25,125 --> 01:30:27,542
Let's go into the bonus things.

1374
01:30:30,542 --> 01:30:33,999
These are bonus features this is all on the USB sticks so

1375
01:30:33,999 --> 01:30:36,334
all these pieces here.

1376
01:30:36,334 --> 01:30:38,999
RACHEL LOVINGER: The ones you just saw were not.

1377
01:30:38,999 --> 01:30:41,834
JASON SCOTT: Those are once that are not in the thing.

1378
01:30:41,834 --> 01:30:43,709
Let me see if they capture a lot of these are meant

1379
01:30:43,709 --> 01:30:48,876
to be varying states of informative and I have very long things on CDC

1380
01:30:48,876 --> 01:30:54,125
and hacking for charity, things that were important stories.

1381
01:30:54,125 --> 01:30:55,876
And then there is    AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Away

1382
01:30:55,876 --> 01:30:59,626
from mic.)    JASON SCOTT: Let's make him the last thing!

1383
01:31:00,999 --> 01:31:02,584
Down one.

1384
01:31:02,584 --> 01:31:04,292
To the right, there you go.

1385
01:31:04,751 --> 01:31:05,834
There is this.

1386
01:31:05,999 --> 01:31:08,375
This story saved for all time.

1387
01:31:09,375 --> 01:31:13,417
So we had went to the New York New York

1388
01:31:13,417 --> 01:31:20,417
to that terrible Asian restaurant, Chinese joint and I had Mongolian Beef

1389
01:31:20,417 --> 01:31:25,959
and we went back and threw the party in the room so I got

1390
01:31:25,959 --> 01:31:30,417
a little bit too drunk, shall we say?

1391
01:31:30,751 --> 01:31:34,999
And at the end of the night as everybody was, you know,

1392
01:31:34,999 --> 01:31:40,501
as the party rolled down I ended up in my bathroom in my bedroom

1393
01:31:40,501 --> 01:31:43,792
and I just lost all of it!

1394
01:31:43,792 --> 01:31:45,999
Just like it looked like somebody grabbed

1395
01:31:45,999 --> 01:31:50,459
a big old plate of Mongolian Beef and threw it around the bathroom

1396
01:31:50,459 --> 01:31:54,334
and it was all of and while it looked like it was normal,

1397
01:31:54,334 --> 01:31:57,834
of course it didn't smell that way!

1398
01:31:57,999 --> 01:32:02,667
So, you know, we wake up the next morning and I'm intending

1399
01:32:02,667 --> 01:32:09,709
to clean it up, but everyone was like, oh, let's go get breakfast and we'll clean

1400
01:32:09,709 --> 01:32:15,999
it up after and we're rolling back to the hotel room and this poor made,

1401
01:32:15,999 --> 01:32:19,667
the look on her face was awful!

1402
01:32:19,667 --> 01:32:23,542
She walks out of the room and she looks at us and

1403
01:32:23,542 --> 01:32:29,876
she said" somebody in there go blat, it's so bad I go blat "we made

1404
01:32:29,876 --> 01:32:36,083
the maid at DEF CON volume mitt, ink we handed her $60 or something

1405
01:32:36,083 --> 01:32:42,751
as a tip and that's the Mongolian Beef story in a nut shell.

1406
01:32:42,751 --> 01:32:45,667
(Away from mic.)    Oh, yes.

1407
01:32:45,667 --> 01:32:48,083
And he's sitting naked many his bathroom and I'm like,

1408
01:32:48,083 --> 01:32:50,542
did you want some water?

1409
01:32:50,542 --> 01:32:51,999
Fuck you.

1410
01:32:52,792 --> 01:32:58,999
And I'm like no did you want    No, the AC had frozen and

1411
01:32:58,999 --> 01:33:06,292
the smell was awful and I was sweating bullets naked laying in a pile

1412
01:33:06,292 --> 01:33:09,999
of vomit on my own floor.

1413
01:33:09,999 --> 01:33:11,250
Whew, yeah, a high moment!

1414
01:33:11,250 --> 01:33:11,417
(Laughter.)    You were going to let me walk

1415
01:33:11,417 --> 01:33:15,083
out of here (Laughter.)    Without that golden footage!

1416
01:33:15,083 --> 01:33:18,292
You were going to be like, I had a good time, I threw some parties!

1417
01:33:18,292 --> 01:33:19,876
DEF CON was good!

1418
01:33:20,125 --> 01:33:22,501
For some reason I stopped going, goodbye!

1419
01:33:22,501 --> 01:33:36,999
(Laughter.)    Congratulation on 20 years Jeff I support you!

1420
01:33:38,125 --> 01:33:39,959
Very good!

1421
01:33:39,959 --> 01:33:42,999
That's not the only thing that happened

1422
01:33:42,999 --> 01:33:44,999
at DEF CON!

1423
01:33:44,999 --> 01:33:46,999
JASON SCOTT: What I love about that is you can hear there are

1424
01:33:46,999 --> 01:33:49,250
like 12 other people in the room because I'm going

1425
01:33:49,250 --> 01:33:52,209
through this whole crowd and they're all trying to stay as quiet

1426
01:33:52,209 --> 01:33:54,709
as possible while he tells this disgusting story and

1427
01:33:54,709 --> 01:33:57,584
they loose it as soon as I start talking.

1428
01:33:57,876 --> 01:34:00,292
Let's do the upper right one, top quality production,

1429
01:34:00,292 --> 01:34:02,209
blood pressure reel.

1430
01:34:02,209 --> 01:34:13,584
One of the things that I don't know    Quality production.

1431
01:34:13,876 --> 01:34:17,250
I look forward to seeing this in the film.

1432
01:34:17,250 --> 01:34:19,542
That exact thing in the film?

1433
01:34:19,584 --> 01:34:23,125
But are there principals and Jesus, balls.

1434
01:34:23,125 --> 01:34:24,459
It's the quiet one.

1435
01:34:24,459 --> 01:34:25,542
It's the quiet one?

1436
01:34:25,542 --> 01:34:26,542
What?

1437
01:34:26,542 --> 01:34:27,751
It's the Metro link.

1438
01:34:27,751 --> 01:34:31,209
It's the quiet ones that kill people though!

1439
01:34:34,959 --> 01:34:37,667
Oh that's the Chicago train!

1440
01:34:37,751 --> 01:34:41,250
Have fun in Chicago Wednesday!

1441
01:34:43,626 --> 01:35:00,834
Not that I know anything about the train going by here!

1442
01:35:00,834 --> 01:35:01,834
Busted!

1443
01:35:01,834 --> 01:35:02,834
Why?

1444
01:35:02,834 --> 01:35:05,292
We're contemplating the perfect fucking shot.

1445
01:35:05,292 --> 01:35:07,999
Whatever, get back to work or we'll throw you out!

1446
01:35:07,999 --> 01:35:10,999
(Sleeping noise)    JASON SCOTT: Not creepy at all.

1447
01:35:13,334 --> 01:35:15,999
Good shot of the room and us putting things

1448
01:35:15,999 --> 01:35:20,083
together and doing stuff and you know what this needs?

1449
01:35:20,083 --> 01:35:21,083
A close up.

1450
01:35:27,999 --> 01:35:31,334
(Laughter.) (Snoring.)    It feels like (Laughter.)    Ah, shit!

1451
01:35:32,709 --> 01:35:40,167
Blew out the transformer?

1452
01:35:40,999 --> 01:35:45,125
Everything is on batteries so it's still recording.

1453
01:35:45,125 --> 01:35:46,999
I have fuckin' light.

1454
01:35:46,999 --> 01:35:52,542
JASON SCOTT: I'm a nice guy but sometimes I'm not a nice guy,

1455
01:35:52,542 --> 01:35:57,209
you hear Russ giggling in the darkness.

1456
01:35:57,209 --> 01:35:59,167
I didn't want you to break your cord.

1457
01:35:59,626 --> 01:36:00,626
.

1458
01:36:00,626 --> 01:36:01,709
That is awesome, I have that completely on camera,

1459
01:36:01,709 --> 01:36:02,999
holy balls!

1460
01:36:02,999 --> 01:36:04,792
JASON SCOTT: I use" balls "a lot.

1461
01:36:04,792 --> 01:36:05,792
Okay porn Santa.

1462
01:36:05,792 --> 01:36:06,792
Epic.

1463
01:36:06,792 --> 01:36:07,999
What do you got there?

1464
01:36:07,999 --> 01:36:08,999
Random porn.

1465
01:36:08,999 --> 01:36:09,999
Yeah, porno!

1466
01:36:09,999 --> 01:36:12,167
JASON SCOTT: Never found out story there!

1467
01:36:12,167 --> 01:36:14,667
Ho, ho, ho, have some DEF CON porn, would you?

1468
01:36:14,667 --> 01:36:15,667
(Chuckles).

1469
01:36:15,667 --> 01:36:17,999
JASON SCOTT: That was happening at DEF CON.

1470
01:36:17,999 --> 01:36:17,999
(Crowd noise)    (Away from mic.)    (Away

1471
01:36:17,999 --> 01:36:17,999
from mic.)    JASON SCOTT: Come on, dude, be a buddy, come on guys,

1472
01:36:17,999 --> 01:36:21,667
come on, I love that, people are like, fuck no, and the guy is like come on!

1473
01:36:21,667 --> 01:36:22,667
Take the porn!

1474
01:36:22,667 --> 01:36:25,501
I love this, he's going around, people are making faces.

1475
01:36:25,501 --> 01:36:25,501
(Laughter.) Funny story about porn Santa, here is the deal,

1476
01:36:25,501 --> 01:36:25,501
he was going along and he found in a room a bag

1477
01:36:25,501 --> 01:36:25,999
of porn so his solution was to go out in the vendor area and handout

1478
01:36:25,999 --> 01:36:28,501
all the porn he found.

1479
01:37:18,292 --> 01:37:30,250
Here is the problem, the porn was actually

1480
01:37:30,250 --> 01:37:45,334
a trick being done by the Ninjatel guys and there was

1481
01:37:45,334 --> 01:37:56,125
a Ninja badge in there and unwittingly

1482
01:37:56,125 --> 01:38:08,417
he gave away a Ninja badge so there were no

1483
01:38:08,417 --> 01:38:13,375
hard feelings.

1484
01:38:13,375 --> 01:38:20,999
We have hours of epic events like this.

1485
01:38:20,999 --> 01:38:22,209
Places and people.

1486
01:38:22,209 --> 01:38:23,209
Yep!

1487
01:38:23,209 --> 01:38:24,209
That's us.

1488
01:38:24,209 --> 01:38:28,125
Lots and lots and lots, hey, American, good to see you guys, there is Sky Dog,

1489
01:38:28,125 --> 01:38:29,999
so it's neat.

1490
01:38:29,999 --> 01:38:43,876
Isn't it nice to have this piece of DEF CON history saved forever

1491
01:38:43,876 --> 01:38:54,334
on hundreds of USB sticks around the world.

1492
01:39:01,209 --> 01:39:22,083
DEF CON, definitely we're kid friendly, we have DEF CON kids here.

1493
01:39:22,083 --> 01:39:23,667
I love how many people fuck no!

1494
01:39:23,667 --> 01:39:24,667
I don't need this.

1495
01:39:24,667 --> 01:39:25,667
You know, no.

1496
01:39:25,667 --> 01:39:28,292
Apparently we have evidence of who doesn't need porn, yeah, look

1497
01:39:28,292 --> 01:39:30,834
at this they're negotiating.

1498
01:39:30,834 --> 01:39:31,918
I don't think really?

1499
01:39:31,918 --> 01:39:34,918
You guys, dude, free porn there is no way to take it you jerk!

1500
01:39:34,918 --> 01:39:35,999
Just fuckin' take it!

1501
01:39:35,999 --> 01:39:35,999
God damn it, Santa clause has so many people

1502
01:39:35,999 --> 01:39:37,083
to deliver to this year!

1503
01:39:37,083 --> 01:39:38,083
Yeah, sure!

1504
01:39:38,083 --> 01:39:40,834
I got to hit my contest, I hope that was good for ya.

1505
01:39:40,834 --> 01:39:43,083
JASON SCOTT: The epic journey of porn Santa.

1506
01:39:43,083 --> 01:39:44,167
People are coming in.

1507
01:39:44,167 --> 01:39:47,250
I think it's respectful to clear the room for the next crowd.

1508
01:39:47,250 --> 01:39:48,250
So thanks so much.

1509
01:39:48,250 --> 01:39:50,959
If anyone has a burning, burning, question I'll answer it right now,

1510
01:39:50,959 --> 01:39:52,792
if there is one.

1511
01:39:52,792 --> 01:39:54,334
Anyone have a burning question?

1512
01:39:54,334 --> 01:39:56,999
AUDIENCE MEMBER: When it the screening?

1513
01:39:56,999 --> 01:39:59,918
JASON SCOTT: Tonight at 8:00 in Track 3, I believe, it's

1514
01:39:59,918 --> 01:40:03,999
the track that" Hacker Jeopardy "is not happening in, but it's

1515
01:40:03,999 --> 01:40:06,626
at 8 o'clock tonight, and we will screen

1516
01:40:06,626 --> 01:40:11,042
the movie and answer questions and play a little other bonus footage

1517
01:40:11,042 --> 01:40:15,542
if people are still up for it and have a good time.

1518
01:40:15,542 --> 01:40:16,542
Was it worth it?

1519
01:40:16,542 --> 01:40:17,542
Of course it was.

1520
01:40:17,542 --> 01:40:18,792
It was a wonderful time.

1521
01:40:18,792 --> 01:40:21,501
Rachel and I had a lot of fights over many things and a lot

1522
01:40:21,501 --> 01:40:24,876
of screaming about get this and that done, but at the end

1523
01:40:24,876 --> 01:40:27,667
the product speaks for itself and I think we have

1524
01:40:27,667 --> 01:40:30,417
