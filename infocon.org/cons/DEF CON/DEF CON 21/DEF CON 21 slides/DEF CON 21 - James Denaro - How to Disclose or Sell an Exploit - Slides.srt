1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We've had problem last night with some

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,042
after hours parties when we convert to DJ zone and apparently

3
00:00:00,042 --> 00:00:01,999
the petting zoo was full of strippers.

4
00:00:01,999 --> 00:00:01,999
So, if you have children, don't bring them

5
00:00:01,999 --> 00:00:03,417
to the after hours parties.

6
00:00:03,417 --> 00:00:04,584
That's not a good idea.

7
00:00:04,584 --> 00:00:06,792
This is going to be the last talk of the day.

8
00:00:06,792 --> 00:00:09,792
And it's a 20 minute talk and a little bit of Q&A afterwards.

9
00:00:09,792 --> 00:00:10,792
So the mic is here.

10
00:00:10,792 --> 00:00:11,959
Don't block the exits.

11
00:00:11,959 --> 00:00:12,959
The seat bet works.

12
00:00:12,959 --> 00:00:14,918
Put the big end and little end together.

13
00:00:14,918 --> 00:00:14,918
We've got a few minutes between now and 6:00 so we're going

14
00:00:14,918 --> 00:00:17,167
to wait a few minutes to see if anybody shows up.

15
00:00:17,167 --> 00:00:18,999
How many this is your first DEF CON.

16
00:00:18,999 --> 00:00:19,999
Raise your hand.

17
00:00:19,999 --> 00:00:20,999
Two DEF CONs.

18
00:00:20,999 --> 00:00:22,999
How about you've been here five times.

19
00:00:22,999 --> 00:00:23,999
4s?

20
00:00:23,999 --> 00:00:24,999
Great.

21
00:00:24,999 --> 00:00:25,999
3s?

22
00:00:25,999 --> 00:00:26,999
Okay.

23
00:00:26,999 --> 00:00:28,542
So for guys the first time, nice?

24
00:00:28,542 --> 00:00:29,918
What needs improvements.

25
00:00:29,918 --> 00:00:30,999
Make sure it's legible.

26
00:00:30,999 --> 00:00:30,999
One of the talks in here yesterday, they were sending ideas written

27
00:00:30,999 --> 00:00:32,792
with a crayon and they were happy.

28
00:00:32,792 --> 00:00:35,167
We'll start it off and Mr. Jim will take care of it.

29
00:00:35,167 --> 00:00:36,167
So 20 minutes.

30
00:00:36,167 --> 00:00:37,667
So we get to start the party.

31
00:00:37,667 --> 00:00:37,667
JAMES DENARO: Thanks for coming to the last talk

32
00:00:37,667 --> 00:00:38,751
of Saturday evening.

33
00:00:38,751 --> 00:00:38,751
I'm fully aware of the fact that I'm all that is standing between you

34
00:00:38,751 --> 00:00:40,334
and a substantially better time.

35
00:00:40,334 --> 00:00:42,792
(Laughter) So we're going to do this quickly.

36
00:00:42,792 --> 00:00:44,667
This is basically a turbo talk format.

37
00:00:44,667 --> 00:00:46,709
20 minutes we're going to move quickly.

38
00:00:46,709 --> 00:00:46,709
All these slides will be made available online so,

39
00:00:46,709 --> 00:00:49,709
if you miss something, you can catch it on the slides later.

40
00:00:49,709 --> 00:00:51,626
Contact info will be on the last slide.

41
00:00:51,626 --> 00:00:51,626
With all the different parameters, so feel free to reach

42
00:00:51,626 --> 00:00:52,709
out to me afterwards.

43
00:00:52,709 --> 00:00:52,709
We'll be doing a little bit of a Q&A after this

44
00:00:52,709 --> 00:00:54,459
for anyone who's still here at 6:20.

45
00:00:54,459 --> 00:00:54,459
The topic for today is to disclose or sell an exploit without getting

46
00:00:54,459 --> 00:00:55,459
in it trouble.

47
00:00:55,459 --> 00:00:55,459
I'm Jim Denaro an intellectual property attorney based

48
00:00:55,459 --> 00:00:55,459
out of Washington, D.C., focus my work

49
00:00:55,459 --> 00:00:55,459
on security technologies, before I went to law school, I used

50
00:00:55,459 --> 00:00:55,459
to spend far too much time tweaking around on max bug

51
00:00:55,459 --> 00:00:55,459
on my power PC and figured that no better way to keep doing that than

52
00:00:55,459 --> 00:00:56,459
to do this.

53
00:00:56,459 --> 00:00:57,459
So here we go.

54
00:00:57,459 --> 00:00:57,459
Just because I'm an attorney and this does have some legal

55
00:00:57,459 --> 00:00:57,459
component to it, although this is not a law talk, really, I to give

56
00:00:57,459 --> 00:00:57,459
the standard disclaimer that this presentation is not legal advice

57
00:00:57,459 --> 00:01:00,542
about your specific situation or your specific questions.

58
00:01:00,542 --> 00:01:00,542
Even if you ask question a question, we're still talking about hypotheticals,

59
00:01:00,542 --> 00:01:00,542
if we develop a attorney client relationship,

60
00:01:00,542 --> 00:01:01,999
then we can give legal advice.

61
00:01:01,999 --> 00:01:05,459
This is not attorney client relationship alone through this talk.

62
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:06,834
We can maybe do that later.

63
00:01:06,834 --> 00:01:07,083
Just as a quick overview what we're trying to accomplish

64
00:01:07,083 --> 00:01:10,918
in the next 20 minutes we're going to cover the types

65
00:01:10,918 --> 00:01:13,999
of risks that are being faced by researchers,

66
00:01:13,999 --> 00:01:18,459
some risk mitigation strategies that researchers can take to try

67
00:01:18,459 --> 00:01:20,999
to reduce those risks.

68
00:01:20,999 --> 00:01:22,709
Some options for disclosing

69
00:01:22,709 --> 00:01:28,125
a vulnerability that may be less that ma I have less risk and then some

70
00:01:28,125 --> 00:01:33,667
of the risks that are associated with selling an exploit.

71
00:01:33,876 --> 00:01:37,125
The overall goal of this is to make yourself a harder target.

72
00:01:37,125 --> 00:01:42,792
If someone asks you well can I be sued if I do this or if this happens?

73
00:01:42,792 --> 00:01:44,334
The answer is always yes.

74
00:01:44,667 --> 00:01:49,334
You can always be sued by anybody for anything at any time.

75
00:01:49,501 --> 00:01:52,167
The only question is who's going to win?

76
00:01:52,167 --> 00:01:54,167
And the goal is to make it more likely that you

77
00:01:54,167 --> 00:01:57,667
will win which disincentivizes someone from actually suing you

78
00:01:57,667 --> 00:01:59,709
in the first place.

79
00:02:04,209 --> 00:02:07,626
So let's start out with just some great examples

80
00:02:07,626 --> 00:02:10,999
of the kind of research activities that might get

81
00:02:10,999 --> 00:02:13,334
somebody in trouble.

82
00:02:13,334 --> 00:02:16,083
For example, some of these these are generally real

83
00:02:16,083 --> 00:02:17,834
life cases.

84
00:02:18,125 --> 00:02:20,542
You found out how to see other people's utility bills

85
00:02:20,542 --> 00:02:23,334
by changing the HTTP query string.

86
00:02:23,709 --> 00:02:26,125
I talked to somebody at a party the other night who was wondering how

87
00:02:26,125 --> 00:02:29,292
to do that, he was wondering what to do about it.

88
00:02:29,375 --> 00:02:32,083
You discover your neighbor's Wi Fi is not protected.

89
00:02:32,083 --> 00:02:34,083
How did you find that out?

90
00:02:34,999 --> 00:02:38,999
You broke the crypto that's protecting some media that you had.

91
00:02:38,999 --> 00:02:40,459
It's getting more serious.

92
00:02:40,459 --> 00:02:42,751
There's actual money at stake or maybe you wrote

93
00:02:42,751 --> 00:02:45,459
a better remote access tool.

94
00:02:45,459 --> 00:02:47,876
That sounds like you might make a lot of money.

95
00:02:47,999 --> 00:02:50,709
So many of the same risks apply surprisingly

96
00:02:50,709 --> 00:02:55,083
enough whether you're just looking at changing HTTP strings or

97
00:02:55,083 --> 00:02:59,209
whether you're actually taking apart a DVD.

98
00:02:59,334 --> 00:03:02,501
So in general, we're talking about techniques.

99
00:03:02,501 --> 00:03:03,999
I've sort of defined it here.

100
00:03:03,999 --> 00:03:07,250
Broad spectrum, everything from denial of service,

101
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:11,125
a technique that might be used for denial of service attacks

102
00:03:11,125 --> 00:03:14,501
to something that's just you know more akin to sort

103
00:03:14,501 --> 00:03:17,417
of investigatory web browsing.

104
00:03:17,999 --> 00:03:22,209
First, when is there risk to a security researcher.

105
00:03:22,334 --> 00:03:26,918
There are three general areas where we see the risks starting to show up, one,

106
00:03:26,918 --> 00:03:29,834
there can be a threat of legal action before you go

107
00:03:29,834 --> 00:03:31,999
to a conference or make this disclosure,

108
00:03:31,999 --> 00:03:34,751
there's examples listed here.

109
00:03:34,876 --> 00:03:38,959
You might be the recipient of a legal action seeking

110
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:42,999
an injunction barring you from disclosing something

111
00:03:42,999 --> 00:03:45,626
before a conversation.

112
00:03:45,626 --> 00:03:46,999
So now removed from merely saber rattling

113
00:03:46,999 --> 00:03:50,459
to an actual lawsuit being filed against you.

114
00:03:50,459 --> 00:03:54,083
And then there's the possibility of a legal action being initiated

115
00:03:54,083 --> 00:03:58,292
against you after you make the make the disclosure.

116
00:03:58,292 --> 00:03:59,999
And these are all real examples.

117
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:03,334
Declan McCullough of CNet and his colleagues have

118
00:04:03,334 --> 00:04:05,417
written articles.

119
00:04:06,417 --> 00:04:08,542
I recommend them to you.

120
00:04:10,999 --> 00:04:14,250
Some of these seem to be around Blackhat and DEF CON

121
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:16,542
on a regular basis.

122
00:04:17,209 --> 00:04:19,125
That's when it can happen.

123
00:04:19,292 --> 00:04:21,999
Your number one concern is typically going to be

124
00:04:21,999 --> 00:04:24,834
the computer fraud and abuse act.

125
00:04:24,834 --> 00:04:26,501
You've probably heard about that lately the perhaps here

126
00:04:26,501 --> 00:04:28,501
at other conferences.

127
00:04:29,083 --> 00:04:32,125
The main issue is it prohibits access

128
00:04:32,125 --> 00:04:37,584
without authorization or exceeding authorized access.

129
00:04:37,959 --> 00:04:42,959
The two times you're likely to run into possibly exceeding authorized

130
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:46,626
access or acting without authorization would be

131
00:04:46,626 --> 00:04:49,584
in the investigatory phase of working

132
00:04:49,584 --> 00:04:54,459
on your whatever technique it is that you've got.

133
00:04:55,125 --> 00:04:59,083
And when you actually create a tool that performs whatever this

134
00:04:59,083 --> 00:05:00,999
technique is.

135
00:05:00,999 --> 00:05:03,459
You might actually have a problem or that tool does

136
00:05:03,459 --> 00:05:06,125
the act that is prohibited.

137
00:05:06,209 --> 00:05:08,250
So in light of everyone's talked much

138
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:12,626
about how vague this notion of the computer fraud and abuse act

139
00:05:12,626 --> 00:05:14,999
is of authorization.

140
00:05:14,999 --> 00:05:16,167
I've created a handy checklist to figure

141
00:05:16,167 --> 00:05:17,999
out if you might have a computer fraud

142
00:05:17,999 --> 00:05:20,083
and abuse act problem.

143
00:05:20,083 --> 00:05:22,459
(Laughter) There we go.

144
00:05:24,834 --> 00:05:26,999
Are you connected to the Internet?

145
00:05:27,292 --> 00:05:28,751
Probably.

146
00:05:28,999 --> 00:05:31,125
Are you accessing a remote system?

147
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:32,792
Probably.

148
00:05:32,792 --> 00:05:35,083
Do you have permission to access that system?

149
00:05:35,209 --> 00:05:37,083
This is the real hard question.

150
00:05:37,501 --> 00:05:39,999
It's really hard to know if you have permission,

151
00:05:39,999 --> 00:05:42,834
if you saw a banner go by that said you don't have access,

152
00:05:42,834 --> 00:05:45,250
you probably don't have access.

153
00:05:45,876 --> 00:05:48,417
But there are a lot of cases where it's not so clear.

154
00:05:48,417 --> 00:05:52,918
And that's really where you have this sort of like the Andrew Auernheimer

155
00:05:52,918 --> 00:05:57,626
situation where he's querying an API on a regular basis.

156
00:06:00,375 --> 00:06:03,834
There's no banner or clear prohibition for doing that.

157
00:06:03,834 --> 00:06:05,626
It was a public facing API after all.

158
00:06:06,792 --> 00:06:09,209
There are real risks in figuring out whether or not you

159
00:06:09,209 --> 00:06:10,999
have permission.

160
00:06:10,999 --> 00:06:12,584
But that's really all it takes.

161
00:06:13,626 --> 00:06:17,584
Unfortunately, it's not just about what you do.

162
00:06:17,999 --> 00:06:21,083
The computer fraud and abuse act is about what your friends do.

163
00:06:21,417 --> 00:06:23,999
I believe the risk of being caught up in conspiracy to violate

164
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:26,918
the computer fraud and abuse act is most certainly enhanced

165
00:06:26,918 --> 00:06:29,834
by the prevalence of social media today.

166
00:06:29,999 --> 00:06:34,167
If you're on Twitter or other easy to use social media platform,

167
00:06:34,167 --> 00:06:38,334
you're talking to your friends about how you might do something

168
00:06:38,334 --> 00:06:42,417
or answering questions about how you might do a certain thing,

169
00:06:42,417 --> 00:06:46,584
with a technique that you've developed, you're starting to head

170
00:06:46,584 --> 00:06:49,417
down the road of conspiracy.

171
00:06:49,417 --> 00:06:54,501
Conspiracy typically does require an overt act.

172
00:06:54,542 --> 00:06:56,999
In order to really fulfill the conspiracy and typically just

173
00:06:56,999 --> 00:07:00,125
discussing something with someone does not.

174
00:07:00,584 --> 00:07:02,959
But, if you start providing technical support

175
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:05,417
for something that someone else is doing,

176
00:07:05,417 --> 00:07:09,083
you're really definitely increasing the risk of being caught

177
00:07:09,083 --> 00:07:13,083
up in the conspiracy to violate the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act

178
00:07:13,083 --> 00:07:15,876
if not violating yourself.

179
00:07:15,959 --> 00:07:19,083
We've got examples where the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act has

180
00:07:19,083 --> 00:07:20,959
been applied.

181
00:07:22,334 --> 00:07:25,667
Because that's how we see how it's being applied if we look

182
00:07:25,667 --> 00:07:28,209
at examples and we can compare what we're doing

183
00:07:28,209 --> 00:07:31,375
to some things that happened in the past to other people

184
00:07:31,375 --> 00:07:34,667
and see how close those comparisons are.

185
00:07:34,667 --> 00:07:36,334
And since we're in Las Vegas, we actual absolutely have to talk

186
00:07:36,334 --> 00:07:38,209
about the case of Nestor.

187
00:07:38,626 --> 00:07:45,501
Nestor was really into video poker and he liked to play and play and play.

188
00:07:45,667 --> 00:07:47,876
He got really good at it.

189
00:07:47,876 --> 00:07:49,999
He played it so much that he discovered a bug

190
00:07:49,999 --> 00:07:53,999
in the video poker software that enable him to play one type

191
00:07:53,999 --> 00:07:57,834
of game and bid a bunch of money in that game and switch

192
00:07:57,834 --> 00:08:02,375
to another game and ate multiplier would be applied to his bid so when

193
00:08:02,375 --> 00:08:06,292
he won, he got this enormous payout, and he figured out how

194
00:08:06,292 --> 00:08:10,083
to reproduce this big and he and his friends were doing it

195
00:08:10,083 --> 00:08:12,999
and getting a lot of money.

196
00:08:12,999 --> 00:08:17,292
Eventually how these stories always end, he got caught and

197
00:08:17,292 --> 00:08:22,999
he was charged with violating the computer fraud and abuse act.

198
00:08:23,417 --> 00:08:26,999
He was looking at the computer we saw it's mostly

199
00:08:26,999 --> 00:08:31,209
unauthorized access or exceeding authorization that

200
00:08:31,209 --> 00:08:32,999
you had.

201
00:08:32,999 --> 00:08:35,792
And it's hard to imagine that sitting he didn't access the firmware

202
00:08:35,792 --> 00:08:37,999
or take the game apart.

203
00:08:37,999 --> 00:08:40,999
He sat there and pushed the buttons on the machine.

204
00:08:41,334 --> 00:08:43,999
How you could seed authorized action says to video access

205
00:08:43,999 --> 00:08:45,999
to video poker machine is mind boggling

206
00:08:45,999 --> 00:08:49,417
but those charges were assessed against him.

207
00:08:49,417 --> 00:08:54,626
Ultimately, the Department of Justice did not pursue the charges.

208
00:08:54,709 --> 00:08:57,334
They went ahead with other fraud charges.

209
00:08:57,334 --> 00:08:59,999
But, nonetheless, for some period of time, he was facing computer Fraud

210
00:08:59,999 --> 00:09:02,792
and Abuse Act for doing exactly that.

211
00:09:04,083 --> 00:09:07,083
It's also worth looking at the tragic case

212
00:09:07,083 --> 00:09:13,501
of Aaron Swartz who spoofed his MAC address to download journal articles.

213
00:09:13,501 --> 00:09:15,501
That was Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.

214
00:09:16,292 --> 00:09:21,125
Andrew Auernheimer, who allegedly conspires to run

215
00:09:21,125 --> 00:09:25,209
an automated script to plug in identifiers

216
00:09:25,209 --> 00:09:32,209
for iPads and get e mail addresses, didn't even do it himself.

217
00:09:32,209 --> 00:09:35,083
He's doing several years in federal prison for that.

218
00:09:35,125 --> 00:09:38,792
Also worth noting that Department of Justice as said

219
00:09:38,792 --> 00:09:42,083
in their manual that conspiracy to hack a honeypot

220
00:09:42,083 --> 00:09:46,083
with can violate computer Fraud and Abuse Act there's no end

221
00:09:46,083 --> 00:09:48,918
to the sorts of things that can violate

222
00:09:48,918 --> 00:09:52,125
the computer Fraud and Abuse Act so you're looking

223
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:55,999
at a situation where a computer Fraud and Abuse Act acts

224
00:09:55,999 --> 00:10:00,334
as an ex post facto law where the Department of Just sis is able

225
00:10:00,334 --> 00:10:04,751
to look at what you did after the fact and if they don't like it

226
00:10:04,751 --> 00:10:07,626
or they don't like you for whatever reason,

227
00:10:07,626 --> 00:10:12,667
you may be trollish for some reason, you're likely to be on the wrong ends

228
00:10:12,667 --> 00:10:16,959
of the computer Fraud and Abuse Act prosecution.

229
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,999
There's the company that whoever the target

230
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:29,959
is of this exploit can also pursue who's ever accessed

231
00:10:29,959 --> 00:10:33,918
the system without authorization.

232
00:10:34,999 --> 00:10:37,834
The question then is is there anything we can do to try

233
00:10:37,834 --> 00:10:40,167
to reduce our chances of being on the wrong ends

234
00:10:40,167 --> 00:10:42,459
of this type of lawsuit?

235
00:10:42,792 --> 00:10:46,667
Well, let's take a quick we don't want to go too far into statute.

236
00:10:46,667 --> 00:10:49,542
Not a continuing legal education conference.

237
00:10:49,542 --> 00:10:52,501
But let's look at the statute and see if there's key words we can

238
00:10:52,501 --> 00:10:54,501
at least identify.

239
00:10:54,999 --> 00:10:57,999
Here we are whoever having knowingly accessed

240
00:10:57,999 --> 00:11:01,209
the computer without authorization.

241
00:11:01,709 --> 00:11:02,999
Another part.

242
00:11:03,459 --> 00:11:07,999
Whoever intentionally accesses a computer without authorization.

243
00:11:08,083 --> 00:11:10,999
So one of the things you can do is to try

244
00:11:10,999 --> 00:11:15,959
to avoid unintentionally creating knowledge and intent.

245
00:11:16,501 --> 00:11:20,834
It's a little bit hard to do this for yourself if you intend

246
00:11:20,834 --> 00:11:26,918
to do something you can avoid doing it in connection with other people.

247
00:11:26,999 --> 00:11:30,999
So for example, I would suggest that you do not direct

248
00:11:30,999 --> 00:11:34,542
information about how to use some kind of technique

249
00:11:34,542 --> 00:11:38,834
to someone that you suspect or have reason to know is likely

250
00:11:38,834 --> 00:11:41,125
to use it illegally.

251
00:11:41,667 --> 00:11:44,209
Be careful when providing technical support

252
00:11:44,209 --> 00:11:47,584
for a new technique you've developed.

253
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:52,999
If I were your lawyer I would advise you not to answer that tweet if someone

254
00:11:52,999 --> 00:11:56,542
is tweeting into asking about how to make something more

255
00:11:56,542 --> 00:11:58,709
effective perhaps.

256
00:12:02,083 --> 00:12:04,501
Next slide is more detailed.

257
00:12:05,083 --> 00:12:07,999
Some more approaches that you might take.

258
00:12:08,125 --> 00:12:11,209
Don't provide information directly to individuals, especially

259
00:12:11,209 --> 00:12:15,876
if you're not sure who they are or what they might be up to.

260
00:12:15,876 --> 00:12:20,459
Consider just posting things on a Web site only.

261
00:12:20,999 --> 00:12:23,999
Do not post information to forums.

262
00:12:25,999 --> 00:12:28,083
Where you suspect or you or forms that are known

263
00:12:28,083 --> 00:12:30,918
to generally promote illegal activity.

264
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:33,999
If you publish it on your own Web site or have control

265
00:12:33,999 --> 00:12:36,584
of the post, consider disabling comments so you

266
00:12:36,584 --> 00:12:40,083
don't have a situation of people discussing potentially illegal

267
00:12:40,083 --> 00:12:42,375
uses of your technique.

268
00:12:42,375 --> 00:12:45,083
Lastly, don't maintain logs.

269
00:12:47,459 --> 00:12:49,501
(Laughter) So one of the things we've seen happen,

270
00:12:49,501 --> 00:12:51,542
that's enough of the computer Fraud and Abuse Act

271
00:12:51,542 --> 00:12:52,959
for now.

272
00:12:52,999 --> 00:12:58,709
There's not a lot you can do about it beyond just being careful.

273
00:12:59,292 --> 00:13:02,626
Let's move on to temporary restraining order.

274
00:13:02,626 --> 00:13:06,501
This is particularly timely, actually, because you may have read

275
00:13:06,501 --> 00:13:10,999
the story about the VW group and the mega most encryption that was

276
00:13:10,999 --> 00:13:13,709
used on the mobilizers.

277
00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:17,250
So European security researchers figured out how to bypass

278
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:21,501
the or discovered a flaw in the encryption that was used

279
00:13:21,501 --> 00:13:27,334
on the vehicle immobilizers used on Porsche and Audi and Bentley.

280
00:13:27,334 --> 00:13:30,751
And they were going to present this at the conference in Washington, D.C.,

281
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:32,999
in a few week and they got themselves slapped

282
00:13:32,999 --> 00:13:36,250
with a temporary restraining order preventing them from making

283
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:38,999
the disclosure at the conference.

284
00:13:38,999 --> 00:13:42,999
How did this happen and how can we keep this from happening again.

285
00:13:42,999 --> 00:13:45,250
We've seen this here at Blackhat and DEF CON.

286
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:48,667
The talks have been stopped by a temporary restraining order.

287
00:13:48,999 --> 00:13:51,209
Take a quick look at the factors that courts look

288
00:13:51,209 --> 00:13:55,083
at when deciding whether or not to grant a temporary restraining order

289
00:13:55,083 --> 00:13:57,999
to prevent a researcher from disclosing information

290
00:13:57,999 --> 00:14:01,584
about a vulnerability the VW group will they have temporary harm

291
00:14:01,584 --> 00:14:03,999
if the TRO is not issued.

292
00:14:03,999 --> 00:14:04,999
Good evening, sir.

293
00:14:04,999 --> 00:14:06,999
Who knows how this works?

294
00:14:06,999 --> 00:14:07,999
Is he a new speaker.

295
00:14:07,999 --> 00:14:08,999
Yes.

296
00:14:20,375 --> 00:14:24,209
It's really hard to be selected as a speaker to the DEF CON.

297
00:14:24,209 --> 00:14:26,083
You need to present talks to eventually have yourselves

298
00:14:26,083 --> 00:14:27,959
up here, right?

299
00:14:27,959 --> 00:14:29,167
I've been drinking all day.

300
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:36,999
A big round of applause for Jim.

301
00:14:41,083 --> 00:14:42,667
All right.

302
00:14:42,667 --> 00:14:44,209
One more order of business.

303
00:14:44,209 --> 00:14:46,959
We need a new person his first time at DEF CON.

304
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:48,125
First hand up right there.

305
00:14:48,501 --> 00:14:51,542
Red shirt, we've got extra, let's get more.

306
00:14:51,542 --> 00:14:52,542
Two people.

307
00:14:53,584 --> 00:14:55,542
First hand up over there.

308
00:14:55,542 --> 00:15:11,584
There we go.

309
00:15:11,584 --> 00:15:13,751
Cheers to our new speaker.

310
00:15:18,999 --> 00:15:21,999
Let's see if he can pick up where he left off.

311
00:15:22,501 --> 00:15:27,876
We're going to work on new material for tomorrow.

312
00:15:28,083 --> 00:15:29,083
Thank you.

313
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:36,999
JAMES DENARO: All right.

314
00:15:36,999 --> 00:15:37,999
So that was great.

315
00:15:37,999 --> 00:15:38,999
Thank you.

316
00:15:38,999 --> 00:15:42,167
So just a quick look at some of the factors that the court is going

317
00:15:42,167 --> 00:15:44,501
to look at when deciding whether or not to grant

318
00:15:44,501 --> 00:15:46,375
a temporary restraining order to someone

319
00:15:46,375 --> 00:15:48,751
like the VW group who wants to prevent something

320
00:15:48,751 --> 00:15:51,209
from happening at the conference.

321
00:15:51,334 --> 00:15:55,125
Will they suffer irreparable harm?

322
00:15:55,125 --> 00:15:56,999
They've got an embedded system.

323
00:15:57,542 --> 00:16:00,626
They're going to figure out how to break it.

324
00:16:00,999 --> 00:16:03,876
Impossible to figure out in a period of time.

325
00:16:05,083 --> 00:16:08,083
Probably irreparable harm.

326
00:16:08,459 --> 00:16:10,626
Money isn't going to fix it.

327
00:16:12,083 --> 00:16:14,584
That goes in VW group's favor.

328
00:16:14,709 --> 00:16:17,125
Will there be harm to the researcher.

329
00:16:17,999 --> 00:16:19,959
Your paper got delayed?

330
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:25,167
You couldn't put in some part of the algorithm, you have to pare back.

331
00:16:25,167 --> 00:16:28,167
Hard to see that as a huge harm to the researcher, might feel bad

332
00:16:28,167 --> 00:16:31,083
about that but in terms of the huge sums of money

333
00:16:31,083 --> 00:16:34,999
the VW group is going to have to pay to fix this, it's not going

334
00:16:34,999 --> 00:16:38,167
to look good for the researcher there.

335
00:16:38,167 --> 00:16:40,542
Public interest, this is a fun one because we might think

336
00:16:40,542 --> 00:16:42,876
the public interest clearly favors disclosing

337
00:16:42,876 --> 00:16:45,709
the vulnerability so it can be fixed.

338
00:16:45,999 --> 00:16:49,292
The court is probably going to go the other way

339
00:16:49,292 --> 00:16:54,999
on that and see that really, the risk to all these BMWs or Porsches

340
00:16:54,999 --> 00:17:00,083
and Bentleys and things being stolen is much greater, much more

341
00:17:00,083 --> 00:17:06,999
in the public interest than having your obscure crypto talk go forward.

342
00:17:08,626 --> 00:17:10,999
The last factor is the likelihood a requester

343
00:17:10,999 --> 00:17:13,250
will ultimately prevail.

344
00:17:13,334 --> 00:17:15,999
This is the one we need to focus on.

345
00:17:16,542 --> 00:17:19,250
Because the VW group has to have cause of action,

346
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:22,834
they can't just say we don't like it.

347
00:17:22,999 --> 00:17:27,375
They say here's why you need to stop.

348
00:17:27,375 --> 00:17:29,792
It's because you did something bad to us.

349
00:17:30,083 --> 00:17:34,876
And in the case of VW group, with the mega most case and also

350
00:17:34,876 --> 00:17:39,999
in the case of this Sysco disclosure, what we had was the use

351
00:17:39,999 --> 00:17:44,459
of copyrighted material and that was the hook that got

352
00:17:44,459 --> 00:17:46,959
the TRO to issue.

353
00:17:47,292 --> 00:17:49,709
So the obvious advice then is to avoid the use

354
00:17:49,709 --> 00:17:52,083
of copyrighted material.

355
00:17:52,083 --> 00:17:55,334
So, if you include source code or object code from whatever it

356
00:17:55,334 --> 00:17:59,167
is that you're working on, that gives leverage to whoever it

357
00:17:59,167 --> 00:18:03,083
is who wants to stop you from disclosing it.

358
00:18:03,375 --> 00:18:07,999
There is a fair use of exception if you use pieces of code.

359
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:10,626
That's a case by case analysis.

360
00:18:10,626 --> 00:18:12,876
You can't just say this is fair use.

361
00:18:12,876 --> 00:18:16,999
It depends on how much you use and other actors that are very specific

362
00:18:16,999 --> 00:18:20,999
to what's actually going on in your case.

363
00:18:20,999 --> 00:18:23,959
So just try to avoid it if you can.

364
00:18:23,959 --> 00:18:24,999
It may not be possible.

365
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:27,542
But to the extent you can do that.

366
00:18:27,584 --> 00:18:31,334
Also avoid dark net sources for whatever you're getting this stuff.

367
00:18:31,626 --> 00:18:35,083
In the mega most case, the court talked about the fact that

368
00:18:35,083 --> 00:18:38,626
the researchers obtained some information about how

369
00:18:38,626 --> 00:18:43,501
the Megamost system worked through some sketchy channels.

370
00:18:43,542 --> 00:18:46,083
I don't recall it saying exactly where they got it.

371
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:48,417
But it was some sort of Bittorrent PDP type thing,

372
00:18:48,417 --> 00:18:50,792
wherever they got it.

373
00:18:50,999 --> 00:18:53,999
It wasn't from VW group or mega most.

374
00:18:54,209 --> 00:18:56,501
So another thing you want to do is be aware

375
00:18:56,501 --> 00:19:00,792
of pre existing contractual relationships that you as a security researcher might

376
00:19:00,792 --> 00:19:04,792
have with the target of whatever it is you're working on.

377
00:19:04,999 --> 00:19:08,417
These contractual agreements could come in the form of a term of service,

378
00:19:08,417 --> 00:19:10,999
end user license agreements.

379
00:19:10,999 --> 00:19:13,834
Nondisclosure agreements or employment agreements.

380
00:19:21,417 --> 00:19:24,918
An end user license agreement might well have provisions

381
00:19:24,918 --> 00:19:29,626
in it that prohibit reverse engineering software for example and that might be

382
00:19:29,626 --> 00:19:32,083
what you're doing as part your exploration

383
00:19:32,083 --> 00:19:36,083
into your technique and that could give leverage to someone to try

384
00:19:36,083 --> 00:19:39,626
to stop using, oh, you've breached this.

385
00:19:39,834 --> 00:19:40,999
Nothing is for certain.

386
00:19:40,999 --> 00:19:42,751
It's just an argument they have.

387
00:19:42,751 --> 00:19:44,999
There's not much you can do about it.

388
00:19:45,459 --> 00:19:47,250
Pretty much every piece of software you have is going

389
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:50,999
to have some software assuming you've come to it legitimately.

390
00:19:56,083 --> 00:19:59,083
There's not a whole lot you can do about that.

391
00:19:59,083 --> 00:20:01,042
But you at least can be aware of the risk.

392
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:02,375
If nothing else.

393
00:20:07,959 --> 00:20:11,999
How far you need to do to mitigate the risk depends

394
00:20:11,999 --> 00:20:16,083
on the technique you've used in research.

395
00:20:16,083 --> 00:20:20,125
If you've done things that clearly look like some of the examples

396
00:20:20,125 --> 00:20:24,209
of what people have done that's gotten them prison time,

397
00:20:24,209 --> 00:20:27,000
that's something you need to be careful

398
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:31,834
of and maybe take more aggressive mitigation techniques in order

399
00:20:31,834 --> 00:20:34,626
to perhaps hide some of the information

400
00:20:34,626 --> 00:20:37,292
about what you're doing.

401
00:20:37,292 --> 00:20:40,584
So for example, if in the mega most case no one had

402
00:20:40,584 --> 00:20:44,501
identified that it was the VW group that was where

403
00:20:44,501 --> 00:20:49,000
the crypto system had been compromised, VW group would not

404
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:54,167
have been able to issue to go after a temporary restraining order

405
00:20:54,167 --> 00:20:57,000
against the researchers.

406
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,918
So perhaps there's an opportunity here

407
00:20:59,918 --> 00:21:03,792
for the conference going community to create

408
00:21:03,792 --> 00:21:10,459
a track where people could present things that sort of get a little asterisk

409
00:21:10,459 --> 00:21:13,626
or something next to it.

410
00:21:13,999 --> 00:21:16,959
This is something that had to be kept quiet.

411
00:21:17,083 --> 00:21:19,459
Confidential disclosure, trust the review board, this is going

412
00:21:19,459 --> 00:21:21,999
to be really cool but we can't tell you about what it

413
00:21:21,999 --> 00:21:24,918
is because then you won't get to hear it.

414
00:21:24,999 --> 00:21:27,375
So maybe that's one approach.

415
00:21:27,375 --> 00:21:30,959
I'd like to talk about some of the ways you might make

416
00:21:30,959 --> 00:21:36,999
a disclosure that are relatively less likely to get you in trouble.

417
00:21:37,584 --> 00:21:41,250
You can obviously disclose to the responsible party.

418
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:42,709
That's what we'd like to do.

419
00:21:42,709 --> 00:21:44,083
That's what the responsible disclosure paradigm

420
00:21:44,083 --> 00:21:45,999
is all about.

421
00:21:45,999 --> 00:21:47,667
You have a problem with the system.

422
00:21:48,334 --> 00:21:53,250
This is actually unfortunately, relatively high risk.

423
00:21:53,501 --> 00:21:55,999
And risk scales with the questionableness

424
00:21:55,999 --> 00:22:02,501
to whatever technique it was that you use to find out about this vulnerability.

425
00:22:02,501 --> 00:22:03,834
So, if you're connected to the remote system,

426
00:22:03,834 --> 00:22:06,999
you don't have permission, that's how you did it.

427
00:22:07,292 --> 00:22:09,751
It may not be a great idea to tell them about it

428
00:22:09,751 --> 00:22:13,959
because if they don't like it, they've got an action against you.

429
00:22:13,959 --> 00:22:16,501
If you're inconvenience, that's a problem for you.

430
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:19,959
You might think you're doing them a favor, they might not agree that you're

431
00:22:19,959 --> 00:22:21,959
doing them a favor.

432
00:22:22,083 --> 00:22:23,959
If you're able to submit them anonymously

433
00:22:23,959 --> 00:22:26,999
to whoever the vendor is or whoever the responsible party,

434
00:22:26,999 --> 00:22:28,751
that's great.

435
00:22:29,626 --> 00:22:32,999
Depends how good your op sec is, I guess.

436
00:22:33,292 --> 00:22:34,459
A lot of times you think you're anonymous

437
00:22:34,459 --> 00:22:36,083
by not as anonymous as you thought you were

438
00:22:36,083 --> 00:22:37,959
or hoped you were.

439
00:22:37,999 --> 00:22:41,999
That's a risk in yourself you need to consider.

440
00:22:42,417 --> 00:22:46,209
If you're a bug bounty, maybe you're at less risk, you can disclose

441
00:22:46,209 --> 00:22:50,083
to a government authority perhaps maybe you don't believe it

442
00:22:50,083 --> 00:22:52,999
will ever get to the vendor.

443
00:22:53,417 --> 00:22:55,834
But again, if you if your techniques were perhaps

444
00:22:55,834 --> 00:22:59,501
questionable, you might not necessarily want to be submitting it

445
00:22:59,501 --> 00:23:01,417
to a government.

446
00:23:01,417 --> 00:23:02,999
A governmental authority, you may want it separately,

447
00:23:02,999 --> 00:23:06,626
you may have an interest in keeping your identity anonymously.

448
00:23:07,083 --> 00:23:10,334
You may try to submit anonymously to the government

449
00:23:10,334 --> 00:23:15,083
but I don't know how much we can really trust that any more.

450
00:23:19,999 --> 00:23:23,667
Fortunately this is a legal talk, somewhat legal talk and you almost

451
00:23:23,667 --> 00:23:27,709
never get to a legal talk where someone will tell you something for sure,

452
00:23:27,709 --> 00:23:31,999
absolutely 100% you will not get in trouble if you do this.

453
00:23:32,125 --> 00:23:34,918
But for Natalie, we are in a case here where there

454
00:23:34,918 --> 00:23:37,584
is one group of people who really don't have

455
00:23:37,584 --> 00:23:41,999
to worry about getting in trouble with the computer fraud and abuse act

456
00:23:41,999 --> 00:23:46,417
when they disclose the vulnerability and here they are.

457
00:23:46,417 --> 00:23:48,918
Okay to disclose if you're one of these people.

458
00:23:49,083 --> 00:23:50,417
Although she really should not have been

459
00:23:50,417 --> 00:23:53,999
hacking the palace computer, we're not going to hold that against her.

460
00:23:56,083 --> 00:24:00,876
So we're thinking about ways that we might be able

461
00:24:00,876 --> 00:24:05,501
to leverage opportunities for security researchers

462
00:24:05,501 --> 00:24:12,125
to make disclosure while keeping the risk as low as possible.

463
00:24:15,751 --> 00:24:21,417
So we're working on creating a pilot program where attorney client

464
00:24:21,417 --> 00:24:27,584
privilege can be leveraged to hide the identity and the techniques used

465
00:24:27,584 --> 00:24:32,584
by security researcher in making a disclosure.

466
00:24:32,626 --> 00:24:34,751
So the concept works like this.

467
00:24:34,751 --> 00:24:36,292
The researcher would disclose the vulnerability

468
00:24:36,292 --> 00:24:39,999
to a trusted third party which would be an attorney.

469
00:24:40,125 --> 00:24:41,959
Only to the attorney.

470
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:45,999
It's critical that this be a completely confidential disclosure

471
00:24:45,999 --> 00:24:48,959
to maintain that attorney the confidentiality

472
00:24:48,959 --> 00:24:54,709
of that disclosure so that other entities in the outside can't get to it.

473
00:24:54,709 --> 00:24:58,125
The trusted third party does not publish the vulnerability on behalf

474
00:24:58,125 --> 00:25:01,584
of the researcher, however, the trusted third party does disclose

475
00:25:01,584 --> 00:25:03,999
the vulnerability to whoever the third party is,

476
00:25:03,999 --> 00:25:06,709
whoever has this vulnerability.

477
00:25:07,125 --> 00:25:12,999
The researcher remains anonymous through the entire process This

478
00:25:12,999 --> 00:25:17,999
is possibly abuse if there's no better option.

479
00:25:17,999 --> 00:25:21,918
It's a little bit cumbersome and there are some side effects chiefly

480
00:25:21,918 --> 00:25:24,375
that the researcher remains anonymous,

481
00:25:24,375 --> 00:25:29,083
doesn't get public credit for whatever the research was.

482
00:25:29,375 --> 00:25:33,125
But it is one possible way for the researcher to be able

483
00:25:33,125 --> 00:25:36,292
to disclose and remain about as anonymous

484
00:25:36,292 --> 00:25:39,292
as one could possibly get.

485
00:25:39,292 --> 00:25:40,999
So this is a pilot program we're currently

486
00:25:40,999 --> 00:25:42,501
working on it.

487
00:25:42,501 --> 00:25:44,876
We're kicking out the bugs right now.

488
00:25:44,959 --> 00:25:47,792
If anyone is interested in talking to us further about it,

489
00:25:47,792 --> 00:25:52,250
we definitely welcome your input and please see me afterwards.

490
00:25:52,834 --> 00:25:55,999
We should now turn to selling very quickly.

491
00:25:55,999 --> 00:26:00,083
Right now there is no law in the U.S.

492
00:26:00,083 --> 00:26:02,292
that prohibits the selling of an exploit.

493
00:26:03,083 --> 00:26:07,167
And that is a situation that is probably likely to change

494
00:26:07,167 --> 00:26:11,667
in the not too distant future but for now there's not too much

495
00:26:11,667 --> 00:26:16,584
to worry about unless your techniques in developing your exploit have

496
00:26:16,584 --> 00:26:20,292
problem, then you still have a problem.

497
00:26:20,292 --> 00:26:22,167
But the fact of the sale itself is not something that's going

498
00:26:22,167 --> 00:26:24,125
to get you in trouble.

499
00:26:24,459 --> 00:26:30,167
However, there's a lot of focus on this market now.

500
00:26:30,167 --> 00:26:31,876
And here's some recent articles from May

501
00:26:31,876 --> 00:26:36,792
of 2013 booming zero day trade as Washington experts worried.

502
00:26:36,999 --> 00:26:39,292
My favorite "The U.S.

503
00:26:39,292 --> 00:26:43,999
Senate wants to control malware like it's a missile" stuff is dangerous.

504
00:26:44,292 --> 00:26:46,999
So every year, the Congress has to pass

505
00:26:46,999 --> 00:26:51,417
the National Defense Authorization Act that sets the budget for DoD

506
00:26:51,417 --> 00:26:56,501
and includes a bunch of other stuff that gets stuck in there.

507
00:26:56,501 --> 00:27:00,918
And this year well, for 2014, the Senate version it hasn't been

508
00:27:00,918 --> 00:27:02,751
passed yet.

509
00:27:02,751 --> 00:27:04,876
It's still in Congress.

510
00:27:04,876 --> 00:27:09,667
The Senate version has provisions that seek to begin the process

511
00:27:09,667 --> 00:27:13,709
of regulating the sale of exploits.

512
00:27:14,501 --> 00:27:18,083
The bill the house version doesn't have this.

513
00:27:18,083 --> 00:27:19,834
This is still just in the Senate.

514
00:27:19,834 --> 00:27:22,083
But you know, I think this is where it's headed.

515
00:27:22,083 --> 00:27:25,250
The bill notes that the president shall establish process

516
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:28,709
for developing policy to control the proliferation

517
00:27:28,709 --> 00:27:31,209
of cyber weapons through a whole series

518
00:27:31,209 --> 00:27:33,626
of possible actions.

519
00:27:33,626 --> 00:27:37,334
Export controls, law enforcement, financial, diplomatic engagement

520
00:27:37,334 --> 00:27:38,999
and so on.

521
00:27:39,083 --> 00:27:45,584
The Senate armed services committee, that had the bill before it was passed

522
00:27:45,584 --> 00:27:51,999
to the rest of the Senate said they had some commentary on this.

523
00:27:52,083 --> 00:27:54,584
And they referred to the dangerous software,

524
00:27:54,584 --> 00:28:00,083
a global black market, a gray market, it starts to look really bad.

525
00:28:00,209 --> 00:28:02,834
But they note that there is we need to have a carve

526
00:28:02,834 --> 00:28:05,250
out for dual use software.

527
00:28:05,709 --> 00:28:07,292
And pentesting tools.

528
00:28:07,667 --> 00:28:10,834
In Europe, the European Parliament recently

529
00:28:10,834 --> 00:28:15,501
passed a directive, they're a little ahead of us this prohibition

530
00:28:15,501 --> 00:28:20,999
on the sale of tools as they call it, basically exploits, will be required

531
00:28:20,999 --> 00:28:23,999
to be enacted by all of the member states

532
00:28:23,999 --> 00:28:28,709
in short order and this provision prohibits the production, sale,

533
00:28:28,709 --> 00:28:31,709
procurement for use, import, distribution

534
00:28:31,709 --> 00:28:36,584
of these tools that can be used to commit these enumerated offenses

535
00:28:36,584 --> 00:28:40,417
which is pretty much all the bad things you can think

536
00:28:40,417 --> 00:28:43,209
of doing with a computer.

537
00:28:43,209 --> 00:28:46,792
However, there's an exception, very important exception.

538
00:28:47,083 --> 00:28:49,999
For tools that are he created for legitimate purposes such

539
00:28:49,999 --> 00:28:54,125
as the test or reliability of systems and further notes that there needs

540
00:28:54,125 --> 00:28:57,999
to be in order to violate this law, you need to have need to show

541
00:28:57,999 --> 00:29:03,083
a direct intent that the tools be used to commit some of the offenses.

542
00:29:03,501 --> 00:29:06,751
So in both cases, both U.S.

543
00:29:06,751 --> 00:29:08,667
and in Europe we're seeing this trend.

544
00:29:08,667 --> 00:29:12,876
Well, it's really going back to the definitional problem how do we

545
00:29:12,876 --> 00:29:16,626
define what an exploit is and how do we make sure that

546
00:29:16,626 --> 00:29:22,125
legitimate tool can still be bought and sold this is perspective.

547
00:29:22,125 --> 00:29:24,250
We don't know what the laws will look like but I would start thinking

548
00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:25,667
of this.

549
00:29:26,083 --> 00:29:27,999
Think about dual use tools.

550
00:29:28,083 --> 00:29:33,918
If you write something don't put it together as the next greatest hack.

551
00:29:33,918 --> 00:29:36,209
This is you're creating pentesting tools.

552
00:29:37,584 --> 00:29:39,876
This has gone on for a long time.

553
00:29:39,876 --> 00:29:42,626
If you look at software I'm sure you've all used it.

554
00:29:42,626 --> 00:29:43,626
Copy 2+.

555
00:29:43,834 --> 00:29:46,083
Apple 2 or locksmith?

556
00:29:46,459 --> 00:29:48,125
Backup software.

557
00:29:48,125 --> 00:29:49,999
And the manuals for these softwares have

558
00:29:49,999 --> 00:29:54,209
they elaborate disclaimers, this is being used to back up your floppy,

559
00:29:54,209 --> 00:29:58,083
this is not being used to make illegal copies.

560
00:29:58,083 --> 00:30:05,167
And that is really the conundrum and that's where exploits will go.

561
00:30:06,417 --> 00:30:08,999
Some exploits will never be able to be looked

562
00:30:08,999 --> 00:30:11,918
at as a dual use tool for sure.

563
00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:14,292
If you know, if sort of like if you have

564
00:30:14,292 --> 00:30:18,334
a nuclear missile equivalent of an exploit, it's hard to justify

565
00:30:18,334 --> 00:30:21,083
the pentesting value of that.

566
00:30:21,209 --> 00:30:27,083
For a lot of tools perhaps that's where they should go.

567
00:30:28,167 --> 00:30:29,959
If you are selling.

568
00:30:29,999 --> 00:30:31,501
Know your buyer.

569
00:30:31,626 --> 00:30:33,292
To the extend you go.

570
00:30:33,375 --> 00:30:39,999
I think regulation is just one bad outcome away.

571
00:30:39,999 --> 00:30:41,709
Someone in the U.S.

572
00:30:42,375 --> 00:30:44,751
is going to sell an exploit and going to go through some channel

573
00:30:44,751 --> 00:30:46,876
and get used against some U.S.

574
00:30:46,876 --> 00:30:48,667
Interest, we may not here about it.

575
00:30:49,501 --> 00:30:53,042
It may be secret but this will happen and then there

576
00:30:53,042 --> 00:30:58,083
will be a huge drive to stop this from happening quickly.

577
00:30:58,209 --> 00:31:01,125
It's the same reason as soon as if someone is murdered

578
00:31:01,125 --> 00:31:04,959
with a certain weapon that weapon has to be banned, that's

579
00:31:04,959 --> 00:31:08,876
the way laws are created is very reactionary and I expect that

580
00:31:08,876 --> 00:31:10,834
to happen here.

581
00:31:11,918 --> 00:31:13,999
Maybe you can prevent that from happening.

582
00:31:14,999 --> 00:31:16,792
Know your buyer.

583
00:31:16,999 --> 00:31:20,667
If you're selling something don't sell into channel that's likely to go

584
00:31:20,667 --> 00:31:23,999
into embargoing with the United States.

585
00:31:23,999 --> 00:31:26,250
Maybe your best bet is to sell it to the U.S.

586
00:31:26,542 --> 00:31:28,834
asking for assurance from your buyer.

587
00:31:28,959 --> 00:31:33,584
You don't have knowledge of someplace it's not supposed to go.

588
00:31:33,584 --> 00:31:37,999
You can be lied to, but you can't control everything.

589
00:31:38,375 --> 00:31:41,999
At least you can get assurance that it's not going to be used

590
00:31:41,999 --> 00:31:44,834
in some illegitimate way.

591
00:31:45,167 --> 00:31:47,667
Also, you can always use disclaimer language.

592
00:31:47,667 --> 00:31:50,542
So have nice examples of disclaimer language here.

593
00:31:51,083 --> 00:31:55,167
This huge chunk of text on the top is actually from a software product that

594
00:31:55,167 --> 00:31:58,501
many of you have probably used many times.

595
00:31:58,501 --> 00:31:59,501
It's good stuff.

596
00:31:59,501 --> 00:32:02,501
I've highlighted the best of the operative language in it.

597
00:32:02,501 --> 00:32:06,667
But, if you're selling something be sure to use disclaimer language that flows

598
00:32:06,667 --> 00:32:10,083
along these lines that would help you from being charged

599
00:32:10,083 --> 00:32:13,501
at being complicit in any sort of illegal use to which

600
00:32:13,501 --> 00:32:16,876
the software might eventually be put.

601
00:32:16,999 --> 00:32:20,083
And lastly, I'd just like to highlight this bottom little

602
00:32:20,083 --> 00:32:23,876
paragraph which is actually from the Apple iTunes store,

603
00:32:23,876 --> 00:32:27,999
end user license agreement that comes with that.

604
00:32:27,999 --> 00:32:31,626
And it requires that you agree that you will not use these products

605
00:32:31,626 --> 00:32:35,250
for any purpose prohibited to develop design or manufacturer

606
00:32:35,250 --> 00:32:40,375
production of nuclear missiles or chemicals or biological weapons.

607
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:41,375
My God.

608
00:32:43,083 --> 00:32:45,999
Words with friends, that's dangerous stuff.

609
00:32:46,501 --> 00:32:49,125
So thank you for coming.

610
00:32:49,125 --> 00:33:01,167
This is my contact (Applause.) We have time here for questions so,

611
00:33:01,167 --> 00:33:16,083
if people want to line up, I'm happy to entertain them as best we can.

612
00:33:16,083 --> 00:33:18,125
There are definitely free speech issues.

613
00:33:18,125 --> 00:33:21,083
Especially in the temporary restraining order context.

614
00:33:24,584 --> 00:33:25,999
Second amendment, sorry.

615
00:33:25,999 --> 00:33:32,250
Come see me about that.

616
00:33:35,250 --> 00:33:36,959
Question back here?

617
00:34:00,209 --> 00:34:04,459
What about using a corporation to limit your liability

618
00:34:04,459 --> 00:34:07,501
for disclosure or selling?

619
00:34:07,501 --> 00:34:09,417
Is that    JAMES DENARO: Corporations can be held liable

620
00:34:09,417 --> 00:34:11,709
in many cases even under the computer Fraud

621
00:34:11,709 --> 00:34:16,709
and Abuse Act it hasn't happened yet but a corporation could be held liable.

622
00:34:16,709 --> 00:34:25,083
AUDIENCE: A question regarding full disclosure versus

623
00:34:25,083 --> 00:34:29,999
responsible disclosure.

624
00:34:30,083 --> 00:34:32,209
So when we do it, we do it via responsible disclosure,

625
00:34:32,209 --> 00:34:35,209
we contact the vendor, we give them 30 days and we tell them

626
00:34:35,209 --> 00:34:37,834
our intent to publish and we publish everything so

627
00:34:37,834 --> 00:34:40,999
the actual vulnerability of how to do it so people can replicate

628
00:34:40,999 --> 00:34:43,209
and do whatever they want.

629
00:34:43,417 --> 00:34:47,667
In most cases the vendors get a hot fix in within a week and then

630
00:34:47,667 --> 00:34:52,250
if within 30 days they provide the hot fix, we write them and say

631
00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:55,918
to fix it install hot fix whatever.

632
00:34:56,083 --> 00:34:58,125
Sometimes vendors will say we need more time,

633
00:34:58,125 --> 00:35:02,250
maybe we'll negotiate a couple days, but sometimes they'll say we're not

634
00:35:02,250 --> 00:35:05,626
going to fix it and you come publish it.

635
00:35:05,751 --> 00:35:08,542
So I won't explain what we do for that.

636
00:35:08,542 --> 00:35:11,459
But Google recently published the fact that they plan

637
00:35:11,459 --> 00:35:15,083
to disclose vulnerability within 7 days.

638
00:35:15,083 --> 00:35:16,083
All right?

639
00:35:16,083 --> 00:35:17,501
To have a 7 day turnaround.

640
00:35:17,501 --> 00:35:20,999
So what happens if a company like Google I don't want to use

641
00:35:20,999 --> 00:35:24,667
the word threaten but intend to publish a vulnerable

642
00:35:24,667 --> 00:35:28,501
within the 7 day turn around, and the company says don't

643
00:35:28,501 --> 00:35:30,751
or we'll sue you.

644
00:35:30,834 --> 00:35:31,999
What happens?

645
00:35:31,999 --> 00:35:36,999
JAMES DENARO: Google is at risk if they have some kind

646
00:35:36,999 --> 00:35:40,083
of obligation not to.

647
00:35:41,584 --> 00:35:44,542
It depends on the specific circumstances of it.

648
00:35:44,999 --> 00:35:47,459
But in this case if no law has been broken,

649
00:35:47,459 --> 00:35:51,999
then Google could be published without any    AUDIENCE: The case

650
00:35:51,999 --> 00:35:56,334
for me, for example, where I contact vendor and say I've got

651
00:35:56,334 --> 00:36:00,459
the 10 vulnerabilities I intend to publish.

652
00:36:00,459 --> 00:36:03,209
And they come back and say I'm going to sue you same

653
00:36:03,209 --> 00:36:07,792
with Google where Google says we're going to give you 7 days, not 30,

654
00:36:07,792 --> 00:36:12,626
the company comes back and says Google I'm going to sue you.

655
00:36:12,999 --> 00:36:17,667
It's not the same as they're going to sue me.

656
00:36:19,083 --> 00:36:22,959
JAMES DENARO: That's the unfortunate part.

657
00:36:22,959 --> 00:36:25,375
Is it the case of how good your legal team

658
00:36:25,375 --> 00:36:28,999
is or how expensive your legal team is.

659
00:36:28,999 --> 00:36:30,334
JAMES DENARO: Exactly.

660
00:36:30,334 --> 00:36:32,125
AUDIENCE: How much do you charge?

661
00:36:37,584 --> 00:36:41,999
Wherever you want to meet him at to carry on.

662
00:36:41,999 --> 00:36:44,083
There's about 5 or 6 other people.

663
00:36:44,083 --> 00:36:45,709
So this talk is over with.

664
00:36:45,834 --> 00:36:47,709
We've got to get ready for the evening.

665
00:36:47,999 --> 00:36:50,999
Down the hallway, he'll answer the rest of your questions.

666
00:36:50,999 --> 00:36:51,125
Unfortunately, there's not a Q&A

667
00:36:51,125 --> 00:36:53,417
because it's been disassembled too.

668
00:36:54,292 --> 00:36:55,709
Thank you, all.
