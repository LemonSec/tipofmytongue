1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,751
BRENDAN: my name is Brendan O'Connor.

2
00:00:01,751 --> 00:00:04,334
There are three take aways

3
00:00:04,334 --> 00:00:14,292
the things we carry

4
00:00:14,292 --> 00:00:16,709
at every single level.

5
00:00:16,709 --> 00:00:19,751
We as a community have forgotten that

6
00:00:19,751 --> 00:00:21,417
to be a goal.

7
00:00:21,417 --> 00:00:22,999
Whoops, the Goons are noticed.

8
00:00:22,999 --> 00:00:24,999
Always!

9
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:38,999
(Cheers and applause!

10
00:00:38,999 --> 00:00:44,000
)    Raise your hand if this

11
00:00:46,999 --> 00:00:53,334
(Laughter.) You, the man knows how

12
00:00:54,501 --> 00:00:57,167
I got to get somebody tall to do that.

13
00:00:57,751 --> 00:00:59,542
The last guy

14
00:00:59,542 --> 00:01:01,375
so cool your jets.

15
00:01:01,375 --> 00:01:04,792
I want to introduce you to 2500

16
00:01:10,167 --> 00:01:13,125
(Applause.) So please, welcome

17
00:01:13,125 --> 00:01:16,584
first time speaker, congratulations!

18
00:01:16,584 --> 00:01:17,751
(Applause.) Up yours!

19
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:26,709
Oh my God we have

20
00:01:26,709 --> 00:01:28,083
all afternoon!

21
00:01:28,417 --> 00:01:30,083
BRENDAN: God, I love DEF CON.

22
00:01:41,626 --> 00:01:44,918
Now the gentleman

23
00:01:51,999 --> 00:01:57,292
We have forgotten to protect ourselves,

24
00:01:57,292 --> 00:02:01,459
many on the stage saying we have

25
00:02:01,459 --> 00:02:06,999
the evil hackers and they're using

26
00:02:06,999 --> 00:02:12,459
we have forgotten, it's important

27
00:02:12,459 --> 00:02:16,709
of our users and it's become

28
00:02:16,709 --> 00:02:22,375
Data into encrypted streams in order

29
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:26,083
and we will show you examples later.

30
00:02:27,083 --> 00:02:29,250
Final take away,

31
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:30,999
into the crowd.

32
00:02:31,083 --> 00:02:34,375
Everyone has seen

33
00:02:34,375 --> 00:02:39,083
in which hooking up a cell phone

34
00:02:39,083 --> 00:02:43,250
and someone going, oh my God

35
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:49,083
into a mall we'll never find him there are

36
00:02:49,083 --> 00:02:53,501
That doesn't work and it doesn't work

37
00:02:53,501 --> 00:02:57,501
going to work for everybody

38
00:02:57,501 --> 00:02:59,999
If you can put together

39
00:02:59,999 --> 00:03:02,834
everyone in the mall,

40
00:03:02,834 --> 00:03:05,167
out important information

41
00:03:05,167 --> 00:03:07,626
and use it against them.

42
00:03:08,209 --> 00:03:13,918
We need fundamental changes

43
00:03:13,918 --> 00:03:18,709
to request too much data and then

44
00:03:18,709 --> 00:03:23,584
as someone who has worked

45
00:03:23,584 --> 00:03:28,584
of transactions, we can't leak

46
00:03:28,584 --> 00:03:34,083
because our clients are

47
00:03:34,417 --> 00:03:37,125
If we don't do this we have lost

48
00:03:37,125 --> 00:03:39,834
adversaries and there

49
00:03:39,834 --> 00:03:41,834
a software developer.

50
00:03:42,626 --> 00:03:44,584
Why are we doing this?

51
00:03:45,083 --> 00:03:48,334
These guys have tons of information

52
00:03:48,334 --> 00:03:52,459
through Rio and there are hundreds

53
00:03:53,083 --> 00:03:57,999
And I was recently told

54
00:03:57,999 --> 00:04:02,959
is the government's area,

55
00:04:05,918 --> 00:04:07,999
This means two things.

56
00:04:08,999 --> 00:04:11,959
One, a lot

57
00:04:11,959 --> 00:04:15,709
is terrifying and, two, I am

58
00:04:15,834 --> 00:04:19,792
Not just because I told you this

59
00:04:19,792 --> 00:04:22,999
my sister well enough and

60
00:04:22,999 --> 00:04:25,083
and it's too late!

61
00:04:25,375 --> 00:04:27,709
Those of us in the room know that

62
00:04:27,709 --> 00:04:32,125
at securing things other than throwing

63
00:04:32,375 --> 00:04:37,083
But the government has no mop reply

64
00:04:37,083 --> 00:04:38,584
The good guys have it.

65
00:04:38,584 --> 00:04:42,250
But that's not true.

66
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:45,250
We may look

67
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:51,083
in a bunch of countries that are not

68
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:54,542
repressive governments and

69
00:04:54,542 --> 00:04:59,709
I'm hearing "the NSA needs that"

70
00:04:59,709 --> 00:05:03,626
as only the government can spy on us.

71
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:07,501
We hear that sunlight

72
00:05:07,999 --> 00:05:10,999
A recent study showed that cops

73
00:05:10,999 --> 00:05:13,083
less likely

74
00:05:13,083 --> 00:05:17,083
in complaints, and 60% les likely

75
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:19,959
When they did use force those officers

76
00:05:19,959 --> 00:05:23,626
in using the least amount

77
00:05:23,876 --> 00:05:26,375
This affect was not duplicated,

78
00:05:26,375 --> 00:05:29,834
and their forces refusing to wear

79
00:05:29,999 --> 00:05:31,751
If we can see what's going

80
00:05:31,751 --> 00:05:34,542
at our government and make sure it

81
00:05:34,542 --> 00:05:36,792
and safely as possible.

82
00:05:36,792 --> 00:05:40,667
If not, we are subject to blackmail,

83
00:05:40,667 --> 00:05:42,626
See, for example, Aaron Schwartz.

84
00:05:42,709 --> 00:05:45,709
So we need sunlight,

85
00:05:45,709 --> 00:05:47,751
We don't have time to wait

86
00:05:47,751 --> 00:05:49,209
Anyone know what this photo is?

87
00:05:49,209 --> 00:05:51,876
AUDIENCE MEMBER: A nuclear test.

88
00:05:51,876 --> 00:05:55,209
BRENDAN O'CONNOR: It's

89
00:05:55,209 --> 00:05:56,209
Tsar Bomba!

90
00:05:56,501 --> 00:05:58,250
We need to blow up this situation

91
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:00,999
to every single developer

92
00:06:00,999 --> 00:06:04,542
is no longer an acceptable use

93
00:06:04,999 --> 00:06:07,584
So I get called a stalker, not this stalker,

94
00:06:07,584 --> 00:06:10,501
an adorable kitten that

95
00:06:10,584 --> 00:06:12,999
I get called this kind of stalker.

96
00:06:12,999 --> 00:06:15,417
We all do creepy work in this room,

97
00:06:15,417 --> 00:06:17,876
to raise the issue

98
00:06:17,876 --> 00:06:19,834
of privacy

99
00:06:19,834 --> 00:06:22,876
not just the "good guys," such

100
00:06:22,876 --> 00:06:24,626
for good or evil.

101
00:06:24,999 --> 00:06:27,375
CreepyDOL

102
00:06:27,375 --> 00:06:30,667
combines wireless sniffing,

103
00:06:30,667 --> 00:06:32,918
visualization and grenade style

104
00:06:32,918 --> 00:06:35,918
to do realtime personnel tracking

105
00:06:35,918 --> 00:06:39,626
on a major urban area in realtime

106
00:06:39,626 --> 00:06:41,375
It is stalking as a service.

107
00:06:41,375 --> 00:06:43,125
That's what we're here today to see.

108
00:06:43,125 --> 00:06:44,999
There is one complication thought,

109
00:06:44,999 --> 00:06:46,999
or Andrew Auernheimer.

110
00:06:46,999 --> 00:06:48,918
The United States government has

111
00:06:48,918 --> 00:06:51,209
against legitimate security research,

112
00:06:51,209 --> 00:06:54,626
of us think that's probably not

113
00:06:54,999 --> 00:06:57,167
A lot of people in this room don't

114
00:06:57,167 --> 00:07:00,709
because he's a "troll" and

115
00:07:00,709 --> 00:07:02,999
things about nice people.

116
00:07:03,292 --> 00:07:04,751
But it doesn't matter.

117
00:07:04,792 --> 00:07:07,542
The thing about criminal law

118
00:07:07,542 --> 00:07:09,125
at this apple.

119
00:07:09,125 --> 00:07:11,667
Mighty Casey gets three strikes,

120
00:07:11,667 --> 00:07:15,083
We get one in the 3rd Circuit,

121
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:18,792
We need to take action

122
00:07:18,792 --> 00:07:22,999
researchers even when they seem

123
00:07:22,999 --> 00:07:25,125
but for all of us.

124
00:07:25,125 --> 00:07:26,792
If everyone in this room isn't going

125
00:07:26,792 --> 00:07:30,667
by this time next year we need

126
00:07:30,667 --> 00:07:33,792
Otherwise, hey that was only

127
00:07:33,792 --> 00:07:35,751
Except that Weev was in Arkansas.

128
00:07:35,918 --> 00:07:36,501
They dragged him

129
00:07:36,501 --> 00:07:37,959
because they thought

130
00:07:37,959 --> 00:07:40,709
a more favorable hearing, and

131
00:07:40,834 --> 00:07:42,125
Every internet connection goes

132
00:07:42,125 --> 00:07:44,083
in the United States, so

133
00:07:44,083 --> 00:07:46,459
up in prison we better protect Weev.

134
00:07:46,459 --> 00:07:48,834
This affects

135
00:07:49,083 --> 00:07:52,125
First, this side note: I wrote this

136
00:07:52,125 --> 00:07:55,999
with all the people on this list,

137
00:07:55,999 --> 00:07:59,125
a great, hacker lawyer,

138
00:07:59,125 --> 00:08:02,501
of people in this room, or

139
00:08:02,501 --> 00:08:06,709
Matthew Green, professor at Hopkins,

140
00:08:06,709 --> 00:08:09,125
Jericho "Space Rogan" Mudge.

141
00:08:09,125 --> 00:08:11,167
These are people you have heard

142
00:08:11,167 --> 00:08:14,209
be supporting even

143
00:08:14,209 --> 00:08:16,667
This affects everyone one of us,

144
00:08:16,667 --> 00:08:19,083
professors or itinerant hackers.

145
00:08:19,417 --> 00:08:20,999
And in the meantime we have

146
00:08:20,999 --> 00:08:24,751
because we cannot trust legal actions

147
00:08:25,083 --> 00:08:28,751
Therefore, CreepyDOL has not been

148
00:08:28,751 --> 00:08:32,834
because even though every court

149
00:08:32,834 --> 00:08:36,083
is A okay, same as sitting

150
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:39,292
the guy next to you talk too loudly

151
00:08:39,292 --> 00:08:42,751
about raising his next

152
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:46,083
which happens way too often,

153
00:08:46,083 --> 00:08:50,751
on the government not prosecuting

154
00:08:50,834 --> 00:08:52,125
I leave the next step

155
00:08:52,125 --> 00:08:54,250
to a braver researcher.

156
00:08:54,751 --> 00:08:56,375
Since I'm

157
00:08:56,375 --> 00:08:58,626
a serious disclaimer.

158
00:09:04,209 --> 00:09:08,167
(Laughter.) "This is not intended

159
00:09:10,709 --> 00:09:13,334
Let's talk

160
00:09:13,334 --> 00:09:15,459
CreepyDOL is not CFT work.

161
00:09:15,459 --> 00:09:17,999
I had to make this extremely clear

162
00:09:17,999 --> 00:09:19,709
DARPA tries real hard not

163
00:09:19,709 --> 00:09:21,667
out because they have had a bit

164
00:09:21,667 --> 00:09:23,834
in the last couple decades.

165
00:09:23,834 --> 00:09:27,083
But two CFT contracts did let me build

166
00:09:27,083 --> 00:09:29,999
system, which

167
00:09:29,999 --> 00:09:33,459
and the visualization system,

168
00:09:33,459 --> 00:09:36,083
clear at the moment called NAUM.

169
00:09:36,167 --> 00:09:38,584
So thanks, Mudge, if he's here,

170
00:09:38,584 --> 00:09:40,999
with his face on 'em with pride.

171
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:43,334
And this is a brief roadmap.

172
00:09:43,334 --> 00:09:43,999
First let's talk

173
00:09:43,999 --> 00:09:45,626
for this project.

174
00:09:45,834 --> 00:09:47,209
First we want

175
00:09:47,209 --> 00:09:49,417
from wireless,

176
00:09:49,417 --> 00:09:51,751
in the middle" partially

177
00:09:51,751 --> 00:09:53,918
to the "bad" kind of federal prison

178
00:09:53,918 --> 00:09:57,167
because design constraints help us

179
00:09:57,167 --> 00:09:58,999
And it turns out that doing

180
00:09:58,999 --> 00:10:02,542
like the Pineapple Jasager attack,

181
00:10:02,542 --> 00:10:03,999
We can do this without them.

182
00:10:04,125 --> 00:10:09,918
As you turn on a wireless device,

183
00:10:09,918 --> 00:10:15,999
of all known networks,

184
00:10:16,667 --> 00:10:19,125
As soon as a device thinks it

185
00:10:19,125 --> 00:10:22,459
all of its sync services will kick

186
00:10:22,459 --> 00:10:24,999
That means Drop Box, iMessage

187
00:10:25,042 --> 00:10:27,792
A lot of those

188
00:10:27,792 --> 00:10:31,334
get cool data from and

189
00:10:31,334 --> 00:10:34,000
that have public wifi,

190
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,709
of cool data pretty often.

191
00:10:37,542 --> 00:10:40,125
Over unencrypted wifi

192
00:10:40,125 --> 00:10:43,417
that's what we mean

193
00:10:43,417 --> 00:10:46,918
can see everything they're talking

194
00:10:46,918 --> 00:10:49,584
Sometimes they're talking over SSL,

195
00:10:49,584 --> 00:10:53,209
is in theory encrypted, but it turns

196
00:10:53,209 --> 00:10:57,000
is "us" have been leaking this cool data

197
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,209
and I don't know why.

198
00:11:00,417 --> 00:11:04,292
As they set it up or as we look

199
00:11:04,292 --> 00:11:08,209
to see neat data and the cool part

200
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:12,876
an awesome primary key we can just sit

201
00:11:13,083 --> 00:11:15,999
So maybe you make one small identity

202
00:11:15,999 --> 00:11:19,959
maybe halfway around the world

203
00:11:19,959 --> 00:11:24,125
with little boxes you drop another

204
00:11:24,125 --> 00:11:27,999
up a profile of who you are,

205
00:11:27,999 --> 00:11:31,667
is not that long range so

206
00:11:31,667 --> 00:11:33,375
on top of me.

207
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:36,792
Once we get one to ten

208
00:11:36,792 --> 00:11:39,709
over an area we have time

209
00:11:39,709 --> 00:11:44,167
I know your patterns and practice

210
00:11:44,167 --> 00:11:48,999
to you and if I want to blackmail you,

211
00:11:48,999 --> 00:11:52,459
and that you most don't want exposed.

212
00:11:52,459 --> 00:11:53,083
This

213
00:11:53,083 --> 00:11:55,083
knowledge is power, right?

214
00:11:57,334 --> 00:11:59,250
Our second goal

215
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:01,501
without communications.

216
00:12:01,501 --> 00:12:06,751
It's easy to say I will go to Verizon

217
00:12:07,709 --> 00:12:10,626
The problem is that is expensive

218
00:12:10,626 --> 00:12:14,876
a lawsuit student and when you go

219
00:12:14,876 --> 00:12:18,999
I would like to apply for a grant

220
00:12:18,999 --> 00:12:22,626
oh I'm doing Distributed sensor

221
00:12:22,626 --> 00:12:26,209
they back away slowly and then call

222
00:12:26,209 --> 00:12:27,918
(Laughter.) My Dean

223
00:12:27,918 --> 00:12:32,083
will not mention her name on stage

224
00:12:32,083 --> 00:12:34,918
to fund my work anytime soon.

225
00:12:36,083 --> 00:12:39,125
The other reason we're not going

226
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:43,375
the other cell provider is it provides

227
00:12:43,375 --> 00:12:45,125
out who I am.

228
00:12:45,125 --> 00:12:51,083
They pick up the box, read the ID

229
00:12:51,709 --> 00:12:54,999
Who has this device, we would

230
00:12:54,999 --> 00:12:57,334
the United States government.

231
00:12:57,626 --> 00:13:00,083
The tele come providers have

232
00:13:00,083 --> 00:13:04,125
in their offices just created

233
00:13:17,083 --> 00:13:20,999
Finally we have a third goal which

234
00:13:20,999 --> 00:13:24,999
the slides make tough "D" cry it's

235
00:13:25,083 --> 00:13:27,876
When one has

236
00:13:27,876 --> 00:13:30,459
to people this is a problem.

237
00:13:30,459 --> 00:13:31,999
It's the difference

238
00:13:31,999 --> 00:13:34,876
and writing a zero day and

239
00:13:34,876 --> 00:13:37,167
When every script kitty sitting

240
00:13:37,167 --> 00:13:41,125
the entire city, maybe we

241
00:13:41,334 --> 00:13:42,999
In the meantime we are not.

242
00:13:45,542 --> 00:13:48,375
Let's talk about background, couple

243
00:13:48,375 --> 00:13:50,209
One, I would like to pour one

244
00:13:50,209 --> 00:13:51,999
people everywhere.

245
00:13:52,125 --> 00:13:55,542
This works kind of like one

246
00:13:55,542 --> 00:14:00,999
because mostly they're this ultra low

247
00:14:00,999 --> 00:14:04,999
they he work well,

248
00:14:04,999 --> 00:14:09,709
and they sacrifice everything else

249
00:14:09,709 --> 00:14:12,918
He they work in horrible language

250
00:14:15,209 --> 00:14:20,834
But they sacrifice cost,

251
00:14:20,834 --> 00:14:23,876
of $600 apiece each.

252
00:14:23,876 --> 00:14:24,876
That's not good.

253
00:14:24,876 --> 00:14:28,083
I want something that I can write

254
00:14:28,083 --> 00:14:32,083
in Linux and an order

255
00:14:32,999 --> 00:14:38,459
And large scale surveillance,

256
00:14:38,459 --> 00:14:42,375
assume that

257
00:14:42,375 --> 00:14:47,876
all of the problems in CreepyDOL

258
00:14:47,876 --> 00:14:53,709
they will be happy to do as soon

259
00:14:53,709 --> 00:14:58,125
so thank Mr. Snowden, pour one

260
00:14:58,125 --> 00:15:01,999
because this stuff is really hard!

261
00:15:03,999 --> 00:15:06,626
Let's talk about the keep architecture.

262
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:10,751
First, hardware 37 this

263
00:15:10,751 --> 00:15:15,999
a terribly tortured acronym

264
00:15:15,999 --> 00:15:18,999
and they love acronyms.

265
00:15:24,999 --> 00:15:29,999
The same thing that

266
00:15:29,999 --> 00:15:36,083
decided they could sell it if they put it

267
00:15:36,292 --> 00:15:41,542
When those failed I could buy it

268
00:15:41,542 --> 00:15:45,959
like to thank them for my research.

269
00:15:45,999 --> 00:15:48,876
The other thing is it fits

270
00:15:48,876 --> 00:15:52,167
how many of you checked theirs

271
00:15:52,167 --> 00:15:53,667
for me?

272
00:15:55,209 --> 00:16:00,959
(Applause.) This is the old version

273
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:05,501
for the F bomb version 1 as it is for two.

274
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:11,209
If you can look at my hand and see it,

275
00:16:11,209 --> 00:16:13,250
of good hardware.

276
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:16,876
It holds a Raspberry Pi, model A,

277
00:16:16,876 --> 00:16:21,584
because every hacker needs

278
00:16:21,584 --> 00:16:24,584
I would like to apologize

279
00:16:24,584 --> 00:16:25,959
I bought 10% of the U.S.

280
00:16:25,959 --> 00:16:27,999
supply of the first round of Model As,

281
00:16:27,999 --> 00:16:30,999
they were only going to bring 100

282
00:16:30,999 --> 00:16:35,083
so I'm sorry I think I screwed

283
00:16:35,375 --> 00:16:38,083
There is a cheap plastic case,

284
00:16:38,083 --> 00:16:41,542
adapters that occasionally electric cute

285
00:16:50,999 --> 00:16:55,999
(Laughter.) It just happened last week,

286
00:16:55,999 --> 00:17:00,876
"only buy original Apple" so thanks,

287
00:17:00,876 --> 00:17:05,459
and hey I plugged it

288
00:17:05,459 --> 00:17:06,459
That's the idea.

289
00:17:06,459 --> 00:17:08,999
(Laughter.) So why two wifi?

290
00:17:09,334 --> 00:17:10,999
I don't want to bring

291
00:17:10,999 --> 00:17:12,375
so instead I'm going

292
00:17:12,375 --> 00:17:14,542
centralized communications.

293
00:17:14,542 --> 00:17:16,375
And we connect to local wifi.

294
00:17:16,709 --> 00:17:18,626
Brendan,

295
00:17:18,626 --> 00:17:21,999
is there municipal wifi that actually

296
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:25,250
No, there is wifi that doesn't work,

297
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:28,083
is a lot of coffee shops and bars.

298
00:17:28,083 --> 00:17:32,167
Every random dive bar has wifi now

299
00:17:32,167 --> 00:17:33,334
A lot

300
00:17:33,334 --> 00:17:36,167
agreements, though,

301
00:17:36,167 --> 00:17:38,459
your imbedded code sad.

302
00:17:38,667 --> 00:17:41,167
So I wrote

303
00:17:41,167 --> 00:17:43,584
It clicks on buttons so you don't have

304
00:17:43,709 --> 00:17:46,999
Available in GitHub right now,

305
00:17:52,999 --> 00:17:55,083
And again, thank you DARPA.

306
00:17:55,083 --> 00:17:57,167
(Applause.) Now we're going

307
00:17:57,167 --> 00:17:59,667
building from the bottom up.

308
00:17:59,667 --> 00:18:00,999
We talked about hardware,

309
00:18:00,999 --> 00:18:03,959
about the middle layer,

310
00:18:03,999 --> 00:18:04,959
REDDI CLE

311
00:18:04,959 --> 00:18:08,125
and control software, designed

312
00:18:08,125 --> 00:18:09,751
This is the first

313
00:18:09,751 --> 00:18:11,209
I mentioned.

314
00:18:11,209 --> 00:18:15,999
I made a whole presentation last year,

315
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:17,959
There has been a whole rewrite.

316
00:18:17,959 --> 00:18:20,459
It still works the same,

317
00:18:20,459 --> 00:18:23,209
and occasionally it doesn't break

318
00:18:23,209 --> 00:18:24,999
on my keyboard.

319
00:18:25,417 --> 00:18:30,501
Each radical node runs Couch TV,

320
00:18:30,501 --> 00:18:34,417
nicely, plus Engine X, Torr,

321
00:18:34,417 --> 00:18:38,999
software, a couple of Ruby Scripts,

322
00:18:38,999 --> 00:18:44,459
is Open Source it let's notes combine

323
00:18:44,459 --> 00:18:48,083
to every other node and we can do data

324
00:18:48,083 --> 00:18:52,375
in the hope that we can get the data

325
00:18:52,375 --> 00:18:55,083
with guns shoot the box.

326
00:18:59,667 --> 00:19:03,417
To make reverse engineering radically

327
00:19:03,417 --> 00:19:05,999
you boot a node

328
00:19:05,999 --> 00:19:10,083
a full description key, reads it,

329
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:13,751
the pin out and you throw it

330
00:19:13,751 --> 00:19:15,542
at their head.

331
00:19:15,999 --> 00:19:19,334
Once you've done that,

332
00:19:19,334 --> 00:19:21,834
Boot on it, you're good.

333
00:19:21,834 --> 00:19:22,584
If you pull it

334
00:19:22,584 --> 00:19:24,501
the encryption keys.

335
00:19:24,501 --> 00:19:26,709
As for Cold Boot, here is the thing.

336
00:19:26,751 --> 00:19:29,083
How many people dump liquid nitrogen

337
00:19:29,083 --> 00:19:30,834
in their house?

338
00:19:31,334 --> 00:19:34,626
There's two people who dump liquid

339
00:19:34,626 --> 00:19:35,999
I would love your house!

340
00:19:35,999 --> 00:19:37,999
For the rest of you, as soon

341
00:19:37,999 --> 00:19:41,125
to dump liquid nitrogen

342
00:19:41,125 --> 00:19:44,918
we have all won and we can go

343
00:19:46,834 --> 00:19:50,918
CreepyDOL is just

344
00:19:50,918 --> 00:19:55,876
they all do the network thing so

345
00:19:55,876 --> 00:19:59,792
to one place it's as good as home.

346
00:20:00,042 --> 00:20:02,709
Let's talk about the design

347
00:20:02,709 --> 00:20:04,876
It's a creepy doll, right?

348
00:20:04,959 --> 00:20:11,918
It's going to do as much as possible

349
00:20:15,375 --> 00:20:20,334
They have 256 RAM we don't need that

350
00:20:20,334 --> 00:20:25,626
the reason we do that is to be nice

351
00:20:25,626 --> 00:20:29,584
donate money

352
00:20:29,626 --> 00:20:34,792
We don't want to send them home

353
00:20:34,792 --> 00:20:40,751
to TOR and no one will track him

354
00:20:40,751 --> 00:20:45,959
at us so Distributed query

355
00:20:45,959 --> 00:20:51,042
all the data, on the PCaps we save

356
00:20:51,042 --> 00:20:54,876
we never send the PCaps home.

357
00:20:54,876 --> 00:20:58,459
We do centralized query

358
00:20:58,459 --> 00:21:01,459
types of questions,

359
00:21:01,459 --> 00:21:05,959
for coffee at 8:00 in the morning

360
00:21:05,959 --> 00:21:10,083
in the afternoon once you drag your

361
00:21:10,209 --> 00:21:12,999
We do these things

362
00:21:12,999 --> 00:21:16,167
because even though Distributed nodes

363
00:21:16,167 --> 00:21:20,292
they don't have hard drive storage,

364
00:21:20,292 --> 00:21:24,334
to do these data mining queries back

365
00:21:24,334 --> 00:21:29,083
out of the grid as fast as possible,

366
00:21:29,083 --> 00:21:34,125
and then we have a centralized point

367
00:21:34,125 --> 00:21:38,083
It's not command and control networks,

368
00:21:38,083 --> 00:21:41,626
And I'm serious about the X Box,

369
00:21:41,626 --> 00:21:44,083
We call this NAUM.

370
00:21:47,792 --> 00:21:54,959
Let's talk about the observation filters,

371
00:21:54,959 --> 00:22:01,125
they are per application and they take

372
00:22:01,125 --> 00:22:06,626
is for drop box, okay

373
00:22:06,626 --> 00:22:08,918
good to know.

374
00:22:08,999 --> 00:22:13,876
There is another filter that's processed

375
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:17,083
Look at the last line this is a screen

376
00:22:17,083 --> 00:22:20,542
is more data than

377
00:22:21,999 --> 00:22:24,667
I know exactly what version

378
00:22:24,667 --> 00:22:27,626
but if you didn't that would be useful.

379
00:22:27,626 --> 00:22:31,999
I know what version

380
00:22:31,999 --> 00:22:38,083
to exploit it remotely and I have

381
00:22:39,125 --> 00:22:41,999
In addition

382
00:22:41,999 --> 00:22:46,334
There is a lot of data and media,

383
00:22:46,626 --> 00:22:51,876
Observation filters are per service,

384
00:22:51,876 --> 00:22:56,334
is that we build up tiny bits

385
00:22:56,334 --> 00:23:00,834
and co less them

386
00:23:06,999 --> 00:23:09,083
We get a little bit

387
00:23:09,083 --> 00:23:11,626
from the feed reader, how many

388
00:23:11,626 --> 00:23:14,209
after Google reader collapsed?

389
00:23:14,918 --> 00:23:16,709
About a quarter of you.

390
00:23:16,918 --> 00:23:20,999
How many you watch the stuff

391
00:23:21,375 --> 00:23:23,083
Nobody.

392
00:23:23,375 --> 00:23:27,918
Turns out the ones that I switched

393
00:23:27,918 --> 00:23:29,834
in the clear.

394
00:23:29,876 --> 00:23:33,334
Weirdly they transmit my real name

395
00:23:33,334 --> 00:23:36,542
an authentication cookie

396
00:23:36,542 --> 00:23:40,334
of Fire Sheep because a lot

397
00:23:40,334 --> 00:23:42,792
with Google Reader,

398
00:23:42,792 --> 00:23:45,999
out of your online dating profile

399
00:23:45,999 --> 00:23:48,209
and you are disgusting!

400
00:23:51,959 --> 00:23:54,999
(Laughter.) Back to the NAUM filters.

401
00:23:54,999 --> 00:23:57,959
There are the nosiness filters and

402
00:23:57,959 --> 00:24:00,999
Nosiness takes a little bit of data

403
00:24:00,999 --> 00:24:05,792
with user names, email addresses,

404
00:24:05,792 --> 00:24:08,083
it checks

405
00:24:08,083 --> 00:24:10,834
and even though we have been

406
00:24:10,834 --> 00:24:14,125
about the forgot password

407
00:24:14,125 --> 00:24:16,751
they have that system.

408
00:24:22,459 --> 00:24:26,375
I could then before break

409
00:24:26,375 --> 00:24:30,083
things and be more or less

410
00:24:30,083 --> 00:24:32,999
Finally there is mining nodes

411
00:24:32,999 --> 00:24:35,417
and do pattern and practice.

412
00:24:37,667 --> 00:24:40,709
I mentioned before where do they go

413
00:24:40,709 --> 00:24:43,792
that's one thing,

414
00:24:43,792 --> 00:24:45,542
For instance,

415
00:24:45,542 --> 00:24:49,999
around a city, I see it everywhere,

416
00:24:50,999 --> 00:24:54,501
What if I see another device that only

417
00:24:54,501 --> 00:24:57,292
every time it exists it's

418
00:24:57,292 --> 00:25:00,209
as the first device that I saw.

419
00:25:00,667 --> 00:25:03,250
So what happens

420
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:07,083
and a second device turns o works

421
00:25:07,083 --> 00:25:10,999
off and I don't see it again

422
00:25:10,999 --> 00:25:12,834
That's what we call a laptop.

423
00:25:14,167 --> 00:25:18,792
Once I've seen that for a while,

424
00:25:18,792 --> 00:25:20,959
instead of two.

425
00:25:20,999 --> 00:25:24,918
So even if you thought, hey,

426
00:25:24,918 --> 00:25:28,959
but I only do my creepy stuff

427
00:25:28,959 --> 00:25:33,959
because Brandon will never see me,

428
00:25:33,959 --> 00:25:37,083
the shops that you go to,

429
00:25:37,083 --> 00:25:41,250
I didn't know you could buy them that

430
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:45,083
is the CreepyDOL architecture,

431
00:25:45,083 --> 00:25:48,918
they're connected to every other node.

432
00:25:49,083 --> 00:25:53,751
They go to a sync node and the idea

433
00:25:53,751 --> 00:25:57,083
for information propagation

434
00:25:57,083 --> 00:26:00,959
of these boxes I run it

435
00:26:03,125 --> 00:26:06,918
It's job is to send

436
00:26:06,918 --> 00:26:09,918
in another storage mechanism.

437
00:26:09,918 --> 00:26:14,626
I have two different storage that I use

438
00:26:14,626 --> 00:26:19,250
and it's an all in memory

439
00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:24,542
if I had big data I could throw them

440
00:26:24,542 --> 00:26:29,626
in another one and it allows me

441
00:26:36,375 --> 00:26:41,292
Then I have translation

442
00:26:41,292 --> 00:26:44,501
into a saner format.

443
00:26:44,999 --> 00:26:48,626
Finally I run them

444
00:26:48,626 --> 00:26:53,918
down in parenthesis there it's running

445
00:26:53,918 --> 00:26:58,626
and my people are real,

446
00:26:59,834 --> 00:27:04,083
I'm getting GPS data so I might

447
00:27:14,083 --> 00:27:19,918
You the Unity game engine it's free

448
00:27:19,959 --> 00:27:22,999
The second note, Java Script

449
00:27:22,999 --> 00:27:26,876
by a proprietary games manufacturer

450
00:27:26,876 --> 00:27:30,876
into the dot net Lang beige

451
00:27:30,876 --> 00:27:36,709
and it's a horrible debugging platform,

452
00:27:36,709 --> 00:27:40,876
Java script errors

453
00:27:40,876 --> 00:27:44,999
by four other language

454
00:27:44,999 --> 00:27:50,083
is it works well the guys

455
00:27:59,709 --> 00:28:05,792
If you have ever tried to write utilization,

456
00:28:05,792 --> 00:28:10,584
say put this here and it works well you

457
00:28:10,584 --> 00:28:15,250
between latitude and longitude

458
00:28:15,250 --> 00:28:19,584
or Windows, Linux, Android, Wii

459
00:28:24,334 --> 00:28:29,959
Part of the side affect is you said wait,

460
00:28:29,959 --> 00:28:32,584
how do you hold that?

461
00:28:32,584 --> 00:28:34,626
I don't.

462
00:28:34,626 --> 00:28:38,209
That's why we have the servers,

463
00:28:38,209 --> 00:28:42,999
run it on an iPad and don't have

464
00:28:42,999 --> 00:28:46,459
They talk to each other

465
00:28:46,459 --> 00:28:50,999
over unencrypted HCPD (Laughter.)

466
00:28:50,999 --> 00:28:53,999
and see this take place.

467
00:28:55,501 --> 00:28:59,083
Before we do that we have test

468
00:28:59,083 --> 00:29:01,626
how we're all terrified?

469
00:29:01,626 --> 00:29:04,709
If you're not terrified you're not paying

470
00:29:04,709 --> 00:29:07,999
on everybody in the city, which I hate.

471
00:29:07,999 --> 00:29:13,459
This doesn't mean we can't do valid

472
00:29:13,459 --> 00:29:19,083
to see me so you are going to see

473
00:29:19,083 --> 00:29:24,167
in different places and I have tested

474
00:29:24,167 --> 00:29:30,709
of nodes and it works incredibly well

475
00:29:30,709 --> 00:29:32,584
So we never collected any random

476
00:29:32,584 --> 00:29:35,334
because even though it's apparently

477
00:29:35,334 --> 00:29:37,626
of anything anymore

478
00:29:37,626 --> 00:29:39,751
down the third circuit.

479
00:29:44,083 --> 00:29:49,918
Let's watch it, Unity, it's not running

480
00:29:49,999 --> 00:29:51,250
Is it running?

481
00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:52,334
You are going to see a few things

482
00:29:52,334 --> 00:29:54,375
to see them exactly in time.

483
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:59,167
First you will see the dot move

484
00:29:59,167 --> 00:30:04,417
load, and I will zoom in and out,

485
00:30:04,417 --> 00:30:08,250
and it zooms the data and the map in.

486
00:30:08,375 --> 00:30:11,125
You can hover over nodes,

487
00:30:11,125 --> 00:30:13,792
or how many are in a room

488
00:30:13,792 --> 00:30:16,250
and they're Mac addresses.

489
00:30:16,250 --> 00:30:18,083
At the end,

490
00:30:18,083 --> 00:30:22,125
click on one node and then you see

491
00:30:22,501 --> 00:30:25,999
(Applause.) See,

492
00:30:25,999 --> 00:30:30,999
from a Google feed it's not Google

493
00:30:30,999 --> 00:30:36,626
from an online dating sight whose

494
00:30:36,626 --> 00:30:40,542
because I've heard

495
00:30:40,542 --> 00:30:45,667
even though they haven't heard

496
00:30:51,751 --> 00:30:55,626
You can see that they used log

497
00:30:55,626 --> 00:31:00,626
for every screen sharing site

498
00:31:00,626 --> 00:31:02,083
We have

499
00:31:02,083 --> 00:31:05,209
in the clear exactly what location

500
00:31:05,209 --> 00:31:09,626
is so I can make sure my sensors are

501
00:31:09,626 --> 00:31:12,918
calibrate my own network it's awesome.

502
00:31:13,792 --> 00:31:15,999
Let's talk about future work.

503
00:31:16,542 --> 00:31:20,709
What other applications can we do

504
00:31:20,751 --> 00:31:23,667
Well, one,

505
00:31:23,834 --> 00:31:26,083
Those of you who participated

506
00:31:26,083 --> 00:31:29,125
about "Occupy Wall Street"

507
00:31:29,125 --> 00:31:31,334
movements, have noticed a lot

508
00:31:31,334 --> 00:31:35,083
a mysterious stranger slips

509
00:31:35,083 --> 00:31:38,083
and the mysterious stranger is gone.

510
00:31:38,167 --> 00:31:39,959
It's amazing how this works.

511
00:31:40,334 --> 00:31:43,999
You can use counter infiltration though,

512
00:31:43,999 --> 00:31:45,918
hey, if anybody new shows

513
00:31:45,918 --> 00:31:48,083
scream "bloody murder" so when

514
00:31:48,083 --> 00:31:50,999
bloody murder" alarm goes off,

515
00:31:50,999 --> 00:31:52,959
with the Blackberry.

516
00:31:53,083 --> 00:31:54,083
He's the Fed.

517
00:31:54,999 --> 00:32:03,417
(Laughter.) (Applause.) You can also

518
00:32:03,417 --> 00:32:08,667
for operational securities training.

519
00:32:08,999 --> 00:32:11,209
You can say if I throw this

520
00:32:11,209 --> 00:32:14,918
for devices that I know my agents are

521
00:32:14,918 --> 00:32:16,584
they leaking?

522
00:32:16,584 --> 00:32:17,999
How terrified should I be?

523
00:32:17,999 --> 00:32:19,792
Here's a hint: Really terrified.

524
00:32:20,250 --> 00:32:23,584
You don't need

525
00:32:23,584 --> 00:32:25,999
If you are a huge corporation

526
00:32:25,999 --> 00:32:28,125
who wants

527
00:32:28,125 --> 00:32:30,459
home

528
00:32:30,459 --> 00:32:33,876
spread these over the town where

529
00:32:34,167 --> 00:32:36,250
Every time one of them connects

530
00:32:36,250 --> 00:32:39,083
to send your trade secrets

531
00:32:39,083 --> 00:32:41,542
will know it, so we

532
00:32:41,542 --> 00:32:44,999
through the complete and total invasion

533
00:32:45,876 --> 00:32:48,709
(Laughter.) This is the trade

534
00:32:48,709 --> 00:32:50,999
with and I'm not sure why.

535
00:32:51,083 --> 00:32:53,999
We have accepted that we have no

536
00:32:53,999 --> 00:32:55,999
that our devices are going

537
00:32:55,999 --> 00:32:59,876
to leak increasing amounts of data,

538
00:32:59,876 --> 00:33:03,250
on CNN and say "I don't know why

539
00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:04,999
Here is why.

540
00:33:06,209 --> 00:33:10,417
I don't want you going

541
00:33:10,417 --> 00:33:13,375
doesn't know not

542
00:33:13,375 --> 00:33:16,834
on your wife

543
00:33:16,834 --> 00:33:21,375
let's say I live 6 blocks

544
00:33:21,375 --> 00:33:24,667
around that,

545
00:33:24,667 --> 00:33:27,334
to do something wrong,

546
00:33:27,334 --> 00:33:32,584
to do something wrong and I get maybe

547
00:33:32,709 --> 00:33:36,125
People have been doing this

548
00:33:38,209 --> 00:33:40,083
Here is the difference.

549
00:33:40,083 --> 00:33:43,083
I would have to pay a whole team

550
00:33:43,083 --> 00:33:47,417
to watch senator so and so

551
00:33:50,999 --> 00:33:54,584
So for the cost

552
00:33:54,584 --> 00:33:59,501
in Vegas I can throw 10 or if we want

553
00:33:59,501 --> 00:34:03,834
the person with a weak wallet,

554
00:34:03,834 --> 00:34:07,999
they don't want everyone in the world

555
00:34:12,709 --> 00:34:16,083
Except for Anthony Wiener

556
00:34:16,083 --> 00:34:19,918
and rallies, there is a problem

557
00:34:19,918 --> 00:34:22,626
of evidence during crack downs.

558
00:34:22,626 --> 00:34:25,459
It's hard to know who was

559
00:34:25,459 --> 00:34:28,459
in and take you off, it's hard

560
00:34:28,459 --> 00:34:31,083
they should save in the jails.

561
00:34:33,709 --> 00:34:38,751
You can have it scan your friends

562
00:34:38,751 --> 00:34:43,999
you're offloading your data so that you

563
00:34:43,999 --> 00:34:47,125
which maybe

564
00:34:47,125 --> 00:34:50,167
in jail than they need

565
00:34:50,167 --> 00:34:53,999
an adversary knows what this

566
00:34:53,999 --> 00:34:59,334
they're probably going to unplug it

567
00:34:59,334 --> 00:35:04,792
to happen how to use it doing

568
00:35:04,792 --> 00:35:09,334
on random protesters, even

569
00:35:09,334 --> 00:35:13,834
a kid for walking while drunk which

570
00:35:13,834 --> 00:35:17,209
in college" we're safe

571
00:35:17,209 --> 00:35:23,083
for a long time and that means we get

572
00:35:23,626 --> 00:35:26,334
Let's talk about improvements.

573
00:35:26,334 --> 00:35:29,501
We can scale up,

574
00:35:29,501 --> 00:35:33,751
and because they're not connected

575
00:35:33,751 --> 00:35:39,792
but over the local coffee shop's wifi we

576
00:35:39,792 --> 00:35:44,999
and have five or six overlaid networks

577
00:35:44,999 --> 00:35:48,918
to each other

578
00:35:48,918 --> 00:35:53,999
can do geographical distribution

579
00:35:53,999 --> 00:35:58,999
to delete it off fast enough,

580
00:35:58,999 --> 00:36:01,209
up the networks.

581
00:36:01,209 --> 00:36:03,751
Each network then has one data sig

582
00:36:03,751 --> 00:36:05,999
all into the visualization.

583
00:36:05,999 --> 00:36:07,999
Visualization is good to a couple

584
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:09,999
if you've got better RAM.

585
00:36:09,999 --> 00:36:12,292
As I mentioned, scaling

586
00:36:12,292 --> 00:36:14,334
especially because there

587
00:36:14,334 --> 00:36:17,334
for Shark that lets you run

588
00:36:17,959 --> 00:36:20,834
This means that, yes,

589
00:36:20,834 --> 00:36:23,167
It's from the cloud so it must be here

590
00:36:23,167 --> 00:36:28,999
(Laughter.) There is other servers,

591
00:36:31,999 --> 00:36:35,083
The visualization is harder

592
00:36:35,083 --> 00:36:37,999
to how many nodes

593
00:36:37,999 --> 00:36:40,876
simultaneously

594
00:36:40,876 --> 00:36:44,375
of books by game developers

595
00:36:44,375 --> 00:36:48,209
they don't check your cred

596
00:36:50,918 --> 00:36:55,834
If you saw the black nodes versus white

597
00:36:55,834 --> 00:36:59,918
nodes but they also do limited distance

598
00:36:59,918 --> 00:37:03,918
in every FPS game you can't see

599
00:37:03,918 --> 00:37:08,667
this allows us to scale visualization

600
00:37:08,667 --> 00:37:12,667
goes everywhere in the world

601
00:37:12,667 --> 00:37:15,999
for 10, 20, $50,000,

602
00:37:15,999 --> 00:37:18,999
is not that big of an investment.

603
00:37:18,999 --> 00:37:20,999
Won't someone think of the children?

604
00:37:21,250 --> 00:37:25,501
(Laughter.) And everything they're

605
00:37:27,292 --> 00:37:30,751
(Laughter.) If you are, you're

606
00:37:31,999 --> 00:37:36,083
(Laughter.) Finally, we can add a lot

607
00:37:36,083 --> 00:37:36,876
How many

608
00:37:36,876 --> 00:37:40,209
with software to find radio

609
00:37:40,709 --> 00:37:41,999
Quite a few people.

610
00:37:43,083 --> 00:37:47,667
There are $10

611
00:37:47,667 --> 00:37:54,083
to find software defined radio

612
00:37:54,083 --> 00:38:00,167
of gigahertz for not a lot

613
00:38:00,167 --> 00:38:06,667
to anything, stalk the Goons for fun

614
00:38:06,667 --> 00:38:15,751
with restaurant pagers or anything else

615
00:38:16,501 --> 00:38:19,459
We can work

616
00:38:19,459 --> 00:38:22,751
to do with tools like Refer

617
00:38:22,751 --> 00:38:26,792
on wireless security and at the end

618
00:38:26,792 --> 00:38:31,999
in a city you don't really need it

619
00:38:32,167 --> 00:38:35,999
We could do active attacks

620
00:38:35,999 --> 00:38:40,751
to make sure devices connect to us

621
00:38:40,876 --> 00:38:43,626
We don't have to, and

622
00:38:43,626 --> 00:38:48,918
a weird address and you're A 6,000

623
00:38:48,918 --> 00:38:51,999
you're connected to,

624
00:38:51,999 --> 00:38:54,876
and then be more subtle.

625
00:38:58,167 --> 00:38:59,792
Finally, mitigation.

626
00:39:00,334 --> 00:39:04,876
The problem is we have to sacrifice

627
00:39:04,876 --> 00:39:09,292
to mitigate this (Laughter.) Yes,

628
00:39:09,834 --> 00:39:14,626
The leaks are at every level

629
00:39:14,626 --> 00:39:16,083
I do mean every, single level.

630
00:39:16,083 --> 00:39:19,334
The bottom layer,

631
00:39:19,334 --> 00:39:24,542
of networks is an acceptable way

632
00:39:24,542 --> 00:39:27,918
that's a terrible idea, right?

633
00:39:27,918 --> 00:39:29,584
That's in the protocol,

634
00:39:29,584 --> 00:39:32,999
the protocol that would be

635
00:39:32,999 --> 00:39:35,999
out engineering thugs to hurt us!

636
00:39:36,584 --> 00:39:39,999
They have to fix this

637
00:39:39,999 --> 00:39:43,083
convenient to walk

638
00:39:43,083 --> 00:39:47,083
to wifi without every having to turn

639
00:39:47,083 --> 00:39:50,626
to iMessage and download them

640
00:39:50,626 --> 00:39:53,999
from Anthony Wiener, I'm sure

641
00:39:53,999 --> 00:39:58,584
to be promulgate a few protocol

642
00:39:58,584 --> 00:40:02,876
Hey it's going to be less convenient

643
00:40:02,876 --> 00:40:07,999
but you should use this

644
00:40:08,626 --> 00:40:11,501
There is also a problem

645
00:40:11,792 --> 00:40:15,209
A lot of mobile operating systems,

646
00:40:15,209 --> 00:40:18,000
because that's what I use,

647
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,876
so when I connect to get a new wifi

648
00:40:21,876 --> 00:40:25,334
on the VPN

649
00:40:25,334 --> 00:40:27,999
That is not possible to do on ios.

650
00:40:28,999 --> 00:40:32,334
You always have those first few

651
00:40:32,334 --> 00:40:35,083
with data

652
00:40:35,083 --> 00:40:39,999
and they're transmitting everything else

653
00:40:41,375 --> 00:40:44,167
To the o/s 2 has to be protected.

654
00:40:50,042 --> 00:40:58,000
I found an online shopping application

655
00:40:58,250 --> 00:41:00,417
It's not Groupon right?

656
00:41:00,417 --> 00:41:02,667
It's not something that involves my

657
00:41:02,667 --> 00:41:04,999
they can send me targeted ads.

658
00:41:09,083 --> 00:41:11,125
No one should have unencrypted

659
00:41:11,125 --> 00:41:14,334
to how much that new Manolo Blahnik

660
00:41:14,334 --> 00:41:17,999
but for some reason everyone

661
00:41:17,999 --> 00:41:22,542
access to what os I'm running where

662
00:41:22,542 --> 00:41:24,250
That's a pretty weird trade off.

663
00:41:24,250 --> 00:41:26,083
It's our fault,

664
00:41:26,083 --> 00:41:30,083
to protect our users,

665
00:41:30,250 --> 00:41:33,417
This is everyone's fault, so no one

666
00:41:33,417 --> 00:41:35,083
for us, right?

667
00:41:35,999 --> 00:41:39,083
It's just status quo, right?

668
00:41:39,209 --> 00:41:41,999
The status is not quo, for those

669
00:41:41,999 --> 00:41:45,876
Horrible: "We cannot tolerate this level

670
00:41:45,876 --> 00:41:47,459
Horrible fan!

671
00:41:47,626 --> 00:41:51,209
As consumers we need to do better

672
00:41:51,209 --> 00:41:53,999
to the world to do better.

673
00:41:54,417 --> 00:41:56,417
One final digression.

674
00:41:56,709 --> 00:41:59,999
At Smu Con 2013 there was

675
00:41:59,999 --> 00:42:03,125
about academics and researchers.

676
00:42:03,125 --> 00:42:05,250
I have split both in my career.

677
00:42:05,250 --> 00:42:07,334
I have an academic degree

678
00:42:07,334 --> 00:42:10,167
an academic degree in law these days,

679
00:42:10,167 --> 00:42:13,417
without any academic support most

680
00:42:13,709 --> 00:42:16,167
We need to be able to have a way

681
00:42:16,167 --> 00:42:19,751
to work together, and part

682
00:42:19,751 --> 00:42:21,999
to find a way, any way

683
00:42:21,999 --> 00:42:24,667
the same mistakes over and over.

684
00:42:24,709 --> 00:42:26,501
Everybody who has done

685
00:42:26,501 --> 00:42:28,250
project knows that you spend

686
00:42:28,250 --> 00:42:30,334
of months you do something

687
00:42:30,334 --> 00:42:34,167
of months you say, oh, God,

688
00:42:34,709 --> 00:42:38,209
Couple days ago,

689
00:42:38,209 --> 00:42:42,959
a new hacker archive that you can

690
00:42:43,334 --> 00:42:46,999
Tweets, blog post,

691
00:42:46,999 --> 00:42:49,459
We will have mentors that

692
00:42:49,459 --> 00:42:52,834
to the next level, or the next level

693
00:42:52,834 --> 00:42:56,834
the next "Woot Conference" which

694
00:42:57,999 --> 00:43:00,667
We want to be able to promote

695
00:43:00,667 --> 00:43:04,542
to have a permanent archive so people

696
00:43:04,542 --> 00:43:07,125
it will live beyond their own time,

697
00:43:07,125 --> 00:43:11,751
if we start losing hackers left and right,

698
00:43:12,083 --> 00:43:13,751
We need to "fail" better.

699
00:43:13,834 --> 00:43:15,834
In order to do that, we need your help.

700
00:43:15,834 --> 00:43:17,083
It's at HARK.net.

701
00:43:17,083 --> 00:43:19,125
where you can contribute to.

702
00:43:19,709 --> 00:43:22,167
Finally to those who have asked

703
00:43:22,167 --> 00:43:24,876
the CFT and for my law school

704
00:43:24,876 --> 00:43:27,999
to make me work on law school most

705
00:43:28,792 --> 00:43:31,792
And I'm finishing law school

706
00:43:32,792 --> 00:43:36,667
If you have an idea that you would

707
00:43:36,667 --> 00:43:39,125
an email, it's on the slide.

708
00:43:39,167 --> 00:43:41,999
Seriously, we want to be able

709
00:43:41,999 --> 00:43:44,999
not just academics' work, live forever.

710
00:43:44,999 --> 00:43:49,209
If you want to live in immortality, go

711
00:43:49,209 --> 00:43:50,209
Thanks very much.

712
00:43:50,209 --> 00:43:59,501
(Applause.) I have two minutes

713
00:44:00,999 --> 00:44:06,999
AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Away

714
00:44:06,999 --> 00:44:09,083
IP cameras?

715
00:44:09,083 --> 00:44:12,792
You could do that that's

716
00:44:13,999 --> 00:44:15,792
Repeat the question?

717
00:44:16,083 --> 00:44:19,999
The question was why don't I integrate

718
00:44:19,999 --> 00:44:22,083
and stalk from that.

719
00:44:22,083 --> 00:44:25,125
That would work you need

720
00:44:25,125 --> 00:44:28,083
of the O parsers,

721
00:44:28,083 --> 00:44:31,709
into the device which would be cool

722
00:44:31,709 --> 00:44:34,501
to bring a Raspberry Pi aboard.

723
00:44:34,834 --> 00:44:39,999
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Have you

724
00:44:39,999 --> 00:44:50,999
about using Unity ID (Away

725
00:44:50,999 --> 00:44:53,209
So the question was have I used Unity's

726
00:44:53,209 --> 00:44:56,417
the networking

727
00:44:56,417 --> 00:44:59,792
I haven't, because it's not flexible

728
00:44:59,792 --> 00:45:02,999
the way to do that would be to go

729
00:45:02,999 --> 00:45:05,709
by everybody dumping

730
00:45:05,709 --> 00:45:07,292
and tagging.

731
00:45:08,959 --> 00:45:13,709
So that capability is built in,

732
00:45:13,959 --> 00:45:15,334
Everybody else grab me,

733
00:45:15,334 --> 00:45:17,501
off stage in about 30 seconds.

734
00:45:17,501 --> 00:45:18,501
Thanks very much.
