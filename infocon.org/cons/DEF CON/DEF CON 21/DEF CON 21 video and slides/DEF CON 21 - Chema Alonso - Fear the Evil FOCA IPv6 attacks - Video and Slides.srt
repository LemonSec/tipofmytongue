1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,250
CHEMA ALONSO: Hello.

2
00:00:01,250 --> 00:00:02,501
Good morning, hackers.

3
00:00:02,501 --> 00:00:04,999
(Cheers.)    CHEMA ALONSO: Hello, everybody.

4
00:00:04,999 --> 00:00:06,125
Good morning, everybody.

5
00:00:06,125 --> 00:00:06,125
Thank you to coming to the session

6
00:00:06,125 --> 00:00:07,834
about attacking IPv4 network.

7
00:00:07,999 --> 00:00:10,667
I'm Chema Alonso from Spain.

8
00:00:10,999 --> 00:00:15,999
This is the sixth occasion that I'm speaking here at DEF CON.

9
00:00:15,999 --> 00:00:19,834
Year after year before delivering the talk, I have been trying

10
00:00:19,834 --> 00:00:23,667
to convince you to come to my country.

11
00:00:23,959 --> 00:00:28,167
How many of you have been to Spain in the last six years, please?

12
00:00:28,167 --> 00:00:29,167
Hands up?

13
00:00:29,417 --> 00:00:30,417
Very well!

14
00:00:30,834 --> 00:00:32,167
Did you enjoy Spain?

15
00:00:32,417 --> 00:00:36,626
(Cheers.)    CHEMA ALONSO: For the rest of you I have been convincing

16
00:00:36,626 --> 00:00:40,667
you year after year, talking about the beaches, the parties,

17
00:00:40,667 --> 00:00:44,999
the beaches, the parties, the bullfighters, so on.

18
00:00:44,999 --> 00:00:48,584
This time I'm going to try a different approach.

19
00:00:48,584 --> 00:00:52,584
I try to convince you to visit my country by doing

20
00:00:52,584 --> 00:00:55,250
a history of Spain.

21
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:57,999
History of Spain in only one minute.

22
00:00:57,999 --> 00:00:58,999
Is okay for you?

23
00:00:58,999 --> 00:01:01,876
(Cheers and applause.)    CHEMA ALONSO:

24
00:01:01,876 --> 00:01:08,125
Well, 2000 years ago -- (Laughter.)    CHEMA ALONSO: Spain was

25
00:01:08,125 --> 00:01:10,918
a Roman country.

26
00:01:11,083 --> 00:01:13,876
In fact, we have some of the best Roman Emperors,

27
00:01:13,876 --> 00:01:17,375
like Vispasian and Trajan, born in Spain.

28
00:01:18,167 --> 00:01:22,999
And if you visit Spain you can discover in the middle of the city a lot

29
00:01:22,999 --> 00:01:27,876
of Roman monuments like this in Segovia and this in Merida.

30
00:01:27,876 --> 00:01:31,918
All of the country is full of these monuments.

31
00:01:32,083 --> 00:01:36,375
Centuries after, Spain was a medieval country.

32
00:01:36,375 --> 00:01:40,999
If you visit the country you find a lot of castles.

33
00:01:41,834 --> 00:01:44,792
There are hundreds and hundreds of castles.

34
00:01:44,999 --> 00:01:46,667
You can visit all of them.

35
00:01:46,667 --> 00:01:48,667
Even you can buy it if you have enough money

36
00:01:48,667 --> 00:01:51,918
because some of them are for sale.

37
00:01:51,918 --> 00:01:53,501
It is true; it is not a joke.

38
00:01:53,667 --> 00:01:58,292
After that, Spain was an Arabic country, seven centuries being

39
00:01:58,292 --> 00:02:00,751
an Arabic country.

40
00:02:00,751 --> 00:02:03,999
If you visit Spain you will discover that there are a lot

41
00:02:03,999 --> 00:02:07,542
of mosques around the country, with beautiful monuments

42
00:02:07,542 --> 00:02:09,876
in all the country.

43
00:02:10,083 --> 00:02:13,375
After that, Spain was an empire.

44
00:02:13,417 --> 00:02:14,792
Probably you know it.

45
00:02:15,083 --> 00:02:19,918
And like Spain was an empire, all great artists wanted to work

46
00:02:19,918 --> 00:02:21,999
for the empire.

47
00:02:21,999 --> 00:02:24,167
So in Spain there are a lot of museums

48
00:02:24,167 --> 00:02:28,584
with great artists' paintings like this.

49
00:02:28,709 --> 00:02:31,542
So are you going to visit Spain, please?

50
00:02:31,542 --> 00:02:33,709
(Cheers and applause.)    CHEMA ALONSO:

51
00:02:33,709 --> 00:02:38,083
Well, we are not an empire anymore, as you know.

52
00:02:38,667 --> 00:02:40,167
Let's talk about FOCA.

53
00:02:40,167 --> 00:02:41,709
How many of you know FOCA?

54
00:02:41,999 --> 00:02:44,125
How many of you love FOCA?

55
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:48,292
Today I'm going to talk about another FOCA.

56
00:02:48,292 --> 00:02:50,417
It is not the FOCA that you probably know.

57
00:02:52,292 --> 00:02:55,999
It is a FOCA based on hacking networks.

58
00:02:55,999 --> 00:02:58,667
The idea of this tool is that probably most of the users,

59
00:02:58,667 --> 00:03:02,918
any time in their life had tried a very dangerous command in their,

60
00:03:02,918 --> 00:03:04,459
IP config.

61
00:03:07,209 --> 00:03:12,292
It is very dangerous and difficult to understand this command.

62
00:03:12,292 --> 00:03:15,209
As you can see, in Spain, because Spain is better ...

63
00:03:15,209 --> 00:03:18,834
(Laughter.)    CHEMA ALONSO: And as you can see, there

64
00:03:18,834 --> 00:03:22,792
is a special magic in the result that you can see

65
00:03:22,792 --> 00:03:26,999
because if you ask to any user that type this command

66
00:03:26,999 --> 00:03:32,083
what is the IP address, all users are going to say 192.106A.1,

67
00:03:32,083 --> 00:03:33,584
so on.

68
00:03:35,334 --> 00:03:40,501
Nobody can see the IP address on top of their list.

69
00:03:41,834 --> 00:03:43,999
Have you seen that IP address?

70
00:03:44,083 --> 00:03:45,083
The victim?

71
00:03:45,083 --> 00:03:46,083
Yeah?

72
00:03:46,083 --> 00:03:49,999
Most of you when realize that there is something on top of the IP address,

73
00:03:49,999 --> 00:03:52,334
do something like this.

74
00:03:52,584 --> 00:03:55,876
(Laughter.)    CHEMA ALONSO: Well, the truth is that

75
00:03:55,876 --> 00:04:00,334
in all Windows operating systems, IPv6 is working by results, it

76
00:04:00,334 --> 00:04:02,250
is turned on.

77
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:05,334
So you go to test your network configuration,

78
00:04:05,334 --> 00:04:09,999
you can realize that IPv6 is turning on and by default

79
00:04:09,999 --> 00:04:12,999
is configured like this.

80
00:04:13,083 --> 00:04:15,542
It is in Spain, you know about it?

81
00:04:15,999 --> 00:04:19,459
That means automatically configuration.

82
00:04:20,375 --> 00:04:27,918
That means that IPv6 is waiting to be configured to run on the machine.

83
00:04:27,918 --> 00:04:28,918
But it is working.

84
00:04:28,918 --> 00:04:32,083
And if you test the roting table you can realize that you

85
00:04:32,083 --> 00:04:36,792
have all the roll team table for IPv6 installed in your computer

86
00:04:36,792 --> 00:04:39,918
and even one of the most dangerous commands,

87
00:04:39,918 --> 00:04:41,459
the ping.

88
00:04:41,999 --> 00:04:43,125
Ping is working.

89
00:04:43,667 --> 00:04:46,459
So I'm going to do a demo, an easy one.

90
00:04:46,792 --> 00:04:48,667
I've got two machines.

91
00:04:48,709 --> 00:04:51,417
One of those is this blue.

92
00:04:51,417 --> 00:04:52,792
The blue is the server.

93
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:57,501
And as you can see we have an IPv6 address and an IPv4.

94
00:04:58,584 --> 00:05:02,918
The IPv6 is FA -- whatever.

95
00:05:02,999 --> 00:05:08,083
And the IPv4 is 192, 168, ten, one.

96
00:05:08,083 --> 00:05:12,918
If we go to the client to the other machine, which

97
00:05:12,918 --> 00:05:21,999
is the red one and try to do a ping to the IP before -- to the IPv4, 100 what?

98
00:05:24,834 --> 00:05:28,209
192.168.10.1, it is working.

99
00:05:28,375 --> 00:05:32,083
We try to discover what is the name of this server?

100
00:05:32,083 --> 00:05:35,209
We got that the name is share.

101
00:05:35,292 --> 00:05:42,709
If we try the IPv6 address, of course it is working as well.

102
00:05:42,709 --> 00:05:48,459
If we do something like ping, the name, then magic occurs

103
00:05:48,459 --> 00:05:55,626
because by default Windows tried to connect using IPv6.

104
00:05:55,626 --> 00:05:58,250
But probably all of you are aware of this.

105
00:05:58,250 --> 00:05:59,250
This is true?

106
00:05:59,751 --> 00:06:00,751
Yeah.

107
00:06:00,751 --> 00:06:03,792
And you are taking care of IPv6 attacks for sure.

108
00:06:04,083 --> 00:06:11,083
(Laughter.)    CHEMA ALONSO: Well, this said, the idea of IPv6 is that

109
00:06:11,083 --> 00:06:16,083
in Windows machine, both protocols are working

110
00:06:16,083 --> 00:06:18,999
at the same time.

111
00:06:18,999 --> 00:06:21,375
Depending on the configuration of your network, the machine

112
00:06:21,375 --> 00:06:23,999
is going to use IPv4 or IPv6.

113
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:26,375
If you have an IPv4 network fully configure rated

114
00:06:26,375 --> 00:06:29,125
with the main controller, with the DNS and

115
00:06:29,125 --> 00:06:33,999
all the computers are in the DNS and all of them working with the IPv4,

116
00:06:33,999 --> 00:06:39,167
then the New York is going to work as an IPv4 network by default.

117
00:06:39,167 --> 00:06:41,167
But if you are in a local network connected

118
00:06:41,167 --> 00:06:44,834
with other computers from different parts, they are not

119
00:06:44,834 --> 00:06:46,876
in the same DNS.

120
00:06:46,876 --> 00:06:49,083
They are not in the same domain controller,

121
00:06:49,083 --> 00:06:52,999
then IPv6 will appear a lot of times.

122
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:59,501
This is due because in Windows Vista, Microsoft added this protocol,

123
00:06:59,501 --> 00:07:02,999
local eManager which is a protocol that tries

124
00:07:02,999 --> 00:07:09,083
to discover what is the IP address of a computer in the network.

125
00:07:09,083 --> 00:07:12,501
It is working only in the local network, in the local segment.

126
00:07:12,501 --> 00:07:15,999
As you can see it is trying to discover the IP address

127
00:07:15,999 --> 00:07:19,459
of the computer for any protocol.

128
00:07:19,459 --> 00:07:23,999
So it is trying to query the DNS as a router is trying to --

129
00:07:23,999 --> 00:07:30,959
the IPv6 network is trying to do a broadcasting discovery -- sorry.

130
00:07:35,083 --> 00:07:36,459
Whatever.

131
00:07:36,459 --> 00:07:38,999
In the end, when local eManager discovered

132
00:07:38,999 --> 00:07:45,250
the IP address of the destination server, it is possible to connect using IPv6,

133
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:49,375
then it is going to connect using IPv6.

134
00:07:50,083 --> 00:07:53,959
Once we have the IP address, we need the physical address

135
00:07:53,959 --> 00:07:58,083
to discover the physical address in IPv4 we are using ARP, but ARP

136
00:07:58,083 --> 00:08:01,083
is not working in IPv6 anymore.

137
00:08:01,083 --> 00:08:05,709
If you have a security solution to detect attacking with ARP, it

138
00:08:05,709 --> 00:08:09,209
is good for IPv4 but not IPv6.

139
00:08:09,542 --> 00:08:14,999
We are using a different protocol, which is a neighbor discovery protocol

140
00:08:14,999 --> 00:08:19,083
based on two different, they are neighbor solicitation and

141
00:08:19,083 --> 00:08:22,959
in the end neighbor solicitation and -- are working

142
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:27,083
in the same way that ARP, but it is not ARP.

143
00:08:27,083 --> 00:08:29,375
That is important.

144
00:08:29,459 --> 00:08:32,334
We got a table also in which we connect

145
00:08:32,334 --> 00:08:36,542
the IPv6 address with the physical address.

146
00:08:36,999 --> 00:08:39,999
In IPv4, it is the ARP table.

147
00:08:39,999 --> 00:08:41,999
In IPv6 it is the neighbor table.

148
00:08:41,999 --> 00:08:42,999
It is in your computer.

149
00:08:43,083 --> 00:08:47,999
You can query the table using that command.

150
00:08:48,999 --> 00:08:53,501
This said, how it works is like this.

151
00:08:53,501 --> 00:08:56,999
Someone is trying to discover the physical address

152
00:08:56,999 --> 00:08:59,667
of an IPv6 computer.

153
00:08:59,667 --> 00:09:05,417
Then send messages to FF auto, which is multicast address.

154
00:09:05,834 --> 00:09:10,459
Querying for the IPv6 address in which it is interested.

155
00:09:10,459 --> 00:09:12,417
In this case, this one.

156
00:09:12,417 --> 00:09:14,999
The computer with this IPv6 address and

157
00:09:14,999 --> 00:09:21,334
in this case this one, is going to answer with the physical address.

158
00:09:21,334 --> 00:09:22,959
It is very easy to understand.

159
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:23,959
It is the same done.

160
00:09:24,626 --> 00:09:30,375
That means perform -- this environment is very easy.

161
00:09:30,375 --> 00:09:34,375
We only need to send two packets, like ARP, it is very easy.

162
00:09:34,999 --> 00:09:40,083
We need to send a packet to one of the computers, spoofing

163
00:09:40,083 --> 00:09:44,626
the IPv6 address of the other and then do the same

164
00:09:44,626 --> 00:09:47,709
with the other machine.

165
00:09:47,709 --> 00:09:50,959
Only two packets and we have the man in the middle like in ARP.

166
00:09:51,083 --> 00:09:54,417
Let's do a quick and easy demo, Level 1.

167
00:09:54,542 --> 00:09:58,626
Very easy to understand in this environment.

168
00:09:58,626 --> 00:10:01,000
But before doing it, you don't have to take

169
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,999
into account that we are Spanish.

170
00:10:04,083 --> 00:10:05,417
So we are lazy.

171
00:10:05,876 --> 00:10:11,042
(Laughter.)    CHEMA ALONSO: We need tools for work.

172
00:10:11,709 --> 00:10:14,751
So we created the Evil FOCA, okay?

173
00:10:14,999 --> 00:10:18,167
In this demo, we have three machines.

174
00:10:19,292 --> 00:10:22,999
The blue one is a server.

175
00:10:22,999 --> 00:10:27,959
The red one is the victim, is the client.

176
00:10:27,999 --> 00:10:30,083
The black one is the Evil FOCA.

177
00:10:30,375 --> 00:10:37,417
So we only need to do something like open Wireshark, open Evil FOCA,

178
00:10:37,417 --> 00:10:43,125
yes, then Evil FOCA discovered the network.

179
00:10:43,584 --> 00:10:44,584
Yes.

180
00:10:44,999 --> 00:10:47,876
Drag, drag, click.

181
00:10:48,667 --> 00:10:50,209
And that's all.

182
00:10:50,209 --> 00:10:51,209
Okay?

183
00:10:55,918 --> 00:11:01,083
(Applause.) (Cheers and applause.)    CHEMA ALONSO: So

184
00:11:01,083 --> 00:11:07,083
if we go to Wireshark, if we go to Wireshark in this machine,

185
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:13,250
we start to capture information, capture interfaces.

186
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:18,542
And we do something very easy.

187
00:11:18,542 --> 00:11:28,876
Go to the client and from the client to server, connect to the server.

188
00:11:28,876 --> 00:11:29,876
Open a document.

189
00:11:29,876 --> 00:11:31,459
With my pass wore.

190
00:11:31,459 --> 00:11:36,999
And then we go to the FOCA, the old FOCA.

191
00:11:36,999 --> 00:11:39,584
We only need to do follow this BS extreme

192
00:11:39,584 --> 00:11:41,751
and that's it.

193
00:11:41,751 --> 00:11:44,459
We got all the information and we define, to search

194
00:11:44,459 --> 00:11:47,751
for the password and here it is.

195
00:11:49,334 --> 00:11:50,751
Okay?

196
00:11:50,751 --> 00:11:51,999
Very easy to understand.

197
00:11:51,999 --> 00:11:58,626
(Applause.)    CHEMA ALONSO: Well, this is very easy.

198
00:11:58,626 --> 00:11:59,626
It's Level 1.

199
00:12:00,083 --> 00:12:05,083
I am going to stop the server.

200
00:12:05,083 --> 00:12:06,792
I don't need the server anymore.

201
00:12:06,876 --> 00:12:12,083
And now we are going to get into the Level 2.

202
00:12:12,083 --> 00:12:15,083
The idea of Level 2 is, okay, we have the IPv6 in the network,

203
00:12:15,083 --> 00:12:17,834
but I want to be a man in the middle when

204
00:12:17,834 --> 00:12:20,626
the bit thing connects to the Internet which

205
00:12:20,626 --> 00:12:22,918
is working on IPv4.

206
00:12:22,918 --> 00:12:23,999
That is the challenge.

207
00:12:24,083 --> 00:12:27,918
This is the demo that I did it, in case it didn't work.

208
00:12:27,999 --> 00:12:31,626
The second, in the second demo, it is a slack attack.

209
00:12:31,626 --> 00:12:35,209
Yesterday there was a talk, talking about this.

210
00:12:35,209 --> 00:12:37,209
We released this tool in March.

211
00:12:37,209 --> 00:12:39,876
Is public this tool in March when this attack.

212
00:12:39,876 --> 00:12:40,999
The idea is simple.

213
00:12:40,999 --> 00:12:45,918
In IPv6 there are a lot of computers, there are big IP address and it would be

214
00:12:45,918 --> 00:12:51,999
impossible for a system manager to manage all the roads on the network.

215
00:12:51,999 --> 00:12:58,501
I have 3,000 routers, and computers, it would be a mess.

216
00:12:58,542 --> 00:13:01,334
The idea from the beginning, you don't have to worry

217
00:13:01,334 --> 00:13:05,209
about the default guide way because we will create a protocol

218
00:13:05,209 --> 00:13:07,792
to figure the computer.

219
00:13:09,999 --> 00:13:13,999
This is the idea is quite simple.

220
00:13:13,999 --> 00:13:17,375
When a computer with IPv6 needs to connect to the Internet, ask

221
00:13:17,375 --> 00:13:22,792
for a router with a package called router solicitation and if there, if there

222
00:13:22,792 --> 00:13:27,876
is a router in the network, answer with the neighbor advertisement saying

223
00:13:27,876 --> 00:13:31,417
hey, here are router, here are friend.

224
00:13:31,876 --> 00:13:34,999
After that the computer configures automatically

225
00:13:34,999 --> 00:13:40,125
an IPv6 network that has connectivity with the router and configured

226
00:13:40,125 --> 00:13:43,834
the router as the fall guide way.

227
00:13:43,834 --> 00:13:45,876
Very easy to do and understand.

228
00:13:45,876 --> 00:13:48,459
That protocol configures the default guide way.

229
00:13:48,459 --> 00:13:49,459
But not the DNS.

230
00:13:49,999 --> 00:13:51,584
Not always.

231
00:13:51,667 --> 00:13:56,083
You can also a rogue DHCP to configure, but it

232
00:13:56,083 --> 00:14:01,083
is not necessarily because in Windows machines there

233
00:14:01,083 --> 00:14:07,334
is a special protocol which is the DNS auto discovery.

234
00:14:07,959 --> 00:14:12,209
If your computer doesn't have any DNS configured by default,

235
00:14:12,209 --> 00:14:15,876
you use these three IP address.

236
00:14:15,876 --> 00:14:19,167
That means that if someone configures that IP address

237
00:14:19,167 --> 00:14:24,626
in your network, it will be the DNS in your network.

238
00:14:24,626 --> 00:14:26,999
You need to take care of this IP address.

239
00:14:26,999 --> 00:14:29,167
So to do the attack is very easy

240
00:14:29,167 --> 00:14:34,751
because all Web browsers are ready to work with IPv6.

241
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:38,999
This is the procedure which is really for IPv6.

242
00:14:38,999 --> 00:14:43,334
In Google Chrome is activated, IPv6 is activated by default.

243
00:14:45,999 --> 00:14:49,959
If the guy is using Google Chrome, you cannot do this attack.

244
00:14:49,959 --> 00:14:50,999
You can do the next one.

245
00:14:50,999 --> 00:14:51,999
Don't worry.

246
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:55,959
(Chuckles.)    CHEMA ALONSO: There are several situations

247
00:14:55,959 --> 00:14:58,918
in which IPv6 attacks are not working very well

248
00:14:58,918 --> 00:15:02,501
because Windows have very special behavior.

249
00:15:02,501 --> 00:15:07,375
If you have IPv4 and IPv6 fully configured with the DNS and

250
00:15:07,375 --> 00:15:10,999
the default gateway, then Windows used

251
00:15:10,999 --> 00:15:15,667
the DNS configured in the IPv4 protocol.

252
00:15:15,667 --> 00:15:19,751
It makes sense because in the end, DNS is supposed to be only one copy

253
00:15:19,751 --> 00:15:22,209
in the whole Internet.

254
00:15:22,209 --> 00:15:27,167
So it doesn't matter in connecting to the DNS using IPv4 or IPv6.

255
00:15:27,167 --> 00:15:30,375
In Windows they choose to use IPv4 protocol to connect

256
00:15:30,375 --> 00:15:32,125
to the DNS.

257
00:15:32,459 --> 00:15:38,167
If you don't have IPv4 fully configured, if the DHCP is giving you

258
00:15:38,167 --> 00:15:43,459
the default gateway, if we configure IPv6, the computer

259
00:15:43,459 --> 00:15:46,959
is going to use the IPv6.

260
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:52,876
But in some cases by default it is searching for DNS record

261
00:15:52,876 --> 00:15:55,626
of IPv4 address.

262
00:15:56,501 --> 00:16:00,292
Than means that if we want to create a special man

263
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:04,584
in the middle using IPv6 between the client and the man

264
00:16:04,584 --> 00:16:08,209
in the middle we need to reconstruct the answers

265
00:16:08,209 --> 00:16:10,501
to IPv6 records.

266
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:19,125
And of course, if we got IPv6 than and IPv4 only in local link,

267
00:16:19,125 --> 00:16:22,959
sorry -- I am sick.

268
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:28,501
And if we have IPv6 and IPv4 with local link, the DNS is going

269
00:16:28,501 --> 00:16:35,999
to be using IPv6 and is going to be querying DNS of IPv6 address.

270
00:16:35,999 --> 00:16:39,751
But it is very easy to change the behavior

271
00:16:39,751 --> 00:16:46,501
because if the client asks for DNS query searching for an IPv4,

272
00:16:46,501 --> 00:16:53,334
you can respond with an IPv6 and everything goes well.

273
00:16:53,334 --> 00:16:54,417
So don't worry at all.

274
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:59,125
So what is Evil FOCA doing in this attack?

275
00:16:59,125 --> 00:17:00,417
The idea is quite simple.

276
00:17:00,417 --> 00:17:03,584
Evil FOCA is going to be this guy.

277
00:17:03,584 --> 00:17:08,083
Using network installation 624 and DNS624.

278
00:17:08,083 --> 00:17:11,501
The idea is we are going to configure -- Ooooo!

279
00:17:14,584 --> 00:17:18,417
We are going to configure this, configure the slack attack

280
00:17:18,417 --> 00:17:21,667
to configure the default gateway.

281
00:17:23,999 --> 00:17:27,999
It automatically is going to configure the DNS how to discover

282
00:17:27,999 --> 00:17:32,999
to connect to the Internet and DNS how to discover is IPv6.

283
00:17:32,999 --> 00:17:33,999
So we are in the middle.

284
00:17:33,999 --> 00:17:36,999
We are going to capture all DNS queries.

285
00:17:37,334 --> 00:17:41,501
So when he asks for an IPv4 URL, for example,

286
00:17:41,501 --> 00:17:47,501
www.DEFCON.org which is only working IPv4, then that query

287
00:17:47,501 --> 00:17:52,999
is going to be sent to the default gateway.

288
00:17:52,999 --> 00:17:54,918
We are going to intercept the query.

289
00:17:55,125 --> 00:17:59,250
We are going to ask for the real IPv4 on the Internet.

290
00:18:00,083 --> 00:18:04,459
Then we are going to compare the IPv4 to an IPv6 address and give

291
00:18:04,459 --> 00:18:08,999
the IPv6 address to the client and then the client is going to send

292
00:18:08,999 --> 00:18:12,584
the IPv6 query to the default gateway and we are going

293
00:18:12,584 --> 00:18:17,250
to translate the IPv6 to IPv4 and send to the server and get the answer

294
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:20,999
and then it is very easy to understand.

295
00:18:20,999 --> 00:18:23,999
(Cheers and laughter.)    CHEMA ALONSO: But

296
00:18:23,999 --> 00:18:26,999
you know, we are Spanish.

297
00:18:27,999 --> 00:18:30,125
So let's do the demo.

298
00:18:30,125 --> 00:18:32,083
The idea in the first demo, we only need to send two packets

299
00:18:32,083 --> 00:18:34,417
to make one follow the other.

300
00:18:34,501 --> 00:18:39,834
In this example we need to send the packet to configure the slack attack.

301
00:18:39,834 --> 00:18:42,999
Then we need to do all the translation.

302
00:18:42,999 --> 00:18:46,876
And in Evil FOCA, we need to do this.

303
00:18:46,876 --> 00:18:51,167
First of all, I am going to spend a lot of money using my Spanish mobile

304
00:18:51,167 --> 00:18:54,999
phone, but I need Internet connection.

305
00:18:57,959 --> 00:18:59,209
So connect.

306
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:03,751
Okay.

307
00:19:03,792 --> 00:19:07,999
Let's see if I have Internet connection.

308
00:19:14,584 --> 00:19:16,125
Please, please, please.

309
00:19:16,125 --> 00:19:17,959
Okay, I got Internet connection.

310
00:19:18,459 --> 00:19:21,999
Then I got the Evil FOCA.

311
00:19:24,083 --> 00:19:27,083
I got the Evil FOCA and the victim.

312
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:35,083
And I am going to do something like open Evil FOCA.

313
00:19:35,125 --> 00:19:37,083
I am going to the big thing.

314
00:19:37,375 --> 00:19:43,584
I'm going -- I'm going to the victim.

315
00:19:43,584 --> 00:19:46,083
I'm going to -- the network adapter in case something was to start

316
00:19:46,083 --> 00:19:48,209
from the previous demo.

317
00:19:48,334 --> 00:19:49,334
That's all.

318
00:19:49,834 --> 00:19:56,292
And all that we need to do is something like go to Evil FOCA.

319
00:19:56,292 --> 00:20:01,751
(Chuckles.)    CHEMA ALONSO: And then select slack.

320
00:20:01,751 --> 00:20:14,876
Just click here and start.

321
00:20:14,876 --> 00:20:15,876
That's ...

322
00:20:15,876 --> 00:20:16,876
That's all.

323
00:20:16,876 --> 00:20:18,834
(Applause.)    CHEMA ALONSO: If we try to do something like, this

324
00:20:18,834 --> 00:20:21,167
is in the host machine.

325
00:20:21,167 --> 00:20:22,876
This is the host machine.

326
00:20:22,876 --> 00:20:27,667
If I try to connect to the DNS and search

327
00:20:27,667 --> 00:20:36,542
for an IPv6 address for DEFCON.org, as you can see there is not

328
00:20:36,542 --> 00:20:46,250
an IPv6 address for DEFCON.org and if we go to the victim and we open

329
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:55,334
the Web browser, and we search for www.google.com or DEFCON.org,

330
00:20:55,334 --> 00:20:59,501
everything is working.

331
00:21:01,083 --> 00:21:03,334
Google and DEF CON.

332
00:21:10,999 --> 00:21:16,667
And if we search for the IP address that we are using

333
00:21:16,667 --> 00:21:20,999
to connect, ping www.DEFCON.org.

334
00:21:22,959 --> 00:21:27,417
It is an IPv6 because we are changing the IPv4

335
00:21:27,417 --> 00:21:31,626
to IPv6 and as you can see we are browsing

336
00:21:31,626 --> 00:21:33,999
the Internet.

337
00:21:42,959 --> 00:21:48,834
(Applause.)    CHEMA ALONSO: Well, this is the demo, just in case.

338
00:21:48,999 --> 00:21:49,999
Level three.

339
00:21:50,125 --> 00:21:51,542
Well, this is Level 3.

340
00:21:51,667 --> 00:21:55,250
We are not published this version of Evil FOCA yet.

341
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:57,999
But next week you will have this version available.

342
00:21:57,999 --> 00:22:01,918
And the idea is to use the Web browser how

343
00:22:01,918 --> 00:22:05,959
to discover protocol in IPv6.

344
00:22:05,959 --> 00:22:07,083
The idea is quite simple.

345
00:22:08,083 --> 00:22:14,876
Automatic by default all Web browsers, Google Chrome, Internet Explorer,

346
00:22:14,876 --> 00:22:20,292
Mozilla 5.4 are searching for Web browsing, to discover what

347
00:22:20,292 --> 00:22:23,834
is the Web browser they are searching

348
00:22:23,834 --> 00:22:29,918
for in a special record in the DNS, which is Web browser discovery

349
00:22:29,918 --> 00:22:35,918
with WPAD and then connect to that IP address and that IP address

350
00:22:35,918 --> 00:22:41,918
is supposed to have a server and the server gives a special final

351
00:22:41,918 --> 00:22:48,459
and that special file gives the IP address of the Web server.

352
00:22:48,459 --> 00:22:50,542
In this case, the proxy server.

353
00:22:50,542 --> 00:22:57,250
In this case we are going to use an IPv6 proxy with Evil FOCA.

354
00:22:57,250 --> 00:23:00,999
The idea is that Evil FOCA is going to do everything for you.

355
00:23:02,959 --> 00:23:06,584
Evil FOCA configures the D sensor to WPAD and listens

356
00:23:06,584 --> 00:23:12,083
in the IPv6 network and routes all traffic between IPv4 and IPv6.

357
00:23:12,167 --> 00:23:13,959
Let's do a demo.

358
00:23:15,125 --> 00:23:21,751
And then we only need to -- I am going to ...

359
00:23:23,999 --> 00:23:27,834
disable and enable the network interface.

360
00:23:28,959 --> 00:23:37,209
And I am going to, everything from the beginning.

361
00:23:38,167 --> 00:23:39,834
Disable.

362
00:23:39,999 --> 00:23:41,459
And enable.

363
00:23:43,584 --> 00:23:49,209
And then go to Evil FOCA.

364
00:23:50,999 --> 00:23:58,999
Open Evil FOCA and then we select Web proxy, discovery, and click

365
00:23:58,999 --> 00:24:01,709
and that's it.

366
00:24:01,751 --> 00:24:04,292
And right now we have here that we are working the man

367
00:24:04,292 --> 00:24:06,999
in the middle attack for Web browser discovery

368
00:24:06,999 --> 00:24:09,834
and then we need to wait until Web browser auto

369
00:24:09,834 --> 00:24:11,959
discovery appeared.

370
00:24:14,876 --> 00:24:18,709
Let's open Internet Explorer.

371
00:24:18,959 --> 00:24:20,959
Let's close Internet Explorer.

372
00:24:21,083 --> 00:24:23,918
And let's open it again.

373
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:29,334
And let's see, okay.

374
00:24:29,334 --> 00:24:37,876
Now the proxy is up and the client has requested the file.

375
00:24:38,083 --> 00:24:41,667
So everything is okay.

376
00:24:41,751 --> 00:24:43,626
We can do something like Google.com.

377
00:24:49,417 --> 00:24:52,751
Let's see if the Internet is working very well.

378
00:24:58,918 --> 00:25:04,999
Google, Google.

379
00:25:05,375 --> 00:25:07,417
Internet, please?

380
00:25:07,792 --> 00:25:08,959
Be a good guy.

381
00:25:19,501 --> 00:25:20,999
Here it is.

382
00:25:20,999 --> 00:25:21,999
Okay.

383
00:25:22,999 --> 00:25:25,999
We are doing the man in the middle again using different

384
00:25:25,999 --> 00:25:29,083
protocol, but we need, we wanted more.

385
00:25:29,709 --> 00:25:31,501
So this was the demo.

386
00:25:31,751 --> 00:25:38,959
The demo was that the client sent, the victim sent for WPAD record.

387
00:25:38,959 --> 00:25:42,999
Then we answer saying no, no, it is not an IPv4.

388
00:25:42,999 --> 00:25:43,999
It's IPv6.

389
00:25:43,999 --> 00:25:47,292
Then the victim asks again about the WPAD record,

390
00:25:47,292 --> 00:25:51,999
but in this case searching for IPv6 address.

391
00:25:51,999 --> 00:25:55,083
We confirm yes, this is the IPv6 of the Web proxy

392
00:25:55,083 --> 00:25:58,083
of the discovery server.

393
00:25:58,459 --> 00:26:02,167
Then victim connects to the Web server requesting

394
00:26:02,167 --> 00:26:07,751
the pack file with the information about the proxy.

395
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:12,751
We sent that information with the IPv6 and the port

396
00:26:12,751 --> 00:26:19,999
in which Evil FOCA is listening and the rest is just capturing the data.

397
00:26:19,999 --> 00:26:21,667
So bonus level.

398
00:26:23,542 --> 00:26:26,999
What happened with https connection?

399
00:26:27,334 --> 00:26:29,999
Well, there are several options.

400
00:26:29,999 --> 00:26:33,999
First one is to do an SSL strip.

401
00:26:33,999 --> 00:26:37,999
The idea is that we analyze all HTML pages and remove the S

402
00:26:37,999 --> 00:26:39,999
of the links.

403
00:26:40,167 --> 00:26:45,292
The second one is to use a fake certificate and try to cheat

404
00:26:45,292 --> 00:26:51,375
the user to click on, okay, I accept this certificate.

405
00:26:51,626 --> 00:26:55,501
And the third one is to do a bridging https.

406
00:26:55,501 --> 00:26:59,999
That means that FOCA is connecting to the server using https.

407
00:27:00,792 --> 00:27:04,999
And the client is connecting to Evil FOCA using http.

408
00:27:05,292 --> 00:27:10,999
And if FOCA is doing SSL strip and bridging https so far,

409
00:27:10,999 --> 00:27:17,125
we have a special feature that is to remove the https links

410
00:27:17,125 --> 00:27:22,083
in Google results and also the Redit.

411
00:27:23,083 --> 00:27:24,959
Here are the results.

412
00:27:24,959 --> 00:27:30,626
We have Google and as you see, we try to open Gmail we have

413
00:27:30,626 --> 00:27:32,999
an http link.

414
00:27:32,999 --> 00:27:42,209
If we search for Facebook, we have the Facebook -- Facebook in Spanish,

415
00:27:42,209 --> 00:27:44,542
you know?

416
00:27:44,999 --> 00:27:46,959
Facebook in Spanish.

417
00:27:46,999 --> 00:27:49,999
And the link is an http.

418
00:27:49,999 --> 00:27:55,375
We only need to click on it and then go to Evil FOCA.

419
00:27:55,709 --> 00:27:58,292
And open Wireshark.

420
00:27:59,501 --> 00:28:02,626
Here it is.

421
00:28:04,667 --> 00:28:09,999
Open Wireshark.

422
00:28:09,999 --> 00:28:11,083
Capture interface.

423
00:28:11,876 --> 00:28:20,626
Start and we got all traffic here and we only need to go here and test.

424
00:28:21,626 --> 00:28:22,999
Oh.

425
00:28:23,999 --> 00:28:25,751
Come on.

426
00:28:26,751 --> 00:28:28,999
This is still loading.

427
00:28:32,375 --> 00:28:39,083
Open -- what is my password?

428
00:28:42,584 --> 00:28:46,292
(Laughter.)    CHEMA ALONSO: Evil FOCA.

429
00:28:46,292 --> 00:28:47,292
Where is the enter?

430
00:28:48,999 --> 00:28:50,292
No!

431
00:28:50,417 --> 00:28:51,792
I don't remember.

432
00:28:51,999 --> 00:29:01,999
(Laughter.)    CHEMA ALONSO: And if we go to the other part and we search

433
00:29:01,999 --> 00:29:10,999
for http request meth-op, request equal post, we got ...

434
00:29:13,501 --> 00:29:16,250
user and password of Facebook.

435
00:29:16,501 --> 00:29:27,125
Oh, here it is.

436
00:29:27,125 --> 00:29:30,167
(Applause.)    CHEMA ALONSO: Well, it is man in the middle attacking --

437
00:29:30,167 --> 00:29:33,834
in IPv4 network using IPv6 in the Spanish way.

438
00:29:33,959 --> 00:29:35,417
And this was the demo.

439
00:29:36,375 --> 00:29:42,083
In this tool we also added other different attacks just in case.

440
00:29:42,083 --> 00:29:46,083
Like denial of services in IPv6.

441
00:29:46,876 --> 00:29:49,709
Man in the middle attacks in IPv4.

442
00:29:49,709 --> 00:29:51,709
Denial of service in IPv6.

443
00:29:51,709 --> 00:29:52,709
DNS hijacking.

444
00:29:52,709 --> 00:29:55,083
We are going to add also to inject Javascript

445
00:29:55,083 --> 00:29:58,209
to create Javascript bond net.

446
00:29:58,417 --> 00:30:00,250
Remember last year's talk.

447
00:30:00,334 --> 00:30:02,584
And that's the conclusion.

448
00:30:02,584 --> 00:30:04,125
IPv6 is in your network.

449
00:30:04,125 --> 00:30:05,584
Configure it or kill it.

450
00:30:05,584 --> 00:30:06,999
It is not easy to kill it.

451
00:30:06,999 --> 00:30:13,959
IPv6, if you have security tools for IPv4, probably they are not working for IPv6.

452
00:30:13,959 --> 00:30:18,584
And right now there are a lot of security tools using IPv6,

453
00:30:18,584 --> 00:30:23,542
like Topella, which is scanning using IPv6, slow Lotus

454
00:30:23,542 --> 00:30:26,459
is immigrate to IPv6.

455
00:30:26,459 --> 00:30:31,626
We got several vulnerabilities in IPv6 products and so on.

456
00:30:31,876 --> 00:30:35,667
And I would like to give big thanks to the people

457
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:39,999
behind the hacker choice because they did a very, very,

458
00:30:39,999 --> 00:30:43,209
very good job with IPv6 tools.

459
00:30:43,209 --> 00:30:47,042
If you got backtrack or colleague, use it because they have a lot

460
00:30:47,042 --> 00:30:49,042
of good tools.

461
00:30:49,042 --> 00:30:52,999
And even Scapy, it's wonderful to test all solutions.

462
00:30:53,626 --> 00:30:56,999
The last word is for Strip Fighter.

463
00:30:56,999 --> 00:31:00,999
Who in the hell designed the Spanish fighter, half bullfighter,

464
00:31:00,999 --> 00:31:04,167
half wolverine with hockey mask.

465
00:31:04,167 --> 00:31:05,918
It doesn't make sense at all.

466
00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:09,999
See you next year.
