1
00:00:00,110 -->  00:00:04,720
   Goon: All right. This is going to be the
meet the VC panel. FYI there are two mics

2
00:00:04,720 -->  00:00:07,990
there. If you have any questions when it's
Q&A by direction here, please go to one of

3
00:00:07,990 -->  00:00:13,049
the mics. Cool. Let's give them a big hand.
(Applause).

4
00:00:13,049 -->  00:00:20,049
   JOHN HERING: Cool. So I'm John Hering.
I work at a company called Lookout. Lookout

5
00:00:23,430 -->  00:00:27,230
does mobile security. We actually started
here at DEF CON. After a number of years of

6
00:00:27,230 -->  00:00:30,870
doing research and spending time here in the
community, we were able to build a business

7
00:00:30,870 -->  00:00:34,440
and ended up raising venture capital. So we
thought it would be interesting sharing our

8
00:00:34,440 -->  00:00:38,870
stories and getting to know some of the top
venture capitalists.

9
00:00:38,870 -->  00:00:43,050
Maybe we can introduce ourselves, starting
with you, JJ.

10
00:00:43,050 -->  00:00:50,050
   JOHN JACK: Hello. My name is John Jack.
I go by JJ. Clever. I was the CEO of a security

11
00:00:51,420 -->  00:00:57,130
company called Fortify Software, which was
security at the application level. We were

12
00:00:57,130 -->  00:01:02,110
one of the pioneers in that space at least
in terms of commercializing a lot of work

13
00:01:02,110 -->  00:01:07,560
that had been done prior to us starting the
company.

14
00:01:07,560 -->  00:01:13,400
We grew that company fairly well. Became the
standard in financial institutions, governments,

15
00:01:13,400 -->  00:01:20,040
telcos and actually the standard in commercial
software providers, people like Oracle and

16
00:01:20,040 -->  00:01:26,940
SAP and EMC all used this product in order
to root out vulnerabilities in the software

17
00:01:26,940 -->  00:01:32,360
that they delivered to their customers.
That company was acquired by Hewlett Packard

18
00:01:32,360 -->  00:01:39,360
in 2010. Previous to that I was CEO of a couple
other companies. One we sold to VMware. One

19
00:01:40,600 -->  00:01:47,600
we sold to a company called Corporate Data.
And now I work part time with a VC firm called

20
00:01:51,150 -->  00:01:57,049
Andreessen Horowitz. We have a number of investments
in security.

21
00:01:57,049 -->  00:02:02,960
And I also part time do some consulting and
serve as an independent Director on other

22
00:02:02,960 -->  00:02:09,960
venture backed companies. Thank you.
   MATT OCKO: Hi. I'm Matt Ocko. I very unglamorously

23
00:02:12,090 -->  00:02:19,090
go by Matt. I'm the co-founder and co-managing
partner of a firm called Data Collective.

24
00:02:20,370 -->  00:02:27,020
We like doing deep, dark, difficult stuff
that most of our venture colleagues ironically,

25
00:02:27,020 -->  00:02:33,010
except for the guys on this panel, disdain
or don't understand. It's where we've made

26
00:02:33,010 -->  00:02:40,010
most of our money. It seems to be a reasonable
thesis across 220 companies over nearly 25

27
00:02:42,319 -->  00:02:49,190
years we've had fewer than 20 losses and we've
made our entrepreneurs about $30 billion net

28
00:02:49,190 -->  00:02:56,190
of boom, bust, IRS, you name it.
I think some of the distinguishing characters

29
00:02:59,269 -->  00:03:04,459
of our firm that may be a little unusual is
that three out of the four partners still

30
00:03:04,459 -->  00:03:11,440
read and write code. Still understand chip
design. If you show me a 10 million gig design

31
00:03:11,440 -->  00:03:18,440
and are lying to me about the clock tree,
I will know. And we've really enjoyed doing

32
00:03:18,440 -->  00:03:24,610
really fundamental stuff. We're the seed investors
in XenSource and very early on in VeriSign

33
00:03:24,610 -->  00:03:30,310
a number of companies in the security space
are important parts of Google and VMware and

34
00:03:30,310 -->  00:03:35,140
Facebook and some other demanding customers
around the world. And we love this stuff and

35
00:03:35,140 -->  00:03:39,860
I'm very happy to be here today.
   PING LI: Good afternoon. I'm Ping Li, a

36
00:03:39,860 -->  00:03:46,860
partner at Accel. Been doing venture investment
for about ten years now, brought Accel over

37
00:03:48,950 -->  00:03:55,950
from the see stage to the growth stage. Offices
over in the U.S., Silicon Valley, London,

38
00:03:56,930 -->  00:04:02,159
China and India. Our goal is always to find
exciting entrepreneurs that are trying to

39
00:04:02,159 -->  00:04:06,489
build category defining companies and been
investing in security for quite some time

40
00:04:06,489 -->  00:04:11,260
and this is just one of many companies we
work with.

41
00:04:11,260 -->  00:04:18,260
   DEEPAK JEEVANKUMAR: Hi I'm Deepak Jeevankumar
from General Catalyst Partners. Okay. We are

42
00:04:21,979 -->  00:04:26,159
an early stage and late stage venture capital
firm with $2.5 billion under management and

43
00:04:26,159 -->  00:04:31,469
we have bagged companies under multiple industries
including cyber-security some investments

44
00:04:31,469 -->  00:04:38,469
are Kayak, Caribbean Bay, Stripe, Snapchat.
And we also have not shied away from hard

45
00:04:43,009 -->  00:04:47,240
technology investment.
So actually I used to share an investment

46
00:04:47,240 -->  00:04:53,599
called BBN technologies where the early Internet
research was done and one of our companies

47
00:04:53,599 -->  00:05:00,339
called reveal imaging are hardware for bomb
scanners and only one customer called TSA

48
00:05:00,339 -->  00:05:06,569
so personally I started writing code when
I was about 7 or 8 years old I don't remember

49
00:05:06,569 -->  00:05:11,479
now and first one was logo I don't know if
you ever used logo before.

50
00:05:11,479 -->  00:05:18,249
And I have hacked quite a bit and I think
I was lucky to be involved in two of the largest

51
00:05:18,249 -->  00:05:24,319
super computing projects I was an architect
on those projects in human history. So happy

52
00:05:24,319 -->  00:05:31,319
to share. And happy to --> I hope we can convince
more of you to become entrepreneurs in cyber-security.

53
00:05:31,580 -->  00:05:35,430
   So it's interesting this is my 11th year
at DEF CON I can tell you when I first started

54
00:05:35,430 -->  00:05:40,969
coming it's not something I would expect to
see venture capitalists at DEF CON it's definitely

55
00:05:40,969 -->  00:05:45,339
changed a lot as time has gone on just the
interest from a mainstream capacity and cyber-security

56
00:05:45,339 -->  00:05:50,849
in general has changed a lot as this technology
has touched the fabric of society and peoples

57
00:05:50,849 -->  00:05:56,240
everyday life I'm curious what are you guys
looking for I'm sure people in the audience

58
00:05:56,240 -->  00:06:00,099
are curious as they are building projects
and whatnot what will it take to be funded

59
00:06:00,099 -->  00:06:04,229
by a venture capitalists what are the types
of things when you're looking for a security

60
00:06:04,229 -->  00:06:08,150
investment and looking for --> looking for
people at a conference like this?

61
00:06:08,150 -->  00:06:15,150
   Okay. We're still going in reverse order.
Because it says No. 4 here.

62
00:06:18,069 -->  00:06:25,069
So I would not --> I won't address the technical
side of it because my background I think you

63
00:06:25,189 -->  00:06:30,349
can tell from the introduction is not --> I'm
not a super --> I'm not a hacker despite the

64
00:06:30,349 -->  00:06:37,349
shirt that I proudly wear.
I can tell you that I would say two things

65
00:06:37,360 -->  00:06:43,029
in terms of what do we look for in a security
investment. I mean, the first is obviously

66
00:06:43,029 -->  00:06:50,029
we look for something that has a wide applicability
so that the market opportunity is big.

67
00:06:50,129 -->  00:06:55,429
And if you take --> if you think about how
you can leverage a large market opportunity,

68
00:06:55,429 -->  00:07:01,580
one of the key things is: Are you leveraging
something beyond just a security solution?

69
00:07:01,580 -->  00:07:07,129
So a lot of security solutions are frankly
point solutions to address a tough problem

70
00:07:07,129 -->  00:07:09,809
in security.
And you can make some nice companies out of

71
00:07:09,809 -->  00:07:13,219
that.
But if you're also leveraging another major

72
00:07:13,219 -->  00:07:19,039
trend, so for example, enterprises moving
to the cloud and cloud-based applications,

73
00:07:19,039 -->  00:07:23,899
so one of the investments we made at Andreessen
Horowitz in which I'm on the Board is called

74
00:07:23,899 -->  00:07:30,899
CipherCloud and what CipherCloud does is essentially
allow people who use sales force and Office

75
00:07:31,349 -->  00:07:37,839
365 and Gmail and box and other cloud-based
applications, it allows them to secure the

76
00:07:37,839 -->  00:07:43,319
data that's in the cloud such that if a Government
organization sites the Patriot Act and says

77
00:07:43,319 -->  00:07:49,300
to sales force give us all of the data for
XYZ company the data is encrypted it won't

78
00:07:49,300 -->  00:07:54,309
be meaningful so it's therefore protected
when you're in a heavy regulated industry

79
00:07:54,309 -->  00:07:59,439
that's something you need to address so there's
a company that's not only solved a security

80
00:07:59,439 -->  00:08:06,439
issue but is also leveraging a broader trend
in technology which is people moving workloads

81
00:08:07,919 -->  00:08:11,610
from on premise into the cloud in one form
or another.

82
00:08:11,610 -->  00:08:18,610
So that's an example of looking at an opportunity
that might be bigger than just a purpose-built

83
00:08:21,860 -->  00:08:28,860
specific solution to a security problem. The
other thing I would say is we look for really

84
00:08:31,050 -->  00:08:38,050
smart entrepreneurs that are super motivated.
That really have a lot of drive, a lot of

85
00:08:41,029 -->  00:08:47,509
ambition and really want to be successful.
And so when you put those two together, you

86
00:08:47,509 -->  00:08:54,269
have kind of a winning formula.
   So I think John makes an excellent point.

87
00:08:54,269 -->  00:09:00,930
Big markets are important. But in a number
of the investments that we've done, some of

88
00:09:00,930 -->  00:09:07,930
which actually ended up being co-investments
with Ping's team at Accel or John's team at

89
00:09:08,449 -->  00:09:15,449
Andreessen is as they went through the end
of their seed stage or into later stages,

90
00:09:15,940 -->  00:09:21,250
are distinguished by not addressing a big
market today.

91
00:09:21,250 -->  00:09:28,250
So you know half the Fortune 500 runs or more
than half --> 90% of the Fortune 500, 95% runs

92
00:09:30,740 -->  00:09:37,740
these village anti-virus systems. That's a
big market you can say hey, 10 bucks on every

93
00:09:39,399 -->  00:09:44,800
aging desktop PC for the U.S. and other G7
countries. It's a big market.

94
00:09:44,800 -->  00:09:50,170
We have no interest in that. We are interested
in the stuff that's going to cause a CIO or

95
00:09:50,170 -->  00:09:57,170
a CSO to in a late stage adopter company three
years from now to panic and say: I must have

96
00:09:59,680 -->  00:10:06,680
this at all cost. Because one of the dark
but unspoken truisms in venture capital is

97
00:10:08,939 -->  00:10:12,449
anything worth doing actually takes a long
time.

98
00:10:12,449 -->  00:10:14,689
And all of these sort of --
(Applause).

99
00:10:14,689 -->  00:10:20,439
   MATT OCKO: Huge fantasy outcomes that are
celebrated as overnight successes or inevitable

100
00:10:20,439 -->  00:10:27,439
successes like a Google, actually took 7 or
8 years of really hard work. Things like Nacera

101
00:10:33,310 -->  00:10:38,740
to Andreessen for having the foresight to
invest in that are kind of random events.

102
00:10:38,740 -->  00:10:43,000
So when you're building a product, it's doing
something meaningful. By the time you've got

103
00:10:43,000 -->  00:10:47,910
it polished and by the time somebody is going
to pay you actually gives a crap it's been

104
00:10:47,910 -->  00:10:52,800
a couple of years, maybe more.
So you're looking at stuff that will motivate

105
00:10:52,800 -->  00:10:57,629
a customer today you've already put yourself
out of the running.

106
00:10:57,629 -->  00:11:03,480
So to do that, to John's point, takes incredible
intestinal fortitude. It takes people who

107
00:11:03,480 -->  00:11:09,000
can solve difficult multidimensional problems
about how to run their company and keep their

108
00:11:09,000 -->  00:11:14,550
team happy and keep their customers happy
all at the same time on limited amounts of

109
00:11:14,550 -->  00:11:21,480
money. And because you're doing for the gusto
for some of you in the future, it takes incredible

110
00:11:21,480 -->  00:11:28,480
tech jobs. So everybody on this panel is motivated
not to invest in me too tech even if it's

111
00:11:29,019 -->  00:11:34,569
looking three years out or something undifferentiated.
We want to see stuff that has sustainable

112
00:11:34,569 -->  00:11:41,569
competitive advantage.
So two interesting examples.

113
00:11:41,670 -->  00:11:48,670
We're in a company called Sentinel. We did
with Ping's crew at Accel. Those guys are

114
00:11:54,540 -->  00:11:59,509
stemming a lot of existing security assumptions
on its head. They are doing something very,

115
00:11:59,509 -->  00:12:04,499
very interesting that actually produces deterministic
results for important stuff and runs only

116
00:12:04,499 -->  00:12:07,790
in user space they don't hook through kernel
at all.

117
00:12:07,790 -->  00:12:13,509
I was astonished. I didn't believe it. It
took me a long time to understand it. But

118
00:12:13,509 -->  00:12:18,180
it's light years ahead of anything else out
there. That was worth doing. We're in a company

119
00:12:18,180 -->  00:12:23,579
with John and his team at A16Z called the
Lumio that's doing things that people said

120
00:12:23,579 -->  00:12:30,579
was impossible to enforce security for fungible
workloads in the cloud.

121
00:12:32,019 -->  00:12:35,850
And by the way, John, I think it's fair to
say that when those guys started doing that,

122
00:12:35,850 -->  00:12:41,310
most people were disdainful that real corporate
compute workloads would move to the cloud.

123
00:12:41,310 -->  00:12:47,629
So anyway, I hope that's useful.
   Yeah the one he point I would echo that

124
00:12:47,629 -->  00:12:51,410
matches that is --> I would --> some of the
security markets that become really large

125
00:12:51,410 -->  00:12:56,560
aren't obvious at first and China the great
entrepreneurs are the ones that kind of see

126
00:12:56,560 -->  00:13:01,639
around the corner I remember when we first
invested in John's company, John Hering's

127
00:13:01,639 -->  00:13:07,420
company years ago around mobile security the
Android phone didn't really exist. The iPhone

128
00:13:07,420 -->  00:13:11,920
was just shifting. It wasn't obvious there
was going to be any security problems with

129
00:13:11,920 -->  00:13:16,860
the mobile phone at the time. And having that
foresight to be that ahead of the market and

130
00:13:16,860 -->  00:13:22,579
understanding where the hackers are going
to be I think is a real set of instincts we

131
00:13:22,579 -->  00:13:27,279
look for. Security is particularly hard to
invest in because it's an arm's race every

132
00:13:27,279 -->  00:13:31,639
time somebody comes to our office with a great
idea there's ten hackers out there with a

133
00:13:31,639 -->  00:13:36,699
better idea that's going to get around his
great idea so you really have to find entrepreneurs

134
00:13:36,699 -->  00:13:41,360
that we found that really have been coming
to DEF CON for it the last X number of years

135
00:13:41,360 -->  00:13:46,029
they have to be on the cutting edge of whatever
the hacker community is thinking about and

136
00:13:46,029 -->  00:13:51,379
pushing the envelope on and that's really
hard to find. Folks that actually understand

137
00:13:51,379 -->  00:13:55,970
the problem but also understand the opportunity
to build a company around that intersection

138
00:13:55,970 -->  00:14:00,520
is really rare and that's kind of what we
look for in security.

139
00:14:00,520 -->  00:14:07,520
   I totally agree with most of those points.
The one thing I would like to add is we are

140
00:14:09,749 -->  00:14:13,589
at the intersection of three major trends
at the same time in the history of Computer

141
00:14:13,589 -->  00:14:18,629
Science and technology, mobile, Cloud Computing
and big data. A lot of people have written

142
00:14:18,629 -->  00:14:23,819
about this. But what that means is that they
are going to see multidimensional security

143
00:14:23,819 -->  00:14:30,319
problems they have never seen before. So it
is an amazingly good time to be starting to

144
00:14:30,319 -->  00:14:36,269
think about innovations in cyber-security.
Actually yesterday I saw an article on cyber-security

145
00:14:36,269 -->  00:14:42,819
for the app economy but the point I make is
that we have to make tools that are faster

146
00:14:42,819 -->  00:14:46,870
and more better than things that they have
seen before. Because of its multidimensional

147
00:14:46,870 -->  00:14:53,870
things that existed in terms of entrepreneurs
that we look for specifically, No. 1 you need

148
00:14:55,860 -->  00:14:59,790
to be great evangelists of your product without
overselling it.

149
00:14:59,790 -->  00:15:06,790
Then No. 2 is you should have the ability
to look around market changes because markets

150
00:15:06,850 -->  00:15:12,209
do change human behavior changes very rapidly
than what we think it does.

151
00:15:12,209 -->  00:15:16,459
Then and to Ping's point you need to be best
of breed in what you do and you need to stand

152
00:15:16,459 -->  00:15:22,189
the test of your peer groups who are almost
as good as you or even better than you.

153
00:15:22,189 -->  00:15:29,189
   John, if I might, I guess broadly speaking,
everybody in this audience is kind of in the

154
00:15:31,009 -->  00:15:38,009
cat-bird seat for building a company because
as much as Fluffy consumer companies get love

155
00:15:40,550 -->  00:15:47,189
and attention and big valuations, that's actually
not where the real money is.

156
00:15:47,189 -->  00:15:53,519
And everybody in this room is probably aware
of somewhere between a mini to a full-scale

157
00:15:53,519 -->  00:16:00,519
security Holocaust that's in process.
I mean, I'm pretty convinced that RSA up to

158
00:16:01,009 -->  00:16:08,009
512 bits is irretrievably broken. Which means
every bank and web server in DNS out there

159
00:16:08,300 -->  00:16:13,199
is effectively vulnerable right now. I would
say that's a pretty large problem. And the

160
00:16:13,199 -->  00:16:18,069
only alternative --> you know I mean there
aren't alternatives. The only practical one

161
00:16:18,069 -->  00:16:25,069
is stuck rotting away inside of RIM. So there's
a giant $10 billion company right there that

162
00:16:25,209 -->  00:16:30,910
I don't see anybody doing right now.
You know, people are fantasizing about the

163
00:16:30,910 -->  00:16:36,860
so-called Internet of Things. I can't even
leave my Bluetooth on here because I really

164
00:16:36,860 -->  00:16:43,860
prefer not to pay for you guys' next vacation.
And so everything from my future pacemaker

165
00:16:45,540 -->  00:16:52,160
to the electric meter on my house to the thing
that orders food for my kids and my refrigerator

166
00:16:52,160 -->  00:16:58,980
circuit 2020 is going to be produced by the
same ass clowns that can't even have effective

167
00:16:58,980 -->  00:17:05,800
security on my phone?
(Applause).

168
00:17:05,800 -->  00:17:10,520
   So I mean, John asked a really good question:
What are we looking for? Well the answer is

169
00:17:10,520 -->  00:17:15,659
we're looking for you guys to step up much
as John did when everybody was pretty smug

170
00:17:15,659 -->  00:17:21,490
about the state of mobile security, shocked
the hell out of us and produced a giant solution

171
00:17:21,490 -->  00:17:27,270
to a giant problem that nobody was thinking
about. And also I would really to --> like

172
00:17:27,270 -->  00:17:31,799
to not pay for your next vacation in the process.
   I turned off my Bluetooth.

173
00:17:31,799 -->  00:17:36,629
   Well I remembered to turn off mine about
an hour ago.

174
00:17:36,629 -->  00:17:40,740
   Let me ask the audience a question.
You meet lots of people working on super interesting

175
00:17:40,740 -->  00:17:47,010
projects many of which can be intellectually
interesting but many times won't end up being

176
00:17:47,010 -->  00:17:50,210
a business of the scale we talked about of
billions of dollars doesn't mean it's not

177
00:17:50,210 -->  00:17:54,950
interesting when does it make sense not to
raise venture capital from someone like yourselves

178
00:17:54,950 -->  00:18:00,130
how do you think about the difference between
the types of things you would actually want

179
00:18:00,130 -->  00:18:03,980
to fund and the types of things someone might
want to turn into a business or doesn't make

180
00:18:03,980 -->  00:18:09,870
sense to talk to you guys.
   Are we pushing or popping the stack.

181
00:18:09,870 -->  00:18:15,690
   We're pushing.
   I'll try to be as brief as I can. There's

182
00:18:15,690 -->  00:18:22,120
a concept in finance called net present value.
How many of you guys are familiar with that?

183
00:18:22,120 -->  00:18:28,110
Awesome. That's a disturbingly well educated
hacker crowd.

184
00:18:28,110 -->  00:18:35,110
So the dirty secret or the other dirty secret
of venture capital is that your MPV utility

185
00:18:38,279 -->  00:18:45,279
curve and the VC's MPV utility curve is diverge
pretty rapidly. So thanks to a feature of

186
00:18:48,250 -->  00:18:53,799
preferred stock investment, most VCs get the
right to keep investing in your company every

187
00:18:53,799 -->  00:18:58,380
time you take money. Which means as long as
we have deep enough pockets, our stake doesn't

188
00:18:58,380 -->  00:19:01,399
go down and it may in fact go up a little
bit.

189
00:19:01,399 -->  00:19:08,399
Your slice of the pie as more new dollars
pour in is in effect reduced over time as

190
00:19:09,220 -->  00:19:13,450
you continue to build a company.
So if you build a really giant company and

191
00:19:13,450 -->  00:19:19,770
you and your founding team own 10%, and you
sell it for a billion dollars after ten years,

192
00:19:19,770 -->  00:19:26,720
that's $100 million that seems like a pretty
good outcome but if you own 80% of your company

193
00:19:26,720 -->  00:19:32,610
and you sell it for $100 million two years
into it, that's $80 million.

194
00:19:32,610 -->  00:19:39,610
So you would have had a better MPV selling
earlier than later for a supposedly more impressive

195
00:19:40,559 -->  00:19:44,500
number.
And when you factor in risk, building billion

196
00:19:44,500 -->  00:19:51,500
dollar outcomes is really freaking hard. You're
definitely better off selling for 80 million

197
00:19:51,940 -->  00:19:57,070
bucks in two years now that's also --> that
magic outcome is hard to do and I'm picking

198
00:19:57,070 -->  00:20:04,070
deliberately simplistic examples. But when
you are pretty sure that you have a point

199
00:20:04,690 -->  00:20:10,380
solution I think as John referred to that
solves a really difficult problem that's quote-unqoute

200
00:20:10,380 -->  00:20:17,380
awesome family business makes 10 or $15 million
a year with great cash flow for you and your

201
00:20:18,299 -->  00:20:24,649
friends. That's probably not a business that
you want to take venture capital for. There's

202
00:20:24,649 -->  00:20:30,220
no reason for you guys to dilute yourselves.
If you need money take angel money keep 80%

203
00:20:30,220 -->  00:20:37,220
of your equity and when one of the big bruisers
panics and real ice they need this solution

204
00:20:38,179 -->  00:20:42,419
pays you a million bucks laugh all the way
to the bank if you are doing one of these

205
00:20:42,419 -->  00:20:49,419
global platforms that John and Ping alluded
to, the kind of thing I alluded to like replacing

206
00:20:50,440 -->  00:20:55,779
all of RSA then you probably need venture
capital, you probably need people who have

207
00:20:55,779 -->  00:21:00,630
been through it before whether they are CEOs
like John or other former operating guys like

208
00:21:00,630 -->  00:21:07,429
Ping to help you build that gigantic business
so that's kind of how I see the world.

209
00:21:07,429 -->  00:21:14,049
   I'll give two examples to kind of put a
point to what Matt is saying. The answer isn't

210
00:21:14,049 -->  00:21:19,470
always venture capital. You know, we are currently
an investor for a company called Tenebel (phonetic).

211
00:21:19,470 -->  00:21:26,070
A guy that created Nexus and that company
was bootstrapped by the founders for I think

212
00:21:26,070 -->  00:21:30,860
five, six years before we even put any money
into the company it was profitable growing

213
00:21:30,860 -->  00:21:37,860
very rapidly Nexus is a very popular scanning
tool they didn't need the money because the

214
00:21:37,960 -->  00:21:42,630
business could fund itself and they didn't
need someone like myself because they knew

215
00:21:42,630 -->  00:21:46,250
they didn't need those resources in the network
to grow their business. It was growing very

216
00:21:46,250 -->  00:21:48,690
fine.
And then in the last year or so they decided

217
00:21:48,690 -->  00:21:53,909
they saw a larger opportunity around going
global but extending the product line whether

218
00:21:53,909 -->  00:21:58,970
they need additional capital more importantly
they needed a partner that knew and had experience

219
00:21:58,970 -->  00:22:03,500
in expanding the business in ways they hadn't
expanded before so the decision to make and

220
00:22:03,500 -->  00:22:07,250
take venture capital was less about the money
since the business is profitable but more

221
00:22:07,250 -->  00:22:13,260
about the expertise and value add a partner
can bring. In the case of John Hering's lookout

222
00:22:13,260 -->  00:22:18,269
it was very different obviously from the very
beginning they were going after exploiting

223
00:22:18,269 -->  00:22:22,690
market in the mobile security space where
speed to market, time to market and getting

224
00:22:22,690 -->  00:22:28,750
out ahead of the mobile platform which is
getting innovated by Google and Apple was

225
00:22:28,750 -->  00:22:33,440
a precondition they had to deal with on Day
1 where venture capital was needed to accelerate

226
00:22:33,440 -->  00:22:37,960
the business and also helping to scale the
team and doing a lot of other things around

227
00:22:37,960 -->  00:22:43,590
company building was needed Day 1 so I think
it all really depends I don't believe for

228
00:22:43,590 -->  00:22:47,330
the majority of the businesses out there that
you require venture capital.

229
00:22:47,330 -->  00:22:51,309
I think it's something that you should look
at deeply before you take money. Because as

230
00:22:51,309 -->  00:22:57,230
Matt says, once you take money from another
partner, it's a partnership and it's not a

231
00:22:57,230 -->  00:23:02,250
sole proprietorship anymore and I think that's
a big transition so I think it really depends

232
00:23:02,250 -->  00:23:06,909
on the opportunity and what you want to do.
   If I could jump in, I think Ping makes

233
00:23:06,909 -->  00:23:13,909
a great point that sometimes there's a perception
of what venture capital is you get money and

234
00:23:14,429 -->  00:23:18,950
then the VC comes to your Board meeting hoping
you're doing well.

235
00:23:18,950 -->  00:23:21,179
   We do that, too.
(Chuckles).

236
00:23:21,179 -->  00:23:28,179
   That --
   You really do --> in the early stages, if

237
00:23:28,470 -->  00:23:35,470
you are --> if you do decide to accept venture
funding, you really do need to look for a

238
00:23:35,490 -->  00:23:40,679
partner. You really do need to look for a
firm that has people and services that will

239
00:23:40,679 -->  00:23:46,740
add value to what you're trying to do these
firms you see up here have done a lot of work

240
00:23:46,740 -->  00:23:53,429
in security obviously we all have resources
that helps you be successful. At Andreessen

241
00:23:53,429 -->  00:24:00,429
Horowitz we have the executive briefing center
that John knows about that we bring in chief

242
00:24:00,440 -->  00:24:06,279
security officers and Government officials
and all sorts of people on a weekly basis

243
00:24:06,279 -->  00:24:13,029
and bring in our portfolio companies and they
get to present to people even before they

244
00:24:13,029 -->  00:24:20,029
have released the product to test the market
for their idea and as they mature like John's

245
00:24:20,039 -->  00:24:27,039
company has, they get to talk to real buyers
of the solution and that's a real big service

246
00:24:27,510 -->  00:24:33,690
that for example Andreessen Horowitz we bring
for our entrepreneurs.

247
00:24:33,690 -->  00:24:39,730
So to Ping's point you really do want to pick
a partner that's often both the firm and the

248
00:24:39,730 -->  00:24:46,730
individual partner at the firm that's going
to be your chief liaison and help you grow

249
00:24:47,200 -->  00:24:52,100
the company.
   And actually, I want to chime in and amplify

250
00:24:52,100 -->  00:24:58,289
John's point. It's not just the firm. It's
not brand.

251
00:24:58,289 -->  00:25:04,210
There's a company that John and I actually
have in common that is desired right now by

252
00:25:04,210 -->  00:25:11,210
a lot of people in the venture capital community.
And they met with one of the very senior guys

253
00:25:11,850 -->  00:25:18,850
at one of the top ten firms in the world.
Every Fortune, Forbes article, you know, New

254
00:25:20,789 -->  00:25:26,950
York Times Wall Street you know TechCrunch,
however you want to view external validation

255
00:25:26,950 -->  00:25:33,950
the firms had it and to some extent this guy
had it as well and he was such an arrogant

256
00:25:35,700 -->  00:25:42,700
dickhead in the meeting that the entrepreneur
said not only will this guy be helpful whatever

257
00:25:43,840 -->  00:25:50,840
giant a check he wants to write but he'll
be actively harmful. And by contract and in

258
00:25:51,399 -->  00:25:58,399
credit to JJ the entrepreneur said look what
I want is somebody like JJ who is an operating

259
00:25:59,409 -->  00:26:03,539
guy, he has done real good stuff who has been
through good times and bad guys and can help

260
00:26:03,539 -->  00:26:08,380
me move a little further down the road basically
said I want another partner because I'm stuck

261
00:26:08,380 -->  00:26:15,380
in the boat with this person for ten years.
And you know Ping and his team are successful

262
00:26:16,149 -->  00:26:22,690
in this because they act like partners. And
the entrepreneurs we fund early on like both

263
00:26:22,690 -->  00:26:28,029
of these firms because they are happy with
them we are still waiting for Deepak to start

264
00:26:28,029 -->  00:26:35,029
writing checks. So it's the a gentle nudge.
We have a few for you, buddy.

265
00:26:35,470 -->  00:26:42,470
   Let me frame this problem as an entrepreneur
the odds of failure are higher than success.

266
00:26:46,990 -->  00:26:52,720
Every step you take every meeting you go to,
everyone you talk to should be able to increase

267
00:26:52,720 -->  00:26:56,929
the odds of success.
There's a fundamental underpinning here so

268
00:26:56,929 -->  00:27:02,039
all of the venture firms I can say largely
speaking are --> they help you to increase

269
00:27:02,039 -->  00:27:07,750
the odds of success through introductions
to the top CIOs and CSOs helping to find the

270
00:27:07,750 -->  00:27:13,049
right mentors for you finding a mentor is
really, really important never underrate that

271
00:27:13,049 -->  00:27:18,279
so I think some of the top VC funds can help
you do that.

272
00:27:18,279 -->  00:27:25,279
The other thing is when do you not take a
venture capital money to your question. If

273
00:27:25,490 -->  00:27:30,220
the business has low risk for example one
small check we do is can I bank --> can a bank

274
00:27:30,220 -->  00:27:37,220
lend to this company for expanding their business?
Definitely not. Then it's not a VC investment.

275
00:27:37,830 -->  00:27:42,610
We look for really high risk investments that
need to grow really fast banks look for low

276
00:27:42,610 -->  00:27:48,019
risk investments that don't grow that fast
typically venture capital will help you go

277
00:27:48,019 -->  00:27:54,590
from 0 to 100 million in three to four years
in that situation venture capital money is

278
00:27:54,590 -->  00:27:59,220
a good fit.
   So maybe I can share a quick story for

279
00:27:59,220 -->  00:28:04,029
those who might be interested and are thinking
about starting companies. On the flip side

280
00:28:04,029 -->  00:28:09,539
of all of this, too, is you can hear an infinite
amount of nos but you only need to hear yes

281
00:28:09,539 -->  00:28:14,080
once and it's really important to keep that
in mind I remember vividly when we were first

282
00:28:14,080 -->  00:28:19,440
getting off the ground we were doing obscure
wireless research and a lot of mobile stuff

283
00:28:19,440 -->  00:28:23,779
and there was not a lot of interest in what
we were doing at first Ping wrote us a check

284
00:28:23,779 -->  00:28:29,570
and a few of our early angels did but most
of our investors we pitched didn't understand

285
00:28:29,570 -->  00:28:35,820
what we were doing at all. And it's really
easy to get depressed when you're running

286
00:28:35,820 -->  00:28:39,870
around trying to raise money and everyone
is telling you you are basically an idiot

287
00:28:39,870 -->  00:28:44,269
but having the fortitude to continue on I
think is one of the greatest lessons I've

288
00:28:44,269 -->  00:28:48,080
ever learned in raising venture capital and
it never gets easier.

289
00:28:48,080 -->  00:28:53,059
You just get better. And hopefully the market
is on your side. But I vividly remember I

290
00:28:53,059 -->  00:28:57,779
don't know if --> sometimes it takes the irrational
-- like reasonable people will work on reasonable

291
00:28:57,779 -->  00:29:02,450
problems but consensus accurate predictions
never yield outside results really important

292
00:29:02,450 -->  00:29:07,929
to understand the outliers come from things
that aren't obvious and unreasonable people

293
00:29:07,929 -->  00:29:11,059
will work on unreasonable problems thus you
probably need to be pretty unreasonable to

294
00:29:11,059 -->  00:29:18,059
do something amazing this guy Vinod can be
an unreasonable dude and he's very brilliant

295
00:29:19,549 -->  00:29:23,950
founded Sun Microsystems I'll never forget
we were pitching him everyone had been telling

296
00:29:23,950 -->  00:29:27,730
us no and halfway through the meeting he's
like I've heard enough and I'm like shit he's

297
00:29:27,730 -->  00:29:34,250
going to throw us out this is horrible he's
like I'm in what is --> he wrote us a $5 million

298
00:29:34,250 -->  00:29:39,700
check I never experienced anything like that
after hearing 50 nos and something like that

299
00:29:39,700 -->  00:29:45,039
happens not long after that Accel got involved
and the company started to take off and there's

300
00:29:45,039 -->  00:29:49,700
definitely a world where this company would
never have existed if we didn't keep going

301
00:29:49,700 -->  00:29:53,740
not because we were there to make money or
build a business but because we love what

302
00:29:53,740 -->  00:30:00,740
we do there's 140 people at DEF CON from Lookout
we're a much bigger company it's who we are

303
00:30:01,120 -->  00:30:05,039
nothing has changed even though we're a lot
bigger that's really exciting to me and so

304
00:30:05,039 -->  00:30:08,639
I think it's something really important to
think about as everyone here starts businesses

305
00:30:08,639 -->  00:30:13,610
the foundation is passion and it's a lot about
having the fortitude to keep going.

306
00:30:13,610 -->  00:30:19,769
So my question for this group is: How do you
think about spotting the non-obvious investments?

307
00:30:19,769 -->  00:30:23,970
Like when you see deals that you're willing
to make a non-obvious investment in. I'm curious

308
00:30:23,970 -->  00:30:28,720
Ping I know you've done a bunch of these what
are the things you look for in an entrepreneur

309
00:30:28,720 -->  00:30:31,690
when you're willing to make a bet that seems
really out there.

310
00:30:31,690 -->  00:30:38,210
   PING LI: I think the non--- at least the
way we think about Accel the venture guys

311
00:30:38,210 -->  00:30:45,120
don't come up with the ideas. We never confuse
ourselves with the entrepreneurs. What we

312
00:30:45,120 -->  00:30:50,590
look for is for the entrepreneurs to provide
that inspiration it really is from going out

313
00:30:50,590 -->  00:30:54,440
and talking to as many entrepreneurs as you
can. The reason I'm at DEF CON isn't because

314
00:30:54,440 -->  00:31:00,970
I'm going to win any hack competition or anything
like that. It's because I can spend time with

315
00:31:00,970 -->  00:31:05,580
what I think are really smart people that
are thinking about things 10, 15 steps ahead

316
00:31:05,580 -->  00:31:10,679
of what I'm thinking about.
And our job as venture guys is just identify

317
00:31:10,679 -->  00:31:16,039
there's people that have those insights so
it's the really in some ways I always say

318
00:31:16,039 -->  00:31:21,740
the best entrepreneurs are the ones that convince
me that doing the impossible is actually possible

319
00:31:21,740 -->  00:31:26,259
because we sit there every day and see hundreds
of ideas and there's thousands of things wrong

320
00:31:26,259 -->  00:31:30,139
with the ideas but there's always one entrepreneur
that comes through the door for some reason

321
00:31:30,139 -->  00:31:36,309
every question you have him or her the answer
comes back in such a way like this guy might

322
00:31:36,309 -->  00:31:42,000
actually pull this off that's actually really
possible what he just said and no matter how

323
00:31:42,000 -->  00:31:46,860
you poke and prodded them they thought through
every single angle of the problem. I can't

324
00:31:46,860 -->  00:31:52,000
tell you how thoughtful the entrepreneurs
are that we back in whatever space they are

325
00:31:52,000 -->  00:31:55,909
in it could be big data clout security mobile
they have literally thought through every

326
00:31:55,909 -->  00:32:02,029
single possible permutation from the problem
from the customer angle to the business model

327
00:32:02,029 -->  00:32:07,840
every single angle that's what gives us conviction
not to say they have all the answers but thought

328
00:32:07,840 -->  00:32:13,080
through the problems and the questions that's
how we find ourselves backing entrepreneurs

329
00:32:13,080 -->  00:32:17,759
oftentimes in spaces we didn't have any idea
we knew anything about before we wrote for

330
00:32:17,759 -->  00:32:24,440
that entrepreneur.
   I would actually echo that. I joked earlier

331
00:32:24,440 -->  00:32:31,440
in the kids presentation where we're trying
to drive our investment level down to 9 year

332
00:32:32,129 -->  00:32:36,169
olds we're working hard on this.
   There's no law against that actually.

333
00:32:36,169 -->  00:32:43,169
   There isn't it's not child labor as long
as the LLC is in the mom or dad's name.

334
00:32:45,419 -->  00:32:52,350
(Applause).
   So kidding aside what I said there is I

335
00:32:52,350 -->  00:32:58,350
want entrepreneurs who will make me feel like
a moron. And by --> my wife would say that's

336
00:32:58,350 -->  00:33:02,620
actually not very hard. But --
(Chuckles).

337
00:33:02,620 -->  00:33:08,580
   What I would say is to Ping's point, you
can be in a meeting with an entrepreneur.

338
00:33:08,580 -->  00:33:15,320
And I've watched this process both at Accel
and in Andreessen Horowitz and in my own career

339
00:33:15,320 -->  00:33:22,320
in deals we have in common. The --> you think
you're being very clever, you know. The entrepreneurs

340
00:33:24,090 -->  00:33:31,090
I'll pick a fairly obtuse --> they do something
that involves zero knowledge proof maybe it's

341
00:33:31,799 -->  00:33:38,799
a hobby of yours maybe you read a couple of
articles about it IEE spectrum or --> you think

342
00:33:42,710 -->  00:33:47,860
you have actually caught this person out and
they are 9 steps ahead of you and by the way

343
00:33:47,860 -->  00:33:54,860
everything else that you ask, you have the
sense as the big baller --> as the big baller

344
00:33:55,169 -->  00:34:00,870
VC that you're a child that this person is
patiently explaining how the world really

345
00:34:00,870 -->  00:34:07,870
works and that's when as empirical as we try
to make VC that's when you get the gut feeling

346
00:34:09,010 -->  00:34:15,620
especially if the person is passionate and
engaged and driven about what they are doing

347
00:34:15,620 -->  00:34:21,400
that this is a human being that you can back.
That they have this combination of as Ping

348
00:34:21,400 -->  00:34:28,400
said all the answers. But the fire in the
belly to go through with it. And you know

349
00:34:29,960 -->  00:34:36,040
John, you come across as a fairly quiet guy.
But clearly you had the fire in the belly

350
00:34:36,040 -->  00:34:41,610
as well as all of the answers when Vinod stopped
you halfway through.

351
00:34:41,610 -->  00:34:48,610
I have one more thing is we're wrong all the
freaking time so to John's earlier point or

352
00:34:50,040 -->  00:34:57,040
his earlier story, you can't look at a VC
saying no. As a valid condemnation of your

353
00:35:00,640 -->  00:35:07,450
dream or objective or goals. You have to look
at it as a fallible human being or group of

354
00:35:07,450 -->  00:35:14,450
human beings with incomplete data making the
best literal guess that they can.

355
00:35:15,000 -->  00:35:19,470
And by the way, nos are good. I mean one of
the things that we pride ourselves on is no

356
00:35:19,470 -->  00:35:25,490
matter how crazy the idea, we will write a
couple of paragraphs that explain in detail

357
00:35:25,490 -->  00:35:29,840
our decision making for the no.
We never send an e-mail saying yeah it's just

358
00:35:29,840 -->  00:35:35,290
not a fit. All right. Check you later.
We say hey look you had this product flaw

359
00:35:35,290 -->  00:35:41,000
and we talked with the four customers you
asked us to they were lukewarm and you know

360
00:35:41,000 -->  00:35:46,480
you have 17 competitors. You only listed 4.
The market may be more crowded than you think.

361
00:35:46,480 -->  00:35:53,480
And a lot of the time we get a thank you instead
of an F you. Even when we say no. Because

362
00:35:54,640 -->  00:35:57,020
it's actually useful for the entrepreneur.
   This is the one conference you can actually

363
00:35:57,020 -->  00:35:58,920
say fuck on stage.
   Okay.

364
00:35:58,920 -->  00:36:03,130
   I've always wanted to do that I've done
it in a lot of --> I've been in a lot of panels

365
00:36:03,130 -->  00:36:10,130
the first time I can say fuck on a panel.
I just want to get that out.

366
00:36:10,660 -->  00:36:16,220
(Applause).
   I guess Ping is luckier because I've had

367
00:36:16,220 -->  00:36:21,350
entrepreneurs on occasion invent entirely
new mathematical symbologies to tell me how

368
00:36:21,350 -->  00:36:26,870
bad they wanted me to fuck myself.
(Chuckles).

369
00:36:26,870 -->  00:36:32,560
   But John is absolutely right. You can't
take a no as definitive. And I think when

370
00:36:32,560 -->  00:36:36,290
you do get a no the one piece of feedback
that I have for everybody in this room is

371
00:36:36,290 -->  00:36:43,290
demand --> demand the reasoning behind it.
And use it to go strengthen your pitch. And

372
00:36:45,040 -->  00:36:49,840
go see Vinod apparently he writes $5 million
checks in less than 30 minutes.

373
00:36:49,840 -->  00:36:53,260
   I think we have ten minutes left I want
to make sure we have time for Q&A there's

374
00:36:53,260 -->  00:36:58,370
two microphones there for those who want to
ask questions. We'll start over there.

375
00:36:58,370 -->  00:37:02,960
   So let's talk about the logistical process
of how you get started you've talked about

376
00:37:02,960 -->  00:37:08,480
it from a hypothetical but at what point are
people interacting with you is it when they

377
00:37:08,480 -->  00:37:12,600
have a full fledged product like a prototype
it will be different from hardware and software

378
00:37:12,600 -->  00:37:19,520
but let's talk about some of the logistics
of how they would interact with you to contact

379
00:37:19,520 -->  00:37:25,240
you guys.
   Well so from my personal experience not

380
00:37:25,240 -->  00:37:32,240
as a VC but as someone who started a company,
I don't think you need to wait at all. I think

381
00:37:34,910 -->  00:37:41,910
you can start building relationships with
VCs by you get introduced or you introduce

382
00:37:43,930 -->  00:37:49,630
yourself and you simply say I have a concept
I would like to talk to you about. Most VCs

383
00:37:49,630 -->  00:37:54,990
I think Ping said it earlier want to talk
to as many entrepreneurs as possible. And

384
00:37:54,990 -->  00:37:59,220
you can come in and say: I'm not ready to
raise money yet but I just want to test the

385
00:37:59,220 -->  00:38:06,220
waters with you with this kind of concept.
And good VCs will not only you know test the

386
00:38:06,720 -->  00:38:11,070
waters with you. But they will give you advice
about you know you're thinking about this

387
00:38:11,070 -->  00:38:16,740
right but have you thought about what your
co-founders would look like or you know one

388
00:38:16,740 -->  00:38:22,830
thing that I tend to tell a lot of people
is you can't just invent a product without

389
00:38:22,830 -->  00:38:28,140
thinking about how you're going to get that
product into customers hands early on. Like

390
00:38:28,140 -->  00:38:33,310
you don't want to build this huge monolithic
thing I'll give you an example that requires

391
00:38:33,310 -->  00:38:39,610
an appliance and an agent on every endpoint.
You know it's just not going to get sold.

392
00:38:39,610 -->  00:38:45,200
It may solve a problem. But it's --> no one
buys technology now that requires something

393
00:38:45,200 -->  00:38:50,620
implemented on every endpoint.
So yeah you don't need to wait. You can start

394
00:38:50,620 -->  00:38:55,630
the process he right away. And don't be afraid
that oh shit I didn't have a --

395
00:38:55,630 -->  00:39:00,859
   This is the place you can swear, right?
(Chuckles).

396
00:39:00,859 -->  00:39:05,100
   I didn't have a great meeting so now I
screwed my relationship with that particular

397
00:39:05,100 -->  00:39:09,880
VC. Not at all. If you did, then that VC is
not the right VC anyway.

398
00:39:09,880 -->  00:39:16,130
   On the left.
   Yeah. Hello. Okay. So here it is. You talk

399
00:39:16,130 -->  00:39:20,120
about the impossibility. So I'm from New Jersey
you've ever heard the expression Waste Management

400
00:39:20,120 -->  00:39:24,770
the guys from New Jersey what business are
you in Waste Management so I'm in the business

401
00:39:24,770 -->  00:39:30,930
of eliminating and killing and crushing foreign
adversaries for child pornography now that's

402
00:39:30,930 -->  00:39:37,660
an impossible attempt to go against foreign
adversaries organized crime figures people

403
00:39:37,660 -->  00:39:43,090
who actually don't want to actually step up
to the plate so I'm in the waste removal business.

404
00:39:43,090 -->  00:39:47,170
Something that nobody can say no to. Because
if you say no you're saying no to helping

405
00:39:47,170 -->  00:39:52,040
kids. Well I challenge the panel right here
right now I got the technology I got streaming

406
00:39:52,040 -->  00:39:57,140
data I got security I got everything you can
possibly imagine to get these people off the

407
00:39:57,140 -->  00:40:01,550
streets the Russians are making $8 billion
a year just in child pornography alone and

408
00:40:01,550 -->  00:40:07,550
selling it through cyber-security and other
areas under the radar so what do you guys

409
00:40:07,550 -->  00:40:11,030
think about addressing an issue that actually
collectively helps saves the youth of the

410
00:40:11,030 -->  00:40:14,330
nation that people say it's impossible to
do?

411
00:40:14,330 -->  00:40:19,380
   Who says it's impossible?
   Everybody says it's impossible to address

412
00:40:19,380 -->  00:40:22,600
this because nobody wants to address the issue
because of the ugliness of the intellectual

413
00:40:22,600 -->  00:40:26,860
property and the issue that goes along with
it nobody wants to stare at 80 million kids

414
00:40:26,860 -->  00:40:33,290
being raped and video alone nobody wants to
go through the process filter it decipher

415
00:40:33,290 -->  00:40:36,430
it and put it in the right position and remove
it and try to figure how to get it out of

416
00:40:36,430 -->  00:40:41,010
the hands of the people who didn't want to
have it or have it creep up on them either

417
00:40:41,010 -->  00:40:47,940
in social media or areas --
   Two comments, one it is sunnier in California.

418
00:40:47,940 -->  00:40:52,820
I think we got a better attitude about the
impossible than maybe the Secaucus so come

419
00:40:52,820 -->  00:40:59,820
visit the other ones I can't speak to my fellow
panelists I know some of them have tight schedules

420
00:41:00,810 -->  00:41:05,200
but I'll come and find you and I'll listen
for ten minutes to the impossible idea and

421
00:41:05,200 -->  00:41:08,890
give you the best advice I can.
   Any other opinion.

422
00:41:08,890 -->  00:41:15,260
   I'll be outside right afterwards.
   Is it just you or nobody else.

423
00:41:15,260 -->  00:41:18,510
   I have no idea what my colleagues can do
but I will step up.

424
00:41:18,510 -->  00:41:25,200
   Over here on the right.
   Yes. Hello. I'm an Internet Veteran he

425
00:41:25,200 -->  00:41:31,160
from decades back and my question is when
are ideas too big for you guys to be interested

426
00:41:31,160 -->  00:41:36,580
in I heard earlier on you talked about CipherCloud
or something like that well I come from maybe

427
00:41:36,580 -->  00:41:41,490
a slightly alternate universe from this crowd,
from the standards fields and there's this

428
00:41:41,490 -->  00:41:46,200
-- gone through this multiple times in the
past but currently there's something called

429
00:41:46,200 -->  00:41:53,200
DNS Seq could be applied for lots of security
maybe eating some securities lunch as well

430
00:41:54,280 -->  00:41:59,660
when I'm looking for interest in investors
not to make money myself but to make this

431
00:41:59,660 -->  00:42:06,660
stuff happen I get well Rick that's a big
play that's too big that's too rich and so

432
00:42:08,480 -->  00:42:12,410
you were talking about looking for the --> I
understand maybe it's one out of ten then

433
00:42:12,410 -->  00:42:17,360
you're doing good if you're successful risk
is not something you're afraid of but I would

434
00:42:17,360 -->  00:42:23,620
like to get one sentence short little response
about when is something not appealing at all

435
00:42:23,620 -->  00:42:30,620
to you guys thanks.
   I couldn't hear everything but just in

436
00:42:31,300 -->  00:42:36,890
your question about when is something too
big. There really isn't anything too big when

437
00:42:36,890 -->  00:42:41,590
you have --> when you're in the venture capital
business we're about finding big opportunities

438
00:42:41,590 -->  00:42:47,340
the thing I would think about with your particular
opportunity is to actually break the problem

439
00:42:47,340 -->  00:42:53,110
down into smaller pieces don't try to solve
the end state right from the beginning. I

440
00:42:53,110 -->  00:43:00,110
think a lot of entrepreneurs see the end state
but the market or the industry may not be

441
00:43:00,270 -->  00:43:05,270
as far along as where you want it to be so
one of the failure modes we've seen in a lot

442
00:43:05,270 -->  00:43:10,780
of companies is being too early to a market
and just making sure that you align yourselves

443
00:43:10,780 -->  00:43:15,120
up with market realities. And it will play
out over time sometimes things take longer

444
00:43:15,120 -->  00:43:19,140
or they take a path that's slightly different
so the end state is usually bigger than what

445
00:43:19,140 -->  00:43:23,610
anyone images but how you get there sometimes
is very different I think a lot of people

446
00:43:23,610 -->  00:43:30,090
try to do the big thing first.
So be patient I guess.

447
00:43:30,090 -->  00:43:35,610
   Great, thanks. Over here.
   So I'm one of these people that has an

448
00:43:35,610 -->  00:43:40,510
idea. I'm not ready to come to venture capital
yet and because what I'm working on is too

449
00:43:40,510 -->  00:43:47,510
factor authentication behavior and bio in
one fell swoop I'll need to put an endpoint

450
00:43:47,580 -->  00:43:53,330
on every --> and appliance on every endpoint
unfortunately that's just the nature of the

451
00:43:53,330 -->  00:43:57,780
beast. It's required software and hardware.
The hardware has been invented but not in

452
00:43:57,780 -->  00:44:02,570
the right size. And the software somebody
good could program it that's not me.

453
00:44:02,570 -->  00:44:07,120
How do I get it to a point where I can bring
it to somebody to get some money so I can

454
00:44:07,120 -->  00:44:11,730
hire to build the hardware the size I need
it and do the programming because I don't

455
00:44:11,730 -->  00:44:15,420
have the money how do I get it to a point
where I can get some help.

456
00:44:15,420 -->  00:44:22,100
   You can come today and we can talk about
it. And I'm sure the --> to an earlier point

457
00:44:22,100 -->  00:44:27,040
here, it's okay to go to VCs before you are
ready, before the product is in the market

458
00:44:27,040 -->  00:44:32,270
so we can give you advice on what we have
seen on how to bring these products to market.

459
00:44:32,270 -->  00:44:35,089
   I'm assuming I need to have you sign an
NDA.

460
00:44:35,089 -->  00:44:38,650
   We don't do that.
   We normally don't sign NDAs.

461
00:44:38,650 -->  00:44:42,910
   Maybe I can chime in here.
   Okay.

462
00:44:42,910 -->  00:44:49,910
   A couple of things, one, the only purpose
of an NDA that you can argue for actually

463
00:44:52,400 -->  00:44:59,350
in the first to file patent regime which would
be to protect --> protect you from future claims

464
00:44:59,350 -->  00:45:04,100
by somebody that you had ex pod your information
in public and therefore you couldn't patent

465
00:45:04,100 -->  00:45:08,730
it. As it turns out, if you're talking to
somebody about financing your company, there's

466
00:45:08,730 -->  00:45:14,070
an exemption in the law for that that applies
internationally. So you're not jeopardizing

467
00:45:14,070 -->  00:45:19,120
your patents by talking to a VC under first
to file.

468
00:45:19,120 -->  00:45:25,670
And VCs can't sign NDAs because all it takes
is a small handful of people filing nuisance

469
00:45:25,670 -->  00:45:32,670
lawsuits and not our money but our time is
then so consumed in that kind of litigious

470
00:45:33,720 -->  00:45:40,720
regime VCs would stop investing in promising
young companies so to achieve herd immunity

471
00:45:45,090 -->  00:45:49,940
not signing NDAs is a form of vaccination
as far as what you want to do even if it's

472
00:45:49,940 -->  00:45:54,300
not the right thing for the VC there's kick
starter and a whole bunch of other crowd funding

473
00:45:54,300 -->  00:46:01,300
stuff there's AngelList we know the guys well
there we are actually investors in that platform.

474
00:46:02,700 -->  00:46:08,270
That's an awesome way of getting like minded
people to back you and I don't know exactly

475
00:46:08,270 -->  00:46:14,400
what you're doing but if you showed up and
said you know and said I have something that

476
00:46:14,400 -->  00:46:20,970
plugs into a USB port or works over low powered
Bluetooth next generation laptops and I can

477
00:46:20,970 -->  00:46:27,690
provide bullet proof authenticatable security
locked to an individual human being.

478
00:46:27,690 -->  00:46:34,690
Maybe that's my sign-in for you know my true
crypt. I can unlock true crypt with your gizmo.

479
00:46:35,890 -->  00:46:41,890
   You're right with me, keep going.
   There's half a million dollars of human

480
00:46:41,890 -->  00:46:46,740
beings interested in that on AngelList or
kick starter without a huge amount of effort

481
00:46:46,740 -->  00:46:50,230
so I say go for it.
   Matt is going to write you a $5 million

482
00:46:50,230 -->  00:46:54,970
check right now congratulations.
   You need another 30 minutes before I write

483
00:46:54,970 -->  00:46:57,260
you the $5 million check.
   I'll make the time.

484
00:46:57,260 -->  00:47:01,260
   Unfortunately, we're out of time but I
know the panelists will probably be up here

485
00:47:01,260 -->  00:47:04,430
for questions anyone who does have questions
just come up and grab the panelists after.

486
00:47:04,430 -->  00:47:05,800
So let's thank everyone. I appreciate it.
(Applause)
