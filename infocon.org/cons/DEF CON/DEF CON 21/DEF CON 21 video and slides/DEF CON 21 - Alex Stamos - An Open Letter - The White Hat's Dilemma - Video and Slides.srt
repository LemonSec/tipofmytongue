1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
ALEX STAMOS: Everybody,

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,334
the Penn and Teller theater.

3
00:00:07,501 --> 00:00:08,709
My name is Alex Stamos.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,375
I'm here to talk about the ethics

5
00:00:12,375 --> 00:00:14,999
Yeah, so, if you're here

6
00:00:14,999 --> 00:00:16,626
now is the time to go.

7
00:00:18,083 --> 00:00:21,834
So a couple this is supposed

8
00:00:21,834 --> 00:00:25,375
We kicked around a couple ideas,

9
00:00:25,459 --> 00:00:29,999
Could be me dousing my career

10
00:00:30,417 --> 00:00:32,792
Could be a lot of outcomes.

11
00:00:34,626 --> 00:00:37,999
One disclaimer I'm here personally,

12
00:00:37,999 --> 00:00:39,417
up here.

13
00:00:39,542 --> 00:00:42,999
If you're a reporter or are going

14
00:00:42,999 --> 00:00:45,999
or something, just say Alex Stamos

15
00:00:45,999 --> 00:00:48,792
dashingly handsome citizen,

16
00:00:48,792 --> 00:00:52,042
the corporate people not know I'm here.

17
00:00:53,125 --> 00:00:55,959
This is going to be

18
00:00:55,959 --> 00:01:00,751
interactive means not screaming

19
00:01:00,751 --> 00:01:03,999
We have specific interactive points

20
00:01:03,999 --> 00:01:07,999
from you guys so I'm hoping to kick

21
00:01:07,999 --> 00:01:11,334
in over the next couple years,

22
00:01:11,334 --> 00:01:14,501
of where we live in interesting times.

23
00:01:15,751 --> 00:01:18,918
We're going to talk

24
00:01:18,918 --> 00:01:22,751
to think about us as an industry

25
00:01:22,751 --> 00:01:24,959
within the industry.

26
00:01:24,999 --> 00:01:27,125
And then I think

27
00:01:27,125 --> 00:01:29,375
is I'm going

28
00:01:29,375 --> 00:01:33,834
and we're all going to vote

29
00:01:33,959 --> 00:01:35,959
So this is an open discussion space,

30
00:01:35,959 --> 00:01:38,667
with very different backgrounds

31
00:01:38,667 --> 00:01:41,792
about what's going

32
00:01:41,792 --> 00:01:44,876
I just hope everybody is responsive,

33
00:01:44,876 --> 00:01:47,834
to each other

34
00:01:47,834 --> 00:01:49,459
should be.

35
00:01:49,459 --> 00:01:52,834
We're going to talk

36
00:01:52,834 --> 00:01:54,209
You don't have to applaud let.

37
00:01:54,209 --> 00:01:55,375
I'm like Dan Kominski.

38
00:01:55,375 --> 00:01:56,375
I'll stop.

39
00:01:56,375 --> 00:01:58,125
And you can see your applause point.

40
00:02:00,999 --> 00:02:06,167
I'm not here to put moral framework

41
00:02:06,167 --> 00:02:07,083
It's for you

42
00:02:07,083 --> 00:02:09,501
from so you understand my biases.

43
00:02:11,375 --> 00:02:14,999
My first DEF CON many years ago

44
00:02:14,999 --> 00:02:18,167
the hotel room

45
00:02:18,626 --> 00:02:21,125
Like many people I was self taught.

46
00:02:21,125 --> 00:02:22,083
As a teenager,

47
00:02:22,083 --> 00:02:24,292
of what I mean by self taught.

48
00:02:25,459 --> 00:02:30,083
I worked after defensive roles

49
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:31,999
I started

50
00:02:31,999 --> 00:02:33,834
worked out well.

51
00:02:34,999 --> 00:02:37,999
One of the best parts of my career

52
00:02:37,999 --> 00:02:41,542
with fantastic people and give fantastic

53
00:02:41,542 --> 00:02:43,417
into the industry.

54
00:02:43,417 --> 00:02:45,626
That's one of the things I'm most proud

55
00:02:45,709 --> 00:02:48,375
As part of that job, I've worked

56
00:02:48,375 --> 00:02:50,999
an I've seen what it's like to be

57
00:02:50,999 --> 00:02:54,959
of a nation state who wants

58
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:57,375
I've been asked to do stuff for the U.S.

59
00:02:57,375 --> 00:02:59,375
government and I've helped in the past.

60
00:02:59,959 --> 00:03:02,751
I have been to places

61
00:03:02,751 --> 00:03:05,667
those who ironed your shirts

62
00:03:05,667 --> 00:03:08,751
will understand where those locations

63
00:03:10,292 --> 00:03:14,292
And my work has put

64
00:03:14,292 --> 00:03:15,999
So I'm just trying to be honest

65
00:03:15,999 --> 00:03:18,292
about where I'm coming

66
00:03:18,292 --> 00:03:21,709
of the DEF CON crowd I'm

67
00:03:24,667 --> 00:03:27,709
I'm a corporate white hat sellout.

68
00:03:27,709 --> 00:03:29,584
This talk about is about the ethics

69
00:03:29,584 --> 00:03:31,792
a sellout how you can do so.

70
00:03:32,876 --> 00:03:37,959
If you're an anarchist or anti info sec

71
00:03:37,959 --> 00:03:43,876
but realize you're not going

72
00:03:43,876 --> 00:03:47,584
So I've been doing this for a while now.

73
00:03:47,876 --> 00:03:50,834
In the last couple years I've had

74
00:03:50,999 --> 00:03:52,918
Like it used to be easy

75
00:03:52,918 --> 00:03:54,876
to get into security.

76
00:03:54,876 --> 00:03:55,999
It was something fun.

77
00:03:55,999 --> 00:03:58,542
It was something you could get paid

78
00:03:58,542 --> 00:04:00,375
Things you would usually do for free.

79
00:04:00,375 --> 00:04:03,375
And that's how a lot of us slipped

80
00:04:03,375 --> 00:04:06,792
these days you need you need

81
00:04:06,792 --> 00:04:10,459
goal and this has come

82
00:04:10,876 --> 00:04:12,999
We live in interesting times.

83
00:04:12,999 --> 00:04:17,125
Good old days there's only one good

84
00:04:17,125 --> 00:04:19,751
Do you want to be on the white hat

85
00:04:21,083 --> 00:04:23,375
Everybody likes to break things.

86
00:04:23,375 --> 00:04:25,584
Everybody likes to look

87
00:04:25,584 --> 00:04:28,375
out how it works and tear it apart.

88
00:04:28,375 --> 00:04:31,083
If you're on the black hat side,

89
00:04:31,083 --> 00:04:34,250
for personal gain, you use it

90
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:37,626
to get your shoutouts to your friends.

91
00:04:37,999 --> 00:04:40,792
Or you use it for some kind

92
00:04:40,999 --> 00:04:42,959
If you're a white hat,

93
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:45,999
to make that system better

94
00:04:46,083 --> 00:04:46,918
And you might disagree

95
00:04:46,918 --> 00:04:48,999
but that's what I'm going to use today.

96
00:04:48,999 --> 00:04:50,292
It used to not be that hard.

97
00:04:50,292 --> 00:04:54,584
You could pick one or another

98
00:04:54,834 --> 00:04:56,918
But the definition is simple.

99
00:04:56,999 --> 00:04:59,999
There's a lot of ways to be

100
00:04:59,999 --> 00:05:02,501
You can work for corporate

101
00:05:02,501 --> 00:05:06,083
as a small group of folks,

102
00:05:06,083 --> 00:05:10,375
or getting consulting contracts

103
00:05:10,375 --> 00:05:14,999
with their parents, there's a number

104
00:05:14,999 --> 00:05:17,334
and stay independent.

105
00:05:17,334 --> 00:05:19,209
You can be a consultant

106
00:05:19,209 --> 00:05:21,751
is the environment

107
00:05:21,751 --> 00:05:25,751
an academic, there are a lot of ways

108
00:05:25,918 --> 00:05:29,501
But back in the late night '90s,

109
00:05:33,876 --> 00:05:37,999
It seems like we were children fighting

110
00:05:37,999 --> 00:05:39,999
full disclosure.

111
00:05:40,167 --> 00:05:43,709
The goal of the responsible

112
00:05:43,709 --> 00:05:46,125
I've got a bug, I want to protect

113
00:05:46,125 --> 00:05:49,999
from this bug, what is the best way

114
00:05:50,167 --> 00:05:55,083
It's still an open discussion

115
00:05:55,083 --> 00:05:58,417
Because it 201 he 3

116
00:05:58,417 --> 00:06:02,876
the same outline of why they go

117
00:06:02,876 --> 00:06:06,209
It assumes everybody wants

118
00:06:06,375 --> 00:06:07,792
Also back

119
00:06:07,792 --> 00:06:10,834
a company wasn't that difficult.

120
00:06:10,834 --> 00:06:12,999
Some people didn't want to work

121
00:06:12,999 --> 00:06:16,083
in a world where a lot

122
00:06:16,083 --> 00:06:19,250
on both sides of the fence,

123
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:21,167
DEF CON,

124
00:06:21,167 --> 00:06:26,083
at the same time they're selling tools

125
00:06:26,083 --> 00:06:28,501
Not just in developing countries

126
00:06:28,501 --> 00:06:30,999
and other western countries.

127
00:06:31,334 --> 00:06:34,459
Back in that day we had little interaction

128
00:06:34,459 --> 00:06:35,626
So, if you were obviously

129
00:06:35,626 --> 00:06:38,083
you would interact

130
00:06:38,083 --> 00:06:41,999
but you could go your entire career

131
00:06:41,999 --> 00:06:45,417
to 2003 and never have to talk

132
00:06:45,417 --> 00:06:49,751
about just what you're doing

133
00:06:49,751 --> 00:06:51,501
That's obviously not true any more.

134
00:06:51,501 --> 00:06:53,417
And there's a lot of gray hat activity.

135
00:06:53,417 --> 00:06:56,125
A lot of people chose

136
00:06:56,125 --> 00:06:57,292
But a lot was harmless.

137
00:06:57,292 --> 00:06:58,959
A lot of people I know holding

138
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:02,999
of the past making them feel young

139
00:07:02,999 --> 00:07:07,542
or doing something cool but a lot

140
00:07:07,542 --> 00:07:12,167
malicious so it didn't compete too much

141
00:07:12,459 --> 00:07:14,334
So what changed?

142
00:07:14,334 --> 00:07:16,999
A lot of people ask when

143
00:07:16,999 --> 00:07:19,584
When am I getting my fucking robot

144
00:07:20,167 --> 00:07:23,626
And you know, it turns

145
00:07:23,626 --> 00:07:27,209
of different ways, we live

146
00:07:27,209 --> 00:07:30,083
Gibson, Sterling and

147
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:32,083
about in the '80.

148
00:07:32,334 --> 00:07:36,250
That's amazing, sci fi authors

149
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:40,083
but the guys

150
00:07:40,209 --> 00:07:43,709
We're in a world with corporate

151
00:07:43,709 --> 00:07:47,334
to corporate info warfare

152
00:07:47,375 --> 00:07:51,999
That's a normal part of our lives

153
00:07:51,999 --> 00:07:56,250
somewhat paid for by nation state

154
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:59,250
and steal secrets, which

155
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:04,876
up out of William Gibson novels

156
00:08:05,209 --> 00:08:08,709
We live in a world where our country,

157
00:08:08,709 --> 00:08:10,999
with semi autonomous robots.

158
00:08:10,999 --> 00:08:12,542
I'm not kill people.

159
00:08:12,542 --> 00:08:14,834
I'm just saying James Cameron, way

160
00:08:14,834 --> 00:08:20,417
you really called that one much quicker

161
00:08:20,876 --> 00:08:22,999
We don't make them look

162
00:08:22,999 --> 00:08:25,542
a bipedal titanium robot

163
00:08:25,542 --> 00:08:27,626
to build a killer robot.

164
00:08:27,626 --> 00:08:31,083
Or make them look

165
00:08:31,083 --> 00:08:33,334
They're made more cheaper

166
00:08:35,584 --> 00:08:39,250
We live in a world where

167
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:44,334
on a massive data surveillance

168
00:08:44,334 --> 00:08:47,792
Preventing criminal activities

169
00:08:47,792 --> 00:08:50,792
by looking at Internet traffic.

170
00:08:51,167 --> 00:08:52,999
And I wish any of these things was

171
00:08:52,999 --> 00:08:56,334
about I don't think anybody here thinks

172
00:08:57,999 --> 00:09:00,167
What are fun things that happened.

173
00:09:00,209 --> 00:09:02,125
We have Stuxnet and flame.

174
00:09:02,292 --> 00:09:04,876
I'm sure most people have heard

175
00:09:04,876 --> 00:09:05,999
Those are pieces

176
00:09:05,999 --> 00:09:09,501
against the Islamic Republic of Iran.

177
00:09:09,709 --> 00:09:11,999
I'm not going

178
00:09:11,999 --> 00:09:15,125
at any governments that were related

179
00:09:15,125 --> 00:09:18,751
a feel who might have been involved

180
00:09:18,751 --> 00:09:21,083
And I feel this is kind

181
00:09:21,083 --> 00:09:24,542
of the no more free bugs movement

182
00:09:24,542 --> 00:09:29,417
a an open marketplace that didn't exist

183
00:09:29,417 --> 00:09:34,334
weaponize it and whoever

184
00:09:34,999 --> 00:09:37,999
We live in a world where cyber war

185
00:09:37,999 --> 00:09:41,542
Almost any corporation

186
00:09:41,542 --> 00:09:46,999
of threat that you only played

187
00:09:46,999 --> 00:09:49,999
in 2003,

188
00:09:49,999 --> 00:09:56,125
and people building planes

189
00:09:56,334 --> 00:09:59,584
Last year I did a project

190
00:09:59,584 --> 00:10:00,584
Right?

191
00:10:00,709 --> 00:10:04,125
They've got a dozen IT guys,

192
00:10:04,125 --> 00:10:06,334
job it

193
00:10:06,334 --> 00:10:09,626
and you're like well who cares

194
00:10:09,626 --> 00:10:12,626
Well, they employ tens of thousands

195
00:10:12,626 --> 00:10:16,000
of dollars of heavy industry and

196
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,250
in places like China.

197
00:10:18,626 --> 00:10:22,751
And so, if you just happened to be

198
00:10:22,751 --> 00:10:27,459
then you're going to end up at a level

199
00:10:27,459 --> 00:10:30,667
unimaginable a couple years ago.

200
00:10:30,709 --> 00:10:33,167
And what's really scary from that

201
00:10:33,167 --> 00:10:35,999
for a company that size

202
00:10:35,999 --> 00:10:38,000
to protect themselves.

203
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,292
Like the people doing the best

204
00:10:39,292 --> 00:10:41,876
against the Chinese right now

205
00:10:41,999 --> 00:10:44,250
Google has like 150 security people.

206
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:46,083
They've got windows kernel experts.

207
00:10:46,083 --> 00:10:47,250
OS10 kernel experts.

208
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:50,542
They have an intelligence team.

209
00:10:50,834 --> 00:10:53,999
They're not winning,

210
00:10:54,209 --> 00:10:59,918
So tractor company is fucked,

211
00:10:59,918 --> 00:11:02,167
(Laughter) And this

212
00:11:05,209 --> 00:11:07,876
Isn't capitalism what the world

213
00:11:08,083 --> 00:11:09,626
And competition.

214
00:11:09,626 --> 00:11:10,792
I want to get

215
00:11:10,792 --> 00:11:12,667
the interactive part is.

216
00:11:16,667 --> 00:11:18,584
I just want to have enough time.

217
00:11:20,792 --> 00:11:25,334
We live in a world when companies are

218
00:11:25,334 --> 00:11:30,999
Those looking at flame,

219
00:11:30,999 --> 00:11:35,167
out they don't sell those much.

220
00:11:35,167 --> 00:11:38,083
You can't call them and say can I sign

221
00:11:38,626 --> 00:11:41,999
You have to steal that from them

222
00:11:41,999 --> 00:11:46,083
an entirely new way doing

223
00:11:46,083 --> 00:11:49,501
been used before in open literature

224
00:11:49,501 --> 00:11:54,083
a couple millisecond window

225
00:11:54,083 --> 00:11:57,999
license certificate authority

226
00:11:57,999 --> 00:12:02,209
an identical MB5 sub

227
00:12:02,626 --> 00:12:06,083
This is the equivalent

228
00:12:06,083 --> 00:12:08,709
with $10 million

229
00:12:08,709 --> 00:12:11,459
of cyanide would have done it.

230
00:12:11,584 --> 00:12:14,667
This tells you something

231
00:12:15,375 --> 00:12:17,375
This is basically the U.S.

232
00:12:17,375 --> 00:12:19,876
government being like oh, yeah, yeah,

233
00:12:19,876 --> 00:12:20,876
Boom.

234
00:12:20,876 --> 00:12:21,876
Drop mic.

235
00:12:21,876 --> 00:12:23,417
What are you going to do about it?

236
00:12:23,417 --> 00:12:24,417
Right?

237
00:12:24,417 --> 00:12:24,751
(Laughter) It's

238
00:12:24,751 --> 00:12:26,125
with radioactive material.

239
00:12:26,125 --> 00:12:28,083
You could just shoot

240
00:12:28,083 --> 00:12:30,167
saved $9,985,000.

241
00:12:33,375 --> 00:12:38,667
That's by the entire pack

242
00:12:38,667 --> 00:12:40,626
Instead they thought we're going

243
00:12:40,626 --> 00:12:42,417
material over London.

244
00:12:42,417 --> 00:12:44,125
This is the cyber wary equivalent.

245
00:12:44,501 --> 00:12:48,667
Whoever wrote Flame was willing

246
00:12:48,667 --> 00:12:51,876
actual attack against Microsoft.

247
00:12:52,167 --> 00:12:54,334
What does that make you feel

248
00:12:54,334 --> 00:12:56,959
and you have all this relationship

249
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:59,375
of the world where you're trying

250
00:12:59,375 --> 00:13:01,999
and you're trying to work with them

251
00:13:01,999 --> 00:13:04,584
about your products and by the way,

252
00:13:04,584 --> 00:13:06,999
on the defense side, somebody

253
00:13:06,999 --> 00:13:10,667
like it's open season

254
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:15,876
We live in a world where these cyber

255
00:13:15,876 --> 00:13:17,834
another blogger.

256
00:13:17,834 --> 00:13:19,751
And I forget exactly who made

257
00:13:19,751 --> 00:13:21,999
a gun at somebody,

258
00:13:21,999 --> 00:13:24,250
out and throw it back at you.

259
00:13:24,626 --> 00:13:27,751
But, if you throw a rock

260
00:13:27,751 --> 00:13:31,125
them, they're going to throw

261
00:13:31,751 --> 00:13:34,876
Using the word cyber without irony

262
00:13:34,876 --> 00:13:36,999
in an info sec communities.

263
00:13:37,999 --> 00:13:39,918
But that seems to be

264
00:13:39,918 --> 00:13:41,209
these days.

265
00:13:41,751 --> 00:13:44,083
These cyber weapons are

266
00:13:44,125 --> 00:13:46,999
For the short period of time

267
00:13:46,999 --> 00:13:50,542
about several critical bugs

268
00:13:50,542 --> 00:13:53,626
controller is United States

269
00:13:53,626 --> 00:13:57,751
if Iran who paid attention

270
00:13:57,751 --> 00:14:00,292
God this guy's Finnish

271
00:14:00,292 --> 00:14:03,999
the other folks who have been finding

272
00:14:03,999 --> 00:14:06,792
in the wild had any other kind

273
00:14:06,792 --> 00:14:11,334
from a society where they're totally

274
00:14:11,334 --> 00:14:14,459
we very well could have seen these

275
00:14:14,459 --> 00:14:19,999
against all the companies we work

276
00:14:20,501 --> 00:14:22,751
So it brings up a question

277
00:14:22,751 --> 00:14:25,209
against cyber war,

278
00:14:25,209 --> 00:14:27,209
who's buying them.

279
00:14:27,209 --> 00:14:28,959
Offensive or defensive teams.

280
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:30,918
I've never heard

281
00:14:30,918 --> 00:14:33,167
in the way they knew.

282
00:14:33,375 --> 00:14:35,999
There was

283
00:14:35,999 --> 00:14:37,999
that could buy it.

284
00:14:37,999 --> 00:14:39,459
What are they doing with them?

285
00:14:39,459 --> 00:14:41,667
Using it for foreign use

286
00:14:41,876 --> 00:14:45,292
An what goals are being accomplished

287
00:14:45,292 --> 00:14:48,083
about when you sell bugs

288
00:14:48,083 --> 00:14:51,083
the nation's goal or government

289
00:14:51,083 --> 00:14:54,501
at that moment that are being

290
00:14:54,501 --> 00:14:55,334
And if want to know what

291
00:14:55,334 --> 00:14:57,584
is between nation's goal

292
00:14:57,584 --> 00:14:59,999
I see people with white pony tails,

293
00:14:59,999 --> 00:15:02,417
about a man named Richard Nixon

294
00:15:02,417 --> 00:15:04,417
to you what happened.

295
00:15:06,083 --> 00:15:08,959
So we also have a world not

296
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:12,125
and Justice Department and

297
00:15:12,125 --> 00:15:14,959
a real problem in our world

298
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:19,250
between prosecution and persecution

299
00:15:19,459 --> 00:15:23,584
For example, there's a lot

300
00:15:23,584 --> 00:15:28,125
from their bosses, which is as old

301
00:15:28,125 --> 00:15:32,083
and taken their customer lists

302
00:15:32,083 --> 00:15:35,125
And this is why we have NDAs, this

303
00:15:35,125 --> 00:15:38,083
This is why we have civil lawsuits

304
00:15:38,083 --> 00:15:41,999
have stolen their trade secrets

305
00:15:41,999 --> 00:15:44,999
people as criminals using

306
00:15:44,999 --> 00:15:48,999
of 1996 because it happens to be

307
00:15:49,083 --> 00:15:51,876
20 years ago if you walked

308
00:15:51,876 --> 00:15:54,999
you would have gotten sued

309
00:15:54,999 --> 00:15:58,626
have had to give it back

310
00:15:58,626 --> 00:16:00,083
These days if you have

311
00:16:00,083 --> 00:16:03,751
on a USB drive that turns you

312
00:16:03,751 --> 00:16:06,792
like these guys,

313
00:16:06,792 --> 00:16:08,999
rap at Goldman Sachs.

314
00:16:16,083 --> 00:16:18,959
Argwal, who left

315
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:20,959
secrets with them.

316
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:23,083
I don't think they should walk

317
00:16:23,083 --> 00:16:25,876
those hedge funds to make money

318
00:16:25,876 --> 00:16:27,999
a national security issue.

319
00:16:27,999 --> 00:16:28,999
This

320
00:16:28,999 --> 00:16:31,999
between these folks that now

321
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:34,999
the soul crushing power

322
00:16:34,999 --> 00:16:38,501
of Justice is being turned

323
00:16:38,501 --> 00:16:40,626
And then of course we know

324
00:16:40,626 --> 00:16:43,501
and Abuse Act people

325
00:16:43,501 --> 00:16:44,999
data out.

326
00:16:45,501 --> 00:16:48,584
I don't consider him

327
00:16:48,584 --> 00:16:52,125
But I don't think he deserves to be

328
00:16:52,751 --> 00:16:56,667
Lori drew, again, not a nice person.

329
00:16:56,667 --> 00:16:59,709
I don't want to hang out with her,

330
00:16:59,709 --> 00:17:02,250
the myspace terms of service

331
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:05,751
and Aaron Schwartz, the elephant

332
00:17:06,792 --> 00:17:12,083
So where I come to this

333
00:17:12,083 --> 00:17:13,501
Like I said,

334
00:17:13,501 --> 00:17:17,292
times in the prosecution

335
00:17:17,999 --> 00:17:20,918
And these were

336
00:17:20,918 --> 00:17:24,083
like stole a book or something like that.

337
00:17:24,501 --> 00:17:27,751
So you know, as part of my penance,

338
00:17:27,751 --> 00:17:30,751
of pro bono work

339
00:17:30,751 --> 00:17:34,999
my company provided pro bono work

340
00:17:34,999 --> 00:17:38,459
of Sony doing everything possible

341
00:17:38,459 --> 00:17:40,999
in a meeting

342
00:17:40,999 --> 00:17:44,626
a real estate lawyer and

343
00:17:44,626 --> 00:17:46,626
at Internet law.

344
00:17:46,626 --> 00:17:48,918
Okay, that's great.

345
00:17:48,918 --> 00:17:51,792
Maybe if my life is at stake,

346
00:17:51,792 --> 00:17:54,125
But it's like him,

347
00:17:54,125 --> 00:17:58,083
about the case but came just

348
00:17:58,083 --> 00:18:01,292
of the table and me,

349
00:18:01,292 --> 00:18:05,999
is four big law partners who almost

350
00:18:05,999 --> 00:18:09,250
an hour to sit there across from us.

351
00:18:09,751 --> 00:18:14,501
And this is because a guy was able

352
00:18:14,501 --> 00:18:17,876
Sony is willing to bury us in paper.

353
00:18:18,083 --> 00:18:19,959
And obviously that happens.

354
00:18:19,999 --> 00:18:21,999
There's not a lot we can do

355
00:18:21,999 --> 00:18:25,999
on Aaron Schwartz's case

356
00:18:27,375 --> 00:18:30,959
Part of my job for the defense was

357
00:18:30,959 --> 00:18:34,334
the prosecution's expert created

358
00:18:34,334 --> 00:18:37,083
is or what company he worked for.

359
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:38,999
I don't think he did anything wrong.

360
00:18:38,999 --> 00:18:40,999
This is a guy who worked

361
00:18:40,999 --> 00:18:44,209
company who was approached

362
00:18:44,209 --> 00:18:47,083
on those machine and tell us what

363
00:18:47,083 --> 00:18:50,792
a reasonable workman, like,

364
00:18:50,792 --> 00:18:52,999
ands I found this in the logs

365
00:18:52,999 --> 00:18:56,417
like he changes his Mac address

366
00:18:56,918 --> 00:18:59,999
We had a couple things to hit him

367
00:18:59,999 --> 00:19:01,459
He didn't lie.

368
00:19:01,459 --> 00:19:04,876
He didn't make things

369
00:19:04,876 --> 00:19:04,876
S.

370
00:19:04,876 --> 00:19:07,626
attorney's office and twisted

371
00:19:07,626 --> 00:19:11,083
to turn into Aaron Swartz was

372
00:19:12,501 --> 00:19:16,709
And, if I was him,

373
00:19:16,709 --> 00:19:22,083
been unitized in a way to persecute

374
00:19:25,501 --> 00:19:27,792
What is our role here?

375
00:19:27,792 --> 00:19:31,083
Is our role as technical experts

376
00:19:31,083 --> 00:19:33,876
job to make sure justice is done

377
00:19:33,876 --> 00:19:37,459
a more active requirement

378
00:19:37,459 --> 00:19:39,834
in the technical world?

379
00:19:39,999 --> 00:19:41,834
And obviously we have

380
00:19:41,834 --> 00:19:46,918
all the crazy people basically everything

381
00:19:46,918 --> 00:19:49,542
I apologize,

382
00:19:49,542 --> 00:19:54,792
with like a at a DEF CON party,

383
00:19:54,792 --> 00:19:57,792
that's really interesting.

384
00:19:57,792 --> 00:20:01,999
I got to go.

385
00:20:01,999 --> 00:20:02,999
I got to talk.

386
00:20:02,999 --> 00:20:07,584
All those people were right, which

387
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,167
A lot of people suspected this was

388
00:20:17,501 --> 00:20:20,250
This is from the Washington Post.

389
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:24,999
You don't have to read it too closely,

390
00:20:26,918 --> 00:20:29,250
We suspected it's different than

391
00:20:29,375 --> 00:20:33,292
The reason that's important

392
00:20:33,292 --> 00:20:34,709
Who here has heard of that?

393
00:20:35,167 --> 00:20:38,834
A couple Poli Sci majors.

394
00:20:38,999 --> 00:20:40,667
There's this guy,

395
00:20:40,667 --> 00:20:44,375
is a political science major who came

396
00:20:44,375 --> 00:20:47,918
the most important thing

397
00:20:47,918 --> 00:20:50,334
is whether it's considered

398
00:20:50,334 --> 00:20:52,834
of acceptable discourse.

399
00:20:52,834 --> 00:20:53,834
Right?

400
00:20:53,834 --> 00:20:55,834
So he talks a lot about the need

401
00:20:55,834 --> 00:20:57,834
to have radicals.

402
00:20:57,834 --> 00:21:00,125
So for example,

403
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:03,334
is a radical whose ideas were not

404
00:21:03,334 --> 00:21:06,501
by a couple percentage points

405
00:21:06,501 --> 00:21:08,918
the effect of being

406
00:21:08,918 --> 00:21:11,959
of the window and therefore,

407
00:21:11,959 --> 00:21:14,999
of what was acceptable political

408
00:21:14,999 --> 00:21:17,999
in which Martin Luther King

409
00:21:17,999 --> 00:21:21,999
in and be considered again

410
00:21:22,209 --> 00:21:25,083
I think what's interesting

411
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:30,501
is from a conspiracy perspective,

412
00:21:30,501 --> 00:21:32,792
So this was

413
00:21:32,792 --> 00:21:34,834
I knew the U.S.

414
00:21:34,834 --> 00:21:38,083
government was making malware

415
00:21:38,083 --> 00:21:39,876
I have no moral problem with that.

416
00:21:39,876 --> 00:21:41,709
I have no moral problem with Stuxnet.

417
00:21:41,709 --> 00:21:43,542
If you're the President

418
00:21:43,542 --> 00:21:46,083
to you and say sir,

419
00:21:46,083 --> 00:21:48,417
a bunch

420
00:21:48,417 --> 00:21:52,459
says that we'll probably kill you know

421
00:21:52,459 --> 00:21:55,959
to be children or I can use a virus

422
00:21:55,959 --> 00:21:59,709
obviously the moral choice

423
00:21:59,709 --> 00:22:02,167
Where it gets difficult

424
00:22:02,167 --> 00:22:06,918
to make sure other people are protected

425
00:22:06,918 --> 00:22:08,459
to you go?

426
00:22:08,459 --> 00:22:09,417
It's one thing to do

427
00:22:09,417 --> 00:22:11,167
with the Iranian government

428
00:22:11,167 --> 00:22:13,751
the agricultural department

429
00:22:13,751 --> 00:22:17,918
and now it's agricultural Department

430
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:21,167
There's a continuum we have

431
00:22:23,876 --> 00:22:27,918
Clearly well knew there was widespread

432
00:22:28,209 --> 00:22:32,999
The fact that every fiberoptic cable

433
00:22:32,999 --> 00:22:35,584
to break every six months,

434
00:22:35,584 --> 00:22:39,167
the Greek and Filipino captains

435
00:22:39,167 --> 00:22:43,459
through there have been drinking too

436
00:22:43,459 --> 00:22:47,999
the Filipino drink of choice

437
00:22:47,999 --> 00:22:51,999
and you do a tap

438
00:22:51,999 --> 00:22:55,584
good and able to get

439
00:22:55,584 --> 00:22:58,999
out of sawed Saudi Arabia or Iran.

440
00:23:01,417 --> 00:23:04,918
I thought there was malware

441
00:23:04,918 --> 00:23:07,999
in a while mobile devices are used.

442
00:23:08,501 --> 00:23:11,709
There's a slight possibility

443
00:23:11,709 --> 00:23:14,667
all of us living through this,

444
00:23:14,667 --> 00:23:17,167
because we know for a fact that stuff

445
00:23:17,167 --> 00:23:21,417
is happening and we know

446
00:23:21,417 --> 00:23:24,375
sniffing happens so it expands our

447
00:23:24,375 --> 00:23:28,209
is a possible something that we'll

448
00:23:28,209 --> 00:23:30,667
I'm now willing to discuss

449
00:23:30,667 --> 00:23:33,626
the NSA has knows how

450
00:23:33,626 --> 00:23:36,626
because they have

451
00:23:36,626 --> 00:23:40,709
for the discreet time

452
00:23:43,667 --> 00:23:46,417
Now I gave a talk about it

453
00:23:46,417 --> 00:23:50,083
before I would have thought that's

454
00:23:51,417 --> 00:23:52,999
If it turns

455
00:23:52,999 --> 00:23:56,876
and Bono still does not age,

456
00:23:59,709 --> 00:24:02,584
Isn't it an exciting time to be

457
00:24:02,626 --> 00:24:05,417
Those exciting times we have

458
00:24:05,417 --> 00:24:08,709
and thoughtful decisions of how we act.

459
00:24:10,125 --> 00:24:13,083
How do we make sense

460
00:24:13,083 --> 00:24:16,792
We're born with only basic moral

461
00:24:16,792 --> 00:24:19,209
I'm not going to get into ethical

462
00:24:19,209 --> 00:24:20,667
I was an engineering major.

463
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:23,501
You're willing to take

464
00:24:23,501 --> 00:24:28,792
without me participating,

465
00:24:29,083 --> 00:24:32,584
We're born with the most basic,

466
00:24:32,584 --> 00:24:35,626
is and that can be overridden

467
00:24:35,626 --> 00:24:39,292
as every atrocity

468
00:24:39,709 --> 00:24:41,667
You can make humans do everything

469
00:24:41,667 --> 00:24:43,876
they were doing something right.

470
00:24:43,876 --> 00:24:45,250
I was only following orders being

471
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:47,083
over and over again.

472
00:24:47,792 --> 00:24:50,334
We make decisions

473
00:24:50,334 --> 00:24:52,125
friends, society.

474
00:24:54,083 --> 00:24:56,209
If you want

475
00:24:56,209 --> 00:24:59,667
important to think

476
00:24:59,667 --> 00:25:02,876
Why do I feel this way and do I choose

477
00:25:02,876 --> 00:25:06,751
or am I going to leave it

478
00:25:07,792 --> 00:25:10,542
Frameworks patriotism

479
00:25:10,751 --> 00:25:13,083
Two words that don't exactly mean

480
00:25:13,083 --> 00:25:17,834
but can find 40,000 word treaties

481
00:25:17,999 --> 00:25:19,918
I'm not going to apologize.

482
00:25:19,918 --> 00:25:21,999
I'm American, I'm proud to be

483
00:25:21,999 --> 00:25:23,999
I'm the grandson

484
00:25:23,999 --> 00:25:26,999
to get to this country

485
00:25:26,999 --> 00:25:29,417
from kind

486
00:25:29,417 --> 00:25:32,999
on the side of a mountain

487
00:25:32,999 --> 00:25:35,083
of conditions, right?

488
00:25:35,918 --> 00:25:38,626
My great grandfather came here and

489
00:25:38,626 --> 00:25:41,167
and he's now you're General Stamos.

490
00:25:42,626 --> 00:25:44,999
He's like I love America!

491
00:25:46,459 --> 00:25:48,999
And when you come

492
00:25:48,999 --> 00:25:51,999
of you who understand that understand

493
00:25:51,999 --> 00:25:54,417
down because he busted his ass

494
00:25:54,417 --> 00:25:56,083
for six months so

495
00:25:56,083 --> 00:25:58,250
and do something great.

496
00:25:58,250 --> 00:25:59,999
So that's why I had

497
00:25:59,999 --> 00:26:02,999
out of school in 5th grade, came here.

498
00:26:02,999 --> 00:26:03,999
U.S.

499
00:26:03,999 --> 00:26:04,999
Army took him.

500
00:26:04,999 --> 00:26:07,667
You don't speak English, great,

501
00:26:09,999 --> 00:26:13,792
Learns English in the Army

502
00:26:13,792 --> 00:26:17,501
to do electrical engineering classes

503
00:26:17,501 --> 00:26:20,959
of a huge engineering team at Pac Bell.

504
00:26:20,999 --> 00:26:24,375
And that's like something that's pretty

505
00:26:24,375 --> 00:26:25,999
So I want to be proud of my country.

506
00:26:25,999 --> 00:26:27,209
But what does that mean?

507
00:26:27,209 --> 00:26:28,209
Right?

508
00:26:28,209 --> 00:26:29,999
Which of these is the United States?

509
00:26:29,999 --> 00:26:31,209
Is it the dirt we live on?

510
00:26:31,209 --> 00:26:34,250
Obviously the dirt that comprises

511
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:38,999
all the time since 1776 and

512
00:26:39,125 --> 00:26:40,709
And you he no, I don't think

513
00:26:40,709 --> 00:26:42,999
to be massively different

514
00:26:42,999 --> 00:26:44,918
in the next couple years.

515
00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:47,876
Is it the government that currently

516
00:26:47,876 --> 00:26:49,792
No, these people work for us.

517
00:26:49,792 --> 00:26:50,792
Right?

518
00:26:50,792 --> 00:26:51,999
I have no loyalty to them.

519
00:26:51,999 --> 00:26:54,083
Their loyalty is to me as a citizen.

520
00:26:54,083 --> 00:26:57,250
I don't think we have any loyalty

521
00:26:57,250 --> 00:26:58,999
I think it's really stupid to put

522
00:26:58,999 --> 00:27:00,792
at the post office.

523
00:27:00,834 --> 00:27:03,375
He should have our faces on his wall.

524
00:27:03,375 --> 00:27:05,083
That's how that works!

525
00:27:07,626 --> 00:27:09,918
(Laughter) Is it the citizenry?

526
00:27:09,918 --> 00:27:11,999
I am proud of fellow Americans.

527
00:27:14,999 --> 00:27:17,626
If you live in Japan, you're proud

528
00:27:17,626 --> 00:27:20,417
that means you're proud

529
00:27:20,417 --> 00:27:23,417
existed for thousands of years

530
00:27:23,417 --> 00:27:26,292
of Americans, you're proud

531
00:27:26,292 --> 00:27:29,125
an American citizen in the last year?

532
00:27:29,542 --> 00:27:30,834
Right.

533
00:27:30,834 --> 00:27:33,626
You guys have just as American

534
00:27:33,626 --> 00:27:35,083
And I'm proud of you guys, too.

535
00:27:35,083 --> 00:27:38,876
So saying you're proud

536
00:27:39,125 --> 00:27:42,083
I'm proud of the idea, right?

537
00:27:42,626 --> 00:27:44,709
The idea of limited government.

538
00:27:44,709 --> 00:27:46,667
The idea of us not trusting government.

539
00:27:46,667 --> 00:27:48,918
The idea if you read

540
00:27:48,918 --> 00:27:52,999
the founders were actually crazy anti

541
00:27:52,999 --> 00:27:56,167
What they realize

542
00:27:56,167 --> 00:28:01,792
into systems that give them power,

543
00:28:01,792 --> 00:28:05,918
to act against the interests of people.

544
00:28:05,918 --> 00:28:06,709
That's why we created

545
00:28:06,709 --> 00:28:10,083
with three parts fighting each other

546
00:28:10,083 --> 00:28:13,375
beings, even

547
00:28:13,375 --> 00:28:16,334
And I don't think the guys doing

548
00:28:16,334 --> 00:28:18,167
government right now are bad people.

549
00:28:18,167 --> 00:28:19,834
So I got dinner

550
00:28:19,834 --> 00:28:24,584
a couple nights ago the night

551
00:28:24,584 --> 00:28:28,667
I didn't know I was going to go

552
00:28:28,667 --> 00:28:30,999
One of the memories I'll take

553
00:28:30,999 --> 00:28:34,334
is Jennifer granite grilling him

554
00:28:34,334 --> 00:28:37,083
over a nice blackened cod.

555
00:28:37,083 --> 00:28:38,083
It was great.

556
00:28:38,501 --> 00:28:41,918
And watching Jennifer take it

557
00:28:41,918 --> 00:28:43,876
really enjoyable.

558
00:28:43,876 --> 00:28:44,876
Right?

559
00:28:45,083 --> 00:28:49,834
(Laughter) So General Alexander,

560
00:28:49,834 --> 00:28:54,209
a big part of his thing is I really want

561
00:28:54,209 --> 00:28:57,709
but where he's coming

562
00:28:57,709 --> 00:29:00,459
during the Euroslavian war.

563
00:29:01,334 --> 00:29:06,667
Don't overestimate how much cohesion

564
00:29:07,083 --> 00:29:10,083
Any society can fall apart

565
00:29:10,959 --> 00:29:15,709
If that kind of attack happens again,

566
00:29:17,999 --> 00:29:22,584
But, if that kind of thing happens again,

567
00:29:27,167 --> 00:29:31,417
He feels he's a good guy and has

568
00:29:31,417 --> 00:29:35,083
a framing that allows him

569
00:29:35,083 --> 00:29:38,584
up to performing military coup.

570
00:29:39,083 --> 00:29:41,999
If your framing

571
00:29:41,999 --> 00:29:44,876
to destroy the constitution

572
00:29:44,876 --> 00:29:47,999
will do almost anything

573
00:29:47,999 --> 00:29:49,999
important my oath

574
00:29:49,999 --> 00:29:52,083
of the United States.

575
00:29:52,083 --> 00:29:53,501
I think this is not

576
00:29:53,501 --> 00:29:56,626
to make your moral decisions

577
00:29:56,626 --> 00:30:00,250
or nationalism but snubbed

578
00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:03,709
in the scope of the people or

579
00:30:03,709 --> 00:30:06,999
up of fallible people that make

580
00:30:07,667 --> 00:30:10,876
Another way you've got to think

581
00:30:10,876 --> 00:30:13,417
the only group you 0 responsible to.

582
00:30:13,417 --> 00:30:17,125
We have a hierarchy

583
00:30:17,125 --> 00:30:19,501
The core of that for me personally

584
00:30:19,501 --> 00:30:20,792
I've got three kids.

585
00:30:20,792 --> 00:30:23,667
I chose with my wife to bring them

586
00:30:23,667 --> 00:30:24,959
They didn't choose that.

587
00:30:24,959 --> 00:30:27,292
I have a responsibility for them

588
00:30:27,292 --> 00:30:29,417
That responsibilities drops

589
00:30:29,417 --> 00:30:31,083
to kick them out.

590
00:30:31,083 --> 00:30:32,501
But I still have

591
00:30:32,501 --> 00:30:35,751
for the creatures I brought

592
00:30:35,751 --> 00:30:36,999
Who here is a parent.

593
00:30:37,584 --> 00:30:39,501
Everybody understands that.

594
00:30:39,626 --> 00:30:43,709
You hear that when you're 23, fuck, you,

595
00:30:44,542 --> 00:30:48,209
But you live through it

596
00:30:48,209 --> 00:30:53,209
of your responsibility and has

597
00:30:53,209 --> 00:30:56,000
So in the short term there's decisions

598
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,999
Ed Snowden would not have done what

599
00:30:59,459 --> 00:31:01,626
He would have orphaned them.

600
00:31:01,709 --> 00:31:05,375
I cannot do what he did ever

601
00:31:05,375 --> 00:31:09,751
to my family that overrides any other

602
00:31:09,751 --> 00:31:11,542
would happen.

603
00:31:11,918 --> 00:31:13,918
Unfortunately, this responsibility

604
00:31:13,918 --> 00:31:17,501
of totalitarian societies have turned

605
00:31:17,751 --> 00:31:20,334
But that's a responsibility you have

606
00:31:22,501 --> 00:31:24,542
You have a responsibility to friends,

607
00:31:24,542 --> 00:31:26,334
the colleagues you happen to work

608
00:31:26,334 --> 00:31:27,999
the employees you hire turns

609
00:31:27,999 --> 00:31:30,167
an interesting world conundrum.

610
00:31:30,792 --> 00:31:34,709
When you hire somebody you're

611
00:31:34,709 --> 00:31:40,999
I'm going to pay you twice a month,

612
00:31:41,417 --> 00:31:43,709
I offered you a job that was

613
00:31:43,709 --> 00:31:47,167
and I'm not going

614
00:31:47,167 --> 00:31:49,375
That's something you have

615
00:31:50,626 --> 00:31:55,083
When you're a small business owner,

616
00:31:55,083 --> 00:31:59,167
this is your job and you're going

617
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:02,584
might not make payroll and you realize

618
00:32:02,584 --> 00:32:06,792
50 people who might not make rent

619
00:32:06,792 --> 00:32:09,250
need to do for those folks.

620
00:32:09,292 --> 00:32:11,876
You might feel an obligation

621
00:32:11,876 --> 00:32:13,250
That was the kind

622
00:32:13,250 --> 00:32:15,542
for our grandfather's time.

623
00:32:15,542 --> 00:32:16,292
I'm not going

624
00:32:16,292 --> 00:32:18,459
of them didn't have corporate jobs.

625
00:32:19,876 --> 00:32:21,584
You go and work, you spend 50 years,

626
00:32:21,584 --> 00:32:24,083
the gold watch has changed a little bit.

627
00:32:24,167 --> 00:32:25,250
Other societies.

628
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:26,083
Not so much

629
00:32:26,083 --> 00:32:28,709
of tribes people have responsibility to.

630
00:32:28,999 --> 00:32:30,834
Tribes that existed much longer than

631
00:32:30,834 --> 00:32:33,834
the British people happened

632
00:32:34,083 --> 00:32:36,083
Our society or civilization.

633
00:32:36,584 --> 00:32:39,125
There's a sci fi author who likes

634
00:32:39,125 --> 00:32:42,999
of a civilization that he's proud

635
00:32:42,999 --> 00:32:45,375
is an interesting argument.

636
00:32:45,542 --> 00:32:47,626
Our nation and our species.

637
00:32:48,250 --> 00:32:51,584
This is not

638
00:32:51,584 --> 00:32:54,250
Clearly if your friend kills somebody

639
00:32:54,250 --> 00:32:56,959
is a dangerous person,

640
00:32:56,959 --> 00:33:01,542
to your society overrode your

641
00:33:01,542 --> 00:33:02,167
Although I don't know a lot

642
00:33:02,167 --> 00:33:04,459
in their kids no matter what happened?

643
00:33:04,709 --> 00:33:07,876
How many kids would turn their kid

644
00:33:08,083 --> 00:33:09,292
Almost nobody.

645
00:33:09,292 --> 00:33:10,292
You did?

646
00:33:10,292 --> 00:33:11,292
Okay.

647
00:33:11,292 --> 00:33:14,334
Are you Robert Moore Moore senior

648
00:33:14,334 --> 00:33:17,667
So I thought he wouldn't be here

649
00:33:21,250 --> 00:33:24,375
We haven't talked about this

650
00:33:24,375 --> 00:33:28,999
the idea that there would be universal

651
00:33:28,999 --> 00:33:32,626
There's Hippocrates and

652
00:33:32,626 --> 00:33:33,999
They have an oath of lasagna.

653
00:33:34,999 --> 00:33:38,459
It's funny but literally

654
00:33:38,459 --> 00:33:40,083
a new oath.

655
00:33:44,417 --> 00:33:47,751
Medicine are the scientific priests.

656
00:33:51,083 --> 00:33:54,375
Scientific priests used observation

657
00:33:54,375 --> 00:33:59,709
to make people better and that put them

658
00:33:59,709 --> 00:34:03,125
gave them some kind of responsibility.

659
00:34:03,584 --> 00:34:07,125
We're the technological priesthood

660
00:34:09,834 --> 00:34:13,209
Everybody here has fixed their family's

661
00:34:13,209 --> 00:34:15,083
reminds you

662
00:34:15,083 --> 00:34:18,709
of the world that underlies our day

663
00:34:18,709 --> 00:34:20,999
of people do not understand.

664
00:34:21,083 --> 00:34:22,083
We do.

665
00:34:22,501 --> 00:34:25,999
Maybe that gives us moral obligation

666
00:34:27,959 --> 00:34:31,209
All people discover their technology

667
00:34:31,292 --> 00:34:33,999
This would be equivalent

668
00:34:33,999 --> 00:34:38,501
in Geneva Conventions if you are go

669
00:34:38,501 --> 00:34:43,751
to be treated just as was as well

670
00:34:44,542 --> 00:34:47,834
Doctors will risk their lives to save

671
00:34:47,834 --> 00:34:51,209
of people their coworkers just shot.

672
00:34:54,083 --> 00:34:56,584
We don't have that kind of thing

673
00:34:56,584 --> 00:34:58,292
But maybe we need to have that.

674
00:34:58,834 --> 00:35:00,667
The idea that the Internet is used

675
00:35:00,667 --> 00:35:03,626
of oppression rather than liberation.

676
00:35:03,626 --> 00:35:05,918
This is dangerous,

677
00:35:05,918 --> 00:35:09,999
to be liberated from the oppression

678
00:35:09,999 --> 00:35:13,999
all the children from the porn,

679
00:35:13,999 --> 00:35:18,501
in a way that can be oppressive itself,

680
00:35:18,501 --> 00:35:22,375
at least you're not going

681
00:35:24,209 --> 00:35:29,999
If you start to go down the ethics,

682
00:35:29,999 --> 00:35:35,999
in a famous paper neither our distance

683
00:35:35,999 --> 00:35:40,542
of people in respects to that evil

684
00:35:40,542 --> 00:35:45,209
as we lessens that ability

685
00:35:45,459 --> 00:35:47,792
He's saying

686
00:35:47,792 --> 00:35:51,709
for not doing something right

687
00:35:51,709 --> 00:35:55,999
or it's physically far away are bullshit

688
00:35:55,999 --> 00:35:59,125
He was making this argument

689
00:35:59,125 --> 00:36:03,918
He was saying who likes it there are

690
00:36:03,999 --> 00:36:06,959
Everybody wants every child

691
00:36:06,959 --> 00:36:10,709
Therefore, if you don't take every dollar

692
00:36:10,709 --> 00:36:13,876
to feed your own children

693
00:36:13,876 --> 00:36:16,292
you're morally repugnant.

694
00:36:16,542 --> 00:36:18,999
You have fallen short

695
00:36:18,999 --> 00:36:21,667
That's a crazy argument that

696
00:36:21,667 --> 00:36:25,417
society would fall apart as we

697
00:36:25,417 --> 00:36:28,792
and there's no idea of a consumer

698
00:36:28,792 --> 00:36:31,334
of thing when you think

699
00:36:31,334 --> 00:36:36,999
of ethics that people have gotten

700
00:36:36,999 --> 00:36:39,999
We're not going to hit it

701
00:36:39,999 --> 00:36:41,999
Another reason is personal legacy.

702
00:36:42,125 --> 00:36:45,083
Some say I'm reducing human

703
00:36:45,083 --> 00:36:47,167
economic benefits.

704
00:36:47,959 --> 00:36:50,751
A lot of people laughed when

705
00:36:50,751 --> 00:36:53,375
doing God's work which I thought was

706
00:36:53,375 --> 00:36:55,542
he honestly believes it.

707
00:36:56,292 --> 00:36:58,999
One of the great things

708
00:36:58,999 --> 00:37:01,125
of people rising out of poverty

709
00:37:01,125 --> 00:37:05,083
because of us shipping them bags

710
00:37:05,083 --> 00:37:07,751
It's because they were able

711
00:37:07,751 --> 00:37:12,209
to sell goods and services that

712
00:37:18,667 --> 00:37:21,999
The guy who started Tata motors took

713
00:37:21,999 --> 00:37:25,125
out in the fields and were

714
00:37:25,125 --> 00:37:27,209
reasonably good jobs.

715
00:37:27,209 --> 00:37:29,083
That's an argument some people have.

716
00:37:29,125 --> 00:37:30,918
Making your own family wealthy.

717
00:37:31,083 --> 00:37:32,959
Building something that lasts.

718
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:35,292
If you study engineering,

719
00:37:35,292 --> 00:37:37,709
the idea

720
00:37:37,709 --> 00:37:40,209
they're gone the work lives on.

721
00:37:40,999 --> 00:37:43,792
That's building

722
00:37:44,667 --> 00:37:47,959
So something to think about though

723
00:37:47,959 --> 00:37:50,542
down and think

724
00:37:50,542 --> 00:37:53,083
that means you're rich and lucky.

725
00:37:53,083 --> 00:37:54,834
Because the vast majority

726
00:37:54,834 --> 00:37:56,876
they can do

727
00:37:56,876 --> 00:37:59,501
to feed in their family and friends.

728
00:37:59,501 --> 00:38:00,999
The rest

729
00:38:00,999 --> 00:38:03,459
forget about the fact that when we talk

730
00:38:03,459 --> 00:38:05,999
because we have the ability to do so.

731
00:38:05,999 --> 00:38:10,999
Here we're going to get

732
00:38:10,999 --> 00:38:12,250
By fun, probably not fun.

733
00:38:13,083 --> 00:38:15,626
So the way I'm going to do this

734
00:38:15,626 --> 00:38:19,626
up ethical conundrums

735
00:38:19,626 --> 00:38:21,667
I'm going to read the conundrum

736
00:38:21,667 --> 00:38:24,542
please don't hoot and holler

737
00:38:24,542 --> 00:38:26,667
You can laugh if it's funny.

738
00:38:28,542 --> 00:38:30,792
Let's be respectful of each other.

739
00:38:30,999 --> 00:38:35,501
I'm going to poll the audience

740
00:38:35,501 --> 00:38:39,083
This is supposed to be a safe space,

741
00:38:42,375 --> 00:38:45,542
Would be really easy for us

742
00:38:45,542 --> 00:38:48,292
to the hardest anarchist side.

743
00:38:51,083 --> 00:38:54,209
If everybody in here acting that way,

744
00:38:54,209 --> 00:38:56,667
in the problem it is right now.

745
00:38:56,667 --> 00:38:59,125
So let's be honest

746
00:39:00,083 --> 00:39:02,083
Who here played Ultima 4.

747
00:39:02,375 --> 00:39:04,083
Old people.

748
00:39:05,167 --> 00:39:08,501
1985, first video game that basically

749
00:39:08,501 --> 00:39:11,999
the way you generated your character

750
00:39:11,999 --> 00:39:14,834
and you'd make a decision

751
00:39:14,834 --> 00:39:16,250
out of it.

752
00:39:16,292 --> 00:39:19,209
First time you did it you answered them

753
00:39:19,209 --> 00:39:21,167
and got a cheat sheet.

754
00:39:21,999 --> 00:39:25,083
And for a while it was

755
00:39:25,083 --> 00:39:26,918
go through.

756
00:39:26,918 --> 00:39:28,417
So that's what we're doing here.

757
00:39:29,083 --> 00:39:30,918
First question.

758
00:39:31,250 --> 00:39:32,542
Warmup question.

759
00:39:32,999 --> 00:39:36,250
You find a critical remote exploit

760
00:39:36,250 --> 00:39:37,250
What do you do?

761
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:39,834
Do you publicly announce

762
00:39:39,834 --> 00:39:40,876
Public disclosure.

763
00:39:41,083 --> 00:39:43,334
You wait and build

764
00:39:45,542 --> 00:39:47,999
Perform responsible disclosure

765
00:39:47,999 --> 00:39:52,542
to what you consider reasonable

766
00:39:52,959 --> 00:39:55,167
D, you use it

767
00:39:55,167 --> 00:39:57,125
to sell consulting.

768
00:39:57,667 --> 00:39:59,999
You're laughing but it happens

769
00:40:00,125 --> 00:40:03,000
E, you weaponize it and sell it directly

770
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,999
know is going to give it

771
00:40:06,167 --> 00:40:09,667
F, you weaponize it and sell it

772
00:40:09,667 --> 00:40:13,250
that's going to go after that

773
00:40:13,250 --> 00:40:13,792
than E.

774
00:40:13,792 --> 00:40:16,250
Use it for fun or profit.

775
00:40:16,375 --> 00:40:16,959
Who would do A.

776
00:40:16,959 --> 00:40:19,999
Only two full disclosure people.

777
00:40:20,999 --> 00:40:23,918
B, build a black hat talk.

778
00:40:23,999 --> 00:40:25,209
Okay, excellent.

779
00:40:25,584 --> 00:40:28,083
C, perform responsible disclosure

780
00:40:28,083 --> 00:40:29,626
Wow, awesome.

781
00:40:29,999 --> 00:40:30,999
D?

782
00:40:31,751 --> 00:40:33,626
Okay, excellent.

783
00:40:33,626 --> 00:40:34,999
I know you who you are.

784
00:40:34,999 --> 00:40:39,000
E, you'd weaponize and sell it

785
00:40:39,334 --> 00:40:44,876
F, weaponize it and just sell it and G,

786
00:40:45,667 --> 00:40:47,250
Decent number of people.

787
00:40:47,375 --> 00:40:48,375
That's fine.

788
00:40:48,375 --> 00:40:50,709
It seems like disclosure crowd.

789
00:40:50,999 --> 00:40:53,999
That's my answer, C guy.

790
00:40:56,250 --> 00:40:58,417
Your job

791
00:40:58,417 --> 00:41:00,792
you successfully uncover

792
00:41:00,792 --> 00:41:02,999
like an actual break in.

793
00:41:02,999 --> 00:41:06,250
Not a stupid violation and figure

794
00:41:06,250 --> 00:41:10,792
for the company full time or contractor,

795
00:41:10,792 --> 00:41:12,999
You write a report give it

796
00:41:12,999 --> 00:41:14,584
to the U.S.

797
00:41:14,792 --> 00:41:16,792
Attorney and you find

798
00:41:16,792 --> 00:41:18,709
for extreme penalties.

799
00:41:18,709 --> 00:41:21,209
Whatever it is,

800
00:41:22,209 --> 00:41:24,999
Do you A say I'm adjusting go

801
00:41:24,999 --> 00:41:27,167
to assist the prosecution.

802
00:41:27,209 --> 00:41:31,751
It's there is an adversarial process here

803
00:41:31,999 --> 00:41:35,959
B, you do nothing, try to stay

804
00:41:35,959 --> 00:41:36,999
You've done your part.

805
00:41:37,250 --> 00:41:40,083
C, you gently work

806
00:41:40,083 --> 00:41:43,250
but you don't do anything past that.

807
00:41:43,417 --> 00:41:46,125
D, you outright say I'm not going

808
00:41:46,125 --> 00:41:47,751
You cannot put me on the stand.

809
00:41:47,751 --> 00:41:49,167
Do not call me again.

810
00:41:49,375 --> 00:41:52,709
E, you call the defense and volunteer

811
00:41:52,709 --> 00:41:55,584
This may or may not be legal

812
00:41:55,999 --> 00:41:57,083
You can ask Kurt.

813
00:41:58,209 --> 00:42:05,375
You publicly take a stand,

814
00:42:05,375 --> 00:42:08,959
that protects witness.

815
00:42:08,959 --> 00:42:11,999
Whenever you do expert witness stuff,

816
00:42:11,999 --> 00:42:17,250
fuck you federal judge, I'm going

817
00:42:17,334 --> 00:42:22,918
A is a hard 1

818
00:42:27,209 --> 00:42:31,209
B, C gently work

819
00:42:31,959 --> 00:42:33,667
Largest so far.

820
00:42:33,751 --> 00:42:36,501
D outright refuse to participate.

821
00:42:37,417 --> 00:42:39,959
E, volunteer to the defense.

822
00:42:40,417 --> 00:42:43,584
And then F, go nuclear on Twitter.

823
00:42:45,125 --> 00:42:46,250
Okay.

824
00:42:46,250 --> 00:42:50,167
So I think it was C or D in a lot

825
00:42:50,417 --> 00:42:52,417
That's actually where I am personally.

826
00:42:52,417 --> 00:42:52,999
Somewhere between C and D.

827
00:42:52,999 --> 00:42:56,083
In just am I little bit

828
00:42:56,083 --> 00:43:00,459
off a federal judge is a world

829
00:43:00,459 --> 00:43:03,999
I'm not going to put my kids

830
00:43:04,125 --> 00:43:07,834
Volunteering for the defense

831
00:43:07,834 --> 00:43:10,918
what you guys said, which is good.

832
00:43:10,918 --> 00:43:12,125
You're approached by a member

833
00:43:12,125 --> 00:43:14,209
apparatus in a fend friendly matter.

834
00:43:17,501 --> 00:43:20,125
You haven't done anything wrong,

835
00:43:20,125 --> 00:43:21,999
this is just a chat.

836
00:43:22,083 --> 00:43:27,083
Do you A say yeah, let's go grab a beer,

837
00:43:27,083 --> 00:43:31,584
the girl thing and slip them

838
00:43:33,459 --> 00:43:36,667
C, say feel free to send me

839
00:43:36,667 --> 00:43:41,334
by e mail or we can set up a time

840
00:43:41,667 --> 00:43:46,209
D (Laughter) Or E.

841
00:43:46,209 --> 00:43:48,751
Okay.

842
00:43:53,584 --> 00:43:55,667
So A, who would do A?

843
00:43:55,667 --> 00:43:56,667
Take the meeting?

844
00:43:56,999 --> 00:43:58,083
Decent number of people.

845
00:43:58,083 --> 00:43:59,999
Probably about a quarter of the room.

846
00:43:59,999 --> 00:44:01,626
B, politely try to get out of it.

847
00:44:01,626 --> 00:44:02,834
More than a few women.

848
00:44:02,999 --> 00:44:03,999
I understand that.

849
00:44:04,125 --> 00:44:04,999
C.

850
00:44:04,999 --> 00:44:07,209
D?

851
00:44:07,876 --> 00:44:08,167
And E.

852
00:44:08,167 --> 00:44:12,375
Let's hear you're weaving, sir,

853
00:44:12,876 --> 00:44:15,167
So here's one I have to admit.

854
00:44:15,167 --> 00:44:16,626
I did A, people

855
00:44:16,626 --> 00:44:19,542
a beer, we'd love to hear

856
00:44:22,083 --> 00:44:24,709
I bought them beers and we sat

857
00:44:24,709 --> 00:44:27,999
for two hours and talked

858
00:44:27,999 --> 00:44:31,626
But this year no, I'd be a C,

859
00:44:31,626 --> 00:44:33,999
isolate ourselves.

860
00:44:33,999 --> 00:44:34,876
I don't think we need

861
00:44:34,876 --> 00:44:37,292
I'll never talk to anybody

862
00:44:37,292 --> 00:44:38,709
Because that kind

863
00:44:38,709 --> 00:44:40,250
to educate them.

864
00:44:40,250 --> 00:44:41,792
Again, they work for us.

865
00:44:44,999 --> 00:44:47,999
But especially

866
00:44:47,999 --> 00:44:51,918
with somebody who works

867
00:44:51,918 --> 00:44:56,959
the tiniest little mistake could be

868
00:44:56,999 --> 00:44:58,999
And so I don't think we're

869
00:44:58,999 --> 00:45:01,626
of us can interact

870
00:45:01,626 --> 00:45:04,501
in any way without attorneys present.

871
00:45:04,501 --> 00:45:05,501
It's just not safe.

872
00:45:05,501 --> 00:45:06,501
Okay.

873
00:45:06,501 --> 00:45:08,667
We'll do this a little more quickly.

874
00:45:08,667 --> 00:45:10,542
You work for respected cloud company.

875
00:45:10,542 --> 00:45:13,250
Course of duties you find a back door,

876
00:45:13,250 --> 00:45:16,999
without giving you any more

877
00:45:16,999 --> 00:45:19,125
Do you drop it, escalate

878
00:45:19,125 --> 00:45:22,999
for a new jock, publicly quit or pull

879
00:45:24,918 --> 00:45:25,999
Okay.

880
00:45:35,083 --> 00:45:37,334
Yeah, I mean, I'm probably

881
00:45:37,334 --> 00:45:39,292
on what I think the enforceable

882
00:45:39,292 --> 00:45:41,959
whether there's criminal penalties.

883
00:45:42,083 --> 00:45:44,834
I'm hoping people at Google feel

884
00:45:45,584 --> 00:45:48,125
You work

885
00:45:48,125 --> 00:45:50,167
Your boss hands you an order

886
00:45:50,167 --> 00:45:52,125
from the government.

887
00:45:52,999 --> 00:45:56,584
That is considered legal

888
00:45:56,584 --> 00:46:00,167
Do you comply and just forget drinking

889
00:46:00,459 --> 00:46:02,167
B, refuse

890
00:46:02,167 --> 00:46:04,209
going to do it you have

891
00:46:04,209 --> 00:46:06,083
but do nothing else.

892
00:46:06,375 --> 00:46:08,959
C, quietly look for a new job.

893
00:46:09,999 --> 00:46:15,209
D, publicly quit in protest,

894
00:46:15,459 --> 00:46:18,083
Or E, I would be happy to do that sir,

895
00:46:18,083 --> 00:46:21,250
of us using hardware security module,

896
00:46:21,250 --> 00:46:23,667
and somebody

897
00:46:23,667 --> 00:46:26,083
and our implementation

898
00:46:26,083 --> 00:46:28,959
me doing this

899
00:46:28,959 --> 00:46:30,417
you'll like.

900
00:46:30,417 --> 00:46:31,334
Please decide whether or not you'd

901
00:46:31,334 --> 00:46:34,501
to proceed now that I'm informed you

902
00:46:34,501 --> 00:46:37,167
to the world that you've asked me

903
00:46:37,876 --> 00:46:41,542
So obviously I'm telling you E

904
00:46:41,542 --> 00:46:48,999
(Applause.) But E requires forethought.

905
00:46:48,999 --> 00:46:50,584
So that's why I brought this up.

906
00:46:51,584 --> 00:46:56,167
If there's a backup key

907
00:46:57,083 --> 00:47:00,417
I'm building a service for people

908
00:47:00,876 --> 00:47:03,334
So I am backing myself

909
00:47:03,334 --> 00:47:06,999
out of and I will leave it

910
00:47:06,999 --> 00:47:09,125
to come to me to force me

911
00:47:09,125 --> 00:47:11,999
to decide which poison they want.

912
00:47:11,999 --> 00:47:13,834
Either violate certificate

913
00:47:13,834 --> 00:47:15,999
in there or putting a certificate

914
00:47:15,999 --> 00:47:17,999
the whole world knows.

915
00:47:17,999 --> 00:47:20,999
(Applause.) Don't plan for that.

916
00:47:22,667 --> 00:47:25,250
You work

917
00:47:25,250 --> 00:47:27,209
You work

918
00:47:27,209 --> 00:47:30,626
like an IDS and you find

919
00:47:30,626 --> 00:47:34,959
on their citizens, do you do nothing, B,

920
00:47:34,959 --> 00:47:39,083
the company selling it to these folks, C,

921
00:47:39,083 --> 00:47:40,751
dual use.

922
00:47:41,209 --> 00:47:43,876
A, that's a reasonable thing.

923
00:47:43,876 --> 00:47:46,918
Gun manufacture you think

924
00:47:49,792 --> 00:47:51,501
I build a gun.

925
00:47:51,876 --> 00:47:53,417
A gun is not a moral object.

926
00:47:53,417 --> 00:47:54,999
People use it in a good or bad way.

927
00:47:56,167 --> 00:47:58,876
B, change corporate culture.

928
00:47:59,083 --> 00:48:00,375
That won't happen.

929
00:48:00,375 --> 00:48:01,375
Good luck.

930
00:48:01,459 --> 00:48:05,876
C work from a technical perspective.

931
00:48:05,999 --> 00:48:09,667
D, quietly quit and E go nuclear.

932
00:48:10,501 --> 00:48:12,459
This is a tough one.

933
00:48:12,501 --> 00:48:15,167
People that work

934
00:48:15,167 --> 00:48:17,292
day apparently.

935
00:48:18,083 --> 00:48:20,751
So we don't have time

936
00:48:20,751 --> 00:48:23,209
like you guys to do, you don't have

937
00:48:23,209 --> 00:48:26,459
I have no moral authority here

938
00:48:26,459 --> 00:48:28,417
a good thing to do.

939
00:48:28,417 --> 00:48:31,083
Try to live an examined life

940
00:48:31,083 --> 00:48:32,999
Think about what you want to do now.

941
00:48:32,999 --> 00:48:35,083
Don't get caught being asked

942
00:48:35,083 --> 00:48:39,083
and not against your means

943
00:48:39,083 --> 00:48:42,667
It's easy to say yes when you're

944
00:48:42,918 --> 00:48:43,918
Teach people.

945
00:48:43,918 --> 00:48:46,999
People with pony tails have lots

946
00:48:47,083 --> 00:48:50,918
Teach people about how

947
00:48:52,083 --> 00:48:54,542
Be open and honest with themselves.

948
00:48:54,999 --> 00:48:58,999
Something you can do right now

949
00:48:58,999 --> 00:49:04,417
for supporting reform

950
00:49:04,584 --> 00:49:06,751
This letter has been signed

951
00:49:07,876 --> 00:49:09,083
Who else?

952
00:49:09,999 --> 00:49:12,751
I'm blanking, Ari, Schwartz.

953
00:49:12,918 --> 00:49:13,999
Avi Ruben.

954
00:49:16,375 --> 00:49:20,083
Security researchers and academia

955
00:49:20,083 --> 00:49:22,999
private world have signed this.

956
00:49:22,999 --> 00:49:25,292
You don't have to sign it on behalf

957
00:49:25,292 --> 00:49:26,292
This is just you.

958
00:49:26,292 --> 00:49:27,834
If you'd like to get

959
00:49:27,834 --> 00:49:31,709
before it goes public

960
00:49:31,709 --> 00:49:35,876
There's folks up here from the EFF

961
00:49:35,876 --> 00:49:37,999
We're out of time so, if you want

962
00:49:37,999 --> 00:49:40,375
thank you very much for listening.
