DANIEL BURROUGHS: And what I'm talking about today, this is basically,

2
00:00:04,876 --> 00:00:08,375
a follow up to a talk I gave a few years ago at DEF CON 18,

3
00:00:08,375 --> 00:00:11,584
about looking at information that's freely available

4
00:00:11,584 --> 00:00:14,292
out there on the net, and doing some trending

5
00:00:14,292 --> 00:00:19,292
and analysis of it, and trying to make something useful out of it.

6
00:00:19,334 --> 00:00:22,459
So a little bit about my background, I'm currently I'm the director

7
00:00:22,459 --> 00:00:25,584
of technology at the Center for Law Enforcement Technology

8
00:00:25,584 --> 00:00:29,834
training and research, which is a nonprofit research center.

9
00:00:29,834 --> 00:00:32,709
They got spun out of work that I used to do when I was a professor

10
00:00:32,709 --> 00:00:35,918
at the University of Central Florida.

11
00:00:35,959 --> 00:00:38,999
I was there for about ten years and in the engineering program,

12
00:00:38,999 --> 00:00:41,375
taught computer engineering, I developed

13
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:45,626
the computer security curriculum there, and did embedded systems amongst

14
00:00:45,626 --> 00:00:48,083
some other things, and eventually moved away

15
00:00:48,083 --> 00:00:51,292
from teaching and more into research.

16
00:00:51,292 --> 00:00:52,999
And we ended up spinning out the research

17
00:00:52,999 --> 00:00:56,459
into an independent nonprofit center.

18
00:00:56,626 --> 00:00:59,501
I'm also the CTO for Hoverfly Technologies and prior

19
00:00:59,501 --> 00:01:02,584
to this, I used to work as a research associate

20
00:01:02,584 --> 00:01:05,999
up at the institute for security technology studies

21
00:01:05,999 --> 00:01:08,334
the Dartmouth College.

22
00:01:08,709 --> 00:01:13,459
So over the course of the last 20 years, some of the things that I have worked

23
00:01:13,459 --> 00:01:18,334
on appear on this list, and, you know, it took me quite a while to catch

24
00:01:18,334 --> 00:01:21,125
on to kind of what, like, the common theme

25
00:01:21,125 --> 00:01:25,083
between all of the things I was working on.

26
00:01:25,083 --> 00:01:29,459
I'm slow to pick up on these things at times, and eventually,

27
00:01:29,459 --> 00:01:33,876
as I started putting it together and kind.

28
00:01:33,876 --> 00:01:36,999
Realizing some of the same things I was doing,

29
00:01:36,999 --> 00:01:42,459
I realized all of this stuff from information sharing that I'm

30
00:01:42,459 --> 00:01:46,334
working on now, to hardware sensor networks,

31
00:01:46,334 --> 00:01:51,999
to intrusion detections, they rely on sensor fusion.

32
00:01:56,999 --> 00:02:02,083
Everything that we are doing, all of those things that are that I listed

33
00:02:02,083 --> 00:02:06,501
up there, they are all based on taking some sort of sensor,

34
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:10,125
and using it to try to get some measure of reality,

35
00:02:10,125 --> 00:02:14,334
but the sensor always has some limitations.

36
00:02:14,334 --> 00:02:16,083
Sometimes it's a significant one.

37
00:02:16,083 --> 00:02:19,083
Sometimes it's not so bad, but every sensor that we look at reality,

38
00:02:19,083 --> 00:02:22,417
including ourselves, including when we view things,

39
00:02:22,417 --> 00:02:26,999
it's always got some sort of limitation, and it's one particular view,

40
00:02:26,999 --> 00:02:29,709
and that influences the data we are seeing,

41
00:02:29,709 --> 00:02:32,626
and you can get we have to work towards trying

42
00:02:32,626 --> 00:02:37,125
to get more meaningfulness out of the data that we have.

43
00:02:37,125 --> 00:02:39,999
One of the ways that we do this, and one of the things

44
00:02:39,999 --> 00:02:44,375
the techniques that I find most versatile, I would say, is sensor fusion,

45
00:02:44,375 --> 00:02:47,918
where we take multiple sensors, multiple ways of looking

46
00:02:47,918 --> 00:02:50,918
at the same thing, and kind of put that together,

47
00:02:50,918 --> 00:02:54,918
with the hope that we can take the limitations of one observation

48
00:02:54,918 --> 00:02:58,167
and cancel it out with a different observation that has

49
00:02:58,167 --> 00:03:01,083
a different set of limitations.

50
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:02,918
So at least that's the hope.

51
00:03:02,918 --> 00:03:04,417
At least, you know, if we can put two halfway decent things

52
00:03:04,417 --> 00:03:08,083
to go and get something that's more than the sum of its parts.

53
00:03:08,876 --> 00:03:12,250
So before I get kind of more into my stuff, I always feel

54
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:15,999
like with the in this particular subject, that I have to give

55
00:03:15,999 --> 00:03:19,417
an acknowledgment to the guy that inspired kind of some

56
00:03:19,417 --> 00:03:22,334
of these thoughts in my head and it was actually

57
00:03:22,334 --> 00:03:26,250
at DEF CON, way back at DEF CON 13, Broward Horne gave this talk

58
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:29,375
on Meme mining for fun and profit.

59
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:33,834
It's problem you know, all great ideas come out of a problem.

60
00:03:33,999 --> 00:03:37,999
I guess a lot of ideas come out of trying to solve a problem too,

61
00:03:37,999 --> 00:03:41,167
but his was a really good idea.

62
00:03:41,167 --> 00:03:43,876
His problem was that he would find that he would, like,

63
00:03:43,876 --> 00:03:47,999
start learning some new technology, some new tool or at least it was new

64
00:03:47,999 --> 00:03:51,459
to him and by the time he felt he had mastered it, it was kind

65
00:03:51,459 --> 00:03:55,167
of on the way out or the market, the job market was just saturated

66
00:03:55,167 --> 00:03:58,918
with people doing that now or it had just fallen by the wayside

67
00:03:58,918 --> 00:04:01,292
and nobody cared about it.

68
00:04:01,292 --> 00:04:06,999
He was always kind of struggling, what should I spend my time learning

69
00:04:06,999 --> 00:04:09,125
to get ahead?

70
00:04:09,125 --> 00:04:11,501
And he ended up kind of thinking about this as like,

71
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:14,209
everything has this sort of saturation curve where

72
00:04:14,209 --> 00:04:17,626
a trend starts happening and there's a little bit of chatter

73
00:04:17,626 --> 00:04:21,125
about it and eventually it starts taking off, and everybody hears

74
00:04:21,125 --> 00:04:25,999
about it when it's big and growing and then it gets boring and old.

75
00:04:25,999 --> 00:04:30,501
You want to try those things earlier on and went through and did it.

76
00:04:30,501 --> 00:04:33,999
This is a slide pulled out of his old presentation.

77
00:04:35,542 --> 00:04:40,999
What he would do is he would look at new sources and forums and blogs,

78
00:04:40,999 --> 00:04:44,999
for information and key words and kind of pull them

79
00:04:44,999 --> 00:04:50,542
out and see what was trending on there, with the idea that that's kind

80
00:04:50,542 --> 00:04:54,751
of a precursor to seeing that early chatter about it,

81
00:04:54,751 --> 00:04:57,792
so something can take off.

82
00:04:57,792 --> 00:05:01,999
This one in this particular case, this is the red line shows how many times

83
00:05:01,999 --> 00:05:06,999
the word "palladium" showed up in news reports and forums.

84
00:05:06,999 --> 00:05:09,626
And the blue is the "price of palladium" and you can see clearly

85
00:05:09,626 --> 00:05:13,167
there's a lot of chatter about it before the price spiked up and then

86
00:05:13,167 --> 00:05:17,125
the chatter dropped off before the price came back down.

87
00:05:17,125 --> 00:05:21,584
It's a really good indicator about predicting the future there,

88
00:05:21,584 --> 00:05:23,959
what's going on.

89
00:05:24,125 --> 00:05:28,125
Anyway, that thought inspired me and when I was when I was teaching,

90
00:05:28,125 --> 00:05:32,417
I would have students who could come to me and they would want to know,

91
00:05:32,417 --> 00:05:36,584
what skills do they need to get a good job and all of that and I tried

92
00:05:36,584 --> 00:05:40,125
to apply what Broward had done in a similar way by monitoring

93
00:05:40,125 --> 00:05:44,876
and observing trends and this is single variable observation.

94
00:05:44,918 --> 00:05:47,125
It's doing some correlation and it started off looking

95
00:05:47,125 --> 00:05:51,667
at Craigslist data, just because Craigslist is nicely available.

96
00:05:51,667 --> 00:05:53,999
It's well organized by geographic location and you can go

97
00:05:53,999 --> 00:05:57,834
in in certain categories, like where they have the job postings in there,

98
00:05:57,834 --> 00:06:00,999
it's categories by different types of jobs.

99
00:06:00,999 --> 00:06:03,542
Craigslist is not the best place to look for jobs

100
00:06:03,542 --> 00:06:06,792
but it had some interesting properties in that there are a lot

101
00:06:06,792 --> 00:06:10,083
of small companies that post on there or maybe trying new things,

102
00:06:10,083 --> 00:06:12,834
a lot of entrepreneurial companies, start ups things

103
00:06:12,834 --> 00:06:16,626
like that are starting there, not so much the big ones.

104
00:06:16,999 --> 00:06:20,375
That tends to skew it a little bit more towards being

105
00:06:20,375 --> 00:06:25,459
a leading indicator, something that is it will come out a bit ahead

106
00:06:25,459 --> 00:06:27,417
of the curve.

107
00:06:27,417 --> 00:06:29,083
So some of the things that I ended up looking at, just

108
00:06:29,083 --> 00:06:31,999
because I found correlations in here were jobs, items for sale

109
00:06:31,999 --> 00:06:33,918
and adult services.

110
00:06:33,918 --> 00:06:38,375
And I didn't I'm not saying I looked for adult services on Craigslist.

111
00:06:38,375 --> 00:06:40,125
It's just my research took me there.

112
00:06:41,083 --> 00:06:42,626
(Laughter).

113
00:06:42,999 --> 00:06:47,125
So, you know, the things I saw, looked like this.

114
00:06:47,167 --> 00:06:48,375
This is an example.

115
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:50,584
This is just showing job postings by date.

116
00:06:50,626 --> 00:06:53,876
And there is a this is showing the dips you see there,

117
00:06:53,876 --> 00:06:58,542
these are weekly trends, it goes dead on the weekends.

118
00:06:58,542 --> 00:07:00,999
There's a spike on a Monday and a spike on a Friday.

119
00:07:01,626 --> 00:07:04,209
Okay, it's kind of boring.

120
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:06,751
It's sort of interesting, but not unexpected.

121
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:08,959
There were certain things that stood out.

122
00:07:08,999 --> 00:07:11,334
In this particular case, one of the things that jumped

123
00:07:11,334 --> 00:07:14,999
out at me was Austin never had a spike on a Friday.

124
00:07:14,999 --> 00:07:16,125
It always dropped off.

125
00:07:16,125 --> 00:07:19,083
It's kind of hard to see, but it's the orange line in there.

126
00:07:19,083 --> 00:07:20,834
It never has a second spike in it.

127
00:07:20,834 --> 00:07:22,375
I thought that was interesting.

128
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:23,083
The other thing, and this is what came

129
00:07:23,083 --> 00:07:26,167
out of the adult services was there was a correlation

130
00:07:26,167 --> 00:07:29,999
between adult services being offered or bicycles for sale or a lot

131
00:07:29,999 --> 00:07:32,083
of items for sale.

132
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:35,626
This led to a couple of interesting discussions.

133
00:07:35,834 --> 00:07:38,292
One of my favorite moments at DEF CON, when someone said, hey,

134
00:07:38,292 --> 00:07:41,083
I think I can help you out, I'm from Austin and my sister

135
00:07:41,083 --> 00:07:42,999
is a prostitute.

136
00:07:45,083 --> 00:07:46,334
(Laughter).

137
00:07:47,292 --> 00:07:49,167
So that and then it led into a discussion

138
00:07:49,167 --> 00:07:52,751
of things could you sell one time, like a bicycle or something that you can

139
00:07:52,751 --> 00:07:55,209
sell over and over and over again.

140
00:07:58,083 --> 00:08:01,999
So, okay, that's what I had done before, and we had looked at that.

141
00:08:01,999 --> 00:08:04,501
There's some interesting stuff there, but I wanted to dig a bit deeper

142
00:08:04,501 --> 00:08:06,709
into the data and look for more relationships

143
00:08:06,709 --> 00:08:09,334
and more correlations between data and hopefully be able

144
00:08:09,334 --> 00:08:12,999
to pull in other sources and do some fusions on this.

145
00:08:12,999 --> 00:08:15,167
I started looking for things like different cycles

146
00:08:15,167 --> 00:08:19,417
in like the job postings or correlations in them.

147
00:08:19,417 --> 00:08:21,375
Because at the time when I was working on them, keep in mind,

148
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:24,459
I was really trying to help out some of the students and figure

149
00:08:24,459 --> 00:08:27,292
out what skills they needed and what would really help them

150
00:08:27,292 --> 00:08:28,918
get ahead.

151
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:32,876
There were definitely correlations in there.

152
00:08:32,999 --> 00:08:34,459
You know, there are things that you would see,

153
00:08:34,459 --> 00:08:36,417
but nothing unexpected.

154
00:08:36,417 --> 00:08:39,959
Nothing really interesting that jumped out in related skills.

155
00:08:39,959 --> 00:08:44,250
Could you say if a job was going to have one particular tool set

156
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:47,999
or skill set listed, there are other ones likely

157
00:08:47,999 --> 00:08:51,209
to be listed with it as well.

158
00:08:51,999 --> 00:08:54,999
Again, nothing really jumped out at me as being unexpected out of it,

159
00:08:54,999 --> 00:08:59,209
but eventually, there were a couple of interesting things that showed up.

160
00:08:59,584 --> 00:09:02,584
One was kind of funny and it was how often

161
00:09:02,584 --> 00:09:05,459
the words drug test or drug screen showed

162
00:09:05,459 --> 00:09:11,375
up in a job advertisement correlated with the different skills in it.

163
00:09:11,375 --> 00:09:13,999
And apparently, like (Laughter) If you don't think you are

164
00:09:13,999 --> 00:09:16,999
going to pass a drug test, don't bother learning SAP,

165
00:09:16,999 --> 00:09:19,999
because it won't do you any good.

166
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:26,999
If you want to develop IOS applications, you know, go knock yourself out.

167
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:28,792
(Laughter).

168
00:09:28,876 --> 00:09:30,959
You know, I guess there's probably some logic

169
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:35,918
here, like how corporate or uncorporate the environment is, I suppose.

170
00:09:36,667 --> 00:09:40,334
Another thing was looking at jobs that had benefits, and

171
00:09:40,334 --> 00:09:43,999
like retirement and health and medical.

172
00:09:44,334 --> 00:09:46,876
You know, the interesting one, the best one was COBOL

173
00:09:46,876 --> 00:09:51,167
but I think it was a bit of an outlier, there were so few jobs with COBOL.

174
00:09:51,167 --> 00:09:52,999
I guess to get any grizzled COBOL programmer

175
00:09:52,999 --> 00:09:57,459
to come work for you, you had to give them a lot of benefits.

176
00:09:59,083 --> 00:10:03,999
Python and Android, and HTML, you won't give them much in the way

177
00:10:03,999 --> 00:10:06,751
of benefits, I suppose.

178
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:15,125
As I was looking into this actually, this is much more recently.

179
00:10:15,125 --> 00:10:16,501
This is earlier this year.

180
00:10:16,501 --> 00:10:17,999
I came across this article.

181
00:10:17,999 --> 00:10:21,000
This is actually out of the journal of "Psychology" where a psychologist,

182
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,999
Dorothy Brambel.

183
00:10:24,542 --> 00:10:30,250
She looked at the missed connections of Craigslist.

184
00:10:30,751 --> 00:10:34,626
This is where people say, oh, I saw you as I was walking

185
00:10:34,626 --> 00:10:39,209
across the parking lot and tried to catch your eye and they post it

186
00:10:39,209 --> 00:10:42,918
and hope they will make a connection.

187
00:10:43,167 --> 00:10:45,542
This is organized by state.

188
00:10:45,542 --> 00:10:49,375
This is where people had the most missed connections.

189
00:10:51,375 --> 00:10:54,209
Walmart has a log on the South.

190
00:10:54,209 --> 00:10:55,209
(Laughter).

191
00:10:56,417 --> 00:10:59,959
You know, Oklahoma, it's the state fair.

192
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:00,959
Of course!

193
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:02,584
You know, it makes perfect sense.

194
00:11:02,584 --> 00:11:04,792
And, you know, in Nevada, it's casinos.

195
00:11:04,999 --> 00:11:07,751
And the one thing I just had to put this up there,

196
00:11:07,751 --> 00:11:11,667
one thing that just jumped out at me like crazy was Indiana,

197
00:11:11,667 --> 00:11:13,459
it's at home.

198
00:11:13,459 --> 00:11:14,459
(Laughter).

199
00:11:14,459 --> 00:11:18,292
I don't know what they're doing in Indiana, but I'm pretty sure

200
00:11:18,292 --> 00:11:21,334
they are doing it wrong.

201
00:11:23,626 --> 00:11:24,999
(Laughter).

202
00:11:25,501 --> 00:11:29,250
So I was talking with a friend of mine about this stuff,

203
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:33,542
Dave Kerbletski and he told me about something that he had done

204
00:11:33,542 --> 00:11:37,167
in his neighborhood in Orlando, Florida.

205
00:11:37,626 --> 00:11:40,999
They had a rash of crime, recently and they didn't know they had a rash

206
00:11:40,999 --> 00:11:45,125
of crime, until the neighbors got talking to even other.

207
00:11:45,501 --> 00:11:47,334
Everybody knew a little different incident that

208
00:11:47,334 --> 00:11:48,999
had happened.

209
00:11:48,999 --> 00:11:50,999
He went and did some searching and found

210
00:11:50,999 --> 00:11:55,751
out that there was some open source data that the sheriff's department would

211
00:11:55,751 --> 00:11:58,542
post about their CAD, their dispatch calls and

212
00:11:58,542 --> 00:12:01,459
he wrote this little tool to do some geolocating

213
00:12:01,459 --> 00:12:04,999
on it and tweet it out and then you can subscribe to it,

214
00:12:04,999 --> 00:12:08,834
and get tweets from this thing, like, really hyper local things

215
00:12:08,834 --> 00:12:12,999
for your neighborhood, about what's going on there.

216
00:12:13,125 --> 00:12:15,626
And it's actually one thing that's fun.

217
00:12:15,834 --> 00:12:20,417
I pulled this up earlier today, and, like, you know, I was just noticing things.

218
00:12:20,459 --> 00:12:22,334
This is in Orlando area.

219
00:12:22,334 --> 00:12:23,999
You know, the first tweet that's on there, and I'm amazed

220
00:12:23,999 --> 00:12:26,709
at the you know, the sheriff's office is putting this out,

221
00:12:26,709 --> 00:12:29,876
they are basically saying there's a designated patrol area available,

222
00:12:29,876 --> 00:12:31,584
which means there's an area that nobody

223
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:33,876
is patrolling it currently.

224
00:12:33,999 --> 00:12:38,626
And this is down, like, in a real tourist trap part of Orlando.

225
00:12:38,999 --> 00:12:40,626
That could be useful information to somebody,

226
00:12:40,626 --> 00:12:43,501
to know there are no cops there right now.

227
00:12:43,501 --> 00:12:45,709
And then there's a few accidents and then I guess the people

228
00:12:45,709 --> 00:12:47,918
at the bottom, down on Poppy Avenue would be

229
00:12:47,918 --> 00:12:50,751
happy to note that there's a fugitive from justice running

230
00:12:50,751 --> 00:12:52,792
around in their area.

231
00:12:54,334 --> 00:12:58,417
This kind of led us to look into more sources for data.

232
00:12:58,417 --> 00:13:01,959
What they offered where we were, wasn't very wasn't very useful

233
00:13:01,959 --> 00:13:03,751
or organized.

234
00:13:03,751 --> 00:13:06,751
We found out and started looking in places that kind of subscribe

235
00:13:06,751 --> 00:13:09,209
to the open gov system and this is a movement

236
00:13:09,209 --> 00:13:12,667
to have more transparent government data.

237
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:15,751
Some cities publish huge amounts of data about what's going

238
00:13:15,751 --> 00:13:19,209
on in their city, the fire department, the police department,

239
00:13:19,209 --> 00:13:24,459
live interesting data, and Seattle, Boston, Chicago, a number of others.

240
00:13:24,459 --> 00:13:27,083
These are three that I spent a bit of time looking at.

241
00:13:27,083 --> 00:13:29,501
There's information about incidents that are going on, like,

242
00:13:29,501 --> 00:13:31,083
police, fire.

243
00:13:31,083 --> 00:13:32,751
In Chicago, you can actually track where

244
00:13:32,751 --> 00:13:35,250
the snowplows are in the city.

245
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:38,292
You can track where garbage trucks are in realtime, from the city,

246
00:13:38,292 --> 00:13:41,999
which I just find really kind of fascinating.

247
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:44,709
There's information about where bicycle racks,

248
00:13:44,709 --> 00:13:47,751
public toilets, land marks and even where cameras are, where

249
00:13:47,751 --> 00:13:51,667
the city has all of its cameras posted, which that one I thought was actually

250
00:13:51,667 --> 00:13:53,999
particularly interesting but you can really go

251
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:56,876
on here and make a map of what is an observable location

252
00:13:56,876 --> 00:14:00,959
throughout the city, and what is not an observable location.

253
00:14:01,083 --> 00:14:02,584
Which, again, that could be useful information

254
00:14:02,584 --> 00:14:04,083
for somebody.

255
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:07,083
Here's something, the Seattle one is great.

256
00:14:07,083 --> 00:14:10,542
They have their visualization tools built right into this thing and this

257
00:14:10,542 --> 00:14:12,999
is showing a map showing police incidents

258
00:14:12,999 --> 00:14:18,667
over a period of time, around in part of Seattle and I pulled up this area.

259
00:14:18,667 --> 00:14:22,918
You notice, like most of it everything is kind of in that same yellow orange,

260
00:14:22,918 --> 00:14:26,876
except for one big glowing red blob out there and, you know,

261
00:14:26,876 --> 00:14:28,999
over in Georgetown.

262
00:14:28,999 --> 00:14:31,334
I don't know if anybody is from Seattle here.

263
00:14:31,334 --> 00:14:34,834
But I'm like wondering what the heck is going on over in Georgetown.

264
00:14:34,834 --> 00:14:37,501
And you look in a little bit closer and right next to it

265
00:14:37,501 --> 00:14:44,083
is the Boeing Propulsion Engineering Labs, which makes me feel really good.

266
00:14:44,667 --> 00:14:49,584
So coming back, to an area I know a bit more about, back in Orlando,

267
00:14:49,584 --> 00:14:52,417
we pulled up data that had we pulled

268
00:14:52,417 --> 00:14:55,999
out traffic ticket, they don't publish data

269
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:59,209
about who got ticket, but you can see when

270
00:14:59,209 --> 00:15:02,083
a traffic stop occurred.

271
00:15:02,125 --> 00:15:07,125
And I we looked at it and pulled data, that covered three roads in the area

272
00:15:07,125 --> 00:15:12,542
and this is right out by the University of Central Florida.

273
00:15:12,542 --> 00:15:14,751
These are three roads that run all east west and they are

274
00:15:14,751 --> 00:15:18,417
the three major roads just kind of one is right into the university, and one

275
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:21,083
is a bit north and one is a bit south and they all have

276
00:15:21,083 --> 00:15:23,876
about the same amount of traffic on and they all have

277
00:15:23,876 --> 00:15:25,999
a similar traffic pattern.

278
00:15:26,083 --> 00:15:30,417
And when we went through and what this chart

279
00:15:30,417 --> 00:15:35,542
is showing here is this is each one of the groupings

280
00:15:35,542 --> 00:15:40,834
is a is a week long period, five week days.

281
00:15:40,834 --> 00:15:42,709
And then it's repeated over six weeks.

282
00:15:42,999 --> 00:15:48,083
And one of the things I found really interesting was the chance

283
00:15:48,083 --> 00:15:52,834
of a traffic ticket occurring on one of these roads,

284
00:15:52,834 --> 00:15:59,167
the order it was always likely at different times of the day.

285
00:15:59,167 --> 00:16:02,083
It always followed the same sort of pattern, particularly

286
00:16:02,083 --> 00:16:06,083
between this highway 50 and University Boulevard.

287
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:09,751
The Highway 50 traffic stops all preceded

288
00:16:09,751 --> 00:16:13,542
the University Boulevard traffic stops and when you go out there

289
00:16:13,542 --> 00:16:16,417
and you look at the traffic, the traffic pattern

290
00:16:16,417 --> 00:16:19,083
is not really any different.

291
00:16:19,083 --> 00:16:22,250
So if you start thinking about this and start putting together, well,

292
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:24,501
why you know, why do you always see one

293
00:16:24,501 --> 00:16:27,792
before the other, I don't have you know I don't have hard

294
00:16:27,792 --> 00:16:30,999
evidence to back this up, but our belief is you are seeing

295
00:16:30,999 --> 00:16:35,417
an influence of the patrol pattern of the police in the city.

296
00:16:35,417 --> 00:16:37,667
So you are actually able to kind of get in there and

297
00:16:37,667 --> 00:16:40,584
through their information that they are putting out sort

298
00:16:40,584 --> 00:16:42,834
of start tracking them.

299
00:16:42,834 --> 00:16:45,834
It's kind of like, you know, there's a talk we went to earlier yesterday,

300
00:16:45,834 --> 00:16:49,999
I guess it was, there's a great talk with Brendan O'Connor that was talking

301
00:16:49,999 --> 00:16:54,083
about tracking people by seeing, like, information their devices are spitting

302
00:16:54,083 --> 00:16:56,542
out on wireless networks.

303
00:16:57,626 --> 00:17:00,999
It's a similar concept, that they are putting out a lot

304
00:17:00,999 --> 00:17:04,999
of information here, that is that if you look at it the right way

305
00:17:04,999 --> 00:17:09,250
and you take the right pieces of data, and put it to go, you can pull

306
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:11,999
a lot more information out about what their

307
00:17:11,999 --> 00:17:15,834
about what they're doing and what's going on.

308
00:17:17,417 --> 00:17:21,083
So, you know, why so by this time, I have kind of changed kind

309
00:17:21,083 --> 00:17:23,876
of what I was interested in doing and probably

310
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:27,667
because I quit teaching and I left the university so I don't have

311
00:17:27,667 --> 00:17:29,667
students anymore.

312
00:17:29,667 --> 00:17:32,292
I'm not that interested in helping people find jobs.

313
00:17:32,292 --> 00:17:36,375
So now I found it kind of interesting to look at these government entities

314
00:17:36,375 --> 00:17:40,501
and the police and other things that were going on and also

315
00:17:40,501 --> 00:17:44,999
because I have worked with law enforcement a lot.

316
00:17:44,999 --> 00:17:48,375
It's kind of interesting to see how on one hand, they are very protective

317
00:17:48,375 --> 00:17:51,999
of their data, but at the same time, they are putting out a lot

318
00:17:51,999 --> 00:17:55,999
of information that I'm not sure that they quite realize how much that

319
00:17:55,999 --> 00:17:58,584
they are putting out there.

320
00:17:58,584 --> 00:18:01,292
Frankly, I think it's actually kind of a good thing.

321
00:18:01,292 --> 00:18:02,792
I like being able to have more information

322
00:18:02,792 --> 00:18:05,834
and being able to look back on them and like I say, why should

323
00:18:05,834 --> 00:18:08,999
the NSA have all the fun on spying on people?

324
00:18:10,167 --> 00:18:15,083
So the what's next with this, and there's there so much more I would

325
00:18:15,083 --> 00:18:18,999
like to talk about, but these 20 minute talks you have

326
00:18:18,999 --> 00:18:21,542
to be kind of fast in.

327
00:18:22,626 --> 00:18:26,918
What I'm really interested in is actually expanding

328
00:18:26,918 --> 00:18:32,999
the model that we have been using on this data to be analyzed.

329
00:18:32,999 --> 00:18:37,334
We kind of built things that are very purpose driven, that the first net

330
00:18:37,334 --> 00:18:40,209
of analysis, we did was very structured

331
00:18:40,209 --> 00:18:44,584
around the seeking out the jobs, doing that, and then kind

332
00:18:44,584 --> 00:18:50,083
of got side tracked by the crime and going off that direction.

333
00:18:50,083 --> 00:18:52,584
And I want to bring this back together and try

334
00:18:52,584 --> 00:18:56,999
to build a more robust model for analyzing this data and throw some

335
00:18:56,999 --> 00:19:01,999
data mining at this, where so far a lot of what we have done has been what

336
00:19:01,999 --> 00:19:05,209
I would say is like hypothesis based where I make

337
00:19:05,209 --> 00:19:07,999
a prediction about something I should see

338
00:19:07,999 --> 00:19:12,584
in here and then a correlation and see whether it exists in the data

339
00:19:12,584 --> 00:19:14,751
or doesn't exist.

340
00:19:14,751 --> 00:19:19,999
And I'm sure there's a lot of relations in there that are things that I wouldn't

341
00:19:19,999 --> 00:19:24,959
expect or I wouldn't find otherwise, I want to throw a bit of sort

342
00:19:24,959 --> 00:19:30,542
of data mining and kind of that sort of blind either either AI or brute force

343
00:19:30,542 --> 00:19:35,167
approach to finding relations throughout the data.

344
00:19:35,459 --> 00:19:37,542
So I think I'm about out of time right now

345
00:19:37,542 --> 00:19:40,999
and I'm getting a nod from the back and so I will wrap it up there and

346
00:19:40,999 --> 00:19:43,834
if there are any questions, I would happy to take a couple

347
00:19:43,834 --> 00:19:45,959
until they cut me off.

348
00:19:46,667 --> 00:19:47,999
(Applause).

349
00:19:48,834 --> 00:19:49,999
Thank you.

350
00:19:53,083 --> 00:19:54,459
Okay.

351
00:19:57,584 --> 00:19:58,999
Thank you.
