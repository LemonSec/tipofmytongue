1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,083
LT.

2
00:00:01,083 --> 00:00:02,083
GEN.

3
00:00:02,083 --> 00:00:03,375
ROBERT ELDER: All right.

4
00:00:03,375 --> 00:00:05,209
It is great to be with all of you today.

5
00:00:05,209 --> 00:00:07,459
I saw a few of you last night had one of those shots and one of those

6
00:00:07,459 --> 00:00:11,209
at least one of those shots in one of those rooms.

7
00:00:11,209 --> 00:00:12,999
I really am pleased to be here.

8
00:00:12,999 --> 00:00:14,751
I'm grad to see a good crowd.

9
00:00:14,918 --> 00:00:18,375
It is not my first DEF CON but it is my first time speaking.

10
00:00:20,709 --> 00:00:24,751
Nikko said the topic the way it was listed wasn't didn't have

11
00:00:24,751 --> 00:00:27,125
enough pizzazz so she put from nuclear

12
00:00:27,125 --> 00:00:30,250
to cyber alternative approaches.

13
00:00:30,501 --> 00:00:32,250
I want to make sure I get the nuclear part

14
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:36,459
in so you didn't waste your time or waste your ticket here.

15
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,083
So when I was in the military my primary business was

16
00:00:41,083 --> 00:00:43,542
doing nuclear ops.

17
00:00:43,626 --> 00:00:46,125
But interestingly enough, when the Air Force stood

18
00:00:46,125 --> 00:00:49,209
up the cyber mission, they gave that mission to my command,

19
00:00:49,209 --> 00:00:51,584
not because they thought it was like nuclear

20
00:00:51,584 --> 00:00:54,667
but because nuclear was a global mission and they saw cyber

21
00:00:54,667 --> 00:00:56,709
as a global mission.

22
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,083
But what I want to talk to you about today is that we somehow

23
00:01:01,083 --> 00:01:04,542
or quite often are constrained the way we think

24
00:01:04,542 --> 00:01:08,999
about cyberspace except in places like DEF CON.

25
00:01:09,334 --> 00:01:11,584
What I want to do is I'm actually looking

26
00:01:11,584 --> 00:01:14,125
to get some ideas from you quite frankly

27
00:01:14,125 --> 00:01:19,209
because the people in this room tend to think outside the box.

28
00:01:19,375 --> 00:01:22,083
But a lot of this is about looking at things a different way,

29
00:01:22,083 --> 00:01:25,999
challenging assumptions and looking at the way we think about the world

30
00:01:25,999 --> 00:01:29,292
and so the nuclear part of this is if you think about what we did

31
00:01:29,292 --> 00:01:33,375
with nuclear weapons at the beginning, I wasn't born then.

32
00:01:33,834 --> 00:01:37,751
But those weapons were being used for war fighting.

33
00:01:37,751 --> 00:01:39,542
And so when we dropped them in Japan,

34
00:01:39,542 --> 00:01:43,334
they were considered war fighting weapons.

35
00:01:43,334 --> 00:01:45,334
Very quickly they said this is not a good war fighting weapon

36
00:01:45,334 --> 00:01:48,999
and it became what they call now a political weapon.

37
00:01:48,999 --> 00:01:51,083
It was used in a completely different way.

38
00:01:51,083 --> 00:01:55,083
And then during the Cold War it evolved to something that actually caused

39
00:01:55,083 --> 00:01:58,083
the then Soviet Union and the West to not fight

40
00:01:58,083 --> 00:02:01,501
because they got so worried if they got into a fight,

41
00:02:01,501 --> 00:02:03,999
a war would break out.

42
00:02:04,167 --> 00:02:05,709
What's interesting is the weapons took

43
00:02:05,709 --> 00:02:10,375
on a completely different context than they were originally created to do.

44
00:02:10,834 --> 00:02:13,751
I think there is some parallels to that in cyberspace and that's what I want

45
00:02:13,751 --> 00:02:15,834
to talk to you about today.

46
00:02:16,834 --> 00:02:20,709
First I want to talk a little bit about some different perspectives

47
00:02:20,709 --> 00:02:25,501
on cyberspace, different ways to look at it, I guess I should say.

48
00:02:25,501 --> 00:02:28,334
I want to remind you how we tend to look at it typically

49
00:02:28,334 --> 00:02:32,876
from a network protection standpoint, and then I want to try to argue

50
00:02:32,876 --> 00:02:36,542
for possibly a different model to look at it that would be

51
00:02:36,542 --> 00:02:40,584
a proactive view that looks at both defense and then assurance,

52
00:02:40,584 --> 00:02:42,999
the ability to use it.

53
00:02:42,999 --> 00:02:46,334
There is another model that DHS has put out that

54
00:02:46,334 --> 00:02:49,999
they call their cyber ecosystem.

55
00:02:49,999 --> 00:02:52,999
And I just want to show you that if you haven't seen it before.

56
00:02:52,999 --> 00:02:55,125
Actually looking for some feedback for it.

57
00:02:55,125 --> 00:02:58,292
And then tell you some things about trying to get that to work.

58
00:02:58,292 --> 00:03:00,959
And then I want to talk a little bit about cyber workforce development

59
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:03,709
and extend that to cyber leadership.

60
00:03:05,999 --> 00:03:09,083
One of the big problems we would have in the Air Force is that some

61
00:03:09,083 --> 00:03:11,999
of our very best pilots, they loved flying so much that

62
00:03:11,999 --> 00:03:14,999
they never wanted to leave the airplane and they got very good

63
00:03:14,999 --> 00:03:18,250
at it but they could never get promoted and get into some jobs where

64
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:21,999
they could really influence some of the things going on.

65
00:03:21,999 --> 00:03:23,209
They would end up complaining about it but they weren't able

66
00:03:23,209 --> 00:03:24,709
to move up.

67
00:03:24,834 --> 00:03:27,375
Some of this in terms of leader development

68
00:03:27,375 --> 00:03:30,876
is I think we need to do more of that in the cyber world

69
00:03:30,876 --> 00:03:34,250
because for the most part people making decisions related

70
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:37,999
to cyberspace didn't grow up from the beginnings that you are

71
00:03:37,999 --> 00:03:40,083
all familiar with.

72
00:03:41,167 --> 00:03:44,999
So the first thing and this is an old slide I used back

73
00:03:44,999 --> 00:03:46,999
in the Air Force.

74
00:03:46,999 --> 00:03:48,999
It has to do with getting people in the Air Force

75
00:03:48,999 --> 00:03:53,083
to think differently about how they approach cyberspace.

76
00:03:53,083 --> 00:03:54,584
What I found is there were three different ways

77
00:03:54,584 --> 00:03:58,209
people in the Air Force thought about the cyberspace.

78
00:03:58,209 --> 00:04:02,375
The first one was communications group.

79
00:04:02,792 --> 00:04:04,999
Cyberspace is a different way we were able

80
00:04:04,999 --> 00:04:08,918
to communicate, and so cyberspace is what we do because we set

81
00:04:08,918 --> 00:04:11,083
up all the networks.

82
00:04:11,083 --> 00:04:12,918
We set up the communication lines.

83
00:04:13,292 --> 00:04:15,834
We managed those networks.

84
00:04:15,834 --> 00:04:17,918
When they break down, we take care of it.

85
00:04:19,292 --> 00:04:22,083
That view is actually a proper view.

86
00:04:22,501 --> 00:04:25,250
And then you had the intelligence community that said,

87
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:27,999
well, you know, the only way to really defend

88
00:04:27,999 --> 00:04:31,417
against attacks we are getting in cyberspace is we have

89
00:04:31,417 --> 00:04:34,834
to have this really good intelligence.

90
00:04:34,834 --> 00:04:37,083
And so the only way to, therefore, be able to defend the networks

91
00:04:37,083 --> 00:04:40,417
is you have to be really good intelligence people.

92
00:04:40,417 --> 00:04:42,667
So they argued that cyberspace should be controlled

93
00:04:42,667 --> 00:04:46,459
by the intelligence community because they're the only one that

94
00:04:46,459 --> 00:04:51,999
is would really fully understand how the intelligence and what that meant.

95
00:04:51,999 --> 00:04:53,792
And then but the Air Force took

96
00:04:53,792 --> 00:04:57,167
a different view of this, at least initially.

97
00:04:57,334 --> 00:04:59,999
And they said, you know, everybody uses cyberspace and

98
00:04:59,999 --> 00:05:03,584
as it grows, we are using it more and more.

99
00:05:03,584 --> 00:05:06,083
We use it for all of our different operations.

100
00:05:06,083 --> 00:05:08,999
And at first the things we did with cyberspace, we used it

101
00:05:08,999 --> 00:05:12,834
to extend the things we are already doing.

102
00:05:12,999 --> 00:05:16,709
If I could use a commercial example, these days nobody use Yellow

103
00:05:16,709 --> 00:05:18,584
Pages anymore.

104
00:05:18,999 --> 00:05:21,375
You go on your computer and look something up and get a lot

105
00:05:21,375 --> 00:05:25,125
of information, you can Yelp it or something else and get a review.

106
00:05:26,375 --> 00:05:28,999
That's a legacy capability to say I can use cyberspace

107
00:05:28,999 --> 00:05:31,083
to do that a little better.

108
00:05:31,083 --> 00:05:35,083
Then you have people that really took cyberspace and did things really

109
00:05:35,083 --> 00:05:37,999
differently like Google or Amazon where they say

110
00:05:37,999 --> 00:05:42,083
because of cyberspace I do things completely differently.

111
00:05:42,501 --> 00:05:45,999
Up until now, for the most part, almost everything we do

112
00:05:45,999 --> 00:05:48,292
is through cyberspace.

113
00:05:48,584 --> 00:05:51,626
We do very little actually in cyberspace

114
00:05:51,626 --> 00:05:55,501
to where we're operating inside the space and there

115
00:05:55,501 --> 00:05:59,999
is some type of transactions occurring inside.

116
00:06:00,459 --> 00:06:03,083
People say cyberspace is really a different domain

117
00:06:03,083 --> 00:06:07,999
because it's manmade and you can't operate you can't live there yourself.

118
00:06:07,999 --> 00:06:10,709
If you go into space, you have to have a space capsule.

119
00:06:10,709 --> 00:06:12,667
You can't really go into cyberspace.

120
00:06:12,667 --> 00:06:15,834
So they had some hard times getting their arms around this.

121
00:06:15,834 --> 00:06:17,999
The point of this is what the Air Force did

122
00:06:17,999 --> 00:06:21,751
is says we are going to put cyberspace under the control

123
00:06:21,751 --> 00:06:23,918
of the operators.

124
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:26,918
What we did is we said, Intel people keep doing what you

125
00:06:26,918 --> 00:06:28,375
were doing.

126
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:29,834
We want you to find out where the attacks are coming

127
00:06:29,834 --> 00:06:31,626
and help us defend.

128
00:06:31,751 --> 00:06:33,792
And com community, we want you to keep building

129
00:06:33,792 --> 00:06:38,083
up these physical networks and do the things so we can operate.

130
00:06:38,459 --> 00:06:41,167
Just some different ways to look at this.

131
00:06:41,542 --> 00:06:46,709
When we tried to figure out how to leverage cyberspace, I tell people

132
00:06:46,709 --> 00:06:53,083
the reason that we have airlines is not so that you can have a TSA.

133
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:58,125
You have a TSA to do security so the airlines can operate safely.

134
00:06:58,125 --> 00:06:59,709
It is the same thing.

135
00:06:59,999 --> 00:07:02,334
With cybersecurity, cyberspace does not exist

136
00:07:02,334 --> 00:07:04,584
to have cybersecurity.

137
00:07:04,876 --> 00:07:06,999
Cybersecurity is necessary so you can operate

138
00:07:06,999 --> 00:07:09,125
properly in cyberspace.

139
00:07:09,584 --> 00:07:12,250
Cyberspace is important because of all the things you can do

140
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:13,709
with it.

141
00:07:13,709 --> 00:07:16,167
And so one of the things that it does, it gives you this capability

142
00:07:16,167 --> 00:07:19,584
to bring together all these different communities.

143
00:07:19,999 --> 00:07:23,751
And as you see listed up here, it can be whether it is a political,

144
00:07:23,751 --> 00:07:27,209
it can be a military, it can be economic.

145
00:07:27,209 --> 00:07:29,250
It allows you to do a lot of social things.

146
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:30,999
That's one of the areas we see growing

147
00:07:30,999 --> 00:07:33,083
up substantially.

148
00:07:33,083 --> 00:07:35,626
Of course, it allows us to have these information flows

149
00:07:35,626 --> 00:07:37,751
all over the world.

150
00:07:37,876 --> 00:07:42,459
So, it allows us to it is all about networking, right?

151
00:07:42,667 --> 00:07:44,167
You have physical networks.

152
00:07:44,167 --> 00:07:46,250
You have these informational networks.

153
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:49,667
And then ultimately you have people networks that are using this.

154
00:07:49,667 --> 00:07:50,250
And that whole thing put together is what makes

155
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:52,834
the cyberspace so tremendous.

156
00:07:52,999 --> 00:07:55,459
But it has these interesting attributes.

157
00:07:55,459 --> 00:07:57,626
One of the attributes is that for the most part,

158
00:07:57,626 --> 00:08:01,584
when people are operating there, it's you're anonymous when you are

159
00:08:01,584 --> 00:08:03,334
operating it.

160
00:08:03,334 --> 00:08:04,334
You don't have to be.

161
00:08:04,334 --> 00:08:04,999
If you want people to know who you are,

162
00:08:04,999 --> 00:08:07,667
you can tell them but, otherwise, you don't.

163
00:08:07,999 --> 00:08:10,584
The other thing, if you are actually inside cyberspace,

164
00:08:10,584 --> 00:08:15,292
if you will, it's some kind of an alter ego that's operating there.

165
00:08:15,292 --> 00:08:16,292
Why?

166
00:08:16,292 --> 00:08:17,792
Because you can't go there.

167
00:08:17,792 --> 00:08:18,918
I mean, you have an username or something and it

168
00:08:18,918 --> 00:08:22,999
is what actually transfers through the cyberspace.

169
00:08:22,999 --> 00:08:24,999
So it is a different way to think about it.

170
00:08:24,999 --> 00:08:27,918
The other thing that has made difficult for people to fully accept this is there

171
00:08:27,918 --> 00:08:30,751
is no such thing as time and distance.

172
00:08:30,751 --> 00:08:32,083
There is a funny anecdote.

173
00:08:32,834 --> 00:08:36,667
We were doing a global exercise.

174
00:08:36,667 --> 00:08:38,999
We had people in the Pacific.

175
00:08:38,999 --> 00:08:40,292
We had people in Europe and, of course, people

176
00:08:40,292 --> 00:08:43,918
in several different places in the United States.

177
00:08:44,083 --> 00:08:46,209
We were doing a planning operation.

178
00:08:46,209 --> 00:08:47,083
Of course, everybody was using chatrooms

179
00:08:47,083 --> 00:08:49,209
and they had headsets on.

180
00:08:49,626 --> 00:08:52,417
And one of the people that came into watch this saw these two people

181
00:08:52,417 --> 00:08:55,834
that were right next to each other and they obviously were exchanging

182
00:08:55,834 --> 00:08:58,125
information with one another.

183
00:08:58,125 --> 00:09:00,999
And the observer said, that's odd.

184
00:09:00,999 --> 00:09:03,083
Why doesn't he just turn to the person

185
00:09:03,083 --> 00:09:06,250
next to him and tell him what he wants?

186
00:09:06,584 --> 00:09:09,918
And they said we were kind of flabbergasted.

187
00:09:09,918 --> 00:09:11,999
They didn't full appreciate the fact that there was another 200

188
00:09:11,999 --> 00:09:14,125
people that were working on this project but they were

189
00:09:14,125 --> 00:09:16,501
in all these different places.

190
00:09:16,501 --> 00:09:19,334
So this notion of time and distance is really different.

191
00:09:19,876 --> 00:09:24,999
The extent to have a virtual presence, it allows you to actually work

192
00:09:24,999 --> 00:09:27,375
with someone and if you can break

193
00:09:27,375 --> 00:09:31,999
through the fact that you don't have the actual human contact,

194
00:09:31,999 --> 00:09:36,167
you can almost feel like you're doing that.

195
00:09:36,209 --> 00:09:37,999
There is two other things about it.

196
00:09:37,999 --> 00:09:41,209
One is that cyberspace information becomes a commodity and

197
00:09:41,209 --> 00:09:44,999
as a result we get a lot of information.

198
00:09:44,999 --> 00:09:47,250
We almost get more information than we stand.

199
00:09:47,834 --> 00:09:49,999
Before we used to pay to get information.

200
00:09:49,999 --> 00:09:51,999
Now we pay people to sort our information for us, right,

201
00:09:51,999 --> 00:09:54,167
because you get so much.

202
00:09:54,417 --> 00:09:58,334
And then the last one is this idea of a smart agent.

203
00:09:58,751 --> 00:10:00,751
Once again, this is because you can't actually function

204
00:10:00,751 --> 00:10:04,250
in cyberspace so you have to have an agent do it for you.

205
00:10:05,167 --> 00:10:09,584
An idea if we ever took the smart agent to its full potential,

206
00:10:09,584 --> 00:10:13,999
today let's say you wanted to order something off the Internet,

207
00:10:13,999 --> 00:10:18,334
a tie to match a suit that you had, for example.

208
00:10:18,334 --> 00:10:20,167
Well, you would go on to the Internet.

209
00:10:20,167 --> 00:10:21,918
You would run a search engine.

210
00:10:21,918 --> 00:10:23,501
Find some places that had it.

211
00:10:23,501 --> 00:10:25,000
You might look up the reviews.

212
00:10:25,209 --> 00:10:27,751
And then you would select that tie.

213
00:10:27,751 --> 00:10:29,834
You would work the transaction.

214
00:10:29,876 --> 00:10:32,999
It would then connect you with whoever was going to work

215
00:10:32,999 --> 00:10:34,999
the credit card.

216
00:10:34,999 --> 00:10:37,334
Then you get your tie and it gets mailed to you.

217
00:10:37,334 --> 00:10:38,959
Well, if you had a smart agent doing this,

218
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:41,459
you would actually just launch your smart agent and

219
00:10:41,459 --> 00:10:44,876
the smart agent would then meet with all these other smart agents

220
00:10:44,876 --> 00:10:47,999
for you in cyberspace, go make you the best deal you could find

221
00:10:47,999 --> 00:10:51,959
and then the tie would just show up in your mail, right?

222
00:10:51,999 --> 00:10:54,042
You wouldn't be involved with this at all.

223
00:10:54,292 --> 00:10:55,876
And eventually, I mean, hopefully as a matter

224
00:10:55,876 --> 00:10:57,999
of fact that's where cyberspace will go because you

225
00:10:57,999 --> 00:11:01,417
will fully leverage the capability the network brings.

226
00:11:02,584 --> 00:11:06,792
Again, cyberspace is very powerful and just trying to expose yourself

227
00:11:06,792 --> 00:11:09,999
to a different way to think about it.

228
00:11:09,999 --> 00:11:11,999
Now, this group here would understand this chart

229
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:15,751
more than typical audience that I would talk to.

230
00:11:15,918 --> 00:11:21,083
One of the big challenges we have both in the business community and then

231
00:11:21,083 --> 00:11:25,542
in the government sectors is the way we operate, particularly

232
00:11:25,542 --> 00:11:30,083
in the west, is it is kind of a seniority system.

233
00:11:30,083 --> 00:11:32,751
So you start at the bottom and you work your way up.

234
00:11:32,751 --> 00:11:38,250
And so if you look at the left side there, it's this hierarchical structure.

235
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:41,542
And the notion is that the higher up you are in that structure,

236
00:11:41,542 --> 00:11:45,417
the more power you have, the more value you have.

237
00:11:45,626 --> 00:11:48,501
And you are also better looking or at least that's what everybody that's

238
00:11:48,501 --> 00:11:51,125
at the lower level tells you, right?

239
00:11:51,542 --> 00:11:55,999
Well, in cyberspace, it doesn't work that way.

240
00:11:55,999 --> 00:11:57,125
It is a network.

241
00:11:57,125 --> 00:11:58,125
It is a meritocracy.

242
00:11:58,125 --> 00:11:59,125
There is no top.

243
00:11:59,125 --> 00:12:00,125
There is no bottom.

244
00:12:00,209 --> 00:12:03,751
Your real power comes from how many connections you have.

245
00:12:03,751 --> 00:12:06,459
If you have a lot of information but you have no connections,

246
00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:08,959
you also have no power.

247
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:11,876
The more connections you have, the more powerful you are.

248
00:12:12,417 --> 00:12:14,834
It is a meritocracy, so you can have a lot

249
00:12:14,834 --> 00:12:17,999
of connections but if you all of a sudden kind of get lazy

250
00:12:17,999 --> 00:12:21,751
and you are no longer contributing to the network, then your value

251
00:12:21,751 --> 00:12:24,959
to that network goes down dramatically.

252
00:12:25,125 --> 00:12:27,125
So that's very different.

253
00:12:27,125 --> 00:12:30,250
Well, the problem that we have is that the people who have

254
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,999
after many years have risen to some level

255
00:12:32,999 --> 00:12:37,417
by the left hand side model are frightened by the right hand model

256
00:12:37,417 --> 00:12:40,250
and want to push back on it.

257
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:43,167
The reality is you don't have a choice.

258
00:12:43,167 --> 00:12:45,584
When you are operating in a global system, it is going

259
00:12:45,584 --> 00:12:47,999
to operate like a network.

260
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:49,999
You can't force it into a hierarchy.

261
00:12:49,999 --> 00:12:51,167
We kind of learned that with the automobile industry,

262
00:12:51,167 --> 00:12:52,626
by the way.

263
00:12:52,751 --> 00:12:53,999
We thought because we could control

264
00:12:53,999 --> 00:12:57,584
all the automobile sales that went on in the states they didn't need

265
00:12:57,584 --> 00:12:59,999
to do all the things from a quality standpoint,

266
00:12:59,999 --> 00:13:02,918
price control and everything else.

267
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:07,918
And then the global market came in and the U.S.

268
00:13:07,918 --> 00:13:09,584
auto industry almost failed.

269
00:13:09,584 --> 00:13:11,417
It was a very hierarchical approach.

270
00:13:11,584 --> 00:13:13,667
They adapted the same kind of methods.

271
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:15,667
It became a global kind of a business again and now

272
00:13:15,667 --> 00:13:19,751
they are starting to thrive and they are doing very well.

273
00:13:19,959 --> 00:13:22,959
So understanding that you can't always force the model to operate

274
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:25,459
the way you want is important.

275
00:13:25,459 --> 00:13:27,999
But for this group, understanding that you're fighting

276
00:13:27,999 --> 00:13:31,918
the model on the left but you need to keep doing that and recognize that

277
00:13:31,918 --> 00:13:35,083
you're operating this network but there are people that want

278
00:13:35,083 --> 00:13:37,209
to connect with you.

279
00:13:38,834 --> 00:13:40,959
This should look very familiar to you.

280
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:44,375
This is the traditional way people look I say "they," the Department

281
00:13:44,375 --> 00:13:46,959
of Defense this is how they would look

282
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:49,999
at enterprise network protection.

283
00:13:50,542 --> 00:13:53,334
In the interest of time, I don't want to walk through it.

284
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:57,626
There was a national strategy for cyberspace ops that came

285
00:13:57,626 --> 00:13:59,250
out in 2006.

286
00:13:59,626 --> 00:14:01,292
When they were looking to figure out how to implement it,

287
00:14:01,292 --> 00:14:03,167
they said what are the difference things we need

288
00:14:03,167 --> 00:14:04,834
to deal with?

289
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:07,999
They realized the attack vectors that are involved

290
00:14:07,999 --> 00:14:10,999
in doing this are tremendous.

291
00:14:10,999 --> 00:14:11,792
I mean, there are all these different ways that you can

292
00:14:11,792 --> 00:14:12,999
get in.

293
00:14:13,375 --> 00:14:15,209
This community knows better than most all the different ways you can

294
00:14:15,209 --> 00:14:16,501
get in.

295
00:14:16,667 --> 00:14:20,459
One of the funny things, if you want to call it funny, is they kind

296
00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:24,417
of ignored the social part of it which is probably a good 80%

297
00:14:24,417 --> 00:14:26,999
of the attacks come from.

298
00:14:27,667 --> 00:14:29,999
When you look at some of the things they have

299
00:14:29,999 --> 00:14:32,918
with the way we try to law enforcement, the CDNR, that's

300
00:14:32,918 --> 00:14:36,334
the Commuter Defense Network Response capability.

301
00:14:36,999 --> 00:14:39,959
So if you launch an attack, then you would have some kind

302
00:14:39,959 --> 00:14:41,626
of a response.

303
00:14:41,876 --> 00:14:45,083
But the reality is when people look at this, they say, you know, that's

304
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:47,334
an awful lot of different ways that somebody can

305
00:14:47,334 --> 00:14:50,501
get at me so it must be impossible to protect.

306
00:14:50,501 --> 00:14:52,501
And realistically, this community would know,

307
00:14:52,501 --> 00:14:55,999
if you take this pure approach, it is going to be impossible

308
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:59,083
because the advantage goes to the offense in something

309
00:14:59,083 --> 00:15:03,542
like this and you can't possibly defend against every possible thing that's

310
00:15:03,542 --> 00:15:05,459
going to happen.

311
00:15:05,999 --> 00:15:11,417
So that's why I'm suggesting we need some alternatives to this.

312
00:15:11,417 --> 00:15:14,751
We need to have some different ways to think about this, and I asked

313
00:15:14,751 --> 00:15:18,209
if I could talk to this group because if there was anyone

314
00:15:18,209 --> 00:15:23,501
to be able to come up with groups, it would come out of this group.

315
00:15:23,501 --> 00:15:25,918
You are phenomenal at solving problems.

316
00:15:25,918 --> 00:15:30,375
There is one other thing I just kind of wanted to introduce in terms

317
00:15:30,375 --> 00:15:36,792
of the problem set here, and that is if you look on the far left side of this,

318
00:15:36,792 --> 00:15:39,834
you see the DOD networks.

319
00:15:39,999 --> 00:15:42,999
They're controlled and operated a certain way.

320
00:15:42,999 --> 00:15:44,999
They are somewhat closed.

321
00:15:44,999 --> 00:15:47,167
They have done a lot of work to reduce the gateways

322
00:15:47,167 --> 00:15:50,083
to the Internet but there are still gateways.

323
00:15:50,999 --> 00:15:53,999
But there is an awful lot of information that's available

324
00:15:53,999 --> 00:15:56,250
from a protect standpoint.

325
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:58,584
They have got a lot of intelligence and intelligence comes from a lot

326
00:15:58,584 --> 00:16:00,292
of different means.

327
00:16:00,542 --> 00:16:03,834
And that intelligence is not widely shared.

328
00:16:03,834 --> 00:16:05,667
Now, they extend some of that to the other government networks

329
00:16:05,667 --> 00:16:07,667
and they brought in the Defense Industrial Base,

330
00:16:07,667 --> 00:16:09,999
that's what the DIB stands for.

331
00:16:10,125 --> 00:16:14,667
Because they said our adversaries are going after the defense contractors who

332
00:16:14,667 --> 00:16:17,167
are not as well defended.

333
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:19,250
Based on that previous model, they are going to have

334
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:22,083
to have more information to protect themselves.

335
00:16:22,542 --> 00:16:24,959
As you move a little bit further to the right, now you get

336
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:27,584
into where you are dealing with state still government,

337
00:16:27,584 --> 00:16:30,334
you have state and local governments.

338
00:16:30,334 --> 00:16:31,751
And they get information but they don't get

339
00:16:31,751 --> 00:16:33,417
as much information as they are getting

340
00:16:33,417 --> 00:16:35,083
on the federal side and they don't get

341
00:16:35,083 --> 00:16:37,417
the same levels of protection.

342
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:41,083
Of course, you have the Einstein and things like that that they've tried

343
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:43,083
to put in place to do that.

344
00:16:43,083 --> 00:16:45,709
They have done a lot of work for ISACs for information sharing

345
00:16:45,709 --> 00:16:50,876
and made a lot of progress but, again, less information available to you.

346
00:16:50,876 --> 00:16:53,751
And then you get to the far right which is everybody else.

347
00:16:54,083 --> 00:16:57,125
What's interesting is that the information that's now becoming

348
00:16:57,125 --> 00:17:00,918
available there, it doesn't have some of the sources that, say,

349
00:17:00,918 --> 00:17:05,417
the Department of Defense has but the sources are really good.

350
00:17:05,876 --> 00:17:08,209
And as a result in the commercial industry,

351
00:17:08,209 --> 00:17:11,999
people are going and being able to obtain product that

352
00:17:11,999 --> 00:17:15,999
is really do provide a level of protection.

353
00:17:15,999 --> 00:17:19,417
But it is still based on this old model, I guess I would say.

354
00:17:19,876 --> 00:17:22,667
One other thing I wanted to show here is which goes back

355
00:17:22,667 --> 00:17:26,792
to the nuclear part, you get all the way to the bottom where it talks

356
00:17:26,792 --> 00:17:29,417
about the weapons of mass destruction you may

357
00:17:29,417 --> 00:17:33,083
or may not be happy to know none of those operate on a network,

358
00:17:33,083 --> 00:17:35,709
as you would think of it.

359
00:17:35,709 --> 00:17:36,999
They all use circuits.

360
00:17:37,459 --> 00:17:40,459
And that's done for obvious reasons.

361
00:17:40,584 --> 00:17:42,959
They are worried about somebody getting in.

362
00:17:42,959 --> 00:17:44,999
The other thing is it is highly redundant.

363
00:17:44,999 --> 00:17:48,083
So it's not the necessarily the most efficient way, but it

364
00:17:48,083 --> 00:17:53,417
is a time proven way to be able to do to protect a particular piece

365
00:17:53,417 --> 00:17:58,667
of information or a capability that you have to have.

366
00:17:59,375 --> 00:18:01,999
I said I want to give you two different models

367
00:18:01,999 --> 00:18:03,584
to look at.

368
00:18:03,751 --> 00:18:05,959
And what I would really like to do is hopefully stimulate someone

369
00:18:05,959 --> 00:18:08,334
to come back and say: Have you come about this model and come

370
00:18:08,334 --> 00:18:10,209
up with a third model.

371
00:18:10,334 --> 00:18:13,876
This one was actually developed by an Air Force scientific advisory

372
00:18:13,876 --> 00:18:16,334
board studied back in 2008.

373
00:18:16,751 --> 00:18:21,667
Their approach to this, if I take a few minutes to explain the chart,

374
00:18:21,667 --> 00:18:24,584
is they took the ISO layer.

375
00:18:24,584 --> 00:18:27,292
If you look in the middle you will see the ISO layer identified there,

376
00:18:27,292 --> 00:18:30,542
but they put them together so you don't see 7.

377
00:18:30,542 --> 00:18:34,999
They put devices and linkages together, hardware systems together.

378
00:18:35,167 --> 00:18:37,083
But then they added two layers to it.

379
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:39,709
They put a human organization and mission layer.

380
00:18:39,709 --> 00:18:41,459
They started with that foundation.

381
00:18:41,459 --> 00:18:45,751
They said, what do the attacks look like on those different layers?

382
00:18:45,751 --> 00:18:48,083
And so what you see on the left are the things that they did to try

383
00:18:48,083 --> 00:18:51,626
to characterize how those attacks would be done.

384
00:18:51,626 --> 00:18:55,167
And when you look there the reason I put this attacker photo,

385
00:18:55,167 --> 00:18:58,999
if you are going to deal with those different types of attacks,

386
00:18:58,999 --> 00:19:02,626
you have to focus on the attacker and the intelligence on how

387
00:19:02,626 --> 00:19:04,999
the attacker operates.

388
00:19:04,999 --> 00:19:09,999
The other thing they said is what is the effect of the attacks on the users.

389
00:19:10,667 --> 00:19:13,292
You see those listed on the left hand side.

390
00:19:13,417 --> 00:19:16,083
There are high levels, you get confusion,

391
00:19:16,083 --> 00:19:20,876
and it disrupts our ability to do command and control.

392
00:19:20,876 --> 00:19:23,083
At the bottom, you get performance loss.

393
00:19:23,083 --> 00:19:26,125
You lose your communications, it completely malfunctions.

394
00:19:26,584 --> 00:19:28,792
The reason they thought it would be useful

395
00:19:28,792 --> 00:19:32,999
on the right side that's almost completely done by the operator.

396
00:19:33,209 --> 00:19:36,999
We refer to it as resiliency or mission assurance.

397
00:19:37,292 --> 00:19:40,999
So what they said is if you are going to try to deal with this problem,

398
00:19:40,999 --> 00:19:43,959
you would need to look at this thing and break it

399
00:19:43,959 --> 00:19:46,083
into component parts.

400
00:19:46,083 --> 00:19:47,751
I don't know how many in the room are engineers,

401
00:19:47,751 --> 00:19:49,999
but that's how engineers think.

402
00:19:49,999 --> 00:19:52,667
You take a complex problem and break it into parts.

403
00:19:52,667 --> 00:19:54,999
And so they start trying to look at this thing.

404
00:19:54,999 --> 00:19:57,834
So on the left side you have this intelligence and attack response that's

405
00:19:57,834 --> 00:20:00,999
traditional with your network security.

406
00:20:01,125 --> 00:20:03,375
You have this mission assurance which has been a traditional way that

407
00:20:03,375 --> 00:20:05,792
the military in particular but businesses do the same thing,

408
00:20:05,792 --> 00:20:07,542
business resiliency.

409
00:20:07,626 --> 00:20:09,417
One of the things the business community,

410
00:20:09,417 --> 00:20:11,999
particularly the financial community, does that we don't

411
00:20:11,999 --> 00:20:13,751
for the most part do with our networks

412
00:20:13,751 --> 00:20:15,792
is transaction control.

413
00:20:16,083 --> 00:20:18,417
So there is this anonymity on the network

414
00:20:18,417 --> 00:20:22,334
but if you put controls on the network, then typically it's

415
00:20:22,334 --> 00:20:25,459
a ledger/journal type approach.

416
00:20:25,459 --> 00:20:28,501
But it makes it more difficult for something for a change to be made,

417
00:20:28,501 --> 00:20:32,250
alteration to be made without it being detected.

418
00:20:33,083 --> 00:20:35,999
That's how they and a lot of businesses have those kinds

419
00:20:35,999 --> 00:20:37,584
of controls.

420
00:20:37,584 --> 00:20:39,999
That's how you avoid embezzlement, by the way.

421
00:20:39,999 --> 00:20:42,042
But then we put this other thing over here.

422
00:20:42,042 --> 00:20:44,083
We said it would be a proactive defense.

423
00:20:44,626 --> 00:20:49,042
What the Scientific Advisory Board said if you look at these different layers,

424
00:20:49,042 --> 00:20:53,292
if you think of them as targets, if this were a military problem,

425
00:20:53,292 --> 00:20:56,876
you would look at those targets and say: What can I do

426
00:20:56,876 --> 00:21:01,334
to make it difficult for my adversary to be successful?

427
00:21:01,709 --> 00:21:04,125
There is three typical things you can do.

428
00:21:04,125 --> 00:21:05,125
You can harden it.

429
00:21:05,125 --> 00:21:10,250
You can maneuver it or obfuscate it like Stealth or make it camouflaged so it

430
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:12,417
is hard to see.

431
00:21:12,959 --> 00:21:18,501
They said perhaps we should identify some of these really critical areas.

432
00:21:18,501 --> 00:21:21,709
And that's how we should be looking to spend our resources.

433
00:21:21,709 --> 00:21:23,999
But part of the problem is that we have not had a lot of good,

434
00:21:23,999 --> 00:21:27,083
proactive ways to deal with this developed.

435
00:21:27,501 --> 00:21:30,542
I wanted to show you some of the things that have been done.

436
00:21:30,542 --> 00:21:33,501
If you look from a purely network security

437
00:21:33,501 --> 00:21:38,334
standpoint and you look at this left hand side there,

438
00:21:38,334 --> 00:21:43,999
what we can do is say, well, in addition to the normal thing,

439
00:21:43,999 --> 00:21:49,250
they've set up these virtual machine sandboxes.

440
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:51,584
They have done things to monitor user behavior to look

441
00:21:51,584 --> 00:21:55,292
to try to detect to say it's not the right person on there, some kind

442
00:21:55,292 --> 00:21:57,999
of two factor authentication.

443
00:21:58,292 --> 00:22:00,667
There has been transaction controls primarily

444
00:22:00,667 --> 00:22:05,167
in the business community because it fits for them easily.

445
00:22:05,709 --> 00:22:09,626
There's products out that will monitor your registry and,

446
00:22:09,626 --> 00:22:13,501
for example in fact, in the Department of Defense now, it

447
00:22:13,501 --> 00:22:16,999
is called host based security system.

448
00:22:16,999 --> 00:22:18,834
When you first connect to a network, it actually looks to see

449
00:22:18,834 --> 00:22:22,667
if your registry looks the same as it did before and it alerts.

450
00:22:22,667 --> 00:22:24,709
It doesn't do anything to fix it, but it alerts you that your registry

451
00:22:24,709 --> 00:22:26,167
looks different.

452
00:22:26,834 --> 00:22:30,626
You can do things with the hypervisor that operates how

453
00:22:30,626 --> 00:22:34,375
the monitoring system behaves, to see if someone tried

454
00:22:34,375 --> 00:22:37,167
to put something in there.

455
00:22:37,292 --> 00:22:40,876
And then at this lower levels, they can put in resilient capabilities,

456
00:22:40,876 --> 00:22:45,876
if it takes out a router, there is another pathway, that type of thing.

457
00:22:46,542 --> 00:22:49,999
But these are still the fairly traditional approaches.

458
00:22:49,999 --> 00:22:53,709
If you want to try to take a look at how you deal with these targets,

459
00:22:53,709 --> 00:22:55,999
these are some of the things and a lot

460
00:22:55,999 --> 00:22:59,375
of them become more process oriented.

461
00:22:59,876 --> 00:23:02,209
If you found some ways to put some technology behind it,

462
00:23:02,209 --> 00:23:04,542
it could be very useful.

463
00:23:04,542 --> 00:23:06,626
So the idea of the two person controls, that's another nuke part

464
00:23:06,626 --> 00:23:08,667
of this thing which is one of the ways that

465
00:23:08,667 --> 00:23:12,999
they make sure that some single person can't do something with a nuke.

466
00:23:12,999 --> 00:23:14,999
You can't do anything unless you have two people and they always put

467
00:23:14,999 --> 00:23:17,999
the controls far enough part that you can't possibly do both of them

468
00:23:17,999 --> 00:23:19,626
at the same time.

469
00:23:19,626 --> 00:23:22,375
If you are trying to deal with people understanding

470
00:23:22,375 --> 00:23:25,501
the target so if you're a good hacker and you go

471
00:23:25,501 --> 00:23:28,667
in and start looking at a system and start doing

472
00:23:28,667 --> 00:23:32,834
all of your reconnaissance, if that system changes, they rotated

473
00:23:32,834 --> 00:23:35,999
the process, they changed the system or process,

474
00:23:35,999 --> 00:23:39,083
then you have to start over again.

475
00:23:39,167 --> 00:23:40,999
That's considered one of the proactive ways that you

476
00:23:40,999 --> 00:23:42,501
can defend.

477
00:23:42,501 --> 00:23:44,709
That's a maneuver type or maneuver thing.

478
00:23:45,334 --> 00:23:50,083
The session controls, they put a lot of there's some different products that

479
00:23:50,083 --> 00:23:54,999
work with session controls now that look to see if a session's been hijacked

480
00:23:54,999 --> 00:23:58,959
and they basically can terminate the sessions and minimize loss

481
00:23:58,959 --> 00:24:02,999
of data or damage to the system when they do that.

482
00:24:03,334 --> 00:24:07,542
There has been some things done with operating system obfuscation.

483
00:24:08,709 --> 00:24:11,417
It actually looks like it has a lot of promise.

484
00:24:11,417 --> 00:24:13,083
The only reason you don't see much of it being done

485
00:24:13,083 --> 00:24:15,751
is that once you do that, the people administering

486
00:24:15,751 --> 00:24:18,375
the network have to know a lot more about the systems

487
00:24:18,375 --> 00:24:21,667
to be able to deal with it because it is going to look different

488
00:24:21,667 --> 00:24:23,626
to them every time.

489
00:24:23,626 --> 00:24:24,918
They have to know kind of what's behind the curtain

490
00:24:24,918 --> 00:24:26,501
to make it work.

491
00:24:26,999 --> 00:24:31,542
And then the bottom there you see the banks do a lot of this, by the way.

492
00:24:31,999 --> 00:24:33,834
They shift their hardware.

493
00:24:33,834 --> 00:24:36,542
So by rotating hardware is the same thing.

494
00:24:36,542 --> 00:24:38,876
When you are trying to if a hacker is trying to come in, one time

495
00:24:38,876 --> 00:24:42,709
they go and it is one piece of hardware, another time it is a different piece

496
00:24:42,709 --> 00:24:45,959
of hardware complicates the problem for you.

497
00:24:46,125 --> 00:24:50,334
The other thing they try to work with is device diversity.

498
00:24:50,542 --> 00:24:52,709
It is not what they do in the Department of Defense,

499
00:24:52,709 --> 00:24:55,999
by the way, which is a little bit problematic.

500
00:24:55,999 --> 00:24:57,459
They want to make things standard so they are

501
00:24:57,459 --> 00:25:00,459
all the same, right, but no diversity.

502
00:25:00,459 --> 00:25:04,083
If something goes wrong with one of them, then they're all going to fail.

503
00:25:04,083 --> 00:25:04,999
But in the business community, I think they have been

504
00:25:04,999 --> 00:25:07,209
a little smarter about that so you see a lot

505
00:25:07,209 --> 00:25:10,792
of diversity with machines, operating systems, routers, all parts

506
00:25:10,792 --> 00:25:12,501
of the network.

507
00:25:12,876 --> 00:25:15,999
That's one way to think about the proactive defense.

508
00:25:17,083 --> 00:25:20,584
I bring this to this community to look at because you might have some ideas

509
00:25:20,584 --> 00:25:23,083
for how technology could aid this.

510
00:25:23,083 --> 00:25:24,999
But when you take a look at how you do things

511
00:25:24,999 --> 00:25:29,209
from a mission assurance standpoint, it typically involves having some type

512
00:25:29,209 --> 00:25:31,083
of redundancy.

513
00:25:31,083 --> 00:25:34,250
So if you are trying to determine if someone has done something

514
00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:37,834
with your sensors, if you have more than one sensor,

515
00:25:37,834 --> 00:25:41,667
you can compare them and at least you know that somebody's

516
00:25:41,667 --> 00:25:44,250
done something with that.

517
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:46,250
In an airplane, that's pretty typical.

518
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:47,999
They have all of the critical flight controls

519
00:25:47,999 --> 00:25:52,751
all have a backup and one you do all the time, to check to make sure

520
00:25:52,751 --> 00:25:54,999
they are the same.

521
00:25:55,125 --> 00:25:57,999
If they were a different, then you try to figure out which one is correct

522
00:25:57,999 --> 00:25:59,999
and which one is wrong.

523
00:26:00,292 --> 00:26:02,292
You assume in most military operations that you are

524
00:26:02,292 --> 00:26:05,125
going to lose communications so they put in what they call

525
00:26:05,125 --> 00:26:07,751
a lost communication processes.

526
00:26:08,584 --> 00:26:12,209
If you put those kind of things together, that's another way you can deal

527
00:26:12,209 --> 00:26:15,626
particularly with some type of an attack that actually caused your

528
00:26:15,626 --> 00:26:17,334
coms to go out.

529
00:26:18,834 --> 00:26:23,999
The redundant type apps means instead of using just one particular

530
00:26:23,999 --> 00:26:26,999
application to do whatever your process

531
00:26:26,999 --> 00:26:29,959
is you had more than one.

532
00:26:29,959 --> 00:26:33,999
By the way, in the Department of Defense, that's enigma to them.

533
00:26:33,999 --> 00:26:36,792
They said we will standardize and have one.

534
00:26:37,334 --> 00:26:39,751
Business community says we will have three or four

535
00:26:39,751 --> 00:26:43,751
because if one breaks or quits working, I want to have a backup.

536
00:26:45,334 --> 00:26:48,501
They started dealing with some of the attacks.

537
00:26:48,876 --> 00:26:51,709
I wanted to go to the talk yesterday that was talking

538
00:26:51,709 --> 00:26:54,999
about some of the ways to beat some of the systems for dealing

539
00:26:54,999 --> 00:26:58,834
with the DDoS attacks and I wasn't able to make it.

540
00:26:59,417 --> 00:27:02,083
But they have some things that they put in place there that

541
00:27:02,083 --> 00:27:05,626
at least would try to mitigate some of those effects.

542
00:27:05,918 --> 00:27:07,334
And then when you get down to the hardware layer,

543
00:27:07,334 --> 00:27:10,626
the only way to do that is to have more than one path.

544
00:27:10,709 --> 00:27:13,584
One of the strange things about people when they talk

545
00:27:13,584 --> 00:27:17,250
about cloud computing and things like that, cloud competing is great

546
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:20,125
but if you only got one circuit leading to the cloud,

547
00:27:20,125 --> 00:27:22,876
then you only have a circuit.

548
00:27:22,999 --> 00:27:24,999
So if you don't figure out a way to leverage

549
00:27:24,999 --> 00:27:28,209
the cloud and you don't have multiple pathways into the cloud or

550
00:27:28,209 --> 00:27:31,751
into that network, then you have a limitation.

551
00:27:31,999 --> 00:27:36,167
So that's this one model that I guess I'm hoping that some

552
00:27:36,167 --> 00:27:40,834
of you would have some good ideas about how to do that better

553
00:27:40,834 --> 00:27:45,417
or some technical ways to take advantage of that.

554
00:27:45,751 --> 00:27:51,250
This next one is one that was actually put out by DHS.

555
00:27:51,250 --> 00:27:56,250
And their idea was they were going to try to teach or treat cyberspace

556
00:27:56,250 --> 00:27:58,584
as an ecosystem.

557
00:27:58,584 --> 00:28:01,834
And the thought there was you were going to have a static defense

558
00:28:01,834 --> 00:28:05,959
but you are also going to have this dynamic defense.

559
00:28:05,999 --> 00:28:07,999
And if you look up there, the things that they have

560
00:28:07,999 --> 00:28:10,999
under "prevent," those are pretty typical.

561
00:28:11,999 --> 00:28:15,334
They insert a couple of other things that they would

562
00:28:15,334 --> 00:28:19,083
like to see, like the moving target idea.

563
00:28:19,083 --> 00:28:20,834
I talked about it in the other one.

564
00:28:20,999 --> 00:28:23,083
A big part of this thing is you want to have a way

565
00:28:23,083 --> 00:28:25,292
to detect something happened.

566
00:28:25,584 --> 00:28:28,459
For the most part, most of the major attacks that occur

567
00:28:28,459 --> 00:28:32,125
whether it's in the commercial sector or it's in government,

568
00:28:32,125 --> 00:28:34,999
it happens because they actually start seeing

569
00:28:34,999 --> 00:28:36,751
the impact.

570
00:28:36,751 --> 00:28:38,584
And by that point, it is so far down the road that it

571
00:28:38,584 --> 00:28:40,999
is very difficult to contain.

572
00:28:41,083 --> 00:28:44,626
So trying to put processes in for detection gets to be important.

573
00:28:44,999 --> 00:28:48,209
That's still considered kind of the static piece of this thing.

574
00:28:48,209 --> 00:28:51,999
On the dynamic side, they want to have a lot of information sharing.

575
00:28:52,083 --> 00:28:53,083
Why?

576
00:28:53,083 --> 00:28:56,751
Because if you are only looking at small points, it's one thing

577
00:28:56,751 --> 00:28:59,167
to be able to sneak under the radar

578
00:28:59,167 --> 00:29:02,876
because you avoid crossing a level.

579
00:29:02,876 --> 00:29:04,999
But if you are able to bring in from multiple places and you say,

580
00:29:04,999 --> 00:29:07,959
hey, there is this kind of an odd behavior, abnormality here,

581
00:29:07,959 --> 00:29:10,834
same thing here and same thing here, now you say maybe there

582
00:29:10,834 --> 00:29:13,417
is something going on and by combining the information,

583
00:29:13,417 --> 00:29:15,501
you can leverage that.

584
00:29:15,876 --> 00:29:18,334
When you see that, then they want to have processes in place

585
00:29:18,334 --> 00:29:21,292
to respond and then as soon as they can kind of put things

586
00:29:21,292 --> 00:29:25,334
under control, then they want to have processes to recover.

587
00:29:25,626 --> 00:29:28,999
Part of it that's recovered, by the way and it is kind of interesting.

588
00:29:29,626 --> 00:29:33,999
When talking to some people from 9/11, they said they thought that 9/11 was

589
00:29:33,999 --> 00:29:37,250
the first cyber attack and the reason was nobody could talk

590
00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:39,999
to anyone after it happened.

591
00:29:39,999 --> 00:29:40,999
It took out no one could talk on the cell phone

592
00:29:40,999 --> 00:29:44,250
because everyone was trying to talk at the same time.

593
00:29:44,918 --> 00:29:46,792
The towers went down.

594
00:29:46,792 --> 00:29:49,334
They took out some of the PBX systems.

595
00:29:49,709 --> 00:29:52,083
So com virtual stopped in New York City at a time when

596
00:29:52,083 --> 00:29:54,334
they really needed it.

597
00:29:54,334 --> 00:29:55,501
And even the first responders were having

598
00:29:55,501 --> 00:29:57,999
difficulty with communications.

599
00:29:58,083 --> 00:30:01,709
Something similar with Katrina in Louisiana.

600
00:30:01,999 --> 00:30:05,999
They actually saw where there was a problem occurring with one

601
00:30:05,999 --> 00:30:08,999
of the levee breaches, but they didn't have a way

602
00:30:08,999 --> 00:30:12,959
to communicate because they lost they had lost the power and,

603
00:30:12,959 --> 00:30:16,042
once again they didn't realize this.

604
00:30:16,083 --> 00:30:18,999
When they lost their PBX system, the cell phones at that time were

605
00:30:18,999 --> 00:30:21,334
all tied into the PBX system.

606
00:30:21,501 --> 00:30:23,584
Once they lost that, they couldn't communicate so their

607
00:30:23,584 --> 00:30:25,999
ability to respond was lost.

608
00:30:26,876 --> 00:30:31,834
So a lot of this is having courses of action that get you up very quickly

609
00:30:31,834 --> 00:30:36,459
to where at least you have a capacity to do these public safety types

610
00:30:36,459 --> 00:30:38,083
of things.

611
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:43,375
But you see at the bottom, they want to try to establish a trusted broker.

612
00:30:43,375 --> 00:30:45,417
That's what they try to do with these information sharing analysis

613
00:30:45,417 --> 00:30:48,626
centers, these ISACs that they have established.

614
00:30:48,626 --> 00:30:55,999
So we did a workshop, the Cyber Innovation Center for DHS.

615
00:30:55,999 --> 00:30:58,626
And we brought some people in from industry.

616
00:30:58,626 --> 00:31:02,083
We brought people in from academia and government

617
00:31:02,083 --> 00:31:03,959
and DHS.

618
00:31:04,250 --> 00:31:07,918
And we actually tried to look at some different situations that were

619
00:31:07,918 --> 00:31:11,250
would be dealing with a first of course, DHS is interested

620
00:31:11,250 --> 00:31:13,918
in a hurricane type thing.

621
00:31:13,999 --> 00:31:18,083
So we were doing a couple different scenarios that might

622
00:31:18,083 --> 00:31:21,459
be a DHS type operation where cyberspace

623
00:31:21,459 --> 00:31:23,999
would be affected.

624
00:31:23,999 --> 00:31:25,083
And we started looking to see what would be

625
00:31:25,083 --> 00:31:27,501
the impediments to doing this.

626
00:31:27,501 --> 00:31:30,083
And I got pages and pages of the things that they highlighted,

627
00:31:30,083 --> 00:31:32,999
but a few things just to highlight that I have here

628
00:31:32,999 --> 00:31:35,999
and my goal is not to read this to you because I want

629
00:31:35,999 --> 00:31:38,918
to leave some time for questions.

630
00:31:38,918 --> 00:31:42,709
But bottom line was that even when we had these experts in the room,

631
00:31:42,709 --> 00:31:48,501
it was very difficult to get them to think beyond the protect piece.

632
00:31:48,834 --> 00:31:51,459
We would tell them, it didn't work.

633
00:31:51,459 --> 00:31:52,999
We've lost cyberspace.

634
00:31:52,999 --> 00:31:55,167
And that was one they would go back and fight.

635
00:31:55,167 --> 00:31:56,292
No, it didn't happen.

636
00:31:56,292 --> 00:31:58,999
It did happen, you have to deal with it now.

637
00:31:59,083 --> 00:32:02,667
And that mind set makes it very difficult to get these other parts resourced

638
00:32:02,667 --> 00:32:05,959
because, you know, the government, businesses for that matter,

639
00:32:05,959 --> 00:32:08,209
they don't want to spend money for things that

640
00:32:08,209 --> 00:32:11,792
they don't think are going to happen obviously.

641
00:32:11,876 --> 00:32:13,999
So part of the things we have been trying to do,

642
00:32:13,999 --> 00:32:16,834
the DEF CON community does a great job of this which

643
00:32:16,834 --> 00:32:20,250
is highlighting the fact that it's if someone really wants to get

644
00:32:20,250 --> 00:32:23,709
into your network, they're going to get in.

645
00:32:23,709 --> 00:32:24,999
And we keep trying to reinforce this with people

646
00:32:24,999 --> 00:32:27,334
in government and in business.

647
00:32:27,667 --> 00:32:32,292
But then to get them to actually do the resources is really difficult.

648
00:32:33,667 --> 00:32:37,083
The balancing piece that you see there really has to do with the fact

649
00:32:37,083 --> 00:32:41,542
they always want to put the money into the protection which is good.

650
00:32:41,542 --> 00:32:44,584
We've argued that if you assume that the protection

651
00:32:44,584 --> 00:32:48,459
is going to fail, there's some smart things that you can

652
00:32:48,459 --> 00:32:51,999
do to set the stage in advance so that your ability

653
00:32:51,999 --> 00:32:56,709
to basically respond, minimize the impact and quickly recover would

654
00:32:56,709 --> 00:32:58,417
be helpful.

655
00:32:58,751 --> 00:33:01,999
We then talked about some things from a detection standpoint that there's

656
00:33:01,999 --> 00:33:05,667
a lot of noise on most of the enterprise networks.

657
00:33:05,667 --> 00:33:06,959
It makes it difficult.

658
00:33:07,083 --> 00:33:09,876
A lot of the things they have, the automatic detection mechanisms

659
00:33:09,876 --> 00:33:14,125
throw out so many false alarms that it is very difficult to deal with.

660
00:33:14,542 --> 00:33:15,999
This is actually one of the things to go back

661
00:33:15,999 --> 00:33:18,209
to the operational community.

662
00:33:18,209 --> 00:33:20,792
So whether it is a business or the government, people using

663
00:33:20,792 --> 00:33:24,292
the system say we really need to have you not do these things

664
00:33:24,292 --> 00:33:27,083
because when you do that, it throws so many junk

665
00:33:27,083 --> 00:33:32,292
on the network that we can't really tell when something is going wrong.

666
00:33:32,999 --> 00:33:35,999
There was a lot of interest in trying to set up these automatic systems

667
00:33:35,999 --> 00:33:37,792
to where the machines would automatically

668
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:40,083
respond to deal with these things.

669
00:33:40,125 --> 00:33:43,542
And there's some problems with doing that, particularly some

670
00:33:43,542 --> 00:33:47,375
of the drastic or draconian response you would have.

671
00:33:47,375 --> 00:33:50,876
So one of the things we discussed is that you really you need

672
00:33:50,876 --> 00:33:53,626
to have a way that you can keep a human

673
00:33:53,626 --> 00:33:58,209
in this decision making loop but be able to basically be operated

674
00:33:58,209 --> 00:34:01,667
in a sensor response system that basically goes

675
00:34:01,667 --> 00:34:04,667
at the speed of information.

676
00:34:05,792 --> 00:34:08,083
And then, finally, I guess I actually talked

677
00:34:08,083 --> 00:34:11,083
about the last one there, about balancing this is really

678
00:34:11,083 --> 00:34:13,999
for the people that figure out where you should spend

679
00:34:13,999 --> 00:34:15,626
your money.

680
00:34:15,626 --> 00:34:18,334
They need to have a process to figure out how to do that.

681
00:34:18,959 --> 00:34:22,792
So now this is my appeal to this community here.

682
00:34:22,792 --> 00:34:26,959
When you look at this workforce, these are the different elements that are

683
00:34:26,959 --> 00:34:29,999
involved in doing this workforce.

684
00:34:30,083 --> 00:34:32,709
And if I went across this room, you'd see that parts

685
00:34:32,709 --> 00:34:36,959
of you are involved in all these different places here.

686
00:34:36,999 --> 00:34:39,125
And we do a lot of stuff looking at trying to eliminate

687
00:34:39,125 --> 00:34:42,667
the vulnerabilities and we do a lot of things trying to figure out what

688
00:34:42,667 --> 00:34:44,375
the threats are.

689
00:34:44,501 --> 00:34:46,375
But there are some really good opportunities

690
00:34:46,375 --> 00:34:49,584
in the software assurance, in the parts that actually look

691
00:34:49,584 --> 00:34:52,999
at the resiliency of the transaction controls.

692
00:34:52,999 --> 00:34:55,542
And then one of the things we can do to help make the users

693
00:34:55,542 --> 00:34:59,334
of the network more accountable for their actions and more careful

694
00:34:59,334 --> 00:35:03,667
about their processes, I bring this to you because I think this community

695
00:35:03,667 --> 00:35:07,501
could actually implement this and make this work.

696
00:35:08,167 --> 00:35:10,876
So that's the workforce part of it.

697
00:35:10,876 --> 00:35:13,125
The leader part of this is kind of interesting.

698
00:35:13,125 --> 00:35:18,626
This is a typical model for any kind of a pyramid type organization, right?

699
00:35:18,626 --> 00:35:20,167
But you have all these different functional specialties

700
00:35:20,167 --> 00:35:21,999
at the bottom.

701
00:35:21,999 --> 00:35:24,209
And just like we showed on that little chart before,

702
00:35:24,209 --> 00:35:27,959
the communities come from many different places.

703
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:30,834
We tend to get good in those individual areas.

704
00:35:30,834 --> 00:35:32,999
But the people at the next level, the operational leaders, they are

705
00:35:32,999 --> 00:35:36,709
the ones that are able to integrate and pull these things together.

706
00:35:36,876 --> 00:35:40,999
In the cyber community we haven't done a good job of figuring that out.

707
00:35:40,999 --> 00:35:42,959
We tend to be very stovepipe.

708
00:35:42,999 --> 00:35:45,542
So a lot of the things we have been trying

709
00:35:45,542 --> 00:35:48,999
to do is encourage people who have expertise in one part

710
00:35:48,999 --> 00:35:52,209
of the cyberspace to cross over and do something else

711
00:35:52,209 --> 00:35:55,999
and learn about that other piece of it so they can help later

712
00:35:55,999 --> 00:35:58,375
with this integration.

713
00:35:58,792 --> 00:36:00,999
The strategic level, that's where we actually are trying

714
00:36:00,999 --> 00:36:03,167
to tie the thing back in.

715
00:36:03,167 --> 00:36:05,626
And you try to make it useful.

716
00:36:05,999 --> 00:36:08,792
And the other part that we're trying to do is we have a lot

717
00:36:08,792 --> 00:36:13,876
of strategic leaders today that know virtually nothing about cyberspace.

718
00:36:14,083 --> 00:36:16,125
They don't want to know in some cases.

719
00:36:16,667 --> 00:36:18,999
But it's incumbent on us to try to get them to understand

720
00:36:18,999 --> 00:36:21,250
the things that you know about cyberspace so that

721
00:36:21,250 --> 00:36:23,167
they can be better strategic leaders and

722
00:36:23,167 --> 00:36:25,999
they can better leverage cyberspace.

723
00:36:26,417 --> 00:36:30,083
So that's what I hope that I was able to talk to you about today.

724
00:36:30,083 --> 00:36:33,083
I think I left a few minutes for questions.

725
00:36:33,083 --> 00:36:34,918
I'm happy to take questions.

726
00:36:34,918 --> 00:36:38,250
I brought my pen with me because I'm happy to take ideas.

727
00:36:38,250 --> 00:36:40,375
Thanks so much for spending time with me.

728
00:36:40,375 --> 00:36:42,209
And I hope you have a great DEF CON.

729
00:36:48,125 --> 00:36:50,417
(applause)    Where are you going?

730
00:36:50,417 --> 00:36:51,999
You don't have any questions?

731
00:36:51,999 --> 00:36:53,083
You with the long hair.

732
00:36:53,083 --> 00:36:54,083
Come back here!

733
00:36:54,417 --> 00:36:56,667
Anyone have any questions?

734
00:37:03,918 --> 00:37:04,999
Come on.

735
00:37:04,999 --> 00:37:07,918
Needless to say they don't give us wireless mics here.

736
00:37:10,334 --> 00:37:11,542
(laughter).

737
00:37:11,542 --> 00:37:12,999
You really tantalized us with conversation

738
00:37:12,999 --> 00:37:15,375
about nuclear weapons and they are not connected

739
00:37:15,375 --> 00:37:18,667
to the Internet but connected via circuits.

740
00:37:19,083 --> 00:37:22,292
I know you probably can't give us details, but at least tell us you have got

741
00:37:22,292 --> 00:37:24,334
the best people on this.

742
00:37:24,334 --> 00:37:25,334
(laughter).

743
00:37:25,334 --> 00:37:26,334
LT.

744
00:37:26,334 --> 00:37:27,334
GEN.

745
00:37:27,334 --> 00:37:29,999
ROBERT ELDER: And it is all two man control, too.

746
00:37:30,334 --> 00:37:34,167
No, they're the Department of Defense and the Department

747
00:37:34,167 --> 00:37:37,834
of Energy both put their best people.

748
00:37:37,834 --> 00:37:40,876
It is kind of interesting, we talked about this two person thing, by the way,

749
00:37:40,876 --> 00:37:45,083
it even goes the Department of Defense does not own the weapons.

750
00:37:45,083 --> 00:37:46,792
The Department of Energy does.

751
00:37:46,792 --> 00:37:47,959
And it is done that way.

752
00:37:47,999 --> 00:37:51,083
Everything is split right down to the weapons itself.

753
00:37:51,083 --> 00:37:51,999
So the Department of Energy owns the weapons, not

754
00:37:51,999 --> 00:37:53,918
the Department of Defense.

755
00:37:53,918 --> 00:37:59,959
It is that kind of approach that they really try to lock themselves into.

756
00:37:59,999 --> 00:38:02,999
I tell you, though, it is kind of interesting, if you think

757
00:38:02,999 --> 00:38:07,667
about administrators on systems see, the banks do this, by the way.

758
00:38:07,959 --> 00:38:09,876
They set up their superadministrator accounts

759
00:38:09,876 --> 00:38:13,542
and it takes two people to be able to get into the log or do anything

760
00:38:13,542 --> 00:38:15,999
to affect it because they don't want anybody

761
00:38:15,999 --> 00:38:18,167
tampering with the logs.

762
00:38:18,709 --> 00:38:20,999
Again, it is a two person approach to things.

763
00:38:21,292 --> 00:38:24,250
The point is, there is a lot of things we can do that wouldn't

764
00:38:24,250 --> 00:38:26,999
necessarily cost a lot of money but we just haven't had

765
00:38:26,999 --> 00:38:30,999
the people think it through enough to figure out how to do it.

766
00:38:30,999 --> 00:38:33,083
We don't have the people with the expertise.

767
00:38:35,083 --> 00:38:39,083
Earlier you drew a comparison between TSA

768
00:38:39,083 --> 00:38:41,876
and cyber security.

769
00:38:41,876 --> 00:38:43,999
I was wondering, so if we don't have a TSA, we know

770
00:38:43,999 --> 00:38:46,167
the things that happen.

771
00:38:46,250 --> 00:38:47,999
People put bombs on planes.

772
00:38:47,999 --> 00:38:49,542
People turn planes into bombs.

773
00:38:49,999 --> 00:38:54,417
Can you imagine a cyber world without a dedicated cybersecurity force

774
00:38:54,417 --> 00:38:57,459
and what it would look like?

775
00:38:58,209 --> 00:39:00,167
Why do we need that in the way we need the TSA

776
00:39:00,167 --> 00:39:01,999
to protect airlines?

777
00:39:01,999 --> 00:39:03,250
LT.

778
00:39:03,999 --> 00:39:05,125
GEN.

779
00:39:05,125 --> 00:39:07,999
ROBERT ELDER: When the Internet was established what's

780
00:39:07,999 --> 00:39:10,751
funny about the Internet, when you go back

781
00:39:10,751 --> 00:39:13,125
to the initial ARPANET.

782
00:39:13,125 --> 00:39:15,542
I will give away some of my age.

783
00:39:15,626 --> 00:39:18,626
I got to use one of the initial ARPANET terminals.

784
00:39:19,209 --> 00:39:23,083
It was a research thing and trusted people working together,

785
00:39:23,083 --> 00:39:26,709
just like you would go to a bar and you would tell your

786
00:39:26,709 --> 00:39:28,999
buddies a story about something going

787
00:39:28,999 --> 00:39:32,459
on in your life and you trusted them.

788
00:39:32,709 --> 00:39:35,083
That's the whole origin of this thing.

789
00:39:35,083 --> 00:39:37,584
So now what's happened is after the fact, we're having

790
00:39:37,584 --> 00:39:41,167
to figure out a way to make sure that people don't use it

791
00:39:41,167 --> 00:39:43,959
against you, if you will.

792
00:39:43,959 --> 00:39:48,999
And so the cybersecurity is, basically, how people can still use cyberspace

793
00:39:48,999 --> 00:39:53,999
but have a way to feel like they're still protected.

794
00:39:53,999 --> 00:39:58,959
But the reality is, I think you need to have a dedicated cybersecurity force,

795
00:39:58,959 --> 00:40:01,918
but I also think up with of the mistakes we make

796
00:40:01,918 --> 00:40:04,751
is we let our users off the hook, particularly

797
00:40:04,751 --> 00:40:08,667
on these enterprise systems, and we don't hold them accountable

798
00:40:08,667 --> 00:40:10,792
for their actions.

799
00:40:10,792 --> 00:40:12,792
Because the best defense at the point of the spear

800
00:40:12,792 --> 00:40:15,959
is for that person, that operator that's on the system

801
00:40:15,959 --> 00:40:18,999
to say, that doesn't look right and then do something

802
00:40:18,999 --> 00:40:22,626
about it rather than wait until it gets so big that you do have

803
00:40:22,626 --> 00:40:27,292
to have the cybersecurity professional come in and deal with it.

804
00:40:27,292 --> 00:40:29,959
No, there's no way we can ever go back.

805
00:40:29,999 --> 00:40:33,292
The cybersecurity field is going to continue to grow.

806
00:40:33,417 --> 00:40:37,918
My argument here is there are some other ways it should

807
00:40:37,918 --> 00:40:42,709
grow beyond a purely security and into more proactive defense

808
00:40:42,709 --> 00:40:47,083
and this mission assurance type of approach.

809
00:40:47,459 --> 00:40:50,292
I'm sure everyone is happy to hear that Elvis Presley

810
00:40:50,292 --> 00:40:53,751
is in the house and has a question about cyber.

811
00:40:53,834 --> 00:40:56,999
(applause)    Thank you very much.

812
00:40:56,999 --> 00:40:58,000
Thank you very much.

813
00:41:00,834 --> 00:41:02,334
I'm Elvis.

814
00:41:02,334 --> 00:41:03,584
You may have heard of me.

815
00:41:03,584 --> 00:41:05,501
I'm kind of a big deal in this city.

816
00:41:05,584 --> 00:41:10,751
So one thing that has happened in history is, like, for Pearl Harbor,

817
00:41:10,751 --> 00:41:15,959
Pearl Harbor came out of nowhere and brought us in.

818
00:41:15,999 --> 00:41:18,876
Even 9/11, before 9/11 there were people already

819
00:41:18,876 --> 00:41:22,083
saying the things that needed to happen and no one wants

820
00:41:22,083 --> 00:41:25,250
to spend money until after the crisis.

821
00:41:25,250 --> 00:41:29,459
We even saw it for Y2K and you were probably

822
00:41:29,459 --> 00:41:32,459
like 50 then or so.

823
00:41:32,999 --> 00:41:36,083
Even for Y2K (laughter) there were people saying there's problems

824
00:41:36,083 --> 00:41:39,918
in code and when it rolls over there could be a problem.

825
00:41:39,918 --> 00:41:41,999
There were people that told Congress this.

826
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:44,209
We always waited until the last minute.

827
00:41:45,501 --> 00:41:47,999
For cyber, we're doing the same thing.

828
00:41:47,999 --> 00:41:49,501
We're saying the same stuff.

829
00:41:49,834 --> 00:41:51,125
And I'm glad that you're here and you are giving a lot

830
00:41:51,125 --> 00:41:54,125
of good information and you are soliciting information.

831
00:41:54,125 --> 00:41:56,083
I think it's great to partner like that.

832
00:41:56,375 --> 00:41:59,209
But what's being done to actually get the wheels

833
00:41:59,209 --> 00:42:01,417
to actually turn?

834
00:42:01,417 --> 00:42:02,999
Are we going to have to have like a cyber Pearl Harbor

835
00:42:02,999 --> 00:42:06,501
before anybody really wants to put money into this?

836
00:42:06,792 --> 00:42:08,083
Because everything will cost money no matter how smart

837
00:42:08,083 --> 00:42:09,417
we are.

838
00:42:09,417 --> 00:42:10,417
LT.

839
00:42:10,417 --> 00:42:11,417
GEN.

840
00:42:11,417 --> 00:42:13,459
ROBERT ELDER: That's a great question.

841
00:42:13,459 --> 00:42:14,459
(applause).

842
00:42:14,709 --> 00:42:17,918
So, first, Elvis, the bad news is history has a tendency

843
00:42:17,918 --> 00:42:19,834
to repeat itself.

844
00:42:19,834 --> 00:42:22,999
So before we really see them putting the money into this that they need to,

845
00:42:22,999 --> 00:42:27,167
there will probably end up having to be a cyber Pearl Harbor.

846
00:42:27,167 --> 00:42:28,209
That's the bad news.

847
00:42:28,209 --> 00:42:32,999
The good news is that in a lot of the sectors, business people

848
00:42:32,999 --> 00:42:38,501
like to make money but they are also risk adverse.

849
00:42:38,584 --> 00:42:41,542
So they actually bring in risk management principles

850
00:42:41,542 --> 00:42:45,083
into the way that they do these things.

851
00:42:45,083 --> 00:42:47,542
So a lot of these companies are now starting

852
00:42:47,542 --> 00:42:54,083
to invest the money that they need to, particularly the larger companies.

853
00:42:54,083 --> 00:42:56,584
I will tell you the defense contractors, they now with what

854
00:42:56,584 --> 00:42:58,709
they now know about what the threats are,

855
00:42:58,709 --> 00:43:01,751
they are definitely putting money into these type of things

856
00:43:01,751 --> 00:43:04,125
because they are fully aware.

857
00:43:04,417 --> 00:43:06,292
The banks understand it.

858
00:43:06,292 --> 00:43:08,709
Some of the other communities have done that.

859
00:43:08,709 --> 00:43:12,125
So the communities that recognize that their ability to continue to operate

860
00:43:12,125 --> 00:43:16,167
the way that allows them to make money or do their business,

861
00:43:16,167 --> 00:43:21,250
they are now starting to put money in those kinds of places.

862
00:43:21,334 --> 00:43:26,167
But we're still, like, maybe 10% of all the sectors in the United States.

863
00:43:26,167 --> 00:43:28,167
And everybody else just assumes that the government is going

864
00:43:28,167 --> 00:43:30,375
to protect them from this.

865
00:43:30,375 --> 00:43:34,834
And this is not something I mean, cyber com is not going to protect

866
00:43:34,834 --> 00:43:39,209
the small business owner from a cyber attack.

867
00:43:39,501 --> 00:43:41,999
Once they figure that out I told people it

868
00:43:41,999 --> 00:43:45,083
is like the 12 steps for an alcoholic.

869
00:43:45,083 --> 00:43:47,667
First step is you have to admit you have a problem.

870
00:43:47,751 --> 00:43:49,876
The thing that scared me when we did a workshop,

871
00:43:49,876 --> 00:43:51,999
I had these experts in there.

872
00:43:52,167 --> 00:43:55,209
Even with the experts, they kept trying to go back and say,

873
00:43:55,209 --> 00:44:00,083
well, clearly we'll figure out a way to keep this from happening.

874
00:44:00,083 --> 00:44:03,125
And it's very difficult to get people into that mind set.

875
00:44:03,125 --> 00:44:05,876
It is one of the things that you guys

876
00:44:05,876 --> 00:44:08,999
through these conferences do, is you highlight

877
00:44:08,999 --> 00:44:13,999
to people that there are these vulnerabilities and hopefully repetition,

878
00:44:13,999 --> 00:44:16,083
they'll hear it.

879
00:44:16,083 --> 00:44:17,709
I applaud you to do that.

880
00:44:17,709 --> 00:44:18,876
And I encourage you to do that because that's the only way we

881
00:44:18,876 --> 00:44:20,834
will get the message across.

882
00:44:22,417 --> 00:44:24,667
Three questions.

883
00:44:24,667 --> 00:44:25,959
One question.

884
00:44:25,999 --> 00:44:29,125
There is two other people and we got to get out of here.

885
00:44:29,125 --> 00:44:29,459
I will say all three at once so you get to answer

886
00:44:29,459 --> 00:44:30,999
all of them at once.

887
00:44:30,999 --> 00:44:31,999
I like it.

888
00:44:31,999 --> 00:44:34,209
You are manipulating the system.

889
00:44:34,209 --> 00:44:35,459
That is inappropriate.

890
00:44:36,167 --> 00:44:37,292
(laughter).

891
00:44:37,999 --> 00:44:42,417
One of the things that we've seen DARPA do is they have engaged

892
00:44:42,417 --> 00:44:46,375
the community through the cyber fast track.

893
00:44:46,626 --> 00:44:50,999
Apparently cyber fast track has turned off.

894
00:44:50,999 --> 00:44:53,501
Will DHS pick this up or will the money go

895
00:44:53,501 --> 00:44:57,626
to the big contractors or slow innovation or will we see

896
00:44:57,626 --> 00:45:01,083
the same kind of initiative engage this community

897
00:45:01,083 --> 00:45:05,999
to develop those unique ideas, those unique defenses?

ROBERT ELDER: I thought DARPA still had money in the cyber fast track.

901
00:45:14,125 --> 00:45:15,375
Defunded.

GEN.

904
00:45:17,667 --> 00:45:19,792
ROBERT ELDER: That's typical for DARPA.

905
00:45:19,792 --> 00:45:20,709
DARPA is supposed to get things started and have other

906
00:45:20,709 --> 00:45:22,834
people pick it up.

907
00:45:22,834 --> 00:45:28,667
What I can tell you is that DHS does have some programs.

908
00:45:28,999 --> 00:45:32,999
In fact, the stuff that I do at the Cyber Innovation Center which

909
00:45:32,999 --> 00:45:36,709
is pro bono work for me is work that's actually funded

910
00:45:36,709 --> 00:45:40,918
by the National Science Foundation and by DHS.

911
00:45:41,209 --> 00:45:45,334
If you go around the country, there are a number of are they tend

912
00:45:45,334 --> 00:45:49,667
to be non profits that have stood up all around the country that are

913
00:45:49,667 --> 00:45:52,584
starting to take this thing on.

914
00:45:52,584 --> 00:45:55,501
So it's becoming somewhat of a grassroots effort.

915
00:45:55,751 --> 00:45:57,751
And I'm actually encouraged by that.

916
00:45:57,751 --> 00:45:59,501
There is a lot of interest to do that.

917
00:46:01,125 --> 00:46:03,542
It is not going to have the kind of funding that DARPA was able

918
00:46:03,542 --> 00:46:06,125
to put into it, though, that's the challenge.

919
00:46:06,125 --> 00:46:08,918
The other thing that's being defunded is the DIB.

920
00:46:08,918 --> 00:46:11,626
You have mentioned the DIB during this whole process.

921
00:46:11,626 --> 00:46:13,834
Who is going to take that initiative?

922
00:46:13,834 --> 00:46:14,834
LT.

923

924
00:46:15,834 --> 00:46:16,999
ROBERT ELDER: So the DIB pilot went

925
00:46:16,999 --> 00:46:21,459
out but the information sharing continues.

926
00:46:23,834 --> 00:46:25,918
They do have the information sharing piece

927
00:46:25,918 --> 00:46:28,918
but they are using the ISAC to do it now.

928
00:46:29,501 --> 00:46:34,999
To what degree do you think from an information assurance

929
00:46:34,999 --> 00:46:41,584
standpoint you can start selecting the guy that wrote black swan would

930
00:46:41,584 --> 00:46:44,667
called anti fragility.

931
00:46:46,999 --> 00:46:50,501
We are in an environment of a few large targets,

932
00:46:50,501 --> 00:46:54,999
large target sessions, crack exploit everywhere.

933
00:46:55,125 --> 00:46:59,167
Where what we need to do is start going towards a diversity

934
00:46:59,167 --> 00:47:02,751
of smaller, more robust targets.

935
00:47:02,751 --> 00:47:05,459
Are how are we going to get that changed

936
00:47:05,459 --> 00:47:09,667
around since the business imperative seems to be

937
00:47:09,667 --> 00:47:14,167
toward conglomeration and single source support, much

938
00:47:14,167 --> 00:47:19,209
the standardization much the way the DOD does.

939

00:47:21,209 --> 00:47:23,083
ROBERT ELDER: You are exactly right.

942
00:47:23,083 --> 00:47:23,083
It is a huge problem because particularly

943
00:47:23,083 --> 00:47:26,417
in the business community, they're looking for efficiencies.

944
00:47:27,083 --> 00:47:29,250
Sequestration in particular, everybody is looking for efficiency

945
00:47:29,250 --> 00:47:30,999
in government as well.

946
00:47:31,292 --> 00:47:34,667
Where I see some encouragement, by the way, for your question

947
00:47:34,667 --> 00:47:36,959
is actually in the business community and

948
00:47:36,959 --> 00:47:41,083
the process that they're using is a risk management process.

949
00:47:41,083 --> 00:47:42,999
They apply it across their business.

950
00:47:42,999 --> 00:47:45,918
They are now starting to apply to their cyber systems.

951
00:47:46,083 --> 00:47:48,542
What I'm worried about is they're now starting

952
00:47:48,542 --> 00:47:51,083
to do some things like in the industrial sectors

953
00:47:51,083 --> 00:47:54,584
with the industrial controls, things like energy, transportation,

954
00:47:54,584 --> 00:47:57,542
they're now starting to look at this.

955
00:47:57,542 --> 00:47:59,083
But it turns out they are looking at it and they say, you know,

956
00:47:59,083 --> 00:48:02,083
we design it had to be this very efficient system.

957
00:48:02,083 --> 00:48:05,375
It is difficult to go back in and reengineer it to be the other way.

958
00:48:05,375 --> 00:48:06,999
They are starting to do it now.

959
00:48:07,167 --> 00:48:09,083
The only way to keep this thing going we have

960
00:48:09,083 --> 00:48:12,167
to keep telling the business owners, we have to keep telling

961
00:48:12,167 --> 00:48:15,167
the Congress that it's important to not put all your eggs

962
00:48:15,167 --> 00:48:19,083
in one basket and demonstrate to them what could happen.

963
00:48:19,501 --> 00:48:23,751
Sir, you did a lot of talking about the processes and

964
00:48:23,751 --> 00:48:26,709
the high level strategies.

965
00:48:26,959 --> 00:48:29,167
One of the things I've seen over and over again

966
00:48:29,167 --> 00:48:34,125
in government organizations that I work with is that this is about the people.

967
00:48:35,083 --> 00:48:38,209
The government has gone to a point where it

968
00:48:38,209 --> 00:48:42,501
is about the certifications you have, DOD8570 and so forth

969
00:48:42,501 --> 00:48:47,209
to where we have lined a lot of pockets of certification companies

970
00:48:47,209 --> 00:48:51,999
in an effort to prove that people know these skills.

971
00:48:52,083 --> 00:48:54,083
But on the outside, in the commercial sector,

972
00:48:54,083 --> 00:48:56,999
that doesn't seem to be the case.

973
00:48:56,999 --> 00:49:00,918
They don't have as much desire to have people with certifications

974
00:49:00,918 --> 00:49:04,542
to be able to prove they can do the job.

975
00:49:04,542 --> 00:49:06,375
If they can't do the job, they move on.

976
00:49:06,751 --> 00:49:09,334
And they have a hierarchy set up to allow people to grow

977
00:49:09,334 --> 00:49:11,959
within their organization.

978
00:49:11,959 --> 00:49:15,709
And most government contracting companies that I have seen and

979
00:49:15,709 --> 00:49:19,667
the government military and civilian markets as well,

980
00:49:19,667 --> 00:49:24,667
they want people to get a large breadth of knowledge.

981
00:49:25,542 --> 00:49:27,999
Is there any thought about maybe changing that paradigm

982
00:49:27,999 --> 00:49:30,167
to where we get specialists?

983
00:49:30,209 --> 00:49:32,751
Where we let people focus in on the technical aspects

984
00:49:32,751 --> 00:49:35,584
on the things they like to do, that they're good at,

985
00:49:35,584 --> 00:49:38,083
and let them stay there without penalizing them

986
00:49:38,083 --> 00:49:41,999
in the system and maybe getting away from making it so hard to get rid

987
00:49:41,999 --> 00:49:45,501
of people and encouraging growth from within.

988
00:49:45,501 --> 00:49:46,501
LT.

989
00:49:46,501 --> 00:49:47,501
GEN.

990
00:49:47,501 --> 00:49:48,667
ROBERT ELDER: Yeah, so to be perfectly honest,

991
00:49:48,667 --> 00:49:51,584
I still have friends in government that work

992
00:49:51,584 --> 00:49:55,709
on the personnel sides of things and they are actually looking

993
00:49:55,709 --> 00:49:59,999
at the exact type of thing you are talking about.

994
00:49:59,999 --> 00:50:03,167
A lot of the standardization piece, it is funny, they were trying

995
00:50:03,167 --> 00:50:05,999
to mimic what they saw on the outside and they said,

996
00:50:05,999 --> 00:50:08,999
we should try to do something like that.

997
00:50:08,999 --> 00:50:11,083
Of course, whenever the government does something,

998
00:50:11,083 --> 00:50:14,501
it turns into its very bureaucratic and you lose sight

999
00:50:14,501 --> 00:50:16,999
of the actual objective and you get locked

1000
00:50:16,999 --> 00:50:20,999
into all the processes bureaucratic processes.

1001
00:50:21,250 --> 00:50:26,292
But there is a huge effort, number one, to grow a cyber workforce, especially

1002
00:50:26,292 --> 00:50:30,834
in the Department of Defense and the other government agencies

1003
00:50:30,834 --> 00:50:35,501
and they are looking to find ways to make it attractive for people

1004
00:50:35,501 --> 00:50:37,250
to do that.

1005
00:50:37,250 --> 00:50:38,250
So the types of things you are talking about are

1006
00:50:38,250 --> 00:50:40,083
all being considered.

1007
00:50:40,999 --> 00:50:43,000
So one of the things, by the way I'm not

1008
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:48,250
in that business myself but I have a lot of friends that still work with that.

1009
00:50:48,417 --> 00:50:51,709
And so I will give you my card because I'm looking

1010
00:50:51,709 --> 00:50:56,000
to get those ideas and I will pass it to them.

1011
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:59,042
So let me make sure I give you a card before you run out of here.

1012
00:51:01,501 --> 00:51:04,250
Thank you very much.

1013
00:51:07,125 --> 00:51:09,667
(applause)    All right.

1014
00:51:12,584 --> 00:51:15,999
We need to close the stage for the next speakers but we

1015
00:51:15,999 --> 00:51:19,876
will take the General over to the Chillout Cafe.

1016
00:51:19,876 --> 00:51:22,999
So he will do some Q&A there before he heads out to the airport.

1017
00:51:22,999 --> 00:51:23,999
All right.

1018
00:51:23,999 --> 00:51:24,999
Thank you very much.
