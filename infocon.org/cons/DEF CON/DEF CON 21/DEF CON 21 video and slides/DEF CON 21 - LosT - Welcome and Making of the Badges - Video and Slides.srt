1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:05,850
 LosT: So, welcome, DEF CON 21. Last year
was DEF CON 20, this is 21. Welcome.

2
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:12,850
(Laughter.)
 LosT: We thought about calling it DEF CON

3
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:20,109
20++. So last year, surrounding the badges,
there is always this a little bit of panic

4
00:00:20,109 --> 00:00:27,109
here. Some of you guys aren't getting any
audio, are you? So this is me saying basically

5
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:32,619
this is my empty lanyard. This was Wednesday
afternoon last year right before the conference

6
00:00:32,619 --> 00:00:38,510
and me holding up the lanyards and saying,
yeah, where's my badges? Where are they? That's

7
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:43,399
the kind of stress and panic that usually
surrounds the creation process of the DEF

8
00:00:43,399 --> 00:00:48,170
CON badges. We try and keep pretty tight security
because every year we have people that try

9
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:53,159
and figure out where we're going to fabricate.
We've had people contact the PCP fab houses

10
00:00:53,159 --> 00:00:57,659
we used before and social engineered them
into making a set of badges for themselves

11
00:00:57,659 --> 00:01:02,319
preCON.
We have had people contact the PCP houses

12
00:01:02,319 --> 00:01:09,319
post‑CON and get uber badges fabricated.
It has been quite an adventure trying to maintain

13
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:13,909
security just around the badges themselves
and with a security conference, it is kind

14
00:01:13,909 --> 00:01:19,829
of ‑‑ it is not really malicious per se.
It is more of a trophy a demonstration of

15
00:01:19,829 --> 00:01:25,890
skill. But, you know, it's fun stuff.
So this year, I've had quite a few discussions

16
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,950
with Jeff, Dark Tangent. For those of you
not familiar with some of the traditions and

17
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:32,929
things surrounding DEF CON ‑‑ how many
of you have been to DEF CON for more than

18
00:01:32,929 --> 00:01:39,929
five years? So the n00bs outnumber the seasoned
vets here by quite a number based on the hands

19
00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:46,740
that you guys have been raising.
So one of the things that you'll notice with

20
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:52,920
the DEF CON iconography is we have traditionally
had ‑‑ we've traditionally had a series

21
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:57,509
of three, what I call, PIPs associated with
us which are the rotary dial. Those of you

22
00:01:57,509 --> 00:02:00,630
in high school, you know what that is, right?
(laughter).

23
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:07,569
 LosT: Yeah. So if you see the Goon badges,
the rotary dial is actually a brass knuckle.

24
00:02:07,569 --> 00:02:14,569
(Feedback).
 LosT: Hello. So the rotary ‑‑ are

25
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:18,480
you getting this? Sounds like when I talk,
it cuts out.

26
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:22,879
The rotary dial was part of our culture because
back in the day when we didn't have Internets

27
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:29,090
we were all using BCBs and phone lines. A
kid on a Commodore 64 with a modem, the only

28
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:36,090
way you could connect is dial‑up. It suddenly
became valuable to get these sprint and MCI

29
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:42,430
codes to reach out and touch your friends
on Fito net and all these BCBs. It became

30
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:49,430
a big part of hacker culture to be able to
get free long distance.

31
00:02:49,849 --> 00:02:55,519
The smiley face with the skull and cross‑bones
has become ubiquitous with DEF CON as well.

32
00:02:55,519 --> 00:03:01,610
It ties into the piracy aspect. And the floppy
disk, again, all you high school guys out

33
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:08,610
there know what that is. It's later cousin,
the click, click, click, click, disk, I mean

34
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:14,540
zip disk. You guys all remember those, right?
How many of those have a pile somewhere in

35
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:21,010
a back closet? Yeah. (laughter).
 LosT: Anybody still using one? Yeah.

36
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:26,420
(laughter).
 LosT: I'm sorry. So I talked ‑‑ I

37
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:29,900
was talking to Jeff and I said, you know,
we've got these symbols that are on our lanyards,

38
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:35,780
they are on our programs and half of them
haven't really kept up with the times. It

39
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:42,650
is more just a tradition. We need a fourth.
We need to round out the trifecta here. So

40
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:47,750
I asked Jeff's permission to introduce a new
symbol that will become part of the DEF CON

41
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:52,890
iconography.
And I did this pre all of the Snowden garbage

42
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:58,329
that's going on right now which is really
scary that it happened on the timing. And

43
00:03:58,329 --> 00:04:03,019
so I have introduced the key hole. Now, when
I went to Jeff with the key hole, I said I

44
00:04:03,019 --> 00:04:07,790
think it is timeless and it fits in several
different aspects of our hacker culture. I

45
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:12,459
said, first of all, we've got physical security.
We do the lock picking stuff, the lock is

46
00:04:12,459 --> 00:04:19,459
indicative of that. Locks and keys and key
holes are also usually represented to represent

47
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:23,760
cryptography so I think we have the crypto
aspect.

48
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:29,950
And I said, they're also surreptitious observation
all lot of times, peeking through the key

49
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:35,070
hole, listening through the key holes. A lot
of history novels will have a magnifying glass

50
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:40,880
and the key hole up there or you will see
the eyeball peeking through. I thought it

51
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:46,010
was appropriate to introduce. And so from
this point forward, when we do all of our

52
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:51,980
designs and everything else, instead of the
three circle symbols, we will have the fourth.

53
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:57,410
You guys are really quiet.
 Whew! (applause).

54
00:04:57,410 --> 00:05:04,410
 (speaker off microphone.)
 LosT: So, another tradition that I'm going

55
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:11,760
to break ‑‑ oh, and side tangent. I kind
of pictured this year as you know those magicians'

56
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:16,550
famous secrets reveal where the dude wore
the stupid hockey mask and told how the magic

57
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:22,110
tricks were done on a cable show and he did
that so that the same magicians couldn't keep

58
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:26,380
reusing the same crap over and over again.
This year with the breaking of traditions

59
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:31,490
was kind of my foray into I have been doing
this stuff for many, many years for DEF CON

60
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:38,320
now but my personal challenge is to try and
vest myself every year with badge design crypto,

61
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:42,060
the game design and all the things that I
touch. And one of the ways I'm motivating

62
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:48,950
myself to do some really good things moving
forward is to do this is kind of my DEF CON's

63
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:53,910
greatest secrets revealed so I can't keep
pulling the same old stuff out and keep retreading

64
00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:58,410
because I think it is a copout.
So one of the things we also never do every

65
00:05:58,410 --> 00:06:03,350
year is we always hold the uber badge and
information regarding the uber badge back

66
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:07,030
until the last day of the conference on Sunday
when they're awarded. How many of you have

67
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:12,770
no concept what the uber badge is at DEF CON?
So when you attend DEF CON, you get badges

68
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:17,780
that basically say I paid for the conference.
They say what level you are. And you will

69
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:22,590
hear us say human and inhuman that's because
the general attend dance or general populous

70
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:29,590
are referred to as humans. Everyone else is
inhumans. That would be vendors, the press,

71
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:33,950
the speakers. I'm getting there with the press,
just wait.

72
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:36,730
(laughter).
 LosT: And so you have the human and inhuman.

73
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:40,710
But you also have a very special badge every
year that is known as the uber badge.

74
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:46,660
Now, we like DEF CON to be very interactive
conference. It is a put up or shut up place.

75
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:53,660
It is like everybody talks a big game. Everybody
has hacked with Gibson. Everybody has trained

76
00:06:54,250 --> 00:07:01,250
with Bruce Lee. We have more contests than
any contest. We have between 40 and 80 contests

77
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:10,570
running. Some of them are incredibly difficult
and challenging. Some are just for fun. You

78
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:14,710
will see them going on as you go. You may
have noticed some of the crypto that's involved

79
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:20,710
on the graphics on the floor and out in the
program and in your lanyards. So if you come

80
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:25,920
to DEF CON and you compete in what we call
a black badge competition which means a competition

81
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:32,770
that warrants enough effort and skill, you
are awarded a black uber badge and that's

82
00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:37,020
free entrance into DEF CON for the rest of
your life.

83
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:41,690
To give you an idea how rare they are, last
year we had roughly 15,000 people attend and

84
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:47,390
we gave out about 15 uber badges. It is a
very elite club to have a black uber badge.

85
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:53,330
It is more bragging rights in the community
than anything. It is kind of a token of appreciation

86
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:59,740
for people who share or demonstrate skill.
But the uber badge, because it is awarded

87
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:04,060
at the end of the conference usually you don't
get to see them or know anything about them

88
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:09,270
until Sunday at the closing ceremonies. You
will see people who have uber badges will

89
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:13,670
often wear them from that point forward. So
you will see some folks that have badges that

90
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:18,220
look like they don't match within the theme
of the year. That's probably an uber badge

91
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:24,150
from previous years.
Excuse me. I'm going to grab some water.

92
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:29,120
So breaking with another tradition, they say,
hey, Jeff, I want to show the uber badge on

93
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:36,120
Thursday. He's like, man, what are you doing
to me, Ryan? He's like you're adding key holes.

94
00:08:36,939 --> 00:08:40,849
You are going to show the uber badge. You
did not dye your hair. You are not wearing

95
00:08:40,849 --> 00:08:47,849
a hat. The world is changing, I guess. (laughter).
So, if you have noticed on your map, there

96
00:08:50,389 --> 00:08:55,350
is a room listed at 1057, that is the room
I will be in and I will have uber badges on

97
00:08:55,350 --> 00:09:02,029
display for people to handle and look at.
And we'll get more into what they are later

98
00:09:02,029 --> 00:09:07,180
on.
Before I move forward in that ‑‑ I'm

99
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:14,180
getting feedback here. So the last thing that
I asked Jeff ‑‑ and this is a doozy and

100
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:18,970
I just thought, man, there is no way in hell
he will go for this. Those of you coming here

101
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:23,899
expecting an electronic badge this year, this
is kind of my it is electronic but not electronic.

102
00:09:23,899 --> 00:09:30,290
I wanted to do a tick tock cycle on badge
design where I do a year electronic a year

103
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:34,850
non‑electronic. So this one is kind of faux
electronic in some ways. It is a PCB.

104
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:40,449
But the reason I want to do that is it becomes
passe. You go to conferences and everybody

105
00:09:40,449 --> 00:09:47,449
has an electronic badge. We had the blinking
LEDs and last year we had a processor with

106
00:09:48,459 --> 00:09:55,459
eight 32‑bit cores on a dye with a propellor
chip. I don't want it to get people come expecting

107
00:09:55,699 --> 00:10:00,410
an electronic badge because for my competitions
if you know what to expect, it gives you an

108
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:05,720
unfair advantage to those who are new.
And ironically the year I did the titanium

109
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:12,709
badges that were non‑electronic I had far
greater participation by the attendees in

110
00:10:12,709 --> 00:10:17,180
the competition than I did last year with
the electronic badges. And I asked people

111
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:22,850
that and it appears as though people just
don't want to mess with the electronics at

112
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:27,749
the conference. It is a very small subset,
about 10%, because if you are not familiar

113
00:10:27,749 --> 00:10:33,050
with an architecture or the language or the
tool chain for a new chip, you don't want

114
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:37,839
to come to DEF CON and use up your three days
here, you know, sitting at a laptop trying

115
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:41,850
to figure that out.
So I went to Jeff and I said, you know, one

116
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:48,490
of the really iconic parts of DEF CON is the
badge. And we keep it secret every single

117
00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:53,610
year until the conference starts. And I go,
I want to tell them about DEF CON 22's badge

118
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:59,370
at DEF CON 21 so that they have a year to
prepare.

119
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:03,680
And he didn't get back to me for a while.
He said he had to think about it. And he said,

120
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:08,199
you know what? Let's give them partial information.
Let's give them a little bit information because

121
00:11:08,199 --> 00:11:13,889
next year's badge will be an electronic badge.
The games will be every bit as intense as

122
00:11:13,889 --> 00:11:18,069
they are this year and as they were last year
and the year before. But we want to people

123
00:11:18,069 --> 00:11:23,350
to be able to get exposure to the tool chain
and the chip and the architecture.

124
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:29,490
So we're also going to release a monthly blog
that's kind of a mini how‑to on how to develop

125
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:34,120
or program for those of you who are just straight
coders for what the badge will be next year.

126
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:37,579
We won't give you the details and specs on
what it does.

127
00:11:37,579 --> 00:11:42,850
I had prepared to announce what an architecture
was today. However, I was told ‑‑ and

128
00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:47,189
it was actually pretty exciting because it
is a processor that is not yet released, and

129
00:11:47,189 --> 00:11:52,089
I was going to be able to say, hey, we are
one of the first groups to get our hands on

130
00:11:52,089 --> 00:11:55,559
this new architecture.
I have just been told that based on their

131
00:11:55,559 --> 00:12:00,259
last engineering run, they're not quite sure
they will be able to deliver chips to me in

132
00:12:00,259 --> 00:12:06,199
time to get next year's badge produced. That
being said, I've got to wait to tell you what

133
00:12:06,199 --> 00:12:10,740
that architecture is because if they can't
get me that architecture before next year,

134
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:14,790
then obviously I can't do it.
 (speaker off microphone.)

135
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:21,790
 I can neither nor deny that.
And I have set a deadline that by December

136
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:29,509
this year if that information hasn't been ‑‑
if they haven't told me that they can source

137
00:12:29,509 --> 00:12:34,059
that chip for me by December, then I'm just
going to pick a different architecture. I

138
00:12:34,059 --> 00:12:39,139
can tell you that my fall‑back architecture
will most likely be a MSP430 or something

139
00:12:39,139 --> 00:12:45,029
in that series from TI.
So anyway, secret information. See, it is

140
00:12:45,029 --> 00:12:50,600
kind of like my doc dump. You guys have hacked
into my system and getting all my secrets

141
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:55,779
and all my information. I will have to go
back and rethink my security cycle, I guess.

142
00:12:55,779 --> 00:13:00,379
So here on the screen you'll see some of the
CAD work that was done for the uber badge

143
00:13:00,379 --> 00:13:04,910
this year. And I normally use Altium for my
design stuff if you are familiar with the

144
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:11,050
tool chain. I wanted to use software that
was able to be accessible or free to everyone.

145
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:16,059
So all of the badges were designed on the
free version of Eagle. Those of you who do

146
00:13:16,059 --> 00:13:21,949
design work, that means, Simon, you are nuts,
over and over again. (laughter).

147
00:13:21,949 --> 00:13:28,949
It wasn't fun and I found some really cool
errors in Eagle. There is an error that comes

148
00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:37,050
up too many pixels in the Y direction. What
the hell does that mean? That's like PC Load

149
00:13:37,529 --> 00:13:44,529
Letter. (laughter).
Being a hacker ‑‑ also, it was German.

150
00:13:46,339 --> 00:13:50,860
Being a hacker, I took obviously my work and
I rotated it because I wanted to see if there

151
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:56,699
are too many pixels in the opposite direction.
There's not. (laughter).

152
00:13:56,699 --> 00:14:01,129
I still don't know why I got that error because
I couldn't reproduce it just by ‑‑ because

153
00:14:01,129 --> 00:14:07,680
then, of course, you start reducing a bit
at a time to find out where that extreme is,

154
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:12,379
right?
So this year's badge, the uber badge specifically

155
00:14:12,379 --> 00:14:19,379
is a homage to my grandfather. He was a watchmaker.
He said when he was in watch making school,

156
00:14:19,629 --> 00:14:26,490
they would hand them raw metal and they had
to make a watch. That included the springs,

157
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:33,490
the case, everything. Since this is something
I just started doing since last DEF CON, I

158
00:14:35,009 --> 00:14:41,610
didn't have that level of skill or the equipment
to do that. So I ordered some of the parts

159
00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:46,220
preassembled but then assembled those parts.
For those of you familiar with watch making,

160
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:52,869
I couldn't possibly do the hair spring to
the balance wheel myself so those came assembled.

161
00:14:52,869 --> 00:14:57,160
If you look at the graphic that's on the bottom
there, most mechanical watch movements only

162
00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:03,720
have five main components. And I had this
whole cool spiel prepared to show how we could

163
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:10,720
map security and hacking in using the watch
to move that forward but then I decided I

164
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:15,119
can't share that with you yet because it will
ruin some of the badge challenge that is happening

165
00:15:15,119 --> 00:15:18,749
this year.
If you go across the bottom, you have basically

166
00:15:18,749 --> 00:15:25,749
a mainstream and the balance wheel and the
escape that controls how the energy is released.

167
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:33,089
That's kind of like your firewall. And then
at the end, the 5 and the 6 are displayed

168
00:15:33,089 --> 00:15:40,089
to show you the time.
So all of the glass that's on the uber badge,

169
00:15:40,559 --> 00:15:45,670
they are actual watch crystals on the front
and the back. Can you hear this?

170
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:47,709
(Ticking).
 Yes!

171
00:15:47,709 --> 00:15:54,709
 LosT: So it is really hard to sleep when
you have 30 of these ticking in your room.

172
00:15:55,459 --> 00:15:58,369
(laughter).
And I'm getting to the point now where I just

173
00:15:58,369 --> 00:16:01,740
started blocking the noise out because I have
been working on these for so many months.

174
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:08,740
It is just ticking all the time.
There's some of the movement out with the

175
00:16:09,179 --> 00:16:14,889
PCB on top on one of my desks.
(Clapping).

176
00:16:14,889 --> 00:16:21,399
 LosT: Thank you. Somebody clapped.
(applause).

177
00:16:21,399 --> 00:16:28,399
Yeah, they were just a little bit of work.
So all of them were hand assembled by myself

178
00:16:31,610 --> 00:16:35,860
for the ubers. And that's why I can only do
the ubers like this because there's no way

179
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:41,709
I could possibly get 15,000 badges done for
all you guys. Sorry.

180
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:47,389
There's a few more pictures and I will leave
that one up there for a minute in case anybody

181
00:16:47,389 --> 00:16:50,259
is participating in the badge challenge because
I thought you might want to get a picture

182
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:57,259
of the code that's on the back there. Geez,
you guys are quiet. This is DEF CON. You know,

183
00:16:59,819 --> 00:17:03,869
the people that are new here, you are supposed
to make noise and yell at me and throw things.

184
00:17:03,869 --> 00:17:08,080
 Yeah!
 LosT: This is not black hat.

185
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:12,240
(laughter).
 LosT: I mean, this is not an infomercial

186
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:19,240
or a trade show.
 (speaker off microphone.)

187
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:26,800
 LosT: What's that?
 (speaker off microphone.)

188
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:36,760
 LosT: Are you done? No? Yes? Ten seconds.
 Marco.

189
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:47,460
 Polo! (laughter).
 LosT: By the way, the copper that's underneath

190
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:53,470
the solder mass doesn't quite show up in the
picture, just FYI. Some of you may have noticed

191
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:58,440
that on your own badges. There's some ‑‑
well, we'll get to that in a minute. So one

192
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:02,770
of the other things we did this year, more
variations on the badge than ever. So up until

193
00:18:02,770 --> 00:18:08,120
the time I started doing the badge design,
we always did: Here's your human badge. Here's

194
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:13,660
your press badge. Here's your speaker badge.
And there was only one human badge. So I started

195
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:19,310
because I'm a masochist doing multiple human
designs to give you guys some variety and

196
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:26,310
flavor and it gave me more of a design palette
for the crypto challenges.

197
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:31,740
I won't tell you how many because that's part
of the game is for you to figure that out.

198
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:38,740
There are more human variations than we have
ever had. In addition to that ‑‑ there

199
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:44,960
is us doing some of the sorting of the badges
to make sure when we distribute them, there

200
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:50,670
was a mixture. Because there was one year,
last year actually, the registration desks

201
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:55,130
were taking the boxes as they came in. And,
of course, even those there were multiple

202
00:18:55,130 --> 00:18:59,480
designs they came grouped together so all
of a particular badge were going out like

203
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:03,940
on Thursday and all on Friday and it prevented
people from moving forward in the game because

204
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:10,540
they couldn't find the other variants. So
we actually hand mixed up all the badges this

205
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:15,720
year.
(applause)

206
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:22,720
 LosT: So, like I mentioned before, we have
these things we call non‑human badges. You

207
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:32,890
will notice that all of the non‑human badges
this year are, in fact, face cards with the

208
00:19:32,890 --> 00:19:39,890
exception of one. That would be the press
badge. The press badge is a deus.

209
00:19:40,810 --> 00:19:47,810
(applause).
 LosT: And for the slow kids in the audience,

210
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:55,450
that is my "fuck you" to the press. (laughter).
 LosT: Oh, deuce. I get it. It is spelled

211
00:19:57,580 --> 00:20:04,580
differently. The one on your left is the vendor
badge. That's why he has the bit coin. The

212
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:10,590
one in the middle you got to kind of figure
it out. But the base behind him is a GNL base.

213
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:17,300
So that's a little bit of a hint.
So I added two new card types because, no

214
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:23,120
poker came would be complete without the ability
to get the hack hand. I introduced the hacker

215
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:29,380
card and the crypto card instead of the two
jokers. If you get a hacker, crypto, ace and

216
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:36,380
king you have the playing hand. There was
to add variation. Those of you who have purchased

217
00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:45,170
some of those decks, they came with two hackers
in them because they did a misprint because

218
00:20:45,170 --> 00:20:49,840
everything I do seems to get screwed up in
production somehow.

219
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:55,090
We actually got the crypto cards printed and
overnighted and we have them. I'm going to

220
00:20:55,090 --> 00:21:00,020
have them in my 1057 room. So if you bought
one of those decks, bring it in there. Show

221
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:07,020
me the deck and I will give you one of those
crypto cards. So there's your hack hand.

222
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:17,750
(applause).
Limited number, I think we made 2,000 or something

223
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:23,920
like that. So there is not very many. If you
guys like them, we may do a blank run for

224
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:30,920
next year or whatever. For next year, I have
been talking to Neil and DT, we think we have

225
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:38,760
a theme picked out. Won't release what the
theme is but I was very excited that Jeff

226
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:44,130
actually gave me permission to tell you guys
that we are he a going to release information

227
00:21:44,130 --> 00:21:48,270
about the badges. And it feels kind of wrong
and kind of dirty to be breaking tradition

228
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:52,400
like that, that we've been doing this for
so long. But I also think it is time to move

229
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:57,370
forward on some things. And just like in the
security field, if we don't continue to innovate

230
00:21:57,370 --> 00:22:02,630
and move forward, we'll stagnate. And I think
that's starting to happen in some areas, so

231
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:07,290
I really think we need to push the envelope
and I hope that's what we do hear at DEF CON

232
00:22:07,290 --> 00:22:14,290
and I hope that's what all of you do when
you go back to your respective schools and

233
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:21,270
places of business.
So thanks. The people in the front are clapping

234
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:28,270
for me. Yeah, come on! Innovate! Aren't you
guys tired of shit being broken? Come on.

235
00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:31,050
(applause).
So if you take a look at your badges, some

236
00:22:31,050 --> 00:22:36,400
of them, not very many, but some of them are
four‑layer boards, not two. And I won't

237
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:41,360
tell you which ones they are. But they are ‑‑
the ones generally ‑‑ the general populous

238
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:48,360
badges are a two‑layer PCB with exposed
copper a solder mask and were designed in

239
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:57,130
Eagle. The artwork could be done as vector
art in Ink Scape. So I'm hoping to inspire

240
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:06,770
you, those of you that haven't even thought
of it, you can download free tools and crank

241
00:23:06,770 --> 00:23:11,500
out a circuit board like the one you have
around your neck.

242
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:13,080
 A what?
 LosT: A circuit board which is what they

243
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:18,510
are. They are printed circuit boards, PCBs.
 (speaker off microphone.)

244
00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:25,510
 LosT: Maybe. There may be other things.
It's copper. You can solder to it. Just because

245
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,610
it doesn't look like a pad doesn't mean it
might not be.

246
00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:36,610
So, anyway, you guys like them? Are you enjoying
the badges this year?

247
00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:43,290
(applause).
You guys make the CON for me. You do. I put

248
00:23:43,290 --> 00:23:50,290
a crap ton of work into the stuff that I do.
It's a unique challenge to design cryptography

249
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:57,180
puzzle that is are designed to be broken in
a temporal space of about three days.

250
00:23:57,180 --> 00:24:01,640
For smart people like that because you are
all smarter than I am ‑‑ you are. I'm

251
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:07,390
just like this retard in my closet with a
soldering iron and coding and I slap stupid

252
00:24:07,390 --> 00:24:14,340
crap together and I come to DEF CON and barf
it out and you guys actually solve this stupid

253
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:21,340
crap that I put out every year. And I'm amazed
every single year somebody solves a piece

254
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:28,280
of the puzzle in a way that I had not even
thought of. And that's why this is a hack

255
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:32,690
CON. That's why these are my people. That's
why I can come here and do stupid crap like

256
00:24:32,690 --> 00:24:39,690
that and not have to justify myself. This
is my one time a year ‑‑ (applause).

257
00:24:43,890 --> 00:24:48,540
This is my one time a year I can go in a large
group like this and not feel like that odd

258
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:54,120
duck or I have to explain my T‑shirt or
I have to explain why I did what I did. And

259
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:58,900
I hope you all feel that way, too. And for
you guys that are new to DEF CON, everything

260
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:02,620
that I do in these contests is designed to
make you interact with each other because

261
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:07,420
I know most of us tend to be introverted based
on personality types that gravitate towards

262
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:14,420
certain fields. I have a background in mathematics.
I'm used to looking at my own shoes.

263
00:25:15,770 --> 00:25:20,060
I encourage you to talk to each other. You
have an ice breaker around your neck. You

264
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:24,410
have an excuse to say: I haven't seen that
badge yet, can I see that? In order to see

265
00:25:24,410 --> 00:25:29,340
that, you have to be close to someone. You
have to interact. I encourage you to do that.

266
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:32,620
I also encourage you to do that because it
makes solving the puzzles easier and it is

267
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:36,980
actually impossible to solve the puzzles this
year without looking at other people's badges.

268
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:40,350
Same thing was true last year and the year
before that.

269
00:25:40,350 --> 00:25:44,240
To me the most important thing that comes
out of DEF CON are the relationships that

270
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:49,650
are built here that then produce other fruits
that might not otherwise be out in the world

271
00:25:49,650 --> 00:25:53,610
because I think there's too much wrong with
what's going on. There is too much wrong in

272
00:25:53,610 --> 00:25:59,180
security. We've seen a lot of bad stuff coming
out in the news lately. And you all understand

273
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:05,710
we're odd. We're the odd folks in this ‑‑
if you go out and you think about the average

274
00:26:05,710 --> 00:26:11,110
IQ of somebody on the planet, it's kind of
frightening, yeah.

275
00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:18,110
So, anyway, I'm glad you're all here. Welcome
to DEF CON 21.

276
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:25,220
(applause)
You're going to have to be more lively than

277
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:32,210
this for your other speakers. This is open
ceremony. You have speakers up here who will

278
00:26:32,210 --> 00:26:36,040
be drinking while they present and they want
to talk to you. If somebody starts talking

279
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:41,910
bull shit in their speeches, call them on
it. That's why we are here at DEF CON. Welcome

280
00:26:41,910 --> 00:26:42,340
and have a great time.
(applause).

281
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:49,340
Do I 
release the hounds now? What do I do?
 Tell the security story.

282
00:26:56,920 --> 00:27:02,970
 LosT: You guys want to hear the TSA security
story? So I hand carried the ubers and several

283
00:27:02,970 --> 00:27:08,580
of the badges and I had them in a box and
duct taped shut with black duct tape. Probably

284
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:10,550
not the best choice.
(laughter).

285
00:27:10,550 --> 00:27:14,650
And I took it in my carry on because there
was no way in hell I was going to check this.

286
00:27:14,650 --> 00:27:20,610
This was real glass. These will break. So
I checked the box. It is going through the

287
00:27:20,610 --> 00:27:25,600
x‑ray machine and the lady is looking at
me. And she looks at the screen and she looks

288
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:29,350
back at me and I see her eye kind of raise.
She looks back at the screen and then they

289
00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:36,350
do the whole call someone else over. According
to Bruce, the security theater began. Curtain

290
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:41,270
rose and act 1 started.
(laughter).

291
00:27:41,270 --> 00:27:48,110
The TSA had another gal come over and look
at the screen and, of course, then they pull

292
00:27:48,110 --> 00:27:53,580
it out the other side of the x‑ray. Sir,
is this your bag? Yes, it is. Would you mind ‑‑

293
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:58,510
because it was in a box inside of my carry
on. So she goes, I'm going to take it out.

294
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:05,510
I said go ahead. Please be careful. It is
fragile. (laughter).

295
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:15,140
So don't ever tell TSA something is fragile
because they take that to mean explosive,

296
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:22,140
I guess. I don't know. Because, you know...
So they open up my bag and once you open the

297
00:28:22,370 --> 00:28:28,010
bag, then you can start to hear the ticking
noise that's going.

298
00:28:28,010 --> 00:28:33,820
(laughter).
TSA doesn't like little boxes wrapped in black

299
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:40,700
duct tape that tick that show up with extreme
amounts of metal in the x‑ray. Especially

300
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:46,520
when there is a big fuckin' skull on it.
(laughter)

301
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:53,520
You know what? It was fun and I'm glad I made
my flight. How's that? And consequently, that's

302
00:28:55,450 --> 00:29:00,520
not the first time this has happened to me
coming to DEF CON. I had the mystery boxes

303
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:07,120
declared as bombs at least four separate times
and we have had hotel security here as people

304
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:11,830
competing in the mystery challenge carrying
these metal boxes with mercury till sensors

305
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:18,430
on them so they are balancing them very precariously
because if they tilt them the box wails because

306
00:29:18,430 --> 00:29:24,210
I'm a jerk. (laughter).
I will give you this one and then I got to

307
00:29:24,210 --> 00:29:30,410
let you go. I had these thick steel boxes
that were made out of a tube. And they had

308
00:29:30,410 --> 00:29:35,750
locks on the top and bottom. And I put the
mercury till switch inside so they couldn't

309
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:40,210
tilt the box but they had to pick the bottom
lock first. I got these big ass heavy boxes

310
00:29:40,210 --> 00:29:44,720
they can't tilt and they have to go up through
the bottom. You have people holding these

311
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:48,580
boxes that weigh 50 pounds over the head
of some guy who is underneath trying to pick

312
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:55,580
the log from the underside. And so here's
security walks by and here's these guys holding

313
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:07,310
the box and you got this guy on the ground.
(laughter).

314
00:30:07,310 --> 00:30:11,540
And there were blinking lights on the outside.
Looked like a bomb. So, anyway, those are

315
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:15,090
the kinds of stories that I will never forget
about DEF CON. Anyway, thank you very much.

316
00:30:15,090 --> 00:30:15,370
Have a great conference.
(applause).

317
00:30:15,370 --> 00:30:15,620
 Okay, everybody. We are going to clear
the room. So if you are seated, unseat yourself

318
00:30:15,490 --> 00:30:15,740
and move towards the exits. Thanks a bunch.
