1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,459
ERIC VAN ALBERT: I'm Eric Van

2
00:00:01,459 --> 00:00:02,999
I'm David Lawrence.

3
00:00:02,999 --> 00:00:05,083
DAVID LAWRENCE: And

4
00:00:05,083 --> 00:00:06,334
here today.

5
00:00:06,334 --> 00:00:07,876
He contributed a lot to the project.

6
00:00:07,876 --> 00:00:10,999
We're just two MIT students.

7
00:00:10,999 --> 00:00:12,999
We don't have more credentials than

8
00:00:12,999 --> 00:00:15,083
Playing with locks is a hobby.

9
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,751
If you'd

10
00:00:21,751 --> 00:00:25,999
Hope you enjoy this lock.

11
00:00:25,999 --> 00:00:30,751
How many of you guys were here

12
00:00:30,751 --> 00:00:32,125
Fantastic.

13
00:00:32,125 --> 00:00:36,125
I'm going to talk

14
00:00:36,125 --> 00:00:41,334
We can do more of a quiz

15
00:00:41,334 --> 00:00:45,125
When you have

16
00:00:45,125 --> 00:00:47,000
and body and stacks constraining them

17
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,542
If you select the key, you raise

18
00:00:50,542 --> 00:00:53,250
up to the interface

19
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:55,334
allows that to turn.

20
00:00:55,334 --> 00:00:56,999
What's that interface called.

21
00:00:56,999 --> 00:00:58,626
Wonderful.

22
00:01:00,417 --> 00:01:02,918
We have I a video here.

23
00:01:03,999 --> 00:01:07,626
This is a cutaway lock so you can see

24
00:01:10,542 --> 00:01:13,918
As you insert the key, you can see

25
00:01:13,918 --> 00:01:16,501
When it's not inserted

26
00:01:16,501 --> 00:01:19,709
above the shear line so

27
00:01:19,709 --> 00:01:21,999
the pin from turning.

28
00:01:21,999 --> 00:01:26,375
If you insert it all the way

29
00:01:26,375 --> 00:01:27,375
Everybody see that?

30
00:01:27,709 --> 00:01:28,999
Great.

31
00:01:31,083 --> 00:01:34,209
These locks are vulnerable to a lot

32
00:01:34,209 --> 00:01:37,626
as Marc and Toby talked

33
00:01:37,626 --> 00:01:39,083
You can take these keys

34
00:01:39,083 --> 00:01:41,792
and they'll copy them for you.

35
00:01:43,667 --> 00:01:46,584
Another thing you can do is picking.

36
00:01:46,834 --> 00:01:52,250
And inserting long wires

37
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:54,999
I'll go over those quickly

38
00:01:54,999 --> 00:01:56,959
about them a lot.

39
00:01:56,959 --> 00:02:00,751
Picking is where you exploit

40
00:02:00,751 --> 00:02:02,999
By applying torque

41
00:02:02,999 --> 00:02:05,751
all the pin stacks to bind.

42
00:02:05,999 --> 00:02:07,959
In a perfect lock they would all bind

43
00:02:07,959 --> 00:02:09,959
at that point you'd be screwed.

44
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:11,999
But because the holes are slightly

45
00:02:11,999 --> 00:02:14,999
on the plug, only one of them

46
00:02:15,209 --> 00:02:17,083
And if you use a pick

47
00:02:17,083 --> 00:02:20,209
up to the shear line, then it will set

48
00:02:20,209 --> 00:02:24,083
a very small amount and it will trap

49
00:02:24,083 --> 00:02:27,125
down and then you don't have

50
00:02:27,125 --> 00:02:31,542
and you can repeat that

51
00:02:33,209 --> 00:02:35,542
Impressioning I'm not going to go

52
00:02:35,542 --> 00:02:37,834
because I'm not very good at it.

53
00:02:37,834 --> 00:02:39,792
It involves taking a blank key,

54
00:02:39,792 --> 00:02:42,999
and using the torque and binding action

55
00:02:42,999 --> 00:02:45,292
and you can file

56
00:02:45,292 --> 00:02:47,375
up with a working key.

57
00:02:47,918 --> 00:02:50,999
So pin tumbler locks

58
00:02:50,999 --> 00:02:54,918
for the sleighing prime us

59
00:02:54,918 --> 00:02:58,792
of the Schlage Primus key there

60
00:02:58,792 --> 00:03:01,999
the SCHLAGE

61
00:03:01,999 --> 00:03:06,209
which is the squiggly line on the top

62
00:03:06,501 --> 00:03:08,999
We're going to call that

63
00:03:10,501 --> 00:03:12,542
Now an important part

64
00:03:12,542 --> 00:03:15,959
is you can completely separate these

65
00:03:15,999 --> 00:03:18,999
In fact, we've cut a couple keys

66
00:03:18,999 --> 00:03:21,626
the side bar or just the top bidding.

67
00:03:21,918 --> 00:03:25,959
Now, here's a side bar only.

68
00:03:27,083 --> 00:03:31,417
And then here is a full key,

69
00:03:31,417 --> 00:03:34,083
the side milling on it.

70
00:03:38,626 --> 00:03:42,167
Can anybody pick a Primus lock,

71
00:03:42,709 --> 00:03:46,459
One guy in the back.

72
00:03:46,459 --> 00:03:47,459
I salute you.

73
00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:48,999
Much more skilled than I am.

74
00:03:49,083 --> 00:03:51,292
We cannot pick Primus locks.

75
00:03:51,292 --> 00:03:52,918
I have one friend who can do it.

76
00:03:52,918 --> 00:03:55,459
He's very good at it but we have

77
00:03:55,459 --> 00:03:57,292
of opening these.

78
00:03:57,584 --> 00:04:00,709
Now, what we're going to do

79
00:04:00,709 --> 00:04:05,417
at keyless entry, we're going to look

80
00:04:05,417 --> 00:04:07,542
So this is basically using information

81
00:04:07,542 --> 00:04:10,918
you gather somehow about the key

82
00:04:10,918 --> 00:04:12,501
to the lock.

83
00:04:13,209 --> 00:04:16,083
There's a lot of things in place

84
00:04:16,083 --> 00:04:18,584
The way you get these keys

85
00:04:18,584 --> 00:04:22,834
to send them proof that you are who

86
00:04:22,834 --> 00:04:27,834
And you're entitled to get keys,

87
00:04:27,834 --> 00:04:30,292
This key is blank

88
00:04:30,292 --> 00:04:31,999
bidding on it.

89
00:04:31,999 --> 00:04:33,667
But it does have a side bar.

90
00:04:33,667 --> 00:04:36,167
Schlage claims they're

91
00:04:36,167 --> 00:04:39,459
side bar and they go

92
00:04:39,459 --> 00:04:42,250
a lot of money to get side bars.

93
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:47,709
In order to attack this lock,

94
00:04:47,709 --> 00:04:50,334
first we have to figure out how

95
00:04:50,334 --> 00:04:53,459
and how it actuates the parts

96
00:04:53,501 --> 00:04:55,999
We're going to create a 3D model

97
00:04:55,999 --> 00:04:59,667
is the first step

98
00:04:59,667 --> 00:05:02,626
Then we're going to look at additive

99
00:05:02,626 --> 00:05:07,375
and implication of this for Primus

100
00:05:07,792 --> 00:05:12,292
All right, so we'll start

101
00:05:12,292 --> 00:05:19,501
we're calling it reverse engineering

102
00:05:19,501 --> 00:05:22,375
There's no great amount

103
00:05:22,375 --> 00:05:25,209
So start out with a Primus key

104
00:05:25,209 --> 00:05:26,999
about the lock.

105
00:05:27,209 --> 00:05:28,876
And what does it say on it?

106
00:05:28,876 --> 00:05:31,834
Primus, do not duplicate.

107
00:05:32,292 --> 00:05:35,751
Actually, we may have to end

108
00:05:35,751 --> 00:05:37,375
all for come.

109
00:05:39,999 --> 00:05:43,167
(Laughter) The third line of the key

110
00:05:43,167 --> 00:05:44,167
A U.S.

111
00:05:44,167 --> 00:05:45,167
patent number.

112
00:05:45,542 --> 00:05:49,542
I'm guess Schlage thinks this

113
00:05:55,375 --> 00:05:57,334
But actually U.S.

114
00:05:57,334 --> 00:05:58,792
patent filings are public.

115
00:05:58,792 --> 00:06:01,999
So you look it

116
00:06:01,999 --> 00:06:05,999
of about 20 pages

117
00:06:05,999 --> 00:06:09,542
explaining exactly how it works.

118
00:06:09,792 --> 00:06:13,334
So you can see that

119
00:06:13,334 --> 00:06:15,999
on the top of the key.

120
00:06:15,999 --> 00:06:19,250
There are 5 additional cuts

121
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:21,167
And there's

122
00:06:21,167 --> 00:06:26,209
on the side of the lock which

123
00:06:26,209 --> 00:06:28,250
We'll take a closer look at that soon.

124
00:06:28,918 --> 00:06:34,375
You read through the patent

125
00:06:34,709 --> 00:06:38,959
But there's a lot more information that's

126
00:06:38,999 --> 00:06:43,751
So suppose you do a Google search

127
00:06:43,751 --> 00:06:45,999
Well, there you are.

128
00:06:46,751 --> 00:06:49,999
They have it up on their Web site.

129
00:06:50,083 --> 00:06:53,876
And if we look inside there, there

130
00:06:53,876 --> 00:06:56,417
that they've provided to us.

131
00:06:56,999 --> 00:07:02,999
So here you can see how that side

132
00:07:02,999 --> 00:07:02,999
There's an L.

133
00:07:02,999 --> 00:07:05,999
shaped pin called

134
00:07:05,999 --> 00:07:09,501
down in the grooves on the side

135
00:07:09,709 --> 00:07:12,459
That meshes

136
00:07:12,459 --> 00:07:17,209
to the side bar in the previous talk,

137
00:07:17,792 --> 00:07:21,667
And when those finger pins are lined

138
00:07:21,667 --> 00:07:26,083
as you can see in the drawings at right,

139
00:07:26,083 --> 00:07:28,584
the cylinder can open.

140
00:07:28,834 --> 00:07:31,584
If the finger pins are not aligned

141
00:07:31,584 --> 00:07:35,709
the side bar and that will prevent

142
00:07:36,083 --> 00:07:38,709
So the fingers pins have got

143
00:07:38,709 --> 00:07:41,209
and rotated to the correct angle.

144
00:07:41,209 --> 00:07:42,999
They have two degrees of freedom.

145
00:07:43,292 --> 00:07:45,083
So let's take a look.

146
00:07:45,334 --> 00:07:49,626
Here is a cutaway lock and side bar

147
00:07:49,626 --> 00:07:51,876
the finger pins.

148
00:07:51,999 --> 00:07:54,918
You'll see them moving

149
00:07:54,918 --> 00:07:59,250
to be misaligned until the key

150
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:01,999
of them will be lined up.

151
00:08:04,292 --> 00:08:08,999
Until you rotate it back and forth

152
00:08:08,999 --> 00:08:10,999
of light on them.

153
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:13,999
You see there they rotate.

154
00:08:17,626 --> 00:08:21,292
Until the key is all the way

155
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:25,876
and if the wrong side bar is us used

156
00:08:30,834 --> 00:08:34,999
That's basically it

157
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:37,125
If there are any missing details,

158
00:08:37,125 --> 00:08:39,792
of course take one apart and look.

159
00:08:39,834 --> 00:08:41,209
But it turns out that

160
00:08:41,209 --> 00:08:45,626
at lock Wiki already did that and put

161
00:08:46,334 --> 00:08:50,876
So all you have to do is look

162
00:08:50,876 --> 00:08:55,083
and you can see exactly how this side

163
00:08:55,083 --> 00:08:56,999
It's got little notches

164
00:08:56,999 --> 00:09:00,709
on the finger pins that fit

165
00:09:00,709 --> 00:09:03,626
as the bump is in the right spot.

166
00:09:04,209 --> 00:09:10,083
This is the lock and Schlage believes

167
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:15,459
secure, resistant to duplication

168
00:09:16,375 --> 00:09:18,417
And they're almost right.

169
00:09:19,999 --> 00:09:24,999
So next thing we'll take a look

170
00:09:24,999 --> 00:09:28,417
So that is now that you have

171
00:09:28,417 --> 00:09:32,375
out the exact dimensions that are

172
00:09:32,375 --> 00:09:37,709
the finger pins and the pin on the top

173
00:09:37,709 --> 00:09:39,626
into the lock.

174
00:09:39,918 --> 00:09:44,083
So we'll start out with a top

175
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:46,375
This is a page from the service manual.

176
00:09:46,417 --> 00:09:50,125
This is backwards compatible

177
00:09:50,125 --> 00:09:54,459
of this is secret at all and this

178
00:09:54,459 --> 00:09:56,999
for the top of the key.

179
00:09:57,626 --> 00:09:59,999
The side of the key

180
00:09:59,999 --> 00:10:04,459
because all Schlage tells you

181
00:10:04,459 --> 00:10:06,876
They can be left, center or right.

182
00:10:06,876 --> 00:10:08,918
And high or low.

183
00:10:08,999 --> 00:10:11,375
So what we did to figure

184
00:10:11,375 --> 00:10:14,999
for this not using any special tools,

185
00:10:14,999 --> 00:10:18,000
on a flatbed scanner run them

186
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,876
and exact the parameters.

187
00:10:20,999 --> 00:10:23,459
We got nice results.

188
00:10:23,751 --> 00:10:24,876
Here they are.

189
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:25,999
Now you know.

190
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:30,250
You can also see here a picture

191
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:33,999
those different positions map

192
00:10:34,125 --> 00:10:39,834
This is side bar 64246 deep right,

193
00:10:39,834 --> 00:10:42,667
deep left, deep right.

194
00:10:43,751 --> 00:10:46,834
And that's about it for this side pitting.

195
00:10:46,999 --> 00:10:50,417
There are a couple other things we have

196
00:10:50,417 --> 00:10:52,792
a key that can be used.

197
00:10:53,542 --> 00:10:55,918
We have a minimum slope

198
00:10:55,918 --> 00:10:58,542
down to each cut

199
00:10:58,542 --> 00:11:00,999
to rotate, that's got

200
00:11:00,999 --> 00:11:03,626
down to the bottom of the cup.

201
00:11:03,999 --> 00:11:07,125
Otherwise, the friction

202
00:11:07,334 --> 00:11:08,751
There's also

203
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:12,709
because if it's the ramp is too steep,

204
00:11:12,709 --> 00:11:15,792
the key won't be able to go in and out.

205
00:11:15,792 --> 00:11:18,292
So because there's this rotating pin you

206
00:11:18,292 --> 00:11:21,792
out these two factors and there's only

207
00:11:21,792 --> 00:11:23,959
of slopes that work.

208
00:11:24,334 --> 00:11:26,999
And finally the bottom

209
00:11:26,999 --> 00:11:30,792
to match the curvature

210
00:11:30,876 --> 00:11:33,751
So we went through and figured

211
00:11:33,751 --> 00:11:36,999
as well And that's it

212
00:11:36,999 --> 00:11:40,918
for all of the control surfaces

213
00:11:40,918 --> 00:11:43,999
With this, you can put

214
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:47,334
All the finger pins in the right place

215
00:11:47,459 --> 00:11:48,999
Of course, the last piece

216
00:11:48,999 --> 00:11:52,167
a key cross section that will fit

217
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:55,501
Now, eventually,

218
00:11:55,501 --> 00:11:59,417
in all of their standard Primus locks

219
00:11:59,417 --> 00:12:05,334
a bit more material from that, it fits

220
00:12:05,501 --> 00:12:09,959
And we speculate that the reason this

221
00:12:09,959 --> 00:12:15,375
the side bar mechanism imposes such

222
00:12:15,375 --> 00:12:21,999
and that the key has got

223
00:12:21,999 --> 00:12:22,999
This one.

224
00:12:22,999 --> 00:12:26,417
There's got to be a big hole

225
00:12:26,417 --> 00:12:30,626
the finger pins can ride

226
00:12:30,626 --> 00:12:35,083
There's got to be side bar there's got

227
00:12:35,334 --> 00:12:38,083
There's very little flexibility

228
00:12:38,083 --> 00:12:40,083
around the side bar.

229
00:12:40,334 --> 00:12:44,375
So in that respect, the side bar

230
00:12:44,375 --> 00:12:48,459
a regular lock where there could be

231
00:12:48,459 --> 00:12:49,876
a key.

232
00:12:49,999 --> 00:12:54,959
And once we have that key cross

233
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:58,709
all these pieces together

234
00:12:59,083 --> 00:13:03,083
And to do that, we used

235
00:13:03,167 --> 00:13:05,999
Open S cut

236
00:13:05,999 --> 00:13:10,083
like syntax that compiled to 3d models.

237
00:13:10,083 --> 00:13:16,751
It was first used to model keys

238
00:13:16,751 --> 00:13:19,209
So we saw that and thought it was

239
00:13:19,209 --> 00:13:21,999
and implemented the Primus key.

240
00:13:21,999 --> 00:13:24,083
It was only a few hundred lines of code.

241
00:13:24,083 --> 00:13:25,501
Not a lot of work.

242
00:13:25,959 --> 00:13:29,083
Considering the purported security

243
00:13:29,459 --> 00:13:31,709
Here's an example of what it looks like.

244
00:13:31,709 --> 00:13:34,083
This is our top level function called key.

245
00:13:34,209 --> 00:13:36,626
Which is taking the top code

246
00:13:36,626 --> 00:13:40,083
and it's calling out to a bunch

247
00:13:40,083 --> 00:13:43,417
to draw the top of the key and

248
00:13:43,417 --> 00:13:47,083
out all of the bumps that need

249
00:13:47,459 --> 00:13:49,876
And this is what you get.

250
00:13:49,876 --> 00:13:53,959
You call the function key and get

251
00:13:53,959 --> 00:14:00,334
working Primus key (Applause.)

252
00:14:00,334 --> 00:14:06,083
we'll tell you about a bunch

253
00:14:06,083 --> 00:14:10,876
to easily and cheaply fabricate these.

254
00:14:10,876 --> 00:14:12,999
Three D models are great

255
00:14:12,999 --> 00:14:14,999
if you can't make it.

256
00:14:15,999 --> 00:14:17,999
Has anybody filed keys?

257
00:14:17,999 --> 00:14:18,999
Show of hands.

258
00:14:20,584 --> 00:14:23,083
Take a file, work it for a while.

259
00:14:23,083 --> 00:14:26,999
It takes a steady hand, a pair

260
00:14:26,999 --> 00:14:31,626
Now we thought that hand machining

261
00:14:31,834 --> 00:14:35,501
Until one day our friend Rob sends us

262
00:14:35,501 --> 00:14:38,292
by hand opening a Primus lock.

263
00:14:38,501 --> 00:14:41,083
And we're like wow,

264
00:14:41,083 --> 00:14:43,459
He used very complicated tools,

265
00:14:43,459 --> 00:14:48,999
He used a dremel, a pair of calipers

266
00:14:48,999 --> 00:14:51,083
Only material cost

267
00:14:51,083 --> 00:14:54,459
he basically described

268
00:14:54,459 --> 00:14:57,792
all of the dimensions

269
00:14:57,792 --> 00:14:59,999
with dremel

270
00:14:59,999 --> 00:15:03,417
and stuck it in the lock and it worked.

271
00:15:04,876 --> 00:15:06,999
He's done it

272
00:15:06,999 --> 00:15:10,125
the 11 numbers describing the key

273
00:15:10,125 --> 00:15:12,626
a key that will open the lock.

274
00:15:12,626 --> 00:15:14,584
It's fantastic.

275
00:15:14,999 --> 00:15:17,292
Here's photos of the process.

276
00:15:17,292 --> 00:15:18,999
You can see

277
00:15:18,999 --> 00:15:21,918
in the Primus key way

278
00:15:21,918 --> 00:15:25,209
to prevent you from breaking

279
00:15:25,959 --> 00:15:27,792
Thin it down using the dremel.

280
00:15:27,792 --> 00:15:31,250
You see the complicated tools we have

281
00:15:31,709 --> 00:15:33,918
It also happens that 0 you are key

282
00:15:33,918 --> 00:15:35,876
as our kitchen table.

283
00:15:36,334 --> 00:15:38,584
So once the key is thinned

284
00:15:38,584 --> 00:15:42,209
in the Primus key way you can start

285
00:15:42,209 --> 00:15:45,584
to setting into and here we've got two

286
00:15:45,584 --> 00:15:50,083
And you basically scribe

287
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:54,918
scribes more measure repeat ad

288
00:15:55,125 --> 00:15:57,999
Here it is with almost

289
00:15:57,999 --> 00:16:00,459
of polishing it

290
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:02,999
in the lock and it opens.

291
00:16:02,999 --> 00:16:05,751
And we have that to show you now.

292
00:16:06,292 --> 00:16:09,959
Here's the hardware store key blank.

293
00:16:10,167 --> 00:16:14,083
This one I think was 25 cents

294
00:16:15,459 --> 00:16:19,375
Here is the result.

295
00:16:22,125 --> 00:16:24,999
There's the part we dremel'd out.

296
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:31,751
Here's the stock key

297
00:16:31,751 --> 00:16:35,334
See that biting there compared to ours.

298
00:16:35,501 --> 00:16:38,083
And let's put it in the lock.

299
00:16:38,083 --> 00:16:40,542
Here's

300
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:42,999
That works fine.

301
00:16:43,209 --> 00:16:46,083
Here's our key opening the lock.

302
00:16:46,542 --> 00:16:56,292
(Applause)    So that's it.

303
00:16:56,292 --> 00:16:57,542
Yeah, you can dremel it.

304
00:16:59,167 --> 00:17:01,999
If you've had

305
00:17:01,999 --> 00:17:03,876
you can do this.

306
00:17:07,209 --> 00:17:09,959
This is how Schlage makes their keys.

307
00:17:12,876 --> 00:17:14,709
They mill

308
00:17:14,709 --> 00:17:16,459
numerical control.

309
00:17:16,626 --> 00:17:21,083
If you are interested outsourcing this

310
00:17:21,083 --> 00:17:23,167
the setup cost

311
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:27,792
because you have to there's a lot

312
00:17:27,792 --> 00:17:31,959
of common milling machines don't have

313
00:17:31,959 --> 00:17:35,709
to operate the small tool diameters you

314
00:17:36,083 --> 00:17:40,209
And so the a better tool than

315
00:17:40,209 --> 00:17:45,375
is probably a desktop micro mill

316
00:17:45,375 --> 00:17:47,999
through the market.

317
00:17:47,999 --> 00:17:49,501
Keep ap eye out for ones

318
00:17:49,501 --> 00:17:53,167
will run you probably

319
00:17:53,167 --> 00:17:56,792
The other shown here is another mill

320
00:17:56,792 --> 00:17:59,083
of milling

321
00:17:59,083 --> 00:18:01,125
into a Primus key.

322
00:18:01,125 --> 00:18:02,501
This is not out yet.

323
00:18:02,501 --> 00:18:04,250
It's a funded kick starter project.

324
00:18:04,959 --> 00:18:08,999
But the most exciting thing we tried

325
00:18:08,999 --> 00:18:11,999
a new space

326
00:18:11,999 --> 00:18:15,999
printers have hit the levels

327
00:18:15,999 --> 00:18:18,334
a high security lock.

328
00:18:18,542 --> 00:18:24,834
So we took that 3d model and just sent

329
00:18:24,834 --> 00:18:26,709
Shapeways.com and iDotmaterialize.

330
00:18:27,292 --> 00:18:30,709
We got keys back

331
00:18:30,999 --> 00:18:36,083
We tried two different mastic processes

332
00:18:36,125 --> 00:18:39,250
And well, it turns out that

333
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:41,751
(Laughter) So we're going

334
00:18:46,999 --> 00:18:52,334
(Applause)    The first material we tried

335
00:18:52,334 --> 00:18:55,626
frosted ultra detail

336
00:18:55,626 --> 00:18:58,999
as much precision as we can here.

337
00:18:59,375 --> 00:19:03,999
And this is a stereo process secured.

338
00:19:04,334 --> 00:19:05,999
Very expensive.

339
00:19:05,999 --> 00:19:09,999
There's a 5 dollar setup cost

340
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:11,999
How much is it going to cost you

341
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:13,999
at the hardware store.

342
00:19:14,083 --> 00:19:15,083
$3?

343
00:19:16,375 --> 00:19:19,083
Precision was excellent.

344
00:19:19,209 --> 00:19:20,999
We measured it.

345
00:19:20,999 --> 00:19:21,999
It was great.

346
00:19:21,999 --> 00:19:25,083
Issue was it was not that strong.

347
00:19:25,209 --> 00:19:28,999
It was plenty strong to attack

348
00:19:28,999 --> 00:19:32,209
but when it comes

349
00:19:32,209 --> 00:19:37,334
the half spot at rust padlock,

350
00:19:37,999 --> 00:19:40,709
But there are a lot

351
00:19:40,709 --> 00:19:43,209
like figuring out whether you have

352
00:19:43,209 --> 00:19:47,918
for a lock or removing the cylinder

353
00:19:50,083 --> 00:19:52,083
What's it it looks like.

354
00:19:52,083 --> 00:19:53,083
We don't put the bumps

355
00:19:53,083 --> 00:19:56,083
because they're useless

356
00:19:56,083 --> 00:19:58,501
There it is.

357
00:19:58,501 --> 00:20:01,501
There it goes going

358
00:20:01,501 --> 00:20:03,417
real smooth.

359
00:20:09,584 --> 00:20:13,667
(Applause.) Next thing was different

360
00:20:13,667 --> 00:20:15,876
strong and flexible.

361
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:17,959
This is laser centered nylon.

362
00:20:19,042 --> 00:20:21,125
This is cheaper.

363
00:20:21,125 --> 00:20:23,083
Only $3 total.

364
00:20:23,709 --> 00:20:25,999
The issue here was the precision.

365
00:20:25,999 --> 00:20:28,959
This is not

366
00:20:28,999 --> 00:20:31,000
It's not high resolution but it's enough.

367
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:34,292
It's less smooth going into the lock.

368
00:20:34,292 --> 00:20:37,751
Sometimes you've got to give it

369
00:20:37,751 --> 00:20:42,626
enough to operate most locks

370
00:20:42,626 --> 00:20:44,334
So we can take a look at that.

371
00:20:44,459 --> 00:20:47,709
See if you can see the side bar there.

372
00:20:47,709 --> 00:20:48,709
It's hard.

373
00:20:48,709 --> 00:20:50,584
Yeah, there is a side bar.

374
00:20:50,584 --> 00:20:52,626
It's just hiding.

375
00:20:54,542 --> 00:20:57,999
Little harder to insert

376
00:20:57,999 --> 00:21:01,125
it opens fine and it's quite strong.

377
00:21:04,292 --> 00:21:06,999
By the way, we got old FL.

378
00:21:06,999 --> 00:21:10,083
This is a key that doesn't open anything

379
00:21:10,083 --> 00:21:12,999
an idea how brittle the first one was.

380
00:21:13,417 --> 00:21:14,501
That's it.

381
00:21:15,083 --> 00:21:17,083
So you don't want that happening

382
00:21:17,083 --> 00:21:20,459
of cases where you might be using

383
00:21:21,999 --> 00:21:24,792
And then the third thing we tried just

384
00:21:24,792 --> 00:21:28,083
out is this titanium process which

385
00:21:28,083 --> 00:21:32,292
to deposit titanium powder

386
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:35,626
And that turned out awesome.

387
00:21:35,626 --> 00:21:39,083
The down side is it ran us $150

388
00:21:39,999 --> 00:21:43,918
But you want to show that?

389
00:21:43,918 --> 00:21:49,334
It is an amazing looking thing.

390
00:21:49,334 --> 00:21:52,459
We measured it and it was more precise

391
00:21:52,459 --> 00:21:54,292
you how good it is.

392
00:21:54,292 --> 00:21:55,834
But it's certainly

393
00:21:55,834 --> 00:21:58,209
the Schlage factory, most likely.

394
00:21:58,209 --> 00:21:59,209
Yep.

395
00:21:59,209 --> 00:22:00,209
Here it is.

396
00:22:00,209 --> 00:22:04,709
We go into the lock and no problem.

397
00:22:04,999 --> 00:22:06,999
This stuff is super strong.

398
00:22:06,999 --> 00:22:15,959
(Applause.)    So there it is,

399
00:22:15,959 --> 00:22:19,209
I suspect there are many more ways

400
00:22:19,209 --> 00:22:23,834
of these outfits are just starting

401
00:22:23,834 --> 00:22:27,667
they have 3d printers that print in wax.

402
00:22:27,667 --> 00:22:30,083
And maybe they'll even give you

403
00:22:30,209 --> 00:22:31,999
So we have no reason

404
00:22:31,999 --> 00:22:35,834
of these other processes wouldn't work

405
00:22:35,999 --> 00:22:40,292
And we also expect

406
00:22:40,292 --> 00:22:42,999
Because

407
00:22:42,999 --> 00:22:47,999
is the white 1 and titanium are currently

408
00:22:47,999 --> 00:22:52,751
a royalty fee that's part

409
00:22:52,751 --> 00:22:54,209
in 2014.

410
00:22:55,876 --> 00:23:00,667
Historically speaking, when

411
00:23:00,667 --> 00:23:02,999
went down 25 30%.

412
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:05,834
And we start seeing things

413
00:23:05,834 --> 00:23:09,125
So that's going to be exciting.

414
00:23:09,417 --> 00:23:13,209
Maybe we'll get

415
00:23:16,083 --> 00:23:19,209
Finally, let's take a look

416
00:23:19,709 --> 00:23:24,459
So first for Primus locks,

417
00:23:24,999 --> 00:23:27,834
We know all of these dimensions now,

418
00:23:27,834 --> 00:23:31,250
is a key or else a picture

419
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:35,584
if you've got a sense of you know,

420
00:23:35,751 --> 00:23:37,334
But it's not going to be hard.

421
00:23:37,334 --> 00:23:41,250
Especially if you're decoding that side

422
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:43,250
Because there's only six possibilities

423
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:45,626
they look quite different.

424
00:23:46,542 --> 00:23:51,167
Of course that means key duplication

425
00:23:51,167 --> 00:23:54,999
your key you're going to need

426
00:23:54,999 --> 00:23:58,501
to ship off to shapeways and that's it.

427
00:23:58,501 --> 00:24:01,209
You've got your copy

428
00:24:01,209 --> 00:24:05,083
going to the hardware store

429
00:24:06,292 --> 00:24:10,999
So one thing this means

430
00:24:11,334 --> 00:24:15,792
It's standard attack that can be

431
00:24:15,792 --> 00:24:18,792
in which you start

432
00:24:18,792 --> 00:24:22,417
and a couple of key blanks

433
00:24:22,417 --> 00:24:27,083
out one pin at a time to find where

434
00:24:27,459 --> 00:24:30,250
In a master system, the side bar

435
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:33,626
because that's built

436
00:24:33,626 --> 00:24:37,292
the ability to produce blocks

437
00:24:37,292 --> 00:24:39,999
the same attack and this

438
00:24:39,999 --> 00:24:42,459
a regular pin tumbler lock.

439
00:24:42,459 --> 00:24:44,834
Have you seen the Matt blaze paper.

440
00:24:47,999 --> 00:24:50,999
Matt blaze master keyed systems.

441
00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:55,999
(Talking simultaneously.)    But

442
00:24:55,999 --> 00:24:58,709
These are still a pain to pick.

443
00:24:59,083 --> 00:25:01,167
So we're just looking at starting

444
00:25:01,167 --> 00:25:04,292
of the information contained in a key.

445
00:25:04,375 --> 00:25:06,918
Although note that's not going

446
00:25:06,918 --> 00:25:10,167
by there's been other work

447
00:25:10,167 --> 00:25:14,334
there's a key at Berkeley I believe

448
00:25:14,334 --> 00:25:18,334
have been at one

449
00:25:18,334 --> 00:25:21,250
They successfully decoded

450
00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:25,083
from a guy sitting at a table

451
00:25:25,083 --> 00:25:30,250
of a 4 story building

452
00:25:30,542 --> 00:25:33,083
If you see anyone walking

453
00:25:33,083 --> 00:25:35,626
from their belt,

454
00:25:35,626 --> 00:25:37,459
of one of those.

455
00:25:38,334 --> 00:25:39,584
All right.

456
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:41,292
So we're going to have

457
00:25:41,292 --> 00:25:44,667
want to use a Primus lock

458
00:25:44,999 --> 00:25:49,334
If you're using Primus locks already,

459
00:25:49,334 --> 00:25:53,083
if anyone at all can go duplicate a key.

460
00:25:53,959 --> 00:25:56,751
It's not new that you can duplicate

461
00:25:56,751 --> 00:25:58,999
You could get a machinist

462
00:25:58,999 --> 00:26:01,334
But what's new is anyone can do it.

463
00:26:01,584 --> 00:26:04,334
There's no barrier in terms

464
00:26:04,334 --> 00:26:07,999
No cost barrier, anyone who feels

465
00:26:08,709 --> 00:26:13,083
But the interesting thing

466
00:26:13,083 --> 00:26:15,334
to Primus locks.

467
00:26:15,918 --> 00:26:19,501
There's no specific weakness

468
00:26:19,709 --> 00:26:22,792
Any physical lock

469
00:26:22,792 --> 00:26:24,584
and printed.

470
00:26:24,999 --> 00:26:29,999
So it's an industry wide problem that's

471
00:26:29,999 --> 00:26:33,083
up now 3d printing

472
00:26:33,083 --> 00:26:35,999
to have these precisions.

473
00:26:36,209 --> 00:26:39,501
Key duplication

474
00:26:41,459 --> 00:26:44,125
It will be like pirating movies.

475
00:26:44,334 --> 00:26:47,751
It still takes one person who can go

476
00:26:47,751 --> 00:26:51,125
or take their video camera

477
00:26:51,417 --> 00:26:53,083
But as soon as they've done it,

478
00:26:53,083 --> 00:26:54,999
to download the movie.

479
00:26:55,250 --> 00:26:59,083
It takes one person to model a key

480
00:26:59,083 --> 00:27:02,417
and download and print them off.

481
00:27:02,501 --> 00:27:06,209
So I think we'll find those people

482
00:27:07,417 --> 00:27:09,501
Physical security

483
00:27:09,501 --> 00:27:11,751
on information security.

484
00:27:11,959 --> 00:27:14,083
We're breaking

485
00:27:14,083 --> 00:27:16,999
by writing code for a key.

486
00:27:16,999 --> 00:27:18,375
I think that's cool.

487
00:27:21,334 --> 00:27:23,792
Patent protection

488
00:27:23,792 --> 00:27:26,959
for lock companies

489
00:27:26,959 --> 00:27:30,083
to threaten legal action

490
00:27:30,083 --> 00:27:34,334
physical reproductions

491
00:27:34,334 --> 00:27:39,334
I don't think they'll be able to go

492
00:27:39,334 --> 00:27:43,999
the same information included

493
00:27:43,999 --> 00:27:48,083
Go after each individual person that

494
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:49,999
of these keys.

495
00:27:49,999 --> 00:27:51,999
But I don't think they'll be able

496
00:27:51,999 --> 00:27:53,792
the distribution

497
00:27:53,792 --> 00:27:55,584
on a patented key.

498
00:27:55,584 --> 00:27:57,999
But we're not lawyers.

499
00:27:57,999 --> 00:28:00,083
You should talk to Marc Weber Tobias.

500
00:28:02,584 --> 00:28:07,709
Lawyers can make your day suck

501
00:28:08,999 --> 00:28:14,876
Here's other keys this

502
00:28:14,876 --> 00:28:18,417
This is all recent work

503
00:28:18,417 --> 00:28:20,334
This is for a mini Cooper.

504
00:28:20,334 --> 00:28:23,999
This does nothing about the chip

505
00:28:23,999 --> 00:28:25,876
the real key.

506
00:28:26,834 --> 00:28:29,375
It works for the physical section.

507
00:28:29,751 --> 00:28:33,626
This is used commonly in bike locks.

508
00:28:33,709 --> 00:28:34,918
Other stuff.

509
00:28:35,083 --> 00:28:38,167
People have three d printed handcuff

510
00:28:40,083 --> 00:28:42,083
Field is wide open.

511
00:28:42,083 --> 00:28:45,999
Anything that's a physical lock,

512
00:28:45,999 --> 00:28:49,999
up wherever it

513
00:28:49,999 --> 00:28:53,083
and people can print it out.

514
00:28:53,999 --> 00:28:56,584
We have audience projects here that

515
00:28:56,584 --> 00:28:59,083
if someone else wanted to do.

516
00:28:59,125 --> 00:29:02,334
We'd like to see 3d models

517
00:29:02,334 --> 00:29:06,167
in open S cat because it's not that hard.

518
00:29:06,375 --> 00:29:08,375
Especially Medeco which a lot

519
00:29:08,375 --> 00:29:11,999
is the highest security

520
00:29:12,334 --> 00:29:14,918
If you've ever looked

521
00:29:14,918 --> 00:29:18,667
he's published most

522
00:29:18,999 --> 00:29:22,209
Probably print out a model of that

523
00:29:22,999 --> 00:29:26,999
It would be neat to integrate models

524
00:29:26,999 --> 00:29:34,083
the process fully automatic especially

525
00:29:34,083 --> 00:29:36,083
That should be fairly straightforward.

526
00:29:36,083 --> 00:29:38,334
Maybe there's a market

527
00:29:38,334 --> 00:29:39,334
iPhone app.

528
00:29:39,334 --> 00:29:41,999
Take a picture of your key, get

529
00:29:46,751 --> 00:29:51,792
It would be neat to have a place to go

530
00:29:51,792 --> 00:29:54,792
for pirate bay for keys.

531
00:29:56,250 --> 00:29:59,709
And here's some food for thought.

532
00:29:59,709 --> 00:30:00,959
If you're

533
00:30:00,959 --> 00:30:02,417
about these.

534
00:30:03,083 --> 00:30:05,834
There's a lot

535
00:30:05,834 --> 00:30:10,542
because a retired locksmith was selling

536
00:30:12,501 --> 00:30:15,709
Called him the master keys

537
00:30:15,876 --> 00:30:19,834
These are keys that are used

538
00:30:19,834 --> 00:30:25,250
fire departments in New York City,

539
00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:30,834
to electrical circuit breaker boxes

540
00:30:31,501 --> 00:30:36,417
People were getting upset that

541
00:30:36,417 --> 00:30:38,042
But what's going

542
00:30:38,042 --> 00:30:40,584
the 3d models for these keys?

543
00:30:40,584 --> 00:30:43,417
These have got to be in hundreds

544
00:30:43,417 --> 00:30:45,417
There's no way to change these locks.

545
00:30:46,083 --> 00:30:51,626
The interesting thing

546
00:30:51,626 --> 00:30:59,167
by the New York post has probably got

547
00:30:59,167 --> 00:31:02,999
ahead and do it right now.

548
00:31:02,999 --> 00:31:05,918
(Laughter) (Applause) Also, one

549
00:31:05,918 --> 00:31:09,751
manufacturers uses the same key

550
00:31:09,751 --> 00:31:14,999
and I believe that they put a picture

551
00:31:14,999 --> 00:31:16,667
On their online storefront.

552
00:31:16,667 --> 00:31:20,667
Even if not, how long will it be

553
00:31:20,667 --> 00:31:25,542
Models it, dollar, two dollars, buy

554
00:31:26,792 --> 00:31:31,751
If three d printing keeps picking

555
00:31:31,751 --> 00:31:36,375
to be a major change in the field

556
00:31:38,125 --> 00:31:41,334
So I think that's about all we have here.

557
00:31:41,959 --> 00:31:44,334
We have a couple people to think.

558
00:31:44,375 --> 00:31:46,292
Yeah, sure.

559
00:31:47,542 --> 00:31:50,167
A lot of people worked on this

560
00:31:50,167 --> 00:31:51,876
of us up here.

561
00:31:51,876 --> 00:31:53,751
I'll like to thank Gabe,

562
00:31:53,751 --> 00:31:57,626
of course Rob who couldn't be here

563
00:31:57,626 --> 00:32:00,999
the person manufacturing

564
00:32:00,999 --> 00:32:04,959
and Schlage for publishing

565
00:32:04,959 --> 00:32:08,999
the MIT lock sport community

566
00:32:08,999 --> 00:32:11,167
in the first place.

567
00:32:11,876 --> 00:32:13,334
Thank you very much.

568
00:32:13,334 --> 00:32:17,083
(Applause.)    So we have quite a bit

569
00:32:17,083 --> 00:32:19,417
We have about 15 minutes

570
00:32:19,417 --> 00:32:19,417
But, if you want to come play

571
00:32:19,417 --> 00:32:19,417
stuff works, come

572
00:32:19,417 --> 00:32:20,417
we'll be there.

573
00:32:20,417 --> 00:32:22,292
If we e mail you, can we get

574
00:32:22,292 --> 00:32:22,292
The code

575
00:32:22,292 --> 00:32:24,876
and file distribution and posted

576
00:32:24,876 --> 00:32:26,999
What bit did you guys use

577
00:32:26,999 --> 00:32:28,834
The highest speed you could get.

578
00:32:28,834 --> 00:32:28,834
There was

579
00:32:28,834 --> 00:32:30,083
but you can also use small.

580
00:32:30,083 --> 00:32:31,083
3/64ths or less.
