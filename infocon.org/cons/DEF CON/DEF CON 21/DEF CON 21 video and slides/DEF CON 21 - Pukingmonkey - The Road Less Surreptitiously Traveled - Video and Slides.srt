1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,667
PUKINGMONKEY: I am "Pukingmonkey" and we are going

2
00:00:03,667 --> 00:00:07,584
to talk about how your car is tracked today.

3
00:00:11,709 --> 00:00:16,751
Originally I noticed license plate readers a few years ago.

4
00:00:22,876 --> 00:00:26,417
I didn't know what they were, then I did.

5
00:00:34,959 --> 00:00:39,876
I build a detector, so when my toll booth thing was "red"

6
00:00:39,876 --> 00:00:42,000
it notified me.

7
00:00:44,709 --> 00:00:48,667
Then I noticed other ways we are tracked with smart phones

8
00:00:48,667 --> 00:00:51,167
and even "dumb" phones.

9
00:00:56,334 --> 00:01:00,375
I tracked down, you have the right to travel.

10
00:01:17,876 --> 00:01:20,999
You have the right to travel anonymously.

11
00:01:20,999 --> 00:01:24,501
And, generally, it's yes, it's if you're driving,

12
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:27,626
because you have licensed.

13
00:01:27,709 --> 00:01:30,626
Taking a commercial flight, as we all know, to get here, or crossing

14
00:01:30,626 --> 00:01:32,667
an international border.

15
00:01:32,667 --> 00:01:35,083
Otherwise you do not need to have ID.

16
00:01:37,209 --> 00:01:40,083
License plate readers if you are not familiar

17
00:01:40,083 --> 00:01:43,999
with them basically are an OCRs on steroids.

18
00:01:44,667 --> 00:01:51,209
They use infrared and optical to find the license plate, do an OCR on it,

19
00:01:51,209 --> 00:01:57,667
track it where it's been found through GPS and coordinates.

20
00:01:57,876 --> 00:02:02,375
And if you get enough data points, they can track you whenever

21
00:02:02,375 --> 00:02:04,334
you've been.

22
00:02:06,667 --> 00:02:09,375
Here is some pictures of some New York City license

23
00:02:09,375 --> 00:02:11,083
plate readers.

24
00:02:11,083 --> 00:02:14,334
New York City tends to use a company called L Sag North America.

25
00:02:14,751 --> 00:02:21,584
You can see the back of the car, the one on the left is an older model,

26
00:02:21,584 --> 00:02:28,459
the one that's larger is a medium model, it's not the newest.

27
00:02:29,083 --> 00:02:34,125
You can see how they're mounted to aim toward license plates.

28
00:02:34,709 --> 00:02:38,459
And you can just see back on the back of it, this

29
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:43,417
is actually another jurisdiction, this is by federal PIPs system

30
00:02:43,417 --> 00:02:49,584
and you can see it's under the light bar, there are three of them, left, right,

31
00:02:49,584 --> 00:02:51,209
and side.

32
00:02:52,626 --> 00:02:56,292
And that's L Sag's newest model and if you look at most of these

33
00:02:56,292 --> 00:02:59,918
they look like they have get the other one.

34
00:02:59,999 --> 00:03:03,501
They look like they have this is the old model.

35
00:03:03,501 --> 00:03:05,417
Which has two cameras in it.

36
00:03:06,999 --> 00:03:12,542
There is a visible light and infrared light camera and April bank

37
00:03:12,542 --> 00:03:18,083
of infrared LEDs and on the back of it says "do not look at this"

38
00:03:18,083 --> 00:03:21,542
the infrared LED radiation.

39
00:03:21,542 --> 00:03:24,334
The new one ASP on the light bar and looks like it has

40
00:03:24,334 --> 00:03:29,959
a single camera so I haven't figured out if it's it's probably just IR.

41
00:03:32,709 --> 00:03:37,584
If you get it just right you can see on the back the nice, red glow

42
00:03:37,584 --> 00:03:41,834
of the infrared LEDs and they pulse say the.

43
00:03:42,167 --> 00:03:46,999
These are fixed cameras at 40 Wall Street the Trump building

44
00:03:46,999 --> 00:03:50,999
on Broadway and that's the same three cameras

45
00:03:50,999 --> 00:03:54,999
at night that you can see the glow.

46
00:03:58,584 --> 00:04:01,959
When I told people I found these cameras,

47
00:04:01,959 --> 00:04:07,918
they say "I see them everywhere and they're not" these are traffic control

48
00:04:07,918 --> 00:04:12,792
cameras, look for your car instead of the loop in the ground,

49
00:04:12,792 --> 00:04:15,417
to change the lights.

50
00:04:15,667 --> 00:04:23,250
These are not license plate readers, either, these are red light cameras,

51
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:30,083
what's the big deal with capturing the license plate information,

52
00:04:30,083 --> 00:04:36,501
they have time, location, and they keep it forever.

53
00:04:40,125 --> 00:04:44,999
New York City keeps it five years, Jersey keeps it five years,

54
00:04:44,999 --> 00:04:49,999
and I couldn't find data points for anything lower than 2009 where

55
00:04:49,999 --> 00:04:55,667
they had 108 fixed and 130 mobiles and I'm sure this number has not gone

56
00:04:55,667 --> 00:04:59,375
down and it's impossible to opt out.

57
00:04:59,375 --> 00:05:01,125
As you drive by you get read.

58
00:05:02,792 --> 00:05:05,250
So is it legal to do this tracking.

59
00:05:06,375 --> 00:05:10,999
Turns out it is, because there is no reasonable expectation

60
00:05:10,999 --> 00:05:15,999
of privacy of your license plate in public and these are the cases

61
00:05:15,999 --> 00:05:21,292
of why it is and people say, I heard that you can't GPS track my car

62
00:05:21,292 --> 00:05:24,209
without a warrant but that's different

63
00:05:24,209 --> 00:05:29,250
because the warrant was needed to put the GPS on the vehicle, not

64
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:31,999
to actually track it.

65
00:05:36,584 --> 00:05:38,999
And the other question was they said

66
00:05:38,999 --> 00:05:43,542
they couldn't use infrared technology to look into my house and that

67
00:05:43,542 --> 00:05:47,999
is true but those are constitutionally protected areas and your car

68
00:05:47,999 --> 00:05:52,999
on a public street is not a constitutionally protected area.

69
00:05:55,999 --> 00:05:59,125
So FEMA has been funding this to local police departments

70
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:03,083
for the last couple of years, 100% cost of the license plate readers

71
00:06:03,083 --> 00:06:05,751
has been coming from FEMA.

72
00:06:05,751 --> 00:06:10,667
This is a grant to Vermont for $6.6 million.

73
00:06:11,999 --> 00:06:15,918
This is the Vermont side of it saying, yes, we will use 100%

74
00:06:15,918 --> 00:06:20,083
of the proceedings from this to fund license plate readers and this

75
00:06:20,083 --> 00:06:22,876
is Burlington, Vermont, they purchased two

76
00:06:22,876 --> 00:06:26,999
for I know you can't read it, for $45,000 for two.

77
00:06:29,501 --> 00:06:33,542
So the retention data New Hampshire has a general ban on this, people

78
00:06:33,542 --> 00:06:36,999
of New Hampshire said no, which is great.

79
00:06:36,999 --> 00:06:40,792
I hear they're trying to ban them in Montana, working on that.

80
00:06:40,834 --> 00:06:42,250
Maine has a lot of these.

81
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:44,999
You cannot store this data for more than 21 days in Maine

82
00:06:44,999 --> 00:06:48,209
if there is no criminal investigation.

83
00:06:48,209 --> 00:06:51,167
In New Jersey they must retain all data for five years and

84
00:06:51,167 --> 00:06:54,626
after five years it must be destroyed.

85
00:06:54,876 --> 00:06:57,999
Not sure how that works, I guess they don't have back ups.

86
00:06:59,999 --> 00:07:03,083
New York City retains it for five years even though

87
00:07:03,083 --> 00:07:06,999
they have video cam remarks video feeds, after 21 days if there

88
00:07:06,999 --> 00:07:09,999
is no crime involved in a video feed they claim

89
00:07:09,999 --> 00:07:12,584
they destroy the videos but they will keep

90
00:07:12,584 --> 00:07:15,999
the license plate data for five years.

91
00:07:17,083 --> 00:07:20,999
Now they have this data, and it's actually public data.

92
00:07:21,209 --> 00:07:25,209
Minneapolis released the data to the public and recant and I'll show

93
00:07:25,209 --> 00:07:27,083
you that later.

94
00:07:27,375 --> 00:07:29,999
It can be discoverable because it's data about you.

95
00:07:29,999 --> 00:07:32,751
Generally if there is an investigation about you,

96
00:07:32,751 --> 00:07:35,834
you can ask to see what the police have on you,

97
00:07:35,834 --> 00:07:39,999
in New York it's called "Rosario" and it's statement by them, and

98
00:07:39,999 --> 00:07:43,834
the police department has claimed this is not a statement

99
00:07:43,834 --> 00:07:47,417
but you cannot use it to discover it so they're using it

100
00:07:47,417 --> 00:07:51,417
investigate you but it's not a statement so you do not get it

101
00:07:51,417 --> 00:07:55,999
from them to see what they are investigating about you.

102
00:08:00,542 --> 00:08:06,334
And Minneapolis, the first column is the license plate number and the text,

103
00:08:06,334 --> 00:08:11,667
the time and the GPS coordinates with a picture of the license plate

104
00:08:11,667 --> 00:08:14,501
and the back of the car.

105
00:08:15,999 --> 00:08:18,918
They have fixed ones, too, and this is how they redacted it so you cannot

106
00:08:18,918 --> 00:08:21,876
find where their fixed license plate readers were.

107
00:08:22,375 --> 00:08:26,876
You can just look for them.

108
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:31,125
It may not matter if there is retention or not because there

109
00:08:31,125 --> 00:08:36,876
is a commercial market for this there is a company F company called Vigilant

110
00:08:36,876 --> 00:08:41,999
Solutions and their sole customer is law enforcement and tow operators

111
00:08:41,999 --> 00:08:46,999
use this to find cars to be repo 'ed and law enforcement will buy it

112
00:08:46,999 --> 00:08:51,999
whether they have it retained or not and you can buy it from TLO.com

113
00:08:51,999 --> 00:08:55,999
for $10 a pop and you put in a license plate number and

114
00:08:55,999 --> 00:09:00,083
they will tell you where it has been seen.

115
00:09:00,584 --> 00:09:04,125
They say they have 1 pill I don't know data points, TLO.

116
00:09:05,459 --> 00:09:12,501
This is not law enforcement, this is one of the cars from Vigilant and

117
00:09:12,501 --> 00:09:19,417
they have their own license plate reader and it's infrared.

118
00:09:24,459 --> 00:09:27,626
I went about building my own and it's hard to avoid them

119
00:09:27,626 --> 00:09:30,959
because there is a lot of them, but at least you know there

120
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:33,584
and because they're always on.

121
00:09:35,501 --> 00:09:41,083
I had a lot of failures, full sunlight, I have my detector,

122
00:09:41,083 --> 00:09:47,083
I'm detecting my remote control from 80 feet and I can't detect

123
00:09:47,083 --> 00:09:51,375
the reader but I had to use optical filters,

124
00:09:51,375 --> 00:09:58,334
the LEDs they're using are not standard that you find in remote controls,

125
00:09:58,334 --> 00:10:04,626
they're near IR, 755 nanometers, and the filter blocks everything

126
00:10:04,626 --> 00:10:09,999
below 720 nano meters and you can see it glows but there

127
00:10:09,999 --> 00:10:17,042
is ambient IR there and I got another filter that was 30 and you can see it

128
00:10:17,042 --> 00:10:22,000
shines right through so I use that to do it and this

129
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,083
is why I'll describe this graph.

130
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:29,999
The magenta is the standard infrared detector that

131
00:10:29,999 --> 00:10:36,501
you would find in commercial stuff, the bright red is the wave length

132
00:10:36,501 --> 00:10:40,751
of where the L Sag North America you can see

133
00:10:40,751 --> 00:10:46,626
I put up where the visible was and it's just above the red and

134
00:10:46,626 --> 00:10:52,167
the green is the filter and the black line is the detection

135
00:10:52,167 --> 00:10:58,999
of I bought a wide range photo diode, and the detector looks like this,

136
00:10:58,999 --> 00:11:03,959
and I will be at the hardware hacking village today

137
00:11:03,959 --> 00:11:08,125
and go over the full specs of this.

138
00:11:09,667 --> 00:11:13,459
That's the detector with the filter on it.

139
00:11:13,459 --> 00:11:20,334
I super glued it on to it and put it into the little old DSL splitter case,

140
00:11:20,334 --> 00:11:26,417
put LEDs on it and this is the proof of concept.

141
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:29,292
(Noise!

142
00:11:38,999 --> 00:11:42,959
)    (Away from microphone.) Actually what it's

143
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:46,542
doing in the IR is not pulsating it's ramping

144
00:11:46,542 --> 00:11:50,626
up from zero to full because they're trying to get

145
00:11:50,626 --> 00:11:54,083
the best exposure of the plate.

146
00:11:54,626 --> 00:12:02,167
It look to us like it ends up looking like a 3 Hertz frequency on it.

147
00:12:02,626 --> 00:12:06,083
So eventually it turned into this, because I tried

148
00:12:06,083 --> 00:12:11,999
to prevent false positives so anything between 3 and 9 Hertz will set it

149
00:12:11,999 --> 00:12:16,667
off and I use the monkey to tell me I got red and these are

150
00:12:16,667 --> 00:12:21,751
the same 3 and you can see in the next video where it is, there

151
00:12:21,751 --> 00:12:27,459
is a TGIF's on the right and scaffolding and it's right before the light

152
00:12:27,459 --> 00:12:32,667
but you get red near the TGIF's because it's angled.

153
00:12:35,417 --> 00:12:44,999
(Noise) There is the scaffolding on the right and the monkey screams!

154
00:12:45,501 --> 00:12:50,876
(Laughter.) (Applause.) Is there anything you can do

155
00:12:50,876 --> 00:12:55,459
about your license plate being read?

156
00:12:55,792 --> 00:12:57,584
There are things you can.

157
00:12:57,584 --> 00:13:00,167
Steve Jobs never had plates on his car.

158
00:13:00,876 --> 00:13:03,167
California had a law that you did not have

159
00:13:03,167 --> 00:13:06,999
to have a plate for six months, that's now been changed to 90 days

160
00:13:06,999 --> 00:13:10,584
but he got the same car over and over so he got a new car and

161
00:13:10,584 --> 00:13:13,959
he never had plates so if you have enough money you don't

162
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:16,334
need plates in California.

163
00:13:16,999 --> 00:13:19,709
So maybe will he will he can help us, these are

164
00:13:19,709 --> 00:13:23,709
the guys that are running these devices and I found personal vehicles

165
00:13:23,709 --> 00:13:27,959
of police I blocked their license plate numbers not for their protection

166
00:13:27,959 --> 00:13:29,667
but for mine.

167
00:13:31,999 --> 00:13:35,125
This guy most of them are near police stations and

168
00:13:35,125 --> 00:13:39,459
they usually have tinted windows, they usually don't have inspection

169
00:13:39,459 --> 00:13:43,792
stickers, parked illegally, so they're easy to find.

170
00:13:43,792 --> 00:13:46,959
This guy doesn't have front plates he has a cover

171
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:52,083
on his license plate that's dark, another illegal thing and you can see

172
00:13:52,083 --> 00:13:57,209
all except his windshield he has a PBA shield in his windshield that

173
00:13:57,209 --> 00:14:01,375
is not although indicative of a cop put this guy is and

174
00:14:01,375 --> 00:14:04,959
the windows are illegally tinted.

175
00:14:05,999 --> 00:14:10,584
This guy has the things that shift on the back and I know he's

176
00:14:10,584 --> 00:14:15,125
a cop because he's tinted up and parked in an MTA police only,

177
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:18,584
otherwise he has a lot of balls!

178
00:14:20,209 --> 00:14:23,083
(Laughter.) This is the front and back.

179
00:14:24,083 --> 00:14:26,209
You can never get the full license plate number you would

180
00:14:26,209 --> 00:14:28,125
have to put it together.

181
00:14:29,667 --> 00:14:33,375
This guy is tinted, no front plate, back is there and I know it's

182
00:14:33,375 --> 00:14:36,999
a cop because he's standing next to the car.

183
00:14:36,999 --> 00:14:42,083
(Laughter.) I like this one.

184
00:14:42,125 --> 00:14:44,999
You can see the police car in the background but I only

185
00:14:44,999 --> 00:14:48,542
like this because he didn't care about his front plate he cared

186
00:14:48,542 --> 00:14:51,959
about the back more and he has "EFF" plates, I don't think

187
00:14:51,959 --> 00:14:54,083
he knows what that is!

188
00:14:56,083 --> 00:14:58,834
(Chuckles.) This was a uniformed officer making

189
00:14:58,834 --> 00:15:02,542
a right turn I captured and he's driving with his tail gate down and

190
00:15:02,542 --> 00:15:04,959
he has a piece of wood preventing whatever

191
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:08,999
is in the back from rolling out, and he has stickers that says New Jersey

192
00:15:08,999 --> 00:15:12,918
state police and "hero" and I find out that's common.

193
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:22,083
You can see him standing near the car in the top photo,

194
00:15:22,083 --> 00:15:25,584
he has occasion (Cutting out.

195
00:15:25,584 --> 00:15:29,584
) Front plate and even his windshield is tinted black.

196
00:15:32,417 --> 00:15:35,626
He has his tail gate down, too, so you can't read it.

197
00:15:35,751 --> 00:15:38,417
Maybe he's just parked there because the other guy was driving,

198
00:15:38,417 --> 00:15:41,167
this guy was parked, maybe he's getting something out,

199
00:15:41,167 --> 00:15:45,792
few days later, I found it different spot, tail gate down, same car.

200
00:15:46,501 --> 00:15:51,334
Another one, it's illegally parked completely black no

201
00:15:51,334 --> 00:15:57,751
inspection sticker, no front plate and he, as well, has a darker cover

202
00:15:57,751 --> 00:16:00,250
on his back plate.

203
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:01,999
This was the one that scared me

204
00:16:01,999 --> 00:16:04,667
because he came out as I was taking the picture and

205
00:16:04,667 --> 00:16:06,083
he said "what are you doing?"

206
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:09,083
And I said "this car is absolutely beautiful I love it!"

207
00:16:09,083 --> 00:16:12,876
I'm glad it was a nice car and not a piece of crap!

208
00:16:14,459 --> 00:16:19,834
Thin blue line, front plate, completely black ended windows,

209
00:16:19,834 --> 00:16:23,709
windshield, and PBA license plates and (Away

210
00:16:23,709 --> 00:16:29,751
from microphone.) has a black shield over the back plate.

211
00:16:30,083 --> 00:16:33,709
What these cops do is typical, what I just said but you can't do any

212
00:16:33,709 --> 00:16:37,959
of this, this will get you pulled over in most jurisdictions.

213
00:16:37,959 --> 00:16:40,999
They can do it because no cop is going to give them a ticket,

214
00:16:40,999 --> 00:16:44,125
they're going to get professional courtesy.

215
00:16:45,751 --> 00:16:47,959
You can try and do temp tags but you run

216
00:16:47,959 --> 00:16:51,999
out of time and they're not always great because New York temp tags are not

217
00:16:51,999 --> 00:16:54,542
good in Massachusetts, they will impound your car

218
00:16:54,542 --> 00:16:58,999
as unregistered and uninsured, and then you have to tow it home.

219
00:17:01,918 --> 00:17:08,999
They tend the registrations tend to be one use numbers.

220
00:17:09,167 --> 00:17:12,209
I ran across these temp tags, I have no idea they have

221
00:17:12,209 --> 00:17:15,375
an expiration date there is no number and it seems to be

222
00:17:15,375 --> 00:17:17,209
from a company.

223
00:17:17,334 --> 00:17:20,459
Or maybe they just don't care.

224
00:17:20,999 --> 00:17:24,959
Or maybe it's Georgia doesn't care, because it's

225
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:32,375
from Georgia so you get 90 days and most people can't go through there.

226
00:17:33,667 --> 00:17:36,584
You can get commercial plates so they aren't registered

227
00:17:36,584 --> 00:17:39,292
to you and there are problems with commercial plates

228
00:17:39,292 --> 00:17:41,709
because in New York commercial vehicles have

229
00:17:41,709 --> 00:17:45,417
a different rule set than vehicles and you can see, police check point,

230
00:17:45,417 --> 00:17:49,125
all commercial vehicles must stop and they look inside each struck this

231
00:17:49,125 --> 00:17:51,959
is not just to check documents.

232
00:17:54,584 --> 00:17:57,959
Since it's not usually theirs, they comply, sure you want to look

233
00:17:57,959 --> 00:18:02,250
in the back of my truck, go ahead, they want to get their job done.

234
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:05,999
The other things that are hard for the LPR,

235
00:18:05,999 --> 00:18:09,083
North Carolina took a bunch of plates and ran 'em

236
00:18:09,083 --> 00:18:13,125
through to see what LPRs had difficulty reading.

237
00:18:13,167 --> 00:18:16,834
If you have a nonreflective plate it's invisible

238
00:18:16,834 --> 00:18:20,999
at night and it's difficult during the day.

239
00:18:21,292 --> 00:18:23,999
Nonrefrequent active plates are uncommon now.

240
00:18:24,834 --> 00:18:28,417
If you decide you can remove the reflectivity but it's a crime

241
00:18:28,417 --> 00:18:31,999
in California to do this and if you're in Massachusetts you

242
00:18:31,999 --> 00:18:36,999
will fail inspection and you have to get a new plate and go through.

243
00:18:36,999 --> 00:18:40,999
Low contrast plates, the color of the letter is close to the color

244
00:18:40,999 --> 00:18:43,751
of the background, red characters it tends

245
00:18:43,751 --> 00:18:47,501
to have trouble with and if you have three or more stacked

246
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:51,999
characters because they tend to be small it tends to miss those and

247
00:18:51,999 --> 00:18:56,417
if you put registration stickers like Missouri I think puts it right

248
00:18:56,417 --> 00:19:00,209
in the middle of the plate near the letters and that tends

249
00:19:00,209 --> 00:19:04,751
to screw it up, too, so they have trouble with that.

250
00:19:05,083 --> 00:19:08,626
8 digits or more, narrow letters are not great and great

251
00:19:08,626 --> 00:19:12,834
if you have a front plate, only read half the time.

252
00:19:13,334 --> 00:19:17,209
These are the states that have the greens are

253
00:19:17,209 --> 00:19:22,792
the states that have one plate, red will have Nevada is special

254
00:19:22,792 --> 00:19:27,250
because they have there are rules for it.

255
00:19:29,792 --> 00:19:34,292
And these are the states with legal, nonreflective plates that are still valid,

256
00:19:34,292 --> 00:19:36,083
not very many.

257
00:19:37,709 --> 00:19:42,125
You can try manufacturer plates but this is the date

258
00:19:42,125 --> 00:19:48,667
of the youngest car you can have, for California it's you would only going

259
00:19:48,667 --> 00:19:52,999
to 1962, so that doesn't work, either.

260
00:19:53,999 --> 00:19:56,999
See a lot of obscure plates, people using

261
00:19:56,999 --> 00:20:00,999
whether they're doing this on purpose or not is unknown

262
00:20:00,999 --> 00:20:04,125
to me but this causes problems.

263
00:20:04,125 --> 00:20:08,000
You get salt spreaders, plows, monkeys, tail gates,

264
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:15,167
I'm not sure what the front of one of those is but the bicycle things make

265
00:20:15,167 --> 00:20:20,542
it impossible to get a read but these are all these can

266
00:20:20,542 --> 00:20:26,501
all get you a citation, they tend to be not moving violations,

267
00:20:26,501 --> 00:20:32,834
obscure plates, it's a $100 fine, no court appearance, you pay it

268
00:20:32,834 --> 00:20:34,999
and move on.

269
00:20:34,999 --> 00:20:38,334
Or you can get some plates that is not your number.

270
00:20:38,501 --> 00:20:40,709
This is the University of Michigan plates

271
00:20:40,709 --> 00:20:43,999
but the it leading "M" on both of those is not part

272
00:20:43,999 --> 00:20:46,834
of the registration number.

273
00:20:47,834 --> 00:20:50,501
They can still get you because they have a full number, it

274
00:20:50,501 --> 00:20:52,999
will be figured out eventually.

275
00:20:52,999 --> 00:20:54,792
You can do bumper guards if you're parked

276
00:20:54,792 --> 00:20:57,375
because they read 'em when you're parked they ride

277
00:20:57,375 --> 00:21:00,250
down the street reading the plates.

278
00:21:02,375 --> 00:21:05,999
More bumper guards but don't drive I have seen people

279
00:21:05,999 --> 00:21:08,999
driving down the road with that covered, and

280
00:21:08,999 --> 00:21:12,417
the other worry is if you have no plates on your car,

281
00:21:12,417 --> 00:21:18,542
every jurisdiction no plates cars are abandoned and subject to confiscation.

282
00:21:21,083 --> 00:21:23,167
You can legally if you have Easy Pass

283
00:21:23,167 --> 00:21:27,083
in your jurisdiction you can usually legally obscure your front plate

284
00:21:27,083 --> 00:21:30,876
and there is a law for it and there is one exception and that's

285
00:21:30,876 --> 00:21:33,626
for the external EZ Pass reader.

286
00:21:40,999 --> 00:21:43,918
Don't do this, these are government documents

287
00:21:43,918 --> 00:21:47,292
and you will be charged with tampering.

288
00:21:48,375 --> 00:21:55,542
So I built a camera to see what the license plate readers are seeing

289
00:21:55,542 --> 00:22:01,375
but most commercial infrared cameras are 850 so I bought

290
00:22:01,375 --> 00:22:07,501
the 750 nanometers LEDs to see what shows up with that and

291
00:22:07,501 --> 00:22:13,751
the 735 LEDs, the 420 guys like this for grow lights so I'm

292
00:22:13,751 --> 00:22:17,542
on some other list now too!

293
00:22:24,626 --> 00:22:28,999
(Laughter.) You can buy these things that say "hey,

294
00:22:28,999 --> 00:22:34,626
no red light camera" put this on the back, it's clear, it blocks

295
00:22:34,626 --> 00:22:39,459
above 850 nano meters but since the license plate reader

296
00:22:39,459 --> 00:22:45,083
is below that, the first one it's regular, this is the middle one

297
00:22:45,083 --> 00:22:49,334
is with the 730 and if it's 850, these kinda work

298
00:22:49,334 --> 00:22:52,876
but they're illegal as well.

299
00:22:52,876 --> 00:22:55,626
You can see what they do on other plates.

300
00:23:00,083 --> 00:23:04,999
I ran across this by accident using the camera on plates

301
00:23:04,999 --> 00:23:10,834
during the wintertime since I'm from a place that salts their roads

302
00:23:10,834 --> 00:23:16,999
and this is a license plate with a whole bunch of salt on it.

303
00:23:17,501 --> 00:23:20,584
Visually it doesn't look too much different on the top, this

304
00:23:20,584 --> 00:23:23,751
is with the flash and that's with the IR.

305
00:23:25,375 --> 00:23:27,792
That's a moderate amount of salt because it looks

306
00:23:27,792 --> 00:23:30,999
like the salt absorbs enough of the IR to make it unreadable and that's

307
00:23:30,999 --> 00:23:32,999
with "a lot" of salt.

308
00:23:34,083 --> 00:23:42,167
I don't want to go through those.

309
00:23:42,167 --> 00:23:45,792
You can get these are states that have stacked characters, you want

310
00:23:45,792 --> 00:23:48,709
the one like New York that has NYPD makes it

311
00:23:48,709 --> 00:23:51,999
difficult to read, the Jerseys once aren't great,

312
00:23:51,999 --> 00:23:53,999
easy to detect.

313
00:23:54,125 --> 00:23:57,375
You can get special characters that are hearts and ampersands,

314
00:23:57,375 --> 00:24:01,209
and they're sometimes IPR'd, and some states have those.

315
00:24:08,375 --> 00:24:13,834
You can change your plates as much as possible so it won't avoid detections

316
00:24:13,834 --> 00:24:17,709
and you won't have that big of a history.

317
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:22,999
In Florida it's country by country but one

318
00:24:22,999 --> 00:24:27,542
of them I think it was Mississippi it's $1.25, you can change your plates

319
00:24:27,542 --> 00:24:29,751
every day at lunch.

320
00:24:29,834 --> 00:24:34,250
(Laughter.) If it weren't for the DMV taking four hours.

321
00:24:36,125 --> 00:24:38,501
Manufacture them are reasonably priced.

322
00:24:40,792 --> 00:24:44,375
These are the states with the eight character plates,

323
00:24:44,375 --> 00:24:49,292
not very much and that's it for the license plate reader.

324
00:24:49,292 --> 00:24:55,167
Then I moved on to the EZ Pass, electronic toll collection tags,

325
00:24:55,167 --> 00:25:00,959
most people forget they're in the windshield and it's

326
00:25:00,959 --> 00:25:07,584
at 915 megahertz and most of them don't have batteries anymore,

327
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:14,209
I took mine apart, has a nice battery, has a switch and figured

328
00:25:14,209 --> 00:25:20,083
out the current draw of when it was being read and not,

329
00:25:20,083 --> 00:25:25,834
you shouldn't do this because it's not your property,

330
00:25:25,834 --> 00:25:33,542
you have to return these and I basically built a low side voltage detects

331
00:25:33,542 --> 00:25:41,834
and when it went off it would setoff the timer and make the cow moo.

332
00:25:43,876 --> 00:25:46,999
The circuit integrated into it, put an on and off switch

333
00:25:46,999 --> 00:25:50,083
on it so I can turn it off while I'm driving and drove

334
00:25:50,083 --> 00:25:53,083
around and found where it got read.

335
00:25:54,083 --> 00:25:57,667
This place, there is no tolls here, but it would go

336
00:25:57,667 --> 00:26:01,792
off underneath the sign so I stopped on the side of the road

337
00:26:01,792 --> 00:26:05,083
and looked backwards and it may not be on purposes

338
00:26:05,083 --> 00:26:11,083
but you can sigh there are two readers behind the sign, white boxes there.

339
00:26:12,999 --> 00:26:15,959
These aren't hidden, they're just out there.

340
00:26:17,083 --> 00:26:18,999
This is the access to the Lincoln Tunnel

341
00:26:18,999 --> 00:26:21,083
from the Jersey side.

342
00:26:21,083 --> 00:26:23,999
If you're up top, you're committed to going through the tunnel to pay

343
00:26:23,999 --> 00:26:26,584
the toll, and there are three here and you can see

344
00:26:26,584 --> 00:26:30,999
the one that reads you but it's not going to charge you the toll.

345
00:26:30,999 --> 00:26:32,999
You will get charged the toll at the toll and you will get read

346
00:26:32,999 --> 00:26:35,083
at the entrance of the tunnel.

347
00:26:35,334 --> 00:26:39,999
And they want to know, because this is the last exit, there is one

348
00:26:39,999 --> 00:26:45,751
at the exit for the last exit in Jersey, so it's being watched.

349
00:26:46,083 --> 00:26:47,999
You drive around New York City and you

350
00:26:47,999 --> 00:26:50,501
will see them hanging from lights.

351
00:26:53,083 --> 00:26:58,459
And I made it easy to see, another one.

352
00:26:58,459 --> 00:27:00,375
I got tired of taking pictures of them.

353
00:27:00,999 --> 00:27:04,999
These are from a company called Trans Core.

354
00:27:05,083 --> 00:27:08,209
They can read all the protocols including EZ Pass

355
00:27:08,209 --> 00:27:12,167
which was a closed protocol until a few months ago and

356
00:27:12,167 --> 00:27:16,876
they had it reversed engineered, and it will read the Sun Pass

357
00:27:16,876 --> 00:27:20,584
from Florida and that's why New York City likes it,

358
00:27:20,584 --> 00:27:22,999
they get everybody.

359
00:27:24,709 --> 00:27:31,709
I didn't like I had to be detected, it was like a ping, so for me to find

360
00:27:31,709 --> 00:27:36,918
out if I was being read I had to give my position away

361
00:27:36,918 --> 00:27:41,542
as well so I got a 915 megahertz radio and put it

362
00:27:41,542 --> 00:27:46,876
in a tin with a little meter on it and we'll do a proof

363
00:27:46,876 --> 00:27:53,375
of concept here, the Adrena One is in the cow on the left and the one

364
00:27:53,375 --> 00:27:56,417
on the right I built.

365
00:27:56,417 --> 00:27:57,417
(Noise.

366
00:27:59,999 --> 00:28:12,667
) (Cow mooing.) And right under the sign, as predicted, it gets red.

367
00:28:15,667 --> 00:28:22,375
We will go through the Holland Tunnel again,

368
00:28:22,375 --> 00:28:33,167
maybe we will do that again, to show an EZ Pass works just fine.

369
00:28:43,417 --> 00:28:46,292
(Applause.) On the first one I showed you I circled

370
00:28:46,292 --> 00:28:50,459
the tag and the cow on the bottom is already going off.

371
00:28:52,083 --> 00:28:56,292
I did a rundown 7th avenue from 44th Street Time Square area

372
00:28:56,292 --> 00:29:01,959
to Madison Square garden and you will see how often it gets read.

373
00:29:02,459 --> 00:29:04,292
It's going already.

374
00:29:07,459 --> 00:29:09,918
It moos only a couple of times but as long as the nose

375
00:29:09,918 --> 00:29:11,876
is on it's being read.

376
00:29:12,626 --> 00:29:20,250
This is a 5 minute journey, so it's being sped up.

377
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:22,083
Still on.

378
00:29:45,792 --> 00:29:50,083
(Mooing, mooing, mooing) (More mooing!

379
00:29:50,083 --> 00:29:55,999
) I'm in traffic.

380
00:30:01,125 --> 00:30:10,876
(Mooing, mooing) (Mooing, mooing) (Mooing, mooing,

381
00:30:10,876 --> 00:30:22,959
mooing) It goes off as soon as you pass 31st street and remains

382
00:30:22,959 --> 00:30:36,209
off until the Lincoln Tunnel, which is not a toll, and this is exiting

383
00:30:36,209 --> 00:30:44,334
from Manhattan at the Lincoln Tunnel.

384
00:30:44,334 --> 00:30:48,918
(Mooing, mooing, mooing) The New York state

385
00:30:48,918 --> 00:30:53,209
Department of Transportation admits

386
00:30:53,209 --> 00:30:59,626
they do read your easy pass but I didn't expect it

387
00:30:59,626 --> 00:31:03,334
at every intersection.

388
00:31:05,334 --> 00:31:08,542
They say they do this for travel times.

389
00:31:08,542 --> 00:31:11,459
I have never seen travel times in the middle of Manhattan!

390
00:31:13,250 --> 00:31:15,918
(Chuckles.) What do they do with this data?

391
00:31:16,292 --> 00:31:20,667
Do they retain it give it to the NSA, the "New York Times" said they did!

392
00:31:24,999 --> 00:31:28,999
(Chuckles.) This is easy, if you have these things you put it

393
00:31:28,999 --> 00:31:33,709
in the antistatic thing they gave you, it can't be read or if you have

394
00:31:33,709 --> 00:31:36,959
a sticker you're going to have to build the cage

395
00:31:36,959 --> 00:31:40,709
around and it I got that idea from the car rental company

396
00:31:40,709 --> 00:31:43,999
they have these fold down things so you can pop it

397
00:31:43,999 --> 00:31:47,918
up and it won't be read, but if you do that, it gets read

398
00:31:47,918 --> 00:31:52,667
before the toll, at the toll and after the toll so if you're doing that,

399
00:31:52,667 --> 00:31:56,167
you're not showing up at these other places you may be

400
00:31:56,167 --> 00:31:58,667
a person of interest.

401
00:31:58,876 --> 00:32:01,167
If you're only seen at the toll.

402
00:32:02,125 --> 00:32:06,083
Then we come to your tires.

403
00:32:06,626 --> 00:32:12,584
Back in 2000 Firestone had a strike and replacement workers made their

404
00:32:12,584 --> 00:32:16,334
tires and they tended to blow up.

405
00:32:17,083 --> 00:32:22,167
Something got passed called "Tread" and they wanted toe track who made

406
00:32:22,167 --> 00:32:25,334
the tires because there was never any there

407
00:32:25,334 --> 00:32:29,250
is no serial number on tires, they're molded, the mold

408
00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:33,999
from 10 years ago is the same as today so you can't tell when it

409
00:32:33,999 --> 00:32:35,626
got made.

410
00:32:35,999 --> 00:32:39,918
So there are a couple of things in your wheels.

411
00:32:39,918 --> 00:32:42,584
First one is the tire pressure monitoring system that's not

412
00:32:42,584 --> 00:32:47,667
in the tire that's part of your rim on the backside of the valve stem.

413
00:32:47,999 --> 00:32:53,250
This transmits at 315 megahertz and it's unique per rim.

414
00:32:53,918 --> 00:32:57,459
This is not so bad because to get your ID somebody has

415
00:32:57,459 --> 00:33:01,999
to some to your car and get the ID, but they could.

416
00:33:02,876 --> 00:33:07,417
Then the tire manufacturers are putting RIFDs in the sidewalls themselves.

417
00:33:07,918 --> 00:33:13,918
There is a unique serial number in each, Michelin uses 915 megahertz,

418
00:33:13,918 --> 00:33:19,999
Good Year could not get that to work, if you get your tires from Ford,

419
00:33:19,999 --> 00:33:24,417
Chrysler, they put the VIN number in the tire so now

420
00:33:24,417 --> 00:33:28,334
the VIN number that goes to your state I know

421
00:33:28,334 --> 00:33:33,584
of no one that's doing it but if I were somebody that wanted

422
00:33:33,584 --> 00:33:38,999
to track I would be putting sensors at sides of roads and this

423
00:33:38,999 --> 00:33:43,083
is a tire pressure monitoring system.

424
00:33:43,083 --> 00:33:46,584
This was a picture showing a run flat tire and you can see where

425
00:33:46,584 --> 00:33:49,999
they cut away the run flat it's a transmitter, it's

426
00:33:49,999 --> 00:33:54,250
like the EZ Pass, has a circuitry, battery in it.

427
00:33:59,125 --> 00:34:01,834
You can't take your tires off and put them back

428
00:34:01,834 --> 00:34:04,375
on yourself you need somebody else to do that and

429
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:07,375
if you disable your tire pressure monitoring system you

430
00:34:07,375 --> 00:34:09,751
will have that light on the your dashboard

431
00:34:09,751 --> 00:34:13,417
the entire time and if you have an automobile inspection you probably

432
00:34:13,417 --> 00:34:16,999
won't pass it because in Jersey if you have an indicator light on,

433
00:34:16,999 --> 00:34:20,876
check engine, low tire pressure, seat belt indicator does not work you

434
00:34:20,876 --> 00:34:23,083
will not pass inspection.

435
00:34:24,542 --> 00:34:27,125
You might want to try and jam it.

436
00:34:27,959 --> 00:34:31,751
I was unsuccessful at doing that, that's for later.

437
00:34:31,876 --> 00:34:34,083
You can try an EMP pulse that maybe the chip

438
00:34:34,083 --> 00:34:39,083
is in the sidewall of the tires but rubber absorbs RF very well.

439
00:34:40,751 --> 00:34:44,751
There are other RFD things around, parking passes, hang tags,

440
00:34:44,751 --> 00:34:48,375
you can get a radio to see if that's what happens if it's

441
00:34:48,375 --> 00:34:53,959
a hang tag and something opens a gate for you it's probably an RFID.

442
00:34:53,999 --> 00:34:57,083
There is a community that used their parking permits

443
00:34:57,083 --> 00:35:01,250
because they had so much counter fit parking stickers for the street

444
00:35:01,250 --> 00:35:05,209
they put RFIDs in them and put them on the cars you want to park

445
00:35:05,209 --> 00:35:08,918
on the street you're going to be detected, too, it's tough

446
00:35:08,918 --> 00:35:10,999
to get around it.

447
00:35:10,999 --> 00:35:14,999
Italy is doing this and Texas was going to put them in their inspection stickers

448
00:35:14,999 --> 00:35:17,999
but I don't know if that passed.

449
00:35:17,999 --> 00:35:21,417
So you need to not use those if you can.

450
00:35:23,751 --> 00:35:27,834
I came across a company called Inrix and they collect position data

451
00:35:27,834 --> 00:35:30,209
from 100 million devices.

452
00:35:30,209 --> 00:35:32,999
Google maps uses them for their traffic flow, six

453
00:35:32,999 --> 00:35:37,999
of the auto manufacturers with built in nav uses Inrix, 8 out of 12

454
00:35:37,999 --> 00:35:42,584
in the top navigation apps in the iStore use these people, and

455
00:35:42,584 --> 00:35:45,292
they track dumb phones with contracts

456
00:35:45,292 --> 00:35:48,584
with the cell phone companies.

457
00:35:48,584 --> 00:35:51,999
And they originally started by tracking commercial truck fleets.

458
00:35:51,999 --> 00:35:54,626
So they have lots of data on you.

459
00:35:54,626 --> 00:35:56,999
If you use any of these apps, you've giving it to them and

460
00:35:56,999 --> 00:35:59,083
they know who you are.

461
00:35:59,209 --> 00:36:03,999
So at the end of the day, you need to assault your plate, bag your tag,

462
00:36:03,999 --> 00:36:08,417
jam your tires, turn off all electronic devices.

463
00:36:08,417 --> 00:36:09,999
And that's it!

464
00:36:17,834 --> 00:36:21,501
(Applause.) I will take questions if you have them.

465
00:36:21,501 --> 00:36:24,667
AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Away from microphone.)    Lighting

466
00:36:24,667 --> 00:36:28,999
the back of the car with LEDs you can do that to block it,

467
00:36:28,999 --> 00:36:33,876
you're going to need both of them but many states have if you jam

468
00:36:33,876 --> 00:36:38,167
a red light camera you have committed a crime.

469
00:36:38,167 --> 00:36:41,083
AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Away from microphone.)    The back

470
00:36:41,083 --> 00:36:44,751
of the lights, no, it's usually open worded saying

471
00:36:44,751 --> 00:36:48,542
if you can defeat a red light camera any means any way

472
00:36:48,542 --> 00:36:51,417
you have committed a crime.

473
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:57,709
So they're illegal and if I was the LPR guys and you think you have IR

474
00:36:57,709 --> 00:37:01,292
and you used 850, if I was L Sag I would put

475
00:37:01,292 --> 00:37:05,709
the same blocker you put on your plate to block that

476
00:37:05,709 --> 00:37:10,999
and I won't see your LEDs because 740s are uncommon.

477
00:37:19,083 --> 00:37:20,999
Wait, it's coming.

478
00:37:22,083 --> 00:37:27,918
AUDIENCE MEMBER: You stated the toll collection is shared with NSA.

479
00:37:27,918 --> 00:37:29,334
Does that apply to LPRs?

480
00:37:29,334 --> 00:37:31,751
I don't know that.

481
00:37:31,751 --> 00:37:36,792
The only reason I know it was shared is because "New York Times" said

482
00:37:36,792 --> 00:37:40,999
in one of the articles written after Snowden that

483
00:37:40,999 --> 00:37:45,918
they get EZ Pass data, most people think it's at the tows,

484
00:37:45,918 --> 00:37:51,999
big deal, but it's much more than that, but it tend to be government data

485
00:37:51,999 --> 00:37:55,501
and since FEMA is fund it's part of their

486
00:37:55,501 --> 00:37:59,792
for this money we want your data, too.

487
00:37:59,999 --> 00:38:03,417
I have no documents saying that.

488
00:38:03,417 --> 00:38:06,125
AUDIENCE MEMBER: How about Frisnel lenses

489
00:38:06,125 --> 00:38:11,667
or dust covers    PUKINGMONKEY: All these things every jurisdiction has

490
00:38:11,667 --> 00:38:16,292
an obscure plate law so if you obscure your plate    AUDIENCE

491
00:38:16,292 --> 00:38:18,999
MEMBER: (Away from microphone.)

492
00:38:18,999 --> 00:38:23,375
PUKINGMONKEY: To depends on the jurisdiction.

493
00:38:23,375 --> 00:38:27,334
Most of 'em like if the red light camera can't get one of them is Pennsylvania,

494
00:38:27,334 --> 00:38:31,417
that's the one I knew well because basically it's broad: Anything

495
00:38:31,417 --> 00:38:35,375
you do to defeat a red light camera is illegal.

496
00:38:35,375 --> 00:38:38,626
It's a misdemeanor but it's more than a moving violation;

497
00:38:38,626 --> 00:38:40,459
it's a crime.

498
00:38:41,999 --> 00:38:44,083
That would fall under that.

499
00:38:44,083 --> 00:38:48,999
I think California has the same law, too, but don't quote me on that.

500
00:38:48,999 --> 00:38:52,334
I read a lot of state laws and they all start with to blur together.

501
00:38:53,834 --> 00:38:57,501
I would suggest you check your sources

502
00:38:57,501 --> 00:39:02,876
on the "New York Times" article as far as the availability

503
00:39:02,876 --> 00:39:06,876
of the toll tag reader ID to NSA.

504
00:39:06,999 --> 00:39:09,834
I know the people who built the system.

505
00:39:09,834 --> 00:39:10,999
PUKINGMONKEY: Yeah.

506
00:39:10,999 --> 00:39:12,667
We don't keep any of that data.

507
00:39:12,667 --> 00:39:14,999
PUKINGMONKEY: Is that New York City DOT?

508
00:39:14,999 --> 00:39:18,751
Yes, along with the system the DOT, the last thing they want to know

509
00:39:18,751 --> 00:39:21,999
is who the hell is driving that car.

510
00:39:23,999 --> 00:39:26,999
PUKINGMONKEY: But they said EZ Pass data

511
00:39:26,999 --> 00:39:31,959
if it was actually    All toll tag datas are scrubbed, so double check

512
00:39:31,959 --> 00:39:34,999
the source on the "New York Times" and also

513
00:39:34,999 --> 00:39:39,834
with the Inrix data, you might want to double check that source, too,

514
00:39:39,834 --> 00:39:42,417
because I challenge you to find anyone

515
00:39:42,417 --> 00:39:45,999
at Inrix that can pinpoint a vehicle.

516
00:39:45,999 --> 00:39:48,292
PUKINGMONKEY: I'm not saying they can't.

517
00:39:48,292 --> 00:39:52,209
All I'm letting you know is you are being tracked, at this point.

518
00:39:52,209 --> 00:39:54,083
AUDIENCE MEMBER: You're being tracked on your Android phone,

519
00:39:54,083 --> 00:39:55,751
but I think Google has a better chance

520
00:39:55,751 --> 00:39:57,999
of identifying you than Inrix.

521
00:39:57,999 --> 00:40:02,999
AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Away from microphone.) (Applause.)

522
00:40:02,999 --> 00:40:06,417
Where do you want to go?

523
00:40:06,667 --> 00:40:11,167
(Laughter.)    AUDIENCE MEMBER: I was wondering

524
00:40:11,167 --> 00:40:17,459
if you've done any experiments with putting, like, a coat

525
00:40:17,459 --> 00:40:27,209
of clear coat paint over a layer of salt to stabilize it so it doesn't watch off?

526
00:40:27,209 --> 00:40:27,999
PUKINGMONKEY: No, I actually want it to wash

527
00:40:27,999 --> 00:40:31,292
off because let's say you have to go through a car inspection.

528
00:40:31,876 --> 00:40:38,999
You have to wash it off but these are up to I'm not saying to do any of this,

529
00:40:38,999 --> 00:40:42,876
actually, this is just ideas.

530
00:40:47,876 --> 00:40:51,334
(Laughter.) These are just ideas!

531
00:40:51,334 --> 00:40:53,083
AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Away from microphone.)

532
00:40:53,083 --> 00:40:57,667
PUKINGMONKEY: I'm not sure how they detect if it's reflective or not, right,

533
00:40:57,667 --> 00:41:02,334
because it's a laser beam that says if I get enough back it's fine, at a corner,

534
00:41:02,334 --> 00:41:05,083
all I know is that is part of their inspection

535
00:41:05,083 --> 00:41:07,501
criteria, Massachusetts.

536
00:41:07,501 --> 00:41:12,999
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Is there any state law that says you must keep your

537
00:41:12,999 --> 00:41:15,876
license plate clean?

538
00:41:16,626 --> 00:41:19,876
PUKINGMONKEY: It's the same as the obscured plate law.

539
00:41:21,959 --> 00:41:25,083
You cannot put mud or stuff on it.

540
00:41:25,167 --> 00:41:28,334
Typically it has to be visible and that's why I liked the salt

541
00:41:28,334 --> 00:41:32,999
because visibly it doesn't look like it, and in states that have winters it's

542
00:41:32,999 --> 00:41:37,999
kinda common to have salted plates, not probably very common out here.

543
00:41:39,918 --> 00:41:45,999
AUDIENCE MEMBER: My question is how did you salt your plates

544
00:41:45,999 --> 00:41:49,250
to maintain deniability.

545
00:41:49,250 --> 00:41:53,584
PUKINGMONKEY: Water, salt, super saturated, pour on the plate,

546
00:41:53,584 --> 00:41:56,417
off the car, let it dry.

547
00:42:02,501 --> 00:42:11,667
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Thanks for speaking with us.

548
00:42:11,751 --> 00:42:16,417
I had a quick question about the data and how it's available.

549
00:42:16,626 --> 00:42:22,918
If we can contact our local counties and get this information for free?

550
00:42:23,083 --> 00:42:27,501
As far as when our plates were read?

551
00:42:27,501 --> 00:42:32,542
PUKINGMONKEY: I don't know how they typically will not give this data out.

552
00:42:32,542 --> 00:42:34,209
Minneapolis is the only one I know.

553
00:42:34,209 --> 00:42:37,209
They did it briefly and then recanted and said we're not going

554
00:42:37,209 --> 00:42:42,459
to provide this anymore, so I know of no one that is proving it to people,

555
00:42:42,459 --> 00:42:45,959
but the company, TLO.com, you can purchase that,

556
00:42:45,959 --> 00:42:49,959
but it's privately collected data, which there is no laws

557
00:42:49,959 --> 00:42:52,209
against any of that.

558
00:42:52,626 --> 00:43:01,083
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Thank you.

559
00:43:01,083 --> 00:43:05,876
AUDIENCE MEMBER: You put effort into investigating state by state

560
00:43:05,876 --> 00:43:08,999
the rules for changing license plates

561
00:43:08,999 --> 00:43:14,792
and I appreciate that but what is the perceived advantage?

562
00:43:16,626 --> 00:43:18,999
PUKINGMONKEY: You have less of a history.

563
00:43:19,459 --> 00:43:22,542
You can still if people have a routine that's every day

564
00:43:22,542 --> 00:43:26,709
of the week you're detected very quickly, but they could go back

565
00:43:26,709 --> 00:43:29,584
and say, well, he's only done this for a week

566
00:43:29,584 --> 00:43:32,999
if you change your plates every week.

567
00:43:33,792 --> 00:43:36,334
But they also have all your previous plates

568
00:43:36,334 --> 00:43:38,999
but I don't think that's a common practice

569
00:43:38,999 --> 00:43:42,876
to change your plates a lot so they might not say, let's go back

570
00:43:42,876 --> 00:43:47,167
and look for all his old plates but it would be trivial to do that query,

571
00:43:47,167 --> 00:43:50,417
here is his ten plates, run 'em all.

572
00:43:50,584 --> 00:43:55,167
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Do you know of any paint that you can use

573
00:43:55,167 --> 00:44:02,584
on the infrared spectrum that would be transparent on the visible spectrum?

574
00:44:02,584 --> 00:44:06,999
PUKINGMONKEY: Myth busters did this and busted it so I didn't go

575
00:44:06,999 --> 00:44:09,083
down that road.

576
00:44:10,083 --> 00:44:13,209
They said they had a bunch of things for a red light camera,

577
00:44:13,209 --> 00:44:15,083
some sort of spray that did not work

578
00:44:15,083 --> 00:44:19,083
and I saw it advertised, I did not purchase it or try it.

579
00:44:19,209 --> 00:44:24,125
That's usually for speeders trying to avoid laser detectors.

580
00:44:24,125 --> 00:44:27,250
AUDIENCE MEMBER: A lot of questions focused on trying

581
00:44:27,250 --> 00:44:32,334
to prevent reading of your plate and as you mentioned every state has

582
00:44:32,334 --> 00:44:36,999
an obscured license plate law, what about a different approach,

583
00:44:36,999 --> 00:44:41,459
feed it go bad data, lots and lots of bad data.

584
00:44:41,459 --> 00:44:45,334
PUKINGMONKEY: That's one of the things the detector is trying

585
00:44:45,334 --> 00:44:48,999
to find your plate so if you get reflective material

586
00:44:48,999 --> 00:44:53,584
about nonreflective numbers on it, it will probably find your plate

587
00:44:53,584 --> 00:44:56,959
and read the other bad data along with it so you

588
00:44:56,959 --> 00:45:01,584
will still probably be captured, but as well as your bumper sticker,

589
00:45:01,584 --> 00:45:04,999
that you tried to say semi colon 1 equals 1 to try

590
00:45:04,999 --> 00:45:10,375
to dump on it, but you gotta do that in, like, eight characters.

591
00:45:10,959 --> 00:45:16,751
AUDIENCE MEMBER: My questions is about sanding down license plates.

592
00:45:16,751 --> 00:45:18,417
I have a bunch of people in Arizona that sand 'em down,

593
00:45:18,417 --> 00:45:20,999
everything around the numbers.

594
00:45:20,999 --> 00:45:21,999
What's that about?

595
00:45:23,999 --> 00:45:28,709
PUKINGMONKEY: Sanding the plate will remove the reflectivity.

596
00:45:28,709 --> 00:45:33,999
AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Away from microphone.)

597
00:45:33,999 --> 00:45:42,918
PUKINGMONKEY: Yeah, it has the numbers though on it, right?

598
00:45:42,918 --> 00:45:43,918
Visibly.

599
00:45:44,250 --> 00:45:50,083
One of the ways detectors are looking to find it on the back of the car, one

600
00:45:50,083 --> 00:45:54,792
of the ways it does that is by reflectivity.
