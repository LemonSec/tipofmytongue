1
00:00:00,042 --> 00:00:02,999
Any

2
00:00:02,999 --> 00:00:08,709
with social engineering, it seems

3
00:00:08,709 --> 00:00:12,918
get together with Apollo,

4
00:00:12,918 --> 00:00:17,042
at getting close to people

5
00:00:17,042 --> 00:00:21,209
and we know psychological

6
00:00:21,209 --> 00:00:27,167
and security perspective getting close

7
00:00:27,167 --> 00:00:32,042
uncomfortable

8
00:00:32,042 --> 00:00:37,292
So Apollo was part

9
00:00:37,292 --> 00:00:38,292
Yeah.

10
00:00:38,292 --> 00:00:41,042
It was never released

11
00:00:41,542 --> 00:00:45,834
He's got a clip and as soon

12
00:00:45,834 --> 00:00:48,459
going to open up this session

13
00:00:48,459 --> 00:00:53,083
of that video so you get a sense

14
00:00:53,083 --> 00:00:57,876
and then we're going to do some Q

15
00:00:57,876 --> 00:01:02,334
of the talk is the "60 minutes

16
00:01:02,334 --> 00:01:03,999
52 minutes.

17
00:01:15,959 --> 00:01:20,250
APOLLO: That's natural!

18
00:01:23,417 --> 00:01:25,125
Everyone get

19
00:01:25,125 --> 00:01:28,542
around and watch this screen

20
00:01:28,542 --> 00:01:31,834
and watch    APOLLO: I wanted

21
00:01:31,834 --> 00:01:34,083
with you a little closer.

22
00:01:34,083 --> 00:01:38,083
Suckers!

23
00:01:38,083 --> 00:01:40,709
APOLLO: This is a test,

24
00:01:40,709 --> 00:01:44,792
on half of my body is cut off so

25
00:01:44,792 --> 00:01:47,667
for them to see,

26
00:01:47,667 --> 00:01:51,959
raise your hand so I know who you are

27
00:01:51,959 --> 00:01:52,959
Two, three?

28
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:55,709
I don't care about you guys,

29
00:01:56,083 --> 00:01:59,667
The nature of a" con "most

30
00:01:59,667 --> 00:02:03,709
with when you hear

31
00:02:03,709 --> 00:02:08,125
for confidence and the idea

32
00:02:08,125 --> 00:02:10,083
of your mark?

33
00:02:10,083 --> 00:02:11,125
How do you get them

34
00:02:11,125 --> 00:02:13,375
about what they're doing?

35
00:02:13,375 --> 00:02:15,501
The difference between belief

36
00:02:15,501 --> 00:02:18,083
you can believe something I think it

37
00:02:18,083 --> 00:02:20,417
but if you can get somebody

38
00:02:20,417 --> 00:02:23,626
they will doubt their assumptions,

39
00:02:23,626 --> 00:02:25,918
they will move forward.

40
00:02:25,999 --> 00:02:34,083
That's how to get them concrete,

41
00:02:35,834 --> 00:02:37,999
And the social engineering is trying

42
00:02:37,999 --> 00:02:42,667
into a science versus something that's

43
00:02:43,751 --> 00:02:47,709
I don't know in I can add anything

44
00:02:50,542 --> 00:02:52,584
(Chuckles.) I always hate when I ask

45
00:02:52,584 --> 00:02:55,417
because then I get one hand

46
00:02:55,417 --> 00:02:57,709
How many people here listen

47
00:02:57,999 --> 00:03:00,375
Good, more than one,

48
00:03:00,375 --> 00:03:02,792
on the show, right?

49
00:03:03,083 --> 00:03:05,083
We're trying

50
00:03:05,083 --> 00:03:06,999
the principal

51
00:03:06,999 --> 00:03:08,999
to do what they do.

52
00:03:12,751 --> 00:03:16,959
It's not a magic trick it's understanding

53
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:20,334
the things that Apollo does

54
00:03:20,334 --> 00:03:22,999
If we can understand that we can

55
00:03:22,999 --> 00:03:25,999
since we are supposed to be

56
00:03:26,209 --> 00:03:28,999
This is a valuable lesson

57
00:03:28,999 --> 00:03:33,125
of us that do this for a living

58
00:03:33,209 --> 00:03:35,667
If you don't you have

59
00:03:35,667 --> 00:03:38,999
the last 18 month, guys,

60
00:03:38,999 --> 00:03:43,501
APOLLO: I think it's set

61
00:03:44,999 --> 00:03:47,834
I'm going to say three.

62
00:04:00,584 --> 00:04:03,501
APOLLO: Is there anybody here who

63
00:04:03,501 --> 00:04:06,209
for me that might be familiar

64
00:04:06,209 --> 00:04:10,626
past on the background when I do,

65
00:04:10,626 --> 00:04:13,501
or run cons,

66
00:04:13,501 --> 00:04:15,999
give time for those guys.

67
00:04:15,999 --> 00:04:18,999
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hay,

68
00:04:18,999 --> 00:04:22,667
psychological space

69
00:04:22,667 --> 00:04:24,999
or is it a matter

70
00:04:24,999 --> 00:04:27,250
suspicion elsewhere?

71
00:04:28,918 --> 00:04:30,999
You're right

72
00:04:30,999 --> 00:04:33,125
and that don't know you.

73
00:04:33,125 --> 00:04:35,751
APOLLO: That changes based

74
00:04:35,999 --> 00:04:40,751
When I perform and I'm doing

75
00:04:40,751 --> 00:04:46,125
videos of me I use a bit of magic

76
00:04:46,125 --> 00:04:49,999
to get inside that space

77
00:04:49,999 --> 00:04:54,999
with someone there are different zones,

78
00:04:54,999 --> 00:05:00,459
a book called" Different Dimension

79
00:05:00,459 --> 00:05:02,542
for a second?

80
00:05:02,999 --> 00:05:05,501
You saw the flinch here!

81
00:05:05,626 --> 00:05:07,375
Straight

82
00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:08,792
to face.

83
00:05:08,918 --> 00:05:12,999
As I walk close to him you have

84
00:05:12,999 --> 00:05:17,083
your personal space and then

85
00:05:17,209 --> 00:05:20,626
The difference between the intimate

86
00:05:20,626 --> 00:05:23,667
you can almost see, here,

87
00:05:23,667 --> 00:05:26,083
straightening right

88
00:05:26,083 --> 00:05:30,250
to shifting his center of body weight

89
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:34,999
if you think of it like paying a toll,

90
00:05:34,999 --> 00:05:37,417
to get inside that space.

91
00:05:37,417 --> 00:05:39,959
The way I do that is making

92
00:05:39,959 --> 00:05:41,999
to the environment.

93
00:05:41,999 --> 00:05:44,083
So a lot of times when I'm performing

94
00:05:44,083 --> 00:05:47,125
through my performing persona

95
00:05:47,125 --> 00:05:50,999
but on the street they have to come

96
00:05:50,999 --> 00:05:54,292
assisting you with asking you

97
00:05:54,292 --> 00:05:57,999
for the time

98
00:05:58,375 --> 00:06:01,999
The space he has is shaped like an egg.

99
00:06:02,459 --> 00:06:04,709
Not just yourself personally,

100
00:06:04,709 --> 00:06:07,999
is (Laughter.) Wasn't a personal dig,

101
00:06:08,751 --> 00:06:11,709
It comes out like an oval here

102
00:06:11,709 --> 00:06:14,083
on the sides and in the back.

103
00:06:14,459 --> 00:06:17,083
To get into that that means I can get

104
00:06:17,083 --> 00:06:18,959
comfortable to him.

105
00:06:19,417 --> 00:06:22,375
Go ahead and face straight up to me.

106
00:06:22,417 --> 00:06:25,751
As I walk

107
00:06:25,751 --> 00:06:28,709
more comfortable

108
00:06:28,709 --> 00:06:33,292
and stepping into the space

109
00:06:33,292 --> 00:06:38,709
into the space it's more tense for him,

110
00:06:38,709 --> 00:06:40,459
was seeing.

111
00:06:41,083 --> 00:06:45,751
But same thing, if I don't want him

112
00:06:45,751 --> 00:06:49,542
I can pull his attention

113
00:06:49,542 --> 00:06:51,334
in that zone.

114
00:06:51,459 --> 00:06:55,584
Imagine one

115
00:06:55,584 --> 00:06:59,083
is if you wanted

116
00:06:59,083 --> 00:07:03,083
and how do I get close to his badge?

117
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:06,626
What would be an excuse to come

118
00:07:06,626 --> 00:07:08,626
to an RFID reader?

119
00:07:11,876 --> 00:07:16,167
AUDIENCE MEMBER: To have

120
00:07:16,501 --> 00:07:18,751
APOLLO: But

121
00:07:18,751 --> 00:07:21,334
if you have a closer look and

122
00:07:21,334 --> 00:07:25,250
they would call that" kissing

123
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:28,959
of time with him and

124
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:32,083
look at my badge in the coffee shop.

125
00:07:32,918 --> 00:07:36,667
So context,

126
00:07:36,667 --> 00:07:42,167
at the badge and you may say" that's

127
00:07:42,167 --> 00:07:47,501
under the radar and have him not

128
00:07:47,501 --> 00:07:52,584
else, if I'm serving appetizers

129
00:07:52,584 --> 00:07:57,918
a tray, I ask him if he wants something,

130
00:07:57,918 --> 00:08:01,167
or underneath a stack of books.

131
00:08:01,375 --> 00:08:05,209
Sorry, could you hold this for me,

132
00:08:05,209 --> 00:08:09,626
on to he's holding it in front

133
00:08:09,626 --> 00:08:14,542
much but I don't ask permission I might

134
00:08:14,542 --> 00:08:18,999
I apologize for why I was doing it,

135
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:20,999
inside the space.

136
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:23,667
Obviously depends on kind

137
00:08:23,667 --> 00:08:27,292
of context mixed with plausibility.

138
00:08:29,834 --> 00:08:31,667
That projector shot the dust?

139
00:08:31,667 --> 00:08:35,542
Did we do a call of" death tone "on

140
00:08:37,792 --> 00:08:40,999
Did you want

141
00:08:40,999 --> 00:08:44,999
APOLLO: We can do questions

142
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:46,125
Round of applause?

143
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:49,999
(Applause.) Out

144
00:08:49,999 --> 00:08:55,417
a few of you can't see this screen at all,

145
00:08:56,083 --> 00:08:57,876
You can't see this screen?

146
00:08:58,999 --> 00:09:00,751
You can see it?

147
00:09:00,751 --> 00:09:03,999
Just for the first few rows that can't

148
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:07,083
if you want to move over and

149
00:09:07,083 --> 00:09:08,584
can stay.

150
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:13,792
There are seats and we can start

151
00:09:13,792 --> 00:09:17,999
come o Christina, Michael,

152
00:09:17,999 --> 00:09:19,375
APOLLO: I would love

153
00:09:19,375 --> 00:09:21,250
to show you on this

154
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:24,334
about it I'm worried that some

155
00:09:24,334 --> 00:09:26,250
of what we're saying.

156
00:09:26,584 --> 00:09:27,999
Other questions?

157
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:29,501
Right here?

158
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:41,125
AUDIENCE MEMBER: We would

159
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:44,709
and what you're doing,

160
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:45,709
APOLLO: No?

161
00:09:45,709 --> 00:09:47,501
AUDIENCE MEMBER: What

162
00:09:47,501 --> 00:09:49,834
or can we find online?

163
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:55,125
APOLLO: The only thing that's

164
00:09:55,125 --> 00:10:00,083
at TEG Global coming

165
00:10:04,834 --> 00:10:08,751
As far as materials I can point you

166
00:10:08,918 --> 00:10:10,250
That book I mentioned"

167
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:11,999
a great resource.

168
00:10:11,999 --> 00:10:16,125
A lot of the work I do

169
00:10:16,125 --> 00:10:21,459
false assumptions,

170
00:10:21,834 --> 00:10:25,709
If you were interested

171
00:10:25,709 --> 00:10:29,125
on critical thinking that jumps

172
00:10:29,125 --> 00:10:33,250
is a great book called" Thinking: Fast

173
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:37,626
about on you hour minds work,

174
00:10:37,626 --> 00:10:41,999
of us would probably pride ourselves

175
00:10:41,999 --> 00:10:43,999
wouldn't you say?

176
00:10:43,999 --> 00:10:45,999
We don't get affect we try

177
00:10:45,999 --> 00:10:49,667
instead of stepping

178
00:10:52,292 --> 00:10:54,626
Here he talks

179
00:10:54,626 --> 00:10:58,042
and we react faster

180
00:10:58,042 --> 00:11:01,999
respond to something

181
00:11:01,999 --> 00:11:05,959
and the fault with that

182
00:11:05,959 --> 00:11:10,125
set you are subject to biases

183
00:11:10,125 --> 00:11:15,876
might not be aware of which is great

184
00:11:15,876 --> 00:11:18,751
Because if I can identify what you have

185
00:11:18,751 --> 00:11:21,083
along the line you have established

186
00:11:21,083 --> 00:11:23,999
they are my building block

187
00:11:23,999 --> 00:11:26,999
Any other questions?

188
00:11:34,083 --> 00:11:36,334
Keep your hand up.

189
00:11:36,334 --> 00:11:37,834
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hello.

190
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:40,292
APOLLO: Hi!

191
00:11:40,292 --> 00:11:42,918
AUDIENCE MEMBER: So humor can

192
00:11:42,918 --> 00:11:46,334
to people while keeping them

193
00:11:46,334 --> 00:11:49,542
APOLLO: Yeah, humor

194
00:11:50,792 --> 00:11:54,250
I used to use that for drawing crowds

195
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:57,417
because I wasn't applause,

196
00:11:57,417 --> 00:12:00,459
people wonder, would I laugh at that?

197
00:12:00,999 --> 00:12:05,083
So it's something that you think

198
00:12:05,083 --> 00:12:08,209
so if you can artificially laugh

199
00:12:08,209 --> 00:12:11,334
inside of a situation it's engaging.

200
00:12:12,542 --> 00:12:17,167
A friend of mine used to run

201
00:12:17,167 --> 00:12:21,876
he would use this for selling guns

202
00:12:21,876 --> 00:12:26,999
and his main ability was making people

203
00:12:26,999 --> 00:12:29,751
like my friends here.

204
00:12:42,209 --> 00:12:46,083
And when people could come

205
00:12:46,083 --> 00:12:50,125
he answers, he's in his robe,

206
00:12:50,125 --> 00:12:54,918
out on the bed and he would say,

207
00:12:54,918 --> 00:12:58,999
now you guys are early but he let us

208
00:12:58,999 --> 00:13:02,999
the guns are or the drugs to come

209
00:13:02,999 --> 00:13:07,501
in the door he has a conversation,

210
00:13:07,876 --> 00:13:10,292
We'll count it later, stick it in the drawer.

211
00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:14,999
He chats with them for a bit, says,

212
00:13:14,999 --> 00:13:18,999
about I'll get the stuff and bring it in,

213
00:13:18,999 --> 00:13:21,999
They say yes, he steps out of the room,

214
00:13:21,999 --> 00:13:25,959
with the money and his stuff,

215
00:13:25,959 --> 00:13:28,999
the stuff from another room

216
00:13:28,999 --> 00:13:31,167
he never comes back.

217
00:13:31,584 --> 00:13:33,250
At some point

218
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:36,083
finally they decide, you know,

219
00:13:36,083 --> 00:13:38,667
they open the drawer, it's empty.

220
00:13:39,375 --> 00:13:43,459
What my friend did was he was

221
00:13:43,459 --> 00:13:47,250
in the wall and pulled everything

222
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:49,250
and taken it out.

223
00:13:49,417 --> 00:13:53,125
He said the ability of that guy

224
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:56,999
made them feel at he's and feeling

225
00:13:56,999 --> 00:14:01,334
is here but it's empty, when they look

226
00:14:01,334 --> 00:14:04,667
and under his robe were his clothes

227
00:14:04,667 --> 00:14:07,125
of the cons they used to run.

228
00:14:07,542 --> 00:14:08,667
Any other questions?

229
00:14:08,751 --> 00:14:14,209
AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Away

230
00:14:14,292 --> 00:14:16,751
AUDIENCE MEMBER: This might be

231
00:14:16,751 --> 00:14:18,834
but what do you think

232
00:14:18,834 --> 00:14:22,292
the Mentalist "and the character

233
00:14:23,334 --> 00:14:30,709
APOLLO: It's a cool area of study,

234
00:14:30,999 --> 00:14:34,626
If any of you seen

235
00:14:34,626 --> 00:14:35,083
see me?

236
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:37,999
"Is that what it's called?

237
00:14:37,999 --> 00:14:42,751
The illusionist, slight of hand artist,

238
00:14:42,751 --> 00:14:47,751
It's a different category,

239
00:14:47,751 --> 00:14:54,999
and there is an interesting thing,

240
00:14:54,999 --> 00:14:58,083
you guys were great!

241
00:15:00,501 --> 00:15:03,292
(Applause.)    APOLLO: Thank you

242
00:15:07,083 --> 00:15:10,999
Mentalist and psychic are

243
00:15:10,999 --> 00:15:14,999
but it's a skill I have learned and

244
00:15:14,999 --> 00:15:18,125
the perception that they're doing that.

245
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:21,876
In that character the mentalist there

246
00:15:21,876 --> 00:15:26,083
hot reading and tools that he's using

247
00:15:26,083 --> 00:15:31,083
real and that's personal to my life

248
00:15:31,083 --> 00:15:32,999
Ready to begin?

249
00:15:32,999 --> 00:15:34,626
We are ready to begin,

250
00:15:34,626 --> 00:15:38,125
after but let's get started

251
00:15:38,125 --> 00:15:41,999
APOLLO: So just a set up on this

252
00:15:41,999 --> 00:15:46,542
out of Montreal and it's 10 minutes long

253
00:15:46,542 --> 00:15:50,542
and a little bit of stealing

254
00:15:50,542 --> 00:15:53,167
on to try to make it

255
00:15:53,167 --> 00:15:56,999
in 10 minutes so make your

256
00:15:56,999 --> 00:15:59,999
to go and see how well it works.

257
00:16:21,167 --> 00:16:23,792
It's waiting for the DVD to load

258
00:16:23,792 --> 00:16:25,667
that's not you guys.

259
00:16:25,667 --> 00:16:36,083
It's one of those things that happens

260
00:16:36,083 --> 00:16:42,999
and    APOLLO: Okay we need

261
00:16:42,999 --> 00:16:49,542
over to the other screen for you.

262
00:16:51,834 --> 00:16:54,167
That's a fun game and play.

263
00:17:03,292 --> 00:17:07,999
(Sirens) (Music Playing.)    That's

264
00:17:07,999 --> 00:17:11,792
The automatic zoom, unfortunately,

265
00:17:11,792 --> 00:17:13,250
What do you mean all gone?

266
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:16,918
Gone, gone, bye bye,

267
00:17:16,918 --> 00:17:19,501
everything must go.

268
00:17:20,999 --> 00:17:22,375
(Laughing).

269
00:17:23,999 --> 00:17:25,999
What does it say here?

270
00:17:27,999 --> 00:17:31,083
Saturday, February 19.

271
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:32,999
Exactly that's today.

272
00:17:32,999 --> 00:17:34,417
Today, yeah, today.

273
00:17:35,083 --> 00:17:37,375
It's 9:02 a.m.

274
00:17:37,918 --> 00:17:40,999
the sale started two minutes ago

275
00:17:40,999 --> 00:17:43,709
Yeah,

276
00:17:43,876 --> 00:17:45,083
Where?

277
00:17:53,083 --> 00:17:54,417
There.

278
00:17:54,417 --> 00:17:55,501
(Noise)    Wild star.

279
00:17:55,501 --> 00:17:58,876
At only $4,000 people didn't wait

280
00:17:58,876 --> 00:18:01,250
will tell you secret.

281
00:18:07,083 --> 00:18:10,999
You, sir,

282
00:18:10,999 --> 00:18:11,999
The SCX!

283
00:18:15,083 --> 00:18:22,584
(Music Playing.) This baby does it

284
00:18:22,584 --> 00:18:27,709
the same zoom

285
00:18:27,709 --> 00:18:29,918
want, huh?

286
00:18:29,999 --> 00:18:31,999
Come on feel how heavy it is.

287
00:18:31,999 --> 00:18:35,709
Oh man, I hate you.

288
00:18:35,751 --> 00:18:37,876
I know!

289
00:18:37,918 --> 00:18:41,999
You can't do this to me.

290
00:18:42,083 --> 00:18:48,999
After all I've done for you,

291
00:18:54,417 --> 00:18:56,834
Can I help you?

292
00:18:56,834 --> 00:19:00,083
Yes, my son is a thief.

293
00:19:00,083 --> 00:19:04,083
He stole my friend's credit card

294
00:19:04,083 --> 00:19:08,999
and bought a $5,000 camera,

295
00:19:08,999 --> 00:19:09,999
Ouch!

296
00:19:09,999 --> 00:19:17,999
How could you sell a kid

297
00:19:17,999 --> 00:19:21,542
That's impossible,

298
00:19:26,792 --> 00:19:29,125
So what did you want me

299
00:19:29,125 --> 00:19:33,626
to give me back my money

300
00:19:33,626 --> 00:19:35,709
What do you mean" final "?

301
00:19:38,999 --> 00:19:41,542
What you've done is illegal!

302
00:19:41,542 --> 00:19:42,792
Lady    Illegal!

303
00:19:42,792 --> 00:19:46,459
If you're so unhappy I can call

304
00:19:46,459 --> 00:19:47,959
for ya.

305
00:19:50,250 --> 00:20:13,751
Do you see

306
00:20:17,417 --> 00:20:18,999
I'm so sorry!

307
00:20:18,999 --> 00:20:21,584
Come on let me help you out!

308
00:20:21,584 --> 00:20:22,584
You good?

309
00:20:22,584 --> 00:20:23,584
Yeah.

310
00:20:23,584 --> 00:20:24,999
Do you see what happened?

311
00:20:24,999 --> 00:20:26,792
Enough, lady with the screaming.

312
00:20:26,792 --> 00:20:28,999
You have no right to hit your child

313
00:20:28,999 --> 00:20:31,375
No wonder he's stealing

314
00:20:31,375 --> 00:20:33,083
Did you want to fight, is that it?

315
00:20:33,083 --> 00:20:34,167
Did you want to fight?

316
00:20:34,167 --> 00:20:35,167
Honey?

317
00:20:35,167 --> 00:20:36,626
All right, lady, slap me!

318
00:20:36,626 --> 00:20:37,626
Ladies!

319
00:20:37,626 --> 00:20:38,626
Calm down!

320
00:20:38,626 --> 00:20:41,501
Using their child

321
00:20:44,999 --> 00:20:48,292
Listen, there

322
00:20:48,292 --> 00:20:50,042
your money.

323
00:20:50,042 --> 00:20:53,000
The best I can do is exchange it

324
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,834
but come hell or high water you're

325
00:20:55,834 --> 00:20:58,626
to give that man back his $5,000!

326
00:20:58,626 --> 00:20:59,918
Great!

327
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:08,125
Good choice, sir, $5,999.99

328
00:21:08,334 --> 00:21:09,999
Thank you.

329
00:21:13,375 --> 00:21:17,417
David Brown, same name

330
00:21:17,417 --> 00:21:18,417
Really?

331
00:21:18,417 --> 00:21:19,501
I want that one.

332
00:21:19,501 --> 00:21:20,792
The AG Beta?

333
00:21:20,999 --> 00:21:22,876
No, that's way more expensive.

334
00:21:24,375 --> 00:21:25,999
I'll get you a bag.

335
00:21:35,083 --> 00:21:39,417
Here is your new camera,

336
00:21:39,417 --> 00:21:42,250
Look, it's completely new

337
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:43,250
Yeah, yeah.

338
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:44,999
One more thing.

339
00:21:45,083 --> 00:21:47,167
Please come again!

340
00:21:47,167 --> 00:21:52,751
Now I want you to apologize

341
00:21:52,751 --> 00:21:55,626
all that trouble!

342
00:21:55,999 --> 00:21:58,542
Sorry for the confusion.

343
00:21:58,667 --> 00:21:59,667
It's okay.

344
00:21:59,667 --> 00:22:00,834
I'll buzz you out.

345
00:22:00,834 --> 00:22:02,709
Apologize for real!

346
00:22:02,709 --> 00:22:03,709
I'm sorry!

347
00:22:03,709 --> 00:22:10,083
This is the last time I'm going

348
00:22:12,999 --> 00:22:14,999
I'm sorry.

349
00:22:14,999 --> 00:22:16,375
(Buzzing door)    I'm sorry.

350
00:22:16,375 --> 00:22:17,584
Just give me the bag.

351
00:22:17,584 --> 00:22:18,584
I'm sorry!

352
00:22:18,584 --> 00:22:20,459
Okay, that's enough!

353
00:22:20,459 --> 00:22:22,876
Here we go again!

354
00:22:22,876 --> 00:22:25,959
Okay, lady, if that's

355
00:22:25,959 --> 00:22:27,751
I'll handle it.

356
00:22:27,751 --> 00:22:29,959
Don't worry kid I'll get you

357
00:22:29,959 --> 00:22:30,999
I'm calling the police.

358
00:22:32,584 --> 00:22:34,459
My phone!

359
00:22:34,459 --> 00:22:35,459
What?

360
00:22:35,459 --> 00:22:36,459
The door!

361
00:22:36,459 --> 00:22:37,459
Stop!

362
00:22:37,459 --> 00:22:42,999
(Buzzing door)    It's him,

363
00:22:43,209 --> 00:22:45,417
Hold on a minute.

364
00:22:45,999 --> 00:22:47,626
What's your phone number.

365
00:22:47,626 --> 00:22:48,626
555.

366
00:22:48,626 --> 00:22:49,626
555.

367
00:22:49,626 --> 00:22:50,626
66 66.

368
00:22:50,626 --> 00:22:51,626
65.

369
00:22:51,626 --> 00:22:52,626
65.

370
00:22:52,626 --> 00:22:53,999
(Phone ringing)    You see?

371
00:22:53,999 --> 00:22:54,999
It wasn't him.

372
00:22:54,999 --> 00:22:56,334
What the heck is going on?

373
00:22:56,334 --> 00:22:58,584
I don't know,

374
00:22:58,584 --> 00:23:00,125
That's my credit card my wallet.

375
00:23:00,125 --> 00:23:04,999
My wallet too, it's the boy!

376
00:23:04,999 --> 00:23:08,375
(Laughing) (Cars chasing)    Saturday,

377
00:23:08,375 --> 00:23:09,959
Exactly, that's today.

378
00:23:09,959 --> 00:23:10,959
Today, yeah.

379
00:23:10,959 --> 00:23:12,083
It's 9:02 a.m.

380
00:23:42,417 --> 00:23:50,667
and the sale started 2 minutes ago

381
00:23:54,417 --> 00:24:41,999
You notice what's written here.

382
00:24:44,292 --> 00:24:51,459
You see

383
00:24:51,459 --> 00:24:54,501
(Noise)    I'm so sorry!

384
00:25:01,876 --> 00:25:04,751
I'm okay.

385
00:25:04,751 --> 00:25:10,083
(Noises)    You wanna fight?

386
00:25:10,083 --> 00:25:11,083
Huh?

387
00:25:11,083 --> 00:25:12,083
Go ahead.

388
00:25:12,083 --> 00:25:13,083
Slap me!

389
00:25:13,083 --> 00:25:14,999
My credit card    That's a real steal!

390
00:25:14,999 --> 00:25:15,999
David Brown.

391
00:25:15,999 --> 00:25:17,083
Let me get you a bag.

392
00:25:17,083 --> 00:25:18,083
Say sorry!

393
00:25:18,083 --> 00:25:19,083
Sorry.

394
00:25:19,083 --> 00:25:20,083
Sorry.

395
00:25:20,083 --> 00:25:22,209
(Music Playing.) (Sirens)    Yes, hello!

396
00:25:22,209 --> 00:25:32,709
My son (Applause.)    APOLLO:

397
00:25:32,709 --> 00:25:47,167
of our time and we only have

398
00:25:47,167 --> 00:26:01,542
but I wanted to give you

399
00:26:01,542 --> 00:26:10,083
all these cons all used together.

400
00:26:10,417 --> 00:26:12,834
I thought I would give you

401
00:26:12,834 --> 00:26:15,709
if you have questions

402
00:26:21,918 --> 00:26:26,250
AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Away

403
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:29,250
want to come over this way.

404
00:26:29,292 --> 00:26:32,292
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Maybe what

405
00:26:32,292 --> 00:26:33,999
is a Grifter?

406
00:26:34,999 --> 00:26:39,792
APOLLO: Generally

407
00:26:39,792 --> 00:26:44,999
beyond con artist, cat burglars,

408
00:26:44,999 --> 00:26:48,417
of technique and wit is Grift.

409
00:26:51,209 --> 00:26:54,834
We had an interview

410
00:26:54,834 --> 00:26:58,999
he was conned once and

411
00:26:58,999 --> 00:27:03,792
he realized that con men work

412
00:27:03,792 --> 00:27:10,250
they trust you not that you trust them,

413
00:27:10,250 --> 00:27:14,083
How is it that you make other people

414
00:27:14,083 --> 00:27:17,999
a way that they're not looking

415
00:27:17,999 --> 00:27:19,792
in the video?

416
00:27:19,792 --> 00:27:22,417
APOLLO: I think there

417
00:27:22,417 --> 00:27:24,999
"associated with trust.

418
00:27:25,709 --> 00:27:28,834
I think like is a cherry on top.

419
00:27:28,834 --> 00:27:32,167
If you like me, that's great

420
00:27:32,334 --> 00:27:34,751
What I want you to do

421
00:27:34,792 --> 00:27:38,083
I want you me to be transparent to you.

422
00:27:38,167 --> 00:27:40,083
So

423
00:27:40,083 --> 00:27:43,999
my objectives, what I want,

424
00:27:43,999 --> 00:27:47,501
up, the more likely you are

425
00:27:47,501 --> 00:27:51,667
in the sense of what you're doing,

426
00:27:51,667 --> 00:27:53,999
If you think about an example

427
00:27:53,999 --> 00:27:57,083
you might not trust them

428
00:27:57,083 --> 00:27:58,834
just

429
00:27:58,834 --> 00:28:02,125
because you know their mistakes

430
00:28:02,125 --> 00:28:05,999
if they're a friend you won't trust them

431
00:28:06,209 --> 00:28:07,626
On the other hand

432
00:28:07,626 --> 00:28:11,334
like but he's capable, you're going

433
00:28:12,626 --> 00:28:16,626
So it's the ability for had he to give

434
00:28:16,626 --> 00:28:19,999
of transparency that I'm

435
00:28:19,999 --> 00:28:23,417
the job done so as part

436
00:28:23,417 --> 00:28:28,918
of those levels is for me to put you

437
00:28:28,918 --> 00:28:30,792
referring to.

438
00:28:31,083 --> 00:28:33,999
The combatives who I worked

439
00:28:33,999 --> 00:28:36,417
with special forces and

440
00:28:36,417 --> 00:28:39,834
they use" feeder/receiver, so

441
00:28:39,834 --> 00:28:43,999
of the fight and the receiver of the fight,

442
00:28:43,999 --> 00:28:46,999
in is to appear you are

443
00:28:46,999 --> 00:28:48,584
the feeder.

444
00:28:48,792 --> 00:28:50,584
That's an advanced technique.

445
00:28:51,876 --> 00:28:55,083
If I can be steering

446
00:28:55,083 --> 00:28:58,626
you're the one that's

447
00:28:58,626 --> 00:29:00,999
help, that's even better

448
00:29:00,999 --> 00:29:03,999
the suspicion level way below radar.

449
00:29:04,083 --> 00:29:05,918
That's valuable.

450
00:29:05,918 --> 00:29:08,083
So I think for us, because we're

451
00:29:08,083 --> 00:29:11,667
like to do this as a hobby or

452
00:29:11,667 --> 00:29:12,876
APOLLO: Yeah.

453
00:29:12,876 --> 00:29:16,584
In our classes we teach similar

454
00:29:16,584 --> 00:29:18,999
when you were talking

455
00:29:18,999 --> 00:29:23,667
and making people feel comfortable

456
00:29:23,667 --> 00:29:27,626
what's the next skill I need in order

457
00:29:27,626 --> 00:29:30,542
from you without you feeling it?

458
00:29:30,667 --> 00:29:32,667
It's more than just trust at that point.

459
00:29:32,667 --> 00:29:34,459
APOLLO: It is, it's

460
00:29:34,459 --> 00:29:37,417
I'll show you a couple of visuals

461
00:29:37,626 --> 00:29:40,375
This is the complex way that I think

462
00:29:41,999 --> 00:29:44,709
Let me bring this up.

463
00:29:44,709 --> 00:29:46,626
Let me know if it comes

464
00:29:51,417 --> 00:29:54,083
You have all your senses coming

465
00:29:55,459 --> 00:29:59,584
But in my mind rather than that being

466
00:29:59,584 --> 00:30:04,999
is a little security guard sitting

467
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,999
Frank has really cool equipment.

468
00:30:06,999 --> 00:30:09,918
He has the eyes, the ears,

469
00:30:09,918 --> 00:30:13,999
and he's taking all these inputs

470
00:30:13,999 --> 00:30:16,042
what to do with them!

471
00:30:16,125 --> 00:30:18,626
What's important

472
00:30:18,626 --> 00:30:21,959
or take something from somebody

473
00:30:21,959 --> 00:30:25,999
is that most people misunderstand

474
00:30:25,999 --> 00:30:28,501
attention is the first step.

475
00:30:28,501 --> 00:30:31,792
Attention is the security fence

476
00:30:31,792 --> 00:30:33,083
It's

477
00:30:33,083 --> 00:30:35,667
are going to be dedicated to it.

478
00:30:35,999 --> 00:30:40,999
If they're not fending to something

479
00:30:40,999 --> 00:30:42,292
Even if the cameras are pointed

480
00:30:42,292 --> 00:30:45,083
at me it doesn't mean you're not going

481
00:30:48,584 --> 00:30:52,167
If I ask him the correct question

482
00:30:52,167 --> 00:30:55,000
to him in his priorities

483
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,292
at the file and rewind

484
00:30:57,292 --> 00:31:00,999
is an illusion that most people think

485
00:31:00,999 --> 00:31:04,292
and while theory winding

486
00:31:04,292 --> 00:31:07,417
at you and if they're thinking

487
00:31:07,417 --> 00:31:10,999
they can't process anything else,

488
00:31:10,999 --> 00:31:13,667
or watch and sometimes

489
00:31:13,667 --> 00:31:16,542
they don't realize that's happened.

490
00:31:16,542 --> 00:31:20,999
AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Away

491
00:31:20,999 --> 00:31:24,375
life example of stealing?

492
00:31:24,626 --> 00:31:25,999
Would you like to see that?

493
00:31:25,999 --> 00:31:27,083
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Yes!

494
00:31:27,209 --> 00:31:30,834
I actually found myself checking

495
00:31:30,834 --> 00:31:35,626
as he was saying that and I want

496
00:31:36,459 --> 00:31:37,834
Just kidding.

497
00:31:37,834 --> 00:31:40,125
APOLLO: Do you have anything

498
00:31:40,209 --> 00:31:44,417
Can you stand up for me real quick

499
00:31:44,417 --> 00:31:46,542
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Yeah,

500
00:31:46,542 --> 00:31:49,751
APOLLO: Cool.

501
00:31:49,751 --> 00:31:50,459
Now, the disadvantage

502
00:31:50,459 --> 00:31:53,667
on stage but if you can stand

503
00:31:55,999 --> 00:31:57,834
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Greg.

504
00:31:59,125 --> 00:32:01,751
APOLLO: Close your hand kinda

505
00:32:01,751 --> 00:32:04,999
past me did you check

506
00:32:05,334 --> 00:32:07,250
Your front pocket,

507
00:32:07,250 --> 00:32:08,584
the watch is gone,

508
00:32:08,584 --> 00:32:10,375
inside your front pocket?

509
00:32:10,375 --> 00:32:16,501
(Laughter.) Is it still there?

510
00:32:16,501 --> 00:32:18,083
Can I show you this is odd a lot

511
00:32:18,083 --> 00:32:19,918
familiar to you?

512
00:32:20,083 --> 00:32:21,125
Is that yours?

513
00:32:21,542 --> 00:32:23,292
AUDIENCE MEMBER: No.

514
00:32:23,292 --> 00:32:26,459
APOLLO: You're realizing your cell

515
00:32:26,459 --> 00:32:27,792
Those are two items

516
00:32:27,792 --> 00:32:30,250
is much more adversarial than you ever

517
00:32:30,250 --> 00:32:33,083
of someone who doesn't know who you

518
00:32:33,459 --> 00:32:37,834
So here he has seen me working

519
00:32:37,834 --> 00:32:38,834
Here you go.

520
00:32:38,834 --> 00:32:40,959
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Thank you

521
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:43,292
(Laughter.) (Applause.)    APOLLO:

522
00:32:43,292 --> 00:32:44,918
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Whoa hoo.

523
00:32:44,918 --> 00:32:45,626
APOLLO: Thanks for asking

524
00:32:45,626 --> 00:32:53,834
the questions are important, it's not

525
00:32:53,834 --> 00:32:58,876
the questions I asked him,

526
00:32:58,876 --> 00:33:04,125
by that wallet that you had

527
00:33:04,125 --> 00:33:12,083
that's his security guard saying,

528
00:33:12,083 --> 00:33:15,083
behind the game?

529
00:33:15,292 --> 00:33:17,375
And when he switches

530
00:33:17,375 --> 00:33:19,209
I removed the watch.

531
00:33:26,542 --> 00:33:29,667
I've got the moves

532
00:33:29,667 --> 00:33:33,083
audio) that I have light fingers I'm able

533
00:33:33,083 --> 00:33:35,709
and suppress his perceptions.

534
00:33:35,709 --> 00:33:38,501
So you use psychological

535
00:33:40,459 --> 00:33:44,501
I have a quick question,

536
00:33:44,501 --> 00:33:47,709
of being aware of these things

537
00:33:47,709 --> 00:33:51,334
do you have any experience

538
00:33:51,334 --> 00:33:55,542
whether or not we are, in fact, better

539
00:33:55,542 --> 00:33:58,459
if you have any advice for us.

540
00:33:58,999 --> 00:34:01,250
Be careful with your answer!

541
00:34:01,250 --> 00:34:10,999
APOLLO: A while back I performed

542
00:34:10,999 --> 00:34:16,626
of Secret Service came

543
00:34:16,626 --> 00:34:20,792
of you have heard this story.

544
00:34:20,792 --> 00:34:21,959
"

545
00:34:21,959 --> 00:34:25,167
Wheels up" "wheels down"

546
00:34:25,167 --> 00:34:29,792
and because one of the trainings

547
00:34:29,792 --> 00:34:34,709
it's "keep in mind" and you have

548
00:34:34,709 --> 00:34:38,542
to the task that you're doing which

549
00:34:38,542 --> 00:34:42,918
to spend my attention dollars

550
00:34:42,918 --> 00:34:46,209
an atrophy

551
00:34:46,209 --> 00:34:51,999
they're spending the attention

552
00:34:52,459 --> 00:34:55,626
In their case they would square

553
00:34:55,626 --> 00:34:57,999
and wouldn't let me get close,

554
00:34:57,999 --> 00:35:02,167
to pretend that I wasn't interested

555
00:35:02,167 --> 00:35:05,417
and now this person just let me

556
00:35:05,417 --> 00:35:08,584
because I'm doing it

557
00:35:08,584 --> 00:35:11,417
the game to be about him

558
00:35:11,417 --> 00:35:14,999
inside their space to steal their things.

559
00:35:16,083 --> 00:35:19,792
If you can understand

560
00:35:21,417 --> 00:35:23,999
(Laughter.) It was a treasure chest.

561
00:35:26,999 --> 00:35:30,292
He didn't steal your    APOLLO: As

562
00:35:30,292 --> 00:35:33,083
respond to the question, could

563
00:35:33,083 --> 00:35:34,667
in the air?

564
00:35:34,834 --> 00:35:39,083
This is a perception test,

565
00:35:39,083 --> 00:35:41,999
I'm going to show you two photos.

566
00:35:41,999 --> 00:35:43,250
There is going to be a change,

567
00:35:43,250 --> 00:35:45,250
the change put your right hand

568
00:35:45,250 --> 00:35:47,918
will know how fast it takes affect,

569
00:35:47,918 --> 00:35:50,375
of security professionals here

570
00:35:50,375 --> 00:35:52,876
the realtime results of this.

571
00:35:54,792 --> 00:35:57,999
This image is going to toggle back

572
00:35:57,999 --> 00:36:02,167
to your neighbor but when you see

573
00:36:05,999 --> 00:36:08,959
That's kind of an answer

574
00:36:08,959 --> 00:36:10,667
I'm scared now!

575
00:36:10,667 --> 00:36:13,334
APOLLO: Now I start giving you

576
00:36:13,334 --> 00:36:17,167
a tendency to get tunnel vision,

577
00:36:17,167 --> 00:36:21,584
start counting shoes and then it gives

578
00:36:21,584 --> 00:36:24,999
or more obvious, in any case

579
00:36:24,999 --> 00:36:29,584
without this and once you see it you

580
00:36:31,999 --> 00:36:35,083
For the rest of you look

581
00:36:35,083 --> 00:36:38,999
will see that the engine

582
00:36:39,834 --> 00:36:42,999
Now put your right hand

583
00:36:42,999 --> 00:36:46,083
APOLLO: You shouldn't feel stupid

584
00:36:46,083 --> 00:36:49,334
because I myself am susceptible

585
00:36:49,334 --> 00:36:53,709
but the difference

586
00:36:53,876 --> 00:36:56,501
When you know something that's when

587
00:36:56,501 --> 00:36:59,542
When you know your protocol

588
00:36:59,542 --> 00:37:02,375
scared because you have no room

589
00:37:02,375 --> 00:37:04,792
is what makes us secure.

590
00:37:05,999 --> 00:37:10,417
There is another example

591
00:37:11,250 --> 00:37:13,334
This is how I think about deception.

592
00:37:16,083 --> 00:37:18,751
let me grab this here, it would be easier.

593
00:37:18,876 --> 00:37:21,751
If you think

594
00:37:21,751 --> 00:37:24,125
now this is a micro, me

595
00:37:24,125 --> 00:37:28,751
with you guys and it's how you perceive

596
00:37:29,918 --> 00:37:33,584
Tennessee Williams,

597
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:37,542
write's create a play they forget

598
00:37:37,542 --> 00:37:41,792
because when the audience views

599
00:37:41,792 --> 00:37:45,834
the audience is the detective,

600
00:37:45,834 --> 00:37:50,209
or comedy they're trying

601
00:37:50,209 --> 00:37:53,584
day, hooking for patterns, what's

602
00:37:53,584 --> 00:37:56,999
what's happening right now,

603
00:37:56,999 --> 00:38:01,167
all of that's being processed just

604
00:38:01,167 --> 00:38:03,292
in front of you.

605
00:38:03,501 --> 00:38:07,709
Right now this is a good example

606
00:38:07,709 --> 00:38:11,999
in a real sense is controlling most

607
00:38:11,999 --> 00:38:13,999
So the dimmer areas you wouldn't know

608
00:38:13,999 --> 00:38:16,501
on you right now stealing

609
00:38:16,501 --> 00:38:18,709
up things I might do later.

610
00:38:18,999 --> 00:38:21,542
In the same way you have

611
00:38:21,542 --> 00:38:24,209
to spend your attention

612
00:38:24,209 --> 00:38:26,918
When it comes to deception there

613
00:38:26,918 --> 00:38:30,876
of happening simultaneously that's

614
00:38:30,876 --> 00:38:35,083
in this sense it's "back stage" kind

615
00:38:35,083 --> 00:38:39,167
the spoon bending and you realized it's

616
00:38:39,167 --> 00:38:41,918
a peek behind the curtain.

617
00:38:41,999 --> 00:38:43,999
When you get a peek

618
00:38:43,999 --> 00:38:46,999
and you have suspicion it doesn't make

619
00:38:46,999 --> 00:38:50,999
When that moment happens you start

620
00:38:51,626 --> 00:38:54,999
If I'm on the other side and I'm

621
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:57,999
I would teach you to do

622
00:38:57,999 --> 00:39:00,083
is a director so obviously

623
00:39:00,083 --> 00:39:03,459
is a deception you know somebody

624
00:39:03,459 --> 00:39:06,999
a big thing, to identify

625
00:39:07,125 --> 00:39:10,667
This is what I would teach

626
00:39:10,667 --> 00:39:14,375
so if you see behind the curtain it's

627
00:39:14,375 --> 00:39:18,083
plausible reason why that happened

628
00:39:18,083 --> 00:39:20,417
anybody know who that is?

629
00:39:21,167 --> 00:39:23,209
He stole the Eiffel Tower?

630
00:39:23,209 --> 00:39:24,209
Twice!

631
00:39:24,209 --> 00:39:25,999
He stole the Brooklyn Bridge.

632
00:39:29,751 --> 00:39:31,999
He was arrogant when

633
00:39:31,999 --> 00:39:33,918
to prison

634
00:39:33,918 --> 00:39:36,876
they said, how are you going

635
00:39:36,876 --> 00:39:39,667
in San Francisco, and I said,

636
00:39:39,667 --> 00:39:42,667
to see it," and they said,

637
00:39:42,667 --> 00:39:45,292
"I'm not going to be here tomorrow."

638
00:39:50,334 --> 00:39:52,834
He picked

639
00:39:52,834 --> 00:39:56,459
suspicious about, and he made

640
00:39:56,459 --> 00:39:58,999
climbed out of the window,

641
00:39:58,999 --> 00:40:02,501
to be cleaning windows so when

642
00:40:02,501 --> 00:40:06,999
they thought it was

643
00:40:08,542 --> 00:40:11,375
He was a master of human nature.

644
00:40:11,375 --> 00:40:14,417
He understood how

645
00:40:15,083 --> 00:40:20,751
When our mind sees things in reality,

646
00:40:20,751 --> 00:40:26,209
if it is, I'll encode it, if it's not,

647
00:40:26,209 --> 00:40:27,999
about it.

648
00:40:28,292 --> 00:40:30,209
If you can decipher what makes things

649
00:40:30,209 --> 00:40:33,999
to the person you can make things

650
00:40:33,999 --> 00:40:35,999
You can make them not perceive them.

651
00:40:35,999 --> 00:40:37,999
Great example

652
00:40:37,999 --> 00:40:40,999
he was selling the Effel Tower,

653
00:40:40,999 --> 00:40:42,626
of junk metal.

654
00:40:42,751 --> 00:40:44,709
How are we doing on time?

655
00:40:47,751 --> 00:40:50,792
Finish the story.

656
00:40:50,792 --> 00:40:51,999
APOLLO: I'll wrap it up.

657
00:40:51,999 --> 00:40:52,999
All right.

658
00:40:52,999 --> 00:40:56,999
When he was selling the Tower,

659
00:40:56,999 --> 00:41:02,999
that Victor might not be who he said

660
00:41:02,999 --> 00:41:04,459
He had a variety

661
00:41:04,459 --> 00:41:07,834
on the job but this wife smelled the rat,

662
00:41:07,834 --> 00:41:09,834
behind the curtain.

663
00:41:09,834 --> 00:41:12,834
The way he dealt with that was

664
00:41:12,834 --> 00:41:15,751
he had dinner with them he said

665
00:41:15,751 --> 00:41:18,959
to happen you're going to need

666
00:41:18,959 --> 00:41:23,501
she thinks that's the rat she smells,

667
00:41:24,999 --> 00:41:28,918
They hate him but they say all right

668
00:41:28,918 --> 00:41:32,292
they go to buy the contract and

669
00:41:32,292 --> 00:41:34,709
to keep

670
00:41:34,709 --> 00:41:37,083
than he planned

671
00:41:37,083 --> 00:41:39,751
to identify what she needed.

672
00:41:39,834 --> 00:41:42,999
That's an example

673
00:41:43,083 --> 00:41:44,209
Any questions?

674
00:41:44,209 --> 00:41:46,999
Guys, we want to thank Apollo

675
00:41:46,999 --> 00:41:48,334
APOLLO: Thank you, guys.

676
00:41:48,334 --> 00:41:49,584
(Applause.) Thank you.

677
00:41:49,584 --> 00:41:49,584
We're going to try to get Apollo

678
00:41:49,584 --> 00:41:49,584
on his schedule, not today, to more

679
00:41:49,584 --> 00:41:49,584
if you have questions that you want

680
00:41:49,584 --> 00:41:49,584
to us and when we get Apollo on we

681
00:41:49,584 --> 00:41:50,751
and get them answered.

682
00:41:50,751 --> 00:41:50,751
