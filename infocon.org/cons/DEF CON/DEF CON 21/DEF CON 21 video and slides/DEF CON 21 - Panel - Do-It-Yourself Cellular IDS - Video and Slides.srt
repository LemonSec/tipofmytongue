1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,999
Hi, everybody.

2
00:00:01,999 --> 00:00:05,999
Welcome

3
00:00:05,999 --> 00:00:07,000
intrusion detection.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,999
This is Scott Fretheim,

5
00:00:09,999 --> 00:00:12,375
we're from LMG Security.

6
00:00:14,626 --> 00:00:15,999
(Applause).

7
00:00:18,125 --> 00:00:21,918
So if your cell phone were hacked,

8
00:00:21,999 --> 00:00:24,999
Probably half of you today

9
00:00:24,999 --> 00:00:27,292
hacked, but you can't tell.

10
00:00:27,292 --> 00:00:28,999
You can pick it up and look at it.

11
00:00:29,125 --> 00:00:30,250
The video that you see

12
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:34,125
and I don't know why it's not displaying

13
00:00:34,125 --> 00:00:36,876
The video displayed on the screen

14
00:00:36,876 --> 00:00:41,459
a video that's infected

15
00:00:41,999 --> 00:00:45,999
It's sending data out to the Netherlands.

16
00:00:51,999 --> 00:00:55,876
If you were a user looking at this phone,

17
00:00:57,250 --> 00:01:01,709
There's been an explosion

18
00:01:01,709 --> 00:01:04,999
I don't know if you have seen

19
00:01:04,999 --> 00:01:08,375
It was very good, very interesting

20
00:01:08,375 --> 00:01:11,999
the number

21
00:01:11,999 --> 00:01:15,542
between March 2012 and March 2013.

22
00:01:17,083 --> 00:01:19,918
It's teeny, tiny little computers.

23
00:01:20,292 --> 00:01:23,083
They can record you and track you

24
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:26,459
And they can do anything that you can

25
00:01:26,584 --> 00:01:28,501
This is a screen shot of Tigerbot.

26
00:01:30,918 --> 00:01:34,417
It is record the surrounding audio

27
00:01:34,918 --> 00:01:38,999
It can also track your GPS location

28
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:43,334
I think it's really cool and sort

29
00:01:43,334 --> 00:01:47,083
because you can have botnets

30
00:01:47,083 --> 00:01:50,417
on normal LANs and soon we're also

31
00:01:50,417 --> 00:01:52,999
of infected smartphones.

32
00:01:52,999 --> 00:01:55,792
When they came

33
00:01:55,792 --> 00:02:00,999
attackers can segment that

34
00:02:00,999 --> 00:02:04,501
So you have nodes communicating

35
00:02:04,501 --> 00:02:07,999
If you have ten infected systems

36
00:02:07,999 --> 00:02:11,250
they are communicating

37
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:15,834
and that means

38
00:02:15,999 --> 00:02:20,751
An attacker will be able

39
00:02:20,751 --> 00:02:23,417
And they will be able

40
00:02:23,417 --> 00:02:27,999
in and segment them

41
00:02:27,999 --> 00:02:31,792
You can say I have ten infected bots

42
00:02:31,792 --> 00:02:34,250
of Defense building.

43
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:35,834
I have 20 infected bots

44
00:02:35,834 --> 00:02:38,083
how much do you want them?

45
00:02:38,083 --> 00:02:41,375
Maybe they are worth different amounts

46
00:02:41,751 --> 00:02:46,417
Mobile malware can record surrounding

47
00:02:46,417 --> 00:02:49,999
and send out your contacts list

48
00:02:49,999 --> 00:02:53,292
is something that we

49
00:02:53,292 --> 00:02:56,959
in doing so, they get more lists

50
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:59,292
the same way the Spam.

51
00:02:59,292 --> 00:03:02,209
We will probably get

52
00:03:03,626 --> 00:03:05,375
You can of course,

53
00:03:05,375 --> 00:03:09,959
and key strokes and control your phone

54
00:03:11,417 --> 00:03:14,501
This is a chart that we made using

55
00:03:14,501 --> 00:03:19,459
of the phone home traffic

56
00:03:19,459 --> 00:03:20,959
This is an infected laptop.

57
00:03:20,999 --> 00:03:23,834
It reflects

58
00:03:23,834 --> 00:03:26,292
to the attacker's system.

59
00:03:26,292 --> 00:03:28,375
This was over a 24 hour period.

60
00:03:28,459 --> 00:03:31,959
All the normal windows traffic has been

61
00:03:31,959 --> 00:03:33,709
home to systems.

62
00:03:33,709 --> 00:03:36,250
Actually, I think first it phoned home

63
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:37,999
IP addresses.

64
00:03:37,999 --> 00:03:39,792
You can see that little blip there.

65
00:03:39,792 --> 00:03:42,334
And it started talking

66
00:03:42,999 --> 00:03:45,999
The same thing happens

67
00:03:46,209 --> 00:03:47,876
The Android Stels malware.

68
00:03:49,125 --> 00:03:52,292
It phoned home everybody 15 minutes.

69
00:03:52,292 --> 00:03:53,709
So would you see

70
00:03:53,709 --> 00:03:57,751
to this with your smartphone and

71
00:03:58,999 --> 00:04:02,209
Now, on LANs,

72
00:04:02,209 --> 00:04:05,918
the option of inspecting network traffic.

73
00:04:05,918 --> 00:04:07,876
They can make charts like that.

74
00:04:07,876 --> 00:04:09,751
So even

75
00:04:09,751 --> 00:04:14,083
installed on a laptop, we can still tell

76
00:04:14,083 --> 00:04:16,792
on the patterns

77
00:04:16,792 --> 00:04:18,626
on the network.

78
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:22,292
We don't have that same option

79
00:04:22,292 --> 00:04:25,751
within our enterprises and that means

80
00:04:25,751 --> 00:04:29,542
in meetings having their audio recorded

81
00:04:29,542 --> 00:04:33,209
corporate information on them,

82
00:04:33,209 --> 00:04:34,999
is also true.

83
00:04:34,999 --> 00:04:36,834
You might be sitting

84
00:04:36,834 --> 00:04:40,250
and never know it or having your

85
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:44,250
the ability to inspect your traffic to tell

86
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:46,334
an attacker, whether it's

87
00:04:46,334 --> 00:04:48,542
is collecting information

88
00:04:48,542 --> 00:04:50,834
and sending it outbound.

89
00:04:51,167 --> 00:04:53,999
The problem is that cellular traffic

90
00:04:53,999 --> 00:04:58,751
to the key stakeholders who really care

91
00:04:58,999 --> 00:05:01,999
One of the folks in our last talk asked

92
00:05:01,999 --> 00:05:04,999
if their phone was infected

93
00:05:04,999 --> 00:05:09,125
if they were inspecting that traffic,

94
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:13,292
to be able to chase

95
00:05:13,292 --> 00:05:14,459
Nobody cares

96
00:05:14,459 --> 00:05:16,751
as you do, unfortunately.

97
00:05:18,834 --> 00:05:20,999
So what is the solution?

98
00:05:21,334 --> 00:05:24,999
We propose

99
00:05:24,999 --> 00:05:27,999
Within the past few years,

100
00:05:27,999 --> 00:05:32,626
little femtocell, miniature bay stations,

101
00:05:32,626 --> 00:05:35,999
in places you might otherwise have

102
00:05:35,999 --> 00:05:37,959
They are being marketed

103
00:05:37,959 --> 00:05:40,459
You can get one

104
00:05:40,459 --> 00:05:42,542
Your cell phone connects

105
00:05:42,542 --> 00:05:46,959
across the Internet back

106
00:05:47,125 --> 00:05:49,626
In this case, we were playing

107
00:05:49,626 --> 00:05:51,667
Samsung femtocells.

108
00:05:51,667 --> 00:05:54,667
They are fairly inexpensive this entire

109
00:05:54,667 --> 00:05:58,667
a cellular intrusion detection system

110
00:05:58,918 --> 00:06:01,334
We used both

111
00:06:01,334 --> 00:06:07,751
the SCS 26UC4 and it would probably

112
00:06:07,959 --> 00:06:10,918
Our goal is to enable defenders

113
00:06:10,918 --> 00:06:14,999
to detect when our cell phone

114
00:06:14,999 --> 00:06:17,501
are monitoring our traffic.

115
00:06:20,083 --> 00:06:23,459
So we gained route

116
00:06:23,459 --> 00:06:27,792
and then we modified

117
00:06:27,792 --> 00:06:31,459
so that it started exporting traffic.

118
00:06:31,459 --> 00:06:34,375
And David will go into this

119
00:06:34,375 --> 00:06:36,250
Then we sent it

120
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:40,209
which embarrassingly only cost us $44

121
00:06:40,209 --> 00:06:44,834
an old dealt Optiplex and it was running

122
00:06:47,292 --> 00:06:50,584
When we infected a phone

123
00:06:50,584 --> 00:06:52,999
Snort would alert on it.

124
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:57,083
The roadmap today, number one,

125
00:06:57,083 --> 00:07:01,959
through the femtocell modification

126
00:07:01,999 --> 00:07:06,292
We will show you examples

127
00:07:06,292 --> 00:07:08,999
We used some interesting stuff

128
00:07:08,999 --> 00:07:10,834
We will do a demonstration?

129
00:07:10,834 --> 00:07:12,999
Which we actually boot

130
00:07:12,999 --> 00:07:15,417
gets modified in realtime.

131
00:07:15,417 --> 00:07:18,083
And then we'll show you a little video

132
00:07:18,083 --> 00:07:21,501
in which we infected a phone

133
00:07:21,501 --> 00:07:24,959
captured the traffic and used

134
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:26,999
the alerts pop up.

135
00:07:27,334 --> 00:07:31,125
And then we'll go

136
00:07:31,125 --> 00:07:37,125
and finally Scott and Randi Price did

137
00:07:37,125 --> 00:07:39,876
And she will show how it corroborated

138
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:43,918
and Scott Fretheim will show how

139
00:07:43,918 --> 00:07:45,959
and controlled it.

140
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:47,209
We have a lot to cram in here.

141
00:07:47,209 --> 00:07:49,918
There's also

142
00:07:49,918 --> 00:07:50,999
It's 77 pages.

143
00:07:50,999 --> 00:07:52,083
Lots of information

144
00:07:52,083 --> 00:07:55,709
afterwards LMGsecurity.com/blog.

145
00:07:57,959 --> 00:07:59,459
So who are we?

146
00:07:59,459 --> 00:08:00,999
We are LMG Security.

147
00:08:00,999 --> 00:08:03,876
We are a security consulting

148
00:08:03,876 --> 00:08:06,501
We kind of support our research habit

149
00:08:06,501 --> 00:08:08,667
We do penetration testing,

150
00:08:08,667 --> 00:08:11,083
digital forensics and more.

151
00:08:11,167 --> 00:08:15,125
We also teach

152
00:08:15,125 --> 00:08:17,918
And that's where the idea

153
00:08:19,626 --> 00:08:23,125
Mobile network forensics, that's

154
00:08:23,125 --> 00:08:25,584
Let's grab some packet captures

155
00:08:25,584 --> 00:08:27,959
it and write a class about it.

156
00:08:27,959 --> 00:08:30,334
It turns out it was not so easy.

157
00:08:30,334 --> 00:08:33,209
It's really hard to get access

158
00:08:33,209 --> 00:08:34,999
If you have $300,000 to spend,

159
00:08:34,999 --> 00:08:37,999
telecommunications equipment,

160
00:08:37,999 --> 00:08:40,125
for most of us out there.

161
00:08:41,999 --> 00:08:45,125
Our core project team, myself, I'm

162
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:47,584
consultant and the author

163
00:08:47,584 --> 00:08:50,334
tracking hackers through cyberspace.

164
00:08:50,334 --> 00:08:52,209
David is our lead research scientist

165
00:08:52,209 --> 00:08:55,334
is our certified forensic examiner

166
00:08:55,334 --> 00:08:58,083
of our penetration tester team.

167
00:08:58,167 --> 00:09:01,667
I want to give a big shout

168
00:09:01,667 --> 00:09:04,167
to use some of your items.

169
00:09:08,125 --> 00:09:10,083
This is parts list.

170
00:09:12,834 --> 00:09:14,999
First, you need a femtocell.

171
00:09:14,999 --> 00:09:15,999
You can get it used.

172
00:09:15,999 --> 00:09:19,999
The one that we used

173
00:09:19,999 --> 00:09:28,083
We had a dell Optiplex GX260,

174
00:09:28,083 --> 00:09:29,999
Obviously if you want to,

175
00:09:29,999 --> 00:09:32,918
but that was totally fine

176
00:09:32,999 --> 00:09:34,083
We had a hub.

177
00:09:34,083 --> 00:09:35,626
A hub is really nice to have.

178
00:09:35,792 --> 00:09:37,626
It's a real hub, an old hub.

179
00:09:37,834 --> 00:09:40,209
More valuable than switches

180
00:09:40,209 --> 00:09:42,709
on the wire a lot easier.

181
00:09:42,918 --> 00:09:47,501
We have an FTID friend and that lets

182
00:09:47,501 --> 00:09:51,501
on the femtocell and a couple

183
00:09:51,501 --> 00:09:54,626
which we'll talk about today.

184
00:09:56,167 --> 00:09:58,999
So a little introduction

185
00:09:58,999 --> 00:10:01,125
is what we will focus on.

186
00:10:01,459 --> 00:10:04,999
It came to the public attention

187
00:10:04,999 --> 00:10:06,042
So just a few months ago.

188
00:10:06,125 --> 00:10:09,417
And it's distributed by Spam email.

189
00:10:09,417 --> 00:10:10,626
People click on a link.

190
00:10:10,626 --> 00:10:14,999
The one that Dell wrote their paper

191
00:10:16,292 --> 00:10:18,999
So it's distributed

192
00:10:18,999 --> 00:10:20,999
as other malware.

193
00:10:20,999 --> 00:10:23,334
Normally they use

194
00:10:23,334 --> 00:10:27,125
but that doesn't work

195
00:10:27,125 --> 00:10:29,999
They are using

196
00:10:31,375 --> 00:10:34,417
You click on the link and it says, sorry,

197
00:10:34,417 --> 00:10:38,999
of Adobe Flash player to read this file,

198
00:10:40,751 --> 00:10:44,584
And the user walks

199
00:10:44,667 --> 00:10:47,167
Stels is capable

200
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:51,375
and also filtering and intercepting SMS

201
00:10:51,375 --> 00:10:53,125
This isn't this isn't surprising

202
00:10:53,125 --> 00:10:56,459
since banks started coming

203
00:10:56,459 --> 00:10:58,834
like you go to log

204
00:10:58,834 --> 00:11:02,876
and sometimes it will send you a PIN

205
00:11:03,167 --> 00:11:05,834
If an attacker has

206
00:11:05,834 --> 00:11:08,083
into that web page

207
00:11:08,083 --> 00:11:11,959
in the browser attack and ask you

208
00:11:14,125 --> 00:11:17,209
You type in your phone number

209
00:11:17,209 --> 00:11:19,709
from that point on,

210
00:11:19,709 --> 00:11:21,375
to your phone.

211
00:11:21,375 --> 00:11:24,167
So they can grab those PINs

212
00:11:27,125 --> 00:11:29,959
So they can link them

213
00:11:29,959 --> 00:11:32,459
they gain

214
00:11:32,459 --> 00:11:35,667
can't see some of them,

215
00:11:35,667 --> 00:11:38,417
to if someone is trying to get

216
00:11:38,417 --> 00:11:41,375
because it would be funny for you

217
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:44,999
a text message with the PIN

218
00:11:44,999 --> 00:11:46,918
trying to log in.

219
00:11:46,918 --> 00:11:48,999
They filter that so you can't see it.

220
00:11:48,999 --> 00:11:51,209
It can make phone calls

221
00:11:51,209 --> 00:11:53,709
to premium numbers.

222
00:11:53,709 --> 00:11:56,834
Again, direct financial incentive

223
00:11:56,999 --> 00:11:59,334
It can also update itself.

224
00:11:59,334 --> 00:12:01,334
Any behavior we don't see

225
00:12:01,334 --> 00:12:04,292
they could totally add tomorrow.

226
00:12:04,292 --> 00:12:05,542
The behavior

227
00:12:05,542 --> 00:12:08,375
change overnight

228
00:12:10,667 --> 00:12:13,584
This is our RF shielded cage.

229
00:12:13,584 --> 00:12:15,250
As we were doing this,

230
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:18,292
with legal counsel extensively

231
00:12:18,292 --> 00:12:23,167
to make sure that no one else's cell

232
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:27,083
as they were taking these packet

233
00:12:27,083 --> 00:12:28,292
This device

234
00:12:28,292 --> 00:12:30,876
in our cell phone forensic lab.

235
00:12:30,876 --> 00:12:36,542
We have the only shielded case

236
00:12:36,542 --> 00:12:39,125
David, do you want to talk

237
00:12:42,209 --> 00:12:47,209
DAVID HARRISON: Let's talk

238
00:12:47,709 --> 00:12:50,542
So the RF shielded cage here,

239
00:12:50,542 --> 00:12:53,542
out of an abundance

240
00:12:53,542 --> 00:12:56,999
up accidentally capturing your traffic.

241
00:12:57,250 --> 00:13:02,999
Now, these femtocell can be configured

242
00:13:03,542 --> 00:13:04,999
But in addition,

243
00:13:04,999 --> 00:13:08,626
an absolute guarantee that we wouldn't

244
00:13:08,626 --> 00:13:10,334
that wasn't ours.

245
00:13:10,334 --> 00:13:14,584
So on the side of this box here,

246
00:13:14,584 --> 00:13:17,209
of configurable ports.

247
00:13:17,375 --> 00:13:21,250
The first of which is currently set

248
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:26,999
a filtered ethernet jack

249
00:13:26,999 --> 00:13:28,999
We then have sorry.

250
00:13:28,999 --> 00:13:30,999
We then have

251
00:13:30,999 --> 00:13:37,250
to the FTID frim that's inside that we

252
00:13:37,626 --> 00:13:42,999
We also added on the instructions

253
00:13:42,999 --> 00:13:46,751
Ramsey, added

254
00:13:46,751 --> 00:13:48,209
GPS in.

255
00:13:48,209 --> 00:13:52,292
One of the requirements is and one

256
00:13:52,292 --> 00:13:56,999
in inside the middle of a hotel

257
00:13:56,999 --> 00:13:59,999
for the femtocell to boot up.

258
00:14:00,125 --> 00:14:03,999
So we had to run a GPS signal

259
00:14:04,083 --> 00:14:09,876
Let's see, so what's our setup look

260
00:14:09,876 --> 00:14:12,999
This is the other side

261
00:14:12,999 --> 00:14:14,999
of those ports.

262
00:14:14,999 --> 00:14:19,834
We have the GPS antenna,

263
00:14:19,834 --> 00:14:26,167
the USB cable running

264
00:14:26,167 --> 00:14:29,250
And then we have

265
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:35,292
to an HDMI cable where Samsung put

266
00:14:35,292 --> 00:14:40,417
of an HDMI two pins

267
00:14:40,417 --> 00:14:42,626
of the thing.

268
00:14:42,999 --> 00:14:45,334
You can also see we have power

269
00:14:45,667 --> 00:14:47,667
Let's see.

270
00:14:47,999 --> 00:14:50,459
So cellular intrusion detection.

271
00:14:51,083 --> 00:14:55,459
This wasn't originally

272
00:14:55,459 --> 00:14:59,999
we were looking at network forensics,

273
00:14:59,999 --> 00:15:03,083
about the the cellular network.

274
00:15:03,459 --> 00:15:09,250
And it quickly became this big project

275
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:12,334
So as soon as we did get access,

276
00:15:12,334 --> 00:15:13,626
What can we do?

277
00:15:13,626 --> 00:15:18,542
And we thought, here's something cool,

278
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:20,626
We can hook it up to Snort.

279
00:15:20,999 --> 00:15:24,083
This is just going

280
00:15:24,083 --> 00:15:28,792
at some level, we assumed at least,

281
00:15:29,083 --> 00:15:31,542
Let's hook it

282
00:15:31,542 --> 00:15:34,999
find, if we can see

283
00:15:34,999 --> 00:15:37,125
and control traffic.

284
00:15:38,834 --> 00:15:41,959
So when we first got root access

285
00:15:41,959 --> 00:15:45,292
will step how we got root access

286
00:15:45,417 --> 00:15:47,999
We hooked up TCP dump to it.

287
00:15:47,999 --> 00:15:50,584
It has a copy of TCP dump.

288
00:15:50,999 --> 00:15:54,083
The box itself

289
00:15:54,083 --> 00:16:00,834
of Linux called Monta Vista and so, like,

290
00:16:00,834 --> 00:16:05,417
It turns out, of course, everything

291
00:16:05,417 --> 00:16:10,083
an IPsec tunnel back

292
00:16:10,083 --> 00:16:16,918
and just running TCP dump gets us you

293
00:16:16,918 --> 00:16:20,250
and not so useful to us.

294
00:16:20,626 --> 00:16:26,501
To step backwards how did we get root

295
00:16:26,501 --> 00:16:29,959
On the bottom, there's an HDMI port.

296
00:16:30,083 --> 00:16:38,375
It has 3.3 volt console access

297
00:16:39,959 --> 00:16:45,083
We hooked that up to an FTDI friend,

298
00:16:45,918 --> 00:16:49,626
It was a $15 part or something.

299
00:16:51,209 --> 00:16:54,334
I got really antsy while we waited

300
00:16:54,334 --> 00:16:58,292
of this and it was right

301
00:16:58,542 --> 00:17:02,250
So I just grabbed my badge

302
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:06,999
an FTDI connector on, it I ended

303
00:17:07,417 --> 00:17:09,459
It's a little bit

304
00:17:09,459 --> 00:17:11,999
but I thought you would enjoy that.

305
00:17:12,334 --> 00:17:20,083
So as soon as we got console access,

306
00:17:20,083 --> 00:17:25,083
of the stack is a Uboot boot loader.

307
00:17:25,459 --> 00:17:28,709
Samsung has done a bit to modify

308
00:17:34,083 --> 00:17:36,999
You can go to their website

309
00:17:37,083 --> 00:17:43,999
And in the old versions and old being

310
00:17:43,999 --> 00:17:49,709
January or February of this year,

311
00:17:49,709 --> 00:17:53,626
the boot process was

312
00:17:53,626 --> 00:17:56,999
you would type sys return.

313
00:17:57,999 --> 00:18:07,083
The thing is the code for that was

314
00:18:07,083 --> 00:18:09,083
And we actually didn't figure that out.

315
00:18:09,083 --> 00:18:12,209
That was another gentlemen,

316
00:18:12,209 --> 00:18:16,959
in our white paper, linked

317
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:20,542
So we took that and, okay,

318
00:18:23,083 --> 00:18:30,667
So then we just did init equals NSH

319
00:18:30,667 --> 00:18:39,250
through the boot up process manually,

320
00:18:39,876 --> 00:18:45,667
We then started looking

321
00:18:45,667 --> 00:18:48,292
We saw there's DHCP going on,

322
00:18:48,292 --> 00:18:50,959
about a little bit ago.

323
00:18:51,999 --> 00:18:54,501
And it has IP tables.

324
00:18:54,501 --> 00:18:57,999
It's using that to filter

325
00:18:57,999 --> 00:19:02,792
addresses can connect to some

326
00:19:02,792 --> 00:19:06,334
since we saw TCP dump wasn't

327
00:19:06,334 --> 00:19:10,334
Let's see if we can get access

328
00:19:10,918 --> 00:19:15,999
That was a good enough idea,

329
00:19:15,999 --> 00:19:19,626
on there

330
00:19:19,626 --> 00:19:21,999
of IP tables 137.

331
00:19:22,083 --> 00:19:28,209
No NF queue, no way to copy

332
00:19:28,209 --> 00:19:30,626
There's not even

333
00:19:30,626 --> 00:19:31,959
It's an embedded system.

334
00:19:31,959 --> 00:19:33,083
It's not that surprising.

335
00:19:33,083 --> 00:19:35,334
So he went back

336
00:19:35,334 --> 00:19:38,751
and we really wanted to use NFqueue.

337
00:19:38,751 --> 00:19:42,501
We grabbed the source code

338
00:19:42,751 --> 00:19:45,083
However, it doesn't want

339
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:47,999
with modern versions of GCC.

340
00:19:49,999 --> 00:19:52,999
So it's really picky

341
00:19:52,999 --> 00:19:56,667
with Monta Vista's armed tool chain.

342
00:19:56,999 --> 00:19:59,083
Now, that encountered

343
00:19:59,083 --> 00:20:01,959
which was that Monta Vista doesn't

344
00:20:01,959 --> 00:20:05,417
despite everything being GPL licensed.

345
00:20:05,417 --> 00:20:07,999
They don't openly distribute that.

346
00:20:07,999 --> 00:20:12,999
They only distribute their tool chain

347
00:20:12,999 --> 00:20:17,918
however, one of the customers

348
00:20:17,918 --> 00:20:23,709
the OMAP series of boards,

349
00:20:23,709 --> 00:20:27,999
So the OMAP,

350
00:20:27,999 --> 00:20:34,709
uses the same version

351
00:20:34,709 --> 00:20:37,292
The chip set in here is actually

352
00:20:37,292 --> 00:20:41,417
is a very similar Texas Instruments

353
00:20:42,751 --> 00:20:49,042
You can grab the tool chain

354
00:20:49,042 --> 00:20:52,125
We used that to then build

355
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:56,292
all of the dependencies

356
00:20:57,999 --> 00:21:01,999
And what NFqueue does,

357
00:21:01,999 --> 00:21:04,542
it pulls packets out.

358
00:21:04,542 --> 00:21:11,250
It routes them with the rule in IP tables,

359
00:21:11,999 --> 00:21:17,083
Then you have a user space program,

360
00:21:17,083 --> 00:21:21,167
mark it as do whatever you want

361
00:21:21,167 --> 00:21:22,999
You can modify it, send it back.

362
00:21:22,999 --> 00:21:26,083
In this case, we are just marking it

363
00:21:26,083 --> 00:21:30,292
Sending it back and then sending

364
00:21:30,292 --> 00:21:33,999
will then pipe

365
00:21:33,999 --> 00:21:35,959
in a minute.

366
00:21:36,834 --> 00:21:40,584
Oh, yes, here's

367
00:21:40,999 --> 00:21:42,999
Kernel modules.

368
00:21:44,542 --> 00:21:46,083
IP tables.

369
00:21:46,083 --> 00:21:48,792
So we wrote

370
00:21:48,792 --> 00:21:52,083
compiled statically

371
00:21:52,083 --> 00:21:56,334
the packets out of the queue,

372
00:21:59,083 --> 00:22:03,501
This is an ARM926EJ processor what

373
00:22:03,501 --> 00:22:10,999
rather than dealing with cross compiler,

374
00:22:13,125 --> 00:22:19,709
You don't want to cross compile

375
00:22:21,083 --> 00:22:25,292
So the Netcat, we wanted

376
00:22:25,292 --> 00:22:27,999
as quickly as possible.

377
00:22:27,999 --> 00:22:29,375
It doesn't have much power.

378
00:22:29,375 --> 00:22:30,626
It's a pain to work with.

379
00:22:30,626 --> 00:22:35,459
Word to the wise, if you do this, there

380
00:22:35,459 --> 00:22:37,375
to sig term.

381
00:22:37,626 --> 00:22:44,083
Don't run ping, without a count

382
00:22:44,125 --> 00:22:48,999
I was like, oh, my God, I really want

383
00:22:48,999 --> 00:22:52,459
as possible, send it to Netcat

384
00:22:52,459 --> 00:22:55,918
of our processing

385
00:22:55,918 --> 00:22:58,250
that old Dell Optiplex.

386
00:22:58,250 --> 00:23:02,459
So we can see on the other end,

387
00:23:02,459 --> 00:23:08,999
a Netcat listener which pipes

388
00:23:08,999 --> 00:23:14,375
program that leverages Skapy

389
00:23:14,375 --> 00:23:19,999
as a hexadecimal stream

390
00:23:19,999 --> 00:23:23,999
which we then write to a file.

391
00:23:23,999 --> 00:23:27,999
And hey, lo and behold,

392
00:23:28,167 --> 00:23:30,334
And then we looked at that traffic.

393
00:23:30,334 --> 00:23:31,334
(Laughter).

394
00:23:31,334 --> 00:23:33,167
And let's let Sherri talk about that.

395
00:23:33,167 --> 00:23:36,250
SHERRI DAVIDOFF: It took us

396
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:39,876
to get to this point where we had traffic.

397
00:23:39,876 --> 00:23:41,417
We were a little bit slowed down.

398
00:23:41,417 --> 00:23:43,834
We started the project in August and

399
00:23:43,834 --> 00:23:46,542
all of this and we were just

400
00:23:46,542 --> 00:23:50,918
and start collecting packets when

401
00:23:51,125 --> 00:23:54,417
We had to break back into the system.

402
00:23:55,959 --> 00:23:59,999
We did figure out how to do that

403
00:23:59,999 --> 00:24:01,876
By the time we were able

404
00:24:01,876 --> 00:24:03,792
it was around May.

405
00:24:03,999 --> 00:24:07,542
When we finally got it, it was beautiful!

406
00:24:07,999 --> 00:24:11,167
So this is the first

407
00:24:11,167 --> 00:24:13,834
to show you

408
00:24:13,834 --> 00:24:16,083
hierarchy summary.

409
00:24:16,417 --> 00:24:20,709
You can see here, this is just

410
00:24:20,709 --> 00:24:23,751
There's 82.04%

411
00:24:23,751 --> 00:24:29,250
normal traffic that you might expect

412
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:34,167
So NTP, SNMP, DNS, that kind of stuff.

413
00:24:34,167 --> 00:24:38,542
You scroll down, okay, you start

414
00:24:38,542 --> 00:24:39,709
That's .21%.

415
00:24:39,959 --> 00:24:42,999
I was pretty intrigued

416
00:24:42,999 --> 00:24:47,959
in there and then we start getting

417
00:24:47,999 --> 00:24:48,999
There's GRE.

418
00:24:48,999 --> 00:24:51,584
So that's used

419
00:24:51,584 --> 00:24:56,125
from the femtocell

420
00:24:56,542 --> 00:25:01,751
And then you see I don't know

421
00:25:01,751 --> 00:25:03,999
in PPP in GRE.

422
00:25:04,417 --> 00:25:05,417
Okay.

423
00:25:05,417 --> 00:25:06,417
I can handle that.

424
00:25:06,459 --> 00:25:07,999
Here's the next screen.

425
00:25:07,999 --> 00:25:08,999
(Laughter).

426
00:25:08,999 --> 00:25:12,167
All right.

427
00:25:12,167 --> 00:25:16,999
So we have TCP IP within IPv4,

428
00:25:17,083 --> 00:25:21,292
So this is where your web traffic lives

429
00:25:22,375 --> 00:25:26,209
In some cases Wireshark can dissect

430
00:25:26,209 --> 00:25:30,542
of the higher layer traffic

431
00:25:30,584 --> 00:25:37,584
You see TCP in IPv4 and PPPE

432
00:25:40,999 --> 00:25:42,083
(Laughter).

433
00:25:47,834 --> 00:25:50,459
I don't know how far this rabbit hole

434
00:25:50,459 --> 00:25:52,709
Just kept going and going and going.

435
00:25:53,751 --> 00:25:57,209
So David didn't believe that this was

436
00:25:57,209 --> 00:25:59,417
DAVID HARRISON: I just figured it

437
00:25:59,417 --> 00:26:01,792
in Wireshark or something.

438
00:26:01,792 --> 00:26:02,918
SHERRI DAVIDOFF: So

439
00:26:02,918 --> 00:26:04,584
of these packets.

440
00:26:04,584 --> 00:26:05,584
This is an example.

441
00:26:05,667 --> 00:26:13,999
This is data in data in TCP in IPv4

442
00:26:13,999 --> 00:26:18,999
in PPP in GRE in IPv4 in a frame.

443
00:26:18,999 --> 00:26:21,999
DAVID HARRISON: Keep in mind,

444
00:26:21,999 --> 00:26:25,417
in iSEC tunnel and goes back

445
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:30,375
SHERRI DAVIDOFF: And I know

446
00:26:30,375 --> 00:26:32,999
on another phone.

447
00:26:32,999 --> 00:26:35,250
AUDIENCE MEMBER: It sounds

448
00:26:35,250 --> 00:26:36,999
DAVID HARRISON: Dr. Seuss, yep.

449
00:26:36,999 --> 00:26:42,999
SHERRI DAVIDOFF: Here's

450
00:26:43,876 --> 00:26:46,459
We will not dig into this stuff too much.

451
00:26:46,459 --> 00:26:47,876
It seems to be used

452
00:26:47,876 --> 00:26:50,292
between the femtocell and Verizon.

453
00:26:50,292 --> 00:26:52,999
So it will go out and this

454
00:26:52,999 --> 00:26:54,959
It will enter a password it

455
00:26:54,959 --> 00:26:58,292
down some configuration files,

456
00:26:58,292 --> 00:26:59,250
So I just thought that was kind

457
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:01,417
the reconstructed stream here.

458
00:27:04,626 --> 00:27:09,459
The phone does mobile handset

459
00:27:11,999 --> 00:27:15,083
We were able

460
00:27:15,083 --> 00:27:17,999
So that means that any time

461
00:27:17,999 --> 00:27:21,334
we have a little smart alert that pops up.

462
00:27:21,999 --> 00:27:24,125
The string that

463
00:27:24,125 --> 00:27:25,999
with is "welcome

464
00:27:25,999 --> 00:27:28,083
something, something."

465
00:27:28,667 --> 00:27:30,542
So you can tell as soon as there's

466
00:27:30,542 --> 00:27:32,999
to your femtocell, which is kind

467
00:27:32,999 --> 00:27:35,501
if you deploy it on your home network.

468
00:27:35,999 --> 00:27:40,999
And it can only to specific phones,

469
00:27:40,999 --> 00:27:44,999
if you are inspecting traffic, of course.

470
00:27:45,459 --> 00:27:50,626
So we also wrote

471
00:27:53,751 --> 00:27:56,083
Our efforts

472
00:27:56,083 --> 00:27:59,959
by the fact that Verizon doesn't seem

473
00:27:59,959 --> 00:28:01,876
of the standard.

474
00:28:01,876 --> 00:28:02,876
So we had to go digging

475
00:28:02,876 --> 00:28:06,375
out exactly which version

476
00:28:06,959 --> 00:28:10,125
This is an example

477
00:28:10,125 --> 00:28:12,999
dissecting an set up A9.

478
00:28:12,999 --> 00:28:15,834
So that's used to set

479
00:28:15,834 --> 00:28:18,250
to transfer user data.

480
00:28:18,250 --> 00:28:20,417
And this is available on Sourceforge.

481
00:28:20,417 --> 00:28:22,250
As soon as we get to a clean network,

482
00:28:22,250 --> 00:28:24,999
of us is home, we will upload this stuff.

483
00:28:28,667 --> 00:28:32,918
We ended up examining

484
00:28:32,918 --> 00:28:36,250
and that's

485
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:42,292
Android.Stels actually transmits signals

486
00:28:42,292 --> 00:28:45,083
So we wanted to pull

487
00:28:45,083 --> 00:28:48,542
and figure out how

488
00:28:48,626 --> 00:28:50,999
There were two kinds

489
00:28:50,999 --> 00:28:54,709
and Wireshark was dissecting them

490
00:28:54,709 --> 00:28:56,751
This was a default version of Wireshark.

491
00:28:56,751 --> 00:29:01,083
There was GRE type 8881, which

492
00:29:05,083 --> 00:29:08,083
This was used

493
00:29:08,125 --> 00:29:11,999
Wireshark didn't dissect this

494
00:29:12,209 --> 00:29:17,083
However, there were also GRE 88D2

495
00:29:17,083 --> 00:29:20,292
and Wireshark did decode more.

496
00:29:20,292 --> 00:29:21,999
It could get all the way up to TCP.

497
00:29:22,501 --> 00:29:25,417
It didn't get the HTTP in most cases.

498
00:29:25,792 --> 00:29:30,834
When we looked at first in Wireshark,

499
00:29:30,834 --> 00:29:35,667
and there was no matching outgoing

500
00:29:35,667 --> 00:29:38,918
to dissect with our eyeballs.

501
00:29:38,918 --> 00:29:41,751
That was a bit of a pain.

502
00:29:41,751 --> 00:29:46,584
I think I have to step down to be able

503
00:29:46,584 --> 00:29:50,083
DAVID HARRISON: Sorry,

504
00:29:50,125 --> 00:29:59,959
SHERRI DAVIDOFF: Okay.

505
00:29:59,959 --> 00:30:01,709
So here you see can everyone hear me.

506
00:30:01,876 --> 00:30:06,999
Here you see an GRE8881 packet

507
00:30:06,999 --> 00:30:09,999
dissects as far as that PPP.

508
00:30:09,999 --> 00:30:12,250
It doesn't dissect the IP or the TCP.

509
00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:16,334
So we started looking a little further

510
00:30:16,834 --> 00:30:19,626
Anybody in our network class

511
00:30:19,626 --> 00:30:21,125
the 4500 is?

512
00:30:21,999 --> 00:30:24,459
This should    AUDIENCE MEMBER:

513
00:30:24,459 --> 00:30:27,000
SHERRI DAVIDOFF: Yes, it's start

514
00:30:27,751 --> 00:30:29,918
It's IPv4.

515
00:30:29,918 --> 00:30:31,792
You will probably only see 4 or 6 there.

516
00:30:31,792 --> 00:30:36,999
The five represents the length,

517
00:30:37,417 --> 00:30:41,209
In this case, that's a 20

518
00:30:41,209 --> 00:30:44,584
of service field which you see 00.

519
00:30:44,584 --> 00:30:46,999
Any time you start looking

520
00:30:46,999 --> 00:30:51,209
you think maybe that's an IP packet

521
00:30:51,542 --> 00:30:53,999
We saw indeed it was.

522
00:30:53,999 --> 00:30:54,584
You could see

523
00:30:54,584 --> 00:30:56,709
the destination IP address.

524
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,876
For a ninja duck, what is hex 50.

525
00:31:03,501 --> 00:31:06,999
AUDIENCE MEMBER: 80.

526
00:31:08,709 --> 00:31:14,167
SHERRI DAVIDOFF: David,

527
00:31:14,167 --> 00:31:16,876
This was traffic that should be

528
00:31:16,876 --> 00:31:19,083
I'm not sure why Wireshark can't pick

529
00:31:19,083 --> 00:31:21,834
It can't get very far

530
00:31:21,834 --> 00:31:26,334
And then here's the 88d2 packets

531
00:31:28,083 --> 00:31:30,083
There's the IPv4.

532
00:31:30,083 --> 00:31:33,999
So it actually got it that time

533
00:31:33,999 --> 00:31:37,167
You can see inside,

534
00:31:37,167 --> 00:31:40,999
right here, HTTP, and higher layer stuff.

535
00:31:40,999 --> 00:31:42,209
It didn't get that far

536
00:31:42,209 --> 00:31:46,667
but it was useful that it could dissect

537
00:31:47,999 --> 00:31:52,999
So here's some threat indicators that

538
00:31:52,999 --> 00:31:55,999
for the Android Stels malware.

539
00:31:57,125 --> 00:32:03,167
You can see that it so Android.Stels has

540
00:32:03,167 --> 00:32:05,417
that are known.

541
00:32:05,667 --> 00:32:09,167
There's 31.170 something, something,

542
00:32:09,167 --> 00:32:13,999
actually and then the other one 95

543
00:32:13,999 --> 00:32:15,999
There's also

544
00:32:15,999 --> 00:32:19,375
is typically distributed, a flash player.

545
00:32:20,999 --> 00:32:24,584
And there's two domains that are

546
00:32:24,584 --> 00:32:29,083
the free IZ.com one and

547
00:32:29,083 --> 00:32:30,125
And those are

548
00:32:30,125 --> 00:32:32,083
into our Snort alerts.

549
00:32:32,999 --> 00:32:38,999
Here's some Snort alerts we used

550
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:44,083
We put the IP addresses in here.

551
00:32:44,083 --> 00:32:46,751
You can't just look for an IP address

552
00:32:46,751 --> 00:32:50,250
like for an IP address in an IP packet

553
00:32:50,459 --> 00:32:53,083
Snort can't dissect

554
00:32:53,083 --> 00:32:56,292
You have to look at it

555
00:32:57,501 --> 00:33:01,167
Hopefully that will pop

556
00:33:01,334 --> 00:33:03,918
Sometimes this can be fragmented

557
00:33:03,918 --> 00:33:07,083
but we found this actually worked most

558
00:33:08,918 --> 00:33:11,459
Same thing here,

559
00:33:11,459 --> 00:33:14,209
we have to look for it as a string

560
00:33:14,209 --> 00:33:17,417
because these are longer,

561
00:33:17,417 --> 00:33:19,959
up across multiple packets.

562
00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:23,083
We saw, in particular,

563
00:33:23,083 --> 00:33:27,167
containing this these domains,

564
00:33:27,167 --> 00:33:31,083
the domain was broken

565
00:33:31,083 --> 00:33:35,667
would show you there was I'm sorry,

566
00:33:35,667 --> 00:33:39,999
an alert on the response and not

567
00:33:41,918 --> 00:33:44,209
And then if you want to detect

568
00:33:44,209 --> 00:33:46,876
we can take a snippet of the binary

569
00:33:46,876 --> 00:33:49,501
on that and that worked really well.

570
00:33:49,999 --> 00:33:51,959
You can see

571
00:33:51,959 --> 00:33:54,792
themselves, you can see when

572
00:33:54,792 --> 00:33:56,375
Player update.

573
00:33:58,334 --> 00:34:01,250
So now we are going to do

574
00:34:01,626 --> 00:34:04,292
In our lab, I was the attacker.

575
00:34:04,834 --> 00:34:07,667
And the attacker can be any phone

576
00:34:07,667 --> 00:34:10,250
an AT&T smartphone that we used

577
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:12,999
from our Verizon phone and

578
00:34:12,999 --> 00:34:15,667
we sent a nasty text message.

579
00:34:15,667 --> 00:34:17,501
And David was the victim.

580
00:34:17,501 --> 00:34:19,083
DAVID HARRISON: Sad day.

581
00:34:19,083 --> 00:34:19,999
SHERRI DAVIDOFF: So

582
00:34:19,999 --> 00:34:23,999
a Verizon Android smartphone

583
00:34:24,250 --> 00:34:27,501
So now, let's switch over to our box.

584
00:34:27,501 --> 00:34:31,083
DAVID HARRISON: This

585
00:34:31,083 --> 00:34:34,209
SHERRI DAVIDOFF: Yes, we

586
00:34:35,334 --> 00:34:37,542
We need our lab coats hold on.

587
00:34:37,626 --> 00:34:40,334
DAVID HARRISON: Safety first.

588
00:34:40,709 --> 00:34:41,999
That's mine.

589
00:34:45,292 --> 00:34:47,417
Who buttoned this thing?

590
00:34:49,167 --> 00:34:51,626
Someone is trying to sabotage me!

591
00:34:58,999 --> 00:35:01,667
Sorry for switching, engineer.

592
00:35:01,667 --> 00:35:02,667
I know it's a pain.

593
00:35:02,667 --> 00:35:03,999
I used to do that for a living.

594
00:35:03,999 --> 00:35:05,459
SHERRI DAVIDOFF: Sorry.

595
00:35:10,709 --> 00:35:13,375
DAVID HARRISON: So all right.

596
00:35:13,375 --> 00:35:16,999
As soon as you okay.

597
00:35:16,999 --> 00:35:17,999
Yeah.

598
00:35:17,999 --> 00:35:19,626
We have this here up on the screen.

599
00:35:19,626 --> 00:35:21,083
I will restart this femtocell.

600
00:35:21,083 --> 00:35:24,125
Don't worry, we are not setting

601
00:35:24,125 --> 00:35:26,999
So if you have an Android phone

602
00:35:26,999 --> 00:35:31,834
As soon as we plug it in here, we

603
00:35:31,834 --> 00:35:35,999
if you could see it,

604
00:35:35,999 --> 00:35:40,542
modified by Samsung here

605
00:35:40,542 --> 00:35:43,459
into the command prompt.

606
00:35:44,959 --> 00:35:46,834
And let's see.

607
00:35:46,999 --> 00:35:48,542
So

608
00:35:48,542 --> 00:35:51,999
DAVIDOFF: Going through our script.

609
00:35:51,999 --> 00:35:53,209
So onand boot.

610
00:35:53,209 --> 00:35:58,125
DAVID HARRISON: So onand boot

611
00:35:58,125 --> 00:36:04,501
because the chip set on there uses

612
00:36:04,501 --> 00:36:07,918
proprietary to Samsung.

613
00:36:09,999 --> 00:36:15,167
Here we see we now dropped

614
00:36:15,167 --> 00:36:20,375
up because we didn't actually run

615
00:36:20,375 --> 00:36:23,250
SHERRI DAVIDOFF: Now we are

616
00:36:23,459 --> 00:36:25,999
DAVID HARRISON: Most of this

617
00:36:26,417 --> 00:36:29,792
There's a couple

618
00:36:29,834 --> 00:36:35,083
There's one S70 app that actually starts

619
00:36:35,083 --> 00:36:38,334
for the cellular traffic.

620
00:36:39,292 --> 00:36:41,751
And so we're choosing

621
00:36:41,751 --> 00:36:43,834
to do before we run that.

622
00:36:44,584 --> 00:36:48,999
Another thing that's a quirk

623
00:36:48,999 --> 00:36:52,876
is accessible until you run some

624
00:36:52,876 --> 00:36:57,709
because of the way ONAND works,

625
00:36:57,709 --> 00:37:01,584
of different blocks and block devices.

626
00:37:01,584 --> 00:37:03,542
SHERRI DAVIDOFF: Extract RFS.SH.

627
00:37:03,584 --> 00:37:09,999
DAVID HARRISON: What we do

628
00:37:09,999 --> 00:37:15,209
and sim linking them in the file.

629
00:37:15,334 --> 00:37:20,834
So for instance, /ubin contains lots

630
00:37:20,834 --> 00:37:23,999
but that's not mounted

631
00:37:23,999 --> 00:37:27,250
of these init scripts, rfs.sh.

632
00:37:27,999 --> 00:37:31,375
So let's see, what are we seeing here?

633
00:37:31,918 --> 00:37:35,209
SHERRI DAVIDOFF: Now we are

634
00:37:35,209 --> 00:37:38,167
and then we'll set up networking.

635
00:37:39,083 --> 00:37:41,459
The reason we set up networking

636
00:37:41,459 --> 00:37:44,542
to download those extra binaries that

637
00:37:44,542 --> 00:37:46,792
and we need to copy over.

638
00:37:46,792 --> 00:37:50,125
DAVID HARRISON: Fortunately there

639
00:37:50,125 --> 00:37:51,125
FTP is there.

640
00:37:51,709 --> 00:37:55,083
We will use that to connect.

641
00:37:55,083 --> 00:37:57,626
That's the address

642
00:37:59,834 --> 00:38:05,876
Going to say CD

643
00:38:05,876 --> 00:38:10,999
The binaries we are downloading are

644
00:38:10,999 --> 00:38:16,375
the kernel modules,

645
00:38:16,375 --> 00:38:25,918
into NFqueue and a binary for Netcat,

646
00:38:27,999 --> 00:38:32,083
We won't keep copying

647
00:38:32,834 --> 00:38:35,083
So we will run that script.

648
00:38:35,083 --> 00:38:36,375
It is going to print

649
00:38:36,375 --> 00:38:37,999
can see them.

650
00:38:38,167 --> 00:38:41,417
SHERRI DAVIDOFF: We are inserting

651
00:38:41,417 --> 00:38:43,792
DAVID HARRISON: Order

652
00:38:43,999 --> 00:38:49,125
SHERRI DAVIDOFF: We will start

653
00:38:51,459 --> 00:38:53,999
DAVID HARRISON: These two

654
00:38:53,999 --> 00:38:57,417
they are something Samsung put

655
00:38:57,417 --> 00:39:00,999
They just automatically configure

656
00:39:00,999 --> 00:39:05,083
and this usually takes a couple

657
00:39:05,083 --> 00:39:06,999
It sets up and tears down.

658
00:39:07,083 --> 00:39:12,083
It grabs like NTP and tears

659
00:39:12,083 --> 00:39:15,999
up its final connection.

660
00:39:17,751 --> 00:39:19,999
So next.

661
00:39:19,999 --> 00:39:23,083
SHERRI DAVIDOFF: So then we kill

662
00:39:23,083 --> 00:39:28,792
the SSH and then we start

663
00:39:28,792 --> 00:39:32,999
So at this point we are waiting

664
00:39:33,083 --> 00:39:36,999
So as soon as I collect the traffic

665
00:39:36,999 --> 00:39:38,999
over to the SIDs.

666
00:39:39,125 --> 00:39:41,999
So press enter to input pockets

667
00:39:44,334 --> 00:39:48,792
DAVID HARRISON: It's really

668
00:39:48,792 --> 00:39:51,292
for that netcat tunnel.

669
00:39:51,501 --> 00:39:55,125
Otherwise, you will have

670
00:39:58,918 --> 00:40:02,834
SHERRI DAVIDOFF: Then you hit

671
00:40:02,834 --> 00:40:04,999
the rule routing.

672
00:40:06,999 --> 00:40:11,459
We wouldn't always want to start

673
00:40:11,459 --> 00:40:12,999
Sometimes we were just working

674
00:40:12,999 --> 00:40:16,959
and it can take a few minutes

675
00:40:17,125 --> 00:40:20,584
Now, if you look at the size

676
00:40:20,584 --> 00:40:24,209
that's increasing and that's what you

677
00:40:24,209 --> 00:40:27,292
When you make a call, it

678
00:40:27,292 --> 00:40:30,375
DAVID HARRISON: It can take

679
00:40:30,375 --> 00:40:35,417
It requires a correct GPS lock

680
00:40:35,417 --> 00:40:37,125
it likes.

681
00:40:37,125 --> 00:40:39,501
So it can establish

682
00:40:39,501 --> 00:40:43,292
will sit and think, sometimes

683
00:40:43,292 --> 00:40:47,042
will actually have the connection

684
00:40:47,042 --> 00:40:50,459
SHERRI DAVIDOFF: So then,

685
00:40:50,459 --> 00:40:55,999
set up, you can use this tail command,

686
00:40:55,999 --> 00:40:58,834
So Snort is reading

687
00:40:59,125 --> 00:41:01,125
And we have uploaded

688
00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:03,918
on there and you can see it loading.

689
00:41:03,918 --> 00:41:06,999
Commencing packet processing

690
00:41:06,999 --> 00:41:08,083
DAVID HARRISON: Yep.

691
00:41:08,083 --> 00:41:09,876
SHERRI DAVIDOFF: Now we

692
00:41:09,876 --> 00:41:12,667
we show you us actually infecting

693
00:41:14,584 --> 00:41:17,999
We were hoping to do this here,

694
00:41:17,999 --> 00:41:19,375
So we will talk you through it.

695
00:41:21,292 --> 00:41:24,459
So you just watched us start up Snort.

696
00:41:24,999 --> 00:41:27,459
And here's what our screen looks like.

697
00:41:27,459 --> 00:41:29,250
DAVID HARRISON: KBM button.

698
00:41:29,250 --> 00:41:33,083
SHERRI DAVIDOFF: Good.

699
00:41:33,083 --> 00:41:34,083
Okay.

700
00:41:34,083 --> 00:41:35,083
So you just watched us start

701
00:41:35,083 --> 00:41:37,083
the full screen looks like.

702
00:41:37,083 --> 00:41:39,834
In the top left,

703
00:41:39,999 --> 00:41:43,209
That second window down there

704
00:41:43,209 --> 00:41:46,999
to the console point on the femtocell.

705
00:41:47,709 --> 00:41:51,834
Here, if I hit play you will see you

706
00:41:51,834 --> 00:41:55,667
of that increase over time,

707
00:41:55,667 --> 00:41:57,209
down there.

708
00:41:57,209 --> 00:42:00,999
Now this is a phone starting

709
00:42:00,999 --> 00:42:03,999
This is recorded using that audio

710
00:42:03,999 --> 00:42:04,999
And this is David.

711
00:42:04,999 --> 00:42:07,083
DAVID HARRISON: Compressed

712
00:42:07,083 --> 00:42:12,417
SHERRI DAVIDOFF: This is David,

713
00:42:12,751 --> 00:42:15,959
We are watching for Snort alerts

714
00:42:15,999 --> 00:42:21,083
As the phone starts up, boom,

715
00:42:21,083 --> 00:42:25,125
welcome to welcome to the network,

716
00:42:25,125 --> 00:42:27,626
We know that there's a new phone

717
00:42:29,083 --> 00:42:32,751
So jumping ahead a little bit,

718
00:42:32,751 --> 00:42:34,292
David, you got a text message.

719
00:42:34,375 --> 00:42:37,083
Someone says, hey, check this out.

720
00:42:37,167 --> 00:42:39,083
It was sneakynet.com.

721
00:42:39,459 --> 00:42:44,918
And we will go poor David

722
00:42:44,918 --> 00:42:46,667
Now usually you will see this be

723
00:42:46,667 --> 00:42:48,834
with the Stels malware.

724
00:42:50,959 --> 00:42:53,999
That actually said we

725
00:42:55,334 --> 00:42:57,834
So this attacker was more creative.

726
00:42:57,834 --> 00:43:01,501
It said, you would like some candy

727
00:43:01,626 --> 00:43:03,375
DAVID HARRISON: I love candy.

728
00:43:03,375 --> 00:43:04,334
SHERRI DAVIDOFF: And as soon

729
00:43:04,334 --> 00:43:06,667
the malware started to download it.

730
00:43:10,250 --> 00:43:14,501
Detected that binary just based

731
00:43:16,459 --> 00:43:18,999
So now the user installs it.

732
00:43:19,834 --> 00:43:22,999
It always boggles my mind that this

733
00:43:22,999 --> 00:43:26,792
users know they have to download

734
00:43:26,999 --> 00:43:28,209
We try to train them.

735
00:43:31,083 --> 00:43:33,999
And here's David installing the update.

736
00:43:33,999 --> 00:43:37,167
Now it warns you that this this malware

737
00:43:37,167 --> 00:43:40,167
permissions to make phone calls.

738
00:43:40,209 --> 00:43:41,999
DAVID HARRISON: Whatever.

739
00:43:44,083 --> 00:43:46,459
Who actually reads all of that stuff?

740
00:43:46,584 --> 00:43:49,501
SHERRI DAVIDOFF: Yeah.

741
00:43:49,626 --> 00:43:51,626
Now the application is installed.

742
00:43:52,667 --> 00:43:54,751
And funny,

743
00:43:54,751 --> 00:43:57,999
your Android version does not support

744
00:43:57,999 --> 00:43:59,542
Set up is canceled.

745
00:43:59,542 --> 00:44:01,125
So the user will say, damn it.

746
00:44:01,709 --> 00:44:02,999
Sorry, darn it!

747
00:44:04,083 --> 00:44:07,626
And I guess Flash Player hasn't been

748
00:44:07,626 --> 00:44:10,501
So the application which appeared

749
00:44:10,501 --> 00:44:15,918
but it is still running as we will see

750
00:44:15,918 --> 00:44:18,375
I believe it takes, was it 60 seconds?

751
00:44:18,375 --> 00:44:18,999
DAVID HARRISON: Yes,

752
00:44:18,999 --> 00:44:20,999
to the first connection of CNC.

753
00:44:22,834 --> 00:44:26,876
There you go,

754
00:44:26,999 --> 00:44:29,209
To the user, I zoomed in here.

755
00:44:29,250 --> 00:44:31,626
It doesn't look

756
00:44:32,626 --> 00:44:37,999
But here you see possible CNC server

757
00:44:37,999 --> 00:44:42,667
in the United States, 31.170.161.216,

758
00:44:42,667 --> 00:44:45,375
from the infected client.

759
00:44:45,375 --> 00:44:47,542
That's

760
00:44:47,542 --> 00:44:51,999
using HTTP post messages

761
00:44:51,999 --> 00:44:57,167
allow us to tell specifically when it's

762
00:44:57,167 --> 00:44:59,209
We will show those here

763
00:45:00,626 --> 00:45:02,999
And I believe we are seeing multiple

764
00:45:02,999 --> 00:45:05,667
because of the way that we are sniffing.

765
00:45:05,667 --> 00:45:07,375
So that's something that we might want

766
00:45:07,375 --> 00:45:10,417
so that we are only seeing one copy.

767
00:45:10,667 --> 00:45:13,584
We are sniffing on all the interfaces

768
00:45:17,999 --> 00:45:19,292
Okay.

769
00:45:19,834 --> 00:45:22,417
So here, again, that phone

770
00:45:22,417 --> 00:45:26,667
And every 15 minutes it sends

771
00:45:26,667 --> 00:45:30,709
First time it happens it sends

772
00:45:30,751 --> 00:45:34,876
That system in the United States,

773
00:45:34,876 --> 00:45:37,918
change the CNC server address.

774
00:45:37,918 --> 00:45:41,999
So next you see it start talking

775
00:45:41,999 --> 00:45:45,918
right here, that's based

776
00:45:46,167 --> 00:45:49,999
That 95 IP address said remove SMS

777
00:45:49,999 --> 00:45:53,375
So whatever SMS traffic was being

778
00:45:53,375 --> 00:45:58,417
it's removing those filters and now

779
00:45:58,417 --> 00:45:59,417
That's nice.

780
00:45:59,417 --> 00:46:00,834
And then you saw a wait 900.

781
00:46:00,834 --> 00:46:02,167
Let me back up here.

782
00:46:03,584 --> 00:46:08,083
We saw a wait 900 command

783
00:46:08,083 --> 00:46:11,751
that's 900 seconds or 15 minutes.

784
00:46:11,959 --> 00:46:15,334
So then we look this run

785
00:46:15,334 --> 00:46:18,083
every 15 minutes

786
00:46:18,083 --> 00:46:20,375
the post command

787
00:46:20,375 --> 00:46:25,542
the server would respond back and say,

788
00:46:25,542 --> 00:46:28,125
So not a whole lot was happening right

789
00:46:28,125 --> 00:46:30,999
over and actually intercepting things.

790
00:46:32,083 --> 00:46:34,584
Any questions on the demo so far?

791
00:46:36,584 --> 00:46:38,083
Anything you wanted to add?

792
00:46:38,083 --> 00:46:39,667
DAVID HARRISON: A question?

793
00:46:39,667 --> 00:46:40,999
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Good.

794
00:46:40,999 --> 00:46:41,999
AUDIENCE MEMBER: If you are not

795
00:46:41,999 --> 00:46:44,626
and you have an Android device that

796
00:46:44,626 --> 00:46:48,417
through Wi Fi, let's say,

797
00:46:56,334 --> 00:46:59,751
DAVID HARRISON: Some

798
00:46:59,751 --> 00:47:05,792
It uses also some SMS messages that

799
00:47:05,792 --> 00:47:07,918
That's true of a couple of different bots.

800
00:47:07,918 --> 00:47:10,501
There's some that use exclusively SMS

801
00:47:10,584 --> 00:47:13,459
This one you would still see

802
00:47:13,459 --> 00:47:16,999
would you still see that over Wi Fi.

803
00:47:17,125 --> 00:47:19,626
SHERRI DAVIDOFF: Yep.

804
00:47:19,626 --> 00:47:21,792
So let's dig into Stels

805
00:47:21,792 --> 00:47:24,667
through this a little more slowly.

806
00:47:26,375 --> 00:47:28,083
All right.

807
00:47:29,999 --> 00:47:32,709
So here you see

808
00:47:32,709 --> 00:47:33,834
Hey, check this out!

809
00:47:33,999 --> 00:47:36,083
Sneakynet.com and here's welcome

810
00:47:36,083 --> 00:47:37,959
like some candy?

811
00:47:38,292 --> 00:47:43,709
And unfortunately David clicked

812
00:47:43,834 --> 00:47:48,209
We saw this first alert in there,

813
00:47:48,417 --> 00:47:49,083
There was an alert

814
00:47:49,083 --> 00:47:51,334
name, flashplayer.Android.update.apk.

815
00:47:56,083 --> 00:47:58,250
If you yourself were

816
00:47:58,250 --> 00:48:02,125
could you see this alert pop

817
00:48:03,209 --> 00:48:04,999
And here's the I think I will have

818
00:48:04,999 --> 00:48:07,667
down there again so I can see this.

819
00:48:07,999 --> 00:48:08,999
Sorry.

820
00:48:08,999 --> 00:48:09,999
Sorry, sound guys.

821
00:48:19,584 --> 00:48:20,999
All right.

822
00:48:20,999 --> 00:48:22,999
So here you see the Android file name.

823
00:48:22,999 --> 00:48:25,459
It's actually part

824
00:48:25,542 --> 00:48:26,999
The HTTP get.

825
00:48:26,999 --> 00:48:29,834
So it's buried

826
00:48:29,834 --> 00:48:32,999
did not dissect this

827
00:48:32,999 --> 00:48:36,083
of the 8081 RDE packets

828
00:48:36,083 --> 00:48:38,999
and that correlates

829
00:48:38,999 --> 00:48:42,083
Flashplayer.Android.update apk.

830
00:48:49,584 --> 00:48:53,584
The second Snort alert was first 42

831
00:48:53,584 --> 00:48:56,083
we saw the first 42 bytes come

832
00:48:56,083 --> 00:48:58,584
up multiple times actually.

833
00:48:58,999 --> 00:49:01,250
Here it is in Wireshark.

834
00:49:01,999 --> 00:49:05,542
Now, because this was coming

835
00:49:05,542 --> 00:49:08,834
an inbound instead of an outbound,

836
00:49:08,834 --> 00:49:13,167
Wireshark actually dissected it

837
00:49:13,584 --> 00:49:17,542
We saw the TCP and it didn't get

838
00:49:17,542 --> 00:49:21,083
of the Android Stels malware,

839
00:49:21,083 --> 00:49:23,709
a Windows executable file.

840
00:49:26,083 --> 00:49:30,167
So then you saw the Flash player

841
00:49:30,167 --> 00:49:32,667
It means it's safe and really

842
00:49:32,667 --> 00:49:37,999
on to the phone, and David used

843
00:49:37,999 --> 00:49:41,083
Here's a clearer version

844
00:49:41,542 --> 00:49:44,167
Do we want to allow this application

845
00:49:44,167 --> 00:49:47,834
read your contact information,

846
00:49:47,834 --> 00:49:50,876
to send out the contact information.

847
00:49:50,999 --> 00:49:53,959
It had full Internet access

848
00:49:53,959 --> 00:49:57,999
on the smartphone and services that

849
00:49:57,999 --> 00:50:00,999
So it can call premium numbers

850
00:50:00,999 --> 00:50:05,751
to premium numbers and it can read

851
00:50:05,792 --> 00:50:08,209
Do you want to install this application?

852
00:50:08,209 --> 00:50:09,209
Why, yes, we do.

853
00:50:09,292 --> 00:50:11,334
Application installed.

854
00:50:12,209 --> 00:50:14,709
Here's what it looked

855
00:50:14,709 --> 00:50:16,334
on the desktop.

856
00:50:16,334 --> 00:50:18,999
Then we get this message saying your

857
00:50:18,999 --> 00:50:22,334
update, setup is canceled and then,

858
00:50:22,334 --> 00:50:25,125
it was still running in the background.

859
00:50:28,584 --> 00:50:30,459
Your mic is not on, David.

860
00:50:30,459 --> 00:50:33,999
DAVID HARRISON: Honestly,

861
00:50:33,999 --> 00:50:38,999
the malware authorities, oh,

862
00:50:38,999 --> 00:50:40,834
We don't have to make it look pretty.

863
00:50:40,834 --> 00:50:43,417
They just put a white screen with text

864
00:50:43,417 --> 00:50:46,167
SHERRI DAVIDOFF: Yeah.

865
00:50:46,167 --> 00:50:50,125
So, again, the user cannot tell that

866
00:50:50,125 --> 00:50:52,375
This is invisible to the end user.

867
00:50:53,042 --> 00:50:57,501
And while this is going on, we saw

868
00:50:57,501 --> 00:51:02,292
and we were alerting on that IP address,

869
00:51:02,292 --> 00:51:04,501
inside the packet.

870
00:51:04,751 --> 00:51:09,501
Here you can see here you can see

871
00:51:09,501 --> 00:51:12,083
So before it starts talking

872
00:51:12,083 --> 00:51:15,209
it has to do a DNS request

873
00:51:15,209 --> 00:51:16,999
a DNS request.

874
00:51:16,999 --> 00:51:22,083
And in the request it was broken

875
00:51:22,417 --> 00:51:26,709
It's interesting that Wireshark actually

876
00:51:26,709 --> 00:51:29,292
We see PPP and IP and then UDP

877
00:51:29,292 --> 00:51:32,292
the highest layer protocol, DNS.

878
00:51:32,999 --> 00:51:35,876
So a challenge to the audience, I

879
00:51:35,876 --> 00:51:38,626
if you fix those protocol dissectors.

880
00:51:39,459 --> 00:51:45,209
It's totally worth it and we saw

881
00:51:46,667 --> 00:51:49,667
Here's fragmentation,

882
00:51:49,667 --> 00:51:52,959
something, the rest

883
00:51:54,999 --> 00:51:56,125
Okay.

884
00:51:56,125 --> 00:51:58,125
So here is an HTTP post.

885
00:51:58,417 --> 00:52:01,999
This HTTP post message

886
00:52:01,999 --> 00:52:04,709
and control traffic.

887
00:52:04,709 --> 00:52:05,999
This is what

888
00:52:05,999 --> 00:52:08,250
like when it's talking

889
00:52:08,250 --> 00:52:10,292
in the Netherlands.

890
00:52:10,584 --> 00:52:13,709
So you can see here PPP Wireshark

891
00:52:13,709 --> 00:52:16,459
but you can see post/data/php.

892
00:52:17,501 --> 00:52:19,999
This was broken

893
00:52:19,999 --> 00:52:24,167
and I had to reassemble them manually,

894
00:52:25,083 --> 00:52:27,459
Here's the first half of it.

895
00:52:27,459 --> 00:52:28,459
It's pretty long.

896
00:52:28,584 --> 00:52:31,792
It has that unique multipart boundary

897
00:52:31,792 --> 00:52:35,959
aabo3x and that's pretty easy

898
00:52:35,959 --> 00:52:37,083
You can see that to Snort.

899
00:52:39,417 --> 00:52:42,083
And you can tell

900
00:52:42,083 --> 00:52:45,834
to the attacker, and

901
00:52:45,999 --> 00:52:49,792
Information about the phone,

902
00:52:52,375 --> 00:52:55,999
Also the name bot ID and some other

903
00:52:55,999 --> 00:52:57,999
the manufacturer.

904
00:52:57,999 --> 00:52:59,959
So it sends a bunch

905
00:52:59,959 --> 00:53:02,209
the bot sends a bunch

906
00:53:02,209 --> 00:53:06,834
to the attacker every 15 minutes

907
00:53:06,834 --> 00:53:10,292
And we can see that happening here,

908
00:53:10,292 --> 00:53:14,999
I alerted on the string bot ID and

909
00:53:14,999 --> 00:53:17,334
in an HTTP post.

910
00:53:19,751 --> 00:53:22,250
Here's the server's response.

911
00:53:22,250 --> 00:53:24,083
So the server is going

912
00:53:24,083 --> 00:53:27,375
and start sending commands

913
00:53:27,375 --> 00:53:29,167
It's just it's a very simple thing.

914
00:53:29,167 --> 00:53:32,250
We actually there's no authentication

915
00:53:32,250 --> 00:53:34,083
and the server.

916
00:53:34,083 --> 00:53:37,167
We have seen malware more complex

917
00:53:37,167 --> 00:53:40,083
when I think it was

918
00:53:40,083 --> 00:53:42,459
we had authentication.

919
00:53:42,834 --> 00:53:46,792
So here, IP, TCP, HTTP,

920
00:53:46,792 --> 00:53:49,334
the HTTP this time.

921
00:53:49,334 --> 00:53:51,667
This is an incoming message

922
00:53:51,667 --> 00:53:53,876
in the Netherlands.

923
00:53:54,125 --> 00:53:57,667
And here's if you reassemble it,

924
00:53:57,667 --> 00:54:01,417
Remove all SMS filters true, okay.

925
00:54:01,417 --> 00:54:02,417
Wait 60.

926
00:54:02,417 --> 00:54:05,709
So it's telling it only wait 60 seconds

927
00:54:05,918 --> 00:54:08,999
And then it changed the server address.

928
00:54:08,999 --> 00:54:10,584
So that's kind of cool.

929
00:54:10,584 --> 00:54:12,999
Scott will talk to you

930
00:54:12,999 --> 00:54:15,083
It can send lots of other commands

931
00:54:15,083 --> 00:54:18,083
Pretty much anything in this let's see,

932
00:54:18,083 --> 00:54:19,999
Pretty much anything

933
00:54:19,999 --> 00:54:23,626
the server can tell to send

934
00:54:23,626 --> 00:54:28,626
It can tell it to delete an SMS,

935
00:54:28,626 --> 00:54:35,792
out to the attacker, or update itself,

936
00:54:35,792 --> 00:54:38,417
It can make phone calls

937
00:54:38,709 --> 00:54:40,999
Where were we?

938
00:54:40,999 --> 00:54:41,999
Okay.

939
00:54:41,999 --> 00:54:43,250
So remove all SMS filters.

940
00:54:43,250 --> 00:54:44,417
We put some of those commands

941
00:54:44,417 --> 00:54:47,626
will alert individually an each

942
00:54:47,626 --> 00:54:49,417
You will have a log

943
00:54:49,417 --> 00:54:51,584
if you set it up this way.

944
00:54:53,584 --> 00:54:56,834
And then again,

945
00:54:56,834 --> 00:54:58,959
we then saw

946
00:54:58,959 --> 00:55:02,083
for the new server name

947
00:55:02,083 --> 00:55:04,167
to go along with it.

948
00:55:05,876 --> 00:55:08,834
So the bot sent a post

949
00:55:08,834 --> 00:55:13,167
over the Netherlands and it received

950
00:55:13,167 --> 00:55:17,459
This time, that second server said,

951
00:55:17,459 --> 00:55:20,999
So instead of telling it wait 60 seconds,

952
00:55:20,999 --> 00:55:23,751
every 15 minutes this would still be

953
00:55:23,751 --> 00:55:27,292
if you were watching your traffic

954
00:55:27,626 --> 00:55:30,584
Every 15 minutes is still pretty noisy

955
00:55:30,584 --> 00:55:33,999
But the attacker could tell it wait

956
00:55:33,999 --> 00:55:35,792
for a month.

957
00:55:35,792 --> 00:55:37,834
And that would be a lot harder

958
00:55:38,999 --> 00:55:40,999
So here's a screen shot.

959
00:55:41,626 --> 00:55:46,667
Our cellular intrusion detection system,

960
00:55:46,792 --> 00:55:48,999
We alerted on the initial infection.

961
00:55:48,999 --> 00:55:50,334
We alerted

962
00:55:50,334 --> 00:55:52,999
the bot made to the attacker.

963
00:55:53,167 --> 00:55:56,083
And you can use this same method

964
00:55:56,083 --> 00:56:00,999
in your environment, whether you are

965
00:56:02,999 --> 00:56:04,999
So now Randi Price is going

966
00:56:04,999 --> 00:56:07,834
about the device forensic analysis.

967
00:56:19,209 --> 00:56:20,999
(Inaudible question).

968
00:56:32,459 --> 00:56:37,751
Were you able to see SMS going

969
00:56:37,751 --> 00:56:40,501
Were you able to inspect it

970
00:56:40,501 --> 00:56:40,501
Did you set maybe

971
00:56:40,501 --> 00:56:41,834
or    DAVID HARRISON: Ah.

972
00:56:41,834 --> 00:56:41,834
SHERRI DAVIDOFF: So

973
00:56:41,834 --> 00:56:44,083
to see SMS messages and set

974
00:56:44,083 --> 00:56:46,792
We do have SMS I'm sorry,

975
00:56:46,876 --> 00:56:48,876
We do have SMS traffic.

976
00:56:48,876 --> 00:56:50,751
We haven't really had too much time

977
00:56:50,751 --> 00:56:52,334
the next step that we are going

978
00:56:52,334 --> 00:56:54,501
around with when we get home.

979
00:56:54,709 --> 00:56:57,999
I'm hoping Tom Ritter

980
00:56:57,999 --> 00:57:00,999
DAVID HARRISON: The thing

981
00:57:00,999 --> 00:57:06,792
but it's reverse 7 or something like that,

982
00:57:06,792 --> 00:57:11,999
As far as the C & C, we will get to that

983
00:57:11,999 --> 00:57:15,250
RANDI PRICE: After capturing traffic

984
00:57:15,250 --> 00:57:17,626
device forensic analysis.

985
00:57:17,999 --> 00:57:21,999
The forensic analysis corroborated

986
00:57:22,209 --> 00:57:25,999
We took a physical extraction

987
00:57:25,999 --> 00:57:28,834
with the UFED

988
00:57:28,834 --> 00:57:30,999
MEMBER: Can't hear.

989
00:57:30,999 --> 00:57:32,083
RANDI PRICE: Okay.

990
00:57:32,083 --> 00:57:33,083
Sorry.

991
00:57:33,083 --> 00:57:37,334
Please note is that better?

992
00:57:37,334 --> 00:57:38,334
Okay.

993
00:57:39,999 --> 00:57:45,083
Please note that the infecting and

994
00:57:45,083 --> 00:57:50,709
with an RF shielded test enclosure,

995
00:57:52,959 --> 00:57:54,167
Okay?

996
00:57:56,417 --> 00:58:01,375
The cellebrite physical analyzer was

997
00:58:01,375 --> 00:58:07,209
The malware scanner identified four

998
00:58:08,375 --> 00:58:11,834
The cellebrite looked

999
00:58:11,834 --> 00:58:14,999
as Android Trojan fakeapp.k.

1000
00:58:17,167 --> 00:58:20,417
And we should the SHA1,

1001
00:58:20,417 --> 00:58:22,999
the SHA1 matched

1002
00:58:22,999 --> 00:58:26,999
for the Android Stels malware recorded

1003
00:58:26,999 --> 00:58:30,999
in the Trojan malware analysis report.

1004
00:58:34,125 --> 00:58:37,999
We found a file called Stels settings

1005
00:58:37,999 --> 00:58:41,709
to contain malware configuration

1006
00:58:41,751 --> 00:58:43,959
As you can see

1007
00:58:43,959 --> 00:58:45,999
is assigned a bot ID.

1008
00:58:46,083 --> 00:58:49,959
This allows the bot herder

1009
00:58:49,999 --> 00:58:54,167
The server listed is the command

1010
00:58:54,167 --> 00:58:57,459
the bot where to phone home to.

1011
00:58:58,125 --> 00:59:00,999
The period value of 300 seconds

1012
00:59:00,999 --> 00:59:04,083
is the initial phone home interval.

1013
00:59:04,083 --> 00:59:06,834
This tells the bot

1014
00:59:06,834 --> 00:59:17,709
SCOTT FRETHEIM: Thank you.

1015
00:59:17,709 --> 00:59:18,709
All right.

1016
00:59:18,709 --> 00:59:19,876
Good morning, DEF CON!

1017
00:59:19,876 --> 00:59:21,626
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Good

1018
00:59:21,626 --> 00:59:21,999
SCOTT FRETHEIM: I'm super stoked

1019
00:59:21,999 --> 00:59:23,417
at 10 a.m.

1020
00:59:23,417 --> 00:59:24,417
on a Saturday.

1021
00:59:24,417 --> 00:59:27,626
I I'm going to happen down here

1022
00:59:29,083 --> 00:59:32,459
AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Inaudible).

1023
00:59:32,459 --> 00:59:34,125
SCOTT FRETHEIM: Stronger ones.

1024
00:59:34,125 --> 00:59:35,125
All right.

1025
00:59:35,209 --> 00:59:38,876
So because of the research that Randi

1026
00:59:38,876 --> 00:59:42,999
to determine the way that Stels

1027
00:59:44,709 --> 00:59:47,501
We knew the address

1028
00:59:47,501 --> 00:59:50,083
We also knew kind

1029
00:59:50,626 --> 00:59:53,083
So let's be a man in the middle.

1030
00:59:53,459 --> 00:59:55,083
When you want to do man

1031
00:59:55,083 --> 00:59:56,876
I had to set

1032
00:59:56,876 --> 00:59:58,999
the traffic back through there.

1033
00:59:59,709 --> 01:00:02,834
So enter Burp suite professional.

1034
01:00:04,125 --> 01:00:07,083
To set this up, we had to tunnel

1035
01:00:07,083 --> 01:00:11,417
through Burp suite and we were looking

1036
01:00:12,999 --> 01:00:16,626
Just to be sure, that I was getting

1037
01:00:16,626 --> 01:00:18,667
the Android device.

1038
01:00:19,209 --> 01:00:22,292
What I do mobile Android testing.

1039
01:00:22,292 --> 01:00:27,999
I take a rooted device in order to get

1040
01:00:28,125 --> 01:00:30,999
Perhaps Stels is using two forms

1041
01:00:30,999 --> 01:00:33,584
seeing that encrypted portion of that.

1042
01:00:33,959 --> 01:00:36,834
Doing that on an Android phone

1043
01:00:36,834 --> 01:00:37,999
You have

1044
01:00:37,999 --> 01:00:40,209
packet to the device itself.

1045
01:00:40,584 --> 01:00:43,125
But to do that, you have

1046
01:00:43,626 --> 01:00:46,834
You have to use an outdated version

1047
01:00:46,834 --> 01:00:48,999
I think I was using 0.98.

1048
01:00:49,375 --> 01:00:51,292
I think that shifted

1049
01:00:51,292 --> 01:00:54,751
is the virtual machine I set

1050
01:00:54,999 --> 01:00:57,751
You have to create

1051
01:00:57,751 --> 01:01:01,250
of the subject line of the certificate,

1052
01:01:01,250 --> 01:01:03,999
to that and install that

1053
01:01:03,999 --> 01:01:08,375
down into the system directory

1054
01:01:08,999 --> 01:01:11,167
To do, that you have to have root

1055
01:01:11,667 --> 01:01:13,999
Once I had root, I launched it.

1056
01:01:16,417 --> 01:01:18,459
And now we can see

1057
01:01:18,459 --> 01:01:21,751
through that phone, if it's

1058
01:01:21,751 --> 01:01:24,667
just a mobile banking app, I can see

1059
01:01:24,667 --> 01:01:28,083
through and actually intercept that

1060
01:01:28,626 --> 01:01:31,375
In this case, I didn't have to end

1061
01:01:31,584 --> 01:01:34,999
All the traffic was going over port 80,

1062
01:01:34,999 --> 01:01:37,501
and let's take a look here.

1063
01:01:37,501 --> 01:01:39,083
We turn on intercept, of course.

1064
01:01:39,501 --> 01:01:44,999
So what I saw was, I will show you,

1065
01:01:45,250 --> 01:01:48,167
So it's not listening on that,

1066
01:01:48,501 --> 01:01:49,999
It's saying wait 60.

1067
01:01:49,999 --> 01:01:52,334
It is telling it to wait 60 seconds

1068
01:01:52,334 --> 01:01:54,999
set the command and control filter.

1069
01:01:55,999 --> 01:01:58,209
I wonder if it's going to be this easy.

1070
01:01:58,209 --> 01:02:00,417
All I had to do was replace

1071
01:02:00,417 --> 01:02:02,709
with a server that my own

1072
01:02:02,709 --> 01:02:05,083
will be calling back to me.

1073
01:02:05,501 --> 01:02:06,999
I did that.

1074
01:02:06,999 --> 01:02:08,834
I told it to wait 60.

1075
01:02:08,834 --> 01:02:14,125
I set the remove all SMS filters true

1076
01:02:14,167 --> 01:02:16,667
Sure enough it worked

1077
01:02:16,667 --> 01:02:19,375
instead of the all C & C server.

1078
01:02:19,501 --> 01:02:23,751
The server I set

1079
01:02:23,751 --> 01:02:25,083
It would get a 404 error.

1080
01:02:25,125 --> 01:02:27,834
When the bot actually received that 404

1081
01:02:27,834 --> 01:02:29,584
out and then you have

1082
01:02:29,584 --> 01:02:32,999
until you can actually start

1083
01:02:33,083 --> 01:02:34,999
I thought this is kind of troublesome.

1084
01:02:34,999 --> 01:02:35,999
It.

1085
01:02:35,999 --> 01:02:37,999
Take me way more time

1086
01:02:37,999 --> 01:02:39,667
I continued to keep intercepting

1087
01:02:39,667 --> 01:02:43,999
to wait 60 or wait 5 or 30, depending

1088
01:02:44,083 --> 01:02:47,125
I found out when I tried to wait 2

1089
01:02:47,125 --> 01:02:49,375
fast, it would eventually time

1090
01:02:49,375 --> 01:02:51,334
between 5 and 15 minutes

1091
01:02:51,334 --> 01:02:54,417
out again and that was even less

1092
01:02:56,417 --> 01:02:59,334
You can also adjust it for, you know,

1093
01:02:59,334 --> 01:03:03,375
if you want to take a break and go

1094
01:03:03,375 --> 01:03:04,918
I found that pretty helpful.

1095
01:03:05,999 --> 01:03:07,999
So controlling Stels.

1096
01:03:07,999 --> 01:03:09,626
I wanted to see

1097
01:03:09,626 --> 01:03:13,083
to export that contact list

1098
01:03:13,334 --> 01:03:14,876
And sure enough, you can.

1099
01:03:15,083 --> 01:03:18,999
I just had to set send contact list true,

1100
01:03:19,459 --> 01:03:21,083
And 60 seconds later,

1101
01:03:21,083 --> 01:03:23,792
out that contact information

1102
01:03:23,792 --> 01:03:26,125
of the page here, I actually got

1103
01:03:26,125 --> 01:03:29,083
off of that device and you can read that.

1104
01:03:29,083 --> 01:03:31,834
It sent it right back to the attacker

1105
01:03:31,834 --> 01:03:34,876
command and control server,

1106
01:03:34,876 --> 01:03:37,250
in my device and

1107
01:03:37,250 --> 01:03:39,751
servers to infect more phones.

1108
01:03:40,083 --> 01:03:43,626
I find this really helpful if you are

1109
01:03:43,626 --> 01:03:43,792
I don't know how many of you have

1110
01:03:43,792 --> 01:03:45,667
to manage IT where you are from.

1111
01:03:46,334 --> 01:03:50,626
If you have a device on your network,

1112
01:03:50,626 --> 01:03:54,417
because we have

1113
01:03:54,417 --> 01:03:57,584
to find that device,

1114
01:03:57,584 --> 01:04:02,626
and you can't gain access to it

1115
01:04:02,709 --> 01:04:04,501
Using this method.

1116
01:04:04,501 --> 01:04:06,375
We never even touched the device

1117
01:04:06,375 --> 01:04:08,999
off the head of the snake, so to speak.

1118
01:04:09,167 --> 01:04:10,999
If the attacker

1119
01:04:10,999 --> 01:04:12,751
with that device, the attacker

1120
01:04:12,751 --> 01:04:15,667
to steal that data this buys us a lot

1121
01:04:15,667 --> 01:04:16,999
down, get

1122
01:04:16,999 --> 01:04:19,626
and get that virus cleaned off of there.

1123
01:04:21,167 --> 01:04:23,709
SHERRI DAVIDOFF: Nice.

1124
01:04:25,250 --> 01:04:27,334
Thank you, Scott!

1125
01:04:28,999 --> 01:04:32,417
So that pretty much concludes our

1126
01:04:32,417 --> 01:04:35,083
As you saw, we were able to infect

1127
01:04:35,083 --> 01:04:37,083
as a demonstration.

1128
01:04:37,083 --> 01:04:40,709
We detected the infection

1129
01:04:40,709 --> 01:04:46,083
and no agent was actually needed

1130
01:04:46,083 --> 01:04:49,918
We could have shut this down remotely,

1131
01:04:49,918 --> 01:04:54,999
This was all for $285 and a little bit

1132
01:04:55,999 --> 01:04:58,375
And, of course, if you wanted

1133
01:04:58,375 --> 01:05:00,250
you certainly could.

1134
01:05:00,250 --> 01:05:01,959
Again, here's the parts list.

1135
01:05:01,959 --> 01:05:04,083
All you need is a femtocell,

1136
01:05:04,083 --> 01:05:07,999
whether it's a laptop or

1137
01:05:07,999 --> 01:05:11,375
is, a hub or

1138
01:05:12,375 --> 01:05:14,542
Thank you all so much.

1139
01:05:14,542 --> 01:05:16,375
We will take questions,

1140
01:05:16,375 --> 01:05:18,667
a little bit closer up,

1141
01:05:18,667 --> 01:05:20,626
to be in afterwards?

1142
01:05:20,626 --> 01:05:22,999
We will tear

1143
01:05:22,999 --> 01:05:24,417
So feel free to come visit us.

1144
01:05:24,417 --> 01:05:25,751
LMGsecurity.com/blog.

1145
01:05:25,751 --> 01:05:26,751
(Applause).

1146
01:05:26,751 --> 01:05:27,751
Questions?

1147
01:05:27,751 --> 01:05:30,083
DAVID HARRISON: Anyone have any

1148
01:05:30,083 --> 01:05:33,459
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Can you put

1149
01:05:33,459 --> 01:05:33,459
SHERRI DAVIDOFF: It's

1150
01:05:33,459 --> 01:05:34,459
for the paper.

1151
01:05:34,459 --> 01:05:35,709
It's up there right now.

1152
01:05:35,709 --> 01:05:35,709
AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Inaudible

1153
01:05:35,709 --> 01:05:35,709
the malware defect it it's actual

1154
01:05:35,709 --> 01:05:35,709
DAVIDOFF: Can you make phones

1155
01:05:35,709 --> 01:05:36,709
instead of a tower?

1156
01:05:36,709 --> 01:05:37,876
DAVID HARRISON: No.

1157
01:05:37,876 --> 01:05:38,876
No.

1158
01:05:38,876 --> 01:05:38,876
No if I'm right, can you can could

1159
01:05:38,876 --> 01:05:39,876
on a CIDS system?

1160
01:05:39,876 --> 01:05:40,999
At this point, probably.

1161
01:05:40,999 --> 01:05:40,999
You could certainly design one

1162
01:05:40,999 --> 01:05:44,709
or someone or maybe even just modify

1163
01:05:44,709 --> 01:05:44,709
Right now, you can see if you have

1164
01:05:44,709 --> 01:05:44,709
you will see it pops

1165
01:05:44,709 --> 01:05:45,999
connected to a femtocell.

1166
01:05:45,999 --> 01:05:47,083
It's in our white paper.

1167
01:05:47,083 --> 01:05:50,709
And if you download our paper, you

1168
01:05:50,709 --> 01:05:50,709
(Inaudible question)    DAVID

1169
01:05:50,709 --> 01:05:52,667
SHERRI DAVIDOFF: Which phone

1170
01:05:52,667 --> 01:05:52,667
AUDIENCE MEMBER: The 50 phones

1171
01:05:52,667 --> 01:05:55,501
DAVIDOFF: For Android Stels, it was

1172
01:05:55,501 --> 01:05:55,501
When it communicates

1173
01:05:55,501 --> 01:05:56,751
here's my phone number.

1174
01:05:56,751 --> 01:05:59,751
DAVID HARRISON: We can see

1175
01:05:59,751 --> 01:06:02,375
And I want to say that we can see

1176
01:06:02,375 --> 01:06:02,375
SHERRI DAVIDOFF: We can see

1177
01:06:02,375 --> 01:06:05,999
number out to Verizon to register

1178
01:06:05,999 --> 01:06:05,999
I'm not sure how programmatically, like,

1179
01:06:05,999 --> 01:06:06,999
is to find that out.

1180
01:06:06,999 --> 01:06:08,292
But theoretically, sure.

1181
01:06:08,292 --> 01:06:10,999
You could also figure out a way

1182
01:06:10,999 --> 01:06:11,999
Yep?

1183
01:06:11,999 --> 01:06:14,250
AUDIENCE MEMBER: You said you

1184
01:06:14,250 --> 01:06:14,250
Can it spoof saying it's

1185
01:06:14,250 --> 01:06:14,250
in airplane mode

1186
01:06:14,250 --> 01:06:14,250
DAVIDOFF: That's a great question,

1187
01:06:14,250 --> 01:06:14,250
in airplane mode this particular

1188
01:06:14,250 --> 01:06:16,167
with root access to your device could.

1189
01:06:16,167 --> 01:06:16,167
DAVID HARRISON: It would be

1190
01:06:16,167 --> 01:06:16,167
for the malware authors

1191
01:06:16,167 --> 01:06:17,876
a theoretical barrier to that.

1192
01:06:17,876 --> 01:06:17,876
AUDIENCE MEMBER: How did you

1193
01:06:17,876 --> 01:06:20,250
through    SHERRI DAVIDOFF: That

1194
01:06:20,250 --> 01:06:21,584
DAVID HARRISON: Yeah.

1195
01:06:21,584 --> 01:06:24,292
SHERRI DAVIDOFF: I think

1196
01:06:24,292 --> 01:06:24,292
AUDIENCE MEMBER: So what was

1197
01:06:24,292 --> 01:06:25,918
since the first one got fixed?

1198
01:06:25,918 --> 01:06:28,918
And how much does the sheilding

1199
01:06:28,918 --> 01:06:28,918
SHERRI DAVIDOFF: The shield

1200
01:06:28,918 --> 01:06:32,125
depending whether or not you want

1201
01:06:32,125 --> 01:06:33,459
Yeah, they are real nice.

1202
01:06:33,459 --> 01:06:35,125
Tell them that you saw it over here.

1203
01:06:35,125 --> 01:06:38,584
AUDIENCE MEMBER: And what

1204
01:06:38,584 --> 01:06:41,584
DAVID HARRISON: That

1205
01:06:41,584 --> 01:06:43,167
Other people published that one.

1206
01:06:43,167 --> 01:06:44,709
You should be able to find it.

1207
01:06:44,709 --> 01:06:44,709
(Inaudible question)    AUDIENCE

1208
01:06:44,709 --> 01:06:45,709
in IP tables.

1209
01:06:45,709 --> 01:06:45,709
Do you have any plans to, I don't know,

1210
01:06:45,709 --> 01:06:45,709
instead of running through Netcat

1211
01:06:45,709 --> 01:06:46,709
HARRISON: Right.

1212
01:06:46,709 --> 01:06:47,999
SHERRI DAVIDOFF: Yes.

1213
01:06:47,999 --> 01:06:50,876
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I hear Snort

1214
01:06:50,876 --> 01:06:52,999
DAVID HARRISON: That would be

1215
01:06:52,999 --> 01:06:52,999
We are running

1216
01:06:52,999 --> 01:06:52,999
is the exact    AUDIENCE MEMBER: So

1217
01:06:52,999 --> 01:06:54,751
we can probably help you with that.

1218
01:06:54,751 --> 01:06:56,125
DAVID HARRISON: I figured.

1219
01:06:56,125 --> 01:06:57,751
SHERRI DAVIDOFF: Awesome!

1220
01:06:57,751 --> 01:06:57,751
DAVID HARRISON: We would

1221
01:06:57,751 --> 01:06:59,999
to run it more smoothly

1222
01:06:59,999 --> 01:06:59,999
AUDIENCE MEMBER: About

1223
01:06:59,999 --> 01:06:59,999
through your devices, the devices

1224
01:06:59,999 --> 01:07:01,209
in the network traffic?

1225
01:07:01,209 --> 01:07:04,626
SHERRI DAVIDOFF: There

1226
01:07:04,626 --> 01:07:04,626
I believe that Tom Ritter got his traffic

1227
01:07:04,626 --> 01:07:04,626
like to sit down and compare

1228
01:07:04,626 --> 01:07:05,626
to do it.

1229
01:07:05,626 --> 01:07:07,167
We have just done it this one way.

1230
01:07:07,167 --> 01:07:07,167
DAVID HARRISON: Like we said,

1231
01:07:07,167 --> 01:07:07,167
you are seeing it after it passes

1232
01:07:07,167 --> 01:07:07,167
all encrypted, and if you pull it

1233
01:07:07,167 --> 01:07:07,167
before it gets passed

1234
01:07:07,167 --> 01:07:07,167
all unencrypted and it doesn't have

1235
01:07:07,167 --> 01:07:09,667
The magic was bypassing

1236
01:07:09,667 --> 01:07:13,083
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I'm saying it

1237
01:07:13,083 --> 01:07:13,083
If you have' device saying so basically

1238
01:07:13,083 --> 01:07:14,959
to you don't need to (Inaudible).

1239
01:07:14,959 --> 01:07:14,959
captured here, versus the traffic

1240
01:07:14,959 --> 01:07:14,959
up to say    AUDIENCE MEMBER:

1241
01:07:14,959 --> 01:07:14,959
DAVID HARRISON: So

1242
01:07:14,959 --> 01:07:14,959
are we seeing a difference

1243
01:07:17,417 --> 01:07:20,083
DAVID HARRISON: A wireless

1244
01:07:20,083 --> 01:07:21,876
AUDIENCE MEMBER: No, a device.

1245
01:07:21,876 --> 01:07:21,876
DAVID HARRISON: Oh, oh, so

1246
01:07:21,876 --> 01:07:22,999
on the Android device.

1247
01:07:22,999 --> 01:07:24,459
SHERRI DAVIDOFF: Oh, yeah.

1248
01:07:24,459 --> 01:07:26,083
DAVID HARRISON: We tried that.

1249
01:07:26,083 --> 01:07:28,459
We just wanted access

1250
01:07:28,459 --> 01:07:30,083
So we were like, oh, that's easy.

1251
01:07:30,083 --> 01:07:31,083
Tried that.

1252
01:07:31,083 --> 01:07:31,083
Didn't work

1253
01:07:31,083 --> 01:07:31,083
of the network traffic back out,

1254
01:07:31,083 --> 01:07:34,584
all of that    SHERRI DAVIDOFF: We

1255
01:07:34,584 --> 01:07:34,584
DAVID HARRISON: It goes straight

1256
01:07:34,584 --> 01:07:37,209
captured by software you put

1257
01:07:37,209 --> 01:07:37,209
So    SHERRI DAVIDOFF: Also,

1258
01:07:37,209 --> 01:07:38,709
up your IDS that way anyway.

1259
01:07:38,709 --> 01:07:38,709
If you have an infected system,

1260
01:07:38,709 --> 01:07:39,709
traffic you see.

1261
01:07:39,709 --> 01:07:39,709
So really, you want it

1262
01:07:39,709 --> 01:07:40,792
that's not infected.

1263
01:07:40,792 --> 01:07:40,792
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Is the list

1264
01:07:40,792 --> 01:07:43,999
to the femtocell, is that controlled

1265
01:07:43,999 --> 01:07:43,999
DAVID HARRISON: I want

1266
01:07:43,999 --> 01:07:43,999
it's managed through, like,

1267
01:07:43,999 --> 01:07:43,999
so you register the femtocell, go

1268
01:07:43,999 --> 01:07:47,667
I want these devices that I own that are

1269
01:07:47,667 --> 01:07:50,501
So and then it passes that

1270
01:07:50,501 --> 01:07:50,501
It would be really great

1271
01:07:50,501 --> 01:07:50,501
core network so that they so that

1272
01:07:50,501 --> 01:07:52,250
about who connected to femtocells.

1273
01:07:52,250 --> 01:07:55,584
Because these things have been

1274
01:07:55,584 --> 01:07:57,834
The original malware came

1275
01:07:57,834 --> 01:07:57,834
It would be great

1276
01:07:57,834 --> 01:07:57,834
about what when you were

1277
01:07:57,834 --> 01:07:57,834
and so

1278
01:07:57,834 --> 01:08:00,375
whether or not they hooked

1279
01:08:00,375 --> 01:08:03,167
So    SHERRI DAVIDOFF: Can we get

1280
01:08:03,167 --> 01:08:05,751
DAVID HARRISON: This sounds

1281
01:08:05,751 --> 01:08:06,751
Okay.

1282
01:08:06,751 --> 01:08:07,751
Other questions?

1283
01:08:07,751 --> 01:08:08,751
Yeah?

1284
01:08:08,751 --> 01:08:11,292
AUDIENCE MEMBER: What

1285
01:08:11,292 --> 01:08:13,501
SHERRI DAVIDOFF: We have not

1286
01:08:13,501 --> 01:08:13,501
Honestly, we are not

1287
01:08:13,501 --> 01:08:14,501
a consulting firm.

1288
01:08:14,501 --> 01:08:14,501
And yeah, we wanted to put this

1289
01:08:14,501 --> 01:08:14,501
to make a ton

1290
01:08:14,501 --> 01:08:15,667
is Verizon here today?

1291
01:08:15,667 --> 01:08:17,709
Is anyone here from Verizon

1292
01:08:17,709 --> 01:08:18,709
Just curious.

1293
01:08:18,709 --> 01:08:19,709
Yes?

1294
01:08:19,709 --> 01:08:22,792
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I wonder what

1295
01:08:22,792 --> 01:08:24,626
SHERRI DAVIDOFF: Great question.

1296
01:08:24,626 --> 01:08:24,626
I think the first thing that comes

1297
01:08:24,626 --> 01:08:24,626
will be giving people the ability

1298
01:08:24,626 --> 01:08:24,626
right or text messages,

1299
01:08:24,626 --> 01:08:24,626
people are already using the Internet,

1300
01:08:24,626 --> 01:08:25,626
and Google voice.

1301
01:08:25,626 --> 01:08:25,626
So your phone calls are already going

1302
01:08:25,626 --> 01:08:25,626
to be no issue

1303
01:08:25,626 --> 01:08:26,626
in that traffic.

1304
01:08:26,626 --> 01:08:27,999
I think it's pretty similar.

1305
01:08:27,999 --> 01:08:29,999
We have been    DAVID HARRISON:

1306
01:08:29,999 --> 01:08:30,999
This one is now on.

1307
01:08:30,999 --> 01:08:32,209
SHERRI DAVIDOFF: Okay.

1308
01:08:32,209 --> 01:08:35,584
We have been represented

1309
01:08:35,584 --> 01:08:35,584
If you are careful to restrict access

1310
01:08:35,584 --> 01:08:35,584
capturing packets and call content

1311
01:08:35,584 --> 01:08:38,999
then they didn't see any issue with it,

1312
01:08:38,999 --> 01:08:38,999
DAVID HARRISON: Also keep

1313
01:08:38,999 --> 01:08:38,999
I would be way more concerned

1314
01:08:38,999 --> 01:08:38,999
to get malware on my device

1315
01:08:38,999 --> 01:08:42,083
to my phone calls that way than there's

1316
01:08:42,083 --> 01:08:46,125
That's a concern but between the two,

1317
01:08:46,125 --> 01:08:46,125
SHERRI DAVIDOFF: And in terms

1318
01:08:46,125 --> 01:08:46,125
modifying the open source piece

1319
01:08:46,125 --> 01:08:46,125
modifying standard open source Linux

1320
01:08:46,125 --> 01:08:47,584
the proprietary software.

1321
01:08:47,584 --> 01:08:47,584
DAVID HARRISON: That's

1322
01:08:47,584 --> 01:08:49,792
in the GPL licensed stuff that's

1323
01:08:49,792 --> 01:08:49,792
That was

1324
01:08:49,792 --> 01:08:50,792
and thought about.

1325
01:08:50,792 --> 01:08:54,083
SHERRI DAVIDOFF: And we also

1326
01:08:54,083 --> 01:08:56,709
We chose to take another route

1327
01:08:56,709 --> 01:08:58,083
DAVID HARRISON: Question?

1328
01:08:58,083 --> 01:08:58,083
(Inaudible question)    DAVID

1329
01:08:58,083 --> 01:09:01,334
like legitimate apps,

1330
01:09:01,334 --> 01:09:03,751
I haven't looked at a wide variety

1331
01:09:03,751 --> 01:09:03,751
But some probably would

1332
01:09:03,751 --> 01:09:04,751
like, there's.

1333
01:09:04,751 --> 01:09:04,751
AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Inaudible

1334
01:09:04,751 --> 01:09:04,751
would love

1335
01:09:04,751 --> 01:09:05,751
sending back.

1336
01:09:05,751 --> 01:09:08,501
SHERRI DAVIDOFF: We looked

1337
01:09:08,501 --> 01:09:08,501
If you play

1338
01:09:08,501 --> 01:09:09,918
we have some of that stuff.

1339
01:09:09,918 --> 01:09:09,918
AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Inaudible

1340
01:09:09,918 --> 01:09:09,918
was a great article

1341
01:09:09,918 --> 01:09:12,918
they are looking at 20 or 30 apps

1342
01:09:12,918 --> 01:09:15,459
Caller IQ, you would be able

1343
01:09:15,459 --> 01:09:15,459
You would really be able

1344
01:09:15,459 --> 01:09:17,667
to send information

1345
01:09:17,667 --> 01:09:17,667
I think we have to wrap

1346
01:09:17,667 --> 01:09:18,999
for questions after this.

1347
01:09:18,999 --> 01:09:20,375
We have business cards here.

1348
01:09:20,375 --> 01:09:22,083
We have some other swag by the door.

1349
01:09:22,083 --> 01:09:22,083
So feel free to talk to us after the talk

1350
01:09:22,083 --> 01:09:23,751
if you have any more questions.
