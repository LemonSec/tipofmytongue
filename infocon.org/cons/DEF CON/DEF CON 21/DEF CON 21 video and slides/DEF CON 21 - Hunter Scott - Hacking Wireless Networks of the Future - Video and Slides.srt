1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,417
HUNTER: Hey, everyone, thanks for coming.

2
00:00:02,417 --> 00:00:05,876
Today I want to talk about security and cognitive radio networks.

3
00:00:05,876 --> 00:00:07,501
There are a lot of companies now spending a lot

4
00:00:07,501 --> 00:00:09,999
of money on a prediction and the prediction is that

5
00:00:09,999 --> 00:00:12,751
over the next ten years the number of connected devices and

6
00:00:12,751 --> 00:00:17,250
the amount of data that they're going to use is going to increase very fast.

7
00:00:17,542 --> 00:00:21,000
So new protocol and specifications and hardware is being developed

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,501
to deal with this engineering problem of how do we add billions

9
00:00:24,501 --> 00:00:26,999
of more devices to networks that are congested,

10
00:00:26,999 --> 00:00:29,626
especially wireless networks.

11
00:00:30,709 --> 00:00:32,999
A lot of times when these new protocols are

12
00:00:32,999 --> 00:00:36,999
designed it's important to think about how we make sure data integrity

13
00:00:36,999 --> 00:00:38,834
is maintained.

14
00:00:38,999 --> 00:00:41,083
In the networks I'm going to talk about today, a lot

15
00:00:41,083 --> 00:00:43,584
of thought has gone into it.

16
00:00:44,334 --> 00:00:48,876
The way research works is we start out with a system that's deployed

17
00:00:48,876 --> 00:00:52,709
and someone discovers a problem with it and we talk about it

18
00:00:52,709 --> 00:00:56,584
and everyone freaks out and it's up to the vendor or whoever

19
00:00:56,584 --> 00:00:59,709
is responsible to repair it and everyone relaxes

20
00:00:59,709 --> 00:01:02,792
until it happens all over again.

21
00:01:02,792 --> 00:01:07,459
So we had this cyclical band aiding of almost everything that we interact

22
00:01:07,459 --> 00:01:11,250
with and in cognitive radio networks it's far enough

23
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:16,999
along to where there are deployments in the field but not so far along where

24
00:01:16,999 --> 00:01:20,834
if we discover problems with it we can actually make

25
00:01:20,834 --> 00:01:23,999
suggestions to how things should be changed

26
00:01:23,999 --> 00:01:28,876
and it's not going to affect billions of people yet.

27
00:01:28,999 --> 00:01:31,999
But to understand how we can make the improvements first we have

28
00:01:31,999 --> 00:01:35,209
to understand the system we're talking about.

29
00:01:35,667 --> 00:01:38,083
Initially we had radio, you have a transmitter and receiver

30
00:01:38,083 --> 00:01:40,999
and if you want to change how the radio operates you have

31
00:01:40,999 --> 00:01:43,999
to turn a nobody and you have to be standing physically and

32
00:01:43,999 --> 00:01:47,417
the knob turns only so far one way or the other.

33
00:01:49,792 --> 00:01:53,167
Now we can turn those nobodies in software and do it remote

34
00:01:53,167 --> 00:01:57,626
and we can control how far the nobody one way or another.

35
00:01:57,751 --> 00:02:00,999
The next logical step is cognitive radio which

36
00:02:00,999 --> 00:02:05,375
is adding a feedback loop into the radio itself and it's capable

37
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:08,999
of observing its surroundings and changing itself,

38
00:02:08,999 --> 00:02:12,459
its own parameters to optimize whatever it's trying

39
00:02:12,459 --> 00:02:15,292
to do and we have a bunch of these today,

40
00:02:15,292 --> 00:02:18,918
and we have cognitive radio network.

41
00:02:18,918 --> 00:02:21,999
So not only are individual radios talking among themselves trying

42
00:02:21,999 --> 00:02:24,999
to understand how they can increase their performance

43
00:02:24,999 --> 00:02:28,083
but they can talk to each other and they can talk back

44
00:02:28,083 --> 00:02:31,417
to a central base station somewhere and inform each other

45
00:02:31,417 --> 00:02:33,584
about what's going on so another word

46
00:02:33,584 --> 00:02:38,834
for this might be adopt active network where they're teaching each other.

47
00:02:41,876 --> 00:02:44,083
To actually send information in the layer it's important

48
00:02:44,083 --> 00:02:45,959
to understand this.

49
00:02:48,999 --> 00:02:53,292
To actually send information over to a wave, we can define it

50
00:02:53,292 --> 00:02:58,542
by three parameters, the frequency, how often a certain point reappears,

51
00:02:58,542 --> 00:03:01,209
amplitude and its phase.

52
00:03:01,626 --> 00:03:04,792
By fiddling with one or more of these parameters we call that

53
00:03:04,792 --> 00:03:08,959
modulation so that's how we represent information in a wave.

54
00:03:09,083 --> 00:03:11,167
There are lots of ways you can do modulation,

55
00:03:11,167 --> 00:03:14,542
of course, if we start out with a wave like this, the top

56
00:03:14,542 --> 00:03:17,999
is the time domain and the bottom is the frequency domain,

57
00:03:17,999 --> 00:03:21,542
if we frequency modulate this, we see the frequency is changing

58
00:03:21,542 --> 00:03:24,292
with time and in the frequency domain we can see

59
00:03:24,292 --> 00:03:26,209
the frequencies.

60
00:03:26,667 --> 00:03:30,250
There are more complicated ways to do this, too, for instance, this

61
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:33,501
is amplitude modulation and it's difficult to see how this

62
00:03:33,501 --> 00:03:36,999
is going on but there are lots of different ways and each form

63
00:03:36,999 --> 00:03:39,999
of modulation has different trade offs.

64
00:03:39,999 --> 00:03:41,999
So by changing individual parameters in each form

65
00:03:41,999 --> 00:03:44,918
of modulation we can trade off things like how fast it

66
00:03:44,918 --> 00:03:49,250
will go versus the bandwidth it will take up and stuff like that.

67
00:03:51,584 --> 00:03:54,959
So it's the "hyped" up word for what you might describe

68
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:57,959
as something that controls and commands individual

69
00:03:57,959 --> 00:03:59,876
cognitive modes.

70
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:06,375
These are examples of some of these.

71
00:04:06,709 --> 00:04:09,417
You will notice that these are all in different layers

72
00:04:09,417 --> 00:04:12,834
of abstraction so some of them are in the physical layer and some

73
00:04:12,834 --> 00:04:15,876
of them are higher and some of them depend on each other so

74
00:04:15,876 --> 00:04:18,459
the cognitive engine is trying to accomplish a task,

75
00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:22,459
let's say minimizing interference and maximizing data rate.

76
00:04:22,999 --> 00:04:26,501
We would call that its objective function and these are examples

77
00:04:26,501 --> 00:04:28,999
of inputs it would have.

78
00:04:28,999 --> 00:04:31,292
When I change those inputs it's going to change the output

79
00:04:31,292 --> 00:04:35,999
of this function and it's going to minimize or maximize this function.

80
00:04:37,375 --> 00:04:41,999
This is a three dimensional example, normally you would have way

81
00:04:41,999 --> 00:04:46,375
more than three dimensions, so it would be impossible to view it

82
00:04:46,375 --> 00:04:51,417
like this, but something it might use is gradient decent or other simple

83
00:04:51,417 --> 00:04:55,626
machine learning techniques, and this works relatively well

84
00:04:55,626 --> 00:04:58,999
but there are dangers of hitting local maximums

85
00:04:58,999 --> 00:05:03,709
and minimums instead of global and there are other techniques it can

86
00:05:03,709 --> 00:05:07,167
use, another one is game theory and this works well

87
00:05:07,167 --> 00:05:11,792
because spectrum is a resource that is being fought over by lots

88
00:05:11,792 --> 00:05:16,542
of people and we can model this in game theory easily.

89
00:05:17,876 --> 00:05:23,459
One of the ways we can do this is to try to achieve Pareto optimality.

90
00:05:23,459 --> 00:05:26,667
Which means if you've got a single cognitive radio network

91
00:05:26,667 --> 00:05:30,417
in a room by itself and there is no one else there, there

92
00:05:30,417 --> 00:05:33,667
is nothing it can do, no change it can make that

93
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:37,959
will increase its performance without decreasing the performance

94
00:05:37,959 --> 00:05:39,999
of another node.

95
00:05:39,999 --> 00:05:43,125
So this is the idealized case where you win every time.

96
00:05:43,125 --> 00:05:45,626
Now in real life, of course, this is never true.

97
00:05:45,626 --> 00:05:49,334
You're always competing with other people and maybe there are

98
00:05:49,334 --> 00:05:54,083
malicious users on the network in that case you can attempt

99
00:05:54,083 --> 00:05:58,292
to do a Nash equilibrium and you're basically trying

100
00:05:58,292 --> 00:06:01,083
to not lose ally time.

101
00:06:01,584 --> 00:06:03,542
As long as everyone is using the same strategy there

102
00:06:03,542 --> 00:06:06,375
is no change that any player can make on their strategy that

103
00:06:06,375 --> 00:06:09,999
will not tea increase the strategy of another player.

104
00:06:09,999 --> 00:06:14,209
This gets difficult to achieve in real life so you can a approximate it.

105
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:16,876
But the point is there are ways that

106
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:20,542
a cognitive convention can optimize this.

107
00:06:21,999 --> 00:06:25,542
Back in the 1800s when wireless telegraph

108
00:06:25,542 --> 00:06:27,876
was showing up.

109
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:31,709
It was really, really spectrally inefficient.

110
00:06:35,125 --> 00:06:38,250
So when operators were trying to talk to each other they would have

111
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:40,459
to listen to see if there was anyone there and

112
00:06:40,459 --> 00:06:43,459
if there wasn't then they could start talk.

113
00:06:43,876 --> 00:06:49,125
As you could imagine this ended up not working very well at all and

114
00:06:49,125 --> 00:06:54,292
in fact one of the more of common messages people sent was

115
00:06:54,292 --> 00:07:01,834
"GTO, OM, QRT, which stood for go to heck old man I'm trying to transmit.

116
00:07:01,876 --> 00:07:05,501
They would quell at each other until someone gave way

117
00:07:05,501 --> 00:07:09,375
and someone can transmit and this was a big problem when

118
00:07:09,375 --> 00:07:13,959
the Titanic started sinking, because the shore transmitters were

119
00:07:13,959 --> 00:07:18,918
interfering with the ship rescue efforts so in 1912 the FCC was created

120
00:07:18,918 --> 00:07:22,292
and this created licensing and now people realized

121
00:07:22,292 --> 00:07:26,167
to make sure that no one is interfering with each other,

122
00:07:26,167 --> 00:07:30,999
we need to have licenses, everyone is responsible for their own chunk

123
00:07:30,999 --> 00:07:35,542
of spectrum and you're not allowed to transmit where anyone else

124
00:07:35,542 --> 00:07:40,626
is ask this worked well and especially in the 80s and 90s when cell phone

125
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:45,417
companies started becoming big and they aggressively started lobbying

126
00:07:45,417 --> 00:07:49,125
Congress to divide more of the spectrum it was divided

127
00:07:49,125 --> 00:07:52,584
up and rudimentary sharing began because as long

128
00:07:52,584 --> 00:07:56,209
as you're not obviously in the same physical location

129
00:07:56,209 --> 00:07:59,918
or operating at the same time then you're not going

130
00:07:59,918 --> 00:08:02,918
to interfere with each other.

131
00:08:03,792 --> 00:08:07,751
Now recently something interesting has happened.

132
00:08:07,999 --> 00:08:13,250
Back in the 90s when people started seeing this problem of, okay,

133
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:18,083
maybe we should figure out how to ration the spectrum,

134
00:08:18,083 --> 00:08:22,417
people began setting up spectrum observe to hers,

135
00:08:22,417 --> 00:08:27,250
a spectrum a lot of the spectrum that people are buying

136
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:31,584
isn't actually used or at least not efficiently,

137
00:08:31,584 --> 00:08:36,999
so recently several years ago, the FCC after being petitioned

138
00:08:36,999 --> 00:08:40,083
by Google decided to make unlicensed

139
00:08:40,083 --> 00:08:45,375
the old analog TV channels so this is called TV white space

140
00:08:45,375 --> 00:08:49,999
and Google was the primary push of that.

141
00:08:50,083 --> 00:08:52,584
So the problem is because the licenses are not

142
00:08:52,584 --> 00:08:56,918
the same where every, the availability of stuff like white space isn't available

143
00:08:56,918 --> 00:08:59,083
everywhere so this is a plot of one channel

144
00:08:59,083 --> 00:09:02,584
across the United States and all the blue is where it's available

145
00:09:02,584 --> 00:09:05,876
and the green is where it's not available.

146
00:09:05,876 --> 00:09:07,542
So as you change channels the availability

147
00:09:07,542 --> 00:09:10,292
of the frequency changes as well.

148
00:09:10,542 --> 00:09:12,667
So this is the entire United States.

149
00:09:12,667 --> 00:09:13,459
It's a little deceiving on this plot

150
00:09:13,459 --> 00:09:17,083
because it's not plotting defensibly, it's plotting channels and colors,

151
00:09:17,083 --> 00:09:20,083
and you can see it's mostly around big cities but in the rest

152
00:09:20,083 --> 00:09:22,167
of the United States.

153
00:09:22,167 --> 00:09:24,918
Like in the middle of the desert there are no TV channels

154
00:09:24,918 --> 00:09:27,292
out there so why not use it?

155
00:09:27,292 --> 00:09:32,999
And there are several companies that have begun taking advantage of this.

156
00:09:32,999 --> 00:09:35,709
The FCC has set up specific databases

157
00:09:35,709 --> 00:09:40,292
with Microsoft and Spectrum Bridge and Google and you query these

158
00:09:40,292 --> 00:09:45,959
databases, and you tell them where you are and they will return to you a list

159
00:09:45,959 --> 00:09:50,918
of the frequencies you can use without paying for them.

160
00:09:50,918 --> 00:09:53,125
And Microsoft and Google have started using this

161
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:58,209
in something called" super wifi "which is basically taking 80211 and shifting it

162
00:09:58,209 --> 00:10:02,999
down to these frequencies down it's in UHF, so it's 500 and 600 megahertz

163
00:10:02,999 --> 00:10:07,501
And they're doing trials there are 40 installations in the United States,

164
00:10:07,501 --> 00:10:11,542
and they have trials going all over Africa, Kenya, South Africa,

165
00:10:11,542 --> 00:10:15,042
Tanzania, Singapore, Senegal, everywhere.

166
00:10:17,417 --> 00:10:21,334
This is really interesting, but there are other uses for this as well.

167
00:10:21,334 --> 00:10:23,125
There is a company in France called Sig Fox,

168
00:10:23,125 --> 00:10:26,999
rather than use this as another way to do wifi are trying to use this

169
00:10:26,999 --> 00:10:31,000
for long range wireless sensors that are really low power.

170
00:10:31,501 --> 00:10:34,083
So rather than connect people in a traditional network;

171
00:10:34,083 --> 00:10:37,751
they're connecting, for instance, farmers who need to measure

172
00:10:37,751 --> 00:10:41,250
the moisture of their field, and you've got a large area, this

173
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:44,042
is the stuff they're working on.

174
00:10:44,167 --> 00:10:46,584
So especially for these low power devices,

175
00:10:46,584 --> 00:10:49,375
we need new protocols and new ways to deal

176
00:10:49,375 --> 00:10:54,209
with these interesting physical and political properties.

177
00:10:54,459 --> 00:10:57,125
So there is another company in England called Newall that

178
00:10:57,125 --> 00:11:00,167
is developing a protocol called" Weightless "and it's

179
00:11:00,167 --> 00:11:03,667
interesting because it's set up as a special interest group,

180
00:11:03,667 --> 00:11:06,999
but as a private special interest group.

181
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:10,501
Blue Tooth did the same thing so if you want to contribute to the spec,

182
00:11:10,501 --> 00:11:13,501
you have to pay a bunch of money.

183
00:11:13,501 --> 00:11:15,292
And in the case of Blue Tooth you paid a bunch

184
00:11:15,292 --> 00:11:17,709
of money to contribute, and once they released

185
00:11:17,709 --> 00:11:20,792
the spec you can download that for free.

186
00:11:20,999 --> 00:11:24,918
Weightless is working different and if you want to read the spec,

187
00:11:24,918 --> 00:11:28,667
they have now released version 1.0; it costs almost $1,000, and

188
00:11:28,667 --> 00:11:31,999
they claim it's an open spec so I'm not really sure how

189
00:11:31,999 --> 00:11:34,834
that works, but I hope they perhaps take a turn

190
00:11:34,834 --> 00:11:37,751
because I'm sure there would be people interested

191
00:11:37,751 --> 00:11:41,751
in knowing how this works and poking around at it.

192
00:11:41,792 --> 00:11:43,542
Now I briefly want to talk about the kinds

193
00:11:43,542 --> 00:11:47,999
of attacks that specifically apply to cognitive radio networks.

194
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:50,501
A lot of traditional network attacks will work

195
00:11:50,501 --> 00:11:55,167
on cognitive radio networks but they work in different ways.

196
00:11:55,751 --> 00:11:57,999
I'm not going to numerate every single attack

197
00:11:57,999 --> 00:12:00,626
but give you the kind of things you have to think

198
00:12:00,626 --> 00:12:02,834
about what dealing with networks like this

199
00:12:02,834 --> 00:12:05,667
because it takes different thinking.

200
00:12:05,999 --> 00:12:09,959
I'm sure one attack everyone in here is familiar with is a replay attack,

201
00:12:09,959 --> 00:12:12,999
you take traffic off the network and store it and play it back

202
00:12:12,999 --> 00:12:14,999
at a regular time.

203
00:12:16,083 --> 00:12:22,083
In a regular network that can be bad if you don't handle it right.

204
00:12:22,709 --> 00:12:24,501
But in a cognitive network it can be a good thing

205
00:12:24,501 --> 00:12:26,999
because it's constantly deciding how it can optimize and make better

206
00:12:26,999 --> 00:12:29,709
improvements and not interfere with others.

207
00:12:29,709 --> 00:12:31,999
So if it sees traffic returning to it that it

208
00:12:31,999 --> 00:12:35,542
is already seeing it may assume one of two things, there

209
00:12:35,542 --> 00:12:39,959
is a routing problem, especially if it's an ad hoc network or there

210
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:43,999
is a weird RF thing happening, perhaps it's seeing a reflection

211
00:12:43,999 --> 00:12:48,709
off a large surface or something and it may adjust for it.

212
00:12:48,709 --> 00:12:50,709
So taking advantage the assumptions that

213
00:12:50,709 --> 00:12:55,250
the cognitive engine makes is a large attack surface.

214
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:59,918
One of the more obvious methods you may think of is changing

215
00:12:59,918 --> 00:13:04,959
the observation that individual nodes can see.

216
00:13:05,083 --> 00:13:08,751
So if a legitimate node can observe an incumbent on some channel and

217
00:13:08,751 --> 00:13:11,709
the way it would do that, several different ways,

218
00:13:11,709 --> 00:13:15,999
it can use something as simple as energy thresholding.

219
00:13:15,999 --> 00:13:18,626
So if there is a power above a threshold that decides there

220
00:13:18,626 --> 00:13:21,876
is a person there, or it can use more complicated ways,

221
00:13:21,876 --> 00:13:25,250
for instance, cyclostationery analysis or wave load analysis

222
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:28,667
and it can characterize the signal more.

223
00:13:28,751 --> 00:13:31,250
I'm not going to go into this work because the math

224
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:35,542
is hairy but it discovers there is a person there, and it will forward

225
00:13:35,542 --> 00:13:39,250
the message along the network until it hits a compromised node

226
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:41,792
in which case the message can be changed

227
00:13:41,792 --> 00:13:45,876
and once this is forwarded along to the base station this can cause

228
00:13:45,876 --> 00:13:50,999
different decisions to be made and this can do one of the two things.

229
00:13:50,999 --> 00:13:52,834
First of all it means the real incumbent is going

230
00:13:52,834 --> 00:13:56,209
to be ignored and you can turn the network into your own jammer

231
00:13:56,209 --> 00:13:58,876
and the other advantage is that you don't have

232
00:13:58,876 --> 00:14:01,918
to transmit anything to make it work.

233
00:14:01,918 --> 00:14:04,999
So rather than setting up your own radio and potentially be try

234
00:14:04,999 --> 00:14:08,250
angulated or something, you can simply change traffic

235
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:11,918
to change what happen to be observations.

236
00:14:12,209 --> 00:14:16,334
A simpler version would be routing disruption, another attack that

237
00:14:16,334 --> 00:14:18,999
is well documented in traditional networks

238
00:14:18,999 --> 00:14:23,667
but if a node starts dropping packets or completely drops off the network,

239
00:14:23,667 --> 00:14:26,959
then this can be really bad for the cognitive engine

240
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:31,083
because if that particular area physically where the node is located

241
00:14:31,083 --> 00:14:36,959
is collecting valuable data then it's now blind in that part of the network.

242
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:42,334
So that can drastically change how the entire network will behave.

243
00:14:42,876 --> 00:14:43,626
By the way you don't need

244
00:14:43,626 --> 00:14:46,292
a complicated exploit to make a small node especially

245
00:14:46,292 --> 00:14:49,334
the kinds that are typically used in sensor networks to act

246
00:14:49,334 --> 00:14:52,459
like a black hole, a baseball bat will work to take the node

247
00:14:52,459 --> 00:14:54,250
off the network.

248
00:14:54,999 --> 00:14:58,417
The civil attack, another originally designed for peer

249
00:14:58,417 --> 00:15:02,792
to peer networks, another idea being if you have a trust relationship

250
00:15:02,792 --> 00:15:06,626
between individual nodes or the base station that you can take

251
00:15:06,626 --> 00:15:10,626
advantage of that by taking over additional nodes or adding more

252
00:15:10,626 --> 00:15:12,542
to the network.

253
00:15:12,667 --> 00:15:15,459
So especially in these cases it's really important

254
00:15:15,459 --> 00:15:20,083
to know who you can trust information from and when you can trust that

255
00:15:20,083 --> 00:15:21,834
it's real.

256
00:15:21,999 --> 00:15:23,667
So keeping track of individual nodes and

257
00:15:23,667 --> 00:15:27,459
whether or not they're being suspicious is important.

258
00:15:27,459 --> 00:15:30,417
So if you get enough of your own nodes on the network,

259
00:15:30,417 --> 00:15:34,584
then you now have basically voting majority and you can vouch

260
00:15:34,584 --> 00:15:38,709
for compromised nodes on behalf of each other.

261
00:15:38,709 --> 00:15:41,999
In this way you can indirectly control the decisions that the network

262
00:15:41,999 --> 00:15:44,459
is going to make because you can feed it whatever you

263
00:15:44,459 --> 00:15:47,999
want it to hear and then you can get a pretty good idea of what it's going

264
00:15:47,999 --> 00:15:50,167
to have to do in response.

265
00:15:50,626 --> 00:15:55,834
A priority attack is another interesting attack that

266
00:15:55,834 --> 00:16:03,250
another interesting attack that is perhaps unique to this network.

267
00:16:03,792 --> 00:16:07,083
The idea is that you've got sensors in different places, like, let's say,

268
00:16:07,083 --> 00:16:09,999
you've got a sensor in a laboratory that's measuring,

269
00:16:09,999 --> 00:16:13,542
you know, the moisture of a fern or something and then you've got

270
00:16:13,542 --> 00:16:15,667
another sensor in the same network that

271
00:16:15,667 --> 00:16:18,999
is measuring toxic fume levels in the lab.

272
00:16:19,083 --> 00:16:22,667
Clearly the one that's measuring fume levels should be much higher priority

273
00:16:22,667 --> 00:16:25,999
than the one measuring moisture in the plant.

274
00:16:25,999 --> 00:16:29,959
So by exploiting by telling the cognitive engine that you're

275
00:16:29,959 --> 00:16:34,584
a higher priority than you are, you can derive resources away

276
00:16:34,584 --> 00:16:37,999
from places that really need it.

277
00:16:38,375 --> 00:16:40,626
Especially in these cases where you're sharing

278
00:16:40,626 --> 00:16:43,709
spectrum there is a finite amount of resources to go

279
00:16:43,709 --> 00:16:46,999
around and it's easy to clamp those off.

280
00:16:48,083 --> 00:16:52,501
Whenever people are designing hardware, especially these networks,

281
00:16:52,501 --> 00:16:55,999
it's really, really easy when you're designing small

282
00:16:55,999 --> 00:16:59,667
nodes to Rationalize weak crypt toe and the reason this

283
00:16:59,667 --> 00:17:03,834
is because if you're working on a micro controller and writing

284
00:17:03,834 --> 00:17:07,584
an assembly and you're trying to squeeze every cycle out,

285
00:17:07,584 --> 00:17:12,751
it can be easy to say, who is going to try to break into this?

286
00:17:12,751 --> 00:17:16,709
Or, it doesn't really matter if someone is able to read this traffic, and a lot

287
00:17:16,709 --> 00:17:19,083
of it comes down to speed versus security

288
00:17:19,083 --> 00:17:22,667
because in a network like this you have more overhead so

289
00:17:22,667 --> 00:17:25,501
understanding what trade off to be made is hard

290
00:17:25,501 --> 00:17:29,250
but it's important and it's easy to screw up.

291
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:32,125
Data privacy on normal networks is important, but on these networks

292
00:17:32,125 --> 00:17:35,959
is give us you more information about the nodes themselves than

293
00:17:35,959 --> 00:17:38,709
perhaps on a regular note work.

294
00:17:38,709 --> 00:17:41,709
For instance, location can be easier to discover

295
00:17:41,709 --> 00:17:45,999
for an individual node because the spectrum its observing

296
00:17:45,999 --> 00:17:48,999
is specific to where it is.

297
00:17:49,125 --> 00:17:51,751
Individual trees and buildings and stuff

298
00:17:51,751 --> 00:17:56,250
around specific nodes can drastically affect the spectrum they're observing

299
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:59,999
and you can characterize that and you can figure out where

300
00:17:59,999 --> 00:18:04,999
they are and this can be bad if you're trying to keep that secure.

301
00:18:05,709 --> 00:18:08,292
So this, I think, primary user emulation

302
00:18:08,292 --> 00:18:12,125
is the most challenging attack we're going to have to deal

303
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:15,292
with in these kinds of networks.

304
00:18:16,083 --> 00:18:20,751
I should plain a primary user in the context of the FCC.

305
00:18:20,751 --> 00:18:23,626
What they talk about is a TV transmitter who owns

306
00:18:23,626 --> 00:18:28,083
the license, they would be the primary user and everyone sharing

307
00:18:28,083 --> 00:18:31,709
the spectrum is the secondary user.

308
00:18:31,918 --> 00:18:34,792
So normally you look up the database and that tells you

309
00:18:34,792 --> 00:18:38,709
the primary users and you go, okay, if they're want on this list

310
00:18:38,709 --> 00:18:42,459
they may be a primary user so this is an exploit of technology

311
00:18:42,459 --> 00:18:46,626
and policy because the problem is as the law stands there is no way

312
00:18:46,626 --> 00:18:49,250
to authenticate a primary user so if you set

313
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:53,083
up a radio and broadcast episodes of" Happy Days "in the milled

314
00:18:53,083 --> 00:18:56,999
of network you can dos the network off the air and even though

315
00:18:56,999 --> 00:19:01,083
the network may suspect you're doing something bad there is nothing

316
00:19:01,083 --> 00:19:03,959
they can do about it because they have to get

317
00:19:03,959 --> 00:19:05,918
out of your way.

318
00:19:06,083 --> 00:19:10,999
So figuring out how to deal with this is tricky and there are papers written

319
00:19:10,999 --> 00:19:14,999
on special cases of this but no one has figured out how

320
00:19:14,999 --> 00:19:19,083
to deal with it and I think it's going to require algorithms

321
00:19:19,083 --> 00:19:22,999
for characterizing real primary users and policy change

322
00:19:22,999 --> 00:19:27,626
on how you are able to did he text them and what you can do once

323
00:19:27,626 --> 00:19:31,999
you discover they're there because at this point once you are

324
00:19:31,999 --> 00:19:35,876
dosed off, it becomes a jamming problem and you can use

325
00:19:35,876 --> 00:19:40,209
a spectrum to get around that but it's not ideal.

326
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:45,334
Those are not every possible attack, those are general ideas and similarly

327
00:19:45,334 --> 00:19:48,083
these are general ideas on countermeasures for how

328
00:19:48,083 --> 00:19:51,999
to deal with these things and not all of this has been enumerated yet

329
00:19:51,999 --> 00:19:55,667
but there are key important ideas that we're going to have to think

330
00:19:55,667 --> 00:19:58,751
of when trying to solve these issues.

331
00:19:58,999 --> 00:20:01,959
The first is using cooperative intrusion detections.

332
00:20:02,083 --> 00:20:03,999
Traditionally we see a single intrusion did

333
00:20:03,999 --> 00:20:06,834
he techs system but in the case where you've got

334
00:20:06,834 --> 00:20:09,751
a budget of nodes that are all talking to each other

335
00:20:09,751 --> 00:20:12,834
because they can inform each other, they should be able

336
00:20:12,834 --> 00:20:15,999
to inform each other about each other.

337
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:17,999
So not only are they observing the spectrum in general

338
00:20:17,999 --> 00:20:21,334
but they should be observing each other's behavior and keeping each

339
00:20:21,334 --> 00:20:23,250
other accountable.

340
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:25,626
If they observe strange traffic they need

341
00:20:25,626 --> 00:20:29,167
to adjust their functions accordingly.

342
00:20:29,959 --> 00:20:33,000
Device reputation is another important thing.

343
00:20:33,626 --> 00:20:36,999
By keeping track of the quality of the spectrum that each individual

344
00:20:36,999 --> 00:20:40,959
node is receiving again as well as their traffic, then you can build

345
00:20:40,959 --> 00:20:44,667
the trust function and you can sort of weight your decisions based

346
00:20:44,667 --> 00:20:47,417
on that and this is not only something malicious,

347
00:20:47,417 --> 00:20:51,542
if there is something physically wrong with a node and it starts reading

348
00:20:51,542 --> 00:20:55,250
a weird spectrum that's another reason why you need to know, okay,

349
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:59,792
we should factor these observations less into our decisions.

350
00:21:00,501 --> 00:21:04,999
And device location, again, is another important aspect for this,

351
00:21:04,999 --> 00:21:10,834
because physically physical security on nodes like this is a big deal.

352
00:21:11,083 --> 00:21:14,584
Having physical access to them, even a single node can significantly

353
00:21:14,584 --> 00:21:19,167
affect the network and change the decisions that are being made.

354
00:21:20,125 --> 00:21:21,999
So why does this matter?

355
00:21:21,999 --> 00:21:24,709
Why should we work on these problems?

356
00:21:24,751 --> 00:21:28,918
This plot here has been probably seen by I would guess every major

357
00:21:28,918 --> 00:21:32,709
networking executive in the entire world and this is showing,

358
00:21:32,709 --> 00:21:34,999
of course, the mobile data predictions

359
00:21:34,999 --> 00:21:37,999
over the next couple of years.

360
00:21:37,999 --> 00:21:41,709
Cisco is predicting insane numbers, they're saying by 2020 there

361
00:21:41,709 --> 00:21:45,083
will be 50 billion devices connected together on the network,

362
00:21:45,083 --> 00:21:47,417
right now there are 10.

363
00:21:49,083 --> 00:21:52,501
There are a lot of companies that are predicting

364
00:21:52,501 --> 00:21:56,709
and freaking out and preparing for what they think is going

365
00:21:56,709 --> 00:22:00,209
to be a really big deal so it almost doesn't matter

366
00:22:00,209 --> 00:22:04,334
whether or not this actually happens, because they're sort

367
00:22:04,334 --> 00:22:10,083
of self fulfilling prophesy, so I think this is relevant either way.

368
00:22:12,584 --> 00:22:17,083
You can see the fragments right now, 3 kilohertz to 300 gigahertz so this

369
00:22:17,083 --> 00:22:20,375
is the solution, chopping it up into smaller pieces

370
00:22:20,375 --> 00:22:24,375
and we can't keep doing this and eventually we're going to have

371
00:22:24,375 --> 00:22:27,083
to figure out how to deal with this so this

372
00:22:27,083 --> 00:22:30,999
is another application I think of cognitive radio specifically

373
00:22:30,999 --> 00:22:33,375
is cell phone towers.

374
00:22:33,375 --> 00:22:36,751
As the density increases and we see the proliferation

375
00:22:36,751 --> 00:22:41,125
of femtocells, they're getting closer and closer together and

376
00:22:41,125 --> 00:22:44,542
if you've got one in every house you're going

377
00:22:44,542 --> 00:22:48,250
to have problem and manufacture these are beginning

378
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:52,626
to do simple cognitive aspects to them where they will try

379
00:22:52,626 --> 00:22:57,834
to avoid each other and I'm only seeing that as continuing to increase

380
00:22:57,834 --> 00:23:02,334
because it's going to let them be more efficient.

381
00:23:02,999 --> 00:23:04,918
So to sort of do experiments with this and play

382
00:23:04,918 --> 00:23:07,083
around with this we need tools.

383
00:23:07,083 --> 00:23:11,250
If you've ever done work in RF before, what comes to mind

384
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:14,999
is the USRP which is this neat little radio and it's

385
00:23:14,999 --> 00:23:18,584
a little expensive, the down side.

386
00:23:18,584 --> 00:23:22,083
I've written some experimental cognative engine code

387
00:23:22,083 --> 00:23:27,083
in a new radio and I have a link at the end to it if you want

388
00:23:27,083 --> 00:23:29,417
to play with it.

389
00:23:29,709 --> 00:23:32,999
This is good for acting like sort of the base station that

390
00:23:32,999 --> 00:23:36,792
will make decisions and command smaller nodes.

391
00:23:36,792 --> 00:23:38,792
However if you're trying to do experiments

392
00:23:38,792 --> 00:23:41,999
with the network then you typically need multiple nodes and maybe you

393
00:23:41,999 --> 00:23:44,584
can afford one USRP but you probably can't afford five

394
00:23:44,584 --> 00:23:45,999
of them.

395
00:23:45,999 --> 00:23:50,459
So the other end of this is the really, really cheap XB type thing which

396
00:23:50,459 --> 00:23:54,584
is a wireless module, you put data in one side and it comes

397
00:23:54,584 --> 00:23:58,417
out the other side and it's cheap so you can buy a bunch

398
00:23:58,417 --> 00:24:02,709
but they're not frequency agile and they're not customizable,

399
00:24:02,709 --> 00:24:05,999
you can't control them very well.

400
00:24:06,167 --> 00:24:08,167
So I wanted something in between.

401
00:24:09,083 --> 00:24:12,334
There wasn't really anything at the time so I built something.

402
00:24:12,876 --> 00:24:18,459
So I built this board that I called" level "and it goes from 30 megahertz

403
00:24:18,459 --> 00:24:23,792
to 400 megahertz and it outputs minimal Watts, uses a chip MI,

404
00:24:23,792 --> 00:24:27,125
and it's compatible with PI's really cool

405
00:24:27,125 --> 00:24:33,334
off the the she will mesh networking stack called Simplicity.

406
00:24:33,542 --> 00:24:37,334
It fits on the shield and they cost about $100.

407
00:24:40,542 --> 00:24:42,250
This is what it look like.

408
00:24:42,667 --> 00:24:45,709
I will go over the topology here.

409
00:24:46,292 --> 00:24:52,375
This is the CC 430 which is micro controller,

410
00:24:52,375 --> 00:25:01,417
by Texas Instruments, it's got a core in it, 110 CC 1 and it's good

411
00:25:01,417 --> 00:25:09,209
for doing low power stuff, this is an analog devices, this

412
00:25:09,209 --> 00:25:12,751
is a wide ban VCL.

413
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:18,999
Those are mixed together in this ADEX 10L, a passive mixer

414
00:25:18,999 --> 00:25:24,999
and because it uses a single antenna, it has two RF switches controlled

415
00:25:24,999 --> 00:25:27,999
by GPO on the MS 430 so you can switch

416
00:25:27,999 --> 00:25:34,125
from transmit mode and it runs through filters and ample fires.

417
00:25:34,125 --> 00:25:40,083
I added these two things that are optionally populated,

418
00:25:40,083 --> 00:25:46,999
these are directional couplers and these basically let you tap

419
00:25:46,999 --> 00:25:51,626
into the signal directly and these ADF 4351

420
00:25:51,626 --> 00:25:57,999
without going through the mixer and filters and amplifier,

421
00:25:57,999 --> 00:26:06,792
and I thought it would be cool if you could interact with other devices.

422
00:26:07,876 --> 00:26:12,209
Your wifi can't do stuff in 500 megahertz and I was working

423
00:26:12,209 --> 00:26:16,459
in TV white space and I wanted to play around with this,

424
00:26:16,459 --> 00:26:19,459
and I realize they have break out boards

425
00:26:19,459 --> 00:26:22,876
for pretty much everything and it fits right

426
00:26:22,876 --> 00:26:27,542
on there and once you've depacketized whatever you're receiving

427
00:26:27,542 --> 00:26:30,999
on the top board then you send it over serial

428
00:26:30,999 --> 00:26:36,584
to a shield which would typically do all the hard parts for you and turn it

429
00:26:36,584 --> 00:26:41,626
into 8211 or whatever you want so this is on a wifi shield and this

430
00:26:41,626 --> 00:26:44,584
is on an ether net shield.

431
00:26:46,292 --> 00:26:50,918
This board by the way is still I would consider it a prototype.

432
00:26:51,876 --> 00:26:55,626
I don't have a way to mass manufacturer them right now

433
00:26:55,626 --> 00:27:00,334
however, code and schematics are all on GitHub and I will link that

434
00:27:00,334 --> 00:27:04,751
at the end and if there is enough interest we can see what we

435
00:27:04,751 --> 00:27:06,125
can do.

436
00:27:10,209 --> 00:27:14,083
The hack RF, launched a few days ago, the Blade RF,

437
00:27:14,083 --> 00:27:19,375
on Kick Starter this year earlier, and there is another board called

438
00:27:19,375 --> 00:27:23,751
the myriad RF which is a neat little board that it's not

439
00:27:23,751 --> 00:27:26,999
as frequency agile as the other two boards

440
00:27:26,999 --> 00:27:32,542
but it's really neat and so all three of these are good tools for playing

441
00:27:32,542 --> 00:27:36,792
with this and all three of them didn't exist when I was

442
00:27:36,792 --> 00:27:42,083
designing my board which is why I didn't use any of them.

443
00:27:43,375 --> 00:27:45,709
So what's next?

444
00:27:47,167 --> 00:27:52,501
The spectrum crunch things, people will say it's I am meant

445
00:27:52,501 --> 00:27:56,292
and some will say we have more time than we

446
00:27:56,292 --> 00:28:02,709
thought, there are new techniques that people are using that may buy us

447
00:28:02,709 --> 00:28:04,584
more time.

448
00:28:06,083 --> 00:28:09,292
But here is what we know.

449
00:28:09,292 --> 00:28:11,417
We know that a lot of these companies that have

450
00:28:11,417 --> 00:28:14,375
a whole lot of money are investing a lot of money

451
00:28:14,375 --> 00:28:17,083
in cognative radio networks.

452
00:28:17,083 --> 00:28:21,501
They've been doing experiments in turning cell phone towers

453
00:28:21,501 --> 00:28:27,167
into cognative nodes and I think that we're at a unique time because,

454
00:28:27,167 --> 00:28:31,959
like I said, these are deployed to the point where there

455
00:28:31,959 --> 00:28:36,999
is actually real networks in the field right now.

456
00:28:37,250 --> 00:28:40,751
In France with Seg Fox they have at this point thousands

457
00:28:40,751 --> 00:28:44,209
of devices connect to paying customers and there are

458
00:28:44,209 --> 00:28:48,918
dozens and dozens of installations in the United States right now,

459
00:28:48,918 --> 00:28:53,918
West Virginia University just a couple of weeks ago started serving wifi

460
00:28:53,918 --> 00:28:58,542
to their dorms over TV white space and we're at this cool time where

461
00:28:58,542 --> 00:29:01,167
the networks exist but they're not used

462
00:29:01,167 --> 00:29:04,542
by so many millions of people that it's too late

463
00:29:04,542 --> 00:29:08,083
to change fundamentally how they work.

464
00:29:08,083 --> 00:29:12,209
So I think by attacking these problems and

465
00:29:12,209 --> 00:29:17,876
by trying to solve these I mean nontrivial issues,

466
00:29:17,876 --> 00:29:25,292
be it either technological or political, we can really get we can be

467
00:29:25,292 --> 00:29:33,083
on our way toward making sort of the next generation network.

468
00:29:33,999 --> 00:29:37,417
Making sure that we are able to deal with whatever the result

469
00:29:37,417 --> 00:29:40,999
of these predictions ends up being, thank you.

470
00:29:40,999 --> 00:29:43,334
(Applause.) If you want code, or schematics or slides,

471
00:29:43,334 --> 00:29:46,083
then there's where you get it.
