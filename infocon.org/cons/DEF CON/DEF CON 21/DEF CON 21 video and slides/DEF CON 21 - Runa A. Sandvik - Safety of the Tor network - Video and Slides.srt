1
00:00:00,042 --> 00:00:02,042
RUNA SANDVIK: Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:02,542 --> 00:00:05,125
I would like to have a show of hands.

3
00:00:05,125 --> 00:00:07,751
How many of you have heard about or used Tor.

4
00:00:09,542 --> 00:00:10,999
(laughter).

5
00:00:12,751 --> 00:00:14,999
How many of you run a relay?

6
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:18,459
(applause).

7
00:00:23,709 --> 00:00:27,250
So my talk is about the safety of the Tor network.

8
00:00:37,334 --> 00:00:39,626
My name is Runa Sandvik.

9
00:00:48,042 --> 00:00:53,876
We have contractors working full time and on tour on other projects.

10
00:00:54,167 --> 00:00:56,167
We have volunteers all over the world.

11
00:00:56,167 --> 00:00:59,834
We're also hiring, if anyone is looking for a job, come see me after.

12
00:01:00,626 --> 00:01:03,876
The goal of Tor is to express free speech

13
00:01:03,876 --> 00:01:06,209
and privacy online.

14
00:01:15,459 --> 00:01:21,167
We've met with activists, survivors of domestic abuse, so we do a lot

15
00:01:21,167 --> 00:01:26,792
more than just developing this tiny piece of software.

16
00:01:28,083 --> 00:01:32,959
So sort of like the background for my talk, over the past two years I've

17
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:36,417
had an opportunity to travel a the lot.

18
00:01:36,584 --> 00:01:45,375
I met with activists in Beirut, journalists in Istanbul, students in DC.

19
00:01:45,999 --> 00:01:49,999
A lot of them have questions about Tor and the Tor network.

20
00:01:49,999 --> 00:01:52,959
How safe is the Tor network?

21
00:01:53,083 --> 00:01:54,999
Who are the real operators?

22
00:01:55,083 --> 00:01:57,083
What about malicious relays?

23
00:01:57,334 --> 00:01:59,876
How much network diversity is there?

24
00:02:00,083 --> 00:02:03,751
And what about the CIA, NSA, Prism, and so on.

25
00:02:03,751 --> 00:02:07,417
So I want to just comment on one straight off.

26
00:02:07,417 --> 00:02:10,250
CIA was does not run Tor.

27
00:02:10,626 --> 00:02:13,292
Tor is not a CIA honeypot.

28
00:02:13,834 --> 00:02:16,999
Tor was originally developed by the U.S.

29
00:02:16,999 --> 00:02:17,999
naval research lab.

30
00:02:18,083 --> 00:02:19,999
That was before 2000.

31
00:02:19,999 --> 00:02:23,999
Since 2002 Tor has been completely free and open source and developed

32
00:02:23,999 --> 00:02:26,167
by the Tor Project.

33
00:02:27,999 --> 00:02:30,792
So before we start kind of go deeper into these topics,

34
00:02:30,792 --> 00:02:32,999
I'll kind of start with a quick introduction

35
00:02:32,999 --> 00:02:34,999
into onion routing.

36
00:02:37,209 --> 00:02:41,083
You can run Tor as a relay or run Tor as a client.

37
00:02:41,292 --> 00:02:46,501
When you run as a relay, you set it up on a computer or a raspberry pie

38
00:02:46,501 --> 00:02:51,918
or whatever it is, and you can decide to run it as an exit relay or

39
00:02:51,918 --> 00:02:54,083
a nonexit relay.

40
00:02:54,083 --> 00:02:56,334
So you can decide whether or not you want Tor users

41
00:02:56,334 --> 00:03:00,167
to exit onto the public Internet from your computer.

42
00:03:00,709 --> 00:03:05,334
In the case you're not running an exit, you'll be calling what's called a nonexit.

43
00:03:05,375 --> 00:03:08,999
That nonexit could also be what's called a guard relay, which

44
00:03:08,999 --> 00:03:12,250
is the first server that users connect to.

45
00:03:12,999 --> 00:03:17,959
So running Tor as a client, you download it onto the computer,

46
00:03:17,959 --> 00:03:23,417
open it up, and your Tor client will then, first off, download the list,

47
00:03:23,417 --> 00:03:25,542
the consensus.

48
00:03:25,542 --> 00:03:28,667
Download the list of all the relays in the network.

49
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:35,876
And out of those roughly 4,000 relays right now, it will pick three guard relays.

50
00:03:35,999 --> 00:03:38,999
For the next two to three months, it will only choose

51
00:03:38,999 --> 00:03:43,083
between those three when it chooses the first hop.

52
00:03:43,501 --> 00:03:46,999
So after choosing that guard relay, it will choose the middle relay and

53
00:03:46,999 --> 00:03:48,834
the exit relay.

54
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:51,542
After that, Tor will set up a connection

55
00:03:51,542 --> 00:03:55,125
between your computer and the guard relay and negotiate

56
00:03:55,125 --> 00:03:57,999
a short term session key.

57
00:03:58,083 --> 00:04:00,334
It will then connect through the first server

58
00:04:00,334 --> 00:04:04,375
to the second server and negotiate a second short term key and it

59
00:04:04,375 --> 00:04:07,667
will do the same for the exit relay.

60
00:04:07,667 --> 00:04:10,375
When the whole circuit, the connection from you

61
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:14,834
to the last from you to the destination website is set up,

62
00:04:14,834 --> 00:04:20,417
the data you sent, for example, I want to visit Twitter.com will be wrapped

63
00:04:20,417 --> 00:04:23,375
in three different layers.

64
00:04:23,834 --> 00:04:25,959
You sent the packet from your computer

65
00:04:25,959 --> 00:04:29,083
to the guard relay and the guard relay will peel

66
00:04:29,083 --> 00:04:33,459
off that third outermost layer and say the packet came from you

67
00:04:33,459 --> 00:04:36,834
and going to somebody else in Tor.

68
00:04:37,083 --> 00:04:39,083
So they'll send the data off, send this blob of data

69
00:04:39,083 --> 00:04:41,167
off to the second relay.

70
00:04:41,375 --> 00:04:43,459
Second relay will peel off that second layer, see that

71
00:04:43,459 --> 00:04:46,250
the packet came from somewhere in Tor.

72
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:49,417
It's going to somewhere in Tor, but that's all it knows.

73
00:04:49,626 --> 00:04:53,999
So we send it off to the third exit relay, the third relay the exit relay, which

74
00:04:53,999 --> 00:04:58,584
will peel off that final layer, see that it will go to Twitter.com.

75
00:04:59,584 --> 00:05:02,918
In this model there is no single hop that

76
00:05:02,918 --> 00:05:06,709
will see what you are doing online.

77
00:05:06,999 --> 00:05:11,999
Now, the challenge here is if someone, the same person, owns

78
00:05:11,999 --> 00:05:17,375
the guard relay and the exit relay, that person can see what you're

79
00:05:17,375 --> 00:05:19,459
doing online.

80
00:05:19,459 --> 00:05:22,792
That person can see that you are using Tor to visit Twitter.com.

81
00:05:23,459 --> 00:05:26,999
Another issue is the exit relay.

82
00:05:26,999 --> 00:05:32,876
The exit relay operator can look at any traffic going from her relay

83
00:05:32,876 --> 00:05:35,999
to the public Internet.

84
00:05:36,083 --> 00:05:38,209
I'll get back to that later on.

85
00:05:38,999 --> 00:05:43,459
So at the moment there's roughly 4,000 relays

86
00:05:43,459 --> 00:05:48,375
in the Tor network pushing around 2,500 megabytes

87
00:05:48,375 --> 00:05:51,667
a second in aggregate.

88
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:56,667
And you would think that 4,000 relays, we have 600,000 daily users.

89
00:05:56,667 --> 00:06:02,751
You think 4,000 relays is a good number if you look

90
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:12,792
at this graph, out of 1,000 are exit relays and only 1,000 are guard relays.

91
00:06:12,918 --> 00:06:16,626
So when your Tor client is trying to choose which servers

92
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:20,375
to send traffic through, it only has 1,000 or less options

93
00:06:20,375 --> 00:06:23,834
for the first hop and the third hop.

94
00:06:26,375 --> 00:06:30,167
I figured a lot of you will probably want to know

95
00:06:30,167 --> 00:06:34,999
about how Prism or other spying programs factor.

96
00:06:34,999 --> 00:06:39,959
And Tor was originally designed to protect government

97
00:06:39,959 --> 00:06:45,417
communications, to hide where you are and who you're

98
00:06:45,417 --> 00:06:47,667
talking to.

99
00:06:47,918 --> 00:06:50,417
So Tor can't hide the fact that you're talking,

100
00:06:50,417 --> 00:06:54,501
how much you're talking or when you're talking.

101
00:06:54,834 --> 00:06:56,999
What Tor can give you location anonymity.

102
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,501
If you're here at DEF CON and you're using Tor

103
00:06:59,501 --> 00:07:01,834
to connect to Twitter.

104
00:07:01,918 --> 00:07:02,999
Twitter will see you're the one logging

105
00:07:02,999 --> 00:07:04,999
on because you have a user name and password,

106
00:07:04,999 --> 00:07:07,584
but they won't know that you're here.

107
00:07:08,999 --> 00:07:11,709
Like I mentioned, if the same person owns

108
00:07:11,709 --> 00:07:17,459
the guard relay and the exit relay, they can see what you are doing online.

109
00:07:17,918 --> 00:07:21,125
And recently it's sort of, you know, after Snowden leaked

110
00:07:21,125 --> 00:07:26,209
all of these documents we learned that there are countries working together

111
00:07:26,209 --> 00:07:28,999
on other spying programs.

112
00:07:29,125 --> 00:07:32,125
So now the issue the concern is not so much who is running

113
00:07:32,125 --> 00:07:34,999
the relays, but who owns the links?

114
00:07:35,083 --> 00:07:36,751
Who controls the AS's?

115
00:07:36,751 --> 00:07:38,999
Who controls the Internet exchange points?

116
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:42,751
It's not necessarily about the relays.

117
00:07:42,999 --> 00:07:46,083
So this kind of all fits into whether or not we should,

118
00:07:46,083 --> 00:07:50,125
you know, consider different threats, if we should reconsider

119
00:07:50,125 --> 00:07:52,999
the threat model for Tor.

120
00:07:54,459 --> 00:07:59,751
This is a paper that is that it will be published later this year that

121
00:07:59,751 --> 00:08:02,083
a group at the U.S.

122
00:08:02,083 --> 00:08:03,626
Naval research lab worked on.

123
00:08:03,834 --> 00:08:06,083
It's called The Users Get Routed, Traffic Correlation

124
00:08:06,083 --> 00:08:08,667
by Tor Realistic Adversaries.

125
00:08:08,999 --> 00:08:11,459
They took for the way it works right now

126
00:08:11,459 --> 00:08:15,083
and looked at what happens if you're sending your

127
00:08:15,083 --> 00:08:18,292
at that time through relays that it happened

128
00:08:18,292 --> 00:08:22,334
to be controlled by the same entity, by the same AS, or

129
00:08:22,334 --> 00:08:27,542
in similar Internet exchange points or by countries that are now known

130
00:08:27,542 --> 00:08:31,999
to work together on different spying programs.

131
00:08:33,959 --> 00:08:37,125
We are sort of considering how we can

132
00:08:37,125 --> 00:08:39,417
approach this.

133
00:08:39,417 --> 00:08:42,083
We're sort of trying to figure out if changing

134
00:08:42,083 --> 00:08:47,083
the way Tor selects relays is something that we should actually do

135
00:08:47,083 --> 00:08:50,999
or if users are safer now than if we were to choose

136
00:08:50,999 --> 00:08:53,751
a different algorithm.

137
00:09:12,417 --> 00:09:14,709
This one is from Compass.TorProject.org.

138
00:09:22,375 --> 00:09:26,083
It shows your exit relay and your middle relay.

139
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:33,709
There is a 25% chance your first server will be in the U.S.

140
00:09:33,918 --> 00:09:37,751
There's a 23% chance your middle he server will be in the U.S.

141
00:09:37,792 --> 00:09:41,792
and a 30% chance you will exit in the U.S.

142
00:09:42,834 --> 00:09:45,542
Below that there is a 29% chance you will enter

143
00:09:45,542 --> 00:09:49,125
in Germany, that your middle relay will be in Germany, but only

144
00:09:49,125 --> 00:09:52,334
a 6% chance you will exit in Germany.

145
00:09:52,334 --> 00:09:57,834
On the top of the list is U.S., Germany, Netherlands, France, Sweden.

146
00:09:58,542 --> 00:10:02,792
So we have 4,000 relays and 150 different countries.

147
00:10:03,167 --> 00:10:06,167
But Tor will look at the relays that are offering

148
00:10:06,167 --> 00:10:11,250
the most bandwidth when choosing which relays to use for its path.

149
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:12,999
It doesn't look at the countries.

150
00:10:12,999 --> 00:10:14,542
It looks at the bandwidth.

151
00:10:18,334 --> 00:10:21,999
That means that we may not actually have as much diversity

152
00:10:21,999 --> 00:10:24,999
as we would like to, because all the relays are

153
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:27,792
in countries like the U.S.

154
00:10:27,792 --> 00:10:33,250
and Germany where bandwidth is free and where hosting providers are

155
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:38,250
actually happy with us setting up relays.

156
00:10:39,626 --> 00:10:43,250
So I wanted to figure out who the relay operators are.

157
00:10:44,667 --> 00:10:46,999
Has the NSA ever set up.

158
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,999
All the data, all consensus documents that has been

159
00:10:51,999 --> 00:10:55,959
generated since 2007 is all on matrix.TorProject.org.

160
00:10:58,125 --> 00:11:02,125
Who owns the IP addresses for all of these relays?

161
00:11:05,918 --> 00:11:09,959
I did not find any government entities running relays.

162
00:11:09,999 --> 00:11:17,876
That means one, we're not data centers, but also maybe they're not running

163
00:11:17,876 --> 00:11:20,334
relays at all.

164
00:11:20,584 --> 00:11:23,292
We know about all the spying programs.

165
00:11:23,292 --> 00:11:27,250
We know they have access to links to Internet exchange points.

166
00:11:27,501 --> 00:11:30,167
They have connections all over the world.

167
00:11:30,334 --> 00:11:34,667
Why would they need to run relay wouldn't necessarily have

168
00:11:34,667 --> 00:11:36,709
to run relays.

169
00:11:42,083 --> 00:11:48,999
A couple of interesting relays that did pop up was TBRAG.

170
00:11:51,626 --> 00:11:57,542
If you're on our mailing list, you would see this name pop up.

171
00:12:02,209 --> 00:12:06,999
TBRAG was the nickname of a few Tor relays that were running

172
00:12:06,999 --> 00:12:08,999
inside China.

173
00:12:09,709 --> 00:12:12,584
We're running as Tor exit relays in China.

174
00:12:15,292 --> 00:12:20,417
20,000 different IP addresses associated with it.

175
00:12:20,751 --> 00:12:23,709
Now, I don't know who inside China would have access

176
00:12:23,709 --> 00:12:28,542
to be able to set up a Tor exit relay, and two, have 20,000 IP addresses

177
00:12:28,542 --> 00:12:33,083
in a year, my guesses is government, university maybe.

178
00:12:33,083 --> 00:12:34,999
But we don't know.

179
00:12:34,999 --> 00:12:38,876
We never actually caught this relay doing anything malicious.

180
00:12:39,209 --> 00:12:42,083
After a year, it sort of just fell off the grid and we haven't seen

181
00:12:42,083 --> 00:12:43,584
it since.

182
00:12:44,834 --> 00:12:49,417
A couple years later Trotsky popped up.

183
00:12:49,417 --> 00:12:53,250
It was the name of a number of a couple thousand relays

184
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:59,999
in eastern Europe, all running on sort of dial up or at least offering very, very,

185
00:12:59,999 --> 00:13:03,250
very little bandwidth to Tor.

186
00:13:03,626 --> 00:13:08,083
So there was it wasn't an exit.

187
00:13:08,083 --> 00:13:14,083
There was no contact information given as to who were the real operators.

188
00:13:14,999 --> 00:13:17,834
At that point we decided to take it out of the consensus

189
00:13:17,834 --> 00:13:20,876
because we believed it might be a botnet.

190
00:13:21,334 --> 00:13:24,999
We haven't really been able to figure out whether it was a botnet,

191
00:13:24,999 --> 00:13:29,501
but we only saw Trotsky for two or three weeks and that was it.

192
00:13:30,334 --> 00:13:34,918
When I say take out of the consensus, we have a way, and I'll get back

193
00:13:34,918 --> 00:13:37,999
to that later, to when we see that there are relays

194
00:13:37,999 --> 00:13:40,584
misbehaving, we have a way to mark them

195
00:13:40,584 --> 00:13:44,584
as bad and then take them out of the consensus.

196
00:13:44,584 --> 00:13:51,083
When a client is down the list of the Tor relays,

197
00:13:51,083 --> 00:13:58,999
it does not choose bad exits for its circuit.

198
00:13:59,999 --> 00:14:03,876
So Orbot is the Tor for Android.

199
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:08,459
So you can run Tor as a client on your tablet and you can browse

200
00:14:08,459 --> 00:14:10,167
through Tor.

201
00:14:10,501 --> 00:14:13,999
You can also run as a relay on your air service.

202
00:14:13,999 --> 00:14:18,083
I saw a number of nicknames with the Orbot nickname popping

203
00:14:18,083 --> 00:14:20,999
up in the Middle East.

204
00:14:20,999 --> 00:14:24,959
There were a lot of users with normal phones, smart phones.

205
00:14:24,999 --> 00:14:28,792
Apparently a lot of them set up relays a couple years ago as well.

206
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:32,375
So there are a lot of different groups sort

207
00:14:32,375 --> 00:14:37,999
of running relays there are those who run relays on a raspberry pie there are

208
00:14:37,999 --> 00:14:43,584
those that try and run bigger groups in the case of Orbot or Trotsky that may

209
00:14:43,584 --> 00:14:46,250
or may not be malicious.

210
00:14:46,751 --> 00:14:50,375
Then there is the groups that are sort of supporting the Tor network

211
00:14:50,375 --> 00:14:54,626
in a completely different way and in a very, very good way.

212
00:14:59,626 --> 00:15:04,542
Torservers.net is a German nonprofit whose only goal

213
00:15:04,542 --> 00:15:08,918
is to increase network diversities.

214
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:15,375
They will take donations and spend that money on relays for the Tor network,

215
00:15:15,375 --> 00:15:21,792
primarily Tor exit relays, which is when you saw the list of, you know,

216
00:15:21,792 --> 00:15:27,083
there's a 23% chance that you'll exit in the U.S.

217
00:15:27,083 --> 00:15:29,083
or in the Netherlands, most of those relays actually belong

218
00:15:29,083 --> 00:15:30,999
to Torservers.net.

219
00:15:32,999 --> 00:15:37,083
So when you're use it go Tor, you are more likely to end

220
00:15:37,083 --> 00:15:40,626
up using a relay owned by Torservers.net or one

221
00:15:40,626 --> 00:15:46,083
of the other groups that I'll show, because they're running so many relays

222
00:15:46,083 --> 00:15:50,667
and because they're offering so much bandwidth.

223
00:15:50,792 --> 00:15:53,999
You're more likely to use relays that are run

224
00:15:53,999 --> 00:15:59,501
by people that we trust rather than some random guy in, I don't know,

225
00:15:59,501 --> 00:16:02,083
the UK, for example.

226
00:16:03,083 --> 00:16:08,542
They also run relays offering a lot of bandwidth, if you create

227
00:16:08,542 --> 00:16:13,334
a list looking at which relays offer the most bandwidth,

228
00:16:13,334 --> 00:16:18,083
the Computer Club would come up as Number 2.

229
00:16:21,792 --> 00:16:23,083
(applause).

230
00:16:26,751 --> 00:16:30,999
Another group is BFRI in Sweden.

231
00:16:32,999 --> 00:16:37,083
I don't think they have nonprofit yet, but they managed

232
00:16:37,083 --> 00:16:40,250
to get everything together and they're able

233
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:44,999
to accept donations and put the money towards actually running

234
00:16:44,999 --> 00:16:47,584
high bandwidth relays.

235
00:16:47,999 --> 00:16:50,584
Noistour out of San Francisco.

236
00:16:50,999 --> 00:16:52,999
They will also take donations.

237
00:16:54,292 --> 00:16:57,209
They will also take donations in Bitpoint.

238
00:16:57,501 --> 00:16:59,834
If you can't run a relay, maybe you can donate

239
00:16:59,834 --> 00:17:02,999
to someone who can actually set it up for you.

240
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:18,292
So malicious relays: There are, I guess, three groups of malicious relays.

241
00:17:18,292 --> 00:17:21,542
The first one is malicious, but not intentional,

242
00:17:21,542 --> 00:17:26,417
meaning that someone set up an exit relay and they have,

243
00:17:26,417 --> 00:17:30,792
you know, open DNS or they have an antivirus that

244
00:17:30,792 --> 00:17:33,999
is blocking certain sites.

245
00:17:34,083 --> 00:17:37,542
While they may feel safe using that, having gone

246
00:17:37,542 --> 00:17:42,375
on a Tor exit relay means that users Tor users will also sort of end

247
00:17:42,375 --> 00:17:45,083
up with the same filter.

248
00:17:45,083 --> 00:17:48,375
So if they can't visit Google.com, then any Tor user will be unable

249
00:17:48,375 --> 00:17:50,626
to visit Google.com.

250
00:17:52,542 --> 00:17:57,083
In those cases we try to contact the relay operators.

251
00:17:57,209 --> 00:18:00,501
And when you are setting up a Tor relay you can sort of put

252
00:18:00,501 --> 00:18:04,792
in your contact information if you want, and if something is wrong,

253
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:07,417
we know how to contact you.

254
00:18:09,209 --> 00:18:13,999
So we contact these relay operators and ask what's going on and see

255
00:18:13,999 --> 00:18:19,959
if maybe they can just reconfigure their computer to not sensor users.

256
00:18:19,959 --> 00:18:23,083
The second category is straight-up malicious,

257
00:18:23,083 --> 00:18:27,709
those that try and strip off SSL or do some other sort of man

258
00:18:27,709 --> 00:18:29,959
in the middling.

259
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:41,584
We try to contact when there is contact information given,

260
00:18:41,584 --> 00:18:44,626
but if they're found to actually be just malicious and

261
00:18:44,626 --> 00:18:49,834
they don't have contact information, we'll just take them out of the list.

262
00:18:49,999 --> 00:18:53,292
The third category is passive, sort of more malicious,

263
00:18:53,292 --> 00:18:56,626
but not necessarily detectable.

264
00:18:56,876 --> 00:18:58,792
They may be logging.

265
00:18:58,999 --> 00:19:05,667
I mention when you are using Tor, traffic from you to the exit relay

266
00:19:05,667 --> 00:19:10,292
is visible to the exit relay operator.

267
00:19:10,334 --> 00:19:12,999
It means that the exit relay operator can see what

268
00:19:12,999 --> 00:19:15,125
people are doing online.

269
00:19:15,125 --> 00:19:16,999
They won't know necessarily who is doing what,

270
00:19:16,999 --> 00:19:21,876
but they'll see what people are doing, what websites people are visiting.

271
00:19:21,876 --> 00:19:25,584
In some cases people set up exit relays just to log

272
00:19:25,584 --> 00:19:28,292
all of this information.

273
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:31,667
That is not something that we can actually at the text.

274
00:19:31,667 --> 00:19:32,667
That is a risk.

275
00:19:32,667 --> 00:19:37,501
Just a risk to be aware of, but I would say that it's probably safer

276
00:19:37,501 --> 00:19:41,125
to use Tor than not these days.

277
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:47,876
So a question I often get is how bad can it get?

278
00:19:47,918 --> 00:19:50,501
You know, you're using Tor, you have to head

279
00:19:50,501 --> 00:19:54,459
up on a malicious exit relay, how bad can it get?

280
00:19:54,999 --> 00:19:57,501
My answer is that it depends.

281
00:19:57,501 --> 00:19:59,209
I know that's usually an answer that you would hear

282
00:19:59,209 --> 00:20:01,125
from a lawyer, but it really does agenda

283
00:20:01,125 --> 00:20:03,999
on what you're doing and for how long you're to go it and

284
00:20:03,999 --> 00:20:06,999
whether or not you're actually logging on.

285
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:10,417
Say you're using Tor to access Twitter.

286
00:20:10,417 --> 00:20:12,584
You go to Twitter.com and your browser gives you

287
00:20:12,584 --> 00:20:15,501
a warning about a fake certificate.

288
00:20:17,125 --> 00:20:20,292
Now, if you choose to accept that certificate and log on,

289
00:20:20,292 --> 00:20:23,542
you're giving your adversary, your attacker, your user name

290
00:20:23,542 --> 00:20:26,501
and your password and you have lost.

291
00:20:26,834 --> 00:20:30,999
That is true whether you're using Tor or not.

292
00:20:32,417 --> 00:20:37,167
In the other case, if the person is just logging traffic and you're not

293
00:20:37,167 --> 00:20:40,918
logging in anywhere, and you're not communicating any

294
00:20:40,918 --> 00:20:45,918
sensitive information, that person will just get lots of random data, lots

295
00:20:45,918 --> 00:20:49,918
of websites like you're visiting, but not necessarily a way

296
00:20:49,918 --> 00:20:52,459
to tie that back to you.

297
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,209
Another thing to note is Tor, when creating those circuits,

298
00:20:58,209 --> 00:21:02,167
when choosing those three relays and using them to visit

299
00:21:02,167 --> 00:21:06,918
all the websites that you're visiting, Tor will choose a new path

300
00:21:06,918 --> 00:21:10,250
for your traffic every ten minutes.

301
00:21:10,999 --> 00:21:13,999
So if you're visiting Twitter and you spend, I don't know,

302
00:21:13,999 --> 00:21:15,999
20 minutes on Twitter and you open a new tab

303
00:21:15,999 --> 00:21:19,834
in your browser, Tor will create a new circuit for you.

304
00:21:19,959 --> 00:21:22,417
Whenever Twitter has to open a new TCP connection to pull

305
00:21:22,417 --> 00:21:26,334
in new content, Tor will open a new connection for you.

306
00:21:27,999 --> 00:21:30,167
I don't know how to best answer this question how bad

307
00:21:30,167 --> 00:21:31,999
can it get, because it really does depend

308
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:33,876
on what you're doing.

309
00:21:33,876 --> 00:21:36,751
I think in a lot of cases it's probably better

310
00:21:36,751 --> 00:21:40,375
to use Tor than to not to use Tor.

311
00:21:40,375 --> 00:21:43,209
And the threats to Tor are pretty similar to using

312
00:21:43,209 --> 00:21:47,834
the open wireless network at Starbucks or elsewhere.

313
00:21:49,999 --> 00:21:52,918
So we have a couple of different tools for sort

314
00:21:52,918 --> 00:21:55,959
of finding these malicious relays.

315
00:21:55,999 --> 00:21:59,999
The first one is called the consensus tracker,

316
00:21:59,999 --> 00:22:05,292
which we created somewhere between the time we saw TPRAG crop

317
00:22:05,292 --> 00:22:07,667
up and Trotzky.

318
00:22:08,083 --> 00:22:14,999
It is a script that every hour it will look at the list of relays are new,

319
00:22:14,999 --> 00:22:19,584
which relays just joined the network.

320
00:22:20,083 --> 00:22:22,125
Send us an e mail.

321
00:22:22,125 --> 00:22:25,999
Anyone can look at the list of new relays joining the network.

322
00:22:26,918 --> 00:22:33,459
So the information we get is sort of the IP address, the port, which ports,

323
00:22:33,459 --> 00:22:39,999
if it allows exit to, content information if that has been set.

324
00:22:39,999 --> 00:22:42,459
Just sort of basic info.

325
00:22:42,999 --> 00:22:45,375
It doesn't really check for maliciousness,

326
00:22:45,375 --> 00:22:49,083
but if we suddenly have, like, 1,000 relays pop up in Syria; it's

327
00:22:49,083 --> 00:22:53,125
at least something we can monitor and keep an eye on.

328
00:22:57,083 --> 00:23:00,999
We created Snakes on a Tour, TOAT.

329
00:23:06,083 --> 00:23:12,792
It will allow you to check for SSL certificates or any sort

330
00:23:12,792 --> 00:23:18,667
of tampering with DNS, any other types of sensor ship

331
00:23:18,667 --> 00:23:26,250
and it was written in python, so it is no longer maintained.

332
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:34,083
We have been working on the open observatory

333
00:23:34,083 --> 00:23:36,999
for network nervous.

334
00:23:40,626 --> 00:23:44,167
It will check for censorship essentially.

335
00:23:44,959 --> 00:23:48,999
Hopefully, in six months or so, you know I probe will able

336
00:23:48,999 --> 00:23:53,999
to do what SOAT once good so we can actively check for malicious relays

337
00:23:53,999 --> 00:23:56,584
or misbehaving relays.

338
00:23:57,918 --> 00:24:01,834
The Tor we have is SSL checker.

339
00:24:05,334 --> 00:24:10,834
It will take the list of exit relays and a list of URL's that you have given

340
00:24:10,834 --> 00:24:15,709
it, say Twitter and Gmail.com, and it will connect to the exit relays

341
00:24:15,709 --> 00:24:19,999
and download the SSL certificate and then it will do the same

342
00:24:19,999 --> 00:24:23,292
over non Tor and compare the two.

343
00:24:23,834 --> 00:24:26,375
If there is a difference, it will give you a warning.

344
00:24:34,459 --> 00:24:38,999
To be able to check for other malicious behavior

345
00:24:38,999 --> 00:24:46,417
in the future, we hope, so there's, like, three I guess three topics that I sort

346
00:24:46,417 --> 00:24:50,334
of wanted to touch on that I hope that you

347
00:24:50,334 --> 00:24:53,876
will leave this talk with.

348
00:24:54,918 --> 00:24:57,918
One: I want you to use Tor.

349
00:24:57,918 --> 00:25:00,542
It seemed like a lot of people were already using Tor.

350
00:25:00,542 --> 00:25:02,876
In the case that you're not, please to.

351
00:25:03,083 --> 00:25:05,999
We already see that anonymity loves company.

352
00:25:05,999 --> 00:25:08,584
The more people that use Tor, the better off you are.

353
00:25:09,542 --> 00:25:12,459
If you're the only person at DEF CON using Tor, you sort

354
00:25:12,459 --> 00:25:14,083
of stand out.

355
00:25:14,083 --> 00:25:16,334
If you're one out of 12,000 people using Tor,

356
00:25:16,334 --> 00:25:18,375
the better off.

357
00:25:24,334 --> 00:25:26,876
Not a lot of people run relays.

358
00:25:27,125 --> 00:25:29,792
I'm not sure why, if it's lack of bandwidth,

359
00:25:29,792 --> 00:25:34,876
if you just don't know how, if you're worried you'll be an exit relay.

360
00:25:36,501 --> 00:25:41,459
But no matter what the reason is, you can always fund a fast relay.

361
00:25:41,459 --> 00:25:46,959
Funding Tor servers.net    We're back.

362
00:25:48,209 --> 00:25:50,125
I think you know the routine.

363
00:25:50,125 --> 00:26:00,209
What are we gonna do now?

364
00:26:00,209 --> 00:26:01,209
(applause).

365
00:26:01,209 --> 00:26:02,209
That mic is dead.

366
00:26:02,209 --> 00:26:03,918
RUNA SANDVIK: I have the mic.

367
00:26:04,167 --> 00:26:06,999
Can I just get really close, then?

368
00:26:06,999 --> 00:26:08,999
RUNA SANDVIK: No.

369
00:26:09,083 --> 00:26:12,999
Just talk really loud.

370
00:26:12,999 --> 00:26:13,999
(laughter).

371
00:26:13,999 --> 00:26:21,417
What are we gonna do?

372
00:26:21,417 --> 00:26:22,751
You all know the routine.

373
00:26:22,751 --> 00:26:24,501
Do we have any first time attendees?

374
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:26,667
Here.

375
00:26:26,667 --> 00:26:28,709
You, sir, come up.

376
00:26:28,999 --> 00:26:35,459
Your fiancÃ© is here?

377
00:26:35,459 --> 00:26:48,083
Did you want him to come up?

378
00:26:48,083 --> 00:26:49,125
RUNA SANDVIK: No.

379
00:26:49,125 --> 00:26:50,125
SSL certificate.

380
00:26:50,125 --> 00:26:51,125
(laughter).

381
00:26:51,125 --> 00:26:52,125
All right.

382
00:26:52,125 --> 00:26:54,999
To our first time speaker and our first time attendee.

383
00:26:55,667 --> 00:26:56,999
(applause).

384
00:27:00,999 --> 00:27:03,999
RUNA SANDVIK: I have a lot of time for questions.

385
00:27:08,083 --> 00:27:11,083
I sort of wish I had started with that.

386
00:27:11,083 --> 00:27:12,709
(laughter).

387
00:27:12,751 --> 00:27:16,999
You can run a fast relay and help increase network diversity

388
00:27:16,999 --> 00:27:20,501
or you can run an exit scanner or help us improve

389
00:27:20,501 --> 00:27:23,709
the ones that we already have.

390
00:27:23,876 --> 00:27:25,999
And help us find misbehaving relays.

391
00:27:27,375 --> 00:27:30,792
So at this point, being the first time speaker at DEF CON

392
00:27:30,792 --> 00:27:36,292
and talking a lot faster than I usually do, I have a lot of time for questions.

393
00:27:36,792 --> 00:27:37,626
So if you have questions, you can line

394
00:27:37,626 --> 00:27:39,834
up with the microphone up front.

395
00:27:39,834 --> 00:27:47,167
(Off microphone) The people on the network are doing illegal things.

396
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:51,083
(applause)    RUNA SANDVIK: I got half of that.

397
00:27:51,083 --> 00:27:52,334
Do you want to repeat it.

398
00:27:52,334 --> 00:27:58,083
Is it legal to run an exit (inaudible) if the people exiting

399
00:27:58,083 --> 00:28:03,792
the network are doing illegal things?

400
00:28:03,792 --> 00:28:04,959
RUNA SANDVIK: Okay.

401
00:28:04,959 --> 00:28:08,667
Is it safe legally to run an exit relay if the people using your exit relay are

402
00:28:08,667 --> 00:28:10,999
doing illegal things?

403
00:28:13,083 --> 00:28:21,083
Running an exit relay is in some cases check be a bit risky.

404
00:28:21,292 --> 00:28:25,959
So it means that any Tor user, 600,000 users, a lot of them

405
00:28:25,959 --> 00:28:31,667
will be using your server to access the public Internet.

406
00:28:31,667 --> 00:28:34,250
It means anything they do online will be seen as coming

407
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:37,999
from your computer, from your IP address.

408
00:28:38,375 --> 00:28:41,999
Over the past year there has been stories about people

409
00:28:41,999 --> 00:28:46,334
in Germany having their doors knocked down and their computers taken

410
00:28:46,334 --> 00:28:50,584
or a series of DNC take down notices and similar.

411
00:28:50,751 --> 00:28:55,501
We have spent a lot of time trying to educate law enforcement,

412
00:28:55,501 --> 00:28:59,250
teach them what Tor is, how it works, when or how

413
00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:04,167
they would encounter Tor when investigating people.

414
00:29:05,542 --> 00:29:07,959
That's worked out pretty well.

415
00:29:07,959 --> 00:29:11,334
We have sort of helped them understand that when

416
00:29:11,334 --> 00:29:15,584
they do hit an exit relay, it is Tor.

417
00:29:15,584 --> 00:29:17,751
It doesn't actually log any information.

418
00:29:17,751 --> 00:29:20,999
There is no information to be found there about the Tor users.

419
00:29:21,501 --> 00:29:25,834
But at the same time, if you feel that that is a risk,

420
00:29:25,834 --> 00:29:30,999
then running a nonexit is probably the safer option.

421
00:29:30,999 --> 00:29:34,999
So we have a blog post called tips for running an exit relay

422
00:29:34,999 --> 00:29:40,292
with minimum amount of harassment, which sort of lines out a series

423
00:29:40,292 --> 00:29:46,834
of steps and things to consider if you want to set up an exit relay.

424
00:29:46,834 --> 00:29:50,459
Sort of running on a dedicated server, don't have your personal photos

425
00:29:50,459 --> 00:29:52,918
and GPG and whatever else, chat logs

426
00:29:52,918 --> 00:29:57,501
on the same server that you're running a Tor exit relay.

427
00:29:57,876 --> 00:30:01,459
Do not encrypt that drive in the server that is running

428
00:30:01,459 --> 00:30:04,250
the Tor exit relay felt.

429
00:30:04,501 --> 00:30:08,584
If you have a server with a nonencrypted disk and Tor

430
00:30:08,584 --> 00:30:14,417
is not logging anything, there will be no information on that server

431
00:30:14,417 --> 00:30:18,459
for law enforcement to dig through.

432
00:30:18,959 --> 00:30:21,709
So I would say if you're considering setting

433
00:30:21,709 --> 00:30:24,709
up an exit relay; that would probably be

434
00:30:24,709 --> 00:30:29,000
the first page I would send you to read up on.

435
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,999
Whether or not it's safe legally, I'm not a lawyer,

436
00:30:30,999 --> 00:30:33,959
so I can't really answer that question.

437
00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:39,876
(Off microphone)    RUNA SANDVIK: Sorry?

438
00:30:39,876 --> 00:30:44,584
(Off microphone)    RUNA SANDVIK: It's a service that allows you to enter

439
00:30:44,584 --> 00:30:47,999
an IP address and see if server X was running

440
00:30:47,999 --> 00:30:50,375
as a Tor exit relay at time Y.

441
00:30:50,375 --> 00:30:55,375
So in the case that you to run into issues with law enforcement,

442
00:30:55,375 --> 00:31:00,667
you can use that service to sort of point them to our page and sort

443
00:31:00,667 --> 00:31:04,459
of explain to them that you were actually running

444
00:31:04,459 --> 00:31:06,542
an exit relay.

445
00:31:06,542 --> 00:31:09,751
If you do run an exit relay and you run into problems,

446
00:31:09,751 --> 00:31:12,375
you can also e mail us and we will send

447
00:31:12,375 --> 00:31:17,083
a signed letter confirming that, yes, you were running an exit relay

448
00:31:17,083 --> 00:31:19,626
at that point in time.

449
00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:32,501
So there's hidden entrance nodes via bridges.

450
00:31:32,501 --> 00:31:37,167
Are there any to look into having exit nodes in a similar way?

451
00:31:37,167 --> 00:31:39,709
RUNA SANDVIK: Having hidden exit nodes?

452
00:31:39,709 --> 00:31:40,792
Yes.

453
00:31:40,792 --> 00:31:44,999
RUNA SANDVIK: So the question is about bridges.

454
00:31:46,876 --> 00:31:50,626
The image that I showed of how Tor works, mentioned

455
00:31:50,626 --> 00:31:54,792
the guard relay, we also have something called bridges,

456
00:31:54,792 --> 00:31:59,125
which is similar to the guards, just that they're not listed

457
00:31:59,125 --> 00:32:01,375
on the Internet.

458
00:32:01,375 --> 00:32:02,584
You can't find a list of every single Bridge,

459
00:32:02,584 --> 00:32:05,292
which means that if you're in China and you need to connect

460
00:32:05,292 --> 00:32:09,167
to Tor and Tor is being blocked, you can use a Bridge instead.

461
00:32:12,083 --> 00:32:15,250
I don't think I'm not sure if we have even considered hiding

462
00:32:15,250 --> 00:32:17,083
the exit nodes.

463
00:32:17,083 --> 00:32:18,709
I'm not sure if that would actually be

464
00:32:18,709 --> 00:32:20,709
a good defense.

465
00:32:20,709 --> 00:32:24,459
It sort of seems to me like it would be just a bit

466
00:32:24,459 --> 00:32:26,999
of an arms race.

467
00:32:27,375 --> 00:32:29,292
We would hide them someone would find them,

468
00:32:29,292 --> 00:32:32,083
and it would continue from there.

469
00:32:36,999 --> 00:32:41,083
What about running relays in the Cloud and like, for instance,

470
00:32:41,083 --> 00:32:44,083
if there are just a whole bunch of Cloud based

471
00:32:44,083 --> 00:32:47,083
like Amazon AWS based relays, what does that do

472
00:32:47,083 --> 00:32:49,999
with your network diversity?

473
00:32:49,999 --> 00:32:52,667
RUNA SANDVIK: Okay.

474
00:32:52,709 --> 00:33:01,999
Relays so with Amazon specifically, you are allowed had to run a Bridge.

475
00:33:02,083 --> 00:33:05,999
Running a relay is also allowed as terms of service, but you

476
00:33:05,999 --> 00:33:09,876
will be paying too much money for bandwidth.

477
00:33:10,459 --> 00:33:13,999
So you just don't want to do that.

478
00:33:13,999 --> 00:33:17,999
An exit relay is not allowed in the terms of service.

479
00:33:17,999 --> 00:33:21,999
If someone wanted to set up thousands of relays to join

480
00:33:21,999 --> 00:33:25,542
the network, I'm not sure it would help

481
00:33:25,542 --> 00:33:28,626
the diversity too much.

482
00:33:28,626 --> 00:33:32,542
Tor will only pick fast relays to use for its circuits.

483
00:33:32,542 --> 00:33:35,959
So if you have, like, a thousand sort of slow relays joining the network,

484
00:33:35,959 --> 00:33:40,083
then we would have a thousand slow users on the network.

485
00:33:40,751 --> 00:33:44,083
My question is pretty specific

486
00:33:44,083 --> 00:33:50,584
regarding are you aware of whether or not Google fibers' terms

487
00:33:50,584 --> 00:33:57,751
of service restricts you from running an exit relay or not?

488
00:34:01,250 --> 00:34:04,999
RUNA SANDVIK: I don't know.

489
00:34:06,292 --> 00:34:09,918
If anyone from Google is here that can answer that question,

490
00:34:09,918 --> 00:34:12,375
then we would like to know.

491
00:34:12,375 --> 00:34:13,999
No servers on Google fiber.

492
00:34:13,999 --> 00:34:18,209
RUNA SANDVIK: No servers at all?

493
00:34:19,209 --> 00:34:20,999
(Off microphone)    RUNA SANDVIK: If anyone from Google is here,

494
00:34:20,999 --> 00:34:22,918
then I'd like to talk to you.

495
00:34:22,918 --> 00:34:23,918
(laughter).

496
00:34:23,918 --> 00:34:25,459
No computers on Google fiber.

497
00:34:25,459 --> 00:34:26,459
(laughter).

498
00:34:28,999 --> 00:34:30,375
(applause).

499
00:34:36,375 --> 00:34:39,125
RUNA SANDVIK: Any questions at this point?

500
00:34:39,125 --> 00:34:47,751
(Off microphone)    RUNA SANDVIK: I didn't hear

501
00:34:47,751 --> 00:35:01,999
the full (Off microphone)    RUNA SANDVIK: If there are more malicious

502
00:35:01,999 --> 00:35:06,083
relays than non?

503
00:35:06,167 --> 00:35:09,083
More malicious users.

504
00:35:09,125 --> 00:35:12,999
(Off microphone)    RUNA SANDVIK: Okay.

505
00:35:12,999 --> 00:35:15,999
If there are more bad users than good users?

506
00:35:16,417 --> 00:35:17,417
Okay.

507
00:35:18,667 --> 00:35:20,417
We don't know.

508
00:35:20,792 --> 00:35:24,083
So you go to our website and you download Tor, and

509
00:35:24,083 --> 00:35:27,167
the only thing that pops up in our Apache log

510
00:35:27,167 --> 00:35:30,083
is that someone visited Tor.

511
00:35:30,584 --> 00:35:32,250
We don't log your IP address.

512
00:35:32,250 --> 00:35:34,999
We know people are downloading Tor, but that is it.

513
00:35:34,999 --> 00:35:36,209
We have no information.

514
00:35:36,209 --> 00:35:38,250
We don't know what you're using Tor for.

515
00:35:38,334 --> 00:35:40,459
Back in the day someone did a study to see

516
00:35:40,459 --> 00:35:43,667
at least which protocols were used.

517
00:35:43,751 --> 00:35:45,459
It was mostly web traffic.

518
00:35:45,876 --> 00:35:48,125
But apart from that, we have no we have no way

519
00:35:48,125 --> 00:35:51,918
of telling what people are doing over Tor.

520
00:35:52,167 --> 00:35:56,999
(Off microphone)    RUNA SANDVIK: We were accidently banned

521
00:35:56,999 --> 00:35:59,375
by Facebook, yes.

522
00:35:59,999 --> 00:36:02,999
The issue that was a month ago.

523
00:36:03,209 --> 00:36:04,209
Okay.

524
00:36:04,209 --> 00:36:05,417
So it does happen.

525
00:36:05,417 --> 00:36:08,125
So someone used Tor to sort of try and scrape content

526
00:36:08,125 --> 00:36:12,125
from publicly available content from Facebook and Facebook sort

527
00:36:12,125 --> 00:36:16,083
of accidently blocked a ton of Tor exit relays.

528
00:36:16,083 --> 00:36:17,125
So it does happen.

529
00:36:17,209 --> 00:36:19,709
But we have no way of telling how often it happens

530
00:36:19,709 --> 00:36:23,709
or how many users are actually misbehaving that way.

531
00:36:23,918 --> 00:36:28,999
Can you speak to hidden services.

532
00:36:29,167 --> 00:36:33,417
RUNA SANDVIK: What about hidden services?

533
00:36:33,417 --> 00:36:35,918
Could you briefly detail what they are?

534
00:36:35,918 --> 00:36:40,999
RUNA SANDVIK: Tor Hidden Services, dubbed by the media

535
00:36:40,999 --> 00:36:46,250
as Darth Web, is a way of hosting content anonymously

536
00:36:46,250 --> 00:36:48,125
over Tor.

537
00:36:48,125 --> 00:36:52,999
So it means that you can set up a website and it will have a URL

538
00:36:52,999 --> 00:36:57,792
of 16 characters and dot onion at the end.

539
00:36:57,999 --> 00:36:59,918
It will only be accessible on Tor and no one

540
00:36:59,918 --> 00:37:03,876
will know you are hosting the sites and no one will know who is visiting

541
00:37:03,876 --> 00:37:06,999
the sites because everything is over Tor.

542
00:37:07,876 --> 00:37:10,792
The content cannot be censored.

543
00:37:10,792 --> 00:37:14,125
We cannot find out who is running Tor Hidden Services.

544
00:37:14,999 --> 00:37:19,167
So it's sort of anonymous hosting in a way.

545
00:37:19,501 --> 00:37:21,918
Recently there was a paper published pointing

546
00:37:21,918 --> 00:37:25,918
out a number of issues with Tor Hidden Services.

547
00:37:25,918 --> 00:37:27,167
We wrote a very long blog post explaining

548
00:37:27,167 --> 00:37:29,626
all the things we would like to see improved

549
00:37:29,626 --> 00:37:31,999
with Tor Hidden Services.

550
00:37:37,083 --> 00:37:39,542
How do you establish trust in the consensus?

551
00:37:39,542 --> 00:37:41,209
RUNA SANDVIK: When you set up the question was how do you

552
00:37:41,209 --> 00:37:43,999
establish trust for the consensus?

553
00:37:43,999 --> 00:37:50,083
How do you make sure that the list clients download is a safe list?

554
00:37:50,167 --> 00:37:56,834
When you set up a relay, your relay will tell nine directory authorities that

555
00:37:56,834 --> 00:37:58,667
it exists.

556
00:37:58,792 --> 00:38:03,209
These nine directory authorities will then confirm that your relay has

557
00:38:03,209 --> 00:38:08,626
the IP address that you've said that it has, the nickname matches, if it's

558
00:38:08,626 --> 00:38:11,999
an exit it will make sure that you can actually

559
00:38:11,999 --> 00:38:17,584
exit, and then these nine directory authorities will vote on this information,

560
00:38:17,584 --> 00:38:21,709
whether or not that information is correct.

561
00:38:21,709 --> 00:38:26,584
If the majority of them vote that, yeah, it's correct, is valid,

562
00:38:26,584 --> 00:38:31,209
then that relay makes it into the consensus.

563
00:38:31,501 --> 00:38:33,999
Once they have done that for all the relays in the network,

564
00:38:33,999 --> 00:38:37,999
that list is then signed by every single directory authority.

565
00:38:37,999 --> 00:38:39,999
When the client downloads this list, they will check that

566
00:38:39,999 --> 00:38:41,999
the signatures are okay.

567
00:38:43,584 --> 00:38:46,501
I had a follow up question to that.

568
00:38:46,876 --> 00:38:49,083
Who controls the directory authorities

569
00:38:49,083 --> 00:38:52,584
and who controls the onion domain name services

570
00:38:52,584 --> 00:38:54,334
or servers?

571
00:38:54,334 --> 00:38:55,999
RUNA SANDVIK: Okay.

572
00:38:55,999 --> 00:39:02,292
The directory authorities are run by core Tor Project developers

573
00:39:02,292 --> 00:39:05,959
or people that we trust.

574
00:39:06,083 --> 00:39:08,334
So there's a good mix of some of them are in the U.S., some

575
00:39:08,334 --> 00:39:10,834
of them are outside of the U.S.

576
00:39:10,834 --> 00:39:12,999
Some are run by Tor people and some are not.

577
00:39:13,083 --> 00:39:17,334
But you have to be a trusted member of the community to be able to run one.

578
00:39:17,999 --> 00:39:21,999
The second question was about the .onion domains.

579
00:39:23,959 --> 00:39:26,083
No one really controls that.

580
00:39:26,501 --> 00:39:27,792
You generate a domain when you set

581
00:39:27,792 --> 00:39:29,999
up a Tor hidden service.

582
00:39:29,999 --> 00:39:32,083
(Off microphone)    RUNA SANDVIK: Japan?

583
00:39:32,083 --> 00:39:38,167
(Off microphone)    RUNA SANDVIK: Is there diversity

584
00:39:38,167 --> 00:39:46,751
in the directory authorities to protect from corridors

585
00:39:46,751 --> 00:39:51,250
from a certain country?

586
00:40:11,042 --> 00:40:15,417
(Off microphone)    RUNA SANDVIK: If the NSA server and directed

587
00:40:15,417 --> 00:40:20,125
all Tor traffic to the NSA, then we just wouldn't do it.

588
00:40:31,250 --> 00:40:32,667
(applause).

589
00:40:43,792 --> 00:40:49,876
(Off microphone)    RUNA SANDVIK: Is there any way for an exit relay

590
00:40:49,876 --> 00:40:53,918
to figure out who the Tor user is?

591
00:40:54,209 --> 00:40:55,209
No.

592
00:40:55,667 --> 00:40:57,918
So the only information that the exit relay has

593
00:40:57,918 --> 00:41:01,417
is that people are doing stuff, people are watching, you know,

594
00:41:01,417 --> 00:41:03,250
videos of cats.

595
00:41:03,999 --> 00:41:05,167
(laughter).

596
00:41:05,167 --> 00:41:08,626
The only thing that you can do, if you were to attack Tor users,

597
00:41:08,626 --> 00:41:12,626
would be to make sure that you are that first hop, that you are

598
00:41:12,626 --> 00:41:16,709
the guard relay and that you are the exit relay.

599
00:41:16,999 --> 00:41:20,709
And doing that when targeting a person seems really, really difficult.

600
00:41:20,709 --> 00:41:23,999
I'm sure you have at least the NSA, probably has way better options

601
00:41:23,999 --> 00:41:29,083
to actually target people than to try and spin a thousand Tor relays.

602
00:41:33,626 --> 00:41:41,709
(Off microphone)    RUNA SANDVIK: So Tor is TCP only right now.

603
00:41:42,083 --> 00:41:47,751
We have a proposal for UDP, but I'm not sure what the status is.

604
00:41:47,751 --> 00:41:50,459
I don't think we've done a lost work on that for a while.

605
00:41:50,459 --> 00:41:53,918
We have done more work on getting Tor to IPv6 to play nice.

606
00:41:53,918 --> 00:42:01,501
(Off microphone)    RUNA SANDVIK: Hardware?

607
00:42:01,751 --> 00:42:04,834
(Off microphone)    RUNA SANDVIK: Could you repeat that?

608
00:42:04,834 --> 00:42:06,417
Hardware integration.

609
00:42:06,417 --> 00:42:08,792
RUNA SANDVIK: Hardware integration?

610
00:42:08,792 --> 00:42:09,792
Okay.

611
00:42:09,792 --> 00:42:10,792
Thanks.

612
00:42:10,999 --> 00:42:14,918
So we have a project called the Tor router, which the goal is just

613
00:42:14,918 --> 00:42:19,167
to take a stock router and put Tor on it and make sure that it sets

614
00:42:19,167 --> 00:42:24,083
up a wireless network where everything that you do on that wireless network

615
00:42:24,083 --> 00:42:28,751
is sent through Tor and that it is also running as a Bridge or a relay

616
00:42:28,751 --> 00:42:31,667
or an exit relay, for example.

617
00:42:31,999 --> 00:42:33,626
That project will probably be announced

618
00:42:33,626 --> 00:42:35,751
in about six months.

619
00:42:35,751 --> 00:42:39,501
There are other projects, like the onion pie?

620
00:42:39,999 --> 00:42:42,999
I know freedom box has sort of worked on some stuff.

621
00:42:43,501 --> 00:42:45,876
There's a lot of work being done.

622
00:42:45,999 --> 00:42:49,083
We need more people to sort of help us test those projects,

623
00:42:49,083 --> 00:42:52,292
but we don't have anything right now.

624
00:42:59,751 --> 00:43:02,999
What's your opinion on an exit node filtering traffic?

625
00:43:02,999 --> 00:43:03,999
RUNA SANDVIK: If you're running an exit node to filter traffic,

626
00:43:03,999 --> 00:43:06,083
then don't run an exit node at all.

627
00:43:06,083 --> 00:43:07,834
Like child pornography?

628
00:43:07,834 --> 00:43:10,999
RUNA SANDVIK: Sure, if you want to talk

629
00:43:10,999 --> 00:43:15,250
about child pornography specifically.

630
00:43:16,125 --> 00:43:20,417
Running an exit relay in general means who are you

631
00:43:20,417 --> 00:43:25,709
to decide what people can and cannot watch online?

632
00:43:26,999 --> 00:43:28,250
Right?

633
00:43:29,626 --> 00:43:31,876
It's you okay.

634
00:43:31,876 --> 00:43:35,876
So you obviously, I think we'll agree, child porn is bad.

635
00:43:35,918 --> 00:43:40,209
What if we gave people the ability to actually decide what Tor users can

636
00:43:40,209 --> 00:43:44,083
and cannot visit through their exit nodes.

637
00:43:44,542 --> 00:43:48,375
Watching videos of cats is bad, so suddenly I'm censoring a number

638
00:43:48,375 --> 00:43:53,209
of Tor users who want to look at totally legitimate things.

639
00:43:53,834 --> 00:43:57,250
So we just decided that we shouldn't decide what users can

640
00:43:57,250 --> 00:43:59,459
and cannot watch.

641
00:43:59,459 --> 00:44:06,999
It also means that we cannot be asked or forced by anyone to censor anything.

642
00:44:06,999 --> 00:44:08,459
We don't control the network.

643
00:44:08,459 --> 00:44:09,459
Users do.

644
00:44:09,459 --> 00:44:10,459
(applause).

645
00:44:10,459 --> 00:44:11,459
Anything else?

646
00:44:11,459 --> 00:44:11,459
On the last point, is there a problem right now with deficiency

647
00:44:11,459 --> 00:44:12,959
in the number of exit nodes?

648
00:44:12,959 --> 00:44:28,999
I can run an exit node by filtering certain sites, like illegal.

649
00:44:28,999 --> 00:44:33,083
(Off microphone) do you think it's worth running an exit node?

650
00:44:33,083 --> 00:44:36,959
Are you guys desperate for exit nodes?

651
00:44:40,417 --> 00:44:56,792
RUNA SANDVIK: We are desperate for exit nodes.

652
00:44:56,792 --> 00:45:00,792
But we would prefer exit nodes that are not touching user traffic regardless

653
00:45:00,792 --> 00:45:02,626
of what it is.

654
00:45:07,501 --> 00:45:11,999
(Off microphone)    RUNA SANDVIK: There are absolutely no logs.

655
00:45:15,125 --> 00:45:17,250
(Off microphone)    RUNA SANDVIK: Nine.

656
00:45:17,250 --> 00:45:20,501
The question was if we have any logs at all.

657
00:45:20,584 --> 00:45:22,918
And the answer is no, we don't have anything.

658
00:45:22,918 --> 00:45:24,250
When you visit our website, you download Tor,

659
00:45:24,250 --> 00:45:27,334
we write just zeroes in the log or we write all zeroes

660
00:45:27,334 --> 00:45:29,999
if you're visiting the HDTP.

661
00:45:34,542 --> 00:45:38,501
We don't know you start up Tor and the only there's sort

662
00:45:38,501 --> 00:45:42,999
of two entities that will know you're using Tor.

663
00:45:42,999 --> 00:45:45,209
Your ISP and the guard relay.

664
00:45:45,209 --> 00:45:46,959
They will know you're using Tor.

665
00:45:46,959 --> 00:45:48,999
They won't know what you're using Tor for.

666
00:45:48,999 --> 00:45:51,083
And the exit relay, one will know someone is using Tor

667
00:45:51,083 --> 00:45:54,375
to do something, but they won't know who.

668
00:45:54,375 --> 00:45:55,876
There are no logs.

669
00:45:55,876 --> 00:45:57,459
Nothing to be subpoenaed.

670
00:45:57,459 --> 00:46:00,999
We cannot be given any magical letters to force us to do anything.

671
00:46:01,083 --> 00:46:02,999
We don't have any info about our users.

672
00:46:02,999 --> 00:46:09,792
(Off microphone)    RUNA SANDVIK: That's a good point.

673
00:46:09,792 --> 00:46:15,876
The ISP, yeah, the ISP, whoever the backbone provider is, that's

674
00:46:15,876 --> 00:46:18,626
a good question.

675
00:46:18,751 --> 00:46:21,459
The question is if they actually look at that traffic.

676
00:46:22,375 --> 00:46:28,834
Is that like a common thing for ISP's or service providers on a top level?

677
00:46:30,375 --> 00:46:33,999
Does the backbone provider log incoming

678
00:46:33,999 --> 00:46:39,709
connections to websites that are hosted by people?

679
00:46:43,999 --> 00:46:51,417
(Off microphone)    RUNA SANDVIK: If we want if we're going

680
00:46:51,417 --> 00:47:00,083
to put together a list of Tor projects, is that the question?

681
00:47:00,167 --> 00:47:04,959
(Off microphone)    RUNA SANDVIK: Tor apps?

682
00:47:04,959 --> 00:47:07,417
So we have a list on our website talking

683
00:47:07,417 --> 00:47:10,999
about products and services that we had.

684
00:47:11,667 --> 00:47:15,999
If you're not in that list, then it is not a project that is maintained

685
00:47:15,999 --> 00:47:18,999
or developed by the Tor Project.

686
00:47:18,999 --> 00:47:24,083
Have you ever seen exit nodes attacking to browsers?

687
00:47:24,083 --> 00:47:26,459
RUNA SANDVIK: No.

688
00:47:26,459 --> 00:47:29,167
I have not seen any Tor exit nodes attacking browsers.

689
00:47:29,167 --> 00:47:33,250
So for users running, like, the door browser bundle,

690
00:47:33,250 --> 00:47:37,999
what safeguards are in place to prevent the exit relay

691
00:47:37,999 --> 00:47:42,083
from serving up, like, a malicious Twitter.com

692
00:47:42,083 --> 00:47:46,209
and sending some sort of malicious program back

693
00:47:46,209 --> 00:47:50,292
to their computer to kind of make a connection

694
00:47:50,292 --> 00:47:52,834
on the open Web?

695
00:47:52,834 --> 00:47:56,999
RUNA SANDVIK: So if there are any restrictions

696
00:47:56,999 --> 00:48:02,626
on    Like what kind of protections are there?

697
00:48:02,626 --> 00:48:05,959
RUNA SANDVIK: The Tor blocks a lot of things like Flash and Java

698
00:48:05,959 --> 00:48:09,459
and some JavaScript and things like that.

699
00:48:10,667 --> 00:48:16,083
But like I said, if an exit relay is able to inject a very specific type

700
00:48:16,083 --> 00:48:20,584
of exploit into the users traffic, then there are no, like,

701
00:48:20,584 --> 00:48:25,375
if you can do that without getting a user to open an attachment,

702
00:48:25,375 --> 00:48:27,083
then yeah.

703
00:48:35,209 --> 00:48:38,334
(Off microphone)    RUNA SANDVIK: Okay.

704
00:48:39,292 --> 00:48:43,999
So he's waving at me saying we're out of time.

705
00:48:43,999 --> 00:48:47,751
We could meet in the chillout room and kind of continue there.

706
00:48:47,751 --> 00:48:48,751
Thanks.
