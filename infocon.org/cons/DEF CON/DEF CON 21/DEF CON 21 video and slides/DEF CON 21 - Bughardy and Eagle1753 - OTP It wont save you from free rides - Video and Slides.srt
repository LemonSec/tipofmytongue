1
00:00:00,167 --> 00:00:02,501
How's everyone doing today?

2
00:00:03,375 --> 00:00:04,501
Good.

3
00:00:04,501 --> 00:00:08,834
So now, let's come to our talk.

4
00:00:08,834 --> 00:00:13,959
And so MIFARE ULTRALIGHT system and ULTRALIGHT chips are used

5
00:00:13,959 --> 00:00:16,626
for communication.

6
00:00:17,584 --> 00:00:22,209
And in our country, they have been used especially

7
00:00:22,209 --> 00:00:27,209
for the transportation system like busses, Metro, and

8
00:00:27,209 --> 00:00:33,999
in the past there has been people who discovered some hacked the system

9
00:00:33,999 --> 00:00:38,918
of the communication between those chips.

10
00:00:38,918 --> 00:00:44,000
And so in 2008 the MIFARE classic which is a type

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,999
of chip classic in 2011 two American made

12
00:00:48,999 --> 00:00:54,083
to exploit and to see ULTRALIGHT one which

13
00:00:54,083 --> 00:00:59,584
is the one I will be speaking about.

14
00:01:01,125 --> 00:01:04,125
In my country, so in Italy, it has been used

15
00:01:04,125 --> 00:01:06,999
for transportation systems.

16
00:01:06,999 --> 00:01:09,918
So, if you take a bus, you will take a ticket,

17
00:01:09,918 --> 00:01:14,417
multiple ride ticket which has MIFARE inside.

18
00:01:17,083 --> 00:01:21,417
So what is it?

19
00:01:23,999 --> 00:01:28,959
RFID chips are designed to work at target frequency 1356 megahertz

20
00:01:28,959 --> 00:01:33,584
frequency and a lot of times as I told you before.

21
00:01:33,584 --> 00:01:37,209
There is a MIFARE classic ULTRALIGHT a lot of types.

22
00:01:37,334 --> 00:01:39,167
And the ULTRALIGHT is cheap.

23
00:01:39,375 --> 00:01:40,999
But it has a problem.

24
00:01:40,999 --> 00:01:43,999
It is not it has no hardware encryption.

25
00:01:44,501 --> 00:01:49,959
So how we came to this hack?

26
00:01:50,292 --> 00:01:55,959
Well, we started studying NFC chips when from January

27
00:01:55,959 --> 00:02:02,999
the local transportation system in Turin updated their stamping

28
00:02:02,999 --> 00:02:10,834
machines and so it was possible to use those tickets to ride the bus

29
00:02:10,834 --> 00:02:14,209
or Metro or what else.

30
00:02:14,209 --> 00:02:24,209
And it had the same vulnerability I was telling you about before.

31
00:02:24,834 --> 00:02:27,417
But the point is we didn't know anything

32
00:02:27,417 --> 00:02:31,125
about the structure of this ticket.

33
00:02:31,125 --> 00:02:33,999
So we tried with that vulnerability but we failed.

34
00:02:34,125 --> 00:02:36,209
That was the point, we failed.

35
00:02:36,667 --> 00:02:41,959
We tried to and so you know, if you don't know what are you dealing

36
00:02:41,959 --> 00:02:46,959
with, it is, let's say it's tricky to solve it.

37
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:51,209
So we decided to study better the kind of technology

38
00:02:51,209 --> 00:02:57,999
in case we discovered that we tried to make some little experiments

39
00:02:57,999 --> 00:03:03,459
and so we decided to stamp one ticket after the other

40
00:03:03,459 --> 00:03:09,459
and comparing the results we have an NFC reader and we read

41
00:03:09,459 --> 00:03:13,125
the dumps of those tickets.

42
00:03:13,125 --> 00:03:18,417
And we were comparing them to find if there were some similarities

43
00:03:18,417 --> 00:03:23,501
something similar to compare it and to find for example how does

44
00:03:23,501 --> 00:03:26,876
the data saved on the ticket.

45
00:03:27,083 --> 00:03:31,999
So we managed to get in empiric results of this.

46
00:03:38,125 --> 00:03:42,999
So assume that you know we're exactly the last time of the stamp

47
00:03:42,999 --> 00:03:46,125
of your ticket is being stored.

48
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:50,667
If you have an NFC form with an NFC reader and writer,

49
00:03:50,667 --> 00:03:54,999
you can actually change the field where the time

50
00:03:54,999 --> 00:03:58,792
of your last stamp is stored.

51
00:03:58,792 --> 00:04:01,999
And so that in this way, you can easily bypass the system

52
00:04:01,999 --> 00:04:07,959
of stamping, the stamping machine, you can stamp by yourself your ticket.

53
00:04:07,999 --> 00:04:15,209
And this is where we wanted to wanted to get.

54
00:04:15,542 --> 00:04:17,999
The point we were looking for.

55
00:04:18,292 --> 00:04:22,167
The problem is it is not so reliable the kind of thing, you have a reader

56
00:04:22,167 --> 00:04:24,709
and things to deal with.

57
00:04:27,584 --> 00:04:30,959
It is not the point.

58
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:34,167
If you want to add something about that the point

59
00:04:34,167 --> 00:04:37,459
is that we managed to solve our problem

60
00:04:37,459 --> 00:04:42,584
because when we looked more in we pay more attention about how

61
00:04:42,584 --> 00:04:45,125
the ticket was made.

62
00:04:47,375 --> 00:04:52,292
We came to a solution and we found that

63
00:04:52,292 --> 00:05:00,876
the answer to hack the ticket and find a way to make it limited was

64
00:05:00,876 --> 00:05:03,999
in the log bites.

65
00:05:03,999 --> 00:05:09,501
Log bytes are a sector of the ticket and he will speak about that now.

66
00:05:10,999 --> 00:05:15,125
This is the ticket of my city.

67
00:05:15,334 --> 00:05:21,834
The 5 rides ticket so you can stamp it until five times and then it expires.

68
00:05:24,083 --> 00:05:30,501
We will look at the log bytes and OTP is the only security function

69
00:05:30,501 --> 00:05:33,999
in the ULTRALIGHT tickets.

70
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:38,751
There are four bytes and by that four they are all set to zero.

71
00:05:38,999 --> 00:05:42,918
When you stamp the ticket, there is an operation that

72
00:05:42,918 --> 00:05:45,542
to turn one bit to one.

73
00:05:45,709 --> 00:05:48,083
So you can turn it back to zero.

74
00:05:48,667 --> 00:05:54,209
That's the only way you can stamp the ticket without any fraud.

75
00:05:54,292 --> 00:06:02,501
There are a number of possible rights on each ticket

76
00:06:02,501 --> 00:06:07,999
and we'll speak about later.

77
00:06:07,999 --> 00:06:09,334
The data sector.

78
00:06:23,751 --> 00:06:26,334
(Applause.)    I saw one of your slides coming in,

79
00:06:26,334 --> 00:06:28,876
it's not going to be funny.

80
00:06:28,876 --> 00:06:32,584
(Laughter) We have decided to brand this spot the fed, this

81
00:06:32,584 --> 00:06:35,167
is now shot the n00b.

82
00:06:35,167 --> 00:06:36,167
Are you even 18?

83
00:06:36,167 --> 00:06:41,250
No, we're not.

84
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:43,167
He's of legal drinking age in Italy.

85
00:06:43,167 --> 00:06:52,250
And this stage is actually technically part

86
00:06:52,250 --> 00:07:09,125
of Italy audience, raise your hand if it's your first DEF CON.

87
00:07:09,125 --> 00:07:17,375
You, sir, get up here.

88
00:07:17,375 --> 00:07:19,375
On stage somehow.

89
00:07:20,999 --> 00:07:24,999
To all the new people at DEF CON.

90
00:07:33,834 --> 00:07:34,959
Cheers!

91
00:07:34,999 --> 00:07:36,083
Okay.

92
00:07:36,209 --> 00:07:46,999
Where was I?

93
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:49,626
Okay.

94
00:07:52,584 --> 00:07:54,083
They were strong.

95
00:07:57,542 --> 00:08:03,792
The data sector was used in the past attack, 2011 attack for rights.

96
00:08:03,792 --> 00:08:09,209
But the sector is readable, writable so you just swipe it

97
00:08:09,209 --> 00:08:12,501
and get a new ticket.

98
00:08:12,751 --> 00:08:18,626
But in they fixed it so in Turin it doesn't work any more.

99
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:24,999
So for about just code time time stamp from the machine and reproduce it

100
00:08:24,999 --> 00:08:28,918
without touching the OTP sector.

101
00:08:28,918 --> 00:08:33,209
So the rides remain the same but we can stamp it ourselves.

102
00:08:33,959 --> 00:08:39,999
We're not getting the point because of lack of NFC.

103
00:08:39,999 --> 00:08:41,125
We're poor.

104
00:08:41,501 --> 00:08:50,167
If you want stamps of our ticket, we'll give you at the Q&A session.

105
00:08:50,626 --> 00:08:52,334
No problem.

106
00:08:52,334 --> 00:08:57,999
These are some empirical results we can speak more later.

107
00:08:58,999 --> 00:09:00,334
Doesn't matter.

108
00:09:00,334 --> 00:09:04,375
Okay, lock ak sector, this is the most important part of our talk.

109
00:09:04,667 --> 00:09:07,876
This is the point we found solution.

110
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:09,626
There are two bytes.

111
00:09:09,626 --> 00:09:12,999
First is red and second is orange.

112
00:09:12,999 --> 00:09:15,542
Okay, each bit of bytes can lock

113
00:09:15,542 --> 00:09:19,584
a sector and make it read only.

114
00:09:21,334 --> 00:09:29,999
So what we did is just lock the bit or lock bit sector that made read only

115
00:09:29,999 --> 00:09:32,542
the OTP data.

116
00:09:32,918 --> 00:09:37,918
Machine tries to do it but read only and I cannot.

117
00:09:41,167 --> 00:09:44,999
When we first made our test on the road.

118
00:09:44,999 --> 00:09:48,083
We found a little problem because it's not good

119
00:09:48,083 --> 00:09:52,999
by that your 5 rides ticket and then have always 5 rides when

120
00:09:52,999 --> 00:09:54,999
they test it.

121
00:09:54,999 --> 00:09:57,626
You forgot to took one of the rides.

122
00:09:59,876 --> 00:10:01,083
And so it was    Not good.

123
00:10:01,083 --> 00:10:04,292
What are you going to say to the man who is going

124
00:10:04,292 --> 00:10:06,999
to check your ticket.

125
00:10:06,999 --> 00:10:12,167
Okay.

126
00:10:13,918 --> 00:10:15,459
How to fix it.

127
00:10:15,792 --> 00:10:19,501
The lock attack is quite easy to be fixed.

128
00:10:19,959 --> 00:10:26,083
Because you just need to check if the OTP bits is read only or not.

129
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:29,834
And if it's read only refuse to validate.

130
00:10:29,959 --> 00:10:34,918
But the name problem is the time attack    Yeah, the point

131
00:10:34,918 --> 00:10:40,999
is there are two vulnerabilities we found but we exploit just one

132
00:10:40,999 --> 00:10:44,292
because of lack of time and hardware

133
00:10:44,292 --> 00:10:47,501
as he explained before.

134
00:10:48,459 --> 00:10:52,375
The time for vulnerability is easy to exploit

135
00:10:52,375 --> 00:10:56,459
if we can actually decode the data.

136
00:10:56,876 --> 00:11:02,667
And what if if you know exactly how the data was encoded and where it

137
00:11:02,667 --> 00:11:08,167
is exactly located inside your ticket, it will be really easy

138
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:13,209
to exploit this because if you have NFC reader, writer,

139
00:11:13,209 --> 00:11:18,501
you can write the data etch ooh team you want.

140
00:11:18,501 --> 00:11:22,501
You can put your ticket on your NFC phone and just stamp

141
00:11:22,501 --> 00:11:29,083
the actual data so the actual time if it is 5:15 then the you put your ticket

142
00:11:29,083 --> 00:11:35,501
over your phone and then you can write 5:15 each time you want.

143
00:11:35,584 --> 00:11:39,999
So you can bypass the validating system so you can still

144
00:11:39,999 --> 00:11:45,999
have four rides left and you're just adjusting the time.

145
00:11:46,292 --> 00:11:51,417
And that will be really hard to be fixed.

146
00:11:51,417 --> 00:11:54,999
Because all the data written inside the ticket

147
00:11:54,999 --> 00:12:01,626
is not encrypted hardware speaking so, if you're able to decode this, it

148
00:12:01,626 --> 00:12:06,999
will be hard to fix it while the lack attack so the exploit

149
00:12:06,999 --> 00:12:11,209
he was thinking about will be easy to be fixed

150
00:12:11,209 --> 00:12:17,999
because if the stamp machine checks if the lock bit is on or off, and then

151
00:12:17,999 --> 00:12:22,999
with feedback way, that stamp machine can immediately

152
00:12:22,999 --> 00:12:27,083
know if your ticket is fake or not.

153
00:12:27,584 --> 00:12:32,083
So now we are going to study more about those kind

154
00:12:32,083 --> 00:12:37,999
of tickets and try to decode data and if you'd like to help us,

155
00:12:37,999 --> 00:12:41,083
we are open minded we will give you

156
00:12:41,083 --> 00:12:46,834
the dumps and any help will be developed very well.

157
00:12:46,999 --> 00:12:48,999
Is that is the point.

158
00:12:48,999 --> 00:12:53,876
So we also thought about a solution for the time attack

159
00:12:53,876 --> 00:13:00,209
but it should require fine upgrade that enabled software encryption

160
00:13:00,209 --> 00:13:07,709
on the ticket because if you encrypt the ticket, you can just time stamp your

161
00:13:07,709 --> 00:13:10,959
ticket with your phone.

162
00:13:12,876 --> 00:13:16,417
But we spoke of that with our transport company and

163
00:13:16,417 --> 00:13:20,626
they say yeah, yeah, and never did anything.

164
00:13:20,626 --> 00:13:26,834
We're still waiting that our vulnerability is fixed on the ground we don't really

165
00:13:26,834 --> 00:13:29,083
know about that.

166
00:13:31,918 --> 00:13:32,999
Okay.

167
00:13:32,999 --> 00:13:37,125
We are working about tool that should do it

168
00:13:37,125 --> 00:13:40,999
everything automatically.

169
00:13:41,375 --> 00:13:47,751
And actually, it is written in Python and works on Linux computer.

170
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:58,417
You need NFC, that is the tool we used for encoding

171
00:13:58,417 --> 00:14:02,999
and writing the tickets.

172
00:14:02,999 --> 00:14:05,999
It is a meter you can find anywhere cheap for $10

173
00:14:05,999 --> 00:14:11,792
on eBay or something like that and get free rides for your life.

174
00:14:14,542 --> 00:14:16,959
(Laughter) We started selling these.

175
00:14:27,542 --> 00:14:33,626
We're open for donation of the set but we have lack of money.

176
00:14:42,459 --> 00:14:45,959
So I think that's it.

177
00:14:46,083 --> 00:14:49,542
If you have questions about how we got into it

178
00:14:49,542 --> 00:14:53,459
but I think I don't know if you got the meaning

179
00:14:53,459 --> 00:14:56,999
of what we're speaking about.

180
00:14:57,167 --> 00:14:59,999
You know, it is a little difficult to speak

181
00:14:59,999 --> 00:15:05,167
in another language when you're outside and but we tried.

182
00:15:05,167 --> 00:15:09,417
And I think it has been a very good experience, I think,

183
00:15:09,417 --> 00:15:15,709
I hope you enjoyed this talk and I hope well, you got the clue for us,

184
00:15:15,709 --> 00:15:19,999
it was a very big not surprise but we were happy

185
00:15:19,999 --> 00:15:25,083
to fine something about this and to have been accepted here

186
00:15:25,083 --> 00:15:28,834
to explain you what we found.

187
00:15:29,209 --> 00:15:32,209
If you want to test the vulnerability on your city,

188
00:15:32,209 --> 00:15:35,999
we're glad to receive feedback and also invitation for lunch, dinner,

189
00:15:35,999 --> 00:15:38,083
coffee, everything.

190
00:15:38,083 --> 00:15:46,626
(Laughter) (Applause)    I think speaking

191
00:15:46,626 --> 00:15:58,459
about things wouldn't be so appreciated by you.

192
00:15:58,459 --> 00:16:03,292
I don't know if you will appreciate to speak about the very detail

193
00:16:03,292 --> 00:16:08,667
of if you want in the Q&A, you can ask for further information

194
00:16:08,667 --> 00:16:12,375
and details about those tickets.

195
00:16:12,709 --> 00:16:17,375
So you have any questions?

196
00:16:17,999 --> 00:16:19,250
Or?

197
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:24,334
AUDIENCE: How do you find out what technology your mass transit

198
00:16:24,334 --> 00:16:26,876
system was using.

199
00:16:26,876 --> 00:16:32,334
Yeah, the advertising on the Web site.

200
00:16:38,083 --> 00:16:41,999
(Laughter)    Google.

201
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:44,501
AUDIENCE: That's convenient.

202
00:16:44,501 --> 00:16:47,083
There's a similar system in use the Bay Area.

203
00:16:47,167 --> 00:16:49,999
I'm interested in what you were talking

204
00:16:49,999 --> 00:16:54,083
about with the time stamp because the San Francisco system,

205
00:16:54,083 --> 00:16:58,542
the way it works is you swipe to get on the bus the first time

206
00:16:58,542 --> 00:17:03,417
and you have 90 minutes to be able to    Like in Turin.

207
00:17:03,417 --> 00:17:05,918
AUDIENCE: So you have the same system there.

208
00:17:05,918 --> 00:17:06,542
So it just amounts to changing the time stamp

209
00:17:06,542 --> 00:17:10,167
on that and you change it to now and you get 90 minutes from now

210
00:17:10,167 --> 00:17:13,501
to be able to ride and you can do that.

211
00:17:13,501 --> 00:17:16,083
That's your free for life system.

212
00:17:16,083 --> 00:17:17,083
Is that correct?

213
00:17:17,083 --> 00:17:23,334
Yeah, there's the work in progress because just a second.

214
00:17:23,334 --> 00:17:24,334
Okay.

215
00:17:26,125 --> 00:17:29,751
If you're see, we are just guessing where

216
00:17:29,751 --> 00:17:36,209
the realtime stamp is stored because we didn't have an NFC phone.

217
00:17:36,209 --> 00:17:39,999
So going on the train with a computer five tickets and then

218
00:17:39,999 --> 00:17:42,999
an this, it's not so good.

219
00:17:42,999 --> 00:17:49,834
But --    There's nothing suspicious about that at all.

220
00:17:49,834 --> 00:17:50,999
It happens all the time.

221
00:17:51,125 --> 00:17:54,083
In San Francisco anyway, you see that stuff all the time.

222
00:17:54,083 --> 00:17:55,083
Okay.

223
00:17:55,083 --> 00:17:59,250
So, if you have invitation for San Francisco.

224
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:15,584
AUDIENCE: Love to have you.

225
00:18:16,999 --> 00:18:20,417
We sent a mail to the company explaining that we

226
00:18:20,417 --> 00:18:23,083
found this vulnerability.

227
00:18:23,083 --> 00:18:24,083
Yesterday.

228
00:18:24,083 --> 00:18:38,083
(Laughter) (Applause)    They are not geeks so they can't reply very fast.

229
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:40,999
So we're waiting now for a reply.

230
00:18:40,999 --> 00:18:41,999
No.

231
00:18:41,999 --> 00:18:45,209
We are publishing a white paper about that and we send it to them.

232
00:18:45,209 --> 00:18:46,999
But I hope they won't fix on this.

233
00:18:46,999 --> 00:18:48,876
Because I take some ground very often.

234
00:18:48,876 --> 00:18:51,751
If you want to read our white paper, it will be available.

235
00:18:51,751 --> 00:18:52,918
We will share with you.

236
00:18:52,918 --> 00:18:54,459
Very bad written but it works.

237
00:18:54,459 --> 00:18:55,459
Anyone else?

238
00:18:55,459 --> 00:18:56,459
No invitation?

239
00:18:56,459 --> 00:18:57,626
(Laughter) Thank you.

240
00:18:57,626 --> 00:18:58,792
Thank you very much.

241
00:18:58,792 --> 00:18:59,999
There is information.

242
00:18:59,999 --> 00:18:59,999
If you won't send us invitation after the talk

243
00:18:59,999 --> 00:19:01,501
because our talk I don't know.

244
00:19:01,501 --> 00:19:03,375
Twitter mine is @ bughardy This is his.

245
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:06,459
If you want to find us on Twitter, just thank you very much.

246
00:19:06,459 --> 00:19:08,959
If you have a question, just raise your hand.

247
00:19:08,959 --> 00:19:08,959
Don't come here so everyone can --    So I totally missed your talk,

248
00:19:08,959 --> 00:19:09,959
you ended earlier.

249
00:19:09,959 --> 00:19:12,375
We got another 20 minutes so we're going to do Q&A.

250
00:19:12,375 --> 00:19:12,375
I missed the talk so I don't have any questions but I hear it has to do

251
00:19:12,375 --> 00:19:13,459
with NFC technology.

252
00:19:13,459 --> 00:19:14,459
You?

253
00:19:14,459 --> 00:19:15,459
Maybe?

254
00:19:15,459 --> 00:19:16,459
It's okay.

255
00:19:16,459 --> 00:19:17,876
So what's your talk about?

256
00:19:17,876 --> 00:19:18,876
Again, okay.

257
00:19:18,876 --> 00:19:19,876
It was about NFC.

258
00:19:19,876 --> 00:19:20,999
Use the microphone.

259
00:19:20,999 --> 00:19:21,999
Sorry.

260
00:19:21,999 --> 00:19:23,125
We have another drink.

261
00:19:23,125 --> 00:19:24,125
Another drink.

262
00:19:24,125 --> 00:19:25,125
Yes!

263
00:19:25,125 --> 00:19:26,125
Yes.

264
00:19:26,125 --> 00:19:27,999
This is your first DEF CON, isn't it?

265
00:19:27,999 --> 00:19:28,999
Yes!

266
00:19:28,999 --> 00:19:28,999
So, if you do have any questions, you can feel to come in and get

267
00:19:28,999 --> 00:19:31,083
in line here because I didn't see the talk.

268
00:19:31,083 --> 00:19:32,083
Okay.

269
00:19:32,083 --> 00:19:34,584
So we are waiting for some questions if you have.

270
00:19:34,584 --> 00:19:36,375
We just run a little bit with our talk.

271
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:37,375
Okay.

272
00:19:37,375 --> 00:19:38,959
I can see we spent 32 minutes.

273
00:19:38,959 --> 00:19:40,999
Yahoo    So we've made this mistake before.

274
00:19:40,999 --> 00:19:42,209
We'd like to apologize.

275
00:19:42,209 --> 00:19:44,876
What the picture says is not what it represented.

276
00:19:44,876 --> 00:19:46,459
So yes, you actually have an hour.

277
00:19:46,459 --> 00:19:47,459
Bonus.

278
00:19:47,459 --> 00:19:47,459
So we're going on and let's say there

279
00:19:47,459 --> 00:19:48,459
is a question here.

280
00:19:48,459 --> 00:19:48,459
You said OTP but I don't know what    One

281
00:19:48,459 --> 00:19:49,501
time programmable.

282
00:19:49,501 --> 00:19:51,918
Could you get a little bit deeper into that?

283
00:19:51,918 --> 00:19:53,667
Yeah, an explanation, of course.

284
00:19:53,667 --> 00:19:55,999
OTP section is made up is composed by 4 bytes.

285
00:19:55,999 --> 00:19:55,999
And each one of those is when the ticket is new, brand new, they are

286
00:19:55,999 --> 00:19:58,083
all set to zero, all the bits are set to zero.

287
00:19:58,083 --> 00:19:58,083
So when you stamp your ticket and the validator machine checks how

288
00:19:58,083 --> 00:20:00,999
many zeroes are in your OTP or in target section of the OTP.

289
00:20:00,999 --> 00:20:02,999
Did you say you need another drink?

290
00:20:02,999 --> 00:20:04,417
Yeah, of course, we need it.

291
00:20:04,417 --> 00:20:04,417
So the stamp machine checks how many zeroes are left and then

292
00:20:04,417 --> 00:20:04,417
the stamp machines knows how many tickets are left

293
00:20:04,417 --> 00:20:05,999
in your multiple ride ticket.

294
00:20:05,999 --> 00:20:05,999
When you stamp your ticket the machine turns the bits

295
00:20:05,999 --> 00:20:06,999
from zero to 1.

296
00:20:06,999 --> 00:20:08,626
This operation is irreversible.

297
00:20:08,626 --> 00:20:10,751
So you can't turn them back to zero again.

298
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:10,751
Because actually, when you attempt to write something on the OTP section,

299
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:13,459
you are ordering all the bits, bit wise or they are old.

300
00:20:13,459 --> 00:20:13,459
So you know that an or operation will not give you back a zero if one

301
00:20:13,459 --> 00:20:15,209
of the two    You want another drink.

302
00:20:15,209 --> 00:20:16,209
Here you go.

303
00:20:16,209 --> 00:20:19,876
If one of the two bits is set to 1, it is impossible to get back to zero.

304
00:20:19,876 --> 00:20:20,999
Is he still talking.

305
00:20:20,999 --> 00:20:21,999
3, 2, 1, go!

306
00:20:21,999 --> 00:20:22,999
(Applause) Okay.

307
00:20:22,999 --> 00:20:22,999
So when all the bits when all the bits are turned to 1,

308
00:20:22,999 --> 00:20:22,999
the stamp machine is aware that your ticket has run

309
00:20:22,999 --> 00:20:23,999
out of rides.

310
00:20:23,999 --> 00:20:23,999
And so the stamp machine says your ticket

311
00:20:23,999 --> 00:20:24,999
is empty now.

312
00:20:24,999 --> 00:20:24,999
So our vulnerability exploits the system because if you freeze

313
00:20:24,999 --> 00:20:24,999
the actual number of rides left, the machine cannot turn those bits

314
00:20:24,999 --> 00:20:27,999
from 0 to 1 and locking forever the status of your rides left.

315
00:20:27,999 --> 00:20:27,999
So, if you can make this section read only, the machine won't be able any

316
00:20:27,999 --> 00:20:29,209
more to turn those to one.

317
00:20:29,209 --> 00:20:32,459
And so you have none, three rides, four rides, locked forever.

318
00:20:32,459 --> 00:20:32,459
So your ticket will be four rides and no one will change it the number

319
00:20:32,459 --> 00:20:33,459
of rides left.

320
00:20:33,459 --> 00:20:34,542
And that is the point.

321
00:20:34,542 --> 00:20:34,542
That is --    So, if you lock the car like that,

322
00:20:34,542 --> 00:20:36,999
what effect does that have then on the time stamp.

323
00:20:36,999 --> 00:20:36,999
If you verified your card, will the not it not have

324
00:20:36,999 --> 00:20:39,209
a time stamp from the first time you used it?

325
00:20:39,209 --> 00:20:40,918
Can you repeat the question?

326
00:20:40,918 --> 00:20:42,751
Sure, you have two attacks, right?

327
00:20:42,751 --> 00:20:42,751
Your attack is locking the card so you can't remove rides

328
00:20:42,751 --> 00:20:42,751
from it and the other is modifying the time of th-- e but, if you lock

329
00:20:42,751 --> 00:20:44,417
the card, does it not lock the time?

330
00:20:44,417 --> 00:20:45,417
No.

331
00:20:45,417 --> 00:20:46,876
It doesn't lock the time?

332
00:20:46,876 --> 00:20:49,834
No, because the time stamp is stored in the data sector.

333
00:20:49,834 --> 00:20:51,501
The rights is stored in OTP sector.

334
00:20:51,501 --> 00:20:51,501
So we can lock only OTP sector and the left data sector read only

335
00:20:51,501 --> 00:20:52,501
and writable.

336
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:52,501
You said that you used C and C++ to write the code and I'd

337
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:54,375
like to know which library did you use.

338
00:20:54,375 --> 00:20:56,209
Actually, it's written in Python.

339
00:20:56,209 --> 00:20:56,209
we plan to import it to C.

340
00:20:56,209 --> 00:20:56,209
In python we're using a standard tool called NFC tool,

341
00:20:56,209 --> 00:20:56,209
which is open source, you can find it on Google code or

342
00:20:56,209 --> 00:20:59,375
on but remember you can compile it for Linux and totally free.

343
00:20:59,375 --> 00:20:59,375
For C and C++, there is a C that is also open source, we'll use it when

344
00:20:59,375 --> 00:21:01,501
in the few weeks, I hope to have a new tool.

345
00:21:01,501 --> 00:21:02,501
Okay.

346
00:21:02,501 --> 00:21:02,501
Could you could you tell me a good book for study the protocol

347
00:21:02,501 --> 00:21:04,167
and NFC protocol or you don't know?

348
00:21:04,167 --> 00:21:05,250
Well, I don't know.

349
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:07,083
Okay, just research on Internet.

350
00:21:07,083 --> 00:21:08,083
Okay.

351
00:21:08,083 --> 00:21:08,083
They look at first vulnerability of 2011 and then we do empirical

352
00:21:08,083 --> 00:21:10,751
results and we start to study on the vertical tool.

353
00:21:10,751 --> 00:21:12,584
So we didn't have book or just Google.

354
00:21:12,584 --> 00:21:13,584
Okay, nice.

355
00:21:13,584 --> 00:21:14,584
Next?

356
00:21:14,584 --> 00:21:15,667
Any other questions?

357
00:21:15,667 --> 00:21:16,667
Maybe there.

358
00:21:16,667 --> 00:21:17,667
No question.

359
00:21:17,667 --> 00:21:17,667
The proximal, we plan to use it for attack because if we can't,

360
00:21:17,667 --> 00:21:17,667
the code data because it's somewhere encrypted,

361
00:21:17,667 --> 00:21:17,667
software encrypted, we can still sniff the data

362
00:21:17,667 --> 00:21:19,999
because the communication is totally clear.

363
00:21:19,999 --> 00:21:19,999
And the stamp using the so we stamp only

364
00:21:19,999 --> 00:21:19,999
the data sector without the OTP sector and so also,

365
00:21:19,999 --> 00:21:22,709
if you encrypt the data sector we can have free rides.

366
00:21:22,709 --> 00:21:24,918
So yes, the ULTRALIGHT is totally broken.

367
00:21:24,918 --> 00:21:25,918
Turin, Italy.

368
00:21:25,918 --> 00:21:29,125
You want to come and have a visit of Turin we offer free booth rides.

369
00:21:29,125 --> 00:21:30,125
Cheap 1 with the bus.

370
00:21:30,125 --> 00:21:31,918
I think Bologna but I'm not sure.

371
00:21:31,918 --> 00:21:31,918
And I think Milan is going to upgrade system to NFC

372
00:21:31,918 --> 00:21:34,334
but at the moment I only know of Turin and Bologna.

373
00:21:34,334 --> 00:21:35,999
The point is that the I'm sorry.

374
00:21:35,999 --> 00:21:36,999
The question?

375
00:21:36,999 --> 00:21:36,999
The point is the transportation system is using

376
00:21:36,999 --> 00:21:40,083
the MIFARE ULTRALIGHT because cheaper than other NFC chips.

377
00:21:40,083 --> 00:21:40,083
It is cheaper because it is hardware encrypted and that's

378
00:21:40,083 --> 00:21:42,250
the problem of the NFC MIFARE ULTRALIGHT.

379
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:42,250
But the corporation systems do not realize that and they're still using those

380
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:43,959
chips even if they are cheaper.

381
00:21:43,959 --> 00:21:44,999
So that's the point.

382
00:21:44,999 --> 00:21:45,999
Any other questions?

383
00:21:45,999 --> 00:21:49,125
An card is different type of NFC chips, they're MIFARE plastic.

384
00:21:49,125 --> 00:21:50,999
They're broken like six years ago.

385
00:21:50,999 --> 00:21:51,999
They are less fun.

386
00:21:51,999 --> 00:21:52,999
Anyone else?

387
00:21:52,999 --> 00:21:55,334
If you want some stamps, we're just outside.

388
00:21:55,334 --> 00:21:56,334
We can give them.

389
00:21:56,334 --> 00:21:57,999
Thank you very much, once again.

390
00:21:57,999 --> 00:21:59,626
And I hope you enjoyed this talk.

391
00:21:59,626 --> 00:22:00,626
And Okay.

392
00:22:00,626 --> 00:22:03,083
You made us happy to explain you all those things.

393
00:22:03,083 --> 00:22:05,125
And I think it was a very good experience.

394
00:22:05,125 --> 00:22:06,375
So thank you once again.

395
00:22:06,375 --> 00:22:07,375
Okay.

396
00:22:07,375 --> 00:22:08,375
Yeah.

397
00:22:08,375 --> 00:22:08,375
The next speaker I'm going to go grab him if you're here

398
00:22:08,375 --> 00:22:11,459
for what you thought was a 30 minute talk is actually an hour.

399
00:22:11,459 --> 00:22:11,459
If you read your pamphlet there, you'll see in the bottom

400
00:22:11,459 --> 00:22:13,459
in parens that the other starts at 1600.

401
00:22:13,459 --> 00:22:14,918
So so excuse me for a second.

402
00:22:14,918 --> 00:22:15,918
There we go.

403
00:22:15,918 --> 00:22:16,918
That's better.

404
00:22:16,918 --> 00:22:19,626
So let me go get him and we'll get him started up for you.

405
00:22:19,626 --> 00:22:22,083
And we'll get him settled in and then get it going.

406
00:22:22,083 --> 00:22:23,083
Okay.
