1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,834
Is there another one down here?

2
00:00:01,834 --> 00:00:02,834
I've got that video.

3
00:00:02,834 --> 00:00:03,876
I've got that video.

4
00:00:03,876 --> 00:00:04,999
Here's the walking mic.

5
00:00:04,999 --> 00:00:08,709
So we've got, like, two minutes before we actually get this thing going.

6
00:00:08,709 --> 00:00:08,709
And as you can tell, we're experiencing technical difficulties

7
00:00:08,709 --> 00:00:09,709
please stand by.

8
00:00:09,709 --> 00:00:10,709
Cursory stuff.

9
00:00:10,709 --> 00:00:11,999
Q&A mic, right over there.

10
00:00:11,999 --> 00:00:11,999
Once we get rid of our wonderful technical difficulties,

11
00:00:11,999 --> 00:00:11,999
you will want to use the Q&A mic whenever you ask

12
00:00:11,999 --> 00:00:11,999
a question or at least repeat the question so it gets put

13
00:00:11,999 --> 00:00:12,999
up on the video.

14
00:00:12,999 --> 00:00:12,999
So people that watch the video later on actually know what kind

15
00:00:12,999 --> 00:00:14,250
of question we're asking.

16
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:14,250
Next, if you have to leave, use the three exit doors in the back

17
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:15,250
of the cabin.

18
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:16,250
Back of the room.

19
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:16,250
Do not try to exit the doors as you leave

20
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:16,250
because that's crowded and there are going to be lines there today and

21
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:16,250
the room is going to get crowded so it helps the flow

22
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:17,334
if you go out the back.

23
00:00:17,334 --> 00:00:18,999
And with that, are we having fun?

24
00:00:18,999 --> 00:00:19,999
Yeah (whistle).

25
00:00:19,999 --> 00:00:20,999
Who's hungover?

26
00:00:20,999 --> 00:00:22,999
The rest of you all, not working it right.

27
00:00:22,999 --> 00:00:24,459
Got to have more fun out here.

28
00:00:24,459 --> 00:00:25,584
It's Vegas, you know?

29
00:00:25,584 --> 00:00:27,999
you don't have to tell back home what happened.

30
00:00:27,999 --> 00:00:29,834
But you can tell what happened here.

31
00:00:29,834 --> 00:00:32,083
What's your favorite talk that you've gone to?

32
00:00:32,083 --> 00:00:33,083
Anybody?

33
00:00:33,083 --> 00:00:34,250
This is entertaining.

34
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:35,250
Okay.

35
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:36,250
Anybody got a joke?

36
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:37,250
This one.

37
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:38,250
Nice!

38
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:39,250
(Laughter).

39
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:40,292
Squirrels and nuts.

40
00:00:40,292 --> 00:00:41,292
Anyway, okay.

41
00:00:41,292 --> 00:00:42,375
You'd have to do that.

42
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:43,375
Yeah.

43
00:00:43,375 --> 00:00:44,375
Here.

44
00:00:44,375 --> 00:00:44,375
I guess since we're going to start this off, we'll let

45
00:00:44,375 --> 00:00:44,375
the speakers start the show because they might have some things

46
00:00:44,375 --> 00:00:47,626
to talk about at the beginning before they start their slides.

47
00:00:47,626 --> 00:00:47,626
So we'll let the other guys do their job and we'll let

48
00:00:47,626 --> 00:00:48,626
the speakers start.

49
00:00:48,626 --> 00:00:49,626
So have fun.

50
00:00:49,626 --> 00:00:50,751
Oh, I got to call home.

51
00:00:50,751 --> 00:00:51,751
You're fine.

52
00:00:51,751 --> 00:00:52,751
Okay.

53
00:00:52,751 --> 00:00:53,751
Okay.

54
00:00:53,751 --> 00:00:55,334
Well, good morning, everyone.

55
00:00:55,334 --> 00:00:56,667
Welcome to DEF CON again.

56
00:00:56,667 --> 00:00:58,792
We're glad to see you all up this morning.

57
00:00:58,792 --> 00:01:00,292
And my name is Marc Weber Tobias.

58
00:01:00,292 --> 00:01:02,209
This is Tobias Bluzmanis, my partner.

59
00:01:02,209 --> 00:01:02,209
And hopefully, they'll get our audio problems

60
00:01:02,209 --> 00:01:03,209
dealt with.

61
00:01:03,209 --> 00:01:04,209
And our hey, okay.

62
00:01:04,209 --> 00:01:05,999
So we've got video on both screens?

63
00:01:05,999 --> 00:01:07,125
But no teleprompter?

64
00:01:07,125 --> 00:01:08,667
MARC WEBER TOBIAS: Right.

65
00:01:08,667 --> 00:01:10,584
But the president is not here, either.

66
00:01:10,584 --> 00:01:10,584
So Toby and I work for security labs which

67
00:01:10,584 --> 00:01:10,584
is in our office and we work for a number

68
00:01:10,584 --> 00:01:12,417
of major lock companies in the world.

69
00:01:12,417 --> 00:01:12,417
We have a team that analyzes mainly high

70
00:01:12,417 --> 00:01:12,417
security locks but some consumer level products

71
00:01:12,417 --> 00:01:15,709
as well for security vulnerabilities mainly for covert entry.

72
00:01:15,709 --> 00:01:15,709
So a few years ago at DEF CON we talked

73
00:01:15,709 --> 00:01:15,709
about a number of different consumer level locks

74
00:01:15,709 --> 00:01:16,999
but not really in detail.

75
00:01:16,999 --> 00:01:16,999
And as a result of that, we ended up filing a complaint with one

76
00:01:16,999 --> 00:01:18,125
of the standards organizations about the lock we're going

77
00:01:18,125 --> 00:01:20,542
to talk about today.

78
00:01:20,792 --> 00:01:22,501
And we figured a couple years would go by,

79
00:01:22,501 --> 00:01:25,834
some things would occur, maybe the problems would be remedied

80
00:01:25,834 --> 00:01:27,751
but they weren't.

81
00:01:27,959 --> 00:01:31,292
So today we're now the monitor went away here

82
00:01:31,292 --> 00:01:36,834
but I guess we're okay So today we're going to talk about one

83
00:01:36,834 --> 00:01:41,667
of the most popular consumer level mechanical cylinders

84
00:01:41,667 --> 00:01:44,501
in the United States.

85
00:01:46,667 --> 00:01:50,626
And the problems, the design problems that we found.

86
00:01:50,626 --> 00:01:52,083
How many of you guys have this lock

87
00:01:52,083 --> 00:01:53,999
on your doors?

88
00:01:54,417 --> 00:01:55,417
Ooh.

89
00:01:56,751 --> 00:01:59,751
So everybody knows what this is.

90
00:01:59,918 --> 00:02:01,250
Okay.

91
00:02:01,709 --> 00:02:02,999
Yeah.

92
00:02:03,334 --> 00:02:08,334
So this is probably in the United States there's really two

93
00:02:08,334 --> 00:02:13,999
major consumer level brands in the United States.

94
00:02:13,999 --> 00:02:15,167
This is one of them.

95
00:02:15,167 --> 00:02:17,999
And they're in every DIY store, hardware store.

96
00:02:17,999 --> 00:02:22,375
And a lot of folks believe that these are really secure.

97
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:24,542
And in many ways they are.

98
00:02:24,542 --> 00:02:29,709
The problem is, we'll point out to you in critical ways, they're not.

99
00:02:29,709 --> 00:02:30,542
So we're going to go through we've done

100
00:02:30,542 --> 00:02:33,250
a pretty detailed slide presentation.

101
00:02:33,334 --> 00:02:38,375
And with a lot of graphics and animation that we hope you guys

102
00:02:38,375 --> 00:02:41,999
enjoy to detail the problems.

103
00:02:42,334 --> 00:02:47,250
And we recognize that a lot of folks can't afford high security

104
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:51,709
cylinders that are $75, $100, $150 a piece.

105
00:02:51,709 --> 00:02:52,999
We do understand that.

106
00:02:53,375 --> 00:02:58,250
And I guess some locks is better than no locks on your door.

107
00:02:58,709 --> 00:03:03,083
But there's also a false sense of security that these kind

108
00:03:03,083 --> 00:03:08,375
of locks provide a higher level security than they do.

109
00:03:08,375 --> 00:03:12,334
And that's also enhanced by packaging and marketing statements

110
00:03:12,334 --> 00:03:15,626
by the manufacturer, especially with regard

111
00:03:15,626 --> 00:03:19,999
to the Builders Hardware Manufacturer's Association standard

112
00:03:19,999 --> 00:03:23,417
for it's a consumer commercial level standard

113
00:03:23,417 --> 00:03:26,292
that has much more to do with endurance

114
00:03:26,292 --> 00:03:29,209
and durable than security.

115
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:30,999
And that's the case in this lock.

116
00:03:30,999 --> 00:03:34,542
So Kwiksets are really easy to understand.

117
00:03:34,542 --> 00:03:37,292
Today we're going to talk about their SmartKey versus

118
00:03:37,292 --> 00:03:40,459
conventional pin tumbler locks.

119
00:03:40,459 --> 00:03:42,083
And a number of ways we've determined

120
00:03:42,083 --> 00:03:44,999
to open them very rapidly and that present some

121
00:03:44,999 --> 00:03:47,584
serious vulnerabilities.

122
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:51,083
Now, you'll notice that the lock on the left hand side of the screen,

123
00:03:51,083 --> 00:03:54,999
that's a SmartKey because it's got a little slot to the left

124
00:03:54,999 --> 00:03:56,918
of the key way.

125
00:03:56,918 --> 00:03:59,292
That means it's a reprogrammable lock.

126
00:03:59,292 --> 00:04:01,709
So what we're going to do is begin this morning,

127
00:04:01,709 --> 00:04:05,375
letting you listen to a couple pieces of audio.

128
00:04:05,959 --> 00:04:10,999
We called customer service repeatedly to ask them how secure their locks

129
00:04:10,999 --> 00:04:14,999
were as if we were going to buy some.

130
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:17,292
And we wanted to set the stage

131
00:04:17,292 --> 00:04:23,459
because this either these folks aren't trained properly or they're making

132
00:04:23,459 --> 00:04:27,999
statements that they shouldn't be making.

133
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:32,999
So either way we thought you would enjoy the questions.

134
00:04:32,999 --> 00:04:34,918
These are about two minute clips each.

135
00:04:34,918 --> 00:04:38,375
And nothing has been edited out that was relevant.

136
00:04:38,751 --> 00:04:41,584
Only the chit chat between us but these I tried to edit

137
00:04:41,584 --> 00:04:44,459
out to the relevant statements.

138
00:04:44,459 --> 00:04:48,209
So this first one was on in June of this year with Brian.

139
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:51,751
Audio clip: Quick set, this is Brian.

140
00:04:51,751 --> 00:04:52,751
Can I help you.

141
00:04:52,751 --> 00:04:54,751
A couple questions on SmartKey.

142
00:04:54,751 --> 00:04:55,751
Okay.

143
00:04:55,751 --> 00:04:59,626
So my only concern is quick set comfortable and basically

144
00:04:59,626 --> 00:05:04,876
debunked this that there's no way to stick a screwdriver, just

145
00:05:04,876 --> 00:05:09,083
a common tool into the lock and open it.

146
00:05:09,083 --> 00:05:11,584
Technician: No, that would be a negative.

147
00:05:11,999 --> 00:05:17,999
I mean, if that if it was that easy to pick to pick a Kwikset lock,

148
00:05:17,999 --> 00:05:22,834
they would be having us do recalls, okay.

149
00:05:22,834 --> 00:05:24,125
This customer has this unit.

150
00:05:24,125 --> 00:05:26,209
Get a call tag, have a prepaid label sent back and sent back

151
00:05:26,209 --> 00:05:28,375
to our quality control.

152
00:05:28,375 --> 00:05:30,083
There's nothing like that.

153
00:05:30,083 --> 00:05:31,334
It's business as usual.

154
00:05:31,334 --> 00:05:34,501
Are you guys are aware or been trained of any tools

155
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:39,834
out there that will open these or is this all just nonsense.

156
00:05:39,834 --> 00:05:43,083
Technician: No, without the key you can't open it, no.

157
00:05:43,083 --> 00:05:47,876
Just so I can tell my boss, as far as Kwikset is concerned,

158
00:05:47,876 --> 00:05:52,125
other than drilling these, if you don't have the key,

159
00:05:52,125 --> 00:05:55,417
you're not going to get in.

160
00:05:55,417 --> 00:05:56,417
No.

161
00:05:56,417 --> 00:05:57,792
That's the bottom line.

162
00:05:57,792 --> 00:05:59,501
If you stick anything foreign inside the key way is just going

163
00:05:59,501 --> 00:06:02,083
to make it that much harder to open up.

164
00:06:02,292 --> 00:06:05,999
Basically what you're telling me is it isn't going to happen.

165

You can sabotage the key way which    (Ended)    MARC

WEBER: That was Brian.

167
00:06:12,999 --> 00:06:14,999
So you're starting to get the picture.

168
00:06:15,626 --> 00:06:17,292
This is Satima.

169
00:06:17,292 --> 00:06:19,876
(start audio)    How can I help you?

170
00:06:19,876 --> 00:06:20,999
Are you tech support?

171
00:06:20,999 --> 00:06:21,999
Yes, I am.

172
00:06:21,999 --> 00:06:24,083
Ma'am, we're looking to buy a large amount

173
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:26,999
of your SmartKey cylinders.

174
00:06:26,999 --> 00:06:29,209
So I have some questions.

175
00:06:29,209 --> 00:06:30,209
Go ahead.

176
00:06:30,209 --> 00:06:31,292
Are you technical?

177
00:06:31,292 --> 00:06:32,292
Yes.

178
00:06:32,292 --> 00:06:35,834
How about forced entry?

179
00:06:35,834 --> 00:06:36,999
How difficult are they?

180
00:06:36,999 --> 00:06:41,542
Like the old locks you could take a screwdriver and put a lot

181
00:06:41,542 --> 00:06:44,209
of pressure on them.

182
00:06:44,209 --> 00:06:45,542
Same thing with these.

183
00:06:45,542 --> 00:06:46,999
You can line up the springs.

184
00:06:46,999 --> 00:06:50,209
That's what the screwdriver would do, right?

185
00:06:50,209 --> 00:06:54,999
Force the springs to align and open the lock.

186
00:06:55,209 --> 00:06:56,250
With these ones, you can't even put

187
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:58,792
a flat head screwdriver in there.

188
00:06:58,792 --> 00:07:00,250
You can't.

189
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:01,250
You can't, no.

190
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:04,292
Because there's racks we call them.

191
00:07:04,292 --> 00:07:07,834
They're coming from up and down up an down direction.

192
00:07:07,999 --> 00:07:09,167
Not just up.

193
00:07:09,167 --> 00:07:10,167
Okay.

194
00:07:10,999 --> 00:07:13,751
So this stuff on the Internet is not true?

195
00:07:13,751 --> 00:07:17,334
That you can stick a screwdriver in them and open them.

196
00:07:17,334 --> 00:07:19,334
No, no.

197
00:07:19,334 --> 00:07:24,834
We were aware of that video and you know, we found out about it.

198
00:07:24,834 --> 00:07:29,083
But they did something else before they showed that video.

199
00:07:29,501 --> 00:07:32,667
I believe that's what I heard that they did something else

200
00:07:32,667 --> 00:07:35,209
to the cylinder and then they recorded the video

201
00:07:35,209 --> 00:07:38,999
with using a flat head screwdriver and opening it.

202
00:07:38,999 --> 00:07:40,083
That's not how it works.

203
00:07:40,083 --> 00:07:42,999
So, if somebody walks up to a lock in one of our apartments,

204
00:07:42,999 --> 00:07:46,083
unless they can take that lock apart, you're telling me

205
00:07:46,083 --> 00:07:48,999
they can't open it without a key.

206
00:07:48,999 --> 00:07:50,167
That's correct, sir.

207
00:07:50,167 --> 00:07:53,876
Is there any quick way of forcing these open that

208
00:07:53,876 --> 00:07:59,626
a burglar could do, like, in 30 seconds or 15 seconds.

209
00:07:59,626 --> 00:08:00,626
No, no.

210
00:08:00,626 --> 00:08:03,792
Is there anything guys have been trained on or are aware of.

211
00:08:03,792 --> 00:08:05,542
No, no.

212
00:08:05,542 --> 00:08:06,626
Nothing like that.

213
00:08:06,626 --> 00:08:10,167
There's no tool you can just put in the cylinder and just pop it open.

214
00:08:10,167 --> 00:08:11,167
There isn't.

215
00:08:11,167 --> 00:08:15,209
There's no emergency key that we send you that will open it.

216
00:08:15,209 --> 00:08:16,209
Nothing like that.

217
00:08:16,209 --> 00:08:19,999
How long have you been with Kwikset dealing with these?

218
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:21,542
Four years.

219
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:24,292
Let's just take a 4 inch or 6 inch screwdriver which

220
00:08:24,292 --> 00:08:27,999
everybody has in their kitchen drawer and you stick it

221
00:08:27,999 --> 00:08:33,959
in the lock and you take a pair of pliers or vice grips and you turn it.

222
00:08:34,083 --> 00:08:35,542
Can you open the lock?

223
00:08:35,584 --> 00:08:36,999
No.

224
00:08:36,999 --> 00:08:39,999
What about sticking a wire through the where the key goes

225
00:08:39,999 --> 00:08:43,751
in or any other    MARC WEBER TOBIAS: Now don't jump ahead

226
00:08:43,751 --> 00:08:45,459
of yourself.

227
00:08:45,876 --> 00:08:49,459
No wire or anything like that.

228
00:08:49,459 --> 00:08:50,459
You cannot.

229
00:08:50,459 --> 00:08:51,999
No, you cannot.

230
00:08:51,999 --> 00:08:54,542
You wouldn't worry about these to protect your valuables or your house

231
00:08:54,542 --> 00:08:56,083
or apartment.

232
00:08:56,083 --> 00:09:01,459
Not at all (end audio).

233
00:09:01,459 --> 00:09:05,667
MARC WEBER TOBIAS: That's what the public is told if you call

234
00:09:05,667 --> 00:09:10,334
in and want to he no if these locks are secure.

235
00:09:12,999 --> 00:09:16,501
I don't think there's any malice on the part of their employees.

236
00:09:16,501 --> 00:09:17,626
They just don't know.

237
00:09:17,999 --> 00:09:19,876
They haven't been educated.

238
00:09:19,876 --> 00:09:22,334
There was plenty of stuff on the net a couple years ago that

239
00:09:22,334 --> 00:09:25,999
they referred to I don't know if they don't know or have been told not

240
00:09:25,999 --> 00:09:27,459
to say it.

241
00:09:27,459 --> 00:09:28,542
They just don't know.

242
00:09:28,542 --> 00:09:31,083
The reality is as we is see from a show of hands,

243
00:09:31,083 --> 00:09:35,334
there's millions of locks used in America, homes, apartments,

244
00:09:35,334 --> 00:09:38,542
businesses, they're inexpensive.

245
00:09:38,542 --> 00:09:43,751
Cylinders run 20, 30 maybe $40 a piece, they have pin tumbler models

246
00:09:43,751 --> 00:09:49,999
and SmartKey models A deadbolts and also electronic cylinders.

247
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:54,459
So it is one of the most popular locks in America.

248
00:09:54,626 --> 00:09:56,999
And they've been in business actually

249
00:09:56,999 --> 00:09:59,417
for about 60 years and again, they have

250
00:09:59,417 --> 00:10:02,459
a very diversified product line.

251
00:10:02,999 --> 00:10:05,918
These are some of their distribution channels

252
00:10:05,918 --> 00:10:09,999
as you recognize Home Depots, Lowe's, Ace Hardware, lots

253
00:10:09,999 --> 00:10:13,542
of folks are carrying these locks.

254
00:10:13,834 --> 00:10:15,999
Mainly they're sold through DIY channels,

255
00:10:15,999 --> 00:10:20,042
do it yourself charges rather than the locksmiths.

256
00:10:20,125 --> 00:10:23,667
A lot of locksmiths actually don't care for these cylinders

257
00:10:23,667 --> 00:10:28,584
because it circumvents their revenue and they're low quality locks.

258
00:10:28,709 --> 00:10:32,334
And this is a shot I think from Home Depot.

259
00:10:32,667 --> 00:10:35,999
And they're very, very prevalent.

260
00:10:35,999 --> 00:10:37,999
They've got great marketing.

261
00:10:38,167 --> 00:10:41,292
They're in residential and apartment facilities.

262
00:10:41,292 --> 00:10:45,918
So Kwikset, Weiser Baldwin, the basics.

263
00:10:45,918 --> 00:10:46,918
Toby?

264
00:10:46,918 --> 00:10:50,000
TOBIAS BLUZMANIS: No, keep going.

265
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,999
MARC WEBER TOBIAS: We're talking about pin tumbler locks which

266
00:10:51,999 --> 00:10:54,667
is their older version and SmartKey.

267
00:10:54,667 --> 00:10:56,751
SmartKey will show you the difference.

268
00:10:56,751 --> 00:10:59,667
In some ways it is a very clever clock.

269
00:10:59,751 --> 00:11:03,626
The pin tumbler locks they sell are 5 or 6 pin.

270
00:11:04,083 --> 00:11:06,667
SmartKey is 5 pin.

271
00:11:06,792 --> 00:11:08,626
The SmartKey, there's attributes that

272
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:12,999
the pin tumbler locks don't have as far as security.

273
00:11:12,999 --> 00:11:15,375
The pin tumbler locks, if some of you guys were

274
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:19,334
around several years ago we had 11 year old Jenna Lynn bumping

275
00:11:19,334 --> 00:11:20,999
them open.

276
00:11:20,999 --> 00:11:23,375
You all remember Jenna Lynn?

277
00:11:23,375 --> 00:11:25,125
She's probably in college now.

278
00:11:25,459 --> 00:11:29,626
But she became a YouTube star a little girl in one minute figured

279
00:11:29,626 --> 00:11:33,999
out how to open these locks, whack whack, they're open.

280
00:11:34,501 --> 00:11:37,999
The problem is they all have the same key way.

281
00:11:38,334 --> 00:11:40,792
There's no duplication protection.

282
00:11:40,792 --> 00:11:42,542
There's no key control protection.

283
00:11:42,542 --> 00:11:46,083
These are definitely not for high security installations.

284
00:11:46,083 --> 00:11:48,501
They're mainly residential and apartments.

285
00:11:48,751 --> 00:11:52,876
So Kwikset history as I said, they've been around about 60 years,

286
00:11:52,876 --> 00:11:55,999
they're very easily compromised.

287
00:11:55,999 --> 00:11:57,999
And the SmartKey was introduced

288
00:11:57,999 --> 00:12:05,250
around 2008 but probably a lot of you folks still have pin tumbler locks.

289
00:12:05,375 --> 00:12:08,834
You probably wouldn't know the difference unless you look

290
00:12:08,834 --> 00:12:11,459
at the little slot, the right hand photograph,

291
00:12:11,459 --> 00:12:16,459
the little slots to the left of the key way, that indicates Kwikset.

292
00:12:16,751 --> 00:12:20,250
But it's the same key that will open these locks.

293
00:12:20,751 --> 00:12:24,918
So here's the difference: On the left is a pin tumbler where it's

294
00:12:24,918 --> 00:12:30,292
a conventional lock with two pins and a spring in each chamber.

295
00:12:30,292 --> 00:12:33,083
On the right hand side is SmartKey.

296
00:12:33,083 --> 00:12:36,876
It's much more complicated design but same key will open it.

297
00:12:36,999 --> 00:12:43,667
Actually, you can see what they share is the same key.

298
00:12:43,667 --> 00:12:47,834
What Kwikset did with this is try to use the same key

299
00:12:47,834 --> 00:12:53,167
for their locks so you have one that is pin tumbler design and

300
00:12:53,167 --> 00:12:57,999
the other you can reprogram and supposedly more secure,

301
00:12:57,999 --> 00:13:01,918
you cannot bump, cannot pick open the lock,

302
00:13:01,918 --> 00:13:06,999
you can probably other attacks like impressioning the key,

303
00:13:06,999 --> 00:13:10,834
you cannot do that with Kwikset.

304
00:13:10,834 --> 00:13:14,417
But on the tradeoff, we find ways more easy

305
00:13:14,417 --> 00:13:17,999
to open this Kwikset lock.

306
00:13:17,999 --> 00:13:22,876
MARC WEBER TOBIAS: So pin tumbler, they're not secure unless

307
00:13:22,876 --> 00:13:28,167
they're a lock with a number of added on attributes.

308
00:13:28,167 --> 00:13:31,083
Pin tumbler locks in this category are easy to pick,

309
00:13:31,083 --> 00:13:33,334
easy to bump open.

310
00:13:33,334 --> 00:13:37,626
Easy to impression, easy to mechanically bypass.

311
00:13:37,626 --> 00:13:40,999
Can be master key'd and it's also fairly easy to determine what

312
00:13:40,999 --> 00:13:44,626
the top level master key is and there's limited number

313
00:13:44,626 --> 00:13:46,667
of combinations.

314
00:13:46,667 --> 00:13:49,959
And these locks are fairly low tolerance locks.

315
00:13:49,959 --> 00:13:55,167
So there are many fewer keys that, in the universe of keys that

316
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:58,334
will open these locks.

317
00:13:58,334 --> 00:14:02,334
So the pin tumbler lock go ahead.

318
00:14:02,334 --> 00:14:03,834
TOBIAS BLUZMANIS: Okay.

319
00:14:03,834 --> 00:14:08,834
So we're going to go first how a pin tumbler cylinder works.

320
00:14:08,834 --> 00:14:09,834
Okay?

321
00:14:09,834 --> 00:14:11,792
In this case, we have a Kwikset cylinder, this

322
00:14:11,792 --> 00:14:14,876
is what you see from the outside.

323
00:14:15,083 --> 00:14:19,999
And the parts we have a shell that is the outside portion, the plug, and

324
00:14:19,999 --> 00:14:23,792
the key slot where you put the key.

325
00:14:23,792 --> 00:14:27,209
That's what mainly more people know about the lock.

326
00:14:27,209 --> 00:14:30,999
So what is inside isn't a pin stack.

327
00:14:30,999 --> 00:14:34,083
You have a spring series of pin tumblers

328
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:37,626
and you have shear line.

329
00:14:38,083 --> 00:14:43,167
That shear line is where you have to move the pin stack in order

330
00:14:43,167 --> 00:14:46,083
to create and    MARC WEBER TOBIAS: A

331
00:14:46,083 --> 00:14:48,209
clear surface.

332
00:14:48,209 --> 00:14:54,542
TOBIAS BLUZMANIS: Separate those pins in order for the lock to turn.

333
00:14:54,918 --> 00:14:56,125
Okay?

334
00:14:56,125 --> 00:14:59,167
So that's the basics of a pin tumbler.

335
00:14:59,167 --> 00:15:01,959
You have to get that pin on shear line depending

336
00:15:01,959 --> 00:15:04,999
on the height of the key so you can unlock

337
00:15:04,999 --> 00:15:06,918
the cylinder.

338
00:15:06,999 --> 00:15:11,375
Now, that's one pin on regular pin tumbler, you have

339
00:15:11,375 --> 00:15:14,083
more than one pin.

340
00:15:14,083 --> 00:15:18,375
You have in this case 5 pins, different heights on the bottom pin,

341
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:22,459
which is the portion that fits the key.

342
00:15:22,459 --> 00:15:26,667
So when you put the key, you see all the bottom pins line

343
00:15:26,667 --> 00:15:29,375
up with the cylinder.

344
00:15:29,375 --> 00:15:35,999
So that cylinder can turn if they match pins match the key.

345
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:39,999
So if you put the wrong key, what you have

346
00:15:39,999 --> 00:15:44,709
is some pins either extend to the lock or something

347
00:15:44,709 --> 00:15:49,959
from the top blocking the rotation of that pin.

348
00:15:49,959 --> 00:15:51,999
It's a very simple design.

349
00:15:51,999 --> 00:15:54,501
Has been for many, many years.

350
00:15:54,501 --> 00:16:00,250
And most manufacturers work around this design adding side bars,

351
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:07,876
third levels of locking devices but it's the most common element.

352
00:16:07,999 --> 00:16:11,667
MARC WEBER TOBIAS: Are we okay?

353
00:16:11,667 --> 00:16:12,667
Okay.

354
00:16:14,167 --> 00:16:21,125
TOBIAS BLUZMANIS: So that's what is inside on a regular pin tumbler.

355
00:16:23,167 --> 00:16:30,334
And we said this SmartKey is not a pin tumbler lock.

356
00:16:30,334 --> 00:16:34,375
If you look inside, the very different components that

357
00:16:34,375 --> 00:16:38,999
will make that lock be able to reprogram the lock

358
00:16:38,999 --> 00:16:41,959
to any specific key.

359
00:16:41,999 --> 00:16:45,999
And to make it more secure against bumping and picking

360
00:16:45,999 --> 00:16:50,334
and some sort of impressioning techniques.

361
00:16:50,459 --> 00:16:52,167
MARC WEBER TOBIAS: This is what

362
00:16:52,167 --> 00:16:55,709
the inside of a SmartKey looks like.

363
00:16:55,709 --> 00:16:57,459
We'll blow that up in just a minute.

364
00:16:57,459 --> 00:17:00,626
But this is a side bar base lock which means it's

365
00:17:00,626 --> 00:17:05,667
a different locking mechanism that keeps the plug where you stick

366
00:17:05,667 --> 00:17:08,667
the key into from turning.

367
00:17:08,667 --> 00:17:13,959
And this design actually was developed in 1978.

368
00:17:14,083 --> 00:17:18,999
The original design here was in over a million hotel rooms

369
00:17:18,999 --> 00:17:24,626
because it aloud it was the first real programmable lock.

370
00:17:24,626 --> 00:17:26,083
Very, very clever.

371
00:17:26,083 --> 00:17:31,083
And then it was improved by a company in Italy called Rialda.

372
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:34,083
And then Kwikset took the Rialda design and modified it

373
00:17:34,083 --> 00:17:38,125
for the consumer market in the United States.

374
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:40,876
So attributes of SmartKey.

375
00:17:40,876 --> 00:17:42,584
It's only a 5 pin lock.

376
00:17:42,584 --> 00:17:46,292
And when we say pins, they're really not pins.

377
00:17:46,292 --> 00:17:47,626
They're sliders.

378
00:17:47,626 --> 00:17:49,459
And there's a really big difference.

379
00:17:49,459 --> 00:17:53,751
Pins mechanically and physically are secure against torque

380
00:17:53,751 --> 00:17:56,125
and forced attack.

381
00:17:56,125 --> 00:17:59,584
The sliders in these locks are not quite so secure.

382
00:17:59,709 --> 00:18:04,083
In this lock there's one side bar that really provides the entire security

383
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:05,999
of this lock.

384
00:18:05,999 --> 00:18:09,167
They are extremely pick resistant.

385
00:18:09,334 --> 00:18:12,876
There's an underwriters laboratory standard

386
00:18:12,876 --> 00:18:18,999
437 which defines picking for commercial and high security locks.

387
00:18:18,999 --> 00:18:21,999
Kwikset actually meets this standard.

388
00:18:21,999 --> 00:18:25,667
That means these are not be picked in under 10 minutes.

389
00:18:25,667 --> 00:18:28,083
They are very, very pick resistant.

390
00:18:28,083 --> 00:18:31,626
And they also cannot be bumped, period.

391
00:18:31,626 --> 00:18:33,876
Because there's no pin pin tumblers.

392
00:18:33,876 --> 00:18:39,083
These are sliders so there's nothing to bump open to which in a way,

393
00:18:39,083 --> 00:18:45,125
as we refer to this lock, it's one of the most secure insecure locks

394
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:47,125
in America.

395
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:53,501
Now, obviously those are opposite ends of the spectrum.

396
00:18:53,501 --> 00:18:54,834
That's what it is.

397
00:18:54,834 --> 00:18:57,501
From the picking standpoint, from the impressioning standpoint,

398
00:18:57,501 --> 00:19:02,250
from the bumping standpoint you're essentially not going to reopen them.

399
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:05,250
The problem is that's trumped by other ways we'll show you.

400
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:07,999
The other really cool thing how many of you guys have SmartKey versus

401
00:19:07,999 --> 00:19:10,876
the old pin tumblers or do you know.

402
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:13,167
So not that many.

403
00:19:13,834 --> 00:19:17,626
SmartKey are backwards compatible.

404
00:19:17,999 --> 00:19:21,918
You can instantly reprogram them with without a locksmith.

405
00:19:21,999 --> 00:19:25,334
Stick the correct key into the lock, turn about 30Â°.

406
00:19:25,417 --> 00:19:26,501
Pull it out.

407
00:19:26,501 --> 00:19:29,292
Stick a new key in, turn it back to 12:00, that lock is reprogrammed

408
00:19:29,292 --> 00:19:31,626
with a new combination.

409
00:19:31,626 --> 00:19:33,999
It is a very, very clever and desirable option

410
00:19:33,999 --> 00:19:36,125
in the marketplace.

411
00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:39,083
But there's a lot of security tradeoffs to get there.

412
00:19:39,083 --> 00:19:40,918
TOBIAS BLUZMANIS: Definitely.

413
00:19:40,918 --> 00:19:44,125
We have to also we understand the space they have to work

414
00:19:44,125 --> 00:19:46,626
is also the same.

415
00:19:46,626 --> 00:19:51,834
So to put all this different attributes in a lock.

416
00:19:51,876 --> 00:19:57,999
It becomes a very difficult task to do.

417
00:19:57,999 --> 00:20:00,999
MARC WEBER TOBIAS: The other attributes it has one primary kiwi

418
00:20:00,999 --> 00:20:04,709
everywhere which is a problem because it's easy to make keys

419
00:20:04,709 --> 00:20:06,834
or duplicate keys.

420
00:20:06,834 --> 00:20:08,626
There is no key control.

421
00:20:08,626 --> 00:20:11,250
Now, they make a special deadbolt lock

422
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:16,292
for limited master keying for apartment houses that we'll

423
00:20:16,292 --> 00:20:18,042
show you.

424
00:20:18,626 --> 00:20:24,375
And they think that that key cannot be duplicated easily.

425
00:20:25,334 --> 00:20:27,709
Toby, you want to do that this one?

426
00:20:27,709 --> 00:20:28,999
TOBIAS BLUZMANIS: Okay.

427
00:20:29,459 --> 00:20:31,292
We showed you at the beginning how

428
00:20:31,292 --> 00:20:34,000
a pin tumbler lock works.

429
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,083
This is a SmartKey.

430
00:20:37,667 --> 00:20:41,999
The first you notice is the little slot on the side.

431
00:20:41,999 --> 00:20:44,542
That's to change the combination when you follow

432
00:20:44,542 --> 00:20:46,999
the right procedure.

433
00:20:50,459 --> 00:20:54,999
We told you on the inside totally different.

434
00:20:55,125 --> 00:20:59,626
This lock is based on a side bar design.

435
00:20:59,626 --> 00:21:05,542
You see a pin you see a slider on next to the pin and side bar.

436
00:21:05,542 --> 00:21:07,834
MARC WEBER TOBIAS: Side bar is in purple.

437
00:21:09,083 --> 00:21:17,083
TOBIAS BLUZMANIS: Side bar tried to retract but it's blocked by that slider.

438
00:21:17,083 --> 00:21:22,999
So in order for that lock to open, the pin has to move the slider

439
00:21:22,999 --> 00:21:29,959
to the right height so that side bar can enter groove of the slider and

440
00:21:29,959 --> 00:21:33,083
the lock can be opened.

441
00:21:33,918 --> 00:21:45,751
That's the principle of this SmartKey as far as the slider bar combination.

442
00:21:48,501 --> 00:21:51,584
The way they can make the different combinations

443
00:21:51,584 --> 00:21:55,584
is the way that they fit the pin to the slider.

444
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:57,999
With different channels.

445
00:21:59,209 --> 00:22:03,584
The slider stays in the same position, slide bar at the same position,

446
00:22:03,584 --> 00:22:09,083
but the pin configuration pin slider changes for different depths from 1 6.

447
00:22:09,083 --> 00:22:12,751
MARC WEBER TOBIAS: The relationship between the pin tumbler

448
00:22:12,751 --> 00:22:16,999
on the right hand side and the yellow slider those separate

449
00:22:16,999 --> 00:22:20,375
in reprogramming mode so that they index to one

450
00:22:20,375 --> 00:22:24,792
of the 6 different little teeth on the slider.

451
00:22:24,834 --> 00:22:26,584
And they bring it back together.

452
00:22:26,584 --> 00:22:29,334
That's how the combination is changed in this lock.

453
00:22:29,334 --> 00:22:30,334
Go ahead, Toby.

454
00:22:30,334 --> 00:22:35,542
TOBIAS BLUZMANIS: Same thing, not only one pin/slider combination.

455
00:22:35,542 --> 00:22:43,501
We have in total for the SmartKey, we have 5 pins and 5 sliders.

456
00:22:43,876 --> 00:22:47,334
So the sliders are the ones that set the combination

457
00:22:47,334 --> 00:22:50,709
inside the SmartKey cylinder.

458
00:22:50,751 --> 00:22:54,709
So when you put the key and the key is set to that combination, you see

459
00:22:54,709 --> 00:22:56,501
the red dots?

460
00:22:56,999 --> 00:23:01,959
That's where the side bar drops, okay?

461
00:23:01,959 --> 00:23:03,999
So when the side bar drops at that combination,

462
00:23:03,999 --> 00:23:06,250
that lock can be open.

463
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:10,459
And the pins just follow the combination of the key.

464
00:23:10,792 --> 00:23:19,999
In this case we have 26341 which is the individual depth of each key.

465
00:23:21,792 --> 00:23:28,083
If we want to rekey the lock, we have to put the working key

466
00:23:28,083 --> 00:23:34,918
they have a special cool that it will move a block in that have

467
00:23:34,918 --> 00:23:41,083
a hub that house all those sliders and what happens is that

468
00:23:41,083 --> 00:23:45,918
the sliders separate from the pins.

469
00:23:45,918 --> 00:23:49,667
So now we can remove the pins but the pins the sliders are

470
00:23:49,667 --> 00:23:53,584
at the same shear line with the    MARC WEBER TOBIAS:

471
00:23:53,584 --> 00:23:57,584
They're locked into position so they can't go anywhere

472
00:23:57,584 --> 00:24:00,876
until we stick another key in.

473
00:24:00,876 --> 00:24:03,125
TOBIAS BLUZMANIS: So we can put another key.

474
00:24:03,125 --> 00:24:07,959
That key sets to the combination of the key and then we have to bring

475
00:24:07,959 --> 00:24:14,125
all those sliders back to engage again to the sliders, the pins.

476
00:24:14,167 --> 00:24:19,709
So we have a new key working for this lock.

477
00:24:20,083 --> 00:24:23,459
So it's very clever design.

478
00:24:23,459 --> 00:24:28,292
They have ball bearings to prevent also    MARC WEBER

479
00:24:28,292 --> 00:24:35,542
TOBIAS: Okay, so these are the components that let's see.

480
00:24:35,542 --> 00:24:36,542
Okay.

481
00:24:36,792 --> 00:24:39,125
So this shows the 5 pin tumblers that

482
00:24:39,125 --> 00:24:41,542
the key responds to.

483
00:24:41,542 --> 00:24:44,876
These are locked together to make this lock work.

484
00:24:44,876 --> 00:24:48,167
So and the two bottom pieces are the side bars that actually stop that

485
00:24:48,167 --> 00:24:50,250
plug from turning.

486
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:53,501
And this is what the plug looks like.

487
00:24:53,999 --> 00:24:55,584
TOBIAS BLUZMANIS: Yeah, their pins are, like,

488
00:24:55,584 --> 00:24:58,918
hollow so you can put the pins, they have a cover.

489
00:24:58,999 --> 00:25:04,459
So you see the tabs where the sliders go and you have that hub,

490
00:25:04,459 --> 00:25:09,999
that puts the slider together with the side bar.

491
00:25:09,999 --> 00:25:11,792
MARC WEBER TOBIAS: Okay.

492
00:25:11,792 --> 00:25:13,167
So now let's talk about master key systems

493
00:25:13,167 --> 00:25:15,999
before we get to the attacks.

494
00:25:15,999 --> 00:25:19,501
So in conventional master key systems and pin tumbler locks,

495
00:25:19,501 --> 00:25:23,209
we have one key that can open many locks.

496
00:25:23,209 --> 00:25:27,167
And there's potentially many different levels of keying.

497
00:25:27,167 --> 00:25:30,417
Because we have an extra pin in each chamber.

498
00:25:30,834 --> 00:25:33,999
And that creates a whole bunch of different shear lines.

499
00:25:34,542 --> 00:25:37,792
Conventional locks are expensive to rekey.

500
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:39,375
You have to have a locksmith do it.

501
00:25:39,375 --> 00:25:43,209
And there's also what we call incidental master keys.

502
00:25:43,209 --> 00:25:46,459
A lot of keys that will open a master key cylinder that really

503
00:25:46,459 --> 00:25:48,501
aren't intended.

504
00:25:48,501 --> 00:25:50,792
TOBIAS BLUZMANIS: And that's a problem.

505
00:25:50,792 --> 00:25:52,999
MARC WEBER TOBIAS: And that's a problem.

506
00:25:52,999 --> 00:25:55,167
TOBIAS BLUZMANIS: Well actually, what happened with master key system,

507
00:25:55,167 --> 00:26:01,083
those unintended keys, they tried to use those to work in the system.

508
00:26:01,167 --> 00:26:04,083
So depends on how the people doing the master keys,

509
00:26:04,083 --> 00:26:06,501
you have more than two keys working

510
00:26:06,501 --> 00:26:08,417
on the system.

511
00:26:08,417 --> 00:26:09,250
We're going to show pretty much how

512
00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:11,626
a master key system works.

513
00:26:11,626 --> 00:26:13,999
MARC WEBER TOBIAS: As we pointed out years ago,

514
00:26:13,999 --> 00:26:17,999
if they're not high security, they be also easily compromised

515
00:26:17,999 --> 00:26:22,751
but in a different way so we can figure out what a top level master key

516
00:26:22,751 --> 00:26:24,709
is in a system.

517
00:26:24,709 --> 00:26:28,626
TOBIAS BLUZMANIS: Remember the pin tumbler lock it has top pin,

518
00:26:28,626 --> 00:26:30,375
bottom pin?

519
00:26:30,375 --> 00:26:34,375
Now we have another pin between the top and bottom.

520
00:26:34,501 --> 00:26:39,125
So what happened that we are we are creating two shear lines,

521
00:26:39,125 --> 00:26:45,083
right there we can split the pin and the lock opens, we have one depth

522
00:26:45,083 --> 00:26:47,250
for that pin.

523
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:50,501
But it's also another shear line.

524
00:26:50,501 --> 00:26:56,292
So we have two depths that opens in that specific chamber.

525
00:26:56,292 --> 00:27:00,125
But again if this is not a lock is not one pin, so we

526
00:27:00,125 --> 00:27:04,709
for this example we put another split pin.

527
00:27:04,709 --> 00:27:07,709
We put a master that's called a master waiver.

528
00:27:07,709 --> 00:27:09,876
MARC WEBER TOBIAS: Middle pin.

529
00:27:09,918 --> 00:27:15,125
TOBIAS BLUZMANIS: And the rest will were left the pins like that.

530
00:27:15,999 --> 00:27:21,792
We have an A key that makes the shear line so that key

531
00:27:21,792 --> 00:27:25,125
will open the cylinder.

532
00:27:25,459 --> 00:27:30,375
We also have a B key that will open the cylinder.

533
00:27:30,459 --> 00:27:33,125
So those were the two intended keys when we're

534
00:27:33,125 --> 00:27:36,167
making the master key system.

535
00:27:36,167 --> 00:27:42,834
We have to understand also that when people say they have a master key,

536
00:27:42,834 --> 00:27:48,876
there's no such thing as a master key for a GM car.

537
00:27:48,918 --> 00:27:52,501
You have to set a master key system.

538
00:27:52,501 --> 00:27:58,334
In a pin tumbler lock when somebody said I have a master key, the system

539
00:27:58,334 --> 00:28:02,999
is set to work with this master waivers in order

540
00:28:02,999 --> 00:28:07,999
to set the system to open different locks.

541
00:28:08,999 --> 00:28:13,083
The problem now is that we have two unintended keys,

542
00:28:13,083 --> 00:28:17,834
key C and key B that will also open that lock.

543
00:28:17,834 --> 00:28:22,584
And if we add more master waivers, that number is going to increase

544
00:28:22,584 --> 00:28:25,334
an exponential number.

545
00:28:26,626 --> 00:28:29,999
And, depending on the person doing the job,

546
00:28:29,999 --> 00:28:34,834
they can do even more master waivers and that creates many,

547
00:28:34,834 --> 00:28:39,459
many coincidental keys and they're not secure.

548
00:28:39,459 --> 00:28:42,999
MARC WEBER TOBIAS: And it can also make the lock a lot easier to pick.

549
00:28:42,999 --> 00:28:46,083
TOBIAS BLUZMANIS: The other problem with Kwikset is the key way

550
00:28:46,083 --> 00:28:50,876
is so common and they have so many different individual

551
00:28:50,876 --> 00:28:54,792
keys that they can use that probably your home

552
00:28:54,792 --> 00:28:58,999
key if you have a commercial facility that has been

553
00:28:58,999 --> 00:29:04,083
rekeyed and has a master key system, is that potentially one

554
00:29:04,083 --> 00:29:09,292
of your keys can open one or more of those locks.

555
00:29:09,292 --> 00:29:12,999
MARC WEBER TOBIAS: Kwikset came up with key control.

556
00:29:14,250 --> 00:29:17,876
It's a one level master key system.

557
00:29:17,876 --> 00:29:21,334
There's two cores in one cylinder.

558
00:29:21,667 --> 00:29:26,083
It's actually a clever system for apartment houses where you only

559
00:29:26,083 --> 00:29:29,125
need one level of master keys.

560
00:29:29,125 --> 00:29:36,584
There's two separate key ways that are secure that one won't go into the other.

561
00:29:36,584 --> 00:29:39,918
So the apartment user, the apartment tenant has one key,

562
00:29:39,918 --> 00:29:43,459
their change key and the management has a key that

563
00:29:43,459 --> 00:29:47,083
will open the other core in the lock.

564
00:29:47,626 --> 00:29:49,417
It's actually very clever.

565
00:29:49,417 --> 00:29:51,083
No locksmith is required.

566
00:29:51,083 --> 00:29:53,999
You can instantly change your master key systems.

567
00:29:53,999 --> 00:29:57,375
There are 46,000 theoretical combinations.

568
00:29:57,834 --> 00:29:59,209
They're good for facilities that need

569
00:29:59,209 --> 00:30:01,999
a very limited kind of system.

570
00:30:01,999 --> 00:30:05,999
So actually, it's a very clever system.

571
00:30:05,999 --> 00:30:08,792
However, it's got the same security vulnerabilities

572
00:30:08,792 --> 00:30:11,000
as the single lock.

573
00:30:11,459 --> 00:30:14,042
And again, they can be instantly reprogrammed.

574
00:30:14,417 --> 00:30:18,876
And you do not have cross key problem in the Kwikset that you have

575
00:30:18,876 --> 00:30:22,334
on conventional master key systems.

576
00:30:22,334 --> 00:30:23,834
It doesn't exist.

577
00:30:23,834 --> 00:30:26,501
So the problem is they can also be compromised

578
00:30:26,501 --> 00:30:28,501
in 15 seconds.

579
00:30:28,626 --> 00:30:32,626
So security, what you get is what you pay for.

580
00:30:32,876 --> 00:30:39,083
Does anybody expect a 20 $30 lock, $40 lock to actually be secure?

581
00:30:39,083 --> 00:30:40,417
And that's the question.

582
00:30:40,417 --> 00:30:46,000
And again we understand that a lot of folks can't afford high security locks.

583
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,209
But we also believe that the public has a right

584
00:30:48,209 --> 00:30:52,584
to understand so they can make the decision knowingly and intelligently

585
00:30:52,584 --> 00:30:55,501
whether they'll accept the risk.

586
00:30:55,501 --> 00:31:00,876
So as we say, there's millions of facilities that can be at risk here.

587
00:31:00,959 --> 00:31:03,959
And there's a false sense of security as we talked

588
00:31:03,959 --> 00:31:07,959
about between the BHMA standard that says this is the highest grade

589
00:31:07,959 --> 00:31:12,667
of security for residential and the anti picking, anti bumping.

590
00:31:12,667 --> 00:31:16,999
So we're going to go through and as you heard the tech reps

591
00:31:16,999 --> 00:31:22,626
at Kwikset say, there's no way to get into these locks.

592
00:31:22,834 --> 00:31:24,375
If you don't have the key or you've got to drill them

593
00:31:24,375 --> 00:31:26,083
and destroy them.

594
00:31:26,292 --> 00:31:30,626
So SmartKey and design issues, the problem is the side bar

595
00:31:30,626 --> 00:31:32,876
and the sliders.

596
00:31:32,876 --> 00:31:35,626
There's only one layer of security and our problem

597
00:31:35,626 --> 00:31:40,334
is these little sliders that you see are very fragile.

598
00:31:40,334 --> 00:31:43,626
And there's also maintenance problems and programmability problems

599
00:31:43,626 --> 00:31:46,417
and low tolerance with the lock.

600
00:31:48,083 --> 00:31:51,167
And the real problem, as we're going to show you in a minute,

601
00:31:51,167 --> 00:31:54,751
you can apply torque to these plugs and open them.

602
00:31:54,751 --> 00:31:56,667
So here's the attack methodology that we came

603
00:31:56,667 --> 00:31:58,083
up with.

604
00:31:58,709 --> 00:32:03,083
Try out keys, wired through the key way.

605
00:32:03,083 --> 00:32:06,918
Visually reading the side bar and slider positions.

606
00:32:06,918 --> 00:32:09,501
Torque the plug, replicating key control and decoding

607
00:32:09,501 --> 00:32:11,667
of the master key.

608
00:32:11,667 --> 00:32:14,292
Other than that, they're very, very secure locks.

609
00:32:14,626 --> 00:32:15,959
(Laughter).

610
00:32:16,083 --> 00:32:18,999
Okay, so first of all, try out keys, probably most

611
00:32:18,999 --> 00:32:21,709
of you guys aren't old enough to remember

612
00:32:21,709 --> 00:32:26,459
in the 60s we had 64 keys that would open up all GM cars.

613
00:32:26,459 --> 00:32:27,459
64.

614
00:32:29,459 --> 00:32:32,626
We exploited the tolerance in the locks.

615
00:32:32,709 --> 00:32:35,918
TOBIAS BLUZMANIS: There's no such thing as a master key system

616
00:32:35,918 --> 00:32:37,918
for GM and you said.

617
00:32:37,918 --> 00:32:39,999
MARC WEBER TOBIAS: They're not master keys, they're tryout keys,

618
00:32:39,999 --> 00:32:42,292
you jiggle them in the key way.

619
00:32:42,667 --> 00:32:44,999
Sometimes they would open.

620
00:32:44,999 --> 00:32:45,999
Most of the time.

621
00:32:45,999 --> 00:32:48,999
But what you're doing is cutting the tolerance in half.

622
00:32:48,999 --> 00:32:51,250
Same thing with Kwikset.

623
00:32:51,334 --> 00:32:57,083
Basically with six depths in a Kwikset, most of the time we can make three

624
00:32:57,083 --> 00:32:59,999
depths equal 6 depths.

625
00:32:59,999 --> 00:33:02,501
So here is a graphic.

626
00:33:02,501 --> 00:33:06,375
The six steps on a Kwikset key, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, cuts.

627
00:33:06,542 --> 00:33:16,501
This is a depth increment key of 1, 1 1/2, 2, 2 1/2, 3, 3, 3 1/2 and 6.

628
00:33:16,501 --> 00:33:19,083
TOBIAS BLUZMANIS: We didn't do this.

629
00:33:19,083 --> 00:33:23,584
This is something that we test on the SmartKey.

630
00:33:23,584 --> 00:33:26,125
This is an old type of attack.

631
00:33:26,167 --> 00:33:29,999
Try to split the difference between one cut and the other one.

632
00:33:30,083 --> 00:33:32,584
Because the tolerance is you need tolerances

633
00:33:32,584 --> 00:33:34,834
for this lock to work.

634
00:33:34,834 --> 00:33:36,083
MARC WEBER TOBIAS: Yeah.

635
00:33:36,083 --> 00:33:38,792
So the next problem has always been their problem and it's called

636
00:33:38,792 --> 00:33:40,999
the tail piece design.

637
00:33:40,999 --> 00:33:45,918
And this is the linkage when you insert the key into the plug, the plug has

638
00:33:45,918 --> 00:33:49,125
to talk to the bolt or the latch.

639
00:33:49,125 --> 00:33:52,876
To communicate the energy to withdraw or lock the bold.

640
00:33:52,876 --> 00:33:56,999
So with Kwikset, this is hollow on one side.

641
00:33:57,083 --> 00:34:00,375
It's square and hollow so it will interface on both sides

642
00:34:00,375 --> 00:34:02,626
of the door together.

643
00:34:02,918 --> 00:34:04,542
Through the bolt.

644
00:34:06,999 --> 00:34:09,999
So this is one of the attacks we developed on one

645
00:34:09,999 --> 00:34:12,999
of the older key knob cylinders.

646
00:34:12,999 --> 00:34:16,083
This is a special key we made on the bottom that if we knock

647
00:34:16,083 --> 00:34:19,999
out the piece at the end of the key way, so there's a slot,

648
00:34:19,999 --> 00:34:23,999
we can go right through that and open the lock.

649
00:34:26,083 --> 00:34:29,709
So, if you stick that in literally in five seconds,

650
00:34:29,709 --> 00:34:32,918
this key and knob lock is open.

651
00:34:32,918 --> 00:34:34,501
This is another design.

652
00:34:34,501 --> 00:34:35,501
Toby?

653
00:34:35,501 --> 00:34:37,999
TOBIAS BLUZMANIS: Yeah, this is an old design.

654
00:34:37,999 --> 00:34:41,083
Actually this is a pin tumbler lock.

655
00:34:41,083 --> 00:34:44,626
They share the same configuration.

656
00:34:44,667 --> 00:34:51,792
But the back was covered by like 20,000 of an inch thick brass.

657
00:34:51,792 --> 00:34:56,375
So we're piercing that with an old Kwikset key that you can

658
00:34:56,375 --> 00:35:01,083
get anywhere and we put a piece wire that it was bent

659
00:35:01,083 --> 00:35:04,626
to accommodate the cylinder.

660
00:35:04,999 --> 00:35:07,999
MARC WEBER TOBIAS: This is the newer design.

661
00:35:07,999 --> 00:35:10,083
TOBIAS BLUZMANIS: This is on the Kwikset SmartKey

662
00:35:10,083 --> 00:35:12,999
and we're going to show how easy we can access

663
00:35:12,999 --> 00:35:15,876
the tail piece and pierce    MARC WEBER TOBIAS:

664
00:35:15,876 --> 00:35:18,626
You tell us whether you think this is ah, come

665
00:35:18,626 --> 00:35:21,876
on whether you think this is secure.

666
00:35:22,209 --> 00:35:28,292
This attack on the tail piece of the Kwikset SmartKey

667
00:35:28,292 --> 00:35:33,083
and earlier cylinders is based on the design

668
00:35:33,083 --> 00:35:37,209
of the tail piece by Kwikset.

669
00:35:37,209 --> 00:35:43,792
It's hollow and it's square which allows us to pierce the cap at the end

670
00:35:43,792 --> 00:35:49,542
of the plug and insert a wire that's been formed to catch

671
00:35:49,542 --> 00:35:54,626
the edges of the tail piece and turn it.

672
00:35:54,626 --> 00:35:57,375
TOBIAS BLUZMANIS: Okay, the first thing is to introduce

673
00:35:57,375 --> 00:35:59,999
the tool like a regular key.

674
00:36:00,083 --> 00:36:03,751
I'm going to put tension.

675
00:36:03,876 --> 00:36:07,918
And that tension is going to make this side bar block

676
00:36:07,918 --> 00:36:11,999
the slider so I can remove the tool.

677
00:36:12,292 --> 00:36:17,959
And the reason is I need to put the tool backwards so we can start

678
00:36:17,959 --> 00:36:20,751
piercing from the top.

679
00:36:20,751 --> 00:36:22,125
That's the complicated part.

680
00:36:22,125 --> 00:36:23,626
MARC WEBER TOBIAS: Yeah.

681
00:36:23,999 --> 00:36:26,292
It's just a sharp piece of metal.

682
00:36:26,542 --> 00:36:28,417
Yeah, that's the complicated part.

683
00:36:29,167 --> 00:36:31,584
Now it's a matter of breaking it.

684
00:36:31,584 --> 00:36:34,209
TOBIAS BLUZMANIS: You can see the back on one side.

685
00:36:38,167 --> 00:36:40,083
(Smack smack smack smack smack).

686
00:36:40,083 --> 00:36:41,834
MARC WEBER TOBIAS: That's it.

687
00:36:42,667 --> 00:36:46,209
TOBIAS BLUZMANIS: This is a complicated part.

688
00:36:46,209 --> 00:36:49,417
MARC WEBER TOBIAS: Yeah, you've got to use the pliers, yeah.

689
00:36:50,709 --> 00:36:52,918
That's why I let him do it.

690
00:36:54,999 --> 00:36:59,209
TOBIAS BLUZMANIS: Now we have an opening

691
00:36:59,209 --> 00:37:03,792
for wire now we can access the tail piece that

692
00:37:03,792 --> 00:37:08,250
is right here you see I'm moving the keep going

693
00:37:08,250 --> 00:37:12,792
because    MARC WEBER TOBIAS: Yeah.

694
00:37:12,792 --> 00:37:13,792
And that's it.

695
00:37:13,792 --> 00:37:14,999
That will open the lock.

696
00:37:15,626 --> 00:37:23,167
(Applause)    TOBIAS BLUZMANIS: So that's it.

697
00:37:24,999 --> 00:37:25,999
(Laughter).

698
00:37:25,999 --> 00:37:27,999
There's no damage to the lock.

699
00:37:28,083 --> 00:37:30,083
Your key still works.

700
00:37:30,083 --> 00:37:37,999
MARC WEBER TOBIAS: So how many of you still trust your door locks?

701
00:37:38,751 --> 00:37:41,999
Next one: Visual decoding.

702
00:37:41,999 --> 00:37:46,501
We didn't show this but we'll tell you, you can actually take a little mirror,

703
00:37:46,501 --> 00:37:50,999
insert it into the lock, it takes a little more talent.

704
00:37:50,999 --> 00:37:54,542
And you can read the position of each of the sliders.

705
00:37:54,584 --> 00:37:55,584
Okay.

706
00:37:55,584 --> 00:37:57,125
Here's the really good one.

707
00:37:57,125 --> 00:38:00,999
This is, as I told Toby, let's just label the slide "torque'd off."

708
00:38:01,375 --> 00:38:03,999
So this is torquing the plug.

709
00:38:04,709 --> 00:38:07,250
We actually filed a complaint with the Builders Hardware

710
00:38:07,250 --> 00:38:10,501
Manufacturer's Association a couple years ago.

711
00:38:10,501 --> 00:38:11,999
It was essentially ignored.

712
00:38:11,999 --> 00:38:16,459
That we didn't think this lock should be certified as a grade 1 lock.

713
00:38:16,459 --> 00:38:20,375
This is the entire security of this lock as far we're concerned.

714
00:38:20,375 --> 00:38:23,542
These are sliders as you saw on the diagrams.

715
00:38:23,542 --> 00:38:25,125
The one on the left is normal.

716
00:38:25,125 --> 00:38:27,709
The one on the right has been warped.

717
00:38:27,709 --> 00:38:29,999
You can see it's not straight.

718
00:38:30,209 --> 00:38:34,542
This is also what happens when you stick a screwdriver into the lock.

719
00:38:34,999 --> 00:38:36,501
It's warped.

720
00:38:36,501 --> 00:38:37,999
The geometry changes.

721
00:38:38,584 --> 00:38:42,209
TOBIAS BLUZMANIS: The lock is going to be as secure

722
00:38:42,209 --> 00:38:47,501
as its weakest link and if the material is not as strong enough, that that's

723
00:38:47,501 --> 00:38:49,459
the end of it.

724
00:38:49,459 --> 00:38:52,292
MARC WEBER TOBIAS: We also ran some tests and we were able

725
00:38:52,292 --> 00:38:56,167
to torque this lock at 112 pound force inches.

726
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:59,417
The standard actually requires 300 but their argument was well, yeah,

727
00:38:59,417 --> 00:39:03,876
but you're either sticking a paperclip or a piece of key a broken off piece

728
00:39:03,876 --> 00:39:06,125
of key into the key way.

729
00:39:06,125 --> 00:39:09,751
TOBIAS BLUZMANIS: There is one element    MARC WEBER

730
00:39:09,751 --> 00:39:12,083
TOBIAS: 7 minutes.

731
00:39:12,083 --> 00:39:14,792
TOBIAS BLUZMANIS: There's one element that

732
00:39:14,792 --> 00:39:20,626
on the cylinder that when we torque the plug, we had to introduce a piece

733
00:39:20,626 --> 00:39:22,584
of key wire.

734
00:39:22,584 --> 00:39:27,959
Because we need to lift that slider that is blocking

735
00:39:27,959 --> 00:39:33,999
to the housing because there's three different depths,

736
00:39:33,999 --> 00:39:41,125
depth 1, depth 2, depth 3 that it will block the physical slider

737
00:39:41,125 --> 00:39:46,375
will block the rotation for that pin.

738
00:39:46,375 --> 00:39:48,999
But there isn't a specific position.

739
00:39:48,999 --> 00:39:52,542
And doesn't matter depth is set the slider.

740
00:39:52,542 --> 00:39:56,709
The slider is going to get inside the plug.

741
00:39:56,709 --> 00:40:07,667
So the only prevent element preventing the cylinder for opening is the slider.

742
00:40:07,667 --> 00:40:09,999
MARC WEBER TOBIAS: So here's what happens.

743
00:40:11,542 --> 00:40:14,209
(Audio) SmartKey.

744
00:40:14,792 --> 00:40:17,542
TOBIAS BLUZMANIS: That's the SmartKey.

745
00:40:17,918 --> 00:40:21,584
We just need to that is specific height.

746
00:40:21,751 --> 00:40:23,999
We're using a piece of paperclip.

747
00:40:27,709 --> 00:40:31,584
We just    MARC WEBER TOBIAS: That's also the complicated part.

748
00:40:31,918 --> 00:40:34,999
TOBIAS BLUZMANIS: And of course I did that part.

749
00:40:36,999 --> 00:40:38,250
(Laughter).

750
00:40:38,250 --> 00:40:39,709
MARC WEBER TOBIAS: Yeah.

751
00:40:39,709 --> 00:40:42,999
(Chuckling) so this is just a standard little screwdriver.

752
00:40:42,999 --> 00:40:45,000
We just seat it into the key way.

753
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,542
You don't have to bang on it.

754
00:40:46,542 --> 00:40:48,542
This is a vice grip.

755
00:40:48,542 --> 00:40:51,125
This door on your house.

756
00:40:52,959 --> 00:40:54,667
You see it's already turned.

757
00:40:54,667 --> 00:40:57,792
TOBIAS BLUZMANIS: You can see it's already turned.

758
00:41:01,375 --> 00:41:06,501
TOBIAS BLUZMANIS: Those sliders bend, the plug compresses.

759
00:41:06,501 --> 00:41:09,167
So now the cylinder can go back and forth.

760
00:41:12,125 --> 00:41:15,417
Now you have to put that piece there.

761
00:41:15,999 --> 00:41:18,959
And that's the reason why they passed the test.

762
00:41:18,999 --> 00:41:20,999
To certification.

763
00:41:21,459 --> 00:41:24,876
Because when they test for this lock, they put the screwdriver,

764
00:41:24,876 --> 00:41:28,918
they torque it to say but the cylinder is open right now.

765
00:41:28,918 --> 00:41:30,999
MARC WEBER TOBIAS: Okay.

766
00:41:30,999 --> 00:41:34,459
Same problem, no key control plastic keys.

767
00:41:34,918 --> 00:41:36,083
Okay?

768
00:41:36,542 --> 00:41:38,250
This is very impressive.

769
00:41:42,125 --> 00:41:52,876
TOBIAS BLUZMANIS: That's a MasterCard.

770
00:41:52,876 --> 00:41:54,918
MARC WEBER TOBIAS: No, that's Chase.

771
00:41:54,918 --> 00:41:55,918
(Laughter).

772
00:41:55,918 --> 00:41:57,999
TOBIAS BLUZMANIS: Sorry, I didn't know.

773
00:41:57,999 --> 00:42:01,709
MARC WEBER TOBIAS: So then we figured out how to decode the lock.

774
00:42:01,709 --> 00:42:03,083
We're going to run out of time.

775
00:42:03,876 --> 00:42:07,999
Basically there's a procedure that we can take six

776
00:42:07,999 --> 00:42:12,999
different keys and we can figure out    TOBIAS BLUZMANIS: How

777
00:42:12,999 --> 00:42:14,999
to decode it.

778
00:42:14,999 --> 00:42:18,667
Those are the depths of each pin.

779
00:42:18,667 --> 00:42:24,626
But now, if we notice, that side bar really doesn't did not

780
00:42:24,626 --> 00:42:28,459
engage on the false gate.

781
00:42:28,459 --> 00:42:33,250
So we designed one key that can move basically what we're going

782
00:42:33,250 --> 00:42:37,542
to you're going to see here in this video is that

783
00:42:37,542 --> 00:42:41,083
if we can remove the key from the cylinder

784
00:42:41,083 --> 00:42:45,999
with a specific depth that is an indication that we have

785
00:42:45,999 --> 00:42:50,999
the code    MARC WEBER TOBIAS: I don't think we have time

786
00:42:50,999 --> 00:42:53,459
to run this video.

787
00:42:53,459 --> 00:42:57,334
But these are the six keys let me just do part of this.

788
00:42:57,834 --> 00:43:03,542
Video: This is going to be decoding the cylinder on Kwikset.

789
00:43:03,542 --> 00:43:05,999
This is the problem with master key.

790
00:43:06,584 --> 00:43:12,999
We have depth probing keys for each of the 6th depths that we're

791
00:43:12,999 --> 00:43:18,876
going to probe in rapid order and determine the essentially

792
00:43:18,876 --> 00:43:23,999
the gate positions on each of the sliders.

793
00:43:24,584 --> 00:43:28,501
TOBIAS BLUZMANIS: So let's start with number 6.

794
00:43:28,501 --> 00:43:29,999
Just put the key in.

795
00:43:29,999 --> 00:43:34,083
Put a little bit of torque and try to remove the key.

796
00:43:34,459 --> 00:43:37,709
TOBIAS BLUZMANIS: If we cannot remove the key, that's

797
00:43:37,709 --> 00:43:42,167
an indication that that pin is not set for that depth.

798
00:43:42,417 --> 00:43:46,999
MARC WEBER TOBIAS: Basically we go through and probe each

799
00:43:46,999 --> 00:43:52,250
of the six sliders and then once we figure out the code, we generate

800
00:43:52,250 --> 00:43:55,999
a key for it in, like, 10 seconds.

801
00:43:55,999 --> 00:44:00,626
TOBIAS BLUZMANIS: So we go pin by pin.

802
00:44:00,626 --> 00:44:01,626
Pin.

803
00:44:01,626 --> 00:44:03,375
We just put the key in that position.

804
00:44:03,375 --> 00:44:04,375
We try to remove.

805
00:44:04,375 --> 00:44:07,083
If it can be removed, we record the number that we're using

806
00:44:07,083 --> 00:44:10,999
to    MARC WEBER TOBIAS: So basically, Toby goes through,

807
00:44:10,999 --> 00:44:15,167
decodes the entire lock, creates a key for it.

808
00:44:15,167 --> 00:44:19,125
So making the control as we'll wrap this up, this

809
00:44:19,125 --> 00:44:22,792
is their master key scheme.

810
00:44:22,792 --> 00:44:26,292
TOBIAS BLUZMANIS: Yeah, this is the way that Kwikset takes

811
00:44:26,292 --> 00:44:30,167
the approach for the master key system.

812
00:44:30,792 --> 00:44:33,876
This is what they call the key control.

813
00:44:33,876 --> 00:44:40,125
MARC WEBER TOBIAS: It's not playing.

814
00:44:40,250 --> 00:44:41,834
Go ahead.

815
00:44:41,834 --> 00:44:45,792
TOBIAS BLUZMANIS: So that cylinder has another cylinder on top.

816
00:44:45,999 --> 00:44:47,876
That's the scheme they use.

817
00:44:47,876 --> 00:44:52,751
It's two cylinders because their platform is so small

818
00:44:52,751 --> 00:44:58,459
they decided I can have one key for a renters.

819
00:44:58,584 --> 00:45:00,626
One key for the user.

820
00:45:00,626 --> 00:45:05,999
The thing is they're so close and all this attack also can be performed

821
00:45:05,999 --> 00:45:08,501
on the their lock.

822
00:45:08,501 --> 00:45:11,083
That we thought well, this is not secure.

823
00:45:11,083 --> 00:45:12,918
It's even more insecure because you don't see

824
00:45:12,918 --> 00:45:14,999
the cylinder on top.

825
00:45:15,792 --> 00:45:18,792
The cover has to turn so you can expose

826
00:45:18,792 --> 00:45:21,125
the other cylinder.

827
00:45:21,125 --> 00:45:25,709
So, if torque the plug or you pierce the plug, you're never going to notice.

828
00:45:25,709 --> 00:45:28,999
And that's something that you, as consumer, should know that

829
00:45:28,999 --> 00:45:34,459
the    MARC WEBER TOBIAS: Here's the bottom line as we'll sum up.

830
00:45:34,459 --> 00:45:40,999
This is a clever in some respects but also insecure in some respects.

831
00:45:41,375 --> 00:45:43,417
It's a trade I don't have.

832
00:45:43,459 --> 00:45:47,209
When you spend money on locks, it's an insurance policy.

833
00:45:47,709 --> 00:45:50,834
You do get what you pay for.

834
00:45:50,834 --> 00:45:55,792
It may look secure but that, as we've shown you doesn't mean it is.

835
00:45:55,792 --> 00:45:58,626
I think that wraps it up for this DEF CON this year.

836
00:45:58,626 --> 00:45:59,918
We thank you very much for coming and we hope you

837
00:45:59,918 --> 00:46:01,334
enjoyed this.

838
00:46:01,334 --> 00:46:01,334
(Applause.)    TOBIAS BLUZMANIS: If you have any questions    MARC

839
00:46:01,334 --> 00:46:02,667
WEBER TOBIAS: Thank you.
