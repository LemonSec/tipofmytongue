1
00:00:00,042 --> 00:00:03,292
Our next talk up is UFO's and U.S.

2
00:00:03,292 --> 00:00:05,417
Government, so let's give him a big hand.

3
00:00:10,292 --> 00:00:14,751
RICHARD THIEME: Okay.

4
00:00:14,999 --> 00:00:17,667
18 years of DEF CON.

5
00:00:17,667 --> 00:00:19,375
It is a long time.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,209
And you are suppose to do the politician thing like oh, hi, Mark.

7
00:00:26,584 --> 00:00:28,375
No babies here.

8
00:00:28,375 --> 00:00:29,501
They're DEF CON kids.

9
00:00:29,751 --> 00:00:33,709
This talk is going to be tweaked for the DEF CON context

10
00:00:33,709 --> 00:00:37,834
because I want it to be not only what it is.

11
00:00:37,834 --> 00:00:40,709
And I am completely out of the closet now

12
00:00:40,709 --> 00:00:43,959
on the subject of Ufology.

13
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:47,083
You had to be careful along the way.

14
00:00:47,584 --> 00:00:51,999
There was once a reporter columnist for the "Washington Post" who called

15
00:00:51,999 --> 00:00:56,751
me up and said, what are the companies you have worked for?

16
00:00:56,751 --> 00:00:57,999
I love reading your stuff.

17
00:00:57,999 --> 00:00:59,834
I told him some of the bigger names.

18
00:00:59,834 --> 00:01:01,125
You know, the ones you float.

19
00:01:01,125 --> 00:01:03,292
Then the column appeared and it was really kind

20
00:01:03,292 --> 00:01:06,792
of about how crazy can you be before companies like this

21
00:01:06,792 --> 00:01:08,999
will stop hiring you.

22
00:01:09,417 --> 00:01:13,417
(Laughter) This could have a powerful impact on your career

23
00:01:13,417 --> 00:01:19,334
and your life when all you have is your word and your reputation.

24
00:01:19,834 --> 00:01:22,792
So I met him in Washington, we had lunch.

25
00:01:22,999 --> 00:01:25,999
And we discussed the implications of that.

26
00:01:26,083 --> 00:01:30,125
He had gone over the line a little bit by misinterpreting something I wrote

27
00:01:30,125 --> 00:01:33,959
about Ufology and about a friend at NSA who I quoted directly

28
00:01:33,959 --> 00:01:37,501
without approving what he said is accurate.

29
00:01:37,501 --> 00:01:38,999
He said, they're here.

30
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:40,999
They're here.

31
00:01:40,999 --> 00:01:44,876
Now our task, he said, is to figure out how they got here.

32
00:01:44,876 --> 00:01:46,375
And then he starts speculating.

33
00:01:46,375 --> 00:01:48,083
And I said these are speculations.

34
00:01:48,083 --> 00:01:51,375
And that's what was reported as if I had said it was fact.

35
00:01:51,876 --> 00:01:53,083
We don't know.

36
00:01:53,083 --> 00:01:54,999
We don't even know what "they" means.

37
00:01:54,999 --> 00:01:55,501
And this book, UFO's

38
00:01:55,501 --> 00:02:00,167
and Government: A Historical Inquiry, is not primarily about aliens

39
00:02:00,167 --> 00:02:05,584
or crop circles or abductions or any of the craziness that you have blended,

40
00:02:05,584 --> 00:02:09,999
truth, half truth and flat out lies on cable TV.

41
00:02:09,999 --> 00:02:14,751
And the whole UFO domain of myth and mythology.

42
00:02:15,083 --> 00:02:18,083
What it's about primarily is the second word government.

43
00:02:18,584 --> 00:02:20,876
It's about how the government responded

44
00:02:20,876 --> 00:02:23,999
to a phenomena which compelled them to respond

45
00:02:23,999 --> 00:02:28,626
by its intellectable manifestation in their faces and the reports

46
00:02:28,626 --> 00:02:32,292
from credible people beginning in World War II, which

47
00:02:32,292 --> 00:02:35,999
is when we kind of mark the modern era.

48
00:02:35,999 --> 00:02:38,459
Because there had been reports many years prior to that and

49
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:42,083
in the last century that sound suspiciously like UFO reports did

50
00:02:42,083 --> 00:02:45,999
in the middle of the Twentieth Century and forward.

51
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:50,792
But we could no longer ignore them because the military imperative

52
00:02:50,792 --> 00:02:53,959
and I was trying to show in an brief way

53
00:02:53,959 --> 00:02:58,999
the national security concerns that the phenomena raised for them

54
00:02:58,999 --> 00:03:03,250
after World War II when the national security state was

55
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:06,083
in fact just beginning.

56
00:03:06,083 --> 00:03:09,834
The OSS migrating into the CIA and many other instantiations and

57
00:03:09,834 --> 00:03:12,459
the kind of world in which we live, which

58
00:03:12,459 --> 00:03:16,083
is now get some publicity because of the Snowden affair,

59
00:03:16,083 --> 00:03:20,999
as we call it, is the world that was really beginning then.

60
00:03:20,999 --> 00:03:24,083
And how the government responded to the phenomena set policies,

61
00:03:24,083 --> 00:03:29,250
deliberated, argued, competed within its many different parts.

62
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:31,083
Because there's no one government.

63
00:03:31,083 --> 00:03:34,125
There was CIA and there was Navy and there was Airforce and there was

64
00:03:34,125 --> 00:03:37,334
the Executive Branch and the White House, and all kinds

65
00:03:37,334 --> 00:03:41,876
of competing points of views trying to deal with this thing which challenged

66
00:03:41,876 --> 00:03:46,876
people in a complex and puzzling way and above all would not go away.

67
00:03:46,876 --> 00:03:48,375
So they had to respond.

68
00:03:48,375 --> 00:03:50,667
And the way they would choose to respond, you

69
00:03:50,667 --> 00:03:55,417
will see even though I could only hit the highlights because our book

70
00:03:55,417 --> 00:04:00,083
is 600 pages and it has nearly 1,000 citations in it.

71
00:04:00,083 --> 00:04:02,083
It is the only book on the subject recommended

72
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:06,834
by the journal CHOICE which does that for all academic and university libraries

73
00:04:06,834 --> 00:04:10,167
because it is an exception to the dreary field which is not

74
00:04:10,167 --> 00:04:13,083
as painstaking, as rigorous, as academically solid

75
00:04:13,083 --> 00:04:17,501
as this team effort was, which took five years to create.

76
00:04:17,501 --> 00:04:19,542
I'll say a little bit more about that.

77
00:04:19,584 --> 00:04:23,999
You will see what was said about the phenomena was very similar

78
00:04:23,999 --> 00:04:27,667
to what Clapper said to congress a few weeks ago

79
00:04:27,667 --> 00:04:32,125
under questioning when asked if we vacuumed up or collected

80
00:04:32,125 --> 00:04:36,459
the communications of the American people.

81
00:04:36,542 --> 00:04:38,334
And he said, no.

82
00:04:38,334 --> 00:04:43,292
And, when he was accused of lying, he did not admit that he had lied.

83
00:04:43,292 --> 00:04:45,667
He said that he had told the least untruthful thing

84
00:04:45,667 --> 00:04:48,083
he could say in public.

85
00:04:49,999 --> 00:04:52,999
(Laughter) That's what happens to the weasel words

86
00:04:52,999 --> 00:04:56,083
of the English language as they are used and misused

87
00:04:56,083 --> 00:05:00,501
and intentionally used for deception and disinformation.

88
00:05:00,501 --> 00:05:01,501
The fact is he lied.

89
00:05:01,834 --> 00:05:04,751
By normal human standards, those of us who live out here,

90
00:05:04,751 --> 00:05:08,501
we outsiders out here some of you are insiders so you know more

91
00:05:08,501 --> 00:05:11,792
intimately what I mean, but you can't say that you do,

92
00:05:11,792 --> 00:05:15,083
so you will act like outsiders out here for the purposes

93
00:05:15,083 --> 00:05:17,250
of this talk, right?

94
00:05:17,626 --> 00:05:20,250
So let's get to it.

95
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:21,999
First of all, I want to acknowledge too that DEF CON has

96
00:05:21,999 --> 00:05:25,584
shifted in the 18 years I've been coming and speaking here.

97
00:05:25,834 --> 00:05:28,417
There were a few hundred the first time.

98
00:05:28,417 --> 00:05:32,083
There are, I don't know 14, 15,000 probably this time.

99
00:05:32,083 --> 00:05:33,918
But what I noticed I asked the other packed room: How many are

100
00:05:33,918 --> 00:05:35,959
here for the first time?

101
00:05:35,959 --> 00:05:37,626
An awful lot of hands went up.

102
00:05:37,626 --> 00:05:40,375
How many here more than five years?

103
00:05:40,751 --> 00:05:41,999
Not very many.

104
00:05:41,999 --> 00:05:46,167
That means the context that I take for granted because I am a silverback.

105
00:05:46,167 --> 00:05:47,626
I can't hide that either.

106
00:05:47,792 --> 00:05:50,209
I'm out of the closet as a deranged old man wandering

107
00:05:50,209 --> 00:05:53,083
around the CON as somebody tweeted just two years

108
00:05:53,083 --> 00:05:55,667
ago during one of my talks.

109
00:05:58,292 --> 00:06:01,667
(Laughter) But he did add, nevertheless, he's still belting

110
00:06:01,667 --> 00:06:04,083
out some pretty heavy ideas.

111
00:06:04,083 --> 00:06:05,999
Which I appreciated despite the dementia which was

112
00:06:05,999 --> 00:06:08,250
obviously in evidence.

113
00:06:08,834 --> 00:06:12,999
The part of the brain that was functional was still somehow able to ideate,

114
00:06:12,999 --> 00:06:15,792
and I thanked him for that.

115
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:16,999
But it is the marker.

116
00:06:16,999 --> 00:06:18,083
Two years after they started here a reporter

117
00:06:18,083 --> 00:06:21,834
in England said I was a father figure for online culture.

118
00:06:21,834 --> 00:06:22,999
Ten years later a hacker said change that

119
00:06:22,999 --> 00:06:24,918
to grandfather.

120
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:27,959
Then ten years later I'm a deranged old man.

121
00:06:28,751 --> 00:06:33,667
Those who find that amusing, that will be your destiny as well.

122
00:06:33,667 --> 00:06:36,918
I just warn you in advance those dots

123
00:06:36,918 --> 00:06:40,792
will also connect for you.

124
00:06:41,083 --> 00:06:42,083
Okay.

125
00:06:42,083 --> 00:06:43,999
So let me establish the context.

126
00:06:43,999 --> 00:06:47,459
I use to refer to books then I found out nobody read them anymore.

127
00:06:47,459 --> 00:06:48,999
So I started going to movies.

128
00:06:48,999 --> 00:06:52,209
When I referred to HAL and a hacker said "Who is HAL?"

129
00:06:52,209 --> 00:06:55,626
I realized I couldn't even use "2001."

130
00:06:55,626 --> 00:06:59,417
That's a movie by Stanley Kubrick as a point of reference.

131
00:07:00,709 --> 00:07:03,999
When I was driving a young man over here from a hotel I asked him how

132
00:07:03,999 --> 00:07:05,834
he liked Vegas.

133
00:07:05,834 --> 00:07:06,999
And it was his first trip.

134
00:07:06,999 --> 00:07:09,167
And he said, I don't know how Vegas got here.

135
00:07:09,334 --> 00:07:11,667
How did this town get built?

136
00:07:11,667 --> 00:07:14,667
I said, do you not know anything about the history of Vegas?

137
00:07:14,667 --> 00:07:15,751
And he said, no.

138
00:07:15,751 --> 00:07:17,375
So all I could think of was movies.

139
00:07:17,375 --> 00:07:18,999
See "Bugsy," "Casino."

140
00:07:18,999 --> 00:07:21,999
Then read Kitty Kelly's biography of Frank Sinatra and you got

141
00:07:21,999 --> 00:07:23,959
the whole thing.

142
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:25,918
But see "Casino."

143
00:07:25,918 --> 00:07:28,709
Only the names have been changed to protect the guilty.

144
00:07:29,209 --> 00:07:32,209
In this talk see "Chinatown."

145
00:07:32,626 --> 00:07:35,999
If you don't know the great flowering of golden Hollywood movies

146
00:07:35,999 --> 00:07:38,834
in 1970 look it up on Wikipedia.

147
00:07:38,876 --> 00:07:40,959
It will be mostly accurate.

148
00:07:41,292 --> 00:07:45,250
And one of the movies that will be celebrated is "Chinatown."

149
00:07:45,459 --> 00:07:47,959
Robert Towne's great onus.

150
00:07:47,959 --> 00:07:50,292
Look at how the end they wanted to change it.

151
00:07:50,292 --> 00:07:52,626
It was rejected because it was not real.

152
00:07:52,751 --> 00:07:56,999
A Chinatown moment is that kind of moment that you have when you

153
00:07:56,999 --> 00:08:00,999
realize, has that package been inspected?

154
00:08:06,584 --> 00:08:16,250
(Laughter)    AUDIENCE MEMBER: (No microphone.) (Applause)    RICHARD

155
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:24,501
THIEME: At my age it goes too quickly to the brain.

156
00:08:24,501 --> 00:08:25,501
I better not.

157
00:08:26,792 --> 00:08:28,999
But thank you for offering.

158
00:08:28,999 --> 00:08:29,999
Appreciate it.

159
00:08:32,459 --> 00:08:34,751
Okay let's get into the talk.

160
00:08:34,751 --> 00:08:36,334
China town moments are moments when you realize things are not what

161
00:08:36,334 --> 00:08:37,834
they seem.

162
00:08:37,876 --> 00:08:41,083
They really are not what you thought they were.

163
00:08:41,667 --> 00:08:44,083
You may think you know what you are dealing with, Mr. Gidious said,

164
00:08:44,083 --> 00:08:48,083
know across the embodiness of evil, but believe me, sir you don't.

165
00:08:48,375 --> 00:08:51,083
There are moments and this is the silverback part,

166
00:08:51,083 --> 00:08:54,167
as I have aged where you wander into those zones of shadow

167
00:08:54,167 --> 00:08:56,999
and annihilation of the belief system you have built

168
00:08:56,999 --> 00:09:01,334
which is a more optimistic one about how things actually work.

169
00:09:01,876 --> 00:09:05,250
That, for example, Snowden sacrifice of his life as it will turn

170
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:07,375
out to be perhaps.

171
00:09:07,375 --> 00:09:08,709
I mean, he will be killed.

172
00:09:08,709 --> 00:09:10,083
You don't need to kill people.

173
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:12,876
My good friend Gary Webb took his own life with his reputation,

174
00:09:12,876 --> 00:09:16,584
credibility and career were destroyed when he wrote an article

175
00:09:16,584 --> 00:09:21,292
about the CIA contra and crack cocaine that was in the main 98 percent correct,

176
00:09:21,292 --> 00:09:24,459
but which he was forced to retract.

177
00:09:24,459 --> 00:09:25,999
That is his editor retracted it and he was fired A.

178
00:09:25,999 --> 00:09:28,626
Pulitzer prize winning reporter.

179
00:09:28,626 --> 00:09:31,709
Ten years later the word was, of course, we did a lot of that.

180
00:09:31,751 --> 00:09:33,167
Because the longer you get from the deed,

181
00:09:33,167 --> 00:09:35,959
the less accountability there is.

182
00:09:35,959 --> 00:09:37,542
So congress will adjourn.

183
00:09:37,542 --> 00:09:38,918
There can be headlines today and congress

184
00:09:38,918 --> 00:09:42,250
will adjourn and they'll come back in five or six weeks and there

185
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:44,792
will be some other issue on the burner and not

186
00:09:44,792 --> 00:09:47,083
all that much will change.

187
00:09:47,083 --> 00:09:49,125
People in power just wait it out.

188
00:09:49,542 --> 00:09:51,334
Just wait it out.

189
00:09:51,334 --> 00:09:53,792
And freedom of speech is a bleeder valve to enable us

190
00:09:53,792 --> 00:09:56,709
to believe that we are having an effective response

191
00:09:56,709 --> 00:09:59,542
to the things that so perplex us.

192
00:09:59,542 --> 00:10:03,042
But when that speech becomes actionable, that's when you better look

193
00:10:03,042 --> 00:10:07,709
out, that's when you become a whistle blower or a traitor.

194
00:10:07,876 --> 00:10:09,000
All right.

195
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,459
That's relevant as the context in which this deception

196
00:10:11,459 --> 00:10:14,709
and disinformation project took place.

197
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:18,292
UFO's in Government is above all a historical inquiry.

198
00:10:18,292 --> 00:10:19,999
It is a work of history.

199
00:10:19,999 --> 00:10:21,292
It looks at how the government responded

200
00:10:21,292 --> 00:10:23,667
from the 1940s forward.

201
00:10:23,792 --> 00:10:26,375
Michael Sorens was the lead writer.

202
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:29,375
Michael is a brilliant man who has been writing really good scholarship

203
00:10:29,375 --> 00:10:31,375
about this suspect.

204
00:10:31,375 --> 00:10:34,250
A professor at Western University, a PhD in the history

205
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:36,999
of technology and science.

206
00:10:36,999 --> 00:10:42,999
He's written great quality articles to show it is respectable in this field.

207
00:10:44,834 --> 00:10:48,999
I was invited to join this project I think by a wing and a prayer.

208
00:10:48,999 --> 00:10:51,999
Details don't matter, but I found myself in the group.

209
00:10:51,999 --> 00:10:53,501
The thought it was going to plan some white papers

210
00:10:53,501 --> 00:10:56,000
and wound up planning this entire book.

211
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,501
And it took five years to put the book together.

212
00:10:58,501 --> 00:11:02,876
After we met, we didn't meet again until the book was complete.

213
00:11:02,876 --> 00:11:04,459
It was all done over the internet.

214
00:11:04,459 --> 00:11:05,999
Chapters would go to and fro.

215
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:08,751
There's no chapter allowed to this one or that one.

216
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:13,876
We all participated in the creation of the 600 page historical record.

217
00:11:13,876 --> 00:11:17,999
The top three names you see Clas, Vicente and Bill are experts

218
00:11:17,999 --> 00:11:23,292
in their countries Sweden and Spain, pioneered in the use of freedom

219
00:11:23,292 --> 00:11:25,999
of information act to get documents

220
00:11:25,999 --> 00:11:29,709
from the government they claimed did not exist

221
00:11:29,709 --> 00:11:32,167
and which did exist.

222
00:11:32,167 --> 00:11:34,250
He did that in the 70s when he had a chance he knew

223
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:38,334
in 1980 when Reagan was elected that was the end of FOIA.

224
00:11:38,334 --> 00:11:39,751
As it is.

225
00:11:39,751 --> 00:11:41,792
I've had friends both at FBI and Interpol tell me you are never

226
00:11:41,792 --> 00:11:43,999
going to get what you request because we file it

227
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:47,417
under different names and other file folders so we can tell you honestly

228
00:11:47,417 --> 00:11:50,125
there's nothing in that file because it's cross referenced

229
00:11:50,125 --> 00:11:52,209
under different codes.

230
00:11:52,292 --> 00:11:54,834
So it's not going work the same way anymore.

231
00:11:54,834 --> 00:11:56,083
And you will be charged, what, ten bucks a page

232
00:11:56,083 --> 00:11:58,250
to duplicate 8,000 pages.

233
00:11:58,834 --> 00:12:03,083
I was included by sheer good fortune.

234
00:12:03,083 --> 00:12:06,125
Jan Aldrich, the head of projects 1947, which you can find on the web

235
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:08,959
with a lot of documentation.

236
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:10,626
A former intelligence man.

237
00:12:10,999 --> 00:12:14,125
When you look at the book there will be a signing.

238
00:12:14,125 --> 00:12:16,999
I will just say that afterwards at the vendors thing.

239
00:12:16,999 --> 00:12:22,999
But the book is available in print or as a PDF file from Google books.

240
00:12:22,999 --> 00:12:25,959
But not for pads or kindles.

241
00:12:25,959 --> 00:12:27,250
Jan kept us honest.

242
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:28,417
We were drawing all the organizational charts

243
00:12:28,417 --> 00:12:31,167
and communication systems because he would say this one don't

244
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:33,999
talk to that one he talks to that one.

245
00:12:33,999 --> 00:12:37,209
So we had it all documented and correct.

246
00:12:37,209 --> 00:12:38,999
Steve arranged for a million permissions

247
00:12:38,999 --> 00:12:43,459
and didn't include the pictures for which we couldn't.

248
00:12:43,459 --> 00:12:46,125
It's full of photographs of people and things.

249
00:12:46,125 --> 00:12:47,959
So that's what the book is.

250
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:49,292
We're proud of it.

251
00:12:49,292 --> 00:12:50,292
We're proud of it.

252
00:12:50,292 --> 00:12:52,999
I can speak with such pride because it was everybody else's work

253
00:12:52,999 --> 00:12:56,250
that made it such a splendid achievement.

254
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:58,501
First let's start with what a UFO is not.

255
00:12:58,542 --> 00:13:01,709
Tabloid UFO fires on Louisville, Kentucky police chopper,

256
00:13:01,709 --> 00:13:03,626
two cops survive.

257
00:13:03,709 --> 00:13:06,876
That is not what we mean by the word UFO.

258
00:13:06,999 --> 00:13:08,999
People project what they think we mean as aliens

259
00:13:08,999 --> 00:13:10,918
and this and that.

260
00:13:10,918 --> 00:13:11,999
That's not what we mean.

261
00:13:11,999 --> 00:13:13,999
We mean unidentified flying object.

262
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:16,501
But to our knowledge they did not fire on Louisville,

263
00:13:16,501 --> 00:13:18,834
Kentucky police choppers.

264
00:13:18,999 --> 00:13:22,083
And to our knowledge as this man claims space aliens drained

265
00:13:22,083 --> 00:13:25,834
my blood and filled my blood with a fluid.

266
00:13:26,542 --> 00:13:29,250
Indeed a steel worker or any of us would be shaken

267
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:31,667
by having their blood drained and replaced

268
00:13:31,667 --> 00:13:35,167
with a yellow fluid especially if it is a mysterious yellow fluid

269
00:13:35,167 --> 00:13:38,501
the purpose of which we just do not know.

270
00:13:39,626 --> 00:13:42,417
And if it was done by aliens.

271
00:13:42,417 --> 00:13:46,501
And on top of it an alien that looked like that sketch which was made

272
00:13:46,501 --> 00:13:48,999
from his description.

273
00:13:49,083 --> 00:13:53,999
Shaken is just the beginning of our response to that experience.

274
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:56,417
(Laughter) So the poor steel worker probably lives

275
00:13:56,417 --> 00:14:01,375
in Akron, Ohio on to this day and will tell you his story.

276
00:14:01,667 --> 00:14:04,083
But that isn't what we mean by UFO's.

277
00:14:04,083 --> 00:14:06,167
Unfortunately we don't mean this either.

278
00:14:06,167 --> 00:14:07,083
This was a great picture from Paul Trent a farmer

279
00:14:07,083 --> 00:14:09,083
in McMinnville, Oregon.

280
00:14:09,292 --> 00:14:13,167
He took two pictures around 1950ish, late 40s, of this object

281
00:14:13,167 --> 00:14:16,626
he said which appeared over his farm.

282
00:14:16,626 --> 00:14:18,751
He took two and I'll show you both of them.

283
00:14:18,751 --> 00:14:19,959
They look pretty good.

284
00:14:19,959 --> 00:14:21,751
The debunkers did everything they could to show it was false and

285
00:14:21,751 --> 00:14:23,792
they couldn't falsify it.

286
00:14:23,792 --> 00:14:26,209
Then the number of pages and work and effort dedicated

287
00:14:26,209 --> 00:14:28,876
to it was extraordinary.

288
00:14:28,876 --> 00:14:30,501
That's the first of two photos.

289
00:14:30,501 --> 00:14:32,999
This is a few newspaper clippings.

290
00:14:32,999 --> 00:14:34,834
And what you see in the sky are photo one on the right,

291
00:14:34,834 --> 00:14:36,959
photo two on the left.

292
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:38,792
Tilted differently on the left.

293
00:14:41,125 --> 00:14:43,167
He was just a farmer.

294
00:14:43,167 --> 00:14:45,999
I talked to the people actually you go to great lengths.

295
00:14:46,083 --> 00:14:48,792
People who buried him and knew him all his life and said

296
00:14:48,792 --> 00:14:51,918
he always said this what's he had seen.

297
00:14:51,918 --> 00:14:53,292
This what's he photographed.

298
00:14:53,584 --> 00:14:55,999
And then this came in from France.

299
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:57,292
First it was said 54.

300
00:14:57,292 --> 00:14:58,292
Then '57.

301
00:14:58,999 --> 00:15:02,083
When you are following the Providence of a photo

302
00:15:02,083 --> 00:15:05,417
because we want to reject everything that can't be

303
00:15:05,417 --> 00:15:09,501
documented clearly and verified for accuracy, different dates,

304
00:15:09,501 --> 00:15:13,083
no one came forward as they would have had this picture

305
00:15:13,083 --> 00:15:17,334
been taken by gun camera footage from the French.

306
00:15:17,334 --> 00:15:21,999
It looks strikingly like if you remember the Trent photo.

307
00:15:22,125 --> 00:15:24,999
What it looks like is the Trent photo.

308
00:15:24,999 --> 00:15:27,999
Which someone has adjusted and changed a little bit.

309
00:15:28,125 --> 00:15:30,209
But it is the same photo.

310
00:15:30,209 --> 00:15:33,209
It's not a separate photo and there's no Providence for it.

311
00:15:33,209 --> 00:15:34,999
And that's not what we mean by UFO.

312
00:15:34,999 --> 00:15:37,834
That is things that seem to be false are not what we mean

313
00:15:37,834 --> 00:15:39,334
by UFO's.

314
00:15:39,334 --> 00:15:44,999
I just spent time only ten days ago here in Vegas with Francois from France.

315
00:15:45,292 --> 00:15:47,083
If you saw close encounters of the third kind he was

316
00:15:47,083 --> 00:15:49,334
like the Truffaut character.

317
00:15:49,542 --> 00:15:51,792
He worked with the official French organization

318
00:15:51,792 --> 00:15:54,626
that was dedicated to understanding and responding

319
00:15:54,626 --> 00:15:57,918
to the UFO phenomena from the top down.

320
00:15:57,918 --> 00:16:01,209
He helped resuscitate it as J Pan in 2006.

321
00:16:01,209 --> 00:16:03,501
He also worked with their spy satellite imagery

322
00:16:03,501 --> 00:16:05,999
programs for many years.

323
00:16:05,999 --> 00:16:06,999
He is no slouch.

324
00:16:06,999 --> 00:16:09,167
And now is a consultant he developed a program

325
00:16:09,167 --> 00:16:13,125
for photo analysis and demonstrated to me painstakingly

326
00:16:13,125 --> 00:16:19,334
the closer you get to that photo, that one, the pixels begin to change.

327
00:16:19,334 --> 00:16:20,667
And though the filament cannot be discerned

328
00:16:20,667 --> 00:16:24,167
on the photo you can see there is a filament there.

329
00:16:24,167 --> 00:16:27,459
That in two sigmas greater probability than not, that it is hanging

330
00:16:27,459 --> 00:16:31,584
by a very thin visible filament from that power line.

331
00:16:31,584 --> 00:16:35,375
And that's too damn bad because it is a great picture and great story.

332
00:16:35,375 --> 00:16:38,125
And that's not what we mean by UFO.

333
00:16:38,125 --> 00:16:39,999
But we do mean this.

334
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:43,334
Coast guard man Salem, Massachusetts, 1952.

335
00:16:43,334 --> 00:16:45,626
He is in his office and looks out the window.

336
00:16:45,626 --> 00:16:46,918
He sees that.

337
00:16:46,999 --> 00:16:48,375
He sees that and he takes his camera

338
00:16:48,375 --> 00:16:50,584
and takes this picture.

339
00:16:50,834 --> 00:16:53,083
He also shows a photograph which was published

340
00:16:53,083 --> 00:16:57,876
as news to which I will refer shortly, as news in the newspaper unidentified

341
00:16:57,876 --> 00:17:00,918
area phenomena in the east coast.

342
00:17:00,918 --> 00:17:03,417
Then newspapers reported it as news.

343
00:17:03,417 --> 00:17:04,417
Why?

344
00:17:04,417 --> 00:17:05,959
Because this is big news.

345
00:17:05,959 --> 00:17:08,501
When four vehicles in echelon formation are speeding

346
00:17:08,501 --> 00:17:13,083
through the sky surrounded by what looks like a plasma.

347
00:17:13,584 --> 00:17:15,999
And we'll say a little more about that later.

348
00:17:15,999 --> 00:17:18,334
This is what we mean by a UFO.

349
00:17:18,667 --> 00:17:21,125
We mean a genuine photograph of objects flying

350
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:25,250
in echelon formation demonstrating aerodynamic characteristics

351
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:29,999
and physical characteristics which at the time the picture was taken or

352
00:17:29,999 --> 00:17:34,792
the report was made could not be easily duplicated or in fact duplicated

353
00:17:34,792 --> 00:17:37,999
at all by any of us terrestrials.

354
00:17:37,999 --> 00:17:43,083
Not saying it's extraterrestrial I'm just saying we didn't know how to do that.

355
00:17:43,083 --> 00:17:45,542
We didn't know how to go from zero to a thousand.

356
00:17:45,751 --> 00:17:48,083
At a talk I gave at the random lake public library,

357
00:17:48,083 --> 00:17:52,334
88 year old man in back says I was in Korea running radar and I saw these

358
00:17:52,334 --> 00:17:56,792
things come across our screen at a thousand miles an hour.

359
00:17:56,959 --> 00:17:59,999
I called my superior officer and said should I report this.

360
00:17:59,999 --> 00:18:00,999
He said no.

361
00:18:00,999 --> 00:18:02,584
The radar is malfunctioning.

362
00:18:02,584 --> 00:18:04,667
He said then we should fix the radar.

363
00:18:04,667 --> 00:18:05,999
The response was no.

364
00:18:06,334 --> 00:18:08,709
So that was the end of that.

365
00:18:08,918 --> 00:18:10,459
(Laughter).

366
00:18:11,083 --> 00:18:14,083
So that's what you run into.

367
00:18:14,459 --> 00:18:16,209
So that's what a UFO is.

368
00:18:16,209 --> 00:18:17,999
This is what a UFO is.

369
00:18:17,999 --> 00:18:19,999
The modern era began in the 1940s with Foo Fighters,

370
00:18:19,999 --> 00:18:22,083
the French word for FAO.

371
00:18:25,876 --> 00:18:28,626
These glowing objects you see three arrows

372
00:18:28,626 --> 00:18:33,292
in the top and two glowing objects were widely reported from the German

373
00:18:33,292 --> 00:18:37,626
and Japanese theaters as pacing, trailing, following then taking

374
00:18:37,626 --> 00:18:41,292
off at an extraordinary rate of speed and going straight

375
00:18:41,292 --> 00:18:45,501
up or disappearing horizontally in the distance.

376
00:18:45,501 --> 00:18:47,292
And they glowed red and white like the plasmas that have become

377
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:48,876
so familiar.

378
00:18:49,167 --> 00:18:51,876
And we didn't know what they were.

379
00:18:51,999 --> 00:18:55,999
The military said it did not make any official response but, of course,

380
00:18:55,999 --> 00:18:59,626
using freedom of information act and other sources and archives

381
00:18:59,626 --> 00:19:03,375
and libraries and correspondence we've gotten the information that

382
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:05,334
in fact they did.

383
00:19:05,334 --> 00:19:07,918
They were very concerned about what these were.

384
00:19:07,918 --> 00:19:10,417
We thought they were German or Japanese.

385
00:19:10,417 --> 00:19:14,834
Because we were flying missions over Germany and over Japan.

386
00:19:14,834 --> 00:19:16,999
We learned after the war because we got most

387
00:19:16,999 --> 00:19:21,667
of the scientists and turned them from bad Nazis into good Americans,

388
00:19:21,667 --> 00:19:25,167
like Braun, some became bad communists.

389
00:19:25,167 --> 00:19:26,709
Which a bad Nazi would do.

390
00:19:26,876 --> 00:19:28,083
(Laughter).

391
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:32,999
But the best of them including Braun became our

392
00:19:32,999 --> 00:19:35,167
good American.

393
00:19:35,999 --> 00:19:38,751
Anyway we found out Germans didn't have them.

394
00:19:38,751 --> 00:19:40,375
They were as puzzled as we were.

395
00:19:40,375 --> 00:19:42,999
We got all the documents and so did the Russians.

396
00:19:42,999 --> 00:19:44,999
They didn't know what they were either.

397
00:19:44,999 --> 00:19:46,250
Neither did the Japanese.

398
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:47,999
So there was a military response.

399
00:19:47,999 --> 00:19:50,626
At least commanders writing to others saying escalate

400
00:19:50,626 --> 00:19:55,083
the hypothesis in order to understand what these are.

401
00:19:55,083 --> 00:19:57,999
And all they could think of was the category, the cognitive category,

402
00:19:57,999 --> 00:20:01,292
military operation against us by an enemy.

403
00:20:01,459 --> 00:20:04,375
Well, this continued.

404
00:20:04,375 --> 00:20:08,999
1947 is when we mark the beginning of, quote, the modern era that's that

405
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:11,999
is when Kenneth Arnold in Washington east

406
00:20:11,999 --> 00:20:16,959
of the mountains reported what he saw were nine silvery objects flying

407
00:20:16,959 --> 00:20:21,250
in a kind of skipping motion through the sky behind peaks then

408
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:23,667
out in front again.

409
00:20:23,667 --> 00:20:25,542
And when he landed he said they skipped through the air

410
00:20:25,542 --> 00:20:29,959
like saucers which good reporters reported as he said they were saucers.

411
00:20:29,999 --> 00:20:31,626
Then we had the word flying saucer which came

412
00:20:31,626 --> 00:20:33,417
into our lexicon.

413
00:20:33,417 --> 00:20:37,417
He said they were heel shaped with a straight edge.

414
00:20:37,417 --> 00:20:38,751
Then a rounded edge.

415
00:20:38,751 --> 00:20:40,167
It was reported flying saucers because he said they skipped

416
00:20:40,167 --> 00:20:42,250
through the air like saucers.

417
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:45,083
There were other reports all over the country

418
00:20:45,083 --> 00:20:48,083
in small local newspapers of sightings

419
00:20:48,083 --> 00:20:53,667
of disk and cigar shaped objects flying incredible and seemed strange

420
00:20:53,667 --> 00:21:00,209
and didn't make sense to us in 46 and 47 and it compelled the military.

421
00:21:00,209 --> 00:21:04,584
So we have a memo from a general I want

422
00:21:04,584 --> 00:21:08,292
to underscore some words.

423
00:21:08,292 --> 00:21:10,999
He said: It is the opinion that the phenomenon reported

424
00:21:10,999 --> 00:21:15,167
is something real and not visionary or fictitious.

425
00:21:15,167 --> 00:21:18,959
Under score real, not visionary, not fictitious.

426
00:21:18,959 --> 00:21:20,125
This is early on.

427
00:21:20,125 --> 00:21:22,250
They knew it was real.

428
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:23,250
Why?

429
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:25,083
Because not only people but sensors like radar detected

430
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:27,542
the objects in a consistent way which showed

431
00:21:27,542 --> 00:21:31,250
consistent characteristics and because credible people as we'll hear

432
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:35,083
in a minute saw what they called incredible things.

433
00:21:35,083 --> 00:21:36,999
They knew it was real.

434
00:21:36,999 --> 00:21:38,083
That's the basis.

435
00:21:38,083 --> 00:21:39,876
The sociological puzzle.

436
00:21:39,876 --> 00:21:43,751
And the psychological puzzle for the rest of the twentieth century

437
00:21:43,751 --> 00:21:48,542
is how we humans can hear this being said in the 1940s.

438
00:21:48,542 --> 00:21:50,459
They are real the general said.

439
00:21:50,459 --> 00:21:52,626
They are real the general said.

440
00:21:52,626 --> 00:21:58,584
And it does not penetrate our brain, drip, drip, drip, in any meaningful way.

441
00:21:58,584 --> 00:22:03,834
As to become the cornerstone or foundational anomaly that is a fact.

442
00:22:03,834 --> 00:22:04,999
Which Richard the great physicist said

443
00:22:04,999 --> 00:22:08,167
is where you begin to change the paradigm.

444
00:22:08,167 --> 00:22:11,417
Hates to be a fact and has to be anomalous.

445
00:22:11,667 --> 00:22:14,999
It cannot fit in our current model of understanding.

446
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:16,667
It has anomalous.

447
00:22:16,667 --> 00:22:18,083
We didn't know what they were.

448
00:22:18,083 --> 00:22:19,250
And it was a fact.

449
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:24,626
There are objects probably in the shape of a disk as such size

450
00:22:24,626 --> 00:22:28,792
is appear to be as large as manmade aircraft.

451
00:22:28,792 --> 00:22:32,083
Reported operating characteristics extreme rates of climb,

452
00:22:32,083 --> 00:22:36,542
maneuverability and actions which must be considered evasive when

453
00:22:36,542 --> 00:22:39,626
sighted by aircraft and radar.

454
00:22:39,626 --> 00:22:40,959
It was serious.

455
00:22:41,501 --> 00:22:44,959
The aerodynamic capability was reported to be far in excess

456
00:22:44,959 --> 00:22:48,999
of anything that we knew how to do or could engineer even though we may

457
00:22:48,999 --> 00:22:52,626
well have been working on trying to understand electric magnetic

458
00:22:52,626 --> 00:22:55,834
systems or propulsion systems that didn't just blow gas

459
00:22:55,834 --> 00:22:58,709
out of the back end of a object and push it forward

460
00:22:58,709 --> 00:23:00,999
in response with lift.

461
00:23:00,999 --> 00:23:03,083
They operated in a different way.

462
00:23:03,083 --> 00:23:05,999
And our observations confirmed that and we didn't know.

463
00:23:05,999 --> 00:23:08,417
I don't think we still know exactly how gravity was displaced

464
00:23:08,417 --> 00:23:12,501
or electromagnetic currents were generated that affected space time

465
00:23:12,501 --> 00:23:14,959
and affected the people that were close

466
00:23:14,959 --> 00:23:19,167
to the object in the way they have been reported to do.

467
00:23:19,709 --> 00:23:21,292
So they were real.

468
00:23:21,292 --> 00:23:22,918
Even Lyndon Johnson who was a congressman then said what's

469
00:23:22,918 --> 00:23:24,167
the story.

470
00:23:24,167 --> 00:23:25,417
I'm getting letters from constituents who see

471
00:23:25,417 --> 00:23:27,083
these things.

472
00:23:27,083 --> 00:23:30,626
He was told correctly, this is one half of the quote in the book,

473
00:23:30,626 --> 00:23:34,792
you get that I am just skipping through the highlights of 600 pages

474
00:23:34,792 --> 00:23:38,584
of well documented, complex, detailed history.

475
00:23:38,584 --> 00:23:41,459
We're investigating the flying disks.

476
00:23:41,459 --> 00:23:43,083
Detailed statements of credible witnesses are being

477
00:23:43,083 --> 00:23:44,999
carefully reviewed.

478
00:23:44,999 --> 00:23:46,876
Under score credible witnesses.

479
00:23:46,876 --> 00:23:48,999
They knew then that's what they were.

480
00:23:48,999 --> 00:23:52,709
And they were being carefully reviewed although not in public.

481
00:23:52,709 --> 00:23:54,999
Well they had to respond and they did.

482
00:23:54,999 --> 00:23:57,751
They formed project sign in 1948.

483
00:23:57,751 --> 00:24:00,876
There were three hypotheses considered by project sign.

484
00:24:00,876 --> 00:24:03,375
Which was staffed by people who were well intended

485
00:24:03,375 --> 00:24:07,083
and thought their commission, their task was to try to come

486
00:24:07,083 --> 00:24:10,999
up with a hypothesis that best fit the data they were presented

487
00:24:10,999 --> 00:24:14,999
and said what these things were likely to be.

488
00:24:14,999 --> 00:24:16,959
And there were three major hypotheses.

489
00:24:16,959 --> 00:24:17,959
They were Russian.

490
00:24:17,999 --> 00:24:19,501
They were American.

491
00:24:19,501 --> 00:24:23,083
And compartmented secret project that other people didn't know about.

492
00:24:23,667 --> 00:24:26,626
Or as they thought, extraterrestrial.

493
00:24:26,626 --> 00:24:29,751
These days people say maybe they're from another dimension.

494
00:24:30,959 --> 00:24:32,626
I won't go into.

495
00:24:32,626 --> 00:24:34,584
This talk isn't about their behaviors.

496
00:24:34,626 --> 00:24:37,792
But today we would expand on that and say there are variety

497
00:24:37,792 --> 00:24:41,292
of possibilities that might explain this if they are intelligent and

498
00:24:41,292 --> 00:24:43,417
if they are visitors.

499
00:24:43,417 --> 00:24:46,792
But at that time it was Russian or American or extraterrestrial.

500
00:24:46,792 --> 00:24:49,751
The Russians why not over flying our cities and missile bases

501
00:24:49,751 --> 00:24:51,459
and airports.

502
00:24:51,459 --> 00:24:52,584
They really weren't.

503
00:24:52,584 --> 00:24:53,584
They couldn't.

504
00:24:53,584 --> 00:24:56,250
They would have been in big trouble had they done that.

505
00:24:56,250 --> 00:24:58,125
If it was an American project, let's flash forward

506
00:24:58,125 --> 00:25:01,751
a few decades when Edward Mitchell, Apollo 14, said to me

507
00:25:01,751 --> 00:25:05,999
with a straight face, Richard, he said, if we can do what they can do,

508
00:25:05,999 --> 00:25:10,334
they would not have sent me to the moon in a Tin Lizzie.

509
00:25:11,083 --> 00:25:15,542
This is a man who spent several days cramped up in a tin can going

510
00:25:15,542 --> 00:25:19,250
to the moon, walking on the moon, and who coming back had

511
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:23,292
a life changing experience in which he determined, perceived,

512
00:25:23,292 --> 00:25:26,751
experienced the unity of all things.

513
00:25:26,751 --> 00:25:28,999
The inner connectiveness, the non local connectiveness

514
00:25:28,999 --> 00:25:32,667
and consciousness of all things and has devoted his life ever

515
00:25:32,667 --> 00:25:37,417
after to try to articulate that so people could very frustrating very lonely so

516
00:25:37,417 --> 00:25:40,792
people could understand what he experienced when he saw

517
00:25:40,792 --> 00:25:43,751
the unity of all things like a Misick coming back

518
00:25:43,751 --> 00:25:45,542
from the moon.

519
00:25:45,584 --> 00:25:48,167
They wouldn't have sent me to the moon in a tin Lizzie

520
00:25:48,167 --> 00:25:51,250
if we knew how to move like that, he said.

521
00:25:51,375 --> 00:25:54,751
So it was determined that they were not American.

522
00:25:54,751 --> 00:25:56,125
Make the story very short.

523
00:25:56,125 --> 00:25:58,083
It was not a compartmented project and we did not have

524
00:25:58,083 --> 00:26:00,834
the technological ability to do that.

525
00:26:01,459 --> 00:26:04,999
The third hypothesis was the most likely.

526
00:26:04,999 --> 00:26:07,709
The least unlikely hypothesis that explain what's we are looking

527
00:26:07,709 --> 00:26:11,999
at as data and evidence is the extraterrestrial hypothesis.

528
00:26:11,999 --> 00:26:14,125
They wrote an estimate of the situation which is what you did

529
00:26:14,125 --> 00:26:16,667
in that domain and sent it up the chain of command

530
00:26:16,667 --> 00:26:19,417
to Vandenberg the general at the top.

531
00:26:19,626 --> 00:26:23,167
He responded by saying I refuse to accept that.

532
00:26:23,417 --> 00:26:24,999
Knocked it back down.

533
00:26:24,999 --> 00:26:28,375
It went back down the chain of command and it was disbanded.

534
00:26:28,375 --> 00:26:28,999
But they had to do something more so

535
00:26:28,999 --> 00:26:31,083
they did project grudge.

536
00:26:31,083 --> 00:26:34,542
The name of which signifies the attitude of people in it.

537
00:26:35,626 --> 00:26:38,542
When your commanding officer says I refuse to accept

538
00:26:38,542 --> 00:26:42,375
the likely hypothesis that explains the data then you know your task

539
00:26:42,375 --> 00:26:46,459
is to come up with a hypothesis that is probably much less accurate than

540
00:26:46,459 --> 00:26:49,542
that and, therefore, just spin your wheels, kill time,

541
00:26:49,542 --> 00:26:53,626
have lunch, take long naps and come up with something.

542
00:26:54,334 --> 00:26:57,918
Well we don't have the estimate of the situation.

543
00:26:57,918 --> 00:26:58,999
There is one copy.

544
00:26:58,999 --> 00:27:01,999
It's kind of like the end of "Raiders of The Lost Arc."

545
00:27:01,999 --> 00:27:03,999
It's hidden in a warehouse somewhere.

546
00:27:03,999 --> 00:27:06,209
But we do have the report of captain Rue pelt who was

547
00:27:06,209 --> 00:27:08,999
the first head of project blue book later

548
00:27:08,999 --> 00:27:12,459
on that it existed and what was in it.

549
00:27:12,459 --> 00:27:13,999
It was that hypothesis.

550
00:27:13,999 --> 00:27:15,584
And that's what was rejected.

551
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:17,292
Project grudge had a different attitude and they came

552
00:27:17,292 --> 00:27:18,999
up with this.

553
00:27:18,999 --> 00:27:20,250
Look at this press release.

554
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:21,667
Evaluate it for yourself.

555
00:27:21,667 --> 00:27:23,999
We have investigated and evaluated blank.

556
00:27:23,999 --> 00:27:26,667
That is whatever is reported to be occurring and have found nothing

557
00:27:26,667 --> 00:27:31,250
of value which would change our previous estimates on the subject.

558
00:27:31,959 --> 00:27:34,167
We had mimeo machines then.

559
00:27:34,167 --> 00:27:35,459
Not digital.

560
00:27:35,999 --> 00:27:39,375
Crank out this press release and distribute to all people on bases.

561
00:27:39,375 --> 00:27:42,083
And when anyone reports anything like an unidentified flying object fill

562
00:27:42,083 --> 00:27:45,167
in the blank with the name of the incident and say it's been

563
00:27:45,167 --> 00:27:47,876
investigated and it's nothing.

564
00:27:48,167 --> 00:27:50,999
That was just an expedient response.

565
00:27:50,999 --> 00:27:53,209
Some were unhappy like general cable.

566
00:27:53,209 --> 00:27:55,999
He said what the hell do I have to do actually said what do I have

567
00:27:55,999 --> 00:27:57,999
to do to stir up action.

568
00:27:57,999 --> 00:27:59,292
Anyone can see we do not have a satisfactory answer

569
00:27:59,292 --> 00:28:01,292
to the saucer question.

570
00:28:01,292 --> 00:28:03,209
I want a answer and good answer.

571
00:28:03,209 --> 00:28:05,999
In other words, the government was not just one thing.

572
00:28:05,999 --> 00:28:08,999
There are people who looked at the data and knew it was real.

573
00:28:10,999 --> 00:28:14,542
Of course the problem was they didn't have an answer.

574
00:28:14,542 --> 00:28:16,083
They didn't know what it was.

575
00:28:16,083 --> 00:28:19,083
They didn't know what it was doing or doing here.

576
00:28:19,083 --> 00:28:23,959
And above all, this is critical, they wanted to know if it was a threat.

577
00:28:23,999 --> 00:28:26,417
Because it was a Russian thing it was a threat.

578
00:28:26,417 --> 00:28:27,459
It wasn't Russian.

579
00:28:27,459 --> 00:28:29,250
But is it invaders from mars?

580
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:30,501
Are they going to eat us?

581
00:28:30,501 --> 00:28:33,999
Is it Clateau come down telling us to get rid of our nuclear weapons?

582
00:28:34,083 --> 00:28:37,125
Gonna stop the roller coaster from going for 20 minutes to get

583
00:28:37,125 --> 00:28:39,334
the attention of earth?

584
00:28:39,334 --> 00:28:41,083
It's not doing any of those things.

585
00:28:41,083 --> 00:28:45,792
What kind of a threat to our national security might this be?

586
00:28:45,792 --> 00:28:48,709
Post World War II, Europe is in rubble.

587
00:28:48,709 --> 00:28:52,209
The martial plan is cranked up as a way to reconstitute Europe.

588
00:28:52,209 --> 00:28:56,083
You guys are kids and don't remember that Europe was destroyed

589
00:28:56,083 --> 00:28:58,292
by World War II.

590
00:28:58,292 --> 00:29:00,792
It was like Syria today.

591
00:29:01,792 --> 00:29:05,083
The Russians were cranking up the cold war.

592
00:29:05,083 --> 00:29:07,626
We were engaged in a new kind of battle.

593
00:29:07,626 --> 00:29:11,083
The iron curtain had descended across Europe, et cetera, et cetera.

594
00:29:11,083 --> 00:29:14,501
In light of those concerns and paranoia and anti communistic,

595
00:29:14,501 --> 00:29:18,083
not just paranoia but realistic concerns that we had

596
00:29:18,083 --> 00:29:21,542
in those years, whether or not an aerial phenomena

597
00:29:21,542 --> 00:29:26,125
of this sort was a threat was a very important thing.

598
00:29:26,125 --> 00:29:28,292
And it was primarily what they looked at.

599
00:29:28,292 --> 00:29:34,083
What is the national security evaluation of this phenomena in these incidents?

600
00:29:34,083 --> 00:29:37,083
Well some still claim they were a mirage.

601
00:29:37,083 --> 00:29:40,792
But let's flash forward again skipping ahead, 1952.

602
00:29:41,125 --> 00:29:42,959
A significant year.

603
00:29:42,959 --> 00:29:45,083
Do you fire on a mirage?

604
00:29:45,083 --> 00:29:46,918
Do you fire on a hallucination?

605
00:29:46,918 --> 00:29:49,667
Quote, we quote we have quotes around and footnotes

606
00:29:49,667 --> 00:29:53,999
and documentation for every damn thing in the book.

607
00:29:53,999 --> 00:29:55,751
There is nothing speculative.

608
00:29:55,751 --> 00:29:58,792
It's from the government's own documents.

609
00:29:58,792 --> 00:30:01,709
That for 50 years this dedicated one would say obsessive,

610
00:30:01,709 --> 00:30:05,375
compulsive team and do you know anyone who is interesting who

611
00:30:05,375 --> 00:30:07,417
is not obsessive?

612
00:30:07,417 --> 00:30:09,709
Certainly not in this CON, right?

613
00:30:10,876 --> 00:30:14,999
'52 at a distance of 130 miles the quote goes ...

614
00:30:14,999 --> 00:30:17,125
northeast of Washington, D.C., relevant.

615
00:30:17,125 --> 00:30:21,584
In a minute three different Army radar units detected an object at 18,000 feet.

616
00:30:21,584 --> 00:30:22,709
Strong signal.

617
00:30:22,709 --> 00:30:24,083
Not an inversion, not a bogey.

618
00:30:24,083 --> 00:30:26,417
Not a blip that wasn't explained.

619
00:30:26,417 --> 00:30:29,667
Remains stationary on radar for 30 minutes then began to move.

620
00:30:29,667 --> 00:30:31,876
By the time it reached the end of the scopes alluded it was going

621
00:30:31,876 --> 00:30:33,999
a thousand miles an hour.

622
00:30:33,999 --> 00:30:35,209
Our report went all the way to the pentagon and

623
00:30:35,209 --> 00:30:38,167
the order came back if another came in, fire out.

624
00:30:38,918 --> 00:30:42,999
After that first night we loaded our 999 millimeter guns unusual to do

625
00:30:42,999 --> 00:30:45,167
in a populated area.

626
00:30:45,167 --> 00:30:47,999
You don't hear them going off over Nellis right now or

627
00:30:47,999 --> 00:30:49,999
over the strip.

628
00:30:49,999 --> 00:30:55,083
We don't fire those kind of guns over populated areas at nothing.

629
00:30:55,584 --> 00:30:59,709
We scrambled F 94 jet fighters from McGwire Airforce base.

630
00:30:59,709 --> 00:31:00,999
They didn't see them again.

631
00:31:00,999 --> 00:31:01,999
They didn't fire.

632
00:31:01,999 --> 00:31:03,959
But they were ready to engage in combat not

633
00:31:03,959 --> 00:31:07,209
with a fictitious object but with a threatening object

634
00:31:07,209 --> 00:31:09,626
because it invaded the airspace which

635
00:31:09,626 --> 00:31:13,459
the Airforce was commissioned to protect and defend on behalf

636
00:31:13,459 --> 00:31:15,999
of the American people.

637
00:31:15,999 --> 00:31:18,125
And it has a lot of investment in having done so

638
00:31:18,125 --> 00:31:22,083
during World War II to an extraordinary degree.

639
00:31:22,083 --> 00:31:25,292
This was really a threat and challenge to everything.

640
00:31:25,292 --> 00:31:26,292
To group thing.

641
00:31:26,292 --> 00:31:27,292
To ego.

642
00:31:27,292 --> 00:31:28,918
To institutional mentality.

643
00:31:28,918 --> 00:31:31,999
Everything legitimate and maybe not as legitimate as well.

644
00:31:32,083 --> 00:31:35,083
But I said that was June 1952.

645
00:31:35,083 --> 00:31:37,417
In July Washington, D.C.

646
00:31:37,417 --> 00:31:40,083
very famous in the cycle.

647
00:31:40,375 --> 00:31:42,584
Eight days over Washington, D.C.

648
00:31:42,584 --> 00:31:46,459
so many objects appeared so often they were seen by multiple pilots.

649
00:31:46,459 --> 00:31:47,459
They were seen by multiple witnesses

650
00:31:47,459 --> 00:31:50,918
on the ground and tracked by the air traffic control stations

651
00:31:50,918 --> 00:31:53,209
on radar in multiple ways.

652
00:31:53,209 --> 00:31:56,083
So multiple witnesses all correlated to the same points and

653
00:31:56,083 --> 00:31:59,626
the same objects and fighters were scrambled and chased them

654
00:31:59,626 --> 00:32:01,999
and couldn't catch them.

655
00:32:01,999 --> 00:32:04,417
Said one poor guy who was chasing one.

656
00:32:04,417 --> 00:32:06,999
Then instead of fleeing as they do, they just play cat and mouse,

657
00:32:06,999 --> 00:32:09,083
it came back toward him.

658
00:32:09,083 --> 00:32:09,999
When he looked around another was coming

659
00:32:09,999 --> 00:32:11,999
toward him from this side.

660
00:32:11,999 --> 00:32:14,083
When you look at the radar screen that is replicated

661
00:32:14,083 --> 00:32:16,999
by the transmission by the transcript of the conversation

662
00:32:16,999 --> 00:32:20,667
with the air traffic controller, you see his blip here and you see circle

663
00:32:20,667 --> 00:32:22,999
of closing blips around him.

664
00:32:22,999 --> 00:32:26,626
And he said the equivalent of holy smokes.

665
00:32:26,626 --> 00:32:27,626
(Laughter).

666
00:32:29,459 --> 00:32:31,375
How do I get out of here?

667
00:32:31,375 --> 00:32:34,667
Well if there was a they, something heard it too.

668
00:32:34,667 --> 00:32:36,125
Because then the blips parted.

669
00:32:36,125 --> 00:32:38,751
And there were multiple witnesses to this event.

670
00:32:38,751 --> 00:32:40,999
And general Samford said at a press conference

671
00:32:40,999 --> 00:32:45,709
before they decided the whole thing of eight days duration was an inversion,

672
00:32:45,709 --> 00:32:48,999
a weather inversion despite the contrary indications

673
00:32:48,999 --> 00:32:52,167
from meteorologists, he said credible people have seen

674
00:32:52,167 --> 00:32:54,334
incredible things.

675
00:32:54,334 --> 00:32:56,417
It was news still.

676
00:32:56,417 --> 00:32:57,417
'52.

677
00:32:57,417 --> 00:32:59,834
That's the front page of the Washington Post.

678
00:32:59,834 --> 00:33:01,792
Can you imagine that today?

679
00:33:01,792 --> 00:33:05,459
The "Washington Post," the "New York Times" saucer not pilot

680
00:33:05,459 --> 00:33:09,626
speculates, pilot thinks, pilot reveals.

681
00:33:09,626 --> 00:33:10,918
He chased it.

682
00:33:10,918 --> 00:33:13,083
And it flew away so fast he couldn't catch it.

683
00:33:13,083 --> 00:33:14,999
I can show you numerous clippings.

684
00:33:14,999 --> 00:33:18,417
We have literally thousands of clippings that we've painstakingly

685
00:33:18,417 --> 00:33:22,542
gathered from around the country from old periodicals as well

686
00:33:22,542 --> 00:33:25,999
as other archives that in this case there are many

687
00:33:25,999 --> 00:33:27,999
about this week.

688
00:33:27,999 --> 00:33:30,083
New York Times, other papers carried it as news

689
00:33:30,083 --> 00:33:33,918
because an investigation had to be in secret after the chase

690
00:33:33,918 --> 00:33:35,959
over the capital.

691
00:33:35,959 --> 00:33:37,999
So it was news.

692
00:33:38,334 --> 00:33:39,834
It was big news.

693
00:33:39,834 --> 00:33:40,918
That was important.

694
00:33:40,918 --> 00:33:43,334
So they had to do something in response to this.

695
00:33:43,334 --> 00:33:44,999
They created project blue book.

696
00:33:44,999 --> 00:33:46,959
These things were over the capital.

697
00:33:46,959 --> 00:33:48,417
They were over the White House.

698
00:33:48,959 --> 00:33:52,459
They didn't land at the White House, but they were over the White House.

699
00:33:52,542 --> 00:33:54,999
They hired Dr. Alan Hyman of Northwestern University,

700
00:33:54,999 --> 00:33:59,209
a famous astronomer to be the research for project Bluebook.

701
00:33:59,375 --> 00:34:02,167
The CIA got involved and concluded a study listen

702
00:34:02,167 --> 00:34:06,417
to these words carefully because they signify what we document

703
00:34:06,417 --> 00:34:09,999
in greater detail a direction that was subsequently

704
00:34:09,999 --> 00:34:14,876
followed after the Robertson panel met, convened Airforce and CIA people

705
00:34:14,876 --> 00:34:18,709
in 1953 and decided on a plan of response that made sense

706
00:34:18,709 --> 00:34:22,834
to them and it kind of went aligned with this.

707
00:34:22,834 --> 00:34:25,959
Flying saucers are not a threat to national security.

708
00:34:25,959 --> 00:34:27,250
Didn't say they're not real.

709
00:34:27,250 --> 00:34:28,999
They said they're not attacking.

710
00:34:28,999 --> 00:34:29,999
They're not a threat.

711
00:34:29,999 --> 00:34:30,999
They fly around.

712
00:34:30,999 --> 00:34:32,999
What is a threat to national security?

713
00:34:32,999 --> 00:34:35,417
Reports of flying saucers are.

714
00:34:35,667 --> 00:34:39,083
Therefore, military personnel should be trained in proper observation

715
00:34:39,083 --> 00:34:41,125
of flying saucers.

716
00:34:41,125 --> 00:34:43,167
At this point we can speculate and ask the question why should

717
00:34:43,167 --> 00:34:44,999
they be trained?

718
00:34:49,999 --> 00:34:52,999
(Laughter) You are not kidding?

719
00:34:52,999 --> 00:34:53,999
Okay.

720
00:34:53,999 --> 00:34:55,999
You think I was talking fast before?

721
00:34:57,999 --> 00:34:59,083
(Laughter).

722
00:34:59,209 --> 00:35:02,542
Look at them, learn everything you can from them.

723
00:35:02,542 --> 00:35:04,209
Figure out what they are if you can.

724
00:35:04,209 --> 00:35:06,334
Figure out how to reverse engineer them.

725
00:35:06,334 --> 00:35:08,626
Do research and development along the line that's many programs

726
00:35:08,626 --> 00:35:11,876
seem somehow but that's all speculative to have followed

727
00:35:11,876 --> 00:35:15,083
in order to find a way to move like that.

728
00:35:15,959 --> 00:35:19,918
Also at the same time create programs to debunk flying saucers

729
00:35:19,918 --> 00:35:21,999
to the citizenry.

730
00:35:21,999 --> 00:35:24,999
There you have it.

731
00:35:24,999 --> 00:35:26,209
There you have it.

732
00:35:26,292 --> 00:35:29,709
Alan said it's characterized by a constant flow of reports.

733
00:35:29,709 --> 00:35:30,709
This is later.

734
00:35:30,709 --> 00:35:32,792
I'm jumping ahead as I need to now.

735
00:35:33,083 --> 00:35:35,584
These are from highly responsible people.

736
00:35:35,584 --> 00:35:37,959
Either something strange is going around or I'm going have

737
00:35:37,959 --> 00:35:40,459
to call all these people liars.

738
00:35:40,501 --> 00:35:42,459
If there are independent witnesses you have quite

739
00:35:42,459 --> 00:35:45,459
a job proving they're all hallucinating.

740
00:35:45,459 --> 00:35:47,125
He began a skeptic.

741
00:35:47,125 --> 00:35:50,918
As reports came in and as he did on the ground investigations

742
00:35:50,918 --> 00:35:54,459
in detail like with Father McGill in Papua New Guinea

743
00:35:54,459 --> 00:35:58,999
an extraordinary case or Lenny Somaro in New Mexico.

744
00:35:59,751 --> 00:36:02,584
He came increasingly to be convinced exactly what

745
00:36:02,584 --> 00:36:04,292
he says here.

746
00:36:04,292 --> 00:36:05,834
These people are not lying.

747
00:36:05,834 --> 00:36:06,834
They're not crazy.

748
00:36:06,876 --> 00:36:10,834
Something's going on, and it's global 150 countries.

749
00:36:11,125 --> 00:36:17,999
It is reports in the same level of detail, the same idiosyncratic detail.

750
00:36:17,999 --> 00:36:20,999
Same granular detail from all over the world.

751
00:36:20,999 --> 00:36:21,751
As a friend of mine at NSA who wrote

752
00:36:21,751 --> 00:36:24,292
a paper disseminated through the agency said what's funny

753
00:36:24,292 --> 00:36:26,999
in America is not funny everywhere.

754
00:36:26,999 --> 00:36:29,417
What's funny for one year isn't funny for 50.

755
00:36:29,417 --> 00:36:32,999
And they agree in the small details from all over the world.

756
00:36:33,334 --> 00:36:35,999
So 20 years later when he became disgusted

757
00:36:35,999 --> 00:36:39,250
with the realization that project Blue Book was

758
00:36:39,250 --> 00:36:44,167
a public relations effort designed to placate and cover whatever was

759
00:36:44,167 --> 00:36:49,167
really happening, in other words with the least untruthful things one

760
00:36:49,167 --> 00:36:52,999
could say while still lying in public.

761
00:36:53,083 --> 00:36:57,167
Because that's simply the nature of cover and deception.

762
00:36:57,167 --> 00:36:59,959
I'm not saying something controversial there.

763
00:36:59,959 --> 00:37:00,999
That's how it's done.

764
00:37:00,999 --> 00:37:02,125
It's not a conspiracy.

765
00:37:02,125 --> 00:37:03,459
It's policy.

766
00:37:03,667 --> 00:37:05,876
And the people who form the policy, yes they meet in rooms,

767
00:37:05,876 --> 00:37:07,959
but it doesn't mean I am a conspiracy theorist

768
00:37:07,959 --> 00:37:09,999
or they're conspirators.

769
00:37:09,999 --> 00:37:11,792
It is the nature of the national securely state

770
00:37:11,792 --> 00:37:15,334
with the degree of secrecy and the high degree of classification

771
00:37:15,334 --> 00:37:19,459
and the necessity therefore when something is believed that it should be

772
00:37:19,459 --> 00:37:22,751
covered appropriately and a lot of people think they made

773
00:37:22,751 --> 00:37:26,999
the right decisions to decide this in light of national security concerns,

774
00:37:26,999 --> 00:37:29,999
then you do say the least untruthful thing you can say

775
00:37:29,999 --> 00:37:33,876
in public while still maintaining the cover story.

776
00:37:33,999 --> 00:37:36,999
But this is what it does to the public.

777
00:37:36,999 --> 00:37:39,999
And that's why people are so disoriented by the revelations

778
00:37:39,999 --> 00:37:43,999
about what we are doing at a government level.

779
00:37:43,999 --> 00:37:46,667
The public he said was placed in the role of the enemy.

780
00:37:46,667 --> 00:37:49,834
Against counter espionage tactics must be employed.

781
00:37:49,834 --> 00:37:52,667
From my experience I felt those in charge considered people reported

782
00:37:52,667 --> 00:37:55,751
or took a serious interest in UFO's and just wanted to know

783
00:37:55,751 --> 00:37:58,999
about them like shmucks like me, what's going on on the planet,

784
00:37:58,999 --> 00:38:00,999
they were enemies.

785
00:38:00,999 --> 00:38:03,542
Just as today it is difficult distinguish them

786
00:38:03,542 --> 00:38:05,999
from whistle blowers from terrorists

787
00:38:05,999 --> 00:38:08,999
from religion zealots from concerned citizens

788
00:38:08,999 --> 00:38:11,083
from journalists.

789
00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:13,751
They all behave the same way.

790
00:38:13,751 --> 00:38:16,334
It's allegiance, perceived allegiance that determines

791
00:38:16,334 --> 00:38:19,292
whether or not they're an enemy.

792
00:38:19,667 --> 00:38:22,501
A hacker is simply a hacker.

793
00:38:22,542 --> 00:38:24,999
I've defined it correctly I think.

794
00:38:24,999 --> 00:38:30,167
A Black Hat hacker is a hacker who knows when to lie.

795
00:38:30,834 --> 00:38:33,999
A gray Hat hacker is a hacker who knows

796
00:38:33,999 --> 00:38:38,501
whether it's appropriate to fudge the truth.

797
00:38:38,501 --> 00:38:40,959
A WhiteHat hacker is a hacker who put the truth

798
00:38:40,959 --> 00:38:45,083
down somewhere and can't remember where he left it.

799
00:38:45,083 --> 00:38:46,083
Just what it is.

800
00:38:46,083 --> 00:38:47,584
So what is a UFO?

801
00:38:47,667 --> 00:38:49,417
Have to do this quick.

802
00:38:49,417 --> 00:38:51,083
Herman on Bert, van Braun who I mentioned

803
00:38:51,083 --> 00:38:53,999
for this reason his mentor in rocketry looked

804
00:38:53,999 --> 00:38:57,375
at he says not three or four but 50 radar measurements

805
00:38:57,375 --> 00:39:00,083
from Airforce and Navy jets.

806
00:39:00,083 --> 00:39:04,999
These are notes from a lecture he gave in Germany.

807
00:39:05,125 --> 00:39:07,292
They can't all be so inaccurate.

808
00:39:07,292 --> 00:39:10,375
What was he talking about that he said was legitimate?

809
00:39:10,375 --> 00:39:11,876
He was speaking of extraordinary speeds

810
00:39:11,876 --> 00:39:13,626
and maneuvers.

811
00:39:13,709 --> 00:39:17,167
If you ask what those were he said they fly in this way.

812
00:39:17,167 --> 00:39:18,999
You can look at the details later.

813
00:39:18,999 --> 00:39:20,959
In sunlight which is brighter than the objects themselves

814
00:39:20,959 --> 00:39:22,999
they glitter like metal.

815
00:39:22,999 --> 00:39:25,083
They're dark orange and cherry red at night.

816
00:39:25,083 --> 00:39:27,083
If they don't need much power when suspended, hovering,

817
00:39:27,083 --> 00:39:29,250
they don't shine much.

818
00:39:29,250 --> 00:39:31,999
But if they start really moving shining brightens.

819
00:39:31,999 --> 00:39:34,292
They turn yellow, yellow green like a copper flame and a state

820
00:39:34,292 --> 00:39:36,709
of high speed acceleration.

821
00:39:36,999 --> 00:39:39,626
Is that arcane or mysterious?

822
00:39:39,626 --> 00:39:41,459
No according to Paul hill.

823
00:39:41,709 --> 00:39:44,375
He was at NASA many decades.

824
00:39:44,375 --> 00:39:47,250
He was fascinated by UFO's having had his own sightings.

825
00:39:47,250 --> 00:39:48,584
He was allowed to collect whatever data

826
00:39:48,584 --> 00:39:51,501
and information he could undercover.

827
00:39:51,501 --> 00:39:53,999
Because NASA's official position is we don't investigate them and

828
00:39:53,999 --> 00:39:55,792
they don't exist.

829
00:39:56,083 --> 00:39:58,999
But he was allowed to do that and his book was published

830
00:39:58,999 --> 00:40:02,334
by his daughter posthumously as unconventional fly objects

831
00:40:02,334 --> 00:40:05,709
a scientific analysis which he spells outs best he could

832
00:40:05,709 --> 00:40:09,000
with his limited ability but supreme knowledge the physics

833
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:12,709
of what had been observed by him and others.

834
00:40:12,999 --> 00:40:14,125
Five minutes?

835
00:40:14,125 --> 00:40:15,125
Okay.

836
00:40:15,209 --> 00:40:17,709
In the chapter on illumination he creates it

837
00:40:17,709 --> 00:40:21,751
with the corresponding colors exactly as Oberth has described

838
00:40:21,751 --> 00:40:24,792
and many people have described.

839
00:40:25,167 --> 00:40:29,999
They come from radiation generated by the (inaudible).

840
00:40:31,999 --> 00:40:33,501
Then blue.

841
00:40:33,501 --> 00:40:34,501
Blue and white.

842
00:40:34,501 --> 00:40:35,501
White and blue.

843
00:40:35,751 --> 00:40:38,042
A strong radiation peak, et cetera, et cetera.

844
00:40:38,042 --> 00:40:39,250
In other words, people are corroborating

845
00:40:39,250 --> 00:40:41,834
and correlating data and they are making sense

846
00:40:41,834 --> 00:40:43,792
of the same thing.

847
00:40:43,999 --> 00:40:46,375
During the 1950s, project blue book always explained

848
00:40:46,375 --> 00:40:49,834
away everything except those it couldn't.

849
00:40:49,999 --> 00:40:52,459
Then those were listed as unexplained and treated separately

850
00:40:52,459 --> 00:40:54,667
as if they didn't count.

851
00:40:54,667 --> 00:40:57,083
The Airforce has a wonderful manual that it issued

852
00:40:57,083 --> 00:41:02,709
in 1970s to the Airforce cadets at the United States Airforce academy.

853
00:41:02,709 --> 00:41:04,167
It had one chapter on UFO's.

854
00:41:04,167 --> 00:41:07,792
Half was cases of unexplained unidentified objects.

855
00:41:07,792 --> 00:41:10,584
And they made the statement in the discussion section.

856
00:41:10,584 --> 00:41:11,751
And I'm paraphrasing.

857
00:41:11,999 --> 00:41:14,999
The uncorrelated data strongly suggest we are being visited by three

858
00:41:14,999 --> 00:41:17,083
or four civilizations.

859
00:41:17,999 --> 00:41:20,999
Left that in.

860
00:41:20,999 --> 00:41:23,375
Then when people got wind of this chapter somebody was realized

861
00:41:23,375 --> 00:41:25,709
to have made a mistake.

862
00:41:25,709 --> 00:41:26,959
The book was retracted.

863
00:41:26,959 --> 00:41:27,959
All were pulled.

864
00:41:27,959 --> 00:41:29,209
A new addition was issued.

865
00:41:29,209 --> 00:41:30,999
The last chapter was rewritten.

866
00:41:30,999 --> 00:41:32,667
All the cases were removed and the statement was made there's nothing

867
00:41:32,667 --> 00:41:33,959
to it.

868
00:41:33,999 --> 00:41:35,459
We think it's interesting for cadets to consider anomalies

869
00:41:35,459 --> 00:41:37,876
because it challenged their thinking.

870
00:41:38,083 --> 00:41:42,542
But they said three to four civilizations are likely visiting

871
00:41:42,542 --> 00:41:44,999
based on reports.

872
00:41:44,999 --> 00:41:47,918
But there are other cases like the RB 47 bomber.

873
00:41:48,083 --> 00:41:51,125
Numerous events in the 70s.

874
00:41:51,125 --> 00:41:53,584
A wave prompted a need to have it done scientifically and

875
00:41:53,584 --> 00:41:58,250
the Airforce was sick of this because it couldn't deal with it.

876
00:41:58,250 --> 00:42:01,375
They appointed the committee at the University of Colorado.

877
00:42:02,083 --> 00:42:06,083
One of the best chapters in this book is the detailed work Mike the experts

878
00:42:06,083 --> 00:42:09,459
on the committee has done to show the politics how that reached

879
00:42:09,459 --> 00:42:11,292
this conclusion.

880
00:42:11,292 --> 00:42:13,459
They have to jump ahead to the conclusion.

881
00:42:13,459 --> 00:42:17,751
1500 page work including numerous cases unexplained and unidentified.

882
00:42:17,834 --> 00:42:19,834
Then one chapter, the only chapter Condon wrote

883
00:42:19,834 --> 00:42:23,250
without consulting his own 1500 pages of work by his committee and

884
00:42:23,250 --> 00:42:25,918
without doing any field investigation, in which

885
00:42:25,918 --> 00:42:28,501
he concluded there was nothing to it and no reason

886
00:42:28,501 --> 00:42:31,501
to be investigating them any further.

887
00:42:31,501 --> 00:42:32,834
And the Airforce as intended breathed a sigh

888
00:42:32,834 --> 00:42:36,250
of relief and said we're out of the business of UFO's.

889
00:42:36,542 --> 00:42:38,584
They're not going to investigate anything anymore U.

890
00:42:38,584 --> 00:42:42,167
Will get a boiler plate letter if you report something.

891
00:42:42,167 --> 00:42:43,999
We don't do this call your police.

892
00:42:43,999 --> 00:42:45,709
However Barry Greenwood using FOIA found

893
00:42:45,709 --> 00:42:48,501
out they were very much interested in what was going

894
00:42:48,501 --> 00:42:51,375
on across the northern tier of the country in the 70s

895
00:42:51,375 --> 00:42:54,292
like the Airforce base which is on the web (inaudible)

896
00:42:54,292 --> 00:42:57,792
in Minneapolis has done an incredible presentation documenting

897
00:42:57,792 --> 00:43:01,375
and detailing what happened at the Airforce base.

898
00:43:01,375 --> 00:43:02,334
They said nothing happened but freedom

899
00:43:02,334 --> 00:43:05,083
of information act got 24 documents describing indeed

900
00:43:05,083 --> 00:43:07,083
something happened.

901
00:43:07,083 --> 00:43:09,250
Across the whole northern tier all the way

902
00:43:09,250 --> 00:43:12,999
to Montana remarkable events took place.

903
00:43:12,999 --> 00:43:14,834
Which which I encourage you to do your own thinking

904
00:43:14,834 --> 00:43:18,999
and do your own research and find out what was going on.

905
00:43:18,999 --> 00:43:21,876
Because the manner of dealing with it was to debunk,

906
00:43:21,876 --> 00:43:24,334
to ridicule and demean.

907
00:43:24,334 --> 00:43:25,751
How did they do it?

908
00:43:25,751 --> 00:43:26,999
How do they do it?

909
00:43:27,667 --> 00:43:31,250
A friend of mine at NSA teaches deception.

910
00:43:31,250 --> 00:43:33,375
Three legs to the stool.

911
00:43:33,375 --> 00:43:36,834
Illusions, create illusion that's people believe are real.

912
00:43:36,999 --> 00:43:39,876
And reinforce them through media, amplification.

913
00:43:40,334 --> 00:43:42,292
Create distractions.

914
00:43:42,375 --> 00:43:43,999
Misdirection.

915
00:43:43,999 --> 00:43:44,999
Like a magician.

916
00:43:44,999 --> 00:43:49,125
If somebody sees something, it's there, but just make them look over here.

917
00:43:49,334 --> 00:43:52,167
Friend of mine who I met here works at NSA as contract employee looks

918
00:43:52,167 --> 00:43:54,709
for correlation between scandals among celebrities

919
00:43:54,709 --> 00:43:58,626
and important events that needed to be hidden in newspapers.

920
00:43:58,626 --> 00:44:01,083
He found a better than chance correlation.

921
00:44:01,375 --> 00:44:03,083
It troubled him.

922
00:44:03,083 --> 00:44:05,999
Why was Paris Hilton let out of jail early?

923
00:44:06,501 --> 00:44:09,999
Then he looked and found something about Iraq on Page 22.

924
00:44:10,292 --> 00:44:11,959
Paris Hilton was the headline.

925
00:44:11,959 --> 00:44:13,667
It's not that simple and that easy.

926
00:44:13,709 --> 00:44:18,417
But the media is complicit at best or worst cooperative at best,

927
00:44:18,417 --> 00:44:22,584
complicit at worst in amplifying whatever it needs

928
00:44:22,584 --> 00:44:25,751
to amplify according to the people who

929
00:44:25,751 --> 00:44:27,834
feed stories.

930
00:44:27,834 --> 00:44:29,083
That's a whole other talk that I'd love to do sometime

931
00:44:29,083 --> 00:44:32,375
on how we appointed ourselves the ministry of culture.

932
00:44:32,375 --> 00:44:33,375
The CIA did.

933
00:44:33,375 --> 00:44:34,834
In the 50s and 60s.

934
00:44:34,834 --> 00:44:36,584
And what they did around he world with the wholesale creation

935
00:44:36,584 --> 00:44:39,209
of newspapers, magazines and periodicals.

936
00:44:42,083 --> 00:44:43,999
In order to make (inaudible) then repeated

937
00:44:43,999 --> 00:44:47,417
by other magazines which they also influenced or owned.

938
00:44:47,834 --> 00:44:49,999
Things are not what they seem.

939
00:44:49,999 --> 00:44:51,751
They really are not what they seem.

940
00:44:51,751 --> 00:44:53,292
And that too is documented.

941
00:44:53,292 --> 00:44:54,542
Other cases continued.

942
00:44:54,542 --> 00:44:55,999
I refer to you the Tehran case.

943
00:44:55,999 --> 00:44:57,959
We have a document from the intelligence action describing

944
00:44:57,959 --> 00:44:59,501
the dog fight.

945
00:44:59,501 --> 00:45:01,292
It is fascinating reading.

946
00:45:01,292 --> 00:45:04,918
The big Alaska airship is also fascinating.

947
00:45:04,918 --> 00:45:07,876
You are about to tell me I'm almost done.

948
00:45:08,375 --> 00:45:10,292
(Laughter).

949
00:45:10,292 --> 00:45:11,292
Okay.

950
00:45:11,417 --> 00:45:13,334
It's recommended for university libraries

951
00:45:13,334 --> 00:45:15,999
because it's an exception.

952
00:45:15,999 --> 00:45:18,792
A thousand citations, 600 pages.

953
00:45:18,792 --> 00:45:20,999
The history of the government's response.

954
00:45:20,999 --> 00:45:23,334
We don't say anything about aliens or origins.

955
00:45:23,334 --> 00:45:25,751
But we do think you are smart.

956
00:45:25,751 --> 00:45:28,501
And if you see the nose of a camel inside your tent,

957
00:45:28,501 --> 00:45:33,083
guess what might be attached to it outside the tent?

958
00:45:33,209 --> 00:45:39,876
Read this book and other credible work which is referred to on my website.

959
00:45:39,876 --> 00:45:42,542
If you are interested in seeing the book or purchasing one, come

960
00:45:42,542 --> 00:45:45,083
to the book signing over in the book vendor space

961
00:45:45,083 --> 00:45:47,125
at Break Point Books.

962
00:45:47,375 --> 00:45:49,417
And take a look at the book.

963
00:45:49,417 --> 00:45:54,501
And we're not doing Q & A rooms anymore but I have business cards.

964
00:45:54,501 --> 00:45:55,584
