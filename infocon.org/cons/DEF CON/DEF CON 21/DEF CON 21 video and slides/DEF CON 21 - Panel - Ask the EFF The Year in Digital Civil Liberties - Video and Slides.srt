1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,999
KURT OPSAHL: All right, thank you, everybody, for coming

2
00:00:02,999 --> 00:00:05,167
to the Ask The EFF Panel.

3
00:00:05,167 --> 00:00:06,542
It's so great to see so many people here filling

4
00:00:06,542 --> 00:00:08,042
up this room.

5
00:00:08,542 --> 00:00:11,999
We are the Electronic Frontier Foundation.

6
00:00:14,792 --> 00:00:16,999
(Cheers and applause.)    KURT OPSAHL:

7
00:00:16,999 --> 00:00:18,626
Thank you.

8
00:00:21,375 --> 00:00:24,626
And so it's a pleasure to come here to DEF CON.

9
00:00:24,626 --> 00:00:26,999
There's so many people who have been great supporters of us here

10
00:00:26,999 --> 00:00:30,959
and so many people doing interesting things that lead to interesting issues,

11
00:00:30,959 --> 00:00:34,417
trying to help make the world a better place and we really also enjoy

12
00:00:34,417 --> 00:00:37,751
helping defend the people in this community.

13
00:00:37,999 --> 00:00:39,375
No arrests so far.

14
00:00:39,375 --> 00:00:42,167
We're going to hope for that for the rest of the weekend.

15
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:46,834
I'm Kurt Opsahl, one of the attorneys at the Electronic Frontier Foundation.

16
00:00:46,876 --> 00:00:49,125
I do work on the coders' rights project, designed to try

17
00:00:49,125 --> 00:00:52,999
to make sure that people understand what their legal risks are when doing

18
00:00:52,999 --> 00:00:55,999
security research and talking about it.

19
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:58,999
I also work on some of our other stuff.

20
00:00:58,999 --> 00:01:01,999
What I will be talking about a bit is the NSA surveillance and some

21
00:01:01,999 --> 00:01:06,542
of the recent revelations and what the EFF is doing about it.

22
00:01:06,542 --> 00:01:09,667
What we are going to do is go down the line here where each of us

23
00:01:09,667 --> 00:01:13,918
will talk a little bit about some of the projects that we are doing

24
00:01:13,918 --> 00:01:16,417
and introduce themselves.

25
00:01:16,834 --> 00:01:20,083
Then after we have that sort of brief introduction we are going

26
00:01:20,083 --> 00:01:24,083
to turn it over to you to bring up your questions.

27
00:01:24,167 --> 00:01:26,999
There is a microphone over on this side.

28
00:01:27,125 --> 00:01:30,999
So if you have questions you can just line-up in front of that microphone

29
00:01:30,999 --> 00:01:32,751
and ask them.

30
00:01:32,834 --> 00:01:36,083
A couple of things I want to say about the kind of questions.

31
00:01:36,083 --> 00:01:38,999
We are happy to talk about a lot of the legal and policy issues,

32
00:01:38,999 --> 00:01:42,792
the technology products and such, but this is not the forum to ask

33
00:01:42,792 --> 00:01:44,751
for legal advice.

34
00:01:44,751 --> 00:01:47,334
(Laughter.)    KURT OPSAHL: We do provide legal advice to people

35
00:01:47,334 --> 00:01:50,876
but that's best done in a confidential setting.

36
00:01:51,083 --> 00:01:54,250
This is not only not confidential because of all you fine people here,

37
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:57,292
it's also being recorded for posterity.

38
00:01:57,417 --> 00:02:01,876
It is not the right place for asking, here, I did this thing last night.

39
00:02:01,876 --> 00:02:02,876
Was that legal?

40
00:02:05,292 --> 00:02:07,250
(Laughter.)    KURT OPSAHL: All right.

41
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:10,501
So let me just begin with just one of the things that EFF is working

42
00:02:10,501 --> 00:02:13,375
on that I have been part of.

43
00:02:13,542 --> 00:02:18,542
And that is about the NSA warrantless surveillance program.

44
00:02:18,542 --> 00:02:18,999
It has been in the news lately and some

45
00:02:18,999 --> 00:02:20,999
of you may have read about it.

46
00:02:21,709 --> 00:02:26,375
And we have actually been working on these issues for quite a long time.

47
00:02:26,375 --> 00:02:28,999
In 2005 the New York Times published some reports

48
00:02:28,999 --> 00:02:33,459
about a warrantless surveillance program that was re-branded

49
00:02:33,459 --> 00:02:38,209
by the bush administration as the terrorist surveillance program,

50
00:02:38,209 --> 00:02:40,959
at least part of that.

51
00:02:40,999 --> 00:02:43,959
The following year the USA today published reports

52
00:02:43,959 --> 00:02:46,999
about a program to get the call detail records

53
00:02:46,999 --> 00:02:50,709
from various telecommunications companies.

54
00:02:51,083 --> 00:02:54,751
We have actually from based on the information that we learned

55
00:02:54,751 --> 00:02:57,918
at that time a case that we brought representing

56
00:02:57,918 --> 00:03:01,959
some people against the NSA and the government to try and stop

57
00:03:01,959 --> 00:03:05,584
the surveillance called jewel versus NSA.

58
00:03:05,584 --> 00:03:08,209
That has been going on in the courts for years now.

59
00:03:08,999 --> 00:03:12,459
But we have recently had a little bit of good news there which I will get

60
00:03:12,459 --> 00:03:14,125
to in a second.

61
00:03:14,125 --> 00:03:16,584
I want to say the second case that was brought

62
00:03:16,584 --> 00:03:21,876
about last month, and that was first Unitarian versus NSA.

63
00:03:22,083 --> 00:03:25,209
So in the jewel case the government put forward

64
00:03:25,209 --> 00:03:27,999
the State secret privilege.

65
00:03:27,999 --> 00:03:29,834
They said hey, this has got some secrets

66
00:03:29,834 --> 00:03:33,709
to it that prevent it from being litigated.

67
00:03:33,999 --> 00:03:37,999
And so we can't allow this case to go forward.

68
00:03:37,999 --> 00:03:41,125
They brought up a number of other defenses.

69
00:03:41,125 --> 00:03:43,999
What we have said is that under the Foreign Intelligence

70
00:03:43,999 --> 00:03:46,542
Surveillance Act there is a procedure set

71
00:03:46,542 --> 00:03:49,501
out by Congress after the Church Commission found

72
00:03:49,501 --> 00:03:52,999
a whole bunch of misuse of surveillance powers to determine

73
00:03:52,999 --> 00:03:56,999
the legality, have a court rule about whether what they are doing

74
00:03:56,999 --> 00:03:59,083
is or is not legal.

75
00:03:59,083 --> 00:04:03,918
That's the procedure that trumps the State secret privilege.

76
00:04:03,918 --> 00:04:07,125
So this case has gone up and down in the courts.

77
00:04:07,125 --> 00:04:10,626
It went, we lost an initial round.

78
00:04:10,626 --> 00:04:11,999
Went up to the appeals court.

79
00:04:11,999 --> 00:04:12,999
Won the appeal.

80
00:04:12,999 --> 00:04:14,999
Went back down to the District Court.

81
00:04:14,999 --> 00:04:19,834
Last month the District Court said the case can go forward.

82
00:04:19,999 --> 00:04:23,999
Go through this under the Foreign Intelligence

83
00:04:23,999 --> 00:04:26,542
Surveillance Act.

84
00:04:26,999 --> 00:04:28,999
So that case is ongoing.

85
00:04:29,125 --> 00:04:31,083
We are going to see whether the next move

86
00:04:31,083 --> 00:04:34,334
from the government is to appeal that or to move forward

87
00:04:34,334 --> 00:04:36,709
in the District Court.

88
00:04:36,709 --> 00:04:39,417
After some of the more recent revelations that have

89
00:04:39,417 --> 00:04:43,083
confirmed a lot of the stuff that we had seen before,

90
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:46,209
but provided something special.

91
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:48,501
I assume that most people here have been paying a fair amount

92
00:04:48,501 --> 00:04:50,626
of attention to some of the stuff that has come

93
00:04:50,626 --> 00:04:52,501
out in the guardian.

94
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:57,083
One of the things that came out was a copy of an order that was

95
00:04:57,083 --> 00:05:01,542
for Verizon to hand overall of the records.

96
00:05:01,667 --> 00:05:04,125
This was the call detail record.

97
00:05:04,125 --> 00:05:09,250
This is who you called, how long you spoke, and so the time

98
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:11,542
of the call.

99
00:05:11,834 --> 00:05:14,083
And it was for all of them.

100
00:05:14,083 --> 00:05:17,999
Not just, you know, one and foreign and not purely foreign but also

101
00:05:17,999 --> 00:05:20,501
down to local calls.

102
00:05:20,501 --> 00:05:23,999
On a daily basis they were to turn over to the FBI to hand

103
00:05:23,999 --> 00:05:28,999
over to the NSA or more or less directly to the NSA this database,

104
00:05:28,999 --> 00:05:32,709
the previous day's calls and then it would be added

105
00:05:32,709 --> 00:05:36,999
into the pool for analysis of contact chains.

106
00:05:36,999 --> 00:05:39,501
Basically this is kind of taking the metadata -- the government

107
00:05:39,501 --> 00:05:42,709
will say it's just metadata, not a big deal.

108
00:05:42,876 --> 00:05:44,542
But metadata is a big deal.

109
00:05:44,542 --> 00:05:47,792
It says who you call and that can reveal a tremendous amount

110
00:05:47,792 --> 00:05:50,999
about your relationship, reveal a tremendous amount

111
00:05:50,999 --> 00:05:55,375
about you if you are, you know, all of a sudden you're making a lot

112
00:05:55,375 --> 00:05:57,834
of calls to a doctor.

113
00:05:57,834 --> 00:06:00,334
That says something about your health situation.

114
00:06:00,334 --> 00:06:03,292
If you are calling certain representatives or political groups,

115
00:06:03,292 --> 00:06:07,959
it may say something about your political affiliation.

116
00:06:07,959 --> 00:06:10,834
There is a lot that it says about you than doesn't require them

117
00:06:10,834 --> 00:06:13,999
to listen to the content of the call.

118
00:06:14,667 --> 00:06:17,834
So this is very important information, very sensitive.

119
00:06:18,083 --> 00:06:21,959
The new case we filed last month, first Unitarian versus NSA was

120
00:06:21,959 --> 00:06:24,999
a collection of 18 different political advocacy

121
00:06:24,999 --> 00:06:29,501
organizations, church groups, people who have a right of association,

122
00:06:29,501 --> 00:06:33,501
a right to get together with other people who are like-minded

123
00:06:33,501 --> 00:06:36,083
and try to act together.

124
00:06:36,083 --> 00:06:37,292
This comes under the First Amendment, where

125
00:06:37,292 --> 00:06:39,999
a lot of the other litigation about the NSA has been

126
00:06:39,999 --> 00:06:42,459
under the Fourth Amendment.

127
00:06:43,209 --> 00:06:46,999
Because that's exactly what the call detail record program is about,

128
00:06:46,999 --> 00:06:49,999
trying to find out what the associations are and cases have

129
00:06:49,999 --> 00:06:53,792
found that indeed that is a First Amendment right.

130
00:06:53,792 --> 00:06:55,999
You can organize, get together with like-minded people, try

131
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:58,999
to do collective action without the government knowing

132
00:06:58,999 --> 00:07:01,999
everybody you are connecting with.

133
00:07:02,083 --> 00:07:05,417
That case was filed last month, just in the beginning phases.

134
00:07:05,417 --> 00:07:07,792
We are moving forward on a new angle.

135
00:07:07,792 --> 00:07:09,959
That's a very brief summary on some of what we are doing

136
00:07:09,959 --> 00:07:13,459
on the NSA front and with that I'll turn it over to Eva.

137
00:07:13,459 --> 00:07:16,626
EVA GALPERIN: Hi, my name is Eva Galperin,

138
00:07:16,626 --> 00:07:23,334
a global policy analyst for the Electronic Frontier Foundation.

139
00:07:23,334 --> 00:07:27,083
I understand that those are three words that can mean just about anything.

140
00:07:27,083 --> 00:07:29,834
I work on EFF's international team.

141
00:07:29,834 --> 00:07:31,834
There are five of us.

142
00:07:32,542 --> 00:07:35,501
EFF is a relatively small organization.

143
00:07:35,501 --> 00:07:39,125
We have a reasonably large number of lawyers who specialize

144
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:43,167
in litigation within the United States.

145
00:07:43,167 --> 00:07:45,667
But in the meantime, the Internet is global.

146
00:07:45,751 --> 00:07:46,918
So are we.

147
00:07:46,918 --> 00:07:50,292
So it's up to the international team to cover the rest of the world.

148
00:07:50,375 --> 00:07:52,334
So that's a little exhausting.

149
00:07:52,334 --> 00:07:55,083
(Laughter.)    EVA GALPERIN: In some of these places rule of law

150
00:07:55,083 --> 00:07:57,209
is relatively strong.

151
00:07:57,209 --> 00:08:02,626
So we can pursue our protection of the Internet through policy venues.

152
00:08:02,999 --> 00:08:05,542
We can fight bad laws.

153
00:08:05,542 --> 00:08:07,999
We can go to the European parliament.

154
00:08:07,999 --> 00:08:12,999
We can fight secret trade treaties like TPP and acta in a policy space,

155
00:08:12,999 --> 00:08:17,999
but a lot of my favorite work happens in countries or working

156
00:08:17,999 --> 00:08:22,667
with people who are located in people where the rule of law

157
00:08:22,667 --> 00:08:27,876
is even less strong than it is in the United States.

158
00:08:27,999 --> 00:08:32,375
You really cannot pursue the goal of Internet freedom

159
00:08:32,375 --> 00:08:35,167
through policy venues.

160
00:08:35,167 --> 00:08:38,292
Instead you have to go through a sort of process

161
00:08:38,292 --> 00:08:44,626
of helping users to protect themselves, often using technical tools.

162
00:08:44,626 --> 00:08:46,999
I spend a lot of time talking to journalists,

163
00:08:46,999 --> 00:08:51,501
especially independent journalists in countries where the act

164
00:08:51,501 --> 00:08:54,584
of journalism is almost indistinguishable

165
00:08:54,584 --> 00:08:56,626
from activism.

166
00:08:56,999 --> 00:09:02,999
Having your opinion and publishing it about the news is an act of activism

167
00:09:02,999 --> 00:09:05,626
in many countries.

168
00:09:05,959 --> 00:09:12,834
I talk to a lot of terrified journalists and a lot of terrified activists.

169
00:09:12,876 --> 00:09:15,125
Sometimes difficult to tell the difference.

170
00:09:15,167 --> 00:09:16,834
I spend a lot of time advising them

171
00:09:16,834 --> 00:09:19,751
about best practices for protecting their security

172
00:09:19,751 --> 00:09:22,999
and privacy and talking about their rights as they travel

173
00:09:22,999 --> 00:09:27,334
around and try to publish the information that they have.

174
00:09:27,834 --> 00:09:30,751
So in a lot of ways I rely on you guys because the only way

175
00:09:30,751 --> 00:09:34,999
to really understand best practices is to understand what the threats are

176
00:09:34,999 --> 00:09:39,292
on the Internet right now and what kind of threat models people are looking

177
00:09:39,292 --> 00:09:42,626
at and what both governments and individuals are capable

178
00:09:42,626 --> 00:09:45,876
of doing when it comes to compromising people's privacy

179
00:09:45,876 --> 00:09:47,584
and security.

180
00:09:47,709 --> 00:09:51,709
I follow the hacker community very, very closely.

181
00:09:51,834 --> 00:09:54,999
This is my seventh DEF CON.

182
00:09:55,334 --> 00:09:56,417
Not in a row.

183
00:09:56,417 --> 00:09:59,125
The first one I attended was 1998.

184
00:09:59,375 --> 00:10:01,334
It was a much smaller room.

185
00:10:01,334 --> 00:10:03,999
(Chuckles.)    EVA GALPERIN: So one of the things I wanted to talk

186
00:10:03,999 --> 00:10:06,876
about really quick was while most of the people here are going

187
00:10:06,876 --> 00:10:10,000
to be talking about what they can do for you, I will talk a little bit

188
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,459
about what you can do for me.

189
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:19,751
The biggest project that I was working on last year was the project

190
00:10:19,751 --> 00:10:26,834
in which we were finding documenting, reverse engineering and then writing

191
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:33,334
up the reports on Syrian malware, forces against President Assad were

192
00:10:33,334 --> 00:10:37,999
spying on activists throughout Syria.

193
00:10:39,918 --> 00:10:44,292
Even if you're using encryption, they would surreptitiously install

194
00:10:44,292 --> 00:10:47,542
a root kit on your machine, therefore by passing

195
00:10:47,542 --> 00:10:52,459
all of your precious encryption and all of the good advice I can possibly

196
00:10:52,459 --> 00:10:55,042
give to Syrian activists.

197
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:58,584
We tracked down the malware, reverse engineering it and writing

198
00:10:58,584 --> 00:11:00,292
up the reports.

199
00:11:00,292 --> 00:11:03,209
We had the reports translated into Arabic.

200
00:11:03,209 --> 00:11:04,709
There's no point in writing them if they can't be read

201
00:11:04,709 --> 00:11:06,999
by the people who are targeted.

202
00:11:09,083 --> 00:11:12,751
This was actually very successful.

203
00:11:12,751 --> 00:11:15,250
And as a result, I have terrified activists coming

204
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:18,999
to me with more malware from all over the world, places

205
00:11:18,999 --> 00:11:23,375
like Ethiopia and Vietnam and occasionally China.

206
00:11:23,375 --> 00:11:25,667
There are a lot of reverse Chinese malware.

207
00:11:26,083 --> 00:11:29,417
I need a show of hands.

208
00:11:29,417 --> 00:11:30,999
Anybody here reverse malware?

209
00:11:31,125 --> 00:11:32,125
Anybody?

210
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:33,125
Anybody?

211
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:34,125
I see some hands.

212
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:35,459
I need you all.

213
00:11:35,834 --> 00:11:36,999
And over there.

214
00:11:37,999 --> 00:11:41,999
I need you all to come talk to me after this talk

215
00:11:41,999 --> 00:11:48,083
because I have more terrifying malware than I have reversers.

216
00:11:48,584 --> 00:11:51,918
This is where I go to pick up more reversers.

217
00:11:51,999 --> 00:11:55,709
(Laughter.)    EVA GALPERIN: I desperately need your help.

218
00:11:56,417 --> 00:12:00,209
I am here to answer questions about anything involving the rest

219
00:12:00,209 --> 00:12:01,999
of the world.

220
00:12:03,334 --> 00:12:05,459
Julian Assange.

221
00:12:07,959 --> 00:12:13,417
EVA GALPERIN: Including Julian Assange, Edward Snowden, ACTA,

222
00:12:13,417 --> 00:12:18,501
TPP, China, Iran, all kinds of terrible malware gamma PHIN

223
00:12:18,501 --> 00:12:24,584
Phisher, United States selling to regimes in Turkmenistan.

224
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:27,250
That's what I do and if you have questions I'm happy

225
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:29,209
to answer them later.

226
00:12:29,501 --> 00:12:32,876
MARCIA HOFFMANN: Hi, there.

227
00:12:32,876 --> 00:12:34,542
My name is Marcia Hoffmann.

228
00:12:34,667 --> 00:12:39,709
I was a senior staff attorney at Electronic Frontier Foundation

229
00:12:39,709 --> 00:12:41,999
for a long time.

230
00:12:41,999 --> 00:12:43,292
I was there for seven years.

231
00:12:43,292 --> 00:12:47,125
I left just a couple months ago to start my own little private practice

232
00:12:47,125 --> 00:12:51,083
focused on technology law, very specifically privacy issues,

233
00:12:51,083 --> 00:12:54,667
copyright issues, hacking and security related things,

234
00:12:54,667 --> 00:12:56,375
free speech.

235
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:59,792
And I remain involved with the EFF as a fellow.

236
00:12:59,792 --> 00:13:03,125
That's why I'm on the panel today, I'm still an EFF fellow.

237
00:13:03,167 --> 00:13:05,999
And I also became an EFF member last night

238
00:13:05,999 --> 00:13:09,083
for the sole selfish purpose of getting

239
00:13:09,083 --> 00:13:13,999
the totally amazing rocking EFF DEF CON T-shirt.

240
00:13:13,999 --> 00:13:15,999
I don't know if you've seen the new one.

241
00:13:15,999 --> 00:13:17,542
Visit the booth and check it out.

242
00:13:17,542 --> 00:13:19,417
It's amazing, fantastic and I love it.

243
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:23,626
I wanted to talk to you today about a case I became involved

244
00:13:23,626 --> 00:13:28,834
in while I was still at EFF, but when I left I remained involved in it.

245
00:13:28,834 --> 00:13:30,167
EFF is also involved in it.

246
00:13:30,167 --> 00:13:31,417
We are partnering on it.

247
00:13:31,417 --> 00:13:32,918
It's a case some of you may have heard about,

248
00:13:32,918 --> 00:13:35,209
United States versus Auernheimer.

249
00:13:36,751 --> 00:13:39,125
Show of hands, how many people heard of this?

250
00:13:39,334 --> 00:13:43,999
You may know it as the Weev case or iPad hacker case.

251
00:13:43,999 --> 00:13:45,292
Does that ring any bells?

252
00:13:45,959 --> 00:13:49,083
So let me tell you what happened in this case.

253
00:13:49,334 --> 00:13:52,209
There is this guy named Daniel Spitler.

254
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:59,751
And he notices something interesting about iPads a few years ago.

255
00:13:59,876 --> 00:14:05,918
Specifically what he notices is that if a person has an iPad and wants

256
00:14:05,918 --> 00:14:11,334
to go set up adapt plan on that iPad, the person goes and visits

257
00:14:11,334 --> 00:14:16,375
the AT&T website using the browser on the iPad.

258
00:14:16,375 --> 00:14:18,083
And when they visit the browser, they see

259
00:14:18,083 --> 00:14:21,999
a pop-up window that has pre-populated in the pop-up window

260
00:14:21,999 --> 00:14:26,083
the account holder's e-mail address and then the account holder

261
00:14:26,083 --> 00:14:30,999
is supposed to type in the password to get into the account.

262
00:14:31,125 --> 00:14:35,959
He notices that when you see this pop-up window in the browser,

263
00:14:35,959 --> 00:14:39,167
in the URL there is a number.

264
00:14:39,167 --> 00:14:41,999
And he recognizes that this is an ICC ID which

265
00:14:41,999 --> 00:14:47,751
is a unique identifier associated with the SIM card of the iPad.

266
00:14:47,751 --> 00:14:51,417
Basically what was happening, AT&T servers were recognizing that

267
00:14:51,417 --> 00:14:55,999
this is this particular iPad, AT&T knows that this is, this iPad

268
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:59,918
is associated with this account holder.

269
00:14:59,918 --> 00:15:01,876
They pre-populate the e-mail address.

270
00:15:01,876 --> 00:15:03,709
He says oh, well, I wonder what happens

271
00:15:03,709 --> 00:15:06,083
if I change that number?

272
00:15:06,083 --> 00:15:07,459
What if I change one digit?

273
00:15:07,751 --> 00:15:09,999
Boom, there's a different e-mail address.

274
00:15:10,083 --> 00:15:14,167
And so he wrote a script that basically just iterated

275
00:15:14,167 --> 00:15:18,918
through the ICC IDs in the URL and managed to harvest

276
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:23,250
about 140,000 e-mail addresses this way.

277
00:15:23,834 --> 00:15:26,999
And then he, while he's in the process of doing this

278
00:15:26,999 --> 00:15:31,501
he goes online and he tells some of his friends there: Oh, my God,

279
00:15:31,501 --> 00:15:34,584
I just figured out that AT&T does this thing

280
00:15:34,584 --> 00:15:39,334
and I wrote this script and I'm harvesting this stuff.

281
00:15:39,999 --> 00:15:42,083
One of the people that he was speaking to about this

282
00:15:42,083 --> 00:15:45,459
is a guy named Andrew Auernheimer who is also known as Weev.

283
00:15:46,334 --> 00:15:48,501
Weev says we should see if in that list

284
00:15:48,501 --> 00:15:51,999
of e-mail addresses there are any reporters and we can tell them

285
00:15:51,999 --> 00:15:55,375
about this and maybe they'll write about it.

286
00:15:55,709 --> 00:15:59,083
They identify several reporters, including a gawker reporter.

287
00:15:59,542 --> 00:16:03,417
Weev sends them an e-mail and explains the situation, frankly

288
00:16:03,417 --> 00:16:07,542
in rather provocative terms to attract attention.

289
00:16:07,834 --> 00:16:11,083
Then gawker published a story about it.

290
00:16:11,542 --> 00:16:17,584
As opposed spiller and Weev were then indicted on two felony counts each,

291
00:16:17,584 --> 00:16:21,918
conspiracy to violate the federal Computer Fraud

292
00:16:21,918 --> 00:16:25,876
and Abuse Act and identity theft.

293
00:16:26,626 --> 00:16:29,292
Basically the government's argument

294
00:16:29,292 --> 00:16:34,167
for the violation, the conspiracy to violate the Computer Fraud

295
00:16:34,167 --> 00:16:38,083
and Abuse Act is that Spitler's script, his access

296
00:16:38,083 --> 00:16:41,834
to AT&T servers amounted to unauthorized access

297
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:44,584
to protected computers.

298
00:16:44,999 --> 00:16:49,250
And I think that this is a really concerning interpretation

299
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:53,999
of the law because this is information that AT&T published

300
00:16:53,999 --> 00:16:56,209
on the Internet.

301
00:16:56,209 --> 00:16:58,999
It was hidden, but there was no barrier in place

302
00:16:58,999 --> 00:17:01,999
to protect that information.

303
00:17:01,999 --> 00:17:03,083
There was no password.

304
00:17:03,083 --> 00:17:04,083
There was nothing.

305
00:17:04,083 --> 00:17:07,834
AT&T basically just hoped that people would never notice it was there.

306
00:17:08,334 --> 00:17:12,501
And so what ended up happening was, Spitler cooperated

307
00:17:12,501 --> 00:17:16,083
with the government, testified against Weev and

308
00:17:16,083 --> 00:17:20,209
in November -- Weev and in November Weev was convicted

309
00:17:20,209 --> 00:17:25,375
on two felony counts, sentenced to three and a half years in prison

310
00:17:25,375 --> 00:17:29,250
and to pay AT&T $73,000 to compensate them for what

311
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:33,626
they needed to do to rectify the situation.

312
00:17:34,459 --> 00:17:37,334
We are in the midst of appealing this case.

313
00:17:37,999 --> 00:17:40,167
EFF is on it.

314
00:17:40,167 --> 00:17:42,125
I'm continuing to work on it pro bono.

315
00:17:42,334 --> 00:17:47,959
We are joined by Orin Kerr, a respected crime counsel.

316
00:17:50,999 --> 00:17:56,292
And we are partnering to appeal this to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals.

317
00:17:56,292 --> 00:17:59,167
We filed our opening brief in July, July 1st and

318
00:17:59,167 --> 00:18:05,250
the government's opposition will be filed in just a couple of weeks.

319
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:08,918
And so that's kind of the deal with that case.

320
00:18:09,083 --> 00:18:11,999
If you have questions about it, of course I will be happy to discuss

321
00:18:11,999 --> 00:18:14,083
or any number of other things that you want

322
00:18:14,083 --> 00:18:15,959
to talk about.

323
00:18:15,959 --> 00:18:16,959
Thank you.

324
00:18:22,999 --> 00:18:26,667
(Applause.)    MITCH STOLTZ: Hi, I'm Mitch Stoltz, an attorney at EFF

325
00:18:26,667 --> 00:18:29,375
in the intellectual property team.

326
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:33,501
I apologize in advance of the effect of a very old kind of malware known

327
00:18:33,501 --> 00:18:35,459
as ahead cold.

328
00:18:35,999 --> 00:18:36,999
Bear with me.

329
00:18:36,999 --> 00:18:38,083
I'll keep this brief.

330
00:18:38,542 --> 00:18:41,876
I work on cases where intellectual property

331
00:18:41,876 --> 00:18:47,626
laws like copyright, patent, although I'm less of a patent expert,

332
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:53,626
and some other random laws interfere with freedom of speech, freedom

333
00:18:53,626 --> 00:18:56,999
to build, freedom to tinker.

334
00:18:57,167 --> 00:19:00,751
And I'll just quickly mention two things that are, you know,

335
00:19:00,751 --> 00:19:04,918
probably really current issues and probably of interest to some

336
00:19:04,918 --> 00:19:07,083
of the people here.

337
00:19:07,751 --> 00:19:10,999
One is the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.

338
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:13,459
This was a law passed 15 years ago.

339
00:19:13,876 --> 00:19:21,250
Part of it is a federal civil and criminal ban on breaking what

340
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:27,083
is commonly known as DRM, digital access controls

341
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:30,667
on copyrighted works.

342
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:37,417
For the start, we think it was a bad premise

343
00:19:37,417 --> 00:19:43,999
because with a few generally not that useful exceptions it is illegal

344
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:47,751
to break DRM even if you are breaking it

345
00:19:47,751 --> 00:19:51,626
for an otherwise legal purpose.

346
00:19:51,999 --> 00:19:55,999
Now, there are some exceptions, but those exceptions are hard to use,

347
00:19:55,999 --> 00:19:57,999
for the most part.

348
00:19:57,999 --> 00:20:00,999
They protect certain people and not others.

349
00:20:00,999 --> 00:20:03,334
And there is a process where the Library

350
00:20:03,334 --> 00:20:08,918
of Congress can pass new exceptions every three years.

351
00:20:08,918 --> 00:20:11,751
The problem with those is they are generally very narrow

352
00:20:11,751 --> 00:20:14,876
and they only last three years.

353
00:20:15,042 --> 00:20:19,375
What happened this year, a couple of things that were interesting.

354
00:20:19,375 --> 00:20:28,999
In the last three-year cycle which was 2009 to -- beginning of 2009,

355
00:20:28,999 --> 00:20:40,167
EFF asked for and got an exemption for jail breaking smart phones.

356
00:20:40,167 --> 00:20:45,751
A declaration of shield against lawsuits for people who want

357
00:20:45,751 --> 00:20:51,999
to install unapproved apps on a mobile phone device.

358
00:20:55,584 --> 00:21:00,083
At the time there was another group, actually this was EFF

359
00:21:00,083 --> 00:21:04,667
at the time who also got an exemption for unlocking, that

360
00:21:04,667 --> 00:21:10,375
is for modifying a smart phone to use it on a different wireless network,

361
00:21:10,375 --> 00:21:13,542
different cellular network.

362
00:21:14,792 --> 00:21:17,918
What happened this year, we successfully renewed

363
00:21:17,918 --> 00:21:21,542
the exemption, I'm sorry, in 2012 we successfully renewed

364
00:21:21,542 --> 00:21:24,667
the exemption for jail breaking, but the Library

365
00:21:24,667 --> 00:21:29,626
of Congress decided not to renew the exemption for unlocking.

366
00:21:29,626 --> 00:21:33,792
This was really strange to a lot of people and the way it was reported

367
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:36,999
in the press mostly accurately was the librarian

368
00:21:36,999 --> 00:21:43,083
of Congress says that unlocking your phone to switch carriers is now illegal.

369
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:46,250
Maybe not true exactly.

370
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:48,083
A couple of courts have gone one way.

371
00:21:48,083 --> 00:21:50,209
A couple of courts have gone the other way.

372
00:21:50,209 --> 00:21:52,125
There is no connection to protecting copyrighted works here,

373
00:21:52,125 --> 00:21:56,334
which is arguably what this law was supposed to do.

374
00:21:57,083 --> 00:22:00,125
But some of the major cellular networks,

375
00:22:00,125 --> 00:22:04,626
cellular carriers have claimed and continue to claim that

376
00:22:04,626 --> 00:22:08,125
if you unlock your phone or if you hire someone

377
00:22:08,125 --> 00:22:12,083
to unlock your phone without their permission, that

378
00:22:12,083 --> 00:22:17,999
they can sue you and that there may even be criminal penalties.

379
00:22:17,999 --> 00:22:21,459
This is separate and apart from your contract.

380
00:22:23,626 --> 00:22:25,999
Obviously you break a contract, usually you have to pay

381
00:22:25,999 --> 00:22:28,292
an early termination penalty.

382
00:22:28,292 --> 00:22:30,709
This is something everybody understands.

383
00:22:30,709 --> 00:22:34,999
It's a bargain that you make when you sign up for mobile phone service.

384
00:22:34,999 --> 00:22:36,999
This is on top of that.

385
00:22:37,292 --> 00:22:41,334
The claim that because of this law that was supposed

386
00:22:41,334 --> 00:22:46,083
to protect and restrict, for example, the encryption on DVDs,

387
00:22:46,083 --> 00:22:49,667
because of that law you can't change carriers

388
00:22:49,667 --> 00:22:53,876
without the current carrier's permission.

389
00:22:54,792 --> 00:22:57,209
All really fairly ridiculous.

390
00:22:57,751 --> 00:23:02,292
There's a bill going through Congress just passed

391
00:23:02,292 --> 00:23:06,999
out of a House committee last week, that would fix

392
00:23:06,999 --> 00:23:13,083
in a very narrow way this specific problem about phone unlocking,

393
00:23:13,083 --> 00:23:17,999
but only for the next two years and without getting

394
00:23:17,999 --> 00:23:24,125
at the deeper problem, which is this law is used as a club to stop

395
00:23:24,125 --> 00:23:28,542
and punish lots of things that could be called

396
00:23:28,542 --> 00:23:33,125
circumventing a digital access control.

397
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:39,999
Going beyond, just protection of copyrighted material, movies,

398
00:23:39,999 --> 00:23:45,459
music and so on, books, to really being a yet another kind

399
00:23:45,459 --> 00:23:48,292
of anti-hacking law.

400
00:23:48,417 --> 00:23:52,999
It gets used as a club.

401
00:23:54,999 --> 00:23:59,083
You know, we are looking for ways to hopefully get Congress

402
00:23:59,083 --> 00:24:03,709
to fix this law in a more really comprehensive way.

403
00:24:03,709 --> 00:24:07,999
In the meantime we continue to ask the Library of Congress for exemptions.

404
00:24:09,083 --> 00:24:13,250
We respect interested in hearing people's stories

405
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:18,083
about how they, and under what circumstances do you need

406
00:24:18,083 --> 00:24:23,876
to circumvent or undo or avoid digital access controls?

407
00:24:25,292 --> 00:24:28,083
If you've ever been legally threatened for those things,

408
00:24:28,083 --> 00:24:30,584
those are things we would be interested in hearing

409
00:24:30,584 --> 00:24:33,292
about in private and confidentially.

410
00:24:34,709 --> 00:24:38,375
Or if you have thoughts about that law.

411
00:24:39,334 --> 00:24:43,209
The other area that I'll mention briefly is patent trolls, which has been

412
00:24:43,209 --> 00:24:47,125
a really big area for us this year and for the country.

413
00:24:47,334 --> 00:24:51,167
We've seen really strong statements out of the White House, a lot

414
00:24:51,167 --> 00:24:54,250
of sectors of the digital technology economies

415
00:24:54,250 --> 00:24:56,667
about patent trolls.

416
00:24:56,667 --> 00:24:57,918
What are patent trolls?

417
00:24:57,959 --> 00:25:00,999
There is not a really widely accepted definition,

418
00:25:00,999 --> 00:25:06,083
but generally speaking we are talking about companies that don't build

419
00:25:06,083 --> 00:25:08,999
or produce or sell things.

420
00:25:08,999 --> 00:25:10,876
They simply own patents.

421
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:20,999
They simply own patents and sue over them.

422
00:25:21,626 --> 00:25:25,334
The really damaging ones are in the information technology space,

423
00:25:25,334 --> 00:25:27,709
in the Internet space.

424
00:25:27,876 --> 00:25:29,125
For example, recently there's

425
00:25:29,125 --> 00:25:32,083
a company that has been threatening bloggers

426
00:25:32,083 --> 00:25:35,999
with patent infringement lawsuits because they claim to own

427
00:25:35,999 --> 00:25:41,334
a patent that covers some really basic aspects of Web publishing.

428
00:25:41,334 --> 00:25:44,792
Things that have really been done for over a decade.

429
00:25:49,751 --> 00:25:55,999
The other one recently -- it will come to me.

430
00:25:55,999 --> 00:25:59,876
There's a number of things being done, a number of things that EFF is doing.

431
00:25:59,876 --> 00:26:02,083
We launched a site called trolleffects.org.

432
00:26:02,083 --> 00:26:05,584
We are collecting threaten letters that people have received

433
00:26:05,584 --> 00:26:11,167
from patent trolls or likely patent trolls and see if we can develop a picture

434
00:26:11,167 --> 00:26:16,250
of who is doing this, what patents do they actually own.

435
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:18,709
It's hard to tell who owns what because they tend

436
00:26:18,709 --> 00:26:22,334
to use shell companies and false identities when they send

437
00:26:22,334 --> 00:26:24,999
the threatening letters.

438
00:26:25,999 --> 00:26:31,167
If people send them to trolleffects.org we can hopefully get

439
00:26:31,167 --> 00:26:34,999
a picture of who is doing what.

440
00:26:34,999 --> 00:26:38,459
And it can be resource for people who get a threat letter,

441
00:26:38,459 --> 00:26:43,667
to figure out how legitimate it is, whether this is a company that

442
00:26:43,667 --> 00:26:47,501
is likely to sue, so on and so forth.

443
00:26:48,751 --> 00:26:53,999
So we would be interested in hearing from you how patents

444
00:26:53,999 --> 00:26:57,918
on software, patents on protocols, patents

445
00:26:57,918 --> 00:27:04,459
on communications technologies, et cetera, have affected you.

446
00:27:04,834 --> 00:27:06,542
I'll leave it at that.

447
00:27:06,542 --> 00:27:11,209
DAN AUERBACH: Hi, everyone.

448
00:27:11,209 --> 00:27:14,626
My name is Dan Auerbach, staff technologist at EFF.

449
00:27:14,626 --> 00:27:16,626
We have a staff of four technologists.

450
00:27:16,999 --> 00:27:19,125
Part of my job is to provide technical support

451
00:27:19,125 --> 00:27:22,876
for the organization in terms of if someone wants to know what

452
00:27:22,876 --> 00:27:27,417
is an IP address or how does network address translations work?

453
00:27:27,417 --> 00:27:31,292
Those sorts of questions, I give that information

454
00:27:31,292 --> 00:27:37,334
to our legal team and activism team and to journalists.

455
00:27:37,375 --> 00:27:42,792
But today I want to give an overview of the other aspect of what we work on.

456
00:27:42,792 --> 00:27:45,167
We have a bunch of tech projects.

457
00:27:46,459 --> 00:27:52,751
Kind of a theme of our tech projects is encrypting the Web.

458
00:27:52,834 --> 00:27:56,083
So this is kind of a mission that we have at EFF

459
00:27:56,083 --> 00:28:00,501
to try to encourage the adoption of https and the use of https

460
00:28:00,501 --> 00:28:02,999
as much as possible.

461
00:28:02,999 --> 00:28:07,918
We have been encouraged with recent news based on the leaks,

462
00:28:07,918 --> 00:28:13,209
the NSA leaks that encryption does seem to work.

463
00:28:13,209 --> 00:28:17,083
The NSA doesn't have some sort of magic ability to decrypt things.

464
00:28:17,292 --> 00:28:19,125
Which is great news.

465
00:28:19,417 --> 00:28:23,250
It means that we really need to deprecate http.

466
00:28:23,250 --> 00:28:29,417
We need http to become like Telenet, to what SHH is now.

467
00:28:33,667 --> 00:28:37,501
(Applause.)    DAN AUERBACH: So towards that end we have

468
00:28:37,501 --> 00:28:40,167
a project that we launched in 2010 which

469
00:28:40,167 --> 00:28:43,375
is called Https Everywhere, a browse extension

470
00:28:43,375 --> 00:28:45,999
for Chrome and Firefox.

471
00:28:45,999 --> 00:28:47,999
This is the most visible project.

472
00:28:47,999 --> 00:28:51,167
The way this works, there's a giant list

473
00:28:51,167 --> 00:28:57,292
of rules and your browser understands that some websites offer

474
00:28:57,292 --> 00:29:02,999
an https connection but don't do it by default.

475
00:29:02,999 --> 00:29:07,751
So Https Everywhere encrypts those connections.

476
00:29:10,999 --> 00:29:15,459
It recognizes this is, by default Wikipedia was over http,

477
00:29:15,459 --> 00:29:20,375
but with our add-on it would encrypt that traffic.

478
00:29:20,959 --> 00:29:25,083
That was kind of our first foray into this area.

479
00:29:25,334 --> 00:29:29,417
But then we started noticing, well, https is great, but PKI,

480
00:29:29,417 --> 00:29:34,834
public key infrastructure, the certificate authority system is really,

481
00:29:34,834 --> 00:29:37,709
seems really problematic.

482
00:29:37,834 --> 00:29:41,999
So what we did next was this project called the observatory,

483
00:29:41,999 --> 00:29:47,667
where we did a scan on port 443 of the entire IPV4 Internet and collected

484
00:29:47,667 --> 00:29:50,999
all the security certificates.

485
00:29:51,999 --> 00:29:56,709
And with that, we made a map of the existing certificate authorities

486
00:29:56,709 --> 00:30:00,042
and the relationships between them.

487
00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:05,083
Some certificate authorities are root and they are trusted in your browser.

488
00:30:05,083 --> 00:30:06,751
Others are intermediate.

489
00:30:06,751 --> 00:30:09,375
Some certificates can be cached by the browser even though

490
00:30:09,375 --> 00:30:12,083
they are not implicitly trusted.

491
00:30:12,626 --> 00:30:16,999
It's a messy world of how certificates are handled.

492
00:30:16,999 --> 00:30:19,876
For people who kind of follow this issue, it

493
00:30:19,876 --> 00:30:23,292
is well-known that PKI is pretty broken.

494
00:30:23,292 --> 00:30:25,000
That we need to fix it.

495
00:30:25,584 --> 00:30:27,959
But the observatory was kind of a tool that we tried to use

496
00:30:27,959 --> 00:30:29,999
to study this problem.

497
00:30:29,999 --> 00:30:33,999
We also have something called the decentralized observatory which

498
00:30:33,999 --> 00:30:37,542
for users on Firefox you can opt into sending us

499
00:30:37,542 --> 00:30:42,918
the certificates that you see as you browse around the Web.

500
00:30:43,250 --> 00:30:47,584
And so this is a way for us to detect attacks.

501
00:30:47,584 --> 00:30:50,042
So, for example, if your browser thinks that it

502
00:30:50,042 --> 00:30:54,751
is seeing a valid certificate for Google.com, but we notice, whoa,

503
00:30:54,751 --> 00:31:00,792
this is very different than a lot of the other certificates we're seeing.

504
00:31:00,792 --> 00:31:04,626
We will be able to warn the user about that.

505
00:31:04,626 --> 00:31:08,999
And we also will be able to kind of get some more information

506
00:31:08,999 --> 00:31:12,083
about how certificates vary from region

507
00:31:12,083 --> 00:31:18,834
to region and how Web servers generally deploy their SSL certificates.

508
00:31:19,250 --> 00:31:23,876
That's kind of some of our projects in the vein of encrypting the Web,

509
00:31:23,876 --> 00:31:27,792
but we also have other stuff we work on, too.

510
00:31:28,083 --> 00:31:32,999
Another area that we've been kind of investigating lately is the issue

511
00:31:32,999 --> 00:31:36,999
of nonconsensual tracking on the Web.

512
00:31:37,292 --> 00:31:39,999
So ten years ago when you visited a site like the New York Times,

513
00:31:39,999 --> 00:31:44,292
your browser loaded resources mostly just from the New York Times.

514
00:31:44,292 --> 00:31:48,083
Now if you inspect, when you load the New York Times

515
00:31:48,083 --> 00:31:53,709
and you open a debugger to see all the resources you're loading,

516
00:31:53,709 --> 00:31:58,999
it's from maybe dozens or hundreds of different companies, many

517
00:31:58,999 --> 00:32:03,542
of which are kind of invisible third-party trackers,

518
00:32:03,542 --> 00:32:08,626
which are amassing browsing histories of users.

519
00:32:08,999 --> 00:32:11,209
We think this is really bad.

520
00:32:11,209 --> 00:32:12,918
People don't know about it and it's happening more

521
00:32:12,918 --> 00:32:14,209
and more.

522
00:32:14,834 --> 00:32:18,542
There is an effort called do not track which was supposed

523
00:32:18,542 --> 00:32:21,709
to help mitigate this problem, but unfortunately

524
00:32:21,709 --> 00:32:25,250
the W3C tracking protection working group which I'm on,

525
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:27,959
has stalled quite a bit.

526
00:32:28,459 --> 00:32:32,375
And so users are left with a few different options.

527
00:32:32,375 --> 00:32:33,999
They can install an ad blocker which I'm sure many

528
00:32:33,999 --> 00:32:37,667
of the savvier people in this room have already done.

529
00:32:37,709 --> 00:32:41,959
But advertising does form a significant portion of revenue

530
00:32:41,959 --> 00:32:47,292
on the Web and we don't think that you should have to block all ads in order

531
00:32:47,292 --> 00:32:49,584
to stop tracking.

532
00:32:49,792 --> 00:32:53,918
So what we did is we are building a tool which is actually

533
00:32:53,918 --> 00:32:58,292
an experimental Chrome tension which you can download now called

534
00:32:58,292 --> 00:33:01,959
the EFF tracker blocking laboratory.

535
00:33:01,999 --> 00:33:05,999
So we thought we would add to the ecosystem of blockers by,

536
00:33:05,999 --> 00:33:10,292
instead of having a list based blocker -- most blockers

537
00:33:10,292 --> 00:33:14,584
today, if you use ad block plus or ghost tree, there's

538
00:33:14,584 --> 00:33:18,834
a manual list created in a central crawl.

539
00:33:18,834 --> 00:33:22,959
What we are doing is a heuristic based blocker.

540
00:33:22,999 --> 00:33:25,709
From within the blousier as you browse around,

541
00:33:25,709 --> 00:33:29,501
we notice this domain seems like it's tracking you and we block it

542
00:33:29,501 --> 00:33:31,250
based on that.

543
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:34,918
This is very experimental but it's a direction we are going to try

544
00:33:34,918 --> 00:33:39,584
to add to the ecosystem so that we can hopefully eventually land a feature

545
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:42,626
like this in browsers, so we can fight back more

546
00:33:42,626 --> 00:33:45,918
against the nonconsensual tracking.

547
00:33:47,083 --> 00:33:53,083
Finally we have a project to promote open wireless access.

548
00:33:53,999 --> 00:33:57,459
We are trying to make it easier for people

549
00:33:57,459 --> 00:34:03,501
to provide open wireless guest access with a deprioritized, it would start

550
00:34:03,501 --> 00:34:08,999
with the second wireless LAN that is deprioritized so your bandwidth

551
00:34:08,999 --> 00:34:11,292
is not affected.

552
00:34:11,292 --> 00:34:15,542
We are trying to figure out how to build security properties

553
00:34:15,542 --> 00:34:19,125
into that open wireless solution.

554
00:34:19,417 --> 00:34:21,709
It is actually the case that WPA2 doesn't provide

555
00:34:21,709 --> 00:34:25,542
much security, especially at a conference like this.

556
00:34:25,542 --> 00:34:26,083
It is essentially an open network

557
00:34:26,083 --> 00:34:28,709
because everyone has the password.

558
00:34:28,709 --> 00:34:31,959
We are looking at ways to get WPA2 kind of security

559
00:34:31,959 --> 00:34:34,083
for open networks.

560
00:34:34,334 --> 00:34:36,834
That's an overview of our tech projects.

561
00:34:36,834 --> 00:34:40,501
If you have questions about any of those I'm the guy to ask.

562
00:34:40,501 --> 00:34:41,501
Thank you.

563
00:34:47,918 --> 00:34:50,334
(Applause.)    MARC JAYCOX: Hi, everyone.

564
00:34:50,334 --> 00:34:51,999
I'm Marc Jaycox, a legislative assistant for EFF,

565
00:34:51,999 --> 00:34:54,999
working for the legal and activism teams.

566
00:34:55,501 --> 00:34:59,334
That involves working with, dealing with Congress and legislation

567
00:34:59,334 --> 00:35:04,375
and also blogging, helping run coalitions, things like that.

568
00:35:04,626 --> 00:35:06,834
I'm going to give probably a quick overview of my year

569
00:35:06,834 --> 00:35:10,876
with what we have been doing and what we have been working on.

570
00:35:10,999 --> 00:35:13,792
And so the year kind of started off with CISPA,

571
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:17,959
Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act.

572
00:35:17,999 --> 00:35:22,999
Before the leaks, this was a law that granted broad legal immunity

573
00:35:22,999 --> 00:35:26,999
for companies to by pass the privacy laws and to share

574
00:35:26,999 --> 00:35:29,751
a lot more information.

575
00:35:31,167 --> 00:35:33,999
So we started off the year with that.

576
00:35:33,999 --> 00:35:36,542
Congress year after year has consistently pushed

577
00:35:36,542 --> 00:35:40,584
cyber security, really online security, network security bills,

578
00:35:40,584 --> 00:35:44,542
all cyber talk has taken over Washington, D.C.

579
00:35:44,876 --> 00:35:49,083
They often at least the language they offer is not very technical.

580
00:35:49,083 --> 00:35:50,876
The terms are always pretty bad.

581
00:35:51,083 --> 00:35:55,667
So we started off this year with the House debating this issue

582
00:35:55,667 --> 00:36:00,667
and kind of arguing for these massive exemptions.

583
00:36:00,876 --> 00:36:03,250
And we over the course of a few months we had

584
00:36:03,250 --> 00:36:07,083
a very large campaign to combat this bill.

585
00:36:07,083 --> 00:36:08,501
It was one of many bills that comes back

586
00:36:08,501 --> 00:36:09,999
every year.

587
00:36:10,083 --> 00:36:12,999
And so this was in the House.

588
00:36:12,999 --> 00:36:19,209
We created a CISPA is bad bill; a zombie bill that comes back.

589
00:36:19,209 --> 00:36:21,667
Last year we defeated it.

590
00:36:21,667 --> 00:36:22,999
This year in the House it had passed

591
00:36:22,999 --> 00:36:25,459
but we ran a pretty successful campaign

592
00:36:25,459 --> 00:36:29,918
with numbers we hadn't seen since the SOBA campaign.

593
00:36:29,918 --> 00:36:33,959
We had over 100,000 signatures against this bill.

594
00:36:33,999 --> 00:36:35,167
Very show out of Congress men coming

595
00:36:35,167 --> 00:36:37,334
out against this bill.

596
00:36:37,584 --> 00:36:39,999
It was such a good showing that we were able

597
00:36:39,999 --> 00:36:43,083
to do such a good job with the help of the community that

598
00:36:43,083 --> 00:36:46,999
the Senate saw the bill, looked at a lot of our critiques and agreed

599
00:36:46,999 --> 00:36:50,876
with the massive privacy invasion that the bill had.

600
00:36:51,083 --> 00:36:53,667
They agreed it wasn't the right way to deal with online security

601
00:36:53,667 --> 00:36:56,375
or network security when it comes in the federal government

602
00:36:56,375 --> 00:36:58,459
and private companies.

603
00:36:58,792 --> 00:37:01,501
So the year kind of started out with that.

604
00:37:01,667 --> 00:37:05,542
Fortunately, they have kind of stopped pushing that,

605
00:37:05,542 --> 00:37:08,083
these types of bills.

606
00:37:08,250 --> 00:37:10,542
So far we'll see with the recent leaks.

607
00:37:10,959 --> 00:37:14,834
And it session segued, we moved on and segued

608
00:37:14,834 --> 00:37:18,751
into Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.

609
00:37:19,375 --> 00:37:22,999
And for the past, from probably January

610
00:37:22,999 --> 00:37:26,999
until June EFF along withstand forward and CDT

611
00:37:26,999 --> 00:37:32,751
and demand progress has been pushing for CFAA reform especially

612
00:37:32,751 --> 00:37:35,250
in light of Aaron.

613
00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:37,999
It was a really big issue and really important to us

614
00:37:37,999 --> 00:37:40,083
and the community.

615
00:37:40,334 --> 00:37:43,999
So we have this coalition of broad left to right coalition

616
00:37:43,999 --> 00:37:47,999
and we spent many months putting the pressure on Congress,

617
00:37:47,999 --> 00:37:52,375
creating a campaign from a wide and diverse set of individuals

618
00:37:52,375 --> 00:37:56,209
to change the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, to decrease

619
00:37:56,209 --> 00:38:00,584
the penalties in it, to clarify the law so it can't be abused

620
00:38:00,584 --> 00:38:04,626
and it's harder to be abused by the Department of Justice

621
00:38:04,626 --> 00:38:06,834
and by companies.

622
00:38:07,083 --> 00:38:11,417
To make sure that it's actually used for its original intents.

623
00:38:11,417 --> 00:38:12,999
Right now CFAA on the civil side tends

624
00:38:12,999 --> 00:38:17,792
to be used against trade secrets instead of hacking and that shouldn't

625
00:38:17,792 --> 00:38:19,542
be the case.

626
00:38:20,501 --> 00:38:25,209
After many months, about a few weeks ago, four weeks ago,

627
00:38:25,209 --> 00:38:29,999
three or four weeks ago, Senators Lofgren, Sensenbrenner,

628
00:38:29,999 --> 00:38:34,667
Wyden introduced Aaron's Law, a law that decreases some

629
00:38:34,667 --> 00:38:40,375
of the penalties, doesn't allow the government top bootstrap multiple

630
00:38:40,375 --> 00:38:44,626
penalties to jump up the prison time and clarifies

631
00:38:44,626 --> 00:38:48,834
and incorporates the two better judicial decisions

632
00:38:48,834 --> 00:38:53,375
out there in the Ninth and Fourth Circuits.

633
00:38:54,417 --> 00:38:57,999
This is one of the major campaigns going

634
00:38:57,999 --> 00:39:02,999
on and we actually have a phone booth that we brought that

635
00:39:02,999 --> 00:39:06,834
is in the contest area that is a direct line

636
00:39:06,834 --> 00:39:11,999
to Congress so you can call up the Congressional switchboard,

637
00:39:11,999 --> 00:39:18,999
ask for your rep and give them your mind and speak to them about it.

638
00:39:18,999 --> 00:39:21,334
(Applause.)    MARC JAYCOX: If anything, with the bills every year

639
00:39:21,334 --> 00:39:25,250
and how DC has been for a while but it's starting to get right in our faces,

640
00:39:25,250 --> 00:39:28,417
that it's time for the community to really push back and time

641
00:39:28,417 --> 00:39:32,667
for the community to engage with them and tell them what's up.

642
00:39:32,709 --> 00:39:35,584
And so that is one of our bigger campaigns.

643
00:39:35,584 --> 00:39:39,292
We have a pretty cool '80s phone booth that we have.

644
00:39:39,292 --> 00:39:42,999
And so I encourage you to go to the area and check it out.

645
00:39:43,083 --> 00:39:46,584
We have another thing that is part of CFAA reform

646
00:39:46,584 --> 00:39:51,083
is the security researchers letter and letter to Congress

647
00:39:51,083 --> 00:39:55,083
from the community, from DEF CON also.

648
00:39:55,626 --> 00:40:00,250
The letter demands Congress to take up CFAA reform which increasingly

649
00:40:00,250 --> 00:40:06,584
looks like a possibility and that they are going to do it and move it.

650
00:40:06,999 --> 00:40:08,459
And it's a letter from the community and

651
00:40:08,459 --> 00:40:11,501
from security researchers pretty much pushing for Aaron's Law

652
00:40:11,501 --> 00:40:13,999
and pushing for CFAA reform.

653
00:40:15,042 --> 00:40:18,999
That's kind of what has been going on with CFAA reform and you know,

654
00:40:18,999 --> 00:40:23,042
it does look like they are listening and the campaigns have been pretty

655
00:40:23,042 --> 00:40:27,125
fantastic so far and the response from the community has been fantastic

656
00:40:27,125 --> 00:40:28,626
so far.

657
00:40:28,999 --> 00:40:30,999
It looks like they will pick it up.

658
00:40:30,999 --> 00:40:32,751
They are going to discuss it.

659
00:40:32,751 --> 00:40:35,209
There will be hearings and we'll see where it goes.

660
00:40:35,209 --> 00:40:37,250
It's something that EFF will push on for and demand progress

661
00:40:37,250 --> 00:40:39,999
and pushing for it in Congress.

662
00:40:40,709 --> 00:40:48,209
Coming off of that, what happened next, that was probably until June, mid June.

663
00:40:48,834 --> 00:40:52,000
What happened next was the NSA spying leaks.

664
00:40:52,209 --> 00:40:56,542
And focused around that we just have had -- there

665
00:40:56,542 --> 00:41:00,167
are over ten bills to fix this.

666
00:41:00,584 --> 00:41:04,250
We had overnight campaigns launched, especially with the most recent,

667
00:41:04,250 --> 00:41:07,501
the first time since the leaks that Congress has had

668
00:41:07,501 --> 00:41:10,125
to speak out on this is the Amash Amendment,

669
00:41:10,125 --> 00:41:13,999
which I don't know how many people know about it, but it was

670
00:41:13,999 --> 00:41:17,959
a amendment that would defund and curtail one part of the spying,

671
00:41:17,959 --> 00:41:21,959
the use of the Patriot Act and culling that information that Kurt

672
00:41:21,959 --> 00:41:23,999
was talking about.

673
00:41:24,999 --> 00:41:29,375
And so since the leaks, pretty much what I have been doing

674
00:41:29,375 --> 00:41:32,792
is focusing on the legislation.

675
00:41:32,792 --> 00:41:37,501
The legislation deals with a variety of things from fixing section 215 so that

676
00:41:37,501 --> 00:41:39,999
this kind of bulk spying can't happen

677
00:41:39,999 --> 00:41:44,083
and doesn't happen; to fixing the -- the spying is over seen

678
00:41:44,083 --> 00:41:48,999
by the secret surveillance court called the FISA court.

679
00:41:50,959 --> 00:41:52,709
That's my preferred term.

680
00:41:52,999 --> 00:41:58,083
Some of the bills, you know, half of these ten bills deal with exposing

681
00:41:58,083 --> 00:42:02,999
the legal opinions and legal rationales that the government proposes

682
00:42:02,999 --> 00:42:07,292
to the secret corporate and remain top-secret.

683
00:42:07,292 --> 00:42:10,626
We don't -- this is secret law that none of us get to see.

684
00:42:10,626 --> 00:42:12,626
It's interpretations of the Fourth Amendment,

685
00:42:12,626 --> 00:42:16,751
interpretations of the statute that we haven't seen.

686
00:42:16,751 --> 00:42:18,542
So these bills push for the transparency

687
00:42:18,542 --> 00:42:22,250
around those opinions and pure structural reform of the court,

688
00:42:22,250 --> 00:42:25,999
making sure the court right now is composed of people selected

689
00:42:25,999 --> 00:42:29,626
by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.

690
00:42:29,999 --> 00:42:33,959
He nominates them and confirms them.

691
00:42:33,999 --> 00:42:36,918
We have a couple of bills that push for, we are not pushing for,

692
00:42:36,918 --> 00:42:40,417
but the Senators have a couple of structural reform bills that were

693
00:42:40,417 --> 00:42:43,459
released this week and we will be blogging about shortly,

694
00:42:43,459 --> 00:42:45,751
once I get out of here.

695
00:42:46,999 --> 00:42:49,209
That's part of the NSA spying.

696
00:42:49,459 --> 00:42:52,417
Then there's the Amash Amendment that was going

697
00:42:52,417 --> 00:42:55,999
to curtail part of section 215's program.

698
00:42:56,334 --> 00:42:58,209
It's a blunt instrument.

699
00:42:58,209 --> 00:43:00,792
An amendment to the defense budget bill.

700
00:43:00,792 --> 00:43:05,083
The House has the right, they have the power of the purse.

701
00:43:05,209 --> 00:43:07,999
And so we found out -- this was an amendment that, you know,

702
00:43:07,999 --> 00:43:10,626
we had known about for a week or so.

703
00:43:10,999 --> 00:43:12,417
It was unclear.

704
00:43:12,417 --> 00:43:14,459
The House, the way the House works, the leadership decides which

705
00:43:14,459 --> 00:43:16,999
amendment gets thrown to the floor.

706
00:43:16,999 --> 00:43:19,584
We didn't know this was going to come to the floor.

707
00:43:19,999 --> 00:43:21,999
We found out about 7:00 o'clock the night

708
00:43:21,999 --> 00:43:25,209
before and overnight we had a pretty ...

709
00:43:30,125 --> 00:43:34,918
(Lost audio.)    MARC JAYCOX: Impressed a whole bunch of people.

710
00:43:36,334 --> 00:43:40,918
Overnight we pretty much created an activism campaign.

711
00:43:40,918 --> 00:43:41,999
Form a lot of support.

712
00:43:42,626 --> 00:43:45,501
The community reacted brilliantly.

713
00:43:45,918 --> 00:43:52,792
We got the best vote that we've gotten since the reauthorization of these laws.

714
00:43:52,792 --> 00:43:54,501
And it's a tremendous, a clear signal

715
00:43:54,501 --> 00:43:58,417
from Congress that we are, in my opinion it's a clear signal

716
00:43:58,417 --> 00:44:00,999
from Congress that they are very dubious

717
00:44:00,999 --> 00:44:05,999
of how section 215 is being used and they want to change it.

718
00:44:05,999 --> 00:44:10,999
That's kind of been my first, or the first six months of this year.

719
00:44:10,999 --> 00:44:13,083
It has been really fun, intense.

720
00:44:13,083 --> 00:44:15,334
That's kind of what I have been focusing on.

721
00:44:22,542 --> 00:44:25,125
(Applause.)    KURT OPSAHL: All right.

722
00:44:25,125 --> 00:44:26,417
Now it's time to get your questions asked

723
00:44:26,417 --> 00:44:28,083
and answered.

724
00:44:28,584 --> 00:44:32,167
So anybody who has questions about anything we just discussed

725
00:44:32,167 --> 00:44:35,292
or other aspects of EFF's work?

726
00:44:35,292 --> 00:44:38,584
Please come to the microphone here and we

727
00:44:38,584 --> 00:44:43,375
will do our best to answer your questions.

728
00:44:43,375 --> 00:44:48,792
AUDIENCE: The FISA court seems to my mind to be a secret court,

729
00:44:48,792 --> 00:44:51,999
a tool of a police state.

730
00:44:52,584 --> 00:45:01,083
I mean, it seems like it probably has a thin justification.

731
00:45:01,083 --> 00:45:07,083
What is the justification and why can't that court be abolished in total?

732
00:45:07,083 --> 00:45:10,083
KURT OPSAHL: The question is what is the justification

733
00:45:10,083 --> 00:45:14,584
for the foreign intelligence surveillance court?

734
00:45:15,999 --> 00:45:20,125
It was created by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance

735
00:45:20,125 --> 00:45:24,999
Act which, oddly enough, was an attempt at reform.

736
00:45:24,999 --> 00:45:28,959
Previously there were no courts that were being involved and so

737
00:45:28,959 --> 00:45:32,292
they created the foreign intelligence surveillance

738
00:45:32,292 --> 00:45:36,209
court in order to have judges be involved.

739
00:45:36,209 --> 00:45:38,959
So in that sense it was an attempt to bring some aspects

740
00:45:38,959 --> 00:45:41,167
of the judiciary into it.

741
00:45:41,167 --> 00:45:43,125
What has happened is, as a secret court, it

742
00:45:43,125 --> 00:45:46,918
is doing secret reinterpretations of the law.

743
00:45:46,959 --> 00:45:50,876
These have gone into some very strange directions.

744
00:45:50,876 --> 00:45:53,167
I'll just give one sort of example of where this has gone

745
00:45:53,167 --> 00:45:55,999
in some very weird directions.

746
00:45:55,999 --> 00:45:59,584
So the law that allows the government or, you know,

747
00:45:59,584 --> 00:46:03,999
the government says it allows to get your phone records

748
00:46:03,999 --> 00:46:07,918
is section 215 of the Patriot Act.

749
00:46:07,918 --> 00:46:11,918
And Section 215 says amongst other things that it can get business records

750
00:46:11,918 --> 00:46:15,999
that are relevant to an authorized investigation.

751
00:46:16,459 --> 00:46:20,999
And under that secret interpretation of the law, all of the records

752
00:46:20,999 --> 00:46:24,375
of all of the people for all of the time are relevant

753
00:46:24,375 --> 00:46:27,459
to an authorized investigation.

754
00:46:27,459 --> 00:46:29,584
(Chuckles.)    MARC JAYCOX: We haven't seen what that interpretation is,

755
00:46:29,584 --> 00:46:31,959
but I'm really curious to see it.

756
00:46:32,167 --> 00:46:35,959
It's going to be an amazing piece of BS, right?

757
00:46:35,959 --> 00:46:37,918
How can you make it so that everything is -- I mean,

758
00:46:37,918 --> 00:46:41,501
relevant becomes essentially a meaningless word.

759
00:46:41,792 --> 00:46:43,334
There's no difference in that statute

760
00:46:43,334 --> 00:46:46,834
with the world relevant and without the word relevant.

761
00:46:51,375 --> 00:46:55,667
And Sensenbrenner, actually the author of that part

762
00:46:55,667 --> 00:47:01,959
of the Patriot Act agrees that is not what it was meant to say.

763
00:47:01,959 --> 00:47:04,250
That's the problem with the secret FISA court.

764
00:47:04,250 --> 00:47:09,542
AUDIENCE: Wouldn't that require 310 minimum search warrants,

765
00:47:09,542 --> 00:47:13,999
the cats case, that can't be legal.

766
00:47:15,999 --> 00:47:18,999
The Fourth Amendment says you need a search warrant.

767
00:47:20,083 --> 00:47:22,209
310 million.

768
00:47:22,209 --> 00:47:24,083
AUDIENCE: (Speaker away from microphone.)    It is true,

769
00:47:24,083 --> 00:47:27,209
illegal and unconstitutional are not the same thing, but we think

770
00:47:27,209 --> 00:47:30,751
the amendment is both illegal and unconstitutional.

771
00:47:30,751 --> 00:47:39,667
(Applause.)    AUDIENCE: You talked about EFF's add-on

772
00:47:39,667 --> 00:47:45,959
for blocking tracking cookies.

773
00:47:46,999 --> 00:47:49,626
How does your approach compare to Firefox's approach

774
00:47:49,626 --> 00:47:52,459
of blocking third-party cookies by default and then having

775
00:47:52,459 --> 00:47:55,542
the cookie clearinghouse to create white lists and black lists

776
00:47:55,542 --> 00:47:57,918
based on privacy policies?

777
00:47:57,999 --> 00:47:59,417
Sure.

778
00:47:59,417 --> 00:48:06,375
So ours is not a third-party cookie blocking in general.

779
00:48:06,375 --> 00:48:08,918
How it works is, it's more like an ad blocker.

780
00:48:08,918 --> 00:48:13,125
First of all it's not just blocking cookies, it black holes resources similar

781
00:48:13,125 --> 00:48:16,918
to the way many ad blockers work today.

782
00:48:17,083 --> 00:48:21,959
So if you look apartment kind of the spectrum there's blocking based

783
00:48:21,959 --> 00:48:26,999
on very general metrics, like block all third-party cookies.

784
00:48:26,999 --> 00:48:29,083
Then there's, here is a list of particular resources you

785
00:48:29,083 --> 00:48:30,792
should block.

786
00:48:30,792 --> 00:48:32,999
We are trying to find somewhere in the middle.

787
00:48:33,542 --> 00:48:35,292
We think both of those approaches are valuable

788
00:48:35,292 --> 00:48:38,459
and users should install an ad blocker and disable third-party

789
00:48:38,459 --> 00:48:40,792
cookies in their browser.

790
00:48:41,083 --> 00:48:44,375
But in addition we wanted to add to that by having

791
00:48:44,375 --> 00:48:48,667
in middle area where it is sort of functioning like an ad blocker

792
00:48:48,667 --> 00:48:52,834
except as you browse around it is dynamically updating the list

793
00:48:52,834 --> 00:48:56,334
of resources that should be black holed.

794
00:48:56,334 --> 00:48:58,250
So I hope that answers the question.

795
00:48:58,250 --> 00:49:00,125
AUDIENCE: Yes, thank you.

796
00:49:00,501 --> 00:49:03,501
AUDIENCE: Hi.

797
00:49:03,876 --> 00:49:06,292
I also wanted to ask about the markets firms,

798
00:49:06,292 --> 00:49:12,334
like private sector marketing firms and nonconsensual tracking piece of it.

799
00:49:12,542 --> 00:49:14,999
You hear stories about people browsing

800
00:49:14,999 --> 00:49:19,542
for baby stuff and getting catalog for maternity things two weeks later

801
00:49:19,542 --> 00:49:24,125
or marketing that looks where your mouse goes, and so on.

802
00:49:24,334 --> 00:49:26,876
My question is: How bad are the capabilities

803
00:49:26,876 --> 00:49:31,959
of these private sector markets firms in the first place and secondarily are

804
00:49:31,959 --> 00:49:36,083
they subscribed to by governments in order to turn that metadata

805
00:49:36,083 --> 00:49:39,209
into uniquely identifiable data?

806
00:49:39,459 --> 00:49:41,751
Those are great questions and the short answer is,

807
00:49:41,751 --> 00:49:43,834
we don't really know.

808
00:49:43,999 --> 00:49:47,959
We don't know too much about whether the government has

809
00:49:47,959 --> 00:49:50,250
gone to these firms to request data

810
00:49:50,250 --> 00:49:53,709
because those requests are secret.

811
00:49:53,999 --> 00:49:57,250
Some companies are starting to publish transparency reports.

812
00:49:57,334 --> 00:50:00,999
These are generally the larger tech companies that have

813
00:50:00,999 --> 00:50:04,918
first party presence like Google and Facebook and Microsoft

814
00:50:04,918 --> 00:50:06,626
and Twitter.

815
00:50:06,709 --> 00:50:12,999
But not the invisible third-party ad companies that you've never heard of.

816
00:50:12,999 --> 00:50:16,417
So we don't really know what data is being requested of them.

817
00:50:16,417 --> 00:50:21,542
As far as what abilities they have, also it's hard to know.

818
00:50:21,542 --> 00:50:22,334
I think there's a lot of data that gets passed

819
00:50:22,334 --> 00:50:24,250
around in the background.

820
00:50:24,250 --> 00:50:26,334
Right now it's the wild west.

821
00:50:26,334 --> 00:50:28,834
There's just no rules about what you can do or can't do

822
00:50:28,834 --> 00:50:30,709
with user data.

823
00:50:31,292 --> 00:50:34,250
So it is probably safe to assume that

824
00:50:34,250 --> 00:50:37,999
a browsing history associated with a pseudonym

825
00:50:37,999 --> 00:50:41,918
is in the hands much many companies.

826
00:50:41,999 --> 00:50:45,999
If you -- corresponding to you if you're browsing around the Web.

827
00:50:45,999 --> 00:50:48,167
That's kind of a half answer.

828
00:50:48,167 --> 00:50:51,125
That's the closest we get to really knowing.

829
00:50:51,125 --> 00:50:53,375
I want to add on to that, one of the aspects of this

830
00:50:53,375 --> 00:50:56,709
is data broker companies, commercial companies that collect

831
00:50:56,709 --> 00:50:59,792
information from a variety of sources and repackage that

832
00:50:59,792 --> 00:51:02,999
and make it available for commercial sale.

833
00:51:03,501 --> 00:51:06,083
I think that you should basically rest assured that

834
00:51:06,083 --> 00:51:10,999
the government has purchased subscriptions to these services.

835
00:51:10,999 --> 00:51:14,292
I can say that there has been some FOIA work done

836
00:51:14,292 --> 00:51:20,375
by the EPIC that confirms that, confirmed that several years ago.

837
00:51:20,375 --> 00:51:21,834
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

838
00:51:22,792 --> 00:51:24,876
AUDIENCE: Kind of a two part question

839
00:51:24,876 --> 00:51:28,375
about Computer Assistance for Law Enforcement Act?

840
00:51:30,584 --> 00:51:34,999
Yeah, I wrote an article earlier this year, foolishly, which

841
00:51:34,999 --> 00:51:38,083
the title inferred that the FBI was planning

842
00:51:38,083 --> 00:51:42,792
on surveilling our realtime online communications.

843
00:51:42,999 --> 00:51:47,209
That was before the NSA revelations.

844
00:51:47,501 --> 00:51:53,083
So the two-part question is: One, is CALEA receiving enough, I guess,

845
00:51:53,083 --> 00:51:56,167
awareness from the public?

846
00:51:56,167 --> 00:51:57,334
Is that still a threat?

847
00:51:57,334 --> 00:52:01,375
And I know that the FBI made some statements

848
00:52:01,375 --> 00:52:03,999
several times.

849
00:52:03,999 --> 00:52:07,999
One of their previous legal counsels in a course earlier this year

850
00:52:07,999 --> 00:52:12,209
to expand CALEA to allow for online surveillance as well

851
00:52:12,209 --> 00:52:17,250
as extending the privileges to local law enforcement.

852
00:52:17,834 --> 00:52:21,626
And then the second part of the question is,

853
00:52:21,626 --> 00:52:25,083
concerning jurisdiction, if for instance

854
00:52:25,083 --> 00:52:31,334
a local law enforcement agency had permission to do surveillance online,

855
00:52:31,334 --> 00:52:35,999
how exactly do you think that would work?

856
00:52:35,999 --> 00:52:39,334
Obviously it's difficult for them to identify where the person

857
00:52:39,334 --> 00:52:43,334
is when they are doing online surveillance.

858
00:52:43,334 --> 00:52:46,792
I see that kind of as the equivalent of someone

859
00:52:46,792 --> 00:52:51,167
from Las Vegas police department coming to my home and

860
00:52:51,167 --> 00:52:55,999
in a different state and performing a search.

861
00:52:55,999 --> 00:52:59,999
So I'll just answer as to if CALEA is still a threat.

862
00:53:00,459 --> 00:53:05,459
And then Kurt and Marcia and Eva can tackle the other part.

863
00:53:05,459 --> 00:53:06,459
Perfect.

864
00:53:06,459 --> 00:53:09,999
So the answer is yes, definitely.

865
00:53:09,999 --> 00:53:13,792
But what we've seen is the government become very reticent

866
00:53:13,792 --> 00:53:17,125
and nervous about discussing CALEA or discussing

867
00:53:17,125 --> 00:53:20,999
even -- I'll jump back to the online security bills,

868
00:53:20,999 --> 00:53:23,834
the cyber security bills.

869
00:53:23,834 --> 00:53:26,542
They have been nervous because it's completely outlandish

870
00:53:26,542 --> 00:53:29,083
for them to push such bills when we sometime

871
00:53:29,083 --> 00:53:32,999
don't know what is going on with the surveillance.

872
00:53:32,999 --> 00:53:34,626
We sometime don't know what is going on with how they uses

873
00:53:34,626 --> 00:53:36,792
the FISA, Foreign Intelligence Secuirty Act Court

874
00:53:36,792 --> 00:53:38,667
and things like that.

875
00:53:38,999 --> 00:53:42,626
It is very much a threat and it's something that we

876
00:53:42,626 --> 00:53:47,083
as a community, we as EFF have to keep our toes on.

877
00:53:47,209 --> 00:53:50,375
The second we fall asleep or the second we miss something,

878
00:53:50,375 --> 00:53:54,999
they may try to slip it in or try to continue to push it.

879
00:53:54,999 --> 00:53:57,999
For now I don't think -- for now, at least for short-term, next month

880
00:53:57,999 --> 00:54:00,999
or two, I don't think it is a threat.

881
00:54:00,999 --> 00:54:02,667
Definitely medium to long-term it is something that

882
00:54:02,667 --> 00:54:06,542
they have been very vocal about and something to watch for.

883
00:54:06,542 --> 00:54:12,999
And I really hope that we don't have to go through another Crypto war.

884
00:54:12,999 --> 00:54:15,501
I want to add in terms of like extending those abilities

885
00:54:15,501 --> 00:54:19,334
down to local law enforcement, the first time that was discussed

886
00:54:19,334 --> 00:54:23,375
with their legal counsel in front of the subcommittee and Congress,

887
00:54:23,375 --> 00:54:27,083
the two examples they brought up were the importation of drugs

888
00:54:27,083 --> 00:54:32,083
and like child pornography which are not national security issues.

889
00:54:32,292 --> 00:54:38,375
MARCIA HOFFMANN: To be clear for everybody here, CALEA does not

890
00:54:38,375 --> 00:54:45,083
at this time include the ability to wiretap the Internet.

891
00:54:45,083 --> 00:54:47,542
And there has actually been a lot of questions

892
00:54:47,542 --> 00:54:50,709
about whether or not this includes Skype, which

893
00:54:50,709 --> 00:54:54,999
is a Voiceover IP service and it is used by hundreds of millions

894
00:54:54,999 --> 00:54:57,876
of people all over the world.

895
00:54:58,083 --> 00:55:02,250
Until fairly recently, until a couple of years ago Skype was

896
00:55:02,250 --> 00:55:05,209
a European-based company.

897
00:55:05,250 --> 00:55:09,083
Therefore, it was not even potentially coming under CALEA

898
00:55:09,083 --> 00:55:13,417
because it was out of CALEA's jurisdiction.

899
00:55:13,417 --> 00:55:15,999
But when Skype was purchased by Microsoft,

900
00:55:15,999 --> 00:55:20,667
suddenly there were questions about whether or not Skype would be

901
00:55:20,667 --> 00:55:25,083
required to include sort of back door wiretapping capabilities

902
00:55:25,083 --> 00:55:29,834
in order to comply with law enforcement requests.

903
00:55:30,083 --> 00:55:34,792
In order to clarify this, EFF was part of a coalition of individuals

904
00:55:34,792 --> 00:55:38,709
and NGOs that wrote a letter to Microsoft requesting

905
00:55:38,709 --> 00:55:41,999
a transparency report on Skype, saying: Hey,

906
00:55:41,999 --> 00:55:46,125
if you could just clarify whether or not you are tapping

907
00:55:46,125 --> 00:55:49,959
hundreds of millions of users' Voiceover IP phone

908
00:55:49,959 --> 00:55:54,501
communications, we would really appreciate that.

909
00:55:54,751 --> 00:55:57,792
So in a very gratifying moment Microsoft

910
00:55:57,792 --> 00:56:00,250
did us one better.

911
00:56:00,250 --> 00:56:02,626
A few months later they came out with a transparency report

912
00:56:02,626 --> 00:56:05,999
for all of their products, including Skype.

913
00:56:05,999 --> 00:56:08,918
If you take a look at Microsoft's transparency report

914
00:56:08,918 --> 00:56:13,999
for Skype it says we have never given up any phone calls, any content data,

915
00:56:13,999 --> 00:56:17,792
anything to the governments in response to a request,

916
00:56:17,792 --> 00:56:19,999
to any government.

917
00:56:21,209 --> 00:56:26,083
Then the Snowden revelations came around and we started looking

918
00:56:26,083 --> 00:56:31,999
at the Prism slides which included Skype as a source of content.

919
00:56:31,999 --> 00:56:34,999
And a lot of the other Snowden revelations have

920
00:56:34,999 --> 00:56:39,459
seriously implied or out right stated at one point or another

921
00:56:39,459 --> 00:56:44,584
the NSA has had the ability to tap Skype communications.

922
00:56:44,584 --> 00:56:46,375
So I think that Microsoft and Skype have a great deal

923
00:56:46,375 --> 00:56:48,292
of explaining to do.

924
00:56:48,292 --> 00:56:50,751
It's unclear the extent to which the NSA is capability

925
00:56:50,751 --> 00:56:54,083
of eavesdropping on Skype communications.

926
00:56:54,626 --> 00:56:57,083
One of the things that does appear to be clear,

927
00:56:57,083 --> 00:57:01,999
they are probably not doing it under the auspices of CALEA.

928
00:57:02,375 --> 00:57:05,626
They have a different legal justification for doing this.

929
00:57:05,834 --> 00:57:09,751
But it could very well be happening and we are very interest interested

930
00:57:09,751 --> 00:57:14,292
in learning just what the extent of that eavesdropping is.

931
00:57:14,292 --> 00:57:17,459
And whether or not Microsoft or Skype were really capable

932
00:57:17,459 --> 00:57:20,918
of telling us that it was going on.

933
00:57:21,209 --> 00:57:26,250
I want to briefly address the jurisdictional questions.

934
00:57:26,250 --> 00:57:28,834
CALEA is mostly about requiring service providers

935
00:57:28,834 --> 00:57:33,501
to have tap-ability, like the ability for law enforcement to be able

936
00:57:33,501 --> 00:57:37,751
to get telecommunications that went over them.

937
00:57:37,751 --> 00:57:40,792
But where are they getting the authority to do

938
00:57:40,792 --> 00:57:44,709
the wiretap comes from other sources.

939
00:57:44,709 --> 00:57:48,334
You have like the wiretap, some kind of information would be attained

940
00:57:48,334 --> 00:57:53,250
through a warrant that is obtained through the Wiretap Act.

941
00:57:53,709 --> 00:57:56,375
If they are going through foreign intelligence

942
00:57:56,375 --> 00:58:00,083
surveillance court there are processes there.

943
00:58:00,083 --> 00:58:02,999
I guess the jurisdictional question was sort

944
00:58:02,999 --> 00:58:06,999
of about their desire to sort of extend these realtime surveillance

945
00:58:06,999 --> 00:58:10,125
powers down to local law enforcement.

946
00:58:10,125 --> 00:58:11,292
Well, local law enforcement has

947
00:58:11,292 --> 00:58:13,167
wiretap powers.

948
00:58:13,292 --> 00:58:16,792
If they go to court and get an appropriate court order,

949
00:58:16,792 --> 00:58:20,292
local law enforcement can do tapping.

950
00:58:20,292 --> 00:58:21,292
AUDIENCE: Okay.

951
00:58:21,292 --> 00:58:23,751
MARCIA HOFFMANN: Just not on the Internet.

952
00:58:23,751 --> 00:58:25,334
Is not under CALEA.

953
00:58:25,334 --> 00:58:26,334
Also.

954
00:58:26,334 --> 00:58:28,626
And thank you for Weev and bringing that up.

955
00:58:28,626 --> 00:58:33,167
AUDIENCE: So my question is, we all get to go home at the end

956
00:58:33,167 --> 00:58:37,125
of this and go back to our families.

957
00:58:37,334 --> 00:58:40,083
But the guy who started this whole conversation is locked

958
00:58:40,083 --> 00:58:42,501
in an airport terminal.

959
00:58:42,501 --> 00:58:43,834
He's out now.

960
00:58:43,834 --> 00:58:44,667
AUDIENCE: Okay, I haven't seen a newspaper

961
00:58:44,667 --> 00:58:46,751
in Vegas since I got here.

962
00:58:48,083 --> 00:58:49,999
How can we help him?

963
00:58:49,999 --> 00:58:55,417
He is stuck in Russia where the food is notoriously bad.

964
00:58:57,083 --> 00:58:58,667
Borscht?

965
00:58:58,667 --> 00:59:02,959
In terms of the news, the Russians granted him

966
00:59:02,959 --> 00:59:05,626
one-year asylum.

967
00:59:05,918 --> 00:59:08,999
He is no longer in the airport.

968
00:59:11,999 --> 00:59:14,999
(Applause.)    We just applauded the Russians.

969
00:59:16,876 --> 00:59:18,459
Don't be fooled.

970
00:59:18,459 --> 00:59:21,250
The Putin government is not a wonderful government.

971
00:59:21,250 --> 00:59:24,083
They are authoritarian and done terrible things.

972
00:59:24,083 --> 00:59:25,999
Especially with the Internet.

973
00:59:26,083 --> 00:59:28,209
This is part of a global power play

974
00:59:28,209 --> 00:59:31,292
between the United States and Russia.

975
00:59:31,792 --> 00:59:35,501
It just sort of happened, how it happened to play out here.

976
00:59:35,501 --> 00:59:37,959
One of the things that is very important about this,

977
00:59:37,959 --> 00:59:42,167
what we are trying to do especially with some of the work that we are doing

978
00:59:42,167 --> 00:59:45,709
with filing a new lawsuit, pushing forward with that, going

979
00:59:45,709 --> 00:59:48,250
to Congress, trying to get better legislation

980
00:59:48,250 --> 00:59:52,250
is take advantage of what Snowden has put out there.

981
00:59:52,792 --> 00:59:54,792
He put this information out there.

982
00:59:55,125 --> 00:59:58,250
Not for himself but for all of you so people could find

983
00:59:58,250 --> 01:00:02,459
out what was going on and what we can do with it.

984
01:00:02,459 --> 01:00:04,167
So we have all this information.

985
01:00:04,167 --> 01:00:05,167
Study it.

986
01:00:05,167 --> 01:00:06,167
Figure it out.

987
01:00:06,167 --> 01:00:07,542
Figure out what is going on and see what we can do

988
01:00:07,542 --> 01:00:10,999
to stop illegal and unconstitutional surveillance.

989
01:00:16,375 --> 01:00:19,792
(Applause.)    AUDIENCE: So on the topic of Snowden and Weev

990
01:00:19,792 --> 01:00:22,083
and others, what are the federal definitions

991
01:00:22,083 --> 01:00:24,125
of whistle blowers.

992
01:00:24,125 --> 01:00:25,709
How does the government get around that in order

993
01:00:25,709 --> 01:00:28,999
to prosecute someone in a civil or criminal case.

994
01:00:28,999 --> 01:00:31,083
What protections do we have?

995
01:00:31,209 --> 01:00:35,876
(Some applause.)    So whistle blower law is primarily,

996
01:00:35,876 --> 01:00:41,334
the whistle blower laws are designed to protect people who go

997
01:00:41,334 --> 01:00:45,501
to the government to whistle blow.

998
01:00:45,626 --> 01:00:47,999
(Laughter.)   : So what the government's position on this

999
01:00:47,999 --> 01:00:49,999
is actually, yeah, you should have gone

1000
01:00:49,999 --> 01:00:52,999
to your supervisor at the NSA and told them all about it and

1001
01:00:52,999 --> 01:00:56,292
they will take it up the appropriate channels.

1002
01:00:56,918 --> 01:00:58,751
(Chuckles.)    And some people have tried

1003
01:00:58,751 --> 01:01:02,083
to do this and have not gotten responses.

1004
01:01:02,083 --> 01:01:04,167
There actually may be a lot of people who are part

1005
01:01:04,167 --> 01:01:08,083
of the system who have gone through the existing whistle blowers,

1006
01:01:08,083 --> 01:01:12,999
talked to the inspectors general, talked to appropriate people.

1007
01:01:12,999 --> 01:01:14,083
Of course, we never found out about it

1008
01:01:14,083 --> 01:01:17,709
because the people upstream just ended the inquiry.

1009
01:01:18,083 --> 01:01:21,999
So unfortunately, the protections for whistle blowers who are whistle

1010
01:01:21,999 --> 01:01:25,751
blowing to the press and to the public are not very robust

1011
01:01:25,751 --> 01:01:28,999
in the laws because a lot of the times the government

1012
01:01:28,999 --> 01:01:32,999
is not that keen on things coming out that way.

1013
01:01:33,083 --> 01:01:35,667
There are a number of good organizations that focus

1014
01:01:35,667 --> 01:01:38,083
on whistle blowers, whistleblowers.org and

1015
01:01:38,083 --> 01:01:42,250
the government accountability project focus on people who are interested

1016
01:01:42,250 --> 01:01:44,667
in blowing the whistle.

1017
01:01:44,999 --> 01:01:47,709
If you know someone who has information and wants to blow

1018
01:01:47,709 --> 01:01:49,999
the whistle on it, those are really good resources

1019
01:01:49,999 --> 01:01:51,501
for them.

1020
01:01:51,501 --> 01:01:55,667
AUDIENCE: Then on the topic of CFAA and Booz Allen and other very

1021
01:01:55,667 --> 01:01:59,667
interesting curious government contractors.

1022
01:01:59,667 --> 01:02:02,542
So when you would end up like breaking into something that

1023
01:02:02,542 --> 01:02:06,584
is owned publicly and that's clearly in violation of intended access,

1024
01:02:06,584 --> 01:02:09,667
does that mean that the people that would be working

1025
01:02:09,667 --> 01:02:12,999
for the government to build stuff like that are actually

1026
01:02:12,999 --> 01:02:15,083
committing felonies?

1027
01:02:15,375 --> 01:02:18,999
Are they at risk to get prosecuted by that if, for example, they blow

1028
01:02:18,999 --> 01:02:21,459
the whistle on something?

1029
01:02:21,459 --> 01:02:25,999
If you install a root killing device and intended to go to China

1030
01:02:25,999 --> 01:02:31,918
but are jail breaking a device to add different firm ware --    Let me

1031
01:02:31,918 --> 01:02:34,751
see if I can try this.

1032
01:02:34,751 --> 01:02:37,584
I'm not sure about your question but see if I can rephrase it or see

1033
01:02:37,584 --> 01:02:39,918
if I can understand it.

1034
01:02:39,918 --> 01:02:42,667
Talking about somebody working for the government and in the course

1035
01:02:42,667 --> 01:02:45,959
of their work for the government they get access to a device

1036
01:02:45,959 --> 01:02:48,375
or exceed authorized access?

1037
01:02:48,375 --> 01:02:49,375
AUDIENCE: Yes.

1038
01:02:49,876 --> 01:02:52,999
: So if they are doing so lawfully, that is to say pursuant

1039
01:02:52,999 --> 01:02:57,584
to a warrant that authorizes the access, that's one story.

1040
01:02:57,584 --> 01:03:00,626
And if they are doing it unlawfully which is to say because it

1041
01:03:00,626 --> 01:03:04,792
is exceeding what they are allowed to do under the constitution, it

1042
01:03:04,792 --> 01:03:06,999
is a different story.

1043
01:03:07,334 --> 01:03:08,999
It would be illegal.

1044
01:03:08,999 --> 01:03:12,999
In some circumstances you can prosecute government officials who

1045
01:03:12,999 --> 01:03:15,626
exceed their authority.

1046
01:03:15,626 --> 01:03:19,667
But the law is actually fairly friendly to law enforcement officials who

1047
01:03:19,667 --> 01:03:22,709
over step bounds and it is sort of, it comes

1048
01:03:22,709 --> 01:03:26,417
down to whether you are exceeding a clearly established

1049
01:03:26,417 --> 01:03:28,959
constitutional right.

1050
01:03:28,959 --> 01:03:29,999
If it's the first time the courts are dealing

1051
01:03:29,999 --> 01:03:32,751
with a question there's a bit of a pass.

1052
01:03:32,751 --> 01:03:36,999
There's a question of whether it was intentional misuse.

1053
01:03:37,999 --> 01:03:41,417
It is fairly rare for a government official who exceeds

1054
01:03:41,417 --> 01:03:45,751
their authority in air manner that the government wanted them to do

1055
01:03:45,751 --> 01:03:47,959
to get prosecuted.

1056
01:03:47,959 --> 01:03:49,125
If someone exceeds their authority in a way that

1057
01:03:49,125 --> 01:03:53,167
the government didn't want them to do, they are at risk of being prosecuted.

1058
01:03:53,167 --> 01:03:54,999
AUDIENCE: I'm thinking of government contractors,

1059
01:03:54,999 --> 01:03:58,250
people who are not government officials but still deal with stuff that

1060
01:03:58,250 --> 01:04:00,417
the government purchases.

1061
01:04:00,999 --> 01:04:09,999
I think there are less protections.

1062
01:04:09,999 --> 01:04:13,999
But if they are doing it pursuant to lawfully authorized warrant,

1063
01:04:13,999 --> 01:04:17,709
then that should provide protection.

1064
01:04:17,709 --> 01:04:19,751
There's a lot of things in the law where it says good faith

1065
01:04:19,751 --> 01:04:22,125
compliance with a lawfully authorized warrant can

1066
01:04:22,125 --> 01:04:23,999
be protected.

1067
01:04:23,999 --> 01:04:26,584
If someone is not acting in good faith, if they are doing something

1068
01:04:26,584 --> 01:04:28,999
they know is illegal, it may be something that

1069
01:04:28,999 --> 01:04:30,999
they can go forward.

1070
01:04:31,083 --> 01:04:36,542
It's unlikely that Booz Allen find itself indicted or prosecuted for that.

1071
01:04:36,542 --> 01:04:39,167
I will say that the CFAA has an exception

1072
01:04:39,167 --> 01:04:44,959
for any lawfully authorized investigative protective or intelligence activity

1073
01:04:44,959 --> 01:04:48,626
of a law enforcement agency of the United States or

1074
01:04:48,626 --> 01:04:53,083
of any intelligence agency of the United States.

1075
01:04:53,167 --> 01:04:56,250
So particularly to the extent that a private contractor

1076
01:04:56,250 --> 01:05:00,459
is doing work on behalf of the government in that vein, I think,

1077
01:05:00,459 --> 01:05:03,876
you know, the statute pretty clearly wouldn't apply

1078
01:05:03,876 --> 01:05:05,250
to them.

1079
01:05:05,250 --> 01:05:06,250
AUDIENCE: Okay.

1080
01:05:06,375 --> 01:05:07,375
Thank you very much.

1081
01:05:08,999 --> 01:05:11,083
AUDIENCE: First I want to say thanks.

1082
01:05:11,083 --> 01:05:12,999
I appreciate everything the EFF is doing to protect our rights,

1083
01:05:12,999 --> 01:05:15,292
that we supposedly already have.

1084
01:05:20,999 --> 01:05:23,167
(Applause.)    AUDIENCE: I want to continue in the vein

1085
01:05:23,167 --> 01:05:24,999
of whistle blowers.

1086
01:05:25,083 --> 01:05:28,999
How can grassroots or legislative reform help to protect leakers

1087
01:05:28,999 --> 01:05:31,167
and whistle blowers.

1088
01:05:31,792 --> 01:05:35,375
If you study history you see that governments are always prone

1089
01:05:35,375 --> 01:05:37,459
to abuse and to becoming oppressive

1090
01:05:37,459 --> 01:05:39,542
at various points.

1091
01:05:39,709 --> 01:05:42,334
We need leakers and whistle blowers like Snowden.

1092
01:05:42,834 --> 01:05:46,999
How can we as an Internet savvy community solve

1093
01:05:46,999 --> 01:05:54,542
that bigger problem of protecting, like with the pentagon papers.

1094
01:05:54,542 --> 01:05:56,542
You know, restoring some of those protections to leakers

1095
01:05:56,542 --> 01:05:58,501
and whistle blowers.

1096
01:06:03,292 --> 01:06:05,209
On the legislative stuff?

1097
01:06:06,584 --> 01:06:09,999
In general there are a couple of things out there.

1098
01:06:09,999 --> 01:06:14,584
I mean, there's an attempt to get a federal reporter shield law.

1099
01:06:14,959 --> 01:06:19,250
Now, this gets at the problem in a little bit of a different direction,

1100
01:06:19,250 --> 01:06:22,918
which is to say it protects journalists from having

1101
01:06:22,918 --> 01:06:26,209
to disclose who their sources were.

1102
01:06:26,209 --> 01:06:30,083
So that if somebody goes in confidence to a journalist and says,

1103
01:06:30,083 --> 01:06:34,292
you know, here is the evidence of wrongdoing.

1104
01:06:34,626 --> 01:06:37,584
The government says okay, who gave that to you?

1105
01:06:37,584 --> 01:06:39,584
If they were a federal shield law they would say I'm protected

1106
01:06:39,584 --> 01:06:41,334
by the shield law.

1107
01:06:41,334 --> 01:06:44,334
I don't have to disclose who my source is.

1108
01:06:44,334 --> 01:06:47,375
A lot of states have shield laws.

1109
01:06:47,501 --> 01:06:49,999
Some of them are very protective.

1110
01:06:49,999 --> 01:06:51,999
Some of them are modestly protective.

1111
01:06:52,083 --> 01:06:54,999
There is no federal shield law.

1112
01:06:55,125 --> 01:06:57,250
Then also there's the First Amendment

1113
01:06:57,250 --> 01:07:01,999
and its protections for freedom of speech and freedom of the press

1114
01:07:01,999 --> 01:07:05,334
and how that has shaken out in the courts is that

1115
01:07:05,334 --> 01:07:10,250
on the whole there are protections for having reporters having to give

1116
01:07:10,250 --> 01:07:13,083
up their sources but they can be overcome

1117
01:07:13,083 --> 01:07:17,751
by a sufficient showing of need by the government.

1118
01:07:17,751 --> 01:07:18,417
The government has tried to get this information

1119
01:07:18,417 --> 01:07:20,501
from other sources and failed.

1120
01:07:20,876 --> 01:07:25,999
And so the only thing to do would be to use impact litigation in a court

1121
01:07:25,999 --> 01:07:30,417
and try to show a court that the First Amendment does apply and

1122
01:07:30,417 --> 01:07:35,542
to give greater protections because, you know, there's a quote from one

1123
01:07:35,542 --> 01:07:40,250
of the founders of this country, and I'm going to badly paraphrase,

1124
01:07:40,250 --> 01:07:43,083
but a popular government without access

1125
01:07:43,083 --> 01:07:47,459
to popular information is but a prelude to a farce or tragedy

1126
01:07:47,459 --> 01:07:49,459
or maybe both.

1127
01:07:49,792 --> 01:07:51,999
What it is meant by that, if you are going to have

1128
01:07:51,999 --> 01:07:55,542
a democracy where people are voting about the representatives and

1129
01:07:55,542 --> 01:07:59,083
the representatives are voting on the laws, but we don't know what

1130
01:07:59,083 --> 01:08:01,209
is really going on or don't have access

1131
01:08:01,209 --> 01:08:04,083
to full information, it is a farce.

1132
01:08:04,459 --> 01:08:06,167
We are not able to have a functioning democracy

1133
01:08:06,167 --> 01:08:09,918
without a good amount of information and transparency.

1134
01:08:10,209 --> 01:08:14,209
I just wanted to add one quick thing, which is that one

1135
01:08:14,209 --> 01:08:18,999
of the reasons why EFF is made up of activists, technologists

1136
01:08:18,999 --> 01:08:24,542
and lawyers is that sometimes the answer is not litigation.

1137
01:08:24,542 --> 01:08:26,584
Or legislation.

1138
01:08:26,584 --> 01:08:28,667
Sometimes the answer is technology.

1139
01:08:28,667 --> 01:08:31,334
And one of the strongest protections that we can offer to whistle blowers

1140
01:08:31,334 --> 01:08:33,375
is strong encryption.

1141
01:08:39,542 --> 01:08:42,709
(Applause.)    If I could add a most basic level, something

1142
01:08:42,709 --> 01:08:46,083
all of us can do is get in touch with our elected representatives

1143
01:08:46,083 --> 01:08:50,209
and tell them that this is something we consider important.

1144
01:08:50,209 --> 01:08:53,834
This is an area where unfortunately for those of us who care

1145
01:08:53,834 --> 01:08:57,250
about technology, phone calls are better than e-mail

1146
01:08:57,250 --> 01:09:01,209
and personal visits to a member's office are better still,

1147
01:09:01,209 --> 01:09:03,292
but they listen.

1148
01:09:03,292 --> 01:09:06,751
And on some level that one constituent took the time to come

1149
01:09:06,751 --> 01:09:11,292
in and tell them how important this issue is to them.

1150
01:09:11,292 --> 01:09:14,999
They see that as representative of thousands of constituents.

1151
01:09:16,292 --> 01:09:18,125
AUDIENCE: Hi.

1152
01:09:18,250 --> 01:09:21,999
Regarding technology patent trolls, a much less important issue than

1153
01:09:21,999 --> 01:09:25,626
a lot of the civil liberties discussions, but can you discuss

1154
01:09:25,626 --> 01:09:28,876
the current situation with the trolls owning the idea

1155
01:09:28,876 --> 01:09:32,751
of podcasting and podcast protocols and where that stands legally

1156
01:09:32,751 --> 01:09:34,250
right now?

1157
01:09:37,999 --> 01:09:42,125
I am not the staff patent expert.

1158
01:09:42,125 --> 01:09:45,999
We have two of them, but this was

1159
01:09:45,999 --> 01:09:51,876
a person who created a pre-Internet audio

1160
01:09:51,876 --> 01:09:55,918
distribution company.

1161
01:09:55,999 --> 01:09:57,417
The idea was it had something to do

1162
01:09:57,417 --> 01:10:00,999
with sending --    AUDIENCE: Audio programs.

1163
01:10:00,999 --> 01:10:05,459
Recording programs on cassette tape to subscribers

1164
01:10:05,459 --> 01:10:12,501
in sort of a, an early version of Netflix mailing DVDs and this was

1165
01:10:12,501 --> 01:10:18,000
in the mid '90s before there was podcasting.

1166
01:10:19,167 --> 01:10:25,501
My understanding is that there may be some examples.

1167
01:10:25,501 --> 01:10:27,459
In patent law this is known as prior art.

1168
01:10:27,459 --> 01:10:30,375
This is evidence that something was invented

1169
01:10:30,375 --> 01:10:35,876
before the patent owner claims to have invented it.

1170
01:10:35,918 --> 01:10:38,751
In other words, their invention was not in fact new.

1171
01:10:38,999 --> 01:10:42,999
My understanding is there may be some prior art

1172
01:10:42,999 --> 01:10:47,751
for podcasting for the ideas that this gentleman

1173
01:10:47,751 --> 01:10:49,959
is claiming.

1174
01:10:49,999 --> 01:10:54,626
And if that's so, we may be able to get the patent office

1175
01:10:54,626 --> 01:10:58,999
to nullify that patent, which would probably end

1176
01:10:58,999 --> 01:11:02,667
the lawsuits and the threats.

1177
01:11:02,999 --> 01:11:04,417
That's what we are pursuing.

1178
01:11:04,417 --> 01:11:06,083
AUDIENCE: Good luck with that.

1179
01:11:06,083 --> 01:11:07,999
Do you have a list of prior arts ...

1180
01:11:07,999 --> 01:11:10,459
(Speaker away from microphone.)    Well,

1181
01:11:10,459 --> 01:11:14,459
there's trolling FX, which is on the particular thing,

1182
01:11:14,459 --> 01:11:17,083
the podcasting patent.

1183
01:11:17,459 --> 01:11:20,834
There is a method we are trying to gather information

1184
01:11:20,834 --> 01:11:23,918
about prior art that's out there.

1185
01:11:23,918 --> 01:11:26,999
I don't remember, but basically if you look through our blog posts

1186
01:11:26,999 --> 01:11:30,999
and see the ones about this, it will give you how you can submit prior

1187
01:11:30,999 --> 01:11:33,375
art that you're aware of.

1188
01:11:33,417 --> 01:11:39,083
Basically things from the early to mid '90s would be particularly useful.

1189
01:11:39,083 --> 01:11:40,501
It was like the patent was issued slightly

1190
01:11:40,501 --> 01:11:43,167
before the Internet archive started gathering things,

1191
01:11:43,167 --> 01:11:46,083
which has made it a little bit more difficult to look back

1192
01:11:46,083 --> 01:11:48,334
at some of the history.

1193
01:11:48,417 --> 01:11:52,167
We still have found some so far and are gathering more.

1194
01:11:52,417 --> 01:11:54,834
The other site that we maintain on that subject,

1195
01:11:54,834 --> 01:11:59,250
and I think it might be obvious, is called defendinnovation.org.

1196
01:11:59,417 --> 01:12:03,999
AUDIENCE: I have two questions.

1197
01:12:03,999 --> 01:12:06,083
One is if you guys might be able to talk

1198
01:12:06,083 --> 01:12:11,292
about a recent court ruling talking about local law enforcement not being

1199
01:12:11,292 --> 01:12:16,209
required to have a warrant to track cell phone location.

1200
01:12:16,334 --> 01:12:19,709
That's just recently come up.

1201
01:12:19,709 --> 01:12:21,292
Maybe the reasoning behind that.

1202
01:12:23,083 --> 01:12:27,459
And then the second part, the second question I've got

1203
01:12:27,459 --> 01:12:30,125
is anything on drones.

1204
01:12:30,125 --> 01:12:31,709
You guys published any list?

1205
01:12:31,918 --> 01:12:34,999
I hadn't heard anything about it and I was kind of surprised.

1206
01:12:34,999 --> 01:12:36,959
All right.

1207
01:12:36,959 --> 01:12:39,459
So let me hit the first of those questions

1208
01:12:39,459 --> 01:12:42,501
about cell phone tracking.

1209
01:12:42,709 --> 01:12:45,292
And so yeah, unfortunately there was

1210
01:12:45,292 --> 01:12:49,876
a recent case that warrants were not necessary.

1211
01:12:49,876 --> 01:12:51,667
It was an appellate court decision, two

1212
01:12:51,667 --> 01:12:55,292
out of three said you need a warrant.

1213
01:12:55,292 --> 01:12:56,542
One dissented.

1214
01:12:56,626 --> 01:13:00,083
It has actually been a mixed bag out there in the courts.

1215
01:13:00,083 --> 01:13:04,125
We've gotten some courts that have agreed that a warrant is necessary

1216
01:13:04,125 --> 01:13:07,083
to do cell phone tracking.

1217
01:13:07,375 --> 01:13:10,999
Actually, if you look at the recent Supreme Court case

1218
01:13:10,999 --> 01:13:13,334
from last year, U.S.

1219
01:13:13,334 --> 01:13:15,959
versus Jones talking about a GPS tracker being used

1220
01:13:15,959 --> 01:13:17,999
to track someone.

1221
01:13:17,999 --> 01:13:20,083
They said a warrant was required for that.

1222
01:13:20,083 --> 01:13:23,250
I think if that case is properly extended to the cell phones,

1223
01:13:23,250 --> 01:13:26,083
it should come to a similar conclusion that

1224
01:13:26,083 --> 01:13:28,584
a warrant is required.

1225
01:13:28,918 --> 01:13:31,083
Unfortunately there was that decision.

1226
01:13:31,083 --> 01:13:35,292
We are continuing to work on this and try to find cases that are going

1227
01:13:35,292 --> 01:13:37,999
to be good opportunities to show that

1228
01:13:37,999 --> 01:13:42,918
the Fourth Amendment applies to cell phone information.

1229
01:13:42,918 --> 01:13:43,999
An I add?

1230
01:13:43,999 --> 01:13:44,999
Please.

1231
01:13:44,999 --> 01:13:46,584
Because I have been here and I have been crazy busy

1232
01:13:46,584 --> 01:13:49,167
and this case just came out earlier this week, I haven't read

1233
01:13:49,167 --> 01:13:50,999
the opinion yet.

1234
01:13:50,999 --> 01:13:54,375
What I understand from the reporting is that the rationale that

1235
01:13:54,375 --> 01:13:58,876
the court adopted was based on the third-party doctrine.

1236
01:13:58,876 --> 01:14:01,876
And this is something that you guys all ought to know about.

1237
01:14:01,876 --> 01:14:05,167
And really have on your radars.

1238
01:14:05,167 --> 01:14:07,626
So the deal is, the Fourth Amendment

1239
01:14:07,626 --> 01:14:10,167
as a general matter, right, protects you

1240
01:14:10,167 --> 01:14:14,834
against unreasonable government searches and seizures.

1241
01:14:14,834 --> 01:14:17,417
So the government is supposed to have a warrant

1242
01:14:17,417 --> 01:14:19,999
to search something in which you have

1243
01:14:19,999 --> 01:14:23,999
a reasonable expectation of privacy unless some exception

1244
01:14:23,999 --> 01:14:25,999
applies, okay?

1245
01:14:26,209 --> 01:14:27,792
That's the general rule.

1246
01:14:27,999 --> 01:14:30,999
So back in the '70s the Supreme Court decided

1247
01:14:30,999 --> 01:14:33,250
a couple of cases.

1248
01:14:34,834 --> 01:14:38,542
One involving bank records and one involving

1249
01:14:38,542 --> 01:14:42,918
the numbers that a telephone company collects when

1250
01:14:42,918 --> 01:14:45,125
you dial a call.

1251
01:14:45,292 --> 01:14:48,334
And in those cases the Supreme Court basically said you

1252
01:14:48,334 --> 01:14:50,999
don't have a reasonable expectation of privacy

1253
01:14:50,999 --> 01:14:55,083
in information that you convey to a third-party like that.

1254
01:14:55,083 --> 01:14:56,167
Like a company, right?

1255
01:14:56,626 --> 01:14:58,876
Your bank records, your financial information that you

1256
01:14:58,876 --> 01:15:01,083
convey to a bank, they create records from, and

1257
01:15:01,083 --> 01:15:03,999
the numbers you dial that you convey to a phone company,

1258
01:15:03,999 --> 01:15:07,292
you don't have any reasonable expectation of privacy in a situation

1259
01:15:07,292 --> 01:15:11,459
like that, and the reason is you know that you're giving it up.

1260
01:15:11,459 --> 01:15:15,083
You are voluntarily giving this information over to them.

1261
01:15:15,083 --> 01:15:16,083
How can you have a reasonable expectation

1262
01:15:16,083 --> 01:15:17,999
of privacy in that?

1263
01:15:18,125 --> 01:15:20,999
That has developed into this concept that we call

1264
01:15:20,999 --> 01:15:23,501
the third-party doctrine, which broadly seems

1265
01:15:23,501 --> 01:15:27,292
to suggest that you don't have any reasonable expectation of privacy

1266
01:15:27,292 --> 01:15:30,834
in anything that you give to a third-party.

1267
01:15:31,125 --> 01:15:35,584
In this day and age where we store so much information with companies

1268
01:15:35,584 --> 01:15:40,167
like Google, Facebook, Microsoft, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera,

1269
01:15:40,167 --> 01:15:43,667
that's a very dangerous precedent.

1270
01:15:43,751 --> 01:15:48,083
And that is something that we need to make go away.

1271
01:15:48,083 --> 01:15:50,959
It just doesn't translate to the world we live in now.

1272
01:15:50,959 --> 01:15:55,999
And in the case that Kurt spoke about, the Supreme Court Justice Sotomayor

1273
01:15:55,999 --> 01:16:02,125
called this out and said this is something that we've got to look at.

1274
01:16:02,334 --> 01:16:06,083
So I think you are going to see a lot of cases in the future dealing with this.

1275
01:16:06,083 --> 01:16:07,876
I think the fifth circuit, from what I've read, has really gone

1276
01:16:07,876 --> 01:16:10,417
the wrong way because they said they are cell phone records and

1277
01:16:10,417 --> 01:16:12,918
they are stored with your company.

1278
01:16:13,999 --> 01:16:15,999
That's very problematic.

1279
01:16:15,999 --> 01:16:19,083
I think you're going to hear a lot about this in the coming years.

1280
01:16:19,501 --> 01:16:20,501
Yeah.

1281
01:16:20,501 --> 01:16:22,542
So speaking of reasonable expectations of privacy,

1282
01:16:22,542 --> 01:16:25,999
and the next question was about drones.

1283
01:16:25,999 --> 01:16:29,709
So recently the FBI responded to, I believe it was Senator Leahy

1284
01:16:29,709 --> 01:16:33,626
explaining what the standard is for drones.

1285
01:16:33,626 --> 01:16:38,834
They took the position that you did not have a reasonable expectation

1286
01:16:38,834 --> 01:16:41,999
of privacy against drones.

1287
01:16:41,999 --> 01:16:44,375
That is to say it was not reasonable to expect that you would be private

1288
01:16:44,375 --> 01:16:47,083
from a drone circling over your house and taking pictures

1289
01:16:47,083 --> 01:16:49,999
of what you're doing in your backyard.

1290
01:16:49,999 --> 01:16:52,542
They based on some cases that were involved

1291
01:16:52,542 --> 01:16:56,167
like man playing surveillance that had been done in the course

1292
01:16:56,167 --> 01:16:58,125
of the drug war.

1293
01:16:58,626 --> 01:17:03,999
And this is a sort of illustrative of how things have been going

1294
01:17:03,999 --> 01:17:07,999
in terms of government surveillance.

1295
01:17:07,999 --> 01:17:11,125
They are looking for cases in which there have been statements

1296
01:17:11,125 --> 01:17:15,209
about what reasonable expectation of privacy is.

1297
01:17:15,459 --> 01:17:18,292
That have stemmed from some particular circumstances.

1298
01:17:18,292 --> 01:17:21,125
And then seeing how far they can be applied.

1299
01:17:21,125 --> 01:17:22,834
So they find a court that says at some point

1300
01:17:22,834 --> 01:17:24,667
a plane flew somewhere and looked

1301
01:17:24,667 --> 01:17:27,250
down and there was not a reasonable expectation

1302
01:17:27,250 --> 01:17:29,375
of privacy on that.

1303
01:17:29,375 --> 01:17:33,751
That also means there could be a drone 24/7 hanging over your house.

1304
01:17:34,083 --> 01:17:37,417
Once they establish that there is not a reasonable expectation

1305
01:17:37,417 --> 01:17:42,083
of privacy they can take it to the Nth degree and it doesn't matter.

1306
01:17:42,083 --> 01:17:43,542
It really does matter.

1307
01:17:43,751 --> 01:17:47,709
It is entirely possible that a police officer would follow you

1308
01:17:47,709 --> 01:17:50,959
around where you go, A, and make handwritten Notes

1309
01:17:50,959 --> 01:17:54,999
about where you are going and what you are doing.

1310
01:17:55,834 --> 01:17:58,999
This does not mean that it is a good society.

1311
01:17:58,999 --> 01:18:00,584
A society that, a future that we would want to live

1312
01:18:00,584 --> 01:18:04,334
in where everybody's movements are tracked all of the time.

1313
01:18:04,792 --> 01:18:08,999
(Applause.)    And so this is made the third-party doctrine,

1314
01:18:08,999 --> 01:18:14,584
the reasonable expectation of privacy is outdated and becoming misused

1315
01:18:14,584 --> 01:18:19,083
to take things which, beware occasional things where there

1316
01:18:19,083 --> 01:18:22,626
was a natural limit of resource-based limit

1317
01:18:22,626 --> 01:18:27,417
to how much the government can do, when things become cheaper

1318
01:18:27,417 --> 01:18:30,709
they can do it all the time.

1319
01:18:30,751 --> 01:18:34,501
We are very much working on trying to stop that.

1320
01:18:34,501 --> 01:18:37,999
To wrap up on drones so the people on this panel right now are not our

1321
01:18:37,999 --> 01:18:42,083
drones experts, but one of them actually is here.

1322
01:18:42,083 --> 01:18:45,667
Our colleague Parker Higgins, who is going to be in the contest area,

1323
01:18:45,667 --> 01:18:48,209
working the CFAA phone booth.

1324
01:18:48,209 --> 01:18:52,626
If you have questions about drones, he knows a lot about them.

1325
01:18:52,999 --> 01:18:54,709
AUDIENCE: At the same time that

1326
01:18:54,709 --> 01:18:58,999
the NSA penopticon was discussed it also seemed to be apparent that

1327
01:18:58,999 --> 01:19:02,959
the government was going to top tier providers and asking them

1328
01:19:02,959 --> 01:19:05,999
to give up their encryption keys.

1329
01:19:05,999 --> 01:19:10,709
I don't think the subject has gotten to this extent yesterday,

1330
01:19:10,709 --> 01:19:15,999
but what does that do to the concept of non-repudiation and contract law

1331
01:19:15,999 --> 01:19:20,999
or even chain of evidence, digital evidence where our digital I had

1332
01:19:20,999 --> 01:19:25,292
identities are now no longer solely our own.

1333
01:19:25,501 --> 01:19:28,999
Or to put it another way, if the whole ...

1334
01:19:33,792 --> 01:19:35,083
if the ...

1335
01:19:38,501 --> 01:19:40,375
Let me help.

1336
01:19:40,375 --> 01:19:42,626
The question is raising the possibility that

1337
01:19:42,626 --> 01:19:46,083
as you may be communicating in what you believe to be

1338
01:19:46,083 --> 01:19:49,959
an encrypted channel, that nevertheless someone might be

1339
01:19:49,959 --> 01:19:52,542
forced to give up the key such that your

1340
01:19:52,542 --> 01:19:56,959
communications could be decrypted and you wouldn't have the level

1341
01:19:56,959 --> 01:20:00,999
of security that you are --    AUDIENCE: The phrase I'm looking

1342
01:20:00,999 --> 01:20:03,999
for is back door key escrow.

1343
01:20:04,209 --> 01:20:09,167
That's my digital entity, my uniqueness and non-repudiation

1344
01:20:09,167 --> 01:20:12,876
suddenly evaporates and becomes negligible

1345
01:20:12,876 --> 01:20:15,250
as a point of law.

1346
01:20:15,250 --> 01:20:16,751
Hmm.

1347
01:20:16,751 --> 01:20:19,667
Well, I have not thought of it in terms of the digital identity

1348
01:20:19,667 --> 01:20:22,709
because usually what we have been hearing about is more

1349
01:20:22,709 --> 01:20:26,459
on the encrypting communications channel not as an encryption method,

1350
01:20:26,459 --> 01:20:29,292
not as a digital signature method.

1351
01:20:30,834 --> 01:20:33,999
But nevertheless it is quite troubling that we have

1352
01:20:33,999 --> 01:20:37,125
a number of systems that are designed to be able

1353
01:20:37,125 --> 01:20:40,999
to encrypt communications using a public key infrastructure

1354
01:20:40,999 --> 01:20:43,042
and certificates.

1355
01:20:43,584 --> 01:20:46,584
These systems have a lot of problems.

1356
01:20:46,584 --> 01:20:48,667
I think what Dan was talking about earlier, some of our attempts

1357
01:20:48,667 --> 01:20:52,584
to try to at least investigate and understand those problems.

1358
01:20:52,584 --> 01:20:54,959
I guess we can put it this way.

1359
01:20:54,959 --> 01:20:56,709
The more that is known and revealed

1360
01:20:56,709 --> 01:21:01,209
about government access to encryption keys, the more likely it

1361
01:21:01,209 --> 01:21:04,417
is that a good lawyer in a contract dispute

1362
01:21:04,417 --> 01:21:08,959
or anything involving chain of digital evidence will be able

1363
01:21:08,959 --> 01:21:12,999
to convince a jury that the contract was forged or that

1364
01:21:12,999 --> 01:21:16,083
the evidence was manufactured.

1365
01:21:16,083 --> 01:21:17,999
So that's, that risking increase.

1366
01:21:17,999 --> 01:21:19,083
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

1367
01:21:19,083 --> 01:21:22,792
Just quickly to add one last point to that, I think that it's

1368
01:21:22,792 --> 01:21:25,209
a really good question.

1369
01:21:25,209 --> 01:21:27,709
I understand you as saying providers having to give

1370
01:21:27,709 --> 01:21:31,999
over their private encryption keys to law enforcement.

1371
01:21:32,459 --> 01:21:36,125
I think that this, there's kind of a hole right now in terms

1372
01:21:36,125 --> 01:21:38,918
of statutes about this.

1373
01:21:38,918 --> 01:21:40,999
So law tends to focus on user data.

1374
01:21:40,999 --> 01:21:43,667
But there's a big question mark about well, yeah,

1375
01:21:43,667 --> 01:21:46,667
you can get user data if you have these keys

1376
01:21:46,667 --> 01:21:51,167
and are companies forced to hand over the keys under various warrant

1377
01:21:51,167 --> 01:21:53,999
or subpoena circumstances?

1378
01:21:53,999 --> 01:21:56,999
I think there's just a lot of unclarity about that right now.

1379
01:21:56,999 --> 01:21:59,083
It's something that is really alarming.

1380
01:21:59,083 --> 01:22:04,125
I want to adjust one sort of general point on this.

1381
01:22:04,209 --> 01:22:05,209
You know, companies may be required

1382
01:22:05,209 --> 01:22:07,834
to provide some technical assistance to the government when

1383
01:22:07,834 --> 01:22:09,709
they want to wiretap.

1384
01:22:09,709 --> 01:22:12,834
But there's also a notion that they shouldn't be required

1385
01:22:12,834 --> 01:22:15,417
to break their services.

1386
01:22:15,584 --> 01:22:18,999
And I think if your service is involved providing encrypted

1387
01:22:18,999 --> 01:22:22,751
communications and you are not actually providing it, that breaks

1388
01:22:22,751 --> 01:22:26,626
the service and that may be an available argument.

1389
01:22:30,999 --> 01:22:33,459
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

1390
01:22:33,459 --> 01:22:34,459
AUDIENCE: Hi.

1391
01:22:34,459 --> 01:22:37,459
So since this Snowden revelation, I have been trying to think about,

1392
01:22:37,459 --> 01:22:41,709
there's three different contexts for data retention.

1393
01:22:41,709 --> 01:22:43,167
There's the NSA program we just learned

1394
01:22:43,167 --> 01:22:45,999
about and the data retention that my service

1395
01:22:45,999 --> 01:22:49,876
provider is doing of my metadata of their own volition and this

1396
01:22:49,876 --> 01:22:52,209
is in the United States.

1397
01:22:52,209 --> 01:22:55,083
There is internationally how the data retention works.

1398
01:22:55,083 --> 01:22:56,083
My understanding is that in Europe it's more regulated than it

1399
01:22:56,083 --> 01:22:57,501
is here.

1400
01:22:57,918 --> 01:23:00,667
I ask you if you wouldn't mind characterizing

1401
01:23:00,667 --> 01:23:03,751
the difference between the three contexts,

1402
01:23:03,751 --> 01:23:07,834
how long my data is retained and how much it is exposed

1403
01:23:07,834 --> 01:23:11,999
to access by the government with an eye to what you think

1404
01:23:11,999 --> 01:23:14,584
the right answers are.

1405
01:23:17,834 --> 01:23:20,209
So I can talk a little bit.

1406
01:23:20,459 --> 01:23:22,792
If you want to add ...

1407
01:23:22,918 --> 01:23:26,459
To Europe, I understand, is kind of a mixed bag.

1408
01:23:26,626 --> 01:23:33,459
There is greater protection in terms of user data and how it is handled.

1409
01:23:33,459 --> 01:23:35,167
On the other hand, there are also mandatory data retention

1410
01:23:35,167 --> 01:23:38,292
laws which we do not have in the United States.

1411
01:23:38,292 --> 01:23:39,999
It's a double edged sword.

1412
01:23:40,876 --> 01:23:42,999
But beyond those mandatory data retention

1413
01:23:42,999 --> 01:23:48,125
laws, I think as I said earlier it's the wild west and the private sector.

1414
01:23:48,417 --> 01:23:51,501
It's up to the company how long they want to retain your data.

1415
01:23:51,667 --> 01:23:55,999
They can have private policies right now which disclose that.

1416
01:23:55,999 --> 01:23:59,083
If they break those privacy policies they open themselves

1417
01:23:59,083 --> 01:24:03,834
up to FTC complaints or possible other lawsuits, class action lawsuits,

1418
01:24:03,834 --> 01:24:06,375
this sort of thick thing.

1419
01:24:06,792 --> 01:24:08,999
Basically there's no information.

1420
01:24:08,999 --> 01:24:14,751
In terms of -- there's no limit to what data they can retain.

1421
01:24:16,167 --> 01:24:20,459
On that front, I think the right answer is a lot of transparency

1422
01:24:20,459 --> 01:24:23,959
from companies and also ensuring that we don't pass

1423
01:24:23,959 --> 01:24:26,999
a mandatory data retention law.

1424
01:24:26,999 --> 01:24:31,125
If a VPN doesn't want to keep data, they shouldn't have to.

1425
01:24:31,125 --> 01:24:33,209
So I think that's the way that we should be going

1426
01:24:33,209 --> 01:24:35,626
for the private sector.

1427
01:24:35,626 --> 01:24:38,751
With respect to government data, I don't know if someone else wants

1428
01:24:38,751 --> 01:24:43,626
to take that, but I also think that there's no clear rules about it.

1429
01:24:43,626 --> 01:24:46,083
I think there's one more important point to make

1430
01:24:46,083 --> 01:24:49,501
about the private sector in the United States, especially

1431
01:24:49,501 --> 01:24:53,918
in Silicon Valley where you have a lot of startups and people are sitting

1432
01:24:53,918 --> 01:24:56,083
on a lot of user data.

1433
01:24:56,083 --> 01:25:01,167
There is a tendency among engineers to want to save everything.

1434
01:25:01,751 --> 01:25:04,417
Because you never know when it's going to be useful.

1435
01:25:04,417 --> 01:25:05,626
(Laughter.)    Yeah.

1436
01:25:05,626 --> 01:25:06,834
In fact, your company might go completely

1437
01:25:06,834 --> 01:25:10,125
under and that might be the only thing that you can sell.

1438
01:25:10,250 --> 01:25:15,501
So there's a very strong push to retain as much data as possible

1439
01:25:15,501 --> 01:25:18,459
for as long as possible.

1440
01:25:18,542 --> 01:25:20,709
Saving data is cheap, backups are cheap,

1441
01:25:20,709 --> 01:25:25,999
the consequences of not having the data when you need it are dire.

1442
01:25:25,999 --> 01:25:28,375
And deletion is computationally expensive.

1443
01:25:28,375 --> 01:25:31,209
So usually when sort of Silicon Valley companies have

1444
01:25:31,209 --> 01:25:34,334
a choice between storing everything indefinitely

1445
01:25:34,334 --> 01:25:38,292
and finding some way to regularly delete it, they will choose

1446
01:25:38,292 --> 01:25:42,918
to just store it all indefinitely because it's easier.

1447
01:25:42,918 --> 01:25:45,626
It is not a conspiracy against user data.

1448
01:25:45,626 --> 01:25:47,375
It is not a conspiracy to make things more convenient

1449
01:25:47,375 --> 01:25:49,375
for the government.

1450
01:25:49,999 --> 01:25:53,334
If you've ever walked into an engineer's office and saw piles

1451
01:25:53,334 --> 01:25:56,167
of paper and notice they never throw anything away,

1452
01:25:56,167 --> 01:25:59,167
it's sort of an out growth of that.

1453
01:25:59,209 --> 01:26:01,542
And in some ways that is potentially very,

1454
01:26:01,542 --> 01:26:05,375
very worrying because even if you don't have mandatory data

1455
01:26:05,375 --> 01:26:08,250
retention in this manner, sometimes you wind

1456
01:26:08,250 --> 01:26:11,542
up having de facto data retention.

1457
01:26:12,999 --> 01:26:17,375
So to address the government storing end of it,

1458
01:26:17,375 --> 01:26:23,999
the question is are they supposed to have it in the first place?

1459
01:26:23,999 --> 01:26:26,459
And the problem with some of these sort

1460
01:26:26,459 --> 01:26:31,999
of mass storage things that have been confirmed recently with reports

1461
01:26:31,999 --> 01:26:37,167
about the NSA getting just gigantic piles -- five years, that's what

1462
01:26:37,167 --> 01:26:40,083
they say they are doing.

1463
01:26:40,209 --> 01:26:44,918
Actually if your information is encrypted it's until it's decrypted.

1464
01:26:45,209 --> 01:26:47,542
They will keep it around forever.

1465
01:26:48,999 --> 01:26:51,999
Or at least until they figure out how to decrypt it.

1466
01:26:51,999 --> 01:26:55,834
So the problem is really, that they get it in the first place.

1467
01:26:55,999 --> 01:26:59,125
They should only be able to get the information when

1468
01:26:59,125 --> 01:27:03,709
they meet legal standards and then only keep it so long as it is needed

1469
01:27:03,709 --> 01:27:06,083
for that valid purpose.

1470
01:27:06,083 --> 01:27:09,083
If that helps answer the question.

1471
01:27:09,083 --> 01:27:16,626
AUDIENCE: With regard to the development of the U.S.

1472
01:27:16,626 --> 01:27:19,083
cyber warfare, the architecture -- I don't know

1473
01:27:19,083 --> 01:27:24,209
if that's a correct word, but it seems like our government has been

1474
01:27:24,209 --> 01:27:27,999
penetrated multiple times by groups like LOLSIC,

1475
01:27:27,999 --> 01:27:31,876
while statement we developed advanced cyber weapons

1476
01:27:31,876 --> 01:27:37,375
like Stuxnet and regularly are tapping into other countries.

1477
01:27:38,999 --> 01:27:41,209
Could you speculate on that?

1478
01:27:41,375 --> 01:27:43,709
Yes, yes.

1479
01:27:43,834 --> 01:27:46,918
(Laughter.)    EVA GALPERIN: Sure, I can speculate on that.

1480
01:27:46,918 --> 01:27:47,417
We actually don't have to speculate

1481
01:27:47,417 --> 01:27:50,125
because the White House released this thing called

1482
01:27:50,125 --> 01:27:52,999
the Presidential Policy Directive.

1483
01:27:52,999 --> 01:27:56,542
It is a document that the president creates that instructs

1484
01:27:56,542 --> 01:28:00,167
the divisions and the cabinet agencies about what

1485
01:28:00,167 --> 01:28:03,999
the policy is for the administration.

1486
01:28:03,999 --> 01:28:09,834
And so the document actually is part of the Snowden leaks.

1487
01:28:09,834 --> 01:28:10,209
What came out was that it was

1488
01:28:10,209 --> 01:28:13,501
a classified Presidential policy directive.

1489
01:28:13,876 --> 01:28:16,125
The Presidential Policy Directive Number 20.

1490
01:28:16,501 --> 01:28:20,959
What it did was it kind of confirmed what a lot of academics,

1491
01:28:20,959 --> 01:28:25,334
people in the security research, people who were watching where

1492
01:28:25,334 --> 01:28:28,834
the government is going with this online warfare

1493
01:28:28,834 --> 01:28:33,751
and virus making, malware making and what it did is, it revealed that

1494
01:28:33,751 --> 01:28:38,209
they have pretty much rootinized the processes and are beginning

1495
01:28:38,209 --> 01:28:41,751
to study and look into and create working groups

1496
01:28:41,751 --> 01:28:45,959
for how the government is going to deal with this and what

1497
01:28:45,959 --> 01:28:48,999
the government is going to do.

1498
01:28:49,584 --> 01:28:53,751
Before this document we saw very vague outlines, right?

1499
01:28:53,751 --> 01:28:55,083
Like the U.S.

1500
01:28:55,083 --> 01:28:57,959
government will follow the laws of war.

1501
01:28:57,959 --> 01:28:58,959
The U.S.

1502
01:28:58,959 --> 01:29:02,501
government will, we will follow the U.N.

1503
01:29:02,501 --> 01:29:03,501
conventions.

1504
01:29:03,501 --> 01:29:04,959
And international law.

1505
01:29:04,999 --> 01:29:09,584
What this document revealed was that a, it got into much greater detail

1506
01:29:09,584 --> 01:29:13,999
on what the government is doing, how they will act in defense

1507
01:29:13,999 --> 01:29:18,959
if they support any sort of exfiltration of data or if they suppose

1508
01:29:18,959 --> 01:29:22,292
they are under any type of attack.

1509
01:29:22,751 --> 01:29:26,999
And the document provided a pretty good foundation for how

1510
01:29:26,999 --> 01:29:29,792
they justify Stuxnet.

1511
01:29:30,125 --> 01:29:36,292
We know now within the past couple of weeks that one of the generals

1512
01:29:36,292 --> 01:29:43,375
is being investigated over leaking the fact that Stuxnet was a U.S.

1513
01:29:43,375 --> 01:29:44,751
Israeli project.

1514
01:29:44,751 --> 01:29:48,542
And so what we are seeing right now and what we are paying a lot

1515
01:29:48,542 --> 01:29:53,751
of attention to and fighting against is the increased militarization

1516
01:29:53,751 --> 01:29:55,999
of the Internet.

1517
01:29:56,167 --> 01:29:58,751
It was something that was always in the background,

1518
01:29:58,751 --> 01:30:02,667
something that we were always hesitant in watching and thought what

1519
01:30:02,667 --> 01:30:04,459
was happening.

1520
01:30:04,459 --> 01:30:06,876
What we are seeing now is yes, it's happening.

1521
01:30:06,959 --> 01:30:09,959
The government is creating these things

1522
01:30:09,959 --> 01:30:15,999
and there's hardly anything to be regulating it or figuring out how

1523
01:30:15,999 --> 01:30:19,999
to stop it and what to do about it.

1524
01:30:19,999 --> 01:30:22,125
Because we don't know what they are doing.

1525
01:30:22,125 --> 01:30:24,042
So I think what is going to happen and especially part

1526
01:30:24,042 --> 01:30:27,375
of the transparency efforts we're fighting for is to talk

1527
01:30:27,375 --> 01:30:31,209
with the government and issue these policy papers and what we think,

1528
01:30:31,209 --> 01:30:34,792
you know, should happen in this area and what we think really

1529
01:30:34,792 --> 01:30:37,709
shouldn't happen with the increasing militarization

1530
01:30:37,709 --> 01:30:39,584
of the Internet.

1531
01:30:40,542 --> 01:30:45,250
With Stuxnet -- Flame is another good example -- now when

1532
01:30:45,250 --> 01:30:49,667
you use an online virus it is different.

1533
01:30:49,999 --> 01:30:53,709
You are no longer -- you can try as hard as you may to target

1534
01:30:53,709 --> 01:30:58,999
a foreign nation state or something you want to exfiltrate from a government,

1535
01:30:58,999 --> 01:31:02,375
but it's hopping the Internet, right?

1536
01:31:02,375 --> 01:31:03,999
It's hopping the Internet into the public sphere

1537
01:31:03,999 --> 01:31:07,083
and causing citizens and causing individuals not associated

1538
01:31:07,083 --> 01:31:11,542
with the government and who aren't supposed to be your targets.

1539
01:31:11,999 --> 01:31:15,999
And it's something that is very dangerous that is happening.

1540
01:31:15,999 --> 01:31:18,999
I just wanted to interrupt for a second rudely and talk

1541
01:31:18,999 --> 01:31:23,125
a little bit about the rhetoric of cyber warfare.

1542
01:31:23,125 --> 01:31:27,667
One of the very interesting things that came out of the Presidential directive

1543
01:31:27,667 --> 01:31:30,999
was the sort of declaration that cyber space had

1544
01:31:30,999 --> 01:31:34,999
been sort of declared to be a theater of war.

1545
01:31:35,250 --> 01:31:38,125
And I think that one of the biggest problems when it comes

1546
01:31:38,125 --> 01:31:41,626
to talking about this stuff with the U.S.

1547
01:31:41,626 --> 01:31:43,292
government is that there is an entire culture

1548
01:31:43,292 --> 01:31:45,876
of people who say cyber.

1549
01:31:45,959 --> 01:31:47,792
(Laughter.)    EVA GALPERIN: Which is generally

1550
01:31:47,792 --> 01:31:50,999
a good sign that you are talking to someone who has very little

1551
01:31:50,999 --> 01:31:54,501
in common with the Electronic Frontier Foundation.

1552
01:31:54,999 --> 01:31:58,083
The biggest problem with the term cyber warfare

1553
01:31:58,083 --> 01:32:01,209
is that packets are not bullets.

1554
01:32:01,209 --> 01:32:04,083
As a general rule they do not kill people.

1555
01:32:04,083 --> 01:32:07,918
Once you start using the rhetoric of warfare and guns and bullets

1556
01:32:07,918 --> 01:32:12,375
and cyber bombs and cyber shields and cyber tanks or whatever it

1557
01:32:12,375 --> 01:32:14,709
is they are using.

1558
01:32:14,792 --> 01:32:16,999
Cyber Pearl Harbor.

1559
01:32:16,999 --> 01:32:18,999
EVA GALPERIN: I would real lie like to know what this cyber Pearl

1560
01:32:18,999 --> 01:32:22,501
Harbor is that we have been promised for so many years.

1561
01:32:22,792 --> 01:32:26,999
Once you use this rhetoric it leads you to all kind

1562
01:32:26,999 --> 01:32:30,167
of erroneous conclusions about what kind

1563
01:32:30,167 --> 01:32:34,584
of protections we need and what the U.S.

1564
01:32:34,584 --> 01:32:35,999
can do and what the U.S.

1565
01:32:35,999 --> 01:32:41,959
is justified in doing in protecting sort of the American Internet as much

1566
01:32:41,959 --> 01:32:45,999
as there is an American Internet.

1567
01:32:46,083 --> 01:32:49,334
So I'm generally very wary of the term cyber warfare

1568
01:32:49,334 --> 01:32:52,125
and anything that begins with cyber and

1569
01:32:52,125 --> 01:32:56,167
the entire war rhetoric because I think it really frames

1570
01:32:56,167 --> 01:32:59,999
the problem in a highly misleading way.

1571
01:33:01,792 --> 01:33:05,375
I'll just add, it's also seriously blurring

1572
01:33:05,375 --> 01:33:10,167
the distinction between a civilian and military when it comes

1573
01:33:10,167 --> 01:33:12,501
to the Internet.

1574
01:33:13,918 --> 01:33:17,209
EVA GALPERIN: A lot of the things that we have been reading

1575
01:33:17,209 --> 01:33:21,501
about, sort of proposed protections for the U.S., for U.S.

1576
01:33:21,501 --> 01:33:24,751
cyber space have to do with protecting U.S.

1577
01:33:24,751 --> 01:33:26,250
companies' trade secrets.

1578
01:33:26,250 --> 01:33:31,918
And honestly, as far as I can tell, that's not a valid military objective.

1579
01:33:31,999 --> 01:33:35,125
You know who protects companies' trade secrets?

1580
01:33:35,125 --> 01:33:38,083
Companies who have hopefully many people employed

1581
01:33:38,083 --> 01:33:41,417
to protect their own security.

1582
01:33:41,417 --> 01:33:43,209
This should not be something that American tax dollars pay

1583
01:33:43,209 --> 01:33:46,417
for and should not be something that the U.S.

1584
01:33:46,417 --> 01:33:47,417
military does.

1585
01:33:53,125 --> 01:33:59,417
(Applause.)    AUDIENCE: My question is regarding the EFF's thoughts

1586
01:33:59,417 --> 01:34:04,542
about the Web filtering happening in the U.K.

1587
01:34:04,918 --> 01:34:07,999
originally slated as being for pornography blocking

1588
01:34:07,999 --> 01:34:13,918
but since has been revealed to spread to other subject matter the.

1589
01:34:13,918 --> 01:34:18,375
And what if any actions are being taken in regards to that?

1590
01:34:22,375 --> 01:34:25,999
(Sighing.)    Oh, British Internet, we can't take you anywhere.

1591
01:34:27,584 --> 01:34:30,999
What is particularly interesting about the U.K.

1592
01:34:31,083 --> 01:34:36,167
pornography filters is, to begin with, these are not mandatory filters

1593
01:34:36,167 --> 01:34:38,083
in any way.

1594
01:34:38,083 --> 01:34:44,667
But what is happening is that every household in the U.K.

1595
01:34:44,999 --> 01:34:51,959
will have porn filtering turned on by default by the major ISP

1596
01:34:51,959 --> 01:34:54,083
in the U.K.

1597
01:34:54,083 --> 01:34:58,834
And if you want porn, you have to make an affirmative decision

1598
01:34:58,834 --> 01:35:02,918
to contact your ISP and ask for porn.

1599
01:35:02,918 --> 01:35:05,083
(Chuckles.)    EVA GALPERIN: And they really don't see what

1600
01:35:05,083 --> 01:35:08,709
the possible chilling effect of such a thing might be.

1601
01:35:08,751 --> 01:35:12,375
Really the chilling effect shouldn't matter because children ...

1602
01:35:17,417 --> 01:35:18,125
(Some laughter and applause.)    EVA GALPERIN:

1603
01:35:18,125 --> 01:35:20,125
Needless to say this is a terrible idea.

1604
01:35:20,125 --> 01:35:24,542
EFF frequently comes out against porn filtering.

1605
01:35:24,542 --> 01:35:27,083
We think it's fine if you decide to put it on your computer,

1606
01:35:27,083 --> 01:35:28,999
on your network.

1607
01:35:28,999 --> 01:35:32,501
But having this sort of tyranny of defaults in which you have

1608
01:35:32,501 --> 01:35:37,250
to make a rather public disclosure to someone else that you want porn

1609
01:35:37,250 --> 01:35:42,209
is highly, highly problematic and poses a potential chilling effect not

1610
01:35:42,209 --> 01:35:46,999
to mention that it looks like the fillers are blocking things other

1611
01:35:46,999 --> 01:35:48,999
than just porn.

1612
01:35:49,334 --> 01:35:53,083
And that this really gives the power to sensor the Internet to these ISPs

1613
01:35:53,083 --> 01:35:56,709
and to the people building the black lists.

1614
01:35:56,709 --> 01:35:59,626
We think that black lists in general are a terrible idea.

1615
01:35:59,626 --> 01:36:02,626
They don't work and they block all the wrong stuff.

1616
01:36:02,709 --> 01:36:05,876
AUDIENCE: So I'm actually from the U.K.

1617
01:36:07,667 --> 01:36:10,459
(Laughter.)    EVA GALPERIN: Would you like porn?

1618
01:36:10,459 --> 01:36:13,292
AUDIENCE: So I'm really looking forward to moving back

1619
01:36:13,292 --> 01:36:17,083
into my parents' new house and finding one of two situations,

1620
01:36:17,083 --> 01:36:21,584
either the porn filter is off and I'm hung out to dry.

1621
01:36:22,209 --> 01:36:25,584
Sorry, the porn filter is on and I'm hung out to dry or

1622
01:36:25,584 --> 01:36:28,209
the porn filter is often and I know something

1623
01:36:28,209 --> 01:36:31,751
about my dad that I didn't need to know.

1624
01:36:31,751 --> 01:36:35,459
EVA GALPERIN: Or something about your mom that you didn't need

1625
01:36:35,459 --> 01:36:36,999
to know.

1626
01:36:37,334 --> 01:36:39,834
AUDIENCE: My bad.

1627
01:36:40,083 --> 01:36:42,375
She doesn't know anything about computers.

1628
01:36:42,375 --> 01:36:44,999
Back to data retention, you said that with a lot

1629
01:36:44,999 --> 01:36:49,999
of these startup companies, you know, data can be, if a company goes

1630
01:36:49,999 --> 01:36:53,834
under the only thing they have left.

1631
01:36:54,250 --> 01:36:56,501
I was actually, to add to that I would say that data

1632
01:36:56,501 --> 01:36:59,667
is the only commodity they have in the first place.

1633
01:36:59,667 --> 01:37:00,167
The best way to make sure it doesn't get

1634
01:37:00,167 --> 01:37:02,999
in the wrong hands is just not to give it to them.

1635
01:37:04,083 --> 01:37:07,626
My real question was about Prism.

1636
01:37:07,667 --> 01:37:10,999
So being from Europe, you guys actually have nothing

1637
01:37:10,999 --> 01:37:13,083
to worry about as American citizens

1638
01:37:13,083 --> 01:37:17,999
because the president doesn't actually target you guys, if what the NSA says

1639
01:37:17,999 --> 01:37:19,999
is to be believed.

1640
01:37:19,999 --> 01:37:22,999
EVA GALPERIN: If they believe that you have

1641
01:37:22,999 --> 01:37:29,501
a 51 percent chance of being foreign, then you are a legitimate target.

1642
01:37:29,501 --> 01:37:31,999
AUDIENCE: So as a foreigner --    EVA GALPERIN:

1643
01:37:31,999 --> 01:37:34,375
More than 51 percent?

1644
01:37:34,959 --> 01:37:36,751
AUDIENCE: This is really strange

1645
01:37:36,751 --> 01:37:39,626
because there are more than a billion people

1646
01:37:39,626 --> 01:37:42,792
around the world using Facebook.

1647
01:37:43,125 --> 01:37:47,459
The United States has -- I hate to use this word because it's kind

1648
01:37:47,459 --> 01:37:51,709
of inappropriate, but they have kind of declared war on the world

1649
01:37:51,709 --> 01:37:55,083
by having all of this data stored in private companies

1650
01:37:55,083 --> 01:37:59,959
within your borders and yet you have access to all of it.

1651
01:37:59,959 --> 01:38:03,250
So what can we -- well, firstly, as the European government, do

1652
01:38:03,250 --> 01:38:06,834
they have a leg to stand on at all?

1653
01:38:06,918 --> 01:38:09,751
And is there anything we can do to support them?

1654
01:38:09,751 --> 01:38:12,834
EVA GALPERIN: Let me talk about Prism real quick.

1655
01:38:12,918 --> 01:38:18,334
A lot of the time when American NGOs and civil liberties organizations talk

1656
01:38:18,334 --> 01:38:21,334
about Prism, it's very focused on outrage

1657
01:38:21,334 --> 01:38:24,834
over the NSA spying on Americans.

1658
01:38:24,834 --> 01:38:29,083
And the reason why this outrage is so focused is because spying

1659
01:38:29,083 --> 01:38:32,626
on Americans is very clearly outside of what

1660
01:38:32,626 --> 01:38:36,626
the NSA was originally entitled to do.

1661
01:38:36,626 --> 01:38:38,834
It is outside of its purpose.

1662
01:38:38,834 --> 01:38:41,125
And so it is very, very clearly illegal.

1663
01:38:42,083 --> 01:38:45,417
Now, what about the rest of the world?

1664
01:38:45,709 --> 01:38:47,375
A lot of these NGOs will simply leave the rest

1665
01:38:47,375 --> 01:38:49,542
of the world out to dry.

1666
01:38:49,542 --> 01:38:52,999
They'll say the NSA exists to spy on the rest of the world and we can't get

1667
01:38:52,999 --> 01:38:56,751
all upset when it goes around spying on non-U.S.

1668
01:38:56,751 --> 01:38:57,751
persons.

1669
01:38:57,834 --> 01:39:00,250
On this particular point I disagree.

1670
01:39:00,459 --> 01:39:02,999
Just because you are a non-U.S.

1671
01:39:02,999 --> 01:39:05,999
person doesn't mean that you suddenly don't have rights.

1672
01:39:05,999 --> 01:39:10,584
And not just -- it is not like the Bill of Rights and the U.S.

1673
01:39:10,584 --> 01:39:11,834
Constitution and U.S.

1674
01:39:11,834 --> 01:39:14,167
law are the only law on earth.

1675
01:39:14,250 --> 01:39:20,083
And in fact, it seems very likely that the NSA's wiretapping has, or

1676
01:39:20,083 --> 01:39:24,999
the NSA's sort of drag net surveillance does infringe

1677
01:39:24,999 --> 01:39:30,918
on the privacy rights of hundreds of millions of Internet users

1678
01:39:30,918 --> 01:39:33,626
all over the world.

1679
01:39:33,918 --> 01:39:37,459
The problem is that it's very unlikely that we are

1680
01:39:37,459 --> 01:39:42,375
going to get any kind of legal recourse for it.

1681
01:39:42,375 --> 01:39:47,584
There's simply nowhere for us to go to appeal having our basic human

1682
01:39:47,584 --> 01:39:50,959
rights violated as non-U.S.

1683
01:39:50,959 --> 01:39:51,959
persons.

1684
01:39:51,999 --> 01:39:56,584
What we can do is use strong encryption and also there

1685
01:39:56,584 --> 01:40:01,792
has been a great deal of talk within governmental bodies

1686
01:40:01,792 --> 01:40:08,459
all over the world looking into the state of NSA surveillance.

1687
01:40:08,459 --> 01:40:12,167
There was a bill proposed, I think a bill actually made it

1688
01:40:12,167 --> 01:40:16,250
to the floor earlier this week in Mexico.

1689
01:40:16,250 --> 01:40:19,876
There have been a number of proposals in the EU.

1690
01:40:19,876 --> 01:40:21,834
People are really riled up about this.

1691
01:40:21,999 --> 01:40:24,334
It's possible we will see some legislation

1692
01:40:24,334 --> 01:40:27,918
in other parts of the world, especially because one

1693
01:40:27,918 --> 01:40:31,584
of the key parts of the NSA revelations that we've seen

1694
01:40:31,584 --> 01:40:34,876
about NSA spying is that we are not just running

1695
01:40:34,876 --> 01:40:37,501
around spying on non-U.S.

1696
01:40:37,918 --> 01:40:39,999
persons who are a threat to the U.S.

1697
01:40:39,999 --> 01:40:41,709
We are also spying on our allies.

1698
01:40:41,999 --> 01:40:47,999
Needless to say this makes our allies including the five Is, including the U.K.,

1699
01:40:47,999 --> 01:40:50,167
somewhat outraged.

1700
01:40:51,584 --> 01:40:54,375
The question line is back ...

1701
01:40:54,626 --> 01:41:00,209
AUDIENCE: (Speaker away from microphone.)    Sir?

1702
01:41:00,209 --> 01:41:02,083
AUDIENCE: Am I good to go?

1703
01:41:02,375 --> 01:41:03,876
Please.

1704
01:41:03,876 --> 01:41:04,626
We are going to keep some order here

1705
01:41:04,626 --> 01:41:07,083
and sometimes we may return to a follow up question

1706
01:41:07,083 --> 01:41:09,999
but people waiting should get a turn.

1707
01:41:10,083 --> 01:41:12,584
AUDIENCE: In terms of the privacy movement I have

1708
01:41:12,584 --> 01:41:14,751
a two-part question.

1709
01:41:14,999 --> 01:41:19,626
I think in information security we are very aware of all the implications,

1710
01:41:19,626 --> 01:41:24,209
however you say it, of what can happen with all this data.

1711
01:41:24,250 --> 01:41:27,417
But how do you get someone who just goes on Facebook and looks

1712
01:41:27,417 --> 01:41:30,834
at pictures of cats all day to understand what this means

1713
01:41:30,834 --> 01:41:34,792
and what is the next step for the privacy movement?

1714
01:41:34,792 --> 01:41:37,167
Like project mesh net or something.

1715
01:41:37,167 --> 01:41:39,542
What should we be working on in the meantime?

1716
01:41:39,542 --> 01:41:41,959
EVA GALPERIN: All right.

1717
01:41:41,959 --> 01:41:44,999
I guess before we get to the legal aspects of this,

1718
01:41:44,999 --> 01:41:50,999
which Kurt will address shortly, I think that it's a misnomer.

1719
01:41:50,999 --> 01:41:53,834
It is a misunderstanding to say that people these days either

1720
01:41:53,834 --> 01:41:57,459
don't understand the privacy that they are giving up or don't care

1721
01:41:57,459 --> 01:41:59,999
about the privacy that they are giving up when

1722
01:41:59,999 --> 01:42:03,167
they use social networks like Facebook.

1723
01:42:03,167 --> 01:42:06,167
I can say this because I talk to people all over the world

1724
01:42:06,167 --> 01:42:10,792
all the time about their concerns about this very issue.

1725
01:42:11,083 --> 01:42:13,626
If you want to see somebody who has a deep

1726
01:42:13,626 --> 01:42:16,999
and intrinsic understanding of every single one

1727
01:42:16,999 --> 01:42:20,999
of Facebook's privacy protections and how they work, look

1728
01:42:20,999 --> 01:42:26,459
at a teenager whose parents have just friended them on Facebook.

1729
01:42:27,999 --> 01:42:30,876
They know how that stuff works backwards and forwards and

1730
01:42:30,876 --> 01:42:32,542
they keep up with every last update

1731
01:42:32,542 --> 01:42:35,083
because they are very interested in making sure that

1732
01:42:35,083 --> 01:42:37,626
they maintain their privacy from people who, well,

1733
01:42:37,626 --> 01:42:41,959
really shouldn't know what they are doing out on a Saturday night.

1734
01:42:41,999 --> 01:42:46,999
And I think that this is also true for other people who have things

1735
01:42:46,999 --> 01:42:50,626
to lose by losing their privacy.

1736
01:42:50,834 --> 01:42:52,834
People are very aware.

1737
01:42:52,834 --> 01:42:55,083
They are smarter than we give them credit for.

1738
01:42:55,083 --> 01:42:59,334
Really, the task that we have as privacy trainers is just

1739
01:42:59,334 --> 01:43:04,999
to give them the right tools to use in order to protect themselves

1740
01:43:04,999 --> 01:43:10,334
and also to help them understand their threat model.

1741
01:43:10,334 --> 01:43:13,292
Help them understand what information it is that they are trying to protect

1742
01:43:13,292 --> 01:43:16,501
and who they are trying to protect it from.

1743
01:43:16,501 --> 01:43:19,667
If you give users that information they can usually make smart decisions

1744
01:43:19,667 --> 01:43:22,417
about what to do with their privacy.

1745
01:43:22,417 --> 01:43:24,876
I want to add on, how do we make them care,

1746
01:43:24,876 --> 01:43:28,667
considering the NSA thing, spying, right?

1747
01:43:28,667 --> 01:43:31,459
How do we make them care, because in other countries

1748
01:43:31,459 --> 01:43:36,417
they protested, but we didn't put fort an effort as much.

1749
01:43:37,375 --> 01:43:40,999
I'll address this.

1750
01:43:40,999 --> 01:43:43,584
We only have a few minutes remaining in the session.

1751
01:43:43,584 --> 01:43:46,959
Actually, I think we have to cut off the question line.

1752
01:43:47,584 --> 01:43:51,626
One of the things that I think has helped resonate this issue when I talked

1753
01:43:51,626 --> 01:43:54,999
to people about it is talking about privacy in terms of control

1754
01:43:54,999 --> 01:43:56,999
of your information.

1755
01:43:56,999 --> 01:43:59,167
To get away from, whether it's something that you have

1756
01:43:59,167 --> 01:44:01,292
to hide in particular, but don't you want

1757
01:44:01,292 --> 01:44:06,501
to have it so your information only goes to the people that you want it to go to?

1758
01:44:06,501 --> 01:44:08,125
And not to the ones that you don't?

1759
01:44:08,125 --> 01:44:09,999
You have a sense of autonomy and control

1760
01:44:09,999 --> 01:44:14,167
on where your information goes and what the spying is doing

1761
01:44:14,167 --> 01:44:17,999
is taking away that autonomy and giving control away

1762
01:44:17,999 --> 01:44:20,083
to somebody else.

1763
01:44:20,083 --> 01:44:21,626
I found that has been helpful.

1764
01:44:21,626 --> 01:44:22,709
AUDIENCE: I would.

1765
01:44:22,709 --> 01:44:26,250
I would also add that I think people, just to reiterate what Eva said,

1766
01:44:26,250 --> 01:44:30,083
but add on that, at least I don't know how much people

1767
01:44:30,083 --> 01:44:33,667
trust polls, but there has been a slough of polls

1768
01:44:33,667 --> 01:44:38,209
in the past few weeks that have been released that by Pew, Gallup

1769
01:44:38,209 --> 01:44:42,250
and Washington post and others, that shows a clear change

1770
01:44:42,250 --> 01:44:46,667
in people's attitudes, the larger American public's attitudes

1771
01:44:46,667 --> 01:44:51,083
towards privacy and the NSA spying in particular.

1772
01:44:51,083 --> 01:44:54,375
I think the job is to continue to hammer home what we have been

1773
01:44:54,375 --> 01:44:56,751
saying and talking about.

1774
01:44:56,751 --> 01:44:59,292
You know, talking about the lawsuits and what exactly

1775
01:44:59,292 --> 01:45:02,292
is metadata and things like that because at least

1776
01:45:02,292 --> 01:45:06,083
from these recent polls we are seeing -- I think we are seeing

1777
01:45:06,083 --> 01:45:08,709
for the first time since maybe 9/11 where

1778
01:45:08,709 --> 01:45:12,918
the larger public shift towards privacy and shift towards government

1779
01:45:12,918 --> 01:45:15,876
surveillance regime is changing.

1780
01:45:16,209 --> 01:45:20,375
AUDIENCE: There is an active ongoing petition

1781
01:45:20,375 --> 01:45:26,876
on the White House.gov website to pardon Edward Snowden.

1782
01:45:26,876 --> 01:45:29,999
Last time I checked it had 132,000 signatures.

1783
01:45:29,999 --> 01:45:32,501
Is that just an empty gesture?

1784
01:45:32,501 --> 01:45:34,999
Is that a valuable tool?

1785
01:45:35,792 --> 01:45:39,292
Or does that come up with a free Internal Revenue Service

1786
01:45:39,292 --> 01:45:42,167
audit for all the signatories?

1787
01:45:42,167 --> 01:45:47,250
(Laughter.)    AUDIENCE: -- of the petition?

1788
01:45:47,250 --> 01:45:49,999
I wanted to know about what if anything the government has to do

1789
01:45:49,999 --> 01:45:52,459
to respond to that petition.

1790
01:45:52,459 --> 01:45:53,709
I just want to take a chance to talk

1791
01:45:53,709 --> 01:45:56,083
about the White House petitioning system because it

1792
01:45:56,083 --> 01:45:59,999
is something that I don't think a lot of people know about.

1793
01:45:59,999 --> 01:46:01,292
But the we the people site --    KURT OPSAHL: We

1794
01:46:01,292 --> 01:46:03,334
have one minute remaining.

1795
01:46:03,334 --> 01:46:04,999
MARC JAYCOX: The White House petition site

1796
01:46:04,999 --> 01:46:09,501
is a massive campaign tool for the Barack Obama campaign.

1797
01:46:09,501 --> 01:46:12,999
You give them your information and they harvest your data.

1798
01:46:13,417 --> 01:46:15,083
That's my quick ten seconds.

1799
01:46:15,417 --> 01:46:19,667
Be careful when you sign those; it's a campaign tool

1800
01:46:19,667 --> 01:46:23,209
for the president's election.

1801
01:46:25,999 --> 01:46:31,626
KURT OPSAHL: We will talk to you afterwards, but we have to move.

1802
01:46:31,626 --> 01:46:32,918
Sir?

1803
01:46:32,918 --> 01:46:34,876
AUDIENCE: Question and a comment.

1804
01:46:34,876 --> 01:46:38,250
So Congressman Rick Holt of New Jersey has introduced

1805
01:46:38,250 --> 01:46:42,792
legislation to roll back the surveillance state which asks

1806
01:46:42,792 --> 01:46:47,292
for repealing the Patriot Act, refiling FISA Amendments Act,

1807
01:46:47,292 --> 01:46:50,501
not having requirement to have back doors

1808
01:46:50,501 --> 01:46:55,751
in telecommunications equipment and then one more item.

1809
01:46:55,999 --> 01:46:59,292
What do you see as the prospects for that bill?

1810
01:46:59,292 --> 01:47:01,334
MARC JAYCOX: Representative Holt's bill is one

1811
01:47:01,334 --> 01:47:05,375
of the strongest bills presented in Congress thus far.

1812
01:47:05,792 --> 01:47:10,083
The only kind of Nuance with the bill is that it completely --

1813
01:47:10,083 --> 01:47:14,999
the government has some sort of need for a grand jury subpoena

1814
01:47:14,999 --> 01:47:18,459
to get some sort of information.

1815
01:47:18,751 --> 01:47:21,375
Representative Holt's bill doesn't have that in it.

1816
01:47:21,417 --> 01:47:23,959
There should be a process by which that happens, but it's

1817
01:47:23,959 --> 01:47:27,501
the strongest bill thus far and it is another indication that Congress

1818
01:47:27,501 --> 01:47:29,751
will tackle this issue and knock on wood it

1819
01:47:29,751 --> 01:47:33,292
will --    One quick comment because it's relevant.

1820
01:47:33,501 --> 01:47:35,501
He is standing for election in the democratic primary

1821
01:47:35,501 --> 01:47:39,209
on August 15 --    KURT OPSAHL: We are actually out of time.

1822
01:47:39,209 --> 01:47:40,876
But thank you all for coming.

1823
01:47:40,876 --> 01:47:42,918
It's wonderful to see you here.

1824
01:47:42,999 --> 01:47:46,999
(Applause.)    KURT OPSAHL: Thank you.

1825
01:47:46,999 --> 01:47:48,083
It's great to be here.
