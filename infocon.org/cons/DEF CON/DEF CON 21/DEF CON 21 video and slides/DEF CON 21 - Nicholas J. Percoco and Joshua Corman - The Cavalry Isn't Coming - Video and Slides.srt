1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,959
NICHOLAS PERCOCO: Okay, good morning, everybody.

2
00:00:02,999 --> 00:00:03,999
I'm Nick.

3
00:00:03,999 --> 00:00:04,999
This is Josh.

4
00:00:04,999 --> 00:00:06,250
We will do a few introductions and then jump right

5
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:08,000
into the content here.

6
00:00:08,501 --> 00:00:10,250
I'm Nicholas Percoco.

7
00:00:10,334 --> 00:00:14,083
I have always been and I currently am a hacker.

8
00:00:14,083 --> 00:00:15,083
Yay.

9
00:00:15,083 --> 00:00:16,083
(chuckles).

10
00:00:16,083 --> 00:00:18,626
Let's try that again.

11
00:00:18,626 --> 00:00:19,626
No.

12
00:00:19,626 --> 00:00:20,626
Whew.

13
00:00:20,626 --> 00:00:22,792
NICHOLAS PERCOCO: In my day life, day job, I actually run

14
00:00:22,792 --> 00:00:26,999
a small team called Spider Labs at Trustwave.

15
00:00:29,959 --> 00:00:32,999
And some of the background, I have done a lot of speaking.

16
00:00:32,999 --> 00:00:35,250
This is my eighth time speaking here at DEF CON and I spoke

17
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:37,083
on stage at TED.

18
00:00:37,083 --> 00:00:42,584
I have also keynoted RSA this past year and here's Josh.

19
00:00:42,584 --> 00:00:48,167
JOSHUA CORMAN: Good morning.

20
00:00:48,167 --> 00:00:49,999
So I'm Joshua Corman.

21
00:00:49,999 --> 00:00:53,375
In my day job, I'm director of security intelligence for Akamai.

22
00:00:53,375 --> 00:00:55,083
My comments today are my own and may not reflect those

23
00:00:55,083 --> 00:00:56,959
of my employer.

24
00:00:57,999 --> 00:01:01,334
I've kind of been wrestling with being a philosopher

25
00:01:01,334 --> 00:01:04,918
in a hacker community, but I think I've come to own it

26
00:01:04,918 --> 00:01:08,876
and I think my research has trended from things like espionage

27
00:01:08,876 --> 00:01:11,999
and malware to things that have affected our lives

28
00:01:11,999 --> 00:01:15,626
and human rights and public safety and that has taken me

29
00:01:15,626 --> 00:01:18,667
down the path for today's topic.

30
00:01:19,083 --> 00:01:21,417
NICHOLAS PERCOCO: A little bit about where we came

31
00:01:21,417 --> 00:01:23,959
from and where we're going.

32
00:01:24,167 --> 00:01:27,918
This talk is actually not a presentation.

33
00:01:27,918 --> 00:01:28,999
This is a discussion.

34
00:01:28,999 --> 00:01:31,250
This is a discussion between me and Josh here on stage

35
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:33,999
in a discussion with all of you.

36
00:01:34,083 --> 00:01:36,751
This is not a finished presentation.

37
00:01:36,751 --> 00:01:39,501
So if you're expecting at the end of this to have us to solve

38
00:01:39,501 --> 00:01:42,999
the world's problems, that's not the intent.

39
00:01:42,999 --> 00:01:44,501
It is to start the discussion.

40
00:01:46,792 --> 00:01:48,751
In the mid audience we have

41
00:01:48,751 --> 00:01:50,667
a microphone.

42
00:01:50,792 --> 00:01:52,834
It is there for you to use.

43
00:01:52,834 --> 00:01:53,999
If you have a question, you have a comment,

44
00:01:53,999 --> 00:01:57,709
you want something to add to the conversation, please use it.

45
00:01:57,751 --> 00:02:01,999
But also note that we have a finite amount of time here on stage,

46
00:02:01,999 --> 00:02:05,999
45 minutes to be exact, if you can't fit your comments

47
00:02:05,999 --> 00:02:10,959
in 140 characters, please save it for the Q&A session.

48
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:11,999
We will have a Q&A.

49
00:02:11,999 --> 00:02:13,083
There is no Q&A room.

50
00:02:13,083 --> 00:02:14,542
But afterwards please join us in the Chillout lounge

51
00:02:14,542 --> 00:02:16,667
to continue the discussion.

52
00:02:17,334 --> 00:02:20,584
JOSHUA CORMAN: Part of the impetus of this how many

53
00:02:20,584 --> 00:02:23,709
of you have been to DEF CON before?

54
00:02:24,083 --> 00:02:25,083
Okay.

55
00:02:25,083 --> 00:02:28,125
A lot of new people here this year, I don't know if you noticed.

56
00:02:28,125 --> 00:02:30,334
It is both encouraging and overwhelming.

57
00:02:30,334 --> 00:02:32,999
A lot of us got into hacking because it was our hobby.

58
00:02:32,999 --> 00:02:33,751
And when we weren't paying attention how many

59
00:02:33,751 --> 00:02:36,999
of you noticed that it accidentally became our profession?

60
00:02:39,918 --> 00:02:42,667
Again, we weren't paying attention again.

61
00:02:42,667 --> 00:02:43,667
I.T.

62
00:02:43,667 --> 00:02:46,083
security which was our hobby and job ask now permeating every

63
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:50,834
aspect of our personal lives and our personal safety and our kids.

64
00:02:51,626 --> 00:02:53,999
We are putting software in places it does not belong

65
00:02:53,999 --> 00:02:55,792
and it is merited.

66
00:02:56,083 --> 00:02:58,375
We have medical devices that are completely pwnable

67
00:02:58,375 --> 00:03:02,375
and are no encrypted at all on their Bluetooth stacks.

68
00:03:02,375 --> 00:03:06,709
When I tried to buy a car, I couldn't find one that wasn't hackable.

69
00:03:07,999 --> 00:03:12,667
You can find default names for hydroelectric dams.

70
00:03:15,542 --> 00:03:17,334
This isn't fun.

71
00:03:17,334 --> 00:03:18,334
This is real.

72
00:03:18,459 --> 00:03:22,083
As we depend on software in places, it needs to be dependable.

73
00:03:22,083 --> 00:03:25,918
And in the presence of attackers, it needs to be defensible.

74
00:03:27,501 --> 00:03:31,083
Every time I want to quit security, I realize that our failures

75
00:03:31,083 --> 00:03:35,209
will be inherited by me, my mind, my family and soul.

76
00:03:35,999 --> 00:03:37,918
Don't think about how do you get better

77
00:03:37,918 --> 00:03:40,542
at our day job, think about how do you hack your personal

78
00:03:40,542 --> 00:03:42,999
life and your personal freedoms.

79
00:03:42,999 --> 00:03:44,999
And that should be the scope of today.

80
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:48,999
NICHOLAS PERCOCO: A couple of weeks ago I decided to do

81
00:03:48,999 --> 00:03:50,876
a juice cleanse.

82
00:03:50,876 --> 00:03:52,626
Have any of you ever done one before?

83
00:03:53,584 --> 00:03:58,083
You spend three days drinking six bottles of juice and nothing else.

84
00:03:58,125 --> 00:04:02,751
Besides having interesting bowel activity, it also gave me very vivid

85
00:04:02,751 --> 00:04:05,375
dreams when I would sleep.

86
00:04:05,375 --> 00:04:07,709
And so at night I would go to bed and I would wake

87
00:04:07,709 --> 00:04:11,667
up in the morning with these sort of memories, these odd memories.

88
00:04:11,667 --> 00:04:13,584
You know when you wake up from a dream

89
00:04:13,584 --> 00:04:18,167
and you are disoriented and you think it was almost a real experience

90
00:04:18,167 --> 00:04:20,167
within a dream.

91
00:04:20,501 --> 00:04:22,999
I had a few of those a couple of weeks ago.

92
00:04:22,999 --> 00:04:27,209
The first dream I jotted down that I took notes about, I was

93
00:04:27,209 --> 00:04:28,999
on a bus.

94
00:04:29,083 --> 00:04:31,459
The whole dream took place on a bus.

95
00:04:31,459 --> 00:04:33,083
I didn't know where we were going.

96
00:04:33,083 --> 00:04:34,542
I was a little bit confused.

97
00:04:34,542 --> 00:04:35,918
I saw people I recognized.

98
00:04:35,918 --> 00:04:39,209
I saw people sitting with paperwork and computers in front of them.

99
00:04:39,209 --> 00:04:41,167
I started to ask questions.

100
00:04:41,167 --> 00:04:42,167
Where are we?

101
00:04:42,167 --> 00:04:43,167
Where are we going?

102
00:04:43,375 --> 00:04:46,709
And I soon realized that we were all going to apply

103
00:04:46,709 --> 00:04:50,584
for federally issued software development licenses, that each

104
00:04:50,584 --> 00:04:55,709
of us somebody actually showed me they had one that was expired.

105
00:04:55,709 --> 00:04:57,999
They needed to renew their license or they could not even write

106
00:04:57,999 --> 00:04:59,709
a bit of code.

107
00:04:59,751 --> 00:05:03,709
So I thought that was pretty interesting to sort of have that dream.

108
00:05:03,959 --> 00:05:07,918
One of the other dreams I had that I took notes about, I was actually

109
00:05:07,918 --> 00:05:09,459
in a hotel.

110
00:05:09,459 --> 00:05:10,626
I travel quite often.

111
00:05:10,626 --> 00:05:13,459
I actually travel all over the world almost constantly.

112
00:05:13,459 --> 00:05:14,292
And, you know, in the morning when you walk

113
00:05:14,292 --> 00:05:16,334
out of the hotel and the "USA Today" paper is there

114
00:05:16,334 --> 00:05:18,999
on the floor and you see the headlines.

115
00:05:18,999 --> 00:05:20,876
That's how you wake up in the morning.

116
00:05:21,083 --> 00:05:25,999
I glanced down at the paper as I was off to a meeting and saw

117
00:05:25,999 --> 00:05:30,167
on the headlines, it said: Florida man arrested

118
00:05:30,167 --> 00:05:35,375
for hacking tools, possession of hacking tools.

119
00:05:35,375 --> 00:05:37,250
I remember flipping over the paper and reading page 7

120
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:39,918
about what that story was about.

121
00:05:40,999 --> 00:05:45,375
And it showed it had a logo of Metasploit and it mentioned nmap

122
00:05:45,375 --> 00:05:50,501
and Nessus and other tools people have in their possession.

123
00:05:50,501 --> 00:05:52,667
I thought that was interesting.

124
00:05:52,999 --> 00:05:55,334
And then another dream I had I started soon realizing

125
00:05:55,334 --> 00:05:58,083
they weren't necessarily dreams.

126
00:05:58,083 --> 00:05:59,083
They were vivid.

127
00:05:59,083 --> 00:06:01,167
But they were actually nightmares.

128
00:06:01,584 --> 00:06:05,626
In this third dream, I was walking down the street in Chicago.

129
00:06:05,999 --> 00:06:07,125
Sort of dusky.

130
00:06:08,083 --> 00:06:13,542
Turned down an alley and walked up to a door and rang the bell.

131
00:06:13,751 --> 00:06:16,417
I remember trying to see a camera shining on me.

132
00:06:16,417 --> 00:06:18,167
I rang the bell and they buzzed me in.

133
00:06:18,417 --> 00:06:20,792
I went in and walked up three flights of stair and walked

134
00:06:20,792 --> 00:06:22,999
into a Chicago apartment.

135
00:06:23,167 --> 00:06:26,584
And there were girls and boys having conversation.

136
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:31,999
There was a cluster of monitors and in another area there were some

137
00:06:31,999 --> 00:06:36,417
electronics laying about and, of course, a lot of cables all over the floor.

138
00:06:36,417 --> 00:06:39,250
Somebody I recognized actually handed me a beer and said, welcome,

139
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:42,125
the discussion will start in a little while.

140
00:06:42,125 --> 00:06:44,834
I took my seat and started saying hi to people.

141
00:06:44,999 --> 00:06:48,250
And then all of a sudden the lights went out, electricity went out,

142
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:51,626
all the power went out in this apartment.

143
00:06:51,959 --> 00:06:54,167
The initial reaction, I remember someone

144
00:06:54,167 --> 00:06:58,751
in the background saying fucking ComEd, the power went out.

145
00:06:59,167 --> 00:07:02,501
Then we heard banging on the front door and banging

146
00:07:02,501 --> 00:07:06,709
on the back door and men came into the room wearing black shirts,

147
00:07:06,709 --> 00:07:10,167
black pants, black boots and they started to say we were

148
00:07:10,167 --> 00:07:13,792
under arrest for violation of some act.

149
00:07:13,792 --> 00:07:16,083
And I can't really recall what that act was.

150
00:07:16,292 --> 00:07:17,999
They lined up against the wall.

151
00:07:18,083 --> 00:07:22,083
And line by one they zip tied us in our arms and legs and carried us

152
00:07:22,083 --> 00:07:24,083
down the stairs.

153
00:07:25,501 --> 00:07:27,834
Now, this was a nightmare that I had.

154
00:07:27,834 --> 00:07:30,876
Obviously it is not real but it is very much grounded in reality,

155
00:07:30,876 --> 00:07:34,083
in the things that we experience today.

156
00:07:34,083 --> 00:07:37,959
If you extend what is going on today, five, ten years from now,

157
00:07:37,959 --> 00:07:42,876
I can see a time when someplace like DEF CON can't exist.

158
00:07:43,459 --> 00:07:45,459
But we don't have to.

159
00:07:45,999 --> 00:07:47,999
There's a better way.

160
00:07:48,083 --> 00:07:50,999
I could see a time when friends are being arrested

161
00:07:50,999 --> 00:07:53,209
for writing tools.

162
00:07:53,626 --> 00:07:57,501
We're being criminalized for research, but we don't have to.

163
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:02,751
JOSHUA CORMAN:Uh oh.

164
00:08:02,751 --> 00:08:05,250
So when Nick told me his dreams, I had two thoughts.

165
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:07,209
First, I'm never doing a juice cleanse.

166
00:08:07,542 --> 00:08:08,542
(laughter).

167
00:08:08,542 --> 00:08:10,999
JOSHUA CORMAN: I said this isn't fun.

168
00:08:10,999 --> 00:08:12,626
Let's get real.

169
00:08:12,626 --> 00:08:14,167
These are actually precedents.

170
00:08:14,167 --> 00:08:16,999
Whether you love or hate Weev, Weev's case

171
00:08:16,999 --> 00:08:22,999
is very dangerous precedent for the criminalization of research.

172
00:08:22,999 --> 00:08:25,999
This community does and lives and thrives on our ability

173
00:08:25,999 --> 00:08:29,334
to do pervasively do security research.

174
00:08:29,584 --> 00:08:31,501
If you saw the aggressive prosecution

175
00:08:31,501 --> 00:08:35,999
of the late Aaron Schwartz and all the Aaron's law discussions coming

176
00:08:35,999 --> 00:08:37,751
from this.

177
00:08:37,876 --> 00:08:41,083
There is a state law in Texas that makes it technically illegal

178
00:08:41,083 --> 00:08:42,999
to do a port scam.

179
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:48,999
Germany and France have already specifically outlawed certain hacker

180
00:08:48,999 --> 00:08:53,459
tools that are really just assessment and nmapy type things.

181
00:08:53,459 --> 00:08:57,125
I learned last night Brazil, after some actress had some nudy

182
00:08:57,125 --> 00:09:01,083
photo revealed, passed a law that makes it criminalized

183
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:05,584
to have nmap or any port scanning tools at all.

184
00:09:06,167 --> 00:09:08,250
This isn't fun.

185
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:10,751
These are things that are actually happening.

186
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:16,167
And it is up to us in lieu of any adults in the room to be the adults.

187
00:09:16,167 --> 00:09:18,334
Now, that should terrify you, right?

188
00:09:18,334 --> 00:09:19,334
(laughter).

189
00:09:19,334 --> 00:09:21,501
JOSHUA CORMAN: But it dawned on me over the last couple years,

190
00:09:21,501 --> 00:09:25,292
I was researching Anonymous two years ago here at DEF CON.

191
00:09:25,292 --> 00:09:27,459
One of the things I was concerned about was

192
00:09:27,459 --> 00:09:32,125
a neo McCarthyism when you had aggressive, high profile demonstrations

193
00:09:32,125 --> 00:09:34,209
of hacking will.

194
00:09:34,334 --> 00:09:36,999
Whether you like them or not, it captured hearts and minds

195
00:09:36,999 --> 00:09:39,375
and scared policymakers.

196
00:09:39,375 --> 00:09:41,709
When powerful people are uninformed, they make powerfully uninformed

197
00:09:41,709 --> 00:09:43,083
knee jerks.

198
00:09:44,334 --> 00:09:48,083
He started off in his intro: He is now and always was a hacker.

199
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:51,584
I fear the need to say: I'm not now nor have I ever been a hacker

200
00:09:51,584 --> 00:09:53,751
in our near future.

201
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:57,209
If you are not worried about it, you really, really should be

202
00:09:57,209 --> 00:09:59,792
because policymakers are as technically literate

203
00:09:59,792 --> 00:10:01,876
as this community is.

204
00:10:01,999 --> 00:10:04,167
That's really the thrust of this talk, is that I think a lot

205
00:10:04,167 --> 00:10:07,459
of us even our best and brightest researchers, even our A listers, so

206
00:10:07,459 --> 00:10:09,000
to speak, every time I ask them why

207
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,167
they aren't more concerned they are like, someone will come fix it.

208
00:10:13,167 --> 00:10:16,334
Let me tell you something, no one is coming.

209
00:10:16,999 --> 00:10:19,999
The people who are going to fix it are to the left of you, right of you or

210
00:10:19,999 --> 00:10:21,709
in your own chair.

211
00:10:21,834 --> 00:10:23,999
That was really the bit flip for me.

212
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:34,042
So another part of this is, you know, for personal reasons I basically hit rock

213
00:10:34,042 --> 00:10:36,999
bottom in January.

214
00:10:36,999 --> 00:10:38,501
I lost my mom at 58.

215
00:10:38,501 --> 00:10:40,292
Had a pretty tough year last year.

216
00:10:40,292 --> 00:10:42,999
It really throws into context what's important

217
00:10:42,999 --> 00:10:46,459
to you and how much time you have.

218
00:10:46,876 --> 00:10:50,999
And I felt like I was diminished, that I couldn't really contribute.

219
00:10:51,334 --> 00:10:53,792
What I realized is people don't really make changes

220
00:10:53,792 --> 00:10:56,667
until they hit rock bottom, right?

221
00:10:56,667 --> 00:10:58,626
If you want to be a science person no one changes

222
00:10:58,626 --> 00:11:00,999
until the pain of exceeding inertia exceeds

223
00:11:00,999 --> 00:11:03,083
the pain of change.

224
00:11:06,876 --> 00:11:09,292
There is a general malaise here.

225
00:11:09,292 --> 00:11:11,334
Yes, we have had a great week the DEF CON.

226
00:11:11,334 --> 00:11:12,876
There were more talks about burnout and suicide

227
00:11:12,876 --> 00:11:16,334
and depression and there were also a lot of talks that had absolutely

228
00:11:16,334 --> 00:11:20,959
nothing to do with security because there is an implicit defeatism.

229
00:11:20,999 --> 00:11:22,999
And we don't have to accept that defeat.

230
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:26,959
There is actually a value in hitting rock bottom.

231
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:30,999
And that value says when no one has come to save us, it falls to us, right?

232
00:11:30,999 --> 00:11:34,751
And if you don't see good things happening, we can put good things in.

233
00:11:34,876 --> 00:11:39,834
So at my mom's funeral, I said the absence of heat cold

234
00:11:39,834 --> 00:11:42,999
is the absence of heat.

235
00:11:45,083 --> 00:11:47,459
A darkness is the absence of light.

236
00:11:47,501 --> 00:11:49,999
And maybe it is not that there is evil in light but maybe there

237
00:11:49,999 --> 00:11:51,834
is an absence of good.

238
00:11:51,834 --> 00:11:53,250
I realized each one of us can take matters

239
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:58,209
into our own hands and put in that leadership that is sorely lacking.

240
00:11:58,209 --> 00:11:59,876
Nature abhors a vacuum and I can hear

241
00:11:59,876 --> 00:12:03,792
the sucking sound and it is time to fill that vacuum.

242
00:12:05,584 --> 00:12:08,626
Now, what that means is no matter how much we hate certain

243
00:12:08,626 --> 00:12:11,250
things, the alternative is worse.

244
00:12:11,501 --> 00:12:13,250
So we continue to fail.

245
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:15,501
We don't have to fail in the same way, right?

246
00:12:15,501 --> 00:12:17,083
We're actually suggesting some pretty radically

247
00:12:17,083 --> 00:12:19,709
uncomfortable experimentation.

248
00:12:20,083 --> 00:12:22,083
I can't believe we're at DEF CON and we are actually going

249
00:12:22,083 --> 00:12:24,501
to suggest these things, but we haven't really engaged

250
00:12:24,501 --> 00:12:27,959
in the formal process in how things work in the world.

251
00:12:27,959 --> 00:12:30,209
You know, there is no senators or Congressmen who are experts

252
00:12:30,209 --> 00:12:32,292
on stem cell research.

253
00:12:32,417 --> 00:12:36,999
They rely on subject matter experts, think tanks, lobbies, et cetera.

254
00:12:37,083 --> 00:12:39,375
And as much as we hate these ideas we

255
00:12:39,375 --> 00:12:43,626
will ask you to both tolerate and participate in a series

256
00:12:43,626 --> 00:12:47,999
of very uncomfortable and very unnatural acts.

257
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:49,918
And this means we already have EFF.

258
00:12:49,918 --> 00:12:52,751
EFF has done fabulous things for our community.

259
00:12:52,751 --> 00:12:55,375
We haven't really had a voice of interest for our profession and

260
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:57,959
for our talent and expertise.

261
00:12:57,999 --> 00:13:01,250
Now we're actually going to be suggesting and starting we're

262
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:05,250
doing it with or without your help but we would love your help,

263
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:11,083
a 501 (c) (3) think tank for a research, number two, a 501(c)(4) for a lobby.

264
00:13:11,083 --> 00:13:15,584
Even though we think they are horrible corruptly,

265
00:13:15,584 --> 00:13:21,626
we believe it is time to have access to the power.

266
00:13:21,999 --> 00:13:23,999
We are also going to professionalize.

267
00:13:24,083 --> 00:13:26,209
We are going to do it very carefully so we don't

268
00:13:26,209 --> 00:13:28,626
become the monsters we fight.

269
00:13:28,918 --> 00:13:30,999
But just like the Bar association for lawyers or

270
00:13:30,999 --> 00:13:34,834
the American Medical Association giving a voice to the priorities

271
00:13:34,834 --> 00:13:37,999
of this community that is public and can give commentary

272
00:13:37,999 --> 00:13:43,375
on public policy and public events, that's credible, literate voice of reason.

273
00:13:43,876 --> 00:13:46,999
And then possibly, most importantly, we need to integrate a media

274
00:13:46,999 --> 00:13:50,083
and PR campaign to win hearts and minds.

275
00:13:50,083 --> 00:13:52,709
We have some of the best social engineers on earth.

276
00:13:52,709 --> 00:13:55,709
We've done a really, really bad job setting the narrative.

277
00:13:55,709 --> 00:13:59,542
I love seeing Nick on mainstream news or on TED stage.

278
00:13:59,542 --> 00:14:02,501
More often we have seen LeGotte (phonetic).

279
00:14:02,584 --> 00:14:04,250
Once again, we can take that microphone

280
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:06,918
and bully pulpit it and get the right people

281
00:14:06,918 --> 00:14:09,709
with the right messages to actually represent our

282
00:14:09,709 --> 00:14:11,876
community interests.

283
00:14:11,999 --> 00:14:15,709
NICHOLAS PERCOCO: The chain of influence.

284
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:23,083
Whether we like it or not, what we do, what we say, how we dress,

285
00:14:23,083 --> 00:14:28,375
how we what we do in our everyday lives influences people.

286
00:14:28,584 --> 00:14:30,792
Words that are coming out of my mouth right now

287
00:14:30,792 --> 00:14:32,999
on stage may be influencing you in a positive way,

288
00:14:32,999 --> 00:14:35,999
maybe influencing you in a negative way.

289
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:38,375
You may take something that Josh and I have said and talk

290
00:14:38,375 --> 00:14:41,999
to somebody else and that message will relay to them.

291
00:14:42,375 --> 00:14:44,083
But that chain continues.

292
00:14:44,167 --> 00:14:48,459
Now, unfortunately we take someone from our community, someone who

293
00:14:48,459 --> 00:14:51,959
is a hacker from our community, and put them in front

294
00:14:51,959 --> 00:14:55,542
of a policymaker or a senator or a global government this

295
00:14:55,542 --> 00:14:57,709
is not just a U.S.

296
00:14:57,709 --> 00:15:01,209
issue, this is a global issue what they see is not someone they trust

297
00:15:01,209 --> 00:15:05,542
and someone who is an expert but they see a hacker.

298
00:15:05,918 --> 00:15:08,959
And so while the research that that hacker

299
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:14,125
is doing may be vital to our existence, it may have life benefiting needs

300
00:15:14,125 --> 00:15:17,792
behind it, they still see a hacker.

301
00:15:17,999 --> 00:15:20,999
And so what we are doing within this movement is trying

302
00:15:20,999 --> 00:15:23,751
to organize, better organize.

303
00:15:23,751 --> 00:15:27,709
You can have the breakers, you can have the hackers.

304
00:15:27,834 --> 00:15:30,959
They're vitally important to our community.

305
00:15:30,999 --> 00:15:35,459
But then you also need people who go and come up with the fixes.

306
00:15:35,459 --> 00:15:37,667
Now the breakers may be the same people at that come

307
00:15:37,667 --> 00:15:41,083
up with the fixes, but they don't have to be.

308
00:15:41,167 --> 00:15:41,999
So if you're someone out here who likes

309
00:15:41,999 --> 00:15:45,167
to break things how many people like to break things in the room?

310
00:15:45,626 --> 00:15:46,626
Okay.

311
00:15:46,626 --> 00:15:49,709
How many people also like to fix things or like to fix things?

312
00:15:49,959 --> 00:15:51,667
So you are part of this as well.

313
00:15:51,834 --> 00:15:53,959
But it is not just the people in this room.

314
00:15:53,959 --> 00:15:55,250
We also need people to continue that chain

315
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:58,167
and we need people from all different backgrounds,

316
00:15:58,167 --> 00:16:02,083
also people who represent the various industries.

317
00:16:02,334 --> 00:16:04,999
So when we go follow that chain and we put someone in front

318
00:16:04,999 --> 00:16:08,334
of policymakers or we put someone who is on national television

319
00:16:08,334 --> 00:16:11,501
or international news, they may be someone who has one foot

320
00:16:11,501 --> 00:16:15,083
in our community and one foot in the industry that we're focusing on,

321
00:16:15,083 --> 00:16:18,751
where there is the medical community, or the automotive industry or

322
00:16:18,751 --> 00:16:22,334
the transportation networks, whatever that may be.

323
00:16:22,459 --> 00:16:26,999
JOSHUA CORMAN: So we got to think like hackers, right?

324
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:28,999
I want to recognize somebody who has done some outstanding work

325
00:16:28,999 --> 00:16:30,501
in the room.

326
00:16:30,501 --> 00:16:32,083
Jay Radcliffe, can you stand up?

327
00:16:32,083 --> 00:16:38,209
(applause)    JOSHUA CORMAN: So much like the Hair Club for Men, Jay

328
00:16:38,209 --> 00:16:44,125
is not just a researcher but he is also a client.

329
00:16:44,125 --> 00:16:46,918
Jay hacked his insulin pump a couple years back and has

330
00:16:46,918 --> 00:16:51,626
since done some hacking on several different medical devices.

331
00:16:51,999 --> 00:16:56,083
One of the frustrating things, I look at that and I say that research matters.

332
00:16:56,083 --> 00:16:57,542
It really matters.

333
00:16:57,542 --> 00:16:58,792
It affects public good.

334
00:16:58,959 --> 00:16:59,918
He maybe did it because he didn't want

335
00:16:59,918 --> 00:17:02,125
to die or get hacked at an airport.

336
00:17:02,375 --> 00:17:06,999
But a lot of the research we do is fun but does it really matter?

337
00:17:06,999 --> 00:17:09,792
Are we going to find the 700th piece of Android malware, is that going

338
00:17:09,792 --> 00:17:13,417
to differentiate you as a researcher as you try to find fame and glory

339
00:17:13,417 --> 00:17:15,125
or make a name.

340
00:17:15,375 --> 00:17:17,999
When we throw these over the fence, does it work?

341
00:17:18,125 --> 00:17:23,083
I saw the work that Jay and others have done and also the huge loss

342
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:25,209
of Barnaby Jack.

343
00:17:25,209 --> 00:17:28,250
Those two were doing some outstanding Jack.

344
00:17:29,167 --> 00:17:32,375
We were already planning to include Barnaby

345
00:17:32,375 --> 00:17:37,542
in this and that's very, very there's no words for that.

346
00:17:37,918 --> 00:17:40,751
When we look, they really have a hard time.

347
00:17:40,959 --> 00:17:42,999
It is hard we thought about the kill chain.

348
00:17:42,999 --> 00:17:44,375
Everybody know how Lockheed kill chained how to get bad things

349
00:17:44,375 --> 00:17:46,125
out of your network?

350
00:17:46,125 --> 00:17:47,209
We need a kill chain.

351
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:51,626
It was tough for him to get and procure more devices to test.

352
00:17:51,626 --> 00:17:52,876
He did a good job testing and finding the vulnerability,

353
00:17:52,876 --> 00:17:55,501
but the vendor ridiculed, denied, and refused.

354
00:18:01,542 --> 00:18:04,542
We had a hard time affecting that change.

355
00:18:04,751 --> 00:18:06,834
Instead of looking on activities that I found 0day

356
00:18:06,834 --> 00:18:08,292
or I published a pwn or I have

357
00:18:08,292 --> 00:18:11,083
a different presentation at some different conference,

358
00:18:11,083 --> 00:18:14,584
we wanted to see how you pull that to a result.

359
00:18:15,709 --> 00:18:19,459
I went to Kevin Foo and he is an expert in industry.

360
00:18:20,542 --> 00:18:23,999
There is way more medical laws than you can imagine and we are still not

361
00:18:23,999 --> 00:18:25,751
getting there.

362
00:18:25,959 --> 00:18:27,375
F.D.A.

363
00:18:27,375 --> 00:18:28,792
is one of the bottlenecks.

364
00:18:28,792 --> 00:18:31,125
They didn't have the ability to reject devices.

365
00:18:31,125 --> 00:18:32,083
They are not actually putting in framing to allow

366
00:18:32,083 --> 00:18:34,083
for better granularity.

367
00:18:34,501 --> 00:18:36,959
So an individual researcher can have a hard time going

368
00:18:36,959 --> 00:18:39,959
through multiple gates and multiple obstacles.

369
00:18:39,959 --> 00:18:41,999
Really what we want to do is work with people

370
00:18:41,999 --> 00:18:46,709
in industry and map that chain of influence and then fuzz it and try

371
00:18:46,709 --> 00:18:50,083
and iterate a fail fast and focus on we're not done

372
00:18:50,083 --> 00:18:54,792
until we see a substantive change in how we raise the bar and do care

373
00:18:54,792 --> 00:18:59,417
on elective attack surface on life saving technologies.

374
00:18:59,834 --> 00:19:01,999
That's just a deep example of one of these.

375
00:19:01,999 --> 00:19:03,125
These are tractable.

376
00:19:03,125 --> 00:19:04,709
They look overwhelming.

377
00:19:04,709 --> 00:19:06,709
Maybe it is not Jay the one on CNN or maybe he is not

378
00:19:06,709 --> 00:19:09,167
the one that does the driver development to fix it,

379
00:19:09,167 --> 00:19:13,876
but we have the talent in the room for every single step along the way.

380
00:19:15,999 --> 00:19:19,584
NICHOLAS PERCOCO: So there might be some people even when Josh

381
00:19:19,584 --> 00:19:23,999
and I were first talking, thinking, well, this is really hard.

382
00:19:23,999 --> 00:19:26,167
This is going to be very hard.

383
00:19:26,167 --> 00:19:29,083
This is not going to be something that's going to be easy.

384
00:19:29,083 --> 00:19:31,626
But we often do very difficult things, and there's dozens and dozens

385
00:19:31,626 --> 00:19:36,083
of talks here at DEF CON about very, very difficult things that are being done

386
00:19:36,083 --> 00:19:38,334
in a technical world.

387
00:19:38,459 --> 00:19:40,999
So to put it in a little different perspective,

388
00:19:40,999 --> 00:19:43,999
we have we have a clip to show you.

389
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:46,626
If you can dodge a wrench, you can dodge a ball.

390
00:19:49,999 --> 00:19:51,709
What?

391
00:19:54,999 --> 00:19:57,999
(Video playing.)    NICHOLAS PERCOCO: So

392
00:19:57,999 --> 00:20:01,999
if we can hack something, X, fill in something, a iPhone,

393
00:20:01,999 --> 00:20:04,999
a SCADA system, if you can hack anything,

394
00:20:04,999 --> 00:20:07,125
we can hack this.

395
00:20:07,125 --> 00:20:08,999
But we have to be organized.

396
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:10,083
We have to work together.

397
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:13,999
We have to put the right people in the right roles to get this done.

398
00:20:13,999 --> 00:20:15,709
Like we mentioned earlier, you can't put a hacker in front

399
00:20:15,709 --> 00:20:18,000
of a senator because they see a hacker.

400
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,709
We have to put the right people.

401
00:20:21,876 --> 00:20:26,834
Every single one of you has a role to play and can use their best skills,

402
00:20:26,834 --> 00:20:30,999
their best techniques to help drive this home.

403
00:20:31,626 --> 00:20:34,999
Jail breaking the system, it is incredibly difficult to find

404
00:20:34,999 --> 00:20:38,667
a jail break and implement it into weaponize something in order

405
00:20:38,667 --> 00:20:40,999
to perform a jail break.

406
00:20:40,999 --> 00:20:42,501
Very, very complicated.

407
00:20:42,626 --> 00:20:44,083
We can do that with this system.

408
00:20:44,999 --> 00:20:48,459
And as Josh mentioned earlier, some of our best social engineers are

409
00:20:48,459 --> 00:20:51,209
in this room or at this conference.

410
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,709
Some of the best social engineers in the entire world are

411
00:20:53,709 --> 00:20:55,999
in the hacking community.

412
00:20:55,999 --> 00:20:57,542
But it doesn't mean we have to be dishonest and try

413
00:20:57,542 --> 00:21:00,459
to deceive people, but we use those skills.

414
00:21:00,459 --> 00:21:03,167
It is exactly the same skills that the best C.E.O.s on the planet have

415
00:21:03,167 --> 00:21:06,417
for selling their investors on something.

416
00:21:06,667 --> 00:21:11,250
We need those people to step up and actually play that role as well.

417
00:21:11,751 --> 00:21:13,083
So how do we do this?

418
00:21:13,083 --> 00:21:15,292
JOSHUA CORMAN: I really like the fact that we're calling that

419
00:21:15,292 --> 00:21:17,626
everything does have a role.

420
00:21:17,999 --> 00:21:19,125
We really mean it.

421
00:21:19,375 --> 00:21:20,959
When I say on Twitter Jay was giving

422
00:21:20,959 --> 00:21:23,918
a presentation and said one of the biggest bottlenecks

423
00:21:23,918 --> 00:21:25,959
is getting devices.

424
00:21:26,125 --> 00:21:29,125
Three people replied and said I know how to get them.

425
00:21:29,167 --> 00:21:31,584
You have something you can do.

426
00:21:31,626 --> 00:21:34,999
I was talking to a young guy from Portland, Maine, he pointed

427
00:21:34,999 --> 00:21:39,999
out one of his first job was doing device drivers and local SCADA operating

428
00:21:39,999 --> 00:21:41,834
system shop.

429
00:21:42,542 --> 00:21:44,792
You don't even have to be a hacker.

430
00:21:44,792 --> 00:21:46,999
You can just write really, really security aware code for one

431
00:21:46,999 --> 00:21:48,918
of those vendors.

432
00:21:49,167 --> 00:21:54,375
I couldn't find a 0day to find my day but I have been accepted in talking

433
00:21:54,375 --> 00:21:57,959
to government people in cross over.

434
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:02,083
I can take the technical stuff we do here and I can actually make it mainstream

435
00:22:02,083 --> 00:22:05,209
accessible and get in front of policymakers.

436
00:22:05,209 --> 00:22:08,542
There are actually six of us hacker types at an U.N.

437
00:22:08,542 --> 00:22:10,751
meeting in Toronto this spring: Jeff Moss, me,

438
00:22:10,751 --> 00:22:14,250
Nikko Pones (phonetic) and some others.

439
00:22:14,876 --> 00:22:17,876
They were listening to us as the technical voice of reason.

440
00:22:17,876 --> 00:22:19,334
The bad news is we didn't get very organized

441
00:22:19,334 --> 00:22:23,292
but you don't have to be a rock star, A list name to actually contribute

442
00:22:23,292 --> 00:22:27,999
to the research that we're actually carrying to the outside world.

443
00:22:28,125 --> 00:22:30,626
Now, when I say anybody can play a role, I'm also speaking

444
00:22:30,626 --> 00:22:33,999
to those pillars in our industry, our tribal chieftains, because this

445
00:22:33,999 --> 00:22:36,918
is going to be really, really hard.

446
00:22:37,083 --> 00:22:38,999
And in the leadership role, we are going

447
00:22:38,999 --> 00:22:42,709
to need our toughest battles require our strongest lawyers.

448
00:22:42,709 --> 00:22:44,459
So we really, really need not just grassroots

449
00:22:44,459 --> 00:22:47,417
like yeah, yeah, ra, ra, we need leadership roles

450
00:22:47,417 --> 00:22:52,459
like executive directors on some of these different manifestations.

451
00:22:53,459 --> 00:22:56,959
Now, forget the term platform per se.

452
00:22:56,959 --> 00:22:57,959
This is a strawman.

453
00:22:57,959 --> 00:23:00,375
But we think we have put a lot of thought into this.

454
00:23:01,292 --> 00:23:03,834
We be will using this to take it to the meeting

455
00:23:03,834 --> 00:23:06,751
in eight weeks which we will discuss.

456
00:23:06,751 --> 00:23:09,999
We will really see that there are three ways to secure our future.

457
00:23:09,999 --> 00:23:11,999
We have to keep a very small list of priorities so we don't spread

458
00:23:11,999 --> 00:23:13,999
ourselves too thin.

459
00:23:13,999 --> 00:23:15,584
We can learn how to do this on a few topics and then we can

460
00:23:15,584 --> 00:23:16,999
move out.

461
00:23:17,709 --> 00:23:21,792
But essentially I think we need to focus on public good and safety.

462
00:23:21,792 --> 00:23:24,417
And that's really why I wanted to call out Jay and Charlie miller

463
00:23:24,417 --> 00:23:26,250
and Chris Vlasic.

464
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:28,667
Did you see their amazing car hack?

465
00:23:28,999 --> 00:23:32,083
Whether they did it for an altruistic hack, it was amazing.

466
00:23:33,083 --> 00:23:35,918
I got a flood of emails from people who don't know anything

467
00:23:35,918 --> 00:23:38,542
about our industry saying I had absolutely no idea how much

468
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:41,083
of a can be controlled via software.

469
00:23:41,209 --> 00:23:44,501
We have a few people doing research like this.

470
00:23:44,501 --> 00:23:46,709
But I would like to challenge us through this program

471
00:23:46,709 --> 00:23:50,334
to say let's say get a critical mass of rots of you.

472
00:23:50,334 --> 00:23:52,999
If you are going to pick an Android malware, don't.

473
00:23:53,459 --> 00:23:57,083
Pick an auto OS, a medical device, a control system.

474
00:23:57,083 --> 00:24:00,375
Because if we can demonstrate that we are doing a unique public good

475
00:24:00,375 --> 00:24:04,083
for public safety, guess what we can stave off?

476
00:24:05,292 --> 00:24:07,792
We can actually carve off and demonstrate and earn

477
00:24:07,792 --> 00:24:10,584
the permission in the hearts and minds that what we're doing

478
00:24:10,584 --> 00:24:13,751
is critically necessary and, therefore, requires that we can stave

479
00:24:13,751 --> 00:24:15,999
off the criminalization of.

480
00:24:15,999 --> 00:24:19,375
This is your first time speaking at DEF CON?

481
00:24:19,375 --> 00:24:20,709
NICHOLAS PERCOCO: No.

482
00:24:20,834 --> 00:24:24,083
Is this your first time?

483
00:24:24,083 --> 00:24:25,083
JOSHUA CORMAN: No.

484
00:24:25,083 --> 00:24:28,542
NICHOLAS PERCOCO: I don't think we will get away with it anyhow.

485
00:24:28,542 --> 00:24:29,999
(applause)    I was shocked.

486
00:24:29,999 --> 00:24:36,999
I was like, I think he has spoken here before.

487
00:24:36,999 --> 00:24:41,999
JOSHUA CORMAN: We are being controlled by PW crack.

488
00:24:42,417 --> 00:24:45,083
You know, even if you don't care about the public good and love

489
00:24:45,083 --> 00:24:47,999
and safety and want to be a narcissistic vulnerability attempt,

490
00:24:47,999 --> 00:24:51,083
to avoid criminalization this is how we will do it.

491
00:24:51,083 --> 00:24:52,626
If you are going to peck something next year,

492
00:24:52,626 --> 00:24:54,501
pick something that matters.

493
00:24:55,667 --> 00:25:00,459
Whether your mother, father, uncle or aunt, it doesn't matter if you want

494
00:25:00,459 --> 00:25:03,626
to help public good, be selfish.

495
00:25:03,667 --> 00:25:08,083
If we do some things that are clearly valuable that no one else can provide

496
00:25:08,083 --> 00:25:12,250
and we do it in an intelligent way, we get the right PR and air cover

497
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:16,083
for that, we are going to demonstrate that this isn't something

498
00:25:16,083 --> 00:25:17,999
we criminalize.

499
00:25:17,999 --> 00:25:19,667
I don't know if you snow the Obama clip,

500
00:25:19,667 --> 00:25:24,709
he will not scramble jets for a 29 year old attacker, Snowden.

501
00:25:29,209 --> 00:25:32,417
Into my research at the U.N.

502
00:25:32,417 --> 00:25:38,626
and ITU, I'm wear of human rights and civil liberties are not compatible.

503
00:25:38,999 --> 00:25:41,667
We are seeing the battle between the two and civil liberties

504
00:25:41,667 --> 00:25:44,083
and human rights are losing.

505
00:25:44,501 --> 00:25:45,834
They are losing big time.

506
00:25:45,999 --> 00:25:47,999
Part of it is because people are evil.

507
00:25:48,083 --> 00:25:49,999
And part of it people in power.

508
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:52,125
Part of it is they are just illiterate.

509
00:25:52,375 --> 00:25:55,292
I had people in government say we should empower

510
00:25:55,292 --> 00:25:58,209
the carriers to do deep packet inspection

511
00:25:58,209 --> 00:26:02,125
to stave off intellectual property to China by enabling

512
00:26:02,125 --> 00:26:06,999
the deep packet inspection to do signature antivirus.

513
00:26:07,125 --> 00:26:08,999
And I spit out my drink.

514
00:26:08,999 --> 00:26:12,709
I'm like, you do realize the efficacy of signature is zero.

515
00:26:14,999 --> 00:26:17,083
That's really bad math, right?

516
00:26:17,083 --> 00:26:19,083
I can't stop them from question should we trade civil

517
00:26:19,083 --> 00:26:21,083
liberties and fourth amendment for safety

518
00:26:21,083 --> 00:26:24,918
but I can tell them that it won't grant them safety.

519
00:26:24,999 --> 00:26:26,999
So we need to do that for ourselves because we live

520
00:26:26,999 --> 00:26:28,792
in the world, too.

521
00:26:28,918 --> 00:26:31,292
If you really squint, what we are basically describing

522
00:26:31,292 --> 00:26:34,792
will resonate will almost everybody in the room but everybody

523
00:26:34,792 --> 00:26:36,792
in the mainstream.

524
00:26:36,792 --> 00:26:39,167
What we are talking about is protecting our bodies,

525
00:26:39,167 --> 00:26:41,834
our minds and our souls.

526
00:26:42,083 --> 00:26:46,167
NICHOLAS PERCOCO: So there is some next steps.

527
00:26:46,167 --> 00:26:50,792
As we spoke about earlier, we don't have the answer for you.

528
00:26:50,792 --> 00:26:53,292
But we have some next steps that we want to discuss.

529
00:26:53,792 --> 00:26:57,709
So the first of the next steps is naming the movement.

530
00:26:57,792 --> 00:26:59,501
We don't have a name.

531
00:26:59,501 --> 00:27:01,584
We have some stickers up here that have some phrases,

532
00:27:01,584 --> 00:27:04,209
but we haven't named the movement.

533
00:27:04,209 --> 00:27:06,542
If you have ideas, please let us know.

534
00:27:06,918 --> 00:27:08,334
We are very interested.

535
00:27:08,334 --> 00:27:09,334
We are all ears.

536
00:27:09,334 --> 00:27:12,999
There is also forming an executive and advisory board.

537
00:27:13,083 --> 00:27:15,999
This is not going to just be people from the community.

538
00:27:15,999 --> 00:27:17,751
We want to identify those people.

539
00:27:17,751 --> 00:27:19,999
We want to identify those people that have one foot in our industry

540
00:27:19,999 --> 00:27:22,834
and another foot in another because that's where we will get

541
00:27:22,834 --> 00:27:24,667
the most traction.

542
00:27:25,083 --> 00:27:27,334
Also holding the constitutional Congress,

543
00:27:27,334 --> 00:27:29,959
a meeting of anybody who wants to participate,

544
00:27:29,959 --> 00:27:32,667
let's get these things on paper.

545
00:27:32,667 --> 00:27:34,999
Let's brainstorm how we're going to organize.

546
00:27:34,999 --> 00:27:37,584
JOSHUA CORMAN: And this isn't hand waving.

547
00:27:37,999 --> 00:27:39,834
The guys at Derby have given us

548
00:27:39,834 --> 00:27:42,334
a space eight weeks from now.

549
00:27:42,334 --> 00:27:44,792
We will be holding the first hacker constitutional Congress

550
00:27:44,792 --> 00:27:46,334
at DerbyCon.

551
00:27:46,459 --> 00:27:50,334
We will try to figure out how to remote people in.

552
00:27:51,999 --> 00:27:55,417
Coalition of the willing and the chieftains and the folks that want

553
00:27:55,417 --> 00:27:59,083
to make sure we do this intelligently and we have the right platform and

554
00:27:59,083 --> 00:28:02,999
the right issues to promote, we're going to do this right.

555
00:28:03,125 --> 00:28:07,334
NICHOLAS PERCOCO: The other piece is to share the results.

556
00:28:07,334 --> 00:28:10,083
This is not we're not forming a secret society here.

557
00:28:10,250 --> 00:28:12,584
We want to share these results with people.

558
00:28:12,584 --> 00:28:15,083
We want you to have feedback into those results and understand

559
00:28:15,083 --> 00:28:17,626
what's going on at all times.

560
00:28:17,626 --> 00:28:20,083
And so we do have a Twitter account you can follow.

561
00:28:20,083 --> 00:28:21,626
We're working on ways to better communicate and a lot

562
00:28:21,626 --> 00:28:23,999
of that will be figured out at the hacker constitutional

563
00:28:23,999 --> 00:28:26,999
Congress and the protocols we will be using.

564
00:28:26,999 --> 00:28:30,542
Of course, executing projects, building the think tanks, take

565
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:34,542
the medical research and put it in front of the right people that can

566
00:28:34,542 --> 00:28:39,167
change the way change the way they think about what we're doing.

567
00:28:41,501 --> 00:28:44,417
JOSHUA CORMAN: So if we we're not going to teach you

568
00:28:44,417 --> 00:28:46,999
to be experts on all the different international

569
00:28:46,999 --> 00:28:49,834
and domestic legal organizations.

570
00:28:49,834 --> 00:28:52,834
But what we can do and hope to do is just flip that one bit.

571
00:28:52,918 --> 00:28:55,083
If you thought someone was going to come fix this for you, we want you

572
00:28:55,083 --> 00:28:57,876
to realize that the cavalry isn't coming.

573
00:28:57,999 --> 00:28:59,292
It's you.

574
00:29:02,999 --> 00:29:04,999
Now, it's going to be difficult.

575
00:29:05,125 --> 00:29:07,250
It's going to take time.

576
00:29:07,459 --> 00:29:08,999
We're going to have struggles.

577
00:29:08,999 --> 00:29:10,167
We are also are a fairly cynical group so we

578
00:29:10,167 --> 00:29:13,584
will point out all the ways this won't work.

579
00:29:13,751 --> 00:29:17,209
But it's time to start failing fast and iterating.

580
00:29:17,292 --> 00:29:19,501
I'm willing to take the bumps and bruises.

581
00:29:19,501 --> 00:29:22,083
I'm looking at this as a marathon, not a sprint.

582
00:29:22,292 --> 00:29:24,999
And if not, when?

583
00:29:25,334 --> 00:29:26,999
If it is not you, then who?

584
00:29:29,083 --> 00:29:31,083
Yes, we have stickers.

585
00:29:31,083 --> 00:29:32,999
Yes, we have Twitter handles.

586
00:29:32,999 --> 00:29:34,125
What we really need is you.

587
00:29:34,167 --> 00:29:37,999
I have a question and I know you are itching to get to the mic.

588
00:29:37,999 --> 00:29:40,751
But how are you going to make this real and who's in?

589
00:29:43,375 --> 00:29:44,959
Stand up.

590
00:29:44,959 --> 00:29:47,083
NICHOLAS PERCOCO: Stand up if you're in.

591
00:29:48,459 --> 00:29:59,999
(applause)    JOSHUA CORMAN: The adults.

592
00:30:00,334 --> 00:30:04,292
NICHOLAS PERCOCO: The microphone, yes.

593
00:30:04,292 --> 00:30:06,584
Hi there, Gary Reimer.

594
00:30:06,584 --> 00:30:08,459
This is my first DEF CON and I have been coming here

595
00:30:08,459 --> 00:30:12,542
because I want to get full blown into the security world.

596
00:30:12,999 --> 00:30:15,125
And while I'm not an uber geek like a lot

597
00:30:15,125 --> 00:30:20,334
of the people here I can communicate with anybody from a C.E.O.

598
00:30:20,334 --> 00:30:23,959
to a janitor and if I can understand it, I can help them understand it.

599
00:30:23,959 --> 00:30:25,709
And you had me sold five minutes ago which is I why I wanted to be first

600
00:30:25,709 --> 00:30:27,000
on the mic.

601
00:30:27,834 --> 00:30:31,334
I want to get your cards and be a part of this.

602
00:30:31,334 --> 00:30:34,209
I don't know how I can contribute but darn, I want to.

603
00:30:36,417 --> 00:30:42,999
(applause)    NICHOLAS PERCOCO: Yes?

604
00:30:42,999 --> 00:30:45,250
I just want to say the Fourth Amendment is already

605
00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:47,999
the middle ground between the government can do

606
00:30:47,999 --> 00:30:52,292
anything it wants and the government can't do anything at all.

607
00:30:52,709 --> 00:30:56,250
We set rules this he have to follow, a warrant based

608
00:30:56,250 --> 00:30:59,918
on probable cause and witnesses.

609
00:31:01,584 --> 00:31:05,999
That's as far as we should go, period.

610
00:31:05,999 --> 00:31:08,250
The second part of that is more rules and more laws

611
00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:11,999
and more regulations are not going to fix this.

612
00:31:11,999 --> 00:31:15,792
JOSHUA CORMAN: You know, we had I appreciate your comments.

613
00:31:15,792 --> 00:31:17,999
We had some cognitive dissidence about this because we tend

614
00:31:17,999 --> 00:31:20,918
to be a fairly libertarian group.

615
00:31:20,918 --> 00:31:22,918
We tend not to like formal structures.

616
00:31:22,918 --> 00:31:26,250
That's why I hearing aid we need to hold our knows and lead lima beans.

617
00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:31,375
When you are jail breaking a iPhone you don't think

618
00:31:31,375 --> 00:31:35,083
about how it should or shouldn't be, you find a way to get it done.

619
00:31:35,250 --> 00:31:38,959
And I still carry cognitive dissidence over this.

620
00:31:38,959 --> 00:31:41,501
I'm the guy that called out No Child Left Behind act.

621
00:31:41,501 --> 00:31:43,876
The last thing I want to do is push more rules.

622
00:31:46,250 --> 00:31:51,999
But it is using every available mechanism.

623
00:31:51,999 --> 00:31:53,459
We haven't tried these yet.

624
00:31:53,459 --> 00:31:54,918
I am not sure they will work.

625
00:31:54,918 --> 00:31:58,667
I had some very critical people say you need to be transgressive.

626
00:31:58,667 --> 00:32:00,250
You need to break the law.

627
00:32:00,250 --> 00:32:03,626
You have to take Anonymous up ten notches or something like that.

628
00:32:03,626 --> 00:32:05,501
I thought historically about things.

629
00:32:05,876 --> 00:32:07,876
I'm not trying to equate this but Black Panthers were

630
00:32:07,876 --> 00:32:09,542
very aggressive.

631
00:32:09,542 --> 00:32:11,584
They were scaring people.

632
00:32:11,584 --> 00:32:14,083
They weren't causing substantive legal change.

633
00:32:14,626 --> 00:32:16,667
And then you had the civil rights movement which was

634
00:32:16,667 --> 00:32:19,417
more moderate and engaging in system.

635
00:32:19,417 --> 00:32:20,751
And it is unclear if one could have succeeded

636
00:32:20,751 --> 00:32:22,417
about the other.

637
00:32:22,417 --> 00:32:26,083
But I don't want to leave these options on the table.

638
00:32:26,083 --> 00:32:28,999
Even if I get my butt kicked and we're ridiculed and made fun of,

639
00:32:28,999 --> 00:32:32,459
that's okay because we have to try something.

640
00:32:32,542 --> 00:32:35,876
That's why we want to have the hacker constitutional Congress.

641
00:32:38,999 --> 00:32:43,626
I'm hyperconscious of your concern and I share it.

642
00:32:43,999 --> 00:32:47,334
I also want to connect the dots on some things that are happening.

643
00:32:47,334 --> 00:32:48,334
EFF does their part.

644
00:32:48,876 --> 00:32:52,250
There is also FORKDA (phonetic) laws and amicus briefs written for Weev

645
00:32:52,250 --> 00:32:55,542
and there is a whole bunch of law professors.

646
00:32:55,709 --> 00:32:58,999
The thing that broke my heart is none of those little groups were talking

647
00:32:58,999 --> 00:33:00,584
to each other.

648
00:33:00,584 --> 00:33:02,999
So some of the pieces contradicted each other.

649
00:33:02,999 --> 00:33:05,250
Even if it is just aligning and getting critical mass

650
00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:08,667
on the existing initiatives to force multiply them,

651
00:33:08,667 --> 00:33:10,876
that's reasonable.

652
00:33:10,999 --> 00:33:14,125
I think some of us are more angry and more aggressive than others

653
00:33:14,125 --> 00:33:17,542
and I hope that's why we're going to figure out what we can agree

654
00:33:17,542 --> 00:33:20,999
on and make sure that we keep ourselves honest.

655
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:22,459
It is going to take a lot of work.

656
00:33:22,459 --> 00:33:23,792
I do share your concerns.

657
00:33:23,792 --> 00:33:24,792
Thank you.

658
00:33:24,876 --> 00:33:26,501
Hi.

659
00:33:27,999 --> 00:33:30,834
My name is Sara Jeffrey and I actually am really very,

660
00:33:30,834 --> 00:33:34,125
very grateful that you brought up Weev's case.

661
00:33:34,125 --> 00:33:39,083
I do prison support for Weev I mean, Jeremy Hammond, Barrett Brown

662
00:33:39,083 --> 00:33:41,876
and Bradley Manning.

663
00:33:41,876 --> 00:33:46,083
And they have a CFAA charge in their rap sheet.

664
00:33:46,083 --> 00:33:48,375
I was at the defense of Bradley Manning.

665
00:33:48,542 --> 00:33:51,125
For about six hours of the first day they were discussing

666
00:33:51,125 --> 00:33:54,999
the difference between an exe file, an installable file, and shortcut

667
00:33:54,999 --> 00:33:57,417
of a CD on a given drive.

668
00:33:57,417 --> 00:33:59,626
(speaker off microphone.)    What?

669
00:34:01,999 --> 00:34:04,876
More action, less talking.

670
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:05,876
Okay.

671
00:34:05,876 --> 00:34:07,999
This is part of the court marshal, one of the biggest leaps Okay, get

672
00:34:07,999 --> 00:34:09,834
the fuck out.

673
00:34:10,876 --> 00:34:12,584
This is important.

674
00:34:12,584 --> 00:34:13,584
(applause).

675
00:34:13,584 --> 00:34:17,999
The reason I'm not backing down is because every single one

676
00:34:17,999 --> 00:34:24,751
of you here are being persecuted like the actual activists.

677
00:34:24,751 --> 00:34:27,999
And Weev has had 60 days of admin segregation

678
00:34:27,999 --> 00:34:31,083
for tweeting from prison.

679
00:34:31,250 --> 00:34:35,250
Barrett Brown has detoxed opiates without medication.

680
00:34:35,250 --> 00:34:38,999
Jeremy Hammond has been in over 80 days of confinement

681
00:34:38,999 --> 00:34:45,083
for making inmates make anonymous paraphernalia during art projects.

682
00:34:45,375 --> 00:34:49,417
Bradley Manning has been tortured naked 23 hours a day and

683
00:34:49,417 --> 00:34:54,709
they called them a hacker like the way they did with Snowden.

684
00:34:54,959 --> 00:34:58,999
And they are using WGET as a hacker tool.

685
00:34:59,209 --> 00:35:03,375
These are all in the actual court proceedings.

686
00:35:03,375 --> 00:35:06,083
You can read them from the Freedom Press Foundation.

687
00:35:06,083 --> 00:35:11,250
They are coming for all of you, so you guys need to put the egos aside.

688
00:35:11,375 --> 00:35:13,292
That's all I wanted to say.

689
00:35:13,292 --> 00:35:14,292
Thank you.

690
00:35:14,292 --> 00:35:19,999
NICHOLAS PERCOCO: Thank you for your comments.

691
00:35:19,999 --> 00:35:21,626
(applause)    NICHOLAS PERCOCO: That's falls directly in line

692
00:35:21,626 --> 00:35:24,999
with the discussion of the preservation of security research.

693
00:35:24,999 --> 00:35:28,334
As a security researcher, I have done things in the last couple

694
00:35:28,334 --> 00:35:31,125
of years which I may not want to do today just

695
00:35:31,125 --> 00:35:35,626
because of the chance of the broad application of CFAA.

696
00:35:35,792 --> 00:35:37,501
So thank you.

697
00:35:37,999 --> 00:35:39,834
Hi.

698
00:35:39,834 --> 00:35:42,250
You guys have talked a lot about the legislation that you don't

699
00:35:42,250 --> 00:35:45,918
want governments to institute against hackers.

700
00:35:45,918 --> 00:35:48,250
What about any legislation that you might want

701
00:35:48,250 --> 00:35:53,083
to institute that would provide a counteracting effect like, for example,

702
00:35:53,083 --> 00:35:55,626
holding vendors of vulnerable systems

703
00:35:55,626 --> 00:35:57,792
more accountable.

704
00:35:57,792 --> 00:36:00,667
JOSHUA CORMAN: I'm not sure people had that.

705
00:36:00,667 --> 00:36:01,999
I had a little echo there.

706
00:36:02,292 --> 00:36:04,250
Again that cognitive dissidence is ever present

707
00:36:04,250 --> 00:36:08,999
in my mind that I don't necessarily want to add a ton more legislation.

708
00:36:08,999 --> 00:36:09,751
It is more about fixing existing ones

709
00:36:09,751 --> 00:36:11,542
whenever possible.

710
00:36:11,542 --> 00:36:13,209
I think we should use it sparingly.

711
00:36:13,209 --> 00:36:15,999
One of the things we've realized there is a lot of things that divide us back

712
00:36:15,999 --> 00:36:17,999
to the prior comment.

713
00:36:18,083 --> 00:36:19,167
Some people are like, why are you talking

714
00:36:19,167 --> 00:36:21,417
about an amicus brief for Weev.

715
00:36:21,667 --> 00:36:24,209
He's a raging troll asshole or something like that.

716
00:36:24,209 --> 00:36:27,667
I think it doesn't matter if you think he is a raging troll asshole.

717
00:36:27,876 --> 00:36:29,999
It is like People versus Larry Flynn.

718
00:36:29,999 --> 00:36:31,999
You didn't have to like pornography.

719
00:36:31,999 --> 00:36:33,083
It was about free speech.

720
00:36:37,292 --> 00:36:40,667
We have to participate in the working groups that are looking

721
00:36:40,667 --> 00:36:42,250
to rev CFAA.

722
00:36:42,250 --> 00:36:44,999
It is not even for criminalization research.

723
00:36:44,999 --> 00:36:46,334
People are looking at defending themselves

724
00:36:46,334 --> 00:36:49,999
with other things that are also controversial.

725
00:36:50,083 --> 00:36:50,626
One of the things that a lot of people do

726
00:36:50,626 --> 00:36:52,375
is application security research.

727
00:36:52,375 --> 00:36:55,334
They realize there is no liability whatsoever.

728
00:36:55,626 --> 00:36:56,999
So if a toaster burns your house down, you can sue

729
00:36:56,999 --> 00:36:59,083
the people who make the toaster.

730
00:36:59,125 --> 00:37:02,999
If a device gives you too much chemo, you can't sue and win.

731
00:37:06,250 --> 00:37:11,834
We don't want to hurt GDP and competitive edge, but there

732
00:37:11,834 --> 00:37:14,999
is plenty of precedent.

733
00:37:14,999 --> 00:37:16,999
In the medical devices, you have the FDA.

734
00:37:16,999 --> 00:37:19,459
Or in cars, you have the five star crash system.

735
00:37:19,834 --> 00:37:22,667
It is not about shoehorning laws but tweaking them

736
00:37:22,667 --> 00:37:26,417
instead of creating them from whole cloth.

737
00:37:27,083 --> 00:37:28,459
Doug?

738
00:37:29,083 --> 00:37:31,292
Two quick questions.

739
00:37:31,292 --> 00:37:32,334
Pick which you want.

740
00:37:32,501 --> 00:37:36,584
Most of the populations you are talking about trying to channel here tend

741
00:37:36,584 --> 00:37:40,834
to prefer true democracy, one person, one voice, one vote.

742
00:37:41,209 --> 00:37:42,999
What we work in for the most part to do legislation

743
00:37:42,999 --> 00:37:46,876
is representative democracy which is a very different system.

744
00:37:46,876 --> 00:37:49,876
How do you plan to resolve that without alienating people?

745
00:37:49,999 --> 00:37:53,083
The other one is got a lot of people standing up here.

746
00:37:53,083 --> 00:37:54,083
It is awesome.

747
00:37:54,083 --> 00:37:55,083
I love to see that.

748
00:37:55,083 --> 00:37:57,918
Who you do you keep those people enthusiastic at 6 months, 12 months,

749
00:37:57,918 --> 00:37:59,999
18 months, 24 months?

750
00:37:59,999 --> 00:38:02,751
JOSHUA CORMAN: Great points, great questions.

751
00:38:02,918 --> 00:38:04,834
The reason I want to have that constitutional Congress

752
00:38:04,834 --> 00:38:07,167
is so we can decide how to make decisions.

753
00:38:07,167 --> 00:38:08,542
We decide how to decide.

754
00:38:08,542 --> 00:38:10,375
There will be trade offs to all those.

755
00:38:12,584 --> 00:38:15,999
Anything volunteeresque will have its ups and downs.

756
00:38:15,999 --> 00:38:18,209
I think the reason this will have some staying power,

757
00:38:18,209 --> 00:38:20,999
especially if we have early movement and wins

758
00:38:20,999 --> 00:38:24,918
is regardless of your motivation if, you are altruistic, there

759
00:38:24,918 --> 00:38:27,250
is plenty of motivation.

760
00:38:27,334 --> 00:38:30,999
If you are a narcissistic vulnerability pimp I was talking to somebody

761
00:38:30,999 --> 00:38:34,999
and they are like: I don't care, I want to be famous.

762
00:38:35,250 --> 00:38:41,125
How much relationship do you have with CNN or Vanity Fair?

763
00:38:41,125 --> 00:38:45,999
We could be a platform as a service for broadcasting good work.

764
00:38:46,083 --> 00:38:48,792
So there's some built in incentives regardless

765
00:38:48,792 --> 00:38:53,250
of your motivational structure to get some benefit out of this.

766
00:38:53,250 --> 00:38:56,083
And I think because we're so frustrating and because there is no other line

767
00:38:56,083 --> 00:38:58,999
of defense and it falls to us, I'm hoping that that gets

768
00:38:58,999 --> 00:39:01,334
a little bit of movement.

769
00:39:01,334 --> 00:39:03,083
Plus we just need to get an early win.

770
00:39:03,083 --> 00:39:04,751
I think we have a couple in mind.

771
00:39:04,751 --> 00:39:06,375
We have done a lot of prehomework.

772
00:39:06,375 --> 00:39:08,459
Did I answer the second question?

773
00:39:09,792 --> 00:39:15,792
So I just wanted to say while it is easier to subvert existing processes,

774
00:39:15,792 --> 00:39:18,999
we can use the same lobbyist organization

775
00:39:18,999 --> 00:39:23,083
or professional board or whatever to advocate repeal

776
00:39:23,083 --> 00:39:27,083
of existing law that we disagree with.

777
00:39:27,083 --> 00:39:30,709
We don't necessarily have to just roll with whatever's there.

778
00:39:30,709 --> 00:39:32,083
A voice is a voice.

779
00:39:32,083 --> 00:39:36,751
And we can use that to repeal law whole cloth.

780
00:39:36,751 --> 00:39:40,999
So for people who have reservations about that ...

781
00:39:40,999 --> 00:39:42,626
JOSHUA CORMAN: That's true.

782
00:39:42,626 --> 00:39:43,626
Absolutely.

783
00:39:43,626 --> 00:39:45,167
NICHOLAS PERCOCO: Thank you.

784
00:39:45,167 --> 00:39:46,167
(applause).

785
00:39:46,167 --> 00:39:49,083
Again, the choice between two questions.

786
00:39:49,083 --> 00:39:51,375
One is: We know we can save people.

787
00:39:51,667 --> 00:39:54,918
Okay, we can swoop in and rescue the public.

788
00:39:55,083 --> 00:39:57,083
How do we make this more public?

789
00:39:57,083 --> 00:39:59,542
How do we let shoutout that we've done this?

790
00:39:59,959 --> 00:40:03,125
And the second is if you could if you are familiar

791
00:40:03,125 --> 00:40:07,876
with the 501 medical device registration and where that fits

792
00:40:07,876 --> 00:40:10,999
in in the class 2 F.D.A., could you speak

793
00:40:10,999 --> 00:40:16,667
to how we can get software elevated to even a class 3 device?

794
00:40:16,667 --> 00:40:18,542
JOSHUA CORMAN: Okay.

795
00:40:18,542 --> 00:40:20,999
So I'm not the expert on the medical device pump.

796
00:40:20,999 --> 00:40:23,626
But that's why we've sought out people like Kevin.

797
00:40:23,918 --> 00:40:26,959
Kevin does a great job within his scope and remit.

798
00:40:26,999 --> 00:40:29,501
When I talked to him about Bluetooth tiny anecdote

799
00:40:29,501 --> 00:40:32,751
before we run out of too many I said why do you need

800
00:40:32,751 --> 00:40:35,501
Bluetooth on an insulin pump.

801
00:40:36,501 --> 00:40:40,834
He said, it is not like it is a pace maker.

802
00:40:40,834 --> 00:40:42,999
He said it is the bacon principle.

803
00:40:44,709 --> 00:40:48,250
Everything is better with bacon, everything is better with Bluetooth.

804
00:40:48,751 --> 00:40:52,709
One manufacturer did it and then they all had to do it because it was cool.

805
00:40:52,709 --> 00:40:54,792
What you have is something that's not medically

806
00:40:54,792 --> 00:40:59,250
relevant that's highly attackable in a life saving situation.

807
00:40:59,250 --> 00:41:01,417
So we need those subject matter experts to answer the spirit

808
00:41:01,417 --> 00:41:05,375
of your question and that's what we mean by mapping these.

809
00:41:05,375 --> 00:41:07,459
I think the roles and responsibilities we are hoping you can do,

810
00:41:07,459 --> 00:41:10,125
once we map that kill chain for that particular industry,

811
00:41:10,125 --> 00:41:12,584
then we can start iterating.

812
00:41:12,584 --> 00:41:15,250
The pushback I gave him, he said, Josh, the F.D.A.

813
00:41:15,250 --> 00:41:16,999
had a choice between failing to approve

814
00:41:16,999 --> 00:41:22,751
a medically life saving technology or being afraid of a theoretical hack.

815
00:41:22,751 --> 00:41:25,459
And I said, okay, fine, they had to rubber stamp it

816
00:41:25,459 --> 00:41:30,417
but they could have also said by 2015 anyone putting elective remote

817
00:41:30,417 --> 00:41:34,083
technologies on a device could have more validation

818
00:41:34,083 --> 00:41:35,999
and testing.

819
00:41:35,999 --> 00:41:37,792
There is ways to look at this as a marathon even

820
00:41:37,792 --> 00:41:40,999
if they couldn't do it with current things.

821
00:41:40,999 --> 00:41:42,792
I'm not trying to trivialize it.

822
00:41:42,792 --> 00:41:44,501
I know it is far more complicated.

823
00:41:44,918 --> 00:41:48,542
Keeping at it and being the tenacious hacker that fuzzes that

824
00:41:48,542 --> 00:41:50,999
kill chain, we will win.

825
00:41:53,209 --> 00:41:56,167
First of all, I think that a lot of people

826
00:41:56,167 --> 00:42:00,959
like my mother couldn't put together that hacking is related to safety

827
00:42:00,959 --> 00:42:04,999
and it was a matter of teaching her, well, you know, you have

828
00:42:04,999 --> 00:42:07,959
to find these vulnerabilities.

829
00:42:07,959 --> 00:42:10,918
When you find them, then they can be fixed.

830
00:42:10,918 --> 00:42:13,792
And until that point, somebody could exploit them

831
00:42:13,792 --> 00:42:16,709
without you being aware.

832
00:42:16,709 --> 00:42:19,959
So putting the spin on it, being about the safety of our families

833
00:42:19,959 --> 00:42:22,083
is super important.

834
00:42:22,083 --> 00:42:23,417
JOSHUA CORMAN: I agree.

835
00:42:23,417 --> 00:42:27,209
Second of all, how will you prevent an organization

836
00:42:27,209 --> 00:42:31,876
of hackers from being open to abuse?

837
00:42:32,083 --> 00:42:35,999
Because I feel like every time I see hackers organize,

838
00:42:35,999 --> 00:42:39,792
they do things like hoard exploits that it just doesn't

839
00:42:39,792 --> 00:42:41,999
work out so well.

840
00:42:41,999 --> 00:42:44,083
JOSHUA CORMAN: That's a concern that's come up often, is,

841
00:42:44,083 --> 00:42:46,501
you know, one of the things we actually said

842
00:42:46,501 --> 00:42:51,375
in our Anonymous research it was very prone to infiltration and hijacking.

843
00:42:51,375 --> 00:42:54,999
There were several political and government groups infiltrating.

844
00:42:56,083 --> 00:42:59,999
One of the things that's interested about hackers, they are prone

845
00:42:59,999 --> 00:43:03,501
to influence but you can't control them.

846
00:43:03,501 --> 00:43:04,999
We are really hard to control.

847
00:43:04,999 --> 00:43:07,167
It is almost the virtuous being so chaotic.

848
00:43:07,959 --> 00:43:09,999
I think this is going to be hard.

849
00:43:09,999 --> 00:43:11,999
I think keep bringing these criticisms.

850
00:43:11,999 --> 00:43:14,709
This is a good time for probably one more question.

851
00:43:14,709 --> 00:43:17,083
Then we will go to the room.

852
00:43:17,083 --> 00:43:18,459
We want to flag every single one of these because we don't want

853
00:43:18,459 --> 00:43:20,209
to just try something.

854
00:43:20,209 --> 00:43:22,417
We want to actually succeed at something.

855
00:43:22,417 --> 00:43:23,999
So keep raising these concerns.

856
00:43:23,999 --> 00:43:25,584
Oh, look, it is Jay.

857
00:43:25,584 --> 00:43:26,584
Last question.

858
00:43:26,584 --> 00:43:28,709
How fitting is it that it is Jay Radcliffe.

859
00:43:28,709 --> 00:43:33,959
This week I spent all week talking to media about a talk I gave

860
00:43:33,959 --> 00:43:36,999
at Blackhat and BSides.

861
00:43:37,209 --> 00:43:42,083
A software flaw put me closer to death than I would have liked.

862
00:43:42,209 --> 00:43:44,999
And when I approached the vendor about this, they said,

863
00:43:44,999 --> 00:43:47,792
you should have read the manual.

864
00:43:47,999 --> 00:43:50,667
And we're not fixing that.

865
00:43:51,250 --> 00:43:55,542
If you think that, you know, these things are in the future

866
00:43:55,542 --> 00:43:59,083
and that they're coming, they're not.

867
00:43:59,083 --> 00:44:00,334
They're here right now.

868
00:44:00,626 --> 00:44:03,584
And we need to change these things right now.

869
00:44:03,584 --> 00:44:04,999
And I can find a hundred medical device flaws

870
00:44:04,999 --> 00:44:08,459
and I'm still going to get the same response.

871
00:44:08,501 --> 00:44:12,083
It's going to take a mass movement.

872
00:44:12,083 --> 00:44:14,709
It's going to take all of us getting on the same page

873
00:44:14,709 --> 00:44:17,542
to make this problem change.

874
00:44:17,999 --> 00:44:21,667
I can do all these things, but I'm not going to move the rock

875
00:44:21,667 --> 00:44:24,999
an inch forward without more help.

876
00:44:25,083 --> 00:44:27,959
Exactly like Josh is talking about.

877
00:44:27,999 --> 00:44:31,626
In the media, in lobbying groups, in places that we haven't been

878
00:44:31,626 --> 00:44:35,125
before and there is no reason that we can't get together

879
00:44:35,125 --> 00:44:37,584
and move that system.

880
00:44:37,584 --> 00:44:38,584
(applause).

881
00:44:38,584 --> 00:44:40,709
JOSHUA CORMAN: Thank you.

882
00:44:43,375 --> 00:44:46,792
NICHOLAS PERCOCO: So we're out of time

883
00:44:46,792 --> 00:44:51,167
but this conversation doesn't have to stop.

884
00:44:51,250 --> 00:44:54,918
Please join us for Q&A in the Chillout Lounge immediately

885
00:44:54,918 --> 00:44:56,999
after this talk.

886
00:44:56,999 --> 00:44:57,999
Thank you.

887
00:44:57,999 --> 00:45:00,999
We also have stickers up here on stage if you're interested.

888
00:45:00,999 --> 00:45:04,375
(applause)    NICHOLAS PERCOCO: They're on the chairs at the end.
