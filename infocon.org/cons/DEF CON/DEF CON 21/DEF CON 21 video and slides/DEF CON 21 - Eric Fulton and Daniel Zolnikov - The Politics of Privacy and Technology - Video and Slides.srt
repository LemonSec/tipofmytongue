10
00:00:24,125 --> 00:00:25,333
, 00:00:25:07 ,I'm a politician, so I don't expect that

11
00:00:25,334 --> 00:00:28,166
, 00:00:28:03 ,until you figure out what we're trying to do.

12
00:00:28,167 --> 00:00:29,998
, 00:00:29:23

15
00:00:32,501 --> 00:00:38,958
, 00:00:38:22 ,Real quick, why I ran for office is because I don't like how

16
00:00:38,959 --> 00:00:41,500
, 00:00:41:11 ,the game works.

17
00:00:41,501 --> 00:00:45,666
, 00:00:45:15

18
00:00:45,667 --> 00:00:51,998
, 00:00:51:26 ,You'll see what we try to do on behalf of people, not special interest.

19
00:00:51,999 --> 00:00:52,416
, 00:00:52:09

20
00:00:52,417 --> 00:00:54,166
, 00:00:54:03 ,A side note is that I still have a Blackberry,

21
00:00:54,167 --> 00:00:56,917
, 00:00:56:21 ,so hopefully it's the one thing that won't be hacked

22
00:00:56,918 --> 00:00:59,333
, 00:00:59:07 ,during this entire conference.

23
00:00:59,334 --> 00:01:00,124
, 00:01:00:02

34
00:01:20,709 --> 00:01:21,998

, 00:01:26:23 ,   ERIC FULTON: I'm a hacker.

38
00:01:26,999 --> 00:01:28,666
, 00:01:28:15 ,I break things just like you guys.

39
00:01:28,667 --> 00:01:32,124
, 00:01:32:02 ,I run a security consulting firm in Bozeman, Montana.

40
00:01:32,125 --> 00:01:34,750
, 00:01:34:17 ,I know you're thinking what do you hack out there?

41
00:01:34,751 --> 00:01:36,625
, 00:01:36:14

42
00:01:36,626 --> 00:01:39,750
, 00:01:39:17 ,(laughter) It's on the Internet and I can do it in my pajamas.

43
00:01:39,751 --> 00:01:40,041
, 00:01:40:00

44
00:01:40,042 --> 00:01:44,666
, 00:01:44:15 ,It's a lot of fun to be able to ski, adventure, hang out, and go home

45
00:01:44,667 --> 00:01:47,791
, 00:01:47:18 ,and hack hospitals and stuff.

46
00:01:47,792 --> 00:01:48,998
, 00:01:48:25 ,So it's a good time.

47
00:01:48,999 --> 00:01:49,041
, 00:01:49:00

48
00:01:49,042 --> 00:01:50,541
, 00:01:50:12 ,I venture a lot.

49
00:01:50,542 --> 00:01:51,583
, 00:01:51:13 ,I tweet.

50
00:01:51,584 --> 00:01:51,875
, 00:01:51:20

51
00:01:51,876 --> 00:01:55,291
, 00:01:55:06 ,I get to do a little bit of public policy and

52
00:01:55,292 --> 00:01:58,333
, 00:01:58:07 ,a little bit of speaking.

53
00:01:58,334 --> 00:01:59,541
, 00:01:59:12

54
00:01:59,542 --> 00:02:03,583
, 00:02:03:13 ,So we're going to kind of jump right into this.

55
00:02:03,584 --> 00:02:05,082
, 00:02:05:01 ,What do we want to talk about?

56
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:09,249
, 00:02:09:05 ,So Dan and I will talk to you a little bit about information

57
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:12,291
, 00:02:12:06 ,and politics in Montana.

58
00:02:12,292 --> 00:02:16,791
, 00:02:16:18 ,For all of you, you might be go, oh, Montana, just another state.

59
00:02:16,792 --> 00:02:19,541
, 00:02:19:12 ,But Montana is good in that it models and represents what

60
00:02:19,542 --> 00:02:22,666
, 00:02:22:15 ,a lot of other state legislators do.

61
00:02:22,667 --> 00:02:27,500
, 00:02:27:11 ,Maybe on a smaller scale but just as applicable.

62
00:02:27,501 --> 00:02:32,541
, 00:02:32:12

63
00:02:32,542 --> 00:02:35,625
, 00:02:35:14 ,In America we work under the state system and Montana

64
00:02:35,626 --> 00:02:38,999
, 00:02:38:29 ,is very representative of all the states.

65
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,041
, 00:02:41:00 ,Everything we do here can be replicated.

66
00:02:41,042 --> 00:02:45,416
, 00:02:45:09 ,We talk about privacy legislation, what we got to be passed.

67
00:02:45,417 --> 00:02:47,500
, 00:02:47:11 ,We did Daniel was able to get some privacy legislation passed

68
00:02:47,501 --> 00:02:50,208
, 00:02:50:04 ,to make sure your cellphones are safe.

69
00:02:50,209 --> 00:02:51,249
, 00:02:51:05 ,(applause).

70
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:52,999
, 00:02:52:29

71
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,958
, 00:02:58:22 ,But we tried so, so much more and that did not pass.

72
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:01,500
, 00:03:01:11 ,But we realized what we need to do to get privacy legislation passed

73
00:03:01,501 --> 00:03:02,998
, 00:03:02:28 ,in Montana.

74
00:03:02,999 --> 00:03:05,374
, 00:03:05:08 ,So we'll talk about that and our future goals.

75
00:03:05,375 --> 00:03:06,791
, 00:03:06:18 ,   DANIEL ZOLNIKOV: Okay.

76
00:03:06,792 --> 00:03:07,791
, 00:03:07:18 ,So real quick.

77
00:03:07,792 --> 00:03:07,998
, 00:03:07:23 ,I'll talk about Montana and Montana's

78
00:03:07,999 --> 00:03:10,541
, 00:03:10:12 ,legislature, kind of what Eric spoke about prior.

79
00:03:10,542 --> 00:03:10,998
, 00:03:10:23

80
00:03:10,999 --> 00:03:13,998
, 00:03:13:24 ,If we get something passed in Montana, we're not talking

81
00:03:13,999 --> 00:03:18,082
, 00:03:18:01 ,about just what we get in Montana for them, it is shown in the rest

82
00:03:18,083 --> 00:03:22,082
, 00:03:22:01 ,of the states in other states on behalf of you.

83
00:03:22,083 --> 00:03:25,249
, 00:03:25:05 ,I mean, I don't rely on the Feds for making good policy any more.

84
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:25,998
, 00:03:25:23

85
00:03:25,999 --> 00:03:29,166
, 00:03:29:03 ,What we can do in Montana, we can do it anywhere.

86
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:33,541
, 00:03:33:12 ,The size of Montana is comparable to the size of Germany in area.

87
00:03:33,542 --> 00:03:35,998
, 00:03:35:24 ,The population is about a million people.

88
00:03:35,999 --> 00:03:38,208
, 00:03:38:04 ,So we have a lot more cows than people.

89
00:03:38,209 --> 00:03:41,917
, 00:03:41:21 ,The legislature serves 90 days every two years.

90
00:03:41,918 --> 00:03:43,208
, 00:03:43:04 ,If you want to talk about limited government,

91
00:03:43,209 --> 00:03:46,917
, 00:03:46:21 ,four months every two years, that is not too much.

92
00:03:46,918 --> 00:03:48,124
, 00:03:48:02 ,We also have term limits.

93
00:03:48,125 --> 00:03:50,416
, 00:03:50:09 ,I can serve four terms in the House and four terms in the Senate

94
00:03:50,417 --> 00:03:52,416
, 00:03:52:09 ,and then be termed out.

95
00:03:52,417 --> 00:03:52,875
, 00:03:52:20

96
00:03:52,876 --> 00:03:54,541
, 00:03:54:12 ,That is very limited.

97
00:03:54,542 --> 00:03:56,666
, 00:03:56:15 ,There's not a lot of new there's always new politicians

98
00:03:56,667 --> 00:03:58,082
, 00:03:58:01 ,in there.

99
00:03:58,083 --> 00:03:58,583
, 00:03:58:13

100
00:03:58,584 --> 00:04:01,416
, 00:04:01:09 ,The majority of the House and Senate is Republican.

101
00:04:01,417 --> 00:04:02,875
, 00:04:02:20 ,The governor is Democrat.

102
00:04:02,876 --> 00:04:03,541
, 00:04:03:12

103
00:04:03,542 --> 00:04:07,416
, 00:04:07:09 ,I don't really care about the affiliations right now.

104
00:04:07,417 --> 00:04:09,249
, 00:04:09:05 ,It's the fact that you have to work with both sides

105
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:11,833
, 00:04:11:19 ,to get legislation passed.

106
00:04:11,834 --> 00:04:13,625
, 00:04:13:14 ,That's what we'll discuss as well.

107
00:04:13,626 --> 00:04:17,291
, 00:04:17:06

108
00:04:17,292 --> 00:04:20,082
, 00:04:20:01 ,This is a quick screen shot of where Montana is for those

109
00:04:20,083 --> 00:04:22,208
, 00:04:22:04 ,of you who don't know.

110
00:04:22,209 --> 00:04:22,998
, 00:04:22:24

111
00:04:22,999 --> 00:04:24,374
, 00:04:24:08 ,Hey, hey.

112
00:04:24,375 --> 00:04:25,625
, 00:04:25:14

113
00:04:25,626 --> 00:04:27,082
, 00:04:27:01 ,(laughter).

114
00:04:27,083 --> 00:04:29,208
, 00:04:29:04 ,Las Vegas is in the upper left hand corner.

115
00:04:29,209 --> 00:04:29,500
, 00:04:29:11

116
00:04:29,501 --> 00:04:35,291
, 00:04:35:06 ,The side note is we drove from Montana to Las Vegas in 15 hours.

117
00:04:35,292 --> 00:04:37,500
, 00:04:37:11 ,So there is our other accomplishment.

118
00:04:37,501 --> 00:04:38,291
, 00:04:38:06

119
00:04:38,292 --> 00:04:41,249
, 00:04:41:05 ,   ERIC FULTON: We'll prep what we wanted to do and give you

120
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:44,082
, 00:04:44:01 ,a back story for the whole situation.

121
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:44,458
, 00:04:44:10

122
00:04:44,459 --> 00:04:45,583
, 00:04:45:13 ,Right now, how many people know

123
00:04:45,584 --> 00:04:47,458
, 00:04:47:10 ,about Prism, NSA?

124
00:04:47,459 --> 00:04:48,124
, 00:04:48:02

125
00:04:48,125 --> 00:04:50,082
, 00:04:50:01 ,Everybody; right?

126
00:04:50,083 --> 00:04:51,374
, 00:04:51:08 ,It's bad.

127
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:51,625
, 00:04:51:14

128
00:04:51,626 --> 00:04:55,541
, 00:04:55:12 ,And so thank you.

129
00:04:55,542 --> 00:04:56,541
, 00:04:56:12 ,(laughter).

130
00:04:56,542 --> 00:04:58,208
, 00:04:58:04 ,Everything we did was before that.

131
00:04:58,209 --> 00:05:00,208
, 00:05:00:04 ,So think of yourselves six months ago and go,

132
00:05:00,209 --> 00:05:03,374
, 00:05:03:08 ,did I care too much about privacy?

133
00:05:03,375 --> 00:05:07,249
, 00:05:07:05

134
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:09,541
, 00:05:09:12 ,Six months ago a lot of people were just like,

135
00:05:09,542 --> 00:05:11,791
, 00:05:11:18 ,"I trust my government."

136
00:05:11,792 --> 00:05:13,791
, 00:05:13:18

137
00:05:13,792 --> 00:05:14,998
, 00:05:14:23 ,(laughter).

138
00:05:14,999 --> 00:05:15,416
, 00:05:15:09 ,So it was a whole different mind set

139
00:05:15,417 --> 00:05:17,875
, 00:05:17:20 ,before that until now with the recent revelations where

140
00:05:17,876 --> 00:05:19,998
, 00:05:19:27 ,they go maybe I shouldn't.

141
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:24,583
, 00:05:24:13 ,Daniel had his first term as a legislator, a freshman, and it was a feat in itself

142
00:05:24,584 --> 00:05:27,124
, 00:05:27:02 ,for getting the bill passed.

143
00:05:27,125 --> 00:05:27,750
, 00:05:27:17

144
00:05:27,751 --> 00:05:30,458
, 00:05:30:10 ,These things have to learn and navigate

145
00:05:30,459 --> 00:05:33,041
, 00:05:33:00 ,the jungle of politics.

146
00:05:33,042 --> 00:05:38,249
, 00:05:38:05

147
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:42,958
, 00:05:42:22 ,Next time it will be way spectacular, not that we didn't accomplish a lot.

148
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:43,291
, 00:05:43:06

149
00:05:43,292 --> 00:05:45,998
, 00:05:45:26 ,Myself, I worked with Dan doing a little bit of research working

150
00:05:45,999 --> 00:05:49,583
, 00:05:49:13 ,with him bringing the privacy idea kind of to life.

151
00:05:49,584 --> 00:05:49,998
, 00:05:49:24

152
00:05:49,999 --> 00:05:51,791
, 00:05:51:18 ,That's where we're coming from.

153
00:05:51,792 --> 00:05:54,750
, 00:05:54:17 ,So what we want to talk about.

154
00:05:54,751 --> 00:05:56,541
, 00:05:56:12 ,Why is there a need for privacy laws?

155
00:05:56,542 --> 00:06:00,166
, 00:06:00:03 ,Like I said earlier, six months ago, a lot of people didn't necessarily know

156
00:06:00,167 --> 00:06:03,124
, 00:06:03:02 ,where we needed these privacy laws.

157
00:06:03,125 --> 00:06:07,333
, 00:06:07:07 ,We wanted to enforce the constitutional right to privacy.

158
00:06:07,334 --> 00:06:07,625
, 00:06:07:14

159
00:06:07,626 --> 00:06:11,625
, 00:06:11:14 ,Not every state has a constitutional right to privacy.

160
00:06:11,626 --> 00:06:14,208
, 00:06:14:04 ,We're lucky we have, so it's very important.

161
00:06:14,209 --> 00:06:21,875
, 00:06:21:20

162
00:06:21,876 --> 00:06:24,416
, 00:06:24:09 ,Article 10 of the Montana Constitution states

163
00:06:24,417 --> 00:06:28,124
, 00:06:28:02 ,the right of privacy the right of individual privacy is essential

164
00:06:28,125 --> 00:06:31,917
, 00:06:31:21 ,to the well being of a free society and shall not be infringed

165
00:06:31,918 --> 00:06:35,833
, 00:06:35:19 ,without the showing of a compelling state interest.

166
00:06:35,834 --> 00:06:36,082
, 00:06:36:01

167
00:06:36,083 --> 00:06:37,416
, 00:06:37:09 ,Awesome; right?

168
00:06:37,417 --> 00:06:37,791
, 00:06:37:18

169
00:06:37,792 --> 00:06:39,041
, 00:06:39:00 ,(applause).

170
00:06:39,042 --> 00:06:39,333
, 00:06:39:07

171
00:06:39,334 --> 00:06:41,583
, 00:06:41:13 ,This is written by a bunch of guys who didn't even have

172
00:06:41,584 --> 00:06:43,124
, 00:06:43:02 ,technology and they were thinking

173
00:06:43,125 --> 00:06:46,833
, 00:06:46:19 ,about privacy when our constitution was implemented.

174
00:06:46,834 --> 00:06:49,583
, 00:06:49:13 ,It's important, it's essential, and our rights and liberties don't

175
00:06:49,584 --> 00:06:52,791
, 00:06:52:18 ,necessarily have a meaning if we don't have clear laws that

176
00:06:52,792 --> 00:06:54,374
, 00:06:54:08 ,protect them.

177
00:06:54,375 --> 00:06:56,791
, 00:06:56:18 ,We have a constitutional right to privacy.

178
00:06:56,792 --> 00:06:59,416
, 00:06:59:09 ,But if we don't have that enumerated in individual laws, then

179
00:06:59,417 --> 00:07:03,958
, 00:07:03:22 ,the citizens don't have the tools necessary to enforce that.

180
00:07:03,959 --> 00:07:06,998
, 00:07:06:26

181
00:07:06,999 --> 00:07:10,166
, 00:07:10:03 ,The privacy bill that actually got passed, our speech, though,

182
00:07:10,167 --> 00:07:13,998
, 00:07:13:23 ,is not about saying good job, we got a bill passed.

183
00:07:13,999 --> 00:07:15,998
, 00:07:15:25 ,It's the one that failed.

184
00:07:15,999 --> 00:07:17,416
, 00:07:17:09 ,So I'll touch on this first.

185
00:07:17,417 --> 00:07:17,875
, 00:07:17:20

186
00:07:17,876 --> 00:07:20,208
, 00:07:20:04 ,This is cellphone privacy requiring law enforcement to obtain

187
00:07:20,209 --> 00:07:23,999
, 00:07:23:29 ,a search warrant before obtaining from electronic devices.

188
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,998
, 00:07:25:23

189
00:07:25,999 --> 00:07:28,750
, 00:07:28:17 ,This was not considered a big deal at the time

190
00:07:28,751 --> 00:07:32,124
, 00:07:32:02 ,because the NSA event had not occurred.

191
00:07:32,125 --> 00:07:34,917
, 00:07:34:21 ,This is a short and simple bill.

192
00:07:34,918 --> 00:07:36,291
, 00:07:36:06 ,One page long.

193
00:07:36,292 --> 00:07:39,374
, 00:07:39:08 ,It has emergency opt outs, like in case you need to respond

194
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:43,458
, 00:07:43:10 ,to a 911 call or life threatening situation.

195
00:07:43,459 --> 00:07:45,458
, 00:07:45:10 ,So it was a pretty valid bill.

196
00:07:45,459 --> 00:07:46,291
, 00:07:46:06

197
00:07:46,292 --> 00:07:48,541
, 00:07:48:12 ,I worked with both sides.

198
00:07:48,542 --> 00:07:51,625
, 00:07:51:14 ,I listened to both sides, Republicans, and Democrats.

199
00:07:51,626 --> 00:07:53,998
, 00:07:53:24 ,It was a common sense.

200
00:07:53,999 --> 00:07:53,999
, 00:07:53:29

201
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,541
, 00:07:57:12 ,A lot of people said, Isn't that already in law?

202
00:07:57,542 --> 00:08:00,666
, 00:08:00:15 ,No, there is no policy on privacy, especially with cellphones

203
00:08:00,667 --> 00:08:02,750
, 00:08:02:17 ,and things like that.

204
00:08:02,751 --> 00:08:02,998
, 00:08:02:26

205
00:08:02,999 --> 00:08:04,750
, 00:08:04:17 ,This has since been considered

206
00:08:04,751 --> 00:08:06,998
, 00:08:06:28 ,model legislation.

207
00:08:06,999 --> 00:08:11,458
, 00:08:11:10 ,And we originally got the idea from another state that failed to pass it.

208
00:08:11,459 --> 00:08:12,458
, 00:08:12:10 ,We got it passed.

209
00:08:12,459 --> 00:08:13,791
, 00:08:13:18 ,First one in the country.

210
00:08:13,792 --> 00:08:15,333
, 00:08:15:07 ,Now other states are passing it.

211
00:08:15,334 --> 00:08:16,998
, 00:08:16:26 ,That actually makes you feel pretty good in Montana,

212
00:08:16,999 --> 00:08:20,998
, 00:08:20:24 ,who meets once every two years, is in the lead on some of this stuff.

213
00:08:20,999 --> 00:08:21,124
, 00:08:21:02

214
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:22,166
, 00:08:22:03 ,(applause).

215
00:08:22,167 --> 00:08:22,500
, 00:08:22:11

216
00:08:22,501 --> 00:08:23,541
, 00:08:23:12 ,Thank you.

217
00:08:23,542 --> 00:08:24,458
, 00:08:24:10

218
00:08:24,459 --> 00:08:26,998
, 00:08:26:26 ,So here is just a few outlines covering that bill

219
00:08:26,999 --> 00:08:29,249
, 00:08:29:05 ,across the United States.

220
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:33,208
, 00:08:33:04 ,And it's amazing how much press this has received.

221
00:08:33,209 --> 00:08:34,041
, 00:08:34:00 ,I'm really happy.

222
00:08:34,042 --> 00:08:35,166
, 00:08:35:03 ,"

223
00:08:35,167 --> 00:08:39,208
, 00:08:39:04 ,Montana Leads the Way in New Age Privacy Rights," "Warrants

224
00:08:39,209 --> 00:08:45,041
, 00:08:45:00 ,For Cellphone Data," "If You Don't Want the Government to Spy on You,

225
00:08:45,042 --> 00:08:47,625
, 00:08:47:14 ,Move to Montana."

226
00:08:47,626 --> 00:08:48,998
, 00:08:48:23

227
00:08:48,999 --> 00:08:50,999
, 00:08:50:29 ,That one I had no say in that.

228
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,666
, 00:08:53:15 ,   DANIEL ZOLNIKOV: All these headlines, if you check Reddit, some

229
00:08:53,667 --> 00:08:56,041
, 00:08:56:00 ,of these articles were submitted.

230
00:08:56,042 --> 00:09:00,583
, 00:09:00:13 ,One of my favorite comments is, "I don't even know where Montana is;

231
00:09:00,584 --> 00:09:01,998
, 00:09:01:28 ,how are they first?"

232
00:09:01,999 --> 00:09:04,833
, 00:09:04:19 ,And we're still first.

233
00:09:04,834 --> 00:09:06,208
, 00:09:06:04

234
00:09:06,209 --> 00:09:07,708
, 00:09:07:16 ,Excellent.

235
00:09:07,709 --> 00:09:08,998
, 00:09:08:23

236
00:09:08,999 --> 00:09:13,500
, 00:09:13:11 ,The first one is HB 400, the Montana privacy act,

237
00:09:13,501 --> 00:09:19,958
, 00:09:19:22 ,across the world to create a balance act to protect data.

238
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:20,124
, 00:09:20:02

239
00:09:20,125 --> 00:09:21,750
, 00:09:21:17 ,There's a lot of good ideas.

240
00:09:21,751 --> 00:09:24,750
, 00:09:24:17 ,Why not put them together and form something that would protect

241
00:09:24,751 --> 00:09:27,833
, 00:09:27:19 ,the average citizen, constituent?

242
00:09:27,834 --> 00:09:28,249
, 00:09:28:05

243
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:31,374
, 00:09:31:08 ,The real battle over HB 400 is what gives us the insights

244
00:09:31,375 --> 00:09:33,999
, 00:09:33:29 ,into what everybody has to face across the states

245
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,998
, 00:09:36:26 ,with the privacy policy challenge.

246
00:09:36,999 --> 00:09:38,541
, 00:09:38:12

247
00:09:38,542 --> 00:09:41,998
, 00:09:41:27 ,So we'll talk a little bit about the policy frameworks,

248
00:09:41,999 --> 00:09:46,333
, 00:09:46:07 ,because we knew we were embarking on a long journey.

249
00:09:46,334 --> 00:09:50,249
, 00:09:50:05 ,We figured six or twelve months ago that we probably weren't

250
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:54,625
, 00:09:54:14 ,the first ones to think that privacy is important.

251
00:09:54,626 --> 00:09:56,999
, 00:09:56:29

252
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,998
, 00:09:59:26 ,There is a lot of really excellent model laws,

253
00:09:59,999 --> 00:10:02,998
, 00:10:02:27 ,if they were passed or not, on individual states

254
00:10:02,999 --> 00:10:07,958
, 00:10:07:22 ,in foreign countries that are excellent for basing it off of.

255
00:10:07,959 --> 00:10:10,124
, 00:10:10:02 ,First we looked at California Civil Code.

256
00:10:10,125 --> 00:10:10,541
, 00:10:10:12

257
00:10:10,542 --> 00:10:12,958
, 00:10:12:22 ,In it we got a really excellent idea.

258
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:13,998
, 00:10:13:24 ,"

259
00:10:13,999 --> 00:10:17,082
, 00:10:17:01 ,Each agency shall maintain in its records only personal information

260
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:20,458
, 00:10:20:10 ,which is relevant and necessary to accomplish a purpose

261
00:10:20,459 --> 00:10:22,333
, 00:10:22:07 ,of the agency."

262
00:10:22,334 --> 00:10:24,416
, 00:10:24:09 ,This is important because it's basically arguing that

263
00:10:24,417 --> 00:10:27,708
, 00:10:27:16 ,agencies are only allowed to collect information that's pertinent

264
00:10:27,709 --> 00:10:28,999
, 00:10:28:29 ,to them.

265
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:29,208
, 00:10:29:04

266
00:10:29,209 --> 00:10:30,917
, 00:10:30:21 ,And so we liked that idea.

267
00:10:30,918 --> 00:10:32,458
, 00:10:32:10 ,The idea that all these different companies

268
00:10:32,459 --> 00:10:36,500
, 00:10:36:11 ,and agencies shouldn't just have these huge dragnets collecting information

269
00:10:36,501 --> 00:10:38,041
, 00:10:38:00 ,they need.

270
00:10:38,042 --> 00:10:39,458
, 00:10:39:10

271
00:10:39,459 --> 00:10:42,708
, 00:10:42:16 ,Business has to get done, but you don't need

272
00:10:42,709 --> 00:10:45,875
, 00:10:45:20 ,to go much further than that.

273
00:10:45,876 --> 00:10:47,917
, 00:10:47:21 ,Next we went on to Massachusetts laws.

274
00:10:47,918 --> 00:10:50,875
, 00:10:50:20 ,Massachusetts has some excellent privacy legislation.

275
00:10:50,876 --> 00:10:50,999
, 00:10:50:29

276
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,999
, 00:10:53:29 ,Part of the part of it says Section 2, regulations

277
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:59,249
, 00:10:59:05 ,to safeguard personal information of commonwealth residents.

278
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:03,291
, 00:11:03:06 ,This is important because we got the idea that if you collect information,

279
00:11:03,292 --> 00:11:06,750
, 00:11:06:17 ,you should probably be careful with it.

280
00:11:06,751 --> 00:11:09,998
, 00:11:09:28 ,You know, a great example is South Carolina.

281
00:11:09,999 --> 00:11:12,166
, 00:11:12:03 ,How many of you heard of that breach?

282
00:11:12,167 --> 00:11:13,166
, 00:11:13:03 ,Yeah.

283
00:11:13,167 --> 00:11:16,958
, 00:11:16:22 ,South Carolina got owned hard.

284
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:19,374
, 00:11:19:08 ,They lost millions of their residents' and citizens'

285
00:11:19,375 --> 00:11:22,833
, 00:11:22:19 ,information, names, social securities.

286
00:11:22,834 --> 00:11:24,291
, 00:11:24:06 ,I think the whole nine yards.

287
00:11:24,292 --> 00:11:24,998
, 00:11:24:26

288
00:11:24,999 --> 00:11:28,998
, 00:11:28:23 ,If you have that information, you should probably, I don't know,

289
00:11:28,999 --> 00:11:31,666
, 00:11:31:15 ,secure it, if you need it.

290
00:11:31,667 --> 00:11:34,625
, 00:11:34:14 ,This is the argument that for businesses and government that

291
00:11:34,626 --> 00:11:37,998
, 00:11:37:23 ,if they do have this information they shouldn't leave it

292
00:11:37,999 --> 00:11:40,041
, 00:11:40:00 ,on a Windows XP box.

293
00:11:40,042 --> 00:11:45,082
, 00:11:45:01

294
00:11:45,083 --> 00:11:48,249
, 00:11:48:05 ,It's trivial to make sure it's secure.

295
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:50,041
, 00:11:50:00 ,Next we got the known security breach

296
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:52,500
, 00:11:52:11 ,or unauthorized use.

297
00:11:52,501 --> 00:11:52,917
, 00:11:52:21

298
00:11:52,918 --> 00:11:55,999
, 00:11:55:29 ,This basically gives us the idea that, okay, now we have companies,

299
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,333
, 00:11:58:07 ,hopefully, collecting only the information

300
00:11:58,334 --> 00:12:01,416
, 00:12:01:09 ,they need and actually protecting that information and

301
00:12:01,417 --> 00:12:04,833
, 00:12:04:19 ,if protecting that information they should know when they're

302
00:12:04,834 --> 00:12:09,124
, 00:12:09:02 ,breached, which means that citizens should be alerted to that.

303
00:12:09,125 --> 00:12:10,374
, 00:12:10:08 ,If your information is stolen and you tonight know it,

304
00:12:10,375 --> 00:12:12,374
, 00:12:12:08 ,you can't react to it.

305
00:12:12,375 --> 00:12:18,082
, 00:12:18:01 ,You can't just cover it up and say oh, that never happened, because it did.

306
00:12:18,083 --> 00:12:21,999
, 00:12:21:29 ,It impacts people and it is necessary for them to let them know that.

307
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:22,708
, 00:12:22:16

308
00:12:22,709 --> 00:12:25,082
, 00:12:25:01 ,Next we wanted privacy laws.

309
00:12:25,083 --> 00:12:27,875
, 00:12:27:20 ,A little side note about me.

310
00:12:27,876 --> 00:12:29,875
, 00:12:29:20 ,All my grandparents are immigrants.

311
00:12:29,876 --> 00:12:30,998
, 00:12:30:23

312
00:12:30,999 --> 00:12:36,291
, 00:12:36:06 ,Half are from Italy, from my dad's side, his parents are from Russia.

313
00:12:36,292 --> 00:12:38,999
, 00:12:38:29 ,They had to move away from Russia when they took

314
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,750
, 00:12:42:17 ,out the czars, and all that good stuff.

315
00:12:42,751 --> 00:12:45,998
, 00:12:45:24

316
00:12:45,999 --> 00:12:51,998
, 00:12:51:23 ,Let's look at other historical past issues that have happened.

317
00:12:51,999 --> 00:12:53,999
, 00:12:53:29 ,What's happened in other countries?

318
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,082
, 00:12:55:01 ,Why is it bad?

319
00:12:55,083 --> 00:12:56,333
, 00:12:56:07 ,How can we learn from it?

320
00:12:56,334 --> 00:12:58,625
, 00:12:58:14 ,I think it's really good, especially if I'm setting policy to be able

321
00:12:58,626 --> 00:13:01,998
, 00:13:01:28 ,to have a little insight into history to make sure we do not repeat our

322
00:13:01,999 --> 00:13:04,998
, 00:13:04:24 ,mistakes or other countries' mistakes.

323
00:13:04,999 --> 00:13:06,625
, 00:13:06:14

324
00:13:06,626 --> 00:13:09,875
, 00:13:09:20 ,Germany's data privacy laws, basically they have

325
00:13:09,876 --> 00:13:13,249
, 00:13:13:05 ,a few things that we looked and liked.

326
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:15,998
, 00:13:15:26 ,And I think most of the reason why these were created

327
00:13:15,999 --> 00:13:19,291
, 00:13:19:06 ,is because Natazi, the secret police were watching

328
00:13:19,292 --> 00:13:21,998
, 00:13:21:25 ,over east Germans, they were collecting

329
00:13:21,999 --> 00:13:26,291
, 00:13:26:06 ,all the information about them, the secret police.

330
00:13:26,292 --> 00:13:26,833
, 00:13:26:19

331
00:13:26,834 --> 00:13:29,249
, 00:13:29:05 ,From what I understand, these laws are put in place

332
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:32,958
, 00:13:32:22 ,to protect the German citizens, and that includes preventing

333
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:35,249
, 00:13:35:05 ,organizations from collecting any personal

334
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:39,291
, 00:13:39:06 ,and personally identifiable information without obtaining permission

335
00:13:39,292 --> 00:13:41,458
, 00:13:41:10 ,from an individual.

336
00:13:41,459 --> 00:13:43,708
, 00:13:43:16 ,And that includes name, birthdate, phone number, IP address,

337
00:13:43,709 --> 00:13:46,249
, 00:13:46:05 ,personal address, things like that.

338
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:48,291
, 00:13:48:06 ,Then there needs to be permission for the collection

339
00:13:48,292 --> 00:13:51,917
, 00:13:51:21 ,of data which must be specific, including how, where, how long, and

340
00:13:51,918 --> 00:13:54,998
, 00:13:54:23 ,for what purposes the data will be used.

341
00:13:54,999 --> 00:13:58,541
, 00:13:58:12 ,And then individuals may revoke permissions at any time, and policy,

342
00:13:58,542 --> 00:14:02,166
, 00:14:02:03 ,procedures, and controls must be put in place to ensure that

343
00:14:02,167 --> 00:14:06,208
, 00:14:06:04 ,all the organizations' data is being collected.

344
00:14:06,209 --> 00:14:09,082
, 00:14:09:01 ,This is a major point.

345
00:14:09,083 --> 00:14:11,917
, 00:14:11:21 ,This is the consent to have information collected.

346
00:14:11,918 --> 00:14:13,208
, 00:14:13:04 ,We'll hit that over and over.

347
00:14:13,209 --> 00:14:16,998
, 00:14:16:27 ,It's one of the most important points of our entire piece of legislation.

348
00:14:16,999 --> 00:14:18,998
, 00:14:18:23

349
00:14:18,999 --> 00:14:20,208
, 00:14:20:04 ,Okay.

350
00:14:20,209 --> 00:14:21,958
, 00:14:21:22 ,So the creation process.

351
00:14:21,959 --> 00:14:22,291
, 00:14:22:06

352
00:14:22,292 --> 00:14:23,958
, 00:14:23:22 ,You go on.

353
00:14:23,959 --> 00:14:24,958
, 00:14:24:22 ,Research.

354
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:26,998
, 00:14:26:26 ,   ERIC FULTON: I'll talk about research.

355
00:14:26,999 --> 00:14:28,416
, 00:14:28:09 ,Thanks, Comrade Zolnikov.

356
00:14:28,417 --> 00:14:28,998
, 00:14:28:23

357
00:14:28,999 --> 00:14:31,625
, 00:14:31:14 ,A lot of research went into this.

358
00:14:31,626 --> 00:14:32,791
, 00:14:32:18 ,A lot.

359
00:14:32,792 --> 00:14:37,374
, 00:14:37:08 ,Because we were able to say, hey, we took a look at what everyone else

360
00:14:37,375 --> 00:14:40,666
, 00:14:40:15 ,is doing, how it impacted those other countries,

361
00:14:40,667 --> 00:14:44,416
, 00:14:44:09 ,and we can say, "Look, Germany can do it, why can't we?"

362
00:14:44,417 --> 00:14:49,541
, 00:14:49:12 ,Business lobbyists, everyone, kept going, "That's impossible.

363
00:14:49,542 --> 00:14:51,041
, 00:14:51:00 ,That's never going to happen."

364
00:14:51,042 --> 00:14:51,291
, 00:14:51:06

365
00:14:51,292 --> 00:14:53,374
, 00:14:53:08 ,And it's nice when you have a clear case that goes, "Yes,

366
00:14:53,375 --> 00:14:55,500
, 00:14:55:11 ,it's already been done."

367
00:14:55,501 --> 00:14:55,875
, 00:14:55:20

368
00:14:55,876 --> 00:14:57,249
, 00:14:57:05 ,So we did research in the way everyone else is doing

369
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:59,166
, 00:14:59:03 ,and what we wanted to do.

370
00:14:59,167 --> 00:15:01,291
, 00:15:01:06 ,We'll talk a little bit more about that when we go in depth

371
00:15:01,292 --> 00:15:02,917
, 00:15:02:21 ,on HB 400.

372
00:15:02,918 --> 00:15:03,458
, 00:15:03:10

373
00:15:03,459 --> 00:15:05,416
, 00:15:05:09 ,We researched the bills.

374
00:15:05,417 --> 00:15:07,750
, 00:15:07:17 ,We drafted this lengthy human readable document, something you

375
00:15:07,751 --> 00:15:10,416
, 00:15:10:09 ,and I could understand, and then I kind of tossed it

376
00:15:10,417 --> 00:15:13,998
, 00:15:13:23 ,over the fence to Daniel and let him handle it.

377
00:15:13,999 --> 00:15:16,416
, 00:15:16:09 ,   DANIEL ZOLNIKOV: The best thing about a state with low population,

378
00:15:16,417 --> 00:15:18,917
, 00:15:18:21 ,I went to college with Eric.

379
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:20,625
, 00:15:20:14 ,That's how I know him.

380
00:15:20,626 --> 00:15:24,124
, 00:15:24:02

381
00:15:24,125 --> 00:15:26,082
, 00:15:26:01 ,I'm the representative.

382
00:15:26,083 --> 00:15:29,333
, 00:15:29:07 ,He calls me and I call legislative services with the draft he wrote

383
00:15:29,334 --> 00:15:31,416
, 00:15:31:09 ,and put together.

384
00:15:31,417 --> 00:15:34,249
, 00:15:34:05 ,I sent it to them, who put it in a bill form.

385
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:35,998
, 00:15:35:24 ,That is your true form of representative government

386
00:15:35,999 --> 00:15:37,666
, 00:15:37:15 ,in my opinion.

387
00:15:37,667 --> 00:15:37,998
, 00:15:37:25

388
00:15:37,999 --> 00:15:40,958
, 00:15:40:22 ,So we did that's exactly what happened.

389
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:42,666
, 00:15:42:15

390
00:15:42,667 --> 00:15:47,082
, 00:15:47:01 ,The legislative representatives put it in a form that could become law.

391
00:15:47,083 --> 00:15:49,541
, 00:15:49:12

392
00:15:49,542 --> 00:15:52,416
, 00:15:52:09 ,It's a basic form of language.

393
00:15:52,417 --> 00:15:55,541
, 00:15:55:12 ,   ERIC FULTON: It's the foreign language called legalese.

394
00:15:55,542 --> 00:15:58,041
, 00:15:58:00

395
00:15:58,042 --> 00:16:02,998
, 00:16:02:27 ,We sent it back and it went back and forth until we said it's pretty good.

396
00:16:02,999 --> 00:16:08,998
, 00:16:08:26 ,Then it all came together in HB 400.

397
00:16:08,999 --> 00:16:10,374
, 00:16:10:08 ,This is the big bill.

398
00:16:10,375 --> 00:16:12,998
, 00:16:12:26 ,This is the meat and potatoes of our presentation.

399
00:16:12,999 --> 00:16:16,082
, 00:16:16:01 ,This is lining out in what we want to see in Montana,

400
00:16:16,083 --> 00:16:19,082
, 00:16:19:01 ,but the United States.

401
00:16:19,083 --> 00:16:20,708
, 00:16:20:16 ,We'll talk about the main points of the bill, and then some

402
00:16:20,709 --> 00:16:23,583
, 00:16:23:13 ,of the issues we had of getting it passed.

403
00:16:23,584 --> 00:16:23,875
, 00:16:23:20

404
00:16:23,876 --> 00:16:26,998
, 00:16:26:28 ,Call me na ve, I thought I'll put all these great ideas together

405
00:16:26,999 --> 00:16:29,998
, 00:16:29:26 ,and they'll get passed by government.

406
00:16:29,999 --> 00:16:30,291
, 00:16:30:06

407
00:16:30,292 --> 00:16:32,998
, 00:16:32:25 ,Turns out it's a little bit more involved than that.

408
00:16:32,999 --> 00:16:36,082
, 00:16:36:01 ,So we'll talk about that, some of the issues and go from there.

409
00:16:36,083 --> 00:16:36,416
, 00:16:36:09

410
00:16:36,417 --> 00:16:39,625
, 00:16:39:14 ,So to talk about the main points, a lot of these, you know, it's going

411
00:16:39,626 --> 00:16:42,166
, 00:16:42:03 ,to feel like what you heard before because I talked

412
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:46,166
, 00:16:46:03 ,about other types of legislation that we had pulled from.

413
00:16:46,167 --> 00:16:48,208
, 00:16:48:04 ,So pulling one HB 400 is that data subjects must be given

414
00:16:48,209 --> 00:16:52,249
, 00:16:52:05 ,notice when their personal information is being collected.

415
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:52,833
, 00:16:52:19

416
00:16:52,834 --> 00:16:54,541
, 00:16:54:12 ,Pretty easy; right?

417
00:16:54,542 --> 00:16:54,998
, 00:16:54:25

418
00:16:54,999 --> 00:16:57,666
, 00:16:57:15 ,It seems like it would be fairly easy to do.

419
00:16:57,667 --> 00:16:58,583
, 00:16:58:13

420
00:16:58,584 --> 00:17:01,666
, 00:17:01:15 ,If you were giving your information up and a company was going

421
00:17:01,667 --> 00:17:04,541
, 00:17:04:12 ,to be using it, they have to tell you.

422
00:17:04,542 --> 00:17:05,958
, 00:17:05:22

423
00:17:05,959 --> 00:17:10,833
, 00:17:10:19 ,A lot of people don't realize when they get that information or when

424
00:17:10,834 --> 00:17:14,416
, 00:17:14:09 ,they go to Safeway and use the card that gives them

425
00:17:14,417 --> 00:17:17,416
, 00:17:17:09 ,a Â¢0.05 discount, there's something going

426
00:17:17,417 --> 00:17:22,583
, 00:17:22:13 ,on and people are taking that information and selling it.

427
00:17:22,584 --> 00:17:24,500
, 00:17:24:11

428
00:17:24,501 --> 00:17:28,708
, 00:17:28:16 ,Next personal information may be used only for the purpose stated and not

429
00:17:28,709 --> 00:17:30,998
, 00:17:30:24 ,for any other purpose.

430
00:17:30,999 --> 00:17:32,625
, 00:17:32:14 ,This kind of ties in with the California law, which

431
00:17:32,626 --> 00:17:35,291
, 00:17:35:06 ,is stating they should only have the information necessary

432
00:17:35,292 --> 00:17:36,999
, 00:17:36:29 ,to do their job.

433
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,998
, 00:17:38:25 ,So you know, there's no reason for your bank

434
00:17:38,999 --> 00:17:44,041
, 00:17:44:00 ,to be selling your information and using it in a healthcare manner.

435
00:17:44,042 --> 00:17:44,249
, 00:17:44:05

436
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:47,082
, 00:17:47:01 ,They need to be separate and distinct.

437
00:17:47,083 --> 00:17:47,458
, 00:17:47:10

438
00:17:47,459 --> 00:17:48,998
, 00:17:48:26 ,Personal information may not be disclosed

439
00:17:48,999 --> 00:17:51,958
, 00:17:51:22 ,without the data subject's consent.

440
00:17:51,959 --> 00:17:54,998
, 00:17:54:23 ,As it stands, your information is being rampantly bought

441
00:17:54,999 --> 00:17:58,041
, 00:17:58:00 ,and sold without you even knowing.

442
00:17:58,042 --> 00:17:58,998
, 00:17:58:24

443
00:17:58,999 --> 00:18:00,958
, 00:18:00:22 ,That is a problem.

444
00:18:00,959 --> 00:18:02,998
, 00:18:02:23 ,You need to have ownership of your data.

445
00:18:02,999 --> 00:18:05,791
, 00:18:05:18 ,You need to know where it's going, why it's being sold.

446
00:18:05,792 --> 00:18:06,875
, 00:18:06:20

447
00:18:06,876 --> 00:18:09,291
, 00:18:09:06 ,Points four through seven, personal information that

448
00:18:09,292 --> 00:18:13,208
, 00:18:13:04 ,is collected must be kept secure from any potential abuses.

449
00:18:13,209 --> 00:18:13,500
, 00:18:13:11

450
00:18:13,501 --> 00:18:14,833
, 00:18:14:19 ,We talked about this.

451
00:18:14,834 --> 00:18:17,208
, 00:18:17:04 ,If you're gonna have data, you should protect it.

452
00:18:17,209 --> 00:18:18,998
, 00:18:18:24 ,Next, data subjects must be informed as to who is collecting

453
00:18:18,999 --> 00:18:20,998
, 00:18:20:27 ,the personal information.

454
00:18:20,999 --> 00:18:21,124
, 00:18:21:02

455
00:18:21,125 --> 00:18:24,708
, 00:18:24:16 ,You've got to understand who is collecting your information so that

456
00:18:24,709 --> 00:18:29,998
, 00:18:29:24 ,if they do have it, you can say I'd like to delete that or update that.

457
00:18:29,999 --> 00:18:30,541
, 00:18:30:12

458
00:18:30,542 --> 00:18:33,833
, 00:18:33:19 ,Subjects must be allowed access to make corrections

459
00:18:33,834 --> 00:18:36,249
, 00:18:36:05 ,on any inaccurate data.

460
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:37,458
, 00:18:37:10

461
00:18:37,459 --> 00:18:40,291
, 00:18:40:06 ,Kind of the ones we slid in at the end because the idea

462
00:18:40,292 --> 00:18:43,625
, 00:18:43:14 ,is your information's being traded all around and it is needed

463
00:18:43,626 --> 00:18:47,124
, 00:18:47:02 ,for legitimate business in certain circumstances.

464
00:18:47,125 --> 00:18:48,708
, 00:18:48:16 ,And so because it's your data, you should have the opportunity

465
00:18:48,709 --> 00:18:49,999
, 00:18:49:29 ,to update it.

466
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,374
, 00:18:52:08 ,One of the great examples is credit reports.

467
00:18:52,375 --> 00:18:54,374
, 00:18:54:08 ,Right now it's kind of a black box on where they get the information

468
00:18:54,375 --> 00:18:56,917
, 00:18:56:21 ,and who knows if it's accurate.

469
00:18:56,918 --> 00:19:00,708
, 00:19:00:16 ,You should be able to review it and go, no, that's not me and that's when

470
00:19:00,709 --> 00:19:02,791
, 00:19:02:18 ,someone to fix it.

471
00:19:02,792 --> 00:19:06,416
, 00:19:06:09

472
00:19:06,417 --> 00:19:09,998
, 00:19:09:25 ,The data collector's accountable for following the principles

473
00:19:09,999 --> 00:19:11,998
, 00:19:11:23 ,in this section.

474
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:12,082
, 00:19:12:01

475
00:19:12,083 --> 00:19:14,666
, 00:19:14:15 ,This is one of the most poignant clauses.

476
00:19:14,667 --> 00:19:20,750
, 00:19:20:17

477
00:19:20,751 --> 00:19:23,958
, 00:19:23:22 ,It's rampant discard for the privacy.

478
00:19:23,959 --> 00:19:28,998
, 00:19:28:28 ,There is action they can seek in civil suits.

479
00:19:28,999 --> 00:19:30,998
, 00:19:30:25

480
00:19:30,999 --> 00:19:34,541
, 00:19:34:12 ,By having it in a law, it allows them to do so much more.

481
00:19:34,542 --> 00:19:34,958
, 00:19:34:22

482
00:19:34,959 --> 00:19:37,625
, 00:19:37:14 ,That was HB 400 in a box.

483
00:19:37,626 --> 00:19:37,917
, 00:19:37:21

484
00:19:37,918 --> 00:19:41,291
, 00:19:41:06 ,So we'll now talk a bit about we had this great idea.

485
00:19:41,292 --> 00:19:43,998
, 00:19:43:27 ,We built this giant framework for privacy.

486
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:44,416
, 00:19:44:09

487
00:19:44,417 --> 00:19:45,999
, 00:19:45:29 ,What are some issues we have?

488
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,625
, 00:19:48:14 ,One of the biggest one was definitions.

489
00:19:48,626 --> 00:19:51,291
, 00:19:51:06 ,Then we had opt outs and extenuating circumstances.

490
00:19:51,292 --> 00:19:51,875
, 00:19:51:20

491
00:19:51,876 --> 00:19:55,416
, 00:19:55:09 ,One of the biggest was definition issues.

492
00:19:55,417 --> 00:19:55,708
, 00:19:55:16

493
00:19:55,709 --> 00:19:59,291
, 00:19:59:06 ,When we wrote this, when you get into a project and you start using

494
00:19:59,292 --> 00:20:02,625
, 00:20:02:14 ,the terminology, especially in technology, you kind of start

495
00:20:02,626 --> 00:20:04,998
, 00:20:04:23 ,to use the inside terms.

496
00:20:04,999 --> 00:20:07,500
, 00:20:07:11 ,But to someone on the outside, it doesn't necessarily make

497
00:20:07,501 --> 00:20:09,374
, 00:20:09:08 ,the same sense.

498
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:11,625
, 00:20:11:14 ,And so to counteract this we try to have all these definitions,

499
00:20:11,626 --> 00:20:14,958
, 00:20:14:22 ,like agency, blocking, business, collection.

500
00:20:14,959 --> 00:20:14,999
, 00:20:14:29

501
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,998
, 00:20:19:25 ,A lot of legislators read it and their eyes glazed over.

502
00:20:19,999 --> 00:20:20,500
, 00:20:20:11

503
00:20:20,501 --> 00:20:22,708
, 00:20:22:16 ,Data subject can be hard to differentiate

504
00:20:22,709 --> 00:20:25,249
, 00:20:25:05 ,from customer and individual.

505
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:27,998
, 00:20:27:25 ,We realized we really needed to tone down the language of the bill

506
00:20:27,999 --> 00:20:30,583
, 00:20:30:13 ,for Montana, at least, for it to be understandable law

507
00:20:30,584 --> 00:20:33,208
, 00:20:33:04 ,representative of the citizens alike.

508
00:20:33,209 --> 00:20:37,999
, 00:20:37:29 ,   DANIEL ZOLNIKOV: I'll go back to the politics side of it

509
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,041
, 00:20:41:00 ,from what I stand for.

510
00:20:41,042 --> 00:20:43,291
, 00:20:43:06 ,I am a conservative Republican.

511
00:20:43,292 --> 00:20:45,541
, 00:20:45:12 ,Republicans have the House and the Senate.

512
00:20:45,542 --> 00:20:49,875
, 00:20:49:20 ,This bill had to keep that in mind, because Republican conservatives,

513
00:20:49,876 --> 00:20:55,124
, 00:20:55:02 ,they listen a lot so they don't over regulate industries.

514
00:20:55,125 --> 00:20:58,998
, 00:20:58:24

515
00:20:58,999 --> 00:21:03,082
, 00:21:03:01 ,There is overreaching clauses and this is the biggest one that we had

516
00:21:03,083 --> 00:21:06,291
, 00:21:06:06 ,in that bill which was probably a little bit too far,

517
00:21:06,292 --> 00:21:10,583
, 00:21:10:13 ,which I actually think it's too far myself now that I've really read it

518
00:21:10,584 --> 00:21:12,750
, 00:21:12:17 ,and focused on it.

519
00:21:12,751 --> 00:21:14,666
, 00:21:14:15 ,I'll read it as quick as I can.

520
00:21:14,667 --> 00:21:15,750
, 00:21:15:17 ,"

521
00:21:15,751 --> 00:21:17,124
, 00:21:17:02 ,A business may not refrain from conducting commerce

522
00:21:17,125 --> 00:21:19,998
, 00:21:19:24 ,with an individual solely because the individual refuses

523
00:21:19,999 --> 00:21:22,791
, 00:21:22:18 ,to consent to the business's collection, processing or use

524
00:21:22,792 --> 00:21:25,208
, 00:21:25:04 ,to the individual's personal information except when

525
00:21:25,209 --> 00:21:28,166
, 00:21:28:03 ,the personal information is genuinely needed for the business

526
00:21:28,167 --> 00:21:30,291
, 00:21:30:06 ,to provide the service or product requested

527
00:21:30,292 --> 00:21:34,291
, 00:21:34:06 ,to complete a financial transaction or to comply with the law."

528
00:21:34,292 --> 00:21:36,750
, 00:21:36:17 ,Basically this says if you want to get a cellphone plan

529
00:21:36,751 --> 00:21:39,833
, 00:21:39:19 ,with a cellphone company and they say, hey, we are going

530
00:21:39,834 --> 00:21:42,999
, 00:21:42:29 ,to collect your information, you say no.

531
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,625
, 00:21:45:14 ,You're not and you don't give consent.

532
00:21:45,626 --> 00:21:48,082
, 00:21:48:01 ,Well, this would say that the cellphone company still has

533
00:21:48,083 --> 00:21:51,541
, 00:21:51:12 ,to give you a cellphone plan since their business isn't focused

534
00:21:51,542 --> 00:21:54,958
, 00:21:54:22 ,on since their business isn't focused on that information that

535
00:21:54,959 --> 00:21:56,998
, 00:21:56:23 ,they're collecting.

536
00:21:56,999 --> 00:21:56,999
, 00:21:56:29

537
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,124
, 00:21:59:02 ,And that he is wrong, because if you don't want to work

538
00:21:59,125 --> 00:22:02,833
, 00:22:02:19 ,with them or don't want to consent, I don't believe the business still has

539
00:22:02,834 --> 00:22:04,958
, 00:22:04:22 ,to offer everything up.

540
00:22:04,959 --> 00:22:07,998
, 00:22:07:24 ,You are now informed they're collecting your information.

541
00:22:07,999 --> 00:22:08,166
, 00:22:08:03 ,You'll go to the competitor that says you're not

542
00:22:08,167 --> 00:22:11,998
, 00:22:11:25 ,collecting the information, you'll start buying those services.

543
00:22:11,999 --> 00:22:12,458
, 00:22:12:10

544
00:22:12,459 --> 00:22:15,750
, 00:22:15:17 ,There were a few overreaching clauses like this.

545
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:15,998
, 00:22:15:26

546
00:22:15,999 --> 00:22:18,998
, 00:22:18:27 ,Another one was the small business burden.

547
00:22:18,999 --> 00:22:20,541
, 00:22:20:12 ,Can small businesses comply?

548
00:22:20,542 --> 00:22:22,124
, 00:22:22:02 ,Say we have a local mom and pop shop that collects

549
00:22:22,125 --> 00:22:26,998
, 00:22:26:26 ,your information, your address, your credit card information, whatever.

550
00:22:26,999 --> 00:22:29,082
, 00:22:29:01 ,There's some things they're collecting.

551
00:22:29,083 --> 00:22:32,958
, 00:22:32:22 ,Well, do they have the ability to have it all secure?

552
00:22:32,959 --> 00:22:34,998
, 00:22:34:26 ,Are they putting it in a secure location?

553
00:22:34,999 --> 00:22:36,791
, 00:22:36:18 ,Are they keeping it on the desktop?

554
00:22:36,792 --> 00:22:38,750
, 00:22:38:17 ,Is it used on Excel spreadsheet which could

555
00:22:38,751 --> 00:22:40,666
, 00:22:40:15 ,easily be lost?

556
00:22:40,667 --> 00:22:40,875
, 00:22:40:20

557
00:22:40,876 --> 00:22:44,999
, 00:22:44:29 ,I'm not going to say, yeah, this is really important or not important.

558
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,999
, 00:22:46:29 ,That I stand for I'm too concerned either end of it,

559
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,041
, 00:22:50:00 ,because this was really a philosophical conversation that we

560
00:22:50,042 --> 00:22:52,416
, 00:22:52:09 ,were having in the House.

561
00:22:52,417 --> 00:22:54,333
, 00:22:54:07 ,Does it hurt smaller business?

562
00:22:54,334 --> 00:22:55,917
, 00:22:55:21 ,Well, the question is should they be getting information

563
00:22:55,918 --> 00:22:58,998
, 00:22:58:23 ,and collecting it if they cannot keep it secure?

564
00:22:58,999 --> 00:23:02,458
, 00:23:02:10 ,One of the many issues and points that were brought up.

565
00:23:02,459 --> 00:23:04,917
, 00:23:04:21

566
00:23:04,918 --> 00:23:06,124
, 00:23:06:02 ,Okay.

567
00:23:06,125 --> 00:23:07,124
, 00:23:07:02 ,So now we'll talk from the political side

568
00:23:07,125 --> 00:23:10,124
, 00:23:10:02 ,the people issues that I had to deal with.

569
00:23:10,125 --> 00:23:13,458
, 00:23:13:10 ,This includes leadership issues, the extensive push back from lobbyists,

570
00:23:13,459 --> 00:23:16,583
, 00:23:16:13 ,my favorite part, the fact it was considered too long

571
00:23:16,584 --> 00:23:19,833
, 00:23:19:19 ,at 26 pages, and that the representatives didn't really

572
00:23:19,834 --> 00:23:22,124
, 00:23:22:02 ,understand it or read it.

573
00:23:22,125 --> 00:23:24,998
, 00:23:24:23 ,   ERIC FULTON: It's not all doom and gloom, though.

574
00:23:24,999 --> 00:23:26,291
, 00:23:26:06

575
00:23:26,292 --> 00:23:31,291
, 00:23:31:06 ,   DANIEL ZOLNIKOV: This is the bill.

576
00:23:31,292 --> 00:23:34,124
, 00:23:34:02 ,We have the first page of it anyway.

577
00:23:34,125 --> 00:23:35,998
, 00:23:35:24 ,We have two days to get signatures.

578
00:23:35,999 --> 00:23:38,583
, 00:23:38:13 ,I received 37 signatures from the House and the Senate

579
00:23:38,584 --> 00:23:42,583
, 00:23:42:13 ,out of 150 individuals, the senators and representatives in Montana,

580
00:23:42,584 --> 00:23:45,833
, 00:23:45:19 ,I got 37 signatures, about a fourth who were supportive

581
00:23:45,834 --> 00:23:47,166
, 00:23:47:03 ,of this.

582
00:23:47,167 --> 00:23:48,998
, 00:23:48:25 ,This is on both sides of the aisle.

583
00:23:48,999 --> 00:23:49,166
, 00:23:49:03

584
00:23:49,167 --> 00:23:53,998
, 00:23:53:24 ,I was trying to speak to the members of the Appropriations Committee so it

585
00:23:53,999 --> 00:23:56,625
, 00:23:56:14 ,could be heard in that committee so it had

586
00:23:56,626 --> 00:23:59,458
, 00:23:59:10 ,a better chance of surviving.

587
00:23:59,459 --> 00:24:00,998
, 00:24:00:26

588
00:24:00,999 --> 00:24:03,998
, 00:24:03:28 ,I knew the committee would have to go to get it passed

589
00:24:03,999 --> 00:24:07,833
, 00:24:07:19 ,beyond so it could then get heard on the House floor and then sent

590
00:24:07,834 --> 00:24:10,833
, 00:24:10:19 ,to the Senate and hopefully signed.

591
00:24:10,834 --> 00:24:13,958
, 00:24:13:22 ,This was a really good achievement, believe it or not.

592
00:24:13,959 --> 00:24:16,124
, 00:24:16:02 ,The cosponsors may not support all the legislation,

593
00:24:16,125 --> 00:24:18,998
, 00:24:18:23 ,but they support the idea.

594
00:24:18,999 --> 00:24:20,208
, 00:24:20:04

595
00:24:20,209 --> 00:24:21,998
, 00:24:21:26 ,Both sides of the aisle.

596
00:24:21,999 --> 00:24:23,958
, 00:24:23:22 ,Some people would not be in the same room together unless

597
00:24:23,959 --> 00:24:26,998
, 00:24:26:24 ,they're forced to had their names on this bill.

598
00:24:26,999 --> 00:24:28,082
, 00:24:28:01

599
00:24:28,083 --> 00:24:29,333
, 00:24:29:07 ,Okay.

600
00:24:29,334 --> 00:24:30,374
, 00:24:30:08 ,Leadership issues.

601
00:24:30,375 --> 00:24:31,998
, 00:24:31:25 ,Conservative leadership.

602
00:24:31,999 --> 00:24:33,708
, 00:24:33:16 ,I'm in the House.

603
00:24:33,709 --> 00:24:34,999
, 00:24:34:29 ,I'm a House representative.

604
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:39,416
, 00:24:39:09 ,So I was begging that this bill of mine, this really important bill that no one

605
00:24:39,417 --> 00:24:43,416
, 00:24:43:09 ,else really cared about at that point, because they were worried

606
00:24:43,417 --> 00:24:49,041
, 00:24:49:00 ,about their making Montana more job friendly or doing something with taxes.

607
00:24:49,042 --> 00:24:55,998
, 00:24:55:25 ,We had a $300 million surplus; the focus was on different issues.

608
00:24:55,999 --> 00:24:59,958
, 00:24:59:22 ,Mine was down here on the priority list of importance.

609
00:24:59,959 --> 00:25:04,958
, 00:25:04:22 ,So they promised that my bill would end up in the Judiciary Committee.

610
00:25:04,959 --> 00:25:07,833
, 00:25:07:19 ,The Judiciary Committee is where we talk about gun bills,

611
00:25:07,834 --> 00:25:11,541
, 00:25:11:12 ,gay rights, abortion bills, sex slavery.

612
00:25:11,542 --> 00:25:13,875
, 00:25:13:20 ,The press was always in there.

613
00:25:13,876 --> 00:25:16,333
, 00:25:16:07 ,This is the committee where they battle it out.

614
00:25:16,334 --> 00:25:19,833
, 00:25:19:19 ,And you can bet that this committee is very stacked on the Republican

615
00:25:19,834 --> 00:25:21,708
, 00:25:21:16 ,and Democrat side.

616
00:25:21,709 --> 00:25:23,998
, 00:25:23:25 ,It's the people more worried about liberties and rights than

617
00:25:23,999 --> 00:25:27,541
, 00:25:27:12 ,they are about lobbyists telling them what to do.

618
00:25:27,542 --> 00:25:27,791
, 00:25:27:18

619
00:25:27,792 --> 00:25:34,833
, 00:25:34:19 ,Since privacy is a big issue, perfect committee for the bills.

620
00:25:34,834 --> 00:25:36,291
, 00:25:36:06 ,A lot of people don't want their bills to go in there

621
00:25:36,292 --> 00:25:38,998
, 00:25:38:25 ,because that's where their bills die.

622
00:25:38,999 --> 00:25:41,291
, 00:25:41:06 ,I was begging to have it in there.

623
00:25:41,292 --> 00:25:43,998
, 00:25:43:24 ,Please put my bill in appropriations.

624
00:25:43,999 --> 00:25:44,458
, 00:25:44:10

625
00:25:44,459 --> 00:25:46,249
, 00:25:46:05 ,In the end, leadership was not concerned

626
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:49,374
, 00:25:49:08 ,about it and my bill was causing some issues.

627
00:25:49,375 --> 00:25:49,791
, 00:25:49:18

628
00:25:49,792 --> 00:25:52,998
, 00:25:52:23 ,There was a lot of big business, special interest,

629
00:25:52,999 --> 00:25:56,708
, 00:25:56:16 ,that were pushing against it from the start.

630
00:25:56,709 --> 00:25:59,416
, 00:25:59:09 ,And so the bill ended up being put in the Business and Labor Committee

631
00:25:59,417 --> 00:26:01,124
, 00:26:01:02 ,to be killed.

632
00:26:01,125 --> 00:26:06,082
, 00:26:06:01

633
00:26:06,083 --> 00:26:08,998
, 00:26:08:27 ,So we'll talk about the lobbyist side of things.

634
00:26:08,999 --> 00:26:12,833
, 00:26:12:19 ,I do not really like lobbyists or a lost special interest.

635
00:26:12,834 --> 00:26:17,998
, 00:26:17:26

636
00:26:17,999 --> 00:26:19,082
, 00:26:19:01 ,(applause).

637
00:26:19,083 --> 00:26:22,082
, 00:26:22:01 ,   ERIC FULTON: They're like the same class as meter maids.

638
00:26:22,083 --> 00:26:24,625
, 00:26:24:14 ,   DANIEL ZOLNIKOV: Exactly.

639
00:26:24,626 --> 00:26:29,166
, 00:26:29:03 ,From a side note, politicians think they're really smart,

640
00:26:29,167 --> 00:26:34,124
, 00:26:34:02 ,and they can get more money to then serve again, and why

641
00:26:34,125 --> 00:26:38,082
, 00:26:38:01 ,the hell are you in politics is my question,

642
00:26:38,083 --> 00:26:42,998
, 00:26:42:25 ,if that's really what you're standing for?

643
00:26:42,999 --> 00:26:46,998
, 00:26:46:26 ,Well, I had some issues with them, because some of the representatives

644
00:26:46,999 --> 00:26:51,708
, 00:26:51:16 ,in Business and Labor Committee, especially service to their sponsors,

645
00:26:51,709 --> 00:26:53,625
, 00:26:53:14 ,aka lobbyists.

646
00:26:53,626 --> 00:26:54,998
, 00:26:54:24 ,This isn't my issue.

647
00:26:54,999 --> 00:26:56,291
, 00:26:56:06

648
00:26:56,292 --> 00:26:57,958
, 00:26:57:22 ,I'll do what you want along the lines

649
00:26:57,959 --> 00:26:59,998
, 00:26:59:24 ,with all these other ones.

650
00:26:59,999 --> 00:27:05,750
, 00:27:05:17 ,They hear a bill is bad, they're like oh, three bill points, bad, I'll kill it.

651
00:27:05,751 --> 00:27:08,998
, 00:27:08:25 ,Well, this was painted from a lot of the bigger lobby groups

652
00:27:08,999 --> 00:27:12,958
, 00:27:12:22 ,as more regulation and growing government.

653
00:27:12,959 --> 00:27:15,291
, 00:27:15:06 ,It was a bad bill.

654
00:27:15,292 --> 00:27:18,500
, 00:27:18:11 ,As a conservative Republican, they were painting me as rhino,

655
00:27:18,501 --> 00:27:21,998
, 00:27:21:27 ,a sellout, we need to get rid of this.

656
00:27:21,999 --> 00:27:26,416
, 00:27:26:09

657
00:27:26,417 --> 00:27:29,998
, 00:27:29:23 ,In reality they were concerned about using the ability to profit

658
00:27:29,999 --> 00:27:32,374
, 00:27:32:08 ,from consumer information.

659
00:27:32,375 --> 00:27:34,999
, 00:27:34:29 ,They make a lot of money from it.

660
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,708
, 00:27:36:16 ,There's really no standards.

661
00:27:36,709 --> 00:27:36,998
, 00:27:36:23

662
00:27:36,999 --> 00:27:39,998
, 00:27:39:24 ,So they don't want standards put on it yet.

663
00:27:39,999 --> 00:27:43,249
, 00:27:43:05 ,And this is the conversations that some of us had behind the doors.

664
00:27:43,250 --> 00:27:45,041
, 00:27:45:00 ,The funny thing is, we're trying to put standards in place that

665
00:27:45,042 --> 00:27:47,374
, 00:27:47:08 ,will protect the business instead of saying it's illegal

666
00:27:47,375 --> 00:27:50,708
, 00:27:50:16 ,to collect information like some individuals want to do.

667
00:27:50,709 --> 00:27:51,998
, 00:27:51:25 ,We're just trying to have a balance to make sure people have their

668
00:27:51,999 --> 00:27:53,500
, 00:27:53:11 ,rights involved.

669
00:27:53,501 --> 00:27:55,917
, 00:27:55:21 ,They didn't want any of it, because at this point in time

670
00:27:55,918 --> 00:27:59,958
, 00:27:59:22 ,they can have the push back to kill some type of legislation.

671
00:27:59,959 --> 00:28:05,291
, 00:28:05:06 ,I obtained a very quick reputation with my quick tolerance for lobbyist.

672
00:28:05,292 --> 00:28:05,666
, 00:28:05:15

673
00:28:05,667 --> 00:28:07,958
, 00:28:07:22 ,I learned later on from a nicer older gentleman who

674
00:28:07,959 --> 00:28:12,124
, 00:28:12:02 ,has been around the block that they called me the Mad Russian.

675
00:28:12,125 --> 00:28:16,333
, 00:28:16:07 ,And I guess they were kind of right in some regards.

676
00:28:16,334 --> 00:28:18,998
, 00:28:18:27

677
00:28:18,999 --> 00:28:20,416
, 00:28:20:09 ,Okay.

678
00:28:20,417 --> 00:28:24,998
, 00:28:24:23 ,So also the understandability problems, partially generation problem.

679
00:28:24,999 --> 00:28:26,998
, 00:28:26:25 ,Politicians tend to be old.

680
00:28:26,999 --> 00:28:28,082
, 00:28:28:01 ,I'm 26.

681
00:28:28,083 --> 00:28:30,458
, 00:28:30:10 ,I'm serving in the House of Representatives.

682
00:28:30,459 --> 00:28:30,833
, 00:28:30:19

683
00:28:30,834 --> 00:28:33,416
, 00:28:33:09 ,Young Democrats and Republicans knew what we were talking

684
00:28:33,417 --> 00:28:35,666
, 00:28:35:15 ,on the privacy issue.

685
00:28:35,667 --> 00:28:39,666
, 00:28:39:15 ,They knew how far it has gone in this last 15 years.

686
00:28:39,667 --> 00:28:43,041
, 00:28:43:00 ,I'm not a tech guy, ironically I'm speaking at DEF CON.

687
00:28:43,042 --> 00:28:44,998
, 00:28:44:24

688
00:28:44,999 --> 00:28:48,166
, 00:28:48:03 ,I understand this is a big issue we need to work

689
00:28:48,167 --> 00:28:51,791
, 00:28:51:18 ,on and protect some rights if we can.

690
00:28:51,792 --> 00:28:53,458
, 00:28:53:10 ,That's the way I'm looking at it.

691
00:28:53,459 --> 00:28:55,999
, 00:28:55:29 ,There are only representatives in there on the Business

692
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,583
, 00:29:00:13 ,and Labor Committee who helped kill the bill in the end that barely knew how

693
00:29:00,584 --> 00:29:04,500
, 00:29:04:11 ,to use computers, that didn't have a smart phone.

694
00:29:04,501 --> 00:29:04,833
, 00:29:04:19

695
00:29:04,834 --> 00:29:07,249
, 00:29:07:05 ,I mean some barely use their phones at all.

696
00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:09,958
, 00:29:09:22 ,It was very interesting that they're the ones that we're trying to appeal

697
00:29:09,959 --> 00:29:11,458
, 00:29:11:10 ,to and they don't know what we're

698
00:29:11,459 --> 00:29:13,124
, 00:29:13:02 ,talking about.

699
00:29:13,125 --> 00:29:13,374
, 00:29:13:08

700
00:29:13,375 --> 00:29:16,625
, 00:29:16:14 ,Also, there's a lack of awareness on the privacy issue.

701
00:29:16,626 --> 00:29:17,998
, 00:29:17:26 ,Not an important issue.

702
00:29:17,999 --> 00:29:19,208
, 00:29:19:04 ,There are bigger issues.

703
00:29:19,209 --> 00:29:21,917
, 00:29:21:21 ,We had $300 mill to spend.

704
00:29:21,918 --> 00:29:23,998
, 00:29:23:27 ,It's more fun to spend other people's money than

705
00:29:23,999 --> 00:29:26,625
, 00:29:26:14 ,to protect people's rights.

706
00:29:26,626 --> 00:29:28,082
, 00:29:28:01

707
00:29:28,083 --> 00:29:32,750
, 00:29:32:17 ,A really quick story I have on the side.

708
00:29:32,751 --> 00:29:35,708
, 00:29:35:16 ,There was a Facebook bill, we called it the Facebook bill.

709
00:29:35,709 --> 00:29:36,166
, 00:29:36:03

710
00:29:36,167 --> 00:29:40,166
, 00:29:40:03 ,It would prevent employers from collecting employee's log

711
00:29:40,167 --> 00:29:44,374
, 00:29:44:08 ,in information, passwords along those lines.

712
00:29:44,375 --> 00:29:47,541
, 00:29:47:12 ,The city of Bozeman was doing it for a while and other organizations

713
00:29:47,542 --> 00:29:51,500
, 00:29:51:11 ,were saying, hey, you want to work for me, I need your log in information,

714
00:29:51,501 --> 00:29:54,750
, 00:29:54:17 ,your password, so I can search through your e mail accounts,

715
00:29:54,751 --> 00:29:57,291
, 00:29:57:06 ,search through your Facebook.

716
00:29:57,292 --> 00:29:59,082
, 00:29:59:01 ,To me it's the same thing as, hey, you want to work for me, I got

717
00:29:59,083 --> 00:30:02,291
, 00:30:02:06 ,to search through your house and your underwear drawer first.

718
00:30:02,292 --> 00:30:04,416
, 00:30:04:09 ,It's a little bit too much.

719
00:30:04,417 --> 00:30:07,041
, 00:30:07:00 ,So we're just trying to put some guidelines in place.

720
00:30:07,042 --> 00:30:08,998
, 00:30:08:24 ,It passed the Senate, 48 to 2.

721
00:30:08,999 --> 00:30:11,625
, 00:30:11:14 ,It got killed in the Business and Labor Committee.

722
00:30:11,626 --> 00:30:12,666
, 00:30:12:15

723
00:30:12,667 --> 00:30:14,708
, 00:30:14:16 ,48 to 2.

724
00:30:14,709 --> 00:30:16,333
, 00:30:16:07 ,This was a very controversial Senate that got

725
00:30:16,334 --> 00:30:20,124
, 00:30:20:02 ,some national headlines for how much they hit their heads.

726
00:30:20,125 --> 00:30:20,458
, 00:30:20:10

727
00:30:20,459 --> 00:30:24,166
, 00:30:24:03 ,They all voted, besides two of them, for this legislation.

728
00:30:24,167 --> 00:30:26,041
, 00:30:26:00 ,Business and Labor Committee, it goes to there,

729
00:30:26,042 --> 00:30:29,833
, 00:30:29:19 ,the business lobby tells a lot of the business and labor guys this

730
00:30:29,834 --> 00:30:32,998
, 00:30:32:28 ,is bad legislation, it needs to be killed.

731
00:30:32,999 --> 00:30:36,374
, 00:30:36:08 ,I heard a story on how there was a guy, a representative in his 70's,

732
00:30:36,375 --> 00:30:39,917
, 00:30:39:21 ,from what I understand barely knew what Facebook even is,

733
00:30:39,918 --> 00:30:42,291
, 00:30:42:06 ,not much how to hack it.

734
00:30:42,292 --> 00:30:42,917
, 00:30:42:21

735
00:30:42,918 --> 00:30:44,999
, 00:30:44:29 ,He barely knew what it was.

736
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,041
, 00:30:46:00 ,He heard that he asked the younger guy,

737
00:30:46,042 --> 00:30:50,458
, 00:30:50:10 ,a younger representative, hey, is this good or bad legislation.

738
00:30:50,459 --> 00:30:53,208
, 00:30:53:04 ,The younger guy who appeals to lobbyists and plays

739
00:30:53,209 --> 00:30:58,374
, 00:30:58:08 ,the political game, the exact opposite of me, plays it.

740
00:30:58,375 --> 00:31:02,998
, 00:31:02:23 ,He told him oh, this is a really bad bill, really bad for business.

741
00:31:02,999 --> 00:31:04,082
, 00:31:04:01 ,We need to kill this bill.

742
00:31:04,083 --> 00:31:06,374
, 00:31:06:08 ,There is your policy setting right there.

743
00:31:06,375 --> 00:31:08,958
, 00:31:08:22 ,Older guy doesn't know what he's doing, younger guy says killing it

744
00:31:08,959 --> 00:31:11,625
, 00:31:11:14 ,because he's worried about getting a better voting record

745
00:31:11,626 --> 00:31:13,124
, 00:31:13:02 ,at the end.

746
00:31:13,125 --> 00:31:15,998
, 00:31:15:26

747
00:31:15,999 --> 00:31:18,998
, 00:31:18:23 ,The bill was 26 pages long.

748
00:31:18,999 --> 00:31:20,500
, 00:31:20:11 ,It's all new legislation.

749
00:31:20,501 --> 00:31:23,082
, 00:31:23:01 ,This is a big bill by Montana standards.

750
00:31:23,083 --> 00:31:26,166
, 00:31:26:03 ,Obama's Affordable Care Act, I don't care what side you're on,

751
00:31:26,167 --> 00:31:30,333
, 00:31:30:07 ,that issue, but that bill itself is a thousand pages.

752
00:31:30,334 --> 00:31:32,583
, 00:31:32:13 ,That's a big bill in my opinion.

753
00:31:32,584 --> 00:31:34,917
, 00:31:34:21 ,This is 26 pages in Montana legal speak

754
00:31:34,918 --> 00:31:40,458
, 00:31:40:10 ,in a sense that it's really easy to understand Montana code.

755
00:31:40,459 --> 00:31:42,625
, 00:31:42:14 ,You can read it, not having any legislation experience

756
00:31:42,626 --> 00:31:44,708
, 00:31:44:16 ,and understand it.

757
00:31:44,709 --> 00:31:45,583
, 00:31:45:13

758
00:31:45,584 --> 00:31:47,249
, 00:31:47:05 ,Very simple.

759
00:31:47,250 --> 00:31:47,750
, 00:31:47:17

760
00:31:47,751 --> 00:31:49,500
, 00:31:49:11 ,This bill is considered 26 pages long

761
00:31:49,501 --> 00:31:51,999
, 00:31:51:29 ,and that was way too long.

762
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:52,999
, 00:31:52:29 ,It was complex.

763
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,166
, 00:31:55:03 ,We would have to have our own privacy standards

764
00:31:55,167 --> 00:31:57,333
, 00:31:57:07 ,for Montana than the rest of the country, which

765
00:31:57,334 --> 00:31:59,124
, 00:31:59:02 ,is what we wanted.

766
00:31:59,125 --> 00:32:00,750
, 00:32:00:17

767
00:32:00,751 --> 00:32:03,166
, 00:32:03:03 ,It's what we wanted, because then we wanted other states

768
00:32:03,167 --> 00:32:05,374
, 00:32:05:08 ,to follow our legislation.

769
00:32:05,375 --> 00:32:07,958
, 00:32:07:22 ,If we can do it, then you can do it.

770
00:32:07,959 --> 00:32:08,249
, 00:32:08:05

771
00:32:08,250 --> 00:32:11,124
, 00:32:11:02 ,It also proposed a lot of new ideas in one document.

772
00:32:11,125 --> 00:32:11,458
, 00:32:11:10

773
00:32:11,459 --> 00:32:14,998
, 00:32:14:24 ,Things you don't understand are new can be kind of scary.

774
00:32:14,999 --> 00:32:17,249
, 00:32:17:05 ,So we ran into those issues.

775
00:32:17,250 --> 00:32:17,917
, 00:32:17:21

776
00:32:17,918 --> 00:32:20,124
, 00:32:20:02 ,Now, let me go in the committee meeting.

777
00:32:20,125 --> 00:32:20,500
, 00:32:20:11

778
00:32:20,501 --> 00:32:21,998
, 00:32:21:26 ,There were two proponent.

779
00:32:21,999 --> 00:32:23,998
, 00:32:23:27 ,I was a sponsor, so I spoke first.

780
00:32:23,999 --> 00:32:26,958
, 00:32:26:22 ,There were two proponents of this bill.

781
00:32:26,959 --> 00:32:29,998
, 00:32:29:24 ,One is Eric, so thanks for showing up today.

782
00:32:29,999 --> 00:32:32,999
, 00:32:32:29 ,   ERIC FULTON: I think I should probably wake up to that one.

783
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:33,999
, 00:32:33:29 ,(applause).

784
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,625
, 00:32:35:14 ,   DANIEL ZOLNIKOV: And ACLU.

785
00:32:35,626 --> 00:32:38,708
, 00:32:38:16 ,I was so happy someone was sitting next to me in that meeting.

786
00:32:38,709 --> 00:32:39,458
, 00:32:39:10

787
00:32:39,459 --> 00:32:43,500
, 00:32:43:11 ,As a conservative Republican I'm usually over here.

788
00:32:43,501 --> 00:32:44,998
, 00:32:44:26 ,The ACLU is usually over here.

789
00:32:44,999 --> 00:32:47,666
, 00:32:47:15 ,Now, not only me, a few of us are trying they're ignoring them

790
00:32:47,667 --> 00:32:51,625
, 00:32:51:14 ,because we're bothering them so much, we're trying to find more legislation

791
00:32:51,626 --> 00:32:55,998
, 00:32:55:23 ,like this, because we agree on privacy legislation to work on.

792
00:32:55,999 --> 00:32:59,666
, 00:32:59:15 ,I'm very thankful they're supportive and willing to work on.

793
00:32:59,667 --> 00:32:59,917
, 00:32:59:21

794
00:32:59,918 --> 00:33:02,998
, 00:33:02:27 ,The cellphone privacy bill, they are supportive.

795
00:33:02,999 --> 00:33:11,625
, 00:33:11:14

796
00:33:11,626 --> 00:33:14,998
, 00:33:14:25 ,The supporters, the Montana Retailers Association,

797
00:33:14,999 --> 00:33:19,082
, 00:33:19:01 ,multiple insurance companies, Montana Auto Dealers Association,

798
00:33:19,083 --> 00:33:23,124
, 00:33:23:02 ,Montana Bankers Association, multiple hospitals, the Chamber

799
00:33:23,125 --> 00:33:27,082
, 00:33:27:01 ,of Commerce, the Montana Data Association.

800
00:33:27,083 --> 00:33:30,416
, 00:33:30:09 ,If that room had been exploded, there would have been no more

801
00:33:30,417 --> 00:33:33,791
, 00:33:33:18 ,lobbyists for the business front in Helena.

802
00:33:33,792 --> 00:33:36,124
, 00:33:36:02

803
00:33:36,125 --> 00:33:37,291
, 00:33:37:06 ,(applause).

804
00:33:37,292 --> 00:33:41,249
, 00:33:41:05 ,   ERIC FULTON: They literally queued to say the same thing.

805
00:33:41,250 --> 00:33:41,541
, 00:33:41:12

806
00:33:41,542 --> 00:33:44,750
, 00:33:44:17 ,It was lining up and raising their hand.

807
00:33:44,751 --> 00:33:49,124
, 00:33:49:02 ,It was more said why they didn't like it, that basically it hurt business.

808
00:33:49,125 --> 00:33:50,999
, 00:33:50:29 ,   DANIEL ZOLNIKOV: As a new representative, they want

809
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,583
, 00:33:53:13 ,to prove a point to me, hey, if you're not going

810
00:33:53,584 --> 00:33:57,958
, 00:33:57:22 ,to be doing what we need you to do, this will what will happen.

811
00:33:57,959 --> 00:33:59,750
, 00:33:59:17 ,I am a very slow learner.

812
00:33:59,751 --> 00:33:59,958
, 00:33:59:22

813
00:33:59,959 --> 00:34:02,500
, 00:34:02:11 ,Next time we'll see what happens.

814
00:34:02,501 --> 00:34:02,958
, 00:34:02:22

815
00:34:02,959 --> 00:34:04,208
, 00:34:04:04 ,(applause).

816
00:34:04,209 --> 00:34:04,625
, 00:34:04:14

817
00:34:04,626 --> 00:34:09,998
, 00:34:09:23 ,Also, the committee meeting, let me just one thing in politics.

818
00:34:09,999 --> 00:34:12,998
, 00:34:12:24 ,Say you're with privacy legislation.

819
00:34:12,999 --> 00:34:14,998
, 00:34:14:23

820
00:34:14,999 --> 00:34:18,833
, 00:34:18:19 ,We deal with legislation across all these different areas.

821
00:34:18,834 --> 00:34:20,750
, 00:34:20:17 ,So how much do you know about farming?

822
00:34:20,751 --> 00:34:20,958
, 00:34:20:22

823
00:34:20,959 --> 00:34:21,958
, 00:34:21:22 ,Okay.

824
00:34:21,959 --> 00:34:22,998
, 00:34:22:28 ,There's a farming bill.

825
00:34:22,999 --> 00:34:24,541
, 00:34:24:12 ,How much do you care about it.

826
00:34:24,542 --> 00:34:27,666
, 00:34:27:15 ,I still wouldn't trust my views on farming to know what this legislation

827
00:34:27,667 --> 00:34:29,833
, 00:34:29:19 ,is going to get passed.

828
00:34:29,834 --> 00:34:31,750
, 00:34:31:17 ,I have to depend on someone else.

829
00:34:31,751 --> 00:34:32,998
, 00:34:32:25 ,It's not really my issue.

830
00:34:32,999 --> 00:34:33,998
, 00:34:33:23 ,It sounds good.

831
00:34:33,999 --> 00:34:34,998
, 00:34:34:23 ,It's a short bill.

832
00:34:34,999 --> 00:34:37,999
, 00:34:37:29 ,Three main points for it; three main points against it.

833
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,583
, 00:34:41:13 ,I'm hitting 10 or 20 bills a day I understand I'm reading past.

834
00:34:41,584 --> 00:34:41,998
, 00:34:41:23

835
00:34:41,999 --> 00:34:45,999
, 00:34:45:29 ,So this was basically the farming bill in the sense.

836
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,708
, 00:34:48:16 ,They were not concerned about a privacy rights.

837
00:34:48,709 --> 00:34:49,708
, 00:34:49:16 ,It's not an issue.

838
00:34:49,709 --> 00:34:50,998
, 00:34:50:24 ,It's a nonissue issue.

839
00:34:50,999 --> 00:34:52,249
, 00:34:52:05 ,So on the doors I knocked on a lot of doors

840
00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:56,124
, 00:34:56:02 ,for the campaign no one was talking about privacy rights.

841
00:34:56,125 --> 00:34:56,998
, 00:34:56:26

842
00:34:56,999 --> 00:35:01,791
, 00:35:01:18 ,They're talking about money, taxes, jobs, not this issue.

843
00:35:01,792 --> 00:35:04,500
, 00:35:04:11 ,So the committee members were pretty much unengaged.

844
00:35:04,501 --> 00:35:08,416
, 00:35:08:09 ,So in a roundabout way, thank you for bringing awareness to the issue.

845
00:35:08,417 --> 00:35:11,998
, 00:35:11:23 ,   ERIC FULTON: You got to look at the silver lining just a little bit.

846
00:35:11,999 --> 00:35:14,666
, 00:35:14:15 ,   DANIEL ZOLNIKOV: Okay.

847
00:35:14,667 --> 00:35:17,998
, 00:35:17:26 ,So the end results was that it was tabled in committee.

848
00:35:17,999 --> 00:35:20,666
, 00:35:20:15 ,Duh duh duh.

849
00:35:20,667 --> 00:35:23,625
, 00:35:23:14 ,The wrong committee in the first place and nearly

850
00:35:23,626 --> 00:35:28,124
, 00:35:28:02 ,all the lobbyists that go along with the Republican side were not

851
00:35:28,125 --> 00:35:32,500
, 00:35:32:11 ,supportive of any type of privacy legislation.

852
00:35:32,501 --> 00:35:36,875
, 00:35:36:20

853
00:35:36,876 --> 00:35:39,500
, 00:35:39:11 ,They wanted to be exempt from it.

854
00:35:39,501 --> 00:35:41,666
, 00:35:41:15 ,They don't want it to be applying to them.

855
00:35:41,667 --> 00:35:42,999
, 00:35:42:29

856
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,583
, 00:35:45:13 ,We want to make sure that personal information

857
00:35:45,584 --> 00:35:47,998
, 00:35:47:27 ,belongs to the individual.

858
00:35:47,999 --> 00:35:49,374
, 00:35:49:08

859
00:35:49,375 --> 00:35:52,625
, 00:35:52:14 ,The bill was too large and most legislators didn't understand

860
00:35:52,626 --> 00:35:55,249
, 00:35:55:05 ,why we needed the legislation.

861
00:35:55,250 --> 00:35:57,291
, 00:35:57:06 ,It was a nonissue issue.

862
00:35:57,292 --> 00:35:58,374
, 00:35:58:08

863
00:35:58,375 --> 00:36:01,082
, 00:36:01:01 ,HB 400 was considered growing government

864
00:36:01,083 --> 00:36:04,124
, 00:36:04:02 ,and creating unnecessary laws.

865
00:36:04,125 --> 00:36:08,791
, 00:36:08:18 ,I was considered a big government conservative.

866
00:36:08,792 --> 00:36:10,541
, 00:36:10:12

867
00:36:10,542 --> 00:36:14,333
, 00:36:14:07 ,Whatever, they could label it however they want,

868
00:36:14,334 --> 00:36:16,500
, 00:36:16:11 ,that was fine.

869
00:36:16,501 --> 00:36:18,999
, 00:36:18:29 ,   ERIC FULTON: I prefer the nickname mad Russian.

870
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:31,666
, 00:36:31:15

871
00:36:31,667 --> 00:36:36,208
, 00:36:36:04 ,What happened and what we realized is we tried way too much.

872
00:36:36,209 --> 00:36:37,082
, 00:36:37:01

873
00:36:37,083 --> 00:36:40,791
, 00:36:40:18 ,26 pages for Montana is about 25 pages longer than most

874
00:36:40,792 --> 00:36:42,583
, 00:36:42:13 ,other bills.

875
00:36:42,584 --> 00:36:42,998
, 00:36:42:23

876
00:36:42,999 --> 00:36:44,249
, 00:36:44:05 ,(laughter).

877
00:36:44,250 --> 00:36:44,708
, 00:36:44:16

878
00:36:44,709 --> 00:36:46,998
, 00:36:46:26 ,So we'll try and break it down.

879
00:36:46,999 --> 00:36:49,249
, 00:36:49:05 ,We realized that at that time privacy didn't affect

880
00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:51,124
, 00:36:51:02 ,people directly.

881
00:36:51,125 --> 00:36:52,917
, 00:36:52:21 ,It wasn't something they could tangibly see and touch

882
00:36:52,918 --> 00:36:55,416
, 00:36:55:09 ,and be afraid of or happy about.

883
00:36:55,417 --> 00:36:55,666
, 00:36:55:15

884
00:36:55,667 --> 00:36:59,041
, 00:36:59:00 ,And so we were two or three months ahead of our time.

885
00:36:59,042 --> 00:36:59,458
, 00:36:59:10

886
00:36:59,459 --> 00:37:02,166
, 00:37:02:03 ,And then we didn't really compromise it.

887
00:37:02,167 --> 00:37:06,333
, 00:37:06:07 ,Then more so, I want to thank them for being solid and not compromising

888
00:37:06,334 --> 00:37:08,750
, 00:37:08:17 ,on privacy kind of.

889
00:37:08,751 --> 00:37:10,708
, 00:37:10:16 ,He was there the whole way to make sure that we had

890
00:37:10,709 --> 00:37:14,625
, 00:37:14:14 ,the full privacy, but we also realized is at a certain point businesses still

891
00:37:14,626 --> 00:37:16,500
, 00:37:16:11 ,have to operate.

892
00:37:16,501 --> 00:37:20,166
, 00:37:20:03 ,And we can't just put on a lot of legislation to make privacy better

893
00:37:20,167 --> 00:37:23,917
, 00:37:23:21 ,on the citizen rights side, but make it so burdensome that

894
00:37:23,918 --> 00:37:27,333
, 00:37:27:07 ,a small business can't actually operate.

895
00:37:27,334 --> 00:37:27,583
, 00:37:27:13

896
00:37:27,584 --> 00:37:30,875
, 00:37:30:20 ,So we realized we still need to work with these people.

897
00:37:30,876 --> 00:37:32,833
, 00:37:32:19 ,I had some additional thoughts.

898
00:37:32,834 --> 00:37:32,999
, 00:37:32:29

899
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:38,208
, 00:37:38:04 ,   DANIEL ZOLNIKOV: 26 years old, first time serving, still a lot to learn.

900
00:37:38,209 --> 00:37:39,666
, 00:37:39:15 ,   ERIC FULTON: Yeah, yeah.

901
00:37:39,667 --> 00:37:40,666
, 00:37:40:15 ,We had to grow.

902
00:37:40,667 --> 00:37:42,291
, 00:37:42:06 ,There's a lot of informal opportunities we didn't

903
00:37:42,292 --> 00:37:44,374
, 00:37:44:08 ,realize had to be done.

904
00:37:44,375 --> 00:37:46,999
, 00:37:46:29 ,We didn't fund raise.

905
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:50,999
, 00:37:50:29 ,You need money to push ideas, apparently.

906
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:51,999
, 00:37:51:29 ,(laughter).

907
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,208
, 00:37:54:04 ,However, we're working on it we didn't have

908
00:37:54,209 --> 00:37:58,875
, 00:37:58:20 ,a story that basically people could latch on.

909
00:37:58,876 --> 00:38:00,333
, 00:38:00:07 ,We didn't have a story that people could look

910
00:38:00,334 --> 00:38:03,625
, 00:38:03:14 ,at it say oh, my gosh, this is why I need privacy.

911
00:38:03,626 --> 00:38:06,875
, 00:38:06:20 ,To a limited extent we now have that story with Prism.

912
00:38:06,876 --> 00:38:07,208
, 00:38:07:04

913
00:38:07,209 --> 00:38:11,833
, 00:38:11:19 ,So there was some funny, unexpected results that came out of it.

914
00:38:11,834 --> 00:38:13,082
, 00:38:13:01 ,   DANIEL ZOLNIKOV: Okay.

915
00:38:13,083 --> 00:38:16,833
, 00:38:16:19 ,So this is an award that I received from another fellow representative.

916
00:38:16,834 --> 00:38:19,917
, 00:38:19:21 ,The owner of the black helicopter for representative Daniel Zolnikov

917
00:38:19,918 --> 00:38:24,998
, 00:38:24:26 ,for the outstanding conspiracy theory from the man in the yellow hat.

918
00:38:24,999 --> 00:38:27,625
, 00:38:27:14 ,He gave me a black helicopter.

919
00:38:27,626 --> 00:38:30,958
, 00:38:30:22

920
00:38:30,959 --> 00:38:34,541
, 00:38:34:12 ,   ERIC FULTON: Have you talked to him since did he that?

921
00:38:34,542 --> 00:38:34,833
, 00:38:34:19

922
00:38:34,834 --> 00:38:38,124
, 00:38:38:02 ,   DANIEL ZOLNIKOV: I spoke to him, and he said he's sorry and that

923
00:38:38,125 --> 00:38:41,666
, 00:38:41:15 ,he definitely supports my legislation now.

924
00:38:41,667 --> 00:38:42,708
, 00:38:42:16 ,(laughter).

925
00:38:42,709 --> 00:38:52,458
, 00:38:52:10

926
00:38:52,459 --> 00:38:54,208
, 00:38:54:04 ,Another thing is the lobbyists took me

927
00:38:54,209 --> 00:38:56,249
, 00:38:56:05 ,a little less serious.

928
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:57,999
, 00:38:57:29 ,Some took me more serious.

929
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,541
, 00:38:59:12 ,If they went against anything I was doing,

930
00:38:59,542 --> 00:39:02,291
, 00:39:02:06 ,they spoke to me because they knew I could care less

931
00:39:02,292 --> 00:39:04,374
, 00:39:04:08 ,on their stances in that I was not okay

932
00:39:04,375 --> 00:39:09,124
, 00:39:09:02 ,with the whole special interest thing, not keeping other people in mind.

933
00:39:09,125 --> 00:39:13,333
, 00:39:13:07 ,So I get taken a little less serious by some who don't speak to me at all.

934
00:39:13,334 --> 00:39:13,750
, 00:39:13:17

935
00:39:13,751 --> 00:39:16,998
, 00:39:16:27 ,Those are the ones I respect a little bit less anyway.

936
00:39:16,999 --> 00:39:19,082
, 00:39:19:01 ,Then there are some that I talk with and they make sure where I'm

937
00:39:19,083 --> 00:39:21,208
, 00:39:21:04 ,at and they see where I'm at.

938
00:39:21,209 --> 00:39:22,208
, 00:39:22:04 ,It's a good thing.

939
00:39:22,209 --> 00:39:26,124
, 00:39:26:02 ,It's a lot better communications and it's served a lot better.

940
00:39:26,125 --> 00:39:26,333
, 00:39:26:07

941
00:39:26,334 --> 00:39:31,249
, 00:39:31:05 ,A lost groups and representatives know my groups on special interest.

942
00:39:31,250 --> 00:39:33,875
, 00:39:33:20 ,I'm not serving as special interest.

943
00:39:33,876 --> 00:39:35,791
, 00:39:35:18 ,I'm serving on what's best for people.

944
00:39:35,792 --> 00:39:38,750
, 00:39:38:17 ,I thought that's what government was for.

945
00:39:38,751 --> 00:39:41,208
, 00:39:41:04 ,My election will be a lot tougher.

946
00:39:41,209 --> 00:39:43,208
, 00:39:43:04

947
00:39:43,209 --> 00:39:46,374
, 00:39:46:08 ,Now I'm getting a lot of support, so it's fine.

948
00:39:46,375 --> 00:39:51,208
, 00:39:51:04

949
00:39:51,209 --> 00:39:52,416
, 00:39:52:09 ,(applause).

950
00:39:52,417 --> 00:39:53,625
, 00:39:53:14

951
00:39:53,626 --> 00:39:57,583
, 00:39:57:13 ,   We had seven points and we'll break it down into seven individual topics so

952
00:39:57,584 --> 00:40:00,666
, 00:40:00:15 ,each one can have a compelling story, so we can build support

953
00:40:00,667 --> 00:40:02,791
, 00:40:02:18 ,and work with people.

954
00:40:02,792 --> 00:40:02,999
, 00:40:02:29

955
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,833
, 00:40:04:19 ,We'll create clear cases.

956
00:40:04,834 --> 00:40:08,583
, 00:40:08:13 ,We'll work with businesses so they understand our goals

957
00:40:08,584 --> 00:40:12,998
, 00:40:12:28 ,and that we understand their hardships to a point.

958
00:40:12,999 --> 00:40:13,500
, 00:40:13:11

959
00:40:13,501 --> 00:40:17,291
, 00:40:17:06 ,Because at a certain point businesses would rather just not worry about it.

960
00:40:17,292 --> 00:40:20,998
, 00:40:20:23 ,I've got their information, I'm not going to worry about securing it.

961
00:40:20,999 --> 00:40:22,625
, 00:40:22:14 ,So it's about building a balance.

962
00:40:22,626 --> 00:40:22,958
, 00:40:22:22

963
00:40:22,959 --> 00:40:25,291
, 00:40:25:06 ,So we have a goal.

964
00:40:25,292 --> 00:40:28,583
, 00:40:28:13 ,   DANIEL ZOLNIKOV: Consent.

965
00:40:28,584 --> 00:40:30,208
, 00:40:30:04 ,It's only two pages.

966
00:40:30,209 --> 00:40:30,500
, 00:40:30:11

967
00:40:30,501 --> 00:40:32,625
, 00:40:32:14 ,It's the first part of the bill.

968
00:40:32,626 --> 00:40:33,791
, 00:40:33:18 ,Consent is the most important part

969
00:40:33,792 --> 00:40:36,708
, 00:40:36:16 ,because it says that this information being collected

970
00:40:36,709 --> 00:40:40,249
, 00:40:40:05 ,is actually your information, not the people or the organizations

971
00:40:40,250 --> 00:40:42,999
, 00:40:42:29 ,or departments that collect it.

972
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,500
, 00:40:44:11 ,It's not their information.

973
00:40:44,501 --> 00:40:45,500
, 00:40:45:11 ,It's still yours.

974
00:40:45,501 --> 00:40:47,166
, 00:40:47:03 ,So consent implies just that.

975
00:40:47,167 --> 00:40:49,458
, 00:40:49:10 ,If you give consent, most people give consent anyway,

976
00:40:49,459 --> 00:40:53,750
, 00:40:53:17 ,but we need to to say that this actually does belong to me.

977
00:40:53,751 --> 00:40:55,917
, 00:40:55:21 ,It's the first step the ladder to privacy.

978
00:40:55,918 --> 00:40:58,833
, 00:40:58:19 ,If there's time, we have some more laws on the book.

979
00:40:58,834 --> 00:40:59,291
, 00:40:59:06

980
00:40:59,292 --> 00:41:02,082
, 00:41:02:01 ,There's the protecting sources of the press.

981
00:41:02,083 --> 00:41:04,416
, 00:41:04:09 ,I think this is one of the most important ones.

982
00:41:04,417 --> 00:41:06,541
, 00:41:06:12 ,We're playing around with that one still.

983
00:41:06,542 --> 00:41:07,541
, 00:41:07:12 ,(applause).

984
00:41:07,542 --> 00:41:10,999
, 00:41:10:29 ,First Amendment, we need to start legislating our rights.

985
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,998
, 00:41:12:26

986
00:41:12,999 --> 00:41:15,166
, 00:41:15:03 ,We need to start today.

987
00:41:15,167 --> 00:41:17,998
, 00:41:17:27 ,That includes protecting the press and also allowing citizens

988
00:41:17,999 --> 00:41:22,958
, 00:41:22:22 ,to disable black boxes from their cars, something along those lines.

989
00:41:22,959 --> 00:41:23,124
, 00:41:23:02

990
00:41:23,125 --> 00:41:25,625
, 00:41:25:14 ,You drive around, you should not be having collecting

991
00:41:25,626 --> 00:41:29,458
, 00:41:29:10 ,evidence against yourself for possible future cases.

992
00:41:29,459 --> 00:41:30,208
, 00:41:30:04 ,The last one is any automated license plate

993
00:41:30,209 --> 00:41:33,124
, 00:41:33:02 ,scanning and collection for the state of Montana.

994
00:41:33,125 --> 00:41:35,082
, 00:41:35:01

995
00:41:35,083 --> 00:41:36,374
, 00:41:36:08 ,(applause).

996
00:41:36,375 --> 00:41:38,333
, 00:41:38:07 ,They're currently banned in Montana.

997
00:41:38,334 --> 00:41:41,625
, 00:41:41:14

998
00:41:41,626 --> 00:41:43,998
, 00:41:43:24 ,We're working on it.

999
00:41:43,999 --> 00:41:44,166
, 00:41:44:03

1000
00:41:44,167 --> 00:41:45,374
, 00:41:45:08 ,   ERIC FULTON: We're in our final minutes,

1001
00:41:45,375 --> 00:41:47,291
, 00:41:47:06 ,so we're speeding up.

1002
00:41:47,292 --> 00:41:50,998
, 00:41:50:23 ,It all leads to privacy legislation.

1003
00:41:50,999 --> 00:41:54,875
, 00:41:54:20 ,Montana is a test bed for privacy, a test bed for other legislation so other

1004
00:41:54,876 --> 00:41:59,875
, 00:41:59:20 ,states can say this will never happen, you can go Montana did it.

1005
00:41:59,876 --> 00:42:01,998
, 00:42:01:24 ,States rights setting a legal precedent for privacy

1006
00:42:01,999 --> 00:42:05,291
, 00:42:05:06 ,and working for citizens and not lobbyists.

1007
00:42:05,292 --> 00:42:10,249
, 00:42:10:05

1008
00:42:10,250 --> 00:42:15,833
, 00:42:15:19 ,It's hard to get angry this early in the morning, but we're almost done.

1009
00:42:15,834 --> 00:42:16,998
, 00:42:16:28 ,We're almost done.

1010
00:42:16,999 --> 00:42:17,208
, 00:42:17:04

1011
00:42:17,209 --> 00:42:18,666
, 00:42:18:15 ,And I'm going to read you something

1012
00:42:18,667 --> 00:42:22,082
, 00:42:22:01 ,from Wire Magazine that gets me a little annoyed, a little angered,

1013
00:42:22,083 --> 00:42:23,875
, 00:42:23:20 ,if you will.

1014
00:42:23,876 --> 00:42:26,833
, 00:42:26:19 ,And so I think you will, too, when you hear it.

1015
00:42:26,834 --> 00:42:27,958
, 00:42:27:22 ,"

1016
00:42:27,959 --> 00:42:30,082
, 00:42:30:01 ,The Obama administration for the first time responded

1017
00:42:30,083 --> 00:42:32,998
, 00:42:32:25 ,to the spy gate lawsuit telling a federal judge

1018
00:42:32,999 --> 00:42:36,666
, 00:42:36:15 ,the wholesale vacuuming up of phone data in the United States

1019
00:42:36,667 --> 00:42:40,791
, 00:42:40:18 ,is in the public interest does not breach the constitutional rights

1020
00:42:40,792 --> 00:42:45,208
, 00:42:45:04 ,of Americans and cannot be challenged in a court of law."

1021
00:42:45,209 --> 00:42:45,666
, 00:42:45:15

1022
00:42:45,667 --> 00:42:47,999
, 00:42:47:29 ,I put emphasis, that the executive branch is telling

1023
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:52,041
, 00:42:52:00 ,the judicial branch that they cannot challenge that.

1024
00:42:52,042 --> 00:42:52,249
, 00:42:52:05

1025
00:42:52,250 --> 00:42:54,041
, 00:42:54:00 ,I submit when the people can no longer challenge

1026
00:42:54,042 --> 00:42:56,791
, 00:42:56:18 ,the government, that government cannot necessarily be

1027
00:42:56,792 --> 00:42:58,750
, 00:42:58:17 ,called a democracy.

1028
00:42:58,751 --> 00:43:00,875
, 00:43:00:20

1029
00:43:00,876 --> 00:43:02,124
, 00:43:02:02 ,(applause).

1030
00:43:02,125 --> 00:43:04,166
, 00:43:04:03

1031
00:43:04,167 --> 00:43:07,124
, 00:43:07:02 ,At the end of the day, all of us are responsible

1032
00:43:07,125 --> 00:43:10,416
, 00:43:10:09 ,for the policies that we live under.

1033
00:43:10,417 --> 00:43:12,458
, 00:43:12:10 ,So there's still power and mistakes.

1034
00:43:12,459 --> 00:43:15,208
, 00:43:15:04 ,We do more than pay attention.

1035
00:43:15,209 --> 00:43:16,249
, 00:43:16:05 ,Do more than.

1036
00:43:16,250 --> 00:43:16,500

1041
00:43:23,709 --> 00:43:27,082
, 00:43:27:01 ,We already have laws based on two people that have full time jobs

1042
00:43:27,083 --> 00:43:29,998
, 00:43:29:23 ,and felt like making a difference.

, 00:43:42:05 ,   Eric and I are both running the next time in Montana.

1048
00:43:42,250 --> 00:43:44,416
, 00:43:44:09 ,The whole thing is if you stand up to special interest,

1049
00:43:44,417 --> 00:43:47,999
, 00:43:47:29 ,sometimes you lose their support, but Montana has really low contribution

1050
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,833
, 00:43:51:19 ,limits of like $160 a person, so the whole same thing when it's that low,

1051
00:43:51,834 --> 00:43:54,333
, 00:43:54:07 ,I can say good bye to those guys and hello to people
