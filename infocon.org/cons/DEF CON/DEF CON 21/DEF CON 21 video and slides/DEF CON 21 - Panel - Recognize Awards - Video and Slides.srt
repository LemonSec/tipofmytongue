1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,999
We're up on the confidence screen?

2
00:00:01,999 --> 00:00:02,999
Not the big screen.

3
00:00:02,999 --> 00:00:03,999
There we go.

4
00:00:03,999 --> 00:00:03,999
Advance one slide so she can make sure everything

5
00:00:03,999 --> 00:00:04,999
is in frame.

6
00:00:04,999 --> 00:00:05,999
Oh, hey!

7
00:00:05,999 --> 00:00:07,667
Wait, you two have the same hat.

8
00:00:07,667 --> 00:00:09,083
(Laughter.)    Mine is cooler.

9
00:00:09,083 --> 00:00:10,083
Has fewer brains.

10
00:00:10,083 --> 00:00:11,083
His is more pimp.

11
00:00:11,083 --> 00:00:12,417
Everybody in the hall?

12
00:00:12,417 --> 00:00:15,042
If you want to win prices and have shots, come in here.

13
00:00:15,042 --> 00:00:18,000
Everybody in the hall, shots for the winners in this room.

14
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,626
Not TB shots, you jack-wagon.

15
00:00:19,626 --> 00:00:19,626
(Speaker away from microphone.)    I believe we have

16
00:00:19,626 --> 00:00:21,375
Skye vodka and what is the other one?

17
00:00:21,375 --> 00:00:22,459
We also have crack.

18
00:00:22,459 --> 00:00:23,501
Smack you so hard.

19
00:00:23,501 --> 00:00:24,501
You know what?

20
00:00:24,501 --> 00:00:26,999
I'll give you a shot if you'll take it straight up.

21
00:00:26,999 --> 00:00:27,999
Come on.

22
00:00:27,999 --> 00:00:28,999
It's free.

23
00:00:28,999 --> 00:00:30,584
You don't have to be a winner.

24
00:00:30,584 --> 00:00:31,999
But you have to drink it.

25
00:00:31,999 --> 00:00:33,876
Yeah, I just want to see you drink it.

26
00:00:33,876 --> 00:00:35,042
Are these bottles open?

27
00:00:35,042 --> 00:00:36,042
Nope.

28
00:00:36,042 --> 00:00:37,042
If you want to.

29
00:00:37,042 --> 00:00:37,042
I figured everyone would feel better if they were closed,

30
00:00:37,042 --> 00:00:38,042
then opened in here.

31
00:00:38,042 --> 00:00:39,999
Ladies and gentlemen, DC Awards.

32
00:00:39,999 --> 00:00:42,167
(Applause.)    RUSS: Good morning, DEF CON.

33
00:00:42,167 --> 00:00:42,167
(Cheering.)    RUSS: I say that because probably half

34
00:00:42,167 --> 00:00:44,000
of you just got out of bed, didn't you?

35
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,999
And the other half of going right back to bed once we've emptied the bottles.

36
00:00:47,999 --> 00:00:48,999
Bye!

37
00:00:48,999 --> 00:00:49,999
We'll miss you.

38
00:00:49,999 --> 00:00:51,167
Welcome to DEF CON awards.

39
00:00:51,167 --> 00:00:52,167
I am Russ.

40
00:00:52,167 --> 00:00:53,167
This is Jericho.

41
00:00:53,167 --> 00:00:55,834
And over here we have the invisible Dark Tangent.

42
00:00:55,834 --> 00:00:58,542
He was here Year 1 and has been missing in action since.

43
00:00:58,542 --> 00:01:01,083
If you see him in the hallways, tell him we're here.

44
00:01:01,083 --> 00:01:04,250
Let's talk a little bit about what the awards are, how it works.

45
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:05,250
First slide is why.

46
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:06,918
Why did we do the DEF CON Awards?

47
00:01:06,918 --> 00:01:07,918
Right?

48
00:01:07,918 --> 00:01:07,918
We have people that sit around and complain or brag

49
00:01:07,918 --> 00:01:09,999
about accomplishments, things like that.

50
00:01:09,999 --> 00:01:09,999
We wanted to recognize those things

51
00:01:09,999 --> 00:01:12,083
but we wanted to be a little bit different.

52
00:01:12,083 --> 00:01:12,083
It is important to note that we did not vote on this,

53
00:01:12,083 --> 00:01:13,083
all right?

54
00:01:13,083 --> 00:01:13,834
We get up here and get to talk about it, but people

55
00:01:13,834 --> 00:01:17,959
in the community nominated all these individuals or organizations

56
00:01:17,959 --> 00:01:19,999
for the categories.

57
00:01:19,999 --> 00:01:21,250
We didn't vote.

58
00:01:21,375 --> 00:01:24,834
We had organizational input only.

59
00:01:25,417 --> 00:01:30,167
And we do it so that you get recognition for good things that you do when you

60
00:01:30,167 --> 00:01:35,709
kick ass and you get great recognition when you do really shitty stuff.

61
00:01:36,209 --> 00:01:37,999
And that's why we are here.

62
00:01:38,999 --> 00:01:41,876
These are all public nominations.

63
00:01:41,876 --> 00:01:43,999
We open this up to the entire world.

64
00:01:44,125 --> 00:01:46,083
We have been getting steadily more and more nominations

65
00:01:46,083 --> 00:01:48,999
over the last few years that we've done this.

66
00:01:49,375 --> 00:01:51,959
We open it up via Survey Monkey.

67
00:01:51,999 --> 00:01:54,999
We made a mistake the first year and did voting.

68
00:01:55,542 --> 00:01:57,334
Did you try my glasses on?

69
00:01:57,751 --> 00:01:58,999
Mess you up?

70
00:01:58,999 --> 00:01:59,999
You're blind.

71
00:01:59,999 --> 00:02:00,999
RUSS: And deaf.

72
00:02:00,999 --> 00:02:01,999
This should be fun.

73
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:05,167
We tried to take the votes on Survey Monkey

74
00:02:05,167 --> 00:02:08,626
as well and hackers do an amazing job of screwing

75
00:02:08,626 --> 00:02:10,959
with your numbers.

76
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:13,959
So we do it a little differently now.

77
00:02:13,959 --> 00:02:16,999
Jericho bought a sound meter and we are going to do it here.

78
00:02:16,999 --> 00:02:18,083
You can actually vote.

79
00:02:18,083 --> 00:02:20,834
If you happen to be one of the nominees and you're

80
00:02:20,834 --> 00:02:24,709
in the room and you win something and you want a shot, or five,

81
00:02:24,709 --> 00:02:27,334
these bottles are unopened.

82
00:02:27,334 --> 00:02:29,792
You can crack the seal yourself if you want.

83
00:02:29,792 --> 00:02:34,250
I figured nobody will trust an already-opened bot at DEF CON.

84
00:02:37,626 --> 00:02:39,792
There is a board review.

85
00:02:39,876 --> 00:02:40,959
It goes out.

86
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:42,999
Everyone nominates everyone they want.

87
00:02:42,999 --> 00:02:45,083
Jericho and I will sit down and decide which one

88
00:02:45,083 --> 00:02:49,334
is the most relevant, which ones got the most votes and which ones are just

89
00:02:49,334 --> 00:02:50,999
trolling us.

90
00:02:51,083 --> 00:02:53,292
We will remove the trolls and bring you

91
00:02:53,292 --> 00:02:57,459
the absolute distilled best and the voting is done right here

92
00:02:57,459 --> 00:03:00,834
with the sound meter, like I said.

93
00:03:02,417 --> 00:03:06,834
Past years, we started this in 2011.

94
00:03:06,834 --> 00:03:09,250
It was a brain child that has been slow to give birth simply

95
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:12,834
because people would rather be drinking and hacking and breaking

96
00:03:12,834 --> 00:03:15,334
into stuff than sitting in here watching Jericho

97
00:03:15,334 --> 00:03:17,542
and I talk about this.

98
00:03:17,999 --> 00:03:20,999
It was originally called the DEF CON Awards which was

99
00:03:20,999 --> 00:03:24,542
slightly confusing since the closing ceremonies became

100
00:03:24,542 --> 00:03:26,834
the DEF CON Awards.

101
00:03:26,834 --> 00:03:28,999
At some point we started taking three and a half hours

102
00:03:28,999 --> 00:03:31,334
to close this conference down.

103
00:03:31,334 --> 00:03:33,417
We renamed it to DEF CON Recognize Awards

104
00:03:33,417 --> 00:03:35,459
because we are trying to recognize people

105
00:03:35,459 --> 00:03:37,999
for being douchebags or awesome.

106
00:03:38,083 --> 00:03:39,709
Hi, Paul.

107
00:03:40,999 --> 00:03:46,459
Last two years was held on Sunday and anything held on Sunday

108
00:03:46,459 --> 00:03:50,918
after partying on Friday and Saturday isn't going

109
00:03:50,918 --> 00:03:52,792
to happen.

110
00:03:52,792 --> 00:03:54,918
We had a dozen people in the last couple

111
00:03:54,918 --> 00:03:59,959
of years and Brian and I started drinking a lot on our own.

112
00:04:00,209 --> 00:04:01,999
This year we moved it to Saturday.

113
00:04:04,834 --> 00:04:06,209
We're all awake.

114
00:04:08,667 --> 00:04:11,584
Not sober but awake.

115
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:13,667
RUSS: Okay, DEF CON 19, 2011.

116
00:04:13,667 --> 00:04:15,999
We had worst media conference, best privacy technology,

117
00:04:15,999 --> 00:04:20,334
best open source software response to an attack or method, best author

118
00:04:20,334 --> 00:04:23,999
or story that captures the hacker mind set and then we had

119
00:04:23,999 --> 00:04:27,083
the Security Charlatan of the Year.

120
00:04:27,083 --> 00:04:30,999
As you know, Jericho may not know if you don't know it's sad,

121
00:04:30,999 --> 00:04:33,999
but Jericho does a blog and he does a lot

122
00:04:33,999 --> 00:04:37,584
of research and write-ups on potential charlatans

123
00:04:37,584 --> 00:04:40,459
in the security community.

124
00:04:40,459 --> 00:04:42,876
He's actually got a very big response.

125
00:04:42,876 --> 00:04:46,250
We get input from the industry, around the world that point people

126
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:50,334
out who are doing a great job of trying to be something that

127
00:04:50,334 --> 00:04:52,167
they are not.

128
00:04:52,334 --> 00:04:54,999
And so that's, that was really one of the main premises

129
00:04:54,999 --> 00:04:57,834
of the awards was trying to get that information

130
00:04:57,834 --> 00:05:01,542
out so everyone would know who they could trust.

131
00:05:01,542 --> 00:05:03,250
And these were the winners.

132
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:04,834
So you know, we had king pin, the story

133
00:05:04,834 --> 00:05:08,834
by Kevin Poulsen who won the best author and story.

134
00:05:08,999 --> 00:05:10,834
We had Gregory Evans, if any of you remember him

135
00:05:10,834 --> 00:05:12,876
from a couple years ago, because he's still

136
00:05:12,876 --> 00:05:15,834
around for Security Charlatan of the year.

137
00:05:15,834 --> 00:05:19,417
Oddly, every year we've done this, nobody who has won a you're

138
00:05:19,417 --> 00:05:24,375
a piece of shit award has come up an collected their award.

139
00:05:24,792 --> 00:05:27,999
What we've done with those in the past is just Jericho has taken

140
00:05:27,999 --> 00:05:31,626
those occupant and auctioned them off and collected the money,

141
00:05:31,626 --> 00:05:33,542
given it to EFF.

142
00:05:33,542 --> 00:05:34,542
Right?

143
00:05:34,542 --> 00:05:35,626
I think that's right.

144
00:05:35,626 --> 00:05:36,999
JERICHO: Or HFC.

145
00:05:36,999 --> 00:05:38,501
RUSS: Or hackers for charity.

146
00:05:38,709 --> 00:05:41,999
If a douchebag wins it, we take the award out and auction it

147
00:05:41,999 --> 00:05:45,584
off and give the money to somebody who needs it.

148
00:05:45,584 --> 00:05:48,834
That was the year we got trophies.

149
00:05:48,834 --> 00:05:50,709
This year you get inebriated.

150
00:05:53,959 --> 00:06:01,125
DEF CON 20, last year, our categories, worst media person or outlet.

151
00:06:01,125 --> 00:06:02,626
This was for print.

152
00:06:02,626 --> 00:06:03,918
We separated out the media that year

153
00:06:03,918 --> 00:06:05,959
and it was a mess.

154
00:06:05,999 --> 00:06:09,584
So we had worst media person or outlet for broadcast where we had no

155
00:06:09,584 --> 00:06:11,751
nominations at all.

156
00:06:11,751 --> 00:06:13,999
You all love fox news apparently.

157
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:17,334
I got two laughs from that.

158
00:06:17,334 --> 00:06:19,667
Everyone else is like: What is a television?

159
00:06:19,999 --> 00:06:23,626
Best privacy enhancing technology, tour one,

160
00:06:23,626 --> 00:06:28,542
sec best SEC or non-hack Twitter feed, non-news.

161
00:06:29,876 --> 00:06:32,999
We renamed the next award.

162
00:06:32,999 --> 00:06:36,792
This was -- no offense was intended by this originally.

163
00:06:36,876 --> 00:06:39,125
This was more of a European thing or we were calling somebody

164
00:06:39,125 --> 00:06:40,834
a ding dong.

165
00:06:40,999 --> 00:06:44,250
But we've renamed this award this year to the Nit-Twit.

166
00:06:44,999 --> 00:06:49,083
We have a captain obvious award for last year that general Alexander won

167
00:06:49,083 --> 00:06:53,459
and oddly here we are a year later and it has been proven.

168
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:56,626
We have the Security Charlatan of the year

169
00:06:56,626 --> 00:06:59,292
for last year was Ankit Fadia.

170
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:04,751
I will hand it off to Jericho to do what he does best and I'll make fun

171
00:07:04,751 --> 00:07:09,083
and hell he will him as he goes through the categories.

172
00:07:09,375 --> 00:07:10,999
This is interactive.

173
00:07:10,999 --> 00:07:12,167
Be involved.

174
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:15,999
If you are in the room and want to wash away the pain or share

175
00:07:15,999 --> 00:07:20,751
in the victory, please come up and have a shot or two.

176
00:07:22,999 --> 00:07:25,375
JERICHO: Heckle him.

177
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:29,999
Best Media Coverage.

178
00:07:29,999 --> 00:07:31,959
This time we went back to any media.

179
00:07:31,959 --> 00:07:35,542
Best Privacy Enhancing Tech since DEF CON 20.

180
00:07:35,542 --> 00:07:40,626
A lot of these categories we're not looking for the best in the world ever.

181
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:42,334
And some of the nominations we had to rule out because they were

182
00:07:42,334 --> 00:07:45,083
a lot older than some of you in the room.

183
00:07:45,459 --> 00:07:49,250
Worst Privacy Enhancing Tech, Best Security or Hacker Feed.

184
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:50,876
Now the Nit-Twit award.

185
00:07:50,876 --> 00:07:54,292
Best DEF CON group project that was approved.

186
00:07:54,292 --> 00:07:57,709
That was an interesting -- we'll get to that, sorry.

187
00:07:57,709 --> 00:07:58,792
Worst or Most Meaningless

188
00:07:58,792 --> 00:08:00,959
Security Buzzword.

189
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:02,834
I'm sure we all know some of those.

190
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:06,709
Biggest Law Enforcement Blunder since DEF CON 20 once again, and

191
00:08:06,709 --> 00:08:09,999
the Security Charlatan of the Year.

192
00:08:11,918 --> 00:08:14,751
So we will start out with Best Media Coverage.

193
00:08:14,751 --> 00:08:17,918
This is the only one where we get to have some good visuals.

194
00:08:18,083 --> 00:08:19,792
Quite a few nominations.

195
00:08:19,792 --> 00:08:23,999
By the way the slides for this will be up on attrition.org next week.

196
00:08:24,083 --> 00:08:26,083
It has the full list of nominations down in the notes

197
00:08:26,083 --> 00:08:28,999
below that you can't see on the screen.

198
00:08:28,999 --> 00:08:31,125
So you can look at our work and see which ones we decided

199
00:08:31,125 --> 00:08:34,542
to pick out of the list and put up, and all that.

200
00:08:34,542 --> 00:08:36,125
And call us out for it if you want.

201
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:41,876
Brian Krebs, Glen Greenwald, Register Security Week, RT.com

202
00:08:41,876 --> 00:08:44,083
and Kevin Poulsen.

203
00:08:44,375 --> 00:08:45,999
Actually that's the Worst Media Coverage that we get

204
00:08:45,999 --> 00:08:47,999
the good individuals, not these one.

205
00:08:48,999 --> 00:08:51,792
Are these names new to anyone?

206
00:08:51,792 --> 00:08:55,999
(Speaker away from microphone.)    AUDIENCE: No!

207
00:08:55,999 --> 00:08:58,167
JERICHO: Thank you!

208
00:09:00,083 --> 00:09:01,375
Okay.

209
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:05,417
So based on that, see if I can make this damn thing work.

210
00:09:06,584 --> 00:09:07,999
Testing!

211
00:09:08,501 --> 00:09:10,125
It's probably good.

212
00:09:10,125 --> 00:09:11,751
So one at a time.

213
00:09:11,959 --> 00:09:14,334
Based on their work in the past year or so which

214
00:09:14,334 --> 00:09:18,250
of these people do you think deserve the award?

215
00:09:18,292 --> 00:09:19,876
Brian Krebs?

216
00:09:25,626 --> 00:09:28,999
(Applause and cheers.)    JERICHO: You writing

217
00:09:28,999 --> 00:09:30,876
this down?

218
00:09:30,876 --> 00:09:31,999
Make sure you can see it.

219
00:09:31,999 --> 00:09:32,999
83.2?

220
00:09:33,667 --> 00:09:35,375
That was pretty loud.

221
00:09:35,709 --> 00:09:40,417
How about Glen Greenwald and from the Guardian.co.uk?

222
00:09:46,292 --> 00:09:50,167
(Cheers and applause.)    JERICHO: He can see, it's cool.

223
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:54,876
AUDIENCE: He can't hear.

224
00:09:54,876 --> 00:09:55,918
JERICHO: What?

225
00:09:55,918 --> 00:09:56,918
RUSS: What?

226
00:09:56,918 --> 00:09:58,083
JERICHO: The Reg.

227
00:10:04,542 --> 00:10:07,542
(Applause and cheers.)    RUSS: It didn't register at all.

228
00:10:07,542 --> 00:10:09,501
JERICHO: Registered the same as me.

229
00:10:09,667 --> 00:10:12,834
One thing I'll give them, they usually have fun titles

230
00:10:12,834 --> 00:10:15,000
for all their articles.

231
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,167
Even if the article is kind of limp, the title is usually good.

232
00:10:18,167 --> 00:10:22,918
AUDIENCE: That was the unverified single --    JERICHO:

233
00:10:22,918 --> 00:10:28,792
Masters of the unverified single source news story.

234
00:10:31,876 --> 00:10:34,584
(Chuckles.)    JERICHO: How about Security Week?

235
00:10:39,459 --> 00:10:44,209
(Chuckles.)    JERICHO: Apparently it was a little less loud on that one.

236
00:10:44,209 --> 00:10:46,501
It didn't even register as much as the last.

237
00:10:49,876 --> 00:10:53,751
RT.com, specifically for their Snowden coverage.

238
00:11:02,083 --> 00:11:04,250
(Cheers and applause.)    JERICHO: Last we

239
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:07,083
have some guy named Kevin Poulsen.

240
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:09,292
I think he has been on the scene a year or two.

241
00:11:09,999 --> 00:11:12,626
Yeah, he probably did some time.

242
00:11:12,626 --> 00:11:13,626
I don't know.

243
00:11:13,626 --> 00:11:15,584
His work at wired and this one was actually

244
00:11:15,584 --> 00:11:20,083
submitted by the guy that just told you we didn't vote.

245
00:11:20,083 --> 00:11:21,792
Anyway, yeah.

246
00:11:21,792 --> 00:11:22,876
Someone has to drink.

247
00:11:22,876 --> 00:11:25,083
So anyway, Kevin Poulsen.

248
00:11:28,999 --> 00:11:33,459
(Some applause.)    JERICHO: Weasel, you didn't clap very loud.

249
00:11:36,999 --> 00:11:44,667
Based on that, RT.com.

250
00:11:44,792 --> 00:11:45,999
Yea!

251
00:11:45,999 --> 00:11:47,709
Is there anyone here from RT.com?

252
00:11:47,709 --> 00:11:51,667
(There is no response.)    He's like not me.

253
00:11:51,667 --> 00:11:53,626
JERICHO: He runs up with the camera.

254
00:11:53,626 --> 00:11:54,626
Come on!

255
00:11:54,918 --> 00:11:56,959
I have to assume you're with RT.com now.

256
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:57,999
You have to take a shot.

257
00:11:58,542 --> 00:12:02,334
For the next five minutes you're with RT.com if you would like a shot.

258
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:07,959
(Cheers and applause.)    JERICHO: And you

259
00:12:07,959 --> 00:12:10,334
can take a picture if you take a shot.

260
00:12:13,999 --> 00:12:17,709
While he's figuring out the tamper-proof seal over there,

261
00:12:17,709 --> 00:12:21,876
we'll go to the worst media coverage of hackers.

262
00:12:21,876 --> 00:12:23,751
This is where we have fun visuals.

263
00:12:23,876 --> 00:12:29,999
The nominees are from ReadWrite, their article titled "World War III."

264
00:12:30,292 --> 00:12:32,501
We'll go one at a time.

265
00:12:32,501 --> 00:12:33,501
There we go.

266
00:12:33,834 --> 00:12:36,542
That's the visual we got with the article.

267
00:12:36,542 --> 00:12:39,375
If you want to take a minute to read the top paragraph?

268
00:12:43,375 --> 00:12:46,999
Every day the pentagon is attacked 3 million times.

269
00:12:46,999 --> 00:12:50,209
That's amusing because weasel, was that 95 or 96 we got

270
00:12:50,209 --> 00:12:53,751
the article about the pentagon being attacked

271
00:12:53,751 --> 00:12:55,834
250,000 times?

272
00:12:56,999 --> 00:12:59,751
Yeah, because they were counting ping.

273
00:13:00,459 --> 00:13:02,999
So anyway, we have that good visual that World

274
00:13:02,999 --> 00:13:05,999
War III is here and we are losing.

275
00:13:05,999 --> 00:13:07,834
I said you get a shot.

276
00:13:08,751 --> 00:13:10,709
Oh, yeah, solidarity.

277
00:13:17,999 --> 00:13:19,999
(Cheers and applause.)    JERICHO: I'm good

278
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:21,667
at something!

279
00:13:22,751 --> 00:13:26,834
Next up we have Marie Claire, "When Geeks Attack."

280
00:13:26,834 --> 00:13:29,083
So look at that picture.

281
00:13:29,083 --> 00:13:31,501
Those are apparently Brogrammers.

282
00:13:31,792 --> 00:13:35,209
(Laughter.)    JERICHO: Can anyone tell the difference between that

283
00:13:35,209 --> 00:13:37,459
and a DEF CON crowd?

284
00:13:42,292 --> 00:13:45,792
There's females in that picture and there's no females at DEF CON.

285
00:13:45,792 --> 00:13:46,999
Yeah, good call!

286
00:13:47,292 --> 00:13:50,459
You want to take a sip so you're more coherent?

287
00:13:52,334 --> 00:13:54,709
Next we have Meet The Press.

288
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:58,626
This douchebag, David Gregory, basically says: "Mr. Greenwald,

289
00:13:58,626 --> 00:14:02,292
shouldn't we be charging you with a crime for doing your job

290
00:14:02,292 --> 00:14:04,751
as a journalist and covering a story?"

291
00:14:04,751 --> 00:14:07,083
He actually grills them.

292
00:14:07,083 --> 00:14:09,083
It was embarrassing for Gregory.

293
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:12,918
Man, I failed.

294
00:14:12,918 --> 00:14:14,999
I didn't even put the YouTube link in there.

295
00:14:14,999 --> 00:14:16,876
You have to Google it or something.

296
00:14:16,876 --> 00:14:17,876
I don't know.

297
00:14:17,876 --> 00:14:19,667
Next, the Manici?

298
00:14:21,876 --> 00:14:23,083
Okay, yeah.

299
00:14:23,709 --> 00:14:24,709
NPA.

300
00:14:24,709 --> 00:14:26,834
So there's a little back story to this one.

301
00:14:26,834 --> 00:14:30,083
Yeah, basically they write an article and they didn't quite use

302
00:14:30,083 --> 00:14:32,083
the best wording.

303
00:14:32,083 --> 00:14:34,999
So everyone thought that what they said was that the law was going

304
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:38,459
to do something and it ends up they didn't.

305
00:14:38,667 --> 00:14:41,751
By the time they issued the retraction or apology,

306
00:14:41,751 --> 00:14:44,417
everyone was in a panic.

307
00:14:44,417 --> 00:14:46,999
Yeah, they really screwed the pooch on that one.

308
00:14:47,459 --> 00:14:51,834
Next we have Info World, "Confessions Of A Cyber Warrior."

309
00:14:52,083 --> 00:14:53,918
This is a very recent one.

310
00:14:54,167 --> 00:14:55,167
Yeah?

311
00:14:55,167 --> 00:14:56,959
Who actually read this article?

312
00:14:58,501 --> 00:15:02,709
Who read this article and kept a straight face?

313
00:15:02,834 --> 00:15:04,250
Liar!

314
00:15:06,125 --> 00:15:07,709
Okay, yeah.

315
00:15:07,709 --> 00:15:10,876
If you want a good, good laugh grab a bottle,

316
00:15:10,876 --> 00:15:13,292
read this article.

317
00:15:13,292 --> 00:15:14,334
It's a laugh.

318
00:15:14,999 --> 00:15:16,334
What?

319
00:15:20,083 --> 00:15:26,999
We are going to vote now.

320
00:15:27,542 --> 00:15:29,999
This time make noise, bitches.

321
00:15:31,375 --> 00:15:33,667
ReadWrite, "World War III."

322
00:15:35,999 --> 00:15:39,876
(Cheers and applause.)    JERICHO: Oh, shit,

323
00:15:39,876 --> 00:15:43,083
got triple digits on that.

324
00:15:46,083 --> 00:15:48,542
Marie Claire, "When Geeks Attack."

325
00:15:53,417 --> 00:15:59,999
(Cheers and applause.)    RUSS: It's close, close.

326
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:02,083
JERICHO: Good are effort.

327
00:16:02,918 --> 00:16:05,167
Meet The Press, David Gregory?

328
00:16:05,667 --> 00:16:12,876
(Cheers and applause.)    RUSS: These two guys are still louder.

329
00:16:12,876 --> 00:16:14,334
JERICHO: This is revealing.

330
00:16:14,334 --> 00:16:16,999
Stack the vote!

331
00:16:16,999 --> 00:16:19,292
JERICHO: If any of you ...

332
00:16:19,292 --> 00:16:24,083
(Audience calling out.)    JERICHO: If any of you want to vote, come

333
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:27,459
up and have more influence.

334
00:16:27,459 --> 00:16:28,667
That's how this works.

335
00:16:28,876 --> 00:16:30,167
The only reason someone is not stacking the vote

336
00:16:30,167 --> 00:16:32,999
is because he actually forgot his air horn.

337
00:16:37,083 --> 00:16:38,999
(Laughter.)    AUDIENCE: (Speaker away

338
00:16:38,999 --> 00:16:41,751
from microphone.)    JERICHO: By who?

339
00:16:41,751 --> 00:16:42,834
Cite your source!

340
00:16:44,792 --> 00:16:47,999
Okay, the Manici and "The Correction" ?

341
00:16:48,999 --> 00:16:50,709
Wah-wah-wah.

342
00:16:51,709 --> 00:16:55,999
JERICHO: Yeah, that was limp.

343
00:16:56,501 --> 00:16:59,459
Info World, "Confessions of a Cyber Warrior."

344
00:16:59,792 --> 00:17:05,999
(Cheers and applause.)    RUSS: That's not bad from the back of the room.

345
00:17:05,999 --> 00:17:06,167
JERICHO: Who is that making most

346
00:17:06,167 --> 00:17:07,999
of the noise back there?

347
00:17:09,292 --> 00:17:11,209
Come on, one of you raise your hands.

348
00:17:11,209 --> 00:17:12,999
Who made all the noise back there?

349
00:17:15,501 --> 00:17:17,834
The harbor seal back there?

350
00:17:26,334 --> 00:17:28,584
(Speaker away from microphone.)    JERICHO: The

351
00:17:28,584 --> 00:17:30,667
winner, thanks to these two fine gentlemen is,

352
00:17:30,667 --> 00:17:33,999
ReadWrite and "World War III," which we are losing.

353
00:17:33,999 --> 00:17:35,083
It's in print.

354
00:17:35,083 --> 00:17:36,250
It's fact.

355
00:17:37,083 --> 00:17:42,417
Yeah, so best -- did I skip one?

356
00:17:42,417 --> 00:17:45,459
Best Privacy-Enhancing Technology since DEF CON 20.

357
00:17:45,501 --> 00:17:51,083
We actually had, I think we had more than that.

358
00:17:51,083 --> 00:17:53,626
A lot of nominations but only four of them count.

359
00:17:53,751 --> 00:17:55,125
So Ghostery.

360
00:17:55,125 --> 00:17:56,167
Anyone use that?

361
00:17:57,751 --> 00:17:59,250
One user?

362
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:00,417
You better be loud.

363
00:18:00,459 --> 00:18:02,501
Disconnect 2?

364
00:18:02,626 --> 00:18:03,751
Any users?

365
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:08,792
Does anyone here care about privacy?

366
00:18:08,999 --> 00:18:10,167
No?

367
00:18:10,667 --> 00:18:11,667
Okay.

368
00:18:12,999 --> 00:18:15,709
Twitter 2 user authentication?

369
00:18:15,709 --> 00:18:17,083
Anyone use that on Twitter?

370
00:18:18,125 --> 00:18:19,876
Two people?

371
00:18:19,876 --> 00:18:22,334
And we wouldn't want to hack your accounts anyway?

372
00:18:22,334 --> 00:18:23,334
We doubled it.

373
00:18:23,334 --> 00:18:27,751
We doubled from the previous category.

374
00:18:27,751 --> 00:18:28,999
You went from one to two.

375
00:18:28,999 --> 00:18:30,626
JERICHO: And who uses onion Pi?

376
00:18:30,626 --> 00:18:35,125
This is completely random now.

377
00:18:35,334 --> 00:18:38,959
JERICHO: The NSA thanks all of you.

378
00:18:41,876 --> 00:18:45,501
Just as a note, we want to point out that the reason

379
00:18:45,501 --> 00:18:49,999
the other products did not make it on the list, they are not recent

380
00:18:49,999 --> 00:18:52,626
or new since DEF CON 20.

381
00:18:52,999 --> 00:18:54,459
That's really the key.

382
00:18:54,459 --> 00:18:59,250
We need things that are new over the last 12 or 14 months.

383
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:01,209
JERICHO: Russ, use the microphone.

384
00:19:01,209 --> 00:19:02,334
RUSS: It isn't on.

385
00:19:02,334 --> 00:19:03,417
JERICHO: It is now.

386
00:19:03,751 --> 00:19:06,584
RUSS: What he said.

387
00:19:06,584 --> 00:19:08,999
JERICHO: Thank you.

388
00:19:08,999 --> 00:19:12,292
Anyway, yeah, since DEF CON 20, thank you esteemed hat.

389
00:19:12,501 --> 00:19:14,999
So Ghostery.

390
00:19:15,083 --> 00:19:16,959
Boo!

391
00:19:16,999 --> 00:19:19,334
JERICHO: This is going to be fun.

392
00:19:19,417 --> 00:19:22,459
None of you people know what any of this shit does.

393
00:19:22,459 --> 00:19:25,125
RUSS: And they don't care.

394
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:27,292
(Laughter.)    JERICHO: See, next time you need

395
00:19:27,292 --> 00:19:30,834
to nominate whatever crappy tool you're using for privacy, paper

396
00:19:30,834 --> 00:19:32,999
and pencil or something?

397
00:19:32,999 --> 00:19:34,417
RUSS: Microsoft Word.

398
00:19:34,417 --> 00:19:37,999
JERICHO: I hear that zip encryption is pretty strong.

399
00:19:41,959 --> 00:19:47,999
(Laughter.)    (Speaker away from microphone.)    JERICHO: I

400
00:19:47,999 --> 00:19:49,999
love JSON.

401
00:19:49,999 --> 00:19:51,959
Disconnect 2?

402
00:19:58,999 --> 00:20:03,501
(Loud cheer.)    AUDIENCE: Yeah!

403
00:20:03,501 --> 00:20:04,501
Et cetera!

404
00:20:04,501 --> 00:20:07,292
JERICHO: Disconnect 2 is hot shit based on that vote.

405
00:20:11,626 --> 00:20:14,667
Twitter two factor authentication.

406
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:19,292
Come on, two of you!

407
00:20:19,292 --> 00:20:21,667
I don't know of that little U.K.

408
00:20:21,751 --> 00:20:23,292
golf clap.

409
00:20:23,334 --> 00:20:25,584
(Some cheering and applause.)    RUSS: They had

410
00:20:25,584 --> 00:20:29,959
the most supporters in the room and they are not winning.

411
00:20:29,959 --> 00:20:30,999
They are getting ready.

412
00:20:30,999 --> 00:20:34,959
JERICHO: Onion Pi!

413
00:20:38,209 --> 00:20:41,626
(Loud cheer and yelling.)    JERICHO: That was

414
00:20:41,626 --> 00:20:45,083
a noble effort, wild charging bear.

415
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,999
(Laughter.)    RUSS: That's officially the highest number we have ever seen

416
00:20:51,999 --> 00:20:53,667
in three years.

417
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:59,876
(Laughter.)    JERICHO: Now, which of you critics was all bitching

418
00:20:59,876 --> 00:21:05,167
and whining like a whore about the unscientific process we use?

419
00:21:06,999 --> 00:21:09,250
I heard it from right here, hmm?

420
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:15,918
Very scientific but not particularly relevant.

421
00:21:15,918 --> 00:21:18,250
JERICHO: Neither is the rest of our industry.

422
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:20,667
RUSS: And we alcohol.

423
00:21:20,876 --> 00:21:23,999
JERICHO: Anyway, we give you people many ways

424
00:21:23,999 --> 00:21:26,334
to influence this.

425
00:21:26,334 --> 00:21:27,999
We use Survey Monkey.

426
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:32,626
We let you come here and make noise, run up, fellate the damn thing

427
00:21:32,626 --> 00:21:34,417
if you want.

428
00:21:35,709 --> 00:21:38,083
If you want someone to win, next year you have some

429
00:21:38,083 --> 00:21:39,834
good guidance.

430
00:21:41,125 --> 00:21:42,667
Air horn.

431
00:21:43,417 --> 00:21:44,999
The winner on that one was onion Pi

432
00:21:44,999 --> 00:21:47,876
because of the esteemed gentleman down here.

433
00:21:47,999 --> 00:21:51,999
Since you are obviously users, you need to come up here and partake.

434
00:21:52,751 --> 00:21:55,167
Designated drinker, two shots.

435
00:21:55,999 --> 00:21:57,209
Good man!

436
00:21:59,999 --> 00:22:04,542
Worst Privacy-Enhancing Technology since DEF CON 20.

437
00:22:04,542 --> 00:22:05,542
RUSS: Oh, God.

438
00:22:05,542 --> 00:22:11,375
JERICHO: Newly disclosed.

439
00:22:12,292 --> 00:22:14,999
RUSS: Newly disclosed.

440
00:22:14,999 --> 00:22:18,751
It may be old but it has a new name.

441
00:22:19,209 --> 00:22:21,999
JERICHO: It has a fancy new Power Point, I hear.

442
00:22:24,334 --> 00:22:25,999
Prism?

443
00:22:25,999 --> 00:22:27,542
Anyone heard of Prism?

444
00:22:27,542 --> 00:22:28,918
Yeah, good stuff.

445
00:22:28,918 --> 00:22:33,584
(Applause.)    JERICHO: Cypher Cloud.

446
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:42,999
Bogus security claims, abusing DMCA as a defense.

447
00:22:42,999 --> 00:22:44,876
That's interesting.

448
00:22:44,876 --> 00:22:46,334
I'll have to look into this one.

449
00:22:46,334 --> 00:22:47,334
Gmail.

450
00:22:47,334 --> 00:22:48,334
No reason given.

451
00:22:48,334 --> 00:22:51,417
(Cheers and applause.)    RUSS: I thought that

452
00:22:51,417 --> 00:22:53,292
was Prism.

453
00:22:53,584 --> 00:22:56,083
JERICHO: Prism light?

454
00:22:57,501 --> 00:23:01,542
And last one is WiFi Sugar, "Proof is in the Website," which I haven't

455
00:23:01,542 --> 00:23:03,167
read either.

456
00:23:03,167 --> 00:23:05,083
Anyone used WiFi Sugar?

457
00:23:05,501 --> 00:23:07,626
Any WiFi Sugar developers?

458
00:23:07,959 --> 00:23:08,999
Get a better name.

459
00:23:08,999 --> 00:23:09,999
Thank you.

460
00:23:09,999 --> 00:23:10,999
No.

461
00:23:10,999 --> 00:23:11,999
RUSS: WiFi Sugar.

462
00:23:11,999 --> 00:23:15,250
JERICHO: And get me some WiFi Sugar.

463
00:23:17,876 --> 00:23:20,876
I can see a bad SNL skit off of that.

464
00:23:22,709 --> 00:23:23,999
Okay.

465
00:23:23,999 --> 00:23:28,083
So --    RUSS: Can you move to the other side of the stage?

466
00:23:28,083 --> 00:23:29,125
JERICHO: Prism?

467
00:23:29,125 --> 00:23:32,626
RUSS: Go for Prism.

468
00:23:32,667 --> 00:23:35,751
JERICHO: No, no, rules say you have to have it.

469
00:23:40,876 --> 00:23:44,417
(Loud cheer.)    JERICHO: That was ten less than you two actually making

470
00:23:44,417 --> 00:23:46,292
noise on your own.

471
00:23:50,542 --> 00:23:51,834
Sir?

472
00:23:51,999 --> 00:23:53,375
Sirs?

473
00:23:53,626 --> 00:23:55,751
The failed panel was a few hours ago.

474
00:23:55,876 --> 00:23:58,501
RUSS: Oh, buddy.

475
00:23:58,834 --> 00:23:59,918
Yeah, I got it.

476
00:23:59,918 --> 00:24:01,459
JERICHO: Cypher Cloud.

477
00:24:05,918 --> 00:24:09,501
If I can't be loud, I'll make the other fuckers be quiet.

478
00:24:09,667 --> 00:24:13,999
RUSS: It doesn't go backwards, people.

479
00:24:15,999 --> 00:24:17,999
JERICHO: Okay.

480
00:24:17,999 --> 00:24:18,999
Gmail.

481
00:24:18,999 --> 00:24:24,959
(Cheers and applause.)    RUSS: I actually think

482
00:24:24,959 --> 00:24:34,626
that was the most popular and it was actually quite nice.

483
00:24:34,918 --> 00:24:37,542
JERICHO: That was pretty swell.

484
00:24:37,542 --> 00:24:38,542
I think we will discount these fuckers

485
00:24:38,542 --> 00:24:40,709
down here in favor of that.

486
00:24:41,542 --> 00:24:43,292
Use the microphone.

487
00:24:43,292 --> 00:24:45,709
RUSS: If you want to keep Prism --    JERICHO: If you

488
00:24:45,709 --> 00:24:49,999
brought your own microphone that would be a different story.

489
00:24:49,999 --> 00:24:52,250
RUSS: Unlike your style.

490
00:24:53,999 --> 00:24:56,792
JERICHO: Yeah, about ten less?

491
00:24:56,999 --> 00:24:59,083
Last, WiFi sugar.

492
00:24:59,334 --> 00:25:02,834
RUSS: Remember, it doesn't go backwards.

493
00:25:02,999 --> 00:25:04,083
Hey, somebody -- (One applauding.)    RUSS: That's

494
00:25:04,083 --> 00:25:06,167
the lowest number we have today.

495
00:25:08,626 --> 00:25:10,501
We have two.

496
00:25:10,918 --> 00:25:14,626
We have Prism -- don't be quiet.

497
00:25:14,959 --> 00:25:18,876
And we have Gmail and we had more energy on Gmail.

498
00:25:19,083 --> 00:25:24,542
So if you want to vote for Prism, use your voice right now.

499
00:25:30,501 --> 00:25:34,334
(Loud shouting and applause.)    RUSS: That's nice.

500
00:25:34,375 --> 00:25:35,999
All right.

501
00:25:36,083 --> 00:25:37,584
Gmail, go!

502
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:42,250
(Loud shouting, cheering and applause.)    RUSS: I think you

503
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:44,584
went backwards.

504
00:25:44,834 --> 00:25:45,834
Yeah.

505
00:25:45,834 --> 00:25:50,167
You didn't even meet your previous one.

506
00:25:50,167 --> 00:25:51,167
JERICHO: 90.3.

507
00:25:51,167 --> 00:25:54,584
RUSS: So it's Prism.

508
00:25:54,584 --> 00:25:57,876
JERICHO: Is General Alexander in the room to take this award?

509
00:25:58,459 --> 00:26:00,250
Shot, General!

510
00:26:00,292 --> 00:26:03,292
(Speaker away from microphone.)    RUSS: We didn't

511
00:26:03,292 --> 00:26:06,584
have to ask that question earlier.

512
00:26:06,584 --> 00:26:07,584
They knew.

513
00:26:07,584 --> 00:26:09,751
JERICHO: Any feds?

514
00:26:09,751 --> 00:26:14,167
I heard after his Black Hat talk went swimmingly when people were calling

515
00:26:14,167 --> 00:26:17,083
out bullshit to interrupt him?

516
00:26:17,167 --> 00:26:19,584
That he beelined straight to McCarran.

517
00:26:19,876 --> 00:26:23,542
RUSS: That was planned before his talk.

518
00:26:23,542 --> 00:26:25,792
JERICHO: No, the eggs got confiscated

519
00:26:25,792 --> 00:26:28,999
before they got to the room.

520
00:26:29,999 --> 00:26:31,501
That happened.

521
00:26:32,542 --> 00:26:35,751
RUSS: I paid a lot of money for those eggs.

522
00:26:35,751 --> 00:26:40,167
JERICHO: Now we are getting into the fun stuff.

523
00:26:40,167 --> 00:26:42,083
RUSS: You didn't tell them who won?

524
00:26:42,083 --> 00:26:43,083
JERICHO: Prism.

525
00:26:44,167 --> 00:26:46,501
Don't worry, they know they won.

526
00:26:46,501 --> 00:26:48,083
Where do you think this goes?

527
00:26:49,501 --> 00:26:51,292
Best Twitter Feed.

528
00:26:51,709 --> 00:26:53,792
IO Air.

529
00:26:53,792 --> 00:26:55,709
Make noise if you follow these people.

530
00:26:55,709 --> 00:26:59,999
(Applause.)    JERICHO: Moxie.

531
00:27:02,292 --> 00:27:03,999
Your Anon News.

532
00:27:05,999 --> 00:27:07,584
Space Rogue.

533
00:27:07,999 --> 00:27:10,959
(Applause and cheers.)    JERICHO: You want

534
00:27:10,959 --> 00:27:14,542
them to make noise on the next ...

535
00:27:15,417 --> 00:27:19,417
RUSS: You know, it's really hard.

536
00:27:19,417 --> 00:27:21,792
I just recognized him without the blue hair.

537
00:27:21,792 --> 00:27:23,751
JERICHO: I'm sorry.

538
00:27:23,751 --> 00:27:25,083
RUSS: I'm sorry, dude.

539
00:27:25,083 --> 00:27:26,667
I haven't seen you in forever.

540
00:27:26,959 --> 00:27:28,999
I apologize.

541
00:27:28,999 --> 00:27:31,999
I'm sitting up here going: Oh, who's the guy with the beard?

542
00:27:31,999 --> 00:27:33,334
JERICHO: I was going to say you're sporting

543
00:27:33,334 --> 00:27:36,083
the post office poster beard.

544
00:27:36,751 --> 00:27:38,751
Have you seen me?

545
00:27:38,751 --> 00:27:41,125
$20,000 reward.

546
00:27:41,125 --> 00:27:43,334
RUSS: Good to see you, sir.

547
00:27:43,918 --> 00:27:47,501
JERICHO: This is the one time I had moderator

548
00:27:47,501 --> 00:27:51,626
influence, the Hacker News was nominated.

549
00:27:52,501 --> 00:27:55,918
They are plagiarists; they are not going to win.

550
00:27:55,918 --> 00:27:56,918
Sorry.

551
00:27:56,999 --> 00:27:58,751
Hacker Huntress.

552
00:28:00,834 --> 00:28:03,626
(Cheers and applause.)    JERICHO: Other than

553
00:28:03,626 --> 00:28:07,417
Space Rogue, any of you nominees in the room?

554
00:28:07,417 --> 00:28:10,667
AUDIENCE: (Speaker away from microphone.)    JERICHO: Yeah,

555
00:28:10,667 --> 00:28:14,999
yeah, 87 percent of the room is anonymous probably.

556
00:28:15,334 --> 00:28:16,334
Okay.

557
00:28:16,334 --> 00:28:20,209
RUSS: Can we mix it up a little bit?

558
00:28:20,209 --> 00:28:21,834
How many of you have been in this community

559
00:28:21,834 --> 00:28:25,250
and following DEF CON for at least ten years?

560
00:28:25,417 --> 00:28:28,167
All right, not even half the room.

561
00:28:28,501 --> 00:28:29,918
Here is the thing.

562
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:32,918
If you know Space Rogue and you -- (Cheers

563
00:28:32,918 --> 00:28:37,626
and applause.)    RUSS: And you follow the Hacker News Network

564
00:28:37,626 --> 00:28:42,250
in the day --    JERICHO: The Hacker News Network, HNN is not

565
00:28:42,250 --> 00:28:44,542
the Hacker News.

566
00:28:44,542 --> 00:28:45,542
RUSS: Right.

567
00:28:45,542 --> 00:28:47,459
JERICHO: This is a wanna-be rip off.

568
00:28:47,459 --> 00:28:51,459
RUSS: I'm trying to draw a line there.

569
00:28:51,459 --> 00:28:52,999
There was the original HNN which was

570
00:28:52,999 --> 00:28:54,709
Space Rogue.

571
00:28:54,709 --> 00:28:56,334
It was awesome.

572
00:28:56,334 --> 00:28:58,918
RUSS: Now there is the facsimile of such which is kind

573
00:28:58,918 --> 00:29:02,125
of like candy cane dipped in bird shit.

574
00:29:02,999 --> 00:29:06,667
(Laughter.)    JERICHO: Someone is going to win

575
00:29:06,667 --> 00:29:09,834
the arbitrary insult award.

576
00:29:09,834 --> 00:29:13,834
(Laughter.)    RUSS: I just want to draw that line.

577
00:29:13,834 --> 00:29:16,999
If you have been around ten years, it is not the same HNN.

578
00:29:16,999 --> 00:29:19,834
JERICHO: Now we are going to vote.

579
00:29:20,876 --> 00:29:22,209
IO Air.

580
00:29:22,501 --> 00:29:26,334
(Some applause and cheering.)    RUSS: It's better

581
00:29:26,334 --> 00:29:28,542
than nothing.

582
00:29:28,876 --> 00:29:30,709
No, it's not actually!

583
00:29:30,709 --> 00:29:32,792
It's not better than nothing.

584
00:29:32,792 --> 00:29:36,083
JERICHO: I think that was a little quieter than the idle room is.

585
00:29:37,584 --> 00:29:39,709
Someone goes -- sorry, Jacob.

586
00:29:42,167 --> 00:29:43,918
Moxie.

587
00:29:43,999 --> 00:29:46,209
(Cheers and applause.)    JERICHO:

588
00:29:46,209 --> 00:29:50,999
Seventy-eight-ish, I forgot to hit the button.

589
00:29:51,209 --> 00:29:52,999
your incompetence.

590
00:29:52,999 --> 00:29:53,999
My fault.

591
00:29:56,626 --> 00:29:58,999
Your Anon News.

592
00:30:02,626 --> 00:30:05,751
(Cheers and applause.)    RUSS: Don't laugh.

593
00:30:05,751 --> 00:30:06,999
It's winning right now.

594
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,626
JERICHO: Urine?

595
00:30:12,999 --> 00:30:15,292
We can have fun with this.

596
00:30:17,167 --> 00:30:18,918
Oh, yeah.

597
00:30:19,999 --> 00:30:21,083
Penis.

598
00:30:30,334 --> 00:30:32,834
Back Dick drop table.

599
00:30:39,626 --> 00:30:43,876
(Cheers and applause.)    RUSS: We need an award for that.

600
00:30:44,751 --> 00:30:46,626
AUDIENCE: Sweet.

601
00:30:46,626 --> 00:30:48,999
JERICHO: Designated drinker, drink that!

602
00:30:48,999 --> 00:30:52,459
AUDIENCE: (Speaker away from microphone.)    JERICHO: He's

603
00:30:52,459 --> 00:30:56,999
our designated drinker for the stage, too.

604
00:30:56,999 --> 00:31:00,584
And last Hacker Huntress?

605
00:31:00,584 --> 00:31:03,792
(Cheers and applause.)    RUSS: You skipped.

606
00:31:03,792 --> 00:31:05,292
JERICHO: Oh!

607
00:31:05,292 --> 00:31:06,959
RUSS: It was 85.

608
00:31:06,959 --> 00:31:08,501
AUDIENCE: (Speaker away from microphone.)    JERICHO: No

609
00:31:08,501 --> 00:31:10,083
one important.

610
00:31:10,501 --> 00:31:14,542
(Laughter.)    JERICHO: Okay, fine.

611
00:31:14,792 --> 00:31:15,792
Space Rogue.

612
00:31:15,792 --> 00:31:25,375
(Cheers and applause.) (One loud shout.)    RUSS: You get on!

613
00:31:25,375 --> 00:31:34,459
(Laughter.)    JERICHO: So by popular vote the Hacker News -- no!

614
00:31:34,459 --> 00:31:38,167
Oh, ho ho ho.

615
00:31:38,167 --> 00:31:41,167
We are going to make you come up here and drink since you won.

616
00:31:51,999 --> 00:31:54,459
(Cheers and applause.)    JERICHO: Are we

617
00:31:54,459 --> 00:31:56,999
close to end or did you guys get promised

618
00:31:56,999 --> 00:32:00,334
free shots, all of you who just came in?

619
00:32:01,250 --> 00:32:02,959
Free shots?

620
00:32:03,083 --> 00:32:05,417
Well, your only chance of getting a free shot is to come down here

621
00:32:05,417 --> 00:32:07,667
and make noise when you're told to.

622
00:32:10,250 --> 00:32:14,751
Seriously, space rogue has been doing the hacker news for a long time.

623
00:32:14,918 --> 00:32:16,375
He would wake up at some obscene hour

624
00:32:16,375 --> 00:32:20,083
and I know because I was up from the night before.

625
00:32:20,834 --> 00:32:23,999
There's something you need to know about him that my friend Carol

626
00:32:23,999 --> 00:32:26,959
and I, we would do editing for him.

627
00:32:26,959 --> 00:32:28,083
RUSS: Caroline Minot?

628
00:32:28,292 --> 00:32:30,542
JERICHO: No, Caroline Findlay.

629
00:32:32,999 --> 00:32:36,584
He has his own form of English called Spaceronics.

630
00:32:37,209 --> 00:32:40,542
Every morning he writes articles minus

631
00:32:40,542 --> 00:32:44,834
the -- I don't want to say clever use.

632
00:32:44,834 --> 00:32:47,834
I want to say fisting of the English language.

633
00:32:49,334 --> 00:32:51,334
The content was there.

634
00:32:53,626 --> 00:32:56,209
And Carol would wake up early and I would be up from the night

635
00:32:56,209 --> 00:32:58,792
before and we would edit his crap.

636
00:32:59,125 --> 00:33:00,709
Thank you, Space Rogue.

637
00:33:00,709 --> 00:33:03,709
You've done a great thing for the community for a long time.

638
00:33:03,709 --> 00:33:06,999
(Cheers and applause.)    JERICHO: We had

639
00:33:06,999 --> 00:33:08,959
the good.

640
00:33:09,167 --> 00:33:10,792
Now we need the bad.

641
00:33:10,792 --> 00:33:13,250
RUSS: I forgot to change the title of that one.

642
00:33:13,250 --> 00:33:14,250
JERICHO: Drink.

643
00:33:15,709 --> 00:33:17,999
You don't get to designate that one either.

644
00:33:17,999 --> 00:33:19,501
That's purely on you.

645
00:33:27,250 --> 00:33:29,167
AUDIENCE: (Speaker away from microphone.)    JERICHO: If you

646
00:33:29,167 --> 00:33:32,334
want free shots, come up here and make noise when you're told.

647
00:33:32,334 --> 00:33:34,959
Come sit down and help vote.

648
00:33:35,250 --> 00:33:39,584
RUSS: There's a celebrity in the front row, too.

649
00:33:39,751 --> 00:33:44,334
JERICHO: The Nit-Twit award because someone forgot to change

650
00:33:44,334 --> 00:33:47,083
the name on this slide.

651
00:33:47,334 --> 00:33:51,999
Voting for the Twitter feed considered the worst.

652
00:33:52,375 --> 00:33:55,083
The first nominee is the Jester.

653
00:33:55,083 --> 00:33:56,459
Who follows the Jester?

654
00:33:57,667 --> 00:34:01,375
RUSS: No nominated the Jester?

655
00:34:01,375 --> 00:34:03,876
JERICHO: Just one person?

656
00:34:03,876 --> 00:34:06,709
AUDIENCE: Was it anonymous?

657
00:34:06,918 --> 00:34:10,501
JERICHO: We only got IP addresses and last I heard, they are

658
00:34:10,501 --> 00:34:12,999
a little untrustworthy.

659
00:34:13,083 --> 00:34:15,167
Next, white rabbit.

660
00:34:15,167 --> 00:34:16,667
Anyone follow him?

661
00:34:16,667 --> 00:34:26,375
AUDIENCE: (Speaker away from microphone.)    AUDIENCE: Her.

662
00:34:26,375 --> 00:34:27,501
No, him.

663
00:34:27,501 --> 00:34:28,501
JERICHO: It.

664
00:34:28,501 --> 00:34:31,999
RUSS: There's a debate in the front row whether it has genitalia.

665
00:34:31,999 --> 00:34:33,792
JERICHO: Third, Asher Research?

666
00:34:33,792 --> 00:34:34,792
Anyone?

667
00:34:35,667 --> 00:34:37,501
Gregory Evans?

668
00:34:37,876 --> 00:34:39,083
I know that most of you don't follow

669
00:34:39,083 --> 00:34:42,417
because his account has been locked a long time because of me.

670
00:34:42,751 --> 00:34:44,999
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

671
00:34:44,999 --> 00:34:46,876
JERICHO: Last, Ada initiative.

672
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:48,959
Hey, Val, you in the room?

673
00:34:49,083 --> 00:34:52,167
I want to talk do you about some Dongle.

674
00:34:54,709 --> 00:34:57,209
RUSS: You know, there's a certain iron that they're

675
00:34:57,209 --> 00:34:59,459
on the 20_th_ Twat award.

676
00:35:01,375 --> 00:35:03,250
We did change that.

677
00:35:04,792 --> 00:35:07,083
It is the Nit-Twit award.

678
00:35:07,083 --> 00:35:08,542
I'll get in trouble for that.

679
00:35:08,542 --> 00:35:11,250
JERICHO: All right, speed this up a little bit, too.

680
00:35:11,709 --> 00:35:13,125
The Jester.

681
00:35:13,667 --> 00:35:16,209
Make noise if you think it's the worst Twitter feed.

682
00:35:19,292 --> 00:35:21,417
(Cheers and applause.)    JERICHO:

683
00:35:21,417 --> 00:35:23,167
White Rabbit.

684
00:35:23,501 --> 00:35:28,501
(Cheers and applause.)    RUSS: He's getting louder.

685
00:35:28,501 --> 00:35:30,709
AUDIENCE: He's drinking more.

686
00:35:30,709 --> 00:35:32,083
RUSS: You want more.

687
00:35:32,083 --> 00:35:34,501
JERICHO: Asher Research?

688
00:35:37,834 --> 00:35:41,999
(One cheer.)    RUSS: I was wrong, you can make it go backwards.

689
00:35:41,999 --> 00:35:46,083
JERICHO: Gregory Evans?

690
00:35:46,626 --> 00:35:50,959
(Loud cheers and applause.)    JERICHO: White

691
00:35:50,959 --> 00:35:53,834
Rabbit thanks you.

692
00:35:54,083 --> 00:35:58,501
RUSS: Everyone is still really confused about that one.

693
00:35:58,501 --> 00:35:59,999
JERICHO: Ada initiative.

694
00:36:14,584 --> 00:36:17,417
(Cheers and applause.)    JERICHO: Sorry that

695
00:36:17,417 --> 00:36:20,542
was a muscle spasm, nothing else.

696
00:36:20,999 --> 00:36:22,999
And aside little -- Okay.

697
00:36:23,375 --> 00:36:26,167
RUSS: It was Ada.

698
00:36:26,667 --> 00:36:29,209
JERICHO: Valor the other chick?

699
00:36:29,250 --> 00:36:30,292
You want to come up here and we can discuss your

700
00:36:30,292 --> 00:36:32,501
financials that have been leaked out?

701
00:36:33,918 --> 00:36:34,999
Anyone?

702
00:36:34,999 --> 00:36:35,999
Anyone?

703
00:36:35,999 --> 00:36:37,667
RUSS: You can have a shot, too.

704
00:36:37,667 --> 00:36:38,667
JERICHO: A shot.

705
00:36:38,667 --> 00:36:39,999
Consensual shot.

706
00:36:41,083 --> 00:36:43,375
Okay, fine, we'll send your award later.

707
00:36:43,459 --> 00:36:48,999
I'm not going to spend time on this one, Best Project by a DEF CON Group.

708
00:36:48,999 --> 00:36:52,125
We had two nominees, one had 87 votes and

709
00:36:52,125 --> 00:36:54,999
the other had one.

710
00:36:55,083 --> 00:36:57,417
Honey pot that can bite.

711
00:36:57,417 --> 00:36:58,751
Anyone involved in that?

712
00:36:58,751 --> 00:36:59,999
RUSS: Anyone?

713
00:36:59,999 --> 00:37:01,083
It's free booze.

714
00:37:01,083 --> 00:37:04,584
JERICHO: It's a DEF CON group something.

715
00:37:04,584 --> 00:37:06,751
I don't know, you're supposed to be here.

716
00:37:06,834 --> 00:37:08,083
Fuckers.

717
00:37:08,083 --> 00:37:10,167
AUDIENCE: (Speaker away from microphone.)    RUSS: You

718
00:37:10,167 --> 00:37:11,667
can lie.

719
00:37:11,667 --> 00:37:13,125
We don't have whiskey, though.

720
00:37:13,501 --> 00:37:16,999
JERICHO: Anyway, that one was an obvious rigged vote.

721
00:37:16,999 --> 00:37:17,667
We'll give it to them because they are

722
00:37:17,667 --> 00:37:19,626
spirited, congratulations.

723
00:37:20,083 --> 00:37:23,876
Worst Security Buzzword since DEF CON 20.

724
00:37:23,876 --> 00:37:25,667
It took a hold of the news.

725
00:37:25,709 --> 00:37:31,501
AUDIENCE: (Speaker away from microphone.)    Indicator.

726
00:37:31,501 --> 00:37:34,125
JERICHO: Remember, some of these were nominated.

727
00:37:34,125 --> 00:37:36,999
RUSS: Drink!

728
00:37:37,375 --> 00:37:38,876
Drink!

729
00:37:39,125 --> 00:37:40,626
Drink!

730
00:37:40,999 --> 00:37:42,375
Drink!

731
00:37:42,876 --> 00:37:44,125
Drink!

732
00:37:44,626 --> 00:37:46,167
It is not mine.

733
00:37:46,209 --> 00:37:47,209
It's his.

734
00:37:47,209 --> 00:37:49,167
JERICHO: The laptop owner drinks.

735
00:37:54,083 --> 00:37:55,375
Okay.

736
00:37:55,834 --> 00:37:57,501
We're going down these real quick.

737
00:37:57,501 --> 00:37:58,501
APT.

738
00:37:58,501 --> 00:38:04,999
(Cheers and applause.)    JERICHO:

739
00:38:04,999 --> 00:38:10,876
Buzzwords, plural.

740
00:38:10,876 --> 00:38:11,876
Shut up.

741
00:38:11,876 --> 00:38:14,209
AUDIENCE: How is that anything for security?

742
00:38:14,209 --> 00:38:16,125
JERICHO: Security community, duh.

743
00:38:16,125 --> 00:38:17,125
Cloud.

744
00:38:20,334 --> 00:38:23,083
Yeah, that one we probably shouldn't included.

745
00:38:23,417 --> 00:38:24,417
Give you that.

746
00:38:25,083 --> 00:38:27,459
CEH, Certified Ethical Hacker.

747
00:38:27,459 --> 00:38:34,375
(Cheers and laugh.)    JERICHO: That's a respectable number of laughs.

748
00:38:34,626 --> 00:38:39,999
I'll tell Jay Bavisi, the head of the EC-Council, about that one.

749
00:38:40,125 --> 00:38:44,918
AUDIENCE: (Speaker away from microphone.)    JERICHO: No,

750
00:38:44,918 --> 00:38:48,709
I'm not really missing it at all.

751
00:38:48,918 --> 00:38:50,083
ADA Initiative.

752
00:38:50,250 --> 00:38:54,667
(Cheers and applause.)    RUSS: I like that.

753
00:38:54,667 --> 00:38:56,083
JERICHO: Damn, you're loud.

754
00:38:56,083 --> 00:38:57,083
Okay.

755
00:38:57,083 --> 00:38:58,083
Anonymous.

756
00:38:58,250 --> 00:39:01,417
That's another one we probably should have dropped since ...

757
00:39:01,417 --> 00:39:02,417
yeah.

758
00:39:02,417 --> 00:39:03,542
We'll skip that one.

759
00:39:03,542 --> 00:39:04,542
Cyber.

760
00:39:04,751 --> 00:39:07,459
(Loud cheers and applause.)    JERICHO: The irony,

761
00:39:07,459 --> 00:39:12,167
of course, is that all of you should be drinking for that.

762
00:39:13,999 --> 00:39:15,584
Shut up.

763
00:39:17,292 --> 00:39:18,792
China.

764
00:39:22,918 --> 00:39:25,125
RUSS: That's all you've got?

765
00:39:29,375 --> 00:39:31,792
JERICHO: Nice.

766
00:39:31,792 --> 00:39:32,792
Last, Snowden.

767
00:39:32,792 --> 00:39:34,999
(Loud cheers and applause.)    RUSS: Hmm.

768
00:39:38,083 --> 00:39:39,959
All right.

769
00:39:43,459 --> 00:39:48,999
JERICHO: The award is cyber, and we are all losers for that one.

770
00:39:49,334 --> 00:39:52,292
RUSS: Everyone drink.

771
00:39:52,292 --> 00:39:56,375
JERICHO: All right, we've got five minutes.

772
00:39:56,375 --> 00:39:57,999
We have to really do this quick.

773
00:39:57,999 --> 00:40:02,209
Biggest Law Enforcement/Legal System Blunder since DEF CON 20.

774
00:40:02,501 --> 00:40:04,626
We are not going to take votes.

775
00:40:04,626 --> 00:40:08,250
(Some applause.)    JERICHO: We are going to call all of these the winner,

776
00:40:08,250 --> 00:40:11,999
on how law enforcement fucked up in big ways.

777
00:40:15,709 --> 00:40:19,834
Real quick, unofficial award, Best Con, Pwns, if you missed them at Black Hat,

778
00:40:19,834 --> 00:40:21,501
see the video.

779
00:40:21,501 --> 00:40:22,501
They are funny.

780
00:40:25,209 --> 00:40:28,999
Security humor, really, really clever.

781
00:40:28,999 --> 00:40:29,999
Follow -- hmm?

782
00:40:32,999 --> 00:40:36,375
Best book on freaking this year, exploding the phone.

783
00:40:36,375 --> 00:40:39,000
If any of you are interested in telephone and freaking history,

784
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,959
get the book.

785
00:40:41,292 --> 00:40:46,334
Internet hacker security historian of the year, Jason Scott.

786
00:40:48,042 --> 00:40:49,501
Yeah!

787
00:40:51,167 --> 00:40:56,501
By the way, if any of you use the Internet, go donate to archive.org.

788
00:40:56,501 --> 00:40:59,542
If you have any old hacker stuff sitting in your closet, old paperwork

789
00:40:59,542 --> 00:41:03,999
or whatever, work with Jason to make sure it gets in the right hands.

790
00:41:03,999 --> 00:41:06,918
Many people ship stuff to him, he makes sure it goes

791
00:41:06,918 --> 00:41:10,751
to the right places, certain museums or initiatives dedicated

792
00:41:10,751 --> 00:41:13,709
to collecting that information.

793
00:41:13,918 --> 00:41:14,999
Awesome work.

794
00:41:14,999 --> 00:41:18,999
Most prolific tweeter most desperate for an award?

795
00:41:19,999 --> 00:41:23,334
So last, how much time do we have?

796
00:41:23,334 --> 00:41:24,334
Two minutes?

797
00:41:24,334 --> 00:41:25,334
Three?

798
00:41:25,334 --> 00:41:26,459
Hey, goon?

799
00:41:26,459 --> 00:41:27,959
RUSS: You have 15.

800
00:41:27,959 --> 00:41:30,542
What about the slide ...

801
00:41:30,542 --> 00:41:32,792
JERICHO: Russ said 15.

802
00:41:32,792 --> 00:41:33,792
I like his answer.

803
00:41:33,834 --> 00:41:37,209
RUSS: I can roll it a little bit.

804
00:41:38,125 --> 00:41:41,334
Who is going to fight somebody with free booze on the stage.

805
00:41:41,999 --> 00:41:48,083
JERICHO: Security Charlatan of the Year nominations.

806
00:41:48,167 --> 00:41:57,292
I did not vote, but I worked with my team, the first is Ankit Fadia.

807
00:41:57,876 --> 00:41:58,999
Anyone know him?

808
00:42:02,501 --> 00:42:05,209
No, what did he do this year?

809
00:42:05,209 --> 00:42:07,959
He gave the same presentation he has been giving

810
00:42:07,959 --> 00:42:11,667
for the past 13 years where he still uses Back Orifice

811
00:42:11,667 --> 00:42:15,459
as an example for a remote access trojan.

812
00:42:16,709 --> 00:42:18,999
RUSS: On that note, is anybody

813
00:42:18,999 --> 00:42:25,167
aside from Space Rogue here that was involved in any of the Back Orifice stuff.

814
00:42:25,167 --> 00:42:27,125
I would like to give them a shot, too.

815
00:42:27,125 --> 00:42:28,792
Do we have Dildog?

816
00:42:29,626 --> 00:42:32,334
JERICHO: Any of you L0PHT bitches.

817
00:42:34,083 --> 00:42:36,292
Rahul Chagi?

818
00:42:38,792 --> 00:42:40,999
He's like a Fadia light?

819
00:42:42,542 --> 00:42:45,292
Kim.com Schmitz?

820
00:42:45,999 --> 00:42:49,250
Most of you heard the news about him, his antics,

821
00:42:49,250 --> 00:42:52,999
mega this and mega fuckwad and all that.

822
00:42:53,999 --> 00:42:57,209
He has a long history before that of fraud and all kinds

823
00:42:57,209 --> 00:42:59,959
of other interesting stuff.

824
00:42:59,959 --> 00:43:01,250
Make sure you read up on that.

825
00:43:01,709 --> 00:43:04,876
I do not know the story behind this one but I got votes.

826
00:43:04,876 --> 00:43:06,167
Ford and Net Security?

827
00:43:07,959 --> 00:43:10,459
RUSS: He still wants a shot.

828
00:43:10,459 --> 00:43:11,999
JERICHO: Afterwards if you know why

829
00:43:11,999 --> 00:43:14,999
they should be nominated, let me know.

830
00:43:15,250 --> 00:43:17,209
Same with this one, Chris Russo?

831
00:43:19,250 --> 00:43:21,083
Chris, are you in the room?

832
00:43:21,083 --> 00:43:23,501
Can I buy you a shot and get your secrets?

833
00:43:24,584 --> 00:43:25,999
Bottle?

834
00:43:25,999 --> 00:43:26,999
Okay.

835
00:43:27,334 --> 00:43:29,542
So based on that, and I know it's a little blind

836
00:43:29,542 --> 00:43:32,375
because if you did your homework you would have read

837
00:43:32,375 --> 00:43:34,999
about these people in advance.

838
00:43:35,334 --> 00:43:37,250
So Ankit Fadia.

839
00:43:42,292 --> 00:43:44,125
(Cheers and applause.)    JERICHO:

840
00:43:44,125 --> 00:43:46,125
Seems complicated.

841
00:43:46,125 --> 00:43:47,125
RUSS: It is.

842
00:43:47,125 --> 00:43:50,626
JERICHO: By that I mean it's not easy to say.

843
00:43:50,667 --> 00:43:51,999
Fuck you.

844
00:43:53,626 --> 00:43:55,999
Rahul Chagi.

845
00:43:55,999 --> 00:44:00,083
(Cheers and applause.)    JERICHO: I'll make sure to write him and say that

846
00:44:00,083 --> 00:44:02,999
he sucked at this award, too.

847
00:44:05,709 --> 00:44:08,334
Kim.com Schmitz.

848
00:44:10,834 --> 00:44:19,501
(Loud cheers and applause and yelling.)    JERICHO: I don't care if he wins.

849
00:44:19,667 --> 00:44:21,999
Get another shot and designate his shot.

850
00:44:24,999 --> 00:44:27,083
Ford and Net Security.

851
00:44:29,250 --> 00:44:30,667
Yeah!

852
00:44:30,792 --> 00:44:33,959
Listen, people, if you are going to nominate someone, give us details,

853
00:44:33,959 --> 00:44:36,542
juicy dirt I can spill on stage.

854
00:44:36,542 --> 00:44:39,083
RUSS: Or at least show up so you can vote for them.

855
00:44:39,083 --> 00:44:40,083
JERICHO: Yeah.

856
00:44:41,209 --> 00:44:44,125
And last, Chris Russo?

857
00:44:45,626 --> 00:44:50,375
(One cheer.)    RUSS: I wish we had a cricket sound track.

858
00:44:52,167 --> 00:44:55,999
It would be too loud.

859
00:44:55,999 --> 00:45:00,999
JERICHO: We'll test your interest in the community, just for fun.

860
00:45:01,375 --> 00:45:05,083
Also nominated but not on this list Fernando Gaunt.

861
00:45:05,083 --> 00:45:07,999
(Laughter.) (One loud yell.)    AUDIENCE: Background?

862
00:45:07,999 --> 00:45:11,667
No, I don't.

863
00:45:11,709 --> 00:45:15,999
AUDIENCE: (Speaker away from microphone.)    JERICHO: That

864
00:45:15,999 --> 00:45:18,334
was intentional.

865
00:45:18,334 --> 00:45:19,334
I was curious.

866
00:45:19,334 --> 00:45:21,626
Thank you, thank you, okay.

867
00:45:21,626 --> 00:45:26,501
So Kim.com Schmitz is the winner of the Security Charlatan Award

868
00:45:26,501 --> 00:45:28,334
this year.

869
00:45:30,209 --> 00:45:33,792
Everyone, take this Power Point presentation, highlight his name

870
00:45:33,792 --> 00:45:36,584
and upload it to his mega service.

871
00:45:37,959 --> 00:45:41,999
Next year, we'll have more nominations, different categories maybe.

872
00:45:41,999 --> 00:45:44,584
We will actually have trophies and more booze and hopefully we'll

873
00:45:44,584 --> 00:45:46,542
have more people.

874
00:45:46,542 --> 00:45:49,417
All of you who came in for free shots, DEF CON parties is ready

875
00:45:49,417 --> 00:45:52,250
to give them to you later tonight.

876
00:45:52,584 --> 00:45:53,584
Thank you!

877
00:45:53,626 --> 00:45:55,999
RUSS: Thanks, guys.
