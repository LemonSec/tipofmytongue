00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:10,670
[Music]

2
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:16,309
I was actually quite looking forward to

3
00:00:16,309 --> 00:00:18,710
moderate this talk because OPSEC aside I

4
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:21,020
have to admit I now cloud you quite well

5
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:22,970
and why is that because we share a

6
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:25,340
co-working space and the third tenant is

7
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:27,470
a drumset and this is important to know

8
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:30,860
for the little story I tell now I almost

9
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:33,440
I always noticed when he does his work

10
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:36,110
breaks because first he reads Twitter

11
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:38,300
for 10 minutes then he gets triggered

12
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:40,670
and the next thing I know is a 45

13
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:43,970
minutes drum solo in a vegan death metal

14
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:46,879
and I don't know who how many of you are

15
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:49,629
familiar with Gorgoroth

16
00:00:49,629 --> 00:00:54,019
yeah but that's not always pleasant and

17
00:00:54,019 --> 00:00:55,930
I noticed something changed during the

18
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:59,150
last few weeks and I wondered what

19
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:01,309
happened and part of the explanation for

20
00:01:01,309 --> 00:01:04,129
this is this talk and so if you

21
00:01:04,129 --> 00:01:05,930
discourage Cloudy with this new project

22
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:08,840
then the drum solos during work hours

23
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:11,299
start again and I would thank you please

24
00:01:11,299 --> 00:01:13,880
don't do that but I welcome him with a

25
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:15,500
big round of applause

26
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:17,990
Claudia granya security researcher with

27
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:20,750
Amnesty International and fellow at the

28
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:21,720
citizen lab

29
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:28,209
[Applause]

30
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:32,560
well hello to everybody so firstly I

31
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,390
have to say I'm a bit sick so my crises

32
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:37,960
in that great so please bear with me

33
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:41,079
secondly usual disclaimer everything

34
00:01:41,079 --> 00:01:42,850
that I'm going to say today is purely

35
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:45,310
just my opinion does not represent any

36
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:47,770
of the opinions of my employer any of

37
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:51,670
the organizations that I work with I'm

38
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:53,109
gonna run for a little today

39
00:01:53,109 --> 00:01:55,090
and actually it's the first time that I

40
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:57,759
give a non-technical talk and and that

41
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:01,989
kind of scares me a little but I hope

42
00:02:01,989 --> 00:02:06,579
it's gonna make sense so this is gonna

43
00:02:06,579 --> 00:02:09,549
be a reflection on the last few years of

44
00:02:09,549 --> 00:02:11,680
my experience and I'm a security

45
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,379
researcher by you know training and by

46
00:02:14,379 --> 00:02:17,610
profession and last year's I work

47
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:20,109
specifically in working with human

48
00:02:20,109 --> 00:02:22,540
rights organization and journalistic

49
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:24,459
organizations and civil society in

50
00:02:24,459 --> 00:02:28,390
general and assisting on security issues

51
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:29,590
and I've learned a lot of things

52
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:32,109
especially coming from more you know

53
00:02:32,109 --> 00:02:36,220
corporate security background so

54
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:38,739
computer systems you know were destined

55
00:02:38,739 --> 00:02:42,190
for a global cultural and economic

56
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:44,169
revolution I think that the Dower

57
00:02:44,169 --> 00:02:46,079
community the hacker community

58
00:02:46,079 --> 00:02:49,030
anticipated a long time ago and we saw

59
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:50,410
that potential and we saw it coming

60
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:53,829
early on and while we enjoyed that

61
00:02:53,829 --> 00:02:57,069
little time of good times of reckless

62
00:02:57,069 --> 00:02:59,709
banditry online and you know playing as

63
00:02:59,709 --> 00:03:02,919
the hackers movie teaches the cowboys of

64
00:03:02,919 --> 00:03:05,859
the early internet-connected age we also

65
00:03:05,859 --> 00:03:07,599
soon welcomed the global realization

66
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:10,389
that we were right all along that

67
00:03:10,389 --> 00:03:12,430
technology was going to become become

68
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:15,250
predominant in society and that

69
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:19,150
information technology was going to you

70
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:22,450
know change everything and computer

71
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:23,980
security in particular was going to be

72
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:27,040
critical and with that we embrace the

73
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,919
legitimization of our culture and with

74
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:31,989
that also the monetization of our skills

75
00:03:31,989 --> 00:03:36,609
you know and now the internet basically

76
00:03:36,609 --> 00:03:38,950
governs our lives

77
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:41,150
what's interesting is that the more a

78
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:44,060
principle of our subculture our counter

79
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:47,000
culture as some people say that was

80
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,440
traditionally subversive in an

81
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:50,480
anti-authoritarian have changed

82
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,580
radically and have been coming creasing

83
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:54,260
lead alluded with vested interests and

84
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:56,600
the traditional distrust for the state

85
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:59,480
is only meaningfully visible in some

86
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:02,540
corners of our community and this one

87
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:05,810
being one of them for the most part at

88
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:07,480
least the most visible one I would say

89
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:10,010
the security community but the industry

90
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:12,200
really in particular a night I make that

91
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,970
distinction quite often and throughout

92
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:17,149
this tea speech he's enjoying you know

93
00:04:17,149 --> 00:04:19,130
the the six-figure salaries they're

94
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:22,190
luxurious suites in Las Vegas the media

95
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:24,830
attention and you know the business

96
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:26,680
clerk's class traveling and all of that

97
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:31,490
and you know what concerns me is that

98
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:33,320
with with hackers you know having moved

99
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:35,030
through through their professional lives

100
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:37,400
and their careers in working for many

101
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:40,070
different sides of society and across

102
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:42,770
the entire political spectrum now it's

103
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:44,510
becoming really difficult to identify

104
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:47,030
shared values among ourselves in the

105
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:48,919
larger in the larger in this larger

106
00:04:48,919 --> 00:04:54,710
community and what is what is to say is

107
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:56,450
also that the internet morphed with us

108
00:04:56,450 --> 00:04:58,910
it changed with us too so once it was

109
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:01,970
kind of an export space that we were

110
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:04,280
wandering in solitude and now it's

111
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:07,490
become a marketplace for goods it has

112
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:09,500
become the primary vehicle of global

113
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:12,050
communication it has become the place to

114
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:15,729
share cats and memes and porn news and

115
00:05:15,729 --> 00:05:20,479
also thankfully enough an unprecedented

116
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:23,660
platform for intellectual liberation

117
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:26,180
organization mobilization and so on and

118
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:29,120
and that's all great however to quote

119
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,710
Kevin Kelly there is no powerfully

120
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:32,690
constructive technology that is also not

121
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:33,919
powerfully destructive in another

122
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:36,440
direction just as there is no great idea

123
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,510
that cannot be greatly perverted for

124
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:40,580
great harm and indeed an invention or

125
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:42,350
idea is not really tremendous unless it

126
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:44,750
can be tremendously abused and this

127
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:47,000
should be the first law of technological

128
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,370
expectation the greater the promise of a

129
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:50,720
new technology and the greater is the

130
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,110
potential for harm as well

131
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:55,340
and sure enough we soon observed that

132
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:56,960
same technology in the Internet and

133
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,070
everything that we built over the

134
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:01,130
decades that you know we consider of

135
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:02,510
technology of liberation and

136
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:05,090
self-determination we we discovered it

137
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:06,560
being turned into a tool for repression

138
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,190
as well and it was inevitable there is

139
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:11,390
an every significant technological

140
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:14,120
imbalance between States and their

141
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:16,400
citizens and as billions or dollars are

142
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,560
poured into systems of surveillance both

143
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,900
passive and active and might not just by

144
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:22,490
the United States but really by any

145
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:23,930
government that is wealthy enough to do

146
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:27,260
so credible defense is really either a

147
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:29,150
lag behind or remaining accessible and

148
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:31,940
generally only available to corporations

149
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:33,760
and businesses with deep enough pockets

150
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,990
and a few ambitious free software

151
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:38,090
projects that we have attempting to

152
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:40,580
change things radically are often faced

153
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:42,500
with rudder and sustainable funding

154
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:46,070
models we truly will last long enough to

155
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:47,540
grow these projects to maturity and I

156
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:49,550
think this is a big issue that we need

157
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:52,730
to face really soon and nation states

158
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:54,380
are very well of seizing balance of this

159
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:56,330
technological imbalance and use it to

160
00:06:56,330 --> 00:06:58,730
their own advantage of course we've

161
00:06:58,730 --> 00:06:59,960
learned through the years that

162
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,640
technology is regular used to curb

163
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:03,680
dissent to censor information to

164
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,870
identify in monitor people especially

165
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:07,790
those engaging in political struggles

166
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:11,420
and societal struggles and we saw some

167
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:13,130
examples of it that are very well known

168
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:14,570
we saw the relentless attacks against

169
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:16,520
journalists in Ethiopia we saw the

170
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,740
crashing of protest movements and in

171
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:21,530
Bahrain didi hunting and hunting of

172
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:23,990
dissidents in Iran and Anna trashing

173
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:25,880
that then became of Syria and all of

174
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,920
this complemented with electronic

175
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:30,290
surveillance and censorship and it is

176
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:31,850
not an AI purply anymore to say that

177
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:33,260
people are getting arrested for a tweet

178
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:35,360
it just happens more and more every day

179
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,730
and anybody who negates this reality is

180
00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:41,350
just either miss guiding or misguided

181
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:45,500
and all of these cases that we observed

182
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,030
and we learn of over the years remind me

183
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:48,980
not only that that oppressive technology

184
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:51,110
can be used to silence people but you

185
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:53,030
know that we also take granted access to

186
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:55,610
two simple defensive technology or

187
00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:57,050
technology in general running in

188
00:07:57,050 --> 00:07:58,760
countries like Morocco Egypt the

189
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:01,040
Emirates and many others even simply

190
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:03,290
access to to encryption or the use of

191
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:04,760
encryption is normally forbidden by

192
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:05,370
default

193
00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:07,380
and that in other parts of the world

194
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:09,960
even basic communication platforms are

195
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,370
regularly blocked and at times even

196
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:13,620
entire access to Internet connections or

197
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:17,370
shut down for the entire nation and we

198
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:18,780
should be outraged and alone against

199
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:24,570
that I don't think we are enough so

200
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:27,510
security can no longer be a privilege or

201
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:29,130
a commodity in the hands of those few

202
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:31,770
who can afford it those who face

203
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:33,690
imprisonment and violence in the pursuit

204
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:35,520
of justice and democracy cannot succeed

205
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,110
if they don't you know communicate

206
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:38,700
securely as well as the remain safe

207
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,890
online and I think that's a lesson that

208
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:43,380
we have learned already security has to

209
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:45,330
become a right it has to be exercised

210
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:48,000
and protected it is pre-conditioner it

211
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,740
is the precondition for privacy which is

212
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:51,029
the key enabler for freedom of

213
00:08:51,029 --> 00:08:53,040
expression which is in our requirement

214
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:56,610
for a healthy democracy and while the

215
00:08:56,610 --> 00:08:57,750
security industry is becoming

216
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:59,370
increasingly dependent but both

217
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:02,220
financially and politically on on the

218
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:04,490
national security and defence sector I

219
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:06,930
think we find ourselves in a renewed

220
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:10,290
need for a structural structured social

221
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:12,060
and political arrangement from from the

222
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:18,900
hacker community and geeks like as often

223
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:20,400
do not get along very well with ethics

224
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,770
and politics I have to say until

225
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:24,680
eventually the groan of maturity I think

226
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:28,560
to recognize the implications and the

227
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,020
social responsibility we have as as

228
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:33,270
technologists and some of this some of

229
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:34,650
us get there sooner some of them get

230
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:36,300
there later some of some of us just

231
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:39,029
never will but having social

232
00:09:39,029 --> 00:09:42,390
consciousness is often I think even

233
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:44,820
cause of ridicule among techies and then

234
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:48,150
that's unbearable you can experience

235
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:50,250
this exclusion when you become outspoken

236
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:51,750
on matters that the larger security

237
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:52,980
community deems stranger to the

238
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:55,170
competences and you start seeing others

239
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:56,670
becoming patronizing and condescending

240
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:59,640
to you virtually not here not at

241
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:02,310
Congress but I'm sure many of you

242
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:04,350
experienced the same just as I did

243
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:07,170
elsewhere in other parts and if you

244
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:10,520
don't that let let that intimidate you

245
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,900
we need to recognize the privilege we

246
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:14,579
have as educated professionals and

247
00:10:14,579 --> 00:10:17,010
technicians the advantage we have with

248
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:18,600
our understanding of the many faces of

249
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,250
Technol

250
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:22,320
and realize that we cannot abdicate that

251
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,959
responsibility of upholding human rights

252
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:26,970
in the modern connected society

253
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:29,339
especially do I keep acting as its as

254
00:10:29,339 --> 00:10:32,970
its gatekeepers and be it creating or

255
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:34,920
contributing to free software or helping

256
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:37,350
someone in need or you know pushing

257
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:39,690
Internet corporations and being more

258
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:43,410
respectful to users privacy dedicating

259
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:44,970
your time and abilities to the benefit

260
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:47,100
of society is completely a political

261
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:49,470
choice and you should embrace that with

262
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:54,480
consciousness and pride the fact is that

263
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,850
there is there is a very prominent human

264
00:10:56,850 --> 00:10:59,339
rights culture and narrative and in the

265
00:10:59,339 --> 00:11:01,889
crypto community and but there is very

266
00:11:01,889 --> 00:11:03,389
little of that in the security community

267
00:11:03,389 --> 00:11:04,980
and especially in the industry and I

268
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:07,829
don't know why but that that definitely

269
00:11:07,829 --> 00:11:10,649
needs to change it is time to start

270
00:11:10,649 --> 00:11:12,480
asking ourselves what is that we working

271
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,010
for and what is that we working towards

272
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:18,320
and in our what name of our lives I

273
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,240
think we need to start to think and

274
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:24,140
formalize the idea of security activism

275
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:26,579
parallel to privacy activism in human

276
00:11:26,579 --> 00:11:27,990
rights activism model of all of these

277
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:30,089
forms of you know engagement and in

278
00:11:30,089 --> 00:11:33,149
society that we all already practice and

279
00:11:33,149 --> 00:11:35,339
we do have the means and hopefully also

280
00:11:35,339 --> 00:11:37,230
the will to do that but we also face a

281
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:39,779
lot of challenges in this and we need to

282
00:11:39,779 --> 00:11:41,459
rethink the strategies and then

283
00:11:41,459 --> 00:11:44,060
reconsider the tactics that we employ

284
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:46,910
and I thought about a lot about this and

285
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:49,470
in traditional activism there is there's

286
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:51,180
a predominant predominant concept which

287
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:53,190
is the concept of bearing witness you

288
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:54,570
know it is this is the practice of

289
00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:56,699
observing and documenting a wrongdoing

290
00:11:56,699 --> 00:12:00,390
and without interfering directly with

291
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:01,769
the assumption that exposing it to the

292
00:12:01,769 --> 00:12:04,260
world might be sufficient enough to

293
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:06,360
prevent it in the future from happening

294
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,430
again as a result of the public outcry

295
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:10,829
in the public attention and is viewed as

296
00:12:10,829 --> 00:12:12,569
a powerful tactic and quite often also

297
00:12:12,569 --> 00:12:14,660
the only available or meaningful tactic

298
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:17,220
this wasn't always the case in activist

299
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:18,690
movements the shift of tactics tactics

300
00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:20,850
externally witnessed in reaction to the

301
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:23,579
growth the legitimization the structural

302
00:12:23,579 --> 00:12:25,470
izing all of these movements themselves

303
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:27,930
we have to conform to the norms of

304
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:29,910
society and of acceptable behavior and

305
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:32,180
similarly as we

306
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:33,740
security researchers and technologies

307
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:36,140
and privacy activists conform to we also

308
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:38,839
bear witness in some way we observe we

309
00:12:38,839 --> 00:12:40,550
document we report on the abuses of

310
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:42,350
technology in a way that I believe is a

311
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:45,020
powerful play in that economic tension

312
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:48,070
that exists between offense and defense

313
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:50,089
being a journalist electronic

314
00:12:50,089 --> 00:12:51,890
communication intercepted or computer

315
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:55,310
compromised or the censorship of website

316
00:12:55,310 --> 00:12:56,990
or the blocking of messaging systems

317
00:12:56,990 --> 00:12:59,570
that we see you know pretty much every

318
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:02,810
week the exposure of technology that is

319
00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:04,640
being used to empower such repressions

320
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:06,560
it increments the cost of their

321
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,089
development in their operation that is a

322
00:13:08,089 --> 00:13:10,190
meaningful tactic as yarda tactic

323
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:13,100
defeated circumvented and consequently

324
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:15,050
necessarily re-engineered redeployed

325
00:13:15,050 --> 00:13:19,310
this process costs money and time an

326
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:20,899
exposure can effectively and effectively

327
00:13:20,899 --> 00:13:24,320
become a way to curb that in their

328
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,779
indiscriminate adoption and become

329
00:13:26,779 --> 00:13:29,000
basically an act of oversight in some

330
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,550
way by showing that there is competent

331
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:33,589
people watching out and that abuses

332
00:13:33,589 --> 00:13:36,290
won't go unnoticed and hacking team and

333
00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:37,910
finfisher Anasuya and all of these cases

334
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:39,650
are a great example of that there are

335
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:41,240
cases where operations of companies

336
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:43,070
producing spyware or other technologies

337
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:44,870
of sorts there are sold to governments

338
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:46,790
around the world were more effectively

339
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:49,339
understood and studied and scrutinized

340
00:13:49,339 --> 00:13:51,380
as a result of the public attention

341
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:53,120
derived from a bunch of geeks like us

342
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,250
and and researchers tracking and

343
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:56,680
repeatedly exposing the abuses

344
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:58,339
perpetrated through the use of such

345
00:13:58,339 --> 00:14:01,070
technology and then we have kids as well

346
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:03,890
where Phineas Fisher arrives and hacks

347
00:14:03,890 --> 00:14:05,450
the companies and licked all the emails

348
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:07,160
and documents and quite frankly our

349
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:10,010
players or however there is one

350
00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:11,600
fundamental flaw in the bearing witness

351
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,209
we practice it is a strategy that

352
00:14:14,209 --> 00:14:15,800
requires accountability in order to be

353
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,900
effective it implies that a perpetrator

354
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:21,070
of this wrongdoer is identifiable and

355
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:24,050
preferable and it requires you basically

356
00:14:24,050 --> 00:14:25,880
to teach his name and shame people and

357
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,440
organizations and states and

358
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,270
institutions and none of these

359
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:30,950
properties are often available to us in

360
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:31,730
a digital world

361
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:34,550
right the Internet provides abusers

362
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:35,930
plausible deniability and an

363
00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:38,690
accountability quite often so it makes

364
00:14:38,690 --> 00:14:40,250
you close impossible to identify the

365
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:41,990
abusers in the first place and in any

366
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:43,880
meaningful way I mean recently with

367
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:46,190
Shing seeing a shift of that but

368
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:48,260
let alone you know name and shade them

369
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:51,290
effectively and in our society bombarded

370
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:52,640
with information and increasingly

371
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:54,080
exposed through the media to the risks

372
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,160
and the breaches that happen almost

373
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,650
daily that the few stories we are able

374
00:14:57,650 --> 00:15:01,940
to tell on reproduction of dissent and

375
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:05,060
citizens become are becoming repetitive

376
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:08,840
and boring after all in the front of the

377
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,940
majesty of the moriah DDoS attacks and

378
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:13,010
you know entire country is being shut

379
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:16,160
down off the internet apparently and you

380
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,570
know the hundreds of millions of online

381
00:15:17,570 --> 00:15:19,220
accounts compromised every other week

382
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:22,040
even in front of the math Mastiff five

383
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:23,780
infrastructure of the part of the five

384
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:26,570
eyes and so on what is in the eyes of

385
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:28,580
the public an activist from the middle

386
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:29,960
east or some other part of the world

387
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:32,030
that is unknown to most and it's

388
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:34,040
compromised with a trap erosion that has

389
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,570
been part of the internet for twenty

390
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:36,050
five bucks

391
00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:37,460
you know that is not an interesting

392
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:40,220
story so we need to stop and take a deep

393
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:42,110
breath and look at the world around us

394
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:44,450
and see if we're missing the big picture

395
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:48,770
so a little bit of puppies to lift your

396
00:15:48,770 --> 00:15:52,030
spirits and for me to drink some water

397
00:15:56,020 --> 00:16:00,890
wonderful so firstly we need to stop

398
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:02,360
thinking that the most interesting or

399
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,250
flamboyant research is the most

400
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:06,820
important one

401
00:16:14,590 --> 00:16:17,570
and when companies like you know NS or

402
00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:19,790
hacking team or finfisher nor the most

403
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:22,250
well-known examples are found involved

404
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:24,380
in in violation of Human Rights of sorts

405
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:26,780
it makes it for a hell of a media story

406
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:29,690
you know and sometimes in research that

407
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:31,130
I worked on and I co-authored the

408
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:33,650
Vinland and front pages of printed major

409
00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:35,660
international newspapers and that's I

410
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:37,100
find that a bit ridiculous to be honest

411
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:40,010
but it's great in some way but through

412
00:16:40,010 --> 00:16:41,990
truth is that despite how legally and

413
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:43,460
politically important these cases are

414
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:44,870
and it's great to expose them and bring

415
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:46,220
them to the public attention as we have

416
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:48,260
done in the last years those cases are

417
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:50,330
also exceptions you know they're not

418
00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:52,070
particularly representative in fact to

419
00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:53,990
what is the reality of the use of

420
00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:55,730
technologies our tool for repression by

421
00:16:55,730 --> 00:16:59,830
most states and for one dissident found

422
00:16:59,830 --> 00:17:02,120
targeted with sophisticated commercial

423
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:04,369
spyware produced by a European company

424
00:17:04,369 --> 00:17:07,369
or American company or whatever there

425
00:17:07,369 --> 00:17:08,810
are hundreds more were infected with

426
00:17:08,810 --> 00:17:11,480
free to download poorly written Trojans

427
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:14,329
which you know would make any circular

428
00:17:14,329 --> 00:17:17,150
surgery gown and get bored immediately

429
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:19,250
but it is sort of equal attention in

430
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:21,410
some way and and what I've learned over

431
00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:23,329
the years in working in this field is

432
00:17:23,329 --> 00:17:25,069
that fighting is legitimate hacking and

433
00:17:25,069 --> 00:17:27,349
you know intrusion of journalists and

434
00:17:27,349 --> 00:17:28,670
dissidents isn't never-ending

435
00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:30,230
cat-and-mouse game first but it's also

436
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:34,550
better technically boring one however

437
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:36,320
once you grow out of the boredom other

438
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,450
side of yet another dark helmet or

439
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:41,060
Blackshades rat or a four years old

440
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:44,360
microsoft office exploit then you start

441
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:46,010
understanding the true value of this

442
00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:47,780
work which is that it's less technical

443
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:50,630
and it's more human and it is not about

444
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:52,640
the next hack of the next unusual device

445
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:55,610
or vehicle as it is not about ourselves

446
00:17:55,610 --> 00:17:59,840
or profiles or our careers and too often

447
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:02,900
we observe a toxic celebrity culture in

448
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:06,160
the hacker and the security communities

449
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,690
emphasize also obviously by the

450
00:18:08,690 --> 00:18:11,090
aggrandize and bias of the media that

451
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:13,700
too often looks for this story of you

452
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:16,520
know the renegade hacker and too often

453
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:19,940
we indulge into into that and often at

454
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:22,490
the expense of the victims of oppressive

455
00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:24,170
technologies who really struggle and

456
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:27,050
then and mostly remain unheard and you

457
00:18:27,050 --> 00:18:30,410
know unknown to our to most people so we

458
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:31,970
need to grow some humility and sorry

459
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:35,780
containing our egos I think the

460
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:40,430
challenges are many and I spent the last

461
00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:42,580
four years as I said kind of offering my

462
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:45,980
expertise and my modest skills to the

463
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:47,750
human rights community and while I have

464
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:49,310
to say that is greatly satisfying in a

465
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:50,630
way that I didn't find as much

466
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:53,630
satisfying previous corporate work it is

467
00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:57,260
also mastered antic struggle really you

468
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:59,240
know securing a global civil society is

469
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,830
a road filled with obstacles and

470
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:03,140
complication and while on the one hand

471
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:04,490
it can provide really interesting and

472
00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:06,410
presented challenges for our you know

473
00:19:06,410 --> 00:19:09,020
problem-solving minds as hackers the

474
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:10,610
resources are also comes with a troll of

475
00:19:10,610 --> 00:19:11,840
knowing that lives are at stake

476
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,790
and really that it's not just some

477
00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:15,770
intellectual property property or some

478
00:19:15,770 --> 00:19:18,170
profit or some couple of boxes blinking

479
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:21,530
boxes on a shelf thing at stake so how

480
00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:23,450
do you secure it distributed dissimilar

481
00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:26,210
and diverse and network of people who

482
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:27,920
face different risks different

483
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,240
adversaries and operate in different

484
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:30,980
places with different technologies and

485
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:32,150
different services

486
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:36,050
it's a topological nightmare and while

487
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:37,730
we did secure the community at large

488
00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:39,760
I don't mean just wing this in this room

489
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,410
secure corporations and organizations

490
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:44,540
with proper modeling you know by yoona

491
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:46,070
firming and tightening the technology

492
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:47,630
that is being adopted and by watching

493
00:19:47,630 --> 00:19:50,030
closely for anomalies in that model what

494
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:52,010
we the handful of technologies that are

495
00:19:52,010 --> 00:19:54,140
working in the human rights field often

496
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:56,510
can do is only recommend a stock

497
00:19:56,510 --> 00:19:58,400
software or another hoping that is not

498
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,380
going to fail the person that we are

499
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:03,290
helping quote-unquote so I've recently

500
00:20:03,290 --> 00:20:06,020
traveled to a West African country to

501
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:07,520
meet some local journalists and

502
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:10,280
activists and as perennial in my

503
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:12,320
checklist of things to preach around I

504
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:15,320
shall just want to encrypt this phone as

505
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:17,840
you normally would and lettering tonight

506
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,970
as we meet for dinner and he he comes in

507
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:23,030
the place and I starts waving his phone

508
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:26,420
at me and and these plates show that his

509
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:28,220
hand red phone had failed to the

510
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:30,560
encryption process despite having

511
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,660
followed all of the appropriate and

512
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:34,310
necessary steps it corrupted all of the

513
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:36,620
data on it and the person looked at me

514
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:38,000
and said I'm never going to crypt

515
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,889
anything ever again

516
00:20:39,889 --> 00:20:42,509
so sometimes the technology we advocate

517
00:20:42,509 --> 00:20:44,399
is inadequate sometimes it isn't

518
00:20:44,399 --> 00:20:46,549
accessible or just too expensive

519
00:20:46,549 --> 00:20:50,519
sometimes it just simply fails and we

520
00:20:50,519 --> 00:20:51,989
can't expect the world to fix itself

521
00:20:51,989 --> 00:20:53,629
just by making some tools available

522
00:20:53,629 --> 00:20:57,989
despite how vital they are and so that

523
00:20:57,989 --> 00:20:59,909
brings me to the second reflection which

524
00:20:59,909 --> 00:21:01,259
need which is that we needs to become

525
00:21:01,259 --> 00:21:05,309
more engaged so we need to become an

526
00:21:05,309 --> 00:21:06,839
integral part of the society social

527
00:21:06,839 --> 00:21:08,219
struggles and movements that are very

528
00:21:08,219 --> 00:21:10,469
much needed in this world right now and

529
00:21:10,469 --> 00:21:13,320
so my suggestion to is to find a cause

530
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:19,019
and assist others and you know being a

531
00:21:19,019 --> 00:21:20,759
local environmental organization

532
00:21:20,759 --> 00:21:22,409
campaigning against fracking or a

533
00:21:22,409 --> 00:21:24,059
citizen journalists group exposing

534
00:21:24,059 --> 00:21:26,279
corruption locally or global human

535
00:21:26,279 --> 00:21:27,629
rights organizations fighting injustice

536
00:21:27,629 --> 00:21:29,580
or even just assisting in the

537
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:32,009
policy-making field your help might make

538
00:21:32,009 --> 00:21:33,779
a significant impact much more there

539
00:21:33,779 --> 00:21:35,580
where I our expertise is so much lacking

540
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:38,789
and Congress with this space we have has

541
00:21:38,789 --> 00:21:40,799
so much too given that and rather than

542
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,989
lamenting a lack of technical content as

543
00:21:42,989 --> 00:21:45,179
they often read in here we should

544
00:21:45,179 --> 00:21:46,769
welcome with open arms all of the

545
00:21:46,769 --> 00:21:48,570
different voices that enable us for at

546
00:21:48,570 --> 00:21:51,629
least at one time a year to hear about

547
00:21:51,629 --> 00:21:53,580
what else goes on in the other corners

548
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:58,489
of society thank

549
00:22:02,259 --> 00:22:06,019
it is that one opportunity to learn more

550
00:22:06,019 --> 00:22:08,659
about ethics and politics on which very

551
00:22:08,659 --> 00:22:10,369
little we actually know of and actually

552
00:22:10,369 --> 00:22:12,349
very little will learn in our in our

553
00:22:12,349 --> 00:22:14,949
education technical education and

554
00:22:14,949 --> 00:22:17,359
perhaps today or tomorrow you'll learn

555
00:22:17,359 --> 00:22:19,039
or hear about some cause or some

556
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:20,089
projects that you might decide to

557
00:22:20,089 --> 00:22:21,589
contribute to and that it's already a

558
00:22:21,589 --> 00:22:24,319
success then we have Twitter our Twitter

559
00:22:24,319 --> 00:22:26,539
filter bubble and the rest of the you

560
00:22:26,539 --> 00:22:28,219
think about exploits and malware

561
00:22:28,219 --> 00:22:29,959
analysis and programming and all of this

562
00:22:29,959 --> 00:22:32,809
stuff I think that it's important to

563
00:22:32,809 --> 00:22:35,479
recognize but we can do more we can

564
00:22:35,479 --> 00:22:37,669
organize the problem is that civil

565
00:22:37,669 --> 00:22:39,529
society which is what I deeply care of

566
00:22:39,529 --> 00:22:41,359
suffers a fundamental lack of visibility

567
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:43,699
but also understanding of the threats it

568
00:22:43,699 --> 00:22:46,819
faces in this digital sphere because of

569
00:22:46,819 --> 00:22:49,399
a lack of internal expertise and the

570
00:22:49,399 --> 00:22:51,559
financial inability to access technology

571
00:22:51,559 --> 00:22:53,449
and solutions that you know are instead

572
00:22:53,449 --> 00:22:54,679
available to the corporate world

573
00:22:54,679 --> 00:22:55,999
literature certainly isn't making things

574
00:22:55,999 --> 00:22:58,099
any easier and the fact of the matter is

575
00:22:58,099 --> 00:22:59,839
that regular uses are no longer

576
00:22:59,839 --> 00:23:03,019
consumers of security let alone

577
00:23:03,019 --> 00:23:06,199
dissidents or journalists so we need to

578
00:23:06,199 --> 00:23:07,369
approach this problem differently I

579
00:23:07,369 --> 00:23:08,959
recognize the civil society isn't going

580
00:23:08,959 --> 00:23:11,839
to secure itself hackers and are in such

581
00:23:11,839 --> 00:23:14,749
high demand that and also it's so highly

582
00:23:14,749 --> 00:23:16,759
remunerated to say in the private sector

583
00:23:16,759 --> 00:23:19,369
I guess you guys know that I believe

584
00:23:19,369 --> 00:23:21,649
that civil society and the nonprofit

585
00:23:21,649 --> 00:23:22,879
sector in general have very little

586
00:23:22,879 --> 00:23:25,399
chances to build and adequate internal

587
00:23:25,399 --> 00:23:28,909
expertise it seems just an impossible

588
00:23:28,909 --> 00:23:31,819
struggle and not many would abandon

589
00:23:31,819 --> 00:23:33,529
their career to follow this path really

590
00:23:33,529 --> 00:23:35,959
and those that could do what they would

591
00:23:35,959 --> 00:23:39,549
want to probably probably even can't so

592
00:23:39,549 --> 00:23:42,259
what if we reverse this and what if you

593
00:23:42,259 --> 00:23:44,059
create a place for technicians to gather

594
00:23:44,059 --> 00:23:46,519
organize and work collectively on a

595
00:23:46,519 --> 00:23:48,199
volunteer basis or provide at least some

596
00:23:48,199 --> 00:23:51,889
assistance to civil society and that's

597
00:23:51,889 --> 00:23:56,209
where I'm getting at so let we need to

598
00:23:56,209 --> 00:23:58,879
flip this game and this is one attempt

599
00:23:58,879 --> 00:24:00,439
of doing so security without borders is

600
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:01,879
a project that I have the pleasure to

601
00:24:01,879 --> 00:24:04,279
announce here and it is it is an open

602
00:24:04,279 --> 00:24:05,779
collective of hackers and security

603
00:24:05,779 --> 00:24:07,609
professionals who volunteer with

604
00:24:07,609 --> 00:24:09,109
assisting journalists human rights

605
00:24:09,109 --> 00:24:10,249
defenders and nonprofit organizations

606
00:24:10,249 --> 00:24:12,949
with security issues we already gathered

607
00:24:12,949 --> 00:24:15,860
a number of people being penetration

608
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:18,559
Meyler analyst engineers researchers and

609
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:21,130
I invite all of you to join in some way

610
00:24:21,130 --> 00:24:30,200
we want to treat a structure we want to

611
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:32,929
create a structure able to assist

612
00:24:32,929 --> 00:24:34,790
voluntarily with penetration tests

613
00:24:34,790 --> 00:24:37,280
Incident Response Malheur analysis as

614
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:39,290
well as well as able to build tools

615
00:24:39,290 --> 00:24:41,090
write newsletters and make all of those

616
00:24:41,090 --> 00:24:43,160
missing components that will make civil

617
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:46,280
society a lot stronger and it's still

618
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:47,900
very much an experiment that will grow

619
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:50,210
obviously and change in adapt as people

620
00:24:50,210 --> 00:24:54,350
participate but the idea is to you know

621
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:56,330
reverse this problem and make sure that

622
00:24:56,330 --> 00:24:58,940
if we aggregate enough number of people

623
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:00,440
that can dedicate even one hour a week

624
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:04,040
we'll have enough you know manpower to

625
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:05,360
actually solve a lot of issues that are

626
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:09,830
remaining out unsolved right now so it

627
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:11,330
is - an experiment but I do believe

628
00:25:11,330 --> 00:25:13,160
however that if we come together and

629
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:14,630
through a coordinated effort of

630
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:17,240
solidarity and volunteering we can

631
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:19,040
perhaps make those those changes in

632
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,570
society that are very much needed and

633
00:25:20,570 --> 00:25:23,030
this time not not for fortune and fame

634
00:25:23,030 --> 00:25:26,419
but for that greater good that we all

635
00:25:26,419 --> 00:25:29,480
deep down aspire to and with that I

636
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:31,820
thank you all and you can go on the

637
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:33,320
website right now to find some more

638
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:35,840
details and find it ways to to reach out

639
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:39,668
and get in contact with this thank you

640
00:25:46,059 --> 00:25:48,159
thank you very much for the talk about

641
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:50,200
equal firepower we have plenty of time

642
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,969
for questions so if there are questions

643
00:25:51,969 --> 00:25:54,820
you can line up on that mic and on that

644
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:57,460
mic and in the meantime do we have

645
00:25:57,460 --> 00:25:59,590
questions from the internet signal angel

646
00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:03,190
okay okay so if that's that I'm sure

647
00:26:03,190 --> 00:26:05,559
that cloud can be approached aside the

648
00:26:05,559 --> 00:26:09,359
stage and I wish you good time so far

649
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:11,690
thank you
