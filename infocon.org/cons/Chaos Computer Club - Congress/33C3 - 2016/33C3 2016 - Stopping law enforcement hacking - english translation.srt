00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:19,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">the next talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ask you one</font>

3
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:21,320
thing

4
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:25,098
did you know that had been crypto Wars<font color="#E5E5E5"> 2</font>

5
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:29,630
point<font color="#E5E5E5"> 0 who has</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> known off</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> who has</font>

6
00:00:25,099 --> 00:00:31,759
knowledge of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 3-4</font>

7
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:34,339
hands so the most of us hackers even

8
00:00:31,759 --> 00:00:37,700
didn't know about crypto Wars 2 point 0

9
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:43,609
and it seems like we kind of lost it

10
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:46,730
so what are we doing now and one step to

11
00:00:43,609 --> 00:00:48,980
take would be to stopping<font color="#CCCCCC"> law</font>

12
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:51,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">enforcement hacking and how can we do</font>

13
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:54,468
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this is why</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Christopher's on</font>

15
00:00:54,469 --> 00:01:04,320

00:00:56,929 --> 00:01:06,750
thank you very much

talk to my community about this<font color="#E5E5E5"> so let</font>

37
00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:06,660
one thing before<font color="#CCCCCC"> i begin</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my talk which</font>

38
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:08,038
is not only am I not speaking on behalf

39
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:09,869
of my current employer but i'm

40
00:02:08,038 --> 00:02:13,950
definitely not speaking on behalf of any

41
00:02:09,869 --> 00:02:16,260
future employer government hacking is an

42
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:18,839
extremely controversial topic there are

43
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:21,179
mixed feelings<font color="#E5E5E5"> even within the hacker</font>

44
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:23,970
community and within civil society and

45
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:25,890
so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> recognize that my own views are</font>

46
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:28,200
definitely not mainstream even within

47
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:30,059
the community of people who fight the

48
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:33,209
government and fight law enforcement

49
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:34,920
surveillance<font color="#CCCCCC"> right so disclaimer number</font>

50
00:02:33,209 --> 00:02:39,269
two is actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> three disclaimers number</font>

51
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:41,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">two</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so this is a great quote from from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

52
00:02:39,269 --> 00:02:41,910
famous journalist<font color="#CCCCCC"> United States</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> real</font>

54
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:45,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">the trouble with fighting for human</font>

55
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:48,090
freedoms is that one spends most of

00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:49,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">one's time defending scoundrels for it</font>

57
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:52,320
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> again scandals that oppressive laws</font>

58
00:02:49,829 --> 00:02:54,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">our first aimed and oppression must be</font>

59
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:56,070
stopped at the beginning<font color="#CCCCCC"> if it is to be</font>

60
00:02:54,209 --> 00:02:57,690
stopped at all really what he's

61
00:02:56,070 --> 00:03:02,730
describing here

62
00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:05,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">so what he's describing here is the</font>

63
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:08,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">fiber many of the court cases that</font>

64
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:10,079
define our basic privacy rights come

65
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:13,950
from cases involving drug dealers

66
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:19,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">people-smuggling alcohol and pedophiles</font>

67
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:22,260
and so it can be very unpleasant for<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

68
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:25,500
people to sort of engage in these cases

69
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:27,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">but if you wait until the government is</font>

70
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:30,030
using its powers against journalists and

71
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:32,220
freedom fighters by that point the case

72
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:34,890
law<font color="#CCCCCC"> is settled</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and so if you care about</font>

73
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:37,080
our rights you have to roll up your

74
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:39,179
sleeves and get into some pretty

75
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:42,960
unpleasant fights and so that's in fact

76
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:46,620
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've done this year I volunteered</font>

77
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:49,200
in for child porn cases for the defense

78
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:52,110
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> my personal capacity</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> took time off</font>

79
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:53,640
from work<font color="#CCCCCC"> I didn't take any money and i</font>

80
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:55,680
went and volunteered in these cases

81
00:03:53,640 --> 00:04:00,149
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> i wanted</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to understand how the</font>

82
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:02,340
FBI hacks and these are the cases<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

83
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:04,440
unfortunate fact is the child porn cases

84
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:07,110
are the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the only cases we really know</font>

85
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:08,880
about where the most innovative and

86
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:11,790
troubling techniques are being used and

87
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:13,500
if you want to help<font color="#E5E5E5"> decide what the law</font>

88
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:14,609
of hacking is going to be this is where

89
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:16,649
the action is

90
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:21,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's probably the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> most difficult thing</font>

91
00:04:16,649 --> 00:04:23,789
I've ever done in terms of in terms of

92
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:25,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">of forcing me to confront my feelings</font>

93
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:28,440
about the state and about the criminal

94
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:29,640
justice system<font color="#CCCCCC"> i understand that there</font>

95
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:32,010
are many people in this community who

96
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:34,349
would not go that far<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> certainly</font>

97
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:38,669
kept me up at night on many evenings

98
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:41,370
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> I volunteered for the defense</font>

99
00:04:38,669 --> 00:04:43,020
and in several cases<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> seen</font>

100
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:45,180
things that are not public

101
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:46,200
I've seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> documents that are still</font>

102
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:49,530
sealed

103
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:51,479
I have copies of<font color="#E5E5E5"> of some software that</font>

104
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:53,369
the defense was provided provided<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">defense</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> still not public and what</font>

106
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:58,230
I want to emphasize is that everything

107
00:04:55,200 --> 00:05:00,090
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'll be describing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> today is based</font>

108
00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:02,760
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> public information</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> although</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I've</font>

109
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:03,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">worked as a volunteer expert for several</font>

110
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:05,969
different teams

111
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:07,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">nothing in this talk will rely on any</font>

112
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:09,020
information

113
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:11,480
and in that context alright and then

114
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:14,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">despite my number</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> three</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is gonna</font>

115
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:15,890
seem very<font color="#E5E5E5"> American centric and I</font>

116
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:19,099
apologize for that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i get from the</font>

117
00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:21,080
audience<font color="#E5E5E5"> here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm an american i live in</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> United States</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and the fact is that</font>

119
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:26,570
my government is<font color="#E5E5E5"> has been more open</font>

120
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:27,680
about its use of hacking<font color="#E5E5E5"> than many other</font>

121
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:30,320
governments and that's not necessarily

122
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:32,270
because we are more open society I think

123
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:34,400
it's more<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the FBI has been caught a</font>

124
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:36,859
few times but the end result is that

125
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:38,239
<font color="#E5E5E5">we've learned a lot more about law</font>

126
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:40,580
enforcement hacking in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> United States</font>

127
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:42,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">than many other countries have and I</font>

128
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:46,039
think there are many lessons that can be

129
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:48,560
learned by what has happened in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> US</font>

130
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:50,480
even if you're not<font color="#CCCCCC"> an</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> American</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> alright</font>

131
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:52,070
so what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the point of this talk</font>

132
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:54,200
this is not<font color="#CCCCCC"> at all i'm going to give you</font>

133
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:57,110
the history of<font color="#E5E5E5"> law enforcement hacking</font>

134
00:05:54,200 --> 00:06:00,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">this is not a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk we're going to</font>

135
00:05:57,110 --> 00:06:03,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">describe in real intimate detail how the</font>

136
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:05,690
technology of government malware works

137
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:08,030
the purpose of this talk is really to

138
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:10,760
advance the debate around<font color="#CCCCCC"> law</font>

00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:18,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">probably five or six years ago that the</font>

141
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:20,840
FBI had a dedicated team of hackers<font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font>

142
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:23,600
instinct was that I didn't like it but

beyond sort of the initial ick factor<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

144
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:28,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">took me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> awhile</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to figure out why I</font>

145
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:29,990
didn't like the idea of the government

146
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:32,630
having the ability to control people's

147
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:34,550
webcams or microphones or break into

148
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:35,300
their mobile phones or laptops<font color="#E5E5E5"> and steal</font>

information

150
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:41,030
it took me a while to come up with my

151
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:43,040
own feelings my own arguments and the

152
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:45,830
unfortunate thing is that many<font color="#E5E5E5"> people in</font>

153
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:48,440
civil society in trying to push back

00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:50,750
against government hacking authority

155

00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:57,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's been focused on protecting the</font>

we have against government hacking is

would like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see laws passed if we</font>

would like to see restrictions on

government hacking or even a prohibition

175
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:41,960
on it<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have to come up with arguments</font>

176

that politicians and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the public will</font>

180
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:54,350
this talk is to begin the process of

181
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:58,550
reframing the debate around government

00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:18,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">through about I think six different</font>

189
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:20,960
areas where hacking causes problems and

190
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:24,260
and the goal really of this talk is to

191
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:27,469
equip you and to equip those who will

192
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:30,229
continue this debate with arguments that

193
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:32,690
will actually work so that if you're

194
00:08:30,229 --> 00:08:34,218
seated with someone who thinks that you

195
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:35,180
know hacking<font color="#CCCCCC"> pedophile seems like a</font>

196
00:08:34,219 --> 00:08:36,289
really good idea

197
00:08:35,179 --> 00:08:39,348
you can come up with convincing

198
00:08:36,289 --> 00:08:41,210
arguments as to why even again in those

199
00:08:39,349 --> 00:08:42,710
circumstances it's not a good idea

200
00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:46,339
so the first problem with<font color="#E5E5E5"> law</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">enforcement hacking is secrecy when I</font>

215

in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> United States and around the</font>

sophisticated<font color="#E5E5E5"> formerly military tools</font>

224
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:47,290
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think at this point many people</font>

225
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:49,359
have probably heard of stingrays or as

226
00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:51,759
they're known in<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> europe pmc</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> catchers</font>

that were first designed for the

military and the intelligence community

230
00:09:55,209 --> 00:09:59,258
and have trickled down to state and

231
00:09:56,829 --> 00:10:02,380
local law enforcement<font color="#E5E5E5"> so this phenomenon</font>

232
00:09:59,259 --> 00:10:05,319
has really been described quite well by

235
00:10:07,389 --> 00:10:14,259
phenomenon really is the militarization

of police<font color="#CCCCCC"> the fact that sophisticated</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">eventually trickles down to law</font>

240
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:25,569
enforcement and the problem with this is

241
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:28,180
that it's not just the tools<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

00:10:40,209 --> 00:10:44,680
local law enforcement<font color="#CCCCCC"> but because this</font>

250

<font color="#CCCCCC">say the same technology remains in use</font>

both in the military intelligence

community and in law enforcement

253
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:54,490
it also comes with a cloud of secrecy

254
00:10:51,189 --> 00:10:57,759
that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> law enforcement tries to keep</font>

everything about their use of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> kind</font>

this is again not a theoretical

let's assume that it's a firefox

624
00:25:50,470 --> 00:25:55,720
economics of hacking is that if the

<font color="#E5E5E5">surveilling it becomes the cheapest way</font>

of spying on people<font color="#CCCCCC"> write two or three</font>

629
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:07,399
officers can conduct<font color="#CCCCCC"> these operations</font>

and<font color="#E5E5E5"> hat</font>

631

thousands tens of thousands or hundreds

of thousands of targets<font color="#E5E5E5"> and as long as</font>

633
00:26:12,019 --> 00:26:15,950
the operation happens in a relatively

short period of time<font color="#E5E5E5"> they'll be able to</font>

638
00:26:23,210 --> 00:26:32,210
is that when they<font color="#CCCCCC"> had enough people</font>

surveillance become so cheap<font color="#E5E5E5"> it becomes</font>

640
00:26:32,210 --> 00:26:37,009
cheaper than a hacking becomes cheaper

641
00:26:34,789 --> 00:26:38,989
than even a single hour of<font color="#E5E5E5"> law</font>

642
00:26:37,009 --> 00:26:41,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">enforcement</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> over time that this will</font>

643
00:26:38,989 --> 00:26:43,909
become the tool of first resort<font color="#E5E5E5"> hacking</font>

00:26:43,909 --> 00:26:49,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">they reach for before they go undercover</font>

646
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:50,989
before they try and convince someone<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">old-fashioned way</font>

648
00:26:50,989 --> 00:26:55,070
my concern is a hacking is making spying

649
00:26:53,839 --> 00:26:57,019
far too cheap

650
00:26:55,070 --> 00:26:58,879
alright so that's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> economic</font>

conference and this is a community of

nerds

852
00:34:54,489 --> 00:35:00,910
let's talk about how tech can restrict

854
00:35:00,910 --> 00:35:06,848
job of increasing the security of the

856
00:35:06,849 --> 00:35:10,869
our devices more hardened if we make our

857
00:35:09,010 --> 00:35:12,609
software more secure than it will be

858
00:35:10,869 --> 00:35:14,740
more difficult for governments the<font color="#E5E5E5"> hack</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">they will have to spend more money and</font>

really hurt them

862
00:35:17,829 --> 00:35:23,319
so one of the big problems in this space

863
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:25,540
is that the privacy software we use is

864
00:35:23,319 --> 00:35:28,240
often such a soft target

865
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:30,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's so it in many ways the privacy</font>

866
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:32,439
software is often more vulnerable than

867

regular off-the-shelf software and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

868
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:37,359
really think there's no better example

00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:38,980
than firefox<font color="#CCCCCC"> I i think this photograph</font>

917
00:37:33,470 --> 00:37:39,830
and google has spent a huge sum of money

just not make legislation that says they

1283
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:25,670
the first is that there was a public

debate<font color="#E5E5E5"> at least in my country about</font>

whether or not the police<font color="#CCCCCC"> when and why</font>

1286
00:53:27,619 --> 00:53:30,500
the police should have the ability to

<font color="#E5E5E5">search</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> houses that debate took</font>

00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:37,010

1295
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:49,098
that we got laws passed and there's a

on technical solutions to social

1461

01:00:31,050 --> 01:00:36,120
think that perhaps we should find a

engage in and to actually change the

<font color="#E5E5E5">yeah</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I think that's a fantastic point</font>

extremely important and an often

01:01:21,270 --> 01:01:26,890
overlooked in the US for example<font color="#E5E5E5"> the FBI</font>

1488
01:01:24,870 --> 01:01:28,450
came up with their own special term

01:01:26,890 --> 01:01:31,118
<font color="#E5E5E5">our which is called a network</font>

in court or in briefs the government

1493
01:01:35,589 --> 01:01:38,140
freaks out

1494
01:01:36,190 --> 01:01:40,450
they said no no malware is something

01:01:38,140 --> 01:01:42,009
that criminals use when we do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

used by a bank robber

1500
01:01:50,170 --> 01:01:53,829
it's still a gun<font color="#E5E5E5"> the the person who's</font>

1501
01:01:52,210 --> 01:01:57,010
holding it doesn't change the physical

1502
01:01:53,829 --> 01:01:58,839
object but the Department of Justice has

1503
01:01:57,010 --> 01:02:01,660
contorted themselves into a strange

1504
01:01:58,839 --> 01:02:03,250
shape to insist that their malware is

1505
01:02:01,660 --> 01:02:04,480
not really malware because a judge who

1506
01:02:03,250 --> 01:02:08,440
didn't really understand what she was

redefining the term malware<font color="#CCCCCC"> the first is</font>

1511
01:02:15,039 --> 01:02:20,200
that many judges who are being given

1512
01:02:17,170 --> 01:02:21,549
applications for hacking warrant may not

1513
01:02:20,200 --> 01:02:23,470
really understand what they're being

asked to<font color="#E5E5E5"> authorize when it uses this</font>

clinical<font color="#CCCCCC"> made-up term you know until two</font>

years ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> a google search for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> network</font>

1518
01:02:30,250 --> 01:02:34,240
nothing<font color="#CCCCCC"> and so a judge encountering one</font>

1519
01:02:32,769 --> 01:02:36,939
of these applications for the first time

1520
01:02:34,240 --> 01:02:38,589
<font color="#CCCCCC">we have no way of knowing really what</font>

1521
01:02:36,940 --> 01:02:41,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">they were being asked to authorize and</font>

1522
01:02:38,589 --> 01:02:44,500
still to this day you don't see you know

anywhere in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the warrant application</font>

1525
01:02:46,359 --> 01:02:50,650
and so they really use this<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">clinical language to make it seem like</font>

1527
01:02:50,650 --> 01:02:54,519
what they're doing is<font color="#CCCCCC"> is really not a</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">big deal doesn't have any risks they</font>

1529
01:02:54,519 --> 01:02:59,769
don't talk about what happens if they

1530

make a mistake<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think that's</font>

01:02:59,769 --> 01:03:03,250
really useful when it comes to

1532
01:03:01,450 --> 01:03:04,390
convincing judges or at least making

1533
01:03:03,250 --> 01:03:06,099
sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that judges don't know what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they're</font>

being asked<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> authorize and then</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

1535
01:03:06,099 --> 01:03:11,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">think yeah that also impacts that the</font>

1536
01:03:08,890 --> 01:03:13,420
political debate when there is one<font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

1537

community needs to do a better job of

using language in our in our<font color="#E5E5E5"> favor and</font>

1539
01:03:18,339 --> 01:03:21,819
we unfortunately often<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the</font>

government<font color="#CCCCCC"> you define the terms and then</font>

1541
01:03:21,819 --> 01:03:26,950
we use their terms whether it's you know

1542
01:03:24,160 --> 01:03:28,629
the the increased adoption of sort of

intelligence community terms into<font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

think they're cool but then we<font color="#CCCCCC"> miss</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>
