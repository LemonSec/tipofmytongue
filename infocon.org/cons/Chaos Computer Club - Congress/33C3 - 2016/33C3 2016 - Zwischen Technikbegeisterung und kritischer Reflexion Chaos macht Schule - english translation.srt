I don't want to talk about that right

266
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:10,070
now but instead i want to show that in

267
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:13,700
order to understand this digital world

use computers in their everyday life or

in their work but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's this is an</font>

though the the word that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I like to use</font>

is<font color="#E5E5E5"> digital digital adulthood</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe which</font>

is the fact that you can make your own

transfer this concept to digital<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font>

there to be able to understand that you

285
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:29,600
need to really understand the digital

but it also includes especially when

288
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:47,540
right now when we hear politicians talk

289
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:50,180
about digital<font color="#E5E5E5"> loss</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what we ask is</font>

290
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:52,700
whether they actually have understood

291
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:54,890
the technology behind it but that's even

292
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:58,340
not enough<font color="#CCCCCC"> what we actually need is</font>

293
00:19:54,890 --> 00:20:01,880
someone who understands how the internet

294
00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:05,179
works beyond the technology as such

295

how does the internet work<font color="#E5E5E5"> how does the</font>

transmit my messages or whose interests

are standing behind the drivers of

299
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:27,710
political discussions right now so these

300
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:30,680
questions of what happens in the digital

301
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:38,360
world<font color="#CCCCCC"> we think are also very important</font>

302
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:40,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">and once you're able to judge that then</font>

303
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:43,639
you can actually be an active

304
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:47,900
participant and change the digital world

305
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:50,210
and there's a number of ways where you

306
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:52,190
can change the world

307
00:20:50,210 --> 00:20:54,710
now you don't need to study<font color="#CCCCCC"> IT in order</font>

308
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:58,010
to do that

309
00:20:54,710 --> 00:21:01,040
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> course that's one way but if you code</font>

310
00:20:58,010 --> 00:21:03,710
something yourself or if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> set up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> club</font>

311
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:08,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">by yourself</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or if you do buy funk by</font>

00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:11,630
yourself<font color="#E5E5E5"> but you can also as an artist</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">use technology in your paintings in your</font>

314
00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:17,840
sculptures or even use technology for

315
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:23,000
political and societal discussions<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

316
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:25,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">we want to show that there's different</font>

317
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:30,200
ways of using this digital world and<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

changing the<font color="#E5E5E5"> state</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> real</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> world so for us</font>

00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:38,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">this digital adulthood means being open</font>

320
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:41,059
for technology understanding<font color="#E5E5E5"> the digital</font>

321
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:44,990
world but also questioning the digital

322
00:21:41,059 --> 00:21:48,529
world doesn't need to be like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

323
00:21:44,990 --> 00:21:51,710
also to get an idea of how to change the

324
00:21:48,529 --> 00:21:55,279
digital world<font color="#E5E5E5"> in technology</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in ethics</font>

325
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:57,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">and whatever</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's something that I</font>

326
00:21:55,279 --> 00:22:01,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">think that we think everyone should have</font>

327
00:21:57,500 --> 00:22:03,799
in order to be a digital adult<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we</font>

328
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:08,120
think that we can contribute to this

329
00:22:03,799 --> 00:22:10,490
actively we've done quite a lot of

330
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:12,830
theory so far we've shown you why we

331
00:22:10,490 --> 00:22:14,330
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know why we do what we do but</font>

332
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:16,428
now we want to show you some more

333
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:19,189
concrete<font color="#E5E5E5"> example some projects that were</font>

334
00:22:16,429 --> 00:22:26,029
actually doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> when we go into schools</font>

335
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:29,210
and what we do with these students one

336
00:22:26,029 --> 00:22:35,419
example this is a web interface of open

337
00:22:29,210 --> 00:22:37,940
data city and this can actually show us

338
00:22:35,419 --> 00:22:42,830
how does the internet actually work

339
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:46,760
this is very basic<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get a general idea</font>

340
00:22:42,830 --> 00:22:52,309
of how the internet works to get to be

341
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:54,230
able to contribute to discussions when

342
00:22:52,309 --> 00:22:56,090
talking to students about the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet</font>

343
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:58,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">one thing that we've noticed is that</font>

344
00:22:56,090 --> 00:23:00,918
<font color="#CCCCCC">they're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually pretty enthusiastic</font>

345
00:22:58,789 --> 00:23:07,039
about the internet this is their reality

346
00:23:00,919 --> 00:23:08,600
this is the world that they live in<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

347
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:13,030
this is also something<font color="#E5E5E5"> for them where</font>

348
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:16,120
they can say well

349
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:18,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">yeah make cuts between the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> generation of</font>

350
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:20,439
young generation and the generation to

351
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:22,179
their<font color="#CCCCCC"> present parents</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but if yours what</font>

352
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:25,450
do you know exactly about the internet

353
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:27,160
they normally don't know much about it

354
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:29,230
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet for them is like a big</font>

355
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:36,220
black box they don't know what's going

356
00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:38,740
on in the box itself many really<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

357
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:40,360
know that when they're using a

358
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:42,460
smartphone app<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're usually</font>

359
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:45,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">communicating with the server that's</font>

360
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:50,470
located somewhere maybe in<font color="#CCCCCC"> China maybe</font>

361
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:52,210
in the US and that when you do something

362
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:55,330
on your smartphone it might not actually

363
00:23:52,210 --> 00:23:59,680
happen locally on your smartphone<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

364
00:23:55,330 --> 00:24:02,320
can't really imagine<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're in the</font>

365
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:05,980
internet<font color="#E5E5E5"> a message will be transmitted</font>

366
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:07,600
to and from<font color="#E5E5E5"> whether it's going to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font>

367
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:10,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">smartphone to another smartphone</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> twist</font>

368
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:11,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">to another smartphone or something they</font>

369
00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:13,540
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know</font>

370
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:18,700
so one way to deal with that is to do

371
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:22,780
some visualizations<font color="#CCCCCC"> so in this open data</font>

372
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:27,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">city</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you can use different kinds of</font>

373
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:29,710
interfaces<font color="#E5E5E5"> to to show young kids how</font>

374
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:34,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">routing works</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so at the moment we in</font>

375
00:24:29,710 --> 00:24:37,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">Germany</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and click on this website and</font>

376
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:40,990
now our daughter has to be transported

377
00:24:37,630 --> 00:24:43,180
to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> server server and our</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> computer</font>

380
00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:56,500
rooting to<font color="#CCCCCC"> America and back</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so in the</font>

381

huge cables and everything is working

really really fast<font color="#E5E5E5"> and if you show these</font>

384
00:25:01,210 --> 00:25:08,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">show the kids these really really basic</font>

385
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:11,770
things in this really easy<font color="#E5E5E5"> on his</font>

386
00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:15,880
website like you can click on all the

00:25:11,770 --> 00:25:20,830
links in there and and every way every

388

<font color="#E5E5E5">way is of course a different so from</font>

time to time these signals<font color="#CCCCCC"> are traveling</font>

00:25:22,870 --> 00:25:32,870
out of our continent

391
00:25:24,290 --> 00:25:35,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">weather is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so now we have to answer the</font>

00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:37,489
question what's happening<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you send</font>

00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:52,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">a one example so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i have done this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sort</font>

yes it can<font color="#CCCCCC"> and and she finds that was</font>

404
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:18,220
really bad and<font color="#CCCCCC"> there was no what you</font>

407
00:26:23,930 --> 00:26:31,460

408
00:26:27,230 --> 00:26:34,910
she did not agree to this<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this shows</font>

409
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:38,000
the approach that we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> we want to</font>

clear to them<font color="#CCCCCC"> we make it very simple for</font>

412
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:56,750
them of course but when we<font color="#E5E5E5"> explain the</font>

413
00:26:53,690 --> 00:26:58,250
technology in a very basic way<font color="#E5E5E5"> we often</font>

414
00:26:56,750 --> 00:27:01,520
don't have to explain the problem

419
00:27:17,030 --> 00:27:26,930

420
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:30,290
saving of data we are explicitly asked

421
00:27:26,930 --> 00:27:33,530
about this and it's very difficult to

422
00:27:30,290 --> 00:27:39,080
share with people

423
00:27:33,530 --> 00:27:42,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">why</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's problematic that data is saved</font>

537
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:53,640
they form their own opinions based on

538
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:57,410
these questions when we give them good

539

often this person was online in this

time<font color="#E5E5E5"> we don't usually distinguish</font>

between the red and blue line<font color="#E5E5E5"> but we</font>

576
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:26,390
just ask them to<font color="#E5E5E5"> analyze what they see</font>

577
00:38:20,450 --> 00:38:30,470
the first thing they see is that this

578
00:38:26,390 --> 00:38:32,029
person sleeps at night<font color="#E5E5E5"> so from midnight</font>

579
00:38:30,470 --> 00:38:36,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">till five or six a.m.</font>

00:38:32,030 --> 00:38:38,119
he's not active in<font color="#CCCCCC"> wats app</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

581
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:41,690
think that she would probably be

582
00:38:38,119 --> 00:38:47,839
sleeping in this time so we can see<font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font>

583
00:38:41,690 --> 00:38:51,680
does<font color="#E5E5E5"> this person get up and this graph</font>

584
00:38:47,839 --> 00:38:54,500
is most is highest at 9pm so this is the

585
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:56,930
time when he or she has free time and

586
00:38:54,500 --> 00:39:01,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">we'll be communicating with their</font>

587
00:38:56,930 --> 00:39:03,589
friends and then in between<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

588
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:08,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> workday it looks</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like it</font>

589
00:39:03,589 --> 00:39:12,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">because you can see there's like a break</font>

590
00:39:08,330 --> 00:39:13,130
between 12 and 1pm so probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> lunch</font>

591
00:39:12,140 --> 00:39:19,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">break</font>

592
00:39:13,130 --> 00:39:21,410
what we see is that even though we only

593
00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:24,470
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> one information about this person</font>

594
00:39:21,410 --> 00:39:28,700
when they are online<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can actually see</font>

595
00:39:24,470 --> 00:39:30,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">his</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> scheduled for an entire day just</font>

596
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:32,330
from this and students can actually see

597
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:35,480
that which is very surprising to them

598
00:39:32,330 --> 00:39:38,098
and then we<font color="#CCCCCC"> asked them how do they think</font>

599
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:39,720
their own graph looks like

600
00:39:38,099 --> 00:39:41,489
and they say well in the morning we

601
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:43,348
usually are not online because we're at

602
00:39:41,489 --> 00:39:46,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">school</font>

603
00:39:43,349 --> 00:39:49,079
obviously we always laugh about that

604
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:50,848
because we know that they probably

605
00:39:49,079 --> 00:39:59,309
aren't saying the truth because the

606
00:39:50,849 --> 00:40:01,349
teacher is in there<font color="#E5E5E5"> and from that they</font>

607
00:39:59,309 --> 00:40:06,779
actually understand that everyone can

608
00:40:01,349 --> 00:40:10,890
see this data and they think this is

609
00:40:06,779 --> 00:40:13,289
pretty scary to see that just from

610
00:40:10,890 --> 00:40:20,970
having a phone number everyone out there

611
00:40:13,289 --> 00:40:22,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">can see their day</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> their</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> schedule and</font>

612
00:40:20,970 --> 00:40:25,890
students they often are active all day

613
00:40:22,650 --> 00:40:29,819
they once they get up they<font color="#E5E5E5"> turn on their</font>

614
00:40:25,890 --> 00:40:31,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">smartphone and then one thing that they</font>

615
00:40:29,819 --> 00:40:36,420
see is that this person doesn't really

616
00:40:31,799 --> 00:40:46,140
sleep that much<font color="#E5E5E5"> he or she only sleeps</font>

617
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:48,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">4-5</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hours and students notice and then</font>

618
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:51,239
we can ask them do you think this person

619
00:40:48,690 --> 00:40:55,829
can work productively<font color="#CCCCCC"> when he or she</font>

620
00:40:51,239 --> 00:41:04,200
only sleeps<font color="#E5E5E5"> 4 45 hours or is it good to</font>

621
00:40:55,829 --> 00:41:07,680
drive a car at this point<font color="#E5E5E5"> and what</font>

622
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:08,910
happens if someone sleeps too little for

623
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:14,879
years on end

624
00:41:08,910 --> 00:41:16,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">oh he might become ill and then we can</font>

625
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:18,779
tell them that there's someone who might

626
00:41:16,410 --> 00:41:21,058
be interested in this data<font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe someone</font>

627
00:41:18,779 --> 00:41:24,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">let</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe an employer might want to know</font>

628
00:41:21,059 --> 00:41:28,019
whether his employee works<font color="#E5E5E5"> to sleeps too</font>

629
00:41:24,630 --> 00:41:31,559
little and actually might be more print

630
00:41:28,019 --> 00:41:34,078
<font color="#E5E5E5">prone to become ill so this is more of</font>

an<font color="#E5E5E5"> very practical example that we show</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">though</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more on the technical side</font>

in social networks and the white cards

and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ideas that children will see</font>

650
00:42:53,710 --> 00:43:01,119
this differently and then we might do it

651
00:42:57,819 --> 00:43:07,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">and there are also differences among the</font>

children themselves and they<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk then</font>

with one another about<font color="#E5E5E5"> why would you</font>
