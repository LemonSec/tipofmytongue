00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,340
our next presentation comes from a man

3
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:20,010
who is from Great Britain but now lives

4
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:23,010
in Greece now I don't know if he just

5
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:24,420
tried to escape the bad weather and

6
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:27,060
Britain or the brexit but we're sure

7
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:30,240
happy he made all the way here to

8
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:35,699
Hamburg today thanks now the latest

9
00:00:35,699 --> 00:00:38,819
elections in the US and the referendum

10
00:00:38,819 --> 00:00:41,789
on the breakfast have shown us that with

11
00:00:41,789 --> 00:00:45,449
all the collected data and technology

12
00:00:45,449 --> 00:00:48,870
that we use to break the outcome of such

13
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:53,850
elections we can do it we cannot really

14
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:57,059
know everything or predict everything a

15
00:00:57,059 --> 00:01:00,629
new Dark Age is an exploration of what

16
00:01:00,629 --> 00:01:02,999
we cannot no longer know about this

17
00:01:02,999 --> 00:01:05,339
world and what we can do about this our

18
00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:08,880
speaker James here as an artist a

19
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,480
publisher and a writer and his writings

20
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,280
have appeared in magazines and

21
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,500
newspapers all around the world such as

22
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:21,030
wired the observer and the Guardian he's

23
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:25,250
also a very experienced lecturer in

24
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:27,470
conferences in universities and

25
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:30,060
different events so we're very happy

26
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,280
he's here today so please welcome him

27
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:35,090
and give him a warm round of applause

28
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:38,540
James bridle

29
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,610
hello thank you very much for that

30
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:47,300
introduction

31
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:49,820
thank you very much having me thank you

32
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:51,170
all very much for coming here this is

33
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:52,760
huge and amazing and I'm very grateful

34
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:57,830
and I was yeah I just put hello there

35
00:01:57,830 --> 00:01:59,870
rather new Dark Age because I didn't

36
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:01,520
want it sound quite so frightening at

37
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,400
the outset and I'm not like it's a thing

38
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,470
I'm working on at the moment and I was

39
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:08,119
also asked today to still talk a bit

40
00:02:08,119 --> 00:02:09,710
broadly about some of the work that I do

41
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:11,540
so a lot of this is going to be like a

42
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:15,170
bit mimimi and that I'm gonna show some

43
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:17,600
things I've made as a way of explaining

44
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:20,150
the way that I think through technology

45
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:21,560
and society and various stuff around

46
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,360
that and hopefully there'll be

47
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,430
connections through that and I'll stalk

48
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:27,680
quite a lot about one particular project

49
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,340
I did this year and then some kind of

50
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:34,190
extrapolations from that to kind of

51
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:37,370
where I think I and perhaps we need to

52
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:40,580
be thinking next and I actually my

53
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:42,350
background is as a computer scientist

54
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:45,350
but I'm a seriously lapsed one I managed

55
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:46,370
to graduate with a master's degree

56
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:47,630
without actually learning to program

57
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:49,489
which tells you everything you need to

58
00:02:49,489 --> 00:02:52,130
know about CS education in the UK and

59
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:53,750
has since been trying to teach myself

60
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:55,850
desperately ever since and really badly

61
00:02:55,850 --> 00:02:58,340
but I've also been a literary publisher

62
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:00,110
and a journalist and number of other

63
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:02,750
things but it was my kind of background

64
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:04,459
in publishing and my interest in the web

65
00:03:04,459 --> 00:03:06,860
that sort of got me slowly moving

66
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:09,260
towards the place I'm in now which is

67
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:11,270
increasingly in the art world but always

68
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:15,350
always crossing over and this is a good

69
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:17,780
example of the kind of way I put things

70
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:19,730
together which is a few years old now

71
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:23,000
but there's one of his work he's a

72
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,890
publisher but wanted to start to talk to

73
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:27,530
people about how technology and the

74
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:29,090
Internet in particular changed the way

75
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:30,410
in which we were putting knowledge

76
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:33,280
together and so what I did was I took

77
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,290
the complete history of a single

78
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:37,670
Wikipedia article I took the entire

79
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:40,070
changelog of it which was the article on

80
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:41,780
the Iraq war which at the time I made

81
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:45,709
this book was it was about seven years

82
00:03:45,709 --> 00:03:47,930
of data on a single Wikipedia article

83
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:50,000
and because I was working a publisher at

84
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,260
the time I learned how to make books

85
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:53,870
properly so I typeset it all it's all in

86
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:56,060
like neat little three columns quite

87
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:56,819
small tight

88
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:58,829
but when I had that all print and bound

89
00:03:58,829 --> 00:04:01,560
that single Wikipedia article changelog

90
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:05,519
took a 12 volume size so that the scale

91
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:08,790
of an a powerful old-style encyclopedia

92
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:11,310
and what I was thinking through this

93
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:15,530
work is the fact that the way in which

94
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:18,839
we build stuff with technology doesn't

95
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:21,269
really necessarily change the world's

96
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:22,919
often but the way we understand how that

97
00:04:22,919 --> 00:04:25,500
technology functions changes the way in

98
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,030
which we can interact with the world and

99
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:29,190
so this is still an old-school

100
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:31,710
encyclopedia Wikipedia is still an

101
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:33,360
old-style encyclopedia but the

102
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,310
technology we've built that underlies it

103
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:37,289
allows us to put that together in a way

104
00:04:37,289 --> 00:04:39,150
that allows us to see all the changes we

105
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:40,770
made to it we can see the fact that

106
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:43,889
encyclopedias are not final statements

107
00:04:43,889 --> 00:04:44,430
of fact

108
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:47,190
but processes of argument overtime with

109
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:49,199
many many many voices contributing to

110
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:51,030
them it's a machine for historiography

111
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:53,340
rather than for history and that for me

112
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:54,780
captures something quite fundamentally

113
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:56,340
different about the way we're capable of

114
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:58,889
building stuff today and so my projects

115
00:04:58,889 --> 00:05:01,259
go back and forth between like things

116
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:03,990
that exist as big solid objects which

117
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:06,270
are kind of quite easy to understand and

118
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:09,289
more kind of immaterial software things

119
00:05:09,289 --> 00:05:12,330
this was a project that I ran for three

120
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:14,300
and a half years on various social media

121
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:17,400
tracking reports of drone strikes so I

122
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,800
was working with journalists from place

123
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:22,380
like the Bureau of invested

124
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:26,130
don't strikes in undeclared theatres of

125
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:28,110
war so these were the covert ones in

126
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:30,690
Pakistan and the Yemen in Somalia these

127
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:33,060
reports were being posted and those who

128
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:34,289
are kind of interested in them could

129
00:05:34,289 --> 00:05:36,330
find out slightly more about them but it

130
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:37,949
struck me as deeply strange that this

131
00:05:37,949 --> 00:05:39,930
entire war was going on

132
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:42,990
without images which is deeply strange

133
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:45,090
in our current times I mean and for a

134
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:46,680
long time for more than a century we've

135
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,449
they used to send illustrators to

136
00:05:48,449 --> 00:05:49,860
battlefields right with pencils and

137
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:51,810
papers and an age of mass media was

138
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:53,849
saturated with images there was this

139
00:05:53,849 --> 00:05:56,430
whole war going on without them and yet

140
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:58,770
at the same time we spent the last 10 20

141
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:00,750
years photographing the entire Earth

142
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:03,060
from space you can pull out your phone

143
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:05,250
and look into any spots on the Earth's

144
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:07,860
surface and I wanted to pull those kind

145
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:10,050
of infrastructures together to close

146
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:10,529
those

147
00:06:10,529 --> 00:06:12,359
loop's so every time there was one of

148
00:06:12,359 --> 00:06:13,949
these covert drone strikes reported I

149
00:06:13,949 --> 00:06:16,529
went to a digital mapping service used

150
00:06:16,529 --> 00:06:19,199
various ones to find as close as I could

151
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:20,969
the actual landscape in which that

152
00:06:20,969 --> 00:06:23,159
occurred it's kind of resupply some of

153
00:06:23,159 --> 00:06:26,569
these images back to this ongoing fight

154
00:06:26,569 --> 00:06:29,069
and I'd post those to Instagram to

155
00:06:29,069 --> 00:06:30,329
Twitter to tumblr as these long

156
00:06:30,329 --> 00:06:32,819
sequences and trying to create a kind of

157
00:06:32,819 --> 00:06:34,499
a visual record of what was occurring

158
00:06:34,499 --> 00:06:36,569
one of the good things that happened is

159
00:06:36,569 --> 00:06:38,969
that in these images started to then be

160
00:06:38,969 --> 00:06:41,759
used in other places so media when

161
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:43,619
discussing drone strikes instead of just

162
00:06:43,619 --> 00:06:45,569
running like a photo of a predator drone

163
00:06:45,569 --> 00:06:48,119
supplied to them by the US military

164
00:06:48,119 --> 00:06:50,159
would actually show images of the places

165
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:51,689
where these things were kering the

166
00:06:51,689 --> 00:06:53,489
actual landscapes in that we're kind of

167
00:06:53,489 --> 00:06:56,219
talking about here and that attempt to

168
00:06:56,219 --> 00:06:59,099
make these kind of hard to see I don't

169
00:06:59,099 --> 00:07:01,079
want to say invisible because you can

170
00:07:01,079 --> 00:07:03,959
always see thanks Ingrid and I don't

171
00:07:03,959 --> 00:07:05,699
want to say that but these hard to see

172
00:07:05,699 --> 00:07:07,319
things kind of more visible I take that

173
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:08,819
kind of out into the real world as well

174
00:07:08,819 --> 00:07:10,859
so for several years I've been doing

175
00:07:10,859 --> 00:07:14,789
these drone shadow works which are

176
00:07:14,789 --> 00:07:17,219
one-to-one realizations and that came of

177
00:07:17,219 --> 00:07:19,110
me just wanting to know more about these

178
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:21,209
big machines a thing which I'm very

179
00:07:21,209 --> 00:07:22,829
unlikely to ever see in the real world

180
00:07:22,829 --> 00:07:25,769
but I have you know the tools to find

181
00:07:25,769 --> 00:07:28,019
out just the size of it right just a

182
00:07:28,019 --> 00:07:29,819
simple thing like that and go and put

183
00:07:29,819 --> 00:07:31,409
that out in the street where people can

184
00:07:31,409 --> 00:07:33,149
actually see and kind of measure oneself

185
00:07:33,149 --> 00:07:34,949
physically against the thing it really

186
00:07:34,949 --> 00:07:36,869
changes the way people see and

187
00:07:36,869 --> 00:07:38,610
understand these things and I've painted

188
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:41,219
these all over the world and is totally

189
00:07:41,219 --> 00:07:43,079
open sourced it so there's a guide

190
00:07:43,079 --> 00:07:45,299
online to drawing your own and people

191
00:07:45,299 --> 00:07:46,709
have then subsequently taken that and

192
00:07:46,709 --> 00:07:49,309
done it both has art installations and

193
00:07:49,309 --> 00:07:51,539
protests in all these kind of and I just

194
00:07:51,539 --> 00:07:52,709
get like people sending me pictures

195
00:07:52,709 --> 00:07:53,909
occasionally when these things have

196
00:07:53,909 --> 00:07:55,889
appeared around the world which is

197
00:07:55,889 --> 00:07:58,979
amazing it's very simple to just set out

198
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:00,839
to draw a thing in order to understand

199
00:08:00,839 --> 00:08:03,239
it and then realize a whole bunch of

200
00:08:03,239 --> 00:08:07,499
stuff by doing that physical action what

201
00:08:07,499 --> 00:08:09,089
the drone shadows really emphasize is

202
00:08:09,089 --> 00:08:11,009
actually the the intentional

203
00:08:11,009 --> 00:08:13,019
invisibility of these things the fact

204
00:08:13,019 --> 00:08:15,239
that they're designed not to be seen not

205
00:08:15,239 --> 00:08:17,099
to be seen you know physically because

206
00:08:17,099 --> 00:08:18,809
they fly so high they're invisible but

207
00:08:18,809 --> 00:08:20,209
not to be seen politically as well

208
00:08:20,209 --> 00:08:22,649
because because they automate systems

209
00:08:22,649 --> 00:08:24,050
that would otherwise

210
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:26,370
lead to body bags and all the reasons

211
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:29,750
you know the military's like drones and

212
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:32,490
and that got me into the habit of doing

213
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:34,110
other things in the street as well and

214
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:36,750
this is a rainbow plane that I drew in

215
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:39,179
Ukraine a couple of years ago if you've

216
00:08:39,179 --> 00:08:41,400
spent half as much time as I have on

217
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,169
Google Maps you might have seen the

218
00:08:43,169 --> 00:08:45,960
rainbow planes that kind of I find them

219
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:48,420
deeply beautiful I find them if you're

220
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:50,010
scouting around airports or whatever you

221
00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:52,050
might spot these things in Google Maps

222
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:53,580
and what they are are they're artifacts

223
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:56,220
of satellite mapping so the satellite is

224
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:57,960
passing very fast overhead taking images

225
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:00,270
as the ground the planes are flying very

226
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:03,060
fast below them and the thing is that

227
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:05,760
satellites don't see like human see and

228
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,260
this is the point at which I become

229
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:08,430
fascinated because I'm interested in

230
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:11,100
seeing how technology sees the world in

231
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,930
fundamentally different ways than we do

232
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:15,900
and satellites see using a variety of

233
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:18,630
sensors both visible spectrum red green

234
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:22,140
blue and in a high-definition black and

235
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:24,720
white in this case and deepens the

236
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,700
infrared in the ultraviolet so they see

237
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,290
things that we're not capable of seeing

238
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:31,320
and this these little glitches are very

239
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,060
interesting because they allow us to

240
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:35,550
glimpse inside that system and see the

241
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:37,410
way in which the machine is seeing the

242
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:39,840
world and attempt to kind of reflect

243
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:43,710
that back by by making them visible and

244
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:45,060
addressable and kind of pointing these

245
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:46,740
things out in this way it makes us

246
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:49,080
possible to to think about them for me

247
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:52,620
in slightly different ways and a couple

248
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:55,560
of years ago I did this project in South

249
00:09:55,560 --> 00:10:00,690
London and this was called the right to

250
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:02,730
flight and this is on top of a

251
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:04,290
multi-story car park in South London

252
00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:08,400
where we built these silos one of which

253
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:11,220
is a hangar for this blimp the blimps

254
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:12,420
kind of amazing it's a thing called

255
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:15,090
helicase which is a hybrid of a balloon

256
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:17,190
and a kite invented by a slightly mad

257
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:18,930
British guy who I had to spend several

258
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:21,900
days in the pub with and the helico it's

259
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:23,700
amazing because it's better than both

260
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:26,220
balloon and kite it has helium to lift

261
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:28,890
and but also a kite to fight the wind so

262
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:30,090
it doesn't get blown down like a normal

263
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:31,650
balloon but it has much more lift than a

264
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:35,010
regular kite and I was flying it off

265
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:37,710
this rooftop to kind of investigate

266
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:40,320
what it was like to be able to have that

267
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,420
view from above that kind of classic

268
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:44,640
surveillant God's eye view of the world

269
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,080
how would it feel for me to be able to

270
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:48,990
make kind of aerial images like this to

271
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:53,220
to become to to access this airspace

272
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:55,620
above London that was otherwise kind of

273
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:58,350
heavily restricted and and it was a

274
00:10:58,350 --> 00:10:59,940
beautiful project it ran for several

275
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:02,220
months but it also waded me out quite a

276
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:04,680
large extent and because obviously the

277
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,000
first thing I did was whack a camera on

278
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,040
this thing because aerial photos are

279
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,390
beautiful and I want to see all this

280
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:11,760
stuff from above and very quickly I

281
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,320
started to become really uncomfortable

282
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,810
with that because I was doing

283
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:19,170
surveillance essentially and I was while

284
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:21,000
I try to inform people what I was doing

285
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,020
and I I looked at various ways doing I

286
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:26,670
kind of released the footage openly so

287
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:28,140
everyone see the probe the products of

288
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:29,190
what I was doing and this kind of stuff

289
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:32,040
no one actually cared okay

290
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,900
this is in part London is not really

291
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:37,430
giving a about anything but also I

292
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:40,740
whether it's just a and lack of

293
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:41,790
awareness of the thing or whether it's

294
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:43,650
just the fact that London is so subject

295
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:45,300
to surveillance all the time anyway and

296
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:48,120
this is kind of off people's minds but I

297
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,890
was the responsibility was entirely on

298
00:11:49,890 --> 00:11:53,490
me to stop doing this essentially that I

299
00:11:53,490 --> 00:11:54,780
suddenly got to a point what I couldn't

300
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:57,540
make any more images like this and I

301
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:58,830
realized that in many ways it's quite

302
00:11:58,830 --> 00:12:00,330
hard to make artworks about surveillance

303
00:12:00,330 --> 00:12:01,800
that don't essentially do more

304
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,900
surveillance and that's a really bad

305
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:06,210
pattern to get into because I don't

306
00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:07,770
think it helps I think it just kind of

307
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:09,480
reinforces the logics of surveillance

308
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:12,810
and normalizes it for people and so I

309
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:14,280
stopped myself I took the cameras off

310
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:16,290
and end up putting like a kind of pirate

311
00:12:16,290 --> 00:12:17,880
box on there so people could share that

312
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:21,330
felt like a more useful kind of

313
00:12:21,330 --> 00:12:23,340
relationship to have with it and so I

314
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:24,300
started looking at more kind of

315
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:26,010
pedagogical ways to talk about these

316
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:29,340
things like this project which is called

317
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:33,800
citizen X which is a browser extension

318
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:37,380
very simply anyone can download it

319
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:38,790
tracks your browsing but entirely

320
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:41,640
privately data doesn't leave it I don't

321
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,940
share it with anyone including myself

322
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:46,650
but as you're browsing the web you can

323
00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:47,880
hit the button and it will pull down

324
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:50,130
will show you very simply stuff that's

325
00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:51,470
very simple for most people in this

326
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:53,960
I'm sure where the internet thinks you

327
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:57,320
are and where the Internet thinks the

328
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:59,210
website you're visiting is so it shows

329
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:01,010
you this relationship of the the

330
00:13:01,010 --> 00:13:02,450
physical infrastructure of the internet

331
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:04,430
and like many artists I've been kind of

332
00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:05,720
investigating the physical

333
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:06,740
infrastructure of the internet for a

334
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:08,660
while and thinking it's important to

335
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:10,130
sort of point at this stuff and go you

336
00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:12,350
know this magic cloud place you hear

337
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:14,570
about isn't some faraway strange place

338
00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:16,190
it's like it's a real thing it's here

339
00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:18,230
it's large buildings filled with

340
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:21,080
computers in legal jurisdictions subject

341
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:24,110
to certain laws and but but there's

342
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:25,640
there's weirdest stuff going on under

343
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:27,590
that as well so with this project I

344
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:29,210
didn't just want to highlight that

345
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:31,550
physical Internet I wanted to highlight

346
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:33,110
what that physical Internet does to your

347
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:35,510
rights which is in this case based on

348
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:37,780
NSA documents showing how the NSA

349
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:40,700
assigned citizenship and what the NSA

350
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:43,160
does is it and when it's pulling in all

351
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:45,200
that data it looks at your browsing

352
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,360
habits and it says well based on where

353
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,800
this person is going on the Internet and

354
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,240
the sort of behavior they have there's

355
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,740
this percentage likelihood they're

356
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:53,810
American because that's an important

357
00:13:53,810 --> 00:13:56,270
determinant for the NSA because they're

358
00:13:56,270 --> 00:13:58,430
supposed to not track Americans so they

359
00:13:58,430 --> 00:14:00,680
have to have some mechanism for making

360
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:02,960
this distinction so moment by moment

361
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:05,810
online your citizenship which used to be

362
00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:07,700
this really solid thing that used to be

363
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:09,200
a thing determined by your passport by

364
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,180
your place of birth that you could prove

365
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:14,030
those of us who are lucky to hold stable

366
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:15,620
citizenships you could prove with a

367
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:18,650
document that's no longer the case your

368
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:20,050
right to privacy is being determined

369
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:23,330
algorithmically all the time by tracking

370
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:25,460
of your behavior and so what's it's an X

371
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:28,790
does is it looks at your your very

372
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:31,490
simple behaviors online and it builds

373
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:32,840
you one of these algorithm exists and

374
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:35,150
chips to say this is what actually your

375
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:37,820
web browsing behavior would look like if

376
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:40,220
someone more nefarious was looking at it

377
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:42,170
and how that might kind of come to

378
00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:46,910
affect your rights and I was looking at

379
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:48,380
the sky a while back because I was

380
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:49,700
looking for these planes which are

381
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:52,850
covert Metropolitan Police surveillance

382
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:54,980
planes and hang out in fields quite a

383
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:56,570
lot looking for weird stuff like this

384
00:14:56,570 --> 00:15:00,500
and what I found instead was was these

385
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:03,560
flights this is an example of where I

386
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:05,080
got into fields and stare at the sky

387
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:08,620
and find myself stood next to a bunch of

388
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:10,810
kind of weird interesting people because

389
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:12,370
you end up in the fields around airports

390
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:14,530
with the plane spotters the chem

391
00:15:14,530 --> 00:15:16,630
trailers and activists working on

392
00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:18,700
various subjects and working with a

393
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:21,100
bunch of activists on tracking

394
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:24,310
deportations from the UK this is a the

395
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:25,870
system the British government uses to

396
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:28,930
deport people which is basically where

397
00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:31,630
they hire private planes because it got

398
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:34,290
embarrassing to do it on on a general

399
00:15:34,290 --> 00:15:37,900
general usual aircraft and in the middle

400
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:39,340
of the night they put people onto these

401
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:41,530
planes and they fly them out the country

402
00:15:41,530 --> 00:15:43,210
and this is a very hard system to see

403
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:44,950
because it happens in the middle of the

404
00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:47,020
night at private terminals airports it

405
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:49,060
happens within closed courtrooms and

406
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:52,480
within privatized detention centers and

407
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:55,840
so working with some friends of mine who

408
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:56,920
are architects and architectural

409
00:15:56,920 --> 00:16:01,360
modelers we used planning commissioners

410
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,310
went to the council we got the files on

411
00:16:03,310 --> 00:16:04,630
these kind of places we did these kind

412
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,280
of classic invert vesti of journalism

413
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:09,790
practices of finding eyewitness accounts

414
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:12,820
finding council documents visiting and

415
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:14,350
sketching places where we could where we

416
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:15,970
weren't allowed to photograph in order

417
00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:18,490
to visualize them so this is a courtroom

418
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:20,080
in the centre of London in the UK it's

419
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,780
illegal to photograph courtrooms so

420
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:24,160
there's no photographs exist of this

421
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,620
space but there are very very shiny

422
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:28,390
architectural visualizations that we

423
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:30,430
made of it this is an interesting

424
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:32,140
courtroom because it's a courtroom in

425
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:35,680
which special laws apply the UK passed a

426
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,260
special law for immigrants appeals

427
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:40,300
commissions where there's suspicion of

428
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:42,010
terrorist activity or some kind of

429
00:16:42,010 --> 00:16:44,200
security risk where they can present

430
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,480
secret evidence which is evidence that

431
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,460
the defendant and their legal team are

432
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:49,840
not allowed to know about it makes a

433
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,280
complete mockery of the idea of a fair

434
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:53,110
trial and what's interesting is the way

435
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:55,210
in that the way in which that appears as

436
00:16:55,210 --> 00:16:57,310
architecture in spaces like this because

437
00:16:57,310 --> 00:16:59,170
you can actually point to it the divider

438
00:16:59,170 --> 00:17:01,330
on the left here is what separates the

439
00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:02,980
public viewing gallery from the spooks

440
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:05,500
viewing gallery and the closed witness

441
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,060
box over there is so that members of the

442
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:09,490
security personnel can scoot service can

443
00:17:09,490 --> 00:17:10,510
appear without giving away their

444
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:15,540
identities and this culminated in a

445
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:17,579
eight minute film you can watch online

446
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:19,650
called seamless transitions which

447
00:17:19,650 --> 00:17:23,609
documents these these various spaces

448
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:25,859
that the courtroom which you just saw a

449
00:17:25,859 --> 00:17:27,420
detention center near Heathrow Airport

450
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:29,970
and the final airport through which

451
00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:32,010
people are deported which is Stansted if

452
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:35,420
anyone goes to the UK on holiday and and

453
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:38,010
what what again I was trying to do in

454
00:17:38,010 --> 00:17:42,450
this these this film was not necessarily

455
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:46,230
paint like just the what you would

456
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:48,270
traditionally do with photojournalism so

457
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:49,080
this was commissioned by the

458
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:51,120
photographers gallery in London and and

459
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:54,420
it was when it first went on show there

460
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:58,050
it was alongside a huge amazing deep

461
00:17:58,050 --> 00:17:59,880
dives to the archive of something called

462
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,230
the black star archive which is an

463
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:02,730
archive of human rights photography from

464
00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:04,560
the 20th century it's extraordinary

465
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,600
but it's very much what you think of

466
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,010
when you think of of 20th century

467
00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:09,000
photojournalism

468
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,280
which is the kind of sharp

469
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,380
black-and-white photo a face in a crowd

470
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:15,480
this frozen moment this moment from

471
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:17,520
which we can supposedly draw like this

472
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:20,490
particular story this one signal thing

473
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:23,340
which will explain everything else and

474
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:25,560
it's and it's a fantastic way of working

475
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:27,180
but in this site I kind of realized I

476
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:28,860
was doing the opposite which is I was

477
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:30,420
using the architecture of these spaces

478
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:33,300
and also the way in which work like this

479
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:35,400
is put together which is hugely based on

480
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,950
research assemblage cooperating with

481
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:41,070
other artists visualizers and also

482
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:42,680
cooperating with the software

483
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,640
architectural software that makes this

484
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,560
is the same software that generates a

485
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:48,240
huge amount of the built environment

486
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:51,390
around us and yet we still kind of

487
00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:53,730
assume there's one master architect at

488
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:55,200
the heart of one of these things rather

489
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,090
than several thousand people working on

490
00:18:57,090 --> 00:18:59,520
code or AutoCAD or whoever it is who now

491
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,960
have a huge stake in our built

492
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,460
environment so all of these different

493
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:04,350
pressures come into play on trying to

494
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:06,900
depict not a particular place but the

495
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:09,960
entire legal and infrastructural system

496
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:12,030
that goes into creating the situation

497
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:14,310
that results which is horrific

498
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:18,750
deportation system so that's a very

499
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:21,450
brief and swift run-through of some of

500
00:19:21,450 --> 00:19:23,370
the sort of things I do

501
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:26,330
I wanted to talk a little bit more about

502
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:31,559
about this project the cloud index which

503
00:19:31,559 --> 00:19:33,059
requires a little bit of history which I

504
00:19:33,059 --> 00:19:37,020
hope will be interesting this is this is

505
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:38,400
one of my favorite people Lewis fry

506
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:44,340
Richardson and in 1912 13 Richardson was

507
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:46,559
a meteorologist who was working the

508
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,750
Eskimo Deer Observatory in Scotland

509
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:51,030
doing a very very early kind of weather

510
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:52,950
calculation mostly just recording the

511
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:54,750
weather and trying to like think about

512
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:56,880
what it might mean to start to have this

513
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,340
kind of huge body of weather data and

514
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:01,470
then in 1914 he was called up for the

515
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:04,140
First World War and he was a Quaker so

516
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:05,429
he's a pacifist so he joined the

517
00:20:05,429 --> 00:20:08,300
ambulance division and spent the war and

518
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:11,220
running around with stretchers the other

519
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:12,929
thing he spent the war doing was that

520
00:20:12,929 --> 00:20:15,030
he'd taken a bunch of data a bunch of

521
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:16,920
readings from the observatory and from

522
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,360
other observatories around Europe that

523
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:20,090
had been gathering before the war and

524
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:22,610
over the course of two to three years

525
00:20:22,610 --> 00:20:25,320
during the war while in trenches well

526
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:27,420
under fire he performed the very first

527
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:29,550
mathematical calculation were 24-hour

528
00:20:29,550 --> 00:20:32,370
weather forecasts just over the area of

529
00:20:32,370 --> 00:20:34,260
northern Europe just over the area that

530
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:36,750
you see here but he figured out what the

531
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:38,970
mass was to take a bunch of historical

532
00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:42,150
weather data and advance that 24 hours

533
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:45,510
right to push that prediction forward

534
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:46,860
into the future which is an incredible

535
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:48,179
achievement and I say it took him

536
00:20:48,179 --> 00:20:49,920
several years to do this with pencils

537
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:53,190
and paper and when he analyzed the

538
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:54,690
results because obviously the day he was

539
00:20:54,690 --> 00:20:56,910
doing was by that stage almost a decade

540
00:20:56,910 --> 00:20:58,620
into the past he turned out to be

541
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:00,929
broadly correct some things were bit

542
00:21:00,929 --> 00:21:02,910
more exaggerated whatever but it but his

543
00:21:02,910 --> 00:21:06,690
his kind of an his thesis worked and

544
00:21:06,690 --> 00:21:08,040
because of course this was a time before

545
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:11,820
what we now think of as computers he

546
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:13,080
didn't he thought this was a kind of

547
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:15,210
achievement but thought realizing its

548
00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:17,040
full potential was a very long way off

549
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:22,260
and he in the in this book the one that

550
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:24,240
showed before he goes on this kind of

551
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,429
beautiful little fantasy where he

552
00:21:26,429 --> 00:21:28,350
describes what it would take for his

553
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:31,170
weather forecasting to actually achieve

554
00:21:31,170 --> 00:21:32,940
some kind of industrial scale and be

555
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:35,250
economically useful this is a painting

556
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:37,110
of that fantasy

557
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:41,990
by Steven Conlan from 1986 where he hung

558
00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:45,420
Richardson described this vast globe on

559
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:47,549
the inside of which will be painted a

560
00:21:47,549 --> 00:21:49,320
huge grid covering the entire Earth

561
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:51,420
which weather forecasters could kind of

562
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:54,630
point to read data off calculate it have

563
00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:56,580
it replaced you can see there be teams

564
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:58,770
of mathematicians then still called

565
00:21:58,770 --> 00:22:00,510
computers working in the middle and then

566
00:22:00,510 --> 00:22:02,130
this kind of amazing infrastructure of

567
00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:05,460
information Telegraph's and all the kind

568
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:07,830
of communications infrastructure of the

569
00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:09,960
age pouring information into this place

570
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,809
and pouring it back out again

571
00:22:11,809 --> 00:22:14,580
and so this was he knew it was possible

572
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:16,169
but he thought you know mankind would

573
00:22:16,169 --> 00:22:18,720
never actually get to the point that it

574
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:21,090
would possible and mankind did get to

575
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:25,950
that point in in 1950 when the very

576
00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:30,360
first mechanical calculation of a

577
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:32,610
24-hour weather forecast was performed

578
00:22:32,610 --> 00:22:35,850
and which was done on the ENIAC which is

579
00:22:35,850 --> 00:22:36,840
a computer that some of you have

580
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:39,270
probably heard of which is my personally

581
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:42,720
favorite computer and the first stored

582
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,790
first mechanical stored program computer

583
00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:47,520
built in the 1940s the University of

584
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:51,240
Pennsylvania and this is the process for

585
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:53,490
doing it and they brought together a

586
00:22:53,490 --> 00:22:55,230
team of meteorologists in in kind of

587
00:22:55,230 --> 00:22:58,230
from 1948 onwards and in 1950 they ran

588
00:22:58,230 --> 00:23:00,390
this very very first calculation or the

589
00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:02,400
very first successful calculation of a

590
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,350
single day's weather forecasting over

591
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:08,940
the northern United States and when they

592
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:11,070
did it it took about three weeks to run

593
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:14,220
right which doesn't sound so great but

594
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:15,600
you have to remember that the ENIAC

595
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:19,559
broke down a lot of the time and what

596
00:23:19,559 --> 00:23:21,090
they realized was that actually if they

597
00:23:21,090 --> 00:23:23,549
subtracted all the time when the machine

598
00:23:23,549 --> 00:23:25,290
hadn't been running from the process

599
00:23:25,290 --> 00:23:27,390
they got it down to 23 hours and 30

600
00:23:27,390 --> 00:23:29,460
minutes so they had very for the very

601
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:31,830
first successfully time calculated the

602
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:33,600
weather faster than the weather itself

603
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:36,919
was happening right this is a incredibly

604
00:23:36,919 --> 00:23:39,030
significant moment and john von neumann

605
00:23:39,030 --> 00:23:41,040
who worked on this project wrote in the

606
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:43,080
in the project log that we have achieved

607
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:44,900
the dreams of Lewis fry Richardson

608
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:47,160
computation now advances faster than the

609
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:49,530
weather itself and I like the fact that

610
00:23:49,530 --> 00:23:50,260
it happened on the

611
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:52,300
yak which as I say is my favorite

612
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:53,770
computer for those who aren't familiar

613
00:23:53,770 --> 00:23:58,960
with it and here it is it was a you know

614
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:02,350
an early mainframe so occupied two huge

615
00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:03,730
rooms first at the University of

616
00:24:03,730 --> 00:24:06,820
Pennsylvania and later at the Plymouth

617
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:09,030
proving grounds aberdeen proving grounds

618
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:12,070
where it's moved after the war and it

619
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:13,480
was you know it required a lot of

620
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:15,460
fiddling and plugging in and if you've

621
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:18,370
read chewings cathedral which is a great

622
00:24:18,370 --> 00:24:20,320
book about the kind of history of the

623
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,090
early kind of computational programs

624
00:24:22,090 --> 00:24:23,890
there's a beautiful quote in that from a

625
00:24:23,890 --> 00:24:26,290
guy called Harry Reid who was a engineer

626
00:24:26,290 --> 00:24:28,900
who worked on this computer in which he

627
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:30,970
says that um I always thought of the

628
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:33,340
ENIAC is a very personal computer now we

629
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:34,660
think of a personal computer as

630
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:36,070
something we kind of carry around with

631
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:37,990
us but the ENIAC was a computer that you

632
00:24:37,990 --> 00:24:41,680
lived inside right it completely

633
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:44,140
surrounded you and actually for me like

634
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:45,970
that that division of personal computer

635
00:24:45,970 --> 00:24:47,380
is obviously and I think increasingly

636
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:50,560
not true because we all live inside this

637
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:52,690
kind of shell of computation now we know

638
00:24:52,690 --> 00:24:54,690
that these are mostly terminals to other

639
00:24:54,690 --> 00:24:57,310
other connections whoever owns them

640
00:24:57,310 --> 00:24:58,630
whether we build these things outwards

641
00:24:58,630 --> 00:24:59,860
or not whether we're talking to

642
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:01,780
satellites or not the ENIAC hasn't

643
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:03,130
contracted into these things has

644
00:25:03,130 --> 00:25:05,230
actually expanded out into a kind of

645
00:25:05,230 --> 00:25:08,350
vast shell around us and the other thing

646
00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:09,520
that I really like about the ENIAC is

647
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:11,130
you know it's one of these computers

648
00:25:11,130 --> 00:25:13,600
this generation of computers were the

649
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,910
last ones that were kind of truly

650
00:25:15,910 --> 00:25:18,700
physically legible so computation now is

651
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:21,100
legible to those of us probably not me

652
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:24,130
who are really smart enough to kind of

653
00:25:24,130 --> 00:25:27,100
follow logically step by step what kind

654
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:28,600
of process is happening within machines

655
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:30,100
with the ENIAC you could do that

656
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:31,870
physically with your eyes by looking at

657
00:25:31,870 --> 00:25:33,670
the blinking lights so that you could

658
00:25:33,670 --> 00:25:35,800
watch a computation kind of unfold on

659
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:38,800
you across the walls you could actually

660
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:41,380
see that as it went from different parts

661
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:42,820
of the machines through the through the

662
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:44,110
architecture you could kind of follow

663
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:46,450
that and that kind of legibility also

664
00:25:46,450 --> 00:25:48,220
seems to me something quite crucial to

665
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:51,670
kind of go back to and reflect on as I

666
00:25:51,670 --> 00:25:52,750
mentioned one of the people who worked

667
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:55,180
on that was a john von neumann who i'm

668
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:56,500
sure you're most familiar with is the

669
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:58,750
kind of invent of the von neumann

670
00:25:58,750 --> 00:26:00,100
architecture works on a lot of these

671
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:01,960
early projects and obviously was working

672
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,210
on both

673
00:26:03,210 --> 00:26:05,649
the weather project but also on the

674
00:26:05,649 --> 00:26:07,090
Manhattan Project because this is here

675
00:26:07,090 --> 00:26:09,580
with with Oppenheimer who run the

676
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:12,130
Manhattan Project and the same computer

677
00:26:12,130 --> 00:26:14,559
the ENIAC was used for both the weather

678
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:17,679
forecasting programs and for the

679
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:19,600
development of nuclear bombs these are

680
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:22,179
the kind of two grand computational arms

681
00:26:22,179 --> 00:26:25,149
races that really kind of got computing

682
00:26:25,149 --> 00:26:28,570
going in the 1940s and 50s and von

683
00:26:28,570 --> 00:26:31,450
Neumann had this line which which he

684
00:26:31,450 --> 00:26:32,830
divert which he wrote first in the

685
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:36,250
commentary on on the atomic on the

686
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:38,470
weather project but later recycled to

687
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:40,389
talk about the Manhattan Project which

688
00:26:40,389 --> 00:26:42,370
was kind of his view of what computation

689
00:26:42,370 --> 00:26:44,409
could do and particularly computational

690
00:26:44,409 --> 00:26:45,850
prediction and he said that all the

691
00:26:45,850 --> 00:26:47,860
stable processes we shall predict and

692
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:49,779
all under stable processes we shall

693
00:26:49,779 --> 00:26:51,639
control and that was his view of what

694
00:26:51,639 --> 00:26:53,799
you could do with computation you could

695
00:26:53,799 --> 00:26:55,149
model and control the world's a

696
00:26:55,149 --> 00:26:56,860
sufficient degree that you could predict

697
00:26:56,860 --> 00:27:03,039
the outcomes so I wanted to to take some

698
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:04,480
of those ideas of the weather and our

699
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,279
computational predictive abilities and

700
00:27:06,279 --> 00:27:08,529
bring them somewhat up to date and I was

701
00:27:08,529 --> 00:27:10,450
I got particularly fascinated with them

702
00:27:10,450 --> 00:27:11,950
what's currently happening in neural

703
00:27:11,950 --> 00:27:15,730
networks because I studied and you know

704
00:27:15,730 --> 00:27:17,970
studies see us awhile back I studied AI

705
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:21,940
in the like early noughties but

706
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:23,500
basically the AI of the 90s that was

707
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:26,110
dying so we were taught neural networks

708
00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:28,539
as a kind of historical anomaly like a

709
00:27:28,539 --> 00:27:30,549
nice idea some interesting theory but

710
00:27:30,549 --> 00:27:32,919
basically a dead end and the field kind

711
00:27:32,919 --> 00:27:34,899
of went quiet for 10 years and it's just

712
00:27:34,899 --> 00:27:36,909
starting to go kind of massive again

713
00:27:36,909 --> 00:27:38,769
right the last 5 years newer networks

714
00:27:38,769 --> 00:27:42,460
have become as AI starting to kind of

715
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:44,769
become inside everything essentially in

716
00:27:44,769 --> 00:27:46,450
rather interesting ways and so I thought

717
00:27:46,450 --> 00:27:47,889
was important to kind of really eight

718
00:27:47,889 --> 00:27:49,659
them and explore them again and this is

719
00:27:49,659 --> 00:27:54,730
from a paper from the beginning of this

720
00:27:54,730 --> 00:27:57,909
year things move fast in this world of

721
00:27:57,909 --> 00:28:01,149
Facebook research paper about DC ganz

722
00:28:01,149 --> 00:28:03,639
deep conversation deep convolutional

723
00:28:03,639 --> 00:28:06,279
generational adversarial networks which

724
00:28:06,279 --> 00:28:07,480
is something that they've been they've

725
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:09,850
been pushing and using and this is from

726
00:28:09,850 --> 00:28:12,580
a newer network generation from that

727
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:14,980
paper where they took

728
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:16,960
thousands and thousands of thousands of

729
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:20,529
bedrooms pictures of bedrooms and they

730
00:28:20,529 --> 00:28:22,600
asked this network to simulate new

731
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,700
bedrooms so each of the images you see

732
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:26,679
here is not a bedroom that exists in the

733
00:28:26,679 --> 00:28:29,200
world it's a bedroom that's been dreamed

734
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:32,080
up by a neural network that's seen many

735
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:35,619
many pictures of bedrooms and it's

736
00:28:35,619 --> 00:28:36,820
fascinating to me what we decided to

737
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:41,350
train these things on and and the more

738
00:28:41,350 --> 00:28:44,259
public image of newer networks which is

739
00:28:44,259 --> 00:28:45,759
kind of everyone's a lot of people have

740
00:28:45,759 --> 00:28:48,460
seen is is the deep dream stuff from

741
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:52,059
Google and so what deep dream is is an

742
00:28:52,059 --> 00:28:53,830
attempt to see back through these

743
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:56,109
networks and try and understand how they

744
00:28:56,109 --> 00:28:58,419
think about and make images so it's kind

745
00:28:58,419 --> 00:29:02,200
of instead of asking the the network to

746
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,669
look at an image and tell you what it

747
00:29:03,669 --> 00:29:07,649
sees it's asking it basically gives it

748
00:29:07,649 --> 00:29:10,960
blank or or fixed images and I'll sit to

749
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,549
kind of reverse them back through that

750
00:29:12,549 --> 00:29:14,019
network to kind of imagine and visualize

751
00:29:14,019 --> 00:29:16,330
what it can see in the world and it

752
00:29:16,330 --> 00:29:17,679
turns out those things are terrifying

753
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:19,899
and I think I think this should be

754
00:29:19,899 --> 00:29:24,249
acknowledged more and when deep the the

755
00:29:24,249 --> 00:29:25,720
guys on the machine learning team at

756
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:27,450
Google first came up with deep dream

757
00:29:27,450 --> 00:29:29,799
apparently they showed it to Google PR

758
00:29:29,799 --> 00:29:31,179
and we're like look what we made

759
00:29:31,179 --> 00:29:35,590
and PR was like never release that and

760
00:29:35,590 --> 00:29:37,629
in fact they weren't allowed to they did

761
00:29:37,629 --> 00:29:40,869
the dream leaked first of all and I

762
00:29:40,869 --> 00:29:42,249
don't know how but it's interesting and

763
00:29:42,249 --> 00:29:44,049
and then they had to come out and say

764
00:29:44,049 --> 00:29:46,059
okay this is what this thing is and

765
00:29:46,059 --> 00:29:48,190
everyone went war man computer tripping

766
00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:51,429
balls and didn't and didn't you know

767
00:29:51,429 --> 00:29:54,070
there hasn't been a huge amount and I

768
00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:56,139
know I don't think like you know the

769
00:29:56,139 --> 00:29:58,029
people behind there that are quite

770
00:29:58,029 --> 00:29:59,230
annoyed that there hasn't actually been

771
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:00,549
a bit more thinking about what this kind

772
00:30:00,549 --> 00:30:04,269
of stuff entails because it's what

773
00:30:04,269 --> 00:30:05,799
neural networks are doing in the world

774
00:30:05,799 --> 00:30:08,950
is kind of interesting and you can do

775
00:30:08,950 --> 00:30:10,419
weird stuff with neural networks and

776
00:30:10,419 --> 00:30:12,519
visual new interaction DC games a

777
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:14,109
particular list from the same paper so

778
00:30:14,109 --> 00:30:15,639
you can do addition and subtraction you

779
00:30:15,639 --> 00:30:17,559
can take a bunch of images associated

780
00:30:17,559 --> 00:30:20,230
with certain concepts you can then

781
00:30:20,230 --> 00:30:23,619
produce new images that combine elements

782
00:30:23,619 --> 00:30:25,809
of those things so this is a network

783
00:30:25,809 --> 00:30:27,340
that's never seen a picture of a smiling

784
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:29,170
man but is seen

785
00:30:29,170 --> 00:30:32,320
these other distinct stages and you can

786
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,150
do other take on that to produce new

787
00:30:34,150 --> 00:30:36,280
kinds of image outcomes as I thought

788
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:37,660
well if a computer can dream of bedrooms

789
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:39,100
and it can dream of smiling men it can

790
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:40,600
dream of all things and it can possibly

791
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:47,380
also dream of the weather so I took you

792
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:48,400
might have noticed from the other works

793
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:49,420
I'm quite obsessed with satellite

794
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:53,170
imagery so I took 8 years of satellite

795
00:30:53,170 --> 00:30:55,600
data of weather over the UK this is from

796
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:59,800
the EU space programs meteo sat which

797
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:02,170
sits up there well above null Island

798
00:31:02,170 --> 00:31:04,570
watching the earth every day several

799
00:31:04,570 --> 00:31:07,480
images a day of weather systems over the

800
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:09,970
Western Hemisphere and chop that down

801
00:31:09,970 --> 00:31:13,000
into images over the UK which came to

802
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,830
about 16,000 images which I stressed is

803
00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:16,330
really not enough for doing this kind of

804
00:31:16,330 --> 00:31:18,820
work but I only had 8 years of data on

805
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:21,370
the other input which was polling data

806
00:31:21,370 --> 00:31:23,470
from the UK on their voting intentions

807
00:31:23,470 --> 00:31:26,500
in the EU referendum and I'm sorry about

808
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:28,000
brexit I'm not going to speak of that

809
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,560
again except I am because this is what

810
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:31,900
this project is about and this is this

811
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:34,180
is a short snapshot I actually had eight

812
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:36,100
years of polling data it's a bit sparse

813
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:37,480
at the end but it was enough to

814
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:39,820
extrapolator eight years of information

815
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:42,820
and so I built one of these networks

816
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:44,500
with the assistance of Jean Cogan who

817
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:46,540
might be around here somewhere and who's

818
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:51,330
brilliant and fed it eight years of

819
00:31:51,330 --> 00:31:54,670
weather images from space eight years of

820
00:31:54,670 --> 00:31:56,620
images of cloud formations and eight

821
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:59,590
years of this polling data about the EU

822
00:31:59,590 --> 00:32:01,480
referendum and my newer Network dreamed

823
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:03,910
new weather formations it dreamed new

824
00:32:03,910 --> 00:32:06,100
kind of cloud patterns and once it has

825
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:07,030
started to make these kind of

826
00:32:07,030 --> 00:32:07,810
associations

827
00:32:07,810 --> 00:32:10,360
it was then possible to say to it well

828
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:12,370
you've seen what the weather looks like

829
00:32:12,370 --> 00:32:14,620
on these certain occasions when the

830
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:16,210
voting is trending in these particular

831
00:32:16,210 --> 00:32:18,490
directions so just as we did the

832
00:32:18,490 --> 00:32:20,740
addition with the smiling man etc let's

833
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:22,690
do some addition on the voting and say

834
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:24,340
well what should the weather look like

835
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:27,460
if the entire country was to vote in one

836
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:29,080
particular directional or in the other

837
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:32,740
direction to generate weather potential

838
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:36,370
weathers that we could simulate if we

839
00:32:36,370 --> 00:32:37,960
wish the Democratic outcomes to be

840
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:41,020
different and and the ones that the

841
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:42,490
extremes are what they

842
00:32:42,490 --> 00:32:45,400
are actually kind of enjoyed more the

843
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:47,130
outcomes that played around with

844
00:32:47,130 --> 00:32:49,450
undecided voters this seemed to me

845
00:32:49,450 --> 00:32:50,679
actually something that really required

846
00:32:50,679 --> 00:32:54,940
more attention in in the aftermath of

847
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:57,370
you know very divisive elections of the

848
00:32:57,370 --> 00:32:59,230
kind of various kinds that we've seen

849
00:32:59,230 --> 00:33:00,850
this year to try and put a little bit

850
00:33:00,850 --> 00:33:05,020
more emphasis on not on hard brexit or

851
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:07,000
trumpism or whatever it is but on the

852
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,700
huge space within that of indecision and

853
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:12,040
unknowingness that actually guides and

854
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:15,059
hugely influences a lot of our elections

855
00:33:15,059 --> 00:33:17,650
and the reason that I thought that this

856
00:33:17,650 --> 00:33:19,300
would be in part a worthwhile thing to

857
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:21,400
do is because we can change the weather

858
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:24,700
now okay if we if we want to and this is

859
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:27,300
Vincent Schaefer in his laboratory at

860
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:30,040
General Electric in the mid-1950s

861
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:31,510
Vincent Schafer's the man who invented

862
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:34,510
cloud seeding which is the realization

863
00:33:34,510 --> 00:33:38,500
you can place into into early forming

864
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:41,140
clouds crystals are silver iodide that

865
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:43,410
will cause those clouds to precipitate

866
00:33:43,410 --> 00:33:46,660
you can you can you can raise smog

867
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:48,700
levels you can burn off fog you can

868
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:50,830
enact quite large-scale changes to the

869
00:33:50,830 --> 00:33:53,740
atmosphere when Schafer's work started

870
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:56,500
to appear in the 1950s there was a huge

871
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:58,450
public debate in the US and elsewhere

872
00:33:58,450 --> 00:34:01,900
about what the possibilities of weather

873
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:04,750
modification might be there was a huge

874
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:06,220
belief there's a huge military belief

875
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:08,679
that that weather would be the weapon of

876
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:11,109
the future and the u.s. used weather

877
00:34:11,109 --> 00:34:13,418
modification extensively in Vietnam it

878
00:34:13,418 --> 00:34:16,210
had a two-year program of seeding with

879
00:34:16,210 --> 00:34:18,550
silver iodide clouds over the Vietnam

880
00:34:18,550 --> 00:34:21,159
and in order to basically obliterate the

881
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:22,000
Ho Chi Minh Trail

882
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,379
they reckoned they extended the maan

883
00:34:23,379 --> 00:34:25,690
seen soon period by an average of six

884
00:34:25,690 --> 00:34:28,119
weeks each year making it rain more and

885
00:34:28,119 --> 00:34:31,629
more and more and when that leaked again

886
00:34:31,629 --> 00:34:34,989
leaking they stopped it immediately and

887
00:34:34,989 --> 00:34:38,469
there's been little willingness in the

888
00:34:38,469 --> 00:34:40,480
West to continue cloud seeding exponents

889
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,699
ever since then but it doesn't stop

890
00:34:42,699 --> 00:34:45,129
other people these are Chinese weather

891
00:34:45,129 --> 00:34:47,800
making rockets the Chinese government

892
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:51,639
has a weather Department of some 50,000

893
00:34:51,639 --> 00:34:53,409
employees whose job it is to make the

894
00:34:53,409 --> 00:34:56,230
weather and they active very much in

895
00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:58,600
agricultural locations either making it

896
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,070
rain on the crops or preventing it

897
00:35:00,070 --> 00:35:03,220
hailing on crops but they also do a lot

898
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:06,700
of work clearing the air for official

899
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:08,440
parades for the opening of the Olympics

900
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:12,340
for these kinds of events so the weather

901
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:14,800
is is a tool that we could be deploying

902
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,960
should we wish to and one that we might

903
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:17,980
increasingly want to think about

904
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:21,369
deploying in the in the not-too-distant

905
00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:22,990
future when we have to ask ourselves

906
00:35:22,990 --> 00:35:24,580
quite serious questions about what we

907
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:26,200
want to do with the environment how

908
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:28,570
we're willing to use the things that we

909
00:35:28,570 --> 00:35:30,490
know how we wish to use those things

910
00:35:30,490 --> 00:35:33,790
whether we have the strength of our

911
00:35:33,790 --> 00:35:37,330
beliefs in our ability to act in the

912
00:35:37,330 --> 00:35:41,530
world and and why do I do this and and

913
00:35:41,530 --> 00:35:44,500
and it's because I'm no longer convinced

914
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:46,140
actually that it's possible to

915
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:48,900
understand the world just through

916
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:51,040
processing kind of vast amount of

917
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:53,350
information that I don't think this is

918
00:35:53,350 --> 00:35:56,320
any longer proactive useful way of

919
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,420
dealing with the world but I realized

920
00:35:58,420 --> 00:35:59,800
that I kind of wanted to retain the

921
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:03,460
cloud not as a kind of bad metaphor of

922
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:06,070
kind of lost the engineering or

923
00:36:06,070 --> 00:36:08,290
corporate control and not as that kind

924
00:36:08,290 --> 00:36:10,330
of materialist look I found a data cable

925
00:36:10,330 --> 00:36:14,350
kind of like materialization of the

926
00:36:14,350 --> 00:36:16,570
world but but as a way of thinking the

927
00:36:16,570 --> 00:36:19,030
world as recognizing that the cloud is

928
00:36:19,030 --> 00:36:21,850
cloudy that what it reveals to us is

929
00:36:21,850 --> 00:36:23,859
often actually a kind of difference and

930
00:36:23,859 --> 00:36:26,140
differentiation around the world and

931
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:28,030
that is not a purely kind of fixed

932
00:36:28,030 --> 00:36:30,100
channel for information that's there to

933
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:32,410
tell us how the world is but asks us to

934
00:36:32,410 --> 00:36:34,630
question it and thinking think about it

935
00:36:34,630 --> 00:36:37,720
more and this is increasingly necessary

936
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:40,930
because this informational view of the

937
00:36:40,930 --> 00:36:42,280
world this view that by gathering

938
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:43,630
information we kind of make more

939
00:36:43,630 --> 00:36:45,790
knowledge and more sense is increasingly

940
00:36:45,790 --> 00:36:49,630
at risk and I'm sure again Moore's Law

941
00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:51,310
is familiar to most of people in this

942
00:36:51,310 --> 00:36:54,550
room the rule that the number of

943
00:36:54,550 --> 00:36:55,930
transistors doubles every couple years

944
00:36:55,930 --> 00:36:57,550
in Sun space you get more more power

945
00:36:57,550 --> 00:37:00,940
more more processing power this is its

946
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:03,430
inverse this is something that's been

947
00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:05,380
named eroom's law by people who work in

948
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:07,450
the pharmacological sciences this is the

949
00:37:07,450 --> 00:37:09,080
graph of

950
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:11,900
money spent on medical research against

951
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:13,730
drug discovery and it's going the other

952
00:37:13,730 --> 00:37:17,320
way the more money that's put into this

953
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:20,570
the less and less we're learning and

954
00:37:20,570 --> 00:37:23,870
there's various proposals that have been

955
00:37:23,870 --> 00:37:26,930
put forward two obvious analyses of this

956
00:37:26,930 --> 00:37:27,980
which is a long-running and

957
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:29,600
long-standing problem in pharmacology

958
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:31,490
and and one of the most prevalent

959
00:37:31,490 --> 00:37:33,590
theories is is essentially too much

960
00:37:33,590 --> 00:37:35,630
information and if you know how drug

961
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:37,220
discovery has done now it's not

962
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:39,320
basically people in white coats in a lab

963
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:41,210
and it basically looks like a server

964
00:37:41,210 --> 00:37:43,250
farm it looks like large machines it

965
00:37:43,250 --> 00:37:45,110
looks like robots and it looks like very

966
00:37:45,110 --> 00:37:47,300
very large datasets of information being

967
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:49,310
automatically run through these

968
00:37:49,310 --> 00:37:52,700
high-throughput screening machines in

969
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:54,560
order to test new drug reactions against

970
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:58,010
one another and this this problem seems

971
00:37:58,010 --> 00:38:03,860
to be continuing and one of the ways in

972
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:05,390
which science labs are dealing with it

973
00:38:05,390 --> 00:38:07,610
is increasingly putting people back into

974
00:38:07,610 --> 00:38:09,680
the process not as some kind of like

975
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:13,610
airy-fairy you know computers are bad

976
00:38:13,610 --> 00:38:16,190
people a magical kind of way but simply

977
00:38:16,190 --> 00:38:17,920
that there seems to be some other way of

978
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:20,300
thinking the world that doesn't rely on

979
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:22,490
vast vast datasets but I'm plotting

980
00:38:22,490 --> 00:38:24,860
slightly distinct in non machine equate

981
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:28,430
them the example I like of that is is

982
00:38:28,430 --> 00:38:33,080
the story of advanced chess so this is

983
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:37,640
the famous game in 1997 between Kasparov

984
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:40,640
and deep blue when IBM spent a decade

985
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,590
building a computer to built beat this

986
00:38:42,590 --> 00:38:44,660
one poor guy at the only game he'd ever

987
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:49,730
loved and yeah it was you know as this

988
00:38:49,730 --> 00:38:52,160
it was this insane moment because we

989
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:54,110
basically our idea of intelligence is

990
00:38:54,110 --> 00:38:55,850
always like the one thing we're still

991
00:38:55,850 --> 00:38:57,230
holding out and you'll notice in any

992
00:38:57,230 --> 00:38:59,300
discussion of AI that what constitutes

993
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:01,550
intelligence has kind of receded for

994
00:39:01,550 --> 00:39:03,020
decades as the machines have got better

995
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:04,820
and we've got oh no not that this no you

996
00:39:04,820 --> 00:39:06,380
kind of continually moved the barriers

997
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:07,880
but at this point chess was the thing

998
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:09,770
right and it was a really shocking

999
00:39:09,770 --> 00:39:12,590
moment when possibly the greatest chess

1000
00:39:12,590 --> 00:39:15,140
player ever tire of all time was beaten

1001
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:20,840
by this machine and you know deep blue

1002
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:22,489
was it was a brute force

1003
00:39:22,489 --> 00:39:24,289
that's what it did it basically was

1004
00:39:24,289 --> 00:39:28,460
capable of doing such vast search

1005
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:30,440
through the kind of development process

1006
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:33,529
space of the gamers involved that it

1007
00:39:33,529 --> 00:39:36,349
could out think any human by a pure kind

1008
00:39:36,349 --> 00:39:38,029
of brute-force approach of thinking

1009
00:39:38,029 --> 00:39:40,099
ahead and that that ultimately seemed to

1010
00:39:40,099 --> 00:39:41,150
be right we finally built enough

1011
00:39:41,150 --> 00:39:44,930
processors to be too human and and what

1012
00:39:44,930 --> 00:39:46,220
was interesting is that while lots of

1013
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:47,420
people were kind of like oh god and

1014
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:48,979
that's it the machines take over

1015
00:39:48,979 --> 00:39:51,440
Kasparov came back just one year later

1016
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:53,529
with a thing he called advanced chess

1017
00:39:53,529 --> 00:39:56,059
which was a new kind of chess which was

1018
00:39:56,059 --> 00:39:59,479
not humans versus machines but humans

1019
00:39:59,479 --> 00:40:01,269
and machines versus humans and machines

1020
00:40:01,269 --> 00:40:05,029
because it turns out that today in it

1021
00:40:05,029 --> 00:40:05,930
you know and this has become very

1022
00:40:05,930 --> 00:40:11,630
successful and a you know not even a

1023
00:40:11,630 --> 00:40:14,150
supercomputer today advanced computer

1024
00:40:14,150 --> 00:40:15,739
will wipe the floor with any human alive

1025
00:40:15,739 --> 00:40:18,739
but a human using quite a relatively

1026
00:40:18,739 --> 00:40:21,140
weak computer assisted by it will wipe

1027
00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:22,309
the floor with even the biggest

1028
00:40:22,309 --> 00:40:24,589
supercomputer there's a some kind of

1029
00:40:24,589 --> 00:40:27,950
interesting complementary nurse to the

1030
00:40:27,950 --> 00:40:29,839
way in which this thought happens and

1031
00:40:29,839 --> 00:40:32,150
that seems to me one model of how we can

1032
00:40:32,150 --> 00:40:34,009
think about our relationship technology

1033
00:40:34,009 --> 00:40:36,859
not as this kind of completely

1034
00:40:36,859 --> 00:40:38,329
oppositional thing but as a form of

1035
00:40:38,329 --> 00:40:39,739
cooperation and kind of thinking through

1036
00:40:39,739 --> 00:40:43,729
problems together but at the same time

1037
00:40:43,729 --> 00:40:45,559
there's something also that's that's

1038
00:40:45,559 --> 00:40:46,910
coming out of that at the same time

1039
00:40:46,910 --> 00:40:48,710
because this is where we next put

1040
00:40:48,710 --> 00:40:51,619
intelligence right this is into this is

1041
00:40:51,619 --> 00:40:54,079
the alphago game from earlier this year

1042
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:57,229
when google's deepmind again just a

1043
00:40:57,229 --> 00:41:00,619
massive spoilsport machine played Lisa

1044
00:41:00,619 --> 00:41:03,499
doll one of the greatest go players in

1045
00:41:03,499 --> 00:41:06,170
the world and despite a heroic fourth

1046
00:41:06,170 --> 00:41:09,710
game third game for them deep mind one

1047
00:41:09,710 --> 00:41:12,319
and so go is now again one of these

1048
00:41:12,319 --> 00:41:14,509
things that we held up as being such a

1049
00:41:14,509 --> 00:41:17,719
important move intelligence and is now

1050
00:41:17,719 --> 00:41:19,700
kind of you know has again been taken by

1051
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:21,739
the machines and while I really look

1052
00:41:21,739 --> 00:41:23,900
forward to advanced go and all the kind

1053
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:25,369
of interesting things that will come out

1054
00:41:25,369 --> 00:41:27,140
of new ways to play it there's something

1055
00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:28,519
fundamentally different between deep

1056
00:41:28,519 --> 00:41:32,900
mind and deep blue

1057
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:35,090
and that is we don't understand how deep

1058
00:41:35,090 --> 00:41:38,360
blue I'll forego so it does what it does

1059
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:40,520
we don't understand how the newer

1060
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:43,460
network and actually beat these dog

1061
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:44,690
there's theories and there's kind of

1062
00:41:44,690 --> 00:41:46,370
ways of watching the game and picking

1063
00:41:46,370 --> 00:41:48,170
them apart but essentially this was a

1064
00:41:48,170 --> 00:41:50,000
machine that was trained first by a team

1065
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,590
of humans and then trained against

1066
00:41:51,590 --> 00:41:53,840
instances of itself and it's learning

1067
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:55,340
ability while it played against other

1068
00:41:55,340 --> 00:41:57,080
instances itself was kind of exponential

1069
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:59,600
and it's thought processes because it's

1070
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:02,870
in the annual network and the weights

1071
00:42:02,870 --> 00:42:04,160
and train that your network is

1072
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:06,650
unintelligible to us at some kind of

1073
00:42:06,650 --> 00:42:08,420
deep fundamental level we can maybe

1074
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:10,520
produce the kind of weird deep dream

1075
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:13,550
mind state images for alphago but they

1076
00:42:13,550 --> 00:42:16,520
weren't tell us what the the process is

1077
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:21,050
that allows this this to happen every

1078
00:42:21,050 --> 00:42:23,450
what we heard this is the example of the

1079
00:42:23,450 --> 00:42:25,610
strangeness of neural networks I've

1080
00:42:25,610 --> 00:42:27,230
checked this story and it doesn't appear

1081
00:42:27,230 --> 00:42:29,060
to be true but it's the classical story

1082
00:42:29,060 --> 00:42:31,610
of how strange neural networks are and

1083
00:42:31,610 --> 00:42:34,040
why they do things that we can't quite

1084
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:37,160
understand which is em that the US Army

1085
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:40,370
commissioned a neural network to

1086
00:42:40,370 --> 00:42:42,980
recognize tanks they get a team of

1087
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:44,930
researchers a tank a bunch of soldiers

1088
00:42:44,930 --> 00:42:46,370
and they said go and hide in the woods

1089
00:42:46,370 --> 00:42:48,230
take loads of photos feed them into a

1090
00:42:48,230 --> 00:42:50,570
neural network and we wanted neural

1091
00:42:50,570 --> 00:42:52,760
network that can see tanks in the trees

1092
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:54,920
that can see camouflaged artillery and

1093
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:56,690
so and so forth so they went out they

1094
00:42:56,690 --> 00:42:57,860
took those these photos they were back

1095
00:42:57,860 --> 00:43:00,710
to lab they built in and annual Network

1096
00:43:00,710 --> 00:43:03,700
they ran all the images through it and

1097
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:06,950
and it worked perfectly on this kind of

1098
00:43:06,950 --> 00:43:09,170
X thousand images that they had the the

1099
00:43:09,170 --> 00:43:10,790
newer network every time classified yes

1100
00:43:10,790 --> 00:43:12,020
there's a tank in this image no there's

1101
00:43:12,020 --> 00:43:13,160
not even when the tank was like hidden

1102
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:15,350
deep in the trees and invisible as they

1103
00:43:15,350 --> 00:43:16,640
went back to the Army together neural

1104
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:18,320
network and well like he go we've done

1105
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:20,570
it all and the army put its new pictures

1106
00:43:20,570 --> 00:43:22,610
in and it completely failed I didn't

1107
00:43:22,610 --> 00:43:24,710
work at all and the way they went back

1108
00:43:24,710 --> 00:43:26,000
because they were working with a

1109
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,540
relatively small dataset they looked at

1110
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:31,160
the images again and they realized that

1111
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:32,240
the tank had only been there in the

1112
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:34,160
morning and so what the images were the

1113
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:35,390
tank in had been shot in the morning and

1114
00:43:35,390 --> 00:43:36,890
all the images without tanks have been

1115
00:43:36,890 --> 00:43:38,180
certainly afternoon and the neural

1116
00:43:38,180 --> 00:43:39,830
network was really really good

1117
00:43:39,830 --> 00:43:41,150
I work out whether it's morning or

1118
00:43:41,150 --> 00:43:43,670
afternoon and but it completely had

1119
00:43:43,670 --> 00:43:46,190
utterly failed to see tanks

1120
00:43:46,190 --> 00:43:49,400
and these are the kind of strange misses

1121
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:50,840
that occur when using technologies where

1122
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:53,030
we don't quite see the way the machine

1123
00:43:53,030 --> 00:43:56,780
sees the world and we're building neural

1124
00:43:56,780 --> 00:44:00,080
networks into all of our things now this

1125
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:05,180
is Nvidia's program to to train cars to

1126
00:44:05,180 --> 00:44:06,350
drive well they basically just put the

1127
00:44:06,350 --> 00:44:08,120
newer network in the car connected to

1128
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:09,080
all the computers and driven it around

1129
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:10,670
for a while so it learns to recognize

1130
00:44:10,670 --> 00:44:12,230
the world around it without any external

1131
00:44:12,230 --> 00:44:13,670
cues it doesn't know the rules of the

1132
00:44:13,670 --> 00:44:16,040
world rules of the road it doesn't know

1133
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:17,930
what anything else looks like it's just

1134
00:44:17,930 --> 00:44:19,760
watched humans drive for so long it

1135
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:22,550
figures it out for itself these things

1136
00:44:22,550 --> 00:44:25,070
are becoming inside the things around us

1137
00:44:25,070 --> 00:44:28,280
all the time and we're actively building

1138
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:31,040
the tools of our own mystification this

1139
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:32,900
I find particularly strange this is for

1140
00:44:32,900 --> 00:44:34,880
a Google brain experiment just a couple

1141
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:38,510
of months old where they are trained to

1142
00:44:38,510 --> 00:44:40,340
neural networks to hide their

1143
00:44:40,340 --> 00:44:42,980
communications from a third party so

1144
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:46,540
they Alice and Bob in this arrangement

1145
00:44:46,540 --> 00:44:48,170
evolved their own

1146
00:44:48,170 --> 00:44:50,510
cryptographic system to protect their

1147
00:44:50,510 --> 00:44:53,360
communications from Eve and I myself

1148
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:56,000
think it's a really great idea that we

1149
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,380
should train the machines to be able to

1150
00:44:57,380 --> 00:44:59,810
talk in secret behind our backs I think

1151
00:44:59,810 --> 00:45:05,390
this is a struggling to see and see why

1152
00:45:05,390 --> 00:45:10,100
we would want to do this this this idea

1153
00:45:10,100 --> 00:45:12,200
though of course of being able to gather

1154
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:13,640
all the more data about the world making

1155
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:18,410
it to collect everything in order to

1156
00:45:18,410 --> 00:45:19,940
make better decisions is of course one

1157
00:45:19,940 --> 00:45:25,060
that we see across across across domains

1158
00:45:25,060 --> 00:45:28,100
this is the this is the approach of

1159
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:29,990
surveillance agencies this belief that

1160
00:45:29,990 --> 00:45:32,480
by gathering all of the information they

1161
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:33,740
will be able to make better decisions

1162
00:45:33,740 --> 00:45:35,090
they will be able to pull out and they

1163
00:45:35,090 --> 00:45:36,260
will build a model of the world that's

1164
00:45:36,260 --> 00:45:38,480
so complete that they'll have a full

1165
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:40,430
understanding of it on which they will

1166
00:45:40,430 --> 00:45:44,780
be able to act and it strikes me that

1167
00:45:44,780 --> 00:45:48,140
this this is not actually all too

1168
00:45:48,140 --> 00:45:49,820
different from the way in which we also

1169
00:45:49,820 --> 00:45:53,540
oppose this belief that actually the

1170
00:45:53,540 --> 00:45:56,750
belief in information itself being

1171
00:45:56,750 --> 00:45:58,520
somehow sufficient to

1172
00:45:58,520 --> 00:46:03,470
change opinions to to sort of enact some

1173
00:46:03,470 --> 00:46:05,960
greater good naturally on its own behalf

1174
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:10,190
is also the approach of of transparency

1175
00:46:10,190 --> 00:46:14,570
of kind of full information release that

1176
00:46:14,570 --> 00:46:18,350
that the the you know NSA and WikiLeaks

1177
00:46:18,350 --> 00:46:20,330
essentially believe the same thing which

1178
00:46:20,330 --> 00:46:22,760
there is some smoking gun information at

1179
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:24,200
the heart of the world that if we only

1180
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:25,700
bring it to light everything will kind

1181
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:27,830
of magically be made better and that

1182
00:46:27,830 --> 00:46:29,690
that that seems to me to be an

1183
00:46:29,690 --> 00:46:31,610
increasingly insufficient way of viewing

1184
00:46:31,610 --> 00:46:34,610
the world this is an as is a small

1185
00:46:34,610 --> 00:46:36,140
example of Facebook's analysis of hot

1186
00:46:36,140 --> 00:46:38,690
topics for November 2016 with WikiLeaks

1187
00:46:38,690 --> 00:46:41,000
right up there in the old men quadrant

1188
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,820
of most discussed topics from the time

1189
00:46:43,820 --> 00:46:47,030
of the election I'm a big fan of Julian

1190
00:46:47,030 --> 00:46:50,270
Assange's original network analysis

1191
00:46:50,270 --> 00:46:52,940
secrecy that posed the kind of leaking

1192
00:46:52,940 --> 00:46:55,010
as this kind of like grit in

1193
00:46:55,010 --> 00:46:56,510
authoritarian regimes that were kind of

1194
00:46:56,510 --> 00:46:58,220
make them grind to a halt but it does

1195
00:46:58,220 --> 00:47:00,620
appear to me at the moment that right

1196
00:47:00,620 --> 00:47:02,510
now it's kind of merely oiling a machine

1197
00:47:02,510 --> 00:47:04,220
that none of us want to keep running

1198
00:47:04,220 --> 00:47:07,070
that we're locked in a kind of deadlock

1199
00:47:07,070 --> 00:47:11,990
of an information war that we're both

1200
00:47:11,990 --> 00:47:15,110
playing against each other in ways that

1201
00:47:15,110 --> 00:47:16,490
are not going to break us out of this

1202
00:47:16,490 --> 00:47:20,510
this opacity transparency dialectic

1203
00:47:20,510 --> 00:47:25,520
anytime soon and all around us this it

1204
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:28,880
seems to me that it's becoming harder

1205
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:30,830
for these predictive mathematical

1206
00:47:30,830 --> 00:47:32,990
information based systems to work and we

1207
00:47:32,990 --> 00:47:34,130
need to ask very specific questions

1208
00:47:34,130 --> 00:47:37,310
about what that's doing to us and to our

1209
00:47:37,310 --> 00:47:40,840
societies there's a huge fuss around

1210
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:46,880
polling and and the poor performance of

1211
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:48,650
polls both in the referendum and Trump

1212
00:47:48,650 --> 00:47:53,480
and everything else and but but most of

1213
00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:54,800
that seem to focus on the fact that like

1214
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:56,450
the mathematical models were were wrong

1215
00:47:56,450 --> 00:47:57,740
and they'd have to be revised and we

1216
00:47:57,740 --> 00:47:59,300
kind of built better ones rather than

1217
00:47:59,300 --> 00:48:00,470
saying these things are things that

1218
00:48:00,470 --> 00:48:02,510
actually poison the discourse as part of

1219
00:48:02,510 --> 00:48:04,610
the process that when you are running

1220
00:48:04,610 --> 00:48:07,100
polls running metrics running forty

1221
00:48:07,100 --> 00:48:08,720
models like this all of the time

1222
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:10,730
alongside everything you're actually

1223
00:48:10,730 --> 00:48:12,079
shaping the outcomes

1224
00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:14,449
so when polls are done during a campaign

1225
00:48:14,449 --> 00:48:16,249
they don't just say what people are

1226
00:48:16,249 --> 00:48:17,660
going to do at the end they change

1227
00:48:17,660 --> 00:48:19,670
people's behavior during the campaign

1228
00:48:19,670 --> 00:48:22,489
and they also change what is politically

1229
00:48:22,489 --> 00:48:24,619
possible because people run polls and

1230
00:48:24,619 --> 00:48:25,880
they say or people don't like that we're

1231
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:27,049
not even going to put this out into

1232
00:48:27,049 --> 00:48:29,239
public discourse modeling and predicting

1233
00:48:29,239 --> 00:48:31,939
in this way restricts the kind of actual

1234
00:48:31,939 --> 00:48:35,959
possibility of discourse around us the

1235
00:48:35,959 --> 00:48:39,019
debate around fake news is a kind of

1236
00:48:39,019 --> 00:48:41,869
startlingly interesting one but one that

1237
00:48:41,869 --> 00:48:44,209
is not all so historically new or novel

1238
00:48:44,209 --> 00:48:46,369
or should not be and also it needs to be

1239
00:48:46,369 --> 00:48:47,989
I think very specifically historically

1240
00:48:47,989 --> 00:48:50,479
situated as something that as an idea of

1241
00:48:50,479 --> 00:48:52,640
so this suddenly that we can't know this

1242
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:54,769
stuff or that it doesn't emerge from

1243
00:48:54,769 --> 00:48:57,499
quite specific ways of seeing the world

1244
00:48:57,499 --> 00:49:01,880
I was particularly struck and by some of

1245
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:03,799
the reporting in recent weeks that and

1246
00:49:03,799 --> 00:49:07,189
went on and on about and the fake a lot

1247
00:49:07,189 --> 00:49:08,569
of this fake news stuff emerging from

1248
00:49:08,569 --> 00:49:10,039
the former Yugoslavia public of

1249
00:49:10,039 --> 00:49:13,069
Macedonia that's cited it particularly

1250
00:49:13,069 --> 00:49:14,599
in this place without any particular

1251
00:49:14,599 --> 00:49:17,630
context around the political situation

1252
00:49:17,630 --> 00:49:19,670
in that place is possibly being related

1253
00:49:19,670 --> 00:49:20,929
so the story if you don't know it is

1254
00:49:20,929 --> 00:49:22,640
that lots of kids in Macedonia and

1255
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:23,839
particularly apparently in this one town

1256
00:49:23,839 --> 00:49:25,939
of village set up those of these

1257
00:49:25,939 --> 00:49:27,679
websites which were getting more hits on

1258
00:49:27,679 --> 00:49:29,509
Facebook the New York Times only kind of

1259
00:49:29,509 --> 00:49:31,729
additional media by completely making up

1260
00:49:31,729 --> 00:49:33,829
stories and so getting tons and tons of

1261
00:49:33,829 --> 00:49:35,959
ad revenue and it strikes me that this

1262
00:49:35,959 --> 00:49:38,539
is a place in which they have a

1263
00:49:38,539 --> 00:49:39,949
government in Macedonia which for the

1264
00:49:39,949 --> 00:49:42,559
last 10 years has pursued a policy of

1265
00:49:42,559 --> 00:49:44,599
fake news as government policy this is

1266
00:49:44,599 --> 00:49:48,109
part of Skopje 2014 part of the

1267
00:49:48,109 --> 00:49:50,479
Macedonians government project to build

1268
00:49:50,479 --> 00:49:54,910
an entirely fake history for Macedonia

1269
00:49:54,910 --> 00:49:57,380
by erecting statues of Alexander the

1270
00:49:57,380 --> 00:50:00,079
Great and Philip of Macedon and

1271
00:50:00,079 --> 00:50:02,179
classicizing buildings with kind of

1272
00:50:02,179 --> 00:50:03,559
Hellenic columns and this kind of stuff

1273
00:50:03,559 --> 00:50:06,229
in a completely kind a historical move

1274
00:50:06,229 --> 00:50:07,670
that's been opposed by lots of people in

1275
00:50:07,670 --> 00:50:09,559
the country but as a result of a kind of

1276
00:50:09,559 --> 00:50:11,359
huge resurgent nationalism and

1277
00:50:11,359 --> 00:50:13,009
nationalism that actually depends on

1278
00:50:13,009 --> 00:50:16,189
feeding a kind of fake stories and we

1279
00:50:16,189 --> 00:50:17,779
seem to be optimizing a lot of other

1280
00:50:17,779 --> 00:50:20,150
stuff for this as well and we seems kind

1281
00:50:20,150 --> 00:50:24,529
of desire this inability to fully and to

1282
00:50:24,529 --> 00:50:25,760
see and understand the world

1283
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:28,940
these are images that AI researcher

1284
00:50:28,940 --> 00:50:30,800
Robert Elliott Smith discovered in his

1285
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:34,280
own photo stream when he he posted

1286
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:35,890
originally the two pictures on the left

1287
00:50:35,890 --> 00:50:39,320
and Google's I think it's called like

1288
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:40,910
auto magical algorithm or something

1289
00:50:40,910 --> 00:50:44,270
produced the image on the right which is

1290
00:50:44,270 --> 00:50:45,920
an image that combines them both to have

1291
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:47,990
both people smiling but it's an image of

1292
00:50:47,990 --> 00:50:50,720
a moment that didn't happen right now

1293
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:54,350
ever it's a memory of something that

1294
00:50:54,350 --> 00:50:57,350
never actually occurred and likewise

1295
00:50:57,350 --> 00:50:59,360
Adobe is pushing a thing you might sing

1296
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:03,370
called voco which is a way of editing

1297
00:51:03,370 --> 00:51:06,230
sound as you would edit text so

1298
00:51:06,230 --> 00:51:09,410
basically a tool for a kind of public

1299
00:51:09,410 --> 00:51:10,790
tool the kind of Photoshop for audio

1300
00:51:10,790 --> 00:51:13,160
essentially that allows anyone to kind

1301
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:14,420
of create these kind of things our

1302
00:51:14,420 --> 00:51:17,870
entire a lot of our technological

1303
00:51:17,870 --> 00:51:20,090
advances seem to be in order to kind of

1304
00:51:20,090 --> 00:51:21,920
create and change and mold the fabric of

1305
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:23,060
reality in ways they're not always

1306
00:51:23,060 --> 00:51:25,610
visible and transparent to to the

1307
00:51:25,610 --> 00:51:27,890
visitor and the outcome of that is a

1308
00:51:27,890 --> 00:51:29,090
world in which people don't believe

1309
00:51:29,090 --> 00:51:33,190
anything when when complete authority of

1310
00:51:33,190 --> 00:51:36,410
any kind of trust in institutions no I'm

1311
00:51:36,410 --> 00:51:38,180
no one for blind trust in institutions

1312
00:51:38,180 --> 00:51:41,300
either but the fact that when in the UK

1313
00:51:41,300 --> 00:51:44,300
you had a referendum and something like

1314
00:51:44,300 --> 00:51:48,350
more than 25% of views of participants

1315
00:51:48,350 --> 00:51:49,940
believe that was going to be rigged by

1316
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:52,610
the security services is a very worrying

1317
00:51:52,610 --> 00:51:56,330
situation to be in and that is a result

1318
00:51:56,330 --> 00:52:00,680
of a kind of a crisis of literacy an

1319
00:52:00,680 --> 00:52:02,600
inability to deal with these

1320
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:05,270
increasingly complex narratives that are

1321
00:52:05,270 --> 00:52:07,610
supplied by our technologies more

1322
00:52:07,610 --> 00:52:09,550
information as we saw in the

1323
00:52:09,550 --> 00:52:11,690
pharmacological research we've seen the

1324
00:52:11,690 --> 00:52:13,610
neural networks doesn't necessarily lead

1325
00:52:13,610 --> 00:52:15,380
to better decisions and in fact often

1326
00:52:15,380 --> 00:52:18,320
kind of hardens people against them the

1327
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:20,870
sociologists fredric jameson in his work

1328
00:52:20,870 --> 00:52:23,110
cognitive mapping described this as

1329
00:52:23,110 --> 00:52:25,100
described conspiracy theory in

1330
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:27,410
particular as this attempt cognitively

1331
00:52:27,410 --> 00:52:30,350
to map landscapes of information which

1332
00:52:30,350 --> 00:52:32,300
is simply too vast for people to grasp

1333
00:52:32,300 --> 00:52:35,210
the no one person can hold this entire

1334
00:52:35,210 --> 00:52:37,550
system of information inside their head

1335
00:52:37,550 --> 00:52:39,070
it's the same problem as big date

1336
00:52:39,070 --> 00:52:40,810
it's also the same problem we encounter

1337
00:52:40,810 --> 00:52:43,780
every day on the internet because we are

1338
00:52:43,780 --> 00:52:45,460
continually faced with stuff that

1339
00:52:45,460 --> 00:52:47,530
doesn't map into our model of the world

1340
00:52:47,530 --> 00:52:49,480
and that is existentially terrifying

1341
00:52:49,480 --> 00:52:51,160
because we're quite weak you know

1342
00:52:51,160 --> 00:52:53,980
lizard brained creatures and that we

1343
00:52:53,980 --> 00:52:55,420
have not equipped ourselves with

1344
00:52:55,420 --> 00:52:57,370
literacy for dealing with complicated

1345
00:52:57,370 --> 00:53:00,220
and often paradoxical information and as

1346
00:53:00,220 --> 00:53:01,900
a child of the kind of hippie internet

1347
00:53:01,900 --> 00:53:04,450
right this is deeply worrying because

1348
00:53:04,450 --> 00:53:05,620
for me the internet has always been a

1349
00:53:05,620 --> 00:53:07,800
place of incredible emancipatory

1350
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:11,200
possibility a place in which you have

1351
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:13,420
access to all of this information and it

1352
00:53:13,420 --> 00:53:15,730
makes the world more comprehensible to

1353
00:53:15,730 --> 00:53:18,040
you it gives you grant greater agency

1354
00:53:18,040 --> 00:53:21,730
and that allows you to make more social

1355
00:53:21,730 --> 00:53:23,110
better ordered whatever your decision

1356
00:53:23,110 --> 00:53:26,470
very naive you it turns out okay but a

1357
00:53:26,470 --> 00:53:28,270
really important one to get across

1358
00:53:28,270 --> 00:53:29,860
because we're living in a world where

1359
00:53:29,860 --> 00:53:31,210
information has been increasingly

1360
00:53:31,210 --> 00:53:34,210
available for a long time now and is

1361
00:53:34,210 --> 00:53:36,160
increasingly riven by fundamentalisms

1362
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:38,230
and deeply entrenched differing points

1363
00:53:38,230 --> 00:53:40,150
of view so we need to think very

1364
00:53:40,150 --> 00:53:44,280
carefully about what our and what our

1365
00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:46,510
responses are what are the new

1366
00:53:46,510 --> 00:53:48,970
literacies that we need to build not to

1367
00:53:48,970 --> 00:53:51,040
understand more information but to

1368
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:52,840
understand these these differences

1369
00:53:52,840 --> 00:53:56,950
between information there was a I took

1370
00:53:56,950 --> 00:53:58,600
the title of this talk from a piece in

1371
00:53:58,600 --> 00:54:01,090
the New York Times from a few weeks ago

1372
00:54:01,090 --> 00:54:03,780
by the director the global weather 4k

1373
00:54:03,780 --> 00:54:06,310
global weather foundation a big weather

1374
00:54:06,310 --> 00:54:08,890
forecasting agency huge computational

1375
00:54:08,890 --> 00:54:10,830
weather forecasting data the full deal

1376
00:54:10,830 --> 00:54:13,830
and what he was saying was that

1377
00:54:13,830 --> 00:54:20,500
alongside these growth of information

1378
00:54:20,500 --> 00:54:22,330
available to us is also huge in

1379
00:54:22,330 --> 00:54:24,820
cataclysmic change climate change is now

1380
00:54:24,820 --> 00:54:27,070
progressing to such an extent the

1381
00:54:27,070 --> 00:54:28,900
atmosphere is warming to such an extent

1382
00:54:28,900 --> 00:54:33,220
that the models that we've built based

1383
00:54:33,220 --> 00:54:35,530
on the hundreds plus years of weather

1384
00:54:35,530 --> 00:54:37,720
data we've been gathering no longer

1385
00:54:37,720 --> 00:54:40,000
apply the weather models are actually

1386
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,480
getting worse because the underlying

1387
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:46,150
models that generate them no longer work

1388
00:54:46,150 --> 00:54:48,220
so well in Inked in a rapidly changing

1389
00:54:48,220 --> 00:54:50,170
climate and we're actually moving

1390
00:54:50,170 --> 00:54:52,180
towards a place where we're going to

1391
00:54:52,180 --> 00:54:52,810
know

1392
00:54:52,810 --> 00:54:55,240
less about the world than we did

1393
00:54:55,240 --> 00:54:56,680
previously we're going to be able to

1394
00:54:56,680 --> 00:54:58,510
predict less and that's going to affect

1395
00:54:58,510 --> 00:55:08,140
our ability to prepare for it this no

1396
00:55:08,140 --> 00:55:10,990
not that this and I'm running out of

1397
00:55:10,990 --> 00:55:11,890
time and I want to take a couple of

1398
00:55:11,890 --> 00:55:14,200
questions when I was got them and here's

1399
00:55:14,200 --> 00:55:17,370
what I think I don't think the internet

1400
00:55:17,370 --> 00:55:20,320
and so much the stuff that we've built

1401
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:22,710
on top of it is a tool for understanding

1402
00:55:22,710 --> 00:55:25,420
the world as some kind of abstract

1403
00:55:25,420 --> 00:55:28,960
entity that we can regard as a static

1404
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:31,230
and stable rather it's a tool for

1405
00:55:31,230 --> 00:55:33,250
understanding our own ability to

1406
00:55:33,250 --> 00:55:34,840
understand interact with the world and

1407
00:55:34,840 --> 00:55:39,370
it's the most extraordinary complex and

1408
00:55:39,370 --> 00:55:41,320
advanced such tool we've built as a

1409
00:55:41,320 --> 00:55:42,880
species so me it's a it's a it's a

1410
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:44,080
cultural tool it's something that

1411
00:55:44,080 --> 00:55:46,150
emerges like language and writing

1412
00:55:46,150 --> 00:55:49,870
emerged and and what's extraordinary bad

1413
00:55:49,870 --> 00:55:53,620
is that no person or no single set of

1414
00:55:53,620 --> 00:55:56,050
intentions created this thing or

1415
00:55:56,050 --> 00:55:57,730
imagined what we might do with it

1416
00:55:57,730 --> 00:56:00,490
foresaw its uses it's an unconsciously

1417
00:56:00,490 --> 00:56:02,050
generated tool for unconscious

1418
00:56:02,050 --> 00:56:03,970
generation and it's this model of

1419
00:56:03,970 --> 00:56:06,250
complexity it's kind of cloudy cloud and

1420
00:56:06,250 --> 00:56:09,000
if we are to take our kind of

1421
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,440
technological understanding of the world

1422
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:13,780
seriously and I feel that we must

1423
00:56:13,780 --> 00:56:15,340
recognize that it's teaching us to

1424
00:56:15,340 --> 00:56:18,400
expect and understand differences in the

1425
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:20,290
world to understand cloudiness and

1426
00:56:20,290 --> 00:56:22,570
complexity and not conformity and

1427
00:56:22,570 --> 00:56:26,200
similarity thank you very much

thank you so much James we now have a

1431
00:56:42,780 --> 00:56:46,340
couple more minutes to take questions

1432
00:56:46,340 --> 00:56:49,080
please use the microphones or show up at

1433
00:56:49,080 --> 00:56:53,460
the microphone so I can see you Oh a

1434
00:56:53,460 --> 00:57:04,530
bear after anyone it's alright it's not

1435
00:57:04,530 --> 00:57:14,640
or beer later is also good okay are you

1436
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:17,730
sure you don't have any questions this

1437
00:57:17,730 --> 00:57:23,340
is your chance I think we're good all

1438
00:57:23,340 --> 00:57:23,910
