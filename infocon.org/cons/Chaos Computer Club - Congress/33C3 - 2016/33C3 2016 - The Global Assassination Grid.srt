something that's a bit more important to

them that it is to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> United States so</font>

there's more of a chance that there

<font color="#E5E5E5">my biggest fears come true we've gone</font>

to something else that we're not really

sure what that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> United States</font>

the generals and puts them in his

444

whatever foreign policy is going to be

446
00:24:28,409 --> 00:24:35,639
it's going to be heavily militarized<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

447
00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:39,238
you know drones are<font color="#E5E5E5"> very easy weapon to</font>

00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:13,350
misconception is that you know the drone

<font color="#E5E5E5">links to the satellite and then go</font>

straight down<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ramstein</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but there's a lot</font>

of redundant infrastructure<font color="#E5E5E5"> involved so</font>

475
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:24,570
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> like say if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> their signal loss or if</font>

476
00:26:21,570 --> 00:26:30,960
you needed to transfer like higher

477
00:26:24,570 --> 00:26:36,270
bandwidth<font color="#E5E5E5"> like images you would use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> RF</font>

478
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:40,410
so we called the bacon system<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Wi-Fi</font>

479
00:26:36,270 --> 00:26:43,350
in the sky and this is a precursor to

480
00:26:40,410 --> 00:26:45,060
network-centric warfare like this is

481
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:48,780
this is the beginning where you have

you name it

00:28:43,810 --> 00:28:55,419
those are things to be concerned about

<font color="#E5E5E5">contracting agencies that are helping</font>

different structures<font color="#CCCCCC"> three different</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">organizations to parse out like what</font>

well they all have different security

clearances they all have different you

602
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:51,020
know protections for whistleblowers and

603
00:33:43,399 --> 00:33:53,239
whatnot<font color="#E5E5E5"> so the other thing that comes</font>

604
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:56,299
into play is you have the developers to

605
00:33:53,240 --> 00:34:01,580
create algorithms<font color="#E5E5E5"> in order to do narrow</font>

00:34:08,570 --> 00:34:14,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's probably you know upwards of two</font>

00:34:14,610 --> 00:34:19,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">there's not enough people not enough</font>

612
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:21,179
operators to sift through all that so

613
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:26,279
you need algorithms to help you

614
00:34:21,179 --> 00:34:30,569
determine you know like if there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">suspicious patterns of activity or if</font>

616
00:34:30,570 --> 00:34:38,880
there are you know

617
00:34:33,750 --> 00:34:40,230
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> so the question always lies is when</font>

618
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:42,690
you're using all of these different

619
00:34:40,230 --> 00:34:44,280
algorithms in tandem with people that

620
00:34:42,690 --> 00:34:48,780
may or may not understand what the

621
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:53,850
algorithm itself actually does<font color="#CCCCCC"> I is it</font>

622
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:57,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">possible that say you know that the</font>

00:34:53,850 --> 00:35:01,200
limitations of the algorithm<font color="#E5E5E5"> aren't</font>

624
00:34:57,300 --> 00:35:04,260
congruent with the reality you might be

625
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:07,980
presented<font color="#E5E5E5"> like let's say you want to</font>

631

there's not many people who do that but

632
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:30,030
like let's say<font color="#CCCCCC"> Mardi Gras happens and</font>

633
00:35:27,090 --> 00:35:32,100
you know you have you know this

00:35:30,030 --> 00:35:35,340
situation where you have a bunch of

635

people wearing purple hats that<font color="#CCCCCC"> create</font>

this technology working for you and this

638
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:49,380
is a big problem with with what I find

00:35:47,130 --> 00:35:51,990
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> with commanders is they get all</font>

with using their emails

<font color="#E5E5E5">and they're sitting here looking at all</font>

645
00:36:11,770 --> 00:36:15,370
this technology and it creates this

646
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:18,400
false sense of confidence like that you

647
00:36:15,370 --> 00:36:19,810
have like this<font color="#E5E5E5"> this overarching</font>

that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so the other issue is military</font>

there's a researcher and his job was

active as a position of authority while

721
00:40:20,190 --> 00:40:24,270
he's telling this volunteer to increase

00:41:03,870 --> 00:41:07,470
administer the legal<font color="#E5E5E5"> lethal shock so</font>

00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:10,440
even a barrier of a window

740
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:25,529
they were testing a person's visual

false positives that were identified

747
00:41:41,370 --> 00:41:50,190
with those targets<font color="#CCCCCC"> so I you know a</font>

748
00:41:47,790 --> 00:41:54,690
person's visual acuity is much better

749
00:41:50,190 --> 00:42:00,480
than a<font color="#E5E5E5"> pixelated screen and that extra</font>

750
00:41:54,690 --> 00:42:02,820
barrier<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of yeah it</font>

751
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:06,930
it prevents the person from feeling the

752
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:09,450
the the the reality of the fact that

753
00:42:06,930 --> 00:42:14,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're killing somebody</font>

754
00:42:09,450 --> 00:42:17,700
so another element of all of this is the

755
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:22,110
the acronyms that we use<font color="#CCCCCC"> military-age</font>

there's there's multiple ways to

technically assassinating people that

creates a international norm and

essentially any country that would want

789
00:44:21,530 --> 00:44:27,590
to do the same thing would be able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

if say<font color="#E5E5E5"> Pakistan wanted to use the same</font>
