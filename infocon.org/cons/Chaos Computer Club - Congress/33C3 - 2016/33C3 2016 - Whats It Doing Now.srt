told have you tried turning it off and

on again<font color="#E5E5E5"> today we will be talking about</font>

less actual hands-on<font color="#E5E5E5"> flying ability so</font>

11
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:49,380
now imagine you're the pilot flying a

00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:41,538
so how many of you here in the hall

29
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:47,990
today our pilots are quite a few<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

commercial<font color="#CCCCCC"> pilots a few ATP anyone</font>

31
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:55,009
yeah there's one heard one<font color="#E5E5E5"> that can see</font>

32
00:01:51,349 --> 00:01:57,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so some of you will know about some</font>

33
00:01:55,009 --> 00:02:01,819
of the stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> I hope there's a bit new</font>

34
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:02,599
stuff for everyone<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> let's get right</font>

35
00:02:01,819 --> 00:02:05,420
into it

36
00:02:02,599 --> 00:02:09,289
what the announcer said was a bit of a

00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:12,170
nice<font color="#CCCCCC"> folklore it's not completely true</font>

39
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:16,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm going to talk about is</font>

40
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:18,200
automation in the aircraft and the ideas

41
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:19,458
often as he said that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's just a</font>

computer and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the pilot doesn't have to</font>

43
00:02:19,459 --> 00:02:23,060
do anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay that's one saying that</font>

44
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:27,379
in modern airplanes<font color="#CCCCCC"> there will only be</font>

00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:30,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">one pilot and a dog and the pilot is</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">so that's not quite yet how it is when I</font>

51
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:43,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">talk the very little bit about the</font>

54
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:52,210
mostly and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'll tell you a short</font>

tale of two throttles<font color="#E5E5E5"> or to thrust</font>

57
00:02:55,030 --> 00:03:00,040
also<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk about human pilots</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how they</font>

cope with failures or don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> as the case</font>

may be and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I haven't seen a lot of other</font>

63
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:15,790
have a tentative conclusion<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can't see</font>

very fine to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> future so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm not sure</font>

briefly the method that we have

causality<font color="#CCCCCC"> called the counterfactual</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> test</font>

165
00:07:34,919 --> 00:07:38,969
and then you can make<font color="#E5E5E5"> a very nice graph</font>

166
00:07:37,139 --> 00:07:43,199
for accidents<font color="#CCCCCC"> they are usually bigger</font>

00:07:38,969 --> 00:07:45,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">than that but it's more or less</font>

168
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:47,639
objective criterion for causality and

169
00:07:45,629 --> 00:07:50,279
then different people with some

170
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:51,809
experience in the domain<font color="#E5E5E5"> make why</font>

171
00:07:50,279 --> 00:07:53,308
because graphs of an accident they

172
00:07:51,809 --> 00:07:59,669
usually are very similar to each other

173
00:07:53,309 --> 00:08:04,439
so there's a lot of automation<font color="#E5E5E5"> on modern</font>

174
00:07:59,669 --> 00:08:06,448
airplanes and it's quite hard to get it

175
00:08:04,439 --> 00:08:10,379
right and one of the reasons is that

176
00:08:06,449 --> 00:08:13,529
unlike for many situations and cars on

177
00:08:10,379 --> 00:08:15,269
railroad vehicles<font color="#E5E5E5"> there is no default</font>

178
00:08:13,529 --> 00:08:17,099
safe stage you can't just turn

179
00:08:15,269 --> 00:08:19,919
everything off and stop by the roadside

180
00:08:17,099 --> 00:08:23,669
<font color="#CCCCCC">so you always have to decide the</font>

181
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:25,769
engineers always have to plan for many

182
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:29,039
eventualities what can happen in the air

183
00:08:25,769 --> 00:08:33,120
and decide what<font color="#E5E5E5"> given a certain set of</font>

the correct one and you get into that

situation where the computers get the

automation in aircraft in the first

649

place is to reduce<font color="#E5E5E5"> pilot workload</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we're</font>

652
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:54,020
the issues<font color="#E5E5E5"> were talking about here is</font>

that in a situation where something's

situation the question what is it doing

658
00:31:02,150 --> 00:31:08,000
now what's the industry sort of approach

659
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:11,630
to that effect and what do you think

660
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:14,120
about that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think the the traditional</font>
