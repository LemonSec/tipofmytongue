1
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:13,840
[Music]

2
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:17,110
so our next speakers Marcus Landgraf who

3
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:18,520
currently works for the European Space

4
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:20,140
Agency ISA

5
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:21,340
you might have heard of them they're

6
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:24,220
like the NASA of Europe he's going to

7
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:26,860
talk about space elevators because you

8
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:28,840
know the rocket equation is pretty it's

9
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,300
pretty unforgiving and the M drive

10
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:32,650
doesn't really get you out of gravity

11
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:34,690
wells so we might need a space elevator

12
00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:38,280
please welcome our speaker

13
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:47,949
[Applause]

14
00:00:47,949 --> 00:00:49,430
thank you

15
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:52,250
who of you have heard of the space

16
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:57,170
elevator who of you beliefs and will

17
00:00:57,170 --> 00:00:59,629
keep your hands up keep your ends up who

18
00:00:59,629 --> 00:01:01,160
have you believes to see a space

19
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:04,909
elevator in a lifetime all right okay I

20
00:01:04,909 --> 00:01:05,780
get the picture

21
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:08,030
so most of you have heard about the

22
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:11,030
space elevator and about half I would

23
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:14,930
guess believe it would become reality so

24
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:17,360
I would like to make it extra real for

25
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,350
you tonight

26
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:20,899
is it's about as real as it gets I

27
00:01:20,899 --> 00:01:22,820
believe because I'm going to talk about

28
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:27,220
the elevator to the moon since I'm also

29
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:29,570
representative of Issa I would also like

30
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:31,190
to talk about a little bit what Issa

31
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:35,000
does today to go to the moon and why to

32
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,670
go to the moon so let me give just a

33
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:43,520
quick overview on why and how one anyone

34
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,490
can get to the moon and then talk about

35
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:49,759
why Issa goes to the moon today or how

36
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:52,670
we actually do that and then we come to

37
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:55,190
the really the the core of the talk

38
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:57,289
which is beyond Rockets going beyond

39
00:01:57,289 --> 00:01:58,640
rockets and of course that's the

40
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,380
elevator and then talk about benefits

41
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:04,190
because you're a big community you're a

42
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:07,099
very successful community what draws you

43
00:02:07,099 --> 00:02:07,670
here

44
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:10,310
but what really draws you here is the

45
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:12,890
benefits that Drive you everybody you

46
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:15,470
know every one of you has is looking for

47
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:20,300
benefits for fun for knowledge for you

48
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:22,310
know meeting people and and the

49
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:24,379
community is really exists because you

50
00:02:24,379 --> 00:02:26,780
draw benefits from it and that's also

51
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:29,150
true for anything that we try to do in

52
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:31,760
society and space exploration is part of

53
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,099
that and that brings me to the final

54
00:02:34,099 --> 00:02:35,360
point which is the community I would

55
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,040
also like to share a couple of links

56
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,830
with you that will enable you to engage

57
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:41,900
in the space elevator in Luna

58
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:44,150
exploration in general int with ISA of

59
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:47,360
course all right enough said about the

60
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:51,890
overview so why the moon this is a

61
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:53,989
little fun bit that I put together and I

62
00:02:53,989 --> 00:02:54,300
would

63
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:56,460
read it to you I will not comment on it

64
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:59,990
because it's a bit the folklore about

65
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:04,080
space and the moon and you can form your

66
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,180
own opinion about those things some of

67
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:09,540
them I will also talk during my talk

68
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:12,150
today so there's this famous guy by the

69
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,890
name of bill kaysing who of course says

70
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:16,380
that Apollo was filmed in a Hollywood

71
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:22,580
studio everybody who likes to watch

72
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:26,040
British animated films knows wallace and

73
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,140
gromit and they insist that the moon is

74
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:29,970
made of cheese which solves their

75
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:33,870
cracker problem of course you all know

76
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:36,930
the Apollo program that ended in 1972 so

77
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:38,250
there is an issue of the Time magazine

78
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:41,610
that says soon robots will be

79
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:44,070
intelligent so there is no need to risk

80
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:51,170
human lives 2010 President Obama said

81
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:54,240
while talking about his vision on the

82
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,520
space program that we have been there

83
00:03:56,520 --> 00:04:00,239
before and I will leave that without any

84
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:03,870
comments and there's another nice movie

85
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:07,830
by the name of Aaron sky and in that

86
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:10,710
movie yeah I like that too

87
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:12,319
[Applause]

88
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:14,989
and then of course in that move you have

89
00:04:14,989 --> 00:04:18,079
president Sarah Palin and she says that

90
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:20,358
who are these guys anyway Nazis from the

91
00:04:20,358 --> 00:04:24,500
moon wah ha ha ha so so this is I think

92
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,840
very inspirational folklore about the

93
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:29,570
moon let's get to the to the real thing

94
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:34,400
why we explore space now if I say we I

95
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,850
always um in these talks with ISA and

96
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:40,729
always talking about us Europeans but

97
00:04:40,729 --> 00:04:43,130
the European idea is bigger than Europe

98
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:46,669
so so let's just feel as Europeans for a

99
00:04:46,669 --> 00:04:49,490
minute because the moon is in our

100
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:52,729
exploration DNA we Europeans are

101
00:04:52,729 --> 00:04:56,270
explorers and I just visited my home

102
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:59,150
town of castle in Essen little bit south

103
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:03,650
of here a couple of last days and I took

104
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:05,930
a picture there in a museum and that's a

105
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:09,940
picture of 18th century artist scientist

106
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:12,620
who made he who observed the total

107
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:15,470
eclipse of the moon and he did that and

108
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:19,630
the contract of a nobleman in Casa who

109
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:22,310
sponsored you know artists scientists to

110
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:24,139
come to his court and teach about

111
00:05:24,139 --> 00:05:27,680
science so already 200 years ago and

112
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,440
even earlier we have been really engaged

113
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,930
in science because we understand this is

114
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:35,030
part of our cultural heritage

115
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:39,260
actually this nobleman is the grand

116
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:42,500
grand grand son of another nobleman who

117
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:45,080
hired a Swiss guy to come also to castle

118
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:47,870
to measure the position of the stars in

119
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:50,960
the sky at the time a very difficult and

120
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,510
undertaking because the sky the Stars

121
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:55,280
move in the sky due to the Earth's

122
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,889
rotation so you have to know the time

123
00:05:57,889 --> 00:06:00,380
very well if you want to tell what is

124
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:02,120
the position of a star because it's you

125
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,320
know if you don't know the time it's

126
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,590
moving all the time

127
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:10,009
so this guy goes boogie made a clock and

128
00:06:10,009 --> 00:06:13,310
that clock was so precise and it needed

129
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:16,250
a third indicator which was the

130
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:17,840
indicator for the second

131
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,690
so the second the time unit ii was

132
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:22,820
invented in my hometown of castle it's

133
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:24,570
not many people know that

134
00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:26,370
and that shows that exploration is not

135
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:29,130
only in our DNA but this is also 12 to

136
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:31,080
our benefit because without the second

137
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:33,300
hand on our watches we would be in

138
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:34,680
trouble now these days we don't need

139
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:38,910
them anymore but but it tells you that

140
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:40,800
our everyday life is really much

141
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,770
inspired by inspire by inspiration and

142
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:46,700
inspired by exploration of course

143
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:48,870
another reason why we should go to the

144
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:50,970
moon is discoveries now a little bit

145
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:54,360
arguing against President Obama we have

146
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,980
not been there we have been in a couple

147
00:06:55,980 --> 00:07:00,330
of places which are very special but the

148
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:02,280
moon is largely unexplored country

149
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:05,550
there's a nice book by Arlene Kraus

150
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:07,740
University Press you can get it for

151
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:10,410
cheap on any even as an e-book I believe

152
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:14,880
that beside him there is a new moon many

153
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,160
of the most dramatic recent discoveries

154
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,400
in planetary science are lunar

155
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:22,290
only in the past few years has lunar

156
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:24,440
exploration accelerated again and many

157
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:27,720
do not realize how rapidly our knowledge

158
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:30,600
of the moon is changing I've just put

159
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,640
two pictures here that are from recent

160
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,620
observations of the moon the upper upper

161
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:37,410
right one is a hole that was punctured

162
00:07:37,410 --> 00:07:40,290
by a meteorite in the roof of a cave on

163
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:44,430
the moon and the underground world of

164
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:46,320
the moon we have no idea what's inside

165
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:48,660
there and of course the first idea that

166
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:50,670
comes to everybody's mind is we could

167
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:52,980
live there we could be protected from

168
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:58,260
meteorites and from solar radiation the

169
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:03,690
lower image is a nice very mysterious

170
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:06,750
regions called ina and ina is apparently

171
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:08,880
the tip of a volcano ancient volcano

172
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:12,840
that blew away this dusty'll lid of the

173
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,760
moon so what you see here this more

174
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:17,010
bright stuff is probably the real

175
00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:19,020
surface of the Moon while the rest of

176
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:21,330
the real surface is still hidden under

177
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:24,210
this dusty little bit more dark what

178
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:27,090
people call the regolith so there's so

179
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:29,580
much more to explore and certainly if

180
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:31,260
aliens would come to earth and would

181
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:32,940
take a couple of samples in the Sahara

182
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:35,280
Desert and some in the Gobi Desert they

183
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,659
could not claim the

184
00:08:36,659 --> 00:08:38,669
they've been on earth and have explored

185
00:08:38,669 --> 00:08:43,708
earth completely so here's a philosophic

186
00:08:43,708 --> 00:08:46,110
take on it and because it's philosophy

187
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:50,069
it has a lot of text I will not read

188
00:08:50,069 --> 00:08:51,839
that I will ask you to read it after the

189
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:53,579
talk and then report back to me what you

190
00:08:53,579 --> 00:08:57,509
take from it now I will just say the

191
00:08:57,509 --> 00:08:59,730
basic idea so there are two school of

192
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:00,990
thoughts one school of thought says

193
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:04,110
there's limits to growth earth will run

194
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:06,629
out of resources soon so we better be

195
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:09,839
very careful with them the other school

196
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:11,670
of thought which is much less famous

197
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:14,279
says there are there's a limitless

198
00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:16,319
amount of resources because we are

199
00:09:16,319 --> 00:09:18,689
connected to the universe and the latter

200
00:09:18,689 --> 00:09:20,100
one is called the extra-terrestrial

201
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:22,560
imperative was formulated first time by

202
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,019
a craft Erica German flosses a

203
00:09:25,019 --> 00:09:27,000
philosopher who was also a part of the

204
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,519
team own of the phone braun engineering

205
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:31,199
team that went to the united states to

206
00:09:31,199 --> 00:09:34,009
build moon rock and he basically says

207
00:09:34,009 --> 00:09:37,350
nature has shown to us that whenever

208
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:40,889
there is a limit evolution will overcome

209
00:09:40,889 --> 00:09:42,980
that limit and he gives the example of

210
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:46,050
phytoplankton which is a bacteria or a

211
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:49,050
singular cellular organism that ran out

212
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:51,709
of energy at some point but discovered

213
00:09:51,709 --> 00:09:55,470
the reuse of extraterrestrial anis or

214
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:58,439
energy source which is the Sun so free

215
00:09:58,439 --> 00:10:01,680
to plankton discovered by evolution how

216
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,380
sunlight which is extraterrestrial could

217
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:06,600
be used to make energy and store energy

218
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:09,930
on earth and by the same token he says

219
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:12,870
human technological development is the

220
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:16,110
kind of evolution and we will be able to

221
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:18,600
overcome that and how do we overcome

222
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,670
that is pretty clear that we use

223
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:22,399
resources that are not from this planet

224
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:25,230
so this is the extraterrestrial

225
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:28,199
imperative the third reason why we

226
00:10:28,199 --> 00:10:31,230
should use the moon is of course you see

227
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:33,540
this nice gravitational well that is

228
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:35,970
made by the earth and stiff achill to

229
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:37,589
get out of it because you need energy to

230
00:10:37,589 --> 00:10:40,620
get out but the moon creates an extra

231
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:43,139
spot there which has this interesting

232
00:10:43,139 --> 00:10:45,559
interesting structure that allows to put

233
00:10:45,559 --> 00:10:47,720
spacecraft in a equal

234
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:51,740
reinstate and put it like stations there

235
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:53,870
so that you can reach the surface of the

236
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:56,240
Moon as well as deeper into the solar

237
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:59,420
system so really these three things we

238
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:04,189
can it's in our culture it there is new

239
00:11:04,189 --> 00:11:07,370
knowledge to be gained and it is a great

240
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:09,230
starting point for further exploration

241
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:11,750
so these three things are our reasons to

242
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:14,360
explore the moon why is it so hard to go

243
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:17,209
there why are we why did we stop the

244
00:11:17,209 --> 00:11:18,860
reason is the rocket equation this is

245
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:20,480
the rocket equation formulated by

246
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:23,870
Konstantin Tsiolkovsky in 1895 it's

247
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:25,879
basically an expression of the Newtonian

248
00:11:25,879 --> 00:11:28,339
law of mechanics that says to each

249
00:11:28,339 --> 00:11:31,100
reaction you need an equal but opposite

250
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:35,149
reaction and this is the only way to

251
00:11:35,149 --> 00:11:37,850
propel yourself in space if I'm walking

252
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:40,939
across the stage what I'm doing is I'm

253
00:11:40,939 --> 00:11:43,790
pushing the stage behind me so that I'm

254
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:47,930
propelled forward and the the link that

255
00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:50,839
makes it possible for me is my soles of

256
00:11:50,839 --> 00:11:52,790
the shoes if there was if there was a

257
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:54,290
slippery surface that would not allow

258
00:11:54,290 --> 00:11:55,790
the transmission of momentum between

259
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:57,829
myself and the stage I would just slip

260
00:11:57,829 --> 00:12:01,790
and fall but if in that case I would

261
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:05,180
have to use reaction principle of Newton

262
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:07,490
to propel myself and in this formula

263
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:09,139
there is a very important parameter it's

264
00:12:09,139 --> 00:12:11,240
the Delta V that's on the left hand side

265
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:13,519
which gives you the amount of how much

266
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:14,959
you have to change your velocity to

267
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:17,120
reach a certain target and in the lower

268
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,860
part you see the numbers here that are

269
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:22,309
not very important but it's very

270
00:12:22,309 --> 00:12:23,809
difficult to get from Earth into

271
00:12:23,809 --> 00:12:25,220
low-earth orbit which is the first

272
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:29,360
little gravestone there and then 3200

273
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,709
meters per second to go to the Luna

274
00:12:30,709 --> 00:12:33,199
vicinity and then on top to go to lunar

275
00:12:33,199 --> 00:12:35,899
orbit you need another 800 and then to

276
00:12:35,899 --> 00:12:37,990
the surface of the Moon you knew 2,000

277
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:41,660
if you know that our current technology

278
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:43,939
limits us to use exhaust velocities

279
00:12:43,939 --> 00:12:47,149
which is the V either of less than 5,000

280
00:12:47,149 --> 00:12:49,220
meters per second that it tells you why

281
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:52,220
we need big rockets to launch small

282
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:56,029
payloads we need a 10 700 ton Ariane 5

283
00:12:56,029 --> 00:12:58,610
rocket to launch a 10 ton satellite into

284
00:12:58,610 --> 00:13:00,030
geostationary transfer

285
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:02,790
and that makes it so expensive now

286
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:05,220
expensive means what is the economics of

287
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:07,530
space transportation and what you see on

288
00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:08,550
the right-hand side is much more

289
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:11,130
interesting this is a table of how much

290
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:13,530
it costs today if you would go to a

291
00:13:13,530 --> 00:13:15,570
launch service provider to launch your

292
00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:17,790
stuff into space in Earth orbits is

293
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:20,820
about 10,000 euros into system of spaces

294
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:22,860
tens times ten times that's or a hundred

295
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:24,900
thousand to lunar orbit two hundred

296
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:27,360
thousand down to the surface of the Moon

297
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:31,320
1 million euro one kilo to bring

298
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:34,350
anything back from the moon 10 million

299
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:37,580
euros so if you will even would get back

300
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:40,920
platinum or the most precious stuff that

301
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:43,380
you can think of it's still cheaper to

302
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:44,190
get it on earth

303
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:48,510
so forget about the space economy with

304
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:50,820
rockets that will not work the only

305
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:52,650
thing that the the private sector can do

306
00:13:52,650 --> 00:13:55,680
is they can make space travel more

307
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,110
efficient so that for the governmental

308
00:13:58,110 --> 00:14:00,810
players everything becomes a little bit

309
00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:02,790
cheaper but there will be never be able

310
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:04,890
to get stuff from the moon and sell it

311
00:14:04,890 --> 00:14:06,900
here on earth that's just physically

312
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:09,870
impossible if they use rockets on the

313
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:11,550
left hand side you see that actually the

314
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:15,270
the cost raises with the square root of

315
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:16,890
the mass so if you have a big rocket

316
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:20,100
it's more expensive but the rate of

317
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:22,980
increase which is lower than one so that

318
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:25,860
means that for each kilo you pay less if

319
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:27,420
you have a big rocket and that's why

320
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:30,890
Ariane 5 is for example bigger than RN 4

321
00:14:30,890 --> 00:14:33,060
so this is the economics of space

322
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:34,860
transportation that's the situation that

323
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:39,120
we have today and in that situation ISA

324
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,970
has a program that that takes us indeed

325
00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:45,330
to the moon and I think just two slides

326
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:46,830
about how is I goes to the moon today

327
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:49,290
like I said the biggest problem is

328
00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:52,560
gaining access to the moon and that is

329
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,480
why there's the big blowup and then

330
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,640
there's the little bit smaller but still

331
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,500
challenging problem of surface

332
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:02,160
operations and these two problems really

333
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,920
break down into smaller bits we need to

334
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,660
get to the moon we need staging so we

335
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:09,270
have to change the vehicle you know let

336
00:15:09,270 --> 00:15:09,930
it

337
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:12,089
you know stages that already spent the

338
00:15:12,089 --> 00:15:14,010
fuel go away so that everything is

339
00:15:14,010 --> 00:15:16,230
lighter then we need landing which is

340
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:17,880
difficult because it's difficult terrain

341
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:20,790
and then we also have to launch from the

342
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:21,180
moon

343
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:22,890
which is something that is incredibly

344
00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:24,839
difficult given the fact that already

345
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:27,240
launching from Earth is difficult and

346
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:29,490
then you can break it down further and

347
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:32,370
each of these topical problems ISA has a

348
00:15:32,370 --> 00:15:35,730
program for example to get humans

349
00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:39,270
astronauts go to cislunar space we are

350
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:41,640
cooperating with NASA to build a human

351
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,620
space vehicle that will launch first

352
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:48,440
time in 2018 around the moon ISA

353
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:51,209
proposes a program to build a habitation

354
00:15:51,209 --> 00:15:54,779
module for this cislunar habitat this is

355
00:15:54,779 --> 00:15:57,600
a habitation staging post in this is in

356
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,700
cislunar space that will enable access

357
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:01,890
to the lunar surface but also into

358
00:16:01,890 --> 00:16:05,130
deeper space then ISA works together

359
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:06,810
with host cosmos the Russian Space

360
00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:09,810
Agency to build a landing system for

361
00:16:09,810 --> 00:16:12,029
Luna applications and there is a camera

362
00:16:12,029 --> 00:16:16,470
that will first go in 2018 2019 to

363
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:18,270
prepare our technology for landing on

364
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:20,339
the moon and then further down the road

365
00:16:20,339 --> 00:16:22,170
we're working together with an

366
00:16:22,170 --> 00:16:24,089
international consortium or with

367
00:16:24,089 --> 00:16:26,610
international partners to build a

368
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:28,800
demonstrator mission that does

369
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,440
everything so with land we we take off

370
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,690
and we have a little robot that shows

371
00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:36,209
mobility on the surface and this is an

372
00:16:36,209 --> 00:16:37,650
integrated system that we are currently

373
00:16:37,650 --> 00:16:41,550
proposing to our member states and ISA

374
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:43,560
would would like to play the part of the

375
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:45,690
essent getting away from the moon

376
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:47,490
launching a rocket from the moon's the

377
00:16:47,490 --> 00:16:51,870
problem here and then the final a

378
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:54,300
problem that we face is habitation on

379
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:57,420
the lunar surface and that is of course

380
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:59,250
challenging is perhaps not as

381
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:01,260
challenging as habitation in free space

382
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:05,540
but still there's difficult problems the

383
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:08,400
another topic that still needs to be

384
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,859
addressed is getting resources from the

385
00:17:10,859 --> 00:17:13,559
moon not necessarily to make money from

386
00:17:13,559 --> 00:17:15,470
it like I depends probably not going to

387
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:18,260
be a good profitable of good business

388
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:21,569
but we already have a payload that tells

389
00:17:21,569 --> 00:17:23,880
us how we could use resources to

390
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:26,730
stay in the base on the lunar surface so

391
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:29,160
now this is a little bit of a time error

392
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:32,789
error arrow here to show you how we want

393
00:17:32,789 --> 00:17:35,520
to develop that over over time so the

394
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:38,070
first thing is like I showed this is the

395
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:39,480
drill and the camera and that goes

396
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:42,240
already in 2018 and 2020 one in two

397
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,880
missions together with bas cosmos then

398
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,740
there's the Orion vehicle first launched

399
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:50,210
in 2018 the first human mission in 21

400
00:17:50,210 --> 00:17:52,530
then this is Luna habitat

401
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:54,419
we're going to be built up somewhere

402
00:17:54,419 --> 00:17:55,980
around the mid-2020s

403
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:57,990
perhaps a little bit earlier and then

404
00:17:57,990 --> 00:17:59,970
this interesting demonstration mission

405
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:04,020
in the mid 2020s and then ISA does

406
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:07,200
indeed plan or propose in cooperation

407
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,299
with international partners to have a

408
00:18:09,299 --> 00:18:11,159
human mission or a series of human

409
00:18:11,159 --> 00:18:13,620
missions to the moon to really extort

410
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:16,380
the exploration but all of that is still

411
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:18,799
limited by our transportation problem

412
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:21,809
but that's what we can do today like I

413
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:24,150
promised that that's the realism of the

414
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:28,080
situation right now but let's go beyond

415
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:31,710
this go let's go beyond rockets when I

416
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:36,120
said that it can propel ourselves only

417
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:38,429
in space only by pushing something back

418
00:18:38,429 --> 00:18:42,330
you know axial equals a Archer I lied a

419
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:44,909
bit so I was not completely honest to

420
00:18:44,909 --> 00:18:48,360
you guys because if you have a physical

421
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,730
connection to the planetary body that

422
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:53,130
you're orbiting then you can transmit

423
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:55,919
momentum and that physical connection is

424
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:57,510
created by a space elevator and the

425
00:18:57,510 --> 00:18:59,340
basic principle I think really many

426
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:01,140
people in the room already know it so I

427
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:04,140
will skip to is quite quickly the idea

428
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:07,289
is to have a long rope and the Rope has

429
00:19:07,289 --> 00:19:10,320
the center of mass and that center of

430
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:13,440
mass is orbiting the planet in sync with

431
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:17,490
the planets rotation so in the end the

432
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:20,580
rope will touch the surface of the

433
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:22,860
planet but will not necessarily exert a

434
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:25,260
force on it so it's simply it's in like

435
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:28,230
a satellite but it's going around the

436
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:30,390
planet at the same rate as the planet is

437
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:31,660
rotating

438
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:33,760
and then you can climb up and down that

439
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:36,520
rope with with the cabin you know you

440
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:39,160
bake a nice cabin around you with air

441
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:41,650
and you can go up and down and I'm not I

442
00:19:41,650 --> 00:19:43,690
know your your heads are full of

443
00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:45,640
questions and I try to answer some of

444
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:47,950
them and certainly the broad of space

445
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:50,110
elevator community can answer most

446
00:19:50,110 --> 00:19:54,190
questions today so just as a start the

447
00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:56,260
energy actually is not so much the

448
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:57,970
problem indeed we still have to provide

449
00:19:57,970 --> 00:20:00,370
the energy to go from Earth's surface up

450
00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:03,070
into the gravity well but that's only

451
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:05,440
one kilowatt hour per kilogram and how

452
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,480
much is kilowatt hour in Germany today

453
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:11,890
is like 40 cent I guess ice will twice

454
00:20:11,890 --> 00:20:15,630
the price than in France but never mind

455
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:20,080
it still cheap enough right then the

456
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,750
climber can go up and down with electric

457
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:25,030
energy as electric motors attached to

458
00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:27,250
that cable cannot go up and down the

459
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:29,830
cable is actually kept taught by the

460
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:33,970
forces of gravity and centrifugal force

461
00:20:33,970 --> 00:20:38,380
so gravity pulls the part to the left

462
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:42,010
down and centrifugal force pulls it to

463
00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:45,549
the right up so that the the cable is

464
00:20:45,549 --> 00:20:47,409
always taught then of course as the

465
00:20:47,409 --> 00:20:49,179
climber goes up and down the climber

466
00:20:49,179 --> 00:20:51,039
creates what's called the Coriolis force

467
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:53,500
and it puts the sideways force on the

468
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:56,169
cable and the sideways force creates

469
00:20:56,169 --> 00:20:59,620
wave in the Cape and what does the wave

470
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:02,169
- not much because of the high tension

471
00:21:02,169 --> 00:21:04,360
on the cable and then left-hand side you

472
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:06,010
see a couple of Wiggly lines which is

473
00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:08,470
the free motion of the elevator and if

474
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:10,929
you can read the small numbers we are

475
00:21:10,929 --> 00:21:17,370
talking about 700 meters of maximum

476
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:21,010
amplitude of of that and if you go to

477
00:21:21,010 --> 00:21:23,860
higher vibrational modes it's it's

478
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:27,820
really not causing a lot of a lot of

479
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:30,220
vibration in terms of spatial vibration

480
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:32,559
of course the the cable for earth and

481
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:35,500
this is the earth cable would be a

482
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,539
hundred fifty four thousand kilometers

483
00:21:37,539 --> 00:21:39,880
long so this is not to scale right on

484
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:43,510
the wire x-axis you have 150 440 4000

485
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:44,720
kilometers and why

486
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:50,450
you have just kilometres and and you see

487
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:52,070
that this the free motion of the cable

488
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:53,960
and by introducing a little bit of

489
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:55,970
wiggle on the base of the cable you can

490
00:21:55,970 --> 00:21:58,280
even manage that vibration so if you

491
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:00,500
have a vibration on it you can cancel it

492
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:03,380
out so no problem and the other side

493
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:05,030
shows you what happens if the climber

494
00:22:05,030 --> 00:22:06,799
goes up and this is actually on the moon

495
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:08,690
cables taken from a paper by Pierce

496
00:22:08,690 --> 00:22:13,190
natal where when the when the climber

497
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:14,390
goes up you will have a bit of

498
00:22:14,390 --> 00:22:16,789
oscillation in the order of a couple of

499
00:22:16,789 --> 00:22:20,510
meters normally but that's not it's

500
00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:24,020
certainly manageable okay so let's talk

501
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:26,690
about strong cables because we need

502
00:22:26,690 --> 00:22:29,240
strong cables to kind of not make them

503
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:31,429
rupture so what's the strong material I

504
00:22:31,429 --> 00:22:34,280
like to express strength of a cable in

505
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:36,049
terms of rupture length because it

506
00:22:36,049 --> 00:22:38,600
expresses the strength of the cable at

507
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:40,640
the same times as its specific weight

508
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:43,010
the rupture length is the length of a

509
00:22:43,010 --> 00:22:46,100
cable you can suspend it vertically in a

510
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:50,450
1g constant 1g without it snapping under

511
00:22:50,450 --> 00:22:51,140
its own weight

512
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:53,690
so steel cables are pretty strong you

513
00:22:53,690 --> 00:22:56,240
can have 11 kilometers if you make it 12

514
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,429
it would just gone bang because of its

515
00:22:58,429 --> 00:23:02,150
own weight carbon fiber goes up to 330

516
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:07,250
kilometers and a mystical material

517
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:09,409
that's called multi walled nanotubes

518
00:23:09,409 --> 00:23:12,110
that exists only in laboratories in very

519
00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:13,970
small quantities makes it up to three

520
00:23:13,970 --> 00:23:16,159
thousand three hundred kilometres for

521
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:18,770
earth you need for earth elevator you

522
00:23:18,770 --> 00:23:20,270
need about two thousand five hundred

523
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:23,630
kilometres of rupture lengths so so this

524
00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:25,400
mystical material would be able to do

525
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:28,789
the earth elevator so and there on the

526
00:23:28,789 --> 00:23:30,350
right-hand side you see other materials

527
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:31,940
that are available today and you see

528
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:34,940
some where figures about 250 to 500

529
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:37,669
kilometres rupture length the longer the

530
00:23:37,669 --> 00:23:38,000
better

531
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,900
why does that why is that important

532
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:46,309
because the magic of the taper people

533
00:23:46,309 --> 00:23:47,780
have been asking how strong does the

534
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:49,340
cable have to be to make a space

535
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:51,830
elevator and there was a paper by Jeremy

536
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:53,690
Pearson at Allen

537
00:23:53,690 --> 00:23:56,840
act astronautica 1975 and he explains we

538
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:59,690
can do it from any key any material can

539
00:23:59,690 --> 00:24:02,210
even make it from steel only you have to

540
00:24:02,210 --> 00:24:04,160
make it much thicker at the center of

541
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:05,930
gravity than you make it at the base

542
00:24:05,930 --> 00:24:08,960
now these taper ratios how that is

543
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,330
called becomes so extreme for the earth

544
00:24:11,330 --> 00:24:14,870
that for weak materials that elevator

545
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:18,110
becomes not feasible so I show you this

546
00:24:18,110 --> 00:24:21,290
magical multi walled nanotubes material

547
00:24:21,290 --> 00:24:23,210
that allows to have a space elevator

548
00:24:23,210 --> 00:24:27,740
from Earth with a taper ratio of about 8

549
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:32,450
or so material that exists today is for

550
00:24:32,450 --> 00:24:36,740
example carbon fiber or the famous

551
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:39,080
honeycomb polymer so that these are

552
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:41,060
fibers you can buy in the shop today and

553
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:43,610
you can see for Earth it would be like

554
00:24:43,610 --> 00:24:46,460
thousands of times thicker and it's not

555
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:48,350
a problem of making something figure but

556
00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:50,510
if you make something you start with say

557
00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:53,120
a centimeter and you have to make it ten

558
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:55,550
thousand ten centimeters wide at this

559
00:24:55,550 --> 00:24:57,890
widest point and the whole thing is 144

560
00:24:57,890 --> 00:24:59,840
thousand kilometers long the total mass

561
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:03,110
of this thing becomes humongous so

562
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:07,220
that's not going to work so so but for

563
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:09,200
Moon and Mars this is much easier you

564
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,790
can see and the reason is of course that

565
00:25:10,790 --> 00:25:13,010
Moon and Mars have lower gravity and

566
00:25:13,010 --> 00:25:14,930
they have slower rotational rates than

567
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:16,880
the earth and then you end up saying

568
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:19,190
that with existing materials if I have a

569
00:25:19,190 --> 00:25:22,220
taper ratio of about eight or five or

570
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:27,430
four I can I can make an elevator so why

571
00:25:27,430 --> 00:25:30,200
space elevators easier on the moon than

572
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:32,330
on earth we have a fusible ribbon

573
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:34,130
material now we call this thing a ribbon

574
00:25:34,130 --> 00:25:36,620
and I will come back to why we call the

575
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:41,180
Rope a ribbon we have very few

576
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:42,740
artificial satellites around the moon

577
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:44,810
that could potentially collide with the

578
00:25:44,810 --> 00:25:47,090
cable and we have no human-made space

579
00:25:47,090 --> 00:25:50,330
debris around the moon and there is no

580
00:25:50,330 --> 00:25:52,100
atmosphere on the moon that could kind

581
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:53,990
of with chemical reaction damage the

582
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:57,260
cable and there is no there is no strong

583
00:25:57,260 --> 00:25:58,450
trapped

584
00:25:58,450 --> 00:26:00,920
radiation in because there is no

585
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:03,010
magnetic field around the moment so so

586
00:26:03,010 --> 00:26:06,090
the elevator around Earth

587
00:26:06,090 --> 00:26:09,360
is quite futuristic it is quite cents

588
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,490
fiction but their elevator around the

589
00:26:11,490 --> 00:26:13,679
moon it is still science fiction but

590
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:16,470
it's closer so it's not two thousand

591
00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:19,350
thirty one two thousand one if you

592
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:21,150
compare the movies then you know what I

593
00:26:21,150 --> 00:26:26,070
mean right so one word about the climber

594
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:28,710
I know that climber is the most

595
00:26:28,710 --> 00:26:30,929
inspiring part of the Space Invader but

596
00:26:30,929 --> 00:26:33,210
it's by far not the biggest problem and

597
00:26:33,210 --> 00:26:35,730
in my life I've always tried to crack

598
00:26:35,730 --> 00:26:39,720
the thickest nut first so you know one

599
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:41,940
day when somebody's gives me that cable

600
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:44,309
I will start talking about the climber

601
00:26:44,309 --> 00:26:46,890
but there's a nice concept out there

602
00:26:46,890 --> 00:26:48,929
that basically runs on two wheels you

603
00:26:48,929 --> 00:26:50,490
have electric motor and you have solar

604
00:26:50,490 --> 00:26:52,620
arrays providing the energy and you can

605
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:54,360
have a couple of capsules attached to it

606
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:57,240
that you know transport the transporter

607
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:01,020
payload so what is it that we get out of

608
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:03,240
this moon elevator why should we do it

609
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:06,480
beyond exploring the moon well first of

610
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:09,840
all you remember that diagram right but

611
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:12,179
may that's a lot of headaches and

612
00:27:12,179 --> 00:27:14,549
stomachache but if you have space

613
00:27:14,549 --> 00:27:16,020
elevator the first thing that goes away

614
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:19,049
is this because you can go from one

615
00:27:19,049 --> 00:27:21,809
orbit to the lunar surface so this

616
00:27:21,809 --> 00:27:24,690
change in velocity that you need to make

617
00:27:24,690 --> 00:27:26,909
in order to go from one orbit down to

618
00:27:26,909 --> 00:27:32,159
the surface all of a sudden goes away so

619
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:36,120
your rocket has to do much less work not

620
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:38,100
only that only this number goes away

621
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:40,409
another 800 meters per second because

622
00:27:40,409 --> 00:27:42,840
you're starting already in the lunar

623
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:45,630
vicinity so this goes away your rocket

624
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:49,140
makes even less work so all you have to

625
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:50,850
do is basically now you have to launch

626
00:27:50,850 --> 00:27:54,750
an Ariane 5 rocket you get 7 pounds to

627
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:56,760
the lunar surface today with an Ariane 5

628
00:27:56,760 --> 00:28:03,020
you get about 500 kilos so less than

629
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:06,409
yeah roughly 10% of it

630
00:28:06,409 --> 00:28:09,990
but if we had let's speculate a bit if

631
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:12,600
we had also an earth elevator

632
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,899
you could also cancel those two figures

633
00:28:14,899 --> 00:28:18,000
so the number that you see for Delta V

634
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,289
becomes 0

635
00:28:19,289 --> 00:28:22,629
that means you can have a free transfer

636
00:28:22,629 --> 00:28:25,629
from the Earth's surface to the lunar

637
00:28:25,629 --> 00:28:26,259
surface

638
00:28:26,259 --> 00:28:28,090
no propellant needed and I'll show you

639
00:28:28,090 --> 00:28:31,240
in a minute how that looks like oh no

640
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:34,840
not in a minute I showed you now right

641
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:36,580
this is a computer program it's publicly

642
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:38,950
available on the web and I have the URL

643
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:41,710
shared with you in my final slide and

644
00:28:41,710 --> 00:28:43,809
what I've done I've played with it and

645
00:28:43,809 --> 00:28:46,090
you see in this in the in this in the

646
00:28:46,090 --> 00:28:48,549
crosshair you see the earth and downward

647
00:28:48,549 --> 00:28:51,429
pointing is the earth elevator and on

648
00:28:51,429 --> 00:28:54,369
this central ring you see the moon with

649
00:28:54,369 --> 00:28:56,320
a long line and extending with a blue

650
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,749
dot at the end that's the moon elevator

651
00:28:58,749 --> 00:29:01,269
now I put a payload that's the little

652
00:29:01,269 --> 00:29:05,080
green dot down there let me let me find

653
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:07,289
my cursor so I can I can play with it

654
00:29:07,289 --> 00:29:11,499
okay so there is my payload right so now

655
00:29:11,499 --> 00:29:15,940
I'm starting to let the earth rotate and

656
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:19,440
you see the time scale up there is 512

657
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:22,720
so it's a factor of 512 over real time

658
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:25,240
so the Earth rotates and the payload

659
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:26,950
goes with the elevator of course

660
00:29:26,950 --> 00:29:29,619
and while the Earth rotates of course

661
00:29:29,619 --> 00:29:31,269
the moon is moving slightly but much

662
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:35,080
more much less fast when this reaches

663
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:37,299
the 90 degree position I let go

664
00:29:37,299 --> 00:29:39,190
so this payload will just be detached

665
00:29:39,190 --> 00:29:42,159
from the cable and then this will

666
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:45,279
describe a free fall trajectory to

667
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:47,559
wherever it takes it because of the laws

668
00:29:47,559 --> 00:29:50,590
of gravitation and then now I've sped it

669
00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:53,169
up to 8192 to make it a little bit

670
00:29:53,169 --> 00:29:54,909
faster so you don't have to wait to sit

671
00:29:54,909 --> 00:29:56,039
here all evening

672
00:29:56,039 --> 00:29:58,869
because things as they got farther away

673
00:29:58,869 --> 00:30:01,659
from Earth they go slower and then what

674
00:30:01,659 --> 00:30:04,059
you can do and you see now every turn of

675
00:30:04,059 --> 00:30:07,450
the earth is of course one day is that

676
00:30:07,450 --> 00:30:08,740
at some point you find the trajectory

677
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:11,499
way you can this object can fly a

678
00:30:11,499 --> 00:30:14,460
rendezvous with your moon elevator and

679
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:18,999
you can just latch on and then descend

680
00:30:18,999 --> 00:30:20,860
on the moon elevator all the way to

681
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:26,610
lunar surface so so you would have a

682
00:30:26,610 --> 00:30:30,009
direct connection from the earth to the

683
00:30:30,009 --> 00:30:32,370
moon and the other way around

684
00:30:32,370 --> 00:30:34,430
from the moon you can bring any material

685
00:30:34,430 --> 00:30:37,880
platinum gold from the lunar surface

686
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:40,470
back to earth without any use of

687
00:30:40,470 --> 00:30:43,200
propellant and of course what that would

688
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:46,140
do is to enable us to make real use of

689
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:48,330
space economic use of space we could

690
00:30:48,330 --> 00:30:50,250
create structures that are so humongous

691
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:53,610
that they would just now collect enough

692
00:30:53,610 --> 00:30:56,490
sunlight for example 24/7 to provide

693
00:30:56,490 --> 00:30:58,890
earth with energy you know this is a

694
00:30:58,890 --> 00:31:01,050
little animation showing you use

695
00:31:01,050 --> 00:31:02,760
microwaves to be in the energy down to

696
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:06,230
the moon or to the Earth's surface and

697
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:08,880
and you can make these structures you

698
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:12,780
can make space hotels because all of a

699
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:15,500
sudden you've broken this you hacked

700
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:20,040
celestial mechanics and I think that's

701
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:22,710
the basic idea this is why there is

702
00:31:22,710 --> 00:31:24,690
interested in the space elevator so my

703
00:31:24,690 --> 00:31:28,710
final thought here is that perhaps if

704
00:31:28,710 --> 00:31:33,210
you want to engage in space exploration

705
00:31:33,210 --> 00:31:35,160
in the moon exploration and would also

706
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:37,710
like to point you towards the taught by

707
00:31:37,710 --> 00:31:41,340
my boss section en Verano the Director

708
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:45,030
General of ISA at 8 o'clock in in room

709
00:31:45,030 --> 00:31:47,190
number one and he will talk about the

710
00:31:47,190 --> 00:31:50,100
Moon Village and how this community will

711
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:52,770
make it happen that we will engage into

712
00:31:52,770 --> 00:31:55,710
lunar exploration and final word on the

713
00:31:55,710 --> 00:31:57,600
community here are a couple of links

714
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:01,590
emails Twitter names and URLs that you

715
00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:03,660
can use when you download the

716
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:06,450
presentation to make it happen and be

717
00:32:06,450 --> 00:32:10,730
part of the space elevator thank you

718
00:32:21,049 --> 00:32:24,720
we have a rather generous half-hour for

719
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:28,350
Q&A so please get ready to cue the

720
00:32:28,350 --> 00:32:30,779
microphones for questions there's

721
00:32:30,779 --> 00:32:32,850
basically microphones everywhere so just

722
00:32:32,850 --> 00:32:35,399
queue and also of course as always we

723
00:32:35,399 --> 00:32:37,769
have questions from the internet so if

724
00:32:37,769 --> 00:32:39,629
you end the chat watching the stream

725
00:32:39,629 --> 00:32:42,629
we'll take care of you as well we'll

726
00:32:42,629 --> 00:32:45,289
just start with microphone two please

727
00:32:45,289 --> 00:32:48,330
hello thank you very much for your talk

728
00:32:48,330 --> 00:32:52,529
so what I was so wondering is that you

729
00:32:52,529 --> 00:32:55,830
do not mention at all if there is going

730
00:32:55,830 --> 00:33:00,450
to be an extra problem that the cable

731
00:33:00,450 --> 00:33:02,700
will have to take care of that is the

732
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:04,080
stretching due to the difference in

733
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:06,419
gravity as it goes along the gravity

734
00:33:06,419 --> 00:33:08,730
well is that going to be a problem or is

735
00:33:08,730 --> 00:33:11,159
that a very minor factor thanks for the

736
00:33:11,159 --> 00:33:15,269
question I hit that of course and the

737
00:33:15,269 --> 00:33:17,460
answer is that the pearce model is made

738
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:19,559
such that the tension on the cable is

739
00:33:19,559 --> 00:33:22,379
constant through the cable by making it

740
00:33:22,379 --> 00:33:24,210
thicker at the place of the biggest

741
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:26,519
force because you know attention equals

742
00:33:26,519 --> 00:33:28,289
force divided by cross-section squared

743
00:33:28,289 --> 00:33:31,919
by cross-section and then that's taken

744
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:35,700
care of okay thank you before we get to

745
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:37,230
the next question just a little

746
00:33:37,230 --> 00:33:40,320
announcement please try to be quiet and

747
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:42,480
if you need to leave leave very very

748
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,639
quietly and if you don't have to leave

749
00:33:44,639 --> 00:33:46,080
very urgently just do us the courtesy

750
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:48,029
and wait until the end of to talk -

751
00:33:48,029 --> 00:33:49,019
thank you

752
00:33:49,019 --> 00:33:52,879
could we get an internet question please

753
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:58,620
could we get their microphone please

754
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:01,810
question work you mix with okay is it

755
00:34:01,810 --> 00:34:04,060
already known how the elevator affects

756
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:08,080
the Earth's rotation it does not at all

757
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:11,710
there's of course a small value you know

758
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:14,469
that by nature effects the earth speeds

759
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:17,080
up when it contracts because of its

760
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:19,600
cooling down but it normally it slows

761
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:21,540
down because of the presence of the moon

762
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:25,750
attaching a lunar cable of about a

763
00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:28,110
thousand tons will not affect any

764
00:34:28,110 --> 00:34:31,260
because the moon moon is much more heavy

765
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:34,000
could we get microphone number seven

766
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,659
please my question is what will this

767
00:34:37,659 --> 00:34:40,120
mean for future further space

768
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:43,239
exploration missions that what are the

769
00:34:43,239 --> 00:34:44,650
implications for further space

770
00:34:44,650 --> 00:34:46,630
exploration missions starting from the

771
00:34:46,630 --> 00:34:49,120
moon or does that have are there any

772
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:51,760
implications for this thanks for the

773
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:54,010
question yes there are and of course

774
00:34:54,010 --> 00:34:56,199
that's part of the deal that we try to

775
00:34:56,199 --> 00:34:58,510
prepare deeper space missions by making

776
00:34:58,510 --> 00:35:00,850
propellant on the lunar surface and then

777
00:35:00,850 --> 00:35:02,380
transporting it into cislunar space

778
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:04,240
which could be then a starting point for

779
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:06,310
mars missions or jupiter missions or

780
00:35:06,310 --> 00:35:08,980
even at some point missions to Proxima

781
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:12,300
Centauri but I that's an extra talk

782
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:14,040
thank you

783
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:18,130
mic number one place thank you for a

784
00:35:18,130 --> 00:35:21,430
great talk I'll try to keep the question

785
00:35:21,430 --> 00:35:23,410
brief and feel free to direct me to the

786
00:35:23,410 --> 00:35:25,300
next talk by your boss if you feel like

787
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:27,730
you could answer the question better but

788
00:35:27,730 --> 00:35:31,090
it seems to me that most of the reasons

789
00:35:31,090 --> 00:35:34,960
for going to the moon apart from the

790
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:37,560
science of course which is important

791
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:39,970
could be solved easier from low-earth

792
00:35:39,970 --> 00:35:43,350
orbit I'm thinking specifically of

793
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:47,140
refueling spacecrafts and I believe that

794
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:50,230
the Earth orbits fuel depots could be

795
00:35:50,230 --> 00:35:52,780
refueled from asteroids and you wouldn't

796
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:55,300
need to build a space elevator on the

797
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:58,480
moon I'm with you hundred percent and of

798
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:00,130
course my boss can answer much any

799
00:36:00,130 --> 00:36:01,630
question better than I can

800
00:36:01,630 --> 00:36:05,770
but let me give it a try

801
00:36:05,770 --> 00:36:08,320
and we give it a try of course that's

802
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,290
actually my day job so I'm looking at

803
00:36:10,290 --> 00:36:13,110
architectures of exploration to find out

804
00:36:13,110 --> 00:36:15,700
what you know what's the best way and

805
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:18,970
you're right if you were if your goal

806
00:36:18,970 --> 00:36:21,820
was to have a Mars mission or a series

807
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:24,520
of Mars missions that use refueling then

808
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:26,320
you would prepare perhaps not use fuel

809
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:28,060
from the lunar surface you would use

810
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:30,820
asteroids and transport the material not

811
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:32,950
necessarily to low-earth orbit because

812
00:36:32,950 --> 00:36:35,230
of the high Delta V penalty but you're

813
00:36:35,230 --> 00:36:37,000
right there there's competing things and

814
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,100
the real reason for this Luna elevator

815
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:42,340
to just make it clear is if you want to

816
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:45,070
exploit the moon economically for not

817
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:47,830
necessarily use it for further space

818
00:36:47,830 --> 00:36:51,280
exploration but for bringing precious

819
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,930
metal to the earth that would be the

820
00:36:52,930 --> 00:36:55,930
real reason for the Luna elevator but do

821
00:36:55,930 --> 00:36:57,400
we not also have access to those

822
00:36:57,400 --> 00:37:00,220
materials and the asteroids not

823
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:02,740
necessarily if you have to bring it if

824
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:04,300
you have to bring it out of

825
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:06,220
interplanetary space because you have to

826
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:08,680
then fly a reentry trajectory and that

827
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:11,680
is very expensive but let's take that

828
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:13,600
offline sure thank you

829
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:17,320
do we have Internet questions yes why

830
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:19,840
are carbon nanotubes or graphene sohbet

831
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:23,800
materials can you repeat please I didn't

832
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:25,050
catch that

833
00:37:25,050 --> 00:37:29,230
okay now that you carbon nanotubes or

834
00:37:29,230 --> 00:37:32,470
graphene has been young materials that

835
00:37:32,470 --> 00:37:34,690
have we talked about a lot we haven't

836
00:37:34,690 --> 00:37:37,090
graded sohbet materials for the elevator

837
00:37:37,090 --> 00:37:38,560
no they're good materials but they're

838
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:42,310
not there yet that's the thing I gave a

839
00:37:42,310 --> 00:37:46,480
talk in 2013 on TEDx whoever wants to

840
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:48,880
Google lunkov space elevator finds that

841
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:51,970
on YouTube and there I'm talking about

842
00:37:51,970 --> 00:37:56,170
how to make that possible and and you

843
00:37:56,170 --> 00:37:57,850
can tell from my tarp back then that I

844
00:37:57,850 --> 00:37:59,500
was a little bit younger at the time and

845
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:01,900
little bit uncertain so and that's why

846
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:04,510
and then it's then that's exactly the

847
00:38:04,510 --> 00:38:06,790
reason is that the that the nanotubes

848
00:38:06,790 --> 00:38:09,250
are not there yet so thanks for the

849
00:38:09,250 --> 00:38:10,200
question

850
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:17,069
number 8 please so high up here hi

851
00:38:17,069 --> 00:38:19,829
see you talked about that we have the

852
00:38:19,829 --> 00:38:22,650
material to build a lunar moon elevator

853
00:38:22,650 --> 00:38:25,049
but not the earth one so is it possible

854
00:38:25,049 --> 00:38:27,749
to make the earth cable just shorter and

855
00:38:27,749 --> 00:38:29,579
then use a rocket to connect to the

856
00:38:29,579 --> 00:38:32,489
lower part of the elevator that is true

857
00:38:32,489 --> 00:38:35,789
and you were invited to give a talk next

858
00:38:35,789 --> 00:38:39,179
year about that it's it's yeah there's a

859
00:38:39,179 --> 00:38:40,949
whole community out there about space

860
00:38:40,949 --> 00:38:43,650
tethers and and yes there's all options

861
00:38:43,650 --> 00:38:45,239
but they're sometimes risky because you

862
00:38:45,239 --> 00:38:46,619
have to fly a rendezvous with the end of

863
00:38:46,619 --> 00:38:49,499
the cable and ISA even was involved in

864
00:38:49,499 --> 00:38:51,390
tether experiments back in the 90s so

865
00:38:51,390 --> 00:38:53,729
yes there is a community out there the

866
00:38:53,729 --> 00:38:55,229
trades who make make makes it possible

867
00:38:55,229 --> 00:38:59,099
but the real benefit that solves a lot

868
00:38:59,099 --> 00:39:00,779
of operational problem is when you

869
00:39:00,779 --> 00:39:03,449
create a real elevator that actually

870
00:39:03,449 --> 00:39:05,669
attaches to the cellar has two celestial

871
00:39:05,669 --> 00:39:08,910
body a follow-up question if you have a

872
00:39:08,910 --> 00:39:11,309
space tether and don't you need fuel on

873
00:39:11,309 --> 00:39:13,859
board to reposition it otherwise it

874
00:39:13,859 --> 00:39:16,410
flies away or it comebacks correct that

875
00:39:16,410 --> 00:39:18,479
is correct and the normally people you

876
00:39:18,479 --> 00:39:20,369
have solved that problem by making it a

877
00:39:20,369 --> 00:39:22,769
low thrust transfer using a solar

878
00:39:22,769 --> 00:39:24,749
electric propulsion or using the earth

879
00:39:24,749 --> 00:39:27,599
magnetic field by putting in electric

880
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:29,459
power so there's all kinds of solutions

881
00:39:29,459 --> 00:39:33,359
for that oh thanks what do we get number

882
00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:37,199
six please when you travel to the moon

883
00:39:37,199 --> 00:39:39,659
an obvious advantage of rocket based

884
00:39:39,659 --> 00:39:42,150
transportation is that you can more or

885
00:39:42,150 --> 00:39:44,249
less freely choose the point of your

886
00:39:44,249 --> 00:39:48,029
landing so with that space elevator

887
00:39:48,029 --> 00:39:51,659
concept allow to reposition the the

888
00:39:51,659 --> 00:39:54,719
elevator so you can more freely choose

889
00:39:54,719 --> 00:39:56,880
where you're going yes there is a paper

890
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:59,189
that I'm citing also in this talk by

891
00:39:59,189 --> 00:40:03,619
Pearson in two thousand five or eight

892
00:40:03,619 --> 00:40:05,699
where they basically connect the

893
00:40:05,699 --> 00:40:07,919
elevator to a tramway so they pinned the

894
00:40:07,919 --> 00:40:09,900
elevator a bit to higher latitudes and

895
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:11,459
then starting from that higher latitude

896
00:40:11,459 --> 00:40:14,279
points to a tramway but in any case you

897
00:40:14,279 --> 00:40:15,809
can once you're on the surface you can

898
00:40:15,809 --> 00:40:19,739
drive I mean come on take your okay take

899
00:40:19,739 --> 00:40:23,429
your all-wheel drive and just go or you

900
00:40:23,429 --> 00:40:26,009
know there there's more easy solutions

901
00:40:26,009 --> 00:40:28,169
to that then then with the rocket and

902
00:40:28,169 --> 00:40:29,829
you're right with a blue the rocket

903
00:40:29,829 --> 00:40:32,819
you can choose your landing site freely

904
00:40:32,819 --> 00:40:36,069
could we get mic number three please yes

905
00:40:36,069 --> 00:40:38,739
I have a question about the failure

906
00:40:38,739 --> 00:40:42,039
state and how it differs from for Earth

907
00:40:42,039 --> 00:40:44,920
cable and the moon cable so I would

908
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:47,619
guess an earth capable up in the

909
00:40:47,619 --> 00:40:50,410
atmosphere if something goes wrong what

910
00:40:50,410 --> 00:40:52,749
would it be for a moon cable so so first

911
00:40:52,749 --> 00:40:54,309
of all the the moon cable if it

912
00:40:54,309 --> 00:40:56,859
disconnects so that there's one part

913
00:40:56,859 --> 00:40:58,390
coming back it would just impact lunar

914
00:40:58,390 --> 00:41:00,400
surface and be destroyed upon upon

915
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:00,940
impact

916
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:03,160
normally with hypervelocity impacts you

917
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:06,459
get a complete obliteration of the

918
00:41:06,459 --> 00:41:09,609
material and about only 10% or even 5%

919
00:41:09,609 --> 00:41:11,259
stay on the surface the rest goes into

920
00:41:11,259 --> 00:41:14,529
the solar wind but that nothing that's

921
00:41:14,529 --> 00:41:16,869
that doesn't have to take place you can

922
00:41:16,869 --> 00:41:19,660
always sever the cable on purpose when

923
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:22,479
you have a break and there are a couple

924
00:41:22,479 --> 00:41:24,339
of other things other reasons that I

925
00:41:24,339 --> 00:41:26,219
didn't explain in my talk why

926
00:41:26,219 --> 00:41:28,509
potentially decay you can make it so

927
00:41:28,509 --> 00:41:33,160
that the cable never breaks mic number

928
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:36,699
four place is on your slides that the

929
00:41:36,699 --> 00:41:38,949
calculations about the cable wobble were

930
00:41:38,949 --> 00:41:42,160
taken with elevator speeds of about 250

931
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:45,789
kilometers per hour calculating that the

932
00:41:45,789 --> 00:41:48,219
cable from Earth would be about 150

933
00:41:48,219 --> 00:41:50,829
thousand kilometres long I make that

934
00:41:50,829 --> 00:41:55,420
four point five weeks around that so the

935
00:41:55,420 --> 00:41:57,579
whole transfer would take multiple

936
00:41:57,579 --> 00:41:59,799
months yes are there any plans on

937
00:41:59,799 --> 00:42:01,479
sending humans up with that space

938
00:42:01,479 --> 00:42:03,880
elevator or would Rockets be like

939
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:06,789
cheaper because they faster the only

940
00:42:06,789 --> 00:42:09,249
reason we have unmanned space program is

941
00:42:09,249 --> 00:42:11,380
because you can you cannot make small

942
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:16,599
humans and if you have a system that is

943
00:42:16,599 --> 00:42:18,579
so capable like space elevator you would

944
00:42:18,579 --> 00:42:21,789
take humans from day one so so yes and

945
00:42:21,789 --> 00:42:24,069
they would just have the food for 4 five

946
00:42:24,069 --> 00:42:27,039
5 months ok thank you what well

947
00:42:27,039 --> 00:42:29,199
technically we have small humans very

948
00:42:29,199 --> 00:42:31,559
smart

949
00:42:31,849 --> 00:42:33,900
could we get another question from the

950
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:36,630
internet please yes how about the

951
00:42:36,630 --> 00:42:38,940
voltage generated by the magnetic field

952
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:41,310
of the elevator would appear risk or

953
00:42:41,310 --> 00:42:45,119
another source of energy both for the

954
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:47,220
earth elevator it could be a source of

955
00:42:47,220 --> 00:42:50,609
energy or depending on the material you

956
00:42:50,609 --> 00:42:52,650
choose but for the moon elevator there

957
00:42:52,650 --> 00:42:55,740
is no voltage because there is no global

958
00:42:55,740 --> 00:43:00,180
magnetic field around the moon number 8

959
00:43:00,180 --> 00:43:08,190
please you say space elevator from Earth

960
00:43:08,190 --> 00:43:12,140
is not possible with materials we know

961
00:43:12,140 --> 00:43:19,460
what is about a launch loop or something

962
00:43:19,460 --> 00:43:25,950
so you talk about you try to connect

963
00:43:25,950 --> 00:43:31,550
both ends of cable yep to the off end ah

964
00:43:31,550 --> 00:43:35,220
ok I haven't looked at that concept

965
00:43:35,220 --> 00:43:36,990
never heard of it but thanks for the

966
00:43:36,990 --> 00:43:38,609
inspiration I will look it up

967
00:43:38,609 --> 00:43:41,160
launch loop you said so like like you

968
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:42,510
have both ends on the earth and then

969
00:43:42,510 --> 00:43:44,940
with centrifugal force you can yeah okay

970
00:43:44,940 --> 00:43:46,589
the tension will probably be the same

971
00:43:46,589 --> 00:43:49,380
but let me let me check it out sounds

972
00:43:49,380 --> 00:43:51,710
interesting thank you

973
00:43:51,710 --> 00:43:54,380
could we get number 3 please

974
00:43:54,380 --> 00:43:58,770
hi coming back to your question from the

975
00:43:58,770 --> 00:44:00,660
beginning whether we will see this in

976
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:01,890
our lifetime or not

977
00:44:01,890 --> 00:44:04,380
can you give an estimate maybe an

978
00:44:04,380 --> 00:44:07,109
optimistic or realistic estimate on the

979
00:44:07,109 --> 00:44:10,560
timeline how far is the research so so

980
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:12,750
if I was president of the world will

981
00:44:12,750 --> 00:44:15,830
have it in 2050

982
00:44:15,830 --> 00:44:22,520
[Applause]

983
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:24,470
it really depends very much on the

984
00:44:24,470 --> 00:44:26,090
decisions that are taken on a global

985
00:44:26,090 --> 00:44:28,700
scale in these days just look at the new

986
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:31,220
US administration and some movements

987
00:44:31,220 --> 00:44:33,260
here in Europe that are detrimental to

988
00:44:33,260 --> 00:44:37,220
the efforts of gaining more knowledge so

989
00:44:37,220 --> 00:44:39,200
but if we take the path of knowledge I'm

990
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:40,850
pretty sure that we'll have moon probe

991
00:44:40,850 --> 00:44:42,500
well these are plans have a moon program

992
00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:45,530
in the 2030s and the moon village will

993
00:44:45,530 --> 00:44:48,470
be implemented that Ian Verna will talk

994
00:44:48,470 --> 00:44:49,850
about I'm pretty sure we'll have a

995
00:44:49,850 --> 00:44:51,080
permanent settlement on the moon

996
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:54,830
somewhere in the mid 2030s and then and

997
00:44:54,830 --> 00:44:57,380
then the necessity of having an

998
00:44:57,380 --> 00:45:00,170
efficient transport system will force

999
00:45:00,170 --> 00:45:01,730
people to build a space elevator and

1000
00:45:01,730 --> 00:45:05,870
that will be then 2050 and I plan on

1001
00:45:05,870 --> 00:45:12,020
being around that long Mike number four

1002
00:45:12,020 --> 00:45:14,540
please on the topic of focusing

1003
00:45:14,540 --> 00:45:15,830
resources so we talked about the

1004
00:45:15,830 --> 00:45:17,930
cost-effectiveness of rockets but we

1005
00:45:17,930 --> 00:45:19,760
didn't talk about redeem reusable

1006
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:22,160
rockets as push for now by Elon Musk and

1007
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:23,660
SpaceX as wondering if you could talk

1008
00:45:23,660 --> 00:45:26,150
about the cost-effectiveness of reusable

1009
00:45:26,150 --> 00:45:28,490
rockets versus space elevators in terms

1010
00:45:28,490 --> 00:45:30,440
of focusing our resources that we have

1011
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:32,450
currently right great question thank you

1012
00:45:32,450 --> 00:45:36,230
we know from Elon that that Rockets

1013
00:45:36,230 --> 00:45:38,360
reusable rockets out about 30 percent

1014
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:40,760
better than non your reusable ones right

1015
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:44,540
so that brings down anything back to the

1016
00:45:44,540 --> 00:45:50,140
moon from 10 million to nine hundred

1017
00:45:50,140 --> 00:45:53,810
nine million seven hundred thousand per

1018
00:45:53,810 --> 00:45:56,690
kilogram so that's great but it's still

1019
00:45:56,690 --> 00:45:58,970
rocket technology the space elevators

1020
00:45:58,970 --> 00:46:00,740
are estimated to lower that by a factor

1021
00:46:00,740 --> 00:46:06,140
of 100 now that includes the initial

1022
00:46:06,140 --> 00:46:10,310
investment but assuming that the initial

1023
00:46:10,310 --> 00:46:12,680
investment will be less than 10 percent

1024
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:16,370
of the turnover so the turnover of

1025
00:46:16,370 --> 00:46:20,000
course you have to put a lot of business

1026
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,730
in it to make it work and that's that's

1027
00:46:22,730 --> 00:46:24,110
the problem with the space elevator if

1028
00:46:24,110 --> 00:46:25,850
there is not enough business for it to

1029
00:46:25,850 --> 00:46:30,430
do then people will never engage in it

1030
00:46:30,580 --> 00:46:32,290
Mike numbers

1031
00:46:32,290 --> 00:46:35,500
please so thanks for the talk at first

1032
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:39,370
and so from our talk I guess that the

1033
00:46:39,370 --> 00:46:41,590
moon elevator is currently already

1034
00:46:41,590 --> 00:46:45,010
technically feasible or buildable so are

1035
00:46:45,010 --> 00:46:48,300
there any plans or what's the timeline

1036
00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:51,610
there the ISA has not been it does not

1037
00:46:51,610 --> 00:46:54,310
have any a space elevator program we

1038
00:46:54,310 --> 00:46:56,380
have made a couple of experiments with

1039
00:46:56,380 --> 00:46:58,990
space tethers that were quite successful

1040
00:46:58,990 --> 00:47:01,180
and we have that in our knowledge base

1041
00:47:01,180 --> 00:47:03,670
the reason why ISA is not engaging in it

1042
00:47:03,670 --> 00:47:06,010
is because our task is to enable

1043
00:47:06,010 --> 00:47:09,480
research for our member states and

1044
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:12,040
research is not the prime target of the

1045
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:15,460
space elevator there is a space elevator

1046
00:47:15,460 --> 00:47:17,530
consortium and you will find something

1047
00:47:17,530 --> 00:47:20,800
on the for example here the one that I

1048
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:24,160
showed the lift port comm you will find

1049
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:25,810
that they have a timeline in them and

1050
00:47:25,810 --> 00:47:28,480
it's a private consortium and their plan

1051
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:31,210
is to make a business case for the space

1052
00:47:31,210 --> 00:47:35,740
elevator mic number two please thank you

1053
00:47:35,740 --> 00:47:38,560
at first thank you for the nice talk I

1054
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:41,230
have the question they have often the

1055
00:47:41,230 --> 00:47:43,450
argument that we shouldn't engage in

1056
00:47:43,450 --> 00:47:45,490
human space travel because of the costs

1057
00:47:45,490 --> 00:47:47,920
and the risks and it's really really

1058
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:52,330
hard what would you give as an argument

1059
00:47:52,330 --> 00:47:55,030
against that so I'm in space business

1060
00:47:55,030 --> 00:47:57,520
since 16 years so I have answered that

1061
00:47:57,520 --> 00:47:59,080
question a couple of times so forgive me

1062
00:47:59,080 --> 00:48:01,420
if I feel a little bit superior at this

1063
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:05,890
stage so so first of all the cost is not

1064
00:48:05,890 --> 00:48:07,930
tremendously high and don't forget any

1065
00:48:07,930 --> 00:48:10,420
euro to use put in a space program does

1066
00:48:10,420 --> 00:48:13,360
not go to space the euro stays here and

1067
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:15,850
we've done a benefit analysis by ISA

1068
00:48:15,850 --> 00:48:18,280
that roughly for each euro invested by

1069
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:21,340
our Member States they get 5 euros back

1070
00:48:21,340 --> 00:48:23,560
and I can tell you about the deals that

1071
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:26,650
they tell us a few if you want the

1072
00:48:26,650 --> 00:48:29,320
second thing is that that space is right

1073
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:32,020
now we're looking at about one percent

1074
00:48:32,020 --> 00:48:34,030
or less than one much less than 1% of

1075
00:48:34,030 --> 00:48:36,730
national spending so there is not a big

1076
00:48:36,730 --> 00:48:38,830
part of the national budget the third

1077
00:48:38,830 --> 00:48:40,870
point about the risk is human space

1078
00:48:40,870 --> 00:48:42,460
flight risk is really only to the

1079
00:48:42,460 --> 00:48:43,920
astronauts and they

1080
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:45,540
have a contract that says you have a

1081
00:48:45,540 --> 00:48:47,910
risky job are you ready to take that

1082
00:48:47,910 --> 00:48:50,069
risk and they say oh yeah sure I got you

1083
00:48:50,069 --> 00:48:53,130
don't go ahead and so that's the risk

1084
00:48:53,130 --> 00:48:59,099
bit and that was it right yeah as all to

1085
00:48:59,099 --> 00:49:01,369
the point that we can do it without

1086
00:49:01,369 --> 00:49:06,059
humans or people tell me I'm not really

1087
00:49:06,059 --> 00:49:08,520
behind the right guy under said tell me

1088
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:10,530
it you can do it without you and so why

1089
00:49:10,530 --> 00:49:13,049
don't we try it so I cannot exclude that

1090
00:49:13,049 --> 00:49:15,030
possibility that some day we will have

1091
00:49:15,030 --> 00:49:17,819
intelligent machines but I've tried to

1092
00:49:17,819 --> 00:49:21,420
know I've pulled a security camera the

1093
00:49:21,420 --> 00:49:24,450
other day by just having my glass my

1094
00:49:24,450 --> 00:49:27,240
shades hanging out of my mouth right not

1095
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:28,980
putting them on just put them in your

1096
00:49:28,980 --> 00:49:31,530
mouth no security camera will recognize

1097
00:49:31,530 --> 00:49:35,460
your face so so that tells you there is

1098
00:49:35,460 --> 00:49:37,859
not intelligent computers today because

1099
00:49:37,859 --> 00:49:40,020
the security sector has billions and

1100
00:49:40,020 --> 00:49:42,349
billions of euros to spend on this stuff

1101
00:49:42,349 --> 00:49:45,960
and you know like I said in my beginning

1102
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:48,780
in 1972 there was an article which said

1103
00:49:48,780 --> 00:49:50,880
that there will be intelligent robots

1104
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:53,520
very soon and I am still waiting for

1105
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:55,710
them I'm sorry but it could be there in

1106
00:49:55,710 --> 00:49:59,760
20 years no it could be thank you could

1107
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:02,309
we get the internet please if this is a

1108
00:50:02,309 --> 00:50:04,559
quite practical question who were to

1109
00:50:04,559 --> 00:50:07,859
deploy and fix the cable yeah that's a

1110
00:50:07,859 --> 00:50:09,359
brilliant question and I skipped that in

1111
00:50:09,359 --> 00:50:10,760
my talk and apologies for that

1112
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:13,200
Thanks and that's why the question

1113
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:15,299
against me announced opportunity to

1114
00:50:15,299 --> 00:50:17,930
answer it so the rocket would bring

1115
00:50:17,930 --> 00:50:21,150
roughly a hundred to a thousand ton

1116
00:50:21,150 --> 00:50:23,490
cable to the libration point to the

1117
00:50:23,490 --> 00:50:25,470
stable point that I showed before and

1118
00:50:25,470 --> 00:50:27,809
then from that point on the cable would

1119
00:50:27,809 --> 00:50:30,299
be deployed at same rate upwards and

1120
00:50:30,299 --> 00:50:32,250
downwards maintaining the center of

1121
00:50:32,250 --> 00:50:34,770
gravity at that stable point and doing a

1122
00:50:34,770 --> 00:50:36,059
little bit of station keeping not too

1123
00:50:36,059 --> 00:50:38,520
much and once deployed will stay there

1124
00:50:38,520 --> 00:50:41,160
for decades so so then after that you

1125
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:43,260
can launch another rocket very small one

1126
00:50:43,260 --> 00:50:45,000
with the with the climber and fly around

1127
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,190
if you attach it and then it could go up

1128
00:50:47,190 --> 00:50:50,760
and down any time so it's really and I

1129
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:53,490
would refer the the person who has asked

1130
00:50:53,490 --> 00:50:55,650
a question also to the

1131
00:50:55,650 --> 00:50:57,690
space elevator Ricky that I'm listing

1132
00:50:57,690 --> 00:50:59,549
here on my links because there is some

1133
00:50:59,549 --> 00:51:03,630
some information there Mike number three

1134
00:51:03,630 --> 00:51:06,719
please um hi I have two questions the

1135
00:51:06,719 --> 00:51:09,089
first one is um how are we going to

1136
00:51:09,089 --> 00:51:10,859
build the cable is it are we

1137
00:51:10,859 --> 00:51:13,079
transporting materials from earth to

1138
00:51:13,079 --> 00:51:14,999
moon or are we going to mine it from

1139
00:51:14,999 --> 00:51:18,479
there and the second question is how are

1140
00:51:18,479 --> 00:51:20,430
we gonna build the cable are we using

1141
00:51:20,430 --> 00:51:23,819
like 3d printers alright so so first

1142
00:51:23,819 --> 00:51:25,920
part of the question both options exist

1143
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:28,559
so you can bring everything from Earth

1144
00:51:28,559 --> 00:51:31,589
there that's the more expensive way but

1145
00:51:31,589 --> 00:51:35,460
the more safe way the other alternative

1146
00:51:35,460 --> 00:51:37,170
is you bring a small pilot cable and

1147
00:51:37,170 --> 00:51:39,479
then you start building strands of the

1148
00:51:39,479 --> 00:51:41,789
cable and pull it along the pilot cable

1149
00:51:41,789 --> 00:51:44,400
up and then make a thicker cable out of

1150
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:47,249
the pilot cable through through a that's

1151
00:51:47,249 --> 00:51:50,789
cheaper and less risky one and yes 3d

1152
00:51:50,789 --> 00:51:52,799
printing is definitely an option and I

1153
00:51:52,799 --> 00:51:54,599
actually deleted one slide that showed

1154
00:51:54,599 --> 00:51:56,119
how the structure of the cable is

1155
00:51:56,119 --> 00:51:58,619
because I wanted more of your questions

1156
00:51:58,619 --> 00:52:04,499
so I deleted slides so so the the idea

1157
00:52:04,499 --> 00:52:06,539
is to have like a criss crossing set of

1158
00:52:06,539 --> 00:52:08,700
strands that would allow the breakage of

1159
00:52:08,700 --> 00:52:11,640
one strand without the cable breaking or

1160
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:13,349
you can make it the breakage of five

1161
00:52:13,349 --> 00:52:15,749
strands without breaking of the cable

1162
00:52:15,749 --> 00:52:18,269
and by that way and also that would

1163
00:52:18,269 --> 00:52:21,390
allow then crews to go up and refix the

1164
00:52:21,390 --> 00:52:23,400
cable if there's a broken strand it

1165
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:26,160
would go up displays the cable and then

1166
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:30,119
get the strand out put insert the new

1167
00:52:30,119 --> 00:52:32,819
splice and pull a new cable fring and

1168
00:52:32,819 --> 00:52:39,479
adjust the tension on it recon could we

1169
00:52:39,479 --> 00:52:44,789
get number six please alicyclic I've

1170
00:52:44,789 --> 00:52:47,849
written about Thornton of Paradise and

1171
00:52:47,849 --> 00:52:51,809
where you scribed elevator concept and

1172
00:52:51,809 --> 00:52:54,930
they have many Papers written about this

1173
00:52:54,930 --> 00:52:57,660
concept to were using hyperbolic

1174
00:52:57,660 --> 00:53:01,140
structures like all independent all in

1175
00:53:01,140 --> 00:53:03,910
drilling platform are using is also

1176
00:53:03,910 --> 00:53:06,039
and I would like to know that you have

1177
00:53:06,039 --> 00:53:08,140
you already calculated an equation how

1178
00:53:08,140 --> 00:53:11,940
much how much time would you take to

1179
00:53:11,940 --> 00:53:15,630
lift up a human being from earth to moon

1180
00:53:15,630 --> 00:53:21,430
and the see global space exploration

1181
00:53:21,430 --> 00:53:24,369
strategy is this because it looks like

1182
00:53:24,369 --> 00:53:26,799
the International Space Station will be

1183
00:53:26,799 --> 00:53:32,220
up until 2025 at least the financing is

1184
00:53:32,220 --> 00:53:35,619
secured until then and what it will be

1185
00:53:35,619 --> 00:53:37,869
after next is this also possible to use

1186
00:53:37,869 --> 00:53:42,190
the ISS for as a springboard as is often

1187
00:53:42,190 --> 00:53:45,670
mentioned to the moon okay thanks so it

1188
00:53:45,670 --> 00:53:48,220
three parts right so yes I know found of

1189
00:53:48,220 --> 00:53:49,750
paradise very good book and it's really

1190
00:53:49,750 --> 00:53:52,529
about the economic and socio-economic

1191
00:53:52,529 --> 00:53:55,119
impact of a space elevator so that's

1192
00:53:55,119 --> 00:53:56,559
very interesting thanks of mentioning

1193
00:53:56,559 --> 00:53:59,259
that now the technical solutions and

1194
00:53:59,259 --> 00:54:00,609
discussions that are in this book and

1195
00:54:00,609 --> 00:54:03,640
arthur c clarke is an engineer are very

1196
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:05,529
interesting and honestly i haven't

1197
00:54:05,529 --> 00:54:08,710
looked into them so so very much there's

1198
00:54:08,710 --> 00:54:10,480
a lot of interesting solutions there for

1199
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:13,299
the anchor point the second part of the

1200
00:54:13,299 --> 00:54:16,210
question was about the the travel time

1201
00:54:16,210 --> 00:54:17,559
and that was answered by a colleague

1202
00:54:17,559 --> 00:54:19,299
before so we're talking about months if

1203
00:54:19,299 --> 00:54:21,099
you have a slow elevator you can speed

1204
00:54:21,099 --> 00:54:22,779
it up you know you were in vacuum so you

1205
00:54:22,779 --> 00:54:24,569
can go a thousand kilometers an hour

1206
00:54:24,569 --> 00:54:28,920
without too much damaging your haircut

1207
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:31,869
so so that would work so cut it down

1208
00:54:31,869 --> 00:54:34,539
from couple months to a couple weeks and

1209
00:54:34,539 --> 00:54:36,700
the third question was the global space

1210
00:54:36,700 --> 00:54:38,319
exploration is the international space

1211
00:54:38,319 --> 00:54:39,900
exploration coordination group and

1212
00:54:39,900 --> 00:54:42,279
thanks for that question because in that

1213
00:54:42,279 --> 00:54:43,990
group we're preparing the next steps

1214
00:54:43,990 --> 00:54:46,059
issa together with NASA with Waze Kosmos

1215
00:54:46,059 --> 00:54:48,670
with the Chinese Space Agency and the

1216
00:54:48,670 --> 00:54:50,640
next step will very likely be the

1217
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:54,940
creation of a small staging outpost in

1218
00:54:54,940 --> 00:54:57,539
cislunar space

1219
00:54:57,900 --> 00:55:01,750
could we get microphone number one place

1220
00:55:01,750 --> 00:55:05,290
okay thank you um two small questions

1221
00:55:05,290 --> 00:55:07,660
the first month once might seem a little

1222
00:55:07,660 --> 00:55:10,890
naive but once the elevator is in place

1223
00:55:10,890 --> 00:55:13,869
to climb up the elevator wouldn't that

1224
00:55:13,869 --> 00:55:16,330
apply a downward momentum how do you

1225
00:55:16,330 --> 00:55:18,220
keep the L of the row pants in place

1226
00:55:18,220 --> 00:55:22,810
right yes but it's so small that the the

1227
00:55:22,810 --> 00:55:25,840
phorid one-ton cabin you would have a

1228
00:55:25,840 --> 00:55:32,050
you would have a thousand ton cable no

1229
00:55:32,050 --> 00:55:34,990
it's a two ton the tootin climber would

1230
00:55:34,990 --> 00:55:38,050
have a thousand ton cable and simply

1231
00:55:38,050 --> 00:55:39,880
because of the mass how it works out and

1232
00:55:39,880 --> 00:55:43,090
you can check the papers so the co G

1233
00:55:43,090 --> 00:55:45,430
would goes little bit slower lower and

1234
00:55:45,430 --> 00:55:47,440
you can compensate that by a little bit

1235
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:50,650
of motion below it's it's it's intricate

1236
00:55:50,650 --> 00:55:53,740
so the horizontal motion by a mobile

1237
00:55:53,740 --> 00:55:55,810
platform that travels a hundred meters

1238
00:55:55,810 --> 00:55:58,450
on the lunar surface can compensate can

1239
00:55:58,450 --> 00:56:02,740
provide the energy to attach it once you

1240
00:56:02,740 --> 00:56:07,869
have attached this this cabin then it

1241
00:56:07,869 --> 00:56:09,700
climbs up and the co G will approach

1242
00:56:09,700 --> 00:56:11,950
again its original state but these are

1243
00:56:11,950 --> 00:56:14,200
menu changes and mainly they they cause

1244
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:16,000
oscillations that didn't have to be

1245
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:19,540
managed in horizontal mode okay and the

1246
00:56:19,540 --> 00:56:22,720
other question was say we managed to

1247
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:25,810
build an elevator on the moon but the

1248
00:56:25,810 --> 00:56:27,339
whole technical thing for the earth just

1249
00:56:27,339 --> 00:56:29,170
doesn't work our and so we are stuck

1250
00:56:29,170 --> 00:56:30,910
with just an elevator on the moon yes

1251
00:56:30,910 --> 00:56:33,940
how useful would that actually be so so

1252
00:56:33,940 --> 00:56:36,700
the usefulness of that let me get back

1253
00:56:36,700 --> 00:56:42,880
to that image is this so you cut the the

1254
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:47,230
the Delta V in half and abling reusable

1255
00:56:47,230 --> 00:56:49,930
rockets going to and from the moon so it

1256
00:56:49,930 --> 00:56:52,990
will be about half as expensive as it is

1257
00:56:52,990 --> 00:56:54,640
today so you're cutting from ten million

1258
00:56:54,640 --> 00:56:57,070
to five million is that enough for

1259
00:56:57,070 --> 00:56:58,589
economy I don't know

1260
00:56:58,589 --> 00:57:01,300
so it would be better but it wouldn't

1261
00:57:01,300 --> 00:57:03,339
solve the problem at all

1262
00:57:03,339 --> 00:57:05,160
exactly it comes like okay thank you

1263
00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:09,130
number two please so you talked about

1264
00:57:09,130 --> 00:57:12,490
economy and I wondered is there any

1265
00:57:12,490 --> 00:57:14,050
concerns about who are

1266
00:57:14,050 --> 00:57:16,870
the moon or may we face the next war on

1267
00:57:16,870 --> 00:57:21,280
resources in 2050 that there is a there

1268
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:23,500
is a consensus officially by the UN

1269
00:57:23,500 --> 00:57:25,840
which means that nobody can no nation

1270
00:57:25,840 --> 00:57:28,360
can own the moon and that includes by

1271
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:30,010
the way private companies because each

1272
00:57:30,010 --> 00:57:32,250
private company has to have its legal

1273
00:57:32,250 --> 00:57:36,910
framework set up by a nation but of

1274
00:57:36,910 --> 00:57:38,740
course you know things always go

1275
00:57:38,740 --> 00:57:41,530
different than the official ways and

1276
00:57:41,530 --> 00:57:43,420
already now all there is a lot of

1277
00:57:43,420 --> 00:57:45,550
discussion about who owns the moon and I

1278
00:57:45,550 --> 00:57:48,930
think we'll have to wait for the war

1279
00:57:49,710 --> 00:57:52,830
maybe that's a chance to occupy the moon

1280
00:57:52,830 --> 00:57:55,240
could we could we get a question from

1281
00:57:55,240 --> 00:58:01,900
the internet traveling from wooden back

1282
00:58:01,900 --> 00:58:04,180
to Earth via elevator would you mainly

1283
00:58:04,180 --> 00:58:06,610
see atmosphere to break or what you have

1284
00:58:06,610 --> 00:58:09,550
to have some propellant you don't need

1285
00:58:09,550 --> 00:58:11,980
either because when you go down on the

1286
00:58:11,980 --> 00:58:14,260
cable you will co-rotating

1287
00:58:14,260 --> 00:58:16,570
with earth so unless there is a

1288
00:58:16,570 --> 00:58:17,830
high-altitude wind

1289
00:58:17,830 --> 00:58:19,030
there will be no friction with the

1290
00:58:19,030 --> 00:58:21,250
atmosphere so which basically go that

1291
00:58:21,250 --> 00:58:23,410
the air will become ever denser as you

1292
00:58:23,410 --> 00:58:29,280
go down you know basically the first 140

1293
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:35,290
140 or man 130,000 no this marathon

1294
00:58:35,290 --> 00:58:37,780
stage is just terrible mental math on

1295
00:58:37,780 --> 00:58:41,530
stage you should try it one day so so

1296
00:58:41,530 --> 00:58:45,160
the first 99.99% of the cable you'll be

1297
00:58:45,160 --> 00:58:48,550
in vacuum and then the last bit the last

1298
00:58:48,550 --> 00:58:52,120
30 kilometers so so you know 144,000

1299
00:58:52,120 --> 00:58:55,240
minus 30 the last 30 kilometers you

1300
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:56,920
would be in the air and then you would

1301
00:58:56,920 --> 00:58:59,380
feel the air becoming thicker and of

1302
00:58:59,380 --> 00:59:00,550
course high in the atmosphere you have

1303
00:59:00,550 --> 00:59:01,990
some winds you know you have the jet

1304
00:59:01,990 --> 00:59:04,180
stream but at that stage you will still

1305
00:59:04,180 --> 00:59:06,190
be in your little cabin until you reach

1306
00:59:06,190 --> 00:59:09,520
about 3000 meters when you can basically

1307
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:12,910
get off the lift if you want one last

1308
00:59:12,910 --> 00:59:14,470
question from number one place make a

1309
00:59:14,470 --> 00:59:17,110
chart if you can of course Thank You mr.

1310
00:59:17,110 --> 00:59:20,040
president for the nice talk

1311
00:59:20,040 --> 00:59:26,560
actually my question is quite similar to

1312
00:59:26,560 --> 00:59:29,350
the one from Mike to just now but not

1313
00:59:29,350 --> 00:59:31,360
the question who would own the moon but

1314
00:59:31,360 --> 00:59:34,630
who would own the elevator because if

1315
00:59:34,630 --> 00:59:36,390
you're not the president of the world

1316
00:59:36,390 --> 00:59:40,090
obviously in space things go far better

1317
00:59:40,090 --> 00:59:43,060
together than on earth like an ISS and

1318
00:59:43,060 --> 00:59:45,940
something but due to the cost of the

1319
00:59:45,940 --> 00:59:48,040
elevator what do you think will be a

1320
00:59:48,040 --> 00:59:50,440
public project like with either NASA or

1321
00:59:50,440 --> 00:59:51,970
will it be something like SpaceX on

1322
00:59:51,970 --> 00:59:53,650
private investors that's it that's a

1323
00:59:53,650 --> 00:59:56,440
very interesting question my my protein

1324
00:59:56,440 --> 00:59:58,680
I I really haven't thought this through

1325
00:59:58,680 --> 01:00:01,810
but my answer would be very likely it's

1326
01:00:01,810 --> 01:00:03,640
going to be private because the benefits

1327
01:00:03,640 --> 01:00:07,300
are really intrepid newer benefits by

1328
01:00:07,300 --> 01:00:08,890
getting material from the moon or

1329
01:00:08,890 --> 01:00:10,870
building big infrastructures in space

1330
01:00:10,870 --> 01:00:15,040
that offer services so so I would guess

1331
01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:16,450
would be private and then your question

1332
01:00:16,450 --> 01:00:18,460
is very relevant because it's a huge

1333
01:00:18,460 --> 01:00:22,510
powerful piece of infrastructure is that

1334
01:00:22,510 --> 01:00:24,460
even possible to have a private entity

1335
01:00:24,460 --> 01:00:28,060
owning it without interfering with

1336
01:00:28,060 --> 01:00:29,680
national interests international

1337
01:00:29,680 --> 01:00:31,960
strategic interests because in the end

1338
01:00:31,960 --> 01:00:33,370
you could bomb any place on the earth

1339
01:00:33,370 --> 01:00:35,950
from that elevator if you want so

1340
01:00:35,950 --> 01:00:37,870
perhaps some nations are not very happy

1341
01:00:37,870 --> 01:00:39,670
to have a private company controlling

1342
01:00:39,670 --> 01:00:41,470
this thing and that is a little bit also

1343
01:00:41,470 --> 01:00:43,990
addressed if you if you read arthur c

1344
01:00:43,990 --> 01:00:45,880
clarke fountain of paradise because then

1345
01:00:45,880 --> 01:00:49,120
this whole problem becomes very clear

1346
01:00:49,120 --> 01:00:50,500
and I had that I don't have a good

1347
01:00:50,500 --> 01:00:54,460
answer for you sorry thank you so we out

1348
01:00:54,460 --> 01:00:55,810
of time please thank our future

1349
01:00:55,810 --> 01:00:57,440
president

1350
01:00:57,440 --> 01:01:05,890
