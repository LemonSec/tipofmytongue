could download these signature sheets

00:10:53,200 --> 00:11:03,340
there's a small note and nothing else

171
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:06,790
so we also developed a tool to help us

172
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:09,610
keep track of the paperwork because<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

173
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:12,550
we have to develop our own<font color="#E5E5E5"> because even</font>

174
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:15,610
though this software exists from other

parties<font color="#E5E5E5"> they didn't want to give it to</font>

00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:23,650
us in case it fell into the wrong hands

177
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:25,630
so now we have this<font color="#E5E5E5"> self-written</font>

00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:28,090
software which actually Patrick<font color="#E5E5E5"> here</font>

so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Conservative Party's fought or</font>

183
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:49,240
did very very little until the end and

184
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:52,750
that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite a damper for us we</font>

00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:55,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">mobilized everything and invested a lot</font>

186
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:59,080
but together with the digital society

187
00:11:55,420 --> 00:12:05,410
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Amnesty International we created a</font>

video to explain to people what this

<font color="#E5E5E5">still looking</font>

203
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:57,149
there we go<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright it's not my laptop</font>

204
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:59,790
see so so we were talking about<font color="#CCCCCC"> their</font>

205
00:13:57,149 --> 00:14:03,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">conservative</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> parties and it to betray</font>

206
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:07,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">there was this core group and they did a</font>

207
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:09,359
lot but all<font color="#CCCCCC"> altogether the conservative</font>

208
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:12,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">parties which were helping out only</font>

209
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:15,899
reached<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> third of their quota of the of</font>

210
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:18,690
what they promised<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that was a big</font>

211
00:14:15,899 --> 00:14:20,880
problem and it would be a big part of

212
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:22,680
why we failed to get enough signatures

213
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:26,220
for the referendum<font color="#CCCCCC"> we didn't know that</font>

214
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:30,810
at the time and we talked about it and

215
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:35,520
we got a tip to hire people who go

216
00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:39,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">collect signatures but that means</font>

217
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:42,689
gathering a lot a lot of money and that

218
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:46,830
was already<font color="#E5E5E5"> recognized as being a</font>

219
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:50,459
crucial moment and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> had to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> immobilize</font>

220
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:52,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">over 30,000 swiss francs in short amount</font>

221
00:14:50,459 --> 00:14:54,750
of times but we managed and then the

222
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:59,670
next question was who would be higher

223
00:14:54,750 --> 00:15:02,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">and we found two organizations and the</font>

224
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:07,469
couple of students from various students

225
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:08,849
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> well we still</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> managed and it will be</font>

226
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:10,709
interesting to look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> house with in</font>

00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:14,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">Switzerland you can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> organize such a</font>

229
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:20,939
on the final stretch at<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we got more</font>

230
00:15:17,579 --> 00:15:25,229
and more signatures and we had people

231
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:27,000
working day and night to verify the

232
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:29,730
signatures and I really want to thank

233
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:33,510
every single one of those people that's

<font color="#CCCCCC">be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> deserves a big big big thank you</font>

236
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:43,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">verifying those signatures</font>

237
00:15:39,529 --> 00:15:49,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">we were working and it was raining and</font>

238
00:15:43,639 --> 00:15:53,240
we gathered and gathered<font color="#CCCCCC"> like crazy and</font>

239
00:15:49,310 --> 00:16:00,079
then we get the news that something

240
00:15:53,240 --> 00:16:04,249
wasn't working out<font color="#E5E5E5"> daily</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> wee-wee-wee-wee</font>

241
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:11,029
had to do a lot of work

242
00:16:04,249 --> 00:16:17,809
it was a nightmare and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> D</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> everything</font>

243
00:16:11,029 --> 00:16:19,129
was organized very broadly and and agile

244
00:16:17,809 --> 00:16:21,589
early and suddenly turn into a

245
00:16:19,129 --> 00:16:22,999
bureaucratic monster and there were

246
00:16:21,589 --> 00:16:27,589
people who wouldn't even acknowledge

247
00:16:22,999 --> 00:16:34,550
being connected and that took a lot of

248
00:16:27,589 --> 00:16:39,139
time and a lot of people try to go

249
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:45,439
figure out why<font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> help was rejected and</font>

250
00:16:39,139 --> 00:16:47,480
we went there and<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're that was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

252
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:53,930
we had<font color="#CCCCCC"> a contract</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> guaranteeing a certain</font>

00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:57,439
wasn't there

255

things weren't there we tried to

256
00:16:57,439 --> 00:17:03,469
organize everything at short notice but

257
00:17:00,559 --> 00:17:06,648
some of us were even such<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the shock</font>

00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:11,899
that we really just<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to sit back and</font>

269
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:52,250
that led to a big consternation

270
00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:59,870
and we didn't feel good about it and we

271
00:17:52,250 --> 00:18:02,090
roughly had<font color="#E5E5E5"> 55 thousand signatures and</font>

272
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:05,659
we went and handed it in

how<font color="#CCCCCC"> we use the tools of our democracy to</font>

289
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:19,879
fight against mass surveillance but we

00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:26,000
also have<font color="#E5E5E5"> different approach by</font>

00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:31,309
basically going the way of the courts<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a quick summary of what metadata</font>

about<font color="#CCCCCC"> 48</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> weeks in in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Switzerland it's</font>

more like six months<font color="#CCCCCC"> versus 12 years</font>

298
00:19:47,929 --> 00:19:59,610
well fortunately we will manage to get

299
00:19:50,750 --> 00:20:02,520
that bit thrown out so so we

300
00:19:59,610 --> 00:20:05,939
<font color="#CCCCCC">attacked the service that collects the</font>

301
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:09,059
metadata for the government and asked

302
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:13,770
for the data about six individual people

303
00:20:09,059 --> 00:20:17,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">this service from the government</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> then</font>

304
00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:26,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">follow through and so we came to the</font>

305
00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:29,429
federal court and they discussed our

306
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:32,970
case for a long time and extended the

307
00:20:29,429 --> 00:20:35,760

309
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:43,200
happens<font color="#CCCCCC"> so this is actually the first</font>

310
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:48,418
legal case in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Switzerland which actually</font>

311
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:54,840
says that that mass surveillance is a

00:20:48,419 --> 00:20:59,549
serious<font color="#CCCCCC"> offense against a privacy so</font>

313
00:20:54,840 --> 00:21:03,299
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is what we received and now for a</font>

314
00:20:59,549 --> 00:21:07,440
few weeks we went to the Supreme Court

of<font color="#CCCCCC"> switzerland and well we expect that</font>

exempt from mass surveillance but of

318
00:21:14,309 --> 00:21:21,418
course that's not what we want

free all the Swiss people from<font color="#CCCCCC"> mass</font>

327
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:56,010
so they they could remove just the six

330
00:21:57,780 --> 00:22:05,910
unlikely or the other way would be to

00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:13,439
<font color="#CCCCCC">the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> throw out the law together</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">of course if you remove all those six</font>

333
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:18,990
people from mass surveillance

334
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:23,160
why would you remove any others from

335
00:22:18,990 --> 00:22:27,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">Maxwell's it stays exciting but it's</font>

336
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:31,140
going to take some more time<font color="#CCCCCC"> we only</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">move</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> towards the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Supreme Court a few</font>

338
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:35,550
days ago so everything of this is going

339
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:37,800
to take some more time<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

00:22:35,550 --> 00:22:48,510
that's it for me<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I'm going to hand</font>

it over back to<font color="#CCCCCC"> Patrick again</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

344
00:22:59,610 --> 00:23:04,469
because for politicians they are a tool

345
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:06,420
to keep us all safe and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then reality</font>

346
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:10,470
they look more like the image which is

347
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:20,550
so in reality we've also reached the

348
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:22,950
gambling laws and the goal of these laws

349
00:23:20,550 --> 00:23:27,450
is to protect gamblers from themselves

350
00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:34,290
all the gambling<font color="#CCCCCC"> winds should</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be treated</font>

351
00:23:27,450 --> 00:23:40,740
the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> currently casinos are not taxed</font>

352
00:23:34,290 --> 00:23:46,080
and online gambling should be permitted

353
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:52,860
and the same as has been done too often

354
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:54,929
casinos<font color="#E5E5E5"> should be kept our main</font>

355
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:57,240
criticism of this law is in fact that

356
00:23:54,930 --> 00:24:00,750
there are that currently they are trying

357
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:04,620
to block<font color="#E5E5E5"> non-licensed online games and</font>

that requires<font color="#E5E5E5"> firewall infrastructure</font>

basically not realized that the gambling

00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:58,159
laws would affect them at all then there

382
00:25:55,639 --> 00:26:01,728

388
00:26:14,599 --> 00:26:21,649
was to strengthen the laws of the the

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea was to have a more modern</font>

ensure that this bit of information can

a judge can access the meta data from

a lot of individuals also libraries and

00:34:10,418 --> 00:34:18,429
commented that it's stupid that there's

basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> reform is is good</font>

519
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:48,460
different opinions about how this reform

should be made so officially<font color="#CCCCCC"> there is</font>

526
00:35:02,619 --> 00:35:11,320
so I've made a summary of what we want

00:35:07,030 --> 00:35:12,770
so we want don't want any net bands<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

00:35:17,390 --> 00:35:23,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">currently is so I mean the revision</font>

00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:27,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">won't explicitly criminalize the</font>

532
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:30,500
downloads but you have to kind of

533
00:35:27,170 --> 00:35:32,780

incorrectly and of course that means the

706
00:46:56,490 --> 00:47:04,799

746
00:49:22,230 --> 00:49:36,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so question from the audience so to</font>

747
00:49:32,130 --> 00:49:39,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">Sabrina</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> he you said something about that</font>

748
00:49:36,030 --> 00:49:40,859
referendum before you said there was

749
00:49:39,060 --> 00:49:43,680
some sabotage with<font color="#CCCCCC"> a part of the</font>

750
00:49:40,859 --> 00:49:45,840
signature so<font color="#CCCCCC"> what what's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up with that</font>

751
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:47,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">were those</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> servitors or just people</font>

752
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:52,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">trying to make a quick buck</font>

753
00:49:47,910 --> 00:49:54,390
well this is a question we asked

754
00:49:52,650 --> 00:49:57,960
ourselves there are some very emotional

755
00:49:54,390 --> 00:50:00,720
responsible<font color="#E5E5E5"> the the correct response i</font>

756
00:49:57,960 --> 00:50:04,650
can give you<font color="#E5E5E5"> is these are people who</font>

757
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:07,589
made a contract with us and they told us

758
00:50:04,650 --> 00:50:09,780
that they<font color="#E5E5E5"> have these numbers and and in</font>

759
00:50:07,590 --> 00:50:13,020
fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe they were simply just</font>

760
00:50:09,780 --> 00:50:15,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">overwhelmed and by the talks and then we</font>

761
00:50:13,020 --> 00:50:33,480
can really say anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> as to their</font>

762
00:50:15,540 --> 00:50:35,460
motive so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i would like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to ask about the</font>

763
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:41,430
data protection law

764
00:50:35,460 --> 00:50:43,859
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'm surprised actually very surprised</font>

765
00:50:41,430 --> 00:50:46,470
because I have a little bit to do with

766
00:50:43,859 --> 00:50:50,009
that and<font color="#CCCCCC"> finish dealing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with this for</font>

767
00:50:46,470 --> 00:50:53,279
quite<font color="#E5E5E5"> some time that Switzerland seems</font>

768
00:50:50,010 --> 00:50:59,369
to be having this highly backwards law

769
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:59,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">up to now</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and how did that happened how</font>

770
00:50:59,369 --> 00:51:03,180
come

771
00:50:59,850 --> 00:51:04,529
<font color="#CCCCCC">switzerland is behind on that part of</font>

772
00:51:03,180 --> 00:51:08,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">law</font>

773
00:51:04,530 --> 00:51:11,609
well generally can say that system works

774
00:51:08,790 --> 00:51:13,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">but it works slowly direct democracy is</font>

775
00:51:11,609 --> 00:51:16,049
exhausting and it takes a lot of time

776
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:21,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's one part of the answer of course</font>

777
00:51:16,050 --> 00:51:24,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">and the other is we've realized after 23</font>

778
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:27,090
years that<font color="#E5E5E5"> yes actually you know we can</font>

779
00:51:24,810 --> 00:51:29,880
extend data protection

780
00:51:27,090 --> 00:51:32,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">I don't know where you were</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 23 years ago</font>

781
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:35,970
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet used to be a lot slower</font>

782
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:38,820
back then<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I do think it's actually</font>

783
00:51:35,970 --> 00:51:43,680
kind of nice that now we've decided to

784
00:51:38,820 --> 00:51:48,090
strengthen our data protection and also

785
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:49,799
our main data protector and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I've</font>

786
00:51:48,090 --> 00:51:52,620
said his competence is basically

787
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:57,240
recommendations and giving him the right

788
00:51:52,620 --> 00:51:59,310
to actually punish people<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font>

789
00:51:57,240 --> 00:52:07,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> data protection</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> needs to have</font>

790
00:51:59,310 --> 00:52:11,100
a real bite<font color="#E5E5E5"> so a note here we have we've</font>

791
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:14,910
heard some complaints about<font color="#E5E5E5"> voting and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

792
00:52:11,100 --> 00:52:18,420
do research on this topic<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah</font>

793
00:52:14,910 --> 00:52:21,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">they're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> definitely</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a few problems and i</font>

794
00:52:18,420 --> 00:52:24,750
can personally find out which code which

795
00:52:21,450 --> 00:52:27,480
program was installed there and that it

796
00:52:24,750 --> 00:52:29,100
really only does what<font color="#CCCCCC"> i want but there</font>

797
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:30,960
are few things that actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> problems</font>

798
00:52:29,100 --> 00:52:34,770
that have been solved

799
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:37,140
so for example the end-to-end encryption

800
