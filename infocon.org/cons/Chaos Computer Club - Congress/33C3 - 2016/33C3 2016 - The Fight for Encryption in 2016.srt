148
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:46,349
the big thing that happened last year<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

149
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:51,839
very big public showdown between Apple

that smartphones are are an incredible

154
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:03,149
window into people's lives and they

155
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:04,319
wanted access to that<font color="#CCCCCC"> when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they want to</font>

156
00:07:03,149 --> 00:07:06,749
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at and see what people have been</font>

157
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:08,610
doing and they were trying to do this

158
00:07:06,749 --> 00:07:12,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">through through the courts with court</font>

159
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:15,599
orders and there were two key cases that

160
00:07:12,689 --> 00:07:18,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">help help frame this debate one was a</font>

161
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:21,870
case and<font color="#CCCCCC"> brooklyn new york outside of a</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">California</font>

165
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:34,120
and the first case the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Brooklyn case was</font>

166
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:36,640
a relatively routine case it was trying

00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:39,820
to get onto the phone<font color="#E5E5E5"> of an alleged meth</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">wanted a little bit more and they</font>

174
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:56,979
submitted a application for in order to

175
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:59,590
get Apple to help them<font color="#E5E5E5"> onto the phone</font>

179
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:13,750
unusual for the FBI to go to the court

180
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:16,480
to ask for this access a little bit

181
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:19,930
unusual to ask for a<font color="#CCCCCC"> third-party</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

asked for more briefing<font color="#E5E5E5"> oftentimes these</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">arguments made by the government</font>

00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:34,480
else weighing in

189
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:35,740
but in this case the<font color="#CCCCCC"> court was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like well</font>

00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:39,310
I don't know I don't know this this

196
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:55,120
didn't believe that the all writs<font color="#CCCCCC"> Act</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">that are necessary</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or appropriate</font>

205
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:19,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically to allow the court to do its</font>

206
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:22,570
job so if the court had power to do

207

something<font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can issue a writ in</font>

00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:28,510
was written obviously wasn't thinking

210
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:30,760
about things like smartphones<font color="#E5E5E5"> wasn't</font>

211
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:34,330
really thinking anything along these

212
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:36,160
lines<font color="#CCCCCC"> it was just a basic tool and</font>

213
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:37,020
pretty much<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's the fallback position</font>

214
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:39,420
if you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> no</font>

215
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:41,160
thing else<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can always go to the all</font>

00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:48,959
fly<font color="#CCCCCC"> so while that was pending a new case</font>

killing scores of people before before

229
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:24,630
really made a lot of news<font color="#CCCCCC"> uh several</font>

months after the attacks<font color="#E5E5E5"> they decided</font>

in a car<font color="#E5E5E5"> a black</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Lexus so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the case was</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">the application to the court and that</font>

241
00:10:56,340 --> 00:11:00,810
very same day the court turned around

242
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:03,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">and issued the order to apple me in the</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was a fairly lengthy order</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so this</font>

this may suggest that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm not a whole</font>

249
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:22,319
lot of deep thought went into whether

250
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:25,140
this was possible<font color="#E5E5E5"> and under that</font>

00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:28,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">government requested order they wanted</font>

252
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:31,080
to bypass the auto race function where

253
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:32,880
after a certain number of failed

erase itself<font color="#CCCCCC"> they wanted</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be able to</font>

259
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:48,120
basically they were asking for

260
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:50,460
was to remove the features that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're</font>

294
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:24,630
was a little bit unclear because it was

really that dangerous<font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we shouldn't</font>

297
00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:30,540
thought that was a reason to get in the

00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:36,360

00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:38,010
saying that this was just about trying

00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:41,310
to get into one phone

302
00:13:38,010 --> 00:13:43,680
it wasn't about setting a precedent<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

303
00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:46,079
later under questioning before the US

304
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:47,640
Congress<font color="#CCCCCC"> he admitted that it was about</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">precedent and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they wanted to set this</font>

307
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:55,410
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then he asked the question if there</font>

00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:57,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">are warrant proof spaces</font>

309
00:13:55,410 --> 00:13:57,870
what does that mean and<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the cost</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">of that</font>

311
00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:05,130
and this is a reminder of the time when

312
00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:07,680
we had for 67 years the<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> credible</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lock</font>

313
00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:12,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">we may</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have had</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> worn proof spaces before</font>

314
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:14,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">and we may have them again and it also</font>

315
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:16,050
is not recognizing that there's

316
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:18,599
something fundamentally different about

317
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:20,670
access to<font color="#E5E5E5"> smartphones</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> because of how</font>

318
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:22,890
much of your lives are part of the phone

319
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:25,860
or on the phone<font color="#E5E5E5"> if somebody has access</font>

320
00:14:22,890 --> 00:14:27,029
to that they have a more than just a

321
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:30,000
little bit of evidence they have a

322
00:14:27,029 --> 00:14:32,339
window into your soul and protecting

323
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,040
that is more important than ever

324
00:14:32,339 --> 00:14:37,680
so this became<font color="#CCCCCC"> a major controversy</font>

325
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:39,270
became international news<font color="#E5E5E5"> they had a</font>

00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:44,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">poll that went out during this time</font>

327
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:46,529
period and it was about<font color="#CCCCCC"> 50-50 on whether</font>

328
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:49,890
Apple should provide access or whether

329
00:14:46,529 --> 00:14:51,750
they should deny access which may not

330
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:53,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">you know semi-okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people were divided</font>

331
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:56,670
but what sort of a particularly

332
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:58,170
impressive about that is that when

333
00:14:56,670 --> 00:14:59,640
they're doing a case<font color="#CCCCCC"> where the same we</font>

334
00:14:58,170 --> 00:15:01,770
need to get this information for a

pressures associated with a national

national security<font color="#E5E5E5"> and still they weren't</font>

340
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:18,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">i think this was a lot less support then</font>

341
00:15:16,709 --> 00:15:22,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">then the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> government was expecting when</font>

342
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:25,080
they brought this case and both civil

345
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:31,290
understanding this would be a precedent

that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it would be not just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> president</font>

has security weaknesses in it<font color="#E5E5E5"> so this</font>

351
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:47,069
was coming forward coming to a head with

00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:48,959
a hearing scheduled in<font color="#CCCCCC"> march of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 2016 and</font>

00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:51,060
then we heard from the from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Brooklyn</font>

judge now this this briefing had been

things you know judges will take time to

carefully consider it<font color="#CCCCCC"> might take a while</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">but not very long after the the news</font>

came out the day before the hearing<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

of time to check this out

can we get a delay in the in the hearing

<font color="#CCCCCC">this came out the day before the hearing</font>

375
00:16:44,530 --> 00:16:47,680
actually a lot of people who<font color="#CCCCCC"> I know</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">we're going to go down there had already</font>

00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:55,090
actually just about to head off to the

00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:57,910
airport myself when the news came in and

380
00:16:55,090 --> 00:16:59,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">I was able to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> save myself the trip down</font>

there<font color="#E5E5E5"> but this was sort of very</font>

surprising<font color="#CCCCCC"> last-minute</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> development and</font>

383
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:08,530
then a week later the FBI reported that

384
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:12,880
yes they had gotten access to the phone

385
00:17:08,530 --> 00:17:14,230
and the hearing was cancelled and we got

386
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:17,320
a little bit a little bit of details

387
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:22,329
about this that it was an exploit that

388
00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:24,490
cost well over a million dollars and

389
00:17:22,329 --> 00:17:27,909
<font color="#CCCCCC">then this is those calculated because</font>

390
00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:30,520
the director<font color="#CCCCCC"> kome</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> said that it was more</font>

391
00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:32,170
than his entire salary for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 years</font>

392
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:34,450
that he is going to be FBI director so

393
00:17:32,170 --> 00:17:37,570
people did a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little math and figured out</font>

394
00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:39,790
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> would be over a million dollars and</font>

395
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:44,020
this was a hack that apparently works on

396
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:45,940
the iphone 5c and older devices<font color="#CCCCCC"> a key</font>

00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:49,090

401
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:57,760
something that was defeated by the

404
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:10,270
after the exploit worked<font color="#CCCCCC"> and there was</font>

why you want to have encryption widely

available when you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> is so that if</font>

challenges there are dealing with things

1094
00:49:23,349 --> 00:49:28,779
like that using encryption might be seen

1095
00:49:25,750 --> 00:49:30,520
as a red flag that you know if you get

1096
00:49:28,779 --> 00:49:32,200
stopped by the police they're going to

1097
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:36,640
want to get onto your phone

1098
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:37,750
they may use strong measures to try<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

1105
00:49:45,970 --> 00:49:51,279
challenging things but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think that the</font>

1106
00:49:48,549 --> 00:49:53,920
best thing that you can do ahead of time

1107
00:49:51,279 --> 00:49:57,039
is make it so that everybody is using

1108
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:58,690
encryption as much as possible so that

1109
00:49:57,039 --> 00:50:01,210
it becomes less suspicious that someone

1110
00:49:58,690 --> 00:50:02,589
is using it and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then be tied into widely</font>

1111
00:50:01,210 --> 00:50:05,410
use products that they would feel bad

1112
00:50:02,589 --> 00:50:06,700
about blocking so that's why it's nice

1113
00:50:05,410 --> 00:50:10,940
that there's encryption and things like

1114
00:50:06,700 --> 00:50:13,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">facebook Messenger and whatsapp and then</font>

be able to compel the provider to change

1138

its code and calling it about whether

1139
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:14,270
something is warrant proof is a

1140
00:51:12,050 --> 00:51:16,790
rhetorical device that the government is

1141
00:51:14,270 --> 00:51:18,680
using to try and<font color="#E5E5E5"> have set it up as a</font>

discussion about the rule of law or

whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> war should be effective but it's</font>

1144
00:51:21,290 --> 00:51:25,970
missing the larger policy issues and so

<font color="#CCCCCC">i guess in some sense when they talk</font>

about something is being warrant proof

1147
00:51:27,410 --> 00:51:31,910
that may be a side effect what happens

1148
00:51:29,329 --> 00:51:33,440
when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have strong encryption but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

1149
00:51:31,910 --> 00:51:39,170

rhetoric<font color="#CCCCCC"> it seems like in the past year</font>

00:51:41,450 --> 00:51:45,200
or so<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more about two years we've</font>

1153
00:51:43,819 --> 00:51:47,599
heard a lot about strong encryption

00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:49,368
<font color="#E5E5E5">versus weak encryption and it seems like</font>

1155
00:51:47,599 --> 00:51:51,920
it's going to be more and more a tool

1156
00:51:49,369 --> 00:51:53,750
used by those in power to tell us

1157

well the bad guys<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're the only</font>

people who need strong encryption<font color="#CCCCCC"> use</font>

00:51:55,730 --> 00:51:59,390
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> common folk the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> good people</font>

1160
00:51:57,410 --> 00:52:00,529
you only need<font color="#CCCCCC"> the normal encryption what</font>

1161
00:51:59,390 --> 00:52:02,089
would you go for the bad one

1162
00:52:00,530 --> 00:52:03,650
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think you've touched on that on</font>

1163
00:52:02,089 --> 00:52:05,930
that subject but maybe you<font color="#E5E5E5"> could tell us</font>

1164
00:52:03,650 --> 00:52:07,970
a bit more about it<font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean i think I'm</font>

1165
00:52:05,930 --> 00:52:09,649
strong encryption is really what we need

1166
00:52:07,970 --> 00:52:11,779
and we've seen actually the the terrible

1167
00:52:09,650 --> 00:52:13,940
effects of this<font color="#E5E5E5"> when there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

1168
00:52:11,780 --> 00:52:16,040
misguided attempt to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> weak and</font>

1169
00:52:13,940 --> 00:52:18,770
strong encryption in the nineties where

1170
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:20,839
there was<font color="#E5E5E5"> export grade encryption and</font>

1171
00:52:18,770 --> 00:52:23,599
domestic grade encryption<font color="#E5E5E5"> out of the</font>

00:52:20,839 --> 00:52:27,619
<font color="#CCCCCC">United States</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> netscape navigator</font>

1173
00:52:23,599 --> 00:52:33,650

1175
00:52:33,650 --> 00:52:39,500
and then that turned out to be sort of

1176
00:52:37,099 --> 00:52:42,230
an unwise policy move<font color="#CCCCCC"> they said well</font>

1177
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:43,970
this will be good enough for the average

<font color="#E5E5E5">person and I think there's a couple of</font>

1181
00:52:47,569 --> 00:52:51,890

be a computer criminal<font color="#E5E5E5"> but the value of</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">hello so we've seen that governments try</font>

1195
00:53:21,980 --> 00:53:25,880
again and again to pass legislation that

1196

<font color="#E5E5E5">weekend encryption</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would need to</font>

1198
00:53:29,329 --> 00:53:34,430
such legislation again and again and are

we moving to that<font color="#CCCCCC"> Turks well I think</font>

there's there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not much is going to</font>

1205
00:53:44,750 --> 00:53:52,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">but i think the the key is to try and</font>

into a similar vein like this one

00:55:15,950 --> 00:55:21,859
what could we do to stop or politicians

from wrong

not prevent attacks like this

1245
00:55:32,450 --> 00:55:36,169
what can we do on a political level to

1246
00:55:34,250 --> 00:55:38,810
stop<font color="#CCCCCC"> or politicians from trying to enact</font>

the problem

1249
00:55:39,830 --> 00:55:45,140
yeah this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> there is a very common</font>

00:55:45,140 --> 00:55:49,580
around the world especially something

1252
00:55:47,060 --> 00:55:52,070
like a terrorist attack<font color="#CCCCCC"> legislators feel</font>

1253
00:55:49,580 --> 00:55:57,110
a very strong desire to do something

1254
00:55:52,070 --> 00:56:03,710
about it and and that something may not

1255

1259
00:56:10,520 --> 00:56:15,800
that is educating the the voters so they

are<font color="#CCCCCC"> lists</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fooled by this behavior and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

get people<font color="#E5E5E5"> active</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and calling their</font>

1262
00:56:17,450 --> 00:56:24,560
representatives and telling them that

they want to have strong encryption<font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">the other thing that can sometimes be</font>

1266
00:56:28,610 --> 00:56:34,280
effective as legislators don't like to

look stupid<font color="#CCCCCC"> and so if they are doing</font>

00:56:34,280 --> 00:56:39,680
something which is a technologically bad

show how it is ineffective<font color="#E5E5E5"> that can</font>

1271
00:56:42,920 --> 00:56:46,660
sometimes help<font color="#CCCCCC"> much as you understand</font>

1272
00:56:45,320 --> 00:56:53,710
that it was sort of a

1273
00:56:46,660 --> 00:56:58,839
bad move<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm how this argument is often</font>

1274
00:56:53,710 --> 00:57:01,330
portrayed as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I between citizens and</font>

1275
00:56:58,840 --> 00:57:03,160

1276
00:57:01,330 --> 00:57:07,390
another argument and that's what you

1277
00:57:03,160 --> 00:57:09,009
think about which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> there and foreign</font>

1278
00:57:07,390 --> 00:57:13,420
nation states<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually a far bigger</font>

1279
00:57:09,010 --> 00:57:16,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">three it then crime and therefore states</font>

1280
00:57:13,420 --> 00:57:18,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">need into</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> an encryption more than anyone</font>

00:57:16,870 --> 00:57:20,710
else and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that therefore they should get</font>

1282
00:57:18,700 --> 00:57:24,430
on the side of being<font color="#CCCCCC"> pro encryption</font>

1283
00:57:20,710 --> 00:57:26,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">because they needed to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I absolutely i</font>

1284
00:57:24,430 --> 00:57:28,660
think that something so sometimes that

00:57:26,980 --> 00:57:31,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">is actually an argument can work with</font>

legislators<font color="#E5E5E5"> where they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they're they're</font>

1287

not so worried about the citizens

00:57:34,540 --> 00:57:38,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">directly but they're interested in the</font>

balance of power between<font color="#CCCCCC"> nation states</font>

1290
00:57:38,230 --> 00:57:43,120
and this has come up in in some of the

00:57:40,690 --> 00:57:45,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">backdoor discussions where you know if</font>

you provide a<font color="#CCCCCC"> back door to one</font>

use this power wisely

1296
00:57:50,410 --> 00:57:54,640
