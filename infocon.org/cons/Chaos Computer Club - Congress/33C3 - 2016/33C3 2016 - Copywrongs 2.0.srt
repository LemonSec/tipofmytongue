00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:05,000
meaningful copyright reform in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Europe</font>

about a year

00:01:06,410 --> 00:01:10,460
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Parliament actually proposed some</font>

20
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:13,520
improvements to copyright law based on

21
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:15,919
my initiatives and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> nothing really</font>

22
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:18,289
happened for about a year until

31
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:44,869
me rant about it for the next hour so

32
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:45,740
that gives you an idea of<font color="#E5E5E5"> about how bad</font>

33
00:01:44,869 --> 00:01:47,119
it was

34
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:49,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">and the other thing that happened during</font>

35
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:52,729
that week was that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> European Court of</font>

36
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:55,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">Justice</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> made a ruling</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> where decided that</font>

37
00:01:52,729 --> 00:01:56,179
hyperlinks can constitute a copyright

38
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:58,369
infringement

39
00:01:56,180 --> 00:02:01,159
so you would think that a person<font color="#E5E5E5"> who is</font>

40
00:01:58,369 --> 00:02:03,409
linking<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not the one who is actually</font>

41
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:04,640
putting the stuff online<font color="#CCCCCC"> so they</font>

42
00:02:03,409 --> 00:02:06,020
shouldn't be liable for copyright

43
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,640
infringement

44
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:09,049
however the European Court of Justice

45
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:11,360
asked itself

46
00:02:09,049 --> 00:02:13,370
well what if the person who is linking

47
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,900
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> that content actually knows that</font>

48
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:17,750
content<font color="#E5E5E5"> is illegal</font>

49
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:20,209
they think in this case there should be

50
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:22,430
a copyright infringement so they decided

51
00:02:20,209 --> 00:02:24,680
that this is the case now and then they

52
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:26,720
decided that if this link is made with a

53
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:28,579
profit motive<font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody's trying to make</font>

54
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:30,769
money<font color="#E5E5E5"> then you can pretty much assume</font>

55
00:02:28,579 --> 00:02:32,600
that they know that whatever this<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

56
00:02:30,769 --> 00:02:34,310
are linking<font color="#E5E5E5"> to is a copyright</font>

57
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:36,260
infringement and they actually have to

58
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:38,810
prove that they didn't know which is

59
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:40,880
quite a difficult thing to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> so in this</font>

60
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:44,030
particular case it was about a

61
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:46,489
right-wing<font color="#E5E5E5"> populist website that was for</font>

62
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:48,769
profit that was linking<font color="#E5E5E5"> two unreleased</font>

63
00:02:46,489 --> 00:02:51,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">playboy photos so you might think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

64
00:02:48,769 --> 00:02:54,350
maybe<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't feel too bad for them</font>

65
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:56,890
specifically but what does it actually

66
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:58,660
mean for other websites and

67
00:02:56,890 --> 00:03:00,730
they now have to monitor continuously

68
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:03,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">everything that's going on on the</font>

69
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:06,429
website that they have said<font color="#CCCCCC"> name to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

70
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:08,709
find out<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can look at one ruling that</font>

71
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:10,990
already took place based on that<font color="#CCCCCC"> by</font>

72
00:03:08,709 --> 00:03:16,750
everybody's<font color="#E5E5E5"> favorite court the district</font>

00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:19,120

74
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:21,310
some fans of the district<font color="#CCCCCC"> or fabric in</font>

75
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:23,709
the audience<font color="#E5E5E5"> so the district court of</font>

76
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:26,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">amber</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> had a case where somebody had</font>

77
00:03:23,709 --> 00:03:28,959
linked from their own website from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

78
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:31,450
about me page<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a different website on</font>

79
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:33,130
which there was a photograph that looked

80
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:36,640
a little bit like this it's not exactly

81
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:40,600
this picture actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> with some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> us UFOs</font>

82
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:42,518
<font color="#E5E5E5">and this photo had been modified the</font>

83
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:45,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">fatigue photographer of the original</font>

84
00:03:42,519 --> 00:03:48,310
picture without<font color="#CCCCCC"> ufos</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> had put the photo</font>

85
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:49,989
under a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Creative Commons license and the</font>

86
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:52,150
person who put it on<font color="#E5E5E5"> their website</font>

87
00:03:49,989 --> 00:03:53,200
actually attributed it to the correct

88
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:55,030
photographer

89
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,829
however they did not mention that the

90
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:59,769
original picture actually didn't contain

91
00:03:56,830 --> 00:04:00,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">UFOs</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> therefore it was a copyright</font>

92
00:03:59,769 --> 00:04:03,549
infringement

93
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:05,500
so the court decided that since the

94
00:04:03,549 --> 00:04:09,070
website owner of the website will link

95
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:11,200
to this<font color="#E5E5E5"> sells educational materials on</font>

96
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:14,170
the same domain not on the about me page

97
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:16,478
and not related to this particular link

98
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:18,488
<font color="#E5E5E5">they have a profit motive for that link</font>

99
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:20,560
which is quite a stretch

100
00:04:18,488 --> 00:04:22,599
so the defendant in this case the person

101
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:25,150
with the about me page had an obligation

102
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:26,800
to actually verify that everything on

103
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:29,770
the website there were linking<font color="#CCCCCC"> to is</font>

in practice and actually wrote to the

00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:35,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">court asking hey</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> write about</font>

108
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:39,729
the website of the district court

109
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:42,010
remember can you please verify to me

110
00:04:39,729 --> 00:04:44,289
that everything on your website is legal

111
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:50,840
for some reason the court didn't want to

112
00:04:44,289 --> 00:04:54,080
do that

113
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:56,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">so if you have a website yourself you</font>

00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:05,810
who was wondering whether their website

144
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:08,300
is violating copyright law at this point

145
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:11,660
chances are if the website is in any way

146
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:15,500
commercial then the answer is yes but

147
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:17,330
not everything about 2016 was bad

148
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:26,700

00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:23,620
examples at least for now if you want to

287
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:27,760
train your artificial intelligence with

them in some fort and the new proposal

292
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,980
may also cause problems with that

293

that is already illegal that makes no

almost none of the many many things that

well there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are two proposals in this new</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">as presented that caused all these</font>

331
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:20,829
problems one is an attack on the

333
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:25,300
linking and copyright that we already

334
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:29,110
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the other one is an attack on</font>

00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:33,579
the legally sound hosting of files on

337
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:39,100
comes in the form of a new<font color="#E5E5E5"> extra layer</font>

338
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,720
of copyright protection for the benefit

of publishers<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is the so-called</font>

341
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:48,970
of the copyright that journalists

right at the moment but this is an extra

00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:05,389
layer of protection that would apply in

349
00:15:04,009 --> 00:15:08,360

352
00:15:11,389 --> 00:15:17,120

similar introduced in Germany a few

years ago where the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the amount of</font>

consider well actually use articles<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font>

not that valuable after a while but they

actually apply retroactively<font color="#CCCCCC"> Lee so that</font>

00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:42,450
really creates a problem for hyperlinks

<font color="#E5E5E5">publishers keep saying that individuals</font>

unlike what<font color="#CCCCCC"> hurting our says here it</font>

455

probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> won't matter at all whether</font>

456
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:34,740
it's a purely factual headline or not

457
00:19:32,610 --> 00:19:37,320
because these neighboring rights to

458
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:39,510
copyright don't have a requirement that

459
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:41,760
the thing they protect is an original

460
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:45,000
intellectual creation<font color="#E5E5E5"> because the</font>

461
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:48,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">publishers aren't originally creating</font>

anything in the first place<font color="#CCCCCC"> so the only</font>

463
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:52,710
way that somehow factual headlines could

464
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:55,020
be exempted is if the court decides<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

465
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:56,850
can't actually tell whether it was taken

466
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:58,139
from this newspaper article or from

467
00:19:56,850 --> 00:20:02,159
another one

468
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:05,010
so what what is up with this indexing

469
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:07,140
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think this is probably a really</font>

470
00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:10,020
big problem with this law that not

471
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:13,680
everybody has<font color="#E5E5E5"> a fully considered because</font>

472
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:16,440
the indexing of course of websites

473
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:19,560
creates copies and you may think well if

474
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:21,090
somebody takes<font color="#E5E5E5"> a full copy of a article</font>

475
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:24,120
isn't that a copyright infringement

476
00:20:21,090 --> 00:20:26,580
already<font color="#CCCCCC"> it would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be but so far this is</font>

485
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:48,240

489
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:56,879
however as soon as the search engines

490
00:20:55,350 --> 00:21:00,240
are no longer allowed to show the

headache and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm not sure they have</font>

under this definition they will have to

00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:20,980
choose between two alternative

00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:22,990
obligations

523
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:25,270
either they get a license from the

rights holders<font color="#CCCCCC"> probably from collecting</font>

527
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:34,660
sure that those licenses are enforced

528
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:36,520
and helpfully in the recitals that go

<font color="#CCCCCC">suggest that they could enforce them by</font>

using content monitoring technologies<font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font>

they don't want to do that then they

533
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:49,149
have to prevent the availability of

534
00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:51,159
copyrighted works identified by the

535
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:53,770
rights holders for example by using

536
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:58,090
content monitoring technologies<font color="#CCCCCC"> so those</font>

537
00:22:53,770 --> 00:23:00,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">are the two options</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if you're familiar</font>

00:22:58,090 --> 00:23:02,770
with internet law a little bit the way

539
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:05,950
it works at the moment is if you run the

and the preventing availability that is

550
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:35,350
that the content needs to be controlled

and scanned before the upload actually

don't take our licensing agreement where

00:25:00,490 --> 00:25:03,430
we pay you very little

586
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:04,810
then we'll just take down all the

want to be on<font color="#CCCCCC"> youtube</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they're in a</font>

00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:11,679
very weak bargaining position and they

590
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:14,290
think that this law will somehow make it

591
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:17,680
so unattractive for<font color="#E5E5E5"> YouTube</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to take</font>

more money

594
00:25:18,490 --> 00:25:22,510
it's a bit of a gamble and it's also not

595
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:24,580
a very obvious way of addressing this

596
00:25:22,510 --> 00:25:27,430
problem because unfortunately you can't

597
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:30,260
pass a law that only applies to<font color="#CCCCCC"> youtube</font>

599
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:36,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">so this law would of course apply to all</font>

the question of why get<font color="#CCCCCC"> help now falls</font>

but you can pay to get some extra

difficult position under this new law

have a good chance of simply getting

00:41:06,150 --> 00:41:10,620
them on the phone and the debate about

1011

beat these proposals and can hopefully

1012
00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:01,590
go back to the urgent task of actually

1013

making copyright law<font color="#E5E5E5"> easier and safer</font>

committed a copyright infringement and

1037
00:43:14,820 --> 00:43:18,720
this is what this new question of

1038
00:43:17,370 --> 00:43:20,970
whether linking is a copyright

1039
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:23,700
infringement or not is about<font color="#E5E5E5"> but you can</font>

1040
00:43:20,970 --> 00:43:26,549
also have an accessory liability<font color="#E5E5E5"> where</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> court can prove that you aided and</font>

1042
00:43:26,550 --> 00:43:30,540
abetted the copyright infringement of

1043
00:43:28,290 --> 00:43:33,300
somebody else<font color="#CCCCCC"> so even if technically</font>

1044
00:43:30,540 --> 00:43:35,040
this link would not be a copyright

1045
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:37,380
infringement it's still possible that

1046

you as the person running the<font color="#E5E5E5"> website</font>

1047
00:43:37,380 --> 00:43:48,930
would be liable for it so and<font color="#E5E5E5"> next</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">please microphone</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> three</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and yeah I am a</font>

1050

education and there will be no exception

1051
00:43:53,340 --> 00:43:56,670
for education so<font color="#CCCCCC"> was to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> difficult for</font>

1052
00:43:55,350 --> 00:43:59,009
teachers and everyone to share this

1053
00:43:56,670 --> 00:44:00,150
material and and the question my

1054
00:43:59,010 --> 00:44:01,790
question<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be whether this is also</font>

1055
00:44:00,150 --> 00:44:04,670
discussed within

00:44:01,790 --> 00:44:06,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">within their a revision project and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah</font>

1057
00:44:04,670 --> 00:44:09,950
maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> give some insight on that</font>

1058
00:44:06,050 --> 00:44:12,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">there is one exception that applies to</font>

1059
00:44:09,950 --> 00:44:14,750
education that is in the proposal<font color="#CCCCCC"> i have</font>

1060
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:16,910
not mentioned it because it's not really

1061
00:44:14,750 --> 00:44:19,460
clearly good or bad

1062
00:44:16,910 --> 00:44:21,620
what this proposal does is it says that

1063
00:44:19,460 --> 00:44:27,560
it will be mandatory for every member

1064
00:44:21,620 --> 00:44:30,950
state in the EU to allow the use of<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1065
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:33,140
different copyrighted content for

1066
00:44:30,950 --> 00:44:36,529
digital teaching activities so for

1067
00:44:33,140 --> 00:44:39,290
example if you are using some kind of

1068
00:44:36,530 --> 00:44:41,630
online service for<font color="#E5E5E5"> for students to</font>

1069
00:44:39,290 --> 00:44:43,490
download<font color="#E5E5E5"> texts or if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you're live</font>

1070
00:44:41,630 --> 00:44:45,950
streaming your lectures to students in

1071
00:44:43,490 --> 00:44:48,169
other countries<font color="#CCCCCC"> however</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there are two</font>

1072
00:44:45,950 --> 00:44:49,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">cabinets with this one is that the</font>

1073
00:44:48,170 --> 00:44:52,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">member states can decide for themselves</font>

1074
00:44:49,850 --> 00:44:54,650
whether or not there is a compensation

1075
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:57,410
for this and for example in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Germany</font>

1076
00:44:54,650 --> 00:44:59,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">there is an exception for education</font>

1077
00:44:57,410 --> 00:45:06,200
however it hasn't really worked recently

1078
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:07,939
because the compensation<font color="#E5E5E5"> the the quarter</font>

1079
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:09,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">they're collecting society that is</font>

1080
00:45:07,940 --> 00:45:13,580
responsible for collecting the

1081
00:45:09,980 --> 00:45:16,970
compensation this<font color="#CCCCCC"> guy's waving at you</font>

1082
00:45:13,580 --> 00:45:18,890
the the money that the collecting

1083
00:45:16,970 --> 00:45:20,720
societies collecting they have gained a

1084
00:45:18,890 --> 00:45:23,359
court ruling that said that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they were</font>

1085
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:26,899
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> university's actually have to tell</font>

1086
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:29,060
them who exactly<font color="#CCCCCC"> half hour how many</font>

1087
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:30,980
times<font color="#CCCCCC"> a particular work has been used</font>

1088
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:33,620
and so on so the bureaucratic effort is

1089
00:45:30,980 --> 00:45:35,390
so large that because the compensation

1090
00:45:33,620 --> 00:45:37,130
requirement it hasn't really worked very

1091
00:45:35,390 --> 00:45:38,960
well that's one problem

1092
00:45:37,130 --> 00:45:42,530
the other problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that this proposal</font>

1093
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:45,320
also says that if there are appropriate

1094
00:45:42,530 --> 00:45:47,090
licenses available on the market then

1095
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:49,370
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> member state can decide that the</font>

1096
00:45:47,090 --> 00:45:50,990
exception doesn't apply<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is also</font>

1097
00:45:49,370 --> 00:45:53,630
something that we know from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> German</font>

1098
00:45:50,990 --> 00:45:55,729
context that a publisher may say that

1099
00:45:53,630 --> 00:45:58,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">there's an appropriate</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> license available</font>

1100
00:45:55,730 --> 00:46:03,140
but it actually is not really usable for

1101
00:45:58,460 --> 00:46:05,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">institutions so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there's definitely an</font>

1102
00:46:03,140 --> 00:46:08,240
attempt from different educational

1103
00:46:05,870 --> 00:46:09,950
organizations to improve this exception

1104
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:12,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think the most important thing</font>

1105
00:46:09,950 --> 00:46:13,710
would be to to address these two parts

1106
00:46:12,470 --> 00:46:15,689
and make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1107
00:46:13,710 --> 00:46:18,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">at this exception would actually apply</font>

1108
00:46:15,690 --> 00:46:20,940
in practice<font color="#E5E5E5"> but in any case it would not</font>

1109
00:46:18,060 --> 00:46:22,830
be the same as a general education

1110
00:46:20,940 --> 00:46:24,900
exception that applies also to what is

1111
00:46:22,830 --> 00:46:26,190
happening inside the classroom or what

1112
00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:29,369
is happening in non-formal education

1113
00:46:26,190 --> 00:46:30,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really only for digital users</font>

1114
00:46:29,369 --> 00:46:33,030
because the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Commission says this is</font>

1115
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:34,800
where<font color="#CCCCCC"> there is a cross-border problem so</font>

1116
00:46:33,030 --> 00:46:36,240
there's definitely a lot of room for

1117
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:40,530
improvement when it comes to this

1118

<font color="#E5E5E5">the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> European Commission actually did a</font>

people wrote to them and told them what

1138

they think about this question of a

things that this kind of copyright law

1153
00:48:10,140 --> 00:48:15,060
is a good idea and probably not even

these these different voices and see

1158
00:48:21,270 --> 00:48:27,210
that not everybody agrees with this

1159
00:48:23,430 --> 00:48:29,160

from the signal angel please

<font color="#E5E5E5">very complicated question so copyright</font>

1166
00:48:43,890 --> 00:48:50,940
law is territorial which means that the

copyright law applies<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the country in</font>

which the copyright relevant<font color="#CCCCCC"> act is</font>

something available on the internet it's

1175
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:10,200
a lot more complicated and it's not

1176
00:49:08,190 --> 00:49:13,380
actually fully decided whether it's the

the country where the website is legally

established or it could even be the

country where the user is located<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

1181
00:49:20,850 --> 00:49:25,710
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is one of the reasons why you see</font>

geo-blocking sometimes because<font color="#CCCCCC"> right</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">that's also one of the reasons why we</font>

different ones because if you want to

actually know for sure that what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

you pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much have to have a doctorate</font>

help to escalate this<font color="#CCCCCC"> situation for</font>

1199
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:05,490
example when we're talking about our

1200
00:50:03,030 --> 00:50:07,290
friends from the court in<font color="#E5E5E5"> handbook and</font>

1201
00:50:05,490 --> 00:50:09,990
we just have to look at their decisions

1202
00:50:07,290 --> 00:50:12,990
and what they<font color="#E5E5E5"> linked to in their</font>

1203
00:50:09,990 --> 00:50:17,490
decisions and<font color="#E5E5E5"> declared illegal in their</font>

1204
00:50:12,990 --> 00:50:19,410
decisions and to have<font color="#CCCCCC"> um perhaps a means</font>

1205
00:50:17,490 --> 00:50:21,839
to just tell them that they have a link

00:50:19,410 --> 00:50:22,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">linking to an illegal thing and</font>

1207
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:24,780
therefore<font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have to take it down</font>

1208
00:50:22,740 --> 00:50:26,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">there are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> responsible for it and then</font>

1209
00:50:24,780 --> 00:50:27,900
escalated on<font color="#CCCCCC"> a European level</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:34,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">well the the court rulings themselves</font>

1212
00:50:31,860 --> 00:50:39,210
probably don't have links<font color="#E5E5E5"> as such they</font>

1213
00:50:34,980 --> 00:50:41,460
may have strings of text that indicates

the location of your<font color="#CCCCCC"> else but of course</font>

1215
00:50:41,460 --> 00:50:45,000
that's not the same thing as a link<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

1216
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:47,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually quite an interesting</font>

1217
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:49,680
philosophical distinction that if you

1218
00:50:47,070 --> 00:50:50,790
can click on it it's a link<font color="#E5E5E5"> if it's just</font>

00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:52,919
the text then

00:50:50,790 --> 00:50:56,310
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> I suppose it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> modern it's just a</font>

string of<font color="#E5E5E5"> text</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and copy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pasting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a string</font>

1222
00:50:56,310 --> 00:50:59,340
and not having the link directly would

1223
00:50:58,230 --> 00:51:01,230
also be an option

1224
00:50:59,340 --> 00:51:02,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">I don't know I sometimes I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think that</font>

00:51:01,230 --> 00:51:04,230
it's actually the<font color="#CCCCCC"> European Court of</font>

that just<font color="#E5E5E5"> make no sense whatsoever that</font>

will<font color="#E5E5E5"> force us to reform the exclusive</font>

rights that underlie the copyright law

1231
00:51:14,190 --> 00:51:18,330
because if the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Lincoln</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can be a</font>

1232
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:20,430

00:51:18,330 --> 00:51:22,410
therefore a copyright relevant<font color="#E5E5E5"> act</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> well</font>

1234
00:51:20,430 --> 00:51:24,390
then everybody is infringing on

00:51:22,410 --> 00:51:26,190
copyright and maybe we need to change it

1236
00:51:24,390 --> 00:51:28,740
at some point<font color="#CCCCCC"> so I think you might have</font>

what do we do about it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and against it</font>

00:51:56,890 --> 00:52:01,779
idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> because for example there is this</font>

00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:12,310
really revolutionary that would allow

00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:25,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">ideal would be to reject the article 11</font>

1257
00:52:23,320 --> 00:52:28,090
which is this<font color="#CCCCCC"> neighboring</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right for</font>

1258
00:52:25,120 --> 00:52:30,250
publishers and the article 13 which is

1259
00:52:28,090 --> 00:52:32,350
the constant monitoring provision and

1260
00:52:30,250 --> 00:52:34,930
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> recitals</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that are redefining what</font>

1261

<font color="#E5E5E5">host provider is and then try to improve</font>

1262
00:52:34,930 --> 00:52:38,710
the other parts and the way to do this

1263
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:41,620
is of course a little bit more difficult

1264
00:52:38,710 --> 00:52:43,300
than for example with actor or<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

1265
00:52:41,620 --> 00:52:46,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">where you could simply go to the streets</font>

1266
00:52:43,300 --> 00:52:47,950
and say<font color="#E5E5E5"> reject this entire thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font>

1267
00:52:46,300 --> 00:52:50,080
if it stayed the way it is then we

1268
00:52:47,950 --> 00:52:51,220
should reject it then<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's doing more</font>

1269
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:53,529
harm than good

1270
00:52:51,220 --> 00:52:54,970
but we actually have a number of people

1271
00:52:53,530 --> 00:52:59,290
working on it in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> european parliament</font>

1272

who are relatively sensible<font color="#E5E5E5"> the reporter</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">so if you are feeling like a lobbyist</font>

1281
00:53:17,620 --> 00:53:22,330
today you could also try and explain

1282

this to her and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I am I impression of her</font>

1284
00:53:24,280 --> 00:53:27,670
understand how this stuff works

1285
00:53:25,630 --> 00:53:29,650
technologically and tries to find a

1286
00:53:27,670 --> 00:53:31,420
solution that works for everybody<font color="#CCCCCC"> so I</font>

1287
00:53:29,650 --> 00:53:33,700
think what we need to do now is really

1288
00:53:31,420 --> 00:53:35,440
started public debate about these things

1289
00:53:33,700 --> 00:53:37,060
and especially when it comes to the

1290
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:39,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">neighboring right the debate has already</font>

1291
00:53:37,060 --> 00:53:43,210
changed considerably<font color="#CCCCCC"> when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this was being</font>

1292
00:53:39,940 --> 00:53:45,680
discussed in Germany a few years ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1293
00:53:43,210 --> 00:53:47,359
publishers were basically

1294
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:49,220
having a field day all the media were

1295
00:53:47,359 --> 00:53:50,808
writing that this is a great thing

1296
00:53:49,220 --> 00:53:53,029
this is very different today you have a

1297
00:53:50,809 --> 00:53:55,849
lot of especially online journalists who

1298
00:53:53,030 --> 00:53:58,400
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> writing against the best interests</font>

1299

of their publishers as they should<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1300
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:04,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">so you can see that there that there is</font>

1301
00:54:01,460 --> 00:54:06,290
a way of addressing this and making it a

1302
00:54:04,220 --> 00:54:08,000
public issue<font color="#CCCCCC"> and if we do that then I</font>

1303
00:54:06,290 --> 00:54:10,759
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's possible to delete these two</font>

1304
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:12,559
proposals and make sure that the rest<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1305
00:54:10,760 --> 00:54:14,569
the proposal actually gets turned into

1306
00:54:12,559 --> 00:54:16,849
something meaningful and something that

1307
00:54:14,569 --> 00:54:19,279
will make the situation better

been completely static since then

is that you knew about it and you're

what do you think about this well there

1340
00:55:40,280 --> 00:55:44,780
are a lot of archiving<font color="#E5E5E5"> websites like the</font>

00:55:49,130 --> 00:55:54,680
assumption that the people who are the

1345

right soldiers probably don't care about

1346

this anymore nobody is really hurt<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

1348
00:55:59,479 --> 00:56:03,859
no longer commercially on the market and

1349
00:56:02,089 --> 00:56:05,690
so they can rely on this notice and

1350
00:56:03,859 --> 00:56:07,729
takedown mechanism they only have to

1351
00:56:05,690 --> 00:56:08,630
take it down if the<font color="#E5E5E5"> right soldier tells</font>

1355
00:56:12,410 --> 00:56:18,710
this actually works pretty well and for

1356
00:56:15,829 --> 00:56:21,559
them they wouldn't have to take down the

1357

1358

<font color="#E5E5E5">make sure that my stuff is not available</font>

1362
00:56:30,890 --> 00:56:35,269
that would require them to install this

<font color="#E5E5E5">would become a lot larger and probably</font>

1391
00:57:44,599 --> 00:57:49,819
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> at least he's he's kind of willing</font>

1392
00:57:46,369 --> 00:57:53,150
to talk to people and he generally<font color="#E5E5E5"> also</font>

1393
00:57:49,819 --> 00:57:55,729
has more sympathy for smaller companies

1394
00:57:53,150 --> 00:57:58,400
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> start-up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so he probably will want to</font>

1395
00:57:55,729 --> 00:58:01,098
try to create an ecosystem where they

1396
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:03,200
can actually grow<font color="#CCCCCC"> so I think that's good</font>

1397
00:58:01,099 --> 00:58:05,119
however we don't know whether he will be

the digital<font color="#CCCCCC"> commissioner in the long</font>

1419
00:58:53,530 --> 00:58:57,220
block then you're not a host provider

1420
00:58:55,360 --> 00:58:59,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">you're just while you're basically</font>

1421
00:58:57,220 --> 00:59:01,899
running your own website so this new

1422
00:58:59,110 --> 00:59:04,480
provision only applies to host providers

1423
00:59:01,900 --> 00:59:06,520
that provide service<font color="#E5E5E5"> father people so at</font>

1424
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:08,590
least on that front you're fine<font color="#E5E5E5"> i would</font>

1425
00:59:06,520 --> 00:59:11,920
be careful with the linking that you do

1426
00:59:08,590 --> 00:59:15,070
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's probably</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay thanks</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">there was an infringement but nothing</font>

1434

neither the user<font color="#CCCCCC"> nordy hosting website</font>

1436
00:59:35,080 --> 00:59:39,640
would really<font color="#E5E5E5"> risk anything so with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1437
00:59:38,800 --> 00:59:43,540
change

1438
00:59:39,640 --> 00:59:45,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">um maybe the proposal includes a</font>

1439
00:59:43,540 --> 00:59:47,350
provision that says that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> host</font>

1440
00:59:45,700 --> 00:59:50,020
providers need to put in place a

1441
00:59:47,350 --> 00:59:52,150
complaint mechanism that would be

1442
00:59:50,020 --> 00:59:54,220
available both to the rights holders if

1443
00:59:52,150 --> 00:59:57,220
their stuff is actually continuing to

1444
00:59:54,220 --> 00:59:59,379
become available and also for the users

1445
00:59:57,220 --> 01:00:01,450
for example if stuff has been taken down

1446
00:59:59,380 --> 01:00:03,430
there is not an infringement

1447
01:00:01,450 --> 01:00:07,299
unfortunately<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't think this will</font>

1448
01:00:03,430 --> 01:00:09,100
really work for the users because the

1449
01:00:07,300 --> 01:00:11,110
exceptions to copyright law are

1450
01:00:09,100 --> 01:00:13,509
different in every country and they also

1451
01:00:11,110 --> 01:00:15,700
are not considered to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> rights</font>

1452
01:00:13,510 --> 01:00:17,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">themselves so basically platform could</font>

1453
01:00:15,700 --> 01:00:20,379
simply<font color="#E5E5E5"> right into their terms of service</font>

1454
01:00:17,260 --> 01:00:22,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">we only accept licensed content and we</font>

1455
01:00:20,380 --> 01:00:26,290
don't care whether this is legal as

1456
01:00:22,420 --> 01:00:28,480
a parody or whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> so the remedies are</font>

1457
01:00:26,290 --> 01:00:30,880
not really clear it also says that there

1458
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:32,740
has to be some kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> round table</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> where</font>

1459
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:34,540
all the different stakeholders come

1460
01:00:32,740 --> 01:00:36,520
together so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> host</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> providers the</font>

1461
01:00:34,540 --> 01:00:38,349
rights holders and so on<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it really</font>

1462
01:00:36,520 --> 01:00:41,980
shows that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Commission is thinking of</font>

1463
01:00:38,349 --> 01:00:44,559
large companies like<font color="#E5E5E5"> the the big major</font>

1464
01:00:41,980 --> 01:00:45,940
labels but not individual rights holders

1465
01:00:44,559 --> 01:00:50,589
who are most certainly not<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font>

01:00:45,940 --> 01:00:54,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">start</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a roundtable things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so I'm afraid</font>

1467
01:00:50,589 --> 01:00:57,130
that is all the time we had<font color="#E5E5E5"> for Q&A with</font>
