actually already in court officially the

<font color="#CCCCCC">it's bad for you</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">so the best way to deal with this is</font>

00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:38,609
actually this doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not right</font>

00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:42,780
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> does not apply to me</font>

89
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:45,750
so the the easiest way to get out of

90
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:48,479
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> the for users is actually to just</font>

91
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:50,039
pay the money<font color="#E5E5E5"> but that's why a lot of</font>

92
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:52,409
people just pay the money even though

93
00:06:50,039 --> 00:07:00,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">officially they're not entitled to this</font>

94
00:06:52,410 --> 00:07:04,979
money so if you can prove that you're

00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:06,150
not the person<font color="#E5E5E5"> committing this copyright</font>

97
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:10,560
sometimes it's quite easy to get out of

98
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:15,930
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> but sometimes they're quite</font>

99
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:19,050
persistent<font color="#CCCCCC"> so sometimes you will get a</font>

100
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:20,910
better offer<font color="#E5E5E5"> you'll</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all well you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> were</font>

supposed to pay 400 euros but now you

102
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:24,660
only have to pay 200 euros<font color="#CCCCCC"> but some of</font>

103
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:29,070
them are actually sold two more

aggressive<font color="#E5E5E5"> firms that will then do this</font>

105
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:45,300
more aggressively

106
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:50,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">ok so there's three ways to resolve this</font>

107
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:53,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">one way is after three years the term on</font>

108
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:54,030
this is limited and you leave and it

109
00:07:53,220 --> 00:08:01,860
goes away

110
00:07:54,030 --> 00:08:07,039
another way is<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a another way is to</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">sorry</font>

that these claims are based on and then

176
00:12:55,330 --> 00:13:00,580
there's this lovely thing of love the

in a civil procedure

00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:09,580
the question is always<font color="#E5E5E5"> has there been a</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">damaged and if so how much</font>

is to deter others people from doing

there's there's no financial risk for

is that the network is actually getting

they want to make more profits

work

435
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:19,370
anymore because we think the people

436
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:21,800
sending out these<font color="#E5E5E5"> cease-and-desist</font>

437
00:31:19,370 --> 00:31:28,909
letters should actually collect this

438
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:31,010
information by themselves because

439
00:31:28,910 --> 00:31:33,680
usually when you get these kind of

440
00:31:31,010 --> 00:31:36,230
letters from a federal judge<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

442
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:39,530
this is not true<font color="#CCCCCC"> you send it back and</font>

443
00:31:37,850 --> 00:31:42,379
that's fine<font color="#CCCCCC"> and this is the way it</font>

444
00:31:39,530 --> 00:31:45,980
should be here as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> there should be</font>

445
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:49,400
an easy simple way to do that and we

446
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:52,550
hope that the kind of customer

actually be able to push this through
