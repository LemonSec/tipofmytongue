00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:40,580
then you can try to find<font color="#E5E5E5"> arguments for</font>

why this would be interesting to other

broken<font color="#E5E5E5"> all up then it's nice to try to</font>

467
00:22:51,650 --> 00:22:58,970
quickly build a description of this

468

using the<font color="#CCCCCC"> three-sentence</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> role you want</font>

actually solve this was an option that

00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:24,950
we can use in order to solve this

475
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:27,830
problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> and we can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do this in three</font>

482
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:51,740
you can always see it broken down into

<font color="#E5E5E5">these three sentences in particular if</font>

and keep working on that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and maybe then</font>

555
00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:57,899
extend from that later if you have more

668
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:16,510
the last question<font color="#E5E5E5"> someone</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ask about the</font>

669
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:18,160
legal situation about<font color="#E5E5E5"> dongles on devices</font>

670
00:32:16,510 --> 00:32:19,330
how it does that is<font color="#CCCCCC"> not compatible</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

671
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:26,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">property law</font>

672
00:32:19,330 --> 00:32:28,600
good question property law is<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font>

673
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:33,250
not a legal expert but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't think</font>

674
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:35,740
it's a huge obstacle because<font color="#CCCCCC"> the devices</font>

675
00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:38,170
are not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be in giving documents</font>

676
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:40,420
in retrospect<font color="#CCCCCC"> these are devices that are</font>

677
00:32:38,170 --> 00:32:43,480
sold with<font color="#CCCCCC"> Donald so if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i buy a device</font>

678
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:45,700
like this and i know that restriction

679
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:47,020
like this is in force on the device then

680
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:49,240
legally is probably not a problem

681
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:51,520
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> I knew this when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> boarded</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

682
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:52,870
lockdown isn't brought in at a later

683
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:55,300
stage<font color="#E5E5E5"> which doesn't make the whole thing</font>

684
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:56,860
much better<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there's a</font>

685
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:58,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">drop a problem with property law</font>

686
00:32:56,860 --> 00:33:00,310
unfortunately

687
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:01,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay thank you another applause for</font>
