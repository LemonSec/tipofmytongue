85
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:37,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">explanations here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> why you know why</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we so</font>

86
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:38,750
wrong why<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this such a surprise</font>

87
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:40,400
one is that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> polls were just</font>

88
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:42,770
systematically<font color="#E5E5E5"> wrong nate silver at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> five</font>

89
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">thirty eight sam wang</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and many others</font>

90
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:45,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just said you know there was there</font>

91
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">was high uncertainty about how your</font>

92
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:50,180
uncertainty in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> polls than we</font>

93
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:52,010
anticipated and this seems reasonable

94
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:55,310
the other explanation is that the

95
00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:56,840
election was rigged<font color="#CCCCCC"> which is a position</font>

96
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:59,120
that prior to the election was<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

largely a supported by<font color="#CCCCCC"> president-elect</font>

00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:05,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">romp this is probably unlikely but</font>

99
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:08,390
nevertheless<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> reading feasible</font>

100
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,710
how would we even know you know how are

101
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:10,940
we going to determine whether it was

102
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:12,739
just the<font color="#E5E5E5"> polls</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> were wrong</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or whether or</font>

103
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:19,849
not there was actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> written</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so that</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">would Clinton do it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so there were a few</font>

512
00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:11,759
concerns that the campaign brought up

513
00:22:10,049 --> 00:22:14,070
the first one and the most aggravating

514
00:22:11,759 --> 00:22:16,019
to me is they wanted to know what

515
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:17,100
evidence we had that the election had

516
00:22:16,019 --> 00:22:19,019
been hacked

517
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:22,109
wait a minute that seems completely

518
00:22:19,019 --> 00:22:24,570
backwards<font color="#CCCCCC"> the purpose of a recount of</font>

519
00:22:22,109 --> 00:22:26,489
any examination of the paper<font color="#E5E5E5"> ballots is</font>

520
00:22:24,570 --> 00:22:29,908
to gather evidence that the outcome was

521
00:22:26,489 --> 00:22:32,279
correct or not<font color="#E5E5E5"> without looking at them</font>

522
00:22:29,909 --> 00:22:34,019
<font color="#CCCCCC">we don't have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the evidence to begin with</font>

523
00:22:32,279 --> 00:22:36,359
all we can do is say that it would be

524
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:38,190
possible for an attack<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have changed</font>

525
00:22:36,359 --> 00:22:39,090
the result without leaving any visible

00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:41,279
evidence

527
00:22:39,090 --> 00:22:43,499
another concern<font color="#E5E5E5"> was how to pay for the</font>

528
00:22:41,279 --> 00:22:45,809
recounts the cost was likely to rise to

529
00:22:43,499 --> 00:22:48,539
the millions of dollars but maybe most

530
00:22:45,809 --> 00:22:50,730
important<font color="#E5E5E5"> and most aggravating</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was they</font>

531

532
00:22:50,730 --> 00:22:55,799
the concession about tiptoeing away from

535
00:22:59,399 --> 00:23:03,178
particular concern because there was

536
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:07,139
this famous incident during the third

537
00:23:03,179 --> 00:23:09,389
presidential debate where Trump<font color="#E5E5E5"> refused</font>

538
00:23:07,139 --> 00:23:13,379
to say yes he would accept the election

539
00:23:09,389 --> 00:23:15,149
results and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Clinton reacted to this by</font>

540
00:23:13,379 --> 00:23:17,998
saying that something truly horrifying

it's a direct threat to our democracy

542
00:23:17,999 --> 00:23:21,269
well there are two things he could have

543
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:24,269
meant<font color="#E5E5E5"> right one was he wouldn't accept</font>

544
00:23:21,269 --> 00:23:26,249
the result when settled<font color="#E5E5E5"> right that he</font>

545
00:23:24,269 --> 00:23:28,799
wouldn't concede power to the victor

546
00:23:26,249 --> 00:23:30,720
that is truly horrifying<font color="#E5E5E5"> but the other</font>

547
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:32,700
which is kind of a rational thing is

548
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:34,859
well<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to accept the results</font>

549
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:36,419
until all the evidence is examined to

550
00:23:34,859 --> 00:23:39,059
make sure it wasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> rigged</font>

551
00:23:36,419 --> 00:23:41,999
<font color="#E5E5E5">well she was committed to a position</font>

552
00:23:39,059 --> 00:23:44,549
that not<font color="#E5E5E5"> accepting the election results</font>

553
00:23:41,999 --> 00:23:47,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">immediately was a threat to democracy</font>

554
00:23:44,549 --> 00:23:50,730
and so any kind of tiptoeing away from

555
00:23:47,639 --> 00:23:52,619
that would have been a political problem

556
00:23:50,730 --> 00:23:54,059
alright so that was the first

557
00:23:52,619 --> 00:23:56,009
conversation we had a number of

558
00:23:54,059 --> 00:23:57,899
conversations trying to convince the

559
00:23:56,009 --> 00:24:00,869
Clinton people to move ahead with

560
00:23:57,899 --> 00:24:04,678
<font color="#CCCCCC">recounts</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but it didn't seem like we were</font>

561
00:24:00,869 --> 00:24:06,330
ever going to get there<font color="#E5E5E5"> but then we had</font>

562
00:24:04,679 --> 00:24:08,009
a new idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> this time from David</font>

565
00:24:12,239 --> 00:24:17,669

<font color="#E5E5E5">any candidate can request a recount and</font>

what's called a statistical risk lemme

983
00:41:27,750 --> 00:41:33,690
limiting audit<font color="#CCCCCC"> or basically you have got</font>

984
00:41:31,170 --> 00:41:35,309
a very small sample<font color="#E5E5E5"> ballots randomly</font>

987
00:41:36,990 --> 00:41:41,879
it and you can count them and you can

988
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:44,849
show statistically that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> hand counted</font>

990
00:41:44,849 --> 00:41:48,960
this is significantly cheaper than a

00:42:00,690 --> 00:42:03,990
do we do how do we draw conclusions from

this

999
00:42:03,990 --> 00:42:08,669
well we can rule out some attack

scenarios for instance statewide fraud

1001
00:42:08,670 --> 00:42:12,000
you know it's unlikely in a recount that

1002
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:14,038
every single ballot<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it was actor</font>

hacked

1006
00:42:16,890 --> 00:42:21,210
what about other scenarios so we're

00:42:18,869 --> 00:42:22,559

1008
00:42:21,210 --> 00:42:25,140
the idea is that we want to test the

you need more more counties to throw the
