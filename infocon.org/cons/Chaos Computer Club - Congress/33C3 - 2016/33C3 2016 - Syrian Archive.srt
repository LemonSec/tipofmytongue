we have a list of the sources for the

223
00:09:25,029 --> 00:09:29,949

can go into that in a bit

00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:52,379
the third step for verification is to

284
00:11:50,759 --> 00:11:55,410
verify the location so this is the whole

to your location that we can determine

00:11:56,850 --> 00:12:01,230
by reading the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Jude descriptions of the</font>

288

00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:05,430
communicating with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the people who have</font>

290
00:12:02,459 --> 00:12:08,279

more<font color="#E5E5E5"> in depth to your location as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

292
00:12:08,279 --> 00:12:13,319
is going to go over<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some of the case</font>

293
00:12:09,569 --> 00:12:14,969
studies and then a<font color="#CCCCCC"> four step</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

294
00:12:13,319 --> 00:12:18,269
verifying the filming and the upload

dates so<font color="#E5E5E5"> upload dates are able to be</font>

296
00:12:18,269 --> 00:12:22,350
determined by the date that it has been

298
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:26,100
developed by groups like witness and

299
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:29,430
others that help with this process

300
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:31,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">sometimes you know it may be difficult</font>

301
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:33,930
to verify the day that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was actually</font>

302
00:12:31,170 --> 00:12:36,360

304
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:41,610
later<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we have to cross references</font>

00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:45,689

00:12:45,689 --> 00:12:52,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">organizations and then the last step is</font>

308
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:54,420
to publish this into our database so we

309
00:12:52,019 --> 00:12:56,579
make our database<font color="#E5E5E5"> publicly available and</font>

you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> please keep this up</font>

640
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:28,070
it's actually two questions first

641
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:31,459
question is<font color="#E5E5E5"> and do you have a narrative</font>

642
00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:33,590
which brings the facts together in a way

643
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:35,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">i'm not talking about a actual narrative</font>

644
00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:37,399
but what this different parties involved

645
00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:39,770
in this war are saying and what<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're</font>

claiming about these events<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

platform and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the second</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> question</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is how</font>

650
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:47,990
can we help<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we have a lot of</font>
