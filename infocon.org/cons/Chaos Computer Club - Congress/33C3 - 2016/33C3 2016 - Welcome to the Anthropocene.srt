introduction I can skip a little bit

8
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:31,509
about this but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i do want to make it</font>

00:00:28,689 --> 00:00:32,980
clear that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm not a geologist myself i</font>

00:00:38,649 --> 00:00:41,350
absolutely do it

15
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:43,930
that's one of the few programs that

16
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:46,300
definitely works for you<font color="#CCCCCC"> you might</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:48,100
to take care of some credit points

<font color="#E5E5E5">it is worth it</font>

22
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,190
so now<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think a little crash course is</font>

23
00:00:57,370 --> 00:01:03,550
an order about<font color="#CCCCCC"> chrono stratigraphy so</font>

24
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:06,789
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the science of analyzing rock</font>

that the so-called golden spikes and

these are needed by the geologists to

94
00:04:06,769 --> 00:04:12,950
define the boundary layers between the

95
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:15,200
straps so they can for example in the

and of course closely tied to that is

208
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:04,870
the question<font color="#CCCCCC"> when did the anthracene</font>

hand in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> extinction of many large</font>

237
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:16,240
therefore there has been the suggestion

238
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:18,130
that basically the whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> at holocene</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">anthracene however this has received</font>

241
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:26,079
little attention by the working group so

242
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:28,599
we move on a few thousand years and now

243
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:31,810
we have all over the world cultures and

244
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:33,190
civilizations rising and with that of

245
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:35,680
course you can imagine you need some

253
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:55,540
because we find these signals all over

the world and still after hundreds and

255
00:10:55,540 --> 00:11:00,310
thousands of years you can still detect

00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:58,590
the pollution from coal dust from<font color="#CCCCCC"> coal</font>

00:11:52,860 --> 00:12:00,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">soot and now because especially the</font>

00:11:58,590 --> 00:12:02,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">European nations</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they are basically</font>

275
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:07,860
also have a global<font color="#CCCCCC"> signal of</font>

anthropogenic pollution

277
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:14,130
however for some reason this option was

278
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:16,200
also rejected so<font color="#E5E5E5"> and now the question</font>

279
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:19,439
becomes political because after now all

280
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:22,200
of this<font color="#CCCCCC"> has happened in the very far</font>

away<font color="#CCCCCC"> past and nobody alive was basically</font>

00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:28,830
at fault<font color="#E5E5E5"> but now we're entering the 20th</font>

is entering the geological record for

304
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:23,730
now we basically have a little showdown

between the nuclear weapons here and the

309
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:34,230
topics have been featured at this

310
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:37,199
conference before so i encourage you to

311
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:38,940
rewatch<font color="#E5E5E5"> these talks in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> January as early</font>

tsunami of all of these talks<font color="#E5E5E5"> you there</font>

314
00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:45,689
is interestingly a connection between

00:13:44,010 --> 00:13:47,460
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> topics on the one hand we have</font>

316
00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:48,990
this engineering and physical and of

317
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:51,090
course political topic of nuclear

318
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:54,330

321
00:13:56,940 --> 00:14:01,260
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe know the so-called radiocarbon</font>

322
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:05,520
method that is used to determine the age

323
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:06,990
of biological samples<font color="#E5E5E5"> so you know that</font>

324
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:09,630
in the atmosphere there's a certain

amount of radioactive<font color="#E5E5E5"> carbon</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 14</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

326
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:14,730
filters down to co2 to the plants the

00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:17,010
animals<font color="#E5E5E5"> and when you have some kind of</font>

329
00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:21,900
decay starts both on the biological side

330
00:14:19,530 --> 00:14:24,600
and also in terms of radioactive carbon

331
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:26,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">and when you find a biological sample</font>

332
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:28,950
you can measure how much<font color="#CCCCCC"> radiocarbon is</font>

00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:31,620
left<font color="#E5E5E5"> and thereby calculate backwards</font>

336
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:42,360
because we because of the nuclear

337
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:46,800
weapons testing we have added a lot of

338

<font color="#CCCCCC">it is delayed again a bit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">is the so-called radiocarbon</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bombs bike</font>

343
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:04,230
so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> added a lot of carbon-14</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> into the</font>

344
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:06,720
atmosphere<font color="#E5E5E5"> so biological samples that</font>

345
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:09,210

346
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:11,100
with a lot more radioactive carbon<font color="#E5E5E5"> so in</font>

00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:12,780
the future<font color="#CCCCCC"> acura logical record they</font>

348
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:13,740
will appear much younger than they

actually are

350
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:19,560
however in the near future we will reach

351
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:22,270
the equilibrium point basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the</font>

352
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:24,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">baseline again and then</font>

353
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:28,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">depending on which of these</font>

00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:34,090
take<font color="#E5E5E5"> future samples will appear much</font>

356
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:36,820
older because we have diluted the

00:15:34,090 --> 00:15:38,830
radioactive carbon from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> red nuclear</font>

are burning<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you can easily imagine</font>

361
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:50,860
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> 5370 years half-life</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the fossil</font>

363
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:56,320
old they do not contain any radioactive

364
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:58,210
carbon anymore so we are in effect

365
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:00,550
polluting both<font color="#CCCCCC"> the present and the</font>

367
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:12,370

369
00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:15,970
now we basically have the end of this

00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:19,240

also the co2 concentration in the

376
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:36,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">yeah the final vote was 10 25</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> basically</font>

377
00:16:33,010 --> 00:16:38,200
for the nuclear weapons and remember<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

378
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:40,450
mean we're talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about geologists here</font>

379
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:42,040
they need to have stuff in the sediments

00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:44,470
in the rocks or something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that actually</font>

topics<font color="#E5E5E5"> but now the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> track</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> goes on we have</font>

390
00:17:04,359 --> 00:17:11,229
the the problem here that<font color="#CCCCCC"> sign sometimes</font>

391
00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:13,450
needs to be a bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> now devoid</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of emotions</font>

392
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:14,920
to keep a clear head<font color="#E5E5E5"> because that's how</font>

393
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:16,959
it works<font color="#E5E5E5"> now have to stick to the</font>

394
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:19,150
science but we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> we shouldn't forget</font>

395
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:21,730
that these are quite horrible topics in

396
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:23,170
some cases<font color="#E5E5E5"> and also we have a mixture</font>

397
00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:26,650
here now again as<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mentioned before</font>

398
00:17:23,170 --> 00:17:28,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">between the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah geological part of the</font>

00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:35,049
and all the ecological problems that

00:17:33,370 --> 00:17:39,668
arise from fossil fuel emissions

403
00:17:35,049 --> 00:17:44,049

so what we most likely have already done

is to stop the cycle of ice ages and<font color="#CCCCCC"> war</font>

about four years and now they've moved

599
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:07,919
on to a new framing of the issue called

for me where the controversy gets really

00:26:23,610 --> 00:26:30,479
in a way that points the blame on us as

very catastrophic for not only the human

millions of species and in fact<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're</font>

perhaps moving into what's called being

<font color="#CCCCCC">and it obvious skates the fact that we</font>
