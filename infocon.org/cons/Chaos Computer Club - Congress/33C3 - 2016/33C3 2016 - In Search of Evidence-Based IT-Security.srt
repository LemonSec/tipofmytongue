00:06:27,979 --> 00:06:30,680
like a food supplement<font color="#E5E5E5"> vitamin</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> C</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pill</font>

132
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:32,780
works

133
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:35,570
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> seriously done is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so-called</font>

134
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:38,448

135
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:41,810
we just take a group of people that may

136
00:06:38,449 --> 00:06:44,990
have some some illness and then we split

137
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:46,490
them randomly into groups and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's it's</font>

138
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:49,280
crucial that this is done randomly

139
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:51,889
<font color="#CCCCCC">because we don't want to have some</font>

140
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:55,190
statistical thing that we chose one

141
00:06:51,889 --> 00:06:57,409
group that is maybe more<font color="#E5E5E5"> sick than</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

142
00:06:55,190 --> 00:07:00,169
other group to begin with and then this

143
00:06:57,409 --> 00:07:02,990
screws with our<font color="#E5E5E5"> results so we need to</font>

144
00:07:00,169 --> 00:07:04,969
split them randomly into groups and a

145
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:06,590
simple way would be<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay one group gets</font>

146
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:10,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">medication</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the other group gets a</font>

147
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:11,989
placebo and then we see what happens in

148
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:13,400
reality it's usually more complicated

149
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:15,770
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> usually we have a situation</font>

150
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:18,109
where we already have a known good

151
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:19,758
medication and we have a new medication

152
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:22,610
and we just want to know if the new

153
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:25,009
medication is better so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> compare</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> an</font>

154
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:28,039
old<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the new medication and we also</font>

155
00:07:25,009 --> 00:07:31,430
may have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a an alternative to medication</font>

156
00:07:28,039 --> 00:07:33,380
like exercise<font color="#CCCCCC"> dietary changes and what</font>

157
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:35,419
you may want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay maybe we have</font>

158
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:37,550
a medication that works<font color="#E5E5E5"> but doing</font>

159
00:07:35,419 --> 00:07:39,979
exercise works even better and maybe

160
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:41,539
taking both the medication and<font color="#E5E5E5"> exercise</font>

161
00:07:39,979 --> 00:07:45,349
at the same time works even more better

162
00:07:41,539 --> 00:07:47,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">but this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the general idea so we randomly</font>

163
00:07:45,349 --> 00:07:51,710
split people into groups and<font color="#E5E5E5"> test what</font>

164
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:53,810
happens and then we usually don't really

165
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:55,250
care about a single study because<font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

166
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:56,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">are far too many things that can go</font>

167
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:58,340
wrong

168
00:07:56,030 --> 00:08:00,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">so what we usually care about is all the</font>

169
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:02,229
scientific evidence we have as a whole

170
00:08:00,969 --> 00:08:04,748
and that's why we're doing a

171
00:08:02,229 --> 00:08:06,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">meta-analysis which is we're trying to</font>

172
00:08:04,749 --> 00:08:08,110
search for all the studies that have

173
00:08:06,279 --> 00:08:10,659
been<font color="#E5E5E5"> on a particular topic</font>

174
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:13,629
ideally randomized<font color="#CCCCCC"> controlled trials and</font>

175
00:08:10,659 --> 00:08:15,669
we combine the results<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is obviously</font>

176
00:08:13,629 --> 00:08:17,739
sometimes complicated because we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

177
00:08:15,669 --> 00:08:21,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">might have studies with different groups</font>

178
00:08:17,739 --> 00:08:23,739
of the population<font color="#CCCCCC"> they cannot always be</font>

179
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:25,989
easily compared<font color="#E5E5E5"> but that's the idea idea</font>

180
00:08:23,739 --> 00:08:27,849
so we have many studies and then we

181
00:08:25,989 --> 00:08:29,709
combine the<font color="#E5E5E5"> results and look at the</font>

182
00:08:27,849 --> 00:08:33,938
whole body of evidence

183
00:08:29,709 --> 00:08:37,328
<font color="#E5E5E5">yeah so we call that evidence-based</font>

184
00:08:33,938 --> 00:08:38,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">medicine so ideally we want to make all</font>

185
00:08:37,328 --> 00:08:42,098
<font color="#E5E5E5">decisions based on high-quality</font>

186
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:46,959
scientific evidence which very often

00:08:42,099 --> 00:08:51,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">maternity</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this qualifies</font>

188
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:53,410
now<font color="#CCCCCC"> i want to point out that one</font>

189
00:08:51,339 --> 00:08:55,360
shouldn't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a2</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> idealized view on</font>

190
00:08:53,410 --> 00:09:01,329
science because there are many problems

191
00:08:55,360 --> 00:09:03,850
here the top one is actually the most

192
00:09:01,329 --> 00:09:06,099
popular<font color="#CCCCCC"> open-access paper of all times</font>

193
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:07,629
<font color="#CCCCCC">worse is why most</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> published research</font>

194
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:10,660
findings are false

195
00:09:07,629 --> 00:09:15,759
it has been<font color="#CCCCCC"> published in 2005</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's</font>

196
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:17,559
actually not<font color="#E5E5E5"> very controversial so and</font>

197
00:09:15,759 --> 00:09:20,079
the middle one points to an issue that

198
00:09:17,559 --> 00:09:23,259
has been debated in recent years a lot

199
00:09:20,079 --> 00:09:26,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">where there was a big experiment to try</font>

200
00:09:23,259 --> 00:09:28,240
to replicate studies in psychology and

201
00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:31,269
they find out that they could they were

202
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:33,939
only able to replicate the result of

203
00:09:31,269 --> 00:09:36,250
thirty-seven percent of the studies<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

204
00:09:33,939 --> 00:09:38,410
the majority of studies it seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> either</font>

205
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:41,800
they are wrong<font color="#CCCCCC"> or the replication was</font>

206
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:43,870
wrong but it seems there's a problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font>

207
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:46,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is not only affecting psychology</font>

208
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:48,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">the you have the same problem in many</font>

209
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:49,959
fields of<font color="#CCCCCC"> sciences for example</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a</font>

210
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:54,550
very similar debate in cancer research

211
00:09:49,959 --> 00:09:56,258
and the lowest<font color="#CCCCCC"> point</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something that many</font>

212
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:58,809
clinical trials findings never get

213
00:09:56,259 --> 00:10:01,269
published<font color="#E5E5E5"> which is also very important</font>

214
00:09:58,809 --> 00:10:03,519
thing to consider that the science we're

215
00:10:01,269 --> 00:10:04,480
seeing is not all the science that has

216
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:06,519
happened

217
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:09,699
we very<font color="#E5E5E5"> often have a situation where</font>

218
00:10:06,519 --> 00:10:11,769
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> do a study and then based on the</font>

219
00:10:09,699 --> 00:10:13,180
result they decide whether it's

220
00:10:11,769 --> 00:10:15,490
interesting and gets

221
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:17,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">bush or whether it's just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gets thrown</font>

222
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:23,440
away<font color="#CCCCCC"> so this</font>

223
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:26,439
<font color="#CCCCCC">yeah so if you want to evaluate what's</font>

224
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:29,110
good or bad science<font color="#E5E5E5"> then there are some</font>

225
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:30,730
things we can look at something very

226
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:33,730
obvious is if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have a very small</font>

227
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:35,440
number of research subjects<font color="#E5E5E5"> so sometimes</font>

228
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:38,290
you see studies where people say<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

229
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:40,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">we've tested this with 10 people and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

230
00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:41,740
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay that's maybe not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

231
00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:45,790
meaningful it could be just coincidence

232
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:47,650
could be a statistical<font color="#E5E5E5"> average then</font>

233
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:49,900
which is a very common thing not only

234
00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:52,240
with the quality of the science itself

235
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:54,130
but also with the reporting about

236
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:57,250
science like when the media reports

237
00:10:54,130 --> 00:11:00,010
about it is that correlations are

238
00:10:57,250 --> 00:11:02,680
reported as if they were<font color="#CCCCCC"> causing results</font>

239
00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:05,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">so what's happening here is if we have a</font>

240
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:07,959
set of data and we may find out all the

241
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:10,750
people who have property<font color="#E5E5E5"> a also have</font>

242
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:13,600
property<font color="#CCCCCC"> B then we could conclude ok a</font>

243
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:17,140
causes B<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it could also be that</font>

244
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:19,450
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> they are it could also be that</font>

245
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:20,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">their</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so-called confounder which means</font>

246
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:23,410
we have something completely different

247
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:27,640
that we may not even know about

248
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:29,740
that's causing both<font color="#CCCCCC"> a and B so and this</font>

249
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:31,840
is generally a problem in<font color="#CCCCCC"> our</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> studies</font>

250
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:34,090
where you're using an existing data set

251
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:35,740
and trying to find something in it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

252
00:11:34,090 --> 00:11:38,410
that's why we're doing these<font color="#CCCCCC"> controlled</font>

253
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:40,840
trials<font color="#CCCCCC"> very splitting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> groups randomly</font>

254
00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:43,060
into two groups<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we can exclude that</font>

255
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:48,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">there are some some other factor that's</font>

256
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:50,439
happening here and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> yes sometimes we</font>

257
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:54,310
only have a single study or very few

258
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:56,560
studies<font color="#CCCCCC"> so we usually want good science</font>

259
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:58,989
to be based on many studies we want

260
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:03,729
science to be replicated independently

261
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:05,650
and then we have think that's called

262
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:07,570
publication bias and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

263
00:12:05,650 --> 00:12:10,900
mentioned<font color="#CCCCCC"> earlier with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we don't see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

264
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:13,600
all the studies that are done<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we may</font>

265
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:16,930
have a situation where<font color="#E5E5E5"> pharmaceutical</font>

266
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:18,370
company makes a trial on medication and

267
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:20,739
it turns out the medication doesn't

268
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:23,230
really help<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then they don't publish</font>

269
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:25,030
the trial and then they do another trial

270
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:26,259
and there it seems like the medication

272
00:12:26,259 --> 00:12:32,319
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you can see that like if you only</font>

see the positive studies<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you don't</font>

00:12:32,319 --> 00:12:37,269
see the negative studies then and then

275
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:39,160
you try to combine these results like in

276
00:12:37,269 --> 00:12:43,359
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> meta-analysis</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> then you get this cute</font>

you could try<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay maybe if I just use</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">this app selection</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of my data</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i might</font>

286
00:13:04,479 --> 00:13:08,559
you can take some random data and you

287
00:13:07,029 --> 00:13:13,149
will find something that looks like a

289
00:13:13,149 --> 00:13:16,779
a problem to do this but you should be

290
00:13:14,679 --> 00:13:18,549
transparent about it if you were first

291
00:13:16,779 --> 00:13:19,749
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> searching for something and then</font>

292
00:13:18,549 --> 00:13:22,329
later you're searching for something

these groups and then I published that

305
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:53,049
in a trice register because then if you

306
00:13:49,989 --> 00:13:55,929
later change what you were studying then

307
00:13:53,049 --> 00:13:58,329
other people can see that so<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

something that may look a bit like

if you detect them<font color="#E5E5E5"> ever</font>

like counting the citations of papers

itself is a very controversial thing but

<font color="#CCCCCC">i cannot go into that but there's the</font>

394
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:42,790
whole debate about whether you should

so the first<font color="#CCCCCC"> one hears this candidate</font>

00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:05,110
indistinguishable<font color="#CCCCCC"> ility obfuscation and</font>

405
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:12,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">now I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i could ask if we have a edit</font>

406
00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:14,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">average user</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> who</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is using the internet</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">facebook whatever</font>

409
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:21,760
how does this matter for him<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you have</font>

410
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:26,260
an answer for that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I would really like</font>

411
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:28,030
to hear it talk to me later<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

412
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:33,010
you could ask similar questions<font color="#CCCCCC"> four of</font>

413
00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:35,470
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> papers</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i had to go to number</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 11</font>

414
00:18:33,010 --> 00:18:38,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">very found something that sounded like</font>

415
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:41,410
it was actually about real software that

416
00:18:38,170 --> 00:18:44,110
was a paper about<font color="#CCCCCC"> android member and</font>

417
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:45,790
also at number 20<font color="#CCCCCC"> i found another paper</font>

418
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:49,629
that was about real software which was

419
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:51,670
the lucky<font color="#E5E5E5"> 13 paper and that one made me</font>

420
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:53,320
kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> question myself because this is</font>

421
00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:55,330
the kind of paper that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

422
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:57,908
really care about<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I do a lot of</font>

423
00:18:55,330 --> 00:19:01,120
crypto stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this is a crypto attack</font>

424
00:18:57,909 --> 00:19:06,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a timing attack and it's really</font>

425
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:08,678
hard to pull that<font color="#CCCCCC"> a cough and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's so</font>

426
00:19:06,399 --> 00:19:11,320
hard that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm almost certain that this</font>

427
00:19:08,679 --> 00:19:14,350
attack has never been used in the wire

428
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:16,658
to attack a real user<font color="#E5E5E5"> but these are the</font>

429
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:19,840
kinds of papers we find interesting

430
00:19:16,659 --> 00:19:21,880
because we say oh they were able to pull

431
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:23,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">off this interesting attack</font>

432
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:26,409
that's great<font color="#CCCCCC"> that questions all the way</font>

433
00:19:23,799 --> 00:19:28,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">how we did encryption and it had a</font>

434
00:19:26,409 --> 00:19:30,009
pretty big impact

435
00:19:28,269 --> 00:19:31,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">yeah</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm also proud that i found a</font>

436
00:19:30,009 --> 00:19:36,909
little mistake in that paper actually

437
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:40,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's not very important but so yeah so</font>

438
00:19:36,909 --> 00:19:43,090
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah but in this whole list with</font>

439
00:19:40,809 --> 00:19:45,220
26 papers that were the most cited

440
00:19:43,090 --> 00:19:47,799
papers<font color="#E5E5E5"> there was not a single paper that</font>

441
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:49,779
was doing anything with real users<font color="#E5E5E5"> where</font>

442
00:19:47,799 --> 00:19:51,759
they were trying to see what's happening

443
00:19:49,779 --> 00:19:54,070
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> we will use us act with the</font>

00:19:51,759 --> 00:19:56,019
<font color="#CCCCCC">internet to something about security</font>

445
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:58,450
so it seems<font color="#CCCCCC"> the users not really</font>

446
00:19:56,019 --> 00:20:03,909
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> IT security research cares a</font>

447
00:19:58,450 --> 00:20:06,070
lot about<font color="#CCCCCC"> so my feeling is most academic</font>

448
00:20:03,909 --> 00:20:08,559
research<font color="#CCCCCC"> in IT security is comparable to</font>

449
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:10,658
basic research<font color="#E5E5E5"> when we talk about I</font>

450
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:12,908
don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> homomorphic encryption are</font>

00:20:10,659 --> 00:20:15,009
indistinguishable<font color="#CCCCCC"> latifah station</font>

452
00:20:12,909 --> 00:20:16,929
these are<font color="#CCCCCC"> crypto</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> theories that may lead</font>

453
00:20:15,009 --> 00:20:20,289
to some interesting products for in the

454
00:20:16,929 --> 00:20:22,840
future and that's fine<font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean basic</font>

455
00:20:20,289 --> 00:20:25,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">researchers totally fine but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I feel be</font>

456
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:27,850
completely missing the<font color="#CCCCCC"> applied research</font>

457
00:20:25,029 --> 00:20:29,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">and if we do like the more if you look</font>

458
00:20:27,850 --> 00:20:33,370
at the more practical research<font color="#CCCCCC"> I feel it</font>

459
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:35,590
tends to go into interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> subproblems</font>

460
00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:38,408
<font color="#CCCCCC">but not the most important problems</font>

461
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:39,129
which<font color="#E5E5E5"> is also kind of fine but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I feel</font>

462
00:20:38,409 --> 00:20:40,659
this

463
00:20:39,129 --> 00:20:44,080
there's a whole big area we're missing

464
00:20:40,659 --> 00:20:48,039
here

465
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:50,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">so what we do what if you would say we</font>

466
00:20:48,039 --> 00:20:52,929
want to do a randomized<font color="#CCCCCC"> control trial on</font>

467
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:55,600
a security software because<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok get a</font>

468
00:20:52,929 --> 00:20:57,549
large group of users and randomly split

469
00:20:55,600 --> 00:21:00,129
them<font color="#E5E5E5"> in groups</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we have some groups that</font>

470
00:20:57,549 --> 00:21:02,230
use some different IT security products

471
00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:04,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">we could say one group uses some</font>

472
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:07,659
alternative treatment which could be

473
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:09,820
something like applying regular updates

474
00:21:07,659 --> 00:21:11,799
and doing application whitelisting which

475
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:15,730
is generally considered the most viable

476
00:21:11,799 --> 00:21:17,559
alternative to antivirus software and we

477
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:19,690
can't say<font color="#E5E5E5"> one group gets</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a training</font>

478
00:21:17,559 --> 00:21:23,139
where we say<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> click on these</font>

479
00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:24,909
email attachments<font color="#CCCCCC"> i have to say here I</font>

480
00:21:23,139 --> 00:21:28,000
don't think training<font color="#E5E5E5"> use this is a very</font>

481
00:21:24,909 --> 00:21:31,029
very good strategy<font color="#CCCCCC"> but i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think we should</font>

482
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,980
test<font color="#E5E5E5"> that anyway and then we could have</font>

483
00:21:31,029 --> 00:21:38,559
a placebo group where we say<font color="#CCCCCC"> it just do</font>

484
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:40,809
the same thing you did before<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then</font>

485
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:44,168
we try to<font color="#CCCCCC"> measure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> security incidents</font>

486
00:21:40,809 --> 00:21:48,010
which may be tricky to even decide when

487
00:21:44,169 --> 00:21:50,409
a security incident happen<font color="#E5E5E5"> then we could</font>

488
00:21:48,010 --> 00:21:52,480
also try to measure<font color="#E5E5E5"> what side effects</font>

489
00:21:50,409 --> 00:21:54,909
does this have two things<font color="#CCCCCC"> crash these</font>

490
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:58,539
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> get slower what does it cost</font>

491
00:21:54,909 --> 00:22:03,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">we have some down times and then after</font>

492
00:21:58,539 --> 00:22:04,629
<font color="#CCCCCC">sometime we compare the result</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> now</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

493
00:22:03,279 --> 00:22:06,789
have discussed this with a number of

494
00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:08,980
people before I did this talk and the

495
00:22:06,789 --> 00:22:11,470
the first reaction that usually comes in

496
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:12,880
some form of this is really hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

497
00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:16,870
there's this problem and that problem

498
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:20,679
and that problem and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i totally agree</font>

499
00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:22,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is really hard sciences heart that</font>

500
00:22:20,679 --> 00:22:28,809
<font color="#CCCCCC">stress</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how it is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't mean we</font>

501
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:33,279
shouldn't

502
00:22:28,809 --> 00:22:35,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">so some problems that would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> show up for</font>

503
00:22:33,279 --> 00:22:37,090
you could ask<font color="#E5E5E5"> what about the ethics of</font>

504
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:38,710
such a trial because you would say you

505
00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:40,990
give some security products<font color="#CCCCCC"> to some</font>

506
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:42,190
people and not<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ever</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so do you put</font>

507
00:22:40,990 --> 00:22:44,379
them at risk

508
00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:47,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'm but if you think about it that's a</font>

509
00:22:44,379 --> 00:22:49,870
very comparable situation to medicine<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

510
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:51,610
you test the medical<font color="#E5E5E5"> drug</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> then you give</font>

511
00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:53,559
the drug to some people and you don't

512
00:22:51,610 --> 00:22:55,508
give it to other people<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it could be</font>

513
00:22:53,559 --> 00:22:57,039
that this drug help some people and

514
00:22:55,509 --> 00:22:59,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">doesn't help the others but it could</font>

515
00:22:57,039 --> 00:23:02,289
also be that this drug has a risk and

516
00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:04,809
that people suffer from taking that rock

517
00:23:02,289 --> 00:23:06,908
<font color="#CCCCCC">but we generally have the idea</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

518
00:23:04,809 --> 00:23:09,850
medicine that if we don't know whether

519
00:23:06,909 --> 00:23:11,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">drug helps then testing it is an ethical</font>

520
00:23:09,850 --> 00:23:13,928
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing because it will help many more</font>

521
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:16,899
people in the future

522
00:23:13,929 --> 00:23:19,509
<font color="#CCCCCC">yeah then we may wonder how do we</font>

523
00:23:16,899 --> 00:23:21,070
reliably matter<font color="#E5E5E5"> what's an incident</font>

524
00:23:19,509 --> 00:23:25,419
because we may have situations where

525
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:27,639
it's not even clear what was a<font color="#E5E5E5"> hack or</font>

526
00:23:25,419 --> 00:23:31,149
you have been hacked and you don't know

527
00:23:27,639 --> 00:23:33,189
about it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> he you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> probably get very</font>

528
00:23:31,149 --> 00:23:35,469
different results whether you have

529
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:38,889
someone<font color="#CCCCCC"> who is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just affected by the</font>

538
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:04,629
I think there are many things that we

could test<font color="#E5E5E5"> for such tests like their</font>

both<font color="#E5E5E5"> the good and the bad example</font>

00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:37,500
so this was a treat from the FCC the

things<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah so at some point they</font>

554
00:24:50,670 --> 00:24:53,610
found out they actually had no

555
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:55,740
scientific evidence for this

recommendation<font color="#E5E5E5"> to change passwords often</font>

557
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:59,160
and they try to find out why are you

558
00:24:57,630 --> 00:25:01,140
recommending this and then they said

559
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:09,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we're recommending this because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

561
00:25:09,030 --> 00:25:14,160
then they basically recommended the

562
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:16,290
opposite they said<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay we we have</font>

563
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:18,240
reconsidered this<font color="#CCCCCC"> we looked at the</font>

567
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:29,940
you should not change your passwords on

571
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:39,990
felt the quality of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> studies was</font>

572
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:43,050
not very high so all of them<font color="#CCCCCC"> are based</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on observational data that mean they</font>

didn't make any intervention where they

575
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:49,830
put people in groups but they<font color="#CCCCCC"> they did</font>

576
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:52,560
things like they had<font color="#E5E5E5"> password data from</font>

00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:54,360
a company<font color="#CCCCCC"> where at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some point they had a</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">points not</font>

580
00:25:55,080 --> 00:26:01,199
and then there was one which was trying

581
00:25:59,070 --> 00:26:02,939
to make a theoretical model of password

582
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:06,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">breaks and password changes and how much</font>

583
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:07,530
that matters but the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the basis of all of</font>

these studies with observational data

that's also bad so<font color="#CCCCCC"> many</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people use a</font>

they didn't have scientific evidence for

their recommendations and they said okay

609
00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:06,930
we have to look at the scientific

671

studies it's actually the highest

672
00:29:42,059 --> 00:29:45,239
quality that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> do double-blind</font>

673
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:47,519
randomized control studies which means

674
00:29:45,239 --> 00:29:49,080
neither the experiment<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> nor the</font>

participant knows whether it takes

676
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:53,699
placebo or the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Attic actual medication</font>

677
00:29:51,599 --> 00:29:55,349
you think that is something that you can

678
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:56,759
actually implement because people act

679
00:29:55,349 --> 00:29:59,249
differently if they know they have the

680
00:29:56,759 --> 00:30:01,080
placebo or if they have the drug<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font>

681
00:29:59,249 --> 00:30:03,779
greatly interferes the randomized

683
00:30:03,779 --> 00:30:07,679
blinding studies if you can do that

684
00:30:05,429 --> 00:30:10,139
depends on your situation because<font color="#CCCCCC"> their</font>

685
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:11,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">situation where you cannot blind if it's</font>

686
00:30:10,139 --> 00:30:13,769
something that the user has to act if

687
00:30:11,669 --> 00:30:14,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">you do but if possible</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you are blinding</font>

688
00:30:13,769 --> 00:30:18,179
us better

689
00:30:14,609 --> 00:30:21,059
<font color="#CCCCCC">ok sorry unfortunately we don't have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> any</font>

690
00:30:18,179 --> 00:30:23,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">more time for questions but as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i said i</font>

691
00:30:21,059 --> 00:30:27,120
will be prepared and ready to ask some

692
00:30:23,789 --> 00:30:31,430
questions right here<font color="#CCCCCC"> thanks</font>
