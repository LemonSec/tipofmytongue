00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:13,320
[Music]

2
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:19,180
so hello all right hello today we'll be

3
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:21,130
listening to the talk technologies

4
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:24,910
foreign against digital sovereignty with

5
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:28,869
just two of the three promised speakers

6
00:00:28,869 --> 00:00:31,029
but will still have enough academic

7
00:00:31,029 --> 00:00:32,980
firepower fun day let me start we have

8
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:37,989
professor for cosmic and we teach a vice

9
00:00:37,989 --> 00:00:40,239
moment moment moment moment moment hold

10
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:42,850
on hold on Nick Nick Moline Ohio House

11
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:44,860
yeah the University for technology

12
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:47,680
Berlin a slight a touchdown and Stefan

13
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,110
looks could unfortunately not make it

14
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:51,430
even though he has a very cool

15
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:55,690
University give a big hand to our

16
00:00:55,690 --> 00:01:06,580
speaker please yes my Khan yes thank you

17
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:10,950
very much for the friendly nourishment

18
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:13,930
as was mentioned this is a joint work

19
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:16,869
between me Stefan look and for her glass

20
00:01:16,869 --> 00:01:19,420
book and as you may have noticed

21
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:21,220
technologies for and against digital

22
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:23,020
sovereignty as a bit of a weird title

23
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:28,030
for a talk the title is also the same

24
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:31,720
title as a task handed out by the

25
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:35,500
digital ministry of photo shoots and

26
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:38,890
they wanted a project on digital

27
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:40,960
technology and we sent we handed in a

28
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,590
proposal and surprisingly one that I

29
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:49,659
claim and today I am my colleague Volker

30
00:01:49,659 --> 00:01:52,689
perfect i would shed some light on a

31
00:01:52,689 --> 00:01:56,110
couple of aspects of that we have a big

32
00:01:56,110 --> 00:01:58,360
bunch of slides it will be a big quick

33
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:01,450
glossing over these but or point of ease

34
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:05,020
and would like to thank the ministry

35
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:07,210
that this city will be published in

36
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:10,600
spring and should be visible in more

37
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:17,010
detail there are a lot of things

38
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:20,290
escalating in 2016 as you've noticed and

39
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:22,750
since we've been looking at the whole

40
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:25,470
affair for over 10 years

41
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:28,860
there are a couple of things that are as

42
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:31,660
important enough to be warranting

43
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:36,610
discussion right now and one of these is

44
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:38,860
the security of the Internet of Things

45
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:44,430
and there are positions emerging

46
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:47,950
recently i haven't seen in the last 20

47
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:50,860
years or so which caused me to notice

48
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:53,590
that the the state of security was

49
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:58,600
getting a bit precarious relating to

50
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:05,620
microsoft for example where where the

51
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:08,200
situation's bit more friendlier and some

52
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,790
people might not like that in the

53
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:14,430
audience and i'd like to discuss the

54
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:17,500
sociology girl implications how we

55
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:23,200
manage technology we can try to predict

56
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,900
some technological development and their

57
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:28,900
effects on society society and we can

58
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:32,860
work on figuring things out that

59
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:34,870
technology allows us how to structure

60
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:38,110
society but first up we have to present

61
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:39,820
the technical situation and that's not

62
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:42,250
that funny or hybrid Schneider presented

63
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:48,510
it it's a bit like the end of my time I

64
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:51,730
usually refer to the talks of horn honk

65
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:54,120
security nightmares of the past

66
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:59,769
millennium and my point referring to

67
00:03:59,769 --> 00:04:02,320
that is there's one simple conclusion

68
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,600
computers can be hacked if I connect

69
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,700
something to an Internet it can be

70
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:08,799
hacked connected systems connected to a

71
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:12,130
network can be hatched which leads us to

72
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:15,340
the conclusion that if we have an

73
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:18,850
intelligent thermostat then that is a

74
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:21,459
full computer connected to the internet

75
00:04:21,459 --> 00:04:24,370
and people from the outside could be

76
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:28,600
interested in that and again as Bruce

77
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:32,979
Schneier has said there is a big failure

78
00:04:32,979 --> 00:04:34,320
of the market

79
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:38,190
the embedded devices we have a salt in

80
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:40,730
great amounts too small a small prices

81
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:43,800
will stick around in that system for a

82
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:47,130
long time without any one fig realizing

83
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:49,680
that they are attacking both systems so

84
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,440
now we have this nightmarish security

85
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:59,790
disasters 900,000 telecom clients flew

86
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:02,640
from the the net because of a

87
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:05,910
programming error due to some real fault

88
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:10,290
and we have to this figure out that

89
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:12,120
there are millions of devices out there

90
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:16,380
that can be used for attacks and I want

91
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:18,990
to point out that you'll probably don't

92
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:21,300
have to fear a drone crashing into your

93
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:24,150
fridge recently but if you're evil evil

94
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:27,120
fridge participates an attack against US

95
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,930
military systems then according to the

96
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:32,670
current situation of the law that's an

97
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:36,630
act of war and the US government has the

98
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:40,110
right to react against that and we do

99
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:44,120
have a big trust in the US government

100
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:54,210
since I decades but that is a point

101
00:05:54,210 --> 00:06:00,260
where we need to rethink some things and

102
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:03,660
the next three slides that might not

103
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:06,030
look this bad have kept me sleepless a

104
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:08,790
couple of nights because we we need

105
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:12,660
something like a tough like warranty

106
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:16,950
situation liability shift to the

107
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:20,760
manufacturer that can prevent us from

108
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:23,850
some hacking possibilities that will

109
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:29,390
impede the the hacking of systems we

110
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:33,750
formulate this as small as possible but

111
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:35,460
we need a definition of the lifetime of

112
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:37,740
devices and we need warranties that

113
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:40,320
these devices receive security updates

114
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:42,840
during that lifetime

115
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:46,710
secondly we need to make sure that

116
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:50,550
things that cost 3 4 euros an

117
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:54,330
intelligent thermostat might you be used

118
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:58,770
over decades that's a very quick lived

119
00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:01,410
market so manufacturers will disappear

120
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:04,280
this is a nightmare it is not philosophy

121
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:06,900
we have had the the case of the of

122
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:08,970
Chinese cameras that disappeared from

123
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:11,430
the market we just need to worker at the

124
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:13,740
fact that manufactures will disappear

125
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:15,570
and systems will be around that we

126
00:07:15,570 --> 00:07:18,990
cannot update date cannot make secure so

127
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:22,970
what we need is a well-defined lifetime

128
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:26,010
the manufacturer do need to have the

129
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:29,210
motivation to choose appropriately and

130
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:32,370
we also need the the security that

131
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:35,310
systems are released as open source if

132
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:38,100
the manufacturer cannot update them any

133
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:40,050
longer and finally the third and most

134
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:42,740
critical point and because these

135
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:46,100
companies may disappear really quickly

136
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:50,160
we have come to the conclusion that we

137
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,979
need to have a source code s chrome off

138
00:07:52,979 --> 00:07:56,460
the manufacture because if the company

139
00:07:56,460 --> 00:08:00,300
goes bankrupt then there there needs to

140
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:02,880
be an assurance that the source code can

141
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:06,599
be published as open source and that the

142
00:08:06,599 --> 00:08:08,880
community and others have the chance to

143
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:11,099
fix books that might still be present

144
00:08:11,099 --> 00:08:15,200
the open source is really a part of

145
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:18,450
personal sovereignty because otherwise

146
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:20,849
we will not know what could happen to

147
00:08:20,849 --> 00:08:24,690
our coffeemaker so when you want to use

148
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:28,590
these devices and we don't have to worry

149
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:30,419
just about us drones but we also to

150
00:08:30,419 --> 00:08:32,339
worry about the nails of service tunnels

151
00:08:32,339 --> 00:08:36,380
of service and and we need some sort of

152
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:40,260
defensive mechanism heights of Zion and

153
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:43,200
the movie fan of cap and it'll be

154
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,320
extremely unfunny when we we have an

155
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:50,390
attack based on our heating system a

156
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:52,759
denial of service

157
00:08:52,759 --> 00:08:55,589
then you fight a lot of effects of

158
00:08:55,589 --> 00:09:00,300
people's ability to heat themselves with

159
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:01,860
love not often it so we're coming to the

160
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:04,649
we're now going to specific discussions

161
00:09:04,649 --> 00:09:07,889
now so I'm also gonna air a little bit

162
00:09:07,889 --> 00:09:11,459
about Microsoft's I know I Ithaca by

163
00:09:11,459 --> 00:09:13,980
possibly so i'll talk about a security

164
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:16,579
feature buying the bypass vulnerability

165
00:09:16,579 --> 00:09:19,410
pallets lift i was the stuff of you know

166
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:22,019
I'll bring this nor does what actually

167
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:24,439
happened here and I'm kind of again

168
00:09:24,439 --> 00:09:26,910
musica Alicia no order as opening to

169
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:29,610
cliff khuddam system had limitless tight

170
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:33,480
hot diggity it takes up to so an

171
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,879
attacker that has physical access to a

172
00:09:35,879 --> 00:09:39,600
system could violate the integrity of

173
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,559
the system and could deactivate secure

174
00:09:43,559 --> 00:09:48,180
boot prevent the validity check-in

175
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:50,759
BitLocker and could disallow device

176
00:09:50,759 --> 00:09:53,660
encryption security features so

177
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:58,670
basically everything if i'm not mistaken

178
00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:01,980
this was blacklisted but there are still

179
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:05,430
problems creeping up for now i just want

180
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:07,860
to point to that once that there are

181
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:12,360
companies that built closed systems with

182
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:18,540
mistakes that we're one tiny packet of

183
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:21,449
data i can prevent the security

184
00:10:21,449 --> 00:10:24,389
architecture from working at all because

185
00:10:24,389 --> 00:10:30,649
of that i want to say that we need to

186
00:10:30,649 --> 00:10:33,410
because for example of trusted computing

187
00:10:33,410 --> 00:10:36,389
architecture builds on 2048 bits of key

188
00:10:36,389 --> 00:10:40,199
length which is not enough for long lift

189
00:10:40,199 --> 00:10:45,420
security so we need alternatives so i

190
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:49,230
made the last recommendation so a

191
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:51,089
microsoft reactive fairly cleverly do

192
00:10:51,089 --> 00:10:55,170
this so in previous discussions I've

193
00:10:55,170 --> 00:11:00,480
really discussed about this mom so if

194
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,000
the Microsoft saves the data in the US

195
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,519
mainland one hat either fun feeling

196
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:06,410
belly

197
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:08,970
oakley come at me the deutsche telekom

198
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:11,160
nadal cloud fifa and so they've they'd

199
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:13,200
realize that was acceptable and so they

200
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:17,820
made a cloud in Germany but that

201
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:20,310
unfortunately has not does not been

202
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:23,310
successful to this point this was a a

203
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:26,640
recommendation from the CEO micro of

204
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:30,270
Microsoft or third plan my thief I

205
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:33,360
double so he knew they needed a massive

206
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,820
data center in eastern Germany I kept

207
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,860
acknowledge the attacker identity / f

208
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:40,770
around xanga in the system to bring but

209
00:11:40,770 --> 00:11:44,010
I moved in with their p.m. and sadly his

210
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:49,200
gaining height I'm not out to buy these

211
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,640
alternative trust anchors should be a

212
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:54,660
possibility for companies to do not have

213
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:57,300
to trust traditional CIS and not have to

214
00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:00,690
trust the government and i think is a

215
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:04,860
very interesting point we have made some

216
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:10,800
good experiences with trusts like for

217
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:17,940
example i can jumping into technology we

218
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:20,310
have technologies that we can share

219
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:24,089
trust we have zero knowledge things we

220
00:12:24,089 --> 00:12:26,220
have secret sharing things those are not

221
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:29,580
just academic proposals for example this

222
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:32,940
is being done in practice for the DNS

223
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:38,040
root key for in the fun ceremonies but

224
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:41,339
it is working we've less cryptographers

225
00:12:41,339 --> 00:12:45,830
can invent and can pointed technologies

226
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:49,279
that you can use for such applications

227
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:55,589
coming to a creepy and quiz Eric Schmidt

228
00:12:55,589 --> 00:12:58,140
in 2011 explained they built a

229
00:12:58,140 --> 00:13:02,430
technology is very fantastic but it's

230
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:04,680
only technology that Google ever

231
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:08,940
produced and said it's too creepy we

232
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:11,850
were not going to use it you do you have

233
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:18,070
an idea what that could be silence

234
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:20,890
the audience yeah yeah I only talk on I

235
00:13:20,890 --> 00:13:22,600
am I also wouldn't have known that the

236
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:25,330
d40 natural Lincoln was but in bigger

237
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:27,790
versatile to live on Jesus tonight of a

238
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:31,510
lieutenant this is what they booked me

239
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:35,530
say but I know a little out there whoops

240
00:13:35,530 --> 00:13:40,080
bully now or not an answer idea here

241
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:42,970
McKinney ihop if I'm reading that I was

242
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:46,480
a weirded out as a technology that works

243
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,340
great and Google isn't using it cuz it

244
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:50,830
creeps them out and what the subject is

245
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,780
facial recognition and Google considers

246
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:56,830
that are creepy because Google for

247
00:13:56,830 --> 00:14:00,790
example the government can film protests

248
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:05,890
where people are filmed and are

249
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:08,140
recognized or festivals at the entrance

250
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:09,520
your filmed and your face is a

251
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:12,790
recognition recognized in HD such

252
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:16,840
technologies that can now be used by

253
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:20,560
secret services will later be used in a

254
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,110
year by hackers and a couple years later

255
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:26,530
bye normal the normal populace in a

256
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:29,740
Russian art project for example a

257
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:31,930
Russian artist thought well we can

258
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:36,070
recognize any person so what happened on

259
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:40,080
the internet is on to Chan people took

260
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:43,900
pornographic movies and sex worker pages

261
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:47,830
and stalked and the an anonymized people

262
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:51,970
on these pages and that was a violation

263
00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:55,930
of their privacy this is a danger for

264
00:14:55,930 --> 00:14:58,840
for example homosexual demonstrations

265
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:03,430
for normal protests and that is a

266
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:05,470
technology where you just have to sit

267
00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:09,670
down and you will realize that it's it

268
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:12,190
is creepy and if you look at the current

269
00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:16,779
development and I'd like to point to

270
00:15:16,779 --> 00:15:20,029
brilliant charge go by Anna Buzzelli who

271
00:15:20,029 --> 00:15:24,350
pointed out for example for transsexual

272
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:29,679
sex workers anonymity can be life-saving

273
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:37,189
its participation in sex work can be met

274
00:15:37,189 --> 00:15:40,339
by by draconian punishments and that in

275
00:15:40,339 --> 00:15:42,649
a transsexual context can be even more

276
00:15:42,649 --> 00:15:46,749
dangerous and punished even worse and

277
00:15:46,749 --> 00:15:51,619
yeah because of that we've come to one

278
00:15:51,619 --> 00:15:57,970
clear position I I don't want to go into

279
00:15:57,970 --> 00:16:00,619
a political discussion that'll go

280
00:16:00,619 --> 00:16:04,449
nowhere but if we want to protect people

281
00:16:04,449 --> 00:16:07,069
don't you might be deaf a looong game

282
00:16:07,069 --> 00:16:09,110
then we we have to understand that we

283
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:12,619
will always lose databases that even

284
00:16:12,619 --> 00:16:14,989
with rules about this we will always

285
00:16:14,989 --> 00:16:17,269
lose databases and because of this

286
00:16:17,269 --> 00:16:25,040
applause because of this we have to

287
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:32,809
think like hackers so if the data could

288
00:16:32,809 --> 00:16:34,519
be lost in people's lives for the rest

289
00:16:34,519 --> 00:16:37,600
then we can't store it we can't save it

290
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:41,860
we are ones not nice pasanda the

291
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:44,509
Hockomock here clash to heaven him about

292
00:16:44,509 --> 00:16:46,790
once but at least it is from amazon

293
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:49,129
these are was a listen or as a car buy

294
00:16:49,129 --> 00:16:50,720
three gifts that you brings lets the

295
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,249
mountain then that's an alcatel is most

296
00:16:52,249 --> 00:16:53,839
relevant ones of my own murphy life

297
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:57,439
could have been creating guns inland and

298
00:16:57,439 --> 00:17:01,009
we all exist gentlemen Shido is such

299
00:17:01,009 --> 00:17:03,379
technologies can endanger really living

300
00:17:03,379 --> 00:17:07,459
real persons and they can endanger

301
00:17:07,459 --> 00:17:10,549
anonymity we could potentially help

302
00:17:10,549 --> 00:17:12,429
there we could say there are an

303
00:17:12,429 --> 00:17:15,589
intimidation methods to anonymize people

304
00:17:15,589 --> 00:17:19,369
and many people go somewhere where they

305
00:17:19,369 --> 00:17:23,720
get an official document certifying

306
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:26,329
something and the people might the

307
00:17:26,329 --> 00:17:28,449
people issuing that might not know

308
00:17:28,449 --> 00:17:32,940
they've issued that certification to

309
00:17:33,809 --> 00:17:37,210
also there's the point to disallow the I

310
00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:42,070
was mightily to do to Java the personal

311
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:44,220
identifying document they are

312
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:50,380
pseudonymous at that point and basically

313
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:53,620
a the counter measures proposed were

314
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:56,169
that you should not upload pictures to

315
00:17:56,169 --> 00:17:58,120
social media but there are other people

316
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:00,309
uploading your pictures to social media

317
00:18:00,309 --> 00:18:04,600
so anonymous identifying documents with

318
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:07,179
a picture are not anonymous anymore and

319
00:18:07,179 --> 00:18:09,669
we have to figure that out there's also

320
00:18:09,669 --> 00:18:13,419
another recommendation if masses of data

321
00:18:13,419 --> 00:18:16,179
are collected and that's problematic

322
00:18:16,179 --> 00:18:23,830
because if people cannot be advised

323
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:27,159
enough by the cords and the system but

324
00:18:27,159 --> 00:18:32,130
there would be technologies for example

325
00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:34,929
differential privacy that could help

326
00:18:34,929 --> 00:18:36,730
with that that's a technology that helps

327
00:18:36,730 --> 00:18:39,700
gathering statistical data and still

328
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:42,149
maintain some sort of protection for

329
00:18:42,149 --> 00:18:46,330
privacy there's work of sync at work of

330
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:50,190
Microsoft and it's a very powerful

331
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:53,620
concept it's a very very beautiful

332
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:56,019
mathematics not as complicated as a

333
00:18:56,019 --> 00:19:00,639
number theory and we will provide

334
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:03,880
concrete parameters in your study that

335
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,559
we recommend for use with differential

336
00:19:05,559 --> 00:19:10,480
privacy we also point to whomever using

337
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:13,539
differential privacy whoever uses a

338
00:19:13,539 --> 00:19:18,100
process personal data should do well to

339
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:21,070
use differential privacy and we just

340
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:22,269
have to give it a big shout out to

341
00:19:22,269 --> 00:19:24,100
Microsoft they have done excellent work

342
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:26,679
it's ten years past now and the match is

343
00:19:26,679 --> 00:19:31,929
so powerful but not so far away from

344
00:19:31,929 --> 00:19:36,159
normal maps it's not it's not mass in

345
00:19:36,159 --> 00:19:38,260
development no research mathis it's it

346
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:39,990
we can really we

347
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:41,670
and that and we would give

348
00:19:41,670 --> 00:19:43,380
recommendations in our study towards

349
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:45,750
using differential privacy finally

350
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:49,020
moving to the positive things what can

351
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:51,900
we do with cryptography where else can

352
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:56,010
we do with cryptography anonymous

353
00:19:56,010 --> 00:19:58,290
attestation is a combination of blind

354
00:19:58,290 --> 00:19:59,790
signatures and zero knowledge

355
00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:02,520
technologies if we can combine these two

356
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:05,550
and I'll come to that later in trusted

357
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:08,429
computing we can guarantee that a system

358
00:20:08,429 --> 00:20:11,600
has some security properties without

359
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,690
giving away the identity of the system a

360
00:20:14,690 --> 00:20:17,370
blind signatures explaining that again

361
00:20:17,370 --> 00:20:22,380
the magic is that Alice can encrypt a

362
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:26,100
document to Bob to design it Bob signs

363
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:31,170
the encrypted version with the and with

364
00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:35,840
additional knowledge Alice can create a

365
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:38,940
signature for the unencrypted version

366
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:42,000
with some extra knowledge from the

367
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:47,130
signature to the encrypted version and

368
00:20:47,130 --> 00:20:50,580
in that case Bob who created the

369
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:56,309
signature cannot term in which document

370
00:20:56,309 --> 00:21:00,300
it was and for whom it was signed a

371
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:03,450
little odd I worked with one of my

372
00:21:03,450 --> 00:21:05,880
master's students on blind ECC

373
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:09,150
signatures for elliptic curves for

374
00:21:09,150 --> 00:21:13,190
openpgp and he proposed a very nice hack

375
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:16,290
working out into open PGP the talk

376
00:21:16,290 --> 00:21:20,000
wasn't accepted unfortunately to this

377
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,970
Congress as I just had to sneak that in

378
00:21:23,970 --> 00:21:26,210
[Applause]

379
00:21:26,210 --> 00:21:28,830
it was on the open tech conference and

380
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:32,880
you can if you're interested you can

381
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:38,130
check out the the source code and we are

382
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:41,610
of course open for comments for feedback

383
00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:44,700
and I I have critical comments on

384
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:46,110
elliptic curves but there are some

385
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:48,750
scenarios where they can be used pretty

386
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:51,660
well zero knowledge protocols

387
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:54,960
touching upon them briefly are the idea

388
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,790
that we can prove that we have some

389
00:21:56,790 --> 00:21:59,100
knowledge without giving that knowledge

390
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:02,700
away I I forgot pointing to the dates

391
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:04,710
blind signatures was nineteen eighty-two

392
00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:08,310
they were patented but these patents

393
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:12,930
have expired by now so please do have a

394
00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:14,880
look at this blind signatures 82 and

395
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:17,490
zero knowledge 83 and can now be used

396
00:22:17,490 --> 00:22:21,660
without regardless of the patents

397
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:25,200
because they have expired now trusted

398
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:28,520
computing direct anonymous attestation

399
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:32,220
there's an analysis of Stephanie me from

400
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:36,240
I think 2004 there are some farther

401
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:41,370
developments another pointer to blind

402
00:22:41,370 --> 00:22:43,830
signatures identity management there are

403
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:46,320
great works by Stefan brands at

404
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:49,460
Microsoft do you have a look at that

405
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:53,610
it's maths that allows us to protect

406
00:22:53,610 --> 00:22:56,670
people and that's a thing where I invite

407
00:22:56,670 --> 00:23:01,170
people to try and have a look at the

408
00:23:01,170 --> 00:23:05,150
mass the mass is pretty oh

409
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:08,670
understandable and you can really make a

410
00:23:08,670 --> 00:23:10,650
change and improve on the world the

411
00:23:10,650 --> 00:23:13,620
final two slides I'm a great fan of hash

412
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:18,140
functions last year we had this great

413
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:22,380
talk by DJ B and Tanya Langer about post

414
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:25,350
quantum cryptography and what I took

415
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:27,270
away from that is what I really

416
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:30,570
understood our Merkley signatures based

417
00:23:30,570 --> 00:23:33,090
on hash functions and that is

418
00:23:33,090 --> 00:23:37,320
fascinating that these are even safe

419
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:39,300
against quantum computing quantum

420
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:43,320
attacks also we can take some ideas from

421
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:45,180
Bitcoin and the blog changes to drop

422
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:50,250
that buzz word and we can use these hash

423
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:52,890
functions as a building block we have

424
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:57,000
understood that even though we have to

425
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:01,139
use some quite weak assumptions

426
00:24:01,139 --> 00:24:04,960
so yeah the the collision freedom of

427
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:08,710
hashes are a valid valuable point for us

428
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:12,460
and the the good points but bitcoin is

429
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:15,309
the people are good cryptographers and

430
00:24:15,309 --> 00:24:18,940
they they know that they do not know

431
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:23,409
anything and they often use they often

432
00:24:23,409 --> 00:24:24,879
do stuff twice or they hash and hash

433
00:24:24,879 --> 00:24:27,700
again which is basically Russian space

434
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:32,049
engineering it's not just ekta before me

435
00:24:32,049 --> 00:24:34,600
they're saying that they just they know

436
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,129
where the weak points are today they do

437
00:24:36,129 --> 00:24:40,000
it twice for more security and that way

438
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,639
they don't have to explain why they do

439
00:24:42,639 --> 00:24:45,220
stuff so instead they just add some more

440
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:48,909
layers and as good a good thing finally

441
00:24:48,909 --> 00:24:53,200
this shirt slide this is a slight that I

442
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,509
told pretty massively to the ministry

443
00:24:55,509 --> 00:25:00,909
and we have some software that is

444
00:25:00,909 --> 00:25:03,940
relevant to systems so if software

445
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:07,240
breaks we are in trouble and that is for

446
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:12,039
one truecrypt in vero crypt I want to

447
00:25:12,039 --> 00:25:14,889
speak about PGP that's not that nice

448
00:25:14,889 --> 00:25:16,960
tool which way with which you can sign

449
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:20,830
things on that the entire update

450
00:25:20,830 --> 00:25:24,700
management in Linux is built and if we

451
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:29,220
realize that in Linux has completely

452
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:32,320
complete control of the operating system

453
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:36,279
market that we realize that this is

454
00:25:36,279 --> 00:25:38,679
really important because if that breaks

455
00:25:38,679 --> 00:25:41,500
away then the whole world cannot cannot

456
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:44,950
run update securely anymore finally

457
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:48,700
before I give the word folica who will

458
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:51,039
speak about scoring which is a very

459
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:55,059
interesting thing again i want to point

460
00:25:55,059 --> 00:25:58,409
to the words of edward snowden

461
00:25:58,409 --> 00:26:02,769
cryptography contains maths but it's not

462
00:26:02,769 --> 00:26:07,149
black magic it's things we understood

463
00:26:07,149 --> 00:26:10,269
things we have discussed we do not have

464
00:26:10,269 --> 00:26:13,299
all of the maths behind it and even I

465
00:26:13,299 --> 00:26:14,110
after 30

466
00:26:14,110 --> 00:26:15,790
years of studying it do not understand

467
00:26:15,790 --> 00:26:19,240
all of it but we need to see what

468
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:23,679
possibilities there are and politicians

469
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:25,900
cannot guarantee any more that we're not

470
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:29,500
being listened to but if we use end to

471
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:33,960
end encryption then we're not that

472
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:36,400
vulnerable to dragnet surveillance but

473
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:39,760
they will have to attack each every

474
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:44,470
single one of us independently and that

475
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:47,220
being said encryption as the standard

476
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:49,540
400 mode of communication for everything

477
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:53,260
is what we need to do and i repeat the

478
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:55,510
invitation to academics we need to

479
00:26:55,510 --> 00:26:57,820
implement it and we need to actively

480
00:26:57,820 --> 00:27:00,820
research it and for all the people who

481
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:05,400
see social problems related to

482
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:11,049
distributed trust related to confirming

483
00:27:11,049 --> 00:27:14,290
things without touching upon the privacy

484
00:27:14,290 --> 00:27:17,429
of the subject who's aspects you confirm

485
00:27:17,429 --> 00:27:21,190
there are a lot of things going on in

486
00:27:21,190 --> 00:27:22,750
there and there's a lot of room for

487
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:26,429
improvement so please participate

488
00:27:26,429 --> 00:27:39,070
applause so i'm going to try and get

489
00:27:39,070 --> 00:27:49,960
through my talk quickly no clapping so

490
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:51,100
it's supposed to be 20 minutes of her

491
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:53,080
scoring but we don't quite have 20

492
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:54,429
minutes I imagine is going to be a lot

493
00:27:54,429 --> 00:27:59,049
of discussions after rudy's talk so they

494
00:27:59,049 --> 00:28:02,230
i'd recommend the the scoring

495
00:28:02,230 --> 00:28:04,210
presentation i'll be doing in the the

496
00:28:04,210 --> 00:28:09,490
third of january cryptic presentation in

497
00:28:09,490 --> 00:28:13,840
berlin and he's now I'm asking what does

498
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:15,040
the stage manager think should we go

499
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:20,320
right to questions and answers we

500
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,150
actually have time I don't know why you

501
00:28:22,150 --> 00:28:25,630
want to do it missing it's an issue burn

502
00:28:25,630 --> 00:28:26,230
a hybrid

503
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:28,360
q and Emma we don't need to make a half

504
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:30,730
hour of QA we have a we have a 20

505
00:28:30,730 --> 00:28:34,470
minutes we have a half already go still

506
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:39,418
so I think we only have 15 minute left

507
00:28:42,510 --> 00:28:44,650
so one of us is going to start with this

508
00:28:44,650 --> 00:28:51,400
either him or me sorry sorry for the

509
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:53,590
horrible start okay now we're going well

510
00:28:53,590 --> 00:28:56,080
masked man I Nadia's miss Franklin so

511
00:28:56,080 --> 00:29:01,059
for my nine Eschete nice this is this

512
00:29:01,059 --> 00:29:02,770
isn't about getting tips for the party

513
00:29:02,770 --> 00:29:09,490
tonight this is about statistics so must

514
00:29:09,490 --> 00:29:16,090
go to where we are right now physical

515
00:29:16,090 --> 00:29:19,570
risk sets on me opposition's and eats

516
00:29:19,570 --> 00:29:23,380
and conf are young but to minimize them

517
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:24,760
and control them as one of the key

518
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:29,559
things of the current economy so we need

519
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:32,679
to think about the future possibilities

520
00:29:32,679 --> 00:29:34,330
here predictions are difficult

521
00:29:34,330 --> 00:29:36,970
particularly from when we try it when

522
00:29:36,970 --> 00:29:40,390
they meet the future Kumiko encrypted oh

523
00:29:40,390 --> 00:29:44,860
I music are so someone either a of

524
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:46,900
whether author physicists wrote this

525
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:52,000
mark Mark Twain or Neil Boris I think we

526
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:56,350
want to talk about how to make the use

527
00:29:56,350 --> 00:29:59,110
the the information in the past about to

528
00:29:59,110 --> 00:30:02,860
more easily to predict the future this

529
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:04,809
is Optimus prodigy like Miss could equal

530
00:30:04,809 --> 00:30:07,150
Tom what a physician was fine so we know

531
00:30:07,150 --> 00:30:10,000
that that things like credit scores and

532
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,750
and insurance scores are useful to

533
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:16,030
predict the future uses a diagnosis on

534
00:30:16,030 --> 00:30:18,790
I'm Tiffany Ashley's in this because of

535
00:30:18,790 --> 00:30:21,370
kindness weeks viviana but it's not an

536
00:30:21,370 --> 00:30:23,500
easy thing to do to decide whether this

537
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:24,850
is what you can make decisions based on

538
00:30:24,850 --> 00:30:28,990
that so using large data from previous

539
00:30:28,990 --> 00:30:35,590
things previously avenged so I've used

540
00:30:35,590 --> 00:30:37,770
regression atlanta licenses just

541
00:30:37,770 --> 00:30:41,430
for fury for various grades to to see

542
00:30:41,430 --> 00:30:43,200
whether I could correlate accurately

543
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,660
correlate all data with with what

544
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:53,430
actually happens in the future so I want

545
00:30:53,430 --> 00:30:56,490
to see if i could easily prove what was

546
00:30:56,490 --> 00:30:59,820
both whether an old old data and data

547
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:02,100
model is what actually worked the

548
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:04,200
cunning in a hard League nuh nuh

549
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:07,470
nuh start a fish made an equation by

550
00:31:07,470 --> 00:31:12,330
Damon East does that mode air is it

551
00:31:12,330 --> 00:31:14,640
trying to find out not just whether

552
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,950
whether whether it was accurate but how

553
00:31:16,950 --> 00:31:23,010
accurate was and how effective it was so

554
00:31:23,010 --> 00:31:25,140
trying to find out if the you could make

555
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:28,020
the decision about it or an individual

556
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:30,780
based on unde atta how accurate was that

557
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:33,630
and can we make a risk course on a risk

558
00:31:33,630 --> 00:31:36,930
score based on that to allow someone to

559
00:31:36,930 --> 00:31:39,060
make a decision whether whether we

560
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:40,440
should take a risk with this person and

561
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,390
how much how much do we need to take

562
00:31:42,390 --> 00:31:44,820
effort do we take to ensure it so

563
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:48,830
normally some of the some of these

564
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:51,240
calculation methods are unknown but this

565
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:54,060
is an example from a firm to describe a

566
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:57,480
score counter in the US so if someone

567
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:02,400
had a a a check on us a savings account

568
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:05,520
to become you become 39 points or 31

569
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:08,570
points for both and your age is a factor

570
00:32:08,570 --> 00:32:11,970
and your son tova is it you can connect

571
00:32:11,970 --> 00:32:13,920
us in school how it's going on yes I

572
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:18,110
coupon thief is finalized issues yeah

573
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:23,610
I'm Venice further fun scoring um your

574
00:32:23,610 --> 00:32:27,720
mushroom so some of the examples of the

575
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:31,920
different mechanisms places that you

576
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:35,810
that uses information for make decisions

577
00:32:35,810 --> 00:32:39,180
so example predictive policing use it as

578
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:47,070
well stories equal um the risks of a tax

579
00:32:47,070 --> 00:32:48,809
violations

580
00:32:48,809 --> 00:32:53,419
Tom interested in China they use a

581
00:32:53,419 --> 00:32:57,870
social social credit system since that

582
00:32:57,870 --> 00:32:59,759
they that is going to be required by

583
00:32:59,759 --> 00:33:04,590
2020 to do that that also is related to

584
00:33:04,590 --> 00:33:07,259
insurance and keep a zone and vaga but

585
00:33:07,259 --> 00:33:09,269
in its right note that is noise in your

586
00:33:09,269 --> 00:33:11,039
wholeness honestly is messin toy

587
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:13,320
instrumented us for course so the info

588
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:18,419
vendor food though so wait since

589
00:33:18,419 --> 00:33:20,309
eighteen sixty was has been used as a

590
00:33:20,309 --> 00:33:26,639
mechanism to to to measure the risk and

591
00:33:26,639 --> 00:33:33,059
in 2004 there were four authors coming

592
00:33:33,059 --> 00:33:35,279
from the recycle mountain they used

593
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:36,929
three different I'm sorry they're

594
00:33:36,929 --> 00:33:38,909
focused in holly gets the unplug woman

595
00:33:38,909 --> 00:33:41,429
ina unfastened r is equal three

596
00:33:41,429 --> 00:33:45,139
different mechanisms to measure a

597
00:33:45,139 --> 00:33:48,570
traffic risk vital if not Molly him

598
00:33:48,570 --> 00:33:51,059
super Commons in material even and

599
00:33:51,059 --> 00:33:53,460
watching physicians Marcus mitad del Sol

600
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:56,279
an annoying cigar so get this too much

601
00:33:56,279 --> 00:33:59,879
of a battle fewer Nova Vinny for example

602
00:33:59,879 --> 00:34:02,399
in traffic there rebates for for people

603
00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:04,049
with new cars for people who drive

604
00:34:04,049 --> 00:34:07,740
little for people who complete the

605
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:10,500
security tray and safety training on the

606
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:13,710
other hand there are I don't charges for

607
00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:16,980
old cars old people or cars that are

608
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:18,889
being used in Eastern European countries

609
00:34:18,889 --> 00:34:23,449
but the study shows that only few of

610
00:34:23,449 --> 00:34:27,629
these aspects are value are irrelevant

611
00:34:27,629 --> 00:34:31,770
predictors since the 19th century lots

612
00:34:31,770 --> 00:34:34,139
of things have changed things didn't

613
00:34:34,139 --> 00:34:37,010
have IP back then now we have a

614
00:34:37,010 --> 00:34:39,329
computational devices with us at any

615
00:34:39,329 --> 00:34:41,040
time with lots and lots of sensors and

616
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:45,030
more and more being added as as i speak

617
00:34:45,030 --> 00:34:51,960
basically medium social media know who

618
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:54,239
all social media we share lots of data

619
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:56,790
freely now and then we have big data

620
00:34:56,790 --> 00:35:00,600
cyber and the cloud to sharing more data

621
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:04,410
because we can scoring from all of the

622
00:35:04,410 --> 00:35:06,900
data we leave behind is being used for

623
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:12,420
scoring the change in mentality helps in

624
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:15,750
the 80s there were movements against

625
00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:19,590
population counting's and stuff censuses

626
00:35:19,590 --> 00:35:22,920
and now there are blocks for post

627
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:26,220
privacy and things like that and here's

628
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:29,280
a quantified self for example where we

629
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:33,900
see the scale again you're on okay to

630
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:36,930
splash cure one concrete example for a

631
00:35:36,930 --> 00:35:39,900
car insurance that's called bonus drive

632
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:43,980
by aliens it's targeted to young people

633
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:48,350
people who do not yet have a credit or

634
00:35:48,350 --> 00:35:52,830
insurance history and they agree to have

635
00:35:52,830 --> 00:35:55,880
their driving behavior measured and

636
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:58,620
receive an exchange rebates up to forty

637
00:35:58,620 --> 00:36:03,000
percent here we see the data streams

638
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:07,730
that a car equipped with a will publish

639
00:36:07,730 --> 00:36:13,320
the octo telematics for example bills

640
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:16,080
and runs these systems for more than

641
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:18,120
sixty insurance companies in 23

642
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:23,130
countries amongst them alliums they add

643
00:36:23,130 --> 00:36:25,110
a black box to the cart with

644
00:36:25,110 --> 00:36:27,810
acceleration says sensors a sim card and

645
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:33,120
so on and this B sensors the track Gio

646
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:38,570
tight Direction breaking turns crashes

647
00:36:38,570 --> 00:36:42,690
curation and distance of a drive and

648
00:36:42,690 --> 00:36:47,400
transmit that to octo in addition a lot

649
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:50,730
of other things are promised for example

650
00:36:50,730 --> 00:36:54,930
a stolen car can be easily found sample

651
00:36:54,930 --> 00:36:58,050
and the health fund generally for his

652
00:36:58,050 --> 00:37:01,290
equally so in generally had used a very

653
00:37:01,290 --> 00:37:06,510
health and life insurance you know this

654
00:37:06,510 --> 00:37:09,120
is what's important here also this

655
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:11,790
feedback Venetian were on the physicians

656
00:37:11,790 --> 00:37:14,030
on the name the feedback isn't also

657
00:37:14,030 --> 00:37:17,240
given to the the corporation also to the

658
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:20,060
individuals and that will that way they

659
00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:21,350
can actually set goals for themselves

660
00:37:21,350 --> 00:37:23,690
for health and use the tracker to see

661
00:37:23,690 --> 00:37:25,940
how they're approaching that approaching

662
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:28,340
the goals it's not just about a

663
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:32,920
measurement but it's also about a

664
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:35,780
taxation of the measurements so game if

665
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:37,880
gamification is a strategy for this for

666
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:43,280
example demotic for the shape our Casa

667
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:51,860
bank in Germany had started a a driver

668
00:37:51,860 --> 00:37:56,900
of the month and the customers were

669
00:37:56,900 --> 00:38:00,200
largely happy with it and it'll cost

670
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:05,240
about a hundred dollars per month isn't

671
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:07,730
the matzah and got involved in being on

672
00:38:07,730 --> 00:38:10,340
an da boom din high score de semana so

673
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:13,130
people then competed to attempt to to

674
00:38:13,130 --> 00:38:16,610
reach the high score of the month posts

675
00:38:16,610 --> 00:38:19,490
of event Indian pisano physician so that

676
00:38:19,490 --> 00:38:25,100
a new trend is to use a Facebook post to

677
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:28,160
attempt to to get a to improve the

678
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:32,480
purchase of a car so so this is a idea

679
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:39,790
to to get an offer from a 44 insurance

680
00:38:39,790 --> 00:38:42,440
you to do this you'd give the Admiral

681
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:45,920
access to your Facebook account and then

682
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:51,320
they the Admiral would use the your your

683
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:53,750
history and look at it and attempted to

684
00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:56,870
find out this the person was was well

685
00:38:56,870 --> 00:38:59,030
organized and thoughtful you for the new

686
00:38:59,030 --> 00:39:01,400
phone listen for operator limit point so

687
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:04,340
concrete inside with odds and garden

688
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:07,910
using locations and in other mechanisms

689
00:39:07,910 --> 00:39:11,170
to determine whether someone was

690
00:39:11,170 --> 00:39:15,890
eligible not feel like answering for I

691
00:39:15,890 --> 00:39:19,640
to go save / I'd and also using it to

692
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:21,890
measure their they're built the DS are

693
00:39:21,890 --> 00:39:23,540
their character data to help them

694
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:25,910
understand about whether you could come

695
00:39:25,910 --> 00:39:26,990
up with a risk in that

696
00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:29,270
similar to face stop is Underwood's good

697
00:39:29,270 --> 00:39:31,880
plan they attempted to start this in

698
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:36,530
November but Facebook poll pulled their

699
00:39:36,530 --> 00:39:39,380
of their ability to do this they

700
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:42,080
wouldn't reach Facebook yeah they

701
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:44,420
wouldn't give Admiral access to the data

702
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:46,160
despite that actually that they'd

703
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:47,510
already tested this with Admiral for

704
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:50,750
several months so I'll talk a little bit

705
00:39:50,750 --> 00:39:54,740
about the reason for that I'm instead of

706
00:39:54,740 --> 00:39:59,930
that Admirals done a small survey name

707
00:39:59,930 --> 00:40:02,300
butts also again using the facebook

708
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:04,520
login from telematic physician which

709
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:07,250
dates work lighted fun I never to look

710
00:40:07,250 --> 00:40:11,060
for objectivity so the reason for it was

711
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:14,860
based on of objectivity in fairness

712
00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:17,119
because they felt like there couldn't be

713
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:18,619
a correlation between the Facebook

714
00:40:18,619 --> 00:40:21,530
information and the and the decision to

715
00:40:21,530 --> 00:40:27,170
offer a a a insurance quote funda

716
00:40:27,170 --> 00:40:29,690
academia I'm is a stone yo step s of

717
00:40:29,690 --> 00:40:32,170
McAuliffe on generali issue few when the

718
00:40:32,170 --> 00:40:34,100
recognized on the scene with other

719
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:35,480
things nice to go and so they didn't

720
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:37,600
bleed didn't believe that i had a a

721
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:42,440
academic or a tested mechanism for doing

722
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:47,810
this i supposed to schufa which is the

723
00:40:47,810 --> 00:40:50,840
german mechanism for measuring for

724
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:54,710
credit scores which is in theory free

725
00:40:54,710 --> 00:40:56,420
from subjectivity farm from cambridge

726
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:59,060
analytica by black suit and from angle

727
00:40:59,060 --> 00:41:01,700
so how did you wind amake osbon and so

728
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:04,970
this is a discrimination chart that

729
00:41:04,970 --> 00:41:09,160
attempted to measure the f different

730
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:11,690
attributes and how it how it tied the

731

00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:27,710
whether they were what your attitudes

00:41:27,710 --> 00:41:29,330
were based on what you need actually

select it in facebook or like done

738

Facebook this is up night fairness

fairness vote for vented fog all harder

740
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:46,090
for two shoots and also the scoring was

741
00:41:46,090 --> 00:41:52,580
was designed to protect users from for

742
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:57,320
being a fairly keep needlessly a charge

743
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:59,690
for things when we couldn't invited you

744
00:41:59,690 --> 00:42:04,190
here I guns Vista kazhagam an important

745
00:42:04,190 --> 00:42:07,190
argument can see five and under was

746
00:42:07,190 --> 00:42:09,650
Mitch was confident when some people

747
00:42:09,650 --> 00:42:11,660
found this risky and some people didn't

748
00:42:11,660 --> 00:42:13,940
yes the run clear attention you know

749
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:18,380
doesn't feel and we don't want to have

750
00:42:18,380 --> 00:42:22,220
the the people who behave risky no the

751
00:42:22,220 --> 00:42:24,109
people who don't behave risky basically

752
00:42:24,109 --> 00:42:26,750
pay the ones who do behave risky so that

753
00:42:26,750 --> 00:42:28,760
would be a punishment for the ones

754
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:33,920
behaving less risky which is the

755
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:39,490
argument should be prevented so yeah

756
00:42:39,490 --> 00:42:42,140
punishment payments for some groups are

757
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:46,609
basically forbidden moving on to data

758
00:42:46,609 --> 00:42:53,450
economy and data economy is one of the

759
00:42:53,450 --> 00:42:57,710
the basic principles of privacy and the

760
00:42:57,710 --> 00:43:02,240
the more data we have the more precise

761
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:03,890
scoring can be done see scoring is

762
00:43:03,890 --> 00:43:05,599
basically the exact opposite of data

763
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:09,190
economy also the being bound to a

764
00:43:09,190 --> 00:43:15,380
purpose of data is lost because the data

765
00:43:15,380 --> 00:43:17,390
and social networks is not being

766
00:43:17,390 --> 00:43:19,940
generated for input to scoring algorithm

767
00:43:19,940 --> 00:43:23,570
or offer price determination but they

768
00:43:23,570 --> 00:43:25,550
are used for social networking but

769
00:43:25,550 --> 00:43:28,880
because data is the oil of the 21st

770
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:32,980
century we see this reuse because

771
00:43:32,980 --> 00:43:37,310
everyone is asking for data richness and

772
00:43:37,310 --> 00:43:41,210
data use instead of data protection this

773
00:43:41,210 --> 00:43:44,140
rhetoric of data protection as

774
00:43:44,140 --> 00:43:49,010
innovation hindrance needs to be removed

775
00:43:49,010 --> 00:43:51,770
and we need to have a clear commitment

776
00:43:51,770 --> 00:43:56,030
to privacy and to the protection of

777
00:43:56,030 --> 00:43:57,860
basic right of the basic right of

778
00:43:57,860 --> 00:44:01,660
privacy in the net we need to negotiate

779
00:44:01,660 --> 00:44:04,070
borders for example the facebook

780
00:44:04,070 --> 00:44:10,400
platform policy has prevented Admiral or

781
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:11,900
Facebook has prevented Admiral from

782
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:15,560
reading data for that insurance pointing

783
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:17,570
to that platform policy because of the

784
00:44:17,570 --> 00:44:19,880
data obtained from Facebook must not be

785
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:22,000
used to make decisions about eligibility

786
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,290
including whether or not to approve or

787
00:44:24,290 --> 00:44:28,880
reject applications the probable

788
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:30,980
background of this is not that Facebook

789
00:44:30,980 --> 00:44:32,590
has certainly become conscious of

790
00:44:32,590 --> 00:44:34,970
privacy conscious but because they

791
00:44:34,970 --> 00:44:38,410
probably want to use that for themselves

792
00:44:38,410 --> 00:44:42,620
and there are implications on free

793
00:44:42,620 --> 00:44:48,740
speech bordering on undying opt-in isn't

794
00:44:48,740 --> 00:44:52,820
often being called as a basic principle

795
00:44:52,820 --> 00:44:57,230
of data protection here is a cookie

796
00:44:57,230 --> 00:45:00,230
banner that is visible on basically any

797
00:45:00,230 --> 00:45:06,680
site often you see such banners where it

798
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:09,380
is you can either accept to use cookies

799
00:45:09,380 --> 00:45:11,360
because the company was forced to place

800
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:12,650
that banner here or you can leave this

801
00:45:12,650 --> 00:45:15,260
site well we want a lot there is no

802
00:45:15,260 --> 00:45:17,270
finish the note when you go for all set

803
00:45:17,270 --> 00:45:18,830
some others easily can I should be

804
00:45:18,830 --> 00:45:22,240
visible afgan is powerful but it's not

805
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:26,330
it's not a perfect solution on only

806
00:45:26,330 --> 00:45:29,120
about thirty percent guys got signed us

807
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:33,350
privacy by design and so Marsh boys

808
00:45:33,350 --> 00:45:35,630
differential privacy if it is fun greedy

809
00:45:35,630 --> 00:45:39,470
for in good so even if date is

810
00:45:39,470 --> 00:45:41,750
voluntarily disclosed we need to assure

811
00:45:41,750 --> 00:45:44,390
that privacy is still assured for

812
00:45:44,390 --> 00:45:46,760
example using differential privacy as

813
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:51,310
proposed before and we should have

814
00:45:51,310 --> 00:45:54,860
independent agencies certifying the data

815
00:45:54,860 --> 00:45:57,440
protection of solutions that the

816
00:45:57,440 --> 00:45:59,900
solutions are actually trustworthy and

817
00:45:59,900 --> 00:46:03,190
not just claim to be

818
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:07,670
files on fighting gardens in regime are

819
00:46:07,670 --> 00:46:16,000
finally data quality wrong and H data

820
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:19,700
should are a problem all companies that

821
00:46:19,700 --> 00:46:22,730
hold data about me meet to tell me I'm

822
00:46:22,730 --> 00:46:26,000
as easy as you go to negotiate it up for

823
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:32,300
scoring that means probabilities from

824
00:46:32,300 --> 00:46:36,680
the six months past need to be this

825
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:42,350
close to me and I need to in detail know

826
00:46:42,350 --> 00:46:45,020
which data has been used to calculate a

827
00:46:45,020 --> 00:46:52,070
score algorithms to consumers often have

828
00:46:52,070 --> 00:46:53,510
the feeling of being entirely

829
00:46:53,510 --> 00:46:55,580
transparent to organizations that are

830
00:46:55,580 --> 00:46:57,530
completely in transportation in

831
00:46:57,530 --> 00:46:59,720
transparent to them and we know

832
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:02,360
algorithms can introduce systematic

833
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:05,360
error and we cannot do anything about it

834
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:09,650
merkel in munich said that her personal

835
00:47:09,650 --> 00:47:12,500
opinion is that algorithms should be

836
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:18,800
more transparent and her speaker then

837
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:21,560
corrected they do not want google or

838
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:24,830
facebook to to open their crown jewels

839
00:47:24,830 --> 00:47:31,610
but in principle and was bait in the big

840
00:47:31,610 --> 00:47:34,460
picture how these algorithms work should

841
00:47:34,460 --> 00:47:40,460
be published and there are discussions

842
00:47:40,460 --> 00:47:45,410
about how you mind first time to show

843
00:47:45,410 --> 00:47:49,340
for algorithms i come to result there

844
00:47:49,340 --> 00:47:55,220
there should be some sort of mechanism

845
00:47:55,220 --> 00:48:01,490
to to identify them but companies say we

846
00:48:01,490 --> 00:48:03,790
can't open these out of the rooms

847
00:48:03,790 --> 00:48:05,900
because then they're open to being

848
00:48:05,900 --> 00:48:09,200
manipulated and and then other people

849
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:10,430
could also steal our business model

850
00:48:10,430 --> 00:48:13,440
under suzama hung solution gets up for

851
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:17,640
we're taking crazy so this is speaks to

852
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:21,329
a tension between the the subprime

853
00:48:21,329 --> 00:48:26,130
market manipulation within the US for

854
00:48:26,130 --> 00:48:28,140
Elijah and fry them in traffic so the

855
00:48:28,140 --> 00:48:30,750
users that need to make decisions based

856
00:48:30,750 --> 00:48:36,300
on the when auditing all common on

857
00:48:36,300 --> 00:48:40,310
Gaia's is what we demand is that

858
00:48:40,310 --> 00:48:42,720
algorithms that have an effect on how

859
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:48,000
customers consumers receive things these

860
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,950
algorithms should be audited in camera

861
00:48:49,950 --> 00:48:54,060
behind closed doors in secret and people

862
00:48:54,060 --> 00:48:56,280
who create such algorithms have assured

863
00:48:56,280 --> 00:49:00,800
me that it is in principle possible to

864
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:03,390
discover how parts of the algorithms

865
00:49:03,390 --> 00:49:06,540
work together and to determine more or

866
00:49:06,540 --> 00:49:09,119
less if a systematic error is being

867
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:15,420
introduced with regards to facebook I

868
00:49:15,420 --> 00:49:18,030
have mentioned drawing borders and the

869
00:49:18,030 --> 00:49:22,020
same as the reviewing court has done the

870
00:49:22,020 --> 00:49:26,670
same I'm saying that a gallery should be

871
00:49:26,670 --> 00:49:30,800
a such a fundamental concept that

872
00:49:31,460 --> 00:49:34,260
differences should not be used for the

873
00:49:34,260 --> 00:49:36,829
determination of insurance premiums um

874
00:49:36,829 --> 00:49:41,730
so what we see is women live longer so

875
00:49:41,730 --> 00:49:43,770
the insurance premiums should be higher

876
00:49:43,770 --> 00:49:45,960
from a rational perspective but it's

877
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:49,470
irrational book we cannot do it because

878
00:49:49,470 --> 00:49:53,069
it would violate the Equality so as a

879
00:49:53,069 --> 00:49:56,160
society if we hold such values like

880
00:49:56,160 --> 00:50:00,079
equality high enough we can counteract

881
00:50:00,079 --> 00:50:06,150
economic arguments there should also be

882
00:50:06,150 --> 00:50:08,750
a possibility to

883
00:50:08,750 --> 00:50:11,120
I'm going and Dartmouth approved a

884
00:50:11,120 --> 00:50:14,200
nutritive as a metric I'm locked out

885
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:18,200
check what sort of decisions all tourism

886
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:23,260
have made and to compare to local the

887
00:50:23,260 --> 00:50:26,800
logbooks is this for biomedical column

888
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:29,180
so if we don't I mean you sometimes want

889
00:50:29,180 --> 00:50:33,080
you um so talking about scoring for

890
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:35,900
health when scoring ginga's when tides

891
00:50:35,900 --> 00:50:39,050
on fire fightin Darton anion journeyman

892
00:50:39,050 --> 00:50:41,270
does that was the physical so so and

893
00:50:41,270 --> 00:50:44,120
before something is ok risks course is

894
00:50:44,120 --> 00:50:49,570
is calculated and given to a a company

895
00:50:49,570 --> 00:50:54,740
okay they can only do things when after

896
00:50:54,740 --> 00:50:59,480
data has been aggregated rug rather than

897
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:01,280
then then separated into different

898
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:04,550
pieces lose all data via new low-carbon

899
00:51:04,550 --> 00:51:07,370
photographer abided as magaz amadon far

900
00:51:07,370 --> 00:51:13,730
abided so data is a gutin phone so the

901
00:51:13,730 --> 00:51:15,680
data that is gathered about by you about

902
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:17,930
users is can only be passed on an

903
00:51:17,930 --> 00:51:20,630
aggregated form rather than all of the

904
00:51:20,630 --> 00:51:25,780
individual data is post on for example

905
00:51:25,780 --> 00:51:31,250
rather than pass up which fruit for

906
00:51:31,250 --> 00:51:33,770
electricity at home rather than pass all

907
00:51:33,770 --> 00:51:36,560
of the data up for all devices you put

908
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:39,650
aggregated information on 15 minute

909
00:51:39,650 --> 00:51:42,410
increments or over a year average

910
00:51:42,410 --> 00:51:44,420
averages rather than having to give all

911
00:51:44,420 --> 00:51:46,490
of the tiny individual data about

912
00:51:46,490 --> 00:51:50,210
individual device usage from

913
00:51:50,210 --> 00:51:52,250
differential privacy acquisition so this

914
00:51:52,250 --> 00:51:53,540
is sort of data that can be protected

915
00:51:53,540 --> 00:51:56,780
with differential of privacy but who

916
00:51:56,780 --> 00:52:05,330
decides this day no cons my cousin

917
00:52:05,330 --> 00:52:06,980
Fionna bus routes wiser so for example

918
00:52:06,980 --> 00:52:09,890
on a local bank branch where you know a

919
00:52:09,890 --> 00:52:13,070
local local customer so someone could

920
00:52:13,070 --> 00:52:16,550
actually decide against the score but in

921
00:52:16,550 --> 00:52:19,400
the larger market we normally do things

922
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:20,760
based on Al Gore

923
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:24,460
this demon no saw Nathan so what are we

924
00:52:24,460 --> 00:52:26,230
going to do now with neural nets and

925
00:52:26,230 --> 00:52:28,990
other automated decision making methods

926
00:52:28,990 --> 00:52:31,390
whew Dolph does lead ofa's on

927
00:52:31,390 --> 00:52:33,580
individuals medical an individual iron

928
00:52:33,580 --> 00:52:35,650
pies but time the idea being that

929
00:52:35,650 --> 00:52:37,960
everyone in theory can pay further

930
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:40,839
individual based on their individual

931
00:52:40,839 --> 00:52:43,330
score so I can spazio tackle boxes teams

932
00:52:43,330 --> 00:52:46,359
I my choices Wendy Indian was a

933
00:52:46,359 --> 00:52:48,599
foreigner fairness rhetorical and

934
00:52:48,599 --> 00:52:51,849
four-time spoon on film as I understand

935
00:52:51,849 --> 00:52:54,460
it was kind of when the advantages that

936
00:52:54,460 --> 00:52:57,609
I mentioned in fairness should become

937
00:52:57,609 --> 00:53:01,359
real when when we have this price

938
00:53:01,359 --> 00:53:05,470
differentiation things should normalize

939
00:53:05,470 --> 00:53:10,980
the minimizer's should happen up in the

940
00:53:10,980 --> 00:53:15,880
telematics plans and the normal users

941
00:53:15,880 --> 00:53:18,339
should still end up in the non telematic

942
00:53:18,339 --> 00:53:20,740
tariffs and the the price will rise

943
00:53:20,740 --> 00:53:23,650
accordingly with the result that the

944
00:53:23,650 --> 00:53:27,160
poor will pay more for food for

945
00:53:27,160 --> 00:53:30,520
insurance for for living David kaplowitz

946
00:53:30,520 --> 00:53:35,560
has seen that in 1973 and that has not

947
00:53:35,560 --> 00:53:38,290
changed until today and that will

948
00:53:38,290 --> 00:53:41,410
continue throughout scoring people who

949
00:53:41,410 --> 00:53:44,680
cannot afford a smartphone or a fitness

950
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:47,170
device you cannot afford a new car who

951
00:53:47,170 --> 00:53:50,680
were raised on that food they will pay

952
00:53:50,680 --> 00:53:53,619
more and that is going to be systemic

953
00:53:53,619 --> 00:53:57,190
because of the symptoms of being poor

954
00:53:57,190 --> 00:54:00,400
are correlated with a higher risk for

955
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:04,030
the last slide the free choice of

956
00:54:04,030 --> 00:54:06,310
tariffs needs to be assured even for

957
00:54:06,310 --> 00:54:07,839
people who do not want to be tracked and

958
00:54:07,839 --> 00:54:12,640
scored and it should not be the solution

959
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:15,040
to everything but it's a very important

960
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:20,830
step the short basic income that has

961
00:54:20,830 --> 00:54:22,960
been asked by a lot of people for

962
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:26,740
example seems boss Joe Kaeser who says

963
00:54:26,740 --> 00:54:30,959
that will be inevitable

964
00:54:32,239 --> 00:54:35,489
there is pause and with that I believe

965
00:54:35,489 --> 00:54:39,809
will be moving to the QA Soviets guns

966
00:54:39,809 --> 00:54:41,999
Oliver Tanaka's ex- and Godwin and

967
00:54:41,999 --> 00:54:44,730
Martin you have about 15 minutes of

968
00:54:44,730 --> 00:54:47,309
timers for questions answers please step

969
00:54:47,309 --> 00:54:51,349
up to the microphones and if you are

970
00:54:51,349 --> 00:54:54,539
walking in the cybersphere you can ask

971
00:54:54,539 --> 00:54:57,630
your questions there's interfacing like

972
00:54:57,630 --> 00:54:59,789
a 10 mile toilet down micro number to go

973
00:54:59,789 --> 00:55:03,499
out many thanks for this wonderful

974
00:55:03,499 --> 00:55:05,460
presentation with a lot of interesting

975
00:55:05,460 --> 00:55:08,730
ideas that we I've never seen put

976
00:55:08,730 --> 00:55:11,819
together don't go for movie thanks for

977
00:55:11,819 --> 00:55:16,980
the possibility to give a small question

978
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:22,519
and answer time so we had some wonderful

979
00:55:22,519 --> 00:55:25,940
crypto and possibilities in the first

980
00:55:25,940 --> 00:55:29,670
discussion but there was a question bout

981
00:55:29,670 --> 00:55:33,029
the manipulation of the platform whether

982
00:55:33,029 --> 00:55:35,279
something to manipulate something by

983
00:55:35,279 --> 00:55:37,380
breaking the platform so for example a

984
00:55:37,380 --> 00:55:43,589
toxic platform would looking for mr.

985
00:55:43,589 --> 00:55:46,529
difazzio audience yet would exact okay

986
00:55:46,529 --> 00:55:48,980
would it make more sense perhaps for the

987
00:55:48,980 --> 00:55:54,529
at the government level that the that

988
00:55:54,529 --> 00:55:58,499
mandated or supported the the separation

989
00:55:58,499 --> 00:56:03,059
of high value systems from potentially

990
00:56:03,059 --> 00:56:07,440
toxic toxic systems five minute limit so

991
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:10,650
heated sizes took my leg okay um pass me

992
00:56:10,650 --> 00:56:12,119
I don't necessarily creative what y'all

993
00:56:12,119 --> 00:56:13,890
can do is another Xia is and I what I

994
00:56:13,890 --> 00:56:16,170
don't see a problem is so we have all

995
00:56:16,170 --> 00:56:17,970
these great data sets that are

996
00:56:17,970 --> 00:56:20,789
aggregated soda and a moment we fear

997
00:56:20,789 --> 00:56:22,499
that message to Saddam here in hives me

998
00:56:22,499 --> 00:56:25,109
knew it okay get the stuff your answer

999
00:56:25,109 --> 00:56:30,480
to fill out in his illegal so this is

1000
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:31,950
the last part of the question do we have

1001
00:56:31,950 --> 00:56:36,230
possibilities to combine data sets

1002
00:56:36,230 --> 00:56:41,400
answer it is visible after the election

1003
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:42,420
forum

1004
00:56:42,420 --> 00:56:44,670
and in the in our ministries we have

1005
00:56:44,670 --> 00:56:47,760
more reflection apparently and we have

1006
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:51,270
to say that quite clear and I don't know

1007
00:56:51,270 --> 00:56:56,609
what to do that ridiculous fashion part

1008
00:56:56,609 --> 00:56:59,309
of our government or any the people

1009
00:56:59,309 --> 00:57:03,650
within it seemed javis philosophy that

1010
00:57:03,650 --> 00:57:08,160
we cannot we can trust the Americans in

1011
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:11,880
principle and these people who helped a

1012
00:57:11,880 --> 00:57:15,450
principle are now starting to to change

1013
00:57:15,450 --> 00:57:17,490
their minds and I'm interested to see

1014
00:57:17,490 --> 00:57:22,020
what happens there I've seen is some

1015
00:57:22,020 --> 00:57:28,349
hardware manufacturers have allowed or

1016
00:57:28,349 --> 00:57:31,470
have been forced to allow a back door of

1017
00:57:31,470 --> 00:57:35,369
the NSA there have been gag orders

1018
00:57:35,369 --> 00:57:38,280
preventing people from talking about the

1019
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:41,670
computing industry has try to fight that

1020
00:57:41,670 --> 00:57:44,520
with warrant calories but this is a

1021
00:57:44,520 --> 00:57:52,950
point where there is a need to assure

1022
00:57:52,950 --> 00:57:57,299
system relevant software and for example

1023
00:57:57,299 --> 00:58:01,200
a core Rooter boot system coreboot

1024
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:06,890
system should be run in deterministic

1025
00:58:06,890 --> 00:58:12,780
public fashion and one of the ways to

1026
00:58:12,780 --> 00:58:15,900
chief that is running open source and I

1027
00:58:15,900 --> 00:58:19,290
want to support development in that

1028
00:58:19,290 --> 00:58:23,760
direction I cyber bitter harder on your

1029
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:27,119
point and the second question I do not

1030
00:58:27,119 --> 00:58:30,359
have a solution pseudonymity and animas

1031
00:58:30,359 --> 00:58:33,930
ation is being asked for in data

1032
00:58:33,930 --> 00:58:38,010
protection everywhere it's we do know

1033
00:58:38,010 --> 00:58:42,240
it's quite easy to remove these layers

1034
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:44,970
of analyzation and I am torn as a

1035
00:58:44,970 --> 00:58:48,910
sociology I would love to see

1036
00:58:48,910 --> 00:58:51,970
to be able to use all of that data but I

1037
00:58:51,970 --> 00:58:57,250
also see the dangers and I would like to

1038
00:58:57,250 --> 00:59:01,720
do that in a responsible way one final

1039
00:59:01,720 --> 00:59:05,230
point differential privacy is one of the

1040
00:59:05,230 --> 00:59:07,510
very promising approaches in the right

1041
00:59:07,510 --> 00:59:10,390
direction and we have to look at that in

1042
00:59:10,390 --> 00:59:14,890
more concrete way there are steps going

1043
00:59:14,890 --> 00:59:18,480
in there it's not easy and it's not a

1044
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:22,750
final solution to that problem as I had

1045
00:59:22,750 --> 00:59:27,100
in the slides we cannot well we cannot

1046
00:59:27,100 --> 00:59:30,460
measure how much trust in privacy is

1047
00:59:30,460 --> 00:59:36,670
lost and there is a some border in our

1048
00:59:36,670 --> 00:59:38,700
study we will actually have epsilon

1049
00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:42,910
proposals for further parameters and

1050
00:59:42,910 --> 00:59:45,910
that was it applause to both those

1051
00:59:45,910 --> 00:59:49,540
speakers please thank you very much for

1052
00:59:49,540 --> 00:59:51,430
