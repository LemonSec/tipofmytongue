00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,519
next talk is going to be

3
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:17,680
shut up and take my money by vincent

4
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:18,960
halpert

5
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,039
vincent is a research associate at the

6
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:22,400
security research group

7
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,400
of the department of computer science at

8
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,480
friedrich alexander universitate in

9
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:27,519
erlangen

10
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:30,880
nuremberg germany typical very long

11
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:33,439
german word

12
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:35,360
his main research interests are

13
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,520
authentication system security

14
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,120
and software protection of mobile

15
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,879
devices there's actually vincent's

16
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:43,120
second time speaking of the congress

17
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,840
last year his talk discussed conceptual

18
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,039
insecurity

19
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:49,840
of app generated passwords in online

20
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:50,719
banking

21
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:52,800
this year he will discuss the practical

22
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:53,840
aspects

23
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,879
and some successful hacks

24
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:59,280
that if i recall correctly took over

25
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,399
entire bank accounts

26
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:03,120
from users mobile apps with that vincent

27
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,600
over to you

28
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,080
yeah hello again thanks for the warm

29
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:14,960
welcome

30
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,680
and let's dive right into it because we

31
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,680
have a tough program

32
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,640
okay first of all online banking is

33
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,799
something that affects us all

34
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:28,000
because virtually everybody uses it um

35
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,920
in traditional online banking we use two

36
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,680
devices one

37
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,880
to initiate our payments and to log in

38
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,799
with username and password

39
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:39,439
and another device to confirm

40
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:41,040
transactions

41
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,040
with the rise of mobile devices

42
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,119
app-based confirmation procedures became

43
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:45,759
popular

44
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:50,320
like um like this app there

45
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:53,840
in in the recent past what i have been

46
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:54,640
talking about

47
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:59,040
last year um yeah it became popular

48
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,840
to implement those two devices in two

49
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,280
apps that means you only have

50
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,799
one single device and have two apps now

51
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:10,800
to authenticate transactions

52
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,560
yeah last year i showed that this has

53
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,400
severe conceptional drawbacks

54
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,440
but this is not the end of it

55
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:25,040
there the latest evolution in the um

56
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,920
in online banking are now one app

57
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,080
authentication models

58
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,920
i already said this last year actually

59
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,840
it doesn't make so much difference

60
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,800
so banks are no longer faking to have

61
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,440
real two

62
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,920
on two-factor authentication it's now

63
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,280
clear that it's just

64
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,280
one so you do the transaction

65
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,280
transaction initialization

66
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,519
inside the app and the confirmation is

67
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:51,280
just another dialogue inside the app

68
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:55,040
this time i want to talk about n26

69
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,599
yeah the shining star on the german

70
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:59,519
fintechs guy

71
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:02,959
and yeah actually

72
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:05,680
this time i only going to be talking

73
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,239
about

74
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:09,519
technical issues um and yet it's

75
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:12,239
clear that we have similar conceptual

76
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:13,440
problems like with two app

77
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,400
authentication

78
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,879
but i will focus on technical issues

79
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:19,040
because we have enough of this

80
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:23,120
there briefly about n26

81
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,920
um n26 is a berlin-based mobile first

82
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,239
fintech and it plans

83
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:30,239
yeah to establish your smartphone as

84
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:32,239
your financial hub for everything

85
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:35,120
yeah so that you can do little literally

86
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:35,840
everything

87
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,959
from inside the app actually it's only

88
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:39,760
founded

89
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,720
in 2013 it started in 2015 with their

90
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,640
app and it already has over 200 000

91
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:45,519
customers

92
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:49,360
which is astonishing actually

93
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:51,920
it now also has its own european banking

94
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:52,560
license

95
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,599
it's only i think half a year ago and

96
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:58,879
it announced not not even one month ago

97
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:01,040
that it's now available in 17 european

98
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,799
countries

99
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:05,439
and they also claim that you can open a

100
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:07,599
bank account in just 8 minutes

101
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:11,330
as it turns out you can lose it even

102
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:12,840
[Music]

103
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,480
faster

104
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,040
okay all right just like so let's talk

105
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,120
briefly about transaction security in

106
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,358
the number 26 app if you want to do a

107
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:23,440
transaction you at first need to log in

108
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,840
this works with your user username in

109
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,520
this case it's just your email address

110
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,880
and your password this is pretty

111
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,960
standard afterwards you're good

112
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:34,000
to initiate and transaction after you

113
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,240
entered all the details you also have to

114
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,000
supply a transfer code this is just a

115
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,199
four digit

116
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:41,759
number um you use this also to withdraw

117
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:42,479
cash

118
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:45,520
probably you would call this pin um the

119
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,800
last

120
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,479
last factor in this authentic

121
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:50,240
authentication scheme is your paired

122
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,600
phone this is actually the most

123
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,320
important

124
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:56,000
security feature um of the n26 account

125
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,960
and you can only pair one smartphone

126
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,800
with your n26 account

127
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,039
that means um from a technical

128
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:04,080
perspective

129
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,160
the n26 app the first time the very

130
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,280
first time you started

131
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:10,000
generates an rsa key pair and sets the

132
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,080
public key to the n26 back end and

133
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,919
whenever you initiate a transaction

134
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:15,600
they are going to send an encrypted

135
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,120
challenge to

136
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,960
your smartphone and that you send it

137
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,240
back decrypted

138
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,520
that's how it works actually repairing

139
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,280
that means pairing another phone is a

140
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,560
pretty well secured

141
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,720
um process but we will talk about this

142
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,560
later

143
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,160
just uh to talk about like the

144
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,320
infrastructure of n26

145
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,400
basically they have two apps one for ios

146
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,360
one for android

147
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,520
and they communicate over a json-based

148
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,720
protocol

149
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,919
tls encrypted the backend is at

150
00:05:44,919 --> 00:05:46,880
api.tech26.de

151
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,320
how do i know actually that this is a

152
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,160
json-based protocol because i

153
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,360
used atls mitten attack and then in the

154
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,240
middle attack

155
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,600
to learn the protocol um i actually

156
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,919
suspect that i only needed to install a

157
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:01,759
certificate emitted proxy certificate on

158
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:02,639
the client

159
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:04,479
but actually i was surprised that they

160
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:06,400
didn't need to touch the client

161
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,680
because they didn't implement any

162
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,440
certificate pinning

163
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,600
so

164
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:16,240
[Applause]

165
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,360
so that means it's

166
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,880
that the first thing that comes into

167
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,800
mind is like let's do real-time

168
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,039
transaction manipulation that means we

169
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:26,880
manipulate a transaction that the user

170
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:27,600
does

171
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,560
um but we will change the recipient and

172
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,360
the user won't see nothing about this

173
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,160
so if you look at this graphic again

174
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,240
what if an attacker could get the dns

175
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:42,000
record of api.tech26de under his control

176
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,639
this would would mean that all traffic

177
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:46,800
is rooted over the man in the middle

178
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,919
attacker server and as there is no

179
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:52,000
certificate pinning we could just issue

180
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,039
a let's encrypt tls certificate

181
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:57,840
and the app is going to trust the

182
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,840
certificate

183
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,800
how does this work let's take an example

184
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,160
here

185
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,080
let's imagine i want to transfer two

186
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,160
euro to my friend dominic

187
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,599
after i entered all the transaction

188
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:11,759
details i have to enter my transfer code

189
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:12,960
too

190
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,759
when i did this i get like the second

191
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:16,960
factor where you need the

192
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,599
um the paired device and i need to

193
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:21,120
confirm it this is just like the next

194
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,160
dialogue inside

195
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,039
the app after i confirmed it that

196
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:26,639
transaction went through everything

197
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:27,599
looks good

198
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:30,319
and two euro less on my account pretty

199
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:32,160
good

200
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,919
in the next step you you can see in your

201
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:38,000
transaction overview 2 that there are

202
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,240
2 euro less but after the attack when

203
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,280
n26

204
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,039
realized that something wrong was going

205
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:44,560
on and they fixed it

206
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,400
you will realize that we actually

207
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,160
transferred 20 euros

208
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,080
not two but this was completely

209
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,400
transparent for the user even after the

210
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,639
attack

211
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:56,800
okay this is nice and we can we can

212
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,120
manipulate a transaction real time

213
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,160
but wouldn't it be even better

214
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,039
and more interesting to take over entire

215
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:08,560
accounts to do our own transactions

216
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,479
and for this we need the login

217
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:12,479
credentials the transfer code and the

218
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:13,440
paired phone

219
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,960
so we need to obtain all of them

220
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:20,479
let's start with the login credentials

221
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,639
actually i want to assume to him partly

222
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:24,560
or mostly that the login

223
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,199
credentials are already compromised but

224
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:28,639
there are some weak points in the

225
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:31,039
n26 transaction or in the security

226
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:32,080
system of them that

227
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,120
um yeah make it an easier task to obtain

228
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,200
those login credentials

229
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,958
there are two things i want to talk

230
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:40,799
about yes the first thing is the

231
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:42,799
recovery from loss procedure when you

232
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:44,159
forgot your password

233
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:48,080
n2x n26 just sends an email to your

234
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:48,959
email account

235
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:50,560
there's a link inside you click it and

236
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:53,360
you can just reset the password

237
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:57,279
and this yeah breaks the n26 password

238
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:58,000
policy

239
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,279
which is actually pretty solid because

240
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:03,839
if you have access to the email account

241
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:04,720
you can

242
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,720
have automatically access to the n26

243
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,080
account too and

244
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,760
the access to the email account could be

245
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,240
as bad as password or one two three four

246
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,000
five six

247
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,560
another idea is spear fishing think of

248
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,600
spear fishing like

249
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,080
a more targeted version of fishing what

250
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,600
you always need for phishing is a

251
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,080
similar

252
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,800
domain something the user can relate to

253
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:25,360
and

254
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,959
um if you want to make spear efficient

255
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:28,560
you want to have it more targeted that

256
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,200
means

257
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,680
you want to expose n26 customers to only

258
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,360
send out mails to them

259
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,440
and you need to have a valid reason to

260
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,080
contact them

261
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,560
for about the domain usually n26 uses

262
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,240
number 26.de

263
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,680
to and for password resets for example

264
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:49,680
i think number26.tag sounds pretty valid

265
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,880
in my eyes only by chance i happen to

266
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,760
own that domain

267
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:00,800
the next and next thing is exposing n26

268
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:01,760
customers

269
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:05,040
n26 offers peer-to-peer transactions

270
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:05,680
that means

271
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,600
if you have if your recipient also has

272
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,800
an n26

273
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:12,399
account those transactions are instant

274
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:15,600
to show the n26 customers

275
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,480
who of his contacts actually have an n26

276
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,279
account

277
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:21,920
they upload all of the email addresses

278
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,920
all of their and phone numbers

279
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:27,360
in your address book to the n26 backend

280
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:33,839
unhatched yeah

281
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,480
but how can we use but we actually want

282
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,240
to use this to identify

283
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,000
customers of a given data set we can

284
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,519
actually abuse this api for that

285
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:46,320
do you remember the recent dropbox leak

286
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:46,959
that

287
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:49,600
revealed 68 million accounts we

288
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,880
evaluated all of those 68 email accounts

289
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,399
against this api

290
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:57,200
and n26 took no notice of this there

291
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:57,680
were no

292
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,600
limits applied they just think i'm

293
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,360
really popular

294
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,120
listen

295
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,379
[Applause]

296
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:14,000
yeah in the end we revealed um 33 000

297
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,959
and 26 customers and could now send out

298
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:17,519
um

299
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:19,440
emails to them actually this also

300
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,720
provides a valid reason

301
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,920
to contact them for example um the usual

302
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,880
email of n26 looks somehow like this

303
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:27,279
yeah

304
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:29,360
so we could say to them hey you're

305
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,040
affected by the dropbox leak

306
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,880
um please change your password for your

307
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,800
own security

308
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,600
actually and then like here click this

309
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,880
link to change your password yeah

310
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:44,399
now i can already see the grow the n26

311
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:45,519
management board

312
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:48,480
um yeah nervous but don't worry we

313
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,600
didn't do this

314
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,020
my professor had legal concerns

315
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:54,880
[Music]

316
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:58,079
this okay now that

317
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:01,040
that we have the login credentials um i

318
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,480
we have to wonder can we actually

319
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,000
already do something with those login

320
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,200
credentials

321
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,720
and this brings me to siri transactions

322
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,440
with ios 10 n26 now supports

323
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,360
transactions using siri

324
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,519
that means now you can just say send

325
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:18,480
five years to dominic meyer using n26

326
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,440
then the transaction pops up and you can

327
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:21,839
say

328
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:24,480
send it and afterwards it's gone the app

329
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,839
doesn't even open

330
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:31,040
yeah so this already sounds wrong but

331
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,200
but you can only do this with the paired

332
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,320
device if you

333
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,880
if you use another phone and just log in

334
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,120
and try to use siri with this

335
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,279
and this dialog appears and you really

336
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:42,160
have to open

337
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,240
the app and you have to confirm it with

338
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,639
the paired phone

339
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:49,440
as it turns out this is just a client

340
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,000
feature

341
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,680
yeah so they uh so what they do

342
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,360
this is actually the entire payload you

343
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,360
need you just it's like five euros it's

344
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,440
totally meyer that's the phone number

345
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,000
and look at look at this api endpoint

346
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,839
transactions unverified

347
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:07,760
uh yeah okay so it turns out

348
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,839
you don't need the paired phone to do

349
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:12,959
this type of transactions

350
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,440
yet another thing that's interesting is

351
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,160
that n26 claims that they have some

352
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,639
intelligent algorithms to immediately

353
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:27,200
detect

354
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,200
irregularities and to prevent fraud

355
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,839
before it even occurs

356
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:35,360
so we thought challenge accepted

357
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:38,240
[Applause]

358
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,639
so and what we actually did and i think

359
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:42,720
this is pretty irregular

360
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,519
we sent 2 000 series transactions worth

361
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:46,399
one cent

362
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:49,519
within 30 minutes

363
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,399
so try to speak that fast

364
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:58,639
okay and so what happened like we waited

365
00:13:58,639 --> 00:13:59,360
the next day

366
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:02,560
the day after nobody actually

367
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,320
made contact with us and we thought they

368
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,000
would never actually

369
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,320
make contact but over three weeks later

370
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,360
n26

371
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,680
required dominic to explain the unusual

372
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,519
amount of transactions

373
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,680
okay and they even threatened to cancel

374
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,519
his account i mean this is actually um

375
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:17,920
yeah

376
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,839
it's reasonable because it's yeah it's a

377
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:21,519
clear misuse of their account

378
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:23,920
and um violence the terms of service of

379
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,600
them but

380
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,000
dominic didn't send those transactions

381
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,600
he received them

382
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,720
so they contacted the wrong person

383
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:35,199
yeah this is kind of like if you if

384
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:37,040
gmail cancels your account because you

385
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:45,839
received spam

386
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:49,279
[Applause]

387
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:51,199
okay let's let's get back to the account

388
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:52,320
hijacking

389
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,560
and the next thing we need to obtain is

390
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,240
the transfer code and get to control

391
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,720
over the paired phone

392
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,560
what we will do with the transfer code

393
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,560
is we will try to reset it

394
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:05,440
and the paired phone we have to unpair

395
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,320
actually those

396
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,720
processes are not as independent as it

397
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:09,760
seems so

398
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:13,839
i will right start with the paired phone

399
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:16,320
as i told in the beginning unpairing is

400
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,320
actually a highly secured process and i

401
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:18,720
mean

402
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:22,399
this really this is my serious opinion

403
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:25,440
so let's look at the process at first

404
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,920
when you want to pair a new phone like i

405
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:28,959
said you need to unpair

406
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:30,720
the existing one therefore you open the

407
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,199
app then you click at unpair

408
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:36,240
and afterwards and they send a link to

409
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,120
your

410
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:40,399
email account then in the email you need

411
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:41,199
to follow

412
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:44,399
the unpairing email at the unpairing

413
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:47,440
link in the next step

414
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:50,240
the real unpre unpairing process starts

415
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,199
where you have to

416
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:53,839
enter your transfer code first then your

417
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:55,680
mastercard id this is something that's

418
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,320
kind of special for and 26 like every

419
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,839
n26 account comes

420
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:02,560
with a mastercard and they have printed

421
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,959
a 10 digit numerical token below your

422
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:05,759
name

423
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:07,519
and i don't know what this actually is

424
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:08,800
it's not the pen it's not the credit

425
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,079
card number but some

426
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:12,639
other sort of token so you need to have

427
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:14,639
um the mastercard actually

428
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:16,399
and in the last step they are going to

429
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:18,079
send an sms to you

430
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:20,160
with a token and you have to enter it

431
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,000
and only after this process the

432
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,920
unpairing is done

433
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:26,000
so that means we need to have access to

434
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,199
the email account

435
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:29,199
we need to know the transfer code we

436
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:30,560
need to have the mastercard

437
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,079
and we need to own the sim card in order

438
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:34,240
to reach the receive the

439
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:39,519
token you can screw up each of those

440
00:16:41,170 --> 00:16:46,750
[Music]

441
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:51,519
okay let's go into it so the first thing

442
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:54,000
when you actually click on that on that

443
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,079
item in your app where it says

444
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:59,040
start unpairing it sends this is

445
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,399
basically http

446
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:03,279
get request but you wouldn't believe

447
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:05,839
that they sent the link as a response

448
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:09,760
yeah so that it's not displayed but

449
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:12,400
it it's there so you don't need to have

450
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,000
access to the email account because it's

451
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:19,199
in the response

452
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:23,280
yep okay next thing the transfer code

453
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,880
and i actually will skip this for the

454
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,799
moment and we'll get right back to this

455
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:28,319
but the next thing is actually the

456
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:30,160
master card id and

457
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:33,039
yeah this id is printed on the card and

458
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:34,880
we don't have access to the into that

459
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:35,679
card

460
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:39,280
so what will we do um

461
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:42,160
in the transaction overview n26 shows a

462
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,840
lot of properties for example like the

463
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,280
amount the beneficiary

464
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:49,760
whatever yeah so and it turns out that

465
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,799
this that they used

466
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:55,360
this mastercard id they thought oh this

467
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,559
is actually a nice id

468
00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:59,840
let's use it as a prefix yeah so again

469
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,679
this is not displayed to the user inside

470
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:03,600
the app but it's clearly there in the

471
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:07,360
api it's way too verbose

472
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:12,840
[Applause]

473
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,799
so

474
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:18,480
okay so whenever um

475
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,440
the let the the step that i just skipped

476
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,200
was this transfer code

477
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,520
and the transfer code is unknown yeah so

478
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,240
but

479
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:29,200
you can reset the transfer code and it

480
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,400
is as it turns out

481
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,480
what you need to reset the transfer code

482
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:42,799
is the mastercard id

483
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:45,919
so you you need to enter those

484
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:48,720
this mastercard id that we just that i

485
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,240
just told how we will get it

486
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,120
and then we just will confirm our new

487
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:53,840
transfer

488
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:57,600
code think of one i don't know any code

489
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,520
and therefore we don't know and we don't

490
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,960
need to know the transfer code not even

491
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,200
the old one because it's not required

492
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:06,559
the mastercard id is sufficient

493
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:10,240
then um the last step sms

494
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,080
the sim card is inaccessible we don't

495
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,600
have access to that phone

496
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:16,400
um but this is a five digit token that

497
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,440
they send out

498
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:20,160
and it's only numbers i mean this is 100

499
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,320
000 possibilities yeah

500
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:25,440
and even full the login procedure

501
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,840
the login form has a brute force

502
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:28,880
protection

503
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,480
this doesn't have any brute force

504
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,960
protection

505
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:36,880
so the maximum that i could get out of

506
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,799
the back end was 160

507
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:41,840
requests per second

508
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:53,840
so this means

509
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:57,360
so that means that it takes on average

510
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:57,840
um

511
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,480
yeah approximately five minutes to get

512
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:03,280
uh this token

513
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,200
yeah so in the end we will just brute

514
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,360
force it and that's it

515
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:10,399
okay let's

516
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,559
let's look if this really works yeah so

517
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:16,880
at first we will log into the app just

518
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,159
to see that it's paired

519
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:21,280
and if it wouldn't be paired we would

520
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,240
now

521
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,320
like see a dialogue that we should pair

522
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,799
our phone

523
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:30,720
so now so it opens great

524
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:34,480
and now we will start our

525
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:38,159
script and n26 claimed

526
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:41,120
that this attack doesn't scale just

527
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:41,520
don't

528
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:44,080
don't blink

529
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:46,400
so loud those are the logging

530
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,080
credentials now we do

531
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,080
do all the fun and actually everything

532
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:51,200
already happened it's just the brute

533
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,120
forcing that now takes place

534
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,440
and i have to admit that i have been

535
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,799
really lucky this time

536
00:20:56,799 --> 00:21:02,320
because we are done now yeah

537
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,320
so um like there are this is the

538
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,400
response now the sms numeric token is

539
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,520
valid and the phone has been

540
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,039
successfully unpaired

541
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:11,600
so okay now let's verify in the app if

542
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:12,159
this worked

543
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:15,600
really yeah so let's open it again

544
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,880
okay touch id expired so this is

545
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,720
actually good that means that

546
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,880
and something happened let's log in with

547
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:25,600
our password

548
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,960
and there it prompts us for pairing the

549
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,700
phone so it worked

550
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:41,230
[Applause]

551
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:44,000
[Music]

552
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,480
this this uh even though i said that

553
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:47,200
this attacks

554
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,440
really scales very well it has a

555
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,640
drawback because

556
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:53,360
um three males are sent out to the user

557
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,720
the first one when you actually start

558
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,640
the unpairing the second one when you

559
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,799
reset the transfer pin and the third one

560
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:00,480
when the unpairing is successful

561
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:03,840
and the user also receives an sms but

562
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,799
it i i mean fraud is perfectly possible

563
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:09,360
but is there a possibility to avoid this

564
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,600
so let's try to call the customer

565
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:14,400
support yeah

566
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,400
the customer support is actually the

567
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,960
most powerful entity in the n26 security

568
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:19,440
model

569
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,679
because they can even change things you

570
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:23,200
can't change inside the app

571
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,120
for example your email address or name

572
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,400
you cannot change

573
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:29,919
yeah but they can so let's talk with

574
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:30,880
them

575
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,880
they can it turns out that they can also

576
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,880
unpair phones yeah

577
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:37,360
so now the question arises of course you

578
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:38,880
cannot just call there and say hey my

579
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,960
name is vincent please unpair my phone

580
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,520
of course they going to authenticate you

581
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:43,980
and what

582
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:46,799
[Music]

583
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:48,799
and what what will they ask they will

584
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:51,200
ask for the mastercard id

585
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,600
that we know that the current account

586
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,120
balance is always available if you have

587
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,320
the login credentials

588
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,679
okay there's one thing that's still

589
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:00,320
missing place of birth

590
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:03,360
it's always the same

591
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:05,600
[Music]

592
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:08,080
it's it's again you can't see this

593
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,600
information inside the app

594
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,760
yet it's just a displayed it but it's

595
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,440
there there's so much information you

596
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,320
can't think of

597
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:18,158
really they know more about me than i do

598
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,880
okay so now that means we have all

599
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,720
information available and we can change

600
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:25,600
any data and the user won't receive any

601
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:28,000
notice of that yeah so no email nothing

602
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
so we can just unpair the phone and

603
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,280
later we can

604
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,120
pair our own one or like this is

605
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:36,320
perfectly stealth

606
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:39,919
now actually i heard already ah

607
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:42,640
i only got 50 euros on my account why

608
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:45,520
should i care

609
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,760
this is actually a valid argument

610
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,440
because yeah many

611
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:52,960
n26 accounts are opened out of curiosity

612
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:56,080
and many are inactive or not

613
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,159
using it seriously that means you only

614
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:00,000
use it for traveling or

615
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,600
paying things online because of the

616
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,360
conditions but you don't use it as a

617
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,640
salary account so there's

618
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:08,400
frequently not so much money um in it

619
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:11,919
but as this wants to be the financial

620
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:12,799
hub for all

621
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:15,840
services you of course can also you

622
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:18,559
apply for an overdraft yeah and this is

623
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:20,400
an instant overdraft that is granted

624
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:20,799
during

625
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:23,840
two minutes and it's between

626
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:26,480
if you have guaranteed 50 euro and up to

627
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,279
2000

628
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:30,159
and this requires the paired device what

629
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:31,360
did we just do

630
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,919
uh we have the pad device we have the

631
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:34,960
entire account

632
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:38,159
so what do we do we will just um hijack

633
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:39,039
the account

634
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:41,840
then we apply for an overdraft and and

635
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:42,720
then we will take

636
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:45,360
all the money he has as a balance and as

637
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,120
an overdraft

638
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:49,039
so even if you don't have money on your

639
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:50,320
account and think you're safe

640
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,960
you are not

641
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:59,840
okay this was was quite a bit something

642
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:01,440
i want to talk briefly about the

643
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,120
exclosure before

644
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:06,159
i will draw my conclusion

645
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:10,000
um i reported all these issues to n26 on

646
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,520
september 25

647
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:14,000
i didn't establish the contact this was

648
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:14,799
the ccc

649
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:16,880
thank you for that and i did this

650
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,640
because i didn't know how n26 would

651
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:19,360
react to

652
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:22,480
this kind of vulnerabilities but

653
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,880
actually there was no reason to think so

654
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:25,600
because

655
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:28,720
they acted really professional and yeah

656
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,080
they were actually

657
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:33,840
thankful that i revealed these

658
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:43,840
vulnerabilities

659
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:47,919
yeah then afterwards um they started to

660
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:50,080
incrementally fix the issues i don't

661
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,120
know when they

662
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,799
fixed the first thing i didn't monitor

663
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:54,240
the process

664
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,480
but the last fix i know of happened on

665
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,000
december 13 when they implemented

666
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,200
certificate pinning

667
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:02,640
on ios and apparently i have to say that

668
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,000
i didn't check

669
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,880
everything but apparently all issues are

670
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:09,440
resolved

671
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:12,640
but what what are the consequences out

672
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:13,279
of this

673
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:15,679
it is obvious that n26 needs to put more

674
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:17,520
emphasize on security

675
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:20,159
it's important to notice that this

676
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:20,799
wasn't

677
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:24,640
a coincidence it simply wasn't

678
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,880
and n26 needs to understand that it's

679
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,320
not enough to release videos with

680
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,240
caption mobile first meet safety first

681
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,520
and to claim that securities of

682
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:34,240
paramount importance of him of them

683
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:38,960
so pr shouldn't do your security

684
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:41,440
and it's funny if you if you visit the

685
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,120
n26 homepage

686
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,960
you will find out that they currently

687
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,320
have 44

688
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:49,520
open positions not even one is dedicated

689
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:53,039
to security

690
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:55,760
furthermore with such a strategy fintech

691
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,200
squandered the trust in financial

692
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,440
institutions that banks established

693
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:02,320
um yeah over years actually today you

694
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,520
usually trust

695
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:06,000
in your bank that they will deal with

696
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,400
your money responsibly

697
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,159
and in the end you also need to question

698
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:11,679
authorities i mean

699
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:14,799
it was baffin that that granted a

700
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:18,000
banking license to n26 only six months

701
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:18,640
ago

702
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:21,279
and really those vulnerabilities are

703
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:22,159
inside

704
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:26,000
for longer time

705
00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:29,520
okay i think like

706
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:32,640
a resume for this is they you shouldn't

707
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,880
say works for me when it's about

708
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:37,679
security yeah so

709
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:49,840
so thank you

710
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:01,200
thank you vin thank you vincent that was

711
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,760
awesome and also kind of scary

712
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:06,559
i we only have a short time for

713
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:07,760
questions

714
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:12,080
is there anybody who has a question for

715
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:17,840
vincent

716
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,720
you know i guess everybody is out

717
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:24,000
deleting banking apps

718
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:31,520
oh number six

719
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:34,640
so quick question is microphone on okay

720
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:37,840
um do you know whether they have

721
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:41,200
disallowed those apps that have not yet

722
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,320
been updated

723
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,399
to still manage their bank account so

724
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:46,720
for example if someone has a mobile

725
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:49,919
app that has not yet been updated to the

726
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:51,279
version that includes certificate

727
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:51,840
pinning

728
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,600
would that person still be vulnerable to

729
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:56,559
men in the middle attacks

730
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:58,799
yes

731
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:01,200
so they actually they they don't have so

732
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,320
much of an idea

733
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:03,919
which device you are using they don't

734
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:06,240
even know which is the pad device this

735
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:09,360
is only a client value

736
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:13,760
do two more i think i'll hear number one

737
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,440

number five please so

749
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:44,480
during your talk you name dropped let's

750
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:45,840
encrypt and you kind of glossed over

751
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:46,559
that bit

752
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:47,760
about getting them to issue a

753
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,919
certificate for their api host name

754
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:51,780
do you know something i don't

755
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:52,960
[Music]

756
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:55,279
uh like the question i get i don't so

757
00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:56,240
you you mentioned

758
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,960
getting a let's encrypt certificate to

759
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,480
impersonate their api hosting because

760
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:01,679
they weren't using certificate

761
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:03,440
pinning how about how did you go about

762
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:05,840
doing that but i didn't do this like was

763
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:06,240
a

764
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:09,600
scenario this yeah

765
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,919
that's an attack scenario okay i didn't

766
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:14,000
i didn't hijack the dns record oh

767
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,640
okay sorry

768
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:20,320
