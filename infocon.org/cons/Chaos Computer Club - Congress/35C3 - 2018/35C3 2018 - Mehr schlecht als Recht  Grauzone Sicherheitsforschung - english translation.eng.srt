<font color="#E5E5E5">personally couldn't really understand</font>

200
00:11:56,780 --> 00:12:01,579
just remind me I forgot<font color="#E5E5E5"> it completely it</font>

201
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:04,280
wasn't exactly as it was they they said

205
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:16,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">that and that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wonderful</font>

206
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:20,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">really so the legal background okay what</font>

207
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:22,880
follows now we didn't know it at<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

208
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:26,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">time at all that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just what we found</font>

00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:29,000
out<font color="#E5E5E5"> afterwards</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> everything that is to</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">come in this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in this talk so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we are not</font>

212
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:37,070
that but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I try</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to explain to you what</font>

213
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:40,010
the problem is<font color="#CCCCCC"> legally as far as we</font>

understand for our analysis of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">software we used different</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> methods from</font>

218
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:53,870

different static analysis methods can

for<font color="#CCCCCC"> example put it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> execute it in an</font>

223
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:09,290
and look slowly what it does and execute

00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:13,029
it in a debugger<font color="#E5E5E5"> for example and you can</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">see the register values changing or</font>

227
00:13:17,639 --> 00:13:24,999
legally you must never decompile<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is</font>

00:14:51,040 --> 00:15:01,329
forbidden so you have to really so the

255
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:02,799
ideas<font color="#CCCCCC"> may be the year</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then the program</font>

256
00:15:01,329 --> 00:15:04,179
isn't executed in its natural

257
00:15:02,799 --> 00:15:11,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">environment anymore</font>

258
00:15:04,179 --> 00:15:13,869
so yeah it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> difficult also</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sometimes</font>

259
00:15:11,679 --> 00:15:17,079
some are of<font color="#E5E5E5"> opinion that disassembly is</font>

260
00:15:13,869 --> 00:15:23,880
already forbidden disassembling and if

261
00:15:17,079 --> 00:15:26,160
you really<font color="#CCCCCC"> just use the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hex codes and</font>

262
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:28,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">and then have the opcodes in your mind</font>

263
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:30,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's allowed but if you use a tool for</font>

264
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:35,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for disassembling that's forbidden</font>

265
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:39,900
perhaps and our goal<font color="#E5E5E5"> was really we</font>

266
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:41,850
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted we had no we really</font>

267
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:43,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">weren't looking for for a struggle but</font>

268
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:46,250
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> weren't looking for a fight but what</font>

269
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:49,860
can we do without compromising our

270
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:52,170
scientific integrity and to really make

271
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:54,480
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> more acceptable to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the claimant</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

272
00:15:52,170 --> 00:16:00,479
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> decide we talked to them and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

273
00:15:54,480 --> 00:16:04,590
formula<font color="#E5E5E5"> some sentences we took out maybe</font>

274
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:09,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">and we couldn't really say we struck out</font>

275
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:18,150
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we couldn't well in the</font>

276
00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:20,250
end we really retracted<font color="#E5E5E5"> the paper so we</font>

277
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:21,870
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a consequence of the X our</font>

278
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:24,780
acceptance of the season to<font color="#E5E5E5"> sister claw</font>

279
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:31,200
raishin really<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then we went on</font>

280
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:33,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">holiday and hope</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the storm was over yeah</font>

281
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:37,950
so we had a weekend<font color="#E5E5E5"> of calm and quiet</font>

282
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:47,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">here we have an unboxing video</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of what</font>

283
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:52,340
came in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the next</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> week</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah it's not</font>

284
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:57,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">really reusable but a lot of content and</font>

285
00:16:52,340 --> 00:17:02,040
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> see here a large volume a large</font>

286
00:16:57,930 --> 00:17:10,770
amount of papers and that was the letter

287
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:13,680
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the court and they wanted here a</font>

288
00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:19,139
preliminary injunction<font color="#E5E5E5"> but the court</font>

289
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:20,670
said this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> very complex topic</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so yeah</font>

290
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:24,900
and there's a large sum of money

291
00:17:20,670 --> 00:17:30,090
involved here<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> court can just</font>

292
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:32,420
accept that the injunction or<font color="#E5E5E5"> the court</font>

293
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:36,230
says yeah we we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

294
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:40,100
have here a real process here with

295
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:46,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">lawyers and people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> need to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be there</font>

296
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:49,070
personally<font color="#E5E5E5"> so after a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

297
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:54,350
communication we we wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to yeah go</font>

298
00:17:49,070 --> 00:18:00,409
there and see what happens<font color="#E5E5E5"> but there was</font>

299
00:17:54,350 --> 00:18:03,860
a lot of writing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the court to to show</font>

300
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:07,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">that the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> opposing side was yeah kind of</font>

301
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:11,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">talking out of their behind and then we</font>

302
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:16,640
met in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> courtroom and was pretty full</font>

303
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:30,800
and they never had such a full<font color="#E5E5E5"> civil</font>

304
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:35,120
process it was very interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> it was a</font>

305
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:36,680
long<font color="#E5E5E5"> process our lawyer thought it would</font>

306
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:44,290
be two hours<font color="#CCCCCC"> then in the end</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it was</font>

307
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:46,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">seven yeah</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there was some interesting</font>

308
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:52,970
small gems that happened there

309
00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:57,080
for example the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the lawyers of the</font>

310
00:18:52,970 --> 00:19:01,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">claimants said things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like the security</font>

311
00:18:57,080 --> 00:19:04,100
of the software of our client<font color="#CCCCCC"> it cannot</font>

312
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:06,920
really be guaranteed if we discuss this

313
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:12,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">security in public so that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> their</font>

314
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:14,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting the court did their job</font>

315
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:21,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">pretty well they actually looked</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> into</font>

316
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:26,780
the whole topic and the court writer

317
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:28,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">went home at some point because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> she</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

318
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:35,750
done<font color="#CCCCCC"> with her shift</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and seven hours</font>

319
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:40,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">later the the third person in the court</font>

320
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:43,170
they wrote down that we had here a

321
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:49,480
responsibility to disclosure

322
00:19:43,170 --> 00:19:53,380
process and that was what we told<font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font>

323
00:19:49,480 --> 00:20:01,180
and in<font color="#E5E5E5"> return we were able</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to actually</font>

324
00:19:53,380 --> 00:20:03,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">publish our findings</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and with this</font>

325
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:04,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">responsible disclosure procedure we will</font>

326
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:06,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">tell them all we want to publish</font>

327
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:10,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">something and we give you X amount of</font>

328
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:12,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">days and then they could answer and say</font>

329
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:14,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">ah yes we have some comments</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> here maybe</font>

330
00:20:12,610 --> 00:20:19,240
maybe wait a little bit and we will

331
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:21,130
patch something but yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> we were we were</font>

332
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:23,650
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to actually keep the right to</font>

333
00:20:21,130 --> 00:20:30,100
publish<font color="#CCCCCC"> and that they would actually pay</font>

334
00:20:23,650 --> 00:20:35,500
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> any court costs and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> afterwards</font>

335
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:38,409
we had<font color="#CCCCCC"> also some press</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> echo here so yeah</font>

336
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:41,680
did we<font color="#E5E5E5"> did</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we get our to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our end goal so</font>

337
00:20:38,410 --> 00:20:45,550
yeah we had a lot of stress<font color="#CCCCCC"> for eight</font>

338
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:50,110
researchers with a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of things that we</font>

339
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:54,520
could never<font color="#CCCCCC"> really dream off we never</font>

340
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:58,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">really could answer these legal gray</font>

341
00:20:54,520 --> 00:21:01,660
area<font color="#E5E5E5"> issues</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so yeah about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

342
00:20:58,810 --> 00:21:05,820
compilation for example and the paper of

00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:12,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">the Technical University Munich is still</font>

344
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:16,240
not published so lessons learned<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

345
00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:18,570
don't panic<font color="#E5E5E5"> so just a standard thing I</font>

346
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:20,950
didn't panic<font color="#E5E5E5"> enough and well it's</font>

347
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:25,800
weekend and on Monday the<font color="#CCCCCC"> university</font>

348
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:25,800
will take care<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it no not really</font>

349
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:33,310
don't sign something blindly without

350
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:35,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">knowing what it is if we had just just</font>

351
00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:38,889
signed it we<font color="#E5E5E5"> just could</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have stopped</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">so it wasn't easy to explain to them</font>

355
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:53,200
what the<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem was and the FAU</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was a</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">and and if we put in things that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe</font>

362
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:18,540
legally not quite correct<font color="#E5E5E5"> and if you put</font>

the proper injunction proceedings and so

403
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:44,179
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> what where were we</font>

there was this<font color="#CCCCCC"> five step thing here we</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">the in this and this morning let it</font>

bring that up and<font color="#E5E5E5"> didn't say that do</font>

don't

485
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:09,390
but maybe the the danger<font color="#CCCCCC"> is still still</font>

486
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:13,590
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> so what what would we have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> liked</font>

487
00:29:09,390 --> 00:29:17,309
to have it would<font color="#E5E5E5"> have been very cool if</font>

00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:20,100
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> could cover this risk of being sued</font>

489
00:29:17,309 --> 00:29:22,230
by a<font color="#E5E5E5"> company so if the worst case</font>

490
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:24,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> comes to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pass if there is no</font>

have to pay that<font color="#CCCCCC"> ourselves maybe yeah</font>

494
00:29:34,650 --> 00:29:40,890
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can get some money back again if</font>

00:29:36,929 --> 00:29:47,970
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually win in the proceedings but</font>

496
00:29:40,890 --> 00:29:50,220
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> and yeah you can also lose so would</font>

497
00:29:47,970 --> 00:29:55,110
be cool if there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah some sort of</font>

00:29:50,220 --> 00:30:00,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">insurance</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for that and then yeah there's</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">competition</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then yeah that's also not</font>

504
00:30:17,550 --> 00:30:22,559
really included<font color="#E5E5E5"> so yeah those</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are the</font>

505
00:30:19,770 --> 00:30:24,240
two things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that aren't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really covered so</font>

506
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:27,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">it would be cool</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if there's some kind of</font>

507
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:29,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">insurance policy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for that then the</font>

508
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:35,780
research institutes if we could get some

509
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:38,400
support there<font color="#E5E5E5"> because we didn't quite</font>

510
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:41,040
there were a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people there who who</font>

511
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:44,070
actually made an effort<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

512
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:47,220
they really<font color="#E5E5E5"> try</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but in the end yeah</font>

513
00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:50,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">there there was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some kind of restriction</font>

514
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:53,820
and they couldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite go the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> whole way</font>

515
00:30:50,850 --> 00:30:55,889
and yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there was this feeling</font>

516
00:30:53,820 --> 00:31:00,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah there was some kind of</font>

517
00:30:55,890 --> 00:31:03,660
resistance<font color="#CCCCCC"> here in the system that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

518
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:05,540
didn't quite want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to stand by for</font>

519
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:10,020
example external also researchers

520
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:15,690
students<font color="#E5E5E5"> and also yes some kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of legal</font>

521
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:18,389
protection here and if they also if<font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

522
00:31:15,690 --> 00:31:22,950
can also be sued<font color="#CCCCCC"> for your research or</font>

523
00:31:18,390 --> 00:31:24,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">not but yeah so we we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thought about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

524
00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:32,700
but we didn't quite<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to pursue</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

525
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:38,610
Avenue then would be cool a legal basis

526
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:43,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">for a security research which would</font>

527
00:31:38,610 --> 00:31:50,129
ideally allow all<font color="#E5E5E5"> all kinds</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of analyses</font>

528
00:31:43,790 --> 00:31:56,190
including<font color="#E5E5E5"> decompiling because yeah we</font>

529
00:31:50,130 --> 00:31:58,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">had this copyright issue and in the DMCA</font>

the Digital<font color="#E5E5E5"> Millennium Copyright Act</font>

531
00:31:58,350 --> 00:32:05,610
since 2016 there is an exception<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

532
00:32:02,730 --> 00:32:08,220
security research and if we had such an

533
00:32:05,610 --> 00:32:12,179
exception then maybe many legal

534
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:15,150
questions here could be quenched<font color="#CCCCCC"> and we</font>

535
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:18,660
had a more security<font color="#E5E5E5"> concerning this</font>

536
00:32:15,150 --> 00:32:21,930
issue because<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah legal</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people can't</font>

537
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:25,140
not really judge<font color="#E5E5E5"> all of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> these technical</font>

538
00:32:21,930 --> 00:32:27,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">issues</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and that was our talk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> now it's</font>

a question<font color="#CCCCCC"> please come forward</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to one of</font>

546
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:59,570
the microphones<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I really think</font>

00:32:56,929 --> 00:33:01,039
questions<font color="#CCCCCC"> one point zero</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there's one</font>

553
00:33:19,759 --> 00:33:27,200
you for this<font color="#E5E5E5"> exciting story</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talking</font>

554
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:29,889
<font color="#CCCCCC">about the costs</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is not normal that</font>

555
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:33,409
one side bears all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> costs could you</font>

556
00:33:29,889 --> 00:33:38,990
please give an indication<font color="#E5E5E5"> how high the</font>

557
00:33:33,409 --> 00:33:42,169
costs were the costs of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the court so</font>

558
00:33:38,990 --> 00:33:45,320
there is here like a lawyer cost table

559
00:33:42,169 --> 00:33:48,950
that probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't is not called like</font>

560
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:54,019
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that that's just how the costs</font>

561
00:33:48,950 --> 00:33:58,309
are calculated and was like<font color="#E5E5E5"> two hundred</font>

562
00:33:54,019 --> 00:34:01,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">thousand euros</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the end and that's</font>

563
00:33:58,309 --> 00:34:04,549
just like the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> initial cost estimate</font>

564
00:34:01,610 --> 00:34:07,758
<font color="#E5E5E5">but that's not necessarily what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

565
00:34:04,549 --> 00:34:09,500
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> due in the end and then in the</font>

566
00:34:07,759 --> 00:34:18,219
end it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> the costs for the court</font>

567
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:22,099
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the lawyers yes or no</font>

568
00:34:18,219 --> 00:34:29,138
were<font color="#E5E5E5"> there consequences for one of you</font>

569
00:34:22,099 --> 00:34:31,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">aid with your employment yes yeah we are</font>

570
00:34:29,139 --> 00:34:35,569
two different<font color="#E5E5E5"> teams and one of eight</font>

571
00:34:31,879 --> 00:34:37,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">definitely there were consequences but</font>

572
00:34:35,569 --> 00:34:39,399
not for us<font color="#CCCCCC"> too</font>

573
00:34:37,069 --> 00:34:42,349
from a professional<font color="#E5E5E5"> perspective but</font>

574
00:34:39,399 --> 00:34:46,069
psychologically seen yes also<font color="#CCCCCC"> definitely</font>

575
00:34:42,349 --> 00:34:50,079
some consequences<font color="#CCCCCC"> I personally am glad</font>

576
00:34:46,069 --> 00:34:50,079
that I actually did that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I'm also</font>

577
00:34:52,829 --> 00:34:58,930
did your lawyers<font color="#E5E5E5"> ever answer the</font>

578
00:34:55,659 --> 00:35:02,530
question if what was there in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the legal</font>

579
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:04,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">texts as decompiling</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was that really the</font>

580
00:35:02,530 --> 00:35:07,450
same thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we think of as</font>

581
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:10,828
technicians when when we<font color="#E5E5E5"> use decompiling</font>

582
00:35:07,450 --> 00:35:13,240
it's just pressing a<font color="#CCCCCC"> 5 or is it just</font>

583
00:35:10,829 --> 00:35:16,839
change the compiled program<font color="#E5E5E5"> into another</font>

584
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:20,770
form yeah this is this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is why it's a</font>

585
00:35:16,839 --> 00:35:23,680
gray<font color="#CCCCCC"> area in Security Research that's</font>

586
00:35:20,770 --> 00:35:26,560
that's why we had this figure because

587
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:32,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">many things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> might actually fall under</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> D</font>

588
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:35,859
compilation there is this the the

589
00:35:32,859 --> 00:35:40,270
decompiling<font color="#E5E5E5"> paragraph in the law it</font>

590
00:35:35,859 --> 00:35:45,279
actually says yes it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> d compiling and</font>

591
00:35:40,270 --> 00:35:48,420
there is no further like<font color="#E5E5E5"> details on what</font>

592
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:52,569
is actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> understood as d compilation</font>

593
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:55,420
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I cannot really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> answer what lawyer</font>

594
00:35:52,569 --> 00:35:57,339
would say<font color="#CCCCCC"> as decompiling so this</font>

595
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:59,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">assembly could also be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> interpreted as</font>

596
00:35:57,339 --> 00:36:03,640
that and that's why a court needs to

597
00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:05,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">decide that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so we could</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> only say</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah we</font>

598
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:10,900
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really know if there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is there's</font>

599
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:13,599
any prey<font color="#E5E5E5"> pre-existing decisions here so</font>

600
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:16,420
that's something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that should</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font>

601
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:20,470
to be cleared up<font color="#E5E5E5"> legally speaking all we</font>

602
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:23,829
can say is yeah opinions and every judge

603
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:29,368
can can decide<font color="#CCCCCC"> differently here it's the</font>

604
00:36:23,829 --> 00:36:32,980
question<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the internet the question</font>

605
00:36:29,369 --> 00:36:43,060
that students and researchers have a

606
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:47,670
right to an insurance everyone has the

607
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:50,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">right for an insurance</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they if they</font>

608
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:53,890
use their own<font color="#E5E5E5"> software for looking for</font>

609
00:36:50,770 --> 00:36:56,849
<font color="#CCCCCC">security</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> problems yeah it would be</font>

610
00:36:53,890 --> 00:36:59,650
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> nice if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there if there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was a</font>

611
00:36:56,849 --> 00:37:01,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">insurance company that could</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

612
00:36:59,650 --> 00:37:05,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">insure against these risks</font>

613
00:37:01,770 --> 00:37:09,330
so we had this legal protection

614
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:12,090
insurance<font color="#E5E5E5"> they wouldn't have paid for</font>

615
00:37:09,330 --> 00:37:14,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">that exact case because we did</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

616
00:37:12,090 --> 00:37:18,360
afterwards and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we informed ourselves but</font>

617
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:20,670
yeah we discovered that<font color="#CCCCCC"> even if we had</font>

618
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:22,400
that legal protection<font color="#E5E5E5"> insurance maybe we</font>

619
00:37:20,670 --> 00:37:24,660
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> have had the same problem</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

620
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:31,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">those issues are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not covered by the</font>

621
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:35,190
police and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you should really be able</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

622
00:37:31,350 --> 00:37:43,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">look at it yourself</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but yeah that law</font>

623
00:37:35,190 --> 00:37:45,810
should<font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe be changed something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

624
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:49,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">that if someone finds data or obtains</font>

625
00:37:45,810 --> 00:37:53,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">data one way or another</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they also</font>

626
00:37:49,670 --> 00:37:58,760
support them did you contact the CCC<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

627
00:37:53,070 --> 00:38:01,530
how did that work<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah we have different</font>

00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:06,050
experiences<font color="#E5E5E5"> here I had a close contact</font>

629
00:38:01,530 --> 00:38:13,290
with CCC we also got<font color="#CCCCCC"> our lawyers</font>

630
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:15,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">recommended from CCC and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> two thumbs</font>

631
00:38:13,290 --> 00:38:20,880
up for for that if you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> something</font>

632
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:26,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">like that but we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> take</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

633
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:30,359
side<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't want to denigrate CCC here</font>

634
00:38:26,490 --> 00:38:33,000
maybe we had some miscommunication but

635
00:38:30,359 --> 00:38:38,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">yeah we didn't quite get as much support</font>

636
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:41,540
as<font color="#E5E5E5"> we maybe would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have liked the</font>

637
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:43,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">Nuremberg research group that was</font>

638
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:46,609
represented by<font color="#E5E5E5"> one lawyer but that</font>

639
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:50,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">lawyer didn't want to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> represent us and</font>

640
00:38:46,609 --> 00:38:54,750
although<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was maybe completely</font>

641
00:38:50,690 --> 00:38:58,940
completely detached experiences here

642
00:38:54,750 --> 00:39:00,869
with with<font color="#E5E5E5"> another exact same case</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font>

643
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:02,760
the lawyer didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to do it because</font>

644
00:39:00,869 --> 00:39:07,470
of conflicts of interest so yeah there

645
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:11,720
was that<font color="#CCCCCC"> one thank you very much for the</font>

646
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:15,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">presentation and the question with the</font>

647
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:19,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">unclarified parts and the</font>

648
00:39:15,410 --> 00:39:24,810
wouldn't it have<font color="#CCCCCC"> been nice</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to really get</font>

649
00:39:19,710 --> 00:39:29,790
a sentence of precedence<font color="#E5E5E5"> and not just to</font>

650
00:39:24,810 --> 00:39:33,390
settle in my<font color="#CCCCCC"> opinion in the end we could</font>

651
00:39:29,790 --> 00:39:36,180
have only proven<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it's not provable</font>

652
00:39:33,390 --> 00:39:39,450
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> didn't decompile</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so that is</font>

653
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:41,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> only thing that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ya would</font>

654
00:39:39,450 --> 00:39:42,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">have resulted in that process</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and maybe</font>

655
00:39:41,310 --> 00:39:43,320
we could<font color="#CCCCCC"> have lost</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then that would have</font>

656
00:39:42,990 --> 00:39:51,600
sucked

657
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:53,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">so yeah you think that the other the</font>

658
00:39:51,600 --> 00:40:01,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">other</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> side sort of should have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thought</font>

659

<font color="#E5E5E5">before court to the end the technologies</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">that the techniques that can you be used</font>

661
00:40:03,450 --> 00:40:08,310
in security research so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we had a</font>

662
00:40:05,430 --> 00:40:12,240
decision<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> were legal or not yeah</font>

663
00:40:08,310 --> 00:40:15,140
the problem is with this<font color="#E5E5E5"> issue is that</font>

664
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:18,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">we had eight researchers that also were</font>
