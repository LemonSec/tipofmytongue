1
00:00:09,257 --> 00:00:10,684
Welcome to our next talk.

2
00:00:10,684 --> 00:00:13,960
This is Anja Kohfeldt. And she will be talkin about "Lasers in Space".

3
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:17,397
Please give her a warm round of applause.

4
00:00:22,674 --> 00:00:28,294
Anja: Ja, hello everybody I also would like to welcome you to my talk.

5
00:00:28,294 --> 00:00:30,421
As the Angel already said.

6
00:00:30,421 --> 00:00:32,304
It is about lasers in space

7
00:00:32,304 --> 00:00:36,487
and they more than just: "Pew! Pew!"

8
00:00:36,742 --> 00:00:40,360
So that's what I want to talk about.

9
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:42,876
I'm a scientist at the Ferdinand-Braun-Institut in Berlin.

10
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:45,308
And I am a member of the Quantus Project group.

11
00:00:45,308 --> 00:00:52,025
The Quantus Project has the main goal, to build an optical atom interferometer, in space.

12
00:00:52,025 --> 00:00:58,048
And there we started at the drop tower in Bremen and now we are heading toward our sounding rocket

13
00:00:58,048 --> 00:01:02,643
which will be launched in november next year.

14
00:01:03,512 --> 00:01:08,932
In order to build this atom interferometer, we have to cool down atoms

15
00:01:08,963 --> 00:01:13,513
and for that we semiconductors(?) or we need lasers, at a specific wave length.

16
00:01:13,543 --> 00:01:16,955
And my job in this project is to build these laser modules.

17
00:01:16,955 --> 00:01:19,555
So now you know what I'm doing.

18
00:01:19,555 --> 00:01:22,212
My motivation for this talk today is:

19
00:01:22,243 --> 00:01:24,644
At first lasers are cool!

20
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:26,600
I think everybody will agree to that.

21
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,337
I hope so.

22
00:01:28,337 --> 00:01:31,454
In the past years there have been a lot of projects concerning lasers.

23
00:01:31,454 --> 00:01:40,018
For example building lasers cutters or building laser projectors, or pimping you laser pointer to laser gun, burning stuff.

24
00:01:40,018 --> 00:01:44,549
There are some pictures I found on the web.

25
00:01:44,549 --> 00:01:47,189
And than there is the space side.

26
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:51,749
This whole space stuff got more and more affordable in the previous years.

27
00:01:51,749 --> 00:01:56,339
There is more and more private activity in the space sector.

28
00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:58,363
For example private companies building launching systems.

29
00:01:58,363 --> 00:02:07,532
But there are also a lot of student and university programs to build there own satellite to make science in space, science in micro gravity.

30
00:02:07,532 --> 00:02:16,256
And I think when we just follow this development there also will be

31
00:02:16,256 --> 00:02:22,048
more, yeah, there also will be some hacking possible in space in the next years.

32
00:02:22,186 --> 00:02:25,067
There is also a personal motivation.

33
00:02:25,067 --> 00:02:30,066
Whenever I tell somebody that I am building lasers for space applications, there is always this:

34
00:02:30,066 --> 00:02:32,068
"Oh, you are building orbital death lasers!"

35
00:02:32,068 --> 00:02:35,035
No, I don't.

36
00:02:35,035 --> 00:02:40,753
[Someone booing in the audience, causing the others to breaks out into laughter.]

37
00:02:40,753 --> 00:02:45,074
Actually I'm very happy that I don't do that.

38
00:02:45,074 --> 00:02:50,387
This talk will be about other applications of lasers in space.

39
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:55,917
When you google lasers in space, you find a lot pictures like that.

40
00:02:55,917 --> 00:02:59,001
And they are beautiful. They really are.

41
00:02:59,001 --> 00:03:01,349
They have lasers, they have space.

42
00:03:01,349 --> 00:03:06,554
But I won't talk about that, because these lasers are on earth.

43
00:03:06,554 --> 00:03:10,304
They are guiding the stars very often or laser shows. Both applications.

44
00:03:10,304 --> 00:03:14,403
Very useful, very nice pictures. Here they are.

45
00:03:14,403 --> 00:03:17,837
Okay? Nice.

46
00:03:19,207 --> 00:03:25,757
So, I would like to talk about a little laser 101.

47
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:28,346
Telling what is a laser? What can you do with a laser? What is space?

48
00:03:28,346 --> 00:03:30,365
And, well, as I said already, the applications of it.

49
00:03:30,365 --> 00:03:35,366
Lasers. Laser: "light amplification of stimulated emission of radiation"

50
00:03:35,366 --> 00:03:37,292
Yeah, ok. We knew that.

51
00:03:37,292 --> 00:03:41,031
It's a device emitting monochromatic and coherent light.

52
00:03:41,031 --> 00:03:44,037
And that's nothing else but:

53
00:03:44,037 --> 00:03:49,331
Light with the same wavelength, in the same direction and the same polarization.

54
00:03:49,331 --> 00:03:55,064
With that properties you can focus photons on a very, very small area,

55
00:03:55,064 --> 00:03:58,032
because there are lot of photons doing the same thing.

56
00:03:58,032 --> 00:04:01,268
And that's why you have a very high power density

57
00:04:01,268 --> 00:04:08,115
and that is why you can use lasers for example for welding, for cutting

58
00:04:08,115 --> 00:04:14,064
or for delivering data over very, very long distance

59
00:04:14,064 --> 00:04:16,315
What do you need to build a laser?

60
00:04:16,315 --> 00:04:18,515
You need active medium.

61
00:04:18,515 --> 00:04:24,730
This active medium, or the electrons in this active medium, are stimulated by a pump.

62
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:29,590
This either an optical pump or an electrical pump or whatever pump.

63
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:36,954
And you need a resonator to sort the right photons.

64
00:04:36,954 --> 00:04:44,365
And when it comes to the classification of lasers, you basically vary the active medium.

65
00:04:44,365 --> 00:04:49,797
So for example there are solid state lasers, where you use a crystal.

66
00:04:49,797 --> 00:05:03,449
A very good example for a solid state laser is the neon doped XXX XXX laser. The YaC Laser, as we are used to call that.

67
00:05:03,449 --> 00:05:11,781
This laser or this type of laser is used industry, but you also find it in laser-light-shows.

68
00:05:11,781 --> 00:05:15,549
There are a lot of applications for that.

69
00:05:15,549 --> 00:05:18,396
In contrast there are semi-conductor lasers.

70
00:05:18,396 --> 00:05:20,314
They are a lot smaller.

71
00:05:20,314 --> 00:05:28,000
You see, the green one on the left is the YaC Laser, in the center you find the semiconductor laser.

72
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,415
They a are a lot smaller, they are cheaper, they are more efficient.

73
00:05:33,415 --> 00:05:39,447
And you can tune the wavelength over a certain range.

74
00:05:39,447 --> 00:05:46,980
As an example here, there is the indium gallium nitride laser, which you will find in you Blue-Ray-Player

75
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:54,897
or the aluminium gallium arsenide diode, which is commonly used in DVD-Players, and stuff like that.

76
00:05:54,897 --> 00:05:57,764
I think everybody owns at least one of them.

77
00:05:57,764 --> 00:05:59,514
There are gas lasers.

78
00:05:59,514 --> 00:06:01,565
For example helium-neon-lasers.

79
00:06:01,565 --> 00:06:07,963
The helium-neon-lasers built in the current wave mode.

80
00:06:07,963 --> 00:06:11,881
And it's now used, for example for calibration or in schools.

81
00:06:11,881 --> 00:06:16,999
And the CO2 laser is one with very, very high power density.

82
00:06:16,999 --> 00:06:20,294
It's a pulse laser, used for example for welding.

83
00:06:20,294 --> 00:06:30,013
And there are the dye lasers, which can tune the wave length on a very, very long range.

84
00:06:30,013 --> 00:06:35,180
They are very often used for spectroscopy, for example.

85
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:43,366
So whatever you want to do, you have to chose your laser your laser type with your application.

86
00:06:43,366 --> 00:06:49,564
And they vary a lot in their output power, in there mode, whether they are pulsed or not pulsed

87
00:06:49,564 --> 00:06:54,449
and their wavelength, but also in their size and complexity, yeah.

88
00:06:54,449 --> 00:06:57,604
And you just have to chose the right one.

89
00:06:57,604 --> 00:07:03,165
This is important especially when we are going to space.

90
00:07:03,165 --> 00:07:06,541
Here are some common applications for lasers.

91
00:07:06,541 --> 00:07:09,004
You use them in measuring, in optical data transmission,

92
00:07:09,004 --> 00:07:16,365
they are used in the multimedia sector and also in the production sector.

93
00:07:16,365 --> 00:07:22,133
But not only at home, or industrial or in medicine, but also in space.

94
00:07:22,133 --> 00:07:24,998
So space, here we are.

95
00:07:24,998 --> 00:07:31,515
The common definition of space is: "Hundred kilometres above the sea level."

96
00:07:31,515 --> 00:07:36,882
But whenever there is, for example an Apollo astronaut, when they are talking about space,

97
00:07:36,882 --> 00:07:44,172
they are talking about 50 miles, which is an older definition of space, based in the US.

98
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:49,116
You can go to space via satellite, you have the space station

99
00:07:49,116 --> 00:07:56,456
and sometimes at the space station you have an operator, like a person operating your experiment. Might be useful.

100
00:07:56,456 --> 00:08:05,400
There have been orbital experiments. Especially the times with a space shuttle.

101
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:12,974
And there are sounding rockets, which are rockets going up up to approximately a thousand kilometres max,

102
00:08:12,974 --> 00:08:20,333
and falling down, but in the meantime you can perform experiments in zero gravity.

103
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:23,282
Why do you want to go to space?

104
00:08:23,282 --> 00:08:25,950
Well, there are a lot of reasons.

105
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:33,531
For example the observation of distant galaxies, the earth weather,

106
00:08:33,531 --> 00:08:38,297
there are communication satellites, just to transfer data,

107
00:08:38,297 --> 00:08:41,563
you can or you want to perform science up there.

108
00:08:41,563 --> 00:08:45,998
For example because of the lack of gravity or the lack of atmosphere.

109
00:08:45,998 --> 00:08:53,497
There is navigation and there is also the military purpose, you can't deny that.

110
00:08:53,497 --> 00:08:57,333
But it's not that easy going to space.

111
00:08:57,333 --> 00:09:00,199
Whenever you want to go there, there are a lot of restrictions.

112
00:09:00,199 --> 00:09:02,366
For example the size and the weight.

113
00:09:02,366 --> 00:09:14,198
When you want to launch something into space, you have costs approximately four to five thousand dollar a kilo.

114
00:09:14,198 --> 00:09:19,665
Although this price is decreasing, it's still high enough.

115
00:09:19,665 --> 00:09:27,223
You are very limited in you power consumption, cause you don't have, i mean

116
00:09:27,223 --> 00:09:29,880
it's a closed system, right? You have you solar panel, but that's it.

117
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:36,602
And sometimes some other energy sources, which may disappear after a while.

118
00:09:36,602 --> 00:09:43,781
Everything you want to send up there has to survive the launch and sometimes it has to survive the landing.

119
00:09:43,781 --> 00:09:47,870
When it's coming back to earth, there might be applications where you might use that.

120
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:50,296
Very often there is no operator.

121
00:09:50,296 --> 00:09:55,875
Like no one pressing buttons. So everything has to run autonomously.

122
00:09:55,875 --> 00:10:04,963
And your stuff needs quite a long life time, cause you don't want to switch parts once a year on a satellite.

123
00:10:04,963 --> 00:10:09,770
So you normally don't do that.

124
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:13,414
So, as I said in the beginning, I'm a scientist.

125
00:10:13,414 --> 00:10:16,052
And this is a lab.

126
00:10:16,052 --> 00:10:19,889
It's not my lab, I'm very happy about that.

127
00:10:19,889 --> 00:10:25,832
But this is an experiment quite close to that what we want to do.

128
00:10:25,832 --> 00:10:31,953
And as you might assume, this is not a good idea to launch that.

129
00:10:31,953 --> 00:10:33,980
It won't hold.

130
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:38,665
It won't survive the launch and probably it won't work up there.

131
00:10:38,665 --> 00:10:43,248
So what did we do? You have to choose an appropriate technology.

132
00:10:43,248 --> 00:10:45,385
That's why we are using semiconductors for exmaple.

133
00:10:45,385 --> 00:10:48,157
They are much smaller, they are much more energy efficient.

134
00:10:48,157 --> 00:10:53,705
You have to space qualify all the components you are using.

135
00:10:53,705 --> 00:10:56,531
You have to take care of the materials you are using.

136
00:10:56,531 --> 00:11:03,199
You can't use whatever a XXX for example, because you have this out gassing problem.

137
00:11:03,199 --> 00:11:07,749
Your device has to operate in vaccum, very often at least.

138
00:11:07,749 --> 00:11:11,546
You have to minimize everything.

139
00:11:11,546 --> 00:11:14,082
You want to fix every part.

140
00:11:14,082 --> 00:11:22,367
You don't want to much movable parts. Because there won't be anybody to fix your setup, afterwards.

141
00:11:22,367 --> 00:11:26,564
And you have to work in a clean environment, when you integrate something.

142
00:11:26,564 --> 00:11:29,417
Dust is a problem, for example.

143
00:11:29,417 --> 00:11:32,915
You don't want to have any particles around.

144
00:11:32,915 --> 00:11:37,689
You have to test and characterize everything and once again and once again.

145
00:11:37,689 --> 00:11:43,876
And you have to document everything. Like more than everything.

146
00:11:43,876 --> 00:11:46,615
So this are some pictures of my lab.

147
00:11:46,615 --> 00:11:56,582
On this side, you see a characterization setup.

148
00:11:56,582 --> 00:12:00,115
In our lab, it's not clean room, yet!

149
00:12:00,115 --> 00:12:04,583
We are not working on a satellite mission, it's just a sounding rocket.

150
00:12:04,583 --> 00:12:08,084
But we wear these funny lab coats and funny hats.

151
00:12:08,084 --> 00:12:11,451
So maybe you see that person there in the middle, it's a colleague of mine.

152
00:12:11,451 --> 00:12:14,902
If you see that: "Hello!" :)

153
00:12:14,902 --> 00:12:19,964
And on the other side it's the integration station, of our lasers.

154
00:12:19,964 --> 00:12:25,415
And some setup around to characterize everything.

155
00:12:25,415 --> 00:12:29,020
So, just to show the result of our effort.

156
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:35,785
It's a semiconductor based master oscillator power amplifier, of the size of that.

157
00:12:35,785 --> 00:12:41,263
Its like 8 centimetres long and 2.5 centimetres wide.

158
00:12:41,263 --> 00:12:48,248
It has nor movable parts and it's a specific wavelength, cause we need that for our application.

159
00:12:48,248 --> 00:12:51,780
We want to cool down rubidium.

160
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:56,281
It has an output power greater than 1.2 Watts.

161
00:12:56,281 --> 00:12:57,743
So, how much is that?

162
00:12:57,743 --> 00:13:01,299
Well, a laser pointer has a 1 milliwatt.

163
00:13:01,299 --> 00:13:06,414
An illegal laser pointer has 100 milliwatt.

164
00:13:06,414 --> 00:13:10,708
And this is ten times stronger.

165
00:13:10,708 --> 00:13:13,066
And the efficiency we have now is 22%.

166
00:13:13,066 --> 00:13:22,664
When we fuck of the wavelength, when we don't care about that at all, than we can achieve an even higher efficiency and a higher output power.

167
00:13:22,664 --> 00:13:27,397
But in our application the wavelength is mandatory.

168
00:13:27,397 --> 00:13:31,883
So now, when it comes to testing you need some documents telling you, what to test.

169
00:13:31,883 --> 00:13:34,365
And how to test and so on.

170
00:13:34,365 --> 00:13:44,520
So, there are a couple of standards and most of the standards are based in the military sector.

171
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:51,401
The standard which is very important for us is, for example, the MIL-STD-883.

172
00:13:51,401 --> 00:14:00,129
Which describe test methods of micro circuits and thats a really huge document.

173
00:14:00,129 --> 00:14:05,444
It's about 630 pages thick.

174
00:14:05,444 --> 00:14:15,367
And it describes the purpose of a test, the apparatus, the test conditions and the procedure and the failure criteria

175
00:14:15,367 --> 00:14:19,929
...of environmental tests, of mechanical tests and of electrical tests.

176
00:14:19,929 --> 00:14:22,915
So in this picture down there you see our laser system.

177
00:14:22,915 --> 00:14:27,939
The silver cube is the entire laser system, we have in our experiment.

178
00:14:27,939 --> 00:14:33,963
It contains 8 lasers and a spectroscopy module and a switching module.

179
00:14:33,963 --> 00:14:38,218
And this setup is on a shaker.

180
00:14:38,218 --> 00:14:44,963
So here we are performing a random vibration test on acceptance level.

181
00:14:44,963 --> 00:14:51,177
And we passed. So I'm very, very happy about that.

182
00:14:51,177 --> 00:14:53,962
And of course there a lot more tests we have to perform.

183
00:14:53,962 --> 00:14:56,729
But it looks good, so far.

184
00:14:56,729 --> 00:15:03,998
So now we have our hardware, what else can we do with that than building weapons and atom interferometers?

185
00:15:03,998 --> 00:15:11,834
Of course we have the interferometer is a very common application.

186
00:15:11,834 --> 00:15:18,048
Just to name the LIDAR system, it's a combination of radar, but with light.

187
00:15:18,048 --> 00:15:23,265
And this one is used for as alterometer(?) for example.

188
00:15:23,265 --> 00:15:30,146
Or to map surfaces. For example of some distant planets, of the moon, of the earth, of whatever.

189
00:15:30,146 --> 00:15:36,397
Systems are sending out a beam

190
00:15:36,397 --> 00:15:41,580
and they are analysing the reflected beam concerning the phase shift

191
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:48,999
and than they now how far the reflector is away.

192
00:15:48,999 --> 00:15:54,950
And with that you can measure very precisely distance.

193
00:15:54,950 --> 00:16:04,935
You need that for example in docking operations. In the picture up there you see the ATV satellite docking station.

194
00:16:04,935 --> 00:16:16,538
I think it was in 2007. You have several other satellites, for example mapping the planet.

195
00:16:16,538 --> 00:16:19,178
Ant there is also another mission I would like to point out.

196
00:16:19,178 --> 00:16:24,550
This is the LISA mission, which wants to point out gravitational waves.

197
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:30,799
Unfortunately the LISA project cut down. And now it's just LISA Pathfinder.

198
00:16:30,799 --> 00:16:35,911
A proof-of-concet mission, which is scheduled in 2015.

199
00:16:35,911 --> 00:16:40,836
But there are of course a lot of more applications, I just picked out some which I fond interesting.

200
00:16:40,836 --> 00:16:48,544
Spectroscopy is also a very nice application.

201
00:16:48,544 --> 00:16:59,780
When it comes to spectroscopy, you analyse the beam concerning of the absorption or reflecting photons coming back.

202
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:09,054
So you are also sending up a laser beam and it comes back and you simply look what is coming back.

203
00:17:09,054 --> 00:17:15,116
And with that you can analyse matter with a chemical composition of matter around.

204
00:17:15,116 --> 00:17:26,168
For example on Curiosity, the Mars rover they are looking for methane gas by spectrography.

205
00:17:26,168 --> 00:17:34,653
So they have at least two spectrometers on board of this little guy.

206
00:17:34,653 --> 00:17:43,542
And another application which gains more and more importance in space are optical atomical clocks.

207
00:17:43,542 --> 00:17:53,551
It's a time keeping device, but optical clocks operating with lasers are even more precise than radio operated ones.

208
00:17:53,551 --> 00:18:01,499
And there are some new generations of optical atomic clocks, cause they are even more precise in space.

209
00:18:01,499 --> 00:18:10,385
For example there is the ACES mission, which is a french mission, which was scheduled at the end of this year.

210
00:18:10,385 --> 00:18:17,795
Unfortunately a newer launching date, but I think it won't be launched next year.

211
00:18:17,795 --> 00:18:20,902
Maybe you know even more than I do.

212
00:18:20,902 --> 00:18:31,070
And there is also another mission called X quest, which is still in preparation.

213
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:36,153
So, this is everything I have on measurement.

214
00:18:36,153 --> 00:18:43,685
Free space optical communication is maybe an application3, most of you know what it is.

215
00:18:43,685 --> 00:18:46,502
You have your optical carrier, the laser beam,

216
00:18:46,502 --> 00:18:52,283
and you modulate you data either with phase shifting or with binary on-off keying.

217
00:18:52,283 --> 00:18:57,380
The binary on-off keying is the most common one.

218
00:18:57,380 --> 00:19:03,319
Compared to the commonly used RF-transmission you can go over longer distances,

219
00:19:03,319 --> 00:19:07,986
it needs less power and you have a higher transmission rate.

220
00:19:07,986 --> 00:19:11,585
Still it depends on the weather and the atmosphere on earth, when you want transfer data down to earth.

221
00:19:11,585 --> 00:19:21,379
As an example I can name the Laser Communication Terminal.

222
00:19:21,379 --> 00:19:28,784
It's build from TISAD(?) and it was first tested on the satellite ARTEMIS.

223
00:19:28,784 --> 00:19:36,603
It had a downlink and an intersatellite bandwith of 50 Mbps. This was in 2001.

224
00:19:36,603 --> 00:19:50,473
In 2008 there was another inter-satellite connection between XXX and XXX and they received 5.5 Gbps.

225
00:19:53,838 --> 00:20:05,937
There's also another US mission ongoing. It's called the lunar laser communication demonstrator mission.

226
00:20:05,937 --> 00:20:11,386
On the lunar atmosphere dust environment explorer. This was launched in September this year.

227
00:20:11,386 --> 00:20:24,216
And in October they received a downlink of 622 mbps. So this is state of the art right now.

228
00:20:24,216 --> 00:20:29,914
So, that's everything I have... I still think lasers are cool!

229
00:20:29,914 --> 00:20:35,085
And I hope you agree with me that there are a lot of applications for lasers in space.

230
00:20:35,085 --> 00:20:48,474
And I also think that reaching space is challenging, but it's not impossible. It's pretty doable actually.

231
00:20:48,474 --> 00:20:58,308
There are some initiatives for non-professionals or for - I'm not sure how to call that - for you, for everybody.

232
00:20:58,308 --> 00:21:05,043
For example the amateur radio satellite organizations. They are worldwide.

233
00:21:05,043 --> 00:21:13,408
There are for example the rexusbexus experiments. These are sounding rockets and balloon experiments for students.

234
00:21:13,408 --> 00:21:23,146
There are for example the cubesat projects. They design satellites of the size of one liter, like that size.

235
00:21:23,146 --> 00:21:29,077
And they can go as piggyback payload, for example on commercial satellites.

236
00:21:29,077 --> 00:21:34,264
So this is an opportunity to get to space pretty cheap.

237
00:21:34,264 --> 00:21:42,300
I also want to name the Google Lunar X Prize with the part-time scientists as the last German team (I think).

238
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:55,627
They want to build a lunar rover and there are also a lot of other initiatives and projects which you can find.

239
00:21:55,627 --> 00:21:57,700
Thank you.

240
00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:04,441
[Applause]

241
00:22:04,441 --> 00:22:07,568
Thank you very much, Anja. Thank you very much.

242
00:22:07,568 --> 00:22:14,275
Now if you have questions, could you please line up at the microphones so we can record it?

243
00:22:14,275 --> 00:22:18,013
Our signal angel, do we have questions from the internet?

244
00:22:18,013 --> 00:22:21,967
- No, not right now... OK, then let's start with microphone 1.

245
00:22:21,967 --> 00:22:31,920
There is basically one thing: The French device is going to be launched in 2016. - OK.

246
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:47,511
And another thing... it's a double question actually. First of all: Why do you go in microgravity with [?] What do you promise yourself from that?

247
00:22:47,511 --> 00:23:00,810
The plan is to find the answer to the question whether Einstein's equivalence principle is still correct.

248
00:23:00,810 --> 00:23:09,508
The main goal is to go up with 2 species up there, measuring the gravitation, and compare that.

249
00:23:09,508 --> 00:23:23,092
And we need to go to space because it's more precise measuring up there. You have a longer measuring time.

250
00:23:23,092 --> 00:23:36,693
And another thing: I happen to know some friends of mine who work scientifically with lasers, and the alignment ends up to be depending on everybody working on that field...

251
00:23:36,693 --> 00:23:45,280
...professors touching random stuff and the experiment is ruined. How exactly do you harden a setup for launch?

252
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:52,585
I mean you have the G-loads, you have vibrations, you have random stuff happening... So how do you do that?

253
00:23:52,585 --> 00:23:56,809
I mean it's a quite sensitive setup if I'm not wrong.

254
00:23:56,809 --> 00:24:16,148
It's a very sensitive setup, that's true. But when you know that it has to work autonomously from the beginning, you can design it to make it independent of professors running around touching things, for example.

255
00:24:16,148 --> 00:24:31,367
Yeah, that's not the thing... How do you cope with misalignment for example. I mean you will have some mirrors, some beamsplitters or whatever... and if they get moved, that's it.

256
00:24:31,367 --> 00:24:41,416
- We use very very small components like very very small lenses and we glue them, we fix them on a bench, so you can't align them anymore.

257
00:24:41,416 --> 00:24:55,500
When we are integrating our stuff, then we're aligning that actively. So the laser is switched on and then we align the components that the output is what we expect it to be.

258
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:59,102
OK, let's have a question from the other microphone over here.

259
00:24:59,102 --> 00:25:05,030
First of all, thanks a lot for the straight overview talk. I just have a very quick remark about the Lisa mission.

260
00:25:05,030 --> 00:25:17,619
I'm very happy to announce that just recently we got fully funded by the European Space Agency and in 2034 we will fly with a 1.2 billion dollar budget.

261
00:25:17,619 --> 00:25:21,994
- Which mission?

262
00:25:21,994 --> 00:25:26,746
- The Lisa mission.

263
00:25:26,746 --> 00:25:29,894
Congratulations. Go ahead, please.

264
00:25:29,894 --> 00:25:42,151
My question is about... when you shoot something up and make experiments, you probably won't shoot one satellite for only your project.

265
00:25:42,151 --> 00:25:58,157
So are you working together with other departments and then you... like everyone gets one square meter for his experiments and then you shoot them up and all experiments run independently on one satellite?

266
00:25:58,157 --> 00:26:15,148
- It depends on what you are doing. In our experiment we have one rocket just for our experiment, but it's not just an [...] institute building that stuff. It's a cooperation of a lot of institutions and universities.

267
00:26:15,148 --> 00:26:26,590
And when it comes to these experimental satellites, they very often go as piggyback payloads, that means you have a commercial satellite.

268
00:26:26,590 --> 00:26:37,973
For example a communications satellite which is launched anyway and they're normally much smaller, so they're sitting just on the side and wait for the launch.

269
00:26:37,973 --> 00:26:59,314
When we're talking about piggyback payloads: Don't you have space trash problems because you can't just say people can go and shoot stuff up there if there is one space trash problem anyway?

270
00:26:59,314 --> 00:27:02,630
- I'm not sure I got the question...

271
00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:10,529
You say for example I could just build something and shoot it up as a piggyback payload...

272
00:27:10,529 --> 00:27:16,280
- Well, it's unfortunately not that easy of course. But it's not impossible.

273
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:25,951
Like some years ago or some decades ago, it was impossible for a private person to even think about building your own satellite.

274
00:27:25,951 --> 00:27:35,696
But you need some funding, you need a group basically and maybe you're lucky and you'll get to your goal at the end.

275
00:27:35,696 --> 00:27:45,513
- So I can't just... if I get to build the rocket myself and shoot it up... Is it allowed? Just from the law?

276
00:27:45,513 --> 00:27:47,365
- I don't think so...

277
00:27:47,365 --> 00:27:49,758
- OK.

278
00:27:49,758 --> 00:28:00,901
- I have one question: You mentioned the mission concerning analyzing the moon dust and this moon mission.

279
00:28:00,901 --> 00:28:10,480
But you didn't mention who was the partners - is it a project by ESA, is it a project of a cooperation of several agencies or is it a private...

280
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,066
- It's a NASA project.

281
00:28:12,066 --> 00:28:26,086
- Ok, thank you. And then another question: A lot of [?] come down by Gigahertz and those frequencies are also reserved for astronomers.

282
00:28:26,086 --> 00:28:42,940
Do we have some feedback from the astronomer community, are they concerned that their frequency will be less and less laser communication we will get... other optical applications or other laser applications?

283
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:53,019
What's the standing point of the astronomy community? Because they're also using the high frequencies in the 5.5 Gigahertz.

284
00:28:53,019 --> 00:28:59,833
Um, I have no feedback on that...

285
00:28:59,833 --> 00:29:05,318
OK. Any more questions from the internet? How about our signal angel?

286
00:29:05,318 --> 00:29:06,852
No questions from the internet. OK.

287
00:29:06,852 --> 00:29:13,436
Then, Anja, once again: Thank you very much!
