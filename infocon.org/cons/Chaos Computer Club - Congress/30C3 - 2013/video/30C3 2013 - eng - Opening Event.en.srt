*Intro Video*

2
00:03:33,541 --> 00:03:37,108
Greetings my friends.

3
00:03:38,401 --> 00:03:42,994
We are all interested in the future,

4
00:03:42,994 --> 00:03:50,666
for that is where you and I are going to spend the rest of our lives.

5
00:03:52,128 --> 00:03:55,753
You are interested in the unknown,

6
00:03:55,753 --> 00:04:00,282
the mysterious, the unexplainable

7
00:04:00,282 --> 00:04:04,770
and this is why you are here.

8
00:04:05,832 --> 00:04:08,341
And that's why I say:

9
00:04:08,341 --> 00:04:13,358
Thank you for coming to the 30th Chaos Communication Congress.

10
00:04:13,404 --> 00:04:19,045
*applause*

11
00:04:25,815 --> 00:04:30,731
So it's been 30 years and we have come a long way.

12
00:04:30,731 --> 00:04:35,462
From beeing a small group of nerds and geeks

13
00:04:35,462 --> 00:04:40,212
whose advice were mostly ignored,

14
00:04:40,212 --> 00:04:43,489
it all became a huge movement,

15
00:04:43,489 --> 00:04:48,410
a huge movement of people whose advise is still mostly ignored.

16
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:52,991
*laughter and applause*

17
00:04:57,623 --> 00:05:01,389
But this year's congress has no motto.

18
00:05:01,389 --> 00:05:03,968
Why is that?

19
00:05:03,968 --> 00:05:06,400
Usually we come up with some kind of twist

20
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:15,188
and somebody has an idea to convey a message to the community, as well as the public.

21
00:05:16,881 --> 00:05:23,612
But this year there is no motto. Because this year we are speechless.

22
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,071
Our mind is empty.

23
00:05:29,333 --> 00:05:32,740
There was no message that was strong enough

24
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:37,365
and that was describing what was actually going on inside us.

25
00:05:37,365 --> 00:05:42,201
Nobody came up with something.

26
00:05:42,201 --> 00:05:45,507
So there is no motto.

27
00:05:45,507 --> 00:05:49,968
Because we found ourselves waking up.

28
00:05:49,968 --> 00:05:53,402
Waking up from a bad dream.

29
00:05:53,402 --> 00:05:59,701
Waking up from the bad dream to a reality that was even worse.

30
00:05:59,701 --> 00:06:03,966
And a reality that can no longer be ignored.

31
00:06:03,966 --> 00:06:08,454
We woke up into "Hollywood Reality",

32
00:06:08,454 --> 00:06:14,553
you know where an agent on TV puts your soul up on screen

33
00:06:14,553 --> 00:06:20,759
with a few clicks and no apparent skills involved.

34
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:26,419
And usually we have been laughing a lot when this happens.

35
00:06:28,573 --> 00:06:33,167
But this year we stopped laughing. It's not funny.

36
00:06:36,906 --> 00:06:43,828
Because this agent, this is an digital Agent Orange.

37
00:06:45,152 --> 00:06:51,865
This agent came and took the leaves from the forest where we used to live and flourish.

38
00:06:51,865 --> 00:06:59,014
The forest that feeds us. The forest that brings value to our lives.

39
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:06,339
That allows us to learn, to evolve and to have fun.

40
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:12,664
So what shall we do now?

41
00:07:12,664 --> 00:07:16,730
How can we deal with this situation?

42
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:21,319
Is there anything left to do or is it just "Game Over"?

43
00:07:21,319 --> 00:07:26,788
Shall we just give the money back to the shareholders and quit?

44
00:07:26,788 --> 00:07:31,517
Can we rewind history and start over from scratch?

45
00:07:31,517 --> 00:07:38,406
Probably not. We have embarked on a trend that looks irreversible.

46
00:07:40,345 --> 00:07:47,634
But let's rewind a bit nevertheless. 
Let's look back in time.

47
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:57,601
So 1984 was not only the first year when this congress came to life, it was also a tale, a scary tale.

48
00:07:58,878 --> 00:08:03,248
But as it turned out not a fairy tale.

49
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:09,454
And we told the world that this was not an instruction manual, you know.

50
00:08:09,454 --> 00:08:14,656
But something to be aware of. But nobody listened.

51
00:08:16,272 --> 00:08:23,139
But also in 1984 we came together as a community, as a group of like minded people,

52
00:08:23,139 --> 00:08:27,904
that shared knowledge and discussed the future.

53
00:08:27,904 --> 00:08:33,836
We saw the risks but we also saw the chances, and we still do.

54
00:08:33,836 --> 00:08:39,216
And because the best way to predict the future is to invent it,

55
00:08:39,216 --> 00:08:46,831
the hackers formed the net based on their core principles: trust and friendship.

56
00:08:47,831 --> 00:08:56,658
Turns out this was not enough. So now it's 2013.

57
00:08:56,658 --> 00:09:03,962
We are way ahead in the 21st century that was once the glorious future we were all longing for.

58
00:09:03,962 --> 00:09:11,133
But now it all seems so broken and so useless.

59
00:09:11,133 --> 00:09:17,496
What we need to do now? We have to reinvent the net.

60
00:09:18,666 --> 00:09:21,202
We have to rethink the net.

61
00:09:21,202 --> 00:09:30,361
We need to redesign our forest so that we can still live in harmony, but we are also save from the predators.

62
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:35,403
What we need is a New Standards Alliance.

63
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:45,651
A force so strong, that it can at least slow the pace of global surveillance to get some control back.

64
00:09:45,651 --> 00:09:52,707
You can do it. And you can start here.

65
00:09:54,523 --> 00:09:57,754
Right here, right now.

66
00:09:59,185 --> 00:10:04,290
And your conscience matters!

67
00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:08,400
Always do what your heart tells you.

68
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:11,135
Do not follow the money.

69
00:10:11,135 --> 00:10:17,291
If there's one thing we've learned from this lost year it's that each of us can make a difference.

70
00:10:17,291 --> 00:10:23,533
One person can start a wave that can't be stopped.

71
00:10:23,533 --> 00:10:28,840
Oh and by the way we have an appointment.

72
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:31,856
We have an appointment to make.

73
00:10:31,856 --> 00:10:38,786
To make it easier for all of you, to move quickly and without fear

74
00:10:38,786 --> 00:10:47,250
I hereby declare you being genuine and authorized popes.

75
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:51,450
*laughter and applause*

76
00:10:51,450 --> 00:11:00,812
And as a pope is someone who is not under the authority of the authorities, you should do well now.

77
00:11:00,812 --> 00:11:06,293
So protected from all the evil in the world I leave you and thank you again for being awesome

78
00:11:06,293 --> 00:11:11,500
and for wanting to be a part of the solution.

79
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:17,309
"Carpe Noctem", use the night, have fun and let's save the world!

80
00:11:17,309 --> 00:11:22,582
*applause*
